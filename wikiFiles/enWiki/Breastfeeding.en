'''Breastfeeding''' is the feeding of an [[infant]] or young [[child]] with [[breast milk]] directly from female human [[breast]]s (i.e., via [[lactation]]) rather than using infant formula from a [[baby bottle]] or other container.  Babies have a [[sucking reflex]] that enables them to suck and swallow milk.   Experts recommend that children be breastfed within one hour of birth, exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months, and then breastfed until age two with age-appropriate, nutritionally adequate and safe complementary foods.<ref name="savethechildren.org">http://www.savethechildren.org/atf/cf/%7B9def2ebe-10ae-432c-9bd0-df91d2eba74a%7D/STATE-OF-THE-WORLDS-MOTHERS-REPORT-2012-FINAL.PDF</ref><ref name="Kramer_2002">{{cite journal |author=Kramer M, Kakuma R |editor1-last=Kramer |editor1-first=Michael S |title=Optimal duration of exclusive breastfeeding |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue= 1|pages=CD003517 |year=2002 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003517 |pmid=11869667}}</ref><ref name="Baker_2003">{{cite journal |author=Baker R |title=Human milk substitutes.

{{Main|History of breastfeeding}}

In the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman empire]]s, women usually fed only their own children.  However, breastfeeding began to be seen as something too common to be done by royalty, and [[wet nurse]]s were employed to breastfeed the children of the royal families.  This was extended over the ages, particularly in western Europe, where [[nobility|noble women]] often made use of wet nurses. But lower class women breastfed their infants and used a wet nurse only if they were unable to feed their own infant. Attempts were made in 15th century Europe to use cow or goat milk, but these attempts were not successful. In the 18th century, flour or cereal mixed with broth were introduced as substitutes for breastfeeding, but this did not have a favorable outcome either.

During the early 1900s breastfeeding started to be viewed  negatively by Western societies, especially in Canada and the USA. These societies considered it a low class and uncultured practice, viewing it with a certain degree of disgust.<ref name=naoo>{{Cite journal |title=The One Best Way?: Breastfeeding History, Politics, and Policy in Canada |first=Tasnim |last=Nathoo |first2=Aleck |last2=Ostry |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ.

Not all the properties of [[breast milk]] are understood, but its [[nutrient]] content is relatively stable. Breast milk is made from nutrients in the mother's [[bloodstream]] and bodily stores. Breast milk has just the right amount of [[fat]], [[sugar]], [[water]], and [[protein]] that is needed for a baby's growth and development.<ref name=HHS /> Because breastfeeding uses an average of 500 [[calories]] a day, it helps the mother lose weight after giving birth.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dewey KG, Heinig MJ, Nommwen LA |title=Maternal weight-loss patterns during the menstrual cycle |journal=Am J Clin Nutr |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=162–6 |year=1993 |pmid=8338042 }}</ref> The composition of breast milk changes depending on how long the baby nurses at each session, as well as on the age of the child.

A study has also shown that infants who are bottle-fed in early infancy are more likely to empty the bottle or cup in late infancy than those who are breastfed. "Bottle-feeding, regardless of the type of milk, is distinct from feeding at the breast in its effect on infants' self-regulation of milk intake."

In children who are at risk for developing allergic diseases (defined as at least one parent or sibling having [[atopy]]), atopic syndrome can be prevented or delayed through exclusive breastfeeding for four months, though these benefits may not be present after four months of age.<ref name="pmid18166574">{{cite journal |author=Greer FR, Sicherer SH, Burks AW |title=Effects of early nutritional interventions on the development of atopic disease in infants and children: the role of maternal dietary restriction, breastfeeding, timing of introduction of complementary foods, and hydrolyzed formulas |journal = [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=121 |issue=1 |pages=183–91 |year=2008 |pmid=18166574 |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-3022}}</ref> However, the key factor may be the age at which non-breastmilk is introduced rather than duration of breastfeeding.<ref name="pmid10496824">{{cite journal |author=Oddy WH, Holt PG, Sly PD, ''et al.'' |title=Association between breast feeding and asthma in 6 year old children: findings of a prospective birth cohort study |journal=BMJ |volume=319 |issue=7213 |pages=815–9 |year=1999 |pmid=10496824 |pmc=314207 |doi=10.1136/bmj.319.7213.815}}</ref> [[Atopic dermatitis]], the most common form of [[eczema]], can be reduced through exclusive breastfeeding beyond 12 weeks in individuals with a family history of atopy, but when breastfeeding beyond 12 weeks is combined with other foods incidents of eczema rise irrespective of family history.<ref name="pmid6734490">{{cite journal |author=Pratt HF |title=Breastfeeding and eczema |journal=Early Hum.

===Necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants===
[[Necrotizing enterocolitis]] (NEC) is an acute inflammatory disease in the intestines of infants. Necrosis or death of intestinal tissue may follow. It is mainly found in [[premature birth]]s. In one study of 926 preterm infants, NEC developed in 51 infants (5.5%). The death rate from necrotizing enterocolitis was 26%. NEC was found to be six to ten times more common in infants fed formula exclusively, and three times more common in infants fed a mixture of breast milk and formula, compared with exclusive breastfeeding. In infants born at more than 30 weeks, NEC was twenty times more common in infants fed exclusively on formula.<ref name="pmid1979363">{{cite journal |author=Lucas A, Cole TJ |title=Breast milk and neonatal necrotising enterocolitis |journal=Lancet |volume=336 |issue=8730 |pages=1519–23 |year=1990 |pmid=1979363| doi = 10.1016/0140-6736(90)93304-8}}</ref> A 2007 meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials found "a marginally statistically significant association" between breastfeeding and a reduction in the risk of NEC.<ref name=AHRQ2007/>

===Other long term health effects===
Although one study showed no evidence that breastfeeding offers protection against allergies, another study showed a positive correlation between breastfeeding and a lower risk of asthma. This study also showed that breastfeeding protects against allergies, and respiratory and intestinal infections.<ref name="pmid17855282">{{cite journal |author=Kramer MS, Matush L, Vanilovich I, ''et al.'' |title=Effect of prolonged and exclusive breast feeding on risk of allergy and asthma: cluster randomised trial |journal=BMJ |volume=335 |issue=7624 |pages=815 |year=2007 |pmid=17855282 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39304.464016.AE |pmc=2034727}}</ref><ref name=Mead>{{cite journal |author= Mead MN |title= Contaminants in human milk: weighing the risks against the benefits of breastfeeding |journal= Environ Health Perspect |volume=116 |issue=10 |pages=A426–34 |year=2008 |pmid=18941560 |url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/2008/116-10/focus.html |pmc= 2569122 |doi= 10.1289/ehp.116-a426}}</ref>

In a paper  selected by [[UNICEF]] as the
“Breastfeeding Paper of the Month” it was suggested that  breastfed babies have a better chance of good dental health than artificially-fed infants because of the effects of breastfeeding on the development of the oral cavity and airway.  It was thought that with fewer malocclusions, breastfed children may have a reduced need for orthodontic intervention.  The report also suggested that  children with the proper development of a well rounded, "U-shaped" dental arch, which is found more commonly in breastfed children, may have fewer problems with snoring and sleep apnea in later life.<ref>[http://www.brianpalmerdds.com/bfeed_oralcavity.htm Breastfeeding & the Oral Cavity<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Connection to intelligence===
Studies have examined whether breastfeeding in infants is associated with higher [[intelligence]] later in life. Possible association between breastfeeding and intelligence is not clear.  The 2007 review for the AHRQ found "no relationship between breastfeeding in term infants and cognitive performance"<ref name=AHRQ2007/> and in 2006, a [[prospective cohort study]], sibling pairs analysis, and [[meta-analysis]], concluded that "Breast feeding has little or no effect on intelligence in children."<ref name="pmid17020911">{{cite journal |author=Der G, Batty GD, Deary IJ|title=Effect of breast feeding on intelligence in children: prospective study, sibling pairs analysis, and meta-analysis|journal=BMJ |volume=333 |issue=7575|pages=945 |year=2006 |pmid=17020911|doi=10.1136/bmj.38978.699583.55 |pmc=1633819}}</ref> The researchers found that "Most of the observed association between breast feeding and cognitive development is the result of [[confounding]] by maternal intelligence."<ref name="pmid17020911"/>

However a 2007 review for the [[World Health Organization]] "suggests that breastfeeding is associated with increased cognitive development in childhood." The review also states that "The issue remains of whether the association is related to the properties of breastmilk itself, or whether breastfeeding enhances the bonding between mother and child, and thus contributes to intellectual development." <ref name=WHO2007/> A 2005 study using data on 2,734 sibling pairs from the [[National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health]] "provide[d] persuasive evidence of a causal connection between breastfeeding and intelligence."<ref name="pmid16336548">{{cite journal |author=Evenhouse E, Reilly S|title=Improved estimates of the benefits of breastfeeding using sibling comparisons to reduce selection bias |journal=Health Serv Res |volume=40 |issue=6 Pt 1 |pages=1781–802 |year=2005 |pmid=16336548|doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6773.2005.00453.x |pmc=1361236}}</ref>  In another study, cited as "the largest randomized trial ever conducted in the area of human lactation," between 1996 and 1997 maternity hospitals and [[polyclinic]]s in [[Belarus]] were randomized to receive or not receive breastfeeding promotion modeled on the [[Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative]].<ref name="pmid18458209">{{cite journal |author=Kramer MS, Aboud F, Mironova E, ''et al.'' |title=Breastfeeding and child cognitive development: new evidence from a large randomized trial |journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=578–84 |year=2008 |pmid=18458209 |url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/65/5/578 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.65.5.578}}</ref> Of 13,889 infants born at these hospitals and polyclinics and followed up in 2002–2005, those who had been born in hospitals and polyclinics receiving breastfeeding promotion had IQs that were 2.9–7.5 points higher (which was significantly higher).<ref name="pmid18458209"/> Since (among other reasons) a randomized trial should control for maternal IQ, the authors concluded in a 2008 paper that the data "provide strong evidence that prolonged and exclusive breastfeeding improves children's cognitive development."<ref name="pmid18458209"/>

====Genetic studies====
In 2007, A. Caspi et al. published a study “Moderation of breastfeeding effects on the IQ by genetic variation in fatty acid metabolism.” The authors noted that there is currently agreement in the scientific community that both genetic and environmental factors effect specific traits rather than one or another. This fact inspired them to try to find a gene that mediates the well-researched phenomenon that children who are breast-fed have higher IQ.  In their study they found that  babies with a specific version of the [[FADS2]] gene demonstrated an IQ averaging 7 points higher if breastfed, compared with babies with a less common version of the gene who showed no improvement when breastfed.<ref name="pmid17984066">{{cite journal |author=Caspi A, Williams B, Kim-Cohen J, ''et al.'' |title=Moderation of breastfeeding effects on the IQ by genetic variation in fatty acid metabolism |journal=[[Proc.

==Benefits for mothers==
[[File:Zanzibar 31.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Zanzibar]]i woman breastfeeding]]

Breastfeeding is a cost effective way of feeding an infant, providing nourishment for a child at a small cost to the mother. Frequent and exclusive breastfeeding usually delays the return of fertility through [[lactational amenorrhea method|lactational amenorrhea]], though breastfeeding is an imperfect means of [[birth control]]. During breastfeeding beneficial [[hormone]]s are released into the mother's body<ref name=CDC /> and the maternal bond can be strengthened.<ref name=HHS /> Breastfeeding is possible throughout [[pregnancy]], but generally milk production will be reduced at some point.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Feldman S | title = Nursing Through Pregnancy | journal = New Beginnings | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 116–118, 145 | publisher = La Leche League International |date=July–August 2000 | url = http://www.lalecheleague.org/NB/NBJulAug00p116.html | accessdate = 2007-03-15}}</ref> Children who are not breastfed are almost six times more likely to die by the age of one month than children who receive at least some breastmilk.<ref>WHO "strategic directions for improving the health and development of children and adolescents", WHO/FCH/CAH/02.21, Geneva: Department of Child and Adolescent Health and Development, World Health Organization.</ref>

===Bonding===
[[File:A few moments more.jpg|thumb|Infant nursing shortly after birth]]

According to some authorities, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that early skin-to-skin contact (also called [[kangaroo care]]) of mother and baby stimulates breast feeding behavior in the baby.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cornall|first=D |title=A review of the breastfeeding literature relevant to osteopathic practice|journal=International Journal of Osteopathic Medicine |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=61–66 |year=2011|month=June |doi=10.1016/j.ijosm.2010.12.003 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746068910001392}}</ref> Newborn infants who are immediately placed on their mother’s skin have a natural instinct to latch on to the breast and start nursing, typically within one hour of being born.  It is thought that immediate skin-to-skin contact provides a form of imprinting that makes subsequent feeding significantly easier. The [[World Health Organization]] reports that in addition to more successful breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact between a mother and her newborn baby immediately after delivery also reduces crying, improves mother to infant interaction, and keeps baby warm.  According to studies quoted by [[UNICEF]], babies have been observed to  naturally follow a unique process which leads to a first breastfeed.   After birth, babies who are placed skin to skin on their mothers chest will:

*Initially babies cry briefly – a very distinctive birth cry
*Then they will enter a stage of relaxation, recovering from the birth
*Then the baby will start to wake up
*Then begin to move, initially little movements, perhaps of the arms, shoulders and head
*As these movements increase he will actually start to crawl towards the breast
*Once he has found the breast and therefore his food source, he will tend to rest for a little while. Often this can be mistaken as the baby is not hungry or wanting to feed
*However after his rest he will start to familiarise himself with the breast, perhaps by nuzzling, smelling and licking before he finally attaches
*Once he has suckled for a period of time, he will come off the breast and fall asleep.

Providing that there are no interruptions, all babies are said to follow this process and it is suggested that trying to rush the process or interruptions such as removing the baby to weigh him/her is counter-productive and may lead to problems at subsequent breastfeeds.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.unicef.org.uk/BabyFriendly/Resources/Guidance-for-Health-Professionals/Learning-about-breastfeeding/Skin-to-skin-contact/ The Baby Friendly Initiative | Resources | Skin-to-skin contact<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

If the mother is away, an alternative caregiver may be able to feed the baby with breast milk expressed with a [[breast pump]].

===Hormone release===
Breastfeeding releases [[oxytocin]] and [[prolactin]], hormones that relax the mother and make her feel more nurturing toward her baby.<ref name=Dettwyler_1995>{{cite book | author=Stuart-Macadam P, [[Kathy Dettwyler|Dettwyler K]] | title = Breastfeeding: biocultural perspectives | pages = 131 | publisher = Aldine de Gruyter | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0-202-01192-9 }}</ref> This hormone release can help to enable sleep even where a mother may otherwise be having difficulty sleeping. Breastfeeding soon after giving birth increases the mother's oxytocin levels, making her uterus contract more quickly and reducing bleeding. Pitocin, a synthetic hormone used to make the uterus contract during and after labour, is structurally modelled on oxytocin. Syntocinon, another synthetic oxytocic, is commonly used in Australia and the UK rather than Pitocin.<ref name=Chua>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.1994.tb11950.x |author=Chua S, Arulkumaran S, Lim I, Selamat N, Ratnam S |title=Influence of breastfeeding and nipple stimulation on postpartum uterine activity |journal=Br J Obstet Gynaecol |volume=101 |issue=9 |pages=804–5 |year=1994 |pmid=7947531}}</ref>

====Gestational changes====
Dramatic changes occur in a pregnant woman’s metabolism and body composition as she accommodates the demands of providing for the nutritional needs of the growing fetus, and metabolizing for two. In anticipation of lactation, the mother accumulates some stores of [[visceral fat]], but most of it is stored as subcutaneous fat in the thighs, arms, buttocks, and breasts.<ref name=Villamor>{{cite journal |author=Villamor E, Cnattingius S |title=Interpregnancy weight change and risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes: a population-based study |journal=Lancet |volume=368 |pages=1164–1170 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69473-7 |issue=9542 |pmid=17011943}}</ref>  This shift in fat content leads to increased [[insulin]] production, [[insulin resistance]], and circulating lipid levels in the mother.
Studies have indicated that gestational weight gain (GWG) may contribute to complications during labor and delivery and it is the most reliable factor in predicting postpartum weight retention (PPWR).<ref>Cedergren M. Effects of gestational weight gain and body mass index on obstetric outcome in Sweden. Int J Gynaecol Obstet 2006;93:269 –74.</ref>  In general, the more weight that women put on during pregnancy, the more weight that they retain afterward.
Interventions to restrain GWG in the United States and elsewhere have had mixed results in reducing PPWR.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Polley BA, Wing RR, Sims CJ | year = 2002 | title = Randomized controlled trial to prevent excessive weight gain in pregnant women | url = | journal = Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord | volume = 26 | issue = 11| pages = 1494–502 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ijo.0802130 | pmid = 12439652 }}</ref> The recent recognition of PPWR’s influence on later chronic diseases has brought a surge in data analysis. In fact, the proportion of US women who gain weight excessively during pregnancy is growing. In 2005, 20.6% gained 18.2&nbsp;kg (40&nbsp;lb), the upper limit recommended by the Institute of Medicine.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Martin JA, Hamilton BE, Sutton PD ''et al.'' | year = 2007 | title = Births: final data for 2005 | url = | journal = Natl Vital Stat Rep | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 1–104 }}</ref>  
Recommended weight gains during pregnancy vary according to maternal baseline characteristics. The [[Institute of Medicine]] has established guidelines where women who are underweight  (BMI less than 18.5) are encouraged to gain 13 to 18&nbsp;kg; women who are at normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9) are encouraged to gain 11–16&nbsp;kg; those who are overweight (BMI 25-29.9) are suggested to gain 7–11&nbsp;kg; and those who are obese I (BMI 30-34.9) are recommended to gain 5–9&nbsp;kg.<ref>Committee to Reexamine IOM Pregnancy Weight Guidelines, Food and Nutrition Board, and Board on Children, Youth and Families. Weight gain during pregnancy: Reexamining the guidelines. Institute of Medicine and National Research Council. http://www.nap.edu. Accessed 30 November 2011.</ref> These recommendations are variable and are meant to inform an [[obstetrician]] in caring for a pregnant woman.  Extreme gains in visceral fat can put women at higher risk of cardiovascular and glycemic disorders later in life.

====Postpartum changes====
[[Image:Breastfeeding a baby.JPG|thumb|right|Postpartum bonding]]
After birth, the fat stores created during pregnancy are primed to be metabolized through lactation. Several investigators have explored the relation between duration of lactation and postpartum weight change, and found a variety of outcomes. Overall, it has been observed that prolonged exclusivity of breastfeeding is associated with increased weight loss when controlling for gestational weight gain and postpartum caloric intake and expenditure.<ref>Kac G, Benicio MH, Velasquez-Melendez G, Valente JG, Struchiner CJ. Breastfeeding and postpartum weight retention in a cohort of Brazilian women" ''Am J Clin Nutr'' 2004;79:487–493.</ref>
Dietary intake and energy expenditure affect how much weight women lose with [[lactation]]. When nutrition is readily available, women compensate for increased energy demands by increasing intake and decreasing energy expenditure, rather than mobilizing fat stores.

===Natural postpartum infertility===
Breastfeeding may delay the return to fertility for some women by suppressing ovulation. A breastfeeding woman may not [[ovulate]], or have regular periods, during the entire lactation period. The period in which ovulation is absent differs for each woman. This [[lactational amenorrhea]] has been used as an imperfect form of natural contraception, with greater than 98% effectiveness during the first six months after birth if specific nursing behaviors are followed.<ref name=Price_&Robinson_2004>{{cite book | author=Price C | coauthors=Robinson S | title=Birth: Conceiving, Nurturing and Giving Birth to Your Baby | pages = 489 | publisher=McMillan | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-4050-3612-5}}</ref> It is possible for women to ovulate within two months after birth while fully breastfeeding and get pregnant again.

===Long-term health effects===

===Financial benefits===
The American Academy of Pediatrics states that breast feeding also has economic health benefits because breastfeeding
results in reduced health care costs. The significantly lower incidence of illness in the breastfed infant also allows the parents more time for attention to siblings and other family duties and reduces parental absence from work and lost income. Using figures for the year 1993, it was estimated that the cost of purchasing infant formula for the first year after birth was $855. During the first 6 weeks of lactation, maternal caloric intake is no greater for the breastfeeding mother than for the nonlactating mother. After that period, food and fluid intakes are greater, but the cost of the increased caloric intake is about half the cost of purchasing formula, resulting in a saving of about $400.<ref>[http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/100/6/1035.full.pdf+html Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Methods and considerations==
There are many books and videos to advise mothers about breastfeeding. [[Lactation consultant]]s in hospitals or private practice, and volunteer organizations of breastfeeding mothers such as [[La Leche League International]] also provide advice and support.

===Early breastfeeding===
In the half hour after birth, the baby's suckling reflex is strongest, and the baby is more alert, so it is the ideal time to start breastfeeding.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0378-3782(90)90114-X |author=Widström AM, Wahlberg V, Matthiesen AS, ''et al.'' |title=Short-term effects of early suckling and touch of the nipple on maternal behaviour |journal=Early Hum.

===Time and place for breastfeeding===
Feeding a baby "on demand" (sometimes referred to as "on cue"), means feeding when the baby shows signs of [[hunger]]. Newborn babies usually express demand for feeding every 1 to 3 hours per 24 hours (resulting in 8-12 times in 24 hours) for the first two to four weeks.<ref name=cpmc>[http://www.cpmc.org/services/pregnancy/information/breastfeeding-frequency.html Breastfeeding Frequency] from California Pacific Medical Center. Retrieved June 2012.</ref>

"Experienced breastfeeding mothers learn that the sucking patterns and needs of babies vary. While some infants' sucking needs are met primarily during feedings, other babies may need additional sucking at the breast soon after a feeding even though they are not really hungry. Babies may also nurse when they are lonely, frightened or in pain."<ref name=Marasco>{{cite journal |author = Marasco L|title=Common breastfeeding myths |url=http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVAprMay98p21.html |date=1998 Apr-May|journal=Leaven |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=21–24 |accessdate=2009-09-21}}</ref>

"Comforting and meeting sucking needs at the breast is nature's original design. Pacifiers (dummies, soothers) are a substitute for the mother when she cannot be available. Other reasons to pacify a baby primarily at the breast include superior oral-facial development, prolonged [[lactational amenorrhea]], avoidance of nipple confusion, and stimulation of an adequate milk supply to ensure higher rates of breastfeeding success."<ref name=Marasco/>

[[File:HRBassinet.JPG|thumb|rith|Rooming-in bassinet]]

Most US states now have laws that allow a mother to breastfeed her baby anywhere she is allowed to be. In hospitals, [[wikt:rooming-in care|rooming-in care]] permits the baby to stay with the mother and improves the ease of breastfeeding. Some commercial establishments provide breastfeeding rooms, although laws generally specify that mothers may breastfeed anywhere, without requiring them to go to a special area.

===Latching on, feeding, and positioning===
Correct positioning and technique for latching on are necessary to prevent nipple soreness and allow the baby to obtain enough milk.<ref name=SearsBF>{{cite web |url=http://www.askdrsears.com/html/2/T021000.asp |title=Proper positioning and latch-on skills |accessdate=2008-09-24 |publisher=AskDrSears.com |year=2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Staff |first=Healthwise. |title=Breast-feeding: Learning how to nurse |url=http://healthlinksbc.org/kb/content/actionset/ue5284.html |accessdate=2009-06-17 }}</ref> The "rooting reflex" is the baby's natural tendency to turn towards the breast with the mouth open wide; mothers sometimes make use of this by gently stroking the baby's cheek or lips with their nipple to induce the baby to move into position for a breastfeeding session, then quickly moving the baby onto the breast while its mouth is wide open.<ref name=naturalbirth>[http://www.naturalbirthandbabycare.com/latch-on.html Natural Birth and Baby Care.com]</ref> To prevent nipple soreness and allow the baby to get enough milk, a large part of the breast and areola need to enter the baby's mouth.<ref name=SearsBF/><ref name="CHSD">{{cite web | title = Breastfeeding Guidelines | publisher = Rady Children's Hospital San Diego | url = http://www.chsd.org/1438.cfm | accessdate = 2007-03-04 }}</ref> Failure to latch on is one of the main reasons for ineffective feeding and can lead to infant health concerns.

===Duration of each session===
During the newborn period, most breastfeeding sessions will take from 20 to 45 minutes.<ref name=cpmc/> After the finishing of a breast, the mother may offer the other breast.

===Exclusive breastfeeding===
[[File:Human Breastmilk - Foremilk and Hindmilk.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Two 25ml samples of human breast milk. The sample on the left is foremilk, the watery milk coming from a full breast.

Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as "an infant's consumption of human milk with no supplementation of any type (no water, no juice, no nonhuman milk, and no foods) except for vitamins, minerals, and medications."<ref name=Gartner_2005/> National and international guidelines recommend that all infants be breastfed exclusively for the first six months of life. Breastfeeding may continue with the addition of appropriate foods, for two years or more. Exclusive breastfeeding has dramatically reduced infant deaths in developing countries by reducing [[diarrhea]] and [[infectious disease]]s. It has also been shown to reduce HIV transmission from mother to child, compared to mixed feeding.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00002030-200102160-00011 |author=Coutsoudis A, Pillay K, Kuhn L, Spooner E, Tsai WY, Coovadia HM |title=Method of feeding and transmission of HIV-1 from mothers to children by 15 months of age: prospective cohort study from Durban, South Africa |journal=AIDS |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=379–87 |year=2001 |month=February |pmid=11273218 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0269-9370&volume=15&issue=3&spage=379}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Coovadia HM, Rollins NC, Bland RM, ''et al.'' |title=Mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 infection during exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months of life: an intervention cohort study |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9567 |pages=1107–16 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17398310 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60283-9 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(07)60283-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)01101-0 |author=Coutsoudis A, Pillay K, Spooner E, Kuhn L, Coovadia HM |title=Influence of infant-feeding patterns on early mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 in Durban, South Africa: a prospective cohort study.

The [[La Leche League]] says that their most often asked question is, "How can I tell if my baby is getting enough milk?"  They advise that for the first few days while the baby is receiving mostly colostrum only one or two wet diapers per day is normal.  Once the mother's milk comes in, usually on the third or fourth day, the baby should begin to have 6-8 wet cloth diapers (5-6 wet disposable diapers) per day. In addition, most young babies will have at least two to five bowel movements every 24 hours for the first several months.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.lalecheleague.org/faq/enough.html LLLI | How can I tell if my baby is getting enough milk?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The La Leache League gives the following additional signs that indicate a baby is receiving enough milk:

*''The baby nurses frequently averaging at least 8-12 feedings per 24-hour period.
*''The baby is allowed to determine the length of the feeding, which may be 10 to 20 minutes per breast or longer.
*''Baby's swallowing sounds are audible as he is breastfeeding.
*''The baby should gain at least 4-7 ounces per week after the fourth day of life.
*''The baby will be alert and active, appear healthy, have good color, firm skin, and will be growing in length and head circumference.''<ref name=autogenerated2 />

===Expressing breast milk===
[[File:Manual Breast Pump 2005 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|right|Manual breast pump]]

When direct breastfeeding is not possible, a mother can ''express'' (artificially remove and store) her milk. With manual massage or by using a [[breast pump]], a woman can express her milk and store it. It can be stored in freezer storage bags and containers made specifically for breastmilk, a [[supplemental nursing system]], or a [[baby bottle|bottle]] ready for use. Breast milk may be kept at [[room temperature]] for up to six hours, refrigerated for up to eight days or frozen for up to six to twelve months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.llli.org/faq/milkstorage.html|title=What are the LLLI guidelines for storing my pumped milk?}}</ref> Research suggests that the antioxidant activity in expressed breast milk decreases over time but it still remains at higher levels than in infant formula.<ref name ="Hanna_2004">{{cite journal | author = Hanna N | coauthor = Ahmed K, Anwar N, Petrova A, M Hiatt M, Hegyi T | title = Effect of storage on breast milk antioxidant activity | journal = Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed | volume = 89 | issue = 6 | pages = F518–20 | publisher = BMJ Publishing Group Ltd |month=November | year=2004 | doi = 10.1136/adc.2004.049247 | pmid = 15499145 | pmc = 1721790}}</ref>

Expressing breast milk can maintain a mother's milk supply when she and her child are apart. If a sick baby is unable to feed, expressed milk can be fed through a [[nasogastric tube]].

Expressed milk can also be used when a mother is having trouble breastfeeding.

"Exclusively expressing", "exclusively pumping", and "EPing" are terms for a mother who feeds her baby exclusively her breastmilk while not physically breastfeeding. This may arise because her baby is unable or unwilling to latch on to the breast. With good pumping habits, particularly in the first 12 weeks when the milk supply is being established, it is possible to produce enough milk to feed the baby for as long as the mother wishes.

It is generally advised to delay using a bottle to feed expressed breast milk until the baby is 4–6 weeks old and is good at sucking directly from the breast.<ref name="Eisenberg_1989">{{cite book | author = Arlene Eisenberg | title = What to Expect the First Year | publisher = Workman Publishing Company |year=1989 | isbn = 0-89480-577-0}}</ref> As sucking from a bottle takes less effort, babies can lose their desire to suck from the breast. This is called ''nursing strike'' or ''nipple confusion''. To avoid this when feeding expressed breast milk (EBM) before 4–6 weeks of age, it is recommended that breast milk be given by other means such as feeding spoons or feeding cups. Also, EBM should be given by someone other than the breastfeeding mother (or wet nurse), so that the baby can learn to associate direct feeding with the mother (or wet nurse) and associate bottle feeding with other people.

With the improvements in breast pumps, many women are able to return to work while exclusively feeding their infants breast milk because of their ability to express milk at work. Women can also leave their infants in the care of others for vacation or other extended trips, while maintaining a supply of breast milk. This can be very convenient to the mother.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sears|first=Dr. W|title=Ask Dr. Sears: Leaving Baby for Vacation|url=http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-leaving-baby-for-vacation}}</ref>

Some women donate their expressed breast milk (EBM) to others, either directly or through a [[Human milk banking in North America|milk bank]]. Though historically the use of [[wet nurse]]s was common, some women dislike the idea of feeding their own child with another woman's milk; others appreciate being able to give their baby the benefits of breast milk. Feeding expressed breast milk&mdash;either from donors or the baby's own mother&mdash;is the feeding method of choice for premature babies.<ref name="Spatz_2006">{{cite journal |author=Spatz D |title=State of the science: use of human milk and breast-feeding for vulnerable infants |journal=J Perinat Neonatal Nurs |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=51–5 |year=2006 |pmid=16508463}}</ref> The transmission of some [[viral disease]]s through breastfeeding can be prevented by expressing breast milk and subjecting it to Holder [[pasteurisation]].<ref name="pmid11847831">{{cite journal |author=Tully DB, Jones F, Tully MR |title=Donor milk: what's in it and what's not |journal=J Hum Lact |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=152–5 |year=2001 |pmid=11847831 |doi= 10.1177/089033440101700212|url=http://jhl.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11847831}}</ref>

===Mixed feeding===
[[File:Infant with baby bottle.jpg|right|thumb|Expressed breast milk (EBM) or infant formula can be fed to an infant by bottle]]
Predominant or mixed breastfeeding means feeding breast milk along with infant formula, baby food and even water, depending on the age of the child. Babies feed differently with artificial nipples than from a breast. With the breast, the infant's tongue massages the milk out rather than sucking, and the nipple does not go as far into the mouth; with an artificial nipple, an infant must suck harder and the milk may come in more rapidly. Therefore, mixing breastfeeding and bottle-feeding (or using a pacifier) before the baby is used to feeding from its mother can result in the infant preferring the bottle to the breast.  Some mothers supplement feed with a small syringe or flexible cup to reduce the risk of artificial nipple preference.<ref>[http://rehydrate.org/breastfeed/ Breast Milk, Breastmilk, Breastfeeding, Breast Feeding - Rehydration Project<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Tandem nursing===
[[File:Lactancia en tandem 1.jpg|thumb|Tandem nursing]]
Feeding two children at the same time who are not twins or multiples is called ''tandem nursing''. As the appetite and feeding habits of each baby may not be the same, this could mean feeding each according to their own individual needs and can also include breastfeeding them together, one on each breast.

In cases of [[multiple birth|triplets or more]], it is a challenge for a mother to organize feeding around the appetites of all the babies. Breasts can respond to the demand and produce large quantities of milk; mothers have been able to breastfeed triplets successfully.<ref name="Grunberg_1992">{{cite journal | author = Grunberg R | title = Breastfeeding multiples: Breastfeeding triplets | journal = New Beginnings | year = 1992 | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 135–6 | url= http://www.lalecheleague.org/NB/NBSepOct92p135.html }}</ref><ref name=ABA>Australian Breastfeeding Association: [http://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/bfinfo/higher.html Breastfeeding triplets, quads and higher]</ref><ref name="Brown,S">Association of Radical Midwives: [http://www.radmid.demon.co.uk/tripletsbf.htm Breastfeeding triplets]</ref>

Tandem nursing occurs when a woman has a baby while breastfeeding an older child. During the late stages of pregnancy, the milk will change to [[colostrum]], and some older nurslings will continue to feed even with this change, while others may wean due to the change in taste or drop in supply. Breastfeeding a child while being pregnant with another can also be considered a form of tandem feeding for the nursing mother, as she also provides the nutrition for two.<ref name="Flower_2003">{{cite book | author = Flower H | title = Adventures in Tandem Nursing: Breastfeeding During Pregnancy and Beyond | publisher = La Leche League International | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-912500-97-3}}</ref>

The [[World Health Organization]] recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the baby's first 6 months of life, and continued breastfeeding complemented with appropriate foods up to two years old and beyond.<ref name=WHO2003/><ref name="who.int">[http://www.who.int/topics/breastfeeding/en/ WHO | Breastfeeding<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> According to a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the results of which were published in the journal ''Pediatrics'', as of 2013 in the United States reliance on out-dated recommendations and considerations of convenience and cost sometimes resulted in inappropriate earlier attempts to switch to solid food.<ref name=NYT032413>{{cite news|title=Infants Are Fed Solid Food Too Soon, C.D.C.

In many Western countries, however, breastfeeding beyond the age of 1 year old is considered "extended breastfeeding".  

These movements in the West towards earlier weaning, however, are recent.  Breastfeeding beyond the age of 1 year old was at one time a very common practice worldwide.<ref name=Baldwin>{{cite journal |author=Baldwin, Elizabeth N. |title=Extended Breastfeeding and the Law |journal=Breastfeeding Abstracts |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=19–20 |year=2001 }}</ref> Dr. Martin Stein wrote in Parental Concerns about Extended Breastfeeding in a Toddler that "The discussion about extended nursing is similar to that of co-sleeping. They are both characteristics of child rearing that are closely linked to time and place. In most cultures before the 20th century, both practices were the norm. Changes in social, economic, and sexual expectations altered our views of the meaning of breastfeeding and bed sharing." Extended breastfeeding was encouraged in Ancient Greek, Hebrew, and Muslim cultures. The Koran, the Talmud, and the writings of Aristotle all recommend breastfeeding for 2 to 3 years.<ref name=Stein>{{cite journal |author=Stein, Martin T., Eyla G. Boies, Snyder, David M. |title=Parental Concerns About Extended Breastfeeding in a Toddler |journal=Pediatrics |volume=114 |pages=1506–9 |year=2004 }}</ref>  In Breastfeeding Beyond 6 Months: Mothers' Perceptions of the Negative and Positive Consequences, Dr. S. B. Reamer states that "Over the past 100 years of American history, the acceptance of unrestricted nursing decreased and the age acceptable for weaning dropped dramatically, until the average weaning age was 3 months in the 1970s."

In reaction to the move in the West towards earlier weaning, several organizations have been founded in Western countries to support mothers who practice extended breastfeeding. These organizations include the [[International Childbirth Education Association]] and [[La Leche League International]].<ref name=Reamer>{{cite journal |author=Reamer, S.

The US CDC recommends exclusive breastfeeding till six months of age.  Their latest figures (2008) show that 76.9% US women had ever breastfed but only 47.2% were still breastfeeding at six months and 25.5% at twelve months.  Figures for exclusive breastfeeding at three months were 36% and at six months only 16.3%.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/reportcard2.htm Breastfeeding: Data: Report Card 2012: Outcome Indicators | DNPAO | CDC<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Diet during breastfeeding===
Women who are breastfeeding need to be careful about what they eat and drink, since things can be passed to the baby through the breast milk. Just like during pregnancy, breastfeeding women should avoid fish that are high in mercury, and limit lower mercury fish intake.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Myers |first1=GJ |year=2009 |title=Postnatal exposure to methyl mercury from fish consumption: a review and new data from the Seychelles Child Development Study |journal=Neurotoxicology |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=338–49 |pmid= 19442817 |doi=10.1016/j.neuro.2009.01.005 |last2=Thurston |first2=Sally W. |last3=Pearson |first3=Alexander T. |last4=Davidson |first4=Philip W. |last5=Cox |first5=Christopher |last6=Shamlaye |first6=Conrad F. |last7=Cernichiari |first7=Elsa |last8=Clarkson |first8=Thomas W. |pmc=2743883}}</ref> If a woman ingests alcohol, a small amount can be passed to the baby through breast milk.

===Healthy infant growth===
The average breastfed baby doubles its birth weight in 5–6 months. By one year, a typical breastfed baby will weigh about 2½ times its birth weight. At one year, breastfed babies tend to be leaner than formula fed babies, which is healthier, especially in the long-run.  A general guide to the growth of breastfed babies is the following:
*Weight gain of 4–7 ounces (112–200&nbsp;grams) a week during the first month
*An average of 1–2 pounds (1/2 to 1 kilogram) per month for the first six months
*An average of one pound (1/2 kilogram) per month from six months to one year
*Babies usually grow in length by about an inch a month (2.5&nbsp;cm) during the first six months, and around one-half inch a month from six months to one year.<ref name="Sears">{{cite web | title = Weight gain (growth patterns) | publisher = AskDrSears.com | url = http://www.askdrsears.com/topics/breastfeeding/faqs/how-much-weight-will-my-breastfeeding-baby-gain | accessdate = 2007-04-03 }}</ref>

===Weaning===
[[Weaning]] is the process of introducing the infant to other food and reducing the supply of breast milk. The infant is fully weaned when it no longer receives any breast milk. Most mammals stop producing the [[enzyme]] [[lactase]] at the end of weaning, and become [[lactose intolerant]]. Humans often have a mutation, with frequency depending primarily on ethnic background, that allows the production of lactase throughout life so they can drink milk — usually cow or goat milk — well beyond infancy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Swagerty DL, Walling AD, Klein RM |title=Lactose intolerance |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=65 |issue=9 |pages=1845–50 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=12018807 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20020501/1845.html}}</ref> In humans, the psychological factors involved in the weaning process are crucial for both mother and infant as issues of closeness and separation are very prominent during this stage.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00754179708254541 |author=Daws, Dilys |title=The perils of intimacy: Closeness and distance in feeding and weaning |journal=Journal of Child Psychotherapy |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=179–199 |date=August 1997 }}</ref> 

In the past [[bromocriptine]] was in some countries frequently used to reduce the [[Breast engorgement|engorgement]] experienced by many women during weaning. This is now done only in exceptional cases as it causes frequent side effects, offers very little advantage over non-medical management and the possibility of serious side effects can not be ruled out.<ref>{{cite web |author=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |title=FDA moves to end use of bromocriptine for postpartum breast engorgement |url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/ANS00594.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071223043815/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/ANS00594.html |date=1994-08-17 |archivedate=2007-12-23 |accessdate=2009-09-22}}</ref> Other medications such as [[cabergoline]], [[lisuride]] or birth control pills may occasionally be used as lactation suppressants.

===Extended breastfeeding===

====North America====
[[File:Percentage of any and exclusive breastfeeding months since birth among US infants born in 2008.png|thumb|Percentage of any and exclusive breastfeeding months since birth among US infants born in 2008]]
Elizabeth Baldwin says in ''Extended Breastfeeding and the Law'', "Because our culture tends to view the breast as sexual, it can be hard for people to realize that breastfeeding is the natural way to nurture children."<ref>[https://www.llli.org/law/lawextended.html LLLI | Extended Breastfeeding and the Law<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In Western countries such as [[The United States of America]], [[Canada]], and [[Great Britain]], extended breastfeeding is a taboo act. It is difficult to obtain accurate information and statistics about extended breastfeeding in these countries because of the mother's embarrassment.<ref name=Reamer /> Mothers who nurse longer than the social norm sometimes hide their practices from all but very close family members and friends. This is called "closet nursing".<ref name=Reamer /> In a study published by the Journal of Tropical Pediatrics, 24% of American and Canadian mothers nursing past 6 months felt social hostility towards them. This number grew to 42% when mothers were nursing after 1 year of age. Also, 10% of mothers claimed embarrassment when more mobile, verbal toddlers made known in public the fact that they were nursed.<ref name=Reamer />

In the [[United States]], breastfeeding beyond 1 year of age is considered '''extended breastfeeding'', and in contrast to WHO recommendations, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] stated in 1997 that, "Breastfeeding should be continued for at least the first year of life and beyond for as long as mutually desired by mother and child".<ref name=Gartner_2005/><ref name=Stein />

In the United States overall, according to a 2010 CDC "report card", 43% of babies are breastfed until 6 months and 22.4% are breastfed until 12 months, though breastfeeding rates varied among the states.<ref name=CDC2>{{cite web | title=Breastfeeding: Data: Report Card 2010| work=U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention| url=http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/reportcard2.htm | accessdate=2011-03-08}}</ref>

Breastfeeding rates in the U.S. at 6 months rose from 34.2% in 2000 to 43.5% in 2006 and the rates at 12 months rose from 15.7% in 2000 to 22.7% in 2006. The U.S. Healthy People 2010 goals were to have at least 60% of babies exclusively breastfed at 3 months and 25% of babies exclusively breastfed at 6 months so this goal has yet to be met.<ref name=HP2010>{{cite web | title=Healthy People 2010 : Maternal, Infant, and Child Health| work=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services| url=http://www.healthypeople.gov/2010/Data/midcourse/html/focusareas/FA16TOC.htm| accessdate=2011-03-08}}</ref>

In the United States a study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 75 percent of mothers began breastfeeding. However, by 6 months, the rate fell to 43% and was just 22% after a year. Breastfeeding rates vary across the country, from nearly 90 percent initiating breastfeeding in Utah to 52.5 percent in Mississippi. The health care law now requires large employers to provide breastfeeding mothers with breaks and a private space to feed their babies.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/health/research/28childbirth.html "Childbirth: Breast-Feeding Ends by 6 Months for Many"] article by Roni Caryn Rabin in ''[[The New York Times]]'' September 27, 2010, accessed September 28, 2010</ref>

There have been several cases in the [[United States]] where children have been taken away from their mother's care because [[United States|American]] courts or government agencies found the mother's extended breastfeeding to be inappropriate.
In 1992, a [[New York State]] mother lost custody of her child for a year. She was still breastfeeding the child at age 3 and had reported experiences of sexual arousal while breastfeeding the child. The authorities took the child from the home in the fear that the mother might sexually abuse the child. Later, the social service agency that took over the case said that there was more to the case than could be released to the press due to confidentiality laws.<ref name=Baldwin /> 
In 2000, an [[Illinois]] child was removed from the mother's care after a judge ruled that the child might suffer emotional damage because of not being weaned. The child was later returned to the mother and the judge vacated the finding of neglect.<ref name=Baldwin /> 
A social service agency in [[Colorado]] removed a 5-year-old child from the mother because she was still breastfeeding, but the court ordered the child returned to its family immediately.<ref name=Baldwin />

====Guinea-Bissau====
In [[Guinea-Bissau]], West Africa,  the average length of breastfeeding is 22.6 months.<ref name=Jakobsen>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ije/25.1.115 |author=Jakobsen, Marianne S., Morten Sodemann, Kåre Mølbak, and Peter Abbey |title=Reason for Termination of Breastfeeding and the Length of Breastfeeding |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=115–21 |year=1996 |pmid=8666478 }}</ref>

====India====
In [[India]], mothers commonly breastfed their children until 2 to 3 years of age. Cows milk is given in combination with breast milk though use of formula has been on the rise.<ref name=Stein />

====The Philippines====
In the [[Philippines]], the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Milk Code require that breastfeeding be encouraged for babies up to the age of 2 years old or beyond. Under the same code, it is prohibited to advertise infant formula or breastmilk substitutes intended for infants and young children 24 months old and below.<ref>http://pcij.org/blog/wp-docs/ao2006-0012.pdf</ref> In practice, however, a 2008 WHO survey found that on average, mothers in the Philippines breastfed their babies until 14 months of age, with breastfeeding extending up to 17 months on average in rural areas. Almost fifty-eight percent of mothers surveyed around the nation were still breastfeeding their babies when the babies were a year old, and 34.2% of mothers were still breastfeeding when their babies were 2 years old.<ref>http://www.who.int/nutrition/databases/infantfeeding/countries/phl.pdf</ref>

In 2012, it was reported that legislation had been introduced which would narrow down the application of the Milk Code (reducing the period recommending against artificial baby foods for babies from 0 to 36 months to 0 to six months only), would lift the restriction on donations of artificial milk products in emergency situations (encouraging mothers who suffer from disabilities to shift to milk substitutes instead of encouraging them to continue breastfeeding assisted by support persons), would change the legally mandated lactation break period for breastfeeding mothers from paid to unpaid status, and would remove the prohibition against milk companies giving away free samples of artificial milk products in the health care system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://opinion.manilastandardtoday.com/2012/06/04/an-alarming-house-bill/|title=An alarming House bill|date=June 4, 2012|author=Rita Linda V.

====Health effects====
Priscilla Colletto stated in ''Beyond Toddlerhood: The Breastfeeding Relationship Continues'', "The adverse health effects of weaning a child before or during toddlerhood are well documented for Third World countries such as [[Guinea-Bissau]], where children who were no longer breastfed at ages 12–35 months had a 3.5 times higher mortality rate than did their peers who continued to breastfeed."<ref name=Colletto>{{cite journal |author=Colletto, Priscilla Young |title=Beyond Toddlerhood: The Breastfeeding Relationship Continues |journal=LEAVEN |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=3–5 |year=1998 }}</ref> Dr. Laurence Grummer-Strawn, widely known in the breastfeeding research and advocacy communities,<ref>[http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/seminar_26Feb2013_DrGrummerStrawn/en/index.html WHO | Dr Laurence Grummer-Strawn<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> observed that breastfeeding is protective against [[diarrheal diseases]] and other infections and that breastfed children aged 12 to 36 months in [[Indonesia]] have much greater mid-arm circumference than children who have been weaned at an early age.  He also noted that the incidence of malnourishment in breastfed Indonesian children is 3–5% less common than generally encountered in early-weened children.  In one study, artificially-fed infants had 2 to 3 times as many episodes of significant illnesses (defined as "otitis media, lower respiratory disease, significant vomiting or diarrhea, and any illness requiring hospital admission").<ref name=Reamer />   In traditional human societies, the lack of nutrients missing in breast milk such as iron, zinc, and [[vitamin b12]] was supplemented through [[premastication]] and feeding of meat to the child.<ref name=Pelto>{{Cite journal |first=Greta |last=Pelto |first2=Yuanyuan |last2=Zhang |last3=Habicht |first3=Jean-Pierre |title=Premastication: the second arm of infant and young child feeding for health and survival?|journal=Journal of Maternal and Child Nutrition |year=2010 |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] Ltd |doi=10.1111/j.1740-8709.2009.00200.x |volume=6 |pages=4 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

====Psychological effects====
In A Time to Wean by Katherine Dettwyler, it states that "Western, industrialized societies can compensate for some (but not all) of the immunological benefits of breastfeeding with antibiotics, vaccines and improved sanitation. But the physical, cognitive, and emotional needs of the young child persist."<ref name=Dettwyler>{{cite journal |author=Dettwyler, Katherine A. |title=A Time to Wean |journal=Breastfeeding Abstracts |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=3–4 |year=1994 }}</ref> Many children who are breast-fed into their toddler years use the milk as a comforting, bonding moment with their mothers.<ref name=Reamer /> In a 1974 survey of 152 mothers, 17% said that the security their toddlers obtained through extended breastfeeding helped them become more independent, 14% said that extended breastfeeding created a strong mother-child bond, and 14.6% said that extended  breastfeeding strengthened their abilities as a mother. Four mothers said that they felt their child was too dependent and one mother considered her child a poor eater.<ref name=Reamer /> Dr. Stein said that "A mother in my practice who breastfed 2 children until 2 years of age explained that she would slow down and give her undivided attention to her child several times each day when breastfeeding. Her children knew that she always had time for those moments each day. This time was also important to the mother for relaxing and unwinding....For many nursing toddlers, the breast comes to serve the same function as a favorite blanket or stuffed animal in providing comfort and a sense of security." One issue with extended breastfeeding is the ability of the mother and the child to separate. Some say that the desire for extended breastfeeding comes from the mother's inability to let go of "her baby".<ref name=Stein /> Baldwin refutes this statement, saying that the child is the one who chooses when they are weaned, as it  is very difficult to force a child to breastfeed.

===International board certified lactation consultants===

International board certified lactation consultants (IBCLCs) are an excellent source of assistance for breastfeeding mothers. IBCLCs are health care professionals certified in lactation management. They work with mothers to solve breastfeeding problems and educate families and health care professionals about the benefits of breastfeeding. Research shows that rates of exclusive breastfeeding and of any breastfeeding are higher among women who have had babies in hospitals with IBCLCs on staff.<ref>http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/calls/breastfeeding/executivesummary.pdf</ref>

===Physiological constraints to breastfeeding===
While breastfeeding is a natural human activity, difficulties and complications are not uncommon. Putting the baby to the breast as soon as possible after the birth helps to avoid many problems, including [[Puerperal mastitis|mastitis]].<ref>[http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Breastfeeding_dealing_with_mastitis?open Breastfeeding - dealing with mastitis | Better Health Channel<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The AAP breastfeeding policy says: "Delay weighing, measuring, bathing, needle-sticks, and eye prophylaxis until after the first feeding is completed."<ref name="Gartner_2005" /> Many breastfeeding difficulties can be resolved with proper hospital procedures, properly trained midwives, doctors and hospital staff, and lactation consultants.<ref name="Newman_2000">{{cite book | author = Newman J | authorlink = Jack Newman (doctor) | coauthors = Pitman T | title = Dr. Jack Newman's guide to breastfeeding | publisher = HarperCollins Publishers |year=2000 | isbn = 0-00-638568-0}}</ref> There are some situations in which breastfeeding may be harmful to the infant, including infection with [[HIV]] and acute poisoning by environmental contaminants such as lead.<ref name=Mead/> The Institute of Medicine has reported that breast surgery, including breast implants or breast reduction surgery, reduces the chances that a woman will have sufficient milk to breast feed.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.breastimplantinfo.org/augment/brstfdg122000.html | title=Breast Surgery Likely to Cause Breastfeeding Problems| publisher=The Implant Information Project of the Nat. Research Center for Women & Families |date=February 2008}}</ref>

===Social-cultural constraints to breastfeeding===

Women often stop breastfeeding because they return to work. Many aren’t provided with paid maternity leave or time and a private place to breastfeed
or express their breast milk. Legislation around maternity leave and policies
that provide time, space, and support for breastfeeding in the workplace could
reduce this barrier. For mothers who work in farming or the informal sector,
family and community support can help them to continue breastfeeding, even
after returning to work. Also many countries need better laws and enforcement
to protect women from persecution or harassment for breastfeeding.<ref name="savethechildren.org"/>

===Barriers to breastfeeding===
The majority of mothers intend to breastfeed when their baby is born.  There are many things that happen that disrupt or intervene in this plan.  Here are just a few of the barriers that women face when attempting to breastfeed.
*Birth procedures – routine separation of the baby from the mother, delayed breastfeeding initiation, vigorous routine suctioning, medications and mode of delivery all interfere with breastfeeding. A "substantial" number of hospital and facilities implemented procedures and policies that were not evidenced based and that were known to interfere with lactation.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) |title=Breastfeeding-related maternity practices at hospitals and birth centers—United States, 2007 |journal=MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. |volume=57 |issue=23 |pages=621–5 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18551096 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5723a1.htm}}</ref>
*Nursery policies – additional separation, rooming in policies, routine bottles and pacifiers can also prevent the baby from learning to latch and establishing a supply. About a quarter of all breastfeeding infants receive formula supplementation in the first two days of life.<ref>Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General. Call to Action: Support Breastfeeding. Accessed January 20, 2011 from http://surgeongeneral.gov/topics/breastfeeding/calltoactiontosupportbreastfeeding.pdf</ref>
*Ignorance
**Personal – breastfeeding is the biologic norm but in absence of watching others nurse their babies, it is a lost art as well.  Classes, books and personal counseling (professional or lay) can be beneficial. Some women do not want to breastfeed because they fear that breastfeeding will negatively impact the look of their breasts, although medical evidence attributes the actual causes of breast appearance changes to pregnancy, aging, and smoking habits.  Jae Ireland reports that “the idea that breastfeeding causes saggier, smaller breasts is a myth, as proven by a 2008 study published in the ''Aesthetic Surgery Journal.''  The study found that while breastfeeding had no effect on a woman's breasts, other factors did contribute to sagginess, such as a mother's advanced age, her number of pregnancies and whether or not she smoked. All three factors can result in altered breasts, but breastfeeding was not identified as a marker for a change in overall breast appearance.” <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/496659-will-my-breasts-be-ruined-after-breastfeeding/#ixzz2J73k55Hy |title=Will My Breasts Be Ruined After Breastfeeding? |author=Ireland, Jae |work=''LiveStrong.com'' |date=20 July 2011|accessdate=27 Jan 2013}}</ref>
**Partner – Partners also lack basic breastfeeding knowledge and are typically unsure of their role in breastfeeding.
**Practitioner – Physicians and nurses have surprisingly little training in lactation and lactation support.  One of the main action items in the Surgeon General’s Call to Action for Breastfeeding is to help educate practitioners about breastfeeding and breastfeeding issues.<ref>Benjamin, RM (2011). U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding. Washington, DC: U.S.</ref>
*Workforce – Returning to work is the most common cited reason for discontinuing breastfeeding.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Galson|first=Steven K|title=Mothers and children benefit from breastfeeding|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|year=2008|month=July|volume=108|issue=7|pages=1106|pmid=18589012|url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/breastfeeding/SG_081508.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2012|doi=10.1016/j.jada.2008.04.028}}</ref> Maternity leave in the US varies widely despite the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which provides most working mothers up to 12 weeks.  Many mothers are forced to take unpaid time off from their job and the majority do not use FMLA for the full twelve weeks.  Fathers are also allowed to use FMLA for the birth or adoption of the child. Maternity leave varies widely by state.
*Poor latch - Pain caused from mis-positioning the baby on the breast or a tongue-tie in the infant can cause great pain in the mother and therefore discourage her from breastfeeding. These problems are generally easy to correct (by re-positioning or clipping the tongue-tie).<ref>[http://www.bfmed.org/Resources/Download.aspx?filename=Protocol_11.pdf Guidelines for the evaluation and management of neonatal ankyloglossia and its complications in the breastfeeding dyad]; The Academy Of Breastfeeding Medicine; August 3, 2004</ref>  Women whose [[unintended pregnancy|pregnancies are unintended]] are less likely to breast feed their babies.<ref name=HP2020FP>{{cite web | title = Family Planning - Healthy People 2020 | url = http://healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=13 | accessdate = 2011-08-18}}</ref>

===Sociological factors===
[[File:Debret37.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright=1.3|''Famille d’un Chef Camacan se préparant pour une Fête'' ("Family of a Camacan chief preparing for a celebration") by [[Jean-Baptiste Debret]] shows a woman breastfeeding a child in the background.]]
Researchers have found several social factors that correlate with differences in initiation, frequency, and duration of breastfeeding practices of mothers. Race, ethnic differences and socioeconomic status and other factors have been shown to affect a mother's choice whether or not to breastfeed, and how long she breastfeeds her child.  A recent study found that on average women that breastfed their infants  had
higher levels of education, were older, and were more likely to be white.<ref name="surgeongeneral.gov">http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/calls/breastfeeding/calltoactiontosupportbreastfeeding.pdf</ref>

The reasons for the persistently lower rates of breastfeeding among African American women are not well understood, but employment may play a role. African American women tend to return to work earlier after childbirth than white women, and they are more likely to work in environments that do not support breastfeeding.  Although research has shown that returning to work is associated with early discontinuation of breastfeeding,  a supportive work environment may make a difference in whether mothers are able to continue breastfeeding.<ref name="surgeongeneral.gov"/>

Dee's research found that women and children who qualify for [[Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children|WIC]], Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children were among those who were least likely to initiate breastfeeding. Income level can also contribute to women discontinuing breastfeeding early. More highly educated women are more likely to have access to information regarding difficulties with breastfeeding, allowing them to continue breastfeeding through difficulty rather than weaning early. Women in higher status jobs are more likely to have access to a [[lactation room]] and suffer less social stigma from having to breastfeed or express breastmilk at work. In addition, women who are unable to take an extended leave from work following the birth of their child are less likely to continue breastfeeding when they return to work.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}  Low income women are more likely to have unintended pregnancies,<ref name="surgeongeneral.gov"/> and women whose pregnancies are unintended are less likely to breast feed their babies.<ref name="HP2020FP"/>

===Breastfeeding in public===

[[File:Lactancia bebe aire libre.jpg|thumb|Woman nursing her infant at pro breastfeeding conference in Spain]]

Breastfeeding in public is forbidden in some [[jurisdiction]]s, not addressed by law in others, and a granted legal right in public and the workplace in yet others. Where it is a legal right, some mothers may nevertheless be reluctant to [[breastfeed]],<ref>{{cite journal|url =http://internationalbreastfeedingjournal.com/content/3/1/11|doi=10.1186/1746-4358-3-11| title=Got milk?

There have been incidents of owners of premises, or people present, objecting to or forbidding breastfeeding. In some cases the mothers have left; in others, where a law guaranteeing the right to breastfeed has been broken, there has been legal action. Sometimes a company has apologised after the fact.<ref name="Barsch_2006">{{cite web | last= Barsch | first= Sky |title=Woman alleges she was kicked off Burlington flight for breast-feeding | date=2006-11-14 |publisher=Burlington Free Press | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,229390,00.html | accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref>

In 2006, the editors of US ''BabyTalk'' magazine received many complaints from readers after the cover of the August issue depicted a baby nursing at a bare breast. Even though the model's nipple was not shown, readers&mdash;many of them mothers&mdash;wrote that the image was "gross". In a follow-up poll, one-quarter of 4,000 readers who responded thought the cover was negative. Babytalk editor Susan Kane commented, "There's a huge puritanical streak in Americans." In a 2004 survey conducted by the American Dietetic Association, only 43% of the 3,719 respondents believed women ought to have the right to breast-feed in public.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eyeful of breast-feeding mom sparks outrage|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14065706/ns/health-womens_health/t/eyeful-breast-feeding-mom-sparks-outrage/|accessdate=25 November 2011|date=2006-07-27|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>

===Role of marketing===
Controversy has arisen over the marketing of [[breast milk]] vs. [[Infant formula|formula]]; particularly how it affects the education of mothers in [[Third world|third world countries]] and their comprehension (or lack thereof) of the health benefits of breastfeeding.<ref>[http://www.infactcanada.ca/Nestle_Boycott.htm] ''Infant Feeding Action Coalition Canada''</ref> The most famous example being the [[Nestlé boycott]], which arose in the 1970s and continues to be supported by high-profile stars and international groups to this day.<ref name="Moorhead_2007">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/medicine/story/0,,2079757,00.html Milking it] Joanna Moorhead, The Guardian, May 15, 2007</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Writers boycott literary festival| publisher = BBC News| date = 27 May 2002| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2010324.stm| accessdate = 2007-06-07}}</ref>

In 1981, the [[World Health Assembly]] (WHA) adopted Resolution WHA34.22 which includes the [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes]].

==Breastfeeding with HIV infection==

The central concern about breastfeeding with HIV is whether or not it places the child at risk of becoming infected. Varying factors, such as the viral load in the mother’s milk, contribute to the difficulty in creating breastfeeding recommendations for HIV-positive mothers<ref>{{cite book | author = Moland, K, Blystad A | year = 2008 | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 449 | chapter = Counting on Mother’s Love: The Global Politics of Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV in Eastern Africa | title = Anthropology and Public Health: Bridging Differences in Culture and Society|editor= Hahn R, Inhorn M}}</ref> It is also possible for the infant to be infected with HIV throughout the duration of the pregnancy or during the birthing process (intrapartum).<ref name="White, E. 1999 12">{{cite book | author = White, E. | year = 1999 | title = Breastfeeding and HIV/AIDS: The Research, the Politics, the Women’s Perspectives | publisher = McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers | page = 12}}</ref> Breastfeeding with HIV guidelines established by the [[WHO]] suggest that HIV-infected mothers (particularly those in resource-poor countries) practice exclusive breastfeeding only, rather than mixed breastfeeding practices that involve other dietary supplements or fluids.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Moland K, De Paoli M, Sellen D, Van Esterik P, Leshbari S, Blystad A | year = 2010 | title = Breastfeeding and HIV: Experiences from a Decade of Prevention of Postnatal HIV Transmission in Sub-Saharan Africa | journal = International Breastfeeding Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | page = 4 | doi = 10.1186/1746-4358-5-10}}</ref> Many studies have revealed the high benefit of exclusive breastfeeding to both mother and child, documenting that exclusive breastfeeding for a period of 6 months significantly reduces transmission, provides the infant with a greater chance of survival in the first year of life, and helps the mother to recover from the negative health effects of birth much more quickly.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Stein Z, Kuhn L | year = 2009 | title = Breast Feeding: A Time to Craft New Policies | journal = Journal of Public Health Policy | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 3–6 | doi = 10.1057/jphp.2009.23}}</ref> However, a recent study conducted by researchers from the [[University of North Carolina School of Medicine]] suggests that women infected with HIV can, in fact, breastfeed without transmitting the virus to their children, because components in breast milk are understood as able to kill the virus.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wahl A, Swanson MD, Nochi T, Olesen R, Denton PW ''et al.'' | year = 2012 | title = Human Breast Milk and Antiretrovirals Dramatically Reduce Oral HIV-1 Transmission in BLT Humanized Mice | url = | journal = PLoS Pathog | volume = 8 | issue = 6| page = e1002732 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002732 | editor1-last = Silvestri | editor1-first = Guido }}</ref> High levels of certain [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s in breast milk (including eicosadienoic, [[arachidonic acid|arachidonic]] and [[gamma-linolenic acid]]s) are associated with a reduced risk of child infection when nursed by HIV-positive mothers.

====Challenges to PMTCT Policy====
The practice of breastfeeding for HIV positive mothers is a highly contested and controversial global public health concern. Programs for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) and other international guidelines offer preventative interventions to address mother to child transmission(MTCT) of HIV in Third World countries.<ref>{{cite book | author = Moland, K, Blystad A | year = 2008 | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 468 | chapter =  Counting on Mother’s Love: The Global Politics of Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV in Eastern Africa | title = Anthropology and Public Health: Bridging Differences in Culture and Society|editor= Hahn R, Inhorn M}}</ref> PMTCT programs provide HIV-positive women with recommendations and services including [[antiretroviral therapy]] (ART), modifications in infant feeding practices (i.e., exclusive breastfeeding or exclusive replacement feeding), and counseling.<ref>{{cite book | author = Moland, K, Blystad A | year = 2008 | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 450 | chapter = Counting on Mother’s Love: The Global Politics of Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV in Eastern Africa | title = Anthropology and Public Health: Bridging Differences in Culture and Society|editor= Hahn R, Inhorn M}}</ref> 

Although prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) programs have been implemented across different regions, their success in resource-constrained settings is still widely debated upon.<ref name=autogenerated5>{{cite journal | author = Baek C, Rutenberg, N | year = 2010 | title = Implementing Programs for the Prevention of Mother-to-Child HIV Transmission in Resource-Constrained Settings: Horizons Studies | journal = Public Health Reports | volume = 125 | issue = 2}}</ref> In 2008, the majority of sub-Saharan Africa as a whole had an estimate of 430,000 HIV infections among children under the age of 15.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> HIV-positive women’s lack of participation and adherence to PMTCT services and infant feeding guidelines has made the success of these policies difficult, despite the knowledge and technology that has been dedicated to them.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> Many women fear knowing their HIV status.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> Generally speaking, HIV-positive mothers lack support, especially from males, thus resulting in their stigmatization and exclusion by members of the community.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> It is because of this that most women end up losing contact with development programs, which end soon after the mother delivers.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> The discontinuation of these programs makes a knowledge and understanding of different feeding options difficult for these mothers, because these programs are not there to present them with the necessary information.<ref name=autogenerated5 />

====Cross-Cultural Experiences of Breastfeeding with HIV ====

Access to available resources for the prevention of MTCT of HIV varies across different cultural regions. “MTCT of HIV has been virtually eliminated in well-resourced settings such as the United States and Europe”.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite journal | author = Baek C, Rutenberg, N | year = 2010 | title = Implementing Programs for the Prevention of Mother-to-Child HIV Transmission in Resource-Constrained Settings: Horizons Studies | journal = Public Health Reports | volume = 125 | issue = 2 | page = 294}}</ref> Available medical and therapeutic resources in developed countries can include drugs for HIV-positive mothers during pregnancy and labour, cesarean delivery to reduce the infant’s exposure to infection; and modifications in infant feeding practices.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> In third world settings, medical resources and technology can be very hard to find and can serve as a financial burden to HIV-positive mothers. HIV-infected mothers refer to counselors for expert knowledge and recommendations on infant feeding and health.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hollen C | title = HIV-Positive Women's Responses to Global Policy in Infant Feeding in Canada | journal = Medical Anthropology Quarterly | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | page = 503}}</ref> Treatment amenities in resource-constrained settings are also available to HIV-positive mothers in the form of [[antiretroviral therapy]] (ART) which is one resource that has contributed to the elimination of MTCT of HIV in first world countries.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> In order to have access to resources, HIV-positive mothers must be able maintain follow up appointments regularly, however, this is problematic in resource-limited settings due to weak infrastructure in health care systems in countries such as India, Tanzania and Nigeria.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> This can also serve as a dilemma for HIV-positive mothers because although limited resources are available to them, financial constraint can prevent women from accessing available treatments. This can influence HIV-positive mother’s decision to rely solely on breastfeeding as a primary feeding option due to financial instability.<ref>{{cite book | author = Krocker L, Beckwith A | year = 2011 | title = Safe Infant Feeding in Lesotho in the Eras of HIV/AIDS | journal = Annals of Anthropology Practice | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | page = 59}}</ref>

Anthropological research demonstrates that in contexts where breastfeeding is essential to infant survival, such as in resource poor settings, PMTCT infant feeding guidelines challenge notions of motherhood and women’s decision making power over infant care, and colour HIV positive mothers’ infant feeding experiences.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Blystad A, Moland K | year = 2011 | title = Technologies of Hope? Motherhood, HIV and Infant Feeding in Eastern Africa | journal = Anthropology & Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 2}}</ref> In eastern Africa, infant mortality is high and breastfeeding is vital for infant survival.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite book | author = Moland, K, Blystad A | year = 2008 | publisher = Oxford University Press | chapter = Counting on Mother’s Love: The Global Politics of Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV in Eastern Africa | title = Anthropology and Public Health: Bridging Differences in Culture and Society|editor= Hahn R, Inhorn M}}</ref> Here, motherhood is defined as the responsibility for ensuring the child’s proper growth and health.<ref name=autogenerated4 /> Breastfeeding is also seen as a cultural practice that helps create a social bond between mother and child.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Van Esterik P| year = 2002 | title = Contemporary Trends in Infant Feeding Research | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 31 | page = INSERT}}</ref> However, there is a disjuncture between PMTCT policy’s infant feeding guideline and what is considered to be good mothering behaviour.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Moland K, De Paoli M, Sellen D, Van Esterik P, Leshbari S, Blystad A | year = 2010 | title = Breastfeeding and HIV: Experiences from a Decade of Prevention of Postnatal HIV Transmission in Sub-Saharan Africa | journal = International Breastfeeding Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | doi = 10.1186/1746-4358-5-10 | pages = 10}}</ref> The PMTCT policy promotes replacement feeding because it is believed to prevent the risk of transmission of HIV. However, adhering to such guidelines are difficult for mothers in resource-limited settings who believe that not breastfeeding one’s child would be harmful to their health and survival, as well as threaten the “development of close bodily and emotional bonds between mother and child”.<ref>{{cite book | author = Moland, K, Blystad A | year = 2008 | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 471 | chapter = Counting on Mother’s Love: The Global Politics of Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV in Eastern Africa | title = Anthropology and Public Health: Bridging Differences in Culture and Society|editor= Hahn R, Inhorn M}}</ref> As such, not breastfeeding, for HIV-positive women, is perceived as failing to be a good mother.<ref name=autogenerated4 /> Thus, PMTCT programs impact HIV-positive women’s agency and decision-making in infant care, as well as challenge their cultural conceptions of good motherhood.

====World Health Organization breastfeeding guideline for HIV-infected mothers====

In an effort to further refine the [[United Nations]] guideline for optimal infant feeding options for [[HIV]]-infected mothers, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) held a three-day convention in Geneva in 2006 to review new evidence that had been established since they last established a guideline in 2000.  Participants included UN agencies, representative from nongovernmental organizations, researchers, infant feeding experts, and WHO headquarters departments.  The convention concluded with the following recommendations: If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable and safe, HIV-infected mothers are recommended to use replacement feeding. Otherwise, exclusive breastfeeding is recommended. At six months, if replacement feeding is still not available, HIV-infected mothers are encouraged to slowly introduce food while continuing breastfeeding.  Those with HIV-infected infants are recommended to continue breastfeeding even after 6 months.<ref>{{cite journal| author=WHO |title=HIV and infant feeding: new evidence and programmatic experience: report of a technical consultation held on behalf of the Inter-agency Task Team (IATT) on prevention of HIV infections in pregnant women, mothers and their infants. Geneva, Switzerland, 25–27 October 2006}}</ref>

In a 2010 update the WHO stated that significant programmatic experience and research evidence regarding HIV and infant feeding had accumulated since WHO's recommendations on infant feeding in the context of HIV were last revised in 2006. In particular, evidence has been reported that [[antiretroviral]] (ARV) interventions to either the HIV-infected mother or HIV-exposed infant can significantly reduce the risk of postnatal transmission of HIV through breastfeeding. This evidence has major implications for how women living with HIV might feed their infants, and how health workers should counsel these mothers. Together, breastfeeding and ARV intervention have the potential to significantly improve infants' chances of surviving while remaining HIV uninfected.

While the 2010 recommendations are generally consistent with the previous guidance, they recognize the important impact of ARVs during the breastfeeding period, and recommend that national authorities in each country decide which infant feeding practice, i.e. breastfeeding with an ARV intervention to reduce transmission or avoidance of all breastfeeding, should be promoted and supported by their Maternal and Child Health services. This differs from the previous recommendations in which health workers were expected to individually counsel all HIV-infected mothers about the various infant feeding options, and it was then for mothers to decide between them.

Where national authorities promote breastfeeding and ARVs, mothers known to be HIV-infected are now recommended to breastfeed their infants until at least 12 months of age. The recommendation that replacement feeding should not be used unless it is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable and safe remains.<ref>[http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/9789241599535/en/ WHO | Guidelines on HIV and infant feeding 2010<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
