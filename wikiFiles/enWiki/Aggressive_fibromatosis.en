'''Aggressive fibromatosis''' is a rare condition marked by the presence of '''desmoid tumors''', which are benign, slow-growing musculoaponeurotic tumors without any [[metastasis|metastatic]] potential. However, aggressive fibromatosis is locally aggressive.  Despite their benign nature, they can damage nearby structures causing organ dysfunction. Most cases are sporadic, but some are associated with [[familial adenomatous polyposis]] (FAP). Approximately 10% of individuals with [[Gardner's syndrome]], a type of FAP with extracolonic features, have desmoid tumors.<ref name="pmid18237870">{{cite journal |author=Nieuwenhuis MH, De Vos Tot Nederveen Cappel W, Botma A, ''et al'' |title=Desmoid tumors in a Dutch cohort of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis |journal=Clin.

Histologically they resemble [[grading (tumors)|low-grade]] [[fibrosarcoma]]s,<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000028902|desmoid}}</ref> but they are very locally aggressive and tend to recur even after complete resection. There is a tendency for recurrence in the setting of prior surgery; in one study, two-thirds of patients with desmoid tumors had a history of prior abdominal surgery.<ref name="pmid8946994">{{cite journal |author=Lynch HT, Fitzgibbons R |title=Surgery, desmoid tumors, and familial adenomatous polyposis: case report and literature review |journal=Am. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=91 |issue=12 |pages=2598–601 |year=1996 |month=December |pmid=8946994 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Risk factors for desmoid disease amongst FAP patients include female gender, a 3' APC mutation, a positive family history and a history of previous abdominal surgery.<ref name="pmid20528895">{{cite journal |author=Sinha A, Clark SK|title=Risk factors predicting desmoid occurrence in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis: a meta-analysis |journal=Colorectal Dis. |pages=no |year=2010|pmid=20528895 |doi=10.1111/j.1463-1318.2010.02345.x |url= |volume=13 |issue=11}}</ref>

==Classification==
Desmoid tumors may be classified as extra-[[human abdomen|abdominal]], [[layers of the abdominal wall|abdominal wall]], or intra-abdominal (the last is more common in patients with FAP). It is thought that the lesions may develop in relation to [[estrogen]] levels or [[physical trauma|trauma]]/[[surgery|operations]]. 

A 3' APC mutation is the most significant risk factor for intra-abdominal desmoid development amongst FAP patients.<ref name="pmid20352275">{{cite journal |author=Sinha A, Clark SK|title=Risk factors predicting intra-abdominal desmoids in familial adenomatous polyposis: a single centre experience |journal=Tech Coloproctol.|volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=141–6 |year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20352275 |doi= 10.1007/s10151-010-0573-4|url=}}</ref> FAP patients presenting with an abdominal wall desmoid pre-operatively are at an increased risk of developing an intra-abdominal desmoid post-operatively.<ref name="pmid20428953">{{cite journal |author=Sinha A, Clark SK|title=Surgical prophylaxis in familial adenomatous polyposis: do pre-existing desmoids outside the abdominal cavity matter? |journal=Fam Cancer |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=407–11 |year=2010|pmid=20428953|doi=10.1007/s10689-010-9342-9 |url=}}</ref>

Desmoid tumours of the breast are rare. Although benign, they can mimic breast cancer
on physical examination, mammography and breast ultrasound and can also be locally invasive. Even
though they occur sporadically, they can also be seen as a part of Gardner's syndrome. A high index of suspicion and a thorough triple examination protocol is necessary to detect rare lesions like a desmoid tumour which can masquerade as breast carcinoma. Desmoid tumour of the breast may present a difﬁculty in the diagnosis especially where imaging studies are not conclusive and suggest a more ominous diagnosis.<ref name="pmid22370045">{{cite journal |author=Rammohan A, Wood JJ|title=Desmoid tumour of the breast as a manifestation of Gardner's syndrome |journal=Int J Surg Case Rep. |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=139–142|year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.ijscr.2012.01.00 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210261212000120}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment may consist of watching and waiting, complete [[surgery|surgical]] removal, [[radiation therapy]], [[antiestrogen]]s and [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDs]], or [[chemotherapy]].

A biopsy is always indicated as the deﬁnitive method to determine nature of the tumour. Management of these lesions is complex, the main problem being the high rates of recurrence. Wide surgical resection with clear margins is the most widely practiced technique with radiation, chemotherapy, or hormonal therapy being used to reduce recurrence rates.<ref name="pmid22370045"/>

Current experimental studies are being done with Gleevec ([[Imatinib]]) for treatment of desmoid tumors, and show promising success rates.
