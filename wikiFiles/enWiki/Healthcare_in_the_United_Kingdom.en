'''Healthcare in the [[United Kingdom]]''' is a [[devolution|devolved matter]], meaning [[England]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] each have their own systems of private and [[publicly funded healthcare]].  Each country having different policies and priorities has resulted in a variety of differences existing between the systems.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7586147.stm 'Huge contrasts' in devolved NHS] BBC News, 28 August 2008</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7149423.stm NHS now four different systems] [[BBC]] 2 January 2008</ref> That said, each country provides public healthcare to all [[British nationality law|UK permanent residents]] that is free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation.  In addition, each also has a private healthcare sector which is considerably smaller than its public equivalent, with provision of private healthcare acquired by means of private health insurance, funded as part of an employer funded healthcare scheme or paid directly by the customer, though provision can be restricted for those with conditions such as [[AIDS]]/[[HIV]].<ref>[http://www.bupa.co.uk/heartbeat/html/not_covered.html BUPA exclusions] bupa.co.uk, accessed 23 February 2009</ref>

Taken together, the [[World Health Organization]], in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth best in [[Europe]] and eighteenth in the world.<ref name="Who2000">{{Cite book  | editor-last = Haden  | editor-first = Angela   | editor2-last = Campanini  | editor2-first = Barbara  | title = The world health report 2000 - Health systems: improving performance  | year = 2000  | place = Geneva, Switzerland  | publisher = World Health Organisation  | url = http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf   | isbn = 92-4-156198-X  | author = World Health Organisation, World Health Staff, }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~wgreene/Statistics/WHO-COMP-Study-30.pdf|title=Measuring overall health system performance for 191 countries|author=World Health Organization|authorlink=World Health Organization|format=PDF|date=|publisher=pages.stern.nyu.edu}}</ref> A more recent report, the [[Commonwealth Fund]] ''Mirror, Mirror on the Wall'' survey of seven [[first world]] healthcare systems, ranked the [[United Kingdom]] as second overall, taking first place in subcategories including effective care and efficiency.<ref>http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/Fund-Reports/2010/Jun/Mirror-Mirror-Update.aspx?page=all</ref> Overall, around 8.4 per cent of the United Kingdom's [[gross domestic product]] is spent on healthcare, which is 0.5% below the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] average and about one percent below the average of the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/4/38980557.pdf |title=OECD Health Data 2009- How Does the United Kingdom Compare |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-04-28}}</ref>

==Healthcare in England==
{{Main|Healthcare in England}}
[[File:NorfolkAndNorwichUniversityHospital(KatyAppleton)Aug2005.jpg|thumb|[[Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital]], a [[National Health Service]] hospital.]]
Most [[healthcare in England]] is provided by the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS), England's [[socialized medicine|publicly funded healthcare system]], which accounts for most of the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]]'s budget (Â£98.6 billion in 2008-9<ref name="budget2008">{{cite web | author=HM Treasury| title=Budget 2008, Chapter C |date=2008-03-24 | url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/7/3/bud08_chapterc.pdf| accessdate = 2008-03-24 | page=23}}</ref>). The actual delivery of health care services is managed by ten [[NHS strategic health authority|Strategic Health Authorities]] and, below this, locally accountable trusts and other bodies.<ref name="structure">[http://www.rcgp.org.uk/pdf/ISS_INFO_08_NOV04.pdf THE STRUCTURE OF THE NHS] Royal College of General Practitioners</ref> Social care services are a shared responsibility with the local NHS and the local government Directors of Social Services under the guidance of the DH. From the birth of the NHS in 1948, private healthcare has continued to exist, paid for largely by private insurance. In recent years, despite some evidence that a large proportion of the public oppose such involvement,<ref name="BMA 2007 survey">{{cite web | url=http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/AttachmentsByTitle/PDFnhssystreform2007/$FILE/48751Surveynhsreform.pdf | publisher=[[British Medical Association|BMA]] | date=2007-06-01 | title=Survey of the general public's views on NHS system reform in England}}</ref> the private sector has been used to increase NHS capacity. In addition, there is some relatively minor sector crossover between public and private provision with it possible for some NHS patients to be treated in private healthcare facilities<ref>Private hospital serving NHS patients http://www.spirehealthcare.com/Washington/NHS-Services-at-Spire-Washington-Hospital/</ref> and some NHS facilities let out to the private sector for privately funded treatments or for pre- and  post-operative care.<ref>NHS units offering services to paying private patients http://www.privatehealth.co.uk/private-hospitals/nhs/</ref> However, since private hospitals tend to manage only routine operations and lack a level 3 critical care unit (or [[intensive therapy unit]]), unexpected emergencies may lead to the patient being transferred to an NHS hospital<ref>[http://www.privatehealthadvice.co.uk/what-if-surgery-goes-wrong.html What if surgery goes wrong? Private Health Advice - A reference point on how private healthcare works in the uk].</ref> as very few private hospitals have a level 3 critical care unit (or [[intensive therapy unit]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanthonys.org.uk/Intensive_care/critical_care.html |title=St Anthony's Hospital. One of just a few private hospitals able to handle Level 3 intensive care |publisher=Stanthonys.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-04-28}}</ref> putting the patients at greater risk and costing the NHS money.

The two main kinds of trusts in the NHS, reflecting purchaser/provider roles, are ''commissioning trusts'' such as [[NHS primary care trust|Primary Care Trusts]] which examine local needs and negotiate with providers (that may be public or private entities) to provide health care services to the local population, and ''provider trusts'' which are NHS bodies delivering health care service. They will be involved in agreeing major capital and other health care spending projects in their region.<ref name="structure"/>  Services commissioned include general practice physician services (most of whom are private businesses working under exclusive contract to the NHS), community nursing, local clinics and mental health service. For most people, the majority of health care is delivered in a primary health care setting. Provider trusts are care deliverers, the main examples being the hospital trusts and the ambulance trusts which spend the money allocated to them by the commissioning trusts. Hospitals, as they tend to provide more complex and specialized care, receive the lion's share of NHS funding.<ref>Seconday care consumes more costs than any other part of the spending of PCTS. See Figure A.15: Primary care trust expenditure [http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_100670.pdf Appendix A Financial Data Tables taken from DH Annual Report at http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_100667 ]</ref> The hospital trusts own assets (such as hospitals and the equipment in them) purchased for the nation and held in trust for them.<ref name="structure"/> Commissioning has also been extended to the very lowest level enabling ordinary doctors who identify a need in their community to commission services to meet that need.  Primary care is delivered by a wide range of independent contractors such as GPs, dentists, pharmacists and optometrists and is the first point of contact for most people. Secondary care (sometimes termed acute health care) can be either elective care or emergency care and providers may be in the public or private sector, though the majority of secondary care happens in NHS owned facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/aboutnhs/Pages/NHSstructure.aspx |title=NHS structure |publisher=Nhs.uk |date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2011-04-28}}</ref> There are also (as of 2009) 246 [[Memory clinic]]s in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dementiaweb.org.uk/memory-clinics.php |title=Number of memory clinics UK |publisher=Dementiaweb.org }}</ref>

The [[NHS Constitution for England|NHS Constitution]] covers the rights and obligations of patients and staff, many of which are legally enforceable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/choiceintheNHS/Rightsandpledges/NHSConstitution/Documents/NHS_Constitution_interactive_9Mar09.pdf |title=NHS Constitution - interactive version |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-04-28}}</ref> The NHS has a high level of popular public support within the country: an independent survey conducted in 2004 found that users of the NHS often expressed very high levels satisfaction about their personal experience of the medical services they received: 92% of hospital in-patients, 87% of GP users, 87% of hospital outpatients, and 70% of Accident and Emergency department users.<ref name="NHS 2004 survey">{{cite web | title = NHS 2004 survey| author=IPSOS-Mori| publisher = UK Department of Health | date =  | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/FreedomOfInformation/Freedomofinformationpublicationschemefeedback/Classesofinformation/Communicationsresearch/DH_4129933?IdcService=GET_FILE&dID=16549&Rendition=Web| accessdate = 2009-06-29 }}</ref> However, only 67% of those surveyed agreed with the statement "My local NHS is providing me with a good serviceâ, and only 51% agreed with the statement âThe NHS is providing a good service.<ref name="NHS 2004 survey"/> Satisfaction in successive surveys has noted high satisfaction across all patient groups, especially recent inpatients, and user satisfaction is notably higher than that of the general public. The report found that most highly recalled sources of information on the
NHS are perceived to be the most critical. The national press was seen to be the most critical (64%), followed by local press (54%) and TV or radio (51%) compared to just 13% saying the national press is favourable). The national press was reported as being the least reliable source of information (50% reporting it to be not very or not at all reliable, compared to 36% believing the press was reliable).<ref name="NHS 2004 survey"/> Newspapers were reported as being less favourable and also less reliable than the broadcast media. The most reliable sources of information were considered to be leaflets from GPs and information from friends (both 77% reported as reliable) and medical professionals (75% considered reliable).<ref name="NHS 2004 survey"/>

==Healthcare in Northern Ireland==
{{Main|Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland}}
The majority of healthcare in Northern Ireland is provided by [[Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland]]. Though this organization does not use the term 'National Health Service', it is still sometimes referred to as the 'NHS'.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/903003.stm Hospital warns of 'Third World' NHS] BBC News, 30 August 2000</ref>

==Healthcare in Scotland==
{{Main|Healthcare in Scotland}}
The majority of healthcare in Scotland is provided by [[NHS Scotland]]; Scotland's current national system of publicly funded healthcare was created in 1948 at the same time as those in Northern Ireland and in England and Wales, incorporating and expanding upon services already provided by local and national authorities as well as private and charitable institutions. It remains a separate body from the other public health systems in the United Kingdom although this is often not realised by patients when "cross-border" or emergency care is involved due to the level of co-operation and co-ordination, occasionally becoming apparent in cases where patients are repatriated by the [[Scottish Ambulance Service]] to a hospital in their country of residence once essential treatment has been given but they are not yet fit to travel by non-ambulance transport.

==Healthcare in Wales==
{{Main|Healthcare in Wales}}

The majority of healthcare in Wales is provided by [[NHS Wales]]. This body was originally formed as part of the same [[National Health Service|NHS structure]] for [[England and Wales]] created by the [[National Health Service Act 1946]] but powers over the NHS in Wales came under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969<ref>[http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/page.cfm?pid=11595&orgid=452 Introduction to NHS Wales 1960's] www.wales.nhs.uk</ref> and, in turn, responsibility for NHS Wales was passed to the [[Welsh Assembly]] and the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] under devolution in 1999.

==Comparisons between the public health systems in the United Kingdom==

The overall trend has meant a large improvement in health inside the United Kingdom.]]

===Common features===
Each NHS system uses [[General Practitioner]]s (GPs) to provide primary healthcare and to make referrals to further services as necessary. Hospitals then provide more specialist services, including care for patients with psychiatric illnesses, as well as direct access to [[Accident and Emergency]] (A&E) departments. Pharmacies (other than those within hospitals) are privately owned but have contracts with the relevant health service to supply prescription drugs.

Each public healthcare system also provides free<ref>Since January 2007, the NHS have been able to claim back the cost of treatment, and for ambulance services, for those who have been paid personal injury compensation. {{cite web |title=NHS Injury Cost Recovery scheme |publisher=NHS |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/Financeandplanning/NHSInjuryCostRecovery/index.htm |accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref> ambulance services for emergencies, when patients need the specialist transport only available from ambulance crews or when patients are not fit to travel home by public transport. These services are generally supplemented when necessary by the voluntary ambulance services ([[British Red Cross]], [[St Andrews Ambulance Association]] and [[St John Ambulance]]). In addition, patient transport services by air are provided by the [[Scottish Ambulance Service]] in Scotland and elsewhere by county or regional air ambulance trusts (sometimes operated jointly with local police helicopter services<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wiltshireairambulance.co.uk/aboutus.htm |title=Wiltshire Air Ambulance |publisher=Wiltshire Air Ambulance |date= |accessdate=2011-04-28}}</ref>) throughout England and Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airambulanceassociation.co.uk/ |title=Air Ambulance Association |publisher=Air Ambulance Association |date= |accessdate=2011-04-28}}</ref> In specific emergencies, emergency air transport is also provided by naval, military and air force aircraft of whatever type might be appropriate or available on each occasion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6168878.stm |title=RAF flight 'saved couple's baby' |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-11-21 |accessdate=2011-04-28}}</ref>

Each NHS system also provides dental services through private dental practices and dentists can only charge NHS patients at the set rates for each country. Patients opting to be treated privately do not receive any NHS funding for the treatment. About half of the income of dentists in England comes from work sub-contracted from the NHS,<ref>{{cite news | title = Call for dentists' NHS-work quota | work=BBC News |location=London| date =  3 June 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6711379.stm | accessdate=5 January 2010}}</ref>  however not all dentists choose to do NHS work.

===Differences===

====Advice services====
Each NHS system has its own 24-hour telephone advisory service: England has [[NHS Direct]],<ref>[http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/index.aspx NHS Direct (England)]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref> Wales has [[NHS Direct Wales]]/Galw Iechyd Cymru<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhsdirect.wales.nhs.uk/ |title=NHS Direct Wales/Galw Iechyd Cymru |publisher=Nhsdirect.wales.nhs.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-04-28}}</ref> while Scotland has [[NHS24]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs24.com/ |title=Scotland |publisher=NHS 24 |date= |accessdate=2011-04-28}}</ref>

====Best practice and cost effectiveness====

In England and Wales, the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) sets guidelines for medical practitioners as to how various conditions should be treated and whether or not a particular treatment should be funded. These guidelines are established by panels of medical experts who specialize in the area being reviewed.

In Scotland, the [[Scottish Medicines Consortium]] advises NHS Boards there about all newly licensed medicines and formulations of existing medicines as well as the use of antimicrobiotics but does not assess vaccines, branded generics, non-prescription-only medicines (POMs), blood products and substitutes or diagnostic drugs. Some new drugs are available for prescription more quickly than in the rest of the United Kingdom. At times this has led to complaints.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7179699.stm Call for quicker drug decisions] BBC News, 10 January 2008</ref>

====Cost control====
The [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] reports annually on the summarised consolidated accounts of the [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]], and [[Audit Scotland]] performs the same function for [[NHS Scotland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/nao_reports/07-08/0708129_I.pdf |title=NAO report (HC 129-I 2007-08): Report on the NHS Summarised Accounts 2006-07: Achieving Financial Balance |publisher=Nao.org.uk |date=2007-12-11 |accessdate=2011-04-28}}</ref>

====Parking charges====

Parking charges at hospitals have been abolished in Scotland (except for 3 PFI hospitals)<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/scotland_politics/7593400.stm NHS car parking charges abolished] BBC News, 2 September 2008</ref> but continue to be in place at many hospitals in England, Parking charges have also been abolished in Wales<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7323027.stm</ref>

====Prescription charges====

[[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] no longer have prescription charges. However, in [[England]], a prescription charge of Â£7.85 is payable per item, though patients under 16 years old (19 years if still in full-time education) or over 59 years get prescribed drugs are exempt from paying as are people with certain medical conditions, those on low incomes and those prescribed drugs for contraception.

====Policlinics====
{{main|Policlinics in England}}
[[Polyclinic|Policlinics]] are being trialled in England alone, in [[London]] and other suburban areas.

====Role of private sector in public healthcare====
Whereas the United Kingdom Government is expanding the role of the private sector within the NHS in England,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6932310.stm Private firm to carry out surgery] BBC News, 5 August 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2006/jun/30/health.politics Â£64bn NHS privatisation plan revealed] guardian.co.uk, 30 June 2006</ref> the current Scottish government is actively reducing the role of the private sector within public healthcare in Scotland<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6225328.stm Plans to end private cash for NHS] BBC News, 21 June 2007</ref> and planning legislation to prevent the possibility of private companies running GP practices in future.<ref>[http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.2326550.0.sturgeon_to_end_privatisation_of_gp_practices.php Sturgeon to end privatisation of GP practices] Sunday Herald, 8 June 2008</ref>

====Funding and performance of healthcare since devolution====
In January 2010 the [[Nuffield Trust]] published a comparative study of NHS performance in England and the devolved administrations since [[devolution]], concluding that while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have had higher levels of funding per capita than England, with the latter having fewer doctors, nurses and managers per head of population, the English NHS is making better use of the resources by delivering relatively higher levels of activity, crude productivity of its staff, and lower waiting times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/publications/funding-and-performance-healthcare-systems|title=Funding and Performance of Healthcare Systems in the Four Countries of the UK Before and After Devolution|coauthors=Sheelah Connolly, Gwyn Bevan and Nicholas Mays|date=20 January 2010|publisher=Nuffield Trust|accessdate=26 January 2010}}</ref> However, the Nuffield Trust quickly issued a clarifying statement in which they admitted that the figures they used to make comparisons between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom were inaccurate due to the figure for medical staff in Scotland being overestimated by 27 per cent.<ref>[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2010/01/21082217 Nuffield Trust statement] scotland.gov.uk, 20 January 2010</ref> Using revised figures for medical staffing, Scotland's ranking relative to the other devolved nations on crude productivity for medical staff changes, but there is no change relative to England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/nuffield-trust-statement-nhs-scotland-figures-included-study-uk-health-p|title=Nuffield Trust statement on NHS Scotland figures included in study of UK health performance|publisher=Nuffield Trust|accessdate=27 January 2010}}</ref> The Nuffield Trust study was comprehensively criticised by the BMA which concluded "whilst the paper raises issues which are genuinely worth debating in the context of devolution, these issues do not tell the full story, nor are they unambiguously to the disadvantage of the devolved countries. The emphasis on policies which have been prioritised in England such as maximum waiting times will tend to reflect badly on countries which have prioritised spending increases in other areas including non-health ones.<ref>[http://www.bma.org.uk/images/nuffieldfundingperformance_tcm26-195671.pdf Briefing Note, March 2010] bma.org.uk, accessed 20 March 2010</ref>
