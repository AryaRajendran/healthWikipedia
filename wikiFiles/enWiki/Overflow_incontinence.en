'''Overflow incontinence''' is a form of [[urinary incontinence]], characterized by the involuntary release of [[urine]] from an overly full [[urinary bladder]], often in the absence of any urge to [[Urination|urinate]]. This condition occurs in people who have a [[Bladder outlet obstruction|blockage of the bladder outlet]] ([[benign prostatic hyperplasia]], [[prostate cancer]], or [[Urethral stricture|narrowing of the urethra]]), or when [[Detrusor urinae muscle|the muscle that expels urine from the bladder]] is too weak to empty the bladder normally. Overflow incontinence may also be a [[side effect]] of certain [[Pharmaceutical drug|medications]].

==Causes==
Lesions affecting sacral segments or peripheral autonomic fibres result in atonic bladder with loss of sphincteric coordination. This results in loss of detrusor contraction,difficulty in initiating micturition and overflow incontinence.[[Anticholinergic]] side effects of certain medications (for example, certain [[antipsychotic]]s and [[antidepressant]]s) may cause [[urinary retention]] which may lead to overflow incontinence. [[Alpha-adrenergic agonist]]s may cause urinary retention by stimulating the contraction of the [[urethral sphincter]]. [[Calcium channel blocker]]s may decrease the contractility of the [[smooth muscle tissue]] in the urinary bladder, causing urinary retention with overflow incontinence.<ref name=WebMD>{{cite web|author=Vasavada SP, Carmel ME, Rackley R|title=Urinary incontinence|work=[[Medscape]]|publisher=[[WebMD]]|location=New York|year=2012|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/452289-overview#aw2aab6b2b4|accessdate=2012-07-28}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Overflow incontinence occurs when the patient's bladder is always full so that it frequently leaks urine. Weak bladder muscles, resulting in incomplete emptying of the bladder, or a blocked urethra can cause this type of incontinence. [[Autonomic neuropathy]] from diabetes or other diseases (e.g. [[Multiple sclerosis]]) can decrease neural signals from the bladder (allowing for overfilling) and may also decrease the expulsion of urine by the [[detrusor]] muscle (allowing for urinary retention).  Additionally, tumors and [[kidney stone]]s can block the urethra. Spinal cord injuries or nervous system disorders are additional causes of overflow incontinence. In men, [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH) may also restrict the flow of urine.  Overflow incontinence is rare in women, although sometimes it is caused by fibroid or ovarian tumors. Also overflow incontinence can be from increased outlet resistance from advanced vaginal prolapse causing a "kink" in the urethra or after an anti-incontinence procedure which has overcorrected the problem.<ref name="AMN">{{cite web | Christopher M.

[[Anticholinergic]] medications may worsen overflow incontinence.  Even NSAIDs medications may worsen overflow incontinence.

;Catheterization
If an incontinence is due to overflow incontinence, in which the bladder never empties completely, or if the bladder cannot empty because of poor muscle tone, past surgery, or spinal cord injury, a [[urinary catheterization|catheter]] may be used to empty the bladder. A catheter is a tube that can be inserted through the urethra into the bladder to drain urine. Catheters may be used once in a while or on a constant basis, in which case the tube connects to a bag that is attached to the leg. If a long-term (or indwelling) catheter is used, urinary tract infections may occur.
