The '''Olympic Cool-Cap system''' is a helmet designed to provide [[hypothermia therapy for neonatal encephalopathy]] caused by [[cerebral hypoxia|hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy]] (HIE),<ref name="medgadget">{{cite web|url=http://medgadget.com/archives/2006/12/coolcap_system.html |title=Cool-Cap System Gets FDA Nod |publisher=Medgadget.com |accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref> preventing [[cerebral palsy]] in babies born with little or no oxygen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sw.org/web/patientsAndVisitors/iwcontent/public/childrens_hospital/en_us/html/childrenshospital_coolCapSystem.html |title=Cool-Cap System&nbsp;— Children's Hospital&nbsp;— Scott & White&nbsp;— Central Texas |publisher=Sw.org |accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref>

The device works by a steady flow of water at a selected temperature through a cap covering the infant's head to cool the brain<ref name="medgadget" /> within the first six hours of life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.natus.com/index.cfm?page=products_1&crid=284 |title=Natus Medical Incorporated&nbsp;— Newborn Brain Injury&nbsp;— Cool Cap System |publisher=Natus.com |accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref> By cooling the brain, [[cell metabolism]] is slowed which prevents toxins from injured cells from spreading to other parts of the brain.<ref name="abc">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc15.com/content/news/phoenixmetro/central/story/Miracle-baby-survives-20-minutes-without-oxygen/8aBkItUAEEOrVXn4wRF7yQ.cspx |title=Miracle baby survives 20 minutes without oxygen&nbsp;— Phoenix Arizona news, breaking news, local news, weather radar, traffic from ABC15 News |publisher=ABC15.com |accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref>

==History==

Investigations into [[neonatal]] [[hypoxic-ischemic cerebral injury]] in the period from 2000 to 2006 made it clear that for a group of high risk babies a slight temperature reduction could provide a significant reduction in brain injury.<ref>{{ cite pmid | 11031697 }}</ref><ref>{{ cite pmid | 17062309 }}</ref> By 2007 reviewers found that cooling was a safe and effective intervention.<ref>{{ cite pmid | 17909138  }}</ref> Some doubt remained as to whether it was warranted in cases of asphyxiation, but by 2009 reviewers found that it reduced the occurrence of severe neurological problems.<ref>{{ cite pmid | 19797281 }}</ref>

==Use==

The device was first approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] in late 2006<ref name="medgadget" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108813.htm |title=FDA Approves Novel Device That Prevents or Reduces Brain Damage in Infants |publisher=Fda.gov |accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref> and hailed as "bring[ing] new hope to parents of the approximately 5,000 to 9,000 babies each year who are born in the United States with moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy".<ref name="medgadget" />

It is also used in the United Kingdom, where it treats 1,000 babies per year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/cooling-cure-averts-infant-brain-damage-1795740.html |author=Jeremy Laurance |title=Cooling 'cure' averts infant brain damage |date=2009-10-09 |work=The Independent |location=UK }}</ref>

Cooling is currently the only tool doctors can use to prevent neurological disorders caused by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.<ref name="abc"/>

==Chemotherapy==

Although doubt remains about the effectiveness of the Cool-Cap system on patients undergoing [[chemotherapy]] using [[Epirubicin]] and [[Docetaxel]], studies suggest there is statistically significant, but marginal, decrease in hair loss in study participants.<ref>{{ cite pmid | 12787013 }}</ref>

==Side effects==

In tests, minor [[cardiac arrhythmias]] occurred slightly more often in cooled infants, however the effect was not unexpected because mild [[sinus bradycardia]] is known to be associated with [[hypothermia]]. In tests, all cases were resolved with appropriate therapy.  The Cool-Cap system also increased the incidence of scalp [[edema]]; however, all cases were resolved prior to or after completion of treatment.<ref name="medscape">{{cite web |author=Waknine, Yael |title=FDA Approvals: Olympic Cool-Cap, Spanner Stent, CellSearch System|publisher=MedscapeCME |date=January 3, 2006|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/550202 |accessdate=October 8, 2009 }}</ref>
