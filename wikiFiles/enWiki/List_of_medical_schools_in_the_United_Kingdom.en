[[Image:Batl-chs01.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Charterhouse Square]], home to [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry]].  Medical training has taken place at Barts continuously since its foundation in 1123.  Its college of medicine was formally founded in 1843.  Prior to this date, however, it was already referred to as a "medical school".<ref>The Morning Post (London, England), Tuesday, January 11, 1825; pg. [1]; Issue 16867</ref>]]
There are thirty-two [[Medical school in the United Kingdom|medical schools in the United Kingdom]] that are recognised by the [[General Medical Council]] and from which students can obtain a [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|medical degree]]. There are twenty-four such schools in England, five in Scotland, two in Wales and one in Northern Ireland.  All but [[Warwick Medical School]] and [[Swansea Medical School]] offer undergraduate courses in medicine.  The [[Bute Medical School|Bute Medical School (University of St Andrews)]] and [[Durham Medical School]] offer undergraduate pre-clinical courses only, with students proceeding to another medical school for clinical studies.  Although [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]] offer both pre-clinical and clinical courses in medicine, students who study pre-clinical medicine at one of these universities may move to another university for clinical studies. At other universities students stay at the same university for both pre-clinical and clinical work.

The earliest place of medical training in Britain was Barts Hospital, now part of [[Queen Mary, University of London]], where it has taken place continuously since its foundation in 1123. Medical teaching has taken place at the University of Oxford since at least the 13th century and its first Regius Professor of medicine appointed in 1546.  Medical teaching began at the foundation of [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine]] in 1495, although even as late as 1787 there were calls "for the establishment of a medical school" in Aberdeen.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=FndbAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA117&dq=%22medical+school%22#v=onepage&q=%22medical%20school%22&f=false |title=A complete collection of the papers ... - Marischal College and University |publisher=Google Books |date= |accessdate=2011-10-16|year=1787}}</ref>  The  [[University of St Andrews]] began teaching medicine in the late 15th century.  The [[University of Cambridge]] appointed its first Regius Professor of medicine in 1540 although it is likely teaching occurred well before this date. Teaching began in 1550 at St Thomas' Hospital, London. The [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]] began in 1726 and was the first established medical school in Scotland. [[St George's, University of London]] has its origins in 1733.<ref>[http://www.sgul.ac.uk/about/history.cfm]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> The [[London Hospital Medical College]] (LHMC) was founded in 1785 and is now part of [[Queen Mary, University of London]]'s School of Medicine. Formal medical education began in [[Birmingham Medical School|Birmingham]] in 1767,<ref name="medicine.bham.ac.uk">http://www.medicine.bham.ac.uk/histmed/history.shtml#TheBeginning</ref> and in [[Manchester Medical School|Manchester]] in 1814.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicine.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/history/ |title=History of the School (School of Medicine - University of Manchester) |publisher=Medicine.manchester.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=16 Oct 2011}}</ref> In the early 19th century, medical schools in [[Queen's University Belfast Medical School|Belfast]], [[Sheffield Medical School|Sheffield]], [[Leeds School of Medicine|Leeds]], [[Newcastle University Medical School|Newcastle]], and [[Liverpool Medical School|Liverpool]] were formally established, between 1821 and 1842.

The next expansion of medical schools began following the recommendations of the ''Royal Commission on Medical Education (1965-1968)'' (the ''Todd Report''), which called for the immediate establishment of new schools in [[Southampton Medical School|Southampton]],  [[Leicester Medical School|Leicester]] and [[University of Nottingham Medical School|Nottingham]] to aid [[medical education in the United Kingdom]];<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nhshistory.net/chapter_2.htm#Medical_education_and_staffing | title=Chapter 2, 1958-1967 | accessdate=2007-08-21 | publisher=NHSHistory.net}}</ref><ref>"Commission on Education". ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' 2: 57-58.</ref> all were built between 1970 and 1980.  Medical schools at [[Warwick Medical School|Warwick]] (located in the City of [[Coventry]]), [[Swansea Medical School|Swansea]], [[Keele University Medical School|Keele]] (located in the City of [[Stoke-on-Trent]]) and [[Hull York Medical School|Hull (in partnership with York)]] eventually opened in the 1990s and early 21st century, as well as new medical schools at [[University of East Anglia]] (located in the city of Norwich) [[Durham University School for Health|Durham]], [[Brighton and Sussex Medical School|Brighton and Sussex]], and [[Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry|Plymouth and Exeter]]. [[Buckingham University]], one of only two private universities in England, is launched a graduate entry medical school in 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/medicine/undergrad/ |title=Graduate Entry Medical School: MBBS University of Buckingham |publisher=Buckingham.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-16}}</ref> although it offers only postgraduate MD qualifications to doctors already qualified to MBBS or equivalent and does not offer initial medical training approved by the General Medical Council. The [[University of Central Lancashire]] is expected to submit an application for a private medical school in summer 2013. However, the BMA has expressed concerns that private schools could worsen wider participation in medicine.<ref name = "S BMA News">Student BMA news January 2013, accessed 6 January 2013</ref>
