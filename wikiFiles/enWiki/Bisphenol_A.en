'''Bisphenol A''' ('''BPA''') is an [[organic compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>OH)<sub>2</sub> belonging to the group of [[diphenylmethane]] derivatives and [[bisphenol]]s.

BPA is used to make certain plastics and [[epoxy]] resins; it has been in commercial use since 1957. BPA-based plastic is clear and tough, and is used to make a variety of common consumer goods (such as baby and water bottles, sports equipment, and CDs and DVDs) and for industrial purposes, like lining water pipes. Epoxy resins containing BPA are used as coatings on the inside of many food and beverage cans. It is also used in making [[thermal paper]] such as that used in sales receipts.

It is part of the [[bisphenols]] group of chemical compounds with two hydroxyphenyl functionalities. It is a colorless solid that is soluble in organic solvents, but poorly soluble in water. {{nowrap|Bisphenol A}} has a vapor pressure of {{nowrap|5×10<sup>−6</sup> Pa}}.<ref>[http://www.speclab.com/compound/c80057.htm speclab.com – Chemical Fact Sheet – Cas #80057 CASRN 80-05-7], 1 April 2012</ref>

BPA exhibits hormone-like properties that raise concern about its suitability in consumer products and food containers. Since 2008, several governments have questioned its safety, which prompted some retailers to withdraw [[polycarbonate]] products. A 2010 report from the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) warned of possible hazards to fetuses, infants, and young children.<ref name="U.S. Food and Drug Administration">{{vcite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/UCM197778.pdf|title=Update on Bisphenol A for Use in Food Contact Applications: January 2010 |date=15 January 2010 |publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=15 January 2010}}</ref> In September 2010, Canada became the first country to declare BPA a toxic substance.<ref>{{vcite journal |url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2010/2010-10-13/pdf/g2-14421.pdf |journal=[[Canada Gazette]] Part II |volume=144 |issue=21 |date=13 October 2010 |pages=1806–18 }}</ref><ref>{{vcite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canada-first-to-declare-bisphenol-a-toxic/article1755272/ |title=Canada first to declare bisphenol A toxic |author=Martin Mittelstaedt |work=The Globe and Mail |location=Canada |date=13 October 2010}}</ref> The [[European Union]], Canada, and recently the United States have banned BPA use in baby bottles.<ref name="urlFDA Bans Chemical BPA From Sippy Cups And Baby Bottles">{{cite web | url = http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2012/07/17/156916616/fda-bans-chemical-bpa-in-sippy-cups-and-baby-bottles | title = FDA Bans Chemical BPA From Sippy Cups And Baby Bottles | publisher = NPR | author = Hamilton J | date = 12 July 2012 | work = The Salt: NPR Food Blog }}</ref>

Upon handling, BPA in thermal paper can be transferred to skin, and there is some concern that residues on hands could be ingested through incidental hand-to-mouth contact. Furthermore, some studies suggest that dermal absorption may contribute some small fraction to the overall human exposure. European data indicate that the use of BPA in paper may also contribute to the presence of BPA in the stream of recycled paper and in landfills. Although there are currently no estimates for the amount of BPA used in thermal paper in the United States, in Western Europe, the volume of BPA reported to be used in thermal paper in 2005/2006 was 1,890 tonnes per year, while total production was estimated at 1,150,000 tonnes per year.

More specifically, bisphenol A closely mimics the structure and function of the hormone estradiol with the ability to bind to and activate the same estrogen receptor as the natural hormone.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Beverly S|title=Bisphenol A: An endocrine disruptor with widespread exposure and multiple effects|journal=J.Steroid Biochem.Mol.Bio|year=2011|volume=127|pages=27–34}}</ref><ref>{{vcite book

Overall, empirical evidence supporting the negative health effects of BPA varies significantly across studies.  Opinions vary greatly about the health effects of BPA.  Some studies conclude that BPA poses no health risks while others state that BPA causes a number of adverse health effects.  In general, the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food, the EU's European Chemicals Bureau, the European Food Safety Authority, and the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] have concluded that current levels of BPA present no risk to the general population. However, experts in the field of endocrine disruptors have stated that the entire population may suffer adverse health effects from current BPA levels.<ref name="test">Breonius, A., Rudén, C., Håkansson, H. & Hanberg, A.

A comparative analysis of controversies in the health risk assessment of Bisphenol A"  Reproductive Toxicology 29. 132–146 PMID 19931376</ref> In 2009, [[The Endocrine Society]] released a statement citing the adverse effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and the controversy surrounding BPA.<ref>{{vcite web |url=http://www.endo-society.org/advocacy/policy/upload/Endocrine-Disrupting-Chemicals-Position-Statement.pdf |title=Endocrine Society Position Statement Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals |publisher=Endocrine Society |date=11 June 2009 |accessdate=6 April 2012}}</ref>
In 2012 the FDA did ban the use of BPA in baby bottles, however the [[Environmental Working Group]] called the ban "purely cosmetic".  In a statement they said,"If the agency truly wants to prevent people from being exposed to this toxic chemical associated with a variety of serious and chronic conditions it should ban its use in cans of infant formula, food and beverages." The [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] called the move inadequate, saying the FDA needs to ban BPA from all food packaging.<ref name="commondreams">[http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2012/07/17-4 FDA to Ban BPA from Baby Bottles; Plan Falls Short of Needed Protections: Scientists | Common Dreams<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>   In a statement a FDA spokesman said the agency's action was not based on safety concerns and that "the agency continues to support the safety of BPA for use in products that hold food."<ref name="huffpo">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/17/fda-bans-bpa-baby-bottles_n_1679795.html FDA Bans BPA From Baby Bottles And Sippy Cups<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) also holds the position that BPA is not a health concern.  In 2011, Andrew Wadge, the chief scientist of the United Kingdom's [[Food Standards Agency]], commented on a 2011 US study on dietary exposure of adult humans to BPA,<ref name="Teeguarden">{{cite journal |author=Teeguarden JG, Calafat AM, Ye X, Doerge DR, Churchwell MI, Gunawan R, Graham MK |year=2011 |month=September |title=Twenty-four hour human urine and serum profiles of bisphenol A during high-dietary exposure |journal=Toxicological Sciences |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=48–57 |pmid=21705716}}</ref> saying, "This corroborates other independent studies and adds to the evidence that BPA is rapidly absorbed, detoxified, and eliminated from humans – therefore is not a health concern."<ref>{{vcite web |url=http://blogs.food.gov.uk/science/entry/small_pond_same_big_issues |title=Small pond, same big issues |publisher=[[Food Standards Agency|FSA]] |first=Andrew |last=Wage |date=27 July 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2011 }}</ref> In the 2011 US study 20 subjects were tested for BPA every hour for twenty-four hours while consuming three meals consisting of canned food.<ref name="Teeguarden"/> This study has been criticized, however, as lacking data and having flawed assumptions.<ref name="pmid22020768">{{cite journal | author = Vom Saal FS, Prins GS, Welshons WV | title = Report of very low real-world exposure to bisphenol A is unwarranted based on a lack of data and flawed assumptions | journal = Toxicol.

===Expert panel conclusions===
In 2006, the US Government sponsored an assessment of the scientific literature on BPA.  Thirty-eight experts in fields involved with bisphenol A gathered in Chapel Hill, North Carolina to review several hundred studies on BPA, many conducted by members of the group.  At the end of the meeting, the group issued the Chapel Hill Consensus Statement,<ref name=ChapelHill>vom Saal FS, et al (2007) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2967230/ Chapel Hill bisphenol A expert panel consensus statement: integration of mechanisms, effects in animals and potential to impact human health at current levels of exposure]. Reprod Toxicol 24(2):131-8. Epub 2007 Jul 27.</ref> which stated "BPA at concentrations found in the human body is associated with organizational changes in the prostate, breast, testis, mammary glands, body size, brain structure and chemistry, and behavior of laboratory animals."<ref>Vogel, S.  (2009).  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2774166/ "The Politics of Plastics: The Making and Unmaking of Bisphenol A 'Safety'"].  American Journal of Public Health 99 (S3): 559–566.</ref>

The Chapel Hill Consensus Statement claimed that average levels in people are above those that cause harm to many animals in laboratory experiments. They noted that while BPA is not persistent in the environment or in humans, [[biomonitoring]] surveys indicate that exposure is continuous, which is problematic because acute animal exposure studies are used to estimate daily human exposure to BPA, and no studies that had examined BPA [[pharmacokinetics]] in animal models had followed continuous low-level exposures. They added that measurement of BPA levels in serum and other body fluids suggests the possibilities that BPA intake is much higher than accounted for, and/or that BPA can bioaccumulate in some conditions (such as pregnancy).<ref name=ChapelHill />

A panel convened by the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] in 2007 produced a review of the literature and found that many of the studies referenced by the Chapel Hill group had methodological problems.  Its conclusions, "expressed relative to current estimates of general population exposure levels in the U.S.," were the following: 
<blockquote>1. For pregnant women and fetuses the Expert Panel has different levels of concern for the different 
developmental endpoints that may be susceptible to bisphenol A disruption, as follows:<br> 
• For neural and behavioral effects, the Expert Panel has some concern<br>
• For prostate effects, the Expert Panel has minimal concern <br>
• For the potential effect of accelerated puberty, the Expert Panel has minimal concern<br> 
• For birth defects and malformations, the Expert Panel has negligible concern<br> 
2. For infants and children the Expert Panel has the following levels of concern for biological processes 
that might be altered by Bisphenol A, as follows:<br> 
• some concern for neural and behavioral effects<br> 
• minimal concern for the effect of accelerated puberty<br> 
3. For adults, the Expert Panel has negligible concern for adverse reproductive effects following exposures in the general population to Bisphenol A. For highly exposed subgroups, such as occupationally exposed populations, the level of concern is elevated to minimal.<ref name="CERHR"/>{{rp|352-353}} </blockquote>

A 2008 report by the U.S. [[National Toxicology Program]] (NTP) found "'''some concern''' for effects on the brain, behavior, and prostate gland in fetuses, infants, and children at current human exposures to bisphenol A"; "'''minimal concern''' for effects on the mammary gland and an earlier age for puberty for females in fetuses, infants, and children at current human exposures to bisphenol A", and "'''negligible concern''' that exposure of pregnant women to bisphenol A will result in fetal or neonatal mortality, birth defects, or reduced birth weight and growth in their offspring" and "that exposure to bisphenol A will cause reproductive effects in non-occupationally exposed adults and minimal concern for workers exposed to higher levels in occupational settings."<ref name="NTP08">{{vcite web |url=http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/sya-bpa/ |title=Since you asked – Bisphenol A (BPA): Questions and Answers about Bisphenol A |publisher=National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences |author=John Bucher, PhD, Mike Shelby, PhD |accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref>

===Obesity===
{{main|Obesity}}
[[File:Medical_complications_of_obesity.png|thumb|right|Bisphenol A may increase the risk for obesity.]]

A 2008 review has concluded that obesity may be increased as a function of BPA exposure, which "...merits concern among scientists and public health officials."<ref>{{vcite doi|10.1097/MED.0b013e32830ce95c}}</ref> A 2009 review of available studies has concluded that "Given the potential of BPA to exert [[pleiotropic]] effects, it is likely that early BPA exposure can influence several mechanisms important for body weight regulation, including [[adipocyte]] deposition, [[glucose]] uptake and [[homeostasis]], and the development and maturation of pathways and circuits important for energy homeostasis."<ref name=pmid1943328>{{cite pmid|19433248}}</ref> Another 2009 review has concluded that "Eliminating exposures to (BPA) and improving nutrition during development offer the potential for reducing obesity and associated diseases".<ref>{{vcite doi|10.1016/j.mce.2009.02.025}}</ref> Other reviews have come with similar conclusions.<ref>{{cite pmid|19433252}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|19433244}}</ref>

===Neurological issues===
A panel convened by the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] determined that there was "some concern" about BPA's effects on fetal and infant brain development and behavior.<ref name="CERHR"/> A 2008 report by the U.S. [[National Toxicology Program]] (NTP) later agreed with the panel, expressing "some concern for effects on the brain".<ref name="NTP08"/> In January 2010 the FDA expressed the same level of concern.

A 2007 review has concluded that BPA, like other xenoestrogens, should be considered as a player within the nervous system that can regulate or alter its functions through multiple pathways.<ref>{{cite pmid|17868795}}</ref> A 2007 review has concluded that low doses of BPA during development have persistent effects on brain structure, function and behavior in rats and mice.<ref>{{vcite doi|10.1016/j.reprotox.2007.06.004}}</ref> A 2008 review concluded that low-dose BPA maternal exposure causes long-term consequences at the level of neurobehavioral development in mice.<ref>{{cite pmid|18949834}}</ref> A 2008 review has concluded that neonatal exposure to bisphenol-A (BPA) can affect sexually dimorphic brain morphology and neuronal adult phenotypes in mice.<ref>{{cite pmid|17822772}}</ref> A 2008 review concluded that BPA altered [[long-term potentiation]] in the [[hippocampus]] and even nanomolar (10<sup>-9</sup> [[Mol]])dosage could induce significant effects on memory processes.<ref name="pmid17822775">{{cite pmid|17822775}}</ref>

===Reproductive system and sexual behavior research===

A study released in 2013 demonstrated that BPA in weak concentrations is sufficient to produce a negative reaction on the human testicle. The researchers found that a concentration equal to 2 micrograms per litre of bisphenol A in the culture medium, a concentration equal to the average concentration generally found in the blood, urine and amniotic fluid of the population, was sufficient to produce the effects.  The researchers believe that exposure of pregnant women to bisphenol A may be one of the causes of [[congenital]] [[masculinisation]] defects of the [[hypospadia]] and [[cryptorchidism]] types the frequency of which has doubled overall in the past 40 years.  They also suggested that "it is also possible that bisphenol A contributes to a reduction in the production of sperm and the increase in the incidence of testicular cancer in adults that have been observed in recent decades."<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/01/130122101913.htm Harmful effects of bisphenol A demonstrated experimentally<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In a 2010 study, mice were given BPA at doses thought to be equivalent to levels currently being experienced by humans. The research showed that BPA exposure affects the earliest stages of egg production in the ovaries of the developing mouse fetuses, thus suggesting that the next generation may suffer genetic defects in such biological processes as [[mitosis]] and [[DNA]] replication. In addition, the research team noted that their study "revealed a striking down-regulation of mitotic/cell cycle genes, raising the possibility that BPA exposure immediately before meiotic entry might act to shorten the reproductive lifespan of the female" by reducing the total pool of fetal [[oocytes]].<ref name="pmid20739668">{{vcite journal | author = Lawson C, Gieske M, Murdoch B, Ye P, Li Y, Hassold T, Hunt PA | title = Gene expression in the fetal mouse ovary is altered by exposure to low doses of bisphenol A | journal = Biol.

The changes caused the mice to over-respond to estrogen throughout adulthood, long after the BPA exposure, thus suggesting that early exposure to BPA genetically "programmed" the uterus to be hyper-responsive to estrogen. Extreme estrogen sensitivity can lead to fertility problems, advanced puberty, altered mammary development and reproductive function, as well as a variety of hormone-related cancers.

A 2009 ''in vitro'' study on [[cytotrophoblast]] cells has found [[Cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] effects in exposure of BPA doses from 0.0002 to 0.2&nbsp;µg/ml and concluded this finding "suggests that exposure of placental cells to low doses of BPA may cause detrimental effects, leading ''in vivo'' to adverse pregnancy outcomes such as [[preeclampsia]], intrauterine growth restriction, prematurity and pregnancy loss".<ref>{{vcite doi|10.1016/j.taap.2009.09.005}}</ref>

A 2009 study in rats concluded that BPA, at the reference safe limit for human exposure, was found to impact intestinal permeability and may represent a risk factor in female offspring for developing severe [[Colitis|colonic inflammation]] in adulthood.<ref>{{cite pmid|20018722}}</ref>

====Asthma====

[[Asthma]] rates have shown a dramatic increase since the 1970s; in 2011 the CDC reported the rate of childhood asthma to be about 1 in 10.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/asthma/asthmadata.htm</ref>  Some experts believe that the cause may be related to early-life exposures and changes in immune systems.<ref>http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=new-study-links-bpa-and-childhood-asthma</ref>  Studies with lab mice have found a link between BPA exposure and asthma; a 2010 study on mice has concluded that [[pregnancy#Perinatal period|perinatal]] exposure to 10&nbsp;µg/ml of BPA in drinking water enhances allergic sensitization and bronchial inflammation and responsiveness in an animal model of [[asthma]].<ref>{{cite pmid|20123615}}</ref>

====Studies on humans====

=====Lang study and heart disease=====
The first large study of health effects on humans associated with bisphenol&nbsp;A exposure was published in September 2008 by Iain Lang and colleagues in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]''.<ref name="Lang et al.">{{vcite journal |author=Lang IA, Galloway TS, Scarlett A, Henley WE, Depledge M, Wallace RB, Melzer D |title=Association of Urinary Bisphenol A Concentration With Medical Disorders and Laboratory Abnormalities in Adults |journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] |volume=300 |issue=11 |pages=1303–10 |year=2008 |pmid= 18799442|doi=10.1001/jama.300.11.1303 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/300.11.1303}}</ref><ref>{{vcite web |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14739-plastic-bottle-chemical-linked-to-heart-disease.html |title=Plastic bottle chemical linked to heart disease |work=New Scientist |author=Alison Motluk |date=September 2008 |accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref> The [[cross-sectional study]] of almost 1,500 people assessed exposure to bisphenol&nbsp;A by looking at levels of the chemical in urine. The authors found that higher bisphenol&nbsp;A levels were [[Statistically significant|significantly]] associated with [[heart disease]], [[diabetes]], and abnormally high levels of certain liver enzymes. An editorial in the same issue concludes:

:"Based on this background information, the study by Lang et al,1 while preliminary with regard to these diseases in humans, should spur US regulatory agencies to follow the recent action taken by Canadian regulatory agencies, which have declared BPA a "toxic chemical" requiring aggressive action to limit human and environmental exposures.4 Alternatively, Congressional action could follow the precedent set with the recent passage of federal legislation designed to limit exposures to another family of compounds, phthalates, also used in plastic. Like BPA,5 phthalates are detectable in virtually everyone in the United States.6 This bill moves US policy closer to the European model, in which industry must provide data on the safety of a chemical before it can be used in products."<ref name="JAMAVS"/><ref>{{vcite doi | 10.1001/jama.300.11.1353}}</ref>

A later similar study performed by the same group of scientists, published in January 2010, confirmed, despite of lower concentrations of BPA in the second study sample, an associated increased risk for heart disease but not for diabetes or liver enzymes. Patients with the highest levels of BPA in their urine carried a 33% increased risk of coronary heart disease.<ref>{{vcite doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0008673}}</ref>  
In 2012, David Melzer and colleagues also published a correlation between BPA levels in urine and heart disease.  BPA exposure was higher in those with severe coronary artery stenoses compared to those with no vessel disease.<ref name="Melzer">{{vcite journal |author=Melzer D, Gates P, Osborn NJ, et al. |year=2012 |title=Urinary bisphenol a concentration and angiography-defined coronary artery stenosis |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0043378 |journal=PLoS ONE 2012 |volume=7 }}</ref>

'''Effects on human oocytes'''
       
In 2011, studies performed in human fetal [[oocyte]]s demonstrated: BPA concentrations of 1 µM or higher decrease the survival of human fetal oocytes in vitro, and concentrations of 10 µM or higher increase MLH1 foci number. MLH1 is considered a crossing-over marker ([[meiotic recombination]])(Brieño-Enríquez et al., 2011). An increment in the recombination points, and an alteration in the number (or localization) of the recombination pattern could affect the segregation of the homologs, leading to an increase in the possibility of generating oocytes with numerical alterations such as [[monosomy]] or [[trisomy]] (Orr-Weaver et al., 1996; Bugge et al., 1998, 2007; Hassold et al., 2007; Oliver et al., 2008; Chowdhury et al., 2009; Cheng et al., 2009; Allard and Colaiacovo, 2010; Brieño-Enriquez et al., 2011. BPA-exposed oocytes. These data suggest that BPA can act as a toxic substance, which has particular implications for human females and the critical events of meiotic prophase, such as pairing-synapsis and recombination processes, as well as oocyte survival<ref>Brieño-Enriquez et al., Hum Reprod. 2011 Oct;26(10):2807-18. doi: 10.1093/humrep/der249. Epub 2011 Jul 26.</ref> The effects of Bisphenol A not only were observed at cytogenetic level. BPA also induces the over-expression of [[Spo11]], [[H2ax]], [[Rpa]] and [[Blm]] in human fetal ovarian cultures. All of these genes are involved in the DSB generation, signaling and repair during meiosis, but some of them are shared with mitosis (H2ax, Rpa and Blm). The up-regulation caused by BPA could disrupt the cell cycle and, in consequence, cell survival and differentiation. Ovarian pieces exposed to BPA also showed an up-regulation of ERs, Erα, Erβ and Errγ, which was also observed in ovarian [[fibroblast]]s, suggesting that these receptors could be related to the effects of BPA on the ovary <ref>Brieño-Enriquez et al., Mol Hum Reprod. 2012 Apr;18(4):171-83. doi: 10.1093/molehr/gar074. Epub 2011 Nov 25</ref>

====Brain tumors====
A Chinese human study conducted from May 15, 2009 to May 15, 2010 links BPA to noncancerous brain tumors. Those with higher urine BPA levels were about 1.6 times more likely to have [[meningioma]] compared to those with lower concentrations.<ref name="pmid22527848">{{cite journal | author = Duan B, Hu X, Zhao H, Qin J, Luo J | title = The relationship between urinary bisphenol A levels and meningioma in Chinese adults | journal = Int J Clin Oncol | year = 2012 | month = April | pmid = 22527848 | doi = 10.1007/s10147-012-0408-6 }}</ref>

==Human exposure sources==
The major human exposure route to BPA is diet, including ingestion of contaminated food and water.<ref>Cichna-Markl, M. Methods (2012).</ref> 
Bisphenol&nbsp;A is leached from the lining of food and beverage cans  where it is used as an ingredient in the plastic used to protect the food from direct contact with the can.<ref>{{vcite web |url=http://www.ewg.org/reports/bisphenola |title=A Survey of Bisphenol A in U.S. Canned Foods |work=Environmental Working Group |date=5 March 2007 |accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref> It is especially likely to leech from plastics when they are a cleaned with harsh detergents or when they contain acidic or high-temperature liquids.   BPA is used to form epoxy resin coating of water pipes; in older buildings, such resin coatings are used to avoid replacement of deteriorating pipes.<ref>{{vcite web|url=http://www.aceduraflo.com/fixmypipes.html|title=Pipeline relining|accessdate=18 October 2010}}</ref>  There is limited evidence on inhalation exposure but the body of research on dermal absorption continues to grow.

In 2011 it was found that Americans of all age groups have twice as much BPA in their bodies as do Canadians, but the reasons for the disparity was unknown.  According to the researcher, there is no evidence to suggest that there are higher amounts of BPA in U.S. foods, or that other consumer products available in the U.S. containing BPA are BPA-free in Canada.  According to Laura Vandenberg, a post-doctoral fellow at Tufts Universitymay be due to differences in how and when the surveys were done.<ref>[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/greenhouse/post/2011/03/us-bpa-twice-canadas-level/1#.UTKRhlKwBPY Study: Americans have twice as much BPA as Canadians<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

===Fetal and early-childhood exposures===
Studies have found that fetuses and young children exposed to BPA are at risk for secondary sexual developmental changes, brain and behavior changes and immune disorders.<ref name="Erler_Novak_2010"/>
Children may be more susceptible to BPA exposure than adults.

Infants fed with liquid formula are among the most exposed, and those fed formula from polycarbonate bottles can consume up to 13 micrograms of bisphenol&nbsp;A per kg of body weight per day (μg/kg/day; see table below).<ref>{{vcite web | title = European Food Safety Authority Opinion | url =http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/science/afc/afc_opinions/bisphenol_a.html | format = Abstract | accessdate =28 February 2007}}</ref> In the US and Canada, BPA has been found in infant liquid formula in concentrations varying from 0.48 to 11&nbsp;ng/g.<ref name="infantformulaUS">{{cite pmid|20102208}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|18702469}}</ref> BPA has been rarely found in infant powder formula (only 1 of 14).<ref name="infantformulaUS"/> While breast milk is the optimal source of nutrition for infants, it is not always an option.

A 2010 study of people in Austria, Switzerland, and Germany has suggested polycarbonate (PC) baby bottles as the most prominent role of exposure for infants, and canned food for adults and teenagers.<ref>{{vcite doi|10.1111/j.1539-6924.2009.01345.x}}</ref> In the United States, the growing concern over BPA exposure in infants in recent years has led the manufacturers of plastic baby bottles to stop using BPA in their bottles. However, babies may still be exposed if they are fed with old or hand-me-down bottles bought before the companies stopped using BPA.

One often overlooked source of exposure occurs when a pregnant woman is exposed, thereby exposing the fetus. Animal studies have shown that BPA can be found in both the placenta and the amniotic fluid of pregnant mice.<ref>{{cite pmid|12611660}}</ref> A small US study in 2009, funded by the [[Environmental Working Group|EWG]], detected an average of 2.8&nbsp;ng/mL BPA in the blood of 9 out of the 10 [[umbilical cord]]s tested.<ref>{{vcite web|url=http://www.ewg.org/files/2009-Minority-Cord-Blood-Report.pdf|title=Cord Blood Contaminants in Minority Newborns|year=2009|publisher=[[Environmental Working Group]]|accessdate=2 December 2009}}</ref> A study of 244 mothers indicated that exposure to BPA before birth could affect the behavior of girls' at age 3. Girls whose mother's urine contained high levels of BPA during pregnancy scored worse on tests of anxiety and hyperactivity. Although these girls still scored within a normal range, for every 10-fold increase in the BPA of the mother, the girls scored at least six points lower on the tests. Boys did not seem to be affected by their mother's BPA levels during pregnancy.<ref>[http://healthland.time.com/2011/10/24/bpa-exposure-in-pregnancy-may-affect-behavior-in-girls/ BPA Exposure in Pregnancy May Affect Behavior in Girls | TIME.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>   After the baby is born, maternal exposure can continue to affect the infant through transfer of BPA to the infant via breast milk.<ref>{{cite pmid|15386523}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|16377264}}</ref> Because of these exposures that can occur both during and after pregnancy, mothers wishing to limit their child's exposure to BPA should attempt to limit their own exposures during that time period.

While the majority of exposures have been shown to come through the diet, accidental ingestion can also be considered a source of exposure. One study conducted in Japan tested plastic baby books to look for possible leaching into saliva when babies chew on them.<ref>{{cite pmid|20508389}}</ref> While the results of this study have yet to be replicated, it gives reason to question whether exposure can also occur in infants through ingestion by chewing on certain books or toys.

==Pharmacokinetics==
There is no agreement between scientists of a [[Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling|physiologically based]] [[pharmacokinetic]] (PBPK) BPA model for humans. The effects of BPA on an organism depend on how much free BPA is available and for how long cells are exposed to it. [[Glucuronidation]] in the liver, by conjugation with glucuronic acid to form the metabolite BPA-glucuronide (BPAG),<ref name="epa-action-plan"/> reduces the amount of free BPA, however BPAG can be deconjugated by [[beta-glucuronidase]], an enzyme present in high concentration in placenta and other tissues.<ref name="Ginsberg"/><ref name="placenta">{{cite pmid|20382578}}</ref> Free BPA can also be inactivated by sulfation, a process that can also be reversed by [[arylsulfatase C]].<ref name="Ginsberg">{{vcite journal|last=Gary Ginsberg and Deborah C.

In general, studies have shown that BPA can affect growth, reproduction and development in aquatic organisms. Among freshwater organisms, fish appear to be the most sensitive species. Evidence of endocrine-related effects in fish, aquatic invertebrates, amphibians and reptiles has been reported at environmentally relevant exposure levels lower than those required for acute toxicity. There is a widespread variation in reported values for endocrine-related effects, but many fall in the range of 1μg/L to 1&nbsp;mg/L.<ref name="epa-action-plan"/>

As an environmental contaminant, BPA interferes with [[nitrogen fixation]] at the roots of [[leguminous]] plants associated with the [[bacterial]] [[symbiont]] ''[[Sinorhizobium meliloti]]''. Despite a [[half-life]] in the soil of only 1–10 days, its ubiquity makes it an important [[pollutant]].<ref name="fox">{{vcite journal |author=Fox, J.E., J. Gulledge, E. Engelhaupt, M.E.

===World Health Organization===
In November 2009, the WHO announced it would organize an expert consultation in 2010 to assess low dose BPA exposure health effects, focusing on the nervous and behavioral system and exposure to young children.<ref name="infosan"/>

The WHO expert panel recommended no new regulations limiting or banning the use of Bisphenol-A, stating that "initiation of public health measures would be premature."<ref>Brown, Eryn.

In 2006, Canadian regulators selected bisphenol A as one of 200 substances deserving of thorough safety assessments, because preliminary studies found it "inherently toxic." They had not previously studied the chemical in depth, having accepted it under [[grandfather clause]]s when stricter regulations were passed in the 1980s.<ref name="globemittelstaedt"/>-->
The federal government proposed declaring {{nowrap|Bisphenol A}} a hazardous substance in October 2008 and has since placed it on its list of toxic substances (October, 2010). Health Canada and Environment Canada officials declared in ''[[Canada Gazette]]'' that bisphenol A is entering or may be entering the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that have or may have an immediate or long-term harmful effect on the environment or its biological diversity. It is concluded that bisphenol A be considered as a substance that may be entering the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that constitute or may constitute a danger in Canada to human life or health. It is therefore concluded that bisphenol A does meet the criteria in paragraphs 64(a) and 64(c) of CEPA 1999. http://www.ec.gc.ca/ese-ees/default.asp?lang=En&n=3C756383-1.

===Japan===
Between 1998 and 2003, the canning industry voluntarily replaced its BPA-containing epoxy resin can liners with BPA-free polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in many of its products. For other products, it switched to a different epoxy lining that yielded much less migration of BPA into food than the previously used resin. In addition, polycarbonate tableware for school lunches was replaced by BPA-free plastics. As a result of these changes, Japanese risk assessors have found that virtually no BPA is detectable in canned foods or drinks, and blood levels of BPA in the Japanese people have declined dramatically (50% in one study).<ref>{{vcite web |url=http://www.ewg.org/node/20938 |title=Bisphenol A: Toxic Plastics Chemical in Canned Food: Companies reduced BPA exposures in Japan |work=Environmental Working Group |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref>

===United States===

Organizations such as the [[American Chemistry Council]] (ACC) have lobbied to make BPA federally recognized as a safe product. The ACC is composed of companies that represent 85% of chemical manufacturing capacity in the United States.<ref>[http://www.americanchemistry.com/Membership/Regular Become an ACC Member Today!]</ref> The ACC position states that BPA is safe for use in products. "Government and scientific bodies around the globe have extensively evaluated the weight of scientific evidence on bisphenol A (BPA) and have declared that BPA is safe as used, including in materials that come into contact with food, such as reusable foodstorage containers and linings in metal cans."<ref>About BPA: Weight of the Scientific Evidence Supports the Safety of BPA. http://plastics.americanchemistry.com/Product-Groups-and-Stats/PolycarbonateBPA-Global-Group/About-BPA-Weight-of-Scientific-Evidence-Supports-the-Safety-of-BPA.pdf. Retrieved 28 March 2012.</ref>

Due to consumer pressure, by 2011 BPA was no longer being used in sippy cups and baby bottles.  In October 2011, the ACC said that it had petitioned the FDA to make it clear to consumers that BPA is no longer present in those products.

In April, the Federal BPA-Free Kids Act of 2008 was introduced to the U.S. Senate.  The bill sought to ban BPA in any product designed for use by children and require the Center for Disease Control conduct a study about the health effects of BPA exposure.  No action was taken.<ref name="Erler_Novak_2010"/>

In September, the National Toxicology Program finalized its report on bisphenol&nbsp;A, finding "some concern", midpoint of a five-level scale, that infants were at risk from exposure to the chemical.<ref name="NTP08"/>

At that time, the FDA reassured consumers that current limits were safe, but convened an outside panel of experts to review the issue. The [[Bisphenol A#Lang study|Lang study]] was also released that month, and David Melzer, a co-author of the study, presented the results of the study before the FDA panel.<ref name="WaPoDos">{{vcite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/09/16/ST2008091601215.html?sid=ST2008091601215&s_pos=list|title=Study Links Chemical BPA to Health Problems|last=Layton|first=Lindsey|date=16 September 2008|work=The Washington Post |pages=A03|accessdate=17 September 2008}}</ref>

The editorial accompanying the Lang study's publication in ''JAMA'' criticized the FDA's assessment of bisphenol&nbsp;A: "A fundamental problem is that the current ADI [acceptable daily intake] for BPA is based on experiments conducted in the early 1980s using outdated methods (only very high doses were tested) and insensitive assays. More recent findings from independent scientists were rejected by the FDA, apparently because those investigators did not follow the outdated testing guidelines for environmental chemicals, whereas studies using the outdated, insensitive assays (predominantly involving studies funded by the chemical industry) are given more weight in arriving at the conclusion that BPA is not harmful at current exposure levels."<ref name="JAMAVS"/>

The FDA recently concluded an assessment of scientific research on the effects of BPA. In the March 2012 Consumer Update, the FDA concluded that "the scientific evidence at this time does not suggest that the very low levels of human exposure to BPA through the diet are unsafe."<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm297954 FDA Continues to Study BPA: Consumer Updates]. Retrieved 4 April 2012.</ref> However, the FDA recognizes potential uncertainties in the overall interpretation of these studies including route of exposure used in the studies and the relevance of animal models to human health. The FDA is continuing to pursue additional research to resolve these uncertainties.

On 17 July, the FDA banned BPA from baby bottles and sippy cups. Since manufacturers have already stopped using the chemical in baby bottles and sippy cups, the decision was not over concerns about the safety of BPA but a response to a request by the [[American Chemistry Council]], the chemical industry's main trade association, who believe that a ban would boost consumer confidence.<ref>Sabrina Tavernise, [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/18/science/fda-bans-bpa-from-baby-bottles-and-sippy-cups.html F.D.A.

In a statement they said,"If the agency truly wants to prevent people from being exposed to this toxic chemical associated with a variety of serious and chronic conditions it should ban its use in cans of infant formula, food and beverages."

== Substitute chemicals ==

The industry has responded to criticism of BPA by promoting "BPA-free" products, which are made from plastic containing a compound called [[bisphenol S]] (BPS).  BPS, which shares a similar structure and versatility to BPA, is now being used in everything from currency to thermal receipt paper, and widespread human exposure to BPS was confirmed in a 2012 analysis of urine samples taken in the U.S., Japan, China and five other Asian countries.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/07/120711210241.htm Widespread exposure to BPA substitute is occurring from cash register receipts, other paper<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Recent research suggests that endocrine -disrupting chemicals may in fact be much more common to many or most plastics than was previously realized. In 2011 researchers looked at 455 common plastic products and found that 70% tested positive for estrogenic activity.  After the products had been washed or microwaved the proportion rose to 95%. The study concluded:

:"Almost all commercially available plastic products we sampled, independent of the type of resin, product, or retail source, leached chemicals having reliably-detectable EA [endocrine activity], including those advertised as BPA-free. In some cases, BPA-free products released chemicals having more EA than BPA-containing products."<ref>http://healthland.time.com/2011/03/08/study-even-bpa-free-plastics-leach-endrocrine-disrupting-chemicals/</ref>

A 2011 study found that people are being exposed to high levels of BPS in cash register thermal paper receipts and many of the other products that engendered concerns about the health effects of BPA.  The researchers found BPS in all the receipt paper they tested, 87 percent of the samples of paper currency and 52 percent of recycled paper. The study found  that people may be absorbing 19 times more BPS through their skin than the amount of BPA they absorbed when it was more widely used.<ref>[http://healthland.time.com/2011/03/08/study-even-bpa-free-plastics-leach-endrocrine-disrupting-chemicals/ BPA and Other Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals May Be Even More Common in Plastics Than First Thought | TIME.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

According to a 2013 study, BPS shares similar problems to BPA in that it has been found to be an estrogen hormone disruptor even at extremely low levels of exposure.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/01/130122191412.htm BPA substitute could spell trouble: Experiments show bisphenol S also disrupts hormone activity<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
