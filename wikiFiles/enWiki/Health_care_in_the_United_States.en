{{Health care reform in the United States}}

'''Health care in the United States''' is provided by many distinct organizations. [[Health care]] facilities are largely owned and operated by [[private sector]] businesses. [[Health insurance in the United States|Health insurance]] for [[public sector]] employees is primarily provided by the government. 60-65% of healthcare provision and spending comes from programs such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], [[TRICARE]], the [[Children's Health Insurance Program]], and the [[Veterans Health Administration]]. Most of the population under 65 is insured by their or a family member's employer, some buy health insurance on their own, and the remainder are uninsured.

Of 17 high-income countries studied by the [[National Institutes of Health]] in 2013, the United States was at or near the bottom in [[infant mortality]], heart and lung disease, sexually transmitted infections, adolescent pregnancies, injuries, homicides, and rates of disability. Together, such issues place the U.S. at the bottom of the list for life expectancy. On average, a U.S. male can be expected to live almost four fewer years than those in the top-ranked country.<ref name=nihbph>[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13497 "U.S. Health in International Perspective: Shorter Lives, Poorer Health"] (2013) National Institutes of Health Committee on Population, Board on Population Health and Public Health Practice</ref>

According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the United States spent more on [[List of countries by total health expenditure (PPP) per capita|health care per capita]] ($7,146), and more on health care as percentage of its [[gross domestic product|GDP]] (15.2%), than any other nation in 2008. The [[Commonwealth Fund]] ranked the United States last in the quality of health care among similar countries, and notes U.S. care costs the most. 

The [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] reported that 49.9 million residents, 16.3% of the population, were uninsured in 2010 (up from 49.0 million residents, 16.1% of the population, in 2009). A 2004 [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) report said: "The United States is among the few industrialized nations in the world that ''does not guarantee access'' to health care for its population." A 2004 [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] report said: "With the exception of Mexico, Turkey, and the United States, all [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development#Member countries|OECD countries]] had achieved universal or near-universal (at least 98.4% insured) coverage of their populations by 1990." A 2010 report observed that lack of health insurance causes roughly 48,000 unnecessary deaths every year in the United States.<ref name=uninsureddeaths/> In 2007, 62.1% of filers for bankruptcies claimed high medical expenses. A 2013 study found that about 25% of all senior citizens declare bankruptcy due to medical expenses, and 43% are forced to mortgage or sell their primary residence.<ref name=kelley2013>[http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-012-2199-x "Out-of-Pocket Spending in the Last Five Years of Life"] ''Journal of General Internal Medicine'', February 2013, Volume 28, Issue 2, pp 304-309</ref>

On March 23, 2010, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA) became law, providing for major changes in health insurance.

A large proportion of health outcomes and early mortality has nothing to do with medical care, but is the result of poor lifestyle choices such as drug and alcohol abuse, and an environment that tends to favor travel by automobile over exercise, and poor dietary habits.<ref>http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/01/09/168976602/u-s-ranks-below-16-other-rich-countries-in-health-report</ref>

Active debate about [[health care reform in the United States]] concerns questions of a [[rights|right to health care]], access, fairness, efficiency, cost, choice, value, and quality. Some have argued that the system does not deliver equivalent value for the money spent. The [[Comparison of the health care systems in Canada and the United States|USA pays twice as much as Canada yet lags behind other wealthy nations]] in such measures as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]].

==Providers==
[[Health care provider]]s in the US encompass individual health care personnel, health care facilities and medical products.

===Facilities===
{{Main|Medical centers in the United States}}
In the United States, ownership of the health care system is mainly in private hands, though federal, state, county, and city governments also own certain facilities. 

The [[non-profit hospital]]s share of total hospital capacity has remained relatively stable (about 70%) for decades.<ref>http://www.aeaweb.org/annual_mtg_papers/2006/0106_0800_0204.pdf</ref>  There are also [[For-profit hospital|privately owned for-profit hospitals]] as well as [[public hospital|government hospitals]] in some locations, mainly owned by county and city governments. In 1946 the [[Hill-Burton Act]] was passed, which provided federal funding for hospitals in exchange for treating poor patients.<ref>[http://congress.indiana.edu/hill%E2%80%93burton-act The Hill–Burton Act]. The Center on Congress at Indiana University.</ref>

There is no nationwide system of government-owned medical facilities open to the general public but there are local government-owned medical facilities open to the general public.  The federal [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] operates field hospitals as well as permanent hospitals (the [[Military Health System]]), to provide military-funded care to active military personnel.  

The federal [[Veterans Health Administration]] operates [[List of Veterans Affairs medical facilities|VA hospitals]] open only to veterans, though veterans who seek medical care for conditions they did not receive while serving in the military are charged for services.  The [[Indian Health Service]] operates facilities open only to Native Americans from recognized tribes.  These facilities, plus tribal facilities and privately contracted services funded by IHS to increase system capacity and capabilities, provide medical care to tribespeople beyond what can be paid for by any private insurance or other government programs.<ref>[http://info.ihs.gov/CHS.asp The Indian Health Service Fact Sheets<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Hospital]]s provide some outpatient care in their emergency rooms and specialty clinics, but primarily exist to provide inpatient care. Hospital [[emergency department]]s and [[urgent care]] centers are sources of sporadic problem-focused care. "[[Surgicenter]]s" are examples of specialty clinics. [[Hospice]] services for the terminally ill who are expected to live six months or less are most commonly subsidized by charities and government. Prenatal, [[family planning]], and "[[dysplasia]]" clinics are government-funded [[obstetric]] and [[gynecologic]] specialty clinics respectively, and are usually staffed by nurse practitioners.

===Physicians (M.D. and D.O.)===
{{Main|Physician in the United States}}
Physicians in the United States include those trained by the [[Medical education in the United States|US medical education]] system, and those that are [[international medical graduate]]s who have progressed through the necessary steps to acquire a [[medical license]] to practice in a state.

The [[American College of Physicians]], uses the term ''physician'' to describe all medical practitioners holding a professional [[medical degree]].  In the United States, however, most physicians have either an [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] or a [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]] degree. The [[American Medical Association]] as well as the [[American Osteopathic Association]] both currently use the term ''physician'' to describe members.

===Medical products, research and development===
As in most other countries, the manufacture and production of [[Medication|pharmaceuticals]] and [[medical devices]] is carried out by private companies. The research and development of medical devices and pharmaceuticals is supported by both public and private sources of funding. In 2003, research and development expenditures were approximately $95 billion with $40 billion coming from public sources and $55 billion coming from private sources.<ref>EMRC WHITE PAPER: Present Status and Future Strategy for Medical Research in Europe http://www.csic.es/vri/otros-programas/esf/EMRC_Whitepaper.pdf (Open using Adobe reader) Page 16</ref><ref name="Medical Research Spending Doubled Over Past Decade">[http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/HealthPolicy/tb/1767 Medical Research Spending Doubled Over Past Decade], Neil Osterweil, [[MedPage Today]], September 20, 2005</ref>

==Spending==
{{Main|Health care spending in the United States}}
[[File:International Comparison - Healthcare spending as % GDP.png|thumb|400px|U.S. healthcare costs exceed those of other countries, relative to the size of the economy or GDP.]]

Health care spending in the United States is characterized as being the most costly per person as compared to all other countries, and despite this spending, the quality of health care overall is low by some measures.

According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), total health care spending in the U.S. was 15.2% of its [[gross domestic product|GDP]] in 2008, the [[List of countries by total health expenditure (PPP) per capita|highest]] in the world.<ref name="WHO 2011"/> The Health and Human Services Department expects that the health share of GDP will continue its historical upward trend, reaching 19.5% of GDP by 2017.<ref name="NHE Fact Sheet">[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/25_NHE_Fact_Sheet.asp#TopOfPage "National Health Expenditure Data: NHE Fact Sheet,"] [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]], referenced February 26, 2008</ref><ref>Sean Keehan, Andrea Sisko, Christopher Truffer, Sheila Smith, Cathy Cowan, John Poisal, M.

Around 84.7% of Americans have some form of [[Health insurance in the United States|health insurance]]; either through their employer or the employer of their spouse or parent (59.3%), purchased individually (8.9%), or provided by government programs (27.8%; there is some overlap in these figures).<ref name="Census 2007">[http://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/p60-235.pdf "Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2007."] U.S. Census Bureau.

Americans without health insurance coverage in 2007 totaled 15.3% of the population, or 45.7&nbsp;million people.<ref name="Census 2007" />

Among those whose employer pays for health insurance, the employee may be required to contribute part of the cost of this insurance, while the employer usually chooses the insurance company and, for large groups, negotiates with the insurance company. Government programs directly cover 27.8% of the population (83&nbsp;million),<ref name="Census 2007"/> including the elderly, disabled, children, veterans, and some of the poor, and federal law mandates public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay. Public spending accounts for between 45% and 56.1% of U.S. health care spending.<ref name="content.healthaffairs.org">Thomas M. Selden and Merrile Sing, [http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/reprint/hlthaff.27.5.w349v1 "The Distribution Of Public Spending For Health Care In The United States, 2002,"] [[Health Affairs]] 27, no. 5 (2008): w349-w359 (published online 29 July 2008)</ref>

Some Americans do not qualify for government-provided health insurance, are not provided health insurance by an employer, and are unable to afford, cannot qualify for, or choose not to purchase, private health insurance.  When charity or "uncompensated" care is not available, they sometimes simply go without needed medical treatment.  This problem has become a source of considerable political controversy on a national level.

==Regulation and oversight==
{{Further|American Board of Medical Specialties|United States Medical Licensing Examination|National Association of Insurance Commissioners}}

===Involved organizations and institutions===
Healthcare is subject to extensive regulation at both the [[federal government of the United States|federal]] and the [[U.S. state|state level]], much of which "arose haphazardly".<ref name=just/> Under this system, the federal government cedes primary responsibility to the states under the [[McCarran-Ferguson Act]]. Essential regulation includes the [[licensure]] of [[health care provider]]s at the state level and the testing and approval of [[pharmaceutical]]s and [[medical device]]s by the [[Food and Drug Administration]], and laboratory testing. These regulations are designed to protect consumers from ineffective or fraudulent healthcare. Additionally, states regulate the health insurance market and they often have laws which require that health insurance companies cover certain procedures,<ref name=Bunce&Wieske2008>Victoria Craig Bunce and JP Wieske, [http://www.cahi.org/cahi_contents/resources/pdf/HealthInsuranceMandates2008.pdf "Health Insurance Mandates in the States 2008"], The Council for Affordable Health Insurance, 2008</ref> although state mandates generally do not apply to the [[self-funded health care]] plans offered by large employers, which exempt from state laws under preemption clause of the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]]. In 2010, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA) was passed, and includes various new regulations, with one of the most notable being a [[health insurance mandate]] which requires all citizens to purchase health insurance. While not regulation per se, the federal government also has a major influence on the healthcare market through its payments to providers under Medicare and Medicaid, which in some cases are used as a reference point in the negotiations between medical providers and insurance companies.<ref name=just/>

At the federal level, [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] oversees the various federal agencies involved in health care. The health agencies are a part of the [[United States Public Health Service]], and include the Food and Drug Administration, which certifies the safety of food, effectiveness of drugs and medical products, the Centers for Disease Prevention, which prevents disease, premature death, and disability, the Agency of Health Care Research and Quality, the Agency Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, which regulates hazardous spills of toxic substances, and the [[National Institutes of Health]], which conducts [[medical research]].

[[State governments of the United States|State governments]] maintain [[state health department]]s, and [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] ([[County (United States)|counties]] and [[Municipality|municipalities]]) often have their own health departments, usually branches of the state health department. Regulations of a state board may have executive and police strength to enforce state health laws.  In some states, all members of state boards must be health care professionals.  Members of state boards may be assigned by the governor or elected by the state committee.  Members of local boards may be elected by the mayor council. The McCarran–Ferguson Act, which cedes regulation to the states, does not itself regulate insurance, nor does it mandate that states regulate insurance. "Acts of Congress" that do not expressly purport to regulate the "business of insurance" will not preempt state laws or regulations that regulate the "business of insurance." The Act also provides that federal anti-trust laws will not apply to the "business of insurance" as long as the state regulates in that area, but federal anti-trust laws will apply in cases of boycott, coercion, and intimidation. By contrast, most other federal laws will not apply to insurance whether the states regulate in that area or not.

[[Self-policing]] of providers by providers is a major part of oversight. Many health care organizations also voluntarily submit to inspection and certification by the [[Joint Commission]] on Accreditation of Hospital Organizations, JCAHO. Providers also undergo testing to obtain [[board certification]] attesting to their skills. A report issued by [[Public Citizen]] in April 2008 found that, for the third year in a row, the number of serious disciplinary actions against physicians by state medical boards declined from 2006 to 2007, and called for more oversight of the boards.<ref>[http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?DR_ID=51710 "Coverage & Access: Disciplinary Action Against Physicians Dropped 6% From 2006 to 2007, Report Finds,"] Kaiser Daily Health Policy Report, [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], April 23, 2008.

The [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) publishes an on-line searchable database of performance data on [[nursing homes]].<ref>[http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare/Include/DataSection/Questions/SearchCriteria.asp?version=default&browser=IE%7C6%7CWinXP&language=English&defaultstatus=0&pagelist=Home&CookiesEnabledStatus=True Nursing Home Compare,] [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (accessed 4/24/2008). Note, CMS also publishes a list of Special Focus Facilities - nursing homes with "a history of serious quality issues" at [http://www.cms.hhs.gov/CertificationandComplianc/Downloads/SFFList.pdf Special Focus Facility ("SFF") Initiative].</ref>

The regulation is controversial. In 2004, conservative think tank [[Cato Institute]] published a study which concluded that regulation provides benefits in the amount of $170&nbsp;billion but costs the public up to $340&nbsp;billion.<ref name="Cato2004">{{cite journal | title = Health Care Regulation: A $169 Billion Hidden Tax | author = Christopher J.

=== "Certificates of need" for hospitals ===
In 1978, the federal government required that all states implement Certificate of Need (CON) programs for cardiac care, meaning that hospitals had to apply and receive certificates prior to implementing the program; the intent was to reduce cost by reducing duplicate investments in facilities.<ref name="Hoetal2009"/> It has been observed that these certificates could be used to increase costs through weakened competition.<ref name=just>[http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/health_care/204694.pdf Improving Health Care: A Dose of Competition], Report by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, 2004</ref> Many states removed the CON programs after the federal requirement expired in 1986, but some states still have these programs.<ref name="Hoetal2009">{{cite journal| author=Ho V, Ku-Goto MH, Jollis JG| title=Certificate of Need (CON) for cardiac care: controversy over the contributions of CON | journal=Health Serv Res | year= 2009 | volume= 44 | issue= 2 Pt 1 | pages= 483–500 | pmid=19207590 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2008.00933.x | pmc=2677050 | url=}}</ref> Empirical research looking at the costs in areas where these programs have been discontinued have not found a clear effect on costs, and the CON programs could decrease costs because of reduced facility construction or increase costs due to reduced competition.<ref name="Hoetal2009"/>

=== Licensing of providers ===
[[American Medical Association]] (AMA) has lobbied the government to highly limit physician education since 1910, currently at 100,000 doctors per year,<ref name=evilama>[http://reason.com/archives/2009/08/27/the-evil-mongering-of-the-amer The Evil-Mongering of the American Medical Association], Shikha Dalmia, Aug 27, 2009</ref> which has led to a shortage of doctors<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-03-02-doctor-shortage_x.htm Medical miscalculation creates doctor shortage], USA Today, March 2, 2005</ref> and physicians' wages in the U.S. are double those in the Europe, which is a major reason for the more expensive health care.<ref name=nytbill/>

An even bigger problem may be that the doctors are paid for procedures instead of results.<ref name=nytbill>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/weekinreview/29berenson.html?_r=5&ex=1187323200&en=2006b742be8795d8&ei=5070 Sending Back the Doctor's Bill], ''The New York Times'' July 29, 2007</ref>

AMA has also aggressively lobbied for many restrictions that require doctors to carry out operations that might be carried out by cheaper workforce. For example, in 1995, 36 states banned or restricted midwifery even though it delivers equally safe care to that by doctors, according to studies {{Clarify||Please CITE STUDIES |date=September 2012}} .  The regulation lobbied by AMA has decreased the amount and quality of health care, according to the consensus of economist: the restrictions do not add to quality, they decrease the supply of care.<ref name=evilama/><ref name=agree>[http://ideas.repec.org/a/ejw/volone/279-305.html Licensing Doctors: Do Economists Agree?]</ref> {{Clarify||Reference are missing|date=November 2012}} Moreover, psychologists, nurses and pharmacologists are not allowed to prescribe medicines.{{Clarify||sentence intends to say "write formal prescriptions.

====Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA)====
{{Main|Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act}}
EMTALA, enacted by the federal government in 1986, requires that hospital emergency departments treat emergency conditions of all patients regardless of their ability to pay and is considered a critical element in the "safety net" for the uninsured, but established no direct payment mechanism for such care. Indirect payments and reimbursements through federal and state government programs have never fully compensated public and private hospitals for the full cost of care mandated by EMTALA. In fact, more than half of all emergency care in the U.S. now goes uncompensated.<ref name="ACEP">[http://www.acep.org/patients.aspx?id=25932 The Uninsured: Access to Medical Care], American College of Emergency Physicians. Retrieved 2007-10-30.</ref> According to some analyses, EMTALA is an unfunded mandate that has contributed to financial pressures on hospitals in the last 20 years, causing them to consolidate and close facilities, and contributing to emergency room overcrowding. According to the [[Institute of Medicine]], between 1993 and 2003, emergency room visits in the U.S. grew by 26%, while in the same period, the number of emergency departments declined by 425.<ref name="IOM fact sheet">[http://www.iom.edu/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2006/Hospital-Based-Emergency-Care-At-the-Breaking-Point/EmergencyCareFindingsandRecs.ashx Fact Sheet: The Future of Emergency Care: Key Findings and Recommendations], Institute of Medicine, 2006. Retrieved 2007-10-07.</ref>

Mentally ill patients present a unique challenge for emergency departments and hospitals. In accordance with EMTALA, mentally ill patients who enter emergency rooms are evaluated for emergency medical conditions. Once mentally ill patients are medically stable, regional mental health agencies are contacted to evaluate them. Patients are evaluated as to whether they are a danger to themselves or others. Those meeting this criterion are admitted to a mental health facility to be further evaluated by a psychiatrist. Typically, mentally ill patients can be held for up to 72 hours, after which a court order is required.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Quality assurance===
Health care quality assurance consists of the "activities and programs intended to assure or improve the quality of care in either a defined medical setting or a program. The concept includes the assessment or evaluation of the quality of care; identification of problems or shortcomings in the delivery of care; designing activities to overcome these deficiencies; and follow-up monitoring to ensure effectiveness of corrective steps."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2011/MB_cgi?mode=&term=Quality Assurance, Health Care |title=Quality Assurance, Health Care|author=Anonymous|publisher=National Library of Medicine|location=Bethesda, MD |accessdate= |format= |work=}}</ref>

One innovation in encouraging quality of health care is the public reporting of the performance of hospitals, health professionals or providers, and healthcare organizations. However, there is "no consistent evidence that the public release of performance data changes consumer behaviour or improves care."<ref name="pmid22071813">{{cite journal| author=Ketelaar NA, Faber MJ, Flottorp S, Rygh LH, Deane KH, Eccles MP| title=Public release of performance data in changing the behaviour of healthcare consumers, professionals or organisations | journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev | year= 2011 | volume= 11 | issue=  11| pages= CD004538 | pmid=22071813 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004538.pub2 | pmc= | url=| editor1-last=Ketelaar| editor1-first=Nicole ABM }}</ref>

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) found that the United States ranked poorly in terms of [[Years of potential life lost]] (YPLL), a statistical measure of years of life lost under the age of 70 that were amenable to being saved by health care.  Among OECD nations for which data are available, the United States ranked third last for the health care of women (after Mexico and Hungary) and fifth last for men (Slovakia and Poland were also worse).  See the table and source at [[Years of potential life lost|YPLL]] for details.

Recent studies find growing gaps in life expectancy based on income and geography. In 2008, a government-sponsored study found that life expectancy declined from 1983 to 1999 for women in 180 counties, and for men in 11 counties, with most of the life expectancy declines occurring the Deep South, Appalachia, along the Mississippi River, in the Southern Plains and in Texas.

The debate about U.S. health care concerns questions of access, efficiency, and quality purchased by the high sums spent. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in 2000 ranked the U.S. health care system first in responsiveness, but 37th in overall performance and 72nd by overall level of health (among 191 member nations included in the study).<ref name="photius.com"/><ref name="who.int"/> The WHO study has been criticized by the free market advocate [[David Gratzer]] because "fairness in financial contribution" was used as an assessment factor, marking down countries with high per-capita private or fee-paying health treatment.<ref name="fmc">[[David Gratzer]], [http://www.freemarketcure.com/whynotgovhc.php Why Isn't Government Health Care The Answer?], ''Free Market Cure'', 16 July 2007</ref>  The WHO study has been criticized, in an article published in ''Health Affairs'', for its failure to include the satisfaction ratings of the general public.<ref>Robert J.

A report released in April 2008 by the Foundation for Child Development, which studied the period from 1994 through 2006, found mixed results for the health of children in the U.S.  Mortality rates for children ages 1 through 4 dropped by a third, and the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels dropped by 84%.  The percentage of mothers who smoked during pregnancy also declined.  On the other hand, both obesity and the percentage of low-birth weight babies increased.  The authors note that the increase in babies born with low birth weights can be attributed to women delaying childbearing and the increased use of fertility drugs.<ref>Donna St. George, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/23/AR2008042303666.html "For Children, a Better Beginning,"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', April 24, 2008</ref><ref>Kenneth C.

==System efficiency and equity==
Variations in the efficiency of health care delivery can cause variations in outcomes. The [[The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice|Dartmouth Atlas Project]], for instance, reported that, for over 20 years, marked variations in how medical resources are distributed and used in the United States were accompanied by marked variations in outcomes.<ref>[http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/index.shtm Dartmouth Atlas review of regional disparities.]</ref> The willingness of physicians to work in an area varies with the income of the area and the amenities it offers, a situation aggravated by a general shortage of doctors in the United States, particularly those who offer primary care.

====Value for money====
A study of international health care spending levels published in the health policy journal ''[[Health Affairs]]'' in the year 2000 found that the United States spends substantially more on health care than any other country in the [[Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), and that the use of health care services in the U.S. is below the OECD median by most measures.  The authors of the study conclude that the prices paid for health care services are much higher in the U.S. than elsewhere.<ref name="Prices Stupid">Gerard F. Anderson, Uwe E. Reinhardt, Peter S.

====Delays in seeking care and increased use of emergency care====
Uninsured Americans are less likely to have regular health care and use preventive services. They are more likely to delay seeking care, resulting in more medical crises, which are more expensive than ongoing treatment for such conditions as diabetes and high blood pressure. A 2007 study published in ''JAMA'' concluded that uninsured people were less likely than the insured to receive any medical care after an accidental injury or the onset of a new chronic condition. The uninsured with an injury were also twice as likely as those with insurance to have received none of the recommended follow-up care, and a similar pattern held for those with a new chronic condition.<ref>Hadley, Jack, [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/297/10/1073?ijkey=n3EAhc0mdQ3nc&keytype=ref&siteid=amajnls "Insurance Coverage, Medical Care Use, and Short-term Health Changes Following an Unintentional Injury or the Onset of a Chronic Condition"], JAMA, March 14, 2007; 297: 1073–1084.</ref> Uninsured patients are twice as likely to visit hospital emergency rooms as those with insurance; burdening a system meant for true emergencies with less-urgent care needs.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad388.pdf National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey]</ref>

====Shared costs of the uninsured====
{{Main|Uninsured in the United States}}

The costs of treating the uninsured must often be absorbed by providers as [[charity care]], passed on to the insured via cost shifting and higher health insurance premiums, or paid by taxpayers through higher taxes.<ref>[http://www.acponline.org/hpp/cost.pdf The Cost of Lack of Health Insurance,] [[American College of Physicians]]</ref> However, hospitals and other providers are reimbursed for the cost of providing uncompensated care via a federal matching fund program. Each state enacts legislation governing the reimbursement of funds to providers. In Missouri, for example, providers assessments totaling $800&nbsp;million are matched — $2 for each assessed $1 — to create a pool of approximately $2&nbsp;billion. By federal law these funds are transferred to the Missouri Hospital Association for disbursement to hospitals for the costs incurred providing uncompenstated care including Disproportionate Share Payments (to hospitals with high quantities of uninsured patients), Medicaid shortfalls, Medicaid managed care payments to insurance companies and other costs incurred by hospitals.<ref>http://web.mhanet.com/UserDocs/articles/FRA.pdf</ref> In New Hampshire, by statute, reimbursable uncompensated care costs shall include: charity care costs, any portion of Medicaid patient care costs that are unreimbursed by Medicaid payments, and any portion of bad debt costs that the commissioner determines would meet the criteria under 42&nbsp;U.S.C. section&nbsp;1396r-4(g) governing hospital-specific limits on disproportionate share hospital payments under Title&nbsp;XIX of the Social Security Act.<ref>http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/xii/167/167-64.htm</ref>

A report published by the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] in April 2008 found that economic downturns place a significant strain on state [[Medicaid]] and [[State Children's Health Insurance Program|SCHIP]] programs.  The authors estimated that a 1%&nbsp;increase in the unemployment rate would increase Medicaid and SCHIP enrollment by 1&nbsp;million, and increase the number uninsured by 1.1&nbsp;million.  State spending on Medicaid and SCHIP would increase by $1.4&nbsp;billion (total spending on these programs would increase by $3.4&nbsp;billion).  This increased spending would occur at the same time state government revenues were declining.  During the last downturn, the [[Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003]] (JGTRRA) included federal assistance to states, which helped states avoid tightening their Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility rules.  The authors conclude that [[United States Congress|Congress]] should consider similar relief for the current economic downturn.<ref>Stan Dorn, Bowen Garrett, John Holahan, and Aimee Williams, [http://www.kff.org/medicaid/upload/7770.pdf "Medicaid, SCHIP and Economic Downturn:Policy Challenges and Policy Responses,"] [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], April 2008</ref>

====Variations in provider practices====
The treatment given to a patient can vary significantly depending on which health care providers they use.  Research suggests that some cost-effective treatments are not used as often as they should be, while [[overutilization]] occurs with other health care services. Unnecessary treatments increase costs and can cause patients unnecessary anxiety.<ref>Valerie Ulene, [http://www.latimes.com/features/printedition/health/la-he-themd5-2008may05,0,2608989.story "Costs of overtreating patients,"] [[Los Angeles Times]], May 5, 2008</ref> The use of prescription drugs varies significantly by geographic region.<ref>Emily Cox, Doug Mager, Ed Weisbart, [http://www.express-scripts.com/ourcompany/news/outcomesresearch/onlinepublications/study/geoVariationTrends.pdf "Geographic Variation Trends in Prescription Use: 2000 to 2006,"]{{Dead link|date=August 2009}} [[Express Scripts]], January 2008</ref> The overuse of medical benefits is known as [[moral hazard]] -individuals who are insured are then more inclined to consume health care. The way the Health care system tries to eliminate this problem is through cost sharing tactics like co-pays and deductibles. If patients face more of the economic burden they will then only consume health care when it is necessary. According to the RAND health insurance experiment, individuals with higher Coinsurance rates consumed less health care than those with lower rates. The experiment concluded that with less consumption of care there was generally no loss in societal welfare but, for the poorer and sicker groups of people there were definitely negative effects. These patients were forced to forgo necessary preventative care measures in order to save money leading to late diagnosis of easily treated diseases and more expensive procedures later. With less preventative care, the patient is hurt financially with an increase in expensive visits to the ER.The Health Care costs in the U.S will also rise with these procedures as well. More expensive procedures lead to greater costs.<ref>[http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/topics/effective_care.pdf "Effective Care,"] The Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, January 15, 2007</ref><ref>Laurence C.

One study has found significant geographic variations in Medicare spending for patients in the last two years of life.  These spending levels are associated with the amount of hospital capacity available in each area.  Higher spending did not result in patients living longer.<ref name=DartmouthAtlas2008>John E.

====Care coordination====
Primary care doctors are often the point of entry for most patients needing care, but in the fragmented health care system of the U.S., many patients and their providers experience problems with care coordination. For example, a Harris Interactive survey of California physicians found that: 
*Four of every ten physicians report that their patients have had problems with coordination of their care in the last 12 months.
*More than 60% of doctors report that their patients "sometimes" or "often" experience long wait times for diagnostic tests.
*Some 20% of doctors report having their patients repeat tests because of an inability to locate the results during a scheduled visit.<ref>California HealthCare Foundation, [http://www.chcf.org/topics/view.cfm?itemid=133466] "Uncoordinated Care: A Survey of Physician and Patient Experience"], Harris Interactive. 2007. Retrieved March 20, 2008.</ref>

According to an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', the relationship between doctors and patients is deteriorating.<ref name="NYTJuly2008">Tare Parker-Pople, [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/29/health/29well.html?scp=1&sq=doctor%20and%20patient%20now%20at%20odds&st=cse "Well: Doctor and Patient, Now at Odds,"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 29, 2008</ref> A study from [[Johns Hopkins University]] found that roughly one in four patients believe their doctors have exposed them to unnecessary risks, and anecdotal evidence such as self-help books and web postings suggest increasing patient frustration.  Possible factors behind the deteriorating doctor/patient relationship include the current system for training physicians and differences in how doctors and patients view the practice of medicine.  Doctors may focus on diagnosis and treatment, while patients may be more interested in wellness and being listened to by their doctors.<ref name="NYTJuly2008"/>

Many primary care physicians no longer see their patients while they are in the hospital. Instead, [[hospitalist]]s are used, which fragments care because hospitalists usually have had no previous relationship with the patient they are treating and do not have a personal knowledge of the patient's medical history.<ref>Hospitalists and the family physician [http://www.aafp.org/afp/980800ap/edit.html] by Bruce Bagley, M.D.; American Family Physician</ref><ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3225/is_/ai_21038649?tag=artBody;col1 Hospitalist concept: another dangerous trend]{{Dead link|date=August 2009}} by Robert G. Brown, M.D.; American Family Physician</ref> The use of hospitalists is sometimes mandated by health insurance companies as a cost-saving measure which is resented by some primary care physicians.<ref>[http://www.acpinternist.org/archives/1999/05/hosps.htm Use of mandatory hospitalists blasted], American College of Physicians</ref>

====Administrative costs====
The health care system in the U.S. has a vast number of players. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of insurance companies in the U.S.<ref name="Krugman">[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 "The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It"]
By Paul Krugman, Robin Wells, New York Review of Books, March 23, 2006</ref><ref>The trade association [[America's Health Insurance Plans]], has some 1,300&nbsp;members.</ref> This system has considerable administrative overhead, far greater than in nationalized, single-payer systems, such as Canada's. An oft-cited study by Harvard Medical School and the Canadian Institute for Health Information determined that some 31% of U.S. health care dollars, or more than $1,000 per person per year, went to health care administrative costs, nearly double the administrative overhead in Canada, on a percentage basis.<ref>[http://www.pnhp.org/publications/nejmadmin.pdf "Costs of Health Administration in the U.S. and Canada"], Woolhandler, et al., NEJM 349(8) Sept. 21, 2003</ref>

According to the insurance industry group [[America's Health Insurance Plans]], administrative costs for private health insurance plans have averaged approximately 12% of premiums over the last 40 years. There has been a shift in the type and distribution of administrative expenses over that period. The cost of adjudicating claims has fallen, while insurers are spending more on other administrative activities, such as medical management, nurse help lines, and negotiating discounted fees with health care providers.<ref>Jeff Lemieux, [http://www.ahipresearch.org/pdfs/Administrative_Costs_030705.pdf "Perspective: Administrative Costs of Private Health Insurance Plans"], [[America's Health Insurance Plans]], 2005</ref>

A 2003 study published by the [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association]] also found that health insurer administrative costs were approximately 11% to 12% of premiums, with Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans reporting slightly lower administrative costs, on average, than commercial insurers.<ref>[http://www.bcbs.com/betterknowledge/cost/Cost_Admin030703.pdf "Understanding Health Plan Administrative Costs"]{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}, [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association|Blue Cross Blue Shield Association]], 2003</ref> For the period 1998 through 2003, average insurer administrative costs declined from 12.9% to 11.6% of premiums.  The largest increases in administrative costs were in customer service and information technology, and the largest decreases were in provider services and contracting and in general administration.<ref>Kent J. Sacia and Robert H. Dobson, "Health Plan Administrative Cost Trends," Prepared for the [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association|BlueCross BlueShield Association]] by Milliman USA, February 20, 2003</ref>  The McKinsey Global Institute estimated that excess spending on "health administration and insurance" accounted for as much as 21% of the estimated total excess spending ($477&nbsp;billion in 2003).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/21/why-does-us-health-care-cost-so-much-part-ii-indefensible-administrative-costs/ | work=The New York Times | title=Why Does U.S. Health Care Cost So Much?

According to a report published by the [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] in 2008, administrative costs for private insurance represent approximately 12% of premiums.  Variations in administrative costs between private plans are largely attributable to economies of scale.  Coverage for large employers has the lowest administrative costs.  The percentage of premium attributable to administration increases for smaller firms, and is highest for individually purchased coverage.<ref>[[Congressional Budget Office|U.S. Congressional Budget Office]], [http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/99xx/doc9924/12-18-keyissues.pdf ''Key Issues in Analyzing Major Health Insurance Proposals''], December 2008</ref>  A 2009 study published by the [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association]] found that the average administrative expense cost for all commercial health insurance products was represented 9.18% of premiums in 2008.<ref name="Sherlock 2009"/>  Administrative costs were 11.12% of premiums for small group products and 16.35% in the individual market.<ref name="Sherlock 2009">Douglas B. Sherlock, [http://www.bcbs.com/issues/uninsured/Sherlock-Report-FINAL.pdf "Administrative Expenses of Health Plans"], [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association|Blue Cross Blue Shield Association]], 2009</ref>

One study of the billing and insurance-related (BIR) costs borne not only by insurers but also by physicians and hospitals found that BIR among insurers, physicians, and hospitals in California represented 20-22% of privately insured spending in California acute care settings.<ref name="pmid16284038">{{cite journal |author=Kahn JG, Kronick R, Kreger M, Gans DN |title=The cost of health insurance administration in California: estimates for insurers, physicians, and hospitals |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=1629–39 |year=2005 |pmid=16284038 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.6.1629 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16284038 |accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref>

=== Third-party payment problem and consumer-driven insurance ===
Most Americans pay for medical services largely through insurance, and this can distort the incentives of consumers since the consumer pays only a portion of the ultimate cost directly.<ref name=just/> The lack of price information on medical services can also distort incentives.<ref name=just/> The insurance which pays on behalf of insureds negotiate with medical providers, sometimes using government-established prices such as Medicaid billing rates as a reference point.<ref name=just/> This reasoning has led for calls to reform the insurance system to create a [[consumer-driven health care]] system whereby consumers pay more out-of-pocket.<ref name="Scandlen2005">{{cite journal| author=Scandlen G| title=Consumer-driven health care: just a tweak or a revolution? | journal=Health Aff (Millwood) | year= 2005 | volume= 24 | issue= 6 | pages= 1554–8 | pmid=16284028 | doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.6.1554 | pmc= | url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/24/6/1554.full  }}</ref> In 2003, the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] was passed, which encourages consumers to have a [[high-deductible health plan]] and a [[health savings account]].

===Overall costs===
The cost impact of the existing mixed public-private system is subject to debate. The United States spends more as a percentage of GDP than similar countries, and this can be explained either through higher prices for services themselves, higher costs to administer the system, or more utilization of these services (for example, due to the United States having a more sickly population), or to a combination of these elements.<ref name="Marmoretal2009">{{cite journal| author=Marmor T, Oberlander J, White J| title=The Obama administration's options for health care cost control: hope versus reality | journal=Ann Intern Med | year= 2009 | volume= 150 | issue= 7 | pages= 485–9 | pmid=19258549 | doi= | pmc= | url=}}[http://www.annals.org/content/150/7/485.full Free full-text].</ref>

Free-market advocates claim that the health care system is "dysfunctional" because the system of third-party payments from insurers removes the patient as a major participant in the financial and medical choices that affect costs. Because government intervention has expanded insurance availability through programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, this has exacerbated the problem.<ref>Liebowitz, Stan [http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa211.html Policy Analysis: Why Health Care Costs So Much], Cato Institute, June 23, 1994</ref> According to a study paid for by [[America's Health Insurance Plans]] (a Washington lobbyist for the health insurance industry) and carried out by PriceWaterhouseCoopers, increased utilization is the primary driver of rising health care costs in the U.S.<ref name="PWC">[http://www.ahipbelieves.com/media/The%20Factors%20Fueling%20Rising%20Healthcare%20Costs.pdf The Factors Fueling Rising Healthcare Costs 2006], PriceWaterhouseCoopers for America's Health Insurance Plans, 2006. Retrieved 2007-10-08.</ref>  The study cites numerous causes of increased utilization, including rising consumer demand, new treatments, more intensive diagnostic testing, lifestyle factors, the movement to broader-access plans, and higher-priced technologies.<ref name="PWC"/> The study also mentions [[cost-shifting]] from government programs to private payers. Low reimbursement rates for Medicare and Medicaid have increased cost-shifting pressures on hospitals and doctors, who charge higher rates for the same services to private payers, which eventually affects health insurance rates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/0612/0612.costshift.html |title=Confronting The Medicare Cost Shift |accessdate=2007-06-28 |work=Managed Care Magazine}}</ref>

Health care costs rising far faster than inflation have been a major driver for [[health care reform in the United States]].

In March 2010, Massachusetts released a report on the cost drivers which it called "unique in the nation".<ref name=MassCostTrends>[http://www.mass.gov/dhcfp/costtrends Health Care Cost Trends]. Massachusetts Office of Health and Human Services. See [http://www.mass.gov/Eeohhs2/docs/dhcfp/cost_trend_docs/final_report_docs/appendix_b_ag_report.pdf Appendix B: Preliminary Report of the Massachusetts Attorney General (PDF)], pp. 1-2, for quote and summary.</ref> The report noted that providers and insurers negotiate privately, and therefore the prices can vary between providers and insurers for the same services, and it found that the variation in prices did not vary based on quality of care but rather on market leverage; the report also found that price increases rather than increased utilization explained the spending increases in the past several years.<ref name=MassCostTrends/>

===Equity===

====Coverage====
Enrollment rules in private and governmental programs result in millions of Americans going without health care coverage, including [[children]]. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that 45.7&nbsp;million Americans (15.3% of the total population) had no health insurance coverage in 2007.<ref name="Census 2007" /> However, statistics regarding the insured population are difficult to pinpoint for a number of factors, with the Census Bureau writing that "health insurance coverage is likely to be underreported".[http://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p60-238.pdf]  Further, such statistics do not provide insight into the reason a given person might be uninsured.  For example, studies have shown that approximately one third of this 45.7 million person population of uninsured persons is actually eligible for government insurance programmes such as Medicaid/Medicare, but has elected not to enroll.  The largest proportion of the population of uninsured Americans is persons earning in excess of $50,000 per annum, with those earning over $75,000 p.a. comprising the fastest-growing segment of the uninsured population.   US Citizens who earn too much money to qualify for government assistance with insurance programs but who do not earn enough to purchase a private health insurance plan make up approxmiately 2.7% percent of the total US population (8.2 million of approximately 300 million total population, by 2003 figures).[http://spectator.org/archives/2009/03/20/the-myth-of-the-46-million]

Some states (like [[California]]) do offer insurance coverage for children of low income families, but not for adults; other states do not offer such coverage at all, and so, both parent and child are caught in the notorious coverage "gap."
Although [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act|EMTALA]]<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/casecode/uscodes/42/chapters/7/subchapters/xviii/parts/e/sections/section_1395dd.html Text of EMTALA] on [[FindLaw]]</ref>  certainly keeps alive many working-class people who are badly injured, the 1986 law neither requires the provision of preventive or rehabilitative care, nor subsidizes such care, and it does nothing about the difficulties in the American mental health system.

Coverage gaps also occur among the insured population. [[Johns Hopkins University]] professor Vicente Navarro stated in 2003, "the problem does not end here, with the [[uninsured]]. An even larger problem is the [[underinsured]]" and "The most credible estimate of the number of people in the United States who have died because of lack of medical care was provided by a study carried out by [[Harvard Medical School]] Professors Himmelstein and Woolhandler (''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' 336, no. 11, 1997). They concluded that almost 100,000 people died in the United States each year because of lack of needed care."<ref name="Navarro">[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0903navarro.htm The Inhuman State of U.S. Health Care], ''Monthly Review'', Vicente Navarro, September 2003. Retrieved 2009-09-10</ref> Another study by the [[Commonwealth Fund]] published in ''Health Affairs'' estimated that 16&nbsp;million U.S. adults were underinsured in 2003. The study defined underinsurance as characterized by at least one of the following conditions: annual out-of-pocket medical expenses totaling 10% or more of income, or 5% or more among adults with incomes below 200% of the [[poverty line|federal poverty level]]; or health plan deductibles equaling or exceeding 5% of income. The underinsured were significantly more likely than those with adequate insurance to forgo health care, report financial stress because of medical bills, and experience coverage gaps for such items as prescription drugs. The study found that underinsurance disproportionately affects those with lower incomes&mdash;73% of the underinsured in the study population had annual incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level.<ref>{{cite journal | coauthors = Cathy Schoen, M.S., Michelle M.

Coverage gaps and affordability also surfaced in a 2007 international comparison by the Commonwealth Fund. Among adults surveyed in the U.S., 37% reported that they had foregone needed medical care in the previous year because of cost; either skipping medications, avoiding seeing a doctor when sick, or avoiding other recommended care. The rate was even higher&mdash; 42%&mdash;among those with chronic conditions. The study reported that these rates were well above those found in the other six countries surveyed: Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the UK.<ref>{{cite journal | coauthors = Cathy Schoen, Robin Osborn, Michelle M.

====Mental health====
A lack of mental health coverage for Americans bears significant ramifications to the [[Economy of the United States|U.S. economy]] and social system. A report by the [[Surgeon General of the United States|U.S. Surgeon General]] found that mental illnesses are the second leading cause of [[disability]] in the nation and affect 20% of all Americans.<ref name="SurGen">{{cite web |url=http://www.cartercenter.org/health/mental_health/index.html |title=The Carter Center Mental Health Program: Combating the Stigma of Mental Illness |accessdate=2008-07-30|publisher=The Carter Center}}</ref>  It is estimated that less than half of all people with mental illnesses receive treatment (or specifically, an ongoing, much needed, and managed care; where meds alone, can not easily remove mental conditions, but may only help) due to factors such as stigma and lack of access to care.<ref name="WeissWP">{{cite news |first=Rick |last=Weiss |title=Study: U.S. Leads In Mental Illness, Lags in Treatment |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/06/AR2005060601651.html |work=The Washington Post |date=2005-06-07 |accessdate=2008-07-30 }}</ref> 

The Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 mandates that group health plans provide mental health and substance-related disorder benefits that are at least equivalent to benefits offered for medical and surgical procedures. The legislation renews and expands provisions of the [[Mental Health Parity Act|Mental Health Parity Act of 1996]]. The law requires financial equity for annual and lifetime mental health benefits, and compels parity in treatment limits and expands all equity provisions to addiction services. Up to 2008 insurance companies used loopholes and, though providing financial equity, they often worked around the law by applying unequal co-payments or setting limits on the number of days spent in in-patient or out-patient treatment facilities.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/06/washington/06health.html?_r=1 |title=House Approves Bill on Mental Health Parity |accessdate=2009-07-29|work=The New York Times | first=Robert | last=Pear | date=March 6, 2008}}</ref>

====Medical underwriting and the uninsurable====
In most states in the U.S., people seeking to purchase health insurance directly must undergo [[medical underwriting]]. Insurance companies seeking to mitigate the problem of [[adverse selection]] and manage their risk pools screen applicants for pre-existing conditions. Insurers reject many applicants or quote increased rates for those with pre-existing conditions. Diseases that can make an individual uninsurable include serious conditions, such as [[arthritis]], [[cancer]], and [[heart disease]], but also such common ailments as acne, being 20&nbsp;pounds over or under weight, and old sports injuries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/articles/070820/20preconditions.b1.htm |title=The Untouchables|accessdate=2007-10-27 |last=Andrews |first=Michelle |date=2007-08-07 |work=Health |publisher=U.S. News and World Report}}</ref> An estimated 5&nbsp;million of those without health insurance are considered "uninsurable" because of pre-existing conditions.<ref name="Bloomberg">{{cite news |first=Aliza |last=Marcus |title=Baby Kendra's $300,000 Bill Pains Insurers, Inspires Candidates  |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a4BEIIi_OauQ |work= |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=2008-05-07 |accessdate=2008-05-10 }}</ref> 

Proponents of medical underwriting argue that it ensures that individual health insurance premiums are kept as low as possible.<ref>[http://www.actuary.org/pdf/health/risk.pdf "Risk Classification in Individually Purchased Voluntary Medical Expense Insurance"], [[American Academy of Actuaries]], (February 1999)</ref> Critics of medical underwriting believe that it unfairly prevents people with relatively minor and treatable pre-existing conditions from obtaining health insurance.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/05/23/cbsnews_investigates/main2843007.shtml |title=The "Uninsurables" |accessdate=2007-06-27 |work=CBS News | date=May 23, 2007}}</ref> 

One large industry survey found that 13% of applicants for individual health insurance who went through medical underwriting were denied coverage in 2004.

Public spending is highly correlated with age; average per capita public spending for seniors was more than five times that for children ($6,921 versus $1,225).  Average public spending for non-Hispanic blacks ($2,973) was slightly higher than that for whites ($2,675), while spending for Hispanics ($1,967) was significantly lower than the population average ($2,612).  Total public spending is also strongly correlated with self-reported health status ($13,770 for those reporting "poor" health versus $1,279 for those reporting "excellent" health).<ref name="content.healthaffairs.org"/> Seniors comprise 13% of the population but take 1/3 of all prescription drugs.

There is a great deal of research into inequalities in health care. In some cases these inequalities are caused by income disparities that result in lack of health insurance and other barriers to receiving services.<ref>[http://www.kff.org/uninsured/7705.cfm "How Trends in the Health Care System Affect Low-Income Adults: Identifying Access Problems and Financial Burdens"], Issue Brief: Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, December 21, 2007.

== Drug efficacy and safety ==
{{See also|Regulation of therapeutic goods in the United States}}
The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)<ref>http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/WhatFDARegulates/default.htm</ref> is the primary institution tasked with the safety and effectiveness of human and veterinary drugs. It also is responsible for making sure drug information is accurately and informatively presented to the public. The FDA reviews and approves products and establishes [[List of pharmaceutical compound number prefixes|drug labeling]], drug standards, and medical device manufacturing standards. It sets performance standards for radiation and ultrasonic equipment.

One of the more contentious issues related to drug safety is immunity from prosecution. In 2004, the FDA reversed a federal policy, arguing that FDA premarket approval overrides most claims for damages under state law for medical devices. In 2008 this was confirmed by the Supreme Court in [[Riegel v. Medtronic]].<ref>http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp0802108</ref>  

On 30 June 2006, an FDA ruling went into effect extending protection from lawsuits to pharmaceutical manufacturers, even if it was found that they submitted fraudulent clinical trial data to the FDA in their quest for approval. This left consumers who experience serious health consequences from drug use with little recourse. In 2007, opposition was raised in the Congressional House to the FDA ruling, but the Senate upheld the status quo.  On 4 March 2009, an important U.S. Supreme Court decision was handed down. In [[Wyeth v. Levine]], the court asserted that state-level rights of action could not be pre-empted by federal immunity and could provide "appropriate relief for injured consumers."<ref>http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2008/2008_06_1249/</ref> In June 2009, under the [[Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act]], [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] [[Kathleen Sebelius]] signed an order extending protection to vaccine makers and federal officials from prosecution during a declared health emergency related to the administration of the [[swine flu vaccine]].<ref>{{USFedReg|74|30294}}, [[Federal Register]]: June 25, 2009 (Volume 74, Number 121), pp. 30294–30297.</ref><ref>[http://www.flu.gov/professional/federal/vaccineliability.html Coverage Under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act for H1N1 Vaccination] Flu.gov, retrieved 11 November 2009</ref>

===Impact of drug companies===
The United States is one of two countries in the world that allows [[direct-to-consumer advertising]] of prescription drugs. Critics note that drug ads costs money which they believe have raised the overall price of drugs.<ref>http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7481/5</ref>

When health care legislation was being written in 2009, the drug companies were asked to support the legislation in return for not allowing importation of drugs from foreign countries.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/16/nation/la-na-health-senate16-2009dec16 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Senate healthcare bill advances with rejection of imported drugs | first1=Janet | last1=Hook | first2=Noam N. | last2=Levey | date=December 16, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref><!---so what?

==Political issues==

===Prescription drug prices===
{{sync|Prescription drug prices in the United States}}
{{Main|Prescription drug prices in the United States}}
During the 1990s, the price of [[prescription drugs]] became a major issue in American politics as the prices of many new drugs increased exponentially, and many citizens discovered that neither the government nor their insurer would cover the cost of such drugs. Per capita, the U.S. spends more on pharmaceuticals than any other country. National expenditures on pharmaceuticals accounted for  12.9% of total health care costs, compared to an [[OECD]] average of 17.7% (2003 figures).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/15/23/34970246.pdf |format=PDF |title=OECD Health Data, How Does the United States Compare |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] |accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref> Some 25% of out-of-pocket spending by individuals is for prescription drugs.<ref name="pmid15451969">{{cite journal |author=Heffler S, Smith S, Keehan S, Clemens MK, Zezza M, Truffer C |title=Health spending projections through 2013 |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=Suppl Web Exclusives |issue= |pages=W4–79–93, See especially exhibit 5 |year=2004 |pmid=15451969 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.w4.79 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15451969}}</ref>

The United States government has taken the position (through the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]]) that U.S. drug prices are rising because U.S. consumers are effectively subsidizing costs which drug companies cannot recover from consumers in other countries (because many other countries use their bulk-purchasing power to aggressively negotiate drug prices).<ref>See the summary of the official U.S. position in the [http://www.ustr.gov/assets/Trade_Sectors/Intellectual_Property/Special_301_Public_Submissions_2008/asset_upload_file109_14495.pdf "Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) Special 301 Submission of 2008"]{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}, 11 February 2008, 10–20.</ref> The U.S. position (consistent with the primary lobbying position of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America) is that the governments of such countries are [[free rider problem|free riding]] on the backs of U.S. consumers.  Such governments should either deregulate their markets, or raise their domestic taxes in order to fairly compensate U.S. consumers by directly remitting the difference (between what the companies would earn in an open market versus what they are earning now) to drug companies or to the U.S. government. In turn, pharmaceutical companies would be able to continue to produce innovative pharmaceuticals while lowering prices for U.S. consumers. Currently, the U.S., as a purchaser of pharmaceuticals, negotiates some drug prices but is forbidden by law from negotiating drug prices for the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program due to the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] passed in 2003. Democrats have charged that the purpose of this provision is merely to allow the pharmaceutical industry to profiteer off of the Medicare program, which is already in imminent danger of becoming financially insolvent.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/06/business/06drug.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=As Drug Prices Climb, Democrats Find Fault With Medicare Plan | first=Alex | last=Berenson | date=November 6, 2006 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>

===Debate===
{{Main|Health care reform in the United States}}

A poll released in March 2008 by the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] and [[Harris Interactive]] found that Americans are divided in their views of the U.S. health system, and that there are significant differences by political affiliation.  When asked whether the U.S. has the best health care system or if other countries have better systems, 45% said that the U.S. system was best and 39% said that other countries' systems are better.  Belief that the U.S. system is best was highest among Republicans (68%), lower among independents (40%), and lowest among Democrats (32%).  Over half of Democrats (56%) said they would be more likely to support a presidential candidate who advocates making the U.S. system more like those of other countries; 37% of independents and 19% of Republicans said they would be more likely to support such a candidate.  45% of Republicans said that they would be less likely to support such a candidate, compared to 17% of independents and 7% of Democrats.<ref>[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2008-releases/republicans-democrats-disagree-us-health-care-system.html "Most Republicans Think the U.S. Health Care System is the Best in the World.

A 2004 [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) report said: "The United States is among the few industrialized nations in the world that ''does not guarantee access'' to health care for its population."<ref name="IOM 2004"/> There is currently an ongoing political debate centering around questions of access, efficiency, quality, and sustainability. Whether a government-mandated system of universal health care should be implemented in the U.S. remains a hotly debated political topic, with Americans divided along [[Political party|party]] lines in their views of the U.S. health system and what should be done to improve it. Those in favor of [[universal health care]] argue that the large number of uninsured Americans creates direct and hidden costs shared by all, and that extending coverage to all would lower costs and improve quality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2004/Insuring-Americas-Health-Principles-and-Recommendations.aspx |title=Insuring America's Health: Principles and Recommendations |accessdate=2007-10-27 |work=[[Institute of Medicine]] of the National Academies }}</ref> [[Cato Institute]] Senior Fellow Alan Reynolds argues that people should be free to opt out of health insurance, citing a study by Economists Craig Perry and Harvey Rosen that found "the lack of health insurance among the self-employed does not affect their health.

Advocates for [[single-payer health care]] often point to other countries, where national government-funded systems produce better health outcomes at lower cost.  Opponents deride this type of system as "[[socialized medicine]]", and it has not been one of the favored reform options by Congress or the President in both the Clinton and Obama reform efforts.<ref>http://spectator.org/archives/2009/04/20/socialized-medicine-on-modern</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/08/what-is-socialized-medicine-a-taxonomy-of-health-care-systems/ | work=The New York Times | title=What Is 'Socialized Medicine'?: A Taxonomy of Health Care Systems | first=Uwe E. | last=Reinhardt | date=May 8, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> 
It has been pointed out that [[socialized medicine]] is a system in which the government owns the means of providing medicine. Britain is an example of socialized system, as, in America, is the [[Veterans Health Administration]]. Medicare is an example of a mostly single-payer system, as is France. Both of these systems have private insurers to choose from, but the government is the dominant purchaser.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/06/health_reform_for_beginners_th_1.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Health Reform for Beginners: The Difference Between Socialized Medicine, Single-Payer Health Care, and What We'll Be Getting | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>

The legislation, known as Act 48, establishes health care in the state as a "human right" and lays the responsibility on the state to provide a health care system which best meets the needs of the citizens of Vermont. The state is currently in the studying phase of how best to implement this system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Health Insurance Coverage of Immigrants==
Of the 26.2 million foreign immigrants living in the US in 1998, 62.9% were noncitizens.  In 1997, 34.3% of noncitizens living in America did not have health insurance coverage opposed to the 14.2% of native-born Americans who do not have health insurance coverage.  Among those immigrants who became citizens, 18.5% were uninsured, as opposed to noncitizens, who are 43.6% uninsured.  In each age and income group, immigrants are less likely to have health insurance.<ref>http://ajph.aphapublications.org/cgi/reprint/90/6/917.pdf</ref>
