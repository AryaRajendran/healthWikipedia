'''Popliteal pterygium syndrome''' (PPS) is an [[heredity|inherited]] condition affecting the [[face]], [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]], and [[genitalia]].<ref>{{cite book |author=James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders |year=2005 |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |page=577 |edition=10th}}</ref>  The [[syndrome]] goes by a number of names including the ''popliteal web syndrome'' and, more inclusively, the ''facio-genito-popliteal syndrome''.  The term PPS was coined by Gorlin ''[[et al.]].'' in 1968 on the basis of the most unusual [[Birth defect|anomaly]], the [[popliteal]] [[pterygium]] (a web behind the [[knee]]).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gorlin RJ, Sedano HO, Cervenka J |title=Popliteal pterygium syndrome . A syndrome comprising cleft lip-palate, popliteal and intercrural pterygia, digital and genital anomalies |journal=Pediatrics |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=503–9 |year=1968 |month=February |pmid=4384166 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/41/2/503}}</ref>

== Clinical features ==
[[Medical sign|Clinical expressions]] of PPS are highly variable, but include the following:<ref>[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5001 medterms.com]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Parikh SN, Crawford AH, Do TT, Roy DR |title=Popliteal pterygium syndrome: implications for orthopaedic management |journal=J Pediatr Orthop B |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=197–201 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15083121 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1060-152X&volume=13&issue=3&spage=197}}</ref>

* [[Limb (anatomy)|Limb]] findings: an extensive web running from behind the knee down to the [[heel]] (90%), malformed [[toenail]]s, and webbed toes.
* [[face|Facial]] findings: [[cleft palate]] with or without cleft lip (75%), pits in the lower [[lip]] (40%), and fibrous bands in the [[mouth]] known as [[syngnathia]] (25%).
* [[genitalia|Genital]] findings (50%): [[hypoplasia]] of the [[labia majora]], malformation of the [[scrotum]], and [[cryptorchidism]].

== Epidemiology ==

The [[diagnosis]] of PPS has been made in several [[ethnicity|ethnic]] groups, including [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]], [[Japan]]ese, and [[negroid|sub-Saharan African]].  Males and females are equally likely to suffer from the syndrome.  Since the disorder is very rare, its incidence rate is difficult to estimate, but is less than 1 in 10,000.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Froster-Iskenius UG |title=Popliteal pterygium syndrome |journal=J. Med. Genet. |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=320–6 |year=1990 |month=May |pmid=2352260 |pmc=1017084 |url=http://jmg.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=2352260 |doi=10.1136/jmg.27.5.320}}</ref>

== Genetics ==
[[Image:Autosomal dominant - en.svg|thumb|right|Popliteal pterygium syndrome is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] pattern.]]
The [[locus (genetics)|genetic locus]] for PPS was localized to [[chromosome 1]] in 1999.
The disorder is inherited in an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] manner and is due to [[mutation]] of the [[IRF6]] [[gene]].  Most reported cases are sporadic; advanced parental [[senescence|age]] is found in a number of these cases, suggesting new mutations.

The term PPS has also been used for two rare autosomal [[recessive]]ly inherited conditions: ''Lethal PPS'' and ''PPS with Ectodermal Dysplasia''.  Although both conditions feature a cleft lip/palate, [[syngnathia]], and [[popliteal]] [[pterygium]], they are clinically distinguishable from the autosomal dominant case.  Lethal PPS is differentiated by [[microcephaly]], [[corneal]] [[aplasia]], [[ectropion]], bony fusions, [[hypoplasia|hypoplastic]] [[Human nose|nose]] and absent [[thumb]]s, while PPS with Ectodermal Dysplasia is differentiated by [[wool]]ly [[hair]], brittle [[finger nail|nail]]s, [[ectoderm]]al anomalies, and fissure of the [[sacral]] [[vertebra]]e.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cardoso ER, Hawary MB, Mahmud S |title=A recessively inherited non-lethal form of popliteal pterygium syndrome |journal=Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=138–40 |year=1998 |month=April |pmid=9643601 }}</ref>

== Relationship to Van der Woude syndrome ==

[[Van der Woude syndrome]] (VDWS) and popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS) are [[allele|allelic]] variants of the same condition; that is, they are caused by different mutations of the same gene.  PPS includes all the features of VDWS, plus popliteal pterygium, syngnathia, distinct toe/nail abnormality, [[syndactyly]], and genito-[[urinary]] malformations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wong FK, Hagg U |title=An update on the aetiology of orofacial clefts |journal=Hong Kong Med J |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=331–6 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=15479962 |url=http://www.hkmj.org/abstracts/v10n5/331.htm}}</ref>
