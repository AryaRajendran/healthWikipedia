Vajaradul established the [[Bangkok Biomaterial Center]] in [[Siriraj Hospital]] in 1984, and Thailand became the tissue banking forerunner of the region. 

The ''Pan-Asiatic Tissue Banking Association'' was first proposed in 1985 during the [[Western Pacific Orthopaedic Association]] Congress in [[Bangkok, Thailand]] by Vajaradul, [[Alain Patel]] of [[France]] and [[Norberto Agcaoili]] of [[the Philippines]], with its [[wikt:secretariat|Secretariat]] at Bangkok Biomaterial Center. In October 1988, during the Third International Conference on Locomotor Tissue Bank in Bangkok, the new association was born and renamed [[Asia-Pacific Association of Surgical Tissue Banking]] (APASTB). The founding members included Vajaradul and [[Aziz Nather]], who became the President and First Vice-President respectively, a post he served to from 1988 to 1990. 

Vajaradul is a member of the National Scout Executive Board and the National Scout Council of the [[The National Scout Organization of Thailand]], as well as a member of the [[WOSM-Asia-Pacific Region|Asia Pacific Regional Scout Committee]]

In addition, Vajaradul was the Charter President of the [[Rotary Club]] of Bangkok-Banglamphu District 3350, [[Rotary International]], in 1998.
