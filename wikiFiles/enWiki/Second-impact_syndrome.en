'''Second-impact syndrome''' ('''SIS''') is a  condition in which the brain swells rapidly and catastrophically after a person suffers a second [[concussion]] before symptoms from an earlier one have subsided.  This deadly second blow may occur days, weeks or minutes after an initial concussion,<ref name="drake"/> and even the mildest [[concussion#Grades|grade of concussion]] can lead to SIS.<ref name=cantu/> The condition is often fatal, and almost everyone who is not killed is severely disabled. The cause of SIS is uncertain, but it is thought that the brain's [[arteriole]]s lose their ability to regulate their [[diameter]], and therefore lose control over [[cerebral blood flow]], causing massive [[cerebral edema]].<ref name=cantu/>

Most cases of SIS have occurred in young people, who are thought to be particularly vulnerable. Young athletes are most at risk.  In order to prevent SIS, guidelines have been established to prohibit athletes from returning to a game prematurely.  For example, professionals recommend that athletes not return to play before symptoms of an initial head injury have resolved.

Due to the very small number of recorded cases of SIS, there is doubt about whether it is a valid diagnosis. However, the syndrome is recognized by physicians.<ref name="Terrell">

==Epidemiology==
Though the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of second impact syndrome is unknown,<ref name=cdc/> the condition is rare; very few cases have been confirmed in medical literature.<ref name="drake"/>  In the 13&nbsp;year period from 1980–1993, 35 [[american football|football]]-related cases of SIS were recorded, but only 17 of these were confirmed by [[necropsy]] or [[surgery]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] to be due to SIS, and 18&nbsp;cases were found to be probably SIS-related.<ref name=cantu/> Additionally, the initial trauma commonly goes unreported, adding to the confusion about how often the syndrome occurs.<ref name=tyler/> 

By one estimate, the syndrome kills four to six people under the age of 18 per year.<ref name=bach>Bach G (2007), "[http://www.scientificadvisory.com/sportingkid.html Heads up]". ''SportingKid Magazine''. [[National Alliance for Youth Sports]].  Scientific Advisory Services, Ltd.  Retrieved on 2007-12-30.</ref>   According to the [[Centers for Disease Control]], about 1.5&nbsp;people die each year from concussion in the US; in most of these cases, the person had received  another concussion previously.<ref name=Neurosurgery>Neurosurgery Today (November 2005). [http://www.neurosurgerytoday.org/what/patient_e/concussion.asp Concussion]. Neurosurgerytoday.org. Retrieved on 2008-01-02.</ref>

In part due to the poor documentation of the initial injury and continuing symptoms in recorded cases,<ref name="bernhardt"/> some professionals think that the condition is over-diagnosed,<ref name="drake"/> and some doubt the validity of the diagnosis altogether.<ref name=Nugent>

===Risks===
Second-impact syndrome shares all the risk factors of concussion; that is, those who are at increased risk for concussion are also at higher risk for SIS.  Thus, people who participate in sports such as [[boxing]], [[Association football|soccer]], [[gridiron football]], [[baseball]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[basketball]], [[ice hockey]], [[pro wrestling]], and [[skiing]] (especially [[Alpine skiing|Alpine]]) are at increased risk.<ref name=Neurosurgery/>  The condition most commonly occurs in American football.<ref name=MacReady/>

Second-impact syndrome disproportionately affects teenagers. All documented cases occurred in people younger than 20 except in [[boxing]].<ref name="Team"/> As of 2000, the syndrome had never been reported in the medical literature in children younger than adolescent age.<ref name=LeBlanc/>  Young athletes have been found to be both more susceptible to concussions and more likely to get second-impact syndrome than their older counterparts.<ref name=BuzziniGuskiewicz>

Measures that prevent head injuries in general also prevent SIS.  Thus athletes are advised to use protective gear such as helmets,<ref name=drake/> though helmets do not entirely prevent the syndrome.<ref name=nyt/>

In 2005, Preston Plevretes, a football player for LaSalle University, had his life changed forever by second-impact syndrome.  After undergoing a head-to-head hit at football practice, a university doctor diagnosed Plevretes with a concussion and two days later was told he was allowed to resume play.  Three games after returning Plevretes sustained another concussion resulting in second-impact syndrome.  He was rushed to the hospital where doctors cut the right side of his skull.  Five years after the injury, he still struggles to do everyday activities.  Because of Plevretes, the NCAA revised concussion guidelines.  The NCAA strongly urges schools to have a concussion management plan.  They also require that an athlete have clearance by a team doctor before being allowed to return.<ref>E:60. (2011, March 3).

In 2006, Zachary Lystedt, a thirteen-year-old football player, suffered a concussion during one of his games.  He shrugged off the hit and went back in the game a few plays later.  At the end of the game, he collapsed on the field.  Lystedt had second-impact syndrome. He was airlifted to a hospital where surgeons cut both sides of his skull so that the blood clot could be taken out.  He was in the hospital for months and he still has trouble doing everyday things, such as walking.  To prevent other families from going through what they went through, the Lystedt family made it their goal to make a law that athletes who are suspected of a concussion are not allowed to return to play unless he or she is cleared by a licensed physician.  The law is now effective in over thirty states.<ref>ESPN (2012, February 1). Life Changed By Concussions [Video file]. Retrieved from

By 2003, 21 cases of SIS had been reported in medical literature.<ref name=Poirier/>

==Controversy==
{{update|section|date=July 2012}}
The existence of SIS is in question and is somewhat controversial.<ref name="Lovell08"/> The sudden collapse seen in sufferers may be due to a type of cerebral [[edema]] that can follow an initial impact in children and teenagers, rather than to SIS.<ref name=Nugent/>  This type of edema, referred to as '[[diffuse cerebral swelling]]' may be the real reason for the collapse which young people sometimes experience and which is commonly thought to be due to SIS.<ref name=McCrory>
{{cite journal|author=McCrory P |year=2001 |title=Does second impact syndrome exist? |journal=Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=144–149 |pmid=11495318|doi=10.1097/00042752-200107000-00004

</ref>  Those who doubt the validity of the diagnosis cite the finding that diffuse cerebral swelling is more common in children and adolescents as an explanation for the greater frequency of SIS diagnoses in young people.<ref name=McCrory/> One group found that of 17 previously identified cases of SIS, only 5 met their diagnostic criteria for the syndrome,<ref name=McCrory98/> with some cases not clearly involving a second impact.<ref name=Nugent/> They found that diagnoses of SIS were frequently based on bystander accounts of previous injuries, which they showed to be unreliable.<ref name=MacReady/> Teammates of players who are thought to have SIS may overreport the initial concussion, giving the appearance of a greater number of second impacts than actually exist.<ref name=McCrory98>
{{cite journal |author=McCrory PR, Berkovic SF |title=Second impact syndrome |journal=Neurology |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=677–83 |year=1998 |pmid=9521255 |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/full/50/3/677?ijkey=317d3c61411150753e892db5b5a8f6ed42166b5f

</ref> Thus critics argue that the small number of reported cases leaves the question of whether SIS really causes the brain to swell catastrophically unanswered.<ref name=shaffrey/> 

Whether a second impact is really involved in the diffuse cerebral swelling that occurs on rare occasions after a mild [[traumatic brain injury]] is controversial, but experts agree that such catastrophic brain swelling does occur after a very a small number of mild brain injuries and that young age is associated with increased risk.<ref name=kirk/> It is also agreed that some people may be particularly vulnerable to catastrophic brain swelling as the result of multiple head injuries.<ref name=MacReady/>
