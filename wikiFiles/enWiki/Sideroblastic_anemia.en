'''Sideroblastic anemia''' or '''sideroachrestic anemia''' is a disease in which the bone marrow produces ringed sideroblasts rather than healthy [[red blood cell]]s (erythrocytes).<ref name="pmid18698088">{{cite journal |author=Caudill JS, Imran H, Porcher JC, Steensma DP |title=Congenital sideroblastic anemia associated with germline polymorphisms reducing expression of FECH |journal=Haematologica |volume=93 |issue=10 |pages=1582–4 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18698088 |doi=10.3324/haematol.12597 |url=http://www.haematologica.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18698088}}</ref>  It may be caused either by a [[genetic disorder]] or indirectly as part of [[myelodysplastic syndrome]],<ref name="titleSideroblastic Anemias: Anemias Caused by Deficient Erythropoiesis: Merck Manual Professional">{{MerckManual|11|130|c||Sideroblastic Anemias: Anemias Caused by Deficient Erythropoiesis}}</ref> which can evolve into [[hematological malignancy|hematological malignancies]] (especially [[acute myelogenous leukemia]]). In sideroblastic anemia, the body has iron available but cannot incorporate it into [[hemoglobin]], which red blood cells need to transport oxygen efficiently. 

'''Sideroblasts''' are atypical, abnormal [[nucleated]] [[erythroblast]]s (precursors to mature red blood cells) with granules of iron accumulated in perinuclear [[mitochondria]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|seven/000096780|Sideroblast}}</ref>  Sideroblasts are seen in aspirates of [[bone marrow]].

'''Ring sideroblasts''' are named so because of the arrangement of the iron granules in a ring form around the nucleus. However it does not take the ring to be complete in order to count a cell as a ring sideroblast. According to the 2008 WHO classification of the tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, it only needs 5 or more iron granules encircling one third or more of the nucleus.<ref>Diagnosis and classification of myelodysplastic syndrome: International Working Group on Morphology of myelodysplastic syndrome (IWGM-MDS) consensus proposals for the definition and enumeration of myeloblasts and ring sideroblasts Haematologica November 2008 93: 1712-1717; published ahead of print October 6, 2008, doi:10.3324/haematol.13405 http://www.haematologica.org/content/93/11/1712.full</ref>

The WHO International Working Group on Morphology of MDS (IWGM-MDS) defined three types of sideroblasts: 
#'''Type 1 sideroblasts''': fewer than 5 siderotic granules in the cytoplasm
#'''Type 2 sideroblasts''': 5 or more siderotic granules, but not in a perinuclear distribution
#'''Type 3 or ring sideroblasts''': 5 or more granules in a perinuclear position, surrounding the nucleus or encompassing at least one third of the nuclear circumference.

==Classification==
Sideroblastic anemia is typically divided into subtypes based on its cause.  
* Hereditary or congenital sideroblastic anemia may be X-linked<ref>{{NLM|xlinkedsideroblasticanemia|X-linked sideroblastic anemia}}</ref> or autosomal.

* Acquired, or secondary, sideroblastic anemia develops after birth and is divided according to its cause.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of sideroblastic anemia include skin paleness, fatigue, dizziness, and enlarged spleen and liver. Heart disease, liver damage, and kidney failure can result from iron buildup in these organs.<ref>[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=xlinkedsideroblasticanemia Genetics Home Reference: Genetic Conditions > X-linked sideroblastic anemia] Reviewed October 2006. Retrieved on 5 Mars, 2009</ref>

==Causes==
By far the most common cause of sideroblastic anemia is excessive alcohol use. In this and other cases, the primary [[pathophysiology]] of sideroblastic anemia is failure to completely form [[heme]] molecules, whose biosynthesis takes place partly in the [[mitochondrion]].  This leads to deposits of iron in the [[mitochondria]] that form a ring around the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] of the developing [[red blood cell]].  Sometimes the disorder represents a stage in evolution of a generalized bone marrow disorder that may ultimately terminate in acute leukemia.

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Ring Sideroblast smear 2010-01-13.JPG|thumb|right|Bone marrow aspirate: ring sideroblasts]]
Ringed sideroblasts are seen in the bone marrow.

The anemia is moderate to severe and dimorphic with marked [[anisocytosis]] and [[poikilocytosis]]. [[Basophilic stippling]] is marked and target cells are common. [[Pappenheimer bodies]] are present. The [[Mean corpuscular volume|MCV]] is decreased (i.e., a [[microcytic anemia]]). The [[Red blood cell distribution width|RDW]] is increased with the [[red blood cell]] histogram shifted to the left. [[Leukocyte]]s and [[platelet]]s are normal. Bone marrow shows erythroid hyperplasia with a maturation arrest. 

In excess of 40% of the developing erythrocytes are ringed sideroblasts. Serum iron, percentage saturation and [[ferritin]] are increased. The [[Total iron-binding capacity|TIBC]] is normal to decreased. Stainable marrow hemosiderin is increased.

==Laboratory findings==
* Increased [[ferritin]] levels
* Normal [[total iron-binding capacity]]
* [[Hematocrit]] of about 20-30%
* Serum Iron: High
* High [[transferrin saturation]]
* The [[mean corpuscular volume]] or MCV is usually normal or low.
* With [[lead poisoning]], see coarse basophilic stippling of red blood cells on peripheral blood smear
* Specific test: Prussian Blue stain of RBC in marrow. Shows ringed sideroblasts.
*can also cause microcytic hypochromic anemia.

==Treatment==
Occasionally, the anemia is so severe that support with transfusion is required. These patients usually do not respond to [[erythropoietin]] therapy.<ref>{{cite book |author=Papadakis, Maxine A.; Tierney, Lawrence M.; McPhee, Stephen J. |title=Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment, 2006 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location= |year=2005 |pages= |chapter=Sideroblastic Anemia |isbn=0-07-145410-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Some cases have been reported that the anemia is reversed or heme level is improved through use of moderate to high doses of pyrodoxine (Vitamin B<sub>6</sub>). In severe cases of SBA, bone marrow transplant is also an option with limited information about the success rate. Some cases are listed on MedLine and various other medical sites. In the case of [[isoniazid]]-induced sideroblastic anemia, the addition of B<sub>6</sub> is sufficient to correct the anemia. [[Desferrioxamine]] is used to treat iron overload from transfusions.
Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) is the last possible treatment.

==Course and prognosis==

Sideroblastic anemias are often described as responsive or non responsive in terms of increased Hb level to pharmacological doses of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>.

1- Hereditary-80% are responsive, though the hematology does not revert completely to normal.

2- Primary acquired-40% are responsive, but the response may be slight and is usually suboptimal.

3- Secondary-60% are responsive, the response also depending on the effectiveness of the treatment of associated conditions.

Severe refractory sideroblastic anemias requiring regular transfusions and/or leukemic transformation (5-10%) significantly reduce life expectancy.
