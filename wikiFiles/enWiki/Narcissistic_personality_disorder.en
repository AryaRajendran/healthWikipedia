'''Narcissistic personality disorder''' ('''NPD''') is a [[personality disorder]]<ref name="DSM-IV-TR">[http://behavenet.com/narcissistic-personality-disorder Narcissistic personality disorder]&nbsp;– [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000)</ref> in which the individual is described as being excessively preoccupied with issues of personal adequacy, [[Power (social)|power]], prestige and [[vanity]].

==History==
The [[history of narcissism|use of the term "narcissism"]] to describe excessive vanity and self-centeredness predates by many years the modern medical classification of narcissistic personality disorder. The condition was named after a mythological Greek youth named [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] who became infatuated with his own reflection in a lake. He did not realize at first that it was his own reflection, but when he did, he died out of grievance for having fallen in love with someone that did not exist outside of himself. Although this may not be the only version of the myth, it is one of the more popular ones.

The term "narcissistic personality structure" was introduced by [[Otto Kernberg|Kernberg]] in 1967<ref>Kernberg O, Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism, 1967</ref> and "narcissistic personality disorder" first proposed by [[Heinz Kohut]] in 1968.<ref>Kohut H The Psychoanalytic Treatment of Narcissistic Personality Disorders: Outline of a Systematic Approach, 1968</ref>

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of this disorder, as defined by the DSM-IV-TR include:<ref name="DSM-IV-TR">[http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/narcissisticpd.htm Narcissistic personality disorder] – [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000)</ref>

*Reacting to criticism with [[anger]], [[shame]], or [[humiliation]]
*Taking advantage of others to reach own goals
*[[exaggerate|Exaggerating]] own importance, achievements, and talents
*Imagining unrealistic [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]] of success, beauty, power, intelligence, or romance 
*Requiring constant [[Attention seeking|attention]] and [[positive reinforcement]] from others
*Becoming [[jealous]] easily
*Lacking empathy and disregarding the feelings of others
*Being obsessed with self
*Pursuing mainly [[selfish]] goals
*Trouble keeping healthy relationships
*Becoming easily hurt and rejected 
*Setting goals that are unrealistic
*Wanting "the best" of everything
*Appearing unemotional
In addition to these symptoms, the person may also display dominance, arrogance, show superiority, and seek power.<ref>Ronnigstam E. (2011). "Narcissistic personality disorder: A clinical perspective". ''Journal of Psychiatric Practice'' '''17''' (2): 89-99. {{Cite doi|10.1097/01.pra.0000396060.67150.40}}</ref> The symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder can be similar to the traits of individuals with strong self-esteem and confidence; differentiation occurs when the underlying psychological structures of these traits are considered [[pathology|pathological]]. Narcissists have such an elevated sense of self-worth that they value themselves as inherently better than others. However, they have a fragile [[self-esteem]] and cannot handle [[criticism]], and will often try to compensate for this inner fragility by belittling or disparaging others in an attempt to validate their own self-worth. It is this sadistic tendency that is characteristic of narcissism as opposed to other psychological conditions affecting level of self-worth.<ref>Narcissistic personality disorder: Symptoms – MayoClinic.com." Mayo Clinic. N.p., n.d. Web. 2 Dec. 2011. <http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/narcissistic-personality-disorder/DS00652/DSECTION=symptoms</ref>

In children, inflated self-views and grandiose feelings, which are characteristics of narcissism, are part of the normal self-development. Children typically cannot understand the difference between their actual and their ideal self, which causes an unrealistic perception of the self. After about age 8, views of the self, both positive and negative, begin to develop based on comparisons of peers, and become more realistic. Two factors that cause self-view to remain unrealistic are dysfunctional interactions with parents that can be either excessive attention or a lack thereof. The child will either compensate for lack of attention or act in terms of unrealistic self-perception.<ref name="ReferenceA">Development and Validation of the Childhood Narcissism Scale,  SANDER THOMAES,1,2 HEDY STEGGE,1 BRAD J. BUSHMAN,3,4 TJEERT OLTHOF,1 AND JAAP DENISSEN. Department of Psychology, VU University, The Netherlands Department of Psychology, Utrecht University, The Netherlands Department of Psychology, University of Michigan Department of Communication Sciences, VU University, The Netherlands</ref>

The Childhood Narcissism Scale (CNS) measurements concluded that narcissistic children seek to impress others and gain admiration but do not have any interest in creating sincere friendships.  CNS researchers have measured that childhood narcissism has become more prevalent in Western society; any types of activities that focus on overly praising the individual can raise narcissistic levels.  More research is needed to find the reasons that promote or protect against narcissism.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Causes==
The cause of this disorder is unknown, however Groopman and Cooper list the following factors identified by various researchers as possibilities:<ref name=AMN>{{Cite web | title =Narcissistic Personality Disorder | publisher=Armenian Medical Network | work =Personality Disorders – Narcissistic Personality Disorder | url=http://www.health.am/psy/narcissistic-personality-disorder/ | year = 2006 | accessdate=2007-02-14 | unused_data =Leonard C. Groopman, M.D. Arnold M. Cooper, M.D.}}</ref>
*An oversensitive temperament at birth
*Excessive admiration that is never balanced with realistic feedback
*Excessive [[praise]] for good behaviors or excessive [[criticism]] for bad behaviors in childhood
*Overindulgence and overvaluation by parents, other family members, or peers
*Being praised for perceived exceptional looks or abilities by adults
*Severe [[emotional abuse]] in childhood
*Unpredictable or unreliable caregiving from parents
*Valued by parents as a means to regulate their own [[self-esteem]]

Some narcissistic traits are common and a normal developmental phase. When these traits are compounded by a failure of the [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal environment]] and continue into adulthood, they may intensify to the point where NPD is diagnosed.<ref>Cooper AM: Narcissism in normal development, in Character Pathology. Edited by Zales M. New York, Brunner/Mazel, 1984, pp. 39–56.</ref> Some psychotherapists believe that the etiology of the disorder is, in [[Freudian]] terms, the result of [[fixation (psychology)|fixation]] to early childhood development.<ref name="Joseph Fernando 1998">Joseph Fernando, MPSY, M.D., The Etiology of Narcissistic Personality Disorder, (1998). Psychoanalytic Study of the Child, 53:141–158.</ref>

A 1994 study by Gabbard and Twemlow<ref>Gabbard, Glen O., Stuart W. Twemlow. 1994</ref>. "The Role of MotherSon Incest in The Pathogenesis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder". ''Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association'', Vol. 42, No. 1, 171–189 (1994) 

===Theories===
Pathological narcissism occurs in a spectrum of severity. In its more extreme forms, it is narcissistic personality disorder (NPD). NPD is considered to result from a person's belief that they are flawed in a way that makes them fundamentally unacceptable to others.<ref name=gol1>Golomb, Elan PhD (1992). ''Trapped in the Mirror''. New York: Morrow, pp. 19–20.</ref> This belief is held below the person's conscious awareness; such a person would, if questioned, typically deny thinking such a thing. In order to protect themselves against the intolerably painful rejection and isolation that (they imagine) would follow if others recognized their (perceived) defective nature, such people make strong attempts to control others’ views of them and behavior towards them.

Pathological narcissism can develop from an impairment in the quality of the person's relationship with their primary caregivers, usually their parents, in that the parents could not form a healthy and [[empathy|empathic]] [[Attachment theory|attachment]] to them.<ref name="Magid">{{cite book|author=Dr. Ken Magid|title=High risk children without a conscience|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/High_Risk.html?id=88C74pQcIm4C|accessdate=17 November 2012|year=1987|publisher=Bantam|isbn=0-553-05290-X|page=67}}</ref> This results in the child's perception of himself/herself as unimportant and unconnected to others. The child typically comes to believe they have some personality defect that makes them unvalued and unwanted.<ref name="Johns">{{cite book|author=Stephen M. Johnson|title=Humanizing the narcissistic style|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WxV2QgAACAAJ|accessdate=31 March 2011|date=1 May 1987|publisher=W.W. Norton|isbn=978-0-393-70037-4|page=39}}</ref>

{{Anchor|control|dsm1}}To the extent that people are pathologically narcissistic, they can be controlling, blaming, self-absorbed, intolerant of others’ views, unaware of others' needs and of the effects of their behavior on others, and insistent that others see them as they wish to be seen.<ref name= DSM1>[http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/narcissisticpd.htm full list in DSM-IV-TR, p. 717].</ref>

Narcissistic individuals use various strategies to protect the self at the expense of others. They tend to devalue, derogate and blame others, and they respond to threatening feedback with anger and hostility.<ref>Identifying and understanding the narcissistic personality   Elsa F. Ronningstam. Oxfard University Press Inc.</ref>

People who are overly narcissistic commonly feel rejected, [[humiliated]] and threatened when criticised. To protect themselves from these dangers, they often react with disdain, [[narcissistic rage|rage]], and/or defiance to any slight [[criticism]], real or imagined.<ref name=DSM2>American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association, 1994, p. 659.</ref> To avoid such situations, some narcissistic people withdraw socially and may feign modesty or humility. In cases where the narcissistic personality-disordered individual feels a lack of admiration, adulation, attention and affirmation, he or she may also manifest a desire to be feared and to be notorious ([[narcissistic supply]]).

Although individuals with NPD are often ambitious and capable, the inability to tolerate setbacks, disagreements or criticism, along with lack of empathy, make it difficult for such individuals to work cooperatively with others or to maintain long-term professional achievements.<ref name=gol2>Golomb, Elan PhD (1992). ''Trapped in the Mirror''. New York: Morrow, p. 22.</ref> With narcissistic personality disorder, the individual's self-perceived fantastic grandiosity, often coupled with a [[hypomania|hypomanic]] mood, is typically not commensurate with his or her real accomplishments.

===Splitting===
{{Main|Splitting (psychology)}}
People who are diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder use splitting as a central [[defense mechanism]]. According to psychoanalyst [[Kernberg]], "the normal tension between actual self on the one hand, and ideal self and ideal object on the other, is eliminated by the building up of an inflated self-concept within which the actual self and the ideal self and ideal object are confused. At the same time, the remnants of the unacceptable images are repressed and projected onto external objects, which are devalued."<ref>Kernberg, O.F. (1970). Factors in the psychoanalytic treatment of narcissistic personalities. Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, 18:51–85, p. 56</ref>

The merging of the "inflated self-concept" and the "actual self" is seen in the inherent grandiosity of narcissistic personality disorder. Also inherent in this process are the defense mechanisms of [[Idealization and devaluation|devaluation]], [[Idealization and devaluation|idealization]] and [[denial]].<ref>Siegel, J.P. (2006). Dyadic splitting in partner relational disorders. Journal of Family Psychology, 20 (3), 418–422</ref> Other people are either manipulated as an extension of one's own self, who serve the sole role of giving "admiration and approval"<ref>Kernberg, O.F. (1970). Factors in the psychoanalytic treatment of narcissistic personalities. Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, 18:51–85, p. 52</ref> or they are seen as worthless (because they cannot collude with the narcissist's grandiosity).<ref>Kernberg, O.F. (1970). Factors in the psychoanalytic treatment of narcissistic personalities. Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, 18:51–85</ref>

===Relationship to shame===
It has been suggested that narcissistic personality disorder may be related to defenses against [[shame]].<ref name=shame1>Wurmser L, Shame, the veiled companion of narcissism, in The Many Faces of Shame, edited by Nathanson DL. New York, Guilford, 1987, pp. 64–92.</ref> Psychiatrist [[Glen Gabbard]] suggested NPD could be broken down into two subtypes.<ref name=shame2>Gabbard GO,
[http://jppr.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/external_ref?access_num=2819295&link_type=MEDTwo subtypes of narcissistic personality disorder.] Bull Menninger Clin 1989; 53:527–532.</ref> He saw the "oblivious" subtype as being [[grandiose]], arrogant, and thick-skinned and the "[[hypervigilance|hypervigilant]]" subtype as being easily hurt, oversensitive, and ashamed.  In his view, the oblivious subtype presents for admiration, [[envy]], and appreciation of a powerful, grandiose self that is the antithesis of a weak internalized self, which hides in shame, while the [[hypervigilant]] subtype neutralizes devaluation by seeing others as unjust abusers. Dr. [[Jeffrey Young]], who coined the term "[[Schema Therapy]]", a technique originally developed by psychiatrist [[Aaron T. Beck]] (1979), also links NPD and shame. He sees the so-called Defectiveness Schema as a core schema of NPD, along with the Emotional Deprivation and Entitlement Schemas.<ref>Young, Klosko, Weishaar: Schema Therapy – A Practitioner's Guide, 2003, p. 375.</ref>

==Diagnosis==

===Proposed removal from DSM-5===

The ''Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group'' originally proposed<ref>{{Cite document|title=DSM-5: Proposed Revisions: Personality and Personality Disorders|date=2010-02-13|publisher=''[[American Psychiatric Association]]'' |url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/PersonalityandPersonalityDisorders.aspx}}</ref> the elimination of NPD as a distinct disorder in [[DSM-5]]<ref>{{cite news|last=Zanor|first=Charles|title=A Fate That Narcissists Will Hate: Being Ignored|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/30/health/views/30mind.html|accessdate=30 November 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=29 November 2010}}</ref> as part of a major revamping of the diagnostic criteria for personality disorders, replacing a categorical with a dimensional approach based on the severity of dysfunctional personality [[trait domains]].

Some clinicians objected to this, characterizing the new diagnostic system as an "unwieldy conglomeration of disparate models that cannot happily coexist" and may have limited usefulness in clinical practice.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shedler|first=Jonathan |coauthors=Aaron Beck, Peter Fonagy, Glen O. Gabbard, John Gunderson, Otto Kernberg, Robert Michels, and Drew Westen|title=Personality Disorders in DSM-5|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|year=2010|month=September|volume=167|issue=9|pages=1026–1028 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.10050746|pmid=20826853|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pdf_extract/167/9/1026|accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>

In July 2011, the Work Group came back with a major revision to their original proposal. In this revision, NPD was reinstated with dramatic changes to its definition.<ref>http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=19</ref>  The general move towards a dimensional (personality trait-based) view of the Personality Disorders has been maintained despite the reintroduction of NPD.

===ICD-10===
The [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD-10]] lists narcissistic personality disorder under ''({{ICD10|F|60|8|f|60}}) Other specific personality disorders''.<ref name="narcissistic">[http://www.mentalhealth.com/icd/p22-pe07.html Narcissistic personality disorder – [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] 10th Revision ([[ICD-10]])]</ref>

It is a requirement of ICD-10 that a diagnosis of any specific personality disorder also satisfies a set of [[Personality_disorder#General_diagnostic_criteria_2|general personality disorder criteria]].

===Subtypes===
[[Theodore Millon]] identified five narcissist subtypes,<ref name=millon /><ref name=millon9>[http://millon.net/taxonomy/summary.htm Millon, Theodore, Personality Subtypes]</ref> however, there are few pure variants of any subtype.<ref name=millon9/>

|}

Other theorists have identified two types of narcissism. Those narcissists who have been diagnosed with narcissistic grandiosity express behavior "through interpersonally exploitative acts, lack of empathy, intense envy, aggression, and exhibitionism."<ref name="ReferenceB">''Initial Construction and Validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory'', Aaron L. Pincus, Emily B. Ansell, Claudia A. Pimentel, Nicole M. Cain, Aidan G. C. Wright, Kenneth N. Levy</ref> Another type of narcissism is narcissistic vulnerability. It entails (on a conscious level) "helplessness, emptiness, low self-esteem, and shame, which can be expressed in the behavior as being socially avoidant in situations where their self-presentation is not possible so they withdraw, or the approval they need/expect is not being met."<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

==Treatment==
Clinical strategies are outlined by [[Heinz Kohut]], [[Stephen M. Johnson]] and [[James F. Masterson]], while Johns<ref name="Johns" /> discusses a continuum of severity and the kinds of therapy most effective in different cases. [[Schema Therapy]], a form of therapy developed by [[Jeffrey Young]] that integrates several therapeutic approaches ([[psychodynamic]], cognitive, behavioral etc.), also offers an approach for the treatment of NPD.<ref>Young, Klosko, Weishaar: Schema Therapy – A Practitioner's Guide, 2003, chapter 10, pp. 373–424.</ref> It is unusual for people to seek [[therapy]] for NPD. Unconscious fears of exposure or inadequacy often cause defensive disdain of therapeutic processes.<ref name=Gol3>Golomb, Elan PhD (1992). ''Trapped in the Mirror''. New York: Morrow, p. 23.</ref><ref>Kohut, Heinz, (1971). ''The Analysis of the Self: A Systematic Approach to the Psychoanalytic Treatment of Narcissistic Personality Disorders'' ISBN 978-0-8236-0145-5</ref> 
Pattern change strategies, over a long period of time, are for the narcissist to work on increasing their ability to become more empathetic in everyday relationships. To help modify their sense of entitlement and self-centeredness schema is to help them identify how to utilize their unique talents and to help others rather than for their own personal gain. This is not going to change their self-perception of their "entitlement" feeling but more so help them empathize with others.  Another type of treatment would be temperament change.<ref name="Sperry, Lynn 1999">Sperry, Lynn (1999) Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Cognitive Behavior Therapy of DSM-IV Personality Disorders: Highly Effective Interventions for the Most Common Personality Disorder. (131-138). Ann Arbor, MI: Edwards Brothers.</ref>

Anger, rage, impulsivity and impatience can be worked on with skill training. Medication can also be an effective addition if needed.  Anxiety disorders and somatoma dysfunctions are prevalent but the most common would be depression. Medication can be extremely beneficial when treating the disorder with regular therapy.  Medications to help reduce impulsivity, depression, and anger (along with skilled training) will help the person create interpersonal relationships, be less impulsive, be less angry, and treat the depression/anxiety.<ref name="Sperry, Lynn 1999"/>

Group treatment has its benefits as the effectiveness of receiving peer feedback rather than the clinician’s may be more accepted, but group therapy can also contradict itself as the patient may show "demandingness, egocentrism, social isolation and withdrawal, and socially deviant behavior."  Relationship therapy stresses the importance of learning and applying four basic interpersonal skills: "effective expression, empathy, discussion and problem solving/conflict resolution." Marital/relationship therapy is most beneficial when both partners participate.<ref name="Sperry, Lynn 1999"/>

== Correlative associations ==
NPD is comorbid with mood disorders, eating disorders, substance-related disorders and four personality disorders: antisocial, borderline, histrionic and paranoid.<ref>[http://archive.org/details/NarcissisticPersonalityDisorderPrevalenceAndComorbidity NPD prevalence and comorbidity]</ref> NPD is also comorbid with DSM Axis I [[major depressive disorder]].<ref> [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmh.172/abstract] </ref> 

===Eating disorders===
The study of Narcissism and the Narcissistic Defenses in the Eating Disorders was concerned with the correlation between eating pathology and narcissism.
Two types of narcissism were observed: core narcissism, having extremely positive (high) self-esteem combined with delusions about the level and ability of achievement; and narcissistic defenses, defenses that are triggered when self-esteem is threatened. Such narcissists maintain self-esteem by seeing themselves as misunderstood and a subject to intolerable demands.<ref name="ReferenceC">Narcissism and Narcissistic Defences in the Eating Disorders  Glenn Waller, BA, MClinPsychol, DPhil,  Jennie Sines, BSc3, Caroline Meyer, BSc, PhD, Anna Skelton, BSc3,  Emma Foster, BSc</ref>

Two types of narcissistic defenses that were measured with eating pathology were "poisonous pedagogy" and "narcissistically abused". Poisonous pedagogy is one who places blame on others and is overly critical of others' inadequacies.  The narcissistically abused are those who put others’ needs before theirs yet see themselves as being poorly treated ("poor me").
Two groups were measured: Clinical ( 83 women and one male with the mean age of 28.4) and Non Clinical ( 70 women mean age of 23.2). BMI of groups did not significantly vary. They filled out a questionnaire that was measured by eating characteristic and narcissism levels by the OMNI (O’Brien Multiphasic Narcissism Inventory) and the EDE-Q (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire).  OMNI measures pathological narcissism of narcissistic personality, poisonous pedagogy, and narcissistically abused personality. EDE-Q measures the common eating disorders: restraint, eating concern, body shape concern, and body weight concern.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

The basic summaries of the questionnaire’s findings were the poisonous pedagogy defenses was related to restrictive mind-set; narcissistically abused defense related to restraint, eating concern, body shape concern, and body weight concern. The only main difference between the groups was the role of core narcissism in the clinical women’s levels of eating concerns.  Further research is needed to better understand the relationship approaches in both groups.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

=== Professional attainment ===

In 2005, Board and Fritzon published the results of a study in which they interviewed senior business managers, assessing them for the presence of personality disorder.<ref>"Disorder personalities at work", Belinda Board and Katarina Fritzon, 2005, Psychology, Crime and Law, 11(1), pp.17-32. <http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10683160310001634304></ref>  Comparing their findings to three samples of psychiatric patients, they found that their senior business managers were as likely to demonstrate narcissistic traits as the patient population, although were less physically aggressive.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that narcissists may be particularly common in the financial sector as they "are able to make quick, bold decisions without any thought for the consequences these might have on other people".<ref>"When narcissism becomes pathological", Adrian Tempany, [[Financial Times]], 4 September 2010, accessed 23 June 2012.<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/5ff67be2-b636-11df-a784-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1wu6UVK53></ref> One financier with experience of NPD claimed to know a recruitment consultant who actively sought to recruit narcissists.

==Epidemiology==
Lifetime prevalence is estimated at 1% in the general population and 2% to 16% in clinical populations.<ref name=AMN/><ref>[http://www.businessday.co.za/Articles/Content.aspx?id=130981 Megalomaniacs abound in politics/medicine/finance] Business Day 2011/01/07</ref>

In 2009, Twenge and Campbell conducted studies suggesting that the incidence of NPD had more than doubled in the US in the prior 10 years, and that 1 in 16 of the population have experienced NPD.<ref>Twenge, Jean M. & Campbell, W. Keith The Narcissism Epidemic: Living in the Age of Entitlement (2009)</ref>

==Cultural depictions==
In the film ''[[To Die For]]'', [[Nicole Kidman|Nicole Kidman's]] character wants to appear on television at all costs, even if this involves murdering her husband. A psychiatric assessment of her character noted that she "was seen as a prototypical narcissistic person by the raters: on average, she satisfied 8 of 9 criteria for narcissistic personality disorder... had she been evaluated for personality disorders, she would receive a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hesse|first=Morten|coauthors=Schliewe S, Thomsen RR|year=2005|title=Rating of personality disorder features in popular movie characters|journal=BMC Psychiatry|publisher=BioMed Central|location=London|volume=5|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/5/45|doi=10.1186/1471-244X-5-45|pages=45|pmc=1325244|pmid=16336663}}
