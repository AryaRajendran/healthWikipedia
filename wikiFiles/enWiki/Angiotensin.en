'''Angiotensin''' is a [[peptide hormone]] that causes [[vasoconstriction]] and a subsequent increase in [[blood pressure]]. It is part of the [[renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system|renin-angiotensin system]], which is a major target for drugs that lower blood pressure. Angiotensin also stimulates the release of [[aldosterone]], another hormone, from the [[adrenal cortex]]. [[Aldosterone]] promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron, in the kidney, which also drives blood pressure up. 

Angiotensin is an [[peptide|oligopeptide]] and is a [[hormone]] and a powerful [[dipsogen]]. It is derived from the precursor molecule angiotensinogen, a serum globulin produced in the [[liver]]. It plays an important role in the [[renin-angiotensin system]]. Angiotensin was independently isolated in Indianapolis and Argentina in the late 1930s (as 'angiotonin' and 'hypertensin', respectively) and subsequently characterised and synthesized by groups at the [[Cleveland Clinic]] and [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals|Ciba]] laboratories in Basel, Switzerland.<ref name="pmid11751697">{{cite journal | author = Basso N, Terragno NA | title = History about the discovery of the renin-angiotensin system | journal = Hypertension | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 1246–9 | year = 2001 | month = December | pmid = 11751697 | doi = 10.1161/hy1201.101214 | url =  }}</ref>

== Precursor, and types of angiotensin ==

=== Angiotensinogen ===

Angiotensinogen is an [[Alpha globulin|α-2-globulin]] produced constitutively and released into the circulation mainly by the liver.  It is a member of the [[serpin]] family, although it is not known to inhibit other enzymes, unlike most serpins. Plasma angiotensinogen levels are increased by plasma [[corticosteroid]], [[estrogen]], [[thyroid]] [[hormone]], and angiotensin II levels. 

Angiotensinogen is also known as renin substrate. Human angiotensinogen is 452 amino acids long, but other species have angiotensinogen of varying sizes. The first 12 amino acids are the most important for activity.

Angiotensin I ([[CAS registry number|CAS]]# 11128-99-7) is formed by the action of [[renin]] on [[angiotensinogen]]. Renin is produced in the [[kidney]]s in response to renal sympathetic activity, decreased intrarenal blood pressure (<90mmHg systolic blood pressure<ref>{{cite web|title=JAMA Article Jan 2012|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/280/13/1168.full}}</ref> ) at the [[juxtaglomerular cell]]s, or decreased delivery of Na+ and Cl- to the [[macula densa]].<ref name="isbn0-07-146633-9">{{cite book | editor = Loscalzo J, Fauci AS, Braunwald E, Kasper DL, Hauser SL, Longo DL | authorlink = | others = | title = Harrison's principles of internal medicine | edition = | language = | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = | year = 2008 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-07-146633-9 | author =  Williams GH, Dluhy RG | chapter = Chapter 336: Disorders of the Adrenal Cortex | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>  If less Na+ is sensed by the macula densa, renin release by juxtaglomerular cells is increased.

Renin cleaves the [[peptide bond]] between the [[leucine]] (Leu) and [[valine]] (Val) residues on angiotensinogen, creating the ten-[[amino acid]] peptide (des-Asp) angiotensin I ([[CAS registry number|CAS]]# 9041-90-1).

Angiotensin I appears to have no biological activity and exists solely as a precursor to angiotensin 2.

=== Angiotensin II ===

:Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe | His-Leu

Angiotensin I  is converted to angiotensin II (AII) through removal of two C-terminal residues by the enzyme ''[[angiotensin-converting enzyme]]'' (ACE), primarily through ACE within the lung (but also present in endothelial and kidney epithelial cells).  ACE found in other tissues of the body has no physiological role (ACE has a high density in the lung, but activation here promotes no vasoconstriction, angiotensin II is below physiological levels of action).{{Citation needed|reason=contrary to all other references I've seen.|date=September 2012}}  Angiotensin II acts as an [[endocrine system|endocrine]], [[autocrine signalling|autocrine]]/[[paracrine signalling|paracrine]], and [[intracrine]] hormone.

ACE is a target for inactivation by [[ACE inhibitor]] drugs, which decrease the rate of AII production. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by stimulating the Gq protein in vascular smooth muscle cells (which in turn activates contraction by an IP3-dependent mechanism). [[ACE inhibitor]]s are major anti-hypertensive drugs.

Other cleavage products of ACE, seven or 9 amino acids long, are also known; they have differential affinity for [[angiotensin receptors]], although their exact role is still unclear. The action of AII itself is targeted by [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]]s, which directly block [[Angiotensin receptor|angiotensin II AT<sub>1</sub> receptors]].

Angiotensin II is degraded to angiotensin III by angiotensinases located in red blood cells and the vascular beds of most tissues. It has a half-life in circulation of around 30 seconds, whereas, in tissue, it may be as long as 15–30 minutes.

=== Angiotensin III ===

:Asp | Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe

Angiotensin III has 40% of the [[Vasoconstrictor|pressor]] activity of angiotensin II, but 100% of the aldosterone-producing activity.

=== Angiotensin IV ===

:Arg | Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe

Angiotensin IV is a hexapeptide that, like angiotensin III, has some lesser activity.
 
== Effects == <!--Renin-angiotensin_system has a link to here-->
:''See also [[Renin-angiotensin_system#Effects]]''
Angiotensins II, III and IV have a number of effects throughout the body:

=== Adipic ===

=== Cardiovascular ===

They are potent direct [[vasoconstrictor]]s, constricting arteries and veins and increasing blood pressure. 

Angiotensin II has prothrombotic potential through adhesion and aggregation of [[platelets]] and stimulation of [[plasminogen activator inhibitor 1|PAI-1]] and [[plasminogen activator inhibitor 2|PAI-2]].<ref name="skurk">{{cite journal |author=Skurk T, Lee YM, Hauner H |title=Angiotensin II and its metabolites stimulate PAI-1 protein release from human adipocytes in primary culture |journal=Hypertension |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=1336–40 |year=2001 |month=May |pmid=11358950 |doi= 10.1161/01.HYP.37.5.1336|url=http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11358950}}</ref><ref name="Gesualdo">{{cite journal |author=Gesualdo L |title=Angiotensin IV stes plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression in proximal tubular epithelial cells |journal=Kidney Int. |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=461–70 |year=1999 |month=August |pmid=10432384 |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1755.1999.00578.x |url= |author-separator=, |author2=Ranieri E |author3=Monno R |display-authors=3 |last4=Rossiello |first4=Maria Rosaria |last5=Colucci |first5=Mario |last6=Semeraro |first6=Nicola |last7=Grandaliano |first7=Giuseppe |last8=Schena |first8=Francesco Paolo |last9=Ursi |first9=Michele}}</ref>
  
When cardiac cell growth is stimulated, a local (autocrine-paracrine) renin-angiotensin system is activated in the cardiac myocyte, which stimulates cardiac cell growth through protein kinase C. The same system can be activated in smooth muscle cells in conditions of hypertension, atherosclerosis, or endothelial damage. Angiotensin II is the most important Gq stimulator of the heart during hypertrophy, compared to endothelin-1 and α1 adrenoreceptors.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

=== Neural ===

Angiotensin II increases [[thirst]] sensation ([[dipsogen]]) through the [[subfornical organ]] of the brain, decreases the response of the [[baroreceptor reflex]], and increases the desire for [[table salt|salt]]. It increases secretion of [[vasopressin|ADH]] in the [[posterior pituitary]] and secretion of [[corticotropin|ACTH]] in the anterior pituitary. It also potentiates the release of [[norepinephrine]] by direct action on postganglionic [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] fibers.

=== Adrenal ===
Angiotensin II acts on the [[adrenal cortex]], causing it to release [[aldosterone]], a hormone that causes the kidneys to retain sodium and lose potassium. Elevated plasma angiotensin II levels are responsible for the elevated aldosterone levels present during the luteal phase of the [[menstrual cycle]].

=== Renal ===
Angiotensin II has a direct effect on the proximal tubules to increase Na<sup>+</sup> [[absorption (chemistry)|reabsorption]]. It has a complex and variable effect on [[glomerular filtration]] and [[renal blood flow]] depending on the setting. Increases in systemic blood pressure will maintain renal perfusion pressure; however, constriction of the afferent and efferent glomerular arterioles will tend to restrict renal blood flow. The effect on the efferent arteriolar resistance is, however, markedly greater, in part due to its smaller basal diameter; this tends to increase glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and maintain [[glomerular filtration rate]]. A number of other mechanisms can affect renal blood flow and GFR. High concentrations of Angiotensin II can constrict the glomerular mesangium, reducing the area for glomerular filtration. Angiotensin II is a sensitizer to [[tubuloglomerular feedback]], preventing an excessive rise in GFR. Angiotensin II causes the local release of prostaglandins, which, in turn, antagonize renal vasoconstriction. The net effect of these competing mechanisms on glomerular filtration will vary with the physiological and pharmacological environment.
