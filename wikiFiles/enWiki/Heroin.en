'''Heroin''' ('''diacetylmorphine''' or '''morphine diacetate''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]])), also known as '''diamorphine''' ([[British Approved Name|BAN]]), and colloquially as '''H''', '''smack''', '''horse''', '''brown''', '''black''', '''tar''', and other names,<ref>http://thecyn.com/heroin-rehab/street-names/</ref> is an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] synthesized by [[Charles Romley Alder Wright|C.R. Alder Wright]] in 1874 by adding two acetyl groups to the molecule [[morphine]], found in the [[opium poppy]]. It is the 3,6-[[acetate|diacetyl]] [[ester]] of morphine, and functions as a morphine [[prodrug]], meaning that it is metabolically converted to morphine inside the body in order for it to work.<ref name="Sawynok 1986">{{cite journal |author=Sawynok J |title=The therapeutic use of heroin: a review of the pharmacological literature |journal=Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |year=1986 |month=January |pmid=2420426 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

When used in medicine it is typically used to treat severe pain, such as that resulting from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] or a severe injury. The name "heroin" is only used when being discussed in its illegal form. When it is used in a medical environment, it is referred to as diamorphine. The white crystalline form considered "pure heroin" is usually the [[hydrochloride]] salt, diacetylmorphine hydrochloride.

Illicit heroin is usually in [[Free base|freebase]] form, dulling the sheen and consistency to a matte-white powder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alcoholism.about.com/od/heroin/a/heroin.htm |title=Basic Facts About Heroin |publisher=Alcoholism.about.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> Because of its lower [[boiling point]], the freebase form of heroin is also smokable. It is prevalent in heroin coming from [[Afghanistan]], which as of 2004 produced roughly 87% of the world supply in illicit [[raw opium]].<ref name=UNODCSurvey /> However, production in [[Mexico]] has risen six times from 2007 to 2011, changing that percentage and placing Mexico as the second largest opium producer in the world.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-15766572 BBC News, Latin American & Caribbean: "Mexico targets heroine (sic) poppy plantations."] Eric Camara 16 November 2011</ref>

Mexican cartels are also known to produce a third type of illicit heroin, commonly called [[black tar heroin|black tar]], which results from a simplified, quicker [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] procedure and contains a high percentage of morphine derivates other than heroin, such as [[6-Monoacetylmorphine|6-monoacetylmorphine]] (6-MAM).

As with other [[opioids]], diacetylmorphine is used as both an [[analgesic]] and a [[recreational drug]]. Frequent and regular administration is associated with [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[physical dependence]]. Internationally, diacetylmorphine is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]].<ref>{{cite web

Under the chemical names diamorphine and diacetylmorphine, heroin is a legally [[Prescription drug|prescribed]] [[controlled drug]] in the United Kingdom, and is supplied in tablet or injectable form for the same indications as [[Morphine#Medical uses|morphine]] is, often being preferred over morphine due to its lower side-effect profile.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} It is also available for [[heroin maintenance|prescription to long-term users]] as a form of [[opioid replacement therapy]] in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, and Denmark, alongside [[Counseling|psycho-social care]]—in the same manner that [[methadone]] or [[buprenorphine]] are used in the United States or Canada<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/588/germany_approves_heroin_maintenance |title=Europe: German Parliament Approves Heroin Maintenance |publisher=StoptheDrugWar.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/525/denmark_heroin_maintenance_pilot_program |title=Europe: Denmark Parliament Approves Heroin Maintenance Pilot Project |publisher=StoptheDrugWar.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref>—and a similar programme is being campaigned for by liberal political parties in Norway.

===Medical use===
Under the chemical name diamorphine, diacetylmorphine is [[Prescription medicine|prescribed]] as a strong [[analgesic]] in the United Kingdom, where it is given via [[subcutaneous]], [[intramuscular]], [[intrathecal]] or [[intravenous]] route. Its use includes treatment for acute pain, such as in severe [[physical trauma]], [[myocardial infarction]], post-surgical pain, and chronic pain, including end-stage [[cancer]] and other [[terminal illness]]es. In other countries it is more common to use [[morphine]] or other strong [[opioids]] in these situations. In 2004, the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] produced guidance on the management of [[caesarian section]], which recommended the use of intrathecal or epidural diacetylmorphine for post-operative pain relief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/10940/29331/29331.pdf |title=NICE Clinical Guideline 13: Caesarian section| page=20 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref>

In 2005, there was a shortage of diacetylmorphine in the UK, because of a problem at the main UK manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukhra.org/statements/diamorphine_shortage_uk.html |title=Diamorphine shortage: UKHRA statement on the UK diamorphine shortage |publisher=Ukhra.org |date=2005-09-14 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> Because of this, many hospitals changed to using [[morphine]] instead of diacetylmorphine. Although there is no longer a problem with the manufacturing of diacetylmorphine in the UK, some hospitals there have continued to use morphine. The majority, however, continue to use diacetylmorphine, and diacetylmorphine tablets are supplied for [[pain management]].

Diacetylmorphine continues to be widely used in [[palliative care]] in the United Kingdom, where it is commonly given by the [[subcutaneous]] route, often via a [[syringe driver]], if patients cannot easily swallow [[morphine|oral morphine solution]]. The advantage of diacetylmorphine over [[morphine]] is that diacetylmorphine is more [[lipophilicity|fat soluble]] and therefore more potent (by injection only), so smaller doses of it are needed for the same analgesic effect. Both of these factors are advantageous if giving high doses of opioids via the [[subcutaneous]] route, which is often necessary in [[palliative care]].

The medical use of diacetylmorphine (in common with other strong [[opioids]] such as [[morphine]], [[fentanyl]] and [[oxycodone]]) is controlled in the United Kingdom by the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]]. In the UK, it is a class A [[controlled drug]] and as such is subject to guidelines surrounding its storage, administration and destruction. Possession of Diamorphine without a prescription is an arrestable offence. When Diamorphine is prescribed in a hospital or similar environment, its administration must be supervised by 2 people who must then complete and sign a CD register detailing the patients name, amount, time, date and route of administration. In the case of a doctor administering diamorphine, then he/she may administer the drug alone, however the rule requiring two registered practitioners (ie. a nurse, midwife or another doctor) to sign the CD register still applies. The use of a "witness" when administering Diamorphine is to avoid the possibility of the drug being diverted onto the black market.

For safety reasons, many UK [[National Health Service]] hospitals now only permit the administration of intravenous diamorphine in designated areas. In practice this usually means a [[critical care unit]], an [[accident and emergency]] department, operating theatres by an [[anaesthetist]] or [[nurse anesthetist|nurse anaesthetist]] or other such areas where close monitoring and support from senior staff is immediately available. However, administration by other routes is permitted in other areas of the hospital. This includes subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenously as part of a [[patient controlled analgesia]] setup, and as an already established [[epidural]] [[infusion|infusion pump]]. Subcutaneous infusion, along with subcutaneous and intramuscular 'bolus' administration is often used in the patient's own home, in order to treat severe pain in terminal illness.

Diacetylmorphine is also used as a [[heroin maintenance|maintenance drug]] to treat certain groups of addicts, normally long term chronic IV heroin users, and even in these situations it is only prescribed following exhaustive efforts at treatment via other means. It is thought that heroin users can walk into a clinic and walk out with a prescription but the process takes many weeks before a prescription for Diacetylmorphine is issued. Though this is somewhat controversial among proponents of a [[zero tolerance]] drug policy, it has proven superior to [[methadone]] in improving the social and health situation of addicts.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haasen |first1=C. |last2=Verthein |first2=U. |last3=Degkwitz |first3=P. |last4=Berger |first4=J. |last5=Krausz |first5=M. |last6=Naber |first6=D. |title=Heroin-assisted treatment for opioid dependence: Randomised controlled  trial |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=191 |pages=55–62 |year=2007 |pmid=17602126 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.106.026112}}</ref> See: [[#Prescription for addicts|Heroin prescription for addicts]]

===Recreational use===
Diacetylmorphine, almost always still called by its original trade name of heroin in non-medical settings, is used as a recreational drug for the [[Wiktionary:transcendent|transcendent]] relaxation and intense [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]] it induces. [[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] Michael Agar once described heroin as "the perfect whatever drug."<ref name="agar">{{cite book

Like any city, but more than most, New York is an information overload, a constant perceptual tornado that surrounds you most places you walk on the streets. Heroin is the audio-visual technology that helps manage that overload by dampening it in general and allowing a focus on some part of it that the human perceptual equipment was, in fact, designed to handle. }}</ref> [[Physiological tolerance|Tolerance]] develops quickly, and users need more of the drug to achieve the same effects. Its popularity with recreational drug users, compared to [[morphine]], reportedly stems from its perceived different effects.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=188–93 |doi=10.1007/s00213-002-1271-3}}</ref> In particular, users report an intense [[Rush (psychology)|rush]], an acute transcendent state of [[euphoria]], which occurs while diacetylmorphine is being metabolized into 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and morphine in the brain. Some believe that heroin produces more euphoria than other opioids upon injection; one possible explanation is the presence of 6-monoacetylmorphine, a metabolite unique to heroin - although a more likely explanation is the rapidity of onset. While other opioids of recreational use produce only morphine, heroin also leaves 6-MAM, also a psycho-[[active metabolite]]. However, this perception is not supported by the results of clinical studies comparing the physiological and subjective effects of injected heroin and morphine in individuals formerly addicted to opioids; these subjects showed no preference for one drug over the other. Equipotent injected doses had comparable action courses, with no difference in subjects' self-rated feelings of euphoria, ambition, nervousness, relaxation, drowsiness, or sleepiness.<ref name="martin and fraser">{{cite journal |author=Martin WR, Fraser HF |title=A comparative study of physiological and subjective effects of heroin and morphine administered intravenously in postaddicts |journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |volume=133 |issue= |pages=388–99 |year=1961 |month=September |pmid=13767429 |doi= |url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=13767429}}</ref>

Short-term addiction studies by the same researchers demonstrated that tolerance developed at a similar rate to both heroin and morphine. When compared to the opioids [[hydromorphone]], [[fentanyl]], [[oxycodone]], and [[pethidine]]/[[meperidine]], former addicts showed a strong preference for heroin and morphine, suggesting that heroin and morphine are particularly susceptible to abuse and addiction. Morphine and heroin were also much more likely to produce euphoria and other positive subjective effects when compared to these other opioids.<ref name="martin and fraser" />

Some researchers have attempted to explain heroin use and the culture that surrounds it through the use of sociological theories. In ''Righteous Dopefiend'', Philippe Bourgois and Jeff Schonberg use [[anomie theory]] to explain why people begin using heroin. By analyzing a community in San Francisco, they demonstrated that heroin use was caused in part due to internal and external factors such as violent homes and parental neglect. This lack of emotional, social, and financial support causes strain and influences individuals to engage in deviant acts, including heroin usage.<ref name=righteous/> They further found that heroin users practiced "retreatism", a behavior first described by Howard Abadinsky, in which those suffering from such strain reject society's goals and institutionalized means of achieving them.<ref name=orgcrime>{{cite book|last=Abadinsky|first=Howard|title=Organized Crime|year=2007|publisher=Wadsworth}}</ref>

This "policing and prescribing" policy effectively controlled the perceived diacetylmorphine problem in the UK until 1959 when the number of diacetylmorphine addicts doubled every 16 months during a period of ten years, 1959–1968.<ref>[http://www.rns.se/swedish-addiction.asp Nils Bejerot: The Swedish Addiction Epidemic in global perspective]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref> In 1964 the [[Brain Committee]] recommended that only selected approved doctors working at approved specialised centres be allowed to prescribe diacetylmorphine and benzoylmethylecgonine ([[cocaine]]) to users. The law was made more restrictive in 1968. Beginning in the 1970s, the emphasis shifted to abstinence and the use of [[methadone]]; until now only a small number of users in the UK are prescribed diacetylmorphine.<ref>{{cite web

In 1994 Switzerland began a trial [[Heroin-assisted treatment|diamorphine maintenance]] program for users that had failed multiple withdrawal programs. The aim of this program was to maintain the health of the user by avoiding medical problems stemming from the illicit use of diacetylmorphine. The first trial in 1994 involved 340 users, although enrollment was later expanded to 1000 based on the apparent success of the program. 

The trials proved [[Heroin-assisted treatment|diamorphine maintenance]] to be superior to other forms of treatment in improving the social and health situation for this group of patients.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17602126 | doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.106.026112 | volume=191 | title=Heroin-assisted treatment for opioid dependence: randomised controlled trial | year=2007 | month=July | journal=Br J Psychiatry | pages=55–62}}</ref> It has also been shown to save money, despite high treatment expenses, as it significantly reduces costs incurred by trials, incarceration, health interventions and [[:wikt:delinquency|delinquency]].<ref>http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/Com-e/ille-e/presentation-e/ucht-e.htm</ref>

===Detection in biological fluids===
The major metabolites of diacetylmorphine, 6-MAM, morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide, may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine to monitor for abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Most commercial opiate screening tests cross-react appreciably with these metabolites, as well as with other biotransformation products likely to be present following usage of street-grade diacetylmorphine such as 6-acetylcodeine and codeine. However, chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish and measure each of these substances. When interpreting the results of a test, it is important to consider the diacetylmorphine usage history of the individual, since a chronic user can develop tolerance to doses that would incapacitate an opiate-naive individual, and the chronic user often has high baseline values of these metabolites in his system.

Many countries and local governments have begun funding programs that supply [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] needles to people who inject illegal drugs in an attempt to reduce these contingent risks, and especially the spread of blood-borne diseases. The Drug Policy Alliance reports that up to 75% of new AIDS cases among women and children are directly or indirectly a consequence of drug use by injection {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. The United States federal government does not operate needle exchanges, although some state and local governments do support needle exchange programs.

Anthropologists [[Philippe Bourgois]] and Jeff Schonberg, performed a decade of field work among homeless heroin and cocaine addicts in San Francisco, published in 2009. They reported that the African-American addicts they observed were more inclined to "direct deposit" heroin into a vein, while "[[Skin popping|skin-popping]]" was a far more widespread practice: "By the midpoint of our fieldwork, most of the whites had given up searching for operable veins and skin-popped. They sank their needles perfunctorily, often through their clothing, into their fatty tissue.") Bourgois and Schonberg describes how the cultural difference between the African-Americans and the whites leads to this contrasting behavior, and also points out that the two different ways to inject heroin comes with different health risks. Skin-popping more often results in abscesses, and direct injection more often leads to fatal overdose and also to [[hepatitis C]] and [[HIV]] infection.<ref name=righteous>{{cite book | last = Bourgois | first = Philippe | coauthors = Jeff Schonberg | title = Righteous Dopefiend | url = http://www.americanethnography.com/article.php?id=92 | accessdate = 2009-10-13 | year = 2009 | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley and Los Angeles | isbn = 0-520-25498-8}}</ref>

Heroin [[overdose]] is usually treated with an opioid [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} such as [[naloxone]] ([[Narcan]]), or [[naltrexone]], which has high affinity for [[opioid receptors]] but does not activate them. This reverses the effects of heroin and other opioid agonists and causes an immediate return of consciousness but may precipitate [[withdrawal]] symptoms. The [[half-life]] of [[naloxone]] is much shorter than that of most opioid agonists, so that antagonist typically has to be administered multiple times until the opioid has been metabolized by the body.

Depending on drug interactions and numerous other factors, death from overdose can take anywhere from several minutes to several hours because of anoxia resulting from the breathing reflex being suppressed by agonism of [[opioid receptor|µ-opioid receptors]]. An overdose is immediately reversible with an [[opioid antagonist]] injection. Diacetylmorphine overdoses can occur because of an unexpected increase in the dose or purity or because of diminished opioid tolerance. However, many fatalities reported as overdoses are probably caused by interactions with other [[depressant]] drugs like alcohol or [[benzodiazepine]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Darke |first1=Shane |last2=Zador |first2=Deborah |title=Fatal heroin 'overdose': a review |journal=Addiction |volume=91 |issue=12 |pages=1765–1772 |year=1996 |pmid=8997759 |doi=10.1046/j.1360-0443.1996.911217652.x}}</ref> It should also be noted that since heroin can cause nausea and vomiting, a significant number of deaths attributed to heroin overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious victim. Some sources quote the [[median lethal dose]] (for an average 75&nbsp;kg opiate-naive individual) as being between 75 and 375&nbsp;mg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lincoln.pps.k12.or.us/lscheffler/ToxicSubstances%20in%20water.htm |title=Toxic Substances in water |publisher=Lincoln.pps.k12.or.us |date= |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> Illicit heroin is of widely varying and unpredictable purity. This means that the user may prepare what they consider to be a moderate dose while actually taking far more than intended. Also, tolerance typically decreases after a period of abstinence. If this occurs and the user takes a dose comparable to their previous use, the user may experience drug effects that are much greater than expected, potentially resulting in a dangerous overdose. It has been speculated that an unknown portion of heroin related deaths are the result of an overdose or allergic reaction to [[quinine]], which may sometimes be used as a cutting agent.<ref>[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/cu/cu12.htm The "heroin overdose" mystery and other occupational hazards of addiction], Schaffer Library of Drug Policy</ref>

A final factor contributing to overdoses is [[Operant conditioning|place conditioning]]. Diacetylmorphine use is a highly ritualized behavior. While the mechanism has yet to be clearly elucidated, longtime heroin users display increased tolerance to the drug in locations where they have repeatedly administered. When the user injects in a different location, this environment-conditioned tolerance does not occur, resulting in a greater drug effect. The user's typical dose of the drug, in the face of decreased tolerance, becomes far too high and can be toxic, leading to overdose.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gerevich |first1=JóZsef |last2=Bácskai |first2=Erika |last3=Farkas |first3=Lajos |last4=Danics |first4=Zoltán |title=A case report: Pavlovian conditioning as a risk factor of heroin 'overdose' death |journal=Harm Reduction Journal |volume=2 |page=11 |year=2005 |pmid=16042795 |pmc=1196296 |doi=10.1186/1477-7517-2-11}}</ref>

A small percentage of heroin smokers, and occasionally IV users, may develop symptoms of [[toxic leukoencephalopathy]]. The cause has yet to be identified, but one speculation is that the disorder is caused by an uncommon [[adulterant]] that is only active when heated.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hill MD, Cooper PW, Perry JR |title=Chasing the dragon--neurological toxicity associated with inhalation of heroin vapour: case report |journal=CMAJ |volume=162 |issue=2 |pages=236–8 |year=2000 |month=January |pmid=10674060 |pmc=1232277 |doi= |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10674060}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Halloran |first1=O. |last2=Ifthikharuddin |first2=S |last3=Samkoff |first3=L |title=Leukoencephalopathy from "chasing the dragon" |journal=Neurology |volume=64 |issue=10 |page=1755 |year=2005 |pmid=15911804 |doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000149907.63410.DA}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Offiah |first1=C |last2=Hall |first2=E |title=Heroin-induced leukoencephalopathy: characterization using MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging, and MR spectroscopy |journal=Clinical Radiology |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=146–52 |year=2008 |pmid=18194689 |doi=10.1016/j.crad.2007.07.021}}</ref> Symptoms include slurred speech and difficulty walking.

[[Cocaine]] is sometimes used in combination with heroin, and is referred to as a [[speedball (drug)|speedball]] when injected or ''moonrocks'' when smoked together. Cocaine acts as a [[stimulant]], whereas heroin acts as a [[depressant]]. Coadministration provides an intense rush of [[euphoria]] with a high that combines both effects of the drugs, while excluding the negative effects, such as [[anxiety]] and [[sedation]]. The effects of cocaine wear off far more quickly than heroin, thus if an [[overdose]] of heroin was used to compensate for cocaine, the end result is fatal [[respiratory depression]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Withdrawal===
{{Main|Opioid withdrawal}}
The withdrawal syndrome from heroin (the so-called "[[cold turkey]]") may begin within 6 to 24 hours of discontinuation of the drug; however, this time frame can fluctuate with the degree of tolerance as well as the amount of the last consumed dose.

==Pharmacology==
[[File:Heroin black tar.jpg|thumb|[[Black tar heroin]]]]
When taken orally, heroin undergoes extensive [[first-pass metabolism]] via [[acetylation|deacetylation]], making it a [[prodrug]] for the systemic delivery of morphine.<ref name="Sawynok 1986"/> When the drug is injected, however, it avoids this first-pass effect, very rapidly crossing the [[blood–brain barrier]] because of the presence of the acetyl groups, which render it much more [[lipophilicity|fat soluble]] than morphine itself.<ref name="Klous 2005">{{cite journal |last1=Klous |first1=M |last2=Brink |first2=W |last3=Ree |first3=J |last4=Beijnen |first4=J |title=Development of pharmaceutical heroin preparations for medical co-prescription to opioid dependent patients |journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence |volume=80 |issue=3 |pages=283–95 |year=2005 |pmid=15916865 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2005.04.008}}</ref> Once in the brain, it then is deacetylated variously into the inactive 3-monoacetylmorphine and the active [[6-monoacetylmorphine]] (6-MAM), and then to morphine, which bind to [[Mu opioid receptor|μ-opioid receptor]]s, resulting in the drug's euphoric, [[analgesia|analgesic]] (pain relief), and [[anxiolytic]] (anti-anxiety) effects; heroin itself exhibits relatively low affinity for the μ receptor.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Inturrisi |first1=C |last2=Schultz |first2=M |last3=Shin |first3=S |last4=Umans |first4=JG |last5=Angel |first5=L |last6=Simon |first6=EJ |title=Evidence from opiate binding studies that heroin acts through its metabolites |journal=Life Sciences |volume=33 |pages=773–6 |year=1983 |pmid=6319928 |doi=10.1016/0024-3205(83)90616-1}}</ref> Unlike hydromorphone and oxymorphone, however, administered intravenously, heroin creates a larger histamine release, similar to morphine, resulting in the feeling of a greater subjective "body high" to some, but also instances of [[Itch|pruritus]] (itching) when they first start using.<ref>[http://grande.nal.usda.gov/ibids/index.php?mode2=detail&origin=ibids_references&therow=35525 Histamine release by morphine and diamorphine in man.] & [http://bcbsma.medscape.com/viewarticle/468419_4 Cutaneous Complications of Intravenous Drug Abuse]</ref>

Both morphine and 6-MAM are [[Mu opioid receptor|μ-opioid]] [[agonist]]s that bind to receptors present throughout the [[brain]], [[spinal cord]], and [[Gut (zoology)|gut]] of all [[mammal]]s. The μ-opioid receptor also binds endogenous [[opioid peptide]]s such as [[Beta-endorphin|β-endorphin]], [[Leu-enkephalin]], and [[Met-enkephalin]]. Repeated use of heroin results in a number of physiological changes, including an increase in the production of μ-opioid receptors (upregulation). {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} These physiological alterations lead to tolerance and dependence, so that cessation of heroin use results in a set of remarkably uncomfortable symptoms including pain, anxiety, muscle spasms, and insomnia called the opioid [[withdrawal]] syndrome. Depending on usage it has an onset four to 24 hours after the last dose of heroin. Morphine also binds to [[delta opioid receptor|δ]]- and [[kappa opioid receptor|κ]]-opioid receptors.

There is also evidence that 6-MAM binds to a subtype of μ-opioid receptors that are also activated by the morphine metabolite morphine-6β-glucuronide but not morphine itself.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=G |last2=Yang |first2=K |last3=King |first3=MA |last4=Rossi |first4=GC |last5=Leventhal |first5=L |last6=Chang |first6=A |last7=Pasternak |first7=GW |title=3-Methoxynaltrexone, a selective heroin/morphine-6β-glucuronide antagonist |journal=FEBS Letters |volume=412 |issue=1 |pages=35–8 |year=1997 |pmid=9257684 |doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(97)00710-2}}</ref> The third substype of third opioid type is the mu-3 receptor, which may be a commonality to other six-position monoesters of morphine. The contribution of these receptors to the overall pharmacology of heroin remains unknown.

A subclass of morphine derivatives, namely the 3,6 esters of morphine, with similar effects and uses, includes the clinically used strong analgesics [[nicomorphine]] (Vilan), and [[dipropanoylmorphine]]; there is also the latter's [[dihydromorphine]] analogue, [[diacetyldihydromorphine]] (Paralaudin). Two other 3,6 diesters of morphine invented in 1874-5 along with diacetylmorphine, [[dibenzoylmorphine]] and [[acetylpropionylmorphine]], were made as substitutes after it was outlawed in 1925 and, therefore, sold as the first "[[designer drugs]]" until they were outlawed by the League of Nations in 1930.

==Etymology==
In 1895, the German drug company [[Bayer]] marketed diacetylmorphine as an [[over-the-counter drug]] under the trademark name Heroin.<ref name="etymonline.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=heroin |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> The name was derived from the Greek word "''[[Hero]]s''" because of its perceived "heroic" effects upon a user.<ref name="etymonline.com"/>  It was developed chiefly as a [[morphine]] substitute for [[Cough medicine|cough suppressants]] that did not have morphine's addictive side-effects. [[Morphine]] at the time was a popular recreational drug, and Bayer wished to find a similar but non-addictive substitute to market.{{citation}} However, contrary to Bayer's advertising as a "non-addictive morphine substitute," heroin would soon have one of the highest rates of [[drug addiction|dependence]] among its users.<ref>[http://www.drugrehabtreatment.com/most-addictive-drugs.html]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Bayer Heroin bottle.jpg|thumb|left|Bayer Heroin bottle]]

The [[opium poppy]] was cultivated in lower [[Mesopotamia]] as long ago as 3400 BCE.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> The chemical analysis of [[opium]] in the 19th century revealed that most of its activity could be ascribed to two [[alkaloids]], [[codeine]] and [[morphine]].

Diacetylmorphine was first synthesized in 1874 by [[C. R. Alder Wright]], an English chemist working at [[St Mary's Hospital (London)|St. Mary's Hospital]] Medical School in London. He had been experimenting with combining morphine with various acids. He boiled anhydrous morphine alkaloid with [[acetic anhydride]] for several hours and produced a more potent, [[acetylated]] form of morphine, now called ''diacetylmorphine'' or ''morphine diacetate''. The compound was sent to F. M. Pierce of Owens College in Manchester for analysis. Pierce told Wright:

{{quotation|Doses&nbsp;... were [[Route of administration|subcutaneously injected]] into young dogs and rabbits&nbsp;... with the following general results&nbsp;... great [[prostration]], fear, and sleepiness speedily following the administration, the eyes being sensitive, and pupils constrict, considerable [[salivation]] being produced in dogs, and slight tendency to vomiting in some cases, but no actual [[emesis]].

Wright's invention did not lead to any further developments, and diacetylmorphine became popular only after it was independently re-synthesized 23 years later by another chemist, [[Felix Hoffmann]]. Hoffmann, working at the Aktiengesellschaft Farbenfabriken (today the [[Bayer]] pharmaceutical company) in [[Elberfeld, Germany]], was instructed by his supervisor [[Heinrich Dreser]] to acetylate morphine with the objective of producing [[codeine]], a constituent of the opium poppy, pharmacologically similar to morphine but less potent and less addictive. Instead, the experiment produced an acetylated form of morphine one and a half to two times more potent than morphine itself.

From 1898 through to 1910, diacetylmorphine was marketed under the trademark name Heroin as a non-addictive morphine substitute and cough suppressant. Bayer marketed the drug as a cure for morphine addiction before it was discovered that it rapidly metabolizes into morphine. As such, diacetylmorphine is in essence a quicker-acting form of morphine. The company was embarrassed by the new finding, which became a historic blunder for Bayer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opioids.com/heroin/heroinhistory.html |title='&#39;How aspirin turned hero'&#39;, Sunday Times article, reproduced on a BLTC website, accessed 18 March 2009 |publisher=Opioids.com |date=1998-09-13 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref>

In the U.S.A., the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] was passed in 1914 to control the sale and distribution of diacetylmorphine and other opioids, which allowed the drug to be prescribed and sold for medical purposes. In 1924, the United States Congress banned its sale, importation or manufacture. It is now a [[Schedule I controlled substance|Schedule I substance]], which makes it illegal for non-medical use in signatory nations of the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] treaty, including the United States.

The Health Committee of the [[League of Nations]] banned diacetylmorphine in 1925, although it took more than three years for this to be implemented. In the meantime, the first [[designer drugs]], viz. 3,6 diesters and 6 monoesters of morphine and acetylated analogues of closely related drugs like [[hydromorphone]] and [[dihydromorphine]] were produced in massive quantities to fill the worldwide demand for diacetylmorphine—this continued until 1930 when the Committee banned diacetylmorphine analogues with no therapeutic advantage over drugs already in use, the first major legislation of this type.<ref>[[dibenzoylmorphine]]</ref>

Later, as with [[Aspirin]], Bayer lost some of its trademark rights to heroin under the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] following the German defeat in [[World War I]].<ref>

The onset of heroin's effects depends upon the [[route of administration]]. Studies have shown that the subjective pleasure of drug use (the reinforcing component of addiction) is proportional to the rate at which the blood level of the drug increases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/301/2/690.full.pdf |title=Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (JPET) &#124; Onset of Action and Drug Reinforcement |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-10}}</ref> Intravenous injection is the fastest route of drug administration, causing blood concentrations to rise the most quickly, followed by smoking, [[suppository]] (anal or vaginal insertion), [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] (snorting), and [[ingestion]] (swallowing).

Ingestion does not produce a [[Rush (psychology)|rush]] as forerunner to the high experienced with the use of heroin, which is most pronounced with intravenous use. While the onset of the rush induced by injection can occur in as little as a few seconds, the oral route of administration requires approximately half an hour before the high sets in. Thus, with both higher the dosage of heroin used and faster the route of administration used, the higher potential risk for psychological addiction.

{{nowrap|Large doses of heroin}} can cause fatal respiratory depression, and the drug has been used for suicide or as a murder weapon. The serial killer [[Harold Shipman|Dr Harold Shipman]] used diamorphine on his victims, and the subsequent "Shipman Inquiry" led to a tightening of the regulations surrounding the storage, prescribing and destruction of controlled drugs in the UK. [[John Bodkin Adams|Dr John Bodkin Adams]] (see his victim [[Edith Alice Morrell]]) is also known to have used heroin as a murder weapon.

Because significant tolerance to respiratory depression develops quickly with continued use and is lost just as quickly during withdrawal, it is often difficult to determine whether a heroin lethal overdose was accidental, suicide or homicide. Examples include the overdose deaths of [[Sid Vicious]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Tim Buckley]], [[Hillel Slovak]], [[Layne Staley]], [[Bradley Nowell]], [[Ted Binion]], and [[River Phoenix]].<ref>{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,11069-2329203,00.html |title=First murder charge over heroin mix that killed 400|publisher=Times Online |date=2012-03-13 |accessdate=2012-07-20 |first1=Kevin |last1=Eason |first2=Philippe |last2=Naughton}}</ref><!-- more information needed! -->

Chronic use of heroin and other opioids, has been shown to be a potential cause of [[hyponatremia]], resultant because of excess [[vasopressin]] secretion.

Oral use of heroin is less common than other methods of administration, mainly because there is little to no "rush", and the effects are less potent.<ref>{{cite web|author=by sepulfreak |url=http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=41495 |title=Erowid Experience Vaults: Heroin - Catching the Waves - 41495|publisher=Erowid.org |date=2005-07-08 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref> Heroin is entirely converted to [[morphine]] by means of [[first-pass metabolism]], resulting in [[deacetylation]] when ingested. Heroin's oral bioavailability is both dose-dependent (as is morphine's) and significantly higher than oral use of morphine itself, reaching up to 64.2% for high doses and 45.6% for low doses; opiate-naive users showed far less absorption of the drug at low doses, having bioavailabilities of only up to 22.9%. The maximum plasma concentration of morphine following oral administration of heroin was around twice as much as that of oral morphine.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18945270 |title=Oral Diacetylmorphine (heroin) Yields Greater Morphine Morphine Bioavailability than Oral Morphine: Bioavailability Related to Dosage and Prior Opioid Exposure. PubMed. Dec. 2008 |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=2012-05-24 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref>

===Injection===
[[Drug injection|Injection]], also known as "slamming", "banging", "shooting up", "digging" or "mainlining", is a popular method which carries relatively greater risks than other methods of administration. Heroin base (commonly found in Europe), when prepared for injection will only dissolve in water when mixed with an acid (most commonly citric acid powder or lemon juice) and heated. Heroin in the East coast United States is most commonly found in the hydrochloride salt form, requiring just water (and no heat) to dissolve. Users tend to initially inject in the easily accessible arm veins, but as these veins collapse over time, users resort to more dangerous areas of the body, such as the [[femoral vein]] in the groin. Users who have used this route of administration often develop a [[deep vein thrombosis]].<ref>www.drugs-forum.com> ... >Opiate&Opiods>Heroin</ref> Intravenous users can use a various single dose range using a [[hypodermic needle]]. The dose of heroin used for recreational purposes is dependent on the frequency and level of use, thus a first-time user may use between 5 and 20&nbsp;mg, while an established addict may require several hundred mg per day. As with the injection of any drug, if a group of users [[needle sharing|share a common needle]] without sterilization procedures, blood-borne diseases, such as [[HIV]] or [[hepatitis]], can be transmitted.
The use of a common dispenser for water for the use in the preparation of the injection, as well as the sharing of spoons and/or filters can also cause the spread of blood borne diseases. Many countries now supply small sterile spoons and filters for single use in order to prevent the spread of disease.<ref>http://www.idaat.org/files/documents_file-4.pdf</ref>

===Smoking===
Smoking heroin refers to vaporizing it to inhale the resulting fumes, not burning it to inhale the resulting smoke. It is commonly smoked in glass pipes made from [[glassblowing|glassblown]] [[Pyrex|Pyrex tubes]] and light bulbs. It can also be smoked off aluminium foil, which is heated underneath by a flame and the resulting smoke is inhaled through a tube of rolled up foil, This method is also known as "[[chasing the dragon]]" (whereas smoking [[methamphetamine]] is known as "chasing the ''white'' dragon").

===Insufflation===
Another popular route to intake heroin is [[insufflation]] (snorting), where a user crushes the heroin into a fine powder and then gently inhales it (sometimes with a straw or a rolled up [[banknote]], as with [[cocaine]]) into the nose, where heroin is absorbed through the soft tissue in the [[mucous membrane]] of the [[sinus cavity]] and straight into the bloodstream. This method of administration redirects [[first pass metabolism]], with a quicker onset and higher [[bioavailability]] than oral administration, though the duration of action is shortened. This method is sometimes preferred by users who do not want to prepare and administer heroin for injection or smoking, but still experience a fast onset. Snorting heroin becomes an often unwanted route, once a user begins to inject the drug. The user may still get high on the drug from snorting, and experience a nod, but will not get a rush. A "rush" is caused by a large amount of heroin entering the body at once. When the drug is taken in through the nose, the user does not get the rush because the drug is absorbed slowly rather than instantly.

===Suppository===
Little research has been focused on the [[suppository]] (anal insertion) or [[pessary]] (vaginal insertion) methods of administration, also known as "plugging". These methods of administration are commonly carried out using an [[oral syringe]]. Heroin can be dissolved and withdrawn into an oral syringe which may then be lubricated and inserted into the anus or vagina before the plunger is pushed. The rectum or the vaginal canal is where the majority of the drug would likely be taken up, through the membranes lining their walls.

==Regulation==
In the Netherlands, diacetylmorphine is a List I drug of the [[Opium Law]]. It is available for prescription under tight regulation exclusively to long-term addicts for whom [[methadone maintenance]] treatment has failed. It cannot be used to treat severe [[pain]] or other illnesses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heroin|url=http://www.mahalo.com/heroin/|work=Mahalo.com|publisher=Mahalo.com Incorporated|accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref>

In the United States, diacetylmorphine is a schedule I drug according to the [[Controlled Substances Act]] of 1970, making it illegal to possess without a DEA license.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heroin|url=http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showwiki.php?title=Heroin|work=Drugs Forum|publisher=SIN Foundation|accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> Possession of more than 100&nbsp;grams of diacetylmorphine or a mixture containing diacetylmorphine is punishable with a minimum mandatory sentence of 5 years of imprisonment in a federal prison.

In Canada, diacetylmorphine is a controlled substance<ref>{{cite news|title=Medically prescribed heroin more cost-effective than methadone, study suggests|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1144818--medically-prescribed-heroin-more-cost-effective-than-methadone-study-suggests|work=thestar.com|publisher=The Toronto Star|accessdate=27 May 2012|author=Sheryl Ubelacker|date=12|month=March|year=2012}}</ref> under Schedule I of the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]] (CDSA).<ref>{{cite web|title=Heroin Legal Status|url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/heroin/heroin_law.shtml|work=Vaults of Erowid|publisher=Erowid.org|accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref>  Any person seeking or obtaining diacetylmorphine without disclosing authorization 30 days prior to obtaining another prescription from a practitioner is guilty of an indictable offense and subject to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years. Possession of diacetylmorphine for the purpose of trafficking is an indictable offense and subject to imprisonment for life.

In Hong Kong, diacetylmorphine is regulated under Schedule 1 of [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong's]] Chapter 134 ''Dangerous Drugs Ordinance''. It is available by prescription. Anyone supplying diacetylmorphine without a valid prescription can be fined $10,000 ([[Hong Kong dollar|HKD]]). The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing diacetylmorphine is a $50,000 (HKD) fine and life imprisonment. Possession of diacetylmorphine without a license from the Department of Health is illegal with a $10,000 (HKD) fine and/or 7 years of jail time.<ref>{{cite web|title=HEROIN, THE POPPY|url=http://www.addiction-recovery-expose.com/heroin.html|work=Addiction Recovery Expose|publisher=Randolph Online Solutions Inc|accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, diacetylmorphine is available by prescription, though it is a restricted [[Class A drug]]. According to the 50th edition of the [[British National Formulary]] (BNF), diamorphine [[hydrochloride]] may be used in the treatment of acute pain, [[myocardial infarction]], acute [[pulmonary oedema]], and [[chronic pain]]. The treatment of chronic non-[[malignant]] pain must be supervised by a specialist. The BNF notes that all opioid analgesics cause dependence and tolerance but that this is "no deterrent in the control of pain in terminal illness". When used in the [[palliative care]] of cancer patients, diacetylmorphine is often injected using a [[syringe driver]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Heroin|url=http://www.nacada.go.ke/drugs/heroin/|work=NACADA|publisher=NACADA|accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref>

==Production and trafficking==

===Production===
Diacetylmorphine is produced from acetylation of morphine derived from natural opium sources. Numerous mechanical and chemical means are used to purify the final product. The final products have a different appearance depending on purity and have different names.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/research/Bulletin07/bulletin_on_narcotics_2007_Zerell.pdf |title=Documentation of a heroin manufacturing process in Afghanistan. BULLETIN ON NARCOTICS, Volume LVII, Nos. 1 and 2, 2005|publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref>

===Heroin grades===
Heroin purity has been classified into four grades. No.4 is the purest form — white powder (salt) to be easily dissolved and injected. No.3 is "brown sugar" for smoking (base). No.1 and No.2 are unprocessed raw heroin (salt or base).<ref>http://www.crimecommission.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/IDDR/2003_04/iddr_0304_heroin.pdf</ref>

The cultivation of opium in Afghanistan reached its peak in 1999, when {{convert|350|sqmi|km2}} of poppies were sown. The following year the Taliban banned poppy cultivation, a move which cut production by 94 percent. By 2001 only {{convert|30|sqmi|km2}} of land were in use for growing opium poppies. A year later, after American and British troops had removed the Taliban and installed the interim government, the land under cultivation leapt back to {{convert|285|sqmi|km2}}, with Afghanistan supplanting Burma to become the world's largest opium producer once more.<ref>{{cite web|author=technatica |url=http://www.orwelltoday.com/afghanheroin.shtml |title=Afghanistan Heroin |publisher=Orwelltoday.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref>

At present, opium poppies are mostly grown in [[Afghanistan]], and in [[Southeast Asia]], especially in the region known as the Golden Triangle straddling [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]] and [[Yunnan]] province in China. There is also cultivation of opium poppies in the [[Sinaloa]] region of Mexico and in [[Colombia]]. The majority of the heroin consumed in the United States comes from Mexico and [[Colombia]]. Up until 2004, [[Pakistan]] was considered one of the biggest opium-growing countries.

Conviction for trafficking heroin carries the death penalty in most [[Southeast Asian]], some [[East Asian]] and Middle Eastern countries (see [[Use of death penalty worldwide]] for details), among which [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Thailand]] are the most strict. The penalty applies even to citizens of countries where the penalty is not in place, sometimes causing controversy when foreign visitors are arrested for trafficking, for example the arrest of [[Bali Nine|nine Australians in Bali]], the [[death sentence]] given to [[Nola Blake]] in Thailand in 1987, or the hanging of an Australian citizen [[Van Tuong Nguyen]] in Singapore.

===Trafficking history===
[[File:HeroinWorld-en.svg|thumb|400px|Primary worldwide producers of heroin]]

The origins of the present international illegal heroin trade can be traced back to laws passed in many countries in the early 1900s that closely regulated the production and sale of opium and its derivatives including heroin. At first, heroin flowed from countries where it was still legal into countries where it was no longer legal. By the mid-1920s, heroin production had been made illegal in many parts of the world. An illegal trade developed at that time between heroin labs in China (mostly in Shanghai and Tianjin) and other nations. The weakness of government in China and conditions of civil war enabled heroin production to take root there. Chinese [[Triad society|triad]] gangs eventually came to play a major role in the illicit heroin trade. The [[French Connection]] route started in the 1930s.

Heroin trafficking was virtually eliminated in the U.S. during [[World War II]] because of temporary trade disruptions caused by the war. Japan's war with China had cut the normal distribution routes for heroin and the war had generally disrupted the movement of opium.

After World War II, the [[Mafia]] took advantage of the weakness of the postwar Italian government and set up heroin labs in Sicily. The Mafia took advantage of Sicily's location along the historic route opium took westward into Europe and the United States.<ref>Eric C. Schneider, ''Smack:  Heroin and the American City'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008, chapter one</ref>

Large-scale international heroin production effectively ended in China with the victory of the communists in the civil war in the late 1940s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The elimination of Chinese production happened at the same time that Sicily's role in the trade developed.

Although it remained legal in some countries until after World War II, health risks, addiction, and widespread recreational use led most western countries to declare heroin a controlled substance by the latter half of the 20th century.

In late 1960s and early 1970s, the [[CIA]] supported anti-Communist Chinese Nationalists settled near the [[China|Sino]]-[[Burma|Burmese]] border and [[Hmong people|Hmong]] tribesmen in [[Laos]]. This helped the development of the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] opium production region, which supplied about one-third of heroin consumed in US after the 1973 American withdrawal from Vietnam. As of 1999, Burma, the heartland of the Golden Triangle remained the second largest producer of heroin, after [[Afghanistan]].<ref name="Afghan_Burmese_heroin">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1590827.stm|title=War Views: Afghan heroin trade will live on.|date=October 200q|work=Richard Davenport-Hines|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref>

The Soviet-Afghan war led to increased production in the Pakistani-Afghan border regions, as U.S.-backed [[mujaheddin]] militants raised money for arms from selling opium, contributing heavily to the modern [[Golden Crescent]] creation. By 1980, 60% of heroin sold in the U.S. originated in Afghanistan.<ref name="Afghan_Burmese_heroin"/> It increased international production of heroin at lower prices in the 1980s. The trade shifted away from Sicily in the late 1970s as various criminal organizations violently fought with each other over the trade. The fighting also led to a stepped up government law enforcement presence in Sicily.
Following the discovery at a Jordanian airport of a [[toner cartridge]] that had been modified into an [[improvised explosive device]], the resultant increased level of airfreight scrutiny led to a major shortage (drought) of heroin from October 2010 until April 2011. This was reported in most of mainland Europe and the UK which led to a price increase of approx 30% in the cost of street heroin and an increased demand for diverted [[methadone]]. The number of addicts seeking treatment also increased significantly during this period.
Other Heroin droughts (shortages)have been attributed to cartels restricting supply in order to force a price increase and also to a fungus that attacked the opium crop of 2009. Many people thought that the American Government had introduced pathogens into the Afghanistan atmosphere in order to destroy the opium crop and thus, starve insurgents of income.

According to the 2009 report by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC), [[India]] is both the largest producer and consumer of heroin with a value of {{INR}}6000 [[crore]] (US$1.4 billion).<ref>[http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Govt-may-relax-death-penalty-clause-under-Narcotics-Act/Article1-852738.aspx Govt may relax 'death penalty' clause under Narcotics Act]</ref>

==Harm reduction==
<!--IMAGE-->[[File:Rational scale to assess the harm of drugs (mean physical harm and mean dependence).svg|thumb|250px|Data from ''[[The Lancet]]'' shows diacetylmorphine to be the most addictive and most harmful of twenty popular [[recreational drugs]].<ref name="Nutt">{{cite journal |last1=Nutt |first1=D |last2=King |first2=LA |last3=Saulsbury |first3=W |last4=Blakemore |first4=C |title=Development of a rational scale to assess the harm of drugs of potential misuse |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9566 |pages=1047–53 |year=2007 |pmid=17382831 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60464-4}}</ref>]]
{{Main|Harm reduction|Safe injection sites|Needle exchange programs}}
[[Harm reduction]] is a public health philosophy that seeks to reduce the harms associated with the use of diacetylmorphine. One aspect of harm reduction initiatives focuses on the behaviour of individual users. This includes promoting safer means of taking the drug, such as smoking, nasal use, oral or rectal insertion. This attempts to avoid the higher risks of overdose, infections and [[Blood-borne disease|blood-borne viruses]] associated with injecting the drug. Other measures include using a small amount of the drug first to gauge the strength, and minimize the risks of overdose. For the same reason, [[poly drug use]] (the use of two or more drugs at the same time) is discouraged. Injecting diacetylmorphine users are encouraged to use new needles, syringes, spoons/steri-cups and filters every time they inject and not share these with other users. Users are also encouraged to not use it on their own, as others can assist in the event of an overdose.

Governments that support a harm reduction approach usually fund [[needle-exchange programme|needle & syringe exchange programmes]], which supply new needles and syringes on a confidential basis, as well as education on proper filtering prior to injection, safer injection techniques, safe disposal of used injecting gear and other equipment used when preparing diacetylmorphine for injection may also be supplied including citric acid sachets/vitamin C sachets, steri-cups, filters, alcohol pre-injection swabs, sterile water ampules and tourniquets (to stop use of shoe laces or belts).

Another harm reduction measure employed for example in Europe, Canada and Australia are [[safe injection sites]] where users can inject diacetylmorphine and [[cocaine]] under the supervision of medically trained staff. Safe injection sites are low threshold and allow social services to approach problem users that would otherwise be hard to reach.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kimber |first1=Jo |last2=Dolan |first2=Kate |last3=Wodak |first3=Alex |title=Survey of drug consumption rooms: service delivery and perceived public health and amenity impact |journal=Drug and Alcohol Review |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=21–4 |year=2005 |pmid=16191717 |doi=10.1080/09595230500125047}}</ref>
In the UK the Criminal Justice System has a protocol in place that requires that any individual that is arrested and is suspected of having a substance misuse problem, be offered the chance to enter a treatment program. This has had the effect of drastically reducing an area's crime rate as individuals arrested for theft in order to supply the funds for their drugs are no longer in the position of having to steal to purchase Heroin because they have been placed onto a [[Methadone]] program, quite often quicker than would have been possible had they not been arrested. This aspect of harm reduction is seen as being beneficial to both the individual and the community at large, who are then protected from the possible theft of their goods.<ref>http://www.idaat.org/files/newsletters_file-8.pdf</ref><ref>Lancashire Constabulary-Harm Reduction in the Community page 7</ref>

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Swiss authorities ran the ZIPP-AIDS (Zurich Intervention Pilot Project), handing out free syringes in the officially tolerated drug scene in [[Platzspitz park]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}
