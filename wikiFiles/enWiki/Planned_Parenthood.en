'''Planned Parenthood Federation of America''' ('''PPFA'''), commonly shortened to '''Planned Parenthood''', is the U.S. affiliate of the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] (IPPF) and one of its larger members. PPFA is a [[non-profit organization]] providing [[reproductive health]] and maternal and child health services. The Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Inc. (PPAF) is a related organization which lobbies for [[pro-choice]] legislation, comprehensive [[sex education]], and access to affordable [[health care]] in the United States.

Planned Parenthood is the largest U.S. provider of reproductive health services, including cancer screening, [[HIV]] screening and counseling, contraception, and [[abortion]].<ref name="eckholm"/><ref>Largest provider of reproductive health services:

The organization has its roots in [[Brooklyn, New York]], where [[Margaret Sanger]] opened the country's first birth-control clinic. Sanger founded the [[American Birth Control League]] in 1921, which in 1942 became part of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Since then, Planned Parenthood has grown to have over 820 clinic locations in the U.S., with a total budget of US $1 billion. PPFA provides an array of services to over three million people in the United States, and supports services for over one million clients outside the United States.

==Funding==
[[File:Planned Parenthood Federation of America headquarters Washington DC.JPG|thumb|right|Planned Parenthood headquarters on [[Massachusetts Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Massachusetts Avenue]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
Planned Parenthood has received federal funding since 1970, when President [[Richard Nixon]] signed into law the [[Family Planning Services and Population Research Act]], amending the [[Public Health Service Act]]. [[Title X]] of that law provides funding for family planning services, including contraception and family planning information. The law enjoyed bipartisan support from liberals who saw contraception access as increasing families' control over their lives, and conservatives who saw it as a way to keep people off welfare. Nixon described Title X funding as based on the premise that "no American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance because of her economic condition."<ref name="halloran">{{Cite news |publisher=[[NPR]] |title=Abortion Foes Target Family Planning Program |first=Liz |last=Halloran |date=March 21, 2011 |url=http://www.npr.org/2011/03/21/134662664/abortion-foes-target-family-planning-program}}</ref>

In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011, total(consolidated) revenue was $201 million: clinic revenue totaling $2 million, grants and donations of $190 million, investment income of $2 million, and $7 million other income.<ref>{{cite web|title=Planned Parenthood - Annual Report 2010-2011|url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/annual-report-4661.htm|publisher=Planned Parenthood|accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref>  Approximately two-thirds of the revenue is put towards the provision of health services, while non-medical services such as sex education and public policy work make up another 16%; management expenses, fundraising, and international family planning programs account for most of the rest.

Planned Parenthood receives about a third of its money in government grants and contracts (about $360 million in 2009).<ref name= thorn>{{cite news|url= http://www.npr.org/2011/04/13/135354952/planned-parenthood-makes-abortion-foes-see-red

==Before the U.S. Supreme Court==
[[File:Roevwade.jpg|thumb|left|Former Planned Parenthood President [[Gloria Feldt]] with Congressman [[Albert Wynn]] in front of the U.S. Supreme Court]]
Planned Parenthood regional chapters have been active in the American courts. A number of cases in which Planned Parenthood has been a party have reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]. Notable among these cases is the 1992 case ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', the case that sets forth the current constitutional abortion standard. In this case, "Planned Parenthood" was the Southeast Pennsylvania Chapter, and "Casey" was [[Robert P. Casey|Robert Casey]], the governor of [[Pennsylvania]]. The ultimate ruling was split, and ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' was narrowed but upheld in an opinion written by [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], [[Anthony Kennedy]], and [[David Souter]]. [[Harry Blackmun]] and [[John Paul Stevens]] concurred with the main decision in separately written opinions. The Supreme Court struck down spousal consent requirements for married women to obtain abortions, but found no "undue burden"—an alternative to [[strict scrutiny]] which tests the allowable limitations on rights protected under the Constitution—from the other statutory requirements. Dissenting were [[William Rehnquist]], [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Clarence Thomas]], and [[Byron White]]. Blackmun, Rehnquist, and White were the only justices who voted on the original ''Roe v. Wade'' decision in 1973 who were still on the Supreme Court to rule on this case, and their votes on this case were consistent with their votes on the original decision that legalized abortion.<ref>[http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0505_0833_ZS.html ''Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey'']</ref> Only Blackmun voted to maintain ''Roe v. Wade'' in its entirety.

Other related cases include:
* ''[[Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth]]'' (1976). Planned Parenthood challenged the constitutionality of a Missouri law encompassing parental consent, spousal consent, clinic bookkeeping and allowed abortion methods. Portions of the challenged law were held to be constitutional, others not.<ref>[http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0428_0052_ZS.html Syllabus, Opinion, one Concurrence, and two Concurrence & Dissent statements]</ref>
* ''Planned Parenthood Association of Kansas City v. Ashcroft'' (1983). Planned Parenthood challenged the constitutionality of a Missouri law encompassing parental consent, clinic record keeping, and hospitalization requirements. Most of the challenged law was held to be constitutional.<ref>{{cite pmid|12041276}}</ref>
* ''Planned Parenthood v. ACLA'' (2001). The American Coalition of Life Activists (ACLA) released a flier and [[Wanted poster|"Wanted" posters]] with complete personal information about doctors who performed abortions. A civil jury and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals both found that the material was indeed "true threats" and not protected speech.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/ilaw/Cybercrime/planned-parenthood.html |title=Planned Parenthood v.

*''[[Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood]]'' (2003). Planned Parenthood sued Attorney General Gonzales for an injunction against the enforcement of the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003]]. Planned Parenthood argued the act was unconstitutional because it violated the Fifth Amendment, namely in that it was overly vague, violated women's constitutional right to have access to abortion, and did not include language for exceptions for the health of the mother. Both the district court and the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2006/2006_05_1382 |title=Gonzales v.

Planned Parenthood conducted a frame-by-frame analysis of the recordings, and said they found instances of "editing that dramatically alter[ed] the meaning of the recorded conversations."<ref>{{cite news|title = Behind the Assault on Planned Parenthood | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/24/planned-parenthood-funding_n_827886.html |publisher = Huffington Post; AOL News|date = 2011-02-25|accessdate = 2011-04-19|first=Ryan|last=Grim}}</ref>

===State and local court cases against Planned Parenthood===
In some states, anti-abortion [[Attorney General|Attorneys General]] have subpoenaed medical records of patients treated by Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood has gone to court to keep from turning over these records, citing [[medical privacy]] and concerns about the motivation for seeking the records.<ref name="kansas-ag"/>

In 2006, [[Kansas]] Attorney General [[Phill Kline]], a strongly anti-abortion Republican, released some sealed patient records obtained from Planned Parenthood to the public. His actions were described as "troubling" by the state Supreme Court, but ultimately Planned Parenthood was compelled to turn over the medical records, albeit with more stringent court-mandated privacy safeguards for the patients involved.<ref name="kansas-ag">{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | first = Jori | last = Rudoren | title = Kansas' Top Court Limits Abortion Record Search | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/04/national/04kansas.html | date = February 4, 2006 | accessdate = September 19, 2011}}</ref> In 2007, Kline's successor, [[Paul J. Morrison]], notified the clinic that no criminal charges would be filed after a three-year investigation, as "an objective, unbiased and thorough examination" showed no wrongdoing. Morrison stated that he believed Kline had politicized the attorney general's office.<ref>{{cite news | last = | title = Planned Parenthood Clinic Is Cleared in Kansas Probe | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 2007-06-28 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/27/AR2007062702312.html | accessdate = 2010-12-22}}</ref> In 2012, a Kansas district attorney dropped all of the remaining criminal charges against the Kansas City-area Planned Parenthood clinic accused of performing illegal abortions, citing a lack of evidence of wrongdoing.<ref name="kansas-dropped">{{cite web|last=Hanna|first=John|title=Kansas district attorney drops remaining 32 criminal charges against Planned Parenthood clinic|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/kansas-district-attorney-drops-remaining-32-criminal-charges-against-planned-parenthood-clinic/2012/08/17/6f4c8908-e8c8-11e1-9739-eef99c5fb285_story.html|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|work= [[Washington Post]]|accessdate= August 17, 2012 | date = August 17, 2012}}</ref> In all, the Planned Parenthood clinic had faced 107 criminal charges from Kline and other Kansas prosecutors, all of which were ultimately dropped for lack of evidence.<ref name="kansas-dropped"/>

On December 31, 2012, Judge Gary Harger ruled [[Texas]] may exclude otherwise qualified doctors and clinics from receiving state funding if they advocate for abortion rights.<ref>{{cite web|title=JUDGE SAYS TEXAS CAN CUT OFF FUNDING FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/judge-says-texas-can-cut-off-funding-for-planned-parenthood/|publisher=The Blaze|accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref>
