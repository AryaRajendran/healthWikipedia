The '''vestibular nerve''' is one of the two branches of the [[Vestibulocochlear nerve]] (the [[cochlear nerve]] being the other). In humans the vestibular nerve transmits sensory information transmitted by vestibular hair cells located in the two otolith organs (the utricle and the saccule) and the three [[semicircular canal]]s via the [[vestibular ganglion]]. Information from the otolith organs reflects gravity and linear accelerations of the head. Information from the semicircular canals reflects rotational movement of the head. Both are necessary for the sensation of body position and gaze stability in relation to a moving environment. 

Axons of the vestibular nerve synapse in the [[vestibular nucleus]] on the lateral floor and wall of the [[fourth ventricle]] in the [[pons]] and [[medulla oblongata|medulla]]. 

It arises from [[bipolar cells]] in the [[vestibular ganglion]], ganglion of Scarpa, which is situated in the upper part of the outer end of the [[internal auditory meatus]].

==Branches==
The peripheral fibers divide into three branches (some sources list two):<ref>[http://www.emedicine.com/ent/topic693.htm eMedicine - Anatomy of the Vestibular System : Article by Steve C Lee<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 
* the ''superior branch'' passes through the foramina in the area vestibularis superior and ends in the [[Utricle (ear)|utricle]] and in the [[ampullae]] of the superior and [[lateral semicircular duct]]s;
* the fibers of the ''inferior branch'' traverse the foramina in the area vestibularis inferior and end in the [[saccule]];
* the ''posterior branch'' runs through the [[foramen singulare]] and supplies the ampulla of the [[posterior semicircular duct]].

==Anatomy and function==
The primary role of the vestibular nerve is to transform vestibular information (related to balance) into an egocentric frame of reference based on the position of the head in relation to the body.<ref name=Osler>{{cite journal|last=Osler|first=Callum|coauthors=Reynolds, Raymond|title=Dynamic transformation of vestibular signals for orientation|date=26|year=2012|month=August|issue=Exp Brain Res|doi=10.1007/s00221-012-3250-1|accessdate=11/10/12}}</ref> The vestibular nerve dynamically updates the frame of reference of motor movement based on the orientation of the head in relation to the body. As an example, when standing upright and facing forward, if you wished to tilt your head to the right you would need to perform a slight leftward motor movement (shifting more of your weight to your left side) to maintain balance. While the head is still in motion, the response magnitude of alteration to motor coordinates is significantly reduced when compared to when the head is fixated in one position.<ref name=Osler />

==Symptoms of damage==
Due to its role in transforming motor coordinates, the vestibular nerve implicitly plays a role in maintaining stable blood pressure during movement, maintaining balance control, spatial memory and spatial navigation.<ref name=McCall>{{cite journal|last=McCall|first=Andrew|coauthors=Yates, Bill|title=Compensation following bilateral vestibular damage|journal=frontiers in NEUROLOGY|date=27|year=2011|month=December|doi=10.3389/fneur.2011.00088|url=http://www.frontiersin.org/Neuro-otology/10.3389/fneur.2011.00088/abstract|accessdate=11/10/12}}</ref> The most common causes of damage to the vestibular nerve are exposure to ototoxic antibiotics, [[Ménière's disease]], [[encephalitis]] and some rare autoimmune disorders.<ref name=McCall /> Typically, patients with a damaged nerve suffer from acute attacks of [[vertigo]] accompanied by nausea/vomiting, inability to maintain posture and horizontal [[nystagmus]].<ref name=Fundakowski>{{cite journal|last=Fundakowski|first=Christopher|coauthors=Joshua Anderson; Simon Angeli|title=Cross-Sectional Vestibular Nerve Analysis in Vestibular Neuritis|journal=Annals of Otology, Rhinology & Laryngology|year=2012|volume=121(7)|pages=466–470|accessdate=11/10/12}}</ref>

==Rehabilitation==
Rapid compensation to damage of the vestibular nerve occurs within seven to ten days of receiving the damage. A small percentage of patients with damage to the vestibular nerve experience recurrent symptoms.<ref name=Fundakowski />  These patients have not been able to undergo vestibular compensation and are left with long-term attacks of vertigo.  By administering betahistine to the damaged nerve over a long period of time, the process of vestibular compensation can be accelerated to alleviate symptoms. Patients can also learn strategies to recover their balance through physical therapy.<ref name=Georgescu>{{cite journal|last=Georgescu|first=Madalina|coauthors=Sorina Stoian, Carmen Mogoanta|title=Vestibulary rehabilitation – election treatment method for compensating vestibular impairment|journal=Romanian Journal of Morphology & Embryology|date=27|year=2012|month=August|volume=53(3)|pages=651–656|accessdate=11/10/12}}</ref>
