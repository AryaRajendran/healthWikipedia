'''Endometrial cancer''' refers to several types of [[cancer|malignancies]] that arise from the [[endometrium]], or lining, of the [[uterus]]. Endometrial cancers are the most common gynecologic cancers in the United States, with over 35,000 women diagnosed each year. The incidence is on a slow rise secondary to the obesity epidemic.  The most common subtype, ''endometrioid adenocarcinoma,'' typically occurs within a few decades of [[menopause]], is associated with obesity, excessive [[estrogen]] exposure, often develops in the setting of [[endometrial hyperplasia]], and presents most often with [[vaginal bleeding]]. Endometrial carcinoma is the third most common cause of gynecologic cancer death (behind [[ovarian cancer|ovarian]] and [[cervical cancer]]). A total abdominal [[hysterectomy]] (surgical removal of the uterus) with bilateral salpingo-[[oophorectomy]] is the most common therapeutic approach.

Endometrial cancer may sometimes be referred to as ''[[uterine cancer]].'' However, different cancers may develop not only from  the endometrium itself but also from other tissues of the uterus, including [[cervical cancer]], [[uterine sarcoma|sarcoma]] of the [[myometrium]], and [[trophoblastic disease]].

==Classification==
===Carcinoma===
Most endometrial cancers are [[carcinoma]]s (usually [[adenocarcinoma]]s), meaning that they originate from the single layer of [[epithelium|epithelial]] cells that line the endometrium and form the endometrial glands. There are many [[histopathology|microscopic]] subtypes of ''endometrial carcinoma'', including the common ''endometrioid'' type, in which the cancer cells grow in patterns reminiscent of normal endometrium, and the far more aggressive ''[[uterine papillary serous carcinoma|papillary serous carcinoma]]'' and ''clear cell'' endometrial carcinomas. Some authorities have proposed that endometrial carcinomas be classified into two pathogenetic groups:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bokhman JV |title=Two pathogenetic types of endometrial carcinoma |journal=Gynecol. Oncol. |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=10–7 |year=1983 |pmid=6822361 |doi=10.1016/0090-8258(83)90111-7}}</ref>

*'''Type I: ''' These cancers occur most commonly in pre- and peri-[[menopause|menopausal]] women, often with a history of unopposed [[estrogen]] exposure and/or [[endometrial hyperplasia]]. They are often minimally invasive into the underlying uterine wall, are of the ''[[Grading (tumors)|low-grade]] endometrioid'' type, and carry a good prognosis.

*'''Type II:''' These cancers occur in older, post-menopausal women, are more common in [[African-Americans]], are not associated with increased exposure to estrogen, and carry a poorer prognosis. They include:
:* the ''[[Grading (tumors)|high-grade]] endometrioid'' cancer,
:* the [[uterine papillary serous carcinoma]],
:* the [[uterine clear cell carcinoma]].

FIGO grading of Endometrial Carcinoma

G1: Highly differentiated (composed of  glands and 5% of lesion is of solid growth pattern).
G2: Moderately differentiated ( 6%-50% of lesion composed of solid sheets of cells).
G3: Undifferentiated ( > 50% of lesion composed of solid sheets of cells).

===Sarcoma===
{{main|Uterine sarcoma}}
In contrast to ''endometrial carcinomas'', the uncommon ''endometrial stromal [[sarcomas]]'' are cancers that originate in the non-glandular [[connective tissue]] of the endometrium. Uterine [[carcinosarcoma]], formerly called ''[[Mixed Müllerian tumor|Malignant mixed müllerian tumor]]'', is a rare uterine cancer that contains cancerous cells of both glandular and [[sarcoma]]tous appearance - in this case, the cell of origin is unknown.<ref name="Weidner's">{{cite book |author=Richard Cote, Saul Suster, Lawrence Weiss, Noel Weidner (Editor) |title=Modern Surgical Pathology (2 Volume Set) |publisher=W B Saunders |location=London |year= 2002|pages= |isbn=0-7216-7253-1 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
*'''[[Vaginal bleeding]] and/or spotting in postmenopausal women'''.
*Abnormal uterine bleeding, abnormal menstrual periods.
*Bleeding between normal periods in premenopausal women in women older than 40: extremely long, heavy, or frequent episodes of bleeding (may indicate premalignant changes).
*[[Anemia]], caused by chronic loss of blood. (This may occur if the woman has ignored symptoms of prolonged or frequent abnormal menstrual bleeding.)
*Lower [[abdomen|abdominal]] pain or pelvic cramping.
*Thin white or clear [[vaginal discharge]] in postmenopausal women.

*heavy daily alcohol consumption (possibly a risk factor) <ref>"Thirteen studies to date have reported on the relationship between endometrial cancer and alcohol consumption. Only two of these studies have reported that endometrial cancer incidence is associated with consumption of alcohol; all the others have reported either no definite association, or an inverse association." (Six studies showed an inverse association; that is, drinking was associated with a lower risk of endometrial cancer) "…if such an inverse association exists, it appears to be more pronounced in younger, or premenopausal, women."[3] "Our results suggest that only alcohol consumption equivalent to 2 or more drinks per day increases risk of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women."</ref>

==Diagnosis==
===Clinical evaluation===
Routine screening of asymptomatic women is not indicated, since the disease is highly curable in its early stages. Results from a [[pelvic examination]] are frequently normal, especially in the early stages of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced.

*A [[Pap smear]] may be either normal or show abnormal cellular changes.  A Pap smear is used to screen for cervical cancer not endometrial cancer.
*Office endometrial biopsy is the traditional diagnostic method. Both endometrial and endocervical material should be sampled.
*If endometrial biopsy does not yield sufficient diagnostic material, a [[dilation and curettage]] (D&C) is necessary for diagnosing the cancer.
*[[Hysteroscopy]] allows the direct visualization of the uterine cavity and can be used to detect the presence of lesions or tumours. It also permits the doctor to obtain cell samples with minimal damage to the endometrial lining (unlike blind [[Dilation and curettage|D&C]]).
*[[Endometrial biopsy]] or [[Needle aspiration biopsy|aspiration]] may assist the diagnosis.
*Transvaginal [[ultrasound]] to evaluate the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used to evaluate for endometrial cancer.
* Ongoing research suggests that serum p53 antibody may hold value in identifying high-risk endometrial cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yamazawa | first1 = K | last2 = Shimada | first2 = H | last3 = Hirai | first3 = M | last4 = Hirashiki | first4 = K | last5 = Ochiai | first5 = T | last6 = Ishikura | first6 = H | last7 = Shozu | first7 = M | last8 = Isaka | first8 = K | title = Serum p53 antibody as a diagnostic marker of high-risk endometrial cancer. | journal = American journal of obstetrics and gynecology | volume = 197 | issue = 5 | pages = 505.e1–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17980190 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2007.04.033 }}</ref>

===Pathology===
[[File:Endometrial adenocarcinoma (1).jpg|thumb|Endometrial adenocarcinoma]]
The histopathology of endometrial cancers is highly diverse. The most common finding is a ''well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma'', which is composed of numerous, small, crowded glands with varying degrees of nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, and stratification. This often appears on a background of endometrial hyperplasia. Frank adenocarcinoma may be distinguished from atypical hyperplasia by the finding of clear stromal invasion, or "back-to-back" glands which represent nondestructive replacement of the endometrial stroma by the cancer. With progression of the disease, the myometrium is infiltrated.<ref name="Weidner's"/> However, other subtypes of endometrial cancer exist and carry a less favorable diagnosis such as the [[uterine papillary serous carcinoma]] and the clear cell carcinoma.

===Further evaluation===
Patients with newly-diagnosed endometrial cancer do not routinely undergo imaging studies, such as [[CT scan]]s, to evaluate for extent of disease, since this is of low yield.  Preoperative evaluation should include a complete medical history and physical examination, pelvic examination and rectal examination with [[stool guaiac test]], chest X-ray, complete blood count, and blood chemistry tests, including liver function tests. Colonoscopy is recommended if the stool is guaiac positive or the woman has symptoms, due to the etiologic factors common to both endometrial cancer and [[colon cancer]]. The tumor marker '''[[CA-125]]''' is sometimes checked, since this can predict advanced stage disease.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dotters | first1 = DJ | title = Preoperative CA 125 in endometrial cancer: is it useful? | journal = American journal of obstetrics and gynecology | volume = 182 | issue = 6 | pages = 1328–34 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10871446 | doi = 10.1067/mob.2000.106251 }}</ref> In addition to this, both [[Dilation and curettage|D&C]] and Pipelle biopsy curettage give 65-70% positive predictive value. But most important of these is [[hysteroscopy]] which gives 90-95% positive predictive value.

===Staging===
Endometrial carcinoma is surgically staged using the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics|FIGO]] [[cancer staging]] system.

The 2010 FIGO staging system is as follows:
Carcinoma of the Endometrium
*IA        Tumor confined to the uterus, no or < ½ myometrial invasion
*IB        Tumor confined to the uterus, > ½ myometrial invasion
*II        Tumor involves the uterus and the cervical stroma
*IIIA      Tumor invades serosa or adnexa
*IIIB      Vaginal and/or parametrial involvement
*IIIC1     Pelvic lymph node involvement
*IIIC2     Para-aortic lymph node involvement, with or without pelvic node involvement
*IVA       Tumor invasion bladder mucosa and/or bowel mucosa
*IVB       Distant metastases including abdominal metastases and/or inguinal lymph nodes

==Treatment==
The primary treatment is surgical.  Surgical treatment should consist of, at least, cytologic sampling of the peritoneal fluid, abdominal exploration, palpation and biopsy of suspicious lymph nodes, abdominal [[hysterectomy]], and removal of both [[ovary|ovaries]] (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy).  Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is sometimes performed for tumors that have high risk features, such as pathologic grade 3 serous or clear-cell tumors, invasion of more than 1/2 the myometrium, or extension to the cervix or adnexa.  Sometimes, removal of the [[Greater omentum|omentum]] is also performed.

[[Hysterectomy|Abdominal hysterectomy]] is recommended over [[Hysterectomy|vaginal hysterectomy]] because it affords the opportunity to examine and obtain [[peritoneal washing|washing]]s of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer.

Women with stage 1 disease who are at increased risk for recurrence and those with stage 2 disease are often offered surgery in combination with [[radiation therapy]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chong | first1 = I | last2 = Hoskin | first2 = PJ | title = Vaginal vault brachytherapy as sole postoperative treatment for low-risk endometrial cancer. | journal = Brachytherapy | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 195–9 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18358790 | doi = 10.1016/j.brachy.2008.01.001 }}</ref> [[Chemotherapy]] may be considered in some cases, especially for those with stage 3 and 4 disease. [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|Hormonal therapy]] with progestins and antiestrogens has been used for the treatment of endometrial stromal sarcomas.<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_4X_Hormone_Therapy_63.asp?sitearea] American Cancer Society - Uterine Sarcomas - Hormonal Therapy (accessed 5-25-07)</ref>

The antibody [[Herceptin]], which is used to treat breast cancers that overexpress the [[HER2/neu]] protein, has been tried with some success in a phase II trial in women with [[uterine papillary serous carcinoma]]s that overexpress HER2/neu.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Santin AD, Bellone S, Roman JJ, McKenney JK, Pecorelli S.|title=Trastuzumab treatment in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma overexpressing HER2/neu|journal= Int J Gynaecol Obstet |volume= 102 |issue= 2 |pages= 128–31 |year= 2008 |pmid= 18555254 |doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2008.04.008}}</ref>

===Complications of treatment===
*[[Uterine perforation]] may occur during a [[dilatation and curettage]] (D&C) or an endometrial biopsy.

==Prognosis==
While endometrial cancers are 40% more common in Caucasian women, an African American woman who is diagnosed with uterine cancer is twice as likely to die (possibly due to the higher frequency of aggressive subtypes in that population, but more probably due to delay in the diagnosis).

===Survival rates===
The 5-year survival rates for endometrial adenocarcinoma following appropriate treatment are:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/EndometrialCancer/DetailedGuide/endometrial-uterine-cancer-staging |title=How Is Endometrial Cancer Staged? |author=American Cancer Society |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2010-03-09 [Note Stage I definitions in ref differed from those used on Wiki page, so adjusted table labels from 0, IA, IB, to IA, IB, IC matching definitions used here] }}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
It's the most frequent cancer occurring in the female genital tract in the United States and many other Western countries.
It appears most frequently between ages of 55 and 65, and uncommon below 40.
There are two pictures of this disease, perimenopausal women with estrogen excess and in older women with endometrial atrophy.<ref>DiCristofano A, Ellenson LH: Endometrial carcinoma.
