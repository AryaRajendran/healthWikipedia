A '''venous lake''' (which are also known as "Phlebectases"<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''.

Though these lesions may resemble [[nodular melanoma]], the lack of [[induration]], slow growth, and lightening appearance upon [[diascopy]] suggest against it, and indicate a vascular lesion.<ref name="Wolff">Wolff and Johnson. ''Fitzpatrick's Color Atlas and Synopsis of Clinical Dermatology.'' The McGraw-Hill Companies. 2005. Page 192. ISBN 0-07-144019-4.</ref>  Additionally, lack of pulsation distinguishes this lesion of the lower lip from a tortuous segment of the [[inferior labial artery]].<ref name="Sauer" />

==Cause==
The cause is unknown; however it is thought to be associated with sun exposure, leading to a dilated blood-filled vascular channel<ref name="Habif" /> "...lined with a singled layer of flattened [[endothelial]] cells and a thin wall of fibrous tissue filled with red blood cells."<ref name="Wolff" />

==Treatment==
Treatment may be requested for cosmetic reasons. Traditional techniques such as surgical excision are effective but will leave a scar. Laser therapy has become the mainstay of therapy.
Published research suggests that the Long Pulsed Nd:YAG laser is a very effective, with a clearance rate of 94% following a single treatment.  In this study no scarring or other complications were reported.
