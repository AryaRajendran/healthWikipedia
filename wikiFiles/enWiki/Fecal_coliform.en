A '''fecal coliform''' (''brit.'' '''faecal coliform''') is a [[Facultative anaerobic organism|facultatively anaerobic]], [[bacillus|rod-shaped]], [[gram-negative]], [[spore|non-sporulating]] [[bacterium]]. Fecal coliforms are capable of growth in the presence of [[bile|bile salts]] or similar surface agents, are [[oxidase|oxidase negative]], and produce acid and gas from [[lactose]] within 48 hours at 44 ± 0.5°C.<ref name="doyle2006">Doyle, M. P., and M. C. Erickson. 2006. [http://www.saverawmilk.org/documents/Fecal_Coliform_Test.pdf "Closing the door on the fecal coliform assay."] ''[[Microbe Magazine|Microbe]]'' 1:162-163. {{ISSN|1558-7460}}.</ref>

[[Coliform bacteria]] include [[genera]] that originate in [[feces]] (e.g. ''[[Escherichia]]'') as well as genera not of fecal origin (e.g. ''[[Klebsiella]]'', ''[[Citrobacter]]'').  The assay is intended to be an indicator of fecal contamination; more specifically of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' which is an indicator microorganism for other [[pathogen]]s that may be present in feces. Presence of fecal coliforms in [[water]] may not be directly harmful, and does not necessarily indicate the presence of feces.<ref name="doyle2006" />

== Fecal bacteria as indicator of water quality ==
=== Basics of fecal coliforms ===
In general, increased levels of fecal coliforms provide a warning of failure in [[water purification|water treatment]], a break in the integrity of the [[Water supply network#Water distribution network|distribution system]],  possible [[contamination]] with pathogens.  When levels are high there may be an elevated risk of waterborne [[gastroenteritis]].  Tests for the bacteria are cheap, reliable and rapid (1-day incubation).

=== Potential sources of fecal coliform bacteria in water ===
The presence of fecal coliform in [[Freshwater ecosystem|aquatic environments]] may indicate that the water has been contaminated with the fecal material of humans or other animals.  Fecal coliform bacteria can enter [[river]]s through direct discharge of waste from mammals and birds, from [[agricultural]] and [[urban runoff|storm runoff]], and from human [[sewage]].  However, their presence may also be the result of plant material, and [[Pulp (paper)|
pulp]] or [[paper mill]] [[effluent]].<ref name="doyle2006" />

==== Human sewage ====
Failing home [[septic tank|septic systems]] can allow coliforms in the effluent to flow into the [[water table]], [[aquifer]]s, [[drainage]] ditches and nearby [[surface water]]s.  Sewage connections that are connected to [[storm drain]] pipes can also allow human sewage into surface waters.  Some older industrial cities, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest of the [[United States]], use a [[combined sewer]] system to handle waste.  A combined sewer carries both domestic sewage and stormwater. During high rainfall periods, a combined sewer can become overloaded and overflow to a nearby stream or river, bypassing [[sewage treatment|treatment]].

====Animals====
Pets, especially [[dog]]s, can contribute to fecal contamination of surface waters.  Runoff from roads, parking lots, and yards can carry animal wastes to streams through storm sewers. [[Bird]]s can be a significant source of fecal coliform bacteria.  [[Swan]]s, [[geese]], [[seagull]]s, and other [[waterfowl]] can all elevate bacterial counts, especially in [[wetland]]s, [[lake]]s, [[pond]]s, and rivers.

====Agriculture====
Agricultural practices such as allowing [[livestock]] to graze near water bodies, spreading [[manure]] as [[fertilizer]] on fields during wet periods, using sewage sludge biosolids and allowing livestock watering in streams can all contribute to fecal coliform contamination.

===Problems resulting from fecal contamination of water===
====Human health hazards====
Large quantities of fecal coliform bacteria in water are not harmful according to some authorities, but may indicate a higher risk of [[pathogens]] being present in the water.<ref>Fresno County Department of Public Health. Fresno, CA (2009).[http://www.co.fresno.ca.us/uploadedFiles/Departments/Public_Health/Divisions/EH/content/Water_Surveillance/content/Fecal_Coliform_Notice_-_Private_Wells.pdf "E. coli or Fecal Coliform Bacteria Contamination in Your Water Supply."] Notice distributed to private well owners.</ref> Some waterborne pathogenic diseases that may coincide with fecal coliform contamination include ear infections, [[dysentery]], [[typhoid fever]], viral and bacterial gastroenteritis, and [[hepatitis A]]. The presence of fecal coliform tends to affect humans more than it does aquatic creatures, though not exclusively.

====Effects on the environment====
Untreated [[organic matter]] that contains fecal coliform can be harmful to the environment. [[Aerobic decomposition]] of this material can reduce [[dissolved oxygen]] levels if discharged into rivers or waterways. This may reduce the oxygen level enough to kill [[fish]] and other aquatic life. Reduction of fecal coliform in [[wastewater]] may require the use of [[chlorine#Purification and disinfection|chlorine]] and other [[disinfectant]] chemicals. Such materials may kill the fecal coliform and disease bacteria. They also kill bacteria essential to the proper balance of the aquatic environment, endangering the survival of species dependent on those bacteria. So higher levels of fecal coliform require higher levels of chlorine, threatening those aquatic organisms.

==Removal and treatment==
Fecal coliform, like other bacteria, can usually be inhibited in growth by boiling water or by treating with chlorine.  Washing thoroughly with soap after contact with contaminated water can also help prevent infections.  Gloves should always be worn when testing for fecal coliform. Municipalities that maintain a public water supply will typically monitor and treat for fecal coliforms. {{Further|Water purification}}

==Testing==
===Public health risk monitoring ===
In waters of the U.S., [[Canada]] and other countries, [[water quality]] is monitored to protect the health of the general public. Bacteria contamination is one monitored pollutant. In the U.S., fecal coliform testing is one of the nine tests of water quality that form the overall water-quality rating in a process used by U.S. EPA. The fecal coliform assay should only be used to assess the presence of fecal matter in situations where fecal coliforms of non-fecal origin are not commonly encountered.<ref name="doyle2006" /> EPA has approved a number of different methods to analyze samples for bacteria.

===Analysis===
{{main|Bacteriological water analysis}}
Bacteria reproduce rapidly if conditions are right for growth.  Most bacteria grow best in dark, warm, moist environments with food.  Some bacteria form [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] as they multiply which may grow large enough to be seen.  By growing and counting colonies of fecal coliform bacteria from a sample of water, the amount of bacteria originally present can be determined.

[[Microfiltration|Membrane filtration]] is the method of choice for the analysis of fecal coliforms in water.  Samples to be tested are passed through a filter of particular pore size (generally 0.45 [[micrometre]]).  The microorganisms present in the water remain on the filter surface.  When the filter is placed in a sterile [[petri dish]] and saturated with an appropriate [[growth medium|medium]], growth of the desired organisms is encouraged, while that of other organisms is suppressed.  Each cell develops into a separate colony, which can be counted directly, and the results calculated as microbial density.  Sample volumes of 1 ml and 10 ml will be used for the water testing, with the goal of achieving a final desirable colony density range of 20 to 60 colonies per filter.  Contaminated sources may require dilution to achieve a "countable" membrane. 

A 100 ml volume of a water sample is drawn through a membrane filter (0.45&nbsp;µm pore size) through the use of a vacuum pump.  The filter is placed on a petri dish containing M-FC [[agar]] and incubated for 24 hours at 44.5 °C (112.1 degrees F).  This elevated temperature heat shocks non-fecal bacteria and suppresses their growth.  As the fecal coliform colonies grow they produce an acid (through fermenting lactose) that reacts with the aniline dye in the agar thus giving the colonies their blue color. 

Newer methods for coliform detection are based on specific enzyme substrates as indicators of coliforms.  These assays make use of a sugar linked to a dye which, when acted on by the enzyme [[beta-galactosidase]], produces a characteristic color.  The enzyme beta-galactosidase is a marker for coliforms generally and may be assayed by hydrolysis of the sugar glucoside o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactose.  Assays typically include a second sugar linked to a different dye which, when acted on by the enzyme beta-glucuronidase, produces a fluorescent product.  Because ''E. coli'' produces both beta-galactosidase and [[beta-glucuronidase]], a combination of these two dyes makes possible the unique ability to use one test to differentiate and quantify coliforms and ''E. coli''.

===EPA testing requirements===
The 1989 EPA Total Coliform Rule (TCR) imposed major monitoring changes for [[public water system]]s.<ref>EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw000/disinfection/tcr/regulation.html "Total Coliform Rule."] Updated 2007-07-13.</ref> The testing requirements for drinking water under the TCR are markedly increased over previous requirements and thus are more thorough.  Not only is the number of routine coliform tests increased, especially for smaller water utilities, but the regulation also requires automatic repeat testing from all sources that show a total coliform positive (known as triggered source water monitoring).

As of 2009, EPA is working on revisions to the TCR. Issues being considered by the Agency include sampling locations, sampling frequency and timing, analytical methods and corrective actions to be taken by public water systems.<ref>EPA.
