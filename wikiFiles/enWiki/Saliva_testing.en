'''Saliva testing''' is a [[medical test|diagnostic technique]] that involves [[laboratory]] analysis of [[saliva]] to identify markers of [[endocrine disorders|endocrine]], [[immunology|immunologic]], [[inflammatory disease|inflammatory]], [[infectious disease|infectious]], and other types of conditions.  Saliva is a useful biological fluid for assaying [[steroid hormone]]s such as [[cortisol]], genetic material like [[ribonucleic acid|RNA]], proteins such as [[enzyme]]s and [[antibodies]], and a variety of other substances. Saliva testing is used to screen for or diagnose numerous conditions and disease states, including [[Cushing's disease]], [[anovulation]], [[HIV]], [[cancer]], [[parasite]]s, [[hypogonadism]], and [[allergies]]. Salivary testing has even been used by the U.S. government to assess [[circadian rhythm]] shifts in astronauts before flight and to evaluate hormonal profiles of soldiers undergoing military survival training.<ref>Biol Psychiatry. 2000 May 15;47(10):891-901.

Proponents of saliva testing cite its ease of collection, safety, non-invasiveness, affordability, accuracy, and capacity to circumvent [[venipuncture]] as the primary advantages when compared to blood testing and other types of [[diagnostic test]]ing. Additionally, since multiple samples can be readily obtained, saliva testing is particularly useful for performing [[chronobiology|chronobiological]] assessments that span hours, days, or weeks.

Salivary testing has been used for three decades.{{cn|date=January 2013}} Initial studies focused primarily on detection of steroid hormones and antibodies in the saliva. Recent applications emphasize the development of increasingly sophisticated techniques to detect additional proteins, genetic material, and markers of nutritional status.  According to Wong, scientists are now viewing saliva as “a valuable biofluid…with the potential to extract more data than is possible currently with other diagnostic methods.”<ref name=Wong>J Am Dent Assoc. 2006 Mar;137(3):313-21. Salivary diagnostics powered by nanotechnologies, proteomics and genomics. Wong DT. School of Dentistry, Dental Research Institute, University of California, Los Angeles 73-017 CHS, 10833 Le Conte Ave., Los Angeles, Calif 90095, USA. PMID 16570464</ref>

==Technique==
Most saliva testing is performed using [[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA), [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), or any number of newer technologies such as fiber-optic-based detection. All of these methods enable detection of specific molecules like [[cortisol]], [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP), or [[secretory immunoglobulin A|secretory IgA]]. This type of testing typically involves collection of a small amount of saliva into a sterile tube followed by processing at a remote laboratory. Some methods of testing involve collecting saliva using an absorbent pad, applying a chemical solution, and monitoring for color change to indicate a positive or negative result. This method is commonly used as a [[point-of-care testing|point-of-care (POC) technique]] to screen for HIV. Researchers are currently examining the expanding role of saliva testing as part of routine dental or medical office examinations where saliva collection is simple to perform.<ref name=Wong/>

==Physiologic basis==
[[File:Illu quiz hn 02.jpg|thumb|[[Salivary glands]]: 1.[[parotid gland|parotid]], 2.[[submandibular]], 3.[[sublingual]].]]
Humans have three major [[salivary gland]]s: [[parotid gland|parotid]], [[submandibular gland|submandibular]], and [[sublingual gland|sublingual]]. These glands, along with additional [[minor salivary glands]], secrete a rich mixture of biological chemicals, [[electrolyte]]s, proteins, genetic material, [[polysaccharide]]s, and other molecules. Most of these substances enter the salivary gland [[acinus]] and duct system from the surrounding capillaries via the intervening tissue fluid, although some substances are produced within the glands themselves. The level of each salivary component varies considerably depending on the health status of the individual and the presence of disease (oral or systemic). By measuring these components in the saliva, it is possible to screen for a variety of infections, allergies, hormonal disturbances, and [[neoplasm]]s.

==Clinical use==
The following conditions are among those that can be detected through saliva testing (list not comprehensive): [[adrenal disorder|adrenal conditions]] (such as Cushing's disease/syndrome and [[Addison’s disease]]), altered female hormone states (such as [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] [PCOS], [[menopause]], [[anovulation]], and hormonal alterations in cycling women), altered male hormone states (such as hypogonadism/[[andropause]] and [[hyperestrogenemia|hyperestrogenic]] states), metabolic disturbances (such as [[insulin resistance]], [[diabetes]], and [[metabolic syndrome]]), benign and metastatic neoplasms (such as [[breast cancer]], [[pancreatic cancer]], and [[oral cancer]]), infectious conditions (such as HIV, [[viral hepatitis]], [[amoebiasis]], and [[helicobacter pylori]] infection), and allergic conditions (such as [[food allergy]]).

==Uses in behavioral research==
Saliva testing also has specific uses in clinical and [[Psychological research|experimental psychological]] settings. Due to its ability to provide insight into human behavior, emotions, and development, it has been used to investigate psychological phenomenon such as [[anxiety disorder|anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[PTSD]], and other behavioral disorders.<ref>{{cite web|title=Salimetrics Salivary Research|url=url=http://salimetricseurope.blogspot.com/2012/03/salimetrics-europe-publish-introduction.html}}</ref> Its primary purpose is to test [[cortisol]] and [[alpha amylase]] levels, which are indicative of stress levels. Salivary cortisol is a good stress index, with increased levels of cortisol correlating positively with increased levels of stress. Cortisol levels rise slowly over time and take a while to return to base level, indicating that cortisol is more associated with [[chronic stress]] levels.<ref name=Takai>{{cite journal|last=Takai|first=Noriyasu|coauthors=Yamaguchi, M., Aragaki, T., Eto, K., Uchihashi, K., and Nishikawa, Y.|title=Effect of psychological stress on the salivary cortisol and amylase levels in healthy young adults|journal=Archives of Oral Biology|year=2004|volume=49|pages=963–968|url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/21616229/2111234972/name/Effect+of+psychological+stress+on+the+salivary+cortisol+and+amylase+levels+in+healthy+young+adults.pdf}}</ref> Alpha amylase, on the other hand, spikes quickly when confronted with a stressor and returns to baseline soon after the stress has passed, making salivary amylase measurement a powerful tool for psychological research studying acute stress responses.<ref name=Takai/> Samples are usually collected from participants by having them drool through a straw into a collection tube while experiencing a stimulus, with samples taken every few minutes to record the gradual change in stress hormone levels. Because the collection of saliva samples is non-invasive, it has the advantage of not introducing further stress on the participant that may otherwise distort results.<ref name=Groschl>{{cite journal|last=Groschl|first=Michael|title=Current status of salivary hormone analysis|journal=Clinical Chemistry|year=2008|month=November|volume=54|issue=11|pages=1759–1769|url=http://www.clinchem.org/content/54/11/1759.full}}</ref>  
 
In more specific studies looking at the link between cortisol levels and psychological phenomena, it has been found that chronic stressors such as life-threatening situations (example: diseases), depression, and social or economic hardship correlate with significantly higher cortisol levels.<ref name=Groschl/> In situations where a subject undergoes induced anxiety, high cortisol levels correspond with experiencing more physiological symptoms of nervousness, such as increased heart rate, sweating, and [[Galvanic skin response|skin conductance]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Westenberg,|first=P. M.|coauthors=Bokhorst, C.L., Miers, A. C., Sumter, S.R., Kallen, V.L., van Pelt, J., and Blote, A. W.|title=A prepared speech in front of a pre-recorded audience: subjective, physiological, and neuroendocrine responses to the Leiden Public Speaking Task|journal=Biological Psychology|year=2009|month=October|volume=82|issue=2|pages=116–124}}</ref> Salivary cortisol levels can thus provide insight into a number of other psychological processes. 

Alpha amylase levels in saliva provide a non-invasive way to examine [[sympathoadrenal]] medullary (SAM) activity, which can otherwise be measured with [[electrophysiological]] equipment or [[blood plasma]] readings. Salivary alpha amylase levels have been found to correlate with heightened [[autonomic nervous system]] activity levels, reacting in similar ways to the hormone [[norepinephrine]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rohleder|first=Nicolas|coauthors=Nater, U. M., Wolf, J. M., Ehlert, U., and Kirschbaum, C.|title=Psychosocial stress-induced activation of salivary alpha amylase: an indicator of sympathetic activity?|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|year=2004|month=December|volume=1032|pages=258–263|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1196/annals.1314.033/full}}</ref> 

While saliva testing has the promise of becoming a valuable and more widely used tool in psychological research in the future, there are also some disadvantages to the method that must be kept in mind, including the cost of collecting and processing the samples and the reliability of the measure itself. There is a substantial amount of both within-person and between-person variability in cortisol levels that must be taken into account when drawing conclusions from studies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Nancy A.|title=Measurement of Cortisol. In: Handbook of Psychological Research Methods in Health Psychology|year=2008|publisher=Sage Publications|pages=37–74|url=http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/17430_Chapter_3.pdf|authorlink=Measurement of Cortisol|editor=L.J. Luecken and L.C. Gallo}}</ref>

Many studies have been performed to further examine the variables that contribute to these within-person and between-person variances. Analyses of the variables that affect cortisol levels has yielded an extensive list of confounding variables. 

[[Diurnal variation]] is a major factor for within-person variance because baseline cortisol levels have been known to differ based on the time of day. For normally developing individuals who follow a typical day–night schedule, cortisol production peaks during the last few hours of sleep. This peak is thought to aid in preparing the body for action and stimulate the appetite upon waking.<ref name="Klimes-Dougan">Klimes-Dougan, B., Hastings, P., Granger, D., Barbara, U., Zahn-Waxler, C., & , (2001). Adrenocortical activity in at-risk and normally developing adolescents: Individual differences in salivary cortisol basal levels, diunal variation, and responses to social challenges. Development and Psychopathology, 13, 695-719.</ref> Dirunal variation is also affected by psychological conditions. For example, Early morning cortisol levels have been found to be elevated in shy children and late night levels elevated in depressed adolescents, particularly the between the hours of two and four PM.<ref name="Klimes-Dougan"/> This might be important for understanding emotions and depressive symptoms.

Other variables that affect within- and between-person variation are listed below. The list is not meant to be comprehensive and the impact of many of these variables could benefit from further research and discussion. 

* Age is one of the major factors for between-person variance. Some studies indicate children and adolescents exhibit greater cortisol activity potentially related to development.<ref name=Kudielka>Kudielka, B., Hellhammer, D. H., & Wust, S. (2009, January). Why do we respond so differently? reviewing determinants of human salivary cortisol responses to challenge.</ref>

* Gender has been found to impact base line levels of cortisol, contributing to between-person variance. In generally stressful situations, levels of cortisol in males have been found to increase to nearly double the amount when compared to females.<ref name=Kudielka/> In stressful social situations (i.e. social rejection challenge), however, women but not men tend to show significantly higher levels of cortisol.<ref name=Kudielka/>

* The [[menstrual cycle]] has been found to impact levels of cortisol in the body, impacting both within- and between-person variance. Women in the [[luteal phase]] reportedly have levels of cortisol equal to men, suggesting no sex differences in base levels of cortical when women are not ovulating. Women in the [[follicular phase]] and women taking [[oral contraceptives]] reportedly have significantly lower levels of cortisol when compared to men and women in the luteal phase.<ref name=Kudielka/> 

* [[Pregnancy]] has been found to increase levels of cortisol in the body. In particular, [[breast-feeding]] has been found to decrease levels of cortisol in the short-term even if a mother is exposed to a psychosocial stressor.<ref name=Kudielka/>
 
* [[Nicotine]] is known to increase levels of cortisol in the body since it stimulates the [[HPA axis]]. After at least two cigarettes, smokers show significant elevations of salivary cortisol levels. Furthermore, habitual smokers show blunted salivary cortisol responses to psychological stressors.<ref name=Kudielka/>

* Food has been found to affect levels of cortisol. The presence of proteins has been found to increase cortisol.<ref name=Kudielka/> This variable is often affected by diurnal variation, with cortisol being notably higher during lunchtime than dinnertime, and gender, with women having higher levels of cortisol after eating than men.<ref name=Kudielka/> 

* While some studies examining the effects of alcohol consumption and caffeine intake on base levels of cortisol have found positive correlations, the results are mixed and would benefit from further examination.

* Intense or prolonged exercise can result in increased levels of cortisol. Short-term and low-level exercising only mildly increases levels of cortisol.<ref name=Kudielka/>

* Repeated exposure to initially stressful stimuli has been found to result in a leveling off of cortisol in the body.<ref name=Kudielka/> 

* Birth weight has been shown to be inversely related to base levels of cortisol; [[low birth weight]] is correlated with high levels of cortisol.<ref name=Kudielka/>

* Position within a [[social hierarchy]] has been found to affect levels of cortisol. One study in particular looked at a sample of 63 army recruits and found that socially dominant subjects showed high salivary cortisol increases compared to only modest elevations in subordinate men after stress exposure and physical exercise.<ref name=Kudielka/>

* Some medications (i.e. [[glucocorticoid]]s, [[psychoactive drug]]s, [[antidepressant]]s) have been found to affect levels of cortisol in the body but the results from studies examining these affects have been mixed.<ref name=Kudielka/> The impact of medications on cortical levels could benefit from further research.

====Female====
In 2010 a study identified [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) as an accurate salivary biomarker of [[ovulation]] in females.

==Selected criticism==
===Sensitivity and specificity===
[[File:Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin.png|thumb|left|A three-dimensional structure of the "sex hormone-binding globulin(SHBG)".]] 
One often cited criticism of using saliva as a diagnostic fluid is that biomarkers are present in amounts that are too low to be detected reliably. As Wong points out, however, this “is no longer a limitation” due to the development of increasingly sensitive detection techniques.<ref name=Wong/> Advances in ELISA and mass spectrometry, in addition to the emergence of novel detection methods that take advantage of nanotechnology and other technologies, are enabling scientists and practitioners to achieve high analyte sensitivity. 

Biomarker specificity is another consideration with saliva testing, much as it is with blood or urine testing. Many biomarkers are nonspecific (for example, CRP is a nonspecific inflammatory marker), and thus they can not be used alone to diagnose any particular disease. This issue is currently being addressed through identification of multiple biomarkers that are correlative of a disease; these can then be screened concomitantly to create a comprehensive panel of tests that significantly increases diagnostic specificity. Of note, certain types of saliva testing are considered by many to be more specific than blood testing; this is particularly true for steroid hormones. Since salivary hormone tests measure only those hormones that are not bound to [[sex hormone-binding globulin]] (SHBG) or [[albumin]], they are regarded as reflecting only the bioactive (“free”) fraction.<ref>Endocr J. 2009;56(3):521-3. Epub 2009 Feb 4. Salivary sex hormones during the menstrual cycle. Celec P, Ostaniková D, Skoknová M, Hodosy J, Putz Z, Kúdela M. Department of Molecular Biology, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia. PMID 19194049</ref><ref>Greenspan’s Basic & Clinical Endocrinology, 8th Ed. Saliva Testing directly measures active steroid hormone levels. 2007.</ref> With continued research into the field of salivary testing, accuracy parameters such as sensitivity and specificity will continue to improve.

===Standardization===
As with other diagnostic testing methods, one drawback of saliva testing is the variability that exists among diagnostic devices and laboratory analysis techniques, especially for measuring hormones.<ref>J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2010 Dec;95(12):5141-3. Standardization of hormonal assays for the 21st century. Wartofsky L, Handelsman DJ.</ref> Consequently, although a test result may be accurate and reliable within a particular assay method or laboratory, it may not be comparative to a test result obtained using a different method or laboratory. As the research community continues to validate and refine test methods and establish standard diagnostic ranges for various saliva biomarkers, this issue should be resolved. Recently, the U.S. National Institute of Health and Public Health Service each granted significant funding to further advancements in salivary testing, including the continued development of diagnostic standards.<ref name=Wong/><ref>Biomark Med. 2010 Feb;4(1):171-89.
