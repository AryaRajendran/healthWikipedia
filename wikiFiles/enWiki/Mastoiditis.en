'''Mastoiditis''' is the result of an [[infection]] that extends to the air cells of the [[human skull|skull]] behind the ear.  Specifically, it is an inflammation of the mucosal lining of the mastoid antrum and mastoid air cell system inside<ref>Diseases of ear nose & throat by PL dhingra & shruti dhingra. published by elsevier</ref> the [[mastoid process]], that portion of the [[temporal bone]] of the skull that is behind the [[ear]] and which contains open, [[mastoid cells|air-containing spaces]].<ref name="nih">{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001034.htm |title=Mastoiditis |accessdate=July 30, 2003 |publisher=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia}}</ref><ref name="earinfections">{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/ear-infection/ear-infections-treatment-overview |publisher=webmd.com |title= Ear Infections - Treatment |accessdate=24 November 2008}}</ref> It is usually caused by untreated acute [[otitis media]] (middle ear infection) and used to be a leading cause of child mortality.

==Features==
Some common [[symptoms]] and [[Medical sign|signs]] of mastoiditis include [[pain]], tenderness, and swelling in the mastoid region. There may be ear pain ([[otalgia]]), and the ear or mastoid region may be red (erythematous). Fever or headaches may also be present. Infants usually show [[nonspecific symptoms]], including [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[diarrhea]], or [[irritability]]. Drainage from the ear occurs in more serious cases, often manifest as brown discharge on the pillowcase upon waking.<ref name="emedicine" /><ref name="whattodo">{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/news/20010502/what-to-do-about-ear-infections |title= What to Do About Ear infections |publisher=webmd.com |accessdate=24 November 2008}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Mastoiditis1.jpg|thumb|right|Mastoiditis with subperiostal abscess]]
The diagnosis of mastoiditis is clinical&mdash;based on the [[medical history]] and [[physical examination]]. Imaging studies provide additional information; The standard method of diagnosis is via [[MRI scan]] although a [[CT scan]] is a common alternative as it gives a clearer and more useful image to see how close the damage may have gotten to the brain and facial nerves. Planar (2-D) [[X-rays]] are not as useful. If there is drainage, it is often sent for [[microbiological culture|culture]], although this will often be negative if the patient has begun taking antibiotics. Exploratory surgery is often used as a last resort method of diagnosis to see the mastoid and surrounding areas.<ref name="nih" /><ref name="Conserve">{{cite journal | title=Conservative management of acute mastoiditis in children | author=Bakhos D, Trijolet JP, Morinière S, Pondaven S, Al Zahrani M, Lescanne E | date=2011 Apr | journal=Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg | volume=137(4) | pages=346–50}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology of mastoiditis is straightforward: bacteria spread from the middle ear to the [[mastoid air cell]]s, where the inflammation causes damage to the bony structures. ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]], [[Streptococcus pyogenes]], [[Staphylococcus aureus]], [[Haemophilus influenzae]],'' and ''[[Moraxella catarrhalis]]'' are the most common organisms recovered in acute mastoiditis. Organisms that are rarely found are ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' and other Gram-negative aerobic bacilli, and anaerobic bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Acute mastoiditis in children: epidemiologic, clinical, microbiologic, and therapeutic aspects over past years | author=Nussinovitch M, Yoeli R, Elishkevitz K, Varsano I | year=2004 | journal=Clin Pediatr (Phila) | volume=43 | pages=261–7}}</ref> ''P. aeruginosa,'' Enterobacteriaceae,'' S. aureus'' and [[anaerobic infection|anaerobic bacteria]] ([[Prevotella]], [[Bacteroides]], [[Fusobacterium]], and ''Peptostreptococcus'' spp. ) are the most common isolates in chronic mastoiditis.<ref name="Anaerobe">{{cite journal | title=The role of anaerobic bacteria in acute and chronic mastoiditis | author=Brook I | year=2005 | journal=Anaerobe | volume=11 | pages=252–7}}</ref> Rarely, ''[[Mycobacterium]]'' species can also cause the infection. Some mastoiditis is caused by [[cholesteatoma]], which is a sac of keratinizing squamous epithelium in the middle ear that usually results from repeated middle-ear infections. If left untreated, the cholesteatoma can erode into the mastoid process, producing mastoiditis, as well as other complications.<ref name="emedicine" />

==Prevention and treatment==
In general, mastoiditis is rather simple to prevent. If the patient with an ear infection seeks treatment promptly and receives complete treatment, the antibiotics will usually cure the infection and prevent its spread. For this reason, mastoiditis is rare in developed countries. However, the rise of "superbugs" that are resistant to conventional antibiotics increases the risk that ear infections will worsen into mastoiditis.  Most ear infections occur in infants as the eustachian tubes are not fully developed and don't drain readily.

In the United States the primary treatment for mastoiditis is administration of [[intravenous]] antibiotics. Initially, broad-spectrum antibiotics are given, such as [[ceftriaxone]]. As culture results become available, treatment can be switched to more specific antibiotics directed at the eradication of the recovered aerobic and [[anaerobic infection|anaerobic bacteria]].<ref name="Anaerobe" /> Long-term antibiotics may be necessary to completely eradicate the infection.<ref name="emedicine" /> If the condition does not quickly improve with antibiotics, surgical procedures may be performed (while continuing the medication). The most common procedure is a [[myringotomy]], a small incision in the [[tympanic membrane]] (eardrum), or the insertion of a [[tympanostomy tube]] into the eardrum.<ref name="Conserve" /> These serve to drain the pus from the middle ear, helping to treat the infection. The tube is extruded spontaneously after a few weeks to months, and the incision heals naturally. If there are complications, or the mastoiditis does not respond to the above treatments, it may be necessary to perform a mastoidectomy: a procedure in which a portion of the bone is removed and the infection drained.<ref name="emedicine" />

==Prognosis==
With prompt treatment, it is possible to cure mastoiditis. Seeking medical care early is important. However, it is difficult for antibiotics to penetrate to the interior of the mastoid process and so it may not be easy to cure the infection; it also may recur. Mastoiditis has many possible complications, all connected to the infection spreading to surrounding structures. [[Hearing loss]] is likely, or inflammation of the [[labyrinth (inner ear)|labyrinth]] of the [[inner ear]] ([[labyrinthitis]]) may occur, producing [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] and an ear ringing may develop along with the hearing loss, making it more difficult to communicate. The infection may also spread to the [[facial nerve]] (cranial nerve VII), causing [[facial-nerve palsy]], producing weakness or paralysis of some muscles of facial expression, on the same side of the face. Other complications include [[Bezold's abscess]], an abscess (a collection of pus surrounded by inflamed tissue) behind the [[sternocleidomastoid muscle]] in the neck, or a [[subperiosteal abscess]], between the periosteum and mastoid bone ( resulting in the typical appearance of a protruding ear). Serious complications result if the infection spreads to the brain. These include [[meningitis]] (inflammation of the protective membranes surrounding the brain), [[epidural abscess]] (abscess between the skull and outer membrane of the brain), dural venous [[thrombophlebitis]] (inflammation of the [[vein|venous]] structures of the brain), or [[brain abscess]].<ref name="nih" /><ref name="emedicine" />

==Epidemiology==
In the [[United States]] and other developed countries, the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of mastoiditis is quite low, around 0.004%, although it is higher in developing countries.  The most common ages affected are 2 months - 13 months, as it is during that age that ear infections are most common. Males and females are equally affected.<ref name="earinfections" />
