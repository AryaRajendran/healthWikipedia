In [[human anatomy]], the '''wrist''' is variously defined as 1) the [[carpus]] or carpal bones, the complex of eight bones forming the proximal skeletal segment of the hand;<ref name="Behnke-76">Behnke 2006, p. 76. "The wrist contains eight bones, roughly aligned in two rows, known as the carpal bones."</ref><ref name="Moore-485">Moore 2006, p. 485. "The wrist (carpus), the proximal segment of the hand, is a complex of eight carpal bones.  The carpus articulates proximally with the forearm at the wrist joint and distally with the five metacarpals.  The joints formed by the carpus include the wrist (radiocarpal joint), intercarpal, carpometacarpal and intermetacarpal joints.  Augmenting movement at the wrist joint, the rows of carpals glide on each other&nbsp;[...] "</ref>
(2) the '''wrist joint''' or '''radiocarpal joint''', the joint between the [[radius (bone)|radius]] and the carpus;<ref name="Moore-485" /> and
(3) the anatomical region surrounding the carpus including the distal parts of the bones of the forearm and the proximal parts of the [[metacarpus]] or five metacarpal bones and the series of joints between these bones, thus referred to as ''wrist joints''.<ref name="Behnke-77">Behnke 2006, p. 77. "With the large number of bones composing the wrist (ulna, radius, eight carpas, and five metacarpals), it makes sense that there are many, many joints that make up the structure known as the wrist."</ref><ref name="Baratz-391">Baratz 1999, p. 391. "The wrist joint is composed of not only the radiocarpal and distal radioulnar joints but also the intercarpal articulations."</ref>  This region also includes the [[carpal tunnel]], the [[anatomical snuff box]], the [[Flexor retinaculum of the hand|flexor retinaculum]], and the [[extensor retinaculum of the hand|extensor retinaculum]].

As a consequence of these various definitions, fractures to the carpal bones are referred to as carpal fractures, while fractures such as [[distal radius fracture]] are considered fractures to the wrist.

== Etymology ==
The [[English language|English]] word "[[wikt:wrist|wrist]]" is [[Etymology|etymologically]] derived from the ancient [[German language|German]] word ''wristiz'' from which are derived modern German ''[[:de:rist|rist]]'' ("[[wikt:instep|instep]]", "wrist") and modern [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''[[wikt:vrist|vrist]]'' ("instep", "[[wikt:ankle|ankle]]").  The base ''writh-'' and its variants are associated with [[Old English]] words "[[wikt:wreath|wreath]]", "[[wikt:wrest|wrest]]", and "[[wikt:writhe|writhe]]".  The ''wr-'' sound of this base seems originally to have been symbolic of the action of twisting.

=== Articulations ===
The radiocarpal, intercarpal, midcarpal, carpometacarpal, and intermetacarpal joints often intercommunicate through a common synovial cavity.

==== Extrinsic hand ====
The [[distal radioulnar articulation|distal radioulnar joint]] is a pivot joint located between the bones of the [[forearm]], the [[Radius (bone)|radius]] and [[ulna]].  Formed by the [[head of ulna]] and the [[Ulnar notch of the radius|ulnar notch of radius]], this joint is separated from the radiocarpal joint by an articular disk lying between the radius and the [[ulnar styloid process|styloid process of ulna]].  The capsule of the joint is lax and extends from the [[Sacciform recess of distal radioulnar joint|inferior sacciform recess]] to the ulnar shaft.  Together with the [[proximal radioulnar joint]], the distal radioulnar joint permits [[pronation]] and [[supination]].
<ref name="Platzer-122">Platzer 2004, p. 122</ref>

The radiocarpal joint or wrist joint is an ellipsoid joint formed by the radius and the [[articular disc]] proximally and the proximal row of carpal bones distally.  The carpal bones on the ulnar side only make intermittent contact with the proximal side &mdash; the triquetrum only makes contact during ulnar abduction.  The capsule, lax and un-branched, is thin on the dorsal side and can contain synovial folds.  The capsule is continuous with the midcarpal joint and strengthened by numerous [[ligament]]s, including the [[palmar radiocarpal ligament|palmar]] and [[dorsal radiocarpal ligament]]s, and the [[ulnar collateral ligament (wrist)|ulnar]] and [[Radial collateral ligament (wrist)|radial collateral ligaments]].
<ref name="Platzer-130">Platzer 2004, p. 130</ref>

The parts forming the radiocarpal joint are the lower end of the [[radius (bone)|radius]] and under surface of the [[articular disk]] above; and the [[scaphoid]], [[Lunate bone|lunate]], and [[triquetral]] bones below. The articular surface of the radius and the under surface of the [[articular disk]] form together a transversely elliptical concave surface, the receiving cavity.  The superior articular surfaces of the scaphoid, lunate, and triquetrum form a smooth convex surface, the [[Condyle (anatomy)|condyle]], which is received into the concavity.

==== Intrinsic hand ====
[[Image:Carpus.svg|thumb|[[Carpal bones]] of the right [[hand]] <BR>''Proximal:'' A=[[Scaphoid bone|Scaphoid]], B=[[Lunate bone|Lunate]], C=[[Triquetrum bone|Triquetrum]], D=[[Pisiform bone|Pisiform]]<BR>''Distal:'' E=[[Trapezium bone|Trapezium]], F=[[Trapezoid bone|Trapezoid]], G=[[Capitate bone|Capitate]], H=[[Hamate bone|Hamate]]]]
In the hand proper a total of 13 bones form part of the wrist: eight [[carpus|carpal bones]]&mdash;[[scaphoid]], [[lunate bone|lunate]], [[triquetral]], [[pisiform]], [[trapezium (bone)|trapezium]], [[trapezoid bone|trapezoid]], [[capitate]], and [[hamate]]&mdash; and five [[Metacarpus|metacarpal bones]]&mdash;the [[First metacarpal bone|first]], [[Second metacarpal bone|second]], [[Third metacarpal bone|third]], [[fourth metacarpal bone|fourth]], and [[fifth metacarpal bone]]s.<ref name="Platzer-126-129">Platzer 2004, pp. 126â€“129</ref>

The [[midcarpal joint]] is the S-shaped joint space separating the proximal and distal rows of carpal bones.  The [[Intercarpal articulations|intercarpal joints]], between the bones of each row, are strengthened by the [[radiate carpal ligament|radiate carpal]] and [[pisohamate ligament]]s and the [[Palmar intercarpal ligaments|palmar]], [[Interosseous intercarpal ligaments|interosseous]], and [[dorsal intercarpal ligament]]s.  Some degree of mobility is possible between the bones of the proximal row while the bones of the distal row are connected to each other and to the metacarpal bones &mdash;at the [[carpometacarpal joint]]s&mdash; by strong ligaments &mdash;the [[pisometacarpal ligament|pisometacarpal]] and [[Palmar carpometacarpal ligament|palmar]] and [[dorsal carpometacarpal ligament]]&mdash; that makes a functional entity of these bones.  Additionally, the joints between the bases of the metacarpal bones &mdash;the [[intermetacarpal articulations]]&mdash; are strengthened by [[Dorsal intermetacarpal ligament|dorsal]], [[Interosseous intermetacarpal ligament|interosseous]], and [[palmar intermetacarpal ligament]]s.

=== Movements and muscles ===
The extrinsic hand muscles are located in the forearm where their bellies form the proximal fleshy roundness.  When contracted, most of the tendons of these muscles are prevented from standing up like taut bowstrings around the wrist by passing under the [[flexor retinaculum of the hand|flexor retinaculum]] on the palmar side and the [[extensor retinaculum of the hand|extensor retinaculum]] on the dorsal side.  On the palmar side the carpal bones form the [[carpal tunnel]] through which some of the flexor tendons pass in [[tendon sheath]]s that enable them to slide back and forth through the narrow passageway (see [[carpal tunnel syndrome]]).
<ref name="Saladin-361">Saladin, 2003, pp. 361, 365</ref>

Starting from the mid-position of the hand, the [[Anatomical terms of location#Relative motions|movements]] permitted in the wrist proper are (muscles in order of importance):<ref name="Platzer-132">Platzer 2004, p. 132</ref><ref name="Platzer-172">Platzer 2004, p. 172</ref>
* Marginal movements: radial deviation (abduction, movement towards the thumb) and ulnar deviation (adduction, movement towards the little finger).  These movements take place about a dorsopalmar axis (back to front) at the radiocarpal and midcarpal joints  passing through the capitate bone.
** Radial abduction: [[Extensor carpi radialis longus muscle|extensor carpi radialis longus]], [[Abductor pollicis longus muscle|abductor pollicis longus]], [[Extensor pollicis longus muscle|extensor pollicis longus]], [[Flexor carpi radialis muscle|flexor carpi radialis]], [[Flexor pollicis longus muscle|flexor pollicis longus]]
** Ulnar adduction: [[Extensor carpi ulnaris muscle|extensor carpi ulnaris]], [[Flexor carpi ulnaris muscle|flexor carpi ulnaris]], [[Extensor digitorum muscle|extensor digitorum]], [[Extensor digiti minimi muscle|extensor digiti minimi]]
* Movements in the plane of the hand: flexion (palmar flexion, tilting towards the palm) and extension (dorsiflexion, tilting towards the back of the hand).  These movements take place through a transverse axis  passing through the capitate bone.  Palmar flexion is the most powerful of these movements because the flexors, especially the finger flexors, are considerably stronger than the extensors.
** Extension: [[Extensor digitorum muscle|extensor digitorum]], [[Extensor carpi radialis longus muscle|extensor carpi radialis longus]], [[Extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle|extensor carpi radialis brevis]], [[Extensor indicis muscle|extensor indicis]], [[Extensor pollicis longus muscle|extensor pollicis longus]], [[Extensor digiti minimi muscle|extensor digiti minimi]], [[extensor carpi ulnaris]]
** Palmar flexion: [[Flexor digitorum superficialis muscle|flexor digitorum superficialis]], [[Flexor digitorum profundus muscle|flexor digitorum profundus]], [[Flexor carpi ulnaris muscle|flexor carpi ulnaris]], [[Flexor pollicis longus muscle|flexor pollicis longus]], [[Flexor carpi radialis muscle|flexor carpi radialis]], [[Abductor pollicis longus muscle|abductor pollicis longus]]
* Intermediate or combined movements

However, movements at the wrist can not be properly described without including movements in the distal radioulnar joint in which the rotary actions of [[supination]] and [[pronation]] occur and this joint is therefore normally regarded as part of the wrist.
