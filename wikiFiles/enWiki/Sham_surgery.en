'''Sham surgery''' (also called '''placebo surgery''') is a faked [[surgery|surgical intervention]] that omits the step thought to be therapeutically necessary.<ref name="wisegeek">{{cite web| url= http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-sham-surgery.htm|title=What is sham surgery?|publisher=wiseGeek.|accessdate=2012-23-05}}</ref>

In [[clinical trials]] of surgical interventions, sham surgery is an important [[scientific control]]. This is because it isolates the specific effects of the treatment as opposed to the incidental effects caused by [[anesthesia]], the [[incision]]al trauma, pre- and postoperative care, and the patient's perception of having had a regular operation.<ref name="wisegeek"/> Thus sham surgery serves an analogous purpose to [[placebo]] drugs, neutralizing biases such as the [[placebo effect]].

==Human research==
The [[placebo-controlled trial]] is the gold standard of [[medical research]].<ref name=nejm>{{cite journal  | author=Macklin R  | title=The Ethical Problems with Sham Surgery in Clinical Research |  journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] | date=September 23, 1999|pmid=10498498  | volume=341  | issue=13  | pages=992–6  | doi=10.1056/NEJM199909233411312}}</ref>  Therefore, when testing results of a surgical procedure, sham surgery serves as the intervention in the control population. However, the use of sham surgery in human research is controversial<ref name=nyt>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/review/042599surgery-ethics-review.html |author=Stolberg SG|publisher=The [[New York Times]] |title=Sham Surgey Returns as a Research Tool| date=April 25, 1999 |accessdate=May 1, 2009}}</ref> as it places ethical and research standards into conflict.<ref name=nejm/> While sham surgery has the potential to harm the subject, research designs without sham surgery are scientifically less rigorous. Proponents argue that surgical interventions need to be tested as critically as medical interventions.<ref name=nejm/> One partial solution is that when a clinical trial is over, those people who received sham surgery may be offered a second surgery including the actual treatment. Because of the ethical concerns, sham-controlled studies are rarely performed in humans.<ref name=albin>{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/jme.28.5.322|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-26410280_ITM | author=Albin RL | title=Sham surgery controls: intracerebral grafting of fetal tissue for parkinson's disease and proposed criteria for use of sham surgery controls.|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics | date=October 1, 2002 |pmid=12356962| volume=28| issue=5| pages=322–5| pmc=1733639}}</ref> 

A number of studies done under [[Institutional review board|IRB]]-approved settings have delivered important and surprising results. With the progress in [[minimally invasive surgery]], sham procedures can be more easily performed as the sham incision can be kept small similarly to the incision in the studied procedure. 

===Examples===
In a number of situations, sham-controlled interventions have identified interventions that are useless but had been believed by the medical community to be helpful based on studies without the use of sham surgery. Thus in 1939 Fieschi introduced [[internal mammary artery|internal mammary]] ligation as a procedure to improve blood flow to the heart. Not until a controlled study was done two decades later could it be demonstrated that the procedure was only as effective as the sham surgery.<ref name=nyt/><ref name="Cobb">{{cite journal| author=Cobb LA, Thomas GI, Dillard DH, Merendino KA, Bruce RA. |title=An evaluation of internal-mammary-artery ligation by a double-blind technic.| journal=New England Journal of Medicine |pmid=13657350| year=1959| volume=260| issue=22| pages=1115–8| doi=10.1056/NEJM195905282602204}}</ref> In neurosurgery, cell-transplant surgical interventions were offered in many centers in the world for patients with [[Parkinson disease]] until sham-controlled experiments involving the drilling of [[Burr (cutter)|burr]] holes into the [[Human skull|skull]] demonstrated such interventions ineffective and possibly harmful.<ref name=an>{{cite journal |author=Kim SYH, Frank S, Holloway R, Zimmerman C, Wilson R, Kieburtz K |title=Science and Ethics of Sham Surgery.

In March 2013 a [http://medicine.buffalo.edu/news_and_events/news.host.html/content/shared/smbs/news/2013/03/ccsvi-ms-2482.detail.html sham surgical study] of a popular but biologically inexplicable venous balloon angioplasty procedure for multiple sclerosis showed the surgery was no better than placebo.

In a classic experiment in orthopedic surgery, Moseley and coworkers studied the effect of [[arthroscopic surgery]] for [[osteoarthritis]] of the knee establishing two treatment groups and a sham-operated control group.<ref name=moseley>{{cite journal |author=Moseley JB, O'Malley K, Petersen NJ, Menke TJ, Brody BA, Kuykendall DH, Hollingsworth JC, Ashton CM, Wray NP| title=A controlled trial of arthroscopic surgery for osteoarthritis of the knee |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] |date=2002 |pmid=12110735 |volume=347 |issue=2 |pages=81–8 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa013259}}</ref> They found that patients in the treatment arms did no better than those in the control group. The fact that all three groups improved equally points to the placebo effect in surgical interventions.

===Ethical considerations===
While some ethicists reject sham-surgery in controlled trials,<ref name=nejm/><ref>{{cite journal | journal=J Med Ethics. |  title=Sham neurosurgery in patients with Parkinson's disease: is it morally acceptable?   |author=Dekkers W, Boer G. | pmid=11417020 | year=2001 | volume=27 | issue=3 | pages=151–6 | pmc=1733414}}</ref> others maintain that such trials are ethically acceptable but should conform to certain restrictions.<ref name=albin/><ref name=ama/><ref>{{cite journal | url=http://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/Abstract/2002/02000/Surgical__Placebo__Controls.21.aspx

==Animal research==
Sham surgery has been widely used in surgical animal models. Historically, studies in animals also allowed the removal or alteration of an organ; using sham-operated animals as control, deductions could be made about the function of the organ. Sham interventions can also be performed as controls when new surgical procedures are developed.
