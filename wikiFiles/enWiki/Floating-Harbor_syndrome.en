'''Floating-Harbor syndrome''', also known as '''Pelletier-Leisti syndrome''', is a rare disease with less that 50 cases described in the literature.<ref name=White2010>{{cite journal |last=White |first=S. M. |last2=Morgan |first2=A. |last3=Da Costa |first3=A. |last4=Lacombe |first4=D. |last5=Knight |first5=S. J. |last6=Houlston |first6=R. |last7=Whiteford |first7=M. L. |last8=Newbury-Ecob |first8=R.

Although its cause is presently unknown it is thought to be due to a genetic mutation.

==History==

The disease was first described in 1973 by at the [[Boston Floating Hospital]],<ref name=Pelletier1973>Pelletier G, Feingold, M (1973) Case report 1. Syndrome Ident. 1: 8-9</ref> and in 1975 at Harbor General Hospital in [[Torrance, California|Torrance]], [[California]].<ref name=Leisti1975>{{cite journal |last=Leisti |first=J. |last2=Hollister |first2=D. W. |last3=Rimoin |first3=D. L. |year=1975 |title=The Floating-Harbor syndrome |journal=Birth Defects Orig Artic Ser. |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=305 |pmid=1218224 }}</ref> The name Floating-Harbor syndrome was coined by Robinson ''et al.'' in 1988.<ref name=Robinson1988>{{cite journal |last=Robinson |first=P. |last2=''et al.'' |year=1988 |title=A unique association of short stature, dysmorphic features, and speech impairment (Floating–Harbor syndrome) |journal=[[The Journal of Pediatrics|J Ped]] |volume=113 |issue=4 |pages=703–706 |doi= |pmid=3171794 }}</ref>

==Clinical features==

All cases of this syndrome have the triad of short stature, expressive language delay and a triangular face with a prominent nose and deep set eyes.

The short stature is often apparent at birth and is associated with significantly delayed bone age. Stature may be as much as 4-6 [[standard deviation]]s below the mean height for age. Expressive language delay occurs despite normal motor development. The facies are triangular with a prominent nose and deep set eyes. Other features that may be present include posteriorly rotated ears, long eyelashes, a bulbous nose, a wide [[Nasal septum|columella]], a short [[philtrum]], thin lips, a broad downturned mouth, a short neck and a low posterior hairline.

There is a strong association with [[celiac disease]]. Joint laxity, curved fifth fingers ([[clinodactyly]]) and [[hirsutism]] may also be found. Dental anomalies ([[malocclusion]], supernumerary upper teeth) occur. '''Intellectual functioning may range from borderline low to well below average intellectual ''disability'''''. Early puberty may occur. Heart defects may be present: the most commonly recognised involves a narrowing of the [[pulmonary artery]] ([[pulmonary stenosis]]). The [[urethra]] may open on the underside of the [[penis]] ([[hypospadias]]).

==Differential diagnosis==

The clinical diagnosis of Floating–Harbor syndrome may be unreliable or overlap with other dysmorphic syndromes. Differential diagnoses include [[velocardiofacial syndrome]] (Shprintzen syndrome),<ref name=Lipson1991>Lipson A (1991) Floating Harbor and the good ship Shprintzen. J Med Genet 28:807–808</ref> [[trichorhinophalangeal syndrome]], [[De Lange syndrome]], [[Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome]] and [[monosomy 22q11]].

==Aetiology==

The cause of this condition is unknown but a genetic cause is suspected. Two possibly familial cases have been reported—one in a mother and son<ref name=Penaloza2003>Penaloza J et al (2003) A variant example of familial Floating–Harbor syndrome? Genetic counselling 4(1):31–37</ref> and the other in a mother and daughter.<ref name=Fryns1996>Fryns JP et al (1996) The Floating–Harbor syndrome: two affected siblings in a family. Clinical genetics 50:217–219</ref><ref name=Rosen1998>Rosen AC et al (1998) A further report on a case of Floating–Harbor Syndrome in a mother and daughter. J Clin and Exp Neuropsychology 20:483–495</ref> This suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance but additional cases need to be investigated to establish this.

Another report has suggested that the inheritance may be autosomal recessive.<ref name=Ioan2003>Ioan DM, Fryns JP (2003) Floating-Harbor syndrome in two sisters: autosomal recessive inheritance or germinal mosaicism? Genet. Counsel. 14: 431-433</ref>
