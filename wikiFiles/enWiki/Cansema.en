'''Cansema''' (also known as '''black salve''') is a brand name of a popular [[alternative cancer treatment]]. The product is commonly classified as an [[escharotic]]—that is, a topical paste which burns and destroys skin tissue and leaves behind a thick, black scar called an [[eschar]].<ref name="review">{{cite journal |author=Jellinek N, Maloney ME |title=Escharotic and other botanical agents for the treatment of skin cancer: a review |journal=J.

==Usages and dangers==
Cancer salves were first documented as a form of [[quackery]] in a 1955 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' article:
{{blockquote|A 37-year-old housewife had a skin condition that later (at Duke) proved not to be a cancer. Convinced that it was, she had gone to a backwoods healer, who applied a salve. Soon a quarter-sized hole disfigured her nose, opened up the nasal cavity. Duke's plastic surgeons had to build her a new nose.<ref name="Time Cancer Quacks">{{Cite web | title = Medicine: Cancer Quacks | work = Time Magazine | publisher = Time Inc. | date = February 28, 1955 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,861227,00.html | accessdate = December 21, 2009}}</ref>}}
More recent reports document the ongoing marketing of escharotics via the Internet as purported "cures" for skin cancer.<ref name="consequences">{{cite journal |author=McDaniel S, Goldman GD |title=Consequences of using escharotic agents as primary treatment for nonmelanoma skin cancer |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=138 |issue=12 |pages=1593–6 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12472348 |doi= 10.1001/archderm.138.12.1593|url=}}</ref>

Cansema and other escharotics are not recommended as treatments for skin lesions or skin cancer. The effectiveness of escharotics is unproven, and much safer and more effective alternatives exist, such as [[Mohs surgery]]. Escharotics can cause serious scarring and damage to normal skin. Their manufacture is largely unregulated, so the strength and purity of marketed products are unknown and unverified.<ref name="dermnet"/> Numerous reports in the medical literature describe serious consequences of using escharotics in place of standard treatments for skin cancer, ranging from disfigurement to preventable cancer recurrences.<ref name="review"/><ref name="consequences"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Affleck AG, Varma S |title=A case of do-it-yourself Mohs' surgery using bloodroot obtained from the internet |journal=Br.

The website [[Quackwatch]] posted a warning against the use of escharotics in 2008. The site collected a variety of sourced documents compiling issues of patient injury from the use of escharotics.<ref name="Barrett Quackwatch">{{Cite web

The extract of [[bloodroot]] is called [[sanguinarine]], an ammonium salt which attacks and destroys living tissue and is also classified as an [[escharotic]].
