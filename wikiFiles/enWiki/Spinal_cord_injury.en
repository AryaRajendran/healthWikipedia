A '''spinal cord injury''' ('''SCI''') refers to any injury to the [[spinal cord]] that is caused by [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] instead of disease.<ref name="tabers">{{cite book |author=Taber, Clarence Wilbur; Venes, Donald |title=Taber's cyclopedic medical dictionary |publisher=F.A.

Treatment of spinal cord injuries starts with restraining the spine and controlling [[myelopathy|inflammation]] to prevent further damage.  The actual treatment can vary widely depending on the location and extent of the injury.  In many cases, spinal cord injuries require substantial physical therapy and rehabilitation, especially if the patient's injury interferes with activities of daily life.

Spinal cord injuries have many causes, but are typically associated with major trauma from [[motor vehicle accident]]s, [[Falling (accident)|falls]], [[sports injuries]], and [[violence]]. Research into treatments for spinal cord injuries includes controlled [[hypothermia]] and [[stem cells]], though many treatments have not been studied thoroughly and very little new research has been implemented in standard care.

==Classification==
[[File:Nervous system diagram.png|thumb|The spinal cord (highlighted in dark red) runs from the base of the brain down through the spine in a person's back.  It connects the [[brain]] to the nerves throughout the body.]]

The [[American Spinal Injury Association]] (ASIA) first published an international classification of spinal cord injury in 1982, called the ''International Standards for Neurological and Functional Classification of Spinal Cord Injury''. Now in its sixth edition, the ''International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury'' (ISNCSCI) is still widely used to document sensory and motor impairments following SCI.<ref name=Marino>{{cite journal |author1=Marino RJ |author2=Barros T |author3=''et al.''; (ASIA Neurological Standards Committee 2002) |title=International standards for neurological classification of spinal cord injury |journal=J Spinal Cord Med. |year=2003 |volume=26 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S50–6 |pmid=16296564 |last4=Burns |first4=SP |last5=Donovan |first5=WH |last6=Graves |first6=DE |last7=Haak |first7=M |last8=Hudson |first8=LM |last9=Priebe |first9=MM}}</ref> It is based on neurological responses, touch and pinprick sensations tested in each [[dermatome (anatomy)|dermatome]], and  strength of ten key muscles on each side of the body, including hip flexion ([[lumbar spinal nerve 2|L2]]), shoulder shrug ([[cervical spinal nerve 4|C4]]), elbow flexion ([[cervical spinal nerve 5|C5]]), wrist extension ([[cervical spinal nerve 6|C6]]), and elbow extension ([[cervical spinal nerve 7|C7]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Standard Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury |url=http://www.asia-spinalinjury.org/publications/59544_sc_Exam_Sheet_r4.pdf |publisher=[[American Spinal Injury Association]]  & ISCOS |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref> Traumatic spinal cord injury is classified into five categories on the ASIA Impairment Scale:
*  A indicates a "complete" spinal cord injury where no motor or sensory function is preserved in the sacral segments S4-S5.
*  B indicates an "incomplete" spinal cord injury where sensory but not motor function is preserved below the neurological level and includes the sacral segments S4-S5.  This is typically a transient phase and if the person recovers any motor function below the neurological level, that person essentially becomes a motor incomplete, i.e. ASIA C or D.
*  C indicates an "incomplete" spinal cord injury where motor function is preserved below the neurological level and more than half of key muscles below the neurological level have a muscle grade of less than 3, which indicates active movement with full range of motion against gravity.
*  D indicates an "incomplete" spinal cord injury where motor function is preserved below the neurological level and at least half of the key muscles below the neurological level have a muscle grade of 3 or more.
*  E indicates "normal" where motor and sensory scores are normal.  Note that it is possible to have spinal cord injury and neurological deficits with completely normal motor and sensory scores.<ref name=Marino/>

==Signs and symptoms==
{{vertebral column}}

Signs recorded by a physician and symptoms experienced by a patient will vary depending on where the spine is injured and the extent of the injury.  These are all determined by the area of the body that the injured area of the spine innervates.  A section of skin [[nerve|innervated]] through a specific part of the spine is called a [[dermatome (anatomy)|dermatome]], and spinal injury can cause pain, numbness, or a loss of sensation in the relevant areas.  A group of muscles innervated through a specific part of the spine is called a [[myotome]], and injury to the spine can cause problems with voluntary motor control.  The muscles may [[spasticity|contract uncontrollably]], become [[paresis|weak]], or be completely [[paralysis|unresponsive]].  The loss of muscle function can have additional effects if the muscle is not used, including [[atrophy]] of the muscle and bone degeneration.

A severe injury may also cause problems in parts of the spine below the injured area.  In a "complete" spinal injury, all function below the injured area are lost.  In an "incomplete" injury, some or all of the functions below the injured area may be unaffected.  If the patient has the ability to contract the [[Bulbocavernosus Reflex|anal sphincter voluntarily]] or to feel a pinprick or touch around the anus, the injury is considered to be incomplete.  The nerves in this area are connected to the very lowest region of the spine, the sacral region, and retaining sensation and function in these parts of the body indicates that the spinal cord is only partially damaged. An incomplete spinal cord injury involves preservation of motor or sensory function below the level of injury in the spinal cord.<ref name="SCI Medicine">{{cite journal | author=Ho C.H., Wuermser L.A., Priebe M.M., Chiodo A.E., Scelza W.M., Kirshblum S.C. | year=2007 | title=Spinal cord injury medicine. 1.

A complete injury frequently means that the patient has little hope of functional recovery.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}  The relative incidence of incomplete injuries compared to complete spinal cord injury has improved over the past half century, due mainly to the emphasis on better initial care and stabilization of spinal cord injury patients.<ref name="spine">{{cite journal |last1=Sekhon |first1= LH |last2=Fehlings |first2=MH |year=2001 |title=Epidemiology, demographics, and pathophysiology of acute spinal cord injury |journal= Spine |volume=26 |issue= 24 Suppl|pages=S2–12 |pmid=11805601 |doi=10.1097/00007632-200112151-00002 }}</ref>  Most patients with incomplete injuries recover at least some function.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In addition to sensation and muscle control, the loss of connection between the brain and the rest of the body can have specific effects depending on the location of the injury.

Determining the exact "level" of injury is critical in making accurate predictions about the specific parts of the body that may be affected by paralysis and loss of function.  The level is assigned according to the location of the injury by the [[vertebra]] of the spinal column.  While the prognosis of complete injuries are generally predictable since recovery is rare, the symptoms of incomplete injuries can vary and it is difficult to make an accurate prediction of the outcome.

=== Cervical ===
Cervical (neck) injuries usually result in full or partial [[tetraplegia]] ([[Quadriplegia]]). However, depending on the specific location and severity of trauma, limited function may be retained.

*  Injuries at the C-1/C-2 levels will often result in loss of breathing, necessitating mechanical [[ventilator]]s or [[phrenic nerve pacing]].
* C3 [[vertebrae]] and above : Typically results in loss of [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] function, necessitating the use of a ventilator for breathing.
* C4 : Results in significant loss of function at the biceps and shoulders.'''
* C5 : Results in potential loss of function at the biceps and shoulders, and complete loss of function at the wrists and hands.'''
* C6 : Results in limited wrist control, and complete loss of hand function.
* C7 and T1 : Results in lack of dexterity in the hands and fingers, but allows for limited use of arms.

Patients with complete injuries above C7 typically cannot handle [[activities of daily living]] and cannot function independently.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Additional signs and symptoms of cervical injuries include:

*  Inability or reduced ability to regulate  [[heart rate]], [[blood pressure]], [[sweating]] and hence [[body temperature]].
*  [[Autonomic dysreflexia]] or abnormal increases in blood pressure, sweating, and other autonomic responses to pain or sensory disturbances.

=== Thoracic ===
Complete injuries at or below the thoracic spinal levels result in [[paraplegia]]. Functions of the hands, arms, neck, and breathing are usually not affected.

* T1 to T8 : Results in the inability to control the abdominal muscles. Accordingly, trunk stability is affected. The lower the level of injury, the less severe the effects.
* T9 to T12 : Results in partial loss of trunk and abdominal muscle control.

Typically lesions above the T6 spinal cord level can result in Autonomic Dysreflexia.<ref>{{cite book

=== Lumbosacral ===
The effects of injuries to the [[lumbar]] or [[sacrum|sacral]] regions of the spinal cord are decreased control of the [[human leg|leg]]s and [[hip]]s, urinary system, and anus.

*  [[intestine|Bowel]] and [[urinary bladder|bladder]] function is regulated by the [[sacrum|sacral]] region of the [[vertebral column|spine]]. In that regard, it is very common to experience dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including infections of the bladder and anal incontinence, after traumatic injury.
*  [[Sexual function]] is also associated with the sacral spinal segments, and is often affected after injury. During a [[psychogenic]] sexual experience, signals from the brain are sent to the sacral parasympathetic cell bodies at spinal levels S2-S4 and in case of men, are then relayed to the penis where they trigger an erection. A spinal cord lesion of descending fibers to levels S2-S4 could, therefore, potentially result in the loss of psychogenic erection. A reflexogenic erection, on the other hand, occurs as a result of direct physical contact to the penis or other erotic areas such as the ears, nipples or neck, and thus not involving descending fibers from the brain. A reflex erection is involuntary and can occur without sexually stimulating thoughts. The nerves that control a man's ability to have a reflex erection are located in the sacral nerves (S2-S4) of the spinal cord and could be affected after a spinal cord injury at this level.<ref>{{cite web

=== Other syndromes of incomplete injury ===

[[Central cord syndrome]] is a form of incomplete spinal cord injury characterized by impairment in the arms and hands and, to a lesser extent, in the legs.  This is also referred to as inverse paraplegia, because the hands and arms are paralyzed while the legs and lower extremities work correctly.

Most often the damage is to the cervical or upper thoracic regions of the spinal cord, and characterized by weakness in the arms with relative sparing of the legs with variable sensory loss.

This condition is associated with ischemia, hemorrhage, or necrosis involving the central portions of the spinal cord (the large nerve fibers that carry information directly from the cerebral cortex). Corticospinal fibers destined for the legs are spared due to their more external location in the spinal cord.

Ischemia of the spinal cord is reduced blood flow to the spinal cord which is supplied by the anterior spinal artery and the paired posterior spinal arteries.  This condition may be associated with arterioscleorosis, trauma, emboli, diseases of the aorta, and other disorders.  Prolonged ischemia may lead to [[infarction]] of the spinal cord tissue.<ref name=Reference.MD>{{cite web|title=Spinal Cord Ischemia|url=http://www.reference.md/files/D020/mD020760.html|publisher=reference.MD|accessdate=12/12/2012}}</ref>   Ischemia of the spinal cord affects its function and can lead to muscle weakness and paralysis.  The spinal cord may also suffer circulatory impairment if the segmental medullary arteries, particularly the great anterior segmental medullary artery are narrowed by obstructive arterial disease.   When systemic blood pressure drops severely for 3-6 min, blood flow from the segmental medullary arteries to the anterior spinal artery supplying the midthoracic region of the spinal cord may be reduced or stopped.  These people may also lose sensation and voluntary movement in the areas supplied by the affected level of the spinal cord. <ref>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Keith|title=Clinically Oriented Anatomy|year=2006|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philidelphia|isbn=0-7817-3639-0|pages=530–531}}</ref>  

This clinical pattern may emerge during recovery from spinal shock due to prolonged swelling around or near the vertebrae, causing pressures on the cord.  The symptoms may be transient or permanent.

[[Anterior cord syndrome]] is often associated with flexion type injuries to the cervical spine, causing damage to the anterior portion of the spinal cord and/or the blood supply from the anterior spinal artery.<ref name="Sullivan">{{cite book |author1=Fulk GD |author2=Schmitz TJ |author3=Behrman AL |year=2007 |contribution=Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury: Clinical Syndromes |editor=S.B. O'Sullivan |editor2=T.J. Schmitz |title=Physical Rehabilitation |edition=5th |pages=937–97 |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |publisher=F.A. Davis }}</ref>  Below the level of injury motor function, pain sensation, and temperature sensation are lost.  While touch, [[proprioception]] (sense of position in space), and sense of vibration remain intact.  

[[Posterior cord syndrome]] can also occur, but is very rare.  Damage to the posterior portion of the spinal cord and/or interruption to the posterior spinal artery causes the loss of proprioception and [[epicritic sensation]] (e.g.: stereognosis, graphesthesia) below the level of injury.<ref name="Sullivan" />  Motor function, sense of pain, and sensitivity to light touch remain intact.<ref name="Sullivan" />

[[Brown-Séquard syndrome]] usually occurs when the spinal cord is hemisectioned or injured on the lateral side.  True hemisections of the spinal cord are rare, while partial lesions due to penetrating wounds (e.g.: gunshot wounds or knife penetrations) are more common.<ref name="Sullivan" />  On the ipsilateral side of the injury (same side), there is a loss of motor function, proprioception, vibration, and light touch.  Contralaterally (opposite side of injury), there is a loss of pain, temperature, and crude touch sensations.  

[[Tabes Dorsalis]] results from injury to the posterior part of the spinal cord, usually from infection diseases such as syphilis, causing loss of touch and proprioceptive sensation.

[[Conus medullaris]] syndrome results from injury to the tip of the spinal cord, located at L1 vertebra.

==Causes==
[[File:Man falling of horse.jpg|thumb|Falling as a part of recreational activities can cause spinal cord injuries.]]

Spinal cord injuries are most often traumatic, caused by lateral bending, dislocation, rotation, axial loading, and hyperflexion or hyperextension of the cord or [[cauda equina]]. [[Motor vehicle accident]]s are the most common cause of SCIs, while other causes include [[Falling (accident)|falls]], work-related accidents, sports injuries, and penetrations such as stab or gunshot wounds.<ref>{{cite book |author = Bogdanov EI |chapter = Spinal Injury |editors = Lisak RP, Truong DD, Carroll WM, Bhidayasiri R |title = International Neurology: A Clinical Approach |publisher = Blackwell Publishing |year = 2009 }}</ref> SCIs can also be of a non-traumatic origin, as in the case of cancer, infection, intervertebral disc disease, vertebral injury and spinal cord vascular disease.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Survival after spinal cord injury: a systematic review|journal=Journal of Neurotrauma|year=2010|volume=27|issue=8|pages=1517–28|doi=10.1089/neu.2009.1138|author=van den Berg MEL, Castellote JM, Pedro-Cuesta J, Mahillo-Fernandez I|pmid=20486810}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
A radiographic evaluation using a [[x-ray]], [[MRI]] or [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]] scan can determine if there is any damage to the spinal cord and where it is located. A neurologic evaluation incorporating sensory testing and reflex testing can help determine the motor function of a person with a SCI.<ref name="manual">{{cite book |author=Andrew B., MD Peitzman; Andrew B.

==Management==
Modern trauma care includes a step called [[clearing the cervical spine]], where a person with a suspected injury is treated as if they have a spinal injury until that injury is ruled out. The objective is to prevent any further spinal cord damage.  People are immobilized at the scene of the injury until it is clear that there is no damage to the highest portions of the spine.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Cervical spine immobilization before admission to the hospital |journal=Neurosurgery |year=2002 |volume=50|pages=S7–17 |doi=10.1097/00006123-200203001-00005 |pmid=12431281 |issue=3 Suppl |last1=&Na; }}</ref> This is traditionally done using a device called a [[long spine board]] and [[hard collar]].

Once at a hospital and immediate life-threatening injuries have been addressed, they are evaluated for spinal injury, typically by [[x-ray]] or [[CT scan]]. Complications of spinal cord injuries include [[neurogenic shock]], [[respiratory failure]], [[pulmonary edema]], [[pneumonia]], [[pulmonary embolus|pulmonary emboli]] and [[deep venous thrombosis]], many of which can be recognized early in treatment and avoided.  SCI patients often require extended treatment in an [[intensive care unit]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Management of acute spinal cord injuries in an intensive care unit or other monitored setting |journal=Neurosurgery |year=2002 |volume=50 |pages=S51–7 |doi=10.1097/00006123-200203001-00011 |pmid=12431287 |issue=3 Suppl |last1=&Na; }}</ref>

{{anchor|traction}}
Techniques of immobilizing the affected areas in the hospital include ''Gardner-Wells tongs'', which can also exert spinal traction to reduce a fracture or dislocation.<ref>{{cite pmid|2711238}}</ref>

One experimental treatment, [[therapeutic hypothermia]], is used but there is no evidence that it improves outcomes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/812407-overview |title=Therapeutic Hypothermia: eMedicine Clinical Procedures |accessdate=2011-02-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinesection.org/hypothermia.php |title=Hypothermia |format= |work= |accessdate=2011-02-21}}</ref> Maintaining mean arterial blood pressures of at least 85 to 90 mmHg using intravenous fluids, [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]], and [[vasopressor]]s to ensure adequate blood supply to nerves and prevent damage is another treatment with little evidence of effectiveness.<ref>Neurosurgery. 2002;50(3 Suppl):S58-62.</ref>

===Surgery===
Surgery may also be necessary to remove any bone fragments from the spinal canal and to stabilize the spine.<ref name="fof">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia = The Facts On File Encyclopedia of Health and Medicine |title = Spinal cord injury (SCI)|publisher = Facts On File}}</ref>  [[Inflammation]] can cause further damage to the spinal cord, and patients are sometimes treated with a corticosteroid drug such as [[methylprednisolone]] to reduce swelling.

=== Rehabilitation ===
{{Main|Rehabilitation in spinal cord injury}}
When treating a patient with a SCI, repairing the damage created by injury is the ultimate goal. By using a variety of treatments, greater improvements are achieved, and, therefore, treatment should not be limited to one method. Furthermore, increasing activity will increase his/her chances of recovery.<ref name="Frood, R. 2010">{{cite journal |author1=Frood R |title=The use of treadmill training to recover locomotor ability in patients with spinal cord injury |journal=Oxford Journals |year=2010|volume=4|pages=108–117 }}</ref>

The rehabilitation process following a spinal cord injury typically begins in the acute care setting. Physical therapists, occupational therapists, social workers, psychologists and other health care professionals typically work as a team under the coordination of a physiatrist to decide on goals with the patient and develop a plan of discharge that is appropriate for the patient’s condition. 

In the acute phase physical therapists focus on the patient’s respiratory status, prevention of indirect complications (such as pressure sores), maintaining range of motion, and keeping available musculature active.<ref name="Fulk, G. 2007">{{cite book |author1=Fulk G |author2=Schmitz T |author3=Behrman A |year=2007 |contribution=Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury |editor=O'Sullivan S |editor2=Schmitz T |title=Physical Rehabilitation |edition=5th  |pages=937–96 |location=Philidelphia Pennsylvania |publisher=F.A.

Depending on the Neurological Level of Impairment (NLI), the muscles responsible for expanding the thorax, which facilitate inhalation, may be affected. If the NLI is such that it affects some of the ventilatory muscles, more emphasis will then be placed on the muscles with intact function. For example, the intercostal muscles receive their innervation from T1 - T11, and if any are damaged, more emphasis will need to placed on the unaffected muscles which are innervated from higher levels of the CNS.  As SCI patients suffer from reduced [[total lung capacity]] and [[tidal volume]] <ref name="Winslow C">{{cite journal |author1=Winslow C, |author2=Rozovsky J |title=Effect of spinal cord injury on the respiratory system |journal=Am J Phys Med Rehabil |year=2003|volume=82|pages=803–814 }}</ref> it is pertinent that physical therapists teach SCI patients accessory breathing techniques (e.g. apical breathing, [[glossopharyngeal breathing]], etc.) that typically are not taught to healthy individuals.

====Outcome measures====

The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is an assessment tool that aims to evaluate the functional status of patients throughout the rehabilitation process following a [[stroke]], [[traumatic brain injury]], spinal cord injury or [[cancer]].<ref name=Chumney>{{cite journal | title = Ability of Functional Independence Measure to accurately predict functional outcome of stroke-specific population: Systematic review | journal = Journal of Rehabilitation Research & Development | year = 2010 | first = D. | last = Chumney | coauthors = Nollinger, K., Shesko, K., Skop, K., Spencer, M., & Newton, R.A. | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–30| pmid = 20437324 | DOI = 10.1682/JRRD.2009.08.0140}}</ref> Its area of use can include skilled nursing facilities and hospitals aimed at acute, sub-acute and rehabilitation care. It serves as a consistent data collection tool for the comparison of rehabilitation outcomes across the health care continuum.<ref name=Chumney /> Furthermore, it aims to allow clinicians to track changes in the functional status of patients from the onset of rehab care through discharge and follow-up. The FIM’s assessment of degree of disability depends on the patient’s score in 18 categories, focusing on motor and cognitive function. Each category or item is rated on a 7-point scale (1 = <25% independence; total assistance required, 7 = 100% independence).<ref name=Chumney /> As such, FIM scores may be interpreted to indicate level of independence or level of burden of care.

== Prognosis ==

Spinal cord injuries frequently result in at least some [[incurable]] impairment even with the best possible treatment. In general, patients with complete injuries recover very little lost function and patients with incomplete injuries have more hope of recovery. Some patients that are initially assessed as having complete injuries are later reclassified as having incomplete injuries.

The place of the injury determines which parts of the body are affected.  The severity of the injury determines how much the body will be affected.  Consequently, a person with a mild, incomplete injury at the T5 vertebrae will have a much better chance of using his or her legs than a person with a severe, complete injury at exactly the same place in the spine.

Recovery is typically quickest during the first six months, with very few patients experiencing any substantial recovery more than nine months after the injury.<ref name="Recovery">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Recovery+following+spinal+cord+injury.-a019662789|title=Recovery following spinal cord injury|author=Yakura, Joy S.|publisher=American Rehabilitation|date=Dec 22, 1996|accessdate=15 March 2011}}</ref>

===Tetraplegia (quadriplegia)===

The ASIA motor score (AMS) is a 100 point score based on ten pairs of muscles each given a five point rating.  A person with no injury should score 100.  In complete tetraplegia, a recovery of nine points on this scale is average regardless of where the patient starts.  Patients with higher levels of injury will typically have lower starting scores.<ref name="Recovery"/>

In incomplete tetraplegia, 46 percent of patients were able to walk one year after injury, though they may require assistance such as crutches and braces.  These patients had similar recovery in muscles of the upper and lower body.  Patients who had pinprick sensation in the sacral dermatomes such as the anus recovered better than patients that could only sense a light touch.<ref name="Recovery"/>

===Paraplegia===
[[File:Holly Koester, 2007 Chevron Houston Marathon (357322273).jpg|thumb|Holly Koester incurred a spinal injury as a result of a motor vehicle accident and is now a [[wheelchair racer]].]]
In one study on 142 individuals after one year of complete paraplegia, none of the patients where the initial injury was above the ninth thoracic vertebra (T9) were able to recover completely.  Less than half, 38 percent, of the studied subjects had any sort of recovery.  Very few, five percent, recovered enough function to walk, and those required crutches and other assistive devices, and all of them had injuries below T11.  A few of the patients, four percent, had what were originally classified as complete injuries and were reassessed as having incomplete injuries, but only half of that four percent regained bowel and bladder control.<ref name="Recovery"/>

Of the 54 patients in the same study with incomplete paraplegia 76 percent were able to walk with assistance after one year.  On average, patients improved 12 points on the 50 point lower extremity motor score (LEMS) scale.  The amount of improvement was not dependent on the location of the injury, but patients with higher injuries had lower initial motor scores and correspondingly lower final motor scores.  A LEMS of 50 is normal, and scores of 30 or higher typically predict ability to walk.<ref name="Recovery"/>

== Epidemiology ==
Spinal injury can occur without [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]]. Many people suffer transient loss of function ("stingers") in sports accidents or pain in "whiplash" of the neck without neurological loss and relatively few of these suffer spinal cord injury sufficient to warrant hospitalization.  The prevalence of spinal cord injury is not well known in many large countries. In some countries, such as Sweden and Iceland, registries are available.  In the United States, the incidence of spinal cord injury has been estimated to be about 40 cases (per 1 million people) per year or around 12,000 cases per year.<ref name=FSCIP>{{cite web|url=http://www.fscip.org/facts.htm|title=Spinal Cord Injury Facts|author=|date=June 2009|publisher=Foundation for Spinal Cord Injury Prevention, Care & Cure|accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="pmid21062296">{{cite journal |author=Qin W, Bauman WA, Cardozo C |title=Bone and muscle loss after spinal cord injury: organ interactions |journal=Ann.

==Research directions==
Scientists are investigating many promising avenues for treatment of spinal cord injury.  Numerous articles in the medical literature describe research, mostly in animal models, aimed at reducing the paralyzing effects of injury and promoting regrowth of functional nerve fibers.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16235699 | doi=10.3171/spi.2005.3.3.0173 | volume=3 | issue=3 | title=Clinical experience using incubated autologous macrophages as a treatment for complete spinal cord injury: phase I study results | year=2005 | month=September | author=Knoller N, Auerbach G, Fulga V, ''et al.'' | journal=J Neurosurg Spine | pages=173–81}}</ref>  Despite the devastating effects of the condition, commercial funding for research investigating a cure after spinal cord injury is limited, partially due to the small size of the population of potential beneficiaries.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Some experimental treatments, such as systemic hypothermia, have been performed in isolated cases in order draw attention to the need for further preclinical and clinical studies to help clarify the role of hypothermia in acute spinal cord injury.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 20081503 | doi=10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181b9dc28 | volume=35 | issue=2 | title=The use of systemic hypothermia for the treatment of an acute cervical spinal cord injury in a professional football player | year=2010 | month=January | author=Cappuccino A, Bisson LJ, Carpenter B, Marzo J, Dietrich WD, Cappuccino H | journal=Spine | pages=E57–62}}</ref>   Despite the limitation on funding, a number of experimental treatments such as local spine cooling and oscillating field stimulation have reached controlled human trials,<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 6495017 | volume=9 | issue=5 | title=Current status of spinal cord cooling in the treatment of acute spinal cord injury | year=1984 | author=Hansebout RR, Tanner JA, Romero-Sierra C | journal=Spine | pages=508–11}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15658119 | doi=10.3171/spi.2005.2.1.0003 | volume=2 | issue=1 | title=Oscillating field stimulation for complete spinal cord injury in humans: a phase 1 trial | year=2005 | month=January | author=Shapiro S, Borgens R, Pascuzzi R, ''et al.'' | journal=J Neurosurg Spine | pages=3–10}}</ref>
 
Advances in identification of an effective therapeutic target after spinal cord injury have been newsworthy, and considerable media attention is often drawn towards new developments in this area. However, aside from methylprednisolone, none of these developments have reached even limited use in the clinical care of human spinal cord injury in the U.S.<ref>Cadotte DW, Fehlings MG (2011). [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21080129 Spinal cord injury: a systematic review of current treatment options.] ''Clin Orthop Relat Res.'' 469(3): 732-741.</ref>

===Stem cells===
Around the world, proprietary centers offering [[stem cell]] transplants and treatment with neuroregenerative substances are fueled by glowing testimonial reports of neurological improvement. It is also evident that when stem cells are injected in the area of damage in the spinal cord, they secrete neurotrophic factors, and these neurotrophic factors help neurons and vessels grow, thus helping repair the damage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Abraham S |title=Autologous Stem Cell Injections for Spinal Cord Injury - A multicentric Study with 6 month follow up of 108 patients|journal=7th Annual Meeting of Japanese Society of Regenerative Medicine, Nagoya, Japan|year=2008 |month=March}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=R Ravikumar, S Narayanan and S Abraham|title=Autologous stem cells for spinal cord injury|journal=Regenerative Medicine|volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=53–61 |year=2007 |month=Nov}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Abraham S |title=Autologous Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cells for spinal cord injury- A case report|journal=Cytotherapy|volume=9 |issue=1|year=2007 |month=June}}</ref> Bone Marrow Stem cells especially the CD34+ cells have been found to be relatively more in men compared to women in the reproductive age group among spinal cord injury patients.<ref name="Dedeepiya V" />

In 2009 the FDA approved the country's first human trial on embryonic stem cell transplantation into patients suffering from varying levels of traumatic spinal cord injury.<ref>"FDA Approves a Stem Cell Trial"". The New York Times. Andrew Pollack. January 23, 2009.</ref> The trial however came to a halt in November 2011 when the company, which was financing the trial, announced the discontinuation of the trial due to financial issues.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Frantz S  | year=2012 | title=Embryonic stem cell pioneer Geron exits field, cuts losses| journal= Nature Biotechnology| doi=10.1038/nbt0112-12}}</ref> It is important to note that only financial issues led to the trial being discontinued and not any scientific or ethical reasons.<ref name="JSRM editorial">{{cite journal | author=Editorial | year=2012 | title=Cell Based Therapies: At Crossroads to find the right Cell source| journal= Journal of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine| url=http://www.pubstemcell.com/monthly/008010100001.htm/}}</ref> 

Other than stem cells, transplantation of tissues such as olfactory ensheathing mucosa have been shown to produce beneficial effects in spinal cord injured rats.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 18695502| volume=19 | issue=13 | title=Transplantation of olfactory mucosa following spinal cord injury

Independent validation of the results of the various stem cell treatments is lacking.<ref>Fehlings, M. G. and R. Vawda (2011). "Cellular treatments for spinal cord injury: the time is right for clinical trials." Neurotherapeutics 8(4): 704-720.</ref><ref>Dobkin, BH.; Curt, A.; Guest, J.

===Engineering approaches===
Recent approaches have used various engineering techniques to improve spinal cord injury repair. The general hypothesis of this is that bridging the lesion site using a growth permissive scaffold may promote axonal extension and in turn improve behavioral function. Engineered treatments are ideal for spinal cord injury repair because they do not induce an immune response like biological treatments, and they are easily tunable and reproducible. ''In-vivo'' administration of hydrogels or self-assembling nanofibers has been shown to promote axonal sprouting and partial functional recovery.<ref>Piantino J, Burdick J A, Goldberg D, Langer R, Benowitz L I (2006). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014488606002731 An injectable, biodegradable hydrogel for trophic factor delivery enhances axonal rewiring and improves performance after spinal cord injury]. ''Exp Neurol.'' 201: 359-367.</ref><ref>Tysseling-Mattiace VM, Sahni V, Niece KL, Birch D, Czeisler C, Fehlings MG, Stupp SI, Kessler JA (2008): [http://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/14/3814.short Self-assembling nanofibers inhibit glial scar formation and promote axon elongation after spinal cord injury]. ''J Neuroscience'' 28: 3814-3823.</ref>  In addition, administration of carbon nanotubes has shown to increase motor axon extension, decrease the lesion volume, and not induce neuropathic pain.<ref>Roman JA, Niedzielko TL, Haddon RC, Parpura V, Floyd CL (2011). [http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/neu.2010.1409 Single-walled carbon nanotubes chemically-functionalized with polyethylene glycol promote tissue repair in a rat model of spinal cord injury]. ''J Neurotrauma''. 28:11. 2349-2362.</ref> In addition, administration of poly-lactic acid microfibers has shown that topographical guidance cues alone can promote axonal regeneration into the injury site.<ref>Hurtado A, Cregg JM, Wang HB, Wendell DF, Oudega M, Gilbert RJ, McDonald JW (2011). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961211005126 Robust CNS regeneration after complete spinal cord transection using aligned poly-l-lactic acid microfibers ]. ''Biomaterials''. 32(26): 6068-6079.</ref> However, all of these approaches induced modest behavioral or functional recovery suggesting that further investigation is necessary.

===BCI===
Recent research shows that combining [[brain–computer interface]] and [[functional electrical stimulation]] can restore voluntary control of paralyzed muscles. A study with monkeys showed that it is possible to directly use commands from the brain, bypassing the spinal cord and enable limited hand control and function.<ref>C. Ethier, E. R. Oby,  M. J. Bauman, L. E. Miller: [http://211.144.68.84:9998/91keshi/Public/File/34/485-7398/pdf/nature10987.pdf Restoration of grasp following paralysis through brain-controlled stimulation of muscles].
