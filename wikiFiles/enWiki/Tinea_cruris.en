In the [[Germany|German]] [[Sprachraum]] this condition is called ''Tinea inguinalis'' (from Latin ''inguen'' = [[groin]]) whereas ''Tinea cruris'' is used for a dermatophytosis of the [[Crus (lower leg)|lower leg]] (Latin ''crus'').<ref>{{ cite book | author = Altmeyer, P.; Bacharach-Buhles, M. | title = Enzyklopädie Dermatologie, Allergologie, Umweltmedizin | publisher = Springer | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-3-540-41361-5 | page = 1580 }}</ref>

Tinea Cruris is similar to, but  different from [[Candidal intertrigo]], which is an infection of the skin by ''[[Candida albicans]]''. It is more specifically located between [[intertriginous]] folds of adjacent skin, which can be present in the groin or scrotum, and be indistinguishable from fungal infections caused by ''Tinia''. However, candidal infections tend to both appear and disappear with treatment more quickly.<ref name="Andrews"/>{{rp|309}}  It is also worth noting that tinea cruris generally does not infect the scrotum. 

==Symptoms and signs==
As the common name for this condition implies, it causes [[itch]]ing or a burning sensation in the groin area, thigh [[skin fold]]s, or anus. It may involve the inner thighs and genital areas, as well as extending back to the [[perineum]] and perianal areas.

Affected areas may appear red, tan, or brown, with flaking, rippling, peeling, or cracking skin.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.med.nyu.edu/patientcare/library/article.html?ChunkIID=11736 | title = Jock itch | publisher = NYU Langone Medical Center }}</ref>

[[File:Ji2.jpg|thumb|left|Red rash caused by Tinea cruris on the groin]]

The acute infection begins with an area in the groin fold about a half-inch across, usually on both sides. The area may enlarge, and other sores may develop in no particular pattern. The rash appears as raised red plaques (platelike areas) and scaly patches with sharply defined borders that may blister and ooze.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000876.htm#Symptoms | title = Jock itch | publisher = NLM / NIH | work = MedlinePlus }}</ref>

If the rash advances, it usually advances down the  thigh. The advancing edge is redder and more raised than areas that have been infected longer. The advancing edge is usually scaly, and very easily distinguished or well demarcated. 

The skin within the border turns a reddish-brown and loses much of its scale. The border may exhibit tiny [[pimple]]s or even [[pustule]]s, with central areas that are reddish and dry with small scales.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.emedicinehealth.com/jock_itch/page3_em.htm | title = Jock itch | publisher = Emedicinehealth.com }}</ref><ref>{{ cite web | url = http://dermatology.about.com/cs/fungalinfections/a/jockitch.htm | title = Jock itch | publisher = Dermatology.about.com }}</ref>

If infected with [[candidal]] organisms, the rash tends to be redder and wetter. The skin of the [[penis]] may be involved, whereas other organisms spare the penis.

==Causes==

[[Opportunistic infection]]s (infections that are caused by a diminished [[immune system]]) are frequent. [[Fungus]] from an [[athlete's foot]] infection can spread to the groin through clothing. Tight, restrictive clothing, such as [[jockstrap | jockstraps]], traps heat and moisture, providing an ideal environment for the fungus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jockitch.me/causes.html |title=Causes of Jock Itch |accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref>

The type of fungus that most commonly causes tinea cruris is called ''[[Trichophyton rubrum]]''. Some other contributing fungi are ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Trichophyton mentagrophytes]]'' and ''[[Epidermophyton floccosum]]''.

==Prevention==
Medical professionals suggest keeping the groin area clean and dry by drying off thoroughly after bathing and putting on dry clothing right away after swimming or perspiring.

Other recommendations are: not sharing clothing or towels with others, showering immediately after athletic activities, wearing loose cotton underwear, avoiding tight-fitting clothes, and using antifungal powders.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.crutchfielddermatology.com/treatments/jockitch/ | publisher = Crutchfield Dermatology | title = Jock itch }}</ref><ref> {{ cite web | url = http://www.everydayhealth.com/health-information/jock-itch-tinea-cruris-prevention.aspx#continue | work = Everydayhealth | publisher = Harvard Health Publications | title = Jock Itch Causes, Symptoms and Treatment }}</ref>

==Treatment==
Tinea cruris is best treated with topical [[antifungal medication]]s of the [[Antifungal medication#Allylamines|allylamine]] or [[Antifungal medication#Imidazole, triazole, and thiazole antifungals|azole]] type.<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Nadalo, D.; Montoya, C.; Hunter-Smith, D. | title = What is the best way to treat tinea cruris? | journal = The Journal of Family Practice | year = 2006 | volume = 55 | issue = 3 | pages = 256–258 | pmid = 16510062 }}</ref> These anti-fungal agents stop fungi from producing [[ergosterol]], an essential component of fungal cell membranes. If ergosterol synthesis is completely or partially inhibited, the fungal cell is unable to construct an intact cell membrane, and dies. [[Antifungal medication#Allylamines|Allylamines]] and thiocarbamate antifungals ([[tolnaftate]], ''Tinactin'' etc.) are effective against ''Tinea cruris'', but not against ''[[Candida albicans]]'', which requires an [[Antifungal medication#Imidazole, triazole, and thiazole antifungals|azole]] type drug, making azole drugs, effective against both types of infections, the first choice for topical treatment of infections of unknown etiology in [[intertriginous]] areas.

If the skin inflammation causes discomfort and itching, [[glucocorticoid]] [[steroid]]s (such as 1% [[hydrocortisone]] cream)  may be combined with the anti-fungal drug to help prevent further irritation due to the patient scratching the area. Apart from the quicker relief of symptoms, this also helps minimize the risk of secondary bacterial infection caused by the scratching. However, steroids may exacerbate the condition if used alone for fungal infections because they hinder the body's immune system.

Since fungi tend to thrive in warm, dark, damp conditions, minimizing these conditions can help treat and prevent this rash. Some useful measures are: wearing boxer underwear or no underwear, increasing air-flow by sleeping near a fan, wearing loose sleepwear or no sleepwear, exposing the area to wind and sun, and thoroughly cleaning the area with a hand-held showerhead and soap.
