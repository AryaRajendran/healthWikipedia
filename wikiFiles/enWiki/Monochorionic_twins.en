'''Monochorionic twins''' are [[monozygotic]] (identical) [[twins]] that share the same [[placenta]].  If the placenta is shared by more than two twins (see [[multiple birth]]),  these are '''monochorionic multiples'''.  Monochorionic twins occur in 0.3% of all pregnancies.<ref name=cordero>{{cite journal |author=Cordero L, Franco A, Joy SD, O'shaughnessy RW |title=Monochorionic diamniotic infants without twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome |journal=J Perinatol |volume=25 |issue=12 |pages=753–8 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16281049 |doi=10.1038/sj.jp.7211405 |url=}}</ref> 75% of [[monozygotic]] twin pregnancies are monochorionic;  the remaining 25% are ''dichorionic diamniotic''.<ref name=Shulman/>  If the placenta divides, this takes place after the third day after [[fertilization]].<ref name=Shulman>{{cite book |author=Shulman, Lee S.; Vugt, John M.

==Amniocity and zygosity==
Monochorionic twins generally have two [[amniotic sac]]s (called Monochorionic-Diamniotic "MoDi"), but sometimes, in the case of [[monoamniotic twins]] (Monochorionic-Monoamniotic "MoMo"), they also share the same amniotic sac. Monoamniotic twins occur when the split takes place after the ninth day after fertilization.<ref name=Shulman/> Monoamniotic twins are ''always'' [[monozygotic]] (identical twins).<ref name=pregnancy-info>[http://www.pregnancy-info.net/monoamniotic.html Pregnancy-Info -- > Monoamniotic Twins] Retrieved on July 9, 2009</ref> Monochorionic-Diamniotic twins are ''almost always'' monozygotic, with a few exceptions where the [[blastocysts]] have fused.<ref name=Shulman/>

==Diagnosis==
By performing an [[obstetric ultrasound]] at a [[gestational age]] of 10-14 weeks, monochorionic-diamniotic twins are discerned from dichorionic twins by the presence of a "T-sign" at the inter-twin membrane-placental junction (that is, the junction between the inter-twin membrane and the external rim forms a [[right angle]]), whereas dichorionic twins present with a "lambda (λ) sign" (that is, the chorion forms a [[Wedge (mechanical device)|wedge]]-shaped protrusion into the inter-twin space, creating a rather curved junction).<ref name=Sepulveda1996>{{cite pmid|8807758}}</ref> The "lambda sign" is also called the "twin peak sign". At ultrasound at a gestational age of 16-20 weeks, the "lambda sign" is indicative of dichorionicity but its absence does not exclude it.<ref>{{cite pmid|9052601}}</ref>

In contrast, the placentas may be overlapping for dichorionic twins, making it hard to distinguish them, making it difficult to discern mono- or dichorionic twins on solely the appearance of the placentas on ultrasound.

==Complications==
In addition to a shared placenta, monochorionic twins also have their [[circulatory system]]s intermingled in random and unpredictable [[circulatory anastomoses]]. This can cause disproportionate blood supply, resulting in [[twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome]] (TTTS) in 20%<ref name=cordero/> of MoDi pregnancies. This is the main complication of monochorionic twins.

The 80% that of MoDi pregnancies without TTTS still have high rates of birth weight discordance, [[fetal growth restriction]], prematurity and resultant [[cesarean section]] deliveries.<ref name=cordero/> One twin may also fail to develop a proper heart and become dependent on the pumping activity of the other twin's heart, resulting in [[twin reversed arterial perfusion]].<ref name=Shulman/> If one twin dies in utero, blood accumulates in that twin's body, causing [[exsanguination]] of the remaining twin.<ref name=Shulman/> 

In the case of [[monochorionic-monoamniotic twins]] the risk of complications is substantially higher because of additional potential umbilical [[cord entanglement]] and [[Umbilical cord compression|compression]].<ref name=pregnancy-info/>  However, the [[perinatal mortality]] of monochorionic twins is fairly low.<ref name=cordero/>
