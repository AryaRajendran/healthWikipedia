A closely related compound is '''guaietolin''' (3-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)propane-1,2-diol) which is used for similar purposes. {{cn|date=March 2013}}<!-- The two are almost identical, is it worth creating a separate article? -->

==History==
Similar medicines derived from the [[guaiacum|guaiac tree]] were in use as a generic remedy by American Indians when explorers reached [[North America]] in the 16th century. The Spanish encountered guaiacum wood "when they conquered Santo Domingo; it was soon brought back to Europe, where it acquired an immense reputation in the sixteenth century as a cure for syphilis and certain other diseases..."<ref name="Wallis1955">{{cite book|last=Wallis|first=Thomas|middle=E|title=Textbook of Pharmacognosy|year=1955}}</ref>

The 1955  edition of the ''Textbook of [[Pharmacognosy]]'' states: "Guaiacum has a local stimulant action which is sometimes useful in sore throat. The resin is used in chronic gout and rheumatism, whilst the wood is an ingredient in the compound concentrated solution of [[Smilax regelii|sarsaparilla]], which was formerly much used as an alternative in syphilis."<ref name="Wallis1955" />

Guaifenesin was first approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1952. Although previously deemed "Generally Regarded as Safe" in its original approval, the drug received a New Drug Application for the extended-release version, which won approval on July 12, 2002.  Because of this, the FDA then issued letters to other manufacturers of ''timed-release'' guaifenesin to stop marketing their unapproved versions, leaving Adams Respiratory Therapeutics in control of the market. Adams was subsequently acquired by [[Reckitt Benckiser]], based on the strength of the marketing generated by Adams' Mucinex brand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rb.com/site/RKBR/Templates/MediaInvestorsGeneral2.aspx?pageid=262&cc=GB |title=Announcements RB Press release - 10/12/2007 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Jacob |last=Goldstein |title=FDA Bumps Phlegm-Fighters From Market |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2007/05/25/fda-bumps-phlegm-fighters-from-market/ |date=25 May 2007 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref>

==Availability==

{{Globalize|section|North America|date=February 2012}}

Guaifenesin is sold as pills or syrups under many [[brand name]]s.  Single-ingredient formulations of guaifenesin are available, and it is also included in many other over-the-counter cough and cold remedy combinations (usually in conjunction with [[dextromethorphan]] and/or [[acetaminophen]] and/or [[ephedrine]]/[[pseudoephedrine]] or [[phenylephrine]]).  Guaifenesin is a component of [[Mucinex]], [[Robitussin DAC]], [[Cheratussin DAC]], [[Robitussin AC]], [[Cheratussin AC]], [[Benylin]], [[Buckley's]], [[DayQuil]] Mucus Control, Meltus, and Bidex 400, as well as Buckley's Cough, Mucus & Phlegm, Walmart Equate Tussin, and Cough Be Gone.

==Medical Uses==
===Cough===
The principal use of guaifenesin is in the treatment of coughing. A [[Cochrane Collaboration]] meta-analysis of [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter medicines]] for acute cough in children and adults concluded that there was not enough high quality clinical data to prove or disprove the effectiveness of any examined drug including guaifenesin.<ref>{{cite journal

===Mechanism of action===
Guaifenesin is thought to act as an expectorant by increasing the volume and reducing the viscosity of secretions in the trachea and bronchi. It also stimulates the flow of respiratory tract secretions, allowing ciliary movement to carry the loosened secretions upward toward the pharynx.<ref>Gutierrez, K. (2007). Pharmacotherapeutics: Clinical Reasoning in Primary Care. W.B. Saunders Co.</ref> Thus, it may increase the efficiency of the cough reflex and facilitate removal of the secretions; however, objective evidence for this is limited and conflicting.{{cn|date=March 2013}}

==Side-effects==
Known dose-dependent side-effects include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]] (more likely when taken in tablet form without adequate liquid intake), and (rarely) the formation of [[kidney stone]]s of uric acid ([[uric acid nephrolithiasis]]),<ref>{{cite journal

}}</ref> as well as diarrhea, constipation, or other side effects.<ref>Guaifenesin Side Effects 

http://www.drugs.com/sfx/guaifenesin-side-effects.html</ref>  Nausea and vomiting can be reduced by taking guaifenesin with meals.<ref name="Drugs.com"/>  The risk of forming kidney stones during prolonged use can be reduced by maintaining good [[Rehydration|hydration]] and increasing the [[pH]] of urine (see [[Uric acid nephrolithiasis]]). Rarely, severe allergic reactions may occur, including a rash or swelling of the lips or face, which may require urgent medical assistance.  Mild [[dry mouth]] or [[chapped lips]] may also occur when taking this medication. Drinking a glass of water is recommended each time one takes guaifenesin.<ref>Guaifenesin http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682494.html</ref>  Water helps to reduce [[dry mouth]], [[chapped lips]], and the risk of [[kidney stones]], and increases the effectiveness of the drug in hydrating mucus.

Guaifenesin "increases the [[analgesic]] effect of [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) and [[aspirin]], increases the sedative effects of alcohol, tranquilisers, sleep-pills and total anesthetics. Guaifenesin increases the effects of medication that decrease muscle tone. Guaifenesin effects are increased by lithium and magnesium."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teva.cz/files/pdf/pistoptussin_kapky.pdf |title=STOPTUSSIN |publisher=Teva |date= |accessdate=2013-01-28}}</ref>

==Veterinary use==
Guaifenesin's neurological properties first became known in the late 1940s, and it is widely used in [[veterinary]] medicine to induce and maintain [[anesthesia]] in [[horses]]<ref>{{cite journal
