'''Isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency''' ('''ILD'''), also called '''isolated 17,20-desmolase deficiency''', is a rare [[endocrine disease|endocrine]] and [[autosomal recessive]] [[genetic disorder]] which is characterized by a complete or partial loss of [[17,20-lyase]] activity and, in turn, impaired [[biosynthesis|production]] of the [[androgen]] and [[estrogen]] [[sex steroid]]s. The condition manifests itself as [[pseudohermaphroditism]] (partially or fully underdeveloped [[genitalia]]) in males, in whom it is considered to be a form of [[intersex]], and, in both [[sex|sexes]], as a reduced or absent [[puberty]]/lack of development of [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s, resulting in a somewhat childlike appearance in adulthood (if left untreated).<ref name="EndoTextPediatrics">{{cite web | url = http://www.endotext.org/pediatrics/pediatrics11/pediatrics11_2.htm#CYP17_(17,20_lyase_activity)_Deficiency | title = Chapter 11 – 46,XY Disorders of Sexual Development | format = HTML | work = Pediatric Endocrinology | accessdate = 2012-05-25}}</ref><ref name="RungePatterson2006">{{cite book | author1 = Marschall Stevens Runge | author2 = Cam Patterson | title = Principles of Molecular Medicine | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=j-_rAKRf3WwC&pg=PA483 | accessdate = 25 May 2012 | date = 20 June 2006 | publisher = Humana Press | isbn = 978-1-58829-202-5 | page = 483}}</ref><ref name="Handwerger1999">{{cite book|author=Stuart Handwerger|title=Molecular and Cellular Pediatric Endocrinology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uE597FpLjN4C&pg=PA148|accessdate=25 May 2012|date=26 February 1999|publisher=Humana Press|isbn=978-0-89603-406-8|pages=148–}}</ref><ref name="pmid22072737">{{cite journal | author = Miller WL | title = The syndrome of 17,20 lyase deficiency | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 97 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–67 | year = 2012 | month = January | pmid = 22072737 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2011-2161 | url = http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=22072737}}</ref>

Unlike the case of [[combined 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency]], isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency does not affect [[glucocorticoid]] production (or [[mineralocorticoid]] levels), and for that reason, does not result in [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia|adrenal hyperplasia]] or [[hypertension]].<ref name="EndoTextPediatrics" /><ref name="Handwerger1999" />

==Cause==
Isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency is caused by [[genetic mutation]]s in the [[gene]] ''[[CYP17A1]]'', which encodes for 17,20-lyase, while not affecting [[17α-hydroxylase]], which is encoded by the same gene.<ref name="RungePatterson2006" /><ref name="pmid22072737" /><ref name="Mason2002">{{cite book | author = J.

Observed [[physiology|physiological]] abnormalities of the condition include markedly elevated [[serum]] levels of [[progestogen]]s such as [[progesterone]] and [[17-hydroxyprogesterone]] (due to [[upregulation]] of [[precursor (biochemistry)|precursor]] availability for androgen and estrogen synthesis), very low or fully absent peripheral concentrations of [[androgen]]s such as [[dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA), [[androstenedione]], and [[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]]s such as [[estradiol]] (due to the lack of 17,20-lyase activity, which is essential for their production), and high serum concentrations of the [[gonadotropin]]s, [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) (due to a lack of [[negative feedback]] on account of the lack of sex hormones).<ref name="pmid15866602">{{cite journal | author = Simsek E, Ozdemir I, Lin L, Achermann JC | title = Isolated 17,20-lyase (desmolase) deficiency in a 46,XX female presenting with delayed puberty | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 83 | issue = 5 | pages = 1548–51 | year = 2005 | month = May | pmid = 15866602 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2004.11.063 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015-0282(05)00358-4}}</ref><ref name="pmid14747197">{{cite journal | author = ten Kate-Booij MJ, Cobbaert C, Koper JW, de Jong FH | title = Deficiency of 17,20-lyase causing giant ovarian cysts in a girl and a female phenotype in her 46,XY sister: case report | journal = Human Reproduction (Oxford, England) | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 456–9 | year = 2004 | month = February | pmid = 14747197 | url = http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14747197}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
The [[symptom]]s of isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency, in males, include pseudohermaphroditism (i.e., [[feminization (biology)|feminized]], [[ambiguous genitalia|ambiguous]], or mildly underdeveloped (e.g., [[micropenis]], [[perineal hypospadias]], and/or [[cryptorchidism]] (undescended testes)) [[external genitalia]]), female [[gender identity]], and, in non-complete cases of deficiency where partial [[virilization]] occurs, [[gynecomastia]] up to [[Tanner scale|Tanner stage V]] (due to low androgen levels, which results in a lack of suppression of estrogen); in females, [[amenorrhoea]] or, in cases of only partial deficiency, merely [[irregular menses]], and enlarged [[ovarian cyst|cystic ovaries]] (due to excessive stimulation by high levels of gonadotropins); and in both sexes, [[hypergonadotropic hypogonadism]] ([[hypogonadism]] despite high levels of gonadotropins), delayed, impaired, or fully absent [[adrenarche]] and [[puberty]] with an associated reduction in or complete lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics ([[sexual infantilism]]), impaired [[fertility]] or complete [[sterility]], [[tall stature]] (due to delayed [[epiphyseal closure]]), [[eunuch|eunuchoid]] [[human skeleton|skeletal]] proportions, delayed or absent [[bone maturation]], and [[osteoporosis]].<ref name="EndoTextPediatrics" /><ref name="Handwerger1999" /><ref name="pmid22072737" /><ref name="pmid15866602" />

==Treatment==
Males and females may be treated with [[hormone replacement therapy]] (i.e., with androgens and estrogens, respectively), which will result in normal [[sexual development]] and resolve most symptoms. In the case of 46,XY (genetically male) individuals who are phenotypically female and/or identify as the female gender, they should be treated with estrogens instead. Removal of the undescended testes should be performed in 46,XY females to prevent their [[malignant transformation|malignant degeneration]], whereas in 46,XY males surgical correction of the genitals is generally required, and, if necessary, an [[orchidopexy]] (relocation of the undescended testes to the scrotum) may be performed as well.<ref name="RungePatterson2006" /> Namely in genetic females presenting with ovarian cysts, [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue|GnRH analogue]]s may be used to control high FSH and LH levels if they are unresponsive to estrogens.<ref name="pmid14747197" />
