A '''transient ischemic attack''' ('''TIA''') is a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by [[ischemia]] (loss of blood flow) &ndash; either [[Brain ischemia#Focal brain ischemia|focal brain]], [[spinal cord]] or [[Ocular ischemic syndrome|retinal]] &ndash; without acute [[infarct]]ion (tissue death). TIAs have the same underlying cause as [[stroke]]s: a disruption of [[cerebral blood flow]] (CBF), and are frequently referred to as '''mini-strokes'''. TIAs and strokes cause the same symptoms, such as [[contralateral]] paralysis (opposite side of body from affected brain hemisphere) or sudden weakness or numbness. A TIA may cause sudden dimming or loss of vision ([[amaurosis fugax]]), [[aphasia]], slurred speech ([[dysarthria]]) and mental confusion. But unlike a stroke, the symptoms of a TIA can resolve within a few minutes or 24 hours.  Brain injury may still occur in a TIA lasting only a few minutes. Having a TIA is a risk factor for eventually having a stroke or a [[silent stroke]].<ref>Ferro JM ''et al.'' Diagnosis of transient ischemic attack by the nonneurologist.

A SCI may still cause long lasting neurological dysfunction affecting such areas as [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], personality and cognition. A SCI often occurs before or after  a TIA or major stroke.<ref>Coutts SB, ''et al.'' Silent ischemia in minor stroke and TIA patients identified on MR imaging.

A cerebral [[infarct]] that lasts longer than 24 hours but fewer than 72 hours is called a reversible ischemic neurologic deficit or RIND.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms vary widely from person to person, depending on the area of the brain involved. The most frequent symptoms include temporary loss of vision (typically ''[[amaurosis fugax]]''); difficulty speaking ([[aphasia]]); weakness on one side of the body ([[hemiparesis]]); and numbness or tingling ([[paresthesia]]), usually on one side of the body. Impairment of [[consciousness]] is very uncommon. There have been cases of temporary and partial [[paralysis]] affecting the face and [[tongue]] of the afflicted. The symptoms of a TIA are short-lived and usually last a few seconds to a few minutes and most symptoms disappear within 60 minutes. Some individuals may have a lingering feeling that something odd happened to the body. [[Dizziness]], lack of coordination or poor balance are also symptoms related to TIA. Symptoms vary in severity.

== Causes ==
The most common cause of a TIA is an [[Embolism|embolus]] that occludes an artery in the brain. This usually arises from a dislodged [[Atheroma|atherosclerotic plaque]] in one of the [[carotid artery|carotid arteries]] (''i.e.'' two of the four major arteries supplying the brain) or from a [[thrombus]] (''i.e.'' a blood clot) in the heart because of [[atrial fibrillation]].  In a TIA, the blockage period is very short-lived and hence there is no permanent damage.<ref>[http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4781 What is a TIA or transient ischemic attack?] American Heart Association. Retrieved on 2010-03-07{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref> The cholesterol build-up is gradual and eventually narrows the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]. With time, blood flow to that side of the brain is reduced and a stroke may result. In other cases, cholesterol particles from the atherosclerotic plaque may suddenly break off and enter the brain. In some people, these fragments come off from the [[heart]] and go to the brain. This often happens during a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] or an infection of the [[heart valve|valves]].<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/transientischemicattack.html Transient Ischemic Attack] MedLine Plus. Retrieved on 2010-03-07</ref>

Other reasons include excessive narrowing of large vessels resulting from an atherosclerotic plaque and increased blood viscosity caused by some [[blood diseases]]. TIA is related to other medical conditions such as [[hypertension]], [[heart disease]] (especially [[atrial fibrillation]]), [[migraine]], [[hypercholesterolemia]], and [[diabetes mellitus]].

=== Risk factors ===
* [[Family history (medicine)|Family history]] of stroke or TIA substantially increases risk.
* People 55 years or older are at higher risk.
* Males have a slightly higher risk of TIA than females but females are more likely to die from a stroke.
* High blood pressure
* Diabetes Mellitus
* [[African American]]s generally tend to have a high risk of dying from a stroke, chiefly due to [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and uncontrolled [[diabetes]].<ref>[http://www.stroke.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AAMER African Americans and Stroke] National Stroke Association. Retrieved on 2010-03-07</ref>
* [[Cigarette smoking]]

== Diagnosis ==
TIA will usually be diagnosed after a doctor performs a history and a [[Physical examination|physical exam]]. There are several [[Radiology|radiological]] tests that are done to evaluate patients who have had a TIA. This includes a [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]] or an MRI of the brain, [[ultrasound]] of the neck, an [[Echocardiography|echocardiogram]] of the heart. In most cases, the source of [[atherosclerosis]] is usually identified with an [[ultrasound]].<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/794281-overview Transient Ischemic Attack] eMedicine. Retrieved on 2010-03-07</ref>

=== Differential diagnoses ===
Other diagnoses may have symptoms similar to those of  a TIA:

# Atypical [[migraine]] if visual symptoms occur such as perception of wavy or jagged lines or tiny specks of light and if a headache occurs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Typically a history of prior migraines is present.
# Partial [[seizure]] in the parietal area of the brain
# Glucose abnormalities; these could be distinguished by a history of [[diabetes mellitus]] and a loss of consciousness
# [[Electrolyte abnormalities]]
# [[Hypertensive encephalopathy]] (headache, delirium, hypertension, cerebral edema)
# [[Subdural hematoma]] (history of trauma, headache, loss of consciousness)
# [[Brain tumor]] (mode of onset, progressive headaches, increased intracranial pressure)
# [[Demyelinating disease]]
# [[Conversion disorder]]

== Prevention ==
A TIA may be prevented by changes in lifestyle; although most of these recommendations have no solid empirical data, most medical professionals believe them to be so.<ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Transient-ischaemic-attack/Pages/Prevention.aspx UK National Health advice]</ref> These include:
* Avoiding [[smoking]]
* Cutting down on fats and [[cholesterol]] to help reduce plaque build up
* Eating a healthy diet including plenty of fruits and vegetables
* Limiting [[sodium]] in the diet, thereby reducing blood pressure
* Exercising regularly
* Moderating alcohol intake
* Maintaining a normal weight
* Controlling blood pressure and keeping [[blood sugar]]s under control

== Treatment ==
The mainstay of treatment following acute recovery from a TIA depends on the underlying cause.  It is not always immediately possible to tell the difference between a [[Stroke|CVA]] (stroke) and a TIA.  Most patients who are diagnosed at a hospital's [[emergency department]] as having suffered from a TIA will be discharged home and advised to contact their primary physician to organize further investigations. A TIA can be considered as the last warning. The reason for the condition should be immediately examined by imaging of the brain.  Occasionally, none of these tests will determine the cause, but the symptoms show that the stroke did occur.

To reduce risk of recurrence, it is strongly advised that patients undergo lifestyle changes including quitting smoking, losing weight, eating more fruits and vegetables and exercising regularly.<ref>[http://www.healthtalkonline.org/Nerves_and_brain/transient_ischaemic_attack/Topic/4075/ Lifestyle changes after transient ischaemic attack (TIA)] Healthtalkonline.org. Retrieved on 2013-04-09</ref><ref>[http://www.strokeinfo.org/signsandsymptoms/stroke-facts/reducing-risk-for-a-second-stroke-or-tia/ Reducing risk for a Second Stroke or TIA] strokeinfo.org Retrieved on 2013-04-09</ref>

=== Surgery ===
If the TIA affects an area supplied by the [[carotid artery|carotid arteries]], an [[ultrasound]] ([[Transcranial doppler|TCD]]) scan may demonstrate carotid [[stenosis]]. For people with a greater than 70% stenosis within the carotid artery, removal of atherosclerotic plaque by surgery, specifically a [[carotid endarterectomy]], may be recommended. The blood vessel is opened up and the plaque is removed. The carotid may be replaced with a vessel retrieved from the lower leg or foot. The procedure is not technically difficult but carries the potential complication of inducing a stroke. A stroke can occur during surgery or after the procedure. The chance of a stroke ranges from 1–4 percent.<ref>[http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec06/ch086/ch086b.html?qt=tia Transient Ischemic Attacks(TIA)] Merck, Sharpe & Dohme. Retrieved on 2010-03-07</ref>

Some patients may also be given modified-release dipyridamole or clopidogrel.

=== Medication ===
The use of [[anti-coagulant]] medications, [[heparin]] and [[warfarin]], or anti-[[platelet]] medications such as [[aspirin]] may be warranted. [[Antiplatelet drug]]s prevent platelets from agglutinating or sticking to each other, hence the term "blood thinner." The initial treatment is [[aspirin]], second line is [[clopidogrel]] (PLAVIX), third line is [[ticlopidine]].  If TIA is recurrent after aspirin treatment, the combination of [[aspirin]] and [[dipyridamole]] is needed (Aggrenox).

Thinning the blood helps to ensure that small particles do not form and travel to the brain. These drugs require frequent monitoring. These drugs also have side effects such as easy bruising and bleeding from mild trauma.<ref>[http://www.brainstroke.net/ Brain Stroke Overview] Retrieved on 2010-03-07</ref>

An [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) may show [[atrial fibrillation]], a common cause of TIAs, or other [[arrhythmia]]s that may cause [[embolisation]] to the brain. An [[echocardiogram]] is useful in detecting [[thrombus]] within the heart chambers. Such patients benefit from [[anticoagulation]].

== Prognosis ==
People diagnosed with a TIA are sometimes said to have had a warning for an approaching [[stroke]]. If the time period of blood supply impairment lasts more than a few minutes, the nerve cells of that area of the brain die and cause permanent neurologic damage. One third of the people with TIA later have recurrent TIAs and one third have a stroke because of permanent nerve cell loss.  Other sources cite that 10% of TIAs will develop stroke within 90 days, half of which will occur in the first two days following the TIA.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}
The risk of a stroke occurring after a TIA can be predicted using the [[ABCD² score]].
