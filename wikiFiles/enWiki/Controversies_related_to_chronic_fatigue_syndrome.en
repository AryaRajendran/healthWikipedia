'''[[Chronic fatigue syndrome]]''' (CFS) is an illness with a long history of controversies.

The diagnosis is controversial, and its [[etiology]] is still not fully understood. [[Alternative names for chronic fatigue syndrome|Alternative names]] to describe the condition(s) have been used over time throughout the world, and the name chronic fatigue syndrome is criticized by many patient groups that say the name trivializes the illness. They prefer a more serious-sounding term, such as [[myalgic encephalomyelitis]].

A major divide still exists over funding for research and treatment of [[physiology|physiological]] versus [[psychology|psychological]] and [[psychosocial]] aspects of the illness. The division is especially great between CFS patient groups and health care professionals advocating psychological and psychosocial treatments in the United Kingdom.<ref name = "pmid11037362">{{cite journal | author=Couper J | title = Chronic fatigue syndrome and Australian psychiatry: lessons from the UK experience | journal=[[Aust N Z J Psychiatry]] | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 762–9 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11037362 | doi = 10.1046/j.1440-1614.2000.00810.x }}</ref>

==Naming==
{{main | Alternative names for chronic fatigue syndrome}}
An article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' states many patients would prefer a different name than chronic fatigue syndrome, saying that "fatigue" does not adequately describe their condition, and believe the name chronic fatigue syndrome trivializes the illness, preventing it from being seen as a serious health problem, and discouraging research. Their preference is an older British term, myalgic encephalomyelitis, or the term, myalgic encephalopathy.<ref name = cfsyuppie>{{cite news |work=The New York Times | last = Tuller | first = D | title = Chronic Fatigue Syndrome No Longer Seen as ‘Yuppie Flu’ | date = 17 July 2007 | accessdate =15 June 2009 | url = http://health.nytimes.com/ref/health/healthguide/esn-chronicfatigue-ess.html }}</ref> According to a survey of medical trainees at a school in the United States, a condition described as chronic fatigue syndrome may be considered less serious than a condition described as myalgic encephalopathy.<ref name = "pmid11928774">{{cite journal | author=Jason LA, Taylor RR, Plioplys S, Stepanek Z, Shlaes J | title = Evaluating attributions for an illness based upon the name: chronic fatigue syndrome, myalgic encephalopathy and Florence Nightingale disease | journal=Am J Community Psychol | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 133–48 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11928774 | doi = 10.1023/A:1014328319297}}</ref> In 2004, a paper reported that the majority of the CFS patients questioned in a survey wanted the name changed from chronic fatigue syndrome.<ref>{{ cite journal | last = Jason | first = L | coauthors = Holbert C; Torres-Harding S; Taylor RR | year = 2004 | title = Stigma and the Term Chronic Fatigue Syndrome | journal=Journal of Disability Policy Studies | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 222–228 | doi = 10.1177/10442073040140040401}}</ref>

===Recognition===
Historically, many professionals within the medical community were unfamiliar with CFS, or did they not recognize it as a real condition, and disagreed on its prevalence or seriousness.<ref name = "pmid1794092"/><ref name = "pmid9231495" /><ref>{{cite journal | author=Jason LA, Richman JA, Friedberg F, Wagner L, Taylor R, Jordan KM | title = Politics, science, and the emergence of a new disease.

===Contrasting viewpoints===
There has been much disagreement over proposed cause(s), diagnosis, and treatment of the illness.<ref name = "pmid8856816">{{cite journal | author=Sharpe M | title = Chronic fatigue syndrome | journal=Psychiatr.

In a letter to the Lancet in 1993, psychiatrists David and [[Simon Wessely|Wessely]] contested the WHO classification of CFS under diseases of the nervous system, arguing that it was a form of [[neurasthenia]] to be classified as a psychiatric condition.<ref>{{cite journal | author=David A, Wessely S | title = Chronic fatigue, ME, and ICD-10 | journal=[[The Lancet]] | volume = 342 | issue = 8881 | pages = 1247–8 | year = 1993 | pmid = 7901572 | doi = 10.1016/0140-6736(93)92234-K}}</ref> Dutch researchers authored a 1998 study that developed and tested a model where behavioral, cognitive, and affective factors played a role in perpetuating fatigue, and concluded that this was the correct model for CFS.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Vercoulen | first = JHMM | coauthors = Swanink CMA; Galama JMD; Fennis JFM; Jongen PHJ; Hommes OR; Van der Meer JWM; Bleijenberg G | year = 1998 | title = The persistence of fatigue in chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple sclerosis: Development of a model | pmid = 9859853 | issue = 6| journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research | volume = 45 | pages = 507–517 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-3999(98)00023-3}}</ref> After an attempted replication of the Dutch model with a 2005 population-based study, United States researchers stated the model adequately represented chronic fatigue secondary to psychiatric conditions, but not CFS.

Contested causation may have serious negative effects on healthcare for individuals, as it may erode patient-provider trust, test the provider's self-assurance and capacity to share power with the patient, and raise problematic issues of reparation, compensation and blame.<ref name = "pmid12194900">{{cite journal | author=Engel CC, Adkins JA, Cowan DN | title = Caring for medically unexplained physical symptoms after toxic environmental exposures: effects of contested causation | journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives|Environ.

A survey published in 2013 found that 89% of patient organisations thought the illness to be physical, compared with 58% of newspaper articles and 24% of medical authorities. The authors of the report think that this might explain the gulf between patients and doctors, and why many patients are reluctant to engage in behavioural treatments.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1258/shorts.2012.012051}}</ref>

===PACE trial===
PACE was a large trial investigating the efficacy and safety of four treatments adjunctive to specialist medical care (SMC): cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), graded exercise therapy (GET), and adaptive pacing therapy (APT). The results were published in February 2011 and concluded that CBT and GET were each "moderately" effective compared to SMC alone, while APT was not found to be effective when added to SMC.<ref>{{cite pmid|21334061}}</ref>

The trial generated a furious response from patient groups and campaigners. [[Letter to the editor|Letters to the editor]] critiqued the definitions of secondary outcomes, questioned post-hoc protocol changes, and expressed concern over generalisability of the results. Professor Malcolm Hooper branded the results "unethical and unscientific" and submitted a 442 page response to the Medical Research Council and a shorter 43-page complaint to the Lancet. The MRC and the Lancet have considered the submissions and rejected them. A Lancet editorial conjectured that the strong negative response might be due to the dismay over the debilitating illness, "but also from an active campaign to discredit the research."<ref name="PMID 21592553">{{cite journal | author=[No authors listed] (Editorial) | title = Patients' power and PACE | journal=Lancet | volume = 377 | issue = 9780 | pages = 1808 | year = 2011 | month = May | pmid = 21592553 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60696-X | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2811%2960696-X/fulltext}}</ref><ref name="PMID 21697226">{{cite journal | author=Hawkes N | title = (Editorial) Dangers of research into chronic fatigue syndrome | journal=BMJ | volume = 342 | pages = d3780 | year = 2011 | month = June | pmid = 21697226 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.d3780 | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d3780.extract}}</ref>

==Support for patients==
A 2006 investigation by a group from the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] found there was not enough support in the UK for CFS patients in terms of access to social security and health care.<ref name = "pmid16935965">{{cite journal |author=Gibson I |title=A new look at chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis |journal=J.

In 1998 it became known almost 13 million dollars for CFS research had been redirected or improperly accounted for by the United States CDC.

In an article in the ''Journal of Clinical Pathology'', [[Malcolm Hooper]] argued myalgic encephalomyelitis should be used in place of CFS, and that research in the UK has been hijacked by a "lobby of psychologists and psychiatrists" holding significant power within the medical fraternity, with a resultant "gross abuse/neglect of patients."<ref name="hooper_pathol_06"/>

In her 1997 book ''Hystories: Hysterical Epidemics and Modern Culture,'' literary critic and feminist [[Elaine Showalter]] argues that chronic fatigue syndrome is a "hysterical narrative," a modern manifestation of [[hysteria]], a self-perpetuating "cultural symptom of anxiety and stress" historically assigned to women.<ref name="showalter">{{cite book | author=Showalter, Elaine | title = Hystories: hysterical epidemics and modern media | publisher=Columbia University Press | location = New York | year = 1997 | pages = [http://books.google.com/books?id=lTL34npiiV0C&pg=PA115 132] | isbn = 0-231-10459-6 | oclc = }}</ref> She says that CFS is a new form of "[[effort syndrome]]", a disorder with a long history. Showalter says the media, especially the internet, help to spread the mass hysteria and doctors bow to pressure to accept the new diagnosis because they do not want to be seen as "uncaring." In her book she says that CFS symptoms are genuine, whether psychologically or organically caused, or both, and that the main problem is that people do not believe that psychiatric disorders are "real". She says that while many CFS patients are hostile to psychiatric explanations for their illness, "the majority of doctors and researchers maintain that CFS is a psychological syndrome, and that its symptoms and effects are real".<ref name="showalter" /><ref>[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-05-28/features/1997148148_1_elaine-showalter-hystories-chronic-fatigue-syndrome Rewriting Modern 'Hystories' Elaine Showalter believes that Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Gulf War Syndrome and other current maladies are not significantly different from the Salem witch hysteria or the spurt in reports of alien abductions] - The Baltimore Sun, 28 May 1997</ref> In 2001 she wrote in a new preface to a reprint of her book that CFS patients responded to her ideas with hate mail and death threats.

The 2006 report by the UK Parliamentary Group on Scientific Research into Myalgic Encephalomyelitis stated that, "CFS/ME is defined as a psychosocial illness by the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] (DWP) and medical insurance companies. Therefore claimants are not entitled to the higher level of benefit payments. We recognise that if CFS/ME remains as one illness and/or both remain defined as psychosocial then it would be in the financial interest of both the DWP and the medical insurance companies." The Group called for investigation of what they called, "numerous cases where advisors to the DWP have also had consultancy roles in medical insurance companies. Particularly the Company [[Unum|UNUMProvident]]. Given the vested interest private medical insurance companies have in ensuring CFS/ME remain classified as a psychosocial illness there is blatant conflict of interest here." The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions responded that "Entitlement to Disability Living Allowance depends on the effects that severe physical or mental disability has on a person's need for personal care and/or their ability to walk, and not on particular disabilities or diagnoses. The
benefit is available to people with myalgic encephalomyelitis (which can have a physical basis or a psychological basis, or can be due to a combination of factors) on exactly the same terms as other severely disabled people, and they can qualify for it provided that they meet the usual entitlement conditions."<ref>{{cite web | publisher=United Kingdom Parliamentry Group on Scientific Research into Myalgic Encephalomyelitis | title = Inquiry into the status of CFS/ME and research into causes and treatment | date = 1 November 2006 | url = http://erythos.com/gibsonenquiry/Report.html | accessdate =25 June 2010 }}</ref>
