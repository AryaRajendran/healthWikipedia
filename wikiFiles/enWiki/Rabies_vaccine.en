'''Rabies vaccine''' is a [[vaccine]] used to control [[rabies]]. Rabies can be prevented by [[vaccination]], both in humans and other animals.

==In animals==
Currently, pre-exposure [[immunization]] has been used on domesticated and normal non-human populations. In many jurisdictions, domestic dogs, cats, ferrets, and rabbits are required to be vaccinated.

'''Imrab''' is an example of a veterinary rabies vaccine containing the Pasteur strain of killed rabies virus. Several different types of Imrab exist, including Imrab, Imrab 3, and Imrab Large Animal. Imrab 3 has been approved for [[ferret]]s and, in some areas, [[pet skunk]]s.<ref>[http://us.merial.com/equine/products/equine_imrab3.asp Merial]</ref><ref>[http://www.aspenskunk.org/canadastudy.htm Aspen Skunk Rabies Research, Inc.]</ref>

==History==
Virtually every infection with rabies resulted in death until two French scientists, [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Emile Roux]], developed the first rabies vaccination in 1885. This vaccine was first used on a human on July 6, 1885, on nine-year-old [[Joseph Meister]] (1876–1940), who had been mauled by a rabid dog.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3560403 |author=Geison GL |title=Pasteur's work on rabies: Reexamining the ethical issues diagnosis for developing countries |journal=Hastings Center Report |issue=April |pages=26- |year=1978  |jstor=3560403 |volume=8 |publisher=The Hastings Center |pmid=348641}}</ref>

Their vaccine consisted of a sample of the virus harvested from infected (and necessarily dead) rabbits, which was weakened by allowing it to dry for 5 to 10 days. Similar nerve tissue-derived vaccines are still used now in some countries, and while they are much cheaper than modern cell culture vaccines, they are not as effective.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Neural tissue vaccines also carry a certain risk of neurological complications.<ref name="pmid15069272">{{cite journal |author=Srivastava AK, Sardana V, Prasad K, Behari M |title=Diagnostic dilemma in flaccid paralysis following anti-rabies vaccine |journal=Neurol India |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=132–3 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15069272 |doi= |url=http://www.neurologyindia.com/article.asp?issn=0028-3886;year=2004;volume=52;issue=1;spage=132;epage=133;aulast=Srivastava}}</ref>

==Modern vaccines==
The human [[diploid]] cell rabies vaccine (H.D.C.V.) was started in 1967. Human diploid cell rabies vaccines are [[inactivated vaccine]]s made using the attenuated Pitman-Moore L503 strain of the virus.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rabies - Human Vaccines|url=http://www.who.int/rabies/vaccines/human_vaccines/en/index.html|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref> Human diploid cell rabies vaccines have been given to more than 1.5 million people as of 2006. 

Aside from vaccinating humans, another approach was also developed by vaccinating dogs to prevent the spread of the virus. In 1979 the Van Houweling Research Laboratory of the [[Silliman University]] Medical Center in the [[Philippines]], then headed by Dr. George Beran,<ref>[http://www.worldrabiesday.org/EN/Media_Center/Perspectives.html "Dr. George W. Beran's Biography"]. World Rabies Day. Retrieved 2010-04-23.</ref> developed and produced a dog vaccine that gave a three-year immunity from [[rabies]]. The development of the vaccine resulted in the elimination of rabies in many parts of the [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]] Islands. The successful program in the Philippines was later used as a model by other countries, such as [[Ecuador]] and the [[Yucatan|Yucatan State]] of [[Mexico]], in their fight against rabies conducted in collaboration with the [[World Health Organization]].<ref>[http://www.onehealthinitiative.com/publications/RabiesPresentationWithNotes1.pdf "One World, One Health Rabies"].OneHealthInitiative.com. Retrieved 2010-04-23.</ref>

In addition to these developments, newer and less expensive purified chicken embryo cell vaccine, and purified [[Vero cell]] rabies vaccine are now available. The purified Vero cell rabies vaccine uses the attenuated Wistar strain of the rabies virus, and uses the Vero cell line as its host.

==Recombinant rabies vaccine (V-RG)==
[[Image:Rabies vaccine in bait.jpg|thumb|Aerially distributed wildlife rabies vaccine in a bait from Estonia.]]
In 1984 researchers at the [[Wistar Institute]] developed a [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] vaccine called V-RG by inserting the [[glycoprotein]] gene from rabies into a [[vaccinia]] virus.<ref name="Wiktor_1984">{{cite journal |author=Wiktor TJ, Macfarlan RI, Reagan KJ, Dietzschold B, Curtis PJ, Wunner WH, Kieny MP, Lathe R, Lecocq JP, Mackett M |title=Protection from rabies by a vaccinia virus recombinant containing the rabies virus glycoprotein gene |journal=Proc.

U.S.A. |volume=81 |issue=22 |pages=7194–8 |year=1984 |pmid=6095272 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.81.22.7194 |pmc=392104}}</ref> The V-RG vaccine has since been commercialised by [[Merial]] under the trademark Raboral.<ref>[http://www.raboral.com/ Raboral]</ref> It is harmless to humans and has been shown to be safe for various species of animals that might accidentally encounter it in the wild, including birds (gulls, hawks, and owls).<ref name="Artois_1990">{{cite journal |author=Artois M, Charlton KM, Tolson ND, Casey GA, Knowles MK, Campbell JB |title=Vaccinia recombinant virus expressing the rabies virus glycoprotein: safety and efficacy trials in Canadian wildlife |journal=Can. J. Vet. Res. |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=504–7 |year=1990 |pmid=2249183 |pmc=1255701}}</ref>

V-RG has been successfully used in the field in [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States]] to prevent outbreaks of rabies in [[wildlife]]. The vaccine is stable under relatively high temperatures and can be delivered orally, making mass vaccination of wildlife possible by putting it in baits. The plan for immunization of normal populations involves dropping bait containing food wrapped around a small dose of the live virus{{clarify|date=November 2012}}. The bait would be dropped by helicopter concentrating on areas that have not been infected yet. Such a strategy of oral immunization of foxes in Europe has already achieved substantial reductions in the incidence of human rabies. In November 2008, Germany had been free of new cases for two years and is therefore currently believed to be rabies-free, together with few other countries. A strategy of vaccinating “neighborhood dogs” in [[Jaipur]], [[India]], combined with a sterilization program, has also resulted in a large reduction in the number of human cases.<ref name="Reece_2006">{{cite journal | author=Reece JF, Chawla SK. | title=Control of rabies in Jaipur, India, by the sterilisation and vaccination of neighbourhood dogs. | journal=Vet Rec | year=2006 | volume=159 | pages=379–83 | pmid=16980523 | issue=12 | doi=10.1136/vr.159.12.379}}</ref>

== Duration of immunity ==
The duration of immunity afforded to humans by a two injection vaccination course was found to be between two to three years.<ref>[http://www.spmsd.co.uk/file.asp?docid=140 Patient Group Direction Information for Rabies Vaccine BP (Sanofi Pasteur MSD)], page 3</ref><ref>[http://www.travelturtle.co.uk/Vaccine_Details.aspx?confoundingFactorId=61 Travelturtle.co.uk health guide]</ref><ref>[http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/ccdr-rmtc/02vol28/28sup/acs4.html An Advisory Committee Statement (ACS) Committee to Advise on Tropical Medicine and Travel (CATMAT) STATEMENT ON TRAVELLERS AND RABIES VACCINE]</ref>  Following administration of a booster dose (recommended at one year), one study found 97% of immuno-competent individuals demonstrate protective levels of neutralizing antibodies at 10 years.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071116023105/http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/ccdr-rmtc/02vol28/28sup/acs4.html STATEMENT ON TRAVELLERS AND RABIES VACCINE]</ref>
