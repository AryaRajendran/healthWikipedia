|quote=Having successfully battled cancer four times, the 75-year-old was 12 months ago diagnosed with inoperable tumours to both lungs. A cocktail of chemotherapy and drugs is currently controlling this latest bout of the disease. But Sir Bobby candidly admits it is a matter of when rather than if...In 1992 he overcame bowel cancer, the same disease that claimed the life of World Cup winner Bobby Moore. Then three years later he was diagnosed with an extremely rare and deadly form of malignant melanoma after his wife, Elsie, forced him to see his doctor about an ongoing sinus problem....In a complicated operation surgeons removed the tumour, leaving a hole in the roof of his mouth which he has to fill with a rubber plug...The melanoma may have been removed but its effects have come back to haunt Sir Bobby. Rogue cells found their way into his lungs and his brain. In May 2006 he had a tumour the size of a golf ball removed from his right lung after a routine X-ray of his ribs following a skiing accident picked up a shadow...Three months later Sir Bobby was again back in hospital after being taken ill at an Ipswich Town home game...was admitted to the [Newcastle] General Hospital where a grape-sized growth was cut out. At the same time he suffered a haemorrhage of the brain, similar to a stroke. Paralysed down the left side, it was assumed Sir Bobby would never walk again. But he has got himself back on his feet, although he has been left partially paralysed...Now regularly attending for scans, in February 2007 nodules were found in both his lungs. "Unfortunately, these are inoperable. I'm on chemotherapy to control their growth, and it seems to be working at the moment. Hopefully they will remain docile."

"She told me she needed to raise some money for a good cause. I said, ‘What is it?’ She said, ‘To kit out a cancer research centre we are moving to next October.’ Ruth explained the unit was already there, that the NHS was going to pay for its running, but that there wasn’t a penny to kit it out. The task of raising the money had been left to Ruth and her colleague Professor Hilary Calvert. I was appalled. How could two people with responsible, full-time jobs find the time to raise that sort of money? Ruth asked me if I knew anyone who would be willing to contribute. I had a chat with one or two people and out of that the foundation has been born...I couldn’t not respond to Ruth’s request"..."I have the time now because I’m not 100% involved with professional football to do something gracious and commendable for other people and for the North East."
