'''1,4-Dioxin''' (also referred as '''dioxin''' or '''''p''-dioxin''') is a [[heterocyclic compound|heterocyclic]], [[Organic compound|organic]], [[Antiaromaticity|antiaromatic]] [[chemical compound|compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. There is an [[isomer]]ic form of 1,4-dioxin, [[1,2-dioxin]] (or ''o''-dioxin). 1,2-Dioxin is very unstable due to its [[peroxide]]-like characteristics.

The term “dioxin” is most commonly used for a family of derivatives of dioxin, known as [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins]] (PCDDs).

== Preparation ==
1,4-Dioxin can be prepared by [[cycloaddition]], namely by the [[Diels–Alder reaction]] of [[furan]] and [[maleic anhydride]]. The [[adduct]] formed has a carbon-carbon double bond, which is [[Epoxide#Olefin peroxidation|converted to an epoxide]]. The epoxide then undergoes a [[retro-Diels–Alder reaction]], forming 1,4-dioxin and regenerating maleic anhydride.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1039/p19940000927 | journal = J. Chem.

The word “dioxin” can refer in a general way to compounds which have a dioxin core skeletal structure with [[substituent]] molecular groups attached to it. For example, [[dibenzo-1,4-dioxin]] is a compound whose structure consists of two benzo- groups fused onto a 1,4-dioxin ring.  

=== Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins ===
{{Main|polychlorinated dibenzodioxins}}
Because of their extreme importance as environmental pollutants, current scientific literature uses the name '''dioxins''' commonly for simplification to denote the chlorinated derivatives of dibenzo-1,4-dioxin, more precisely the [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins]] (PCDDs), among which [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin]] (TCDD), a tetrachlorinated derivative, is the best known. The polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, which can also be classified in the family of [[Halocarbon|halogenated organic compounds]], have been shown to [[bioaccumulate]] in humans and [[wildlife]] due to their [[lipophilic]] properties, and are known [[teratogens]], [[mutagens]], and [[carcinogens]]. 

PCDDs are formed through [[combustion]], [[chlorine]] bleaching and [[manufacturing]] processes.<ref name="mgov">[http://maine.gov/dep/dioxin/ Dioxin] from [http://maine.gov/dep/index.shtml State of Maine's Department of Environmental Protection]</ref> The combination of heat and chlorine creates dioxin.<ref name="mgov"/> Since chlorine is often a part of the Earth's [[natural environment|environment]], natural ecological activity such as volcanic activity and forest fires can lead to the formation of PCDDs.<ref name="mgov"/> Nevertheless, PCDDs are mostly produced by human activity.<ref name="mgov"/>

Famous PCDD exposure cases include [[Agent Orange]] produced by [[Monsanto]] sprayed over vegetation during the Vietnam war, the [[Seveso disaster]], and the poisoning of [[Viktor Yushchenko]].

[[Polychlorinated dibenzofurans]] are a related class compounds to PCDDs which are often included within the general term “dioxins”.
