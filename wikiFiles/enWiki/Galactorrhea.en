'''Galactorrhea''' or '''galactorrhea''' is the spontaneous flow of [[milk]] from the [[breast]], unassociated with [[childbirth]] or nursing.

Galactorrhea is reported to occur in 5%-32% percent of women, much of the difference in reported incidence can be attributed to different definitions of galactorrhea. <ref name=Sakiyama_1983>{{cite pmid|6361641}}</ref> Galactorrhea also occurs in males, newborn infants and adolescents of both sexes. <ref name=Rohn_1984>{{cite pmid|6420385 }}</ref>

Although frequently benign, it may be caused by serious underlying conditions and should be properly investigated.<ref>{{cite pmid|10887453}}</ref>

==Causes==
It can be due to dysregulation of certain [[hormone]]s or local causes such as excessive nipple stimulation. Hormonal causes most frequently associated with galactorrhea are [[hyperprolactinemia]] and [[thyroid]] conditions with elevated levels of [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] or [[TRH]] hormones. No obvious cause is found in about 50% of cases. <ref name=Sakiyama_1983/>

[[Lactation]] requires the presence of [[estrogen]], [[progesterone]] and [[prolactin]], and the evaluation of galactorrhea includes eliciting a history for various medications or foods ([[methyldopa]], [[opiates]],  [[antipsychotic]]s, [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s, as well as [[licorice]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}) and for behavioral causes (stress, and breast and chest wall stimulation), as well as evaluation for pregnancy, [[pituitary adenoma]]s (with overproduction of [[prolactin]] or compression of the pituitary stalk), and [[hypothyroidism]]. Adenomas of the anterior pituitary are most often prolactinomas. Overproduction of prolactin leads to cessation of menstrual periods and [[infertility]], which may be a diagnostic clue. Galactorrhea may also be caused by hormonal imbalances owing to birth control pills.

Galactorrhea is also a side effect associated with the use of the second-generation [[H2 receptor antagonist]] [[Cimetidine]] (trade name: Tagamet). Galactorrhea can also be caused by anti-psychotics that cause hyperprolactinemia by blocking dopamine receptors responsible for control of prolactin release. Of these, [[risperidone]] is the most notorious for causing this complication. Case reports suggest [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s have been shown to cause Galactorrhea.

==Neonatal Milk==
{{main|witch's milk}}
'''Neonatal milk''' or '''witch's milk''' is [[milk]] secreted from the [[breast]]s of many [[newborn infant]]s. It is considered a normal variation and no treatment or testing is necessary. In folklore, witch's milk was believed to be a source of nourishment for witches' [[familiar spirit]]s.<ref>{{cite book | first=Malcolm  | last= Potts | authorlink= Malcolm Potts | year=1999 | title=Ever Since Adam and Eve: The Evolution of Human Sexuality | isbn=0-521-64404-6 | page= 145}}</ref>
