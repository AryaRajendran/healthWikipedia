'''Hyperprolactinaemia''' or '''hyperprolactinemia''' ('''HP''') is the presence of abnormally high levels of [[prolactin]] in the blood. [[Reference ranges for common blood tests|Normal levels]] are less than 500 mIU/L for women, and less than 450 mIU/L for men.

Prolactin is a [[peptide hormone]] produced by the anterior [[pituitary gland]] primarily associated with [[lactation]] and plays a vital role in breast development during [[pregnancy]]. Hyperprolactinaemia may cause production and spontaneous flow of breast milk  and disruptions in the normal [[menstrual period]] in women and [[hypogonadism]], [[infertility]] and [[erectile dysfunction]] in men.

Hyperprolactinaemia can be a part of normal body changes during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It can also be caused by diseases affecting the [[hypothalamus]] and pituitary gland. It can also be caused by disruption of the normal regulation of prolactin levels by drugs, medicinal herbs and heavy metals. Hyperprolactinaemia may also be the result of disease of other organs such as the liver, kidneys, ovaries and thyroid.<ref name=Mancini2008>{{Cite journal  | author = Mancini, T.

== Causes ==

Hyperprolactinaemia may be caused by either disinhibition (e.g., compression of the pituitary stalk or reduced dopamine levels) or excess production from a [[prolactinoma]] (a pituitary gland [[adenoma]] tumour). A blood serum prolactin level of 1000–5000 mIU/L could be from either mechanism, but >5000 mIU/L is likely due to the activity of an adenoma with macroadenomas (large tumours over 10&nbsp;mm diameter) whose levels of prolactin are up to 100,000 mIU/L. Hyperprolactinaemia inhibits [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) by increasing the release of [[dopamine]] from the [[arcuate nucleus]] of the [[hypothalamus]] (dopamine inhibits GnRH secretion), thus inhibiting gonadal steroidogenesis, which is the cause of many of the symptoms described below. [source?]

=== Physiological causes ===

Physiological (i.e., non-[[pathological]]) causes include: [[pregnancy]], [[breastfeeding]], and [[stress (medicine)|mental stress]].

Prolactin secretion in the pituitary is normally suppressed by the brain chemical [[dopamine]]. Drugs that block the effects of dopamine at the pituitary or deplete dopamine stores in the brain may cause the pituitary to secrete prolactin. These drugs include the major [[sedative|tranquillizers]] ([[phenothiazine]]s), [[trifluoperazine]] (Stelazine), and [[haloperidol]] (Haldol);  [[antipsychotic]] medications in general; [[metoclopramide]] (Reglan), [[domperidone]], [[cisapride]] used to treat [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|gastro-oesophageal reflux]] and medication-induced nausea(such as cancer drugs); and, less often, [[methyldopa|alpha-methyldopa]] and [[reserpine]], used to control [[hypertension]]; and [[Estrogen|estrogens]] and [[thyrotropin-releasing hormone|TRH]]. The sleep drug [[ramelteon]] (Rozerem) also increases the risk of hyperprolactinaemia. In particular, the dopamine antagonists metoclopramide and domperidone are both powerful prolactin stimulators and have been used to stimulate breastmilk secretion for decades. However since prolactin is antagonized by dopamine and the body depends on the two being in balance, the risk of prolactin stimulation is generally present with all drugs that deplete dopamine, either directly or as a rebound effect.
Risperidone can also cause hyperprolactinaemia.

=== Diseases ===

Prolactinoma or other tumours arising in or near the pituitary — such as those that cause [[acromegaly]] or [[Cushing's disease]] — may block the flow of dopamine from the brain to the prolactin-secreting cells, likewise, division of the [[pituitary stalk]] or hypothalamic disease.  Other causes include [[chronic renal failure]], [[hypothyroidism]], [[bronchogenic carcinoma]] and [[sarcoidosis]]. Some women with [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] may have mildly-elevated prolactin levels.

Apart from diagnosing hyperprolactinaemia and [[hypopituitarism]], prolactin levels are often checked by physicians in patients that have suffered a [[seizure]], when there is doubt as to whether they have had an [[epileptic seizure]] or a [[non-epileptic seizure]].  Shortly after epileptic seizures, prolactin levels often rise, whereas they are normal in non-epileptic seizures.

=== Idiopathic ===

In many patients, elevated levels remain unexplained and may represent a form of hypothalamic-pituitary dysregulation.

== Symptoms ==

In women, a high blood level of prolactin often causes [[hypoestrogenism|hypo-oestrogenism]] with anovulatory [[infertility]] and a decrease in [[menstruation]]. In some women, menstruation may disappear altogether ([[amenorrhoea]]).  In others, menstruation may become irregular or menstrual flow may change.  Women who are not pregnant or nursing may begin producing [[breast milk]].  Some women may experience a loss of [[libido]] (interest in sex) and breast pain, especially when prolactin levels begin to rise for the first time, as the hormone promotes tissue changes in the breast.  [[Sexual intercourse|Intercourse]] may become painful because of vaginal dryness.

In men, the most common symptoms of hyperprolactinaemia are decreased [[libido]], [[erectile dysfunction]], [[infertility]] and [[Gynecomastia|gynaecomastia]]. Because men have no reliable indicator such as [[menstruation]] to signal a problem, many men with hyperprolactinaemia being caused by an adenoma may delay going to the doctor until they have [[headaches]] or eye problems caused by the enlarged pituitary pressing against the adjacent [[optic chiasm]]. They may not recognize a gradual loss of sexual function or [[libido]]. Only after treatment do some men realize they had a problem with sexual function. 

Because of hypoestrogenism and hypogonadism (low testosterone), hyperprolactinaemia can lead to  [[osteoporosis]].

== Diagnosis ==

A doctor will test for prolactin blood levels in women with unexplained milk secretion ([[galactorrhea|galactorrhoea]]) or irregular [[menses]] or [[infertility]], and in men with impaired sexual function and milk secretion. If prolactin is high, a doctor will test [[thyroid]] function and ask first about other conditions and medications known to raise prolactin secretion. While a plain [[X-ray]] of the bones surrounding the pituitary may reveal the presence of a large macro-adenoma, the small micro-adenoma will not be apparent. Magnetic resonance imaging ([[MRI]]) is the most sensitive test for detecting pituitary tumours and determining their size. [[MRI]] scans may be repeated periodically to assess tumour progression and the effects of therapy. [[Computed Tomography]] (CT scan) also gives an image of the pituitary, but it is less sensitive than the MRI.

In addition to assessing the size of the pituitary tumour, doctors also look for damage to surrounding tissues, and perform tests to assess whether production of other pituitary hormones is normal. Depending on the size of the tumour, the doctor may request an eye exam with measurement of visual fields.

The hormone prolactin is downregulated by [[dopamine]] and is upregulated by [[estrogen|oestrogen]].  A falsely-high measurement may occur due to the presence of the biologically-inactive [[macroprolactin]] in the serum. This can show up as high prolactin in some types of tests, but is asymptomatic.

== Treatment ==

Treatment is usually medication with [[dopamine agonist]]s such as [[cabergoline]],<ref name="pmid10404830">{{cite journal |author=Verhelst J, Abs R, Maiter D, ''et al.'' |title=Cabergoline in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia: a study in 455 patients |journal=J.
