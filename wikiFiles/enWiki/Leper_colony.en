A '''leper colony''', '''leprosarium''', or '''lazar house''' is a place to [[quarantine]] people with [[leprosy]]. The term [[Lazaretto]] can refer to quarantine sites, which were at some time also leper colonies.

==History==

Leper colonies or houses became widespread in the [[Middle Ages]], particularly in Europe and India, and often run by monastic orders. Historically, [[leprosy]] has been greatly feared because it causes visible disfigurement and disability, was incurable, and was commonly believed to be highly contagious. A leper colony administered by a Roman Catholic order was often called a lazar house, after [[Lazarus and Dives|Lazarus]], the patron saint of lepers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://saints.sqpn.com/saintl41.htm | title=Patron Saints Index: Saint Lazarus}}</ref>

Some colonies were located on mountains or in remote locations in order to ensure quarantine, some on main roads, where donations would be made for their upkeep. Debate exists over the conditions found within historical leper colonies; while they are currently thought to have been grim and neglected places, there are some indications that life within a leper colony or house was no worse than the life of other, non-quarantined individuals. There is even doubt that the current definition of leprosy can be retrospectively applied to the medieval condition. What was classified as leprosy then covers a wide range of skin conditions that would be classified as distinct afflictions today.<ref>http://www.leprosy.org/getinformed/aboutleprosy/basics.php</ref>

Some leper colonies issued their own [[money]] (such as tokens), in the belief that allowing lepers to handle regular money could spread the disease.<ref>Unique experiment with currency notes(1970) Isaac Teoh, The Star, Januaryâ€“February, p7.</ref><ref>The numismatic aspects of leprosy(1993), McFadden, RR, Grost J, Marr DF. p.21 D.C.McDonald Associates, Inc.

== Political aspects ==
In 2001, government-run [[Leprosy in Japan|leper colonies in Japan]] came under judicial scrutiny, leading to the determination that the Japanese government had mistreated the patients, and the District Court ordered Japan to pay [[damages|compensation]] to former patients.<ref name = BBC_2001>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1350630.stm | title = Koizumi apologises for leper colonies | work = BBC News |date = 2001-05-25 | accessdate=2007-03-20 }}</ref> In 2002, a formal inquiry into these colonies was set up, and in March 2005 the policy was strongly denounced.  "Japan's policy of absolute quarantine... did not have any scientific grounds."<ref name=BBC_2005>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4311679.stm | title = Japan's leprosy policy denounced | work = BBC News | date = 2005-03-02 | accessdate=2007-03-20 }}</ref> The inquiry denounced not only the government and the doctors that are involved with the policy but also the court that repeatedly ruled in the favor of the government when the policy was challenged, as well as the media, which failed to report the plight of the victims.
