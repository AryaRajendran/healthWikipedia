The potential impact of thiomersal on autism has been investigated extensively. Multiple lines of scientific evidence have shown that thiomersal does not cause autism.

This controversy has caused harm due to parents attempting to treat their autistic children with unproven and possibly dangerous treatments, discouraging parents from vaccinating their children due to fears about thiomersal toxicity<ref name=Harris/> and diverting resources away from research into more promising areas for the [[cause of autism]].<ref name=Luscombe/> Thousands of lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. to seek damages from alleged toxicity from vaccines, including those purportedly caused by thiomersal.<ref name=Sugarman/> US courts have ruled against multiple representative test cases involving thiomersal,<ref name=Maugh/> suggesting the majority are unlikely to succeed.<ref name=Vedantam/>

==History==
Thiomersal was introduced as a preservative in the 1930s to prevent the growth of infectious organisms such as bacteria and fungi, and has been in use in vaccines and other products such as [[antibody|immunoglobulin]] preparations and ophthalmic and nasal solutions. Vaccine manufacturers have used preservatives to prevent microbial growth during the manufacturing process or when packaged as "multi-dose" products to allow for multiple punctures of the same vial to dispense multiple vaccinations with less fear of contamination.<ref name=T-in-vaccines/> After the [[Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997|FDA Modernization Act of 1997]] mandated a review and risk assessment of all mercury-containing food and drugs, vaccine manufacturers responded to FDA requests made in December 1998 and April 1999 to provide detailed information about the thiomersal content of their preparations.<ref name="AAP">{{cite web|author=American Academy of Pediatrics| authorlink=American Academy of Pediatrics|date=1999-09-01|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/104/3/568| title=Joint Statement of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the US Public Health Service (USPHS)|accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref>

A review of the data showed that while the [[vaccine schedule]] for infants did not exceed FDA, [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] (ATSDR), or WHO guidelines on mercury exposure, it could have exceeded [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) standards for the first six months of life, depending on the vaccine formulation and the weight of the infant.<ref name=T-in-vaccines/> The review also highlighted difficulty interpreting toxicity of the [[ethylmercury]] in thiomersal because guidelines for mercury toxicity were based primarily on studies of [[methylmercury]], a different mercury compound with different toxicologic properties.<ref name=Ball>{{cite journal|author=Ball LK, Ball R, Pratt RD|title=An assessment of thimerosal use in childhood vaccines|journal=Pediatrics|year=2001|pages=1147–54|volume=107|issue=5|pmid=11331700|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/107/5/1147|doi=10.1542/peds.107.5.1147}}</ref> Multiple meetings were scheduled among various government officials and scientists from multiple agencies to discuss the appropriate response to this evidence. There was a wide range of opinions on the urgency and significance of the safety of thiomersal, with some [[toxicologists]] suggesting there was no clear evidence that thiomersal was harmful and other participants like Dr. [[Neal Halsey]], director of the Institute of Vaccine Safety, strongly advocating removal of thiomersal from vaccines due to possible safety risks. In the process of forming the response to this information, the participants attempted to strike a balance between acknowledging possible harm from thiomersal and the actual risks involved if childhood vaccinations were delayed or stopped.<ref name=Freed>{{cite journal|author=Freed GL, Andreae MC, Cowan AE, Katz SL|title=The Process of Public Policy Formulation: The Case of Thimerosal in Vaccines|journal=Pediatrics|volume=109|issue=6|pages=1153–9|year=2002|month=June|pmid=12042557|doi=10.1542/peds.109.6.1153

Upon conclusion of their review, the FDA, in conjunction with the other members of the US [[Public Health Service]] (USPHS), the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), CDC and [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] (HRSA), in a joint statement with the AAP in July 1999 concluded that there was "no evidence of harm caused by doses of thimerosal found in vaccines, except for local hypersensitivity reactions."<ref name=Ball/>

Despite the lack of convincing evidence of toxicity of thiomersal when used as a vaccine preservative, the USPHS and AAP determined that thiomersal should be removed from vaccines as a purely precautionary measure.<ref name=T-in-vaccines/> This action was based on the [[precautionary principle]], which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unnecessary. The CDC and AAP reasoned that despite the lack of evidence of significant harm in the use of thiomersal in vaccines, the removal of this preservative would increase the public confidence in the safety of vaccines.<ref name=Offit/> Although thiomersal was largely removed from routine infant vaccines by summer 2001 in the U.S.,<ref name=Baker>{{cite journal|journal=Am J Public Health|year=2008|title=Mercury, Vaccines, and Autism: One Controversy, Three Histories|author=Baker JP|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.113159|pmid=18172138|volume=98|issue=2|pages=244–53|pmc=2376879}}</ref> some vaccines continue to contain non-trace amounts of thiomersal, mainly in multi-dose vaccines targeted against [[influenza]] and [[tetanus]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Institute for Vaccine Safety|date=2009-10-21|url=http://vaccinesafety.edu/thi-table.htm|title=Thimerosal content in some US licensed vaccines|accessdate=2009-10-27 }}</ref>

===Rationale for concern===
[[File:US-autism-6-17-1996-2007.png|thumb|alt=Bar chart versus time. The graph rises steadily from 1996 to 2007, from about 0.7 to about 5.3. The trend curves slightly upward.|Reports of autism cases per 1,000 children grew dramatically in the U.S. from 1996 to 2007. It is unknown how much, if any, growth came from changes in autism's [[prevalence]].<ref name="prevalence"/>]] Although intended to increase public confidence in vaccinations, the decision to remove thiomersal instead led to some parents suspecting thiomersal as a cause of autism. This concern over a vaccine-autism link grew from a confluence of several underlying factors. First, methylmercury had for decades been the subject of widespread environmental and media concern after two highly publicized episodes of poisonings in the 1950s and 1960s [[Minamata disease|in Minamata Bay, Japan from industrial waste]] and in the 1970s in [[Iraq mercury poisoning incident|Iraq from fungicide contamination of wheat]]. These incidents led to new research on methylmercury safety and culminated in the publication of an array of confusing recommendations by public health agencies in the 1990s warning against methylmercury exposure in adults and pregnant women, which ensured a continued high public awareness of mercury toxicity. Second, the vaccine schedule for infants expanded in the 1990s to include more vaccines, some of which, including the [[Hib vaccine]], [[DTaP vaccine]] and [[hepatitis B vaccine]], could have contained thiomersal. Third, the [[Epidemiology of autism|number of diagnoses of autism]] grew in the 1990s, leading parents of these children to search for an explanation for the apparent rise in diagnoses, including considering possible environmental factors.<ref name="Baker"/> The dramatic increase in reported cases of autism during the 1990s and early 2000s is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rutter M|title=Incidence of autism spectrum disorders: changes over time and their meaning|journal=Acta Paediatr|volume=94|issue=1|year=2005|pages=2–15|pmid=15858952|doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2005.tb01779.x|authorlink=Professor Sir Michael Rutter}}</ref> and it is unknown whether autism's true prevalence increased during the period.<ref name="prevalence">{{cite journal|journal=Environ Health Perspect|year=2006|volume=114|issue=7|pages=A412–8|title=Tracing the Origins of Autism: A Spectrum of New Studies|author=Szpir M|url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/2006/114-7/focus.html|pmid=16835042|pmc=1513312|doi=10.1289/ehp.114-a412}}</ref> Nevertheless, some parents believed that there was a growing "autism epidemic" and connected these three factors to conclude that the increase in number of vaccines, and specifically the mercury in thiomersal in those vaccines, were causing a dramatic increase in the [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of autism.<ref name=Baker /> 

Advocates of a thiomersal-autism link also relied on indirect evidence from the scientific literature, including analogy with [[neurotoxic]] effects of other mercury compounds, the reported epidemiologic association between autism and vaccine use, and extrapolation from ''[[in vitro]]'' experiments and animal studies.<ref name=DeStefano>{{cite journal|journal= Clin Pharmacol Ther|year=2007|volume=82|issue=6|pages=756–9|title=Vaccines and Autism: Evidence Does Not Support a Causal Association|author=DeStefano F|doi=10.1038/sj.clpt.6100407|pmid=17928818}}</ref> Studies conducted by [[Mark Geier]] and his son David Geier have been the most frequently cited research by parents advocating a link between thiomersal and autism.<ref name=Harris>{{cite news|work=New York Times|url=http://nytimes.com/2005/06/25/science/25autism.htm|date=2005-06-25|title=On Autism's Cause, it's Parents vs. Research|author=Harris G, O'Connor A|accessdate=2010-07-02}}</ref> This research by Geier has received considerable criticism<ref>{{cite news|work=Slate|date=2007-05-28|accessdate=2008-01-30|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2166939/|title=Thiomersal on Trial: The Theory that Vaccines Cause Autism goes to Court|author=Allen A}}</ref> for methodological problems in his research, including not presenting methods and statistical analyses to others for verification,<ref name="critique">{{cite journal|author=Parker SK, Schwartz B, Todd J, Pickering LK|title=Thimerosal-containing Vaccines and Autistic Spectrum Disorder: A Critical Review of Published Original Data|journal=Pediatrics|year=2004|pages=793–804|volume=114|issue=3|doi=10.1542/peds.2004-0434|pmid=15342856|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/114/3/793}}{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=S|coauthors=Todd, J, Schwartz, B, Pickering, L|title=Erratum: Thimerosal-containing Caccines and Autistic Spectrum Disorder: A Critical Review of Published Original Data|journal=Pediatrics|date=2005 Jan|volume=115|issue=1|pages=200|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/115/1/200|pmid=15630018|doi=10.1542/peds.2004-2402}}</ref> improperly analyzing data taken from [[Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System]],<ref name=IOM2004/><ref name=critique/> as well as either mislabelling or confusing fundamental statistical terms in his papers, leading to results that were "uninterpretable".<ref name=IOM2004/>

===Publicity of concern===
Several months after the recommendation to have thiomersal removed from vaccines was published, a speculative article was published in ''[[Medical Hypotheses]]'',<ref name=Bernard>{{cite journal|doi= 10.1054/mehy.2000.1281|journal= Med Hypotheses|year=2001|volume=56|issue=4|pages=462–71|title= Autism: a novel form of mercury poisoning|author= Bernard S, Enayati A, Redwood L, Roger H, Binstock T|pmid=11339848}}</ref> a non-[[peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal, by parents who launched the parental advocacy group [[SafeMinds]] to promote the theory that thiomersal caused autism.<ref name=Gross /> The controversy began to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the public from this foundation,<ref name=Baker /> and gained widening support within certain elements in the autism advocacy community as well as in the political arena, with U.S. Representative [[Dan Burton]] openly supporting this movement and holding a number of Congressional hearings on the subject.<ref name=Harris/>

Further support for the association between autism and thiomersal appeared in an article by [[Robert F.

Despite the consensus from experts that there is no link between thiomersal and autism, many parents continue to hold on to their belief that such a link exists.<ref name=Sugarman>{{cite journal|journal=N Engl J Med|year=2007|volume=357|issue=13|pages=1275–7|title=Cases in vaccine court—legal battles over vaccines and autism|author=Sugarman SD|pmid=17898095|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/13/1275|doi=10.1056/NEJMp078168}}</ref> These parents share the viewpoint that autism is not just treatable, but curable through [[Biomedical intervention for autism#Medical management|"biomedical" interventions]] and have been frustrated by the lack of progress from more "mainline" scientists in finding this cure. Instead, they have supported an alternative community of like-minded parents, physicians and scientists who promote this belief. This mindset has taught these parents to challenge the expertise from the mainstream scientific community.<ref name=Baker/> Parents have also been influenced by a large number of online [[anti-vaccination]] websites that present themselves as an alternative source for evidence using [[pseudoscientific]] claims. These websites use emotional appeals to gather support and frame the controversy as an adversarial dispute between parents and a conspiracy of doctors and scientists.<ref name=Gross/> Advocates for a thiomersal-autism link have also relied on celebrities like model [[Jenny McCarthy]] and information presented on [[Don Imus|Don Imus']] ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'' radio show to persuade the public to their cause, instead of relying only on "dry" scientific papers and scientists.

==Scientific evaluation==

===Rationale for doubting link===
Various lines of evidence undermine a proposed link between thiomersal and autism. For example, although advocates of a thiomersal-autism link consider autism a form of "mercury poisoning," the [[Mercury toxicity#Signs and symptoms|typical symptoms of mercury toxicity]] are significantly different than [[Autism#Characteristics|symptoms seen in autism]]. Likewise, the [[neuroanatomy|neuroanatomic]] and [[histopathology|histopathologic]] features of the brains of patients who have mercury poisoning, both with methylmercury as well as ethylmercury, have significant differences from the brains of people with autism. Previous episodes of widespread mercury toxicity in a population such as in [[Minamata Bay]], [[Japan]] would also be expected to lead to documentation of a significant rise in autism or autism-like behavior in children should autism be caused by mercury poisoning. However, research on several episodes of acute and chronic mercury poisoning have not documented any such rise in autism like behavior. Although some parents cite an association between the timing of onset of autistic symptoms with the timing of vaccinations as evidence of an environmental cause such as thiomersal, this line of reasoning can be misleading. [[Correlation does not imply causation|Associations such as these do not establish causation]] as the two occurring together may be only coincidental in nature. Also, genetic disorders that have no environmental triggers such as [[Rett syndrome]] and [[Huntington's disease]] nevertheless have specific ages when they begin to show symptoms, suggesting specific ages of onset of symptoms does not necessarily require an environmental cause.<ref name=Nelson/> 

Although the concern for a thiomersal-autism link was originally derived from indirect evidence based on the known potent neurotoxic effects of methylmercury, recent studies show these feared effects were likely overestimated. Ethylmercury, such as in thiomersal, clears much faster from the body after administration than methylmercury, suggesting total mercury exposure over time is much less with ethylmercury. Currently used methods of estimating brain deposition of mercury likely overestimates the amounts deposited due to ethylmercury, and ethylmercury also decomposes quicker in the brain than methylmercury, suggesting a lower risk of brain damage. These findings show that the assumptions that originally led to concern about the toxicity of ethylmercury, which were based on direct comparison to methylmercury, were flawed.<ref name=Aschner>{{cite journal|author=Aschner M, Ceccatelli S|title=Are Neuropathological Conditions Relevant to Ethylmercury Exposure?|journal=Neurotox Res|year=2010|pages=59–68|issue=1|pmid=19756911|volume=18|doi=10.1007/s12640-009-9113-2}}</ref>

===Population studies===
Multiple studies have been performed on data from large populations of children to study the relationship between the use of vaccines containing thiomersal, and autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Almost all of these studies have found no association between thiomersal-containing vaccines (TCVs) and autism, and studies done after the removal of thiomersal from vaccines have nevertheless shown autism rates continuing to increase. The only epidemiologic research that has found a purported link between TCVs and autism has been conducted by Mark Geier, whose flawed research has not been given any weight by independent reviews.<ref name=IOM2004/><ref name=Doja/><ref name=DeStefano/>

In Europe, a [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] study of 467,450 Danish children found no association between TCVs and autism or [[autism spectrum disorders]] (ASDs), nor any [[dose-response relationship]] between thiomersal and ASDs that would be suggestive of toxic exposure.<ref name=Hviid>{{cite journal|author=Hviid A, Stellfeld M, Wohlfahrt J, Melbye M|title=Association between Thimerosal-containing Vaccine and Autism|journal=JAMA|year=2003|pages=1763–6|volume=290|issue=13|pmid=14519711|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/290/13/1763|doi=10.1001/jama.290.13.1763}}</ref> An [[ecological correlation|ecological]] analysis that studied 956 Danish children diagnosed with autism likewise did not show an association between autism and thiomersal.<ref name=Madsen>{{cite journal|author=Madsen KM, Lauritsen MB, Pedersen CB ''et al.''|title=Thimerosal and the Occurrence of Autism: Negative Ecological Evidence from Danish Population-based Data|journal=Pediatrics|year=2004|pages=604–6|volume=112|issue=3|pmid=12949291|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/112/3/604|doi=10.1542/peds.112.3.604}}</ref> A [[retrospective cohort study]] on 109,863 children in the United Kingdom found no association between TCVs and autism, but a possible increased risk for [[tics]].

In North America, a Canadian study of 27,749 children in Quebec showed that thiomersal was unrelated to the increasing trend in [[pervasive developmental disorders]] (PDDs).

===Scientific consensus===
Due to growing concerns in the public, in 2001 the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health asked the [[National Academy of Science|U.S. National Academy of Science's]] (NAS) Institute of Medicine to establish an independent expert committee to review hypotheses about existing and emerging immunization safety concerns. This initial report found that based on indirect and incomplete evidence available at the time, there was inadequate evidence to accept or reject a thiomersal-autism link, though it was biologically plausible.<ref>{{cite book|author=Immunization Safety Review Committee, Board on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, Institute of Medicine|title=Immunization Safety Review: Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines and Neurodevelopmental Disorders|publisher=National Academy Press|location=Washington, DC|year=2001|isbn=0-309-09008-3|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10208.html}}</ref></blockquote>

Since this report was released, several independent reviews have examined the body of published research for a possible thiomersal-autism link by examining the theoretical mechanisms of thiomersal causing harm and by reviewing the ''in vitro'', animal, and population studies that have been published. These reviews determined that no significant evidence exists to establish thiomersal as the cause of autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.<ref name=IOM2004/><ref name=Doja/><ref name=DeStefano/><ref name=Parker>{{cite journal|journal=Pediatrics|year=2004|volume=114|title=Thimerosal-containing vaccines and autistic spectrum disorder: a critical review of published original data|author=Parker SK, Schwartz B, Todd J, Pickering LK|doi=10.1542/peds.2004-0434|pmid=15342856|issue=3|pages=793–804}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Parker S, Todd J, Schwartz B, Pickering L|title=Thimerosal-containing vaccines and autistic spectrum disorder: a critical review of published original data|journal=Pediatrics|volume=115|issue=1|pages=200|year=2005|month=January|pmid=15630018|doi=10.1542/peds.2004-2402
|accessdate=2012-03-24}}</ref>

The scientific consensus on the subject is reflected in a follow up report that was subsequently published in 2004 by the Institute of Medicine, which took into account new data that had been published since the 2001 report. The committee noted, in response to those who cite ''[[in vitro]]'' or [[animal models]] as evidence for the link between autism and thiomersal:

<blockquote>"However, the experiments showing effects of thimerosal on biochemical pathways in cell culture systems and showing abnormalities in the immune system or metal metabolism in people with autism are provocative; the autism research community should consider the appropriate composition of the autism research portfolio with some of these new findings in mind. However, these experiments do not provide evidence of a relationship between vaccines or thimerosal and autism.

In the absence of experimental or human evidence that vaccination (either the MMR vaccine or the preservative thimerosal) affects metabolic, developmental, immune, or other physiological or molecular mechanisms that are causally related to the development of autism, the committee concludes that the hypotheses generated to date are theoretical only."<ref name="IOM2004"/></blockquote>

The committee concludes:

<blockquote>"Thus, based on this body of evidence, '''the committee concludes that the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.'''"<ref name="IOM2004"/> [bold in original]</blockquote>

Further evidence of the scientific consensus includes the rejection of a causal link between thiomersal and autism by multiple national and international scientific and medical bodies including the [[American Medical Association]],<ref>{{cite web|author=American Medical Association|authorlink=American Medical Association|date=2004-05-18|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/36/press_iom_mmr.doc|title=AMA Welcomes New IOM Report Rejecting Link Between Vaccines and Autism|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref> the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]],<ref>{{cite web|author=American Academy of Pediatrics|authorlink=American Academy of Pediatrics|date=2004-05-18|url=http://www.cispimmunize.org/fam/autism/thimerosal.htm|title=What Parents Should Know About Thimerosal|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref> the [[American College of Medical Toxicology]],<ref>{{cite journal|journal=J Med Toxicol|year=2006|volume=2|issue=4|pages=170–1|title=ACMT position statement: the Iom report on thimerosal and autism|author=Kurt TL|pmid=18072140|url=http://jmt.pennpress.org/strands/jmt/pdfHandler.pdf?issue=20060204&file=20060204_170_171.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1007/BF03161188}}</ref> the [[Canadian Paediatric Society]],<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Paediatr Child Health|year=2007|volume=12|issue=5|pages=393–5|title=Autistic spectrum disorder: No causal relationship with vaccines|author=Infectious Diseases and Immunization Committee, Canadian Paediatric Society|url=http://cps.ca/english/statements/ID/pidnote_jun07.htm|accessdate=2008-10-17}} Also published (2007) in ''Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol'' '''18''' (3): 177–9.

A 2011 journal article reflects this point of view and described the vaccine-autism connection as "the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years".<ref name=Klaherty>{{cite journal|author=Flaherty DK|title=The Vaccine-autism Connection: A Public Health Crisis Caused by Unethical Medical Practices and Fraudulent Science|journal=Ann Pharmacother|volume=45|issue=10|pages=1302–4|year=2011|month=October|pmid=21917556|doi=10.1345/aph.1Q318}}</ref>

==Consequences==
The suggestion that thiomersal has contributed to autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders has had a number of effects. Public health officials believe fear driven by advocates of a thiomersal-autism link has caused parents to avoid vaccination<ref name=Harris/> or adopt "made up" vaccination schedules that expose their children to increased risk from preventable diseases such as [[measles]] and [[pertussis]].<ref name=Gross/> Advocates of a thiomersal-autism link have also helped enact laws in six states (California, Delaware, Illinois, Missouri, New York and Washington) between 2004 and 2006 to limit the use of thiomersal given to pregnant women and children, although later attempts in 2009 in twelve other states failed to pass. These laws can be temporarily suspended, but vaccine advocates doubt their utility given the lack of evidence for danger with thiomersal in vaccines. Vaccine advocates are also concerned that passage of such laws help fuel a backlash against vaccination and contribute to doubts about the safety of vaccines that are unwarranted.<ref name="Schubert">{{cite journal|author=Schubert C|title=Pandemic blows lid off laws limiting mercury in vaccines|journal=Nat. Med.|volume=16|issue=1|pages=9|year=2010|month=January|pmid=20057400|doi=10.1038/nm0110-9a}}</ref>

During the period of time of removal of thiomersal, the CDC and AAP asked doctors to delay the birth dose of [[hepatitis B]] vaccine in children not at risk for hepatitis. This decision, though following the precautionary principle, nevertheless sparked confusion, controversy and some harm. Approximately 10% of hospitals suspended the use of hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns, and one child born to a Michigan mother infected with hepatitis B virus died of it.<ref name=Offit/> Similarly, a study found that the number of hospitals who failed to properly vaccinate infants of hepatitis B [[seropositive]] mothers rose by over 6 times. This is a potential negative outcome given the high probability that infants who acquire hepatitis B infection at birth will develop the infection in a chronic form and possibly [[liver cancer]].<ref name=Baker />

The notion that thiomersal causes autism has led some parents to have their children treated with costly and potentially dangerous therapies such as [[chelation therapy]], which is typically used to treat [[heavy metal poisoning]], due to parental fears that autism is a form of "mercury poisoning".<ref name=Harris/> As many as 2 to 8% of autistic children in the U.S., numbering as many as several thousand children per year, receive mercury-chelating agents.<ref name=chelatetrial>{{cite journal|journal=Science|year=2008|volume=321|issue=5887|pages=326|title=Stalled Trial for Autism Highlights Dilemma of Alternative Treatments|author=Stokstad E|doi=10.1126/science.321.5887.326|pmid=18635766}}</ref> Although critics of using chelation therapy as an autism treatment point to a lack of any evidence to support its use, hundreds of doctors prescribe these medications despite possible side effects including nutritional deficiencies as well as damage to the liver and kidney.<ref name=Harris/> The popularity of this therapy caused a "public health imperative" that led the U.S. [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH) to commission a study about chelation in autism by studying [[DMSA]], a chelating agent used for lead poisoning, despite worries from critics that there would be no chance it would show positive results and it would be unlikely to convince parents to not use the therapy. Ultimately, the study was halted due to ethical concerns that there would be too much risk to children with autism who did not have toxic levels of mercury or lead due to a new animal study showing possible cognitive and emotional problems associated with DMSA.<ref name=chelatetrial/> A 5-year-old autistic boy died from cardiac arrest immediately after receiving chelation therapy treatment using EDTA in 2005.<ref name=Chelation>{{cite news|author=USAToday.com|date=2005-08-25|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-08-25-boy-killed_x.htm|title=Autistic boy dies after unproven treatment|accessdate=2009-08-22|work=USA Today}}</ref> 

The notion has also diverted attention and resources away from efforts to determine the causes of autism.<ref name=Offit>{{cite journal|journal=N Engl J Med|year=2007|volume=357|issue=13|pages=1278–9|title=Thimerosal and vaccines—a cautionary tale|author=Offit PA|doi=10.1056/NEJMp078187|pmid=17898096|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/13/1278|authorlink=Paul Offit}}</ref> The 2004 Institute of Medicine report committee recommended that while it supported "targeted research that focuses on better understanding the disease of autism, from a public health perspective the committee does not consider a significant investment in studies of the theoretical vaccine-autism connection to be useful at this time."<ref name=IOM2004/> Alison Singer, a senior executive of [[Autism Speaks]], resigned from the group in 2009 in a dispute over whether to fund more research on links between vaccination and autism, saying, "There isn't an unlimited pot of money, and every dollar spent looking where we know the answer isn't is one less dollar we have to spend where we might find new answers."<ref name=Luscombe>{{cite news|title=Charity chief quits over autism row|author=Luscombe R|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/25/autism-mmr-vaccine|date=2009-01-25|accessdate=2009-02-01|work=Observer|location=London}}</ref>

==Court cases==
{{Further2|[[Vaccine court]]}}
From 1988 until August 2010, 5,632 claims relating to autism were made to Office of Special Masters of the [[U.S. Court of Federal Claims]] (commonly known as the "Vaccine Court") which oversees vaccine injury claims, of which one case has received compensation, 738 cases have been dismissed with no compensations made, and with the remaining cases pending.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statistics_report.htm|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2008-01-08|title=National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program statistics reports|publisher=Health Resources and Services Administration}}</ref> In the one case which received compensation, the U.S. government agreed to pay for injury to a child that had a pre-existing [[Mitochondrial disease|mitochondrial disorder]] who developed autism-like symptoms after multiple vaccinations, some of which included thiomersal. Citing the inability to rule out a role of these vaccinations in exacerbating her underlying mitochondrial disorder as the rationale for payment, CDC officials cautioned against generalizing this one case to all autism-related vaccine cases as most patients with autism do not have a mitochondrial disorder.<ref>{{cite news|author=Stobbe M, Marchione M|title= Analysis: vaccine-autism link unproven|work=Associated Press|date=2008-03-07|url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2008/03/07/analysis_vaccine_payment_no_landmark/|accessdate=2008-06-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=J Clin Invest|year=2008|volume=118|issue=5|pages=1586–7|title=Attention focuses on autism|author=Honey K|doi=10.1172/JCI35821|pmid=18451989|url=http://jci.org/articles/view/35821|pmc=2336894}}</ref> In February 2009, this court also ruled on three autism-related cases, each exploring different mechanisms that plaintiffs proposed linked thiomersal-containing vaccines with autism.
