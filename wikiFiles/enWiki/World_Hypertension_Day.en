'''World Hypertension Day''' is a day designated and initiated by [[The World Hypertension League]] ([[The World Hypertension League|WHL]]), which is itself an umbrella to organizations of 85 national hypertension societies and leagues. The day was initiated to increase the awareness of hypertension. This was especially important because of the lack of appropriate knowledge among hypertensive patients.<ref name="pmid17534457">{{cite journal |author=Chockalingam A |title=Impact of World Hypertension Day |journal=[[The Canadian Journal of Cardiology]] |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=517–9 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17534457 |pmc=2650754 |doi= 10.1016/S0828-282X(07)70795-X|url= |issn= |accessdate=2009-06-22}}</ref>  The WHL launched its first WHD on May 14, 2005.

In 2005, as the inaugural effort, the theme was simply ‘Awareness of [[high blood pressure]]’. The 2006 theme was ‘Treat to goal’, with a focus on keeping blood pressure under control.<ref name="pmid17534457" /> The recommended blood pressures are less than 140/90 mmHg for the general population and for the hypertensive population without any other complications, and less than 130/80 mmHg for those with [[diabetes mellitus]] or [[Chronic renal failure|chronic kidney disease]]. These are the cut-off values recommended by international and Canadian guidelines.<ref name="pmid16755315">{{cite journal |author=Campbell NR, Petrella R, Kaczorowski J |title=Public education on hypertension: a new initiative to improve the prevention, treatment and control of hypertension in Canada |journal=[[The Canadian Journal of Cardiology]] |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=599–603 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16755315 |pmc=2560867 |doi= |url= |issn= |accessdate=2009-06-22}}</ref><ref name="pmid16755312">{{cite journal |author=Hemmelgarn BR, McAlister FA, Grover S, ''et al.'' |title=The 2006 Canadian Hypertension Education Program recommendations for the management of hypertension: Part I--Blood pressure measurement, diagnosis and assessment of risk |journal=[[The Canadian Journal of Cardiology]] |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=573–81 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16755312 |pmc=2560864 |doi= 10.1016/S0828-282X(06)70279-3|url= |issn= |accessdate=2009-06-22}}</ref> The 2007 WHD theme was ‘[[Healthy diet]], healthy [[blood pressure]]’.
