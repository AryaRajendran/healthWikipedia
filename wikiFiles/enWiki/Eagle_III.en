==Objectives==
The primary mission for Eagle III is emergency air medical services to include scene flights and transport of critically ill or injured patients to facilities with specialized or greater levels of care. In addition to this, Eagle III also provides air support to local law enforcement agencies upon request due to its prime location and ability to rapidly deploy aircraft. Eagle III also flies support missions for the U.S. Secret Service during presidential visits.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

==Aircraft==
Eagle III’s primary aircraft is a [[Eurocopter EC 135]] (N135CR) with a  [[Bell 206]] (N396JS) serving as secondary. In the past the Eagle III program has operated a [[Bell 407]] (N407CR) which has been retired, and a [[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm]] [[MBB Bo 105|Bo 105]] (N202LF) which was lost in an accident on April 13, 2006. That was the first accident for County Rescue's air ambulance service. The program began in May 1998 with the purchase of the $1.8 million Bell 407 aircraft and construction of a $200,000 hangar and helipad at the Bellevue headquarters.<ref name=Nelesen>{{cite news
