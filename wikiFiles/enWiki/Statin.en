'''Statins''' (or '''HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors''') are a class of [[drugs]] used to lower [[cholesterol]] levels by [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibit]]ing the enzyme [[HMG-CoA reductase]], which plays a central role in the production of cholesterol in the [[liver]]. Increased cholesterol levels have been associated with [[cardiovascular disease]]s,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lewington S |title=Blood cholesterol and vascular mortality by age, sex, and blood pressure: a meta-analysis of individual data from 61 prospective studies with 55,000 vascular deaths |journal=Lancet |volume=370 |issue=9602 |pages=1829–39 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18061058 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61778-4 |author-separator=, |author2=Whitlock G |author3=Clarke R |display-authors=3 |last4=Clarke |first4=R |last5=Sherliker |first5=P |last6=Emberson |first6=J |last7=Halsey |first7=J |last8=Qizilbash |first8=N |last9=Peto |first9=R}}</ref> and statins are therefore used in the [[Preventive medicine|prevention]] of these diseases. Research has found that statins are most effective for treating cardiovascular disease (CVD) ([[secondary prevention]]), with questionable benefit in those without previous CVD, but with elevated cholesterol levels.<ref name=NICEquick>{{cite web |author=[[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] |title=Lipid modification - Cardiovascular risk assessment and the modification of blood lipids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease - Quick reference guide |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/11982/40675/40675.pdf |format=PDF |date=May 2008, reissued March 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref><ref name=Cochrane11/> Statins have rare but severe adverse effects, particularly muscle damage, and some doctors believe they are overprescribed. 

The best-selling statin is [[atorvastatin]], marketed as Lipitor (manufactured by [[Pfizer]]) and Torvast. By 2003, atorvastatin became the best-selling [[pharmaceutical]] in history,<ref name=Simons/> with Pfizer reporting sales of [[US$]]12.4 billion in 2008.<ref>[http://media.pfizer.com/files/annualreport/2008/annual/review2008.pdf "Doing Things Differently"], Pfizer 2008 Annual Review, April 23, 2009, p. 15.</ref> As of 2010, a [[#Available forms|number of statins]] are on the market: atorvastatin (Lipitor and Torvast), [[fluvastatin]] (Lescol), [[lovastatin]] (Mevacor, Altocor, Altoprev), [[pitavastatin]] (Livalo, Pitava), [[pravastatin]] (Pravachol, Selektine, Lipostat), [[rosuvastatin]] (Crestor) and [[simvastatin]] (Zocor, Lipex).<ref name=Martindale>{{cite book |editor=Sweetman, Sean C. |chapter=Cardiovascular drugs |title=Martindale: the complete drug reference |edition=36th |year=2009 |pages=1155–434 |publisher=Pharmaceutical Press |location=London|isbn=978-0-85369-840-1}}</ref> Several combination preparations of a statin and another agent, such as [[ezetimibe/simvastatin]], are also available.

==Medical uses==
[[Clinical practice guidelines]] generally recommend people to try "lifestyle modification", including a cholesterol-lowering diet and [[physical exercise]], before statin use is considered; statins or other pharmacologic agents may then be recommended for those who do not meet their lipid-lowering goals through diet and lifestyle approaches.<ref name="ATPIII">{{cite book | author = National Cholesterol Education Program | title = Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III): Executive Summary | year = 2001 | pages = 40 | publisher = National Institutes of Health.

===Secondary prevention===

Statins are effective in decreasing mortality in people with pre-existing [[cardiovascular disease|CVD]]. They are also currently advocated for use in patients at high risk of developing heart disease.<ref name="NICEquick"/> On average, statins can lower [[LDL cholesterol]] by 1.8&nbsp;mmol/l (70&nbsp;mg/dl), which translates into a 60% decrease in the number of cardiac events (heart attack, sudden cardiac death) and a 17% reduced risk of [[stroke]] after long-term treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Law MR, Wald NJ, Rudnicka AR |title=Quantifying effect of statins on low density lipoprotein cholesterol, ischaemic heart disease, and stroke: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7404 |pages=1423 |year=2003 |month=June|pmid=12829554 |pmc=162260 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7404.1423 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/326/7404/1423}}</ref> They have less effect than the [[fibrate]]s or [[niacin]] in reducing [[triglyceride]]s and raising [[HDL-cholesterol]] ("good cholesterol").

===Comparative effectiveness===
While no direct comparison exists, all statins appear equally effective regardless of potency or degree of cholesterol reduction.<ref name=CMAJ11/>

A comparison of atorvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin, based on their effectiveness against [[placebo]]s, found, at commonly prescribed doses, no [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] differences among agents in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhou Z, Rahme E, Pilote L |title=Are statins created equal? Evidence from randomized trials of pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin for cardiovascular disease prevention |journal=Am.

==Controversy==
Some scientists believe the statins are overused. Their use has expanded into areas where they provide lesser benefit, and lesser evidence of benefit. The lower the risk of cardiovascular events, the lower the ratio is of benefits to costs. The US market for statins nearly tripled when the National Cholesterol Education Program revised its guidelines to recommend statins as primary prevention. Although the panel cited randomized trials to support statin therapy for primary prevention of occlusive cardiovascular disease, a report in ''Lancet'' notes, "not one of the studies provides such evidence." <ref name="Abramson2007">{{cite journal |author=Abramson J, Wright J |title=Are lipid-lowering guidelines evidence-based? |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9557 |pages=168–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17240267| doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60084-1}}</ref> Journalists have questioned the interests of the doctors who made such recommendations, as eight of the 9 doctors on the panel were discovered to have been paid by statin manufacturers.<ref name="USATodayCholesterolGuidelines">{{cite journal |author=Associated Press |title=Cholesterol guidelines become a morality play |journal=USA Today |date=16 October 2004 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2004-10-16-panel-conflict-of-interest_x.htm}}</ref>

A smaller group of scientists, [[The International Network of Cholesterol Skeptics]], question the [[lipid hypothesis]] and argue that elevated cholesterol has not been adequately shown to cause heart disease. These organizations maintain that statins are not as beneficial or safe as suggested.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ravnskov U, Rosch P, Sutter M, Houston M |title=Should we lower cholesterol as much as possible? |journal=BMJ |volume=332 |issue=7553 |pages=1330–2 |year=2006 |pmid=16740566|doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7553.1330|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/332/7553/1330 |pmc=1473073}}</ref> The beneficial effects of statins are suggested to be due to their working as [[vitamin D]] analogues.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68971-X}}</ref>

===Drug interactions===
Combining any statin with a [[fibrate]] or [[niacin]], another category of lipid-lowering drugs, increases the risks for [[rhabdomyolysis]] to almost 6.0 per 10,000 person-years.<ref name="Graham2004"/> Most physicians have now abandoned routine monitoring of liver enzymes and [[creatine kinase]], although they still consider this prudent in those on high-dose statins or in those on statin/fibrate combinations, and mandatory in the case of muscle cramps or of deterioration in [[renal function]].

Consumption of [[grapefruit]] or [[grapefruit juice]] inhibits the metabolism of certain statins. [[Bitter orange]]s may have a similar effect.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/food-and-nutrition/AN00413 Mayo clinic: article on interference between grapefruit and medication]</ref> Furanocoumarins in grapefruit juice (i.e. [[bergamottin]] and [[dihydroxybergamottin]]) inhibit the [[Cytochrome P450 oxidase|cytochrome P450]] enzyme [[CYP3A4]], which is involved in the metabolism of most statins (however, it is a major inhibitor of only lovastatin, simvastatin, and to a lesser degree, atorvastatin) and some other medications<ref name="Kane2000">{{cite journal |author=Kane GC, Lipsky JJ |title=Drug-grapefruit juice interactions |journal=Mayo Clin. Proc. |volume=75 |issue=9 |pages=933–42 |year=2000 |pmid=10994829 |doi=10.4065/75.9.933}}</ref> (flavonoids (i.e. [[naringin]]) were thought to be responsible). This increases the levels of the statin, increasing the risk of dose-related adverse effects (including [[myopathy]]/[[rhabdomyolysis]]). The absolute proscription of grapefruit juice consumption for users of some statins is controversial.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Letters to the Editor: The Grapefruit-Drug Interaction Debate: Role of Statins |first1=Brian V. |last1=Reamy |first2=Mark B. |last2=Stephens |journal=American Family Physician |date=July 15, 2007 |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=190–192 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/0715/p190.html}}</ref>

The FDA notified healthcare professionals  of updates to the prescribing information concerning interactions between  protease inhibitors and certain statin  drugs. Protease inhibitors and statins taken together may raise the blood levels of statins and increase the risk for muscle injury (myopathy). The most serious form of myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, can damage the kidneys and lead to kidney failure, which can be fatal.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm294294.htm FDA Website Statins and HIV or Hepatitis C Drugs: Drug Safety Communication - Interaction Increases Risk of Muscle Injury]</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
[[File:Avorstatin binding.png|thumb|Avorstatin bound to HMG-CoA reductase: [[Protein Data Bank|PDB]] entry {{PDBe|1hwk}}<ref>{{cite pmid|11349148}}</ref>]][[Image:HMG-CoA reductase pathway.png|thumb|right|280px|The HMG-CoA reductase pathway, which is blocked by statins via inhibiting the rate limiting enzyme [[HMG-CoA reductase]].]]
{{Main|Cholesterol#Homeostasis|l1=Cholesterol homeostasis}}

Statins act by [[competitive inhibitor|competitively inhibiting]] [[HMG-CoA reductase]], the first committed [[enzyme]] of the [[HMG-CoA reductase pathway]]. Because statins are similar to HMG-CoA on a molecular level, they take the place of HMG-CoA in the enzyme and reduce the rate by which it is able to produce [[mevalonate]], the next molecule in the [[mevalonate pathway|cascade that eventually produces cholesterol]], as well as a number of other compounds. This ultimately reduces cholesterol via several mechanisms.

===Inhibiting cholesterol synthesis===
By inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, statins block the pathway for synthesizing cholesterol in the liver. This is significant because most circulating cholesterol comes from internal manufacture rather than the diet. When the liver can no longer produce cholesterol, levels of cholesterol in the blood will fall. Cholesterol synthesis appears to occur mostly at night,<ref>{{cite journal| title = Diurnal variation of cholesterol precursors squalene and methyl sterols in human plasma lipoproteins| author = Miettinen TA | journal=Journal of Lipid Research| year=1982| month= March| volume = 23 | pages=466–73|url=http://www.jlr.org/cgi/content/abstract/23/3/466| pmid = 7200504| issue = 3}}</ref> so statins with short [[half-life|half-lives]] are usually taken at night to maximize their effect. Studies have shown greater LDL and total cholesterol reductions in the short-acting simvastatin taken at night rather than the morning,<ref>{{cite journal | title = Comparison between morning and evening doses of simvastatin in hyperlipidemic subjects.

===Increasing LDL uptake===
In rabbits, [[hepatocyte]]s (liver cells) sense the reduced levels of liver cholesterol and seek to compensate by synthesizing [[LDL receptor]]s to draw cholesterol out of the circulation.<ref name="Ma1986">{{cite journal |author=Ma PT, Gil G, Südhof TC, Bilheimer DW, Goldstein JL, Brown MS |title=Mevinolin, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, induces mRNA for low density lipoprotein receptor in livers of hamsters and rabbits |journal=Proc.

The LDL receptor then relocates to the liver [[cell membrane]] and binds to passing [[low density lipoprotein|LDL]] and [[very low density lipoprotein|VLDL]] particles (the "bad cholesterol" linked to disease). LDL and VLDL are drawn out of circulation into the liver, where the cholesterol is reprocessed into bile salts. These are excreted, and subsequently recycled mostly by an internal bile salt circulation.

===Other effects===
Statins exhibit action beyond lipid-lowering activity in the prevention of [[atherosclerosis]]. The [[ASTEROID trial]] showed direct [[intravascular ultrasound|ultrasound]] evidence of [[atheroma]] regression during statin therapy.<ref name="Nissen2006">{{cite journal | author = Nissen S, Nicholls S, Sipahi I, Libby P, Raichlen J, Ballantyne C, Davignon J, Erbel R, Fruchart J, Tardif J, Schoenhagen P, Crowe T, Cain V, Wolski K, Goormastic M, Tuzcu E | title = Effect of very high-intensity statin therapy on regression of coronary atherosclerosis: the ASTEROID trial | journal = JAMA | volume = 295 | issue = 13 | pages = 1556–65 | year = 2006 | url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/295/13/1556 | pmid=16533939 | doi = 10.1001/jama.295.13.jpc60002}}</ref> Researchers hypothesize that statins prevent [[cardiovascular disease]] via four proposed mechanisms (all subjects of a large body of biomedical research):<ref name="Furberg">{{cite journal |author=Furberg CD |title=Natural Statins and Stroke Risk |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/99/2/185|journal=Circulation |volume=99|date=19 January 1999|pages=185–188|pmid=9892578 |issue=2 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.99.2.185 }}</ref>

Statins may even benefit those without high cholesterol. In 2008, the JUPITER study showed fewer strokes, heart attacks, and surgeries even for patients who had no history of [[hyperlipidemia|high cholesterol]] or heart disease, but only elevated [[C-reactive protein]] levels. There were also 20% fewer deaths (mainly from reduction in cancer deaths) though deaths from cardiovascular causes were not reduced.<ref name="Ridker2008">{{cite journal | author = Ridker PM | title = Rosuvastatin to prevent vascular events in men and women with elevated C-reactive protein | journal = NEJM | volume = 359 | pages = 2195–207 | year = 2008 | url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/NEJMoa0807646v1.pdf | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0807646 | pmid = 18997196 | issue = 21 | author-separator = , | author2 = Danielson E | author3 = Fonseca FAH | display-authors = 3 | last4 = Genest | first4 = Jacques | last5 = Gotto | first5 = Antonio M. | last6 = Kastelein | first6 = John J.P. | last7 = Koenig | first7 = Wolfgang | last8 = Libby | first8 = Peter | last9 = Lorenzatti | first9 = Alberto J.}}</ref>

==Pharmacogenomics==
A 2004 study showed patients with one of two common [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs) (small genetic variations) in the HMG-CoA reductase gene were less responsive to statins.<ref name="Chasman 2004">{{cite journal |author=Chasman DI, Posada D, Subrahmanyan L, Cook NR, Stanton VP, Ridker PM |title=Pharmacogenetic study of statin therapy and cholesterol reduction |journal=JAMA |volume=291 |issue=23 |pages=2821–7 |year=2004 |pmid=15199031 |doi=10.1001/jama.291.23.2821|url= http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/291/23/2821}}</ref> A 2008 study showed carriers of the ''KIF6'' genetic mutation were more responsive to statin treatment.<ref>{{cite pmid|18222355}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|Statin development}}
In 1971, [[Akira Endo (biochemist)|Akira Endo]], a Japanese biochemist working for the pharmaceutical company [[Daiichi Sankyo|Sankyo]], began the search for a cholesterol-lowering drug. Research had already shown cholesterol is mostly manufactured by the body in the liver, using the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase.<ref name=Simons/> Endo and his team reasoned that certain microorganisms may produce inhibitors of the enzyme to defend themselves against other organisms, as [[mevalonate]] is a precursor of many substances required by organisms for the maintenance of their cell walls ([[ergosterol]]) or [[cytoskeleton]] ([[isoprenoid]]s).<ref name="Endo1992">{{cite journal |author=Endo A |title=The discovery and development of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors |journal=J. Lipid Res. |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=1569–82 |date=1 November 1992|pmid=1464741 |url=http://www.jlr.org/cgi/reprint/33/11/1569|format=PDF }}</ref> The first agent they identified was [[mevastatin]] (ML-236B), a molecule produced by the fungus ''Penicillium citrinum''.

A British group isolated the same compound from ''Penicillium brevicompactum'', named it [[compactin]], and published their report in 1976.<ref>"Crystal and Molecular Structure of Compactin, a New Antifungal Metabolite from Penicillium brevicompactum." Alian G. Brown, Terry C. Smale, Trevor J. King, Rainer Hasenkamp and Ronald H. Thompson. ''J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 1'', '''1976''', 1165-1170. DOI: 10.1039/P19760001165</ref> The British group mentions antifungal properties, with no mention of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition.

Mevastatin was never marketed, because of its adverse effects of tumors, muscle deterioration, and sometimes death in laboratory dogs. [[P. Roy Vagelos]], chief scientist and later CEO of [[Merck & Co]], was interested, and made several trips to Japan starting in 1975. By 1978, Merck had isolated [[lovastatin]] (mevinolin, MK803) from the fungus ''[[Aspergillus terreus]]'', first marketed in 1987 as Mevacor.<ref name=Simons>Simons, John. [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2003/01/20/335643 "The $10 billion pill"], ''Fortune'' magazine, January 20, 2003.</ref>

A link between cholesterol and cardiovascular disease, known as the [[lipid hypothesis]], had already been suggested. Cholesterol is the main constituent of [[atheroma]], the fatty lumps in the wall of [[artery|arteries]] that occur in [[atherosclerosis]] and, when ruptured, cause the vast majority of [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]]. Treatment consisted mainly of [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary measures]], such as a [[low-fat diet]], and poorly tolerated medicines, such as [[clofibrate]], [[cholestyramine]], and [[nicotinic acid]]. Cholesterol researcher Daniel Steinberg writes that while the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial of 1984 demonstrated cholesterol lowering could significantly reduce the risk of heart attacks and angina, physicians, including cardiologists, remained largely unconvinced.<ref>Steinberg, Daniel. ''The Cholesterol Wars: The Skeptics vs. The Preponderance of Evidence''. Academic Press, 2007, pp. 6&ndash;9.</ref>

To market statins effectively, Merck had to convince the public about the dangers of high cholesterol, and doctors that statins were safe and would extend lives. As a result of public campaigns, people became familiar with their cholesterol numbers and the difference between [[HDL-cholesterol|"good"]] and [[LDL cholesterol|"bad"]] cholesterol, and rival pharmaceutical companies began producing their own statins, such as pravastatin (Pravachol), manufactured by Sankyo and [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]]. In April 1994, the results of a Merck-sponsored study, the [[Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study]], were announced. Researchers tested [[simvastatin]], later sold by Merck as Zocor, on 4,444 patients with high cholesterol and heart disease. After five years, the study concluded the patients saw a 35% reduction in their cholesterol, and their chances of dying of a heart attack were reduced by 42%.<ref name=Simons/><ref name="4S">{{cite journal |author= |title=Randomised trial of cholesterol lowering in 4444 patients with coronary heart disease: the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) |journal=Lancet |volume=344 |issue=8934 |pages=1383–9 |year=1994 |month=November |pmid=7968073 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(94)90566-5 |last1= Scandinaviansimvastatinsurvival}}</ref> In 1995, Zocor and Mevacor both made Merck over US$1 billion.<ref name=Simons/> Endo was awarded the 2006 [[Japan Prize]], and the [[Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award]] in 2008.

LDL-lowering potency varies between agents.
