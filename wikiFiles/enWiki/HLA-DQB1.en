'''Major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ beta 1''', also known as '''HLA-DQB1''', is a human [[gene]] and also denotes the genetic [[locus (genetics)|locus]] that contains this gene.<ref name = "Entrez_Gene_3119">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: HLA-DQB1 major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ beta 1| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=3119| accessdate = }}</ref> The [[protein]] encoded by this gene is one of two proteins that are required to form the [[HLA-DQ|DQ heterodimer]], a cell surface [[immune receptor|receptor]] essential to the function of the [[immune system]]. 

==Function==
HLA-DQB1 belongs to the [[MHC class II|HLA class II]] beta chain [[Homology_%28biology%29#Paralogy|paralogues]]. This class II molecule is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha (DQA) and a beta chain (DQB), both anchored in the membrane. It plays a central role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins. Class II molecules are expressed in [[antigen-presenting cells]] (APC: B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages).<ref name = "Entrez_Gene_3119"/>

==Gene structure and polymorphisms==
The beta chain is approximately 26-28 kDa and it contains 5 [[exon]]s. Exon one encodes the leader peptide, exons 2 and 3 encode the two extracellular [[protein domain]]s, exon 4 encodes the [[transmembrane protein|transmembrane]] domain, and exon 5 encodes the [[cytoplasm]]ic tail. Within the DQ molecule, both the alpha chain and the beta chain contain the [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s specifying the peptide binding specificities, resulting in up to 4 different molecules. Typing for these polymorphisms is routinely done for [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone marrow transplantation]].<ref name = "Entrez_Gene_3119"/><ref name="pmid7547576">{{cite journal | author = Lau M, Terasaki PI, Park MS | title = International Cell Exchange, 1994 | journal = Clin Transpl | volume = | issue = | pages = 467–88 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7547576 | doi = | url = | issn = }}</ref>

==Disease association==
===Diabetes===
Several [[allele]]s of HLA-DQB1 are associated with an increased risk of developing [[diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]].<ref name="pmid2187469">{{cite journal | author = Todd JA | title = Genetic control of autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes | journal = Immunol.

Again the DQB1*0201 and DQB1*0302 alleles, particularly the phenotype DQB1*0201/*0302 has a high risk of late onset type 1 diabetes. The risk is partially shared with the HLA-DR locus (DR3 and DR4 serotypes).

===Celiac disease===
Celiac1 is a genetic name for DQB1, the HLA DQB1*0201, *0202, and *0302 encode genes that mediate the [[autoimmune disease|autoimmune]] [[coeliac disease]]. Homozygotes of DQB1*0201 have a higher risk of developing the celiac disease, relative to any other genetic locus.<ref name="pmid17919990">{{cite journal | author = Murray JA, Moore SB, Van Dyke CT, ''et al.'' | title = HLA DQ gene dosage and risk and severity of celiac disease | journal = Clin.

Certain HLA-DQB1 alleles are also linked to a modest increased risk of [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref name="pmid9300661">{{cite journal | author = Dyment DA, Sadovnick AD, Ebers GC, Sadnovich AD | title = Genetics of multiple sclerosis | journal = Hum.
