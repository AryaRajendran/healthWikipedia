The main goals in the '''management of [[atrial fibrillation]]''' (AF) are to prevent temporary circulatory instability and to prevent [[stroke]]. Control of [[heart rate]] and rhythm are principally used to achieve the former, while [[anticoagulation]] may be required to decrease the risk of stroke.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Prystowsky EN|title=Management of atrial fibrillation: therapeutic options and clinical decisions|journal=Am J Cardiol|year=2000|pages=3D–11D|volume=85|issue=10A|doi=10.1016/S0002-9149(00)00908-5|pmid=10822035}}</ref> In emergencies, when [[circulatory collapse]] is imminent due to uncontrolled [[tachycardia|rapid heart rate]], immediate [[cardioversion]] may be indicated.<ref name="pmid16908781">{{cite journal|author=Fuster V, Rydén LE, Cannom DS, ''et al.''|title=ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines and the European Society of Cardiology Committee for Practice Guidelines (Writing Committee to Revise the 2001 Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation): developed in collaboration with the European Heart Rhythm Association and the Heart Rhythm Society|journal=Circulation|volume=114|issue=7|pages=e257–354|year=2006|pmid=16908781|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.177292}}</ref>

The primary factors determining AF treatment are duration and evidence of circulatory instability. Cardioversion is indicated with new onset AF (for less than 48 hours) and with circulatory instability. If rate and rhythm control cannot be maintained by medication or cardioversion, it may be necessary to perform [[Cardiac electrophysiology|electrophysiological studies]] with [[Radiofrequency ablation|ablation]] of abnormal electrical pathways.<ref name="pmid16908781"/>

==Anticoagulation==
Most patients with AF are at increased risk of stroke. The possible exceptions are those with [[lone AF]] (LAF), characterized by absence of clinical or echocardiographic findings of other cardiovascular disease (including hypertension), related pulmonary disease, or cardiac abnormalities such as enlargement of the left atrium, and age under 60 years .<ref name="pmid17548732">{{cite journal|author=Jahangir A, Lee V, Friedman PA, Trusty JM, Hodge DO, Kopecky SL, Packer DL, Hammill SC, Shen WK, Gersh BJ|title=Long-term progression and outcomes with aging in patients with lone atrial fibrillation: a 30-year follow-up study|journal=Circulation|volume=115|issue=24|pages=3050–6|year=2007|pmid=17548732|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.644484}}</ref> The incidence of stroke associated with AF is 3 to 5 percent per year in the absence of anticoagulation, which is significantly higher compared to the general population without AF (relative risk 2.4 in men and 3.0 in women).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wolf|first1=PA|last2=Kannel|first2=WB|last3=McGee|first3=DL ''et al.''|year=1983|title=Duration of atrial fibrillation and imminence of stroke: The Framingham Study|url=|journal=Stroke|volume=14|issue=|page=664}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Frost|first1=L|last2=Engholm|first2=G|last3=Johnsen|first3=S|year=2000|title=Incident stroke after discharge from the hospital with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation|url=|journal=Am J Med|volume=108|issue=1|doi=10.1016/S0002-9343(99)00415-5|pmid=11059439|last4=Møller|first4=H|last5=Husted|first5=S|pages=36–40}}</ref> A [[systematic review]] of risk factors for stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF concluded that a prior history of stroke or TIA is the most powerful risk factor for future stroke, followed by advancing age, hypertension, and diabetes.<ref name="pmid17679673">{{cite journal|author=|author1=Stroke Risk in Atrial Fibrillation Working Group|title=Independent predictors of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation: a systematic review|journal=Neurology|volume=69|issue=6|pages=546–54|year=2007|pmid=17679673|doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000267275.68538.8d}}</ref> For patients with LAF, the risk of stroke is very low and is independent of whether the LAF was an isolated episode, paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent.<ref name="pmid3627174">{{cite journal|author=Kopecky SL, Gersh BJ, McGoon MD, ''et al.''|title=The natural history of lone atrial fibrillation.

In young patients with few risk factors and no structural heart defect, the benefits of anticoagulation may be outweighed by the risks of [[hemorrhage]] (bleeding). Those at a low risk may benefit from mild (and low-risk) anticoagulation with [[aspirin]] (or [[clopidogrel]] in those who are allergic to aspirin). In contrast, those with a high risk of stroke derive most benefit from [[anticoagulant]] treatment with [[warfarin]] or similar drugs.

More recently, the 2010 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines have recommended a risk factor based approach to stroke prevention, and de-emphasised the artificial stratification into low/moderate/high risk, given the poor predictive value of these 3 categories.

To compensate for the increased risk of stroke, anticoagulants may be required. However, in the case of warfarin, if someone with AF has a yearly risk of stroke that is less than 2%, then the risks associated with taking warfarin outweigh the risk of getting a stroke from AF.<ref>{{cite journal|author=van Walraven C, Hart RG, Singer DE, ''et al.''|title=Oral anticoagulants vs aspirin in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: an individual patient meta-analysis|journal=JAMA|year=2002|volume=288|issue=19|pages=2441&ndash;48|doi=10.1001/jama.288.19.2441|pmid=12435257}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Gage BF, Cardinalli AB, Owens D.|title=Cost-effectiveness of preference-based antithrombotic therapy for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation|journal=Stroke|date=1 June 1998|volume=29|pages=1083&ndash;91|url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/29/6/1083|pmid=9626276|issue=6|doi=10.1161/01.STR.29.6.1083}}</ref> However, since these older data, there is now greater recognition of the importance of good anticoagulation control (as reflected by time in therapeutic range) as well as greater awareness of bleeding risk factors as well as data from recent trials that aspirin carries a similar rate of major bleeding to warfarin, especially in the elderly.<ref>Mant J, Hobbs FD, Fletcher K, Roalfe A, Fitzmaurice D, Lip GY, Murray E; BAFTA investigators; Midland Research Practices Network (MidReC).

===Acute anticoagulation===
If anticoagulation is required urgently (e.g. for cardioversion), [[heparin]] or similar drugs achieve the required level of protection much quicker than warfarin, which will take several days to reach adequate levels.

In the initial stages after an embolic stroke, anticoagulation may be risky, as the damaged area of the brain is relatively prone to bleeding (hemorrhagic transformation).<ref name="pmid17204681">{{cite journal|author=Paciaroni M, Agnelli G, Micheli S, Caso V|title=Efficacy and safety of anticoagulant treatment in acute cardioembolic stroke: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials|journal=Stroke|volume=38|issue=2|pages=423–30|year=2007|pmid=17204681|doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000254600.92975.1f}} [http://www.acpjc.org/Content/147/1/issue/ACPJC-2007-147-1-017.htm ACP JC synopsis ]</ref> As a result, a [[clinical practice guideline]] by [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] recommends that anticoagulation should begin two weeks after stroke if no hemorrhage occurred.<ref name=nice/>

Warfarin treatment requires frequent (usually monthly) monitoring with a blood test resulting in a standardized number known as [[Prothrombin time|international normalized ratio]] (INR), often referred to by clinicians as "pro-time"; this determines whether the correct dose is being used. In AF, the usual target INR is between 2.0 and 3.0 (a higher target, INR between 2.5 and 3.5, is used in patients with prior [[thromboembolism]], [[rheumatic heart disease]], and mechanical [[artificial heart valve]]s, many of whom may also have AF). A high INR may indicate increased bleeding risk, while a low INR would indicate that there is insufficient protection from stroke.

An attempt was made to find a better method of implementing warfarin therapy without the inconvenience of regular monitoring and risk of intracranial hemorrhage. A combination of aspirin and fixed-dose warfarin (initial INR 1.2-1.5) was tried. Unfortunately, in a study of AF patients with additional risk factors for thromboembolism, the combination of aspirin and the lower dose of warfarin was significantly inferior to the standard adjusted-dose warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0), yet still had a similar risk of intracranial hemorrhage.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Adjusted-dose warfarin versus low-intensity, fixed-dose warfarin plus aspirin for high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation: Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation III randomised clinical trial|journal=Lancet|volume=348|issue=9028|pages=633–638|year=1996|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673696034873/abstract|pmid=8782752|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(96)03487-3}}</ref>

===Elderly patients===
The very elderly (patients aged 75&nbsp;years or more) may benefit from anticoagulation provided that their anticoagulation does not increase hemorrhagic complications, which is a difficult goal.

===Left atrial appendage occlusion===
[[Left atrial appendage occlusion]] is an experimental alternative to anticoagulants. During [[cardiac catheterization]], a device (such as the [[Watchman device]]) consisting of an expandable [[nitinol]] frame is introduced into the [[left atrial appendage]], the source of blood clots in more than 90% of cases.<ref name="pmid16644311">{{cite journal|author=Fountain RB, Holmes DR, Chandrasekaran K, ''et al.''|title=The PROTECT AF (WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic PROTECTion in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation) trial|journal=Am.

The left atrial appendage can also be surgically amputated, [[surgical suture|sutured]] or [[surgical stapler|stapled]] simultaneous with other cardiac procedures such as the [[maze procedure]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}} or during [[mitral valve]] surgery.<ref name="pmid12514671">{{cite journal|author=Crystal E, Lamy A, Connolly SJ, ''et al.''|title=Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Study (LAAOS): a randomized clinical trial of left atrial appendage occlusion during routine coronary artery bypass graft surgery for long-term stroke prevention|journal=Am.

==Rate control versus rhythm control using drugs==
AF can cause disabling and annoying symptoms. [[Palpitations]], angina, lassitude (weariness), and decreased exercise tolerance are related to rapid heart rate and inefficient cardiac output caused by AF. Furthermore, AF with a persistent rapid rate can cause a form of [[heart failure]] called [[tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy]]. This can significantly increase mortality and morbidity, which can be prevented by early and adequate treatment of the AF.

There are two ways to approach these symptoms using drugs: rate control and rhythm control. ''Rate control'' seeks to reduce the heart rate to one that is closer to normal, usually 60 to 100&nbsp;bpm, without trying to convert to a regular rhythm. ''Rhythm control'' seeks to restore with cardioversion the regular heart rhythm and maintain it with drugs. Studies suggest that rhythm control is mainly a concern in newly diagnosed AF, while rate control is more important in the chronic phase. Rate control with anticoagulation is as effective a treatment as rhythm control in long term mortality studies, the AFFIRM Trial.<ref name=pmid12466506>{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa021328|author=Wyse DG, Waldo AL, DiMarco JP, Domanski MJ, Rosenberg Y, Schron EB, Kellen JC, Greene HL, Mickel MC, Dalquist JE, Corley SD|title=A comparison of rate control and rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation|journal=N Engl J Med|year=2002|pages=1825–33|volume=347|issue=23|pmid=12466506}}</ref>

The AFFIRM study showed no difference in risk of stroke in patients who have converted to a normal rhythm with antiarrhythmic treatment, compared to those who have only rate control.<ref name=pmid12466506/> AF is associated with a reduced quality of life, and while some studies indicate that rhythm control leads to a higher quality of life, the AFFIRM study did not find a difference.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Thrall G, Lane D, Carroll D, Lip GY|title=Quality of life in patients with atrial fibrillation: a systematic review|journal=Am. J. Med.|volume=119|issue=5|pages=448.e1–19|year=2006|pmid=16651058|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2005.10.057}}</ref>

A further study focused on rhythm control in patients with AF and simultaneous heart failure, based on the premise that AF confers a higher mortality risk in heart failure. In this setting, too, rhythm control offered no advantage compared to rate control.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Roy D, Talajic M, Nattel S, ''et al.''|title=Rhythm control versus rate control for atrial fibrillation and heart failure|journal=N Engl J Med|year=2008|volume=358|pmid=18565859|issue=25|pages=2667–2677|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0708789}}</ref>

In patients with a fast ventricular response, intravenous [[magnesium]] significantly increases the chances of successful rate and rhythm control in the urgent setting without significant side-effects.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Onalan O, Crystal E, Daoulah A, Lau C, Crystal A, Lashevsky I|title=Meta-analysis of magnesium therapy for the acute management of rapid atrial fibrillation|journal=Am. J. Cardiol.|volume=99|issue=12|pages=1726–32|year=2007|pmid=17560883|doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2007.01.057}}</ref>

==Cardioversion==
[[Cardioversion]] is a noninvasive conversion of an irregular heartbeat to a normal heartbeat using electrical or chemical means:<ref name="pmid16908781"/>
* ''Electrical cardioversion'' involves the restoration of normal heart rhythm through the application of a DC electrical shock.
* ''Chemical cardioversion'' is performed with drugs, such as [[amiodarone]], [[dronedarone]],<ref>{{cite journal|author=Singh BN, Connolly SJ, Crijns HJ, ''et al.''|title=Dronedarone for maintenance of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation or flutter|journal=N. Engl. J. Med.|volume=357|issue=10|pages=987–99|year=2007|pmid=17804843|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa054686}}</ref> [[procainamide]], [[ibutilide]], [[propafenone]] or [[flecainide]].

The main risk of cardioversion is systemic embolization of a [[thrombus]] (blood clot) from the previously fibrillating left atrium. Cardioversion should not be performed without adequate anticoagulation in patients with more than 48 hours or unknown duration of AF. Anticoagulation is adequate if warfarin is given with target INR between 2 and 3 for three to four weeks prior to cardioversion, and continued for at least four weeks after cardioversion.<ref>Singer, DE, Albers, GW, Dalen, JE, et al. Antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Chest 2008; 133:546S.</ref> Cardioversion may be performed in instances of AF lasting more than 48&nbsp;hours if a [[transesophogeal echocardiogram]] (TEE) demonstrates no evidence of clot within the heart.<ref name="pmid16908781"/>

Whichever method of cardioversion is used, approximately 50% of patients [[relapse]] within one year, although the continued daily use of oral antiarrhythmic drugs may extend this period. The key risk factor for relapse is duration of AF, although other risk factors that have been identified include the presence of structural heart disease, and increasing age.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Rate control==
Rate control is achieved with medications that work by increasing the degree of block at the level of the AV node, effectively decreasing the number of impulses that conduct down into the ventricles. This can be done with:<ref name="pmid16908781"/><ref name=NICE2006>{{Cite document|first=|last=|coauthors=|contribution=Atrial fibrillation: national clinical guideline for management in primary and secondary care|title=National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions|editor-first=|editor-last=|coeditors=|publisher=Royal College of Physicians|place=London|date=|year=2006|id=|contribution-url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg036fullguideline.pdf}}</ref>

* [[Beta blockers]] (preferably the "cardioselective" beta blockers such as [[metoprolol]], [[atenolol]], [[bisoprolol]])
* [[Calcium channel blocker]]s (i.e. [[diltiazem]] or [[verapamil]])
* [[Cardiac glycosides]] (i.e. [[digoxin]]) - have limited use, apart from in the sedentary elderly patient

In addition to these agents, amiodarone has some AV node blocking effects (particularly when administered intravenously), and can be used in individuals when other agents are contraindicated or ineffective (particularly due to hypotension).

Diltiazem has been shown to be more effective than either digoxin or amiodarone.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Siu CW, Lau CP, Lee WL, Lam KF, Tse HF|title=Intravenous diltiazem is superior to intravenous amiodarone or digoxin for achieving ventricular rate control in patients with acute uncomplicated atrial fibrillation|journal=Crit. Care Med.|volume=37|issue=7|pages=2174–9; quiz 2180|year=2009|pmid=19487941|doi=10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181a02f56|url=}}</ref>

Drugs used to control the rate of AF may cause side effects, especially fatigue and [[dyspnea]]. These are avoided by the more radical "ablate and pace" treatment (see below).

==Maintenance of sinus rhythm==
The mainstay of maintaining sinus rhythm is the use of antiarrhythmic agents. Recently, other approaches have been developed that promise to decrease or eliminate the need for antiarrhythmic agents.

===Antiarrhythmic agents===
The anti-arrhythmic medications often used in either pharmacological cardioversion or in the prevention of relapse to AF alter the flux of ions in heart tissue, making them less excitable, setting the stage for spontaneous and durable cardioversion. The agents work by prolonging the [[Effective Refractory Period]] (ERP) either by blocking sodium ions (Class I drugs) or by blocking potassium ions (Class III drugs) or a mixture of both. These medications are often used in concert with electrical cardioversion.

===Catheter ablation===
In patients with AF where rate control drugs are ineffective and it is not possible to restore sinus rhythm using cardioversion, non-pharmacological alternatives are available. For example, to control rate it is possible to destroy the bundle of cells connecting the upper and lower chambers of the heart - the [[atrioventricular node]] - which regulates heart rate, and to implant a [[artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]] instead. This "ablate and pace" technique has an important place in the treatment of AF<ref>Jonathan Pitts Crick, [http://209.85.135.132/search?q=cache:pu-EO7pmwzAJ:www.atrialfibrillation.org.uk/files/file/PV%2520AFA%2520PACEMAKER%2520AND%2520NODE%2520ABLATION%2520FOR%2520AF%2520090413.pdf+%22Pacemaker+and+Node+Ablation+for+AF%22&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk "Pacemaker and Node Ablation for AF"], Atrial Fibrillation Association, April 2009</ref> as it is the only reliably effective method for relieving the symptoms of the arrhythmia and can be used when other methods have failed (as they do in up to 50% of cases of persistent AF). Although this procedure results in a regular (paced) heart rhythm it does not prevent the atria from fibrillating and therefore long-term warfarin anticoagulation may still be required.

A more complex technique, which avoids the need for a pacemaker, involves ablating groups of cells near the pulmonary veins where AF is thought to originate, or creating more extensive lesions in an attempt to prevent AF from establishing itself.<ref name="pmid16908781"/> The technique has first been suggested by French electrophysiologist [[Michel Haïssaguerre]].

[[Ablation]] ('''AF ablation''') is a method that increasingly is used to treat cases of recurrent AF that are unresponsive to conventional treatments. [[Radiofrequency ablation]] (RFA) uses radiofrequency energy to destroy abnormal electrical pathways in heart tissue. Other energy sources include laser, cryothermy and high intensity ultrasound. The energy emitting probe ([[electrode]]) is placed into the heart through a [[catheter]] inserted into veins in the groin or neck. Electrodes that can detect electrical activity from inside the heart are also inserted, and the electrophysiologist uses these to "map" an area of the heart to locate the abnormal electrical activity before eliminating the responsible tissue. The cardiac catheterization procedure may be performed by hand, or with the help of a robotic catheterization system such as [[Stereotaxis]] remote magnetic navigation (RMN) or the [[Hansen Medical]] [[Sensei robotic catheter system]]. Robotic atrial mapping and ablation procedures allow better visualization and control of the catheter. The Stereotaxis system has shown to have higher efficacy, shorter procedure times and lower complication rates than any other manual or robotic procedure.<ref>Santinelli et al, 2009.

Most AF ablations consist of isolating the electrical pathways from the [[pulmonary vein]]s (PV),<ref>[http://www.clevelandclinic.org/heartcenter/pub/atrial_fibrillation/pulmonaryvein_ablation.htm The Cleveland Clinic]</ref> which are located on the posterior wall of the left atrium, in a procedure known as a '''pulmonary vein ablation''' ('''PV ablation''' or '''PVA'''). All other veins from the body (including neck and groin) lead to the right atrium, so to get to the left atrium the catheters must get across the atrial septum. This is done by piercing a small hole in the septal wall. This is called a transseptal approach. Once in the left atrium, the physician may perform '''wide area circumferential ablation''' (WACA) to electrically isolate the PVs from the left atrium.<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/532503_2 Medscape]</ref>

Some more recent approaches to ablating AF is to target sites that are particularly disorganized in both atria as well as in the [[coronary sinus]] (CS). These sites are termed '''complex fractionated atrial electrogram''' (CFAE) sites.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Nademanee K, McKenzie J, Kosar E, Schwab M, Sunsaneewitayakul B, Vasavakul T, Khunnawat C, Ngarmukos T.|title=A new approach for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation: mapping of the electrophysiologic substrate|journal=J Am Coll Cardiol|year=2004|pages=2044–53|volume=43|issue=11|pmid=15172410|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2003.12.054}}</ref> It is believed by some that the CFAE sites are the cause of AF, or a combination of the PVs and CFAE sites are to blame. New techniques include the use of [[cryoablation]] (tissue freezing using a coolant which flows through the catheter), microwave ablation, where tissue is ablated by the microwave energy "cooking" the adjacent tissue, and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), which destroys tissue by heating. This is an area of active research, especially with respect to the RF ablation technique and emphasis on isolating the pulmonary veins that enter into the left atrium.

Efficacy and risks of catheter ablation of AF are areas of active debate. A worldwide survey of the outcomes of 8745 ablation procedures<ref>{{cite journal|author=Cappato R, Calkins H, Chen SA, Davies W, Iesaka Y, Kalman J, Kim YH, Klein G, Packer D, Skanes A.|title=Worldwide survey on the methods, efficacy, and safety of catheter ablation for human atrial fibrillation|journal=Circulation|year=2005|volume=111|issue=9|pages=1100–1105|pmid=15723973|doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000157153.30978.67}}</ref> demonstrated a 52% success rate (ranging from 14.5% to 76.5% among centers), with an additional 23.9% of patients becoming asymptomatic with addition of an antiarrhythmic medication. In 27.3% of patients, more than one procedure was required to attain these results. There was at least one major complication in 6% of patients. Death has been found to occur in 1 in 1000 people who undergo this procedure.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Cappato R, Calkins H, Chen SA, ''et al.''|title=Prevalence and causes of fatal outcome in catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation|journal=J. Am. Coll. Cardiol.|volume=53|issue=19|pages=1798–803|year=2009|pmid=19422987|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2009.02.022|url=}}</ref> A thorough discussion of results of catheter ablation was published in 2007; it notes that results are widely variable, due in part to differences in technique, follow-up, definitions of success, use of antiarrhythmic therapy, and in experience and technical proficiency.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Calkins H, Brugada J, Packer DL, Cappato R, Chen SA, Crijns HJ, Damiano RJ Jr, Davies DW, Haines DE, Haissaguerre M, Iesaka Y, Jackman W, Jais P, Kottkamp H, Kuck KH, Lindsay BD, Marchlinski FE, McCarthy PM, Mont JL, Morady F, Nademanee K, Natale A, Pappone C, Prystowsky E, Raviele A, Ruskin JN, Shemin RJ.|title=HRS/EHRA/ECAS expert Consensus Statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation: recommendations for personnel, policy, procedures and follow-up.

This relatively low success rate, the significant complications and a lack of long-term (more than 5 years) follow-up data for this operation make the simple "ablate and pace" treatment an attractive option especially for older patients and those who are looking for a definitive procedure to relieve their AF symptoms.

===Cox maze===
The [[Cox maze procedure]] is an open-heart surgical procedure intended to eliminate AF and was first performed at St. Louis' Barnes Hospital—now [[Barnes-Jewish Hospital]]—in 1987. "Maze" refers to the series of incisions made in the atria, which are arranged in a maze-like pattern. The intention was to eliminate AF by using incisional scars to block abnormal electrical circuits (atrial macroreentry) that AF requires. This procedure required an extensive series of endocardial (from the inside of the heart) incisions through both atria, a median sternotomy (vertical incision through the breastbone) and cardiopulmonary bypass (heart-lung machine). A series of improvements were made, culminating in 1992 in the Cox maze III procedure, which is now considered to be the "gold standard" for effective surgical cure of AF. The Cox maze III is sometimes referred to as the "traditional maze", the "cut and sew maze", or simply the "maze".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Cox JL, Schuessler RB, Lappas DG, Boineau JP|title=An 8{{fraction|1|2}}-year clinical experience with surgery for atrial fibrillation|journal=Ann.

===Minimally invasive maze procedures===
[[Minimaze]] procedures are minimally invasive versions of the original [[Cox maze procedure]] but without cardiac incisions. These procedures do not require a median sternotomy (vertical incision in the breastbone) or [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] (heart-lung machine). They use laser, cryothermy, radiofrequency, or acoustic energy to ablate atrial tissue near the pulmonary veins and make other required ablations to mimic the maze.

Minimally invasive surgical ([[endoscopic]]) maze procedures are now routinely conducted at hospitals around the US. This approach was developed in the early 2000s.<ref name='Saltman2003'>{{cite journal|title=A completely endoscopic approach to microwave ablation for atrial fibrillation|journal=The Heart Surgery Forum|year=2003|first=AE|last=Saltman|coauthors=LS Rosenthal, NA Francalancia, SJ Lahey|volume=6|issue=3|pages=E38–41|pmid=12821436|url=http://www.bioingenieria.edu.ar/academica/catedras/radiaciones/ablacionendoscopia.pdf|format=&ndash; <sup>[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=author%3ASaltman+intitle%3AA+completely+endoscopic+approach+to+microwave+ablation+for+atrial+fibrillation&as_publication=The+Heart+Surgery+Forum&as_ylo=2003&as_yhi=2003&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup>|accessdate=2009-02-08}} {{dead link|date=April 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name='rwjHosp'>{{cite web|url=http://www.rwjuh.edu/medical_services/min_invasive_atrial_fibrillation.html|title=Minimally Invasive Atrial Fibrillation Treatment|accessdate=2009-02-08|year=2008|publisher=Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital}}</ref>
