{{flu}}

==Rationale==

There is some evidence from clinical studies that LAIV is more effective than inactivated vaccine in young children.<ref name="cite pmid|17301299">{{cite pmid|17301299}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|19453395}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|22895945}}</ref>

==Risks==

Even though the virus in LAIV is attenuated (low in [[virulence]]), it is still a living virus, and may cause an [[infection]] with complications in people with weakened immune systems or other underlying medical conditions. LAIV is recommended only for people 2–49 years of age, and is not recommended for people who have a weakened immune system, for pregnant women, or for people with certain chronic diseases.<ref>[http://flumist.com/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx FluMist Safety and Eligibility Information]</ref> In contrast, inactivated virus vaccines contain no living virus, and cannot cause a live infection. Persons receiving LAIV may shed small amounts of the vaccine virus during the first week. People coming in contact with the vaccinated person are not considered to be at risk, unless their immune systems are severely weakened (bone marrow transplant recipients).<ref name="cite pmid|18662737"/>

==Source of LAIV==

[[MedImmune]] is one company that manufactures LAIV, which it sells under the trade name "FluMist" in the United States and "Fluenz"<ref name="ema.europa.eu"/> in [[Europe]]. For the 2010–2011 flu season, FluMist was the only LAIV approved by the FDA for use in the USA.<ref name="fda-approval-lists" /> All other FDA-approved lots were inactivated virus vaccines. In September 2009 a LAIV intransal vaccine for the novel H1N1 influenza virus was approved<ref name="CDC-AH1N1"/> and the seasonal intranasal vaccine was approved by the [[European Medicines Agency]] for use in the [[European Union]] in 2011, though distribution will not likely begin until 2012.<ref name="foxbusiness"/>

==Groups for whom FluMist is recommended==

In Canada, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), the group that advises the Public Health Agency of Canada, currently recommends that everyone aged 2 to 64 years be encouraged to receive annual influenza vaccination, and that children between the age of 6 and 24 months, and their household contacts, should be considered a high priority for the flu vaccine.<ref name="CTV" />

In February 2008, the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]] (ACIP) recommended vaccination for all children and teenagers between six months and 18 years of age.<ref name="CTV">{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080227/flu_shot_080226/20080227|title=U.S. panel recommends all kids get the flu shot|date=2008-02-27|publisher=CTV.ca|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref>

In 2007, FluMist received additional approval from the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) extending the age groups it is approved for, to include healthy children two years old and onward.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2007/NEW01705.html FDA Approves Nasal Influenza Vaccine for Use in Younger Children</ref> And the CDC's [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]] (ACIP), endorsed the needle-free vaccine as a good option for healthy (non-asthmatic) children aged 2 through 4 years.<ref>[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/general/news/oct2507acip.html CIDRAP >> ACIP endorses FluMist for 2-, 3-, and 4-year-olds]</ref> This extended approval supplemented approvals for children over four years of age that were already effective. The sum of these approvals is that FluMist is approved and recommended from the child's 25th month through the adult's 49th year of age.

FluMist is currently recommended for all healthy persons at least two years old and under 50 years of age wishing to protect themselves from [[influenza]] and its complications, or to avoid spreading the flu to members of certain vulnerable groups:

<blockquote>"All healthy, non-pregnant persons age 49 yrs and younger who want to reduce the likelihood of becoming ill with influenza, or of spreading it to others who meet any of the criteria listed below:</blockquote>
<blockquote> -Working or living with at-risk people as listed in the section above.</blockquote>
<blockquote> -Healthcare personnel or other persons who provide direct care to at-risk people (except persons in close contact with severely immunosuppressed persons).</blockquote>
<blockquote> -Household contacts and out-of-home caregivers of children age 0–59m.</blockquote>
<blockquote> -Travelers who may be among people from areas of the world where there is current influenza activity (e.g., on organized tours).</blockquote>
<blockquote> -Students or other persons in institutional settings (e.g., dormitory residents)." <ref>http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2011.pdf Summary of Recommendations for Adult Immunization linked from CDC website http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/adult-schedule.htm#print</ref>
</blockquote>

For comparison, only [[Sanofi-Aventis]]'s injectable influenza vaccine is approved for children 7 months of age and older; FluMist is approved after the second year, and other injectable vaccines from four years of age onward. Injectable influenza vaccine approvals have no upper age limit, while FluMist has not yet been tested or presented for FDA approval for use by persons 50 or older.

Within the age groups they are approved for, injectable vaccines do occasionally present mild side effects such as soreness, redness, swelling, fever, and aches, and FluMist sometimes causes brief and mild symptoms such as a runny nose. Side effects of both FluMist and injected vaccines tend to be slightly more prevalent the first year, and to diminish with vaccinations given in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ohmit SE, Gross J, Victor JC, Monto AS |title=Reduced Reaction Frequencies with Repeated Inactivated or Live-attenuated Influenza Vaccination |journal=Vaccine |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=1050–4 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19095028 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.11.100 |pmc=2665993}}</ref>

Tests against injected (killed virus) vaccinations have shown that FluMist is more effective than needle shots in preventing influenza, especially in children aged 6 to 17<ref name ="MedicalNews">[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/general/news/nov1706asthma.html FluMist More Effective Than Injections For Small Children And Babies]. ''Medical News Today''. 1 May 2006.</ref><ref name="R&D Focus Drug News">'FluMist MedImmune clinical data (phase III) (influenza).' R&D Focus Drug News 30 January 2006.</ref>
but one smaller study in adults showed lower effectiveness against influenza B viruses in adults.<ref name="cbs">[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/13/ap/health/mainD8M07HM80.shtml Study: Flu Shots Better Than FluMist]. cbsnews.com. 13 December 2006.</ref>

In past years when flu vaccine has been in short supply, healthy people were requested to abstain from vaccination early in the season, to leave the limited supply for the most vulnerable groups. Flu vaccine supplies are now abundant, and since healthy people benefit from vaccination they are now encouraged to protect themselves and others by being vaccinated.

The 2007 recommendations by the US [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]] (ACIP) include six principal changes or updates.  These stress that all persons who want to reduce the risk of becoming ill with influenza or of transmitting influenza to others should be vaccinated, and that young children not previously vaccinated should be vaccinated twice, and include these specific recommendations:

    <blockquote>ACIP reiterates a previous recommendation that all persons, including school-aged children, who want to reduce the risk of becoming ill with influenza or of transmitting influenza to others should be vaccinated (see Box and Recommendations for Using TIV and LAIV During the 2007--08 Influenza Season).</blockquote>

    <blockquote>ACIP emphasizes that immunization providers should offer influenza vaccine and schedule immunization clinics throughout the influenza season (see Timing of Vaccination).</blockquote>

    <blockquote>ACIP recommends that health-care administrators consider the level of vaccination coverage among health-care personnel (HCP) to be one measure of a patient safety quality program and implement policies to encourage HCP vaccination (e.g., obtaining signed statements from HCP who decline influenza vaccination) (see Additional Information Regarding Vaccination of Specific Populations).<ref>Primary Changes and Updates in the Recommendations (2007) http://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5606a1.htm</ref></blockquote>
</blockquote>

In 2000, a study found FluMist be well tolerated in 57 adults with asymptomatic HIV and median CD4 counts of 541.<ref>{{cite journal |author=King JC, Treanor J, Fast PE, ''et al.'' |title=Comparison of the safety, vaccine virus shedding, and immunogenicity of influenza virus vaccine, trivalent, types A and B, live cold-adapted, administered to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and non-HIV-infected adults |journal=J.

However, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control state clearly that people with HIV/AIDS should not receive FluMist <ref>Seasonal Influenza (Flu): HIV/AIDS and the Flu http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/hiv-flu.htm</ref> and that advice is augmented by the suggestion that close household contacts or caregivers of severely immunocompromised individuals should not receive FluMist due to transmission risks from individuals immunized with FluMist.

The vaccine was approved for use in the European Union by the European Medicines Agency in 2011. Marketing approval in Europe, where it will be called Fluenz, is for the prevention of seasonal influenza in children aged from two to less than 18 years,<ref name="ema.europa.eu"/> though distribution will not likely begin until 2012.<ref name="foxbusiness" />

==Groups for whom FluMist is not recommended==

*People less than 2 years of age<ref name="QandA" />
*People 50 years of age and over<ref name="QandA" />
*People with a medical condition that places them at high risk for complications from influenza, including those with chronic heart or lung disease, such as asthma or reactive airways disease
*People with medical conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure or people with illnesses that weaken the immune system, or who take medications that can weaken the immune system
*Children less than 5 years old with a history of recurrent wheezing
*Children or adolescents receiving aspirin
*People with a history of [[Guillain-Barré syndrome]], a rare disorder of the nervous system
*Pregnant women
*People who have a severe allergy to chicken eggs or who are allergic to any of the nasal spray vaccine components<ref name="QandA" />

It is possible for individuals vaccinated with FluMist to spread the virus to others for up to 21 days after vaccination.  For this reason it is recommended that those vaccinated with FluMist avoid close contact with individuals with weak immune systems during that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vaccineinfo.net/immunization/vaccine/influenza/flumist_vaccine_risks.shtml|title=Risks of FluMist Vaccine}}</ref>

==Testing pandemic FluMist variants==
FluMist is designed to be quickly modifiable to present the surface antigens of seasonal flu.  The modifiability could also allow it to be quickly customized as a vaccine against a pandemic influenza if one were to emerge.  In light of the [[Global spread of H5N1]] advance preparation to reduce [[Human mortality from H5N1|human mortality in the event of an H5N1 pandemic]] has begun.  Modifying FluMist to serve as a specific human H5N1 vaccine is among the measures studied.<ref>See, e.g., http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no01/05-1147-G.htm | Volume 12, Number 1, January 2006

In June 2006, the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) began enrolling participants in a [[H5N1 clinical trials|Phase 1 H5N1 study]] of an intranasal [[influenza vaccine]] candidate based on [[MedImmune]]'s live, attenuated vaccine technology.<ref>[http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=83037&p=irol-newsArticle_Print&ID=872852&highlight= MedImmune] Press release ''MedImmune and National Institutes of Health Begin Clinical Testing of a Live, Attenuated Intranasal Vaccine Against an H5N1 Avian Influenza Virus'' published June 15, 2006</ref>

In September 2006 the NIH [[NIAID]] reported that inoculation with a FluMist vaccine modified to present the surface antigens of certain H5N1 variants provided broad protection against other H5N1 variants in the mouse and ferret models.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Suguitan AL, McAuliffe J, Mills KL, ''et al.'' |title=Live, attenuated influenza A H5N1 candidate vaccines provide broad cross-protection in mice and ferrets |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=e360 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16968127 |pmc=1564176 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030360}}</ref> Attenuated live viruses were found protective against H5N1 in mice and chickens in a 2009 study.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Steel J, Lowen AC, Pena L, ''et al.'' |title=Live attenuated influenza viruses containing NS1 truncations as vaccine candidates against H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza |journal=J.

Although early work is focusing on the looming H5N1 threat, the CDC team led by Kanta Subbarao and others intends to eventually prepare and store surface antigens for all known strains of influenza, ready to be grafted onto the base attenuated FluMist core virus whenever a pandemic threat might emerge.

"Several trials have reported that LAIVs can boost virus-specific CTLs as well as mucosal and serum antibodies and provide broad cross-protection against heterologous human influenza A viruses."

==History==

FluMist was originally developed by Hunein "John" Maassab, Professor of Epidemiology at the [[University of Michigan]] School of Public Health in [[Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]] and later by Aviron, in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[California]], under the sponsorship of NIH in the mid-1990s. [[MedImmune]], Inc. purchased Aviron in 2002, and the FDA approved FluMist in June 2003.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2004-01-07-flumist_x.htm|title=Nasal FluMist overcomes obstacles to reach public|last=Appleby|first=Julie|date=2004-01-07|work=USA Today|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref> FluMist was first made available in September 2003.

The U.S. FDA initially approved FluMist only for healthy people ages 5 to 49 because of concerns over possible side effects. Now FluMist is approved and recommended for healthy children 24 months of age and older. The FDA approved the current unfrozen refrigerated version for the same age group (ages 5–49) in August 2006 following completion of phase 3 clinical trials.<ref name="Drug Week">{{cite news|url=http://www.newsrx.com/newsletters/Lab-Law-Weekly/2006-08-25/08212006333927LL.html|title=MedImmune begins shipping live intranasal flu vaccine for 2006-2007 after U.S. FDA release|date=2006-08-25|work=Lab Law Weekly|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref>
CAIV-T has been approved by the FDA and is the version offered on the market beginning in fall of 2007.

The current version of the vaccine is called CAIV-T, and is stable for storage in a refrigerator, rather than requiring freezer storage as did the originally-approved formulation.  Approved for the 2007-2008 flu season, the refrigerated formulation can be distributed more economically, so that the price differential with shots (which had hampered sales of the original frozen version of FluMist) is now largely eliminated. FluMist was initially priced higher than the injectable vaccines, but sold only 500,000 of the 4 million doses it produced its first year on the market, despite a comparative shortage of flu vaccine in fall 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A51955-2005Jan5|title=FluMist Sales Falling Short, Survey Finds|last=Rosenwald|first=Michael|date=2005-01-06|work=[[The Washington Post]]|page=E05|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref> The price was sharply lowered the next year, and the company reports distributing 1.6 million doses in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsrx.com/issue_article/Pharma-Business-Week/2006-02-27/02272006333154PB.html|title=MedImmune reports revenues of $1.2 billion|date=2006-02-27|work=Pharma Business Week|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref> Because of the price drop, despite selling almost three times as many doses in 2005, the company reported $21 million in FluMist sales, compared to $48 million the previous year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/02/AR2006020202320.html|title=Sales of MedImmune's Flu Vaccine Drop Sharply|last=Rosenwald|first=Michael|date=2006-02-03|work=[[The Washington Post]]|page=D04|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref> Further cuts in pricing had to await FDA approval of a refrigerator-cooled FluMist formulation, as the initial formulation required freezer storage and thawing on demand before administration. Although it is positioned as a premium product, the remaining price premium for FluMist over the cost of needle-injected vaccine is small.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The FDA's regulatory pathway for FluMist has been suggested as a possible precedent for [[phage therapy]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.3389/fmicb.2012.00238}}</ref>
