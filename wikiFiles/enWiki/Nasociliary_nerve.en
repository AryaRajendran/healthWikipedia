The '''nasociliary nerve''' is a branch of the [[ophthalmic nerve]].  It is intermediate in size between the two other main branches of the ophthalmic nerve, the [[frontal nerve]] and the [[lacrimal nerve]], and is more deeply placed. 

==Path==
The '''nasociliary nerve''' enters the orbit between the two heads of the [[lateral rectus muscle]]s and between the superior and inferior rami of the [[oculomotor nerve]] (CN III).  It passes across the [[optic nerve]] (CN II) and runs obliquely beneath the [[superior rectus muscle]] and [[superior oblique muscle]] to the medial wall of the [[orbital cavity]].  It passes through the anterior ethmoidal opening as the anterior ethmoidal nerve and enters the cranial cavity just above the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. It supplies branches to the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity and finally emerges between the inferior border of the nasal bone and the side nasal cartilages as the external nasal branch.

==Tests==
Since both the short and long ciliary nerves carry the afferent limb of the corneal [[blink reflex]], one can test the integrity of the nasociliary nerve (and, ultimately, the [[trigeminal nerve]]) by examining this reflex in the patient. Normally both eyes should blink when either cornea (not the conjunctiva, which is supplied by the adjacent cutaneous nerves) is irritated. If neither eye blinks, then either the ipsilateral nasociliary nerve is damaged, or the [[facial nerve]] (CN VII, which carries the efferent limb of this reflex) is bilaterally damaged. If only the contralateral eye blinks, then the ipsilateral facial nerve is damaged. If only the ipsilateral eye blinks, then the contralateral facial nerve is damaged.

==Branches==
The nasociliary nerve gives off the following branches:
* [[posterior ethmoidal nerve]]
* [[long ciliary nerve]]s
* [[infratrochlear nerve]]
* [[long root of the ciliary ganglion|communicating branch to the ciliary ganglion]] (long root of the ciliary ganglion)
* [[anterior ethmoidal nerve]]

''PLICA'' is a mnemonic often used to remember these branches.
