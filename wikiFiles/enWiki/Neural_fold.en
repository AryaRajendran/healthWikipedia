The '''neural fold''' is a structure that arises during [[neurulation]] in the embryonic development of both [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s among other organisms.<ref name="gilbert">{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Scott F.|title=Developmental biology|year=2010|publisher=Sinauer Associates|location=Sunderland, Mass.|isbn=0878933840|edition=9th ed.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Colas|first=Jean-François|coauthors=Schoenwolf, Gary C.|title=Towards a cellular and molecular understanding of neurulation|journal=Developmental Dynamics|date=1|year=2001|month=June|volume=221|issue=2|pages=117–145|doi=10.1002/dvdy.1144|accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref> This structure is associated with [[Neurulation#Primary_neurulation|primary neurulation]], meaning that it forms by the coming together of tissue layers, rather than a clustering, and subsequent hollowing out, of individual cells (known as [[Neurulation#Secondary_neurulation|secondary neurulation]]).  In humans, the neural folds are responsible for the formation of the [[anterior]] end of the [[neural tube]].  The neural folds are derived from the [[neural plate]], a preliminary structure consisting of elongated [[ectoderm]] cells.  The folds give rise to [[neural crest|neural crest cells]], as well as bringing about the formation of the [[neural tube]].<ref name="gilbert"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Yamaguchi|first=Y|coauthors=Miura, M|title=How to form and close the brain: insight into the mechanism of cranial neural tube closure in mammals.|journal=Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS|date=15|year=2012|month=December|pages=1–16|pmid=23242429|accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref>

==Origin==
In the embryo, the formation of the neural folds originates from the area where the [[neural plate]] and the surrounding [[ectoderm]] converge. This region of the embryo is formed after [[gastrulation]], and consists of epithelial tissue.  Here, the epithelial cells elongate by means of [[microtubule]] polymerization, increasing their height.  The thumbnail below shows this process, as well as the subsequent formation of the neural crest cells and the neural tube, which arise from the joining of the neural folds.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lawson|first=A|coauthors=Anderson, H; Schoenwolf, GC|title=Cellular mechanisms of neural fold formation and morphogenesis in the chick embryo.|journal=The Anatomical record|date=2001 Feb 1|volume=262|issue=2|pages=153–68|pmid=11169910}}</ref>

==Folding mechanism==

[[File:Embryonic Development CNS.gif|thumb|left|upright=1.3| A strip of specialized cells called the [[notochord]] (A) induces the cells of the [[ectoderm]] directly above it to become the primitive nervous system (i.e., neuroepithelium). The [[neuroepithelium]] then folds over (B). As the tips of the folds fuse together, a hollow tube (the [[neural tube]]) forms (C)—the precursor of the brain and spinal cord. Meanwhile, the [[ectoderm]] and [[endoderm]] continue to curve around and fuse to create the body cavity, completing the transformation of the embryo from a flattened disk to a three–dimensional body. Cells originating from the fused tips of the [[neuroectoderm]] ([[neural crest cells]]) migrate to various locations throughout the embryo, where they will initiate the development of diverse body structures (D).<ref>{{cite web|title=File:Embryonic Development CNS.gif|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Embryonic_Development_CNS.gif|work=Wikimedia Commons|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref>]]

The formation of the neural fold is initiated by the release of [[calcium]] from within the cells.  The released calcium interacts with proteins that can modify the [[actin]] filaments in the outer epithelial tissue, or ectoderm, in order to induce the dynamic cell movements necessary to create the fold.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ferreira|first=MC|coauthors=Hilfer, SR|title=Calcium regulation of neural fold formation: visualization of the actin cytoskeleton in living chick embryos.|journal=Developmental biology|date=1993 Oct|volume=159|issue=2|pages=427–40|pmid=8405669}}</ref>  These cells are held together by [[cadherin]]s (specifically E and N-cadherin), types of intercellular binding protein.  When the cells at the peaks of the neural folds come in proximity with each other, it is the affinity for similar [[cadherin]] molecules (N-cadherins) that allows these cells to bind to each other.  Thus, when the neural tube precursor cells begin expressing N-cadherin in the place of E-cadherin, this causes the neural tube to form and separate from the ectoderm and settle inside the embryo.<ref name="gilbert" />  When the cells fail to associate in a manner that is not part of the normal course of development, severe [[Neural_fold#Diseases|diseases]] can occur.

===Process overview===
The process of folding begins when the cells in the central region of the neural plate, the medial hinge point (MHP) cells, bind to the [[notochord]] beneath them.  This creates a central anchoring point for the process of folding to occur, and subsequently creates the [[neural groove]].  As the neural folds continue to extend, dorsolateral hinge points (DLHP) form, allowing the folds to curve into a tube-like structure.  When the peaks of the folds (known as the neural crest regions) touch, they merge and involute, creating the neural tube beneath the newly formed epidermal layer.<ref>{{cite book|title=Developmental biology protocols, Volume 136|year=2000|publisher=Humama|pages=125–134|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dMZ0NOZUyxEC&pg=PA125#v=onepage&q&f=false|authorlink=Mechanisms of Neurulation|editor=Rocky S. Tuan, Cecilia W. Lo|accessdate=1 April 2013|chapter=15}}</ref>

===Mechanism===
[[Image:Gray16.png|thumb|Cross section through the embryonic disc showing the fold.]]
The molecular mechanism behind this process lies in the expression and repression of bone morphogenic proteins.  [[bone morphogenic protein|Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs)]] are a wide family of proteins that perform many functions throughout the growing embryo, including stimulating the growth of cartilage and bone.  In order to allow for the growth of precursor neural tissues, as opposed to precursor bone or cartilage tissues, BMP expression is decreased in the neural plate, specifically along the medial line, where the neural groove will soon form.
The proteins produced from the genes ''Noggin'' and ''Chordin'' inhibit these BMPs, and subsequently allow neural commitment genes, like ''Sox'', to be expressed.  These genes encode [[transcription factor]]s, which alter the genomic expression of these cells, furthering them along the path of neural cell commitment.<ref name="keeling">{{cite book|last=Khong|first=Hrsg. Jean W. Keeling; Hrsg. T. Yee|title=Fetal and Neonatal Pathology|year=2007|publisher=Springer London|location=Goldaming|isbn=978-1846285240|pages=702–704|edition=4., Ed.}}</ref>
This process of BMP inhibition allows for the anchoring of the medial hinge point cells, providing the  neural folds with the foundation necessary for folding and closure to occur.  ''Noggin'' and ''Chordin'' have other roles in the neurulation process, including stimulating the neural crest cells to emigrate from the newly formed neural tube.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=RM|coauthors=Stottmann RW, Choi M, Klingensmith J.|title=Endogenous bone morphogenetic protein antagonists regulate mammalian neural crest generation and survival.|journal=Developmental Dynamics|year=2006|month=September|volume=235|issue=9|pages=2507–20|pmid=16894609|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.proxy.bc.edu/pubmed/?term=Endogenous+BMP+antagonists+regulate+mammalian+neural+crest+generation+and+survival|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Stottmann|first=Rolf W.|coauthors=Mark Berrong, Karen Matta, Murim Choi, John Klingensmith|title=The BMP antagonist Noggin promotes cranial and spinal neurulation by distinct mechanisms|journal=Developmental Biology|date=15|year=2006|month=July|volume=295|issue=2|pages=647–663|pmid=PMC3001110|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3001110/|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref> 
The ''[[Sonic hedgehog]]'' gene also plays a role in attenuating BMP expression, forming the medial hinge point while inhibiting the formation of the dorsolateral hinge points, and in ensuring the proper closure of the neural folds.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kirillova|first=I|coauthors=Novikova I, Augé J, Audollent S, Esnault D, Encha-Razavi F, Lazjuk G, Attié-Bitach T, Vekemans M.|title=Expression of the sonic hedgehog gene in human embryos with neural tube defects.|journal=Teratology|year=2000|month=May|volume=61|issue=5|pages=347–54|pmid=10777830|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10777830|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref>
The prechordal plate, notochord, and non-neural ectoderm are believed to be important inducer tissues which release these chemical signals, in order to trigger neural plate folding.<ref name="keeling" />

The final adhesion of the converging neural folds is due to several different types of intercellular binding proteins.  [[Cadherin]]s and their CAM receptor molecules, for example, are present in two types in the neural precursor tissue: E-cadherin keeps the cells of the neural plate and surrounding ectoderm adhered to each other, while N-cadherin does the same for the cells of the neural fold.  Only cells expressing the same kind of cadherin can bind to each other; since the peaks of the neural folds both express N-cadherin, they are able to merge into a continuous sheet of cells.  Likewise, it is this diminished affinity between cells expressing different types of cadherin that allows the neural tube precursor cells to separate from the ectoderm, forming the neural tube on the interior of the embryo and the true epidermis on the exterior.<ref name="gilbert" />
Another set of molecules involved with the merging of the neural folds are the ephrin molecules and their Eph receptors, which adhere in a similar manner to the cadherin molecules discussed above.<ref name="keeling" />

===Derivative structures===
The merging of the neural folds gives rise to many structures including: the neural tube (the precursor to the [[central nervous system]]), [[neural crest|neural crest cells]](which give rise to a variety of diverse [[mesenchymal]] cells), and to the true [[epidermis (skin)|epidermal layer]].<ref name="gilbert" /> The neural fold is an extremely important structure in that this mechanism is needed to produce these diverse kinds of cells in the right places.

==Diseases==

{{Main|Neural tube defect}}
There are many potential diseases that can arise from the improper adhesion or merging of the neural folds.  During folding, the openings that are formed at the [[Anatomical terms of location#Anterior and posterior|cranial]] and [[Anatomical terms of location#Anterior and posterior|caudal]] regions are termed the cranial and caudal neuropores.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=SF|title=Developmental Biology|year=2000|publisher=Sinauer Associates|location=Sunderland, MA|isbn=978-0-87893-243-6|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10080/#A2877|edition=6|accessdate=30 November 2011|chapter=12: Formation of the Neural Tube}}</ref> If the caudal neuropore fails to close, a condition called [[spina bifida]] can occur, in which the bottom of the spinal cord remains exposed.  Often this condition can be detected during [[prenatal care|prenatal examinations]] and be treated before birth, though in more severe cases the individual may cope with the condition for the rest of his or her life.<ref name="Kids Health">{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/system/ill/spina_bifida.html#|title=Spina Bifida|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref>  Depending on the severity and the affected area, individuals can experience a variety of symptoms, including a varying motor function and mobility, bladder control, and/or sexual function.<ref name="Spina Bifida Association">{{cite web|title=SB and the Spine|url=http://www.spinabifidaassociation.org/site/c.evKRI7OXIoJ8H/b.8029551/k.99AA/Learn_about_SB.htm|work=Learn about Spina Bifida|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref>  

If the failure is instead in the cranial neuropore, [[anencephaly]] occurs.  In this condition, the brain tissue is directly exposed to the [[amniotic fluid]], and is subsequently degraded.<ref>{{cite web|title=7.2: The trilaminar germ disk (3rd week)|url=http://www.embryology.ch/anglais/hdisqueembry/triderm10.html|work=Human Embryology: Embryogenesis|accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref>  
If the entire neural tube fails to close, the condition is referred to as [[Rachischisis|craniorachischisis]].
