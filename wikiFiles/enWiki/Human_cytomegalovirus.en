==CMV diseases==
CMV infections are most significant in the perinatal period and in immunocompromised patients.

===Pregnancy and congenital infection===
{{main|Congenital cytomegalovirus infection}}
HCMV is one of the [[TORCH infections]] that lead to congenital abnormalities. These are: [[Toxoplasmosis]], [[Rubella]], Cytomegalovirus and [[Herpes simplex]]. Congenital HCMV infection occurs when the mother suffers a primary infection or reactivation during pregnancy.

Up to 5/1000 live births are infected. 5% develop multiple handicaps, and develop cytomegalic inclusion disease with nonspecific signs that resemble rubella. Another 5% later develop cerebral calcification (decreasing IQ levels dramatically and causing sensorineural deafness and psychomotor retardation).

===Immunocompromised adults===
Primary  CMV infection in patients with weakened immune systems can lead to serious disease. However, a more common problem is reactivation of the latent virus.

Infection with CMV is a major cause of disease and death in immunocompromised patients, including organ transplant recipients, patients undergoing [[dialysis|hemodialysis]], patients with [[cancer]], patients receiving [[immunosuppressive]] drugs, and [[HIV]]-infected patients. Exposing immunosuppressed patients to outside sources of CMV should be minimized to avoid the risk of serious infection. Susceptible patients without CMV infection can be infected by receiving infected organs and blood products unless care is taken.

In patients with a depressed immune system, CMV-related disease may be much more aggressive. 

Specific disease entities recognised in those people are 
* CMV hepatitis, which may cause fulminant [[liver failure]]
* [[cytomegalovirus retinitis]] (inflammation of the [[retina]], characterised by a "pizza pie appearance" on [[ophthalmoscopy]])
* [[cytomegalovirus colitis]] (inflammation of the [[colon (anatomy)|large bowel]])
* CMV [[pneumonitis]]
* CMV [[esophagitis]]<ref name="ClassenTytgat2010">{{cite book|author1=Meinhard Classen|author2=Guido N. J. Tytgat|author3=M.D. Ph.D.|coauthors=Charles J. Lightdale|title=Gastroenterological Endoscopy|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Tb2Bnn_icI0C&pg=PA490|accessdate=26 June 2010|year=2010|publisher=Thieme|isbn=978-3-13-125852-6|pages=490–}}</ref>

* polyradiculopathy, transverse myelitis, and subacute encephalitis

Patients without CMV infection who are given organ transplants from CMV-infected donors require prophylactic treatment with [[valganciclovir]] (ideally) or [[ganciclovir]], and regular serological monitoring to detect a rising CMV titre; if treated early establishment of a potentially life-threatening infection can be prevented.

===Immunocompetent adults===
CMV infections can still be of clinical significance in adult immunocompetent populations:

* CMV [[mononucleosis]] (some sources reserve "mononucleosis" for [[Epstein-Barr Virus|EBV]] only)
* Post-transfusion CMV – similar to CMV mononucleosis
* A 2009 study suggests that CMV infection may be linked to the development of [[arterial hypertension]].<ref name=Cheng_et_al_2009 /> Mice fed a high [[cholesterol]] diet showed significantly more vascular damage and hypertension when they had been infected with CMV. CMV infection stimulated [[cytokine]]s – [[Interleukin 6|IL6]], [[Tumor necrosis factors|TNF]], and [[CCL2|MCP1]] – in the infected mice, indicating that the infection led to an inflammatory response in vessels and other tissues. Further, [[renin]] and [[angiotensin II]] release were increased in these animals as additional factors to lead to hypertension. In humans CMV infection has been demonstrated in the aortic smooth muscle cells from patients with abdominal [[aortic aneurysm]]s suggesting that CMV infection contributes to vascular disease.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=J Mol Med. | title=Active cytomegalovirus infection in aortic smooth muscle cells from patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm.| author=Gredmark-Russ S, Dzabic M, Rahbar A, Wanhainen A, Björck M, Larsson E, Michel JB, Söderberg-Nauclér C. |pmid=19083194| year=2009| volume=87| issue=4| pages=347–56| doi=10.1007/s00109-008-0413-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=Lab Invest. |title=In situ detection of frequent and active infection of human cytomegalovirus in inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms: possible pathogenic role in sustained chronic inflammatory reaction.| author=Yonemitsu Y, Nakagawa K, Tanaka S, Mori R, Sugimachi K, Sueishi K. |pmid=8606483 |year=1996 |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=723–36}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}
Most infections with CMV are not diagnosed because the virus usually produces few, if any, symptoms and tends to reactivate intermittently without symptoms. However, persons who have been infected with CMV develop [[antibodies]] to the virus, and these antibodies persist in the body for the lifetime of that individual. A number of laboratory tests that detect these antibodies to CMV have been developed to determine if infection has occurred and are widely available from commercial laboratories. In addition, the virus can be cultured from specimens obtained from urine, throat swabs, bronchial lavages and tissue samples to detect active infection. Both qualitative and quantitative [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) testing for CMV are available as well, allowing physicians to monitor the [[viral load]] of CMV-infected patients.

CMV pp65 antigenemia test is a immunofluorescence based assay which utilizes an indirect immunofluorescence technique for identifying the pp65 protein of cytomegalovirus in peripheral blood leukocytes. The CMV pp65 assay is widely used for monitoring CMV infections and its response to antiviral treatment in patients who are under immunosuppressive therapy and have had renal transplantation surgery as the antigenemia results are obtained about 5 days before the onset of symptomatic CMV disease. The advantage of this assay is the rapidity in providing results in a few hours and that the pp65 antigen determination represents a useful parameter for the physician to initiate antiviral therapy. The major disadvantage of the pp65 assay is that only limited number of samples can be processed per test batch.

CMV should be suspected if a patient has symptoms of [[infectious mononucleosis]] but has negative test results for mononucleosis and [[Epstein-Barr virus]], or if they show signs of hepatitis, but has negative test results for [[hepatitis A]], [[Hepatitis B|B]], and [[Hepatitis C|C]].

For best diagnostic results, laboratory tests for CMV antibody should be performed by using paired serum samples. One blood sample should be taken upon suspicion of CMV, and another one taken within 2 weeks. A virus culture can be performed at any time the patient is symptomatic. Laboratory testing for antibody to CMV can be performed to determine if a woman has already had CMV infection. However, routine testing of all pregnant women is costly and the need for testing should therefore be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

===Serologic testing===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}
The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (or [[ELISA]]) is the most commonly available serologic test for measuring antibody to CMV. The result can be used to determine if acute infection, prior infection, or passively acquired maternal antibody in an infant is present. Other tests include various fluorescence assays, indirect [[hemagglutination]], (PCR) and [[latex fixation test|latex agglutination]].

An ELISA technique for CMV-specific [[IgM]] is available, but may give [[false-positive]] results unless steps are taken to remove [[rheumatoid factor]] or most of the [[IgG]] [[antibody]] before the serum sample is tested. Because CMV-specific IgM may be produced in low levels in reactivated CMV infection, its presence is not always indicative of primary infection. Only virus recovered from a target organ, such as the lung, provides unequivocal evidence that the current illness is caused by acquired CMV infection. If serologic tests detect a positive or high titer of IgG, this result should not automatically be interpreted to mean that active CMV infection is present. However, if antibody tests of paired serum samples show a fourfold rise in IgG antibody and a significant level of IgM antibody, meaning equal to at least 30% of the IgG value, or virus is cultured from a urine or throat specimen, the findings indicate that an active CMV infection is present.

=== Relevance to blood donors ===
Although the risks discussed above are generally low, CMV assays are part of the standard screening for non-directed [[blood donation]] (donations not specified for a particular patient) in the U.S., the UK and many other countries.  CMV-negative donations are then earmarked for transfusion to infants or immunocompromised patients. Some blood donation centers maintain lists of donors whose blood is CMV negative due to special demands.<ref name=UBS>{{cite web | title = United Blood Services FAQs | url = http://www.unitedbloodservices.org/faqs.html | accessdate = 2007-05-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070519105254/http://www.unitedbloodservices.org/faqs.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-19}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Cytomegalovirus Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (CMV-IGIV) is an immunoglobulin G (IgG) containing a standardized amount of antibody to Cytomegalovirus (CMV). It may be used for the prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus disease associated with transplantation of kidney, lung, liver, pancreas, and heart.

Alone or in combination with an antiviral agent, it has been shown to:
*Reduce the risk of CMV-related disease and death in some of the highest-risk transplant patients
*Provide a measurable long-term survival benefit
*Produce minimal treatment-related side effects and adverse events.<ref>[http://www.cytogam.com/pdfs/Cytogam%20PI.pdf Cytogam Prescribing Info] CSL Behring AG</ref>

[[Ganciclovir]] (Cytovene) treatment is used for patients with depressed immunity who have either sight-related or life-threatening illnesses. [[Valganciclovir]] (Valcyte) is an antiviral drug that is also effective and is given orally. The therapeutic effectiveness is frequently compromised by the emergence of drug-resistant virus isolates. A variety of amino acid changes in the UL97 protein kinase and the viral DNA polymerase have been reported to cause drug resistance. [[Foscarnet]] or cidofovir are only given to patients with CMV resistant to ganciclovir, because foscarnet has notable nephrotoxicity, resulting in increased or decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> or P, and decreased Mg<sup>2+</sup>.

==Drug resistance==
[[File:hcmvdrugs.pdf|border|right|Antiviral mechanisms of HCMV drugs.]]
All three currently licensed anti-HCMV drugs target the viral [[DNA polymerase]], pUL54. [[Ganciclovir]] (GCV) acts as nucleoside analogue. Its antiviral activity requires phosphorylation by the HCMV protein kinase, pUL97.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Nature| title=A protein kinase homologue controls phosphorylation of ganciclovir in human cytomegalovirus-infected cells.| author=Sullivan V, Talarico CL, Stanat SCC, Davis M, Coen DM, Biron KK |pmid= 1319560| year=1992| volume=358| pages=162–164| doi=10.1038/358162a0| issue=6382}}</ref> The second drug, [[Cidofovir]] (CDV), is a nucleotide analogue, which is already phosphorylated and thus active. Finally, [[Foscarnet]] (FOS) has a different mode of action. It directly inhibits polymerase function by blocking the [[pyrophosphate]] binding site of pUL54.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Drugs| title=Foscarnet.

Two HCMV proteins are implicated in antiviral resistance against these three drugs: pUL97 and pUL54. Specific mutations in pUL97 can cause reduced phosphorylation activity of this viral protein kinase.

Some mutations in pUL54 can increase the polymerase’s [[exonuclease]] activity. This causes enhanced recognition of incorporated GCV and CDV. As a result, these dNTP analogues are excised more efficiently. 
Major risk factors for HCMV drug resistance are the residual capacity of the host’s immune system to control viral replication and the overall amount and duration of viral replication.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Lancet| title=Ganciclovir resistance: a matter of time and titre.| author= Drew WL|pmid=10968428| year=2000| volume=356| pages=609–610| doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02597-6}}</ref> 
HCMV antiviral drug resistance can be detected by phenotypic or by genotypic drug resistance testing. Phenotypic resistance testing involves cultivation of the virus in cell culture and testing its susceptibility using different antiviral drug concentrations in order to determine [[EC50]] values. In contrast, genotypic resistance testing means the detection of resistance associated mutations in UL97 and UL54 by [[sequencing]]. Genotypic resistance testing is becoming the method of choice because it is faster, but requires previous phenotypic characterisation of each newly found mutation. This can be performed via a [http://www.informatik.uni-ulm.de/ni/mitarbeiter/HKestler/hcmv web-based search tool] that links a patient’s HCMV sequence to a database containing all published UL97 and UL54 mutations and corresponding antiviral drug susceptibility phenotypes.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Antiviral Research| title=A new tool linking human cytomegalovirus drug resistance mutations to resistance phenotypes.| author=Chevillotte M, von Einem J, Meier BM, Lin FM, Kestler HA, Mertens T |pmid=19853628| year=2010| volume=85| pages=318–27| doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2009.10.004}}</ref>
