Further, "they condemn the continued use of electro-convulsive therapy—or ECT, also known as electroshock—which they say violates patients' human rights."<ref name=lat>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/oct/26/magazine/tm-survivors43 |title=Losing the Mind |author=David Davis |date=October 26, 2003 |work=LA Times }}</ref>

Oaks has stated that the psychiatric drugs that patients take are debilitating and have harmful side effects, and people can often recover without them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mindfreedom.org/campaign/media/mf/national-journal-200704 |title=Paved With Good Intentions? |author=Randy Barrett and Neil Munro  |date=Apr 28, 2007  |work=National Journal }}</ref> He has protested against drug companies and participated in hunger strikes to "demand proof that drugs can manage chemical imbalances in the brain".<ref name=ny12/> 
Oaks has called for "a nonviolent revolution throughout the mental health system".<ref>{{cite web |url= |title=David W. Oaks: "We call for a nonviolent revolution in the mental health system." |author=Jenny Westberg |date=January 23, 2010 |work=Portland Mental Health Examiner }}</ref>  

David Oaks himself was institutionalized and forcibly medicated in the 1970s, while studying at Harvard University, for what was diagnosed as [[schizophrenia]].  He has stated that he recovered by rejecting drugs and getting support from family and friends.<ref name=lat/> Oaks has stated that he "maintains his mental health with exercise, diet, peer counseling and wilderness trips — strategies that are well outside the mainstream thinking of psychiatrists and many patients".<ref name=ny12>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html?pagewanted=all |title=‘Mad Pride’ Fights a Stigma |author=Gabrielle Glaser |date=May 11, 2008 |work=New York Times }}</ref>
