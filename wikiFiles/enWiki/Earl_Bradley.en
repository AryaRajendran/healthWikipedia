In the wake of his arrest, it emerged that he had faced accusations of child abuse as early as 1995 in both [[Delaware]] and [[Pennsylvania]].

==Life and reputation==

Bradley was born and raised in [[Philadelphia]]. He graduated from the [[Temple University]] School of Medicine in 1983 and completed his pediatrics residency at [[Thomas Jefferson University]] Hospital in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vitals.com/doctor/profile/1669414553 |title=Dr. Earl Bradley, Pediatrician - Doctor in Lewes, DE - Pediatrics |publisher=Vitals.com |date=2010-02-22 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref> Around 1984, he began working at Frankford-Torresdale hospital on Knights Road in Northeast Philadelphia. He opened his own practice in a small complex just a few blocks away, at Academy and Red Lion Roads in Morrell Park.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://cbs3.com/local/Dr.Earl.Bradley.2.1390288.html |title=Dr. Earl Bradley, Charged With Raping, Sexually Abusing Young Patients Has Ties To Philadelphia |publisher=cbs3.com |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-05-18}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> He continued to work at Jefferson until a sudden move to Lewes on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] in 1995.<ref name="winnipegsun1">{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipegsun.com/news/world/2010/01/10/12408501-sun.html |title='System failed' with pedo doc &#124; World &#124; News |publisher=Winnipeg Sun |date=2010-01-10 |accessdate=2010-05-18}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The move was abrupt and poorly planned, with many patients complaining that they were not even notified that appointments had been cancelled.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

In Lewes, Bradley was widely regarded as eccentric.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=9520897 |title=Warnings About Accused Del.

==Accusations of child abuse==
The first known allegations of inappropriate conduct by Bradley came in 1994, when Thomas Jefferson University Hospital investigated a patient’s complaint of sexual misconduct.<ref name="capegazette1">{{cite web|last=Ritter |first=Laura |url=http://www.capegazette.com/storiescurrent/200912/bradley-pa22.html |title=Bradley accused of misconduct in Pennsylvania |publisher=CapeGazette.com |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref> There was a second allegation in 1995.<ref name="drphil1">{{cite web|url=http://www.drphil.com/slideshows/slideshow/5663/?id=5663&slide=2&showID=1423&preview=&versionID= |title=Dr. Phil.com |publisher=Dr. Phil.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref> The hospital could not verify the claim, and records remain sealed.<ref name="capegazette1"/> Bradley promptly closed his fledgling private practice and relocated with his children to Lewes, where he took a job with Beebe Medical Center.<ref name="winnipegsun1"/>

In 2004, Bradley’s sister Lynda Barnes, who had served as an office manager at his medical office, alerted the state medical society that parents had complained to her about inappropriate touching by Bradley.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmdt.com/news-archive.aspx?item=4800 |title=::. WMDT 47 News Delmarvas Choice .:: |publisher=Wmdt.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref> Barnes also reported that Bradley physically and emotionally abused his own son, and stole prescription [[antidepressants]] from the office.<ref name="capegazette2">{{cite web|last=Mavity |first=Ryan |url=http://www.capegazette.com/storiescurrent/201001/bradley-milford08.html |title=Milford police investigated Bradley in 2005 |publisher=CapeGazette.com |date=2010-01-07 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref>

Allegations were made again in 2005. Police records show that a nurse reported that he videotaped kids playing and other doctors reported complaints about long and unnecessary [[vagina]]l exams.<ref name="drphil1"/> When police in [[Milford, Delaware]], sought a [[warrant (law)|warrant]] to arrest him for inappropriately touching a child patient, the Attorney General’s office concluded at the time that there was insufficient evidence to warrant prosecution.<ref name="capegazette2"/>

On December 16, 2009, following a year-long investigation and complaints of inappropriate touching by a two-year-old patient, Bradley was arrested and charged with nine counts, including a felony charge for a fourth degree rape of a two-year-old patient.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capegazette.com/storiescurrent/200912/bradleydocs17.html |title=Earl B. Bradley Case History |publisher=CapeGazette.com |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref> Soon after, relying on more than 13 hours of videotaped rapes and molestations discovered by police in Bradley’s home and office, additional warrants were issued. These included felony warrants for several counts of child exploitation and first-degree rape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capegazette.com/storiescurrent/200912/bradley18-3.html |title=Bradley faces 24 new counts of patient abuse |publisher=CapeGazette.com |date=2009-12-23 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref>

==Arrest, indictment and fallout==
Bradley surrendered to authorities on December 18, 2009. His bail was set at $2.9 million cash, which was not posted. An initial preliminary hearing was delayed after prison officials placed Bradley on a [[suicide]] watch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WN/delaware-pediatrician-earl-bradley-accused-sexually-abusing-young/story?id=9418371 |title=Delaware Pediatrician Earl Bradley Accused of Sexually Abusing Young Patients - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref> His attorney, Eugene Maurer, denied that Bradley was suicidal but complained that prison officials had deprived him of his prescription glasses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/delawareonline/access/1940238771.html?FMT=ABS&date=Jan+15,+2010 |title=The News Journal: Archives |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=2010-01-15 |accessdate=2010-05-18 | first=Dan | last=Shortridge}}</ref>

In February 2010, a [[grand jury]] sitting for the [[Delaware Superior Court]] indicted Bradley on 471 charges, including counts of rape and exploitation. 103 victims were identified in the indictment, though the Attorney General indicated that they expected to identify even more victims.<ref name="nytimes1"/> The indictment included allegations that Bradley had forced children as young as three months old to engage in intercourse and oral sex.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/doctor-in-us-to-go-on-trial-for-471-charges-of-child-rape-1908556.html |title=Doctor in US to go on trial for 471 charges of child rape - Americas, World |publisher=The Independent |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2010-05-18 | location=London | first=Lewis | last=Smith}}</ref> It also revealed that Bradley had videotaped sexual assaults during which his victims "appeared to lose consciousness" from Bradley choking them by forcing oral sex on his child victims. The videos also show children in diapers screaming as they attempted to escape from Bradley before he raped them in an outbuilding on the property.<ref>http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2011/08/26/20110826delaware-pediatrician-sex-assaults-sentence.html</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20100224/NEWS01/2240356 |title=Delaware crime: Dr. Earl Bradley sex case ignites outrage &#124; delawareonline.com &#124; The News Journal |publisher=delawareonline.com |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref>

Though his private lawyers quit after Delaware took steps to freeze his assets, Bradley was afforded a public defender and arraigned on March 24, 2010. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. A follow-on hearing was scheduled for May 17.<ref>{{cite news|author=Carlin DeGuerin Miller |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20001198-504083.html |title=Alleged Predator Pediatrician, Earl Bradley, Pleads Not Guilty to 471 Counts of Sexual Abuse - Crimesider |publisher=CBS News |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref>

The Delaware Board of Medical Practice suspended Bradley's license permanently on February 19, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newarkpostonline.com/articles/2010/02/20/news/doc4b805ebeee4e3581333060.txt |title=Newark Post - Newark, DE |publisher=Newarkpostonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref>

Delaware governor [[Jack Markell]], concerned about failures in the medical, police and legal communities that allowed Bradley's crimes to continue for more than a decade, has called for an independent review. [[Widener University]] Law School Dean [[Linda Ammons]] was appointed to head up that review.

Delaware Attorney General [[Beau Biden]], son of [[Vice President of the United States]] [[Joseph Biden]], announced in a January 2010 speech that he would not seek election to his father’s former seat in the [[United States Senate]] because he felt it was more important to fully pursue Bradley’s prosecution.<ref>{{cite web|author=Randall Chase |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/jan/25/beau-biden-vps-son-wont-seek-us-senate-seat/ |title=Beau Biden, VP's son, won't seek US Senate seat |publisher=SignOnSanDiego.com |date=2010-01-25 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref>

Bradley's case was moved to [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] from [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]] because of concerns about getting an impartial jury in Sussex County, as many families of his alleged victims lived there.  However, Bradley then waived his right to a jury trial, opting instead for a bench trial.  The case was then moved back to Sussex County.  After hearing evidence on June 7, 2011 Judge William C. Carpenter, the presiding Judge in Bradley's bench trial, stated he would issue his verdict at a later date.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/06/07/delaware.pediatrician.trial/index.html?hpt=ju_c2 | work=CNN | title=Delaware pediatrician goes on trial for alleged sex abuse | date=2011-06-07}}</ref>

On June 23, 2011, Bradley was convicted on all 24 counts on a consolidated indictment (which originally contained 529 counts): 14 counts of rape, seven counts of assault, and three counts of sexual exploitation of a child .<ref>http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20110623/NEWS/110623037/Dr-Earl-Bradley-found-guilty-raping-abusing-child-patients?odyssey=mod|breaking|text|Home</ref>

On August 26, 2011, Carpenter sentenced Bradley to the maximum sentence of 14 consecutive terms of life in prison  plus a further 165 years in prison without parole.  Under Delaware law, anyone convicted of raping three separate persons automatically receives life without parole.  Carpenter said that Bradley "betrayed his patients' trust and disgraced the medical profession", and that "you will never be in a position to harm a child again".<ref>http://news.yahoo.com/del-pediatrician-gets-life-abusing-patients-145713017.html Del. pediatrician gets life for abusing patients (AP News)</ref> 

Bradley appealed to the [[Delaware Supreme Court]], claiming that the original search warrant was not specific enough about where the evidence would be located, and that the police exceeded the limits of the warrant without probable cause.  The Delaware Supreme Court unanimously affirmed Bradley's conviction on September 6, 2012.<ref name=SupremeCourt/>

The office complex housing his former practice was demolished on October 10, 2011.<ref>http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&id=8356568</ref>  Earlier, state police confiscated the contents of Bradley's storage locker in [[Rehoboth Beach]] and destroyed them; the items were to be auctioned off to satisfy unpaid rent, but Biden intervened on behalf of the victims to buy them for a symbolic $1 so as not to take the chance of them ever being used again.<ref>Sanginiti, Terri.
