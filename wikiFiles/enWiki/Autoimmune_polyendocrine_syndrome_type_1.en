'''Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1''' ('''APS-1'''), also known as '''autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy''' ('''APECED'''), '''Whitaker syndrome''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/124183-overview|title=Polyglandular Autoimmune Syndrome, Type I - eMedicine Endocrinology|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=2009-04-17}}</ref> or '''[[candidiasis]]-[[hypoparathyroidism]]-[[Addison's disease]]-syndrome''',<ref name="greenspan">{{Cite book | author=Greenspan, Francis S.; Gardner, David C. | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=Basic  clinical endocrinology | year=2004 | publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=New York  | isbn=0-07-140297-7 | pages=103}}</ref> is a subtype of [[autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome]], in which multiple [[endocrine gland]]s dysfunction as a result of [[autoimmunity]]. It is a [[genetic disorder]] attributed to a defect in the ''[[autoimmune regulator|AIRE]]'' gene that normally confers [[immune tolerance]]. It is inherited in a [[recessive]] fashion.

Its main features include:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}
* A mild [[immune deficiency]], leading to persistent mucosal and cutaneous infections with [[Candida (genus)|candida]] yeasts. There is also decreased function of the [[spleen]] (asplenism).
* Autoimmune dysfunction of the [[parathyroid gland]] (leading to [[hypocalcaemia]]) and the [[adrenal gland]] (Addison's disease: [[hypoglycemia]], [[hypotension]] and severe reactions in disease).
* Other disease associations are:
** [[hypothyroidism]]
** [[hypogonadism]] and infertility
** [[vitiligo]] (depigmentation of the skin)
** [[alopecia]] (baldness)
** [[malabsorption]]
** [[pernicious anemia]]
** [[Autoimmune hepatitis|chronic active (autoimmune) hepatitis]]
