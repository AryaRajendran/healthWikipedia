An '''artificial heart''' is a device that replaces the [[human heart|heart]]. Artificial hearts are typically used to bridge the time to [[heart transplantation]], or to permanently replace the heart in case heart transplantation is impossible. Although other similar inventions preceded it going back to the late 1940s, the first artificial heart to be successfully implanted in a human was the Jarvik-7, designed by [[Robert Jarvik]] and implemented in 1982. The first two patients to receive these hearts, Barney Clark and William Schroeder, survived 112 and 620 days beyond their surgeries, respectively.<ref>[http://www.discoveriesinmedicine.com/Apg-Ban/Artificial-Heart.html Artificial Heart - Early developments<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

An artificial heart is distinct from a [[ventricular assist device]] designed to support a failing heart. It is also distinct from a [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] machine, which is an external device used to provide the functions of both the heart and lungs and are only used for a few hours at a time, most commonly during [[cardiac surgery]].

==FDA approved artificial hearts==
'''SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart'''

[[File:Graphic of the SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart beside a human heart.jpg|thumb|Similar to a heart transplant, the SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart replaces both failing heart ventricles and the four heart valves.]]The SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart (formerly known as the CardioWest TAH), manufactured by [http://www.syncardia.com SynCardia Systems, Inc.] was the first [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]-approved total artificial heart. It received FDA approval on October 15, 2004, following a 10-year clinical study.<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf3/P030011b.pdf Syncardia Temporary CardioWest Total Artificial Heart]</ref>
Originally designed as a permanent replacement heart, it is currently approved as a bridge to donor heart transplant for patients dying because both sides of their hearts are failing (irreversible, end-stage biventricular failure). SynCardia claims there are more than 1000 implants of the Total Artificial Heart, accounting for more than 270 patient years of life on this device.<ref>[http://www.syncardia.com/2012-Press-Releases/1000th-implant-of-the-worlds-only-approved-total-artificial-heart-performed.html  1,000th Implant of the World's Only Approved Total Artificial Heart Performed]</ref>
During the 10-year pivotal clinical study, 79% of patients receiving the Total Artificial Heart survived to transplant (''New England Journal of Medicine'' 2004; 351: 859–867).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/351/9/859 |title=NEJM - Cardiac Replacement with a Total Artificial Heart as a Bridge to Transplantation |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa040186 |publisher=Content.nejm.org |date=2004-12-09 |accessdate=2010-05-05| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100412202954/http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/351/9/859| archivedate= 12 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> This is the highest bridge-to-transplant rate for any heart device in the world.<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf3/P030011b.pdf FDA Summary of Safety and Effectiveness]</ref>  

In 2010, SynCardia's [http://www.syncardia.com/Medical-Professionals/discharge-drivers-us.html Freedom portable driver], the world's first wearable power supply for the Total Artificial Heart, received the CE Mark for use in Europe and FDA approval to undergo an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) clinical study in the U.S. Weighing 13.5 pounds (6.1 kilograms), the Freedom driver  allows stable Total Artificial Heart patients who meet discharge criteria to leave the hospital and resume their lives at home and in their communities while they wait for a matching donor heart.<ref>[http://www.aana.com/newsandjournal/Documents/totalheart-0412-p105-112.pdf Total Artificial Heart Freedom Driver in a Patient With End-Stage Biventricular Heart Failure]</ref> On April 24, 2012, SynCardia completed the minimum enrollment required by the clinical study. The company plans to submit the Freedom portable driver for FDA approval through a post-market approval supplement in Q4 2012.

According to SynCardia, the longest a patient has been supported with the Total Artificial Heart is 1,374 days (nearly four years) before he received a successful heart transplant.

'''AbioCor Replacement Heart'''

Unlike the CardioWest TAH, the [[AbioCor]] Replacement Heart by [[AbioMed]] is fully implantable, meaning that no wires or tubes penetrate the skin, and, therefore, there is less risk of infection.<ref>[http://www.abiomed.com/products/heart-replacement/ AbioCor]</ref>

The AbioCor is approved for use in severe biventricular end-stage heart disease patients who are not eligible for heart transplant and have no other viable treatment options.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/pdf4/H040006a.pdf |publisher=Department of Health & Human Services |title=Letter |archiveurl=http://waybackmachine.org/*/http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/pdf4/H040006a.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-26}}</ref> As of April 2011, 14 patients have been implanted with the AbioCor, with one patient living for 512 days with the AbioCor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abiomed.com/assets/2010/11/AbioCor-FAQ-FINAL.pdf |title=AbioCor Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Abiomed |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}</ref>

==Origins==
A synthetic replacement for the heart remains one of the long-sought holy grails of modern medicine. The obvious benefit of a functional artificial heart would be to lower the need for [[Heart transplantation|heart transplant]]s, because the demand for organs always greatly exceeds supply.

Although the heart is conceptually a pump, it embodies subtleties that defy straightforward emulation with synthetic materials and power supplies. Consequences of these issues include severe [[transplant rejection|foreign-body rejection]] and external batteries that limit patient mobility. These complications limited the lifespan of early human recipients to hours or days.

== Early development ==
A [[heart-lung machine]] was used in 1953 during a successful open heart surgery. Dr. [[John Heysham Gibbon]], the inventor of the machine, performed the operation and developed the heart-lung substitute himself.

Although Jarvik created the idea and rough draft for the artificial heart, his models were not created of a material that the human body would accept. Dayton, Ohio's Ival O. Salyer, along with various colleagues, developed a polymer material that the human body would not necessarily reject. 

On July 3, 1952, 41-year-old [[Henry Opitek]], suffering from shortness of breath, made medical history at [http://www.harperhospital.org/harper/ Harper University Hospital] at [[Wayne State University]] in Michigan. The [[Dodrill-GMR]] heart machine, considered to be the first operational mechanical heart, was successfully used while performing heart surgery.<ref>American Heart Association. The Mechanical Heart celebrates 50 lifesaving years. 22 10 2002. 9 Feb 2008 <http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml;jsessionid=EFNP3NSFUBXLICQFCXQCDSQ?identifier=3005888></ref><ref>[http://www.med.wayne.edu/news_media/2002/press14.asp Wayne State University | School of Medicine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Dr. [[Forest Dewey Dodrill]] used the machine in 1952 to bypass Henry Opitek's left ventricle for 50 minutes while he opened the patient's left atrium and worked to repair the mitral valve. In Dr. Dodrill's post-operative report, he notes, "To our knowledge, this is the first instance of survival of a patient when a mechanical heart mechanism was used to take over the complete body function of maintaining the blood supply of the body while the heart was open and operated on."<ref>Stephenson, Larry W, et al. "The Michigan Heart: The World's First Successful Open Heart Operation?" ''Journal of Cardiac Surgery'' 17.3 (2002): 238–246.</ref>

The scientific interest for the development of a solution for heart disease developed in different research groups worldwide.

===Early designs of total artificial hearts===
In 1949, a precursor to the modern artificial heart pump was built by doctors [[William Sewell (physician)|William Sewell]] and [[William Glenn]] of the [[Yale School of Medicine]] using an [[Erector Set]], assorted odds and ends, and dime-store toys. The external pump successfully bypassed the heart of a dog for more than an hour.<ref>Lavietes, Stuart. [http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/17/us/william-glenn-88-surgeon-who-invented-heart-procedure.html "William Glenn, 88, Surgeon Who Invented Heart Procedure"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 17, 2003. Accessed May 21, 2009.</ref>

American ventriloquist and inventor [[Paul Winchell]] invented an artificial heart with the assistance of [[Henry Heimlich|Dr. Henry Heimlich]] (the inventor of the [[Heimlich_maneuver#Abdominal_thrusts|Heimlich Maneuver]]) and held the first patent for such a device. The University of Utah developed a similar apparatus around the same time, but when they tried to patent it, Winchell's heart was cited as prior art. The university requested that Winchell donate the heart to the University of Utah, which he did.
There is some debate as to how much of Winchell's design Dr. Robert Jarvik used in creating Jarvik's artificial heart. Dr. Heimlich states, "I saw the heart, I saw the patent and I saw the letters. The basic principle used in Winchell's heart and Jarvik's heart is exactly the same."[9] Jarvik denies that any of Winchell's design elements were incorporated into the device he fabricated for humans which was successfully implanted into Barney Clark in 1982.[1][10]

On December 12, 1957, Dr. [[Willem Johan Kolff]], the world's most prolific inventor of artificial organs, implanted an artificial heart into a dog at Cleveland Clinic. The dog lived for 90 minutes. 

In 1958, [[Domingo Liotta]] initiated the studies of TAH replacement at Lyon, France, and in 1959–60 at the [[National University of Córdoba]], Argentina. He presented his work at the meeting of the American Society for Artificial Internal Organs held in Atlantic City in March 1961. At that meeting, Dr. Liotta described the implantation of three types of orthotopic (inside the pericardial sac) TAHs in dogs, each of which used a different source of external energy: an implantable electric motor, an implantable rotating pump with an external electric motor, and a pneumatic pump.<ref>Artificial Heart in the chest: Preliminary report. Trans.Amer. Soc. Inter. Organs, 1961, 7:318</ref><ref>Ablation experimentale et replacement du coeur par un coer artificial intra-thoracique. Lyon Cirurgical, 1961, 57:704</ref>

In 1964, the [[National Institutes of Health]] started the Artificial Heart Program, with the goal of putting a man-made organ into a human by the end of the decade.<ref name="autogenerated1">Sandeep Jauhar, M.D., Ph.D. "The Artificial Heart." ''New England Journal of Medicine'' (2004): 542–544.</ref>

In February 1966, [[Dr. Adrian Kantrowitz]] rose to international prominence when he performed the world's first permanent implantation of a partial mechanical heart (left ventricular assist device) at [[Maimonides Medical Center]].<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2676518/, NCBI In Memoriam Dr. Adrian Kantrowitz</ref> 

{{anchor|Jarvik}}In 1967, Dr. Kolff left Cleveland Clinic to start the Division of Artificial Organs at the [[University of Utah]] and pursue his work on the artificial heart.
*In 1973, a calf named Tony survived for 30 days on an early Kolff heart.
*In 1975, a bull named Burk survived 90 days on the artificial heart.
*In 1976, a calf named Abebe lived for 184 days on the Jarvik 5 artificial heart.
*In 1981, a calf named Alfred Lord Tennyson lived for 268 days on the Jarvik 5.

Over the years, more than 200 physicians, engineers, students and faculty developed, tested and improved Dr. Kolff's artificial heart. To help manage his many endeavors, Dr. Kolff assigned project managers. Each project was named after its manager. Graduate student Robert Jarvik was the project manager for the artificial heart, which was subsequently renamed the Jarvik 7.

In 1981, Dr. [[William DeVries]] submitted a request to the FDA to implant the Jarvik 7 into a human being. On December 2, 1982, Dr. Kolff implanted the Jarvik 7 artificial heart into Barney Clark, a dentist from Seattle who was suffering from severe congestive heart failure. While Clark lived for 112 days tethered to an external pneumatic compressor, a device weighing some {{convert|400|lb|kg}}, during that time he suffered prolonged periods of confusion and a number of instances of bleeding, and asked several times to be allowed to die.<ref>{{cite web

On April 4, 1969, [[Domingo Liotta]] and [[Denton Cooley|Denton A. Cooley]] replaced a dying man's heart with a mechanical heart inside the chest at [[The Texas Heart Institute]] in [[Houston]] as a bridge for a transplant. The patient woke up and recovered well. After 64 hours, the pneumatic-powered artificial heart was removed and replaced by a donor heart. However thirty-two hours after transplantation, the patient died of what was later proved to be an acute pulmonary infection, extended to both lungs, caused by fungi, most likely caused by an [[immunosuppressive drug]] complication.<ref>Orthotopic cardiac prosthesis for two-staged cardiac replacement. ''Am J Cardio'' 1969; 24:723–730.</ref>

The original prototype of Liotta-Cooley artificial heart used in this historic operation is prominently displayed in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]] [http://americanhistory.si.edu/exhibitions/small_exhibition.cfm?key=1267&exkey=143&pagekey=216 "Treasures of American History"] exhibit in Washington, D.C.

===First clinical applications of a permanent pneumatic total artificial heart===
The eighty-fifth clinical use of an artificial heart designed for permanent implantation rather than a bridge to transplant occurred in 1982 at the [[University of Utah]]. Artificial kidney pioneer Dr. [[Willem Johan Kolff]] started the Utah artificial organs program in 1967.<ref>Spare Parts: Organ Replacement in American Society. Renee C. Fox and Judith P. Swazey. New York: Oxford University Press; 1992, pp. 102–104</ref> There, physician-engineer Dr. Clifford Kwan-Gett invented two components of an integrated pneumatic artificial heart system: a ventricle with hemispherical diaphragms that did not crush red blood cells (a problem with previous artificial hearts) and an external heart driver that inherently regulated blood flow without needing complex control systems.<ref>Kwan-Gett CS, Van Kampen KR, Kawai J, Eastwood N, Kolff WJ. "Results of total artificial heart implantation in calves." ''Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery''. 1971 Dec; 62(6):880–889.</ref> Independently, ventriloquist [[Paul Winchell]] designed and patented a similarly shaped ventricle and donated the patent to the Utah program.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944609,00.html | work=Time | title=Winchell's Heart | date=March 12, 1973 | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}</ref> Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, veterinarian Dr. Donald Olsen led a series of calf experiments that refined the artificial heart and its surgical care. During that time, as a student at the University of Utah, Dr. [[Robert Jarvik]] combined several modifications: an ovoid shape to fit inside the human chest, a more blood-compatible polyurethane developed by biomedical engineer Dr. Donald Lyman, and a fabrication method by Kwan-Gett that made the inside of the ventricles smooth and seamless to reduce dangerous stroke-causing blood clots.<ref>[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/transplant/html/kolff.html Kolff<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On December 2, 1982, Dr. [[William DeVries]] implanted the artificial heart into retired dentist Dr. Barney Bailey Clark (born January 21, 1921), who survived 112 days with the device, dying on March 23, 1983. [[William J. Schroeder|Bill Schroeder]] became the second recipient and lived for a record 620 days.

Contrary to popular belief and erroneous articles in several periodicals, the Jarvik heart was not banned for permanent use. Today, the modern version of the Jarvik 7 is known as the SynCardia temporary CardioWest Total Artificial Heart. It has been implanted in more than 800 people as a bridge to transplantation.

In the mid-1980s, artificial hearts were powered by dishwasher-sized pneumatic power sources whose lineage went back to [[Alpha-Laval]] [[Dairy#Milking machines|milking machines]]. Moreover, two sizable catheters had to cross the body wall to carry the pneumatic pulses to the implanted heart, greatly increasing the risk of infection. To speed development of a new generation of technologies, the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]] opened a competition for implantable electrically powered artificial hearts. Three groups received funding: [[Cleveland Clinic]] in Cleveland, Ohio; the College of Medicine of [[Pennsylvania State University]] ([[Penn State Hershey Medical Center]]) in Hershey, Pennsylvania; and AbioMed, Inc. of Danvers, Massachusetts. Despite considerable progress, the Cleveland program was discontinued after the first five years.

Polymeric trileaflet valves ensure unidirectional blood flow with a low pressure gradient and good longevity. State-of-the-art transcutaneous energy transfer eliminates the need for electric wires crossing the chest wall.

===First clinical application of an intrathoracic pump===
On July 19, 1963, E. Stanley Crawford and Domingo Liotta implanted the first clinical Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) at [[The Methodist Hospital]] in Houston, Texas, in a patient who had a cardiac arrest after surgery. The patient survived for four days under mechanical support but did not recover from the complications of the cardiac arrest; finally, the pump was discontinued, and the patient died.

On April 21, 1966, [[Michael E. DeBakey|Michael DeBakey]] and Liotta implanted the first clinical LVAD in a paracorporeal position (where the external pump rests at the side of the patient) at The Methodist Hospital in Houston, in a patient experiencing cardiogenic shock after heart surgery. The patient developed neurological and pulmonary complications and died after few days of LVAD mechanical support. In October 1966, DeBakey and Liotta implanted the paracorporeal Liotta-DeBakey LVAD in a new patient who recovered well and was discharged from the hospital after 10 days of mechanical support, thus constituting the first successful use of an LVAD for postcardiotomy shock.

== Recent developments ==
In August 2006, an artificial heart was implanted into a 15-year-old girl at the [[Stollery Children's Hospital]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]]. It was intended to act as a temporary fixture until a donor heart could be found. Instead, the artificial heart (called a Berlin Heart) allowed for natural processes to occur and her heart healed on its own. After 146 days, the Berlin Heart was removed, and the girl's heart was able to function properly on its own.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20071016205936/http://capitalhealth.ca/NewsAndEvents/NewsReleases/2007/Berlin_Heart.htm Capital Health: One year later: Berlin Heart bridges patient back to health] (August 28, 2007), Capital Health, Edmonton (archived from [http://www.capitalhealth.ca/NewsAndEvents/NewsReleases/2007/Berlin_Heart.htm] the original) on 2007-10-01).</ref>

On December 16, 2011 the Berlin Heart, a ventricular assist  intended for children age 16 and under, gained U.S. FDA approval. The device has since been successfully implanted in several children including a 4-year-old Honduran girl at [[Children's Hospital Boston]].<ref>[http://vectorblog.org/2011/12/newly-approved-berlin-heart-prolongs-the-divide-between-life-and-death/Newly approved Berlin Heart helps patients waiting for a transplant] (December 30, 2011), Children's Hospital Boston.</ref>

In 2012, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine compared the Berlin Heart to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and concluded that "a ventricular assist device available in several sizes for use in children as a bridge to heart transplantation [such as the Berlin Heart] was associated with a significantly higher rate of survival as compared with ECMO."<ref>http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1014164</ref> The study's primary author, Dr. Charles D. Fraser, Jr., surgeon in chief at Texas Children's Hospital, explained: “With the Berlin Heart, we have a more effective therapy to offer patients earlier in the management of their heart failure. When we sit with parents, we have real data to offer so they can make an informed decision. This is a giant step forward.” <ref>http://www.texaschildrens.org/About-Us/News/Berlin-Heart-NEJM-2012/</ref>

=== Total artificial heart ===
In June 1996, a 46-year-old Chinese American Mr. Yao ST received the Asia's first total artificial heart implantation done by Dr. [[Jeng Wei]] at [http://home.chgh.org.tw/chgh/english/index.jspx Cheng-Hsin General Hospital] in [[Taiwan]]. This pneumatic [[Phoenix-7 Total Artificial Heart]] was manufactured by a dentist [[Kelvin K Cheng]], a physican [[T.M. Kao]] and colleagues at the [[Taiwan TAH Research Center]] in [[Tainan]]. With this experimental artificial heart, the patient's BP was maintained at 90-100/40-55 mmHg and cardiac output at 4.2-5.8 L/min. After 15 days of bridging, Mr. Yao received combined heart and kidney transplantation. {{As of|March 2013}}, he is still very well and is currently living in San Francisco, USA. Mr. Yao ST is the world first successful combined heart and kidney transplantation patient after bridging with total artificial heart. <ref>J Wei, KK Cheng, DY Tung, CY Chang, WM Wan, YC Chuang: Successful Use of Phoenix-7 Total Artificial Heart. Transplantation Proceedings, 1998, 30:3403-4</ref>

On October 27, 2008, French professor and leading [[Heart transplantation|heart transplant]] specialist [[Alain F. Carpentier]] announced that a fully implantable artificial heart will be ready for clinical trial by 2011 and for alternative transplant in 2013. It was developed and will be manufactured by him, biomedical firm [[:fr:Carmat|CARMAT SA]], and venture capital firm Truffle Capital.

In addition to cardio-surgery, there is the medico-psychological aspect of an artificial heart. A quarter of patients in the postoperative period after prosthetic valvular surgery, developed a specific psychopathological symptoms, which later received the name [[Skumin syndrome]] in 1978. It is possible that a similar problem will be discovered when conducting large-scale operations to implant an artificial heart.<ref name="Carpentier">{{cite web | author = | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = | date = http://heartforyoursoul.com/| title = About artificial heart | work = | publisher = Heart For Your Soul | accessdate = 2011-02-19 | description = a story about the prospects of creating an artificial heart on the basis of input provided by WordPress.

In August 2010, 50-year-old Angelo Tigano of [[Fairfield, New South Wales]], Australia, had his failing heart removed in a five-hour operation and it was replaced with the SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart by surgeon Dr Phillip Spratt, head of the heart transplant unit at [[St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney]].<ref>[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sydney-man-gets-first-heart-transplant-at-st-vincents-hospital/story-e6freuy9-1225905838117 dailyTelegraph.com.au, Sydney man receives Total Artificial Heart]</ref>

On 12 March 2011, an experimental artificial heart was implanted in 55-year-old Craig Lewis at The Texas Heart Institute in Houston by Drs. [[O. H. Frazier]] and [[William Cohn]]. The device is a combination of two modified [[HeartMate|HeartMate II]] pumps that is currently undergoing bovine trials.<ref>{{cite web |last=Berger |first=Eric |title=New artificial heart 'a leap forward' |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/7486853.html |publisher=''Houston Chronicle'' |accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref>

On 9 June 2011, 40 year old Matthew Green was implanted with the SynCardia temporary Total Artificial heart in a seven hour operation at Papworth Hospital. He was the first Briton to leave hospital supported by an artificial Heart on 2 August 2011.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14363731 | work=BBC News | title=Plastic heart gives dad Matthew Green new lease of life | date=August 2, 2011}}</ref>

can be used as an artificial heart, resulting in the patient being alive without a [[pulse]].

==Heart assist devices==
{{Main|ventricular assist device}}
Patients who have some remaining heart function but who can no longer live normally may be candidates for ventricular assist devices (VAD), which do not replace the human heart but complement it by taking up much of the function. 

The first Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) system was created by Domingo Liotta at [[Baylor College of Medicine]] in [[Houston]] in 1962.<ref>Prolonged Assisted circulation after cardiac or aortic surgery. Prolonged partial left ventricular bypass by means of intracorporeal circulation. This paper was finalist in The Young Investigators Award Contest of the American College of Cardiology. Denver, May 1962 Am. J. Cardiol. 1963, 12:399–404</ref>

Another VAD, the Kantrowitz CardioVad, designed by [[Adrian Kantrowitz]] boosts the native heart by taking up over 50% of its function.<ref name="Mitka">Mitka, Mike. "Midwest Trials of Heart-Assist Device." Journal of the American Medical Association 286.21 (2001): 2661.</ref> Additionally, the VAD can help patients on the wait list for a heart transplant. In a young person, this device could delay the need for a transplant by 10–15 years, or even allow the heart to recover, in which case the VAD can be removed.<ref name="Mitka"/>
The artificial heart is powered by a battery that needs to be changed several times while still working.

The first heart assist device was approved by the FDA in 1994, and two more received approval in 1998.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/NEW00656.html FDA APPROVES TWO PORTABLE HEART-ASSIST DEVICES] at FDA.gov</ref>
While the original assist devices emulated the pulsating heart, newer versions, such as the Heartmate II,<ref>[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17523&ch=biotech An Artificial Heart That Doesn't Beat] at TechnologyReview.com</ref> developed by The Texas Heart Institute of Houston, provide continuous flow. These pumps (which may be [[centrifugal pump|centrifugal]] or [[axial flow]]) are smaller and potentially more durable and last longer than the current generation of total heart replacement pumps. Another major advantage of a VAD is that the patient keeps the natural heart, which may still function for temporary back-up support if the mechanical pump were to stop. This may provide enough support to keep the patient alive until a solution to the problem is implemented.

Several continuous-flow ventricular assist devices have been approved for use in the European Union, and, as of August 2007, were undergoing clinical trials for FDA approval.

Suffering from end-stage heart failure, former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] underwent a procedure in July 2010 to have a VAD implanted. In 2012, he received a heart transplant at age 71 after 20 months on a waiting list.
