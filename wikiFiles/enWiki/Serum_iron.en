'''[[Blood plasma|Serum]] iron''' is a [[medicine|medical]] laboratory test that measures the amount of circulating [[iron]] that is bound to [[transferrin]]. Clinicians order this laboratory test when they are concerned about [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]], which can cause [[anemia]] and other problems.

65% of the iron in the body is bound up in [[hemoglobin]] molecules in [[red blood cell]]s. About 4% is bound up in [[myoglobin]] molecules. Around 30% of the iron in the body is stored as [[ferritin]] or [[hemosiderin]] in the [[spleen]], the [[bone marrow]] and the [[liver]]. Small amounts of iron can be found in other molecules in cells throughout the body. None of this iron is directly accessible by testing the serum.

However, some iron is circulating in the serum. Transferrin is a molecule produced by the liver that binds one or two iron(III) [[ions]], i.e. ferric iron, Fe3+; transferrin is essential if stored iron is to be moved and used. 

Most of the time, about 30% of the available sites on the transferrin molecule are filled. The test for serum iron uses blood drawn from [[vein]]s to measure the iron molecules that are bound to transferrin, and circulating in the blood.

The extent to which sites on transferrin molecules are filled by iron ions can be another helpful clinical indicator, known as [[percent transferrin saturation]]. Another lab test saturates the sample to measure the total amount of transferrin; this test is called [[total iron-binding capacity]] (TIBC). These three tests are generally done at the same time, and taken together are an important part of the diagnostic process for conditions such as [[anemia]], [[iron deficiency anemia]], [[anemia of chronic disease]] and [[Haemochromatosis]].

==Normal values==
Normal [[reference ranges for blood tests|reference ranges]] are:
* Serum Iron (SI): <ref name=uimc> [http://uimc.discoveryhospital.com/main.php?t=enc&id=1456 Serum Iron]. University of Illinois Medical Center. Accessed July 6, 2006. </ref>
** Men: 65 to 176  μg/dL
** Women: 50 to 170 μg/dL
** Newborns: 100 to 250 μg/dL
** Children: 50 to 120 μg/dL
* [[Total iron-binding capacity | TIBC]]: 240–450 μg/dL <ref name=uimc/>
* [[Transferrin saturation]]: 20–50% <ref name=uimc/>

μg/dL = [[microgram]]s per [[deciliter]].

Laboratories often use different units and "normal" may vary by population and the lab techniques used; look at the individual laboratory [[reference values]] to interpret a specific test (for instance, your own).
