'''Travel medicine''' or '''emporiatrics''' is the branch of [[medicine]] that deals with the prevention and management of health problems of [[international]] [[travel]]ers.

==Globalization and travel==
Globalization facilitates the spread of disease and increases the number of travelers who will be exposed to a different health environment. Major content areas of travel medicine include the global [[epidemiology]] of health risks to the traveler, [[vaccine|vaccinology]], [[malaria]] prevention, and pre-travel counseling designed to maintain the health of the approximately 600 million international travelers. It has been estimated that about 80 million travelers go annually from developed to developing countries.<ref name="Supercourse on Travel Medicine">[http://www.pitt.edu/~super1/lecture/lec19341/index.htm Supercourse on Travel Medicine]</ref>

==Mortality and morbidity==
[[Mortality rate|Mortality]] studies indicate that the [[cardiovascular disease]] accounts for most deaths during travel (50-70%), while [[injury]] and [[accident]] follow (~25%). [[Infectious disease]] accounts for about 2.8-4% of deaths during/from travel. [[Morbidity]] studies suggest that about half of the people from a developed country that stay one month in a developing country will get sick.<ref name="Supercourse on Travel Medicine"/> [[Traveler's diarrhea]] is the most common problem encountered.

==Disciplines==
The field of travel medicine encompasses a wide variety of disciplines including [[epidemiology]], [[infectious disease]], [[public health]], [[tropical medicine]], high altitude [[physiology]], travel related [[obstetrics]], [[psychiatry]], [[occupational medicine]], military and migration medicine, and [[environmental health]].

Special itineraries and activities include [[cruise ship]] travel, [[diving]], mass gatherings (e.g. the [[Hajj]]), and [[wilderness]]/remote regions travel.

Basically, travel medicine can divide into 4 main topics: [[Preventive medicine|prevention]] (vaccination and travel advice), assistance (dealing with [[repatriation]] and medical treatment of travelers), [[wilderness medicine]] (e.g. high-altitude medicine, cruise ship medicine, expedition medicine, etc.) and access to health care, provided by [[travel insurance]].

==Focus==
Travel medicine includes pre-travel consultation and evaluation, contingency planning during travel, and post-travel follow-up and care. Information is provided by the WHO that addresses health issues for travelers for each country as well as the specific health risks of air travel itself.<ref>[http://www.who.int/ith/en/ WHO Travel Information]</ref> Also, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] publishes valuable and up-to-date information. Key areas to consider are vaccination and the six Iâ€™s:
# Insects: [[Insect repellent|repellent]]s, [[mosquito net]]s, [[Antimalarial drug|antimalarial medication]]
# Ingestions: safety of [[drinking water]], food
# Indiscretion: [[HIV]], [[sexually transmitted disease]]
# Injuries: [[accident]] avoidance, [[Human security|personal safety]]
# Immersion: [[schistosomiasis]]
# [[Travel insurance|Insurance]]: coverage and services during travel, access to [[health care]]

==Specific disease problems==
[[Yellow fever]] is endemic to certain areas in Africa and South America. The CDC site delineates the risk areas and provides information about vaccination and preventive steps.<ref>[http://www2.ncid.cdc.gov/travel/yb/utils/ybGet.asp?section=dis&obj=yellowfever.htm CDC re: Yellow Fever]</ref>

[[Meningococcal meningitis]] is endemic in the tropical meningococcal belt of Africa. Vaccination is required for pilgrims going to [[Mecca]]. Detailed information is available on the CDC site.<ref>[http://www2.ncid.cdc.gov/travel/yb/utils/ybGet.asp?section=dis&obj=menin.htm&cssNav=browsecyb CDC re: Meningococcal Meningitis]</ref>

[[Malaria]] prevention consists of preventing or reducing exposure to mosquitos by using screened rooms, air-conditioning, and nets, and use of repellents (usually [[DEET]]). In addition, chemoprophylaxis is started before the travel, during the time of potential exposure, and for 4 weeks (chloroquine, [[doxycycline]], or mefloquine) or 7 days (atovaquone/proguanil or primaquine) after leaving the risk area. See detailed CDC site.<ref>[http://www2.ncid.cdc.gov/travel/yb/utils/ybGet.asp?section=dis&obj=index.htm&cssNav=browsecyb CDC re:Malaria]</ref>

==Medication kit==
The traveler should have a medication kit to provide for necessary and useful medication. Based on circumstances, it should include also malaria prophylaxis, [[condom]]s, and medication to combat [[traveler's diarrhea]]. In addition, a basic [[first aid kit]] can be of use.

Studies have shown there are four main medical problems that travellers develop - diarrhoea or gut problems, respiratory problems, wounds and pain. The medical kit should at least address these common things.

Research has also shown that the best treatment for travellers diarrhoea is to take an antibiotic (e.g. [[ciprofloxacin]]) plus a stopper (e.g. [[loperamide]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=International travel and health|year=2010|publisher=World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/ith/ITH2010chapter1.pdf|location=Geneva|chapter=Health risks and precautions: general considerations - Contents of a basic medical kit}}</ref>  Due to bacterial resistance, different parts of the world require different antibiotics.  It is best to consult a travel doctor to sort out the best medical kit for the exact destination and medical history of the person travelling.
