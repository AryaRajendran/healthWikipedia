'''Trimethylaminuria''' (TMAU), also known as '''fish odor syndrome''' or '''fish malodor syndrome''',<ref>{{cite journal | author=Mitchell SC, Smith RL | title=Trimethylaminuria: the fish malodor syndrome | journal=Drug Metab Dispos | year=2001 | pages=517–21 | volume=29 | issue=4 Pt 2 | pmid=11259343}}</ref> is a rare [[inborn error of metabolism|metabolic disorder]] that causes a defect in the normal production of the [[enzyme]] [[flavin containing monooxygenase 3]] (''FMO3'').<ref>{{cite journal | author=Treacy EP, et al.| title=Mutations of the flavin-containing monooxygenase gene (''FMO3'') cause trimethylaminuria, a defect in detoxication | journal=Human Molecular Genetics | year=1998 | pages=839–45 | volume=7 | issue=5| doi=10.1093/hmg/7.5.839| pmid=9536088}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Zschocke J, Kohlmueller D, Quak E, Meissner T, Hoffmann GF, Mayatepek E | title=Mild trimethylaminuria caused by common variants in FMO3 gene | journal=Lancet | year=1999 | pages=834–5 | volume=354 | issue=9181 | pmid=10485731 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)80019-1}}</ref> When ''FMO3'' is not working correctly or if not enough enzyme is produced, the body loses the ability to properly convert [[trimethylamine]] (TMA) from precursor compounds in food digestion into [[trimethylamine oxide]] (TMAO) through a process called ''N''-oxygenation. Trimethylamine then builds up and is released in the person's sweat, urine, and breath, giving off a strong [[Trimethylamine N-oxide|fishy odor]] or strong [[body odor]].

== History ==
The first clinical case of TMAU was described in 1970.<ref name="lancet4195988">{{cite journal | author=Humbert JA, Hammond KB, Hathaway WE. | title=Trimethylaminuria: the fish-odour syndrome | journal=Lancet | year=1970 | pages=770–1 | volume=2 | issue=7676 | pmid=4195988 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(70)90241-2}}</ref>

== Symptoms ==

Trimethylamine builds up in the body of patients with trimethylaminuria. The trimethylamine gets released in the person's sweat, urine, reproductive fluids, and breath, giving off a strong fishy or body odor. Some people with trimethylaminuria have a strong odor all the time, but most have a moderate smell that varies in intensity over time. Individuals with this condition do not have any physical symptoms, and typically appear healthy.<ref name="ggg">[http://www.genome.gov/11508983 genome.gov | Learning About Trimethylaminuria<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The condition seems to be more common in women than men, for unknown reasons. Scientists suspect that female sex hormones, such as [[progesterone]] and estrogen, aggravate symptoms. There are several reports that the condition worsens around puberty. In women, symptoms can worsen just before and during menstrual periods, after taking oral contraceptives, and around menopause.<ref name="ggg" />

This odor varies depending on many known factors, including diet, hormonal changes, stress level, amount of sweat, other odors in the space, and individual sense of smell.

== Diagnosis ==

Measurement of urine for the ratio of trimethylamine to trimethylamine oxide is the standard screening test. A blood test is available to provide genetic analysis. The prominent enzyme responsible for TMA N-oxygenation is coded by the FMO3 gene.

A similar test can be used to identify carriers of this condition - those individuals who carry one copy of a mutated gene but do not have symptoms. In this case, the person would be given a high dose of choline (one of the precursors of trimethylamine) and then have their urine tested for elevated levels of trimethylamine.

== Treatment ==

There is no known cure or treatment for the disorder. People affected by the disorder live relatively normal lives by managing their symptoms and with counseling. When the condition is suspected or known to occur in a family, genetic testing can be helpful in identifying the specific individuals who have or carry the disorder. 

Ways of reducing the fishy odor may include:

* Avoiding foods such as egg yolks, [[legumes]], red meats, fish, beans and other foods that contain [[choline]], [[carnitine]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]] and [[lecithin]]
* Taking low doses of antibiotics such as [[neomycin]] and [[metronidazole]]<ref name="metronidazole">{{cite journal

* Using slightly acidic detergent with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5

Additionally, at least one study<ref name="pmid15043988">{{cite journal | author=Yamazaki H, Fujieda M, Togashi M, ''et al.'' | title=Effects of the dietary supplements, activated charcoal and copper chlorophyllin, on urinary excretion of trimethylamine in Japanese trimethylaminuria patients |journal=Life Sci. | volume=74 | issue=22 | pages=2739–47 | year=2004 | doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2003.10.022 | pmid=15043988 }}</ref> has suggested that daily intake of the supplements [[activated charcoal]] and copper [[chlorophyllin]] may improve the quality of life of individuals afflicted with TMAU by helping their bodies to oxidize and convert TMA to the odorless ''N''-oxide (TMAO) metabolite. Study participants experienced subjective reduction in odor as well as objective reduction in TMA and increase in TMAO concentration measured in their urine. The study found that:
* 85% of test participants experienced complete loss of detectable "fishy" odor
* 10% experienced some reduction in detectable odor
* 5% did not experience any detectable odor reduction

== Genetics ==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Trimethylaminuria has an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern of inheritance.]]

Most cases of trimethylaminuria appear to be inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern, which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the altered gene. Carriers may have mild symptoms of trimethylaminuria or experience temporary episodes of fish-like body odor.

[[Mutation]]s in the ''FMO3'' [[gene]], which is found on the long arm of [[chromosome 1]], cause trimethylaminuria. The ''FMO3'' gene makes an [[enzyme]] that breaks down [[nitrogen]]-containing compounds from the diet, including trimethylamine. These compounds are produced by bacteria in the intestine as they digest proteins from [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[meat]], [[soy]], and other foods. Normally, the ''FMO3'' enzyme converts fishy-smelling trimethylamine into [[trimethylamine N-oxide|trimethylamine ''N''-oxide]] which has no odor. If the enzyme is missing or its activity is reduced because of a mutation in the ''FMO3'' gene, trimethylamine is not broken down and instead builds up in the body. As the compound is released in a person's sweat, urine, and breath, it causes the strong odor characteristic of trimethylaminuria. Researchers believe that stress and diet also play a role in triggering symptoms.

There are more than 40 known mutations associated with TMAU.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Hernandez D, Addou S, Lee D, Orengo C, Shephard EA, Phillips IR | title=Trimethylaminuria and a human FMO3 mutation database | journal=Hum Mutat | year=2003 | pages=209–13 | volume=22 | issue=3 | pmid=12938085 | doi=10.1002/humu.10252}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Furnes B, Feng J, Sommer SS, Schlenk D | title=Identification of novel variants of the flavin-containing monooxygenase gene family in African Americans | journal=Drug Metab Dispos | year=2003 | pages=187–93 | volume=31 | issue=2 | pmid=12527699 | doi=10.1124/dmd.31.2.187}}</ref> Loss-of-function [[mutation]]s, [[nonsense mutations]], and [[missense mutations]] are three of the most common. Nonsense and missense mutations cause the most severe [[phenotypes]]. 

Although ''FMO3'' mutations account for most known cases of trimethylaminuria, some cases are caused by other factors. A fish-like body odor could result from an excess of certain proteins in the diet or from an increase in bacteria in the digestive system. A few cases of the disorder have been identified in adults with [[liver]] damage caused by [[hepatitis]].

In 2007 the evolution of the ''FMO3'' gene was studied, including the evolution of some mutations associated with TMAU.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Allerston CK, Shimizu M, Fujieda M, Shephard EA, Yamazaki H, Phillips IR | title=Molecular evolution and balancing selection in the flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 gene (FMO3) | journal=Pharmacogenet Genomics. | year=2007 | pages=827–39 | volume=17 | issue=10 | pmid=17885620 | doi=10.1097/FPC.0b013e328256b198}}</ref>
