He practised in Lichfield, and it was by his advice that [[Dr Johnson]], when a child, was taken by his mother to be touched by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] for the [[king's evil]] on 30 March 1714. As a physician, Floyer was best known for introducing the practice of pulse rate measurement, and creating a special watch for this purpose. He was an advocate of cold bathing, and gave an early account of the pathological changes in the lungs associated with [[emphysema]].

Floyer was married to Mary Fleetwood of Lichfield, a widow, in April 1680.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=9-MUAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA512&lpg=PA512&dq=%22john+floyer%22+lichfield+knighted&source=bl&ots=zySug1vH88&sig=tDec2ZSBREqaCIAhASYVyBXUlnw&hl=en&ei=MbfNSrXJG4KCswPF36SzDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6#v=onepage&q=%22john%20floyer%22%20lichfield%20knighted&f=false Alumni Oxonienses: The Members of the University of Oxford, 1500&ndash;1714, Vol. II, Joseph Foster, Parker and Co., Oxford, 1891]</ref>
