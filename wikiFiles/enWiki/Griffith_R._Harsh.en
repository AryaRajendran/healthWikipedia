== Neurosurgical Advancements ==
Harsh has been credited with the creation of a device that assists in aggressive intratumoral radiation. In 2001, Stanford released news of this device and preliminary studies indicated that the risks associated with radiation therapy for brain tumors are noticeably lower when using this device. Approved by the FDA, the device was tested in a study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the Stanford Brain Tumor Center currently uses it in patients with newly diagnosed or recurring primary or metastatic brain tumors.<ref>{{cite web|title=New device delivers safer, targeted brain tumor treatment straight to the source|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2001/november14/gliasite.html|work=Stanford Report|accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref>

He has published over 100 clinical and scientific articles, including several identifying key pathways in brain tumorigenesis, appearing in PNAS, Science, and the New England Journal of Medicine.
