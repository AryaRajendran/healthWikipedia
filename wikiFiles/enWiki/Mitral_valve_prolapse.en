'''Mitral valve prolapse''' ('''MVP''') (aka primary form of myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve aka floppy mitral valve syndrome) is a [[valvular heart disease]] characterized by the displacement of an abnormally thickened [[mitral valve]] leaflet into the [[atria of the heart|left atrium]] during [[Systole (medicine)|systole]].<ref name="hayek"/> There are various types of MVP, broadly classified as classic and nonclassic. In its nonclassic form, MVP carries a low risk of [[complication (medicine)|complications]]. In severe cases of classic MVP, complications include [[mitral regurgitation]], [[infective endocarditis]], [[congestive heart failure]], and, in rare circumstances, [[cardiac arrest]], usually resulting in [[Sudden cardiac death|sudden death]].

The diagnosis of MVP depends upon [[echocardiography]], which uses [[ultrasound]] to visualize the mitral valve. The prevalence of MVP is estimated at 2-3% of the population.<ref name="hayek"/>

The condition was first described by [[John Brereton Barlow]] in 1966. In consequence, it may also be referred to as '''Barlow's Syndrome''',<ref name="pmid4159172">{{cite journal |author=Barlow JB, Bosman CK |title=Aneurysmal protrusion of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve.

==Overview==
[[Image:Zenon von Verona3.jpg|thumb|St. [[Zenon of Verona]] wearing a [[mitre]].]]

The [[mitral valve]], so named because of its resemblance to a [[bishop]]'s [[mitre]], is the [[heart valve]] that prevents the backflow of [[blood]] from the [[Ventricle (heart)|left ventricle]] into the [[atria of the heart|left atrium]] of the heart. It is composed of two leaflets, one anterior and one posterior, that close when the left ventricle contracts.

Each leaflet is composed of three layers of [[biological tissue|tissue]]: the ''atrialis'', ''fibrosa'', and ''spongiosa''. Patients with classic mitral valve prolapse have excess [[connective tissue]] that thickens the spongiosa and separates [[collagen]] bundles in the fibrosa. This is due to an excess of [[dermatan sulfate]], a [[glycosaminoglycan]].  This weakens the leaflets and adjacent tissue, resulting in increased leaflet area and elongation of the [[chordae tendineae]]. Elongation of the chordae tendineae often causes rupture, commonly to the chordae attached to the posterior leaflet. Advanced lesions—also commonly involving the posterior leaflet—lead to leaflet folding, inversion, and displacement toward the left atrium.<ref name="freshlook">{{cite journal |first1=David |last1=Playford |first2=Arthur |last2=Weyman |title=Mitral valve prolapse: time for a fresh look |journal=Reviews in Cardiovascular Medicine |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=73–81 |year=2001 |pmid=12439384 |doi= |url=http://www.medreviews.com/pubmed.cfm?j=2&v=2&i=2&p=73}}</ref>

==Subtypes==
[[Image:MVP subtypes.png|framed|378px|Diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse is based on modern [[echocardiography|echocardiographic]] techniques which can pinpoint abnormal leaflet thickening and other related pathology.]]

Prolapsed mitral valves are classified into several subtypes, based on leaflet thickness, concavity, and type of connection to the mitral annulus. Subtypes can be described as classic, nonclassic, symmetric, asymmetric, flail, or non-flail.<ref name="freshlook"/>

All measurements below refer to adult patients; applying them to children may be misleading.

===Classic versus nonclassic===
Prolapse occurs when the mitral valve leaflets are displaced more than 2 [[millimetre|mm]] above the [[mitral annulus]] high points. The condition can be further divided into classic and nonclassic subtypes based on the thickness of the mitral valve leaflets: up to 5&nbsp;mm is considered nonclassic, while anything beyond 5&nbsp;mm is considered classic MVP.<ref name="freshlook"/>

===Symmetric versus asymmetric===
Classical prolapse may be subdivided into symmetric and asymmetric, referring to the point at which leaflet tips join the mitral annulus. In symmetric coaptation, leaflet tips meet at a common point on the annulus. Asymmetric coaptation is marked by one leaflet displaced toward the atrium with respect to the other. Patients with asymmetric prolapse are susceptible to severe deterioration of the mitral valve, with the possible rupture of the [[chordae tendineae]] and the development of a flail leaflet.<ref name="freshlook"/>

===Flail versus non-flail===
Asymmetric prolapse is further subdivided into flail and non-flail. Flail prolapse occurs when a leaflet tip turns outward, becoming concave toward the left atrium, causing the deterioration of the mitral valve. The severity of flail leaflet varies, ranging from tip eversion to chordal rupture. Dissociation of leaflet and chordae tendineae provides for unrestricted motion of the leaflet (hence "flail leaflet"). Thus patients with flail leaflets have a higher prevalence of [[mitral regurgitation]] than those with the non-flail subtype.<ref name="freshlook"/>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Mitralinsuff TEE.jpg|thumb|400px|Transesophageal echocardiogram of mitral valve prolapse.]]
[[Echocardiography]] is the most useful method of diagnosing a prolapsed mitral valve. Two- and three-dimensional echocardiography are particularly valuable as they allow visualization of the mitral leaflets relative to the mitral annulus. This allows measurement of the leaflet thickness and their displacement relative to the annulus. Thickening of the mitral leaflets >5&nbsp;mm and leaflet displacement >2&nbsp;mm indicates classic mitral valve prolapse.<ref name="freshlook"/>

==Epidemiology==
Prior to the strict criteria for the diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse, as described above, the incidence of mitral valve prolapse in the general population varied greatly.<ref name="freshlook"/> Some studies estimated the incidence of mitral valve prolapse at 5 to 15 percent or even higher.<ref name="Levy-1987">{{cite journal | author=Levy D, Savage D. | title=Prevalence and clinical features of mitral valve prolapse | journal=Am Heart J | year=1987 | volume=113 | issue=5 | pages=1281–90 | pmid=3554946 | doi=10.1016/0002-8703(87)90956-2}}</ref> One study suggested MVP in up to 38% of healthy teenagers.<ref name="pmid3989128">{{cite journal |author=Warth DC, King ME, Cohen JM, Tesoriero VL, Marcus E, Weyman AE |title=Prevalence of mitral valve prolapse in normal children |journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=1173–7 |year=1985 |month=May |pmid=3989128 |doi=10.1016/S0735-1097(85)80021-8}}</ref>

Recent elucidation of mitral valve anatomy and the development of three-dimensional echocardiography have resulted in improved diagnostic criteria, and the true prevalence of MVP based on these criteria is estimated at 2-3%.<ref name="hayek"/> As part of the [[Framingham Heart Study]], for example, the prevalence of mitral valve prolapse in [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham, MA]] was estimated at 2.4%. There was a near-even split between classic and nonclassic MVP, with no significant age or sex discrimination.<ref name="Freed-1999">{{cite journal | author=Freed LA, Levy D, Levine RA, Larson MG, Evans JC, Fuller DL, Lehman B, Benjamin EJ. | title=Prevalence and clinical outcome of mitral-valve prolapse | journal=N Engl J Med | year=1999 | volume=341 | issue=1 | pages=1–7 | pmid=10387935 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199907013410101}}</ref> MVP is observed in 7% of autopsies in the [[United States]].<ref name="webmd"/>

[[Rheumatic fever]] is common worldwide and responsible for many cases of damaged [[heart valve]]s. Chronic [[rheumatic fever|rheumatic heart disease]] is characterized by repeated inflammation with fibrinous resolution.  The cardinal anatomic changes of the valve include leaflet thickening, commissural fusion, and shortening and thickening of the tendinous cords.<ref name=RobbinsPath>{{cite book |author=Cotran, Ramzi S.; Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelson; Nelso Fausto; Robbins, Stanley L.; Abbas, Abul K. |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-0187-1 |url=http://www.robbinspathology.com/ |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> The recurrence of rheumatic fever is relatively common in the absence of maintenance of low dose antibiotics, especially during the first three to five years after the first episode. Heart complications may be long-term and severe, particularly if valves are involved. While rheumatic fever since the advent of routine penicillin administration for Strep throat has become less common in developed countries, in the older generation and in much of the less-developed world, valvular disease (including mitral valve prolapse, reinfection in the form of valvular endocarditis, and valve rupture) from undertreated rheumatic fever continues to be a problem.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003940.htm  NLM/NIH: Medline Plus Medical Encyclopedia: Rheumatic fever]</ref>

In an Indian hospital between 2004 and 2005, 4 of 24 endocarditis patients failed to demonstrate classic vegetatations. All had rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and presented with prolonged fever. All had severe eccentric mitral regurigitation (MR). (One had severe aortic regurgitation (AR) also.) One had flail posterior mitral leaflet (PML).<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://drsvenkatesan.wordpress.com/2009/04/10/can-we-diagnose-infective-endocarditis-without-vegetation/|author=S Venkatesan, et al.|title=Can we diagnose Infective endocarditis without vegetation ? |journal=Indian Heart Journal|volume=59 |issue=5 |year=2007 |month=Sep-Oct}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
===Murmur===
Upon [[auscultation]] of an individual with mitral valve prolapse, a mid-systolic click, followed by a late systolic [[heart sounds|murmur]] heard best at the apex is common.

In contrast to most other heart murmurs, the murmur of mitral valve prolapse is accentuated by standing and [[valsalva maneuver]] (earlier systolic click and longer murmur) and diminished with squatting (later systolic click and shorter murmur).  The only other heart murmur that follows this pattern is the murmur of [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]].  A MVP murmur can be distinguished from a [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] murmur by 1) the presence of a mid-systolic click which is virtually diagnostic of MVP, and 2) the fact that hand grip maneuver intensifies the murmur of MVP<ref>Grewe, K. (1988). Differentiation of cardiac murmurs by dynamic auscultation.Current Problems in Cardiology, 13, 673–721.</ref> and diminishes the murmur of [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]]. The hand grip maneuver also diminishes the duration of the murmur and delays the timing of the mid-systolic click.<ref name="Tanser">Tanser, Paul H. (reviewed Mar 2007). [http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/sec07/ch076/ch076d.html "Mitral Valve Prolapse"], ''[http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/index.html The Merck Manuals Online Medical Library]'', Retrieved 2011-01-08.</ref> Hand grip maneuver increases [[total peripheral resistance]] ([[afterload]]) and therefore increases back pressure on the mitral valve resulting in a more intense murmur.

Both valsalva maneuver and standing decrease venous return to the heart thereby decreasing left ventricular diastolic filling ([[preload (cardiology)|preload]]) and causing more laxity on the [[chordae tendineae]].  This allows the mitral valve to prolapse earlier in [[systole (medicine)|systole]], leading to an earlier systolic click (i.e. closer to [[heart sounds|S<sub>1</sub>]]), and a longer murmur.

==Mitral valve prolapse syndrome==
Historically, the term '''mitral valve prolapse syndrome''' has been applied to MVP associated with [[palpitation]]s, atypical [[chest pain]], [[dyspnea on exertion]], low [[body mass index]], and [[electrocardiogram]] abnormalities in the setting of [[anxiety]], [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]], low [[blood pressure]], and other signs suggestive of [[autonomic nervous system]] dysfunction.<ref name="hayek">{{cite journal |author=Hayek E, Gring CN, Griffin BP |title=Mitral valve prolapse |journal=Lancet |volume=365 |issue=9458 |pages=507–18 |year=2005 |pmid=15705461 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)17869-6 |url=}}</ref>

Occasionally, supraventricular arrhythmias observed in MVP are associated with increased parasympathetic tone.<ref name="Terechtchenko-2003">{{cite journal | author=Terechtchenko L, Doronina SA, Pochinok EM, Riftine A. | title=Autonomic tone in patients with supraventricular arrhythmia associated with mitral valve prolapse in young men | journal=Pacing Clin Electrophysiol | year=2003 | volume=26 | issue=1 Pt 2 | pages=444–6 | pmid=12687863 | doi=10.1046/j.1460-9592.2003.00067.x}}</ref>

==Complications==
===Mitral regurgitation===
[[File:MI Schema schwer Kopie.svg|thumb|200px|Mitral valve prolapse can result in [[mitral regurgitation]], shown here, in which blood abnormally flows from the left ventricle into the left atrium.]]

Mitral valve prolapse is frequently associated with mild [[mitral regurgitation]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kolibash AJ |title=Progression of mitral regurgitation in patients with mitral valve prolapse |journal=Herz |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=309–17 |year=1988 |pmid=3053383 |doi=}}</ref> where blood aberrantly flows from the left ventricle into the left atrium during [[Systole (medicine)|systole]]. In the [[United States]], MVP is the most common cause of severe, non-ischemic mitral regurgitation.<ref name="hayek"/> This is occasionally due to rupture of the [[chordae tendineae]] that support the mitral valve.<ref name="Tanser" />

===Sudden death===
The MVP complications mitral regurgitation and [[congestive heart failure]] may, in turn, cause [[arrhythmia]]s and [[atrial fibrillation]] that may progress and lead to [[cardiac arrest|sudden death]]. However, there is no evidence that a prolapsed valve itself contributes to such arrythmias.<ref name="Fogoros">{{cite web |last=Fogoros  |first=Richard N.  |title=Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)  |url=http://heartdisease.about.com/library/weekly/aa073100b.htm |work=Heart Disease |publisher=About.com  |accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Generally, MVP is benign. However, MVP patients with a murmur, not just an isolated click, have an increased mortality rate of 15-20%.<ref name=webmd>{{eMedicine|emerg|316|Mitral Valve Prolapse}}</ref> The major predictors of [[death|mortality]] are the severity of mitral regurgitation and the [[ejection fraction]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Rodgers | first = Ellie | title = Mitral Valve Regurgitation | url=http://health.yahoo.com/topic/heart/treatment/article/healthwise/aa143455 | publisher=Healthwise, on Yahoo | date= May 11, 2004 | accessdate = 2007-07-11}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Individuals with mitral valve prolapse, particularly those without symptoms, often require no treatment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mitral valve prolapse|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/mitral-valve-prolapse/DS00504|publisher=Mayo Clinic}}</ref> Treatment with magnesium supplements may help reduce symptoms of MVP.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0002-9149(96)00865-X |last1=Lichodziejewska |first1=B |last2=Kłoś |first2=J |last3=Rezler |first3=J |last4=Grudzka |first4=K |last5=Dłuzniewska |first5=M |last6=Budaj |first6=A |last7=Ceremuzyński |first7=L |title=Clinical symptoms of mitral valve prolapse are related to hypomagnesemia and attenuated by magnesium supplementation. |journal=The American journal of cardiology |volume=79 |issue=6 |pages=768–72 |year=1997 |pmid=9070556}}</ref> Those with mitral valve prolapse and symptoms of dysautonomia (palpitations, chest pain) may benefit from beta-blockers (e.g., [[propranolol]]). Patients with prior stroke and/or atrial fibrillation may require blood thinners, such as [[aspirin]] or [[warfarin]]. In rare instances when mitral valve prolapse is associated with severe mitral regurgitation, mitral valve repair or [[mitral valve replacement|surgical replacement]] may be necessary. Mitral valve repair is generally considered preferable to replacement. Current ACC/AHA guidelines promote repair of mitral valve in patients before symptoms of heart failure develop. Symptomatic patients, those with evidence of diminished left ventricular function, or those with left ventricular dilatation need urgent attention. 

===Prevention of infective endocarditis===
Individuals with MVP are at higher risk of bacterial infection of the heart, called [[infective endocarditis]]. This risk is approximately three- to eightfold the risk of infective endocarditis in the general population.<ref name="hayek"/> Until 2007, the [[American Heart Association]] recommended prescribing [[antibiotics]] before invasive procedures, including those in dental surgery. Thereafter, they concluded that "prophylaxis for
dental procedures should be recommended only for patients with underlying cardiac conditions associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wilson W, Taubert KA, Gewitz M, ''et al.'' |title=Prevention of infective endocarditis: guidelines from the American Heart Association |journal=Journal of the American Dental Association (1939) |volume=138 |issue=6 |pages=739–45, 747–60 |year=2007 |pmid=17545263 |doi= |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.183095v1.pdf |format=PDF
}}</ref>

Many organisms responsible for endocarditis are slow-growing and may not be easily identified on routine blood cultures (these fastidious organisms require special culture media to grow). These include the [[HACEK_endocarditis|HACEK]] organisms, which are part of the normal oropharyngeal flora and are responsible for perhaps 5 - 10% of infective endocarditis affecting native valves. It is important when considering endocarditis to keep these organisms in mind.

==History==
The term ''mitral valve prolapse'' was coined by [[J. Michael Criley]] in 1966 and gained acceptance over the other descriptor of "billowing" of the mitral valve, as described by [[John Brereton Barlow]].<ref name="Barlow-1966">{{cite journal | author=Barlow JB, Bosman CK. | title=Aneurysmal protrusion of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve.
