Also known as "sexual headaches", '''coital cephalalgia''' is a rare type of severe [[headache]] that occurs at the base of the [[human skull|skull]] before [[orgasm]] during sexual activity, including [[masturbation]]. A [[pressor response]] to exercise has been suggested as a mechanism.<ref name="pmid731244">{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.41.10.930 |title=Coital cephalgia and ischaemic muscular work of the lower limbs |year=1978 |last1=Staunton |first1=H P |last2=Moore |first2=J |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry |volume=41 |issue=10 |pages=930}}</ref>

==Presentation==
The pain usually moves from the base of the skull through the head towards the [[frontal lobes]]. Extremely severe and sharp pain behind the eyes is also a symptom. The headaches usually have an immediate onset, with some gradually worsening during [[sexual intercourse]] and others (referred to as "explosive headaches") occurring almost instantaneously at the moment of orgasm. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The headache is usually worsened by movement. These headaches typically last for a few minutes to a few hours, although it is possible for such headaches to last up to a few days. <ref name="National Headache Foundation - Sexual Benign Headaches">{{cite web|title=Sexual Benign Headaches|url=http://www.headaches.org/education/Headache_Topic_Sheets/Sexual_Benign_Headaches|publisher=National Headache Foundation|accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref> 

Coital cephalalgia can frequently occur in a timeframe that [[exertion headaches]] occur.

==Epidemiology==
It is most common for men to experience these headaches for the first time in their early 20s, or between the ages of 35-44; the reason for this is unclear.

More prevalent in men, by a ratio of 3:1, these headaches appear in roughly 1% of the population, though it has been suggested that the prevalence may be higher, due to the embarrassment of presenting with the disorder, especially in cases where spontaneous remission occurs after a few days. Up to 10% of patients taking medication for erectile dysfunction may experience these headaches. If such symptoms are experienced by a patient, it is important for a physician to rule out a potential brain [[aneurysm]], or [[tumors]]. In most cases, these headaches are [[benign]]. More serious symptoms include a stiff neck, [[confusion]], and [[dizziness]].

==Treatment==
As for treatment, a [[physician]] may recommend reducing heavy sexual activity and [[masturbation]] for a short period of time ranging from a few days to a few weeks. In addition, physicians may recommend medications such as [[Propranolol]] that can be taken in advance of sexual activity to prevent such headaches.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Reduction in weight to a more ideal level and increased exercise may also reduce the likelihood of recurrences.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} A physician may wish to order a [[Computed tomography|CT scan]] to exclude [[intracranial bleeding]] or a mass lesion as a cause for this pain, however. in the absence of other symptoms this may not be routine. [[Indomethacin]] has also been tried.<ref name="pmid19495503">{{cite journal |author=Anand KS, Dhikav V |title=Primary headache associated with sexual activity |journal=Singapore Med J |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=e176–7 |year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19495503 |doi= |url=http://smj.sma.org.sg/5005/5005cr9.pdf}}</ref>
