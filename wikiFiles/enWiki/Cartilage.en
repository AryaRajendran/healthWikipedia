'''Cartilage''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑr|t|ɨ|l|ɨ|dʒ}} is a flexible [[connective tissue]] found in many areas in the bodies of humans and other animals, including the [[joint]]s between [[bone]]s, the [[rib cage]], the [[ear]], the [[nose]], the [[bronchial tubes]] and the [[intervertebral disc]]s. It is not as hard and rigid as [[bone]] but is stiffer and less flexible than [[muscle]]. 

Cartilage is composed of specialized cells called [[chondroblast]]s that produce a large amount of [[extracellular matrix]] composed of [[collagen]] fibers, abundant [[ground substance]] rich in [[proteoglycan]], and [[elastin]] fibers. Cartilage is classified in three types, ''[[elastic cartilage]]'', ''[[hyaline cartilage]]'' and ''[[fibrocartilage]]'', which differ in the relative amounts of these three main components.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pratt|first=Rebecca|title=Supporting Tissue: Cartilage|url=https://app.anatomyone.com/systemic/skeletal-system/supporting-tissue-cartilage#|work=AnatomyOne|publisher=Amirsys, Inc|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref>  Chondroblasts that get caught in the matrix are called [[chondrocyte]]s. They lie in spaces called lacunae with up to eight chondrocytes per lacuna. 

Unlike other connective tissues, cartilage does not contain blood vessels. The chondrocytes are supplied by [[diffusion]], helped by the pumping action generated by compression of the articular cartilage or flexion of the elastic cartilage. Thus, compared to other connective tissues, cartilage grows and repairs more slowly.

==Growth and development==
{{main|Chondrogenesis}}
[[File:Cartilage.jpg|thumb|Cartilage under a microscope]]
In [[embryogenesis]], the [[skeletal]] system is derived from the [[germ layer#Mesoderm|mesoderm]] germ layer. Chondrification (also known as chondrogenesis) is the process by which cartilage is formed from condensed [[mesenchyme]] tissue, which differentiates into [[chondroblasts]] and begins secreting the molecules that form the extracellular matrix.

Following the initial chondrification that occurs during embryogenesis, cartilage growth consists mostly of the maturing of immature cartilage to a more mature state. The division of cells within cartilage occurs very slowly, and thus growth in cartilage is usually not based on an increase in size or mass of the cartilage itself.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1063458407001987}}</ref> Articular cartilage function is dependent on the molecular composition of its extracellular matrix (ECM), which consists mainly of proteoglycans and collagens. Remodeling of cartilage is predominantly affected by changes and rearrangements of the collagen matrix, which responds to tensile and compressive forces experienced by the cartilage. <ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003986108001513}}</ref> Cartilage growth thus refers in most circles to matrix deposition, but can include both growth and remodeling of the extracellular matrix.

==Imaging==
Cartilage does not absorb [[x-ray]]s under normal [[In vivo]] conditions, but a dye can be injected into the [[synovial membrane]] that will cause the x-rays to be absorbed by the dye. The resulting void on the [[radiographic]] film between the [[bone]] and [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] represents the cartilage. For [[In vitro]] [[x-ray]] scans, the outer soft tissue is most likely removed so the cartilage and air boundary is enough to contrast the presence of cartilage due to [[refraction]] of the x-ray.<ref>[http://osteoarthritis.about.com/od/osteoarthritis101/a/cartilage.htm About.com:osteoarthritis]</ref>

== Diseases and treatment ==
{{main|Chondropathy}}

Several diseases can affect cartilage. [[Chondrodystrophies]] are a group of diseases characterized by disturbance of growth and subsequent [[ossification]] of cartilage. Some common diseases affecting/involving the cartilage are listed below.

* [[Osteoarthritis]]: The cartilage covering bones (articular cartilage—a subset of hyaline cartilage) is thinned, eventually completely worn out, resulting in a "bone against bone" joint, reduced motion, and pain. Osteoarthritis affects the joints exposed to high stress and is therefore considered the result of "wear and tear" rather than a true disease. It is treated by [[Arthroplasty]], the replacement of the joint by a synthetic joint often made of a Stainless Steel alloy ([[cobalt]] chromoly) and Ultra High Molecular Weight [[Polyethylene]] ([[UHMWPE]]). [[Chondroitin sulfate]], a [[monomer]] of the [[polysaccharide]] portion of [[proteoglycan]], has been claimed to reduce the symptoms of osteoarthritis, possibly by increasing the synthesis of the extracellular matrix, but recent research has not produced evidence to support this claim.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11330747 | work=BBC News | title=Supplements for osteoarthritis 'do not work' | date=16 September 2010}}</ref>
* Traumatic rupture or detachment: The cartilage in the [[knee]] is frequently damaged, and can be partially repaired through [[knee cartilage replacement therapy]]
* [[Achondroplasia]]: Reduced proliferation of chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate of long bones during infancy and childhood, resulting in [[dwarfism]].
* [[Costochondritis]]: Inflammation of cartilage in the ribs, causing [[chest pain]].
* [[Spinal disc herniation]] : Asymmetrical compression of an [[intervertebral disc]] ruptures the sac-like disc, causing a [[hernia]]tion of its soft content. The hernia often compresses the adjacent nerves and causes back pain.
* [[Relapsing polychondritis]]: a destruction, probably [[autoimmunity|autoimmune]], of cartilage, especially of the nose and ears, causing disfiguration. Death occurs by [[suffocation]] as the larynx loses its rigidity and collapses.

[[Tumor]]s made up of cartilage tissue, either [[benign tumor|benign]] or [[cancer|malignant]], can occur. They usually appear in bone, rarely in pre-existing cartilage. The benign tumors are called [[chondroma]], the malignant ones [[chondrosarcoma]]. Tumors arising from other tissues may also produce a cartilage-like matrix, the best known being [[pleomorphic adenoma]] of the [[salivary gland]]s. Conversely, chondrostatin, an ingredient of cartilage, is being investigated by [[Washington University School of Medicine|Washington University]] researchers for its potential ability to shrink breast and [[musculoskeletal]] tumors. 

The matrix of cartilage acts as a barrier, preventing the entry of [[lymphocytes]] or diffusion of [[immunoglobulins]]. This property allows for the [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] of cartilage from one individual to another without fear of tissue rejection.

===Repair===
Cartilage has limited repair capabilities: Because chondrocytes are bound in [[Lacuna (histology)|lacunae]], they cannot migrate to damaged areas. Therefore [[articular cartilage damage|cartilage damage]] is difficult to heal. Also, because hyaline cartilage does not have a blood supply, the deposition of new matrix is slow. Damaged hyaline cartilage is usually replaced by fibrocartilage scar tissue. Over the last years, surgeons and scientists have elaborated a series of [[articular cartilage repair|cartilage repair procedures]] that help to postpone the need for joint replacement.

[[Bioengineering]] techniques are being developed to generate new cartilage, using a cellular "scaffolding" material and [[Autologous chondrocyte implantation|cultured cells]] to grow artificial cartilage.<ref>[http://www.cartilage.org International Cartilage Repair Society ICRS]</ref>

== Mechanical Properties ==
The mechanical properties of articular cartilage in load bearing joints such as knee and hip have been studied extensively at macro, micro and nano-scales. These mechanical properties include the response of cartilage in frictional, compressive, shear and tensile loading. Cartilage displays [[viscoelastic]] properties.<ref>Hayes WC, Mockros LF. 1971. Viscoelastic properties of human articular cartilage. J. App. Physiology. Vol. 31, No. 4. [http://jap.physiology.org/content/31/4/562.full.pdf]</ref>

=== Frictional properties ===
[[Lubricin]], a glycoprotein abundant in cartilage and synovial fluid is playing a major role in biolubrication and wear protection of cartilage <ref>Rhee DK, Marcelino J, Baker MA, Gong Y, Smits P, et al. 2005. The secreted glycoprotein lubricin
protects cartilage surfaces and inhibits synovial cell overgrowth. J. Clin. Investig. 115:622–31.</ref>

==Cartilage in animals==
===Cartilaginous fish===
[[Chondrichthyes|Cartilaginous fish (chondrichthyes)]] like [[shark]]s, [[Batoidea|ray]]s and [[skate]]s have a skeleton composed entirely of cartilage. [[Shark cartilage]] is a popular but unproven dietary supplement.

===Invertebrate cartilage===
Cartilage tissue can also be found among invertebrates such as [[horseshoe crab]]s, marine [[snail]]s, and [[cephalopod]]s.
