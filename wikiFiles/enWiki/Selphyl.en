The "'''platelet-rich fibrin matrix'''" ('''PRFM''') method, marketed in the United States as '''Selphyl''' and also known as the '''vampire filler''' or '''vampire facelift''', is a process in [[cosmetic surgery]]. It is a way of extracting [[platelet]]s from the patient's own blood and using them as a [[dermal filler]] – that is, as a substance injected under the skin of the face to fill out [[Wrinkle (skin)|wrinkles]] so as to provide a more youthful appearance.<ref name="NYT 2 March">{{Cite news|last=Saint Louis|first=Catherine|title=‘Vampire Face-Lifts’: Smooth at First Bite|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/fashion/WEBSkin.html|accessdate=7 March 2011|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=2 March 2011}}</ref>

Selphyl is used in [[outpatient]] procedures that, {{As of|March 2011|lc=yes}}, costs about $900 to $1,500 in the U.S. and takes less than half an hour. Blood is drawn from the patient's arm and spun in a [[centrifuge]] to separate out the platelets, which are then injected back under the patient's facial skin. It can also be combined with other fillers such as [[Juvéderm]], and a procedure using this combination has been trademarked as "vampire facelift"."<ref name="NYT 2 March" />

Selphyl is available on the U.S. market since 2009. It was developed and is marketed by the [[Aesthetic Factors]] corporation.<ref name="NYT 2 March" /> The platelet extraction centrifuge used by Selphyl was cleared by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2002 as part of a blood collection system, "Fibrinet", for use by orthopedic doctors to speed tissue repair. {{As of|March 2011}} platelets extracted in this centrifuge have not been cleared or approved by the FDA for facial rejuvenation.<ref name="NYT 2 March" /> Nonetheless, Selphyl has been described as a "FDA approved dermal filler" in YouTube videos and trade publications.<ref name="NYT 2 March" />

The [[efficacy]] of Selphyl is contested. {{As of|March 2011}}, according to a ''[[New York Times]]'' report, it is attested by several plastic surgeons who use it but remains unproven by research.<ref name="NYT 2 March" /> [[Phil Haeck]], the president of the [[American Society of Plastic Surgeons]], dismissed the procedure as "creepy", "a gimmick" and as "antiquated as [[bloodletting]]".<ref name="NYT 2 March" /> In contrast, a February 2011 study
by [[Anthony P. Sclafani]], a paid consultant for the manufacturer of Selphyl,<ref name="NYT 2 March" /> concluded that "PRFM treatment is a well-tolerated, excellent choice for use in the face".<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Sclafani AP |title=Safety, Efficacy, and Utility of Platelet-Rich Fibrin Matrix in Facial Plastic Surgery |journal=Arch Facial Plast Surg |volume= 13|issue= 4|pages= 247–51|year=2011 |month=February |pmid=21339469 |doi=10.1001/archfacial.2011.3 |url=}}</ref>
