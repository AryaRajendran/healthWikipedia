'''Ergosterol''' (ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3β-ol) is a [[sterol]] found in fungi, and named for [[ergot]], a common name for the members of the fungal genus ''[[Claviceps]]'' from which ergosterol was first isolated. Ergosterol does not occur in plant or animal cells. It is a component of [[yeast]] and [[fungus|fungal]] [[cell membrane]]s, serving the same function [[cholesterol]] serves in [[animal]] [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. 

Ergosterol is occasionally reported analytically to occur in grasses such as [[rye]]<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21919518]</ref> and [[alfalfa]] (including alfalfa sprouts), and in plant flowers such as [[hops]].<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17760411]</ref>  However, such detection is usually assumed to be detection of fungal growth upon (and sometimes contamination of) the plant, as fungi form an integral part of the grass decay system. This ergosterol assay technique may thus be used to assay grass, grain, and feed systems for fungal content.<ref>[http://wwww.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_46/issue_3/0573.pdf]</ref><ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2400324]</ref>

Since ergosterol is the provitamin of vitamin D<sub>2</sub>, the UV radiation of fungus-bearing grass materials can result in vitamin D<sub>2</sub> production,<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6326678]</ref> but this is production of a form of vitamin D from fungus ergosterol (much as in UV radiation of yeasts and mushrooms) and is not true vitamin D production by the plant itself from UV light, a process that cannot happen.

== Vitamin D<sub>2</sub> precursor ==

Ergosterol is a biological precursor (a [[provitamin]]) to [[Vitamin D|vitamin D<sub>2</sub>]]. It is turned into viosterol by [[ultraviolet]] light, and is then converted into [[ergocalciferol]], a form of vitamin D also known as D<sub>2</sub> or D2.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rajakumar K, Greenspan SL, Thomas SB, Holick MF |title=SOLAR ultraviolet radiation and vitamin D: a historical perspective |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=97 |issue=10 |pages=1746–54 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17761571 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2006.091736 |url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17761571 |pmc=1994178}}</ref> For this reason, when yeast (such as [[brewer's yeast]]) and fungi (such as mushrooms), are exposed to ultraviolet light, significant amounts of vitamin D<sub>2</sub> are produced. Such vitamin D<sub>2</sub> serves as the only available dietary source of vitamin D for [[vegan|those who eat no animal products]], although such persons can obtain ample vitamin D through [[Vitamin_D#Production_in_the_skin|exposure to sunlight]]. 

A related process of producing food vitamin D from fungi (though not a process acceptable to vegans) occurs when milk-cows are fed diets of UV-irradiated-yeast (which contains D<sub>2</sub> produced from the ergosterol in the yeast). This form of the vitamin is eventually excreted as D<sub>2</sub> in cow milk. However, this process for increasing vitamin D in milk was never as common as "supplementing" milk directly, by adding vitamin D<sub>3</sub> to the milk. It was also not as common as the earlier [[Harry Steenbock|Steenbock process]], in which milk was exposed directly to ultraviolet light, which converts milk's natural [[7-dehydrocholesterol]] content to vitamin D<sub>3</sub>.

== Target for antifungal drugs ==

Because ergosterol is present in cell membranes of fungi, yet absent in those of animals, it is a useful target for [[antifungal drug]]s.  Ergosterol is also present in the cell membranes of some protists, such as [[Trypanosomatida|trypanosome]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Roberts CW, McLeod R, Rice DW, Ginger M, Chance ML, Goad LJ |title=Fatty acid and sterol metabolism: potential antimicrobial targets in apicomplexan and trypanosomatid parasitic protozoa |journal=Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. |volume=126 |issue=2 |pages=129–42 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12615312 |doi=10.1016/S0166-6851(02)00280-3}}</ref> This is the basis for the use of some antifungals against West African [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]].

[[Amphotericin B]], an antifungal drug, targets ergosterol.  It binds physically to ergosterol within the membrane, and, thus, creates a polar pore in fungal membranes.  This causes ions (predominantly [[potassium]] and [[protons]]) and other molecules to leak out, which will kill the cell.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ellis D |title=Amphotericin B: spectrum and resistance |journal=J. Antimicrob. Chemother. |volume=49 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=7–10 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11801575 |url=http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11801575 |doi=10.1093/jac/49.suppl_1.7}}</ref> Amphotericin B has been replaced by safer agents in most circumstances, but is still used, despite its side effects, for life-threatening fungal or protozoan infections.

[[Miconazole]], [[itraconazole]], and [[clotrimazole]] work in a different way, inhibiting synthesis of ergosterol from lanosterol. Ergosterol is a smaller molecule than lanosterol; it is synthesized by combining two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate, a 15-carbon-long terpenoid, into lanosterol, which has 30 carbons. Then, two methyl groups are removed, making ergosterol. The "azole" class of antifungal agents [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibit]] the [[enzyme]] that performs these [[demethylation]] steps in the biosynthetic pathway between lanosterol and ergosterol.

== Other uses ==

Ergosterol is also used as an indicator of fungal biomass in soil. Though it does degrade over time, if kept below freezing in a dark environment, this degradation can be slowed or even stopped completely.

Research has shown ergosterol may have [[antitumor]] properties.<ref name="Yazawa2000">{{cite journal

== Toxicity ==

Ergosterol powder is an irritant to skin, eyes, and the respiratory tract. Ingestion of large amounts can cause [[hypercalcemia]], which (if prolonged) can lead to calcium salt deposits in the soft tissues and, in particular, the kidneys.<ref>[http://fscimage.fishersci.com/msds/28224.htm Material Safety Data Sheet], Fisher Scientific</ref>
