The appearance may be alarming, but it is a harmless condition. Predisposing factors include smoking, [[xerostomia]] (dry mouth), soft diet, poor oral hygiene and certain medications. Management is by improving oral hygiene, especially scraping or brushing the tongue.<ref name="Sarti 1990">{{cite journal|last=Sarti|first=GM|coauthors=Haddy, RI; Schaffer, D; Kihm, J|title=Black hairy tongue.|journal=American family physician|date=1990 Jun|volume=41|issue=6|pages=1751–5|pmid=2190456}}</ref>

==Classification==
[[File:Black tongue.jpg|thumbnail|Black discoloration on the dorsal surface of the tongue. Black hairy tongue is characterized by a hairy and discolored tongue.]]
'''Hairy tongue''' (lingua villosa) refers to a marked accumulation of [[keratin]] on the filiform papillae on the dorsal surface of the tongue, giving a hair-like appearance.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook">{{cite book|last=Bouquot|first=Brad W.

However, the elongated papillae of hairy tongue usually develop discoloration due to growth of pigment producing bacteria and staining from food.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> Hence the term '''black hairy tongue''', although hairy tongue may also be discolored yellow or brown. Transient, surface discoloration that is not associated with hairy tongue can be brushed off.<ref name="OMF medicine textbook">{{cite book|last=Scully|first=Crispian|title=Oral and maxillofacial medicine : the basis of diagnosis and treatment|year=2008|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780443068188|edition=2nd ed.|page=349}}</ref> '''Drug induced black hairy tongue''' specifically refers to BHT that develops because of medication.<ref name="Thompson 2010">{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=DF|coauthors=Kessler, TL|title=Drug-induced black hairy tongue.|journal=Pharmacotherapy|date=2010 Jun|volume=30|issue=6|pages=585–93|pmid=20500047}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Hairy tongue largely occurs in the central part of the dorsal tongue, just anterior (in front) of the [[circumvallate papilla]]e, although sometimes the entire dorsal surface may be involved.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> Discoloration usually accompanies hairy tongue, and may be yellow, brown or black.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> Apart from the appearance, the condition is typically asymptomatic, but sometimes people may experience a gagging sensation or a bad taste.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> There may also be associated oral malodor (intra-oral [[halitosis]]).<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" />

==Causes==
The cause is uncertain,<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> but it is thought to be caused by accumulation of [[Stratified squamous epithelium|epithelial squames]] and proliferation of chromogenic (color producing) micro-organisms.<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" /> There may be an increase in keratin production or a decrease in normal desquamation (shedding of surface epithelial cells).<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> Many people with BHT are heavy smokers.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> Other possible associated factors are poor oral hygiene,<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> general debilitation,<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> [[hyposalivation]] (decreased salivary flow rate),<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" /> radiotherapy,<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> overgrowth of fungal or bacterial organisms,<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> and a soft diet.<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" /> Occasionally, BHT may be caused by the use of antimicrobial medications e.g. [[tetracycline]]s,<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" /> or oxidizing mouthwashes or [[antacid]]s.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> A soft diet may be involved as normally food has an abrasive action on the tongue, which keeps the filiform papillae short. [[Pellagra]], a condition caused by a vitamin deficiency, may cause a thick greyish fur to develop on the dorsal tongue, along with other oral signs.<ref name="Cawson 2002">{{cite book|last=Cawson|first=R. A.|title=Cawson's essentials of oral pathology and oral medicine|year=2002|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0443071055|edition=7th ed.|coauthors=Odell, E. W.|page=351}}</ref>  

Transient surface discoloration of the tongue and other soft tissues in the mouth can be occur in the absence of hairy tongue. Causes include smoking (or betel chewing),<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" /> some foods and beverages (e.g. coffee, tea or liquorice),<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" /> and certain medications e.g. [[chlorhexidine]],<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" /> iron salts,<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" /> or [[bismuth subsalicylate]] (Pepto-Bismol).<ref name="Cohen 2009">{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=PR|title=Black tongue secondary to bismuth subsalicylate: case report and review of exogenous causes of macular lingual pigmentation.|journal=Journal of drugs in dermatology : JDD|date=2009 Dec|volume=8|issue=12|pages=1132–5|pmid=20027942}}</ref><!-- pmid20027942 is listed as a review on pubmed, but I am not sure if it is actually a primary source... -->

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is usually made on the clinical appearance without the need for a tissue [[biopsy]].<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> However, when biopsies have been taken, the [[histology|histologic]] appearance is one of marked elongation and [[parakeratosis|hyperparakeratosis]] of the filiform papillae and numerous bacteria growing on the epithelial surface.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> 

Hairy tongue may be confused with [[hairy leukoplakia]], however the latter usually occurs on the sides of the tongue and is associated with [[Epstein-Barr virus]], [[human immunodeficiency virus]] or other conditions which suppress the immune system.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" />

==Treatment==
Treatment is by reassurance, as the condition is benign, and then by correction of any predisposing factors.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> This may be cessation of smoking or cessation/substitution of implicated medications or mouthwashes. Generally direct measures to return the tongue to its normal appearance involve improving oral hygiene, especially scraping or brushing the tongue before sleep.<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" /> This promotes desquamation of the hyperparakeratotic papillae.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> Keratolytic agents (chemicals to remove keratin) such as [[podophyllin]] are successful, but carry safety concerns.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> Other reported successful measures include [[sodium bicarbonate]] mouthrinses,<!-- <ref name="OMF pathology textbook" />  --> eating pineapple,<!-- <ref name="OMF pathology textbook" />  --> sucking on a peach stone<!-- <ref name="OMF pathology textbook" />  --> and chewing gum.<ref name="OMF medicine textbook" />

==Prognosis==
BHT is a benign condition,<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> but people who are affected may be distressed at the appearance and possible halitosis, and therefore treatment is indicated.

==Epidemiology==
Hairy tongue occurs in about 0.5% of adults.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> However, the prevalence is variable depending on the population studied.<ref name="Thompson 2010" />

==History==
In 1937, Conrad Elvehjem, showed the vitamin [[niacin]] cured [[pellagra]] in dogs, which was manifested as black tongue.{{medical citation needed|date=February 2013}}
