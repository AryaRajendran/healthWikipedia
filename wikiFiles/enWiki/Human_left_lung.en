The human '''left lung''' is divided into two lobes, an upper and a lower, by the [[oblique fissure]], which extends from the [[rib|costal]] to the [[mediastinal surface of the lung]] both above and below the [[Hilum of lung|hilum]]. 

As seen on the surface, this fissure begins on the [[mediastinal surface of the lung]] at the upper and posterior part of the hilum, and runs backward and upward to the [[posterior border of the lung|posterior border]], which it crosses at a point about 6 cm. below the [[apex of the lung|apex]]. 

It then extends downward and forward over the costal surface, and reaches the lower border a little behind its anterior extremity, and its further course can be followed upward and backward across the mediastinal surface as far as the lower part of the hilum. 

==Impressions==
On the mediastinal surface, immediately above the hilum, is a well-marked curved furrow produced by the [[aortic arch]], and running upward from this toward the apex is a groove accommodating the [[left subclavian artery]]; a slight impression in front of the latter and close to the margin of the lung lodges the [[left innominate vein]]. 

Behind the hilum and pulmonary ligament is a vertical furrow produced by the [[descending aorta]], and in front of this, near the base of the lung, the lower part of the [[esophagus]] causes a shallow impression.
