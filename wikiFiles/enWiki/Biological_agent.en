A '''biological agent''' — also called '''bio-agent''' or '''biological threat agent''' — is a [[bacterium]], [[virus]], [[protozoan]], [[parasite]], or [[fungus]] that can be used purposefully as a biological weapon in [[bioterrorism]] or [[biological warfare]] (BW).<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/biologicalagents/index.html|title=Biological Agents |publisher= United States Department of Labor: OSHA|accessdate=2012-05-31}}</ref> In addition to these living and/or replicating [[pathogens]], [[toxin|biological toxin]]s are also included among the bio-agents. More than 1,200 different kinds of potentially weaponizable bio-agents have been described and studied to date. 

Biological agents have the ability to adversely affect [[health|human health]] in a variety of ways, ranging from relatively mild [[allergy|allergic reactions]] to serious medical conditions, including [[death]]. Many of these organisms are ubiquitous in the [[natural environment]] where they are found in water, soil, plants, or animals.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/biologicalagents/index.html|title=Biological Agents |publisher= United States Department of Labor: OSHA|accessdate=2012-05-31}}</ref> Bio-agents may be amenable to "weaponization" to render them easier to deploy or disseminate. Genetic modification may enhance their incapacitating or lethal properties, or render them impervious to conventional treatments or preventives. Since many bio-agents reproduce rapidly and require minimal resources for propagation, they are also a potential danger in a wide variety of occupational settings.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/biologicalagents/index.html|title=Biological Agents |publisher= United States Department of Labor: OSHA|accessdate=2012-05-31}}</ref>

The [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (1972) is an international treaty banning the use or stockpiling of bio-agents; it currently has 165 state signatories. Bio-agents are, however, widely studied for defensive purposes under various [[biosafety levels]] and within [[biocontainment]] facilities throughout the world. In 2008, according to a U.S. [[Congressional Research Service]] report, [[China]], [[Cuba]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[North Korea]], [[Russia]], [[Syria]] and [[Taiwan]] were considered, with varying degrees of certainty, to be maintaining bio-agents in an offensive BW program capacity.

==Classifications==

===Operational===
The former [[US biological warfare program]] (1943-1969) categorized its weaponized anti-personnel bio-agents as either '''Lethal Agents''' (''Bacillus anthracis'', ''Francisella tularensis'', Botulinum toxin) or '''Incapacitating Agents''' (''Brucella suis'', ''Coxiella burnetii'', Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B).

===Legal===
Since 1997, [[United States]] law has declared a list of bio-agents designated by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] or the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] that have the "potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety" to be officially defined as "[[select agents]]" and possession or transportation of them are tightly controlled as such.<ref>''Additional Requirements for Facilities Transferring or Receiving Select Agents'', Title 42 CFR Part 72 and Appendix A; 15 April 1997 (DHHS).</ref>

===Regulatory===
The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) breaks biological agents into three categories: [[Bioterrorism#Types of agents|Category A, Category B, and Category C]]. Category A agents pose the greatest threat to the US. Criteria for being a Category A agent include high rates of morbidity and mortality; ease of dissemination and communicablitily; ability to cause public panic; and special action require by the public health field to respond. Category A agents include anthrax, botulism, plague, smallpox, tularemia, and viral hemorrhagic fevers.
