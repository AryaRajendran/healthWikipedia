A '''biomedical scientist''' ('''biomedician''', '''biomedical doctor''', '''medical scientist''', '''clinical scientist''') is a [[scientist]] trained in [[biology]], particularly in the context of [[medicine]]. These scientists work to gain knowledge on the main principles of how the human body works and to find new ways to cure or treat [[disease]] by developing advanced [[diagnostic test|diagnostic tools]] or new [[therapy|therapeutic strategies]]. The [[research]] of biomedical scientists is referred to as [[biomedical research]].

Biomedical scientists can have a particular focus on [[Pure research|basic]], [[pre-clinical development|pre-clinical]], or [[translational research]]. While biomedical scientists specifically focus on understanding the human body and disease, scientists educated in other fields also contribute greatly to advancements in medical knowledge, including [[biologist]]s, [[biomedical engineer]]s, [[chemist]]s, and [[physicist]]s.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the term ''"biomedical scientist"'' as related to the health service has a different meaning than in other parts of the world, specifically referring to a class of [[Allied health professional|healthcare professional]] that performs [[clinical pathology]] services.

== Description ==
The specific activities of the biomedical scientist can differ in various parts of the world and vary with the level of education. Generally speaking, biomedical scientists conduct research in a [[laboratory]] setting, using living organisms as [[model organism|models]] to conduct [[experiment]]s. These can include [[cell culture|cultured human or animal cells]] grown outside of the whole organism, small animals such as [[Drosophila melanogaster|flies]], [[Caenorhabditis elegans|worms]], [[zebrafish|fish]], [[House mouse|mice]], and [[Brown rat|rat]]s, or, rarely, larger animals and [[primate]]s. Biomedical scientists may also work directly with human tissue specimens to perform experiments as well as participate in [[clinical research]].

Biomedical scientists employ a variety of techniques in order to carry out laboratory experiments. These include:
*Molecular and biochemical techniques
**[[Electrophoresis]] and [[Blot (biology)|blotting]]
**[[Immunostaining]]
**[[Chromatography]]
**[[Mass spectrometry]]
**[[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] and [[sequencing]]
**[[Microarray]]s
*Imaging technologies
**[[Optical microscope|Light]], [[Fluorescence microscope|fluorescence]], and [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]]
**[[MRI]]
**[[Positron emission tomography|PET]]
**[[radiography|X-ray]]
*[[Gene]]tic engineering/modification
**[[Transfection]]
**[[Transduction (genetics)|Viral transduction]]
**[[Transgenic organisms|Transgenic model organisms]]
*[[Electrophysiology]] techniques
**[[Patch clamp]]
**[[EEG]], [[EKG]], [[Electroretinography|ERG]]
*''[[In silico]]'' techniques
**[[Bioinformatics]]
**[[Computational biology]]

===Level of education===
Biomedical scientists typically obtain a [[terminal degree|terminal academic degree]], usually a [[doctorate]]. (PhD, DSc, DPhil, etc.) This degree is necessary for faculty positions at academic institutions, as well as senior scientist positions at most companies. Some biomedical scientists also possess a medical degree ([[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]], MBBS, etc.) in addition to an academic degree.

===Work environment===
====Academics====
This category includes [[tenure]]d [[Faculty (university)|faculty]] positions at [[university|universities]], [[college]]s, non-profit [[research institute]]s, and sometimes [[hospital]]s. These positions usually afford more intellectual freedom and give the researcher more latitude in the direction and content of the research. Scientists in academic settings, in addition to conducting experiments, will also attend [[academic conference|scientific conferences]], compete for [[funding of science|research grant funding]], publish [[scientific journal|scientific papers]], and teach classes.

====Industry====
Industry jobs refer to private sector jobs at for-profit corporations. In the case of biomedical scientists, employment is usually at large [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] or [[biotechnology]] companies. Positions in industry tend to pay higher salaries than those at academic institutions, but job security compared to tenured academic faculty is significantly less. Researchers in industry tend to have less intellectual freedom in their research than those in the academic sector, owing to the ultimate goal of producing marketable products that benefit the company.

====Non-Traditional Career Paths====
In recent years, more biomedical scientists have pursued careers where advanced education and experience in biomedical research is needed outside of traditional laboratory research. These areas include [[patent law]], [[consultant|consulting]], [[public policy]], and [[science journalism]].  The primary reason for growth in these areas is that in recent years fewer positions are available in traditional academic research relative to the number of seekers; approximately 15-20% of PhD life scientists will obtain a tenure-track position or lab-head position in industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hypothesisjournal.com/pdfs/vol6num1/17.pdf |title=The Scientific Workforce Policy Debate: Do We Produce too Many Biomedical Trainees? | accessdate=19 November 2011 }}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
{{Refimprove|date=April 2007}}

"Biomedical scientist" is the protected title used by professionals qualified to work unsupervised within the [[pathology]] department of a [[hospital]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Biomedical Scientist as Expert Witness |author= Paul D. Ellner|year= 2006|publisher=ASM Press|isbn=1-55581-345-3}}</ref> The [[biomedical science]]s are made up of the following disciplines; [[biochemistry]], [[haematology]], [[immunology]], [[microbiology]], [[histology]], [[cell biology|cytology]], [[bacteriology]] and [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] services. These professions are regulated within the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Health professions council]]. Anyone who falsely claims to be a biomedical scientist commits an offence and could be [[Fine (penalty)|fined]] up to [[Pound sterling|Â£]]5000.

Each department specialises in aiding the [[diagnosis]] and treatment of disease. Entry to the profession requires an [[Institute of Biomedical Science]] (IBMS) accredited [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] [[honours degree]] followed by a minimum of 12 months [[laboratory]] training in one of the pathology disciplines, however the actual time spent training can be considerably longer. Trainees are also required to complete a certificate of competence training portfolio, this requires gathering extensive amounts of evidence to demonstrate professional competence. At the end of this period the trainees portfolio and overall competence are assessed if successful state registration is achieved. State registration indicates that the applicant has reached a required standard of education and will follow the guidelines and codes of practice created by the health professions council.More recently a co-terminus degree has been implemented to bring the profession into line with the other professions allied to health care. Students now participate in a placement year,which lasts 15 weeks, in either the second or third years of their degree. Students are then awarded their state registration on completion of their degree. Placements are not guaranteed and places are limited to the top students, those who do not get placements can follow the old style of registration but are at a serious disadvantage when applying for posts.

Biomedical scientists are the second largest profession registered by the [[Health Professions Council]] and make up a vital component of the health care team. Many of the decisions doctors make are based on the test results generated by biomedical scientists. Despite this, much of the general public are unaware of biomedical scientists and the important role they play. This lack of awareness extends to many doctors and nurses; often biomedical scientists are incorrectly referred to as laboratory technicians.

Biomedical scientists are not confined to [[National Health Service|NHS]] laboratories. Biomedical scientists along with scientists in other inter-related medical disciplines seek out to understand human anatomy, genetics, immunology, physiology and behaviour at all levels. This is sometimes achieved through the use of model systems that are homologous to various aspects of human biology. The research that is carried out either in Universities or Pharmaceutical companies by biomedical scientists has led to the development of new treatments for a wide range of degenerative and genetic disorders. [[Stem cell]] biology, [[cloning]], [[genetic testing|genetic screening]]/therapies and other areas of biomedical science have all been generated by the work of biomedical scientists from around the world. Leading UK biomedical science academics and researchers include: Prof Mark Ferguson, Prof P G (Gerry) McKenna MRIA, Prof David Rogers, Prof Val Randall and Prof Robert May.

==Education==
Biomedical science graduate programs are maintained at academic institutions and medical schools around the world, and some biomedical graduate programs are administered jointly by an academic institution and a business, hospital, or independent research institute. While [[graduate students]] historically committed to a particular research specialty, such as [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[genetics]], or [[developmental biology]], the recent trend (particularly in the United States) is to offer interdisciplinary programs that do not specialize and instead aim to incorporate a broad education in multiple biological disciplines.  Historically people entering biomedical graduate programs have held a master's degree, although many universities (particularly in the United States) currently accept applicants holding a bachelor's degree with exceptional credentials such as high undergraduate GPA and entry examination scores as well as extensive research experience. 

Initially, biomedical graduate students usually rotate through the laboratories of several faculty researchers, after which the student commits to joining a particular laboratory for the remainder of his or her tenure. The remaining time is spent conducting original research under the direction of the [[principal investigator]] to complete and publish a [[dissertation]]. Unlike undergraduate and [[professional schools]], there is no set time period for graduate education. Students graduate once a thesis project of significant scope to justify the writing of their dissertation has been completed, a point that is determined by the student's principal investigator as well as his or her faculty advisory committee. The average time to graduation can vary between institutions, but most programs average around 5â6 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umassmed.edu/bbs/admissions/faq.aspx#FAQ13

Biomedical scientists typically study in undergraduate majors that are focused on biological sciences, such as [[biochemistry]], [[microbiology]], [[zoology]], [[biophysics]], etc.

===United Kingdom (England, Wales, and Northern Ireland)===
Education programmes<ref>http://www.ibms.org/go/education-development:ibms-courses</ref> have traditionally encompassed an initial [[bachelors degree]], which is presupposed for two years of further studies eventually earning the students a ''medicine master's examina''. Many students choose to study on (for as much as) another 4 years to earn a PhD degree, at this time the students specialize in a certain areas such as [[nephrology]], [[neurology]], [[oncology]] or [[virology]]. 

In the UK specifically, prospective undergraduate students wishing to undertake a BSc in biomedical sciences are required to apply via the [[UCAS]] application system (usually during the final year of college or sixth form secondary school). Although many students are genuinely interested in pursuing this degree, a small proportion of places offered on biomedical science courses around the country are made available to those applicants who are unsuccessful in applying for Medicine. As a result, those who are unable to gain admittance into undergraduate medicine courses often re-apply as postgraduates upon completion of their three year BSc degree. 

A [[Doctor of Science|PhD in Biomedicine]] is however required for most higher [[research]] and [[teacher|teaching]] positions, which most [[college]]s and [[universities]] offer.<ref name="WiHC"/> These [[graduate degree]] programs may include [[classroom]] and [[fieldwork]], research at a [[laboratory]], and a [[dissertation]]. Although a degree in a [[medicine]] or [[biology]] (biochemistry, microbiology, zoology, biophysics) is common, recent research [[project]]s also need graduates in [[statistics]], [[bioinformatics]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. Abilities preferred for entry in this field include: technical, scientific, numerical, written, and oral [[skill]]s.

University departments offering degree programmes and/or research in biomedical science are represented by the Heads of University Centres of Biomedical Science (HUCBMS). HUCBMS has an international membership.

== Areas of specialization ==
Biomedical scientists can focus on several areas of [[Specialty (medicine)|specialty]],<ref name="WiHC">{{cite web |url=http://wihealthcareers.org/Career_occ_view.cfm?o_id=62 |title=Health Careers |accessdate=2007-03-11 }}</ref> including:

*[[Biochemistry]]: studies the [[chemical]] composition of [[cell (biology)|cells]] and the chemistry behind biological processes
*[[Molecular biology]]: studies the [[molecular]] makeup and processes of living [[organisms]]
*[[Biophysics]]: studies [[Mechanical energy|mechanical]] and [[Electrical energy|electrical]] [[energy]] in living [[Cell (biology)|cells]] and [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s
*[[Cell biology]]: studies cell-level organization and processes
*[[Cytopathology]]: Studies cell obtained by different means from human and sometimes animal bodies, using microscope and recent technologies to evaluate morphology, molecular pathology changes by molecular diagnostics. Also cytopathology involves cancer screening such cervical, breast, colon and prostate cancers.
*[[Computational biology]] and [[Bioinformatics]]: uses [[computer simulation|computer modeling]] and [[data analysis]] to understand biological systems
*[[Developmental biology]]: studies the growth and development of organisms and focuses on diseases of abnormal development
*[[Epidemiology]]: studies the incidence and transmission of diseases in a [[population]] and population characteristics ([[Human behavior|behaviors]], [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], etc.) that associate with diseases
*[[Genetics]]: studies [[DNA]] and [[gene]]s of [[human]]s and animals, as well as diseases caused by abnormal or [[mutation|mutated]] DNA.
*[[Hematology]]: studies of the [[blood]], such as [[blood cell]]s, and mechanisms of [[coagulation]].
*[[Histopathology]]: Studies tissues for disease diagnosis, using histological, histochemical, immunohistochemical analysis or molecular techniques for diagnostics.
*[[Immunology]]: studies the [[immune system]]
*[[Microbiology]]: studies characteristics of [[microorganism]]s such as [[bacteria]] and their role in human health
*[[Neuroscience]]: studies on function and structure the [[nervous system]], including the [[brain]]
*[[Oncology]] (a.k.a. cancer biology): studies the causes and characteristics of [[cancer]]
*[[Parasitology]]: studies [[parasite]]s
*[[Pathology]]: studies the underlying causes and bodily effects of disease through examination of [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s, [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s, and cells
*[[Pharmacology]]: studies effects of [[drug]]s on biological systems
*[[Physiology]]: studies how various [[body system]]s function at macroscopic, microscopic and molecular levels
*[[Virology]]: studies [[virus]]es and viral diseases
 
However, recent trends in biomedical graduate education (particularly in the United States) are for biomedical scientists to remain interdisciplinary and to not specialize. This approach emphasizes focus on a particular body or disease process as a whole and drawing upon the techniques of multiple specialties. (''See also: [[Systems biology]]'')
