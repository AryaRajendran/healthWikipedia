'''Leukemia''' ([[American English]]) or '''leukaemia''' ([[British English]]) is a type of [[cancer]] of the [[blood]] or [[bone marrow]] characterized by an abnormal increase of immature [[white blood cell]]s called "[[Precursor cell|blasts]]". Leukemia is a broad term covering a spectrum of diseases. In turn, it is part of the even broader group of diseases affecting the blood, bone marrow, and [[lymphatic system|lymphoid system]], which are all known as [[Hematological malignancies|hematological neoplasms]]. 

Leukemia is a treatable disease.  Most treatments involve [[chemotherapy]], [[medical radiation therapy]], or [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormone treatments]].  The rate of [[cure]] depends on the type of leukemia as well as the age of the patient.  Children are more likely to be permanently cured than adults.  Even when a complete cure is unlikely, most people with a chronic leukemia and many people with an acute leukemia can be successfully treated for years.

Leukemia can affect people at any age.  In 2000 approximately 256,000 children and adults around the world developed some form of leukemia, and 209,000 died from it.<ref name=Numbers /><!-- These numbers can be found on page four, at the bottom of Table 1 in the named source -->  About 90% of all leukemias are diagnosed in adults.<ref>{{cite web

Clinically and pathologically, leukemia is subdivided into a variety of large groups. The first division is between its ''[[Acute (medical)|acute]]'' and ''[[chronic (medicine)|chronic]]'' forms:
* '''[[Acute leukemia]]''' is characterized by a rapid increase in the number of immature blood cells.   Crowding due to such cells makes the bone marrow unable to produce healthy blood cells. Immediate treatment is required in acute leukemia due to the rapid progression and accumulation of the malignant cells, which then spill over into the bloodstream and spread to other organs of the body. Acute forms of leukemia are the most common forms of [[childhood leukemia|leukemia in children]]
* '''[[Chronic leukemia]]''' is characterized by the excessive build up of relatively mature, but still abnormal, white blood cells. Typically taking months or years to progress, the cells are produced at a much higher rate than normal, resulting in many abnormal white blood cells. Whereas acute leukemia must be treated immediately, chronic forms are sometimes monitored for some time before treatment to ensure maximum effectiveness of therapy. Chronic leukemia mostly occurs in older people, but can theoretically occur in any age group.

Additionally, the diseases are subdivided according to which kind of blood cell is affected. This split divides leukemias into lymphoblastic or ''[[lymphocytic leukemia]]s'' and myeloid or ''[[myelogenous leukemia]]s'':
* In lymphoblastic or '''[[lymphocytic leukemia]]s''', the cancerous change takes place in a type of marrow cell that normally goes on to form [[lymphocyte]]s, which are infection-fighting immune system cells. Most lymphocytic leukemias involve a specific subtype of lymphocyte, the [[B&nbsp;cell]].
* In myeloid or '''[[myelogenous leukemia]]s''', the cancerous change takes place in a [[myeloid cells|type of marrow cell]] that normally goes on to form [[red blood cells]], some other types of white cells, and [[platelets]].

Combining these two classifications provides a total of four main categories. Within each of these four main categories, there are typically several subcategories. Finally, some rarer types are usually considered to be outside of this classification scheme.

* '''Acute lymphoblastic leukemia''' (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in young children. This disease also affects adults, especially those age 65 and older. Standard treatments involve [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiotherapy]]. The survival rates vary by age: 85% in children and 50% in adults.<ref name="isbn0-07-140235-7">{{cite book

* '''[[Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma|Adult T-cell leukemia]]''' is caused by [[human T-lymphotropic virus]] (HTLV), a virus similar to [[human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]]. Like HIV, HTLV infects CD4+ T-cells and replicates within them; however, unlike HIV, it does not destroy them. Instead, HTLV "immortalizes" the infected T-cells, giving them the ability to proliferate abnormally.  Human T cell lymphotropic virus types I and II (HTLV-I/II) are endemic in certain areas of the world.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Symptoms of leukemia.png|thumb|Common symptoms of chronic or acute leukemia<ref>Reference list is found at [[Commons:File:Symptoms of leukemia.png#List|image description page in Wikimedia Commons]]</ref>]]

Damage to the bone marrow, by way of displacing the normal bone marrow cells with higher numbers of immature white blood cells, results in a lack of blood [[platelet]]s, which are important in the [[Coagulation of human blood|blood clotting]] process. This means people with leukemia may easily become [[purpura|bruised]], [[hemorrhage|bleed]] excessively, or develop pinprick bleeds ([[petechia]]e).

[[White blood cell]]s, which are involved in fighting [[pathogen]]s, may be suppressed or dysfunctional. This could cause the patient's immune system to be unable to fight off a simple infection or to start attacking other body cells. Because leukemia prevents the immune system from working normally, some patients experience frequent [[infection]], ranging from infected [[tonsils]], [[oral ulcer|sores in the mouth]], or [[diarrhea]] to life-threatening [[pneumonia]] or [[opportunistic infections]].

Finally, the red blood cell deficiency leads to [[anemia]], which may cause [[dyspnea]] and [[wikt:pallor|pallor]].

Some patients experience other symptoms, such as [[malaise|feeling sick]], having fevers, chills, night sweats, feeling [[fatigue (medical)|fatigued]] and other [[flu-like symptoms]]. Some patients experience nausea or a feeling of fullness due to an enlarged [[liver]] and [[spleen]]; this can result in unintentional [[Weight loss#Intentional weight loss|weight loss]]. [[Precursor cell|Blasts]] affected by the disease may come together and become swollen  in the liver or in the [[lymph nodes]] causing pain and leading to nausea.<ref>{{cite web|title=Leukemia|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=4&hid=113&sid=3db24ea4-7094-4d8a-be87-b76d351e6932%40sessionmgr13&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=mih&AN=39018085|publisher=Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition|accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref>

If the leukemic cells invade the [[central nervous system]], then neurological symptoms (notably [[headache]]s) can occur. All symptoms associated with leukemia can be attributed to other diseases. Consequently, leukemia is always diagnosed through [[medical test]]s.

The word ''leukemia'', which means 'white blood', is derived from the disease's namesake high white blood cell counts that most leukemia patients have before treatment. The high number of white blood cells are apparent when a blood sample is viewed under a microscope. Frequently, these extra white blood cells are immature or dysfunctional. The excessive number of cells can also interfere with the level of other cells, causing a harmful imbalance in the blood count.

Some leukemia patients do not have high white blood cell counts visible during a regular blood count. This less-common condition is called ''aleukemia''. The bone marrow still contains cancerous white blood cells which disrupt the normal production of blood cells, but they remain in the marrow instead of entering the bloodstream, where they would be visible in a blood test. For an aleukemic patient, the white blood cell counts in the bloodstream can be normal or low. Aleukemia can occur in any of the four major types of leukemia, and is particularly common in [[hairy cell leukemia]].<ref name=ACS1/>

==Causes==
There is no single known cause for any of the different types of leukemia. The few known causes, which are not generally factors within the control of the average person, account for relatively few cases.<ref name="pmid12163333">{{cite journal

Leukemia, like other cancers, results from [[somatic mutation|mutations]] in the [[DNA]]. Certain mutations can trigger leukemia by activating [[oncogene]]s or deactivating [[tumor suppressor gene]]s, and thereby disrupting the regulation of cell death, differentiation or division. These mutations may occur spontaneously or as a result of exposure to [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] or [[carcinogen]]ic substances.<ref>{{cite web|first=ACS|title=Do We Know What Causes Leukemia|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_2X_Do_we_know_what_causes_leukemia_62.asp|work=Detailed Guide: Leukemia|publisher=American Cancer Society|accessdate=18 May 2010|year=2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Among adults, the known causes are natural and artificial [[ionizing radiation]], a few [[virus]]es such as [[human T-lymphotropic virus]], and some chemicals, notably [[benzene]] and alkylating [[chemotherapy]] agents for previous malignancies.<ref name="isbn1-55009-111-5">{{cite book

Diet has very limited or no effect, although eating more vegetables may confer a small protective benefit.<ref name="pmid12163333" />

Viruses have also been linked to some forms of leukemia.  Experiments on mice and other mammals have demonstrated the relevance of [[retroviruses]] in leukemia, and human retroviruses have also been identified.  The first human retrovirus identified was [[human T-lymphotropic virus]], or HTLV-1,  which is known to cause [[adult T-cell leukemia]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Barry|title=Leukemia: A Research Report|year=1998|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=0-7881-7189-5|page=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=VfFCVvX9btYC&pg=PA7 7]|url=http://books.google.com/?id=VfFCVvX9btYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=leukemia&q}}</ref>

Some people have a genetic predisposition towards developing leukemia. This predisposition is demonstrated by family histories and [[Twin study|twin studies]].<ref name="isbn1-55009-111-5" /> The affected people may have a single gene or multiple genes in common. In some cases, families tend to develop the same kinds of leukemia as other members; in other families, affected people may develop different forms of [[hematological malignancies|leukemia or related blood cancers]].<ref name="isbn1-55009-111-5" />

In addition to these genetic issues, people with chromosomal abnormalities or certain other genetic conditions have a greater risk of leukemia.<ref name="isbn1-893441-36-9" /> For example, people with [[Down syndrome]] have a significantly increased risk of developing forms of acute leukemia (especially [[acute myeloid leukemia]]), and [[Fanconi anemia]] is a risk factor for developing [[acute myeloid leukemia]].<ref name="isbn1-55009-111-5" />

Whether non-ionizing radiation causes leukemia has been studied for several decades. The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] expert working group undertook a detailed review of all data on static and extremely low frequency electromagnetic energy, which occurs naturally and in association with the generation, transmission, and use of electrical power.<ref name="isbn92-832-1280-0">{{cite book

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is usually based on repeated [[complete blood count]]s and a [[bone marrow examination]] following observations of the symptoms, however, in rare cases blood tests may not show if a patient has leukemia, usually this is because the leukemia is in the early stages or has entered remission. A lymph node biopsy can be performed as well in order to diagnose certain types of leukemia in certain situations.

Following diagnosis, blood chemistry tests can be used to determine the degree of liver and kidney damage or the effects of chemotherapy on the patient.  When concerns arise about visible damage due to leukemia, doctors may use an [[Radiography|X-ray]], [[MRI]], or [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]].  These can potentially view leukemia's effects on such body parts as bones (X-ray), the brain (MRI), or the kidneys, spleen, and liver (ultrasound).  Finally, [[CT scans]] are rarely used to check lymph nodes in the chest.

Despite the use of these methods to diagnose whether or not a patient has leukemia, many people have not been diagnosed because many of the symptoms are vague, unspecific, and can refer to other diseases.  For this reason, the American Cancer Society predicts that at least one-fifth of the people with leukemia have not yet been diagnosed.<ref name=ACS1>{{cite web |url= http://www.cancer.org/docroot/cri/content/cri_2_4_3x_how_is_leukemia_diagnosed_62.asp|title= How is Leukemia Diagnosed?|author= American Cancer Society|year=2010|work= Detailed Guide: Leukemia - Adult Chronic|publisher=American Cancer Society|accessdate=4 May 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

SPRED1 disorder and predisposition to leukemia in children. Blood 2009; 114:1131.]</ref> SPRED1 gene mutations can be diagnosed with genetic sequencing.

==Treatment==
Most forms of leukemia are treated with pharmaceutical [[medication]], typically combined into a multi-drug [[chemotherapy regimen]]. Some are also treated with [[radiation therapy]]. In some cases, a [[bone marrow transplant]] is useful.

===Acute lymphoblastic===
{{Further|Acute lymphoblastic leukemia#Treatment}}
Management of ALL focuses on control of bone marrow and systemic (whole-body) disease. Additionally, treatment must prevent leukemic cells from spreading to other sites, particularly the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) e.g. monthly lumbar punctures. In general, ALL treatment is divided into several phases:
* ''Induction chemotherapy'' to bring about bone marrow remission. For adults, standard induction plans include [[prednisone]], [[vincristine]], and an [[anthracycline]] drug; other drug plans may include [[L-asparaginase]] or [[cyclophosphamide]]. For children with low-risk ALL, standard therapy usually consists of three drugs (prednisone, L-asparaginase, and vincristine) for the first month of treatment.
* ''Consolidation therapy'' or ''intensification therapy'' to eliminate any remaining leukemia cells. There are many different approaches to consolidation, but it is typically a high-dose, multi-drug treatment that is undertaken for a few months. Patients with low- to average-risk ALL receive therapy with [[antimetabolite]] drugs such as [[methotrexate]] and [[6-mercaptopurine]] (6-MP). High-risk patients receive higher drug doses of these drugs, plus additional drugs.
* ''CNS prophylaxis'' (preventive therapy) to stop the cancer from spreading to the brain and nervous system in high-risk patients. Standard [[prophylaxis]] may include radiation of the head and/or drugs delivered directly into the spine.
* ''Maintenance treatments'' with chemotherapeutic drugs to prevent disease recurrence once remission has been achieved. Maintenance therapy usually involves lower drug doses, and may continue for up to three years.
* Alternatively, ''[[allogeneic bone marrow transplantation]]'' may be appropriate for high-risk or relapsed patients.<ref>Hoffbrand AV, Moss PAH, and Pettit JE, "Essential Haematology", Blackwell, 5th ed., 2006.</ref>

===Chronic lymphocytic===
{{Further|Chronic lymphocytic leukemia#Treatment}}

==== Decision to treat ====
[[Hematologist]]s base CLL treatment on both the stage and symptoms of the individual patient. A large group of CLL patients have low-grade disease, which does not benefit from treatment. Individuals with CLL-related complications or more advanced disease often benefit from treatment. In general, the indications for treatment are:
* Falling [[hemoglobin]] or [[platelet]] count
* Progression to a later stage of disease
* Painful, disease-related overgrowth of [[lymph node]]s or [[spleen]]
* An increase in the rate of [[lymphocyte]] production <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/CLL/HealthProfessional/page2 |title=Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (PDQ) Treatment: Stage Information |author=National Cancer Institute |accessdate=2007-09-04 |work=}}</ref>

==== Typical treatment approach ====
CLL is probably incurable by present treatments. The primary chemotherapeutic plan is [[polytherapy|combination]] chemotherapy with [[chlorambucil]] or [[cyclophosphamide]], plus a [[corticosteroid]] such as [[prednisone]] or [[prednisolone]]. The use of a corticosteroid has the additional benefit of suppressing some related autoimmune diseases, such as [[Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia|immunohemolytic anemia]] or [[Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura|immune-mediated thrombocytopenia]].

===Acute myelogenous===
{{Further|Acute myeloid leukemia#Treatment}}

Many different anti-cancer drugs are effective for the treatment of AML. Treatments vary somewhat according to the age of the patient and according to the specific subtype of AML. Overall, the strategy is to control bone marrow and systemic (whole-body) disease, while offering specific treatment for the central nervous system (CNS), if involved.

In general, most oncologists rely on combinations of drugs for the initial, ''induction phase'' of chemotherapy. Such combination chemotherapy usually offers the benefits of early [[remission (medicine)|remission]] and a lower risk of disease resistance. ''Consolidation'' and ''maintenance'' treatments are intended to prevent disease recurrence. Consolidation treatment often entails a repetition of induction chemotherapy or the intensification chemotherapy with additional drugs. By contrast, maintenance treatment involves drug doses that are lower than those administered during the induction phase.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cancer.org/cancer/leukemia-acutemyeloidaml/detailedguide/leukemia-acute-myeloid-myelogenous-treating-typical-treatment-of-aml|title=Typical treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (except promyelocytic M3) |author=American Cancer Society|date=22 March 2012|work=  Detailed Guide: Leukemia - Acute Myeloid (AML)|publisher= American Cancer Society|accessdate=31 Oct 2012}}</ref>

With this drug, more than 90% of patients will be able to keep the disease in check for at least five years,<ref name="pmid17970609"/> so that CML becomes a chronic, manageable condition.

In a more advanced, uncontrolled state, when the patient cannot tolerate imatinib, or if the patient wishes to attempt a permanent cure, then an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may be performed. This procedure involves high-dose chemotherapy and radiation followed by infusion of bone marrow from a compatible donor. Approximately 30% of patients die from this procedure.<ref name="pmid17970609"/>

===Hairy cell===
{{Further|Hairy cell leukemia#Treatment}}

'''Decision to treat'''<br>
Patients with hairy cell leukemia who are symptom-free typically do not receive immediate treatment. Treatment is generally considered necessary when the patient shows signs and symptoms such as low blood cell counts (e.g., infection-fighting neutrophil count below 1.0&nbsp;K/µL), frequent infections, unexplained bruises, anemia, or fatigue that is significant enough to disrupt the patient's everyday life.

'''Typical treatment approach'''<br>
Patients who need treatment usually receive either one week of [[cladribine]], given daily by intravenous infusion or a simple injection under the skin, or six months of [[pentostatin]], given every four weeks by intravenous infusion. In most cases, one round of treatment will produce a prolonged remission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/abstract/bloodjournal;109/9/3672 |title=Cladribine in a weekly versus daily schedule for untreated active hairy cell leukemia: final report from the Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG) of a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial -- Robak et al. 109 (9): 3672 -- Blood |accessdate=2007-09-10 |work=}}</ref>

Other treatments include [[rituximab]] infusion or self-injection with [[Interferon-alpha]]. In limited cases, the patient may benefit from ''[[splenectomy]]'' (removal of the spleen). These treatments are not typically given as the first treatment because their success rates are lower than cladribine or pentostatin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/93/8/2471 |title=Filgrastim for Cladribine-Induced Neutropenic Fever in Patients With Hairy Cell Leukemia -- Saven et al. 93 (8): 2471 -- Blood |accessdate=2007-09-10 |work=}}</ref>

===T-cell prolymphocytic===

T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is difficult to treat, and it does not respond to most available chemotherapeutic drugs.<ref name="pmid11535503" /> Many different treatments have been attempted, with limited success in certain patients: [[purine analogues]] (pentostatin, fludarabine, cladribine), [[chlorambucil]], and various forms of combination chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone [[CHOP]], cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone [COP], vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisone, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin [[VAPEC-B]]). [[Alemtuzumab]] (Campath), a [[monoclonal antibody]] that attacks white blood cells, has been used in treatment with greater success than previous options.<ref name="pmid11535503" />

Some patients who successfully respond to treatment also undergo [[stem cell transplantation]] to consolidate the response.<ref name="pmid11535503" />

Among children with some form of cancer, about a third have a type of leukemia, most commonly [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]].<ref name=LLS /> A type of leukemia is the second most common form of cancer in infants (under the age of 12 months) and the most common form of cancer in older children.<ref name="SEER1999">James G.

[[Race (human classification)|Race]] is [[risk factor]].  [[Hispanic]]s, especially those under the age of 20, are at the highest risk for leukemia, while [[White people|whites]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and [[Alaska Natives]] are at higher risk than [[Black people|blacks]].<ref>[http://www.lls.org/diseaseinformation/getinformationsupport/factsstatistics/childhoodbloodcancers/ Childhood Blood Cancers | The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==History==
[[File:Rudolf Virchow.jpg|thumb|130px|Rudolf Virchow]]
Leukemia was first observed by pathologist [[Rudolf Virchow]] in 1845.  Observing an abnormally large number of white blood cells in a blood sample from a patient, Virchow called the condition ''Leukämie'' in [[German (language)|German]], which he formed from the two [[Greek (language)|Greek]] words ''leukos'' ([[wikt:λευκός|λευκός]]), meaning "white", and ''aima'' ([[wikt:αίμα|αίμα]]), meaning "blood".  Around ten years after Virchow's findings, pathologist [[Franz Ernst Christian Neumann]] found that one deceased leukemia patient's bone marrow was colored "dirty green-yellow" as opposed to the normal red.  This finding allowed Neumann to conclude that a bone marrow problem was responsible for the abnormal blood of leukemia patients.

By 1900 leukemia was viewed as a family of diseases as opposed to a single disease.  By 1947 Boston pathologist [[Sidney Farber]] believed from past experiments that [[aminopterin]], a folic acid mimic, could potentially cure leukemia in children.  The majority of the children with ALL who were tested showed signs of improvement in their bone marrow, but none of them were actually cured.  This, however, led to further experiments.

In 1962, researchers Emil J. Freireich Jr. and Emil Frei III used combination chemotherapy to attempt to cure leukemia.  The tests were successful with some patients surviving long after the tests.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patlak|first=Margie|title=Targeting Leukemia: From Bench to Bedside|url=http://opa1.faseb.org/pdf/leukemia.pdf|work=Breakthroughs in Bioscience|publisher=The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology|accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref>

==Society and culture==
Leukemias are often romanticized in 20th century fiction. It is portrayed as a joy-ending, clean disease whose fair, innocent and gentle victims die young or at the wrong time.  As such, it is the cultural successor to [[Tuberculosis#Folklore|tuberculosis]], which held this cultural position until tuberculosis was discovered to be an infectious disease.<ref>{{cite book

|pages=18
|isbn=0-374-17443-1 
|oclc= }}</ref>  The 1970 romance novel [[Love Story (novel)|''Love Story'']] is an example of this romanticization of leukemia.

==Research directions==
Significant research into the causes, prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of leukemia is being performed. Hundreds of [[clinical trials]]are being planned or conducted at any given time.<ref>[http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=leukemia Search of: leukemia - List Results -ClinicalTrials.gov<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Studies may focus on effective means of treatment, better ways of treating the disease, improving the quality of life for patients, or appropriate care in remission or after cures.

In general, there are two types of leukemia research: clinical or [[translational research]] and [[basic research]]. Clinical/translational research focuses on studying the disease in a defined and generally immediately patient-applicable way, such as testing a new drug in patients.  By contrast, basic science research studies the disease process at a distance, such as seeing whether a suspected carcinogen can cause leukemic changes in isolated cells in the laboratory or how the DNA changes inside leukemia cells as the disease progresses.  The results from basic research studies are generally less immediately useful to patients with the disease.<ref>{{cite web|first=The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society|title=Understanding Clinical Trials for Blood Cancers|url=http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/attachments/National/br_1162487596.pdf|publisher=Leukemia and Lymphoma Society|accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref>

Treatment through [[gene therapy]] is currently being pursued.  One such approach turns [[T cell]]s into cancer-targeting attackers. As of August 2011, a year after treatment, two of the three patients are cancer-free.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jaslow|first=Ryan|title=New Leukemia Therapy Destroys Cancer by Turning Blood Cells into "Assassins"|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-20091135-10391704.html|publisher=CBSnews.com HealthPop section|accessdate=11 August 2011}}</ref><ref>Coghlan, Andy (26 March 2013)[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21729104.100-gene-therapy-cures-leukaemia-in-eight-days.html Gene therapy cures leukaemia in eight days] The New Scientist, Retrieved 15 April 2013</ref>

Leukemia is rarely associated with pregnancy, affecting only about 1 in 10,000 pregnant women.<ref name=Shapira />  How it is handled depends primarily on the type of leukemia.  Nearly all leukemias appearing in pregnant women are acute leukemias.<ref name=Koren>{{cite journal
