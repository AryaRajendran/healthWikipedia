'''Michael Hermanussen''' (born 26 April 1955 in [[Hamburg]]) is a German [[pediatrician]] and [[professor]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uni-kiel.de/aktuell/pm/2004/2004-013-pers-januar.shtml|title=new staff at CAU, 2004|date=2009-01-08|language=german}}</ref> at the [[University of Kiel]]. He is known for his work on growth and [[nutrition]].

==Life==
Hermanussen studied [[medicine]] and worked as a pediatrician at the University of Kiel from 1982 until 1989. He investigated [[Human development (biology)|growth]] and [[child]] development ([[auxology]]) and first described mini growth spurts.<ref>Hermanussen M, Geiger-Benoit K, Burmeister J, Sippell WG (1988) Periodical changes of short term growth velocity ("mini growth spurts") in human growth. Ann Hum Biol 15:103-109</ref> Since 1990 he cooperates in international joint projects with scientists and also works in a general pediatric office. He organizes national and international meetings on growth and nutrition. Since 2003 he is a member of the scientific board of the German society for [[Anthropology]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gfanet.de/en/home|title=website of "Gesellschaft für Anthropologie"|date=2009-01-07}}</ref> and chief editor of ”Anthropologischer Anzeiger”.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.schweizerbart.de/journals/anthranz|title=website of "Anthropologischer Anzeiger"|date=2009-01-07}}</ref> He is the founder and head of the German society for auxology.

==Scientific Work==
Hermanussen developed new mathematical methods for improved diagnostics of growth disorders<ref>Hermanussen M, Largo RH, Molinari L (2001) Canalisation in human growth: a widely accepted concept reconsidered. Eur J Pediatr 160:163-7</ref><ref>Hermanussen M, Meigen C (2007) Phase variation in child and adolescent growth. Int J Biostatistics 3:1-16</ref> and a new technique for estimating final [[Human height|adult height]].<ref>Hermanussen M, Cole TJ (2003) The calculation of target height reconsidered. Horm Res 59:180-3</ref>
He developed mini-[[knemometry]], a new and accurate technique for growth [[measurement]]s in children. This device determines the [[lower leg]] length at an [[accuracy]] that growth becomes measurable within a few days.<ref>Hermanussen M (1988) Knemometry, a new tool for the investigation of growth. Eur J Pediatr 147:350-355</ref><ref>Hermanussen M, Geiger-Benoit K, Burmeister J, Sippell WG (1988) Periodical changes of short term growth velocity ("mini growth spurts") in human growth. Ann Hum Biol 15:103-109</ref><ref>Hermanussen M, Seele K (1997) Mini-Knemometry: An accurate technique for lower leg length measurements in early childhood. Ann Hum Biol 24:307-313</ref><ref>Hermanussen M (2003) The measurement of short term growth. J Pediatr Endocrinol Metabol 16:969-971</ref> In addition he developed a similar [[technology]] for measuring growth in [[rats]] within intervals of a few hours. This technology was important for the better understanding of the effects of [[growth hormone]].<ref>Hermanussen M, Rol del Lama M, Burmeister J, Fernandez-Tresguerres JA (1995). Mikro-knemometry: An accurate technique of growth measurement in rats. Physiol Behavior 58:347-352</ref><ref>Hermanussen M, Rol de Lama M, Tresguerres JAF, Grasedyck L, Burmeister J (1998) Short term growth: evidence for chaotic series of mini growth spurts in rat growth. Physiol Behav 64:7-13</ref> His investigations resulted in a significant improvement of [[Growth hormone treatment|growth hormone therapies]].<ref>Hermanussen M, Geiger-Benoit, K, Sippell WG (1985) Catch-up growth following transfer from three times weekly im to daily sc administration of hGH in GH deficient patients, monitored by knemometry. Acta Endocrinol 109:163-168</ref><ref>Hermanussen M, Geiger-Benoit K, Burmeister J, Sippell WG (1987) Can the knemometer shorten the time for growth rate assessment? Acta Paediatr Scand Suppl 337:30-36</ref> For the first time, Hermanussen showed that [[anorexia nervosa]] patients do not only stop growing they even can shrink.<ref>Hermanussen M, Geiger-Benoit, K, Sippell WG (1987) "Negative growth" in anorexia nervosa assessed by knemometry. Eur J Pediatr 146:561-564</ref>

Since 2002 he works in [[nutrition]] and [[obesity]], with particular respect to [[monosodium glutamate]] on [[appetite]] regulation.<ref>Hermanussen M. et al.: Obesity, voracity and short stature: the impact of glutamate on the regulation of appetite. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition. 2006; 60:25-31</ref><ref>Hermanussen M (2008) No consensus on glutamate. Eur J Clin Nutr 62:1252-3</ref> During this project Hermanussen showed for the first time that [[convenience food]] contains [[neurotransmitters]].<ref>Hermanussen M, Gonder U, Jakobs C, Stegemann D, Hoffmann G. Patterns of free amino acids in German convenience food products: marked mismatch between label information and composition. Eur J Clin Nutr 23 September 2009 [Epub ahead of print]</ref>
