'''Ugo Cerletti''' (26 September 1877 - 25 July 1963) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[neurology|neurologist]] who discovered the method of [[electroconvulsive therapy]] in [[psychiatry]]. Electroconvulsive therapy is a therapy used, in which a seizure is provoked for a short amount of time by the use of electrical currents. This therapy is used to treat mental disorders by altering the chemical processes that occur in the brain. By doing so, the symptoms experienced by the patient before the procedure, will no longer be experienced by the patient after undergoing the procedure. This method is useful when other possible treatments do not cure the person of their mental disorder.<ref>{{cite web|title=Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/electroconvulsive-therapy/MY00129|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research|accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref>

==Life==

He was born in [[Conegliano]], in the region of [[Veneto]], [[Italy]], on 26 September 1877. He studied [[Medicine]] at [[Rome]] and [[Turin]], later specializing in [[neurology]] and [[neuropsychiatry]]. In his early scientific studies, Cerletti mainly focused on common issues in the fields of histology and histopathology. He demonstrated how the nervous tissue reacts to different pathogenic stimuli in its own ways, making the histopathology of nervous tissue an independent category in the study of medicine.<ref>Ugo Cerletti. American Journal of Psychiatry. 1999 Apr;156(4):630.</ref> As a student, he conducted some research under several influential people studying in the Medicinal field at that time.<ref>Ugo Cerletti. American Journal of Psychiatry. 1999 Apr;156(4):630.</ref>  He studied with the most eminent neurologists of his time, first in [[Paris]], [[France]], with [[Pierre Marie]] and Dupré, then in [[Munich]], [[Germany]], with [[Emil Kraepelin]] (the "father" of modern scientific [[psychiatry]]) and [[Alois Alzheimer]] (the discoverer of the most common form of [[Alzheimer's disease|senile dementia]], which today bears his name); and in [[Heidelberg]], with [[Franz Nissl]], a neuropathologist. Other large names in medicine that he studied with at the time include Sciamanna and Nissl.<ref>Ugo Cerletti 1877-1963. (1999). The American Journal of Psychiatry, 156(4), 630.</ref> 

After his studies, he was appointed head of the Neurobiological Institute, at the Mental Institute of [[Milan]]. He remained the director of the Neurobiological Institute of the Psychiatric Hospital of Milan from 1919 to 1924.<ref>Ugo Cerletti 1877–1963. American Journal of Psychiatry. 1999 Apr;156(4):630-630.</ref> In 1924 he was given a lecturing post in Neuropsychiatry in [[Bari]]; then, in 1928, he took over the post of Prof. [[Enrico Morselli]], at the [[University of Genoa]]. Finally, in 1935, he became the Chair of the Department of Mental and Neurological Diseases at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]], where he developed [[electroconvulsive therapy]] for the treatment of several kinds of [[mental disorder]]s, a discovery which made him world-famous. Ugo Cerletti was appointed Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and Neurology at the University of Rome La Sapienza.<ref>Kalinowsky, L. (1964). Ugo Cerletti, 1877-1963. Comprehensive Psychiatry, 5(1), 64-65.</ref>

==Works and Discovery==

Cerletti came to the first use of electroshock for therapeutic purposes in human beings by way of his experiments with animals on the neuropathological consequences of repeated [[epilepsy]] attacks. In Genoa, and later in Rome, he used an electroshock apparatus to provoke repeatable, reliable [[epilepsy|epileptic]] fits in dogs and other animals. There we many casualties with these experiments on the animals, many of the organisms died.<ref>http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dh38el.html</ref>

The idea to use [[ECT]] in humans came first to him by watching [[pig]]s being [[anesthesia|anesthetised]] with electroshock before being butchered, in Rome. The story goes on his way home, he stopped at a butcher shop. The shop didn't have the cut he wanted, and was told to walk back to the slaughter house behind the shop to have the cut made for him. At that slaughter house, the technique used for butchering cattle was to shock their heads. The cattle would go into seizures and fall down. This made it easy to slit their throats, as the cattle couldn't resist or fight back. He reasoned that ECT might be useful, particularly for schizophrenia; in his time period, people believed that seizures were essential in preventing schizophrenia, since many found that those diagnosed with epilepsy were immune to the disorder. The reasoning was incorrect, but his findings were monumental, and EST therapies continue to be used to treat depression today. 

Furthermore, since 1935, [[metrazol]], an [[epilepsy|epileptogenic]] drug, and [[insulin]], a hormone, were in wide use in many countries to treat [[schizophrenia|schizophrenics]], with great success. This approach was based on Nobel winner [[Julius Wagner-Jauregg]]'s research on the use of [[malaria]]-induced convulsions to treat some nervous and mental disorders, such as the [[general paresis of the insane]], caused by neural [[syphilis]], as well as on [[Ladislas J. Meduna]]'s theory that schizophrenia and epilepsy were antagonistic. The pharmacological convulsive treatment of [[Ladislas J. Meduna]] was replaced by the much cleaner and less cumbersome electrical method of Cerletti.<ref>KaIinowsky, L. B.(1964). Ugo Cerletti, 1877–1963: Comprehensive Psychiatry , 5 (1), pg. 64-65 [http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/tmp/2160359160779657064.pdf]</ref> In the same period, this also led to instituting insulin-coma therapy in psychiatry, by [[Manfred Sakel]], in 1933. 

Cerletti first used ECT in a human patient, a diagnosed schizophrenic with [[delusion]]s, [[hallucination]]s and confusion, in April 1938, in collaboration with [[Lucio Bini]]. A series of electroshocks were able to return the patient to a normal state of mind. This experiment proved electric shock treatment to cure human patients diagnosed with specific diseases. Electric shock treatment quickly replaced insulin and Metrazol as the favourite form of shock treatment, and became the most effective method of controlling troublesome asylum inmates.<ref>http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/511.html</ref> Thereafter, in the succeeding years, Cerletti and his coworkers experimented with thousands of electroshocks in hundreds of animals and patients, and were able to determine its usefulness and safety in clinical practice, with several indications, such as in acute schizophrenia, [[manic-depressive illness]], major [[clinical depression|depression]] episodes, etc. His work was very influential, and ECT quickly spread out as a therapeutic procedure all over the world. Despite the fact that it does evoke a grand mal seizure marked by a stereotyped succession of events. EC work done later was deemed to be a safe and highly effective treatment, particularly for mood disorders.<ref>http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?Volume=156&page=630&journalID=13</ref> With this, Cerletti was noted to be the first person to deliver a stress treatment in which the patient did not suffer any discomfort.<ref>Ugo Cerletti 1877-1963. The British Journal of Psychiatry (1964) 110: 599-600 doi: 10.1192/bjp.110.467.599</ref> A tetanic muscular contraction, the "electric spasm,'' is followed after a latency of seconds by unconsciousness, a high voltage paroxysmal spike and sharp-wave discharge, and a clonic convulsion. Upon recovery of consciousness the subject is left with a transient acute brain syndrome. Acute brain syndrome can be defined as "A sudden state of severe confusion and rapid changes in brain function, sometimes associated with hallucinations and hyperactivity, in which the patient is inaccessible to normal contact. Symptoms may include inability to concentrate and disorganized thinking evidenced by rambling, irrelevant, or incoherent speech. There may be a reduced level of consciousness, sensory misperceptions and illusions, disturbances of sleep, drowsiness, disorientation to time, place, or person, and problems with memory," which is to be expected in people who suffer head injury, and contributes to the 'need' for compulsion to treatment under law, as people are unwilling to volunteer to such barbarism .

As a result of his experiments, which took him from the psychiatric hospital to the abbatoir and the zoologic gardens, Cerletti developed a theory that ECT caused the brain to produce vitalising substances, which he called "agro-agonines" (from the Greek for extreme struggle). He put his theory into practice by injecting patients with a suspension of electroshocked pig brain, with encouraging results. Although electroshocked pig brain therapy was used by a few psychiatrists in Italy, France and Brazil it did not become as popular as ECT, which soon replaced metrazol therapy all over the world because it was cheaper, less frightening and more convenient.<ref>Cerletti, U (1956). "Electroshock therapy". In AM Sackler ''et al.'' (eds) ''The Great Physiodynamic Therapies in Psychiatry: an historical appraisal.'' New York: Hoeber-Harper, 91-120.</ref> Cerletti and Bini were nominated for a [[Nobel Prize]] for Physiology or Medicine for their work on the treatment in the 1930s.

Today, ECT is most often recommended for use as a treatment for severe depression that has not responded to other treatment, and is also used in the treatment of mania and catatonia.

==Legacy==

In his long activity as a psychiatrist and neurologist, Cerletti published 113 original papers, about the pathology of [[senile plaques]] in [[Alzheimer's disease]], on the structure of [[neuroglia]], the [[blood–brain barrier]], [[syphilis]], etc. In 1950 he received an [[honorary degree]] by the [[Collège de Sorbonne]] at the [[University of Paris]], in addition to a long list of other awards and degrees.

Away from his medical work, Cerletti is credited with introducing the idea of white uniforms for alpine troops in order to reduce visibility during the First World War. He also invented artillery missiles with delayed-action fuses. These were used by the Italian and French armies in order to create mine fields between enemy positions.<ref>Kalinowsky LB. 1964. Ugo cerletti, 1877-1963. Compr Psychiatry 5(1):64-5.</ref>

Cerletti died in Rome on 25 July 1963.
