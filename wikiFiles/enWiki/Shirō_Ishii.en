{{nihongo|'''Shirō Ishii'''|石井 四郎|Ishii Shirō|extra= June 25, 1892&nbsp;– October 9, 1959}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[microbiologist]] and the [[lieutenant general]] of [[Unit 731]], a [[biological warfare]] unit of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] involved in [[human experimentation]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945).

==Biography==
===Early years===
Ishii was born in the former [[Shibayama, Chiba|Shibayama Village]] of [[Sanbu District, Chiba|Sanbu District]] in [[Chiba Prefecture]], and studied [[medicine]] at [[Kyoto Imperial University]]. He was commissioned into the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in 1921 as an army surgeon, second class (surgeon lieutenant). In 1922 was assigned to the 1st Army Hospital and Army Medical School in [[Tokyo]]. There his work impressed his superiors enough to gain him, two years later, post-graduate medical schooling back at the [[Kyoto University|Kyoto Imperial University]].

In 1925, Ishii was promoted to army surgeon, first class (surgeon captain). Beginning in 1928, he took a two-year tour of the West. In his travels, he did extensive research on the effects of [[biological warfare]] and [[chemical warfare]] developments from [[World War I]] onwards.  It was a highly successful mission and helped win him the patronage of [[Sadao Araki]], [[Minister of War of Japan|Minister of the Army]]. He received promotion to senior army surgeon, third class (surgeon major), in January 1931.

===Biological warfare project===
In 1932, he began his preliminary experiments in biological warfare as a secret project for the Japanese military at [[Zhongma Fortress]]. He was promoted to senior army surgeon, second class (surgeon lieutenant-colonel) in 1935. In 1936, [[Unit 731]] was formed. Ishii built a huge compound–more than 150 buildings over six square kilometers–outside the city of [[Harbin]], [[China]].  The research was secret, and the cover story was that Unit 731 was engaged in [[water purification|water-purification]] work.

Ishii was promoted to senior army surgeon, first class (surgeon colonel) in 1938. On 9 February 1939, he gave a lecture on [[bacteriological warfare]] in the War Ministry Grand Conference Hall in Tokyo. One of the attendees was prince [[Prince Chichibu|Yasuhito Chichibu]],<ref name="Harris 2002 p142" /> Hirohito's (the 124th [[Emperor of Japan]]) brother, who also watched vivisection demonstrations by Ishii.<ref name="Harris 2003 v2 p469" />  From 1940, Ishii was appointed Chief of the Biological Warfare Section of the [[Kwantung Army]], holding the post simultaneously with that of the Bacteriological Department of the Army Medical Academy,<ref name="Ammenthorp" /> and was promoted to surgeon major-general in March of the following year.  In 1942, Ishii began field tests of germ warfare agents developed, and various methods of dispersion (e.g. via firearms, bombs etc.) both on [[China|Chinese]] [[prisoners of war]] and operationally on battlefields and against [[civilian]]s in Chinese cities. Some historians{{citation needed|date=November 2007}} estimate that tens of thousands died as a result of the bio-weapons (including [[bubonic plague]], [[cholera]], [[anthrax]] and others) deployed. His unit also conducted physiological experiments on human subjects, including [[vivisection]]s, forced [[abortion]]s, and simulated [[stroke]]s, [[heart attack]]s, [[frostbite]] and [[hypothermia]].

From 1942–1945, Ishii was Chief of the Medical Section of the [[Japanese First Army]].<ref name="Ammenthorp" />  He was promoted to surgeon lieutenant-general in March 1945. In the final days of the [[Pacific War]] and in the face of imminent defeat, Japanese troops blew up the headquarters of Unit 731 in order to destroy evidence of the research done there.  As part of the cover-up, Ishii ordered 150 remaining subjects killed. More than ten thousand people,<ref name="ChinaDaily" /> from which around 600 every year were provided by the ''[[kempeitai]]'' (Japanese secret police),<ref name="Tanaka 1996 p138" /> were subjects of the experimentation conducted by Unit 731. These were called by Ishii and his peers '''''maruta''''' (丸太) "logs," a term originating either in the view of subjects as inert, expendable entities or possibly in the cover story told to locals that the facility contained a sawmill.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Immunity===
Arrested by the [[Occupation of Japan|US occupation authorities]] at the end of [[World War II]], Ishii and other Unit 731 leaders were to be thoroughly interrogated by the [[USSR|Soviet authorities]].<ref name="BBC 29 Oct. 1984" /> Instead Ishii and his team managed to negotiate and receive [[Immunity from prosecution (international law)|immunity]] in 1946 from [[Japanese war crime|war-crime]]s prosecution before the [[Tokyo tribunal]] in exchange for their full disclosure of [[germ warfare]] data based on [[human experimentation]]. Although the Soviet Russian authorities wished the prosecutions to take place, the USA objected after the reports of the investigating US microbiologists. Among these was Dr. Edwin Hill (Chief of [[Fort Detrick]]), whose report stated that the information was "absolutely invaluable", it "could never have been obtained in the USA because of scruples attached to experiments on humans", and "the information was obtained fairly cheaply".<ref name="BBC 29 Oct. 1984" /> On 6 May 1947, [[Douglas MacArthur]] wrote to Washington that "additional data, possibly some statements from Ishii probably can be obtained by informing Japanese involved that information will be retained in intelligence channels and will not be employed as '[[Japanese war crimes|War Crimes]]' evidence."<ref name="Gold 2003 p109" /> The deal was concluded in 1948.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} In this way Ishii was never prosecuted for any [[Japanese war crimes|war crimes]].

Richard Drayton, a [[Cambridge University]] history [[lecturer]], claimed that Ishii later went to [[Maryland]] to advise on [[bioweapon]]s.<ref name="Guardian" /> If Ishii did travel to Maryland, it was most likely to advise at [[Fort Detrick]], a well known major biomedical experimentation facility in [[Frederick, Maryland]]. Another source says he stayed in Japan,<ref name="Japan Times" /> where he  opened a clinic where he did examinations and treatments for free. He was especially concerned with the health of children. In his final years he converted to [[Christianity]].<ref>''[[Asahi Shinbun]]'' June 12, 2007</ref>  He kept a diary but it did not reference any of his wartime activity.<ref>青木冨貴子「731―石井四郎と細菌戦部隊の闇を暴く」新潮社(新潮文庫)、2005年。ISBN 4-10-373205-9</ref> He died of [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]] at the age of 67.<ref name="Daily Mail" />
