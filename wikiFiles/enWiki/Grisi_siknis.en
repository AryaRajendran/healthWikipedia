'''Grisi siknis''' (in [[Miskito language]], from the English, means “crazy sickness”) is a contagious, [[culture-bound syndrome]] that occurs predominantly among the [[Miskito people|Miskito]] People of eastern [[Central America]] and affects mainly young women.<ref name="Dennis 445-505">{{cite journal|last1=Dennis|first1=Philip A.|title=Part three: Grisi Siknis Among the Miskito|journal=Medical Anthropology|volume=5|issue=4|year=1981|pages=445–505|issn=0145-9740|doi=10.1080/01459740.1981.9986998}}</ref> It is also known as “grisi munaia”, “Chipil siknis” and “Nil siknis”. More recently cases occurring amongst people of Spanish descent have also been reported.

== Description ==

According to Dr. Phil Dennis of [[Texas Tech University]], ''grisi siknis'' is typically characterized by longer periods of anxiety, nausea, dizziness, irrational anger and fear, interlaced with short periods of rapid frenzy, in which the victim “lose[s] consciousness, believe[s] that devils beat them and have sexual relations with them” and runs away.<ref name="Dennis 445-505" />

Often the outbreak of the syndrome is violent in nature, with victims grabbing weapons, attacking unseen enemies and/or hurting themselves.<ref name="Dennis 445-505" />

The causes of grisi siknis are indefinite, says the [[American Psychology Association]], but the prevailing Western theory calls this syndrome a “psychological disorder due to stress, upheaval and despair”.<ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2000">{{cite book|author=American Psychiatric Association.

Traditional Miskito belief, says Dennis, holds that grisi siknis is the result of evil spirits or black sorcerers.<ref name="Dennis 445-505" /> While Western medicine typically has no effect on those afflicted with the disease, the remedies of Miskito herbalists or witch doctors are often successful in curing grisi siknis.<ref name="Dennis 445-505" />

==Symptoms==

Symptoms of grisi siknis vary, but there is a distinct set of central characteristics. Most of the victims are young girls from 15 to 18 years old.<ref name="Dennis 445-505" /> The attacks are prefaced by headaches, dizziness, anxiety, nausea, irrational anger and/or fear.<ref name="Dennis 445-505" /> During the attack, the “victim loses consciousness” and falls to the ground, subsequently running away, which running Dennis calls “perhaps the most distinctive defining characteristic of grisi siknis behavior”.<ref name="Dennis 445-505" /> The victim may view other people as devils, feel no pain for bodily injuries and have absolute amnesia regarding their physical circumstances.<ref name="Dennis 445-505" /> Some grab machetes or broken bottles to wave off unseen assailants.<ref name="Dennis 445-505" /> Other victims are reported to have performed superhuman feats,<ref name="Dennis 445-505" /> vomited strange objects such as spiders, hair and coins <ref name="Ross, Nicola 2006">{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=Nicola|year=2006|month=June|title=Nicaragua’s Crazy Sickness|journal=[[The Walrus]]|location=[[Toronto]], [[Canada]]|publisher=Walrus Foundation|url=http://walrusmagazine.com/articles/2006.06-anthropology-nicaragua-grisi-siknis/}}</ref> and spoken in tongues. <ref name="Dennis 445-505" /> In some cases the semi-conscious victim will speak the names of the next to be infected, although it is not always accurate.<ref name="Ross, Nicola 2006"/> It is still highly contagious.<ref name="Dennis 445-505" /> During attacks, victims report mental visions in which devils or evil spirits come for them, and have sex with them.<ref name="Dennis 445-505" /> These visions also include anything from horrifying nightmares to pleasant experiences, and many anthropologists claim these are sexual experiences.  This is a disputed fact, as not all cases involve sexual encounters.<ref name="Dennis 445-505" /> Attacks occur anywhere from multiple times a day to rarely when one is infected with grisi siknis.<ref name="Dennis 445-505" /> A person typically remains with the disease for several months to a year without medical attention, although some cases have been documented to recur for much longer. <ref name="Dennis 445-505" />

== Grisi siknis in relation to culturally bound syndromes ==

Joseph Westermeyer, Head of [[Psychiatry]] at [[Oklahoma University]], states that a culturally bound syndrome is defined as “certain trance-like disturbances [that] occur with unusual frequencies in certain societies”.<ref name="Westermeyer 798-804">{{cite journal|last=Westermeyer|first=Joseph|title=Psychiatric diagnosis across cultural boundaries|journal=[[The American Journal of Psychiatry]]|volume=142|issue=7|pages=798–805|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|year=1985|month=July|pmid=4014501|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=142&page=798}}</ref> These syndromes, he says, actually occur in a wide variety of cultures separated by great distance that have similar symptoms  including “fear, anxiety, amnesia, aimless escape, psychophysiological symptoms, social withdrawal, behavioral deviance and nondirected violence”.<ref name="Westermeyer 798-804" />  However, these symptoms are not confined to culturally bound syndromes, as others, such as “[[personality disorder]], [[neurasthenia]], crisis/judgment disorders, [[organic brain syndrome]]s, [[drug]]-induced [[delirium]], major [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[mania]], [[schizophreniform]] and [[schizophrenia]]” might constitute the true psychiatric diagnosis.”<ref name="Westermeyer 798-804" /> Because of these cross-cultural symptoms, it is argued that these syndromes are not necessarily unique ”.<ref name="Westermeyer 798-804" /> and that applying the term ‘culturally bound’ to them hampers science’s ability to explore them on the same level as other [[psychological problem]]s.<ref name="Ruiz CPH">{{Cite thesis|type=Ph.D.|title=Cultural Politics and Health: the Development of Intercultural Health Policies in the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua|url=http://etd.library.pitt.edu/ETD/available/etd-12062006-174845/unrestricted/Edgardo_Ruiz_ETD2006.pdf|last=Ruiz|first=Edgardo|year=1999|publisher=[[University of Puerto Rico]]}}</ref> Outbreaks of these symptoms are sporadic and epidemic.”<ref name="Westermeyer 798-804" /> Some culturally bound syndromes, in addition to grisi siknis, include:

According to the American Psychiatry Association, pibloktoq, “frenzy” witchcraft, chakore and amok, are all, like grisi siknis, classified as “running” syndromes, in that they contain “sudden high-level activity, [a] trance-like state, potentially dangerous behavior in the form of running [and] exhaustion, sleep [and/or] amnesia”.<ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2000"/> It is generally applied to purposeless roving.<ref name="Mezzich, Juan E 1996"/> 

In addition, Dr. Richard Castillo, as quoted by Dr. C. George Boeree, believes that amok (with very similar symptoms to grisi siknis), pibloktoq, latah, “falling out”, “indisposition”, and the “fits” are all related to impulse control disorders, and thus are associated with [[trichotillomania]], compulsive gambling, pyromania, and kleptomania in Western medicine.<ref name = "Boeree DD" />

== Grisi siknis in relation to Western medicine ==

According to the American Psychiatric Association, a Western medical condition similar in many aspects to culturally bound syndromes, particularly the “running” syndromes, of which grisi siknis is part, is dissociative (or psychogenic) fugue.<ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2000"/> In any fugal state, a person appears normal, but has amnesia or identity forgetfulness.<ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2000"/> Dissociative fugue is distinguished by impulsive travel and amnesia, identity uncertainty, stress, and impediment to normal social function, all of which must not be influenced by substance intake.<ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2000"/> It is most often related to intense emotional stress and occurs randomly.<ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2000"/> However, some argue that “running” syndromes are really not dissociative fugue, and have no proper Western medical classification.<ref name="Mezzich, Juan E 1996"/> Others contend that associating culturally bound symptoms with known ailments severely limits the discovery of new psychiatric disorders in folk culture.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Guarnaccia |first1=Peter J. |last2=Rogler |first2= Lloyd H.|title=Research on Culture-Bound Syndromes: New Directions |journal=[[The American Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=156 |issue=9 |pages=1322–7 |date=1 September 1999 |pmid=10484940 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=156&page=1322}}</ref> Edgardo Ruiz, PhD at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] argues that grisi siknis does not correlate with Western scientific cultural perspectives, and the cross-cultural translation of symptoms is an inaccurate device wherewith to understand the disease. <ref name="Ruiz CPH" />
 
== Causes ==
=== Miskito theories ===

Miskito tradition, according to Dennis, holds that grisi siknis is caused by possession by evil spirits.<ref name="Dennis 445-505" /> This belief stems from the combination of traditional Native American animism.<ref name=Focosi /> and Miskito Christian idea of the devil.<ref name="Dennis 445-505" /> When epidemic outbreaks of the disease occur, the Miskito hold that it is the result of an imbalance with spirits, says Nicola Ross, a reporter for ''The Walrus'' magazine,<ref name="Ross, Nicola 2006"/> which predicament they believe to be caused by a dilman or evil sorcerer.<ref name=Focosi />

=== Western theories ===
 
There is no definitively known cause of grisi siknis, although there are some theories which attempt to explain its origin. Although it has no discovered organic cause, says Dennis, grisi siknis still “follow[s] the classic model for contagious disease”.<ref name="Dennis 445-505" /> Dennis claims that grisi siknis is the source of the emotionally volatile Miskito culture, saying “it is clear that grisi siknis is related to emotional upset, worry, fear and general anxiety”, while microorganisms, if involved, are intermediate.<ref name="Dennis 445-505" /> Dr. Ronald C. Simons, professor emeritus of psychiatry and anthropology at [[Michigan State University]], as quoted by Nicola Ross in ''[[The Walrus]]'' magazine, upholds this argument, proposing that grisi siknis is caused by poverty and stress among the Miskito.<ref name="Ross, Nicola 2006"/> Culturally bound syndromes, Simons says, are often strongly influenced by behavior and experience and have become a local way of expressing misfortune.<ref name="Ross, Nicola 2006"/> Dr. Wolfgang Jilek, of the [[University of Columbia]]’s psychiatry department, also quoted by Ross in ''The Walrus'', calls culturally bound syndromes “real” despite a general lack of evidence for organic causes.<ref name="Ross, Nicola 2006"/> They are primarily the result of trauma and stress, Jilek claims, that end in mental dissociation problems.<ref name="Ross, Nicola 2006"/> Susan Kellogg, Associate Professor and Chair of the History Department at the [[University of Houston]], says that grisi siknis is the result of the cultural “physical and emotional stresses” that Miskito women endure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kellogg|first=Susan|title=Weaving the Past: a History of Latin America's Indigenous Women from the Prehispanic Period to the Present|year=2005|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=[[New York, NY]], [[USA]]|isbn=9780195183283|oclc=318402613}}</ref> Shlomo Ariel, Co-Director of the [[Integrative Psychotherapy Center]] in [[Ramat Gan]], [[Israel]], says that such disorders are the product of the culture, delineates  acceptable coping mechanisms for dealing with external or internal changes.<ref name="Ariel, Shlomo 1999">{{cite book|last=Ariel|first=Shlomo|title=Culturally Competent Family Therapy: a General Model|series=Contributions in Psychology|volume=37|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=[[Westport, CT]], [[USA]]|isbn=9780313310799|oclc=756506493|issn=0736-2714}}</ref> In a typical homeostatic function, Ariel says, “emotional or behavioral disorders in the individual are defined as such by the culture”, which culture subsequently imposes treatment in order to restore equilibrium.<ref name="Ariel, Shlomo 1999"/> Grisi siknis can be considered a ritualized behavior associated with the adolescent to adult transition  among the Miskito, says Mark Jamieson, professor of social anthropology at the [[University of Manchester]].<ref name="Jamieson 257-72">{{cite journal|last1=Jamieson|first1=Mark|title=Mask and madness.

== Cures ==

Grisi siknis is generally only cured by traditional Miskito healing methods, according to ''The Journal of the American Botanical Council''.<ref name ="Herbs and Healing">{{cite journal|last=Barrett|first=B.|title=Herbs and healing on Nicaragua's Atlantic Coast|journal=HerbalGram|volume=41|date=Fall 1997|pages=35–48|location=[[Austin, TX]], [[USA]]|publisher=American Botanical Council|issn=0899-5648}}</ref> In treating the ailment, the Miskito typically follow a hierarchy of remedies, turning first to home-based remedies, second to modern health facilities and finally to [[curandero]] or witch doctors, the latter particularly, if evil spirits are believed to be involved.<ref name ="Herbs and Healing" /> These healers use an assortment of vapor baths, anointing, teas and potions, all of which are organically derived.<ref name ="Herbs and Healing" /> According to Dennis, the Miskito healers use a variety of undisclosed steamed herbal remedies that are generally more successful than any Western medicine.<ref name="Dennis 445-505" /> However, the cures can be counteracted, Dennis says, by exposure to dead people, pregnant women and various meats.<ref name="Dennis 445-505" />

== Notable cases ==

Cases of grisi siknis were registered in [[Nicaragua]] in March 2009 in [[Puerto Cabezas]] and [[Siuna]] where many students of the National Institute of Technology and other schools, suffered attacks. Most of the victims were girls. The Miskito people argued that it was due to the action of black sorcerers to oblige the people to pay the expensive cures. Some scholars in the country conclude that it is due to the extreme poverty that the Miskito people endure and that was worsened by [[Hurricane Felix]] of September 2007.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[EFE]]|url=http://caracol.com.co/nota.aspx?id=781724|title=Brote de locura colectiva ataca a indígenas miskitos de Nicaragua|publisher=Caracol Radio|location=Bogotá|date=20 de marzo de 2009. |language=Spanish|accessdate=20 March 2009}}</ref><ref>La Prensa: Gris siknis ataca otra vez en la RAAN, [[Managua]], 20 de marzo de 2009.
