'''Diabetes mellitus type&nbsp;1''' (also known as '''type&nbsp;1 diabetes''', or '''T1DM'''; formerly '''insulin dependent diabetes''' or '''juvenile diabetes''') is a form of [[diabetes mellitus]] that results from [[autoimmune]] destruction of [[insulin]]-producing [[beta cells]] of the [[pancreas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://autoimmune.pathology.jhmi.edu/diseases.cfm?systemID=3&DiseaseID=23 |title=Type&nbsp;1 Diabetes Mellitus |accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref>  The subsequent lack of insulin leads to increased blood and urine glucose.  The classical symptoms are [[polyuria]] (frequent urination), [[polydipsia]] (increased thirst), [[polyphagia]] (increased hunger), and weight loss.<ref name="Cooke DW, Plotnick L 2008 374–84; quiz 385">{{cite journal |author=Cooke DW, Plotnick L |title=Type 1 diabetes mellitus in pediatrics |journal=Pediatr Rev |volume=29 |issue=11 |pages=374–84; quiz 385 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=18977856 |doi=10.1542/pir.29-11-374 }}</ref>

Incidence varies from 8 to 17 per 100,000 in Northern Europe and the U.S. with a high of about 35 per 100,000 in Scandinavia to a low of 1 per 100,000 in Japan and China.<ref name="Harrison's"/>

Eventually, type&nbsp;1 diabetes is fatal unless [[insulin therapy|treated with insulin]]. Injection is the most common method of administering insulin, although another method is [[insulin pump]]s. Other alternatives are [[Pancreatic transplant]]s that have been used, as well as pancreatic islet cell transplantation. Transplantation is experimental yet growing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chinese-school.netfirms.com/diabetes-type-1-cure.html |title=One Step Closer to a Cure—Interview; Patrick Perry, Saturday Evening Post |accessdate=2008-11-02}}</ref>

Most people who develop type&nbsp;1 are otherwise healthy.<ref>{{cite report|title=BMI & Diabetes|publisher=[[Drexel University|Drexel U]]|url=http://www.idea.library.drexel.edu/bitstream/1860/2806/1/Markowitz_Jessica.pdf |accessdate=25 November 2009 }}</ref>  Although the cause of type&nbsp;1 diabetes is still not fully understood, it is believed to be of immunological origin.

Type&nbsp;1 can be distinguished from [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type&nbsp;2 diabetes]] via a [[C-peptide]] assay, which measures endogenous insulin production.

Type 1 treatment must be continued indefinitely in all cases.  Treatment should not significantly impair normal activities but can be done adequately if sufficient patient training, awareness, appropriate care, discipline in testing and dosing of insulin is taken. However, treatment remains quite burdensome for many people.  Complications may be associated with both [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]] and [[Hyperglycemia|high blood sugar]], both largely due to the nonphysiological manner in which insulin is replaced. Low blood sugar may lead to seizures or episodes of unconsciousness, and requires emergency treatment.  High blood sugar may lead to increased fatigue and can also result in long-term damage to organs.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Main symptoms of diabetes.png|thumb|Overview of the most significant symptoms of diabetes]]
The classical symptoms of type 1 diabetes include: [[polyuria]] (frequent urination), [[polydipsia]] (increased thirst), [[Xerostomia]] (dry mouth), [[polyphagia]] (increased hunger), fatigue, and weight loss.<ref name="Cooke DW, Plotnick L 2008 374–84; quiz 385"/>
Type 1 diabetics are often first diagnosed when they present with [[diabetic ketoacidosis]].  These symptoms could be [[Dry_skin|xeroderma]] (dry skin), rapid deep breathing, drowsiness, [[abdominal pain]], and [[vomiting]].<ref>{{cite web|title=webmd Symptoms Type I Diabetes|url=http://diabetes.webmd.com/guide/type-1-diabetes-symptoms}}</ref>

== Cause ==
Diabetes type 1 is induced by one or more of the following: genetic susceptibility, a diabetogenic trigger and/or exposure to a driving [[The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young|antigen]].<ref name=knip2005>{{cite doi|10.2337/diabetes.54.suppl_2.S125}}</ref>

===Genetics===
Type&nbsp;1 diabetes is a [[polygenic]] disease, meaning many different genes contribute to its onset. Depending on locus or combination of loci, it can be dominant, recessive, or somewhere in between. The strongest gene, ''[[IDDM1]]'', is located in the [[MHC Class II]] region on chromosome 6, at staining region 6p21. Certain variants of this gene increase the risk for decreased [[histocompatibility]] characteristic of type&nbsp;1. Such variants include DRB1 0401, DRB1 0402, DRB1 0405, DQA 0301, DQB1 0302 and DQB1 0201, which are common in North Americans of European ancestry and in Europeans.<ref name=jeffrey2010/> Some variants also appear to be protective.<ref name=jeffrey2010/>

The risk of a child developing type 1 diabetes is about 10% if the father has it, about 10% if a sibling has it, about 4% if the mother has type 1 diabetes and was aged 25 or younger when the child was born, and about 1% if the mother was over 25 years old when the child was born.<ref>[http://www.joslin.org/info/genetics_and_diabetes.html Genetics & Diabetes], Diabetes Information. Dr. Warram. Joslin Diabetes Center and Joslin Clinic</ref>

===Environmental===
Environmental factors can influence expression of type&nbsp;1. For identical twins, when one twin had type&nbsp;1 diabetes, the other twin only had it 30%–50% of the time. Despite having exactly the same genome, one twin had the disease, where the other did not; this suggests environmental factors, in addition to genetic factors, can influence disease prevalence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/222100 |title=OMIM Entry – %222100 – DIABETES MELLITUS, INSULIN-DEPENDENT; IDDM |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref> Other indications of environmental influence include the presence of a 10-fold difference in occurrence among Caucasians living in different areas of Europe, and a tendency to acquire the incidence of the disease of the destination country for people who migrate.<ref name=knip2005/>

==== Virus ====
One theory, discussed by DeLisa Fairweather and Noel R. Rose, among others,<ref>"[http://www.nature.com/ni/journal/v3/n4/full/ni0402-338.html Nature Immunology 3", 338 – 340 (2002), ] {{doi|10.1038/ni0402-338}}</ref>  proposes that type&nbsp;1 diabetes is a [[virus]]-triggered autoimmune response in which the immune system attacks virus-infected cells along with the beta cells in the pancreas.  The [[Coxsackie B4 virus|Coxsackie virus]] family or [[rubella]] is implicated, although the evidence is inconclusive. In type&nbsp;1, pancreatic [[beta cells]] in the [[islets of Langerhans]] are destroyed, decreasing endogenous [[insulin]] production. This distinguishes type&nbsp;1's origin from type&nbsp;2.  The type of diabetes a patient has is determined only by the cause—fundamentally by whether the patient is insulin resistant (type&nbsp;2) or insulin deficient without insulin resistance (type&nbsp;1).

This vulnerability is not shared by everyone, for not everyone infected by the suspected virus develops type&nbsp;1 diabetes. This has suggested presence of a genetic vulnerability<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/82/1/143 |title=CTLA4 Alanine-17 Confers Genetic Susceptibility to Graves’ Disease and to type&nbsp;1 Diabetes Mellitus |accessdate=2008-02-06 |last="Donner"|first="Horst" |coauthors="Harald Rau, Paul G. Walfish, Jens Braun, Thorsten Siegmund, Reinhard Finke, Jürgen Herwig, Klaus H. Usadel and Klaus Badenhoop" |date="2007" |work="The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism Vol. 82, No. 1 143–146"|publisher="The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism"}}</ref> and there is indeed an observed inherited tendency to develop type&nbsp;1. It has been traced to particular [[human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] genotypes, though the connection between them and the triggering of an autoimmune reaction is still poorly understood.

====Diet====
Some researchers believe the autoimmune response is influenced by [[antibodies]] against [[cow's milk]] proteins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/327/5/302 |title=content.nejm.org |publisher=content.nejm.org |accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref> No connection has been established between [[autoantibody|autoantibodies]], antibodies to cow's milk proteins, and type&nbsp;1 diabetes. [[Latent autoimmune diabetes|A subtype of type&nbsp;1]] (identifiable by the presence of antibodies against beta cells) typically develops slowly, so is often confused with type&nbsp;2. In addition, a small proportion of type 2 cases manifest a genetic form of the disease called [[maturity onset diabetes of the young]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

[[Vitamin D]] in doses of 2000 IU per day given during the first year of a child's life has been connected in one study in northern [[Finland]] (where intrinsic production of Vitamin D is low due to low natural light levels) with an 80% reduction in the risk of getting type&nbsp;1 diabetes later in life. The causal connection, if any, is obscure.

Having a short breastfeeding period as well as short attendance at day care are associated with an elevated risk of type 1 diabetes in [[Czechs|Czech]] children.<ref>{{cite journal |

====Chemicals and drugs====
Some chemicals and drugs preferentially destroy pancreatic cells. [[Pyrinuron]] (Vacor, N-3-pyridylmethyl-N'-p-nitrophenyl urea), a rodenticide introduced in the United States in 1976, selectively destroys pancreatic beta cells, resulting in type&nbsp;1 diabetes after accidental or intentional ingestion. Vacor was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 1979, but is still used in some countries. Zanosar is the trade name for [[streptozotocin]], an [[antibiotic]] and [[antineoplastic]] agent used in chemotherapy for [[pancreatic cancer]]; it also kills beta cells, resulting in loss of insulin production. Other pancreatic problems, including trauma, [[pancreatitis]] or tumors (either malignant or benign), can also lead to loss of insulin production.

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology in diabetes type 1 is basically a destruction of [[beta cell]]s in the pancreas, regardless of which risk factors or causative entities have been present.

Individual risk factors can have separate pathophysiological processes to, in turn, cause this beta cell destruction. Still, a process that appears to be common to most risk factors is an [[autoimmune response]] towards [[beta cell]]s, involving an expansion of autoreactive CD4+ [[T helper cell]]s and CD8+ T cells, [[autoantibody]]-producing [[B cell]]s and activation of the [[innate immune system]].<ref name=jeffrey2010>{{cite doi|10.1038/nature08933}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Chatzigeorgiou A, Harokopos V, Mylona-Karagianni C, Tsouvalas E, Aidinis V, Kamper EF |title=The pattern of inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in type 1 diabetic patients over time |journal=Ann.

==Diagnosis==
{{See also|Glycated hemoglobin|Glucose tolerance test}}
{{OGTT}}
Diabetes mellitus is characterized by recurrent or persistent hyperglycemia, and is diagnosed by demonstrating any one of the following:<ref name="WHO1999-DefDiagClass">{{cite web|author=[[World Health Organisation]] Department of Noncommunicable Disease Surveillance|title=Definition, Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus and its Complications|year=1999|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1999/WHO_NCD_NCS_99.2.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

* Fasting plasma glucose level at or above 7.0&nbsp;mmol/L (126&nbsp;mg/dL).
* [[Plasma glucose]] at or above 11.1&nbsp;mmol/L (200&nbsp;mg/dL) two hours after a 75&nbsp;g oral glucose load as in a [[glucose tolerance test]].
* Symptoms of hyperglycemia and casual plasma glucose at or above 11.1&nbsp;mmol/L (200&nbsp;mg/dL).
* [[Glycated hemoglobin]] (hemoglobin A1C) at or above 6.5. (This criterion was recommended by the [[American Diabetes Association]] in 2010, although it has yet to be adopted by the [[WHO]].)<ref>{{cite web|publisher=American Diabetes Association|url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/33/Supplement_1/S3.full|title="Diabetes Care" January 2010|accessdate=2010-01-29}}</ref>

About a quarter of people with new type&nbsp;1 diabetes have developed some degree of diabetic [[ketoacidosis]] (a type of metabolic acidosis which is caused by high concentrations of ketone bodies, formed by the breakdown of fatty acids and the deamination of amino acids) by the time the diabetes is recognized. The diagnosis of other types of diabetes is usually made in other ways. These include ordinary health screening, detection of hyperglycemia during other medical investigations, and secondary symptoms such as vision changes or unexplainable fatigue. Diabetes is often detected when a person suffers a problem that may be caused by diabetes, such as a heart attack, stroke, [[neuropathy]], poor wound healing or a foot ulcer, certain eye problems, certain [[Fungal infection in animals|fungal infection]]s, or delivering a baby with [[macrosomia]] or hypoglycemia.

A positive result, in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, should be confirmed by a repeat of any of the above-listed methods on a different day. Most physicians prefer to measure a fasting glucose level because of the ease of measurement and the considerable time commitment of formal glucose tolerance testing, which takes two hours to complete and offers no prognostic advantage over the fasting test.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Saydah SH, Miret M, Sung J, Varas C, Gause D, Brancati FL |title=Postchallenge hyperglycemia and mortality in a national sample of U.S. adults |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=1397–402 |year=2001 |month=August |pmid=11473076 |doi=10.2337/diacare.24.8.1397}}</ref> According to the current definition, two fasting glucose measurements above 126&nbsp;mg/dL (7.0&nbsp;mmol/L) is considered diagnostic for diabetes mellitus.

Patients with fasting glucose levels from 100 to 125&nbsp;mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9&nbsp;mmol/L) are considered to have [[impaired fasting glycemia|impaired fasting glucose]]. Patients with plasma glucose at or above 140&nbsp;mg/dL (7.8&nbsp;mmol/L), but not over 200&nbsp;mg/dL (11.1&nbsp;mmol/L), two hours after a 75 g oral glucose load are considered to have [[impaired glucose tolerance]]. Of these two pre-diabetic states, the latter in particular is a major risk factor for progression to full-blown diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.<ref>{{cite web|author=Santaguida PL, Balion C, Hunt D, Morrison K, Gerstein H, Raina P, Booker L, Yazdi H|url=http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/epcsums/impglusum.htm|title=Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Treatment of Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Impaired Fasting Glucose|work=Summary of Evidence Report/Technology Assessment, No. 128|publisher=[[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]]|accessdate=2008-07-20}}</ref>

===Autoantibodies===
The appearance of diabetes-related [[autoantibodies]] has been shown to be able to predict the appearance of diabetes type 1 before any hyperglycemia arises, the main ones being [[islet cell autoantibodies]], [[insulin autoantibodies]], autoantibodies targeting the 65-[[Atomic mass unit|kDa]] isoform of [[glutamic acid decarboxylase]] (GAD) and autoantibodies targeting the [[phosphatase]]-related [[Insulinoma-associated autoantibodies|IA-2]] molecule.<ref name=knip2005/> By definition, the diagnosis of diabetes type 1 can be made first at the appearance of clinical symptoms and/or signs, but the emergence of autoantibodies may itself be termed "[[latent autoimmune diabetes]]". Not everyone with autoantibodies progresses to diabetes type 1, but the risk increases with the number of antibody types, with three to four antibody types giving a risk of progressing to diabetes type 1 of 60%–100%.<ref name=knip2005/> The time interval from emergence of autoantibodies to frank diabetes type 1 can be a few months in infants and young children, but in some people it may take years – in some cases more than 10 years.<ref name=knip2005/> Islet cell autoantibodies are detected by conventional [[immunofluorescence]], while the rest are measured with specific [[radiobinding assay]]s.<ref name=knip2005/>

==Prevention==
Type&nbsp;1 diabetes is not currently preventable.<ref name=WHO11>{{cite web|title=Diabetes|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs312/en/index.html|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=24 January 2011}}</ref> Some researchers believe it might be prevented at the [[latent autoimmune diabetes|latent autoimmune]] stage, before it starts destroying beta cells.<ref name=jeffrey2010/>

===Immunosuppressive drugs===
[[Cyclosporine A]], an [[immunosuppressive agent]], has apparently halted destruction of beta cells (on the basis of reduced insulin usage), but its [[nephrotoxicity]] and other side effects make it highly inappropriate for long-term use.<ref name=jeffrey2010/>

Anti-[[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]] antibodies, including [[teplizumab]] and [[otelixizumab]], had suggested evidence of preserving insulin production (as evidenced by sustained [[C-peptide]] production) in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients.<ref name=jeffrey2010/> A probable mechanism of this effect was believed to be preservation of [[regulatory T cell]]s that suppress activation of the immune system and thereby maintain immune system homeostasis and tolerance to self-antigens.<ref name=jeffrey2010/> The duration of the effect is still unknown, however.<ref name=jeffrey2010/> In 2011, Phase III studies with otelixizumab and teplizumab both failed to show clinical efficacy, potentially due to an insufficient dosing schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biospace.com/news_story.aspx?StoryID=213614&full=1 |title='&#39;Tolerx, Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Announce Phase 3 Defend-1 Study of Otelixizumab in Type 1 Diabetes Did Not Meet Its Primary Endpoint'&#39; |publisher=Biospace |accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macrogenics.com/press_releases-284.html |title=Macrogenics press release: '&#39;MacroGenics and Lilly Announce Pivotal Clinical Trial of Teplizumab Did Not Meet Primary Efficacy Endpoint'&#39; |publisher=Macrogenics.com |date=20 October 2010 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref>

An anti-[[CD20]] antibody, [[rituximab]], inhibits [[B cell]]s and has been shown to provoke [[C-peptide]] responses three months after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, but long-term effects of this have not been reported.<ref name=jeffrey2010/>

===Diet===
Some research has suggested [[breastfeeding]] decreases the risk in later life;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Borch-Johnsen K, Joner G, Mandrup-Poulsen T, ''et al.'' |title=Relation between breast-feeding and incidence rates of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

== Management ==
{{See|Diabetes management}}

===Insulin therapy===
Type&nbsp;1 is treated with [[insulin replacement therapy]]—either via subcutaneous injection or [[insulin pump]], along with attention to dietary management, typically including [[carbohydrate]] tracking, and careful monitoring of [[blood glucose]] levels using [[glucose meter]]s. Today, the most common insulins are biosynthetic products produced using genetic recombination techniques; formerly, cattle or pig insulins were used, and even sometimes insulin from fish.<ref>Dr James R Wright, Jr MD, in [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T1B-45JG4XK-12&_user=10&_coverDate=04/06/2002&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1441488132&_rerunOrigin=google&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=b9e7dbc307ee8f8067eca8c54b220e06 The Lancet, Volume 359, Issue 9313]</ref> Major global suppliers include [[Eli Lilly and Company]], [[Novo Nordisk]], and [[Sanofi-Aventis]]. A more recent trend, from several suppliers, is [[insulin analog]]s which are slightly modified insulins with different onset or duration of action times.

Untreated type&nbsp;1 diabetes commonly leads to coma, often from [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], which is fatal if untreated. Ketoacidosis causes [[cerebral edema]] (accumulation of liquid in the brain). This complication is very life-threatening; it makes ketoacidosis the most common cause of death in pediatric
diabetes.<ref>http://ww2.ispad.org/pdf/clin-2.pdf</ref>

Continuous glucose monitors have been developed and marketed which can alert patients to the presence of dangerously high or low blood sugar levels, but technical limitations have limited the impact these devices have had on clinical practice so far.

Treatment of diabetes focuses on lowering blood sugar or glucose (BG) to the near normal range, approximately 80–140&nbsp;mg/dl (4.4–7.8&nbsp;mmol/L).<ref>American Diabetes Association Clinical Guidelines, 2010.</ref> The ultimate goal of normalizing BG is to avoid long-term complications that affect the nervous system (e.g. peripheral neuropathy leading to pain and/or loss of feeling in the extremities), and the cardiovascular system (e.g. heart attacks, vision loss). People with type 1 diabetes always need to use insulin, but treatment can lead to low BG ([[hypoglycemia]]), i.e. BG less than 70&nbsp;mg/dl (3.9&nbsp;mmol/l). Hypoglycemia is a very common occurrence in people with diabetes, usually the result of a mismatch in the balance among insulin, food and physical activity, although the nonphysiological method of delivery also plays a role.

=== Pancreas transplantation ===
{{Main|Pancreas transplantation}}

In more extreme cases, a pancreas transplant can restore proper glucose regulation. However, the surgery and accompanying [[immunosuppression]] required is considered by many physicians to be more dangerous than continued insulin replacement therapy, so is generally only used with or some time after a [[kidney]] transplant. One reason for this is that introducing a new kidney requires taking [[immunosuppressive drugs]] such as cyclosporine. Nevertheless this allows the introduction of a new, functioning pancreas to a patient with diabetes without any additional immunosuppressive therapy. However, pancreas transplants alone can be wise in patients with extremely [[Brittle diabetes|labile]] type&nbsp;1 diabetes mellitus.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jennifer L. Larsen |url=http://edrv.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/25/6/919 |title=Pancreas Transplantation: Indications and Consequences |publisher=Edrv.endojournals.org |accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref>

=== Islet cell transplantation ===
{{Main|Islet cell transplantation}}

Experimental replacement of beta cells (by transplant or from [[stem cells]]) is being investigated in several research programs. Islet cell transplantation is less invasive than a pancreas transplant, which is currently the most commonly used approach in humans.

In one variant of this procedure, islet cells are injected into the patient's [[liver]], where they take up residence and begin to produce insulin. The liver is expected to be the most reasonable choice because it is more accessible than the pancreas, and islet cells seem to produce insulin well in that environment. The patient's body, however, will treat the new cells just as it would any other introduction of foreign tissue, unless a method is developed to produce them from the patient's own stem cells or an identical twin is available who can donate stem cells. The [[immune system]] will attack the cells as it would a bacterial infection or a skin graft. Thus, patients now also need to undergo treatment involving [[immunosuppressants]], which reduce immune system activity.

Recent studies have shown islet cell transplants have progressed to the point where 58% of the patients in one study were insulin-independent one year after transplantion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/islet-cell-transplant/DA00046|title=Islet cell transplant: Experimental treatment for type&nbsp;1 diabetes |accessdate=2007-06-04|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070410214823/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/islet-cell-transplant/DA00046 |archivedate = 10 April 2007}}</ref> Scientists in New Zealand with Living Cell Technologies are currently in human trials with Diabecell, placing pig islets within a protective capsule derived of seaweed which enables insulin to flow out and nutrients to flow in, while protecting the islets from immune system attack via white blood cells.

Through the Stem Cell Education process the patient's lymphocytes are modified by the Autoimmune Regulator [[AIRE]] that activates certain [[genes]] due to contact with the cord blood stem cells.

The clinical trial ([http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01350219 NCT01350219]) reveals that a single treatment with the Stem Cell Educator provides lasting reversal of autoimmunity that allows improvement of metabolic control<ref>{{cite journal

in subjects with long-standing type 1 diabetes. The on-going phase II clinical study about Stem Cell Educator Therapy has proved 100% effectiveness in type 1 diabetics, even in patients who lost the ability to produce their own insulin ([[C-peptide]] < 0,01 µg/l before treatment). 

After treatment, the increased expression of co-stimulating molecules (specifically, [[CD28]] and [[CD278|ICOS]]), increases in the number of [[CD4]]+[[CD25]]+[[Foxp3]]+ [[Tregs]], and restoration of [[Th1_cell|Th1]]/[[Th2]]/[[Th3]] [[cytokine]] balance indicate this therapy reverses [[autoimmunity]], induces [[Immune_tolerance|tolerance]] and promotes regeneration of islet beta cells<ref>{{cite journal

without showing any adverse effects so far.

Successful immune modulation by cord blood stem cells and the resulting clinical improvement in patient status may have important implications for other autoimmune diseases but does not raise any safety or ethical issues.

==Psychological effects of Type 1 Diabetes==

===Depression===
[[Depression (mood)|Depression]] and depressive symptoms are generally more common in people living with Type 1 Diabetes. One review article suggested that the prevalence rate of depression is more than three times higher in diabetics than non-diabetics; an average prevalence of 12% was found (range of 5.8%-43.4% in studies reviewed)<ref>Roy, T., & Lloyd, C. E. (2012). Epidemiology of depression and Diabetes: A systematic review.

[Epub ahead of print]</ref> Recent evidence has suggested that reduced pre-frontal cortical thickness is associated with depression in people with Type 1 Diabetes. These neurological changes may be caused by long-term reduced glycemic control and may increase risk of depression.<ref>Lyoo, I. K., Yoon, S., Jacobson, A. M., Hwang, J., Musen, G., Kim, J.

===Eating Disorders===
Recent research has found that [[eating disorders]] are more common in females with Type 1 Diabetes<ref>Colton, P. A., Olmsted, M. P., Daneman D., & Rodin, G. M. (2013). Depression, disturbed eating behavior, and metabolic control in teenage girls with Type 1 Diabetes. Pediatric Diabetes, Feb 19. doi: 10.1111/pedi.12016.</ref>  (prevalence = 10.15%) than in females without it (prevalence = 4.5%), as were sub-threshold eating disorders (13.8% vs. 7.6%)<ref>Jones, Jennifer Michelle. (2000). Eating disorders in adolescent females with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: A controlled three-site study. ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing. NQ49954.</ref> Some participants (11.0%) in the same study reported manipulating insulin dosages to promote weight loss. Higher blood-sugar levels are associated with polyuria and reduced appetite, which can result in weight loss. Similarly, mean hemoglobin A1c levels were higher in participant with a DSM-IV disorder (9.4%) than those without (8.6%). This behavior was reported by 42% of participant who had a DSM-IV disorder.

The disorder of omission of insulin for weight control has been named [[diabulimia]], a portmanteau of diabetes and [[bulimia]], although it is not currently recognized as a formal diagnosis in the medical community.

===Social Cognition and Self-Care===
Results from recent research suggest that people with Type 1 Diabetes may neglect precise self-care due to social fear related to fear of hypoglycemia. <ref>•	Di Battista, Ashley M., Hart, Trevor A., Greco, & Laurie, Gloizer. (2009). Type 1 Diabetes among adolesents: Reduced Diabetes self-care caused by social fear of hypoglycemia.

==Complications==
{{See|Complications of diabetes mellitus}}
Complications of poorly managed type 1 diabetes mellitus may include [[cardiovascular disease]], [[diabetic neuropathy]], and [[diabetic retinopathy]], among others.  However, cardiovascular disease<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v42/n1/full/ng.493.html |title=Sridevi Devaraj, Nicole Glaser, Steve Griffen, Janice Wang-Polagruto, Eric Miguelino and Ishwarlal Jialal; "Increased Monocytic Activity and Biomarkers of Inflammation in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes"; '&#39;Diabetes'&#39; 2006 March 55: 774–779 |publisher=Nature.com |accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref> as well as neuropathy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/28/8/1959 |title=Viktoria Granberg, MD, Niels Ejskjaer, MD, PHD, Mark Peakman, MD, PHD and Göran Sundkvist, MD, PHD; "Autoantibodies to Autonomic Nerves Associated With Cardiac and Peripheral Autonomic Neuropathy"; '&#39;Diabetes Care'&#39; 2005 28: 1959–1964 |publisher=Care.diabetesjournals.org |accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref> may have an autoimmune basis, as well.

===Driving===
Studies conducted in the United States<ref>Songer, TJ.

Diabetes can compromise driving safety in several ways. First, long-term complications of diabetes can interfere with the safe operation of a vehicle. For example, [[diabetic retinopathy]] (loss of peripheral vision or visual acuity), or [[peripheral neuropathy]] (loss of feeling in the feet) can impair a driver’s ability to read street signs, control the speed of the vehicle, apply appropriate pressure to the brakes, etc.

Second, hypoglycemia can affect a person’s thinking processes, coordination, and state of [[consciousness]].<ref name="Cox">{{cite journal | author = Cox DJ, Gonder-Frederick LA, Clarke WL | year = 1993 | title = Driving decrements in type 1 diabetes during moderate hypoglycemia | url = | journal = [[Diabetes (journal)|]] | volume = 42 | issue = 2| pages = 239–243 | pmid = 8425660 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Clarke WL, Cox DJ, Gonder-Frederick LA, Kovatchev B | year = 1999 | title = Hypoglycemia and the Decision to Drive a Motor Vehicle by Persons With Diabetes | url = | journal = [[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] | volume = 282 | issue = 8| pages = 750–754 | doi = 10.1001/jama.282.8.750 }}</ref> This disruption in brain functioning, [[neuroglycopenia]], can impair driving ability.<ref name="Cox" /><ref>{{cite journal | author = Cox D, Gonder-Frederick LA, Kovatchev BP, Julian DM, Clarke WL | year = 2000 | title = Progressive hypoglycemia's impact on driving simulation performance | url = | journal = [[Diabetes Care]] | volume = 23 | issue = 2| pages = 163–170 | doi = 10.2337/diacare.23.2.163 }}</ref> A study involving people with type 1 diabetes found that individuals reporting two or more hypoglycemia-related driving mishaps differ physiologically and behaviorally from their counterparts who report no such mishaps.<ref name="Cox_a">{{cite journal |doi=10.2337/dc09-2130| pmid= 20699432 | pmc=2963507 | volume=33 | issue=11 | title=Type 1 diabetic drivers with and without a history of recurrent hypoglycemia-related driving mishaps: physiological and performance differences during euglycemia and the induction of hypoglycemia | year=2010 | month=November | author=Cox DJ, Kovatchev BP, Anderson SM, Clarke WL, Gonder-Frederick LA | journal=Diabetes Care | pages=2430–5}}</ref> For example, during hypoglycemia, drivers who had two or more mishaps reported fewer warning symptoms, their driving was more impaired, and their body released less [[epinephrine]] (a hormone that helps raise BG). Additionally, individuals with a history of hypoglycemia-related driving mishaps appear to use sugar at a faster rate<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cox DJ, Gonder-Frederick LA, Kovatchev BP, Clarke WL | year = 2002 | title = The metabolic demands of driving for drivers with type 1 diabetes mellitus | url = | journal = Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Review | volume = 18 | issue = 5| pages = 381–385 | doi = 10.1002/dmrr.306 }}</ref> and are relatively slower at processing information.<ref>Campbell LK, Gonder-Frederick LA, Broshek DK, Kovatchev BP, Anderson S, Clarke WL & Cox DJ (2010).

''[[International Journal of Diabetes in Developing Countries]]'', 2(2), 73–77. NIHMS[211748]</ref> These findings indicate that although anyone with type 1 diabetes may be at some risk of experiencing disruptive hypoglycemia while driving, there is a subgroup of type 1 drivers who are more vulnerable to such events.

Given the above research findings, drivers with type 1 diabetes and a history of driving mishaps are recommended to never drive when their BG is less than 70&nbsp;mg/dl. Instead, these drivers are advised to treat hypoglycemia and delay driving until their BG is above 90&nbsp;mg/dl.<ref name="Cox_a" /> Such drivers should also learn as much as possible about what causes their hypoglycemia, and use this information to avoid future hypoglycemia while driving.

Studies funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) have demonstrated that face-to-face training programs designed to help individuals with type 1 diabetes better anticipate, detect, and prevent extreme BG can reduce the occurrence of future hypoglycemia-related driving mishaps.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cox DJ, Gonder-Frederick LA, Julian D, Clarke W | year = 1994 | title = Long-term follow-up evaluation of blood glucose awareness training | url = | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 1–5 | pmid = 8112183 | doi = 10.2337/diacare.17.1.1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Cox DJ, Gonder-Frederick LA, Polonsky W, Schlundt D, Julian D, Kovatchev B, Clarke WL | year = 2001 | title = Blood Glucose Awareness Training (BGAT-II): Long term benefits | url = | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 637–642 | pmid = 11315822 | doi = 10.2337/diacare.24.4.637 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Broers S., le Cessie S., van Vliet KP, Spinhoven P., van der Ven NC, Radder JK | year = 2002 | title = Blood glucose awareness training in Dutch type 1 diabetes patients | url = | journal = Diabet.

Type 1 diabetes was previously known as juvenile diabetes to distinguish it from type 2 diabetes, which generally has a later onset; however, the majority of new-onset type 1 diabetes is seen in adults. Studies using antibody testing ([[glutamic acid decarboxylase]] antibodies, [[islet cell antibodies]], and [[insulinoma-associated autoantibodies]]) to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes demonstrate that most new-onset type 1 diabetes is seen in adults.  Adult-onset type 1 autoimmune diabetes is two to three times more common than classic childhood-onset autoimmune diabetes.<ref>''Type 1 Diabetes in Adults: Principles and Practice'', Informa Healthcare, 2008, p. 27.</ref>

===Economics===
In the US in 2008, about one million people were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. The disease was estimated to cause $10.5 billion in annual medical costs ($875 per month per diabetic) and an additional $4.4 billion in indirect costs ($366 per month per diabetic).<ref name="usatoday"> {{cite news|author=Johnson, Linda|title=Study: Cost of diabetes $218B|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-11-18-diabetes-cost_N.htm|agency=Associated Press|year=2008|work=USA Today|date=18 November 2008}}</ref>

==Research==
===Foundations===
The [[Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation]] funds type 1 diabetes research and has offices in the UK, Denmark, USA, Canada, Australia, Israel, Mexico and India. The Diabetes Research Institute Foundation was founded by a group of parents of children with diabetes and funds research for a cure for type 1 diabetes. The [[International Diabetes Federation]] is a worldwide alliance of over 160 countries to address diabetes research and treatment.

The [[American Diabetes Association]] funds ''some'' type&nbsp;1 research along with other a variety of diabetes-related research (not necessarily cure-specific), including type&nbsp;2 diabetes, [[gestational diabetes]] and others) that looks at treatments and prevention, as well as some cure-specific research. [[Diabetes Australia]] is involved in promoting research and education in Australia on both type&nbsp;1 and type&nbsp;2 diabetes. The [[Canadian Diabetes Association]] is involved in educating, researching, and sustaining type&nbsp;1 diabetes patients in Canada. Pacific Northwest Diabetes Research Institute conducts clinical and basic research on type&nbsp;1 and type&nbsp;2 diabetes.

===T helper cell shift===
If a biochemical mechanism can be found to prevent the immune system from attacking beta cells, it may be administered to prevent commencement of diabetes type&nbsp;1. Several groups are trying to achieve this by causing the activation state of the immune system to change from type 1 [[T helper cell]] (Th1) state ("attack" by killer T Cells) to Th2 state (development of new antibodies). This Th1-Th2 shift occurs via a change in the type of [[cytokine]] signaling molecules being released by T-cells. Instead of proinflammatory cytokines, the T-cells begin to release cytokines that inhibit inflammation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/105/8/1043 |title=jci.org |publisher=jci.org |date=15 April 2000 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref> This phenomenon is commonly known as "acquired [[immune tolerance]]".

==Brittle diabetes==
[[Insulin]]-dependent [[diabetes]] characterized by dramatic and recurrent swings in [[glucose]] levels, often occurring for no apparent reason, is sometimes known as brittle diabetes, unstable diabetes or labile diabetes, although some experts say the "brittle diabetes" concept "has no biologic basis and should not be used".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec12/ch158/ch158b.html#sec12-ch158-ch158b-1206 |title=Diabetes Mellitus (DM): Diabetes Mellitus and Disorders of Carbohydrate Metabolism: Merck Manual Professional |publisher=Merck.com |accessdate=2010-07-30}}</ref> The results of such swings can be irregular and unpredictable [[hyperglycemia]]s, frequently involving [[ketosis]], and sometimes serious [[hypoglycemia]]s.

Because brittle diabetes is defined as "episodes of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia that, whatever their cause, constantly disrupt a patient's life", it can have many causes, some of which include:<ref name=Davidson />

* errors in diabetes management, which can include too much insulin being given.

* interactions with other medical conditions.

* psychological problems.

* biological factors that interfere with how insulin is processed within the body.

One of these biological factors is the production of insulin [[autoantibodies]].  High antibody titers can cause episodes of hyperglycemia by neutralizing the insulin, cause clinical [[insulin resistance]] requiring doses of over 200 IU/day.  However, antibodies may also fail to buffer the release of the injected insulin into the bloodstream after subcutaneous injection, resulting in episodes of hypoglycemia.  In some cases, changing the type of insulin administered can resolve this problem.<ref name=Davidson>{{cite journal|url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/14/11/1109.1.full.pdf|title=Successful Treatment of Unusual Case of Brittle Diabetes With Sulfated Beef Insulin|journal=Diabetes Care|date=1991-11|volume=14|pages=1109–10|author=Davidson MB ''et al.''|issue=11|pmid=1797500|last2=Kumar|first2=D|last3=Smith|first3=W}}</ref>  There have been a number of reports that insulin autoantibodies can act as a "sink" for insulin and affect the time to peak, half-life, distribution space, and metabolic clearance, though in most patients these effects are small.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://edrv.endojournals.org/content/28/6/625.full|title=Immunological Responses to Exogenous Insulin|author=S.
