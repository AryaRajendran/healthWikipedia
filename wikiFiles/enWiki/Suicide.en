<!--Definition and Risk factors -->
'''Suicide''' ([[Latin]] ''suicidium'', from ''sui caedere'', "to kill oneself") is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Suicide is often committed out of [[Despair (emotion)|despair]], the cause of which is frequently attributed to a [[mental disorder]] such as [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], alcoholism, or [[Substance abuse|drug abuse]].<ref name="Hawton2009">{{cite journal |author=Hawton K, van Heeringen K |title=Suicide |journal=Lancet |volume=373 |issue=9672 |pages=1372–81 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19376453 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60372-X}}</ref> Stress factors such as [[financial difficulties]] or troubles with [[interpersonal relationship]]s often play a role. Efforts to prevent suicide include limiting access to firearms, treating mental illness and drug misuse, and improving economic development. 

<!--Method and Epidemiology  -->
The most commonly used method of suicide varies by country and is partly related to availability. Common methods include: [[hanging]], [[pesticide poisoning]], and firearms. Around 800,000 to a million people die by suicide every year, making it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide.<ref name="Hawton2009" /><ref name="Var2012" /> Rates are higher in men than in women, with males three to four times more likely to kill themselves than females.<ref>{{cite book|last=Meier|first=Marshall B.

<!--History, society and culture  -->
Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, [[honor]], and the [[meaning of life]]. The [[Abrahamic religions]] traditionally consider suicide an [[sin|offense towards God]] due to the belief in the [[sanctity of life]]. During the [[samurai]] era in Japan, [[seppuku]] was respected as a means of atonement for failure or as a form of protest. [[Sati (practice)|Sati]], a now outlawed [[Hindu funeral]] practice, expected the [[Widow#Widows in Indian culture|widow]] to [[self-immolation|immolate]] herself on her husband's funeral pyre, either willingly or under pressure from the family and society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/news/words/general/020807_witn.shtml|title=Indian woman commits sati suicide |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2002-08-07 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref>

Suicide and attempted suicide, while previously criminally punishable, is no longer in most Western countries. It remains a criminal offense in most Islamic countries. In the 20th and 21st centuries, suicide in the form of [[self-immolation]] has been used as a medium of protest, and [[kamikaze]] and [[suicide bombings]] have been used as a military or terrorist tactic.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Aggarwal|first=N|title=Rethinking suicide bombing.|journal=Crisis|year=2009|volume=30|issue=2|pages=94–7|pmid=19525169|doi=10.1027/0227-5910.30.2.94}}</ref>

{{Main|Religious views on suicide}}
[[File:A Hindoo Widow Burning Herself with the Corpse of her Husband.jpg|thumb|A [[Hindu]] widow burning herself with the corpse of her husband, 1820s.]]
In most forms of Christianity, suicide is considered a [[sin]], based mainly on the writings of influential Christian thinkers of the [[Middle Ages]], such as [[St. Augustine]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]; but suicide was not considered a sin under the [[Byzantine]] Christian [[code of Justinian]], for instance.<ref>{{cite web |author=Dr. Ronald Roth, D.Acu. |url=http://www.acu-cell.com/suicide.html |title=Suicide & Euthanasia – a Biblical Perspective |publisher=Acu-cell.com |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/nholland/suicide.htm |title=Norman N. Holland, Literary Suicides: A Question of Style |publisher=Clas.ufl.edu |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> In Catholic doctrine, the argument is based on the [[Ten Commandments|commandment]] "Thou shalt not kill" (made applicable under the [[New Covenant]] by Jesus in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew 19:18]]), as well as the idea that life is a gift given by God which should not be spurned, and that suicide is against the "natural order" and thus interferes with God's master plan for the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c2a5.htm#2280 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church – PART 3 SECTION 2 CHAPTER 2 ARTICLE 5 |publisher=Scborromeo.org |date=1941-06-01 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> 

However, it is believed that mental illness or grave fear of suffering diminishes the responsibility of the one completing suicide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c2a5.htm#2282 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church – PART 3 SECTION 2 CHAPTER 2 ARTICLE 5 |publisher=Scborromeo.org |date=1941-06-01 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> Counter-arguments include the following: that the [[Ten Commandments|sixth commandment]] is more accurately translated as "thou shalt not murder," not necessarily applying to the self; that God has given free will to humans; that taking one's own life no more violates God's Law than does curing a disease; and that a number of suicides by followers of God are recorded in the Bible with no dire condemnation.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.religioustolerance.org/sui_bibl.htm |title=The Bible and Suicide |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>

Judaism focuses on the importance of valuing this life, and as such, suicide is tantamount to denying God's goodness in the world. Despite this, under extreme circumstances when there has seemed no choice but to either be killed or forced to betray their religion, Jews have committed individual suicide or [[mass suicide]] (see [[Masada]], [[History of the Jews in France#First persecution of the Jews|First French persecution of the Jews]], and [[York Castle]] for examples) and as a grim reminder there is even a prayer in the Jewish liturgy for "when the knife is at the throat," for those dying "to sanctify God's Name" (see [[Martyrdom]]). These acts have received mixed responses by Jewish authorities, regarded by some as examples of heroic martyrdom, while others state that it was wrong for them to take their own lives in anticipation of martyrdom.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.religionfacts.com/euthanasia/judaism.htm |title=Euthanasia and Judaism: Jewish Views of Euthanasia and Suicide |accessdate=2008-09-16 |publisher=ReligionFacts.com}}</ref>

Suicide is not allowed in Islam.<ref name="Islam2006" /> In [[Hinduism]], suicide is generally frowned upon and is considered equally sinful as murdering another in contemporary Hindu society. [[Hindu texts|Hindu Scriptures]] state that one who commits suicide will become part of the spirit world, wandering earth until the time one would have otherwise died, had one not committed suicide.<ref>Hindu Website. [http://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/h_suicide.asp Hinduism and suicide]</ref> However, Hinduism accepts a man's [[right to die|right to end one's life]] through the non-violent practice of fasting to death, termed ''[[Prayopavesa]]''.<ref name="hindu">{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/euthanasia.shtml|title= Hinduism – Euthanasia and Suicide|date= 2009-08-25|publisher= BBC}}</ref> But Prayopavesa is strictly restricted to people who have no desire or ambition left, and no responsibilities remaining in this life.<ref name="hindu" /> [[Jainism]] has a similar practice named ''[[Santhara]]''. [[sati (practice)|Sati]], or self-immolation by widows was prevalent in Hindu society during the Middle Ages.

=== Philosophy ===

{{Main|Philosophy of suicide}}
[[File:The way out.jpg|thumb|''The Way Out, or [[Suicidal ideation|Suicidal Ideation]]'': [[George Grie]], 2007.]]
A number of questions are raised within the philosophy of suicide, included what constitutes suicide, whether or not suicide can be a rational choice, and the moral permissibility of suicide.<ref name="StanfordSuicide">{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/suicide/ |title=Suicide (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> Philosophical arguments in regard to whether or not suicide can be morally acceptable range from strong opposition, (viewing suicide as unethical and immoral), through to perceptions of suicide as a [[sacrosanct]] right for anyone (even a young and healthy person) who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives.

Supporters of this position maintain that no one should be forced to suffer against their will, particularly from conditions such as incurable disease, mental illness, and old age that have no possibility of improvement. They reject the belief that suicide is always irrational, arguing instead that it can be a valid last resort for those enduring major pain or trauma.<ref>Raymond Whiting: A natural right to die: twenty-three centuries of debate, pp. 13–17; Praeger (2001) ISBN 0-313-31474-8</ref> A stronger stance would argue that people should be allowed to autonomously choose to die regardless of whether they are suffering. Notable supporters of this [[school of thought]] include Scottish empiricist [[David Hume]]<ref name="StanfordSuicide" /> and American bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]].<ref name="pmid17649899" /><ref>[[Wesley J. Smith]], Death on Demand: The assisted-suicide movement sheds its fig leaf, ''The Weekly Standard'', June 5, 2007</ref>

Advocacy of suicide has occurred in many cultures and [[subculture]]s. The [[Japanese military]] during World War II encouraged and glorified [[kamikaze]] attacks, which were suicide attacks by military aviators from the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels in the closing stages of the Pacific campaign of World War II.
