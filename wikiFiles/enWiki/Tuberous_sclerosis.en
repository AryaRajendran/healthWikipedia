Tuberous sclerosis or '''tuberous sclerosis complex''' ('''TSC''') is a rare multi-system [[genetic disorder|genetic disease]] that causes non-malignant tumors to grow in the [[human brain|brain]] and on other vital organs such as the [[kidney]]s, [[human heart|heart]], [[human eye|eye]]s, [[human lung|lung]]s, and [[human skin|skin]]. A combination of symptoms may include [[seizure]]s, [[Mental retardation|developmental delay]], behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, lung and kidney disease. TSC is caused by a [[mutation]] of either of two [[gene]]s, [[TSC1]] and [[TSC2]], which code for the [[protein]]s hamartin and tuberin respectively. These proteins act as [[Tumor suppressor gene|tumor growth suppressors]], agents that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation.<ref name=NINDS>{{cite web

The name, composed of the Latin ''tuber'' (swelling) and the Greek ''skleros'' (hard), refers to the [[pathological]] finding of thick, firm and pale [[gyrus|gyri]], called "tubers," in the brains of patients [[postmortem]]. These tubers were first described by [[Désiré-Magloire Bourneville]] in 1880; the cortical manifestations may sometimes still be known by the [[eponym]] '''Bourneville's disease'''.

== Signs and symptoms ==
{{See also|List of dental abnormalities associated with cutaneous conditions}}
The physical manifestations of tuberous sclerosis are due to the formation of [[Hamartia#Medicine|hamartia]] (malformed tissue such as the cortical tubers),hamartomas (benign growths such as facial [[Fibroma#Other types of fibroma|angiofibroma]] and subependymal nodules) and, very rarely, cancerous [[hamartoblastoma]]s. The effect of these on the brain leads to neurological symptoms such as seizures, mental retardation, developmental delay and behavioral problems. Symptoms also include trouble in school and concentration problems.

=== Central nervous system ===
[[File:Tuberoese Sklerose 1J T2 axial2.png|thumb|Tuberous sclerosis in MRI.]]

Lower IQ is associated with more brain involvement on MRI.

Three types of brain tumours may be associated with TSC:
* Giant cell astrocytoma: (grows and blocks the CSF flow leading to dilatation of ventricles causing headache and vomiting)
* Cortical tubers: after which the disease is named.
* Sub-ependymal nodules: form in the walls of ventricles.

Classic intracranial manifestations of tuberous sclerosis include sub[[ependyma]]l nodules and cortical/subcortical tubers.<ref name="brain-mapping">{{cite journal

| pmid = 15563011}}</ref>

The tubers are typically triangular in configuration, with the apex pointed towards the ventricles, and are thought to represent foci of abnormal neuronal migration. The T2 signal abnormalities may subside in adulthood, but will still be visible on histopathological analysis. On [[MR|magnetic resonance imaging]], TSC patients can exhibit other signs consistent with abnormal neuron migration (radial white matter tracts hyperintense on T2WI, heterotopic gray matter).

Subependymal nodules are composed of abnormal, swollen glial cells and bizarre multinucleated cells which are indeterminate for glial or neuronal origin. There is no interposed neural tissue. These nodules have a tendency to calcify as the patient ages. A nodule that markedly enhances and enlarges over time should be considered suspicious for transformation into a [[subependymal giant cell astrocytoma]] (SEGA). A SEGA typically develops in the region of the [[interventricular foramina|foramen of Monro]], in which case it is at risk of developing an obstructive [[hydrocephalus]].

A variable degree of ventricular enlargement, either obstructive (e.g. by a subependymal nodule in the region of the foramen of Monro) or idiopathic in nature.

=== Kidneys ===
[[File:Angiomyolipome TubSklerose cor.jpg|thumb|right|Computed tomography showing multiple angiomyolipomas of the kidney in a patient with lung lymphangioleiomyomatosis on CT: suspected tuberous sclerosis.]]
Between 60 and 80% of TSC patients have benign tumors (once thought hamartomatous, but now considered true neoplasms) of the kidneys called [[angiomyolipoma]]s (AML) frequently causing [[hematuria]]. These tumors are composed of [[Blood vessel|vascular]] tissue (''angio&ndash;''), [[smooth muscle]] (''&ndash;myo&ndash;''), and [[fat]] (''&ndash;[[lipoma]]''). Although benign, an AML larger than 4&nbsp;cm is at risk for a potentially catastrophic hemorrhage either spontaneously or with minimal trauma. AMLs are found in about 1 in 300 people without TSC. However, those are usually solitary, whereas in TSC they are commonly multiple and bilateral.

Approximately 20-30% of people with TSC will have renal cysts, causing few problems. However, 2% may also have [[autosomal dominant]] [[polycystic kidney disease]].

Very rare (< 1%) problems include [[renal cell carcinoma]] and [[oncocytoma]]s ([[benign adenomatous hamartoma]]).
<br style="clear:both;">

=== Lungs ===
Patients with TSC can develop progressive replacement of the lung parenchyma with multiple cysts. This process is identical to another disease called [[lymphangioleiomyomatosis]] (LAM). Recent genetic analysis has shown that the proliferative bronchiolar smooth muscle in tuberous sclerosis-related LAM is monoclonal '''metastasis''' from a coexisting renal angiomyolipoma. There have been cases of TSC-related LAM recurring following lung transplant.<ref name="LAM in TBS">{{cite journal

}}</ref>

=== Heart ===
[[Rhabdomyoma]]s are benign tumors of striated muscle. A cardiac rhabdomyoma can be discovered using [[echocardiography]] in approximately 50% of people with TSC. However, the incidence in the newborn may be as high as 90% and in adults as low as 20%. These tumors grow during the second half of pregnancy and regress after birth. Many will disappear entirely. Alternatively, the tumor size remains constant as the heart grows, which has much the same effect.

Problems due to rhabdomyomas include obstruction, [[Cardiac arrhythmia|arrhythmia]] and a [[Heart murmur|murmur]]. Such complications occur almost exclusively during pregnancy or within the child's first year.

Prenatal ultrasound, performed by an [[Obstetric ultrasonography|obstetric sonographer]] specializing in cardiology, can detect a rhabdomyoma after 20 weeks. This rare tumour is a strong indicator of TSC in the child, especially if there is a family history of TSC.

=== Skin ===
Some form of dermatological sign will be present in 96% of individuals with TSC. Most cause no problems but are helpful in diagnosis. Some cases may cause disfigurement, necessitating treatment. The most common skin abnormalities include:

* Facial angiofibromas ("adenoma sebaceum"): A rash of reddish spots or bumps, which appear on the nose and cheeks in a [[malar rash|butterfly distribution]]. They consist of blood vessels and fibrous tissue. This socially embarrassing rash starts to appear during childhood and can be removed using [[dermabrasion]] or laser treatment.
* Periungual fibromas: Also known as [[Koenen's tumor]]s, these are small fleshy tumors that grow around and under the toenails or fingernails and may need to be surgically removed if they enlarge or cause bleeding. These are very rare in childhood but common by middle age. They are generally more common on toes than on ﬁngers, develop  at  15–29  years  and  are  more common in women than in men. They can be induced by nail-bed trauma.
* Hypomelanic [[macules]] ("ash leaf spots"): White or lighter patches of skin that may appear anywhere on the body and are caused by a lack of [[melanin]]. These are usually the only visible sign of TSC at birth. In fair-skinned individuals a [[Wood's lamp]] ([[ultraviolet]] light) may be required to see them.
* Forehead plaques: Raised, discolored areas on the forehead.
* Shagreen patches: Areas of thick leathery skin that are dimpled like an orange peel,pigmented and usually found on the lower back or nape of the neck. They  can  also  be  scattered  across  the trunk or thighs. The frequency of these lesions rises with age. 
* Other skin features are not unique to individuals with TSC, including molluscum fibrosum or skin tags, which typically occur across the back of the neck and shoulders, [[café au lait spot|''café au lait'' spots]] or flat brown marks, and poliosis, a tuft or patch of white hair on the scalp or eyelids.

=== Eyes ===
Retinal lesions, called astrocytic hamartomas (or "phakomas"), which appear as a greyish or yellowish-white lesion in the back of the globe on the ophthalmic examination. Astrocytic hamartomas can calcify, and they are in the differential diagnosis of a calcified globe mass on a [[computed tomography|CT]] scan.

Non-retinal lesions associated with TSC include
* [[Coloboma]]
* Angiofibromas of the eyelids
* [[Papilledema]] (related to hydrocephalus)

=== Variability ===
Individuals with tuberous sclerosis may experience none or all of the clinical signs discussed above. The following table shows the prevalence of some of the clinical signs in individuals diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis.<br style="clear:both;">

TSC1 and TSC2 are both [[tumor suppressor gene]]s that function according to [[Knudson hypothesis|Knudson's "two hit" hypothesis]]. That is, a second random mutation must occur before a tumor can develop. This explains why, despite its 100 percent [[penetrance]], TSC has wide [[expressivity]].

== Pathophysiology ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

Hamartin and tuberin function as a complex which is involved in the control of cell growth and cell division. (The complex appears to interact with [[Rheb]] [[GTPase]], thus sequestering it from activating [[Mammalian target of rapamycin|mTOR]] signalling, part of the [[growth factor]] ([[insulin]]) signalling pathway.) Thus, mutations at the TSC1 and TSC2 loci result in a loss of control of cell growth and cell division, and therefore a predisposition to forming tumors. TSC affects tissues from different germ layers. Cutaneous and visceral lesions may occur, including adenoma sebaceum, cardiac rhabdomyomas, and renal angiomyolipomas. The central nervous system (CNS) lesions seen in this disorder include hamartomas of the cortex, hamartomas of the ventricular walls, and subependymal giant cell tumors, which typically develop in the vicinity of the foramina of Monro.

Molecular genetic studies have defined at least two loci for TSC. In TSC1, the abnormality is localized on chromosome 9q34, but the nature of the gene protein, called hamartin, remains unclear. No missense mutations occur in TSC1. In TSC2, the gene abnormalities are on chromosome 16p13. This gene encodes tuberin, a guanosine triphosphatase–activating protein. The specific function of this protein is unknown. In TSC2, all types of mutations have been reported; new mutations occur frequently. Few differences have yet been observed in the clinical phenotypes of patients with mutation of one gene or the other.

== Diagnosis ==
There are no [[pathognomonic]] clinical [[medical sign|signs]] for tuberous sclerosis. Many signs are present in individuals who are healthy (although rarely), or who have another disease. A combination of signs, classified as major or minor, is required in order to establish a clinical diagnosis.

* '''Probable''' – One major plus one minor feature.
* '''Suspect''' – Either one major feature or two or more minor features.

Due to the wide variety of mutations leading to TSC, there are no simple [[Genetic testing|genetic tests]] available to identify new cases. Nor are there any [[Biomarker (medicine)|biochemical markers]] for the gene defects.<ref name="TSC-diagnosis"/> However, once a person has been clinically diagnosed, the genetic mutation can usually be found.

The patients usually have relapse of symptoms in the clinical course. Unless any vital function is affected, life expectancy is good. Majority of patients will require some medications to control symptoms, e.g., anti-epileptics to control seizures.

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis for individuals with TSC depends on the severity of symptoms, which range from mild skin abnormalities to varying degrees of learning disabilities and epilepsy to severe mental retardation, uncontrollable seizures, and kidney failure. Those individuals with mild symptoms generally do well and live long productive lives, while individuals with the more severe form may have serious disabilities. However, with appropriate medical care, most individuals with the disorder can look forward to normal life expectancy.<ref name="TSFactSheet"/>

A study of 30 TSC patients in Egypt found that "...earlier age of seizures commencement (<6 months) is associated with poor seizure outcome and poor intellectual capabilities. Infantile spasms and severely epileptogenic EEG patterns are related to the poor seizure outcome, poor intellectual capabilities and autistic behavior. Higher tubers numbers is associated with poor seizure outcome and autistic behavior. Left sided tuber burden is associated with poor intellect, while frontal location is more encountered in ASD. So, close follow up for the mental development and early control of seizures are recommended in a trial to reduce the risk factors of poor outcome. Also early diagnosis of autism will allow for earlier treatment and the potential for better outcome for children with TSC."<ref name="pmid20817577">{{cite journal | author = Samir H, Ghaffar HA, Nasr M | title = Seizures and intellectual outcome: Clinico-radiological study of 30 Egyptian cases of tuberous sclerosis complex | journal = Eur J Paediatr Neurol | volume = 15| issue = 2| pages = 131–137| year = 2010 | month = September | pmid = 20817577 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejpn.2010.07.010 | url =  }}</ref>

Detection of the disease should prompt one for genetic
counselling. It is also important to know that even though
the disease does not have a cure, symptoms can be treated
symptomatically. Hence, awareness regarding different
organ manifestations of tuberous sclerosis is important.

== Epidemiology ==
Tuberous sclerosis occurs in all races and ethnic groups, and in both genders. The [[Live birth (human)|live-birth]] [[prevalence]] is estimated to be between 10 and 16 cases per 100,000. A 1998 study estimated total population prevalence between about 7 and 12 cases per 100,000, with more than half of these cases undetected.<ref name="TSC-prevalence">{{cite journal

| pmid=9605811}}</ref> These estimates are significantly higher than those produced by older studies, when tuberous sclerosis was regarded as an extremely rare disease. The reason is that the invention of [[CT scan|CT]] and [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] scanning have enabled the diagnosis of many non-symptomatic cases. Prior to this, the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis was largely restricted to severely affected individuals with Vogt's triad of learning disability, seizures and facial angiofibroma. The total population prevalence figures have steadily increased from 1:150,000 in 1956, to 1:100,000 in 1968, to 1:70,000 in 1971, to 1:34,200 in 1984, to the present figure of 1:12,500 in 1998. Whilst still regarded as a [[rare disease]], it is common when compared to many other genetic diseases.<ref name="TSC-diagnosis"/>

== History ==
{{Main|Timeline of tuberous sclerosis}}
[[File:Désiré-Magloire Bourneville.jpg|thumb|Désiré-Magloire Bourneville]]
Tuberous sclerosis first came to medical attention when dermatologists described the distinctive facial rash (1835 and 1850). A more complete case was presented by [[Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen|von Recklinghausen]] (1862) who identified heart and brain tumours in a newborn that had only briefly lived. However, [[Désiré-Magloire Bourneville|Bourneville]] (1880) is credited with having first characterized the disease, coining the name ''tuberous sclerosis'', thus earning the [[eponym]] Bourneville's disease. The neurologist [[Heinrich Vogt|Vogt]] (1908) established a diagnostic triad of epilepsy, idiocy, and adenoma sebaceum (an obsolete term for facial angiofibroma).<ref name="TSC-history">Curatolo (2003), chapter: "Historical Background".</ref>

Symptoms were periodically added to the clinical picture. The disease as presently understood was first fully described by [[Manuel Rodríguez Gómez|Gomez]] (1979). The invention of [[Medical ultrasonography|medical ultrasound]], [[computed tomography|CT]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] has allowed physicians to examine the internal organs of live patients and greatly improved diagnostic ability.

Two genetic loci associated with tuberous sclerosis, TSC1 and [[TSC2]], were discovered in 1997 and 1992 respectively. This has enabled the use of genetic testing as a diagnostic tool.<ref name="TSC-history"/> The proteins associated with TSC1 and TSC2, harmartin and tuberin, function as a complex in the [[Mammalian target of rapamycin|mTOR]] signalling pathway that controls cell growth and cell division. The importance of this pathway in cancer therapy has stimulated further research into Tuberous Sclerosis.

In 2002, treatment with [[rapamycin]] was found to be effective at shrinking tumours in animals. This has led to human trials of rapamycin as a drug to treat several of the tumors associated with Tuberous Sclerosis.<ref name="Rott2005">{{cite web
