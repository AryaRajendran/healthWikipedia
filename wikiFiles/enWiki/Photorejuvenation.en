'''Photorejuvenation''' is a skin treatment that uses [[intense pulsed light]] or other thermal or chemical methods to treat some [[skin condition]]s and remove [[wrinkles]] arising from [[photoaging]].  The process induces controlled wounds on the skin, prompting it to heal itself by creating new cells. This process reverses the effects of photoaging to a certain extent by removing wrinkles.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lim|first=Henry W. |coauthors= Herbert Honigsmann, John L. M.

==Types==
There are three types of skin rejuvenation:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourplasticsurgeryguide.com/roundtables/roundtable-photo-rejuvenation.htm|title=Photo Rejuvenation for Better-Looking Skin: What Doctors Are Saying|accessdate=2009-07-02}}</ref>

# Thermal rejuvenation using a radio-frequency device to induce a thermal effect in the skin.
# Chemical rejuvenation with [[chemical peel]]s.
# Photo rejuvenation with [[laser]], intense pulse light, light.
<!--All 3 need to be discussed fully in this article: The latter will be discussed in greater detail in this article.-->

==Laser resurfacing==
Laser resurfacing is a technique used during [[laser surgery]] wherein [[molecular bonds]] are disassociated by laser. It is used for the treatment of wrinkles, [[Lentigo maligna|solar lentigene]]s, [[Sunburn|sun damage]], [[scar]]s (see [[acne scar treatment]]), [[stretch marks]], [[actinic keratosis]] and [[telangiectasia]]s or "spider veins".

It can be combined with [[liposuction]] to remove excess fat from the chin and jaw area.  The skin may be wrinkled after fat is removed and laser resurfacing can help tighten and smooth over the new contours.

Laser resurfacing is usually done with a 2940&nbsp;nm [[Er:YAG laser]] or a 10,600&nbsp;nm [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] laser.  Complete resurfacing was first done with a CO<sub>2</sub> laser.  More commonly now, laser resurfacing is done with a fractional laser.  The term fractional pertains to the method in which the laser light is transferred.  Tiny pinpoints of laser light are used to deliver the laser to the surface of the skin in only a fraction of the area.  Several hundred or thousands of laser pinpoints may be used per square inch, leaving healthy skin in between the [[ablation|ablated]] areas, to allow more rapid healing and lower risk.

Skin resurfacing can also be performed with a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]-based device instead of a laser.  At least one manufacturer of such a plasma device{{Who|date=July 2009}} claims "It’s the only treatment proven to generate new skin, at the fundamental levels, for as long as a year after treatment".<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/52311.php Portrait(R) Plasma Skin Regeneration]</ref>  However these claims do not have supporting evidence published in a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[medical journal]], and have not been verified by any independently funded studies. When used proficiently, it has been shown to be significantly more precise in control, while producing less bleeding, bruising and post-operative discomfort compared to other skin resurfacing methods.<ref>[http://www.plasticsurgeryguide.com/laser-skin-resurfacing.html Laser Skin Resurfacing] Plastic Surgery Guide</ref>

Fractional [[photothermolysis]] (FP) is another form of laser treatment with several devices currently on the market. Some doctors claim FP provides similar results to CO<sub>2</sub> laser resurfacing without risk of scarring or significant downtime.  As of January 2008, there are a number of papers referenced on [[PubMed]] which mostly support those claims.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  Complications observed in a study of 961 treatments included [[acne|acneiform eruptions]] (1.87%) and [[herpes simplex]] [[virus outbreak]]s (1.77%).  Side effects and complications observed in this study were of a temporary nature.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=18190541 PMID 18190541 Side effects and complications of fractional laser photothermolysis: experience with 961 treatments]</ref> There have been, however, anecdotal negative accounts of bad scarring and [[hyperpigmentation]] without any findings of [[infection]].<ref>[http://www.realself.com/review/fraxel-laser-horrible “Adverse Effects Fraxel Repair”]</ref>

When compared to a chemical peel, [[dermabrasion]] or other forms of laser treatment, a laser allows the surgeon to customize the surgery not only for each patient but also to each area of the face.

CO<sub>2</sub> laser resurfacing has been shown to have an increased risk of [[hypopigmentation]] and scarring when compared to the erbium lasers. This is due to the high degree of coagulation and thus heat production that occurs as a nature of the CO<sub>2</sub> wavelength. Both Erbium and Co2 fractional systems have a better safety profile than lasers of the past.

Both Erbium and CO<sub>2</sub> are used to treat deep [[rhytide]]s, [[Sunburn|sun damage]] and [[age spots]]. Through the heating of the deep [[dermis]], [[fibroblasts]] are stimulated to form new [[collagen]] and [[elastin]] helping to bring increased turgor and thickness to the skin.

==Side effects of IPL usage in Mechanical Photorejuvenation==
Beginning in the late 1990s, a number of studies have been performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of IPL on wrinkle-removal and rejuvenation of the skin.  One such study conducted by a group of four researchers from the [[Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University]] and published in the [[Journal of Drugs in Dermatology]] in 2004 found IPL to be a "non-invasive, non-ablative method for rejuvenating photoaged skin with minimal adverse events".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sadick NS, Weiss R, Kilmer S, Bitter P|date=January 2004|journal=Journal of Drugs in Dermatology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=41–49|url=http://jddonline.com/|pmid=14964745|first1=NS|last2=Weiss|first2=R|last3=Kilmer|first3=S|last4=Bitter|first4=P|title=Photorejuvenation with intense pulsed light: results of a multi-center study}}</ref>

An article published in the [[Journal of Investigative Dermatology]] in 2010 found that exposing cells to direct heat can cause DNA damage not only in those cells but also in surrounding tissue that was not directly exposed, and concluded: "... treatments that cause thousands of microscopic thermal injuries in tissue produce a complicated interface between the directly heat-damaged and the surrounding “bystander“ tissue. Further studies related to such clinical implications are warranted."<ref name=pubmed>{{cite journal|title=Pubmed|pmid=19587691|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.
