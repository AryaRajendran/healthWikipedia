It is also approved for adjunctive therapy for epilepsy in patients who have not responded to first-line drugs and in children who are refractory to first-line drugs. It is not recommended for use in children between the ages of six months and three years, unless there is a compelling need.<ref name=clobazam_anxiety_UK /> In addition to epilepsy and severe anxiety, clobazam is also approved as a short term (2–4 weeks) adjunctive agent in [[schizophrenia]] and other [[psychotic disorder]]s to manage [[anxiety]] or [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]].<ref name=clobazam_anxiety_UK />

Clobazam is sometimes used for refractory epilepsies. However, long-term prophylactic treatment of epilepsy has considerable drawbacks, most importantly loss of antiepileptic effects due to tolerance which may render long-term therapy ineffective.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Isojärvi |first1=JI |last2=Tokola |first2=RA |title=Benzodiazepines in the treatment of epilepsy in people with intellectual disability |journal=Journal of intellectual disability research |volume=42 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=80–92 |year=1998 |pmid=10030438}}</ref> Other antiepileptic drugs may therefore be preferred for the long term management of epilepsy. Furthermore, benzodiazepines have the drawback, particularly after long-term use, of causing rebound seizures upon abrupt or over-rapid discontinuation of therapy forming part of the [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]].

===Availability===
Clobazam is available in oral form only, due to its insolubility in water.

==Side effects==
===Common===
*[[Ataxia]]
*[[Somnolence]]
*[[Diplopia]]
*[[Dysarthria]]

===Rare===
*[[Gelastic seizure]]s<ref name=|gelastic>{{cite journal |last1=Iwasaki |first1=T |last2=Miura |first2=H |last3=Sunaoshi |first3=W |last4=Hosoda |first4=N |last5=Takei |first5=K |last6=Katayama |first6=F |title=A case of intractable epilepsy showing frequent gelastic seizures by administration of clobazam |journal=No to hattatsu.

==Contraindications==
Clobazam should be used with great care in patients with the following disorders:
*[[Myasthenia gravis]]
*[[Sleep apnea]]
*Severe [[liver]] diseases such as [[cirrhosis]] and [[hepatitis]]<ref name=clobazamliver>{{cite journal |last1=Monjanel-Mouterde |first1=Suzanne |last2=Antoni |first2=Michel |last3=Bun |first3=Hot |last4=Botta-Frindlund |first4=Danielle |last5=Gauthier |first5=André |last6=Durand |first6=Alain |last7=Cano |first7=Jean Paul |title=Pharmacokinetics of a Single Oral Dose of Clobazam in Patients with Liver Disease |journal=Pharmacology & Toxicology |volume=74 |pages=345–50 |year=1994 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0773.1994.tb01371.x |issue=4–5}}</ref>
*[[Respiration (physiology)|Respiratory]] problems, including [[hypoventilation]]

===Special caution===
Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with [[comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorders]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Authier |first1=N. |last2=Balayssac |first2=D. |last3=Sautereau |first3=M. |last4=Zangarelli |first4=A. |last5=Courty |first5=P. |last6=Somogyi |first6=A.A. |last7=Vennat |first7=B. |last8=Llorca |first8=P.-M. |last9=Eschalier |first9=A. |title=Benzodiazepine dependence: Focus on withdrawal syndrome |journal=Annales Pharmaceutiques Françaises |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=408–13 |year=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.pharma.2009.07.001 |pmid=19900604}}</ref>

==Tolerance and dependence==
In humans tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of clobazam frequently occurs<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Loiseau |first1=P |title=Benzodiazepines in the treatment of epilepsy |journal=L'Encephale |volume=9 |issue=4 Suppl 2 |pages=287B–292B |year=1983 |pmid=6373234}}</ref> and withdrawal seizures can occur during abrupt or overrapid withdrawal.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Robertson |first1=MM |title=Current status of the 1,4- and 1,5-benzodiazepines in the treatment of epilepsy: the place of clobazam |journal=Epilepsia |volume=27 Suppl 1 |pages=S27–41 |year=1986 |pmid=3527689}}</ref>

Clobazam as with other [[benzodiazepine]] drugs can lead to [[physical dependence]], [[Substance dependence|addiction]] and what is known as the [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]]. Withdrawal from clobazam or other benzodiazepines after regular use often leads to withdrawal symptoms which are similar to those seen during alcohol and [[barbiturate]] withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken for, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can however occur from standard dosages and also after short term use. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible via a slow and gradual dose reduction regime.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=MacKinnon |first1=Glenda L. |last2=Parker |first2=William A. |title=Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Syndrome: A Literature Review and Evaluation |journal=The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=19–33 |year=1982 |pmid=6133446 |doi=10.3109/00952998209002608}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Clobazam is an [[anticonvulsant]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chweh |first1=A |last2=Swinyard |first2=EA |last3=Wolf |first3=HH |last4=Kupferberg |first4=HJ |title=Effect of GABA agonists on the neurotoxicity and anticonvulsant activity of benzodiazepines |journal=Life Sciences |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=737–44 |year=1985 |pmid=2983169 |doi=10.1016/0024-3205(85)90193-6}}</ref> Clobazam is a 1,5-benzodiazepine, meaning that its [[diazepine]] ring has [[nitrogen]] atoms at the 1 and 5 positions (instead of the usual 1 and 4). Like other 1,5-benzodiazepines (e.g., [[arfendazam]], [[lofendazam]], [[CP-1414S]]), it has less [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the ω<sub>1</sub>-[[allosteric]] binding site on the [[GABA A receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]] compared to the 1,4-benzodiazepines. It has selective affinity for the ω<sub>2</sub> site, where it has [[agonist]]ic activity.<ref name=omega2>{{cite journal |last1=Nakajima |first1=Hiroyuki |title=A pharmacological profile of clobazam (Mystan), a new antiepileptic drug |journal=Folia Pharmacologica Japonica |volume=118 |issue=2 |pages=117–22 |year=2001 |pmid=11530681 |doi=10.1254/fpj.118.117}}</ref>

In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial published in 1990 comparing it to [[clonazepam]], 10&nbsp;mg or 20&nbsp;mg of clobazam was shown to be much less sedating than either 0.5&nbsp;mg or 1&nbsp;mg of clonazepam.<ref name=vsclonazepam>{{cite journal |last1=Wildin |first1=JD |last2=Pleuvry |first2=BJ |last3=Mawer |first3=GE |last4=Onon |first4=T |last5=Millington |first5=L |title=Respiratory and sedative effects of clobazam and clonazepam in volunteers |journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=169–77 |year=1990 |pmid=2106335 |pmc=1380080}}</ref>

The ω<sub>1</sub>-receptor, which is found on the α<sub>1</sub> subtype of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, was shown to be responsible for the sedative effects of [[diazepam]] by McKernan et al. in 2000, who also showed that its anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties could still be seen in mice whose α<sub>1</sub> receptors were insensitive to diazepam.<ref name=McKernan>{{cite journal |last1=McKernan |first1=R. M. |last2=Rosahl |first2=T. W. |last3=Reynolds |first3=D. S. |last4=Sur |first4=C. |last5=Wafford |first5=K. A. |last6=Atack |first6=J. R. |last7=Farrar |first7=S. |last8=Myers |first8=J. |last9=Cook |first9=G. |title=Sedative but not anxiolytic properties of benzodiazepines are mediated by the GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subtype |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=587–92 |year=2000 |pmid=10816315 |doi=10.1038/75761}}</ref> It would seem, then, that the anticonvulsant properties of clobazam are due to its selective affinity for ω<sub>2</sub>.

In 1996, Nakamura et al. reported that clobazam and its active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam (norclobazam), work by enhancing [[gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]]-activated [[chloride]] currents at GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor-coupled [[ion channel|Cl<sup>-</sup> channel]]s. It was also reported that these effects were inhibited by the GABA [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] [[flumazenil]], and that clobazam acts most efficiently in GABA-deficient [[brain]] tissue.<ref name=Nakamura_et_al_1996>{{cite journal |last1=Nakamura |first1=Fumihiro |last2=Suzuki |first2=Setsuo |last3=Nishimura |first3=Shigeko |last4=Yagi |first4=Kazuichi |last5=Seino |first5=Masakazu |title=Effects of Clobazam and Its Active Metabolite on GABA-Activated Currents in Rat Cerebral Neurons in Culture |journal=Epilepsia |volume=37 |issue=8 |pages=728–35 |year=1996 |pmid=8764810 |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1157.1996.tb00643.x}}</ref>

===Metabolism===
Clobazam has two major metabolites: N-desmethyl-clobazam and 4'-hydroxyclobazam, the former of which is active.<ref name=active-metabolite>{{cite journal |last1=Contin |first1=Manuela |last2=Sangiorgi |first2=Simonetta |last3=Riva |first3=Roberto |last4=Parmeggiani |first4=Antonia |last5=Albani |first5=Fiorenzo |last6=Baruzzi |first6=Agostino |title=Evidence of polymorphic CYP2C19 involvement in the human metabolism of N-desmethylclobazam |journal=Therapeutic Drug Monitoring |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=737–41 |year=2002 |pmid=12451290 |doi=10.1097/00007691-200212000-00009}}</ref> The demethylation is facilitated by [[CYP2C19]], [[CYP3A4]], and [[CYP2B6]] and the 4'-hydroxyclobazam by [[CYP2C18]] and CYP2C19.<ref name=Giraudetal2004>{{cite journal |last1=Cui |first1=D. |last2=Tran |first2=A |last3=Rey |first3=E |last4=Vincent |first4=J |last5=Tréluyer|first5=JM |last6=Pons |first6=G |title=In vitro characterization of clobazam metabolism by recombinant cytochrome P450 enzymes: importance of CYP2C19 |journal=Drug Metabolism and Disposition |volume=32 |issue=11 |pages=1279–86 |year=2004 |pmid=15483195 |url=http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15483195 |doi=10.1124/dmd.32.11.1279}}</ref>

*[[Alcohol]] increases bioavailability by 50%
*[[Cimetidine]] increases the effects of clobazam
*[[valproic acid|valproate]]s

==Overdose==
{{See also|Benzodiazepine overdose}}
Benzodiazepines usually are not fatal when taken alone in overdose but those with underlying health conditions for example respiratory disease or when benzodiazepines are taken in combination with other [[CNS depressant]] drugs can result in death.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Proenca |first1=P |last2=Teixeira |first2=H |last3=Pinheiro |first3=J |last4=Marques |first4=E |last5=Vieira |first5=D |title=Forensic intoxication with clobazam: HPLC/DAD/MSD analysis |journal=Forensic Science International |volume=143 |issue=2–3 |pages=205–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15240045 |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2004.03.029}}</ref>

==Abuse potential==
{{See also|Benzodiazepine drug misuse}}
Clobazam in animal studies has been shown to increase reward seeking behaviours which may suggest an increased risk of addictive behavioural patterns.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thiébot |first1=Marie-Hélène |last2=Bihan |first2=Claudine |last3=Soubrié |first3=Philippe |last4=Simon |first4=Pierre |title=Benzodiazepines reduce the tolerance to reward delay in rats |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=86 |issue=1–2 |pages=147–52 |year=1985 |pmid=2862657 |doi=10.1007/BF00431700}}</ref> Significant clobazam abuse has been reported in some countries, according to a 1983 World Health Organisation report.<ref>{{cite journal |author=WHO Review Group |year=1983 |title=Use and abuse of benzodiazepines |journal=Bull World Health Organ |volume=61 |pmid=6605211 |issue=4 |pages=551–562 |publisher=World Health Organisation |pmc=2536139}}</ref>
