A '''keratocystic odontogenic tumour''' (also '''keratocystic odontogenic tumor'''), abbreviated '''KCOT''',<ref name=madras>{{cite journal |author=Madras J, Lapointe H |title=Keratocystic odontogenic tumour: reclassification of the odontogenic keratocyst from cyst to tumour |journal=J Can Dent Assoc |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=165–165h |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18353202 |doi= |url=http://www.cda-adc.ca/jcda/vol-74/issue-2/165.html}}</ref> is a rare and [[benign]] but locally aggressive developmental [[cyst]]ic [[neoplasm]]. It most often affects the posterior [[human mandible|mandible]].

It was previously called '''''odontogenic keratocyst''''' and abbreviated '''''OKC'''''.<ref name=madras/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Mateus GC, Lanza GH, de Moura PH, Marigo Hde A, Horta MC |title=Cell proliferation and apoptosis in keratocystic odontogenic tumors |journal=Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal |volume=13 |issue=11 |pages=E697–702 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=18978709 |doi= |url=http://www.medicinaoral.com/medoralfree01/v13i11/medoralv13i11p697.pdf}}</ref> 

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Classic keratocystic odontogenic tumour.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Classic look to a keratocyctic odontogenic tumor in the right mandible in the place of a former wisdom tooth.  Unicystic lesion growing along the bone.]]
The definitive diagnosis is by [[histologic]] analysis, i.e. [[:wikt:excision|excision]] and examination under the microscope.  

Under the [[microscope]], KCOTs vaguely resemble [[keratinized]] [[squamous epithelium]];<ref>Thompson LDR. Head and neck pathology - (Foundations in diagnostic pathology). Goldblum JR, Ed.. Churchill Livingstone. 2006. ISBN 0-443-06960-3.</ref> however, they lack [[rete ridges]] and often have an artifactual separation from their [[basement membrane]].

==Etiology==
KCOTs are thought to arise from the [[dental lamina]] and associated with impacted teeth.  Multiple odontogenic keratocysts are a feature of [[nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome]].  
Odotogenic Keratocysts are derived from the Remnants of the Dental Lamina.

===Genetics===
Sporadic (non-syndromic) and [[syndrome|syndromic]] KCOTs are associated with mutations in the [[gene]] ''[[PTCH1|PTCH]]'', which is part of the [[Hedgehog signaling pathway]].<ref name=madras/><ref name=OMIM601309>PATCHED, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; PTCH1. [[OMIM]]. URL: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=601309 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=601309]. Accessed on: December 25, 2008.</ref>

==Symptoms==
Swelling is the most common presenting complaint; however, KCOTs may be asymptomatic and found incidentally on dental [[X-rays]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Habibi A, Saghravanian N, Habibi M, Mellati E, Habibi M |title=Keratocystic odontogenic tumor: a 10-year retrospective study of 83 cases in an Iranian population |journal=J Oral Sci |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=229–35 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17928730 |doi= 10.2334/josnusd.49.229|url=http://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.JSTAGE/josnusd/49.229?from=PubMed |format=}} {{dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref>

==Differential diagnosis==

Radiologically
*[[Dentigerous cyst]]
*[[Ameloblastoma]]

Histologically
*[[Orthokeratocyst]]

==Malignant transformation==
[[Malignant transformation]] to [[squamous cell carcinoma]] may occur, but is unusual.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Piloni MJ, Keszler A, Itoiz ME |title=Agnor as a marker of malignant transformation in odontogenic keratocysts |journal=Acta Odontol Latinoam |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=37–42 |year=2005 |pmid=16302459 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Treatment==

As the entity is quite rare, opinions among experts about how to treat KCOTs differ.  

Treatment options:<ref name=madras/>
*Wide (local) [[surgery|surgical]] excision.
*[[Marsupialization]] - the surgical opening of the (KCOT) cavity and a creation of a [[marsupial]]-like [[Pouch (marsupial)|pouch]], so that the cavity is in contact with the outside for an extended period, e.g. three months.
*[[Curettage]] (simple excision & scrape-out of cavity).
*Simple excision.
*[[Carnoy's solution]] - usually used in conjunction with excision.
* Enucleation and cryotherapy <ref>{{cite journal |author=Schmidt BL, Pogrel, MA, |title=The use of enucleation and liquid nitrogen cryotherapy in the management of odontogenic keratocysts.|journal=J Oral Maxillofac Surg. |volume=59 |pages=720–727 |year=2001 |pmid= |doi= |url=}}</ref>
