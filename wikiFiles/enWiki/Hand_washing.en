'''Hand washing''' for '''hand hygiene''' is the act of [[washing|cleaning]] ones [[hand]]s with or without the use of [[water]] or another [[liquid]], or with the use of [[soap]], for the purpose of removing [[soil]], [[dirt]], and/or [[microorganism]]s.

Medical hand [[hygiene]] pertains to the hygiene practices related to the administration of medicine and medical care that prevents or minimizes disease and the spreading of disease. The main medical purpose of washing hands is to cleanse the hands of [[pathogen]]s (including [[bacteria]] or [[virus]]es) and chemicals which can cause personal harm or disease. This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public. People can become infected with respiratory illnesses such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they don't wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. Indeed, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) has stated: "It is well documented that one of the most important measures for preventing the spread of pathogens is effective hand washing."  As a general rule, handwashing protects people poorly or not at all from droplet- and [[airborne disease]]s, such as [[measles]], [[chickenpox]], [[influenza]], and [[tuberculosis]].  It protects best against diseases [[transmission (medicine)|transmitted]] through [[fecal-oral route]]s (such as many forms of [[stomach flu]]) and direct physical contact (such as [[impetigo]]).

In addition to hand washing with soap and water, the use of [[hand sanitizer|alcohol gels]] is another form of killing some kinds of pathogens and healthful bacteria, but their effectiveness is disputed, and may lead to antibiotica-resistant bacterial strains.<ref name="Alcohol Hand Rubs completely ineffective">{{cite web| url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hand-washing/HQ00407| title = Hand-washing: Do's and don'ts | accessdate=2012-02-28 | publisher= Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research }}</ref><ref name="Alcohol Hand Rub and Hand Hygiene">{{cite web| url = http://www.cec.health.nsw.gov.au/pdf/AlcoholHandRub061013.pdf| title = Alcohol Sanitizer and Hand Hygiene | accessdate=2007-04-27 | publisher= Clinical Excellence Commission, Health, New South Wales, Australia }}</ref>

In symbolic hand washing, using water only to wash hands is a part of [[Ritual purification|ritual handwashing]] as a feature of many religions, including [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Ablution in Judaism|tevilah and netilat yadayim]] in [[Judaism]].  Similar to these are the practices of [[Lavabo]] in [[Christianity]], [[Wudu]] in [[Islam]] and [[Misogi]] in [[Shintō]].

==Substances used==
=== Soap and detergents===
Removal of microorganisms from skin is enhanced by the addition of soaps or detergents to water<ref>{{en}} [http://www.hi-tm.com/Documents/Handflow.html Standard Operating Procedure]</ref> The main action of soaps and [[detergents]] is to reduce barriers to solution, and increase solubility.. Water is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats, and proteins, which are components of organic soil are not readily dissolved in water. Cleansing is, however, aided by a reasonable flow of water.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Water temperature===
Hot water that is comfortable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria. Bacteria grows much faster at body temperature (37 C).  However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water at removing the natural oils on your hands which hold soils and bacteria.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080325225216/www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/a2z-h.html U.S Food and Drug Administration Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition "Handwashing"]</ref> Contrary to popular belief however, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on hands.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Laestadius JG, Dimberg L |title=Hot water for handwashing—where is the proof? |journal=J.

===Solid soap===
Solid [[soap]], because of its reusable nature, may hold bacteria acquired from previous uses.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McBride ME |title=Microbial flora of in-use soap products |journal=Appl.

===Antibacterial soap===
[[Antibacterial soap]]s have been heavily promoted to a health-conscious public.  To date, there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants selects for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weber DJ, Rutala WA |title=Use of germicides in the home and the healthcare setting: is there a relationship between germicide use and antibiotic resistance? |journal=Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=1107–19 |year=2006 |pmid=17006819 |doi=10.1086/507964}}</ref>  However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as [[Triclosan]], which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.  So, even if antibiotic resistant strains aren't selected for by antibacterial soaps, they might not be as effective as they are marketed to be.

A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that plain soaps are as effective as consumer-grade anti-bacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing illness and removing bacteria from the hands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news106418144.html |title=Plain soap as effective as antibacterial but without the risk |accessdate=2007-08-17 |work=}}</ref>

===Hand antiseptic===
A [[hand sanitizer]] or [[hand]] [[antiseptic]] is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/cleanhands/ Clean hands] from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]</ref> In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, [[Hand sanitizer|alcohol rub]] non-water-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.  Most are based on [[isopropyl alcohol]] or [[ethanol]] formulated together with a [[thickening agent]] such as [[Carbomer]] into a gel, or a [[humectant]] such as [[glycerin]] into a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to decrease the drying effect of the [[alcohol]].

Hand sanitizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient germ killers. Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and [[Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus|VRE]]), [[tuberculosis]], and some [[viruses]] (including [[HIV]], [[herpes]], [[Respiratory syncytial virus|RSV]], [[rhinovirus]], [[vaccinia]], [[influenza]],<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.ajic.2011.10.016}}</ref> and [[hepatitis]]) and [[fungus]]. Alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 [[Log reduction]], similar to 35 [[Decibel]] reduction) of the bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4-5 Log reduction) of the bacteria on hands 1 minute after application.<ref name=cvvs>{{cite journal | last = Rotter M.| title = Hand washing and hand disinfection  | journal = Hospital epidemiology and infection control| volume = 87 | year = 1999 }}</ref>

Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus or Norwalk type viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis.

The CDC recommends hand washing over hand sanitizer rubs, particularly when hands are visibly dirty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/ |title=CDC - Handwashing: Clean Hands Save Lives |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=2012-05-11 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref>  The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid killing activity against micro-organisms, however they should not serve as a replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.

Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause [[dry skin]] unless [[emollient]]s and/or skin [[moisturizer]]s are added to the formula. The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding [[glycerin]] and/or other emollients to the formula. In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial [[detergents]]. [[Allergic contact dermatitis]], contact [[urticaria]] syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol hand rubs rarely occur.<ref name="hhforhw"/><ref name="act_safe_as_ag"/> The lower tendency to induce irritant contact dermatitis became an attraction as compared to soap and water hand washing.

Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not cleanse the hands of organic material, but simply disinfect them. It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water at preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens still remain on the hands.

Alcohol-free hand sanitizer [[efficacy]] is heavily dependent on the [[ingredients]] and [[formulation]], and historically has significantly under-performed alcohol and alcohol rubs. More recently, formulations that use [[benzalkonium chloride]] have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application,<ref>Garcia R, Hibbard JS. Antimicrobial activity of a recently approved chlorhexidine isopropyl alcohol antiseptic vs. 70% isopropyl alcohol: a randomized, blind trial. An verbal presentation at the 28th Annual Educational Conference and International Meeting of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, June 12, 2001.</ref> unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in efficacy after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.<ref name="aornjournal.org">{{cite journal |author=Dyer DL, Gerenraich KB, Wadhams PS |title=Testing a new alcohol-free hand sanitizer to combat infection |journal=AORN J |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=239–41, 243–4, 247–51 |year=1998 |month=August |pmid=9706236 |doi=10.1016/S0001-2092(06)62517-9 }}</ref>  Purell has been shown to fail to meet the FDA 21 CFR 333.470 performance standards for health-care personnel antiseptic hand washes, not just as a consequence of the decrease in effectiveness with repeated use, but due to a lack of persistence in antimicrobial activity after application and the decrease in effectiveness with heavy soil loads.<ref name="aornjournal.org"/> In the same study, HandClens was shown to meet and exceed the FDA performance standards.

==Techniques==
===Soap and water===
{{main|Hand washing with soap}}
Conventionally, the use of soap and warm running water and the washing of all surfaces thoroughly, including under fingernails, is seen as necessary. One should rub wet, soapy hands together outside the stream of running water for at least 20 seconds, before rinsing thoroughly and then drying with a clean towel, disposable or otherwise.<ref>One way to ensure children wash their hands for the recommended 20 seconds, is to have the child sing the 'Happy Birthday' song aloud twice while they are washing their hands.[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hand-washing/HQ00407 Hand washing] from [[Mayo Clinic]]</ref>  It has been shown{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} that the use of a disposable towel is a necessary part of effective contaminant removal, since the washing action separates the contaminants from the skin, but does not completely flush them from the skin - removing the excess water (with the towel) also removes the suspended contaminants. After drying, a dry paper towel should be used to turn off the water (and open the exit door if one is in a restroom).  Moisturizing [[lotion]] is often recommended to keep the hands from drying out, should one's hands require washing more than a few times per day.<ref>[http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/about_issue/handwashing.shtml Hand washing] from [[Tufts University]]</ref>

===Hand antiseptics===
Enough hand antiseptic or alcohol rub must be used to thoroughly wet or cover both hands. The front and back of both hands and between and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.

===Drying===
Effective drying of the hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate over the most effective form of drying in washrooms. A growing volume of research suggests paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many washrooms.

In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper-towel industry the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, warm-air hand dryers and the more modern jet-air hand dryers.<ref>[http://www.europeantissue.com/pdfs/090402-2008%20WUS%20Westminster%20University%20hygiene%20study,%20nov2008.pdf A comparative study of three different hand drying methods: paper towel, warm air dryer, jet air dryer’] by Keith Redway and Shameem Fawdar of the School of Biosciences, University of Westminster London</ref>  The key findings were:
* after washing and drying hands with the warm-air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to '''increase''' on average on the finger pads by 194% and on the palms by 254%
* drying with the jet-air dryer resulted in an '''increase''' on average of the total number of bacteria on the finger pads by 42% and on the palms by 15%
* after washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was '''reduced''' on average on the finger pads by up to 76% and on the palms by up to 77%.

The scientists also carried out tests to establish whether there was the potential for cross contamination of other washroom users and the washroom environment as a result of each type of drying method. They found that:

* the jet-air dryer, which blows air out of the unit at claimed speeds of 400&nbsp;mph, was capable of blowing micro-organisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other washroom users and the washroom environment '''up to 2 metres away'''.
* use of a warm-air hand dryer spread micro-organisms '''up to 0.25 metres''' from the dryer.
* paper towels showed '''no significant spread''' of micro-organisms.

In 2005, in a study conducted by TUV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.<ref>TÜV Produkt und Umwelt GmbH Report No. 425-452006 [http://www.europeantissue.com/pdfs/090410%20T%C3%9CV%20-%20Study%20of%20different%20methods%20used%20for%20drying%20hands%20Sept%202005.pdf  A report concerning a study conducted with regard to the different methods used for drying hands; September 2005]</ref> The following changes in the bacterial count after drying the hands were observed:

==Medical use==
[[Image:Hand desinfection test with blood agar plate.jpg|thumb|right|Microbial growth on a cultivation plate without procedures (A), after washing hands with soap (B) and after disinfection with alcohol (C).]]

[[medicine|Medical]] hand-washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Larson EL |title=APIC guideline for handwashing and hand antisepsis in health care settings |journal=Am J Infect Control |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=251–69 |year=1995 |month=August |pmid=7503437 |url=http://www.handhygiene.net/handwashing.html |doi=10.1016/0196-6553(95)90070-5}}</ref> Hands should be rubbed together with digits interlocking. If there is debris under fingernails, a bristle brush may be used to remove it. Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe dry with a clean towel. After drying, the paper towel should be used to turn off the water (and open any exit door if necessary). This avoids re-contaminating the hands from those surfaces.

The purpose of hand-washing in the health-care setting is to remove [[pathogens|pathogenic microorganisms]] ("germs") and avoid transmitting them. The [[New England Journal of Medicine]] reports that a lack of hand-washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with large numbers of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goldmann D |title=System failure versus personal accountability--the case for clean hands |journal=N.

The DebMed® Group Monitoring System (GMS) is an electronic  hand hygiene monitoring system developed from proven scientific research.
It calculates compliance rates based on the WHO (World Health Organization) Five Moments: 
•         before patient care
•         after environmental contact
•         after exposure to blood/body fluids
•         before an aseptic task
•         after patient care
 
The system was designed to monitor groups to encourage team behavior, rather than monitoring and singling out individuals.  It costs 80-90% less than individual badge systems, offering a cost-effective solution with no capital investment. 
 
Developed based on peer-reviewed research, it captures 100 % of hand hygiene events, provides feedback in real-time with a variety of customizable reports. 

The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap ("medicated" or "antimicrobial" soaps) confers killing action to a hand-washing agent. Such killing action may be desired prior to performing surgery or in settings in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent.<ref>[http://www.who.int/patientsafety/events/05/HH_en.pdf WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care]</ref>

To 'scrub' one's hands for a [[surgery|surgical operation]], it is necessary to have a tap that can be turned on and off without touching it with the hands, some [[chlorhexidine]] or [[povidone-iodine|iodine]] wash, sterile towels for drying the hands after washing, and a sterile brush for scrubbing and another sterile instrument for cleaning under the fingernails. All jewelry should be removed. This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.  Long scrub-times (10 minutes) are not necessary. When rinsing, water on the forearms must be prevented from running back to the hands. After hand-washing is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is donned.

Medical hand-washing became mandatory long after [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] physician [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] discovered its effectiveness in preventing disease in a hospital environment.<ref name = "Semmelweis1">{{Cite document

==Hand antiseptics==
[[Image:Unwashed hand.jpg|right|thumb|An example of how minuscule particles can be caught between dermal ridges in the hand, yet remain unseen by the naked eye.]]
Liquid hand antiseptics are much more effective germ killers than gel and foam hand sanitizers. To use in a medical or surgical setting a sterile stainless bowl is filled with antiseptic and both hands are dipped and rinsed in the liquid up to the elbows. The hands and lower arms are removed from the liquid, rubbed and allowed to dry. After, drying in approximately 30 to 60 seconds the healthcare provider is gloved and gowned.

Alcohol rubs and hand antiseptics ([[biocides]]) kill microorganisms. Current scientific evidence has not demonstrated a link between the use of topical antimicrobial formulations and [[antiseptic]] or [[antibiotic]] resistance. Antiseptics (biocides) have multiple (thousands) of nonspecific killing sites on and in the microbial cell which cannot easily mutate. Antibiotics and antibacterial soaps ([[triclosan]]) have one very specific killing site on and in the microbial cell which can easily mutate. Antibiotic resistance has no effect on the effectiveness of antiseptics.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jones RD |title=Bacterial resistance and topical antimicrobial wash products |journal=Am J Infect Control |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=351–63 |year=1999 |pmid=10433675|doi=10.1016/S0196-6553(99)70056-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Barry AL, Fuchs PC, Brown SD |title=Lack of effect of antibiotic resistance on susceptibility of microorganisms to chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone iodine |journal=Eur.

Alcohol rubs and combination hand sanitizers are effective at killing some germs on the hands.<ref name="Alcohol Hand Rub and Hand Hygiene"/> Many clinical studies have shown that alcohol rubs containing two germ killers (i.e., alcohol and [[chlorhexidine gluconate]] or [[benzalkonium chloride]]) are significantly better germ killers than alcohol rubs containing alcohol alone.<ref name="act_safe_as_ag">{{cite journal |author=Hibbard JS |title=Analyses comparing the antimicrobial activity and safety of current antiseptic agents: a review |journal=J Infus Nurs |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=194–207 |year=2005 |pmid=15912075|doi=10.1097/00129804-200505000-00008}}</ref>

However alcohol rub sanitizers are not appropriate for use when the hands are visibly dirty, soiled. Visible soiling of any sort on the hands must be washed with soap and water because alcohol-based hand rubs are less effective in the presence of organic material. In addition, alcohols may not be effective against non-lipid-enveloped viruses (e.g., Noroviruses) as enveloped viruses but they are still effective. Hand antiseptics and soap and water will not kill the endospores of bacteria (e.g., Clostridium difficile and Anthrax) and the spores of protozoa (e.g., Giardia lamblia) but soap and water may wash them down the drain. When such microorganisms are likely to be encountered, soap and water hand washing followed by use of a good hand antiseptic is preferable.<ref name="hhforhw"/>

Hand washing with hand sanitizer (hand antiseptic) is effective in cleaning [killing] staph aureus and the bacteria that are causing these staph infections, but alcohol-based hand sanitizers and soap and water are not effective in killing spore forming organisms because alcohol or soap will not destroy bacterial spores. Washing hands with soap and water may wash the spores down the sink.<ref name="WXTL TV: Hand Sanitizer vs. Washing">{{en}} [http://www.wtxl.com/Global/story.asp?S=7315358 WXTL TV: Hand Sanitizer vs. Washing]</ref>

In the U.S. alcohol rubs have been banned from some schools because of flammability concern. The fire department allows Tallahassee Memorial Hospital to have a certain amount of hand sanitizer per smoke compartment, and supply it up to that limit.<ref name="WXTL TV: Hand Sanitizer vs. Washing"/>

==Hand washing with wipes==
Hand washing using hand sanitizing wipes is also recommended by CDC as a convenient alternative during traveling in the absence of soap and water<ref>{{en}} [http://coldflu.about.com/mbiopage.htm About.com Cold and Flu:Is Hand Sanitizer Better Than Hand Washing?]</ref> in certain health care settings.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Butz AM, Laughon BE, Gullette DL, Larson EL |title=Alcohol-impregnated wipes as an alternative in hand hygiene |journal=Am J Infect Control |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=70–6 |year=1990 |month=April |pmid=2337257 |doi=10.1016/0196-6553(90)90084-6 }}</ref>

==Effectiveness==
This hygienic behavior has been shown to cut the number of child deaths from [[diarrhea]] (the second leading cause of child deaths) by almost half and from [[pneumonia]] (the leading cause of child deaths) by one-quarter.<ref>[http://www.who.int/gpsc/events/2008/Global_Handwashing_Day_Planners_Guide.pdf World Health Organization. Global Handwashing Day 2008: Planner's Guide.]</ref> There are five critical times in washing hands with soap and/or using of a hand antiseptic related to [[fecal-oral transmission]]: after using a bathroom (private or public), after changing a diaper, before feeding a child, before eating and before preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry, or any other situation leading to potential contamination and see below.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/malawi_45225.html Campaign aims to promote hand-washing and save young lives in Malawi]</ref> To reduce the spread of germs, it is also better to wash the hands and/or use a hand antiseptic before and after tending to a sick person.

For control of [[Staphylococcus|staphylococcal]] infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand-cleansing came from the first 20% of washing, and that very little additional benefit was gained when hand cleansing frequency was increased beyond 35%.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Beggs CB, Shepherd SJ, Kerr KG | title=Increasing the frequency of hand washing by healthcare workers does not lead to commensurate reductions in staphylococcal infection in a hospital ward | journal=Bmc Infectious Diseases | volume=8 | year=xxx | page=114  | doi = 10.1186/1471-2334-8-114 | pmc=2553083 | pmid=18764942 }}</ref> Washing with plain soap results in more than triple the rate of bacterial [[infectious disease]] transmitted to food as compared to washing with antibacterial soap.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Fischler GE, Fuls JL, Dail EW, Duran MH, Rodgers ND, Waggoner AL | title=Effect of hand wash agents on controlling the transmission of pathogenic bacteria from hands to food | journal=Journal of Food Production  | volume=70 | issue=12 | year=2007 | pages=2873–2877 | pmid=18095447 }}</ref> Comparing hand-rubbing with alcohol-based solution with handwashing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 seconds each showed that the alcohol hand-rubbing reduced bacterial contamination 26% more than the antibacterial soap.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7360.362 | author=Girou E, Loyeau S, Legrand P, Oppein F, Brun-Buisson C | title=Efficacy of handrubbing with alcohol based solution versus standard handwashing with antiseptic soap: randomised clinical trial | journal=BMJ (Clinical research edition)  | volume=325 | issue=7360 | year=2002 | page=362 | pmid=12183307 | pmc=117885}}</ref>  But soap and water is more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs for reducing [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1 influenza A virus]]<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1086/595845 | author=Grayson ML, Melvani S, Druce J, Barr IG, Ballard SA, Johnson PD, Mastorakos T, Birch C | title=Efficacy of soap and water and alcohol-based hand-rub preparations against live H1N1 influenza virus on the hands of human volunteers | journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases  | volume=48 | issue=3 | year=2009 | pages=285–291 | pmid=19115974 }}</ref> and [[Clostridium difficile]] [[spore]]s from hands.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1086/652772 | author=Jabbar U, Leischner J, Kasper D, Gerber R, Sambol SP, Parada JP, Johnson S, Gerding DN | title=Effectiveness of alcohol-based hand rubs for removal of Clostridium difficile spores from hands | journal=Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology | volume=31 | issue=6 | year=2010 | pages=565–570 | pmid=20429659 }}</ref>

==Religion==
[[Image:Tsukubai2.JPG|Tsukubai|thumb|[[Tsukubai]], provided at a Japanese temple for symbolic hand washing and mouth rinsing]]

In symbolic hand washing using water only to wash hands is a part of [[Ritual purification|ritual handwashing]] as a feature of many religions, including [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Ablution in Judaism|tevilah and netilat yadayim]] in [[Judaism]].  Similar to these are the practices of [[Lavabo]] in [[Christianity]], [[Wudu]] in [[Islam]] and [[Misogi]] in [[Shintō]].

==Handwashing behavior==
The phrase "washing one's hands of" something, means declaring one's unwillingness to take responsibility for the thing or share complicity in it. In the New Testament book of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], verse 27:24 gives an account of [[Pontius Pilate]] washing his hands of the decision to crucify [[Jesus]]:  "When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, 'I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it'."  Also see {{bibleverse||Psalm|26:6}}.

In [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Macbeth]], [[Lady Macbeth (Shakespeare)|Lady Macbeth]] begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse an imagined stain, representing her guilty conscience regarding crimes she had committed and induced her husband to commit.

It has also been found that people, after having recalled or contemplated unethical acts, tend to wash hands more often than others, and tend to value hand washing equipment more. Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such a contemplation are less likely to engage in other "cleansing" compensatory actions, such as volunteering.<ref>{{cite news |author=Benedict Carey |title=Lady Macbeth Not Alone in Her Quest for Spotlessness |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/12/health/psychology/12macbeth.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=12 September 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhong CB, Liljenquist K |title=Washing away your sins: threatened morality and physical cleansing |journal=Science |volume=313 |issue=5792 |pages=1451–2 |year=2006 |pmid=16960010 |doi=10.1126/science.1130726}}<br/>{{cite journal |author=Schnall S, Benton J, Harvey S |title=Clean Conscience: Cleanliness Reduces the Severity of Moral Judgments |journal=Psychological Science |volume=16 |pages=780–4 |year=2005 |pmid=16181440 |issue=10 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01614.x}}</ref>

Excessive hand washing is commonly seen as a symptom of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD).
