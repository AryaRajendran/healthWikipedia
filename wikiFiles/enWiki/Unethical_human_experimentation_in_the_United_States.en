{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2012}}

There have been numerous experiments performed on human test subjects in the United States that have been considered [[medical ethics|unethical]], and were often performed illegally, without the knowledge, [[consent]], or [[informed consent]] of the [[human subject research|test subjects]].

The experiments include: the deliberate infection of people with deadly or debilitating diseases, exposure of people to [[biological weapons|biological]] and [[chemical weapons]], [[human radiation experiments]], injection of people with [[toxic]] and [[radioactive]] chemicals, [[surgical]] experiments, [[interrogation]]/[[torture in the United States|torture]] experiments, tests involving [[mind-altering substances]], and a wide variety of others. Many of these tests were performed on children, the sick, and [[mentally disabled]] individuals, often under the guise of "medical treatment". In many of the studies, a large portion of the subjects were [[poverty|poor]], [[racial minorities]], or [[Incarceration|prisoners]].

Funding for many of the experiments was provided by [[United States government]], especially the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], [[United States military]] and federal or military corporations. The human research programs were usually highly secretive, and in many cases information about them was not released until many years after the studies had been performed.

The ethical, professional, and legal implications of this in the United States medical and scientific community were quite significant, and led to [[Human subject research legislation in the United States|many institutions and policies]] that attempted to ensure that future [[human subject research]] in the United States would be ethical and legal. Public outcry over the discovery of government experiments on human subjects led to numerous congressional investigations and hearings, including the [[Church Committee]], [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]], and [[Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments]], amongst others.

==Surgical experiments==
Throughout the 1840s, [[J. Marion Sims]], who is often referred to as "the father of [[gynecology]]", performed surgical experiments on [[slavery|enslaved]] African women and other poor women, without [[anaesthesia]]. The women regularly died from infections resulting from the experiments.<ref name="tusc-news-lerner">[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&dat=20031030&id=tnQjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cKYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6899,5983547 Some defend 'father of gynecology'] by Barron H. Lerner, ''The Tuscaloosa News'',  October 30, 2003 (Retrieved February 17, 2010)</ref> One of the women was experimented on 30 times. His first operation performed after leaving medical school, was on the infant son of a farm wife. The baby had an infection in his gums and high fever, which Sims had no idea how to treat, so he decided to use whatever tool he had available, which happened to be an icepick. He jabbed the baby's gums with it and left.  The next day he returned to the farm and found that the baby had died.  In order to test one of his theories about the causes of [[trismus]] in infants, Sims performed experiments where he used a shoemaker's [[stitching awl|awl]] to move around the skull bones of the babies of enslaved women.<ref name="med-apartheid-62-63">Washington, 2008: [http://books.google.com/?id=apGhwRt6A7QC&pg=PA63 pp. 62–63]</ref><ref>Cina & Perper, 2010: [http://books.google.com/books?id=eHhtsODHWf0C&pg=PA88 p. 88]</ref>

Later in his career, Dr. Sims found it more lucrative to treat the wives of wealthier men using the same ruthless approach in a more practiced phase.

In 1874, Mary Rafferty, an Irish servant woman, came to Dr. [[Roberts Bartholow]] of the Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati for treatment of her cancer. Seeing a research opportunity, he cut open her head, and inserted needle electrodes into her exposed brain matter.<ref name="lederer-subjected-7-8">Lederer, 1997: [http://books.google.com/?id=6F2lmCfiy8gC&pg=PA7 pp. 7–8]</ref> He described the experiment as follows:

{{blockquote|When the needle entered the brain substance, she complained of acute pain in the neck. In order to develop more decided reactions, the strength of the current was increased ... her countenance exhibited great distress, and she began to cry. Very soon, the left hand was extended as if in the act of taking hold of some object in front of her; the arm presently was agitated with clonic spasm; her eyes became fixed, with pupils widely dilated; lips were blue, and she frothed at the mouth; her breathing became stertorous; she lost consciousness and was violently convulsed on the left side. The convulsion lasted five minutes, and was succeeded by a coma. She returned to consciousness in twenty minutes from the beginning of the attack, and complained of some weakness and vertigo.|Dr. Bartholow's research report<ref name="lederer-subjected-7-8" />}}

In 1896, Dr. Arthur Wentworth performed [[Lumbar puncture|spinal taps]] on 29 young children, without the knowledge or consent of their parents, at the Children's Hospital in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] to discover whether doing so would be harmful.<ref name="grodin-children-7-11">Grodin & Glantz, 1994: [http://books.google.com/?id=HGntiOMBc5sC&pg=PA7 pp. 7–11]</ref>

From 1913 to 1951, Dr. Leo Stanley, chief surgeon at the [[San Quentin Prison]], performed a wide variety of experiments on hundreds of prisoners at San Quentin. Many of the experiments involved testicular implants, where Stanley would take the [[testicles]] out of [[death penalty|executed]] prisoners and surgically implant them into living prisoners. In other experiments, he attempted to implant the testicles of [[sheep|rams]], goats, and [[boars]] into living prisoners. Stanley also performed various [[eugenics]] experiments, and [[forced sterilizations]] on San Quentin prisoners.<ref name="strange-stanley">[http://www.jstor.org/pss/10.1525/phr.2009.78.2.210 The Strange Career of Leo Stanley: Remaking Manhood and Medicine at San Quentin State Penitentiary, 1913–1951], Ethan Blue‌, ''Pacific Historical Review'', May 2009, Vol. 78, No. 2, pp. 210–241, DOI 10.1525/phr.2009.78.2.210</ref> Stanley believed that his experiments would rejuvenate old men, control crime (which he believed had biological causes), and prevent the "unfit" from reproducing.<ref name="strange-stanley" /><ref name="acres-skin-79">Hornblum, 1998: [http://books.google.com/?id=HyFbdu7KKswC&pg=PA79 p. 79]</ref>

==Pathogens, disease, and biological warfare agents==
[[File:Tuskeegee study.jpg|thumb|A subject of the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]] has his blood drawn, c. 1953]]

In the 1880s, in Hawaii, a Californian physician working at a hospital for [[leprosy|lepers]] injected twelve girls under the age of 12 with syphilis.<ref name="grodin-children-7-11"/>

In 1895, the New York [[pediatrician]] Henry Heiman intentionally infected two "idiots" (mentally disabled boys)—one four-year-old and one sixteen-year old—with [[gonorrhea]] as part of a medical experiment. A review of the medical literature of the late 19th and early 20th centuries found that there were more than 40 reports of experimental infections with gonorrheal culture, including some where gonorrheal organisms were applied to the eyes of sick children.<ref name="grodin-children-7-11" /><ref>Lederer, 1997: [http://books.google.com/books?id=6F2lmCfiy8gC&pg=PA3 p. 3]</ref><ref name="responsible-conduct-238-239">Shamoo & Resnick, 2009: [http://books.google.com/?id=v-V2RegJkvEC&pg=PA238 pp. 238–239]</ref>

In 1900{{Verify source|date=December 2010}}, [[U.S Army]] doctors in the [[Philippines]] infected five prisoners with [[bubonic plague]] and induced [[beriberi]] in 29 prisoners; four of the test subjects died as a result.<ref name="germ-war">[http://www.counterpunch.org/germwar.html Germ War: The US Record] – [[Alexander Cockburn]], ''[[CounterPunch|Counterpunch]]''</ref><ref name="p. 89">Cina & Perper, 2010: [http://books.google.com/books?id=eHhtsODHWf0C&pg=PA89 p. 89]</ref> In 1906, Professor Richard Strong of Harvard University intentionally infected 24 Filipino prisoners with [[cholera]], which had somehow become contaminated with plague.

In 1908, three Philadelphia researchers infected dozens of children with [[tuberculin]] at the St. Vincent's House orphanage in Philadelphia, causing permanent blindness in some of the children and painful lesions and inflammation of the eyes in many of the others. In the study they refer to the children as "material used".<ref name="cooter-name-104-105">{{Cite book|title=In the Name of the Child|author=Roger Cooter|publisher=Routledge|year=1992 |isbn=978-0-203-41223-7 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=0HRWtjV4mm0C&pg=PA104&dq=st+vincent%27s+tuberculin&cd=5#v=onepage&q=st%20vincent%27s%20tuberculin|pages=104–105}}</ref>

In 1909, F. C. Knowles released a study describing how he had deliberately infected two children in an orphanage with ''[[Molluscum contagiosum]]'' after an outbreak in the orphanage, in order to study the disease.<ref name="grodin-children-7-11" />

In 1911, Dr. [[Hideyo Noguchi]] of the [[Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research]] injected 146 hospital patients (some of whom were children) with syphilis. He was later sued by the parents of some of the child subjects, who allegedly contracted syphilis as a result of his experiments.<ref>[http://www.annals.org/content/123/2/159.2.full Reviews and Notes: History of Medicine: Subjected to Science: Human Experimentation in America before the Second World War], ''Annals of Internal Medicine'', [[American College of Physicians]], July 15, 1995 vol. 123  no. 2  159</ref>

In 1931 [[Cornelius Rhoads]], also of the Rockefeller Institute, claimed to have injected cancer cells into Puerto Ricans. He later claimed he was joking and was acquitted.

The [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]]<ref name="timeline">{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm |title=Tuskegee Study – Timeline |work=NCHHSTP |publisher=CDC |date=June 25, 2008| accessdate=2008-12-04}}</ref> was a [[clinical trial|clinical study]] conducted between 1932 and 1972 in [[Tuskegee, Alabama]], by the [[U.S. Public Health Service]]. In the experiment, 400 impoverished black males who had syphilis were offered "treatment" by the researchers, who did not tell the test subjects that they had syphilis and did not give them treatment for the disease. By 1947, [[penicillin]] became available as treatment, but those running the study prevented study participants from receiving treatment elsewhere, lying to them about their true condition, so that they could observe the effects of syphilis on the human body. By the end of the study in 1972, only 74 of the test subjects were alive. 28 of the original 399 men had died of syphilis, 100 were dead of related complications, 40 of their wives had been [[sexually transmitted disease|infected]], and 19 of their children were born with [[congenital syphilis]]. The study was not shut down until 1972, when its existence was leaked to the press, forcing the researchers to stop in the face of a public outcry.<ref>[http://www.tuskegee.edu/Global/Story.asp?s=1207586 The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment] Borgna Brunner.

In 1941, at the [[University of Michigan]], doctors Francis and [[Jonas Salk]] and other researchers deliberately infected patients at several Michigan mental institutions with the [[influenza]] virus by spraying the virus into their [[Human nose|nasal]] passages.<ref name="meiklejohn">Meiklejohn, Gordon N., M.D. "Commission on Influenza." in ''Histories' of the Commissions'' Ed.

{{blockquote|"It may save you much trouble if you publish your paper ... elsewhere than in the ''Journal of Experimental Medicine''.

In 1941 Dr. William C. Black [[inoculation|inoculated]] a twelve month old baby "offered as a volunteer" with [[herpes]].  He submitted his research to ''The Journal of Experimental Medicine'' and it was rejected on ethical grounds. The editor of the ''Journal of Experimental Medicine'', Francis Payton Rous, called the experiment "an abuse of power, an infringement of the rights of an individual, and not excusable because the illness which followed had implications for science."<ref name="grodin-children-14">Grodin & Glantz, 1994: [http://books.google.com/?id=HGntiOMBc5sC&pg=PA14 p. 14]</ref><ref>Brody, 1998: [http://books.google.com/books?id=mERfunMVv_oC&pg=PA120 p. 120]</ref><ref>Cina & Perper, 2010: [http://books.google.com/books?id=eHhtsODHWf0C&pg=PA94 p. 94]</ref> It was later published in the ''Journal of Pediatrics''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Black WC |title=The etiology of acute infectious gingivostomatitis (Vincent's stomatitis) |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=145–60 |year=1942 |month=February |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(42)80125-0}}</ref>

The [[Stateville Penitentiary Malaria Study]] was the site of a controlled study of the effects of [[malaria]] on the prisoners of [[Stateville Correctional Center|Stateville Penitentiary]] near Joliet, Illinois beginning in the 1940s. The study was conducted by the Department of Medicine at the University of Chicago in conjunction with the United States Army and the State Department. At the [[Nuremberg trials]], Nazi doctors cited the malaria experiments as part of their defense.<ref>[[George Annas]] & [[Michael Grodin]], 1995: [http://books.google.com/books?id=4P04DuPIfAYC&pg=PA267 p. 267]</ref><ref>Hornblum, 1999: [http://books.google.com/books?id=NGCLMQF85SkC&pg=PA76 p. 76]</ref> The study continued at Stateville Penitentiary for 29 years.  In related studies from 1944 to 1946, Dr. Alf Alving, a professor at the [[University of Chicago]] Medical School, purposely infected psychiatric patients at the Illinois State Hospital with [[malaria]], so that he could test experimental malaria treatments on them.<ref>Rothman, 1992: [http://books.google.com/?id=78dvvyqgi7MC&pg=PA36 p.36]</ref>

In a 1946 to 1948 [[Guatemala syphilis experiment|study in Guatemala]], U.S. researchers used prostitutes to infect prison inmates, insane asylum patients, and Guatemalan soldiers with syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases, in order to test the effectiveness of penicillin in treating sexually transmitted diseases. They later tried infecting people with "direct inoculations made from syphilis bacteria poured into the men's [[penises]] and on forearms and faces that were slightly abraded . . . or in a few cases through spinal punctures". Approximately 700 people were infected as part of the study (including [[orphan]] children). The study was sponsored by the Public Health Service, the National Institutes of Health and the Pan American Health Sanitary Bureau (now the [[World Health Organization]]'s Pan American Health Organization) and the Guatemalan government. The team was led by [[John Charles Cutler]], who later participated in the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiments]]. Cutler chose to do the study in Guatemala because he would not have been permitted to do it in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. sorry for Guatemala syphilis experiment|work=CBC News|date=October 1, 2010|url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2010/10/01/syphilis-guatemala.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. apologizes for newly revealed syphilis experiments done in Guatemala|author=Rob Stein|work=The Washington Post|date=October 1, 2010|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/01/AR2010100104457.html?hpid=topnews}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=US sorry over deliberate sex infections in Guatemala |publisher=BBC News|date=October 1, 2010|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11454789}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=US says sorry for 'outrageous and abhorrent' Guatemalan syphilis tests|author=Chris McGreal|work=The Guardian|date=October 1, 2010|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/01/us-apology-guatemala-syphilis-tests|location=London}}</ref>

In 1950, in order to conduct a simulation of a biological warfare attack, the U.S. Navy used airplanes to spray large quantities of the bacteria ''[[Serratia marcescens]]'' – considered harmless at this time – over the city of San Francisco, which caused numerous citizens to contract pneumonia-like illnesses, and killed at least one person.<ref name="undue-risk-233-234">Moreno, 2001: [http://books.google.com/?id=ZhMiN64D96cC&pg=PA233 pp. 233–234]</ref><ref name="rogue-state-147-149">{{Cite book|last=Blum|first=William|title=Rogue state: a guide to the world's only superpower|publisher=Zed Books|year=2006|pages=147–149|isbn=978-1-84277-827-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=oBM8UiDYz1MC&pg=PA150&lpg=PA147&dq=%22whooping+cough%22+CIA+tampa+1955&q=%22whooping%20cough%22%20CIA%20tampa%201955}}</ref><ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/2005/7/13/how_the_u_s_government_exposed "How the U.S. Government Exposed Thousands of Americans to Lethal Bacteria to Test Biological Warfare"], ''Democracy Now!'', July 13, 2005</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The American West at risk: science, myths, and politics of land abuse and recovery|authors=Howard Gordon Wilshire, Jane E.

==Human radiation experiments==
Researchers in the United States have performed thousands of [[human radiation experiments]] to determine the effects of [[atomic radiation]] and [[radioactive contamination]] on the human body, generally on people who were poor, sick, or powerless.<ref name="textbook-research-ethics-19-23">Loue, 2000: [http://books.google.com/?id=Hizb9k7W57MC&pg=PA19 pp. 19–23]</ref> Most of these tests were performed, funded, or supervised by the [[United States military]], [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], or various other [[US federal government]] agencies.

The experiments included a wide array of studies, involving things like feeding radioactive food to mentally disabled children or [[conscientious objectors]], inserting [[radium]] rods into the noses of schoolchildren, deliberately releasing radioactive chemicals over U.S. and Canadian cities, measuring the health effects of radioactive fallout from nuclear bomb tests, injecting pregnant women and babies with radioactive chemicals, and irradiating the testicles of prison inmates, amongst other things.

Much information about these programs was [[classified information|classified]] and kept secret.

===Radioactive iodine experiments===
In 1953, the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) ran several studies on the health effects of radioactive iodine in newborns and pregnant women at the [[University of Iowa]]. In one study, researchers gave pregnant women from {{convert|100|to|200|µCi|MBq|lk=on}} of iodine-131, in order to study the women's [[miscarriage|aborted embryos]] in an attempt to discover at what stage, and to what extent, radioactive iodine crosses the [[placental]] barrier. In another study, they gave 25 newborn babies (who were under 36 hours old and weighed from {{convert|5.5|to|8.5|lbs|kg}}) iodine-131, either by oral administration or through an injection, so that they could measure the amount of iodine in their thyroid glands.<ref name="goliszek-132-134" />

In another AEC study, researchers at the [[University of Nebraska College of Medicine]] fed iodine-131 to 28 healthy infants through a gastric tube to test the concentration of iodine in the infants' thyroid glands.<ref name="goliszek-132-134">Goliszek, 2003: pp. 132–134</ref>

In a 1949 operation called the "[[Green Run]]," the AEC released iodine-131 and [[xenon-133]] to the atmosphere which contaminated a {{convert|500000|acre|km2|adj=on}} area containing three small towns near the [[Hanford site]] in Washington.<ref name="goliszek-130-131">Goliszek, 2003: pp. 130–131</ref>

In 1953, the AEC sponsored a study to discover if radioactive iodine affected [[premature birth|premature]] babies differently from full-term babies. In the experiment, researchers from Harper Hospital in Detroit orally administered iodine-131 to 65 premature and full-term infants who weighed from {{convert|2.1|to|5.5|lbs|kg}}.<ref name="goliszek-132-134" />

From 1955 to 1960 [[Sonoma State Hospital]] in northern California served as a permanent drop off location for mentally handicapped children diagnosed with cerebral palsy or lesser disorders. The children subsequently underwent painful experimentation without adult consent. Many were given irradiated milk, some spinal taps "for which they received no direct benefit." 60 Minutes Wednesday learned that in these fifteen years, the brain of every cerebral palsy child who died at Sonoma State was removed and studied without parental consent. According to the CBS story, over 1,400 patients died at the clinic.<ref>Rebecca Leung. "[http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500164_162-672701.html A Dark Chapter In Medical History]". CBS News, February 11, 2009.</ref>

In 1962, the Hanford site again released I-131, stationing test subjects along its path to record its effect on them. The AEC also recruited Hanford volunteers to ingest milk contaminated with I-131 during this time.<ref name="goliszek-132-134" />

===Thorium and radium===

The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] funded the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to administer [[radium-224]] and [[thorium-234]] to 20 people between 1961 and 1965. Many were chosen from the Age Center of New England and had volunteered for "research projects on aging". Doses were {{convert|0.2|-|2.4|µCi|kBq}} for radium and {{convert|1.2|-|120|µCi|kBq}} for thorium.<ref name="congress86" />

===Polonium experiments ===

The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] and the [[Manhattan Project]] funded the administration of [[polonium]] to 5 people at the University of Rochester between 1943 and 1947.

===Experiments involving other radioactive materials===
Immediately after World War II, researchers at [[Vanderbilt University]] gave 829 pregnant mothers in Tennessee what they were told were "vitamin drinks" that would improve the health of their babies, but were, in fact, mixtures containing radioactive iron, to determine how fast the radioisotope crossed into the [[placenta]].

From 1946 to 1953, at the [[Walter E. Fernald State School]] in  Massachusetts, in an experiment sponsored by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and the [[Quaker Oats]] corporation, 73 mentally disabled children were fed [[oatmeal]] containing radioactive [[calcium]] and other [[radionuclide|radioisotope]]s, in order to track "how nutrients were digested". The children were not told that they were being fed radioactive chemicals and were told by hospital staff and researchers that they were joining a "science club".<ref name="lebaron-97-98">{{Cite book|last=LeBaron|first=Wayne D.|title=America's nuclear legacy|publisher=Nova Publishers|year=1998|pages=97–98|isbn=978-1-56072-556-5|url=http://books.google.com/?id=cr81ZHY-6H0C&pg=PA97&dq=human+radiation+experiments&cd=2#v=onepage&q=human%20radiation%20experiments}}</ref><ref name="goliszek-139">Goliszek, 2003: p. 139</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/04/29/60minutes/main614728.shtml | accessdate = February 18, 2010 | work=CBS News | title=America's Deep, Dark Secret | date=April 29, 2004}}</ref><ref name=" Task Force Reports on Fernald Studies">{{Cite book|title=The Tech online edition |author= Abhilash R.

In the 1950s, researchers at the Medical College of Virginia performed experiments on severe burn victims, most of them poor and black, without their knowledge or consent, with funding from the Army and in collaboration with the AEC. In the experiments, the subjects were exposed to additional burning, experimental antibiotic treatment, and injections of radioactive isotopes. The amount of radioactive [[phosphorus-32]] injected into some of the patients, {{convert|500|µCi|MBq}}, was 50 times the "acceptable" dose for a ''healthy'' individual; for people with severe burns, this likely led to significantly increased death rates.<ref>[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/radiation/dir/mstreet/commeet/meet11/trnsc11a.txt "Transcript – February 15, 1995"], ''Eleventh Meeting, February 19–20, 1995 – Washington D.C.'', [[Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments]] (Retrieved February 19, 2010) – see testimony of Honicker</ref><ref name="man-med-state-263">Eckart, 2006: [http://books.google.com/?id=VIEDR5XLrWsC&pg=PA263&lpg=PA263 p. 263]</ref>

In another study at the Walter E. Fernald State School, in 1956, researchers gave mentally disabled children radioactive calcium orally and intravenously. They also injected radioactive chemicals into malnourished babies and then pushed needles through their skulls, into their brains, through their necks, and into their spines to collect [[cerebrospinal fluid]] for analysis.<ref name=" Task Force Reports on Fernald Studies" /><ref name="goliszek-253">Goliszek, 2003: p. 253</ref>

===Fallout research===
[[File:Project 4.1 final report cover.png|thumb|Cover of the final report of [[Project 4.1]], which examined the effects of [[radioactive fallout]] on the natives of the [[Marshall Islands]]]]

In 1954, American scientists conducted [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] exposure research on the citizens of the [[Marshall Islands]] after they were inadvertently irradiated<ref>{{cite web|title=Operation Castle|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Castle.html|work=Operation Castle|accessdate=June 11, 2011}}</ref> by the [[Castle Bravo]] [[nuclear test]] in [[Project 4.1]].  The Bravo test was detonated upwind of [[Rongelap Atoll]] and the residents were exposed to serious radiation levels, up to 180 rads (1.8&nbsp;Gy). Of the 236 Marshallese exposed, some developed severe [[radiation sickness]] and one died, and long term effects included birth defects, "jellyfish" babies, and thyroid problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rmiembassyus.org/Nuclear%20Issues.htm |title=Nuclear Issues |publisher=Rmiembassyus.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-16}}</ref>

In 1957, atmospheric nuclear explosions in Nevada, which were part of [[Operation Plumbbob]] were later determined to have released enough radiation to have caused from 11,000 to 212,000 excess cases of [[thyroid cancer]] amongst U.S. citizens who were exposed to [[fallout]] from the explosions, leading to between 1,100 and 21,000 deaths.<ref name="plumbbob-thyroid-cancer-nci">{{Cite book|title=Exposure of the American people to Iodine-131 from Nevada nuclear-bomb tests: review of the National Cancer Institute report and public health implications|editor=Institute of Medicine (U.S.).

Early in the [[Cold War]], in studies known as [[Project GABRIEL]] and [[Project SUNSHINE]], researchers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia attempted to determine just how much nuclear fallout would be required to make the Earth uninhabitable.<ref>[http://www.hss.energy.gov/healthsafety/ohre/roadmap/achre/intro_7.html ''ACHRE Report:New Ethical Questions for Medical Researchers'']<br>"In 1949, the AEC undertook Project GABRIEL, a secret effort to study the question of whether the tests could threaten the viability of life on earth.

Such tests had dispersed [[radioactive contamination]] worldwide, and examination of human bodies could reveal how readily it was taken up and hence how much damage it caused.  Of particular interest was [[strontium]]-90 in the bones.  Infants were the primary focus, as they would have had a full opportunity to absorb the new contaminants.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4197264,00.html | location=London |work=The Guardian | first=Eddie | last=Goncalves | title=Britain snatched babies' bodies for nuclear labs | date=June 3, 2001}}</ref>

As a result of this conclusion, researchers began a program to collect human bodies and bones from all over the world, with a particular focus on infants.  The bones were cremated and the ashes analyzed for radioisotopes.  This project was kept secret primarily because it would be a [[public relations]] disaster; as a result parents and family were not told what was being done with the body parts of their relatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/scotorgrev/Documents/Project%20Sunshine%20%20slippery%20slope.pdf |title=Dundee University Medical School; PDF |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-12-16}}</ref>

===Irradiation experiments===
Between 1960 and 1971, the Department of Defense funded non-consensual [[whole body radiation]] experiments on poor, black cancer patients, who were not told what was being done to them. Patients were told that they were receiving a "treatment" that might cure their cancer, but in reality the Pentagon was attempting to determine the effects of high levels of radiation on the human body. One of the doctors involved in the experiments, Robert Stone, was worried about [[litigation]] by the patients, so he only referred to them by their initials on the medical reports. He did this so that, in his words, "there will be no means by which the patients can ever connect themselves up with the report", in order to prevent "either adverse publicity or litigation".<ref name="lebaron-99-100">{{Cite book|last=LeBaron|first=Wayne D.|title=America's nuclear legacy|publisher=Nova Publishers|year=1998|pages=99–100|isbn=978-1-56072-556-5|url=http://books.google.com/?id=cr81ZHY-6H0C&pg=PA99&dq=human+radiation+experiments&cd=2#v=onepage&q=human%20radiation%20experiments}}</ref>

From 1960 to 1971, [[Dr. Eugene Saenger]], funded by the Defense Atomic Support Agency, performed whole body radiation experiments on more than 90 poor, black, terminally ill cancer patients with inoperable tumors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. He forged consent forms, and did not inform them of the risks of irradiation. The patients were given 100 or more rads (1&nbsp;Gy) of whole-body radiation, which in many caused intense pain and vomiting. Critics have questioned the medical rationale for this study, and contend that the main purpose of the research was to study the acute effects of radiation exposure.<ref name="saenger">Thomas H.

In return for their participation, he gave them $5 a month, and $100 when they had to receive a [[vasectomy]] upon conclusion of the trial. The surgeon who sterilized the men said that it was necessary to "keep from contaminating the general population with radiation-induced [[mutant]]s".

To test whether or not [[sulfuric acid]], which is used in making [[molasses]], was harmful as a food additive, the Louisiana State Board of Health commissioned a study to feed "Negro prisoners" nothing but molasses for five weeks.

[[File:Chloracne-in-herbicide-worker.gif|thumb|[[Chloracne]] resulting from exposure to [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], such as those that Albert Kligman injected into prisoners at the [[Holmesburg Prison]]]]

From approximately 1951 to 1974, the [[Holmesburg Prison]] in [[Pennsylvania]] was the site of extensive [[dermatological]] research operations, using prisoners as subjects. Led by Dr. Albert M. Kligman of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], the studies were performed on behalf of [[Dow Chemical Company]], the U.S. Army, and [[Johnson & Johnson]].<ref>Hornblum, 1998: [http://books.google.com/books?id=NGCLMQF85SkC&pg=PA216 p. 216]</ref><ref>Cina & Perper, 2010: [http://books.google.com/books?id=WWJUGMh2OhcC&pg=PA92 pp. 92–93]</ref><ref>Washington, 2008: [http://books.google.com/books?id=apGhwRt6A7QC&pg=PA249 pp. 249–262]</ref> In one of the studies, for which Dow Chemical paid Kligman $10,000, Kligman injected [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] — a highly toxic, [[carcinogenic]] compound found in [[Agent Orange]], which Dow was manufacturing for use in Vietnam at the time — into 70 prisoners (most of them black). The prisoners developed severe lesions which went untreated for seven months.<ref name="germ-war" /> Dow Chemical wanted to study the health effects of dioxin and other [[herbicides]], and how they affect human skin, because workers at their chemical plants were developing [[chloracne]]. In the study, Kligman applied roughly the amount of dioxin Dow employees were being exposed to. In 1980 and 1981, some of the people who were used in this study sued Professor Kligman for a variety of health problems, including [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]] and psychological damage.<ref name="kaye-wrinkled">Kaye, Jonathan. "Retin-A's Wrinkled Past", ''Pennsylvania History Review'', Spring 1997.</ref>

Kligman later continued his dioxin studies, increasing the dosage of dioxin he applied to 10 prisoners' skin to 7,500 micrograms of dioxin, which is 468 times the dosage that the Dow Chemical official Gerald K. Rowe had authorized him to administer. As a result, the prisoners developed inflammatory [[pustules]] and [[papules]].<ref name="kaye-wrinkled" />

The Holmesburg program also paid hundreds of inmates a nominal stipend to test a wide range of cosmetic products and chemical compounds, whose health effects were unknown at the time.<ref name="acres-320">Hornblum, 1998: [http://books.google.com/?id=HyFbdu7KKswC&pg=PA320 p. 320]</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title = Ex-Inmates Sue Penn and Kligman over Research |newspaper = The Pennsylvania Gazette|publisher = [[The University of Pennsylvania]] |date = January/February 2001| url = http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0101/0101gaz3.html |accessdate = November 9, 2009}}</ref> Upon his arrival at Holmesberg, Kligman is claimed to have said "All I saw before me were acres of skin ...

In 1967, the U.S. Army paid Kligman to apply skin-blistering chemicals to the faces and backs of inmates at Holmesburg to, in Kligman's words, "learn how the skin protects itself against chronic assault from toxic chemicals, the so-called hardening process."<ref name="kaye-wrinkled" />

==Psychological and torture experiments==

===U.S. government research===
The United States government funded and performed numerous psychological experiments, especially during the Cold War era. Many of these experiments were performed to help develop more effective [[torture]] and [[interrogation]] techniques for the U.S. military and intelligence agencies, and to develop techniques for resisting torture at the hands of enemy nations and organizations.

In studies running from 1947 to 1953, which were known as [[Project Chatter]], the U.S. Navy began identifying and testing [[truth serums]], which they hoped could be used during interrogations of Soviet spies. Some of the chemicals tested on human subjects included [[mescaline]] and the [[anticholinergic]] drug [[scopolamine]].<ref name="goliszek-152-154">Goliszek, 2003: pp. 152–154</ref>

Shortly thereafter, in 1950, the CIA initiated [[Project Bluebird]], later renamed [[Project Artichoke]], whose stated purpose was to develop "the means to control individuals through special interrogation techniques", "way<nowiki>[s]</nowiki> to prevent the extraction of information from CIA agents", and "offensive uses of unconventional techniques, such as hypnosis and drugs".<ref name="goliszek-152-154" /><ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Evans |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB54/ |title=Science, Technology and the CIA |publisher=Gwu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-16}}</ref><ref>''Church Committee''; [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/book1/html/ChurchB1_0199b.htm p. 390] "MKULTRA was approved by the DCI <nowiki>[</nowiki>Director of Central Intelligence] on April 13, 1953"</ref> The purpose of the project was outlined in a memo dated January 1952 that stated, "Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature, such as self preservation?"

In 1952, professional tennis player [[Harold Blauer]] died when injected with a fatal dose of a mescaline derivative at the New York State Psychiatric Institute of [[Columbia University]], by Dr. James Cattell. The [[United States Department of Defense]], which sponsored the injection, worked in collusion with the Department of Justice, and the New York State Attorney General to conceal evidence of its involvement for 23 years.

In 1953, the CIA placed several of its interrogation and mind-control programs under the direction of a single program, known by the code name [[MKULTRA]], after CIA director [[Allen Dulles]] complained about not having enough "human guinea pigs to try these extraordinary techniques".<ref name="question-torture-28-30">McCoy, 2006: [http://books.google.com/?id=-sa-nUI3HGMC&pg=PA28 pp. 28–30]</ref> The MKULTRA project was under the direct command of [[Dr. Sidney Gottlieb]] of the [[Technical Services Division]].<ref name="question-torture-28-30" /> The project received over $25 million, and involved hundreds of experiments on human subjects at eighty different institutions.

In a memo describing the purpose of one MKULTRA program subprogram, Richard Helms said:
{{blockquote|We intend to investigate the development of a chemical material which causes a reversible, nontoxic aberrant mental state, the specific nature of which can be reasonably well predicted for each individual. This material could potentially aid in discrediting individuals, eliciting information, and implanting suggestions and other forms of mental control.|Richard Helms, internal CIA memo<ref name="goliszek-155">Goliszek, 2003: [http://books.google.com/books?id=jzbcSdD9RG4C&pg=155 p. 155]</ref>}}

In 1954, the CIA's Project QKHILLTOP was created to study Chinese [[brainwashing]] techniques, and to develop effective methods of interrogation. Most of the early studies are believed to have been performed by the [[Cornell University]] Medical School's human ecology study programs, under the direction of Dr. Harold Wolff.<ref name="goliszek-152-154" /><ref>[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1950/mkultra/AppendixC.htm APPENDIX C: Documents Referring To Subprojects] – ''1977 Senate MKULTRA Hearing'' (Retrieved February 18, 2010)</ref><ref name="american-torture-24-25">Otterman, 2007: [http://books.google.com/?id=wiVqrgS68NoC&pg=PA24 pp. 24–25]</ref> Wolff requested that the CIA provide him any information they could find regarding "threats, coercion, imprisonment, deprivation, humiliation, torture, 'brainwashing', 'black psychiatry', and hypnosis, or any combination of these, with or without chemical agents". According to Wolff, the research team would then:
{{blockquote|...assemble, collate, analyze and assimilate this information and will then undertake experimental investigations designed to develop new techniques of offensive/defensive intelligence use ...

Another of the MKULTRA subprojects, [[Operation Midnight Climax]], consisted of a web of CIA-run safehouses in San Francisco, Marin, and New York which were established in order to study the effects of LSD on unconsenting individuals. Prostitutes on the CIA payroll were instructed to lure clients back to the safehouses, where they were surreptitiously plied with a wide range of substances, including LSD, and monitored behind one-way glass. Several significant operational techniques were developed in this theater, including extensive research into sexual blackmail, surveillance technology, and the possible use of mind-altering drugs in field operations.<ref name="whiteout-206-209">{{Cite book|last=Cockburn|first=Alexander|coauthors=Jeffrey St. Clair|title=Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs and the Press|publisher=Verso|location=New York|year=1998|pages=206–209|isbn=1-85984-258-5}}</ref>

In 1957, with funding from a CIA front organization, [[Dr. Ewan Cameron]] of the [[Allan Memorial Institute]] in [[Montreal, Canada]] began MKULTRA Subproject 68.<ref name="american-torture-45-47">Otterman, 2007: [http://books.google.com/?id=wiVqrgS68NoC&pg=PA45 pp. 45–47]</ref> His experiments were designed to first "depattern" individuals, erasing their minds and memories—reducing them to the mental level of an infant—and then to "rebuild" their personality in a manner of his choosing.<ref name="shock-doc-ch1" /> To achieve this, Cameron placed patients under his "care" into drug-induced comas for up to 88 days, and applied numerous high voltage electric shocks to them over the course of weeks or months, often administering up to 360 shocks per person. He would then perform what he called "psychic driving" experiments on the subjects, where he would repetitively play recorded statements, such as "You are a good wife and mother and people enjoy your company", through speakers he had implanted into blacked-out football helmets that he bound to the heads of the test subjects (for [[sensory deprivation]] purposes). The patients could do nothing but listen to these messages, played for 16–20 hours a day, for weeks at a time. In one case, Cameron forced a person to listen to a message non-stop for 101 days.<ref name="shock-doc-ch1" /> Using CIA funding, Cameron converted the horse [[stables]] behind Allen Memorial into an elaborate isolation and sensory deprivation chamber which he kept patients locked in for weeks at a time.<ref name="shock-doc-ch1" /> Cameron also induced [[insulin]] comas in his subjects by giving them large injections of insulin, twice a day for up to two months at a time.<ref name="goliszek-152-154"/> Several of the children who Cameron experimented on were sexually abused, in at least one case by several men. One of the children was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments.<ref name="goliszek-170-171">Goliszek, 2003: pp. 170–171</ref>

The Tulane Electrical Brain Stimulation Program.
Starting in the early 1950s, Dr. Robert Heath of [[Tulane University]] performed experiments on various mentally ill patients, most of whom had [[schizophrenia]] . The experiments were funded by the U.S. Army. The program implanted electrodes deep into the patients brains to electrically stimulate and take recordings. In addition to the deep brain electrodes, cannulas were surgically placed to allow injections, a direct chemical stimulation of the brain. In some of the studies, he dosed the patients with LSD, mescaline, acetylcholine, and/or norepinephrine.  In the early 1970s the Tulane program began to be criticized when homosexuality was no longer considered a mental illness.<ref name="Journal of the History of the Neurosciences">{{cite journal|last=Baumeister|first=Alan A.|title=The Tulane Electrical Brain Stimulation Program.

MKULTRA activities continued until 1973 when CIA director [[Richard Helms]], fearing that they would be exposed to the public, ordered the project terminated, and all of the files destroyed.<ref name="question-torture-28-30" /> However, a clerical error had sent many of the documents to the wrong office, so when CIA workers were destroying the files, some of them remained, and were later released under a [[Freedom of Information Act]] request by [[investigative journalist]] John Marks. Many people in the American public were outraged when they learned of the experiments, and several congressional investigations took place including the [[Church Committee]] and the [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]].

On April 26, 1976, the [[Church Committee]] of the United States Senate issued a report, "Final Report of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operation with Respect to Intelligence Activities",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/finalreportofsel01unit#page/390/mode/2up |title=Final report of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, United States Senate : together with additional, supplemental, and separate views |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-16}}</ref> In Book I, Chapter XVII, p 389 this report states:

:LSD was one the materials tested in the MKULTRA program.  The final phase of LSD testing involved surreptitious administration to unwitting non-volunteer subjects in normal life settings by undercover officers of the Bureau of Narcotics acting for the CIA.

: A special procedure, designated MKDELTA, was established to govern the use of [[Project MKULTRA|MKULTRA]] materials abroad. Such materials were used on a number of occasions. Because MKULTRA records were destroyed, it is impossible to reconstruct the operational use of MKULTRA materials by the CIA overseas; it has been determined that the use of these materials abroad began in 1953, and possibly as early as 1950.<ref name="Estabrooks1971">Estabrooks, G.H.

In 1963, CIA had synthesized many of the findings from its psychological research into what became known as the [[KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation]] handbook,<ref name="question-torture-50-53">McCoy, 2006: [http://books.google.com/?id=-sa-nUI3HGMC&pg=PA50 pp. 50–53]</ref> which cited the MKULTRA studies and other secret research programs as the scientific basis for their interrogation methods.<ref name="shock-doc-ch1">{{Cite book|author=[[Naomi Klein]]|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Pse7S3Q8YYQC&lpg=PA25&dq=ewen%20cameron&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q=ewen%20cameron|title=The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism|publisher=Metropolitan Books|location=New York|year=2007|chapter=1|isbn=0-8050-7983-1}}</ref> Cameron regularly traveled around the U.S. teaching military personnel about his techniques (hooding of prisoners for sensory deprivation, prolonged isolation, humiliation, etc.), and how they could be used in interrogations. Latin American paramilitary groups working for the CIA and U.S. military received training in these psychological techniques at places like the [[School of the Americas]], and even today, many of the torture techniques developed in the [[MKULTRA]] studies and other programs are being used at U.S. military and CIA prisons such as [[Guantanamo Bay]] and [[Abu Ghraib]].<ref name="shock-doc-ch1" /><ref name="us-hist-torture">[http://www.zcommunications.org/u-s-has-a-history-of-using-torture-by-alfred-w-mccoy U.S. Has a History of Using Torture] – Alfred W.

This propagated the image that CIA researchers were, as one author put it "a bunch of bumbling sci-fi buffoons", rather than a rational group of men who had run torture laboratories and medical experiments in major U.S. universities, and who had tortured, raped, and psychologically abused young children, driving many of them permanently insane.<ref name="shock-doc-ch1" />

From 1964 to 1968, the U.S. Army paid $386,486 to professors Albert Kligman and Herbert W. Copelan to perform experiments with mind-altering drugs on 320 inmates of [[Holmesburg Prison]]. The goal of the study was to determine the minimum effective dose of each drug needed to disable 50 percent of any given population. Kligman and Copelan initially claimed that they were unaware of any long-term health effects the drugs could have on prisoners, however, documents later revealed that this was not the case.<ref name="kaye-wrinkled" />

Medical professionals gathered and collected data on the CIA’s use of [[torture]] techniques on detainees, in order to refine those techniques, and to "to provide legal cover for torture, as well as to help justify and shape future procedures and policies", according to a report by [[Physicians for Human Rights]]. The report stated that: “Research and medical experimentation on detainees was used to measure the effects of large-volume waterboarding and adjust the procedure according to the results.” As a result of the waterboarding experiments, doctors recommended adding [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] to the water “to prevent putting detainees in a coma or killing them through over-ingestion of large amounts of plain water.” Sleep deprivation tests were performed on over a dozen prisoners, in 48-, 96- and 180-hour increments. Doctors also collected data intended to help them judge the emotional and physical impact of the techniques so as to “calibrate the level of pain experienced by detainees during interrogation" and to determine if using certain types of techniques would increase a subject's "susceptibility to severe pain.". The CIA denied the allegations, claiming they never performed any experiments, and saying "The report is just wrong"; however, the U.S. government never investigated the claims.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Sheldon Richman|title=Did the CIA Conduct Medical Experiments on Detainees?|work=Counterpunch|date=June 23, 2010|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/richman06232010.html}}</ref><ref>[http://phrtorturepapers.org/?dl_id=9 Experiments in Torture: Human Subject Research and Experimentation in the “Enhanced” Interrogation Program], ''Physicians for Human Rights'', June 2010<br />See also:<br />*[http://phrtorturepapers.org/?page_id=614 Related Publications]<br />*[http://phrtorturepapers.org/?page_id=569 Outside Academic Experts Respond to Experiments in Torture]<br />*[http://phrtorturepapers.org/?p=430 Complaint to Office of Human Research Protections Regarding Evidence of CIA Violations of Common Rule]<br />*[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5rNQOAEM6U Experiments in Torture (video)]</ref><ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/2010/6/8/experiments_in_torture_medical_group_accuses Experiments in Torture: Medical Group Accuses CIA of Carrying Out Illegal Human Experimentation], ''Democracy Now!'', June 8, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2aYvLfLIos Accounting for Torture: Being Faithful to our Values], (video) ''National Religious Campaign Against Torture'' (cited by PHR)</ref><ref>{{Cite news|work=The New York Times|date=June 6, 2010|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/world/07doctors.html|title=Medical Ethics Lapses Cited in Interrogations | first=James | last=Risen}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/media/doc/2010/04/22/icrc-report.pdf ICRC Report on the Treatment of Fourteen “High Value Detainees” in CIA Custody], ''International Committee of the Red Cross'', February 14, 2007</ref>

===Academic research===
In 1939, at the Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home in [[Davenport, Iowa]], twenty-two children were the subjects of the so-called [[The Monster Study|"monster" experiment]]. This experiment attempted to use psychological abuse to induce stuttering in children who spoke normally.

In 1961, in response to the [[Nuremberg Trials]], the [[Yale]] [[psychologist]] [[Stanley Milgram]] performed his "Obedience to Authority Study", also known as the [[Milgram Experiment]], in order to determine if it was possible that the Nazi genocide could have resulted from millions of people who were "just following orders". The Milgram Experiment raised questions about the ethics of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress suffered by the participants, who were told, as part of the experiment, to apply electric shocks to test subjects (who were actually actors not really receiving [[electroshock|electric shocks]]).

==Pharmacological research==
At Harvard University, in the late 1940s, researchers began performing experiments where they tested [[diethylstilbestrol]], a synthetic [[estrogen]], on pregnant women at the Lying-In Hospital of the University of Chicago. The women experienced an abnormally high number of miscarriages and babies with low birth weight. None of the women were told that they were being experimented on.<ref name="textbook-research-ethics-30">Loue, 2000: [http://books.google.com/?id=Hizb9k7W57MC&pg=PA30 p. 30]</ref>

From 1988 to 2008, the number of overseas clinical trials for drugs intended for American consumption increased by 2,000%, to approximately 6,500 trials. These trials are often conducted in areas with large numbers of poor and illiterate people who grant their consent by signing an "X" or making a thumb print on a form. These tests are rarely monitored by the FDA, and have in some cases proved deadly, such as a case where 49 babies died in [[New Delhi|New Delhi, India]] during a 30-month trial. The cost of testing in countries without safety regulations is much lower; and, due to lax or nonexistent oversight, pharmaceutical corporations (or research companies they've contracted out to) are able to more easily suppress research that demonstrates harmful effects and only report positive results.<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/2010/12/17/deadly_medicine_fda_fails_to_regulate Deadly Medicine: FDA Fails to Regulate Rapidly Growing Industry of Overseas Drug Testing], ''Democracy Now!'', December 17, 2010</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Deadly Medicine|author=Barlett, Donald L. & Steele, James B.|work=Vanity Fair|date=January 2011|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2011/01/deadly-medicine-201101?printable=true&currentPage=3#ixzz18NY8yGh9}}</ref>

In May 2004, a young man named Dan Markingson committed suicide in a controversial [[AstraZeneca]]-funded study of [[atypical antipsychotics]] conducted by the [[University of Minnesota]] Department of Psychiatry. Markingson had been recruited into the study while acutely psychotic after he had been placed under an involuntary commitment order, the terms of which instructed him to obey the treatment orders of his psychiatrist.

In 1914, [[Joseph Goldberger]] restricted prisoner diets to induce [[pellagra]], which he suspected were caused by [[malnutrition|vitamin deficiencies]], not infectious diseases, as was believed at the time. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize for his work.

From early 1940 until 1953, Dr. [[Lauretta Bender]], a highly respected pediatric neuropsychiatrist who practiced at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, performed electroshock experiments on at least 100 children. The children's ages ranged from 3–12 years. Some reports indicate that she may have performed such experiments on more than 200. Electroconvulsive treatment was used on more than 500 children at Bellevue Hospital from 1942 to 1956, including Bender's experiments, and then at Creedmoor State Hospital Children's Service from 1956 to 1969. Publicly, Bender claimed that the results of the "therapy" were positive, but in private memos, she expressed frustration over mental health issues caused by the treatments.<ref>Albarelli Jr., H.P.; Kaye, Jeffrey S.; [http://www.truth-out.org/the-hidden-tragedy-cias-experiments-children62208 "The Hidden Tragedy of the CIA's Experiments on Children"], ''Truthout'', Wednesday August 11, 2010</ref> Bender would sometimes shock schizophrenic children (some less than 3 years old) twice per day, for 20 consecutive days.

At Willowbrook State School for the mentally disabled in Staten Island, NY,  a highly controversial medical study was carried out there between 1963 and 1966 by medical researchers Saul Krugman and Robert W. McCollum. Dr. Saul Krugman injected disabled children with live hepatitis virus in experiments for the U.S. Army.  After infecting the children, Krugman would then experiment with developing a vaccine to be used to protect United States military personnel from the chronic and often fatal disease.  In addition, feces were taken from institutionalized children with hepatitis and put it in milkshakes which were then fed to newly admitted children. This, despite the morbidity and mortality of this disease, which causes cirrhosis of the liver more frequently than from excessive consumption of alcohol. Poor families were often coerced into allowing their children to be included in these “treatments” as a prerequisite for admission into the state school which was the only option for working-class families needing care for a child suffering from mental retardation or other disability. (“Surely, the duress upon these parents with children so defective as to require institutionalization was far greater than the duress on prisoners given tobacco or paid or promised parole for their cooperation.” Paul Ramsey, 7/6/11, Dr. David D. Rutstein adheres to a stricter standard in regard to research on infectious hepatitis: "It is not ethical to use human subjects for the growth of a virus for any purpose. http://philosophy.tamucc.edu/print/583). 
Staff at Willowbrook, who later quit in disagreement or disgust over the experiments, testified to the pressure put on families and the false reassurances they got from the doctors.  When the school was finally closed, the children who once resided there were often refused entry to regular school’s programs for Special Needs because they were infected with the hepatitis virus. Krugman was not only never censured for these abuses, but was awarded the Lasker Prize for Medicine.  [3] A public outcry forced the study to be discontinued after it was exposed and condemnend by Senator Robert F. Kennedy.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Bryant Park Project |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87975196 |title=Remembering an Infamous New York Institution |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2012-12-16}}</ref> New York Senator Robert Kennedy and a television crew visit Willowbrook State school in Staten Island NY.

Dr Krugman was appointed head of the Pediatrics Academy in 1972.  <ref>http://philosophy.tamucc.edu/print/583</ref>

In 1950, researchers at the Cleveland City Hospital ran experiments to study changes in [[cerebrum|cerebral]] blood flow where they injected people with spinal [[anesthesia]], and inserted needles into their jugular veins and brachial arteries to extract large quantities of blood, and after massive blood loss which caused [[paralysis]] and [[fainting]], measured their [[blood pressure]]. The experiment was often performed multiple times on the same subject.<ref name="goliszek-223-225" />

In a series of studies which were published in the medical journal ''Pediatrics'', researchers from the [[University of California]] Department of Pediatrics performed experiments on 113 newborns ranging in age from 1-hour to 3 days, where they studied changes in blood pressure and blood flow. In one of the studies, researchers forced a [[catheter]] through the babies' [[umbilical arteries]] and into their [[aortas]], and then submerged their feet in ice water.  In another of the studies, they strapped 50 newborn babies to a [[circumcision]] board, and then turned them upside down so that all of their blood rushed into their heads.<ref name="goliszek-223-225" />

From 1963 to 1969 as part of [[Project Shipboard Hazard and Defense]] (SHAD), the U.S. Army performed tests which involved spraying several U.S. ships with various biological and chemical warfare agents, while thousands of U.S. military personnel were aboard the ships. The personnel were not notified of the tests, and were not given any protective clothing. Chemicals tested on the U.S. military personnel included the nerve gases [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] and [[Sarin]], toxic chemicals such as [[zinc cadmium sulfide]] and [[sulfur dioxide]], and a variety of biological agents.<ref name="rogue-state-152-154">{{Cite book|last=Blum|first=William|title=Rogue state: a guide to the world's only superpower|publisher=Zed Books|year=2006|pages=152–154|isbn=978-1-84277-827-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=oBM8UiDYz1MC&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=%22whooping+cough%22+CIA+tampa+1955&q=%22whooping%20cough%22%20CIA%20tampa%201955}}</ref>

==Legal, academic and professional policy==
{{Main|Human subject research legislation in the United States}}

During the [[Nuremberg trials]], several of the Nazi doctors and scientists who were being tried for their human experiments claimed that the inspiration for their studies had come from studies that they had seen performed in the United States.<ref name="germ-war" /><ref name="textbook-research-ethics-26-29" />  In 1945, as part of [[Operation Paperclip]], the United States government recruited 1,600 Nazi scientists, many of whom had performed human experimentation in [[Nazi concentration camps]]. The scientists were offered immunity from any [[war crimes]] they had committed during the course of their work for the Nazi government, in return for doing similar research for the United States government. Many of the Nazi scientists continued their human experimentation when they arrived in the United States.<ref name="goliszek-paperclip">Goliszek, 2003: pp. 108–109</ref>{{Examples|date=September 2012}}

A secret AEC document dated April 17, 1947, titled ''Medical Experiments in Humans'' stated: "''It is desired that no document be released which refers to experiments with humans that might have an adverse reaction on [[public opinion]] or result in legal suits. Documents covering such fieldwork should be classified Secret.''"<ref name="goliszek-132-134"/>

At the same time, the Public Health Service was instructed to tell citizens downwind from bomb tests that the increases in cancers were due to [[neurosis]], and that women with radiation sickness, hair loss, and burned skin were suffering from "housewife syndrome".<ref name="goliszek-132-134"/>

In 1964, the [[World Medical Association]] passed the [[Declaration of Helsinki]], a set of ethical principles for the medical community regarding human experimentation.

In 1966, the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) Office for Protection of Research Subjects (OPRR) was created, and issued its ''Policies for the Protection of Human Subjects'' which recommended establishing independent review bodies, which were later called [[institutional review boards]].

In 1969, [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]] Judge [[Samuel Steinfeld]] dissented in ''Strunk v. Strunk, 445 S.W.2d 145'', and made the first judicial suggestion that the [[Nuremberg Code]] should be applied to American [[jurisprudence]].

In 1974 the [[National Research Act]] established the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects, and mandated that the [[Public Health Service]] to come up with regulations that would protect the rights of human research subjects.

Project [[MK-ULTRA]] was first brought to wide public attention in 1975 by the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]], through investigations by the [[Church Committee]], and by a presidential commission known as the [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]].<ref name="sci-tech-cia">[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB54/ Science, Technology, and the CIA], ''National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book'', Jeffrey T. Richelson, Editor, September 10, 2001 (Retrieved February 18, 2010)</ref><ref>[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1950/mkultra/index.htm "U.S. Senate: Joint Hearing before The Select Committee on Intelligence and The Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research of the Committee on Human Resources"], 95th Cong., 1st Sess. August 3, 1977.</ref>

In 1975, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (DHEW) created regulation which included the recommendations laid out in the NIH's 1966 ''Policies for the Protection of Human Subjects''. Title 45 of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]], known as "The Common Rule," requires the appointment and utilization of institutional review boards (IRBs) in experiments using human subjects.

On April 18, 1979, prompted by an investigative journalist's public disclosure of the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiments]], the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (later renamed to [[Health and Human Services]]) released a report entitled "''Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research''," authored by Dan Harms, which laid out many modern guidelines for ethical medical research.

In 1987 the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in [[United States v. Stanley]], 483 U.S. 669, that a U.S. serviceman who was given [[LSD]] without his consent, as part of military experiments, could not sue the U.S. Army for damages.

Dissenting the verdict in ''U.S. v. Stanley'', Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] stated:
<blockquote>No judicially crafted rule should insulate from liability the involuntary and unknowing human experimentation alleged to have occurred in this case. Indeed, as Justice Brennan observes, the United States played an instrumental role in the [[criminal justice|criminal prosecution]] of Nazi scientists who [[Nazi human experimentation|experimented with human subjects]] during the [[Second World War]], and the standards that the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg Military Tribunals]] developed to judge the behavior of the defendants stated that the 'voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential ... to satisfy moral, ethical, and legal concepts.' If this principle is violated, the very least that society can do is to see that the victims are compensated, as best they can be, by the perpetrators.</blockquote>

On January 15, 1994, President Bill Clinton formed the [[Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments]] (ACHRE). This committee was created to investigate and report the use of human beings as test subjects in experiments involving the effects of ionizing radiation in federally funded research. The committee attempted to determine the causes of the experiments, and reasons why the proper oversight did not exist, and made several recommendations to help prevent future occurrences of similar events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eh.doe.gov/ohre/roadmap/achre/report.html |title=Final report of ACHRE |publisher=Eh.doe.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-16}}</ref>

As of 2007, not a single U.S. government researcher had been prosecuted for human experimentation, and many of the victims of U.S. government experiments have not received compensation, or in many cases, acknowledgment of what was done to them.<ref name="handbook-whitecollar-crime">{{Cite book|title=International handbook of white-collar and corporate crime|url=http://books.google.com/?id=H5PLm3pUHeYC&pg=PA62&dq=single+researcher+%22has+been+prosecuted%22+human+experiments+united+states&q|page=62|editors=Henry N.
