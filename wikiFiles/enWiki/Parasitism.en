'''Parasitism''' is a non-mutual relationship between [[organism]]s of different [[species]] where one organism, the '''parasite''', benefits at the expense of the other, the [[Host (biology)|host]]. Traditionally ''parasite'' referred to organisms with lifestages that needed more than one host (e.g. ''[[Taenia solium]]''). These are now called [[macroparasite]]s (typically [[Protozoan infection|protozoa]] and [[helminths]]). ''Parasite'' now also refers to [[microparasite]]s, which are typically smaller, such as [[viruses]] and [[Bacterial infection|bacteria]], and can be directly transmitted between hosts of the same species.<ref name="Combes">Claude Combes, ''The Art of being a Parasite'', U. of Chicago Press, 2005</ref> Examples of parasites include the plants [[mistletoe]] and [[cuscuta]], and organisms such as [[hookworms]].

Unlike [[Predation|predators]], parasites are generally much smaller than their host; both are special cases of [[Consumer-Resource Systems|consumer-resource interactions]].<ref>Getz, W. (2011). Biomass transformation webs provide a unified approach to consumer–resource modelling. Ecology Letters, {{doi|10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01566.x}}.</ref> Parasites show a high degree of [[Generalist and specialist species|specialization]], and [[reproduction|reproduce]] at a faster rate than their hosts. Classic examples of parasitism include interactions between [[vertebrate]] hosts and diverse animals such as [[Cestoda|tapeworms]], [[Trematoda|flukes]], the ''[[Plasmodium]]'' species, and [[Siphonaptera|fleas]].

Parasitism is differentiated from the [[parasitoid]] relationship by the fact that parasitoids generally kill their hosts.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Parasitoidism occurs in a similar variety of organisms to that in which parasitism occurs.

Parasites reduce host [[Fitness (biology)|biological fitness]] by general or specialized [[pathology]], such as [[parasitic castration]] and impairment of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, to the modification of host behaviour. Parasites increase their fitness by exploiting hosts for resources necessary for their survival, e.g. food, water, heat, habitat, and [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]].

Although parasitism applies unambiguously to many cases, it is part of a continuum of types of [[Biological interactions|interactions]] between [[species]], rather than an exclusive category. Particular interactions between species may satisfy some but not all parts of the definition. In many cases, it is difficult to demonstrate that the host is harmed. In others, there may be no apparent specialization on the part of the parasite, or the interaction between the organisms may be short-lived.

== Etymology ==
First used in English 1539, the word ''parasite'' comes from the [[Medieval French]] ''parasite'', from the [[Latin]] ''parasitus'', the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of  the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''παράσιτος'' (''parasitos''), "one who eats at the table of another"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpara%2Fsitos παράσιτος],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> and that from ''παρά'' (''para''), "beside, by"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpara%2F παρά], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> + ''σῖτος'' (''sitos''), "wheat".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsi%3Dtos σῖτος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> Coined in English in 1611, the word ''parasitism'' comes from the Greek ''παρά'' (''para'') + ''σιτισμός'' (''sitismos'') "feeding, fattening".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsitismo%2Fs σιτισμός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref>

== Types ==
Parasites are classified based on their interactions with their hosts and on their [[biological life cycle|life cycle]]s.
[[File:Male human head louse.jpg|right|thumb|Human head lice (''[[Pediculus humanus capitis]]'') are ectoparasites.]]
Parasites that live on the surface of the host are called '''ectoparasites''' (e.g. some [[mite]]s). Those that live inside the host are called '''endoparasites''' (including all [[parasitic worms]]). Endoparasites can exist in one of two forms: '''intercellular parasites''' (inhabiting spaces in the host’s body) or [[intracellular parasite]]s (inhabiting cells in the host’s body). Intracellular parasites, such as [[protozoa]], [[bacteria]] or [[viruses]], tend to rely on a third organism, which is generally known as the carrier or vector.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The vector does the job of transmitting them to the host. An example of this interaction is the transmission of [[malaria]], caused by a protozoan of the genus ''[[Plasmodium]]'', to humans by the bite of an [[Anopheles|anopheline mosquito]]. Those parasites living in an intermediate position, being half-ectoparasites and half-endoparasites, are sometimes called '''mesoparasite'''.

[[File:Schistosoma mansoni2.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Schistosoma mansoni]]'' is an endoparasite that lives in human blood vessels.]]
An '''epiparasite''' is one that feeds on another parasite. This relationship is also sometimes referred to as ''[[hyperparasitism]],'' exemplified by a protozoan (the hyperparasite) living in the digestive tract of a flea living on a dog.

'''Social parasites''' take advantage of interactions between members of social organisms such as [[ant]]s or [[termite]]s. In ''[[kleptoparasitism]]'', parasites appropriate food gathered by the host. An example is the [[brood parasitism]] practiced by many species of [[cuckoo]] and [[cowbird]], which do not build nests of their own but rather deposit their eggs in nests of other [[species]] and abandon them there. The host behaves as a "[[Babysitting|babysitter]]" as they raise the young as their own. If the host removes the cuckoo's eggs, some cuckoos will return and attack the nest to compel host birds to remain subject to this parasitism.<ref>"Bullies of the Bird World". ''National Wildlife Magazine''. Aug/Sep 1997, Vol. 35 No. 5 [http://www.nwf.org/nationalwildlife/article.cfm?issueID=13&articleID=662]</ref> The cowbird’s parasitism does not necessarily harm its host’s brood; however, the cuckoo may remove one or more host eggs to avoid detection, and furthermore the young cuckoo may heave the host’s eggs and nestlings out of the nest.

Intraspecific social parasitism may also occur.  One example of this is parasitic nursing, where some individuals take milk from unrelated females.  In [[wedge-capped capuchin]]s, higher ranking females sometimes take milk from low ranking females without any reciprocation.  The high ranking females benefit at the expense of the low ranking females.<ref name = obrien5>{{cite journal | author = O'Brien, Timothy G. | year = 1988 | title = Parasitic nursing behavior in the wedge-capped capuchin monkey (Cebus olivaceus) | journal = American Journal of Primatology | volume = 16 | pages = 341–344}}</ref>

Parasitism can take the form of isolated ''[[Cheating (biology)|cheating]]'' or ''exploitation'' among more generalized [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] interactions. For example, broad classes of [[plants]] and [[fungi]] exchange carbon and nutrients in common mutualistic [[mycorrhizal]] relationships; however, some plant species known as [[myco-heterotrophy|myco-heterotrophs]] "cheat" by taking carbon from a fungus rather than donating it.

''[[Parasitoid]]s'' are organisms whose larval development occurs inside or on the surface of another organism, resulting in the death of the host.<ref>{{cite journal|author=H. Charles & J. Godfray|title=Parasitoids|journal=Current Biology Magazine|volume=14|issue=12|pages=R456|year=2004|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.06.004|pmid=15203011}} [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VRT-4CNT0D6-4&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=3c7a3e2fbf44ccce8f7e74d13c1a72a9]</ref> This means that the interaction between the parasitoid and the host is fundamentally different from that of a true parasite and shares some of the characteristics of [[predation]].

An adelpho-parasite is a parasite in which the host species is closely related to the parasite, often being a member of the same family or genus. An example of this is the citrus blackfly parasitoid, ''[[Encarsia perplexa]]'', unmated females of which may lay [[Ploidy#haploid|haploid]] eggs in the fully developed larvae of their own species. These result in the production of male offspring.<ref>[http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/beneficial/encarsia_perplexa.htm Featured Creatures]</ref>  The marine worm ''[[Bonellia viridis]]'' has a similar reproductive strategy, although the larvae are planktonic.<ref>Larry Gonick and Mark Wheelis, ''The Cartoon Guide to Genetics''. HarperCollins, 1991.</ref>

==Host defenses==
{{Expand section|date=February 2012}}
Hosts respond to parasitisms in many ways ranging from the morphological to the behavioural. In some cases, [[plant]]s produce [[toxin]]s to deter parasitic [[fungus|fungi]] and [[bacterium|bacteria]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} [[Vertebrate]] animals have developed complex [[immune system]]s, which can target parasites through contact with bodily fluids.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Animals are also known to resort to behavioral defenses, examples of which are the avoidance by [[sheep]] of open pastures during spring, when [[nematode|roundworm]] eggs accumulated over the previous year hatch en masse;{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} and the ingestion of alcohol by infected fruit flies as self-medication against blood-borne parasites.<ref name="">{{cite journal |last1=Milan |first1=Neil F.|last2=Kacsoh|first2=Balint Z.|last3=Schlenke |year=Todd A. |title=Alcohol Consumption as Self-Medication against Blood-Borne Parasites in the Fruit Fly |journal=Current Biology |publisher=Elsevier |volume= 22|issue= 6|pages= 488–93|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982212000759 |issn=0960-9822|format=In Press, Corrected proof|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2012.01.045 |accessdate=17 February 2012 |first3=Todd A. |pmid=22342747 |pmc=3311762}}</ref>
In humans, parasite immunity is developed prominently by [[Immunoglobulin E]] antibodies.

== Evolutionary aspects ==
Biotrophic parasitism is a common mode of life that has arisen independently many times in the course of [[evolution]]. Depending on the definition used, as many as half of all [[animal]]s have at least one parasitic phase in their life cycles,<ref name="Price">Price, P.W. 1980. Evolutionary Biology of Parasites. Princeton University Press, Princeton</ref> and it is also frequent in [[plant]]s and [[fungi]]. Moreover, almost all free-living animals are host to one or more parasitic [[taxon|taxa]].<ref name="Price" />
[[File:Tyrannosaurus with infection.jpg|thumb|Restoration of a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' with parasite infections. A 2009 study showed that holes in the skulls of several specimens might have been caused by ''[[Trichomonas]]''-like parasites<ref>[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007288;jsessionid=46F0A1EFB5E7F840BE2194BA7F0AEC02 Plosone.org]</ref>]]

Parasites evolve in response to the defense mechanisms of their hosts.  As a result of host defenses, some parasites evolve adaptations that are specific to a particular host [[taxon]], specializing to the point where they infect only a single species. Such narrow host specificity can be costly over evolutionary time, however, if the host species becomes [[extinction|extinct]]. Therefore many parasites can infect a variety of more or less closely related host species, with different success rates.

Host defenses also evolve in response to attacks by parasites. Theoretically, parasites may have an advantage in this [[evolutionary arms race]] because their [[generation time]] commonly is shorter. Hosts reproduce less quickly than parasites, and therefore have fewer chances to [[adaptation|adapt]] than their parasites do over a given span of time.

In some cases, a parasitic species may [[Co-evolution|coevolve]] with its host [[taxon|taxa]]. Long-term coevolution sometimes leads to a relatively stable relationship tending to [[commensalism]] or [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], as, all else being equal, it is in the evolutionary interest of the parasite that its host thrives. A parasite may evolve to become less harmful for its host or a host may evolve to cope with the unavoidable presence of a parasite—to the point that the parasite's absence causes the host harm. For example, although animals infected with [[parasitic worm]]s are often clearly harmed, and therefore parasitized, such infections may also reduce the prevalence and effects of [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]] disorders in animal hosts, including humans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rook, G.A.W. |title=The hygiene hypothesis and the increasing prevalence of chronic inflammatory disorders|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene |volume=101 |pages=1072–4 |year=2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.trstmh.2007.05.014 |pmid=17619029 |issue=11}}</ref>

Competition between parasites tends to favor faster reproducing and therefor more [[Virulence|virulent]] parasites.  Parasites whose life cycle involves the death of the host, to exit the present host and sometimes to enter the next, evolve to be more virulent or even alter the behavior or other properties of the host to make it more vulnerable to predators.  Parasites that reproduce largely to the offspring of the previous host tend to become less virulent or [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualist]], so that its hosts reproduce more effectively.<ref name="Combes" />

The presumption of a shared evolutionary history between parasites and hosts can sometimes elucidate how host taxa are related. For instance, there has been dispute about whether [[Phoenicopteriformes|flamingos]] are more closely related to the [[Ciconiiformes|storks]] and their relatives, or to [[Anseriformes|ducks, geese]] and their relatives. The fact that flamingos share parasites with ducks and geese is evidence these groups may be more closely related to each other than either is to storks.

Parasitism is part of one explanation for the evolution of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s seen in breeding males throughout the [[animal]] world, such as the plumage of male [[peacock]]s and manes of male [[lion]]s. According to this theory, female hosts select males for breeding based on such characteristics because they indicate resistance to parasites and other [[disease]].

=== Co-speciation ===
In rare cases, a parasite may even undergo co-speciation with its host. One particularly remarkable example of co-speciation exists between the [[simian foamy virus]] (SFV) and its primate hosts. In one study, the phylogenies of SFV polymerase and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit II from African and Asian primates were compared.<ref>SwitzerWM, Salemi M, Shanmugam V, Gao F, Cong ME, Kuiken C, Bhullar V, Beer BE, Vallet D, Gautier-Hion A, Tooze Z, Villinger F, Holmes EC, Heneine W. Ancient co-speciation of simian foamy viruses and primates. Nature. 2005 Mar 17; 434(7031):376-80.</ref> Surprisingly, the phylogenetic trees were very congruent in branching order and divergence times. Thus, the simian foamy viruses may have co-speciated with Old World primates for at least 30 million years.

== Ecology ==

=== Quantitative ecology ===
A single parasite species usually has an aggregated distribution across host individuals, which means that most hosts harbor few parasites, while a few hosts carry the vast majority of parasite individuals. This poses considerable problems for students of parasite ecology: the use of [[parametric statistics]] should be avoided.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} [[Data transformation (statistics)#Logarithmic transformation|Log-transformation]] of data before the application of parametric test, or the use of [[non-parametric statistics]] is recommended by several authors. However, this can give rise to further problems.<ref>[http://www.zoologia.hu/list/quant_large.pdf Rózsa L, Reiczigel J, Majoros G 2000. Quantifying parasites in samples of hosts. ''Journal of Parasitology,'' '''86,''' 228-232.]</ref> Therefore, modern day [[quantitative parasitology]] is based on more advanced biostatistical methods.

=== Diversity ecology ===
Hosts represent discrete habitat patches that can be occupied by parasites. A hierarchical set of terminology has come into use to describe parasite assemblages at different host scales.

;Infrapopulation:All the parasites of one species in a single individual host.
;[[Metapopulation]]:All the parasites of one species in a host population.
;Infracommunity:All the parasites of all species in a single individual host.
;Component community:All the parasites of all species in a host population.
;Compound community:All the parasites of all species in all host species in an ecosystem.

The diversity ecology of parasites differs markedly from that of free-living organisms. For free-living organisms, diversity ecology features many strong conceptual frameworks including [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson]]'s [[island biogeography|theory of island biogeography]], [[Jared Diamond]]'s [[assembly rules]] and, more recently, [[Null hypothesis|null model]]s such as [[Stephen Hubbell]]'s [[unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography]]. Frameworks are not so well-developed for parasites and in many ways they do not fit the free-living models. For example, island biogeography is predicated on fixed spatial relationships between [[Patch dynamics|habitat patches]] ("sinks"), usually with reference to a mainland ("source"). Parasites inhabit hosts, which represent mobile habitat patches with dynamic spatial relationships. There is no true "mainland" other than the sum of hosts (host population), so parasite component communities in host populations are metacommunities.

Nonetheless, different types of parasite assemblages have been recognized in host individuals and populations, and many of the patterns observed for free-living organisms are also pervasive among parasite assemblages. The most prominent of these is the interactive-isolationist continuum. This proposes that parasite assemblages occur along a cline from interactive communities, where niches are saturated and interspecific competition is high, to isolationist communities, where there are many vacant niches and interspecific interaction is not as important as stochastic factors in providing structure to the community. Whether this is so, or whether community patterns simply reflect the sum of underlying species distributions (no real "structure" to the community), has not yet been established.

== Adaptation ==
Parasites infect hosts that exist within their same geographical area ([[sympatric]]) more effectively. This phenomenon supports the "[[Red Queen's Hypothesis|Red Queen hypothesis]]—which states that interactions between species (such as host and parasites) lead to constant natural selection for adaptation and counter adaptation."<ref name="Lively00">Lively, Curtis M. and Dybdahl, Mark F. "Parasite adaptation to locally common host genotypes." ''Nature''. Vol. 405. 8 June 2000.</ref> The parasites track the locally common host phenotypes, therefore the parasites are less infective to [[allopatric]] (from different geographical region) hosts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Experiments published in 2000 discuss the analysis of two different snail populations from two different sources- [[Lake Ianthe]] and [[Lake Poerua]] in [[New Zealand]]. The populations were exposed to two pure parasites ([[digenetic trematode]]) taken from the same lakes. In the experiment, the snails were infected by their sympatric parasites, allopatric parasites and mixed sources of parasites. The results suggest that the parasites were more highly effective in infecting their sympatric snails than their allopatric snails. Though the allopatric snails were still infected by the parasites, the infectivity was much less when compared to the sympatric snails. Hence, the parasites were found to have adapted to infecting local populations of snails.<ref name="Lively00" />

=== Transmission ===
[[File:Entamoeba histolytica life cycle-en.svg|thumb|Life cycle of ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'', an anaerobic parasitic protozoan.]]
Parasites inhabit living organisms and therefore face problems that free-living organisms do not. Hosts, the only habitats in which parasites can survive, actively try to avoid, repel, and destroy parasites. Parasites employ numerous strategies for getting from one host to another, a process sometimes referred to as parasite ''transmission'' or ''colonization''.

Some endoparasites infect their host by penetrating its external surface, while others must be ingested. Once inside the host, adult endoparasites need to shed offspring into the external environment to infect other hosts. Many adult endoparasites reside in the host’s [[gastrointestinal tract]], where offspring can be shed along with host [[excreta]]. Adult stages of [[Cestoda|tapeworms]], [[Acanthocephala|thorny-headed worms]] and most [[Trematoda|flukes]] use this method.

Among [[protozoa]]n endoparasites, such as the [[malaria]]l parasites and [[Trypanosoma|trypanosome]]s, infective stages in the host’s [[blood]] are transported to new hosts by biting-[[insect]]s, or [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]].

[[Larva]]l stages of endoparasites often infect sites in the host other than the blood or [[gastrointestinal tract]]. In many such cases, larval endoparasites require their host to be consumed by the next host in the [[parasitic life cycles|parasite’s life cycle]] in order to survive and reproduce. Alternatively, larval endoparasites may shed free-living transmission stages that migrate through the host’s tissue into the external environment, where they actively search for or await ingestion by other hosts. The foregoing strategies are used, variously, by larval stages of [[Cestoda|tapeworms]], [[Acanthocephala|thorny-headed worms]], [[Trematoda|flukes]] and parasitic [[Nematoda|roundworms]].

Some ectoparasites, such as [[monogenea]]n worms, rely on direct contact between hosts. Ectoparasitic [[arthropod]]s may rely on host-host contact (e.g. many [[anoplura|lice]]), shed eggs that survive off the host (e.g. [[Siphonaptera|fleas]]), or wait in the external environment for an encounter with a host (e.g. [[tick]]s). Some aquatic [[leech]]es locate hosts by sensing movement and only attach when certain temperature and chemical cues are present.

Some parasites [[Behavior-altering parasites and parasitoids|modify host behavior]] to make transmission to other hosts more likely. For example, in [[California]] salt marshes, the fluke ''[[Euhaplorchis californiensis]]'' reduces the ability of its [[killifish]] host to avoid predators.<ref>Lafferty, K. D. and A. K. Morris. 1996. Altered behavior of parasitized killifish increases susceptibility to predation by bird final hosts. Ecology 77:</ref> This parasite matures in [[egret]]s, which are more likely to feed on infected killifish than on uninfected fish. Another example is the protozoan ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', a parasite that matures in [[Felis silvestris catus|cats]] but can be carried by many other [[Mammalia|mammals]]. Uninfected [[Rattus rattus|rats]] avoid cat odors, but rats infected with ''T. gondii'' are drawn to this scent, which may increase transmission to feline hosts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Berdoy M, Webster JP, Macdonald DW |title=Fatal attraction in rats infected with Toxoplasma gondii |journal=Proc. Biol. Sci. |volume=267 |issue=1452 |pages=1591–4 |year=2000|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1182 | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid= |pmid=11007336 |pmc=1690701 |format=}} {{dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref>

=== Roles in ecosystems ===
Modifying the behavior of infected hosts, to make transmission to other hosts more likely to occur, is one way parasites can affect the structure of [[ecosystem]]s. For example, in the case of ''[[Euhaplorchis californiensis]]'' (discussed above) it is plausible that the local [[Predation|predator and prey]] species might be different if this parasite were absent from the system.

Although parasites are often omitted in depictions of [[food web]]s, they usually occupy the top position. Parasites can function like [[keystone species]], reducing the dominance of superior competitors and allowing competing species to co-exist.

Many parasites require multiple hosts of the different species to complete their life cycles and rely on predator-prey or other stable ecological interactions to get from one host to another. In this sense, the parasites in an ecosystem reflect the "health" of that system.

== Value ==

Although parasites are generally considered to be harmful, the eradication of all parasites would not necessarily be beneficial.  Parasites account for as much as or more than half of life's diversity; they perform an important ecological role (by weakening prey) that ecosystems would take some time to adapt to; and without parasites organisms may eventually tend to asexual reproduction, diminishing the diversity of sexually dimorphic traits.<ref name="Holt2010">{{cite doi|10.1560/IJEE.56.3-4.239}}</ref>
Parasites provide an opportunity for the transfer of genetic material between species.  On rare, but significant, occasions this may facilitate evolutionary changes that would not otherwise occur, or that would otherwise take even longer.<ref name="Combes" />
