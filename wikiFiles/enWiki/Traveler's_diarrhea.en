'''Traveler's diarrhea''' or '''traveller's diarrhoea''' ('''TD''') is the most common illness affecting travelers.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/travelersdiarrhea_g.htm Disease Listing, Travelers' Diarrhea, General Information | CDC Bacterial, Mycotic Diseases<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  An estimated 10 million people—20% to 50% of international travelers—develop it annually.<ref name=CDC_TD>{{cite web |title=Travelers' Diarrhea |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/travelersdiarrhea_g.htm |date=November 21, 2006 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref> TD is defined as three or more unformed [[human feces|stool]]s in 24 hours passed by a traveler, commonly accompanied by abdominal cramps, nausea, and bloating.<ref name=SWOL-TD>{{cite web|url=http://www.safewateronline.com/travelers_d.htm|title=Travelers' diarrhea|publisher=safewateronline.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080606032848/http://www.safewateronline.com/travelers_d.htm |archivedate = 6 June 2008}}</ref> Its diagnosis does not imply a specific organism, but [[Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli|enterotoxigenic ''Escherichia coli'']] is the most commonly isolated pathogen.<ref name="urlDorlands Medical Dictionary:travelers diarrhea">{{cite web |url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jspzQzpgzEzzSzppdocszSzuszSzcommonzSzdorlandszSzdorlandzSzthreezSz000029504zPzhtm |title=Dorlands Medical Dictionary:traveler's diarrhea |work= |accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref>  Most cases are self-limited; treatment is not routinely prescribed nor the pathogen identified unless symptoms become severe or persistent.

==Signs and symptoms ==
The onset of TD usually occurs within the first week of travel, but may occur at any time while traveling, and even after returning home. When it appears depends in part on the specific infectious agent.  The incubation period for [[giardiasis]] averages about 14 days and that of [[cryptosporidiosis]] about seven days. Certain other bacterial and viral agents have shorter incubation periods, although hepatitis may take weeks to manifest itself.  Most TD cases begin abruptly. 

Typically, a traveler experiences four to five loose or watery bowel movements each day. Other commonly associated symptoms are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, bloating, low fever, urgency, and malaise,<ref name="CDC_TD" /> and appetite is usually low or nonexistent.<ref name=SWOL-TD/>

Blood or [[mucus]] in the diarrhea, abdominal pain, or high fever heralds a more serious cause, such as [[cholera]], characterized by a rapid onset of [[symptom]]s including weakness, [[malaise]], and torrents of watery diarrhea with flecks of mucus (described as "rice water" stools).  Dehydration is a serious consequence of cholera; death may (rarely) occur as quickly as 24 hours after onset.<ref name=SWOL-TD/>

[[Pathogen|Infectious agent]]s are the primary cause of travelers' diarrhea. [[Enterobacteriaceae|Bacterial enteropathogens]] cause approximately 80% of cases.  [[Viruses]] and [[protozoans]] account for most of the rest.<ref name="CDC_TD"/>

The most common causative agent isolated in countries surveyed has been [[Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli|enterotoxigenic ''Escherichia coli'']] (ETEC).<ref name="CDC_TD"/> Enteroaggregative ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' is increasingly recognized and many studies do not look for this important bacterium.<ref name=SWOL-TD/> ''[[Shigella]] spp.'' and ''[[Salmonella]] spp.'' are other common bacterial pathogens.  ''[[Campylobacter]]'', ''[[Yersinia]]'', ''[[Aeromonas]]'', and ''[[Plesiomonas]] spp.'' are less frequently found.  Some bacteria release [[toxin]]s which bind to the intestinal wall and cause diarrhea; others damage the intestines themselves by their direct presence. 

While viruses are associated with less than 20% of adult cases of traveler's diarrhea, they may be responsible for nearly 70% of cases in infants and children. Diarrhea due to viral agents is unaffected by antibiotic therapy, but is usually self-limited.<ref name=SWOL-TD/>  Protozoans such as ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'' and ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' can also cause diarrhea.

Pathogens implicated in travelers' diarrhea appear in the table at right.<ref name=SWOL-TD/>

A sub-type of traveler's diarrhea afflicting hikers and campers, sometimes known as [[wilderness diarrhea]], may have a somewhat different frequency distribution of pathogens.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Risk factors===
The primary source of infection is ingestion of [[fecal]]ly-contaminated food or water.  Attack rates are similar for men and women.<ref name="CDC_TD" />  

The most important determinant of risk is the traveler's destination. High risk destinations include [[developing country|developing countries]] in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.<ref name="CDC_TD" /> Among backpackers, additional risk factors include drinking untreated surface water and failure to maintain personal hygiene practices and clean cookware.<ref name="pmid16805145">{{cite journal |author=Hargreaves JS |title=Laboratory evaluation of the 3-bowl system used for washing-up eating utensils in the field |journal=Wilderness Environ Med |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=94–102 |year=2006 |pmid=16805145 |doi= 10.1580/PR17-05.1|url=http://www.wemjournal.org/article/S1080-6032(06)70296-4/fulltext |location=Diarrhea is a common illness of wilderness travelers, occurring in about one third of expedition participants and participants on wilderness recreation courses. The incidence of diarrhea may be as high as 74% on adventure trips. …Wilderness diarrhea is not caused solely by waterborne pathogens, … poor hygiene, with fecal-oral transmission, is also a contributing factor |format=}} </ref> Campsites often have very primitive (if any) sanitation facilities, making them potentially as dangerous as any developing country.

Although traveler's diarrhea usually resolves within three to five days (mean duration: 3.6 days), in about 20% of cases the illness is severe enough to require bedrest, and in 10% the illness duration exceeds one week.<ref name=SWOL-TD/>  For those prone to serious infections, such as  [[bacillary dysentery]], [[amoebic dysentery]], and [[cholera]], TD can occasionally be life-threatening.<ref name=SWOL-TD/>  Others at higher-than-average risk include young adults, [[immunosuppression|immunosuppressed]] persons, persons with [[inflammatory bowel disease]] or [[diabetes]], and those taking [[H2 antagonist|H2 blockers]] or [[antacids]].<ref name="CDC_TD"/>

===Immunity===
Travelers often get diarrhea from eating and drinking foods and beverages that have no adverse effects on local residents. This is due to [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] that develops with constant, repeated exposure to pathogenic organisms. The extent and duration of exposure necessary to acquire immunity has not been determined; it may vary with each individual organism.  However, a study among expatriates in Nepal suggests that immunity may take up to seven years to develop—presumably in adults who avoid deliberate pathogen exposure.<ref>David R. Shlim, [http://www.ciwec-clinic.com/diar/index.html#9 Understanding Diarrhea in Travelers. A Guide to the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of the World's Most Common Travel-Related Illness]. CIWEC Clinic Travel Medicine Center, 2004.</ref>
Conversely, immunity that American students acquired while living in Mexico disappeared, in one study, as quickly as 8 weeks after cessation of exposure.<ref name="ostrosky">Luis Ostrosky-Zeichner, Charles D. Ericsson,

==Prevention==
The best means of prevention is to avoid any questionable foods or beverages.  Traveler's diarrhea is fundamentally a sanitation failure, leading to bacterial contamination of drinking water and food. It is best prevented through proper water quality management systems, as found in responsible hotels and resorts. In the absence of that, the next best option for travelers is to take individual precautions:

* Drink safe beverages, which include bottled water, bottled [[carbonated]] beverages, hot tea or coffee, and water boiled or appropriately treated by the traveler.<ref name=SWOL-TD/> Caution should be exercised with hot beverages, which may be only heated, not boiled.
* Maintain good hygiene and only use [[safe water]] for drinking and tooth brushing.<ref name=SWOL-TD/>
* Avoid ice, which may not have been made with bottled water.
* In restaurants, insist that bottled water be unsealed in your presence.  Reports of locals filling empty bottles with untreated tap water and reselling them as purified water have surfaced.<ref name=SWOL-TD/>  When in doubt, a bottled carbonated beverage is the safest choice, since it is difficult to carbonate water when refilling a used bottle.
* Avoid eating raw fruits and vegetables unless the traveler peels them personally.<ref name="CDC_TD" />
* Avoid green salads, because it is unlikely that the lettuce will have been washed with bottled water.<ref name="CDC_TD" />

If handled properly, well-cooked and packaged foods are usually safe.<ref name="CDC_TD" /> Eating raw or undercooked meat and seafood should be avoided. [[Pasteurization|Unpasteurized]] milk, dairy products, mayonnaise and pastry icing are associated with increased risk for TD, as are foods or drinking beverages purchased from street vendors or other establishments where unhygienic conditions may be present.<ref name=SWOL-TD/>

Travelers can treat their own water if necessary, although the wide availability of safe bottled water makes these interventions unnecessary for all but the most remote destinations.<ref name=SWOL-TD/> Techniques include boiling, filtering, chemical treatment, and ultraviolet light. Boiling kills all bacteria and viruses immediately. (It is not necessary to keep it at a boil for any length of time.<ref>National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods: Requisite Scientific Parameters for Establishing the Equivalence of Aalternative Methods of Pasteurization, USDA , 2004</ref> All microorganisms are killed within seconds as the temperature passes 55-70 C.) Filters eliminate some microogranisms, but not viruses. Chemical treatment can be done with halogens, which can be in the form of chlorine bleach (2 drops per litre), tincture of iodine (5 drops per litre), or tablets. Halogens are not effective against protozoan cysts such as giardia. An ultraviolet (UV) water purification device is available commercially that allows treatment of small amounts of water at room temperature.  The  UV light bonds DNA [[thymine]] rings, preventing the survival or replication of any infectious organisms in the water.  It kills both viruses and cellular organisms.  Other claimed advantages include no taste alteration, elimination of need for boiling, and decreased long-term cost compared with bottled water.

Other preventive measures include over-the-counter anti-diarrhea products and in certain situations, [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]] medications and supplements.  Studies show a decrease in the incidence of TD with use of [[bismuth subsalicylate]] and antimicrobial [[chemoprophylaxis]].<ref name=SWOL-TD/>  

Bismuth subsalicylate (two tablets or two ounces four times daily) will reduce the likelihood of travelers' diarrhea, but few travelers adhere to a four-times-per-day regimen because it is inconvenient.<ref name = "MDT"/>  Side effects may include black tongue, black stools, nausea, constipation, and ringing in the ears ([[tinnitus]]).  Bismuth subsalicylate should not be taken by those with aspirin allergy, kidney disease, or gout, nor concurrently with certain antibiotics, and should not be taken for more than three weeks.<ref name = "MDT">Traveler's Diarrhea. [http://www.mdtravelhealth.com/infectious/travelers_diarrhea.html MDTravelHealth.com] Retrieved 2010-10-07.</ref> 

Though effective, antibiotics are not recommended in most situations to prevent diarrhea before it occurs, because of the risk of adverse reactions to the antibiotics, and because intake of prophylactic antibiotics may decrease effectiveness of such drugs should a serious infection occur.  Antibiotics can also cause vaginal yeast infections (which many women consider a worse problem than the diarrhea<ref name = "MDT"/>).  Also, antibiotics can cause a disease called [[pseudomembranous colitis]] which results in severe, unrelenting diarrhea.<ref>Travelers' Diarrhea. [http://www.travdoc.com/articles/28.html The Travel Doctor] Retrieved March 21, 2011.</ref>

However, prophylaxis may be warranted in special situations where benefits outweigh the above risks, such as [[immunocompromised]] travelers, chronic intestinal disorders, prior history of repeated disabling bouts of traveler's diarrhea, or scenarios in which onset of diarrhea might prove particularly troublesome.   Options for prophylactic treatment include the quinolone antibiotics ([[norfloxacin]], [[ciprofloxacin]], [[ofloxacin]], among others), and [[trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]].  Quinolone antibiotics may bind to metallic cations such as bismuth, and should not be taken concurrently with bismuth subsalicylate.  Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should not be taken by anyone with a history of sulfa allergy.<ref name = "MDT"/>

A few pathogen-specific [[vaccine]]s have become available, and others are under development.  [[Dukoral]], an oral vaccine against ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', has demonstrated up to 43% protective efficacy against TD when one dose is given a few weeks before travel and a second a week before travel, although it is not officially approved for that indication in most countries.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18564011 Jelinek T, Kollaritsch H. Vaccination with Dukoral against travelers' diarrhea (ETEC) and cholera. ''Expert Rev Vaccines. 2008'' Jul;7(5):561-7.] Retrieved October 14, 2011</ref>  Several vaccine candidates targeting enterotoxigenic ''E. coli'' (ETEC) and ''Shigella'' are in various stages of development.<ref>[http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/diarrhoeal/en/index4.html World Health Organization. Enterotoxigenic ''Escherichia coli'' (ETEC).]</ref><ref>[http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/diarrhoeal/en/index6.html World Health Organization. Shigellosis.]</ref> 

Two [[probiotics]] (''[[Saccharomyces boulardii]]'' and a mixture of ''[[Lactobacillus acidophilus]]'' and ''Bifidobacterium bifidum'') have been studied as a treatment for TD. In a [[meta-analysis]] by McFarland (2005), no serious adverse reactions were reported in 12 trials. These probiotics may offer a safe and effective method to prevent TD, but due to strain stability and survivability issues, they may not always be an appropriate choice.<ref>{{cite journal

[[Prebiotics]], as an alternative, are more stable than probiotics during passage through the upper gastrointestinal tract and are able to induce antimicrobial effects principally through their selective stimulation of our own beneficial gut bacteria. However, prebiotics act mainly in the large intestine, while the infective organisms causing TD act in the small intestine. Therefore, current prebiotics (such as [[fructooligosaccharide]]) have very limited application as preventative agents. Second generation prebiotic [[galactooligosaccharides]], such as B-GOS (Bimuno), have additional properties such as positive effect on immunity<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vulevic|first=J|coauthors=Drakoularakou D, Yaqoob P, Tzortzis G, Gibson GR|title=Modulation of the faecal microflora profile and immune function by a novel trans-galactooligosaccharide mixture (B-GOS) in healthy elderly volunteers|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|year=2008|volume=88|pages=1438–46|pmid=18996881|issue=5}}</ref> and direct interaction with the host gut epithelium, preventing the attachment and invasion of gastrointestinal pathogens.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Searle|first=LEJ|coauthors=Cooley WA, Jones G, Nunez A, Crudgington B, Weyer U, Dugdale AH, Tzortzis G, Woodward MJ, LaRegione RM|title=Purified galactooligosaccharide, derived from a mixture produced by the enzymatic activity of Bifidobacterium bifidum, reduces Salmonella Typhimurim adhesion and invasion in vitro and in vivo|journal=Journal of Medical Microbiology|year=2010|volume=59|pages=1428–39|doi=10.1099/jmm.0.022780-0|pmid=20798214|issue=Pt 12}}</ref> B-GOS was shown to result in significant reduction in the incidence and duration of TD in a study with human volunteers travelling to countries with medium to high risk of developing TD.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Drakoularakou|first=A|coauthors=Tzortzis GT, Rastall RA, Gibson GR|title=A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized human study assessing the capacity of a novel galacto-oligosaccharide mixture in reducing travellers' diarrhoea|journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|year=2009|pages=1–7}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Most cases of TD are mild and resolve in a few days without treatment with antibiotics or antimotility drugs.  Severe or protracted cases, however, may result in significant fluid loss and dangerous [[electrolyte disturbance|electrolytic imbalance]].  Adequate fluid intake ([[oral rehydration therapy]]) is essential to replace lost fluids and [[electrolytes]].  Clear, disinfected water or other liquids are routinely recommended for adults.<ref name="CDC_TD"/> Water that is purified is best, along with [[oral rehydration salts]] to replenish lost electrolytes. Carbonated water (soda), which has been left out so that the carbonation fizz is gone, is useful if nothing else is available.<ref name=SWOL-TD/>  In severe or protracted cases, the oversight of a medical professional is advised.

===Antibiotics===
If diarrhea becomes severe (typically defined as three or more loose stools in a 24-hour period) — or if diarrhea is bloody, or fever occurs with shaking chills, or abdominal pain becomes marked, or diarrhea persists for more than 72 hours — medical treatment should be sought.  Such patients may benefit from antimicrobial therapy.<ref name="CDC_TD"/> Antibiotics are typically given for three to five days,<ref name="CDC_TD"/> but single doses of [[azithromycin]] or levofloxacin have been used.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sanders JW |title=Azithromycin and loperamide are comparable to levofloxacin and loperamide for the treatment of traveler's diarrhea in United States military personnel in Turkey |journal=Clin.

R.}}</ref> If diarrhea persists despite therapy, travelers should be evaluated for possible viral or parasitic infections,<ref name="CDC_TD"/> bacterial or amoebic dysentery, ''Giardia'', helminths, or cholera.<ref name=SWOL-TD/>

===Antimotility agents===
Antimotility drugs such as [[loperamide]] and [[diphenoxylate]] reduce the symptoms of diarrhea by slowing transit time in the gut.  They should be taken as necessary to slow the frequency of stools, but not enough to stop bowel movements completely, which delays expulsion of the causative organisms from the intestines.<ref name="CDC_TD"/> Adverse reactions may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hives or rash, and loss of appetite.<ref>Diphenoxylate package insert. [http://www.drugs.com/mmx/lomotil.html Drugs.com.] Retrieved 2010-10-07.</ref>  Antimotility agents should not, as a rule, be given to children under age two.<ref name = "MDT"/>

==Epidemiology==
Each year 20%&ndash;50% of international travelers (more than 10 million people) develop traveler's diarrhea.<ref name="CDC_TD" /> It is more common in the [[developing world]], where rates exceed 60%, than in developed countries.<ref name=Epi05>{{cite journal|last=Steffen|first=R|title=Epidemiology of traveler's diarrhea|journal=Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America|date=2005 Dec 1|volume=41 Suppl 8|pages=S536–40|pmid=16267715|doi=10.1086/432948}}</ref>

==Society and culture==
There are a number of [[colloquialism]]s for travelers' diarrhea contracted in various localities, such as "Montezuma's revenge", "turistas",<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Turistas Turistas - definition of Turistas in the Medical dictionary - by the Free Online Medical Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> or "Aztec two step" in [[Mexico]]; and "Pharaoh's Revenge," "mummy's tummy," or "Cairo two-step" in [[Egypt]]. Many other colorful synonyms exist in other regions of the world, some of which have found their way into the arts and literature. For example, [[Aamir Khan]] titled his 2011 [[Hindi film]] ''[[Delhi Belly (film)|Delhi Belly]]'', after the popular Indian colloquialism.

===Montezuma's revenge===

{{Redirect|Montezuma's revenge}}
''Montezuma's revenge'' (var. ''Moctezuma's revenge'') is the colloquial term for any cases of traveler's diarrhea contracted by tourists visiting [[Mexico]]. The name refers to [[Moctezuma II]] (1466–1520), the [[Tlatoani]] (ruler) of the [[Aztec]] civilization who was defeated by [[Hernán Cortés]], the [[Spanish conquest|Spanish conquistador]].

===Wilderness diarrhea===
{{Main|Wilderness acquired diarrhea}}

[[Wilderness acquired diarrhea|Wilderness diarrhea]] (WD), also called ''wilderness-acquired diarrhea'' (WAD) or ''backcountry diarrhea'', refers to diarrhea among backpackers, hikers, campers and other outdoor recreationalists that appears in wilderness or "backcountry" situations, either at home or abroad.<ref name="Zell1992">{{cite journal |author=Zell SC |title=Epidemiology of Wilderness-acquired Diarrhea: Implications for Prevention and Treatment |journal=J Wilderness Med |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=241–9 |year=1992 |url=http://www.wemjournal.org/pdfserv/i0953-9859-003-03-0241.pdf |format=PDF|pmid= |doi=10.1580/0953-9859-3.3.241 }}</ref>  It is due to the same agents as all other traveler's diarrhea, which are usually bacterial and viral and caused by hand-to-mouth contamination by fecal microorganisms. Since wilderness campsites seldom provide access to sanitation facilities, the infection risk is similar to that of any developing country.<ref name="pmid16805145"/> The most important preventative measure is to practice good toilet hygiene.<ref>Thomas R. Welch and Timothy P. Welch, "Giardiasis as a threat to backpackers in the United States: a survey of state health departments," Wilderness and Environmental Medicine, 6 (1995) 162, http://www.wemjournal.org/article/S1080-6032%2895%2971046-8/abstract</ref> It may also be helpful to avoid sharing cooking pots.

Wilderness diarrhea is less likely to be caused by contaminated water sources. Starting in the 1970s, it began to be widely believed that [[giardiasis]] was prevalent even in seemingly pristine water, but in fact a 2000 epidemiological study found that "the evidence for an association between drinking backcountry water and acquiring giardiasis is minimal."<ref>Welch, T.P. "Risk of giardiasis from consumption of wilderness water in North America: a systematic review of epidemiologic data," Int J Infect Dis. 2000;4:103100, http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/1201-9712/PIIS1201971200901024.pdf?refuid=S1080-6032(04)70498-6&refissn=1080-6032&mis=.pdf</ref> In many wilderness areas, such as the [[Sierra Nevada mountains]], water taken from streams has fewer giardia cysts than municipal tap water.<ref>Robert L. Rockwell, Sierra Nature Notes, Volume 2, January 2002, http://web.archive.org/web/20051026030831/www.yosemite.org/naturenotes/Giardia.htm</ref> Giardia is often asymptomatic, and is extremely common among the general population, with about one third of toddlers in the US being infected. The incubation period is about a week, so any symptomatic infection occurring during a weekend backpacking trip would have to have been acquired before the trip.<ref name="Zell1992" />
