'''Amphetamine''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], contracted from alphamethyl-phenethylamine or '''α-methylphenethylamine''') is 1-phenylpropan-2-amine or C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>13</sub>N.  Also called '''amfetamine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]).  It is a [[psychostimulant]] [[Medication|drug]] of the [[phenethylamine]] class that produces increased [[wakefulness]] and [[Attention|focus]] in association with decreased [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and [[appetite]]. 

Brand names of medications that contain, or metabolize into, amphetamine include [[Adderall]], [[Dexedrine]], [[Dextroamphetamine|Dextroamphet]], [[Dextrostat]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Craig Medical Distribution |url=http://www.craigmedical.com/drug_test_faq.htm |title=Drug Test FAQ &#124; Craig Medical Distribution, Inc |publisher=Craigmedical.com |date= |accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref> [[benzphetamine|Didrex]], [[dextroamphetamine|ProCentra]], and [[Vyvanse]], as well as [[Benzedrine]] or [[Psychedrine]] in the past.

Amphetamine’s well-documented short-term effects on dopamine and norepinephrine systems in the brain include resistance to fatigue, elevation of mood, heightened libido, euphoria and loss of appetite.  Repeated high-dose exposure can lead to a mental state characterized by delusions and [[paranoia]] that is indistinguishable from a [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] psychotic episode.  The effects of amphetamines on [[serotonin]] transmission may contribute to hallucinations, appetite suppression as well as [[hyperthermia]].<ref>Trevor AJ, Katzung BG, Kruidering-Hall MM, Masters SB.

PMID 11459929</ref>

The drug is also abused [[Recreational drug use|recreationally]] and as a [[performance enhancer]], and is chemically related to [[methamphetamine]] ("meth").

Important side effects of therapeutic amphetamine include stunted growth in young people and occasionally a psychosis can occur at therapeutic doses during chronic therapy.<ref name="Berman-2009"/> When used at high doses the risk of experiencing side effects and their severity increases.

===Withdrawal effects===
Withdrawal symptoms of amphetamine consist primarily of mental [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], mental [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and increased [[appetite]]. Symptoms may last for days with occasional use and weeks or months with chronic use, with severity dependent on the length of time and the amount of amphetamine used. Withdrawal symptoms may also include [[anxiety]], [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], excessive [[sleep]], vivid or lucid [[dream]]s, deep [[REM sleep]] and [[suicidal ideation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/a/amphetamine_withdrawal/symptoms.htm#symptom_list |title=Symptoms of Amphetamine withdrawal |publisher=WrongDiagnosis.com |date=1 February 2012 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sleep.emedtv.com/dextroamphetamine/dextroamphetamine-withdrawals.html |title=eMedTV &#124; Dextroamphetamine Withdrawals |publisher=Sleep.emedtv.com |date=5 March 2007 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugabusehelp.com/drugs/dexedrine/ |title=Dexedrine Information |publisher=Drug Abuse Help |date= |accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Side effects may consist of severe weight loss, also dependence may develop during use of this drug. Smoking this specific drug may induce a higher threat of dependence for first time users. Amphetamine can also raise the heart rate to dangerous levels.

===Contraindications===
Amphetamine elevates cardiac output and blood pressure making it dangerous for use by patients with a history of [[heart disease]] or [[hypertension]]. Amphetamine can cause life-threatening complications in patients taking [[MAOI]] antidepressants. The use of amphetamine and amphetamine-like drugs is contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle [[glaucoma]] or anatomically narrow angles. Like other [[sympathomimetic]] amines, amphetamine can induce transient [[mydriasis]]. In patients with narrow angles, pupillary dilation can provoke an attack of angle-closure glaucoma. These agents should also be avoided in patients with other forms of glaucoma, as mydriasis may occasionally increase interocular pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/disease-interactions/amphetamine.html |title='&#39;Amphetamine Disease Interactions |publisher=Drugs.com |date= |accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref>

Amphetamine has been shown to pass through into breast milk. Because of this, mothers taking amphetamine are advised to avoid breastfeeding during their course of treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2004/021303s005lbl.pdf |title=ADDERALL XR capsule |accessdate=24 July 2009 |first=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] |year=2005 |format=PDF }}</ref>

===Dependence and addiction===

===Overdose===
An amphetamine overdose is rarely fatal {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} but can lead to a number of different symptoms, including [[psychosis]], [[chest pain]], and [[hypertension]].

===Psychosis===
{{Main|Stimulant psychosis}}
Abuse of amphetamines can result in a stimulant psychosis that can present as a number of psychotic disorders (e.g. [[paranoia]], [[hallucination]]s, [[delusion]]s). In an Australian study of 309 active amphetamine users, 18% had experienced a clinical level psychosis in the past year.<ref name="McKetin">{{cite journal | author = McKetin R, McLaren J, Lubman DI, Hides L | year = 2006 | title = The prevalence of psychotic symptoms among methamphetamine users | url = | journal = Addiction | volume = 101 | issue = 10| pages = 1473–8 }}</ref> A Japanese study reported a 64% recovery rate within 10 days rising to a 82% recovery rate at 30 days after amphetamine cessation.<ref name="Sato">{{cite journal | author = Sato M, Numachi Y, Hamamura T | year = 1992 | title = Relapse of paranoid psychotic state in methamphetamine model of schizophrenia | url = | journal = Schizophrenia Bulletin | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = 115–22 }}</ref> However it has been suggested that about 5-15% of users fail to make a complete recovery from the psychosis in the long term.<ref name="Hoffman">Hofmann FG.

===Cardiac===
Amphetamines have been shown to increase both systolic and diastolic [[blood pressure]], and act as [[myocardium|myocardial]] stimulants when administered orally. Some individuals may experience a [[Vasovagal response|reflexive slowing]] of heart rate, but at large doses [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|arrhythmias]] have been noted. [[Cardiac output]] is generally not affected.<ref name="Westfall, David P. 2013">Westfall, David P., Westfall, Thomas, C. “Adrenergic Agonist and Antagonists”.

===Renal===
Renal failure may occur secondarily to the dehydration and [[rhabdomyolysis]] that can result from acute amphetamine toxicity. Dehydration and compromised renal function can further cause fluctuations in fluid and electrolytes, particularly potassium.<ref>Knoben, J.E. and P.O. Anderson (eds.)

Dilation of renal vasculature, along with an increase in heart contractility, increases an individual’s risk of [[Shock (circulatory)|cardiogenic shock]].<ref name="Westfall, David P. 2013"/>

===Respiratory===
Amphetamines stimulate the [[Medulla oblongata|medullary]] [[respiratory centers]], which increases the rate of respiration and produces deeper breaths. In a normal individual, amphetamines do not noticeably increase the rate of respiration or produce deeper breaths, but when respiration is already compromised, amphetamines may stimulate respiration. Prior treatment with [[reserpine]] or [[guanethidine]] prevents the pulmonary effects of amphetamines.<ref name="Westfall, David P. 2013"/> Chronic use of amphetamines can cause [[pulmonary hypertension]].<ref>Albertson, Timothy E. “Amphetamines”.

==Mechanism of action==

===Primary sites of action===
[[File:Amphetamine2.png|thumb|Ball-and-stick model of amphetamine]]
Amphetamine exerts its behavioral effects by modulating several key neurotransmitters in the brain, including [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]], and [[norepinephrine]]. However, the activity of amphetamine throughout the brain appears to be site-specific;<ref name="JonesKornblum">{{cite journal |author=Jones S, Kornblum JL, Kauer JA |title=Amphetamine blocks long-term synaptic depression in the ventral tegmental area |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=20 |issue=15 |pages=5575–80 |year=2000 |month=August |pmid=10908593 |doi= |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10908593}}</ref> certain receptors that respond to amphetamine in some regions of the brain tend not to do so in other regions. For instance, [[dopamine]] [[Dopamine receptor|D2 receptors]] in the [[hippocampus]], a region of the brain associated with forming new memories, appear to be unaffected by the presence of amphetamine.<ref name="JonesKornblum" />

The major neural systems affected by amphetamine are largely implicated in the brain’s reward circuitry. Moreover, neurotransmitters involved in various reward pathways of the brain appear to be the primary targets of amphetamine.<ref name="pmid17437">{{cite journal |author=Moore KE |title=The actions of amphetamine on neurotransmitters: a brief review |journal=Biol. Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=451–62 |year=1977 |month=June |pmid=17437 |doi= |url=}}</ref> One such neurotransmitter is [[dopamine]], a chemical messenger heavily active in the [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]] and [[Mesocortical pathway|mesocortical]] reward pathways. Therefore, the anatomical components of these pathways — including the [[striatum]], the [[nucleus accumbens]], and the [[ventral striatum]] — have been found to be primary sites of amphetamine action.<ref name="DelArco">{{cite journal |author=Del Arco A, González-Mora JL, Armas VR, Mora F |title=Amphetamine increases the extracellular concentration of glutamate in striatum of the awake rat: involvement of high affinity transporter mechanisms |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=38 |issue=7 |pages=943–54 |year=1999 |month=July |pmid=10428413 |doi=10.1016/S0028-3908(99)00043-X |url=}}</ref><ref name="Drevets">{{cite journal |author=Drevets WC, Gautier C, Price JC |title=Amphetamine-induced dopamine release in human ventral striatum correlates with euphoria |journal=Biol.

The fact that amphetamine influences neurotransmitter activity specifically in regions implicated in reward provides insight into the behavioral consequences of the drug, such as the stereotyped onset of [[euphoria]].<ref name="Drevets" /> A better understanding of the specific mechanisms by which amphetamine operates may increase our ability to treat amphetamine [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] and possibly other addictions (because the brain’s reward circuitry has been widely implicated in addictions of many types).<ref>Wise, RA.

===Related endogenous compounds===
Amphetamine has been found to have several endogenous analogues; that is, molecules of a similar structure found naturally in the brain.<ref name="Sulzer">{{cite journal |author=Sulzer D, Chen TK, Lau YY, Kristensen H, Rayport S, Ewing A |title=Amphetamine redistributes dopamine from synaptic vesicles to the cytosol and promotes reverse transport |journal=J.

These molecules are thought to modulate levels of excitement and alertness, among other related affective states.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Dopamine===
The most widely studied neurotransmitter with regard to amphetamine action in the [[central nervous system]] is [[dopamine]]. All of the addictive drugs appear to enhance synaptic dopamine, including amphetamine and methamphetamine.<ref name="pmid21338876">{{Cite pmid|21338876}}</ref> Studies have shown that, in certain brain regions, amphetamine increases the concentrations of [[dopamine]] in the [[synaptic cleft]], thereby heightening the response of the post-synaptic neuron.<ref name="Kuczenski">{{cite journal |author=Kuczenski R, Segal DS |title=Effects of methylphenidate on extracellular dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine: comparison with amphetamine |journal=J.

The specific mechanisms by which amphetamine affects dopamine concentrations have been studied extensively. Currently, two major hypotheses have been proposed, which are not mutually exclusive. One theory emphasizes amphetamine’s actions on the [[Synaptic vesicle|vesicular]] level, increasing concentrations of [[dopamine]] in the [[cytosol]] of the pre-synaptic neuron.<ref name="Sulzer" /><ref name="pmid17105921">{{cite journal |author=Rothman RB, Baumann MH |title=Balance between dopamine and serotonin release modulates behavioral effects of amphetamine-type drugs |journal=Ann.

The former hypothesis is backed by studies from [[David Sulzer]]'s lab at [[Columbia University]] demonstrating that injections of amphetamine result in rapid increases of cytosolic dopamine concentrations, while the drug decreases the number of dopamine molecules inside the [[synaptic vesicle]].<ref>{{Cite pmid|7751968}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|19409267}}</ref> Amphetamine is a substrate for a specific neuronal synaptic vesicle uptake transporter called [[vesicle monoamine transporter 2|VMAT2]]. When amphetamine is taken up by [[vesicle monoamine transporter 2|VMAT2]], the vesicle releases dopamine molecules into the cytosol in exchange. The redistributed [[dopamine]] is then believed to interact with [[dopamine transporter|DAT]] to promote reverse transport.<ref name="Sulzer" /> Amphetamine and amphetamine derivatives are also weak bases that accept protons, and can collapse acidic pH gradients in the vesicles that would otherwise provide free energy for neurotransmitter accumulation: the "weak base hypothesis" of amphetamine action suggests that collapse of this free energy contributes to redistribution of dopamine from very high (molar) concentrations in the vesicles to the cytosol.<ref name="pmid21338876"/><ref>{{Cite pmid|2268433}}</ref> Calcium may be a key molecule involved in the interactions between amphetamine and VMATs.<ref name="pmid17105921"/>

The increase of cytosolic dopamine appears to trigger neurotoxicity, as dopamine readily auto-oxidizes, so that amphetamine or methamphetamine's increase in cytosolic dopamine can lead to oxidative stress in the cytosol that in turn promotes [[autophagy]]-related degradation of dopamine axons and dendrites.<ref>{{Cite pmid|12388602}}</ref>

The second hypothesis of amphetamine action on the plasma membrane dopamine transporter postulates a direct interaction between amphetamine and the [[dopamine transporter|DAT]]. The activity of [[dopamine transporter|DAT]] is believed to depend on specific phosphorylating kinases, such as [[protein kinase c]], to be specific [[PRKCB1|PKC-β]].<ref name="Overload" /> Upon phosphorylation, [[dopamine transporter|DAT]] undergoes a conformational change that results in the transport of DAT-bound [[dopamine]] from the extracellular to the intracellular environment.<ref name="Kahlig"/> In the presence of amphetamine, however, [[dopamine transporter|DAT]] has been observed to function in reverse, spitting dopamine out of the presynaptic neuron and into the [[synaptic cleft]].<ref name="Regulation" /> Thus, beyond inhibiting reuptake of [[dopamine]], amphetamine also stimulates the release of [[dopamine]] molecules into the synapse.<ref name="pmid17437"/>

In support of the above hypothesis, it has been found that [[PRKCB1|PKC-β]] inhibitors eliminate the effects of amphetamine on extracellular [[dopamine]] concentrations in the striatum of rats.<ref name="Overload" /> This data suggests that the [[PRKCB1|PKC-β]] kinase may represent a key point of interaction between amphetamine and the [[dopamine transporter|DAT]] transporter.

Additional actions of amphetamine contribute to its ability to release dopamine from neurons, including action as an inhibitor of [[monoamine oxidase]], an enzyme responsible for dopamine breakdown in the cytosol; an ability to enhance dopamine synthesis it is presumed via actions on the enzyme [[tyrosine hydroxylase]], which synthesizes the dopamine precursor [[L-DOPA]]; and some blockade of the DAT, an action that amphetamine shares with [[cocaine]].<ref>{{Cite pmid|15955613}}</ref> Due to the combination of these actions and its long half-life, amphetamine can release far more dopamine than can cocaine or other addictive drugs.<ref name="pmid21338876"/><ref>{{Cite pmid|11487614}}</ref>

Amphetamine has been found to exert similar effects on [[serotonin]] as on [[dopamine]].<ref name="JonesKauer">{{cite journal |author=Jones S, Kauer JA |title=Amphetamine depresses excitatory synaptic transmission via serotonin receptors in the ventral tegmental area |journal=J.

The interaction between amphetamine and [[serotonin]] is apparent only in particular regions of the brain, such as the [[mesocortical pathway|mesocorticolimbic projection]]. Recent studies suggest that amphetamine may indirectly alter the behavior of [[glutamatergic system|glutamatergic]] pathways extending from the [[ventral tegmental area]] to the [[prefrontal cortex]] by increasing inhibitory serotonin receptor activity on glutamatergic neurons.<ref name="JonesKauer" /> [[glutamatergic system|Glutamatergic]] pathways are strongly correlated with increased excitability at the level of the synapse. Increased extracellular concentrations of [[serotonin]] may thus modulate the excitatory activity of glutamatergic neurons.<ref name="JonesKauer" /> 

The proposed ability of amphetamine to decrease excitability of [[glutamatergic system|glutamatergic]] pathways may be of significance when considering the role of serotonin in addiction, evidence of which has been quickly accumulating.<ref name="JonesKauer" /> An additional behavioral consequence of postulated serotonergic effects of amphetamine may be alterations in the stereotyped locomotor stimulation that occurs in response to amphetamine exposure.<ref name="Kuczenski" /> Despite this, at least one study suggests that serotonergic effects are not necessary for the development of stereotypy in rodents treated with stimulants.<ref name="Kuczenski" />

===Other relevant neurotransmitters===
Several other neurotransmitters have been linked to amphetamine activity. It is well-established that amphetamine causes increased brain and blood levels of [[norepinephrine]], a neurotransmitter related to [[adrenaline]]. This is believed to occur via reuptake blockage as well as via interactions with the norepinephrine neuronal transport carrier.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Florin SM, Kuczenski R, Segal DS |title=Regional extracellular norepinephrine responses to amphetamine and cocaine and effects of clonidine pretreatment |journal=Brain Res. |volume=654 |issue=1 |pages=53–62 |year=1994 |month=August |pmid=7982098 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(94)91570-9 |url=}}</ref> Many ''[[in vitro]]'' studies have demonstrated that amphetamine binds to and inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine(noradrenaline) via [[norepinephrine transporter]] expressed on the cell membranes of primary neurons and cell-lines. In addition, amphetamine acts as a substrate for the transporter, being moved from the outside to the inside of the cell via the transporter. Once inside the cell, amphetamine can bind to [[VMAT2]] on neurotransmitter-containing vesicles and via actions that are not well-understood, amphetamine increases release of norepinephrine.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In addition, extracellular levels of [[glutamate]], the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, have been shown to increase upon exposure to amphetamine. Consistent with other findings, this effect was found in the areas of the brain implicated in reward; namely, the [[nucleus accumbens]], [[striatum]], and [[prefrontal cortex]].

The long-term effects of amphetamines use on [[neural development]] in children has not been well established.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rxlist.com/adderall-drug.htm |title=Adderall |publisher=RxList |date=4 October 2010 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref> A study in rats suggests that high-dose amphetamine use during adolescence may impair adult [[working memory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.illinois.edu/news/09/1021amphetamine.html|title=Amphetamine use in adolescence may impair adult working memory|accessdate=22 October 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091110082533/http://news.illinois.edu/news/09/1021amphetamine.html| archivedate= 10 November 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==

===Chemical properties===
[[File:Amphetamine Structural Formulae.png|thumb|300px|Structure of levo-amphetamine (left) and dextro-amphetamine (right).]]
[[File:Methamphetamines.PNG|thumb|Chart comparing the chemical structures of different [[Template:Amphetamines|amphetamine derivatives]].]]

Amphetamine is a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] compound. The [[racemic]] mixture can be divided into its optical isomers: [[levoamphetamine|levo-]] and [[dextroamphetamine|dextro-amphetamine]]. Amphetamine is the parent compound of its own structural class, comprising a broad range of psychoactive [[derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]], from [[empathogens]], [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA (3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine)]] and [[MDMA|MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine)]] known as ecstasy, to the ''N''-methylated form, [[methamphetamine]] known as 'meth', and to decongestants such as [[Ephedrine|ephedrine (EPH)]] . Amphetamine is a [[homologous series|homologue]] of [[phenethylamine]].

At first, the medical drug came as the salt racemic-amphetamine sulfate (racemic-amphetamine contains both isomers in equal amounts). Attention disorders are often treated using [[Adderall]] or a generic equivalent, a formulation of mixed amphetamine and dextroamphetamine salts that contain
* 1/4 dextro-amphetamine saccharate
* 1/4 dextro-amphetamine sulfate
* 1/4 (racemic amphetamine) aspartate monohydrate
* 1/4 (racemic amphetamine) sulfate

In organic chemistry, amphetamine was found as excellent chiral ligand for stereoselective synthesis of [[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol]].<ref>

===Pharmacodynamics===
Amphetamine has been shown to both diffuse through the cell membrane and travel via the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT) to increase concentrations of [[dopamine]] in the neuronal terminal.

Amphetamine, both as d-amphetamine ([[dextroamphetamine]]) and l-amphetamine (or a racemic mixture of the two isomers), is believed to exert its effects by binding to the monoamine transporters and increasing extracellular levels of the biogenic amines [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline) and [[serotonin]]. It is hypothesized that d-amphetamine acts primarily on the dopaminergic systems, while l-amphetamine is norepinephrinergic (noradrenergic). The primary reinforcing and behavioral-stimulant effects of amphetamine, however, are linked to enhanced dopaminergic activity, primarily in the mesolimbic [[dopamine system]].

Amphetamine and other amphetamine-type stimulants act principally to release dopamine into the [[synaptic cleft]]. Amphetamine, unlike dopamine transporter inhibitor cocaine, acts as a substrate for DAT and slows reuptake by a secondary acting mechanism through the phosphorylation of dopamine transporters.<ref>[http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:BaDklpuwbTQJ:wiki.answers.com/Q/Does_Namenda_memantine_work_in_preventing_tolerance_to_adderall_ADD_amphetamine_type_drugs&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=10&gl=us WikiAnswers google cached page: 'Does Namenda memantine work in preventing tolerance to adderall ADD amphetamine type drugs?']</ref> [[Image:Amphetamine metabolism.png|thumb|400px|Three main routes of amphetamine [[metabolism]]. Excreted proportion is marked with percentages and inactive [[metabolite]]s with pale red.]] A primary action of amphetamine is mediated by [[vesicular monoamine transporters]] (VMATs); the transporters appear to provide a channel through which dopamine and other transmitters can exit the vesicle to the cytosol. According to the "weak base hypothesis" this is exacerbated by amphetamine acting to alkalinize the vesicle, which depletes the free energy favoring vesicle accumulation so that transmitter is redistributed to the cytosol. Together, these actions cause the release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin from monoamine vesicles, thereby increasing cytosolic concentrations of transmitter. This increase in concentration assists in the "reverse transport" of dopamine via the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT) into the synapse.<ref name="review">{{cite journal |author=Sulzer D, Sonders MS, Poulsen NW, Galli A |title=Mechanisms of neurotransmitter release by amphetamines: a review |journal=Prog. Neurobiol. |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=406–33 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15955613 |doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2005.04.003 |url=}}</ref> In addition, amphetamine binds reversibly to the DATs and blocks the transporter's ability to clear DA from the synaptic space. Amphetamine also acts in this way with norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and to a lesser extent serotonin.

Amphetamine has been identified as a potent [[agonist]] of [[TAAR1]], a newly discovered [[G protein-coupled receptor|GPCR]] important for regulation of [[monoaminergic]] systems in the brain.<ref name="pmid11723224">{{cite pmid|11723224}}</ref> Activation of TAAR1 increases [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] production via [[adenylyl cyclase]] activation and inhibits transporter function.<ref name="pmid11723224"/><ref>{{cite pmid|19364908}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|11459929}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|18310473}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|17234900}}</ref> These effects increase monoamine efflux and prolong the amount of time monoamines remain in the synapse.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The [[Biological half-life|half-life]] of amphetamines varies with age and [[stereochemistry]]. The dextrarotary amphetamine (D; also d and S) is processed faster than the levarotary amphetamine (L; also l and R) form. In adults, the half-life for the D-form is 10 hours and the L-form is 13 hours. For ages 13–17, the half-life is (D:L) 11:13-14hrs. For children 9–12 years of age the half-life of the drug is (D:L) 9:11.

Metabolism occurs mostly in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) detoxification system. The isoenzymes [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP2D6]], [[CYP3A4]] along with [[Flavin-containing monooxygenase|flavin monooxygenases]] are the primary metabolic enzymes. Deamination of amphetamine into [[phenylacetone]] (an inert metabolite) is performed by CYP2C. Other breakdown pathways in the liver include dealkylation and demethylation. These produce a variety excreted metabolic products, some of which are also biologically active, including [[Hydroxyamfetamine|parahydroxyamphetamine]], [[hippuric acid]], [[Phenylpropanolamine|norephedrine]] and p-hydroxynorephedrine.

Amphetamine is eliminated renally with 70% of the drug being cleared in 24 hours, with a fraction of the drug being excreted unchanged (.21-.45). This process is dependent on urinary pH. Amphetamine is a weak base with a [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa of 9-10]]. Consequently, when the urinary pH is basic, more of the drug is in its free base form and less is excreted. Apparent half-life and duration of effect increase with repeated use and accumulation of drug.<ref>Shargel, Leon; Wu-Pong, Susanna; Yu, Andrew B.C.

==History==
Amphetamine was first synthesized in 1887 by the [[Romania]]n chemist [[Lazăr Edeleanu]] in [[Berlin|Berlin, Germany]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Edeleano L | title = Ueber einige Derivate der Phenylmethacrylsäure und der Phenylisobuttersäure | journal = Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft | volume = 20 | issue=1 | pages = 616–622 | year = 1887 | doi = 10.1002/cber.188702001142 }}

From 1933 or 1934 [[Smith, Kline and French]] began selling the volatile base form of the drug as an [[inhaler]] under the [[trade name]] [[Benzedrine]], useful as a decongestant but readily usable for other purposes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rasmussen N |title=Making the first anti-depressant: amphetamine in American medicine, 1929–1950 |journal=J Hist Med Allied Sci |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=288–323 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16492800 |doi=10.1093/jhmas/jrj039 |url=}}</ref> One of the first attempts at using amphetamine as a scientific study was done by M. H. Nathanson, a Los Angeles physician, in 1935. He studied the subjective effects of amphetamine in 55 hospital workers who were each given 20&nbsp;mg of Benzedrine. The two most commonly reported drug effects were "a sense of well being and a feeling of exhilaration" and "lessened fatigue in reaction to work".<ref>Iverson, Leslie. Speed, Ecstasy, Ritalin: the science of amphetamines. Oxford, New York. Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref> During World War II amphetamine was extensively used to combat fatigue and increase alertness in soldiers. After decades of reported abuse, the [[United States Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] banned Benzedrine inhalers, and limited amphetamine to prescription use in 1965, but non-medical use remained common. Amphetamine became a schedule II drug in the USA under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] in 1971.

The related compound [[methamphetamine]], in its crystallized form, was first synthesized from [[ephedrine]] in [[Japan]] in 1920 by chemist [[Akira Ogata]], via reduction of ephedrine using [[red phosphorus]] and [[iodine]]. The pharmaceutical [[Pervitin]] was a tablet of {{nowrap|3 mg}} methamphetamine that was available in Germany from 1938 and widely used in the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'', but by mid-1941 it became a controlled substance, despite this new classification, methamphetamine and the cocaine-derivative referred to as "Codename D-IX" were distributed by military doctors across both the Western and Eastern theatres of war. During the course of the war over 200 million [[Pervitin]] pills were prescribed to Wehrmacht combatants.<ref>{{cite book |last= Rasmussen |first= Nicolas |authorlink= |title= On Speed: The Many Lives of Amphetamine |year= 2008 |publisher= New York University Press |location= New York, New York |isbn= 0-8147-7601-9 |chapter= Ch. 4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/nazis-secret-weapon-they-were-all-high/story-e6frfkyi-1226032409117 |title=Nazis Secret Weapon: They were all high |publisher=http://www.news.com.au |date=2 April 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref>

===Detection in body fluids===
Amphetamine is frequently measured in urine as part of a [[drug test]], in plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims, or in whole blood to assist in the forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a case of sudden death. Techniques such as [[immunoassay]] may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs, so chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine should be employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether obtained legally (via prescription) or illicitly, or possibly as a result of formation from a prodrug such as lisdexamfetamine or selegiline. Chiral separation is needed to assess the possible contribution of l-methamphetamine (Vicks Inhaler) toward a positive test result.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Verstraete AG, Heyden FV |title=Comparison of the sensitivity and specificity of six immunoassays for the detection of amphetamines in urine |journal=J Anal Toxicol |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=359–64 |year=2005 |pmid=16105261 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Paul BD, Jemionek J, Lesser D, Jacobs A, Searles DA |title=Enantiomeric separation and quantitation of (+/-)-amphetamine, (+/-)-methamphetamine, (+/-)-MDA, (+/-)-MDMA, and (+/-)-MDEA in urine specimens by GC-EI-MS after derivatization with (R)-(-)- or (S)-(+)-alpha-methoxy-alpha-(trifluoromethy)phenylacetyl chloride (MTPA) |journal=J Anal Toxicol |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=449–55 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15516295 |doi= 10.1093/jat/28.6.449|url=}}</ref><ref>R.

It has been commonly used by [[mod (subculture)|mods]], [[skinheads]], [[punk subculture|punks]], [[Goth subculture|goths]], gangsters, and [[casuals]] in all night soul and ska dances, punk concerts, [[basement show]]s and [[football hooliganism|fighting on the terraces]] by casuals. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The [[hippie]] [[counterculture]] was very critical of amphetamines due to the behaviors they cause; in an interview with the [[Los Angeles Free Press]] in 1965, beat writer [[Allen Ginsberg]] commented that "Speed is antisocial, paranoid making, it's a drag... all the nice gentle dope fiends are getting screwed up by the real horror monster Frankenstein speed freaks who are going round stealing and bad-mouthing everybody".<ref>{{cite web

===In literature===
The writers of the [[Beat Generation]] used amphetamine extensively, mainly under the [[Benzedrine]] [[brand name]]. [[Jack Kerouac]] was a particularly avid user of amphetamine, which was said to provide him with the stamina needed to work on his novels for extended periods of time.<ref>{{cite web

Scottish author [[Irvine Welsh]] often portrays drug use in his novels, though in one of his journalism works he comments on how drugs (including amphetamine) have become part of consumerism and how his novels [[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]] and [[Porno (novel)|Porno]] reflect the changes in drug use and culture during the years that elapse between the two texts.<ref>

Amphetamine is frequently mentioned in the work of American journalist [[Hunter S. Thompson]]. Speed not only appears among the inventory of drugs Thompson consumed for what could broadly be defined as recreational purposes but also receives frequent, explicit mention as an essential component of his writing toolkit,<ref>{{cite news

<!--I think this quote is too long, I propose cutting it: -->
<blockquote>"One afternoon about three days ago [the publishers] showed up at my door with no warning, and loaded about forty pounds of supplies into the room: two cases of Mexican beer, four quarts of gin, a dozen grapefruits, and enough speed to alter the outcome of six [[Super Bowl]]s. ... Meanwhile, <!--start cut here --[my room at the Seal Rock Inn is [now] filling up with people who seem on the verge of hysteria at the sight of me still sitting here wasting time on a rambling introduction], <!-- end cut -->[...] with the final chapter still unwritten and the presses scheduled to start rolling in twenty-four hours . . . . <!--cut [but] --> unless somebody shows up pretty soon with extremely powerful speed, there might not ''be'' a final chapter. About four fingers of king-hell Crank would do the trick, but I am not optimistic."
</blockquote>

===In music===
Many songs have been written about amphetamine, for example in the track entitled "[[St. Ides Heaven]]" from singer/songwriter, [[Elliott Smith]]'s self-titled album. ''[[Semi Charmed Life]]'' by Third Eye Blind also references amphetamine. Another blatant example would be the song simply labelled "Amphetamine" by Alternative rock band [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]], the song "20 Dollar nose bleed" by the Pop-rock band [[Fall Out Boy]], and the song "[[Headfirst For Halos]]" by [[My Chemical Romance]]. It has also influenced the aesthetics of many rock'n'roll bands (especially in the [[garage rock]], mod R&B, [[death rock]], punk/hardcore, [[gothic rock]] and extreme heavy metal genres). [[Hüsker Dü]], [[Jesus and Mary Chain]] and [[The Who]] were keen amphetamine users early in their existence. [[Hollywood Undead]] references the drug as a negative effect in the song "City" off their breakout album ''[[Swan Songs (Hollywood Undead album)|Swan Songs]]''. ''[[Land Speed Record (album)|Land Speed Record]]'' is an allusion to Hüsker Dü's amphetamine use. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Amphetamine was widely abused in the 1980s underground punk-rock scene. Punk-rock band NOFX have incorporated references to Amphetamines and other stimulants, the two most obvious being the song "Three on Speed" from the "Surfer" 8" LP (in reference to the three guys being on Amphetamine while recording the album), and earlier the album "The Longest Line" is in reference to a "line" of Amphetamine ready for insufflation.
[[The Rolling Stones]] referenced the drug in their song "Can't You Hear Me Knocking" on the album ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' ("Y'all got cocaine eyes / Yeah, ya got speed-freak jive now"). [[Lou Reed]] refers explicitly to the drug on his album ''[[Berlin (album)|Berlin]]'', in the song "How Do You Think It Feels?". Reed's band [[The Velvet Underground]], a creation of [[Andy Warhol]]'s Factory Years, was fueled by amphetamines, as well as naming their second album ''[[White Light/White Heat]]'' after the drug and making reference to the song in "[[Sister Ray]].". The [[pulp (band)|Pulp]] song ''[[Sorted for E's & Wizz]]'' refers to British slang terms for [[MDMA|ecstasy]] and amphetamines. English [[gothic rock]] band [[The Sisters of Mercy]] refers to the drug in their song "Amphetamine Logic" from their first album, ''[[First and Last and Always]]'', and their singer [[Andrew Eldritch]] used amphetamines repeatedly. The Byrds referenced amphetamines in the 1968 song "Artificial Energy" on the album "The Notorious Byrd Brothers."

Many rock'n'roll bands have named themselves after amphetamine and drug slang surrounding it. For example [[Mod revival]]ists, [[Purple Hearts (UK band)|The Purple Hearts]] named themselves after the amphetamine tablets popular with mods during the 1960s, as did the Australian band of the same name during the mid-1960s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The Amphetameanies, a ska-punk band, are also named after amphetamine, but also imitate its effects.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}{{vague|date=January 2013}} [[Dexys Midnight Runners]], of number one hit "[[Come On Eileen]]", are named after [[Dexedrine]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} [[Motörhead]] derived their name from the song of the same name, originally by Hawkwind where Ian "Lemmy" Kilmister was on bass before leaving to form Motörhead.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Lemmy Kilmister is a long-term user of speed.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The [[Northern Soul]] scene, an offshoot of the [[Mod (subculture)|mod scene]], involved people taking amphetamines to keep dancing all night. One DJ, Roger Eagle, got out of the [[Northern Soul]] scene saying: "All they wanted was fast-tempo black dance music... [but they were] too blocked on amphetamines to articulate exactly which Jackie Wilson record they wanted me to play."<ref>Keith Rylatt and Phil Scott, ''Central 1179: The Story of Manchester's Twisted Wheel Club'', BeeCool Publishing. 2001</ref>

[[Danny Brown (rapper)|Danny Brown]]'s album [[XXX (Danny Brown album)|XXX]] contains many references to Adderall with such tracks such as Adderall Admiral.

===In film===
<!-- In order to include a fictional reference about amphetamines, please explain the subject's impact on popular culture rather than simply listing appearances. Trivial and irrelevant items will be removed! -->
Producer [[David O. Selznick]] was an amphetamine user, and would often dictate long and rambling memos under the influence of amphetamine to his directors.<ref>''Memo From David O. Selznick'', http://www.amazon.com/Memo-David-Selznick-Memorandums-Autobiographical/dp/0375755314</ref> The documentary ''Shadowing The Third Man'' relates that Selznick introduced [[The Third Man]] director [[Carol Reed]] to the use of amphetamine, which allowed Reed to bring the picture in below budget and on schedule by filming nearly 22 hours at a time.<ref>''Shadowing the Third Man'', http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0429086/</ref>

The title of the 2009 movie ''[[Amphetamine (2009 film)|Amphetamine]]'' plays on the double meaning of the word in Chinese - besides the name for the drug it also means 'isn't this his fate?' which figuratively ties to the movie's plot. The word is [[Transcription into Chinese characters|transliterated]] as [[wikt:安|安]] [[wikt:非|非]] [[wikt:他|他]] [[wikt:命|命]] - "[[wikt:ān|ān]] [[wikt:fēi|fēi]] [[wikt:tā|tā]] [[wikt:mìng|mìng]]" - and as commonly happens with transliteration of non-Chinese terms each character has independent meaning as an individual unrelated word.

===In mathematics===
One of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, [[Paul Erdős]], took amphetamines after the age of 58 until his death at the age of 83 (he had previously sustained himself on copious amounts of coffee).  He took amphetamines despite the concern of his friends, one of whom ([[Ronald Graham|Ron Graham]]) bet him $500 that he could not stop taking the drug for a month.<ref>Hill, J. [http://www.untruth.org/~josh/math/Paul%20Erd%F6s%20bio-rev2.pdf Paul Erdos, Mathematical Genius, Human (In That Order)]</ref> Erdős won the bet, but complained that during his abstinence mathematics had been set back by a month: "Before, when I looked at a piece of blank paper my mind was filled with ideas. Now all I see is a blank piece of paper." After he won the bet, he promptly resumed his amphetamine use.
