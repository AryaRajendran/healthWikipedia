'''Dyspepsia''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] δυσ- ''[[dys-]]'' and πέψις ''pepsis'' "digestion"), also known as '''indigestion''', is a condition of impaired [[digestion]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000033170|dyspepsia}}</ref> It is a  medical condition characterized by chronic or recurrent [[pain]] in the upper [[abdomen]], upper abdominal fullness and feeling full earlier than expected when eating.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Talley NJ, Vakil N |title=Guidelines for the management of dyspepsia |journal=Am.

==Signs and symptoms==
The characteristic symptoms of dyspepsia are upper abdominal pain, bloating, fullness and tenderness on [[palpation]].{{citation needed|date=May 2008}}  Pain worsened by exertion and associated with [[nausea]] and [[perspiration]] may also indicate [[angina]].{{citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Occasionally dyspeptic symptoms are caused by medication, such as [[calcium antagonist]]s (used for [[angina]] or [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]), nitrates (used for angina), [[theophylline]] (used for chronic lung disease), [[bisphosphonate]]s, [[corticosteroid]]s and [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs, used as painkillers).<ref name=NICE/>

The presence of [[gastrointestinal bleeding]] (vomit containing blood), [[dysphagia|difficulty swallowing]], loss of appetite, unintentional weight loss, abdominal swelling and persistent [[vomiting]] are suggestive of peptic ulcer disease or malignancy, and would necessitate urgent investigations.<ref name=NICE/>

==Diagnosis==
People under 55 years without alarm symptoms can be treated without investigation.  People over 55 years with recent onset dyspepsia or those with alarm symptoms should be urgently investigated by [[upper gastrointestinal endoscopy]]. This will rule out peptic ulcer disease, medication-related ulceration, malignancy and other rarer causes.<ref name=NICE/>

People under the age of 55 years with no alarm features do not need endoscopy but are considered for investigation for peptic ulcer disease caused by ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' [[infection]]. Investigation for ''H. pylori'' infection is usually performed when there is a moderate to high prevalence of this infection in the local community or the person with dyspepsia has other risk factors for ''H. pylori'' infection, related for example to ethnicity or immigration from a high-prevalence area. If infection is confirmed it can usually be eradicated by medication.

Medication-related dyspepsia is usually related to [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) and can be complicated by bleeding or ulceration with perforation of stomach wall.

==Treatment==
Functional and undifferentiated dyspepsia have similar treatments. Decisions around the use of drug therapy are difficult because trials included heartburn in the definition of dyspepsia. This led to the results favoring [[proton pump inhibitors]] (PPIs), which are effective for the treatment of heartburn. Traditional therapies used for this diagnosis include lifestyle modification, antacids, [[h2-receptor antagonist|H2-receptor antagonists (H2-RAs)]], [[prokinetic]] agents, and [[antiflatulent]]s.  It  has been noted that one of the most frustrating aspects of treating functional dyspepsia is that these traditional agents have been shown to have little or no efficacy.<ref name="Monkemuller">{{cite journal |author=Mönkemüller K, Malfertheiner P |title=Drug treatment of functional dyspepsia |journal=World J.

Antacids and [[sucralfate]] were found to be no better than placebo in a literature review.<ref name="ACG Guidelines">{{cite journal |author=Talley NJ, Vakil N |title=Guidelines for the management of dyspepsia |journal=Am.

A 2002 systemic review of herbal products found that several herbs, including [[peppermint]] and [[caraway]], have anti-dyspeptic effects for non-ulcer dyspepsia with "encouraging safety profiles".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thompson Coon J, Ernst E |title=Systematic review: herbal medicinal products for non-ulcer dyspepsia |journal=Aliment.

Currently, PPIs are, depending on the specific drug, FDA indicated for erosive [[esophagitis]], gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), [[Zollinger-Ellison syndrome]], eradication of H. pylori, duodenal and gastric ulcers, and NSAID-induced ulcer healing and prevention, but not functional dyspepsia.  There are, however, evidence-based guidelines and literature that evaluate the use of PPIs for this indication.  A helpful chart summarizing the major trials is available from the functional dyspepsia guidelines published in the World Journal of Gastroenterology in 2006.<ref name="Monkemuller"/>
 
The CADET study was the first to compare a PPI (omeprazole 20&nbsp;mg daily) to both an H2-RA (ranitidine 150&nbsp;mg BID) as well as a prokinetic agent (cisapride 20&nbsp;mg BID) alongside placebo.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Veldhuyzen van Zanten SJ, Chiba N, Armstrong D, ''et al.'' |title=A randomized trial comparing omeprazole, ranitidine, cisapride, or placebo in helicobacter pylori negative, primary care patients with dyspepsia: the CADET-HN Study |journal=Am. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=100 |issue=7 |pages=1477–88 |year=2005 |pmid=15984968 |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2005.40280.x |url=}}</ref>  The study evaluated these agents in patients at 4 weeks and 6 months and noted that omeprazole had a significantly better response at 6 months (31%) than cisapride (13%) or placebo (14%) (p = .001) while it was just above the cutoff for being statistically significantly better than ranitidine (21%) (p = .053).  Omeprazole also showed a significant increase in quality of life scores over the other agents and placebo in all but one category measured (p = .01 to .05).

The ENCORE study, which was a follow-up of patients from the OPERA study, showed responders to omeprazole therapy had fewer clinic visits than non-responders (1.5 vs 2.0) over a three-month period (p < .001).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Talley NJ, Meineche-Schmidt V, Paré P, ''et al.'' |title=Efficacy of omeprazole in functional dyspepsia: double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (the Bond and Opera studies) |journal=Aliment.

=== ''H. pylori'' connection ===

The relationship between ''[[H. pylori]]'' and functional dyspepsia has been controversial, with several trials finding a benefit and others finding no benefit; a 2003 [[Cochrane Collaboration]] review found that treating H. pylori did have a small effect in improving nonulcer dyspepsia symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moayyedi P, Deeks J, Talley NJ, Delaney B, Forman D |title=An update of the Cochrane systematic review of Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy in nonulcer dyspepsia: resolving the discrepancy between systematic reviews |journal=Am.

More recently, "[[Helicobacter pylori]] eradication provided significant benefits to primary care patients with functional dyspepsia." according to a [[randomized controlled trial]].<ref name="pmid22123802">{{cite journal| author=Mazzoleni LE, Sander GB, Francesconi CF, Mazzoleni F, Uchoa DM, De Bona LR et al.| title=Helicobacter pylori eradication in functional dyspepsia: HEROES trial. | journal=Arch Intern Med | year= 2011 | volume= 171 | issue= 21 | pages= 1929–36 | pmid=22123802 | doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2011.533}}</ref> In this trial, the [[relative benefit ratio]] of [[Helicobacter pylori]] eradication for 50% reduction in symptoms at 12 months was 1.3 and, the [[relative benefit increase]] was 34.3%.
