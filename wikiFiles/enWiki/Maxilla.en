The '''maxilla''' ({{IPAc-en|m|æ|k|ˈ|s|ɪ|l|ə}};<ref name="OED 2nd edition, 1989">''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989.</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/maxilla Entry "maxilla"] in ''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]''.</ref> plural: ''maxillae'' {{IPAc-en|m|æ|k|ˈ|s|ɪ|l|iː}})<ref name="OED 2nd edition, 1989"/> is a fusion of two bones along the [[palate|palatal]] fissure that form the upper [[jaw]]. This is similar to the mandible (lower jaw), which is also a fusion of two halves at the mandibular symphysis. Sometimes (e.g. in bony fish), the maxilla is called "upper maxilla," with the mandible being the "lower maxilla." Conversely, in birds the upper jaw is often called "upper mandible."

==Function==
The [[alveolar process]] of the maxilla holds the upper teeth, and is referred to as the maxillary arch. The maxilla attaches laterally to the [[zygomatic bone]]s (cheek bones).

The maxilla assists in forming the boundaries of three cavities:
* the roof of the [[mouth]]
* the floor and lateral wall of the [[nasal antrum]]
* the wall of the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]

The maxilla also enters into the formation of two fossae: the [[Infratemporal fossa|infratemporal]] and [[Pterygopalatine fossa|pterygopalatine]], and two [[fissures]], the [[inferior orbital]] and [[pterygomaxillary]].

==Components==
Each half of the fused maxilla consists of:

* The [[body of the maxilla]]
* Four processes
** The [[Zygomatic process of maxilla|zygomatic process]]
** The [[frontal process of maxilla]]
** The [[alveolar process]]
** The [[palatine process]]
* [[Infraorbital foramen]]
* The [[maxillary sinus]]

== Articulations ==
The maxilla articulates with nine bones:
* two of the [[Human cranium|cranium]]: the [[Frontal bone|frontal]] and [[ethmoid]]
* seven of the [[face]]: the [[nasal bone|nasal]], [[zygomatic bone|zygomatic]], [[lacrimal bone|lacrimal]], [[inferior nasal concha]], [[Palatine bone|palatine]], [[vomer]], and the adjacent fused maxillary bone.

Sometimes it articulates with the orbital surface, and sometimes with the [[lateral pterygoid plate]] of the [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]].

==In other animals==
In most vertebrates, the foremost part of the upper jaw, to which the [[incisor]]s are attached in mammals consists of a separate pair of bones, the [[premaxilla]]e. These fuse with the maxilla proper to form the bone found in humans, and some other mammals. In [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]], [[amphibian]]s, and [[reptile]]s, both maxilla and premaxilla are relatively plate-like bones, forming only the sides of the upper jaw, and part of the face, with the premaxilla also forming the lower boundary of the [[nostril]]s. However, in mammals, the bones have curved inward, creating the palatine process and thereby also forming part of the roof of the mouth.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 217–243|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>

[[Bird]]s do not have a maxilla in the strict sense; the corresponding part of their [[beak]]s (mainly consisting of the premaxilla) is called "upper mandible."

[[Chondrichthyes|Cartilaginous fish]], such as sharks also lack a true maxilla. Their upper jaw is instead formed from a [[cartilage]]nous bar that is not [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the bone found in other vertebrates.<ref name=VB/>
