The '''Empiric school''' of [[medicine]] (''Empirics'', ''Empiricists'', or ''Empirici'', {{lang-el|Ἐμπειρικοί}}) was an ancient school of medicine in [[Ancient Greek medicine|ancient Greece]] and [[Medicine in ancient Rome|Rome]]. They were so called from the word ''empeiria'' (ἐμπειρία "experience") because they professed to derive their knowledge from ''experiences'' only, and in doing so set themselves in opposition to the [[Dogmatic school]]. [[Serapion of Alexandria]], and [[Philinus of Cos]], are regarded as the founders of this school in the 3rd century BC. Among the other physicians who belonged to this sect there were: [[Apollonius of Citium]], [[Glaucias (physician)|Glaucias]], [[Heraclides of Tarentum|Heraclides]], [[Bacchius of Tanagra|Bacchius]], [[Zeuxis of Tarentum|Zeuxis]], [[Menodotus of Nicomedia|Menodotus]], [[Theodas of Laodicea|Theodas]], [[Herodotus (physician)|Herodotus of Tarsus]], [[Aeschrion of Pergamon|Aeschrion]], [[Sextus Empiricus]], and [[Marcellus Empiricus]]. The sect survived a long time, as Marcellus lived in the 4th century. The doctrines of this school are described by [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] in the introduction to his ''[[De Medicina]]''.

==Doctrines==
The Empiric school said that is was necessary to understand the ''evident causes'' of disease, but considered the inquiry after the ''hidden causes'' and ''natural actions'' to be fruitless, because [[Nature]] is incomprehensible. That these things cannot be understood appears from the controversies among [[philosopher]]s and [[physician]]s, and in the way in which the methods of practice differed from place to place, one method being used in [[Rome]], another in [[Egypt]], and another in [[Gaul]]. Often too, the causes are evident; as in a [[wound]], and if the evident cause does not suggest a method of curing, then much less so other obscure methods. This being the case, it is much better to seek relief from things certain and tried; that is, from remedies as learned from experience.

They said that medicine, in its infancy, was deduced from [[experiments]]; for the sick, in a time when there were no physicians, had either taken [[food]] in the first days of their illness, or had abstained, and that the illness was more quickly alleviated in one group than the other. This and other instances occurring daily were observed by people diligent enough to realize which method was best to cure particular conditions, and hence the art of medicine arose. Medicine was not invented in consequence of [[reason]]ing, but that [[theory]] was sought after the discovery of medicine.

They asked, too, whether reason prescribed the same as experience, or something different: if the same, then it is not necessary; if different, then mischievous. Initially there was a necessity to examine [[cure|remedies]] with the greatest accuracy, but now they are sufficiently ascertained; there are no new diseases, and hence no need for any novel methods of healing. If a patient had an unknown type of [[illness]], the physician would not recourse to obscure knowledge, but would see what type of illness was most nearly allied, and to make a trial of the medicines used to treat the allied condition.

What matters is not what causes, but what cures the condition. It does not matter why a concoction works, only that it does work. Nor is it necessary to know how we [[breathing|breathe]], but what relieves difficult breathing. Likewise we should not seek the cause of motion in the [[arteries]], but what each kind of motion indicates. These things are known by experience. There is no value in [[dissect]]ing dead bodies, since the state of the organs are very different in dead bodies compared to living ones.

They supported their opinions in favour of experience with the famous "''Tripod of Medicine''":
*'''Observation''': The observations which the [[patient]] had made in the course of the illness. concerning the course of the disease and results of any treatments.
*'''History''': A written collection of observations made by others.
*'''Analogy''': When treating a new illness, selecting a plan of treatment by comparing it with a known disease which most resembled it.
