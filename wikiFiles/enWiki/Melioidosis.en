'''Melioidosis''' is an [[infectious disease]] caused by a [[Gram-negative]] [[bacterium]], ''[[Burkholderia pseudomallei]]'', found in [[soil]] and water. It is of public health importance in endemic areas, particularly in Thailand and northern Australia. It exists in acute and chronic forms. Symptoms may include pain in chest, bones, or joints; cough; skin infections, lung [[Nodule (medicine)|nodule]]s and pneumonia.

''B. pseudomallei'' was previously classed as part of the ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' genus and until 1992, it was known as ''Pseudomonas pseudomallei''. It is phylogenetically related closely to ''[[Burkholderia mallei]]'' which causes [[glanders]], an infection primarily of horses, donkeys and mules. The name Melioidosis is derived from the Greek ''melis'' (μηλις) meaning "a distemper of asses" with the suffixes -oid meaning  "similar to" and -osis meaning "a condition", that is, a condition similar to glanders.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stanton AT, Fletcher W|chapter=Melioidosis, a new disease of the tropics|title=Far Eastern Association of Tropical Medicine: Transactions of the Fourth Congress|location=Batavia, Dutch East Indies|publisher=Javasche Boekhandel en Drukkerij|year=1921}}</ref>

There is a wide spectrum of severity; in chronic presentations, symptoms may last months, but [[fulminant]] infection, particularly associated with near-drowning, may present with severe symptoms over hours.

A patient with active melioidosis usually presents with fever. Pain or other symptoms may be suggestive of a clinical focus, which is found in around 75% of patients. Such symptoms include cough or pleuritic chest pain suggestive of [[pneumonia]], bone or joint pain suggestive of osteomyelitis or septic arthritis, or cellulitis.

==Diagnosis==
A definitive diagnosis is made by culturing the organism from any clinical sample, because the organism is never part of the normal human flora.

A definite history of contact with soil may not be elicited as melioidosis can be dormant for many years before manifesting.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ngauy V, Lemeshev Y, Sadkowski L, Crawford G|title=Cutaneous Melioidosis in a Man Who Was Taken as a Prisoner of War by the Japanese during World War II|journal=J Clin Microbiol|year=2005|volume=43|pmid=15695721|issue=2|pages= 970&ndash;972|pmc=548040|doi=10.1128/JCM.43.2.970-972.2005}}</ref> Attention should be paid to a history of travel to endemic areas in returned travellers. Some authors recommend considering possibility of melioidosis in every febrile patient with a history of traveling to and/or staying at endemic areas.

A complete screen (blood culture, [[sputum]] culture, urine culture, throat swab and culture of any aspirated pus) should be performed on all patients with suspected melioidosis (culture on [[blood agar]] as well as [[Ashdown's medium]]). A definitive diagnosis is made by growing ''B. pseudomallei'' from any site.  A throat swab is not sensitive but is 100% specific if positive, and compares favourably with sputum culture.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Wuthiekanun V, Suputtamongkol Y, Simpson AJH, Kanaphun P, White NJ|title=Value of Throat Swab in Diagnosis of Melioidosis|journal=J Clin Microbiol|year=2001|volume=39|pages=3801&ndash;02 | doi=10.1128/JCM.39.10.3801-3802.2001|pmid=11574624 | issue=10 | pmc=88440

===Surgical treatment===
Surgical drainage is usually indicated for prostatic abscesses and septic arthritis, may be indicated for parotid abscesses and not usually indicated for hepatosplenic abscesses. In bacteraemic melioidosis unresponsive to intravenous antibiotic therapy, splenectomy has been attempted, but there is only anecdotal evidence to support this practice.<ref>{{cite journal|author= TJ Inglis, CL Golledge, A Clair, and J Harvey|title=Case report: recovery from persistent septicemic melioidosis|journal=Am J Trop Med Hyg|volume=65|issue=1|year=2001|pages=76&ndash;82|pmid=11504412}}</ref>

===Historical treatment===
Prior to 1989, the standard treatment for acute melioidosis was a three-drug combination of [[chloramphenicol]], [[co-trimoxazole]] and [[doxycycline]]; this regimen is associated with a mortality rate of 80% and is no longer be used unless no other alternatives are available.<ref name="CAZ"/>  All four drugs are bacteriostatic (they stop the bacterium from growing but do not kill it) and the action of co-trimoxazole antagonizes both chloramphenicol and doxycycline.<ref name="Dance2006">{{cite journal|author=Dance DA, Wuthiekanun V, Chaowagul W, White NJ|title=Interactions in vitro between agents used to treat melioidosis|journal=J Antimicrob Chemother|year=1989|volume=24|pages=311&ndash;6|pmid=2681117|doi=10.1093/jac/24.3.311|issue=3}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Without access to appropriate antibiotics (principally [[ceftazidime]] or [[meropenem]]), the septicemic form of melioidosis has a mortality rate that exceeds 90%.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Couture E|journal=Rev Hyg Méd Prèv|year=1935|volume=57|pages=190}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Warner JM, Pelowa DB, Currie BJ, Hirst RG|title=Melioidosis in a rural community of Western Province, Papua New Guinea|journal=Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg|year=2007|pmid=17499321|doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2007.02.024|volume=101|pages=809–13|issue=8}}</ref> With appropriate antibiotics, the mortality rate is about 10% for uncomplicated cases but up to 80% for cases with bacteraemia or severe sepsis. It seems certain that access to intensive care facilities is also important, and probably at least partially explains why total mortality is 20% in Northern Australia but 40% in Northeast Thailand. Response to appropriate antibiotic treatment is slow with the average duration of fever following treatment being 5&ndash;9 days.<ref name="White2003"/><ref>{{cite journal|journal=J Infect Dis|year=1989|volume=159|issue=5|pages=890&ndash;9|title=Melioidosis: a major cause of community-acquired septicemia in northeastern Thailand|author=Chaowagul W, White NJ, Dance DA, ''et al.''|pmid=2708842|doi=10.1093/infdis/159.5.890}}</ref>

Recurrence occurs in 10 to 20% of patients. While molecular studies have established that the majority of recurrences are due to the original infecting strain, a significant proportion of recurrences (perhaps up to a quarter) in endemic areas may be due to reinfection, particularly after 2 years.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Maharjan B, Chantratita N, Vesaratchavest M, ''et al.'' | title=Recurrent Melioidosis in Patients in Northeast Thailand Is Frequently Due to Reinfection Rather than Relapse | journal=J Clin Microbiol | year=2005 | volume=43 | issue=12 | pages=6032&ndash;4 | pmid=16333094 | doi=10.1128/JCM.43.12.6032-6034.2005 | pmc=1317219}}</ref> Risk factors include severity of disease (patients with positive blood cultures or multifocal disease have a higher risk of relapse), choice of antibiotic for eradication therapy (doxycycline monotherapy and fluoroquinolone therapy are not as effective), poor compliance with eradication therapy and duration of eradication therapy less than 8 weeks.<ref name="Direk2006"/><ref>{{cite journal | author=Chaowagul W, Suputtamongkol Y, Dance DA, Rajchanuvong A, Pattara-arechachai J, White NJ | year=1993 | title=Relapse in melioidosis: incidence and risk factors | journal=J Infect Dis | volume=168 | pages=1181&ndash;85 | pmid=8228352 | issue=5 | doi=10.1093/infdis/168.5.1181}}</ref>

==Prevention==
Person-to-person transmission is exceedingly unusual;<ref name="Holland2002"/><ref name="McCormick1975"/><ref name="Kunakorn1991"/> and patients with melioidosis should not be considered contagious. Lab workers should handle ''Burkholderia pseudomallei'' under [[BSL-3]] isolation conditions,<ref>{{cite book|author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevetion|title=Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories|publisher=National Institutes of Health|location=Atlanta, Georgia|year=2009|edition=5th}}</ref> as laboratory acquired melioidosis has been described.

In endemic areas, people (rice-paddy farmers in particular) are warned to avoid contact with soil, mud and surface water where possible.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Case clusters have been described following flooding and cyclones and probably relate to exposure. Other case clusters have related to contamination of drinking water supplies. Populations at risk include patients with [[diabetes mellitus]], [[chronic renal failure]], chronic lung disease or patients with an immune deficiency of any kind. The effectiveness of measures to reduce exposure to the causative organism have not been established. A vaccine is not yet available.

===Post-exposure prophylaxis===
After exposure to ''B. pseudomallei'' (particularly following a laboratory accident) combined treatment with co-trimoxazole and doxycycline is recommended.<ref name="Sivalingam2008">{{cite journal|author=Sivalingam SP, Sim SH, Jasper LC, ''et al.''|title=Pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis of experimental Burkholderia pseudomallei infection with doxycycline, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and co-trimoxazole|journal=J Antimicrob Chemother|year=2008|volume=61|issue=3|pages=674&ndash;8|pmid=18192684|doi=10.1093/jac/dkm527}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Peacock SJ, Schweizer HP, Dance DAB, ''et al.''|title=Management of Accidental Laboratory Exposure to Burkholderia pseudomallei and B. mallei|journal=Emerg Infect Dis|year=2008|volume=14|issue=7|pages=e2|doi=10.3201/eid1407.071501|pmid=18598617|pmc=2600349}}</ref> [[Trovafloxacin]] and [[grepafloxacin]] have been shown to be effective in animal models.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kenny DJ, Sefton AM, Brooks TJ, Laws TR, Simpson AJ, Atkins HS|title=Evaluation of azithromycin, trovafloxacin and grepafloxacin as prophylaxis for experimental murine melioidosis|journal=Int J Antimicrob Agents|volume=36|issue=1|pages=87–9|year=2010|pmid= 20462743|doi=10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2010.03.019}}</ref>

There are no vaccines currently licensed for the prevention of melioidosis.

==Biological warfare potential==
There has been interest in melioidosis because it has the potential to be developed as a [[biological warfare|biological weapon]]. It is classed by the US [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) as a [[Bioterrorism#Types of biological agents|Category B agent]].<ref>{{CDCDiseaseInfo|melioidosis}}</ref> ''B. pseudomallei'', like its relative ''B. mallei'' which causes [[Glanders]], was studied by the U.S. as a potential biological warfare agent, but was never weaponized.<ref>{{cite book|author=Woods JB (ed.)|title=USAMRIID's Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbook|edition=6th|publisher=[[USAMRIID|U.S. Army Medical Institute of Infectious Diseases]]|location=Fort Detrick, Maryland|year=2005|url=http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%206th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202006.pdf|format=PDF|pages=67}}</ref>  It has been reported that the [[Soviet Union]] was also experimenting with ''B. pseudomallei'' as a biological warfare agent.
