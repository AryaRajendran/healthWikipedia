'''Susac's syndrome''' ('''Retinocochleocerebral Vasculopathy''') is a [[microangiopathy]] characterized by [[encephalopathy]], branch [[retinal artery]] occlusions and [[hearing loss]]. It is caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissue, and can lead to mental disorders.

==Description==
Susac's Syndrome is named for Dr. John Susac (1940-2012), of [[Winter Haven, Florida]], who first described it in 1979.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Susac J, Hardman J, Selhorst J|title=Microangiopathy of the brain and retina|journal=Neurology|volume=29|issue=3|page=313|year=1979}}</ref> Susac's syndrome is a very rare disease, of still unknown etiology, and many persons who experience it do not display the bizarre symptoms named here. Some sufferers often experience a personality change and develop bizarre and paranoid behavior. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Their speech can be affected, such as the case of a female of late teens who suffered speech issues and hearing problems, and many experience unrelenting and intense headaches and migraines, some form of hearing loss, and impaired vision. The problem usually corrects itself, but this can take up to five years. In some cases, subjects can become confused. The syndrome usually affects women around the age of 18 years old, with female to male ratio of cases of 2:1.

William F. Hoyt was the first to call the syndrome "Susac Syndrome" and later Robert Daroff asked Dr. Susac to write an editorial in Neurology about the disorder and to use the eponym of Susac Syndrome in the title forever linking this disease with him.

==Diagnosis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
Patients typically present with low frequency hearing loss detectable via an audiogram.  Headaches are frequently present in addition to roaring tinnitus and often some degree of paranoia.  Partial vision loss is often present and caused by branch retinal artery occlusions.  The presence of refractile or non-refractile yellow Gass plaques in the retinal arterioles is near pathognomonic for the disease.  Fluorescein angiography may demonstrate leakage in areas remote from the retinal infarctions.  

Radiographic Appearance: In a recent analysis (Susac et al., 2003), MRI images from 27 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of Susac's syndrome were reviewed. Multifocal supratentorial lesions were present in all patients. Most lesions were small (3 to 7&nbsp;mm), though some were larger than 7&nbsp;mm. All 27 patients had corpus callosum lesions. These all had a punched-out appearance on follow up MRI. Though most commonly involving white matter, many patients also had lesions in deep grey matter structures, as well as leptomeningeal enhancement. [[Multiple sclerosis]] (MS) and [[acute disseminated encephalomyelitis]] (ADEM) can mimic the MRI changes seen in patients with Susac's syndrome. However, the callosal lesions in Susac's syndrome are centrally located. In comparison, patients with MS and ADEM typically have lesions involving the undersurface of the corpus callosum. Deep gray matter involvement commonly occurs in ADEM but is very rare in MS. Leptomemingeal involvement is not typical of either MS or ADEM.  What this means is that if you have 10 lesions in the brain of an MS patient, you may find one in the corpus callosum.  If you have 10 lesions in a Susac patient, more than half will be in the corpus callosum.

A concern about this illness is that it mimics multiple sclerosis when looking at the vision loss and brain lesions.  Hearing loss does not occur in MS.  If someone does not look closely in the eyes of a patient with vision loss who has brain lesions, their diagnosis can be mistaken for MS instead of Susac syndrome.  This may account for the low prevalence of the illness.  The disease may actually be more common.

==Treatment==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
None of the treatments has been scientifically confirmed. All are speculative. Some of the treatments have side effects that the patient does not need to suffer. Many with Susac's syndrome improve with no treatment. There are a few reported cases of Susac's Syndrome-related retinopathy responding to [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]], with significant improvement of acuity. There is another report of the syndrome recurring after 18 years. Treatment regimens proposed empirically include [[intravenous immune globulin|IVIG]] and high-dose intravenous [[steroids]]. It is generally agreed{{by whom|date=August 2010}} that some method of immunosuppression is necessary, at least at the initial onset of the syndrome. A recent paper from Vanderbilt University Medical Center confirmed that "immunosuppression is the mainstay of Susac’s syndrome treatment". Dr. William Hoyt, M.D., neuro-ophthalmologist at UCSF who gave the syndrome the name Susac's, compared it to a "storm going through."

Currently, the mainstay of treatment is to start oral or intravenous high dose steroids in addition to intravenous immunoglobulin.  If this does not quiet the disease down then drugs like Cellcept, Imuran, or Rituxan may be used.  Dr. Susac also used Tysabri (an MS drug) on 2 patients and found very good results in quieting the disease down (personal communication with Dr. Susac).

==Pathogenesis==
In the March 1979 report in ''Neurology'', Drs. Susac, Hardman and Selhorst reported two patients with the triad of encephalopathy, hearing loss and microangiopathy of the retina. The first patient underwent brain biopsy, which revealed sclerosis of the media and adventitia of small pial and cortical vessels, suggestive of a healed angiitis. Both patients underwent fluorescein retinal angiography that demonstrated multifocal retinal artery occlusions without evidence of embolic disease. Though the exact pathogenesis of this disorder is unknown, the retinal and brain biopsy findings suggest a small vessel vasculopathy leading to arteriolar occlusion and microinfarction of cerebral, retinal and cochlear tissue. Demyelination is not a typical feature of Susac's syndrome. Muscle biopsies from such patients are usually normal, but some have also shown nonspecific signs of inflammation such as dense hyaline material surrounding endomysial capillaries. This suggests a possible systemic component of this disease, despite the predominance of central nervous system features.  The latest thinking is that an antibody directed against endothelial cells is the pathogenic mechanism in this disease.
