'''Primary gain''' or '''secondary gain''' are used in [[medicine]] to describe the significant psychological [[motivation|motivators]] patients may have in reporting symptoms.

'''Primary gain''' produces positive internal motivations.  For example, a patient might feel guilty about being unable to perform some task. If he has a medical condition justifying his inability, he might not feel so bad. Primary gain can be a component of any disease, but is most dramatically demonstrated in [[conversion disorder]] (a psychiatric disorder in which stressors manifest themselves as physical symptoms without organic causes, such as a person who becomes blindly inactive after seeing a murder). The "gain" may not be particularly evident to an outside observer.

'''Secondary gain''' can also be a component of any disease, but is an external motivator. If a patient's disease allows him/her to miss work, avoid military duty, obtain financial compensation, obtain drugs, or avoid a jail sentence, these would be examples of secondary gain. These may, but need not be, recognized by the patient. If he/she is deliberately exaggerating symptoms for personal gain, then he/she is [[malingering]]. However, secondary gain may simply be an unconscious psychological component of symptoms and other personalities.  In the context of a person with a significant mental or psychiatric disability, this effect is sometimes called '''secondary handicap'''.<ref>Jones, Robert, Carmel Harrison, and Melany Ball.  "Secondary Handicap & Learning Disability: A Component Analysis."  ''Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Research and Practice'', 2008, 5, 300-311.</ref>

'''Tertiary gain''', a less well-studied process, is when a third party such as a relative or friend is motivated to gain sympathy or other benefits from the illness of the victim.
