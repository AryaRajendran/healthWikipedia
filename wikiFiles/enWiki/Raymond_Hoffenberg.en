'''Sir Raymond ("Bill") Hoffenberg''' [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] (16 March 1923 – 22 April 2007) was an [[endocrinology|endocrinologist]] who specialised in the study of the [[thyroid]].  Born in [[South Africa]], he was forced to leave in 1968, and settled in the [[United Kingdom]], where he was [[President]] of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] from 1983 to 1989, and [[President (college)|President]] of [[Wolfson College, Oxford]] from 1985 to 1993.

Hoffenberg was born and educated in [[Port Elizabeth]] in [[South Africa]].  He was a brilliant student, and studied medicine at the [[University of Cape Town]] from 1939, aged only 16. He was also an active sportsman, taking part in [[tennis]], [[golf]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[boxing]], and [[Rugby (sport)|rugby]].  

He enlisted in the [[South African Army|Union Defence Force]] in 1942, serving as a [[stretcher bearer]] in the [[Second World War]] in [[North Africa]] and [[Italy]] in the [[6th South African Armoured Division]].  He returned to South Africa to complete his degrees, [[Bachelor of Medicine|MB]] and [[ChB]], in 1948.  He was an intern at [[Groote Schuur Hospital]], and then a lecturer at the University of Cape Town Medical School.  He married his first wife, Margaret Rosenberg in 1949, and they lived in [[Newlands, Cape Town|Newlands]].  They had two sons.

He spent some time serving under [[Albert Schweitzer]] at [[Lambaréné]] in [[French Equatorial Africa]] (now [[Gabon]]), and travelled to the [[United States]] in 1957–8 under a [[Carnegie Fellowship]], and started to specialise in endocrinology.  He obtained his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in 1957 and [[PhD]] in 1968.  He was a lecturer at the Department of Medicine at the University of Cape Town from 1955 to 1967.  He also continued to practise medicine at Groote Schuur Hospital, where he was involved preparing for [[Christiaan Barnard]]'s first [[heart transplant]] operation in 1967.  

He ran into political difficulties in South Africa.  He opposed the [[apartheid]] policies of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], and supported [[Alan Paton]]'s [[Liberal Party (South Africa)|Liberal Party]], which he had joined in 1953.  He had been a friend Paton and of the party's chairman, [[Peter Brown (South African politician)|Peter Brown]], since they were students together in Cape Town, and was also a friend of Paton.  He supported the [[National Union of South African Students]], and was chairman of the [[Defence and Aid Fund]], which funded the defence of those accused of political crimes and supported their families, until it was banned in 1966.  In July 1967, the [[Prime Minister]] [[John Vorster]] passed a [[banning order]] under the [[Suppression of Communism Act]] which prohibited him from all political and social activity for 5 years.  By now, he had an international reputation as a leading endocrinologist, and the banning order led to widespread protest.

He and his family were given an "exit permit" to leave South Africa in 1968, on condition that they did not come back.  He moved to the United Kingdom, where he continued to lend support to the campaign against apartheid.  The exiled [[Oliver Tambo]] was a patient for many years.

He worked for the [[National Medical Health and Research Council]] at [[Mill Hill]] in north London, and at the [[thyroid]] clinic at [[New End Hospital]] in [[Hampstead]], for four years from 1968.  He became professor of medicine at [[Birmingham University]] in 1972, where he developed an outstanding endocrine department.  He became President of [[Wolfson College, Oxford]] in 1985.  

Meanwhile, he was President of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] from 1983 to 1989, publicly disagreeing with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government's policy of introducing an internal market into the [[National Health Service]].  He was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] in 1984.  He was also president of the [[International Society for Endocrinology]], chairman of the [[British Heart Foundation]], and chairman of the [[Medical Campaign Against Nuclear War]] and later vice-president of its successor, [[MEDACT]].  He held six honorary doctorates, and was a fellow of seven learned societies.  After the [[Alder Hey organs scandal]] came to light in 1999, he courted controversy by arguing for the medical benefits from retaining tissue samples from [[post-mortem]] examinations.

He retired in 1993, and he and his wife joined his two sons in [[Australia]].  He moved to [[Queensland]], where he was professor of medical ethics at the [[University of Queensland]] from 1993 to 1995. 

After the death of his first wife in 2005, he married Gräfin Madeleine Douglas in 2006.  He died in [[Oxford]].  He was survived by his second wife, and his two sons from his first marriage.
