'''Psychotic depression''' refers to a [[major depressive episode]] which is accompanied by [[psychosis|psychotic]] symptoms.<ref name=APP>Hales E and Yudofsky JA, eds, The American Psychiatric Press Textbook of Psychiatry, Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc., 2003</ref>  It can occur in the context of [[bipolar disorder]] or [[major depressive disorder]].<ref name=APP/>  It can be difficult to distinguish from [[schizoaffective disorder]]; that disorder requires the presence of psychotic symptoms for at least two weeks without any mood symptoms present.<ref name=APP/>  Diagnosis using the [[DSM-IV]] involves meeting the criteria for a major depressive episode, along with the criteria for the "psychotic features" specifier.<ref name=DSM-IV>{{cite book|last=American Psychiatric Association|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed., text revision)|year=2000|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|location=Washington DC|isbn=978-0890420256}}</ref>

== Symptoms ==

Individuals with psychotic depression experience the symptoms of a major depressive episode, along with one or more psychotic symptoms, including [[delusion]]s and/or [[hallucination]]s.<ref name=APP/>  Delusions can be classified as mood congruent or incongruent, depending on whether or not the nature of the delusions is in keeping with the individual's mood state.<ref name=APP/>  Common themes of mood congruent delusions include guilt, punishment, personal inadequacy, or disease.<ref name="APA guideline">{{cite web |url=http://psychiatryonline.org/content.aspx?bookid=28&sectionid=1667485 |title=Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients with Major Depressive Disorder, 3rd ed. |date=2010 |work=APA Practice Guidelines |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |accessdate=April 6, 2013}}</ref>  Half of patients experience more than one kind of delusion.<ref name=APP/>  Delusions occur without hallucinations in about one-half to two-thirds of patients with psychotic depression.<ref name=APP/>  Hallucinations can be auditory, visual, olfactory (smell), or haptic (touch).<ref name=APP/>

Patients with psychotic depression may have a greater suicide risk than patients with non-psychotic depression.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  They may also have greater cognitive deficits (e.g., memory problems) than those with non-psychotic depression.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

== Course ==

Psychotic symptoms tend to develop after an individual has already had several episodes of depression without psychosis.<ref name=APP/>  However, once psychotic symptoms have emerged, they tend to reappear with each future depressive episode.<ref name=APP/>  The [[prognosis]] for psychotic depression is not considered to be as poor as for schizoaffective disorders or primary psychotic disorders.<ref name=APP/>  Still, those who have experienced a depressive episode with psychotic features have an increased risk of relapse and suicide compared to those without psychotic features, and they tend to have more pronounced sleep abnormalities.<ref name="APA guideline"/><ref name=APP/>

The families of those who have experienced psychotic depression are at increased risk for both psychotic depression and schizophrenia.<ref name=APP/>

Most patients with psychotic depression report having an initial episode between the ages of 20 and 40. Over a lifetime, it appears that patients with psychotic depression experience an average of 4 to 9 episodes.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} As with other depressive episodes, psychotic depression tends to be episodic, with symptoms lasting for a certain amount of time and then subsiding. While psychotic depression can be chronic (lasting more than 2 years), most depressive episodes episodes last less than 24 months. Unlike psychotic disorders such as [[schizophrenia]] and [[schizoaffective disorder]], patients with psychotic depression generally function well between episodes, both socially and professionally.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

== Differential diagnosis ==
{{See also|Depression (differential diagnoses)}}
Psychotic symptoms are often missed in psychotic depression, either because patients do not think their symptoms are abnormal or they attempt to conceal their symptoms from others.<ref name=APP/>  On the other hand, psychotic depression may be confused with [[schizoaffective disorder]].<ref name=APP/>

== Pathophysiology ==

There are a number of biological features that may distinguish psychotic depression from non-psychotic depression. The most significant difference may be the presence of an abnormality in the [[hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis|hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) axis]]. The HPA axis appears to be dysregulated in psychotic depression, with [[dexamethasone suppression test]]s demonstrating higher levels of [[cortisol]] following [[dexamethasone]] administration (i.e. lower cortisol suppression).<ref name=APP/>  Those with psychotic depression also have higher ventricular-to-brain ratios than those with non-psychotic depression.<ref name=APP/>

== History of treatments ==

Before [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) was invented in the 1930s, it was frequently observed that patients experiencing delusions with depression had poorer response to medication treatment. ECT seemed to have similar effects for depressed patients both with and without psychotic symptoms. The interest in psychotic depression increased after [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs) became available, because while non-psychotic depression responded to TCAs, psychotic depression did not.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} In the past 40 years there has been a renewed interest in psychotic depression. The FDA is considering a special class of drugs for the treatment of PMD as researchers learn more about the biology of the disease. 

Many studies have suggested that psychotic depression differs from non-psychotic depression in treatment response. Psychotic depression is less likely than non-psychotic depression to respond to placebo and to the use of only an [[antidepressant]] or an [[antipsychotic]]. The combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic appears to be necessary for the treatment of psychotic depression. Early studies suggest an 80-90% response rate in psychotic depression with combination treatment.

== Established treatment strategies ==

Patients with psychotic depression should be treated with a combination of [[antipsychotic]] and [[antidepressant]] medications, or [[electroconvulsive therapy]].<ref name="APA guideline"/>  ECT is considered a first-line treatment in severe depression with psychotic features.<ref name="APA guideline"/><ref>Conrad M. Swartz. Edward Shorter. 2008. ''Psychotic Depression''. Cambridge University Press.</ref>

The antidepressant [[bupropion]] has been associated with a small risk of triggering psychotic symptoms, so it should be used with caution in those with psychotic depression.<ref name="APA guideline"/>


== Experimental treatment strategies ==

The current treatments of psychotic depression are reasonably effective but tend to carry a high side effect burden and may take a long time to work. Combination treatment with atypical antipsychotics and SSRIs tend to be associated with significant weight gain and sexual dysfunction. TCAs are lethal in overdose and some are associated with extra-pyramidal side effects including [[tardive dyskinesia]]. Finally, ECT has side effects of temporary cognitive deficits (e.g., confusion, memory problems), in addition to the burden of repeated exposures to general anesthesia. 

Among the newer experimental treatments is the study of glucocorticoid antagonists, including [[mifepristone]].<ref name="pmid11593077">{{cite journal |author=Belanoff JK, Flores BH, Kalezhan M, Sund B, Schatzberg AF |title=Rapid reversal of psychotic depression using mifepristone |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=516â€“21 |year=2001 |month=October |pmid=11593077 |doi=10.1097/00004714-200110000-00009 |url= }}</ref> These strategies may treat the underlying pathophysiology of psychotic depression by correcting an overactive [[HPA axis]]. By competitively blocking certain neuro-receptors, these medications render cortisol less able to directly act on the brain. 
 
[[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) is being investigated as an alternative to ECT in the treatment of depression. TMS involves the administration of a focused electromagnetic field to the cortex to stimulate specific nerve pathways. A number of early studies have shown promise of TMS in major depressive disorder with few side effects. TMS does not require anesthesia and has not been associated with significant cognitive deficits.
