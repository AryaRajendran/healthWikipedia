'''Amsler sign''' also known as '''Amsler-Verrey sign''' is the name of the diagnostic finding seen in patients with [[Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis]] (FHI). It is described as presence of blood ([[hyphema]]) in the aspirated [[vitreous fluid]], in [[paracentesis]] of the [[anterior chamber]], and is caused due to [[iris (eye)|iris]] atrophy usually seen in FHI and exposure of the fragile iris [[vasculature]] to the [[vitreous fluid]]. The sudden change of pressure in the anterior chamber upon suction induced by the paracentesis, or during a [[cataract]] surgery,<ref name=doi /> causes bursting of the fragile superficial iris [[capillaries]] resultsing in micro-bleeding. This is one clinical [[diagnostic sign]] of FHI.<ref name=doi>{{cite journal|title=Amsler-Verrey sign during cataract surgery in Fuchs heterochromic uveitis|author=Sathish Srinivasan, Douglas Lyall, Christine Kiire|date=16 July 2010|publisher=BMJ Case Reports|doi=10.1136/bcr.11.2009.2456|url=http://casereports.bmj.com/content/2010/bcr.11.2009.2456.abstract|journal=Case Reports|volume=2010|pages=bcr1120092456–bcr1120092456}}</ref><ref name=yek>{{cite web|title=Marc Amsler|author=mrcophth|accessdate=15 December 2010|url=http://www.mrcophth.com/ophthalmologyhalloffame/amsler.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Unusual presentation of Amsler's sign in Fuchs' heterochromic uveitis|author=Pammal T.
