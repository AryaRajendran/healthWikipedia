'''Pulmonary interstitial emphysema''' ('''PIE''') is a collection of air outside of the normal air passages in the body and instead is found inside the connective tissue of the peribronchovascular sheaths, interlobular septa, and [[visceral pleura]]. This collection develops as a result of alveolar and terminal bronchiolar rupture. Pulmonary interstitial emphysema is more frequent in premature infants who require [[mechanical ventilation]] for severe lung disease.  Infants suffering from pulmonary interstitial emphysema are typically recommended for admission to a [[neonatal intensive care unit]].

== Pathophysiology ==
Pulmonary interstitial emphysema is created when air bursts or ruptures through tissue from the alveoli and [[bronchioles]] into the perivascular tissue of the lung.

== Etiology ==
Pulmonary interstitial emphysema is a concern in any of the following diagnosis:
*Prematurity
*[[Respiratory distress syndrome]] (RDS)
*[[Meconium aspiration syndrome]] (MAS)
*[[Amniotic fluid]] aspiration
*Sepsis, or other infections
*[[Mechanical ventilation]]

== Epidemiology ==
=== United States ===
The prevalence of pulmonary interstitial emphysema widely varies with the population studied. In a 1987 study 3% of infants admitted to the [[neonatal intensive care unit]] (NICU) developed pulmonary interstitial emphysema.<ref name="pmid3595042">{{cite journal| author=Heneghan MA, Sosulski R, Alarcon MB| title=Early pulmonary interstitial emphysema in the newborn: a grave prognostic sign. | journal=Clin Pediatr (Phila) | year= 1987 | volume= 26 | issue= 7 | pages= 361–5 | pmid=3595042 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=3595042  }} </ref>

=== International ===
Studies reflecting international frequency demonstrated that 2-3% of all infants in NICUs develop pulmonary interstitial emphysema.<ref name="pmid6351760">{{cite journal| author=Hart SM, McNair M, Gamsu HR, Price JF| title=Pulmonary interstitial emphysema in very low birthweight infants. | journal=Arch Dis Child | year= 1983 | volume= 58 | issue= 8 | pages= 612–5 | pmid=6351760 | doi= | pmc=1628320  }} </ref><ref name="pmid3767787">{{cite journal| author=Yu VY, Wong PY, Bajuk B, Szymonowicz W| title=Pulmonary interstitial emphysema in infants less than 1000 g at birth. | journal=Aust Paediatr J | year= 1986 | volume= 22 | issue= 3 | pages= 189–92 | pmid=3767787 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=3767787  }} </ref>  When limiting the population studied to premature infants, this frequency increases to 20-30%, with the highest frequencies occurring in infants weighing fewer than 1000 g.<ref name="pmid4022695">{{cite journal| author=Gaylord MS, Thieme RE, Woodall DL, Quissell BJ| title=Predicting mortality in low-birth-weight infants with pulmonary interstitial emphysema. | journal=Pediatrics | year= 1985 | volume= 76 | issue= 2 | pages= 219–24 | pmid=4022695 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=4022695  }} </ref>

== Prognosis ==
Pulmonary interstitial emphysema often resolves gradually and may take 2-3 weeks.<ref name="pmid3595042">{{cite journal| author=Heneghan MA, Sosulski R, Alarcon MB| title=Early pulmonary interstitial emphysema in the newborn: a grave prognostic sign. | journal=Clin Pediatr (Phila) | year= 1987 | volume= 26 | issue= 7 | pages= 361–5 | pmid=3595042 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=3595042  }} </ref>  For longer durations of PIE the length of time of mechanical ventilation needed may increase and the incidence of [[bronchopulmonary dysplasia]] becomes higher.

== Treatment ==
Different treatments have been used to manage pulmonary interstitial emphysema with variable success. Admission/transfer to a [[neonatal intensive care unit]] (NICU) is common and expected for patients with PIE.
Treatments include:
*Lateral decubitus position with the affected side down 
*[[High-frequency ventilation]]
*[[Lobectomy]]
*Selective Main Bronchial Intubation and Occlusion<ref name="pmid17238893">{{cite journal| author=Chalak LF, Kaiser JR, Arrington RW| title=Resolution of pulmonary interstitial emphysema following selective left main stem intubation in a premature newborn: an old procedure revisited. | journal=Paediatr Anaesth | year= 2007 | volume= 17 | issue= 2 | pages= 183–6 | pmid=17238893 | doi=10.1111/j.1460-9592.2006.02044.x | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=17238893  }} </ref>
