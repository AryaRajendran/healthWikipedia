'''Cutaneous leishmaniasis''' (also known as "Aleppo boil," "Baghdad boil," "Bay sore," "Biskra button," "Chiclero ulcer," "Delhi boil," "Kandahar sore," "Lahore sore," "Leishmaniasis tropica," "Oriental sore," "Pian bois," and "Uta"<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7216-2921-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|423}}) is the most common form of [[leishmaniasis]]. It is a skin infection caused by a single-celled parasite that is transmitted by [[Phlebotominae|sandfly]] bites.  There are about 20 species of ''[[Leishmania]]'' that may cause [[cutaneous]] leishmaniasis.

==Signs and symptoms==

===Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis===
{{main|Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis}}
'''Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis''' (PKDL) is a recurrence of [[Kala-azar]] that may appear on the skin of affected individuals up to 20 years after being partially treated, untreated or even in those considered adequately treated.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Banerjee N |title=Role of I.M.A. during natural calamities and national emergencies |journal=Journal of the Indian Medical Association|volume=61 |issue=11 |pages=477–81 |year=1973 |pmid=4600129 |doi=}}</ref><ref name="pmid16394433">{{cite journal |author=Rathi SK, Pandhi RK, Chopra P, Khanna N|title=Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis: a histopathological study |journal=Indian journal of dermatology, venereology and leprology |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=250–3 |year=2005 |pmid=16394433|doi=10.4103/0378-6323.16616}}</ref> In [[Sudan]] they can be demonstrated in up to 60% of treated cases. They manifest as hypo-pigmented [[macules]], [[papules]], [[Nodule (medicine)|nodules]], or facial [[erythema]]. Though any organism causing Kala-azar can lead to PKDL, it is commonly associated with ''[[Leishmania|L. donovani]]'' which gives different disease patterns in [[India]] and Sudan. In the Indian variant, nodules enlarge with time and form plaques but rarely ulcerate, but nodules from the African variety often ulcerate as they progress. Nerve involvement is common in African variety but rare in Indian subcontinent.<ref name="pmid16778312">{{cite journal |author=Salotra P, Singh R |title=Challenges in the diagnosis of post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis |journal=Indian J.

Current approach to diagnosis involves 1. demonstration of parasite by microscopy, ''in vitro'' culture or animal inoculation; 2. immuno-diagnosis of parasite antigen; 3. detection of parasite DNA in tissue. Newer PCR based tools have higher sensitivity and specificity.

Sodium stibogluconate (SSG) alone or in combination with rifampicin is used for the treatment of PKLD for a long course of up to 4 months. Compliance can be an issue for such a long course.

===Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis===
{{main|Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis}}
Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis is the most feared form of cutaneous leishmaniasis because it produces destructive and disfiguring lesions of the face.  It is most often caused by ''Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis'', but cases caused by ''L. aethiopica'' have also been rarely described.

Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis is treated with long courses (e.g. 30 days) of [[pentavalent antimonial]]s in a high dose (20&nbsp;mg/kg). This may fail to cure up to 42% of patients.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Franke ED, Wignall FS, Cruz ME, ''et al.'' | title=Efficacy and toxicity of sodium stibogluconate for mucosal leishmaniasis | journal=Ann Intern Med | year=1990 | volume=113 |pages=934–40 | pmid=2173461 | issue=12 }}</ref> Even in those patients who achieve an apparent cure, as many as 19% will relapse.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Netto EM, Marsden PD, Llanos-Cuentas EA, ''et al.'' |title=Long-term follow-up of patients with ''Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis'' infection and treated with glucantime | journal=Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg | year=1990 | volume=84 | pages=367–70 |pmid=2260171 | doi=10.1016/0035-9203(90)90321-5 | issue=3 }}</ref> Several drug combinations with immunomodulators have been tested, for example, a combination of [[pentoxifylline]] (inhibitor of [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|TNF-α]]) and a [[pentavalent antimonial]] at a high-dose for 30 days in a small-scale (23 patients) randomised [[placebo]]-controlled study from [[Brazil]] achieved cure rates of 90% and reduced time to cure,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Machado PRL, Lessa H, Lessa M,''et al.'' | title=Oral pentoxifylline combined with pentavalent antimony: A randomized trial for mucosal leishmaniasis | journal=Clin Infect Dis | year=2007 | volume=44 | pages=788–93 | url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/6/788.full| doi=10.1086/511643 | pmid=17304449 | issue=6 }}</ref> a result that should be interpreted cautiously in light of inherent limitations of small-scale studies.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ojha R.P.''et al.'' | year = 2007 | title = Oral pentoxifylline and pentavalent antimony for treatment of leishmaniasis: promising but inconclusive evidence of superiority, compared with antimony monotherapy| journal = Clin.

==Pathophysiology==
[[Promastigote]]s of leishmania are transmitted to human skin by the bite of a sandfly.  Leishmania then invades human macrophages and replicates intracellularly.

A raised, red [[lesion]] develops at the site of the bite (often weeks or sometimes years afterwards).  The lesion then ulcerates and may become secondarily infected with bacteria.  In many species (for example, ''[[Leishmania major|L. major]]'') the lesion often spontaneously heals with [[Wiktionary:atrophy|atrophic]] scarring.  In some species (for example, ''L. viannia braziliensis'') the lesion may spontaneously heal with scarring, but then re-appear elsewhere (especially as destructive mucocutaneous lesions).  Lesions of other leishmania species may spontaneously heal and then re-appear as satellite lesions around the site of the original lesion, or along the route of lymphatic drainage.

Some species tend to cause cutaneous leishmaniasis (e.g., ''[[Leishmania major|L. major]]'' and ''[[Leishmania tropica|L.tropica]]''), whereas some species tend to cause [[visceral leishmaniasis]] (e.g., ''[[Leishmania infantum|L.&nbsp;infantum]]'' and ''[[Leishmania donovani|L&nbsp;donovani]]''), though emerging research (due to high deployment rates of western countries to indigenous areas) is showing these species specific presentation lines are blurring {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is based on the characteristic appearance of non-healing raised, scaling lesions that may ulcerate and become secondarily infected with organisms such as ''Staphylococcus aureus'', in someone who has returned from an endemic area.  The gold standard for diagnosis is [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reithinger R & Dujardin J-C |title=Molecular diagnosis of leishmaniasis: current status and future applications |journal=J Clin Microbiol |year=2007 |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=21–25 |doi=10.1128/JCM.02029-06 |pmid=17093038 |pmc=1828971 }}</ref>

==Treatment==
The evidence for optimal treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis is patchy.  Treatments that work for one species of leishmania may not work for another; it is recommended that advice of a tropical medicine or geographical medicine specialist be sought.  Ideally, every effort should be made to establish the species of leishmania by molecular techniques (PCR) prior to starting treatment.  In the setting of a developing country, there is often only one species present in a particular locality, so it is usually unnecessary to speciate every infection.  Unfortunately, leishmaniasis is an [[orphan disease]], and almost all the current treatment options are toxic with significant side-effects.

;[[Leishmania major]]
:''L. major'' infections are usually considered to heal spontaneously and do not require treatment, but there have been several reports of severe cases caused by ''[[L. major]]'' in Afghanistan.  In [[Saudi Arabia]], a six-week course of oral [[fluconazole]] 200 mg daily has been reported to speed up healing.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Alrajhi AA, Ibrahim EA, De Vol EB, ''et al.'' |title=Fluconazole for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by ''Leishmania major'' |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=346 |issue=12 |pages=891–95 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/346/12/891 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa011882 |year=2002 |pmid=11907288 }}</ref>
In a randomized clinical trial from Iran, [[fluconazole]] 400&nbsp;mg daily was shown to be significantly more effective than fluconazole 200&nbsp;mg daily in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis.<ref name="">[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019096221000486X Emad M, Hayati F, Fallahzadeh MK, Namazi MR.

:Treatment with [[pentavalent antimonial]]s or [[amphotericin]] is mandatory, because of the risk of developing disfiguring mucocutaneous lesions.

;''[[Leishmania infantum]]''
:''L. infantum'' causes cutaneous leishmaniasis in southern France.<ref name="Pratlong2004">{{cite journal |author= Pratlong F. ''et al.'' |year= 2004|title= Isoenzymatic analysis of 712 strains of ''Leishmania infantum'' in the south of France and relationship of enzymatic polymorphism to clinical and epidemiological features|journal= Journal of Clinical Microbiology |volume= 42 |issue= 9 |pages= 4077–82 |pmid= 15364993|doi= 10.1128/jcm.42.9.4077-4082.2004 |pmc= 516332}}</ref>

New treatment options are arising from the new oral drug [[Miltefosine]] (Impavido) which has shown in several clinical trials to be very efficient and safe in visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Recent studies from Bolivia show a high cure rate for mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Comparative studies against pentavalent antimonials in Iran and Pakistan are also beginning to show a high cure rate for L.major and L.tropica.
It is registered in many countries of Latin America (e.g., Colombia), as well in Germany, the home country of its developer [[Zentaris]] GmbH. In October 2006 it received orphan drug status from the US Food and Drug administration. The drug is generally better tolerated than other drugs. Main side effects are gastrointestinal disturbances in the 1–2 days of treatment which does not affect the efficacy.

Secondary bacterial infection (especially with ''Staphylococcus aureus'') is common and may require antibiotics. Clinicians who are unfamiliar with cutaneous leishmaniasis may mistake the lesion for a pure bacterial infection (especially after isolation of ''S. aureus'' from bacterial skin swabs) and fail to consider the possibility of leishmaniasis.

==Epidemiology==
Cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic to many parts of the world.  Around twenty different species of ''Leishmania'' parasite are capable of infecting humans.  The distribution of cutaneous leishmaniasis is very tightly linked to geography and villages even 15&nbsp;miles apart can have very different rates of cutaneous leishmaniasis.

Some ''Leishmania'' species are closely linked to humans and are therefore found in cities (e.g., [[Leishmania tropica|''L. tropica'']]), whereas some are more traditionally associated with animal species and are therefore considered [[zoonosis|zoonoses]] (e.g., [[Leishmania major|''L.&nbsp;major'']]).  Some species that are traditionally considered zoonotic (e.g., ''L.&nbsp;panamensis'') may be becoming primarily human diseases.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Evidence for ''Leishmania'' (Viannia) parasites in the skin and blood of patients before and after treatment |author=Vergel C, Palacios R, Cadena H, ''et al.'' | journal=J Infect Dis | year=2006 | volume=194 |pages=503–511 | doi=10.1086/505583 | pmid=16845635 | issue=4 }}</ref>
