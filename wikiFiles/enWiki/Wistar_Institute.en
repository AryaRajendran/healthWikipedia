The '''Wistar Institute''' is a [[Biomedicine|biomedical]] center, with a focus on [[cancer research]] and [[vaccine]] development. It is located in the [[University City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|University City]] section of [[Philadelphia, Pa.]] Founded in 1892 as the first independent, nonprofit, biomedical research institute in the country, Wistar has held the [[NCI-designated Cancer Center|Cancer Center]] designation from the [[National Cancer Institute]] since 1972. 
Wistar has more than thirty laboratories, which are home to three research programs: a [[gene expression]] and [[Regulation of gene expression|regulation]] program, a molecular and cellular [[oncogenesis]] program, and a [[tumor]] microenvironment and [[metastasis]] program.

==Research==
===Cancer===
The Institute's research program on cancer includes the following goals and areas:

*Cancer [[genetics]]: how [[mutation]]s in [[gene]]s lead to various cancers. 

*[[Stem cell]]s: identifying and characterizing cancer [[stem cells]] that appear to be responsible for recurrent and treatment-resistant forms of cancer. 

*A [[blood test]] for the early detection of [[lung cancer]]: By the time lung cancer, the top cancer killer, is diagnosed, the disease has usually advanced so far that treatment options are limited. Wistar's scientists are developing a [[blood test]] that would detect the disease early.

*[[Telomerase]]-based cancer treatment: The decoding by a Wistar researcher of a key structure of the enzyme telomerase, which plays a significant role in cancer, may lead to the development of a new class of highly targeted [[Chemotherapy|cancer drugs]].<ref name="Telemerase">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7588060.stm|title=Hopes raised for block on cancer |date=31 August 2008|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>

*[[Melanoma]]: Wistar's melanoma research program studies the development of the disease and pursuing treatments for advanced melanoma.

===Immunology===
*Past achievements: Wistar discoveries led to the creation of the [[rubella vaccine]] that is credited with eradicating “German measles” in the United States;<ref name="Rubella">{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2006/January/17010601.asp|title=Rubella vaccines for the former USSR|date=17 January 2006|work=Chemistry World News|publisher=The Royal Society of Chemistry |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> human [[rabies vaccine]]s used worldwide; and a [[rotavirus vaccine]] approved in 2006 that prevents an illness responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children worldwide each year. 

*Vaccine development: Wistar researchers are collaborating with leading scientists worldwide to develop vaccines for [[hepatitis C]], [[malaria]], and other potentially deadly diseases. Wistar is also working on a universal [[influenza vaccine]] that would be effective against all strains of [[influenza]], including [[avian flu]].

*Vaccine licensing: The Institute has licensed its rabies and rubella vaccine seed stock to companies in China, India, and Russia to help these countries develop affordable vaccines for their own populations. 

*Autoimmune disease: Wistar immunologists are developing new therapies for [[autoimmune disease]]s such as [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]] and [[rheumatoid arthritis]].

*HIV-1 Infection: Wistar scientists are developing new strategies for immunotherapy and collaborating with scientists locally and worldwide to develop a greater understanding of cases of natural resistance against infection (exposed uninfected) or disease progression (infected that control virus without therapy).

==Training and outreach==
Wistar's training and outreach initiatives include:

*Educating area youth: Wistar offers internships, tours, and contests to area high school students to stimulate and nurture their interests in science. The Institute also offers a two-year training program for [[Biomedical Equipment Technician|biomedical technicians]] in partnership with the [[Community College of Philadelphia]].

*Engaging the community: The Institute hosts community events including lectures by noted science authors that are designed to stimulate [[Science education|science learning]] and discussion. 

*Training the scientists of tomorrow: Over the past decade, nearly a thousand researchers, from predoctoral students to [[Postdoctoral research|postdoctoral]] fellows and visiting scientists, have trained at Wistar.

==History==
[[File:I J Wistar early life ACW.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Isaac J. Wistar, 1852, San Francisco, California]]The Wistar Institute was founded in 1892 as the nation’s first independent medical research facility. It is named for [[Caspar Wistar (physician)|Caspar Wistar]], M.D., a prominent [[Philadelphia]] physician who began his medical practice in 1787. Dr. Wistar was the author of the first American [[anatomy]] textbook. To augment his medical lectures and illustrate [[comparative anatomy]], Dr. Wistar began a collection of dried, wax-injected, and preserved human specimens. Two years before his death, he appointed William Edmonds Horner, M.D., as caretaker of the collection.

After Dr. Wistar’s death, Horner maintained and expanded the collection of anatomical specimens. The combined collections became known as the Wistar and Horner Museum. The Wistar and Horner Museum collections were further expanded under the curation of [[Joseph Leidy]], M.D., who acquired animal [[Biological specimen|specimen]]s as well as [[fossil]] and [[Biological anthropology|anthropological]] samples. By the late 1880s, the collection was beginning to show signs of wear and neglect, a situation compounded by a fire in Logan Hall at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where the museum was housed.

[[File:WistarInstitute.jpg|left|thumb|150px|The Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, c. 1900-1910]]
When a fundraising campaign to refurbish and re-house the collection began, Dr. Wistar’s great nephew Colonel [[Isaac Jones Wistar]] became involved. Determined to preserve his great-uncle’s teaching collection and support new and original research of anatomy and biology, Isaac Jones Wistar funded an endowment and research building for The Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology. Designed by Philadelphia architects [[G. W. & W. D. Hewitt|George W. and William G. Hewitt]], the original building is still part of the Wistar Institute’s research facility, and is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as part of the historic University City area in Philadelphia. Today, part of the human and animal skeletal collection is housed at the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]].[[File:Wistar rat.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A Wistar rat]]
In 1906, under the leadership of Milton Greenman, M.D., and Henry Donaldson, Ph.D., the Institute developed and bred the [[Wistar_rat#Wistar_rat|Wistar rat]], the first standardized [[Animal testing|laboratory animal]]. It is estimated that more than half of all laboratory rats today are descendants of the original Wistar rat line.<ref>*[http://www.amphilsoc.org/library/mendel/1998.htm  Clause, B. T. (1998).
