Myxedema is a form of hypothyroidism developing in the older child or adult. The clinical manifestations vary with the age of the onset of the deficiency. Clinical features of myxedema are characterized by a slowing of physical and mental activity. The initial symptoms include generalized fatigue, apathy, and mental sluggishness. Speech and intellectual functions become slowed. Patients with myxedema are unenthusiastic, cold intolerant, and frequently overweight. Decreased gastrointestinal motility results in constipation, and decreased sympathetic activity reduces sweating. The skin of these patients is often cool and pale. The patients often complain about shortness of breath and decreased exercise capacity. In addition, hypothyroidism promotes atherogenic profile, and serum levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are increased. Patients with unexplained increase in body weight or hypercholesterolemia should be assessed for potential hypothyroidism. Measurement of serum TSH level is the most sensitive screening test for this disorder.<ref name="Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8ED">{{cite book |author=Vinay Kumar |title=Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |publisher= Saunder Elsevier |year=2010 |pages=1111 |isbn=978-1-4160-3121-5}}</ref>
'''Myxedema''' ([[American and British English spelling differences|BrE]]: '''myxoedema''') describes a specific form of [[cutaneous]] and [[dermal]] [[edema]] secondary to increased deposition of [[connective tissue]] components (like [[glycosaminoglycan]]s, [[hyaluronic acid]], and other [[mucopolysaccharide]]s) in subcutaneous tissue as seen in various forms of [[hypothyroidism]] and [[Graves' disease]] (pretibial myxedema).<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|535}}  It is more common in women than in men.<ref>BRS Pathology - A.S. Schneider, P.A. Szanto - 3rd edition - page 314</ref>

The word originates from {{lang|grc|''μύξα,''}} taken from ancient Greek to convey 'mucus' or 'slimy substance' and {{lang|grc|''ὁίδημα''}} for swelling.

==Signs and Symptoms==

Symptoms of Myxedema include thickening of the skin, and other symptoms associated with hypothyroidism, including [[fatigue]], weight gain, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], dry skin, and brittle hair, among others. The warning signs of myxedema include an intolerance to cold, low blood pressure, shortness of breath, lethargy and seizures. Someone suffering from untreated myxedema can become comatose and die.
Nonpitting edema of the lower extremities is sometimes present. The findings from a thyroid examination are usually normal, but a goiter may be present in some patients. The presence of a scar on the neck might suggest postsurgical hypothyroidism and may be an important clue in the diagnosis of a patient who is comatose. A neurologic examination may reveal decreased reflex tendon relaxation and will invariably reveal altered mentation.


===Early Symptoms===
•	Hard stools or constipation

•	Increased sensitivity to cold

•	Fatigue or feeling slowed down 

•	Heavier menstrual periods

•	Joint or muscle pain

•	Paleness or dry skin

•	Sadness or depression

•	Thin, brittle hair or fingernails

•	Weakness

•	Weight gain without trying 


===Late Symptoms===
•	Weight gain

•	Slow speech

•	Pale skin

•	Swelling of leg (edema)

•	Muscular cramps

•	Shortness of breath

•	Absence of sweat

•	Secretion of milk from breast

•	Loss of hearing sensations

•	Reduced taste sensations

•	Lowered sense of smell

•	Absence of menstrual periods

•	Rise in menstrual bleeding

==Variants==

* ''Hyperthyroid myxedema'' is associated with [[hyperthyroidism]], and typically presents in specific areas ([[pretibial myxedema]] and [[exophthalmos]]) and is related to high levels of [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] receptor stimulation and/or inflammation mounted against the [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] receptor itself.  Myxedema of the lower legs (called [[pretibial myxedema]]), can occur in one to four percent of patients with [[Graves' disease]]—a condition that causes [[hyperthyroidism]]—or in patients with hypothyroid myxedema.<ref name="thedoctorsdoctor pretibial myxedema">[http://www.thedoctorsdoctor.com/diseases/pretibial_myxedema.htm "Pretibial Myxedema"], Retrieved on 2009-3-27</ref>

* ''Hypothyroid myxedema'' is used to describe the clinical syndrome secondary to [[hypothyroidism]]. Used in this way, myxedema can be considered the adult counterpart of [[cretinism]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|five/000069929|myxedema}}</ref>

:[[Myxedema coma]] is a condition which can occur with or without myxedema.

==Cause==
The increased deposition of [[glycosaminoglycan]] is not fully understood, however two mechanisms predominate. 
* Exophthalmos in particular results from [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] receptor stimulation on fibroblasts behind the eyes which leads to increased [[glycosaminoglycan]] deposition. It is thought that many cells responsible for forming connective tissue react to increases in [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] levels. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
* Secondarily, in autoimmune thyroid diseases lymphocytes react to the [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] receptor. Thus, in addition to the inflammation within the thyroid, any tissue with cells expressing the [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] receptor will likely experience lymphocytic infiltrates as well. The inflammation can cause tissue damage and scar tissue formation, explaining the deposition of [[glycosaminoglycans]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The increased deposition of [[glycosaminoglycans]] causes an osmotic edema and fluid collection.

[[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]], an autoimmune condition, is the most common cause of myxedema in the United States.<ref>[http://www.medicinenet.com/hashimotos_thyroiditis/article.htm "Hasihimotos Thyroiditis"], Retrieved on 2009-3-27</ref>
