An '''Aeroallergen''' (''pronounced aer·o·al·ler·gen'') is any [[wikt:airborne|airborne]] substance, such as [[pollen]] or [[spore]]s, which triggers an [[allergic reaction]].

==Pollens==
{{main|Rhinitis}}
{{see also|Hay fever}}
Aeroallergens include the pollens of specific seasonal plants is commonly known as "[[hay fever]]", because it is most prevalent during [[hay]]ing season, from late May to the end of June in the Northern Hemisphere; but it is possible to suffer from hay fever throughout the year.

The pollen which causes hay fever varies from person to person and from region to region; generally speaking, the tiny, hardly visible pollens of [[Anemophily|wind-pollinated]] plants are the predominant cause. Pollens of [[entomophily|insect-pollinated]] plants are too large to remain airborne and pose no risk.

Examples of plant pollen commonly responsible for hay fever include:
* Trees: such as birch (''[[Betula]]''), alder (''[[Alnus]]''), cedar (''[[Cedrus]]''), hazel (''[[Corylus]]''), hornbeam (''[[Carpinus]]''), horse chestnut (''[[Aesculus]]''), willow (''[[Salix]]''), [[poplar]] (''Populus''), plane (''[[Platanus]]''), linden/lime (''[[Tilia]]'') and olive (''[[Olea]]'').  In northern latitudes birch is considered to be the most important allergenic tree pollen, with an estimated 15–20% of hay fever sufferers sensitive to birch pollen grains. Olive pollen is most predominant in Mediterranean regions.
* Grasses (Family [[Poaceae]]): especially [[ryegrass]] (''Lolium'' sp.) and [[Timothy-grass|timothy]] (''Phleum pratense'').  An estimated 90% of hay fever sufferers are allergic to grass pollen.
* Weeds: [[ragweed]] (''Ambrosia''), plantain  (''[[Plantago]]''), [[nettle]]/parietaria ([[Urticaceae]]), [[mugwort]] (''Artemisia''), Fat hen (''[[Chenopodium]]'') and [[sorrel]]/dock (''[[Rumex]]'')

The time of year at which hay fever symptoms manifest themselves varies greatly depending on the types of pollen to which an allergic reaction is produced. The pollen count, in general, is highest from mid-spring to early summer. As most pollens are produced at fixed periods in the year, a long-term hay fever sufferer may also be able to anticipate when the symptoms are most likely to begin and end, although this may be complicated by an allergy to dust particles.

==Spores==
{{main|Spore}}
[[File:Fungus spore ejection.ogg|thumb|right|Spores being ejected by fungi.]]
In fungi, both asexual and sexual spores or sporangiospores of many fungal species are actively dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures, which travel through the air over long distances. Many fungi thereby possess specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms as well as spore-surface structures, such as [[hydrophobin]]s, for spore ejection. These mechanisms include, for example, forcible discharge of ascospores enabled by the structure of the ascus and accumulation of [[osmolyte]]s in the fluids of the ascus that lead to explosive discharge of the ascospores into the air.<ref name="Trail">{{cite journal|author=Trail F.|year= 2007|title=Fungal cannons: explosive spore discharge in the Ascomycota|journal=FEMS Microbiology Letterrs|volume=276|pages=12–8|pmid=17784861|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00900.x|issue=1}}</ref> The forcible discharge of single spores termed ''ballistospores'' involves formation of a small drop of water ([[Buller's drop]]), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000 [[G-force|g]].<ref name="Pringle et al">{{cite journal|author=Pringle A, Patek SN, Fischer M, Stolze J, Money NP.|year= 2005|title=The captured launch of a ballistospore|journal=[[Mycologia]]|volume=97|pages=866–71|pmid=16457355|doi=10.3852/mycologia.97.4.866|issue=4}}</ref> Other fungi rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces, exemplified by [[puffballs]].

==Foodstuffs==
It is thought that [[peanut]]s and other allergic foodstuffs may become airborne, thus triggering allergic reactions in susceptible individuals, especially children.<ref>The Michael C.

However, one report notes:
{{quote|Recently concern has been raised that peanut protein in the air will trigger a full-blown anaphylaxis since respiratory exposure can occur in the school setting as food proteins aerosolize into vapors during cooking at high temperatures, even in well-ventilated cafeterias. When airborne peanut protein exposure and reactions of children with known peanut allergies were explored, no allergic symptoms or anaphylaxis were observed when peanut allergic children were not aware of the airborne exposure. Interestingly, when aware of the exposure, symptoms of itchy eyes, sneezing, and runny nose resulted. In a research article by Perry, et al. (2004), no peanut allergen was detected in the air after subjects consumed peanut butter, shelled peanuts, and unshelled peanuts. As Dr. Michael Young notes in his 2006 book, ''The Peanut Allergy Answer Book'', predicting who will have a life-threatening anaphylactic response to airborne allergy is very unpredictable and the likelihood of it is very, very small. ... There remains no evidence that exposure to airborne peanut protein worsens allergy or results in anaphylaxis for the majority of peanut allergic individuals.  There always remains the possibility that someone who is exceptionally sensitive will experience a severe reaction, however, protecting them from all possible exposures to peanut protein is extremely difficult.|NetWellness website<ref>Jill F.

==Eosinophilic gastroenteritis==
{{main|Eosinophilic gastroenteritis}}
Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EG) is a rare and heterogeneous condition characterized by patchy or diffuse [[eosinophilic]] infiltration of [[gastrointestinal]] (GI) tissue, first described by Kaijser in 1937

It is possible that different [[pathogenesis|pathogenetic]] mechanisms of disease is involved in several subgroups of patients. Food [[allergy]] and variable [[IgE]] response to food substances has been observed in some patients which implies role of [[Hypersensitivity|hypersensitive]] response in pathogenesis. Many patients indeed have history of other [[atopy|atopic]] conditions like [[eczema]], [[asthma]] etc.

Eosinophil recruitment into inflammatory tissue is a complex process, regulated by a number of [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] [[cytokines]]. In EG [[cytokines]] [[Interleukin 3|IL-3]], [[Interleukin 5|IL-5]] and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor ([[GM-CSF]]) may be behind the recruitement and activation. They have been observed [[immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemically]] in diseased intestinal wall

EG is "managed" (treated) with [[corticosteroid]]s, with a 90% response rate in some studies.
