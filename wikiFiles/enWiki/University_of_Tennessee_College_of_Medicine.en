The '''University of Tennessee College of Medicine''' is one of six [[graduate schools]] of the [[University of Tennessee Health Science Center]] (UTHSC) in downtown [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. The oldest [[Public university|public]] [[medical school]] in [[Tennessee]], the UT College of Medicine is a [[Liaison Committee on Medical Education|LCME]]-accredited member of the [[American Association of Medical Colleges]] (AAMC) and awards graduates of the four-year program [[Doctor of Medicine|Doctor of Medicine (MD)]] degrees. The college's primary focus is to provide practicing health professionals for the state of [[Tennessee]].

==History==
The history of the University of Tennessee College of Medicine involves several institutional mergers. The Nashville Medical College was founded in 1876 and acquired by the [[University of Tennessee]] three years later. The Nashville Medical College moved to Memphis in 1911 and merged with the College of Physicians and Surgeons to become the University of Tennessee College of Medicine. Following a number of mergers with the biological science, [[nursing]], and [[University of Tennessee College of Dentistry|dental]] departments, the then-named University of Tennessee Medical Units was renamed the [[University of Tennessee Health Science Center]] during the tenure of Dr. Edmund Pellegrino.

Today, the Humphrey's General Education Building (GEB) stands on the corner of Madison Avenue and Dunlap street, where Lindsley Hall formerly housed the College of Physicians and Surgeons. The oldest surviving building (built in 1926) of the current UTHSC campus is the Wittenborg Anatomy Building, named after Dr. August H. Wittenborg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://medicine.uthsc.edu/StudentAffairs/inc/uthistory.html|title=A brief history of the UT College of Medicine|author=Hershel P.

The College of Medicine is affiliated with a number of teaching hospitals in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]],  [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. The [[University of Tennessee Health Science Center]] forms the backbone of the [[Medical District, Memphis|Memphis Medical District]] and is closely affiliated with several medical units:

*Baptist Medical Center
*Campbell Clinic in Orthopedics
*Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center
*[[Hamilton Eye Institute]]
*[[Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center]]
*Methodist University Hospital
*Regional Medical Center of Memphis (The MED)
*Semmes-Murphey Neurologic and Spine Institute
*[[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]]
*University of Tennessee Medical Group (UTMG)

The Chattanooga campus of the College of Medicine is closely affiliated with [[Erlanger Health System (Chattanooga, Tennessee)|Erlanger Health System]]. In Knoxville, the [[University of Tennessee Medical Center]] is home to the UT Graduate School of Medicine, the largest of the nine (AAMC) Graduate Regional Medical Centers in the Southeast United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uthsc.edu/news/publications/factsheet_com.pdf|title=UTCOM Fact Sheet|publisher=Uthsc.edu|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}</ref>

Nashville UTHSC CoM affiliates include St. Thomas and Baptist Hospitals. Steve Schwab announced in 2013 that UTHSC aims to develop more clinical experiences for students in internal medicine, surgery, surgical sub-specialties (e.g., [[Anesthesiology]] and [[Radiology]]), family medicine, emergency medicine, and obstetrics and gynecology at these hospitals.

UT [[medical students]] spend their first two years in Memphis completing basic science coursework prior to taking the [[USMLE Step 1]]. Then, students perform clinical rotations at these facilities on all three campuses for third and fourth year clerkships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uthsc.edu/Medicine/index.php?doc=./dean.htm|title=Office of the Executive Dean|publisher=Uthsc.edu|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}</ref>
