'''Emergency medical responders''' are people who are specially trained to provide out-of-hospital care in [[medical emergency|medical emergencies]].  There are many different types of emergency medical responders, each with different levels of training, ranging from [[first aid]] and [[basic life support]] to [[advanced life support]].  Terms may have different meanings with different training requirements in different countries.

== General terms ==

[[Medic]] is a term that may be used to denote a wide range of trained medical responders, from people who provide basic first aid to [[physician]]s.  Usage of medic does not imply that the individual provides any specific level of care.  In some areas, [[paramedic]] is also used as a general term for medical responders.  However, paramedic may also be a specific level of training.

A [[first responder]] is the first medically trained personnel who come in to contact with a patient.  Additionally, there are several levels of training that are referred to as first responders.

== Levels of training ==

First responders, as a level of training, perform basic [[first aid]] skills and [[CPR]].  Healthcare providers who are [[certified first responder]]s (known as [[community first responder]]s in the UK) have some additional training in basic life support.  These responders may either be lay people or associated with an [[ambulance]] service. In the US the term "Emergency Medical Responder" will largely replace the term "Certified First Responder" beginning 2012.<ref>"[https://www.nremt.org/nremt/about/nremt_news.asp NREMT News]", National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians, Columbus, Ohio, 2011 [cited 9 October 2011].</ref>

[[Emergency medical technician]]s (EMT) are the next level of providers.  Within the United States, there are three common levels of EMTs, each with an increased [[scope of practice]]: [[Emergency medical technician-basic|EMT-Basic]], [[EMT-Intermediate]], and EMT-Paramedic (also known as a paramedic).

[[Paramedic]]s have the most training of the emergency medical responders.  Paramedics perform [[advanced life support]].

[[Emergency physician]]s may also respond to serious medical emergencies.  Depending on the location, physicians may work on an [[ambulance]], an [[air ambulance]], or use a [[fly-car]].

== Additional types ==

In the field of [[wilderness first aid]], medical providers receive additional training relating to [[wilderness medicine]].  There are several levels of certification that parallel the aforementioned levels, which include [[Wilderness First Responder]] and [[Wilderness Emergency Medical Technician]].

[[Street medic]]s provide medical care at [[protests]] and demonstrations.  They have varying degrees of medical training and are usually volunteers.

[[Flight medic]]s are usually trained paramedics who may receive an additional certification ([[FP-C]]) to function in an aeromedical environment.  Flight medics work out of an [[air ambulance]].

A [[combat medic]] is a trained [[soldier]] who is responsible for providing first aid and front-line trauma care on the [[battle|battlefield]].  In the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] of the [[British Army]], these medics are known as [[Combat Medical Technician]].  In the [[United States Army]], these healthcare specialists are known as [[68W]] (the [[Military Occupational Specialty]] classification).
