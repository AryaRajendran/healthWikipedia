==Life and career==

Born in Budapest, Hungary in 1944, he is a survivor of the Nazi genocide.  His maternal grandparents were killed in Auschwitz when he was five months old, his aunt disappeared during the war, and his father endured forced labour at the hands of the Nazis.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mate|first=Gabor|title=When the Body Says No:  The Cost of Hidden Stress|year=2003|publisher=Vintage Canada|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-676-97312-9|pages=10–11}}</ref>   He emigrated to Canada with his family in 1957. After graduating with a B.A. from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and a few years as a high school English and literature teacher, he returned to school to pursue his childhood dream of being a physician.

Maté ran a private family practice in East Vancouver for over twenty years. He was also the medical co-ordinator of the Palliative Care Unit at Vancouver Hospital for seven years. Currently he is the staff physician at the Portland Hotel, a residence and resource centre for the people of Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. Many of his patients suffer from mental illness, drug addiction and HIV, or all three. He works in [[harm reduction]] clinics in [[Vancouver]]'s [[Downtown Eastside]]. Most recently, he has written about his experiences working with addicts in ''In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts.''<ref name="dn ghosts">{{Cite episode |title="In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts": Dr. Gabor Maté, Physician at Vancouver Safe-Injection Site, on the Biological and Socio-Economic Roots of Addiction and ADD |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/2/3/addiction |accessdate=2011-01-14|series=[[Democracy Now!]]|airdate=2010-02-03}}</ref>

He made national headlines in defense of the physicians working at [[Insite]] (a legal supervised safe injection site) after the federal Minister of Health, [[Tony Clement]], attacked them as unethical.<ref>{{Cite web

==Writings and views==

A recurring theme in his books is the impact of a person's childhood on their mental and physical health through neurological and psychological mechanisms, which he connects with the need for [[social change]]. In the book ''In the Realm of the Hungry Ghosts'', he proposes new approaches to treating addiction (e.g. safe injection sites) based on an understanding of the biological and socio-economic roots of addiction.<ref name="dn ghosts"/> He describes the significant role of "early adversity" i.e. stress, mistreatment and particularly childhood abuse, in increasing susceptibility to addiction.<ref name="dn ghosts"/> This happens through the impairment of [[neurobiological]] development, impairing the brain circuitry involved in addiction, motivation and incentive.<ref name="dn ghosts"/> He argues the "war on drugs" actually punishes people for having been abused and entrenches addiction more deeply as studies show that stress is the biggest driver of addictive relapse and behavior.<ref name="dn ghosts"/> He says a system that marginalizes, ostracizes and institutionalizes people in facilities with no care and easy access to drugs, only worsens the problem.<ref name="dn ghosts"/> He also argues the environmental causes of addiction point to the need to improve child welfare policies (e.g. U.S. welfare laws that force many single women to find low-paying jobs far away from home and their children) and the need for better support for families overall, as most children in North America are now away from their parents from an early age due to economic conditions.<ref name="dn ghosts"/> He feels that society needs to change policies that disadvantage certain minority groups, causing them more stress and therefore increased risks for addictions.<ref name="dn ghosts"/>

The impact of childhood adversity is also noted in ''When the Body Says No: Understanding the Stress-Disease Connection''.<ref name="stresscnx">{{Cite episode |title=Dr. Gabor Maté: "When the Body Says No: Understanding the Stress-Disease Connection" |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/2/15/dr_gabor_mat_when_the_body |accessdate=2011-01-18|series=[[Democracy Now!]]|airdate=2010-02-15}}</ref> He notes that early experiences have a key role in shaping a person's perceptions of the world and others, and in stress physiology, factors that affect the person's health later on. He says that emotional patterns ingrained in childhood live in the memory of cells and the brain and appear in interpersonal interactions.<ref name="stresscnx"/> He describes the impact of 'adverse childhood experiences' or ACEs (e.g. a child being abused, violence in the family, a jailed parent, extreme stress of poverty, a rancorous divorce, an addict parent, etc.) on how people live their lives and their risk of addiction and mental and physical illnesses, as seen in a number of U.S.-based ACE studies. Having a number of ACEs exponentially increases a person's chances of becoming an addict later on e.g. a male child with six ACEs has a 4,600% or 46-fold increase in risk.<ref name="stresscnx" /> ACEs also exponentially increase the risk of diseases e.g. cancer, high blood pressure, heart disease, etc. and also suicide and early death.<ref name="stresscnx" />

He argues that patients should therefore be encouraged to explore their childhoods and the impact on their adult behaviors. Overall, he argues people benefit by taking a holistic approach to their own health. For instance, he has seen people survive supposedly terminal diagnoses by seriously considering their "mind-body unity" and "spiritual unity"; going beyond "the medical model of treatment."<ref name="stresscnx"/>

He has also spoken about how the rise in bullying, [[ADHD]] and other mental disorders in American children are the result of current societal conditions e.g. a disconnected society and "the loss of nurturing, non-stressed parenting."<ref name="dn kids">{{Cite episode |title=Dr. Gabor Maté on ADHD, Bullying and the Destruction of American Childhood |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/11/24/dr_gabor_mat_on_adhd_bullying |accessdate=2011-01-14|series=[[Democracy Now!]]|airdate=2010-11-24}}</ref> That is, we live in a society where for the first time in history, children are spending most of their time away from nurturing adults. He asserts that nurturing adults are necessary for healthy brain development.<ref name="dn kids" />
