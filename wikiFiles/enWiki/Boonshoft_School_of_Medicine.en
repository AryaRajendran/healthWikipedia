'''Boonshoft School of Medicine''' (formerly known as The Wright State University School of Medicine) is the medical school at [[Wright State University]]. Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine is located in [[Dayton, Ohio]], and serves the Miami Valley region of southwestern Ohio. 

Instead of operating a university-based hospital for clinical training, Wright State is affiliated with seven major [[teaching hospitals]] in the Greater Dayton area and has formal affiliation agreements with more than 25 other health care institutions in the Miami Valley.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.med.wright.edu/about/|title= About Boonshoft School of Medicine|accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref> 

Admission to Wright State University's School of Medicine is competitive among the many students who apply; in 2012, over 3,666 students applied for admission to the school, and 103 matriculated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.med.wright.edu/about/facts|title= Facts at a Glance|accessdate=2013-01-30}}</ref>

The Boonshoft School of Medicine is accredited by the [[Liaison Committee on Medical Education]] ([[LCME]]).

==History==
In 1972, Congress passed the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] Medical School Assistance and Health Manpower Training Act, also known as the Teague Cranston Act, which provided financial support for establishing five new U.S. [[medical schools]], including one at Wright State University. The VA awarded the school a $19.5 million, seven-year grant for faculty support and facilities. Other major founding donors included Mrs. Virginia Kettering, who contributed $1 million in unrestricted funds, and the Fordham Foundation, which provided $500,000 for a medical library. The school was established by the [[Ohio General Assembly]] in 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.med.wright.edu/about/history|title= Boonshoft's history|accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref>

The school's [[charter]] class began studies in 1976 and graduated in 1980. Since then, more than 2,820 physicians have graduated from the School of Medicine. Wright State [[alumni]] are practicing in almost every state in the nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.med.wright.edu/about/history|title= Boonshoft's history and information|accessdate=2012-01-30}}</ref> 

In 2005, the school changed its name to the Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine in recognition of the Oscar Boonshoft family, which gave Wright State's largest [[philanthropic]] gift to the medical school.

In 2009, the school became the first medical school in the United States to debut its own medical student produced radio program, dubbed [[Radio Rounds]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.med.wright.edu/sites/default/files/vitalsigns/2009/radiorounds.pdf|title= Radio Rounds gets around|accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref>
