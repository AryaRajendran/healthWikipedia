{{nihongo|'''Mosuke Murata'''|村田 茂助|Murata Mosuke|extra=}} is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] dermatologist and was the designator of ''erythema nodosum leprosum'' (ENL)(1912), the type 2 [[Leprosy|lepra]] reaction.

==Life and works==
Mosuke Murata joined the Zensho Byoin, now [[Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium]] in 1909. The chief dermatologist was [[Kensuke Mitsuda]] and there was another doctor Chin. Murata belonged to the surgery section, and studied [[leprosy]]. He was known for naming a hot nodule of leprosy, ''erythema nodosum leprosum'' (ENL). There was need to differentiate it from other types of ''erythema nodosum'', which is usually seen in the lower parts of the body. In his paper, he thanked [[Kensuke Mitsuda]] for allowing him to study a total of 67 cases.<ref>Mosuke Murata, the designator of erythema nodosum leprosum(2009), Kikuchi I.

==Erythema Nodosum Leprosum==
''Erythema nodosum leprosum'' is one of the most frequently used terms in the science of leprosy.  It is an immune-mediated complication of leprosy presenting with inflammatory skin nodules. Immune complex production and deposition as well as complement activation have long been regarded as the principal etiology of ENL. ENL is characterised by an inflammatory infiltrate of neutrophils with vasculitis. There is deposition of immune complexes and complement together with Mycobacterium leprae antigens in the skin.

==Term's origin==
[[William Jopling]] wanted to know who named this condition erythema nodosum leprosum, and asked every visitor to his Jordan Hospital, a leprosy hospital (1950–1967) near London.<ref>Reflections and recollections(1992), Jopling W. The Star, March/April, 51,5-10.</ref> Yoshinobu Hayashi, the director of [[Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium]] visited the hospital and brought the information <ref>Hayashi Y(December,1956), Attending the Rome International Leprosy Conference, Tama, 2-12</ref>
