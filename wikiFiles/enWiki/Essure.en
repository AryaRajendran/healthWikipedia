'''Essure''' is a permanent, non-surgical [[transcervical sterilization]] procedure for women developed by [[Conceptus Inc.]] It was approved for use in the United States on November 4, 2002.<ref name="FDA"/>

Two economic studies, one of which implemented Essure as an in-office procedure, suggest that Essure could be more cost-effective than [[laparoscope|laparoscopic]] bilateral [[tubal ligation]].<ref name=Hurskainen/>

==Procedure==
Small, flexible inserts are placed into the [[fallopian tubes]] by a catheter passed from the [[vagina]] through the [[cervix]] and [[uterus]]. The insert contains inner polyethylene terephthalate fibers to induce benign fibrotic reaction and is held in place by flexible stainless steel inner coil and a dynamic outer nickel titanium alloy coil.<ref>Miño M, Arjona JE, Cordón J, Pelegrin B, Povedano B, Chacon E. Success rate and patient satisfaction with the Essure sterilisation in an outpatient setting: a prospective study of 857 women. BJOG. 2007 Jun;114(6):763-6.</ref> Once in place, the device is designed to elicit tissue growth in and around the insert over a period of three months to form an occlusion or blockage in the fallopian tubes; the tissue barrier formed prevents [[spermatozoon|sperm]] from reaching an egg.

Unlike other forms of [[tubal ligation]], no general anaesthetic nor incision through the abdomen is required. 

Similar to some other methods of [[birth control]], initially additional forms of [[birth control]] must be continued for 3 months<ref name=Hurskainen>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.02.080}}</ref> to prevent [[pregnancy]] until the method's effectiveness can be confirmed.

===Follow-up===
For the Essure method, three months after insertion a physician performs an x-ray test called a [[hysterosalpingogram]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essure.com/Home/Understanding/EssureConfirmationTest/tabid/187/Default.aspx|title=Essure Confirmation Test|publisher=Conceptus Inc|accessdate=2011-05-30}}</ref> to confirm that the [[fallopian tubes]] are completely blocked and that the patient can rely on the Essure inserts for birth control.<ref name="FDA">{{cite web | title=Essure{{tm}} System - P020014 | url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/Recently-ApprovedDevices/ucm083087.htm | date=06/29/2009  | publisher=US [[Food and Drug Administration]] | accessdate=2011-05-21}}</ref> A contrast agent (dye) is injected through the cervix, and an x-ray technologist takes photos of the Essure coils to ensure that they are in place.

==Efficacy==

Following successful insertion and occlusional response, the Essure procedure is 99.74% effective based on 5 years of follow-up, with zero pregnancies reported in clinical trials.<ref>{{cite web | title=Clinical Testing | url=http://essure.com/EssurePermanentBirth control methodsbyConceptus/Understanding/ClinicalTesting/tabid/58/Default.aspx | work=Essure | publisher=Conceptus | accessdate=2006-12-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name="pmid19716128">{{cite journal |author=Smith RD |title=Contemporary hysteroscopic methods for female sterilization |journal=Int J Gynaecol Obstet |volume=108 |issue=1 |pages=79–84 |year=2010 |month=January |pmid=19716128 |doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2009.07.026 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020-7292(09)00399-3}}</ref>

The reported insertional failure rates are "failure to place 2 inserts in the first procedure (5%), initial tubal patency (3.5%), expulsion (2.2%), perforation (1.8%), or other unsatisfactory device location (0.6%)".<ref name="Precribing"/> Upon follow-up, occlusion is observed to have occurred in 96.5% of patients at 3 months with the remainder occluded by 6 months.<ref name="FDA"/>

==Cautions and warnings==
The inserts do not prevent the transmission of [[sexually transmitted diseases]]. The procedure takes about 10 minutes<ref>http://www.marketwatch.com/story/conceptusr-to-promote-gynecare-thermachoicer-to-us-physician-offices-2010-11-10?reflink=MW_news_stmp</ref> for a trained physician to perform and can be performed in a physician's office. General [[anesthesia]] is not required. Unlike many temporary methods of [[birth control]], the Essure inserts do not contain or release [[hormones]].

The inserts are made from [[polyester]] fibers, [[nickel]]-[[titanium]] and [[stainless steel]] and are safe to use with [[MRI]] equipment.<!--

The Essure procedure is reported to be permanent and not reversible by the manufacturing company.  Notwithstanding the manufacturer's position, several Essure reversals have been performed.<ref name="reversal">{{cite web | title=Doctors Confirm First Successful Essure Tubal Ligation Reversal|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/125033.php|date=2008-10-08|accessdate=2010-02-15}}, referring to Dr. William A.C. Greene Jr. and Dr. Wendell Turner at Lakeshore Surgical Center</ref>

Additional birth control must be used for three months after procedure.<ref name="Precribing">{{cite web | title=Prescribing Information | url=http://www.essuremd.com/Portals/0/Skins/Conceptus_Skin/PDFs/CC-0366-prescribing-info.pdf | format=PDF | work=Essure | date=2005-09-08 | publisher=Conceptus | accessdate=2006-12-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061111074217/http://www.essuremd.com/Portals/0/Skins/Conceptus_Skin/PDFs/CC-0366-prescribing-info.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-11-11}}</ref><ref name="pmid19409549">{{cite journal |author=Hurskainen R, Hovi SL, Gissler M, ''et al.'' |title=Hysteroscopic tubal sterilization: a systematic review of the Essure system |journal=Fertil.

===Risks===
* Perforation, expulsion, or other unsatisfactory location of the insert
