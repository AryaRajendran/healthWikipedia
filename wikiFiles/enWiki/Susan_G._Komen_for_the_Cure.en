==Philosophy==
Komen advocates for breast self-awareness as a primary method for fighting breast cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dglobe.com/event/article/id/45421|title=Digital mammography reaches Worthington|date=January 30, 2011|accessdate=April 26, 2011|work=[[Worthington Daily Globe]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/BreastSelfAwareness.html |title=Understanding Breast Cancer &#124; Breast Self-Awareness |publisher=Susan G.

Their response to scientific evidence that the indiscriminate nature of [[screening mammography]] for all middle-aged and older women, regardless of each woman's individual risk of developing breast cancer, results in [[overtreatment]] of some women whose cancer would regress on its own or would grow so slowly that it would never harm them—for every one woman whose life is saved by screening mammography, between two and ten women will receive completely unnecessary and toxic treatment for a harmless growth, 250 to 500 women will be wrongly told that they might have breast cancer ([[false positive]]s), and 125 to 250 will have biopsies performed<ref>{{cite book

By contrast, organizations like the [[National Breast Cancer Coalition]] follow a [[medical consumerism]] model, in which individual women are educated by their physicians about their options and encouraged to make individualized, [[evidence-based]] decisions about their health care.<ref name=Suliksplit />  Other organizations advocate more research into the environmental causes of breast cancer and [[cancer prevention]].<ref name=Suliksplit>Sulik, 2010.  pages 52–53.</ref>

The Komen CEO salary in 2010 was $459,406 a year.<ref>[http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2010/10/sink_pink.single.html A new book takes down Breast Cancer Awareness Month (Slate, Oct. 29, 2010)]</ref> Komen paid founder and CEO Nancy Brinker $417,712 in 2011.<ref name="REUTERS">[http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/08/us-usa-healthcare-komen-research-idUSTRE8171KW20120208 Komen charity under microscope for funding, science (Reuters)]</ref>

===Grants and awards===
Since its foundation in 1982, Komen has provided funding for basic, clinical, and [[Translational medicine|translational]] breast cancer research and for innovative projects in the areas of breast health education and breast cancer screening and treatment. The organization has awarded more than 1,000 breast cancer research grants totaling more than $180 million.<ref name="Grants">{{cite web |url=http://cms.komen.org/komen/GrantsAwards/index.htm |title=Komen Grants & Awards |publisher=Susan G. Komen for the Cure official page |accessdate = 2007-03-30}}</ref> Komen adheres to a peer-review process that is recognized by the US [[National Cancer Institute]].

{{As of|2007}}, research grants are available for basic, clinical, and translational research; postdoctoral fellowships; and breast cancer disparities research.<ref>[http://cms.komen.org/Komen/GrantsAwards/ResearchGrants/index.htm "Research Grants"].  Susan G. Komen for the Cure official page. Retrieved 2007-02-18.</ref>

Komen awards three-year postdoctoral fellowships to individuals working under the guidance of experienced cancer researchers in order to recruit and retain young scientists in the field of breast cancer research.
In addition to funding research, Komen and its affiliates fund non-duplicative, community-based breast health education and breast cancer screening and treatment projects for the medically under-served.<ref name="Grants" />

Since 1992, Komen has also annually awarded work in the field of cancer research with the [[Komen Brinker Award for Scientific Distinction]].

In recent years, Komen has cut by nearly half the proportion of fund-raising dollars it spends on research grants, according to a 2012 [[Reuters]] analysis. In 2011, the foundation spent $63 million (15 percent) of its donations on research grants and awards.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/08/us-usa-healthcare-komen-research-idUSTRE8171KW20120208 Komen charity under microscope for funding, science, By Sharon Begley and Janet Roberts, Reuters, Feb 8, 2012]</ref><ref>[http://link.reuters.com/huv46s Breast cancer charity Komen's spending (Reuters)]</ref><ref>[http://ww5.komen.org/uploadedFiles/Content/AboutUs/Financial/2011%20Komen%20Financial%20Statements%20FINAL(3).pdf 2010-2011 Final Audited Financial Statements]</ref> In 2012, [[WWE]] formed a partnership with Susan G. Komen for the Cure to promote breast cancer awareness. As part of the campaign, WWE adorned their sets with pink ribbons, put a pink middle rope on the ring, filmed numerous PSAs, and sold special John Cena "Rise Above Cancer" merchandise. All of these efforts culminated in a donation from WWE of $1 Million, which was presented to Susan G. Komen representatives in an in-ring ceremony during the October 29, 2012 episode of Raw.<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wwe#Social_Media.2C_TV-PG.2C_and_Public_Service_Initiatives</ref>

===Global activities===
Around 458,000 people worldwide die from breast cancer every year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/index.html |title=Cancer Fact Sheet |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate = 2007-04-11 }}</ref> Komen for the Cure states that its aim is to "reduce the burden of breast cancer on a global level". Believing that no single approach to breast health will prove effective around the world, Komen works with local communities and organizations to develop programs for particular groups or cultures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cms.komen.org/komen/AboutUs/OurGlobalReach/index.htm |title=Susan G. Komen for the Cure: Our Global Reach |accessdate = 2007-04-11}}</ref>

In 2006, Susan G. Komen for the Cure announced their involvement with the [[US-Middle East Partnership for Breast Cancer Awareness and Research]], a [[Middle East Partnership Initiative]] program that unites leading breast cancer advocates in the U.S. and the Middle East with the goal increasing early detection of breast cancer and reduce mortality through improved awareness, increased clinical resources, and research.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bcpartnership.org/about-us/ | title = About Us | publisher = [[US-Middle East Partnership for Breast Cancer Awareness and Research]] | location = [[Fairfax, Virginia]] | accessdate = 2009-05-09 }}</ref>

Today, Susan G.

On October 28, 2010, Jerusalem, Israel held its first Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure. Over 5,000 Christian, Muslim and Jewish people walked and ran to show solidarity in what was described as a historic event.<ref>{{cite news|last=Eglash |first=Ruth |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=193177 |title=‘Race for the Cure’ braves J'lem traffic in historic march |publisher=Jerusalem Post |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2012-10-26}}</ref> The main goal of the race was to raise awareness of breast cancer and establish the organization as a permanent fixture in Israel. Prior to the Race the Old City walls of Jerusalem were illuminated pink by Komen founder Nancy G. Brinker, Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat and the Prime Minister's wife Sara Netanyahu.

==Fundraising==

===Cause marketing===
The Organization raises over $35 million a year from over 60 [[cause marketing]] partnerships.  These include prominent campaigns, such as those with [[Yoplait]], which runs the Save Lids to Save Lives program, and a partnership with [[American Airlines]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.causemarketingforum.com/page.asp?ID=197 |title=Cindy Schneible, VP Cause MarketingSusan G. Komen Breast Cancer Fndn. - Cause Marketing Forum - Cause Related Marketing Source |publisher=Cause Marketing Forum |date=2003-06-19 |accessdate=2010-06-12}}</ref>

Cause marketing allows Komen to associate the breast cancer [[brand (marketing)|brand]] with its organization.  by promoting the "fear, hope and goodness" associated with the breast cancer brand, Komen is able to promote itself, [[breast cancer awareness]], its sponsoring corporations, and [[conscientious consumption]].<ref>Sulik, 2010. pages 133-146.</ref>

===Events===
[[Image:Racecure.png|right|thumb|Race for the Cure Logo]]

The '''Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure''' is the world's largest fundraising event for breast cancer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/palm-beach/fl-brinker-appointment-20091203,0,7987489.story |title=Topic Galleries - South Florida |publisher=Sun-Sentinel |date= |accessdate=2012-10-26}}</ref> It consists of a series of [[5k race|5K runs]] and fitness walks to raise money for [[breast cancer]], to raise awareness of the disease, to celebrate those who have survived breast cancer, and memorialize those who have not.  

The first race was run in [[Dallas, Texas]] in 1983, with 800 participants.<ref>[http://cms.komen.org/Komen/NewsEvents/RacefortheCure/index.htm Susan G. Komen for the Cure<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The 25th Anniversary of the Race was celebrated in 2008.  In 2009, it was renamed as Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/ext/share.php?sid=56354659628&h=1tJLC&u=6IfcV |title=Niet compatibele browser |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2010-06-12}}</ref>  In 2010, there were about 130 races worldwide.<ref name=Iam />  Additionally in 2010, over 1.6 million people participated in the race, which utilized over 100,000 volunteers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.komen.org/raceforthecure/ |title=Komen Race for the Cure |publisher=Susan G. Komen for the Cure |date= |accessdate=2012-10-26}}</ref>

The primary source of revenue for the event is [[donation]]s collected by the participants in the race. Three-quarters of the net proceeds from the event are used locally to pay for [[community outreach]] programs, breast health education, and [[breast cancer screening]] and treatment projects run by the Komen affiliate. The remaining quarter is sent to the central organization.<ref name=Iam>[http://www.iamthecure.org/about.aspx About Us], Komen's "I am the Cure" website, accessed 10 June 2011.</ref>

==Controversy and criticism==

===Pinkwashing in cause marketing===
Komen is a key entity in the controversy over "[[pinkwashing]]"—the use of breast cancer and the [[pink ribbon]] by corporate marketers, especially to promote products that might be unhealthy—in return for a donation to the cause. Komen benefits greatly from these corporate partnerships, receiving over $55 million a year<ref name="usatoday.com">{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/yourlife/health/medical/breastcancer/2010-09-30-Promisebook30_CV_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Liz | last=Szabo | title=A 'Promise' spurred Susan G.

The funds donated are to benefit breast cancer research, education, screening and treatment.

In April 2010, Komen paired with [[fast food restaurant]] chain [[KFC]] to offer "Buckets for the Cure," a promotion in which fried and grilled chicken was sold in pink branded buckets. The collaboration garnered criticism from media outlets including ''[[The Colbert Report]]''<ref>{{cite web

To critics of [[cause marketing]] the use of a potentially deadly disease as a marketing vehicle detracts from the original message; in the words of one member of the IV League, a group of terminal (Stage IV) breast cancer patients interviewed in the [[Léa Pool]] documentary [[Pink Ribbons, Inc.]], "It's like they're using our disease to profit and that's not OK."<ref name="CPwire-PinkRibbonsInc">{{Cite news

===Legal battles over trademarking===
In 2007, the organization changed its name to Susan G. Komen for the Cure and [[trademark]]ed the running ribbon as part of its new [[brand]]ing strategy.<ref>{{cite news | first=Gayle | last=Sulik| title=The Battle "For the Cure": The Phrase, That Is | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| date=2010-12-20 | url=http://blog.oup.com/2010/12/breast-cancer/| accessdate = 2010-12-28}}</ref> Komen has come under fire for legal action against other non-profits or organizations using the phrase "for the cure" within their names. An August 2010 article in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' detailed a case in which the organization Uniting Against Lung Cancer was told in a letter from Komen that they should no longer use the name "Kites for the Cure" for their annual fundraising event. Komen also wrote to the organization to warn them "against any use of pink in conjunction with 'cure.'"<ref>{{cite news | first=Clifford M.| last=Marks| title=Charity Brawl: Nonprofits Aren't So Generous When a Name's at Stake | publisher=Wall Street Journal| date=2010-08-05 | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703700904575390950178142586.html?mod=WSJ_WSJ_US_News_6#articleTabs%3Darticle| accessdate = 2010-09-01}}</ref> More than 100 small charities have received legal opposition from Komen regarding various uses of the words "for the cure" in their names.<ref name=Bassett /> Among the offending charitable organizations and events were "Par for the Cure," "Surfing for a Cure," "Cupcakes for a Cure" and "Mush for the Cure".<ref name=Bassett>{{cite news |title=Susan G. Komen Foundation Elbows Out Charities Over Use Of The Word 'Cure' |first=Laura |last=Bassett |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/07/komen-foundation-charities-cure_n_793176.html |newspaper=The Huffington Post |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref> 

Komen says that the organization protects its trademarks as a matter of financial stewardship and that they want to prevent confusion among donors. According to former Komen general counsel Jonathan Blum, a mixup could result in a donation being inadvertently sent to another charity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Susan G. Komen fights for trademark |first=Janet |last=Babin |work=North Carolina Public Radio |publisher=Marketplace |date=August 5, 2010 |url=http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2010/08/05/pm-susan-g-komen-fights-for-trademark/ }}</ref> 

Others suggest that the trademark issue is more about dominating the pink ribbon market.<ref>Sulik, 2010. pages 146-150.</ref>

The slogan itself implies to donors that the majority of Komen's funds go to research, specifically research to find a means to cure (and not merely treat or detect) the disease.{{According to whom|date=November 2012}} By Komen's own figures, however, 21% of the total budget goes to research.<ref name=AmericanProspect>{{cite news|title=Shopping for the Cure|first=Ellen|last=Leopold|url=http://prospect.org/article/shopping-cure|newspaper=The American Prospect|date=2001-10-07|accessdate=2012-02-08}}</ref>  In the words of one critic, "A organization that is actively pursuing other small charities over the use of the term 'for the cure' does not spend the majority of their own funds towards research for a cure."<ref>{{cite web|title=Lawsuits for the Cure|first=Alicia C.|last=Staley|url=http://community.wegohealth.com/profiles/blogs/lawsuits-for-the-cure|work=WegoHealth|date=2010-12-08|accessdate=2012-02-08}}</ref>

===Relationship with Planned Parenthood===
Beginning in 2007, Komen granted money to pay for 170,000 clinical breast exams and 6,400 [[mammogram]] referrals at the [[Planned Parenthood Federation of America]] and affiliates.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505266_162-57370205/komen-for-cure-planned-parenthood-sparks-fly/ Komen for Cure, Planned Parenthood sparks fly ([[CBS News]], February 2, 2012)]</ref><ref>[http://www.balloon-juice.com/2012/02/01/komens-house-of-cards/ Komen’s House of Cards]</ref> Komen had said its affiliates provide funds for screening, education and treatment programs in dozens of communities in which Planned Parenthood is the only place that poor, uninsured or under-insured women can receive these services.<ref>http://ww5.komen.org/Content.aspx?id=16162</ref><ref>http://ww5.komen.org/uploadedFiles/Content/Footer/MediaCenter/planned%20parenthood%20winer-09.pdf</ref> This partnership garnered criticism from [[pro-life]] advocates because some Planned Parenthood health centers perform abortions.

On January 31, 2012, Komen stopped funding Planned Parenthood, citing a congressional investigation by Rep. [[Cliff Stearns]] and a newly created internal rule about not funding organizations under any federal, state or local investigation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/02/top-susan-g-komen-official-resigned-over-planned-parenthood-cave-in/252405/ |title=Top Susan G.

In the 24 hours after the news broke, Planned Parenthood received more than $400,000 from 6,000 donors,<ref name="Seattle" /> followed by pledges of a $250,000 matching grant from [[New York City|New York]] Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]]<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/02/politics/planned-parenthood-bloomberg/?hpt=hp_t3 NYC mayor gives Planned Parenthood $250K matching grant ([[CNN]]), February 02, 2012)]</ref> and a $250,000 gift from a foundation run by the CEO of Bonanza Oil Co. in [[Dallas]] to replace the lost funding.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-02-02/planned-parenthood-replaces-komen-grant-with-online-push.html Planned Parenthood Replaces Komen Grant With Online Push ([[BusinessWeek]]), February 02, 2012)]</ref>

Four days later, Komen's Board of Directors reversed the decision and announced that it would amend the policy to "make clear that disqualifying investigations must be criminal and conclusive in nature and not political".<ref>[http://ww5.komen.org/KomenNewsArticle.aspx?id=19327354148 Statement from Susan G.

===Embryonic stem cell research===
{{Expand section|date=February 2012}}
Komen has also been criticized for ending funding for [[embryonic stem cell research]], beginning late in 2011, for suspected political reasons.<ref>{{cite news|author=The Madeleine Brand Show | February 3rd, 2012, 9:13am |url=http://www.scpr.org/programs/madeleine-brand/2012/02/03/22392/susan-g-komen-for-the-cure-foundation-reverses-its |title=Post-Planned Parenthood, stem cell research may be Komen's next controversy &#124; The Madeleine Brand Show |publisher=89.3 [[KPCC]] FM |date=2012-02-03 |accessdate=2012-10-26}}</ref> 

Potentially affected are millions of dollars funding cancer research at institutions such as [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]] and the [[U.S. National Cancer Institute]], which also conduct research using embryonic stem cells.<ref>[http://motherjones.com/mojo/2012/02/komen-stem-cell-research Komen's Position on Stem Cells Remains Unclear]</ref>

Komen has not clarified its current position on embryonic stem cell research, which it supported in 2006.<ref>[https://motherjones.com/files/cancer_stem_cell_research_shows_promise.pdf Cancer Stem Cell Research Shows Promise (Komen's frontline newsletter, Fall 2006)]</ref>
