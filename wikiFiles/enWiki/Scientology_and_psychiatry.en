'''Scientology and psychiatry''' have come into conflict since the founding of [[Scientology]] in 1952. Scientology is publicly, and often vehemently, opposed to both [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]].<ref>[http://www.scientology.org/en_US/religion/heritage/pg011.html] Scientology's views on the evils of [[materialism]].</ref><ref>{{Cite book | first=Paulette | last=Cooper | authorlink=Paulette Cooper | title=Scientology Versus Medicine in Scandal of Scientology | publisher =Web Edition| year=1997 | url= http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/tsos/sos-16.html }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last=Mieszkowskii | first=Katharine | title=Scientology's War on Psychiatry | journal= [[Salon.com]] | year=2005 | url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/01/sci_psy/index_np.html?pn=1}}</ref> Scientologists view psychiatry as a barbaric and corrupt profession and encourage alternative care based on [[spiritual healing]]. According to the [[Church of Scientology]], psychiatry has a long history of improper and abusive care. The group's views have been disputed, criticized and condemned by experts in the medical and scientific community and been a source of public controversy.

==Hubbard and psychiatry==

[[L. Ron Hubbard]], Scientology's founder, was critical of [[psychiatry]].<ref name="Crime&P">{{cite paper | author=Hubbard, L. Ron | title=Crime and Psychiatry | year=1969 | url=http://freedom.lronhubbard.org/page080.htm}}</ref><ref name= "Crime&Psych">{{cite web | author=Hubbard, L.

{{cite paper | author=Hubbard, L. Ron | title=Criminals and Psychiatry | year=1980 | url=http://freedom.lronhubbard.org/page104a.htm}}</ref>
Referring to psychiatrists as "psychs", Hubbard regarded psychiatrists as denying human spirituality and peddling fake cures. He was also convinced that psychiatrists were themselves deeply unethical individuals, committing "extortion, mayhem and murder. Our files are full of evidence on them."<ref name="Crime&P"/><ref name="Crime&Psych"/>

Anti-psychiatric themes also appear in some of Hubbard's fictional works.<ref name="Frenschkowski">{{cite journal | last = Frenschkowski | first = Marco | year = 1999 | month = July | title = L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology: An annotated bibliographical survey of primary and selected secondary literature | journal = Marburg Journal of Religion | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | url = http://web.uni-marburg.de/religionswissenschaft/journal/mjr/frenschkowski.html | accessdate = 2006-07-11 }}</ref> In Hubbard's ten-volume series ''[[Mission Earth (novel)|Mission Earth]],'' various characters debate the methods and validity of psychology. In his novel ''[[Battlefield Earth (novel)|Battlefield Earth]]'', the evil Catrists (a pun on psychiatrists), are described as a group of [[charlatan]]s claiming to be mental health experts, who rule the alien Psychlo species (whose name means "brain" or "property of" in the Psychlo language). The vicious and degraded Psychlos of ''Battlefield Earth'' are often speculated to be Hubbard's personal idea of what psychiatry would end up doing to humanity if left unchallenged by Scientology.

A number of psychiatrists have strongly spoken out against the Church of Scientology. After Hubbard's book, ''[[Dianetics: the Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' was published, the [[American Psychological Association]] advised its members against using Hubbard's techniques with their patients. Hubbard came to believe that psychiatrists were behind a worldwide conspiracy to attack Scientology and create a "world government" run by psychiatrists on behalf of the [[USSR]]:

<blockquote>Our enemies are less than twelve men. They are members of the [[Bank of England]] and other higher financial circles. They own and control newspaper chains and they, oddly enough, run all the mental health groups in the world that had sprung up [&hellip;]. Their apparent programme was to use mental health, which is to say psychiatric electric shock and pre-frontal lobotomy, to remove from their path any political dissenters [&hellip;]. These fellows have gotten nearly every government in the world to owe them considerable quantities of money through various chicaneries and they control, of course, income tax, government finance&thinsp;—&thinsp;[[Harold Wilson|{{interpolation|Harold}} Wilson]], for instance, the current Premier of England, is totally involved with these fellows and talks about nothing else actually.<ref>[http://solitarytrees.net.silver.alphamegahosting.com/cowen/misc/psywar.htm] Ron's Journal '67 (RJ67).</ref></blockquote>

Hubbard's efforts to cast the field of psychiatry as the source of all of humanity's problems are exemplified in a policy letter written in 1971, in which he attempted to redefine the word "psychiatrist" to mean "an antisocial enemy of the people":

<blockquote>''Psychiatry'' and ''psychiatrist'' are easily redefined to mean 'an antisocial enemy of the people.' This takes the kill-crazy psychiatrist off the preferred list of professions. This is a good use of the technique {{interpolation|of redefining words}} as for a century the psychiatrist has been setting an all-time record for inhumanity to Man.<ref>[http://carolineletkeman.org/sp/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=228&Itemid=202] L. Ron Hubbard, ''HCOPL (5 October 71) Propaganda by Redefinition of Words''.</ref></blockquote>

==The Church of Scientology and psychiatry==
[[File:Scientology psychiatry kills.jpg|thumb|300px|Scientologists often hold anti-psychiatry demonstrations]]

A 1969 book, ''[[Believe What You Like]]'', described an attempt by Scientologists to secretly infiltrate the [[National Association of Mental Health]] in Britain and turn official policy against mental health treatment. Though they were expelled from the organization after their identity and mission were revealed, the Church of Scientology then filed a number of suits against the NAMH.

When [[Operation Snow White]], a Church of Scientology campaign to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder L. Ron Hubbard, was revealed in 1980, it came to light that Scientology agents of the [[Guardian's Office]] had also conducted a similar campaign against the [[World Federation for Mental Health]] and the [[National Association of Mental Health]].<ref>Beresford, David. "Snow White's dirty tricks", [[The Guardian]], 1980-02-07.</ref>

Scientology's views are expressed by its president in the following quote:

<blockquote>What the Church opposes are brutal, inhumane psychiatric treatments. It does so for three principal reasons: 1) procedures such as [[electroshock therapy|electro-shock]], [[psychoactive drug|drugs]] and [[lobotomy]] injure, maim and destroy people in the guise of help; 2) psychiatry is not a [[science]] and has no proven methods to justify the billions of dollars of government funds that are poured into it; and 3) psychiatric theories that man is a mere animal have been used to rationalize, for example, the wholesale slaughter of human beings in [[World War I|World Wars I]] and [[World War II|II]].<ref>[http://faq.scientology.org/psychtry.htm Why is Scientology opposed to psychiatry? The President of the Church of Scientology Answers Your Questions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></blockquote>

An October 2006 article in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' underlines the strong opposition of Scientology toward the psychiatric profession:

<blockquote>Up front, David Miscavige is dramatically&thinsp;—&thinsp;and somewhat bizarrely&thinsp;—&thinsp;attacking psychiatrists, his words backed by clips from a Scientology-produced DVD are broadcast on four giant high-definition TV screens and sensationally called: ''Psychiatry: an industry of death'' [...]. ‘A woman is safer in a park at midnight than on a psychiatrist's couch’, booms Miscavige, backed by savage graphics of psychiatrists&thinsp;—&thinsp;or ‘psychs’ as he calls them&thinsp;—&thinsp;being machine-gunned out of existence.<ref>{{cite news | last=Cohen | first=David | title=Tom's aliens target City's 'planetary rulers' | journal=Evening Standard | pages=18–19 | date=2006-10-23 }}</ref></blockquote>

[[File:Piod museum warning.jpg|thumb|200px|Warning sign at [[Psychiatry: An Industry of Death]], a Scientology-run museum in [[Los Angeles]]]]

The group says that they are near victory in their war against psychiatry. In their treatise ''Those Who Oppose Scientology'', it is stated:

<blockquote>Today, there are 500 Dianeticists and Scientologists to every psychiatrist [&hellip;] while Scientology is more visible than ever, with churches dotting every continent on Earth and millions of parishioners around the world, one is hard pressed to find even a single psychiatrist with a shingle on his door.<ref>[http://opposing.scientology.org/31-end.htm] Scientology page on why the world’s governments oppose the church.</ref></blockquote>

Scientology claims a worldwide membership of more than 8 million, the total of people who have taken the Scientology introductory course.<ref name = "Flinn-WashingtonPost">{{cite web | first = Frank K. | last = Flinn | title = Scientology | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/06/30/DI2005063001394.html | work = Live discussion | publisher = [[Washington Post]] | date = 2005-07-05 | accessdate = 2008-02-04 }}</ref> The Church of Scientology claims 3.5 million members in the United States,<ref>[http://www.rickross.com/reference/scientology/history/history120.html Kansas City Star March 17, 2007; article reprinted at rickross.com]</ref> though an independent survey has found the number of people in the [[United States]] would state their religion as 'Scientology' is close to 55,000.<ref>Kosmin, Barry A. et al.

[[Mental health professional|Mental health care professionals]] are not concerned that the public will take CCHR materials seriously, because of the organization's connection with the church; however, they argue that these materials can have a harmful impact when quoted without attribution.<ref name="Barlas">{{Cite journal | last=Barlas | first=Stephen | title=Psychiatric Profession Current Target of Citizens Commission on Human Rights | journal=Psychiatric Times | year=1996 | url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/p961110.html}}</ref>

Except for court trials and media publications and public rallies, published materials have received little notice outside of Scientology and CCHR; of reviews available, few are positive. Psychology professor [[Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi]]'s short review of ''Psychiatrists: The Men Behind Hitler'' states:

<blockquote>Scientology has attracted much attention through its propaganda effort against what it calls psychiatry. This has involved great expense and organizational effort, carried out through a variety of fronts. If the book ''Psychiatrists: The Men Behind Hitler'' (Roder, Kubillus, & Burwell, 1995) is a representative example, and I believe it is, it proves decisively that the campaign is rooted in total [[paranoia]] and pathetic ignorance. Reading this book, and I will urge you not to waste too much time doing it, makes clear that the authors simply have no idea what psychiatry is.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Beit-Hallahmi | first=Benjamin | authorlink=Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi | title=Scientology: Religion or racket? | journal=Marburg Journal of Religion | year=2003 | url=http://www.uni-marburg.de/religionswissenschaft/journal/mjr/beit.html}}</ref></blockquote>

The American Psychiatric Association's Lynn Schultz-Writsel adds:

<blockquote>We have not responded in any way, shape or form. There has not been a hue and cry from members to respond. And anyway, the publication speaks for itself.<ref name="Barlas" /></blockquote>

Michael Burke, the president of the Kansas Psychiatric Association, said regarding Scientology, "They aren't really able to support their position with any scientific data, which they tend to ignore. &hellip; the public seems to be able to look right past the Scientology hoopla."<ref name=KC>{{Cite news

The commercial motivation of Scientology in questioning psychiatry, with their alternative practice, [[dianetics]], has been questioned by [[Peter W. Huber]].<ref>http://www.overlawyered.com/articles/huber/junksci.html</ref>

Scientology helped to expose [[Harry Bailey]], a controversial Australian psychiatrist. Bailey bore the primary responsibility for treatment of mental patients via Deep sleep therapy, and other methods, at a [[Sydney]] mental hospital in the 1970s. He has been linked with the deaths of a total of 85 patients, and committed suicide before he could be punished.<ref>[http://books.google.fr/books?id=efnJv5VDUYAC&pg=PT144&dq=%22charles+hewitt%27+%22bodkin+adams%22&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q=%22charles%20hewitt%27%20%22bodkin%20adams%22&f=false ''Medical Murder'', Robert M. Kaplan]</ref>

===Legal waivers===
Following legal actions involving the Church of Scientology's relationship with its members, it has become standard practice within the group for members to sign lengthy legal contracts and waivers before engaging in Scientology services. In 2003, a series of media reports examined the legal contracts required by Scientology, which require that, among other things, Scientology followers deny any and all psychiatric care that their doctors may prescribe to them:

<blockquote>I do not believe in or subscribe to psychiatric labels for individuals. It is my strongly held religious belief that all mental problems are spiritual in nature and that there is no such thing as a mentally incompetent person&thinsp;—&thinsp;only those suffering from spiritual upset of one kind or another dramatized by an individual. I reject all psychiatric labels and intend for this Contract to clearly memorialize my desire to be helped exclusively through religious, spiritual means and not through any form of psychiatric treatment, specifically including involuntary commitment based on so-called lack of competence. Under no circumstances, at any time, do I wish to be denied my right to care from members of my religion to the exclusion of psychiatric care or psychiatric directed care, regardless of what any psychiatrist, medical person, designated member of the state or family member may assert supposedly on my behalf.<ref>{{cite web | title=Scientology release form for the [[Introspection Rundown]] | url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~jeta/scn/scans/Introspection-Release.html | accessdate=August 14, 2005 }}</ref></blockquote>

===Citizens Commission on Human Rights===
{{Main|Citizens Commission on Human Rights}}
The Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), an institution set up by Scientology and [[Thomas Szasz]], also claims that the real nature of psychiatry is that of [[human rights abuse]].

In 1966 Hubbard declared all-out war on psychiatry, telling Scientologists that "We want at least one bad mark on every psychiatrist in England, a murder, an assault, or a rape or more than one." He committed the Church of Scientology to the goal of eradicating psychiatry in 1969, announcing that "Our war has been forced to become 'To take over absolutely the field of mental healing on this planet in all forms.'"<ref>{{cite news | first =Richard | last =Leiby | author =Richard Leiby |  url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/24/AR2005062401866.html | title =A Couch Tom Cruise Won't Jump On | work =[[The Washington Post]] | publisher = The Washington Post Company | page = C01 | date = 2005-06-25 | accessdate = 2006-08-17 }}</ref>

Not coincidentally, the Church of Scientology founded the Citizens Commission on Human Rights that same year as its primary vehicle for attacking psychiatry. CCHR still quotes Hubbard's above-cited statement that ''all'' psychiatrists are criminals: "There is not one institutional psychiatrist alive who, by ordinary [[criminal law]], could not be arraigned and convicted of [[extortion]], [[Mayhem (crime)|mayhem]] and [[murder]]. Our files are full of evidence on them."<ref name="Crime&P"/><ref name= "Crime&Psych"/>

CCHR has conducted campaigns against [[Prozac]], against [[electroconvulsive therapy]], against [[Ritalin]] (and the existence of [[ADHD]]) and against various health legislations. CCHR has also opened a permanent museum, "[[Psychiatry: An Industry of Death]]", in [[Hollywood, California]].

==Space Opera==
{{Main|Space opera in Scientology doctrine}}
The Church of Scientology teaches a "[[Space opera in Scientology doctrine|Space Opera]]" history of the universe to Scientologists graded at the level of [[Operating Thetan]] and above. Events are told of which allegedly happened billions and even trillions of years ago (contradicting science's estimated [[age of the universe]]), in which psychiatry was a tool of oppression used by evil alien civilizations.

Hubbard decided that psychiatrists were an ancient evil that had been a problem for billions of years. He cast them in the role of assisting [[Xenu]]'s genocide 75 million years ago. In a bulletin entitled ''Pain and Sex'', Hubbard declares that "pain and sex were the <small>INVENTED TOOLS</small> of degradation", having been devised eons ago by psychiatrists "who have been on the [time] track a long time and are the sole cause of decline in this universe".<ref>{{cite paper | author=Hubbard, L. Ron | title=Pain and Sex | date=August 26, 1982}}</ref> In a lecture called ''Aberration and the Fifth Dynamic'' Hubbard stated:

<blockquote>take a sheet of glass and put it in front of the preclear&thinsp;—&thinsp;clear, very clear glass&thinsp;—&thinsp;which is supercooled, preferably about a −100 centigrade. You got that? Supercooled, you know? And then put the preclear right in front of this supercooled sheet of glass and suddenly shove his face into the glass. Now, that's pretty good. I mean, that was developed about five billion years ago by a whole-track psychiatrist [&hellip;]. The mechanism of brainwashing which I gave you, with supercold mechanisms and so forth, is very well known, was used very extensively in the Maw Confederation of the Sixty-third Galaxy. They had a total psychiatric control of all of their officers and executives, and when they got tired of them they used this specific method of brainwashing"<ref>[http://psychassualt.org] - Hubbard, ''Aberration and The Sixth Dynamic'' transcript, catalog #5611C13 15ACC-22.</ref></blockquote>

==Anti-psychiatry: A parallel movement==
{{Main|Anti-psychiatry}}

The [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights]] was co-founded by anti-psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]] and the Church of Scientology in 1969.<ref name="ShorterHealy2007">{{cite book|author1=Edward Shorter|author2=David Healy|author3=David Healy (MRC Psych.)|title=Shock therapy: a history of electroconvulsive treatment in mental illness|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RvXzXnskJB4C&pg=PA184|accessdate=9 October 2011|year=2007|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-4169-3|page=184}}</ref> Some anti-psychiatry websites and [[Psychiatric survivors movement|psychiatric survivors]] groups have sought to distance themselves from Scientology and the CCHR. Lawyer Douglas A. Smith stated in his anti-psychiatry web page:

<blockquote>'''No Scientologists, please''': Volunteers will be asked for assurance they are <u>not</u> affiliated with the ‘Church’ of Scientology or its Citizen's Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), which have publicized the harm done by psychiatry but which we want no affiliation with.<ref>[http://www.antipsychiatry.org The Antipsychiatry Coalition<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></blockquote>

This clarification is not to criticize any organization, but to just state the facts.<ref>[http://www.mindfreedom.org/mfi-faq/MFI-atkin.pdf/view?searchterm=cchr Attorney letter about MFI independence]</ref></blockquote>

Despite sharing notable anti-psychiatry views on some issues with the secular critics, Scientology doctrine does differ in some respects. Scientology has promoted psychiatry-related conspiracy theories, including that psychiatrists were behind the [[Yugoslav wars]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Bosnia & Kosovo: On The Trail Of Psychiatric Genocide | work=Psychiatry a Human Rights Abuse and Global Failure | url=http://www.cchr.org/failure/eng/page42.htm  | accessdate=April 9, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041024012334/http://www.cchr.org/failure/eng/page42.htm |archivedate = October 24, 2004}}</ref> and that [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11]] was caused by psychiatrists.<ref>Hubbard Communications Office Bulletin 26 August 1982, "Pain and Sex".

"{{interp|The psychs}} are the sole cause of decline in this universe ..."</ref>  Scientologists are religiously committed never to take psychiatric drugs and to reject [[psychology]] outright.

The socio-political roots of the movements have different origins. Advocates of the anti-psychiatric world view such as [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]], [[R. D. Laing]] and [[Michel Foucault]] had ties with the [[political left]] of the 1960s; [[Thomas Szasz]], with the [[civil libertarian]]s of the right, as well as an outspoken [[atheist]]. Many advocates of the anti-psychiatry movement have stated that they consider the idea of "mental illness" as a convenient and inaccurate label assigned by society rather than an objective biomedical state, rejecting psychiatric terms such as schizophrenia which they may see as stigmatizing. By contrast, Hubbard referred to "schizophrenics" in his writings on Scientology theory,<ref>{{cite book
