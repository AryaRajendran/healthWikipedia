{{Distinguish2|[[Wilson's disease]], a medically recognized condition caused by a defect in copper metabolism}}
'''Wilson’s (temperature) syndrome''', also called '''Wilson’s thyroid syndrome''' or WTS, is an [[alternative medicine]] concept which is not recognized as a medical condition by [[medicine|mainstream medicine]].<ref name="mayo">{{cite web | publisher = [[Mayo Clinic]] | first = Todd | last = Nippoldt | title = Is Wilson's syndrome a legitimate ailment? | date = November 21, 2009 | accessdate = April 9, 2010 | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/wilsons-syndrome/AN01728}}</ref> Its supporters describe Wilson's syndrome as a mix of various common and [[non-specific symptoms]] which they attribute to low body temperature and impaired conversion of [[thyroxine]] (T4) to [[triiodothyronine]] (T3), despite normal [[thyroid function test]]s. E. Denis Wilson, a physician who named the syndrome after himself, advocates treating these symptoms with sustained-release [[triiodothyronine]].

The [[American Thyroid Association]] (ATA) describes Wilson's syndrome as at odds with established knowledge of thyroid function. The ATA described the diagnostic criteria for Wilson's syndrome as imprecise and non-specific, and found a lack of any [[scientific evidence]] supporting Wilson's claims. The ATA further raised concern that the proposed treatments were potentially harmful.<ref name="ATA"/>  Florida State Medical Board members described Wilson's syndrome as a "phony syndrome" and a scam during disciplinary action against Wilson,<ref name="board">{{cite news | first = Carol | last = Gentry | work = [[St. Petersburg Times]] | title = Doctor's syndrome a sham, board says | url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/54192748.html?dids=54192748:54192748&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Feb+08%2C+1992&author=CAROL+GENTRY&pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&desc=Doctor%27s+syndrome+a+sham%2C+board+says&pqatl=google | date = February 8, 1992 | accessdate = April 9, 2010}}</ref><ref name=lakeland/> while [[Quackwatch]] has called it a "bogus diagnosis".<ref name="quackwatch">{{cite web | publisher = [[Quackwatch]] | first = Stephen | last = Barrett | authorlink = Stephen Barrett | title = Wilson's syndrome | accessdate = April 9, 2010 | url = http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/fad.html#wilson}}</ref>

==Origins and claims==
The term "Wilson’s syndrome" was coined in 1990 by E. Denis Wilson, a physician practicing in [[Longwood, Florida]]. Wilson said that the syndrome's manifestations included fatigue, [[headache]]s, [[PMS]], [[hair loss]], [[irritability]], fluid retention, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], decreased memory, low [[libido|sex drive]], unhealthy [[nail (anatomy)|nail]]s, easy weight gain, and about 60 other symptoms.  Wilson wrote that the syndrome can manifest itself as "virtually every symptom known to man."  He also says that it is "the most common of all chronic ailments and probably takes a greater toll on society than any other medical condition."<ref name = "Wilson Book">{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=E. Denis |title=Wilson's Temperature Syndrome - A Reversible Low Temperature Problem |year=1992 |publisher=Cornerstone Publishing |isbn=0-9708510-1-4}}</ref>

Wilson says that low thyroid symptoms and low temperatures in the presence of normal [[thyroid function test]]s are not due to [[hypothyroidism]], and might be reversed with a few months of treatment.  To distinguish this condition from hypothyroidism, he named it Wilson's (temperature) syndrome.  He states that it is "especially brought on by stress" and can persist after the stress has passed. He says that the main diagnostic sign is a [[body temperature]] that averages below {{convert|98.6|°F|°C}} (oral), and that the diagnosis is confirmed if the patient responds to treatment with a "special thyroid hormone treatment".  He says that certain herbs can also help support normal body temperatures.

==Patient death and medical license suspension==
In 1988 a 50-year-old woman died of an [[arrhythmia]] and [[heart attack]] while taking excessive amounts of thyroid hormone prescribed by Wilson; around that time she confessed to not taking the medicine as regularly as prescribed.<ref name="DPR"/> 

Four years later, in 1992, the Florida Board of Medicine took disciplinary action against Wilson,<ref name="FSMB">{{cite web|publisher = Florida Department of Health | title = License Verification: E. Denis Wilson | accessdate = April 2, 2009 | url = http://ww2.doh.state.fl.us/irm00PRAES/PRASINDI.asp?LicId=40535&ProfNBR=1501}}</ref> accusing him of "fleecing" patients with a "phony diagnosis".<ref name="board"/> The Board of Medicine and Wilson settled the disciplinary action, agreeing to a 6-month suspension of Wilson's medical license, after which Wilson would need to attend 100 hours of [[continuing medical education]], submit to psychological testing, and pay a $10,000 fine before resuming practice. Wilson also agreed not to prescribe thyroid medication to anyone unless the Board of Medicine determined that the medical community had accepted "Wilson's Syndrome" and Wilson’s methods and modalities of treatment.<ref name="DPR">State of Florida, Department of Health.

==Evaluations==
During disciplinary action against Wilson, members of the Florida Board of Medicine stated that there was no evidence [Wilson's] syndrome existed. They described Wilson's treatments as dangerous and a scam, stating that Wilson was fleecing insurance companies and patients with treatments for "a phony syndrome".<ref name="board"/><ref name=lakeland>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=gZcsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JvwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2485,5288440&dq=e-denis-wilson&hl=en |title=Board:Physician is fleecing patients|newspaper=Lakeland Ledger|date= February 9, 1992|accessdate=2010-05-27 }}</ref><ref name="board"/><ref name=lakeland/>

The American Thyroid Association (ATA), a [[professional association]] dedicated to promoting thyroid health, disavows Wilson's Syndrome. The ATA stated in 2005 that a "thorough review of the biomedical literature has found no scientific evidence supporting the existence of 'Wilson's Syndrome'." The statement added that the mean temperature of normal persons in the AM on waking is 97.5 °F, not 98.5 °F, and that many of the symptoms described by Wilson are nonspecific and typical of depression, anxiety, and psychological and social stress. It also notes that a similar set of symptoms occurs in the alternative diagnoses of [[neurasthenia]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[fibromyalgia]], [[multiple chemical sensitivity]], chronic Epstein-Barr virus syndrome, and chronic candidiasis. Finally, the Association notes that chronic supplementation with [[triiodothyronine]] (T3) is particularly difficult and problematic, since various tissues set their own cellular levels of this hormone by making it individually from [[thyroxine]], and supplementation of T3 may overwhelm this normal regulatory mechanism in some of these tissues.<ref name="ATA">{{cite web |title=Public Health Statement: "Wilson’s Syndrome"|url= http://www.thyroid.org/professionals/publications/statements/99_11_16_wilsons.html |publisher=American Thyroid Association}}</ref>

The [[Mayo Clinic]] website similarly warns that Wilson's syndrome is not an accepted medical diagnosis, and advises  patients against the unproven therapies associated with the "syndrome".<ref name="mayo"/>
