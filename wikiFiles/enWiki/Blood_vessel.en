The '''blood vessels''' are the part of the [[circulatory system]] that transports [[blood]] throughout the [[body]]. There are three major types of blood vessels: the [[artery|arteries]], which carry the blood away from the [[heart]]; the [[capillary|capillaries]], which enable the actual exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]; and the [[vein]]s, which carry blood from the capillaries back toward the heart.

== Anatomy ==

The arteries and veins have three layers, but the middle layer is thicker in the arteries than it is in the veins:
* ''[[Tunica intima]]'' (the thinnest layer): a single layer of simple squamous [[endothelium|endothelial cells]] glued by a [[polysaccharide]] intercellular matrix, surrounded by a thin layer of subendothelial [[connective tissue]] interlaced with a number of circularly arranged elastic bands called the ''[[internal elastic lamina]]''.
* ''[[Tunica media]]'' (the thickest layer in arteries): circularly arranged elastic fiber, connective tissue, polysaccharide substances, the second and third layer are separated by another thick elastic band called external elastic lamina. The tunica media may (especially in arteries) be rich in [[vascular smooth muscle]], which controls the caliber of the vessel.
* ''[[Tunica adventitia]]'': (the thickest layer in veins) entirely made of connective tissue. It also contains [[nerve]]s that supply the vessel as well as nutrient capillaries ([[vasa vasorum]]) in the larger blood vessels.

[[Capillary|Capillaries]] consist of little more than a layer of endothelium and occasional connective tissue.

When blood vessels connect to form a region of diffuse vascular supply it is called an [[circulatory anastomosis|anastomosis]] (pl. anastomoses). Anastomoses provide critical alternative routes for blood to flow in case of blockages.
 
There is a layer of muscle surronding the arteries which help contract and expand the vessels. This creates enough pressure for blood to be pumped around the body.

There are various kinds of blood vessels:
* [[Artery|Arteries]]
** [[Aorta]] (the largest artery, carries blood out of the heart)
** Branches of the aorta, such as the [[carotid artery]], the [[subclavian artery]], the [[celiac trunk]], the [[mesenteric artery|mesenteric arteries]], the [[renal artery]] and the [[iliac artery]].
* [[Arteriole]]s
* [[Capillary|Capillaries]] (the smallest blood vessels)
* [[Venule]]s
* [[Vein]]s
** Large collecting vessels, such as the [[subclavian vein]], the [[jugular vein]], the [[renal vein]] and the [[iliac vein]].
** [[Venae cavae]] (the 2 largest veins, carry blood into the heart)

They are roughly grouped as ''arterial'' and ''venous'', determined by whether the blood in it is flowing  ''away from'' (arterial) or ''toward'' (venous) the [[heart]]. The term "arterial blood" is nevertheless used to indicate blood high in [[oxygen]], although the [[pulmonary artery]] carries "venous blood" and blood flowing in the [[pulmonary vein]] is rich in oxygen.  This is because they are carrying the blood to and from the lungs, respectively, to be oxygenated.

== Physiology ==

Blood vessels do not actively engage in the transport of blood (they have no appreciable [[peristalsis]]), but arteries—and veins to a degree—can regulate their inner diameter by contraction of the muscular layer. This changes the blood flow to downstream organs, and is determined by the [[autonomic nervous system]]. Vasodilation and vasoconstriction are also used antagonistically as methods of [[thermoregulation]].'''

[[Oxygen]] (bound to [[hemoglobin]] in [[red blood cell]]s) is the most critical nutrient carried by the blood. In all arteries apart from the pulmonary artery, hemoglobin is highly saturated (95-100%) with oxygen. In all veins apart from the [[pulmonary vein]], the [[hemoglobin]] is desaturated at about 75%. (The values are reversed in the [[pulmonary]] circulation.)

The blood pressure in blood vessels is traditionally expressed in [[torr|millimetres of mercury]] (1 mmHg = 133 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]). In the arterial system, this is usually around 120 mmHg [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] (high pressure wave due to contraction of the heart) and 80 mmHg [[diastolic]] (low pressure wave). In contrast, pressures in the venous system are constant and rarely exceed 10 mmHg.

[[Vasoconstriction]] is the constriction of blood vessels (narrowing, becoming smaller in cross-sectional area) by contracting the [[vascular smooth muscle]] in the vessel walls. It is regulated by [[vasoconstrictor]]s (agents that cause vasoconstriction). These include [[paracrine]] factors (e.g. [[prostaglandin]]s), a number of [[hormone]]s (e.g. [[Antidiuretic hormone|vasopressin]] and [[angiotensin]]) and [[neurotransmitter]]s (e.g. [[epinephrine]]) from the nervous system.

[[Vasodilation]] is a similar process mediated by antagonistically acting mediators. The most prominent vasodilator is [[nitric oxide]] (termed [[endothelium-derived relaxing factor]] for this reason).

Permeability of the [[endothelium]] is pivotal in the release of nutrients to the tissue. It is also increased in [[inflammation]] in response to [[histamine]], [[prostaglandin]]s and [[interleukin]]s, which leads to most of the symptoms of inflammation (swelling, redness, warmth and pain).

== Role in disease ==
{{main|Vascular disease}}

Blood vessels play a huge role in virtually every medical condition. [[Cancer]], for example, cannot progress unless the tumor causes [[angiogenesis]] (formation of new blood vessels) to supply the malignant cells' metabolic demand. [[Atherosclerosis]], the formation of [[lipid]] lumps ([[atheroma]]s) in the blood vessel wall, is the most common [[cardiovascular disease]], the main cause of death in the Western world.

Blood vessel permeability is increased in [[inflammation]]. Damage, due to [[Physical trauma|trauma]] or spontaneously, may lead to [[hemorrhage]] due to mechanical damage to the vessel [[endothelium]]. In contrast, occlusion of the blood vessel by atherosclerotic plaque, by an [[embolism|embolised]] [[blood clot]] or a foreign body leads to downstream [[ischemia]] (insufficient blood supply) and possibly [[necrosis]].  Vessel occlusion tends to be a positive feedback system; an occluded vessel creates eddies in the normally [[laminar flow]] or [[plug flow]] blood currents.  These eddies create abnormal fluid velocity gradients which push blood elements such as cholesterol or [[chylomicron]] bodies to the endothelium.  These deposit onto the arterial walls which are already partially occluded and build upon the blockage.<ref>Multiphase Flow and Fluidization, Gidaspow et al., Academic Press, 1992</ref>

[[Vasculitis]] is [[inflammation]] of the vessel wall, due to [[autoimmune disease]] or [[infection]].
