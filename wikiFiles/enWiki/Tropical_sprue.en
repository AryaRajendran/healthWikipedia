'''Tropical sprue''' is a [[malabsorption]] disease commonly found in the tropical regions, marked with abnormal flattening of the [[Intestinal villus|villi]] and [[inflammation]] of the lining of the [[small intestine]].
It differs significantly from [[coeliac sprue]].

==Symptoms and signs==
The illness usually starts with an attack of acute diarrhea, fever and malaise following which, after a variable period, the patient settles into the chronic phase of diarrhoea, steatorrhoea, weight loss, [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[malaise]] and nutritional deficiencies. 
The symptoms of tropical sprue are:
* [[Diarrhea]]
* [[Steatorrhea]] or fatty stool (often foul-smelling and whitish in colour)
* [[Indigestion]]
* [[Cramps]]
* [[Weight loss]] and [[malnutrition]]
* [[Fatigue (physical)|Fatigue]]

Left untreated, nutrient and [[vitamin deficiency|vitamin deficiencies]] may develop in patients with tropical sprue.  These deficiencies may have the following symptoms:
* [[Vitamin A]] deficiency: [[hyperkeratosis]] or skin scales
* [[Vitamin B12|Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] and [[folic acid]] deficiencies: [[anaemia]]
* [[Vitamin D]] and [[calcium]] deficiencies: [[spasm]], [[bone pain]], [[numbness]] and [[tingling sensation]]
* [[Vitamin K]] deficiency: [[bruises]]

Tropical sprue was responsible for one-sixth of all casualties sustained by the Allied forces in India and Southeast Asia during World War II.<ref>[http://www.uab.edu/nutrition/about/history?start=1 UAB Department of Nutrition Sciences - History]</ref>

==Investigations==
Diagnosis of tropical sprue can be complicated because many diseases have similar symptoms.  The following investigation results are suggestive:

* Abnormal flattening of [[villi]] and inflammation of the lining of the small intestine, observed during an [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] procedure.
* Presence of inflammatory cells (most often lymphocytes) in the [[biopsy]] of small intestine tissue.
* Low levels of vitamins [[vitamin A|A]], [[vitamin B12|B<sub>12</sub>]], [[vitamin E|E]], [[vitamin D|D]], and [[vitamin K|K]], as well as [[serum albumin]], [[calcium]], and [[folate]], revealed by a blood test.
* Excess fat in the [[feces]] ([[steatorrhoea]]).
* Thickened small bowel folds seen on [[barium swallow]]

Tropical sprue is largely limited to within about 30 degrees north and south of the [[equator]]. Therefore, if one resides outside of that geographical region, recent travel to the region is a key factor in diagnosing this disease.

==Cause==
The cause of tropical sprue is not known.<ref name="pmid9135537">{{cite journal |author=Cook GC |title= Tropical sprue: some early investigators favoured an infective cause, but was a coccidian protozoan involved? |journal=Gut |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=428–9 |year=1997 |month=March |pmid=9135537 |pmc=1027098 |doi= |url=http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9135537}}</ref>  It has been suggested that it is caused by bacterial, viral, amoebal, or [[parasitic infection]].  [[Folic acid deficiency]] and [[rancid fat]] have also been suggested as possible causes.
In a condition called [[coeliac disease]] (also known as ''[[coeliac sprue]]''), which has similar symptoms to tropical sprue, the flattening of the [[Intestinal villus|villi]] and [[small intestine inflammation]] is caused by an [[autoimmune disorder]].

==Affected regions==
The disease was first described by [[William Hillary]]<ref name="pmid2691344">{{cite journal | author = Bartholomew C | title = William Hillary and sprue in the Caribbean: 230 years later | journal = Gut | volume = 30 | issue = Special issue | pages = 17–21 | year = 1989 | month = November | pmid = 2691344 | pmc = 1440696 | doi = | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1440696/pdf/gut00226-0023.pdf }}</ref> in 1759 in [[Barbados]]. Tropical sprue is endemic to [[India]] and southeast [[Asia]], Central and [[South America]], and the [[Caribbean]].

==Treatment==
Once diagnosed, tropical sprue can be treated by a course of the antibiotic [[tetracycline]](Doxycycline) or [[Sulfamethoxazole]]/Trimethoprim(Co-trimoxazole) for 3 to 6 months, as well as supplementation of vitamins B<sub>12</sub> and folic acid.

The use of folic acid in the treatment of tropical sprue was promoted in the late 1940s by Dr. [[Tom Spies]] of the [[University of Alabama]], while conducting his research in Cuba and Puerto Rico.<ref>[http://www.uab.edu/nutrition/about/history UAB Department of Nutrition Sciences - History]</ref><ref>[http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=320916 JAMA: DR. SPIES RECEIVES DISTINGUISHED SERVICE MEDAL (1957)]</ref>

==Prevention==
Preventive measures include using only [[bottled water]] for drinking, brushing teeth, and washing food, and avoiding fruits washed with tap water (or consuming only peeled fruits, such as [[bananas]] and [[orange (fruit)|oranges]]).

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for tropical sprue is excellent.  It usually does not recur in patients who get it during travel to affected regions.  The recurrence rate for natives is about 20%.
