'''Methemoglobinemia''' (or '''methaemoglobinaemia''') is a disorder characterized by the presence of a higher than normal level of [[methemoglobin]] (metHb, i.e., ferric [Fe<sup>3+</sup>] rather than ferrous [Fe<sup>2+</sup>] haemoglobin) in the [[blood]]. Methemoglobin is a form of [[hemoglobin]] that contains ferric [Fe<sup>3+</sup>] iron and has a decreased ability to bind oxygen. However, the ferric iron has an increased affinity for bound oxygen.<ref>{{cite web|title=Methemoglobinemia|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/204178-overview|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref>   The binding of oxygen to methemoglobin results in an increased affinity of oxygen to the three other heme sites (that are still ferrous) within the same tetrameric hemoglobin unit.  This leads to an overall reduced ability of the red blood cell to release oxygen to tissues, with the associated [[oxygen–haemoglobin dissociation curve|oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve]] therefore shifted to the left. When methemoglobin concentration is elevated in [[red blood cells]], [[tissue hypoxia]] can occur.

==Pathophysiology==
Normally, methemoglobin levels are <1%, as measured by the co-oximetry test. Elevated levels of methemoglobin in the blood are caused when the mechanisms that defend against [[oxidative stress]] within the red blood cell are overwhelmed and the oxygen carrying [[ferrous|ferrous ion (Fe<sup>2+</sup>)]] of the [[heme]] group of the hemoglobin molecule is oxidized to the [[ferric|ferric state (Fe<sup>3+</sup>)]]. This converts hemoglobin to methemoglobin, resulting in a reduced ability to release oxygen to tissues and thereby hypoxia. This can give the blood a bluish or chocolate-brown color. Spontaneously formed methemoglobin is normally reduced (regenerating normal hemoglobin) by protective enzyme systems, e.g., NADH methemoglobin reductase ([[cytochrome-b5 reductase]]) (major pathway), NADPH methemoglobin reductase (minor pathway) and to a lesser extent the ascorbic acid and glutathione enzyme systems. Disruptions with these enzyme systems lead to the condition.

Hypoxia occurs due to the decreased oxygen-binding capacity of methemoglobin, as well as the increased oxygen-binding affinity of other subunits in the same hemoglobin molecule which prevents them from releasing oxygen at normal tissue oxygen levels.

==Types==
===Congenital methemoglobinemia===
[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|The congenital form of methemoglobinemia has an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern of inheritance.]]
Due to a deficiency of the [[enzyme]] diaphorase I (NADH methemoglobin reductase), methemoglobin levels rise and the blood of met-Hb patients has reduced oxygen-carrying capacity. Instead of being red in color, the arterial blood of met-Hb patients is brown. This results in the skin of [[White people|Caucasian]] patients gaining a bluish hue. Hereditary met-Hb is caused by a [[recessive gene]]. If only one parent has this gene, offspring will have normal-hued skin, but if both parents carry the gene there is a chance the offspring will have blue-hued skin.

Another cause of congenital methemoglobinemia is seen in patients with abnormal hemoglobin variants such as hemoglobin M (HbM), or [[Hemoglobin h|hemoglobin H (HbH)]], which are not amenable to [[redox|reduction]] despite intact enzyme systems.

Methemoglobinemia can also arise in patients with [[pyruvate kinase deficiency]] due to impaired production of [[NADH]] – the essential cofactor for diaphorase I. Similarly, patients with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency|Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency]] may have impaired production of another co-factor, [[NADPH]].

===Acquired methemoglobinemia===
Methemoglobinemia can also be acquired.<ref name="pmid15342970">{{cite journal |author=Ash-Bernal R, Wise R, Wright SM |title=Acquired methemoglobinemia: a retrospective series of 138 cases at 2 teaching hospitals |journal=Medicine (Baltimore) |volume=83 |issue=5 |pages=265–273 |year=2004 |pmid=15342970 |doi= |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0025-7974&volume=83&issue=5&spage=265}}</ref> The protective enzyme systems normally present in red blood cells maintain methemoglobin levels at less than one percent of the total hemoglobin in healthy people. Exposure to exogenous oxidizing drugs and their metabolites (such as [[benzocaine]], [[dapsone]] and [[nitrate]]s) may accelerate the rate of formation of methemoglobin up to one-thousandfold, overwhelming the protective enzyme systems and acutely increasing methemoglobin levels.

Classical drug causes of methemoglobinaemia include [[antibiotic]]s ([[trimethoprim]], [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]] and [[dapsone]]<ref name="pmid18090884">{{cite journal |author=Zosel A, Rychter K, Leikin JB |title=Dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia: case report and literature review |journal=Am J Ther |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=585–587 |year=2007 |pmid=18090884 |doi=10.1097/MJT.0b013e3180a6af55 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?an=00045391-200711000-00012}}</ref>), [[local anesthetic]]s (especially [[articaine]] and [[prilocaine]]<ref name="pmid18037845">{{cite journal |author=Adams V, Marley J, McCarroll C |title=Prilocaine induced methaemoglobinaemia in a medically compromised patient. Was this an inevitable consequence of the dose administered? |journal=Br Dent J |volume=203 |issue=10 |pages=585–587 |year=2007 |pmid=18037845 |doi=10.1038/bdj.2007.1045}}</ref>), and others such as [[aniline]] dyes, [[metoclopramide]], [[chlorate]]s and [[bromate]]s. Ingestion of compounds containing [[nitrates]] (such as the patina chemical [[bismuth nitrate]]) can also cause methemoglobinemia.

Infants under 6 months of age are particularly susceptible to methemoglobinemia caused by nitrates ingested in drinking water [http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/basicinformation/nitrate.cfm] (called [[blue-baby syndrome]]), dehydration usually caused by gastroenteritis with diarrhea, sepsis, and topical anesthetics containing benzocaine or prilocaine. Nitrates used in agricultural fertilizers may leak into the ground and may contaminate well water. The current EPA standard of 10 ppm nitrate-nitrogen for drinking water is specifically designed to protect infants [http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/basicinformation/nitrate.cfm] [[Benzocaine]] applied to the gums or throat (as commonly used in baby [[teething]] gels) can cause methemoglobinemia.[http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm250024.htm]

==Treatment==
Methemoglobinemia can be treated with supplemental oxygen and [[methylene blue]]<ref name="pmid17572332">{{cite journal |author=Yusim Y, Livingstone D, Sidi A |title=Blue dyes, blue people: the systemic effects of blue dyes when administered via different routes |journal=J Clin Anesth |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=315–321 |year=2007 |pmid=17572332 |doi=10.1016/j.jclinane.2007.01.006 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0952-8180(07)00085-2}}</ref> 1% solution (10&nbsp;mg/ml) 1 to 2&nbsp;mg/kg administered intravenously slowly over five minutes followed by IV flush with normal saline. Methylene blue restores the iron in hemoglobin to its normal ([[redox|reduced]]) oxygen-carrying state.

This is achieved by providing an artificial electron acceptor (such as methylene blue, or flavin) for NADPH [[methemoglobin reductase]] (RBCs usually don't have one; the presence of methylene blue allows the enzyme to function at 5x normal levels<ref>Yubisui T; Takeshita M; Yoneyama Y. Reduction of methemoglobin through flavin at the physiological concentration by NADPH-flavin reductase of human erythrocytes. J Biochem (Tokyo) 1980 Jun;87(6):1715-20. PMID 7400118</ref>)  The NADPH is generated via the [[hexose monophosphate shunt]].

Diaphorase II normally contributes only a small percentage of the red blood cells reducing capacity but is pharmacologically activated by exogenous cofactors, such as methylene blue, to 5 times its normal level of activity. Genetically induced chronic low-level methemoglobinemia may be treated with oral methylene blue daily. Also, vitamin C can occasionally reduce cyanosis associated with chronic methemoglobinemia but has no role in treatment of acute acquired methemoglobinemia.

==Symptoms==
Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia (methemoglobin >1%) include shortness of breath, [[cyanosis]] is the classic symptom, mental status changes (~50%), headache, fatigue, exercise intolerance, dizziness and loss of consciousness. Arterial blood with elevated methemoglobin levels has a characteristic chocolate-brown color as compared to normal bright red oxygen-containing arterial blood.<ref name=emedmed1466>{{cite web|title = eMedicine - Methemoglobinemia| url = http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic1466.htm|accessdate = 2008-09-13}}</ref>

Severe methemoglobinemia (methemoglobin >50%) patients have dysrhythmias, seizures, coma and death (>70%).<ref name=emedmed1466/> Healthy people may not have many symptoms with methemoglobin levels < 15%, however patients with co-morbidities such as anemia, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, sepsis, or presence of other abnormal hemoglobin species (e.g. carboxyhemoglobin, sulfehemoglobin or sickle hemoglobin) may experience moderate to severe symptoms at much lower levels (as low as 5-8%).

==Carriers==
The Fugates, a family that lived in the hills of Kentucky, are the most famous example of this hereditary genetic condition.  They are known as the "Blue Fugates." Martin Fugate settled near [[Hazard, Kentucky]], circa 1800.  His wife was a carrier of the [[recessive gene|recessive]] methemoglobinemia (met-H) [[gene]], as was a nearby clan with whom the Fugates intermarried.  As a result, many descendants of the Fugates were born with met-H.<ref>''Straight Dope'' [http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a980724.html article on the Fugates of Appalachia, an extended family of blue-skinned people]</ref><ref>''Tri City Herald, November 7, 1974 p.32'' [http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1951&dat=19741107&id=vAsuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QYgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=798,1986312 Newspaper reports on the Blue Fugates]</ref><ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/blue-skinned-people-kentucky-reveal-todays-genetic-lesson/story?id=15759819/ Fugates of Kentucky: Skin Bluer than Lake Louise]</ref>

The "blue men of [[Lurgan]]" were a pair of Lurgan men suffering from what was described as "familial [[idiopathic]] methaemoglobinaemia" who were treated by Dr. James Deeny in 1942.  Deeny, who would later become the Chief Medical Officer of the [[Republic of Ireland]], prescribed a course of [[ascorbic acid]] and [[sodium bicarbonate]].  In case one, by the eighth day of treatment there was a marked change in appearance and by the twelfth day of treatment the patient's complexion was normal. In case two, the patient's complexion reached normality over a month-long duration of treatment.<ref>{{cite book |author=Deeny, James |title=The End of an Epidemic |publisher=A.& A.Farmar |location=Dublin |year= 1995|pages= |isbn=1-899047-06-9 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>
