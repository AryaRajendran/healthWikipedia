'''Dwarfism''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|d|w|ɔr|f|ɪ|z|əm}}) occurs when an individual person or animal is short in stature resulting from a medical condition caused by abnormal (slow or delayed) growth. In humans, dwarfism is sometimes defined as an adult height of less than 147&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;feet 10&nbsp;inches).<ref name="urlMedlinePlus: Dwarfism">{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/dwarfism.html |title=MedlinePlus: Dwarfism |date=2008-08-04|publisher=National Institute of Health|work=MedlinePlus |accessdate=2008-10-03}}</ref> 

Dwarfism can be caused by about 200 distinct medical conditions,<ref name="urlDwarfism" /> such that the symptoms and characteristics of individuals with dwarfism vary greatly. ''Disproportionate'' dwarfism is characterized by one or more body parts being relatively large or small in comparison to those of an average-sized adult, with growth variations in specific areas being apparent. In cases of ''proportionate'' dwarfism, the body appears normally proportioned, but is unusually small.

There is no single treatment for dwarfism. Individual differences, such as [[bone growth]] disorders, sometimes can be treated through surgery, some hormone disorders can be treated through medication, and by hormone replacement therapy; this treatment must be done before the child’s' [[growth plate]]s fuse. Individual accommodations, such as specialized furniture, are often used by people with dwarfism.<ref name="pmid14671400">{{cite journal |author=Hagenäs L, Hertel T |title=Skeletal dysplasia, growth hormone treatment and body proportion: comparison with other syndromic and non-syndromic short children |journal=Horm.

For people, in addition to the medical aspect of the condition, there are social and sociological aspects as well. In the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]], many people with dwarfism prefer to be called '''little people'''.<ref name="LPA">{{cite web  | title = Dwarfism Resources: Frequently Asked Questions  | publisher = Little People of America  | date = 2006-07-09  | url = http://www.lpaonline.org/resources_faq.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060516011550/http://www.lpaonline.org/resources_faq.html | archivedate = 2007-07-12 | accessdate = 2006-11-14 }}</ref>

Historically, the term '''[[midget]]''' was used to describe "proportionate dwarfs"; however, this term is now sometimes<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/midget ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'' Entry for '''midget''': ''sometimes offensive : a very small person; specifically : a person of unusually small size who is physically well-proportioned. '']</ref> regarded as offensive and [[pejorative]] ''(see [[Dwarfism#Terminology|terminology]])'' in people. Another definition for midget is any thing (especially an animal), that is small in proportion to a typical specimen. [[Hypotonia]], or low muscle tone, is common in dwarfs, but intelligence and lifespan are usually normal. Defining dwarfism by height alone is problematic because short stature in itself is not a disorder. For example, [[Pygmy peoples|pygmies]] have adult male heights of less than 150&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;feet 11&nbsp;inches) on average.<ref name="Britannica">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/484571/Pygmy Encyclopædia Britannica - Pygmy], retrieved on 2013-04-25</ref>

For a person with dwarfism, [[heightism]] can lead to ridicule in childhood and discrimination in adulthood.<ref name="UPenn">[http://www.ssc.upenn.edu/~persico/research/Papers/short.pdf University of Pennsylvania, Arts and Sciences: "The Effect of Adolescent Experience on Labor Market Outcomes: The Case of Height"].</ref><ref name="ScienceBlog">[http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2000/A/200000988.html Science Blog: "Short children more likely to be bullied at school"].</ref>

==Classification==
Dwarfism is a medical disorder.  In humans, the sole requirement is being an adult height under {{convert|147|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} and it is almost always classified as to the underlying condition that is the cause for the short stature. Dwarfism is usually caused by a genetic disorder; achondroplasia is caused by a mistake on chromosome four. If dwarfism is caused by a medical disorder, the person is referred to by the underlying diagnosed disorder. Disorders causing dwarfism are often classified by proportionality. Disproportionate dwarfism describes disorders that cause unusual proportions of the body parts, while proportionate dwarfism results in a generally uniform stunting of the body.

Disorders that cause dwarfism may be classified according to one of hundreds of names, which are usually permutations of the following roots:
* location
** '''[[Rhizomelia|rhizomelic]]''' = root, e.g., bones of the upper arm or thigh
** '''mesomelic''' = middle, e.g., bones of the forearm or lower leg
** '''acromelic''' = end, e.g., bones of hands and feet.
** '''micromelic''' = entire limbs are shortened
* source
** '''chondro''' = of cartilage
** '''osteo''' = of bone
** '''spondylo''' = of the vertebrae
** '''plasia''' = form
** '''trophy''' = growth

Examples include [[achondroplasia]], [[osseous dysplasia]], [[chondrodystrophy]], and [[osteochondrodystrophy]].<ref name="titleDwarfism and Dysplasias - Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics">{{cite web |url=http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/dwarfism_and_dysplasias |title=Dwarfism and Dysplasias - Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics |accessdate=2007-12-07 | date=2006-06|publisher=Duke Orthopaedics|format= |work=Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
A typical defining characteristic of dwarfism is an adult height of less than 147&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;ft 10 in) Since those with dwarfism have such a wide range of physical characteristics, variations in individuals are identified by diagnosing and monitoring the underlying disorders. 

It should be noted that short stature can be inherited without any coexisting disease. Short stature in the absence of a medical condition is not generally considered dwarfism. For example, a short man and a short woman with average health will tend to produce children who are also short and with average health. While short parents tend to produce short children, persons with dwarfism may produce children of average height, if the cause of their dwarfism is not genetically transmissible or if the individual does not pass on the genetic variation.

[[File:Dackelpferd.jpg|thumb|left|Dwarfism occurs in animals as well as humans; horses can have [[achondroplastic]] symptoms, as shown here with a person with dwarfism.]]
Disproportionate dwarfism is characterized by one or more body parts being unusually large or small compared to the rest of the body. In [[achondroplasia]] one's trunk is usually of average size, one's limbs being proportionately shorter, one's head usually larger, and a prominent forehead.<ref name='dwarfism-pbshome'/> In at least one case achondroplasia resulted in a significantly smaller trunk and head.<ref name="Worlds smallest woman">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2074927/Indian-declared-worlds-shortest-woman-Jyoti-Amge-dreams-Bollywood.html |title=Meet the worlds smallest woman |work= Daily Mail|accessdate=2012-12-17 |location=London |first=Chris |last=Parsons |date=2011-12-17}}</ref> Facial features are often affected and individual body parts may have problems associated with them. Orthopedic problems can result from multiple conditions such as [[diastrophic dysplasia]] and [[pseudoachondroplasia]].

Proportionate dwarfism is marked by body parts being proportional but smaller.<ref name='mayo-symptoms'>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/dwarfism/DS01012/DSECTION=symptoms |title=Dwarfism: Symptoms |accessdate=2009-01-29 |work=MayoClinic.com |publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research }}</ref> Height is significantly below average and there may be long periods without any significant growth. Sexual development is often delayed or impaired into adulthood. Unlike disproportionate dwarfism, in some cases intellectual disability may be a part of proportionate dwarfism.

Physical maleffects of malformed bones vary according to the specific disease. Many involve joint pain caused by abnormal bone alignment, or from [[nerve]] compression.<ref name="LPA"/> Early degenerative joint disease, exaggerated [[lordosis]] or [[scoliosis]], and constriction of [[spinal cord]] or nerve roots can cause pain and disability.<ref name='seattle-dysplasia'>{{cite web|url=http://orthopedics.seattlechildrens.org/conditions_treated/dwarfism_and_bone_dysplasias.asp |title=Dwarfism and Bone Dysplasias |accessdate=2008-11-18 |publisher=Seattle Children's Hospital, Research & Foundation }}</ref> Reduced [[thorax|thoracic]] size can restrict lung growth and reduce pulmonary function.

Mental effects also vary according to the specific underlying syndrome. In most cases of skeletal dysplasia, such as achondroplasia, mental function is not impaired in any way.<ref name='mayo-symptoms'/> However, there are syndromes which can affect the cranial structure and growth of the brain, severely impairing mental capacity.

The psychosocial limitations of society may be more disabling than the physical symptoms, especially in childhood and adolescence, but people with dwarfism vary greatly in the degree to which social participation and emotional health are affected.

==Causes==
Dwarfism can result from myriad medical conditions, each with its own separate symptoms and causes.  Extreme shortness in humans with proportional body parts usually has a hormonal cause, such as [[Growth hormone deficiency|growth-hormone deficiency]], once called ''pituitary dwarfism''.<ref name="LPA" /><ref name='dwarfism-pbshome'>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2005/bigenough/special_dwarfism_ety.html |title=P.O.V. - Big Enough. What is Dwarfism? |accessdate=2008-11-18 |last=Kennedy |first=Dan |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service }}</ref> Two disorders, achondroplasia and growth hormone deficiency (also known as pituitary dwarfism), are responsible for the majority of human dwarfism cases.<ref name="urlDwarfism">{{cite web |url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/growth/growth/dwarfism.html |title=Dwarfism |work= |accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref>

===Achondroplasia===
{{Further2|[[Achondroplasia]]}}
The most recognizable and most common form of dwarfism in humans is [[achondroplasia]], which accounts for 70% of dwarfism cases and produces rhizomelic short limbs, increased spinal curvature, and distortion of skull growth.   With achondroplasia, the body's limbs are proportionately shorter than the trunk (abdominal area), with a larger head than average and characteristic facial features.  Achondroplasia is an [[autosomal dominant]] disorder caused by the presence of a faulty [[allele]] in the genome. If a pair of achondroplasia alleles are present, the result is fatal. Achondroplasia is a mutation in the [[fibroblast growth factor receptor 3]],<ref>{{Gene|FGFR3}}</ref> which is an inhibitor that regulates bone growth. In cases of achondroplasia, the FGFR3 gene is too aggressive, negatively impacting bone growth.<ref name="urlAchondroplasia - Genetics Home Reference">{{cite web |url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=achondroplasia |title=Achondroplasia - Genetics Home Reference |date=2008-09-26|format= |work=Genetics Home Reference|publisher=National Institute of Health |accessdate=2008-10-01}}</ref>

Research by urologist Harry Fisch of the Male Reproductive Center at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital indicates that in humans this defect may be exclusively inherited from the father and becomes increasingly probable with paternal age; specifically males reproducing after 35.<ref>The Male Biological Clock by Harry Fisch</ref>

===Growth hormone deficiency===
{{Further2|[[Growth hormone deficiency]]}}
Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is a medical condition in which the body produces insufficient [[growth hormone]]. Growth hormone, also called [[somatotropin]], is a [[polypeptide]] [[hormone]] which stimulates [[Human development (biology)|growth]] and cell reproduction. If this hormone is lacking, stunted or even halted growth may become apparent. Children with this disorder may grow slowly and puberty may be delayed by several years or indefinitely. Growth hormone deficiency has no single definite cause. It can be caused by mutations of specific genes, damage to the pituitary gland, [[Turner's syndrome]], poor nutrition,<ref name='ghdeficiency'>{{cite web | publisher = UK Child Growth Foundation | title=Growth Hormone Deficiency |url=http://www.childgrowthfoundation.org/ghd.htm | accessdate=2009-01-16}}</ref> or even stress (leading to [[psychogenic dwarfism]]).

===Other===
Other causes of dwarfism are [[spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita]], [[diastrophic dysplasia]], [[pseudoachondroplasia]], [[hypochondroplasia]], [[Noonan syndrome]], [[primordial dwarfism]], [[Turner syndrome]], [[osteogenesis imperfecta]] (OI) and [[hypothyroidism]]. Severe shortness with skeletal distortion also occurs in several of the [[Mucopolysaccharidosis|Mucopolysaccharidoses]] and other [[lysosomal storage disease|storage disorders]].<ref name="urlCauses of Dwarfism - WrongDiagnosis.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/d/dwarfism/causes.htm |title=Causes of Dwarfism - WrongDiagnosis.com |work= |accessdate=2009-03-23}}</ref>

Serious chronic illnesses may produce dwarfism as a side effect. Harsh environmental conditions, such as malnutrition, may also produce dwarfism. These types of dwarfism are indirect consequences of the generally unhealthy or malnourished condition of the individual, and not of any specific disease. The dwarfism often takes the form of simple short stature, without any deformities. In societies where poor nutrition is widespread, the average height of the population may be reduced below its genetic potential by the lack of proper nutrition.

==Diagnosis==
Dwarfism is often diagnosed in childhood on the basis of visible symptoms. A  physical examination can usually suffice to diagnose certain types of dwarfism, but [[genetic testing]] and diagnostic imaging may be used to determine the exact condition.<ref name="urlDWARFISM (Algorithmic Diagnosis of Symptoms and Signs) - WrongDiagnosis.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/d/dwarfism/book-diseases-1a.htm |title=DWARFISM (Algorithmic Diagnosis of Symptoms and Signs) - WrongDiagnosis.com |work= |accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref> In a person's youth, growth charts that track height can be used to diagnose subtle forms of dwarfism that have no other striking physical characteristics.<ref name="urlDwarfism"/>

Short stature or stunted growth during youth is usually what brings the condition to medical attention. Skeletal [[dysplasia]] is usually suspected because of obvious physical features (e.g., unusual configuration of face or shape of skull), because of an obviously affected parent, or because body measurements (arm span, upper to lower segment ratio) indicate disproportion.<ref name="urlDWARFISM (Algorithmic Diagnosis of Symptoms and Signs) - WrongDiagnosis.com"/> Bone X-rays are often key to diagnosing a specific skeletal dysplasia, but are not the sole diagnostic tool. Most children with suspected skeletal dysplasias are referred to a genetics clinic for diagnostic confirmation and [[genetic counseling]]. Since about the year 2000, genetic tests for some of the specific disorders have become available.<ref name='mayo-diagnosis'>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/dwarfism/DS01012/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis |title=Dwarfism: Tests and diagnosis |accessdate=2008-11-18 |date=2007-08-27 |work=Mayo Clinic |publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research }}</ref>

During an initial medical evaluation of shortness, the absence of disproportion and other clues listed above usually indicates causes other than bone dysplasias. Extreme shortness with completely normal proportions sometimes indicates [[growth hormone deficiency]] (pituitary dwarfism).<ref name='ghd-diagnosis'>{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/PED/topic1810.htm |title=eMedicine - Growth Hormone Deficiency : Article by Stephen Kemp |accessdate=2008-11-18 |last=Kemp |first=Stephen |date=2008-09-15 |work=eMedicine |publisher=WebMD, Inc. }}</ref>

Short stature alone, in the absence of any other abnormalities, may be the result of the distribution of offspring height from short-statured parents, rather than a symptom of any medical condition.<ref name='short-stature-norm'>{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/short_stature_in_children/article_em.htm |title=Short Stature in Children |accessdate=2008-11-18 |work=eMedicineHealth.com |publisher=WebMD, Inc. }}</ref>

==Prevention==
Many types of dwarfism are impossible to prevent because they are genetically caused. Genetic conditions that cause dwarfism may be identified with [[genetic testing]], by screening for the specific variation that result in the condition. However, due to the number of causes of dwarfism, it may be impossible to determine definitively if a child will be born with dwarfism.

Dwarfism resulting from malnutrition or a hormonal abnormality may be treated with an appropriate diet or hormonal therapy. Growth hormone deficiency may be remedied via injections of [[Growth hormone treatment|Human Growth Hormone (HGH)]] during early life.

==Management==
Genetic defects of most forms of dwarfism caused by bone dysplasia cannot be corrected, so therapeutic interventions are typically aimed at preventing or reducing pain or physical disability, increasing adult height, or mitigating psychosocial stresses and enhancing social adaptation.<ref name="mayo-treatment"/>

Forms of dwarfism associated with the endocrine system may be treated using [[hormonal therapy]]. If the cause is prepubescent hyposecretion of growth hormone, supplemental growth hormone may correct the abnormality. If the receptor for growth hormone is itself affected, the condition may prove harder to treat. [[Hypothyroidism]] is another possible cause of dwarfism that can be treated through hormonal therapy. Injections of thyroid hormone can mitigate the effects of the condition, but physical complications may be permanent.

Pain and disability may be ameliorated by physical therapy, braces or other orthotic devices, or by surgical procedures.<ref name='mayo-treatment'/> The only simple interventions that increase perceived adult height are dress enhancements, such as shoe lifts or hairstyle. Growth hormone is rarely used for shortness caused by bone dysplasias, since the height benefit is typically small (less than 5&nbsp;cm [2 in]) and the cost high.<ref name="pmid14671400"/> The most effective means of increasing adult height by several inches is [[distraction osteogenesis]], though availability is limited and the cost is high in terms of money, discomfort, and disruption of life. Most people with dwarfism do not choose this option, and it remains controversial.<ref name="LPA"/> For other types of dwarfism, surgical treatment is not possible.

===Terminology===
[[File:Two Völuspá Dwarves by Frølich.jpg|thumb|Two [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarves]] as depicted in a 19th century edition of the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' poem ''[[Völuspá]]'' (1895) by [[Lorenz Frølich]]]]
The appropriate term for describing a person of particularly short stature (or with the genetic condition achondroplasia) has historically been ambiguous, and has developed euphemistically over the past few centuries.

The noun ''dwarf'' stems from [[Old English]] ''dweorg'', originally referring to a being from [[Germanic mythology]]—a [[dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarf]]—that dwells in mountains and in the earth, and is associated with wisdom, smithing, mining, and crafting. The [[etymology]] of the word ''dwarf'' is contested, and scholars have proposed varying theories about the origins of the being, including that dwarfs may have originated as nature spirits or as beings associated with death, or as a mixture of concepts. Competing etymologies include a basis in the [[Proto-Indo-European root|Indo-European]] root ''*dheur-'' (meaning 'damage'), the Indo-European root ''*dhreugh'' (whence modern German ''Traum'' 'dream' and ''Trug'' 'deception'), and comparisons have been made with the [[Old Indian]] ''dhvaras'' (a type of demonic being). The being may not have gained associations with small stature until a later period.<ref name="SIMEK67-68">[[Rudolf Simek|Simek, Rudolf]] (2007) translated by Angela Hall.

The terms "dwarf", "little person", "LP", and "person of short stature" are now generally considered acceptable by most people affected by these disorders.<ref name='dwarfism-pbshome'/>

"[[Midget]]", whose etymology indicates a "small sandfly,"<ref name='midget-def'>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/midget |title=midget |accessdate=2008-11-18 |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Dictionary.com }}</ref> came into prominence in the mid-19th century after [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] used it in her novels ''Sunny Memories of Foreign Lands'' and ''[[Old Town Folks]]'' where she described children and an extremely short man, respectively.<ref name="dwarfism-pbshome"/>  Later some people of short stature considered the word to be offensive because it was the descriptive term applied to [[P.

In art, literature, or movies, dwarfs are rarely depicted as ordinary people who are very short but rather as a species apart. [[Novelist]]s, [[artist]]s, and [[filmmaking|moviemakers]] may attach special moral or aesthetic significance to their "apartness" or misshapenness.

Artistic representations of dwarfism can be found on [[ancient Greece|Greek]] vases and other ancient artifacts, including [[ancient Egypt]]ian art in which dwarfs are likely to have been seen as a divine manifestation, with records indicating they could reach high positions in society.<ref name="nunn">"''Ancient Egyptian Medicine''",John F.

The [[Bhagavat Purana]] [[Hindu]] text devotes nine chapters to the adventures of [[Vamana]], a dwarf avatar of Vishnu.

Depiction of dwarfs is also found in European paintings and many illustrations. Many European paintings (especially [[Spain|Spanish]]) of the 16th&ndash;19th centuries depict dwarfs by themselves or with others. In the [[Talmud]], it is said that the second born son of the [[Egypt]]ian [[Pharaoh]] of the [[Bible]] was a dwarf.<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/pol/pol09.htm The Talmud - Chapter Vi.

As popular media have become more widespread, the number of works depicting dwarfs has increased dramatically. Some feel that dwarf characters are often depicted based on the novelty factor of their stature rather than on other personal attributes.
