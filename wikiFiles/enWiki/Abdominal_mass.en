An '''abdominal mass''' is any localized enlargement or swelling in the [[human abdomen]]. Depending on its location, the abdominal mass may be caused by an enlarged [[liver]] ([[hepatomegaly]]), enlarged [[spleen]] ([[splenomegaly]]), protruding [[kidney]], a [[pancreatic mass]], a [[retroperitoneal mass]] (a mass in the posterior of the [[peritoneum]]), an [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]], or various [[tumour]]s, such as those caused by [[abdominal carcinomatosis]] and [[omental metastasis]]. The treatments depend on the cause, and may range from [[watchful waiting]] to radical [[surgery]].

==Features==
Many abdominal masses are discovered incidentally during routine [[physical examination]]. When they are present [[symptom]]atically, abdominal masses are most frequently associated with [[pain]] or digestive problems. However, depending on the cause, masses may be associated with other [[sign (medical)|sign]]s and symptoms, such as [[jaundice]] or [[bowel obstruction]].

==Diagnosis==
The first steps in diagnosis are a [[medical history]] and physical examination. Important clues during history include [[weight loss]], [[diarrhea]] and [[abdominal pain]].

During physical examination, the clinician must identify the location of the mass, as well as characterize its location (usually specified in terms of [[Quadrant (anatomy)|quadrants]]). The mass should be assessed for whether it is rigid or mobile. It should also be characterized for pulse or [[peristalsis]], as these would help in further identifying the mass.

Routine [[blood test]]s are usually the next step in diagnosis after a thorough medical history and physical examination. They should include a [[full blood count]], [[blood urea nitrogen]] (BUN), [[creatinine]], and [[liver function tests]] such as [[Liver function tests#Albumin|albumin]], [[international normalized ratio]] (INR), [[partial thromboplastin time]] (PTT), [[serum amylase]] and [[Liver function tests#Total bilirubin|total bilirubin]] (TBIL). If late-stage [[liver disease]] is suspected, then a [[Liver function tests#Serum glucose|serum glucose]] may be appropriate.

==Common causes==
* [[Abdominal aortic aneurysm]]
* [[Bladder distention]]
* [[Cholecystitis]] (an [[inflammation]] of the [[gallbladder]])
* [[Colorectal cancer|Colon cancer]]
* [[Crohn's disease]]
* [[Bowel obstruction]]
* [[Diverticulitis]]
* Gallbladder tumor
* [[Hydronephrosis]] (fluid-filled kidney)
* [[Kidney cancer]] (including [[renal cell carcinoma]])
* [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|Liver cancer]]
* [[Hepatomegaly]] (Liver enlargement)
* [[Neuroblastoma]]
* [[Ovarian cyst]]
* [[Pancreatic abscess]]
* [[Pancreatic pseudocyst]]
* [[Splenomegaly]] (Spleen enlargement)
* [[Stomach cancer]]
* [[Uterine leiomyoma]] (fibroids)
* [[Volvulus]] (twisted piece of the [[gastrointestinal tract]])
* [[Uretero-pelvic junction]] obstruction
