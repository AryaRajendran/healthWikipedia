'''Malignant histiocytosis''' (also known as "Histiocytic medullary reticulosis"<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|744}}) is a rare [[hereditary disease]] found in the [[Bernese Mountain Dog]] and humans, characterized by [[histiocyte|histiocytic]] infiltration of the lungs and [[lymph node]]s.  The [[liver]], [[spleen]], and [[central nervous system]] can also be affected.  Histiocytes are a component of the [[immune system]] that proliferate abnormally in this disease.  In addition to its importance in veterinary medicine, the condition is also important in human pathology.<ref>[http://dermnetnz.org/dermal-infiltrative/malignant-histiocytoses.html Malignant histiocytoses.

==Histiocytic disorders==
A histiocyte is a differentiated tissue cell that has its origin in the [[bone marrow]].  The source for histiocytes is the [[monocyte]]/[[macrophage]] line.  Monocytes (found in the blood) and macrophages (found in tissue) are responsible for [[phagocytosis]] (ingestion) of foreign material in the body.  [[Langerhans cell]]s are [[dendritic cell]]s found in the skin and function by internalizing [[antigen]]s (foreign particles) and presenting them to [[T cell]]s.  They arise from monocytes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ginhoux F, Tacke F, Angeli V, Bogunovic M, Loubeau M, Dai XM, Stanley ER, Randolph GJ, Merad M |title=Langerhans cells arise from monocytes in vivo |journal=Nat. Immunol. |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=265–73 |year=2006 |pmid=16444257 |doi=10.1038/ni1307}}</ref>  Histiocytic disorders refer to diseases that are caused by abnormal behavior of these cells.  They include the following:
*Reactive diseases of Langerhans cells (most important feature in immune histochemistry is expression of E-cadherin)
**[[Histiocytoma (dog)|Histiocytoma]]s
*Reactive histiocytosis (immunohistochemical features show that interstitial/dermal DCs are involved)
**Cutaneous [[histiocytosis]] (CH)
**Systemic histiocytosis (SH)
*Reactive diseases of macrophages
**[[Hemophagocytic syndrome]] - a condition where macrophages phagocytose [[myeloid]] and [[erythroid]] precursors (similar to [[HLH (Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis)|hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis]] in humans)
*Histiocytic sarcoma complex (immunohistochemical features of dendritic cells, possibly interdigitating or perivascular DCs)
**Malignant histiocytosis
**Diffuse [[histiocytic sarcoma]]
**Localized histiocytic sarcoma
*Malignant diseases of macrophages
**[[Histiocytic lymphoma]]

==Breed disposition==
Up to 25 percent of Bernese Mountain Dogs may develop malignant histiocytosis in their lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|author=Parker, A.G., Rutteman, G.R., Cadieu, E., et al.|year=2006|title=Malignant Histiocytosis in the Bernese Mountain Dog: Design and Execution of a Case-Control Study|work=Genes, Dogs and Cancer: Fourth Annual Canine Cancer Conference| url=http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/keystone/2006/sessionB/parker/chapter.asp?la=1|accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref>  Other breeds with a possible genetic tendency toward malignant histiocytosis include [[Rottweiler]]s, [[Flat-Coated Retriever]]s, and [[Golden Retriever]]s.<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author=Ettinger, Stephen J.;Feldman, Edward C.|title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|year=1995|isbn=0-7216-6795-3}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
The disease in the lungs is characterized by enlargement of the tracheobronchial lymph nodes and infiltration of the lungs, sometimes leading to lung lobe consolidation and [[pleural effusion]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Kessler, Martin|year=2006|title=Radiographic diagnosis of primary and metastatic lung tumors|work=Proceedings of the North American Veterinary Conference| url=http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/navc/2006/SAE/275.pdf?LA=1|accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref>  Signs and symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, weight loss, anemia, and difficulty breathing.<ref>{{cite web | last = Affolter | first = Verena K. | title = Histiocytic Proliferative Diseases in Dogs and Cats | work = Proceedings of the 29th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2004 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2004&PID=8600&O=Generic | accessdate = 2007-01-28 }}</ref>  [[Seizure]]s and rear limb weakness can be seen.  Invasion of the bone marrow can cause [[pancytopenia]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Kearns | first = Shawn Ann | coauthors = Ewing, Patty | title = Causes of canine and feline pancytopenia | journal = Compendium on Continuing Education for the Practicing Veterinarian | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 122–133 | publisher = Veterinary Learning Systems | date = Feb. 2006 }}</ref>  Diagnosis requires a [[biopsy]].

==Treatment==
Treatment with [[chemotherapy]] has been used with some success, particularly using [[lomustine]], [[prednisone]], [[doxorubicin]], and [[cyclophosphamide]].<ref name=DVM>{{cite journal | last = Cronin | first = Kim | title = Deciphering the histiocytic code | journal = DVM | pages = 1S–8S | publisher = Advanstar Communications | date = Dec. 2006 }}</ref>  Because of the rapid progression of this aggressive disease, the [[prognosis]] is very poor.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Affolter V, Moore P |title=Localized and disseminated histiocytic sarcoma of dendritic cell origin in dogs |journal=Vet Pathol |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=74–83 |year=2002 |pmid=12102221 |doi=10.1354/vp.39-1-74}}</ref>

==Other histiocytic diseases in Bernese Mountain Dogs==
A similar disease is '''diffuse histiocytic sarcoma''', a term used to designate a localized histiocytic sarcoma that has spread throughout the body.<ref name=DVM/>

Another disease of histiocytic origin that affects Bernese Mountain Dogs is '''systemic histiocytosis'''.  This condition generally begins as lesions on the [[eyelid]]s, nasal [[mucous membrane|mucosa]], and skin, especially the [[scrotum]].  It progresses to a more generalized disease affecting the lymph nodes, bone marrow and spleen.<ref>{{cite web | title = Tumors with Histiocytic Differentiation | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/72232.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-28 }}</ref>  Other signs and symptoms include weight loss and loss of appetite.<ref name=DVM/>  It also has a very poor prognosis.
