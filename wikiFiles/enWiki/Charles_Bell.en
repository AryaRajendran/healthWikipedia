Sir '''Charles Bell''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms= [[Knight of the Hanoverian Guelphic Order|KH]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of London|FRS]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|FRCSE]] [[Member of the Wernerian Society|MWS]]}} (12 November 1774{{spaced ndash}}28 April 1842) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] surgeon, [[anatomist]], [[neurologist]] and [[philosophical theologian]].

His three older brothers included [[John Bell (surgeon)|John Bell]] (1763–1820), also a noted surgeon and writer; and the advocate [[George Joseph Bell]] (1770–1843).

==Life==
Charles Bell was born in [[Edinburgh]] on 12 November 1774,<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1211566921.html Highbeam]</ref> a son of the Rev William Bell, a clergyman of the [[Episcopal Church of Scotland]], who died in 1779 when Bell was a small child. Bell grew up in Edinburgh, attending the [[High School Edinburgh|High School]] (1784-8) and [[Edinburgh University]], where he took his medical degree in 1798. He conducted his surgical training as assistant to his elder brother John Bell.

He and his brother had artistic gifts, and together they taught anatomy and illustrated and published two volumes of ''A System of Dissection Explaining the Anatomy of the Human Body''. Bell's career was characterized by the accumulation of quite extraordinary honours and achievements - and by acrimonious disputes unusual even by the standards of medicine during the [[British Regency|Regency]].

Shortly after his graduation Bell was admitted to the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|Royal College of Surgeons]] in Edinburgh, where he operated and taught anatomy. He and his brother published two additional volumes of their anatomical treatise in 1802 and 1804. Some aspects of his success, however, led to the jealous opposition of local physicians, and he was barred from practice at the [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]]. He then moved to [[London]] in 1804, where he set up a private surgery and school of anatomy. From 1812 to 1825, together with his brother, Bell ran the Great Windmill Street School of Anatomy, which had been founded by the anatomist [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]] (1718–1783). He also served as a military surgeon, making elaborate recordings of neurological injuries at the [[Royal Hospital Haslar]] and famously documenting his experiences at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in 1815, where the anatomist [[Robert Knox]] commented very negatively on Bell's surgical abilities; (the mortality rate of amputations carried out by Bell ran at about 90%). Bell was instrumental in the creation of the [[Middlesex Hospital]] Medical School, and became, in 1824, the first professor of Anatomy and Surgery of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|College of Surgeons in London]]. In 1829, the Windmill Street School of Anatomy was incorporated into the new [[King's College London]]. Bell was invited to be its first professor of [[physiology]], but resigned shortly afterwards. Wishing to return to Scotland, he accepted in 1836 the position of Professor of Surgery at the [[University of Edinburgh]].

Bell died in the Midlands, travelling back from Edinburgh to London, in 1842.

==Honours and Awards==
Bell was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]] on 8 June 1807, on the nomination of [[Robert Jameson]], [[William Wright (botanist)|William Wright]] and [[Thomas Macknight]]. He served as a Councillor of the RSE from 1836-9.

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society of London]] on 16 November 1826,<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=9&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27bell%27%29 | title = Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher = Royal Society|accessdate =12 December 2010}}</ref> was [[knight]]ed in 1831 and, like [[Sir Richard Owen]], was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

==Works==

Charles Bell was a prolific author. Shortly after arriving in London, he set his sights on the Chair of Anatomy at the [[Royal Academy]], and, in furtherance of this career goal, he published ''Essays on The Anatomy of Expression in Painting'' (1806), later re-published as ''Essays on The Anatomy and Philosophy of Expression'' in 1824. In this work, Bell followed the principles of [[natural theology]], asserting the existence of a uniquely human system of [[facial muscles]] in the service of a [[human species]] with a unique relationship to the [[Creator deity|Creator]]. After the failure of his application, (Sir [[Thomas Lawrence]], later President of the Royal Academy, described Bell as "lacking in temper, modesty and judgement"), Bell turned his attentions to the nervous system.

Bell published detailed studies of the [[nervous system]] in 1811, in his privately circulated book ''An Idea of a New Anatomy of the Brain''.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1318665/pdf/janatphys00211-0151.pdf] He described his experiments with animals and later emphasised how he was the first to distinguish between [[sensory nerve|sensory]] and [[motor nerve]]s. This essay is considered by many to be the founding stone of clinical [[neurology]]. However, Bell's ''original'' essay of 1811 did not actually contain a clear description of motor and sensory [[nerve roots]] as Bell later claimed, and he seems to have issued subsequent incorrectly dated revisions with subtle textual alterations. [[Charles Darwin]] (and others) found in Bell's published views more evidence of his personal ambitions than of proper scientific enquiry. Nevertheless, Bell's studies on [[emotional expression]], flawed though they were, played a catalytic role in the development of Darwin's considerations of the origins of human emotional life; and Darwin very much agreed with Bell's emphasis on the expressive role of the [[muscles of respiration]]. Darwin detailed these opinions in his [[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]] (1872), written with the active collaboration of the psychiatrist [[James Crichton-Browne]]. 
Bell was one of the first physicians to combine the scientific study of neuroanatomy with clinical practice. In 1821, he described in the trajectory of the [[facial nerve]] and a disease, [[Bell's Palsy]] which led to the unilateral paralysis of facial muscles, in one of the classics of neurology, a paper to the Royal Society entitled ''On the Nerves: Giving an Account of some Experiments on Their Structure an Functions, Which Lead to a New Arrangement of the System.''

He also combined his many artistic, scientific, literary and teaching talents in a number of wax preparations and detailed anatomical and surgical illustrations, paintings and engravings in his several books on these subjects, such as in his book ''Illustrations of the Great Operations of Surgery: Trepan, Hernia, Amputation, Aneurism, and Lithotomy'' (1821). He wrote also the first treatise on notions of anatomy and physiology of [[facial expression]] for painters and illustrators, titled ''Essays on the Anatomy of Expression in Painting'' (1806). In 1833 he published the fourth [[Bridgewater Treatise]], ''The Hand: Its Mechanism and Vital Endowments as Evincing Design''.

A number of discoveries received his name:
* Bell's (external respiratory) nerve: The long thoracic nerve.
* [[Bell's palsy]]: a unilateral [[idiopathic]] [[paralysis]] of facial muscles due to a lesion of the [[facial nerve]].
* [[Bell's phenomenon]]: An upward movement of the [[human eye|eye]] and the [[eyelid]] which occurs when a person affected with Bell's paralysis tries to close the eye.
* [[Bell's spasm]]: Involuntary twitching of the [[facial muscles]].
* [[Bell-Magendie law]] or Bell's Law: States that the anterior branch of [[spinal nerve]] roots contain only motor fibers and the posterior roots contain only sensory fibers.<ref name=TMHP>{{cite-TMHP|Bell's Law, within the description of Bell's Palsy, including a brief discussion about Charles Bell, 1774-1842}}, page 92.</ref>
