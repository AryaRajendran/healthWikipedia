'''Vitamin K deficiency''' is a form of [[avitaminosis]] resulting from insufficient [[vitamin K]]<sub>1</sub> or vitamin K<sub>2</sub> or both.

==Vitamin K<sub>'''1'''</sub> Deficiency==
Vitamin K<sub>1</sub>-deficiency may occur   by disturbed intestinal uptake (such as would occur in a [[bile duct]] obstruction), by therapeutic or accidental intake of a vitamin K<sub>1</sub>-antagonist such as [[warfarin|coumadin]], or, very rarely, by nutritional vitamin K<sub>1</sub> deficiency. As a result, Gla-residues are inadequately formed and the Gla-proteins are insufficiently active.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms include [[ecchymosis]],<ref name=emedicine/> [[petechiae]],<ref name=emedicine/> [[hematoma]]s,<ref name=emedicine/> oozing of blood at surgical or puncture sites, stomach pains; risk of massive uncontrolled bleeding; cartilage calcification; and severe malformation of developing bone or deposition of insoluble calcium salts in the walls of arteries. 

In infants, it can cause some birth defects such as underdeveloped face, nose, bones, and fingers.<ref name=emedicine/>

==Vitamin K<sub>'''2'''</sub> Deficiency==
According to a study published in the October 14, 2008 edition of PLoS Medicine, Vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (5&nbsp;mg of K<sub>1</sub>/day) does not protect against age-related decreasing bone density, but may protect against fractures and cancers, in postmenopausal women<ref>[http://newswise.com/articles/view/545216/ Vitamin K Does Not Prevent Bone Density Loss, but May Prevent Fractures and Cancers] Newswise, Retrieved on October 13, 2008.</ref> taking calcium and vitamin D supplements.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050196 |title=Vitamin K Supplementation in Postmenopausal Women with Osteopenia (ECKO Trial): A Randomized Controlled Trial |year=2008 |author=Angela M.

[[Menatetrenone|Menaquinone]] (vitamin K<sub>2</sub>), but not [[phylloquinone]] (vitamin K<sub>1</sub>), intake is associated with reduced risk of [[Coronary heart disease|CHD]] [[Death|mortality]], all-cause mortality and severe aortic calcification.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Geleijnse JM, Vermeer C, Grobbee DE, ''et al.'' |title=Dietary intake of menaquinone is associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease: the Rotterdam Study |journal=J.

==Prevalence==
The prevalence of vitamin K deficiency varies by geographic region.

For infants in the United States, vitamin K<sub>1</sub> deficiency without bleeding may occur in as many as 50% of infants younger than 5 days old.<ref name=emedicine>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/126354-overview Vitamin K Deficiency] eMedicine. Author: Pankaj Patel, MD. Coauthor(s): Mageda Mikhail, MD, Assistant Professor. Updated: Dec 18, 2008</ref> Therefore, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that 0.5 to 1.0&nbsp;mg Vitamin K<sub>1</sub> be administered to all newborns shortly after birth.<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Controversies concerning vitamin K and the newborn.

Postmenopausal and elderly women in Thailand have high risk of Vitamin K<sub>2</sub> deficiency, compared with the normal value of young, reproductive females.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bunyaratavej N |title=[Experience of vitamin K2 in Thailand] |language=Japanese |journal=Clin Calcium |volume=17 |issue=11 |pages=1752–60 |year=2007 |pmid=17982197 }}</ref>
Current dosage recommendations for Vitamin K may be too low.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Adams J, Pepping J |title=Vitamin K in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis and arterial calcification |journal=Am J Health Syst Pharm |volume=62 |issue=15 |pages=1574–81 |year=2005 |pmid=16030366 |doi=10.2146/ajhp040357}}</ref>

The deposition of calcium in soft tissues, including arterial walls, is quite common, especially in those suffering from [[atherosclerosis]], suggesting that Vitamin K deficiency is more common than previously thought.<ref name="Berkner">{{cite journal |author=Berkner KL, Runge KW |title=The physiology of vitamin K nutriture and vitamin K-dependent protein function in atherosclerosis |journal=J.
