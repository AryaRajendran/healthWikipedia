A '''teratoma''' is an encapsulated [[neoplasia|tumor]] with [[biological tissue|tissue]] or [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] components resembling ''normal'' derivatives of all three [[germ layer]]s. The tissues of a teratoma, although normal in themselves, may be quite different from surrounding tissues and may be highly disparate; teratomas have been reported to contain [[hair]], [[teeth]], [[bone]] and, very rarely, more complex organs or processes such as [[eyes]],<ref name="pmid6540049">{{cite journal

Usually, however, a teratoma will contain no organs but rather one or more tissues normally found in organs such as the [[brain]], [[thyroid]], [[liver]], and [[lung]].  Sometimes, the teratoma has within its capsule one or more fluid-filled cysts; when a large cyst occurs, there is a potential for the teratoma to produce a structure within the cyst that resembles a fetus.  Because they are encapsulated, teratomas are usually [[Benign tumor|benign]], although several forms of [[cancer|malignant]] teratoma are known and some of these are common forms of teratoma.  A mature teratoma is typically benign and found more commonly in women, while an immature teratoma is typically malignant and is more often found in men.

Teratomas are thought to be present at birth ([[congenital]]), but small ones are often not discovered until much later in life.

Definitive [[medical diagnosis]] of a teratoma is based on its [[histology]];  this diagnosis is made by a [[Pathology|pathologist]].

==Terminology==
There are some differences in terminology in the U.S. and U.K. The words "teratoma" (U.S. terminology) and "mature teratoma" (U.K. terminology) both may be used to refer to a benign growth, while the word "teratoma" (U.K. terminology) may refer to "immature teratoma", a cancerous growth. It is therefore important to specify whether one is using U.S. or U.K. terminology.

The term "malignant teratoma" has sometimes been used as a synonym for [[Germ cell tumor|nonseminomatous germ cell tumor]].<ref name="pmid8096954">{{cite journal

==Pathophysiology==
{{main|Germ cell tumor}}
Teratomas belong to a class of tumors known as [[nonseminoma]]tous [[germ cell tumor]] (N.S.G.C.T.).  All tumors of this class are the result of abnormal development of [[pluripotent]] cells: [[germ cell]]s and [[embryo|embryonal cells]]. Teratomas of embryonic origin are [[congenital disorder|congenital]]; teratomas of germ cell origin may or may not be congenital (this is not known). The kind of pluripotent cell appears to be unimportant, apart from constraining the location of the teratoma in the body.

Teratomas derived from germ cells occur in the [[testes]] in men and [[ovary|ovaries]] in women. Teratomas derived from embryonic cells usually occur on the subject's midline: in the brain, elsewhere in the [[skull]], in the nose, in the tongue, under the tongue, and in the [[neck]] (cervical teratoma), [[mediastinum]], [[retroperitoneum]], and attached to the [[coccyx]].  However, teratomas may also occur elsewhere: very rarely in solid organs (most notably the heart and liver) and hollow organs (such as the stomach and bladder), and more commonly on the [[cranial sutures|skull sutures]].

===Hypotheses of origin===

Concerning the origin of teratomas, there exist numerous hypotheses.<ref name="Gonzalez-Crussi1982">Gonzalez-Crussi, F. (1982) Extragonadal Teratomas.  Atlas of Tumor Pathology, Second Series, Fascicle 18.  [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]], Washington D.C.</ref>  These hypotheses are not to be confused with the unrelated hypothesis that [[fetus in fetu]] (see below) is not a teratoma at all but rather a [[parasitic twin]].

===Mature teratoma===<!-- [[Mature teratoma]] redirects here -->
[[File:Mature teratoma, mediastinum.jpg|thumb|Mature teratoma of the mediastinum. A horizontal slice of the resected tumor reveals fibrofatty tissue, calcified areas, and a few cystic spaces lined with smooth membrane and containing a hair. In the left lower corner, the involved B5 bronchus is evident.]]
A '''mature teratoma''' is a grade 0 teratoma.  Mature teratomas are highly variable in form and histology, and may be solid, cystic, or a combination of solid and cystic.  A mature teratoma often contains several different types of tissue such as [[skin]], [[muscle]], and [[bone]].  Skin may surround a cyst and grow abundant [[hair]] (see [[#Dermoid cyst|Dermoid cyst]]).  Mature teratomas generally are benign;  malignant mature teratomas are of several distinct types.

=== Dermoid cyst ===
[[File:Mature cystic teratoma of ovary.jpg|thumb|left|A small (4 cm) dermoid cyst of an ovary, discovered during a [[C-section]]]]

A [[dermoid cyst]] is a mature cystic teratoma containing hair (sometimes very abundant) and other structures characteristic of normal skin and other tissues derived from the [[ectoderm]]. The term is most often applied to teratoma on the skull sutures and in the ovaries of females.

{{clear left}}
=== Fetus in fetu and fetiform teratoma===
[[Fetus in fetu]] and '''fetiform teratoma''' are rare forms of mature teratoma that include one or more components resembling a malformed fetus.  Both forms may contain or appear to contain complete organ systems, even major body parts such as torso or limbs.  Fetus in fetu differs from fetiform teratoma in having an apparent [[vertebral column|spine]] and [[bilateral symmetry]].<ref name="Gonzalez-Crussi1982"/>

Most authorities agree that fetiform teratomas are highly developed mature teratomas;  the natural history of fetus in fetu, however, is controversial.<ref name="Gonzalez-Crussi1982"/>  There also may be a cultural difference, with fetiform teratoma being reported more often in ovarian teratomas (by gynecologists) and fetus in fetu being reported more often in retroperitoneal teratomas (by general surgeons).  [[Fetus in fetu]] has often been interpreted as a [[fetus]] growing within its [[twin]].  As such, this interpretation assumes a special complication of [[twin]]ning, one of several grouped under the term [[parasitic twin]].  In this regard, it is noteworthy that in many cases the fetus in fetu is reported to occupy a fluid-filled cyst within a mature teratoma.<ref name="pmid6724790">{{cite journal

Regardless of whether fetus in fetu and fetiform teratoma are one entity or two, they are distinct from and not to be confused with [[ectopic pregnancy]].

=== Struma ovarii ===
{{main|Struma ovarii}}
A '''struma ovarii''' (literally: [[goitre]] of the ovary) is a rare form of mature teratoma that contains mostly [[thyroid]] tissue.

==Classification==

Regardless of location in the body, a teratoma is classified according to a [[cancer staging]] system.  This indicates whether [[chemotherapy]] or [[radiation therapy]] may be needed in addition to surgery.  Teratomas commonly are classified using the Gonzalez-Crussi<ref name="Gonzalez-Crussi1982"/> grading system: 0 or mature ([[benign]]); 1 or immature, probably benign; 2 or immature, possibly [[malignant]] ([[cancer]]ous); and 3 or frankly malignant. If frankly malignant, the tumor is a [[cancer]] for which additional [[cancer staging]] applies.

Teratomas are also classified by their content: a solid teratoma contains only tissues (perhaps including more complex structures); a cystic teratoma contain only pockets of fluid or semi-fluid such as [[cerebrospinal fluid]], [[sebum]], or fat; a mixed teratoma contains both solid and cystic parts. Cystic teratomas usually are grade 0 and, conversely, grade 0 teratomas usually are cystic.

Grade 0, 1 and 2 pure teratomas have the potential to become malignant (grade 3), and malignant pure teratomas have the potential to [[metastasize]].  These rare forms of '''teratoma with malignant transformation''' may contain elements of somatic (non germ cell) malignancy such as [[leukemia]], [[carcinoma]] or [[sarcoma]].<ref name="pmid17080330">{{cite journal

A teratoma may contain elements of other germ cell tumors, in which case it is not a pure teratoma but rather is a '''mixed''' [[germ cell tumor]] and is malignant.  In infants and young children, these elements usually are [[endodermal sinus tumor]], followed by [[choriocarcinoma]].  Finally, a teratoma can be pure and not malignant yet highly aggressive:  this is exemplified by '''growing teratoma syndrome''', in which chemotherapy eliminates the malignant elements of a mixed tumor, leaving pure teratoma which paradoxically begins to grow very rapidly.

=== Malignant transformation===

A "benign" grade 0 (mature) teratoma nonetheless has a risk of malignancy.  Recurrence with malignant [[endodermal sinus tumor]] has been reported in cases of formerly benign mature teratoma,<ref name="pmid9781660">{{cite journal

=== Extraspinal ependymoma ===

[[ependymoma|Extraspinal ependymoma]], usually considered to be a [[glioma]] (a type of non-germ cell tumor), may be an unusual form of mature teratoma.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aktuğ T, Hakgüder G, Sarioğlu S, Akgür FM, Olguner M, Pabuçcuoğlu U |title=Sacrococcygeal extraspinal ependymomas: the role of coccygectomy |journal=J.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Teratom 001-03.png|thumb|CT showing a teratoma of the ovary: fatty formation with a smooth boundary, with a dense part, possibly a tooth.]]
Teratomas are thought to be present since birth, or even before birth, and therefore can be considered [[congenital]] tumors. However, many teratomas are not diagnosed until much later in childhood or in adulthood. Large tumors are more likely to be diagnosed early on. Sacrococcygeal and cervical teratomas are often detected by prenatal [[ultrasound]]. Additional diagnostic methods may include prenatal [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]. In rare circumstances, the tumor is so large that the [[fetus]] may be damaged or die. In the case of large sacrococcygeal teratomas, a significant portion of the fetus' [[blood flow]] is redirected toward the teratoma (a phenomenon called [[steal syndrome]]), causing [[Congestive heart failure|heart failure]], or [[hydrops fetalis|hydrops]], of the fetus. In certain cases, [[fetal surgery]] may be indicated.

Beyond the newborn period, symptoms of a teratoma depend on its location and organ of origin. [[Ovarian]] teratomas often present with abdominal or [[Chronic pelvic pain|pelvic pain]], caused by [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] of the [[ovary]] or irritation of its ligaments. A recently discovered condition where ovarian teratomas cause encephalitis associated with antibodies against the [[N-methyl-D-aspartate]] receptor (NMDAR) - often simply referred to as "[[Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis]]", was identified as a serious complication. Patients develop a multistage illness that progresses from psychosis, memory deficits, seizures, and language disintegration into a state of unresponsiveness with catatonic features often associated with abnormal movements, and autonomic and breathing instability.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dalmau J, Lancaster E, Martinez-Hernandez E, Rosenfeld MR, Balice-Gordon R |title=Clinical experience and laboratory investigations in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=63–74 |year=2011 |month=January |pmid=21163445 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(10)70253-2 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1474-4422(10)70253-2 |pmc=3158385}}</ref> Testicular teratomas present as a palpable mass in the [[testis]]; [[mediastinum|mediastinal]] teratomas often cause compression of the lungs or the airways and may present with [[chest pain]] and/or respiratory symptoms.

Some teratomas contain [[yolk sac]] elements, which secrete [[alpha-fetoprotein]] (AFP). Detection of AFP may help to confirm the diagnosis and is often used as a marker for recurrence or treatment efficacy, but is rarely the method of initial diagnosis. (Maternal serum [[alpha-fetoprotein]], or MSAFP, is a useful [[Screening (medicine)|screening test]] for other fetal conditions, including [[Down syndrome]], [[spina bifida]] and [[Layers of the abdominal wall|abdominal wall]] defects such as [[gastroschisis]]).

==Time of presentation==

Teratomas of germ cell origin usually are found (''i.e.,'' present) in adult men and women, but they may also be found in children and infants. Teratomas of embryonal origin are most often found in babies at birth, in young children, and, since the advent of [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound imaging]], in fetuses.

The most commonly diagnosed fetal teratomas are [[sacrococcygeal teratoma]] (Altman types I, II, and III) and cervical (neck) teratoma.  Because these teratomas project from the fetal body into the surrounding [[Amniotic sac|amniotic fluid]], they can be seen during routine prenatal ultrasound exams.  Teratomas within the fetal body are less easily seen with ultrasound;  for these, MRI of the pregnant uterus is more informative.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Danzer E, Hubbard AM, Hedrick HL, ''et al.'' |title=Diagnosis and characterization of fetal sacrococcygeal teratoma with prenatal MRI |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=187 |issue=4 |pages=W350–6 |year=2006 |pmid=16985105 |doi=10.2214/AJR.05.0152 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kocaoglu M, Frush DP |title=Pediatric presacral masses |journal=Radiographics |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=833–57 |year=2006 |pmid=16702458 |doi=10.1148/rg.263055102 |url=}}</ref>

==Complications==

Teratomas are not dangerous for the fetus unless there is either a [[mass effect (medicine)|mass effect]] or a large amount of blood flow through the tumor (known as ''vascular steal''). The mass effect frequently consists of obstruction of normal passage of fluids from surrounding organs.  The vascular steal can place a strain on the growing heart of the fetus, even resulting in heart failure, and thus must be monitored by fetal [[echocardiography]].

After surgery, there is a risk of regrowth in place, or in nearby organs.<ref>{{Cite journal

==Treatment==
===Surgery===
The treatment of choice is complete surgical removal (''i.e.,'' complete resection).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tapper D, Lack EE |title=Teratomas in infancy and childhood.

Exceptions include teratomas in the brain, and very large, complex teratomas that have pushed into and become interlaced with adjacent muscles and other structures.

Prevention of recurrence does not require ''en bloc'' resection of surrounding tissues.

===Chemotherapy===
For malignant teratomas, usually, surgery is followed by chemotherapy.

Teratomas that are in surgically inaccessible locations, or are very complex, or are likely to be malignant (due to late discovery and/or treatment) sometimes are treated first with chemotherapy.

===Follow-up===
Although often described as benign, a teratoma does have malignant potential.  In a UK study of 351 infants and children diagnosed with "benign" teratoma reported 227 with MT, 124 with IT.  Five years after surgery, event-free survival was 92.2% and 85.9%, respectively, and overall survival was 99% and 95.1%.<ref name="pmid18541896">{{cite journal

Depending on which tissue(s) it contains, a teratoma may secrete a variety of chemicals with systemic effects. Some teratomas secrete the "pregnancy hormone" [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (βhCG), which can be used in clinical practice to monitor the successful treatment or relapse in patients with a known HCG-secreting teratoma. This hormone is not recommended as a diagnostic marker, because most teratomas do not secrete it. Some teratomas secrete [[thyroxine]], in some cases to such a degree that it can lead to clinical [[hyperthyroidism]] in the patient. Of special concern is the secretion of [[alpha-fetoprotein]] (AFP); under some circumstances AFP can be used as a diagnostic marker specific for the presence of [[yolk sac]] cells within the teratoma.  These cells can develop into a frankly malignant tumor known as [[yolk sac tumor]] or [[endodermal sinus tumor]].

Adequate follow-up requires close observation, involving repeated physical examination, scanning (ultrasound, MRI, or CT), and measurement of AFP and/or βhCG.<ref name="pmid10561269">{{cite journal

==Epidemiology==
Embryonal teratomas most commonly occur in the sacrococcygeal region: [[sacrococcygeal teratoma]] is the single most common tumor found in newly born humans.

Of teratomas on the skull sutures, approximately 50% are found in or adjacent to the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]].<ref>{{EMedicine|oph|620|Orbital dermoid cyst}}</ref>   '''Limbal dermoid''' is a '''[[choristoma]]''', not a teratoma.

Teratoma qualifies as a [[rare disease]], but is not extremely rare.  Sacrococcygeal teratoma alone is diagnosed at birth in one out of 40,000 humans.  Given the current human population and birth-rate, this equals five per day or 1800 per year.  Add to that number sacrococcygeal teratomas diagnosed later in life, and teratomas in other locales, and the [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] approaches ten thousand new diagnoses of teratoma per year.

Teratomas also occur, rarely, in other species.<ref name="pmid18622858">{{cite journal

==Research==

In light of the [[Stem cell controversy|ethical issues surrounding the source of human stem cells]], teratomas are being looked at as an alternative source for research because they lack the potential to grow into functional human beings.
