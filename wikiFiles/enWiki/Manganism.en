'''Manganism''' or '''manganese [[poison]]ing''' is a [[toxic]] condition resulting from chronic exposure to [[manganese]] and first identified in 1837 by [[James Couper (academic)|James Couper]].<ref name="Couper1837">{{cite journal | last = Couper | first = J. | title = Sur les effets du peroxide de manganèse | journal =  Journal de chimie médicale, de pharmacie et de toxicologie | year= 1837 | volume = 3 | pages= 223–225  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=WpQ3AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA233}}</ref>

== Presentation ==
Chronic exposure to excessive Mn levels can lead to a variety of psychiatric and motor disturbances, termed manganism. Generally, exposure to ambient Mn air concentrations in excess of 5&nbsp;mg Mn/m3 can lead to Mn-induced symptoms.<ref name="libres.uncg.edu">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06534.x | url = http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/K_Erickson_Ferroportin_2009.pdf | title = Ferroportin is a manganese-responsive protein that decreases manganese cytotoxicity and accumulation | year = 2010 | last1 = Yin | first1 = Zhaobao | last2 = Jiang | first2 = Haiyan | last3 = Lee | first3 = Eun-Sook Y. | last4 = Ni | first4 = Mingwei | last5 = Erikson | first5 = Keith M. | last6 = Milatovic | first6 = Dejan | last7 = Bowman | first7 = Aaron B. | last8 = Aschner | first8 = Michael | journal = Journal of Neurochemistry | volume = 112 | issue = 5 | pages = 1190–8 | pmid = 20002294 | pmc = 2819584}}</ref>

In initial stages of manganism, neurological symptoms consist of reduced response speed, irritability, mood changes, and compulsive behaviors.<ref name="pmid16629164">{{cite journal |author=Roth JA |title=Homeostatic and toxic mechanisms regulating manganese uptake, retention, and elimination |journal=Biol.

Symptoms are also similar to [[Motor neurone disease|Lou Gehrig's disease]] and [[multiple sclerosis]].

== Causes ==

Manganism has become an active issue in [[occupational safety and health|workplace safety]] as it has been the subject of numerous [[product liability]] lawsuits against manufacturers of [[arc welding]] supplies. In these lawsuits, welders have accused the manufacturers of failing to provide adequate warning that their products could cause welding fumes to contain dangerously high manganese concentrations that could lead welders to develop manganism. Companies employing welders are also being sued, for what  colloquially is known as "welders' disease." However, studies fail to show any link between employment as a welder and manganism (or other neurological problems).<ref>Fryzek JP, Hansen J, Cohen S, Bonde JP, Llambias MT, Kolstad HA, Skytthe A, Lipworth L, Blot WJ, Olsen JH.

== Pathological mechanisms ==

Manganese may affect [[liver]] function, but the threshold of acute toxicity is very high. On the other hand, more than 95% of manganese is eliminated by biliary excretion. Any existing liver damage may slow this process, increasing its concentration in blood plasma.<ref name="Ballatori2000">Ballatori N. Molecular mechanisms of hepatic metal transport.

Increased [[ferroportin]] protein expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells is associated with decreased intracellular Mn concentration and attenuated cytotoxicity, characterized by the reversal of Mn-reduced [[glutamate]] uptake and diminished [[lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH) leakage.<ref name="libres.uncg.edu"/>

The [[Red River Delta]] near [[Hanoi]] has high levels of manganese or [[arsenic]] in the water. Approximately 65 percent of the region’s wells contain high levels of arsenic, manganese, selenium and barium.<ref>http://www.watertechonline.com/news.asp?N_ID=75635</ref> This was also published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]].
