A '''penicillin drug reaction''' is an [[adverse drug reaction]] associated with the use of [[penicillin]].

Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (≥1% of patients) associated with use of the penicillins include [[diarrhea]], [[hypersensitivity]], [[nausea]], rash, [[neurotoxicity]], [[urticaria]], and [[superinfection]] (including [[candidiasis]]). Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include fever, vomiting, [[erythema]], [[dermatitis]], [[angioedema]], [[seizures]] (especially in people with epilepsy), and [[pseudomembranous colitis]].<ref name=AMH2006>{{cite book | editor=Rossi S, editor | title=[[Australian Medicines Handbook]] | year=2006 | location=Adelaide | publisher=Australian Medicines Handbook | isbn=0-9757919-2-3}}</ref>

Pain and inflammation at the injection site is also common for [[Parenteral#Parenteral_by_injection_or_infusion|parenteral]]ly administered benzathine benzylpenicillin, benzylpenicillin, and, to a lesser extent, procaine benzylpenicillin.

Although penicillin is still the most commonly reported [[allergy]], less than 20% of all patients that believe that they have a penicillin allergy are truly allergic to penicillin;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Salkind AR, Cuddy PG, Foxworth JW |title=Is this patient allergic to penicillin?

Allergic reactions to any [[β-lactam antibiotic]] may occur in up to 1% of patients receiving that agent.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Solensky R |title=Hypersensitivity reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics |journal=Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=201–20 |year=2003 |pmid=12721392 |doi=10.1385/CRIAI:24:3:201}}</ref> The allergic reaction is a [[Type I hypersensitivity]] reaction. [[Anaphylaxis]] will occur in approximately 0.01% of patients.<ref name="AMH2006" /> It has previously been accepted that there was up to a 10% cross-sensitivity between penicillin-derivatives, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, due to the sharing of the β-lactam ring.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dash CH |title=Penicillin allergy and the cephalosporins |journal=J.
