'''Meconium aspiration syndrome''' ('''MAS''', alternatively "Neonatal aspiration of meconium") is a medical condition affecting newborn infants. It occurs when [[meconium]] is present in their lungs during or before delivery. Meconium is the first [[Feces|stool]] of an [[infant]], composed of materials ingested during the time the infant spends in the [[uterus]].

Meconium is normally stored in the infant's intestines until after birth, but sometimes (often in response to fetal distress) it is expelled into the amniotic fluid prior to birth, or during labor.  If the baby then inhales the contaminated fluid, respiratory problems may occur.

==Signs and symptoms==

The most obvious sign that meconium has been passed during or before labor is the greenish or yellowish appearance of the amniotic fluid.  The infant's skin, umbilical cord, or nailbeds may be stained green if the meconium was passed a considerable amount of time before birth.  These symptoms alone do not necessarily indicate that the baby has inhaled in the fluid by gasping in utero or after birth. After birth, rapid or labored breathing, cyanosis, slow heartbeat, a barrel-shaped chest or low [[Apgar score]] are all signs of the syndrome. Inhalation can be confirmed by one or more tests such as using a [[stethoscope]] to listen for abnormal lung sounds (diffuse crackles and [[rhonchi]]), performing [[blood gas]] tests to confirm a severe loss of lung function, and using chest X-rays to look for patchy or streaked areas on the lungs. Infants who have inhaled meconium may develop [[respiratory distress syndrome]] often requiring [[mechanical ventilation|ventilatory support]]. Complications of MAS include [[pneumothorax]] and [[persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn]].

==Causes==
[[Fetal distress]] during labor causes intestinal contractions, as well as relaxation of the anal sphincter, which allows meconium to pass into the amniotic fluid and contaminate the amniotic fluid. Meconium passage into the amniotic fluid occurs in about 5-20 percent of all births and is more common in overdue births. Of the cases where meconium is found in the amniotic fluid, meconium aspiration syndrome develops less than 5 percent of the time.<ref>{{cite pmid|7617354}}</ref> Amniotic fluid is normally clear, but becomes greenish if it is tinted with meconium.

==Pathophysiology and Mechanism==
The pathophysiology of MAS is due to a combination of primary surfactant deficiency and surfactant inactivation as a result of plasma proteins leaking into the airways from areas of epithelial disruption and injury.<ref name="Wirbelauer2009">{{cite pmid|19399004}}</ref>

The leading three causes of MAS are
# Due to physiologic maturational event,<ref name="Klinger1999">{{cite pmid|10612363}}</ref>
# A response to acute hypoxic events,<ref name="Klinger1999"/> and
# A response to chronic intrauterine hypoxia.<ref name="Klinger1999"/>

If an infant inhales this mixture before, during, or after birth, it may be sucked deep into the lungs. Three main problems occur if this happens:
:* the material may block the airways
:* efficiency of gas exchange in the lungs is lowered
:* the meconium-tainted fluid is irritating, inflaming airways ([[pneumonitis]]) and possibly leading to chemical [[pneumonia]].
These can lead to possibly fatal or long term health problems for the infant.<ref name="Klinger1999"/>

==Diagnosis==

High risk infants may be identified by fetal tachycardia, bradycardia or absence of fetal accelerations upon CTG in utero, at birth the infant may look cachexic and show signs of yellowish meconium staining on skin, nail and the umbillical cord, these infants usually progress onto Infant Respiratory distress syndrome within 4 hours. Investigations which can confirm the diagnosis are fetal chest x-ray, which will show hyperinflation, diaphragmatic flattening, cardiomegaly and pathy atelectasis, and ABG samples, which will show decreased oxygen levels.

MAS is difficult to prevent.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The risk of MAS increases after the 40th week of pregnancy.<ref name="Cheng2008">{{cite pmid|18928977}}</ref>

==Treatment==
''[[Amnioinfusion]]'', a method of thinning thick meconium that has passed into the amniotic fluid through pumping of sterile fluid into the amniotic fluid, has not shown a benefit in treating MAS .<ref name="Hofmeyr2009">{{cite pmid|19822401}}</ref><ref name="Xu2007">{{cite pmid|17378813}}</ref> Until recently it had been recommended that the throat and nose of the baby be suctioned by the delivery attendant as soon as the head is delivered. However, new studies have shown that this is not useful and the revised [[Neonatal Resuscitation Program|Neonatal Resuscitation Guidelines]] published by the American Academy of Pediatrics no longer recommend it.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} When meconium staining of the amniotic fluid is present and the baby is born depressed, it is recommended by the guidelines that an individual trained in [[intubation|neonatal intubation]] use a [[laryngoscope]] and [[endotracheal tube]] to suction meconium from below the [[vocal cords]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

If the condition worsens to a point where treatments are not affecting the newborn as they should, [[extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] (ECMO) can be necessary to keep the infant alive.<ref name="Short2008">{{cite pmid|19057615}}</ref>

[[Lucinactant]] (Surfaxin) is used as a treatment of MAS.<ref name="Halliday2006">{{cite pmid|16770072}}</ref><ref name="Donn2005">{{cite pmid|15833063}}</ref><ref name="Wiswell2002">{{cite pmid|12042546}}</ref> Albumin-lavage has not demonstrated to benefit outcomes of MAS.<ref name="Salvesen2008">{{cite pmid|19012188}}</ref> Steroid use has not demonstrated to benefit the outcomes of MAS.<ref name="Ward2003">{{cite pmid|14583981}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The mortality rate of meconium-stained infants is considerably higher than that of non-stained infants; meconium aspiration used to account for a significant proportion of neonatal deaths. Residual lung problems are rare but include symptomatic cough, wheezing, and persistent hyperinflation for up to 5-10 yr. The ultimate prognosis depends on the extent of CNS injury from asphyxia and the presence of associated problems such as pulmonary hypertension. 

==Epidemiology==
In a study conducted between 1995 and 2002, MAS occurred in 1061 of 2,490,862 live births, reflecting an incidence of 0.43 of 1000. MAS requiring intubation occurs at higher rates in pregnancies beyond 40 weeks. 34% of all MAS cases born after 40 weeks required intubation compared to 16% prior to 40 weeks.<ref name="Dargaville2006">{{cite pmid|16651329}}</ref>
