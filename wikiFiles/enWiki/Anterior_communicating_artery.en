In [[human anatomy]], the '''anterior communicating artery''' is a [[blood vessel]] of the [[brain]] that connects the left and right [[anterior cerebral artery|anterior cerebral arteries]].  

The anterior communicating artery connects the two anterior cerebral arteries across the commencement of the [[longitudinal fissure]]. Sometimes this vessel is wanting, the two arteries joining together to form a single trunk, which afterward divides; or it may be wholly, or partially, divided into two. Its length averages about 4 mm, but varies greatly. It gives off some of the anteromedial ganglionic vessels, but these are principally derived from the anterior cerebral artery.

It is part of the [[circle of Willis|cerebral arterial circle]], also known as the [[circle of Willis]].

==Pathology==
[[Aneurysm]]s of the anterior communicating artery are the most common circle of Willis aneurysm<ref>Beck J, Rohde S, Berkefeld J, Seifert V, Raabe A.
