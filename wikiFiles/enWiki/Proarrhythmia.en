'''Proarrhythmia''' is a new or more frequent occurrence of pre-existing [[arrhythmia]]s, paradoxically precipitated by antiarrhythmic therapy, which means it is a [[Adverse effect|side effect]] associated with the administration of some existing [[Antiarrhythmic agent|antiarrhythmic drugs]], as well as drugs for other indications.  In other words, it is a tendency of antiarrhythmic drugs to facilitate emergence of new arrhythmias.

==Types of proarrhythmia==
According to the [[Vaughan Williams classification]] (VW) of [[antiarrhythmic]] drugs, there are 3 main types of Proarrhythmia during treatment with various antiarrhythmic drugs for [[Atrial Fibrillation]] or [[Atrial flutter]]:

===Ventricular proarrhythmia===
*[[Torsade de pointes]] (VW type IA and type III drugs)
*Sustained [[monomorphic ventricular tachycardia]] (usually VW type IC drugs)
*Sustained [[polymorphic ventricular tachycardia]]/[[ventricular fibrillation]] without long QT (VW types IA, IC, and III drugs)

===Atrial proarrhythmia===
*Conversion of atrial fribrillation to flutter (usually VW type IC drugs or amiodarone).  May be a desired effect.
*Increase of [[defibrillation threshold]] (a potential problem with VW type IC drugs)
*Provocation of recurrence (probably VW types IA, IC and III drugs).  It is rare.

===Abnormalities of conduction or impulse formation===
*[[Sinus node]] dysfunction, [[atrioventricular block]] (almost all drugs)
*Accelerate conduction over accessory pathway ([[digoxin]], intravenous [[verapamil]], or [[diltiazem]])
*Acceleration of [[ventricular rate]] during atrial fibrillation (VW type IA and type IC drugs).

==Increased risk==
*Presence of [[structural heart disease]], especially [[LV systolic dysfunction]]. 
*Class IC agents. 
*Increased age. 
*Females.

==Clinical pointers==
===Class IA drugs=== 
*Dose independent, occurring at normal levels. 
*Follow QT interval, keep ms.  
===Class IC drugs=== 
*May be provoked by increased heart rate. 
*Exercise stress tests after loading. 
===Class III drugs=== 
*Dose dependent. 
*Follow bradycardia, prolonged QT closely.
