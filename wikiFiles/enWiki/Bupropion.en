Medically, bupropion serves as a non-tricyclic antidepressant fundamentally different to most commonly prescribed antidepressants such as [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors|SSRIs]].

Initially researched and marketed as an antidepressant, bupropion was subsequently found to be effective as a smoking cessation aid. With over 20 million retail prescriptions in 2007, it was the fourth-most prescribed antidepressant in the United States retail market after [[sertraline]], [[escitalopram]], and [[fluoxetine]].<ref>The bupropion prescriptions were calculated as a total of prescriptions for Wellbutrin XL, Budeprion XL, Budeprion SR, Bupropion SR and Bupropion ER using data from the charts for generic and brand-name drugs, see: {{cite web | url = http://www.drugtopics.com/drugtopics/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=491181 | title = Top 200 Generic Drugs by Units in 2007| accessdate = 2008-03-30 |date = 2008-02-18| format = PDF| publisher = Drug Topics}} and {{cite web | url = http://www.drugtopics.com/drugtopics/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=491207 | title = Top 200 Brand Drugs by Units in 2007| accessdate = 2008-03-30 | author = Verispan|date = 2008-02-18| format = PDF | publisher = Drug Topics}}</ref>

Bupropion lowers [[seizure threshold]], and its potential to cause seizures has been widely publicized. However, at the recommended dose, the risk of seizures is comparable to that observed for other antidepressants.<ref name=" Johnston " /> Bupropion is an effective antidepressant on its own, but it is particularly popular as an add-on medication in the cases of incomplete response to the first-line [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) antidepressant. In contrast to many other antidepressants, bupropion does not cause [[weight gain]] or [[sexual dysfunction]]; in most studies, groups placed on bupropion showed statistically significant increases in sexual functioning ([[libido]]), and mild to moderate [[weight loss]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.v66n1019f |title=Weight Gain, Sexual Dysfunction, and Bupropion |year=2005 |last1=Menaster |first1=Michael J. |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=66 |issue=10 |pages=1335–6; author reply 1336–9 |pmid=16259554}}</ref>

===Smoking cessation===
Bupropion reduces the severity of [[nicotine]] cravings and [[withdrawal]] symptoms.
After a seven-week treatment, 27% of subjects who received bupropion reported that an urge to smoke was a problem, versus 56% of those who received [[placebo]].

===Sexual dysfunction===
Bupropion is one of few antidepressants that do not cause sexual dysfunction.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/JCP.0b013e3181a5233f |title=Treatment-Emergent Sexual Dysfunction Related to Antidepressants |year=2009 |last1=Serretti |first1=Alessandro |last2=Chiesa |first2=Alberto |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=259–66 |pmid=19440080}}</ref> According to a survey of psychiatrists, it is the drug of choice for the treatment of [[SSRI]]-induced sexual dysfunction, although this is not an indication approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). 36% of psychiatrists preferred switching patients with SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction to bupropion, and 43% favored the augmentation of the current medication with bupropion.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/10401230209147450 |title=The Pharmacologic Management of SSRI-Induced Side Effects: A Survey of Psychiatrists |year=2002 |last1=Dording |first1=Christina |last2=Mischoulon |first2=David |last3=Petersen |first3=Timothy |last4=Kornbluh |first4=Rebecca |last5=Gordon |first5=Johanna |last6=Nierenberg |first6=Andrew |last7=Rosenbaum |first7=Jerrold |last8=Fava |first8=Maurizio |journal=Annals of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=143–7 |pmid=12585563}}</ref> There are studies demonstrating the efficacy of both approaches; improvement of the desire and orgasm components of sexual function were the most often noted.

===Obesity===
A recent [[meta-analysis]] of [[anti-obesity drug|anti-obesity medication]]s pooled the results of three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of bupropion. It confirmed the efficacy of bupropion given at 400&nbsp;mg per day for treating [[obesity]]. Over a period of 6 to 12 months, weight loss in the bupropion group (4.4&nbsp;kg) was significantly greater than in the placebo group (1.7&nbsp;kg). The same review found the differences in weight loss between bupropion and other established weight-loss medications, such as [[sibutramine]], [[orlistat]] and [[diethylpropion]], not to be statistically significant.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15809465 |year=2005 |last1=Li |first1=Z |last2=Maglione |first2=M |last3=Tu |first3=W |last4=Mojica |first4=W |last5=Arterburn |first5=D |last6=Shugarman |first6=LR |last7=Hilton |first7=L |last8=Suttorp |first8=M |last9=Solomon |first9=V |title=Meta-analysis: Pharmacologic treatment of obesity |volume=142 |issue=7 |pages=532–46 |journal=Annals of internal medicine}}</ref> Combinations of bupropion and [[zonisamide]] ([[Empatic]]) and of bupropion and [[naltrexone]] ([[Contrave]]) are currently being studied for obesity.<ref name="pmid19885278">{{cite journal |pmid=19885278 |year=2008 |last1=Klonoff |first1=DC |last2=Greenway |first2=F |title=Drugs in the pipeline for the obesity market |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=913–8 |pmc=2769782 |journal=Journal of diabetes science and technology}}</ref>

A study of prophylactic bupropion for the prevention of smoking among teenagers with ADHD yielded unexpected results. The teenagers taking bupropion were two times more likely (close to statistical significance) to begin smoking than the teenagers in the placebo group. However, because significance was not reached, this difference can be attributed entirely to chance. At the same time, the sub-group of patients taking stimulants in addition to bupropion or placebo had a five times lower risk of smoking initiation.<ref name="pmid17685748">{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.v68n0718 |title=A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial of Bupropion for the Prevention of Smoking in Children and Adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder |year=2007 |last1=Monuteaux |first1=Michael C. |last2=Spencer |first2=Thomas J. |last3=Faraone |first3=Stephen V. |last4=Wilson |first4=Angela M. |last5=Biederman |first5=Joseph |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=68 |issue=7 |pages=1094–101 |pmid=17685748}}</ref>

===Other uses===
Bupropion improves mood by increasing the concentration of [[dopamine]] in emotional brain regions. The mechanism may improve the negative mood associated with methamphetamine withdrawal. Though it has demonstrated no effectiveness in the treatment of cocaine dependence, there is weak evidence that it may be useful in methamphetamine dependence.<ref name=Kampman>{{cite journal |pmid=18497715 |year=2008 |last1=Kampman |first1=KM |title=The search for medications to treat stimulant dependence |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=28–35 |pmc=2797110 |journal=Addiction science & clinical practice |doi=10.1151/ascp084228}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
GlaxoSmithKline advises that bupropion should not be prescribed to individuals with [[epilepsy]] or other conditions that lower the [[seizure threshold]], such as alcohol or [[benzodiazepine]] withdrawal, [[anorexia nervosa]], [[bulimia]], or active brain tumors. It should be avoided in individuals who are also taking [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs). When switching from MAOIs to bupropion, it is important to include a washout period of about two weeks between the medications.<ref name="WellbutrinPI"/> The prescribing information approved by the FDA recommends that caution should be exercised when treating patients with liver damage, severe [[kidney disease]], and severe [[hypertension]], as well as in pediatric patients, adolescents and young adults due to the increased risk of [[suicidal ideation]].<ref name="WellbutrinPI"/>

According to a [[retrospective]] [[case series]] published in 1993, bupropion treatment may exacerbate [[tic]]s in children with co-occurring [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] and [[Tourette syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004583-199301000-00030 |title=Case Study: Bupropion Exacerbates Tics in Children with Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Tourette's Syndrome |year=1993 |last1=Spencer |first1=Thomas |last2=Biederman |first2=Joseph |last3=Steingard |first3=Ronald |last4=Wilens |first4=Timothy |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry |volume=32 |pages=211–4 |pmid=8428875 |issue=1}}</ref> No further research of this side effect has been conducted.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Adverse effects==
[[Seizure]] is the most controversial side effect of bupropion, and was responsible for its initial withdrawal from the market. The risk of seizure is highly dose-dependent, but is also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300 mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300–400&nbsp;mg.<ref name=Hales>Hales E and Yudofsky JA, eds, The American Psychiatric Press Textbook of Psychiatry, Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc., 2003</ref> The immediate release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.4% for dosages below 450 mg; the incidence climbs to 5% for dosages between 450-600 mg per day.<ref name=Hales/> For comparison, the incidence of the first unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%. The risk of seizure for other antidepressants is as follows: 0.1–0.6% for [[imipramine]], depending on dosage; 0–0.06% for [[amitriptyline]], depending on dosage; 0.5% for [[clomipramine]]; 0.4% for [[maprotiline]]; and 0.2% for [[fluoxetine]] and [[fluvoxamine]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2165/00002018-200225020-00004 |title=Effects of Psychotropic Drugs on Seizure Threshold |year=2002 |last1=Pisani |first1=Francesco |last2=Oteri |first2=Giancarla |last3=Costa |first3=Cinzia |last4=Di Raimondo |first4=Giorgio |last5=Di Perri |first5=Raoul |journal=Drug Safety |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=91–110 |pmid=11888352}}</ref> Experiments on mice indicate that increased susceptibility to seizure is a general side effect of chronically using antidepressants that inhibit norepinephrine transporters, such as [[imipramine]], [[desipramine]] and [[reboxetine]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300847 |title=The Effects of Chronic Norepinephrine Transporter Inactivation on Seizure Susceptibility in Mice |year=2005 |last1=Ahern |first1=Todd H |last2=Javors |first2=Martin A |last3=Eagles |first3=Douglas A |last4=Martillotti |first4=Jared |last5=Mitchell |first5=Heather A |last6=Liles |first6=Larry Cameron |last7=Weinshenker |first7=David |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=730–8 |pmid=16052243}}</ref> Clinical depression itself was reported to increase the occurrence of seizures two-to-sevenfold compared with the general population; in this light, the above statistics could indicate that low to moderate doses of antidepressants, including bupropion, may actually have an anti-convulsive action.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.09.023 |title=Seizure Incidence in Psychopharmacological Clinical Trials: An Analysis of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Summary Basis of Approval Reports |year=2007 |last1=Alper |first1=Kenneth |last2=Schwartz |first2=Kelly A. |last3=Kolts |first3=Russell L. |last4=Khan |first4=Arif |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=345–54 |pmid=17223086}}</ref>

In the UK, more than 7,600 reports of suspected adverse reactions were collected in the first two years after bupropion's approval by the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] as part of the [[Yellow Card Scheme]], which monitored side effects. Approximately 540,000 people were treated with bupropion for smoking cessation during that period. The MHRA received 60 reports of "''suspected'' [emphasis MHRA's] adverse reactions to Zyban which had a fatal outcome".

===Psychiatric===
The FDA requires all antidepressants, including bupropion, to carry a [[black box warning]] stating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on a statistical analysis conducted by the FDA which found a 2-fold increase of the [[suicidal ideation]] and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase of suicidality in the 18–24 age group.<ref name=FDA>{{cite web | author = Levenson M, Holland C| title =Antidepressants and Suicidality in Adults: Statistical Evaluation. (Presentation at Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee; December 13, 2006)|accessdate = 2007-05-13 | url = http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/slides/2006-4272s1-04-FDA.ppt | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) }}</ref>

[[Suicidal ideation]] and behavior in clinical trials are rare. For the above analysis, the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants for psychiatric indications in order to obtain [[statistically significant]] results. Considered separately, bupropion and nine other antidepressants were not statistically different from placebo. Only [[fluoxetine]] caused a significant decrease in suicidal ideation.<ref name=FDA/>

Suicidal behavior is less likely when bupropion is prescribed for smoking cessation. According to a 2007 [[Cochrane Library|Cochrane Database]] review, there have been four suicides per one million prescriptions and one case of suicidal ideation per ten thousand prescriptions of bupropion for smoking cessation in the UK. The review concludes, "Although some suicides and deaths while taking bupropion have been reported, thus far there is insufficient evidence to suggest they were caused by bupropion."<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000031.pub3 |title=Antidepressants for smoking cessation |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2007 |last1=Hughes |first1=John R |last2=Stead |first2=Lindsay F |last3=Lancaster |first3=Tim |editor1-last=Hughes |editor1-first=John R |pmid=17253443 |issue=1 |pages=CD000031}}</ref>

Two years later, the FDA issued a health advisory, which warned that the prescription of bupropion and [[varenicline]] for smoking cessation has been associated with reports about unusual behaviour changes, agitation and hostility. Some patients have become depressed or have had their depression worsen, have had thoughts about suicide or dying, or have attempted suicide.<ref name=warning>{{cite web | title = Public Health Advisory: FDA Requires New Boxed Warnings for the Smoking Cessation Drugs Chantix and Zyban | date = 2009-07-01 |accessdate = 2009-07-03 | url = http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/PublicHealthAdvisories/ucm169988.htm | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) }}</ref><ref name=warning2>{{cite web | title = Information for Healthcare Professionals: Varenicline (marketed as Chantix) and Bupropion (marketed as Zyban, Wellbutrin, and generics) | date = 2009-07-01 |accessdate = 2009-07-03 | url = http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/ucm169986.htm | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) }}</ref> This advisory was based on the postmarket review of anti-smoking products, which identified 153 reports of the suicidal adverse events for varenicline over the first year it was marketed and 75 reports for bupropion over ten years.

[[Mania]] is one of the rare side effects of bupropion. The prescribing information notes that "it is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials)" that, should an episode of depression actually be the first presentation of [[bipolar disorder]], treating it with antidepressants, including bupropion, may precipitate a manic episode.<ref name="WellbutrinPI"/> More recent data indicate that the addition of newer antidepressants, including bupropion, to a [[mood stabilizer]] does not cause the switch to mania more often than the addition of placebo.<ref name="pmid15337640"/> Moreover, when added to a mood stabilizer, bupropion and sertraline had a twice lower switch risk than venlafaxine.<ref name="pmid16880481">{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.105.013045 |title=Mood switch in bipolar depression: Comparison of adjunctive venlafaxine, bupropion and sertraline |year=2006 |last1=Post |first1=R.

Like many of the antidepressants, bupropion is associated with the potential risk for causing anxiety as a side effect. How common or severe this anxiety is remains to be fully discovered. Some studies show that it has similar anxiety side effects to the SSRI antidepressants, while others show an elevated risk for [[akathisia]], or extreme anxiety, as high as 13.9%, or three times that from sertraline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://healthlifeandstuff.com/2010/02/wellbutrin-and-anxiety-concerns/ |title=Wellbutrin – Anxiety Treatment Concerns |publisher=Health and Life }}</ref>

===Interactions===
Since bupropion is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the [[CYP2B6]] enzyme, drug interactions with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like [[paroxetine]], [[sertraline]], [[norfluoxetine]] (the active metabolite of [[fluoxetine]]), [[diazepam]], [[clopidogrel]], and [[orphenadrine]]. The expected result is the increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 [[enzyme induction and inhibition|inducers]], such as [[carbamazepine]], [[clotrimazole]], [[rifampicin]], [[ritonavir]], [[St John's Wort]], [[phenobarbitone]], [[phenytoin]] and others.<ref name="pmid16368442">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2005.11.011 |title=Bupropion for major depressive disorder: Pharmacokinetic and formulation considerations |year=2005 |last1=Jefferson |first1=James W. |last2=Pradko |first2=James F. |last3=Muir |first3=Keith T. |journal=Clinical Therapeutics |volume=27 |issue=11 |pages=1685–95 |pmid=16368442}}</ref>

Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold; accordingly, extreme care should be taken when prescribing bupropion with other medications that also lower it, such as antipsychotics, [[theophylline]], [[steroid]]s, and some [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s.<ref name="WellbutrinPI"/> Its combination with [[nicotine replacement therapy|nicotine replacement therapies]] can elevate blood pressure.  Despite this adverse consequence, some studies suggest that using bupropion in conjunction with Nicotine Replacement Therapy (specifically, a nicotine patch) could improve tobacco cessation rates.<ref>Jorenby DE, Leischow SJ, Nides MA et al A controlled trial of sustained release bupropion, a nicotine patch , or both for smoking cessation N Engl J Med. 1999;340:685-691</ref>  

The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold.<ref name="WellbutrinPI"/> A small study conducted by GlaxoSmithKline indicated that bupropion (100&nbsp;mg) may counteract the subjective effects of small doses of alcohol (16–32&nbsp;mL, slightly less than 1–2 standard US drinks). The volunteers reported feeling more sober and clear-headed and less sedated. Bupropion also reduced the detrimental effect of alcohol on auditory vigilance. The combination of bupropion (100&nbsp;mg) and two drinks of alcohol increased heart rate by six beats per minute, a statistically significant increase.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02395210 |title=The effect of bupropion, a new antidepressant drug, and alcohol and their interaction in man |year=1984 |last1=Hamilton |first1=M.

==Detection in biological fluids==
Bupropion may be quantitated in blood, plasma or serum to monitor therapeutic use, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. The drug is unstable in biological fluids at room temperature and therefore specimens should be maintained at the coldest possible temperature prior to analysis.<ref>Baselt, R.

Bupropion does not inhibit [[monoamine oxidase]] or serotonin reuptake.

It has several active [[metabolite]]s: ''R,R''-hydroxybupropion, ''S,S''-hydroxybupropion, ''threo''-hydrobupropion and ''erythro''-hydrobupropion, which are further metabolized to inactive metabolites and eliminated through excretion into the urine. Pharmacological data on bupropion and its metabolites are presented in Table 1. Bupropion is known to weakly inhibit the [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptor]], with a 14% potency of its dopamine uptake inhibition, and the [[histamine H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub> receptor]], with a 9% potency.<ref name = "horst1998"/>

The biological activity of bupropion can be attributed to a significant degree to its active metabolites, in particular to ''S,S''-hydroxybupropion. GlaxoSmithKline developed this metabolite as a separate drug called [[radafaxine]],<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.biospace.com/news_story.aspx?StoryID=18222420&full=1 | title = GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Reviews Novel Therapeutics For CNS Disorders And Confirms Strong Pipeline Momentum | date = November 23, 2004 | accessdate = 2007-08-18 | publisher = PRNewswire}}</ref> but discontinued development in 2006 due to "an unfavourable risk/benefit

Bupropion is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by [[CYP2B6]], an [[isoenzyme]] of the [[cytochrome P450|cytochrome P450 system]]. Alcohol causes an increase of CYP2B6 in the liver, and persons with a history of alcohol use metabolize bupropion faster. The mechanism of formation of ''erythro''-hydrobupropion and ''threo''-hydrobupropion has not been studied but is probably mediated by one of the carbonyl reductase enzymes. The metabolism of bupropion is highly variable: the effective doses of bupropion received by persons who ingest the same amount of the drug may differ by as much as 5.5 times (and the half-life from 3 to 16 hours), and of hydroxybupropion by as much as 7.5 times (and the half-life from 12 to 38 hours).<ref name="pmid14515060">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00008571-200310000-00005 |title=Bupropion and 4-OH-bupropion pharmacokinetics in relation to genetic polymorphisms in CYP2B6 |year=2003 |last1=Kirchheiner |first1=Julia |last2=Klein |first2=Christian |last3=Meineke |first3=Ingolf |last4=Sasse |first4=Johanna |last5=Zanger |first5=Ulrich M |last6=Mürdter |first6=Thomas E |last7=Roots |first7=Ivar |last8=Brockmöller |first8=Jürgen |journal=Pharmacogenetics |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=619–26 |pmid=14515060}}</ref><ref name="pmid15083067">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00008571-200404000-00002 |title=Pharmacogenetic determinants of interindividual variability in bupropion hydroxylation by cytochrome P450 2B6 in human liver microsomes |year=2004 |last1=Hesse |first1=Leah M |last2=He |first2=Ping |last3=Krishnaswamy |first3=Soundararajan |last4=Hao |first4=Qin |last5=Hogan |first5=Kirk |last6=Moltke |first6=Lisa Lvon |last7=Greenblatt |first7=David J |last8=Court |first8=Michael H |journal=Pharmacogenetics |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=225–38 |pmid=15083067}}</ref> Based on this, some researchers have advocated monitoring of the blood level of bupropion and hydroxybupropion.<ref name="pmid1813908">{{cite journal |pmid=1813908 |year=1991 |last1=Preskorn |first1=SH |title=Should bupropion dosage be adjusted based upon therapeutic drug monitoring? |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=637–43 |journal=Psychopharmacology bulletin}}</ref>

There have been two reported cases of false-positive urine amphetamine tests in persons taking bupropion.

==Synthesis==
Bupropion is synthesized by brominating 3'-chloropropiophenone, followed by [[nucleophilic substitution]] with [[t-butylamine|''t''-butylamine]].<ref name="United States Patent: 3819706"/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ed077p1479 |title=A Short, One-Pot Synthesis of Bupropion (Zyban, Wellbutrin) |year=2000 |last1=Perrine |first1=Daniel M. |last2=Ross |first2=Jason T. |last3=Nervi |first3=Stephen J. |last4=Zimmerman |first4=Richard H. |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=77 |issue=11 |pages=1479 |bibcode=2000JChEd..77.1479P}}</ref> It is a [[substituted cathinone]], or in other words, a derivative of [[cathinone]].

In their efforts to find [[smoking cessation]] agents, F.

Although structurally unrelated to bupropion, F. Ivy Carroll, ''et al.'' recently (2011) disclosed a number of 3-[[phenyltropanes]] that had some [[nAChR]] activity.<ref name="morpholine"/>

Through reading the above citations it would be possible to draw up possible SARs. To give an example, extending the α-methyl chain in bupropion to C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub> (presumed n-propyl), improved the [<sup>3</sup>H]DA IC<sub>50</sub> from 658nM to 56nM. Extending the α-methyl to an α-ethyl also improved [<sup>3</sup>H]DA IC<sub>50</sub> to 209nM. According to work done on [[sibutramine]] though, the absolute optimum chain length in these compounds is an iso-butyl radical. This has been confirmed by [[P. Meltzer]] ''et al.'' in his seminal paper on [[naphyrone]] analogs.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/jm050797a |title=1-(4-Methylphenyl)-2-pyrrolidin-1-yl-pentan-1-one (Pyrovalerone) Analogues:  A Promising Class of Monoamine Uptake Inhibitors |year=2006 |last1=Meltzer |first1=Peter C. |last2=Butler |first2=David |last3=Deschamps |first3=Jeffrey R. |last4=Madras |first4=Bertha K. |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=1420–32 |pmid=16480278 |pmc=2602954}}</ref> [[Mark Froimowitz]], ''et al.'' also explored the effect of replacing the carbomethoxy group in Ritalin with different alkyl groups.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/jo201415h |title=Solution- and Solid-State Conformations of C(α)-Alkyl Analogues of Methylphenidate (Ritalin) Salts: Avoidance ofgauche+gauche–Interactions |year=2011 |last1=Steinberg |first1=Avital |last2=Froimowitz |first2=Mark |last3=Parrish |first3=Damon A. |last4=Deschamps |first4=Jeffrey R. |last5=Glaser |first5=Robert |journal=The Journal of Organic Chemistry |volume=76 |issue=22 |pages=9239–45 |pmid=21973080}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/jm0608614 |title=Slow-Onset, Long-Duration, Alkyl Analogues of Methylphenidate with Enhanced Selectivity for the Dopamine Transporter |year=2007 |last1=Froimowitz |first1=Mark |last2=Gu |first2=Yonghong |last3=Dakin |first3=Les A. |last4=Nagafuji |first4=Pamela M. |last5=Kelley |first5=Charles J. |last6=Parrish |first6=Damon |last7=Deschamps |first7=Jeffrey R. |last8=Janowsky |first8=Aaron |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=219–32 |pmid=17228864}}</ref> In fact, the isobutyl analog of bupropion was also studied by RTI], but [<sup>3</sup>H]DA IC<sub>50</sub> was only 140nM.<ref>http://www.bindingdb.org/data/mols/tenK5030/MolStructure_50302913.html{{dead link|date=March 2013}}{{full|date=March 2013}}</ref>

It can also be readily seen that omission of the hydroxy group in [[Radafaxine]] makes DA and NE IC<sub>50</sub> shift from 630 and 180nM, respectively, to 220 and 130nM, and 5-HT was 387nM.<ref name=morpholine/>

Other analogs of [[desoxy]]-[[Radafaxine]] were also prepared. For example, replacing the ''m''-chloro group with ''m''-fluoro gave an analog that had DA and NE and 5HT IC<sub>50</sub> values of 61, 32, and 4600nM, respectively.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

A somewhat interesting observation is that in the case of [[methcathinone]], the ''m''-chloro group is not needed as the compound is fully active already. However in the case of bupropion where we have a ''tert''-butyl-N group, omission of the ''m''-chloro halogen gave a compound that had diminished activity as a MAT inhibitor.<ref>http://www.bindingdb.org/data/mols/tenK5030/MolStructure_50302912.html{{dead link|date=March 2013}}{{full|date=March 2013}}</ref> Moving the ''m''-chloro to the ''para'' position also led to a deterioration in the compounds resultant potency.<ref>http://www.bindingdb.org/data/mols/tenK5030/MolStructure_50302911.html{{dead link|date=March 2013}}{{full|date=March 2013}}</ref>

==Regulatory history==
[[File:Wellbutrin.jpg|thumb|Wellbutrin XL]]
Bupropion was invented by [[Nariman Mehta]] of Burroughs Wellcome (now [[GlaxoSmithKline]]) in 1969, and the US patent for it was granted in 1974.<ref name="United States Patent: 3819706">{{cite web |url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=3819706.PN.&OS=PN/3819706&RS=PN/3819706 |title=United States Patent 3,819,706: Meta-chloro substituted α-butylamino-propiophenones |author=Mehta NB |date=1974-06-25 |publisher=USPTO |accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref> It was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) as an antidepressant on December 30, 1985, and marketed under the name Wellbutrin.<ref>Wellbutrin Label and Approval History.

In 1997, bupropion was approved by the FDA for use as a smoking cessation aid under the name Zyban.<ref name="NIDA_notes"/> In 2006, Wellbutrin XL was similarly approved as a treatment for [[seasonal affective disorder]].<ref name="wellbutrin_seasonal">Staff Writer.

Brand-name and generic bupropion tablets are available in three formulations, each as the hydrochloride [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]: immediate release (Wellbutrin), [[sustained release]] (Wellbutrin SR), and extended release (Wellbutrin XL or XR). "Sustained release" and "extended release" are generally interchangeable terms, but in this case Wellbutrin SR is intended for twice-daily dosing and Wellbutrin XL is intended for once-daily dosing. Not all generics have retained this naming scheme, and the [[United States Pharmacopeia]] requires all prolonged-release drug formulations (including generics for Wellbutrin SR) to be labeled "extended release", which has caused confusion and medication errors.<ref name="USPnews">{{cite web | title = Practitioner's Reporting News | publisher = [[United States Pharmacopeia]] | date = 2004-09-30 | url=http://www.usp.org/hqi/practitionerPrograms/newsletters/practitionerReportingNews/prn1202004-09-30.html#14 | accessdate = 2007-08-20}} {{Dead link|date=March 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Rosack | first = Jim | title = Company Tries to Clear Up Confusion About Bupropion | journal = Psychiatric News | volume=41 | issue=6 | page=16 | publisher = [[American Psychiatric Association]] | date = 2006-03-17 | url = http://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/Mobile/article.aspx?articleid=109809| accessdate = 2007-08-20}}</ref> According to GlaxoSmithKline, the SR tablets should not be split.<ref>[http://us.gsk.com/products/assets/us_wellbutrinSR.pdf wellbutrin sr sustained-release tablets].

===Recreational use===
According to the US government classification of psychiatric medications, bupropion is "non-abusable".<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK64916/table/A67504/ |chapter=Abuse Potential of Common Psychiatric Medications |title=Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons with HIV/AIDS |series=Treatment Improvement Protocol |location=Rockville |publisher=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |pages=83–4}}</ref>
