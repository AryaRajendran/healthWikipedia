{{Orphan|date=June 2009}}'''EAST syndrome''' is a [[syndrome]] consisting of [[epilepsy|'''E'''pilepsy]], [[Ataxia|'''A'''taxia]] (a [[movement disorder]]), [[Sensorineural hearing loss|'''S'''ensorineural deafness]] ([[deafness]] because of problems with the [[Cochlear nerve|hearing nerve]]) and salt-wasting renal ubulopathy(salt loss caused by [[kidney]] problems). 

EAST syndrome is an [[autosomal recessive]] [[genetic disorder]] caused by mutations in the [[KCNJ10]] [[gene]], as discovered by Bockenhauer and co-workers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bockenhauer D, Feather S, Stanescu HC, ''et al'' |title=Epilepsy, ataxia, sensorineural deafness, tubulopathy, and KCNJ10 mutations |journal=N.

The tubulopathy (renal tubule abnormalities) in this condition predispose to [[hypokalemia|hypokalemic]] (low potassium) [[metabolic alkalosis]] with normal [[blood pressure]]. [[Hypomagnesemia]] (low blood levels of magnesium) may also be present.
