The normal electrical conduction in the heart allows the impulse that is generated by the [[sinoatrial node]] (SA node) of the [[heart]] to be propagated to (and stimulate) the [[myocardium]] ([[Cardiac muscle]]).  The myocardium contracts after stimulation.  It is the ordered stimulation of the myocardium that allows efficient contraction of the heart, thereby allowing [[blood]] to be pumped throughout the body.
==Requirements for effective pumping==

In order to maximize efficiency of contraction and [[cardiac output]], the conduction system of the heart has:

*Substantial [[Atrium (heart)|atrial]] to [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] delay. ''This will allow the atria to completely empty their contents into the ventricles; simultaneous contraction would cause inefficient filling and backflow. The atria are electrically isolated from the ventricles, connected only via the [[AV node]] which briefly delays the signal.''
*Coordinated contraction of ventricular cells. ''The ventricles must maximize [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] pressure to force blood through the circulation, so all the ventricular cells must work together.''
**Ventricular contraction begins at the apex of the heart, progressing upwards to eject blood into the great arteries. ''Contraction that squeezes blood towards the exit is more efficient than a simple squeeze from all directions. Although the ventricular stimulus originates from the AV node in the wall separating the atria and ventricles, the [[Bundle of His]] conducts the signal to the apex.''
**Depolarization propagates through cardiac muscle very rapidly. ''Cells of the ventricles contract nearly simultaneously.''
**The action potentials of cardiac muscle are unusually sustained. ''This prevents premature relaxation, maintaining initial contraction until the entire myocardium has had time to depolarize and contract.''
*Absence of [[tetany (action potential summation)|tetany]]. ''After contracting, the heart must relax to fill up again. Sustained contraction of the heart without relaxation would be fatal, and this is prevented by a temporary'' '''inactivation''' ''of certain ion channels.''

==Electrochemical mechanism==

:''See main article: [[Cardiac action potential]]''
Cardiac muscle has some similarities to neurons and skeletal muscle, as well as important unique properties. Like a neuron, a given myocardial cell has a negative [[membrane potential]] when at rest. Stimulation above a threshold value induces the opening of [[Voltage-gated ion channel|voltage-gated ion channels]] and a flood of [[cations]] into the cell. The positively charged ions entering the cell cause the [[depolarization]] characteristic of an action potential. Like skeletal muscle, depolarization causes the opening of [[voltage-gated calcium channels]]  and release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the [[t-tubules]]. This influx of calcium causes [[calcium-induced calcium release]] from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]], and free Ca<sup>2+</sup> causes [[muscle contraction]]. After a delay, [[Potassium channels]] reopen and the resulting flow of K<sup>+</sup> out of the cell causes [[repolarization]] to the resting state. 

Note that there are important physiological differences between nodal cells and ventricular cells; the specific differences in ion channels and mechanisms of polarization give rise to unique properties of SA node cells, most importantly the spontaneous depolarizations necessary for the SA node's pacemaker activity .

==Conduction pathway==

Signals arising in the [[SA node]] stimulate the atria to contract and travel to the AV node. After a delay, the stimulus is conducted through the [[bundle of His]] to the [[Purkinje fibers]] and the endocardium at the apex of the heart, then finally to the ventricular epicardium.

Microscopically, the wave of depolarization propagates to adjacent cells via [[gap junctions]] located on the [[intercalated disk]]. The heart is a ''functional syncytium'' (not to be confused with a true "syncytium" in which all the cells are fused together, sharing the same plasma membrane as in skeletal muscle). In a functional syncytium, electrical impulses propagate freely between cells in every direction, so that the myocardium functions as a single contractile unit. This property allows rapid, synchronous depolarization of the myocardium. While normally advantageous, this property can be detrimental as it potentially allows the propagation of incorrect electrical signals. These gap junctions can close to isolate damaged or dying tissue, as in a [[myocardial infarction]].

==Depolarization and the ECG==

[[Image:EKG_complex.png|frame|275px|The ECG complex. P=P wave, PR=PR interval, QRS=QRS complex, QT=QT interval, ST=ST segment, T=T wave]]
==SA node: P wave==

Under normal conditions, electrical activity is spontaneously generated by the [[SA node]], the physiological pacemaker.  This electrical impulse is propagated throughout the right [[atrium (anatomy)|atrium]], and through [[Bachmann's bundle]] to the left [[atrium (anatomy)|atrium]], stimulating the [[myocardium]] of the atria to contract.  The conduction of the electrical impulse throughout the atria is seen on the [[ECG]] as the '''P wave'''.

As the electrical activity is spreading throughout the atria, it travels via specialized pathways, known as ''internodal tracts'', from the SA node to the [[AV node]].

==AV node/Bundles: PR interval==

[[Image:Gray501.png|thumb]]
The AV node functions as a critical delay in the conduction system.  Without this delay, the [[atrium (anatomy)|atria]] and [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] would contract at the same time, and blood wouldn't flow effectively from the atria to the ventricles.  The delay in the AV node forms much of the '''PR segment''' on the [[ECG]]. And part of atrial repolarization can be represented by PR segment.

The distal portion of the AV node is known as the [[Bundle of His]].  The Bundle of His splits into two branches in the interventricular septum, the left bundle branch and the right bundle branch.  The left bundle branch activates the [[left ventricle]], while the right bundle branch activates the [[right ventricle]].  The left bundle branch is short, splitting into the left anterior fascicle and the left posterior fascicle.  The left posterior fascicle is relatively short and broad, with dual blood supply, making it particularly resistant to ischemic damage.  The left posterior fascicle transmits impulses to the papillary muscles, leading to mitral valve closure.  As the left posterior fascicle is shorter and broader than the right, impulses reach the papillary muscles just prior to depolarization, and therefore contraction, of the left ventricle myocardium.  This allows pre-tensioning of the chordae tendinae, increasing the resistance to flow through the mitral valve during left ventricular contraction.  This mechanism works in the same manner as pre-tensioning of car seatbelts.

==Purkinje fibers/ventricular myocardium: QRS complex==

The two bundle branches taper out to produce numerous [[Purkinje fibers]], which stimulate individual groups of myocardial cells to contract.

The spread of electrical activity through the ventricular myocardium produces the [[QRS complex]] on the [[ECG]].

==Ventricular repolarization==

The last event of the cycle is the repolarization of the [[ventricle (heart)|ventricles]]. It is the restoring of the resting state. In the ECG, repolarization includes the J wave, ST-segment, and T- and U-waves.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1132522&issueno=3|title=Ventricular repolarization components on the electrocardiogram|first=Yan, Gan-Xin|last=Kowey, P.|accessdate=2013-03-08|}}</ref>

==Pathology==

An impulse ([[action potential]]) that originates from the [[SA node]] at a rate of 60 - 100 beats/minute (bpm) is known as ''normal sinus rhythm''.  If SA nodal impulses occur at a rate less than 60 bpm, the heart rhythm is known as [[sinus bradycardia]].  If SA nodal impulses occur at a rate exceeding 100 bpm, the consequent rapid heart rate is [[sinus tachycardia]]. These conditions are not necessarily bad symptoms, however. Trained athletes, for example, usually show heart rates slower than 60 bpm when not exercising. If the SA node fails to initialize the AV junction can take over as the main pacemaker of the heart. The AV junction "surrounds" the AV node (the AV node is not able to initialize its own impulses) and has a regular rate of 40 to 60 bpm.  These "junctional" rhythms are characterized by a missing or inverted P-Wave.  If both the SA node and the AV junction fail to initialize the electrical impulse, the ventricles can fire the electrical impulses themselves at a rate of 20 to 40 bpm and will have a QRS complex of greater than 120 ms.
