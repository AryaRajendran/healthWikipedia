'''AIDS Services of Austin''' (ASA) is a [[non-profit]] [[AIDS service organization]] that addresses [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] in [[Central Texas]]. Founded in 1987, ASA is the region’s oldest and largest community-based organization addressing the local AIDS crisis. Annually, they provide direct care services to over 1,500 people and HIV prevention education to over 10,000 people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asaustin.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_home |title=About ASA |publisher=AIDS Services of Austin |accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref>

==History==
===1980s===
[[Image:Ann-aids-walk.jpg|thumb|[[Ann Richards]] speaks at the first AIDS Walk Austin in 1988]]
The first HIV case in Austin was reported in the summer of 1983, known at the time as GRID, or [[Gay-Related Immune Deficiency]].  In the first months of the outbreak, there was no local organization dedicated to the quickly growing crisis.  In August 1983, Paul Clover founded the Waterloo Counseling Center to serve the gay community through queer-positive, affordable mental health services.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hivplusmag.com/NewsStory.asp?id=18955&sd=10/06/2008 |title=Counseling Center Marks 25th Anniversary |work=HIVPlusmag.com |date=2008-10-06 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120311113300/http://www.hivplusmag.com/NewsStory.asp?id=18955&sd=10/06/2008 |archivedate=2012-03-11}}</ref> The Austin AIDS Project was started at Waterloo but would grow, in just four years, to the point where an organization dedicated to AIDS was needed.

==== Volunteer Beginnings ====
In 1987 the Austin AIDS Project was incorporated as AIDS Services of Austin. Throughout ASA’s history, volunteers have been instrumental to its growth. One of the volunteer groups formed was the Rubber Fairies, a group which distributed condoms and provided safer sex education. Their efforts garnered praise in an article on Splash Days in a July, 1988 issue of the Advocate, a national news magazine reporting on the LGBT community.

  Another volunteer organization, the Octopus Club,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://octopusclub.org/ |title=Octopus Club}}</ref> was organized by Lew Aldridge in 1987.<ref>{{cite news |last=MacMillan Moser |first=Stephen |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid:770305 |title=After a Fashion |newspaper=[[Austin Chronicle]] |date=2009-04-24}}</ref> The Octopus Club raises funds through events such as ArtErotica, OctoTea Dance and the Oscar Parties for ASA’s Paul Kirby Emergency Relief Fund, named for one of Austin’s earliest AIDS volunteers. Paul started AAP’s first newsletter, helped organize one of the first support groups for people living with HIV and AIDS and was one of ASA’s founding board members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.octopusclub.org/AboutUs/PaulKirbyFund |title=Paul Kirby and the Paul Kirby Fund |publisher=The Octopus Club}}</ref>

==== Early Politics of AIDS ====
In the fall of 1986, the Texas Commissioner of Health proposed quarantining gay men suspected of having HIV and AIDS. [[Glen Maxey]] from the Austin AIDS Project organized medical experts to testify before the Texas Legislature against quarantine. On the day the quarantine proposal was withdrawn, Maxey stepped onto the steps of the Texas Department of Health to a throng of cameras. Interviewed by [[Dan Rather]] for the [[CBS Evening News]], Maxey was outed as a gay activist.<ref>{{cite news |last=MacMillan King |first=Michael |title=Capitol Chronicle: A Profile in Courage |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid%3A83929 |newspaper=[[Austin Chronicle]] |date=2001-12-07}}</ref> He would go on to become the first openly gay legislator in Texas, landing the first state funding earmark for community-based AIDS service organizations.  

===1990s===
In response to the unique legal issues faced by people living with HIV and AIDS, ASA started the Capital Area AIDS Legal Project, or CAALP, in 1990, primarily to provide wills and other life-planning documents. Their objectives have changed with the epidemic, and today CAALP offers a full array of pro bono legal services to people living with HIV and AIDS.  

With the advent of life-prolonging antiretroviral drug therapies, people with HIV were living longer. Pervasive fear of infection remained, but people now needed long-term care and services. Fear and discrimination caused some physicians, especially dentists, to refuse medical and dental treatment to people living with HIV.  In response, in 1992 ASA founded the Jack Sansing Dental Clinic, which still provides quality, affordable dental care. 

==Programs and Services==

=== Helping Hands Food Bank ===

The Food Bank and Nutrition Services empowers people living with HIV and AIDS with the tools to help manage their health through a nutritious diet that is custom tailored to their unique needs.

=== Case Management ===

Case management seeks to assist persons who have difficulty accessing or remaining in primary medical care and for delivering and coordinating HIV and other supportive services. Case management facilitates continuity of care by coordinating client access to an array of services, such as primary medical care, access to health insurance, help with daily living skills, housing, transportation, financial assistance, psychosocial and spiritual support, vocational and educational training and services, mental health programs, substance abuse treatment and legal assistance.

=== HIV Prevention Outreach ===

ASA’s Counseling, Testing, and Referral program allows free access to HIV testing services, behavior change counseling, and linkage to needed community resources.  It is designed to assist individuals in evaluating how their behavior may put them at risk for HIV infection and provide a safe, compassionate, and resource-rich space to discuss challenges and successes in reducing their risk.

=== The Jack Sansing Dental Clinic ===

ASA’s Jack Sansing Dental Clinic provides routine and emergency dental care for people living with HIV and AIDS. This includes oral examination, treatment planning, oral surgery, root canal treatment, periodontal therapy, restorative dentistry, removable prosthodontics, treatment of infection and preventative oral health care. For those with suppressed immune systems due to HIV or AIDS, proper dental care is important to the patient's overall health.

=== Legal Services and the Capital Area AIDS Legal Project ===

ASA’s Legal Services and CAALP provide legal assistance to people living with HIV and AIDS in Central Texas. An in-house attorney responds to many cases in addition to leading The Capital Area AIDS Legal Project, or CAALP, which provides pro bono legal services for low income people who are living with HIV and AIDS.

Through referrals to local volunteer attorneys in the community, CAALP undertakes to assist people with a broad range of civil legal issues, including but not limited to, life planning, insurance, discrimination, confidentiality, immigration, public benefits, landlord-tenant disputes, probate and family law.

=== The Paul Kirby Emergency Relief Fund ===

ASA provides emergency relief for individuals when no other sources of funding exist. The Paul Kirby Emergency Relief Fund is the last resort for case managers to assist clients, with much of the funding going for essentials like food, utilities, rent and prescription medication. The vast majority of the Fund is thanks to the Octopus Club, an all-volunteer, grassroots organization dedicated to making a difference through raising money for the Fund.

=== The PATH Risk Reduction Program ===

Comprehensive Risk & Counseling Services, commonly known as the PATH Program, provides individual and couples counseling to reduce the transmission of HIV. PATH primarily serves people people living with HIV and AIDS, but is also open to HIV- people who report high risk of acquiring the virus. PATH is a harm reduction counseling program, meaning that PATH counselors assess each individual’s readiness for change and clients guide the process by identifying problems and goals to address those problems. 

=== The Q Program === 
The Q is a community center run by gay, bisexual, questioning and transgender men. They help build a stronger and more supportive community by volunteering, hosting social events, and promoting a greater interest in men’s health issues. The program mobilizes young men to shape a healthy community, build positive social connections and support safer sex. Last year, the Q Program reached 1,748 people.

=== Women Rising Project ===
The Project is dedicated to strengthening women through programs and activities that provide education, connection, support, advocacy and peer leadership opportunities. The Project was founded in 1995.

== Annual Events ==

=== Viva ===

Viva, also known as Viva Las Vegas, is an ASA fundraiser that traditionally features faux gambling. In 2009, the event began featuring a fashion show, labeled by [[Austin American-Statesman]] social columnist Michael Barnes as the "Best Austin fashion show ever."<ref>{{cite web |last=Barnes |first=Michael  |url=http://www.austin360.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/outandabout/entries/2009/02/22/viva_las_vegas.html |title=Viva Las Vegas! at the Austin Music Hall |work=Out & About |publisher=Austin360 Blogs |date=2009-02-22}}</ref>

=== AIDS Walk Austin ===

AIDS Walk Austin began as From All Walks of Life in 1988 and is ASA's oldest continuous fundraiser. The [[AIDS Walk]] is a 5k walk through downtown [[Austin, TX]] and includes speeches, music and remembrance. In recent years, it has also featured panels from the [[AIDS Memorial Quilt]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asaustin.org/site/PageNavigator/walk/walk_home |title=Mark Your Calendars for the 26th AIDS Walk |publisher=AIDS Walk Austin}}</ref>
