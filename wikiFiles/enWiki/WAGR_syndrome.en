'''WAGR syndrome''' is a rare genetic [[syndrome]] in which affected children are predisposed to develop [[Wilms' tumour|'''W'''ilms tumour]] (a tumour of the [[kidney]]s), [[aniridia|'''A'''niridia]] (absence of the coloured part of the eye, the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]]), [[Genitourinary system|'''G'''enitourinary]] anomalies, and [[mental retardation|mental '''R'''etardation]].<ref name=Fischbach_2005>{{cite journal | author=Fischbach BV, Trout KL, Lewis J, Luis CA, Sika M | title=WAGR syndrome: a clinical review of 54 cases | journal=Pediatrics | year=2005 | pages=984–8 | volume=116 | issue=4  | pmid=16199712 | doi=10.1542/peds.2004-0467}}</ref>  The '''G''' is sometimes instead given as "gonadoblastoma," since the genitourinary anomalies are tumours of the gonads ([[testis|testes]] or [[ovary|ovaries]]).<ref name=Clericuzio_2004>{{cite book | author = Clericuzio CL | year = 2004 | title = Management of Genetic Syndromes | chapter = WAGR syndrome | editor = Cassidy SB, Allanson JE | edition = 2nd | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-471-30870-6 }}</ref>

A subset of WAGR syndrome patients shows severe [[childhood obesity]]; the acronym '''WAGRO''' (O for obesity) has been used to describe this category.<ref name=OMIM>{{OMIM|194072|WAGR syndrome}}</ref>

The condition results from a [[genetic deletion|deletion]] on [[chromosome 11]] resulting in the loss of several [[genes]]. As such, it is one of the best studied examples of a condition caused by loss of neighbouring (contiguous) genes.<ref name="OMIM"/>

==Synonyms==
WAGR complex, Wilms tumour-aniridia syndrome, aniridia-Wilms tumour syndrome.

==Clinical features and diagnosis==
Newborn children with WAGR syndrome are soon noted to have aniridia. The clinical suspicion for WAGR may be increased with the presence of other genital anomalies, though genitourinary anomalies are not always present, particularly in girls. 

In older children, clinical diagnosis of the syndrome can be made when aniridia and one of the other features are present. While aniridia is rarely absent in WAGR syndrome, cases have been reported without it. Chromosomal analysis is necessary for definitive diagnosis.<ref name=Fischbach_2005 /><ref name=Turleau_1984>{{cite journal |author=Turleau C, de Grouchy J, Nihoul-Fékété C, Dufier J, Chavin-Colin F, Junien C |title=Del11p13/nephroblastoma without aniridia |journal=Hum Genet |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=455–6 |year=1984 |pmid=6092262 |doi=10.1007/BF00291410}}</ref> Other common eye defects include [[cataract]]s and [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]]. About 50% of patients develop Wilms' tumour.

==Treatment==
Children with WAGR syndrome receive regular (3-4 monthly) kidney surveillance for Wilm's tumour until at least the age of 6–8 years and thereafter remain under some follow-up because of the risk of late onset [[nephropathy]] (40% of patients over the age of 12 years). Females with WAGR syndrome may have streak ovaries, which can increase their risk for gonadoblastoma. Malformations of the vagina and/or uterus may also be present.

==Disease mechanism==
WAGR syndrome is caused by a mutation on [[chromosome 11]] in the 11p13 region.<ref name="OMIM"/> Specifically, several genes in this area are deleted, including the [[PAX6]] ocular development gene and the Wilms' tumour gene ([[WT1]]).<ref name=Glaser_1994>{{cite journal |author=Glaser T, Jepeal L, Edwards J, Young S, Favor J, Maas R |title=PAX6 gene dosage effect in a family with congenital cataracts, aniridia, anophthalmia and central nervous system defects |journal=Nat Genet |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=463–71 |year=1994 |pmid=7951315 |doi=10.1038/ng0894-463}}</ref> Abnormalities in [[WT1]] may also cause genitourinary anomalies. Mutations in the PAX6 gene have recently been shown to not only cause ocular abnormalities, but also problems in the brain and pancreas.<ref name=Glaser_1994 /><ref name=Yasuda_2002>{{cite journal |author=Yasuda T, Kajimoto Y, Fujitani Y, Watada H, Yamamoto S, Watarai T, Umayahara Y, Matsuhisa M, Gorogawa S, Kuwayama Y, Tano Y, Yamasaki Y, Hori M |title=PAX6 mutation as a genetic factor common to aniridia and glucose intolerance |journal=Diabetes |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=224–30 |year=2002 |pmid=11756345 |doi=10.2337/diabetes.51.1.224}}</ref><ref name=Mitchell_2003>{{cite journal |author=Mitchell T, Free S, Williamson K, Stevens J, Churchill A, Hanson I, Shorvon S, Moore A, van Heyningen V, Sisodiya S |title=Polymicrogyria and absence of pineal gland due to PAX6 mutation |journal=Ann Neurol |volume=53 |issue=5 |pages=658–63 |year=2003 |pmid=12731001 |doi=10.1002/ana.10576}}</ref><ref name=Talamillo_2003>{{cite journal |author=Talamillo A, Quinn J, Collinson J, Caric D, Price D, West J, Hill R |title=Pax6 regulates regional development and neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex |journal=Dev Biol |volume=255 |issue=1 |pages=151–63 |year=2003 |pmid=12618140 |doi=10.1016/S0012-1606(02)00046-5}}</ref>

The gene for [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF), located on 11p14.1, has been proposed as a candidate gene for the obesity and [[hyperphagia|excessive eating]] in a subset of WAGR patients.<ref name="pmid18753648">{{cite journal |author=Han JC, Liu QR, Jones M, ''et al.'' |title=Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and obesity in the WAGR syndrome |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=359 |issue=9 |pages=918–27 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18753648 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0801119 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=18753648&promo=ONFLNS19 |pmc=2553704}}</ref> This strengthens the case for a role for BDNF in energy [[homeostasis|balance]].

==History==
WAGR syndrome was first described by Miller ''et al.'' in 1964.<ref name=Miller_1964>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM196404302701802 |author=Miller RW, Fraumeni JF, Manning MD |title=Association of Wilms's tumour with aniridia, hemihypertrophy and other congenital malformations |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=270 |issue= 18|pages=922–7 |year=1964 |pmid=14114111}}</ref>
