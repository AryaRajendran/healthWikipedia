'''High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE)''' is a life-threatening form of non-cardiogenic [[pulmonary edema]] (fluid accumulation in the lungs) that occurs in otherwise healthy [[mountaineers]] at altitudes typically above {{Convert|2500|m|ft|sp=us|sigfig=2}}.<ref name=Borden>{{cite book |last1=Roach |first1=James M. |last2=Schoene |first2=Robert B. |editor1-first=Kent B. |editor1-last=Pandolf |editor2-first=Robert E. |editor2-last=Burr |title=Medical Aspects of Harsh Environments |volume=2 |chapter=High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema |location=Borden Institute |place=Washington, DC |year=2002 |pages=789–814 |url=https://ke.army.mil/bordeninstitute/published_volumes/harshEnv2/HE2ch25.pdf |oclc=64437370}}</ref>  Some cases, however, have been reported also at lower altitudes (between {{convert|1500|-|2500|m|ft|disp=or}} in highly vulnerable subjects), although what makes some people susceptible to HAPE is not currently known.  HAPE remains the major cause of death related to high-altitude exposure, with a high mortality rate in the absence of adequate emergency treatment{{POV-statement|date=April 2010}}.

==Symptoms==

Physiological and symptomatic changes often vary according to the altitude involved.<ref>[http://www.altitude.org/home.php Altitude.org | Why do low oxygen levels cause altitude sickness?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The Lake Louise Consensus Definition for High Altitude Pulmonary Edema has set widely-used criteria for defining HAPE symptoms:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Lake Louise Consensus on the Definition of Altitude Illness|work=High Altitude Medicine Guide|publisher=Thomas E. Dietz|accessdate=2012-11-10|url=http://www.high-altitude-medicine.com/AMS-LakeLouise.html}}</ref>

Symptoms: at least two of:
:* Difficulty in breathing ([[dyspnea]]) at rest
:* Cough
:* Weakness or decreased exercise performance
:* Chest tightness or congestion

Signs: at least two of:
:* Crackles or wheezing (while breathing) in at least one lung field
:* Central [[cyanosis]] (blue skin color)
:* [[Tachypnea]] (rapid shallow breathing)
:* [[Tachycardia]] (rapid heart rate)

; Intermediate Altitudes (1500-2500 m or 4900-8200 feet)
Clinical symptoms are unlikely.
Blood oxygen levels remain >90%.

; High Altitude (2500-3500 m or 8200-11500 feet)
Clinical symptoms are common and may develop after 2-3 days. Blood oxygen levels may drop below 90% or lower during exercise. Prior acclimation will decrease the severity of the symptoms.

; Extreme Altitude (>5800 m or 19000 feet)
Blood oxygen levels are <90%, even at rest. Progressive deterioration may occur despite acclimation.

The initial cause of HAPE is a shortage of [[oxygen]] which is caused by the lower air pressure at high altitudes.<ref name=Borden/><ref>{{cite web | author=Kenneth Baillie and Alistair Simpson  | title=Barometric pressure calculator | url=http://www.altitude.org/high_altitude.php | publisher=Apex (Altitude Physiology EXpeditions) | accessdate=2006-08-10}} - Online altitude calculator</ref>
The mechanisms by which this shortage of oxygen causes HAPE are poorly understood, but two processes are believed to be important:
# Increased pulmonary arterial and capillary pressures ([[pulmonary hypertension]]) secondary to [[hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199110313251805 |author=Bärtsch P, Maggiorini M, Ritter M, Noti C, Vock P, Oelz O |title=Prevention of high-altitude pulmonary edema by nifedipine |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=325 |issue=18 |pages=1284–9 |year=1991 |month=October |pmid=1922223}}</ref>
# An [[idiopathic]] non-inflammatory increase in the [[Vascular permeability|permeability]] of the vascular [[endothelium]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Swenson ER, Maggiorini M, Mongovin S, ''et al.'' |title=Pathogenesis of high-altitude pulmonary edema: inflammation is not an etiologic factor |journal=JAMA |volume=287 |issue=17 |pages=2228–35 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=11980523 |doi=10.1001/jama.287.17.2228}}
</ref>

Although higher pulmonary arterial pressures are associated with the development of HAPE, the presence of [[pulmonary hypertension]] may not in itself be sufficient to explain the development of [[edema]]: severe pulmonary hypertension can exist in the absence of clinical HAPE in subjects at high altitude.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maggiorini M, Mélot C, Pierre S, ''et al.'' |title=High-altitude pulmonary edema is initially caused by an increase in capillary pressure |journal=Circulation |volume=103 |issue=16 |pages=2078–83 |year=2001 |month=April |pmid=11319198 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/103/16/2078.long}}</ref>

==Incidence==
The incidence of clinical HAPE in unacclimatized travelers exposed to high altitude (~{{Convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2|disp=or}}) appears to be less than 1%.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The [[United States Army Pike’s Peak Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Pike's Peak Research Laboratory]] has exposed sea-level-resident volunteers rapidly and directly to high altitude; during 30 years of research involving about 300 volunteers (and over 100 staff members), only three have been evacuated with suspected HAPE{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

==Predisposing factors==
Individual susceptibility to HAPE is difficult to predict. The most reliable risk factor is previous susceptibility to HAPE, and there is likely to be a genetic basis to this condition, perhaps involving the gene for [[angiotensin converting enzyme]] (ACE).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Recently, scientists have found the similarities between low amounts of 2,3-BPG (also known as 2,3-DPG) with the occurrence of HAPE at high altitudes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  Persons with sleep apnea are susceptible due to irregular breathing patterns while sleeping at high altitudes.

==Research==
In order to help understand the factors that make some individuals susceptible to HAPE, the International HAPE Database was set up in 2004.<ref>{{cite web | title=International HAPE database  | url=http://www.altitude.org/hape.php | publisher=Apex (Altitude Physiology EXpeditions) | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> Individuals who have previously suffered from HAPE can register with this confidential database in order to help researchers study the condition.
The standard and most important treatment is to descend to lower altitude as quickly as possible, preferably by at least 1000 metres.<ref name=Borden/><ref name="pmid18578641">{{cite journal |author=Luks AM |title=Do we have a 'best practice' for treating high altitude pulmonary edema? |journal=High Altitude Medicine & Biology |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=111–4 |year=2008 |pmid=18578641 |doi=10.1089/ham.2008.1017}}</ref> Oxygen should also be given if possible. Symptoms tend to quickly improve with descent, but more severe symptoms may continue for several days. The standard drug treatments for which there is strong clinical evidence are [[dexamethasone]].<ref name="Maggiorini M, Brunner-La Rocca HP, Peth S, et al. 2006 497–506">{{cite journal |author=Maggiorini M, Brunner-La Rocca HP, Peth S, ''et al.'' |title=Both tadalafil and dexamethasone may reduce the incidence of high-altitude pulmonary edema: a randomized trial |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=145 |issue=7 |pages=497–506 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17015867}}</ref> and [[nifedipine]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bärtsch P, Swenson ER, Maggiorini M |title=Update: High altitude pulmonary edema |journal=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology |volume=502 |issue= |pages=89–106 |year=2001 |pmid=11950158}}</ref> Phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as [[tadalafil]] are also effective<ref name="Maggiorini M, Brunner-La Rocca HP, Peth S, et al. 2006 497–506"/> but may worsen the headache of mountain sickness.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bates MG, Thompson AA, Baillie JK |title=Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in the treatment and prevention of high altitude pulmonary edema |journal=Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=226–31 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17408118}}</ref>
