'''Rasmussen's encephalitis''', also known as ''chronic focal encephalitis'' (CFE), is a rare [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] [[Neurology|neurological]] disease, characterized by frequent and severe [[seizure]]s, loss of [[motor skill]]s and speech, [[hemiparesis]] (paralysis on one side of the body), [[encephalitis]] (inflammation of the brain), and [[dementia]]. The illness affects a single [[cerebral hemisphere]], generally occurs in children under the age of 15.

== Causes and pathophysiology ==
In Rasmussen’s encephalitis, there is [[chronic inflammation]] of the brain, with infiltration of [[T lymphocyte]]s into the brain tissue. This affects only one [[cerebral hemisphere]], either the left or the right. This inflammation causes permanent damage to the cells of the brain, leading to [[atrophy]] of the hemisphere; the epilepsy that this causes may itself contribute to the brain damage.

The cause of the inflammation is not known: infection by a [[virus]] has been suggested, but the evidence for this is inconclusive.<ref name="pmid15689357">{{cite journal |last = Bien |coauthors = Granata, Antozzi |title = Pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of Rasmussen encephalitis: a European consensus statement |journal = Brain |volume = 128 |pages = 454–471 |year = 2005 |doi = 10.1093/brain/awh415 |id = 15689357 |pmid = 15689357 |first1 = CG |issue = Pt 3 |display-authors = 1}}</ref> In the 1990s it was suggested that [[auto-antibodies]] against the glutamate receptor [[GluR3]] were important in causing the disease,<ref name="pmid8036512">{{cite journal |author=Rogers SW |title=Autoantibodies to glutamate receptor GluR3 in Rasmussen's encephalitis |journal=Science |volume=265 |issue=5172 |pages=648–51 |year=1994 |pmid=8036512 |doi=10.1126/science.8036512 |author-separator=, |author2=Andrews PI |author3=Gahring LC |display-authors=3 |last4=Whisenand |first4=T |last5=Cauley |first5=K |last6=Crain |first6=B |last7=Hughes |first7=T. |last8=Heinemann |first8=S. |last9=McNamara |first9=J.}}</ref> but this is no longer thought to be the case.<ref name="pmid15249609">{{cite journal |author=Watson R |title=Absence of antibodies to glutamate receptor type 3 (GluR3) in Rasmussen encephalitis |journal=Neurology |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=43–50 |year=2004 |pmid=15249609 |author-separator=, |author2=Jiang Y |author3=Bermudez I |display-authors=3 |last4=Houlihan |first4=L |last5=Clover |first5=L |last6=McKnight |first6=K |last7=Cross |first7=JH |last8=Hart |first8=IK |last9=Roubertie |first9=A |doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000132651.66689.0F}}</ref> However, more recent studies report the '''presence of autoantibodies against the NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluRepsilon2 (anti-NR2A antibodies)''' in a subset of patients with Rasmussen's encephalitis.<ref name="pmid15987271">{{cite journal |author=Takahashi Y |title=Autoantibodies and cell-mediated autoimmunity to NMDA-type GluRepsilon2 in patients with Rasmussen's encephalitis (RE) and chronic progressive epilepsia partialis continua |journal=Epilepsia |volume=46 |issue=Suppl 5 |pages=152–158 |year=2005 |pmid=15987271 |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2005.01024.x |author-separator=, |author2=Mori H |author3=Mishina M |display-authors=3 |last4=Watanabe |first4=Masahiko |last5=Kondo |first5=Naomi |last6=Shimomura |first6=Jiro |last7=Kubota |first7=Yuko |last8=Matsuda |first8=Kazumi |last9=Fukushima |first9=Katsuyuki}}</ref> There has also been some evidence that patients suffering from RE express auto-antibodies against alpha 7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=R|coauthors=Jepson, JE; Bermudez, I; Alexander, S; Hart, Y; McKnight, K; Roubertie, A; Fecto, F; Valmier, J; Sattelle, DB; Beeson, D; Vincent, A; Lang, B|title=Alpha7-acetylcholine receptor antibodies in two patients with Rasmussen encephalitis.|journal=Neurology|date=2005 Dec 13|volume=65|issue=11|pages=1802–4|pmid=16344526}}</ref>

<!-- None of the "causes" proposed explains why the disease only affects one hemisphere of the brain. -->

==Clinical features==
The condition mostly affects children, with an average age of 6 years. However, one in ten people with the condition develops it in adulthood.

There are two main stages, sometimes preceded by a 'prodromal stage' of a few months. In the ''acute stage'', lasting four to eight months, the inflammation is active and the symptoms become progressively worse. These include weakness of one side of the body ([[hemiparesis]]), loss of vision for one side of the [[visual field]] ([[hemianopia]]), and cognitive difficulties (affecting learning, memory or language, for example). Epileptic [[seizure]]s are also a major part of the illness, although these are often [[Seizure_types#Partial_seizures|partial]]. Focal motor seizures or [[epilepsia partialis continua]] are particularly common, and may be very difficult to control with drugs.

In the chronic or ''residual stage'', the inflammation is no longer active, but the sufferer is left with some or all of the symptoms because of the damage that the inflammation has caused. In the long term, most patients are left with some epilepsy, paralysis and cognitive problems, but the severity varies considerably.<ref name="pmid15689357"/>

==Investigations==

The diagnosis may be made on the clinical features alone, along with tests to rule out other possible causes. An [[EEG]] will usually show the electrical features of epilepsy and slowing of brain activity in the affected hemisphere,{{fact|date=April 2013}} and [[MRI]] brain scans will show gradual shrinkage of the affected hemisphere with signs of inflammation or scarring.{{fact|date=April 2013}} [[Brain biopsy]] can provide very strong confirmation of the diagnosis, but this is not always necessary.{{fact|date=April 2013}}

==Treatment==
During the acute stage, treatment is aimed at reducing the inflammation. As in other inflammatory diseases, [[steroids]] may be used first of all, either as a short course of high-dose treatment, or in a lower dose for long-term treatment. [[Intravenous immunoglobulin]] is also effective both in the short term and in the long term, particularly in adults where it has been proposed as first-line treatment.<ref>{{Cite journal |last = Hart |coauthors = Cortez, Andermann, Hwang, Fish |title = Medical treatment of Rasmussen syndrome (chronic encephalitis and epilepsy): effect of high-dose steroids or immunoglobulins in 19 patients |journal = Neurology |volume = 44 |pages = 1030–1036 |year = 1994 |id = 8208394 |pmid = 8208394 |first1 = YM |issue = 6 |doi = 10.1212/WNL.44.6.1030}}</ref> Other similar treatments include [[plasmapheresis]] and [[tacrolimus]], though there is less evidence for these. None of these treatments can prevent permanent disability from developing.

During the residual stage of the illness when there is no longer active inflammation, treatment is aimed at improving the remaining symptoms. Standard anti-epileptic drugs are usually ineffective in controlling seizures, and it may be necessary to surgically remove or disconnect the affected cerebral hemisphere, in an operation called [[hemispherectomy]]. This usually results in further weakness, [[hemianopsia]] and cognitive problems, but the other side of the brain may be able to take over some of the function, particularly in young children. The operation may not be advisable if the left hemisphere is affected, since this hemisphere contains most of the parts of the brain that control language. However, hemispherectomy is often very effective in reducing seizures.<ref name="pmid15689357"/>

==Name of the disease==
It is named for the [[neurosurgeon]] Theodore Rasmussen (1910–2002), who succeeded [[Wilder Penfield]] as head of the Montreal Neurological Institute, and served as Neurosurgeon-in-Chief at the Royal Victoria Hospital.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2828}}</ref><ref name="pmid13566382">{{cite journal |author=Rasmussen T, Olszewski J, Lloyd-Smith D |title=Focal seizures due to chronic localized encephalitis |journal=Neurology |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=435–45 |year=1958 |pmid=13566382 |doi=10.1212/WNL.8.6.435}}</ref>

==Foundations==
The [[Hemispherectomy Foundation]] was formed in 2008 to assist families with children who have Rasmussen's Encephalitis and other conditions that require hemispherectomy.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Community News|url=http://www.community-news.com/node/3302|  accessdate=2009-02-25}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

[http://rechildrens.com/ The RE Children's Project] was founded in 2010 to increase awareness of Rasmussen's Encephalitis.  Its primary purpose is to support scientific research directed toward finding a cure for this disease.
