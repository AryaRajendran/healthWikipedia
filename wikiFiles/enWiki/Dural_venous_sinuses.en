The '''dural venous sinuses''' (also called '''dural sinuses''', '''cerebral sinuses''', or '''cranial sinuses''') are [[vein|venous]] channels found between layers of [[dura mater]] in the [[brain]].<ref>{{cite book | first=John A. | last=Kiernan | year=2005 | title=Barr's The Human Nervous System: An Anatomical Viewpoint | pages=428–230 | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | isbn=0-7817-5154-3 | url=http://www.lww.com/product/?0-7817-5154-3 }}</ref> They receive [[blood]] from internal and external [[vein]]s of the brain, receive [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) from the [[subarachnoid space]], and ultimately empty into the [[internal jugular vein]].

==Structure==
The walls of the dural venous sinuses are composed of [[dura mater]] lined with [[endothelium]], a specialized layer of [[squamous cell|flattened cells]] found in [[blood vessel]]s. They differ from other blood vessels in that they lack a full set of vessel layers (e.g. [[tunica media]]) characteristic of [[artery|arteries]] and [[vein]]s. It also lacks valves as seen in veins.

==Clinical relevance==
The sinuses can be injured by trauma.<ref>{{MUNAnatomy|head/cbv}}</ref> Damage to the [[dura mater]], which may be caused by skull fracture, may result in [[thrombosis|blood clot]] formation (thrombosis) within the dural sinuses. While rare, [[dural sinus thrombosis]] may lead to [[hemorrhage|hemorrhagic]] [[infarction]] with serious consequences including [[epilepsy]], neurological deficits, or death.<ref>{{cite journal | author=de Bruijn SF, Stam J | title=Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of anticoagulant treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin for cerebral sinus thrombosis | journal=Stroke | year=1999 | pages=484–8 | volume=30 | issue=3  | pmid=10066840}}</ref>
