==History==
In the mid-1980s, it was believed that [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]'s then-new hospital prospective payment system using [[diagnosis-related group]]s may have led to hospitals' discharging patients to post-hospital care (e.g., [[Nursing home|skilled nursing facilities]]) more quickly than appropriate in order to save money.<ref name="Neu-1986">{{Cite web|url= http://www.rand.org/pubs/reports/2009/R3335.pdf |title= Extending the Medicare prospective payment system to posthospital care.

==Advantages==
Advocates of bundled payments note:
* Unlike fee-for-service, bundled payment discourages unnecessary care, encourages coordination across providers, and potentially improves quality.<ref name="Miller-2009"/>
* Unlike capitation, bundled payment does not penalize providers for caring for sicker patients.<ref name="Miller-2009"/>
* Considering the advantages and disadvantages of fee-for-service, [[Pay for performance (healthcare)|pay for performance]], bundled payment for episodes of care, and global payment such as capitation, Mechanic and Altman concluded that "episode payments are the most immediately viable approach."<ref name="Mechanic-2009">{{Cite journal| author = Mechanic RE, Altman SH | title = Payment reform options: episode payment is a good place to start | journal = Health Aff (Millwood) | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = w262-71 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.28.2.w262 | url = http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/28/2/w262 | pmid = 19174388 }}</ref>

* Bundling payment provides additional advantages to providers and patients alike, through removing inefficiency and redundancy from patient-care protocols; e.g. duplicate testing, delivering unnecessary care, and failing to adequately provide postoperative care.
* This method of payment can also provide transparency for consumers by fixing pricing and publishing cost and outcomes data. Patients would be able to choose a provider based on a comparison of real data, not word of mouth.
* Bundled payments may also encougage economies of scale - especially if providers agree to use a single product or type of medical supply - as hospitals or integrated health systems can often negotiate better prices if they purchase supplies in bulk.<ref>[http://www.physicianspractice.com/physician-compensation/bundled-payments-what-physicians-need-know "Bundled Payments: What Physicians Need to Know"] Shelly K. Schwartz, Physicians Practice, November 2012.</ref>
==Considerations==
Before practices choose to participate in bundled payments, they need to be diligent in researching potential episodes of care that would be amenable to this type of reimbursement. Once they have selected and defined an episode of care, they should:
* Identify all associated costs,
* List all services provided within the episode of care,
* Calculate how the care episode would be reimbursed, and
* Identify how many entities would share in reimbursement.<ref>[http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/publications/news/news-now/payment-special-report/20120921specrpt-paymentmodels.html "Taming Payment and Delivery Model Monsters"] Sheri Porter, AAFP News, September 2012.</ref>

==Disadvantages==
The drawbacks of a bundled payment approach include:
* The scientific evidence in support of it has been described as "scant."<ref name="MA-2009a"/> For example, RAND concluded that its effect on health outcomes is "uncertain."<ref name="RAND"/>
* It does not discourage unnecessary episodes of care;<ref name="Miller-2009"/> for example, physicians might hospitalize some patients unnecessarily.<ref name="MedPAC-2008"/>
* Providers may seek to maximize profit by avoiding patients for whom reimbursement may be inadequate (e.g., patients who do not take their drugs as prescribed), by overstating the severity of an illness, by giving the lowest level of service possible, by not diagnosing complications of a treatment before the end date of the bundled payment, or by delaying post-hospital care until after the end date of the bundled payment.<ref name="Satin-2009"/><ref name="MedPAC-2008"/>
* Hospitals may seek to maximize profit by limiting access to specialists during an inpatient stay.<ref name="Galewitz-2009"/>
* Because one provider may [[Outsourcing|outsource]] part of the care of a patient to other providers, it may be difficult to assign financial accountability for a given bundled payment.<ref name="Satin-2009"/>
* There is an administrative and operational burden, for example in establishing fair compensation rates.<ref name="Satin-2009"/><ref name="RAND"/> Small sample sizes and incomplete data may cause difficulties in calculation of proper rates for bundled payments.<ref name="Robinson-2009">{{Cite journal| author = Robinson JC, Williams T, Yanagihara D | title = Measurement of and reward for efficiency in California's pay-for-performance program.
