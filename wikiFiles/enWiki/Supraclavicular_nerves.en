The '''supraclavicular nerves''' (descending branches) arise from the third and fourth [[cervical nerves]]; they emerge beneath the posterior border of the [[Sternocleidomastoideus]], and descend in the [[posterior triangle of the neck]] beneath the [[platysma]] and [[deep cervical fascia]].

==Branches==
Near the clavicle they perforate the fascia and Platysma to become cutaneous, and are arranged, according to their position, into three groups—anterior, middle and posterior.

===Medial supraclavicular nerve===
The '''medial supraclavicular nerves''' or ''anterior supraclavicular nerves'' (nn. supraclaviculares anteriores; suprasternal nerves) cross obliquely over the [[external jugular vein]] and the clavicular and sternal heads of the [[sternocleidomastoideus]], and supply the skin as far as the middle line. They furnish one or two filaments to the [[sternoclavicular joint]].

===Intermedial supraclavicular nerve===
The '''intermedial supraclavicular nerve''' ''middle supraclavicular nerves'' (nn. supraclaviculares medii; supraclavicular nerves) cross the [[clavicle]], and supply the skin over the [[pectoralis major]] and [[deltoideus]], communicating with the cutaneous branches of the [[upper intercostal nerves]].

===Lateral supraclavicular nerve=== <!--Lateral supraclavicular nerve redirects here-->
The '''lateral supraclavicular nerve''' or ''posterior supraclavicular nerves''<ref>[http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Posterior_supraclavicular_nerve Biology-online]</ref>(nn. supraclaviculares posteriores; supra-acromial nerves) pass obliquely across the outer surface of the [[trapezius]] and the [[acromion]], and supply the skin of the upper and posterior parts of the [[shoulder]].
