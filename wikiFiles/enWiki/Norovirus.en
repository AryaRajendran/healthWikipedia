Norovirus infection is characterized by nausea, forceful vomiting, watery diarrhoea, and abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headache, coughs, and low-grade fever may occur. The disease is usually self-limiting, and severe illness is rare. The virus affects around 267 million people and causes over 200,000 deaths each year; these deaths are usually in less developed countries and in the very young, elderly and immuno-suppressed.<ref>Debbink K, Lindesmith LC, Donaldson EF, Baric RS (2012) Norovirus Immunity and the Great Escape.

'''Winter vomiting bug''' is a common term for noroviruses in the UK, because the virus tends to cause vomiting and to spread more easily in winter, when people tend to spend more time indoors and near to each other.<ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Norovirus/Pages/Introduction.aspx "NHS public information"]</ref>

=== Transmission ===
Noroviruses are transmitted directly from person to person and indirectly via contaminated water and food. They are extremely contagious, and fewer than twenty virus particles can cause an infection.<ref name="pmid21876931">{{cite journal |author=Morillo SG, Timenetsky Mdo C |title=Norovirus: an overview |journal=Revista Da Associação Médica Brasileira (1992) |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=453–8 |year=2011 |month=August |pmid=21876931 |doi= |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0104-42302011000400023&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en}}</ref> Transmission occurs through ingesting contaminated food and water and by person-to-person spread.

Vomiting, in particular, transmits infection effectively. In one incident, a person who vomited spread infection right across a restaurant, suggesting that many unexplained cases of food poisoning may have their source in vomit. 126 people were dining at six tables in December 1998; one woman vomited. Staff quickly cleaned up, and people continued eating. Three days later others started falling ill; 52 people reported a range of symptoms, from fever and nausea to vomiting and diarrhea. The cause was not immediately identified. Researchers plotted the seating arrangement: more than 90% of the people at the same table as the sick woman later reported becoming ill. There was a direct correlation between the risk of infection of people at other tables and how close they were to the sick woman. More than 70% of the diners at an adjacent table fell ill; at a table on the other side of the restaurant, the rate was still 25%. The outbreak was attributed to a Norwalk-like virus (norovirus). Other cases of transmission by vomit were later identified.

In one outbreak at an international scout jamboree in the Netherlands, each person with gastroenteritis infected an average of 14 people before increased hygiene measures were put in place. Even after these new measures were enacted, an ill person still infected an average of 2.1 other people.<ref>{{cite journal

Noroviruses commonly isolated in cases of acute gastroenteritis belong to two genogroups: genogroup I (GI) includes Norwalk virus, Desert Shield virus and Southampton virus; and II (GII), which includes Bristol virus, Lordsdale virus, Toronto virus, Mexico virus, Hawaii virus and Snow Mountain virus.<ref name=health/>

Noroviruses can genetically be classified into five different genogroups (GI, GII, GIII, GIV, and GV), which can be further divided into different genetic clusters or [[genotype]]s. For example, genogroup II, the most prevalent human genogroup, presently contains 19 genotypes. Genogroups I, II and IV infect humans, whereas genogroup III infects [[Bovinae|bovine species]], and genogroup V has recently been isolated in mice.<ref name="pmid17953996">{{cite journal

A 2010 study suggested a specific genetic version of norovirus (which would not be distinguishable from other types of the virus using standard viral antibody tests) interacts with a specific mutation in the [[ATG16L1]] gene to help trigger symptomatic [[Crohn's disease]] in mice that have been subjected to a chemical that causes intestinal injury similar to the process in humans. (There are other similar ways for such diseases to happen like this, and this study in itself does not prove norovirus causes Crohn's in humans).

== Pathophysiology ==
When a person becomes infected with norovirus, the virus begins to [[Viral replication|replicate]] within the [[small intestine]]. After approximately one to two days, norovirus infection symptoms can appear. The principal symptom is acute [[gastroenteritis]] that develops between 24 and 48 hours after exposure, and lasts for 24–60 hours.<ref name="cdcfactsheet"/> The disease is usually [[self-limiting (biology)|self-limiting]], and characterized by nausea, forceful vomiting, watery [[diarrhea]], and abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headache, coughs, and low-grade fever may occur.

Severe illness is rare; although people are frequently treated at the emergency ward, they are rarely admitted to the [[hospital]]. The number of deaths from norovirus in the United States is estimated to be around 300 each year, with most of these occurring in the very young, the elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems. Symptoms may become life-threatening in these groups if [[dehydration]] is ignored or not treated.<ref name="pmid16968608"/>

== Prevention ==
Hand washing with soap and water is an effective method for reducing the transmission of norovirus [[pathogen]]s. Alcohol rubs (≥62% ethanol) may be used as an adjunct, but are less effective than hand-washing, as norovirus lacks a [[lipid]] [[viral envelope]].<ref name="pmid16765204" /> Surfaces where norovirus particles may be present can be sanitised with a solution of 1.5% to 7.5% of household bleach in water, or other disinfectants effective against norovirus.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/gastro/norovirus-factsheet.htm</ref><ref>http://www.epa.gov/oppad001/list_g_norovirus.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/interviews/interview/838/</ref>

In health-care environments, the prevention of [[nosocomial infection]]s involves routine and [[terminal cleaning]]. [[Nonflammable alcohol vapor in CO2|Nonflammable alcohol vapor in CO<sub>2</sub>]] systems are used in health care environments where medical electronics would be adversely affected by aerosolized chlorine or other caustic compounds.<ref name="pmid10833336">{{cite journal

Epidemiological data from developing countries about the importance of norovirus in pediatric diarrhea are limited. Recently, in Nicaragua, it has been observed that norovirus is responsible for 11% of the diarrhea cases occurring in children less than five years of age at community level and 15% of the moderate to severe cases requiring intravenous rehydration.<ref>Bucardo F, Nordgren J, Carlsson B, Paniagua M, Lindgren PE, Espinoza F, Svensson L., "Pediatric norovirus diarrhea in Nicaragua", ''J.

== History ==
The norovirus was originally named the "Norwalk agent" after [[Norwalk, Ohio]], in the United States, where an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis occurred among children at Bronson [[Elementary School]] in November 1968. In 1972, electron microscopy on stored [[Human feces|human stool]] samples identified a virus, which was given the name "[[Norwalk virus]]." Numerous outbreaks with similar symptoms have been reported since. The [[cloning]] and [[sequencing]] of the Norwalk virus genome showed that these viruses have a genomic organization consistent with viruses belonging to the family [[Caliciviridae]].<ref name="pmid9015097">{{cite journal

|doi=
}}</ref> The name was shortened to "''norovirus''" after being identified in a number of outbreaks on [[cruise ship]]s and receiving attention throughout the United States. The name "norovirus" (''Norovirus'' for the genus) was approved by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) in 2002.<ref>ICTVdB Management (2006). 00.012.0.03. Norovirus.

}}</ref> were published by ICTV, which strongly encourage the media, national health authorities and the scientific community to use the virus name [[Norwalk virus]], rather than the genus name Norovirus, when referring to outbreaks of the disease. This is also a public statement of ICTV to the request from an individual in Japan to rename the Norovirus genus because of the possibility of negative associations for people in Japan and elsewhere who have the family name "Noro". Before this position of ICTV was made public, ICTV consulted widely with members of the Caliciviridae Study Group and carefully discussed the case.

In addition to "Norwalk agent" and "Norwalk virus," the virus previously has been called "Norwalk-like virus," "small, round-structured viruses" (SRSVs), and "Snow Mountain virus."<ref name="pmid3036438">{{cite journal
