An '''altered level of consciousness''' is any measure of arousal other than normal.  '''Level of consciousness''' ('''LOC''') is a measurement of a person's [[arousal|arousability]] and responsiveness to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] from the environment.<ref name="Kandel00">

==Definition==
Scales and terms to classify the levels of consciousness differ, but in general, reduction in response to stimuli indicates an altered level of consciousness:

|-
! [[Confused]]
|Disoriented; impaired thinking and responses
| People who do not respond quickly with information about their name, location, and the time are considered "obtuse" or "[[confusion|confused]]".<ref name="Kruse86"/>  A confused person may be bewildered, disoriented, and have difficulty following instructions.<ref name="Tindall90"/>  The person may have slow thinking and possible memory time loss.  This could be caused by sleep deprivation, malnutrition, allergies, environmental pollution, drugs (prescription and nonprescription), and infection.  
|-
![[Delirium|Delirious]]
|Disoriented; restlessness, hallucinations, sometimes delusions
|Some scales have "delirious" below this level, in which a person may be restless or agitated and exhibit a marked deficit in [[attention]].<ref name="Porth07"/>  
|-
![[somnolence|Somnolent]]
| Sleepy
| A ''[[somnolence|somnolent]]''<!--obtunded--> person shows excessive [[drowsiness]] and responds to stimuli only with incoherent mumbles or disorganized movements.<ref name="Kruse86"/>
|-
![[Obtunded]]
|Decreased alertness; slowed psychomotor responses
| In ''[[obtundation]]'', a person has a decreased interest in their surroundings, slowed responses, and sleepiness.<ref name="Tindall90"/>

===Glasgow Coma Scale===
{{Main|Glasgow Coma Scale}}
The most commonly used tool for measuring LOC objectively is the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] (GCS).  It has come into almost universal use for assessing people with [[Acquired brain injury|brain injury]],<ref name="Porth07">{{cite book |author=Porth C |title=Essentials of Pahtophysiology: Concepts of Altered Health States |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2007 |pages=835 |isbn=0-7817-7087-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2008-07-03 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=57RQC-3OPtUC&pg=PT858&dq=%22level+of+consciousness%22}}</ref> or an altered level of consciousness. Verbal, motor, and eye-opening responses to stimuli are measured, scored, and added into a final score on a scale of 3â€“15, with a lower score being a more decreased level of consciousness.

===Others===
The [[AVPU]] scale is another means of measuring LOC: people are assessed to determine whether they are '''a'''lert, responsive to '''v'''erbal stimuli, responsive to '''p'''ainful stimuli, or '''u'''nresponsive.<ref name="Pollak02"/><ref name="Forgey99"/>  To determine responsiveness to voice, a caregiver speaks to, or, failing that, yells at the person.<ref name="Pollak02"/>  Responsiveness to pain is determined with a mild painful stimulus such as a pinch; moaning or withdrawal from the stimulus is considered a response to pain.<ref name="Pollak02"/>  The ACDU scale, like AVPU, is easier to use than the GCS and produces similarly accurate results.<ref name="Posner07">{{cite book |author= Posner JB, Saper CB, Schiff ND, Plum F |title=Plum and Posner's Diagnosis of Stupor and Coma |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |location= |year=2007 |pages=41 |isbn=0-19-532131-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Using ACDU, a patient is assessed for '''a'''lertness, '''c'''onfusion, '''d'''rowsiness, and '''u'''nresponsiveness.<ref name="Posner07"/>

The [[Grady Coma Scale]] classes people on a scale of I to V along a scale of confusion, stupor, deep stupor, [[abnormal posturing]], and coma.<ref name="Tindall90"/>

==Differential diagnosis==
A lowered level of consciousness indicate a deficit in brain function.<ref name="Porth071" />  Level of consciousness can be lowered when the brain receives insufficient oxygen (as occurs in [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]); insufficient blood (as occurs in [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]); or has an alteration in the [[brain chemistry|brain's chemistry]].<ref name="Pollak02">{{cite book |author= Pollak AN, Gupton CL |title=Emergency Care and Transportation of the Sick and Injured |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |location=Boston |year=2002 |pages=140 |isbn=0-7637-1666-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2008-07-04 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=xAPuKkKA6FEC&pg=PT177&dq=%22level+of+consciousness%22}}</ref>  [[Metabolic disorder]]s such as [[diabetes mellitus]] and [[uremia]] can alter consciousness.<ref name="Dohert05"/>  [[hyponatremia|Hypo-]] or [[hypernatremia]] (decreased and elevated levels of [[sodium]], respectively) as well as [[dehydration]] can also produce an altered LOC.<ref name="Johnson98">

Increases in [[intracranial pressure]] (the pressure within the skull) can also cause altered LOC.  It can result from [[traumatic brain injury]] such as [[concussion]].<ref name="Dohert05"/>   [[Stroke]] and [[intracranial hemorrhage]] are other causes.<ref name="Dohert05"/> [[Infection]]s of the [[central nervous system]] may also be associated with decreased LOC; for example, an altered LOC is the most common symptom of [[encephalitis]].<ref name="Scheld04">

A [[concussion]], which is a mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) may result in decreased LOC.

==Pathophysiology==
Although the neural science behind alertness, wakefulness, and arousal are not fully known, the [[reticular formation]] is known to play a role in these.<ref name="Tindall90"/>  The [[ascending reticular activating system]] is a postulated group of neural connections that receives sensory input and projects to the [[cerebral cortex]] through the [[midbrain]] and [[thalamus]] from the retucular formation.<ref name="Tindall90"/> Since this system is thought to modulate wakefulness and sleep, interference with it, such as injury, illness, or metabolic disturbances, could alter the level of consciousness.<ref name="Tindall90"/>   

Normally, stupor and coma are produced by interference with the [[brain stem]], such as can be caused by a [[lesion]] or indirect effects, such as [[brain herniation]].<ref name="Tindall90"/>  Mass lesions in the brain stem normally cause coma due to their effects on the reticular formation.<ref name="Tindall901">

</ref> Mass [[lesion]]s that occur [[supratentorial|above]] the [[tentorium cerebelli]] (pictured) normally do not significantly alter the level of consciousness unless they are very large or affect both [[cerebral hemisphere]]s.<ref name="Tindall90"/>

</ref>  Speed and accuracy of responses to questions and reactions to stimuli such as touch and pain are noted.<ref name="Dohert05"/>  [[Reflex]]es, such as the [[coughing|cough]] and gag reflexes, are also means of judging LOC.<ref name="Dohert05"/>  Once the level of consciousness is determined, clinicians seek clues for the cause of any alteration.<ref name="Tindall90"/> Usually the first tests in the ER are pulse oximetry to determine if there is hypoxia, serum glucose levels to rule out hypoglycemia. A urine drug screen may be sent. A CT head is very important to obtain to rule out bleed. In case, meningitis is suspected, a lumbar puncture must be performed. A serum TSH is an important test to order. In select groups consider vitamin B12 levels. Checking serum ammonia is not advised.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the degree of decrease in consciousness and its underlying cause.  Initial treatment often involves the administration of [[dextrose]] if the blood sugar is low as well as the administration of [[naloxone]] and [[thiamine]].
