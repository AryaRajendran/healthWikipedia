'''Erotic electrostimulation''' (abbreviated '''e-stim'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2009/nov/17/erotic-electricity/ |title=Erotic electricity |publisher=Las Vegas Weekly |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}</ref> and also known as '''electrosex''') is a [[human sexual practice]] involving the application of [[electricity|electrical]] stimulation to the [[nerve]]s of the body, with particular emphasis on the [[genitals]], using a power source (such as a [[TENS]], [[Electrical muscle stimulation|EMS]], [[Violet wand]], or made-for-play units) for purposes of [[sexual stimulation]]. Electrostimulation has been associated with [[BDSM]] activities, and erotic electrostimulation is an evolution of that practice. Erotic electrostimulation is the use of electrostimulation in an erotic or sexual manner versus the more sadistic or painful applications in [[BDSM]].

==Safety==
Electrostimulation, in general, can cause [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] damage or even [[death]] if misused.<ref name="Juice">{{Cite book|last= Abdul |first= Uncle |title= Juice: Electricity for Pleasure and Pain |year= 1998 |publisher= Greenery Press |location=San Francisco |isbn= 1-890159-06-9}}</ref> The most common problems arising from electrostimulation tend to be [[burn]]s from lack of [[lubrication]] or [[electric insulation|bad contact]] between the electrode and the skin's surface. Even at relatively low [[Electric current|current]] and [[voltage]], there is also risk of interference with normal heart function (potentially including [[cardiac arrest]]), and this risk is higher for those who use an [[artificial pacemaker]] or similar device or who have heart conditions. Because of this, it is not advisable to place the electrical contacts in such a way that current passes through the  [[thoracic cavity|chest cavity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/fundamentals/rehabilitation/treatment_of_pain_and_inflammation.html |title=Treatment of Pain and Inflammation: Rehabilitation: Merck Manual Home Edition |publisher=Merckmanuals.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}</ref>  Newcomers are encouraged to research the hazards, limitations, and techniques of electrostimulation and the devices used.

==History==
The use of electricity for entertainment purposes dates back at least as early as the 1740s.  In the 1830s, insertable electrode attachments for small magnetos could be purchased.  Later in the 1800s, various electric belts (some complete with "suspensory sack") were advertised as cures for impotence.<ref name="Essig">{{Cite book|last= Essig |first= Mark |title= Edison & The Electric Chair|page=43 |year= 2003 |isbn= 0-8027-1406-4}}</ref> In the 1920s, the [[American Medical Association]] investigated such devices, and concluded that they provided "more or less mechanical masturbation".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Body Electric: How Strange Machines Built the Modern American |last=de la Pe√±a |first=Carolyn Thomas |year=2005 |publisher=NYU Press |location=New York |isbn=0-8147-1983-X |page=169 |accessdate=July 6, 2012 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MxU8Rf1pKTgC&pg=PA153&dq=electric+masturbation#v=onepage&q=electric%20masturbation&f=false}}</ref>

Modern{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} electrostimulation first became recognized during the 1950s with the introduction of a device called the ''Relaxacisor'',{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} which was originally designed to stimulate the muscles of a [[Relaxation technique|relaxing]] subject using electric currents as a means of "passive [[exercise]]". Such power sources{{Dubious|date=September 2010}}<!-- the Relaxacisor was banned by the FDA--> are still in medical use today and are known as EMS ([[electrical muscle stimulation]]) units. Some people soon found alternative uses for the Relaxacisors by placing the contacts on sexual parts of the body.

By the 1970s, medical TENS ([[transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]]) units were also being used for electrostimulation. In the 1980s the first devices manufactured specifically for erotic electrostimulation became available, in particular the Titillator and the Pleasure Box, later known as the PES Power Box.

In the 1970s, experimenters noticed that bare speaker wires could deliver a jolt and began using recorded and live sound for electrostimulation. At that time, there were no professionally made attachments for such play, so people built their own out of copper plumbing parts and other metal pieces with attention to [[resistor]]s placed in series with the human parts to control the current for safety.  Although early e-stim units used only a simple, [[pulse wave|pulsed]], [[sinusoidal wave]], newer units (such as the ErosTek 312) use more complex [[wave form]]s and also allow for the use of ambient sound or prerecorded wave forms like music or specially designed computer files for specific types of stimulation. There are now sites dedicated to the creation of [[MP3]] files specifically for erotic journeys or symphonies, which can include such routines as rewards, punishments, very strong, and pleasantly soft portions.

Research into general electrode massage units, using [[accupuncture]] points, has come up with the point SP6<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acupuncture.com/education/points/spleen/sp6.htm |title=Acupuncture Points - Spleen SP 6 |publisher=Acupuncture.Com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}</ref> (spleen 6) as a key point likely to stimulate a woman to orgasm, electronically.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/76521123/Guide-to-the-Female-Electro-Orgasm |title=Guide to the Female Electro Orgasm |publisher=Docstoc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}</ref>

==Types of power sources==

===Medical power sources===
[[File:Electric Stimulation.jpg|thumb|thumb|right|Electrostimulation of a penis using metallic loops and electronic acupuncture treatment device]]

There are repackaged [[TENS]] and [[Electrical muscle stimulation|EMS]] units marketed as erotic electrostimulation power sources. EMS units are designed to cause muscle contraction.

===Body toning and massage units===
An increasing number of "body toner" or "electromassage"-type power sources are being marketed directly to consumers. Though lacking in options compared to the more expensive specialized units, these have proven to be an inexpensive method for entry level practice.

===Homemade power sources===
Some people craft  "homemade" electrostimulation power sources, or adapt or modify commercial products (such as a [[High fidelity|Hifi]] or [[DVD]] system) that were never intended for electrostimulation of the human body. These can be dangerous practices; such improvised devices not specifically designed for use on the human body can easily cause injury. The risk is mostly twofold. First the device can supply too much power. Second the isolation of most devices is not suited for medical equipment. For example a transient over-voltage on the mains input can damage the isolation of the transformer, resulting in the output terminals becoming live.

Deaths have been reported from using a [[power strip]] (with switch) plugged into the [[Mains electricity|mains]] and connected to the nipples.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2008/01/york_county_man_accused_in_sex.html|title=York County man accused in sex electrocution of wife|date=January 25, 2008 |work=The Patriot-News |publisher=PennLive.com|accessdate=9 November 2010|location=Craley, Pa.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/bizarre&id=5913704 |title=Man accused of sex electrocution of wife|date=January 25, 2008|publisher=6abc.com|accessdate=9 November 2010|location=Craley, Pa.}}</ref>

===Erotic electrostimulation power sources===
Erotic electrostimulation power sources are specifically designed and manufactured for erotic use on the human body. The first [[Analogue electronics|analog]] devices became popular during the mid-1980s, and during the late 1990s [[digital]] devices also became available. Both types usually allow for adjustments of frequency and power output levels, some with complex preset "programs" and computer controls. The setups usually consist of a "box" and electrodes connected by wiring. Many of the boxes are portable and can be powered by [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] or come with built-in [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]]. Some units can be connected to remote operators via an [[Internet]]-connected [[computer]] or controlled via [[radio]] frequency [[key fob]]s.

===Other methods===
There are other medical methods that have led to patent filings, such as the discovery that placing electrodes in the spinal cord can induce pleasurable feelings leading to orgasm.<ref>{{US patent reference |number=6169924 |y=2001 |m=1 |d=2 |inventor=T. Stuart Meloy and W. Joseph Martin |title=Spinal cord stimulation}}. Retrieved 7 July 2012.</ref> There are also various apparatuses, with external or internal stimulation.

Lue, Emil A. Tanagho, and Richard A. Schmidt |title=Method and pacemaker for stimulating penile erection}}. Retrieved 7 July 2012.</ref>

Other kinds of apparatus use [[Electrotherapy#Interferential current (IFC)|interferential currents]] with four surface electrodes to replace the internal electrodes.

==Electrodes==
An [[electrode]] is used to deliver the actual electrostimulation to the body.

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Uretheral-electrode-application-deep.jpg|thumb|thumb|right|Application of a urethral electrode]] -->

For erotic electrostimulation, these are typically items designed to be applied to the genitals such as vaginal plugs and shields, [[butt plug|anal plug]]s, probes to directly stimulate the prostate, testicle rings, [[Cock and ball torture (sexual practice)|CBT boards]], [[cock ring]]s, urethral probes, and other items for [[penis|penile]] application. The pads used with TENS units are also used in the sexual application of electrostimulation. There are also electrified [[nipple]] and [[breast]] electrodes available, but there is disagreement within the e-stim community about their safety.

The electrodes can be made of [[metal]]s such as [[gold]], [[silver]], [[aluminum]], and [[stainless steel]]. There are also electrodes made out of [[conductive]] [[silicone]]. Conductive rubber is a cheap, flexible and efficient option.

==Lubrication==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
[[Lubrication]] plays an important role in the success of erotic electrostimulation since without it, there is a greater risk of high-frequency epidermal [[burn]]ing. Water-based lubricants are generally recommended, although [[olive oil]] is popular because it does not dry out as water-based lubricants can. Typically it is recommended to avoid any lubricant that contains [[silicone]] since it is an [[Insulator (electrical)|insulator]] and hence reduces conductivity. Practitioners of electrostimulation select lubricants for compatibility with the material of the electrodes, as well as for desirable conductive properties, which can maximize the strength and quality of the signal.
