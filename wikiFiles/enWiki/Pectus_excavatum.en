Pectus excavatum is sometimes referred to as cobbler's chest, sunken chest, or funnel chest.<ref name="FPnotebook">{{cite web |url=http://www.fpnotebook.com/Lung/Exam/PctsExcvtm.htm |title=Pectus Excavatum |work=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Spence, Roy A.

==Signs and symptoms==
The [[hallmark]] of the condition is a sunken appearance of the sternum. The heart can be displaced and/or rotated. [[Mitral valve prolapse]] may also be present. Base lung capacity is decreased.<ref name="emedicine"/>

==Causes==
Researchers are currently unsure as to the actual cause of pectus excavatum but hypothesize genetic defect.<ref name=Crump1992/> Approximately 37% of individuals with pectus excavatum have a first degree family member with the condition.<ref name=pmid8641129/> Physiologically, increased pressure ''in utero'', [[rickets]] and increased traction on the [[Human sternum|sternum]] due to abnormalities of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] have been postulated as specific mechanisms.<ref name=pmid8641129/> Pectus excavatum is also a relatively common symptom of [[Marfan syndrome]].<ref name="emedicine2">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/946315-overview |title=eMedicine&nbsp;— Marfan Syndrome |format= |work=Harold Chen}}</ref> Many children with [[spinal muscular atrophy]] develop pectus excavatum due to the [[diaphragmatic breathing]] that is common with the disease. Pectus excavatum also occurs in about 1% of persons diagnosed with [[Celiac disease]] for unknown reasons.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Pathophysiology==
Because the [[heart]] is located behind the [[Human sternum|sternum]], and because individuals with pectus excavatum have been shown to have visible deformities of the heart (seen both on radiological imaging and after autopsies), it has been hypothesized that there is impairment of function of the cardiovascular system in individuals with pectus excavatum. While some studies have demonstrated decreased cardiovascular function in pectus excavatum, there has been no consensus reached based on newer physiological tests (such as [[echocardiography]]) of the presence or degree of impairment in cardiovascular function in people with pectus excavatum. Similarly, there is no consensus on the degree of functional improvement after corrective surgery.<ref name=pmid8641129/>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Pectusexcavatum.png|thumb|Cross sectional scan of a chest with pectus excavatum]]
Pectus excavatum is initially suspected from visual examination of the anterior chest. [[Auscultation]] of the chest can reveal displaced heart beat and valve prolapse. There can be a [[heart murmur]] occurring during [[Systole (medicine)|systole]] caused by proximity between the sternum and the [[pulmonary artery]].<ref name="pmid4850886">{{cite journal |author=Guller B, Hable K |title=Cardiac findings in pectus excavatum in children: review and differential diagnosis |journal=[[Chest (journal)|Chest]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=165–71 |year=1974 |pmid=4850886 |doi= 10.1378/chest.66.2.165|url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/reprint/66/2/165}}</ref>
Lung sounds are usually clear yet diminished due to decreased base lung capacity.<ref name="emedicine"/>

Many scales have been developed to determine the degree of deformity in the chest wall. Most of these are variants on the distance between the sternum and the [[Vertebral column|spine]]. One such index is the ''Backer ratio'' which grades severity of deformity based on the ratio between the diameter of the vertebral body nearest to [[xiphosternal junction]] and the distance between the xiphosternal junction and the nearest vertebral body.<ref name="pmid13685690">{{cite journal |author=BACKER OG, BRUNNER S, LARSEN V |title=The surgical treatment of funnel chest.

An index over 3.25 is often defined as severe.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jeannette Diana-Zerpa; Nancy Thacz Browne; Laura M. Flanigan; Carmel A.

[[File:Trichterbrust im Roentgenbild des Thorax pa.jpg|thumb|Pectus excavatum on PA chest radiograph with shift of heart shadow to the left and radioopacity of the right paracardiac lung field]]
[[Chest x-ray]]s are also useful in the diagnosis. The chest x-ray in pectus excavatum can show an opacity in the right lung area that can be mistaken for an infiltrate (such as that seen with [[pneumonia]]).<ref name="pmid2392647">{{cite journal |author=Hoeffel JC, Winants D, Marcon F, Worms AM |title=Radioopacity of the right paracardiac lung field due to pectus excavatum (funnel chest) |journal=Rontgenblatter |volume=43 |issue=7 |pages=298–300 |year=1990 |pmid=2392647 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Some studies also suggest that the [[Haller index]] can be calculated based on chest x-ray as opposed to CT scanning in individuals who have no limitation in their function.<ref name="pmid18206458">{{cite journal |author=Mueller C, Saint-Vil D, Bouchard S |title=Chest x-ray as a primary modality for preoperative imaging of pectus excavatum |journal=Journal of Pediatric Surgery |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=71–3 |year=2008 |pmid=18206458 |doi=10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2007.09.023 }}</ref>

Pectus excavatum is differentiated from other disorders by a series of elimination of signs and symptoms. [[Pectus carinatum]] is excluded by the simple observation of a collapsing of the [[sternum]] rather than a protrusion. [[Kyphoscoliosis]] is excluded by diagnostic imaging of the spine, where in pectus excavatum the spine usually appears normal in structure.

==Treatment==
Treatment for pectus excavatum can involve either [[Invasive (medical)|invasive]] or [[Non-invasive (medical)|non-invasive]] techniques or a combination of both. Before an operation proceeds several tests are usually to be performed. These include, but are not limited to, a [[CT scan]], [[pulmonary function test]]s, and [[cardiology]] exams (such as auscultation and [[ECG]]s).<ref name=Crump1992/> After a CT scan is taken the [[Haller index]] is measured. The patient's Haller is calculated by obtaining the ratio of the transverse diameter (the horizontal distance of the inside of the ribcage) and the anteroposterior diameter (the shortest distance between the vertebrae and sternum).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/jbpneu/v30n6/en_a03v30n6.pdf|title=How the Haller is measured.

===Surgery===
Surgical correction has been shown to repair any functional symptoms that may occur in the condition, such as respiratory problems or heart murmurs, provided that permanent damage has not already arisen from an extremely severe case.<ref name=Crump1992/>

====Ravitch technique====
The Ravitch technique is an invasive surgery that was introduced in 1949,<ref>{{cite journal| author=Ravitch MM | title=The Operative Treatment of Pectus Excavatum | journal=Ann Surg | year=1949 | month=April | volume=129 | issue=4 | pages=429–44 | pmid=17859324 | pmc=1514034 | doi=10.1097/00000658-194904000-00002}}</ref> and developed in the 1950s to treat the condition. This procedure involves creating an incision along the chest through which the cartilage is removed and the sternum detached. A small bar is then inserted underneath the sternum to hold it up in the desired position. The bar is left implanted until the cartilage grows back, typically about 6 months. The bar is subsequently removed in a simple out-patient procedure. The Ravitch technique is not widely practiced because it is so invasive. It is often used in older patients, where the sternum has calcified, when the deformity is asymmetrical, or when the less invasive Nuss procedure has proven unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Theresa D. Luu MD | title=Surgery for Recurrent Pectus Deformities | journal=The Annals of Thoracic Surgery | year=2009 | month=November | volume=88| pmid=19853122 | issue=5 | pages=1627–1631 | doi=10.1016/j.athoracsur.2009.06.008 }}</ref>

====Nuss procedure====

[[File:Nuss x-ray.jpg|left|thumb|175px|X-Ray of a 15 year old male after undergoing the Nuss procedure]]
Since then, Dr. [[Donald Nuss]], based at [[Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters]] (CHKD) in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], has developed a technique that is minimally invasive.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Nuss D, Kelly RE Jr, Croitoru DP, Katz ME | title=A 10-year review of a minimally invasive technique for the correction of pectus excavatum | journal=J Pediatr Surg | year=1998 | month=April | volume=33 | issue=4 | pages=545–52 | pmid=9574749 | doi=10.1016/S0022-3468(98)90314-1 }}</ref><ref name="Pilegaard">{{cite journal | last=Pilegaard | first=HK | coauthors=Licht PB | title=Early results following the Nuss operation for pectus excavatum--a single-institution experience of 383 patients | journal=Interactive Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery | volume=7 | issue=1 | pages=54–57 | publisher=Oxford University Press | month=February | year=2008 | url=http://icvts.ctsnetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/7/1/54 | pmid=17951271 | accessdate=2008-04-18 | doi=10.1510/icvts.2007.160937 }}</ref> The Nuss procedure involves slipping in one or more concave steel bars into the chest, underneath the sternum. The bar is flipped to a convex position so as to push outward on the sternum, correcting the deformity. The bar usually stays in the body for about two years, although many surgeons are now moving toward leaving them in for up to five years. When the bones have solidified into place, the bar is removed through [[outpatient surgery]].

====Pectus UP====
A new technique for repairing pectus excavatum that utilizes a set of implants placed on the outer surface of the rib cage in a procedure known as Taulinoplastia.  This procedure attempts to accomplish the same benefits of the Nuss procedure with minimal blood loss, a shorter recovery period, no risk to internal organs, shorter surgical intervention, small incisions and does not require intensive treatment or post operational tubes.<ref>http://www.venturamedicaltechnologies.com/en/productes/per-que-pectus-up.php</ref>

===Vacuum bell===
{{main|Vacuum bell (medicine)}}
A relatively new alternative to surgery is the vacuum bell. It consists of a bowl shaped device which fits over the caved-in area; the air is then removed by the use of a hand pump. The vacuum created by this lifts the sternum upwards, lessening the severity of the deformity. As it is such a recent device there is currently no information as to whether it is effective in the long term.<ref name="Haecker">{{cite journal | last=Haecker | first=FM | coauthors=Mayr J | title=The vacuum bell for treatment of pectus excavatum: an alternative to surgical correction? | journal=European Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery | volume=29 | issue=4 | pages=557–561 | month=April | year=2006 | pmid=16473516 | doi=10.1016/j.ejcts.2006.01.025 }}</ref>

===Cosmetic and light treatments===
The cosmetic appearance of pectus excavatum can be treated with a dermal filler called [[Polyalkylimide|Bio-Alcamid]].<ref name="Lahiri">{{cite journal | last=Lahiri | first=A | coauthors=Waters R | title=Experience with Bio-Alcamid, a new soft tissue endoprosthesis | journal=Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery | volume=60 | issue=6 | pages=663–667 | month=February | year=2007 | pmid=17485056 | doi=10.1016/j.bjps.2006.07.010 }}</ref> However, as this does nothing to alleviate the actual deformity it will not prevent any physiological symptoms caused by the condition.

Mild cases have also reportedly been treated with [[corset]]-like orthopedic support vests and exercise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://laceitpe.com |title=LaceIT PE Brace |work=Advanced Orthotic Designs, Inc. }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orthopectus.com.br/fmethod.htm |title=Orthopectus |work=Dr. Sydney A. Haje, Ortopedista}}</ref>

There are also prosthetic implants available to fill the depressed area. Solid silicone implants have been successfully used for many years with acceptable results in some cases.<ref name="pmid18178533">{{cite journal |author=Saour S, Shaaban H, McPhail J, McArthur P |title=Customised silicone prostheses for the reconstruction of chest wall defects: technique of manufacture and final outcome |journal=J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg |volume= 61|issue= 10|year=2007 |month=September |pmid=18178533 |doi=10.1016/j.bjps.2007.07.019 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1748-6815(07)00405-6 |accessdate=2008-08-21 |pages=1205–9}}</ref><ref name="pmid11716258">{{cite journal |author=Wechselberger G, Ohlbauer M, Haslinger J, Schoeller T, Bauer T, Piza-Katzer H |title=Silicone implant correction of pectus excavatum |journal=Ann Plast Surg |volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=489–93 |year=2001 |month=November |pmid=11716258 |doi= 10.1097/00000637-200111000-00003|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0148-7043&volume=47&issue=5&spage=489 |accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref> More recently a porex implant has been used which is a similar material used to replace [[human skull|skull]] in brain surgery and severe head injuries.<ref name="pmid17851713">{{cite journal |author=Grappolini S, Fanzio PM, D'Addetta PG, Todde A, Infante M |title=Aesthetic treatment of pectus excavatum: a new endoscopic technique using a porous polyethylene implant |journal=Aesthetic Plast Surg |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=105–10 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=17851713 |doi=10.1007/s00266-007-9025-6}}</ref>

===Magnetic mini-mover procedure===
The magnetic mini-mover procedure (3MP) is a technique used to correct pectus excavatum by using two magnets to realign the sternum with the rest of the chest and ribcage.<ref name="Harrison">{{cite journal | last=Harrison | first=MR | title=Magnetic Mini-Mover Procedure for pectus excavatum: I. Development, design, and simulations for feasibility and safety | journal=Journal of Pediatric Surgery | volume=42 | issue=1 | pages=81–85 | month=January | year=2007 | url=http://pedsurg.ucsf.edu/media/92580/pectus_article.pdf | format=PDF | pmid=17208545 | accessdate=2008-04-23 | doi=10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2006.09.042 | author-separator=, | author2=Estefan-Ventura D | author3=Fechter R | display-authors=2 | last4=Moran | first4=Arthur M. | last5=Christensen | first5=Darrell }}</ref> One magnet is inserted 1&nbsp;cm into the patient's body on the lower end of the sternum, the other is placed externally onto a custom fitted brace. These two magnets generate around 0.04&nbsp;[[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] (T) in order to slowly move the sternum outwards over a number of years. The maximum [[magnetic field]] that can be applied to the body safely is around 4&nbsp;T, making this technique safe from a magnetic viewpoint.<ref name="Harrison"/> The 3MP technique's main advantages are that it is more cost-effective than major surgical approaches such as the Nuss procedure and it is considerably less painful postoperatively. One potential adverse effect of 3MP is inactivation of implanted devices such as an [[artificial pacemaker]]. Since the 3MP is still in a trial period it is unknown whether long term wearing of the magnet will affect the skin or other vital organs.

==Epidemiology==
Pectus excavatum occurs in an estimated 1 in 150-1000 births, with male predominance (male-to-female ratio of 3:1). Occurrences of the condition in family members have been reported in 35% to 45% of cases.<ref name="emedicine">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1004953-overview |title=eMedicine&nbsp;— Pectus Excavatum |format= |work=Andre Hebra }}</ref><ref name="ui">{{cite web |url=http://www.uihealthcare.com/topics/medicaldepartments/surgery/pectusexcavatum/index.html |title=Pectus Excavatum: Frequently Asked Questions: Surgery: UI Health Topics |work=Harold M.

==In animals==
Pectus excavatum is also known to occur in animals, e.g. the [[Munchkin (cat)|Munchkin]] breed of cat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.messybeast.com/gene-anomalies.htm |title=Genetic Anomalies of Cats |work=}}</ref> Some procedures used to treat the condition in animals have not been used in humans, such as the use of a cast with sutures wrapped around the sternum and the use of internal and external [[Splint (medicine)|splints]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Fossum | first=TW | coauthors=Boudrieau RJ, Hobson HP, Rudy RL | title=Surgical correction of pectus excavatum, using external splintage in two dogs and a cat | journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association | volume=195 | issue=1 | pages=91–7 | year=1989 | pmid=2759902 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Risselada M, de Rooster H, Liuti T, Polis I, van Bree H |title=Use of internal splinting to realign a noncompliant sternum in a cat with pectus excavatum |journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association |volume=228 |issue=7 |pages=1047–52 |year=2006 |pmid=16579783 |doi=10.2460/javma.228.7.1047 |url=http://avmajournals.avma.org/doi/abs/10.2460/javma.228.7.1047}}</ref> These techniques are generally used in immature animals with flexible cartilage.<ref>{{cite journal | author = McAnulty JF, Harvey CE | title = Repair of pectus excavatum by percutaneous suturing and temporary external coaptation in a kitten | journal = Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association | volume = 194 | issue = 8 | pages = 1065–7 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2651373 | doi = }}</ref>
