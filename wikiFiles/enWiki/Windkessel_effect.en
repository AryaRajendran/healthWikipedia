'''Windkessel effect''' is a term used in [[medicine]] to account for the shape of the [[arterial blood pressure]] waveform in terms of the interaction between the [[stroke volume]] and the [[Compliance (physiology)|compliance]] of the aorta and large elastic arteries (Windkessel vessels).  Windkessel when loosely translated from [[German language|German]] to English means 'air chamber',<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sagawa K, Lie RK, Schaefer J |title=Translation of Otto Frank's paper "Die Grundform des Arteriellen Pulses" Zeitschrift für Biologie 37: 483-526 (1899) |journal=J.

(2005): ''Review of Medical Physiology'', Twenty-Second Edition, page 587. The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.</ref> The walls of large elastic arteries (e.g. [[aorta]], [[common carotid]], [[subclavian artery|subclavian]], and [[pulmonary arteries]] and their larger branches) contain elastic fibers, formed of [[elastin]].  These arteries distend when the [[blood pressure]] rises during [[Systole (medicine)|systole]] and recoil when the blood pressure falls during [[diastole]].  Since the rate of blood entering these elastic arteries exceeds that leaving them due to the [[peripheral resistance]] there is a net storage of blood during systole which discharges during diastole. The distensibility of the large elastic arteries is therefore analogous to a [[capacitor]]. 

The Windkessel effect helps in [[damping]] the fluctuation in [[blood pressure]] ([[pulse pressure]]) over the [[cardiac cycle]] and assists in the maintenance of organ perfusion during diastole when cardiac ejection ceases. The idea of the Windkessel was alluded to by [[Giovanni Borelli]], although [[Stephen Hales]] articulated the concept more clearly and drew the analogy with an air chamber used in fire engines in the 18th century.<ref>Stephen Hales ''Statical Essays: Haemastaticks'', 1733</ref> [[Otto Frank (physiologist)]] an influential German physiologist developed the concept and provided a firm mathematical foundation.<ref name = "Frank 1899" /> Frank's model is sometimes called a two-element Windkessel to distinguish it from more recent and more elaborate Windkessel models (e.g. three- or four-element Windkessels).<ref>Westerhof N, Lankhaar JW, Westerhof BE.The arterial Windkessel.Med Biol Eng Comput. 2009 Feb;47(2):131-41. Epub 2008 Jun 10.</ref>

The Windkessel effect becomes diminished with age as the elastic arteries become less compliant, termed ''hardening of the arteries'' or [[arteriosclerosis]], probably secondary to fragmentation and loss of elastin. The reduction in the Windkessel effect results in increased [[pulse pressure]] and elevated systolic pressure for a given [[stroke volume]].  Elevated systolic pressure ([[hypertension]]) predicts [[myocardial infarction]], [[stroke]], [[heart failure]] and a variety of other cardiovascular diseases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lewington S, Clarke R, Qizilbash N, Peto R, Collins R |title=Age-specific relevance of usual blood pressure to vascular mortality: a meta-analysis of individual data for one million adults in 61 prospective studies |journal=Lancet |volume=360 |issue=9349 |pages=1903–13 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12493255 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)11911-8|url=}}</ref>

Although the Windkessel is a simple and convenient concept, it is widely seen as in conflict with, and superseded by, modern approaches that interpret arterial pressure and flow waveforms in terms of wave propagation and reflection,<ref>McDonald D.A.

''McDonald's Blood Flow in Arteries: Theoretical, Experimental and Clinical Principles''.
