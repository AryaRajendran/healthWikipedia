'''Hereditary stomatocytosis''' describes a number of inherited autosomal dominant human conditions which affect the red blood cell, in which the membrane or outer coating of the cell 'leaks' sodium and potassium ions.

==Pathophysiology==

Osmosis leads to the red blood cell having a constant tendency to swell and burst. This tendency is countered by manipulating the flow of sodium and potassium ions. A 'pump' forces sodium out of the cell and potassium in, and this action is balanced by a process called 'the passive leak'. In the hereditary stomatocytoses, the passive leak is increased and the cell becomes swamped with salt and water. The cell lyses and a [[haemolytic anaemia]] results. For as yet unknown reasons, the cells take on an abnormal shape, resembling a mouth or 'stoma'.

==Variants==

Haematologists have identified a number of variants. These can be classified as below. 

*Overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis
*Dehydrated HSt (hereditary xerocytosis; hereditary hyperphosphatidylcholine haemolytic anaemia)
*Dehydrated with perinatal ascites
*Cryohydrocytosis
*'Blackburn' variant.
*Familial pseudohyperkalaemia

There are other families that do not fall neatly into any of these classifications.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oski FA, Naiman JL, Blum SF, ''et al.'' |title=Congenital hemolytic anemia with high-sodium, low-potassium red cells.

Stomatocytosis is also found as a hereditary disease in Alaskan malamute and miniature schnauzer dogs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thrall, MA |title=Veterinary Hematology and Clinical Chemistry, Blackwell Publishing |pages=71–72 |year=2006 |pmid= |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Treatment==
At present there is no specific treatment. Many patients with haemolytic anaemia take [[folic acid]] (vitamin B<sub>9</sub>) since the greater turnover of cells consumes this vitamin. During crises transfusion may be required. Clotting problems can occur for which anticoagulation may be needed.

==Causes==

The cause for these hereditary conditions is now understood to be various mutations in the [[erythrocyte]] membrane protein, [[band 3]]. It is this protein which mediates the cation leaks which are characteristic of this disease.<ref name="pmid16227998">{{cite journal |author=Bruce LJ, Robinson HC, Guizouarn H, ''et al.'' |title=Monovalent cation leaks in human red cells caused by single amino-acid substitutions in the transport domain of the band 3 chloride-bicarbonate exchanger, AE1 |journal=Nat.
