'''Molars''' are the most posterior and most complicated kind of [[tooth]] in most [[mammal]]s. In many mammals they grind food; hence the Latin name ''mola'', "[[millstone]]". The molars are four-[[cusp (dentistry)|cusped]] teeth.

Adult humans have twelve molars, in four groups of three at the back of the mouth. The third, rearmost molar in each group is called a [[Third molar|wisdom tooth]]. It is the last tooth to appear, breaking through the front of the gum at about the age of twenty, although this varies from individual to individual. Ethnicity can also have an impact on the age at which this occurs, with statistical variations between groups. In some cases, it may not even erupt at all.

The human mouth contains upper (maxillary) and lower (mandibular) molars. They are: [[maxillary first molar]], [[maxillary second molar]], [[maxillary third molar]], [[mandibular first molar]], [[mandibular second molar]], and [[mandibular third molar]].

==Molars among species==

*'''Tribosphenic''': This kind is found in [[insectivore]]s and young [[platypus]]es (adults have no teeth). Upper molars look like three-pointed mountain ranges; lowers look like two peaks and a third off to the side.
*'''Quadrate''': This kind is found in [[human]]s and various other species. Four cusps are arranged in a rectangle; there may be a fifth.
*'''Bunodont''': The cusps, instead of being sharp peaks, are rounded hills. The entire tooth is covered in [[Tooth enamel|enamel]], and is most common among omnivores such as the [[pig]], the [[bear]] and [[humans]].
*'''Hypsodont''': There is a lot of enamel and dentine above the gumline and the top of the pulp. This kind of molar is found in mammals that wear their teeth a lot, such as the [[horse]].
*'''Zalambdodont''': The tooth has two ridges that meet at an angle, forming the letter lambda. 
*'''Dilambdodont''': Like zalambdodont, but there are two lambdas on one tooth.
*'''Lophodont''': The tooth has a few ridges perpendicular to the jaw.
*'''Selenodont''': The tooth has a crescent-shaped ridge or ridges.
*'''Loxodont''': The tooth has several parallel oblique ridges on its surface. The [[elephant]] ''Loxodonta'' is named for this feature.
And the Molars are used for for chewing and grinding.

==Tribosphenic molar==
The molar design that is considered one of the most important characteristics of mammals is a three-cusped shape called a '''tribosphenic molar'''.  This molar design has two important features: the ''[[trigonid]]'', or shearing end, and the ''[[talonid]]'', or crushing heel.  In modern mammals that have tribosphenic molars the trigonid is towards the front and the talonid towards the rear.

The tribosphenic design appears in all groups of mammals. Some paleontologists believe that it developed independently in [[monotreme]]s (or australosphenidans), rather than being inherited from an ancestor that they share with [[marsupial]]s and [[placental]]s (or boreosphenidans); but this idea has critics and the debate is still going on.<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Stokstad, E. | title=Tooth Theory Revises History of Mammals  | journal=Science | date=January 2001 | volume=291 | pages=26 | doi=10.1126/science.10.1126/SCIENCE.291.5501.26 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/291/5501/26?ck=nck | pmid=11191993 | issue=5501}}</ref>
For example, the dentition of the [[Early Cretaceous]] monotreme ''[[Steropodon]]'' is similar to those of ''[[Peramuridae|Peramus]]'' and [[Dryolestoidea|dryolestoids]], which suggests that monotremes are related to some pre-tribosphenic therian mammals,<ref>{{Cite journal

Some [[Jurassic]] mammals, such as ''[[Shuotherium]]'' and ''[[Pseudotribos]]'', have "reversed tribosphenic" molars, in which the talonid is towards the front. This variant is regarded as an example of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{ cite journal | author8=Luo, Z-X., Ji, Q. and Yuan, C-X. | title=Convergent dental adaptations in pseudo-tribosphenic and tribosphenic mammals | journal=Nature | issue=  7166| pages=93–97 | date=November 2007 | doi=10.1038/nature06221 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v450/n7166/full/nature06221.html | author=Luo, Zhe-Xi | volume=450 | pmid=17972884 | last2=Ji | first2=Q | last3=Yuan | first3=CX}}</ref>
