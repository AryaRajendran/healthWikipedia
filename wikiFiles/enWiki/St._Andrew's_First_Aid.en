==St Andrew's Ambulance Corps==

The Corps was formed in 1904, in order to bring together the various ambulance Corps that had formed and to allow these people to improve their first aid skills by practising together and being available at public gathering.<ref name= "History">{{cite web| last =St Andrew's Ambulance Association| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Our History| work =| publisher =| date =| url =http://www.firstaid.org.uk/history.htm| doi =| accessdate =2007-09-06  |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070704232955/http://www.firstaid.org.uk/history.htm |archivedate = 2007-07-04}}</ref> The aim of the Corps has not changed over the past 100 years, and today it still exists and provides an opportunity for people to practice and use their first aid skills.

===Structure===

The Corps is made up from over 80 Corps Companies, each of which are based within a specific area and come under the administration of one of the Executive Committees. Overall control of the Corps comes from the Association, with National Headquarters providing administrative support.<ref>{{cite book| last =St Andrew's Ambulance Association| first = | authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Corps Regulations| publisher =| year =2005| location =Glasgow| pages = Chapter 2, pages 4–5| url =| doi =| id =  | isbn =| nopp =true }}</ref>

A Corps Company consists of volunteer members who attend regular training meetings, go on duty to provide first aid cover at events and oversee the general running of the company. There are a number of different roles within a Corps Company:
*'''Associate Member''' - Someone who does not hold a Standard First Aid certificate, but is involved in the running of the company in some other way (fundraising, accounts, administration etc.).
*'''Member''' - Someone who holds a Standard First Aid Certificate, and attends events as a first aider as well helping in the running of the company.
*'''Secretary''' - The person who performs general administrative duties such as taking minutes at AGMs or distributing correspondence from the Association.
*'''Treasurer''' - The person who administers company accounts, as well as paying expenses to members (for travel to/from duties).
*'''Public Duty Officer''' - The person who organises the first aid cover required at duties, and keeps a record of casualties treated.
*'''Commandant''' - The person in overall charge of the company.
*'''Deputy Commandant''' - The person who supports the work of the Commandant
*'''Assistant Commandant''' - This position (or positions) is only present in larger companies, in which the Commandant and Deputy may require more support in running of the company.
*'''Section Leader''' - Larger companies may also have section leaders who are responsible for certain roles, and groups of members, allowing commandants to focus on the overall running of the company.
*'''Honorary Medical Officer''' - A medically qualified person, who advises the company on medical and first aid matters and can also attend public duties.
*'''Trainer/Assesor''' - A member who has undertaken the Trainer/Assesor course, so that they can provide training to the Corps Company as well as to the public.
*'''Youth Leaders''' - A member responsible for training and leadership of the youth groups in the Company.<ref>{{cite book| last =St Andrew's Ambulance Association| first = | authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Corps Regulations| publisher =| year =2005| location =Glasgow| pages = Chapter 3, pages 4–12| url =| doi =| id =  | isbn =| nopp =true }}</ref>

===Further training===

Members of the Corps are constantly updating their first aid skill at regular meetings, however there is also opportunity to undertake further training courses:
*'''Automated External Defibrillation''' - A course that allows members to use an [[Automated external defibrillator|AED]] whilst on duty<ref>{{cite web| last =St Andrew's Ambulance Association| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Volunteering FAQs| work =| publisher =| date =| url =http://www.firstaid.org.uk/volunteering_FAQs.htm| doi =| accessdate =2007-09-06  |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070403134947/http://www.firstaid.org.uk/volunteering_FAQs.htm |archivedate = 2007-04-03}}</ref>
*'''Moving and Handling''' - A comprehensive course that covers safe handling and transport of casualties. Techniques taught include [[scoop stretcher]],  [[Long spine board|spinal board]], [[cervical collar]], [[Gurney|trolley bed]], carry chairs and carry sheets.<ref>{{cite web| last =St Andrew's Ambulance Association| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Moving and Handling - Casualties| work =| publisher =| date =| url =http://www.firstaid.org.uk/MH_Casualties.htm| doi =| accessdate =2007-09-06  |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070925101031/http://www.firstaid.org.uk/MH_Casualties.htm |archivedate = 2007-09-25}}</ref>
*'''Officers' Training Course''' - A course that allows members to take up the positions of Commandant, Deputy Commandant or Assistant Commandant.<ref>{{cite book| last =St Andrew's Ambulance Association| first = | authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Corps Regulations| publisher =| year =2005| location =Glasgow| pages = Chapter 3, page 6| url =| doi =| id =  | isbn =| nopp =true }}</ref>

There is also training in radio communications, as [[Two-way radio|radios]] are used by members at many duties in order to help speed up communications, and better mobilise members and equipment in response to incidents.<ref>{{cite book| last =St Andrew's Ambulance Association| first = | authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Corps Regulations| publisher =| year =2005| location =Glasgow| pages = Chapter 9, page 4| url =| doi =| id =  | isbn =| nopp =true }}</ref>

===Duties===

The Corps supplies members to duties across the country, ranging from village fêtes to international sporting events and music festivals. For example, St Andrew's provides cover at Scotland's three largest stadia ([[Celtic Park]], [[Hampden Park]], [[Ibrox Stadium]]), as well as major festivals such as [[T in the Park]] and Live at Loch Lomond.

===Uniform===
[[File:StAndrewsKitBag.jpg|thumb|Backpack style first aid kit]]
St Andrew's first aiders are required to wear uniform when on duty and are encouraged to wear it whenever they are representing the organisation. There are currently three uniform sets:
*Number 1 Uniform - Black trousers, white shirt (with Association logo) with rank slides, clip-on tie, tunic and peaked caps. This uniform is only for ceremonial occasions
*Number 2 Uniform - Black combat trousers, white shirt (with Association logo), clip-on tie, black NATO pullover with rank slides and black fleece. This uniform can be used for public duties.
*Number 3 Uniform - Blue coveralls (consisting of a royal blue squad jacket and trousers), white T-shirt. This uniform can be used for public duties.

In addition, there are high visibility jackets, hard hats, ski hats, waterproof jackets and backpack style first aid kits.<ref>{{cite book| last =St Andrew's Ambulance Association| first = | authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Corps Regulations| publisher =| year =2005| location =Glasgow| pages = Chapter 6, pages 3–6| url =| doi =| id =  | isbn =| nopp =true }}</ref>

A uniform review has just concluded, and soon a new uniform will roll out, which will see the many different variations available scaled down.

==Relationship with other organisations==

St Andrew's, [[St John Ambulance in England and Wales|St John Ambulance]] and the [[British Red Cross Society]] collectively form the Voluntary Aid Societies. Together, the organisations produce the official First Aid Manual in the United Kingdom.

Following an agreement in 1908, [[St John Ambulance in England and Wales|St John Ambulance]] ceased to operate in Scotland and St Andrew's ceased to operate in England.<ref>{{cite web| last =The Order of St John| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Historical Background| work =| publisher =| date =| url =http://www.stjohnscotland.org.uk/ONE.htm| doi =| accessdate =2007-09-11  |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070614043742/http://www.stjohnscotland.org.uk/ONE.htm |archivedate = 2007-06-14}}</ref> St Andrew's enjoys goods relations with the [[British Red Cross]], and they often work in partnership at larger duties such as [[T in the Park]].

== History ==
===Formation and early years===

In 1882, St Andrew's Ambulance Association was formed in [[Glasgow]] by a group of local doctors and businessmen who were concerned by the rapid increase in accidents resulting from traffic and modern machinery. First aid and casualty transportation classes were conducted and Scotland's first ambulance was bought by the Association in April 1882, which served Glasgow and the surrounding area providing first aid and transportation to hospital to accident victims. In the following years, the number of calls the Association responded to grew so as by 1886 there were six ambulances stationed in towns throughout Scotland.<ref name="History book">{{cite book| last =St Andrew's Ambulance Association| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =The history of St. Andrew's Ambulance Association, 1882-1982| publisher =St Andrew's Ambulance Association| year =1983| location =Glasgow| pages = | url =| doi =| id =  | isbn =}}</ref>[[File:Ambulance Handbook.JPG|left|thumb|Dr George Beatson's ''Ambulance Hand-book'' (5th ed.)]]

In order to make teaching more uniform, in 1891 the Association published [[George Beatson|Dr George T. Beatson]]'s Ambulance Hand-book that provided a concise overview of anatomy, physiology, injuries, first aid treatment and casualty transportation. The book remained the Association standard text for over 40 years as it was updated and republished.<ref name= "History book">History Book</ref>

At the turn of the century, the Association underwent two major changes: In 1899, a [[Royal Charter]] was granted by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] that changed the Association from a collection of individuals to a legally recognised single entity and in 1904 the St Andrew's Ambulance Corps was formed to bring together the various ambulance groups around the country under a single administration.<ref name="History"/>

===First World War===

Within 48 hours of war being declared, the Corps was able to entirely staff all of Scotland's military hospitals, freeing the regular staff for service. In addition to this, St Andrew's were also able to assemble two Foreign Service Units (which served in France and in hospital ships), a Military Nursing Service (derived from females Corps members) and a transport service alongside the British Red Cross attending to wounded soldiers from hospital trains.<ref>{{cite book| last =Bowser| first =Thekla| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =The story of British V.A.D. work in the Great War| publisher =Imperial War Museum| year =1917| location =London| pages =281–284 | url =| doi =| id =  | isbn =1-901623-60-2}}</ref> Whilst all of this was happening, St Andrew's usual civilian work of first aid training and casualty transportation continued unabated (albeit the additional services placed strain on the Association's funds).<ref name= "History book">History Book</ref>

===Between World Wars===

After the First World War ended, the [[British Red Cross|British Red Cross Society]] presented the Association with a large number of motor ambulance wagons that were no longer required by the military. This allowed a complete ambulance service to be extended throughout Scotland. In order to meet the needs of the expanding organisation, the Association commissioned plans for permanent Headquarters to be built in the North Street, Glasgow. This building opened in 1929 and its facilities included a garage, workshops, offices, classrooms and a drill hall.<ref name= "History book">History Book</ref> By 1939, the Association was granted Royal Patronage, with [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|The Queen Mother]] as [[patron]].<ref name="History"/>

===Second World War===

The Association faced the task of preparing the Scottish public for air raids, and it responded by providing classes in Aid Raid Precautions, Anti-Gas Precautions and First Aid for air raid casualties. As the First World War, St Andrew's was active in the war effort: the Corps provided thousands of staff for the Civil Nursing Reserve, transportation of casualties after air raids and providing first aid and nursing training to school children. In Glasgow, the Association provided accommodation for the newly formed Blood Transfusion Service, as well as arranging free transport for donors.
