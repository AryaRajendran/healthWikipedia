[[File:Postcentral gyrus.gif|thumb|Postcentral gyrus (animation)]]
The lateral '''postcentral gyrus''' is a prominent structure in the [[parietal lobe]] of the human [[brain]] and an important landmark. It is the location of the '''primary somatosensory cortex''', the main sensory receptive area for the [[somatosensory system|sense of touch]]. Like other sensory areas, there is a map of sensory space in this location, called the ''sensory [[Cortical homunculus|homunculus]]''.

The primary somatosensory cortex was initially defined from surface stimulation studies of [[Wilder Penfield]], and parallel surface potential studies of Bard, Woolsey, and Marshall. Although initially defined to be roughly the same as [[Brodmann area]]s 3, 1 and 2, more recent work by [[Jon Kaas|Kaas]] has suggested that for homogeny with other sensory fields only area 3 should be referred to as "primary somatosensory cortex", as it receives the bulk of the [[Thalamocortical radiations|thalamocortical projections]] from the sensory input fields. 

== Postcentral gyrus ==
The lateral postcentral gyrus is bounded by:
*[[medial longitudinal fissure]] [[anatomical terms of location|medially]] (to the middle)
*[[central sulcus]] [[anatomical terms of location|rostrally]] (in front)
*[[postcentral sulcus]] [[anatomical terms of location|caudally]] (in back)
*[[lateral sulcus]] [[anatomical terms of location|inferiorly]] (underneath)

== Brodmann areas 3, 1 and 2 ==
'''Brodmann areas 3, 1, and 2''' make up the primary somatosensory cortex of the human [[brain]] (or '''S1''').  Because [[Korbinian Brodmann|Brodmann]] sliced the [[brain]] somewhat obliquely, he encountered area 1 first; however, from [[Anatomical terms of location#Directional terms|rostral]] to [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]], the [[Brodmann area|Brodmann]] designations are 3, 1, and 2, respectively. 

Brodmann area 3 is subdivided into areas 3a and 3b. Where BA 1 occupies the apex of the postcentral gyrus, the rostral border of BA 3a is in the nadir of the Central sulcus, and is caudally followed by BA 3b, then BA 1, with BA 2 following and ending in the nadir of the postcentral sulcus. BA 3b is now conceived as the primary somatosensory cortex because 1) it receives dense inputs from the [[Pulvinar_nuclei|NP nucleus]] of the thalamus; 2) its neurons are highly responsive to somatosensory stimuli, but not other stimuli; 3) lesions here impair somatic sensation; and 4) electrical stimulation evokes somatic sensory experience. BA 3a also receives dense input from the thalamus; however, this area is concerned with [[proprioception]].

Areas 1 and 2 receive dense inputs from BA 3b. The projection from 3b to 1 primarily relays texture information; the projection to area 2 emphasizes size and shape. Lesions confined to these areas produce predictable dysfunction in texture, size, and shape discrimination.

Somatosensory cortex, like other neocortex, is layered. Like other sensory cortex (i.e., visual and auditory) the thalamic inputs project into layer IV, which in turn project into other layers. As in other sensory cortices, S1 neurons are grouped together with similar inputs and responses into vertical columns that extend across cortical layers (e.g., As shown by Vernon Mountcastle, into alternating layers of slowly adapting and rapidly adapting neurons; or spatial segmentation of the vibrissae on mouse/rat cerebral cortex). 

This area of cortex, as shown by [[Wilder Penfield]] and others, is organized somatotopically, having the pattern of a homunculus.  That is, the legs and trunk fold over the midline; the arms and hands are along the middle of the area shown here; and the face is near the bottom of the figure.  While it is not well-shown here, the lips and hands are enlarged on a proper [[homunculus]], since a larger number of [[neuron]]s in the [[cerebral cortex]] are devoted to processing information from these areas.

The positions of Brodmann areas 3, 1, and 2 are - from the nadir of the central sulcus toward the apex of the postcentral gyrus - 3a, 3b, 1, and 2, respectively.

These areas contain cells that project to the [[secondary somatosensory cortex]].

== Clinical significance ==
Lesions affecting the primary somatosensory cortex produce characteristic symptoms including: [[agraphesthesia]], [[astereognosia]], loss of [[vibration]], [[proprioception]], and [[fine touch]] (because the third-order neuron of the medial-lemniscal pathway cannot synapse in the cortex). It can also produce [[hemineglect]], if it affects the non-dominant hemisphere.

It could also reduce [[nociception]], [[thermoception]], and [[crude touch]], but, since information from the [[spinothalamic tract]] is interpreted mainly by other areas of the brain (see [[insular cortex]] and [[cingulate gyrus]]), it is not as relevant as the other symptoms{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source. Nociception, for example, is known to project to and be heavily processed by areas 1, 3a and possibly 3b (see Vierck CJ et al. Role of primary somatosensory cortex in the coding of pain. PAIN (2012), http://dx.doi.org/10/1016/j.pain.2012.10.021) of the post central gyrus.|date=March 2013}}.
