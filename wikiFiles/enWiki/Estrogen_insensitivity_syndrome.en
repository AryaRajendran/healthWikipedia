The '''estrogen insensitivity syndrome''' (EIS) or '''estrogen resistance''' is a form of [[congenital estrogen deficiency]]<ref name="pmid11403900">{{cite journal |author=Rochira V, Balestrieri A, Madeo B, ''et al.'' |title=Congenital estrogen deficiency: in search of the estrogen role in human male reproduction |journal=Mol.

In humans, the condition is very rare and only one case has been described.  A reported male with EIS was tall as estrogens were unable to act to close the [[epiphysis|epiphyseal line]], at risk for [[osteoporosis]], and sterile (suggesting that in humans estrogens are necessary for reproduction).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Korach | first1 = KS | last2 = Couse | first2 = JF | last3 = Curtis | first3 = SW | last4 = Washburn | first4 = TF | last5 = Lindzey | first5 = J | last6 = Kimbro | first6 = KS | last7 = Eddy | first7 = EM | last8 = Migliaccio | first8 = S | last9 = Snedeker | first9 = SM | title = Estrogen receptor gene disruption: molecular characterization and experimental and clinical phenotypes | journal = Recent progress in hormone research | volume = 51 | pages = 159–86; discussion 186–8 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8701078 }}</ref>

==ERKO mice==
Estrogen insensitivity syndrome can be experimentally induced in animals, typically mice, by knocking out the estrogen receptor. In so-called ERKO mice different estrogens receptors can be disabled allowing to study the role of such receptors.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1210/er.20.3.358 | last1 = Couse | first1 = JF | last2 = Korach | first2 = KS | title = Estrogen receptor null mice: what have we learned and where will they lead us? | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 358–417 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10368776 }}</ref>  ERKO mice show development of  the respective female or male [[reproductive system]]s, and male and female alpha ERKO mice are infertile, beta ERKO males are fertile while females are subfertile, male and female double alpha and beta ERKO mice are sterile. The [[hypoplastic]] [[uterus]] does not respond to exogenous stimulation by estrogens. Males are [[infertile]] with [[atrophy]] in the [[testes]]. Bones age is delayed and bones are more [[brittle]]. Variations in these patterns can be achieved by selectively disabling the alpha or beta ERs.

==AIS==
In contrast to EIS, the [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (AIS) where the [[androgen receptor]] is defective is relatively common. This can be explained by the genetics of each syndrome. AIS is a [[X-linked recessive]] condition and thus carried over into future generations. EIS is not compatible with reproduction, thus each occurrence in humans would have to be a de-novo [[mutation]] and is not transmitted to offspring.

Congenital estrogen deficiency can also be caused by a defect in the [[aromatase|aromatizing enzyme]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0303-7207(02)00092-8 | last1 = Rochira | first1 = V | last2 = Balestrieri | first2 = A | last3 = Madeo | first3 = B | last4 = Spaggiari | first4 = A | last5 = Carani | first5 = C | title = Congenital estrogen deficiency in men: a new syndrome with different phenotypes; clinical and therapeutic implications in men | journal = Molecular and cellular endocrinology | volume = 193 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 19–28 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12160998 }}</ref>
