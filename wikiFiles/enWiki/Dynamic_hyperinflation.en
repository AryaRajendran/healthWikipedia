'''Dynamic hyperinflation''' is a phenomenon that occurs when a new breath begins before the lung has reached the static equilibrium volume.<ref name="pmid15636649">{{cite journal| author=Blanch L, Bernabé F, Lucangelo U| title=Measurement of air trapping, intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure, and dynamic hyperinflation in mechanically ventilated patients. | journal=[[Respir Care]] | year= 2005 | volume= 50 | issue= 1 | pages= 110-23; discussion 123-4 | pmid=15636649 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref>

Dynamic hyperinflation can occur in patients with [[asthma]] who are breathing spontaneously. It is a physiologic response to airflow obstruction and exists, to an extent, because increasing lung volume tends to increase airway caliber and can reduce the resistive work of breathing. However, in patients with severe asthma it becomes maladaptive, occurring at the expense of increased mechanical load and elastic work of breathing.<ref name="pmid11399724">{{cite journal| author=Werner HA| title=Status asthmaticus in children: a review. | journal=Chest | year= 2001 | volume= 119 | issue= 6 | pages= 1913–29 | pmid=11399724 | doi= 10.1378/chest.119.6.1913| pmc= | url= }}</ref> Dynamic hyperinflation can cause alveolar overdistention resulting in hypoxemia, hypotension, or alveolar rupture. Dynamic hyperinflation increases the magnitude of the drop in airway pressure that the patient must generate to trigger a breath, thereby increasing the patient's workload.

===Status asthmaticus===
{{Main|Status asthmaticus}}
Patients with acute severe asthma exacerbation are at risk for progressive air trapping and alveolar hyperinflation, which may lead to alveolar rupture and hemodynamic compromise. Airflow obstruction during expiration slows lung emptying and inspiration may be initiated before exhalation is complete. The phenomenon that occurs when a new breath begins before the lung has reached the static equilibrium volume is called dynamic hyperinflation.<ref name="pmid15636649"/>

==Interventions==
Interventions to correct air-trapping include decreasing the respiratory rate (increasing expiratory time), increasing inspiratory flow rates (decreasing the inspiratory time) and lowering the [[tidal volume]].<ref name="pmid11940264">{{cite journal| author=Papiris S, Kotanidou A, Malagari K, Roussos C| title=Clinical review: severe asthma. | journal=Crit Care | year= 2002 | volume= 6 | issue= 1 | pages= 30–44 | pmid=11940264 | doi= | pmc=137395 | url= }}</ref>

===Adults===
In adults, it has been demonstrated that limiting minute ventilation is the key to avoiding dynamic hyperinflation; keeping the minute ventilation under 115/mL/kg is recommended<ref name="pmid11940264"/>
