'''Disseminated intravascular coagulation''' ('''DIC'''), also known as '''disseminated intravascular coagulopathy''' or less commonly as '''consumptive coagulopathy''', is a pathological activation of [[coagulation]] (blood clotting) mechanisms that happens in response to a variety of diseases. DIC leads to the formation of small blood clots inside the blood vessels throughout the body.<ref>Churchill Livingstone Pocket Medical Dictionary 14th Edition.</ref> As the small clots consume coagulation proteins and [[platelet]]s, normal coagulation is disrupted and abnormal [[bleeding]] occurs from the skin (e.g. from sites where blood samples were taken), the [[gastrointestinal tract]], the [[respiratory tract]] and surgical wounds. The small clots also disrupt normal blood flow to organs (such as the [[kidney]]s), which may malfunction as a result.<ref name=david>{{cite book|title=Davidson's Principles and Practice of Medicine|edition=19|year=2002|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|isbn=0-443-07036-9}}</ref>{{rp|200}}

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Coagulation full.svg|thumb|400px|The coagulation cascade of secondary hemostasis.]]
Under homeostatic conditions, the body is maintained in a finely tuned balance of coagulation and [[fibrinolysis]]. The activation of the coagulation cascade yields thrombin that converts fibrinogen to fibrin; the stable fibrin clot being the final product of [[hemostasis]]. The fibrinolytic system then functions to break down fibrinogen and fibrin. Activation of the fibrinolytic system generates plasmin (in the presence of thrombin), which is responsible for the lysis of fibrin clots. The breakdown of fibrinogen and fibrin results in polypeptides called fibrin degradation products (FDPs) or fibrin split products (FSPs). In a state of homeostasis, the presence of plasmin is critical, as it is the central proteolytic enzyme of coagulation and is also necessary for the breakdown of clots, or fibrinolysis.

In DIC, the processes of coagulation and fibrinolysis are dysregulated, and the result is widespread clotting with resultant bleeding. Regardless of the triggering event of DIC, once initiated, the pathophysiology of DIC is similar in all conditions. One critical mediator of DIC is the release of a transmembrane glycoprotein called [[tissue factor]] (TF). TF is present on the surface of many cell types (including endothelial cells, macrophages, and monocytes) and is not normally in contact with the general circulation, but is exposed to the circulation after vascular damage. For example, TF is released in response to exposure to cytokines (particularly [[interleukin 1]]), [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|tumor necrosis factor]], and [[endotoxin]].<ref name=Robbins>Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; & Mitchell, Richard N. (2007). ''Robbins Basic Pathology'' (8th ed.). Saunders Elsevier. pp. 469-471 ISBN 978-1-4160-2973-1</ref> This plays a major role in the development of DIC in septic conditions. TF is also abundant in tissues of the lungs, brain, and placenta. This helps to explain why DIC readily develops in patients with extensive trauma. Upon activation, TF binds with coagulation factors which then triggers the extrinsic pathway (via Factor VII) which subsequently triggers the intrinsic pathway (XII to XI to IX) of coagulation.

The release of endotoxin is the mechanism by which [[Gram-negative]] [[sepsis]] provokes DIC. In acute promyelocytic leukemia, treatment causes the destruction of leukemic granulocyte precursors, resulting in the release of large amounts of proteolytic enzymes from their storage granules, causing microvascular damage. Other malignancies may enhance the expression of various oncogenes that result in the release of TF and [[plasminogen activator inhibitor-1]] (PAI-1), which prevents fibrinolysis.<ref name="pmid17108099">{{cite journal |author=Rak J, Yu JL, Luyendyk J, Mackman N |title=Oncogenes, trousseau syndrome, and cancer-related changes in the coagulome of mice and humans |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=66 |issue=22 |pages=10643–6 |year=2006 |pmid=17108099 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2350 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17108099}}</ref>

Excess circulating thrombin results from the excess activation of the coagulation cascade. The excess thrombin cleaves fibrinogen, which ultimately leaves behind multiple fibrin clots in the circulation. These excess clots trap platelets to become larger clots, which leads to microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis. This lodging of clots in the microcirculation, in the large vessels, and in the organs is what leads to the ischemia, impaired organ perfusion, and end-organ damage that occurs with DIC.

Coagulation inhibitors are also consumed in this process. Decreased inhibitor levels will permit more clotting so that a feedback system develops in which increased clotting leads to more clotting. At the same time, thrombocytopenia occurs and this has been attributed to the entrapment and consumption of platelets. Clotting factors are consumed in the development of multiple clots, which contributes to the bleeding seen with DIC.  

Simultaneously, excess circulating thrombin assists in the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, resulting in fibrinolysis. The breakdown of clots results in excess amounts of FDPs, which have powerful anticoagulant properties, contributing to hemorrhage. The excess plasmin also activates the complement and kinin systems. Activation of these systems leads to many of the clinical symptoms that patients experiencing DIC exhibit, such as shock, hypotension, and increased vascular permeability. The acute form of DIC is considered an extreme expression of the intravascular coagulation process with a complete breakdown of the normal homeostatic boundaries. DIC is associated with a poor prognosis and a high mortality rate.

There has been a recent challenge however to the basic assumptions and interpretations of the pathophysiology of DIC.  A study of sepsis and DIC in animal models has shown that a highly-expressed receptor on the surface of hepatocytes, termed the Ashwell-Morell receptor, is responsible for thrombocytopenia in bacteremia and sepsis due to streptococcal pneumoniae (SPN) and possibly other pathogens.  The [[thrombocytopenia]] observed in SPN sepsis was not due to increased consumption of coagulation factors such as platelets, but instead was the result of this receptor's activity enabling hepatocytes to ingest and rapidly clear platelets from circulation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Grewal|first=PK|coauthors=Uchiyama, S; Ditto, D; Varki, N; Le, DT; Nizet, V; Marth, JD|title=The Ashwell receptor mitigates the lethal coagulopathy of sepsis.|journal=Nature medicine|date=2008 Jun|volume=14|issue=6|pages=648–55|pmid=18488037|doi=10.1038/nm1760}}</ref>  By removing pro-thrombotic components before they participate in the coagulopathy of DIC, the Ashwell-Morell receptor lessens the severity of DIC, reducing thrombosis and tissue necrosis, and promoting survival.  The hemorrhage observed in DIC and among some tissues lacking this receptor may thereby be secondary to increased thrombosis with loss of the mechanical vascular barrier.  This discovery has possible significant clinical implications in devising new approaches to reducing the pathophysiology of DIC.

==Signs and symptoms==
The affected person is often acutely ill and shocked with widespread hemorrhage (common bleeding sites are mouth, nose and venipuncture sites), extensive bruising, renal failure and gangrene.<ref name="isbn0-7020-2458-9"/><ref>Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine 6th Edition. Page 650</ref> The onset of DIC can be [[fulminant]], as in endotoxic shock or amniotic fluid embolism, or it may be insidious and chronic, as in cases of carcinomatosis.<ref name="isbn0-7216-7335-X"/>

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is usually suggested by following conditions:<ref name="isbn0-7020-2458-9"/>
* ''Severe cases with hemorrhage:''  The PT and APTT are usually very prolonged and the fibrinogen level markedly reduced.  High levels of fibrin degradation products, including [[D-dimer]], are found owing to the intense fibrinolytic activity stimulated by the presence of fibrin in the circulation.  There is severe thrombocytopenia.  The blood film may show fragmented red blood cells ([[schistocytes]]).
* ''Mild cases without bleeding:''  There is increased synthesis of coagulation factors and platelets.  PT, APTT, and platelet counts are normal.  Fibrin degradation products are raised.

Definitive diagnosis depends on the result of:<ref name=david/>{{rp|953}}
* [[Thrombocytopenia]]
* Prolongation of [[prothrombin time]] and [[activated partial thromboplastin time]]
* A low [[fibrinogen]] concentration
* Increased levels of [[fibrin degradation products]]

==Treatment==
The only effective treatment is the reversal of the underlying cause. [[Anticoagulant]]s are given exceedingly rarely, only when thrombus formation is likely to lead to imminent death (such as in coronary artery thrombosis or cerebrovascular thrombosis). Platelets may be [[Blood transfusion|transfused]] if counts are less than 5,000-10,000/mm<sup>3</sup> and massive hemorrhage is occurring, and [[fresh frozen plasma]] may be administered in an attempt to replenish coagulation factors and anti-thrombotic factors, although these are only temporizing measures and may result in the increased development of thrombosis.

DIC results in lower [[fibrinogen]] levels (as it has all been converted to fibrin), and this can be tested for in the [[medical laboratory|hospital lab]]. A more specific test is for "fibrin split products" (FSPs) or "[[fibrin degradation products]]" (FDPs) which are produced when fibrin undergoes degradation when blood clots are dissolved by [[fibrinolysis]].

In some situations, infusion with [[antithrombin]] may be necessary.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis varies depending on the underlying disorder, and the extent of the intravascular [[thrombosis]] (clotting).  The prognosis for those with DIC, regardless of cause, is often grim:  Between 10% and 50% of patients will die.<ref name=Becker />  DIC with [[sepsis]] (infection) has a significantly higher rate of death than DIC associated with trauma.<ref name=Becker>Becker, Joseph U and Charles R Wira.
