'''Genotyping''' is the process of determining differences in the genetic make-up ([[genotype]]) of an individual by examining the individual's [[DNA]] sequence using [[bioassay|biological assays]] and comparing it to another individual's sequence or a reference sequence. It reveals the [[allele]]s an individual has inherited from their parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=genotyping |title=Genotyping definition|publisher=NIH|date=2011-09-21|accessdate=2011-09-21}}</ref> Traditionally genotyping is the use of DNA sequences to define biological populations by use of molecular tools. It does not usually involve defining the genes of an individual.

Current methods of genotyping include  [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] identification (RFLPI) of genomic DNA, [[RAPD|random amplified polymorphic detection]] (RAPD) of genomic DNA, [[amplified fragment length polymorphism]] detection (AFLPD), [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), [[DNA sequencing]], [[allele specific oligonucleotide]] (ASO) probes, and [[Sequencing by hybridization|hybridization]] to [[DNA microarray]]s or beads.  Genotyping is important in research  of genes and gene variants associated with disease.  Due to current technological limitations, almost all genotyping is partial.  That is, only a small fraction of an individualâ€™s genotype is determined.

Genotyping applies to a broad range of individuals, including microorganisms. For example, [[viruses]] and [[bacteria]] can be genotyped.  Genotyping in this context may help in controlling the spreading of pathogens, by tracing the origin of outbreaks. This area is often referred to as [[molecular epidemiology]] or [[forensic]] [[microbiology]].

Humans can also be genotyped.  For example, when testing fatherhood or motherhood, scientists typically only need to examine 10 or 20 genomic regions (like [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNPs)). That is a tiny fraction of the human [[genome]], which consists of three billion or so [[nucleotide]]s.

When genotyping [[transgenic]] organisms, a single genomic region may be all that needs to be examined to determine the genotype.  A single [[PCR]] assay is typically enough to genotype a transgenic [[mouse]]; the mouse is the [[mammal]]ian model of choice for much of medical research today.
