'''Reproductive medicine''' is a branch of [[medicine]] that deals with prevention, diagnosis and management of [[reproduction|reproductive]] problems; goals include improving or maintaining [[reproductive health]] and allowing people to have children at a time of their choosing. It is founded on knowledge of reproductive [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], and [[endocrinology]], and incorporates relevant aspects of [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]] and [[pathology]].

==Scope==
Reproductive medicine addresses issues of [[sexual education]], [[puberty]], [[family planning]], [[birth control]], [[infertility]], [[reproductive system disease]] (including [[sexually transmitted disease]]s) and [[sexual dysfunction]].  In women, reproductive medicine also covers [[menstruation]], [[ovulation]], [[pregnancy]] and [[menopause]], as well as gynecologic disorders that affect fertility.

The field cooperates with and overlaps mainly with [[reproductive endocrinology and infertility]], [[sexual medicine]] and [[andrology]], but also to some degree with [[gynecology]], [[obstetrics]], [[urology]], [[genitourinary medicine]], medical [[endocrinology]], [[pediatric endocrinology]], [[genetics]], and  [[psychiatry]].

==Methods==
{{See|Reproductive technology|Assisted reproductive technology}}
In the assessment of patients imaging techniques, laboratory methods and [[reproductive surgery]] may be needed. Treatment methods include counseling, pharmacology (e.g. [[fertility medication]]), surgery, and other methods. 

[[In vitro fertilization]] has evolved as a major treatment modality that has enabled the study of the [[embryo]] prior to [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]].

==Education and training==
Specialists in reproductive medicine usually undergo training in [[obstetrics and gynecology]] followed by training in [[reproductive endocrinology and infertility]], or in urology followed by training in [[andrology]]. For reproductive medicine specialists in contraception, other methods of training are possible. Specialists tend to be organized in specialty organizations such as the [[American Society of Reproductive Medicine]] (ASRM) and [[European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology]] (ESHRE).

==Anamnesis==
The [[anamnesis (medicine)|anamnesis]] or medical history taking of issues related to reproductive or [[sexual medicine]] may be inhibited by a reluctance of the patient to disclose intimate or uncomfortable information. Even if such an issue is on the patient's mind, he or she often doesn't start talking about such an issue without the physician initiating the subject by a specific question about sexual or [[reproductive health]].<ref name=Quilliam2011/> Some familiarity with the doctor generally makes it easier for patients to talk about intimate issues such as sexual subjects, but for some patients, a very high degree of familiarity may make the patient reluctant to reveal such intimate issues.<ref name=Quilliam2011/> When visiting a health provider about sexual issues, having both partners of a couple present is often necessary, and is typically a good thing, but may also prevent the disclosure of certain subjects, and, according to one report, increases the stress level.<ref name=Quilliam2011>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/743689_3 'The Cringe Report'] By Susan Quilliam.
