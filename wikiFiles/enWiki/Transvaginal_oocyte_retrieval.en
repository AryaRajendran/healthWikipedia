'''Transvaginal oocyte retrieval''' (TVOR), also referred to as '''oocyte retrieval''' (OCR) or even simply '''egg collection''', is a technique used in [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) in order to remove [[oocyte]]s from the [[ovary]] of the female, enabling [[Fertilisation|fertilization]] outside the body.<ref name=RCN2004>{{cite web|author=|title=Performing ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval: RCN guidance for fertility nurses|work=|publisher=Royal College of Nursing|location=London|year=2004|url=http://www.rcn.org.uk/publications/pdf/ultrasound-guided-oocyte-retrieval.pdf|accessdate=2011-08-01}}</ref> Transvaginal oocyte retrieval is more properly referred to as '''transvaginal ovum retrieval''' when the oocytes have matured into [[ovum|ova]], as is normally the case in IVF.

==Procedure==
Under [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] guidance, the operator inserts a [[Hypodermic needle|needle]] through the vaginal wall and into an [[ovarian follicle]], taking care not to injure organs located between the [[vagina]]l wall and the ovary. The other end of the needle is attached to a [[Aspirator (medical device)|suction device]]. Once the follicle is entered, suction is gently applied to aspirate [[follicular fluid]] and with it, hopefully, cellular material including the oocyte. The follicular fluid is delivered to a technician in the IVF laboratory to identify and quantify the ova. Next, other follicles are aspirated. Once the ovarian follicles have been aspirated on one ovary, the needle is withdrawn, and the procedure repeated on the other ovary. It is not unusual to remove 20 oocytes as women are generally [[Ovarian_hyperstimulation|hyperstimulated]] in advance of this procedure. After completion, the needle is withdrawn, and [[hemostasis]] is achieved. The procedure usually lasts from 20{{ndash}}60 minutes.

Initially performed using [[Abdominal ultrasonography|transabdominal ultrasonography]], TVOR is currently performed with a [[gynecologic ultrasonography|transvaginal ultrasound]] transducer with an attached needle.<ref name=Bates2006>{{cite book|last=Killick|first=S|editor-last=Bates|editor-first=J|title=Practical gynaecological ultrasound|edition=2nd|chapter=Ultrasound and fertility|pages=120–5|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=2006|isbn=9780521674508|url=http://books.google.com/?id=5PV2RWOl42EC&pg=PA123&lpg=PA123&dq=%22Vaginal+ultrasound+is+the+method+of+choice%22#v=onepage&q=%22Vaginal%20ultrasound%20is%20the%20method%20of%20choice%22&f=false}}</ref> TVOR is performed in an [[Operating theater|operating room]] or a physician's office, with the (female) subject in the [[lithotomy position]].

==Timing==
TVOR is typically performed after [[ovarian hyperstimulation]], where oocytes are pharmacologically stimulated to mature. When the ovarian follicles have reached a certain degree of development, [[Ovulation_induction#final maturation|induction of final oocyte maturation]] is performed, generally by an [[intramuscular injection|intramuscular]] or [[subcutaneous injection]] of [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG).<ref name=Stelling2003>{{cite journal|author=Stelling JR, Chapman ET, Frankfurter D, Harris DH, Oskowitz SP, Reindollar RH|title=Subcutaneous versus intramuscular administration of humanchorionicgonadotropin during an in vitro fertilization cycle|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=79|issue=4|pages=881–5|year=2003|pmid=12749424|pmc=|doi=10.1016/S0015-0282(02)04918-X|url=}}</ref> TVOR is typically performed 34{{ndash}}36 hours after hCG injection, when the eggs are fully mature but just prior to [[ovulation|rupture of the follicles]].<ref name=Stelling2003/><ref name=Medscape2004>{{cite web|last=Kovacs|first=P|title=HCG injection after ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate|publisher=Medscape|location=|year=2004|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/473515|accessdate=2011-08-01}}</ref>

==Complications==
Injection of hCG as a trigger for ovulation confers a risk of [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]], especially in women with [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] who have been hyperstimulated during previous assisted reproduction cycles.<ref name=Oyawoye2005>{{cite journal|author=Oyawoye OA, Chander B, Hunter J, Gadir AA|title=Prevention of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome by Early Aspiration of Small Follicles in Hyper-responsive Patients With Polycystic Ovaries During Assisted Reproductive Treatment Cycles|journal=Medscape General Medicine|volume=7|issue=3|pages=60|year=2005|pmc=1681679|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1681679/|pmid=16369286}}</ref>

Complications of TVOR include injury to pelvic organs, [[Bleeding|hemorrhage]], and infection. Occurring more often in lean patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, ovarian hemorrhage after TVOR is a potentially catastrophic and not so rare complication.<ref name=Liberty2008>{{cite journal|author=Liberty G, Hyman JH, Eldar-Geva T, Latinsky B, Gal M, Margalioth EJ|title=Ovarian hemorrhage after transvaginal ultrasonographically guided oocyte aspiration: a potentially catastrophic and not so rare complication among lean patients with polycystic ovary syndrome|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=93|issue=3|pages=874–9|year=2008|pmid=19064264|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.10.028|url=}}</ref> Additional complications may result from the administration of intravenous sedation or general anesthesia. These include [[asphyxia]] caused by [[airway obstruction]], [[apnea]], [[hypotension]], and [[pulmonary aspiration]] of stomach contents.

[[Propofol]]-based anesthetic techniques result in significant concentrations of propofol in follicular fluid. As propofol has been shown to have deleterious effects on oocyte fertilization (in a mouse model), some authors have suggested that the dose of propofol administered during anesthesia should be limited, and also that the retrieved oocytes should be washed free of propofol.<ref name=Christiaens1999>{{cite journal|last=Christiaens|first=F|last2=Janssenswillen|first2=C|last3=Verborgh|first3=C|last4=Moerman|first4=I|last5=Devroey|first5=P|last6=Van Steirteghem|first6=A|last7=Camu|first7=F|title=Propofol concentrations in follicular fluid during general anaesthesia for transvaginal oocyte retrieval|journal=Human Reproduction|volume=14|issue=2|pages=345–8|year=1999|pmid=10099976|pmc=|doi=10.1093/humrep/14.2.345|url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/2/345.full.pdf}}</ref> Anecdotal evidence suggests that certain airborne chemical contaminants and particles, especially [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOC), may be toxic to and impair the [[Embryogenesis|growth and development]] of [[embryo]]s if present in sufficient concentrations in the ambient atmosphere of an IVF [[Incubator (culture)|incubator]].<ref name=Cohen1997>{{cite journal|author=Cohen J, Gilligan A, Esposito W, Schimmel T, Dale B|title=Ambient air and its potential effects on conception in vitro|journal=Human Reproduction|volume=12|issue=8|pages=1742–9|year=1997|pmc=|pmid=9308805|doi=10.1093/humrep/12.8.1742|url=http://www.humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/8/1742.full.pdf}}</ref><ref name=Cohen1998>{{cite journal|author=Cohen J, Gilligan A, Willadsen S|title=Culture and quality control of embryos|journal=Human Reproduction|volume=13|issue=Suppl 3|pages=137–44|year=1998|pmid=|pmc=|doi=10.1093/humrep/13.suppl_3.137|url=http://www.humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/suppl_3/137.full.pdf}}</ref>

This technique was first developed by Pierre Dellenbach and colleagues in [[Strasbourg]], France, in 1984 and introduced into the United States at the [[Genetics and IVF Institute]] in [[Virginia]] in 1985 with the help of Deborah Costakos.<ref name=Schulman1987>{{cite journal|author=Schulman JD, Dorfmann AD, Jones SL, Pitt CC, Joyce B, Patton LA|title=Outpatient in vitro fertilization using transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=69|issue=4|pages=665–8|year=1987|doi=|pmid=3103035|pmc=|url=}}</ref>
