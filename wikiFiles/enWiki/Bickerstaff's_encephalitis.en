'''Bickerstaff's encephalitis''' is a rare [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] disorder of the [[central nervous system]], first described by [[Edwin Bickerstaff]] in 1951.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Bickerstaff ER |year= 1951 |title= Mesencephalitis and rhombencephalitis |journal= Br Med J |volume= 2 |issue= |pages= 77–81 |pmid= 14848512 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.2.4723.77}}</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
In order to diagnose Bickerstaff's encephalitis, [[ataxia]] and [[ophthalmoplegia]] must be present. These are also diagnostic features of [[Miller Fisher syndrome]], and so Bickerstaff's is only diagnosed if other features are present which exclude Miller Fisher syndrome. These may include drowsiness, [[coma]] or [[hyperreflexia]]. When the condition is defined in this way, a number of other features are commonly but not always found: among these are weakness of the limbs, the face, and/or the [[bulbar]] muscles; abnormalities of the pupils; and absent reflexes.<ref name="odaka2003">{{cite journal |author= Odaka M |year= 2003 |title= Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis: clinical features of 62 cases and a subgroup associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome |journal= Brain |publisher= OUP |volume= 126 |issue= 10 |pages= 2279–90 |pmid= 12847079 |doi= 10.1093/brain/awg233}}</ref>

Like some other [[autoimmune disease]]s, the condition usually follows a minor infection, such as a [[respiratory tract infection]] or [[gastroenteritis]].

==Pathophysiology==
The clinical features and course of the condition, the associated auto-antibodies against relevant antigens, and the response to treatment, all suggest that Bickerstaff's encephalitis is an [[autoimmune disease]]. However, each of these criteria fails to fit a substantial proportion of patients, and there is no single test or feature which is diagnostic of Bickerstaff's encephalitis. It is therefore possible that a proportion of cases are due to other causes, such as [[infection]] or [[lymphoma]], but remain undiagnosed. It is also possible that there is more than one autoimmune disease that can cause an illness which would currently be diagnosed as Bickerstaff's. There is certainly overlap between [[Guillain-Barré syndrome]], [[Miller Fisher syndrome]] and Bickerstaff's encephalitis, as well as other conditions associated with [[anti-ganglioside antibodies]] such as chronic ophthalmoplegia with anti-GQ1b antibody.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Reddel SW |year= 2000 |title= Chronic ophthalmoplegia with anti-GQ1b antibody |journal= Neurology |volume= 54 |issue= 4 |pages= 1000 |pmid= 10691005}}</ref>
and the pharyngo-cervico-brachial variant of GBS.

==Diagnosis==
[[Anti-GQ1b]] antibodies are found in two-thirds of patients with this condition. This antibody is also found in almost all cases of Miller Fisher syndrome. The [[EEG]] is often abnormal, but shows only slow wave activity, which also occurs in many other conditions, and so is of limited value in diagnosis. Similarly, raised [[Cerebrospinal_fluid|CSF]] protein levels and [[pleocytosis]] are frequent but non-specific. It was originally thought <ref name="bickerstaff1957"/> that raised CSF protein without pleocytosis ('albuminocytological dissociation') was a characteristic feature, as it is in [[Guillain-Barré syndrome]], but this has not been supported in more recent work.<ref name="odaka2003"/> In only 30% of cases is a [[MRI]] brain scan abnormal. [[Nerve conduction studies]] may show an axonal [[polyneuropathy]].

==Treatment and prognosis==
Most patients reported in the literature have been given treatments suitable for autoimmune neurological diseases, such as [[corticosteroids]], [[plasmapheresis]] and/or [[intravenous immunoglobulin]], and most have made a good recovery.<ref name="odaka2003"/> The condition is too rare for controlled trials to have been undertaken.
