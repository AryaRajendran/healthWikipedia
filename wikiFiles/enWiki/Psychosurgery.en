By the 1970s the standard Freeman-Watts type of operation was very rare, but other forms of psychosurgery, although used on a much smaller scale, survived. Some countries have abandoned psychosurgery altogether; in others, for example the US and the UK, it is only used in a few centres on small numbers of people with [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] or [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD);<ref name="RCPsy">Neurosurgery working group 2000 ''Neurosurgery for mental disorder''.

Psychosurgery is a collaboration between psychiatrists and neurosurgeons. During the operation, which is carried out under a [[general anaesthetic]] and using [[Stereotactic surgery|stereotactic]] methods, a small piece of [[Human brain|brain]] is destroyed or removed. The most common types of psychosurgery in current or recent use are capsulotomy, [[bilateral cingulotomy|cingulotomy]], subcaudate tractotomy and limbic leucotomy. Lesions are made by radiation, thermo-coagulation, freezing or cutting.<ref name="Mashour"/> About a third of patients show significant improvement in their symptoms after operation.<ref name="Mashour"/>
Advances in surgical technique have greatly reduced the incidence of death and serious damage from psychosurgery; the remaining risks include [[seizures]], incontinence, decreased drive and initiative, weight gain, and [[Cognition|cognitive]] and [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] problems.<ref name="Mashour"/>

Currently, interest in the neurosurgical treatment of mental illness is shifting from [[Ablation|ablative]] psychosurgery (where the aim is to destroy brain tissue) to [[deep brain stimulation]] (DBS) where the aim is to stimulate areas of the brain with implanted [[electrode]]s.<ref name="Sachdev">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1097/YCO.0b013e32831c8475 | last1 = Sachdev | first1 = P. | last2 = Chen | first2 = X. | year = 2009 | title = Neurosurgical treatment of mood disorders: traditional psychosurgery and the advent of deep brain stimulation | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Psychiatry | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 25–31 | pmid = 19122531 }}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of psychosurgery}}

===Early psychosurgery===
There is evidence that [[trepanation|trepanning]] (or trephining) &mdash; the practice of drilling holes in the skull &mdash; has been in widespread, if infrequent, use since 5000 BC.<ref name="Mashour"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Feldman|first=RP|coauthors=Goodrich JT.|date=March 2001|journal=Psychosurgery: a historical overview|publisher=|volume=48|issue=3|pages=647–57|pmid=11270556|title=Psychosurgery: a historical overview.}}</ref> This may have been done in an attempt to allow the brain to expand in the case of [[Intracranial pressure|increased brain fluid pressure]], for example, after head injuries. However, psychosurgery as understood today was not commonly practiced until the 1930s.<ref name="berrios 1997">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0957154X9700802905 | last1 = Berrios | first1 = G.E. | year = 1997 | title = The origins of psychosurgery | url = | journal = History of Psychiatry | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 61–82 }}</ref>

The first systematic attempt at human psychosurgery is commonly attributed to the Swiss psychiatrist [[Gottlieb Burckhardt]].<ref>For example,

}}</ref> In December 1888 Burckhardt operated on the brains of six patients (one of whom died a few days after the operation) at the Préfargier Asylum, cutting out a piece of [[cerebral cortex]]. He presented the results at the Berlin Medical Congress and published a report, but the response was hostile and he did no further operations.<ref name="Kotowicz">{{Cite journal | last1 = Kotowicz | first1 = Z. | year = 2005 | title = Gottlieb Burckhardt and Egas Moniz - two beginnings of psychosurgery | url = | journal = Gesnerus | volume = 62 | issue = 1-2| pages = 77–101 | pmid = 16201322 }}</ref>
Early in the 20th century Russian neurologist [[Vladimir Bekhterev]] and Estonian neurosurgeon [[Ludvig Puusepp]] operated on three patients with mental illness, with discouraging results.<ref name="Kotowicz"/>

===1930s-1950s===

But it was the Portuguese neurologist [[Antonio Egas Moniz|Egas Moniz]] who, in 1935, was responsible for introducing psychosurgery into mainstream psychiatric practice, and coined the term "psychosurgery".<ref name="Kotowicz"/> Moniz developed a theory that people with mental illnesses, particularly "obsessive and melancholic cases" had a disorder of the [[synapse]]s which allowed unhealthy thoughts to circulate continuously in their brains. Moniz hoped that by surgically interrupting pathways in their brain he could encourage new healthier synaptic connections.<ref name="Moniz">E. Moniz 1956 How I succeeded in performing the prefrontal leukotomy. In A.M. Sackler ''et al''. (eds.) ''The great physiodynamic therapies in psychiatry; an historical reappraisal''. New York: Hoeber, 131-37</ref> In November 1935, under Moniz's direction, surgeon Pedro Almeida Lima drilled a series of holes on either side of a woman's skull and injected [[ethanol]] to destroy small areas of subcortical white matter in the [[frontal lobe]]s. After a few operations using ethanol, Moniz and Almeida Lima changed their technique and cut out small cores of brain tissue. They designed an instrument which they called a leucotome, and called the operation a [[leucotomy]] (cutting of the white matter).<ref name="Moniz"/> After twenty operations they published an account of their work. The reception was generally not friendly but a few psychiatrists, notably in Italy and the US, were inspired to experiment for themselves.<ref name="Moniz"/>

In the US, psychosurgery was taken up and zealously promoted by neurologist [[Walter Freeman (neurologist)|Walter Freeman]] and neurosurgeon [[James W. Watts|James Watts]].<ref name="Heller">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1227/01.NEU.0000240227.72514.27 | last1 = Heller | first1 = A.C. | last2 = Amar | year = 2006 | first2 = Arun P. | last3 = Liu | first3 = Charles Y. | last4 = Apuzzo | first4 = Michael L.J. | title = Surgery of the mind and mood: a mosaic of issues in time and evolution | url = | journal = Neurosurgery | volume = 59 | issue = 4| pages = 720–40 | pmid=18695579}}</ref> They started a psychosurgery program at [[George Washington University]] in 1936, first using Moniz's method but then devised a method of their own in which the connections between the prefrontal lobes and deeper structures in the brain were severed by making a sweeping cut through a burr hole on either side of the skull.<ref name="Heller"/> They called their new operation a [[lobotomy]].<ref name="Moniz"/>

[[Image:Icepicks1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Orbitoclasts, used in frontal lobotomies]]
Freeman went on to develop a new form of lobotomy which dispensed with the need for a neurosurgeon. He hammered an ice pick-like instrument, an orbitoclast, through the eye socket and swept through the frontal lobes. The transorbital or "ice pick" lobotomy was done under [[local anesthesia]] or using [[electroconvulsive therapy]] to render the patient unconscious and could be performed in mental hospitals lacking surgical facilities.<ref>{{cite book

The 1940s saw a rapid expansion of psychosurgery, in spite of the fact that it involved a significant risk of death<ref name="Tooth">G.C. Tooth and M.P. Newton 1961 ''Leucotomy in England and Wales, 1942-54.''

But psychosurgery went into rapid decline in the 1950s, due to the introduction of new drugs and a growing awareness of the long-term damage caused by the operations,<ref name="Heller"/> as well as doubts about its efficacy.<ref name="Mashour"/>

Beginning in the 1940s various new techniques were designed in the hope of reducing the adverse effects of the operation. These techniques included [[William Beecher Scoville]]'s [[History of psychosurgery in the United Kingdom#Subcaudate tractotomy|orbital undercutting]], Jean Talairach's [[History of psychosurgery in the United Kingdom#Capsulotomy|anterior capsulotomy]], and Hugh Cairn's [[bilateral cingulotomy]].<ref name="Heller"/> Stereotactic techniques made it possible to place [[lesion]]s more accurately, and experiments were done with alternatives to cutting instruments such as radiation.<ref name="Heller"/> By the 1970s the standard or transorbital lobotomy had been replaced with other forms of psychosurgical operations.

===1960s to the present===

During the 1960s and 1970s psychosurgery became the subject of increasing public concern and debate, culminating in the US with congressional hearings.<ref name="Mashour"/> The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in 1977 endorsed the continued limited use of psychosurgical procedures.<ref name="Mashour"/> Since then a few facilities in some countries, such as the US, have continued to use psychosurgery on small numbers of patients. In the US and other Western countries the number of operations has further declined over the past 30 years, a period during which there have been no major advances in ablative psychosurgery.<ref name="Sachdev"/>

==Neurological effects==
The [[frontal lobe]] of the brain controls a number of advanced cognitive functions, as well as motor control. Motor control is located at the rear of the frontal lobe, and is usually unaffected by psychosurgery. The anterior or [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] area is involved in impulse control, judgement with everyday life and situations, language, memory, motor function, problem solving, sexual behaviour, socialization and spontaneity. Frontal lobes assist in planning, coordinating, controlling and executing behaviour.

The efficacy is not high: one study of cingulotomy (which usually involves a 2–3&nbsp;cm lesion in the [[cingulum]] near the [[corpus callosum]]) found improvement in 5 out of 18 patients.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Baer | first1 = L. | year = 1995 | last2 = Rauch | first2 = SL | last3 = Ballantine Jr | first3 = HT | last4 = Martuza | first4 = R | last5 = Cosgrove | first5 = R | last6 = Cassem | first6 = E | last7 = Giriunas | first7 = I | last8 = Manzo | first8 = PA | last9 = Dimino | first9 = C | title = Cingulotomy for intractable obsessive-compulsive disorder | url = | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 52 | issue = 5| pages = 384–392 | pmid = 7726719 }}</ref>

==Present day==

All the forms of psychosurgery in use today (or used in recent years) target the limbic system, which involves structures such as the [[amygdala]], [[hippocampus]], certain [[thalamus|thalamic]] and [[hypothalamic]] nuclei, [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex]], and [[cingulate cortex|cingulate gyrus]] &mdash; all connected by fibre pathways and thought to play a part in the regulation of emotion.<ref name="CRAG">Clinical resource and audit group 1996 ''Neurosurgery for mental disorder''. Edinburgh: Scottish Office</ref> There is no international consensus on the best target site.<ref name="CRAG"/>

'''Anterior cingulotomy''' was first used by [[Hugh Cairns (surgeon)|Hugh Cairns]] in the UK, and developed in the US by H.T. Ballantine jnr.<ref name="Heller"/> In recent decades it has been the most commonly used psychosurgical procedure in the US.<ref name="CRAG"/> The target site is the anterior cingulate cortex; the operation disconnects the thalamic and posterior frontal regions and damages the anterior cingulate region.<ref name="CRAG"/>

'''Anterior capsulotomy''' was developed in Sweden, where it became the most frequently used procedure. It is also used in Scotland. The aim of the operation is to disconnect the orbitofrontal cortex and thalamic nuclei.<ref name="CRAG"/>

'''Subcaudate tractotomy''' was the most commonly used form of psychosurgery in the UK from the 1960s to the 1990s. It targets the lower medial quadrant of the frontal lobes, severing connections between the limbic system and supra-orbital part of the frontal lobe.<ref name="CRAG"/>

'''Limbic leucotomy'''  is a combination of subcaudate tractotomy and anterior cingulotomy. It was used at [[Atkinson Morley Hospital]] London in the 1990s<ref name="CRAG"/> and also at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v62n1202 | last1 = Price | first1 = B.H. | last2 = Baral | year = 2001 | first2 = I | last3 = Cosgrove | first3 = GR | last4 = Rauch | first4 = SL | last5 = Nierenberg | first5 = AA | last6 = Jenike | first6 = MA | last7 = Cassem | first7 = EH | title = Improvement in severe self-mutilation following limbic leucotomy: a series of five consecutive cases | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 62 | issue = 12| pages = 925–32 | pmid = 11780871 }}</ref>

'''Amygdalotomy''', which targets the [[amygdala]], was developed as a treatment for aggression by Hideki Narabayashi in 1961 and is still used occasionally, for example at the [[Medical College of Georgia]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Fountas | first1 = K.N. | last2 = Smith | first2 = J.R. | last3 = Lee | first3 = G.P. | year = 2007 | title = Bilateral stereotactic amygdalotomy for self-mutilation disorder: a case report and review of the literature | url = | journal = Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery | volume = 85 | issue = 2-3| pages = 121–8 | pmid = 17228178 | doi = 10.1159/000098527 }}</ref>
