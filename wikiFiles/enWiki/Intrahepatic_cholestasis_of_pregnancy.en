'''Intrahepatic [[cholestasis]] of pregnancy''', termed '''obstetric cholestasis''' in the [[United Kingdom]], (also known as "cholestasis of pregnancy,"<ref name="Bolognia" /> "jaundice of pregnancy,"<ref name="Bolognia" /> and "prurigo gravidarum"<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>), is a medical condition in which [[cholestasis]] occurs during [[pregnancy]]. It typically presents with troublesome [[itch]]ing<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tunzi M, Gray GR |title=Common skin conditions during pregnancy |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=211–8 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17263216 |doi= |url=}}</ref> and can lead to complications for both mother and fetus.

Itching has long been considered to be a common symptom of pregnancy.  The vast majority of times, itching, or pruritus, is a minor annoyance caused by changes to the skin, especially that of the abdomen.  However, there are instances when itching is a symptom of ICP. This is usually most intense on the palms of the hands, and the soles of the feet, but can be wide spread.

ICP occurs most commonly in the third trimester, but can begin at any time during the pregnancy. It is also the second most common cause of [[jaundice]] in pregnancy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Risks if untreated==
Maternal consequences include the following:
* Itching, which can become intense and debilitating
* Premature labor
* Deranged clotting, which requires Vitamin K

Fetal consequences include:
* Fetal distress
* [[Meconium]] ingestion
* [[Meconium aspiration syndrome]]
* Stillbirth

Delivery has been recommended in the 38th week when lung maturity has been established.<ref name="pusl"/>

==Signs and symptoms==

Most women with this condition present in third trimester with intense itching without a [[rash]]. Generally, the itching is localized to the abdomen, legs, palms, and soles, but can be generalized.

Hallmarks of ICP include the following symptoms:

Most common:
* Itching, in particular but not limited to that of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, without presence of a rash
* Itching that increases in the evening
* Itching that does not respond favorably to [[anti-histamine]]s or other anti-itch remedies
* Often, elevated [[LFT]] results as well as [[serum bile acid]] counts

Less common:
* Darker urine
* Lighter stools
* Increased clotting time (due to possibly associated vitamin K deficiency)
* Fatigue
* Increased nausea
* Decrease in appetite
* Jaundice
* Upper right quadrant pain

It is important to note that not all ICP sufferers have all of the above symptoms.  For example, Jaundice only occurs in relatively small subset of cases, and in some cases abnormal lab results were not seen until 15 weeks or more after the onset of symptoms.

==Mechanism==
The causes of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy are still not fully understood.<ref name="pusl">{{cite journal |author=Pusl T, Beuers U |title=Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy |journal=Orphanet J Rare Dis |volume=2 |issue= |pages=26 |year=2007 |pmid=17535422 |pmc=1891276 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-2-26}}</ref> [[Sex steroid|Hormones]] and [[Genetics|genetic factors]] are likely to be important in the [[pathogenesis]] of the disease.<ref name="lammert">{{cite journal |author=Lammert F, Marschall HU, Glantz A, Matern S |title=Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy: molecular pathogenesis, diagnosis and management |journal=J.

* ICP occurs in the [[Pregnancy#Third trimester|third trimester]] at the time when hormone levels are at their highest.
* [[Multiple birth|Twin and triplet pregnancies]], which are associated with higher hormone levels, show a higher incidence of ICP.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gonzalez MC, Reyes H, Arrese M, ''et al.'' |title=Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy in twin pregnancies |journal=J.

* ICP resolves quickly after delivery, when [[Placenta|placental hormone]] production ceases.
* Older high-dose estrogen [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptive pills]] could cause features of ICP.

===Estrogens===
Estrogens, and particularly [[glucuronide]]s such as estradiol-17β-D-glucuronide, have been shown to cause cholestasis in animal studies, by reducing [[bile acid]] uptake by [[hepatocyte]]s.<ref name="reyes">{{cite journal |author=Reyes H, Sjövall J |title=Bile acids and progesterone metabolites in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy |journal=Ann. Med. |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=94–106 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10766400 |doi=10.3109/07853890009011758}}</ref>

===Progesterone===
Treatment with progesterone in the third trimester of pregnancy has been shown to be associated with the development of ICP, and levels of metabolites of progesterone, particularly [[sulfate]]d progesterone, are higher in patients with ICP than unaffected women, suggesting that progesterone also has a role in ICP.<ref name="lammert"/>

===Genetic factors===
Clustering of cases of ICP in families, geographic variation in rates of ICP, and recurrence of ICP in 45-70% of subsequent pregnancies all suggest a genetic component to the disease.<ref name="lammert"/> Genetic mutations in the hepatocellular [[Membrane transport protein|transport protein]] [[ABCB4|ABCB4 (MDR3)]], which controls secretion of [[phosphatidylcholine]] into bile, have been found in 15% of cases of ICP.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jacquemin E, Cresteil D, Manouvrier S, Boute O, Hadchouel M |title=Heterozygous non-sense mutation of the MDR3 gene in familial intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy |journal=Lancet |volume=353 |issue=9148 |pages=210–1 |year=1999 |month=January |pmid=9923886 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)77221-4 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(05)77221-4 |accessdate=2009-10-23}}</ref>

Genetic mutations affecting hepatic bile salt transport molecules have also been found in patients with [[progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis]] (PFIC). It has been found that mothers of patients with PFIC have a higher incidence of ICP, suggesting that [[Zygosity#Heterozygous|heterozygote]] carriers of these mutations are also predisposed to ICP.<ref name="lammert"/>

In addition to genetic changes to bile salt transport molecules, high levels of estrogen glucuronides have been shown to inhibit the bile salt export pump (BSEP) [[ABCB11]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stieger B, Fattinger K, Madon J, Kullak-Ublick GA, Meier PJ. |title=Drug- and estrogen-induced cholestasis through inhibition of the hepatocellular bile salt export pump (Bsep) of rat liver |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=118 |issue=2 |pages=422–30 |year=2000 |pmid=10648470 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016508500987523 |accessdate=2009-10-23 |doi=10.1016/S0016-5085(00)70224-1}}</ref> and high levels of progesterone to inhibit the ABCB4 (MDR3) phospholipid transporter.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Debry P, Nash EA, Neklason DW, Metherall JE |title=Role of multidrug resistance P-glycoproteins in cholesterol esterification |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=272 |issue=2 |pages=1026–31 |year=1997 |month=January |pmid=8995398 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8995398 |accessdate=2009-10-23 |doi=10.1074/jbc.272.2.1026}}</ref>

Consequently, both genetic mutations in hepatocyte proteins involved in bile secretion together with inhibition of those proteins by high levels of hormone metabolites in pregnancy may have roles in the pathogenesis of ICP.<ref name="pusl"/>

===Environmental factors===
A number of features of ICP suggest that environmental factors also have a role in the disease:
* It has been reported that the incidence of ICP is higher in winter than summer in Sweden, Finland and Chile.
* The incidence of ICP in Chile has dropped from 14% of pregnancies before 1975 to less than 2% in 1997.<ref name="pusl"/>
* ICP recurs in between 45% and 70% of subsequent pregnancies.
* Low serum [[selenium]] levels have been linked to ICP,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kauppila A, Korpela H, Mäkilä UM, Yrjänheikki E |title=Low serum selenium concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy |journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) |volume=294 |issue=6565 |pages=150–2 |year=1987 |month=January |pmid=3109544 |pmc=1245162 |doi=10.1136/bmj.294.6565.150}}</ref> although the role of selenium in bile secretion is not known.

==Diagnosis==
While most pregnant women experience some itch from time to time, itching on the palms and soles without a visible rash, or persisting severe or extensive itch symptoms should be reported to the midwife or obstetrican.

To obtain a diagnosis of ICP, there are two LFT and Serum bile acid test. The [[liver function tests]] (LFTs) is a simple blood test, the results of which should be available by the next day.  If the [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]] level is elevated, this, plus [[pruritus]] of palms and soles, should be treated as diagnostic of ICP (however LFT's are not always elevated in ICP patients).  The serum bile acid blood test for ICP is a quantitative measurement of bile salts.  The results of this test often take longer to return, but the test is more specific for ICP.

Other problems with the liver that occur in pregnancy should be considered by the treating clinician.  These include preeclampsia, the HELLP syndrome, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy.  Furthermore, other causes of hepatitis, like hepatitis viruses and certain medications, should also be considered.

==Treatment==
Upon diagnosis, most providers will prescribe [[ursodeoxycholic acid|Ursodeoxycholic Acid]]. While there is no cure for ICP, and no way to guarantee a successful outcome, studies have shown a slightly better fetal and maternal outcome from administration of Ursodeoxycholic Acid, whereas Cholestyramine appears to only relieve itching.<ref name="reyes"/>

If additional blood tests to check clotting function identify a problem, giving [[Vitamin K]] may help avoid the risk of hemorrhage at delivery.

Delivery by 37 completed weeks is considered crucial to fetal outcome,<ref>Fagen EA, "Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy," BMJ 1994;309:1243-1244 (12 November)</ref> though it does not completely eliminate the risks associated with the condition.
