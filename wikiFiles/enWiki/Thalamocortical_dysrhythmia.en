'''Thalamocortical Dysrhythmia (TCD)''' is a theoretical framework in which neuroscientists try to explain the positive and negative symptoms induced by neurological disorders like [[Parkinsons|Parkinson's Disease]], [[Pain and nociception|neurogenic pain]], [[Tinnitus]], [[Epilepsy]] as well as neuropsychiatric disorders like [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].<br>
In TCD, normal [[Recurrent_thalamo-cortical_resonance|thalamocortical resonance]] is disrupted by changes in the behaviour of [[neurons]] in the thalamus.<br>
TCD can be treated with [[neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] methods like the central lateral [[thalamotomy]], which due to its invasiveness is only used on patients that have proven resistant to conventional therapies.

==Background==
At the base of the theory lies diminished excitatory or increased inhibitory input at the thalamic level. This leads to a switch of the thalamocortical neurons from tonic to burst firing and subsequently entrains thalamic and cortical areas with pathological oscillations at around 5&nbsp;Hz.

==Evidence==
Evidence for TCD comes from [[Magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), and [[Electroencephalography]] (EEG) recordings on the scalp as well as [[local field potential]] (LFP) recordings in the patients' thalamus during surgery. Analysing the power spectra reveals increased coherence as well as increased bicoherence in the power spectra in the [[Theta rhythm|theta band]] compared to healthy controls. This indicates a close coupling of cortex and thalamus in the generation of the pathological [[theta rhythm]]icity.

==Therapy==
While it is not clear how this happens in detail, surgical intervention by means of lesioning small parts of the central lateral thalamic areas has proven successful as a therapy for Parkinson's Disease as well as neurogenic pain. 

Neurofeedback, where the brain is trained to emphasise and de-emphasise brain wave frequencies, amplitudes and coherence can be an effective non invasive therapy.
