The mainstay of '''management of [[borderline personality disorder]]''' is various forms of [[psychotherapy]] with medications being found to be of little use.

==Psychotherapy==
There has traditionally been skepticism about the psychological treatment of [[personality disorders]], but several specific types of [[psychotherapy]] for BPD have developed in recent years. The limited studies to date do not allow confident claims of effectiveness but do suggest that people with BPD can benefit on at least some outcome measures.<ref name=Cochranepsychotherapy>{{cite journal |author=Binks CA, Fenton M, McCarthy L, Lee T, Adams CE, Duggan C |title=Psychological therapies for people with borderline personality disorder |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD005652 |year=2006 |pmid=16437534 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005652 |url=http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab005652.html |editor1-last=Binks |editor1-first=Claire}}</ref> Supportive therapy alone may enhance self-esteem and mobilize the existing strengths of individuals with BPD.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aviram RB, Hellerstein DJ, Gerson J, Stanley B |title=Adapting supportive psychotherapy for individuals with Borderline personality disorder who self-injure or attempt suicide |journal=J Psychiatr Pract |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=145–55 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15330220 |doi= 10.1097/00131746-200405000-00002|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1527-4160&volume=10&issue=3&spage=145}}</ref> Specific psychotherapies may involve sessions over several months or, as is particularly common for personality disorders, several years.

===Dialectical behavioral therapy===
University of Washington psychology professor [[Marsha Linehan]] is credited with developing the first empirically supported standard treatment for BPD, termed [[dialectical behavioral therapy]] (DBT). DBT grew dramatically in popularity among mental health professionals following the publication of Linehan’s treatment manuals for DBT in 1993. DBT was originally developed as an intervention for patients who meet criteria for BPD and particularly those who are highly suicidal.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Koerner K, Linehan MM |title=Research on dialectical behavior therapy for patients with borderline personality disorder |journal=Psychiatr Clin North Am. |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=151–67 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10729937 |doi= 10.1016/S0193-953X(05)70149-0|url=}}</ref>

DBT draws its principles from behavioral science (including [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral techniques]]), dialectical philosophy and [[Zen]] practice. The treatment emphasizes balancing acceptance and change (hence [[dialectic]]), with the overall goal of helping patients not just survive but build a life worth living. Treatment is delivered in four stages, with self-harm and other life-threatening issues taking priority. In the second stage, patients are encouraged to experience the painful emotions that they have been avoiding. Stage three addresses problems of living such as career and marital problems. Finally, stage four focuses on helping clients feel complete and reducing feelings of emptiness and boredom.

DBT encompasses four modes of therapy:

* The first mode is traditional individual therapy between a single therapist and client.

* The second mode of therapy is skills training; a core component of DBT is learning new behavioral skills, including [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]], interpersonal effectiveness (e.g. [[assertiveness]] and [[social skill]]), coping adaptively with distress and crises, and identifying and regulating emotional reactions.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Holmes Paul, Georgescu Sandra, Liles Wendy | year = 2005 | title = Further Delineating the Applicability of Acceptance and Change to Private Responses: The Example of Dialectical Behavior Therapy | url = | journal = The Behavior Analyst Today | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 301–315 }}</ref>

* The third mode of therapy used is skills generalization, which focuses on helping clients integrate the skills taught in DBT into real-life situations.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sampl S. Wakai, Trestman R., Keeney E.M. | year = 2008 | title = Functional Analysis of Behavior in Corrections: Empowering Inmates in Skills Training Groups | url = | journal = Journal of Behavior Analysis of Offender and Victim: Treatment and Prevention | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 42–51 }}</ref> This usually involves coaching in the form of telephone contact outside of normal therapy hours. The calls are usually brief interactions focused on helping clients apply specific skills to circumstances they are experiencing.

* The fourth mode of therapy is the use of a consultation team designed to support the therapists. These teams have several important functions including reducing therapist burnout, providing therapy for the therapists, improving empathy for clients and providing ongoing consultations for client difficulties.

The goal of all DBT treatment approaches is to reduce the ineffective action tendencies linked to dysregulated emotions. DBT is based on a biosocial theory of personality functioning in which the core problem is seen as the breakdown of the patient’s cognitive, behavioral and emotional regulation systems when experiencing intense emotions. The etiology of BPD is seen as a biological predisposition toward emotional dysregulation combined with a perceived invalidating social environment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lynch TR, Trost WT, Salsman N, Linehan MM |title=Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Borderline Personality Disorder |journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology |year=2007 |pages=181–205 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095229 |doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095229 |volume=3 |pmid=17716053}}</ref>

DBT can be based on a biosocial theory of personality functioning in which BPD is seen as a biological disorder of emotional regulation in a social environment experienced as invalidating by the borderline patient.<ref name=promising>Murphy, E.

Several random controlled trials (RCTs) comparing DBT to other forms of cognitive-behavioral treatments have favored the use of DBT to treat borderline patients. Specifically, DBT has been found to significantly reduce self-injury, suicidal behavior, impulsivity, self-rated anger and the use of crisis services among borderline patients. These reductions have been found even when controlling for other treatment factors such as therapist experience, affordability of treatment, gender of therapist and the number of hours spent in individual therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Verheul R, Van Den Bosch LM, Koeter MW, De Ridder MA, Stijnen T, Van Den Brink W |title=Dialectical behaviour therapy for women with borderline personality disorder: 12-month, randomised clinical trial in The Netherlands |journal=Br J Psychiatry. |volume=182 |issue= 2|pages=135–40 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12562741 |doi= 10.1192/bjp.182.2.135|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12562741}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Linehan MM, Comtois KA, Murray AM, ''et al.'' |title=Two-year randomized controlled trial and follow-up of dialectical behavior therapy vs therapy by experts for suicidal behaviors and borderline personality disorder |journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry. |volume=63 |issue=7 |pages=757–66 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16818865 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.7.757 |url=}}</ref> In a Meta-Analysis where found that DBT reached moderate effects.<ref>Öst, L.

===Schema therapy===
Schema therapy (also called schema-focused therapy) is an integrative approach based on cognitive-behavioral or skills-based techniques along with [[Object relations theory|object relations]] and [[Gestalt therapy|gestalt approaches]]. It directly targets deeper aspects of emotion, personality and [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] (fundamental ways of categorizing and reacting to the world). The treatment also focuses on the [[Transference|relationship with the therapist]] (including a process of "limited re-parenting"), daily life outside of therapy and traumatic childhood experiences. It was developed by [[Jeffrey Young]] and became established in the 1990s. Limited recent research suggests it is significantly more effective than transference-focused psychotherapy, with half of individuals with borderline personality disorder assessed as having achieved full recovery after four years, with two-thirds showing clinically significant improvement.<ref name="SFTvsTFT">{{cite journal |author=Giesen-Bloo J, van Dyck R, Spinhoven P, ''et al.'' |title=Outpatient psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder: randomized trial of schema-focused therapy vs transference-focused psychotherapy |journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry. |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=649–58 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16754838 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.6.649 |url=}}</ref><ref>Darden, M.

===Cognitive behavioral therapy===
[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is the most widely used and established psychological treatment for mental disorders, but has appeared less successful in BPD, due partly to difficulties in developing a therapeutic relationship and treatment adherence. Approaches such as DBT and Schema-focused therapy developed partly as an attempt to expand and add to traditional CBT, which uses a limited number of sessions to target specific maladaptive patterns of thought, perception and behavior. A recent study did find a number of sustained benefits of CBT, in addition to treatment as usual, after an average of 16 sessions over one year.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davidson K, Norrie J, Tyrer P, ''et al.'' |title=THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY FOR BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER: RESULTS FROM THE BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER STUDY OF COGNITIVE THERAPY (BOSCOT) TRIAL |journal=J Personal Disord. |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=450–65 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17032158 |pmc=1852259 |doi=10.1521/pedi.2006.20.5.450 |url=}}</ref>

===Psychoanalysis===
It is in the apparition of the DSM-IV that the term took two orientations: psychiatric one behavioral and the other, included in a psychoanalytical psychopathology. According to this split, the diagnosis takes on, or a character objectivizing with ascendancy of symptoms to be eradicated or it indicates a particular type of patients of psychoanalysts to treat in modalities different from those typical cures.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Harold Searles|Searles, Harold F.]] |title=My Work With Borderline Patients (Master Work) |publisher=Jason Aronson |location=Northvale, N.J. |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=1-56821-401-4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Steiner, John F. |title=Psychic retreats: pathological organizations in psychotic, neurotic and borderline patients |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-415-09924-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bateman A, Fonagy P |title=Treatment of borderline personality disorder with psychoanalytically oriented partial hospitalization: an 18-month follow-up |journal=Am J Psychiatry. |volume=158 |issue=1 |pages=36–42 |year=2001 |month=January |pmid=11136631 |doi= 10.1176/appi.ajp.158.1.36|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11136631}}</ref>

===Psychodynamic Psychotherapy generally===
Psychodynamic psychotherapy (PP) are different typs of psychotherapy, derived from [[psychoanalysis]]. The duration of psychodynamic psychotherapy is very different. It reaches from 10 - 25 sessions (short term psychodynamic psychotherapy) up to over 200 sessions. The main emphasis of these measures, are very different. Similarity treatment principes are mainly, the focus of one or several target problems, by using the foundation of modern psychoanalytical theories. Results of meta-analysis show, that psychodynamic psychotherapy reaches large effects in the treatment of personality disorders. The results let assumed that psychodynamic psychotherapy's rather causes long term changes in personality disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Falk Leichsenring and Eric Leibing |title=The Effectiveness of Psychodynamic Therapy and Cognitive Behavior Therapy in the Treatment of Personality Disorders: A Meta-Analysis |journal=Am J Psychiatry. |volume=160 |issue=7 |pages=1223–1232 |year=2003 |month=Juli |pmid=12832233 |url= http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/160/7/1223}}</ref>

===Transference-focused psychotherapy===
{{further|Otto F. Kernberg#Transference-Focused Psychotherapy}}
Transference-focused psychotherapy (TFP) is a form of psychoanalytic therapy dating to the 1960s, rooted in the conceptions of [[Otto Kernberg]] on BPD and its underlying structure (borderline personality organization). Unlike in the case of traditional psychoanalysis, the therapist plays a very active role in TFP. In session the therapist works on the relationship between the patient and the therapist. The main focus is on the patient's emotions concerning their relationship with the therapist and the therapist's use of psychodynamic techniques (e.g., interpretation).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Biskin, R.S., & Paris, J. |title=Management of borderline personality disorder |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal. |volume=184 |number=17 |pages=1897-1902 |year=2012 |month=November}}</ref> The therapist will try to explore and clarify aspects of this relationship so the underlying [[object relations]] dyads become clear. Some limited research on TFP suggests it may reduce some symptoms of BPD by affecting certain underlying processes,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Levy KN, Clarkin JF, Yeomans FE, Scott LN, Wasserman RH, Kernberg OF |title=The mechanisms of change in the treatment of borderline personality disorder with transference focused psychotherapy |journal=J Clin Psychol. |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=481–501 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16470612 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20239 |url=}}</ref> and that TFP in comparison to [[dialectical behavioral therapy]] and supportive therapy results in increased reflective functioning (the ability to realistically think about how others think) and a more secure [[Attachment theory|attachment style]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Levy KN, Meehan KB, Kelly KM, ''et al.'' |title=Change in attachment patterns and reflective function in a randomized control trial of transference-focused psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol. |volume=74 |issue=6 |pages=1027–40 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17154733 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.74.6.1027 |url=}}</ref>  Furthermore, TFP has been shown to be as effective as DBT in improvement of suicidal behavior, and has been more effective than DBT in alleviating anger and in reducing verbal or direct assaultive behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clarkin JF, Levy KN, Lenzenweger MF, Kernberg OF |title=Evaluating three treatments for borderline personality disorder: a multiwave study |journal=Am J Psychiatry. |volume=164 |issue=6 |pages=922–8 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17541052 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.164.6.922 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/164/6/922}}</ref> Limited research suggests that TFP appears to be less effective than schema-focused therapy, while being more effective than no treatment.<ref name=SFTvsTFT/>

===Cognitive analytic therapy===
[[Cognitive analytic therapy]] (CAT) combines cognitive and psychoanalytic approaches and has been adapted for use with individuals with BPD with mixed results.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ryle A |title=The contribution of cognitive analytic therapy to the treatment of borderline personality disorder |journal=J Personal Disord |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=3–35 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=15061342 |doi=10.1521/pedi.18.1.3.32773 }}</ref>

===Mentalization based treatment===
[[Mentalization based treatment]], developed by Peter Fonagy and Antony Bateman, rests on the assumption that people with BPD have a disturbance of [[Attachment theory|attachment]] due to problems in the early childhood parent-child relationship.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fonagy P, Gergely G, Target M |title=The parent-infant dyad and the construction of the subjective self |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry. |volume=48 |issue=3–4 |pages=288–328 |year=2007 |pmid=17355400 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01727.x |url=}}
</ref>  Fonagy and Bateman hypothesize that inadequate parental mirroring and attunement in early childhood lead to a deficit in mentalization, "the capacity to think about mental states as separate from, yet potentially causing actions";<ref>Bateman A and Fonagy P (2004) Psychotherapy for Borderline Personality Disorder: Mentalization based treatment. Oxford University Press p. 71</ref> in other words the capacity to intuitively understand the thoughts, intentions and motivations of others, and the connections between one's own thoughts, feelings and actions.

===Marital or family therapy===
Marital therapy can be helpful in stabilizing the marital relationship and in reducing marital conflict and stress that can worsen BPD symptoms. [[Family therapy]] or family [[psychoeducation]] can help educate family members regarding BPD, improve family communication and problem solving, and provide support to family members in dealing with their loved one's illness.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Two patterns of family involvement can help clinicians plan family interventions: overinvolvement and neglect. Borderline patients who are from overinvolved families are often actively struggling with a dependency issue by denial or by anger at their parents.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Interest in the use of psychoeducation and skills training approaches for families with borderline members is growing.<ref name=AMN/>

==Medication==
The UK's [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) in 2009 recommends against the use of medication for treating borderline personality disorder and that they should only be considered for comorbid conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG78/NiceGuidance/pdf/English |title=CG78 Borderline personality disorder (BPD): NICE guideline |publisher=Nice.org.uk |date=28 January 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2009}}</ref>  A [[Cochrane review]] from 2006 arrived at the same conclusion.<ref name=Cochranepharm>{{cite journal |author=Binks CA, Fenton M, McCarthy L, Lee T, Adams CE, Duggan C |title=Pharmacological interventions for people with borderline personality disorder |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev. |issue=1 |pages=CD005653 |year=2006 |pmid=16437535 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005653 |url=http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab005653.html |editor1-last=Binks |editor1-first=Claire}}</ref>

===Antidepressants===
[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) [[antidepressant]]s have been shown in [[randomized controlled trials]] to improve the attendant symptoms of anxiety and depression, such as anger and hostility, associated with BPD in some patients.<ref name="Cochranepharm"/> According to ''[[Listening to Prozac]]'', it takes a higher dose of an SSRI to treat mood disorders associated with BPD than depression alone. It also takes about three months for benefit to appear, compared to the three to six weeks for depression.

===Antipsychotics===
The newer [[atypical antipsychotics]] are claimed to have an improved [[adverse effect]] profile than the [[typical antipsychotics]]. Antipsychotics are also sometimes used to treat distortions in thinking or false perceptions.{{Dead link|date=July 2008}}<ref>Siever, L.J.; H.W. Koenigsberg (2000).

Particular difficulties have been observed in the relationship between care providers and individuals diagnosed with BPD. A majority of psychiatric staff report finding individuals with BPD moderately to extremely difficult to work with, and more difficult than other client groups.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cleary M., Siegfried N., Walter G. | year = 2002 | title = Experience, knowledge and attitudes of mental health staff regarding clients with a borderline personality disorder | url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/ano/2002/00000011/00000003/art00007 | journal = Australian and New Zealand Journal of Ophthalmology | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 186–191 | doi=10.1046/j.1440-0979.2002.00246.x}}</ref> On the other hand, those with the diagnosis of BPD have reported that the term "BPD" felt like a [[pejorative]] [[labeling theory|label]] rather than a helpful diagnosis, that self-destructive behaviour was incorrectly perceived as manipulative, and that they had limited access to care.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nehls N | year = 1999 | title = Borderline personality disorder: the voice of patients | url = http://ebmh.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/3/1/32#R1 | journal = Res Nurs Health | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 285–93 }}</ref> Attempts are made to improve public and staff attitudes.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Deans C., Meocevic E. | year = | title = Attitudes of registered psychiatric nurses towards patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder | url = http://www.contemporarynurse.com/21.1/21.1.7.html | journal = Contemporary Nurse | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 1–7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Krawitz R | year = 2004 | title = Borderline personality disorder: attitudinal change following training | url = http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-1614.2004.01409.x?journalCode=anp | journal = Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 38 | issue = 7| page = 554 | doi=10.1111/j.1440-1614.2004.01409.x}}</ref>

===Combining pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy===
In practice, psychotherapy and medication may often be combined, but there are limited data on clinical practice.<ref name=APAguide>(2001). "[http://www.psych.org/psych_pract/treatg/pg/BPD_05-15-06.pdf Treatment of Patients With Borderline Personality Disorder]". ''APA Practice Guidelines''. Retrieved on 21 September 2007.</ref> Efficacy studies often assess the effectiveness of interventions when added to "treatment as usual" (TAU), which may involve general psychiatric services, supportive counselling, medication and psychotherapy.

One small study, which excluded individuals with a comorbid Axis 1 disorder, has indicated that outpatients undergoing [[Dialectical Behavioral Therapy]] and taking the antipsychotic [[Olanzapine]] show significantly more improvement on some measures related to BPD, compared to those undergoing DBT and taking a [[placebo]] pill,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Soler J, Pascual JC, Campins J, ''et al.'' |title=Double-blind, placebo-controlled study of dialectical behavior therapy plus olanzapine for borderline personality disorder |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=162 |issue=6 |pages=1221–4 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15930077 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.6.1221 |url=}}</ref> although they also experienced weight gain and raised [[cholesterol]]. Another small study found that patients who had undergone DBT and then took fluoxetine ([[Prozac]]) showed no significant improvements, whereas those who underwent DBT and then took a placebo pill did show significant improvements.<ref name=dbtfluox>{{cite journal |author=Simpson EB, Yen S, Costello E, ''et al.'' |title=Combined dialectical behavior therapy and fluoxetine in the treatment of borderline personality disorder |journal=J Clin Psychiatry. |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=379–85 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15096078 |doi= 10.4088/JCP.v65n0314|url=http://article.psychiatrist.com/?ContentType=START&ID=10000790}}</ref>

===Difficulties in therapy===
There can be unique challenges in the treatment of BPD, such as hospital care.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kaplan CA |title=The challenge of working with patients diagnosed as having a borderline personality disorder |journal=Nurs Clin North Am |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=429–38 |year=1986 |month=September |pmid=3638699 }}</ref> In psychotherapy, a client may be unusually sensitive to rejection and abandonment and may react negatively (e.g., by harming themselves or withdrawing from treatment) if they sense this. In addition, clinicians may emotionally distance themselves from individuals with BPD for self-protection or due to the [[Social stigma|stigma]] associated with the diagnosis, leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy and a cycle of stigmatization to which both patient and therapist can contribute.<ref>Aviram, R.B.; B.S. Brodsky, B. Stanley (October 2006). "[http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/content/g886500785w755g6/ Borderline Personality Disorder, Stigma, and Treatment Implications]". ''Harvard Review of Psychiatry'' '''14''' (5). Retrieved on 23 September 2007.</ref>

Some psychotherapies, including DBT, were developed partly to overcome problems with interpersonal sensitivity and maintaining a therapeutic relationship. Adherence to medication regimens is also a problem, due in part to [[adverse effects]], with drop-out rates of between 50 percent and 88 percent in medication trials.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Gabbard, G. O.|title=Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with borderline personality disorder. American Psychiatric Association |journal=Am J Psychiatry. |volume=158 |issue=10 Suppl |pages=1–52 |year=2001 |month=October |pmid=11665545 |doi= 10.1176/appi.ajp.158.1.1 |author1= American Psychiatric Association Practice Guidelines }}</ref> Comorbid disorders, particularly substance use disorders, can complicate attempts to achieve remission.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zanarini MC, Frankenburg FR, Hennen J, Reich DB, Silk KR |title=Axis I comorbidity in patients with borderline personality disorder: 6-year follow-up and prediction of time to remission |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=161 |issue=11 |pages=2108–14 |year=2004 |month=November |pmid=15514413 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.11.2108 |url=}}</ref>

===Other strategies===
Psychotherapies and medications form a part of the overall context of mental health services and psychosocial needs related to BPD. The evidence base is limited for both, and some individuals may forego them or not benefit (enough) from them. It has been argued that diagnostic categorization can have limited utility in directing therapeutic work in this area, and that in some cases it is only with reference to past and current relationships that "borderline" behavior can be understood as partly adaptive and how people can best be helped.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Warner S., Wilkins T. | year = 2004 | title = Between Subjugation and Survival: Women, Borderline Personality Disorder and High Security Mental Hospitals | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/l440244686765312/ | journal = Journal of Contemporary Psychotherapy | volume = 34 | issue = 3| pages = 1573–3564 }}</ref>

Numerous other strategies may be used, including [[alternative medicine]] techniques (see [[List of branches of alternative medicine]]); exercise and physical fitness, including team sports; occupational therapy techniques, including creative arts; having structure and routine to the days, particularly through employment - helping feelings of competence (e.g. [[self-efficacy]]), having a social role and being valued by others, boosting [[self-esteem]].{{Verify credibility|date=June 2008}}<ref>Flory, L. (2004). ''[http://www.mind.org.uk/help/diagnoses_and_conditions/borderline_personality_disorder Understanding borderline personality disorder]''. London: Mind. Retrieved on 23 September 2007.</ref>

Group-based psychological services encourage clients to socialize and participate in both solitary and group activities. These may be in day centers. [[Therapeutic communities]] are an example of this, particularly in Europe; although their usage has declined many have specialised in the treatment of [[severe personality disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Campling P | year = 2001 | title = Therapeutic communities | url = http://apt.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/7/5/365 | journal = Advances in Psychiatric Treatment | volume = 7 | issue = 5| pages = 365–372 }}</ref>

[[Psychiatric rehabilitation]] services aimed at helping people with mental health problems reduce [[psychosocial]] disability, engage in meaningful activities and avoid [[Social stigma|stigma]] and [[social exclusion]] may be of value to people who suffer from BPD. There are also many mutual-support or co-counseling groups run by and for individuals with BPD. Services, or individual goals, are increasingly based on a [[recovery model]] that supports and emphasizes an individual's personal journey and potential.<ref>Michael T. Compton (2007) [http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/565489 Recovery: Patients, Families, Communities] Conference Report, Medscape Psychiatry & Mental Health, October 11–14, 2007</ref>

Data indicate that the diagnosis of BPD is more variable over time than the DSM implies. Substantial percentages (for example around a third, depending on criteria) of people diagnosed with BPD achieve [[remission (medicine)|remission]] within a year or two.<ref name="PToverview">Oldham, J. (July 2004). "[http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/p040743.html Borderline Personality Disorder: An Overview]" ''Psychiatric Times'' '''XXI''' (8). Retrieved on 21 September 2007.</ref> A longitudinal study found that, six years after being diagnosed with BPD, 56 percent showed good psychosocial functioning, compared to 26 percent at baseline. Although vocational achievement was more limited even compared to those with other personality disorders, those whose symptoms had remitted were significantly more likely to have a good relationship with a spouse/partner and at least one parent, good work/school performance, a sustained work/school history, good global functioning and good psychosocial functioning.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zanarini MC, Frankenburg FR, Hennen J, Reich DB, Silk KR |title=Psychosocial functioning of borderline patients and axis II comparison subjects followed prospectively for six years | trans_title=Psychosocial functioning of borderline patients and axis II comparison subjects followed prospectively for six years |journal=J Personal Disord |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=19–29 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15899718 |doi=10.1521/pedi.19.1.19.62178 |url=}}</ref>
