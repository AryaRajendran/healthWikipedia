'''Facial Electromyography'''  (fEMG) refers to an [[electromyography]] (EMG) technique that measures muscle activity by detecting and amplifying the tiny electrical impulses that are generated by muscle fibers when they contract. 

It primarily focuses on two major muscle groups in the face, the [[corrugator supercilii muscle|corrugator supercilli]] group which is associated with frowning and the [[zygomaticus major muscle]] group which is associated with smiling.<ref name="pmid14696731">{{cite journal |author=Larsen JT, Norris CJ, Cacioppo JT |title=Effects of positive and negative affect on electromyographic activity over zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii |journal=Psychophysiology |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=776–85 |year=2003 |month=September |pmid=14696731 |doi= |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0048-5772&date=2003&volume=40&issue=5&spage=776}}</ref><ref name="pmid18598725">{{cite journal |author=Sato W, Fujimura T, Suzuki N |title=Enhanced facial EMG activity in response to dynamic facial expressions |journal=Int J Psychophysiol |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=70–4 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18598725 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.06.001 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167-8760(08)00698-3}}</ref>

==Uses==
Facial EMG has been studied to assess its utility as a tool for measuring [[emotion]]al reaction.<ref name="pmid2274612">{{cite journal |author=Dimberg U |title=Facial electromyography and emotional reactions |journal=Psychophysiology |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=481–94 |year=1990 |month=September |pmid=2274612 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Studies have found that activity of the corrugator muscle, which lowers the eyebrow and is involved in producing frowns, varies inversely with the emotional valence of presented [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] and reports of [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] state. Activity of the zygomatic muscle, which controls smiling, is said to be positively associated with positive emotional stimuli and positive mood state.

Facial EMG has been used as a technique to distinguish and track positive and negative emotional reactions to a stimulus as they occur.<ref name="pmid16179022">{{cite journal |author=Wolf K, Mass R, Ingenbleek T, Kiefer F, Naber D, Wiedemann K |title=The facial pattern of disgust, appetence, excited joy and relaxed joy: an improved facial EMG study |journal=Scand J Psychol |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=403–9 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16179022 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9450.2005.00471.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0036-5564&date=2005&volume=46&issue=5&spage=403}}</ref> A large number of those experiments have been conducted in controlled laboratory environments using a range of stimuli, e.g., still pictures, movie clips and music pieces.

It has also been used to investigate emotional responses in individuals with [[autism]] spectrum disorders.<ref name="pmid19635079">{{cite journal |author=Oberman LM, Winkielman P, Ramachandran VS |title=Slow echo: facial EMG evidence for the delay of spontaneous, but not voluntary, emotional mimicry in children with autism spectrum disorders |journal=Dev Sci |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=510–20 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19635079 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00796.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1363-755X&date=2009&volume=12&issue=4&spage=510}}</ref>

In 2012 Durso et al. were able to show that facial EMG could be used to detect confusion, both in participants who admitted being confused and in those who did not, suggesting that it could be used as an effective addition to a sensor suite as a monitor of loss of understanding or loss of [[situation awareness]].<ref>Durso, F.T., Geldbach, K.M. and Cotbalis, P., "Detecting Confusion Using Facial Electromyography", ''Human Factors'', Vol. 54, No. 1, February 2012.</ref>

# Advertising Research - Of late, facial EMG has been used to test audience response to commercial advertising. Facial EMG activity measures during a viewing of commercials embedded in TV program clips have been used to describe a commercial's level of emotional activation and engagement. Measurement of the corrugator and zygomatic muscles, yield an overall positive and negative emotional activation score. The moment to moment activation that are recorded are said to measure the dynamic emotional response to a commercial and yield useful insights about the elements of the commercials.

The emotional profiling of games give a useful evaluation of a game's impact on a player, how compelling they find the game, how the game measures up to other games in its genre, and how the different elements of the game enhance or detract from the game's approach to engaging the player.<ref name="loading35">{{cite journal |author=Nacke, L.

== Advantages ==
Proponents of Facial EMG point to the following advantages:
# Facial Electromyography (or fEMG) is a precise and sensitive method to measure emotional expression.
# Unlike self-reports, fEMG does not depend upon language and does not require cognitive effort or memory.
# fEMG is capable of registering the response even when subjects were instructed to inhibit their emotional expression.
# Yields a lot of data and is continuous and scalar (hence more credible.)
# It is able to measure facial muscle activities to even weakly evocative emotional stimuli.
# Less intrusive than other physiological measures like [[fMRI]] and [[EEG]].
# Like other physiological measures, facial EMG measurement technique is often the only useful approach when movement is not visible.

== Criticisms ==
# The technique is intrusive and may alter natural expression.
# Number of muscles it can work with is limited by how many electrodes can be attached to face.
# Certain medicines that act on the nervous system (such as [[muscle relaxants]] and [[anticholinergic]]s) can change electromyography (EMG) results.
# Quantity of validity work with facial EMG is much less.
