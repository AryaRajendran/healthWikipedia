'''Benzene''' is an [[organic compound|organic]] [[chemical compound]] with the molecular formula [[Carbon|C]]<sub>6</sub>[[Hydrogen|H]]<sub>6</sub>. Its molecule is composed of 6 carbon atoms joined in a ring, with 1 hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom. Because its molecules contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms, benzene is classed as a [[hydrocarbon]].

Benzene is a natural constituent of [[petroleum|crude oil]], and is one of the most basic [[petrochemical]]s. Benzene is an [[aromatic hydrocarbon]] and the second [''n'']-[[annulene]] ([6]-annulene), a cyclic hydrocarbon with a continuous [[pi bond]]. It is sometimes abbreviated [[Phenyl|Ph]]–H. Benzene is a [[color]]less and highly [[flammable]] liquid with a sweet smell. It is mainly used as a precursor to heavy chemicals, such as [[ethylbenzene]] and [[cumene]], which are produced on a billion kilogram scale. Because it has a high [[octane number]], it is an important component of [[gasoline]], composing a few percent of its mass. Most non-industrial applications have been limited by benzene's [[carcinogen]]icity.

==History==

===Discovery===
The word "benzene" derives historically from "gum benzoin", sometimes called "benjamin" (i.e., [[benzoin resin]]), an aromatic resin known to European pharmacists and perfumers since the 15th century as a product of southeast Asia.<ref>The word "benzoin" is derived from the Arabic expression "''luban jawi''", or "[[frankincense]] of [[Java]]".{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}</ref> An acidic material was derived from benzoin by sublimation, and named "flowers of benzoin", or benzoic acid. The hydrocarbon derived from benzoic acid thus acquired the name benzin, benzol, or benzene.<ref name=rocke>{{cite journal|author= Rocke, A. J. |title=Hypothesis and Experiment in the Early Development of Kekule's Benzene Theory|journal=[[Annals of Science]]|volume=42|year=1985|pages=355–81|doi =10.1080/00033798500200411|issue= 4}}</ref>

[[Michael Faraday]] first isolated and identified benzene in 1825 from the oily residue derived from the production of illuminating gas, giving it the name ''bicarburet of hydrogen''.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Faraday, M. |title= On new compounds of carbon and hydrogen, and on certain other products obtained during the decomposition of oil by heat|journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]]|volume=115|year=1825|pages=440–466|url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k559209/f473.image|doi=10.1098/rstl.1825.0022|jstor=107752|authorlink= Michael Faraday}}  On pages 443-450, Faraday discusses "bicarburet of hydrogen" (benzene).  On pages 449-450, he shows that benzene's empirical formula is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, although he doesn't realize it because he (like most chemists at that time) used the wrong atomic mass for carbon (6 instead of 12).</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author= R. Kaiser|title=Bicarburet of Hydrogen. Reappraisal of the Discovery of Benzene in 1825 with the Analytical Methods of 1968|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English|volume=7|issue=5|year=1968|pages=345–350|doi=10.1002/anie.196803451}}</ref>

In 1833, [[Eilhard Mitscherlich]] produced it via the [[distillation]] of [[benzoic acid]] (from [[gum benzoin]]) and [[calcium oxide|lime]]. He gave the compound the name ''benzin''.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Mitscherlich, E. |title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=JEs9AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA39#v=onepage&q&f=false Über das Benzol und die Säuren der Oel- und Talgarten] (On benzol and oily and fatty types of acids) |journal=''[[Liebigs Annalen|Annalen der Pharmacie]]''|volume=9|issue=1|year=1834|pages=39–48| doi=10.1002/jlac.18340090103 }}  In a footnote on page 43, Liebig, the journal's editor, suggested changing Mitscherlich's original name for benzene (namely, "benzin") to "benzol", because the suffix "-in" suggested that it was an alkaloid (e.g., Chinin (quinine)), which benzene isn't, whereas the suffix "-ol" suggested that it was oily, which benzene is.  Thus on page 44, Mitscherlich states:  Da diese Flüssigkeit aus der Benzoësäure gewonnen wird, und wahrscheinlich mit den Benzoylverbindungen im Zusammenhang steht, so gibt man ihr am besten den Namen Benzol, da der Name Benzoïn schon für die mit dem Bittermandelöl isomerische Verbindung von Liebig und Wöhler gewählt worden ist.  (Since this liquid [benzene] is obtained from benzoic acid and probably is related to benzoyl compounds, the best name for it is "benzol", since the name "benzoïn" has already been chosen, by Liebig and Wöhler, for the compound that's isomeric with the oil of bitter almonds [benzaldehyde].)</ref>

In 1836, the French chemist [[Auguste Laurent]] named the substance "phène";<ref>Auguste Laurent (1836) "Sur la chlorophénise et les acides chlorophénisique et chlorophénèsique," ''Annales de Chemie et de Physique'', vol. 63, pp. 27–45, see [http://books.google.com/books?id=Lx0AAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA44 p. 44]:  Je donne le nom de phène au radical fondamental des acides précédens (φαινω, j'éclaire), puisque la benzine se trouve dans le gaz de l'éclairage.  (I give the name of "phène" (φαινω, I illuminate) to the fundamental radical of the preceding acid, because benzene is found in illuminating gas.)</ref> this is the root of the word [[phenol]], which is hydroxylated benzene, and [[phenyl]], which is the radical formed by abstraction of a hydrogen atom ([[free radical]] H•) from benzene.

In 1845, Charles Mansfield, working under [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]], isolated benzene from [[coal tar]].<ref>Hofmann, A. W. (1845) [http://books.google.com/books?id=E-1AAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA200 "Ueber eine sichere Reaction auf Benzol"] (On a reliable test for benzene), ''Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', vol. 55, pp. 200–205; on pp. 204–205, Hofmann found benzene in coal tar oil.</ref> Four years later, Mansfield began the first industrial-scale production of benzene, based on the coal-tar method.<ref>Mansfield, Charles Blachford (1849) [http://books.google.com/books?id=kD4aAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA162 "Untersuchung des Steinkohlentheers"] (Investigation of coal tar), ''Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', vol. 69, pp. 162–180.</ref><ref>Charles Mansfield filed for (November 11, 1847) and received (May 1848) a patent (no. 11,960) for the fractional distillation of coal tar.</ref> Gradually the sense developed among chemists that substances related to benzene represent a diverse chemical family. In 1855 [[August Wilhelm Hofmann]] used the word "[[aromatic]]" to designate this family relationship, after a characteristic property of many of its members.<ref>Augustus W. Hoffman (1856) [http://rspl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/8/1.full.pdf+html "On insolinic acid,"] ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London'', vol. 8, pages 1–3.  On page 3, Hoffmann states:  "The existence and mode of formation of insolinic acid prove that to the series of monobasic '''aromatic''' acids, C<sub>n2</sub>H<sub>n2-8</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, the lowest known term of which is benzoic acid, ...."  [Note:  The empirical formulas of organic compounds that appear in Hoffmann's article are wrong because he uses the incorrect atomic masses of carbon (6 instead of 12) and oxygen (8 instead of 16).]</ref>

===Ring formula===
The empirical formula for benzene was long known, but its highly [[Saturation (chemistry)|polyunsaturated]] structure, with just one [[hydrogen]] atom for each [[carbon]] atom, was challenging to determine. [[Archibald Scott Couper]] in 1858 and [[Joseph Loschmidt]] in 1861<ref>J. Loschmidt, ''Chemische Studien'' (Vienna, Austria-Hungary: Carl Gerold's Sohn, 1861), 
[http://books.google.com/books?id=ksw5AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA30 pp. 30, 65].</ref> suggested possible structures that contained multiple double bonds or multiple rings, but too little evidence was then available to help chemists decide on any particular structure.

In 1865, the German chemist [[Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz|Friedrich August Kekulé]] published a paper in French (for he was then teaching in Francophone Belgium) suggesting that the structure contained a six-membered ring of carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds. The next year he published a much longer paper in German on the same subject.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kekulé, F. A. |title= Sur la constitution des substances aromatiques|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bFsSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA98|journal=Bulletin de la Societe Chimique de Paris|volume=3|year=1865|pages= 98–110|authorlink= Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz}}  On p. 100, Kekulé suggests that the carbon atoms of benzene could form a "chaîne fermée" (a closed chain, a loop).</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author= Kekulé, F. A.|title=Untersuchungen über aromatische Verbindungen]  (Investigations of aromatic compounds)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pNryAAAAMAAJ&lpg=PA129|doi = 10.1002/jlac.18661370202|journal=Liebigs Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume=137 |year=1866|pages=129–36|issue=2}}</ref> Kekulé used evidence that had accumulated in the intervening years—namely, that there always appeared to be only one [[isomer]] of any [[Derivative (chemistry)|monoderivative]] of benzene, and that there always appeared to be exactly three isomers of every diderivative—now understood to correspond to the ortho, meta, and para patterns of [[Arene substitution patterns|arene substitution]]—to argue in support of his proposed structure. Kekulé's symmetrical ring could explain these curious facts, as well as benzene's 1:1 carbon-hydrogen ratio.<ref>Critics pointed out a  problem with Kekulé's original (1865/1867) structure for benzene:  Whenever benzene underwent substitution at the ortho position, two distinguishable isomers should have resulted, depending on whether the double bond at the ortho position extended clockwise or counterclockwise; however, no such isomers were observed.  In 1872, Kekulé suggested that benzene had two complementary structures and that these forms rapidly interconverted, so that if there were a double bond between any pair of carbon atoms at one instant, that double bond would become a single bond at the next instant (and vice-versa).  To provide a mechanism for the conversion process, Kekulé proposed that the valency of an atom is determined by the frequency with which it collided with its neighbors in a molecule.  As the carbon atoms in the benzene ring collided with each other, each carbon atom would collide twice with one neighbor during a given interval and then twice with its other neighbor during the next interval.  Thus, a double bond would exist with one neighbor during the first interval and the other neighbor during the next interval.  See [http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Kekule_-_Ueber_einige_Condensationsproducte_des_Aldehyds.pdf&page=10 pages 86–89] of Auguste Kekulé (1872) "Ueber einige Condensationsprodukte des Aldehyds" (On some condensation products of aldehydes), ''Liebig's Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', '''162''': 77–124, 309–320.</ref>

The new understanding of benzene, and hence of all aromatic compounds, proved to be so important for both pure and applied chemistry that in 1890 the German Chemical Society organized an elaborate appreciation in Kekulé's honor, celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of his first benzene paper. Here Kekulé spoke of the creation of the theory. He said that he had discovered the ring shape of the benzene molecule after having a reverie or day-dream of a snake seizing its own tail (this is a common symbol in many ancient cultures known as the [[Ouroboros]] or [[Endless knot]]). This vision, he said, came to him after years of studying the nature of carbon-carbon bonds. This was 7 years after he had solved the problem of how carbon atoms could bond to up to four other atoms at the same time. It is curious that a similar, humorous depiction of benzene had appeared in 1886 in the ''Berichte der Durstigen Chemischen Gesellschaft'' (Journal of the Thirsty Chemical Society), a parody of the ''Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft'', only the parody had monkeys seizing each other in a circle, rather than snakes as in Kekulé's anecdote.<ref>English translation {{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ed042p266|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=42|year=1965|pages=266–67|title=Kekule's benzene ring theory: A subject for lighthearted banter|last1=Wilcox|first1=David H.|last2=Greenbaum|first2=Frederick R.|issue=5|bibcode = 1965JChEd..42..266W }}</ref> Some historians have suggested that the parody was a lampoon of the snake anecdote, possibly already well known through oral transmission even if it had not yet appeared in print.<ref name=rocke/> (Some others have speculated that Kekulé's story in 1890 was a re-parody of the monkey spoof, and was a mere invention rather than a recollection of an event in his life.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}) Kekulé's 1890 speech<ref>{{cite journal| author=Kekulé, F.

===Early applications===
In the 19th and early-20th centuries, benzene was used as an after-shave lotion because of its pleasant smell. Prior to the 1920s, benzene was frequently used as an industrial solvent, especially for degreasing metal. As its toxicity became obvious, benzene was supplanted by other solvents, especially [[toluene]] (methyl benzene), which has similar physical properties but is not as carcinogenic.
[[File:Solid benzene.png|thumb|Frozen benzene]]
In 1903, [[Ludwig Roselius]] popularized the use of benzene to [[decaffeination|decaffeinate]] [[coffee]]. This discovery led to the production of [[Sanka]] (Sanka = ''sans caféine'' = without caffeine). This process was later discontinued. Benzene was historically used as a significant component in many consumer products such as Liquid Wrench, several paint strippers, rubber cements, spot removers and other hydrocarbon-containing products. Some ceased manufacture of their benzene-containing formulations in about 1950, while others continued to use benzene as a component or significant contaminant until the late 1970s when leukemia deaths were found associated with Goodyear's Pliofilm production operations in Ohio. Until the late 1970s, many hardware stores, paint stores, and other retail outlets sold benzene in small cans, such as quart size, for general-purpose use. Many students were exposed to benzene in school and university courses while performing laboratory experiments with little or no ventilation in many cases. This very dangerous practice has been almost totally eliminated.

==Structure==
{{Main|Aromaticity}}
Benzene represents a special problem in that, to account for the bond lengths quantitatively, there must either be electron delocalization (MO theory) or a spin coupling of the p-orbitals (VB theory):<ref>{{cite book |author=David Cooper |title=Valence Bond Theory |location= |publisher=Elsevier |year=2002 |pages=125–131 |isbn=0-080-54349-9}}</ref>

[[File:Benzene Representations.svg|thumb|left|The various representations of benzene|left]]

[[X-ray diffraction]] shows that all of six carbon-carbon bonds in benzene are of the same length of 140 [[picometre]]s (pm). The C–C [[bond length]]s are greater than a double bond (135 pm) but shorter than a single bond (147 pm).<!--147pm is the sp2–sp2 single bond length without conjugation --> This intermediate distance is consistent with electron [[Delocalized electron|delocalization]]: the electrons for C–C bonding are distributed equally between each of the six carbon atoms. Benzene has 8 hydrogen atoms fewer than the corresponding parent alkane, hexane. The molecule is planar<!-- (ignoring quantum/thermal vibrations), although many calculations predict otherwise-->.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1021/ja0630285|title = Popular Theoretical Methods Predict Benzene and Arenes To Be Nonplanar|pmid = 16848464|year = 2006|last1 = Moran|first1 = Damian|last2 = Simmonett|first2 = Andrew C.|last3 = Leach|first3 = Franklin E.|last4 = Allen|first4 = Wesley D.|last5 = Schleyer|first5 = Paul v.

To indicate the delocalized nature of the bonding, benzene is often depicted with a circle inside a hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms.

As is common in organic chemistry, the carbon atoms in the diagram above have been left unlabeled. Realizing each carbon has 2p electrons, each carbon donates an electron into the delocalized ring above and below the benzene ring. It is the side-on overlap of p-orbitals that produces the pi clouds.

Derivatives of benzene occur sufficiently often as a component of organic molecules that there is a [[Unicode]] symbol in the [[Miscellaneous Technical (Unicode)|Miscellaneous Technical]] block with the code U+232C (⌬) to represent it with three double bonds,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/232c/index.htm |title=Unicode Character 'BENZENE RING' (U+232C) |accessdate=2009-01-16}}</ref> and U+23E3 (⏣) for a delocalized version.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/23e3/index.htm |title=Unicode Character 'BENZENE RING WITH CIRCLE' (U+23E3) |accessdate=2009-01-16}}</ref>

==Benzene derivatives==
{{Main|Aromatic hydrocarbons|Alkylbenzenes}}
Many important chemical compounds are derived from benzene by replacing one or more of its hydrogen atoms with another [[functional group]]. Examples of simple benzene derivatives are [[phenol]], [[toluene]], and [[aniline]], abbreviated PhOH, PhMe, and PhNH<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Linking benzene rings gives [[biphenyl]], C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>–C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>. Further loss of hydrogen gives "fused" aromatic hydrocarbons, such as [[naphthalene]] and [[anthracene]]. The limit of the fusion process is the hydrogen-free allotrope of carbon, [[graphite]].

In [[heterocyclic chemistry|heterocycles]], carbon atoms in the benzene ring are replaced with other elements. The most important derivatives are the rings containing [[nitrogen]]. Replacing one CH with N gives the compound [[pyridine]], C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N. Although benzene and pyridine are ''structurally'' related, benzene cannot be converted into pyridine. Replacement of a second CH bond with N gives, depending on the location of the second N, [[pyridazine]], [[pyrimidine]], and [[pyrazine]].

==Production==
Four chemical processes contribute to industrial benzene production: [[catalytic reforming]], [[toluene]] hydrodealkylation, toluene disproportionation, and [[steam cracking]]. According to the [[ATSDR]] Toxicological Profile for benzene, between 1978 and 1981, catalytic reformats accounted for approximately 44–50% of the total U.S benzene production.

Until [[World War II]], most benzene was produced as a by-product of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] production (or "coke-oven light oil") in the [[steel]] industry. However, in the 1950s, increased demand for benzene, especially from the growing [[polymer]]s industry, necessitated the production of benzene from petroleum. Today, most benzene comes from the [[petrochemical]] industry, with only a small fraction being produced from coal.

===Catalytic reforming===
In catalytic reforming, a mixture of [[hydrocarbon]]s with boiling points between 60–200 °C is blended with [[hydrogen]] gas and then exposed to a [[bifunctional]] [[platinum]] chloride or [[rhenium]] chloride [[catalyst]] at 500–525 °C and pressures ranging from 8–50 atm. Under these conditions, [[aliphatic]] hydrocarbons form rings and lose hydrogen to become aromatic hydrocarbons. The aromatic products of the reaction are then separated from the reaction mixture (or reformate) by [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extraction]] with any one of a number of [[solvent]]s, including [[diethylene glycol]] or [[sulfolane]], and benzene is then separated from the other aromatics by distillation. The extraction step of aromatics from the reformate is designed to produce aromatics with lowest non-aromatic components. Recovery of the aromatics, commonly referred to as [[BTX (chemistry)|BTX]] (benzene, toluene and xylene isomers), involves such extraction and distillation steps. There are a good many licensed processes available for extraction of the aromatics.

In similar fashion to this catalytic reforming, [[UOP LLC|UOP]] and [[BP]] commercialized a method from LPG (mainly propane and butane) to aromatics.

===Toluene hydrodealkylation===
Toluene [[hydrodealkylation]] converts [[toluene]] to benzene. In this hydrogen-intensive process, toluene is mixed with hydrogen, then passed over a [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], or [[platinum]] [[oxide]] catalyst at 500–600 °C and 40–60 atm pressure. Sometimes, higher temperatures are used instead of a catalyst (at the similar reaction condition). Under these conditions, toluene undergoes dealkylation to benzene and [[methane]]:

:C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> → C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> + CH<sub>4</sub>

This irreversible reaction is accompanied by an equilibrium side reaction that produces
[[biphenyl]] (aka diphenyl) at higher temperature:

:2 {{chem|C|6|H|6}} {{eqm}} {{chem|H|2}} + {{chem|C|6|H|5|–C|6|H|5}}

If the raw material stream contains much non-aromatic components (paraffins or naphthenes), those are likely decomposed to lower hydrocarbons such as methane, which increases the consumption of hydrogen.

A typical reaction yield exceeds 95%. Sometimes, [[xylene]]s and heavier aromatics are used in place of toluene, with similar efficiency.

This is often called "on-purpose" methodology to produce benzene, compared to conventional BTX (benzene-toluene-xylene) extraction processes.

===Toluene disproportionation===
Where a chemical complex has similar demands for both benzene and [[xylene]], then toluene [[disproportionation]] ('''TDP''') may be an attractive alternative to the toluene hydrodealkylation. In the broad sense, 2 toluene molecules are reacted and the methyl groups rearranged from one toluene molecule to the other, yielding one benzene molecule and one xylene molecule.

Given that demand for ''para''-xylene ([[P-Xylene|''p''-xylene]]) substantially exceeds demand for other xylene isomers, a refinement of the TDP process called '''Selective TDP''' (STDP) may be used. In this process, the xylene stream exiting the TDP unit is approximately 90% paraxylene. In some current catalytic systems, even the benzene-to-xylenes ratio is decreased (more xylenes) when the demand of xylenes is higher.

===Steam cracking===
[[Steam cracking]] is the process for producing [[ethylene]] and other [[alkene]]s from [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic hydrocarbons]]. Depending on the feedstock used to produce the olefins, steam cracking can produce a benzene-rich liquid by-product called ''[[pyrolysis gasoline]]''. Pyrolysis gasoline can be blended with other hydrocarbons as a gasoline additive, or routed through an extraction process to recover [[BTX (chemistry)|BTX]] aromatics (benzene, toluene and xylenes).

===Other sources===
Trace amounts of benzene may result whenever [[carbon]]-rich materials undergo incomplete [[combustion]]. It is produced in [[volcano]]es and [[forest fire]]s, and is also a component of [[cigarette]] smoke. Benzene is a principal product from the combustion of PVC (polyvinyl chloride).

==Uses==
Benzene is used mainly as an intermediate to make other chemicals.  About 80% of benzene is consumed in the production of three chemicals, [[ethylbenzene]], [[cumene]], and [[cyclohexane]].  Its most widely produced derivative is ethylbenzene, precursor to [[styrene]], which is used to make polymers and plastics.  Cumene is converted [[phenol]] for resins and adhesives.  [[Cyclohexane]] is used in the manufacture of Nylon. Smaller amounts of benzene are used to make some types of [[rubber]]s, [[lubricant]]s, [[dye]]s, [[detergent]]s, [[drug]]s, [[explosive]]s, and [[pesticide]]s.

In both the US and Europe, 50% of benzene is used in the production of [[ethylbenzene]]/styrene, 20% is used in the production of [[cumene]], and about 15% of benzene is used in the production of [[cyclohexane]] (eventually to [[nylon]]).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Currently, the production of and demand for benzene in the Middle East register the greatest increases worldwide. It will probably see its share of the global supply and demand expand by 3.7 and 3.3 percentage points, respectively, until 2018. However, the Asia-Pacific region will continue to dominate the market and account for almost half of the global demand.<ref>[http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/chemicals/benzene Market Study on Benzene by Ceresana Research].</ref>

In laboratory research, [[toluene]] is now often used as a substitute for benzene. The solvent-properties of the two are similar, but toluene is less toxic and has a wider liquid range.

===Component of gasoline===
As a [[gasoline]] (petrol) additive, benzene increases the [[octane rating]] and reduces [[Engine knocking|knocking]]. As a consequence, gasoline often contained several percent benzene before the 1950s, when [[tetraethyl lead]] replaced it as the most widely used antiknock additive. With the global phaseout of leaded gasoline, benzene has made a comeback as a gasoline additive in some nations. In the [[United States]], concern over its negative health effects and the possibility of benzene's entering the [[groundwater]] have led to stringent regulation of gasoline's benzene content, with limits typically around 1%.<ref>Kolmetz, Gentry, Guidelines for BTX Revamps, AIChE 2007 Spring Conference</ref> European petrol specifications now contain the same 1% limit on benzene content. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] introduced new regulations in 2011 that lowered the benzene content in gasoline to 0.62%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/EPA-AIR/2006/March/Day-29/a2315b.htm |title=Control of Hazardous Air Pollutants From Mobile Sources |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |page=15853 |accessdate=2008-06-27 |date=2006-03-29}}</ref>

:[[File:OChem-Mech-ElectrophilicAromaticSubstitution-General.png|thumb|center|450px|Electrophilic aromatic substitution of benzene]]

The most widely practiced example of this reaction is the [[ethylation]] of benzene.
::[[File:EtC6H5route.png|320 px]]
Approximately 24,700,000 tons were produced in 1999.<ref>Vincent A.Welch, Kevin J. Fallon, Heinz-Peter Gelbke “Ethylbenzene”  ''Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a10_035.pub2}}</ref>
Highly instructive but of far less industrial significance is the [[Friedel-Crafts alkylation]] of benzene (and many other aromatic rings) using an [[alkyl halide]] in the presence of a strong Lewis acid catalyst. Similarly, the [[Friedel-Crafts acylation]] is a related example of [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]]. The reaction involves the [[acylation]] of benzene (or many other aromatic rings) with an [[acyl chloride]] using a strong [[Lewis acid]] [[catalyst]] such as [[aluminium chloride]] or [[Iron(III) chloride]].

[[File:Benzen acylowany.svg|thumb|center|300px|Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene by acetyl chloride]]

===Sulfonation, chlorination, nitration===
Using electrophilic aromatic substitution, many functional groups are introduced onto the benzene framework.  [[Aromatic sulfonation|Sulfonation]] of benzene involves the use of [[oleum]], a mixture of sulfuric acid with [[sulfur trioxide]]. Sulfonated benzene derivatives are useful [[detergent]]s.  In [[nitration]], benzene reacts with nitronium ions (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>), which is a strong electrophile produced by combining sulfuric and nitric acids.  [[Nitrobenzene]] is the precursor to [[aniline]].  Chlorination in achieved with chlorine to give [[chlorobenzene]] in the presence of a catalyst such as aluminium trichloride.

===Hydrogenation===
Via [[hydrogenation]], benzene and its derivatives convert to cyclohexane and derivatives.  This reaction is achieved by the use of high pressures of [[hydrogen]] at high temperatures in the presence of a finely divided [[nickel]], which serves as a [[catalyst]].  In the absence of the catalyst, benzene is impervious to hydrogen. This reaction is practiced on a very large scale industrially.

===Metal complexes===
Benzene is an excellent [[ligand]] in the [[complex (chemistry)|organometallic]] chemistry of low-valent metals. Important examples include the sandwich and half-sandwich complexes, respectively, [[Bis(benzene)chromium|Cr(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]] and [RuCl<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>)]<sub>2</sub>.

==Health effects==
[[File:Benzol.JPG|A bottle of benzene. The warnings show benzene is a toxic and flammable liquid.|thumb]]
Benzene increases the risk of cancer and other illnesses. Benzene is a notorious cause of bone marrow failure. Substantial quantities of epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data link benzene to aplastic anemia, acute leukemia, and bone marrow abnormalities.<ref>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th ed., p. 618.</ref><ref>[http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/print/sec13/ch159/ch159a.html Merck Manual, Home Edition,] "Overview of Leukemia".</ref>  The specific hematologic malignancies that benzene is associated with include: acute myeloid leukemia (AML), aplastic anemia, myleodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).<ref name="Smith 2010 133–48">{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Martyn T.|title=Advances in understanding benzene health effects and susceptibility|journal=Ann Rev Pub Health|year=2010|volume=31|pages=133–48|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103646}}</ref>

The [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API) stated in 1948 that "it is generally considered that the only absolutely safe concentration for benzene is zero."<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20030310145140/http://hobsonlaw.com/benzene_pages/pdffile.pdf American Petroleum Institute, API Toxicological Review, Benzene, September 1948], Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Department of Health and Human Services</ref> The [[US Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS) classifies benzene as a human [[carcinogen]].

==Exposure to benzene==
[[File:Lichtbrechung von Benzol.jpg|thumb|Light refraction of benzene (above) and water (below)]]
:''See also : [[Benzene in soft drinks#Environmental exposure to benzene]]''
Vapors from products that contain benzene, such as glues, paints, furniture wax, and detergents, can also be a source of exposure, although many of these have been modified or reformulated since the late 1970s to eliminate or reduce the benzene content. Air around hazardous waste sites or gas stations may contain higher levels of benzene. Because petroleum hydrocarbon products are complex mixtures of chemicals, risk assessments for these products, in general, focus on specific toxic constituents. The petroleum constituents of primary interest to human health have been the aromatic hydrocarbons (i.e., benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, and xylenes). In the U.S., OSHA requires that a mixture "shall be assumed to present a carcinogenic hazard if it contains a component in concentrations of 0.1% or greater, which is considered to be a carcinogen.<ref>[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10099 OSHA Hazard Communication Standard 1910.1200(d)(5)(ii), carcinogens under (d)(4) of this section].

In 1987, the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] estimated that about 237,000 workers in the United States were potentially exposed to benzene.-->

Outdoor air may contain low levels of benzene from automobile service stations, wood smoke, tobacco smoke, the transfer of gasoline, exhaust from motor vehicles, and industrial emissions.<ref>[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts3.html#bookmark04 ToxFAQs for Benzene], Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Department of Health and Human Services</ref> About 50% of the entire nationwide (United States) exposure to benzene results from smoking tobacco or from exposure to tobacco smoke.<ref>[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxguides/toxguide-3.pdf?id=39&tid=14 ToxGuide for Benzene], Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Department of Health and Human Services</ref>

===Inhalation===
Inhaled benzene is primarily expelled unchanged through exhalation. In a human study 16.4 to 41.6% of retained benzene was eliminated through the lungs within five to seven hours after a two- to three-hour exposure to 47 to 110 ppm and only 0.07 to 0.2% of the remaining benzene was excreted unchanged in the urine. After exposure to 63 to 405&nbsp;mg/m3 of benzene for 1 to 5 hours, 51 to 87% was excreted in the urine as phenol over a period of 23 to 50 hours. In another human study, 30% of absorbed dermally applied benzene, which is primarily metabolized in the liver, was excreted as phenol in the urine.<ref>[http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@rn+71-43-2 Benzene, CASRN: 71-43-2]. Hazardous Substances Data Bank, U.S. National Library of Medicine. National Institutes of Health.</ref>

===Exposure through smoking===
Exposure of the general population to benzene occurs mainly through breathing, the major sources of benzene being tobacco smoke (about 50%) as well as automobile service stations, exhaust from motor vehicles and industrial emissions (about 20% altogether). According to the CDC, "The mean number of cigarettes per day (cpd) among daily smokers in 1993 was 19.6 (21.3 cpd for men and 17.8 cpd for women) and in 2004 was 16.8 (18.1 cpd for men and 15.3 cpd for women)." http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5444a2.htm
According to the August 2007 Public Health Statement, the average smoker smokes 32 cpd, which in turn the average smoker would take in about 1.8 milligrams (mg) of benzene per day. This amount is about 10 times the average daily intake of benzene by nonsmokers.<ref>[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ToxProfiles/tp3-c1-b.pdf Public Health Statement.

===Exposure from soft drinks===
{{Expand section|date=April 2013}}

In March 2006, the official [[Food Standards Agency]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] conducted a survey of 150 brands of soft drinks. It found that four contained benzene levels above [[World Health Organization]] limits. The affected batches were removed from sale.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/19/health/main1638170.shtml "FDA: Too Much Benzene In Some Drinks"], ''CBS News'', May 19, 2006. Retrieved July 11, 2006.</ref> (See also [[benzene in soft drinks]]).

===Case examples===
Water and [[soil contamination]] are important pathways of concern for transmission of benzene. In the US alone, approximately 100,000 sites have soil or groundwater contaminated with benzene.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} 

In 2005, the water supply to the city of [[Harbin]] in China with a population of almost nine million people, was cut off because of a [[Jilin chemical plant explosions 2005|major benzene exposure]]. Benzene leaked into the [[Songhua River]], which supplies drinking water to the city, after an explosion at a China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) factory in the city of Jilin on 13 November.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Benzene exposure limits===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has set a [[maximum contaminant level]] (MCL) for benzene in drinking water at 0.005&nbsp;mg/L (5 ppb), as promulgated via the U.S. National Primary Drinking Water Regulations.<ref>[http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/index.cfm#Organic Drinking Water Contaminants|Drinking Water Contaminants|US EPA]. Water.epa.gov. Retrieved on 2010-10-09.</ref> This regulation is based on preventing benzene leukemogenesis. The maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG), a nonenforceable health goal that would allow an adequate margin of safety for the prevention of adverse effects, is zero benzene concentration in drinking water. The EPA requires that spills or accidental releases into the environment of 10 pounds (4.5&nbsp;kg) or more of benzene be reported.

The U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set a permissible exposure limit of 1 part of benzene per million parts of air (1 ppm) in the workplace during an 8-hour workday, 40-hour workweek. The short term exposure limit for airborne benzene is 5 ppm for 15 minutes.<ref>[http://www.osha.gov/dts/chemicalsampling/data/CH_220100.html Chemical Sampling Information Benzene]. Osha.gov. Retrieved on 2011-11-23.</ref> These legal limits were based on studies demonstrating compelling evidence of health risk to workers exposed to benzene. The risk from exposure to 1 ppm for a working lifetime has been estimated as 5 excess leukemia deaths per 1,000 employees exposed. (This estimate assumes no threshold for benzene's carcinogenic effects.) OSHA has also established an action level of 0.5 ppm to encourage even lower exposures in the workplace.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20100610004540/http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/benzene/standards_regulations.html Benzene Toxicity: Standards and Regulations|ATSDR – Environmental Medicine & Environmental Health Education – CSEM].

The U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) revised the [[Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health]] (IDLH) concentration for benzene to 500 ppm. The current NIOSH definition for an IDLH condition, as given in the NIOSH Respirator Selection Logic, is one that poses a threat of exposure to airborne contaminants when that exposure is likely to cause death or immediate or delayed permanent adverse health effects or prevent escape from such an environment [NIOSH 2004]. The purpose of establishing an IDLH value is (1) to ensure that the worker can escape from a given contaminated environment in the event of failure of the respiratory protection equipment and (2) is considered a maximum level above which only a highly reliable breathing apparatus providing maximum worker protection is permitted [NIOSH 2004<ref>NIOSH respirator selection logic.

In providing consultation on work safety during oil clean-up operations following the Deepwater Horizon accident, OSHA has worked with a number of other government agencies to protect Gulf cleanup workers. OSHA partnered with the NIOSH to issue "Interim Guidance for Protecting Deepwater Horizon Response Workers and Volunteers" and recommend measures that should be taken to protect workers from a variety of different health hazards that these workers face.<ref>[http://www.osha.gov/oilspills/interimguidance.html NIOSH/OSHA Interim Guidance for Protecting Deepwater Horizon Response Workers and Volunteers], Osha.gov (2010-07-26)</ref> OSHA conceded that it recognizes that most of its PELs are outdated and inadequate measures of worker safety. In characterizing worker exposure, OSHA instead relies on more up-to-date recommended protective limits set by organizations such as NIOSH, the ACGIH, and the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), and not on the older, less protective PELS. Results of air monitoring are compared to the lowest known Occupational Exposure Limit for the listed contaminant for purposes of risk assessment and protective equipment recommendations.<ref>[http://www.osha.gov/oilspills/interim-guidance-qa.html Hazards Associated with Oil Cleanup Operations].

===Biomarkers of exposure===
Several tests can determine exposure to benzene. Benzene itself can be measured in breath, blood or urine, but such testing is usually limited to the first 24 hours post-exposure due to the relatively rapid removal of the chemical by exhalation or biotransformation. Most persons in developed countries have measureable baseline levels of benzene and other aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons in their blood. In the body, benzene is enzymatically converted to a series of oxidation products including [[muconic acid]], [[phenylmercapturic acid]], [[phenol]], [[catechol]], [[hydroquinone]] and [[Hydroxyquinol|1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene]]. Most of these metabolites have some value as biomarkers of human exposure, since they accumulate in the urine in proportion to the extent and duration of exposure, and they may still be present for some days after exposure has ceased. The current ACGIH biological exposure limits for occupational exposure are 500 μg/g creatinine for muconic acid and 25 μg/g creatinine for phenylmercapturic acid in an end-of-shift urine specimen.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ashley|pmid=8013127|first1=DL|year=1994|pages=1401–4|issue=7 Pt 2|last2=Bonin|volume=40|journal=Clinical chemistry|first2=MA|last3=Cardinali|first3=FL|last4=McCraw|first4=JM|last5=Wooten|first5=JV|title=Blood concentrations of volatile organic compounds in a nonoccupationally exposed US population and in groups with suspected exposure|url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/reprint/40/7/1401.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fustinoni|first1=S|last2=Buratti|first2=M|last3=Campo|first3=L|last4=Colombi|first4=A|last5=Consonni|first5=D|last6=Pesatori|first6=AC|last7=Bonzini|first7=M|last8=Farmer|first8=P|last9=Garte|first9=S|title=Urinary t,t-muconic acid, S-phenylmercapturic acid and benzene as biomarkers of low benzene exposure|journal=Chemico-biological interactions|volume=153–154|pages=253–6|year=2005|pmid=15935823|doi=10.1016/j.cbi.2005.03.031}}</ref><ref>ACGIH.

===Biotransformations===
Even if it is not a common substrate for the metabolism of organisms, benzene can be oxidized by both [[bacteria]] and [[eukaryote]]s. In bacteria, [[dioxygenase]] enzyme can add an [[oxygen]] molecule to the ring, and the unstable product is immediately reduced (by [[NADH]]) to a cyclic [[diol]] with two double bonds, breaking the aromaticity. Next, the diol is newly reduced by NADH to [[catechol]]. The catechol is then metabolized to [[acetyl CoA]] and [[succinyl CoA]], used by organisms mainly in the [[Krebs Cycle]] for energy production.

The pathway for the metabolism of benzene is complex and begins in the liver.  Several key enzymes are involved.  These include [[cytochrome P450]] 2E1 (CYP2E1), quinine oxidoreductase (NQ01), GSH, and myeloperoxidase (MPO).  CYP2E1 is involved at multiple steps: converting benzene to [[oxepin]] (benzene oxide), [[phenol]] to [[hydroquinone]], and hydroquinone to both benzenetriol and [[catechol]].  Hydroquinone, benzenetriol and catechol are converted to polyphenols.  In the bone marrow, MPO converts these polyphenols to benzoquinones.  These intermediates and metabolites induce genotoxicity by multiple mechanisms including inhibition of topoisomerase II (which maintains chromosome structure), disruption of microtubules (which maintains cellular structure and organization), generation of oxygen free radicals (unstable species) that may lead to point mutations, increasing oxidative stress, inducing DNA strand breaks, and altering DNA methylation (which can affect gene expression).  NQ01 and GSH shift metabolism away from toxicity.  NQ01 metabolizes benzoquinone toward polyphenols (counteracting the effect of MPO).  GSH is involved with the formation of phenylmercapturic acid.<ref name="Smith 2010 133–48"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Snyder|first=R|coauthors=Hedli, C.C.|title=An overview of benzene metabolism|journal=Environ Health Perspect|year=1996|volume=104|pages=1165–1171|pmid=9118888|pmc=1469747|issue=Suppl 6}}</ref>

Genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes may induce loss of function or gain of function.  For example, mutations in CYP2E1 increase activity and result in increased generation of toxic metabolites.  NQ01 mutations result in loss of function and may result in decreased detoxification.  Myeloperoxidase mutations result in loss of function and may result in decreased generation of toxic metabolites.  GSH mutations or deletions result in loss of function and result in decreased detoxification.  These genes may be targets for genetic screening for susceptibility to benzene toxicity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dougherty|first=D|coauthors=Garte, S; Barchowsky, A; Zmuda, J; Taioli, E|title=NQO1, MPO, CYP2E1, GSTT1 and STM1 polymorphisms and biological effects of benzene exposure—a literature review|journal=Toxicology Letters|year=2008|volume=182|pages=7–17|doi=10.1016/j.toxlet.2008.09.008|pmid=18848868|issue=1–3}}</ref>

===Molecular toxicology===
The paradigm of toxicological assessment of benzene is shifting towards the domain of molecular toxicology as it allows understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms in a better way. [[Glutathione]] seems to play an important role by protecting against benzene-induced DNA breaks and it is being identified as a new biomarker for exposure and effect.<ref name=r3>{{Cite journal|last=Fracasso|first=M.E.|last2=Doria|year=2009|pages=22–8|first2=D|issue=1|last3=Bartolucci|first3=GB|last4=Carrieri|first4=M|last5=Lovreglio|first5=P|last6=Ballini|first6=A|last7=Soleo|first7=L|last8=Tranfo|first8=G|last9=Manno|first9=M|volume=192|title=Low air levels of benzene: Correlation between biomarkers of exposure and genotoxic effects|journal=[[Toxicol Lett]]|pmid=19427373|doi=10.1016/j.toxlet.2009.04.028}}</ref> Benzene causes chromosomal aberrations in the peripheral blood leukocytes and bone marrow explaining the higher incidence of leukemia and multiple myeloma caused by chronic exposure.

===Biological oxidation and carcinogenic activity===
One way of understanding the carcinogenic effects of benzene is by examining the products of biological oxidation. Pure benzene, for example, oxidizes in the body to produce an epoxide, [[benzene oxide]], which is not excreted readily and can interact with DNA to produce harmful mutations.

===Summary===
According to the [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] (ATSDR) (2007), benzene is both an anthropogenically produced and naturally occurring chemical from processes that include: volcanic eruptions, wild fires, synthesis of chemicals such as phenol, production of synthetic fibers, and fabrication of rubbers, lubricants, pesticides, medications, and dyes. The major sources of benzene exposure are tobacco smoke, automobile service stations, exhaust from motor vehicles, and industrial emissions; however, ingestion and dermal absorption of benzene can also occur through contact with contaminated water. Benzene is hepatically metabolized and excreted in the urine. Measurement of air and water levels of benzene is accomplished through collection via activated charcoal tubes, which are then analyzed with a gas chromatograph. The measurement of benzene in humans can be accomplished via urine, blood, and breath tests; however, all of these have their limitations because benzene is rapidly metabolized in the human body into by-products called metabolites.<ref>[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mhmi/mmg3handout.pdf Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.
