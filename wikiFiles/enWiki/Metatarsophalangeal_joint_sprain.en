A '''metatarsophalangeal joint sprain''' is an injury to the [[connective tissue]] between the [[foot]] and one of the toes. When the [[hallux|big toe]] is involved, it is known as "'''turf toe'''".<ref name="pmid15605946">{{cite journal |author=Allen LR, Flemming D, Sanders TG |title=Turf toe: ligamentous injury of the first metatarsophalangeal joint |journal=[[Mil Med]] |volume=169 |issue=11 |pages=xix–xxiv |year=2004 |pmid=15605946 |doi=}}</ref><ref name="pmid12869604">{{cite journal |author=Kubitz ER |title=Athletic injuries of the first metatarsophalangeal joint |journal=[[J Am Podiatr Med Assoc]] |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=325–32 |year=2003 |pmid=12869604 |doi= |url=http://www.japmaonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12869604}}</ref>

==Causes==

Turf toe is named from the injury being associated with playing sports on rigid surfaces such as [[artificial turf]]<ref name="pmid16900075">{{cite journal |author=Childs SG |title=The pathogenesis and biomechanics of turf toe |journal=[[Orthop Nurs]] |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=276–80; quiz 281–2 |year=2006 |pmid=16900075 |doi= 10.1097/00006416-200607000-00012|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/meadia/landingpage.htm?an=00006416-200607000-00012}}</ref> and is a fairly common injury among professional [[American football]] players.  Often, the injury occurs when someone or something falls on the back of the calf while that leg's knee and tips of the toes are touching the ground.  The toe is hyperextended and thus the joint is injured.  Additionally, athletic shoes with very flexible soles combined with cleats that "grab" the turf will cause overextension of the big toe. This can occur on the lesser toes as well.

This is a primary reason why many athletes prefer natural [[grass]] to turf, because it is softer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Turf Toe – Every Athlete’s Nightmare|url=http://jointachesandpains.org/turf-toe-every-athletes-nightmare-2/|publisher=Joint, Aches, and Pain Org|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref> 

A variation of "turf" toe can also happen when the nail bed is forced into the [[cuticle]] and swelling with isolated pain may occur.

It can also be caused by not cutting one's toenails properly. If toenails are sufficiently long enough that they rub on one's shoes, the metatarsal can become hyper-extended, especially when engaged in running or other physical activity.

==Treatment and prognosis==
The injury can be debilitating for athletes of many sports who need to accelerate, quickly change direction, or jump. Use of the toes is not possible during the healing process.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}  Since the toes are necessary for proper push-off when accelerating, those sorts of athletic activities can be almost completely curtailed. A healing period of one or more months is often required.

Because of the anatomy of the distal foot and the unique use of the foot, it is often impossible to properly tape or brace the joint. Although difficult, it is not impossible to tape the toe to limit dorsiflexion (upward bend of toe). Additionally, wearing a shoe with a rigid sole (often a metal plate) and cushioned innersole will help minimize extension of the joint. Anti-inflammatory medication as well as physical therapy is recommended.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Turf toe can often progress into a chronic problem, in which the joint(s) never really heals or heals too slowly to return to usual physical activities.

Turf toe can become more serious if left untreated, and may cause serious problems for the athlete.

Treating the injury includes icing of the area, elevating the foot, and using anti-inflammatory medication.
