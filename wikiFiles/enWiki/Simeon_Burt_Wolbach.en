'''Simeon Burt Wolbach''' (3 July 1880 - 19 March 1954) was an American pathologist, researcher, teacher, and journal editor who elucidated the infection vectors for [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]] and [[epidemic typhus]].<ref name=ANB>{{cite journal|author=Wolbach SB|title=The Glorious Past, the Doleful Present, and the Uncertain Future of Pathology |journal=Harvard Medical School Alumni Bulletin |volume=28 |year=1954 |pages=45–48 }}</ref> He was president of the [[American Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists]] and of the [[American Society for Experimental Pathology]].<ref name=Warren />

Born the son of banker Samuel N. Wolbach and Rosa Stein, he was raised in rural Nebraska in the [[wild west]] era. He went east to study in Boston and remained there most of his life. He married Anna F. Wellington in 1914 and had three children.

==Education==
Harvard [[Lawrence Scientific School]], then [[Harvard Medical School]] M.D. 1903
[[Boston City Hospital]] postgraduate studies in pathology with [[Frank Burr Mallory]] and [[William T. Councilman]] 1903-05

==Career==
In 1905, he returned to Harvard Medical School to work in pathology as an assistant under Councilman, while he was also the pathologist to the [[Boston Lying-In Hospital]] and the [[Long Island (Massachusetts)|Long Island]] chronic care hospital. Three years later he became the director of Bender Hygienic Laboratory (today part of St. Peter's Healthcare) in [[Albany, New York]], while an adjunct professor and department head of pathology and [[bacteriology]] at [[Albany Medical College]].  He spent 1909 at [[Montreal General Hospital]] and [[McGill University]], then in 1910 returned to Harvard's Department of Bacteriology under [[Harold Clarence Ernst|Harold C. Ernst]]. In 1914 he became an associate professor of pathology and bacteriology there, then in 1922 was made the head of pathology, occupying the chair as Shattuck Professor of Pathological Anatomy. From 1922 to 47 he was at [[Peter Bent Brigham Hospital]] and [[Children's Hospital of Boston]] as chief of pathology.<ref name=ANB/>
In 1938 he was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=Wright>{{cite journal |title=The Annual Meeting of the National Academy of Sciences |author=Wright FE |journal=The Scientific Monthly  |volume=46 |issue=6 |date=June 1938 |pages=582–587 |jstor=16565  }}</ref>

==Research==
Wolbach's early research was into the effects of radiation on skin with Porter. Later field work in Africa got him interested in tropical parasitology.<ref name=Warren>{{cite journal |author=Warren S |journal=Journal of Pathology and Bacteriology |volume=68 |title=Simeon Burt Wolbach 3rd July 1880-15th March 1954 |pages=656–7 }}</ref>

Working with McGill parasitologist [[John L. Todd]], they carried uninfected lice (feeding them on their persons) to Poland in 1920 in order to demonstrate that lice transmit [[Rickettsia prowazekii]], the organism which is the cause of [[epidemic typhus]]. For this work he received the rank of Commander in the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]].  
Wolbach turned his attention to childhood development and vitamin deficiencies. Working with [[J.M. Coppoletta]] at Brigham and Children's, he developed tables of the weights of vital organs for different ages and body lengths which became a definitive reference for pediatric pathology.
