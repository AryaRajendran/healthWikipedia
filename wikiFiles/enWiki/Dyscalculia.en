'''Dyscalculia''' (also called '''math disability''' or '''numlexia''') is a [[specific learning disability]] involving [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|innate]] difficulty in learning or comprehending [[arithmetic]]. It is akin to [[dyslexia]] and includes difficulty in understanding numbers, learning how to manipulate numbers, learning maths facts, and a number of other related symptoms.  Math disabilities can also occur as the result of some types of brain injury, in which case the proper term is [[acalculia]], to distinguish it from dyscalculia which is of innate, genetic or developmental origin.

Although math learning difficulties do occur in children with low [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]s,<ref name = "Geary, 2009">{{cite journal| author = Geary DC, Bailey DH, Littlefield A, Wood P, Hoard MK, Nugent L. | year = 2009 | title = First-Grade Predictors of Mathematical Learning Disability: A Latent Class Trajectory Analysis | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pmid = 20046817| doi = 10.1016/j.cogdev.2009.10.001| pmc = 2813681| pages = 411–429| unused_data = pii: 4}}</ref> dyscalculia also affects people from across the whole IQ range, and sufferers often, but not always, also have difficulties with time, measurement, and [[Three-dimensional space|spatial]] reasoning.<ref name = "Butterworth, 2010">{{cite journal | author = Butterworth B. | year = 2010 | title = Foundational numerical capacities and the origins of dyscalculia |journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 14 | issue = 12 | pages = 534–541 | pmid = 20971676 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2010.09.007}}</ref><ref name = "Butterworth, 2011">{{cite journal | author = Butterworth B, Varma S, Laurillard D. | year = 2011 | title = Dyscalculia: from brain to education | journal = Science | volume = 332 | issue = 6033 | pages = 1049–1053 | pmid = 21617068 | doi = 10.1126/science.1201536}}</ref>  Estimates of the prevalence of dyscalculia range between 3 and 6% of the population.<ref name = "Butterworth, 2010" /><ref name = "Butterworth, 2011" />

==History==
The term dates back to at least 1949.<ref name="Pollak2009">{{cite book|author=David Pollak|title=Neurodiversity in higher education: positive responses to specific learning differences|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eVhQoqboi1UC&pg=PA125|accessdate=28 June 2010|date=5 March 2009|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-470-99753-6|pages=125–}}</ref><ref>Kosc, Ladislav, 1974, "[http://ldx.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/7/3/164 Developmental dyscalculia]," ''Journal of Learning Disabilities'' 7" 159-62.</ref>

Mental disabilities specific to maths were originally identified in case studies with patients who suffered specific arithmetic disabilities as a result of damage to specific regions of the brain.  More commonly, dyscalculia occurs developmentally, as a genetically linked learning disability which affects a person's ability to understand, remember, or manipulate numbers or number facts (e.g., the [[multiplication table]]s). The term is often used to refer specifically to the inability to perform arithmetic operations, but it is also defined by some educational professionals and [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]] such as [[Stanislas Dehaene]]<ref name = Dehaene1997>{{cite book | author = Dehaene, S. | year = 1997 | title = The Number Sense: How the Mind Creates Mathematics | location = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-513240-3}}</ref> and [[Brian Butterworth]]<ref name = "Butterworth, 2011" /> as a more fundamental inability to conceptualize numbers as abstract concepts of comparative quantities (a deficit in "[[number sense]]"), which these researchers consider to be a foundational skill, upon which other maths abilities build.<ref name = "Butterworth, 2010" /><ref name = "Butterworth, 2011" />

==Etymology==
Dyscalculia comes from [[greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] which means: "counting badly". The prefix "dys" comes from Greek and means "badly". "Calculia" comes from the Latin "calculare", which means "to count". The word "calculare" comes from "[[calculus]]" (the [[diminutive]] of "calx", which means stone), which means "pebble" or one of the counters on an [[abacus]].

==Symptoms==
The earliest symptom of dyscalculia to appear is a deficit in [[subitizing]].  Subitizing is the ability to know, from a brief glance and without counting, how many objects there are in a small group.  This is an innate ability, present in human infants from birth.  Homologous circuits exist in primates, and many other animals have been shown to possess similar ability; obviously, there is survival value in knowing how many predators there are etc.  Human infants can typically subitize three objects, and this number grows as the person matures, so that most adults can subitize 5 or more objects.  However, children with dyscalculia can subitize fewer objects and even when correct take longer to identify the number than their age-matched peers.<ref>Fischer, Gebhardt, Hartnegg "[http://www.optomlab.com/pubs/index.htm]," ''Optometry & Vision Develop.'' 39" 24-29.</ref> Other symptoms include difficulty reading analog clocks,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Posner |first1=Tamar  |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |coauthors= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Dyscalculic in the making: Mathematical sovereignty, neurological citizenship, and the realities of the dyscalculic |trans_title= |url= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2008 |month= |origyear= |publisher= Publisher ProQuest  |location= |language= |isbn= 978-1-109-09629-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |at= |trans_chapter= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}</ref> and in extreme cases inability to even simply state which of two numbers is larger.

* Frequent difficulties with arithmetic
* Difficulty with everyday tasks like reading analog clocks
* Inability to comprehend financial planning or budgeting, sometimes even at a basic level; for example, estimating the cost of the items in a shopping basket or balancing a checkbook
* Difficulty with multiplication-tables, and subtraction-tables, addition tables, division tables, mental arithmetic, etc.
* Difficulty with conceptualizing time and judging the passing of time. May be chronically late or early<ref>Web columnist Penelope Trunk describes many symptons of the disorder, including this one, in a blog post about How To Ask For Help.[http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2013/01/27/heres-how-to-ask-for-help/]</ref>
* Problems with differentiating between left and right
* Inability to visualize mentally
* Difficulty reading musical notation
* Might do exceptionally well in a writing-related field — authors and journalists are more likely than average to have the disorder{{dubious|date=December 2011}}{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}
* Difficulty navigating or mentally "turning" the map to face the current direction rather than the common North=Top usage
* Having particular difficulty mentally estimating the measurement of an object or distance (e.g., whether something is 10 or 20 feet (3 or 6 meters) away).
* Often unable to grasp and remember mathematical concepts, rules, formulae, and sequences
* Inability to concentrate on mentally intensive tasks
* Low latent inhibition, i.e. over-sensitivity to noise, smell, light and the inability to tune out, filtering unwanted information or impressions. Might have a well-developed sense of imagination due to this (possibly as cognitive compensation to mathematical–numeric deficits)
* Mistaken recollection of names. Poor name/face retrieval. May substitute names beginning with same letter.<ref>http://www.as.wvu.edu/~scidis/dyscalcula.html</ref>

==Causes==
Scientists have yet to understand the causes of dyscalculia. They have been investigating in several domains.
* Neurological: Dyscalculia has been associated with lesions to the [[Brodmann area 40|supramarginal]] and [[angular gyrus|angular gyri]] at the junction between the [[temporal lobe|temporal]] and [[parietal lobe]]s of the [[cerebral cortex]].<ref name="Levy, 1999">{{cite journal |author=Levy LM, Reis IL, Grafman J |title=Metabolic abnormalities detected by 1H-MRS in dyscalculia and dysgraphia |journal=Neurology |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=639–41 |year=1999 |month=August |pmid=10449137 |doi= |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10449137}}</ref><ref name="Mayer, 1999">{{cite journal |author=Mayer E, Martory MD, Pegna AJ, Landis T, Delavelle J, Annoni JM |title=A pure case of Gerstmann syndrome with a subangular lesion |journal=Brain |volume=122 |issue= 6|pages=1107–20 |year=1999 |month=June |pmid=10356063 |doi= 10.1093/brain/122.6.1107|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10356063}}</ref>

* Deficits in [[working memory]]: Adams and Hitch argue that working memory is a major factor in mental addition.<ref name="pmid9344485">{{cite journal |author=Adams JW, Hitch GJ |title=Working memory and children's mental addition |journal=J Exp Child Psychol |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=21–38 |year=1997 |month=October |pmid=9344485 |doi=10.1006/jecp.1997.2397 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-0965(97)92397-3}}</ref> From this base, Geary conducted a study that suggested there was a working memory deficit for those who suffered from dyscalculia.<ref name="Geary, 1993">{{cite journal |author=Geary DC |title=Mathematical disabilities: cognitive, neuropsychological, and genetic components |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=114 |issue=2 |pages=345–62 |year=1993 |month=September |pmid=8416036 |doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.114.2.345|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/bul/114/2/345}}</ref> However, working memory problems are confounded with general learning difficulties, thus Geary's findings may not be specific to dyscalculia but rather may reflect a greater learning deficit.

Other causes may be:

* Short-term memory being disturbed or reduced, making it difficult to remember calculations.
* [[Congenital]] or [[hereditary disorder]]s. Studies show indications of this,<ref name="pmid15727331">{{cite journal |author=Monuteaux MC, Faraone SV, Herzig K, Navsaria N, Biederman J |title=ADHD and dyscalculia: Evidence for independent familial transmission |journal=J Learn Disabil |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=86–93 |year=2005 |pmid=15727331 |doi= 10.1177/00222194050380010701|url=http://ldx.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15727331}}</ref> but the evidence is not yet concrete.
*[[Gerstmann syndrome]]: dyscalculia is one of a constellation of symptoms acquired after damage to the [[angular gyrus]].

Involvement of the [[intraparietal sulcus]] has been suggested.<ref name="Rubinsten, 2009">{{cite journal |author=Rubinsten O, Henik A |title=Developmental dyscalculia: heterogeneity might not mean different mechanisms |journal=Trends Cogn. Sci. (Regul.

==Comorbid conditions==
*A quarter of children with dyscalculia have [[ADHD]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Shalev|first=Ruth|title=Developmental Dyscalculia|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:RXBP1-3FuyoJ:www.phoenixchildrens.com/physician-network/medical-specialties/developmental-pediatrics/pdfs/Dyscalculia-6.pdf+&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESggp9q8jHhzglAJDY8mrXHl4j70x3uOvx7WqkGzGadSKpGRm21jYhWlrKfQZ3apima05ZkXSNOPW0bUDELA7c1bnYhKf4fltUUyathKbJvyiJyjBRXZb89lNaJn4-Lgs5Ghz6yN&sig=AHIEtbSDxGH7ttlxaDKyAuSAnETq96133A}}</ref> 


==Treatment==
Software intended to remediate dyscalculia has been developed.<ref name="=Wilson, 2006">{{cite journal |author=Wilson AJ, Revkin SK, Cohen D, Cohen L, Dehaene S |title=An open trial assessment of "The Number Race", an adaptive computer game for remediation of dyscalculia |journal=Behav Brain Funct |volume=2 |issue= |pages=20 |year=2006 |pmid=16734906 |pmc=1523349 |doi=10.1186/1744-9081-2-20 |url=http://www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com/content/2//20}}</ref>

Forms of [[educational therapy]], such as neuro-sensory educational therapy, can be an effective treatment.

A study used transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) to the parietal lobe during numerical learning and demonstrated selective improvement of  numerical abilities that was still present six months later.<ref name="Cohen, 2010">{{cite journal|last1=Cohen Kadosh|first1=Roi |last2=Soskic |first2=Sonja|last3=Iuculano|first3=Teresa|last4=Kanai|first4=Ryota|last5=Walsh|first5=Vincent|title=Modulating Neuronal Activity Produces Specific and Long-Lasting Changes in Numerical Competence|journal=Current Biology|volume=20|issue=22|year=2010|pages=2016–2020|issn=09609822|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.10.007 |url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822%2810%2901234-0 Modulating Neuronal Activity Produces Specific and Long-Lasting Changes in Numerical Competence}}</ref>
