In [[biology]], an '''endosome''' is a membrane-bound compartment inside [[eukaryotic cells]].  It is a compartment of the [[Endocytosis|endocytic]] membrane transport pathway from the [[plasma membrane]] to the [[lysosome]].  Molecules internalized from the plasma membrane can follow this pathway all the way to lysosomes for degradation, or they can be recycled back to the plasma membrane.  Molecules are also transported to endosomes from the [[golgi apparatus|Golgi]] and either continue to lysosomes or recycle back to the Golgi.  Furthermore, molecules can be directed into vesicles that bud from the perimeter membrane into the endosome lumen.  Therefore, endosomes represent a major sorting compartment of the [[endomembrane system]] in cells.<ref name="endo1">{{cite journal

== Function ==
Endosomes provide an environment for material to be sorted before it reaches the degradative lysosome.<ref name="endo1" />  For example, [[LDL]] is taken into the cell by binding the [[LDL receptor]] at the cell surface.  On reaching early endosomes, the LDL dissociates from the receptor, and the receptor can be recycled to the cell surface.  The LDL remains in the endosome and is delivered to lysosomes for processing.  LDL dissociates because of the slightly acidified environment of the early endosome, generated by a vacuolar membrane proton pump [[V-ATPase]]. On the other hand, EGF and the EGF receptor have a pH-resistant bond that persists until it is delivered to lysosomes for their degradation. The [[mannose 6-phosphate receptor]] carries [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] from the Golgi destined for the lysosome by a similar mechanism.

== Types ==
Endosomes comprise three different compartments: ''early endosomes'', ''late endosomes'', and ''recycling endosomes''.<ref name="endo1" />  They are distinguished by the time it takes for endocytosed material to reach them, and by markers such as [[Rab (G-protein)|rabs]].<ref name="Stenmark-2009">{{Cite journal

Late endosomes/MVBs are sometimes called ''endocytic carrier vesicles'', but this term was used to describe vesicles that bud from early endosomes and fuse with late endosomes.  However, several observations (described above) have now demonstrated that it is more likely that transport between these two compartments occurs by a maturation process, rather than vesicle transport.

==Pathways==
[[File:Endocytic pathway of animal cells showing EGF receptors, transferrin receptors and mannose-6-phosphate receptors.jpg|thumb|315px|alt=animal cell endocytic pathway|Diagram of the pathways that intersect endosomes in the endocytic pathway of animal cells. Examples of molecules that follow some of the pathways are shown, including receptors for EGF, transferrin, and lysosomal hydrolases. Recycling endosomes, and compartments and pathways found in more specialized cells, are not shown.]]
There are three main compartments that have pathways that connect with endosomes.  More pathways exist in specialized cells, such as [[melanocytes]] and polarized cells.  For example, in [[epithelium|epithelial]] cells, a special process called transcytosis allows some materials to enter one side of a cell and exit from the opposite side. Also, in some circumstances, late endosomes/MVBs fuse with the plasma membrane instead of with lysosomes, releasing the lumenal vesicles, now called [[Exosome (vesicle)|exosomes]], into the extracellular medium.

It should be noted that there is no consensus as to the exact nature of these pathways, and the sequential route taken by any given cargo in any given situation will tend to be a matter of debate.

===Golgi to/from endosomes===

Vesicles pass between the Golgi and endosomes in both directions.  The [[GGA1|GGAs]] and [[AP1G1|AP-1]] [[clathrin-coated vesicle]] adaptors make vesicles at the Golgi that carry molecules to endosomes.<ref name="Ghosh-2004">{{Cite journal

}}</ref>  In the opposite direction, [[retromer]] generates vesicles at early endosomes that carry molecules back to the Golgi. Some studies describe a retrograde traffic pathway from late endosomes to the Golgi that is mediated by [[Rab9]] and [[TIP47]], but other studies dispute these findings.  Molecules that follow these pathways include the mannose-6-phosphate receptors that carry lysosomal hydrolases to the endocytic pathway.  The hydrolases are released in the acidic environment of endosomes, and the receptor is retrieved to the Golgi by retromer and Rab9.

===Plasma membrane to/from early endosomes (via recycling endosomes)===

Molecules are delivered from the plasma membrane to early endosomes in [[endocytosis|endocytic]] vesicles.  Molecules can be internalized via [[receptor-mediated endocytosis]] in [[clathrin]]-coated vesicles.   Other types of vesicles also form at the plasma membrane for this pathway, including ones utilising [[caveolae|caveolin]].  Vesicles also transport molecules directly back to the plasma membrane, but many molecules are transported in vesicles that first fuse with recycling endosomes.<ref name="Grant-2009">{{Cite journal

}}</ref>  Molecules following this recycling pathway are concentrated in the tubules of early endosomes. Molecules that follow these pathways include the [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] for [[LDL]], the growth hormone [[Epidermal growth factor|EGF]], and the iron transport protein transferrin.  Internalization of these receptors from the plasma membrane occurs by receptor-mediated endocytosis.  LDL is released in endosomes because of the lower pH, and the receptor is recycled to the cell surface.   [[Cholesterol]] is carried in the blood primarily by (LDL), and transport by the LDL receptor is the main mechanism by which cholesterol is taken up by cells.  EGFRs are activated when EGF binds.  The activated receptors stimulate their own internalization and degradation in lysosomes.  EGF remains bound to the [[EGF receptor|EGFR]] once it is endocytosed to endosomes.  The activated EGFRs stimulate their own ubiquitination, and this directs them to lumenal vesicles (see below) and so they are not recycled to the plasma membrane.

===Late endosomes to lysosomes===

Transport from late endosomes to lysosomes is, in essence, unidirectional, since a late endosome is "consumed" in the process of fusing with a lysosome.  Hence, soluble molecules in the lumen of endosomes will tend to end up in lysosomes, unless they are retrieved in some way.  [[Transmembrane protein]]s can be delivered to the perimeter membrane or the lumen of lysosomes.  Transmembrane proteins destined for the lysosome lumen are sorted into the vesicles that bud from the perimeter membrane into endosomes, a process that begins in early endosomes.  When the endosome has matured into a late endosome/MVB and fuses with a lysosome, the vesicles in the lumen are delivered to the lysosome lumen.  Proteins are marked for this pathway by the addition of [[ubiquitin]].<ref name="Hicke-2003">{{Cite journal
