Three '''common palmar digital arteries''' arise from the [[wikt:convex|convexity]] of the [[superficial palmar arch]] and proceed [[distal]]ly on the second, third, and fourth [[lumbricals of the hand|lumbricales]] muscles. 

Alternative names for these arteries are:<ref>[http://focosi.immunesig.org/circulation.html Physiology of adult Homo sapiens - Systemic blood and lymph circulation (angiology)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  '''common volar digital arteries''',<ref>''Palmar'' and ''volar'' may be used [[synonym]]ously, but ''volar'' is less common.</ref> '''ulnar metacarpal arteries''', '''arteriae digitales palmares communes''',<ref>This is the official and international [[Latin]] term as defined by the [[Terminologia Anatomica]] (TA), but in English speaking countries and especially the US, ''common palmar digital arteries'' is more commonly used.</ref> or '''aa. digitales volares communes'''.<ref>Again, ''palmar'' and ''volar'' may be used synonymously, but ''aa. digitales volares communes'' does not occur in the TA, and can therefore be considered deprecated.</ref>

Each of these arteries receive the corresponding [[volar metacarpal artery]] and then divide into a pair of [[proper palmar digital arteries]] ([[q.v.]]).
