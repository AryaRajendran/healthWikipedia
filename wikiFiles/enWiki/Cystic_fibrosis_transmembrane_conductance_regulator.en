=== Mutations ===
Well over one thousand [[mutation]]s have been described that can affect the CFTR gene. Such mutations  can cause two genetic disorders, [[congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens]] and the more widely known disorder [[cystic fibrosis]]. Both disorders arise from the blockage of the movement of ions and, therefore, water into and out of cells. In congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens, the protein may be still functional but not at normal efficiency, this leads to the production of thick [[mucus]], which blocks the developing [[vas deferens]]. In people with mutations giving rise to cystic fibrosis, the blockage in ion  transport occurs in epithelial cells that line the passageways of the [[lungs]], [[pancreas]], and other organs. This leads to chronic dysfunction, disability, and  a reduced life expectancy. 

The most common mutation, [[ΔF508]] results from a deletion (Δ) of three nucleotides which results in a loss of the amino acid [[phenylalanine]] (F) at the 508th position on the protein. As a result the protein does not [[Protein folding|fold]] normally and is more quickly degraded.  

The vast majority of mutations are quite rare. The distribution and frequency of mutations varies among different populations which has implications for genetic screening and counseling.

Mutations consist of  replacements, duplications,  deletions or shortenings in the CFTR gene. This may result in proteins that may not function, work less effectively, are more quickly degraded, or are present in inadequate numbers.<ref name="pmid15888700">{{cite journal | author = Rowe SM, Miller S, Sorscher EJ | title = Cystic fibrosis | journal = N.

It has been hypothesized that mutations in the CFTR gene may confer a selective advantage to heterozygous individuals.  Cells expressing a mutant form of the CFTR protein are resistant to invasion by the ''Salmonella typhi'' bacterium, the agent of typhoid fever, and mice carrying a single copy of mutant CFTR are resistant to diarrhea caused by cholera toxin.{{pmid =11138935}}

== Structure ==

The CFTR gene is approximately 189 [[Kilobase pair|kb]] in length, with 27 exons and 28 intons<ref name="CFMD">{{cite journal | author = Cystic Fibrosis Mutation Database | title = Genomic DNA sequence | url = http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/GenomicDnaSequencePage.html }}</ref>. CFTR is a [[glycoprotein]] with 1480 [[amino acid]]s. The protein consists of five domains. There are two transmembrane domains, each with six spans of [[Alpha helix|alpha helices]]. These are each connected to a [[nucleotide binding domain]] (NBD) in the cytoplasm. The first NBD is connected to the second transmembrane domain by a regulatory "R" domain that is a unique feature of CFTR, not present in other [[ATP-binding cassette transporter|ABC transporters]]. The ion channel only opens when its R-domain has been phosphorylated by PKA and  [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is bound at the NBDs.<ref name="pmid9922375">{{cite journal | author = Sheppard DN, Welsh MJ | title = Structure and function of the CFTR chloride channel | journal = Physiol.

== Location and function ==

CFTR functions as a [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]]-activated [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-[[gated]] [[anion]] [[Ion channel|channel]], increasing the [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] for certain [[anions]] (e.g. Cl<sup>–</sup>) to flow down their [[electrochemical gradient]]. ATP-driven [[conformational change]]s in CFTR open and close a gate to allow transmembrane flow of anions down their [[electrochemical gradient]].<ref name="The ABC protein turned chloride channel whose failure causes cystic fibrosis">{{Cite pmid|16554808}}</ref>  This in contrast to other [[ABC proteins]], in which ATP-driven conformational changes fuel uphill substrate transport across cellular membranes.  Essentially, CFTR is an ion channel that evolved as a 'broken' [[ABC transporter]] that leaks when in open [[Chemical structure|conformation]].  

The CFTR is found in the epithelial cells of many organs including the [[lung]], [[liver]], [[pancreas]], [[digestive]] tract, [[reproductive]] tract, and [[skin]]. Normally, the protein moves [[chloride]] and [[thiocyanate]]<ref name="pmid17082494">{{cite journal | author = Moskwa P, Lorentzen D, Excoffon KJ, Zabner J, McCray PB, Nauseef WM, Dupuy C, Bánfi B | title = A novel host defense system of airways is defective in cystic fibrosis | journal = Am.

Positively charged sodium ions follow these anions out of the cell to maintain electrical balance.  This increases the total [[electrolyte]] concentration in the mucus, resulting in the movement of water out of cell by [[osmosis]].  

In epithelial cells with motile cilia lining the bronchus and the oviduct, CFTR is located on cell membrane but not on cilia. In contrast to CFTR, [[ENaC]] is located along the entire length of the cilia.<ref name="pmid22207244">{{cite journal |author=Enuka Y, Hanukoglu I, Edelheit O, Vaknine H, Hanukoglu A |title=Epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) are uniformly distributed on motile cilia in the oviduct and the respiratory airways |journal=Histochem Cell Biol [Epub ahead of print] |year=2011 |pmid=22207244 |doi= 10.1007/s00418-011-0904-1 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/48n868q22535vn05/ |volume=137 |issue=3 |pages=339–53}}</ref> These findings contradict a previous hypothesis that CFTR normally downregulates ENaC by direct interaction and that in CF patients, CFTR cannot downregulate ENaC causing hyper-absorption in the lungs and recurrent lung infections.

* [[Congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens]]: Males with congenital bilateral absence of the [[vas deferens]] most often have a mild [[mutation]] (a change that allows partial function of the gene) in one copy of the CFTR gene and a cystic fibrosis-causing mutation in the other copy of CFTR. As a result of these mutations, the movement of water and salt into and out of cells is disrupted. This disturbance leads to the production of a large amount of thick mucus that blocks the developing vas deferens (a tube that carries sperm from the testes) and causes it to degenerate, resulting in infertility.<ref name="pmid15379964">{{cite journal | author=Cuppens H, Cassiman JJ | title=CFTR mutations and polymorphisms in male infertility | journal=Int J Androl | year=2004 | pages=251–6 | volume=27 | issue=5  | pmid=15379964 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2605.2004.00485.x}}</ref>

* [[Cystic fibrosis]]: More than 1,700 mutations in the CFTR gene have been found but the majority of these have not been associated with cystic fibrosis{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Most of these mutations either substitute one [[amino acid]] (a building block of proteins) for another amino acid in the CFTR protein or delete a small amount of [[DNA]] in the CFTR gene. The most common mutation, called [[ΔF508]], is a deletion (Δ) of one amino acid (phenylalanine) at position 508 in the CFTR protein. This altered protein never reaches the cell membrane because it is degraded shortly after it is made. All disease-causing mutations in the CFTR gene prevent the channel from functioning properly, leading to a blockage of the movement of salt and water into and out of cells. As a result of this blockage, cells that line the passageways of the lungs, pancreas, and other organs produce abnormally thick, sticky mucus. This mucus obstructs the airways and glands, causing the characteristic signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis. In addition, only thin mucus can be removed by [[cilium|cilia]], thick mucus cannot, so it traps bacteria that give rise to chronic infections.

In Cholera, the CFTR channel is up-regulated by cAMP. Cholera toxin permanently activates adenylyl cyclase, resulting in increased cAMP, resulting in oversecretion of Cl-.
