A '''contraceptive mandate''' is a state or federal regulation or law that requires health insurers, or employers that provide their employees with health insurance, to include [[contraception]] in their health insurance plans. Many states in the US have such mandates, and the Obama administration has proposed a federal mandate to apply to all new health insurance plans in all states from August 1, 2012.<ref>"As of 2012, 28 states have passed laws that require insurers that cover prescription drugs in general to provide coverage of the full range of FDA-approved contraceptive drugs and devices."

===Federal contraception mandate===
On January 20, 2012, [[Health and Human Services]]' Secretary [[Kathleen Sebelius]] announced the mandate requiring that all health plans provide coverage at no cost (including deductibles and co-payments) for all contraceptives approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] as part of preventive health services for women.<ref>{{cite web | title=Preventive Services Covered Under the Affordable Care Act | url=http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/2010/07/preventive-services-list.html}}</ref> The mandate also required coverage for sterilizations.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/a-whopper-ad-for-john-boehners-gop-opponent/2012/03/07/gIQAhS7JxR_blog.html ''The Washington Post'': The Fact Checker: "A whopper ad for John Boehner’s GOP opponent" by Josh Hicks] March 8, 2012</ref>

The administration allowed a religious exemption.  The exemption applies to church organizations themselves, but not to affiliated nonprofit corporations, like hospitals, that do not rely primarily on members of the faith as employees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Contraception and Insurance Coverage (Religious Exemption Debate)|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/health_care_reform/contraception/index.html|publisher=THe New York Times|accessdate=16 July 2012}}</ref>  An amendment, the Blunt Amendment, was proposed that "would have allowed employers to refuse to include contraception in health care coverage if it violated their religious or moral beliefs,"<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/03/womens-health-vs-religious-freedom-house-leaders-debate-birth-control-mandate/ Women’s Health vs. Religious Freedom: House Leaders Debate Birth Control Mandate]</ref> but it was voted down 51-48 by the U.S. Senate on March 1, 2012.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/03/contraception-mandate-goes-up-for-a-vote/ Senate Blocks Blunt’s Repeal of Contraception Mandate]</ref>

===PPACA Coverage for contraceptives===
With the exception of churches and houses of worship, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] mandates contraceptive coverage for all employers and educational institutions, even though the mandate itself is not included in the wording of the law(s) [http://www.healthcare.gov/law/full/] passed by Congress. The mandate applies to all new health insurance plans effective August 2012. It controversially includes Christian hospitals, [[Catholic Charities|Christian charities]], [[List of Roman Catholic universities and colleges in the United States|Catholic universities]], and other enterprises owned or controlled by religious organizations that oppose contraception on doctrinal grounds. Regulations<ref name="Final Rule">{{cite web|title=Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – Final Rules|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/FR-2012-02-15/2012-3547/content-detail.html|publisher=Federal Register, GPO|accessdate=February 15, 2012|author=Dept.

In February 2012, a major political controversy erupted with [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|candidates for the Republican nomination for President]] viewing the regulations as a "direct attack on religious liberty".<ref name=NYTGrady>{{cite news|title=Ruling on Contraception Draws Battle Lines at Catholic Colleges|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/30/health/policy/law-fuels-contraception-controversy-on-catholic-campuses|accessdate=February 12, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 29, 2012|author=Denise Grady}}</ref> However, certain aspects of the mandate are not new. In December 2000, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] ruled that companies that provided prescription drugs to their employees but didn't provide birth control were in violation of [[Title VII|Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act]], which prevents discrimination on the basis of sex. That opinion, which the George W. Bush administration did nothing to alter or withdraw when it took office the next month, is still in effect today – and because it relies on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, it applies to all employers with 15 or more employees. Currently, employers that don't offer prescription coverage or don't offer insurance at all are exempt, because they treat men and women equal, but the new mandate will penalize such actions.

After the EEOC opinion was approved in 2000, reproductive rights groups and employees who wanted birth control access sued employers that refused to comply. The next year, in Erickson v. Bartell Drug Co., a federal court agreed with the EEOC's reasoning. Reproductive rights groups and others used that decision as leverage to force other companies to settle lawsuits and agree to change their insurance plans to include birth control. Some subsequent court decisions echoed Erickson, and some went the other way, but the rule (absent a Supreme Court decision) remained, and over the following decade, the percentage of employer-based plans offering contraceptive coverage tripled to 90 percent.<ref>{{cite news|title=Most of Obama's "Controversial" Birth Control Rule Was Law During Bush Years|url=http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/02/controversial-obama-birth-control-rule-already-law|accessdate=May 26, 2012|magazine=Mother Jones|date=February 8, 2012|author=Nick Baumann}}</ref>

The [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] has since taken the lead in opposition to the regulations<ref>{{cite news|title=Bishops Reject White House's New Plan on Contraception|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/us/catholic-bishops-criticize-new-contraception-proposal.html|accessdate=February 12, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 11, 2012|author=Laurie Goodstein}}</ref> Cardinal [[Timothy M. Dolan]], the [[archbishop of New York]] and president of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] stated that the provision "represents a challenge and a compromise of our religious liberty".<ref name=USCCB>{{cite web |url=http://www.usccb.org/news/2012/12-012.cfm |title=U.S. Bishops Vow To Fight HHS Edict |date=January 20, 2012 |publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops |accessdate=February 8, 2012}}</ref> Other organizations, such as [[Planned Parenthood]], supported the provision.<ref name="sun compromise" /> The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, The Presbyterian Church (USA), Reform Judaism, the United Methodist Church, and the United Church of Christ all have said they support the Mandate and all offer these products on their health plans. 

The regulations issued under the act are also opposed by active Christian [[Evangelicals]].<ref name=NYTAll>{{cite news|title=Both Sides Eager to Take Birth Control Coverage Issue to Voters|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/us/politics/both-sides-eager-to-take-contraception-mandate-debate-to-voters.html|accessdate=February 16, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 15, 2012|author=Erik Eckholm|quote=Is it about religious liberty or women's health?}}</ref>

The Obama administration proposed changes in response to the criticism. Under the proposed new regulation, birth control medication would be provided by the insurers, without direct involvement by the religious organization. The [[Catholic Health Association of the United States|Catholic Health Association]] (CHA) accepted this compromise. Although initially more supportive, Sister [[Carol Keehan]], CEO of the CHA, registered opposition in a five-page letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/course-correction-sister-carol-keehan-now-opposes-obama-accommodation-for-h |title= Course Correction: Sister Carol Keehan Now Opposes Obama 'Accommodation' for HHS Mandate |author= Joan Frawley Desmond |date= June 18, 2012 |work= [[National Catholic Register]] |accessdate= July 2, 2012}}</ref> The vice president of Catholic identity and mission at [[Mount St. Mary's University]], [[Stuart Swetland]], said, "It shows [Obama] and the administration are listening to our concerns", but reserved the right to "examine the details". However, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops continued to oppose the regulation, saying that the regulation still requires Catholics in the insurance industry to violate their consciences.<ref name="sun compromise">{{cite news

====Framing the issue====
{{See also|War on Women}}
Some people see the matter as primarily one of [[women's health]], such as the [[National Women's Law Center]].<ref>[http://www.nwlc.org/resource/denying-coverage-contraceptives-harms-women Denying Coverage of Contraceptives Harms Women]</ref> Others see it as a matter of [[religious freedom]]. 

Certain consumers of mandatory health insurance, such as students matriculated at colleges of further education, have criticized what they perceive to be discrimination in provision or in practice: employer-provided plans that cover University faculty and staff may be subject to legal mandates whereas plans that cover the student body may not. [[Sandra Fluke]] was invited to present oral arguments on behalf of certain female student consumers dissatisfied with restrictions attached to registration for undergraduate and graduate attendance at Georgetown University School of Law. No contraceptive mandate applies to private parties entering into an association for commercial gain. Students are only required to purchase the University's plan if they are not covered elsewhere, for example under a family members' (parents, spouse) plan. or are able to demonstrate their ability to self-insure at equivalent policy limits for certain levels of medical care.

Sen. [[Frank Lautenberg]] (D-NJ), opposing the Blunt Amendment's limitations on contraception availability, said, "The Republicans want to take us forward to the Dark Ages again... when women were property."<ref>[http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/213615-senate-rejects-blunt-amendment-to-kill-birth-control-mandate The Hill: Senate rejects Blunt amendment to limit birth-control mandate]</ref>
