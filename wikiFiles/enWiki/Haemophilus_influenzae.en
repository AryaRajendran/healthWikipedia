'''''Haemophilus influenzae''''', formerly called '''Pfeiffer's bacillus''' or '''''Bacillus influenzae''''', is a [[Gram-negative]], [[Bacillus (shape)|coccobacilli]] [[bacterium]] first described in 1892 by [[Richard Friedrich Johannes Pfeiffer|Richard Pfeiffer]] during an [[influenza]] [[pandemic]]. A member of the ''[[Pasteurellaceae]]'' family, it is generally [[aerobic organism|aerobic]], but can grow as a [[facultative anaerobe]].<ref name= KuhnertChristensen>{{cite book | author = Kuhnert P; Christensen H (editors). | title = Pasteurellaceae: Biology, Genomics and Molecular Aspects | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 |  isbn =  978-1-904455-34-9 }}</ref> 

''H. influenzae'' was mistakenly considered to be the cause of [[influenza]] until 1933, when the viral [[etiology]] of [[Influenza|influenza]] became apparent. The bacterium is colloquially known as ''bacterial influenza''. Still, ''H. influenzae'' is responsible for a wide range of clinical diseases.

''H. influenzae'' was the first free-living organism to have its entire [[genome]] sequenced. The sequencing project was completed and published in 1995.

==Serotypes==
In 1930, two major categories of ''H. influenzae'' were defined:  the unencapsulated strains and the encapsulated strains. Encapsulated strains were classified on the basis of their distinct capsular antigens. There are six generally recognized types of encapsulated ''H. influenzae'': a, b, c, d, e, and f.<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ; Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | pages= 396&ndash;401| isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}</ref> 

Genetic diversity among unencapsulated strains is greater than within the encapsulated group.  Unencapsulated strains are termed nontypable (NTHi) because they lack capsular serotypes; however, they can be classified by multilocus sequence typing. The [[pathogenesis]] of ''H. influenzae'' infections is not completely understood, although the presence of the capsule in encapsulated type b (Hib), a serotype causing conditions such as [[epiglottitis]], is known to be a major factor in virulence. Their capsule allows them to resist [[phagocytosis]] and complement-mediated [[lysis]] in the nonimmune host. The unencapsulated strains are almost always less invasive; they can, however, produce an inflammatory response in humans, which can lead to many symptoms. Vaccination with [[Hib vaccine|Hib conjugate vaccine]] is effective in preventing Hib infection, but does not prevent infection with NTHi strains.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Slack|first=MP|coauthors=et al.|title=Enhanced surveillance of invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease in England, 1990 to 1996: impact of conjugate vaccines.|journal=Pediatr Infect Dis J.|year=1998|volume=17|issue=9 suppl|pages=S204-7|pmid=9781764}}</ref>

Most strains of ''H. influenzae'' are opportunistic pathogens; that is, they usually live in their host without causing disease, but cause problems only when other factors (such as a viral infection, reduced immune function or chronically inflamed tissues, e.g. from allergies) create an opportunity. They infect the host by sticking to the host cell using  [[Trimeric Autotransporter Adhesins (TAA)]].

Naturally acquired disease caused by ''H. influenzae'' seems to occur in humans only. In infants and young children, ''H. influenzae'' type b (Hib) causes [[bacteremia]], [[pneumonia]], and acute bacterial [[meningitis]]. On occasion, it causes [[cellulitis]], [[osteomyelitis]], [[epiglottitis]], and [[infectious arthritis]]. In fact, ''Haemophilus influenzae'' is the most common etiologic agent associated with epiglottitis ([[thumbprint sign]] seen on [[X-Ray]]). 

Due to routine use of the Hib conjugate vaccine in the U.S. since 1990, the incidence of invasive Hib disease has decreased to 1.3/100,000 in children. However, Hib remains a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children in developing countries where the vaccine is not widely used. Unencapsulated ''H. influenzae'' strains are unaffected by the Hib vaccine and cause ear infections ([[otitis media]]), eye infections ([[conjunctivitis]]), and [[sinusitis]] in children, and are associated with [[pneumonia]].

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Haemophilus influenzae Gram.JPG|thumb|250px|''H. influenzae'', in a Gram stain of a sputum sample, appear as Gram-negative coccobacilli.<ref>{{cite book |title= Nelson Tratado de Pediatría|last= Behrman|first= Richard E.|authorlink= |coauthors= Robert M Kliegman and Hal B.

[[File:H. influenzae XV.jpg|thumb|250px|''Haemophilus influenzae'' requires X and V factors for growth. In this culture haemophilus has only grown around the paper disc that has been impregnated with X and V factors. There is no bacterial growth around the discs that only contain either X or V factor.]]

Clinical diagnosis of ''H. influenzae'' is typically performed by [[bacterial culture]] or latex particle agglutinations. Diagnosis is considered confirmed when the organism is isolated from a sterile body site.  In this respect, ''H. influenzae'' cultured from the nasopharyngeal cavity or sputum would not indicate ''H. influenzae'' disease, because these sites are colonized in disease-free individuals.<ref name= Puri_1999>{{cite journal |author= Puri J, Talwar V, Juneja M, Agarwal KN, Gupta HC |title= Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among respiratory isolates of Haemophilus influenzae |journal= Indian Pediatr |volume=36 |pages= 1029–32|year=1999|pmid= 10745313 |issue= 10 }}</ref> However, ''H. influenzae'' isolated from cerebrospinal fluid or blood would indicate ''H. influenzae'' infection.

===Culture===
Bacterial culture of ''H. influenzae'' is performed on agar plates, the preferable one being [[chocolate agar]],  with added [[Heamatin|X]](hemin) & [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|V]](NAD) factors at 37°C in a CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched  incubator.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Generic protocol for population-based  surveillance of Haemophilus influenzae type B | year = 2013 | publisher = World Health Organization | id = WHO/VRD/GEN/95.05}}</ref> Blood agar growth is only achieved as a satellite phenomenon around other bacteria.  Colonies of ''H. influenzae'' appear as convex, smooth, pale, grey or transparent colonies.  

[[Gram stain|Gram-stained]] and microscopic observation of a specimen of ''H. influenzae'' will show Gram-negative, rod shaped, with no specific arrangement. The cultured organism can be further characterized using [[catalase]] and [[oxidase]] tests, both of which should be positive. Further serological testing is necessary to distinguish the capsular polysaccharide and differentiate between ''H. influenzae'' b and nonencapsulated species.

Although highly specific, bacterial culture of ''H. influenzae'' lacks in sensitivity. Use of antibiotics prior to sample collection greatly reduces the isolation rate by killing the bacteria before identification is possible.<ref name= John_1991>{{cite journal |author= John TJ, Cherian T, Steinhoff MC, Simoes EA, John M |title= Etiology of acute respiratory infections in children in tropical southern India |journal= Rev Infect Dis |volume=13 |pages= Suppl 6:S463–9 |year=1991 |pmid= 1862277 }}</ref> Beyond this, ''H. influenzae''  is a finicky bacterium to culture, and any modification of culture procedures can greatly reduce isolation rates. Poor quality of laboratories in developing countries has resulted in poor isolation rates of ''H. influenzae''.

H. influenzae will grow in the hemolytic zone of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' on blood agar plates; the hemolysis of cells by ''S. aureus'' releases factor V which is needed for its growth. ''H. influenzae'' will not grow outside the hemolytic zone of ''S. aureus'' due to the lack of nutrients such as factor V in these areas.  Fildes agar is best for isolation.  In Levinthal medium capsulated strains show distinctive iridescence.

===Latex particle agglutination===
The [[latex particle agglutination test]] (LAT) is a more sensitive method to detect ''H. influenzae'' than culture.<ref name= Kennedy_2007>{{cite journal |author= Kennedy WA, Chang SJ, Purdy K, LE T, Kilgore PE, Kim JS et al. |title= Incidence of bacterial meningitis in Asia using enhanced CSF testing: polymerase chain reaction, latex agglutination and culture |journal= Epidemiol Infect |volume=135 |pages= 1217–26 |year=2007 |pmid= 17274856 |doi= 10.1017/S0950268806007734 |issue= 7 |pmc= 2870670 }}</ref> Because the method relies on antigen rather than viable bacteria, the results are not disrupted by prior antibiotic use.  It also has the added benefit of being much quicker than culture methods. However, antibiotic sensitivity testing is not possible with LAT alone, so a parallel culture is necessary.

===Molecular methods===
[[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) assays have been proven to be more sensitive than either LAT or culture tests, and highly specific.<ref name="Kennedy_2007"/> However, PCR assays have not yet become routine in clinical settings.  Countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis has been shown to be an effective research diagnostic method, but has been largely supplanted by PCR.

==Interaction with ''Streptococcus pneumoniae''==
Both ''H. influenzae'' and ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae|S. pneumoniae]]'' can be found in the upper respiratory system of humans.  In an ''in vitro'' study of competition, ''S. pneumoniae'' always overpowered ''H. influenzae'' by attacking it with [[hydrogen peroxide]] and stripping off the surface molecules ''H. influenzae'' needs for survival.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pericone, Christopher D., Overweg, Karin, Hermans, Peter W. M., Weiser, Jeffrey N. |title=Inhibitory and Bactericidal Effects of Hydrogen Peroxide Production by Streptococcus pneumoniae on Other Inhabitants of the Upper Respiratory Tract |journal=Infect Immun |volume=68 |issue=7 |pages=3990&ndash;3997 |year=2000 |pmid=10858213 |doi=10.1128/IAI.68.7.3990-3997.2000 |pmc=101678}}</ref>

When both bacteria are placed together into a nasal cavity, within 2 weeks, only ''H. influenzae'' survives.  When either is placed separately into a nasal cavity, each one survives.  Upon examining the upper respiratory tissue from mice exposed to both bacteria species, an extraordinarily large number of [[neutrophils]] (immune cells) was found.  In mice exposed to only one bacterium, the cells were not present.

Lab tests showed neutrophils exposed to dead ''H. influenzae'' were more aggressive in attacking ''S. pneumoniae'' than unexposed neutrophils.  Exposure to dead ''H. influenzae'' had no effect on live ''H. influenzae''.

Two scenarios may be responsible for this response:

# When ''H. influenzae'' is attacked by ''S. pneumoniae'', it signals the immune system to attack the ''S. pneumoniae''
# The combination of the two species triggers an immune system response that is not set off by either species individually.

It is unclear why ''H. influenzae'' is not affected by the immune response.<ref name=Lysenko_2005>{{cite journal |author=Lysenko E, Ratner A, Nelson A, Weiser J |title=The role of innate immune responses in the outcome of interspecies competition for colonization of mucosal surfaces |journal=PLoS Pathog |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=e1 |year=2005 |pmid=16201010 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0010001 |pmc=1238736}}</ref>

==Treatment==
''Haemophilus influenzae'' produces beta-lactamases, and it is also able to modify its [[penicillin-binding proteins]], so it has gained resistance to the penicillin family of antibiotics.
In severe cases, [[cefotaxime]] and [[ceftriaxone]] delivered directly into the bloodstream are the elected antibiotics, and, for the less severe cases, an association of [[ampicillin]] and [[sulbactam]], [[cephalosporins]] of the second and third generation, or [[fluoroquinolones]] are preferred. (Fluoroquinolone-resistant Haemophilus influenzae has been observed.)<ref name="pmid20356651">{{cite journal |author=Chang CM, Lauderdale TL, Lee HC, ''et al.'' |title=Colonisation of fluoroquinolone-resistant Haemophilus influenzae among nursing home residents in southern Taiwan |journal=J. Hosp. Infect. |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=304–8 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20356651 |doi=10.1016/j.jhin.2009.12.020 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0195-6701(10)00014-9}}</ref>

Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., [[clarithromycin]]) may be used in patients with a history of allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Macrolide resistance has also been observed.<ref name="pmid21081549">{{cite journal |author=Roberts MC, Soge OO, No DB |title=Characterization of macrolide resistance genes in Haemophilus influenzae isolated from children with cystic fibrosis |journal=J.

==Prevention==
Effective [[Hib vaccine|vaccines for ''Haemophilus influenzae'']] Type B have been available since the early 1990s, and is recommended for children under age 5 and asplenic patients. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends a pentavalent vaccine, combining vaccines against [[diphtheria]], [[tetanus]], [[pertussis]], [[hepatitis B]] and Hib. There is not yet sufficient evidence on how effective this pentavalent vaccine is in relation to the individual vaccines.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bar-On ES, Goldberg E, Hellmann S, Leibovici L |title=Combined DTP-HBV-HIB vaccine versus separately administered DTP-HBV and HIB vaccines for primary prevention of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae B (HIB) |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=4 |pages=CD005530 |year=2012 |pmid=22513932 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005530.pub3}}</ref> 

Hib vaccines cost about seven times the total cost of vaccines against measles, polio, tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. Consequently, whereas 92% of the populations of developed countries was vaccinated against Hib as of 2003, vaccination coverage was 42% for developing countries, and only 8% for least-developed countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allcountries.org/health/haemophilus_influenzae_type_b_hib.html |title=Haemophilus influenzae type B (HiB) |work=Health Topics A to Z |accessdate=2011-03-29}}</ref>

==Sequencing==
''H. influenzae'' was the first free-living organism to have its entire genome sequenced.  Completed by Craig Venter and his team, ''Haemophilus'' was chosen because one of the project leaders, Nobel laureate [[Hamilton O. Smith|Hamilton Smith]], had been working on it for decades and was able to provide high-quality DNA libraries.  The genome consists of 1,830,140 base pairs of DNA in a single circular chromosome that contains 1740 protein-coding genes, 2 [[transfer RNA]] genes, and 18 other RNA genes. The sequencing method used was [[whole-genome shotgun]], which was completed and published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1995 and conducted at [[The Institute for Genomic Research]].<ref name=Fleichmann_1995>{{cite journal |author=Fleischmann R, Adams M, White O, Clayton R, Kirkness E, Kerlavage A, Bult C, Tomb J, Dougherty B, Merrick J |title=Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae Rd |journal=Science |volume=269 |issue=5223 |pages=496–512 |year=1995 |pmid=7542800| doi=10.1126/science.7542800 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/269/5223/496 }}</ref>

==Likely protective role of transformation==

Unencapsulated ''H. influenzae'' is often observed in the airways of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Neutrophils are also observed in large numbers in sputum from patients with COPD.  The neutrophils phagocytize ''H. influenzae'', thereby activating an oxidative respiratory burst.<ref name=Naylor>Naylor EJ, Bakstad D, Biffen M, Thong B, Calverley P, Scott S, Hart CA, Moots RJ, Edwards SW (2007). ''Haemophilus influenzae'' induces neutrophil necrosis: a role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?  Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol 37(2):135-143. PMID: 17363778</ref> However instead of killing the bacteria the neutrophils are themselves killed (though such an oxidative burst likely causes DNA damage in the ''H. influenzae'' cells).  The lack of killing of the ''H. influenzae'' appears to explain the persistence of infection in COPD.<ref name=Naylor />  

''H. influenzae'' mutants defective in the ''rec1'' gene (a homolog of [[RecA|''recA'']]) are very sensitive to killing by the oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide.<ref>Sánchez-Rincón DA, Cabrera-Juárez E (1991). Lethal and mutagenic action of hydrogen peroxide on Haemophilus influenzae. J Bacteriol 173(20):6632-6634. PMID: 1917884</ref>  This finding suggests that ''rec1'' expression is important for ''H. influenzae'' survival under conditions of oxidative stress.  Since it is a homolog of ''recA'', ''rec1'' likely plays a key role in recombinational repair of DNA damage.  Thus ''H. influenzae'' may protect its genome against the reactive oxygen species produced by the host’s phagocytic cells through recombinational repair of oxidative DNA damages.<ref>Michod RE, Bernstein H, Nedelcu AM (2008). Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens. Infect Genet Evol 8(3):267-285. PMID: 18295550  http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Faculty/Michod/Downloads/IGE%20review%20sex.pdf</ref>  Recombinational repair of a damaged site of a chromosome requires, in addition to ''rec1'', a second homologous undamaged DNA molecule.  Individual ''H. influenzae'' cells are capable of taking up homologous DNA from other cells by the process of [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]].  Transformation in ''H. influenzae'' involves at least 15 gene products,<ref>Fleischmann RD, Adams MD, White O, Clayton RA, Kirkness EF, Kerlavage AR, Bult CJ, Tomb JF, Dougherty BA, Merrick JM, et al. (1995). Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae Rd. Science 269(5223):496-512. PMID: 7542800</ref> and is likely an adaptation for repairing DNA damages in the resident chromosome (as suggested in [[Transformation (genetics)#Transformation, as an adaptation for DNA repair]]).
