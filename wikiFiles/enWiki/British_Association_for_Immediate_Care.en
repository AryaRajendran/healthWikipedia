The '''British Association for Immediate Care''' ('''BASICS''') is a registered [[Charitable organization|charity]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?remchar=&chyno=276054|title=British Association for Immediate Care Entry|publisher=UK Charity Commission|accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref> which aims to encourage and aid the formation and extension of Immediate Care Schemes and strengthen and develop co-operation between schemes providing Immediate Care and the statutory emergency services. The organisation relies on volunteer [[Health care provider|medical professionals]] and Allied Health Professionals to provide immediate healthcare assistance in support of the emergency services.<ref name=BASICS>{{cite web|url=http://www.basics.org.uk/intropage.htm|title=Introduction to BASICS|accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=On the Scene|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/579736.stm|date=1999-12-27|accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref> It is based in [[Ipswich]].

==Purpose==
BASICS is an association of [[Health care provider|health care professionals]], who undertake additional training as immediate care practitioners.  The members provide their services in support of the statutory or voluntary [[ambulance]] services.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  

BASICS aims to be:<ref name=BASICS/>
# '''A professional body''' to represent members interests
# '''An operational body''' to facilitate the individual schemes
# '''A training body''' to further knowledge amongst its members
# '''An advisory body''' for its members and other stakeholders

BASICS provide a member of the [[JRCALC]] members section to aid in the development of clinical guidelines for UK paramedics and EMTs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

BASICS members are used to provide extra skills at the scene of major incidents, or for particularly difficult patients.  For this, individuals may be summoned on a case by case basis by the local ambulance control centre.  Further support for the work of BASICS during major incidents came following the July 7th terrorist attacks on London, when the [[British Medical Association]] started a series of training courses (over 3 years) to be organised by BASICS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bma.org.uk/pressrel.nsf/wlu/STRE-6Q4JWQ?OpenDocument&vw=wfmms|title=BMA supports emergency medicine training as tribute to 7 July bomb victims|date=2006-05-25|accessdate=2007-06-15}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

They also work at private events, often alongside the voluntary ambulance services ([[British Red Cross|Red Cross]] and [[St John Ambulance]]) or the statutory service{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.  This means that BASICS members can be found at events such as:
* large sporting events (including [[The Football Association|Football Association]] matches)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/SportsMedical-ExerciseScience/FALearningCourses/Postings/2003/11/12225.htm?WBCMODE=PresentationUnpublished%3Fpagedefault.htm|title=Refresher and skills update for crowd doctors|publisher=The Football Association|date=2002-05-30|accessdate=2007-06-16}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
* major incidents
* public rallies
* road traffic collisions
* mass gathering events
* concerts

==Local applications==
BASICS assist the [[Emergency medical services in the United Kingdom|ambulance service trusts]] where a multi-agency response is required at a local level, or additional skills and qualification levels are required.
An example of this multi-agency response would be seen at an 'industrial accident' where for example a worker has become trapped in machinery. The ambulance service would work alongside the fire service to co-ordinate the rescue.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  BASICS can supplement the skill set available at scene with a [[physician|medical doctor]], who can provide skills outside the remit of paramedics, such as different methods of providing [[analgesia]] and, if necessary, surgical procedures which might be needed to extricate the patient.

==Staffing==

===Doctors===
BASICS started up as a small number of [[General Practitioner]]s who were concerned about the immediate care that car crash victims were receiving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basics-scotland.org.uk/about.php|title=BASICS Scotland:About us|accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref> Their goal was to bring increased clinical expertise to the scene on a voluntary basis. Now BASICS Doctors come from a wide range of specialities, including:
* General Practice
* Surgery
* Medicine
* Emergency Medicine
* Anaesthesia & Critical Care

===Nurses===
Nurses who specialise in pre-hospital care play an important in the delivery of patient care in the prehospital arena.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Some Nurses working in pre-hospital care are able to work at Advanced Nurse Practitioner level with a high degrees of clinical autonomy and decision making, some are also independent prescribers.

===Paramedics===
Being the primary Pre-Hospital medical care provider in the UK, Paramedics are a valued part of BASICS schemes. Many have undertaken additional training and education to become Critical Care Paramedics with an extended range of pharmacology and potentially life saving interventions to complement those of their colleagues.

===Combat Medical Technicians===

Combat Medical Technicians are also welcome members of BASICS and bring a high degree of knowledge and experience to BASICS.
