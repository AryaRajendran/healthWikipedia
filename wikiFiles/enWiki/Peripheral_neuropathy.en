'''Peripheral neuropathy''' is damage to [[nerve]]s of the [[peripheral nervous system]], which may be caused either by diseases of or trauma to the [[nerve]] or the [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] of systemic illness.<ref name="urlPeripheral Neuropathy Fact Sheet: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)">{{cite web |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/peripheralneuropathy/detail_peripheralneuropathy.htm |title=Peripheral Neuropathy Fact Sheet: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) |work= |accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref>
<!-- Peripheral neuropathies vary in their presentation and origin, and may affect the ''[[nerve]]'' or the ''[[neuromuscular junction]]''. -->

The four cardinal patterns of peripheral neuropathy are [[polyneuropathy]], [[mononeuropathy]], [[mononeuritis multiplex]] and [[autonomic neuropathy]]. The most common form is (symmetrical) peripheral polyneuropathy, which mainly affects the [[foot|feet]] and [[Human leg|legs]]. The form of neuropathy may be further broken down by cause, or the size of predominant fiber involvement, i.e., large fiber or [[small fiber peripheral neuropathy]]. Frequently the cause of a neuropathy cannot be identified and it is designated as being [[idiopathic]].

Neuropathy may be associated with varying combinations of weakness, autonomic changes, and sensory changes. Loss of muscle bulk or [[fasciculation]]s, a particular fine twitching of muscle, may be seen. Sensory symptoms encompass loss of sensation and "positive" phenomena including [[pain]]. Symptoms depend on the type of nerves affected ([[Motor nerve|motor]], [[Sensory nerve|sensory]], or [[Autonomic nerve|autonomic]]) and where the nerves are located in the body. One or more types of nerves may be affected. Common symptoms associated with damage to the motor nerve are muscle weakness, cramps, and spasms. Loss of balance and coordination may also occur. Damage to the sensory nerve can produce tingling, numbness, and a burning pain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalbug.com/what-is-neuropathy-what-causes-neuropathy/|title=What is neuropathy: What causes neuropathy?|date=8 January 2012|publisher=MedicalBug|accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> Pain associated with this nerve is described in various ways such as the following: burning, freezing, or electric-like, extreme sensitivity to touch. The autonomic nerve damage causes problems with involuntary functions leading to symptoms such as abnormal blood pressure and heart rate, reduced ability to perspire, constipation, bladder dysfunction (e.g., incontinence), and sexual dysfunction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcommunities.com/neuropathy/symptoms.shtml|title=Neuropathy Signs & Symptoms|last=Aggarwat|first=Sandeep K.|date=31 December 1999|publisher=HealthCommunities|accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref>

==Classification==
Peripheral neuropathy may be classified according to the number of nerves affected or the type of nerve cell affected (motor, sensory, autonomic), or the process affecting the nerves (e.g., inflammation in neuritis).

===Mononeuropathy===
{{See also|Compression neuropathy|Ulnar neuropathy}}

'''Mononeuropathy''' is a type of [[neuropathy]] that only affects a single [[nerve]].<ref name="urlDorlands Medical Dictionary:mononeuropathy">{{cite web |url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/five/000067367.htm |title=Dorlands Medical Dictionary:mononeuropathy |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> It is diagnostically useful to distinguish them from polyneuropathies, because the limitation in scope makes it more likely that the cause is a localized trauma or infection.

The most common cause of [[mononeuropathy]] is by physical compression of the nerve, known as [[compression neuropathy]]. [[Carpal tunnel syndrome]] and [[axillary nerve palsy]] are examples of this. The "pins-and-needles" sensation of one's "foot falling asleep" ([[paresthesia]]) is caused by a compression mononeuropathy,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} albeit a temporary one which can be resolved merely by moving around and adjusting to a more appropriate position. Direct injury to a nerve, interruption of its blood supply ([[ischemia]]), or [[inflammation]] can also cause mononeuropathy.

===Mononeuritis multiplex===
'''Mononeuritis multiplex''' is simultaneous or sequential involvement of individual noncontiguous nerve trunks, either partially or completely, evolving over days to years and typically presenting with acute or subacute loss of sensory and motor function of individual [[nerves]]. The pattern of involvement is asymmetric; however, as the disease progresses deficit(s) becomes more confluent and symmetrical, making it difficult to differentiate from polyneuropathy. Therefore, attention to the pattern of early symptoms is important.

Mononeuritis multiplex may also cause pain, which is characterized as deep, aching pain that is worse at night, is frequently in the lower back, hip, or leg.  In people with [[diabetes mellitus]], mononeuritis multiplex is typically encountered as acute, unilateral, severe thigh pain followed by anterior muscle weakness and loss of knee reflex.

Electrodiagnostic studies will show multifocal sensory motor [[axon]]al neuropathy.

It is caused by, or associated with, several medical conditions:
* [[diabetes mellitus]]
* [[vasculitis|vasculitides]]: [[polyarteritis nodosa]], [[Wegener's granulomatosis]], and  [[Churg–Strauss syndrome]]
* immune-mediated diseases like [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[lupus erythematosus]] (SLE), and [[sarcoidosis]]
* infections:  [[leprosy]], [[lyme disease]], [[HIV]]
* [[amyloidosis]]
* [[cryoglobulinemia]]
* chemical agents, including [[trichloroethylene]] and [[dapsone]]
* rarely, the sting of certain [[jellyfish]], such as the [[sea nettle]]

===Polyneuropathy===
{{Main|Polyneuropathy}}

'''Polyneuropathy''' is a pattern of nerve damage which is quite different from mononeuropathy, and often more serious and affecting more areas of the body. The term "peripheral neuropathy" is sometimes used loosely to refer to polyneuropathy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whatisneuropathy.org/|title=What is neuropathy and how will it affect my body?|publisher=What is neuropathy|accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref> In cases of polyneuropathy, many nerve cells in various parts of the body are affected, without regard to the [[nerve]] through which they pass; not all nerve cells are affected in any particular case. In [[distal axonopathy]], one common pattern is that the cell bodies of neurons remain intact, but the [[axon]]s are affected in proportion to their length. [[Diabetic neuropathy]] is the most common cause of this pattern. In demyelinating polyneuropathies, the [[myelin]] sheath around axons is damaged, which affects the ability of the axons to conduct electrical impulses. The third and least common pattern affects the [[cell bodies]] of neurones directly. This usually picks out either the [[motor neurone]]s (known as [[motor neurone disease]]) or the [[sensory neurone]]s (known as ''sensory neuronopathy'' or ''dorsal root ganglionopathy'').

The effect of this is to cause symptoms in more than one part of the body, often on left and right sides symmetrically. As for any neuropathy, the chief symptoms include weakness or clumsiness of movement (motor); unusual or unpleasant sensations such as tingling or burning; reduction in the ability to feel texture, temperature, etc.; and impaired balance when standing or walking (sensory). In many polyneuropathies, these symptoms occur first and most severely in the feet. Autonomic symptoms may also occur, such as dizziness on standing up, [[erectile dysfunction]] and difficulty controlling urination.

Polyneuropathies are usually caused by processes that affect the body as a whole. [[Diabetes]] and [[impaired glucose tolerance]] are the most common causes. Other causes relate to the particular type of polyneuropathy, and there are many different causes of each type, including inflammatory diseases such as lyme disease, vitamin deficiencies, blood disorders, and toxins (including alcohol and certain prescribed drugs). Most types of polyneuropathy progress fairly slowly, over months or years, but rapidly progressive polyneuropathy also occurs. It is important to recognize that glucose levels in the blood can spike to nerve-damaging levels after eating even though fasting blood sugar levels and average blood glucose levels can still remain below normal levels (currently typically considered below 100 for fasting blood plasma and 6.0 for [[Glycated hemoglobin|HGBA1c]], the test commonly used to measure average blood glucose levels over an extended period).  Studies have shown that many of the cases of peripheral small fiber neuropathy with typical symptoms of tingling, pain and loss of sensation in the feet and hands are due to glucose intolerance before a diagnosis of diabetes or pre-diabetes.  Such damage is often reversible, particularly in the early stages, with diet, exercise and weight loss.

The treatment of polyneuropathies is aimed firstly at eliminating or controlling the cause, secondly at maintaining muscle strength and physical function, and thirdly at controlling symptoms such as [[neuropathic pain]].

===Autonomic neuropathy===
'''Autonomic neuropathy'''  is a form of polyneuropathy which affects the non-voluntary, non-sensory [[nervous system]] (i.e., the [[autonomic nervous system]]) affecting mostly the internal organs such as the [[urinary bladder|bladder]] muscles, the [[cardiovascular system]], the [[digestive tract]], and the [[genital]] organs. These nerves are not under a person's conscious control and function automatically. Autonomic nerve fibers form large collections in the thorax, abdomen and pelvis outside [[spinal cord]], however they have connections with the spinal cord and ultimately the brain.  Most commonly autonomic neuropathy is seen in persons with long-standing [[diabetes mellitus]] type 1 and 2. In most but not all cases, autonomic neuropathy occurs alongside other forms of neuropathy, such as sensory neuropathy.

Autonomic neuropathy is one cause of malfunction of the autonomic nervous system, but not the only one; some conditions affecting the brain or spinal cord can also cause [[autonomic dysfunction]], such as [[multiple system atrophy]], and therefore cause similar symptoms to autonomic neuropathy.

The signs and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy include the following:
* [[Urinary bladder]] conditions:  [[bladder incontinence]] or [[urine retention]]
* [[Gastrointestinal tract]]: [[dysphagia]], [[abdominal pain]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[malabsorption]], [[fecal incontinence]], [[gastroparesis]], [[diarrhoea]], [[constipation]]
* [[Cardiovascular system]]:  disturbances of heart rate ([[tachycardia]], [[bradycardia]]), [[orthostatic hypotension]], inadequate increase of heart rate on exertion
* Other areas:  [[hypoglycemia]] unawareness, [[genital]] impotence, sweat disturbances

===Neuritis===
'''Neuritis''' is a general term for inflammation of a [[nerve]]<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000071661|neuritis}}</ref> or the general [[inflammation]] of the [[peripheral nervous system]]. Symptoms depend on the nerves involved, but may include [[pain]], [[paresthesia]] (pins & needles), [[paresis]] (weakness),  [[hypoesthesia]] (numbness), [[anesthesia]], [[paralysis]], wasting, and disappearance of the [[reflexes]]. Causes include:
* [[Physical injury]]
:One common cause of neuritis and subsequent inflammation of the nerves to the toes is the wearing of [[high-heeled shoes]] or ill-fitting shoes that bind the toes painfully. This can cause temporary numbness and pain in the affected toes for several days.
* [[Infection]]
** [[Herpes simplex]]
** [[Shingles]]
** [[Leprosy]]
** [[Lyme Disease]]
* [[Chemical|Chemical injury]]
* [[Radiation]]
* Underlying conditions causing localized neuritis (affecting a single nerve):
** [[Diphtheria]]
** Localized injury
** [[Diabetes]]

* Underlying conditions causing polyneuritis (affecting multiple nerves):
** [[Beriberi]] ([[vitamin B1]] deficiency)
** [[Vitamin B12|Vitamin B12 deficiency]]
** [[Vitamin B6]] excess<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/819426-overview</ref>
** Metabolic diseases
** Diabetes
** [[Herpes zoster]]
** [[Hypothyroidism]]
** [[Porphyria]]
** Infections, [[bacterial]] and/or [[virus|viral]]
** [[Autoimmune]] disease, especially [[Multiple Sclerosis]] and [[Guillain-Barre syndrome]]
** [[Cancer]]
** [[Alcoholism]]
** [[Wartenberg's migratory sensory neuropathy]]

Types of neuritis include:
* [[Polyneuritis]] or multiple neuritis (not to be confused with [[multiple sclerosis]])
* [[Brachial]] neuritis
* [[Optic neuritis]]
* [[Vestibular neuritis]]
* [[Cranial nerves|Cranial neuritis]], often representing as [[Bell's Palsy]]
* Arsenic neuritis

== Signs and symptoms ==
{{unsourced section|date=January 2013}}
Those with diseases or dysfunctions of their nerves can present with problems in any of the normal nerve functions.

In terms of sensory function, there are commonly ''loss of function'' (''negative'') symptoms, which include [[wikt:numb|numbness]], [[tremor]], and [[gait abnormality]].

Gain of function (positive) symptoms include [[Paresthesia|tingling]], [[pain]], [[itch]]ing, crawling, and [[paresthesia|pins and needles]]. Pain can become intense enough to require use of opioid (narcotic) drugs (i.e., morphine, oxycodone).

Motor symptoms include loss of function (negative) symptoms of weakness, [[fatigue (physical)|tiredness]], heaviness, and [[gait abnormality|gait abnormalities]]; and ''gain of function'' (''positive'') symptoms of [[cramps]], tremor, and muscle twitch ([[fasciculation]]s).

There is also [[pain]] in the muscles ([[myalgia]]), cramps, etc., and there may also be [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] dysfunction.

During [[physical examination]], specifically a [[neurological examination]], those with generalized peripheral neuropathies most commonly have distal sensory or motor and sensory loss, though those with a [[pathology]] (problem) of the nerves may be perfectly normal; may show proximal weakness, as in some inflammatory neuropathies like [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]]; or may show focal sensory disturbance or weakness, such as in mononeuropathies. [[Ankle jerk reflex]] is classically absent in peripheral neuropathy.

Many of the diseases of the peripheral nervous system may present similarly to muscle problems ([[myopathy|myopathies]]), and so it is important to develop approaches for assessing sensory and motor disturbances in [[patient]]s so that a [[physician]] may make an accurate diagnosis.

==Treatment==
Many treatment strategies for peripheral neuropathy are symptomatic. Some current research in animal models has shown that [[neurotrophin-3]] can oppose the [[demyelination]] present in some peripheral neuropathies.<ref name="pmid17628499">{{cite journal |author=Liu N, Varma S, Tsao D, Shooter EM, Tolwani RJ |title=Depleting endogenous neurotrophin-3 enhances myelin formation in the Trembler-J mouse, a model of a peripheral neuropathy |journal=J. Neurosci. Res. |volume=85 |issue=13 |pages=2863–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17628499 |doi=10.1002/jnr.21388}}</ref>

A range of drugs that act on the central nervous system such as drugs originally intended as antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs have been found to be useful in managing neuropathic pain. Commonly used treatments include using a [[tricyclic antidepressant]] (such as [[amitriptyline]]) and antiepileptic therapies such as [[gabapentin]] or [[sodium valproate]]. These have the advantage that besides being effective in many cases they are relatively low cost.

A great deal of research has been done between 2005 and 2010 which indicates that synthetic cannabinoids and inhaled cannabis are effective treatments for a range of neuropathic disorders.<ref>http://www.cannabis-med.org/data/pdf/en_2010_01_special.pdf</ref> Research has demonstrated that the synthetic oral cannabinoid Nabilone is an effective adjunct treatment option for neuropathic conditions, especially for people who are resistant, intolerant, or allergic to common medications.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Skrabek RQ, Galimova L, Ethans K, Perry D |title=Nabilone for the treatment of pain in fibromyalgia|journal=J.

[[Pregabalin]] is an anticonvulsant drug used for neuropathic pain. It has also been found effective for generalized anxiety disorder. It was designed as a more potent successor to gabapentin but is significantly more expensive, especially now that the patent on gabapentin has expired and gabapentin is available as a [[generic drug]]. Pregabalin is marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Lyrica.

[[Duloxetine]], a [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]], is also being used to reduce neuropathic pain.

[[Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]] therapy may be effective and safe in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. A recent review of three trials involving 78 patients found some improvement in pain scores after 4 and 6 but not 12 weeks of treatment, and an overall improvement in neuropathic symptoms at 12 weeks.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jin DM, Xu Y, Geng DF, Yan TB |title=Effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on symptomatic diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=Diabetes Res.

reTouch, a medical device designed to reduce symptoms for those suffering from peripheral neuropathy has achieved some initial success. Unlike other treatments such as [[transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]], reTouch is not designed to reduce pain or encourage neurogenesis, but to increase quality of life for patients by improving balance, coordination, and restoring the ability to drive through electronic sensors and vibration motors. reTouch received its first media coverage through the crowd source funding website, [[Indiegogo]].<ref>http://www.indiegogo.com/retouch reTouch,  September 2012</ref>
