'''Biomedical research''' (or '''experimental medicine'''), in general simply known as '''medical research''', is the [[basic research]], [[applied research]], or [[translational research]] conducted to aid and support the body of knowledge in the field of [[medicine]]. Medical research can be divided into two general categories: the evaluation of new treatments for both safety and efficacy in what are termed [[clinical trial]]s, and all other research that contributes to the development of new treatments. The latter is termed [[Pre-clinical development|preclinical research]] if its goal is specifically to elaborate knowledge for the development of new therapeutic strategies. A new paradigm to biomedical research is being termed [[translational research]], which focuses on iterative feedback loops between the basic and clinical research domains to accelerate knowledge translation from the bedside to the bench, and back again. Medical research may involve doing research on public health, biochemistry, clinical research, microbiology, physiology, oncology, surgery and research on many other [[non-communicable disease]]s such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. 

The increased longevity of humans over the past century can be significantly attributed to advances resulting from medical research. Among the major benefits have been [[vaccine]]s for [[measles]] and [[polio]], [[insulin]] treatment for [[diabetes]], classes of [[antibiotic]]s for treating a host of maladies, medication for high [[blood pressure]], improved treatments for [[AIDS]], [[statin]]s and other treatments for [[atherosclerosis]], new surgical techniques such as [[microsurgery]], and increasingly successful treatments for [[cancer]]. New, beneficial tests and treatments are expected as a result of the [[Human Genome Project]]. Many challenges remain, however, including the appearance of [[antibiotic resistance]] and the [[obesity epidemic]].

Most of the research in the field is pursued by [[biomedical scientist]]s, however significant contributions are made by other [[biologist]]s, as well as [[chemist]]s and [[physicist]]s. Medical research, [[human experimentation|done on humans]], has to strictly follow the [[medical ethics]] as sanctioned in the [[Declaration of Helsinki]] and elsewhere. In all cases, the [[research ethics]] has to be respected.

==Preclinical research==
Preclinical research is research in [[basic science]], which precedes the clinical trials, and is almost purely based on theory and [[animal experiments]]. Much of these experiments involve [[preclinical imaging]] modalities to aid ''in vivo'', longitudinal studies.

New treatments come about as a result of other, earlier discoveries — often unconnected to each other, and in various fields. Sometimes the research is done for non-medical purposes, and only by accident contributes to the field of medicine (for example, the discovery of [[penicillin]]). Clinicians use these discoveries to create a treatment regimen, which is then tested in clinical trials.

==Clinical  trials==
{{main|Clinical trial}}

A clinical trial is a comparison test of a [[medication]] or other medical treatment, versus a [[placebo]], other medications and devices, or the standard medical treatment for a patient's condition. Clinical trials vary greatly in size: from a single researcher in one hospital or clinic to an international [[multicenter trial]] with several hundred participating researchers on several continents. The number of patients tested can range from as few as a dozen to several thousands.

=={{anchor|Funding}} Funding==
{{main|Research funding}}
[[Image:Wellcome.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The headquarters of the [[Wellcome Trust]] in London, United Kingdom]]
[[Research funding]] in many countries comes from research bodies which distribute money for equipment and salaries. In the [[United Kingdom]], funding bodies such as the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] derive their assets from UK tax payers, and distribute this to institutions in a competitive manner. The [[Wellcome Trust]] is the UK's largest non-governmental source of funds for biomedical research and provides over £600 million per year in grants to scientists and funds for research centres.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/jan/09/henry-wellcome-collection-medicine-man|title=Henry Wellcome: from backwoods boy to medicine man|accessdate=12 June 2011|publisher=The Guardian|date=9 January 2011}}</ref>

In the United States, the most recent data from 2003<ref name="Moses05">{{cite journal | author = Moses H, Dorsey E, Matheson D, Thier S | title = Financial anatomy of biomedical research. | journal = JAMA | volume = 294 | issue = 11 | pages = 1333–42 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16174691 | doi = 10.1001/jama.294.11.1333}}</ref> suggest that about 94 billion dollars were provided for biomedical research in the United States. The [[National Institutes of Health]] and [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] collectively contribute 26.4 billion dollars and 27.0 billion dollars, respectively, which constitute 28% and 29% of the total, respectively. Other significant contributors include [[biotechnology]] companies (17.9 billion dollars, 19% of total), [[medical devices|medical device]] companies (9.2 billion dollars, 10% of total), other federal sources, and state and local governments. Foundations and charities, led by the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], contributed about 3% of the funding.

In Australia, in 2000/01 (the most recent data available), about $1.7B was spent on biomedical research,<ref>Investment Review of Health and Medical Research (Grant Review) (2004). Sustaining the Virtuous Cycle For a Healthy, Competitive Australia. Department of Health and Ageing.
	
</ref> with just under half ($800M, 47%) sourced from the Commonwealth government (all sources).  About $540M came from business investments/funding and a further $220M from private or not-for-profit organisations (totalling 44%).  The balance was from state and local governments.  Since then there has been a significant in government funding through the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] (NHMRC), whose expenditure on research was nearly A$700 million in 2008-09.<ref>{{Citation

The enactment of [[orphan drug]] legislation in some countries has increased funding available to develop drugs meant to treat rare conditions, resulting in breakthroughs that previously were uneconomical to pursue.

==Regulations and guidelines==
Medical research is highly regulated. National regulatory authorities oversee and monitor medical research, such as for the development of new drugs. In the [[United States|USA]] the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] oversees new drug development, in Europe the [[European Medicines Agency]] (see also [[EudraLex]]), and in [[Japan]] the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)]]. The [[World Medical Association]] develops the ethical standards for the medical profession, involved in medical research. The most fundamental of them is the [[Declaration of Helsinki]]. The [[International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use]] (ICH) works on the creation of rules and guidelines for the development of new medication, such as the guidelines for [[Good clinical practice|Good Clinical Practice]] (GCP). All ideas of regulation are based on a country's ethical standards code. This is why treatment of a particular disease in one country may not be allowed, but is in another.
