The '''''Textbook of Military Medicine''''' (TMM) is a series of volumes on [[military medicine]] published since 1989 by the [[Borden Institute]], of the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|Office of The Surgeon General]], of the [[United States Army|United States Department of the Army]].  It constitutes a comprehensive, multi-volume treatise on the art and science of military medicine, as practiced by the [[United States]] armed forces. The books integrate lessons learned in past wars with current principles and practices of military medical doctrine.

The spectrum of topics is broad, ranging from [[wound ballistics]] to [[medical ethics]], and from considerations of harsh environments to applied biomedicine. The TMM series is intended to be tri-service in scope, although the majority of contributors are affiliated with the U.S. Army.
