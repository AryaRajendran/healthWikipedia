AFP is a major [[plasma protein]] produced by the yolk sac and the liver during fetal development that is thought to be the fetal form of [[serum albumin]].  AFP binds to copper, nickel, [[fatty acid]]s and [[bilirubin]]<ref name="entrez"/>  and is found in monomeric, dimeric and trimeric forms.

== Structure ==

AFP is a [[glycoprotein]] of 591 amino acids<ref name="pmid1709810">{{cite journal | author = Pucci P, Siciliano R, Malorni A, Marino G, Tecce MF, Ceccarini C, Terrana B | title = Human alpha-fetoprotein primary structure: a mass spectrometric study | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 30 | issue = 20 | pages = 5061–6 | year = 1991 | month = May | pmid = 1709810 | doi = 10.1021/bi00234a032| url = }}</ref> and a carbohydrate moiety.<ref name="pmid7544570">{{cite journal | author = Seregni E, Botti C, Bombardieri E | title = Biochemical characteristics and clinical applications of alpha-fetoprotein isoforms | journal = Anticancer Res. | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 1491–9 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7544570 | doi =  }}</ref>
== Function ==

AFP is the most abundant plasma protein found in the human fetus. Plasma levels decrease rapidly after birth but begin decreasing prenatally starting at the end of the first trimester. Normal adult levels are usually achieved by the age of 8 to 12 months.  The function of AFP in adults is unknown; however, in rodent fetuses it binds [[estradiol]] to prevent the transport of this hormone across the [[placenta]].  The main function of this is to prevent the [[virilization|masculinization]] of female fetuses. As human AFP does not bind estrogen, its function in human fetuses is less clear.<ref name="isbn0-262-52321-3">{{cite book | editor = Becker JB  | title = Behavioral Endocrinology | chapter = Neuroendocrinology of sexual behavior in the female | author = Carter CS | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Mass | year = 2002  | pages = 88–89  | isbn = 0-262-52321-3 | url = http://books.google.se/books?id=D6TnKbTRBJoC&lpg=PA88&ots=jgmtzhDR8p&dq=AFP%20binds%20maternal%20estrogen&pg=PA88#v=onepage&q=AFP%20binds%20maternal%20estrogen&f=false }}</ref>

The rodent AFP system can be overridden with massive injections of estrogen, which swamp the AFP system and will masculinize the fetus.  The masculinizing effect of estrogens may seem counter-intuitive since estrogens are critical for the proper development of female secondary characteristics during puberty. However, this is not the case prenatally. Gonadal hormones from the testes, such as [[testosterone]] and [[antimullerian hormone]] are required to cause development of a phenotypic male. Without these hormones the fetus will develop into a phenotypic female even if genetically [[XY sex-determination system|XY]]. Interestingly, the conversion of testosterone into estradiol by [[aromatase]] in many tissues may be an important step in masculinization of that tissue.<ref name="pmid11124800">{{cite journal | author = Nef S, Parada LF | title = Hormones in male sexual development | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 14 | issue = 24 | pages = 3075–86 | year = 2000 | month = December | pmid = 11124800 | doi = 10.1101/gad.843800 }}</ref><ref name="pmid1734525">{{cite journal| author=Elbrecht A, Smith RG| title=Aromatase enzyme activity and sex determination in chickens. | journal=Science | year= 1992 | volume= 255 | issue= 5043 | pages= 467–70 | pmid=1734525 | doi=  10.1126/science.1734525}} </ref> Masculinization of the brain is thought to occur both by conversion of testosterone into estradiol by aromatase, but also by [[de novo synthesis]] of estrogens within the brain.<ref name="pmid17720235">{{cite journal| author=Bakker J, Baum MJ | title=Role for estradiol in female-typical brain and behavioral sexual differentiation. | journal=Front Neuroendocrinol | year= 2008 | volume= 29 | issue= 1 | pages= 1–16 | pmid=17720235 | doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2007.06.001 | pmc= 2373265 }}</ref><ref name="pmid15313793">{{cite journal| author=Harding CF| title=Hormonal modulation of singing: hormonal modulation of the songbird brain and singing behavior. | journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci | year= 2004 | volume= 1016 | issue=  | pages= 524–39 | pmid=15313793 | doi=10.1196/annals.1298.030 }} </ref> Thus, AFP may protect the fetus from maternal estradiol that would otherwise have a masculinizing effect on the fetus, but its exact role is still controversial.

== Serum levels ==
{{main|Elevated alpha-fetoprotein}}

=== Maternal ===

In pregnant women, fetal AFP levels can be monitored in urine. AFP is cleared strongly from the kidneys allowing AFP to tend to mirror fetal serum levels. In contrast, maternal serum AFP levels are much lower but continue to rise until about week 32. This is thought to be because the mother is not utilising the AFP, and therefore clears it from her system without issue.

=== Infants ===

The normal range of AFP for adults and children is variously reported as under 50, under 10, and under 5&nbsp;ng/mL.<ref name="pmid1375809">{{cite journal | author = Ball D, Rose E, Alpert E | title = Alpha-fetoprotein levels in normal adults | journal = Am.

During this time, the normal range of AFP levels spans approximately 2 orders of magnitude.<ref name="pmid2471821"/>  Correct evaluation of ''abnormal'' AFP levels in infants must take into account these normal patterns.<ref name="pmid2471821">{{cite journal | author = Lee PI, Chang MH, Chen DS, Lee CY | title = Serum alpha-fetoprotein levels in normal infants: a reappraisal of regression analysis and sex difference | journal = J.

Very high AFP levels may be subject to '''hooking''' (see [[Tumor marker]]), which results in the level being reported significantly lower than the actual concentration.<ref name="pmid16824284">{{cite journal | author = Jassam N, Jones CM, Briscoe T, Horner JH | title = The hook effect: a need for constant vigilance | journal = Ann.

AFP can also be used as a biomarker to detect a subset of tumors in non-pregnant women, men, and children. A level above 500 nanograms/milliliter of AFP in adults can be indicative of [[hepatocellular carcinoma]], [[germ cell tumor]]s, and [[metastatic cancer]]s of the liver.
