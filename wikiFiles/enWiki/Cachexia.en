'''Cachexia''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|k|ə|ˈ|k|ɛ|k|s|i|ə}}; from [[Greek language|Greek]] κακός ''kakos'' "bad" and ἕξις ''hexis'' "condition")<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Cachexia ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'' definition of cachexia]</ref> or '''[[wasting|wasting syndrome]]''' is [[weight loss|loss of weight]], [[muscle atrophy]], fatigue, weakness, and significant [[anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]] in someone who is not actively trying to lose weight. The formal definition of cachexia is the loss of body mass that cannot be reversed nutritionally:  Even if the affected patient eats more calories, [[lean body mass]] will be lost, indicating a primary pathology is in place. 

Cachexia is seen in patients with [[cancer]], [[AIDS]],<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages=1169 |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 }}</ref> [[chronic obstructive lung disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[congestive heart failure]], [[tuberculosis]], [[Familial amyloid neuropathy|familial amyloid polyneuropathy]], [[mercury poisoning]] (acrodynia) and hormonal deficiency.

It is a positive risk factor for death, meaning if the patient has cachexia, the chance of death from the underlying condition is increased dramatically.  It can be a [[sign (medicine)|sign]] of various underlying disorders; when a patient presents with cachexia, a doctor will generally consider the possibility of [[cancer]], [[metabolic acidosis]] (from decreased protein synthesis and increased protein [[catabolism]]), certain [[infectious disease]]s (e.g., tuberculosis, AIDS), chronic pancreatitis, and some [[autoimmune disorder]]s, or addiction to [[amphetamine]]. Cachexia physically weakens patients to a state of immobility stemming from loss of appetite, [[asthenia]], and [[anemia]], and response to standard treatment is usually poor.<ref name="pmid18685379">{{cite journal | author = Lainscak M, Podbregar M, Anker SD | title = How does cachexia influence survival in cancer, heart failure and other chronic diseases? | journal = Curr Opin Support Palliat Care | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 299–305 | year = 2007 | month = December | pmid = 18685379 | doi = 10.1097/SPC.0b013e3282f31667 | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid17685872">{{cite journal | author = Bossola M, Pacelli F, Doglietto GB | title = Novel treatments for cancer cachexia | journal = Expert Opin Investig Drugs | volume = 16 | issue = 8 | pages = 1241–53 | year = 2007 | month = August | pmid = 17685872 | doi = 10.1517/13543784.16.8.1241 | url = http://www.expertopin.com/doi/abs/10.1517/13543784.16.8.1241}}</ref>

==Disease settings==
Cachexia is often seen in end-stage [[cancer]], and in that context is called "cancer cachexia".

Patients with [[congestive heart failure]] can have a cachectic syndrome. Also, a cachexia comorbidity is seen in patients who have any of the range of illnesses classified as [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], particularly emphysema. 

In each of these settings, full-body [[wasting]] occurs, which affects especially the [[skeletal muscle]], resulting in [[muscle atrophy]]. However, when presenting comorbidly with malabsorption syndrome, (as seen, for example, in Crohn's disease or celiac disease), simply consuming more food is not sufficient to reverse wasting and the malabsorption must be treated before the patient will be able to stabilize body mass.<ref name=Beck>{{cite journal |author=Beck, Ivan T. |last2=Bjertnaes |first2=L |title=Treatment of Malabsorption Syndrome |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=91 |issue=6 |pages=301–302 |year=1964 |month=August |pmid=1927227}}</ref>

==Mechanism==
The exact mechanism in which these diseases cause cachexia is poorly understood, but there is probably a role for [[inflammation|inflammatory]] [[cytokine]]s, such as [[tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] (which is also nicknamed 'cachexin' or 'cachectin'), [[Interferon|interferon gamma]]<!-- not needed (IFNγ),--> and [[interleukin 6]]<!-- not needed (IL-6)-->, as well as the [[tumor]]-secreted [[proteolysis]]-inducing factor.

Related malnutrition syndromes are [[kwashiorkor]] and [[marasmus]], although these do not always have an underlying causative illness; they are most often symptomatic of severe [[malnutrition]].

Those suffering from the eating disorder anorexia nervosa appear to have high plasma levels of [[ghrelin]]. Ghrelin levels are also high in patients who have cancer-induced cachexia.<ref name="pmid15713718">{{cite journal | author = Garcia J.M., Garcia-Touza M., Hijazi R.A., Taffet G., Epner D., Mann D., Smith R.G., Cunningham G.R., Marcelli M. | title = Active ghrelin levels and active to total ghrelin ratio in cancer-induced cachexia | journal = J.

==Treatment==
Currently, no widely accepted drugs to treat cachexia and no FDA-approved drugs to treat cancer cachexia are available.

Cachexia may be treated by [[steroid]]s, such as [[corticosteroid]]s, or drugs that mimic [[progesterone]], which increase appetite, may reverse weight loss, but have no evidence of reversing muscle loss.<ref name=Gagnon/> [[Medical marijuana]] has been allowed for the treatment of cachexia in some US states, such as Delaware, Nevada, Michigan, Washington, Oregon, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Vermont, New Jersey, and Connecticut.<ref name=Gagnon>{{cite journal |author=Gagnon B, Bruera E |title=A review of the drug treatment of cachexia associated with cancer |journal=Drugs |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=675–88 |year=1998 |month=May |pmid=9585863 |doi=10.2165/00003495-199855050-00005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yavuzsen T., Davis M.P., Walsh D., LeGrand S., Lagman R. |title=Systematic review of the treatment of cancer-associated anorexia and weight loss |journal=J.

===Omega-3 fatty acids===
A 2007 [systematic review] of [[n-3 fatty acid]]s and cachexia found 17 studies, eight of which were high-quality. It concluded there was evidence of oral [[omega-3 fatty acid|n-3 fatty acid]] supplements benefiting cancer patients, improving appetite, weight and [[quality of life]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Colomer R., Moreno-Nogueira J.M., García-Luna PP, ''et al.'' |title=N-3 fatty acids, cancer and cachexia: a systematic review of the literature |journal=Br.

A 2009 trial found a supplement of [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] helped cancer patients retain muscle mass.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ryan A.M., Reynolds J.V., Healy L, ''et al.'' |title=Enteral nutrition enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) preserves lean body mass following esophageal cancer surgery: results of a double-blinded randomized controlled trial |journal=Ann.

===Drugs in development===
Three phase-2 clinical presentations occurred at ASCO 2010, with these results:
[[ALD518]] is a humanized [[anti-IL-6]] antibody.  In testing, 124 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  were randomized to one of four treatment groups (about 30 per group). Researchers concluded the ALD518 given to patients with NSCLC was safe and well tolerated. ALD518 improved the lung symptom score, reversed fatigue, and less loss of [[lean body mass]] occurred (−0.19&nbsp;kg on ALD518 vs. −1.50&nbsp;kg on placebo).<ref>{{cite journal |author=J.R.

[[GTx-024]] is a [[selective androgen receptor modulator]] (SARM). In testing, 159 patients with either NSCLC, colorectal cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia or breast cancer were randomized to oral GTx-024 (3&nbsp;mg or 1&nbsp;mg) or placebo daily for 16 weeks.  As a result, a statistically significant increase in lean body mass (LBM) was observed in both treatment groups compared to baseline (1&nbsp;mg, ''p'' =0.001; 3&nbsp;mg, ''p'' =0.045).<ref>{{cite journal|author=M.S. Steiner et al|title=Effect of GTx-024, a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM), on stair climb performance and quality of life (QOL) in patients with cancer cachexia|journal=J Clin Oncol|volume=28|issue=1534|year=2010|month=June|url=http://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/Meetings/Abstracts?&vmview=abst_detail_view&confID=74&abstractID=52947|unused_data=suppl;abstr 9147))}}</ref>

[[VT-122]] is a coadministration of propranolol and [[etodolac]]. In testing, 37 patients with advanced NSCLC were randomized to one of three treatment groups (about 12 per group). Researchers observed a statistically significant difference in the proportion of subjects who responded with an improvement of ≥ 5% in LBM at week 12 (group A, control, ''n'' = 0/12; group B, low dose VT-122, ''n'' = 7/12 ''p'' = 0.0191; group C, high dose VT-122, ''n'' = 5/12, ''p'' = 0.0174). No patient in group A gained any lean body mass.  An increasing trend in improvement was seen at weeks 6 and 9 for groups B and C.<ref>{{cite journal|author=G.S.

At the fifth annual meeting of the Society on Cachexia and Wasting Disorders in Barcelona December 5–8, 2009, data were presented on various molecules in development.<!-- Kung et al. reported highlights from the 5th Cachexia Conference held in December 2009 in Barcelona, Spain.--><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kung T  et al|title= Novel treatment approaches to cachexia and sarcopenia: highlights from the 5th Cachexia Conference |journal= Expert Opin Investig Drugs |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=579–585 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20367196 |doi =10.1517/13543781003724690}}</ref>  Novel therapeutic approaches shown here include type 4 melanocortin receptor antagonist [[SNT 207979]], an IL-6 antagonist [[ALD518]], the appetite-promoting synthetic ghrelin [[SUN11031]], the soluble myostatin decoy receptor [[ActRIIB-Fc]], the fast skeletal muscle troponin-activating substance [[CK-2017357]], the anticatabolic/anabolic transforming agent [[MT-102]], the anti-inflammatory agent [[celecoxib]], [[testosterone]] supplementation and [[vitamin D]].
Two of the presenting companies were Cytokinetics and Ohr Pharmaceutical. Cytokinetics' molecule {{Clarify|date=October 2011}} acts as a skeletal muscle activator by making certain proteins more sensitive to calcium, as a potential treatment for diseases and conditions associated with aging, muscle wasting or neuromuscular dysfunction. Ohr Pharmaceutical's drug, [[OHR/AVR118]], modulates proinflammatory [[chemokine]] and [[cytokine]] synthesis, including [[TNF-alpha]].<!-- cited above{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}-->

===Other preclinical work===
In a study published in 2010, researchers demonstrated a link between cachexia and [[activin]] and [[myostatin]] activity, and successfully reversed the effects in mice, by inhibiting that activity through treatment with a soluble version of the [[ActRIIB receptor]] ([[sActRIIB]]).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhou, Xiaolan; Wang, Jin Lin; Lu, John; Song, Yanping; Kwak, Keith S.; Jiao, Qingsheng; Rosenfeld, Robert; Chen, Qing; Boone, Thomas; Simonet, W.

==Prevalence==
According to the 2007 AHRQ National Inpatient sample, in a projected 129,164 hospital encounters in the United States, cachexia was listed as at least one of up to 14 listed diagnosis codes, based on a sample of 26,325 unweighted encounters.<ref>http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/nisoverview.jsp</ref> The CDC National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, a sample of US outpatient visits listed no visits where cachexia was listed as one of up to three recorded diagnoses treated during the visit, out of a sample of 32,778 unweighted visits.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ahcd.htm National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey]</ref>

==Cancer cachexia==
About 50% of all cancer patients suffer from cachexia. Those with upper gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancers have the highest frequency of developing a cachexic symptom. This figure rises to 80% in terminal cancer patients.<ref>{{cite journal|author=K.C.H. Fearon et al|title= Cancer cachexia|journal=Int J Cardiol|volume=85|issue=1|year=2002|month=Sep|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527302002358|doi=10.1016/S0167-5273(02)00235-8|pages=73–81|pmid=12163211}}</ref> In addition to increasing morbidity and mortality, aggravating the side effects of chemotherapy, and reducing quality of life, cachexia is considered the immediate cause of death of a large proportion of cancer patients, ranging from 22% to 40% of the patients.<ref>{{cite journal|author= O.

Symptoms of cancer cachexia include progressive weight loss and depletion of host reserves of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Cachexia should be suspected if involuntary weight loss of greater than 5% of premorbid weight occurs within a six-month period. Traditional treatment approaches, such as appetite stimulants, [[5-HT3 antagonist|5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists]], nutrient supplementation, and [[COX-2 inhibitor]], have failed to demonstrate success in reversing the metabolic abnormalities seen in cancer cachexia.<ref name=Kumar/>

===Pathogenesis===
Much research is currently focused on determining the mechanism of the development of cachexia. The two main theories of the development of cancer cachexia are:
*Alteration of control loop: High levels of [[leptin]], a hormone secreted by adipocytes, block the release of neuropeptide (NPY), which is the most potent feeding-stimulatory peptide in the [[hypothalamic]] [[orexigenic]] network, leading to decreased energy intake, but high metabolic demand for nutrients. 
*Cachectic syndrome maintained by tumor-derived factors: Factors, such as lipid mobilizing factor extracted from the urine of cachectic patients, were suspected to induce protein degradation in skeletal muscle by upregulation of the [[ubiquitin-proteasome pathway]] and [[lipolysis]] in adipocytes. However, how they interact and whether they come into play at the beginning or at the end stage of the disease is uncertain .<ref>{{cite journal|author= M.E. Martignoni et al|title= Cancer Cachexia|journal= Mol Cancer|volume=2|issue=1|year=2003|month=Nov| url=http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/2/1/36|doi= 10.1186/1476-4598-2-36|pages= 36 }}</ref> 

Although the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia is poorly understood, multiple biologic pathways are known to be involved, including proinflammatory [[cytokines]] such as [[TNF-alpha]], neuroendocrine hormones, [[IGF-1]], and tumor-specific factors such as proteolysis-inducing factor. 

The inﬂammatory cytokines involved in wasting diseases are [[interleukin 6]], TNF-alpha, [[IL1B]], and [[interferon-gamma]]. Although many different tissues and cell types may be responsible for the increase in circulating cytokines during some types of cancer, evidence indicates the tumors are an important source. Cytokines by themselves are capable of inducing weight loss. TNF-alpha has been shown to have direct catabolic effect on skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and produces muscle atrophy through the ubiquitin–proteasome proteolytic pathway. The mechanism involves the formation of reactive oxygen species leading to upregulation of the transcription factor [[NF-κB]]. NF-κB is a known regulator of the genes that encode cytokines, and cytokine receptors. The increased production of cytokines induces proteolysis and breakdown of [[myofibrillar]] proteins.<ref name=Kumar/>

===Treatments===
Only limited treatment options exist for patients with clinical cancer cachexia. Current strategy is to improve appetite by using appetite stimulants to ensure adequate intake of nutrients. Pharmacological interventions with appetite stimulants, nutrient supplementation, [[5-HT3 antagonist|5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists]] and [[Cox-2 inhibitor]] have been used to treat cancer cachexia, but with limited effect.

Recent studies using a more calorie-dense (1.5 kcals/ml) and higher protein supplementation have suggested at least weight stabilization can be achieved, although improvements in lean body mass have not been observed in these studies.<ref name=Kumar>{{cite journal|author= N.B. Kumar et al|title= Cancer Cachexia: Traditional Therapies and Novel Molecular Mechanism-Based Approaches to Treatment |journal= Curr Treat Options Oncol |volume=11|issue=3|year=2010|month=December|url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/1212v77t37qj6510/?MUD=MP|doi= 10.1007/s11864-010-0127-z|pages= 107 }}</ref>

Therapeutic strategies have been based on either blocking cytokines synthesis or their action. [[Thalidomide]] has been demonstrated to suppress TNF-alpha production in monocytes ''in vitro'' and to normalize elevated TNF-alpha levels ''in vivo''. A recent randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with cancer cachexia showed the drug was well tolerated and effective at attenuating loss of weight and LBM in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. An improvement in the LBM and improved quality of life were also observed in a randomized, double-blind trial using a protein and energy-dense, [[omega-3 fatty acids]]-enriched oral supplement, provided its consumption was equal or superior to 2.2 g of [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] per day. It is also through decreasing TNF-alpha production. However, recent data arising from a large, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial indicate EPA administration alone is not successful in the treatment of weight loss in patients with advanced gastrointestinal or lung cancer.<ref name="Argiles"/> 

Peripheral muscle proteolysis, as it occurs in cancer cachexia, serves to mobilize amino acids required for the synthesis of liver and tumor protein. Therefore, the administration of exogenous amino acids may theoretically serve as a protein-sparing metabolic fuel by providing substrates for both muscle metabolism and [[gluconeogenesis]]. Recent studies have demonstrated dietary supplementation with a specific combination of high protein, leucine and fish oil improves muscle function and daily activity and the immune response in cachectic tumor-bearing mice. In addition, β-hydroxy-β-methyl butirate derived from leucine catabolism used as a supplement in tumor-bearing rats prevents cachexia by modifying NF-κB expression.<ref name="Argiles"/>

A recent phase-2 study involving the administration of [[antioxidants]], pharmaconutritional support, [[progestogen]] ([[megestrol acetate]] and [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]]), and anti[[cyclooxygenase-2]] drugs, showed efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with advanced cancer of different sites suffering cachexia. These data reinforce the use of the multitargeted therapies (nutritional supplementation, appetite stimulants, and physical activity regimen) in the treatment of cancer cachexia.<ref name="Argiles">{{cite journal|author= J.M. Argilés et al|title= Anti-inflammatory therapies in cancer cachexia |journal= Eur J Pharmacol |volume=668|year=2011|month=Sep| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299911007783|doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.07.007|pages= S81–6|pmid= 21835173}}</ref>
