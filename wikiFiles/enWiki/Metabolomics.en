'''Metabolomics''' is the scientific study of chemical processes involving [[metabolite]]s. Specifically, metabolomics is the "systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints that specific cellular processes leave behind", the study of their small-molecule [[metabolite]] profiles.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Bennett |last=Daviss |month=April |year=2005 |title=Growing pains for metabolomics |journal=The Scientist |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=25–28 |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/article/display/15427/}}</ref> The [[metabolome]] represents the collection of all metabolites in a biological cell, tissue, organ or organism, which are the end products of cellular processes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jordan KW, Nordenstam J, Lauwers GY, Rothenberger DA, Alavi K, Garwood M, Cheng LL |title=Metabolomic characterization of human rectal adenocarcinoma with intact tissue magnetic resonance spectroscopy |journal=Diseases of the Colon & Rectum |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=520–5 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19333056 |doi=10.1007/DCR.0b013e31819c9a2c |url= |pmc=2720561}}</ref> Thus, while [[mRNA]] [[gene expression]] data and [[proteomics|proteomic]] analyses do not tell the whole story of what might be happening in a cell, metabolic profiling can give an instantaneous snapshot of the physiology of that cell. One of the challenges of [[systems biology]] and [[functional genomics]] is to integrate [[proteomics|proteomic]], [[transcriptomics|transcriptomic]], and metabolomic information to give a more complete picture of living organisms.

==Origins==

The idea that biological fluids reflect the health of an individual has existed for a long time. [[History_of_medical_diagnosis#Ancient_China|Ancient Chinese doctors]] used ants for the evaluation of urine of patients to detect whether the urine contained high levels of glucose, and hence detect diabetes.<ref name=VDGarticle>Van der greef and Smilde, J Chemomet, (2005) 19:376-386</ref> In the Middle Ages, "urine charts" were used to link the colours, tastes and smells of urine to various medical conditions, which are metabolic in origin.<ref name=JKNnature>{{cite journal |author=Nicholson JK, Lindon JC |title=Systems biology: Metabonomics |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7216 |pages=1054–6 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18948945 |doi=10.1038/4551054a |url=|bibcode = 2008Natur.455.1054N }}</ref>

The concept that individuals might have a "metabolic profile" that could be reflected in the makeup of their biological fluids was introduced by Roger Williams in the late 1940s,<ref>{{cite journal | last=Gates |first=Sweeley | year = 1978 | title =Quantitative metabolic profiling based on gas chromatography |journal = [[Clin Chem]] | volume = 24 | issue = 10| pages = 1663–73 | pmid = 359193 | last2 = Sweeley | first2 = CC }}</ref> who used [[paper chromatography]] to suggest characteristic metabolic patterns in urine and saliva were associated with diseases such as [[schizophrenia]]. However, it was only through technological advancements in the 1960s and 1970s that it became feasible to quantitatively (as opposed to qualitatively) measure metabolic profiles.<ref>Preti, George. "Metabolomics comes of age?" ''[[The Scientist]]'', 19[11]:8, June 6, 2005.</ref> The term "metabolic profile" was introduced by Horning, ''et al.'' in 1971 after they demonstrated that [[gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]] (GC-MS) could be used to measure compounds present in human urine and tissue extracts.<ref name="VDGarticle"/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Novotny  ''et al.'' | year = 2008 | title =  Biochemical individuality reflected in chromatographic, electrophoretic and mass-spectrometric profiles| url = | journal = J Chromatog B | volume = 866 | issue = | pages = 26–47 | doi = 10.1016/j.jchromb.2007.10.007 | last2 = Soini | first2 = Helena A. | last3 = Mechref | first3 = Yehia }}</ref> The Horning group, along with that of [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Arthur B.

Concurrently, [[NMR spectroscopy]], which was discovered in the 1940s, was also undergoing rapid advances. In 1974, Seeley et al. demonstrated the utility of using NMR to detect metabolites in unmodified biological samples.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Hoult DI, Busby SJ, Gadian DG, Radda GK, Richards RE, Seeley PJ |title=Observation of tissue metabolites using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance |journal=Nature |volume=252 |issue=5481 | pages=285–7 |year=1974 |month=November |pmid=4431445 | doi=10.1038/252285a0 | bibcode=1974Natur.252..285H}}</ref> This first study on muscle highlighted the value of NMR in that it was determined that 90% of cellular [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is complexed with magnesium.

In 2005, the first metabolomics web database, [[METLIN]],<ref name="Smith CA, I'Maille G, Want EJ, Qin C, Trauger SA, Brandon TR, Custodio DE, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G 2005 747–51">{{cite journal | author=Smith CA, I'Maille G, Want EJ, Qin C, Trauger SA, Brandon TR, Custodio DE, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G |title=METLIN: a metabolite mass spectral database |journal=Ther Drug Monit |volume=27 |issue=6| pages=747–51 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16404815 |url=http://masspec.scripps.edu/publications/public_pdf/107_art.pdf | doi=10.1097/01.ftd.0000179845.53213.39}}</ref> for characterizing human metabolites was developed in the Siuzdak laboratory at [[The Scripps Research Institute]] and contained over 10,000 metabolites and tandem mass spectral data. {{As of|2012|09}}, METLIN contains over 60,000 metabolites as well as the largest repository of tandem mass spectrometry data in metabolomics.

On 23 January 2007, the [[Human Metabolome Project]], led by Dr. David Wishart of the [[University of Alberta]], Canada, completed the first draft of the human metabolome, consisting of a database of approximately 2500 metabolites, 1200 drugs and 3500 food components.<ref name=Wishart2007>{{cite journal |author=Wishart DS, Tzur D, Knox C, ''et al.'' |title=HMDB: the Human Metabolome Database |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=35 |issue=Database issue |pages=D521–6 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17202168 |pmc=1899095 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkl923}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wishart DS, Knox C, Guo AC, Eisner R, Young N, Gautam B, Hau DD, Psychogios N, Dong E, Bouatra S, Mandal R, Sinelnikov I, Xia J, Jia L, Cruz JA, Lim E, Sobsey CA, Shrivastava S, Huang P, Liu P, Fang L, Peng J, Fradette R, Cheng D, Tzur D, Clements M, Lewis A, De Souza A, Zuniga A, Dawe M, Xiong Y, Clive D, Greiner R, Nazyrova A, Shaykhutdinov R, Li L, Vogel HJ, Forsythe I |title=HMDB: a knowledgebase for the human metabolome |journal=[[Nucleic Acids Research]] |year= 2009 |pmid=18953024 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkn810 |url= |volume=37 |pages=D603–10 |issue=Database issue |pmc=2686599}}</ref> Similar projects have been underway in several plant species, most notably ''[[Medicago truncatula]]'' and ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' for several years.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==Metabolome==
Metabolome refers to the complete set of small-molecule metabolites (such as metabolic intermediates, hormones and other signaling molecules, and secondary metabolites) to be found within a biological sample, such as a single organism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oliver SG, Winson MK, Kell DB, Baganz F |title=Systematic functional analysis of the yeast genome |journal=Trends in Biotechnology |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=373–8 |year=1998 |month=September |pmid=9744112 |doi=10.1016/S0167-7799(98)01214-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Griffin JL, Vidal-Puig A |title=Current challenges in metabolomics for diabetes research: a vital functional genomic tool or just a ploy for gaining funding? |journal=Physiol.

Although the metabolome can be defined readily enough, it is not currently possible to analyse the entire range of metabolites by a single analytical method. The first metabolite database(called [[METLIN]]) for searching m/z values from mass spectrometry data was developed by scientists at [[The Scripps Research Institute]] in 2005.<ref name="Smith CA, I'Maille G, Want EJ, Qin C, Trauger SA, Brandon TR, Custodio DE, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G 2005 747–51"/> In January 2007, scientists at the [[University of Alberta]] and the [[University of Calgary]] completed the first draft of the human metabolome.

==Metabolites==
Metabolites are the intermediates and products of [[metabolism]]. Within the context of metabolomics, a metabolite is usually defined as any molecule less than 1 kDa in size.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Samuelsson LM, Larsson DG |title=Contributions from metabolomics to fish research |journal=Mol Biosyst |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=974–9 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=19082135 |doi=10.1039/b804196b |url=}}</ref> However, there are exceptions to this depending on the sample and detection method. For example, macromolecules such as [[lipoprotein]]s and [[albumin]] are reliably detected in NMR-based metabolomics studies of blood plasma.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nicholson JK, Foxall PJ, Spraul M, Farrant RD, Lindon JC |title=750 MHz 1H and 1H-13C NMR spectroscopy of human blood plasma |journal=Anal.

A primary metabolite is directly involved in the normal growth, development, and reproduction. A [[secondary metabolite]] is not directly involved in those processes, but usually has important [[Ecology|ecological]] function. Examples include [[antibiotics]] and [[pigment]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bentley R |title=Secondary metabolite biosynthesis: the first century |journal=Crit. Rev.

The [[metabolome]] forms a large network of [[metabolic]] reactions, where outputs from one [[enzymatic]] [[chemical reaction]] are inputs to other chemical reactions. Such systems have been described as [[hypercycle (chemistry)|hypercycle]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Metabonomics== <!-- This section is linked from redirect "[[Metabonomics]]" -->
Metabonomics is defined as "the quantitative measurement of the dynamic multiparametric metabolic response of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification". The word origin is from the Greek ''μεταβολή'' meaning change and ''nomos'' meaning a rule set or set of laws.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nicholson JK |title=Global systems biology, personalized medicine and molecular epidemiology |journal=Mol. Syst. Biol. |volume=2 |issue= 1|pages=52 |year=2006 |pmid=17016518 |pmc=1682018 |doi=10.1038/msb4100095 |url=}}</ref> This approach was pioneered by Jeremy Nicholson at [[Imperial College London]] and has been used in toxicology, disease diagnosis and a number of other fields.  Historically, the metabonomics approach was one of the first methods to apply the scope of systems biology to studies of metabolism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nicholson JK, Lindon JC, Holmes E |title='Metabonomics': understanding the metabolic responses of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli via multivariate statistical analysis of biological NMR spectroscopic data |journal=Xenobiotica |volume=29 |issue=11 |pages=1181–9 |year=1999 |month=November |pmid=10598751 |doi=10.1080/004982599238047 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Nicholson JK, Connelly J, Lindon JC, Holmes E |title=Metabonomics: a platform for studying drug toxicity and gene function |journal=Nat Rev Drug Discov |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=153–61 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=12120097 |doi= 10.1038/nrd728|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Holmes E, Wilson ID, Nicholson JK |title=Metabolic phenotyping in health and disease |journal=Cell |volume=134 |issue=5 |pages=714–7 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18775301 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2008.08.026 |url=}}</ref>

There has been some disagreement over the exact differences between 'metabolomics' and 'metabonomics'. The difference between the two terms is not related to choice of analytical platform: although metabonomics is more associated with [[NMR spectroscopy]] and metabolomics with [[mass spectrometry]]-based techniques, this is simply because of usages amongst different groups that have popularized the different terms. While there is still no absolute agreement, there is a growing consensus that 'metabolomics' places a greater emphasis on metabolic profiling at a cellular or organ level and is primarily concerned with normal endogenous metabolism. 'Metabonomics' extends metabolic profiling to  include information about perturbations of metabolism caused by environmental factors (including diet and toxins), disease processes, and the involvement of extragenomic  influences, such as gut microflora. This is not a trivial difference; metabolomic studies should, by definition, exclude metabolic contributions from extragenomic sources, because these are external to the system being studied. However, in practice, within the field of human disease research there is still a large degree of overlap in the way both terms are used, and they are often in effect synonymous.<ref name = DGRref>{{cite journal |author=Robertson DG |title=Metabonomics in toxicology: a review |journal=Toxicol.

==Analytical technologies==

===Separation methods===
*[[Gas chromatography]], especially when interfaced with mass spectrometry ([[Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry|GC-MS]]), is one of the most widely used and powerful methods.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} It offers very high chromatographic resolution, but requires chemical derivatization for many biomolecules: only volatile chemicals can be analysed without derivatization. (Some modern instruments allow '2D' chromatography, using a short polar column after the main analytical column, which increases the resolution still further.) Some large and polar metabolites cannot be analysed by [[Gas-liquid chromatography|GC]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schauer N, Steinhauser D, Strelkov S, ''et al.'' |title=GC-MS libraries for the rapid identification of metabolites in complex biological samples |journal=FEBS Lett. |volume=579 |issue=6 |pages=1332–7 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15733837 |doi=10.1016/j.febslet.2005.01.029 |url=}}</ref>

*[[High performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC). Compared to [[Gas-liquid chromatography|GC]], HPLC has lower chromatographic resolution, but it does have the advantage that a much wider range of analytes can potentially be measured.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gika HG, Theodoridis GA, Wingate JE, Wilson ID |title=Within-day reproducibility of an LC-MS-based method for metabonomic analysis: application to human urine |journal=J. Proteome Res. |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=3291–303 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17625818 |doi=10.1021/pr070183p |url=}}</ref>

*[[Capillary electrophoresis]] (CE). CE has a higher theoretical separation efficiency than HPLC, and is suitable for use with a wider range of metabolite classes than is GC. As for all electrophoretic techniques, it is most appropriate for charged analytes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Soga T, Ohashi Y, Ueno Y |title=Quantitative metabolome analysis using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry |journal=J. Proteome Res. |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=488–494 |year=2003 |month=September |pmid=14582645 |doi=10.1021/pr034020m |url= }}</ref>

===Detection methods===
* [[Mass spectrometry]] (MS) is used to identify and to quantify metabolites after separation by [[Gas chromatography|GC]], [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] ([[Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry|LC-MS]]), or [[Capillary electrophoresis|CE]]. [[GC-MS]] is the most 'natural' combination of the three, and was the first to be developed. In addition, mass spectral fingerprint libraries exist or can be developed that allow identification of a metabolite according to its [[fragmentation pattern]]. MS is both sensitive (although, particularly for HPLC-MS, sensitivity is more of an issue as it is affected by the charge on the metabolite, and can be subject to ion suppression artifacts) and can be very specific. There are also a number of studies which use MS as a stand-alone technology: the sample is infused directly into the mass spectrometer with no prior separation, and the MS serves to both separate and to detect metabolites.

* Surface-based mass analysis has seen a resurgence in the past decade, with new MS technologies focused on increasing sensitivity, minimizing background, and reducing sample preparation.  The ability to analyze metabolites directly from biofluids and tissues continues to challenge current MS technology, largely because of the limits imposed by the complexity of these samples, which contain thousands to tens of thousands of metabolites.  Among the technologies being developed to address this challenge is Nanostructure-Initiator MS (NIMS),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Northen T.R, Yanes O, Northen M, Marrinucci D, Uritboonthai W, Apon J, Golledge S, Nordstrom A, Siuzdak G |title=Clathrate nanostructures for mass spectrometry |volume=449 |issue=7165 |pages=1033–6 |year=2007 |journal=Nature |month=October |pmid=17960240 |doi=10.1038/nature06195 |url=|bibcode = 2007Natur.449.1033N }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Woo H, Northern TR, Yanes O, Siuzdak G |title=Nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry: a protocol for preparing and applying NIMS surfaces for high-sensitivity mass analysis |volume=3 |issue=8 |pages=1341–9 |year=2008 |journal=Nature protocols |month=July |pmid=18714302 |doi=10.1038/nprot.2008,110 |url=}}</ref> a desorption/ ionization approach that does not require the application of matrix and thereby facilitates small-molecule (i.e., metabolite) identification. [[MALDI]] is also used however, the application of a MALDI matrix can add significant background at <1000 Da that complicates analysis of the low-mass range (i.e., metabolites). In addition, the size of the resulting matrix crystals limits the spatial resolution that can be achieved in tissue imaging. Because of these limitations, several other matrix-free desorption/ionization approaches have been applied to the analysis of biofluids and tissues. [[Secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS) was one of the first matrix-free desorption/ionization approaches used to analyze metabolites from biological samples. SIMS uses a high-energy primary ion beam to desorb and generate secondary ions from a surface. The primary advantage of SIMS is its high spatial resolution (as small as 50&nbsp;nm), a powerful characteristic for tissue imaging with MS. However, SIMS has yet to be readily applied to the analysis of biofluids and tissues because of its limited sensitivity at >500 Da and analyte fragmentation generated by the high-energy primary ion beam. [[Desorption electrospray ionization]] (DESI) is a matrix-free technique for analyzing biological samples that uses a charged solvent spray to desorb ions from a surface. Advantages of DESI are that no special surface is required and the analysis is performed at ambient pressure with full access to the sample during acquisition.  A limitation of DESI is spatial resolution because "focusing" the charged solvent spray is difficult. However, a recent development termed laser ablation ESI (LAESI) is a promising approach to circumvent this limitation.

*[[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) spectroscopy. NMR is the only detection technique which does not rely on separation of the analytes, and the sample can thus be recovered for further analyses. All kinds of small molecule metabolites can be measured simultaneously - in this sense, NMR is close to being a universal detector. The main advantages of NMR are high analytical reproducibility and simplicity of sample preparation. Practically, however, it is relatively insensitive compared to mass spectrometry-based techniques.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Griffin JL |title=Metabonomics: NMR spectroscopy and pattern recognition analysis of body fluids and tissues for characterisation of xenobiotic toxicity and disease diagnosis |journal=Curr Opin Chem Biol |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=648–54 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=14580571 |doi= 10.1016/j.cbpa.2003.08.008|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Beckonert O, Keun HC, Ebbels TM, ''et al.'' |title=Metabolic profiling, metabolomic and metabonomic procedures for NMR spectroscopy of urine, plasma, serum and tissue extracts |journal=Nat Protoc |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=2692–703 |year=2007 |pmid=18007604 |doi=10.1038/nprot.2007.376 |url=}}</ref>

*Although NMR and MS are the most widely used techniques, other methods of detection that have been used include [[ion-mobility spectrometry]], electrochemical detection (coupled to HPLC) and radiolabel (when combined with thin-layer chromatography).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Statistical methods==
The data generated in metabolomics usually consist of measurements performed on subjects under various conditions. These measurements may be digitized spectra, or a list of metabolite levels. In its simplest form this generates a matrix with rows corresponding to subjects and columns corresponding to metabolite levels.<ref name="VDGarticle"/> Several statistical programs are currently available for analysis of both NMR and [[mass spectrometry]] data.  For mass spectrometry data, software is available that identifies molecules that vary in subject groups on the basis of mass and sometimes retention time depending on the experimental design.  The first comprehensive software to analyze global mass spectrometry-based metabolomics datasets was developed by the Siuzdak laboratory at [[The Scripps Research Institute]] in 2006.  This software, called XCMS, is freely available, has over 20,000 downloads since its inception in 2006,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Smith CA, Want EJ, O'Maille G, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G |title=XCMS: processing mass spectrometry data for metabolite profiling using nonlinear peak alignment, matching, and identification |journal=Anal Chem |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=779–87 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16448051 |doi=10.1021/ac051437y}}</ref> and is one of the most widely cited mass spectrometry-based metabolomics software programs in scientific literature.

It combines xcms package functions and can be used to apply many statistical functions for correcting [[dead time|detector saturation]] using coates correction and creating heat plots. Metabolomics data may also be analyzed by statistical projection ([[chemometrics]]) methods such as [[principal components analysis]] and [[partial least squares regression]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Trygg J, Holmes E, Lundstedt T |title=Chemometrics in metabonomics |journal=J.

==Key applications==
*[[Toxicity]] assessment/[[toxicology]]. Metabolic profiling (especially of urine or blood plasma samples) can be used to detect the physiological changes caused by toxic insult of a chemical (or mixture of chemicals). In many cases, the observed changes can be related to specific syndromes, e.g. a specific lesion in liver or kidney. This is of particular relevance to pharmaceutical companies wanting to test the toxicity of potential [[medication|drug]] candidates: if a compound can be eliminated before it reaches [[clinical trial]]s on the grounds of adverse toxicity, it saves the enormous expense of the trials.<ref name=DGRref/>

*[[Functional genomics]]. Metabolomics can be an excellent tool for determining the [[phenotype]] caused by a genetic manipulation, such as gene deletion or insertion. Sometimes this can be a sufficient goal in itself—for instance, to detect any phenotypic changes in a genetically-modified plant intended for human or animal consumption. More exciting is the prospect of predicting the function of unknown [[gene]]s by comparison with the metabolic perturbations caused by deletion/insertion of known genes. Such advances are most likely to come from [[model organism]]s such as ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''. The [[Benjamin Cravatt III|Cravatt laboratory]] at [[The Scripps Research Institute]] has recently applied this technology to [[mammal]]ian systems, identifying the ''N''-acyltaurines as previously uncharacterized endogenous substrates for the enzyme [[fatty acid amide hydrolase]] (FAAH) and the monoalkylglycerol ethers (MAGEs) as endogenous substrates for the uncharacterized [[hydrolase]] [[KIAA1363]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Saghatelian A, Trauger SA, Want EJ, Hawkins EG, Siuzdak G, Cravatt BF |title=Assignment of endogenous substrates to enzymes by global metabolite profiling |journal=Biochemistry |volume=43 |issue=45 |pages=14332–9 |year=2004 |month=November |pmid=15533037 |doi=10.1021/bi0480335 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Chiang KP, Niessen S, Saghatelian A, Cravatt BF |title=An enzyme that regulates ether lipid signaling pathways in cancer annotated by multidimensional profiling |journal=Chem. Biol. |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=1041–50 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17052608 |doi=10.1016/j.chembiol.2006.08.008 |url=}}</ref>

*[[Nutrigenomics]] is a generalised term which links genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics to human nutrition. In general a metabolome in a given body fluid is influenced by  endogenous factors such as age, sex, body composition and genetics as well as underlying pathologies. The large bowel microflora are also a very significant potential confounder of metabolic profiles and could be classified as either an endogenous or exogenous factor. The main exogenous factors are diet and drugs. Diet can then be broken down to nutrients and non- nutrients.  Metabolomics is one means to determine a biological endpoint, or metabolic fingerprint, which reflects the balance of all these forces on an individual's metabolism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gibney MJ, Walsh M, Brennan L, Roche HM, German B, van Ommen B |title=Metabolomics in human nutrition: opportunities and challenges |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=497–503 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16155259 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Environmental Metabolomics===
*[http://www.springerlink.com/content/41706u15l55j36rl/ Environmental Metabolomics] is the application of metabolomics to characterise the interactions of organisms with their environment. This approach has many advantages for studying organism–environment interactions and for assessing organism function and health at the molecular level. As such, metabolomics is finding an increasing number of applications in the environmental sciences, ranging from understanding organismal responses to abiotic pressures, to investigating the responses of organisms to other biota. These interactions can be studied from individuals to populations, which can be related to the traditional fields of ecophysiology and ecology, and from instantaneous effects to those over evolutionary time scales, the latter enabling studies of genetic adaptation.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bundy JG, Davey MP, Viant MR | year = 2009 | title = Environmental Metabolomics: A Critical Review and Future Perspectives | url = | journal = Metabolomics | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 3–21 | doi = 10.1007/s11306-008-0152-0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Morrison N, Bearden D, Bundy JG, Collette T, Currie F, Davey MP ''et al.'' | year = 2007 | title = Standard Reporting Requirements for Biological Samples in Metabolomics Experiments: Environmental Context | url = | journal = Metabolomics | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 203–210 | doi = 10.1007/s11306-007-0067-1 }}</ref>
