The '''University of Texas Medical Branch''' ('''UTMB''') is a component of the [[University of Texas System]] located in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Texas]], [[United States]], about 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) southeast of [[Downtown Houston|Downtown]] [[Houston]]. It is an academic health center with 11,000 employees <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utmb.edu/business/}}</ref> and a medical school that is the oldest in Texas. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.som.utmb.edu/}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_medical_schools_in_the_United_States}}</ref> 

It was established in 1891 with one building and fewer than 50 students. Today UTMB has grown to more than 70 buildings and an enrollment of more than 2,500 students. The 84-acre <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utmb.edu/about/}}</ref> (339,936 m2) campus includes four schools, three institutes for advanced study, a comprehensive medical library, three on-site hospitals (including an affiliated [[Shriners Hospital for Children (Galveston)]]), a network of clinics that provide primary and specialized medical care and numerous research facilities.

Since its founding, UTMB has served indigent or poor populaces, such as prisoners, the homeless, and single mothers, including patients with ailments that are very expensive to treat (such as burns). It is one of only a handful of hospitals in southeastern Texas that does so. UTMB's Emergency Room at [[John Sealy Hospital]] is certified as a [[Level I Trauma Center]] and serves as the lead trauma facility for the nine-county region in southeast Texas.  It is one of only three Level I Trauma centers in the [[Greater Houston]] area.<ref name=trauma1>{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7491282.html|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|title=UTMB trauma center Level 1 again|author=Ackerman, Todd|date=2011-03-25|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref>

In 2003 UTMB received funding to construct a $150 million [[Galveston National Laboratory|Galveston National Biocontainment Laboratory]] on its campus, one of the few non-military facilities of this level.  It houses several [[Biosafety level|Biosafety Level 4]] research laboratories, where studies on highly infectious materials can be carried out safely. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2003_3694825 |title=UTMB on biowar front line / Lab funded by federal grant will seek defenses for terror 10/01/2003 &#124; Archives &#124; Chron.com - Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref>

It has schools of [[medical school|medicine]], [[nursing]], allied health professions, and a [[graduate school]] of biomedical sciences, as well as an institute for medical humanities.

UTMB also has a major contract with the Texas Department of Corrections to provide medical care to inmates at all TDC sites in the eastern portion of Texas.  UTMB also has similar contracts with local governments needing inmate medical care.

UTMB is currently in the process of recovering from the effects of 2008's [[Hurricane Ike]].<ref name="home page">{{cite web|url=http://www.utmb.edu/|title=UTMB News & Information|accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref><ref>''See also'' {{cite web|url=http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/forums/wcg/viewthread?thread=21894#185264|title=Discovering Dengue Drugs Together project slowed down because of hurricane}}</ref> 

==History==
[[Image:Ashbel Smith Building UTMB Galveston.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ashbel Smith Building|"Old Red"]], the medical school's original building.]]
[[File:Galveston National Laboratory at UTMB.jpg|thumb|right|The Galveston National Laboratory at UTMB is the first full-size [[BSL-4#Biosafety level 4|BSL-4]] lab located on a university campus in the United States.]] 
[[File:John Sealy Hospital UTMB.jpg|thumb|right|"John Sealy Hospital"]]
The location of the Medical Department of the [[University of Texas System|University of Texas]] was decided between Galveston and [[Houston]] in a popular vote in 1881, but its opening was delayed due to the construction of the [[University of Texas at Austin|main university campus]] in [[Austin, Texas]].  The need for medical training in Texas was great: in 1891, 80% of doctors in the state had under a year of formal training in medicine, and so the "Texas Medical College" was formed in Galveston with the idea that it would become the medical department once state funding began.   

The original building, now called Old Red, was begun on 1890 under the supervision of the Galveston architect [[Nicholas J. Clayton]].  Clayton toured several medical colleges in the North and East before drawing up his plans for the building.  The medical school campus also included the [[John Sealy Hospital]], which provided charity care for any who claimed Galveston residence.

Upon opening, the Red Building had been starkly underfurnished, a problem which was not fully remedied until after the [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900|Hurricane of 1900]], when the state rallied around the ravaged city.  Dr. Thompson, professor of surgery, said that "the regents were so generous in repairing the damage to the building and restoring the equipment, that we were actually in better shape at the end of the year 1901 than we had been before."  In addition, the damage to the roof of Old Red allowed for the addition of sky lights, which had always been wanted for the dissection room.

In 1915 the medical branch built the first hospital dedicated to children in Texas.  By 1924 UTMB had established the first department of pediatrics in the state of Texas — which was also one of the first departments of pediatrics in the United States.<ref name=Child>{{cite news|url= http://galvestondailynews.com/story/307150/ |work=[[Galveston Daily News]]|title=UTMB's Children's Hospital makes its debut|author= Dannenmaier, Molly|date=2012-04-17|accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref>
 
From its modest beginnings in the 1890s as the first state medical school in Texas, the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) has developed into a large, sophisticated health science complex with numerous schools and institutes, including: a Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, School of Medicine, School of Nursing, School of Health Professions, Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, Institute for the Medical Humanities, an affiliated Shriners Burns Hospital, the Sealy Center for Molecular Medicine, the Sealy Center for Structural Biology, the Center for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases, the Center for Addiction Research, the Educational Cancer Center, the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Women’s Health, the Institute for Translational Sciences,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.its.utmb.edu/ctsalinks.htm |title=ITS - Institute for Translational Sciences |publisher=Its.utmb.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref>  the Galveston National Laboratory (GNL), the Sealy Center for Cancer Cell Biology, the Sealy Center for Environmental Health and Medicine, the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Tropical Diseases, the Stark Diabetes Center, the Center for Biomedical Engineering, the Center for Environmental Toxicology, the Sealy Center on Aging, the George P. and Cynthia Woods Mitchell Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, and the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development. UTMB operates an extensive clinical care enterprise with a wide variety of specialty programs.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

UTMB’s annual budget of approximately $1.4 billion includes grants, awards, and contracts from federal and private sources totaling more than $150 million, in addition to institutional allocations for research.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In 1996, UTMB purchased the adjacent 128 year old [[St. Mary's Hospital, Galveston|St. Mary's Hospital]], the first catholic hospital in Texas.<ref name="maryclose">{{Cite news| title = St. Mary's Hospital will close/UT branch to buy 128-year-old unit | publisher= [[Houston Chronicle]] | accessdate = 2009-10-03 | url = http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1995_1314679}}</ref> The building was converted into the Rebecca Sealy Psychiatric Hospital.

UTMB became a member of the Houston-based [[Texas Medical Center]] in 2010.  Wollam, Allison. <ref>.

Dr. Danny O. Jacobs, a former Department Chair at Duke University, has been named executive vice president, provost and dean of the School of Medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch, effective Oct. 1 2012]. <ref>"http://galvestondailynews.com/story/330618"</ref>

==Schools==
UTMB includes four schools:

*'''School of Medicine''' - The School of Medicine [http://www.som.utmb.edu/] at UTMB has provided medical school or residency training to one in six Texas physicians. With 20 departments, three institutes and a unique partnership with the University of Texas in Austin and Seton Healthcare in Austin, UTMB’s School of Medicine is a leader in medical school education, translational research and clinical care. The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) is a major academic health center in the fields of health sciences education, clinical care and biomedical research. Opened in 1891.

*'''Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences''' - The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS) is one of four degree-granting schools at UTMB and plays a major role in research and scholarship at the university [http://gsbs.utmb.edu]. Biomedical graduate programs were started in 1952, and a separate graduate school was established in 1969, becoming the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences in 1972. There are 323 faculty members in the graduate school. UTMB maintains an excellent faculty-to-student ratio, with 341 graduate students enrolled. Every year approximately 50 graduate students enroll, and as of August 2006, there are 1,255 GSBS alumni who have gone on to diverse successful careers.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}<br />The graduate school has 11 degree-granting programs: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology [http://www.hbcg.utmb.edu/], Cell Biology,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utmb.edu/ncb/graduateprograms/cellbiology/cellbiologyprogram.asp |title=Cell Biology Program |publisher=Utmb.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref>  Cellular Physiology and Molecular Biophysics, Experimental Pathology,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utmb.edu/pathology/ |title=Department of Pathology Home Page |publisher=Utmb.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref>  Master of Medical Sciences,<ref>[http://www.gsbs.utmb.edu/master_medical_science/default.html ]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref>  Medical Humanities [http://www.utmb.edu/imh/], Microbiology and Immunology [http://microbiology.utmb.edu/], Neurosciences,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utmb.edu/ncb/graduateprograms/neuroscience/NeuroscienceGraduateProgram.asp |title=Neuroscience Graduate Program |publisher=Utmb.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref>  Nursing,<ref>[http://www.son.utmb.edu/studentaffairs/programs/doctoral/index.html ]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref>  Pharmacology and Toxicology [http://www.utmb.edu/phtox/], and Preventive Medicine and Community Health [http://www.utmb.edu/pmch/]. Most of the programs and their facilities are closely allied with their medical school departments and also interact in interdisciplinary and clinical pursuits. An M.D./Ph.D. Combined Degree Program [http://www.utmb.edu/mdphd/] is offered in conjunction with the UTMB School of Medicine.<br />The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences provides a basic science background for its students.<br />The GSBS and the UT Telecampus [http://www.telecampus.utsystem.edu/] have created a concurrent enrollment program by which graduate students at UTMB can pursue both a Ph.D. and an M.B.A. in preparation for careers in biotechnology and the pharmaceutical industry, among other career opportunities.<br/>For more information: http://www.gsbs.utmb.edu/
''Sources of Financial Support''<br />Every effort is made to provide financial support for GSBS students. Students may qualify for predoctoral fellowships from the graduate school with an initial stipend of at least $27,000 (2010–2011), and paid health insurance for those pursuing a Ph.D. degree. These stipends are awarded according to merit and the recommendation of the program faculty. Tuition and fees for first-year BBSC students will be paid by the GSBS and the mentor will fund tuition fees in years thereafter. Financial support may be available from other sources for students engaged in research or teaching projects. James W. McLaughlin Fellowships are awarded primarily to advanced students concentrating in the areas of infection and immunity and include additional benefits for dependents, travel, and research supplies. Research grant support is normally available only to students who have decided on laboratories in which they wish to work and have chosen research projects. A number of NIH-funded training grants also provide stipend support to Ph.D. students on a competitive basis.

==Hurricane Ike==

Hurricane Ike caused significant flood damage to nearly every building on campus, including the John Sealy Hospital. However, UTMB has about $1.4 billion to restore, harden and expand its campus. Much of the money was approved by the 81st Texas Legislative session, $450 million comes from FEMA, $130 million from insurance, $200 million from the [[Sealy and Smith Foundation]], and $50 million from the Social Service Block Grant Funds.<ref>[http://www.utmb.edu/iutmb/more/Legislature_06-01-09.asp ]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref>  Reconstruction is actively underway as well as hardening of the campus to protect buildings and resources from future storms.  It should be noted that UTMB restored its educational programs within weeks after the Hurricane Ike and the research endeavor came back steadily thereafter.  In 2011 the foundation committed $170 million towards the construction of a new Jennie Sealy Hospital on the UTMB campus, an amount that represents the largest single gift ever to a Texas health institution.<ref name=hbj1>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2011/08/25/utmb-galveston-to-construct-new-438m.html|title=UTMB Galveston to build $438M hospital|work=[[Houston Business Journal]]|author=Dawson, Jennifer|date=2011-08-25|accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>
