The '''lacrimal bone''', the smallest and most fragile [[bone]] of the face, is situated at the front part of the medial wall of the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]. It has two surfaces and four borders.

==Surfaces==
===Lateral or orbital surface===
The lateral or orbital surface is divided by a vertical ridge, the [[posterior lacrimal crest]], into two parts.

In ''front'' of this crest is a longitudinal groove, the [[lacrimal sulcus]] (''sulcus lacrimalis''), the inner margin of which unites with the frontal process of the [[maxilla]], and the [[fossa for lacrimal sac|lacrimal fossa]] is thus completed. The upper part of this fossa lodges the [[lacrimal sac]], the lower part, the [[nasolacrimal duct]].

The portion ''behind'' the crest is smooth, and forms part of the medial wall of the orbit.

The crest, with a part of the orbital surface immediately behind it, gives origin to the lacrimal part of the [[Orbicularis oculi]] and ends below in a small, hook-like projection, the [[lacrimal hamulus]], which articulates with the [[lacrimal tubercle of the maxilla]], and completes the upper orifice of the [[nasolacrimal canal]]; the hamulus sometimes exists as a separate piece, and is then called the [[lesser lacrimal bone]].

===Medial or nasal surface===
The medial or nasal surface presents a longitudinal furrow, corresponding to the crest on the lateral surface.

The area in front of this furrow forms part of the middle [[meatus]] of the nose; that behind it articulates with the [[ethmoid]], and completes some of the [[anterior ethmoidal cells]].

==Borders==
Of the four borders:
* the ''anterior'' articulates with the frontal process of the maxilla;
* the ''posterior'' with the [[lamina papyracea]] of the ethmoid;
* the ''superior'' with the frontal bone.
* The ''inferior'' is divided by the lower edge of the posterior lacrimal crest into two parts:
** the posterior part articulates with the orbital plate of the maxilla;
** the anterior is prolonged downward as the descending process, which articulates with the lacrimal process of the [[inferior nasal concha]], and assists in forming the canal for the nasolacrimal duct.

==Ossification==
The lacrimal is ossified from a single center, which appears about the twelfth week in the membrane covering the cartilaginous nasal capsule.

==Articulations==
The lacrimal articulates with four bones: two of the cranium, the [[frontal bone|frontal]] and [[ethmoid bone|ethmoid]], and two of the face, the [[maxilla]] and the inferior nasal concha.

==In other animals==
In early [[lobe-finned fish]]es and ancestral [[tetrapod]]s, the lacrimal bone is a relatively large and robust bone, running from the orbit to the nostrils. It forms part of the side of the face, between the [[nasal bone]]s and the maxilla. In primitive forms, it is often accompanied by a much smaller [[septomaxilla]] bone, lying immediately behind the nasal opening, but this is lost in most modern species. The lacrimal bone is often smaller in living vertebrates, and is no longer always directly associated with the nasal opening, although it retains its connection with the orbit. The bone is entirely absent in living [[amphibian]]s, as well as some reptilian species.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 217â€“241|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>
