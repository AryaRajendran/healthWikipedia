'''Balo concentric sclerosis''' is one of the [[multiple sclerosis borderline|borderline forms of multiple sclerosis]].

Balo concentric sclerosis is a demyelinating disease similar to standard [[multiple sclerosis]], but with the particularity that the demyelinated tissues form concentric layers. Scientists used to believe that the prognosis was similar to [[Marburg multiple sclerosis]], but now they know that patients can survive, or even have spontaneous remission and asymptomatic cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Karaarslan E, Altintas A, Senol U, ''et al.'' |title=Baló's concentric sclerosis: clinical and radiologic features of five cases |journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=1362–7 |year=2001 |month=August |pmid=11498428 |url=http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/content/full/22/7/1362}}</ref>

It is also common that the clinical course is primary progressive, but a relapsing-remitting course has been reported.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moore GR, Berry K, Oger JJ, Prout AJ, Graeb DA, Nugent RA |title=Baló's concentric sclerosis: surviving normal myelin in a patient with a relapsing-remitting dinical course |journal=Mult. Scler. |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=375–82 |year=2001 |month=December |pmid=11795459 |doi=10.1177/135245850100700606}}</ref>
It seems that the course gets better with prednisone therapy,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Garbern J, Spence AM, Alvord EC |title=Balo's concentric demyelination diagnosed premortem |journal=Neurology |volume=36 |issue=12 |pages=1610–4 |year=1986 |month=December |pmid=3785678 |doi=10.1212/WNL.36.12.1610 }}</ref> although evidence of this is anecdotal and such conclusions are difficult to accept given that there are cases where patients spontaneously recover whether the patient was on steroid therapy or not.

==Pathophysiology==

The lesions of the Balo sclerosis belong to the [[Pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis#Demyelination patterns|MS lesion pattern III]] (distal oligodendrogliopathy).<ref>[http://www.fedem.org/revista/n13/actualidad.html (Article in Spanish)]</ref>

According with Dr. Lucchinetti investigations, in Balo's concentric sclerosis, the rings may be caused by a physiological hypoxia (similar to that caused by some toxins or viruses) in the lesion, which is in turn countered by expression of stress proteins at the border. This expression and counter-expression forms rings of preserved tissue within the lesion and rings of demyelinated tissue just beyond where the previous attack had induced the protective stress proteins. Hence, subsequent attacks form concentric rings.<ref>Genetic susceptibility in MS – Steve Hauser. Rare Neuroimmunologic Disorders Symposium [http://www.acceleratedcure.org:8080/article.pl?sid=06/07/26/1117237&m]</ref> 

Ultimately, this expanding lesion causes the progressive picture typically seen. However, in some patients, the pathology underlying the disease appears to burn out and hence the disease may halt, hence the patients who spontaneously recover. The mechanisms triggering attacks and recovery remain uncertain.

Recently, a mathematical model for concentric sclerosis has been proposed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Khonsari RH, Calvez V |title=The Origins of Concentric Demyelination: Self-Organization in the Human Brain |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=e150 |year=2007 |pmid=17225855 |pmc=1764710 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000150  |editor1-last=Monk |editor1-first=Nick}}</ref> Authors review the previous pathogenic theories, discuss the link between concentric sclerosis and [[Liesegang rings|Liesegang's periodic precipitation phenomenon]] and propose a new mechanism based on self-organization.

===Lesions under autopsy and biopsy===

A report comparing 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, magnetization transfer and diffusion tensor imaging with histopathology in a patient with Balo's concentric sclerosis, found that inflammation was traced by fractional anisotropy and increased lactate. In contrast, magnetization transfer ratio and the diffusion coefficient show a loss of tissue in the rings of the lesion.<ref>S. Lindquist, Histopathology and serial, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging in a multiple sclerosis variant, Mult Scler May 2007 vol. 13 no. 4 471-482</ref>

==Epidemiology==

The disease is more common in Chinese and Filipino populations (both [[mongoloid|Asiatic]]) than in [[caucasoid]]s.<ref>[http://www.mult-sclerosis.org/Balosconcentricsclerosis.html Article at mult-sclerosis.org]</ref>
