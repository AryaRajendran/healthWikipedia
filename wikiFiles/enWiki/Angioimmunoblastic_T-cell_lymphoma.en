==Epidemiology==
The typical patient with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AILT) is either middle-aged or elderly, and no gender preference for this disease has been observed.<ref name=who1/> AILT comprises 15-20% of peripheral T-cell lymphomas and 1-2% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas.<ref name=anon1>{{cite journal |title=A clinical evaluation of the International Lymphoma Study Group classification of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

==Clinical features==
===Etiology===
This disease was originally thought to be a premalignant condition, termed angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy, and this atypical reactive lymphadenopathy carried a risk for transformation into a lymphoma. Currently, it is postulated that the originating cell for this disease is a mature (post-thymic) CD4+ [[T-cell]] that arises ''de novo'',<ref name=who1/> although some researchers argue that there is a premalignant subtype of this disease.<ref name=fri1>{{cite journal |author=Frizzera G, Kaneko Y, Sakurai M |title=Angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy and related disorders: a retrospective look in search of definitions |journal=Leukemia |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–5 |year=1989 |month=January |pmid=2642571 }}

</ref> Immunodeficiency is also seen with this disease, but it is a sequela to the condition and not a predisposing factor.<ref name=who1/>

===Clinical presentation===
Patients with this disease usually present at an advanced stage and show [[Systemic disease|systemic]] involvement. The [[Medical sign|clinical findings]] typically include a pruritic skin rash and possibly [[edema]], [[ascites]], [[pleural effusion]]s, and [[arthritis]].<ref name=sie1>{{cite journal |author=Siegert W, Nerl C, Agthe A, ''et al.'' |title=Angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (AILD)-type T-cell lymphoma: prognostic impact of clinical observations and laboratory findings at presentation.

===Laboratory findings===
The classical laboratory finding is polyclonal [[hypergammaglobulinemia]], and other [[immunoglobulin]] derangements are also seen, including [[hemolytic anemia]] with [[cold agglutinins]], circulating immune complexes, anti-smooth muscle antibodies, and positive [[rheumatoid factor]].<ref name=who1/><ref name=sie1/>

===Sites of involvement===
Due to the systemic nature of this disease, neoplastic cells can be found in [[lymph nodes]], [[liver]], [[spleen]], [[skin]], and [[bone marrow]].

==Morphology==
===Lymph node===
The normal architecture of a lymph node is partially effaced by a polymorphous infiltrate and residual follicles are commonly seen. The polymorphous infiltrate consists of lymphocytes of moderate size with pale/clear cytoplasm and smaller reactive [[lymphocytes]], [[eosinophils]], [[histiocytes]], [[plasma cells]], and [[follicular dendritic cells]]. In addition, blast-like [[B-cells]] are occasionally seen. A classic morphological finding is the aborization and proliferation of [[high endothelial venules]].<ref name=who1/> Hyperplastic [[germinal centers]] and [[Reed-Sternberg cells]] can also be seen.<ref name=quin1>{{cite journal |author=Quintanilla-Martinez L, Fend F, Moguel LR, ''et al.'' |title=Peripheral T-cell lymphoma with Reed-Sternberg-like cells of B-cell phenotype and genotype associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection |journal=Am.

==Molecular findings==
===Immunophenotype===
AILT typically has the phenotype of a mixture of [[CD4]]+ and [[CD8]]+ [[T-cells]], with a CD4:CD8 ratio greater than unity. Polyclonal [[plasma cells]] and [[CD21]]+ [[follicular dendritic cells]] are also seen.<ref name=who1/>

===Genetic findings===
Clonal [[T-cell receptor]] gene rearrangements are detected in 75% of cases,<ref name=fell1>{{cite journal |author=Feller AC, Griesser H, Schilling CV, ''et al.'' |title=Clonal gene rearrangement patterns correlate with immunophenotype and clinical parameters in patients with angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy |journal=Am.
