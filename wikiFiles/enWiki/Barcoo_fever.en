'''Barcoo fever''' is an illness once common in the [[Outback|Australian outback]] that is now virtually unknown. It was characterised by nausea and vomiting exacerbated by the sight or smell of food and, unlike the usual gastro-intestinal infections, by [[constipation]] rather than [[diarrhoea]]. [[Fever]] and [[myalgia]] were also symptoms. Severe cases developed [[Starvation|inanition]] and even death. It was seen in travelers in the outback rather than in cities or towns, but occasionally entire settlements were affected, such as occurred in [[Toowoomba]] in 1903. The [[Indigenous Australians|aboriginal population]] knew to avoid the ailment by not drinking from certain water sources and by taking water from soaks or pits dug in the dry sandy bed of a stream.

It is postulated that the disease may be due to ingestion of [[cyanobacteria]]l (blue-green algal) [[toxin]]s,<ref name="Barceloux2008">{{cite book|last=Barceloux|first=Donald G.|title=Medical toxicology of natural substances: foods, fungi, medicinal herbs, plants, and venomous animals|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HWUzlp_V6uIC&pg=PA181|accessdate=17 August 2011|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-471-72761-3|pages=181–}}</ref> in particular [[cylindrospermopsin]], a toxin from ''Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii'' and other cyanobacteria, which is a [[hepatotoxin]]. The symptoms of the disease are consistent with a [[hepatitis]] or liver disorder, and ''Cylindrospermopsis'' is known to be widespread in inland Australian water sources. The toxin is not destroyed by boiling and, although it would flavor water, this flavor would be masked by tea, the common beverage in the [[The Bush|Australian bush]]. Provision of safe drinking water sources in Australia, with the development of bores and covered tanks to collect rainwater, explain the demise of a once-common illness.
