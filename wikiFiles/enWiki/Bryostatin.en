'''Bryostatins''' are a group of [[macrolide]] [[lactone]]s first isolated in the 1960s by George Pettit from extracts of a species of [[bryozoan]], ''Bugula neritina''. The structure of bryostatin 1 was determined in 1982.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Pettit GR, Cherry Herald L, Doubek DL, Herald DL, Arnold E, Clardy J | title = Isolation and structure of bryostatin 1 | journal = J.

== Biological effects ==

Bryostatin 1 is a potent modulator of [[protein kinase C]] (PKC). Short-term effects of bryostatin 1 include activation of classical or conventional PKCs and novel PKCs, whereas prolonged presence leads to lowered PKC activation. Bryostatin 1 effects on different isoforms of PKC vary. In ''in vitro'' tests bryostatin 1 was able to inhibit cell growth and [[angiogenesis]] and to excite cell differentiation and [[apoptosis]]. Bryostatin also shows immunomodulatory properties.<ref name="pmid17585335">{{cite journal | author = Mackay HJ, Twelves CJ | title = Targeting the protein kinase C family: are we there yet? | journal = Nat.

In ''[[in vitro]]'' trials bryostatin 1 was able to induce apoptosis in HL-60 chronic lymphocytic [[leukaemia]]. It could be shown that bryostatin 1 acts [[synergy|synergistically]] in combination with other anti-cancer drugs. Drug combination was effective against a large variety of [[tumor]] cells including lung, prostate and [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] tumor cells. Although animal studies were promising, bryostatin 1 as a single drug has failed to demonstrate significant activity in tumor patients in phase II trials in a wide range of tumor types, including [[melanoma]] and colorectal cancer. Additionally severe side-effects, mainly [[myalgia]], were observed after bryostatin administration. As a consequence research focus has shifted to an investigation of combination therapy with other [[chemotherapy|chemotherapeutic]] antitumor agents such as [[gemcitabine]], [[vincristine]], [[cisplatin]], and [[paclitaxel]]. 

Bryostatin 1 has appeared very promising in enhancing memory in animal models. It was able to increase the duration of memory retention of the marine slug ''[[Hermissenda crassicornis]]'' by over 500%.<ref name="pmid16801495">{{cite journal | author = Kuzirian AM, Epstein HT, Gagliardi CJ, Nelson TJ, Sakakibara M, Taylor C, Scioletti AB, Alkon DL | title = Bryostatin enhancement of memory in Hermissenda | journal = Biol.

== Synthesis  ==

The low concentration in bryozoans (to extract one gram of bryostatin, roughly one tonne of the raw bryozoans is needed) makes extraction unviable for large scale production. Due to the structural complexity, total synthesis has proved difficult, with only a few total syntheses reported so far. Total syntheses have been published for bryostatin 1, 2, 3, 7, 9 and 16.<ref>
