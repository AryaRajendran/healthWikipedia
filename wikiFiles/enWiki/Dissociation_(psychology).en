{{About|the psychological experience||Dissociation (disambiguation)}}
'''Dissociation''' is a term in [[psychology]] describing a wide array of experiences from mild detachment from immediate surroundings to more severe detachment from physical and emotional experience. It is commonly displayed on a [[Continuum (measurement)|continuum]].<ref name="Dell2009">{{cite book | authors = Dell, P. F., & O'Neil, J. A. | year = 2009 | chapter = Preface | editors = P.F.

More pathological dissociation involves [[dissociative disorder]]s, including [[dissociative fugue]] and [[depersonalization disorder]] with or without alterations in personal identity or sense of self. These alterations can include: a sense that self or the world is unreal ([[depersonalization]] and [[derealization]]); a loss of memory ([[amnesia]]); forgetting identity or assuming a new self (fugue); and fragmentation of identity or self into separate streams of consciousness ([[dissociative identity disorder]], formerly termed multiple personality disorder) and [[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Coons PM |title=Psychogenic or dissociative fugue: a clinical investigation of five cases |journal=Psychological Reports |volume=84 |issue=3 Pt 1 |pages=881–6 |year=1999 |month=June |pmid=10408212 |doi= 10.2466/PR0.84.3.881-886|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kritchevsky M, Chang J, Squire LR |title=Functional Amnesia: Clinical Description and Neuropsychological Profile of 10 Cases |journal=Learning and Memory |volume=11|pages=213–26 |year=2004 |pmid=15054137 |pmc=379692 |doi=10.1101/lm.71404 |url=}}</ref>  Dissociative disorders are sometimes triggered by trauma, but may be preceded only by stress, psychoactive substances, or no identifiable trigger at all.<ref>{{cite book |author=Abugel J & Simeon D |title=Feeling unreal: depersonalization disorder and the loss of the self |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |year=2006 | pages= 17 |isbn=0-19-517022-9 |doi= |accessdate=| url = http://books.google.com/?id=M-Cgs_T7Cl8C&pg=PA17}}</ref> The [[ICD-10]] classifies [[conversion disorder]] as a [[dissociative disorder]].<ref name="Dell2009"/>  The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] groups all dissociative disorders into a single category.<ref>{{cite book | last = American Psychiatric Association | authorlink = American Psychiatric Association | title = [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (Text Revision)]] | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=3SQrtpnHb9MC&pg=PA519&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false 519–534] | date = 2000-06 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. | location = Arlington, VA, USA | isbn = 978-0-89042-024-9 | doi = 10.1176/appi.books.9780890423349 }}</ref>

Due to their unexpected and largely inexplicable nature, they tend to be quite unsettling.

== History ==
The [[French people|French]] philosopher and [[psychiatrist]] [[Pierre Janet]] (1859–1947) is considered to be the author of the concept of dissociation.<ref name = Ellenberger>{{cite book |author=Ellenberger | first = H. F. |title=The discovery of the unconscious: the history and evolution of dynamic psychiatry |publisher=BasicBooks |location=New York |year=1970 |pages= |isbn=0-465-01673-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Contrary to some conceptions of dissociation, Janet did not believe that dissociation was a psychological defense.<ref>{{cite book | last = Janet | first = P | authorlink = Pierre Janet | year = 1893/1901/1977 | title = The mental state of hystericals: A study of mental stigmata and mental accidents | location = Washington, DC | publisher = University Publications of America | url = http://books.google.com/?id=6OctAAAAIAAJ | isbn = 0-89093-166-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Janet | first= P | authorlink = Pierre Janet | year = 1920/1929/1965 | title = The major symptoms of hysteria | url = http://books.google.com/?id=yyQ6AAAAMAAJ | location = New York | publisher = Hafner Publishing Company | isbn = 1-4325-0431-2 }}</ref> Psychological [[defense mechanism]]s belong to Freud's theory of [[psychoanalysis]], not to Janetian psychology.  Janet claimed that dissociation occurred only in persons who had a constitutional weakness of mental functioning that led to [[hysteria]] when they were [[Stress (biological)|stressed]]. Although it is true that many of Janet's [[Case study|case histories]] described traumatic experiences, he never considered dissociation to be a defense against those experiences. Quite the opposite: Janet insisted that dissociation was a mental or cognitive deficit. Accordingly, he considered trauma to be one of many stressors that could worsen the already-impaired "mental efficiency" of a hysteric, thereby generating a cascade of hysterical (in today's language, "dissociative") symptoms.<ref name = Ellenberger/><ref>{{cite book | last = McDougall | first = W | year = 1926| title = Outline of abnormal psychology| url = http://books.google.com/?id=86pWAAAAMAAJ  | location = New York | publisher = [[Charles Scribner's Sons]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Mitchell | first = TW | year = 1921 | title = The psychology of medicine | location = London | publisher = Methuen | isbn = 0-8274-4240-8 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=k1cwAAAACAAJ}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Mitchell | first = TW | year = 1923/2007 | title = Medical psychology and psychical research | location = New York | publisher = [[E.

Although there was great interest in dissociation during the last two decades of the nineteenth century (especially in France and England), this interest rapidly waned with the coming of the new century.<ref name=Ellenberger/> Even Janet largely turned his attention to other matters. On the other hand, there was a sharp peak in interest in dissociation in America from 1890 to 1910, especially in Boston as reflected in the work of [[William James]], [[Boris Sidis]], [[Morton Prince]], and [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]]. Nevertheless, even in America, interest in dissociation rapidly succumbed to the surging academic interest in psychoanalysis and behaviorism. For most of the twentieth century, there was little interest in dissociation. Discussion of dissociation only resumed when [[Ernest Hilgard]] (1977) published his neodissociation theory in the 1970s and when several authors wrote about multiple personality in the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[Carl Jung]] described pathological manifestations of dissociation as special or extreme cases of the normal operation of the psyche. This structural dissociation, opposing tension, and hierarchy of basic [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and functions in normal individual consciousness is the basis of Jung's ''[[Psychological Types]]''.<ref name=Jung1991>{{cite book | author = Jung, C.G. | year = 1991 | title = Psychological types | publisher = Routledge London | isbn = 978-0-7100-6299-4 }}</ref> He theorized that dissociation is a natural necessity for consciousness to operate in one faculty unhampered by the demands of its opposite.

Attention to dissociation as a clinical feature has been growing in recent years as knowledge of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] increased, due to interest in [[dissociative identity disorder]] and the [[multiple personality controversy]], and as [[neuroimaging]] research and population studies show its relevance.<ref>{{cite book | last = Scaer | first = Robert C. | title = The Body Bears the Burden: Trauma, Dissociation, and Disease | publisher = Haworth Medical Press | year = 2001 | location = Binghamton, NY | pages = 97–126 | isbn = 0-7890-1246-4 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=C30EbO7GDMIC&pg=PA97}}</ref>

== Measurement and diagnosis of dissociative disorder ==
{{Main|dissociative disorder}}
Dissociation in community samples is most commonly measured by the [[Dissociative Experiences Scale]]. The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]]'' considers symptoms such as [[depersonalization]], [[derealization]] and [[psychogenic amnesia]] to be core features of [[dissociative disorder]]s.<ref name="DissociativeDisorders">[http://www.psychiatryonline.com/content.aspx?aID=9696 Dissociative Disorders ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition )]</ref>  However, in the normal population dissociative experiences that are not clinically significant are highly prevalent, with 60% to 65% of the respondents indicating that they have had some dissociative experiences.<ref name=OccrRef04102007>{{cite journal | author = Waller, N.G. | coauthors = Putnam, F.W.; Carlson, E.B. | year = 1996 | title = Types of dissociation and dissociative types: A taxometric analysis of dissociative experiences | journal = Psychological Methods | volume = 1 | pages = 300–321 | url = http://www.psych.umn.edu/faculty/waller/classes/mult06/taxometrics/wallerputnam.pdf  | accessdate = 2008-01-31 | doi = 10.1037/1082-989X.1.3.300 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080414011336/http://www.psych.umn.edu/faculty/waller/classes/mult06/taxometrics/wallerputnam.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-14}}</ref>  The [[Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV#SCID-D|SCID-D]] is a structured interview used to assess and diagnose dissociation.

== Relation to trauma and abuse ==
Dissociation has been described as one of a constellation of symptoms experienced by some victims of multiple forms of childhood [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], including [[physical abuse|physical]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], and [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]].<ref name=salter>{{cite book|title=Transforming Trauma: A Guide to Understanding and Treating Adult Survivors |first=Anna C. |last=Salter, Dr |coauthors=Hilary Eldridge |pages=220 | year=1995 |publisher=Sage Publications Inc |isbn= 0-8039-5509-X}}</ref><ref name=Myers>{{cite book |title=The APSAC Handbook on Child Maltreatment, Second Edition |first=John E.B. |last=Myers |pages=63 |publisher=Sage Publications |year=2002 |isbn= 0-7619-1992-9}}</ref> This is supported by studies which suggest that dissociation is correlated with a history of trauma.<ref name="pmid8659645">{{cite journal | author = van der Kolk, B.A. et al. | title = Dissociation, somatization, and affect dysregulation: the complexity of adaptation of trauma | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 153 | issue = 7 Suppl | pages = 83–93 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8659645 | doi = | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8659645 | accessdate = 2008-05-13}}</ref>  Dissociation appears to have a high [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] and a low [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] to having a self-reported history of trauma, which means that dissociation is much more common among those who are traumatized, yet at the same time there are many persons who have suffered from trauma but who do not show dissociative symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Briere J |title=Dissociative symptoms and trauma exposure: specificity, affect dysregulation, and posttraumatic stress |journal=Journal of Nervous and Mental Disorders |volume=194 |pages=78–82 |year=2006 |pmid=16477184 |doi=10.1097/01.nmd.0000198139.47371.54 |url=http://www.johnbriere.com/JNMD%2006%20paper.html}}</ref>

Adult dissociation when comorbid with a history of [[child abuse]] and otherwise interpersonal violence-related [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) has been shown to contribute to disturbances in parenting behavior, such as exposure of young children to violent media. Such behavior may contribute to cycles of familial violence and trauma.<ref>[[Daniel Schechter|Schechter DS]], Gross A. et al.(2009). Is maternal PTSD associated with greater exposure of very young children to violent media? Journal of Trauma and Stress. 22(6), 658-62.</ref>

Symptoms of dissociation resulting from trauma may include [[depersonalization]], [[psychological numbing]], [[Apathy|disengagement]], or amnesia regarding the events of the abuse. It has been hypothesized that dissociation may provide a temporarily effective defense mechanism in cases of severe trauma; however, in the long term, dissociation is associated with decreased psychological functioning and adjustment.<ref name=Myers/>  Other symptoms sometimes found along with dissociation in victims of traumatic abuse (often referred to as "sequelae to abuse") include anxiety, PTSD, low [[self-esteem]], somatization, depression, chronic pain, interpersonal dysfunction, substance abuse, self-mutilation and suicidal ideation or actions.<ref name=salter/><ref name=Myers/><ref name=briere1992>{{cite journal |url=http://www.johnbriere.com/methodological%20csa%20jccp%201992.pdf |format=PDF|title=Methodological Issues in the Study of Sexual Abuse Effects  |author=Briere, John |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |year=1992 |pages=196–203 |volume= 60 |pmid=1592948 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.60.2.196 |issue=2}}</ref>  These symptoms may lead the victim to erroneously present the symptoms as the source of the problem.<ref name=salter/>
