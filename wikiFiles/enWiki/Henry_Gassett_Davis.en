 

'''Henry Gassett Davis'''  (November 4, 1807, [[Trenton, Maine]] – November 18, 1896, [[Everett, Massachusetts]]) was an [[Orthopedic surgery|orthopedic surgeon]].<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4896256</ref>

He founded the [[Traction (orthopedics)|traction]] school of orthopedic surgery and created the first [[Splint (medicine)|splint]] for traction and protection of the hip joint. Davis is also known for his work in studying soft tissue adaptation<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Henry Gassett|title=Conservative Surgery|year=1867|publisher=D. Appleton & Co.|location=New York|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5gycXSqzr7oC}}</ref> (see [[Davis' law]]). 

==Early life==

Henry was a later descendent of Dolor Davis of early [[Cape Cod, Massachusetts]]. As a boy he intended to be a mechanic and a manufacturer of cotton bagging, similar to his father. But upon visiting his sister, diagnosed with a difficult case of [[scoliosis]], he abandoned his earlier goals to pursue medicine.

===Education===

In March 1839 he received his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from [[Yale Medical School|Yale School of Medicine]] with clinical training at [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue Hospital]] in [[New York City]]. He was a [[Family practitioner|practitioner]] and surgeon in both  [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] and [[Millbury, Massachusetts|Millbury]], [[Massachusetts]] for fifteen years. He  then settled in New York City where he specialized in orthopedic medicine. 

While in Millbury, he grew interested in the treatment of fractures and deformities and advocated the use of continuous traction to correct deformities and relieve joint discomfort. His successful work with weights and pulleys preceded Gurdon Buck's similar introductions of 1860. His practice bloomed and he soon opened a private hospital at 37th Street and [[Madison Avenue, Manhattan|Madison Avenue]] in [[Manhattan]] primarily for foreign patients. 

His beliefs formed the basis for the modern day approaches to such medical conditions as [[club foot]], congenital dislocation of the hip, chronic joint diseases and [[Poliomyelitis]] related deformities. He recommended opening and evacuating [[abscess]]es and washing them with warm water and chlorine, an early form of the more modern [[Alexis Carrel|Carrel]]-[[Henry Dakin|Dakin]] method of wound treatment. 

His work influenced the future orthopedic practices of Lewis A. Sayre, Charles Fayette Taylor and Edward Hickling Bradford. He was a member of local medical societies of New York City and was an honorarily elected member of the then newly formed [[American Orthopedic Association]] in 1895. In addition, he may have once suggested to railroad engineers to elevate the outer rails of curved sections of rail lines. 

He was survived upon his death at age 89 by his wife of 40 years, Ellen W. Deering Davis.
