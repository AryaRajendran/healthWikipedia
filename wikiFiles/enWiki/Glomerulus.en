In the [[kidney]], a tubular structure called the [[nephron]] filters [[blood]] to form [[urine]]. At the beginning of the nephron, the '''glomerulus''' {{IPAc-en|ɡ|l|Q|ˈ|m|err|əl|ə|s}} is a network (tuft) of [[capillary|capillaries]] that performs the first step of filtering blood. 

The glomerulus is surrounded by [[Bowman's capsule]]. The blood is filtered through the capillaries of the glomerulus into the Bowman's capsule. The Bowman's capsule empties the filtrate into a tubule that is also part of the nephron. 

A glomerulus receives its blood supply from an [[afferent arteriole]] of the [[renal circulation]]. Unlike most other capillary beds, the glomerulus drains into an [[efferent arteriole]] rather than a [[venule]]. The resistance of these arterioles results in high pressure within the glomerulus, aiding the process of [[ultrafiltration (renal)|ultrafiltration]], where fluids and soluble materials in the blood are forced out of the capillaries and into [[Bowman's capsule]].

A glomerulus and its surrounding [[Bowman's capsule]] constitute a [[renal corpuscle]], the basic filtration unit of the kidney. The rate at which blood is filtered through all of the glomeruli, and thus the measure of the overall renal function, is the [[renal function|glomerular filtration rate]] (GFR).

==Afferent circulation==
The [[afferent arteriole]] that supplies the capillaries of a glomerulus branches off of an [[interlobular artery]] in the renal cortex. Glomerular capillary pressure, and thus glomerular filtration rate, can be influenced by constriction or relaxation of the afferent arteriole, resulting in decreases or increases in pressure. As an example, one study involving rats found that having narrowed afferent arterioles contributed to the development of increased blood pressure.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Norrelund |first1=H |last2=Christensen |first2=KL |year=1994 |title=Early narrowed afferent arteriole is a contributor to the development of hypertension |journal=Hypertension |volume=24 |pages=301–308 |publisher=Danish Biomembrane Research Centre |doi= |url=http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/24/3/301.short |accessdate=July 2011 }} </ref> [[Sympathetic nervous system]] action as well as hormones can also impact glomerular filtration rate by modulating afferent arteriole diameter.

==Layers==
If a substance has passed through the glomerular capillary endothelial cells, glomerular [[basement membrane]], and [[podocyte]]s, then it enters the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the tubule and is known as glomerular filtrate. Otherwise, it exits the glomerulus through the efferent arteriole and continues circulation as discussed below and as shown on the picture.

C. Podocytes: 1. enzymatic and structural protein 2. filtration slit 3. diaphragma]]
===Endothelial cells===
The [[endothelial cell]]s of the glomerulus contain numerous pores ([[Fenestra (histology)|fenestrae]]) that, unlike those of other fenestrated capillaries, are not spanned by diaphragms. The cells have fenestrations that are 70 to 100 nm in diameter. Since these pores are relatively large, they allow for the free filtration of fluid, plasma solutes and protein. However they are not large enough that red blood cells can be filtered.

===Glomerular basement membrane===
The glomerular endothelium sits on a very thick (250–350 [[nanometer|nm]]) [[glomerular basement membrane]].

===Podocytes===
[[Podocyte]]s line the other side of the glomerular basement membrane and form part of the lining of Bowman's space. Podocytes form a tight interdigitating network of ''foot processes'' (pedicels) that control the filtration of proteins from the capillary lumen into Bowman's space.  

The space between adjacent podocyte foot processes is spanned by a [[slit diaphragm]] formed by several proteins including [[podocin]] and [[nephrin]]. In addition, foot processes have a negatively charged coat ([[glycocalyx]]) that limits the filtration of negatively charged molecules, such as [[serum albumin]].

The podocytes are sometimes considered the "visceral layer of [[Bowman's capsule]]", rather than part of the glomerulus.

===Intraglomerular mesangial cell===
[[Intraglomerular mesangial cell]]s are found in the interstitium between endothelial cells of the glomerulus. They are not part of the filtration barrier but are specialized [[pericytes]] that participate indirectly in filtration by contracting and reducing the glomerular surface area, and therefore filtration rate, in response mainly to stretch.

==Selectivity== <!--Permselectivity redirects here-->
{{Seealso|Table of permselectivity for different substances}}
The structures of the layers determine their [[Vascular permeability|permeability]]-selectivity ''permselectivity''. The factors that influence permselectivity are the [[negative charge]] of the basement membrane and the podocytic epithelium, and the effective pore size of the glomerular wall (8&nbsp;nm). As a result, large and/or negatively charged molecules will pass through far less frequently than small and/or positively charged ones.<ref name=guyton11>{{Cite book | author=Guyton, Arthur C.; Hall, John E. | title=Textbook of Medical Physiology | year=2006 | publisher=Elsevier Saunders | location=Philadelphia | isbn=0-7216-0240-1 | pages=316–317}}</ref> For instance, small ions such as [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] pass freely, while larger proteins, such as [[hemoglobin]] and [[albumin]] have practically no permeability at all.

==Efferent circulation==
Blood is carried out of the glomerulus by an [[efferent arteriole|efferent]] ''[[efferent arteriole|arteriole]]'' instead of a ''[[venule]]'', as is observed in most other capillary systems. This provides tighter control over the bloodflow through the glomerulus, since arterioles can be dilated and constricted more readily than venules, owing to arterioles' larger [[smooth muscle]] layer ([[tunica media]]).

Efferent arterioles of [[juxtamedullary nephron]]s (i.e., the 15% of nephrons closest to the medulla) send straight capillary branches that deliver isotonic blood to the renal medulla. Along with the [[loop of Henle]], these [[vasa recta]] play a crucial role in the establishment of the nephron's [[countercurrent exchange]] system.

The [[efferent arteriole]], into which the glomerulus delivers blood, empties into an [[interlobular vein]].

==Juxtaglomerular cells==
The walls of the afferent arteriole contain specialized [[smooth muscle]] cells that synthesize [[renin]]. These [[juxtaglomerular cell]]s play a major role in the [[renin-angiotensin system]], which helps regulate [[blood volume]] and [[blood pressure|pressure]].
