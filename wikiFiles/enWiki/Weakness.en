'''Weakness''' is a symptom represented, medically, by a number of different conditions, including: lack of muscle strength, [[malaise]], [[dizziness]], or [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].<ref name=Rosen10>{{cite book |title=Rosen's Emergency Medicine: Concepts and Clinical Practice |edition=7th |last=Marx |first=John |year=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-323-05472-0 |page=Chapter 11 }}</ref> The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have true or perceived muscle weakness. True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including [[muscular dystrophy]] and [[inflammatory myopathy]]. It occurs in [[neuromuscular junction]] disorders, such as [[myasthenia gravis]].

==Diagnostic distinctions==
===True weakness vs. perceived weakness===

* '''True weakness''' (or '''neuromuscular''') describes a condition where the force exerted by the muscles is less than would be expected, for example [[muscular dystrophy]].

* '''Perceived weakness''' (or '''non-neuromuscular''') describes a condition where a person feels more effort than normal is required to exert a given amount of force but actual muscle strength is normal, for example [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Adams and Victor's Principles of Neurology, Ninth Edition | publisher=McGraw-Hill | author=Ropper, Allan H.; Samuels, Martin A. | authorlink=Chapter 24. Fatigue, Asthenia, Anxiety, and Depressive Reactions | year=2009 | isbn=978-0071499927}}</ref>

In some conditions, such as [[myasthenia gravis]], muscle strength is normal when resting, but ''true weakness'' occurs after the muscle has been subjected to exercise. This is also true for some cases of [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], where objective post-exertion muscle weakness with delayed recovery time has been measured and is a feature of some of the published definitions.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1468-1331.1999.610063.x |author=Paul L, Wood L, Behan WM, Maclaren WM |title=Demonstration of delayed recovery from fatiguing exercise in chronic fatigue syndrome |journal=Eur.

===Asthenia vs. myasthenia===
'''Asthenia''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''ἀσθένεια'', lit. ''lack of strength'' but also ''disease'') is a medical term referring to a condition in which the body lacks or has lost strength either as a whole or in any of its parts. It denotes symptoms of physical [[weakness (medical)|weakness]] and [[muscle weakness|loss of strength]]. General asthenia occurs in many chronic wasting diseases (such as anemia and cancer), sleep disorders or chronic disorders of the heart, lungs or kidneys, and is probably most marked in diseases of the adrenal gland. Asthenia may be limited to certain [[organs]] or systems of organs, as in [[asthenopia]], characterized by ready fatiguability. Asthenia is also a side effect of some medications and treatments, such as [[Ritonavir]] (a [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]] used in [[HIV]] treatment), vaccines such as the HPV vaccine [[Gardasil]]<ref name="Gardasil" >{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/cber/approvltr/gardasil061208L.htm

Differentiating psychogenic (perceived) asthenia and true asthenia from myasthenia is often difficult, and in time apparent psychogenic asthenia accompanying many chronic disorders is seen to progress into a primary weakness.

'''Myasthenia''' (my- from Greek μυο meaning "muscle" + -asthenia ἀσθένεια meaning "weakness"), or simply '''muscle weakness''', is a lack of muscle strength. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have either true or perceived muscle weakness. True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in [[neuromuscular disease]]s, such as myasthenia gravis.

==Differential diagnosis==
Muscle fatigue can be central, neuromuscular, or peripheral muscular. Central muscle fatigue manifests as an overall sense of energy deprivation, and peripheral muscle weakness manifests as a local, muscle-specific inability to do work.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gandevia SC, Enoka RM, McComas AJ, Stuart DG, Thomas CK |title=Neurobiology of muscle fatigue.

===Central fatigue===
The '''central fatigue''' is generally described in terms of a reduction in the [[nervous system|neural]] drive or nerve-based motor command to working muscles that results in a decline in the force output.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gandevia SC |title=Spinal and supraspinal factors in human muscle fatigue |journal=Physiol.

===Neuromuscular fatigue===
[[Nerve]]s control the contraction of muscles by determining the number, sequence, and force of muscular contraction. When a nerve experiences [[synaptic fatigue]] it becomes unable to stimulate the muscle that it innervates. Most movements require a force far below what a muscle could potentially generate, and barring [[pathology]], neuromuscular fatigue is seldom an issue.

For extremely powerful contractions that are close to the upper limit of a muscle's ability to generate force, '''neuromuscular fatigue''' can become a limiting factor in untrained individuals. In novice [[strength training|strength trainers]], the muscle's ability to generate force is most strongly limited by nerve’s ability to sustain a [[rate coding|high-frequency signal]]. After an extended period of maximum contraction, the nerve’s signal reduces in frequency and the force generated by the contraction diminishes. There is no sensation of pain or discomfort, the muscle appears to simply ‘stop listening’ and gradually cease to move, often [[Muscle contraction#Eccentric contraction|lengthening]]. As there is insufficient stress on the muscles and tendons, there will often be no [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] following the workout.  Part of the process of strength training is increasing the nerve's ability to generate sustained, high frequency signals which allow a muscle to contract with their greatest force.  It is this "neural training" that causes several weeks worth of rapid gains in strength, which level off once the nerve is generating maximum contractions and the muscle reaches its physiological limit. Past this point, training effects increase muscular strength through myofibrillar or sarcoplasmic [[Muscle hypertrophy#Strength training|hypertrophy]] and metabolic fatigue becomes the factor limiting contractile force.

===Peripheral muscle fatigue===
'''Peripheral muscle fatigue''' during physical work is considered{{By whom|date=April 2012}} an inability for the body to supply sufficient energy or other metabolites to the contracting muscles to meet the increased energy demand. This is the most common case of physical fatigue—affecting a national{{Where|date=April 2012}} average of 72% of adults in the work force in 2002. This causes contractile dysfunction that manifests in the eventual reduction or lack of ability of a single muscle or local group of muscles to do work. The insufficiency of energy, i.e. sub-optimal [[cellular respiration|aerobic metabolism]], generally results in the accumulation of [[lactic acid]] and other [[acid]]ic anaerobic metabolic by-products in the muscle, causing the stereotypical burning sensation of local muscle fatigue, though recent studies have indicated otherwise, actually finding that lactic acid is a source of energy.<ref name=robergs>{{cite journal | author = R. Robergs, F. Ghiasvand, D. Parker | title = Biochemistry of exercise-induced metabolic acidosis | journal = Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol | volume = 287 | issue = 3 | pages = R502–16 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1152/ajpregu.00114.2004 | pmid = 15308499}}</ref>

The fundamental difference between the peripheral and central theories of muscle fatigue is that the peripheral model of muscle fatigue assumes failure at one or more sites in the chain that initiates muscle contraction. Peripheral regulation  therefore depends on the localized metabolic chemical conditions of the local muscle affected, whereas the central model of muscle fatigue is an integrated mechanism that works to preserve the integrity of the system by initiating muscle fatigue through muscle derecruitment, based on collective feedback from the periphery, before cellular or organ failure occurs. Therefore the feedback that is read by this central regulator could include chemical and mechanical as well as cognitive cues. The significance of each of these factors will depend on the nature of the fatigue-inducing work that is being performed.

Though not universally used, "metabolic fatigue" is a common alternative term for peripheral muscle weakness, because of the reduction in contractile force due to the direct or indirect effects of the reduction of substrates or accumulation of metabolites within the [[muscle fiber|myocytes]]. This can occur through a simple lack of energy to fuel contraction, or through interference with the ability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to stimulate [[actin]] and [[myosin]] to contract.

===Lactic acid hypothesis===
It was once believed that [[lactic acid]] build-up was the cause of muscle fatigue.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sahlin K |title=Muscle fatigue and lactic acid accumulation |journal=Acta Physiol Scand Suppl |volume=556 |pages=83–91 |year=1986 |pmid=3471061 }}</ref>  The assumption was lactic acid had a "pickling" effect on muscles, inhibiting their ability to contract.  The impact of lactic acid on performance is now uncertain, it may assist or hinder muscle fatigue.  

Produced as a by-product of [[lactic acid fermentation|fermentation]], lactic acid can increase intracellular acidity of muscles.  This can lower the sensitivity of contractile apparatus to [[Calcium|calcium ions]] (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) but also has the effect of increasing [[cytoplasm]]ic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration through an inhibition of the [[sodium-calcium exchanger|chemical pump]] that [[Active transport|actively transports]] calcium out of the cell.  This counters inhibiting effects of [[Potassium|potassium ions]] (K<sup>+</sup>) on muscular action potentials.  Lactic acid also has a negating effect on the chloride ions in the muscles, reducing their inhibition of contraction and leaving K<sup>+</sup> as the only restricting influence on muscle contractions, though the effects of potassium are much less than if there were no lactic acid to remove the chloride ions.  Ultimately, it is uncertain if lactic acid reduces fatigue through increased intracellular calcium or increases fatigue through reduced sensitivity of contractile proteins to Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

==Pathophysiology==
{{main|muscle contraction}}
Muscle cells work by detecting a [[Action potential|flow]] of electrical impulses from the [[brain]], which signals them to [[Muscle contraction|contract]] through the release of [[calcium]] by the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]]. Fatigue (reduced ability to generate force) may occur due to the nerve, or within the muscle cells themselves. New research from scientists at Columbia University suggests that muscle fatigue is caused by calcium leaking out of the muscle cell. This makes less calcium available for the muscle cell. In addition, the Columbia researchers propose that an enzyme activated by this released calcium eats away at muscle fibers.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/12/health/research/12musc.html?_r=2&ref=science&oref=slogin&oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=Finding May Solve Riddle of Fatigue in Muscles | first=Gina | last=Kolata | date=February 12, 2008}}</ref>

[[Substrate (biochemistry)|Substrates]] within the muscle generally serve to power muscular contractions. They include molecules such as [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), [[glycogen]] and [[Phosphocreatine|creatine phosphate]]. ATP binds to the [[myosin]] head and causes the ‘ratchetting’ that results in contraction according to the [[Sliding filament mechanism|sliding filament model]]. Creatine phosphate stores energy so ATP can be rapidly regenerated within the muscle cells from [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ions, allowing for sustained powerful contractions that last between 5–7 seconds. Glycogen is the intramuscular storage form of [[glucose]], used to generate energy quickly once intramuscular creatine stores are exhausted, producing [[lactic acid]] as a metabolic byproduct. Contrary to common belief, lactic acid accumulation doesn't actually cause the burning sensation we feel when we exhaust our oxygen and oxidative metabolism, but in actuality, lactic acid in presence of oxygen recycles to produce pyruvate in the liver, which is known as the Cori cycle.

Substrates produce metabolic fatigue by being depleted during exercise, resulting in a lack of intracellular energy sources to fuel contractions. In essence, the muscle stops contracting because it lacks the energy to do so.
