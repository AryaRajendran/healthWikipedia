In [[anatomy]], the '''head''' of an animal is the [[Anatomical terms of location#Directional terms|rostral]] part (from [[anatomical]] position) that usually comprises the [[brain]], [[eye]]s, [[ear]]s, [[nose]] and [[mouth]] (all of which aid in various sensory functions, such as [[visual perception|sight]], [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[olfaction|smell]], and [[taste]]). Some very simple animals may not have a head, but many [[bilateria|bilaterally symmetric forms]] do. Heads develop in animals by an evolutionary trend known as [[cephalization]]. In bilaterally symmetrical animals, nerve tissues concentrate at the anterior region, forming structures responsible for information processing. Through [[biological evolution]], sense organs and feeding structures also concentrate into the anterior region, which collectively form the head.
