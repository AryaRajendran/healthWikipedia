A '''zoonosis''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|z|oʊ|.|ə|ˈ|n|oʊ|s|ɨ|s}}) (also spelled '''zoönosis''') is an [[infectious disease]] that is transmitted between species (sometimes by a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]) from  [[animal]]s other than [[human]]s to humans or from humans to other animals (the latter is sometimes called '''reverse zoonosis''' or [[anthroponosis]]). In '''direct zoonosis''' the agent needs only one host for completion of its life cycle, without a significant change during transmission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/medical_dictionary/zonal_zoster.html#zoonosis |title=Zoonosis |work=Medical Dictionary |accessdate=2013-01-30}}</ref>

In a [[systematic review]] of 1,415 pathogens known to infect humans, 61% were zoonotic.<ref>Taylor ''et al.'' 2001 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11516376 Risk factors for human disease emergence] Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B 356(1411):983-9.</ref> The emergence of a pathogen into a new [[host (biology)|host]] species is called ''disease invasion'' or "disease emergence".

The emerging interdisciplinary field of [[conservation medicine]], which integrates human and [[veterinary medicine]], and [[environmental science]]s, is largely concerned with zoonoses.

== Historical development of zoonotic diseases ==

Most human [[prehistory]] was spent as groups of [[hunter-gatherers]] usually with fewer than [[Dunbar's number|150 individuals]] that were not often in contact with other bands. Because of this, [[epidemic]] or [[pandemic]] diseases, which depend on a constant influx of humans who have not developed an [[immune response]], tended to burn out after their first run through a population. To survive, a biological pathogen had to be a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] infection, stay alive in the host for long periods, or have a non-human [[natural reservoir|reservoir]] in which to live while waiting for new hosts to pass by. In fact, for many 'human' diseases, the human is actually an accidental victim and a [[dead-end host]]. (This is the case with [[rabies]], [[anthrax disease|anthrax]], [[tularemia]], [[West Nile virus]], and many others). Thus, much of human development has been in relation to zoonotic, not epidemic, diseases.

Many modern diseases, even epidemic diseases, started out as zoonotic diseases. It is hard to be certain which diseases jumped from other animals to humans, but there is good evidence that [[measles]], [[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[HIV]], and [[diphtheria]] came to us this way. The [[common cold]], and [[tuberculosis]] may also have started in other species.

Zoonoses are of interest because they are often previously unrecognized diseases or have increased virulence in populations lacking immunity. The West Nile virus appeared in the [[United States]] in 1999 in the [[New York City]] area, and moved through the country in the summer of 2002, causing much distress. [[Bubonic plague]] is a zoonotic disease,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Meerburg BG, Singleton GR, Kijlstra A|title=Rodent-borne diseases and their risks for public health|journal=Crit Rev Microbiol|volume=35 |issue=3|year=2009 |pmid=19548807|doi=10.1080/10408410902989837|url=http://www.informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10408410902989837 |pages=221–70}}</ref> as are [[salmonella]], [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], and [[Lyme disease]].

The major factor contributing to the appearance of new zoonotic pathogens in human populations is increased contact between humans and wildlife (Daszak ''et al.''., 2001). This can be caused either by encroachment of human activity into wilderness areas or by movement of wild animals into areas of human activity. An example of this is the outbreak of [[henipavirus|Nipah virus]] in peninsular Malaysia in 1999, when [[intensive pig farming]] began on the habitat of infected fruit bats. Unidentified infection of the pigs amplified the force of infection, eventually transmitting the virus to farmers and causing 105 human deaths (Field ''et al.''., 2001).

Similarly, in recent times avian influenza and West Nile virus have spilled over into human populations probably due to interactions between the carrier host and domestic animals. Highly mobile animals such as bats and birds may present a greater risk of zoonotic transmission than other animals due to the ease with which they can move into areas of human habitation.

Diseases like [[malaria]], African [[schistosomiasis]], [[river blindness]], and [[elephantiasis]] are ''not'' zoonotic, even though they may be transmitted by insects or use intermediate hosts [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s, because they depend on the human host for part of their life-cycle.

== Partial list of outbreaks of zoonosis associated with fairs and petting zoos ==
{{globalize|date=December 2010}}
[[Outbreak]]s of zoonoses have been traced to human interaction with and exposure to animals at [[fair]]s, [[petting zoo]]s, and other settings. In 2005, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) issued an updated list of recommendations for preventing zoonosis transmission in public settings.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title= Compendium of Measures To Prevent Disease Associated with Animals in Public Settings, 2005:  National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, Inc. (NASPHV) |journal=MMWR |volume= 54 |issue= RR–4 |pages=inclusive page numbers |year=2005 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5404.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref> The recommendations, developed in conjunction with the [http://www.nasphv.org/ National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians], include educational responsibilities of venue operators, limiting public and animal contact, and animal care and management.

In 1988, a person became ill with [[swine influenza]] virus (swine flu) and died after visiting the display area of the pig barn at a [[Wisconsin]] county fair.  Three healthcare personnel treating the case patient also developed flu-like illness with laboratory evidence of swine influenza virus infection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wells, et al. |last2=Hopfensperger |first2=DJ |last3=Arden |first3=NH |last4=Harmon |first4=MW |last5=Davis |first5=JP |last6=Tipple |first6=MA |last7=Schonberger |first7=LB |title=Swine influenza virus infections.

In 1994, seven cases of ''E. coli'' O157:H7 infection were traced to a [[farm]] in [[Leicestershire]], [[United Kingdom]].  An [[epidemiological]] investigation into the outbreak revealed that the [[strain (biology)|strain]] of ''E. coli'' O157:H7 isolated from nine animals on the farm was indistinguishable from the strain isolated from human samples.  Investigators concluded that the most likely cause of this outbreak was direct human contact with animals.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shukla, et al. |title=''Escherichia coli'' O157 infection associated with a farm visitor center |journal=Communicable Disease Report |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=R86–R90 |pmid=7606276 |year=1995 |last2=Slack |first2=R |last3=George |first3=A |last4=Cheasty |first4=T |last5=Rowe |first5=B |last6=Scutter |first6=J}}</ref>

In 1995, 43 children who had visited a rural farm in [[Wales]] became ill with [[Cryptosporidiosis]]. ''Cryptosporidium'' was isolated from seven of the ill children.  An epidemiological investigation indicated that the source of the children's illness was contact with [[calf|calves]] at the farm.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Evans, M. R. and D. Gardner |title="Cryptosporidiosis" Outbreak Associated with an Educational Farm Holiday |journal=Commun Dis Rep CDR Rev. 29 |volume=6 |issue=4 |page=R67 |year=1996}}</ref>

Also in 1995, at least 13 children became ill with ''Cryptosporidiosis'' after visiting a farm in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]].  In a [[case-control|case-control study]], researchers compared the activities of the 13 ill children, or cases, to the activities of 52 out of 55 people who had visited the farm&nbsp;– the [[scientific control|controls]].  The study revealed that illness was [[statistical significance|significantly associated]] with playing in the sand in a picnic area beside a stream where animals had access.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sayers, et al. |title=Cryptosporidiosis in children who visited an open farm |journal=Commun Dis Rep CDR Rev. 13 |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=R140–4 |year=1996}}</ref>

In 1997, an ''E. coli'' O157:H7 outbreak was identified among one child who lived on an open farm and two children who visited the farm during school parties. Two of the three children developed [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]] (HUS). Isolates collected from the three children and from samples taken at the farm were indistinguishable, demonstrating evidence of the link between the farm and the children's illness.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Milne, et al. |title="Escherichia coli" O157 incident associated with a farm open to members of the public |journal= Communicable Disease and Public Health |pages=22–26 |year=1999 |volume=2 |pmid=10462890 |last2=Plom |first2=A |last3=Strudley |first3=I |last4=Pritchard |first4=GC |last5=Crooks |first5=R |last6=Hall |first6=M |last7=Duckworth |first7=G |last8=Seng |first8=C |last9=Susman |first9=MD |issue=1}}</ref>

In 1999, what is believed to be the largest outbreak of waterborne ''E. coli'' O157:H7 illness in [[United States]] history occurred at the [[Washington County, New York|Washington County]], [[New York]] fair.  The [[New York State Department of Health]] identified 781 individuals who were suspected of being infected with either ''E. coli'' O157:H7 or ''Campylobacter jejuni''. An investigation into the outbreak revealed that consumption of beverages purchased from vendors supplied with water drawn from an [[chlorinated|unchlorinated]] fairgrounds well was associated with illness. In all, 127 outbreak victims were confirmed ill with ''E. coli'' O157:H7 infections; 71 were hospitalized, 14 developed [[Hemolytic-uremic syndrome|HUS]], and two died.<ref>{{cite journal |author=New York State Department of Health and A.C. Novello |title=The Washington County Fair outbreak report |year=2000}}</ref>

In 2000, 51 people became ill with confirmed or suspected ''E. coli'' O157:H7 infections after visiting a [[dairy]] farm in [[Pennsylvania]]. Eight children developed [[Hemolytic-uremic syndrome|HUS]]. A case-control study among visitors to the dairy was conducted jointly by the CDC, [[Pennsylvania Department of Health]], and the [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]] Health Department. The study's authors concluded that ''E. coli'' was transmitted to visitors as a result of contamination on animal hides and in the environment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=Outbreaks of ''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7 infections among children associated with farm visits—Pennsylvania and Washington 2000 |journal=MMWR |volume=50 |issue=15 |pages=293–297 |year=2001 |url= http://www.cdc.gov/mmwR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5015a5.htm |pmid=11330497}}</ref>

Also in 2000, 43 visitors to the [[Medina County, Ohio|Medina County]] [[County fair|fair]] in [[Ohio]] were confirmed ill with ''E. coli'' O157:H7 infections. An investigation into the outbreak suggested that the water system from which food vendors were supplied was the source of the ''E. coli'' outbreak. Several months later, five children became ill with ''E. coli'' infections after attending a "Carnival of Horrors" event held at the Medina County fairgrounds. PFGE analysis of the strains of ''E. coli'' isolated from members of both outbreaks revealed an indistinguishable pattern, and investigators from the [http://www.medinahealth.org/ Medina County Health Department] and the CDC determined that the Medina County Fairgrounds water distribution system was the source of both ''E. coli'' outbreaks.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rickelman-Apisa, J.M. |title=Summary of ''E. coli'' O157:H7 Outbreak Associated with the Medina County Fairgrounds 2000 Fair and 2000 Carnival of Horrors |publisher=Medina County Health Department |date=2001-09-28}}</ref>

In 2001, an ''E. coli'' O157:H7 outbreak was traced to exposure in the Cow Palace at the [[Lorain County, Ohio|Lorain County]] Fair in Ohio. CDC investigators identified 23 cases of ''E. coli'' infection associated with attendance at the Lorain County Fair, with additional secondary cases likely. Two people developed [[Hemolytic-uremic syndrome|HUS]]. An investigation revealed ''E. coli'' contamination on doorways, rails, bleachers, and sawdust. Investigators concluded that the Lorain County Fair was the source of the outbreak.<ref name="lorain">{{cite journal |author= Varma, J.K. |title=Trip report epi-aid # 2001-84: Outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 infections associated with Lorain and Wyandot County fairs, Ohio, September–October 2002 From Jay K.

Department of Health and Human Services |date=2002-02-15}}</ref>

[[Wyandot County, Ohio|Wyandot County]], Ohio, also reported an ''E. coli'' O157:H7 outbreak in 2001. Ninety-two ''E. coli'' infections were reported to the Wyandot County Health Department and the CDC, with 27 cases confirmed using laboratory analysis. Two cases developed [[Hemolytic-uremic syndrome|HUS]]. Contact with infected cattle was believed to be the source of the outbreak; however, a specific cause was never identified.<ref name="lorain"/>

In 2002, seven people became ill with ''E. coli'' O157:H7 infections after visiting a large agricultural fair in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Outbreak investigators conducted a case-control study, which indicated that goats and sheep from a petting zoo were the source of the ''E. coli'' among fair visitors. Other indications were that the fencing and environment surrounding the petting zoo could have been a source of transmission.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Warshawsky, et al. |title=Outbreak of Escherichia coli 0157:H7 related to animal contact at a petting zoo |journal=Canadian Journal of Infectious Diseases |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=175–181 |pmid=18159389 |year=2002 |last2=Gutmanis |first2=I |last3=Henry |first3=B |last4=Dow |first4=J |last5=Reffle |first5=J |last6=Pollett |first6=G |last7=Ahmed |first7=R |last8=Aldom |first8=J |last9=Alves |first9=D |pmc=2094871}}</ref>

What is believed to be the largest ''E. coli'' O157:H7 outbreak in [[History of Oregon|Oregon history]] occurred among attendees at the [[Lane County, Oregon|Lane County]] fair in 2002.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oregon Department of Human Services |title=Hemorrhagic Escherichiosis from a County Fair |journal=CD Summary |volume=51 |issue=19 |date=2002-09-13 url=http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/ph/cdsumMarchy/2002/ohd5119.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>  An [[Oregon Department of Human Services]]&nbsp;– Health Services investigation led to the belief that the ''E. coli'' outbreak originated from exposure in the sheep and goat barn. In all, 79 people were confirmed ill with ''E. coli'' infections as part of the outbreak; 22 were hospitalized, and 12 suffered [[Hemolytic-uremic syndrome|HUS]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oregon Department of Human Services, Health Services |title=2005 Ways and Means Presentation – Phase 1 |publisher=Oregon Department of Human Services |year=2005 |url=http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/aboutdhs/budget/0507budget/w-m_ph_ph1_ov.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-05-22}}</ref>

In 2003, fair visitors and animal exhibitors at the [[Fort Bend, Texas|Fort Bend]] County Fair in Texas became ill with ''E. coli'' O157:H7 infections. An outbreak investigation led to the determination that 25 people had become ill with ''E. coli'' infections after attending the Fort Bend County Fair; seven people were laboratory-confirmed with ''E. coli'', and 5 developed [[Hemolytic-uremic syndrome|HUS]] or TTP ([[Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]]). Investigators isolated a strain of ''E. coli'' indistinguishable from the outbreak strain from four animal husbandry sites, and found high levels of ''E. coli'' contamination in both rodeo and animal exhibit areas.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Durso, L.M., et al. |title=Shiga-Toxigenic ''Escherichia coli'' (STEC) O157:H7 Infections Among Livestock Exhibitors and Visitors at a Texas County Fair |journal=Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases |volume=5 |pages=193–201 |year=2005 | doi = 10.1089/vbz.2005.5.193 |pmid=16011437 |issue=2}}</ref>

In 2004, a large ''E. coli'' O157:H7 outbreak occurred among visitors at the 2004 [[North Carolina State Fair]]. During its investigation into the outbreak, the [[North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services]] (NCDHHS) received over 180 reports of illness, and documented 33 culture-confirmed cases of ''E. coli'' O157:H7 associated with attendance at the fair, with 15 children developing [[Hemolytic-uremic syndrome|HUS]]. In its final investigation report, NCDHHS concluded that the North Carolina State Fair ''E. coli'' outbreak had originated at a petting zoo exhibit.  The conclusion was supported by a case-control study, environmental sampling, and laboratory analysis of samples collected from the fair and members of the outbreak.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Goode |first=B. |coauthors=O'Reilly, C. |title=Outbreak of Shiga toxin producing ''E. coli'' (STEC) infections associated with a petting zoo at the North Carolina State Fair – Raleigh, North Carolina, November 2004 Final Report |publisher=North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services |date=2005-06-29}}</ref>

In 2005, a petting zoo that exhibited at two [[Florida]] fairs and a festival was traced as the source of an ''E. coli'' O157:H7 outbreak. Sixty-three people who had visited either the [[Florida State Fair]], the Central Florida Fair, or the Florida Strawberry Festival reported illness to investigators for the [[Florida Department of Health]], including 20 who were culture-confirmed and 7 with [[Hemolytic-uremic syndrome|HUS]]. A case-control study revealed that illness was associated with exposure to a petting zoo exhibit present at all three events.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=Outbreaks of ''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7 Associated with Petting Zoos — North Carolina, Florida, and Arizona, 2004 and 2005 |journal=MMWR |volume=54| issue = = 50 |page=1279 |year=2005}}</ref>
