'''Orthoptics''' (from the Greek words ''ortho'' meaning "straight", and ''optikas'' meaning "vision" <ref>http://www.tcos.ca/about_orthoptics.html</ref>) is a discipline dealing with the diagnosis and treatment of defective eye movement and coordination (such as [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]]), [[binocular vision]], and [[amblyopia]] by [[eye care professional]]s.<ref name="Cassin">Cassin, B. and Solomon, S. ''Dictionary of Eye Terminology''. Gainsville, Florida: Triad Publishing Company, 1990.</ref> There are five areas of treatment for orthoptic problems: 
*[[corrective lens]]es ([[spherical]], [[cylindrical|cylindrical lens]], [[prism (optics)|prismatic]] and [[Fresnel lens]]es)
*[[Strabismus|strabismic-related]] orthoptics as an "eye exercise" is limited to the treatment of eye coordination problems by increasing the range of binocular fusion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
*[[eyepatch]]ing
*[[pharmaceutical]]s, such as [[cycloplegic]]s
*[[surgery]]

However the term ''orthoptics'' is sometimes used to refer simply to eye exercises which are a component of strabismic-related [[vision therapy]].

==Orthoptists==
Orthoptists are [[Eye care professional]]s who specialise in the diagnosis and management of binocular vision problems.<ref name="internationalorthoptics.org">http://www.internationalorthoptics.org/download/1160331924_3.1._pr_01_rev_06.doc</ref><ref>http://www.ranzco.edu/orthoptists-and-prescribing-in-nsw/view?searchterm=None</ref> Orthoptists are represented worldwide by the [[International Orthoptic Association]].

Orthoptics is usually studied as a primary or master's degree,<ref>http://www.latrobe.edu.au/orthoptics/</ref> or as a 2 to 4 years post graduate training course. Orthoptists usually work in close cooperation with [[Ophthalmologists]], [[Pediatrics|pediatricians]], and sometimes [[neurology|neurologists]]. Continuing professional development and registration is required in most countries.<ref>Koklanis K, Georgievski Z. Continuing professional education programs for orthoptists. Insight 2009; Feb/March: 43. [PDF]</ref>

==History==
Orthoptists and ophthalmologists introduced a wide variety of techniques for the improvement of binocular function in the 1930s. The first pioneer was Mary Maddox, the daughter of an English ophthalmologist.<ref name="Helveston">{{cite journal | last1 = Helveston | first1 = EM | title = Visual training: current status in ophthalmology | journal = American journal of ophthalmology | volume = 140 | issue = 5 | pages = 903–10 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16310470 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajo.2005.06.003 }}</ref>

The orthoptic health care profession evolved and specialised as scientific development increased in the diagnosis, management and pre/post-surgical care of patients with [[strabismus]],  binocular vision abnormalities and specific pediatric disorders.<ref name="Georgievski Z 2007">{{cite journal | last1 = Georgievski | first1 = Z | last2 = Koklanis | first2 = K | last3 = Leone | first3 = J | title = Orthoptists' management of amblyopia - a case-based survey. | journal = Strabismus | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 197–203 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18058356 | doi = 10.1080/09273970701631975 }}</ref><ref name="Koklanis 2008">{{cite journal | last1 = Koklanis | first1 = K | last2 = Georgievski | first2 = Z | title = Recurrence of intermittent exotropia: factors associated with surgical outcomes. | journal = Strabismus | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–40 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19301192 | doi = 10.1080/09273970802678750 }}</ref> Because of their lower prevalence and variational presentation, these were beyond the realm of a primary eyecare consultation at a spectacle shop (where most [[Optometrist]]s work) and beyond the [[Ophthalmologist]]s' demanding surgical workload and practice. Hence, Orthoptists began to specialize in hospitals with these problems throughout more than 20 countries.<ref name="Koklanis 2008" /><ref>http://www.internationalorthoptics.org/</ref>

==Current orthoptic practice==
Orthoptists are mainly involved with diagnosing and managing patients with binocular vision disorders which relate to [[amblyopia]], [[extraocular muscle]] balance such as with [[version (eye)|version]], [[refractive|refractive errors]], [[vergence]], accommodation imbalances, ([[positive relative accommodation]], [[negative relative accommodation]]) and [[pathological]] causes. They work closely with ophthalmologists to ensure that patients with eye muscle disorders are offered a full range of treatment options. According to the [[International Orthoptic Association]], professional orthoptic practice involves the following<ref name="internationalorthoptics.org"/>:
