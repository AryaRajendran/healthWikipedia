{{Flu}}
'''Human flu''' is a term used to refer to [[influenza]] cases caused by [[Orthomyxoviridae]] that are [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] to human populations (as opposed to infection relying upon [[zoonosis]]). It is an arbitrary categorization scheme, and is not associated with [[phylogenetics]]-based [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. Human flu-causing viruses can belong to any of three major influenza-causing Orthomyxoviruses — [[Influenzavirus A|Influenza A virus]], [[Influenzavirus B|Influenza B virus]] and [[Influenzavirus C|Influenza C virus]].

The annually updated [[trivalent]] [[influenza vaccine]] contains two [[hemagglutinin]] (HA) surface glycoprotein components from [[Influenzavirus A|Influenza A virus]] strains and one from [[Influenzavirus B|B influenza]].

Most human [[flu]] is a non-[[pandemic flu]] that is slightly different from the main human flus that existed in last year's [[flu season]] period. This type of flu is also called "common flu" or "seasonal flu" or "annual flu". It causes yearly flu [[epidemic]]s that are generally not deadly except to the very old or very young.

==Classification==
"Human influenza virus" usually refers to those subtypes that spread widely among humans. [[H1N1]], [[H1N2]], and [[H3N2]] are the only known Influenza A virus subtypes currently circulating among humans.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/facts.htm CDC] ''Key Facts About Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) and Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus''</ref>

Genetic factors in distinguishing between "human flu viruses" and "[[avian influenza]] viruses" include:
:'''PB2''': ([[RNA polymerase]]): [[Amino acid]] (or [[residue (chemistry)|residue]]) position 627 in the PB2 protein encoded by the PB2 [[RNA]] gene. Until [[H5N1]], all known avian influenza viruses had a [[Glutamic acid|Glu]] at position 627, while all human influenza viruses had a [[lysine]].
:'''HA''': ([[hemagglutinin]]): Avian influenza HA bind alpha 2-3 [[sialic acid]] receptors while human influenza HA bind alpha 2-6 sialic acid receptors. Swine influenza viruses have the ability to bind both types of sialic acid receptors.

"About 52 key genetic changes distinguish avian influenza strains from those that spread easily among people, according to researchers in Taiwan, who analyzed the genes of more than 400 A type flu viruses."<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&sid=a6S3ZQwqZkS4&refer=latin_america Bloomberg News] article '' Scientists Move Closer to Understanding Flu Virus Evolution'' published August 28, 2006</ref> "How many mutations would make an avian virus capable of infecting humans efficiently, or how many mutations would render an influenza virus a pandemic strain, is difficult to predict. We have examined sequences from the 1918 strain, which is the only pandemic influenza virus that could be entirely derived from avian strains. Of the 52 species-associated positions, 16 have residues typical for human strains; the others remained as avian signatures. The result supports the hypothesis that the 1918 pandemic virus is more closely related to the avian influenza A virus than are other human influenza viruses."<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no09/06-0276.htm CDC] Emerging Infectious Diseases Journal Volume 12, Number 9 – September 2006 - ''Genomic Signatures of Human versus Avian Influenza A Viruses article'' by Chen G-W, Chang S-C, Mok C-K, Lo Y-L, Kung Y-N, Huang J-H, et al. posted August 23, 2006</ref>

==Characteristics==
Human flu symptoms usually include [[fever]], [[cough]], [[sore throat]], [[myalgia|muscle aches]], [[conjunctivitis]] and, in severe cases, severe breathing problems and [[pneumonia]] that may be fatal.  The severity of the infection will depend to a large part on the state of the infected person's [[immune system]] and if the victim has been exposed to the strain before, and is therefore partially immune.

All of these symptoms are characteristic of numerous [[infectious agent]]s, so many that most diagnoses of human influenza technically are diagnoses of [[influenza-like illness]] (ILI) and most cases of ILI are not due to influenza.

==Impact==
{{globalize/US|date=December 2010}}
The annual human flu in the U.S. "results in approximately 36,000 deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalizations each year. In addition to this human toll, influenza is annually responsible for a total cost of over $10 billion in the U.S.".<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/pandemic-influenza.html whitehouse.gov] National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza -  Introduction - "Although remarkable advances have been made in science and medicine during the past century, we are constantly reminded that we live in a universe of microbes - viruses, bacteria, protozoa and fungi that are forever changing and adapting themselves to the human host and the defenses that humans create. Influenza viruses are notable for their resilience and adaptability. While science has been able to develop highly effective vaccines and treatments for many infectious diseases that threaten public health, acquiring these tools is an ongoing challenge with the influenza virus. Changes in the genetic makeup of the virus require us to develop new vaccines on an annual basis and forecast which strains are likely to predominate. As a result, and despite annual vaccinations, the U.S. faces a burden of influenza that results in approximately 36,000 deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalizations each year. In addition to this human toll, influenza is annually responsible for a total cost of over $10 billion in the U.S. A pandemic, or worldwide outbreak of a new influenza virus, could dwarf this impact by overwhelming our health and medical capabilities, potentially resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths, millions of hospitalizations, and hundreds of billions of dollars in direct and indirect costs. This Strategy will guide our preparedness and response activities to mitigate that impact."</ref>

According to the [[World Health Organization]]: "Every winter, tens of millions of people get the flu. Most are only ill and out of work for a week, yet the elderly are at a higher risk of death from the illness. We know the worldwide death toll exceeds a few hundred thousand people a year, but even in developed countries the numbers are uncertain, because medical authorities don't usually verify who actually died of influenza and who died of a flu-like illness."<ref>Peter M. Sandman and Jody Lanard [http://www.paho.org/English/DD/PIN/Number22_article1a.htm "Bird Flu: Communicating the Risk"] 2005 ''Perspectives in Health Magazine'' Vol. 10 issue 2.</ref>

==Known subtypes==
The Influenza A virus subtypes that have been confirmed in [[humans]], ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths, are:
*[[H1N1]] caused "[[Spanish Flu]]" and a [[reassortment]] caused [[2009 swine flu outbreak]]
*[[H2N2]] caused "Asian Flu"
*[[H3N2]] caused "Hong Kong Flu"
*[[H5N1]] "The Bird Flu" was the world's major [[influenza pandemic]] threat until the [[2009 swine flu outbreak|Swine Flu Pandemic of 2009]].
*[[H7N7]] has unusual [[zoonotic]] potential
*[[H1N2]] is currently endemic in humans and pigs
*[[H9N2]], [[H7N2]], [[H7N3]], [[H10N7]].

;H1N1
{{Main|H1N1}}
:[[H1N1]] is currently endemic in both human and pig populations. A variant of [[H1N1]] was responsible for the [[Spanish flu]] [[pandemic]] that killed some 50 million to 100 million people worldwide over about a year in 1918 and 1919.<ref>[http://www.nap.edu/books/0309095042/html/7.html NAP Books] National Academies Press Books - ''The Threat of Pandemic Influenza: Are We Ready? Workshop Summary (2005)'' - page 7.</ref> Controversy arose in October, 2005, after the H1N1 [[genome]] was published in the journal, [[Science (journal)|''Science'']]. Many fear that this information could be used for [[bioterrorism]].

:"When he compared the [[Spanish flu|1918 virus]] with today's human flu viruses, Dr. Taubenberger noticed that it had alterations in just 25 to 30 of the virus's 4,400 amino acids. Those few changes turned a bird virus into a killer that could spread from person to person." <ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/08/science/08flu.html?pagewanted=2 | work=The New York Times | first=Gina | last=Kolata | title=Hazard in Hunt for New Flu: Looking for Bugs in All the Wrong Places | date=November 8, 2005}}</ref>

;H2N2
{{Main|H2N2}}
:The [[Asian Flu]] was a [[pandemic]] outbreak of [[H2N2]] avian influenza that originated in [[China]] in 1957, spread worldwide that same year during which an [[influenza vaccine]] was developed, lasted until 1958 and caused between one and four million deaths.

;H3N2
{{Main|H3N2}}
:[[H3N2]] is currently endemic in both human and pig populations. It evolved from [[H2N2]] by [[antigenic shift]] and caused the [[Hong Kong Flu]] pandemic of 1968 and 1969 that killed up to 750,000.<ref>Detailed chart of its evolution [http://www.eletrica.ufsj.edu.br/~nepomuceno/references/epidemiology/ear_eal02.pdf here] at PDF called ''Ecology and Evolution of the Flu''</ref> "An early-onset, severe form of influenza A [[H3N2]] made headlines when it claimed the lives of several children in the United States in late 2003." <ref>[http://www.nap.edu/books/0309095042/html/115.html NAP Books] National Academies Press Books - ''The Threat of Pandemic Influenza: Are We Ready? Workshop Summary (2005)'' - page 115 - "There is particular pressure to recognize and heed the lessons of past influenza pandemics in the shadow of the worrisome 2003–2004 flu season. An early-onset, severe form of influenza A [[H3N2]] made headlines when it claimed the lives of several children in the United States in late 2003. As a result, stronger than usual demand for annual flu inactivated vaccine outstripped the vaccine supply, of which 10 to 20 percent typically goes unused. Because statistics on pediatric flu deaths had not been collected previously, it is unknown if the 2003–2004 season witnessed a significant change in mortality patterns."</ref>

:The dominant strain of annual flu in January 2006 is [[H3N2]]. Measured resistance to the standard antiviral drugs [[amantadine]] and [[rimantadine]] in H3N2 has increased from 1% in 1994 to 12% in 2003 to 91% in 2005.<ref>[http://www.reason.com/rb/rb101905.shtml Reason] {{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/15/health/15drugs.html | work=The New York Times | first=Lawrence K. | last=Altman | title=This Season's Flu Virus Is Resistant to 2 Standard Drugs | date=January 15, 2006}}</ref>

;H5N1
{{Main|H5N1}}
:[[H5N1]] was the world's major [[influenza pandemic]] threat until the Swine Flu Epidemic of 2009--a new strain of H1N1.

;H7N7
{{Main|H7N7}}
:[[H7N7]] has unusual zoonotic potential. In 2003 in [[Netherlands]] 89 people were confirmed to have H7N7 influenza virus infection following an outbreak in poultry on several farms. One death was recorded.

;H1N2
{{Main|H1N2}}
:[[H1N2]] is currently endemic in both human and pig populations. The new [[H1N2]] strain appears to have resulted from the reassortment of the genes of the currently circulating influenza [[H1N1]] and [[H3N2]] subtypes. The [[hemagglutinin]] protein of the [[H1N2]] virus is similar to that of the currently circulating [[H1N1]] viruses and the [[neuraminidase]] protein is similar to that of the current [[H3N2]] viruses.

;H9N2
{{Main|H9N2}}
:Low pathogenic avian influenza A ([[H9N2]]) infection was confirmed in 1999, in [[China]] and [[Hong Kong]] in two children, and in 2003 in [[Hong Kong]] in one child.

;H7N3
{{Main|H7N3}}
:In [[North America]], the presence of avian influenza strain [[H7N3]] was confirmed at several poultry farms in [[British Columbia]] in February 2004.  As of April 2004, 18 farms had been quarantined to halt the spread of the virus.  Two cases of humans with avian influenza have been confirmed in that region. "Symptoms included [[conjunctivitis]] and mild [[influenza]]-like illness." <ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no12/04-0961.htm CDC detailed analysis] ''Human Illness from Avian Influenza H7N3, British Columbia''</ref> Both fully recovered.
