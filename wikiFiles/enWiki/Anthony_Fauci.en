'''Anthony Stephen Fauci''' (born December 24, 1940) is an [[Immunology|immunologist]] who has made substantial contributions to research in the areas of [[HIV/AIDS]] and other immunodeficiencies, both as a scientist and as the head of the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] ([[NIAID]]).

==Education and career==
Anthony Stephen Fauci was born on December 24, 1940, in Brooklyn, New York, to Stephen A. Fauci, a [[pharmacist]], and Eugenia A. Fauci, a [[homemaker]].<ref name="Internet FAQ">Anthony S. Fauci [http://www.faqs.org/health/bios/20/Anthony-S-Fauci.html Biography ] Retrieved on May 30, 2007</ref> He graduated from  [[Regis High School (New York City)|Regis High School]] in [[New York City]]. He went on to attend the [[College of the Holy Cross]] and received his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from [[Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University|Cornell University Medical College]] in 1966. He then completed an internship and [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] at The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.<ref name="NIAID">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/about/directors/biography/ Biography] Retrieved on May 30, 2007</ref>

In 1968, he came to the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) as a clinical associate in the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation (LCI) in NIAID. In 1974, he became Head of the Clinical Physiology Section, LCI, and in 1980 was appointed Chief of the Laboratory of Immunoregulation, a position he still holds. In 1984, he became Director of [[NIAID]], which has the responsibility for  an extensive research portfolio of basic and applied research on infectious and immune-mediated illnesses.

==Medical achievements==
Fauci has made a number of basic scientific observations that contribute to the current understanding of the regulation of the human immune response, and is recognized for delineating the mechanisms whereby [[Immunosuppression|immunosuppressive]] agents adapt to the human immune response. He has developed therapies for formerly fatal diseases such as [[polyarteritis nodosa]], [[Wegener's granulomatosis]], and [[lymphomatoid granulomatosis]]. In a 1985 [[Stanford University]] Arthritis Center Survey of the American Rheumatism Association membership ranked the work of Fauci on the treatment of [[polyarteritis nodosa]] and [[Wegener's granulomatosis]] as one of the most important advances in patient management in [[rheumatology]] over the previous 20 years.<ref name="Holy Cross">Holy Cross Magazine [http://www.holycross.edu/departments/publicaffairs/hcm/summer02/features/fauci_sidebar.html Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., â€™62] Retrieved on May 30, 2007</ref>

Fauci has made influential contributions to the understanding of how [[HIV]] destroys the body's defenses leading to the progression to [[AIDS]]. He also has outlined the mechanisms of induction of [[HIV]] expression by endogenous [[cytokine]]s. Fauci has played an important role in developing strategies for the therapy and immune reconstitution of patients with this disease, as well as for a [[vaccine]] to prevent HIV infection. His current research is concentrated on identifying the nature of the immunopathogenic mechanisms of HIV infection and the scope of the body's immune responses to HIV. 

In 2003, the [[Institute for Scientific Information]]   indicated that Fauci was the 13th most-cited scientist during the twenty year period from 1983 to 2002.<ref>Science Watch [http://www.sciencewatch.com/sept-oct2003/sw_sept-oct2003_page1.htm Twenty Years of Citation Superstars] Retrieved on May 30, 2007</ref> He was the ninth most-cited scientist in  immunology in the period   January 1993 to June 30, 2003.<ref name="NIAID">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/about/directors/biography/ Biography] Retrieved on May 30, 2007</ref> 

==Memberships==
Fauci is a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[Institute of Medicine]] (Council Member), the [[American Philosophical Society]], and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]], as well as other numerous professional societies including the [[American Society for Clinical Investigation]], the [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]], and the [[American Association of Immunologists]]. He serves on the editorial boards of many scientific journals; as an editor of [[Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine]]; and as author, coauthor, or editor of more than 1,000 scientific publications, including several textbooks.<ref name="Cited">Highly Cited [http://hcr3.isiknowledge.com/author.cgi?id=366&cb=7149 Biography] Retrieved May 30, 2007</ref>
