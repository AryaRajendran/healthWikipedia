'''Chitosan''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|aɪ|t|ɵ|s|æ|n}}) is a linear [[polysaccharide]] composed of randomly distributed β-(1-4)-linked [[D-glucosamine]] (deacetylated unit) and [[N-Acetylglucosamine|N-acetyl-D-glucosamine]] (acetylated unit). It is made by treating shrimp and other crustacean shells with the alkali sodium hydroxide.

Chitosan has a number of commercial and possible biomedical uses. It can be used in agriculture as a seed treatment and biopesticide, helping plants to fight off fungal infections. In winemaking it can be used as a fining agent, also helping to prevent spoilage. In industry, it can be used in a self-healing polyurethane paint coating. In medicine, it may be useful in bandages to reduce bleeding and as an antibacterial agent; it can also be used to help deliver drugs through the skin.

More controversially, chitosan has been asserted to have use in limiting fat absorption, which would make it useful for dieting, but there is evidence against this.

Other uses of chitosan that have been researched include use as a soluble dietary fiber.

Chitosan is produced commercially by [[acetylation|deacetylation]] of [[chitin]], which is the structural [[wiktionary:element|element]] in the [[exoskeleton]] of [[crustaceans]] (such as crabs and shrimp) and cell walls of [[fungi]]. The degree of deacetylation (%DD) can be determined by NMR [[spectroscopy]], and the %DD in commercial chitosans ranges from 60 to 100%. On average, the molecular weight of commercially produced chitosan is between 3800 and 20,000 [[Atomic mass unit|Daltons]].  A common method for the synthesis of chitosan is the deacetylation of chitin using sodium hydroxide in excess as a reagent and water as a solvent.  This reaction pathway, when allowed to go to completion (complete deacetylation) yields up to 98% product.<ref>{{cite journal

The [[amino]] group in chitosan has a [[pKa]] value of ~6.5, which leads to a protonation in acidic to neutral solution with a charge density dependent on pH and the %DA-value. This makes chitosan water soluble and a bioadhesive which readily binds to negatively charged surfaces such as mucosal membranes. Chitosan enhances the transport of polar [[medication|drugs]] across epithelial surfaces, and is [[Biocompatibility|biocompatible]] and [[biodegradable]]. It is not aproved by FDA for drug delivery though. Purified quantities of chitosans are available for [[biomedical]] applications.

Chitosan and its derivatives, such as [[trimethylchitosan]] (where the amino group has been trimethylated), have been used in nonviral gene delivery. Trimethylchitosan, or quaternised chitosan, has been shown to [[Transfection|transfect]] breast cancer cells, with increased degree of trimethylation increasing the cytotoxicity; at approximately 50% trimethylation, the derivative is the most efficient at gene delivery. Oligomeric derivatives (3-6 kDa) are relatively nontoxic and have good gene delivery properties.<!--

==Usage==

=== Agricultural and horticultural use===

====Natural biocontrol and elicitor====
In [[agriculture]], chitosan is used primarily as a natural seed treatment and plant growth enhancer, and as an ecologically friendly [[biopesticide]] substance that boosts the innate ability of plants to defend themselves against fungal infections.<ref>{{cite web | title=Linden, J., Stoner, R., Knutson, K.

It is one of the most abundant biodegradable materials in the world. 

Degraded molecules of chitin/chitosan exist in soil and water. Chitosan applications for plants and crops are regulated by the EPA, and the USDA [[National Organic Program]] regulates its use on organic certified farms and crops.<ref>{{cite web |title= USDA NOP and EPA Rule on Chitosan, ''Federal Register/Vol. 72, No. 236/Monday, December 10, 2007/Rules and Regulation''|url=http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:YOkqBxU7-D0J:edocket.access.gpo.gov/2007/pdf/E7-23831.pdf+chitosan+EPA&cd=10&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us}}</ref> EPA-approved, biodegradable chitosan products are allowed for use outdoors and indoors on plants and crops grown commercially and by consumers.<ref>{{cite web | title=Chitin and Chitosan Final Registration Review Decision, Document ID:  EPA-HQ-OPP-2007-0566-0019,  Dec 11, 2008, pp 10–15, Regulations.gov |url=http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OPP-2007-0566-0019}}</ref>

===Water filtration===
Chitosan can also be used in water processing engineering as a part of a filtration process. Chitosan causes the fine sediment particles to bind together, and is subsequently removed with the sediment during sand filtration. It also removes phosphorus, heavy minerals, and oils from the water.
Chitosan is an important additive in the filtration process. Sand filtration apparently can remove up to 50% of the [[turbidity]] alone, while the chitosan with sand filtration removes up to 99% [[turbidity]].<ref>{{cite web | author = Alan Woodmansey (Highway Engineer) | title=Chitosan Treatment of Sediment Laden Water - Washington State I-90 Issaquah Project | url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/engineering/geotech/policymemo/tanks.cfm | month=March 19 | year=2002 | work = Federal Highway Administration | publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation | accessdate=2006-07-10}}</ref> Chitosan has been used to precipitate caseins from bovine milk and cheese making.

Chitosan is also useful in other filtration situations, where one may need to remove suspended particles from a liquid. In combination with [[bentonite]], [[gelatin]], [[silica gel]], [[isinglass]], or other [[fining agents (wine)|fining agents]], it is used to [[clarify (wine)|clarify]] [[wine]], [[mead]], and [[beer]]. Added late in the brewing process, chitosan improves [[flocculation]], and removes yeast cells, fruit particles, and other detritus that cause hazy wine. Chitosan combined with [[colloid]]al [[silica]] is becoming a popular fining agent for white wines, because chitosan does not require acidic [[tannin]]s (found primarily in red wines) with which to flocculate.<ref>{{cite web

===Winemaking & fungal source chitosan===
Chitosan has a long history for use as a fining agent in winemaking.  Fungal source Chitosan has shown an increase in settling activity, reduction of oxidized polyphenolics in juice and wine as well as the chelation and removal of copper (post-racking). 
Fungal-source Chitosan can also be used in winemaking for the control of the spoilage [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] Brettanomyces. These products and uses are approved for European use by the EU and [[OIV]] standards.

===Potential industrial use===
Scientists have recently developed a [[polyurethane]] coating that heals its own scratches when exposed to sunlight, offering the promise of scratch-free cars and other products. The self-healing coating uses chitosan incorporated into traditional polymer materials, such as those used in coatings on cars, to protect paint. When a scratch damages the chemical structure, the chitosan responds to ultraviolet light by forming chemical chains that begin bonding with other materials in the substance, eventually smoothing the scratch. The process can take less than an hour.<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;323/5920/1458?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=chitosan&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&resourcetype=HWCIT Self-Repairing Oxetane-Substituted Chitosan Polyurethane Networks]</ref>

Marek W. Urban, a scientist working on this project, said the polymer can only repair itself in the same spot once, and would not work after repeated scratches.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE52B6KI20090313 Coating makes scratches on cars disappear]</ref> Whether this technology can be applied to industrial materials, however, depends on a number of factors (long-term persistence of "healability", stiffness and heat resistance of coating, knowledge of the exact mechanism of healing, etc.) not present initial studies; further investigation into these factors can potentially take decades to rectify.

===Biomedical uses===
Chitosan's properties allow it to rapidly clot blood, and has recently gained approval in the United States and Europe for use in bandages and other [[Antihemorrhagic|hemostatic agents]]. Chitosan hemostatic products have been shown in testing by the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] to quickly stop bleeding and to reduce blood loss, and result in 100% survival of otherwise lethal arterial wounds in swine.<ref>{{cite journal | journal=Journal of Emergency Medicine | year=2008 | month=January | pages=74–81 | title = }}</ref>  Chitosan hemostatic products reduce blood loss in comparison to gauze dressings and increase patient survival.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Effect of a chitosan-based hemostatic dressing on blood loss and survival in a model of severe venous hemorrhage and hepatic injury in swine | journal=Journal of Trauma |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=177–182 |year=2003 |author=Pusateri, A.

Chitosan hemostatic agents are often chitosan salts made from mixing chitosan with an organic acid (such as succinic or lactic acid).<ref name="US patent1">{{US patent reference|number = 8106030| y=2012|m=01|d=31|inventor= Craig Hardy, Lee Johnson & Paul Luksch|title=Hemostatic Material }}</ref> The hemostatic agent works by an interaction between the cell membrane of erythrocytes (negative charge) and the protonated chitosan (positive charge) leading to involvement of platelets and rapid thrombus formation.<ref name="How Chitosan Works">{{cite journal | title=The safety of chitosan as a pharmaceutical excipient | journal=[[Regul Toxicol Pharmacol]] | volume=56 | issue=3 | pages=290–299 | year=2009 |author=Baldrick P.}}</ref> The chitosan salts can be mixed with other materials to make them more absorbent (such as mixing with alginate),<ref>{{US patent reference | number =  5836970| y=1998 | m=11 | d=17 |inventor= Abhay S. Pandit | title= Hemostatic Wound Dressing }}</ref> or to vary the rate of solubility and bioabsorbability of the chitosan salt.<ref name=" US patent1" /> The chitosan salts are biocompatible and biodegradable making them useful as absorbable haemostats. The protonated chitosan is broken down by lysozyme in the body to glucosamine <ref name="How Chitosan Works" /> and the conjugate base of the acid (such as lactate or succinate) are substances naturally found in the body. The chitosan salt may be placed on an absorbable backing.<ref>{{US patent application | number =  2011052665| y=2011 | m=03 | d=03 |inventor= Craig Hardy, Andrew Darby & Guy Eason | title= Hemostatic Material}}</ref> The absorbable backing may be synthetic (for instance made from existing absorbable suture materials e.g. Tephaflex polymer) or natural (e.g. cellulose or gelled/solidified honey).

Chitosan's properties also allow it to be used in transdermal drug delivery; it is mucoadhesive in nature, reactive (so it can be produced in many different forms), and most importantly, has a positive charge under acidic conditions. This positive charge comes from protonation of its free amino groups.  Lack of a positive charge means chitosan is insoluble in neutral and basic environments.  However, in acidic environments,  protonation of the amino groups leads to an increase in solubility. The implications of this are very important to biomedical applications. This molecule will maintain its structure in a neutral environment, but will solubilize and degrade in an acidic environment.  This means  chitosan can be used to transport a drug to an acidic environment, where the chitosan packaging will then degrade, releasing the drug to the desired environment.  One example of this drug delivery has been the transport of insulin.<ref>{{cite journal

===Preliminary research and FDA review===
Supposed to limit fat absorption in the body, chitosan may be sold in tablet form as a "fat binder". In one preliminary study, a 1% decrease in [[body mass index]] was seen with supplementation of chitosan over 8 weeks.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Schiller RN, Barrager E, Schauss AG, Nichols EJ.| title=A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study Examining the Effects of a Rapidly Soluble Chitosan Dietary Supplement on Weight Loss and Body Composition in Overweight and Mildly Obese Individuals | journal= J Am Nutraceutical Assoc |volume=4| issue=1|pages=42–9| year=2001 |url=http://www.ana-jana.org/Journal/journals/JANAVol41.pdf}}</ref>

However, in a Cochrane [[meta-analysis]],<ref name="cochrane">{{cite journal | author=Jull AB, Ni Mhurchu C, Bennett DA, Dunshea-Mooij CAE, Rodgers A | title=Chitosan for overweight or obesity | journal= Cochrane Database Syst Rev | issue=3 | year=2008 |pmid=18646097}}</ref> which evaluated clinical trials performed with dietary chitosan over a minimum of four weeks, body weight, blood pressure and parameters related to cholesterol were changed only in some low-quality trials, indicating a minor effect on body weight. Other higher quality trials indicated no significant effect of chitosan and no clinical justification for advising overweight patients to take chitosan supplements.<ref name="cochrane"/> 

In an experimental model of the [[digestive tract]], chitosan was shown to interact with oil, which inhibited duodenal absorption and enhanced lipid excretion.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Rodríguez MS, Albertengo LE.| title=Interaction between chitosan and oil under stomach and duodenal digestive chemical conditions | journal= Biosci Biotechnol Biochem |volume=69|issue=11|pages=2057–62| year=2005 | pmid=16306685|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bbb/69/11/69_11_2057/_pdf}}</ref> However, the mechanism of interaction between chitosan and fat is not well understood and has not been proved clinically.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Matthew D. Gades and Judith S. Stern | title=Chitosan supplementation and fecal fat excretion in men | journal=Obesity | year=2003 | publisher=Obesity Society | url=http://www.obesityresearch.org/cgi/content/abstract/11/5/683?etoc | accessdate=2008-02-18}}</ref> In mice, dietary ingestion of chitosan did not depress the level of iron, zinc or copper.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Zeng L, Qin C, He G, Wang W, Li W, Xu D.| title=Effect of dietary chitosans on trace iron, copper and zinc in mice | journal= Carbohydrate Polymers |volume=74 |issue=2| pages=279–282| year=2008 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014486170800091X}}</ref>

The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has issued [[FDA Warning Letter|warning letter]]s to supplement retailers who made inappropriate claims about the supposed health benefits of using chitosan.<ref>{{cite web | title=FDA Warning Letter for Chitosan Weight Loss Products|url=http://google2.fda.gov/search?q=warning+letter+chitosan&client=FDAgov&site=FDAgov&lr=&proxystylesheet=FDAgov&output=xml_no_dtd&getfields=*&ie=UTF-8&ip=194.78.203.60&access=p&sort=date%3AD%3AL%3Ad1&entqr=3&oe=UTF-8&ud=1&start=0}}</ref>

Chitosan is under research for several potential clinical applications:<ref>{{cite journal | author = Knorr, D. | title = Recovery and utilization of chitin and chitosan in food processing waste management | journal = Food Technology | volume = 45 | issue = 1 | pages = 114–122 | date = January 1991}}</ref>

* As a soluble [[dietary fiber]], it increases [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] viscosity and slows down the emptying of the stomach.
* It alters [[bile acid]] composition, increasing the [[excretion]] of [[sterol]]s and reducing the digestibility of [[Ileum|ileal]] fats.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fukada, Y.; Kimura, K.; Ayaki, Y. | title = Effect of chitosan feeding on intestinal bile acid metabolism in rats | journal = Lipids | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 395–399 | year = 1991 | publisher = Springer Berlin / Heidelberg| issn = 0024-4201 (Print) | pmid = 1895888 | doi = 10.1007/BF02537206 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/p08107u75814t787/ | unused_data = DUPLICATE DATA: issn = 1558-9307 (Online)}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1271/bbb.57.1439 | author = Maezaki, Y.; Tsuji, K.; Nakagawa, Y.; Kawai, Y.; Akimoto, M., et al | title = Hypocholesterolemic effect of chitosan in adult males | journal = Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry | volume = 57 | issue = 9 | pages = 1439–1444 | year = 1993 | issn = 09168451}}</ref><ref name="Razdan">{{cite journal | author = Razdan A., Pettersson D. | title = Effect of chitin and chitosan on nutrient digestibility and plasma lipid concentrations in broiler chickens | journal = British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 74 | pages = 277–288 | year = 1994 | doi = 10.1079/BJN19940029 | pmid=7947645 | issue = 2}}</ref> It is unclear how chitosan does this, but the currently favored hypotheses involve the increase of intestinal viscosity or [[bile]] acid-binding capacity.<ref name="Furda">{{cite journal | author=I.

* Chitosan is relatively insoluble in water, but can be dissolved by dilute acids, which would make it a highly-viscous dietary fiber.<ref name="Furda"/> Such fibers might inhibit the uptake of dietary [[lipids]] by increasing the thickness of the boundary layer of the intestinal [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]], which has been observed in animal experiments.<ref name="Ikeda">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jf00027a016 | author = Ikeda, I.; Sugano, M.; Yoshida, K.; Sasaki, E.; Iwamoto, Y.; Hatano, K. | title = Effects of chitosan hydrolysates on lipid absorption and on serum and liver lipid concentration in rats | journal = Agriculture and Food Chemistry | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 431–435 | date = March 1993 | issn = 0021-8561}}</ref>
* Having very few acetyl groups, chitosan contains [[cation]]ic groups. This may cause chitosan to have bile acid-binding capacity, which causes mixed [[micelle]]s to be entrapped or disintegrated in the [[duodenum]] and [[ileum]].<ref name="Furda"/> This would interrupt bile acid circulation, causing reduced lipid absorption and increased sterol excretion, which has also been observed in animal experiments.<ref name="Razdan"/><ref name="Furda"/><ref name="Ikeda"/>
