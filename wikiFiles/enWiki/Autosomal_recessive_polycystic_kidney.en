[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right| ARPKD is inherited in an [[Recessive gene|autosomal recessive]] pattern.]]
The recessive form of [[polycystic kidney]], called ARPKD ('''autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease''') is less common than [[autosomal dominant polycystic kidney]].

Mutations in the ''[[PKHD1]]'' (chromosomal locus 6p12.2) cause ARPKD.<ref name="pmid15706593">{{cite journal |author=Bergmann C, Küpper F, Dornia C, Schneider F, Senderek J, Zerres K |title=Algorithm for efficient PKHD1 mutation screening in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) |journal=Hum.

==Clinical Features==
The clinical presentation of ARPKD is highly variable. Up to 50% of affected neonates die of [[pulmonary hypoplasia]], the result of [[oligohydramnios]] from severe [[intrauterine]] [[kidney disease]]. About 80% of those who survive the neonatal period are still alive after 10 years; however, one-third of them will have developed [[Chronic kidney disease|ESRD]]. Enlarged kidneys may be detected soon after birth as [[wiktionary:bilateral|bilateral]] abdominal masses. Impaired urinary concentrating ability and [[metabolic acidosis]] ensue as [[Kidney tubules#Renal tubule|tubular]] function deteriorates. [[Hypertension]] often occurs in the first few years of life. Kidney function deteriorates progressively from childhood into early adult life. Longer-term survivors frequently develop [[portal hypertension]], [[esophageal varices]], and [[hypersplenism]] from [[periportal fibrosis]].

Risk factors for progressive kidney disease include younger age at diagnosis, black race, male gender, presence of [[PKD1|polycystin-1]] mutation, and hypertension.
General presenting [[symptoms]] and [[medical sign|signs]] include [[abdominal discomfort]], [[hematuria]], [[urinary tract infection]], incidental discovery of [[hypertension]], [[abdominal mass]], elevated [[blood serum|serum]] [[creatinine]], or cystic kidneys on imaging studies, patients usually have renal [[pain]], and develop [[renal insufficiency]].

ARPKD-Specific:
The classic presentation for ARPKD is systemic hypertension with progression to [[end-stage renal disease]] (ESRD) by the age of 15. In atypical presentation, a small number of ARPKD sufferers live to adulthood with some kidney function; but with significant deterioration in liver function.<ref name="Bisceglia 2006 26–56">{{cite journal|last=Bisceglia|first=M|coauthors=et al|title=Renal cystic diseases: a review|journal=Advanced Anatomic Pathology|year=2006|issue=13|pages=26–56}}</ref> This outcome is postulated to result from expression of the polycystic kidney and hepatic disease gene PKHD1, which is located on chromosome 6p.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sweeney|first=WE|coauthors=Avner ED|title=Molecular and cellular pathophysiology of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPDK)|journal=Cell Tissue Research|year=2006|issue=326|pages=671–685}}</ref>

ADPKD-Specific:
ADPKD is associated with pathologies in other body systems, in contrast to ARPKD.<ref name="Bisceglia 2006 26–56"/> In 50% of the cases cysts appear in other abdominal organs in including the liver, pancreas, spleen, lung, seminal vesicles, and ovaries. 10 to 30% have Berry aneurysms in the Circle of Willis cerebral circulation. The most common sites for cysts include the coronary arteries; and abnormalities in cardiac valves, hernias, and diverticuli are all documented.<ref name="Bisceglia 2006 26–56"/>

Clinical Course:
Approximately 50% of patients with ADPKD have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) by the age of 60, but those with ADPKD-2 tend to have later onset and slower progression. [[Hypertension]] is common, and often precedes renal dysfunction. Abdominal [[pain]] and early [[satiety]] and [[gastroesophageal reflux]] symptoms are common, due to the mass effect of the enlarged kidneys. Cyst rupture or [[hemorrhage]] into a cyst may produce acute pain or symptoms and signs of localized [[peritonitis]]. [[Hematuria]] may result from cyst rupture into the collecting system, or from [[uric acid]] or [[calcium oxalate]] [[kidney stones]]. [[Nephrolithiasis]] occurs in about 20% of patients.

Urinary tract infection occurs with increased frequency in [[ADPKD]]. Infection in a kidney or liver cyst is a particularly serious complication. It is most often due to [[Gram-negative bacteria]], and presents with [[pain]], [[fever]], and [[chills]]. [[Blood culture]]s are frequently [[Positive test|positive]], but [[urine culture]] may be negative, because infected kidney cysts do not communicate directly with the [[collecting duct system]]. Distinguishing between infection and cyst [[hemorrhage]] is often a challenge, and the diagnosis relies mainly on clinical and bacteriological findings. [[Radiological]] and [[nuclear imaging]] studies are generally not helpful.

Numerous extrarenal manifestations of ADPKD highlight the systemic nature of the disease, and likely reflect a generalized abnormality in [[collagen]] and [[extracellular matrix]]. Patients with ADPKD have an increased risk of [[cerebral hemorrhage]] from a ruptured [[intracranial]] [[aneurysm]], as compared to the general population. [[Saccular]] [[aneurysms]] of the [[anterior]] [[cerebral circulation]] may be detected in up to 10% of asymptomatic patients on [[Magnetic resonance angiography|MRA]] screening, but most are small, have a low risk of spontaneous rupture, and do not merit the risk of intervention. In general, hemorrhage tends to occur before the age of 50 years. In patients with a family history of intracranial hemorrhage, those who have survived a previous bleed have aneurysms larger than 10&nbsp;mm, and have uncontrolled hypertension. Other [[vascular]] abnormalities include [[aortic root]] and [[annulus dilatation]]. Cardiac valvular abnormalities occur in 25% of patients – most commonly [[mitral valve prolapse]] and [[aortic regurgitation]]. Although most valvular lesions are asymptomatic, some may progress over time, and warrant [[valve replacement]]. Abdominal [[hernia]] and [[inguinal hernia]] also occur with a higher frequency than in the general population.

==Diagnosis==
[[Ultrasonography]] reveals large, echogenic kidneys. The diagnosis can be made [[in utero]] after 24 weeks of [[gestation]] in severe cases, but cysts generally become visible only after birth. The absence of renal cysts in either parent on ultrasonography helps to distinguish [[ARPKD]] from [[ADPKD]] in older patients. The wide range of different [[mutations]] and the large size of the [[gene]] complicate [[molecular diagnosis]], although [[prenatal]] diagnosis is possible by gene linkage to the [[PKHD1]] locus in families with a previous confirmed ARPKD birth.

The sensitivity of renal [[ultrasonography]] for the detection of ADPKD is 100% for subjects 30 years or older with a positive family history. Diagnostic criteria require two or more cysts in one kidney and at least one cyst in the [[contralateral]] kidney in young subjects, but four or more in subjects older than 60 years, because of the increased frequency of [[benign simple cysts]]. Most often, the diagnosis is made from a positive [[family history]] and [[imaging studies]] showing large kidneys with multiple [[wiktionary:bilateral|bilateral]] cysts and possibly liver cysts. Before the age of 30 years, [[CT scan]] or T2-weighted [[MRI]] is more sensitive for detecting presymptomatic disease because the sensitivity of ultrasound falls to 95% for ADPKD type 1 and <70% for ADPKD type 2. Genetic counseling is essential for those being screened. It is recommended that screening for asymptomatic [[intracranial aneurysm]]s should be restricted to patients with a personal or family history of [[intracranial hemorrhage]]. Intervention should be limited to aneurysms larger than 10&nbsp;mm. Someone with this disease has a 5% chance of getting brain aneurysms.

==Treatment==
No specific therapy exists for ARPKD. Improvements in [[mechanical ventilation]], neonatal support, [[blood pressure]] management, [[dialysis]], and [[kidney transplantation]] have led to survival well into adulthood. Complications of [[hepatic fibrosis]] may necessitate [[liver transplantation]]. Future therapies may target aberrant cell signaling mechanisms, as in ADPKD.

At present, treatment is largely supportive, as there is no single therapy that has been shown to prevent the decline in kidney function. Hypertension control with a target blood pressure of 130/85 or less is recommended. Lower levels have been reported to slow the rate of loss of kidney function. A multidrug approach that includes agents to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system is frequently required. There is no compelling evidence to recommend a [[low-protein diet]], especially in patients with advanced kidney dysfunction where optimizing [[nutritional]] status is important. [[Lipid-soluble]] [[antimicrobials]], such as [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]] and [[quinolone]] antibiotics that have good tissue permeation, are the preferred therapy for infected kidney cysts. [[Pain]]-management occasionally requires cyst drainage by [[percutaneous aspiration]], [[sclerotherapy]] with [[alcohol]] or, rarely, [[surgical drainage]]. Patients with ADPKD appear      to have a survival advantage on either peritoneal or hemodialysis compared to patients with other causes of [[End-stage renal disease|ESRD]]. Those undergoing kidney transplantation may require bilateral [[nephrectomy]] if the kidneys are massively enlarged or have been the site of infected cysts. Post-transplantation survival rates are similar to those of patients with other causes of [[kidney failure]], but patients remain at risk for the extrarenal complications of ADPKD.

Studies in animal models of inherited cystic disease have identified promising therapeutic strategies, which are undergoing clinical research, including vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists (such as Tolvaptan), and mTOR inhibitors (such as [[Sirolimus]] or [[Everolimus]]).
