'''Earwax''', also known by the medical term '''cerumen''', is a yellowish [[wax]]y substance secreted in the [[ear canal]] of humans and other mammals.  It protects the skin of the human ear canal, assists in cleaning and lubrication, and also provides some protection from [[bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]], [[insect]]s and water.<ref>[http://www.american-hearing.org/disorders/hearing/ear_wax.html#whatis Earwax] at the American Hearing Research Foundation. Chicago, Illinois 2008.</ref> Excess or impacted cerumen can press against the [[eardrum]] and/or occlude the external auditory canal, usually hindering [[hearing (sense)|hearing]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Excessive earwax may impede the passage of [[sound]] in the ear canal, causing [[conductive hearing loss]].  It is also estimated to be the cause of 60–80% of [[hearing aid]] faults.<ref name=Oliveira>{{Cite journal|author=Oliveira RJ |title=The active earcanal |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Audiology |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=401–10 |year=1997 |month=December |pmid=9433686}}</ref>

==Physiology==
[[File:Earwax on swab (uv).jpg|thumb|Wet-type earwax fluoresces weakly under [[ultraviolet]] radiation.]]
Cerumen is produced in the outer third of the [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] portion of the ear canal.  It is a mixture of [[viscous]] [[secretion]]s from [[sebaceous gland]]s and less-viscous ones from modified [[apocrine sweat glands]].<ref name=Alvord>{{Cite journal|author=Alvord LS, Farmer BL |title=Anatomy and orientation of the human external ear |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Audiology |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=383–90 |year=1997 |month=December |pmid=9433684}}</ref>  The primary components of earwax are shed layers of skin, with 60% of the earwax consisting of [[keratin]], 12–20% saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acids, alcohols, [[squalene]] and 6–9% [[cholesterol]].<ref name=compo>{{Cite journal|author=Guest JF, Greener MJ, Robinson AC, Smith AF |title=Impacted cerumen: composition, production, epidemiology and management |journal=QJM |volume=97 |issue=8 |pages=477–88 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15256605 |doi=10.1093/qjmed/hch082}}</ref>

There are two distinct [[genetics|genetically]] determined types of earwax: the wet type, which is [[dominant gene|dominant]], and the dry type, which is [[recessive gene|recessive]]. While [[Asian people|Asians]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] are more likely to have the dry type of cerumen (gray and flaky), [[Black people|African]] and [[White people|European]] people are more likely to have the wet type (honey-brown to dark-brown and moist).<ref name=Overfield>{{Cite book|author=Overfield, Theresa |title=Biologic variation in health and illness: race, age, and sex differences |publisher=Addison-Wesley, Nursing Division |location=Menlo Park, Calif |year=1985 |page=46 |isbn=0-201-12810-1 |quote=... most common type in Whites and Blacks is dark brown and moist.

The difference in cerumen type has been tracked to a single [[base pair|base]] change (a [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]) in a gene known as "[[ABCC11|ATP-binding cassette C11 gene]]".<ref>{{OMIM|117800}}</ref> Dry-type individuals are [[Zygosity#Homozygous | homozygous]] for [[adenine]] whereas wet-type requires at least one [[guanine]].  Wet-type earwax is associated with armpit odor, which is increased by [[sweating|sweat]] production.

===Cleaning===
Cleaning of the ear canal occurs as a result of the "conveyor belt" process of [[epithelium|epithelial]] migration, aided by [[jaw]] movement.<ref name=Alberti>{{Cite journal|author=Alberti PW |title=Epithelial migration on the tympanic membrane |journal=The Journal of Laryngology and Otology |volume=78 |issue= |pages=808–30 |year=1964 |month=September |pmid=14205963}}</ref>  Cells formed in the centre of the [[Ear drum|tympanic membrane]] migrate outwards from the [[umbo of tympanic membrane|umbo]] (at a rate comparable to that of fingernail growth) to the walls of the ear canal, and move towards the entrance of the ear canal.  The cerumen in the canal is also carried outwards, taking with it any dirt, dust, and particulate matter that may have gathered in the canal.  Jaw movement assists this process by dislodging debris attached to the walls of the ear canal, increasing the likelihood of its expulsion.

===Lubrication===
Lubrication prevents [[desiccation]], itching, and burning of the [[skin]] within the ear canal (known as ''asteatosis''). The lubricative properties arise from the high [[lipid]] content of the sebum produced by the sebaceous glands.  In wet-type cerumen at least, these lipids include [[cholesterol]], [[squalene]], and many long-chain [[fatty acid]]s and [[alcohol]]s.<ref name=Harvey>{{Cite journal|author=Harvey DJ |title=Identification of long-chain fatty acids and alcohols from human cerumen by the use of picolinyl and nicotinate esters |journal=Biomedical & Environmental Mass Spectrometry |volume=18 |issue=9 |pages=719–23 |year=1989 |month=September |pmid=2790258 |doi=10.1002/bms.1200180912}}</ref><ref name=Bortz>{{Cite journal|author=Bortz JT, Wertz PW, Downing DT |title=Composition of cerumen lipids |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=23 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=845–9 |year=1990 |month=November |pmid=2254469 |doi=10.1016/0190-9622(90)70301-W}}</ref>

===Antimicrobial effects===
While studies conducted up until the 1960s found little evidence supporting antibacterial activity for cerumen,<ref name=Perry>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/jid.1956.22|author=Nichols AC, Perry ET |title=Studies on the growth of bacteria in the human ear canal |journal=The Journal of Investigative Dermatology |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=165–70 |year=1956 |month=September |pmid=13367525}}</ref> more recent studies have found that cerumen has a bactericidal effect on some strains of bacteria.  Cerumen has been found to reduce the viability of a wide range of bacteria, including ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', and many variants of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', sometimes by as much as 99%.<ref name=Chai>{{Cite journal|author=Chai TJ, Chai TC |title=Bactericidal activity of cerumen |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=638–41 |year=1980 |month=October |pmid=7447422 |pmc=284062 |url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7447422}}</ref><ref name=Stone>{{Cite journal|author=Stone M, Fulghum RS |title=Bactericidal activity of wet cerumen |journal=The Annals of Otology, Rhinology, and Laryngology |volume=93 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=183–6 |year=1984 |pmid=6370076}}</ref>  The growth of two [[fungus|fungi]] commonly present in [[otomycosis]] was also significantly inhibited by human cerumen.<ref name=Megarry>{{Cite journal|author=Megarry S, Pett A, Scarlett A, Teh W, Zeigler E, Canter RJ |title=The activity against yeasts of human cerumen |journal=The Journal of Laryngology and Otology |volume=102 |issue=8 |pages=671–2 |year=1988 |month=August |pmid=3047287}}</ref> These antimicrobial properties are due principally to the presence of [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] fatty acids, [[lysozyme]] and, especially, to the slight acidity of cerumen ([[pH]] typically around 6.1 in normal individuals<ref name=Roland>{{Cite journal|author=Roland PS, Marple BF |title=Disorders of the external auditory canal |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Audiology |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=367–78 |year=1997 |month=December |pmid=9433682}}</ref>).

===Softeners===
This process is referred to as ''cerumenolysis'' and is achieved using a solution known as a cerumenolytic agent, which is introduced into the ear canal. It usually makes the wax come out,<ref name=HE>[http://www.hygieneexpert.co.uk/EarCareWaxBuildUp.html hygieneexpert.co.uk] Ear Care and Wax Build Up</ref> and if it doesn't, it facilitates removal by syringing or curettage.

===Ear irrigation===
Once the cerumen has been softened, it may be removed from the ear canal by irrigation. This may be effectively accomplished with a spray type ear washer, commonly used in the medical setting or at home, or with a bulb [[syringe]] at home.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Coppin R, Wicke D, Little P |title=Randomized trial of bulb syringes for earwax: impact on health service utilization |journal=Ann Fam Med |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=110–4 |year=2011 |pmid=21403136 |doi=10.1370/afm.1229 |url=}}</ref> Ear syringing techniques are described in great detail by Wilson & Roeser,<ref name=Wilson/> and Blake et al.,<ref name=Blake>{{Cite journal|author=Blake P, Matthews R, Hornibrook J |title=When not to syringe an ear |journal=The New Zealand Medical Journal |volume=111 |issue=1077 |pages=422–4 |year=1998 |month=November |pmid=9861921}}</ref> who advise pulling the external ear up and back, and aiming the nozzle of the syringe slightly upwards and backwards so that the water flows as a cascade along the roof of the canal. The irrigation solution flows out of the canal along its floor, taking wax and debris with it. The solution used to irrigate the ear canal is usually warm water,<ref name=Blake/> normal [[saline (medicine)|saline]],<ref name=Ernst>{{Cite journal|author=Ernst AA, Takakuwa KM, Letner C, Weiss SJ |title=Warmed versus room temperature saline solution for ear irrigation: a randomized clinical trial |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=347–50 |year=1999 |month=September |pmid=10459091 |doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(99)70129-0}}</ref> sodium bicarbonate solution,<ref name=Bull>{{Cite book|author=Bull, P.

Patients generally prefer the irrigation solution to be warmed to body temperature,<ref name=Ernst/> as [[dizziness]] is a common side effect of ear washing or syringing with fluids that are colder or warmer than body temperature.  Sharp et al.<ref name=Sharp/> recommend 37 °C, while Blake et al.<ref name=Blake/> recommend using water at 38 °C, one degree above body temperature, and stress that this should be checked with a thermometer. Any other temperature may cause [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], just as used when testing the [[caloric reflex test]].

A syringe or spray type ear washer should be used to gently stream water into the ear. For children the rate and speed should be lower.  After irrigating, the head is tipped to allow the water to drain. Irrigation may need to be repeated several times. If the water stream hurts, then the flow should be slower. It is better to irrigate too gently for a long period than irrigate too forcefully attempting to remove wax quickly. This procedure can be done at home in the shower using an ear irrigation syringe with a right angle tip. After the wax is removed, the ear can be dried by tipping the head and gently pulling the ear upwards to straighten the ear canal.

===Curette and cotton swabs===
Earwax can be removed with an [[ear pick]]/curette, which physically dislodges the earwax and scoops it out of the ear canal. In the west, use of ear picks is usually only done by health professionals; a modified curette having a safety stop to prevent deep insertion for self-use is available. Curetting earwax using an ear pick is common in [[East Asia]]. As the earwax of most Asians is of the dry type,<ref name=Overfield/> it is extremely easily removed by light scraping with an ear pick, as it simply falls out in large pieces or dry flakes, often on its own.

It is generally advised not to use [[cotton swab]]s (Q-Tips or cotton buds), as doing so will likely push the wax farther down the ear canal, and if used carelessly, [[Perforation_of_the_eardrum|perforate]] the [[eardrum]].<ref name="Ear wax"/> Abrasion of the ear canal, particularly after water has entered from swimming or bathing, can lead to ear infection. Also, the cotton head may fall off and become lodged in the ear canal. Cotton swabs should be used only to clean the external ear.{{cn|date=January 2013}}

===Ear candles and vacuuming===
[[Ear candling]], also called ear coning or thermal-auricular therapy, is an [[alternative medicine]] practice claimed to improve general health and well-being by lighting one end of a hollow [[candle]] and placing the other end in the [[ear canal]]. According to medical researchers, it is both dangerous and ineffective.<ref name="Seely">{{Cite journal|author=Seely DR, Quigley SM, Langman AW |title=Ear candles--efficacy and safety |journal=The Laryngoscope |volume=106 |issue=10 |pages=1226–9 |year=1996 |month=October |pmid=8849790 |doi=10.1097/00005537-199610000-00010}}</ref> Advocates say that the dark residue that shows after the procedure is extracted earwax, proving the efficacy of the procedure. Studies have shown that in fact the same residue is left whether or not the candle (which is made of cotton fabric and beeswax and leaves a residue after burning) is inserted into an ear. This means that the wax residue is derived from the candle itself and not the ear. The color of the candle wax deliberately matches the light brown-colored wax of the human ear, making the distinction between the two more difficult for a layperson. Because the candle itself is a hollow tube, some of the hot burnt wax can drop down inside the candle, into the ear canal, potentially rupturing the eardrum. The [[American Academy of Otolaryngology]] states that ear candles are not a safe option for removing ear wax, and that no controlled studies or scientific evidence support their use for ear wax removal.<ref name=AAO>{{cite web|title=Earwax|url=http://www.entnet.org/HealthInformation/earwax.cfm|work=www.entnet.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Otolaryngology]]|accessdate=23 April 2012}}</ref> The [[Food and Drug Administration]] has successfully taken several regulatory actions against the sale and distribution of ear candles since 1996, including seizing ear candle products and ordering injunctions.<ref name=AAO/>

Home "ear vacs" were ineffective at removing ear-wax, especially when compared to a Jobson-Horne probe.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Leong AC, Aldren C |title=A non-randomized comparison of earwax removal with a 'do-it-yourself' ear vacuum kit and a Jobson-Horne probe |journal=Clinical Otolaryngology|volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=320–3 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16209672|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2273.2005.01020.x}}</ref>

===Complications of removal===
A postal survey of British general practitioners<ref name=Sharp/> found that only 19% always performed cerumen removal themselves; many delegated the task to practice nurses, some of whom had received no instruction.  It is problematic as the removal of cerumen is not without risk.  Irrigation can be performed at home with proper equipment as long as the person is careful not to irrigate too hard.  All other methods should only be carried out by individuals who have been sufficiently trained in the procedure.

The author Bull advised physicians: ''"After removal of wax, inspect thoroughly to make sure none remains.  This advice might seem superfluous, but is frequently ignored."''<ref name=Bull/> This was confirmed by Sharp et al.,<ref name=Sharp/> who, in a survey of 320 general practitioners, found that only 68% of doctors inspected the ear canal after syringing to check that the wax was removed. As a result, failure to remove the wax from the canal made up approximately 30% of the complications associated with the procedure. Other complications included [[otitis externa]] (swimmer's ear), which involves inflammation or bacterial infection of the external acoustic meatus, as well as [[pain]], [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[tinnitus]], and perforation of the ear drum.  Based on this study, a rate of major complications in 1/1000 ears syringed was suggested.<ref name=Sharp/>

Claims arising from ear syringing mishaps account for about 25% of the total claims received by [[New Zealand]]'s [[Accident Compensation Corporation]] ENT Medical Misadventure Committee.<ref name=Blake/> While high, this is not surprising, as ear syringing is an extremely common procedure.  Grossan suggested that approximately 150,000 ears are irrigated each week in the United States, and about 40,000 per week in the United Kingdom.<ref name=Grossan>{{Cite journal|author=Grossan M |title=Cerumen removal--current challenges |journal=Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal |volume=77 |issue=7 |pages=541–6, 548 |year=1998 |month=July |pmid=9693470}}</ref>  Extrapolating from data obtained in Edinburgh, Sharp et al.<ref name=Sharp/> place this figure much higher, estimating that approximately 7000 ears are syringed per 100,000 population per annum. In the New Zealand claims mentioned above, perforation of the tympanic membrane was by far the most common injury resulting in significant disability.

==History==
The treatment of ear wax was described by [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] in ''[[De Medicina]]'' in the first century:<ref>{{cite web|first=Aulus Cornelius |last=Celsus |authorlink=Aulus Cornelius Celsus |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Celsus/6*.html|title=Book VI  |work=[[De Medicina]] |coauthors=W.G. Spencer translation}}</ref>

{{quotation|
When a man is becoming dull of hearing, which happens most often after prolonged headaches, in the first place, the ear itself should be inspected: for there will be found either a crust such as comes upon the surface of [[wiktionary:ulcer|ulceration]]s, or concretions of wax.  If a crust, hot oil is poured in, or [[verdigris]] mixed with [[honey]] or [[leek]] juice or a little [[sodium carbonate|soda]] in [[honey wine]]. And when the crust has been separated from the ulceration, the ear is irrigated with tepid water, to make it easier for the crusts now disengaged to be withdrawn by the [[ear scoop]].  If it be wax, and if it be soft, it can be extracted in the same way by the ear scoop; but if hard, [[vinegar]] containing a little [[Salsola soda|soda]]<ref>''"acetum et cum eo nitri paulum"''.
