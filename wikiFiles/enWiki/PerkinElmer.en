'''PerkinElmer, Inc.''' is an American [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] technology corporation, focused in the business areas of human and environmental health, including environmental analysis, food and consumer product safety, medical imaging, drug discovery, diagnostics, biotechnology, industrial applications, and life science research. PerkinElmer produces analytical instruments, genetic testing and diagnostic tools, medical imaging components, software, instruments, and consumables for multiple end markets.

PerkinElmer is part of the [[S&P 500]] index and operates in 150 countries. As of 2010, it has a [[market capitalization]] of ~3.0 billion USD.

==History==
PerkinElmer traces its history back to a merger between divisions of what had been two [[S&P 500]] companies, [[EG&G]] Inc. (formerly {{nyse2|EGG}}) of [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]] and Perkin-Elmer (formerly {{nyse2|PKN}}) of [[Norwalk, Connecticut]]. On May 28, 1999, the non-government side of EG&G Inc. purchased the Analytical Instruments Division of Perkin-Elmer, its traditional business segment, for US$425 million, also assuming the Perkin-Elmer name and forming the new '''PerkinElmer''' company, with new officers and a new Board of Directors.<ref name="peceoletter">[http://www.applera.com/annualreports/annual99/letter_tony.html What is the logic of biology? A letter from Tony White to our shareholders], PE Corporation, 1999 Annual Report, CEO letter</ref><ref name="nyt990715">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E6DA173FF936A25754C0A96F958260 COMPANY NEWS; PERKIN-ELMER CUTS 12% OF WORK FORCE], New York Times, Published: July 15, 1999</ref> At the time, EG&G made products for diverse industries including automotive, medical, aerospace and photography.<ref name="nyt990715"/>

The old Perkin-Elmer Board of Directors and Officers remained at that reorganized company under its new name, [[PE Corporation]]. It had been the [[Life Sciences]] division of Perkin-Elmer, and its two component [[tracking stock]] business groups, [[Celera Genomics]] ({{nyse2|CRA}}) and [[PE Biosystems]] (formerly {{nyse2|PEB}}), were centrally involved in the highest profile [[biotechnology]] events of the decade, the intense race against the [[Human Genome Project]] consortium, which then resulted in the [[genomics]] segment of the [[technology bubble]].

[[EG&G]] began in 1931; It was started by two [[MIT]] professors, [[Harold Edgerton]] and Kenneth Germeshausen in a Boston garage. The company was originally incorporated in 1947 as [[EG&G]].

Perkin-Elmer was founded in 1937 by [[Richard Scott Perkin|Richard Perkin]] and [[Charles Wesley Elmer|Charles Elmer]] as an optical design and consulting company. In 1944, Perkin-Elmer entered the analytical-instruments business, and in the early 1990s, partnered with [[Cetus Corporation]] (and later [[Hoffmann-La Roche]]) to pioneer the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) equipment industry. Analytical-instruments business was also operated from 1954 to 2001 in Germany, by the ''Bodenseewerk Perkin-Elmer GmbH'' located in [[Ãœberlingen]] at [[Lake Constance]].

==KH-9 Hexagon==
Perkin-Elmer built the optical systems for the [[KH-9 Hexagon]] series of [[spy satellite]]s at a facility in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[Connecticut]].<ref name="ap2011-12-25-10-26-53">{{cite news

==Hubble optics failure==
[[Image:Hubble mirror polishing.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Polishing of Hubble's primary mirror begins at Perkin-Elmer corporation, [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[Connecticut]], May 1979. The engineer pictured is Dr. Martin Yellin, an optical engineer working for Perkin-Elmer on the project.]]
Perkin-Elmer was commissioned to build the optical components of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. The construction of the main mirror was begun in 1979 and completed in 1981. The polishing process ran over budget and behind schedule, producing significant friction with [[NASA]]. Due to a miscalibrated [[null corrector]], the primary mirror was also found to have a significant [[spherical aberration]] after reaching orbit on [[STS-31]]. A NASA investigation heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for management failings, disregarding written quality guidelines, and ignoring test data that showed this miscalibration.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19910003124_1991003124.pdf ''The Hubble Space Telescope Optical Systems Failure Report'']|5.62&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 5897672 bytes -->}}, 1990, Lew Allen, Chairman, NASA Technical Report NASA-TM-103443. The spacing of the field lens in the corrector was to have been done by laser measurements off the end of an invar bar. Instead of illuminating the end of the bar, however, the laser in fact was reflected from a worn spot on a black-anodized metal cap placed over the end of the bar to isolate its center (visible through a hole in the cap). The technician who performed the test noted an unexpected gap between the field lens and its supporting structure in the corrector and filled it in with an ordinary metal washer.  (No longer available prior to 10/09)</ref> Corrective optics were installed on the telescope during the first Hubble service and repair mission [[STS-61]]. The correction, [[COSTAR]], was applied entirely to the secondary mirror and replaced existing instrumentation: the primary mirror still has a significant aberration.

==PerkinElmer today==
In 1992 the company merged with [[Applied Biosystems]]. In 1997 they merged with [[PerSeptive Biosystems]]. On July 14, 1999 the new analytical instruments maker PerkinElmer cut 350 jobs, or 12%, in its cost reduction reorganization.<ref name="nyt990715"/> In 2006 PerkinElmer sold off the Fluid Sciences division for approximately $400M, the aim on the sell off was to increase the strategic focus on its higher-growth health sciences and photonic markets. Following on from the sell off a number of leading /dynamic small businesses were acquired, these included Spectral Genomics, [http://www.improvision.com Improvision], Evotec-Technologies, Euroscreen, ViaCell and Avalon Instruments. The brand "Evotec-Technologies" remains the property of [http://www.evotec.com Evotec], the former owner company. PerkinElmer had a license to use the brand till the end of year 2007. 

PerkinElmer has continued to expand its interest in medicine with the acquisitions of clinical laboratories,  In July 2006, it acquired [http://www.ntdlabs.com/ NTD Labs] located on Long Island, New York.  The laboratory specializes in prenatal screening during the first trimester of pregnancy. In October 2007, it purchased ViaCell, Inc. with its offices in Boston and cord blood storage facility in Kentucky near Cincinnati.  The company was renamed [http://www.viacord.com/ ViaCord].

In March 2008, PerkinElmer purchased Pediatrix Screening (formerly Neo Gen Screening), a laboratory located in Bridgeville, PA specializing in screening newborns for various inborn errors of metabolism such as [[phenylketonuria]], [[hypothyroidism]],  and [[sickle-cell disease]].  It renamed the laboratory [http://www.perkinelmergenetics.com/ PerkinElmer Genetics, Inc.]

In May 2011, PerkinElmer announced the signature of an agreement to acquire [[CambridgeSoft]], and the successful acquisition of ArtusLabs.<ref>{{cite web
