'''Targeted therapy of lung cancer''' refers to using agents specifically designed to selectively target molecular pathways responsible for, or that substantially drive, the [[malignant]] [[phenotype]] of [[lung cancer]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]], and as a consequence of this (relative) selectivity, cause fewer [[toxic]] effects on normal cells.

Most previous [[chemotherapy]] drugs for cancer were (relatively) nonselective in their activity. Although their exact mechanisms of action were varied and complex, they generally worked by damaging cells undergoing [[mitosis]], which is usually more common in malignant tumors than in most normal tissues. Targeted agents are designed to be selective in their effects by modulating the activity of [[proteins]] necessary and essential for [[oncogenesis]] and maintenance of cancer, particularly [[enzymes]] driving the uncontrolled growth, angiogenesis, invasiveness, and [[metastasis]] characteristic of malignant tumors. The increased differential activity usually results in fewer troubling [[side effects]] for cancer patients, particularly less [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and death of cells in the [[bone marrow]] and [[gastrointestinal tract]], and increased effectiveness against tumor cells.

Approximately 98% of lung cancers are [[carcinoma]], a term describing malignancies derived from transformed cells exhibiting characteristics of [[epithelium]]. About 2% of all lung cancers are non-carcinoma (mainly [[sarcoma]], tumors of [[hematopoietic]] origin, or [[germ cell]] tumors.<ref name='TravisTravis'>{{cite journal |author=Travis WD, Travis LB, Devesa SS |title=Lung cancer |journal=[[Cancer]] |volume=75 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=191–202 |year=1995 |month=January |pmid=8000996 |doi= 10.1002/1097-0142(19950101)75:1+<191::AID-CNCR2820751307>3.0.CO;2-Y|url= }}</ref> These forms of lung cancer are usually treated differently to carcinomas. Because of the ubiquity of lung carcinomas, however, the term "lung cancer" generally refers to carcinomas in everyday clinical practice.

Despite the large number of histological variants of lung carcinoma, oncologists have long tended to favor a dichotomous division into small cell and non-small cell forms, based on differences in clinical behavior and response to treatment. Most small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC's) metastasize to distant organs early on in their course, rendering surgery ineffective in curing the cancer. In contrast, non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC's) are more likely to remain localized to the [[thorax]] during development, and are thus more amenable to cure using radical surgical resection. Additionally, SCLC's are typically much more sensitive to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy than are NSCLC's. Therefore, current traditional treatment guidelines and standards of care recommend, when possible, the use of surgery for NSCLC, and chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy for SCLC.<REF NAME='SimonTurrisi'>{{cite journal |author=Simon GR, Turrisi A |title=Management of small cell lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) |journal=[[Chest (journal)|Chest]] |volume=132 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=324S–339S |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17873178 |doi=10.1378/chest.07-1385 |url= }}</ref><ref name='NSCLCGuidelines'>{{cite journal |author=Pisters KM, Evans WK, Azzoli CG, Kris MG, Smith CA, Desch CE, Somerfield MR, Brouwers MC, Darling G, Ellis PM, Gaspar LE, Pass HI, Spigel DR, Strawn JR, Ung YC, Shepherd FA |title=Cancer Care Ontario and American Society of Clinical Oncology adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant radiation therapy for stages I-IIIA resectable non small-cell lung cancer guideline |journal=[[Journal of Clinical Oncology]] |volume=25 |issue=34 |pages=5506–18 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=17954710 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2007.14.1226 |url= }}</ref>
