==Definition==
'''Taijin kyofusho''' (対人恐怖症 taijin kyōfushō, '''TKS''', for ''taijin kyofusho symptoms''), is a [[Japan]]ese [[culture-specific syndrome]]. The term taijin kyofusho literally means the disorder (sho) of fear (kyofu) of interpersonal relations (taijin). Dr. [[Shoma Morita]] first described the condition as vicious cycle of self-examination and reproach which can occur in people of hypochondriacal temperament.

==Subtypes==
Taijin kyofusho is commonly described as a form of [[social anxiety]] (social [[phobia]]), with the sufferer dreading and avoiding social contact, and as a subtype of ''shinkeishitsu'' ([[anxiety disorder]]).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1363461504047933 |title=Taijin Kyofusho in University Students: Patterns of Fear and Predispositions to the Offensive Variant |year=2004 |last1=Tarumi |first1=S. |journal=Transcultural Psychiatry |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=533–46 |pmid=15709650 |last2=Ichimiya |first2=A |last3=Yamada |first3=S |last4=Umesue |first4=M |last5=Kuroki |first5=T}}</ref> However, instead of a fear of [[Embarassment|embarrassing]] themselves or being harshly judged by others because of their social ineptness, sufferers of taijin kyofusho report a fear of offending or harming other people.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=520018 |year=1979 |last1=Tanaka-Matsumi |first1=J |title=Taijin Kyofusho: Diagnostic and cultural issues in Japanese psychiatry |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=231–45 |journal=Culture, medicine and psychiatry}}</ref> The focus is thus on avoiding harm to others rather than to oneself.

One source even breaks Taijin into two different subtypes: neurotic and offensive. The first subtype can be broken into two parts (classical type and avoidant type). The classical type being afraid of being judged negatively because of physical signs of anxiety and feeling shame due to anxiety. The physical signs that can cause fear of being judged include sweating and tremors. The second subtype deals with people thinking something about them is offensive and some of their fears include body odor, gas, to match eye contact not enough eye contact, blushing, etc.

In the official Japanese diagnostic system, taijin kyofusho is subdivided into the following categories:<ref>{{cite book |year=2012 |chapter=Culture specific diagnoses |chapterurl=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/328181.html |editor1-first=Sana |editor1-last=Loue |editor2-first=Martha |editor2-last=Sajatovic |title=Encyclopedia of Immigrant health |location=New York |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4419-5659-0}}{{pn|date=April 2013}}</ref>
* Sekimen-kyofu, the phobia of [[blushing]] (ereuthophobia)
* Shubo-kyofu, the phobia of a deformed body, similar to [[Body dysmorphic disorder]]
* Jikoshisen-kyofu, the phobia of [[eye contact]]
* [[Jikoshu-kyofu]], the phobia of having foul [[body odor]] (osmophobia, bromidrosiphobia)

Taijin kyofusho is not detailed as distinct from [[social anxiety disorder]] in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM IV]]. This is under debate, however, as symptoms indicative of taijin kyofusho are sometimes found in patients in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0887-6185(90)90025-5 |title=Taijin-kyofu-sho in a black American woman: Behavioral treatment of a 'culture-bound' anxiety disorder |year=1990 |last1=McNally |first1=Richard J. |last2=Cassiday |first2=Karen L. |last3=Calamari |first3=John E. |journal=Journal of Anxiety Disorders |volume=4 |pages=83–7}}</ref>
==Prevalence==
Typically diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood, taijin kyofusho affects 10-20% of the Japanese population. Clinical data indicates that more males have the condition than females despite the fact that females scored higher on a social phobia scale and report higher scores on proclivity towards feelings of embarrassment than their male counterparts. This differs from Western society where the prevalence of females with social phobias is to some extent greater than that of males.<ref>{{cite web |title=Taijin Kyofusho: A Culture-Bound Syndrome |url=http://www.brainphysics.com/taijin-kyofusho.php |last=Saunders |first=Dustin |work=BrainPhysics.com |publisher=The Deep Health Network |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref> The lifetime prevalence of the disorder falls anywhere between 3% and 13% with changes in severity occurring throughout one's lifetime. It is estimated that about 17% of individuals with taijin kyofusho have fears of releasing foul body odor.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/da.20688 |title=Olfactory reference syndrome: Issues for DSM-V |year=2010 |last1=Feusner |first1=Jamie D. |last2=Phillips |first2=Katharine A. |last3=Stein |first3=Dan J. |journal=Depression and Anxiety |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=592–9 |pmid=20533369}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
A person may be diagnosed with Taijin Kyofusho (TKS), if they feel as if their attitudes, behavior, and physical characteristics are inadequate in social situations. As a result of these feelings, they also experience persistent suffering in the form of emotional distress through [[shame]], embarrassment, anxiety, fear, and other tense feelings when confronted with social circumstances. In addition, individuals also worry about being unable to maintain healthy relationships with others. When it comes to socializing, TKS sufferers avoid painful social and interpersonal situations, while simultaneously being averse to doing so.

==Treatment==
The standard Japanese treatment for taijin kyofusho is [[Morita therapy]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Kora |first=T. |title=Morita Therapy |accessdate=March 29, 2013 |publisher=The ToDo Institute |url=http://www.todoinstitute.org/morita.html}}</ref> developed by Dr. Shoma Morita in the 1910s as a treatment for the Japanese mental disorders taijin kyofusho and shinkeishitsu ([[Anxiety|nervousness]]). The original regimen involved patient isolation, enforced [[bed rest]], diary writing, manual labor, and lectures on the importance of self-acceptance and positive endeavor. Since the 1930s, the treatment has been modified to include out-patient and group treatments; this modified version is known as neo-Morita therapy. Medications have also gained acceptance as a treatment option for taijin kyofusho.

[[Milnacipran]], a [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (SNRI), is currently used in the treatment of taijin kyofusho and has been shown to be efficacious for [[social anxiety disorder]].<ref name=amn>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13651500510029228 |title=Effect of milnacipran on insight and stress coping strategy in patients with Taijin Kyofusho |year=2005 |last1=Nagata |first1=Toshihiko |last2=Wada |first2=Akira |last3=Yamada |first3=Hisashi |last4=Iketani |first4=Toshiya |last5=Kiriike |first5=Obuo |journal=International Journal of Psychiatry in Clinical Practice |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=193}}</ref>
