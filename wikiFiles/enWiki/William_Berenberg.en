'''William Berenberg, M.D.''' (October 29, 1915 &ndash; September 14, 2005) was an [[United States|American]] [[physician]],  [[Harvard]] [[professor]], and pioneer in the treatment and rehabilitation of [[cerebral palsy]].

==Early life==
Berenberg was born in [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]] to immigrant parents. Growing up in [[Chelsea, Massachusetts]], he proved a bright and studious young man and earned admission to [[Harvard University]] on scholarship. However, his father was reportedly too proud to allow his son to take the "hand-out" and Berenberg worked his own way through the [[Ivy League]] institution, commuting from home and cleaning dishes for extra income.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Nell Porter|title=Staying Active without Climbing Mount Everest|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/07/staying-active-without-c.html|work=July 2000|publisher=Harvard Magazine|accessdate=5 October 2010}}</ref>
He graduated from [[Harvard]] cum laude in 1936 and entered [[Boston University School of Medicine|Boston University Medical School]] later that year, earning his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in 1940. In 1941, Dr. Berenberg entered the [[pathology]] department of [[Children's Hospital Boston|Children's Hospital]] in Boston as an intern. Thus began his extraordinary sixty year relationship with the hospital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.childrenshospital.org/clinicalservices/Site1173/mainpageS1173P5sublevel10.html |title=Orthopedic Surgery - History of Innovations |publisher=Childrenshospital.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-05}}</ref><ref>{{citation

==Career==
He was Chief, Interim Chief or Associate Chief of seven divisions, including serving as Associate Physician-in-Chief from 1969 to 1974, and Chief of the Cerebral Palsy Division for 44 years. He was a worldwide leader in the study and treatment of [[cerebral palsy]] and opened the first cerebral palsy kindergarten in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]]. In 1968, he was elected president of the [[American Academy of Cerebral Palsy]]. Along with friend and fellow cerebral palsy advocate [[Leonard Goldenson]], Dr. Berenberg appeared before the U.S. [[House Appropriations Committee]] in 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucp.org/ucp_generaldoc.cfm/1/3/42/42-6593/218 |title=UCP About UCP: Mission & History - The 1970's |publisher=Ucp.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-05}}</ref> He successfully lobbied for the [[Rehabilitation Act]], which was arguably the first piece of landmark legislation enacted to protect the disabled, outlawing discrimination based on handicap. In it, public funding was secured for orthopedic equipment. Dr. Berenberg became an adjunct professor at [[MIT]] and, from 1974â€“1988, directed the [[Harvard]] - [[MIT]] Rehabilitation Engineering Center, where he coordinated research to create devices to help those with disabilities.

A Professor of [[Pediatrics]] at [[Harvard Medical School]], Berenberg trained over 1,000 pediatricians and treated many thousands of children, including President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s late son [[Patrick Bouvier Kennedy|Patrick]]. Housecalls in eastern Massachusetts were common, but he also built a large international practice, with patients from Mexico to Saudi Arabia. Dr. Berenberg was the official medical consultant to the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Grace|first=Francie|title=Happy Anniversary: Polio Vaccine 50 Years After Scientific Triumph, Virus Is Nearly Wiped Out In U.S.|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/04/12/health/main687379.shtml|work=April 12, 2005|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=5 October 2010|date=12 April 2005}}</ref>

==Recognition==
Dr. Berenberg received numerous honors and awards during his long career. Early on, he was lauded by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for his research in [[gamma globulin]]. In 1970, the [[President of Ecuador]] awarded him the [[National Order of Merit (Ecuador)|National Order of Merit]] with the grade of commander for service to that nation's children. In 1980, he was awarded the Janeway Award for Excellence in Clinical Teaching from the house staff. In 1990, Dr. Berenberg received a distinct honor when many of his colleagues, supporters, and former patients raised funds to endow the [[William Berenberg Professorship of Pediatrics]] at [[Harvard Medical School]]. Dr. Frederick Lovejoy was the first to hold the chair.<ref>{{cite web|last=Oranshy|first=Ivan|title=$185M Campaign Draws To Close|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1991/6/6/185m-campaign-draws-to-close-pjust/|work=June 6, 1991|publisher=The Harvard Crimson |accessdate=5 October 2010}}</ref>
