'''Risk factors of breast cancer''' may be divided into preventable and non preventable. Their study belongs in the field of [[epidemiology]]. [[Breast cancer]], like other forms of cancer, can result from multiple environmental and hereditary risk factors.  The term ''environmental'', as used by cancer researchers, means any risk factor that is not genetically inherited.  

For breast cancer, the list of environmental risk factors includes the individual person's development, exposure to [[microbe]]s, "medical interventions, dietary exposures to nutrients, energy and toxicants, ionizing radiation, and chemicals from industrial and agricultural processes and from consumer products...reproductive choices, energy balance, adult weight gain, body fatness, voluntary and involuntary physical activity, medical care, exposure to tobacco smoke and alcohol, and occupational exposures, including shift work" as well as "metabolic and physiologic processes that modify the body's internal environment."<ref name=IOM>{{cite book |author=Institute of Medicine |title=Breast Cancer and the Environment: A Life Course Approach (Institute of Medicine) |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=2012 |pages=52–53 |isbn=0-309-22069-6 |oclc= |doi= |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13263&page=52 |accessdate=}}</ref>  Some of these environmental factors are part of the physical environment, while others (such as diet and number of pregnancies) are primarily part of the social, cultural, or economic environment.<ref name=IOM />

Although many epidemiological risk factors have been identified, the cause of any individual breast cancer is most often unknowable. Epidemiological research informs the patterns of breast cancer incidence across certain populations, but not in a given individual. Approximately 5% of new breast cancers are attributable to hereditary syndromes, and well-established risk factors accounts for approximately 30% of cases.<!-- source says 47% but the 19% attributed to "income" are not medically established risk factor - they reflect the influence of risk factors that are not yet well understood --><ref name=Madigan_1995>{{cite journal | author = Madigan MP, Ziegler RG, Benichou J, Byrne C, Hoover RN | title = Proportion of breast cancer cases in the United States explained by well-established risk factors | journal = J.

The risk of getting breast cancer increases with age.  A woman is more than 100 times more likely to develop breast cancer in her 60s than in her 20s.<ref name=Margolese>{{cite book

The probability of breast cancer increases with age, but breast cancer tends to be more aggressive in younger people.

==Sex==
Men have a much lower risk of developing breast cancer than women.  In developed countries, about 99% of breast cancer cases are diagnosed in women; in a few African countries, which represent the highest incidence of male breast cancer, men account for 5–15% of breast cancer cases.<ref name=Margolese />  The rate of breast cancer in men appears to be rising somewhat.<ref name="Giordano">{{cite journal |author=Giordano SH, Cohen DS, Buzdar AU, Perkins G, Hortobagyi GN |title=Breast carcinoma in men: a population-based study |journal=Cancer |volume=101 |issue=1 |pages=51–7 |year=2004 |month=July |pmid=15221988 |doi=10.1002/cncr.20312}}</ref>

Men diagnosed with breast cancer tend to be older than women with breast cancer.<ref name=Margolese />  They are more likely to be diagnosed with hormone-receptor positive tumors, with about six out of seven cases being estrogen-receptor positive.<ref name=Margolese />  The overall prognosis is worse for men than for women.<ref name=Margolese />

==Heredity==
{{Further|Cancer syndrome|Hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome}}
[[United Kingdom]] being a member of the [[International Cancer Genome Consortium]] is leading efforts to map breast cancer's complete [[genome]].

===BRCA1 and BRCA2===
In 5% of breast cancer cases, there is a strong inherited familial risk.<ref name="pmid9544766">{{cite journal |author=Malone KE, Daling JR, Thompson JD, O'Brien CA, Francisco LV, Ostrander EA |title=BRCA1 mutations and breast cancer in the general population: analyses in women before age 35 years and in women before age 45 years with first-degree family history |journal=JAMA |volume=279 |issue=12 |pages=922–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9544766 |doi=10.1001/jama.279.12.922}}</ref>

Two autosomal dominant [[gene]]s, ''[[BRCA1]]'' and ''[[BRCA2]]'', account for most of the cases of familial breast cancer. Women who carry a harmful [[BRCA mutation]] have a 60% to 80% risk of developing breast cancer in their lifetimes.<ref name="pmid9544766"/>  Other associated malignancies include [[ovarian cancer]] and [[pancreatic cancer]]. If a mother or a sister was diagnosed breast cancer, the risk of a hereditary ''BRCA1'' or ''BRCA2'' gene mutation is about 2-fold higher than those women without a familial history. Commercial testing for ''BRCA1'' and ''BRCA2'' gene mutations has been available in most developed countries since at least 2004.

In addition to the BRCA genes associated with breast cancer, the presence of ''[[NBR2]]'', near breast cancer gene 1, has been discovered, and research into its contribution to breast cancer pathogenesis is ongoing.<ref name="Beth Elton_2007">{{cite journal |author=Emilie Auriol, Lise-Marie Billard, Frederique Magdinier, Robert Dante |title=Specific binding of the methyl binding domain protein 2 at the ''BRCA1-NBR2'' locus |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=33 |issue=13 |pages=4243–4254 |year=2005 |doi=10.1093/nar/gki729 |pmid=16052033 |pmc=1181861}}</ref>

===Other genes===
Hereditary non-[[BRCA1]] and non-[[BRCA2]] [[breast cancer|breast tumors]] (and even some sporadic
carcinomas) are believed to result from the expression of weakly penetrant but highly prevalent mutations in various genes. For instance, polymorphism has been identified in genes associated to the metabolism of estrogens and/or carcinogens ([[CYP1A1]], [[CYP1B1]], [[CYP17]], [[Cyp19|CYP19]], [[COMT]], [[NAT2]], [[GSTM1]], [[GSTP1]], GSTT, . . . ), to estrogen, androgen and vitamin D action ([[ESR1]], [[Androgen receptor|AR]], [[Vitamin D receptor|VDR]]), to co-activation of gene transcription ([[AIB1]]), to DNA damage response pathways ([[CHEK2]], HRAS1, [[XRCC1]], [[XRCC3]], [[XRCC5]]).<ref name="Lacroix2005">{{cite journal | first=M | last= Lacroix | coauthors= Leclercq, G. | title= The "portrait" of hereditary breast cancer | journal= Breast Cancer Research and Treatment | year=2005 | volume=89 |pages=297–304 | pmid= 15754129 | doi=10.1007/s10549-004-2172-4 | issue=3 | authorlink= Marc Lacroix }}</ref> Sequence variants of these genes that are relatively common in the population may be associated with a small to moderate increased relative risk for breast cancer. Combinations of such variants could lead to multiplicative effects. Sporadic cancers likely result from the complex interplay between the expression of low penetrance gene(s) (''risk variants'') and environmental factors. However, the suspected impact of most of these variants on breast cancer risk should, in most cases, be confirmed in large populations studies. Indeed, low penetrance genes cannot be easily tracked through families, as is true for dominant high-risk genes.<ref name="Lacroix2005"/>

Part of the hereditary non-[[BRCA1]] and non-[[BRCA2]] [[breast cancer|breast tumors]] may be associated to rare syndromes, of which [[breast cancer]] is only one component. Such syndromes result notably from mutations in [[TP53]] ([[Li-Fraumeni syndrome]]), ATM ([[Ataxia Telangiectasia]]), [[STK11]]/[[LKB1]]([[Peutz-Jeghers syndrome]]), [[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]] ([[Cowden syndrome]]).

RAB11FIP1,<ref>{{cite doi|10.1172/JCI37622}}</ref> TP53, PTEN and rs4973768 are also associated with increased risk of breast cancer. rs6504950 is associated with lower risk of breast cancer.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/5071129/Breast-cancer-gene-could-reduce-risk.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Breast cancer gene 'could reduce risk' | date=2009-03-30 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>

Mutations in RAD51C confer an increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Meindl A, Hellebrand H, Wiek C, ''et al.'' |title=Germline mutations in breast and ovarian cancer pedigrees establish RAD51C as a human cancer susceptibility gene |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=410–4 |year=2010 |month=May |pmid=20400964 |doi=10.1038/ng.569}}</ref>

==Prior cancers==
People who have previously been diagnosed with breast, ovarian, uterine, or bowel cancer have a higher risk of developing breast cancer in the future.<ref name=Margolese />  Mothers of children with soft-tissue sarcoma may have an increased risk of breast cancer.<ref name=Margolese />  Men with prostate cancer may have an elevated risk of breast cancer, although the [[absolute risk]] remains low.

==Dietary factors==

===Alcohol===
{{Main|Alcohol and breast cancer}}
According to the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], there is sufficient scientific evidence to classify alcoholic beverages as a [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1 carcinogen]] that causes breast cancer in women.<ref name=IARC>''Alcohol consumption and ethyl carbamate'' [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans (2007: Lyon, France) ISBN 9789283212966</ref>  Group 1 carcinogens are the substances with the clearest scientific evidence that they cause cancer, such as smoking [[tobacco]]. 

The more alcohol a woman drinks, the more likely she is to get breast cancer.<ref name=IARC />  The relationship is linear and dose-dependent.  Even low levels of alcohol consumption carry some risk.<ref name=IARC />  A study of more than one million middle-aged British women concluded that each daily alcoholic beverage increases the incidence of breast cancer by 11 cases per 1000 women.<ref name="pmid19244173">{{cite journal |author=Allen NE, Beral V, Casabonne D, ''et al.'' |title=Moderate alcohol intake and cancer incidence in women |journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=296–305 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19244173 |doi=10.1093/jnci/djn514}}</ref> This means that among a group of 1000 women who drink one alcoholic beverage per day, they will have 11 extra cases of breast cancer when compared to a group of women who drink less than one alcoholic beverage per week; a group of 1000 women who have four drinks per day will have an extra 44 cases of breast cancer compared to non-drinkers.  One or two drinks each day increases the [[relative risk]] to 150% of normal, and six drinks per day increases the risk to 330% of normal.  Approximately 6% of breast cancers reported in the UK are due to women drinking alcohol.<ref name=COC>''[http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/pdfs/alco04nontech.pdf Non-Technical Summary]'' Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food Consumer Products and the Environment (COC)</ref>

The primary mechanism through which alcohol causes breast cancer is increased estrogen levels.<ref name=Margolese />

=== Fat intake ===
Dietary influences have been examined since decades with conflicting results and so far failed to confirm any significant dependency. One recent study suggests that low-fat diets may significantly decrease the risk of breast cancer as well as the recurrence of breast cancer.<ref>{{cite journal

}}</ref>
Another study showed no contribution of dietary fat intake on the incidence of breast cancer in over 300,000 women.<ref name="pmid8538706">{{cite journal |author=Hunter DJ, Spiegelman D, Adami HO, ''et al.'' |title=Cohort studies of fat intake and the risk of breast cancer--a pooled analysis |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=334 |issue=6 |pages=356–61 |year=1996 |pmid=8538706 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199602083340603}}</ref>  A randomized controlled study of the consequences of a low-fat diet, the Women's Health Initiative, failed to show a [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] reduction in breast cancer incidence in the group assigned to a low-fat diet, although the authors did find evidence of a benefit in the subgoup of women who followed the low-fat diet in a strict manner.<ref name="pmid16467232">{{cite journal |author=Prentice RL, Caan B, Chlebowski RT, ''et al.'' |title=Low-fat dietary pattern and risk of invasive breast cancer: the Women's Health Initiative Randomized Controlled Dietary Modification Trial |journal=JAMA |volume=295 |issue=6 |pages=629–42 |year=2006 |pmid=16467232 |doi=10.1001/jama.295.6.629}}</ref> A prospective cohort study, the Nurses' Health Study II, found increased breast cancer incidence in premenopausal women only, with higher intake of animal fat, but not vegetable fat.<!--http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12865454?dopt=Citation-->
Taken as a whole, these results point to a possible association between dietary fat intake and breast cancer incidence, though these interactions are hard to measure in large groups of women.

=== Specific dietary fatty acids ===
Although many claims have been made in popular literature there is no solid evidence linking specific fats to breast cancer.

A study published in 2001 found higher levels of [[monounsaturated fatty acids]] MUFAs (especially oleic acid) in the erythrocyte membranes of postmenopausal women who developed breast cancer.<ref name=Valeria/>

That same study discussed that a diet high in MUFAs is not the major determinant of erythrocyte membrane MUFAs, where most oleic acid in mammalian tissue is derived from the saturated [[stearic acid]] residue. Where key conversion is controlled by the [[Stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase|Delta9-desaturase]], which also regulates the transformation of the other common [[saturated fatty acids]] (SFAs) (myristic and palmitic). The study discussed that fat content of the diet has an important effect on Delta9-d activity, while high levels of SFAs increase Delta9-d activity by twofold to threefold, whereas [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]] (PUFAs) decrease.<ref name=Valeria>{{cite journal |author=Pala V, Krogh V, Muti P, ''et al.'' |title=Erythrocyte membrane fatty acids and subsequent breast cancer: a prospective Italian study |journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute |volume=93 |issue=14 |pages=1088–95 |year=2001 |month=July |pmid=11459870 |doi=10.1093/jnci/93.14.1088}}</ref>

This conclusion was partially contradicted by a latter study, which showed a direct relation between very high consumption of [[omega-6 fatty acids]] (PUFAs) and breast cancer in postmenopausal women.<ref name=Sonestedt>{{cite journal | last1 = Sonestedt | first1 = Emily | last2 = Ericson | first2 = Ulrika | last3 = Gullberg | first3 = Bo | last4 = Skog | first4 = Kerstin | last5 = Olsson | first5 = Håkan | last6 = Wirf�lt | first6 = Elisabet | title = Do both heterocyclic amines and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids contribute to the incidence of breast cancer in postmenopausal women of the Malmö diet and cancer cohort? | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 123 | pages = 1637–43 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.23394 | pmid=18636564 | issue=7}}</ref>

=== Phytoestrogens ===
{{Main|Phytoestrogens#Health Risks and Benefits}}
[[Phytoestrogens]] have been extensively studied in animal and human ''in-vitro'' and epidemiological studies. Research failed to establish any noticeable benefit and some phytoestrogens may present a breast cancer risk.

The literature support the following conclusions:
# Plant estrogen intake in early adolescence may protect against breast cancer later in life.<ref name="pmid17158751">{{cite journal |author=Rice S, Whitehead SA |title=Phytoestrogens and breast cancer--promoters or protectors? |journal=Endocr. Relat. Cancer |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=995–1015 |year=2006 |pmid=17158751 |doi=10.1677/erc.1.01159}}</ref>
# The potential risks of isoflavones on breast tissue in women at high risk for breast cancer is still unclear.<ref name="pmid16985246">{{cite journal |author=Messina M, McCaskill-Stevens W, Lampe JW |title=Addressing the soy and breast cancer relationship: review, commentary, and workshop proceedings |journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute |volume=98 |issue=18 |pages=1275–84 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16985246 |doi=10.1093/jnci/djj356}}</ref>

===Calcium===
Some studies have found a relationship between calcium intake and lowered breast cancer risk.
* In the Nurse's Health Study, a high dietary intake of calcium showed 33% lower risk of breast cancer.<ref>J Natl Cancer Inst 2002; 94:1301-11</ref>
* Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort Concluded 20% lower risk of breast cancer with 1250&nbsp;mg of calcium intake.<ref>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2005; 14:2898-904</ref>
* Women's Health Study shows an inverse association between total calcium intake and premenopausal breast cancer risk.<ref>Arch Intern Med 2007; 167:1050-9</ref>
* Another two studies, one in France<ref>Ann Nutr metab 2007; 51:139-45</ref> and another in Finland,<ref>Br J Cancer 1996; 73:687-91</ref> showed significant inverse relation between  calcium intake and breast cancer.

;Hypotheses:
* Calcium reduces cell proliferation and induces differentiation in mammary glands.
* High calcium intake decreases fat-induced epithelial hypoproliferation of mammary gland and chemically induced carcinogenesis.
* Breast density is positively associated with breast cancer. Dietary calcium intake reduces the breast density.
* High calcium intake is associated with a reduced risk of benign proliferative epithelial disorders which are thought to be precursors of breast cancer.

===Vitamin D===
{{Main|Vitamin D#Role in cancer prevention and recovery}}
Vitamin D is related to reduced risk of breast cancer and disease prognosis.
A 2011 study done at the [[University of Rochester Medical Center]] found that low vitamin D levels among women with breast cancer correlate with more aggressive tumors and poorer prognosis.  The study associated sub-optimal vitamin D levels with poor scores on every major biological marker that helps physicians predict a patient's breast cancer outcome.  The lead researcher stated, "Based on these results, doctors should strongly consider monitoring vitamin D levels among breast cancer patients and correcting them as needed."<ref>
http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/index.cfm?id=3182</ref>
;Hypotheses:
* Vitamin D metabolites (25 (OH) D, 1, 25 (OH) 2 D) promote cellular differentiation and it is important for chemoprevention.
* Low circulating levels of 25 (OH) D in adolescence may be an important predisposing factor for breast cancer risk in later life.

===Brassica vegetables===
In a study published in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', biomedical investigators found that [[Brassicas]] vegetable intake (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale and Brussels sprouts) was inversely related to breast cancer development. The relative risk among women in the highest decile of Brassica vegetable consumption (median, 1.5 servings per day) compared to the lowest decile (virtually no consumption) was 0.58. That is, women who consumed around 1.5 servings of Brassica vegetables per day had 42% less risk of developing breast cancer than those who consumed virtually none.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Terry P, Wolk A, Persson I, Magnusson C |volume=285 |issue=23 |pages=2975–2976 |year=2001

 | title = Brassica Vegetables and Breast Cancer Risk |pmid=11410091 |journal=JAMA the Journal of the American Medical Association}}</ref>

===Country diet===
A significant environmental effect is likely responsible for the different rates of breast cancer incidence between countries with different dietary customs. Researchers have long measured that breast cancer rates in an immigrant population soon come to resemble the rates of the host country after a few generations. The reason for this is speculated to be immigrant uptake of the host country diet. The prototypical example of this phenomenon is the changing rate of breast cancer after the arrival of Japanese immigrants to America.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Nelson N |title = Migrant Studies Aid Search for Factors Linked to Breast Cancer Risk |journal=JAMA |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=436–438 |year=2006}}</ref>

=== Mushrooms ===
In 2009, a case-control study of the eating habits of 2,018 women suggested that women who consumed mushrooms had an approximately 50% lower incidence of [[breast cancer]]. Women who consumed mushrooms and [[green tea]] had a 90% lower incidence of breast cancer.<ref name="International Journal of Cancer 2009">

==Obesity and Lack of Exercise==
Gaining weight after menopause can increase a woman's risk. A 2006 study found that putting on 9.9&nbsp;kg (22&nbsp;lbs) after menopause increased the risk of developing breast cancer by 18%.<ref>BBC report [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5171838.stm Weight link to breast cancer risk]</ref>  Lack of exercise has been linked to breast cancer by the [[American Institute for Cancer Research]].<ref>Nelson Mya (3 November 2011)  [http://www.aicr.org/press/press-releases/getting-up-from-your-desk.html New Research: Getting Up From Your Desk Can Put the "Breaks" on Cancer.

==Hormones==
Persistently increased blood levels of [[estrogen]] are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, as are increased levels of the [[androgens]] [[androstenedione]] and [[testosterone]] (which can be directly converted by [[aromatase]] to the estrogens [[estrone]] and [[estradiol]], respectively). Increased blood levels of [[progesterone]] are associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yager JD |coauthors=Davidson NE |title=Estrogen carcinogenesis in breast cancer |journal=New Engl J Med |volume=354 |issue=3 |year=2006 |pages=270–82 |pmid=16421368 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra050776}}</ref> A number of circumstances which increase exposure to endogenous estrogens including not having children, delaying first childbirth, not breastfeeding, early [[menarche]] (the first menstrual period) and late [[menopause]] are suspected of increasing lifetime risk for developing breast cancer.<ref>American Cancer Society.

=== Hormonal contraception ===
[[Hormonal contraception|Hormonal contraceptives]] may produce a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer diagnosis among current and recent users, but this appears to be a short-term effect. In 1996 the largest collaborative reanalysis of individual data on over 150,000 women in 54 studies of breast cancer found a [[relative risk]] (RR) of 1.24 of breast cancer diagnosis among current [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] users; 10 or more years after stopping, no difference was seen. Further, the cancers diagnosed in women who had ever used hormonal contraceptives were less advanced than those in nonusers, raising the possibility that the small excess among users was due to increased detection.<!--

=== Hormone replacement therapy ===
Data exist from both observational and [[randomized clinical trial]]s regarding the association between [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|menopausal hormone replacement therapy]] (menopausal HRT) and breast cancer. The largest meta-analysis (1997) of data from 51 observational studies, indicated a relative risk of breast cancer of 1.35 for women who had used HRT for 5 or more years after menopause.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The estrogen-plus-[[progestin]] arm of the [[Women's Health Initiative]] (WHI), a randomized controlled trial, which randomized more than 16,000 postmenopausal women to receive combined hormone therapy or placebo, was halted early (2002) because health risks exceeded benefits. One of the adverse outcomes prompting closure was a significant increase in both total and invasive breast cancers ([[hazard ratio]] = 1.24) in women randomized to receive estrogen and progestin for an average of 5 years.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1001/jama.299.9.1036}}</ref> HRT-related breast cancers had adverse prognostic characteristics (more advanced stages and larger tumors) compared with cancers occurring in the placebo group, and HRT was also associated with a substantial increase in abnormal mammograms. Short-term use of hormones for treatment of menopausal symptoms appears to confer little or no breast cancer risk.<ref name=hormone/> A correlation was found between the use of hormonal contraceptives and subsequent reliance on hormone replacement therapy.<ref name="IARC 1999" />

===Oophorectomy and mastectomy===
{{Main|BRCA mutation}}
Prophylactic [[oophorectomy]] (removal of ovaries) and mastectomy in individuals with high-risk mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes reduces the risk of developing breast cancer as well as reducing the risk of developing ovarian cancer. Because of a complex balance of benefits and risks of a prophylactic surgery it is recommended only in very specific cases.

===Hormonal therapy===
{{Main|Hormonal therapy (oncology)}}
[[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|Hormonal therapy]] has been used for chemoprevention in individuals at high risk for breast cancer. Overall it is recommended only in very special circumstances. In 2002, a [[clinical practice guideline]] by the  [[US Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) recommended that "clinicians discuss chemoprevention with women at high risk for breast cancer and at low risk for adverse effects of chemoprevention" with a grade B recommendation.<ref name='USPSTF Ratings'>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/3rduspstf/ratings.htm |title=Guide to Clinical Preventive Services, Third Edition: Periodic Updates, 2000–2003 |accessdate=2007-10-07 |work=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |publisher=US Preventive Services Task Force }}</ref>{{Verify source|date=October 2007}}<ref name="pmid12093249">{{cite journal |author= |title=Chemoprevention of breast cancer: recommendations and rationale |journal=Ann.

====Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)====
The guidelines{{Clarify|date=March 2008}} were based on studies of [[Selective estrogen receptor modulator|SERM]]s from the MORE, BCPT P-1, and Italian trials.

===Endocrine disruptors===
Many [[xenoestrogen]]s (industrially made [[estrogenic]] compounds) and other [[endocrine disruptor]]s are potential risk factors of breast cancer.

[[Diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) is a synthetic form of [[estrogen]]. It has been used between the early 1940s and 1971. Pregnant women took DES to prevent certain pregnancy complications. However, it also increased their risk of breast cancer. It also increased the risk of breast cancer in the prenatally exposed daughters after they have reached an age 40 years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Palmer JR, Wise LA, Hatch EE, ''et al.'' |title=Prenatal diethylstilbestrol exposure and risk of breast cancer |journal=Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention |volume=15 |issue=8 |pages=1509–14 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16896041 |doi=10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-06-0109}}</ref>

Furthermore, there is exposure to endocrine disruptors from the environment, in addition to [[phytoestrogen]]s mentioned above in the diet section. ''See xenoestrogens in environmental factors below''

==Factors in the physical environment==
According to a review, the main mechanisms by which environmental compounds increase breast cancer risk are acting like hormones, especially estrogen, or affecting susceptibility to carcinogenesis.<ref name=brody>{{cite journal |author=Brody JG, Moysich KB, Humblet O, Attfield KR, Beehler GP, Rudel RA |title=Environmental pollutants and breast cancer: epidemiologic studies |journal=Cancer |volume=109 |issue=12 Suppl |pages=2667–711 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17503436 |doi=10.1002/cncr.22655}}</ref> The evidence to date generally supports an association between breast cancer and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs) and [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs).

===Xenoestrogens===
{{main|Xenoestrogens}}
Many [[xenoestrogen]]s (industrially made [[estrogenic]] compounds) are [[endocrine disruptor]]s, and potential risk factors of breast cancer.
Endocrine disruption is the hypothesis that some chemicals in the body, such as Bisphenol A, are capable of interfering with the production, processing, and transmission of hormones.<ref>

A substantial and growing body of evidence indicates that exposures to certain toxic chemicals and hormone-mimicking compounds including chemicals used in [[pesticides]], [[cosmetics]] and cleaning products contribute to the development of breast cancer.

The increasing prevalence of these substances in the environment may explain the increasing incidence of breast cancer, though direct evidence is sparse.

====Bisphenol A====
{{main|Bisphenol A}}
[[File:Bisphenol A.svg|thumb|right|Exposure to [[bisphenol A]] causes breast cancer.<ref name="Soto"/>]]
[[Bisphenol A]] (BPA) is a chemical compound used in the production of plastics found in numerous commercial products, including laptops, baby bottles, food containers, water main pipes, and laboratory and hospital equipment.  BPA was first produced in 1891, but its estrogenic properties went undiscovered until the mid-1930s.  Today it is considered a [[xenoestrogen]], and it functions as an endocrine disruptor that interferes with hormones in the body and disrupts the normal functioning of the endocrine system.  At very low levels the FDA has long considered BPA in food to be safe, but this has been challenged over the years as more information is discovered regarding the effects of the chemical.<ref>

Rats exposed prenatally to environmentally relevant doses of BPA show an increased number of intraductal hyperplasias (precancerious lesions) in mammary glands that appear during adulthood, while high doses induce the development of carcinomas in breast tissue.  Animals exposed to BPA during fetal life develop palpable tumors, and all studies show an increased susceptibility to mammary gland neoplasia that manifests during adulthood.  Exposure of mouse dams to environmentally relevant levels of BPA during organogenesis results in considerable alterations in the mammary gland.  It was concluded that perinatal exposure to low doses of BPA results in altered mammary gland morphogenesis, induction of precancerous lesions, and carcinoma in situ.<ref name="Soto">

A study sought to determine whether early exposure to BPA could accelerate mammary carcinogenesis in a dimethylbenzanthracene  (DMBA) model of rodent mammary cancer. In the study, scientists exposed neonatal/prebubertal rats to BPA via lactation from nursing dams treated orally with 0, 25, and 250&nbsp;µg BPA/kg body weight/day.  For tumorigenesis studies, female offspring were exposed to 30&nbsp;mg dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)/kg body weight at 50 days of age.  DMBA induces mammary tumors and allows chemicals that predispose for mammary cancer to increase the number of mammary adenocarcinomas.  The results of the study showed that female rats in the control, BPA 25, and BPA 250 groups administered DMBA exhibited a BPA dose-dependent increase in mammary tumors.  The groups had 2.84, 3.82, and 5.00 mammary tumors per rat respectively.  Treatment with BPA also reduced tumor latency, with the median tumor latency of 65, 53, and 56.5 days for 0, BPA 25, and BPA 250 groups respectively.  Maternal exposure to BPA during lactation decreased time to first tumor latency and increased the number of DMBA-induced mammary tumors in female offspring.  If these effects found in rodents carry over to humans, even minimal exposure to BPA could cause an increased risk for breast cancer.<ref>

The elevated incidence of breast cancer in women has been associated with prolonged exposure to high levels of estrogens.  Xenoestrogens, such as BPA have the capacity to perturb normal hormonal actions.  This study provides evidence of the estrogenic effects of BPA.  In this study the human breast epithelial cells MCF-10F were treated with 10-3 M, 10-4 M, 10-5 M and 10-6 M BPA continuously for two weeks.  The cells treated with 10-3 M BPA died on the second day of treatment.  The concentration of 10-4 M BPA was also toxic for the breast epithelial cells, and they died on the fourth day of treatment.  This data indicated that these concentrations of BPA are toxic for MCF-10F cells.  After the two-week observation period it was seen that the cells formed a high percentage of duct like structures in collagen.  MCF-10F cells treated with 10-5 M and 10-6 M BPA formed a high percentage of solid masses, 27% and 20% respectively.  This data indicates that BPA is able to induce neoplastic transformation of human breast epithelial cells.  Epigenetic changes are involved in the early stages of cancer initiation by altering ductulogenesis.  BPA was able to induce transformation of human breast MCF-10F epithelial cells.  After treatment with BPA, the cells produced fewer collagen tubules and more solid masses.<ref>

===Aromatic Amines===
[[Aromatic amine]]s are chemicals that are produced when products such as dyes, polyurethane products, and certain pesticides are made. They are also found in cigarette smoke, fuel exhaust, and in over cooked, burned meat. The three types of aromatic amines monocyclic, polycyclic, and heterocyclic have all been found in recent studies of breast health. Monocyclic amines have been found to cause mammary cancer in rats. Studies have shown that women who eat higher amounts of overcooked meat, meaning more exposure to heterocyclic amines, have also been diagnosed with more post-menopausal breast cancer. Heterocyclic amines also have the ability to copy estrogen and in laboratory studies have been found to encourage the growth of cancerous tumors on human tissue.<ref name="ReferenceA">State of the Evidence, The Connection Between Breast Cancer and the Environment, 2008</ref>

===Benzene===
[[File:Benzene-2D-full.svg|thumb|right|Multiple studies point to a correlation between benzene exposure and breast cancer risk.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>]]
[[Benzene]] is a petrochemical solvent. Benzene exposure mostly originates from air pollution resulting from industrial burning, exhaust and gas fumes, as well as cigarette smoke.  Petroleum, its distillates such as gasoline, auto and truck exhausts also contain benzene. The International Agency for Research on Cancer and the National Toxicology Program have labeled benzene as a definite human carcinogen. Multiple studies point to a correlation between benzene exposure and breast cancer risk. Laboratory studies on mice have shown that a high level of benzene exposure can lead to mammary cancer.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Ethylene oxide===
[[Ethylene oxide]] is a chemical that can be found in some personal care products, mainly in the form of fragrance. It is also used for the sterilization of various medical objects. The National Toxicology Program has labeled ethylene oxide as a definite human and animal carcinogen. A study done by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health including 7,576 women found a direct correlation between breast cancer rates and exposure to ethylene oxide during medical sterilization processes. Also, human breast cells put into contact with small amounts of ethylene oxide in a laboratory can lead to DNA damage of the breast tissue.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons===
[[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] are chemical products of combustion from coal burners, fuel, cigarette smoke, and various other sources. PAH's are often found in the air and are breathed into the body. PAH's bioaccumulate easily and can copy the estrogen hormone. PAH's can also be genotoxic, meaning they have the ability to harm DNA.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Vinyl chloride===
[[Vinyl chloride]] is produced when PVC or polyvinyl chloride is made. PVC is found in plastic packaging,  outerwear, plastic toys and other plastic products. Vinyl chloride can be found in cigarette smoke and the air around garbage and land fills. It can also be found in the wastewater when PVC is made. The National Toxicology Program and the International Agency for Research on Cancer have both labeled vinyl chloride as a definite human carcinogen.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Tobacco===
{{See also|Women and smoking#Unique gender differences and health effects for Females}}
Until recently, most studies had not found an increased risk of breast cancer from active [[tobacco smoking]]. Beginning in the mid-1990s, a number of studies suggested an increased risk of breast cancer in both active smokers and those exposed to [[passive smoking|secondhand smoke]] compared to women who reported no exposure to secondhand smoke.<ref name="acs bc facts 2005-6"/>  By 2005 enough evidence had accumulated for the [California Environmental Protection Agency] to conclude that breathing [[secondhand smoke]] causes breast cancer in younger, primarily premenopausal women.<ref name="calepa2005">[http://repositories.cdlib.org/context/tc/article/1194/type/pdf/viewcontent/ California Environmental Protection Agency: Air Resources Board, "Proposed Identification of Environmental Tobacco Smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant" (June 24, 2005)]; on January 26, 2006, the Air Resources Board, following a lengthy review and public outreach process, determined ETS to be a Toxic Air Contaminant (TAC).</ref> The Agency concluded that the risk was increased by 70%, based on epidemiological studies and the fact that there are many mammary carcinogens in secondhand smoke. The following year (2006) the US [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]]<ref name="surgeongeneral.gov">[http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/secondhandsmoke/ U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. "The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General", 2006]</ref> identified the same risk increase and concluded that the evidence is "suggestive," one step below causal. There is some evidence that exposure to tobacco smoke is most problematic between puberty and first childbirth. The reason is that breast tissue appears most sensitive to chemical carcinogens breast cells not fully differentiated until lactation.<ref name="ReferenceB">J. Russo, I. Russo. "Molecular Basis of Breast Cancer: Prevention and Treatment," Springer, 2003</ref>  The likely reason that the older studies of active smoking did not detect risks associated with smoking was that they compared active smokers to all nonsmokers (which includes many passive smokers). The newer studies, which exclude passive smokers from the control group, generally show elevated risks associated with active as well as passive smoking.

====Passive smoking====
Breathing [[secondhand smoke]] increases breast cancer risk by 70% in younger, primarily pre-menopausal women. The [[California Environmental Protection Agency]] has concluded that [[passive smoking]] causes breast cancer<ref name="calepa2005"/> and the US Surgeon General<ref name="surgeongeneral.gov"/> has concluded that the evidence is "suggestive," one step below causal. There is some evidence that exposure to tobacco smoke is most problematic between puberty and first childbirth. The reason that breast tissue appears most sensitive to chemical carcinogens in this phase is that breast cells are not fully differentiated until lactation.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

===Radiation===
Women who have received high-dose [[ionizing radiation]] to the chest (for example, as treatments for other cancers) have a relative risk of breast cancer between 2.1 to 4.0.<!--

In addition, the risk is higher in women irradiated before age 30, when there is still breast development.<ref name=robbins/>

===Dioxins===
[[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|Dioxins]] (most notably the [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins]]) are chemicals that are produced when chlorinated products are burned, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC). This occurs when chlorinated products are used in certain manufacturing industries. Dioxins are also added to the air when gasoline and diesel fuels break down. Dioxins are able to bioaccumulate, meaning that they settle and stay in human and animal fat for long periods of time. There are many different types of dioxins and only a few of them have been labeled by the Environmental Protection Agency as definite human carcinogens and endocrine hormone disruptors. Although dioxins are floating in the air, they eventually settle on plants and other vegetation surfaces. These plants and vegetation are them eaten by cows and other animals. Humans end up eating the produce, milk, eggs, and meat produced by these animals that have consumed dioxin covered vegetation. Dioxins are more harmful when ingested this way. Multiple studies have led to the idea that increased dioxin levels can increase one's risk for breast cancer. A study done in 1976 after a chemical plant explosion in Seveso, Italy concluded that high dioxin level exposure in a woman's body correlated with a more than double chance of developing breast cancer.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Light at night and disturbance of circadian rhythm===
In 1978 Cohen et al. proposed that reduced production of the hormone melatonin might increase the risk of breast cancer and citing  "environmental lighting" as a possible causal factor.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cohen M, Lippman M, Chabner B |title=Role of pineal gland in aetiology and treatment of breast cancer |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8094 |pages=814–6 |year=1978 |month=October |pmid=81365 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(78)92591-6}}</ref> Researchers at the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) and [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] conducted a study in 2005 that suggests that artificial light during the night can be a factor for breast cancer by disrupting [[melatonin]] levels.<ref name="Blask">{{cite journal |author=Blask DE, Brainard GC, Dauchy RT, ''et al.'' |title=Melatonin-depleted blood from premenopausal women exposed to light at night stimulates growth of human breast cancer xenografts in nude rats |journal=Cancer Research |volume=65 |issue=23 |pages=11174–84 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16322268 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1945}}</ref>

In 2007, "shiftwork that involves circadian disruption" was listed as a probable carcinogen by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer.

==Racial and socioeconomic factors==
Incidence and mortality vary with race and social status. Incidence rises with improving economic situation, while mortality is tied to low economic status. In the US incidence is significantly lower and mortality higher among black women and this difference appears to persist even after adjustment for economic status. It is currently unclear if significant racial differences in incidence and mortality persist after adjustment for economic status between women of white, Hispanic and Asian origin in the US.<ref name=Vainshtein_2008>{{cite pmid|18672561}}</ref>

Several studies have found that black women in the U.S. are more likely to die from breast cancer even though white women are more likely to be diagnosed with the disease. Even after diagnosis, black women are less likely to get treatment compared to white women.<ref>''[http://dhfs.wisconsin.gov/wcrs/pdf/cancerwi0004.pdf Wisconsin Cancer Incidence and Mortality, 2000–2004]'' Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services</ref><ref name="pmid17218849">{{Cite journal|author=Tammemagi CM |title=Racial/ethnic disparities in breast and gynecologic cancer treatment and outcomes |journal=Curr.

==Factors with inconclusive research==

===Tea===
One research published in 2009 has show that moderate green or black tea consumption (three or more cups per day) can reduce breast cancer risk by 37% in women younger than 50 years old, comparing with women who drank no tea at all. But no association was found for overall women.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kumar N, Titus-Ernstoff L, Newcomb PA, Trentham-Dietz A, Anic G, Egan KM |title=Tea consumption and risk of breast cancer |journal=Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=341–5 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19124518 |doi=10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-08-0819}}</ref> However that study has been criticized for inaccuracy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/news/2009/01January/Pages/Teaandbreastcancer.aspx|title=Breast cancer: weak tea study|date=January 22, 2009|accessdate=2009-01-22}}</ref> and another study found no substantial association between breast cancer and tea consumption in the overall, but found a weak inverse association between caffeine-containing beverages and risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ganmaa D, Willett WC, Li TY, ''et al.'' |title=Coffee, tea, caffeine and risk of breast cancer: a 22-year follow-up |journal=International Journal of Cancer.

===1,3-Butadiene===
[[1,3-Butadiene]] is an environmental factor that can be found in air pollution and can be produced by combustion engines, as well as petroleum refineries. It is found in cigarette smoke and is also used in the making and processing of certain synthetic rubber products and fungicides. The National Toxicology Program has labeled 1,3-Butadiene as definite human carcinogen. The EPA has stated that people are mainly put in contact with this chemical through the means of simple inhalation.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Mammographic density===
Mammographic density refers to the relative proportions of radiodense area compared to the radiolucent area on a mammogram, which is basically an [[x-ray]] of the breast. The radiodense area on a mammogram is white and is associated with ductal and lobular epithelium, connective tissue and fluid in the [[breast]]. The radiolucent area is dark gray or black and is associated with fat in the breast. High mammographic density is associated with a higher risk of developing [[breast cancer]], but the reasons for this link are not certain and are being studied.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gierach|first=Gretchen L. |date=April 19, 2010|title=Relationship of mammographic density with breast cancer subtypes|url=http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?sKey=6c872330-0604-4fc5-b486-6557d8ec1e5c&cKey=f0a2756e-0a22-48f3-ac30-e864d3fbedec&mKey={0591FA3B-AFEF-49D2-8E65-55F41EE8117E}|laysummary=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100421102338.htm}}</ref><ref>[http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=50517&PageTemplateID=295 Breast Density Change Linked to Cancer Development in WHI Hormone Replacement Study]</ref>

===Deodorants===
Much has been made of the possible contribution of aluminum-containing underarm antiperspirants to the incidence of breast cancer, since the most common location of a breast cancer is the upper outer quadrant of the breast. [[Aluminum]] salts, such as those used in anti-perspirants, have recently been classified as [[metalloestrogen]]s. In research published in the ''[[Journal of Applied Toxicology]]'', Dr. Philippa D. Darbre of the [[University of Reading]] has shown that aluminum salts increase estrogen-related gene expression in human breast cancer cells grown in the laboratory.<ref>Harding, Anne.

=== Folic acid (folate) ===
{{Main|Folic acid#Cancer}}
The results of the studies about the influence of dietary folic acid on breast cancer have been contradictory.

===Viruses===
Several kind of viruses are suspected to play a role or cause breast cancer, among them [[human papilloma virus]],<ref name=Heng_2009>{{cite pmid|19724278}}</ref> [[human cytomegalovirus]]<ref>{{cite pmid|21429243}}</ref> and the [[Epstein-Barr virus]].<ref name=Lawson_2006>{{cite pmid|17661684}}</ref> The human papilloma virus is well known for its capability to immortalize breast cancer cells which is used in research, however the role of this viruses in human breast cancer remains controversial.

Humans are not the only mammals susceptible to breast cancer. Some strains of mice, namely the house mouse (Mus domesticus) are prone to breast cancer which is caused by infection with the [[mouse mammary tumour virus]] (MMTV or "Bittner virus" for its discoverer Hans Bittner), by random insertional mutagenesis. This finding is taken to mean that a viral origin of human breast cancer is at least possible, though there is no definitive evidence to support the claim that MMTV causes human breast cancer. For example, there may be critical differences between cancer pathogenesis in mice and people. 
A human homologue of the mammary virus has been described in 1971 and linked to human breast cancer in several small epidemiologic studies.<ref name="Lawson_2001">{{cite pmid|11250750}}</ref><ref name="Taneja_2009">{{cite pmid|19580428}}</ref>

==History==
In past centuries, the development of breast cancer was most commonly seen as [[divine punishment]] or a trial.  From ancient Greek medicine until the end of the 17th century, the dominant medical explanation was an imbalance of the [[four humors]].<ref name="isbn0-679-43459-3" />  By the start of the 18th century, humoralism had generally been rejected.  Many other theories were put forward, often related to sexual activity:  In 1713, [[Bernardino Ramazzini]] said that nuns developed breast cancer at a higher rate than married women because they did not engage in [[sexual intercourse]], and the "unnatural" lack of sexual activity caused instability of the breasts; others countered that the cause was frequently too much sexual activity.<ref name="isbn0-8018-6936-6">{{cite book
