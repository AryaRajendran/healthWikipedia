An '''elective'''<ref group="note">Sometimes known by other names, such as a ''Subject to Endorsement Placement'' (StEP) at [[Manchester Medical School]].</ref><ref name=manchester>{{cite web|title=Course description|url=http://www.medicine.manchester.ac.uk/undergraduate/medicine/coursedetails/?code=01428&pg=2|publisher=University of Manchester|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref>  is a placement undertaken as part of a [[medical degree]]. The content and setting of the placement are largely decided by the student undertaking it,<ref name=hospdoc>{{cite web|last=Broad|first=Mike|title=Going on medical elective: a guide for students|url=http://www.hospitaldr.co.uk/guidance/going-on-medical-elective-a-guide-for-students|publisher=Hospital Dr|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref> hence the name.

Elective placements are not exclusive to medical degrees; many other degree programmes within the field of healthcare also incorporate electives (such as [[nursing]], [[dentistry]] and [[physiotherapy]]) and the format is often the same, but they are not discussed in detail here.

==Motivations==

An elective represents a unique opportunity for [[medical students]], allowing them to experience [[healthcare]] in a setting unfamiliar to that in which they are accustomed to studying,<ref name="manchester"/> and also provides the opportunity for medical students to develop their skills by observing and participating in healthcare overseas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medics Away elective page|url=http://www.medicsaway.co.uk/index.php/travel/electives/|publisher=Medics Away|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref>  Classically, students embark on elective placements abroad, often in the [[developing world]], or other countries where scientific, social, economic or cultural standards differ from those found in the country where the student's [[medical school]] is situated.<ref name="manchester"/> However, as electives can be expensive, some students opt for elective placements in the same country as their university.<ref name="hospdoc"/>

Aside from providing experience of differing practices, electives also allow students to encounter medical conditions they are less used to seeing at home.<ref group="note">For example, certain [[infectious diseases]] that are uncommon in the [[Western world]].</ref> In addition, students often retrospectively describe how their placements broadened their horizons with regards to the social issues affecting healthcare in developing countries.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gordonweeks|first=Alex|title=India Elective, 2005|url=http://www.yoracle.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=303&Itemid=11&mosmsg=Thanks+for+your+vote!|publisher=Yoracle|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref>

==Structure and organisation==
An elective is usually undertaken in the penultimate or final year of study of a medical degree, often after students have finished their final exams.<ref name="hospdoc"/> The university usually specifies the dates during which an elective can be undertaken by students.<ref name=BMJ>{{cite web|title=Funding your elective|url=http://student.bmj.com/student/view-article.html?id=sbmj.d5851|publisher=Student BMJ|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref>

Electives can be entirely self-arranged, but this can be complicated, as it requires the student to organise travel, accommodation, the placement itself, and other legalities such as travel insurance and indemnity cover themselves. Because of this, many students recruit the services of companies which specialise in organising medical electives and will take care of most of the arrangements for the placement.<ref name="hospdoc"/> Students often share their experiences on the internet,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Electives Network|url=http://www.electives.net|publisher=TEN|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref> and good placements become well-known. Popular destinations fill up as much as 12 months in advance, and as such students will often make bookings with elective companies up to 18 months before the start date of their placement.<ref name="BMJ"/>

===Cost===

Medical electives can be extremely expensive, with the overall cost often running into thousands of [[Pound sterling|pounds]]. Most students fund their electives personally, but financial help is occasionally available in the forms of <ref>[http://www.worktheworld.co.uk/blog/2011/11/02/money-money-money-how-to-get-funds-for-your-elective?category=Financing+Your+Placement]</ref> bursaries, prizes or scholarships, either from the student's university or from societies or private companies. In these cases, the sponsor will typically require that the student undertakes some form of project whilst on their elective to justify the expense.<ref name="BMJ"/>

==Requirements==
Requirements of students vary from medical school to medical school. Some (such as [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine|Aberdeen]]) require students to submit a written project as part of their placement, whereas other institutions utilise few formal assessments.<ref name="BMJ"/>

In terms of conduct whilst on the placement, students are expected to behave as they would in their home institution. It is illegal for unregistered medical students to act as doctors, despite the fact that their level of skill and expertise is often comparable to the professionals they will work with on the placement.<ref name="hospdoc"/> Notably, students are still subject to all the ethical and professional requirements they would be at their home institution, such as the [[General Medical Council|GMC]]'s requirement that students in the [[United Kingdom]] "recognise and work within the limits of their competence".<ref name=GMC>{{cite web|title=Good Medical Practice: Duties of a doctor|url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/good_medical_practice/duties_of_a_doctor.asp|work=Good Medical Practice|publisher=General Medical Council|accessdate=2012-05-23}}</ref>
