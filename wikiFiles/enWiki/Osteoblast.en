'''Osteoblasts''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words for "[[bone]]" and "germ" or embryonic) are mononucleate [[cell (biology)|cell]]s that are responsible for bone formation; in essence, osteoblasts are specialized [[fibroblast]]s that in addition to fibroblastic products, express [[bone sialoprotein]] and [[osteocalcin]].<ref name="Salentijn">Salentijn, L. ''Biology of Mineralized Tissues: Cartilage and Bone'', [[Columbia University College of Dental Medicine]] post-graduate dental lecture series, 2007</ref>

Osteoblasts produce a matrix of [[osteoid]], which is composed mainly of Type I collagen.  Osteoblasts are also responsible for mineralization of this matrix. Zinc, copper and sodium are some of the minerals required in this process. Bone is a dynamic tissue that is constantly being reshaped by osteoblasts, which are in charge of production of matrix and mineral, and [[osteoclasts]], which break down the tissue. The number of osteoblasts tends to decrease with age, affecting the balance of formation and resorption in the [[bone tissue]],<ref name=Dippolito1999>{{cite journal|author = D’ippolito, Gianluca|coauthors = Schiller, Paul C.; Ricordi, Camillo; Roos, Bernard A.; Howard, Guy A.|year = 1999|title = Age-Related Osteogenic Potential of Mesenchymal Stromal Stem Cells from Human Vertebral Bone Marrow|journal = Journal of Bone and Mineral Research|volume = 14|issue = 7|pages = 1115–1122|doi = 10.1359/jbmr.1999.14.7.1115|pmid = 10404011}}</ref> and potentially leading to [[osteoporosis]].

==Osteogenesis==
Osteoblasts arise from '''osteoprogenitor cells''' located in the deeper layer of [[periosteum]] and the [[bone marrow]]. Osteoprogenitors are immature [[progenitor cell]]s that express the master regulatory [[transcription factor]] [[Cbfa1|Cbfa1/Runx2]]. 

Osteoprogenitors are induced to differentiate under the influence of [[growth factor]]s, in particular the '''[[bone morphogenetic protein]]s''' (BMPs).<ref name="Agata, H. 2007">{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/154405910708600113|last1=Agata|first1=H|last2=Asahina|first2=I|last3=Yamazaki|first3=Y|last4=Uchida|first4=M|last5=Shinohara|first5=Y|last6=Honda|first6=MJ|last7=Kagami|first7=H|last8=Ueda|first8=M|title=Effective bone engineering with periosteum-derived cells.|journal=Journal of dental research|volume=86|issue=1|pages=79–83|year=2007|pmid=17189468}}</ref> Aside from BMPs, other growth factors including fibroblast growth factor (FGF),<ref name="Agata, H. 2007"/> [[platelet-derived growth factor]] (PDGF) and [[transforming growth factor|transforming growth factor beta]] (TGF-β) may promote the division of osteoprogenitors and potentially increase osteogenesis.[[Bone morphogenetic protein 4|BMP4]] and [[Basic fibroblast growth factor|FGF2]] have been experimentally shown to increase osteoblast differentiation.<ref>{{cite pmid|23206696}}</ref>

Once osteoprogenitors start to differentiate into osteoblasts, they begin to express a range of genetic markers including [[Osterix]], [[collagen|Col1]],<ref name="Ringe, J. 2008">{{cite journal|last1=Ringe|first1=J|last2=Leinhase|first2=I|last3=Stich|first3=S|last4=Loch|first4=A|last5=Neumann|first5=K|last6=Haisch|first6=A|last7=Häupl|first7=T|last8=Manz|first8=R|last9=Kaps|first9=C|title=Human mastoid periosteum-derived stem cells: promising candidates for skeletal tissue engineering.|journal=Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=136–46|year=2008|pmid=18383554|doi=10.1002/term.75}}</ref> [[Bone sialoprotein|BSP]], [[Macrophage colony-stimulating factor|M-CSF]], [[alkaline phosphatase|ALP]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Szulc|first1=P|last2=Garnero|first2=P|last3=Marchand|first3=F|last4=Duboeuf|first4=F|last5=Delmas|first5=PD|title=Biochemical markers of bone formation reflect endosteal bone loss in elderly men--MINOS study.|journal=Bone|volume=36|issue=1|pages=13–21|year=2005|pmid=15663998|doi=10.1016/j.bone.2004.09.004}}</ref> [[osteocalcin]],<ref name="Ringe, J. 2008"/> [[osteopontin]], and [[osteonectin]]. Although the term osteoblast implies an immature cell type, osteoblasts are in fact the mature bone cells entirely responsible for generating bone tissue in animals and humans.

==Morphology and histological staining==

[[H&E stain|Hematoxylin and eosin staining]], or H&E staining, reveals that the cytoplasm of osteoblasts is [[basophilic]] due to the presence of a large amount of [[Endoplasmic reticulum#Rough endoplasmic reticulum|rough endoplasmic reticulum]]. The nucleus is spherical and large. An active osteoblast is characterized morphologically by a prominent [[Golgi apparatus]] that appears histologically as a clear zone adjacent to the nucleus. Active osteoblasts [[Chemical synthesis|synthesize]], and stain positively for, [[Type-I collagen]] and [[alkaline phosphatase]].

==Osteoblasts and osteocytes==
{{main|osteocyte}}

Osteoblasts that become trapped in the bone matrix and remain isolated in lacunae become [[osteocyte]]s. They cease to generate osteoid and mineralized matrix, and instead act in a [[paracrine]] manner on active osteoblasts. They are believed to respond to mechanosensory stimuli.<ref name=Ehrlich2002>{{cite journal|author = Ehrlich, P. J.|coauthors = Lanyon, L.
