In [[anatomy]], the '''G cell''' is a type of cell in the stomach that secretes [[gastrin]]. It works in conjunction with [[gastric chief cell]]s and [[parietal cells]].

G cells are found deep within the [[gastric glands]] of the [[stomach]] [[antrum]], and occasionally in the [[pancreas]].<ref>{{Medcyclopaedia|iv_1/g/G_cell}}</ref>

The [[vagus nerve]] innervates the G cells. 

[[Gastrin-releasing peptide]] is released by the post-ganglionic fibers of the vagus nerve onto G cells during [[parasympathetic]] stimulation. The peptide hormone [[bombesin]] also stimulates gastrin release from G cells.  

Gastrin-releasing peptide, as well as the presence of [[amino acids]] in the stomach, stimulates the release of gastrin from the G cells. Gastrin stimulates [[enterochromaffin-like cell]]s to release [[histamine]].<ref>{{Cite book| edition = 11| publisher = Elsevier Saunders| isbn = 0-7216-0240-1| page = 797| last = Guyton| first = Arthur C.| coauthors = John E.

Gastrin also targets [[parietal cell]]s by increasing the amount of histamine and the direct stimulation by gastrin, causing the parietal cells to increase [[Hydrochloric acid|HCl]] secretion in the stomach.

G cell have a distinctive microscopic appearance that allows one to separate them from other cells in the gastric antrum; their nucleus is centrally located in the cell and the cytoplasm is clear.  They are found in the mid portion of the [[gastric glands]]
