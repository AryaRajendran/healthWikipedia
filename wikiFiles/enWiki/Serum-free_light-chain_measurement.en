Measurement of [[immunoglobulin]]-free light chains in serum has recently become possible. These tests are used as an aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of [[multiple myeloma]] and related disorders. There are two types of immunoglobulin light chain produced in humans, designated by the Greek letters kappa (κ) and lambda (λ). Comparing the ratio of kappa-to-lambda free-light chains in the serum of an individual with that measured in a number of subjects known to be disease-free indicates whether the individual might have a [[plasma cell]] tumour such as multiple myeloma or [[AL amyloidosis]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Bradwell AR, Carr-Smith HD, Mead GP, ''et al.'' |title=Highly sensitive, automated immunoassay for immunoglobulin free light chains in serum and urine |journal=Clinical Chemistry |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=673–80 |date=1 April 2001|pmid=11274017 |url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11274017 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Katzmann JA, Clark RJ, Abraham RS, ''et al.'' |title=Serum reference intervals and diagnostic ranges for free kappa and free lambda immunoglobulin light chains: relative sensitivity for detection of monoclonal light chains |journal=Clinical Chemistry |volume=48 |issue=9 |pages=1437–44 |date=1 September 2002|pmid=12194920 |url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12194920 }}</ref>

==Structure==
Each immunoglobulin light-chain molecule contains approximately 220 amino acids in a single polypeptide chain that is folded to form constant and variable region domains.
Each domain comprises two [[Beta sheet|β-pleated sheets]]. The sheets are linked by a disulfide bridge and together form a roughly barrel-shaped structure known as a [[Beta barrel|β-barrel]].
The variable (V) domain of light chains has a high degree of structural diversity, particularly the antigen-binding region. In addition, the first 23 amino acids of the 1st variable domain framework region have a number of variations known as subgroups. Four kappa (Vκ1–Vκ4) and six lambda subgroups (Vλ1–Vλ6) can be identified.<ref name=Solomon>{{Cite journal|author=Solomon A |title=Light chains of human immunoglobulins |journal=Methods in Enzymology |volume=116 |pages=101–21 |year=1985 |pmid=3937021 |doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(85)16008-8|series=Methods in Enzymology|isbn=978-0-12-182016-9}}</ref> The specific subgroup structures influence the potential of the free light chains to polymerise such that AL amyloidosis is associated with Vλ6 and light-chain deposition disease with Vκ1 and Vκ4.

==Synthesis==
Kappa light-chain molecules are constructed from approximately 40 functional Vκ gene segments (chromosome 2), five Jκ gene segments and a single Cκ gene. Lambda molecules (chromosome 22) are constructed from about 30 Vλ gene segments and four pairs of functional Jλ gene segments and a Cλ gene.<ref>Janeway CA, Travers P, Walport M, Slomchik MJ, “Immunobiology; the immune system in health and disease” (2005); Garland Science publishing.

Light chains are incorporated into immunoglobulin molecules during [[B-cell]] development and are expressed initially on the surface of pre B-cells. Production of light chains occurs throughout the rest of B-cell development and in plasma cells, where secretion is highest.

==Production==
The production of free immunoglobulin light chains in normal individuals is approximately 500&nbsp;mg/day from bone marrow and lymph node cells.<ref name="Solomon"/><ref name=Waldman>{{Cite journal|author=Waldmann TA, Strober W, Mogielnicki RP |title=The renal handling of low molecular weight proteins: II.

==Metabolism==
In normal individuals, free light chains are rapidly cleared from the blood and catabolised by the kidneys. Monomeric free light chains are cleared in 2–4 hours, and dimeric light chains in 3–6 hours. Removal may be prolonged to 2–3 days in people with complete renal failure.<ref name="Solomon"/><ref name="Waldman"/><ref name=Miettinen>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/0009-8981(67)90036-8 |title=Effect of impaired hepatic and renal function on [131]bence jones protein catabolism in human subjects |year=1967 |author=Miettinen, T |journal=Clinica Chimica Acta |volume=18 |pages=395 |last2=Kekki |first2=M|issue=3}}</ref> Human kidneys are composed of approximately half a million [[nephrons]].

If immunoglobulin light chains are produced in sufficient amounts to overwhelm the proximal tubules’ absorption mechanisms (usually due to the presence of a plasma cell tumour) the light chains enter the distal tubules and can appear in the urine. The passage of large amounts of immunoglobulin light chains through the kidneys may cause inflammation or blockage of the kidney tubules.

The [[Distal convoluted tubule|distal tubules]] of the kidneys secrete large amounts of uromucoid ([[Tamm–Horsfall protein]]). This is the dominant protein in normal urine and is thought to be important in preventing ascending urinary infections. It is a relatively small glycoprotein (80kDa) that aggregates into [[polymers]] of 20–30 molecules. It contains a short amino-acid sequence that can specifically bind to some free light chains.<ref name=Ying>{{Cite journal|author=Ying WZ, Sanders PW |title=Mapping the Binding Domain of Immunoglobulin Light Chains for Tamm-Horsfall Protein |journal=The American Journal of Pathology |volume=158 |issue=5 |pages=1859–66 |date=1 May 2001|pmid=11337384 |pmc=1891942 |url=http://ajp.amjpathol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11337384|doi=10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64142-9 }}</ref> Together they can form an insoluble precipitate which  blocks the distal part of the nephrons.

==Guidelines==
The International Myeloma Working Group have recently published guidelines making recommendations of when serum free light-chain analysis should be used in the management of multiple myeloma.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Dispenzieri A, Kyle R, Merlini G, ''et al.'' |title=International Myeloma Working Group guidelines for serum-free light-chain analysis in multiple myeloma and related disorders |journal=Leukemia |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=215–24 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19020545 |doi=10.1038/leu.2008.307}}</ref>

===Diagnosis===
The serum free light-chain assay in combination with [[serum protein electrophoresis]] and serum immunofixation electrophoresis is sufficient to screen for pathological monoclonal plasmaproliferative disorders other than AL amyloidosis which requires all the serum tests as well as 24 h urine immunofixation electrophoresis.

===Prognosis===
The serum free light-chain assay should be measured at diagnosis for all patients with MGUS, smoldering or active multiple myeloma. Solitary plasmacytoma and AL amyloidosis.

===Monitoring===
Serial FLC ascertainment should be routinely performed in patients with AL amyloidosis and multiple myeloma patients with oligosecretory disease.  It should also be done in all patients who have achieved a complete response to determine whether they have attained a stringent complete response.
