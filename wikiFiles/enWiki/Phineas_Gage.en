Gage's parents were Jesse Eaton Gage and Hannah Trussell (''n√©e'' Swet&shy;land, Sweat&shy;land, or Sweet&shy;land) Gage (Mac&shy;millan 2000, pp.&nbsp;490&ndash;1),

<p>
Gage's death and burial are discussed at Mac&shy;millan (2000), p.&nbsp;108.
Harlow is ''exactly'' one year off in the date of Gage's death, implying that certain other dates given by Harlow for events late in Gage's life&mdash;his move from Chile to San Francisco and the onset of his con&shy;vul&shy;sions&mdash;must also be mistaken, presumably by the same amount; this article follows Mac&shy;millan in correcting those dates.

Gage is a fixture in the curricula of [[neurology]], [[psychology]] and [[Portal:neuroscience|related disciplines]], and is freq&shy;uent&shy;ly mentioned in books and academic papers; he even has a minor place in pop&shy;u&shy;lar culture.<ref group="upper-alpha">{{cite journal | author = LeUnes,&nbsp;A. | year = 1974 | title = Contributions to the history of psychology: 20.

Despite this celebrity the body of established fact about Gage and what he was like (whether before or after his accident) is remarkably small, which has allowed "the fitting of almost any theory to the small number of facts we have"<ref name="fitting"/>&mdash;Gage having been cited, over the years, by proponents of various theories of the brain wholly con&shy;tra&shy;dic&shy;to&shy;ry to one another.
A survey of published accounts of Gage, including scientific ones, has found that they are almost always severely distorted&mdash;exaggerating the known facts when not directly con&shy;tra&shy;dict&shy;ing them.

A [[daguerreotype]] portrait of Gage&mdash;"handsome&nbsp;... well dressed and confident, even proud," and holding the tamping iron which injured him&mdash;was identified in 2009.
One re&shy;search&shy;er points to it as con&shy;sistent with a ''social recovery'' hypothesis, under which Gage's most serious mental changes may have existed for only a limited time after the accident, so that in later life he was far more functional, and socially far better adapted, than pre&shy;vi&shy;ously thought.
A second portrait ([[#otherportrait|see below]]) came to light in 2010.

On September 13, 1848 twenty-five-year-old Gage was foreman of a work gang [[Rock blasting|blasting]] rock while preparing the road&shy;bed for the [[Rutland Railway|Rutland & Burlington Railroad]] outside the town of [[Cavendish, Vermont|Cavendish]], Vermont.
Setting a blast involved boring a hole deep into a body of rock; add&shy;ing [[blasting powder]], a fuse, and sand; then compacting this charge into the hole using a [[wikt:tamp#English|''tamping iron'']]&mdash;a large iron rod.<ref name="OKFp25-27" group=upper-alpha>
See Mac&shy;millan (2000), pp.&nbsp;25&ndash;27 for the steps in setting a blast and the location and circum&shy;stances of the accident.
The blast hole, about {{convert|1+1/2|in}} in diameter and up to six feet (1.8&nbsp;m) deep, might require two men working half a day or more to "drill" using hand tools.
The labor invested in setting each blast, and the judgment involved in selecting its location and the amount of powder to be used&mdash;plus the often explosive nature of employer-employee relations on this type of job&mdash;underscore the significance of
Harlow's state&shy;ment that Gage's employers had considered him "the most effi&shy;cient and capable fore&shy;man in their employ" prior to the accident.<!--need additional Macmillan 2000 cite for labor relations-->
</ref>
Gage was doing this around 4:30 PM when (possibly because the sand was omit&shy;ted) the iron struck a spark against the rock and
{{quote|the powder exploded, carrying an iron instrument through his head an inch and a fourth in [diameter], and three feet and [seven] inches in length, which he was using at the time.

<p>A tone of be&shy;mused won&shy;der&shy;ment was com&shy;mon in 19th-cent&shy;ury med&shy;i&shy;cal writ&shy;ing about Gage (as well as about victims of other unlikely-sounding brain-injury accidents&mdash;see Mac&shy;millan 2000, {{nowrap|pp.&nbsp;66&ndash;7).}}  Noting dryly that, "The leading feature of this case is its im&shy;prob&shy;a&shy;bil&shy;ity&nbsp;... This is the sort of accident that happens in the pant&shy;o&shy;mime at the theater, not else&shy;where," Bigelow (1850, pp.&nbsp;13,19) emphasized that though "at first wholly skeptical, I have been per&shy;son&shy;al&shy;ly con&shy;vinced," calling the case "un&shy;par&shy;al&shy;led in the annals of surgery". This en&shy;dorse&shy;ment by Bigelow, Pro&shy;fes&shy;sor of Surgery at Harvard, helped end scoffing about Gage among physicians in general&mdash;one of whom, Harlow (1868, p.&nbsp;344) later recalled, had dis&shy;mis&shy;sed the matter as a "Yankee invention":
<!--I have the pleasure of being able to present to you, to-day, the history and sequel of a case of severe injury of the head, followed by recovery, which, so far as I know, remains without parallel in the annals of surgery.-->
"The case occurred nearly twenty years ago, in an ob&shy;scure country town&nbsp;..., was attended and reported by an ob&shy;scure country phys&shy;ic&shy;i&shy;an, and was rec&shy;eived by the Met&shy;ro&shy;pol&shy;i&shy;tan doctors with several grains of caution, in&shy;so&shy;much that many ut&shy;ter&shy;ly re&shy;fus&shy;ed to believe that the man had risen, until they had thrust their fingers into the hole of<!--sic--> his head," (see [[Doubting Thomas]]) "and even then they required of the Country Doctor at&shy;test&shy;ed statements, from clergymen and lawyers, before they could or would believe&mdash;many eminent surgeons regarding such an occurrence as a phys&shy;i&shy;o&shy;log&shy;i&shy;cal impossibility, the ap&shy;pear&shy;anc&shy;es pre&shy;sent&shy;ed by the subject being variously explained away."<!--  need page # -->
<p>
Indeed Jackson (1870, p. v) wrote that, "Unfortunately, and not&shy;with&shy;stand&shy;ing the evi&shy;dence that Dr.&nbsp;H. has furnished, the case seems, generally, to those who have not seen the skull, too much for human belief."
But after Gage was joined by such later cases as a miner who sur&shy;vived traversal of his head by a gas pipe, and a lumbermill foreman who returned to work soon after a "picket saw" cut into his forehead to a depth of
several inches,<!-- need correct measurements (not "nine inches deep" from case report -->
the ''Bos&shy;ton Med&shy;i&shy;cal&nbsp;& Surg&shy;i&shy;cal Jour&shy;nal'' (1870){{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} pre&shy;tend&shy;ed to won&shy;der whether the brain has any function at all: "Since the antics of iron bars, gas pipes, and the like skepticism is dis&shy;com&shy;fit&shy;ted, and dares not utter itself. Brains do not seem to be of much account these days."  The ''Transactions of the Vermont Medical Society'' (Smith, 1886, pp. 53&ndash;54) was similarly fa&shy;ce&shy;tious:
{{"'}}The times have been,'<!-- /The times have been/ is given in the source, though play actually reads, /The time has been/-->

</ref>
landed some 80&nbsp;feet (25&nbsp;m) away, "smeared with blood and brain."<ref name="harlow_p331"/><!-- check quote "blood and brains" -->

To the astonishment of his men{{cn|date=April 2013}} Gage spoke within a few minutes, walked with little assistance, and sat upright in an oxcart for the {{frac||3|4}}-mile (1.2&nbsp;km) ride to his lodgings in town. The first physician to see him was Dr. [[Edward H. Williams]]:
{{quote|I first noticed the wound upon the head before I alighted from my carriage, the pulsations of the brain being very distinct. Mr. Gage, during the time I was examining this wound, was relating the manner in which he was injured to the bystanders. I did not believe Mr. Gage's statement at that time, but thought he was deceived.  Mr. Gage persisted in saying that the bar went through his head&nbsp;.... Mr. G. got up and vomited; the effort of vomit&shy;ing pressed out about half a teacupful of the brain, which fell upon the floor.<ref>Excerpted from Williams' statement, in Bigelow (1850), pp.&nbsp;15&ndash;16.
</ref>}}

Dr. [[John Martyn Harlow]] took charge of the case about an hour later:
{{quote|You will excuse me for remarking here, that the picture presented was, to one unaccustomed to military surgery, truly ter&shy;rif&shy;ic; but the patient bore his sufferings with the most heroic firmness. He recognized me at once, and said he hoped he was not much hurt. He seemed to be perfectly conscious, but was getting exhausted from the hemorrhage.  Pulse 60, and regular.  His per&shy;son, and the bed on which he was laid, were literally one gore of blood.<ref>Excerpted from Harlow (1848), p.&nbsp;390.
</ref>}}

Despite Harlow's skillful care,<ref name="skillful" group="upper-alpha"/> Gage's recuperation was long and difficult.
Pressure on the brain<ref group="upper-alpha">
Harlow's notes (1868, p.&nbsp;335) for September 24: "Failing strength&nbsp;... During the three succeeding days the coma deepened; the [[Globe (human eye)|globe]] of the left eye became more protuberant, with fungus pushing out rapidly from the internal [[canthus]]&nbsp;... also large fungi pushing up rapidly from the wounded brain, and coming out at the top of the head".
Here ''fungus'' does not mean an infect&shy;ing [[mycosis]] but rather
(Oxford English Dictionary) a "spongy morb&shy;id growth or excrescence, such as exu&shy;ber&shy;ant gran&shy;u&shy;lat&shy;ion in a wound" i.e. part of the body's own reaction to the injury (Mac&shy;millan 2000, pp.&nbsp;54, 61&ndash;2).

left him semi-comatose from September 23 to October 3, "seldom speaking unless spoken to, and then answering only in mono&shy;syllables. The friends and attendants are in hourly expectancy of his death, and have his coffin and clothes in readiness."<ref>Excerpted from Harlow (1848) and Harlow (1868).
</ref> <!-- need page numbers; add surgery -->

But on October 7 Gage "succeeded in raising himself up, and took one step to his chair." One month later he was walking "up and down stairs, and about the house, into the [[wikt:piazza#English|piazza]]," and while Harlow was absent for a week, Gage was "in the street every day except Sunday," his desire to return to his family in New Hampshire being "uncontrollable by his friends&nbsp;... got wet feet and a chill." He soon developed a fever, but by mid-November he was "feeling better in every respect&nbsp;... walking about the house again; says he feels no pain in the head." Harlow's prognosis at this point: Gage "appears to be in a way of recov&shy;er&shy;ing, if he can be controlled."<ref>

<!---===============================================================================--->

==Subsequent life and travels==
By November 25 Gage was strong enough to return to his parents' home in [[Lebanon, New Hampshire]],<!-- actually, check who was in Lebanon vs Enfield at this point; close carriage is at OKF p.&nbsp;29 --> where by late Dec&shy;em&shy;ber he was "riding out, improving both mentally and physically." In April 1849 he returned to Cavendish and paid a visit to Har&shy;low, who noted at that time loss of vision (and [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]]) of the left eye, a large scar on the forehead, and "upon the top of the head&nbsp;... a deep depression, two inches by one and one-half inches wide, beneath which the pulsations of the brain can be per&shy;ceived. Partial paralysis of the left side of the face." Despite all this, "his physical health is good, and I am inclined to say he has recovered. Has no pain in head, but says it has a queer feeling which he is not able to describe."<ref>
Harlow (1849)<!--need page-->; Harlow (1868), p.&nbsp;338&ndash;9.
</ref>

Unable to return to his railroad work, Harlow says, Gage appeared for a time at
[[Barnum's American Museum]]<ref group="upper-alpha">
Contrary to common reports,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} [[Barnum's American Museum]] was not a travel&shy;ing show but a stat&shy;ion&shy;ary instal&shy;lat&shy;ion in New York City.
There is no evi&shy;dence Gage ex&shy;hib&shy;it&shy;ed with a troupe or circ&shy;us, or on a fair&shy;ground (Mac&shy;millan & Lena 2010, pp.&nbsp;3&ndash;4).

in New York City (the cu&shy;ri&shy;ous paying to see, presumably, both Gage and the instrument which had injured him) although there is no indep&shy;end&shy;¬≠ent con&shy;fir&shy;ma&shy;tion of this.
Recently, however, evidence has surfaced supporting Harlow's state&shy;ment that Gage made public appear&shy;ances in "the larger New England towns".<ref name="harlow1868p339-342"/><!-- provide direct cites here for "evidence has surfaced"? -->
(On Gage's job-loss and public ap&shy;pear&shy;ances, see more below.)
He later worked in a livery stable <!-- add coach service when cite is available -->
in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]].

In August of 1852 Gage was invited to Chile to work as a long-distance [[wikt:stagecoach|stagecoach]] driver there, "caring for horses, and often driving a coach heavily laden and drawn by six horses" on the [[Valparaiso]]&ndash;[[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] route.<!-- make sure cite and Harlow's narrative covers "long-distance" and other details; long-dist has been used too often here? -->
After his health began to fail around 1859, he left Chile for San Francisco, where he recovered under the care of his mother and sister (who had gone there from New Hampshire around the time Gage went to Chile).
For the next few months he did farm work in [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara]].<ref

In February 1860 Gage had the first in a series of increasingly severe convulsions, and he died in or near<ref name="GagepageQs"/> San Francisco on May 21&mdash;just under twelve years after his injury.
He was buried in San Francisco's [[Lone Mountain (California)|Lone Mountain Cemetery]].<ref name="birthandname" group="upper-alpha"/><!--actually, is this cite specific to burial, or only death date etc? -->

About a year after the accident, Gage had allowed his tamping iron to be placed in Harvard Medical School's [[Warren Anatomical Museum]], but he later reclaimed it, and made what he called "my iron bar" his "constant companion during the remainder of his life";<ref name="harlow1868p339-342"/> now it accompanied the skull on its journey to Harlow. After studying them for a triumphal retrospective paper on Gage (1868) Harlow redeposited the iron&mdash;this time with Gage's skull&mdash;in the Warren Museum, where they remain on display today.<ref group=upper-alpha>
Jackson (1870), p. v: "The most valuable specimen that has ever been added to the Museum, and probably every will be, was given two years ago by Dr. John M. Harlow, of Woburn&nbsp;...<!--.

Significant [[traumatic brain injury|brain injury]] is often fatal, but Harlow called Gage "the man for the case.  His physique, will, and capacity of endurance could scarcely be excelled,"<!-- need cite on this --><ref name="skillful"
group="upper-alpha">
Harlow wrote that Gage had been "a perfectly healthy, strong and active young man&nbsp;... nervo-bilious temperament, five feet six inches in height, average weight one hundred and fifty pounds, possessing an iron will as well as an iron frame; muscular system unusually well developed&mdash;having had scarcely a day's illness from his childhood to the date of this injury."
(''Nervo-bilious'' describes an rare combination of "excitable and active mental powers" with "energy and strength [of] mind and body [making] possible the endurance of great mental and physical labor."){{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
He also emphasized the importance of the opening, created by the tamping iron, connecting Gage's cranium to his mouth, as
"without this opening in the base of the skull, for drainage, recovery would have been impossible."
As to his own role in Gage's survival, he merely averred, "I can only say, along with good old [[Ambroise Par√©|Ambro[i]se Par√©]], I dressed him, God healed him"<!-- chk quote -->

===First-hand reports of mental changes===
Without question Gage displayed some kind of change in behavior after his accident,<ref name="MacmillanLena2010passim">
Mac&shy;millan & Lena (2010) ''passim''.<!-- certain pp within this can be called as as "esp.", and likely other papers + Macmillan 2000 cited too -->
</ref>
but the nature, extent, and duration of this change are very uncertain.
In fact little is known about what Gage was like either before or after his injury
(almost none of it first-hand),<ref name="accounts_reliablesources" group="upper-alpha"/>
the mental changes described after his death were much more dramatic than anything reported while he was alive,
and the very few descriptions which seem credible do not specify the period of his post-accident life to which they are meant to apply.

In his 1848 report, as Gage was just completing his physical recovery, Harlow had only hinted at possible psychological symptoms:
"The mental manifestations of the patient, I leave to a future com&shy;mun&shy;i&shy;cat&shy;ion.
I think the case&nbsp;... is exceedingly interesting to the enlightened physiologist and intellectual philosopher."<ref>
Harlow (1848), p.&nbsp;393.
</ref>
And after observing Gage for several weeks in late 1849, [[Henry Jacob Bigelow]], Professor of Surgery at Harvard, went so far as to say that Gage was "quite recovered in faculties of body and mind," there being "inconsiderable disturbance of function".<ref name="bigelow1850pp" group="upper-alpha"/>

It was twenty years later that Harlow, having obtained Gage's skull and the history of his last years, described the mental changes found today in most presentations of the case (though usually in ex&shy;ag&shy;ger&shy;at&shy;ed or dis&shy;tort&shy;ed form&mdash;[[#Distortion of mental changes|see below]]).
In memorable language he described the pre-accident Gage as hard-working, responsible,
and "a great favorite" with the men in his charge,
his employers having regarded him as "the most efficient and capable foreman in their employ".
But these same employers, after Gage's accident, "considered the change in his mind so marked that they could not give him his place again":
{{quote|The equilibrium or balance, so to speak, between his intellectual faculties and animal propensities, seems to have been destroyed.  He is fitful, irreverent, indulging at times in the grossest profanity (which was not pre&shy;vi&shy;ous&shy;ly his custom), manifesting but little deference for his fellows, impatient of restraint or advice when it conflicts with his desires, at times pertinaciously obstinate, yet capricious and vacillating, devising many plans of future operations, which are no sooner arranged than they are abandoned in turn for others appearing more feasible. A child in his intellectual capacity and manifestations, he has the animal passions of a strong man. Previous to his injury, although untrained in the schools, he possessed a well-balanced mind, and was looked upon by those who knew him as a shrewd, smart businessman, very energetic and persistent in executing all his plans of operation. In this regard his mind was radically changed, so decidedly that his friends and acquaintances said he was "no longer Gage".}}
This oft-quoted description appears to draw on Harlow's own notes set down soon after the accident,<ref>
Macmillan (2000), pp.&nbsp;90, 375.
</ref>
but other behaviors he describes<ref>
Macmillan (2000), pp.&nbsp;117&ndash;8 (Table 6.1); Harlow (1868), pp.&nbsp;339&ndash;41,345.
</ref>
appear to draw on later com&shy;mun&shy;i&shy;cat&shy;ions from Gage's friends or family,<ref name="recollections" group="upper-alpha">
A further consideration is potential reluctance on the part of Gage's friends and family, and of Harlow himself, to describe Gage negatively, especially while he was still alive (Mac&shy;millan 2000, pp.&nbsp;106&ndash;8, 375&ndash;6).
At Mac&shy;millan (2000), pp.&nbsp;350&ndash;1 it is argued that an 1850 com&shy;mun&shy;i&shy;cat&shy;ion caling Gage "gross, profane, coarse, and vulgar" was anonymously supplied by Harlow.<!--consider adding to source list -->

and it is difficult to match these various behaviors (which range widely in their implied level of functional im&shy;pair&shy;ment)<ref group="upper-alpha">
For example, the "fitful, irreverent&nbsp;... capricious and vacillating" Gage described in Harlow (1868) is somewhat at variance with Gage's stagecoach work in Chile, which required drivers "to be reliable, resourceful, and possess great endurance.

===Theoretical use and misuse===<!-- linked from [[History_of_neurology]] -->
Beyond the importance of correcting the record of a much-cited case, Mac&shy;millan writes, "Phineas' story is worth remembering be&shy;cause it illustrates how easily a small stock of facts becomes transformed into popular and scientific myth,"
the paucity of evi&shy;dence having allowed "the fitting of almost any theory to the small number of facts we have".<ref name="fitting">
Macmillan (2000), p.&nbsp;290; Macmillan (2008), p.&nbsp;831.
</ref>
A similar concern was expressed as far back as 1877, when British neurologist [[David Ferrier]], writing to America in an attempt "to have this case definitely settled," complained that "In investigating reports on diseases and injuries of the brain, I am constantly amazed at the inexactitude and distortion to which they are subject by men who have some pet theory to support. The facts suffer so frightfully."<!-- check "on" "of"; shouldn't this quotation end with an ellipsis? --><ref group=upper-alpha>
Ferrier (1870&ndash;9). Smith (1886, p. 51) noted "the ingenuity with which ad&shy;vo&shy;cates of various theories [about the brain] will explain away the evidence of their opponents."</ref>

Thus in the nineteenth-century controversy over whether or not the various mental functions are [[cerebral localization|localized in specific regions of the brain]], both sides found ways to cite Gage in support of their theories;<ref>
Barker (1995); Macmillan (2000), ch.&nbsp;9, esp. p.&nbsp;188.
</ref>
for example, while Ferrier (1878) cited Gage as evidence that the brain is localized, Dupuy (1877) used him as proof that it is not.
<!--add frontal function / no function -->
[[phrenology|Phrenologists]] made use of Gage as well, claiming that his mental changes resulted from destruction of his "organ of Veneration" and/or the adjacent "organ of Benevolence".<ref name=sizer1888>

careful inquiry turns up no such link according to Mac&shy;millan:
{{quote|[T]here is no evidence that Gage's case contributed directly to psychosurgery&nbsp;.... As with surgery for the brain generally, what his case did show came solely from his surviving his accident: major operations could be performed on the brain without the outcome necessarily being fatal.<ref>

{{anchor|BehaviorDiffered}}
In 2008 an advertisement for a pre&shy;vi&shy;ous&shy;ly unknown public appearance by Gage was discovered, as well as a report of his physical and mental condition during his time in Chile, a description of what may well have been his daily work routine there as a stagecoach driver, and more recently an ad for a second public appearance.<!-- cite Unanswered Qs a/o Meet Gage / More about Gage -->
This new evidence implies that the seriously maladapted Gage described by Harlow existed for only a limited time after the accident&mdash;that Gage eventually "figured out how to live" despite his injury,<ref>Fleischman (2002)<!--get specific page number-->
</ref>
and was in later life far more functional, and socially far better adapted, than pre&shy;vi&shy;ous&shy;ly thought.<ref name="Macmillan 2008 p.&nbsp;831">Macmillan (2008), p.&nbsp;831
</ref>

Macmillan hypothesizes that this change represents a ''social recovery'' undergone by Gage over time, citing per&shy;sons with similar injuries for whom "someone or something gave enough struc&shy;ture to their lives for them to relearn lost social and per&shy;son&shy;al skills" (in Gage's case, his highly struc&shy;tured employment in Chile).<ref
group=upper-alpha>
Macmillan & Aggleton (2011): "Phineas' sur&shy;viv&shy;al and rehab&shy;ilitation demonstrated a theory of recovery which has influenced the treatment of front&shy;al lobe damage today. [Mac&shy;millan explains,] 'There are something like 15 or 20 cases of people who've re&shy;cov&shy;ered from very serious front&shy;al brain injury, of the kind that Phineas suffered from, without any pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al assistance. In every case, what's common in the reports is that someone, or some&shy;thing, has taken over the lives of these people and given them struc&shy;ture.' In modern treatment, add&shy;ing struc&shy;ture to tasks by, for example, mentally visualising a written list, is considered a key method in coping with front&shy;al lobe damage. 'Phineas worked as a stage-coach driver,' continues Professor Mac&shy;millan. 'The job is one that has got an external struc&shy;ture. You've got to be here for this part, then there's that part, then there's something else. Just as with these cases who have recovered.{{'"}}
</ref>
If this is so, he points out, then along with theoretical implications it "would add to current evidence that rehabilitation can be effective even in difficult and long-standing cases"<ref name="Macmillan 2008 p.&nbsp;831"/>&mdash;and if Gage could achieve such improvement without medical supervision, "what are the limits for those in formal rehabilitation programs?"<ref name=macmillan_more/>
<!---===============================================================================--->
==Portraits==
In 2009 a [[daguerreotype]] portrait of Gage was identified&mdash;the first likeness of him identified other than a life mask taken around 1850.
It shows "a disfigured yet still-handsome" Gage<ref name="Twomey">
Twomey (2010)
</ref>
with one eye closed and scars clearly visible, "well dressed and confident, even proud"<ref name=wilgus2009/>
and holding his iron, on which portions of the inscription ([[#inscription|recited above]]) can be made out.
{{anchor|not_harpoon}}(For decades the da&shy;guerre&shy;o&shy;type's owners had imagined that it showed an injured [[wikt:whaler|whaler]] with his [[harpoon]].)<ref name=wilgus_meet>

|title=Meet Phineas Gage|last=Wilgus|first=B.&nbsp;&&nbsp;J|accessdate=Oct 2, 2009}}
</ref>
Authenticity was confirmed in several ways, including photo-overlaying the inscription visible in the portrait against that on the actual tamping iron in Harvard's Warren Anatomical Museum, and matching the injuries seen in the portrait against those preserved in the life mask.<ref name=wilgus2009>
Wilgus (2009)

Macmillan cites the daguerre&shy;o&shy;type as consistent with the social recovery hypothesis already described.<ref name=macmillan_more>

To better understand the question, he and collaborators are actively seeking additional evidence on Gage's life and behavior,
and describe certain kinds of historical material (see "Phineas Gage: Unanswered questions" in ''External links'', below)<ref group=upper-alpha>[http://www.deakin.edu.au/hmnbs/psychology/gagepage/PgQuestn.php Phineas Gage: Unanswered Questions]<!-- cite needs completion and integration with external links etc-->

such as letters or diaries by physicians whom their re&shy;search indicates Gage may have met, or by per&shy;sons in certain places Gage seems to have been.<ref name="GagepageQs">{{cite web

In 2010 a second portrait of Gage was identified.
This new image, copies of which are in the possession of at least two different branches of the Gage family, depicts the same subject seen in the Wilgus da&shy;guerre&shy;o&shy;type identified in 2009, according to Gage re&shy;search&shy;ers consulted by the Smithsonian Institution.<ref name="millerhartleyimage" group="upper-alpha">
Lena & Mac&shy;millan (2010), citing also B.&nbsp;&&nbsp;J. Wilgus. The image seen here is in the pos&shy;ses&shy;sion of Tara Gage Miller of Texas; an identical image belongs to Phyllis Gage Hartley of New Jersey.
(Gage had no known children&mdash;see Mac&shy;millan 2000, pp.&nbsp;319,327; these are de&shy;scend&shy;ents of cer&shy;tain of his rel&shy;a&shy;tives&mdash;see Mac&shy;millan & Lena 2010, p.&nbsp;4.)
Unlike the Wilgus por&shy;trait, which is an actual da&shy;guerre&shy;o&shy;type, the Miller and Hartley images are 19th-century pho&shy;to&shy;graph&shy;ic repro&shy;duct&shy;ions of a com&shy;mon orig&shy;inal which remains undiscovered, itself a da&shy;guerre&shy;o&shy;type or other laterally (left-right) reversing early-process photograph; a second, com&shy;pen&shy;sating reversal has been applied here to show Gage as he appeared in life.
Gage's shirt and tie are different in the Miller-Hartley image than in the Wilgus image, though he is wearing the same [[waistcoat]] and possibly the same jacket; see {{cite web
