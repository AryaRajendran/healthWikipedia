The '''metatarsus''' or '''metatarsal bones''' are a group of five [[long bone]]s in the [[foot]] located between the [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsal bones]] of the hind- and mid-foot and the [[Phalanges of the foot|phalanges]] of the toes.  Lacking individual names, the metatarsal bones are numbered from the [[Anatomical terms of location|medial]] side (side of [[great toe]]): the [[First metatarsal bone|first]], [[Second metatarsal bone|second]], [[Third metatarsal bone|third]], [[Fourth metatarsal bone|fourth]], and [[Fifth metatarsal bone|fifth metatarsal]] (often depicted with [[Roman numerals]]).  The metatarsals are analogous to the [[metacarpus|metacarpal]] bones of the [[hand]]. The length of the metatarsal bones in humans are in falling order; second, third, fourth, fifth and first.<ref name=Bojsen246>{{cite book |last=Bojsen-Møller |first=Finn  |last2=Simonsen |first2=Erik B. |last3=Tranum-Jensen |first3=Jørgen| year=2001 |title=Bevægeapparatets anatomi |edition=12th |language=Danish |trans_title=Anatomy of the Locomotive Apparatus | isbn =978-87-628-0307-7|pages=246 |accessdate=Marts 1, 2012}}</ref>   

==  Common characteristics ==
The five metatarsals are dorsally convex [[long bones]] consisting of a shaft or body, a base, and a head.
<ref name="Platzer-220">Platzer 2004, p 220</ref> The body is prismoid in form, tapers gradually from the [[tarsus (skeleton)|tarsal]] to the [[Phalanx bones|phalangeal]] extremity, and is curved longitudinally, so as to be concave below, slightly convex above.  The base or [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] extremity is [[Wedge (geometry)|wedge]]-shaped, articulating proximally with the tarsal bones, and by its sides with the contiguous metatarsal bones: its [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] and plantar surfaces are rough for the attachment of [[ligament]]s.  The head or anterior extremity presents a convex articular surface, oblong from above downward, and extending farther backward below than above.  Its sides are flattened, and on each is a depression, surmounted by a [[Tubercle (anatomy)|tubercle]], for ligamentous attachment.  Its [[plantar]] surface is grooved antero-posteriorly for the passage of the flexor [[tendon]]s, and marked on either side by an articular eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.

==  Articulations ==
[[File:Ospied-de.svg|thumb|Bones of the right foot. Dorsal surface. Metatarsus shown in yellow]]
The base of each metatarsal bone articulates with one or more of the tarsal bones at the [[tarsometatarsal joint]]s, and the head with one of the first row of phalanges at the [[metatarsophalangeal joint]]s.  Their bases also articulate with each other at the [[intermetatarsal articulations|intermetatarsal joints]]

* The [[First metatarsal bone|''first'' metatarsal]] articulates with the [[Medial cuneiform bone|medial cuneiform]], and to a small extent to the [[Intermediate cuneiform bone|intermediate cuneiform]].<ref name="Platzer-218">Platzer 2004, p 218</ref>

* the [[Fourth metatarsal bone|''fourth'']] with the lateral cuneiform and the [[Cuboid bone|cuboid]].<ref name="Platzer-218" />

==Injuries==
The metatarsal bones are often broken by [[association football]] players. These and other recent cases have been attributed to the modern lightweight design of [[football boot]]s, which give less protection to the foot. In 2010 some soccer players began trialling a new sock that incorporated a rubber silicon pad over the foot to provide protection to the top of the foot.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bill|first=Mills|title=Sock boffs may have cured metatarsal woes for Rooney and Co.|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Sock-boffs-may-have-cured-metatarsal-woes-for-Wayne-Rooney-and-Co-article649675.html|accessdate=12 December 2010|date=11 December 2010|publisher=www.mirrorfootball.co.uk}}</ref>

The metatarsal bone injury gained notoriety with soccer fans when the then [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo La Coruña]] midfielder [[Aldo Duscher]] made a strong tackle on [[David Beckham]] breaking his second metatarsal bone and his participation in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] became doubtful. Beckham eventually made it to the [[2002 FIFA World Cup squads#England|England 2002 World Cup squad]]. Since then, [[Wayne Rooney]], [[Steven Gerrard]], [[Roy Keane]], [[Xabi Alonso]] and [[Michael Owen]] have gone down the same road alongside many others.<ref>[http://soccerlens.com/metatarsal/16159/ The Metatarsal], [http://soccerlens.com/ Soccerlens], 2008-07-28. Retrieved: 2010-07-02.</ref>

Stress fractures are thought to account for 16% of injuries related to sports preparation, and the metatarsals are most often involved.  These fractures are commonly called [[march fracture]]s, as they were commonly diagnosed among military recruits after long marches.  The second and third metatarsals are fixed while walking, thus these metatarsals are common sites of injury.  The fifth metatarsal may be fractured if the foot is [[supination|oversupinated]] during locomotion.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.emedicine.com/sports/topic81.htm | title = Metatarsal Stress Fracture | last = Perron | first = Andrew D. | date = 2005-11-23 | accessdate = 2007-09-13}}</ref>

==Protection==
[[Steel-toe boot|Safety footwear]] is available with built-in metatarsal guards, however removable metatarsal guards are also available.
