'''Bone density''' (or '''[[bone mineral]] density''') is a [[medical term]] normally referring to the amount of mineral matter per square centimeter of [[bone]]s.<ref>{{MeshName|Bone+Density}}</ref> Bone density (or '''BMD''') is used in clinical medicine as an indirect indicator of [[osteoporosis]] and [[fracture]] risk.

This medical bone density is not the true [[physics|physical]] "density" of the bone, which would be computed as mass per volume. It is measured by a procedure called ''[[densitometry]]'', often performed in the [[radiology]] or [[nuclear medicine]] departments of [[hospital]]s or [[clinic]]s. The measurement is painless and non-invasive and involves low [[radiation]] exposure. Measurements are most commonly made over the [[lumbar spine]] and over the upper part of the [[hip]].<ref name="pmid18587077">{{cite journal |author=Cole RE |title=Improving clinical decisions for women at risk of osteoporosis: dual-femur bone mineral density testing |journal=J Am Osteopath Assoc |volume=108 |issue=6 |pages=289–95 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18587077 |doi= |url=http://www.jaoa.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18587077}}</ref> The forearm may be scanned if the hip and lumbar spine are not accessible. Average  density is around 1500&nbsp;kg m<sup>−3</sup>

There is a [[statistics|statistical]] association between poor bone density and higher probability of fracture. Fractures of the legs and [[pelvis]] due to falls are a significant [[public health]] problem, especially in elderly women, leading to much medical cost, inability to live independently, and even risk of death. Bone density measurements are used to screen women for osteoporosis risk and to identify those who might benefit from measures to improve bone strength.

==Testing==
Bone density tests are not necessary for people without risk factors for weak bones.<ref>{{Citation |author1 = American Academy of Family Physicians |author1-link = American Academy of Family Physicians |others = presented by [[ABIM Foundation]] |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Acad_Fam_Phys.pdf |accessdate = August 14, 2012}}</ref><ref name="whenyouneed">{{Citation | author1 = [[Consumer Reports]]| author2 = [[American Academy of Family Physicians]]| date = May 2012| title = Bone-density tests: When you need them — and when you don't| publisher = [[Consumer Reports]]| work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]]| page = | url = http://consumerhealthchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ChoosingWiselyBoneDensityAAFP.pdf| accessdate = August 14, 2012}}</ref> Unnecessary testing is more likely to result in superfluous treatment rather than discovery of a true problem.<ref name="whenyouneed"/>

===Indications for testing===
The following are risk factors for low bone density and primary considerations for the need for a bone density test.

*females age 65<ref name="whenyouneed"/>
*males age 70<ref name="whenyouneed"/>
*people over age 50 with any of the following:
**previous bone fracture from trauma<ref name="whenyouneed"/>
**rheumatoid arthritis<ref name="whenyouneed"/>
**low body weight<ref name="whenyouneed"/>
**a parent with a hip fracture<ref name="whenyouneed"/>
*Individuals with [[vertebrae|vertebral]] abnormalities.<ref name="titleNOF - Bone Mass Measurement">{{cite web |url=http://www.nof.org/osteoporosis/bonemass.htm |title=NOF - Bone Mass Measurement |accessdate=2008-03-20 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080307014020/http://www.nof.org/osteoporosis/bonemass.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-03-07}}</ref>
*Individuals receiving, or planning to receive, long-term glucocorticoid ([[steroid]]) therapy.<ref name="titleNOF - Bone Mass Measurement"/>
*Individuals with primary [[hyperparathyroidism]].<ref name="titleNOF - Bone Mass Measurement"/>
*Individuals being monitored to assess the response or efficacy of an approved osteoporosis drug therapy.<ref name="titleNOF - Bone Mass Measurement"/>
*Individuals with a history of eating disorders<ref name="titleNOF - Bone Mass Measurement"/>

Other considerations which related to risk of low bone density and the need for a test include smoking habits, drinking habits, the long-term use of corticosteroid drugs, and a vitamin D deficiency.<ref name="whenyouneed"/>

===Overtesting and treatment===
For those people who do have bone density tests, two conditions which may be detected are [[osteoporosis]] and [[osteopenia]].<ref name="whenyouneed"/> The usual response to either of these indications is consultation with a physician.<ref name="whenyouneed"/>

==Terms==
Results are often reported in 3 terms:
#Measured areal density in g cm<sup>−3</sup>
#[[z-score]], the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for the patient's age, sex and ethnicity
#[[t-score]], the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for a healthy 30 year old adult of the same sex and ethnicity as the patient

==Limitations==
Use of BMD has several limitations.
#Measurement can be affected by the size of the patient, the thickness of tissue overlying the bone, and other factors extraneous to the bones.
#Bone density is a proxy measurement for bone strength, which is the resistance to fracture and the truly significant characteristic. Although the two are usually related, there are some circumstances in which bone density is a poorer indicator of bone strength.
#Reference standards for some populations (e.g., children) are unavailable for many of the methods used.
#Crushed vertebrae can result in falsely high bone density so must be excluded from analysis.

==Types of tests==
While there are many different types of BMD tests, all are non-invasive.  Most tests differ in which bones are measured to determine the BMD result.

These tests include:
*[[DEXA|Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DXA or DEXA)
*[[QCT|Quantitative computed tomography]] (QCT)
*[[QUS|Qualitative ultrasound]] (QUS)
*[[Single photon absorptiometry]]  (SPA)
*[[Dual photon absorptiometry]]  (DPA)
*[[Digital X-ray radiogrammetry]] (DXR)
*[[SEXA|Single energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (SEXA)

DEXA is currently the most widely used, but [[ultrasound]] has been described as a more cost-effective approach to measure bone density.<ref name="urlBone densitometry">{{cite web |url=http://courses.washington.edu/bonephys/opbmd.html |title=Bone densitometry |work= |accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref>

The test works by measuring a specific [[bone]] or bones, usually the spine, hip, and wrist.  The density of these bones is then compared with an average index based on age, sex, and size.  The resulting comparison is used to determine risk for fractures and the stage of osteoporosis in an individual.

Average bone mineral density = BMC / W [g/cm<sup>2</sup>]
*BMC = bone mineral content = g/cm
*W = width at the scanned line

==Interpretation==
Results are generally scored by two measures, the [[T-score]] and the [[Z-score]]. Scores indicate the amount one's bone mineral density varies from the mean. Negative scores indicate lower bone density, and positive scores indicate higher.

===T-score===
The T-score is the relevant measure when screening for osteoporosis. It is the bone mineral density at the site when compared to the '''young normal reference mean'''. It is a comparison of a patient's BMD to that of a healthy thirty-year-old of the same sex and ethnicity. This value is used in post-menopausal women and men over age 50 because it better predicts risk of future fracture.<ref name="Richmond">{{cite web|url=http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?ss=15&doc_id=11559&nbr=5990 |title=Osteoporosis and bone mineral density. |accessdate=2008-05-11 |last=Richmond |first=Bradford |date=2007-11-13 |publisher=American College of Radiology }}</ref> The criteria of the [[World Health Organization]] are:<ref name="WHOcriteria">{{cite web | author=WHO Scientific Group on the Prevention and Management of Osteoporosis (2000 : Geneva, Switzerland) |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_921.pdf |title=Prevention and management of osteoporosis : report of a WHO scientific group| year=2003 |accessdate=2007-05-31 |format=pdf |work=}}</ref>
* Normal is a T-score of -1.0 or higher
* [[Osteopenia]] is defined as between -1.0 and -2.5
* [[Osteoporosis]] is defined as -2.5 or lower, meaning a bone density that is two and a half standard deviations below the mean of a thirty-year-old man/woman.

|}

===Z-score===
The Z-score is the comparison to the '''age-matched normal''' and is usually used in cases of severe osteoporosis. This is the number of standard deviations a patient's BMD differs from the average BMD of their age, sex, and ethnicity. This value is used in premenopausal women, men under the age of 50, and in children.<ref name="Richmond" /> It is most useful when the score is less than 2 standard deviations below this normal. In this setting, it is helpful to scrutinize for coexisting illnesses that may contribute to osteoporosis such as glucocorticoid therapy, hyperparathyroidism, or alcoholism.

==Diet==
There may be associations between some forms of BMD and diet.<ref>Diet can influence BMD in postmenopausal women http://www.searchmedica.com/resource.html?rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.modernmedicine.com%2Fmodernmedicine%2FModern%2BMedicine%2BNow%2FDiet-can-influence-BMD-in-postmenopausal-women%2FArticleNewsFeed%2FArticle%2Fdetail%2F745343&q=herb&cq=herb&c=ps&ss=defLink&p=Convera&fr=true&ds=20&srid=4</ref>
