'''Delayed ejaculation,''' also called ''retarded ejaculation'' or ''inhibited ejaculation,'' is the inability to ejaculate or persistent difficulty in achieving [[orgasm]] despite the presence of normal [[sexual desire]] and [[sexual stimulation]]. Normally a man can achieve orgasm within a few minutes of active thrusting during sexual [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]], whereas a man with delayed ejaculation either does not have orgasms at all or cannot have an orgasm until after prolonged intercourse which might last for 30–45 minutes or more.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Knowles |first=David R. |encyclopedia=A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia |title=Delayed ejaculation |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001954.htm |accessdate=2007-05-24 |date=2005-06-01 |publisher=A.D.A.M., Inc.}}</ref> In most cases delayed ejaculation presents the condition in which the man can climax and ejaculate only during [[masturbation]], but not during sexual intercourse.  It is an uncommon of the male sexual dysfunctions, but can result as a side effect of some medications. In one survey, 8% of men reported being unable to achieve orgasm over a 2-month period or longer in the the previous year.<ref name = Oxford2009>Strassberg, D. S., & Perelman, M. A. (2009).

==Causes==
===Psychological causes of delayed ejaculation===
Psychological causes of delayed ejaculation might include numerous factors that prevent a man from achieving orgasm during sexual intercourse.  Among those factors are insufficient sleep, distraction due to worry, distraction from the environment, anxiety about pleasing his partner and anxiety about relationship problems.<ref>{{cite journal

===Physical causes===
One proposed cause of delayed ejaculation is adaptation to a certain masturbatory technique.<ref>{{cite journal

Factors such as pressure, angle and grip during masturbation can make for an experience so different from sex with a partner that the ability to ejaculate is reduced or eliminated.

Difficulty in achieving orgasm can also result from [[pelvic]] [[surgery]] that involved [[Physical trauma|trauma]] to pelvic nerves which are responsible for orgasm. Some men report a lack of sensation in the nerves of the glans penis, which may or may not be related to external factors, including a history of circumcision.<ref> Dias J, Freitas R, Amorim R,Espiridião P, Xambre L, Ferraz L, Adult circumcision and male sexual health: a retrospective analysis, Andrologia, 20 April 2013 DOI: 10.1111/and.12101 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/and.12101/abstract]</ref>

Delayed ejaculation might be a [[adverse effect|side effect]] of some [[medications]], usually of some [[antidepressants]] (e.g. [[Paxil]]), antipsychotics ([[mellaril]]) and [[antihypertensives]] ([[guanethidine]]).<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/enc/delayed-ejaculation.html drugs.com > Delayed ejaculation] Review Date: 6/5/2007.

Another reason for delayed ejaculation is excessive use of [[alcohol]] (colloquially referred to as "whiskey dick" and "brewer's droop"). In this case physical and psychological causes might co-exist. Opiate-based medications and recreational drugs can prevent or delay ejaculation as they paralyze or slow all involuntary muscles, such as the ones that control dilation of the eyes, digestion, urination and ejaculation. Weight can also be a factor, as it slows blood flow to the penis.

More recently, the prevalence and easy access to pornography of any flavor a man prefers, has increasingly lead to a frequent level of external or visual stimulation that is hard to create with a partner. The psychological association with such visual stimulation can become habitual. Similar to how the specific physical stimulation of his own hand with frequent masturbation can lead to [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14961061 delayed insertive ejaculation]<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14961061</ref> (or in some cases, the inability to ejaculate), when the man is unable to duplicate (with [[insertional intercourse]]) the type of stimulation he gets from his own hand. In this case, he is unable to duplicate the stimulation he gets visually/mentally from frequent use of pornography. Although one cause is physical and the other cause is psychological, the result can be the same. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16422870 Psychological factors]<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16422870</ref> are widely known to have a tremendous sexual side effects, including delayed ejaculation, premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction.

==Treatment==
===Sex therapy===
Therapy usually involves homework assignments and exercises intended to help a man get used to having orgasms through [[insertional intercourse]], vaginal, anal, or oral, that is through the way he is not accustomed to. Commonly the couple is advised to go through three stages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/sex_relationships/facts/ejaculatoryincompetence.htm|title=Delayed ejaculation (retarded ejaculation)|publisher=NetDoctor.co.uk|date=2007-06-25|accessdate=2007-10-25|author=Dr. David Delvin}}</ref> At the first stage a man masturbates in the presence of his partner. Sometimes this is not an easy matter as a man might be used to having orgasms alone. After a man learns to ejaculate in the presence of his partner, the couple gets to another stage where the man's hand is replaced with the hand of his partner. Step by step a man learns to ejaculate closer and closer to the desired orifice. In the final stage the receptive partner inserts the [[insertive partner]]'s [[penis]] into the partner's vagina, anus or mouth as soon as the ejaculation is felt to be imminent. Thus a man gradually learns to ejaculate inside the desired orifice.<ref name=Oxford2009/>

===Other===
In some cases [[hypnosis]] can help with the problem, especially if a partner does not want to participate in [[Counseling|therapy]]. [[Meditation]] has also been seen to be effective in case studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/v673716h15l1672n/|title=Case reports on the use of meditative relaxation as an intervention strategy with retarded ejaculation |publisher=Springer Netherlands|date=June 1984|accessdate=2007-10-25|author=M.

There is yet no reliable medication for delayed ejaculation. [[PDE5 inhibitors]] such as Viagra have little effect.<ref>[http://www.thecarlatreport.com/index.asp?page=wp3152007193733 The Carlat Psychiatry Report > PDE-5 Inhibitors: Which to Choose?] Published in The Carlat Psychiatry Report.
