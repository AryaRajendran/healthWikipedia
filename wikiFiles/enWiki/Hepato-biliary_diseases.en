'''Hepato-biliary diseases''' affect the [[liver]] and/or [[biliary tract]], and are studied in the branch of medicine called [[Hepatology]].

==Liver diseases==
{{See|Chronic liver disease}}

==Viral hepatitis==
* Acute [[hepatitis A]]
* Acute [[hepatitis B]]
* Acute [[hepatitis C]]
* Acute [[Hepatitis D]] -this is actually a superinfection with the delta-agent in a patient already infected with hepatitis B
* Acute [[hepatitis E]]
* Chronic viral hepatitis
* Other viral hepatitis viruses may exist but their relation to the disease is not firmly established like the previous ones ([[Hepatitis F]], [[GB virus C]], [[Hepatitis X]])

==Liver dysfunction in other infectious diseases==
* [[Hepatitis]]:
** [[cytomegalovirus]] infection
** herpesviral: [[herpes simplex]] infection
* [[Toxoplasmosis]]
* Hepatosplenic [[schistosomiasis]]
* [[Portal hypertension]] in [[schistosomiasis]]
* Liver disease in [[syphilis]]
* [[Epstein-Barr virus]] infection
* [[yellow fever]] virus infection
* [[rubella]] virus infection
* [[leptospirosis]]
* [[Echinococcosis]]
* [[Amoebiasis]]

==Other inflammatory liver diseases==
* [[liver abscess]]
* [[autoimmune hepatitis]]
* [[primary biliary cirrhosis]]
* [[phlebitis]] of the [[portal vein]]
* granulomatous hepatitis
* [[Hepatitis#Autoimmune]]s in:
** [[berylliosis]]
** [[sarcoidosis]]

==Alcoholic liver disease==
This may cause [[fatty liver]], [[hepatitis]], [[fibrosis]] and [[Sclerosis (medicine)|sclerosis]] leading to [[cirrhosis]] and finally [[hepatic failure]].

==Toxic liver disease==
This includes mostly drug-induced [[hepatotoxicity]], which may generate many different patterns over liver disease, including 
* [[cholestasis]]
* [[necrosis]]
* acute hepatitis and chronic [[hepatitis]] of different forms,
* [[cirrhosis]]
* [http://www.medicinenet.com/tylenol_liver_damage/article.htm Effects of Acetaminophen (Tylenol)]
* other rare disorders like [[focal nodular hyperplasia]], [[Hepatic_fibrosis]], [[peliosis hepatis]] and [[veno-occlusive disease]].
Liver damage is part of hi[[Reye's syndrome]].

==Liver tumours==
Malignant [[liver tumour|neoplasm of liver]] and intrahepatic bile ducts. The most frequent forms are [[metastatic]] malignant neoplasm of liver)
* liver cell carcinoma
** [[hepatocellular carcinoma]]
** [[hepatoma]]
* [[cholangiocarcinoma]]
* [[hepatoblastoma]]
* [[angiosarcoma]] of liver
* [[Kupffer cell]] sarcoma
* other sarcomas of liver

Benign [[liver tumour|neoplasm of liver]] include [[hepatic]] [[hemangioma]]s, [[Adenoma#Liver|hepatic adenoma]]s, and [[focal nodular hyperplasia]] (FNH).

==End-stage liver disease==
Chronic liver diseases like [[chronic hepatitis]], chronic [[alcohol abuse]] or chronic [[hepatotoxicity|toxic liver disease]] may cause 
* [[hepatic failure]] and [[hepatorenal syndrome]]
* [[fibrosis]] and [[cirrhosis]] of [[liver]]
Cirrhosis may also occur in [[primary biliary cirrhosis]]. Rarely, cirrhosis is congenital.

==Metabolic diseases==
* '''metabolic diseases''' (chapter E in ICD-10)
** [[haemochromatosis]]
** [[Wilson's disease]]
** [[Gilbert's syndrome]]
** [[Crigler-Najjar syndrome]]
** [[Dubin-Johnson syndrome]]
** [[Rotor's syndrome]]

==Vascular disorders==
* chronic passive congestion of liver
* central haemorrhagic necrosis of liver
* [[infarction]] of liver
* [[peliosis hepatis]]
* [[veno-occlusive disease]]
* [[portal hypertension]]
* [[Budd-Chiari syndrome]]

==Cysts==
* [[Congenital]] cystic disease of the liver
* [[Cyst]]s caused by [[Echinococcus]]
* [[Polycystic_liver_disease]]

==Others==
[[Amyloid]] degeneration of liver

==Gallbladder and biliary tract diseases==

* [[malignant]] [[Gall bladder#Gallbladder Cancer|neoplasm of the gallbladder]]
* malignant neoplasm of other parts of biliary tract
** extrahepatic bile duct
** [[ampulla of Vater]]

* [[cholelithiasis]]
* [[cholecystitis]]
* others (excluding [[postcholecystectomy syndrome]]), but including
** other obstructions of the gallbladder (like strictures)
** [[Edema|hydrops]], [[perforation]], [[fistula]]
** [[cholesterolosis]]
** [[biliary dyskinesia]]
* K83: other diseases of the [[biliary tract]]:
** [[cholangitis]] (including [[ascending cholangitis]] and [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]])
** obstruction, [[perforation]], [[fistula]] of [[biliary tract]]
** [[spasm]] of [[sphincter of Oddi]]
** biliary [[cyst]]
** [[biliary atresia]]

==Diagnosis==
In hepatology, important indicators include: 
* history of [[alcohol abuse]]
* [[liver function tests]]
* [[hepatomegaly]]
* [[hypoalbuminemia]] and [[ascites]]
* [[jaundice]] (or icterus)
* [[Murphy's sign]]
* [[liver biopsy]]

==Treatment==
Includes:
* motivate patient to stop drinking [[alcohol]]
* [[vaccination]] for [[hepatitis]]
* eradication of causative pathogens
* [[Liver#Liver transplantation|liver transplantion]]
* [[cholecystectomy]]
