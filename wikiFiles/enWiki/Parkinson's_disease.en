'''Parkinson's disease''' (also known as '''Parkinson disease''', '''Parkinson's''', '''idiopathic parkinsonism''', '''primary [[parkinsonism]]''', '''PD''', '''hypokinetic rigid syndrome/HRS''', or '''paralysis agitans''') is a [[Neurodegeneration|degenerative]] disorder of the [[central nervous system]].  The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease result from the death of [[dopamine]]-generating cells in the [[substantia nigra]], a region of the [[midbrain]]; the cause of this cell death is unknown. Early in the course of the disease, the most obvious symptoms are [[motor skill|movement-related]]; these include [[tremor|shaking]], [[Spasticity|rigidity]], [[bradykinesia|slowness of movement]] and difficulty with walking and [[gait]]. Later, [[Cognition|cognitive]] and behavioural problems may arise, with [[dementia]] commonly occurring in the advanced stages of the disease.  Other symptoms include sensory, sleep and emotional problems. PD is more common in the elderly, with most cases occurring after the age of 50. 

The main motor symptoms are collectively called [[parkinsonism]], or a "parkinsonian syndrome". Parkinson's disease is often defined as a parkinsonian syndrome that is [[idiopathic]] (having no known cause), although some atypical cases have a [[genetics|genetic]] origin. Many risk and protective factors have been investigated:  the clearest evidence is for an increased risk of PD in people exposed to certain pesticides and a reduced risk in tobacco smokers.  The [[pathology]] of the disease is characterized by the accumulation of a protein called [[alpha-synuclein]] into [[inclusion bodies|inclusions]] called [[Lewy bodies]] in neurons, and from insufficient formation and activity of [[dopamine]] produced in certain [[neuron]]s within parts of the [[midbrain]]. Lewy bodies are the pathological hallmark of the idiopathic disorder, and the distribution of the Lewy bodies throughout the Parkinsonian brain varies from one individual to another.  The anatomical distribution of the Lewy bodies is often directly related to the expression and degree of the clinical symptoms of each individual. Diagnosis of typical cases is mainly based on symptoms, with tests such as [[neuroimaging]] being used for confirmation.

Modern treatments are effective at managing the early motor symptoms of the disease, mainly through the use of [[levodopa]] and [[dopamine agonist]]s.  As the disease progresses and dopaminergic neurons continue to be lost, these drugs eventually become ineffective at treating the symptoms and at the same time produce a complication called [[dyskinesia]], marked by involuntary writhing movements.  Diet and some forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at alleviating symptoms.  Surgery and [[deep brain stimulation]] have been used to reduce motor symptoms as a last resort in severe cases where drugs are ineffective. Research directions include investigations into new [[animal model]]s of the disease and of the potential usefulness of gene therapy, [[stem cell]] transplants and [[neuroprotective]] agents.  Medications to treat non-movement-related symptoms of PD, such as sleep disturbances and emotional problems, also exist. 

The disease is named after the English doctor [[James Parkinson]], who published the first detailed description in ''An Essay on the Shaking Palsy'' in 1817. Several major organizations promote research and improvement of quality of life of those with the disease and their families. Public awareness campaigns include Parkinson's disease day (on the birthday of James Parkinson, April 11) and the use of a red tulip as the symbol of the disease. People with parkinsonism who have increased the public's awareness include [[Michael J. Fox]] and [[Muhammad Ali]].

==Classification==
The term [[parkinsonism]] is used for a motor [[syndrome]] whose main symptoms are tremor at rest, stiffness, slowing of movement and postural instability. Parkinsonian syndromes can be divided into four subtypes according to their origin: primary or [[idiopathic]], secondary or acquired, hereditary parkinsonism, and [[parkinson plus syndrome]]s or multiple system degeneration.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Parkinson's disease is the most common form of parkinsonism and is usually defined as "primary" parkinsonism, meaning parkinsonism with no external identifiable cause.<ref name="pmid15172778"/><ref name="Jankovic_book-Epidemiology">{{cite book |author=Schrag A |chapter=Epidemiology of movement disorders |editor=Tolosa E, Jankovic JJ| title=Parkinson's disease and movement disorders |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, Maryland |year=2007 |pages= 50–66 |isbn=0-7817-7881-6}}</ref> In recent years several genes that are directly related to some cases of Parkinson's disease have been discovered. As much as this conflicts with the definition of Parkinson's disease as an idiopathic illness, genetic parkinsonism disorders with a similar clinical course to PD are generally included under the Parkinson's disease label. The terms "familial Parkinson's disease" and "sporadic Parkinson's disease" can be used to differentiate genetic from truly idiopathic forms of the disease.<ref name="pmid18398010"/>

Usually classified as a [[movement disorder]], PD also gives rise to several non-motor types of symptoms such as sensory deficits,<ref name="pmid20206672">{{cite journal |author=Barnett-Cowan M, Dyde RT, Foxe SH, Moro E, Hutchison WD, Harris LR |title=Multisensory determinants of orientation perception in Parkinson's disease |journal=Neuroscience |volume=167 |issue=4 |pages=1138–50 |year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20206672 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2010.02.065 }}</ref> cognitive difficulties or sleep problems. [[Parkinson plus syndrome|Parkinson plus diseases]] are primary parkinsonisms which present additional features.<ref name="pmid15172778"/> They include [[multiple system atrophy]], [[progressive supranuclear palsy]], [[corticobasal degeneration]] and [[dementia with Lewy bodies]].<ref name="pmid15172778">{{cite journal |author=Samii A, Nutt JG, Ransom BR |title=Parkinson's disease |journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9423 |pages=1783–93 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15172778 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16305-8 }}</ref><ref name="pmid20506312">{{cite journal |journal=Human Mutatation |date=2010 Jul |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=763–80 |title=Genetic etiology of Parkinson disease associated with mutations in the SNCA, PARK2, PINK1, PARK7, and LRRK2 genes: a mutation update |author=Nuytemans K, Theuns J, Cruts M, Van Broeckhoven C |pmid=20506312 |pmc=3056147 |doi=10.1002/humu.21277 }}</ref>

In terms of [[pathophysiology]], PD is considered a [[synuclein]]opathy due to an abnormal accumulation of [[alpha-synuclein]] protein in the brain in the form of [[Lewy body|Lewy bodies]], as opposed to other diseases such as [[Alzheimer's disease]] where the brain accumulates [[tau protein]] in the form of [[neurofibrillary tangle]]s.<ref name="pmid16489609">{{cite journal |author=Galpern WR, Lang AE |title=Interface between tauopathies and synucleinopathies: a tale of two proteins |journal=Ann.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is another synucleinopathy that has similarities with PD, and especially with the subset of PD cases with dementia.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Main|Signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease}}
Parkinson's disease affects movement, producing motor symptoms.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Non-motor symptoms, which include [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic dysfunction]], [[neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatric]] problems (mood, cognition, behavior or thought alterations), and sensory and sleep difficulties, are also common. Some of these non-motor symptoms are often present at the time of diagnosis and can precede motor symptoms.<ref name=Jankovic2008/>

[[Tremor]] is the most apparent and well-known symptom.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> It is the most common; though around 30% of individuals with PD do not have tremor at disease onset, most develop it as the disease progresses.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> It is usually a rest tremor:  maximal when the limb is at rest and disappearing with voluntary movement and sleep.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> It affects to a greater extent the most [[distal]] part of the limb and at onset typically appears in only a single arm or leg, becoming bilateral later.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Frequency of PD tremor is between 4 and 6 [[hertz]] (cycles per second). A feature of tremor is ''pill-rolling'', the tendency of the index finger of the hand to get into contact with the thumb and perform together a circular movement.<ref name=Jankovic2008/><ref name="Cooper"/> The term derives from the similarity between the movement in PD patients and the earlier pharmaceutical technique of manually making pills.<ref name="Cooper">{{cite book |author=Cooper G, Eichhorn G, Rodnitzky RL|chapter=Parkinson's disease |editor=Conn PM| title=Neuroscience in medicine|publisher=Humana Press|location=Totowa, NJ|year=2008 |pages= 508–512|isbn=978-1-60327-454-8}}</ref>

[[Bradykinesia]] (slowness of movement) is another characteristic feature of PD, and is associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation and finally execution of a movement.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Performance of sequential and simultaneous movement is hindered.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Bradykinesia is commonly a very disabling symptom in the early stages of the disease.<ref name="pmid15172778"/> Initial manifestations are problems when performing daily tasks which require fine motor control such as writing, sewing or getting dressed.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Clinical evaluation is based in similar tasks such as alternating movements between both hands or both feet.<ref name="pmid15172778"/> Bradykinesia is not equal for all movements or times.

[[Hypokinesia|Rigidity]] is stiffness and resistance to limb movement caused by increased [[muscle tone]], an excessive and continuous contraction of muscles.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> In parkinsonism the rigidity can be uniform (lead-pipe rigidity) or ratchety (cogwheel rigidity).<ref name=Jankovic2008/><ref name="pmid15172778"/><ref name="Banich">{{cite book |author=Banich MT, Compton RJ|chapter=Motor control | title=Cognitive neuroscience|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage learning|location=Belmont, CA|year=2011 |pages= 108–44|isbn=0-8400-3298-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine|page=486 |date=2007-01-04 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |last1= Longmore|first1=Murray|last2= Wilkinson|first2=Ian B.|last3= Turmezei|first3=Tom|last4=Cheung|first4=Chee Kay |isbn=978-0-19-856837-7}}</ref> The combination of tremor and increased tone is considered to be at the origin of cogwheel rigidity.<ref name="Jankovic_book-Rigidity">{{cite book |author=Fung VSC, Thompson PD|chapter=Rigidity and spasticity |editor=Tolosa E, Jankovic JJ| title=Parkinson's disease and movement disorders|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2007 |pages= 504–13|isbn=0-7817-7881-6}}</ref> Rigidity may be associated with joint pain; such pain being a frequent initial manifestation of the disease.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> In early stages of Parkinson's disease, rigidity is often asymmetrical and it tends to affect the neck and shoulder muscles prior to the muscles of the face and extremities.<ref>{{cite book |last1=O'Sullivan |first1=Susan B |last2=Schmitz |first2=Thomas J |title=Physical Rehabilitation |edition=5th |chapter=Parkinson's Disease |year=2007|publisher=F.A.

Memory is affected, specifically in [[Recall (memory)|recalling]] learned information. Nevertheless, improvement appears when recall is aided by cues. Visuospatial difficulties are also part of the disease, seen for example when the individual is asked to perform tests of facial recognition and perception of the orientation of drawn lines.<ref name="pmid18175397"/>

==Causes==
{{Main|Causes of Parkinson's disease}}
[[File:Protein PARK2 PDB 1iyf.png|thumb|left|[[Protein Data Bank|PDB]] rendering of [[Parkin (ligase)]]]]
Most people with Parkinson's disease have [[idiopathic]] Parkinson's disease (having no specific known cause). A small proportion of cases, however, can be attributed to known genetic factors. Other factors have been associated with the risk of developing PD, but no causal relationships have been proven.

PD traditionally has been considered a non-genetic disorder; however, around 15% of individuals with PD have a first-degree relative who has the disease.<ref name="pmid15172778"/>  At least 5% of people are now known to have forms of the disease that occur because of a mutation of one of several specific genes.<ref name=lesage>{{cite journal |author=Lesage S, Brice A |title=Parkinson's disease: from monogenic forms to genetic susceptibility factors |journal=Hum.

Mutations in specific genes have been conclusively shown to cause PD. These genes code for [[alpha-synuclein]] (SNCA), [[Parkin (ligase)|parkin]] (PRKN), leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ([[LRRK2]] or dardarin), PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 ([[PINK1]]), [[PARK7|DJ-1]] and [[ATP13A2]].<ref name="pmid18398010">{{cite journal |author=Davie CA |title=A review of Parkinson's disease |journal=Br.

With the exception of LRRK2, however, they account for only a small minority of cases of PD.<ref name="pmid18398010"/> The most extensively studied PD-related genes are SNCA and LRRK2. Mutations in genes including SNCA, LRRK2 and [[glucocerebrosidase]] (GBA) have been found to be risk factors for sporadic PD. Mutations in GBA are known to cause [[Gaucher's disease]].<ref name=lesage/> [[Genome-wide association study|Genome-wide association studies]], which search for mutated [[allele]]s with low penetrance in sporadic cases, have now yielded many positive results.<ref name=IPDGC>{{cite journal |author=IPDGC |title=Imputation of sequence variants for identification of genetic risks for Parkinson's disease: a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies |journal=Lancet |volume=377 |pages= 641–649 |year=2011 |pmid= 21292315 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62345-8 |issue=9766 |last2=Nalls |first2=MA |last3=Plagnol |first3=V |last4=Hernandez |first4=DG |last5=Sharma |first5=M |last6=Sheerin |first6=UM |last7=Saad |first7=M |last8=Simón-Sánchez |first8=J |last9=Schulte |first9=C}}</ref> 

The role of the SNCA gene is important in PD because the alpha-synuclein protein is the main component of [[Lewy body|Lewy bodies]].<ref name=lesage/> [[Missense mutation]]s of the gene (in which a single [[nucleotide]] is changed), and [[Gene duplication|duplications]] and triplications of the [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] containing it have been found in different groups with familial PD.<ref name=lesage/> Missense mutations are rare.<ref name=lesage/> On the other hand, multiplications of the SNCA locus account for around 2% of familial cases.<ref name=lesage/> Multiplications have been found in [[asymptomatic carrier]]s, which indicate that [[penetrance]] is incomplete or age-dependent.<ref name=lesage/>

The LRRK2 gene (PARK8) encodes for a protein called [[dardarin]]. The name dardarin was taken from a [[Basque language|Basque]] word for tremor, because this gene was first identified in families from England and the north of Spain.<ref name="pmid18398010"/> Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common known cause of familial and sporadic PD, accounting for approximately 5% of individuals with a family history of the disease and 3% of sporadic cases.<ref name="pmid18398010"/><ref name=lesage/> There are many different mutations described in LRRK2, however unequivocal proof of causation only exists for a small number.<ref name=lesage/>

The primary symptoms of Parkinson's disease result from greatly reduced activity of [[dopamine]]-secreting cells caused by cell death in the [[pars compacta]] region of the [[substantia nigra]].<ref name="pmid18781672"/> 

There are five major pathways in the brain connecting other brain areas with the basal ganglia. These are known as the motor, oculo-motor, associative, [[Limbic system|limbic]] and [[orbitofrontal]] circuits, with names indicating the main projection area of each circuit.<ref name="pmid18781672"/> All of them are affected in PD, and their disruption explains many of the symptoms of the disease since these circuits are involved in a wide variety of functions including movement, attention and learning.<ref name="pmid18781672"/> Scientifically, the motor circuit has been examined the most intensively.<ref name="pmid18781672"/>

A particular conceptual model of the motor circuit and its alteration with PD has been of great influence since 1980, although some limitations have been pointed out which have led to modifications.<ref name="pmid18781672"/> In this model, the basal ganglia normally exert a constant inhibitory influence on a wide range of motor systems, preventing them from becoming active at inappropriate times. When a decision is made to perform a particular action, inhibition is reduced for the required motor system, thereby releasing it for activation. Dopamine acts to facilitate this release of inhibition, so high levels of dopamine function tend to promote motor activity, while low levels of dopamine function, such as occur in PD, demand greater exertions of effort for any given movement. Thus the net effect of dopamine depletion is to produce [[hypokinesia]], an overall reduction in motor output.<ref name="pmid18781672"/>  Drugs that are used to treat PD, conversely, may produce excessive dopamine activity, allowing motor systems to be activated at inappropriate times and thereby producing [[dyskinesia]]s.<ref name="pmid18781672"/>

===Brain cell death===
There is speculation of several mechanisms by which the brain cells could be lost.<ref name="pmid20495568"/> One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein [[alpha-synuclein]] bound to [[ubiquitin]] in the damaged cells. This insoluble [[protein]] accumulates inside neurones forming inclusions called [[Lewy bodies]].<ref name="pmid18398010"/><ref name="pmid20563819">{{cite journal |author=Schulz-Schaeffer WJ |title=The synaptic pathology of alpha-synuclein aggregation in dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia |journal=Acta Neuropathol. |volume=120 |issue=2 |pages=131–43 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20563819 |pmc=2892607 |doi=10.1007/s00401-010-0711-0 |url=}}</ref> According to the [[Braak staging]], a classification of the disease based on pathological findings, Lewy bodies first appear in the [[olfactory bulb]], [[medulla oblongata]] and [[pontine tegmentum]], with individuals at this stage being asymptomatic. As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies later develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the [[midbrain]] and basal [[forebrain]], and in a last step the [[neocortex]].<ref name="pmid18398010"/> These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD; however, Lewy bodies may not cause cell death and they may be protective.<ref name="pmid20495568"/><ref name="pmid20563819"/> In patients with dementia, a generalized presence of Lewy bodies is common in cortical areas. [[Neurofibrillary tangles]] and [[senile plaque]]s, characteristic of [[Alzheimer's disease]], are not common unless the person is demented.<ref name="Jankovic_book-Neuropathology"/>

Other cell-death mechanisms include [[proteosome|proteosomal]] and [[Lysosome|lysosomal]] system dysfunction and reduced [[mitochondria]]l activity.<ref name="pmid20495568"/> Iron accumulation in the substantia nigra is typically observed in conjunction with the protein inclusions. It may be related to [[oxidative stress]], [[protein aggregation]] and neuronal death, but the mechanisms are not fully understood.<ref name="pmid20082992">{{cite journal |author=Hirsch EC |title=Iron transport in Parkinson's disease |journal=Parkinsonism Relat.

A physician will diagnose Parkinson's disease from the [[medical history]] and a [[neurological examination]].<ref name=Jankovic2008/> There is no lab test that will clearly identify the disease, but brain scans are sometimes used to rule out disorders that could give rise to similar symptoms. Patients may be given levodopa and resulting relief of motor impairment tends to confirm diagnosis. The finding of [[Lewy bodies]] in the midbrain on [[autopsy]] is usually considered proof that the patient suffered from Parkinson's disease. The progress of the illness over time may reveal it is not Parkinson's disease, and some authorities recommend that the diagnosis be periodically reviewed.<ref name=Jankovic2008/><ref name="Nice-Diagnosis">{{cite book |chapter=Diagnosing Parkinson's Disease |editor=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions| title=Parkinson's Disease| url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English| publisher=Royal College of Physicians|location=London| year=2006| isbn= 1-86016-283-5|pages= 29–47}}</ref> 

Other causes that can secondarily produce a parkinsonian syndrome are [[Alzheimer's disease]], multiple [[cerebral infarction]] and drug-induced parkinsonism.<ref name="Nice-Diagnosis"/> [[Parkinson plus syndrome]]s such as [[progressive supranuclear palsy]] and [[multiple system atrophy]] must be ruled out.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Anti-Parkinson's medications are typically less effective at controlling symptoms in Parkinson plus syndromes.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Faster progression rates, early cognitive dysfunction or postural instability, minimal tremor or symmetry at onset may indicate a Parkinson plus disease rather than PD itself.<ref name="pmid12464118">{{cite journal |author=Poewe W, Wenning G |title=The differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease |journal=Eur.

Medical organizations have created [[diagnostic criteria]] to ease and standardize the diagnostic process, especially in the early stages of the disease. The most widely known criteria come from the UK [[Parkinson's UK|Parkinson's Disease Society]] Brain Bank and the U.S. [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]].<ref name=Jankovic2008/>  The PD Society Brain Bank criteria require slowness of movement (bradykinesia) plus either rigidity, resting tremor, or postural instability. Other possible causes for these symptoms need to be ruled out. Finally, three or more of the following features are required during onset or evolution: unilateral onset, tremor at rest, progression in time, asymmetry of motor symptoms, response to levodopa for at least five years, clinical course of at least ten years and appearance of [[dyskinesia]]s induced by the intake of excessive levodopa.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Accuracy of diagnostic criteria evaluated at autopsy is 75–90%, with specialists such as neurologists having the highest rates.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> 

[[Computed tomography]] (CT) and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) brain scans of people with PD usually appear normal.<ref name="pmid20351351">{{cite journal |author=Brooks DJ |title=Imaging approaches to Parkinson disease |journal=J. Nucl. Med. |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=596–609 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20351351 |doi=10.2967/jnumed.108.059998 }}</ref> These techniques are nevertheless useful to rule out other diseases that can be secondary causes of parkinsonism, such as basal ganglia [[tumor]]s, [[vascular]] pathology and [[hydrocephalus]].<ref name="pmid20351351"/> A specific technique of MRI, [[diffusion MRI]], has been reported to be useful at discriminating between typical and atypical parkinsonism, although its exact diagnostic value is still under investigation.<ref name="pmid20351351"/> Dopaminergic function in the basal ganglia can be measured with different [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[Single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]] [[radiotracer]]s.

==Management==
{{Main|Management of Parkinson's disease}}
There is no cure for Parkinson's disease, but medications, surgery and multidisciplinary management can provide relief from the symptoms. The main families of drugs useful for treating motor symptoms are levodopa (usually combined with a [[dopa decarboxylase inhibitor]] or [[COMT inhibitor]]), [[dopamine agonist]]s and [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO-B inhibitors]].<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> The stage of the disease determines which group is most useful. Two stages are usually distinguished: an initial stage in which the individual with PD has already developed some disability for which he needs pharmacological treatment, then a second stage in which an individual develops motor complications related to levodopa usage.<ref name="Nice-pharma">{{cite book |chapter= Symptomatic pharmacological therapy in Parkinson’s disease|editor=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions| title=Parkinson's Disease| url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English| publisher=Royal College of Physicians|location=London| year=2006| isbn= 1-86016-283-5|pages= 59–100}}</ref> Treatment in the initial stage aims for an optimal tradeoff between good symptom control and side-effects resulting from improvement of dopaminergic function. The start of levodopa (or [[L-DOPA]]) treatment may be delayed by using other medications such as MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists, in the hope of delaying the onset of dyskinesias.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> In the second stage the aim is to reduce symptoms while controlling fluctuations of the response to medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or overuse have to be managed.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> When medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery and deep brain stimulation can be of use.<ref name="pmid20937936"/> In the final stages of the disease, [[palliative care]] is provided to improve quality of life.<ref name="Nice-palliative"/>

===Levodopa===
Levodopa has been the most widely used treatment for over 30 years.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> L-DOPA is converted into dopamine in the dopaminergic neurons by [[Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase|dopa decarboxylase]].<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Since motor symptoms are produced by a lack of dopamine in the substantia nigra, the administration of L-DOPA temporarily diminishes the motor symptoms.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/>

Only 5–10% of L-DOPA crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]]. The remainder is often metabolized to dopamine elsewhere, causing a variety of side effects including [[nausea]], [[dyskinesia]]s and joint stiffness.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> [[Carbidopa]] and [[benserazide]] are  peripheral [[dopa decarboxylase inhibitor]]s,<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> which help to prevent the metabolism of L-DOPA before it reaches the dopaminergic neurons, therefore reducing side effects and increasing [[bioavailability]]. They are generally given as combination preparations with levodopa.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Existing preparations are [[carbidopa/levodopa]] (co-careldopa) and [[benserazide|benserazide/levodopa]] (co-beneldopa). Levodopa has been related to [[dopamine dysregulation syndrome]], which is a compulsive overuse of the medication, and [[wikt:punding|punding]].<ref name="pmid20123548"/> There are controlled [[Slow-release|release]] versions of levodopa in the form [[intravenous]] and intestinal infusions that spread out the effect of the medication. These slow-release levodopa preparations have not shown an increased control of motor symptoms or motor complications when compared to immediate release preparations.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/><ref name="Jankovic_book-Pharma">{{cite book |author=Tolosa E, Katzenschlager R|chapter=Pharmacological management of Parkinson's disease|editor=Tolosa E, Jankovic JJ| title=Parkinson's disease and movement disorders|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2007 |pages= 110–45|isbn=0-7817-7881-6}}</ref>

[[Tolcapone]] inhibits the [[COMT]] enzyme, which degrades dopamine, thereby prolonging the effects of levodopa.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> It has been used to complement levodopa; however, its usefulness is limited by possible side effects such as liver damage.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> A similarly effective drug, [[entacapone]], has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Licensed preparations of entacapone contain entacapone alone or in combination with carbidopa and levodopa.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/>

Levodopa preparations lead in the long term to the development of motor complications characterized by involuntary movements called [[dyskinesia]]s and fluctuations in the response to medication.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> When this occurs a person with PD can change from phases with good response to medication and few symptoms ("on" state), to phases with no response to medication and significant motor symptoms ("off" state).<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> For this reason, levodopa doses are kept as low as possible while maintaining functionality.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Delaying the initiation of therapy with levodopa by using alternatives (dopamine agonists and MAO-B inhibitors) is common practice.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> A former strategy to reduce motor complications was to withdraw L-DOPA medication for some time. This is discouraged now, since it can bring dangerous side effects such as [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Most people with PD will eventually need levodopa and later develop motor side effects.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/>

===Dopamine agonists===
Several [[dopamine agonist]]s that bind to dopaminergic post-synaptic receptors in the brain have similar effects to levodopa.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> These were initially used for individuals experiencing on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias as a complementary therapy to levodopa; they are now mainly used on their own as an initial therapy for motor symptoms with the aim of delaying motor complications.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Goldenberg MM |title=Medical management of Parkinson's disease |journal=P & T |volume=33 |issue=10 |pages=590–606 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=19750042 |pmc=2730785}}</ref> When used in late PD they are useful at reducing the off periods.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Dopamine agonists include [[bromocriptine]], [[pergolide]], [[pramipexole]], [[ropinirole]], [[piribedil]], [[cabergoline]], [[apomorphine]] and [[lisuride]].

Dopamine agonists produce significant, although usually mild, side effects including [[somnolence|drowsiness]], hallucinations, insomnia, nausea and constipation.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Sometimes side effects appear even at a minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician to search for a different drug.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Compared with levodopa, dopamine agonists may delay motor complications of medication use but are less effective at controlling symptoms.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Nevertheless, they are usually effective enough to manage symptoms in the initial years.<ref name="pmid15172778"/> They tend to be more expensive than levodopa.<ref name="pmid15172778"/> Dyskinesias due to dopamine agonists are rare in younger people who have PD, but along with other side effects, become more common with age at onset.<ref name="pmid15172778"/> Thus dopamine agonists are the preferred initial treatment for earlier onset, as opposed to levodopa in later onset.<ref name="pmid15172778"/> Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity and eating, and pathological gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa.<ref name="pmid20123548"/> 

[[Apomorphine]], a non-orally administered dopamine agonist, may be used to reduce off periods and dyskinesia in late PD.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> It is administered by intermittent injections or continuous [[subcutaneous infusion]]s.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are common, individuals receiving apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Two dopamine agonists that are administered through skin patches ([[lisuride]] and [[rotigotine]]) have been recently found to be useful for patients in initial stages and preliminary positive results has been published on the control of off states in patients in the advanced state.<ref name="Jankovic_book-Pharma"/>

=== MAO-B inhibitors ===
[[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO-B inhibitor]]s ([[selegiline]] and [[rasagiline]]) increase the level of dopamine in the basal ganglia by blocking its metabolism. They inhibit monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) which breaks down dopamine secreted by the dopaminergic neurons. The reduction in MAO-B activity results in increased L-DOPA in the [[striatum]].<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> Like dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors used as monotherapy improve motor symptoms and delay the need for levodopa in early disease, but produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa. There are few studies of their effectiveness in the advanced stage, although results suggest that they are useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> An initial study indicated that selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, but this was later disproven.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/>

===Other drugs===
Other drugs such as [[amantadine]] and [[anticholinergic]]s may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms. However, the evidence supporting them lacks quality, so they are not first choice treatments.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> In addition to motor symptoms, PD is accompanied by a diverse range of symptoms.

===Surgery===
[[File:Parkinson surgery.jpg|upright|thumb|Placement of an electrode into the brain. The head is stabilised in a frame for [[stereotactic surgery]]. ]]

Target areas for DBS or lesions include the [[thalamus]], the [[globus pallidus]]  or the [[subthalamic nucleus]].<ref name="Nice-surgery"/> [[Deep brain stimulation]] (DBS) is the most commonly used surgical treatment. It involves the implantation of a medical device called a [[brain pacemaker]], which sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain. DBS is recommended for people who have PD who suffer from motor fluctuations and tremor inadequately controlled by medication, or to those who are intolerant to medication, as long as they do not have severe [[wikt:neuropsychiatric|neuropsychiatric]] problems.<ref name="pmid20937936">{{cite journal |author=Bronstein JM, Tagliati M, Alterman RL, ''et al.'' |title=Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson disease: an expert consensus and review of key issues |journal=Arch.

===Palliative care===
[[Palliative care]] is often required in the final stages of the disease when all other treatment strategies have become ineffective. The aim of palliative care is to maximize the [[quality of life]] for the person with the disease and those surrounding him or her. Some central issues of palliative care are: care in the community while adequate care can be given there, reducing or withdrawing drug intake to reduce drug side effects, preventing [[pressure ulcer]]s by management of pressure areas of inactive patients, and facilitating [[end-of-life care|end-of-life]] decisions for the patient as well as involved friends and relatives.<ref name="Nice-palliative">{{cite book | chapter=Palliative care in Parkinson’s disease | editor=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions | title=Parkinson's Disease  | url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English | publisher=Royal College of Physicians | location=London | year=2006 | isbn=1-86016-283-5 | pages=147–51 }}</ref>

=== Other treatments ===
Muscles and nerves that control the digestive process may be affected by PD, resulting in [[constipation]] and [[gastroparesis]] (food remaining in the stomach for a longer period of time than normal).<ref name="pmid19691125"/> A balanced diet, based on periodical nutritional assessments, is recommended and should be designed to avoid weight loss or gain and minimize consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction.<ref name="pmid19691125"/> As the disease advances, swallowing difficulties ([[dysphagia]]) may appear. In such cases it may be helpful to use [[thickening agent]]s for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating, both measures reducing the risk of choking. [[Gastrostomy]] to deliver food directly into the stomach is possible in severe cases.<ref name="pmid19691125"/>

Levodopa and [[protein]]s use the same transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, thereby competing for access.<ref name="pmid19691125"/> When they are taken together, this results in a reduced effectiveness of the drug.<ref name="pmid19691125"/> Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive [[Protein (nutrient)|protein consumption]] is discouraged and well balanced [[Mediterranean diet]] is recommended. In advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons.<ref name="pmid19691125">{{cite journal |author=Barichella M, Cereda E, Pezzoli G |title=Major nutritional issues in the management of Parkinson's disease|journal=Mov.

PD invariably progresses with time. The [[Hoehn and Yahr scale]], which defines five stages of progression, is commonly used to estimate the progress of the disease.

Motor symptoms, if not treated, advance aggressively in the early stages of the disease and more slowly later. Untreated, individuals are expected to lose independent [[ambulation]] after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten years.<ref name="pmid17131223"/> However, it is uncommon to find untreated people nowadays. Medication has improved the prognosis of motor symptoms, while at the same time it is a new source of disability because of the undesired effects of levodopa after years of use.<ref name="pmid17131223"/> In people taking levodopa, the progression time of symptoms to a stage of high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years.<ref name="pmid17131223"/> However, it is hard to predict what course the disease will take for a given individual.<ref name="pmid17131223"/> Age is the best predictor of disease progression.<ref name="pmid20495568"/> The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis, while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset.<ref name="pmid20495568"/>

Since current therapies improve motor symptoms, disability at present is mainly related to non-motor features of the disease.<ref name="pmid20495568"/> Nevertheless, the relationship between disease progression and disability is not linear. Disability is initially related to motor symptoms.<ref name="pmid17131223">{{cite journal |author=Poewe W |title=The natural history of Parkinson's disease |journal=J. Neurol. |volume=253 |issue=Suppl 7 |pages=VII2–6 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17131223 |doi=10.1007/s00415-006-7002-7 }}</ref> As the disease advances, disability is more related to motor symptoms that do not respond adequately to medication, such as swallowing/speech difficulties, and gait/balance problems;  and also to motor complications, which appear in up to 50% of individuals after 5 years of levodopa usage.<ref name="pmid17131223"/> Finally, after ten years most people with the disease have autonomic disturbances, sleep problems, mood alterations and cognitive decline.<ref name="pmid17131223"/> All of these symptoms, especially cognitive decline, greatly increase disability.<ref name="pmid20495568"/><ref name="pmid17131223"/>

The [[life expectancy]] of people with PD is reduced.<ref name="pmid17131223"/> [[Standardized mortality ratio|Mortality ratios]] are around twice those of unaffected people.<ref name="pmid17131223"/> Cognitive decline and dementia, old age at onset, a more advanced disease state and presence of swallowing problems are all mortality [[risk factor]]s.  On the other hand a disease pattern mainly characterized by tremor as opposed to rigidity predicts an improved survival.<ref name="pmid17131223"/> Death from [[aspiration pneumonia]] is twice as common in individuals with PD as in the healthy population.<ref name="pmid17131223"/>

==Epidemiology==
PD is the second most common [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative disorder]] after [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name="pmid16713924">{{cite journal |author=de Lau LM, Breteler MM |title=Epidemiology of Parkinson's disease |journal=Lancet Neurol. |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=525–35 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16713924 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(06)70471-9 }}</ref> The [[prevalence]] (proportion in a population at a given time) of PD is about 0.3% of the whole population in industrialized countries. PD is more common in the elderly and prevalence rises from 1% in those over 60 years of age to 4% of the population over 80.<ref name="pmid16713924"/> The mean age of onset is around 60 years, although 5–10% of cases, classified as young onset, begin between the ages of 20 and 50.<ref name="pmid15172778"/> PD may be less prevalent in those of African and Asian ancestry, although this finding is disputed.<ref name="pmid16713924"/> Some studies have proposed that it is more common in men than women, but others failed to detect any differences between the two sexes.<ref name="pmid16713924"/> The [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of PD is between 8 and 18 per 100,000 person–years.<ref name="pmid16713924"/>

Many risk factors and protective factors have been proposed, sometimes in relation to theories concerning possible mechanisms of the disease, however none have been conclusively related to PD by empirical evidence. When epidemiological studies have been carried out in order to test the relationship between a given factor and PD, they have often been flawed and their results have in some cases been contradictory.<ref name="pmid16713924"/> The most frequently replicated relationships are an increased risk of PD in those exposed to pesticides, and a reduced risk in smokers.<ref name="pmid16713924"/>

Injections of the synthetic neurotoxin [[MPTP]] produce a range of symptoms similar to those of PD as well as selective damage to the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. This observation has led to theorizing that exposure to some environmental toxins may increase the risk of having PD.<ref name="pmid16713924"/> Exposure to toxins that have been consistently related to the disease can double the risk of PD, and include certain [[pesticide]]s, such as  [[rotenone]] or [[paraquat]], and [[herbicide]]s, such as [[Agent Orange]].<ref name="pmid16713924"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Tanner CM, Kamel F, Ross GW, ''et al.'' |title=Rotenone, Paraquat and Parkinson's Disease |journal=[[Environ Health Perspect]] |year=2011 |month=January |pmid=21269927 |doi=10.1289/ehp.1002839 |volume=119 |issue=6 |pmc=3114824 |pages=866–72}}</ref><ref name="Veterans"/> Indirect measures of exposure, such as living in rural environments, have been found to increase the risk of PD.<ref name="Veterans">{{cite book |chapter= Neurologic disorders|editor=IOM (Institute of Medicine)| title=Veterans and Agent Orange: Update 2008| url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12662| publisher=The National Academies press|location=Washington D.C.| year=2009| isbn=0-309-13884-1|pages= 510–45}}</ref> [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|Heavy metals]] exposure has been proposed to be a risk factor, through possible accumulation in the substantia nigra; however, studies on the issue have been inconclusive.<ref name="pmid16713924"/>

==Research==
{{See also|Parkinson's disease clinical research}}
There is little prospect of dramatic new PD treatments expected in a short time frame.<ref name=Dimond/> Currently active research directions include the search for new [[animal model]]s of the disease and studies of the potential usefulness of [[gene therapy]], [[stem cell]] transplants and [[neuroprotective]] agents.<ref name="pmid20495568"/>

===Animal models===
PD is not known to occur naturally in any species other than humans, although animal models which show some features of the disease are used in research. The appearance of parkinsonian symptoms in a group of drug addicts in the early 1980s who consumed a contaminated batch of the synthetic [[opiate]] [[MPPP]] led to the discovery of the chemical [[MPTP]] as an agent that causes a parkinsonian syndrome in non-human primates as well as in humans.<ref name="pmid6823561">{{cite journal |author=Langston JW, Ballard P, Tetrud JW, Irwin I |title=Chronic Parkinsonism in humans due to a product of meperidine-analog synthesis |journal=Science |volume=219 |issue=4587 |pages=979–80|year=1983 |month=February |pmid=6823561 |doi= 10.1126/science.6823561|url=}}</ref> Other predominant toxin-based models employ the insecticide [[rotenone]], the herbicide [[paraquat]] and the fungicide [[maneb]].<ref name="pmid19729209">{{cite journal|author=Cicchetti F, Drouin-Ouellet J, Gross RE |title=Environmental toxins and Parkinson's disease: what have we learned from pesticide-induced animal models? |journal=Trends Pharmacol.

[[Transgenic]] rodent models that replicate various aspects of PD have been developed.<ref name="pmid18642640">{{cite journal |author=Harvey BK, Wang Y, Hoffer BJ |title=Transgenic rodent models of Parkinson's disease |journal=Acta Neurochir.

===Gene therapy===
Gene therapy involves the use of a non-infectious [[virus]] to shuttle a gene into a part of the brain. The gene used leads to the production of an [[enzyme]] that helps to manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from further damage.<ref name="pmid20495568"/><ref name="pmid20155994">{{cite journal |author=Feng, LR, Maguire-Zeiss KA |title=Gene Therapy in Parkinson's Disease: Rationale and Current Status |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=24 |issue=3|pages=177–92 |year=2010|pmid=20155994 |pmc=2886503|doi=10.2165/11533740-000000000-00000}}</ref> In 2010 there were four clinical trials using gene therapy in PD.<ref name="pmid20495568"/> There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of gene therapy is still unknown.<ref name="pmid20495568"/> One of these reported positive results in 2011<ref name="pmid21419704">{{cite journal |author=Lewitt PA, Rezai AR, Leehey MA, ''et al.''|title=AAV2-GAD gene therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease: a double-blind, sham-surgery controlled, randomised trial |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=309–19|year=2011 |month=April |pmid=21419704 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(11)70039-4 }}</ref>, but the company filed for bankruptcy in March 2012<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-16/neurologix-files-to-liquidate-under-chapter-7-bankruptcy-1-.html |title=Neurologix Files to Liquidate Under Chapter 7 Bankruptcy }}</ref>.

=== Neuroprotective treatments ===
[[File:GDNF.jpg|thumb|Several chemical compounds such as [[GDNF]] (chemical structure pictured) have been proposed as neuroprotectors in PD, but their effectiveness has not been proven.]]
Investigations on [[neuroprotective|neuroprotection]] are at the forefront of PD research. Several molecules have been proposed as potential treatments.<ref name="pmid20495568"/> However, none of them have been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration.<ref name="pmid20495568"/> Agents currently under investigation include [[apoptosis|anti-apoptotic]]s ([[omigapil]], [[CEP-1347]]), [[glutamate|antiglutamatergic]]s, [[monoamine oxidase]] inhibitors ([[selegiline]], [[rasagiline]]), [[mitochondrial|promitochondrial]]s ([[coenzyme Q10]], [[creatine]]), [[calcium channel blocker]]s ([[isradipine]]) and [[growth factor]]s ([[GDNF]]).<ref name="pmid20495568"/> Preclinical research also targets [[alpha-synuclein]].<ref name=Dimond>{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/analysis-and-insight/no-new-parkinson-disease-drug-expected-anytime-soon/77899336/|title=No New Parkinson Disease Drug Expected Anytime Soon |author=Dimond PF|date=2010-08-16|work=GEN news highlights |publisher=GEN-Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News }}</ref> A [[vaccine]] that primes the human immune system to destroy [[alpha-synuclein]], PD01A (developed by Austrian company, Affiris), has entered clinical trials in humans.<ref name=NS1>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428682.000-worlds-first-parkinsons-vaccine-is-trialled.html |title=World's first Parkinson's vaccine is trialled |author= |date=2012-06-07 |work=|publisher=New Scientist }}</ref>

=== Neural transplantation ===
Since early in the 1980s, [[fetus|fetal]], [[pig|porcine]], [[Common carotid artery|carotid]] or [[retina]]l tissues have been used in cell transplants, in which dissociated cells are injected into the substantia nigra in the hope that they will incorporate themselves into the brain in a way that replaces the dopamine-producing cells that have been lost.<ref name="pmid20495568"/>
Although there was initial evidence of [[Mesencephalon|mesencephalic]] dopamine-producing cell transplants being beneficial, [[Double-blind#Double-blind trials|double-blind trials]] to date indicate that cell transplants produce no long-term benefit.<ref name="pmid20495568">{{cite journal |author=Obeso JA, Rodriguez-Oroz MC, Goetz CG, ''et al.'' |title=Missing pieces in the Parkinson's disease puzzle |journal=Nat.
