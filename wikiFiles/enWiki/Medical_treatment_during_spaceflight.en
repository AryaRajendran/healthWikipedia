It is inevitable that medical conditions of varying complexity, severity and emergency will occur during [[spaceflight]] missions with human participants.  Different levels of care are required depending on the problem, available resources and time required to return to Earth.  

All medical problems have the potential to affect the mission, but significant illnesses or trauma will result in a high probability of mission failure or loss of crew.  As the distance that missions travel from Earth increases, more possible medical conditions and types of trauma need to be evaluated.{{by whom?|date=February 2013}}  Return to Earth will be highly unlikely or very difficult depending on the distance traveled.{{citation needed (lead)|date=February 2013}}  
Emergency health care will, and psychological support may, have to be self-administered and could possibly be completely autonomous.  The most effective way to provide adequate support is to establish a thorough pre-flight health status assessment and develop a systematic approach to autonomous health care in space.<ref>{{cite web|last=Risin|first=Diana|title=Risk of Inability to Adequately Treat an Ill or Injured Crew Member|url=http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/evidence/reports/ExMC.pdf|work=Human Health and Performance Risks of Space Exploration Missions: Evidence reviewed by the NASA Human Research Program|accessdate=23 May 2012|page=241}}</ref>

===Non-Emergencies===
Most medical conditions that occur while in flight do not constitute a medical emergency and can be treated with medication, if available.  Some documented non-emergency conditions that have occurred while in space include<ref name="241-244">{{cite web|last=Risin|first=Diana|title=Risk of Inability to Adequately Treat an Ill or Injured Crew Member|url=http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/evidence/reports/ExMC.pdf|work=Human Health and Performance Risks of Space Exploration Missions: Evidence reviewed by the NASA Human Research Program|accessdate=23 May 2012|pages=241–244}}</ref> [[Space adaptation sickness|Space Adaptation Sickness]], [[motion sickness]], [[headache]], [[Insomnia|sleeplessness]], [[back pain]], [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], [[burn]]s, [[Cutaneous condition|dermatological conditions]], [[Human_musculoskeletal_system#Diseases_and_disorders|musculoskeletal conditions]], [[Respiratory disease|respiratory illness]] and [[genitourinary]] problems.

===Emergencies===
Potential medical emergencies during space flight<ref name=241-244 /> [[arrhythmia]]s, [[heart attack]], [[stroke]], [[embolism]], massive [[hemorrhage]], emergencies related to [[Renal stones|renal stone]] formation, [[infection]] and [[Thrombosis|thrombotic complications]].

To date, only arrhythmias, [[renal colic]] and infections have been documented during space flights.  The documented arrhythmias were mostly mild abnormalities, but potentially serious arrhythmias have been reported.<ref name=241-244 />

Krikalev, Expedition 11 commander representing Russia’s Federal Space Agency, participates in medical training at Johnson Space Center (JSC). Space Medicine Instructor Tyler N. Carruth with Wyle Life Sciences assisted Krikalev.]]

The manifestation of [[coronary artery disease]] has not been registered during any human space flight, but considering the risk of coronary events in older people and the increasing age of crew members, the possibility of complications during long-duration missions should not be ignored.<ref name=241-244 />  Other medical emergencies that have been observed in space include rarem but real cases of urological <ref name=Berry>{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=CA|title=Medical legacy of Apollo|journal=Aero Med|year=1974|volume=45|pages=1046–1057}}</ref><ref name=Lebedev>{{cite book|last=Lebedev|first=V.|title=Diary of a cosmonaut. 211 days in space|year=1983|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York}}</ref> and dental emergencies <ref name=Newkirk>{{cite book|last=Newkirk|first=D.|title=Almanac of Soviet manned space flight|year=1990|publisher=Gulf Publishing Company|location=Houston}}</ref><ref name=Brown>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=L.R.|coauthors=Frome, W.J.; Handler, S.; Wheatcroft, M.G.; Rider, L.J|title=Skylab oral health studies|journal=Biomedical results from Skylab|year=1977|url=http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/books/skylab/ch06.htm|publisher=NASA|location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>

Additional consideration substantiates the risk of the inability to treat crew members on long-duration missions.<ref name=241-244 />

===Radiation===
{{See also|Portal:Human Health and Performance in Space/Radiation Carcinogenesis}}
[[Ionizing radiation|Radiation]] exposure may affect the general health of crew members and cause radiation specific pathological processes.  Emergencies due to radiation exposure would most likely be catastrophic and mission ending.<ref name=241-244 />

===Other Risks===
Other considerations for designing space medical care systems<ref name=241-244 /> include exposure to [[Toxic_substance#Health_hazards|toxic substances]], [[chemical burns]], [[electrical burn]]s and [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] (on board and during [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA's]]).  Exposure to a range of hazards including chemical substances, microbes, radiation and noise can be prevented or controlled by the application of effective astronautical hygiene practice.

==On The Ground==
[[File:Ron Garan CMAS Experiment.jpg|thumb|right|NEEMO-9 astronaut/aquanaut Ronald J. Garan Jr. works with a Center for Minimal Access Surgery (CMAS) experiment in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Aquarius Underwater Laboratory, located off the coast of Key Largo, Florida, for the NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) project.]]
Ground based incidences of illness encountered by individuals exposed to harsh environments ([[Antarctic expedition]]s, submarines and [[undersea habitat]]s) could be considered as analogs of the space environment.  These crews living and working in harsh environments have had medical emergencies such as [[intracerebral hemorrhage]], [[stroke]], [[Myocardial infarction|myocardial infarction (heart attack)]], [[appendicitis]] and [[bone fractures]].  Cases of cancer and psychiatric illness were also documented.<ref name="244-246">{{cite web|last=Risin|first=Diana|title=Risk of Inability to Adequately Treat an Ill or Injured Crew Member|url=http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/evidence/reports/ExMC.pdf|work=Human Health and Performance Risks of Space Exploration Missions: Evidence reviewed by the NASA Human Research Program|accessdate=23 May 2012|pages=244–246}}</ref></br>

[[Portal:Dentistry|Dental]] problems were the most common emergency during submarine and Antarctic expeditions and were a cause for transfer in the [[UGM-27 Polaris|U.S. Polaris submarine program]].<ref name=244-246 /></br>

Risk estimates made from data provided by analog studies have certain limitations for long duration missions.  Unique problems that are inherent to the space environment include the effects of radiation, exposure and physiological adaptation to low gravity.  Cardiovascular events are of particular interest for long duration space missions and other harsh environments.  To use [[USAF|United States Air Force (USAF)]] aviators as an example, even though they undergo a very rigorous health screening, the first manifestation of [[Coronary artery disease|CAD (coronary artery disease)]] is a cardiac event.  Even though the health assessment for an astronaut is more extensive than USAF aviators, data collected from USAF aviators are applicable to the astronaut corps and emphasizes the risk of occurrence of sudden death or heart attack in space despite thorough screening.<ref name=244-246 /></br>

[[Appendicitis]] is the most common general surgical condition for the submarine program and has been the cause of one death on an Antarctic expedition.  Other serious conditions reported in the submarine program and Antarctic expeditions include [[traumatic amputation]]s, [[Bone fracture|fractures]], [[Joint dislocation|dislocations]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]].<ref name=244-246 /></br>

==Exploration Scenarios==
These documented conditions serve as a basis for the Exploration medical list.  This list is currently under development and will assist in planning research and development activities.  A medical support system is being developed to ensure that adequate medical care can be administered autonomously or with support from ground crews on Earth.

==Computer Based Simulators==
The [http://microgravity.grc.nasa.gov/SOPO/ICHO/HRP/ExMC/IMM/ Integrated Medical Model (IMM)], a computer based simulator that quantifies the probability and consequences of medical risks, is currently being developed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Risin|first=Diana|title=Risk of Inability to Adequately Treat an Ill or Injured Crew Member|url=http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/evidence/reports/ExMC.pdf|work=Human Health and Performance Risks of Space Exploration Missions: Evidence reviewed by the NASA Human Research Program|accessdate=23 May 2012|page=246}}</ref>
