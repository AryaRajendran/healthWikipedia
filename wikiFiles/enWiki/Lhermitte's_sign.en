'''Lhermitte's sign''', sometimes called '''the Barber Chair phenomenon''', is an electrical sensation that runs down the back and into the limbs. In many patients, it is elicited by bending the head forward.<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of Lhermitte sign|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=16049|work=medterms medical dictionary a-z list|publisher=MedicineNet.com|accessdate=20 April 2011}}</ref> It can also be evoked when a practitioner pounds on the posterior cervical spine while the neck is flexed; this is caused by  involvement of the posterior columns.

==Associated conditions==
The sign suggests a lesion of the dorsal columns of the cervical cord or of the caudal [[medulla oblongata|medulla]]. Although often considered a classic finding in [[multiple sclerosis]], it can be caused by a number of conditions, including [[transverse myelitis]],  [[Behçet's disease]],<ref>Page NG, Spiteri MA. Lhermitte's sign in Behçet's disease. ''Br Med J (Clin Res Ed)'' 1982 March 6; 284(6317): 704–705.</ref> trauma, radiation [[myelopathy]],<ref>Jones A. Transient radiation myelopathy (with reference to Lhermitte's sign of electrical paraesthesia). ''Br J Radiol'' 1964; 37:727-44.</ref> [[vitamin B12]] deficiency ([[Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord|subacute combined degeneration]]), and [[Spinal cord compression|compression of the spinal cord]] in the neck from any cause such as cervical [[spondylosis]], [[Spinal disc herniation|disc herniation]], tumor, and [[Arnold-Chiari malformation]]. Lhermitte's Sign may also appear during or following high dose [[chemotherapy]].<ref>Heinzlef et al. Severe neuropathy after high dose carboplatin in three patients receiving multidrug chemotherapy. "J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry" 1998; 64: 667-669.</ref> Irradiation of the [[cervical spine]] may also evoke it as an early delayed radiation injury, which occurs within 4 months of [[radiation therapy]].

This sign is also sometimes seen as part of a "[[SSRI discontinuation syndrome|discontinuation syndrome]]"  associated with certain psychotropic medications, such as [[serotonin reuptake inhibitors]], particularly [[Paroxetine]] and [[Venlafaxine]]. Typically, it only occurs after having taken the medication for some duration, and then stopped or withdrawn rapidly. [[Fluoxetine]], given its very long half-life, can be given as a single small dose, and often avoid Lhermitte's sign and other withdrawal symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Roy R. Reeves & Harold B. Pinkofsky |year=1996 |title=Lhermitte's sign in paroxetine withdrawal |journal=[[Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology]] |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=411–412 |pmid=8889917}}</ref>

In the dental field, three studies (Layzer 1978, Gutmann 1979, Blanco 1983) have identified Lhermitte's sign among [[nitrous oxide]] abusers. This is due to the fact that N<sub>2</sub>O depletes B<sub>12</sub>, leading to severe deficiency in the absence of supplementation.

==Terminology==
The Barber Chair phenomenon is a [[symptom]] rather than a [[medical sign|sign]] as it describes a subjective sensation rather than an objective finding. To add more confusion, it is not attributed to its discoverer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=José A. Gutrecht |year=1989 |title=Lhermitte's sign: from observation to eponym |journal=[[Archives of Neurology]] |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=557–558 |pmid=2653292}}</ref> It was first described by [[Pierre Marie]] and Chatelin in 1917.<ref>Marie P, Chatelin C. Sur certains symptômes vraisemblablement d'origine radiculaire chez les blessés du crâne. ''Rev Neurol'' 1917; 31:336.</ref> [[Jean Lhermitte]], a French neurologist and neuropsychiatrist, did not publish his first report until 1920.<ref>Lhermitte JJ. Les formes douloureuses de la commotion de la moelle épinière. ''Rev Neurol'' 1920; 36:257-262.</ref> However, in 1924 he did publish the seminal article on the subject which resulted in it becoming well known.<ref>Lhermitte JJ, Bollak NM. Les douleurs à type décharge électrique consécutives à la flexion céphalique dans la sclérose en plaques. Un cas de la sclérose multiple. ''Revue neurologique'' 1924; 2:56-57.</ref> 

Given that Lhermitte's sign is named for '''Lhermitte''', it is incorrect to spell the term as "L'hermitte's sign".
