'''Herbicides''', also commonly known as '''weedkillers''', are [[pesticide]]s used to kill unwanted [[plant]]s.<ref name="Kelloggrl"/> Selective herbicides kill specific targets, while leaving the desired [[crop]] relatively unharmed. Some of these act by interfering with the growth of the [[weed]] and are often synthetic "imitations" of plant [[hormones]]. Herbicides used to clear waste ground, industrial sites, railways and railway embankments are not selective and kill all [[plant]] material with which they come into contact. Smaller quantities are used in forestry, pasture systems, and management of areas set aside as wildlife [[habitat]].

Some plants produce natural herbicides, such as the genus ''[[Juglans]]'' ([[walnut]]s), or the [[tree of heaven]]; such action of natural herbicides, and other related chemical interactions, is called [[allelopathy]].

Herbicides are widely used in [[agriculture]] and landscape turf management. In the US, they account for about 70% of all agricultural pesticide use.<ref name="Kelloggrl">{{cite web | author = Kellogg RL, Nehring R, Grube A, Goss DW, and Plotkin S | date = February 2000 | url = http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/NRI/pubs/eip_pap.html | title = Environmental indicators of pesticide leaching and runoff from farm fields | publisher = United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service | accessdate = 2010-08-26}}</ref>

==History==

Prior to the widespread use of chemical herbicides, [[cultural controls]], such as altering soil pH, salinity, or fertility levels, were used to control weeds. Mechanical control (including tillage) was also (and still is) used to control weeds.

Herbicides were first researched and discovered in both the UK and the US in the context of clandestine wartime efforts to create chemical warfare agents in 1941. The first herbicide, [[2,4-D]], was co-discovered independently by two teams; one at [[ICI]] and one at [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]]. The new chemicals ability to kill weeds was entirely incidental to the aim of the research in either country. Because research into chemical warfare was illegal under the [[Geneva Protocol]]s, the research operated under the plausible cover story of agricultural research.
Experimentation had become quite common (in the fashion of British team at [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]], under the leadership of [[Judah Hirsch Quastel]]. Some discoveries were able to be eventually used to increase crop yields, although 2-4D was not used until 1946 near the end of the WWII.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ba-1950-0001.ch045|chapter=2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid (2,4-D) as a Selective Herbicide|title=Agricultural Control Chemicals|series=Advances in Chemistry|year=1950|last1=Quastel|first1=J. H.|isbn=0-8412-2442-0|volume=1|pages=244}}</ref> When it was commercially released in 1946, it became the first successful selective herbicide and allowed for greatly enhanced weed control in [[wheat]], [[maize]] (corn), [[rice]], and similar [[cereal]] grass crops, because it kills [[dicots]] (broadleaf plants), but  not most [[monocots]] (grasses). The low cost of 2,4-D has led to continued usage today, and it remains one of the most commonly used herbicides in the world. Like other acid herbicides, current formulations use either an amine salt (often [[trimethylamine]]) or one of many [[ester]]s of the parent compound. These are easier to handle than the acid.

The triazine family of herbicides, which includes [[atrazine]], were introduced in the 1950s; they have the current distinction of being the herbicide family of greatest concern regarding groundwater contamination. Atrazine does not break down readily (within a few weeks) after being applied to soils of above neutral [[pH]]. Under alkaline soil conditions, atrazine may be carried into the soil profile as far as the water table by soil water following rainfall causing the aforementioned contamination. Atrazine is thus said to have "carryover", a generally undesirable property for herbicides.

[[Glyphosate]], frequently sold under the brand name [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]], was introduced in 1974 for nonselective weed control. It is now a major herbicide in selective weed control in growing crop plants due to the development of resistant crop plants. The pairing of the herbicide with the resistant seed contributed to the consolidation of the seed and chemistry industry in the late 1990s.

Many modern chemical herbicides for agriculture are specifically formulated to decompose within a short period after application. This is desirable, as it allows crops which may be affected by the herbicide to be grown on the land in future seasons. However, herbicides with low residual activity (i.e., that decompose quickly) often do not provide season-long weed control.

==Health and environmental effects==
{{See also|Environmental effects of pesticides|Health effects of pesticides}}
Herbicides have widely variable [[toxicity]]. In addition to [[acute toxicity]] from high exposure levels, there is concern of possible [[carcinogenicity]],<ref name="jnci">{{cite journal | url = http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/84/24/1866 | author = Howard I.

Some herbicides cause a range of health effects ranging from skin rashes to death. The pathway of attack can arise from intentional or unintentional direct consumption, improper application resulting in the herbicide coming into direct contact with people or wildlife, inhalation of aerial sprays, or food consumption prior to the labeled preharvest interval. Under extreme conditions, herbicides can also be transported via [[surface runoff]] to contaminate distant water sources. Most herbicides decompose rapidly in soils via soil microbial decomposition, hydrolysis, or photolysis.

[[Phenoxy herbicides]] are often contaminated with [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] such as [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|TCDD]]; research has suggested such contamination results in a small rise in cancer risk after exposure to these herbicides.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 9199536 | year = 1997 | last1 = Kogevinas | first1 = M | last2 = Becher | first2 = H | last3 = Benn | first3 = T | last4 = Bertazzi | first4 = PA | last5 = Boffetta | first5 = P | last6 = Bueno-De-Mesquita | first6 = HB | last7 = Coggon | first7 = D | last8 = Colin | first8 = D | last9 = Flesch-Janys | first9 = D | title = Cancer mortality in workers exposed to phenoxy herbicides, chlorophenols, and dioxins.

Herbicide manufacturers have at times made false or misleading claims about the safety of their products. Chemical manufacturer [[Monsanto Company]] agreed to change its advertising after pressure from [[New York]] [[attorney general]] [[Dennis Vacco]]; Vacco complained about misleading claims that its spray-on glyphosate-based herbicides, including Roundup, were safer than table salt and "practically non-toxic" to mammals, birds, and fish.<ref>{{cite news | title = Monsanto Pulls Roundup Advertising in New York | publisher = Wichita Eagle | date = Nov. 27, 1996}}</ref> Roundup is toxic and has resulted in [[death]] after being ingested in quantities ranging from 85 to 200 ml, although it has also been ingested in quantities as large as 500 ml with only mild or moderate symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 1673618 | year = 1991 | last1 = Talbot | first1 = AR | last2 = Shiaw | first2 = MH | last3 = Huang | first3 = JS | last4 = Yang | first4 = SF | last5 = Goo | first5 = TS | last6 = Wang | first6 = SH | last7 = Chen | first7 = CL | last8 = Sanford | first8 = TR | title = Acute poisoning with a glyphosate-surfactant herbicide ('Roundup'): A review of 93 cases | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | journal = Human & experimental toxicology | doi = 10.1177/096032719101000101}}</ref> The manufacturer of [[Tordon 101]] ([[Dow AgroSciences]], owned by the [[Dow Chemical Company]]) has claimed Tordon 101 has no effects on animals and insects,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/nova-scotia/story/2009/06/16/novascotia-eastern-shore-nsp.html | title = Complaints halt herbicide spraying in Eastern Shore | publisher = CBC News | date = June 16, 2009}}</ref> in spite of evidence of strong carcinogenic activity of the active ingredient<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20100312025508/http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/notes/picloram2.htm "Tordon 101: picloram/2,4-D"], Ontario Ministry of Agriculture Food & Rural Affairs</ref> [[Picloram]] in studies on rats.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=ENV&recid=227419&q=Picloram+cancer&uid=787347064&setcookie=yes | author = Reuber, MD | title = Carcinogenicity of Picloram | journal = Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 207–222 | year = 1981 | doi = 10.1080/15287398109529973 | pmid = 7014921}}</ref>

All commercially sold, organic and nonorganic herbicides must be extensively tested prior to approval for sale and labeling by the Environmental Protection Agency. However, because of the large number of herbicides in use, concern regarding health effects is significant. In addition to health effects caused by herbicides themselves, commercial herbicide mixtures often contain other chemicals, including [[inactive ingredients]], which have negative impacts on human health. For example, Roundup contains [[adjuvants]] which, even in low concentrations, were found to kill human embryonic, placental, and umbilical cells ''[[in vitro]]''.<ref name="human cells">{{cite journal|last=Benachour|first=Nora |coauthors=Gilles-Eric Séralini|date=December 23, 2008|title=Glyphosate Formulations Induce Apoptosis and Necrosis in Human Umbilical, Embryonic, and Placental Cells|journal=[[Chemical Research in Toxicology]]|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/tx800218n|doi=10.1021/tx800218n|pmid=19105591|volume=22|issue=1|pages=97–105}}</ref> One study also found Roundup caused genetic damage, but the damage was not caused by the active ingredient.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 9464316 | year = 1998 | last1 = Peluso | first1 = M | last2 = Munnia | first2 = A | last3 = Bolognesi | first3 = C | last4 = Parodi | first4 = S | title = 32P-postlabeling detection of DNA adducts in mice treated with the herbicide Roundup | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–9 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2280(1998)31:1<55::AID-EM8>3.0.CO;2-A | journal = Environmental and molecular mutagenesis}}</ref>

===Ecological effects===
Commercial herbicide use generally has negative impacts on [[bird]] [[populations]], although the impacts are highly variable and often require [[field study|field studies]] to predict accurately. Laboratory studies have at times overestimated negative impacts on birds due to toxicity, predicting serious problems that were not observed in the field.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1890/1051-0761(1997)007[1125:FSOPAB]2.0.CO;2 | year = 1997 | volume = 7 | page = 1125 | title = Field Studies on Pesticides and Birds: Unexpected and Unique Relations | last1 = Blus | first1 = Lawrence J. | last2 = Henny | first2 = Charles J. | journal = Ecological Applications | issue = 4}}</ref> Most observed effects are due not to toxicity, but to habitat changes and the decreases in abundance of species on which birds rely for food or shelter. Herbicide use in [[silviculture]], used to favor certain types of growth following [[clearcutting]], can cause significant drops in bird populations. Even when herbicides which have low toxicity to birds are used, they decrease the abundance of many types of vegetation on which the birds rely.<ref>{{cite journal | author = MacKinnon, D.

===Scientific uncertainty===
The health and environmental effects of many herbicides is unknown, and even the scientific community often disagrees on the risk. For example, a 1995 panel of 13 scientists reviewing studies on the carcinogenicity of [[2,4-D]] had divided opinions on the likelihood 2,4-D causes cancer in humans.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ibrahim MA, Bond GG, Burke TA, Cole P, Dost FN, Enterline PE, Gough M, Greenberg RS, Halperin WE, McConnell E, et al.| title = Weight of the evidence on the human carcinogenicity of 2,4-D | journal = Environ Health Perspect | year = 1991 | volume = 96 | pages = 213–222 | pmid = 1820267 | pmc = 1568222}}</ref> {{As of|1992}}, studies on [[phenoxy herbicides]] were too few to accurately assess the risk of many types of cancer from these herbicides, even though evidence was stronger that exposure to these herbicides is associated with increased risk of [[soft tissue sarcoma]] and [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]].<ref name="jnci" />  Furthermore, there is some suggestion that herbicides{{which|date=December 2012}} can play a role in [[sex reversal]] of certain organisms that experience [[temperature-dependent sex determination]], which could theoretically alter sex ratios.<ref>{{cite book |title=Developmental Biology |last=Gilbert |first=Scott F |edition=9th |publisher=Sinauer Associates |year=2010 |page={{page needed|date=January 2013}} |isbn=978-0-87893-384-6}}</ref>

==Resistance==
Scientists generally agree [[selection pressure]] applied to weed populations for a long enough period of time eventually leads to resistance. Plants have developed resistance to [[atrazine]] and to ALS-inhibitors, and more recently, to [[glyphosate]] herbicides. [[Conyza canadensis|Marestail]] is one weed that has developed glyphosate resistance.<ref>Marking, Syl (January 1, 2002) [http://cornandsoybeandigest.com/mag/soybean_marestail_jumps_glyphosate/ "Marestail Jumps Glyphosate Fence"], Corn and Soybean Digest.</ref>

==Classification==
Herbicides can be grouped by activity, use, chemical family, mode of action, or type of vegetation controlled.

By activity:
* '''Contact''' herbicides destroy only the plant tissue in contact with the chemical. Generally, these are the fastest acting herbicides. They are less effective on perennial plants, which are able to regrow from rhizomes, roots or tubers.
* '''Systemic''' herbicides are translocated through the plant, either from foliar application down to the roots, or from soil application up to the leaves. They are capable of controlling perennial plants and may be slower-acting, but ultimately more effective than contact herbicides.

By use:
* '''Soil-applied''' herbicides are applied to the soil and are taken up by the roots and/or hypocotyl of the target plant. The three main types are:
# '''Preplant incorporated''' herbicides are soil applied prior to planting and mechanically incorporated into the soil. The objective for incorporation is to prevent dissipation through [[Photodissociation|photodecomposition]] and/or volatility.
# '''[[Pre-emergent herbicides]]''' are applied to the soil before the crop emerges and prevent germination or early growth of weed seeds.
# '''Postemergent herbicides''' are applied after the crop has emerged.

Their classification by [[mechanism of action]] (MOA) indicates the first enzyme, protein, or biochemical step affected in the plant following application. The main mechanisms of action are:
* '''ACCase inhibitors''' compounds kill grasses. Acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) is part of the first step of lipid synthesis. Thus, ACCase inhibitors affect cell membrane production in the [[meristems]] of the grass plant. The ACCases of grasses are sensitive to these herbicides, whereas the ACCases of [[dicot]] plants are not.
* ''' ALS inhibitors''': the [[acetolactate synthase]] (ALS) enzyme (also known as acetohydroxyacid synthase, or AHAS) is the first step in the synthesis of the branched-chain amino acids ([[valine]], [[leucine]], and [[isoleucine]]). These herbicides slowly starve affected plants of these [[amino acid]]s, which eventually leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis. They affect grasses and dicots alike. The ALS inhibitor family includes [[sulfonylurea]]s, imidazolinones, triazolopyrimidines, pyrimidinyl oxybenzoates, and sulfonylamino carbonyl triazolinones. The ALS biological pathway exists only in plants and not animals, thus making the ALS-inhibitors among the safest herbicides.
* '''EPSPS inhibitors''': The enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase enzyme EPSPS is used in the synthesis of the amino acids [[tryptophan]], [[phenylalanine]] and [[tyrosine]]. They affect grasses and dicots alike. [[Glyphosate]] (Roundup) is a systemic EPSPS inhibitor inactivated by soil contact.
* '''Synthetic auxins''' inaugurated the era of organic herbicides. They were discovered in the 1940s after a long study of the plant growth regulator [[auxin]]. Synthetic auxins mimic this plant hormone. They have several points of action on the cell membrane, and are effective in the control of dicot plants. 2,4-D is a synthetic auxin herbicide.
* '''Photosystem II inhibitors''' reduce electron flow from water to NADPH2+ at the photochemical step in photosynthesis. They bind to the Qb site on the D1 protein, and prevent quinone from binding to this site. Therefore, this group of compounds causes electrons to accumulate on [[chlorophyll]] molecules. As a consequence, [[oxidation]] reactions in excess of those normally tolerated by the cell occur, and the plant dies. The triazine herbicides (including atrazine) and urea derivatives (diuron) are photosystem II inhibitors.<ref name="stryer">{{cite book |last = Stryer |first = Lubert |title = Biochemistry, 4th Edition |publisher = W.H. Freeman and Company |year = 1995 |page = 670 |isbn = 0-7167-2009-4}}</ref>
* '''Photosystem I inhibitors''' steal electrons from the normal pathway through FeS – Fdx – NADP leading to direct discharge of electrons on oxygen. As a result, reactive oxygen species are produced and [[oxidation]] reactions in excess of those normally tolerated by the cell occur, leading to plant death.

Bipyridinium herbicides (such as [[diquat]] and [[paraquat]]) hit the "Fe-S – Fdx step" while diphenyl ether herbicide (such as [[nitrofen]], [[nitrofluorfen]], and [[acifluorfen]]) hit the "Fdx – NADP step".{{clarify|date=January 2012}}<ref name="stryer"/>

==Organic herbicides==
Recently, the term "organic" has come to imply products used in [[organic farming]]. Under this definition, an organic herbicide is one that can be used in a farming enterprise that has been classified as organic. Commercially sold organic herbicides are expensive and may not be affordable for commercial farming.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Depending on the application, they may be less effective than synthetic herbicides and are generally used along with cultural and mechanical weed control practices.

Homemade organic herbicides include:
* Corn gluten meal (CGM) is a natural pre-emergence weed control used in turfgrass, which reduces germination of many broadleaf and grass weeds.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0889189300008778|title=Corn gluten meal—a natural preemergence herbicide: Effect on vegetable seedling survival and weed cover|year=2009|last1=McDade|first1=Melissa C.|last2=Christians|first2=Nick E.|journal=American Journal of Alternative Agriculture|volume=15|issue=4|pages=189 }}</ref>
* [[Spice]]s are now effectively used in herbicides.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* [[Vinegar]]<ref>[http://ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2002/020515.htm Spray Weeds With Vinegar?]. Ars.usda.gov.

Resistant plants generally succumb when weakened by respraying.
* [[Steam]] has been applied commercially, but is now considered uneconomical and inadequate.<ref>[http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7441.html Weed Management in Landscapes].

* D-[[limonene]] ([[citrus]] oil) is a natural degreasing agent that strips the waxy skin or cuticle from weeds, causing dehydration and ultimately death.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* Saltwater or salt applied in appropriate strengths to the rootzone will kill most plants.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* [[Monocerin]] produced by certain fungi will kill certain weeds such as [[Johnson grass]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Application==
Most herbicides are applied as water-based sprays using ground equipment. Ground equipment varies in design, but large areas can be sprayed using self-propelled [[sprayer]]s equipped with long booms, of {{Convert|60|to|80|ft|m|0}} with flat-fan nozzles spaced about every {{Convert|20|in|mm}}. Towed, handheld, and even horse-drawn sprayers are also used.

Synthetic organic herbicides can generally be applied aerially using helicopters or airplanes, and can be applied through irrigation systems ([[chemigation]]).

A new method of herbicide application involves ridding the soil of its active weed seed bank rather than just killing the weed. Researchers at the [[Agricultural Research Service]] have found the application of herbicides to fields late in the weeds' growing season greatly reduces their seed production, and therefore fewer weeds will return the following season.  Because most weeds are annual grasses, their seeds will only survive in soil for a year or two, so this method will be able to “weed out” the weed with only a few years of herbicide application.<ref>{{cite web

|date=May 5, 2010}}</ref>

[[Weed-wiping]] may also be used, where a wick wetted with herbicide is suspended from a boom and dragged or rolled across the tops of the taller weed plants. This allows treatment of taller grassland weeds by direct contact without affecting related but desirable plants in the grassland sward beneath.

===Misapplication===
[[Herbicide volatilisation]] or drift may result in herbicide affecting neighboring fields or plants, particularly in windy conditions. Sometimes, the wrong field or plants may be sprayed due to error.

==Terminology==
* '''Control''' is the destruction of unwanted weeds, or the damage of them to the point where they are no longer competitive with the crop.
* '''Suppression''' is incomplete control still providing some economic benefit, such as reduced competition with the crop.
* '''Crop safety''', for selective herbicides, is the relative absence of damage or stress to the crop. Most selective herbicides cause some visible stress to crop plants.

Sold under trade names Raptor, Beyond, and Clearcast.<ref>[http://pnwhandbooks.org/weed/agrichemicals/imazamox IMAZAMOX | Pacific Northwest Weed Management Handbook]. Pnwhandbooks.org.

* [[Linuron]] is a nonselective herbicide used in the control of grasses and broadleaf weeds. It works by inhibiting photosynthesis.
* [[Metolachlor]] is a pre-emergent herbicide widely used for control of annual grasses in corn and sorghum; it has displaced some of the [[atrazine]] in these uses.
* [[Paraquat]] is a nonselective contact herbicide used for no-till burndown and in aerial destruction of marijuana and coca plantings. It is more acutely toxic to people than any other herbicide in widespread commercial use.
* [[Pendimethalin]], a pre-emergent herbicide, is widely used to control annual grasses and some broad-leaf weeds in a wide range of crops, including corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, many tree and vine crops, and many turfgrass species.
* [[Picloram]], a pyridine herbicide, mainly is used to control unwanted trees in pastures and edges of fields. It is another synthetic auxin.
* [[Sodium chlorate]], a nonselective herbicide, is considered phytotoxic to all green plant parts. It can also kill through root absorption.
* [[Triclopyr]], a systemic, foliar herbicide in the pyridine group, is used to control broadleaf weeds while leaving grasses and conifers unaffected.

==Historical interest: 2,4,5-T==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
* [[2,4,5-T|2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T) was a widely used broadleaf herbicide until being phased out starting in the late 1970s. While 2,4,5-T itself is of only moderate toxicity, the manufacturing process for 2,4,5-T contaminates this chemical with trace amounts of [[2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin]] (TCDD). TCDD is extremely toxic to humans. With proper temperature control during production of 2,4,5-T, TCDD levels can be held to about .005 ppm. Before the TCDD risk was well understood, early production facilities lacked proper temperature controls. Individual batches tested later were found to have as much as 60 ppm of TCDD.
* 2,4,5-T was withdrawn from use in the USA in 1983, at a time of heightened public sensitivity about chemical hazards in the environment. Public concern about [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]] was high, and production and use of other (non-herbicide) chemicals potentially containing TCDD contamination was also withdrawn. These included [[pentachlorophenol]] (a wood preservative) and [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] (mainly used as stabilizing agents in transformer oil). Some feel {{Who|date=July 2010}} that the 2,4,5-T withdrawal was not based on sound science. 2,4,5-T has since largely been replaced by [[dicamba]] and [[triclopyr]].
* [[Agent Orange]] was an herbicide blend used by the U.S. military in Vietnam between January 1965 and April 1970 as a defoliant. It was a 50/50 mixture of the ''n''-butyl esters of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D. Because of TCDD contamination in the 2,4,5-T component, {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} it has been blamed for serious illnesses in many veterans and Vietnamese people who were exposed to it. However, research on populations exposed to its dioxin contaminant have been inconsistent and inconclusive {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}. Agent Orange often had much higher levels of TCDD than 2,4,5-T used in the US {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}. The name ''Agent Orange'' is derived from the orange color-coded stripe used by the Army on barrels containing the product. It is worth noting {{opinion|date=December 2011}} that there were other blends of synthetic auxins at the time of the [[Vietnam War]] whose containers were recognized by their colors, such as [[Agent Purple]] and [[Agent Pink]] {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.
