'''Medulloblastoma''' is a highly [[malignant]] primary [[brain tumor]] that originates in the [[cerebellum]] or [[posterior cranial fossa|posterior fossa]].

[[Tumor]]s that originate in the [[cerebellum]] are referred to as [[infratentorial neoplasms|infratentorial]] because they occur below the [[tentorium cerebelli|tentorium]], a thick membrane that separates the [[cerebral hemisphere]]s of the brain from the cerebellum.  Another term for '''medulloblastoma''' is infratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET).  Medulloblastoma is the most common PNET originating in the brain.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hinz, Chris; Hesser, Deneen |title=Focusing On Brain Tumors: Medulloblastoma |publisher=American Brain Tumor Association |isbn=0-944093-67-1 |url=http://hope.abta.org/mdl}}</ref>

All [[Primitive neuroectodermal tumor|PNET]] tumors of the brain are invasive and rapidly growing tumors that, unlike most brain tumors, spread through the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) and frequently [[Metastasis|metastasize]] to different locations in the brain and spine.

==Incidence==

==Pathogenesis==
Medulloblastomas usually form in the vicinity of the fourth ventricle, between the brainstem and the cerebellum.  Tumors with similar appearance and characteristics originate in other parts of the brain, but they are not identical to medulloblastoma.<ref>Roger Packer M.D, [http://virtualtrials.com/medullo.cfm Medulloblastoma] Clinical Trials and Noteworthy Treatments for Brain Tumors 2002.</ref>

Although it is thought that medulloblastomas originate from immature or embryonal cells at their earliest stage of development, the exact cell of origin, or "medulloblast" has yet to be identified.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}
  
It is currently thought that medulloblastoma arises from cerebellar stem cells that have been prevented from dividing and differentiating into their normal cell types. This accounts from the varying histologic variants seen on biopsy. Both perivascular pseudorosette and Homer-Wright rosette pseudorosettes formation are highly characteristic of medulloblastoma and is seen in up to half of the cases. Homer-Wright rosettes are pseudorosettes consisting of tumor cells surrounding a fibrillar area.<ref>{{cite book |author=White, Lucile E.; Levy, Ross M.; Alam, Murad |chapter=Ch. 127.

Recent integrated genomic studies have revealed that medulloblastoma is composed of four distinct molecular and clinical variants termed WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Michael D.|title=Molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma: the current consensus.|journal=Acta Neuropathologica|date=Feb. 2012|doi=10.1007/s00401-011-0922-z|pmid=22134537|volume=123|issue=4|pmc=3306779|pages=465–72}}</ref>  Of these subgroups WNT patients have an excellent prognosis and Group 3 have a dismal prognosis.  There also exists subgroup specific alternative splicing which further confirms the existence of distinct subgroups and highlights the transcriptional heterogeneity between subgroups.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dubuc|first=Adrian M.|title=Subgroup-specific alternative splicing in medulloblastoma.|journal=Acta Neuropathologica|date=Feb. 2012|doi=10.1007/s00401-012-0959-7}}</ref>  Medulloblastomas are also seen in [[Gorlin syndrome]] as well as [[Turcot syndrome]]. Recurrent mutations in the genes [[CTNNB1]], [[PTCH1]], [[MLL2]], [[SMARCA4]], [[DDX3X]], [[CTDNEP1]], [[KDM6A]] and [[TBR1]] were identified in individuals with medulloblastoma.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=David T. W.|coauthors=Jäger, Natalie; Kool, Marcel; ''et al.''|title=Dissecting the genomic complexity underlying medulloblastoma|journal=Nature|date=Jul. 2012|doi=10.1038/nature11284|volume=488|issue=7409}}</ref>

==Clinical manifestation==
Symptoms are mainly due to secondary increased [[intracranial pressure]] due to blockage of the [[fourth ventricle]] and are usually present for 1 to 5 months before diagnosis is made. The child typically becomes listless, with repeated episodes of vomiting, and a morning headache, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of gastrointestinal disease or migraine. Soon after, the child will develop a stumbling gait, frequent falls, [[diplopia]], [[papilledema]], and sixth cranial nerve palsy. Positional dizziness and [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] are also frequent and facial sensory loss or motor weakness may be present. [[Decerebrate]] attacks appear late in the disease. 

Extraneural metastasis to the rest of the body is rare, and generally occurs only after [[craniotomy]].

==Diagnosis==
The tumor is distinctive on T1 and T2-weighted [[MRI]] with heterogeneous enhancement and typical location adjacent to and extension into the fourth ventricle. 

Histologically, the tumor is solid, pink-gray in color, and is well circumscribed. The tumor is very cellular, many mitoses, little cytoplasm, and has the tendency to form clusters and rosettes.

Correct diagnosis of medulloblastoma may require ruling out [[ATRT|atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor]] (ATRT)<ref>{{cite journal

== Treatment and prognosis==
Treatment begins with maximal [[Segmental resection|resection]] of the tumor. The addition of radiation to the entire neuraxis and [[chemotherapy]] may increase the disease-free survival. There is some evidence that Proton beam irradiation provides some benefits in terms of reducing the impact of radiation on the cochlear and cardiovascular areas  and that it reduced the cognitive late effects of cranial irradiation.<ref> http://Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Jul;51(1):110-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21530.

www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18306274 </ref>  <ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22611031</ref> 
This combination may permit a 5 year survival in more than 80% of cases. The presence of desmoplastic features such as connective tissue formation offers a better prognosis. Prognosis is worse if the child is less than 3 years old, there is an inadequate degree of resection, or if there is any CSF, spinal, supratentorial or systemic spread. Dementia post radiotherapy and chemotherapy is a common outcome appearing two to four years following treatment.

Increased intracranial pressure may be controlled with [[corticosteroids]] or a ventriculoperitoneal [[shunt (medical)|shunt]].

===Chemotherapy===
Chemotherapy is now an important part of treatment for all patients with medulloblastoma. It can significantly reduce risk of recurrence (which is typically fatal). There are a couple of different chemotheraputic regimens for medulloblastoma, but most involve a combination of [[lomustine]], [[cisplatin]], [[carboplatin]], [[vincristine]] or [[cyclophosphamide]]. In younger patients (less than 3–4 years of age), chemotherapy can delay, or in some cases possibly even eliminate, the need for radiotherapy.<ref>www.ABTA.org</ref>

Currently an NCI supported Phase I clinical trial involving the Curis/Genentech compound [[vismodegib]] (GDC-0449) is being evaluated in pediatric medulloblastoma patients, and has been tested in some PNET patients as well. This compound targets a cellular signalling pathway of the cancer cells, which controls how they divide and grow.

===Outcome Prediction Based on Genomics===
[[Virtual Karyotype|Array-based karyotyping]] of 260 medulloblastomas by Pfister S, ''et al.'' resulted in the following clinical subgroups based on cytogenetic profiles:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pfister S, Remke M, Benner A, ''et al.'' |title=Outcome prediction in pediatric medulloblastoma based on DNA copy-number aberrations of chromosomes 6q and 17q and the MYC and MYCN loci |journal=J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=1627–36 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19255330 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2008.17.9432 |url=http://www.jco.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19255330}}</ref>
*Poor prognosis: gain of [[Chromosome 6 (human)|6q]] or amplification of MYC or [[MYCN]]
*Intermediate: gain of 17q or an i(17q) without gain of 6q or amplfication of MYC or MYCN
*Excellent prognosis: 6q and 17q balanced or 6q deletion

Transcriptional profiling show the existence of four main subgroups (Wnt, Shh, Group 3, and Group 4).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=MD|coauthors=Northcott, PA; Korshunov, A; Remke, M; Cho, YJ; Clifford, SC; Eberhart, CG; Parsons, DW; Rutkowski, S; Gajjar, A; Ellison, DW; Lichter, P; Gilbertson, RJ; Pomeroy, SL; Kool, M; Pfister, SM|title=Molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma: the current consensus.|journal=Acta Neuropathologica|date=2012 Apr|year=2012|month=April|volume=123|issue=4|pages=465–72|pmid=22134537|accessdate=8 August 2012|pmc=3306778|doi=10.1007/s00401-011-0922-z}}</ref> 
*Very good prognosis: WNT group, CTNNB1 mutation
*Infants good prognosis, others intermediate: SHH group, PTCH1/SMO/SUFU mutation, GLI2 amplification, or MYCN amplification
*Poor prognosis: Group 3, MYC amplification, photoreceptor/GABAergic gene expression
*Intermediate prognosis: Group 4, gene expression of neuronal/glutamatergic, CDK6 amplification, MYCN amplification

===Survival===
Patients diagnosed with a medulloblastoma or PNET are 50 times more likely to die than a matched member of the general population.
The most recent population-based (SEER) [[Five-year survival rate|5-year relative survival rates]] are 69% overall, but 72% in children (1–9 years) and 67% in adults (20+ years). The 20 year survival rate is 51% in children. Children and adults have different survival profiles, with adults faring worse than children only after the 4th year post-diagnosis (after controlling for increased background mortality). Before the 4th year, survival probabilities are nearly identical.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Smoll NR |title=Relative survival of childhood and adult medulloblastomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) |journal=Cancer |volume=118 |issue=5 |pages=1313–22 |year=2012 |month=March |pmid=21837678 |doi=10.1002/cncr.26387 |url=}}</ref> Longterm sequelae  of standard treatment include hypothalamic-pituitary and thyroid dysfunction and intellectual impairment.

==Model==
Using gene transfer of SV40 large T-antigen in neuronal precursor cells of rats, a brain tumor model was established. The PNETs were histologically indistinguishable from the human counterparts and have been used to identify new genes involved in human brain tumor carcinogenesis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eibl RH, Kleihues P, Jat PS, Wiestler OD |title=A model for primitive neuroectodermal tumors in transgenic neural transplants harboring the SV40 large T antigen |journal=Am.
