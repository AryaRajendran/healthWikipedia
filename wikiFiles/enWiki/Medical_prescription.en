A '''prescription''' ({{Unicode|℞}}) is a health-care programme that governs the plan of care for an individual patient and is implemented by a qualified practitioner.<ref>Belknap 2008</ref> A qualified practitioner might be a [[physician]], [[dentist]], [[nurse practitioner]], [[pharmacist]], [[psychologist]], or other health care providers.  Prescriptions may include orders to be performed by a [[patient]], [[caregiver|caretaker]], [[nurse]], [[pharmacist]], [[physician]], other [[therapist]], or by automated equipment, such as an intravenous infusion pump. Formerly, ''prescriptions'' often included detailed instructions regarding compounding of medications but as medications have increasingly become pre-packaged manufactured products, the term "prescription" now usually refers to an order that a pharmacist dispense and that a patient take certain [[medication]]s. Prescriptions have legal implications, as they may indicate that the prescriber takes responsibility for the clinical care of the patient and in particular for monitoring efficacy and [[safety]]. As medical practice has become increasingly complex, the scope of meaning of the term "prescription" has broadened to also include clinical assessments, laboratory tests, and imaging studies relevant to optimizing the safety or efficacy of medical treatment.

==Format and definition==
[[File:Rx symbol border.svg|160px|thumb|right|Prescription symbol {{unichar|211e|prescription take|html=}}]]
Prescriptions are typically [[handwritten]] on preprinted prescription forms that are assembled into pads, or alternatively printed onto similar forms using a [[computer printer]] or are in an electronic format.  Preprinted on the form is text that identifies the document as a prescription, the name and address of the prescribing provider and any other legal requirement such as a registration number (e.g. [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] Number in the [[United States]]).  Unique for each prescription is the name of the patient.  In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], the patient's name and address must also be recorded. Each prescription is dated and some [[jurisdiction]]s may place a time limit on the prescription.<ref>[http://www.med.rug.nl/pharma/who-cc/ggp/chapter9/page01.htm]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}</ref> There is the specific "recipe" of the medication and the directions for taking it.

''{{Unicode|℞}}'' is a symbol meaning "prescription". It is sometimes [[transliteration|transliterated]] as "R<sub>x</sub>" or just "Rx". This symbol originated in medieval manuscripts as an abbreviation of the Late Latin verb ''recipe'', the imperative form of ''recipere'', "to take" or "take thus".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=recipe |title=Recipe definition|publisher=M-w.com |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2010-01-22}}</ref> Literally, the Latin word ''recipe'' means simply "Take...." and medieval prescriptions invariably began with the command to "take" certain materials and compound them in specified ways.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, articles on the letter "R" (sense 14b) and the word "recipe."</ref> Today, when a medical practitioner writes a prescription beginning with "{{Unicode|℞}}", he or she is completing the command.

Folk theories about the origin of the symbol ''{{Unicode|℞}}'' note its similarity to the [[Eye of Horus]],<ref>[http://altreligion.about.com/library/glossary/symbols/bldefseyeofhorus.htm Eye of Horus, Eye of Ra (Udjat, Wedjat)]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://egyptphoto.ncf.ca/Egypt%20a%20Perspective13.htm |title=First recorded incidence of the pharmaceutical sign'{{Unicode&#124;℞}}&#125;'|publisher=Egyptphoto.ncf.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}</ref> or to the ancient symbol for [[Zeus]] or [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], ([[Astronomical symbols|♃]]), gods whose protection may have been sought in medical contexts.<ref>{{cite web|author=Amy Beth Dukoff |url=http://www.endomail.com/articles/ad13rx.html |title=Did You Know Where Rx Came From? |publisher=Endomail.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-22}}</ref>

The word "prescription", from "pre-" ("before") and "script" ("writing, written"), refers to the fact that the prescription is an order that must be written down before a compound drug can be prepared.  Those within the industry will often call prescriptions simply "scripts".

The fact that a prescription instructs someone to "take" rather than "give" is not a trivial distinction, but makes clear it is directed at the patient, and is not directly an instruction to anyone else.  In certain states medical marijuana legislation has been drafted calling for a health care professional's written or oral "recommendation", in the belief that a written one would be legally distinguishable from a prescription, but since written advice to a patient is what a prescription is, that belief is mistaken.  Jurisdictions may adopt a statutory definition of "prescription" which is applicable as a term of art only to the operation of that statute (see below about prescriptions that may legally be filled with prescription-only items), but the general legal definition of the word is this broad one.

===Prescription Drug History===
The pharmaceutical business is the most profitable in the nation. People have turned to prescription drugs to ease physical and psychic pain, combat infection, induce sleep, or stop the spread of disease. The top prescription drugs in history consist of antibiotics, mood stabilizers, hormone replacement, oral contraceptives, stimulants, tranquilizers, statins, and Viagra. 

Antibiotics first arrived on the medical scene in 1942; coined the "wonder drugs." Antibiotics inhibits the growth or the metabolic activities of bacteria and other micro organisms by a chemical substance of microbial origin. Penicillin was the first antibiotic to be widely used. Streptomycin found in 1942, proved to be the first drug effective against the cause of tuberculosis and also came to be the best known of a long series of important antibiotics. A second generation of antibiotics were introduced in the 1940's: aureomycin and chloramphenicol. Aureomycin was the best known of the second generation. Antibiotics can be administered through injection; developing countries such as Indonesia, Pakistan, Ghana, Uzbekistan were of fans. The injection of antibiotics was popular in the countries of Africa and Asia also; Africa thought of antibiotics as a cure all for all conditions.<ref>Tone, Andrea and Elizabeth Watkins, Medicating Modern America: Prescription Drugs in History. New York and London, New York University, 2007. Print.</ref> 

Lithium was discovered in the 19th century for nervous disorders and its possible mood-stabilizing or prophylactic effect; it was cheap and easily produced. As lithium fell out of favor in France, valpromide came into play. This antibiotic was the origin of the drug that eventually created the mood stabilizer category. Valpromide had distinct psychotrophic effects that were of benfit in the treatment of both acute manic states and in the maintenance treatment of manic depression illness. Psychotropics can either be sedative or stimulant, Sedatives aim at damping down the extremes of behavior. Stimulants aim at restoring normality by increasing tone. Soon rose the notion of a tranquilizer which was quite different from any sedative or stimulant. The term tranquilizer took over the notions of sedatives and became the dominant term in the West through the 1980's. In Japan, during this time, the term tranquilizer produced the notion of a psyche-stabilizer and the term mood stabilizer vanished.<ref>Tone, Andrea and Elizabeth Watkins, Medicating Modern America: Prescription Drugs in History. New York and London, New York University, 2007. Print.</ref>

Premarin (conjugated estrogens, introduced in 1942) and Prempro (a combination estrogen-progestin pill, introduced in 1995) dominated the hormone replacement therapy (HRT) during the 1990's. HRT is not a life-saving medication, nor does it cure any disease. HRT has been prescribed to improve one's quality of life. Doctors prescribe estrogen for their older female patients both to treat short-term menopausal symptoms and to prevent long term diseases. In the 1960's and early 1970's more and more physicians began to prescribe estrogen for their female patients. between 1991 to 1999, Premarin was listed as the most popular prescription and best selling drug in America.<ref>Tone, Andrea and Elizabeth Watkins, Medicating Modern America: Prescription Drugs in History. New York and London, New York University, 2007. Print.</ref>

The first oral contraceptive, Enovid, was approved by FDA in 1960. Oral contraceptives inhibit ovulation and so prevent conception. Enovid was known to be much more effective than alternatives including the condom and the diaphragm. As early as 1960, oral contraceptives were available in several different strengths by every manufacturer. In the 1980's and 1990's an increasing number of options arose including, most recently, a new delivery system for the oral contraceptive via a transdermal patch. In 1982, a new version of the Pill was introduced, known as the "biphasic" pill. By 1985, a new triphasic pill was approved. Physicians began to think of the Pill as an excellent means of birth control for young women.<ref>Tone, Andrea and Elizabeth Watkins, Medicating Modern America: Prescription Drugs in History. New York and London, New York University, 2007. Print.</ref>

Stimulants such as Ritalin (methylphenidate)came to be pervasive tools for behavior management and modification in young children. Ritalin was first marketed in 1955 for narcolepsy; it's potential users were middle-aged and the elderly.  It wasn't until some time in the 1980's along with hyperactivity in children that Ritalin came onto the market. Medical use of methlyphanidate is predominately for symptoms of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Consumption of methylphenidate in the U.S. outpaces all other countries between 1991 and 1999. Significant growth in consumption was also evident in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Norway. Currently, 85% of the world's methylphanidate is consumed in America.<ref>Tone, Andrea and Elizabeth Watkins, Medicating Modern America: Prescription Drugs in History. New York and London, New York University, 2007. Print.</ref>

The first minor tranquilizer was Meprobamate. Only fourteen months after it was made available, meprobamate had already become the country's largest-selling prescription drug. By 1957, meprobamate had become the fastest-growing drug in history. The popularity of meprobamate paved the way for Librium and Valium, two minor tranquilizers that belonged to a new chemical class of drugs called the benzodiazepines. These were drugs that worked chiefly as anti anxiety agents and muscle relaxants. The first benzodiazepine was Librium. Three months after it was approved, Librium had become the most prescribed tranquilizer in the nation. Three years later Valium hit the shelves and was ten times more effective as a muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant. Valium was the most versatile of the minor tranquilizers. Later came the wide spread adoption of major tranquilizers such as chlorpromazine. In 1970 sales began to decline for Valium and Librium; but sales of new and improved tranquilizers, such as Xanax, introduced in 1981 for the newly created diagnosis of panic disorder soared.<ref>Tone, Andrea and Elizabeth Watkins, Medicating Modern America: Prescription Drugs in History.

[[Image:ValiumDAWAd.png|thumb|200px|Drug companies use direct-to-prescriber advertising in an effort to convince prescribers to dispense as written with brand-name products rather than [[generic drug]]s.]]
Many brand name drugs have cheaper [[generic drug]] substitutes that are therapeutically and biochemically equivalent.  Prescriptions will also contain instructions on whether the prescriber will allow the pharmacist to substitute a generic version of the [[drug]].  This instruction is communicated in a number of ways.

In some jurisdictions, the preprinted prescription contains two signature lines:  one line has "dispense as written" printed underneath; the other line has "substitution permitted" underneath.  Some have a preprinted box "dispense as written" for the prescriber to check off (but this is easily checked off by anyone with access to the prescription).  Other jurisdictions the protocol is for the prescriber to handwrite one of the following phrases: "dispense as written", "DAW", "brand necessary", "do not substitute", "no substitution", "medically necessary", "do not interchange".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://professionals.epilepsy.com/page/statutes_by_pharmacists.html |title=State Laws or Statutes Governing Generic Substitution by Pharmacists |publisher=: Epilepsy.com/Professionals |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2010-01-22}}</ref> In other jurisdictions may they use completely different languages, never mind a different formula of words.  In some jurisdictions, it may be a legal requirement to include the age of child on the prescription.<ref>[http://bnf.org/bnf/bnf/current/doc/29440.htm]{{Citation broken|date=February 2010}}<!-- Access restricted to residents of the UK --></ref> For pediatric prescriptions some advise the inclusion of the age of the child if the patient is less than twelve and the age and months if less than five.  (In general, including the age on the prescription is helpful.)  Adding the weight of the child is also helpful.

Prescriptions often have a "label" box.<ref>{{cite web|author=Davis, T |url=http://www.sh.lsuhsc.edu/fammed/OutpatientManual/PrescripWriting-PDR.htm |title=Prescription Writing and the PDR |publisher=Comprehensive Care Clinic |date=August 30, 2005 |accessdate=2010-01-22}}</ref> When checked, the pharmacist is instructed to label the medication.  When not checked, the patient only receives instructions for taking the medication and no information about the prescription itself.

Some prescribers further inform the patient and pharmacist by providing the indicator for the medication; i.e. what is being treated.  This assists the pharmacist in checking for errors as many common medications can be used for multiple medical conditions.

Some prescriptions will specify whether and how many "repeats" or "refills" are allowed; that is whether the patient may obtain more of the same medication without getting a new prescription from the medical practitioner.  Regulations may restrict some types of drugs from being refilled.

In group practices, the preprinted portion of the prescription may contain multiple prescribers' names.  Prescribers typically circle themselves to indicate who is prescribing or there may be a checkbox next to their name.

===Handling===
When filled by a pharmacist, as a matter of business practice, the pharmacist may write certain information right on the prescription.  This may also be mandated by legislation (see Exhibit D).  Information such as the actual manufacturer of the drug and the date the medication was dispensed may be written right onto the prescription.  Legislation may require the pharmacist to sign the prescription.  In computerized pharmacies, all such information is printed and stapled to the prescription.  Sometimes such information is printed onto labels and the labels affixed right onto the prescription.

When filled by the pharmacist, prescriptions are typically assigned a "prescription number" (often abbreviated "Rx#" in the US) that is unique to the pharmacy that filled the prescription.  The prescription number is written right on the prescription by the pharmacist.  The prescription number has the practical purpose of uniquely identifying the prescription later on while filed (both manual and electronic). The prescription number is also put on the label on the dispensed medication.  The patient may be required to reference the prescription number for refills and drug insurance claims.  There may also be a legal requirement for prescription numbers for subsequent identification purposes.

As a legal document, some jurisdictions will mandate the archiving of the original paper prescription in the pharmacy. Often the patient cannot take the original prescription with them.  Some jurisdictions may entitle patients to a copy.  The retention period varies but can be as long as ten years (requirement of all prescriptions billed to a Medicare Part D plan.) See Exhibit B for sample legislation governing the archiving of prescriptions. Once the retention period has passed, privacy legislation may dictate what can be done with the original paper prescription.  Legislation may also dictate what happens to the prescriptions if the pharmacy closes or is sold.  For example, if the pharmacy goes out of business, the pharmacist may be required to return the prescription to the patient, to the next closest pharmacy or to the governing body for pharmacists.

Prescriptions for non-narcotic drugs may also be "transferred" from one pharmacy to another for subsequent repeats to be dispensed from another pharmacy.  The physical piece of paper that is the prescription is not transferred, but all the information on it is transferred from one pharmacy to another.  Legislation may dictate the protocol by which the transfer occurs and whether the transfer needs to be noted on the original paper prescription.

It is estimated that three [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] prescriptions were written in the United States in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaweekend.com/02_issues/021201/021201healthsmart.html |title=What lurks in your medicine cabinet? |work=[[USA Weekend]] |date=2002-12-01}}{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}</ref> This number grew from 1.5 billion in 1989 and is expected to continue to grow.

===Rx security – forgeries and prevention===
Prescriptions are sometimes forged because many [[narcotic]]s are cheaper and safer as prescription drugs than as street drugs. Forgery takes many forms:  Prescription pads are sometimes stolen, amounts may be altered on legitimate prescriptions, call back numbers may be falsified and phoned or faxed prescriptions faked.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/pubs/brochures/pharmguide.htm | title = A Pharmacist's Guide to Prescription Fraud |date = February 2000| publisher = US DOJ Drug Enforcement Administration Office of Diversion Control }}</ref>

To make photocopying prescriptions more difficult, some medical practitioners use prescription pads that contain security measures similar to those used on bank checks.  These security measures may be mandated by law—see Exhibit C for sample legal specifications.  Legislation may mandate that only certain printers may print prescriptions.<ref>[http://www.in.gov/pla/bandc/isbp/pad.html]{{Dead link|date=July 2008}}</ref> New Jersey, for example, requires that only state approved printers may be used to print official "New Jersey Prescription Blanks."<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/lps/ca/njpb.htm]{{Dead link|date=July 2008}}</ref> (See Exhibit E.)  Prescribers can make it more difficult to forge dosages and quantities by writing out numbers in words.  Again, this may be mandated by law.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.cpsa.ab.ca/collegeprograms/attachments_tpp/tpp%20information%20for%20prescriber.doc]{{Dead link|date=July 2008}}</ref>

{{Wikinews|Canadian woman faces 234 counts of double-doctoring}}
Some jurisdictions help control stolen prescriptions by requiring special "triplicate prescriptions" for certain classes of drugs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsa.ab.ca/Services/Triplicate_Prescription_Program/TPP_FAQs.aspx |title=CPSA Triplicate Prescription Program |publisher=Cpsa.ab.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}</ref> Blank triplicates are only available from the regulating agency and are individually numbered.  The medical practitioner retains a copy, the second and third copies are given to the patient to give to the pharmacist.  The pharmacist retains the second copy and the third copy is submitted to the regulating agency.  The regulating agency can issue lists of forged prescriptions that pharmacists can check.  In this example, the prescription's validity is further limited to 72 hours from issuance.  [[California]] has recently replaced triplicate forms with new forms that are impossible to photocopy or fax: the background is printed with repetitions of the word ''void'' in a color that shows up as black on a photocopy.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

States have various laws making theft of prescription blanks or forgery of prescriptions criminal offenses and/or providing special treatment for these offenses (for Example N.J. Stat. 2C:21-1. making forgery of a prescription blank a third degree rather than fourth degree offense).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2000/Bills/PL01/110_.HTM |title=An Act concerning forgery and amending N.J.S.2C:21-1 and supplementing Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes |date= |accessdate=2010-01-22}}</ref>

When forgery is suspected, pharmacists will call the medical practitioner to verify the prescription.  Forged prescriptions are no longer considered medical documents and doctor-patient confidentiality rules no longer apply.

==Writing prescriptions==

===Who can write prescriptions (that may legally be filled with prescription-only items)===
Any jurisdiction that allows freedom of written communication generally must therefore allow anybody to write a prescription to anybody, inasmuch as the prescription itself is just written advice.  Therefore "who can ''write'' prescriptions" will be explained below as shorthand for "whose prescriptions may legally be filled with items restricted to dispensing via the order of certain persons".

National or local (i.e. state or provincial) legislation governs who can write a prescription.  In North America, physicians (either [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]]) have the broadest prescriptive authority. All 50 States and the District of Columbia allow licensed certified [[Physician Assistant]]s (PAs) prescription authority (with some limitations to controlled substances). All 50 States allow registered certified [[nurse practitioner]]s and other [[advanced practice registered nurse]]s (such as [[Nurse midwife|certified nurse-midmives]]) prescription power (with some states including limitations to controlled substances).<ref>{{cite web

===Legibility===
Prescriptions, when handwritten, are notorious for being often illegible. In the US, medical practitioners' sloppy handwriting kills more than 70,000 people annually,{{POV-statement|date=March 2012}} according to a July 2006 report from the National Academies of Science's Institute of Medicine (IOM).<ref>{{cite news|last=Caplan |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1578074,00.html |title=Cause of Death: Sloppy Doctors |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=2007-01-15 |accessdate=2010-01-22}}</ref> Historically, physicians used Latin words and abbreviations to convey the entire prescription to the pharmacist. Today, many of the abbreviations are still widely used and must be understood to interpret prescriptions. At other times, even though some of the individual letters are illegible, the position of the legible letters and length of the word is sufficient to distinguish the medication based on the knowledge of the pharmacist. When in doubt, pharmacists call the medical practitioner. Some jurisdictions have legislated legible prescriptions (e.g. Florida).<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=Ch0456/SEC42.HTM&Title=-%3E2008-%3ECh0456-%3ESection%2042 | title = 456.42 Written prescriptions for medicinal drugs | work = Florida Statutes}}</ref> Some have advocated the elimination of handwritten prescriptions altogether<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ismp.org/msaarticles/whitepaper.html |title=Eliminate Handwritten Prescriptions Within 3 Years |publisher=Institute for Safe Medication Practices |date=1999-12-07 |accessdate=2010-01-22}}</ref> and [[computer printer|computer printed]] prescriptions are becoming increasingly common in some places.

===Conventions for avoiding ambiguity===
Over the years, prescribers have developed many conventions for prescription-writing, with the goal of avoiding ambiguities or misinterpretation.<ref>[http://bnf.org/bnf/bnf/current/doc/29420.htm]{{Citation broken|date=February 2010}}<!-- Access restricted to residents of the UK --></ref><ref>[http://www.healthlibrary.com/reading/rdb/april98/good.htm]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}</ref><ref>

These include:
*Careful use of decimal points to avoid ambiguity:
**Avoiding unnecessary decimal points: a prescription will be written as 5&nbsp;mL instead of 5.0&nbsp;mL to avoid possible misinterpretation of 5.0 as 50.
**Always using zero prefix decimals: e.g. 0.5 instead of .5 to avoid misinterpretation of .5 as 5.
**Avoiding trailing zeros on decimals:  e.g. 0.5 instead of .50 to avoid misinterpretation of .50 as 50.
*"[[litre|mL]]" is used instead of "[[Cubic centimetre|cc]]" or "cm³" even though they are technically equivalent to avoid misinterpretation of 'c' as '0' or the common medical abbreviation for "with" (the Latin "''cum''"), which is written as a 'c' with a bar above the letter.  Further, cc could be misinterpreted as "c.c.", which is an uncommonly used abbreviation for "take with meals" (the Latin "''cum cibo''").
*Directions written out in full in English (although some common Latin abbreviations are listed below).
*Quantities given directly or implied by the frequency and duration of the directions.
*Where the directions are "as needed", the quantity should always be specified.
*Where possible, usage directions should specify times (7 am, 3 pm, 11 pm) rather than simply frequency (three times a day) and especially relationship to meals for orally consumed medication.
*The use of permanent ink.
*Avoiding units such as "teaspoons" or "tablespoons."
*Writing out numbers as words ''and'' numerals ("dispense #30 (thirty)") as in a [[bank draft]] or [[cheque]].
*The use of [[apothecary]]/[[avoirdupois]] units and symbols of measure -- [[pint]]s ('''O'''), [[ounce]]s ('''℥'''), [[dram (unit)|dram]]s ('''ℨ'''), [[scruple]]s ('''℈'''), [[grain (measure)|grain]]s ('''gr'''), and [[minim (volume)|minim]]s ('''♏''') -- is discouraged given the potential for confusion.  For example, the abbreviation for a grain ("gr") can be confused with the [[gram]], abbreviated [[gram|g]], and the symbol for minims (♏), which looks almost identical to an 'm', can be confused with [[microgram]]s or [[metre]]s.  Also, the symbols for ounce (℥) and dram (ℨ) can easily be confused with the numeral '3', and the symbol for pint (O) can be easily read as a '0'.  Given the potential for errors, [[metric system|metric]] equivalents should always be used.
*The use of the degree symbol (°), which is commonly used as an abbreviation for hours (e.g., "q 2-4°" for every 2 – 4 hours), should not be used, since it can be confused with a '0'.  Further, the use of the degree symbol for primary, secondary, and tertiary (1°, 2°, and 3°) is discouraged, since the former could be confused with quantities (i.e. 10, 20 and 30, respectively).

===Abbreviations===
See [[list of abbreviations used in medical prescriptions]].  Many abbreviations are derived from Latin phrases.  Hospital pharmacies have more abbreviations, some specific to the hospital.  Different jurisdictions follow different conventions on what is abbreviated or not. Prescriptions that don't follow area conventions may be flagged as possible forgeries.

Some abbreviations which are ambiguous, or which in their written form might be confused with something else, are not recommended and should be avoided. These are included in a separate list in Appendix 1. However, all abbreviations carry an increased risk for confusion and misinterpretation and should be used cautiously.

==In Continental Europe==
In continental Europe, prescriptions differ from their counterparts in the [[Anglosphere]].  With the exception of patient directions, they are written out entirely in [[abbreviations]] deriving from the [[Latin language]].  Furthermore, a larger proportion of prescriptions are compounded, and appropriate abbreviations and phrases exist for this. Many medical schools require up to two years of Latin as part of the curriculum for medical doctors and pharmacists.

===Parts of a European prescription===

A continental European prescription consists of three parts:

* the ''inscritio'', also known as the ''superscriptio'', is the header of the prescription and consists of the patient's name, address, and [[identity document]] number, as well as the identifying number of the patient's [[private health insurance]] [[company]], if applicable; and
* the ''praescriptio'' is the prescription itself; that is, directions to the [[dispensing pharmacist]] to supply [[medication]], made up of the following:
** the ''invocatio'', consisting of the abbreviation ''Rp''; this is analogous to the ''Rx'' used in the [[Anglosphere]], and stands for ''recipe'', Latin for ''take [from the shelf]''; and
** the ''ordinatio'', also known as the ''compositio'', which consists either of the brand name, strength, and number and type of dosage units of a particular drug, or else of directions written entirely in the Latin [[accusative case]], with the exception of ingredient names, written in the [[genitive case]].  Masses are written in [[grammes]], without the unit name.  The ''compositio'' is followed by
* the ''subscriptio'', which consists of the directions according to which the medicament is to be prepared.  An important part of this is the ''signatura'', which is directed towards the patient and explains how to use the medication.  Unlike the rest of the prescription, the ''signatura'' is written in the national [[vernacular]].

===Other conventions===

Should a patient require a dosage in excess of the maximum as established by the appropriate governmental body, this is marked by an exclamation mark and the highest recommended dosage in Latin.  If this is not done, it is the responsibility of the pharmacist to contact the doctor as to dose requirements, or amend the dose to the highest recommended one.

In emergency situations, a prescription pad may not be available.  In this situation, any piece of paper will do, provided it is marked ''Periculum in mora!''; that is, ''danger in delay'' (other designations, such as ''Cito!'' or ''Statim!'', are also used and understood).  Such ad-hoc prescriptions have a limited period of validity; typically, this is the day after the prescription is written.

A doctor may self-prescribe, or prescribe for his family; this is done by replacing the ''signatura'' by the Latin phrase ''pro manus medici'' (for medical hands) or ''ad usum proprium'' (for own use).  This is to be done with caution; certain drugs self-prescribed will arouse suspicion, and may result in investigation by the medical board or another governmental body.

Brand-name drugs may be swapped for generics; if this is not wanted by the doctor, he may write ''dispense as written'' in the local language on the prescription.

==Non-prescription drug prescriptions==
Prescriptions are also used for things that are not strictly regulated as a prescription drug.  Prescribers will often give non-prescription drugs out as prescriptions because drug benefit plans may reimburse the patient only if the over-the-counter medication is taken under the direction of a medical practitioner.  Conversely, if a medication is available over-the-counter, prescribers may ask patients if they want it as a prescription or purchase it themselves.  Pharmacists may or may not be able to price the medication competitively with over-the-counter equivalents.  If the patient wants the medication not under prescription, the prescriber is usually careful to give the medication name to the patient on a blank piece of paper to avoid any confusion with a prescription.  This is applied to non-medications as well.  For example, crutches, and registered massage therapy may be reimbursed under some health plans, but only if given out by a prescriber as a prescription.

Prescribers will often use blank prescriptions as general letterhead.  Legislation may define certain equipment as "prescription devices".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?FR=801.109 |title=CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2010-01-22}}</ref> Such prescription devices can only be used under the supervision of authorized personnel and such authorization is typically documented using a prescription.  Examples of prescription devices include dental cement (for affixing [[dental brace|braces]] to tooth surfaces), various prostheses, gut sutures, sickle cell tests, cervical cap and ultrasound monitor.

In some jurisdictions, hypodermic syringes are in a special class of their own, regulated as illicit drug use accessories<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1954&ChapAct=720%26nbsp%3BILCS%26nbsp%3B635%2F&ChapterID=53&ChapterName=CRIMINAL+OFFENSES&ActName=Hypodermic+Syringes+and+Needles+Act%2E | title = (720 ILCS 635/) Hypodermic Syringes and Needles Act | work = Illinois Compiled Statutes}}</ref> separate from regular medical legislation.  Such legislation will often specify a prescription as the means by which one may legally possess syringes.

==Related usage of the term ''prescription''==
'''''Prescription''''' may also be used as a short form for '''[[prescription drug]]s''' to distinguish from [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] drugs. In reference to the entire system of controlling drug distribution (as opposed to illicit drugs), "prescription" is often used as a metaphor for healthy directions from a prescribing medical practitioner.  A [[green prescription]] is direction from a medical practitioner to a patient for exercise and healthy diet.

==History==<!-- This section is linked from [[Hippocratic Oath]] -->
The concept of prescriptions dates back to the beginning of history. So long as there were [[medication]]s and a [[writing system]] to capture directions for preparation and usage, there were prescriptions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmacy.wsu.edu/History/history02.html |title=Pharmacy in Ancient Babylonia | work=History of Pharmacy |publisher=Washington State University College of Pharmacy |date= |accessdate=2010-01-22}}</ref>

Modern prescriptions are actually "extemporaneous prescriptions" from the Latin (''ex tempore'') for "at/from time".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=extemporaneous |title=Extemporaneous definition |publisher=M-w.com |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2010-01-22}}</ref> "Extemporaneous" means the prescription is written on the spot for a specific patient with a specific ailment.  This is distinguished from a non-extemporaneous prescription which is a generic recipe for a general ailment.  Modern prescriptions evolved with the separation of the role of the pharmacists from that of the physician.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/65/ph/pharmacy.html]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}</ref> Today the term "extemporaneous prescriptions" is reserved for "compound prescriptions" which requires the pharmacist to mix or "compound" the medication in the pharmacy for the specific needs of the patient.

Predating modern legal definitions of a prescription, a prescription traditionally is composed of four parts:  a "superscription", "inscription", "subscription" and "signature".<ref>
{{cite book
| title = A Compend of Materia Medica, Therapeutics, and Prescription Writing
| author =Potter, Samuel O.L.
| chapter = Prescription Writing
| chapterurl = http://www.henriettesherbal.com/eclectic/potter-comp/prescription.html
| year= 1902

The superscription section contains the date of the prescription and patient information (name, address, age, etc.).  The symbol "{{Unicode|℞}}" separates the superscription from the inscriptions sections.  In this arrangement of the prescription, the "{{Unicode|℞}}" is a symbol for ''recipe'' or literally the imperative "take."  This is an exhortation to the pharmacist by the medical practitioner, "I want the patient to have the following medication"<ref>[http://www.vnh.org/HospitalCorpsman14295/14295_ch6.pdf]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}</ref> - in other words, "take the following components and compound this medication for the patient."

The inscription section defines what is the medication. The inscription section is further composed of one or more of:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Therapeutics |title=Therapeutics |publisher=LoveToKnow Free Online Encyclopedia |date=2006-02-15 |accessdate=2010-01-22}}</ref>
* a "basis" or chief ingredient indended to cure (''curare'')
* an "adjuvant" to assist its action and make it cure quickly (''cito'')
* a "corrective" to prevent or lessen any undesirable effect (''tuto'')
* a "vehicle" or "excipient" to make it suitable for administration and pleasant to the patient (''jucunde'')

The "subscription" section contains dispensing directions to the pharmacist. This may be compounding instructions or quantities.

The "signature" section contains directions to the patient<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=signature |title=Signature definition |publisher=M-w.com |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2010-01-22}}</ref> and is often abbreviated "Sig."<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/61/96/S0399600.html]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}</ref> or "Signa."<ref>Ansel, H. ''Pharmaceutical Calculations''. 13th edition, Philadelphia. Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins. 2010. p59-60.</ref>  It also obviously contains the signature of the prescribing medical practitioner though the word "signature" has two distinct meanings here and the abbreviations are sometimes used to avoid confusion.

Thus sample prescriptions in modern textbooks are often presented as:
 '''{{Unicode|℞}}:'''  medication
 '''Disp.:'''  dispensing instructions
 '''Sig.:''' patient instructions

==Use of technology==
As a prescription is nothing more than information among a prescriber, pharmacist and patient, information technology can be applied to it. Existing information technology is adequate to print out prescriptions. [[Medical information system]]s in some hospitals do away with prescriptions within the hospital. There are proposals to securely transmit the prescription from the prescriber to the pharmacist using [[smartcard]] or the internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computer.org/proceedings/hicss/1435/volume6/14350156babs.htm |title=IEEE Computer Society Conference Publishing Services}}{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}</ref> In the [[United Kingdom]] a project called the Electronic Transfer of Prescriptions (ETP) within the National Programme for IT ([[NPfIT]]) is currently piloting such a scheme between prescribers and pharmacies.

Within computerized pharmacies, the information on paper prescriptions is recorded into a database. Afterwards, the paper prescription is archived for storage and legal reasons.

A pharmacy chain is often linked together through corporate headquarters with [[computer networking]].  [[Walgreens]], for example, uses satellite technology to share patient information.  A person who has a prescription filled at one Walgreens can get a refill of that prescription at any other store in the chain, as well as have their information available for new prescriptions at any Walgreens.

Some [[online pharmacy|online pharmacies]] also offer services to customers over the internet.  Walgreens' web site, for example, allows customers to order refills for medicine over the internet, and allows them to specify the store that they will pick up the medicine from.  Their web site also allows consumers to look up their prescription history, and to print it out.

Many pharmacies now offer services to ship prescription refills right to the patient's home. [[CVS/pharmacy|CVS]], for example, will ship refills free of charge. They also offer mail service where you can mail in a new, original prescription and a signed document, and they will ship the filled prescription back to you.

Pharmacy information systems are a potential source of valuable information for pharmaceutical companies as it contains information about the prescriber's prescribing habits.  Prescription [[data mining]] of such data is a developing, specialized field.<ref>

Many prescribers lack the digitized information systems that reduce prescribing errors.<ref>Zwarenstein 2007</ref> To reduce these errors, some investigators have developed modified prescription forms that prompt the prescriber to provide all the desired elements of a good prescription. The modified forms also contain pre-defined choices such as common quantities, units and frequencies that the prescriber may circle rather than write out. Such forms are thought to reduce errors, especially omission and handwriting errors and are actively under evaluation. (See: Kennedy AG, Littenberg B. A Modified Outpatient Prescription Form to Reduce Prescription Errors. ''Joint Commission Journal of Quality and Safety'' 2004; 30:480-487.)
