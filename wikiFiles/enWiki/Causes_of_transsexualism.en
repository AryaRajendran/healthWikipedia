The '''etiology of transsexualism''', meaning the cause or causes of [[transsexualism]], is an area of interest for many [[Gender identity disorder|transgender]] and transsexual people, [[physician]]s, [[psychologist]]s, other [[mental health]] professionals, and family members and friends of transsexual people. Transsexualism usually presents with an expression of [[gender identity]] different from the gender assigned at birth, behaviors typical of that gender, and discomfort called [[gender dysphoria]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Transgender experiences – Information and support|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_097168.pdf|publisher=NHS|accessdate=2012-07-01|author=Curtis, R.|coauthors=et. al.|pages=12|format=PDF|month=March|year=2009}}</ref>  Currently, there are numerous scientific explanations of the cause of transsexualism, linking the cause to genetics, brain structure, brain function and prenatal androgen exposure; in addition, other theories have proposed linking the cause to psychological and behavioral reasons. These theories are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

==Psychological and behavioral theories==

===Rearing / Trauma===
For many years, many people, including [[psychiatrist]] and [[sexologist]] [[David Oliver Cauldwell]],<ref>[http://www.wpath.org/journal/www.iiav.nl/ezines/web/IJT/97-03/numbers/symposion/cauldwell_03.htm Desire for Surgical Sex Transmutation: An Insane Fancy of Near Males.] D.O. Cauldwell. 2001 reprint in the International Journal of Transgenderism Vol. 5 Number 2 of a paper published in 1947.</ref> argued that transsexualism is a psychological/emotional disorder caused by psychological factors.

[[Harry Benjamin]] wrote, "Our genetic and endocrine equipment constitutes either an unresponsive [or] fertile soil on which the wrong conditioning and a [[Psychological trauma|psychic trauma]] can grow and develop into such a basic conflict that subsequently a deviation like transsexualism can result."<ref>Benjamin, H. (1966).  ''The transsexual phenomenon.'' New York: Julian Press, page 85.</ref>

The unsuccessful outcome of an attempt to raise [[David Reimer]], the victim of an early accidental genital mutilation, as a girl from infancy through adolescence is cited as disproof of the theory that one's inborn sense of gender is developed through parenting.<ref>{{cite web|title=David Reimer, subject of 'sex reassignment,' dead at 38|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/May/13/ln/ln52a.html}}</ref><ref name = Colapinto>{{cite book | last = Colapinto  | first = J | title = As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl | publisher = [[Harper Perennial]] | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-06-092959-6 | authorlink = John Colapinto}} Revised in 2006</ref>  His case is used by organizations such as The [[Intersex Society of North America]] as a cautionary tale about why one should not needlessly modify the genitals of unconsenting minors.<ref>[http://www.isna.org/faq/reimer Intersex Society of North America | A world free of shame, secrecy, and unwanted genital surgery]</ref>

==Biological-based theories==

===Genetics===
The [[androgen receptor]] (AR), also known as NR3C4, is activated by the binding of [[testosterone]] or [[dihydrotestosterone]], where it plays a critical role in the forming of [[primary sexual characteristics|primary]] and [[secondary sexual characteristics|secondary]] male sex characteristics. Hare ''et al.'' found that male-to-female transsexuals were found to have longer repeat lengths on the gene, which reduced its effectiveness at binding [[testosterone]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hare |first1=L |last2=Bernard |first2=P |last3=Sanchez |first3=F |last4=Baird |first4=P |last5=Vilain |first5=E |last6=Kennedy |first6=T |last7=Harley |first7=V |title=Androgen Receptor Repeat Length Polymorphism Associated with Male-to-Female Transsexualism |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=93–6 |year=2009 |pmid=18962445 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.08.033}}</ref>

A variant genotype for a gene called [[CYP17A1|CYP17]], which acts on the sex hormones [[pregnenolone]] and [[progesterone]], has been found to be linked to [[female-to-male transsexual]]ism but not MTF transsexualism.  Most notably, the FTM subjects not only had the variant genotype more frequently, but had an allele distribution equivalent to male controls, unlike the female controls. The paper concluded that the loss of a female-specific CYP17 T -34C allele distribution pattern is associated with FtM transsexualism.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bentz |first1=E |last2=Hefler |first2=L |last3=Kaufmann |first3=U |last4=Huber |first4=J |last5=Kolbus |first5=A |last6=Tempfer |first6=C |title=A polymorphism of the CYP17 gene related to sex steroid metabolism is associated with female-to-male but not male-to-female transsexualism |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=56–9 |year=2008 |pmid=17765230 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.05.056}}</ref>

===Brain structure===
In a first-of-its-kind study, Zhou ''et al.'' (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the [[stria terminalis]] (BSTc), a region known for sex and [[anxiety response]]s, MTF transsexuals have a female-normal size while FTM transsexuals have a male-normal size.  While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including non-transsexual male and female controls which, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still retained sizes typical for their gender. No relationship to sexual orientation was found.<ref name="Zhou/Gooren">{{cite journal |last1=Zhou |first1=Jiang-Ning |last2=Hofman |first2=Michel A. |last3=Gooren |first3=Louis J. G. |last4=Swaab |first4=Dick F. |title=A sex difference in the human brain and its relation to transsexuality |journal=Nature |volume=378 |issue=6552 |pages=68–70 |year=1995 |pmid=7477289 |doi=10.1038/378068a0}}</ref>

In a follow-up study, Kruijver ''et al.'' (2000) looked at the number of neurons in BSTc instead of volumes.  They found the same results as Zhou ''et al.'' (1995), but with even more dramatic differences. One MTF subject who had never gone on hormones was also included, and who matched up with the female neuron counts nonetheless.<ref name="Kruijver">{{cite journal |last1=Kruijver |first1=F. P. M. |last2=Zhou |first2=JN |last3=Pool |first3=CW |last4=Hofman |first4=MA |last5=Gooren |first5=LJ |last6=Swaab |first6=DF |title=Male-to-Female Transsexuals Have Female Neuron Numbers in a Limbic Nucleus |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=2034–41 |year=2000 |doi=10.1210/jc.85.5.2034 |pmid=10843193}}</ref>

In 2002, a follow-up study by Chung ''et al.'' found that significant sexual dimorphism (variation between sexes) in BSTc did not become established until adulthood.  Chung ''et al.'' theorized that either changes in fetal hormone levels produce changes in BSTc synaptic density, neuronal activity, or neurochemical content which later lead to size and neuron count changes in BSTc, or that the size of BSTc is affected by the failure to generate a gender identity consistent with one's anatomic sex.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chung |first1=WC |last2=De Vries |first2=GJ |last3=Swaab |first3=DF |title=Sexual differentiation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in humans may extend into adulthood |journal=The Journal of neuroscience |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=1027–33 |year=2002 |pmid=11826131}}</ref>

In a review of the evidence in 2006, Gooren confirms the earlier research as supporting the concept that transsexualism is a sexual differentiation disorder of the sex dimorphic brain.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gooren |first1=L |title=The biology of human psychosexual differentiation |journal=Hormones and behavior |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=589–601 |year=2006 |pmid=16870186 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2006.06.011}}</ref> [[Dick Swaab]] (2004) concurs.<ref name="number11">{{cite journal |last1=Swaab |first1=DF |title=Sexual differentiation of the human brain: relevance for gender identity, transsexualism and sexual orientation |journal=Gynecological Endocrinology |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=301–12 |year=2004 |pmid=15724806 |doi=10.1080/09513590400018231}}</ref>

In 2008, a new region with properties similar to that of BSTc in regards to transsexualism was found by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab: the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou ''et al.'' (1995) and Kruijver ''et al.'' (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MTF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FTM transsexual within the male range.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Garcia-Falgueras |first1=A. |last2=Swaab |first2=D. F. |title=A sex difference in the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus: relationship to gender identity |journal=Brain |volume=131 |issue=Pt 12 |pages=3132–46 |year=2008 |pmid=18980961 |doi=10.1093/brain/awn276}}</ref>

While [[MRI]] images cannot resolve as fine details as structures such as BSTc and INAH3, they can much more easily allow the study of larger brain structures. In Luders ''et al.'' (2009), 24 MTF transsexuals not-yet treated with cross-sex hormones were studied via MRI. While regional [[gray matter]] concentrations were more similar to men than women, there was a significantly larger volume of gray matter in the right [[putamen]] compared to men. As with many earlier studies, they concluded that transsexualism is associated with a distinct cerebral pattern.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Luders |first1=Eileen |last2=Sánchez |first2=Francisco J. |last3=Gaser |first3=Christian |last4=Toga |first4=Arthur W. |last5=Narr |first5=Katherine L. |last6=Hamilton |first6=Liberty S. |last7=Vilain |first7=Eric |title=Regional gray matter variation in male-to-female transsexualism |journal=NeuroImage |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=904–7 |year=2009 |pmid=19341803 |pmc=2754583 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.03.048}}</ref>

An additional feature was studied in a group of FTM transsexuals who had not yet received cross-sex hormones: [[fractional anisotropy]] values for [[white matter]] in the medial and posterior parts of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the forceps minor, and the corticospinal tract. Rametti ''et al.'' (2010) discovered that, "Compared to control females, FtM showed higher FA values in posterior part of the right SLF, the forceps minor and corticospinal tract. Compared to control males, FtM showed only lower FA values in the corticospinal tract."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rametti |first1=G |last2=Carrillo |first2=B |last3=Gómez-Gil |first3=E |last4=Junque |first4=C |last5=Segovia |first5=S |last6=Gomez |first6=A |last7=Guillamon |first7=A |title=White matter microstructure in female to male transsexuals before cross-sex hormonal treatment.

Hulshoff Pol ''et al.'' (2006), studied the gross brain volume of subjects undergoing hormone treatment. They discovered that whole brain volume for subjects changes toward the size of the opposite reproductive sex during hormone treatment.  The conclusion of the study was, "The findings suggest that, throughout life, gonadal hormones remain essential for maintaining aspects of sex-specific differences in the human brain."<ref name="CSCB">{{cite journal |last1=Pol |first1=H.

===Brain function===
[[Phantom limb syndrome]] is a common, often painful experience after the loss of an external organ. Ramachandran (2008) found that while nearly two thirds of non-transsexual males who have a penis surgically removed experience the sensation of a phantom penis, only one third of MTF transsexuals do so after [[male-to-female sex reassignment surgery|sex reassignment surgery]]. Perhaps more remarkably, two-thirds of FTM transsexuals reported the sensation of a phantom penis from childhood onwards, replete with phantom erections and other phenomena.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ramachandran |first=V. S. |title=Phantom Penises In Transsexuals |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=5–16 |year=2008 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&issn=1355-8250&volume=15&issue=1&spage=5&epage=16}}</ref>

Berglund ''et al.'' (2008) tested the response of [[gynephilia|gynephilic]] MTF transsexuals to two sex pheromones: the progestin-like 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and the estrogen-like 1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST). Despite the difference in sexuality, the MTFs' hypothalamic networks activated in response to AND, like the [[androphilia|androphilic]] female control groups. Both groups experienced amygdala activation in response to EST. Male control groups (gynephilic) experienced hypothalamic activation in response to EST. However, the MTF subjects also experienced limited hypothalamic activation to EST as well. The researchers' conclusion was, that in terms of pheromone activation, MTF's occupy an intermediate position with predominantly female features.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Berglund |first1=H. |last2=Lindstrom |first2=P. |last3=Dhejne-Helmy |first3=C. |last4=Savic |first4=I. |title=Male-to-Female Transsexuals Show Sex-Atypical Hypothalamus Activation When Smelling Odorous Steroids |journal=Cerebral Cortex |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=1900–8 |year=2007 |pmid=18056697 |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhm216}}</ref> The MTF transsexual subjects had not undergone any hormonal treatment at the time of the study, according to their own declaration beforehand, and confirmed by repeated tests of hormonal levels.<ref>[http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/8/1900.full Male-to-Female Transsexuals Show Sex-Atypical Hypothalamus Activation When Smelling Odorous Steroids (full article)]</ref>

===Prenatal androgen exposure===
Prenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between [[digit ratio]] (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male to female transsexualism. MTF transsexuals were found to have a higher digit ratio than control males, but one that was comparable to control females.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schneider |first1=H |last2=Pickel |first2=J |last3=Stalla |first3=G |title=Typical female 2nd–4th finger length (2D:4D) ratios in male-to-female transsexuals—possible implications for prenatal androgen exposure |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=265–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16140461 |doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2005.07.005}}</ref>
