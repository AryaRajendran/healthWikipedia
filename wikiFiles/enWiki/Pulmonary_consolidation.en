A '''pulmonary consolidation''' is a region of (normally compressible) [[lung]] tissue that has filled with liquid,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwmednlm?book=Medical&va=consolidation|title=Consolidation - Definition|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2009-01-16}}</ref> a condition marked by induration<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwmednlm?book=Medical&va=induration|title=Induration- Definition|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2009-01-16}}</ref> (swelling or hardening of normally soft tissue) of a normally aerated lung. It is considered a [[radiologic sign]]. Consolidation occurs through accumulation of inflammatory cellular exudate in the [[alveoli]] and adjoining ducts. Simply, it is defined as alveolar space that contains liquid instead of gas. The fluid can be pulmonary [[edema]], inflammatory [[exudate]], [[pus]], inhaled water, or blood (from bronchial tree or [[hemorrhage]] from a [[pulmonary artery]]). It is clinically important in [[pneumonia]]: the signs of lobar pneumonia are characteristic and clinically referred to as consolidation.{{ref|Metlay}} 

==Signs==
Signs that consolidation may have occurred include:
*Expansion of the thorax on inspiration is reduced on the affected side
*[[Vocal fremitus]] is increased on the side with consolidation
*Percussion is dull in affected area
*Breath sounds are bronchial
*Possible medium, late, or pan-inspiratory [[crackles]]
*[[Vocal resonance]] is increased. . Here, the patient's voice (or whisper, as in [[whispered pectoriloquy]]) can be heard more clearly when there is consolidation, as opposed to in the healthy lung where speech sounds muffled.
*A pleural rub may be present{{ref|talley}}

==Radiology==
* Typically, an area of white lung is seen on a standard X-ray. <ref>{{cite book| Corne et al.|title = Chest X-Ray Made Easy|publisher = Churchill Livingstone|year = 2002|isbn = 0-443-07008-3}}</ref> Consolidated tissue is more radio-opaque than normally aerated lung parenchyma, so that it is clearly demonstrable in [[radiography]] and on [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]]. Consolidation is often a middle-to-late stage feature/complication in [[pulmonary]] infections.

<!-- How to add a footnote: 
   NOTE: Footnotes in this article use names, not numbers. Please see [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] for details.
     1) Assign your footnote a unique name, for example TheSun_Dec9. 
     2) Add the macro {{ref|TheSun_Dec9}} to the body of the article, where you want the new footnote.
     3) Take note of the name of the footnote that immediately precedes yours in the article body. 
     4) Add #{{Note|TheSun_Dec9}} to the list, immediately below the footnote you noted in step 3.  No need to re-number anything!
     5) Multiple footnotes to the same reference: see [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] for a how-to.
   NOTE: It is important to add footnotes in the right order in the list!
