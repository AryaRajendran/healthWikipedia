An '''esophageal motility study''' (EMS) or '''esophageal manometry''' is a test to assess motor function of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), esophageal body and lower esophageal sphincter (LES).

==Indications==
An EMS is typically done to evaluate suspected disorders of [[motility]] or [[peristalsis]] of the esophagus. These include [[achalasia]], [[esophageal spasm|diffuse esophageal spasm]], [[nutcracker esophagus]] and [[lower esophageal sphincter|hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter]]. These disorders typically present with [[dysphagia]], or difficulty swallowing, usually to both solids and liquids even initially. Other patients with spasm disorders may have the test done to diagnose [[chest pain]] thought not to be of cardiac cause. 

The test is not useful for anatomical disorders of the esophagus (that is, disorders that distort the anatomy of the esophagus), such as [[esophageal stricture|peptic strictures]] and [[esophageal cancer]].

==Procedure==
A technician places a catheter into the nose and guides it into the stomach. Once placed, the catheter is slowly withdrawn, allowing it to detect pressure changes and to record information for later review. The patient will be asked at times to take a deep breath or to take some swallows of water. The degree of discomfort varies among patients. Patients are not sedated because sedatives would alter the functioning of the esophageal muscles. Overall the procedure takes about 45 minutes. After the procedure is complete, patients can usually resume their normal daily activities.

==Recent advances ==
Recently,{{when?|date=November 2012}} [[high resolution manometry]] (HRM) has been developed that significantly reduces the procedure time (10 minutes versus 45 minutes with conventional manometry) and provides enhanced patient comfort. Newer catheters incorporate concurrent impedance with HRM.
