'''HONOReform''' (Hepatitis Outbreaks National Organization for Reform) – is a [[patient advocacy]] organization that seeks to promote adherence to [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] safety guidelines and increase governmental oversight of [[outpatient]] medical facilities.  In addition to promoting lessons learned from outbreaks of [[hepatitis C]], the organization advocates for a more compassionate response to large scale medical disasters.<ref name="HONOReform - About Us">[http://75.126.152.5/~hardtime/HONOR/aboutus.html HONOReform - About Us]</ref>

HONOReform was founded by patients and families impacted by a [[Nebraska]] outbreak of hepatitis C in which 99 cancer patients were infected when doctors and nurses at their oncology clinic were found to have reused syringes.  For years it remained the largest outbreak of hepatitis C in American healthcare history, though similar [[Tragedy (event)|tragedies]] continue to occur.  

Since 1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has documented 33 outbreaks of [[hepatitis B]] and C as a result of negligent injection safety practices in nonhospital healthcare settings. In January 2009, the ''Annals of Internal Medicine'' noted over 60,000 patients have been verified by the CDC to be potentially exposed to hepatitis in the outbreaks and that these outbreaks are likely only "the tip of the iceberg".<ref>[http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/abstract/150/1/33 Annals of Internal Medicine: Nonhospital Health Care–Associated Hepatitis B and C Virus Transmission: United States, 1998–2008]</ref><ref name="cbsnews.com">[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/02/25/eveningnews/main3875991.shtml CBS Evening News: Hepatitis C Danger In Your MD's Office? - February 25, 2008]</ref>

==History==
HONOReform was founded by Evelyn McKnight, Dr. Tom McKnight, and Travis Bennington, all of Fremont, Nebraska.  Evelyn McKnight is an [[audiologist]] who was battling a recurrence of [[breast cancer]] when she learned she had been infected with hepatitis C because improper injection safety protocols at the Fremont Cancer Center.<ref>[http://www.nlc.state.ne.us/epubs/L3790/B067-2007.pdf State of Nebraska: Hepatitis C Prevention & Strategic Plan]</ref>

During chemotherapy treatments, medical professionals access multi-dose bags of saline to flush patient ports.  Outbreaks occur as a result of doctors and nurses reusing syringes, contaminating the saline bag with the blood of multiple patients.

Tom McKnight – Evelyn’s husband – is a local [[family practice]] physician who helped uncover the outbreak when some of his patients were found to have hepatitis C. Travis Bennington is a local attorney who represented 19 of the 99 Nebraska patients in their malpractice claims.<ref>[http://75.126.152.5/~hardtime/HONOR/staff.html HONOReform - Founders and Staff]</ref>

HONOReform was founded in 2007 using settlement funds Evelyn McKnight secured in her [[malpractice]] trial.  HONOReform was established to advocate  patient justice, safety, and compassion by promoting the lessons learned from hepatitis outbreaks.<ref name="HONOReform - About Us"/><ref name="online.wsj.com">[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123371129728046131.html#articleTabs%3Darticle Wall Street Journal - Lax Needle Use Raises Alarm, February 4, 2009]</ref>

==Mission & Activities==
Since its formation, HONOReform advocates have lobbied the [[U.S. Congress]] and federal health agencies for greater oversight of private physician offices and other stand-alone healthcare facilities.  HONOReform  has fought to raise awareness to widely accepted healthcare standards that call for using syringes and similar products once.<ref name="cbsnews.com"/>

In addition to its federal advocacy efforts, HONOReform leaders have helped other communities recover from similar outbreaks.  Following the [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] tragedy, Evelyn McKnight testified before the [[Nevada Legislature]]’s Legislative Committee on Health Care and also took part in numerous community healing and education events.<ref>[http://www.lvrj.com/news/16936876.html Las Vegas Review-Journal: 'Message of hope' on hepatitis, March 23, 2008]</ref><ref>[http://www.lvrj.com/news/16976731.html Las Vegas Review-Journal:  Patients vent emotions, March 25, 2008]</ref>

===The One and Only Campaign===
On February 11, the Safe Injection Practices Coalition — composed of patient advocacy organizations, foundations, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), including Dr. Richard Besser, Acting Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Acting Administrator, provider associations and societies and industry partners — joined Congresswoman [[Shelley Berkley]] (D-NV) and [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] (D-NV) to launch the One & Only Campaign, an education and awareness initiative aimed at both healthcare providers and patients.<ref>[http://75.126.152.5/~hardtime/OneandOnly/news_events.html One and Only Campaign - News and Events]</ref>

The campaign will utilize a number of training materials to eliminate knowledge gaps concerning injection safety among providers and empower patients to ask their healthcare providers the correct questions to keep them safe. The campaign is initially being piloted in Nevada.<ref name="online.wsj.com"/><ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090205/ap_on_he_me/med_hepatitis_syringes Associated Press - Campaign warns against reusing plastic syringes, February 5, 2009]</ref>

Coalition partners for the One and Only Campaign include: CDC Foundation, HONOReform Foundation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), [[Becton, Dickinson and Company]] (BD), [[American Association of Nurse Anesthetists]] (AANA), [[Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology]] (APIC), [[Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care]] (AAAHC), [[Nevada State Medical Association]], [[Nebraska Medical Association]], and the [[Ambulatory Surgery Foundation]].<ref>[http://75.126.152.5/~hardtime/OneandOnly/coalitionmembers.html One and Only Campaign - Coalition Members]</ref>

==Other notable outbreaks==
===Las Vegas, Nevada===
In February 2008, the largest patient notification of its kind occurred when 40,000 patients of the [[Endoscopy Center of Southern Nevada]] in Las Vegas were urged to be tested for hepatitis and HIV.<ref>(Las Vegas Review Journal, February 28, 2008)</ref>  Subsequently, an additional 10,000 patients of the center along with 13,000 patients at the Desert Shadow Endoscopy Center were advised to be tested. To date, a total of 114 confirmed cases of hepatitis C have been linked to the outbreaks.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,443878,00.html FOXNews: 114 Hepatitis Cases Traced to 2 Las Vegas Medical Clinics, October 24, 2008]</ref>

===Grand Rapids, Michigan===
More than 16,000 patients of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] [[dermatologist]] Dr. Robert W. Stokes were issued letters urging them to be tested for hepatitis, HIV and other diseases.  Dr. Stokes was accused of reusing on patients syringes and sutures intended for one-time use in one patient.  Stokes is currently in federal prison, serving a 10-and-a-half-year sentence for insurance fraud, and has had his medical license revoked.  Patients impacted by the outbreak pushed  for  a number of reforms including greater  penalties for such actions and a measure that would prohibit or severely limit the reuse of medical devices.<ref>This resulted in Governor Jennifer Granholm signing Public Act 25, effective 3/26/10, making reuse of single use medical devices a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years or a fine of not more than $50,000.00, or both.
