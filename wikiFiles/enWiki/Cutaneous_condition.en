== Where cutaneous conditions occur ==
{{Main|Integumentary system}}

The skin weighs an average of {{convert|4|kg|lb}}, covers an area of {{convert|2|m2|sqft}}, and is made of three distinct layers: the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], [[dermis]], and [[subcutaneous tissue]].<ref name="Lookingbill" />  There are two main types of human skin: [[glabrous skin]], the nonhairy skin on the palms and soles (also referred to as the "palmoplantar" surfaces), and hair-bearing skin.<ref name="RooksCD">Burns, Tony; ''et al.''

=== Epidermis ===
{{Main|Epidermis (skin)}}

The epidermis is the most superficial layer of skin, a [[epithelium|squamous epithelium]] with several [[stratum|strata]]: the [[stratum corneum]], [[stratum lucidum]], [[stratum granulosum]], [[stratum spinosum]], and [[stratum germinativum|stratum basale]].<ref name="Fitz" />  Nourishment is provided to these layers via [[diffusion]] from the dermis, since the epidermis is without direct blood supply.  The epidermis contains four cell types: [[keratinocyte]]s, [[melanocyte]]s, [[Langerhans cell]]s, and [[Merkel cell]]s. Of these, keratinocytes are the major component, constituting roughly 95 percent of the epidermis.<ref name="RooksCD" />  This stratified squamous epithelium is maintained by cell division within the stratum basale, in which differentiating cells slowly displace outwards through the stratum spinosum to the stratum corneum, where cells are continually shed from the surface.<ref name="RooksCD" />  In normal skin, the rate of production equals the rate of loss; it takes about two weeks for a cell to migrate from the basal cell layer to the top of the granular cell layer, and an additional two weeks to cross the stratum corneum.<ref name="bolognia">{{cite book |author=Bolognia, Jean L.; ''et al.'' |title=Dermatology |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

=== Dermis ===
{{Main|Dermis}}

The dermis is the layer of skin between the epidermis and subcutaneous tissue, and comprises two sections, the [[papillary dermis]] and the [[reticular dermis]].<ref name="Rapini">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P. |title=Practical dermatopathology |publisher=Elsevier Mosby |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-323-01198-5 |oclc= |accessdate=}}</ref>  The superficial papillary dermis [[wiktionary:interdigitate|interdigitates]] with the overlying [[rete ridge]]s of the epidermis, between which the two layers interact through the basement membrane zone.<ref name="Rapini" />  Structural components of the dermis are [[collagen]], [[elastic fiber]]s, and extrafibrillar matrix (previously called [[ground substance]]).<ref name="Rapini" />  Within these components are the pilosebaceous units, arrector pili muscles, and the [[eccrine gland|eccrine]] and [[apocrine gland]]s.<ref name="Fitz" />  The dermis contains two vascular networks that run parallel to the skin surface—one superficial and one deep plexus—which are connected by vertical communicating vessels.<ref name="Fitz" /><ref name="Grant-Kels">{{cite book |author=Grant-Kels JM |title=Color Atlas of Dermatopathology (Dermatology: Clinical & Basic Science) |publisher=Informa Healthcare |location= |year=2007 |pages= [http://books.google.ca/books?id=v2L21vtvm0MC&pg=PT163 163] | isbn=0-8493-3794-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  The function of blood vessels within the dermis is fourfold: to supply nutrition, to regulate temperature, to modulate inflammation, and to participate in wound healing.<ref name="LAG">{{cite book |last=Ryan |first=T |chapter=Cutaneous Circulation |editor-last=Goldsmith |editor-first=Lowell A |title=Physiology, biochemistry, and molecular biology of the skin |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |edition=2nd |year=1991 |page=1019 |isbn=0-19-505612-4 }}</ref><ref name="pmid8423379">{{cite journal |author=Swerlick RA, Lawley TJ |title=Role of microvascular endothelial cells in inflammation |journal=J.

=== Subcutaneous tissue ===
{{Main|Subcutaneous tissue}}

The subcutaneous tissue is a layer of fat between the dermis and underlying [[fascia]].<ref name="Lynch">{{cite book |author=Lynch, Peter J. |title=Dermatology |publisher=Williams & Wilkins |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-683-05252-7 |oclc= |accessdate=}}</ref>  This tissue may be further divided into two components, the actual fatty layer, or [[panniculus adiposus]], and a deeper vestigial layer of muscle, the [[panniculus carnosus]].<ref name="RooksCD" />  The main cellular component of this tissue is the [[adipocyte]], or fat cell.<ref name="Lynch" />  The structure of this tissue is composed of septal (i.e. linear strands) and [[Lobe (anatomy)|lobular]] compartments, which differ in microscopic appearance.<ref name="Fitz" />  Functionally, the subcutaneous fat insulates the body, absorbs trauma, and serves as a reserve energy source.<ref name="Lynch" />

== Diseases of the skin ==
{{for|a comprehensive list|List of cutaneous conditions}}
Diseases of the skin include [[skin infection]]s and [[skin neoplasm]]s (including [[skin cancer]]).

== History ==
In 1572, [[Geronimo Mercuriali]] of [[Forlì]], [[Italy]], completed ''De morbis cutaneis'' (translated "On the diseases of the skin"). It is considered the first scientific work dedicated to dermatology. <!-- This text needs no citation as it is a reference unto itself. -->

== Approach to diagnoses ==
The physical examination of the skin and its appendages, as well as the mucous membranes, forms the cornerstone of an accurate diagnosis of cutaneous conditions.<ref name="isbn0-7216-8256-1">{{cite book |author=Callen, Jeffrey |title=Color atlas of dermatology |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-8256-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Most of these conditions present with cutaneous surface changes termed "lesions," which have more or less distinct characteristics.<ref name="Andrews" />  Often proper examination will lead the physician to obtain appropriate historical information and/or laboratory tests that are able to confirm the diagnosis.<ref name="isbn0-7216-8256-1" />  Upon examination, the important clinical observations are the (1) morphology, (2) configuration, and (3) distribution of the lesion(s).<ref name="isbn0-7216-8256-1" />  With regard to morphology, the initial lesion that characterizes a condition is known as the "primary lesion," and identification of such a lesions is the most important aspect of the cutaneous examination.<ref name="Andrews" />  Over time, these primary lesions may continue to develop or be modified by regression or trauma, producing "secondary lesions."<ref name="Lookingbill" />  However, with that being stated, the lack of standardization of basic dermatologic terminology has been one of the principal barriers to successful communication among physicians in describing cutaneous findings.<ref name="Fitz">{{cite book |author=Wolff, Klaus Dieter; ''et al.'' |title=Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location= |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-07-146690-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Nevertheless, there are some commonly accepted terms used to describe the macroscopic morphology, configuration, and distribution of skin lesions, which are listed below.<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; ''et al.'' |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

"Configuration" refers to how lesions are locally grouped ("organized"), which contrasts with how they are distributed (see next section).
{{colbegin|3}}
* '''Agminate''' - in clusters
* '''Annular''' or '''circinate''' - ring-shaped
* '''Arciform''' or '''arcuate''' - arc-shaped
* '''Digitate''' - with finger-like projections
* '''Discoid''' or  '''nummular''' - round or disc-shaped
* '''Figurate''' - with a particular shape
* '''Guttate''' - resembling drops

* '''Stellate''' - star-shaped
* '''Targetoid''' - resembling a [[bullseye (target)|bullseye]]
* '''Verrucous''' - wart-like
{{colend}}

==== Distribution ====
"Distribution" refers to how lesions are localized. They may be confined to a single area (a patch) or may exist in several places. Some distributions correlate with the means by which a given area becomes affected.  For example, contact dermatitis correlates with locations where allergen has elicited an allergic immune response. [[Varicella zoster virus]] is known to recur (after its initial presentation as [[chicken pox]]) as [[herpes zoster]] ("shingles"). Chicken pox appears nearly everywhere on the body, but herpes zoster tends to follow one or two dermatomes; for example, the eruptions may appear along the bra line, on either or both sides of the patient.

* '''Symmetric''' - one side mirrors the other
* '''Flexural''' - on the front of the fingers
* '''Extensor''' - on the back of the fingers
* '''[[Intertriginous]]''' - in an area where two skin areas may touch or rub together
* '''[[Morbilliform]]''' - resembling [[measles]]
* '''Palmoplantar''' - on the palm of the hand or bottom of the foot
* '''Periorificial''' - around an orifice such as the mouth
