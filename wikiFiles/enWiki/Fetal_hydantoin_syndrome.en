'''Fetal hydantoin syndrome''', also called '''fetal dilantin syndrome''' is a group of defects caused to the developing fetus by exposure to the teratogenic effects of [[phenytoin]] or [[carbamazepine]]. Dilantin is the [[brand name]] of the drug phenytoin sodium in the [[United States]], commonly used in the treatment of [[epilepsy]]. 

It may also be called '''congenital hydantoin syndrome''',<ref name="pmid18479711">{{cite journal |author=Nicolai J, Vles JS, Aldenkamp AP |title=Neurodevelopmental delay in children exposed to antiepileptic drugs in utero: a critical review directed at structural study-bias |journal=J.

==Prevalence and presentation==
About one third of children whose mothers are taking this drug during pregnancy typically have [[Small for gestational age|intrauterine growth restriction]] with [[microcephaly]] and develop minor dysmorphic craniofacial features and limb defects including hypoplastic nails and distal phalanges ([[birth defects]]).  A smaller population will have growth problems and [[developmental delay]], or [[mental retardation]].  Rare side effects include methemoglobinemia.
