'''Wheat allergy''' is a rare allergy which typically presents itself as a [[food allergy]], but can also be a [[contact allergy]] resulting from occupational exposure to [[wheat]]. Like all allergies, wheat allergy involves [[immunoglobulin E]] and [[mast cell]] response.  Typically the allergy is limited to the seed storage proteins of wheat, some reactions are restricted to wheat proteins, while others can react across many varieties of seeds and other plant tissues. Wheat allergy may be a misnomer since there are many allergenic components in wheat, for example [[serine protease]] inhibitors, [[glutelin]]s and [[prolamin]]s and different responses are often attributed to different proteins. Twenty-seven potential wheat [[allergen]]s have been successfully identified.<ref>Sotkovský P, Sklenář J, Halada P, Cinová J, Setinová I, Kainarová A, Goliáš J, Pavlásková K, Honzová S, Tučková L.,"A new approach to the isolation and characterization of wheat flour allergens.",  ''Clin Exp Allergy.'' 2011 Jul;41(7):1031-43 </ref> The most severe response is exercise/aspirin induced [[anaphylaxis]] attributed to one omega [[gliadin]] that is a relative of the protein that causes [[celiac disease]].<ref name="pmid17655322">{{cite journal |author=Akagawa M, Handoyo T, Ishii T, Kumazawa S, Morita N, Suyama K |title=Proteomic analysis of wheat flour allergens |journal=J.

==Types of allergens==
Wheat allergy is rare.  Prevalence in adults was found to be 0.21% in a 2012 study in Japan.{{CN|date=April 2013}}  <!--The blood test used in that study, which is for IgE antibodies to omega-5-gliadin, was the subject of a 2008 study{{cite pmid|18925890}} But I need more than the abstract.  TBD...--> There are four major classes of seed storage proteins: [[albumin]]s, [[globulin]]s, prolamins and glutelins. Within wheat, [[prolamin]]s are called [[gliadin]]s and [[glutelin]]s are called [[glutenin]]s. These two protein groups form the classic glutens. While gluten is also the causative agent of [[coeliac disease]] (CD), coeliac disease can be contrasted to gluten allergy by the involvement of different immune cells and antibody types (See [[Gluten_sensitivity#Comparative_pathophysiology|Comparative pathophysiology of gluten sensitivities]]), and because the list of allergens extend beyond the classic gluten category of proteins.

===Gluten allergy===
====Prolamin allergies====
[[Prolamin]]s and the closely related glutelins, a recent{{when|date=June 2012}} study in Japan found that glutenins are a more frequent allergen, however gliadins are associated with the most severe disease.{{fact|date=June 2012}}  A proteomics based study found a γ-gliadin isoform gene.<ref name="pmid17655322"/>

====Glutelin allergies====
Glutenin (wheat glutelin) is a predominant allergen in wheat.<ref name="pmid17655322"/> Nine subunits of [[Triticeae glutens#Chemical_behavior|LMW-glutinen]] have been linked in connection with wheat allergies.

===Albumin and globulin allergy===

====Derivative allergies====
[[Protein]]s are made of a chain of dehydrated amino acids. When enzymes cut proteins into pieces they add water back to the site at which they cut, called enzymatic hydrolysis, for proteins it is called proteolysis.  
The initial products of this [[hydrolysis]] are polypeptides, and smaller products are called simply peptides; these are called ''wheat protein hydrolysates''. These hydrolysates can create allergens out of wheat proteins that previously did not exist by the exposure of buried antigenic sites in the proteins. 

When proteins are cut into polypeptides, buried regions are exposed to the surface, and these buried regions may possibly be antigenic. Such hydrolyzed wheat protein is used as an additive in foods and [[cosmetics]]. The peptides are often 1 kD in size (9 amino acid residues in length) and may increase the allergic response.<ref name="pmid16534217">{{cite journal | author = Akiyama H | title = Profile analysis and immunoglobulin E reactivity of wheat protein hydrolysates | journal = Int.

==Signs and symptoms==
Wheat allergies are not altogether different from other food allergies or respiratory allergies. However two conditions, [[exercise-induced anaphylaxis|exercise/aspirin induced anaphylaxis]] and [[urticaria]] occur more frequently with wheat allergies. 

Common symptoms of a wheat allergy include [[sacroiliitis]], [[eczema]] ([[atopic dermatitis]]), [[urticaria|hives (urticaria)]], [[asthma]], [[hay fever|"Hay fever" (allergic rhinitis)]], [[angioedema]] (tissue swelling due to fluid leakage from blood vessels), abdominal cramps, [[nausea]], and [[vomiting]].<ref name=Wheat_Allergy_ASSA>{{cite web |url=http://www.allergysa.org/wheat.htm |title=Allergy Society of South Africa - Wheat Allergy |accessdate=2008-10-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080424072330/http://www.allergysa.org/wheat.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-24}}</ref> Rarer symptoms include {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic shock]], [[arthritis]], bloated stomach, chest pains, [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or [[mood swings]], [[diarrhea]], [[dizziness]], [[headache]], joint and muscle aches and pains (may be associated with progressive arthritis), [[palpitation]]s, [[psoriasis]], [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS), swollen throat or tongue, tiredness and lethargy, and unexplained cough.

Reactions may become more severe with repeated exposure.

===Asthma, anaphylaxis, nasal allergies===
====Exercise-induced anaphylaxis====
Wheat gliadins and potentially oat avenins are associated with another disease, known as wheat-dependent [[exercise-induced anaphylaxis|exercise induced anaphylaxis]] (WDEIA) which is similar to Baker's allergy as both are mediated by IgE responses.<ref name=Bakers_EIA_compare>{{cite journal | author = Mittag D, Niggemann B, Sander I, Reese I, Fiedler EM, Worm M, Vieths S, Reese G. | title = Immunoglobulin E-reactivity of wheat-allergic subjects (baker's asthma, food allergy, wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis) to wheat protein fractions with different solubility and digestibility | journal = Mol Nutr Food Res. | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | pages = 380–389 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15672478 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.200400016}}</ref> In WDEIA, however, the ω-gliadins<ref name=EIA_w_gliadin>{{cite journal | author = Matsuo H, Morita E, Tatham AS, Morimoto K, Horikawa T, Osuna H, Ikezawa Z, Kaneko S, Kohno K, and Dekio S. | title = Identification of the IgE-binding epitope in omega-5 gliadin, a major allergen in wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis | journal = J Biol Chem. | volume = 279 | issue = 13 | pages = 12135–12140 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14699123 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M311340200}}</ref> or a high molecular weight glutenin subunit, and similar proteins in other ''Triticeae'' genera enter the blood stream during exercise where they cause acute asthmatic or allergic reaction.<ref name=EIA_Aspirin>{{cite journal | author = Matsuo H, Morimoto K, Akaki T, Kaneko S, Kusatake K, Kuroda T, Niihara H, Hide M, and Morita E. | title = Exercise and aspirin increase levels of circulating gliadin peptides in patients with wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis | journal = Clin Exp Allergy. | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 461–466 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15836754 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2005.02213.x}}</ref>  One recent study of ω-gliadins demonstrated these gliadins are more similar to the bulk of oat avenins than α/β or γ gliadins but, so far, oat avenins have not been linked to WDEIA.

The Gli-B1 gene in wheat, ''[[Triticum aestivum]]'' comes from one of three progenitor species, ''[[Aegilops speltoides]]'', indicating that nascent mutations on the B genome of wheat or  from a small number of cultivated [[triticeae]] species.<ref name="pmid17263477">{{cite journal | author = Denery-Papini S | title = Influence of the allelic variants encoded at the Gli-B1 locus, responsible for a major allergen of wheat, on IgE reactivity for patients suffering from food allergy to wheat | journal = J.

====Aspirin sensitivity and wheat allergy====
Recent study of WDEIA shows that both aspirin and exercise increase the presence of gliadin in the blood stream<ref name="pmid17507204">{{cite journal |author=Morita E, Kunie K, Matsuo H |title=Food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis |journal=J.

Wheat allergies were also common with contact dermatitis. A primary cause was the [[donning agent]] used for [[latex]] gloves prior to the 1990s, however most gloves now use protein free starch as donning agents.

===Autoimmune (rheumatoid) arthritis ===
There appears to be an association of autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis (ARA) both with GSE and gluten allergies.<ref name="pmid16484508">{{cite journal | author = Hvatum M, Kanerud L, Hällgren R, Brandtzaeg P | title = The gut–joint axis: cross reactive food antibodies in rheumatoid arthritis | journal = Gut | volume = 55 | issue = 9 | pages = 1240–7 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16484508 | doi = 10.1136/gut.2005.076901 | pmc = 1860040}}</ref> ARA in GSE/CD may be secondary to tTG autoimmunity.

===Neuropathies===
'''Migraines'''. In the late 70s it was reported that people with [[migraines]] had reactions to food allergens, like ARA, the most common reaction was to wheat (78%), orange, eggs, tea, coffee, chocolate, milk, beef, corn, cane sugar, and yeast. When 10 foods causing the most reactions were removed migraines fell precipitously, hypertension declined.<ref name="pmid87628">{{cite journal | author = Grant EC | title = Food allergies and migraine | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 8123 | pages = 966–9 | year = 1979 | pmid = 87628 | doi =10.1016/S0140-6736(79)91735-5 }}</ref> Some specific instances are attributed to wheat.<ref name="pmid16362649">{{cite journal | author = Pascual J, Leno C | title = A woman with daily headaches | journal = The journal of headache and pain : official journal of the Italian Society for the Study of Headaches | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 91–2 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16362649 | doi = 10.1007/s10194-005-0158-1}}</ref>

'''Autism'''. Parents of children with [[autism]] often ascribe the children's gastrointestinal symptoms to allergies to wheat and other foods. The published data on this approach are sparse, with the only double-blind study reporting negative results.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Elder JH |title= The gluten-free, casein-free diet in autism: an overview with clinical implications |journal= Nutr Clin Pract |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=583–8 |year=2008 |pmid=19033217 |doi=10.1177/0884533608326061}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Diagnoses of wheat allergy may deserve special consideration.  Omega-5 gliadin, the most potent wheat allergen, cannot be detected in whole wheat preparations, it must be extracted and partially digested (similar to how it degrades in the intestine) to reach full activity. Other studies show that digestion of wheat proteins to about 10 amino acids can increase the allergic response 10 fold. Certain allergy tests may not be suitable to detect all wheat allergies, resulting in cryptic allergies.  Because many of the symptoms associated with wheat allergies, such as [[sacroiliitis]], [[eczema]] and [[asthma]], may be related or unrelated to a wheat allergy, medical deduction can be an effective way of determining the cause. If symptoms are alleviated by [[immunosuppressant]] drugs, such as Prednisone, an allergy related cause is likely.  If multiple symptoms associated with wheat allergies are present in the absence of immunosuppressants then a wheat allergy is probable.<ref name=EIA_w_gliadin/>

==Treatment==
{{see also|Gluten-free diet}}
Wheat allergies differ from gluten-diet exclusion in that some types of allergens do not create species crossreactive responses, an individual may be able to consume [[barley]] and [[rye]] safely, although more than likely they will be allergic to other wheat such as spelt and Kamut. Wheat is often a cryptic contaminant of many foods; more obvious items are bread crumbs, [[maltodextrin]], [[bran]], cereal extract, [[couscous]], cracker meal, [[enriched flour]], [[gluten]], high-gluten flour, high-protein flour, [[wheat gluten (food)|seitan]], [[semolina]] wheat, vital gluten, wheat bran, wheat germ, wheat gluten, wheat malt, wheat starch or [[whole wheat flour]]. Less obvious sources of wheat could be [[gelatinized starch]], [[hydrolyzed vegetable protein]], modified food starch, [[modified starch]], natural flavoring, [[soy sauce]], soy bean paste, hoisin sauce, starch, [[natural gum|vegetable gum]], specifically [[Beta-glucan]], vegetable starch.
People with wheat allergy who are [[gluten sensitivity|gluten sensitive]] may also need to avoid related [[cereal]]s, [[rye]] and [[barley]], which have similar glutinous proteins.

===Alternative cereals===
[[Triticeae glutens|Triticeae gluten]]-free oats (free of wheat, rye or barley) may be a useful source of cereal fiber. Some wheat allergies allow the use of rye bread as a substitute. [[Rice flour]] is a commonly used alternative for those allergic to wheat.  Wheat-free [[millet]] flour, [[buckwheat]], [[flax seed]] meal, [[corn meal]], [[quinoa]] flour, [[chia seed]] flour, [[tapioca]] starch or flour, and others can be used as substitutes.
