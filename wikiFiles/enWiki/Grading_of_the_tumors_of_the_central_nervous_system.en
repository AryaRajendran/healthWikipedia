The concept of '''grading of the tumors of the central nervous system''', agreeing for such the regulation of the "progressiveness" of these neoplasias (from benign and localized tumors to malignant and infiltrating tumors), dates back to 1926 and was introduced by P. Bailey and H. Cushing,<ref>

in the elaboration of what turned out the first systematic classification of gliomas.<ref>

In the following, the grading systems present in the current literature are introduced. Then, thru a table, the more relevant are compared.

==ICD-O scale==
[[Image:405518-FIBRILLARY OR DIFFUSE ASTROCYTIC NEOPLASM.jpg|thumb|238px|[[MRI]] of a '''diffuse astrocytoma''' with differing degrees of differentiation.]]
The first edition of the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD) dates back to 1893, the current review ([[ICD-10]]) dates 1994.
<br />
In 1976 the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) publishes the first edition of the [[International Classification of Diseases for Oncology]] (ICD-O), now at the third edition (ICD-O-3, 2000).
<br />
In this last edition, the Arabic numeral after the character "/" indicates the "behavior" of the neoplasia, with the following meaning:<ref>Vicari P (2007).<br/>

Reggio Emilia dicembre 2007. Accessed on 2009-08-12.</ref>

*/0 benign neoplasia
*/1 uncertain neoplasia (benign or malignant)
*/2 neoplasia ''[[in situ]]''
*/3 primary infiltrative malignant neoplasia
*/6 secondary malignant neoplasia
*/9 malignant neoplasia, uncertain if primitive or secondary

<br />
For the concepts of ''benign'' and ''malignant'' neoplasia see [[Tumor]] and [[Cancer]].
For ''primary'' and ''secondary'' neoplasias see [[Metastasis]]. <br>
A brain tumor composed of benign cells, but located in a vital area (as the brain is), can be considered to be life-threatening — although the tumor and its cells would not be classified as malignant.

==Kernohan grading==
[[Image:Glioblastoma macro.jpg|thumb|238px|Macroscopic pathology of '''glioblastoma'''.]]
The Kernohan grading system<ref name=CDC /><ref>
Kernohan JW, Mabon RF, Svien HJ, Adson AW (1949).<br/>
''A Semplified classification of gliomas.''<br/>
Proc. Staff: Meet. Mayo Clin. 24: 71-75.</ref> 
defines progressive malignancy of astrocytomas as follows: 

*'''Grade 1''' tumors are benign astrocytomas.
*'''Grade 2''' tumors are low-grade astrocytomas.
*'''Grade 3''' tumors are anaplastic astrocytomas.
*'''Grade 4''' tumors are glioblastomas.

==St Anne-Mayo grading==
[[Image:Anaplastic astrocytoma.jpg|thumb|238px|[[MRI]] of a patient with '''anaplastic  astrocytoma'''.]]
The St Anne-Mayo grading system<ref name=CDC /><ref>

''Correlates of survival and the Daumas-Duport grading system for astrocytomas.''</br>
J Neurosurg 74: 27-37.</ref> 
also is used to grade astrocytomas; however, this system uses four morphologic criteria to assign a grade:

a) ''nuclear'' ''[[atypia]]'',<br> 
b) ''[[mitosis]]'',<br> 
c) ''endothelial [[cell growth|proliferation]]''-'piled-up' endothelial cells. NOT hypervascularity

d) ''[[necrosis]]''.

<br />
The St. Anne-Mayo grade has four categories of tumors:
*'''Grade 1''' tumors do not meet any of the criteria.
*'''Grade 2''' tumors meet one criterion, usually nuclear atypia.
*'''Grade 3''' tumors meet two criteria, usually nuclear atypia and mitosis.
*'''Grade 4''' tumors meet three or four of the criteria.

==WHO grading==
[[Image:Pilocytic Micro.jpg|thumb|238px|'''Pilocytic astrocytoma'''. Nuclear hyperchromasia and pleomorphism are common. Note the typical cellular elongation, and, at the center of the illustration, the eosinophilic granular body that populates pilocytic astrocytomas and certain other slowly growing gliomas.]]

is contained in the volume ''Histological Typing of Tumours of the Central Nervous System'', whose first edition dates back to 1979, the second to 1993 and last one to 2007.
The WHO grade has four categories of tumors:

*'''Grade I''' tumors are slow-growing, nonmalignant, and associated with long-term survival.
*'''Grade II''' tumors are relatively slow-growing but sometimes recur as higher grade tumors. They can be nonmalignant or malignant.
*'''Grade III''' tumors are malignant and often recur as higher grade tumors.
*'''Grade IV''' tumors reproduce rapidly and are very aggressive malignant tumors.

<br />
From the histological point of view the WHO system is based on the same criteria as the St Anne-Mayo system.<ref>
