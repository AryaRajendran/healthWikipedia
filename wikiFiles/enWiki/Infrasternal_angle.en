The [[lower opening of the thorax]] is formed by the twelfth thoracic vertebra behind, by the eleventh and twelfth ribs at the sides, and in front by the cartilages of the tenth, ninth, eighth, and seventh ribs, which ascend on either side and form an angle, the '''infrasternal angle''' or '''subcostal angle''', into the apex of which the [[xiphoid process]] projects. 

[[Pregnancy]] causes the angle to increase from 68° to 103°.<ref name="pmid11316633">{{cite journal |author=Campbell LA, Klocke RA |title=Implications for the pregnant patient |journal=Am. J. Respir.
