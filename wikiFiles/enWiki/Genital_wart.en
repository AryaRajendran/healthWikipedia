'''Genital warts''' (or '''[[Condylomata]] acuminata''', '''venereal warts''', '''anal warts''' and '''anogenital warts''') are symptoms of a highly contagious [[sexually transmitted disease]] caused by some sub-types of [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV). It is spread through direct skin-to-skin contact during [[oral sex|oral]], [[genital]], or [[anal sex]] with an infected partner. [[Wart]]s are the most easily recognized symptom of genital HPV infection, and types 6 and 11 are responsible for 90% of genital warts cases.<ref name=NCI>{{cite web|last=US National Cancer Institute|title=HPV and Cancer|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/HPV|accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref>

Although 90% of those who contract HPV will not develop genital warts, those infected can still transmit the virus.<ref name=CDC-STD>{{cite web|last=US Centers for Disease Control|title=Genital HPV Infection - Fact Sheet|url=http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv.htm|accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref> Some types of HPV can cause [[cervical cancer]] and [[anal cancer]]s, but these are not the same types of HPV that cause genital warts.<ref name=CDC-STD/> However, it is possible to be infected with different varieties of HPV, such as a low-risk HPV that causes warts and a high-risk HPV that may cause cancer, either concurrently or at different times.<ref name=AAFP-2010>{{cite journal|last=Juckett|first=G|coauthors=Hartman-Adams, H|title=Human papillomavirus: clinical manifestations and prevention.|journal=American family physician|date=2010 Nov 15|volume=82|issue=10|pages=1209–13|pmid=21121531}}</ref> HPV is so common that more than half of all sexually active people will get it at some point in their lives.<ref name=CDC-STD />

==Signs and symptoms==
Genital warts often occur in clusters and can be very tiny or can spread into large masses in the genital or penis area. In other cases they look like small stalks. In women they occur on the outside and inside of the [[vagina]], on the opening ([[cervix]]) to the womb ([[uterus]]), or around (or inside) the [[anus]]. They are approximately as prevalent in men but the symptoms may be less obvious. When present, they usually are seen on the tip of the [[penis]]. They also may be found on the shaft of the penis, on the [[scrotum]], or around (or inside) the [[anus]]. Rarely, genital warts also can develop in the mouth or throat of a person who has had oral sex with an infected person.<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|last=Genkins|first=Gill|title=Genital warts|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/physical_health/sexual_health/stis_warts.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref> 

The viral particles are able to penetrate the skin and mucosal surfaces through microscopic abrasions in the genital area, which occur during sexual activity. Although 90% of HPV infections are cleared by the body within two years of infection, it is possible for infected cells to undergo a latency (quiet) period, with the first occurrence or a recurrence of symptoms happening months or years later.<ref name=AAFP-2010/>

Having sex with a partner whose HPV infection is latent and demonstrates no outward symptoms still leaves one vulnerable to becoming infected. If an individual has unprotected sex with an infected partner, there is a 70% chance that he or she will also become infected. The [[immune system]] eventually clears the virus through [[interleukin]]s, which recruit [[interferon]]s, which slow viral replication.<ref name=ModernManagement/>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Anal condyloma (3).jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of a genital wart with the characteristic changes ([[parakeratosis]], [[koilocyte]]s, papillomatosis). [[H&E stain]].]]
<!-- ===Histological=== -->
Genital warts, [[histopathology|histopathologically]], characteristically rise above the skin surface due to enlargement of the [[dermal papillae]], have [[parakeratosis]] and the characteristic nuclear changes typical of [[HPV]] infections (nuclear enlargement with perinuclear clearing).
<!-- ===Clinical==

DNA tests are available for diagnosis of high-risk HPV infections. Because genital warts are caused by low-risk HPV types, DNA tests cannot be used for diagnosis of genital warts or other low-risk HPV infections.<ref name=AAFP-2010/>

==Prevention==
{{See also| HPV vaccine}}

[[Gardasil]] (sold by [[Merck & Co.]]) is a [[vaccine]] that protects against [[human papillomavirus]] types 16, 18, 6, and 11. Types 6 and 11 cause genital warts, while 16 and 18 cause [[cervical cancer]].  The vaccine is preventive, not therapeutic, and must be given before exposure to the virus type to be effective, ideally before the beginning of sexual activity. The vaccine is approved by the [[United States|US]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] for use in both males and females as early as 9 years of age.<ref name=FDA-Gardasil>{{cite web|last=United States Food and Drug Administration|title=Gardasil|url=http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/UCM094042|work=Approved Products|accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref>

In the UK, Gardasil replaced [[Cervarix]] in September 2012<ref name=UK-DH-policy>{{cite web|last=UK Department of Health|title=Your guide to the HPV vaccination from September 2012|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_133345|accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> for reasons unrelated to safety.<ref name=MHRA-safety>{{cite web|last=UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|title=Human papillomavirus vaccine Cervarix: safety review shows balance of risks and benefits remains clearly positive|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/DrugSafetyUpdate/CON207191|accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> Cervarix had been used routinely in young females from its introduction in 2008, but was only effective against HPV types 16 and 18, neither of which typically causes warts.

==Management==
There is no cure for HPV, but there are methods to treat visible warts, which could reduce infectivity, although there are no trials studying the effectiveness of removing visible warts in reducing transmission.<ref name=FamilyManagement/> Every year, Americans spend $200 million on the treatment of genital warts.<ref name="PPAA">{{cite news|title=STI Awareness: Genital Warts|url=http://blog.advocatesaz.org/2012/04/18/sti-awareness-genital-warts/|accessdate=2012-04-20|newspaper=Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona|date=2012-04-18}}</ref>  Genital warts may disappear without treatment, but sometimes eventually develop a fleshy, small raised growth. There is no way to predict whether they will grow or disappear. Warts can sometimes be identified because they show up as white when [[acetic acid]] is applied, but this method is not recommended on the vulva because microtrauma and inflammation can also show up as acetowhite.<ref name=ModernManagement/> Magnifying glasses or colposcope may also be used to aid in identifying small warts.<ref name=ModernManagement/>

Depending on the sizes and locations of warts (as well as other factors), a doctor will offer one of several ways to treat them. Podofilox is the first-line treatment due to its low cost.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fox PA, Tung MY |title=Human papillomavirus: burden of illness and treatment cost considerations |journal=Am J Clin Dermatol |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages= 365–381 |year=2005 |pmid=16343025 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Almost all treatments can potentially cause depigmentation or scarring.<ref name=FamilyManagement>{{cite journal |author=Kodner CM, Nasraty S |title=Management of genital warts |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=70 |issue=12 |pages= 2335–2342 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15617297 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20041215/2335.html}}</ref>
* A 0.15% – 0.5% [[podophyllotoxin]] (also called podofilox) solution in a gel or cream. Marketed as Condylox (0.5%),  Wartec (0.15%) and Warticon (0.15%),<ref name=AbandonPodophyllin/> it can be applied by the patient to the affected area and is not washed off. It is the purified and standardized active ingredient of the podophyllin (see below). Podofilox is safer and more effective than podophyllin.<ref name=AbandonPodophyllin/> Skin erosion and pain are more commonly reported than with imiquimod and sinecatechins.<ref name=GreenTea/> Its use is cycled (2 times per day for 3 days then 4–7 days off); one review states that it should only be used for four cycles.<ref name=OpenAccess2006/>
* [[Imiquimod]] (Aldara) is a topical immune response cream, applied to the affected area. It causes less local irritation than podofilox but may cause fungal infections (11% in package insert) and flu-like symptoms (less than 5% disclosed in package insert).<ref name=GreenTea/>
*[[Sinecatechins]] (marketed as Veregen and Polyphenon E) is an ointment of catechins (55% [[epigallocatechin gallate]]<ref name=ModernManagement/>) extracted from [[green tea]] and other components. Mode of action is undetermined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2007/021902s002lbl.pdf|format=PDF|title=Veregen label information|accessdate=2013-01-01}}</ref> It appears to have higher clearance rates than podophyllotoxin and imiquimod and causes less local irritation, but clearance takes longer than with imiquimod.<ref name=GreenTea>{{cite journal |author=Meltzer SM, Monk BJ, Tewari KS |title=Green tea catechins for treatment of external genital warts |journal=Am.

* [[Liquid nitrogen]] [[cryosurgery]] is safe for pregnancy. It kills warts 71–79% of the time, but recurrence is 38% to 73% 6 months after treatment.<ref name=ModernManagement/> Local infections have been reported.<ref name=ModernManagement/>
* [[Trichloroacetic acid]] (TCA) is less effective than [[cryosurgery]],<ref name=OpenAccess2006/> and is not recommended for use in the vagina, cervix, or urinary meatus.<ref name=ModernManagement/>
* Surgical excision is best for large warts, and has a greater risk of scarring.<ref name=FamilyManagement/>
* Laser [[ablation]] does not seem to be any more effective than other physician-applied methods,<ref name=CurrentManagement>{{cite journal |author=O'Mahony C |title=Genital warts: current and future management options |journal=Am J Clin Dermatol |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages= 239–243 |year=2005 |pmid=16060711 |doi= |url=}}</ref> but is often used as a last resort and is extremely expensive.<ref name=ModernManagement/>
* A 20% [[podophyllin]] anti-[[mitosis|mitotic]] solution, applied to the affected area and later washed off. However, this crude herbal extract is not recommended for use on vagina, urethra, perianal area, or cervix,<ref name=ModernManagement/> and must be applied by a physician.<ref name=AbandonPodophyllin>{{cite journal |author=von Krogh G, Longstaff E |title=Podophyllin office therapy against condyloma should be abandoned |journal=Sex Transm Infect |volume=77 |issue=6 |pages= 409–412 |year=2001 |month=December |pmid=11714936 |pmc=1744412 |doi=10.1136/sti.77.6.409  |url=http://sti.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/77/6/409}}</ref> Reported reactions include nausea, vomiting, fever, confusion, coma, renal failure, ileus, and leukopenia; death has been reported with extensive topical application, or application on mucous membranes.<ref name=ModernManagement/>
* [[Interferon]] can be used; it is effective, but it is also expensive and its effect is inconsistent.<ref name=OpenAccess2006/>
* [[Electrocauterization]] can be used; it is an older procedure but recovery time is generally longer. In severe cases of genital warts, treatment may require general or spinal anesthesia. This is a surgical procedure. More effective than [[cryosurgery]] and recurrence is at a much lower rate.
* Oral  [[Isotretinoin]] is a therapy that has proven effective in experimental use, but is rarely used due to potentially severe side effects. In a small-scale study, low dose oral isotretinoin showed considerable efficacy and may represent an alternative systemic form of therapy for Genital Warts. Yet, albeit this indicative evidence not many studies have been conducted to further confirm the findings. In most countries this therapy is currently unapproved and only used as an alternative therapy if other therapies failed.<ref name=UnapprovedIsotretinoin>{{cite journal |author=Virendra N. Sehgal MD, Govind Srivastava MD, Kabir Sardana MD |title=Isotretinoin – unapproved indications/uses and dosage: a physician's reference |journal=International Journal of Dermatology |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages= 772–777 |year=2006 |month=May |doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2006.02830.x |url= |pmid=16796650}}</ref>
;Discontinued:
* A 5% 5-[[fluorouracil]] (5-FU) cream was used, but it is no longer considered an acceptable treatment due to the side-effects.<ref name=ModernManagement>{{cite journal |author=Mayeaux EJ, Dunton C |title=Modern management of external genital warts |journal=J Low Genit Tract Dis |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages= 185–192 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18596459 |doi=10.1097/LGT.0b013e31815dd4b4 |url=}}</ref>

Podophyllin, podofilox and [[Isotretinoin]] should not be used during [[pregnancy]], as they could cause [[birth defect]]s in the [[fetus]].

==Epidemiology==

Genital HPV infections have an estimated prevalence in the US of 10–20% and clinical manifestations in 1% of the sexually active adult population.<ref name=OpenAccess2006/> US incidence of HPV infection has increased between 1975 and 2006.<ref name=OpenAccess2006/>  About 80% of those infected are between the ages of 17–33.<ref name=OpenAccess2006/> Although treatments can remove the warts, they do not remove the HPV, so warts can recur after treatment (about 50–73% of the time<ref name=CDC2004>CDC. (2004). [http://www.cdc.gov/std/HPV/2004HPV%20report.pdf REPORT TO CONGRESS: Prevention of Genital Human Papillomavirus Infection].</ref>). Warts can  also spontaneously regress (with or without treatment).<ref name=OpenAccess2006/> 

Traditional theories postulated that the virus remained in the body for a lifetime. However, studies using sensitive DNA techniques have shown that through immunological response the virus can either be cleared or suppressed to levels below what [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) tests can measure. One study testing genital skin for subclinical HPV using PCR found a prevalence of 10%.<ref name=OpenAccess2006>{{cite journal |author=Scheinfeld N, Lehman DS |title=An evidence-based review of medical and surgical treatments of genital warts |journal=Dermatol.
