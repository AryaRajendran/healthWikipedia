An '''antimicrobial''' is an agent that kills [[microorganism]]s or inhibits their growth.<ref name="urlAntimicrobial - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary">{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Antimicrobial |title=Antimicrobial - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-05-02| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090424210931/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antimicrobial| archivedate= 24 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Antimicrobial medicines can be grouped according to the microorganisms they act primarily against. For example, antibacterials (commonly known as antibiotics) are used against [[bacteria]] and antifungals are used against [[fungi]]. They can also be classed according to their function. Antimicrobials that kill microbes are called ''microbicidal''; those that merely inhibit their growth are called ''microbiostatic''. [[Disinfectant]]s such as [[bleach]] are ''non-selective antimicrobials''.

Use of substances with antimicrobial properties is known to have been common practice for at least 2000 years. [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|Ancient Egyptians]] and [[Ancient Greek medicine|ancient Greeks]] used specific [[mold]]s and plant extracts to treat infection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=M. Wainwright|title=Moulds in ancient and more recent medicine |journal=Mycologist |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=21–23. |year=1989 |doi=  10.1016/S0269-915X(89)80010-2|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269915X89800102}}</ref> More recently, microbiologists such as [[Louis Pasteur]] and Jules Francois Joubert observed antagonism between some bacteria and discussed the merits of controlling these interactions in medicine.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kingston W |title=Irish contributions to the origins of antibiotics |journal=Irish journal of medical science |volume=177 |issue=2 |pages=87–92 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18347757 |doi=10.1007/s11845-008-0139-x |url=}}</ref> In 1928, [[Alexander Fleming]] became the first to discover a natural antimicrobial fungus known as [[penicillium rubens]]. He named the substance extracted from the fungus [[penicillin]] and in 1942 it was successfully used to treat a [[streptococcus]] infection. <ref>http://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/09/us/anne-miller-90-first-patient-who-was-saved-by-penicillin.html</ref> Penicillin also proved successful in the treatment of many other infectious diseases such as [[gonorrhea]], [[strep throat]] and [[pneumonia]], which were potentially fatal to patients up until then.

Today, numerous antimicrobial agents exist to treat a wide range of infections.

=== Antibacterials ===
[[Image:Selman Waksman NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Prof. [[Selman Waksman|Waksman]], who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for developing 22 antibiotics&mdash;most notably [[Streptomycin]].]]
[[Antibacterials]] or antibiotics are used to treat bacterial [[infections]].  The [[toxicity]] to humans and other animals from antibiotics is generally considered low.  However, prolonged use of certain antibiotics can decrease the number of [[gut flora]], which may have a negative impact on health.  Some recommend that during or after prolonged antibiotic use one should consume [[probiotics]] and eat reasonably to replace destroyed gut flora.

The term antibiotic originally described only those formulations derived from living organisms but is now also applied to [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] antimicrobials, such as the [[sulphonamide (medicine)|sulphonamide]]s.

The discovery, development and clinical use of antibiotics during the 20th century has substantially reduced mortality from bacterial infections.  The antibiotic era began with the pneumatic application of [[nitroglycerine]] drugs, followed by a “golden” period of discovery from about 1945 to 1970, when a number of structurally diverse and highly effective agents were discovered and developed.  However since 1980 the introduction of new antimicrobial agents for clinical use has declined, in part because of the enormous expense of developing and testing new drugs.  Paralleled to this there has been an alarming increase in [[antibiotic resistance|bacterial resistance]] to existing agents.<ref>Levy SB (ed) (1994) Drug Resistance: The New Apocalypse (special issue) ''Trends Microbiol'' 2: 341–425</ref>

Antibiotics are among the most commonly used drugs.  For example 30% or more patients admitted to hospital are treated with one or more courses of antibiotics .{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} However antibiotics are also among the drugs commonly misused by physicians, e.g. usage of antibiotic agents in viral [[respiratory tract infection]]s.  The inevitable consequence of widespread and injudicious use of antibiotics has been the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, resulting in a serious threat to global public health.  The resistance problem demands that a renewed effort be made to seek antibacterial agents effective against pathogenic bacteria resistant to current antibiotics.  Possible strategies towards this objective include increased sampling from diverse environments and application of [[metagenomics]] to identify bioactive compounds produced by currently unknown and uncultured microorganisms as well as the development of small-molecule libraries customized for bacterial targets.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19843/ Challenges for the Development of New Antimicrobials — Rethinking the Approaches] Bookshelf ID: NBK19843</ref>

=== Antifungals ===
{{main|Fungicide}}

Antifungals are used to kill or prevent further growth of [[fungi]]. In medicine, they are used as a treatment for infections such as [[athlete's foot]], [[ringworm]] and [[candidiasis|thrush]] and work by exploiting differences between mammalian and fungal cells. They kill off the fungal organism without dangerous effects on the host. Unlike bacteria, both fungi and humans are [[eukaryote]]s. Thus, fungal and human [[cell (biology)|cell]]s are similar at the molecular level, making it more difficult to find a target for an antifungal drug to attack that does not also exist in the infected organism. Consequently, there are often [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] to some of these drugs.  Some of these side effects can be life-threatening if the drug is not used properly.

As well as their use in medicine, antifungals are frequently sought after to [[Mold growth, assessment, and remediation|treat mold growth]] in damp or wet home materials. Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking soda) blasted on to surfaces acts as an antifuingal. Another popular, professional antifungal (Serum) is often applied after or without blasting by soda and is a mix of Hydrogen Peroxide and a thin surface coating that neutralizes mold and encapsulates the surface to prevent spore release. Some paints are also manufactured with an added antifungal agent for use in high humidity areas such as bathrooms or kitchens. Other antifungal surface treatments typically contain variants of metals known to suppress mold growth e.g. pigments or solutions containing copper, silver or zinc. These solutions are not usually available to the general public because of their toxicity.

===Antivirals===
{{main|Antiviral drug}}

Antiviral drugs are a class of medication used specifically for treating [[virus|viral]] infections.  Like antibiotics, specific antivirals are used for specific viruses.  They are relatively harmless to the host and therefore can be used to [[pharmacotherapy|treat]] infections.  They should be distinguished from [[viricide]]s, which actively deactivate virus particles outside the body.

Many of the antiviral drugs available are designed to treat infections by [[retroviruses]], mostly [[HIV]].  Important [[antiretroviral drug]]s include the class of [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]]s. [[Herpesviridae|Herpes viruses]], best known for causing [[cold sore]]s and genital herpes, are usually treated with the [[nucleoside analogue]] [[acyclovir]]. [[Viral hepatitis]] (A-E) are caused by five unrelated hepatotropic viruses and are also commonly treated with antiviral drugs depending on the type of infection. [[Influenzavirus A|influenza A]] and [[Influenzavirus B|B]] viruses are important targets for the development of new [[influenza treatment]]s to overcome the resistance to existing [[neuraminidase inhibitor]]s such as [[oseltamivir]].

Antiviral drugs work by inhibiting the virus before it enters the cell, stopping it from reproducing, or, in some cases, preventing it from leaving the cell. However, like antibiotics, viruses may evolve to resist the antiviral drug.

===Antiparasitics===
{{Expand section|date=November 2007}}
{{main|Antiparasitic}}

Antiparasitics are a class of medications indicated for the treatment of infection by [[parasitism|parasites]], such as [[nematodes]], [[cestode]]s, [[trematode]]s, infectious [[protozoa]], and [[amoeba]]e.  Like antifungals, they must kill the infecting pest without serious damage to the host.

===Non-pharmaceutical===

A wide range of [[chemical]] and [[natural]] compounds are used as antimicrobials. [[Organic acids]] are used widely as antimicrobials in food products, e.g. [[lactic acid]], [[citric acid]], [[acetic acid]], and their salts, either as ingredients, or as disinfectants.  For example, beef carcasses often are sprayed with acids, and then rinsed or steamed, to reduce the prevalence of ''[[E. coli]]''.

Traditional healers long have used plants to prevent or cure infectious disease. Many of these plants have been investigated scientifically for antimicrobial activity, and a large number of plant products have been shown to inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms. A number of these agents appear to have structures and modes of action that are distinct from those of the antibiotics in current use, suggesting that [[cross-resistance]] with agents already in use may be minimal. So, it is worthwhile to study plants and plant products for activity against resistant bacteria.

{{Main|Antimicrobial properties of copper|Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces}}

Copper-alloy surfaces have natural intrinsic antimicrobial properties and can kill microorganisms such as  ''E. coli'' , [[MRSA]] and ''[[Staphylococcus]]''.<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_properties_of_copper</ref><ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_copper_touch_surfaces</ref><ref>[http://coppertouchsurfaces.org/antimicrobial/bacteria/index.html Copper Touch Surfaces]</ref> The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has approved the registration of 355 such [[Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces|antibacterial copper alloys]]. As a public hygienic measure in addition to regular cleaning, antimicrobial copper alloys are being installed in healthcare facilities and in subway transit systems.<ref>http://www.rail.co/2011/07/22/chilean-subway-protected-with-antimicrobial-copper</ref><ref>http://construpages.com.ve/nl/noticia_nl.php?id_noticia=3032&language=en</ref><ref>http://www.antimicrobialcopper.com/media/149689/pr811-chilean-subway-installs-antimicrobial-copper.pdf</ref> Other heavy metal cations such as Hg<sup>2+</sup> and Pb<sup>2+</sup> have antimicrobial activities, but can be toxic to other living organisms such as humans.

==== Essential oils ====

Many [[essential oil]]s included in [[pharmacopoeia]]s supposedly possess antimicrobial activity, including:

==Physical==

===Heat===
{{Main|Dry heat sterilization|Moist heat sterilization}}

Both dry and moist heat are effective in eliminating microbial life. For example, jars used to store preserves such as [[Fruit preserves|jam]] can be sterilized by heating them in a [[conventional oven]]. Heat is also used in [[pasteurization]], a method for slowing the spoilage of foods such as milk, cheese, juices, wines and vinegar. Such products are heated to a certain temperature for a set period of time, which greatly reduces the number of harmful microorganisms.

===Radiation===
Foods are often [[Food irradiation|irradiated]] to kill harmful [[Food-borne_illness#Causes|pathogens]].<ref>http://www.epa.gov/radiation/sources/food_irrad.html</ref> Common sources of radiation used in food sterilization include [[cobalt-60]] (a [[gamma emitter]]), [[electron beams]] and [[x-rays]]. [[Ultraviolet#Biology_related_uses|Ultraviolet light]] is also used as an antimicrobial in air and water purification systems, aquarium and pond maintenance, laboratories and food sterilization.<ref>http://www.ehow.co.uk/how-does_5188035_uv-light-kill-bacteria_.html</ref>
