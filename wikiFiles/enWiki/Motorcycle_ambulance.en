'''Motorcycle ambulances''' are a type of [[emergency vehicle]] which either carries a solo [[paramedic]] or [[Certified first responder|first responder]] to a patient; or is used with a [[motorcycle trailer|trailer]] or [[sidecar]] for transporting patients. A motorcycle ambulance is able to respond to a [[medical emergency]] much faster than a car or van in heavy traffic,<ref>{{Citation |title=Responding!

Motorcycle ambulances were used during [[World War I]] by the British, French and Americans.  At the time the advantages of light weight, speed, and mobility over larger vehicles was cited as the motive for the use of sidedcar rigs in this role. The US version had two stretchers arranged one on top of the other.<ref>{{Citation |title=Outing: sport, adventure, travel, fiction, |volume=69 |first1=Caspar |last1=Whitney |first2=Albert |last2=Britt |date=October 1916-March 1917 |publisher=Outing Publishing Company |page=490 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cA0LAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA490 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Hopkins |first=Albert |year=1915 |title=The Scientific American war book: the mechanism and technique of warfare |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GdQqAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA101 |pages=101–102 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |editor-last=Windsor |editor-first=H.H. |title=Motorcycle Ambulance Has New Features |magazine=Popular mechanics magazine |volume=30 |publisher=[[Popular Mechanics]] |year=1918 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M61IAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA165 |page=165 }}</ref> The French ambulance used a sidecar that held a single patient, who could either lie down or sit up.<ref>{{Citation |unused_data=ISSN 0161-7370 |magazine=The Popular Science |volume=93 |issue=2 |date=August 1918 |title=Chauffeur and Nurse, Too, is the Ambulance Driver |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=migDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA166 }}</ref>

Since 2000, the [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] Fire Department has operated Honda motorcycle ambulances ({{lang-pt|Motos Operacionais de Bombeiros}}, known as "MOBs") in a first responder role, to offset the influence of traffic on the response times of traditional ambulances. The motorcycles carry a variety of emergency care equipment (including basic [[extrication]], [[technical rescue]], and firefighting gear) and are always deployed in two-man teams, with the lead vehicle carrying a first aid kit and intravenous fluids and the rear vehicle carrying more advanced equipment, including an [[automated external defibrillator]], suction devices, and emergency delivery kits.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/SaoPaulo/0,,MUL164806-5605,00.html |title=Caos no trânsito muda trabalho dos bombeiros |date=October 31, 2007 |work=G1 |publisher=[[Globo.com]] |language=Portuguese |accessdate=2009-11-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Azevedo |first=Laner |url=http://www.motonline.com.br/colunistas/seguranca-legislacao/bombeiros-25ago08.html |title=193, o número da vida |date=August 25, 2008 |publisher=Motonline |accessdate=2009-11-13}}</ref>

===Germany===
The Bavarian Red Cross has operated motorcycle ambulances since 1983. As of 2011 they report a fleet of 25 motorcycles and 100 volunteer paramedics.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.brk.de/gemeinschaften/bereitschaften/fachdienste/motorradstreife/was-wir-tun/who-we-are|title=Who we are|publisher=Bavarian Red Cross (BRK)|accessdate=2011-12-23}}</ref>

===Hong Kong===
[[File:HKFSD EMA Motorcycles for 2009 Model.jpeg|thumb|Honda ST1300P in Hong Kong.]]

According to the book ''Rescue Mission'' which is written by an Emergency Medical Assistant of [[Hong Kong Fire Services Department]], the H.K.F.S.D. established the first motorcycle programme in 1982.<ref>{{cite book|title=Rescue Mission|ISBN=978-988-17-1746-7|page=173}}</ref> At first, there are only two motorcycles stationed in Morrison Hill Ambulance Depot. In 1986, the H.K.F.S.D. found that motorcycles are useful for responding medical calls, so they bought seven more motorcycles in 1987. In 1989, the motorcycle team had 15 motorcycles and stationed in several ambulance depots. Today, the H.K.F.S.D. has 35 motorcycles.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.gov.hk/en/about/abouthk/factsheets/docs/fire_services.pdf|title=Fire services factsheet|publisher=Hong Kong Government}}</ref>

[[Auxiliary Medical Service]], another government-owned service, also has motorcycles.

===Japan===

[[File:Ota-kyumei.jpg|thumb|right|A "Lifesaving Rider" motorcycle of Ota City Fire Department, [[Gunma Prefecture]]]]

In some areas of Japan. Japanese fire departments use off-road motorcycles as emergency vehicles. They are useful for negotiating the small streets and heavy traffic in the large urban areas of Japanese cities. Having off-road motorcycles helps in responding to the mountain hills that are around a lot of cities. Some departments would likely have their crews in teams of two or three motorcycles. One of the motorcycles carries a [[first aid kit]] and/or automated external defibrillator. The other motorcycles in this team may carry fire fighting and rescue equipment. Most crews are firefighters with training in [[Certified first responder|first responder]], [[First Aid]], and/or [[paramedic]]. Each crew member wears a light weight fire suit and a fire fighting motorcycle helmet. A lot of these motorcycles have their own radio, cargo bays, lights and sirens.

===Kenya===
As part of the United Kingdom's [[Department for International Development]] (DFID) wider £50 million country programme (2009), they are putting in place among other things a new motorcycle ambulance service. The Magunga's Health Centre now operates a motorcycle (sidecar) ambulance service.<ref>{{citation |title= Improving Kenya's maternal care |year= 2008 |work=newspaper |publisher= The Guardian |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/gallery/2009/mar/19/maternal-health-kenya?picture=344815748 |accessdate=2009-11-03 | location=London | date=2009-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{citation |title= Motorbikes and Midwives: Delivering Better Care for Kenya's Mums (press release) |date=8 May 2008 |work=Mobility and Health |publisher=International Forum for Rural Transport and Development (IFRTD) |url=http://ifrtd.gn.apc.org/mobilityandhealth/news/full.php?view=421 |accessdate=2009-11-03 }}</ref>

Sarah Brown, Global Patron of the [[White Ribbon Alliance for Safe Motherhood]] said:

{{cquote| This is yet another great example of Britain leading the way in saving mothers’ lives. For a long time the world has known what needs to be done to reduce the numbers of women dying in pregnancy and childbirth and yet the same numbers of women continue to die. The key to changing the survival chances of mothers and infants is better investment in health services that vulnerable women can reach. DFID’s aid money makes a massive difference because it means countries can invest in facilities and health workers and simple but vital things like motorbike ambulances which can often mean the difference between life or death for women who live a long way from a clinic.<ref>{{citation |title= Motorbikes and Midwives: Delivering better care for Kenya's mums |date=17 March 2009 |work=[[Department for International Development]] (DFID) |url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Media-Room/News-Stories/2009/Motorbikes-and-Midwives-Delivering-better-care-for-Kenyas-mums1/ |accessdate=2010-04-04}}</ref>}}

===Malawi===
They have been used in remote rural areas in Malawi<ref>{{citation |title= Malawi launches Road Map to prevent women from dying while giving life |date=30 March 2007 |work=Office of the UN Resident Coordinator Malawi |url=http://www.unmalawi.org/new_site/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=213:malawi-launches-road-map-to-prevent-women-from-dying-while-giving-life&catid=40:latest-press-release&Itemid=132 |accessdate=2009-11-1- }}</ref><ref>{{citation |title= Motorcycle ambulances in Malawi reduce maternal mortality |date=10 Dec 2007 |work=Mobility and Health |publisher=International Forum for Rural Transport and Development (IFRTD) |url=http://www.ifrtd.gn.apc.org/new/news/full.php?view=242 |accessdate=2009-11-03 }}</ref> as a means to improve access to [[obstetrics|obstetric]] health care facilities for women in labor or needing prenatal care. Lightweight [[Enduro motorcycle|off-road motorcycles]], equipped with a sidecar holding a stretcher for the patient, have been found to be an efficient supplement, but not replacement for, 4-wheel drive SUV ambulances. Purchase prices and operating costs have been found to be a fraction of a four-wheeled vehicle, and the sidecar rigs have been found to be less likely to be misused by diverting them for non-healthcare purposes.  The lighter sidecar rigs are better able to cope with poor roads and areas that become impassible to heavier cars and trucks during the rainy season. Disadvantages include the reluctance of drivers to travel at night in some cases, and the inability to carry more than one patient at a time.

The report concluded that: 
{{cquote|Motorcycle ambulances reduce the delay in referring women with obstetric complications from remote rural health centers to the district hospital, particularly under circumstances where health centers have no access to other transport or means of communication to call for an ambulance. They are also a relatively cheap and effective option for referral of patients in developing countries, particularly in rural areas with little or no public transport. Nineteen motorcycle ambulances can be bought for the price of one Toyota land cruiser car ambulance. Operating costs compare in a similar way. Motorcycle ambulances also potentially help reduce costs for women and their families to access EmOC, although this was not the subject of this study.<ref>{{Citation |title=Motorcycle ambulances for referral of obstetric emergencies in rural Malawi: Do they reduce delay and what do they cost? |first1=Jan J. |last1=Hofman |first2=Chris |last2= Dzimadzi |first3= Kingsley |last3= Lungu | first4=Esther Y. |last4=Ratsma |first5= Julia |last5=Hussein |year= 2008 |journal=International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics |volume=102 |issue=2 |pages=191–197 |publisher= International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics |doi= 10.1016/j.ijgo.2008.04.001|url=http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0020-7292/PIIS0020729208001550.pdf |format=pdf}}</ref>}}
