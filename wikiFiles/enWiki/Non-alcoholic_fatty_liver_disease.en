'''Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease''' ('''NAFLD''') is one cause of a [[fatty liver]], occurring when fat is deposited ([[steatosis]]) in the [[liver]] not due to [[alcoholism|excessive alcohol use]]. It is related to [[insulin resistance]] and the [[metabolic syndrome]] and may respond to treatments originally developed for other insulin-resistant states (e.g. [[diabetes mellitus type 2]]) such as weight loss, [[metformin]] and [[thiazolidinedione]]s.<ref name=Adams>{{cite journal|author=Adams LA, Angulo P|title=Treatment of non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease|journal=Postgrad Med J|year=2006|volume=82|pages=315–22|pmid=16679470|doi=10.1136/pgmj.2005.042200|url=http://pmj.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/82/967/315|issue=967|pmc=2563793}}</ref> [[Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis]] ('''NASH''') is the most extreme form of NAFLD, and is regarded as a major cause of [[cirrhosis]] of the liver of unknown cause.<ref name=Clark>{{cite journal|author=Clark JM, Diehl AM|title=Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: an underrecognized cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis|journal=JAMA|year=2003|volume=289|pages=3000–4|pmid=12799409|doi=10.1001/jama.289.22.3000|issue=22}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Most patients with NAFLD have few or no symptoms. Patients may complain of fatigue, [[malaise]], and dull right-upper-quadrant [[abdominal pain|abdominal discomfort]]. Mild [[jaundice]] may be noticed although this is rare. More commonly NAFLD is diagnosed following abnormal [[liver function tests]] during routine blood tests. By definition, [[alcohol]] consumption of over 20 g/day (about 25 ml/day) excludes the condition.<ref name=Adams/>

NAFLD is associated with [[insulin resistance]] and [[metabolic syndrome]] ([[obesity]], [[combined hyperlipidemia]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes mellitus (type II)]] and [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]).<ref name=Adams/><ref name=Clark/>

==Causes==
NAFLD can also be caused by some medications:<ref name=Adams/>
* [[Amiodarone]]
* [[Antiviral drug]]s ([[nucleoside analogue]]s)
* [[Aspirin]] rarely as part of [[Reye's syndrome]] in children
* [[Corticosteroid]]s
* [[Methotrexate]]
* [[Tamoxifen]]
* [[Tetracycline]]

===Soft drinks===
[[Soft drink]]s have been linked to NAFLD through the presence of [[high fructose corn syrup]] which may cause increased deposition of fat in the [[abdomen]]<ref name=renamed_from_20518077_on_20120506222623>{{cite pmid|20518077}}</ref> although the consumption of [[sucrose]] shows a similar effect (likely due to its breakdown into [[fructose]]).<ref name=Allocca>{{cite book|first=M|last=Allocca|coauthors=Selmi C|year=2010|chapter=Emerging nutritional treatments for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease|title=Nutrition, diet therapy, and the liver|pages=[http://books.google.ca/books?id=ahWoeI4-Y34C&pg=PA131#v=onepage&q&f=false 131–146]|isbn=1420085492|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|editors=Preedy VR; Lakshman R; Rajaskanthan RS}}</ref>

===Genetics===
Indian men have a high [[prevalence]] of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Two genetic mutations for this susceptibility have been identified, and these mutations provided clues to the mechanism of NASH and related diseases.

[[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphisms]] (genetic variations) in the [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) T455C and C482T in [[APOC3]] are associated with fatty liver disease, [[insulin resistance]], and possibly [[hypertriglyceridemia]]. 95 healthy Asian Indian men and 163 healthy non-Asian Indian men around New Haven, Connecticut were genotyped for polymorphisms in those SNPs. 20% homogeneous wild both loci. Carriers of T-455C, C-482T, or both (not additive) had a 30% increase in fasting plasma apolipoprotein C3, 60% increase in fasting plasma triglyceride and [[retinal]] [[fatty acid ester]], and 46% reduction in plasma triglyceride clearance. Prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was 38% in carriers, 0% wild (normal). Subjects with fatty liver disease had marked insulin resistance.<ref name=Petersen2010>{{cite journal|author=Petersen KF, Dufour S, Hariri A, ''et al.''|title=Apolipoprotein C3 Gene Variants in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease|journal=N. Engl. J. Med.|volume=362|issue=12|pages=1082–9|year=2010|pmid=20335584|pmc=2976042|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0907295}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
NAFLD is considered to cover a spectrum of disease activity. This spectrum begins as fatty accumulation in the liver (hepatic [[steatosis]]). A liver can remain fatty without disturbing liver function, but by varying mechanisms and possible insults to the liver may also progress to become NASH, a state in which steatosis is combined with [[inflammation]] and [[fibrosis]]. NASH is a progressive disease: over a 10 year period, up to 20% of patients with NASH will develop [[cirrhosis]] of the liver, and 10% will suffer death related to liver disease.<ref name=McCulough>{{cite journal|last=McCulough|first=Arthur J|title=The clinical features, diagnosis and natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease|journal=Clinics in Liver Disease|year=2004|month=Aug|volume=8|issue=3|pages=521-33|doi=10.1016/j.cld.2004.04.004|pmid=15331061|accessdate=7 April 2013}}</ref> Cigarette smoking is not associated with an increased risk of developing NASH.

The exact cause of NAFLD is still unknown. However, both [[obesity]] and [[insulin resistance]] probably play a strong role in the disease process. The exact reasons and mechanisms by which the disease progresses from one stage to the next are not known.

One debated mechanism proposes a "second hit", or further injury, enough to cause change that leads from hepatic steatosis to [[hepatic]] inflammation. [[Oxidative stress]], hormonal imbalances, and [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] abnormalities are potential causes for this "second hit" [[phenomenon]].<ref name=Adams/>

==Diagnosis==
Common findings are elevated [[liver enzyme]]s and a liver [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] showing [[steatosis]]. An ultrasound may also be used to exclude [[gallstone]] problems ([[cholelithiasis]]). A [[liver biopsy]] (tissue examination) is the only test widely accepted as definitively distinguishing NASH from other forms of liver disease and can be used to assess the severity of the [[inflammation]] and resultant [[fibrosis]].<ref name=Adams/>

Non-invasive diagnostic tests have been developed, such as [[FibroTest]], that estimates liver fibrosis,<ref name="pmid18973844">{{cite journal|author=Halfon P, Munteanu M, Poynard T|title=FibroTest-ActiTest as a non-invasive marker of liver ﬁbrosis|journal=Gastroenterol Clin Biol|volume=32|issue=6|pages=22–39|year=2008|pmid=18973844|doi=10.1016/S0399-8320(08)73991-5}}</ref> and [[SteatoTest]], that estimates steatosis,<ref name="pmid16503961">{{cite journal|author=Ratziu et al|title=Diagnostic value of biochemical markers (FibroTest-FibroSURE) for the prediction of liver fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease|journal=BMC Gastroenterology|volume=6|pages=6|year=2006|pmid=16503961|last2=Massard|first2=J|last3=Charlotte|first3=F|last4=Messous|first4=D|last5=Imbert-Bismut|first5=F|last6=Bonyhay|first6=L|last7=Tahiri|first7=M|last8=Munteanu|first8=M|last9=Thabut|first9=D|doi=10.1186/1471-230X-6-6|pmc=1386692}}</ref> however their use has not been widely adopted.<ref name="Chalasani">{{cite journal|author=Vuppalanchi R, Chalasani N|title=Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: Selected practical issues in their evaluation and management|journal=Hepatology|volume=49|pages=306–317|year=2009|pmid=19065650|doi=10.1002/hep.22603|issue=1|pmc=2766096}}</ref> Apoptosis has been indicated as a potential mechanism of hepatocyte injury as caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18 ([[M30-Apoptosense ELISA]]) in serum/plasma is often elevated in patients with NASH; however, as the role of oncotic necrosis has yet to be examined it is unknown to what degree apoptosis acts as the predominant form of injury.<ref name=Feldstein2009>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/hep.23050|author=Feldstein AE ''et al.''|title=Cytokeratin-18 fragment levels as noninvasive biomarker for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: A multicenter validation study|journal=Hepatology|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1072–8|year=2009|pmid=19585618|pmc=2757511}}</ref><ref name=Musso2010>{{cite journal|author=Musso G ''et al.''|title=Meta-analysis: Natural history of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive tests for liver disease severity|journal=Ann Med.|pages=1–33|year=2010|pmid=21039302|doi=10.3109/07853890.2010.518623|volume=43|issue=8}}</ref>

Other diagnostic tests are available. Relevant blood tests include [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]], [[glucose]], [[human serum albumin|albumin]], and [[renal function]]. Because the liver is important for making proteins used in [[coagulation]] some coagulation related studies are often carried out especially the INR (international normalized ratio). Blood tests ([[serology]]) are usually used to rule out viral [[hepatitis]] (hepatitis A, B, C and [[herpes]] viruses like [[Epstein-Barr virus|EBV]] or [[CMV]]), [[rubella]], and autoimmune related diseases. [[Hypothyroidism]] is more prevalent in NASH patients which would be detected by determining the [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]].<ref name=Liangpunsakul2003>{{cite journal|author=Liangpunsakul S, Chalasani N|title=Is hypothyroidism a risk factor for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis?|journal=J Clin Gastroenterol|year=2003|volume=37|pages=340–3|pmid=14506393|doi=10.1097/00004836-200310000-00014|issue=4}}</ref>

It has been suggested that in cases involving overweight patients whose blood tests do not improve on losing weight and exercising that a further search of other underlying causes be undertaken. This would also apply to those with fatty liver who are very young or not overweight or insulin-resistant. In addition those whose physical appearance indicates the possibility of a congenital syndrome, have a family history of liver disease, have abnormalities in other organs, and those that present with moderate to advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.<ref name="pmid18192446">{{cite journal|author=Cassiman D, Jaeken J|title=NASH may be trash|journal=Gut|volume=57|issue=2|pages=141–4|year=2008|pmid=18192446|doi=10.1136/gut.2007.123240|url=}}</ref>

==Management==
A large number of treatments for NAFLD have been studied. While many appear to improve biochemical markers such as [[alanine transaminase]] levels, most have not been shown to reverse [[histological]] abnormalities or reduce clinical endpoints:<ref name=Adams/>

The primary outcome was an improvement in certain histological features as measured by biopsy—but it did not improve fibrosis.
