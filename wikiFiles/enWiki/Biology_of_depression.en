Scientific studies have found that numerous brain areas show altered activity in patients suffering from [[depression (mood)|depression]], and this has encouraged advocates of various theories that seek to identify a biochemical origin of the disease, as opposed to theories that emphasize psychological or situational causes. Among the theories of a biologically based cause of depression are those involving genetics and circadian rhythms, but the most prominent and widely researched is the monoamine hypothesis.

== Genetic factors ==
In 2003 ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' published an influential<ref>{{cite pmid|19890228}}</ref> study of [[Avshalom Caspi]] et al. who found that a [[gene-environment interaction]] (GxE) may explain why life stress is a predictor for depressive episodes in some individuals, but not in others, depending on an allelic variation of the serotonin-transporter-linked promoter region ([[5-HTTLPR]]).<ref>{{cite doi|10.1126/science.1083968}}</ref> Soon after, the results were replicated by [[Kenneth Kendler]]'s group, raising hopes in the [[psychiatric genetics]] community.<ref>{{cite pmid|15867106}}</ref><ref>http://www.esi-topics.com/nhp/2006/september-06-KennethSKendler.html</ref> By 2007 there were 11 replications, 3 partial replication and 3 non-replications of this proposed GxE. However, two of the largest studies<ref>{{cite doi|10.1017/S0033291704002727}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.07.014}}</ref> were negative.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/sj.mp.4002067}}</ref> Two 2009 [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] were also negative; one included 14 studies,<ref>{{cite doi|10.1001/jama.2009.878}}</ref> the other just five, owing to different study selection criteria.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.06.009}}</ref> A 2010 review of studies in this area found 17 replications, 8 partial replications (interaction only in females or only with one of several types of adversity), and 9 non-replications (no interaction or an interaction in the opposite direction). It also found a systematic relationship between the method used to assess environmental adversity and the results of the studies; all studies using objective indicators or structured interviews to assess stress replicated the gene–environment interaction fully or partially, whereas all non-replications relied on brief self-report measures of adversity. This review also found that both 2009 meta-analyses were significantly biased toward negative studies.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/mp.2009.123}}</ref>

Other hypothesized genomic influences are [[BDNF]] polymorphisms, but the replications studies have been mixed and insufficient as of 2005 for a meta-analysis.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.08.024}}</ref> Studies also indicate an association of BDNF to suicidal behavior.<ref name="pmid19721723">{{cite journal | author = Dwivedi Y | title = Brain-derived neurotrophic factor: role in depression and suicide | journal = Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 433–49 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19721723 | doi = 10.2147/NDT.S5700| url = | pmc = 2732010 }}</ref> However, findings from the gene-environment interactions studies suggest that the current BDNF models of depression are too simplistic.<ref name=nat08>{{cite doi|10.1038/nature07455}}</ref> A 2008 study found interactions (biological [[epistasis]]) in the signaling pathways of the BDNF and the [[serotonin transporter]]; the BDNF [[Val66Met]] allele, which was predicted to have reduced responsitivity to serotonin, was found to exercise protective effects in individuals with the short 5-HTTLPR allele that is otherwise believed to predispose individuals to depressive episodes after stressful events.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/mp.2008.32}}</ref> Thus, the BDNF-mediated signalling involved in neuroplastic responses to stress and antidepressants is influenced by other genetic and environmental modifiers.<ref name=nat08/>

==Circadian rhythm==
[[Image:Biological clock human.PNG|thumb|right|350px|Depression may be related to the same brain mechanisms that control the cycles of sleep and wakefulness.]] Depression may be related to abnormalities in the [[circadian rhythm]], or biological clock. For example, [[Rapid eye movement sleep|rapid eye movement (REM) sleep]]—the stage in which [[dream]]ing occurs—may be quick to arrive and intense in depressed people. REM sleep depends on decreased [[serotonin]] levels in the [[brain stem]],<ref name="pmid12531125"/> and is impaired by compounds, such as antidepressants, that increase serotonergic tone in brain stem structures.<ref name="pmid12531125"/> Overall, the serotonergic system is least active during sleep and most active during wakefulness. Prolonged wakefulness due to [[sleep deprivation]] activates serotonergic neurons, leading to processes similar to the therapeutic effect of antidepressants, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Depressed individuals can exhibit a significant lift in mood after a night of sleep deprivation. SSRIs may directly depend on the increase of central serotonergic neurotransmission for their therapeutic effect, the same system that impacts cycles of sleep and wakefulness.<ref name="pmid12531125">{{vcite journal |author=Adrien J. |title=Neurobiological bases for the relation between sleep and depression|journal=Sleep Medicine Review |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=341–51 |year=2003 |pmid=12531125}}</ref>

Research on the effects of [[light therapy]] on [[seasonal affective disorder]] suggests that light deprivation is related to decreased activity in the serotonergic system and to abnormalities in the sleep cycle, particularly insomnia. Exposure to light also targets the serotonergic system, providing more support for the important role this system may play in depression.<ref name="pmid17964200">{{vcite journal |author=Terman M |title=Evolving applications of light therapy|journal=Sleep Medicine Review |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=497–507 |year=2007 |pmid=17964200 |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2007.06.003}}</ref> Sleep deprivation and [[light therapy]] both target the same brain neurotransmitter system and brain areas as antidepressant drugs, and are now used clinically to treat depression.<ref name="pmid17689120">{{vcite journal |author=Benedetti F, Barbini B, Colombo C, Smeraldi E |title=Chronotherapeutics in a psychiatric ward|journal=Sleep Medicine Review |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=509–22 |year=2007 |pmid=17689120 |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2007.06.004}}</ref> Light therapy, sleep deprivation and sleep time displacement (sleep phase advance therapy) are being used in combination quickly to interrupt a deep depression in hospitalized patients.<ref name="pmid17964200"/>

==Fructose malabsorption==
A series of 50 subjects examined in an Australian study showed increased depressive scores on [[Beck Depression Inventory]] associated with reduced plasma [[tryptophan]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ledochowski M, Widner B, Murr C, Sperner-Unterweger B, Fuchs D |title=Fructose malabsorption is associated with decreased plasma tryptophan |journal=Scand.

===The role of serotonin===
Many variations on the monoamine hypothesis involve the neurotransmitter serotonin, regulated by the [[serotonin transporter]], which assists the modulation of things such as [[anxiety]], [[anger]], [[appetite]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[sleep]], mood, and several other things.  People with depression may have differences in [[serotonin transporter#Length variation in 5-HTTLPR|transporter gene length]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Research shows that people with both genes being the long form are less likely to become depressed while people with one short and one long or two short forms are more likely to develop depression.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The functions of serotonin are difficult to describe in a simple way.  In some circumstances serotonin seems to act as a signal of "repletion" or "satisfaction".  Thus, satiation after eating, and orgasm following sex, both produce release of serotonin.  In animals that have hierarchical social structures, dominant individuals show higher levels of serotonin metabolites than lower-status individuals.  In the brain, serotonin exerts a suppressive effect on both the [[reward system]] and punishment system{{Clarify|date=May 2010}}, and therefore is likely to reduce the intensity of motivation whether aversive or appetitive.

==Monoamine hypothesis==
[[Image:Synapse Illustration2 tweaked.svg|thumb|left|Illustration of the major elements in a prototypical [[synapse]]. Synapses are gaps between [[neuron|nerve cells]]. These cells convert their [[action potential|electrical impulses]] into bursts of chemical relayers, called [[neurotransmitter]]s, which travel across the synapses to [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] on adjacent cells, triggering electrical impulses to travel down the latter cells.]]
Many [[antidepressant]] drugs increase [[Chemical synapse|synaptic]] levels of the monoamine [[neurotransmitter]] [[serotonin]], but they may also enhance the levels of two other neurotransmitters, [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]]. The observation of this efficacy led to the monoamine hypothesis of depression, which postulates that the deficit of certain neurotransmitters is responsible for the corresponding features of depression: "Norepinephrine may be related to alertness and energy as well as anxiety, attention, and interest in life; [lack of] serotonin to anxiety, obsessions, and compulsions; and dopamine to attention, motivation, pleasure, and reward, as well as interest in life." The proponents of this hypothesis recommend choosing the antidepressant with the mechanism of action impacting the most prominent symptoms. Anxious or irritable patients should be treated with SSRIs or [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s, and the ones with the loss of energy and enjoyment of life—with norepinephrine and dopamine enhancing drugs.<ref name="pmid18494537">{{cite journal |author=Nutt DJ |title=Relationship of neurotransmitters to the symptoms of major depressive disorder |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=69 Suppl E1 |issue= |pages=4–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18494537}}</ref>
[[Image:Monoamine receptor effects.png|thumb|right|Monoamine receptors affect [[phospholipase C]] and [[adenylyl cyclase]] inside of the cell. Green arrows means stimulation and red arrows inhibition. Serotonin receptors are blue, norepinephrine orange, and dopamine yellow. Phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase start a [[Signal transduction|signaling cascade]] which turn on or off genes in the cell.

The 5HT-3 receptor is associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects and has no relationship to the other monoamine receptors. ]]
Consistent with the monoamine hypothesis, a [[longitudinal study]] uncovered a [[moderator variable|moderating effect]] of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene on stressful life events in predicting depression. Specifically, depression seems especially likely to follow stressful life events, but even more so for people with one or two short [[allele]]s of the 5-HTT gene.<ref name="Caspi">{{cite journal |author=Caspi A, ''et al.''. |title=Influence of life stress on depression: Moderation by a polymorphism in the 5-HTT gene |journal=Science |volume=301 |issue= 5631|pages=386–89 |year=2003|pmid=12869766 |doi=10.1126/science.1083968 |bibcode=2003Sci...301..386C}}</ref> Serotonin may help to regulate other neurotransmitter systems, and decreased serotonin activity may "permit" these systems to act in unusual and erratic ways. Facets of depression may be [[emergence|emergent properties]] of this dysregulation.<ref name="Asymmetry and mood">{{cite journal |author=Mandell AJ, Knapp S |title=Asymmetry and mood, emergent properties of serotonin regulation: A proposed mechanism of action of lithium |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=909–16 |year=1979|pmid=454111 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1979.01780080083019}}</ref>

An offshoot of the monoamine hypothesis suggests that [[monoamine oxidase A]] (MAO-A), an enzyme which metabolizes monoamines, may be overly active in depressed people. This would, in turn, cause the lowered levels of monoamines. This hypothesis received support from a [[positron emission tomography|PET]] study, which found significantly elevated activity of MAO-A in the brain of some depressed people.<ref name="Meyer06">{{cite journal |author=Meyer JH, Ginovart N, Boovariwala A, ''et al.'' |title=Elevated monoamine oxidase a levels in the brain: An explanation for the monoamine imbalance of major depression |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=63 |issue=11 |pages=1209–16 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17088501 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.11.1209 |url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/63/11/1209}}</ref> In genetic studies, the alterations of MAO-A-related genes have not been consistently associated with depression.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.informaworld.com/10.1080/15622970701816506 |title= Association of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) polymorphisms and clinical subgroups of major depressive disorders in the Han Chinese population |accessdate=2008-09-20 |author=Huang SY, Lin MT, Lin WW; Huang CC; Shy MJ; Lu RB |date=2007-12-19 |journal=World Journal of Biological Psychiatry|publisher=Informa Healthcare|doi=10.1080/15622970701816506 |pmid=19224413 |volume=10 |issue=4 Pt 2 |pages=544–51}}</ref><ref name="pmid15956990">{{cite journal |author=Yu YW, Tsai SJ, Hong CJ, Chen TJ, Chen MC, Yang CW |title=Association study of a monoamine oxidase a gene promoter polymorphism with major depressive disorder and antidepressant response |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=30 |issue=9 |pages=1719–23 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=15956990 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300785 |url=}}</ref> Contrary to the assumptions of the monoamine hypothesis, lowered but not heightened activity of MAO-A was associated with the depressive symptoms in youth.

Since the 1990ies, research has uncovered multiple limitations of the monoamine hypothesis, and its inadequacy has been criticized within the psychiatric community.<ref name="pmid10775017">{{cite journal |author=Hirschfeld RM |title=History and evolution of the monoamine hypothesis of depression |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=61 Suppl 6 |issue= |pages=4–6 |year=2000 |pmid=10775017 |doi= |url=}}</ref> For one thing, Serotonin system dysfunction cannot be the sole cause of depression;  [[antidepressant]]s usually bring serotonin levels up to normal very quickly, but it often takes at least two to four weeks before mood improves significantly.

==Abnormalities by brain region==
Research on the brains of depressed patients usually shows disturbed pattern of interaction between multiple parts of the brain. Several areas of the brain are implicated in studies seeking to more fully understand the biology of depression:

===Raphe nuclei===
The sole source of [[serotonin]] in the brain is the [[raphe nuclei]], a group of small nerve cell [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] in the upper [[brain stem]], located directly at the mid-line of the brain.  There is some evidence for neuropathological abnormalities in the [[Anatomical terms of location#Other directional terms|rostral]] raphe nuclei in depression.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Underwood MD, Khaibulina AA, Ellis SP, Moran A, Rice PM, Mann JJ, Arango V |title=Morphometry of the dorsal raphe nucleus serotonergic neurons in suicide victims | journal=Biol Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=473–83 |year=1999 |month=August |pmid=10459396}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Arango V, Underwood MD, Boldrini M, Tamir H, Kassir SA, Hsiung S, Chen JJ, Mann JJ |title= Serotonin 1A receptors, serotonin transporter binding and serotonin transporter mRNA expression in the brainstem of depressed suicide victims | journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=892–903 |year=2001 |month=December |pmid=11750182 |doi=10.1016/S0893-133X(01)00310-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Matthews PR, Harrison PJ |title=A morphometric, immunohistochemical, and in situ hybridization study of the dorsal raphe nucleus in major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and suicide |journal=J Affect Disord |volume=137 |issue=1-3 |pages=125–134 |year=2012 |month=March |pmid=22129767 |pmc=3314923 |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2011.10.043}}</ref> Despite their small size, they reach very widely through their projections, and are involved in a very diverse set of functions.  Most antidepressants are [[serotonergic]].

===Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)===
The [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN) is the control center for the body's "biological clock."  It contains neurons whose activity waxes and wanes throughout the day.  The output from the SCN controls the sleep/wake cycle as well as a number of other biological rhythms, such as fluctuations in body temperature.  Disturbances of these cycles are a consistent symptom of depression, especially of the melancholic type.  The "classic" pattern is for depressed people to have great difficulty falling asleep at night, and then to wake bolt upright at around 3 AM.  The waking is usually preceded by a rise in body temperature, which in non-depressed people does not usually occur until several hours later.  It is a common observation that antidepressants produce a return to normal sleep patterns before they produce an improvement in mood:  if good sleep does not return, it is a strong sign that the treatment is not going to be effective.  Conversely, disruptions to sleep are often the first indication of impending relapse.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

There is a powerful interaction between the Raphe nuclei and the SCN.  On one hand, the Raphe nuclei send a strong serotonergic projection to the SCN.  In animal studies, this input has been shown to modulate the ability of light to reset the timing of the biological clock:  the more serotonin, the stronger the effects of light.  On the other hand, the biological clock exerts a strong influence on the Raphe nuclei:  serotonin levels drop during sleep, and fall almost to nothing during REM (dreaming) sleep.  It is worth noting that one of the characteristics of sleep in depressed people is that REM tends to appear very soon after sleep onset, whereas in non-depressed people it does not usually dominate sleep until the last hours, in the early morning.  Antidepressants are powerful suppressors of REM. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Ventral tegmental area (VTA)===
The [[ventral tegmentum]] (or ventral tegmental area) is a small area in the basal midbrain which is a critical part of the brain's reward system.  It sends projections to the ''[[nucleus accumbens]]'' that use the neurotransmitter [[dopamine]].  Addictive drugs universally increase the effects of dopamine in this system, whereas drugs that oppose dopamine produce [[anhedonia]] of the sort seen in depressed people.  Dopamine-enhancers such as cocaine often relieve the lack-of-pleasure in depression, but the effects only last as long as a drug is present in the body:  that is, they temporarily alleviate one of the main symptoms, but do not help to cure the disease.

===Nucleus accumbens (NAc)===
Long-term exposure to various unavoidable stress factors decreases dopamine release in the [[Nucleus accumbens|NAc]] shell,<ref name="pmid10624543">{{cite journal |author=Di Chiara G, Loddo P, Tanda G |title=Reciprocal changes in prefrontal and limbic dopamine responsiveness to aversive and rewarding stimuli after chronic mild stress: implications for the psychobiology of depression |journal=Biol.

===Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)===
The [[anterior cingulate cortex]] is activated by negative experiences of many types, and consistently shows higher levels of activity in depressed people than in non-depressed people.  The functions of the ACC are controversial, but one proposal is that it mediates the conscious experience of suffering.  Several decades ago, trials were made of ablating parts of the ACC in an attempt to relieve intolerable pain in patients who were terminally ill.  These patients reported that after the surgery, they could still perceive the physical sensations of pain, but they no longer found them distressing.  (The effects of heroin and morphine are sometimes described in the same way.)  Very recently, clinical experiments were made in using [[deep brain stimulation]] to temporarily inactivate the ACC in severely depressed patients.  This was not effective in all cases, but in some patients very striking results were achieved, with a perceptible lifting of mood immediately apparent to the patient as soon as the stimulus was applied.

===Subgenual cingulate===
Recent studies have shown that [[Subgenual cingulate|Brodmann area 25]], also known as [[Subgenual cingulate]] is metabolically overactive in [[treatment-resistant depression]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mayberg HS, Brannan SK, Tekell JL, Silva JA, Mahurin RK, McGinnis S, Jerabek PA | year = 2000 | month = Oct | title = Regional metabolic effects of fluoxetine in major depression: serial changes and relationship to clinical response | url = | journal = Biol Psychiatry | volume = 48 | issue = 8| pages = 830–43 }}</ref> This region is extremely rich in [[serotonin transporter]]s and is considered as a governor for a vast network involving areas like [[hypothalamus]] and [[brain stem]], which influences changes in appetite and sleep; the [[amygdala]] and [[Insular cortex|insula]], which affect the mood and anxiety; the [[hippocampus]], which plays an important role in memory formation; and some parts of the [[frontal cortex]] responsible for self-esteem.<ref name="sciam1">"[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=faulty-circuits Faulty Circuits]", ''Scientific American'', April 2010</ref> Thus disturbances in this area or a smaller than normal size of this area contributes to depression.

==Altered neuroplasticity==
Recent studies have called attention to the role of altered [[neuroplasticity]] in depression. Pittenger and Duman<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Stress, Depression, and Neuroplasticity: A Convergence of Mechanisms|author=Christopher Pittenger and Ronald S Duman|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|volume=33|pages=88–109|year=2008|url=http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v33/n1/full/1301574a.html|issue=1|doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1301574|pmid=17851537|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref> have reviewed extensive research, demonstrating a convergence of three phenomena:

# Chronic stress reduces synaptic and dendritic plasticity
# Depressed subjects show evidence of impaired neuroplasticity (e.g. shortening and reduced complexity of dendritic trees)
# Anti-depressant medications enhance neuroplasticity at both a molecular and dendritic level.

They conclude that disrupted neuroplasticity is an underlying feature of depression, and is reversed by antidepressants.

==Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis==
The [[Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] is a chain of [[endocrine]] structures that are activated during the body's response to stressors of various sorts.  It often shows increased activation in depressed people, and drugs that reduce its activity are sometimes effective in reducing symptoms.  The HPA influences many parts of the brain, including the Raphe nuclei.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Large-scale brain network theory==
Psychiatric and neurological disorders can be characterized by connectivity within and between large-scale brain networks.<ref name="menon2011">{{cite journal|last=Menon|first=Vinod|title=Large-scale brain networks and psychopathology: a unifying triple network model|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|year=2011|month=October|volume=15|issue=10}}</ref>  These networks are important to study because they can provide a better understanding of the impact of these disorders, more so than studying one brain region, as recent research has shown that multiple brain regions are involved in these disorders. Understanding the disruptions in these networks may provide important insights into interventions for treating these disorders. Recent work suggests that at least three large-scale brain networks are important in psychopathology:<ref name="menon2011"/>

The central executive network is made up of fronto-parietal regions, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and lateral posterior parietal cortex.<ref name="seeley2007">{{cite journal|last=Seeley|first=W.W|coauthors=et al.|title=Dissociable intrinsic connectivity networks for salience processing and executive control|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|year=2007|month=February|volume=27}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Habas|first=C|coauthors=et al.|title=Distinct cerebellar contributions to intrinsic connectivity networks|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=1 July 2009|volume=29}}</ref> Studies have shown that this network is crucially involved in maintaining and using information in [[working memory]], problem solving, and decision making.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Petrides|first=M|title=Lateral prefrontal cortex: architecture and functional organization|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|year=2005|pages=781–795}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Koechlin|first=E|coauthors=Summerfield, C|title=An information theoretical approach to prefrontal executive function|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|year=2007|pages=229–235}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=E.K.|coauthors=Cohen, J.D.|title=An intergrative theory of prefrontal cortex function|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|year=2001|pages=167–202}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Muller|first=N.G.|coauthors=Knight, R.T.|title=The functional neuroanatomy of working memory: contributions of human brain lesion studies|journal=Neuroscience|year=2006|pages=51–58}}</ref> Deficiencies in this network are common in most major psychiatric and neurological disorders, including depression.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Woodward|first=N.D.|coauthors=et al.|title=Functional resting-state networks are differentially affected in schizophrenia|journal=Schizophrenia Research|year=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Menon|first=Vinod|coauthors=et al.|title=Functional neuroanatomy of auditory working memory in schizophrenia: relation to positive and negative symptoms|journal=Neuroimage|year=2001|volume=13|pages=433–446}}</ref> Because this network is crucial for everyday life activities, those who are depressed can show impairment in basic activities like test taking and being decisive.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=R.L.|coauthors=et al.|title=Cognitive deficits in depression and functional specificity of regional brain activity.|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|year=2007|volume=31|page=211|page=233}}</ref>

===Default Mode Network===
The default mode network includes hubs in the prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate, with other prominent regions of the network in the medial temporal lobe and angular gyrus.<ref name="menon2011"/> The default mode network is usually active during mind-wandering and thinking about social situations. In contrast, during specific tasks probed in cognitive science (for example, simple attention tasks), the default network is often deactivated.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Qin|first=P|coauthors=Northoff, G|title=How is our self related to midline regions and the default mode network?|journal=Neuroimage|year=2011|volume=57|pages=1221–1233}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Raichle|first=M.E.|coauthors=et al.|title=A default mode of brain function|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2001|volume=98|pages=676–682}}</ref> Research has shown that regions in the default mode network (including medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate) show greater activity when depressed participants ruminate (that is, when they engage in repetitive self-focused thinking) than when typical, healthy participants ruminate.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cooney|first=R.E.|coauthors=et al.|title=Neural correlates of rumination in depression|journal=Cognitive Affective and Behavioral Neuroscience|year=2010|volume=10|issue=4|pages=470–478}}</ref>  Individuals suffering from major depression also show increased connectivity between the default mode network and the subgenual cingulate and the adjoining ventromedial prefrontal cortex in comparison to healthy individuals, individuals suffering from dementia, and autistic individuals. Numerous studies suggest that the subgenual cingulate plays an important role in the dysfunction that characterizes major depression.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Broyd|first=S.J.|coauthors=et al.|title=Default mode brain dysfunction in mental disorders: a systematic review|journal=Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews|year=2009|volume=33|pages=279–296}}</ref>  The increased activation in the default mode network during rumination and the atypical connectivity between core default mode regions and the subgenual cingulate may underlie the tendency for depressed individual to get “stuck” in the negative, self-focused thoughts that often characterize depression.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hamani|first=C|coauthors=et al.|title=The subcallosal cingulate gyrus in the context of major depression|journal=Biological Psychiatry|date=15 February 2011|volume=69|page=301|page=309}}</ref> However, further research is needed to gain a precise understanding of how these network interactions map to specific symptoms of depression.

===Salience Network===
The salience network is a cingulate-frontal operculum network that includes core nodes in the anterior cingulate and anterior insula.<ref name="seeley2007"/>  Salience refers to the process by which highly processed sensory information is integrated with information from the body to guide attention and action.<ref name="seeley2007"/>  Individuals who have a tendency to experience negative emotional states (scoring high on measures of [[neuroticism]]) show an increase in the right anterior insula during decision-making, even if the decision has already been made.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Feinstein|first=J.S.|coauthors=et al.|title=Anterior insula reactivity during certain decisions is associated with neuroticism|journal=Social Cognition and Affective Neuroscience|year=2006|month=September|volume=1|issue=2|pages=136–142}}</ref>  This atypically high activity in the right anterior insula is thought to contribute to the experience of negative and worrisome feelings.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Paulus|first=M.P|coauthors=Stein, M.B.|title=An insular view of anxiety|journal=Biological Psychiatry|year=2006|volume=60|pages=383–387}}</ref>  In major depressive disorder, anxiety is often a part of the emotional state that characterizes depression.<ref>{{cite book|last=Antony|first=M.M.|title=Oxford Handbook of Anxiety and Related Disorders|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>
