'''Herbert Needleman''', MD, known for research studies on the neurodevelopmental damage caused by [[lead poisoning]], is a [[pediatrician]], child [[psychiatrist]], researcher and professor at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] Medical Center, an elected member of the [[Institute of Medicine]], and the founder of the Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning (now known as the [[Alliance for Healthy Homes]]). Dr. Needleman played a key role in securing some of the most significant environmental health protections achieved during the 20th century, which resulted in a fivefold reduction in the prevalence of [[lead poisoning]] among children in the [[United States]] by the early 1990s. Despite engendering strong resistance from related industries, which made him the target of frequent attacks, Needleman persisted in campaigning to educate [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]], including parents and government panels, about the dangers of lead poisoning.   Needleman has been credited with having played the key role in triggering environmental safety measures that have reduced average blood lead levels by an estimated 78 percent between 1976 and 1991.

==Education and faculty appointments==

Needleman earned his BS from [[Muhlenberg College]] in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], and his MD from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1952.  He trained in Pediatrics at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and served as Chief Resident, he completed a fellowship in Pediatric Cardiology and Rheumatic Fever through the National Institutes of Health.  After Practicing family Pediatrics in Philadelphia and Neonatology at [[Pennsylvania Hospital]], Dr. Needleman completed a residency in [[psychiatry]] at [[Temple University]] Health Sciences Center in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. From 1971 to 1980, he was an assistant professor of psychiatry at Temple University and at [[Harvard University Medical School]], in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] from 1980 to 1981,   Since 1981, he has been a professor of child psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

==Lead poisoning research==

In the 1970s, Needleman conducted a study at [[Harvard Medical School]] that yielded strong evidence that lead, even at very low levels, can affect a child's [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]. By measuring levels of lead in childrenâ€™s teeth, Needleman provided the first evidence that low level lead exposure not only reduces IQs, but also shortens attention spans and delays acquisition of language proficiency. In studies that followed, he determined that lead poisoning had long term implications for a child's attentiveness, behavior, and academic success. 

In 1979, Needleman began the first large scale study of intelligence and behavior in children with no outward signs of lead poisoning. His research showed that lead exposure is associated with increased risk for failure to graduate from high school and for reading disabilities. His research involved testing the concentration of lead in bones of 194 juveniles, between the ages of twelve and eighteen, who had been convicted in the [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] Juvenile Court, and 146 students in regular high schools in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] who did not have behavioral problems. In 1996, findings from the research, reporting on the physical and behavioral problems caused by leaded gasoline and lead paint while linking lead exposure to anti-social behavior, were published in the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]]. The study found delinquent children were four times more likely to have elevated concentrations of lead in their bones. According to Needleman, "Lead is a brain poison that interferes with the ability to restrain impulses. It's a life experience which gets into biology and increases a child's risk for doing bad things."

After extensive scientific review, Needleman's findings were instrumental in convincing the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) to issue guidelines for the diagnosis and management of lead poisoning in children, in goading the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to mandate the removal of lead from [[gasoline]] and inducing the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] to ban lead from interior paints. Needleman's research also helped cause the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) to remove lead from thousands of housing units across the US.

Needleman designed the first forward study of lead exposure during [[gestation]], and showed that such exposure is associated with [[Cognition|cognitive]] deficits later in life. His most recent research has shown that boys with high levels of lead concentrated in their bones are more likely to develop aggressive or delinquent behavior, such as [[bullying]], [[vandalism]] and [[shoplifting]].

==''Raising Children Toxic Free''==

In their book, ''Raising Children Toxic Free:   How to Keep Your Child Safe from Lead, Asbestos, Pesticides, and Other Environmental Hazards'' (1996), Needleman and [[Philip J. Landrigan]] offer advice for parents and physicians on how to evaluate and minimize toxic exposure risks, which include lead, [[asbestos]], [[pesticide]]s, and other toxins.   They also address practical means for ensuring community compliance with existing laws

==Committee of Responsibility==

While an associate professor at Temple University's School of Medicine, Needleman was the chairman of the [[Committee of Responsibility]] (COR), throughout its existence between 1966 and 1974.[http://www.swarthmore.edu/Library/peace/DG151-175/DG173COR.html]  COR, which sought to help civilians injured in the [[Vietnam War]], was composed of medical personnel, scientists, clergymen, and citizens concerned about American involvement. In its efforts to assist injured Vietnamese children shelters were set up in [[Berkeley, California]] and [[Boston, Massachusetts]], both called Vietnam House, and another in [[Saigon]], where paraplegic children could be cared for and rehabilitated in their own country.

==Allegations of scientific misconduct==

Needleman's scientific methodology had long been challenged by Dr. Claire Ernhart, who has criticized it as not adequately controlling for confounding variables, and being subject to the [[multiple comparisons]] problem.  In 1983 when the EPA was reviewing its air quality standards, it rejected the results of both Needleman's and some of Ernhart's scientific work on the subject. Needleman challenged this criticism and after giving him more money to reanalyze the data, the EPA reversed its position, and adopted his conclusions in 1986.<ref name="science91">{{cite web|url=http://tobaccodocuments.org/pm/2025545942-5944.pdf|title=Get-the-lead-out Guru Challenged|publisher=Science|date=23 August 1991}}</ref>

In 1990 a [[Superfund]] (industrial pollution clean up case) was brought against the owners of a defunct lead mill in Utah where houses had been built on the land where the tailings had been deposited.<ref name="itconv08"/>  The state hired Needleman as an expert witness and the corporations in their defence turned to Ernhart and psychologist [[Sandra Scarr]] from the University of Virginia.  Ernhart and Scarr gained access to the raw data for a day, after which they had to leave after a federal government lawyer attempted to have them sign a gagging order preventing them from discussing the data in public. Based on what she saw of the printouts, Scarr concluded that Needleman had discarded potentially significant explanatory variables after his first analysis failed to show a lead-IQ relationship until "he got the results he wanted".<ref name="science91"/> The two charged Needleman through the [[National Institute of Health]] with [[scientific misconduct]].<ref name="newsweek91">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/118659|title=Lead, Lies and Datatape|date=16 March 1991|publisher=Newsweek}}</ref>

Needleman says that the case against him was made by a law firm from Philadelphia who refused to name the company who was paying them.<ref name="itconv08"/> He says that against the wishes of his university, he fought to have his case held in public and was eventually exonerated.<ref name="itconv08">{{cite web|url=http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3938.html#|title=Tech Nation - Lead Poisoning in Children|publisher=ITConversations|date=15 December 2008}}</ref> According to Scarr: "Eventually, Needleman was found guilty of misrepresentation and had to retract research reports in the journals that published them."<ref name="models">O'Connell AN (2001).''Models of Achievement: Reflections of Eminent Women in Psychology, Vol.3.'' London: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. pp. 107-108 (Autobiographical Perspectives)</ref> According to [[environmental psychology]] professor Colleen F. Moore, Scarr and Ernhart "found a published graph that was slightly in error, and Needleman eventually published a correction".<ref name="Moore2009">{{cite book|author=Colleen F. Moore|title=Children and Pollution: Why Scientists Disagree|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CdHv89Qv7fcC&pg=PA19|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-538666-0|page=19}}</ref> The lawsuit and subsequent inquiry remain controversial; according to [[philosopher of science]] [[Clark N. Glymour]], "Scarr and Ernhart are sometimes dismissed as tools of the lead industry, but I know of no evidence that they were other than sincere." Glymour however thinks that Scarr and Ernhart were wrong on their methodological findings.<ref name="Glymour2010">{{cite book|author=Clark N. Glymour|title=Galileo in Pittsburgh|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W8sywxJ1ZLAC&pg=PA56|year=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05103-4|pages=56-63}}</ref>

EPA scientist [[Joel Schwartz]] told Newsweek in 1991 that a reanalysis of Needleman's data incorporating the factor of age, which had been excluded, "found essentially the identical results". By that point, Needleman's research had been superseded by newer research used to justify even lower limits.<ref name="newsweek91"/>
