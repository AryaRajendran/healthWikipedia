A '''Colles' fracture''', also '''Colles fracture''', is a [[fracture (bone)|fracture]] of the [[distal]] [[radius (bone)|radius]] in the forearm with dorsal (posterior) displacement of the wrist and hand. The fracture is sometimes referred to as a "[[dinner fork]]" or "[[bayonet]]" deformity due to the shape of the resultant forearm. For a more detailed discussion see [[distal radius fracture]].

== Terminology ==

The term Colles fracture is classically used to describe a fracture at the distal end of the radius, at its cortico-cancellous junction. However, now the term tends to be used loosely to describe any fracture of the distal radius, with or without involvement of the [[ulna]], that has dorsal displacement of the fracture fragments. Colles himself described it as a fracture that “takes place at about an inch and a half (38mm) above the carpal extremity of the radius” and “the carpus and the base of metacarpus appears to be thrown backward”.<ref>Colles A 2006 On the fracture of the carpal extremity of the radius. Edinb Med Surg J. 1814;10:181. Clin Orthop Relat Res 445:5-7.</ref>

The classic Colles fracture has the following characteristics:<ref>{{cite web

* [[Transverse plane|Transverse]] fracture of the radius
* 2.5&nbsp;cm (0.98&nbsp;inches) [[proximal]] to the [[radio-carpal joint]]
* [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] [[Displacement (orthopedic surgery)|displacement]] and apex volar angulation

== Causes ==

The fracture is most commonly caused by people falling onto a hard surface and breaking their fall with outstretched arms - falling with [[wrist]]s flexed would lead to a [[Smith's fracture]]. It can also be caused by overuse. Originally it was described in elderly and/or post-menopausal women. It usually occurs about three to five centimetres proximal to the [[radio-carpal joint]] with posterior and lateral displacement of the distal fragment resulting in the characteristic "dinner fork" or "bayonet" like deformity. Colles' fracture is a common fracture in people with [[osteoporosis]], second only to [[vertebral]] [[bone fracture|fractures]].

* Dorsal tilt
* Radial shortening
* Loss of ulnar inclination
* Radial angulation of the wrist
* Dorsal displacement of the distal fragment
* Comminution at the fracture site
* Associated fracture of the ulnar styloid process in more than 60% of cases.

== Treatment ==

Management depends on the severity of the fracture. An undisplaced fracture may be treated with a cast alone. The cast is applied with the distal fragment in [[palmar flexion]] and ulnar deviation.  A fracture with mild angulation and displacement may require closed [[reduction (orthopedic surgery)|reduction]]. There is some evidence that immobilization with the wrist in [[dorsiflexion]] as opposed to [[palmarflexion]] results in less redisplacement and better functional status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/distal_radius_frx_position_of_immobilization |title=Adult Distal Radius Frx: Non Operative Treatment - Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Significant angulation and deformity may require an [[Open reduction internal fixation|open reduction and internal fixation]] or [[external fixation]]. The volar forearm splint is best for temporary immobilization of forearm, wrist and hand fractures, including Colles' fracture.
There are several established instability criteria:
dorsal tilt >20°,
comminuted fracture,
abruption of the ulnar styloid process,
intraarticular displacement >1mm,
loss of radial height >2mm.

A higher amount of instability criteria increases the likelihood of operative treatment.

Treatment modalities differ in the elderly.<ref>William G Blakeney.Stabilization and treatment of Colles’ fractures in elderly patients. http://www.dovepress.com/articles.php?article_id=5677</ref>

== Eponym ==

It is named after [[Abraham Colles]] (1773–1843), an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[surgery|surgeon]] who first described it in 1814 just by looking at the classical deformity before the advent of [[X-rays]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2152}}</ref>  [[Ernest Amory Codman]] was the first to study it using X-rays.  His article, published in the ''Boston Medical and Surgical Journal'', now known as [[The New England Journal of Medicine]], also developed the classification system.<ref>

== In older and younger people ==

Colles fractures occur in all age groups, although certain patterns follow an age distribution. 

* In the elderly, because of the weaker cortex, the fracture is more often extra-articular.
* Younger individuals tend to require a higher energy force to cause the fracture and tend to have more complex [[intra-articular]] fractures. In children with open [[Epiphyseal plate|epiphyses]], an equivalent fracture is the "epiphyseal slip", as can be seen in other joints, such as a [[slipped capital femoral epiphysis]] in the hip. This is a [[Salter-Harris fractures|Salter I or II fracture]] with the deforming forces directed through the weaker [[epiphyseal plate]].
* More common in women because of post-menopausal osteoporosis.
