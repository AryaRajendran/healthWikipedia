'''Cholinergic urticaria''' (CU) is one of the physical [[urticaria]] which is provoked following sweating events.<ref name="PCU">{{Cite pmid|21371134|noedit}}</ref>

==History==
CU was first described by Duke<ref>DUKE WW. URTICARIA CAUSED SPECIFICALLY BY THE ACTION OF PHYSICAL AGENTS: (LIGHT, COLD, HEAT, FREEZING, BURNS, MECHANICAL IRRITATION, AND PHYSICAL AND MENTAL EXERTION). JAMA. 1924;83(1):3-9. doi:10.1001/jama.1924.02660010007002. </ref> in 1924. The term ''cholinergic'' derives from the finding that hives similar to those of CU can be elicited using cholinergic agonists (e.g. [[methacholine]]), thus suggesting the etiology of CU to includes events that are triggered by a cholinergic stimulus.

==Symptoms==
CU presents with a number of small, short-lasting hives that develops usually in response to exercise, bathing, staying in a heated environment, or emotional stress.<ref name="CU2009REF2">{{Cite pmid|5706797|noedit}}</ref><ref name="CU2009REF3">{{Cite pmid|3827277|noedit}}</ref> Although the symptoms subside rapidly, commonly within 1 hour, CU may significantly impair quality of life, especially in relation to sporting and sexual activities.<ref name="CU2009REF4">{{Cite pmid|10233318|noedit}}</ref>

==Causes==
* Sweat hypersensitivity 
* Acquired anhidrosis and/or [[hypohidrosis]]
* [[Idiopathic]]

==Subtypes==

===Sweat hypersensitivity===
This subtype refers to those with CU who are hypersensitive to their own sweat.

====Diagnosis====
Positive reaction to intradermal injection of [[autologous]] sweat.<ref name="RDCU">{{Cite pmid|21364312|noedit}}</ref>

====Features====
Wheals are observed coinciding with perspiration points of sweating.<ref name="PCU2012">{{Cite pmid|23093795|noedit}}</ref>

====Pathophysiology====
Tanaka et al. found that the sweat-induced release of [[histamine]] from [[basophils]] is mediated by specific [[IgE]] for the partially purified [[antigen]] present in the sweat of patients with [[atopic dermatitis]]. The sweat hyper-sensitivities of CU and atopic dermatitis seem to be virtually the same, and therefore, the sweat-induced histamine release from basophils may also be mediated by a specific IgE for sweat in atopic dermatitis as well as CU.<ref name="PCU2012"/>

====Treatment====
* '''Proposed first-line treatment:''' Rapid desensitization protocol using autologous sweat.<ref name="RDCU"/>

* '''Non-pharmacological treatment:''' Forced perspiration by excessive body warming (hot bath or exercise) used daily may reduce the symptoms of prickling pain through exhaustion of inflammatory mediators.<ref name="hypo-inter">{{Cite pmid|12037443|noedit}}</ref> [[Contraindicated]] in those with CU as a result of [[hypohidrosis]] (see below).

* '''Antihistamines''' are a commonly prescribed first-line treatment for conventional urticaria, but its effectiveness in the treatment of CU is rather limited in most cases.<ref name="PCU"/>

* '''Treatment(s) with mixed success:''' [[omalizumab]] (anti-igE therapy),<ref name="igE-pos">{{Cite pmid|18186820|noedit}}</ref><ref name="igE-neg">{{Cite pmid|19925484|noedit}}</ref> [[danazol]] (synthetic androgen),<ref name="danazol">{{Cite pmid|16865874|noedit}}</ref> [[propranolol]] (beta blocker).<ref name="propranolol">{{Cite pmid|2973859|noedit}}</ref><ref name="propranolol2">{{Cite pmid|10460061|noedit}}</ref>

===Acquired anhidrosis and/or hypohidrosis===
This subtype refers to those with CU who have abnormally reduced sweating.

====Diagnosis====
Sweat is readily visualized by a topical indicator such as iodinated starch or sodium alizarin sulphonate. Both undergo a dramatic colour change when moistened by sweat. A thermoregulatory sweat test evaluates the body’s response to a thermal stimulus by inducing sweating through the use of a hot box ⁄ room, thermal blanket or exercise. Failure of the topical indicator to undergo a colour change during thermoregulatory sweat testing can indicate anhidrosis and/or [[hypohidrosis]] (see [[minor test]]).<ref name="AHYPO">{{Cite pmid|23094789|noedit}}</ref>

[[Microscopic]] analysis may include screening of/for the following: 
* [[Eccrine sweat gland]] anatomy 
* Cholinergic receptor muscarin 3 (CHRM3) expression 
* Lymphocytic infiltration (CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ [[T cells]]).<ref name="PCU2012"/>

====Features====
Severe heat intolerance (e.g., nausea, dizziness, and headache), and tingling, pricking, or burning pain over the entire body on exposure to hot environments or prolonged exercise which improve after cooling the body. Occurs in the absence of any causative skin, metabolic, or [[neurological disorders]]. 
Uniquely the [[adrenergic]] innervated [[apocrine sweat glands]] remain functional.<ref name="IPSF">{{Cite pmid|15505168|noedit}}</ref>

[[File:CU associated with hypohidrosis.png|thumb|right|Proposed mechanism of urticaria induction in those with cholinergic urticaria and associated hypohidrosis.]]
====Pathophysiology====

[[Muscarinic]] cholinergic receptors around [[sweat glands]] may be reduced in numbers causing unbound [[acetylcholine]] to act on both [[mast cells]] and [[sensory nerve]] terminals causing urticaria and pain.<ref name="IPSF"/>

====Treatment====

* '''First-line treatment:''' Systemic steroid therapy ([[methylprednisolone]] pulse - IVMP).<ref name="IPSF"/><ref name="TAIGA">{{Cite pmid|22709381|noedit}}</ref>

* '''Non-pharmacological treatment:''' In the absence of sweat, cold-water sprays and wet towels can be used increase the evaporative loss of heat from the skin. Shifting to a cooler or air-conditioned environments when necessary can also reduce discomfort. In the event of severe hyperthermia (body temperature >106 °F), drastic measures such as immersion in ice-cold water are necessary to prevent irreversible brain damage.<ref name="AIGA_guide">{{Cite pmid|12780708|noedit}}</ref>

===Idiopathic===
Unknown or unclassified at this time. Representing those who do not fall under any of the above categories.
