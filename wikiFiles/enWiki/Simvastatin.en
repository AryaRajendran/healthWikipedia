'''Simvastatin''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|s|ɪ|m|v|ə|s|t|æ|t|ɨ|n}}) is a [[hypolipidemic agent|hypolipidemic drug]] used with exercise, diet, and weight-loss to control elevated cholesterol, or [[hypercholesterolemia]]. It is a member of the [[statin]] class of pharmaceuticals.

Simvastatin is a synthetic derivative of a fermentation product of ''[[Aspergillus terreus]]''.  The drug is marketed generically following patent expiry, and under the trade name '''Zocor'''.

==Medical uses==
The primary uses of simvastatin is for the treatment of [[dyslipidemia]] and the prevention of [[cardiovascular disease]].<ref name=AHFS/> It is recommended to be used only after other measures such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction have not improved cholesterol levels sufficiently.<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Simvastatin|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/simvastatin.html|author=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011|publisher=Drugs.com}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Common side effects (>1% incidence) may include abdominal pain, diarrhoea, indigestion, and a general feeling of weakness. Rare side effects include joint pain, memory loss, and muscle cramps.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chealth.canoe.ca/drug_info_details.asp?channel_id=0&relation_id=0&brand_name_id=3499&page_no= |title=Mylan-Simvastatin|accessdate=2007-08-15|format= |work=}}</ref> Cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, rhabdomyolysis (destruction of muscles and blockade of renal system) and myositis have been reported in patients receiving the drug chronically.<ref>R.

A type of DNA variant known as a [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) may help predict individuals prone to developing [[myopathy]] when taking simvastatin; a study ultimately including 32,000 patients concluded the carriers of one or two risk [[allele]]s of particular SNPs<ref>[http://www.snpedia.com/index.php?title=Rs4149056 rs4149056]</ref> were at a five-fold or 16-fold increased risk, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal | last = SEARCH Collaborative Group, | coauthors =Link E, Parish S, Armitage J, Bowman L, Heath S, Matsuda F, Gut I, Lathrop M, Collins R | title =SLCO1B1 variants and statin-induced myopathy--a genomewide study | journal =N Engl J Med. | volume =359 | pmid =18650507 | year = 2008 | first1 = Group | issue = 8 | pages = 789–99 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0801936 | url = http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa0801936 | format = pdf }}</ref>

On June 8, 2011, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) announced new safety recommendations for high-dose simvastatin (80&nbsp;mg) due to muscle injury risk.<ref>{{cite press release |title=FDA announces new safety recommendations for high-dose simvastatin | url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm258338.htm| publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) | accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://healthland.time.com/2011/06/09/fda-restricts-use-of-high-doses-of-cholesterol-lowering-drug-zocor/ "FDA Restricts Use of High Doses of Cholesterol-Lowering Drug Zocor"]. ''Time''. June 9, 2011.</ref>

In March 2012, the FDA updated its guidance for statin users to address reports of memory loss, liver damage, increased blood sugar, development of type 2 diabetes, and muscle injury.<ref>{{cite web|title=FDA Expands Advice on Statin Risks|url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm293330.htm|publisher=FDA|accessdate=12 July 2012}}</ref> The new guidance indicates:
* FDA has found that liver injury associated with statin use is rare but can occur.
* The reports about memory loss, forgetfulness and confusion span all statin products and all age groups. Egan says these experiences are rare but that those affected often report feeling “fuzzy” or unfocused in their thinking.
* A small increased risk of raised blood sugar levels and the development of type 2 diabetes have been reported with the use of statins.
* Some drugs interact with statins in a way that increases the risk of muscle injury called myopathy, characterized by unexplained muscle weakness or pain.

This advice has caused some controversy, and claims have been made that it is too conservative in its guidance regarding diabetes. In March 2012, Dr. [[Eric J. Topol]], the Chief Academic Officer for [[Scripps Health]] and Director, Scripps Translational Science Institute, published an op-ed piece in the [[New York Times]] entitled 'The Diabetes Dilemma for Statin Users'<ref>{{cite news|last=Topol|first=Eric|title=The Diabetes Dilemma for Statin Users|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/opinion/the-diabetes-dilemma-for-statin-users.html|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 4, 2012}}</ref> claiming the trial data had been misunderstood and the risk of diabetes amongst users of simvistatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin was much higher.

==Cost/benefit==
Since its introduction, the price of lipid-lowering drugs and their benefits in [[atherosclerosis]] has been much debated. Although this has affected the other [[statin]]s, simvastatin was the first statin drug to be used extensively in clinical practice.

A number of large [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies were conducted to discover which patients would benefit most from statin drugs; most studies involve simvastatin as the study drug. The most influential studies were the [[Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study]] (4S) and the [[Heart protection study]] (HPS).

It has been suggested that patients with one or more risk factors for [[cardiovascular disease]] (such as [[diabetes mellitus]], [[hypertension]], or a positive family history) can benefit from statins, even if they do not have substantially elevated cholesterol levels.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} This is the hypothetical concept of "total risk", by combining particular risk factors.

Simvastatin was introduced in the late 1980s, and since 2006 in many countries, it is available as a [[Generic drug|generic]] preparation. This has led to a decrease of the price of most statin drugs, and a reappraisal of the health economics of preventive statin treatment.  In the UK in 2008, the typical per patient cost to the NHS of simvastatin was about £1.50 per month.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/7192271.stm |title=NHS overspends on statins |date=Jan 2008 }}</ref> (40&nbsp;mg/day costs UK NHS £1.37/month in 2012<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cks.nhs.uk/diabetes_type_2/drugs_in_this_topic/scenario_managing_lipids/simvastatin_40mg_tablets |title=Simvastatin 40mg tablets }}</ref>)

==Dose==
Simvastatin is a powerful [[lipid]]-lowering drug that can decrease [[low density lipoprotein]] (LDL) levels by up to 50%.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} It is used in doses of 5&nbsp;[[milligram|mg]] up to 80&nbsp;mg. Higher doses (160&nbsp;mg) have been found to be too toxic, while giving only minimal benefit in terms of lipid lowering.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In [[secondary prevention]], 80&nbsp;mg per day reduced major cardiovascular events by an absolute rate of 1.2% compared with 20&nbsp;mg per day in a [[randomized controlled trial]].<ref name="pmid21067805">{{cite journal| title=Intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol with 80 mg versus 20 mg simvastatin daily in 12 064 survivors of myocardial infarction: a double-blind randomised trial | journal=The Lancet | year= 2010 | volume= 376 | issue= 9753 | pages= 1658–69 | pmid=21067805 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60310-8| author=SEARCH Collaborative Group| last2=Armitage| first2=J| last3=Bowman| first3=L| last4=Wallendszus| first4=K| last5=Bulbulia| first5=R| last6=Rahimi| first6=K| last7=Haynes| first7=R| last8=Parish| first8=S| last9=Peto| first9=R| pmc=2988223}}</ref>

==Pharmacology and dosage==
{{Main|Statin}}
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
[[Image:Simvastatin2.png|180px|thumb|right|A ball-and-stick model of Simvastatin]]

All statins act by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A [[HMG-CoA reductase]], the [[Rate-determining step|rate-limiting]] [[enzyme]] of the [[HMG-CoA reductase pathway]], the [[metabolic pathway]] responsible for the endogenous production of [[cholesterol]]. Statins are more effective than other lipid-regulating drugs at lowering LDL-[[cholesterol]] concentration, but they are less effective than the fibrates in reducing triglyceride concentration. However, statins reduce cardiovascular disease events and total mortality irrespective of the initial cholesterol concentration. This is a major evidence that the statins works in another way than the lowering of cholesterol (called pleiotropic effects).<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21391729 Pleiotropic effects of statins: evidence against benefits beyond LDL-cholesterol lowering.]</ref>

The drug is in the form of an inactive [[lactone]] that is [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] after ingestion to produce the active agent. It is a white, [[nonhygroscopic]], crystalline powder that is practically insoluble in water, and freely soluble in [[chloroform]], [[methanol]] and [[ethanol]].

===Interactions===
[[Grapefruit]] contains [[furanocoumarin]]s, notably [[bergamottin]] and 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin, which inhibit the intestinal [[cytochrome P450]] [[CYP3A4|3A4]] isoform. This, in turn, slows metabolization of simvastatin and a large number of other drugs, resulting in higher plasma levels of the drug. Due to the risk of toxicity, patients taking simvastatin should avoid intake of grapefruit and grapefruit-containing products.<ref>http://www.nelm.nhs.uk/en/Download/?file=MDs3NjgxMTI7L3VwbG9hZC9kb2N1bWVudHMvRXZpZGVuY2UvTWVkaWNpbmVzIFEgJmFtcDsgQS9TdGF0aW4gZ3JhcGVmcnVpdCB1cGRhdGUgRmViIDIwMTIuZG9j.doc ''National electronic library for medicines'']</ref>

On August 8, 2008, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] issued a warning of the risk of [[rhabdomyolysis]], which can lead to [[kidney failure]] or death, when simvastatin is used with [[amiodarone]]. This interaction is dose-dependent with simvastatin doses exceeding 20&nbsp;mg. This drug combination, especially with higher doses of simvastatin, should be avoided.<ref name="urlInformation on Simvastatin/Amiodarone">{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm118869.htm |title=Information on Simvastatin/Amiodarone |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)|accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref>

On March 19, 2010, the FDA issued another statement regarding simvastatin, saying it increases the risk of muscle injury ([[myopathy]]) when taken at high doses (80&nbsp;mg) or at lower doses in combination with other drugs. This conclusion is supported by the Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine (SEARCH) trial.<ref name="fda.gov">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm204882.htm</ref> The highest 80-mg dose rate causes muscle damage in 61 of every 1,000 patients, according to the research, in contrast to the lower 40-mg dose, which causes muscle damage in eight of 10,000 patients.<ref name=twsJunI>{{cite news

Also, a 2010 FDA review of simvastatin drug-drug interactions stated patients should not take simvastatin with [[itraconazole]], [[ketoconazole]], [[erythromycin]], [[clarithromycin]], [[telithromycin]], HIV protease inhibitors, or [[nefazodone]]. Patients taking 10&nbsp;mg of simvastatin should not take it with [[gemfibrozil]], [[cyclosporine]], or [[danazol]]. If taking 20&nbsp;mg of simvastatin, do not take it with [[amiodarone]] or [[verapamil]]. Diltiazem should not be taken with 40&nbsp;mg of simvastatin.<ref name="fda.gov"/> These drugs mentioned are CYP3A4 inhibitors which decrease the metabolism of simvastatin, therefore increasing the plasma activity of simvastatin, which leads to higher risk of developing rhabdomyolysis and myopathy.<ref name=Rxlist/>

Simvastatin was initially marketed by [[Merck & Co]] under the trade name Zocor, but is available generically in most countries following the patent expiry. A combination of simvastatin along with [[ezetimibe]] is sold under the brand name [[Vytorin]] and is jointly marketed by Merck and [[Schering-Plough]].

Brand names include Zocor, Zocor Heart Pro, marketed by the [[pharmaceutical company]] [[Merck & Co.]] Simlup, Simvotin, Simcard [India], Denan (Germany), Liponorm, Sinvacor, Sivastin (Italy), Lipovas (Japan), Lodales (France), Zocord (Austria and Sweden), Zimstat, Simvahexal (Australia), Lipex (Australia and New Zealand), Simvastatin-Teva, Simvacor, Simvaxon, Simovil (Israel), and others.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The primary U.S. patent for Zocor expired on June 23, 2006.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} [[Ranbaxy Laboratories]] (at the 80&nbsp;mg strength) and [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries]] through its Ivax Pharmaceuticals unit (at all other strengths) were given approval by the FDA to manufacture and sell simvastatin as a [[generic drug]] with 180-day exclusivity. [[Dr. Reddy's Laboratories]] also has a license from Merck & Co. to sell simvastatin as an authorized generic drug.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Sales==
Prior to losing U.S. patent protection, simvastatin was Merck & Co.'s largest selling drug and second largest selling cholesterol lowering drug in the world; it recorded US$4.3&nbsp;[[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] of sales in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Zocor had an original patent expiry date of January 2006 but was extended by the United States Patent Trademark Office (PTO) to expire on June 23, 2006.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The PTO granted the patent extension after Merck submitted data from studies of the drug’s positive effect on children, a move typically used by drug companies to lengthen exclusivity. In the UK the patent for simvastatin had expired by 2004.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Ordinarily, Merck would have expected a sharp decrease in sales after the generic versions of simvastatin entered the market. However, Merck has slashed the price of Zocor dramatically in an effort to claim sales that would have otherwise gone to the generic versions.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} At least two major U.S. health insurers, [[UnitedHealth Group|UnitedHealthcare]] and [[WellPoint]], are now{{when|date=June 2012}} offering Zocor to their members as generic [[copay]]s.<ref name = "pricewar">{{cite news | url=http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/060622/generic_drugs_zocor.html | title=Zocor Patent Expiring Means Bidding War | last=Brin | first=Dinah Wisenberg | agency=Associated Press
| date = 2006-06-22 | accessdate = 2006-07-09}}{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}</ref>

In addition, since Merck manufactures some versions of Dr. Reddy's authorized generic simvastatin,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Merck is poised to profit from Dr. Reddy's version. An 80&nbsp;mg, 30-count bottle of Dr. Reddy's simvastatin obtained July 6, 2006 states it is made by Merck Sharp & Dohme (Merck & Co.'s name outside the U.S. to avoid conflicts with [[Merck KGaA]]) in the UK, just like 80&nbsp;mg Zocor, and has a Merck & Co. logo on the bottom; except for omitting the "80" on one side, the tablets are visually identical to 80&nbsp;mg Zocor, including "543" on the other side which is the key part of the [[National Drug Code]] for 80&nbsp;mg Zocor.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==History==
The development of simvastatin was closely linked with [[lovastatin]]. Biochemist Jesse Huff and his colleagues at [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] began researching the biosynthesis of cholesterol in the early 1950s.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In 1956, [[mevalonic acid]] was isolated from a yeast extract by [[Karl Folkers]], Carl Hoffman, and others at Merck; while Huff and his associates confirmed that mevalonic acid was an intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In 1959, the [[HMG-CoA reductase]] enzyme (a major contributor of internal cholesterol production) was discovered by researchers at the [[Max Planck Institute]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} This discovery encouraged scientists worldwide to find an effective inhibitor of this enzyme.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

By 1976, [[Akira Endo (biochemist)|Akira Endo]] had isolated the first inhibitor ([[Compactin]], ML-236B) from the [[fungus]] ''[[Penicillium|Penicillium citrinium]]'' in [[Sankyo]], [[Japan]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Liao JK, Laufs U |title=Pleiotropic effects of statins |journal=Annu.

While developing and researching lovastatin, Merck scientists synthetically derived a more potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor from a fermentation product of ''Aspergillus terreus'', which was designated MK-733 (later to be named simvastatin).<ref name = "preview">{{cite book | title=Innovation Management - Strategies, Implementation, and Profits | url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~afuah/ | editor= Allan Afuah | year=1998 | publisher=Oxford University Press | author= Olivia Williams, Anne-Marie Jacks, Jim Davis, Sabrina Martinez |chapter=Case 10: Merck(A): Mevacor |chapterurl=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~afuah/cases/case10.html | isbn = 0-19-511346-2 | accessdate=2006-07-19}}</ref>
