'''Halitosis''' or '''bad breath''' occurs when noticeably [[unpleasant odor]]s are exhaled in breathing. Halitosis is estimated to be the third most frequent reason for seeking [[dentistry|dental]] aid, following [[tooth decay]] and [[periodontal disease]].<ref name=loesche>{{cite journal|pmid=12013345|year=2002|last1=Loesche|first1=WJ|last2=Kazor|first2=C|title=Microbiology and treatment of halitosis|volume=28|pages=256–79|journal=Periodontology 2000|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0757.2002.280111.x}}</ref>

Contrary to the popular legend that [[Listerine]] coined the term ''halitosis'', it actually dates from the 1870s,<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/halitosis Halitosis – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary]. Merriam-webster.com.

== Classification ==
Halitosis has been classified by location of the cause of the malodor and by [[aetiology]]. The primary subdivision is between Genuine halitosis and pseudo halitosis.

Where halitosis is genuine, this can be subdivided according location, for example '''intra-oral''' halitosis (within the mouth) and '''extra-oral''' halitosis (outside the mouth). Intraoral halitosis is also known as oral malodor and accounts for some 80-90% of genuine halitosis cases.

Genuine halitosis can also be thought of as either physiological, or pathological.

*Genuine Halitosis
**oral malodor (intra-oral halitosis)
**Extraoral halitosis
***Extra-oral Blood borne halitosis
***Extra-oral non-blood borne halitosis
****Upper respiratory tract (ENT) causes
****Lower respiratory tract causes
****Gastrointestinal halitosis
*Pseudohalitosis
**delusional halitosis
**olfactory halucinations/neurosensory disturbance

== Cause ==

=== Tongue ===
The most common location for mouth related halitosis is the [[tongue]].<ref name=nachnani0>{{cite journal|pmid=21462620|year=2011|last1=Nachnani|first1=S|title=Oral malodor: Causes, assessment, and treatment|volume=32|issue=1|pages=22–4, 26–8, 30–1; quiz 32, 34|journal=Compendium of continuing education in dentistry (Jamesburg, N.J. : 1995)}}</ref> Tongue bacteria produce malodorous compounds and fatty acids, and account for 80 to 90% of all cases of mouth-related bad breath.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTON77980320080407 | work=Reuters | title=Scientists find bug responsible for bad breath | date=April 7, 2008}}</ref> Large quantities of naturally-occurring bacteria are often found on the posterior [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsum]] of the tongue, where they are relatively undisturbed by normal activity. This part of the tongue is relatively dry and poorly cleansed, and the convoluted microbial structure of the tongue dorsum provides an ideal [[habitat]] for [[anaerobic bacteria]], which flourish under a continually-forming tongue coating of [[food]] debris, [[epithelium|dead epithelial cells]], [[postnasal drip]] and overlying bacteria, living and dead. When left on the tongue, the [[anaerobic respiration]] of such bacteria can yield either the [[putrefaction|putrescent]] smell of [[indole]], [[skatole]], [[polyamine]]s, or the "rotten egg" smell of [[organosulfur compounds|volatile sulfur compounds]] (VSCs) such as [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[methyl mercaptan]], [[Allyl methyl sulfide]], and [[dimethyl sulfide]].

==== Cleaning the tongue ====
The most widely-known reason to [[Tongue cleaner|clean the tongue]] is for the control of bad breath. Methods used against bad breath, such as mints, mouth sprays, mouthwash or gum, may only temporarily mask the odors created by the bacteria on the tongue, but cannot cure bad breath because they do not remove the source of the bad breath. In order to prevent the production of the sulfur-containing compounds mentioned above, the bacteria on the tongue must be removed, as must the decaying food debris present on the rear areas of the tongue. Most people who clean their tongue use a [[tongue cleaner]] (tongue scraper), or a toothbrush.

=== Mouth ===
There are over 600 types of bacteria found in the average mouth. Many of these can produce high levels of foul odors when incubated in the [[laboratory]]. The odors are produced mainly due to the breakdown of proteins into individual amino acids, followed by the further breakdown of certain amino acids to produce detectable foul gases. For example, the breakdown of [[cysteine]] and [[methionine]] produce [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[methyl mercaptan]], respectively. Volatile sulfur compounds have been shown to be statistically associated with oral malodor levels, and usually decrease following successful treatment.<ref name=rosenberg1>{{cite journal|pmid=8655868|year=1996|last1=Rosenberg|first1=M|title=Clinical assessment of bad breath: Current concepts|volume=127|issue=4|pages=475–82|journal=Journal of the American Dental Association (1939)}}</ref>

Other parts of the mouth may also contribute to the overall odor, but are not as common as the back of the tongue. These locations are, in order of descending prevalence: inter-dental and sub-gingival niches, faulty [[dentistry|dental]] work, food-impaction areas in between the teeth, [[abscess]]es, and unclean [[dentures]].<ref name=scully>Scully C, Rosenberg M. Halitosis. ''Dent Update''. 2003 May;3</ref> Oral based lesions caused by viral infections like Herpes Simplex and HPV may also contribute to bad breath.<ref>[http://www.healthcentre.org.uk/dentistry/oral-herpes.html Oral Herpes Dentists] UK Health Centre</ref>

=== Gum disease ===
There is some controversy over the role of [[periodontitis|periodontal diseases]] in causing bad breath. However, advanced periodontal disease is a common cause of severe halitosis.  Waste products from the anaerobic bacteria growing below the gumline (subgingival) have a foul smell and have been clinically demonstrated to produce a very intense bad breath. Removal of the subgingival calculus (i.e. tartar or hard plaque) and friable tissue has been shown to improve mouth odor considerably.  This is accomplished by subgingival scaling and root planing and irrigation with an antibiotic mouth rinse.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=15752105|year=2005|last1=Stamou|first1=E|last2=Kozlovsky|first2=A|last3=Rosenberg|first3=M|title=Association between oral malodour and periodontal disease-related parameters in a population of 71 Israelis|volume=11 Suppl 1|pages=72–4|doi=10.1111/j.1601-0825.2005.01097.x|journal=Oral diseases}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=8133414|year=1994|last1=Bosy|first1=A|last2=Kulkarni|first2=GV|last3=Rosenberg|first3=M|last4=McCulloch|first4=CA|title=Relationship of oral malodor to periodontitis: Evidence of independence in discrete subpopulations|volume=65|issue=1|pages=37–46|journal=Journal of periodontology}}</ref>

=== Nose ===
The second major source of bad breath is the nose. In this occurrence, the air exiting the [[nostril]]s has a pungent odor that differs from the oral odor. Nasal odor may be due to [[sinus infection]]s or [[foreign bodies]].<ref name=rosenberg1/><ref name=scully/>

=== Tonsils ===
In general, [[putrefaction]] from the [[tonsil]]s is considered a minor cause of bad breath, contributing to some 3–5% of cases. Approximately 7% of the population suffer from small bits of [[calcium|calcified]] matter in tonsillar crypts called [[tonsillolith]]s that smell extremely foul when released and can cause bad breath.<ref name=rosenberg1/><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=15467602|year=2004|last1=Finkelstein|first1=Y|last2=Talmi|first2=YP|last3=Ophir|first3=D|last4=Berger|first4=G|title=Laser cryptolysis for the treatment of halitosis|volume=131|issue=4|pages=372–7|doi=10.1016/j.otohns.2004.02.044|journal=Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery}}</ref>

=== Esophagus ===
The [[lower esophageal sphincter]], which is the valve between the [[stomach]] and the [[esophagus]], may not close properly due to a [[Hiatal Hernia]] or [[GERD]], allowing acid to enter the esophagus and gases escape to the mouth.<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/930029-overview Gastroesophageal Reflux] ''Steven M Schwarz''. 2009 May 13</ref> A [[Zenker's diverticulum]] may also result in halitosis due to aging food retained in the esophagus.

=== Stomach ===
The [[stomach]] is considered by most researchers as a very uncommon source of bad breath (except in [[belching]]). The [[esophagus]] is a closed and collapsed tube, and continuous flow (as opposed to a simple burp) of gas or putrid substances from the [[stomach]] indicates a health problem—such as [[gastroesophageal reflux|reflux]] serious enough to be bringing up stomach contents or a [[fistula]] between the stomach and the esophagus—which will demonstrate more serious manifestations than just foul odor.<ref name=rosenberg0/>

In the case of [[allyl methyl sulfide]] (the byproduct of [[garlic]]'s digestion), odor does not come from the stomach, since it does not get metabolized there.<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/news/19991127/garlic-bad-breath-king Why Garlic Is the Bad Breath King]. Webmd.com (1999-11-27). Retrieved on 2011-10-10.</ref>

=== Systemic diseases ===
There are a few systemic (non-oral) medical conditions that may cause foul breath odor, but these are extremely infrequent in the general population. Such conditions are:<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=12090453|year=2002|last1=Tangerman|first1=A|title=Halitosis in medicine: A review|volume=52 Suppl 3|pages=201–6|journal=International dental journal}}</ref><ref name=tonzetich>{{cite journal|pmid=264535|year=1977|last1=Tonzetich|first1=J|title=Production and origin of oral malodor: A review of mechanisms and methods of analysis|volume=48|issue=1|pages=13–20|journal=Journal of periodontology|doi=10.1902/jop.1977.48.1.13}}</ref>
# [[Fetor hepaticus]]: an example of a rare type of bad breath caused by chronic [[liver failure]].
# [[Lower respiratory tract infection]]s (bronchial and lung infections).
# [[nephritis|Renal infections]] and [[renal failure]].
# [[Carcinoma]].
# [[Trimethylaminuria]] ("fish odor syndrome").
# [[Diabetes mellitus]].
# [[metabolism|Metabolic]] conditions, e.g. resulting in elevated blood [[dimethyl sulfide]] ([[Dimethylsulfidemia]]).<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17716310|year=2007|last1=Tangerman|first1=A|last2=Winkel|first2=EG|title=Intra- and extra-oral halitosis: Finding of a new form of extra-oral blood-borne halitosis caused by dimethyl sulphide|volume=34|issue=9|pages=748–55|doi=10.1111/j.1600-051X.2007.01116.x|journal=Journal of clinical periodontology}}</ref>

Individuals afflicted by the above conditions often show additional, more diagnostically conclusive symptoms than bad breath.

=== Halitophobia (delusion halitosis) ===
One quarter of the patients seeking professional advice on bad breath suffer from a highly exaggerated concern of having bad breath, known as ''halitophobia'', [[delusion]]al halitosis, or as a manifestation of [[Olfactory Reference Syndrome]]. These patients are sure that they have bad breath, although many have not asked anyone for an objective opinion. Halitophobia may severely affect the lives of some 0.5–1.0% of the adult population.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=14699232|year=2003|last1=Lochner|first1=C|last2=Stein|first2=DJ|title=Olfactory reference syndrome: Diagnostic criteria and differential diagnosis|volume=49|issue=4|pages=328–31|journal=Journal of postgraduate medicine}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==

=== Self diagnosis ===
Scientists have long thought that smelling one's own breath odor is often difficult due to [[acclimatization]], although many people with bad breath are able to detect it in others.  Research has suggested that self-evaluation of halitosis is not easy because of preconceived notions of how bad we think it should be. Some people assume that they have bad breath because of bad [[taste]] (metallic, sour, fecal, etc.), however bad taste is considered a poor indicator.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=12821711|year=2003|last1=Tanaka|first1=M|last2=Anguri|first2=H|last3=Nishida|first3=N|last4=Ojima|first4=M|last5=Nagata|first5=H|last6=Shizukuishi|first6=S|title=Reliability of clinical parameters for predicting the outcome of oral malodor treatment|volume=82|issue=7|pages=518–22|journal=Journal of dental research|doi=10.1177/154405910308200706}}</ref><ref name=rosenberg2>{{cite journal|pmid=7560419|year=1995|last1=Rosenberg|first1=M|last2=Kozlovsky|first2=A|last3=Gelernter|first3=I|last4=Cherniak|first4=O|last5=Gabbay|first5=J|last6=Baht|first6=R|last7=Eli|first7=I|title=Self-estimation of oral malodor|volume=74|issue=9|pages=1577–82|journal=Journal of dental research|doi=10.1177/00220345950740091201}}</ref>

For these reasons, the simplest and most effective way to know whether one has bad breath is to ask a trusted adult family member or very close friend ("[[confidant]]"). If the confidant confirms that there is a breath problem, he or she can help determine whether it is coming from the mouth or the nose, and whether a particular treatment is effective or not.<ref name=eli1>{{cite journal|pmid=11367966|year=2001|last1=Eli|first1=I|last2=Baht|first2=R|last3=Koriat|first3=H|last4=Rosenberg|first4=M|title=Self-perception of breath odor|volume=132|issue=5|pages=621–6|journal=Journal of the American Dental Association (1939)}}</ref>

One popular home method to determine the presence of bad breath is to [[licking|lick]] the back of the [[wrist]], let the [[saliva]] dry for a minute or two, and smell the result. This test results in [[overestimate|overestimation]], as concluded from research, and should be avoided.<ref name=rosenberg0/> A better way would be to lightly scrape the posterior back of the tongue with a plastic disposable spoon and to smell the drying residue. Home tests that use a chemical reaction to test for the presence of [[polyamine]]s and sulfur compounds on tongue swabs are now available, but there are few studies showing how well they actually detect the odor. Furthermore, since breath odor changes in intensity throughout the day depending on many factors, multiple testing sessions may be necessary.

=== Professional diagnosis ===
If bad breath is persistent, and all other medical and dental factors have been ruled out, specialized testing and treatment is required. Hundreds of dental offices and commercial breath clinics now claim to diagnose and treat bad breath.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  They often use some of several laboratory methods for diagnosis of bad breath:
# '''[[Halimeter]]''': a portable sulfide monitor used to test for levels of sulfur emissions (to be specific, [[hydrogen sulfide]]) in the mouth air. When used properly, this device can be very effective at determining levels of certain VSC-producing bacteria. However, it has drawbacks in clinical applications. For example, other common sulfides (such as [[mercaptan]]) are not recorded as easily and can be misrepresented in test results. Certain foods such as garlic and onions produce sulfur in the breath for as long as 48 hours and can result in false readings. The Halimeter is also very sensitive to alcohol, so one should avoid drinking alcohol or using alcohol-containing mouthwashes for at least 12 hours prior to being tested. This analog machine loses sensitivity over time and requires periodic recalibration to remain accurate.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=1474479|year=1992|last1=Rosenberg|first1=M|last2=McCulloch|first2=CA|title=Measurement of oral malodor: Current methods and future prospects|volume=63|issue=9|pages=776–82|journal=Journal of periodontology}}</ref>
# '''[[Gas chromatography]]''': portable machines, such as the OralChroma, are currently being introduced.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17416556|year=2007|last1=Van Den Velde|first1=S|last2=Quirynen|first2=M|last3=Van Hee|first3=P|last4=Van Steenberghe|first4=D|title=Halitosis associated volatiles in breath of healthy subjects|volume=853|issue=1–2|pages=54–61|doi=10.1016/j.jchromb.2007.02.048|journal=Journal of chromatography. B, Analytical technologies in the biomedical and life sciences}}</ref> This technology is specifically designed to digitally measure molecular levels of the three major VSCs in a sample of mouth air ([[hydrogen sulfide]], [[methyl mercaptan]], and [[dimethyl sulfide]]). It is accurate in measuring the sulfur components of the breath and produces visual results in graph form via computer interface.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=16805675|year=2006|last1=Murata|first1=T|last2=Rahardjo|first2=A|last3=Fujiyama|first3=Y|last4=Yamaga|first4=T|last5=Hanada|first5=M|last6=Yaegaki|first6=K|last7=Miyazaki|first7=H|title=Development of a compact and simple gas chromatography for oral malodor measurement|volume=77|issue=7|pages=1142–7|doi=10.1902/jop.2006.050388|journal=Journal of periodontology}}</ref>
# '''[[BANA test]]''': this test is directed to find the salivary levels of an [[enzyme]] indicating the presence of certain halitosis-related bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=8006229|year=1994|last1=Kozlovsky|first1=A|last2=Gordon|first2=D|last3=Gelernter|first3=I|last4=Loesche|first4=WJ|last5=Rosenberg|first5=M|title=Correlation between the BANA test and oral malodor parameters|volume=73|issue=5|pages=1036–42|journal=Journal of dental research}}</ref>
# '''[[beta-galactosidase|&beta;-galactosidase]] test''': salivary levels of this enzyme were found to be correlated with oral malodor.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=11876272|year=2002|last1=Sterer|first1=N|last2=Greenstein|first2=RB|last3=Rosenberg|first3=M|title=Beta-galactosidase activity in saliva is associated with oral malodor|volume=81|issue=3|pages=182–5|journal=Journal of dental research|doi=10.1177/154405910208100308}}</ref>

Although such instrumentation and examinations are widely used in breath clinics, the most important measurement of bad breath (the gold standard) is the actual [[inhalation|sniffing]] and scoring of the level and type of the odor carried out by trained experts ("organoleptic measurements"). The level of odor is usually assessed on a six-point intensity scale.<ref name=loesche/><ref name=rosenberg1/><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=14691119|year=2004|last1=Greenman|first1=J|last2=Duffield|first2=J|last3=Spencer|first3=P|last4=Rosenberg|first4=M|last5=Corry|first5=D|last6=Saad|first6=S|last7=Lenton|first7=P|last8=Majerus|first8=G|last9=Nachnani|first9=S|title=Study on the organoleptic intensity scale for measuring oral malodor|volume=83|issue=1|pages=81–5|journal=Journal of dental research|doi=10.1177/154405910408300116}}</ref>

== Management ==
'''Chronic halitosis''' is not well understood by most [[physician]]s and [[dentist]]s, so effective treatment is not always easy to find. The following strategies may be suggested:
# '''[[Tongue cleaner|Gently cleaning the tongue surface]]''' twice daily is the most effective way to keep bad breath in control; that can be achieved  using a tooth brush, [[tongue cleaner]] or [[tongue cleaner|tongue brush/scraper]] to wipe off the bacterial [[biofilm]], debris, and mucus.  An inverted [[teaspoon]] may also do the job. Scraping or otherwise damaging the tongue should be avoided, and scraping of the V-shaped row of [[taste bud]]s found at the extreme back of the tongue should also be avoided. Brushing a small amount of [[antibacterial]] mouth rinse or tongue gel onto the tongue surface will further inhibit bacterial action.<ref name=rosenberg0/><ref name=nachnani0/>
# '''Eating a healthy breakfast''' with rough foods helps clean the very back of the tongue.<ref name=tonzetich/>
# '''[[Chewing gum]]''': Since dry-mouth can increase bacterial buildup and cause or worsen bad breath, chewing sugarless gum can help with the production of [[saliva]], and thereby help to reduce bad breath. Chewing may help particularly when the mouth is dry, or when one cannot perform [[oral hygiene]] procedures after meals (especially those meals rich in [[protein]]). This aids in provision of saliva, which washes away oral bacteria, has antibacterial properties and promotes mechanical activity which helps cleanse the mouth. Some chewing gums contain special anti-odor ingredients. Chewing on [[fennel]] seeds, [[cinnamon]] sticks, [[Mastic (plant resin)|mastic]] gum, or fresh [[parsley]] are common [[folk remedies]].
# '''[[Gargling]]''' right before bedtime with an effective mouthwash (see below). Several types of commercial [[#Mouthwashes|mouthwashes]] have been shown to reduce malodor for hours in [[peer-reviewed]] scientific studies. Mouthwashes may contain active ingredients that are inactivated by the [[soap]] present in most [[toothpaste]]s. Thus it is recommended to refrain from using mouthwash directly after toothbrushing with paste (also see mouthwashes, below).<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=12090451|year=2002|last1=Yaegaki|first1=K|last2=Coil|first2=JM|last3=Kamemizu|first3=T|last4=Miyazaki|first4=H|title=Tongue brushing and mouth rinsing as basic treatment measures for halitosis|volume=52 Suppl 3|pages=192–6|journal=International dental journal}}</ref>
# '''Maintaining proper [[oral hygiene]]''', including daily [[Tongue cleaner|tongue cleaning]], [[Tooth brushing|brushing]], [[flossing]], and periodic visits to [[dentist]]s and [[hygienist]]s. Flossing is particularly important in removing rotting food debris and bacterial plaque from between the teeth, especially at the gumline. [[Dentures]] should be properly cleaned and soaked overnight in antibacterial solution (unless otherwise advised by your dentist).<ref name=scully/>
# '''[[Probiotic]] treatments''', specifically Streptococcus salivarius K12 has been claimed to suppress malodorous bacteria growth, however well designed randomised control clinical trails are needed to assess this.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=16553730|year=2006|last1=Burton|title=A preliminary study of the effect of probiotic Streptococcus salivarius K12 on oral malodour parameters|volume=100|pages=754–64|journal=Journal of Applied Microbiology|display-authors=1|first1=JP|last2=Chilcott|first2=CN|last3=Moore|first3=CJ|last4=Speiser|first4=G|last5=Tagg|first5=JR|issue=4|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2672.2006.02837.x}}</ref> Certainly there is more evidence for mechanical tongue cleansing and to a lesser extent specific antimicrobial mouthwashes.

=== Mouthwashes ===
There has not been a single documented medical case of successfully cured chronic halitosis using any of the currently available mouthwashes. However, a 2008 systematic review determined the efficacy of antibacterial mouthrinses for treating bad breath.<ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com">{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006701.pub2|chapter=Mouthrinses for the treatment of halitosis|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|year=2008|last1=Fedorowicz|first1=Zbys|last2=Aljufairi|first2=Hamad|last3=Nasser|first3=Mona|last4=Outhouse|first4=Trent L|last5=Pedrazzi|first5=Vinícius|editor1-last=Fedorowicz|editor1-first=Zbys}}</ref> [[Mouthwash]]es often contain antibacterial agents including [[cetylpyridinium chloride]], [[chlorhexidine]] (which can cause temporary staining of the teeth),<ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/> [[zinc gluconate]], [[essential oil]]s, and [[chlorine dioxide]].

Other solutions rely on odor eliminators, such as [[oxidizing agent|oxidizers]], to eliminate existing bad breath on a short-term basis.

A new approach for home treatment of bad breath is the use of oil-containing mouthwashes<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=15016031|year=2004|last1=Carvalho|first1=MD|last2=Tabchoury|first2=CM|last3=Cury|first3=JA|last4=Toledo|first4=S|last5=Nogueira-Filho|first5=GR|title=Impact of mouthrinses on morning bad breath in healthy subjects|volume=31|issue=2|pages=85–90|doi=10.1111/j.0303-6979.2004.00452.x|journal=Journal of clinical periodontology}}</ref> and two-phase (oil:water) mouthwashes.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=1552460|year=1992|last1=Rosenberg|first1=M|last2=Gelernter|first2=I|last3=Barki|first3=M|last4=Bar-Ness|first4=R|title=Day-long reduction of oral malodor by a two-phase oil:water mouthrinse as compared to chlorhexidine and placebo rinses|volume=63|issue=1|pages=39–43|journal=Journal of periodontology}}</ref> Essential oils have been found effective in reducing halitosis, and are being used in several commercial mouthwashes.

===Traditional remedies===

According to traditional [[Ayurvedic]] medicine, chewing [[areca nut]] and [[betel]] leaf is a remedy for bad breath.<ref>{{Naveen Pattnaik, The Tree of Life}}</ref> In South Asia, it was a custom to chew areca or betel nut and betel leaf among lovers because of the breath-freshening and stimulant drug properties of the mixture.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Both the nut and the leaf are mild stimulants and can be addictive with repeated use. The betel nut will also cause tooth decay and dye one's teeth bright red when chewed. Both areca nut and betel leaf chewing, however, are recognised risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma (oral cancer).<ref>["Betel chewing 'causes cancer'". Science and Development Network. August 12, 2003.]</ref><ref>[ WHO | IARC Monographs Programme finds betel-quid and areca-nut chewing carcinogenic to humans]</ref>

== Research ==
In 1996, the International Society for Breath Odor Research (ISBOR) was formed to promote multidisciplinary research on all aspects of breath odors. The eighth international conference on breath odor took place in 2009 in Dortmund, Germany.
