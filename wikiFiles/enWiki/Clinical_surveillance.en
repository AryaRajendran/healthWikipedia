'''Clinical surveillance''' (or '''Syndromic surveillance''') refers to the [[surveillance]] (collection and analysis) of health data about a clinical [[syndrome]] that has a significant impact on [[public health]], which is then used to drive decisions about [[health policy]] and [[health education]].  The term applies to surveillance of populations and is distinct from [[Watchful waiting|active surveillance]], which applies to individuals.

==Clinical surveillance==
Techniques of clinical surveillance have been used in particular to study [[infectious diseases]]. Many large institutions, such as the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], have created databases and modern computer systems ([[public health informatics]]) that can track and monitor emerging outbreaks of illnesses such as [[influenza]], [[SARS]], [[HIV]], and even [[bioterrorism]], such as the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] in the United States.

Many regions and countries have their own [[cancer registry]], one function of which is to monitor the incidence of cancers to determine the prevalence and possible causes of these illnesses.

Other illnesses such as one-time events like [[stroke]] and chronic conditions such as [[diabetes]], as well as social problems such as domestic violence, are increasingly being integrated into [[epidemiologic]] databases called disease registries that are being used in [[cost-benefit analysis]] in determining governmental funding for research and prevention.

Many see this health outcomes data as greatly beneficial, but this kind of work is often controversial because many of measures such as [[quality-adjusted life year]]s and [[disability-adjusted life year]]s, which involve quantifying benefit according to subjective concepts such as survival, quality of life, and productivity measures. In addition, [[Civil liberties|civil-libertarians]] believe that without disclosure or provisions to enable a way of opting out of such registries is a violation of both personal civil liberties and the [[Physician-patient privilege|doctor-patient privilege]]. Population-based healthcare is being promoted as registries are integrated, and health outcomes are increasingly being monitored.

Systems that can automate the process of identifying adverse drug events, are currently being used, and are being compared to traditional written reports of such events.<ref name="pmid16622159">{{cite journal| author=Kilbridge PM, Campbell UC, Cozart HB, Mojarrad MG| title=Automated Surveillance for Adverse Drug Events at a Community Hospital and an Academic Medical Center | journal=J Am Med Inform Assoc | year= 2006 Jul–Aug | volume= 13 | issue= 4 | pages= 372–7 | pmid=16622159 | doi=10.1197/jamia.M2069 | pmc=1513675 }}</ref> These systems intersect with the field of medical informatics, and are rapidly becoming adapted by hospitals and endorsed by institutions that oversee healthcare providers (such as [[JCAHO]] in the United States).

==Syndromic surveillance==
{{See also|Disease surveillance}}
Syndromic surveillance is the analysis of medical data to detect or anticipate [[disease]] [[outbreak]]s. According to a [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] definition, "the term 'syndromic surveillance' applies to surveillance using health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response. Though historically syndromic surveillance has been utilized to target investigation of potential cases, its utility for detecting outbreaks associated with [[bioterrorism]] is increasingly being explored by public health officials."<ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/5LKEYsrRT webcitation.org]</ref>

The first indications of disease outbreak or [[bioterrorist]] attack may not be the definitive diagnosis of a physician or a lab.

Using a normal influenza outbreak as an example, once the outbreak begins to affect the population, some people may call in sick for work/school, others may visit their drug store and purchase medicine over the counter, others will visit their doctor's office and other's may have symptoms severe enough that they call the [[emergency telephone number]] or go to an emergency room.

Syndromic surveillance systems monitor data from school absenteeism logs, emergency call systems, hospitals' over-the-counter drug sale records, Internet searches, and other data sources to detect unusual patterns.  When a spike in activity is seen in any of the monitored systems disease epidemiologists and public health professionals are alerted that may be an issue.

An early awareness and response to a bioterrorist attack could save many lives and potentially stop or slow the spread of the outbreak. The most effective syndromic surveillance systems automatically monitor these systems in real-time, do not require individuals to enter separate information (secondary data entry), include advanced analytical tools, aggregate data from multiple systems, across geo-political boundaries and include an automated alerting process.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/epo/dphsi/syndromic.htm United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] ([http://www.webcitation.org/5LKEYsrRT WebCited/cached version])</ref>

A syndromic surveillance system based on search queries was first proposed by [[Gunther Eysenbach]], who began work on such a system in 2004.<ref name="pmid17238340">{{cite journal| author=Eysenbach G| title=Infodemiology: Tracking Flu-Related Searches on the Web for Syndromic Surveillance | journal=AMIA Annu Symp Proc | year= 2006 | volume=  2006| issue=  | pages= 244–8 | pmid=17238340 | pmc=1839505 }}</ref>
Inspired by these early, encouraging experiences, [[Google]] launched [http://www.google.org/flutrends/ Google Flu Trends] in 2008. More [[flu]]-related searches are taken to indicate higher flu activity. The results closely match [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] data, and lead it by - 1–2 weeks. The results appeared in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]].<ref name="pmid19020500">{{cite journal| author=Ginsberg J, Mohebbi MH, Patel RS, Brammer L, Smolinski MS, Brilliant L| title=Detecting influenza epidemics using search engine query data | journal=Nature | year= 2009 | volume= 457 | issue= 7232 | pages= 1012–4| pmid=19020500| doi=10.1038/nature07634}}</ref> Extending [[Google]]'s work researchers from the Intelligent Systems Laboratory ([[University of Bristol]], UK) created [http://geopatterns.enm.bris.ac.uk/epidemics Flu Detector]; an online tool which based on [[Information Retrieval]] and [[Statistical Analysis]] methods uses the content of [[Twitter]] to nowcast flu rates in the UK.<ref name="lamposFlu2010">{{cite conference| author=Lampos V, De Bie T, Cristianini N| title=Flu Detector - Tracking Epidemics on Twitter | conference=ECML PKDD | year=2010 | pages=599–602 | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-15939-8_42 }}</ref>

==Influenzanet==
[[Influenzanet]] is a syndromic surveillance system based on voluntary reports of symptoms via the internet. Residents of the participant countries are invited to provide regular reports on the presence or absence of flu related symptoms. The system has been in place and running since 2003 in the Netherlands and Belgium. The success of this first initiative led to the implementation of Gripenet in Portugal in 2005 followed by Italy in 2008 and Brasil, Mexico, and the United Kingdom in 2009.

==Laboratory-based surveillance==
Some conditions, especially chronic diseases such as [[diabetes mellitus]], are supposed to be routinely managed with frequent laboratory measurements. Since many laboratory results, at least in Europe and the US, are automatically processed by computerized laboratory information systems, the results are relatively easy to inexpensively collate in special purpose databases or disease registries.  Unlike most syndromic surveillance systems, in which each record is assumed to be independent of the others, laboratory data in chronic conditions can be theoretically linked together at the individual patient level. If patient identifiers can be matched, a chronological record of each patient's laboratory results can be analyzed as well as aggregated to the population level.

Laboratory registries allow for the analysis of the incidence and prevalence of the target condition as well as trends in the level of control. For instance, an NIH-funded program called the [http://www.vermedx.com Vermedx Diabetes Information System] maintained a registry of laboratory values of diabetic adults in Vermont and northern New York State in the US with several years of laboratory results on thousands of patients.<ref>MacLean CD, Littenberg B, Gagnon M. Diabetes Decision Support: Initial Experience with the Vermont Diabetes Information System in Community Primary Care. ''Am J Pub Health'' 2006; 96:593-595. http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/abstract/96/4/593</ref> The data included measures of [[blood sugar]] control ([[Glycosylated hemoglobin|glycosolated hemoglobin A1C]]), [[cholesterol]], and kidney function (serum [[creatinine]] and urine protein), and were used to monitor the quality of care at the patient, practice, and population levels.  Since the data contained each patient's name and address, the system was also used to communicate directly with patients when the laboratory data indicated the need for attention. Out of control test results generated a letter to the patient suggesting they take action with their medical provider. Tests that were overdue generated reminders to have testing performed. The system also generated reminders and alerts with guideline-based advice for the practice as well as a periodic roster of each provider's patients and a report card summarizing the health status of the population. Clinical and economic evaluations of the system, including a large randomized clinical trial, demonstrated improvements in adherence to practice guidelines and reductions in the need for emergency room and hospital services as well as total costs per patient.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Littenberg|first=B|coauthors=MacLean, CD, Zygarowski, K, Drapola, BH, Duncan, JA, Frank, CR|title=The Vermedx Diabetes Information System reduces healthcare utilization.|journal=The American journal of managed care|date=2009 Mar|year=2009|volume=15|issue=3|pages=166–70|pmid=19298097|url=http://www.ajmc.com/issue/managed-care/2009/2009-02-vol15-n3/AJMC_09Mar_Littenberg166to170}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Maclean|first=CD|coauthors=Gagnon, M, Callas, P, Littenberg, B|title=The Vermont diabetes information system: a cluster randomized trial of a population based decision support system.|journal=Journal of general internal medicine|date=2009 Dec|volume=24|issue=12|pages=1303–10|pmid=19862578|doi=10.1007/s11606-009-1147-x|pmc=2787948}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=S|coauthors=Maclean, CD, Littenberg, B|title=The effect of the Vermont Diabetes Information System on inpatient and emergency room use: results from a randomized trial.|journal=Health outcomes research in medicine|date=2010 Jul|volume=1|issue=1|pages=e61-e66|pmid=20975923|doi=10.1016/j.ehrm.2010.03.002|pmc=2958673}}</ref> The system has been commercialized and distributed to physicians, insurers, employers and others responsible for the care of chronically ill patients. It is now being expanded to other conditions such as [[chronic kidney disease]].

A similar system, [http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/diabetes/diabetes-nycar.shtml The New York City A1C Registry], is in used to monitor the estimated 600,000 diabetic patients in [[New York City]], although unlike the Vermont Diabetes Information System, there are no provisions for patients to have their data excluded from the NYC database. The [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene|NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene]] has linked additional patient services to the registry such as health information and improved access to health care services.  As of early 2012, the registry contains over 10 million test results on 3.6 million individuals. Although intended to improve health outcomes and reduce the incidence of the complications of diabetes,<ref>[http://ajph.aphapublications.org/cgi/content/extract/98/9/1543 Frieden, Thomas R; "Letter: New York City's Diabetes Reporting System Helps Patients and their Physicians"; ''American Journal of Public Health''; July 16, 2006.]</ref> a formal evaluation has not yet been done.

In May 2008, the City Council of [[San Antonio, Texas]] approved the deployment of an A1C registry for [[Bexar County]]. Authorized by the Texas Legislature and the state Health Department, the [http://www.sanantonio.gov/health/ San Antonio Metropolitan Health District] implemented the registry which drew results from all the major clinical laboratories in San Antonio. The program was discontinued in 2010 for lack of funds.

Laboratory surveillance differs from population-wide surveillance in that in that it can only monitor patients who are already receiving medical treatment and therefore having lab tests done. For this reason, it does not identify patients who have never been tested. Therefore, it is more suitable for quality management and care improvement than for epidemiological monitoring of an entire population or catchment area.
