'''Population health''' has been defined as “the health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group.”<ref>Kindig D, Stoddart G. [http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/93/3/380.pdf What is population health?] ''American Journal of Public Health'' 2003 Mar;93(3):380-3. Retrieved 2008-10-12.</ref> It is an approach to [[health]] that aims to improve the health of an entire population. One major step in achieving this aim is to reduce health inequities among population groups. Population health seeks to step beyond the individual-level focus of mainstream [[medicine]] and to complement the organized efforts of [[public health]] by addressing a broader range of factors that impact health on a population-level, such as environment, social structure, resource distribution, etc. One important theme in population health is the importance of [[social determinants of health]] and the relatively minor impact that medicine and healthcare have on improving health overall.

From a population health perspective, health has been defined not simply as a state free from disease but as "the capacity of people to adapt to, respond to, or control life's challenges and changes".<ref>Frankish, CJ et al. [http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ph-sp/impact-repercussions/hiatp2.php "Health Impact Assessment as a Tool for Population Health Promotion and Public Policy."] Vancouver: Institute of Health Promotion Research, University of British Columbia, 1996.

==The role of economic inequality==

Recently, there has been increasing interest from [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] on the subject of [[economic inequality]] and its relation to the health of populations. There is a very robust correlation between [[Social status|socioeconomic status]] and health. This correlation suggests that it is not only the poor who tend to be sick when everyone else is healthy,  [[heart disease]], [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]], [[type 2 diabetes]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], certain types of [[cancer]], and [[premature aging]].
Despite the reality of the SES Gradient, there is debate as to its cause. A number of researchers (A. Leigh, C. Jencks, A. Clarkwest - see also Russell Sage working papers) see a definite link between economic status and mortality due to the greater economic resources of the better-off, but they find little correlation due to [[social status]] differences. 

Other researchers such as [[Richard G. Wilkinson]], J. Lynch, and G.A. Kaplan have found that socioeconomic status strongly affects health even when controlling for economic resources and access to health care. Most famous for linking social status with health are the [[Whitehall Study|Whitehall studies]] - a series of studies conducted on [[civil servants]] in [[London]]. The studies found that, despite the fact that all civil servants in England have the same access to health care, there was a strong correlation between social status and health. The studies found that this relationship stayed strong even when controlling for health-affecting habits such as [[exercise]], [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] and [[Alcoholic beverage|drinking]]. Furthermore, it has been noted that no amount of medical attention will help decrease the likelihood of someone getting [[type 1 diabetes]] or [[rheumatoid arthritis]] - yet both are more common among populations with lower socioeconomic status. Lastly, it has been found that amongst the wealthiest quarter of countries on earth (a set stretching from [[Luxembourg]] to [[Slovakia]]) there is no relation between a country's wealth and general population health {{ref|sci_amer_dec_2005}} - suggesting that past a certain level, absolute levels of wealth have little impact on population health, but relative levels within a country do.
The concept of [[psychosocial stress]] attempts to explain how psychosocial phenomenon such as [[Social status|status]] and [[social stratification]] can lead to the many diseases associated with the [[SES gradient]]. Higher levels of economic inequality tend to intensify social hierarchies and generally degrades the quality of social relations - leading to greater levels of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] and stress related diseases. Richard Wilkinson found this to be true not only for the poorest members of society, but also for the wealthiest. Economic inequality is bad for everyone's health.''' 
Inequality does not only affect the health of human populations. David H. Abbott at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center found that among many primate species, less egalitarian social structures correlated with higher levels of stress hormones among socially subordinate individuals. Research by [[Robert Sapolsky]] of [[Stanford University]] provides similar findings.

==The importance of family planning programs==
[[Family planning]] programs (including [[Birth control|contraceptives]], [[sex education|sexuality education]], and promotion of [[safe sex]]) play a major role in population health. Family planning is one of the most highly cost-effective interventions in medicine.<ref name=Tsui>{{cite journal |author=Tsui AO, McDonald-Mosley R, Burke AE |title=Family planning and the burden of unintended pregnancies |journal=Epidemiol Rev |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=152–74 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20570955 |pmc=3115338 |doi=10.1093/epirev/mxq012 |url= | quote=International studies confirm that family planning is among the most cost-effective of all health interventions (80, 81).  The cost savings stem from a reduction in unintended pregnancy, as well as a reduction in transmission of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.}}</ref><!-- page 170 -->  Family planning saves lives and money by reducing [[unintended pregnancy]] and the transmission of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s.<ref name=Tsui />

==Population health management (PHM)==
One method to improve population health is population health management (PHM), which has been defined as “the technical field of endeavor which utilizes a variety of individual, organizational and cultural interventions to help improve the [[morbidity]] patterns (i.e., the illness and injury burden) and the health care use behavior of defined populations”.<ref>Hillman, Michael. [http://waysandmeans.house.gov/Legacy/health/107cong/4-16-02/4-16hill.htm Testimony before the Subcommittee on Health of the House Committee on Ways and Means, hearing on promoting disease management in Medicare.] 2002-04-16. Retrieved 2008-10-12.</ref> PHM is distinguished from [[Disease management (health)|disease management]] by including more [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] conditions and diseases, by use of "a single point of contact and coordination," and by "[[predictive modeling]] across multiple clinical conditions".<ref>Howe, Rufus, and Christopher Spence. [http://www.healthways.com/assets/0/98/E4CDDEDB-5004-4E74-A5C9-E1973F5ABC05.pdf Population health management: Healthways' PopWorks.]  ''HCT Project'' 2004-07-17, volume 2, chapter 5, pages 291-297. Retrieved 2008-10-12.</ref> PHM is considered broader than disease management in that it also includes "intensive care management for individuals at the highest level of risk" and "personal health management... for those at lower levels of predicted health risk.".<ref>Coughlin JF, Pope J, Leedle BR. [http://web.mit.edu/agelab/news_events/pdfs/home.health.care.pdf Old age, new technology, and future innovations in disease management and home health care.] ''Home Health Care Management & Practice'' 2006 Apr;18(3):196-207.
