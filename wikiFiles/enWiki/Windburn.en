'''Windburn''' is [[sunburn]] accelerated by the effects of [[wind]] removing the UV-filtering thin layer of [[lipid]]s from the [[skin]] and irritation caused by the wind.<ref name="howstuffworks">http://health.howstuffworks.com/skin-care/problems/medical/windburn.htm</ref> Though formerly thought to be solely the result of wind, the condition has been demonstrated to be the result of sun exposure aggravated by exposure to wind.<ref name=CrewAndWhittle>http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,848654,00.html</ref> Thus [[sunburn#Treatment|treatment]] and [[sunburn#Protection|prevention]] of windburn and sunburn are basically identical.
