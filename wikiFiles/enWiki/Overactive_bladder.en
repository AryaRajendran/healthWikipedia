'''Overactive bladder''' (OAB) is a [[urological]] condition defined by a set of symptoms: urgency, with or without [[Urinary incontinence#Urge_incontinence_or_Hypertonic|urge incontinence]], usually with frequency and [[nocturia]].  Frequency is usually defined as urinating more than 8 times a day.  The [[International Continence Society]] is responsible for this definition.  There exists, however, some controversy over the use of this term because these symptoms taken in isolation may overlap with those of other [[bladder]] conditions, including [[interstitial cystitis]], or rarely even [[bladder tumour]]s.

==Causes==
The [[etiology]] of OAB is unclear, and indeed there may be multiple possible causes.<ref>Sacco E. [Physiopathology of overactive bladder syndrome]. Urologia. 2012;79(1):24-35. doi: 10.5301/RU.2012.8972.</ref> It is often associated with overactivity of the [[Detrusor urinae muscle]], a pattern of bladder muscle contraction observed during [[Urodynamic testing|urodynamics]].<ref name="Treatment">{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17908830|last1=Sussmann|first1=DO|title=Overactive bladder: treatment options in primary care medicine.| journal= The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association|year=2007 |month= September|volume=107|issue=9|pages=379–385|pmid=17908830}}</ref> Treatments for OAB are usually synonymous with treatments for detrusor overactivity. OAB is distinct from [[Urinary incontinence#Stress_incontinence|stress urinary incontinence]], but when they occur together, the condition is usually known as mixed incontinence.

Earlier reports estimated that about one in six adults in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] had OAB.<ref name="NOBLE survey">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s00345-002-0301-4 | last1 = Stewart | first1 = WF | last2 = Van Rooyen | first2 = JB | last3 = Cundiff | first3 = GW | last4 = Abrams | first4 = P | last5 = Herzog | first5 = AR | last6 = Corey | first6 = R | last7 = Hunt | first7 = TL | last8 = Wein | first8 = AJ | title = Prevalence and burden of overactive bladder in the United States | journal = [[World Journal of Urology]] | year = 2003 | month = May | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 327–336 }}</ref><ref name="Milsom et al. 2001">{{cite journal | last1 = Milsom | first1 = I | last2 = Abrams | first2 = P | last3 = Cardozo | first3 = L | last4 = Roberts | first4 = RG | last5 = Thuroff | first5 = J | last6 = Wein | first6 = AJ | title = How widespread are the symptoms of an overactive bladder and how are they managed?

However, a recent Finnish population-based survey<ref name="Tikkinen et al. 2007">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000195 | last1 = Tikkinen | first1 = KAO | last2 = Tammela | first2 = TLJ | last3 = Rissanen | first3 = AM | last4 = Valpas | first4 = A | last5 = Huhtala | first5 = H | last6 = Auvinen | first6 = A | title = Is the Prevalence of Overactive Bladder Overestimated?

It is suspected, then, that OAB affects approximately half the number of individuals as earlier reported.<ref name="Tikkinen et al. 2007"/>

In 2008, researchers found that simulating the condition in rats caused overactivation of their [[locus coeruleus]], and it is thought this could cause [[anxiety]] and [[dysomnia|disrupted sleep]] in humans.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = [[New Scientist]] | date = 23 July 2008 | issue = 2666 | page = 12 | url = http://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/mg19926664.300-overactive-bladders-play-with-the-mind.html | title = Overactive bladders play with the mind }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of OAB is made primarily by ruling out other causes of overactivity of the bladder such as an infection or bladder tumor.<ref name="Treatment"/> The diagnosis is confirmed by [[cystometry]]. Additionally, urine culture may be done to rule out infection. The frequency/volume chart may be maintained and [[cystourethroscopy]] may be done to exclude tumor and [[kidney stone]]s.

==Treatment==
Treatment for OAB includes nonpharmacologic methods such as lifestyle modification (fluid restriction, avoidance of [[caffeine]]), bladder retraining or may involve the use of pharmaceutical agents such as [[antimuscarinic]] drugs (e.g., [[darifenacin]], [[hyoscyamine]], [[oxybutynin]], [[tolterodine]], [[solifenacin]], [[trospium]], [[fesoterodine]]).<ref name="Treatment"/> [[beta-3 adrenergic receptor|β3 adrenergic receptor]] agonists (e.g., [[mirabegron]]),<ref>Sacco E, Bientinesi R.
