'''Marie-Guillaume-Alphonse Devergie''' (February 15, 1798 – October 2, 1879) was a French [[dermatologist]] born in [[Paris]].

In 1834 he became a physician of Parisian hospitals (''médecin des hôpitaux''), and in 1840 succeeded [[Laurent-Théodore Biett]] (1781–1840) at the [[Hôpital Saint-Louis]], where he practiced medicine until his retirement. During his career he was also associated with the Hôpitaux [[Bicêtre Hospital|Bicêtre]] and St. Antoine. In 1874 he was elected president of the ''[[Académie de Médecine]]''.

In 1856 Devergie was the first to describe a chronic [[papulosquamous disorder]] known as [[pityriasis rubra pilaris]], also referred to as "Devergie's disease",<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21410618 Therapeutic hotline. Treatment of pityriasis rubra pilaris with etanercept.] Dermatol Ther. 2011 Mar-Apr;24(2):285-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1529-8019.2011.01404.x.</ref> a term introduced by [[Ernest Henri Besnier]] (1831-1909) in 1889.<ref>[http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/947.html Devergie's disease] @ [[Who Named It]]</ref>

In 1854 he published an important [[textbook]] on skin diseases titled ''Traité pratique des maladies de la peau''.

When he retired, Devergie donated his collection of dermatological [[watercolor]]s to the Parisian hospital administration. This donation was instrumental in creation of a medical museum at [[Hôpital Saint-Louis]].<ref>[http://www.bium.univ-paris5.fr/sfhd/biographies/devergie_eng.htm bium.univ-paris5.fr] (biographical information)</ref>

Devergie was one of the founders of [[forensic medicine]] in France, and was co-publisher of the journal ''Annales d’hygiène publique et de médecine légale'' with [[Mathieu Orfila]] (1787–1853), [[Gabriel Andral]] (1797–1876), [[Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol]] (1772–1840) and [[François Leuret]] (1797–1851). In 1836 he published a two-volume book on judicial medicine called ''Medecine legale, theorique et pratique''.
