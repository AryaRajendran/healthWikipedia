The '''ME Association''' is a British [[Charitable organization|charity]] that provides information to patients and raises funds for research into ME and [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].

==Activities==
The name of the organisation is a reference to [[myalgic encephalopathy]] (or myalgic encephalomyelitis) which is a distinct clinical descriptor of a disease, ICD-10, G 93.3.<ref name="who-g93">{{cite web | author=WHO | publisher=World Health Organisation | title=Postviral fatigue syndrome | url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/G93.3 | work=ICD-10 - Version 2010 | date= | accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref>
While the disease gives rise to many of the group of symptoms often described as CFS, CFS is not a diagnosis of anything. There are many diseases and conditions which can cause these symptoms.
ME has a highly distinctive symptom, post-exertional neuroimmune exhaustion, also sometimes described as post-exertional malaise, which distinguishes it clearly from other conditions.

The organisation informs its members of developments affecting sufferers, carers, family and friends, via its quarterly magazine ME Essential, its website, and other communication media. It promotes its members' interests in medical and political arenas, and in the media. It produces advice on specific aspects of the illness and its effect on sufferers, particularly in its clinical guidance booklet, 'ME/CFS/PVFS : An exploration of the key clinical issues', which informs both practitioners and patients.

The telephone helpline MEConnect is available for advice and support between 10.00 and 12.00 am, 2.00 and 4.00 pm and 7.00 and 9.00 pm, every day of the year, on 0844 576 5326.<ref group="notes" name="costs">Warning: premium rate telephone number costs 5p/min to 15p/min from landlines, 20p/min to 45p/min from mobiles (tariff "g6" with 4.255p/min revenue-share).</ref>

The organisation is a charitable company and members subscribe annually at a cost of Â£18.
