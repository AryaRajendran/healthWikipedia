'''Paroxysmal kinesigenic choreathetosis''' '''(PKC)''' also called '''Paroxysmal Kinesigenic Dyskinesia''' '''(PKD)''' is a [[Hyperkinesia|hyperkinetic]] [[movement disorder]] characterized by attacks of involuntary movements, which are triggered by sudden voluntary movements. The number of attacks can increase during puberty and decrease in a person’s 20's to 30's. Involuntary movements can take many forms such as ballism, [[Choreia|chorea]] or [[dystonia]] and usually only affect one side of the body or one limb in particular. This rare disorder only affects about 1 in 150,000 people<ref name= khan>{{Cite PMID|20873453|noedit}}</ref> with PKD accounting for 86.8% of all the types of [[paroxysmal dyskinesia]]s<ref name= analyzing>{{Cite PMID|21448393|noedit}}</ref> and occurs more often in males than females. There are two types of PKD, primary and secondary. Primary PKD can be further broken down into familial and sporadic. Familial PKD, which means the individual has a family history of the disorder, is more common, but sporadic cases are also seen.<ref name= bruno>{{Cite PMID|15623687|noedit}}</ref> Secondary PKD can be caused by many other medical conditions such as [[Multiple sclerosis|multiple sclerosis (MS)]], [[stroke]], [[pseudohypoparathyroidism]],<ref>{{Cite PMID|20682207|noedit}}</ref> [[Hypocalcaemia|hypocalcemia]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[hyperglycemia]],<ref name= bruno /> [[central nervous system]] trauma, or [[peripheral nervous system]] trauma.<ref name= mehta/> PKD has also been linked with [[infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis]] (ICCA) syndrme, in which patients have [[Normal human body temperature|afebrile]] seizures during infancy ([[benign familial infantile epilepsy]]) and then develop paroxysmal choreoathetosis later in life.<ref name= weber>{{Cite PMID|19348709|noedit}}</ref> This phenomenon is actually quite common, with about 42% of individuals with PKD reporting a history of afebrile seizures as a child.<ref name= weber/>

==History of Discovery==
A movement disorder similar to PKD was first mentioned in research literature in 1940 by Mount and Reback. They described a disorder consisting of attacks of involuntary movements but unlike PKD, the attacks lasted minutes to hours and were found to be caused by alcohol or caffeine intake.<ref name= bhatia/> They named it paroxysmal dystonic choreoathetosis. Kertesz later described another new movement disorder in 1967. He described a disorder that was induced by sudden movements, and responded to [[anticonvulsant]]s, naming it paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis. Finally in a review in 1995 Demirkiran and [[Joseph Jankovic|Jankovic]] stated the disease should be called paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia instead, pointing out that the attacks could manifest as any form of dyskinesia, not just choreoathetosis.<ref name=bhatia>{{Cite PMID|21626559|noedit}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia is diagnosed using a strict set of guidelines. These criteria were studied and confirmed by Bruno et al. in a study of 121 individuals with PKD.<ref name= bruno /> The age at onset is between 1 and 20 years old. The attacks of involuntary movements last less than one minute and have a known trigger, usually a sudden voluntary movement. For example, if a PKD patient stands up or begins walking after being sedentary for a period of time, or a person goes from a walk to a run, it can trigger an attack. Persons with PKD do not lose consciousness during attacks and have a full memory of the entire attack. Lastly, people with the disorder have a good response to medication and are usually prescribed [[anticonvulsant]]s. The study also found that patients with familial PKD exhibit symptoms that follow the diagnostic criteria closely, while sporadic PKD individuals may deviate slightly.<ref name= mehta/> Prior to criteria for diagnosis being set out, many patients with PKD were often diagnosed with some form of [[epilepsy]]. Unlike epilepsy, patients with PKD do not lose consciousness during attacks. In addition, individuals with PKD generally have normal [[Postictal state|postictal]] neurologic exams. However, many patients also experience an [[Aura (symptom)|aura]], similar to those experienced with epilepsy, preceding their attacks. Some patients describe it as a [[Paresthesia|tingling sensation]] in the affected limb or “butterflies in their stomach.” Some individuals also have precipitants, such as stress and anxiety that make it more likely for attacks to occur.    
<br />
The above diagnostic criteria also set PKD apart from the other paroxysmal dyskinesias, which include [[paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia]] (PNKD) and [[Paroxysmal exercise-induced dystonia|paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia]] (PED).  While PKD attacks last less than one minute, PNKD attacks last a few minutes to a few hours, and as the name suggests, the attacks do not occur because of a sudden voluntary movement like PKD.<ref name= mehta>{{Cite doi|10.1007/s11940-009-0020-x|noedit}}</ref> Additionally, PKD can almost always be managed with drug therapy, while PNKD is not as responsive to anticonvulsants. PED, on the other hand, separates itself from PKD in that it is caused by prolonged exercise. Attacks from PED will cease soon after exercise is stopped.<ref name= mehta />

==Treatment==
Almost all patients respond positively to antiepileptic (anticonvulsant) drugs. One of the drugs most often mentioned in the literature is carbamazepine, and is the most widely used drug for treating PKD. Other anticonvulsants like valproic acid, fenytoin and clonazepam are common alternatives. Other categories of drugs have also been used, such as [[dopamine]] affecting drugs like [[L-DOPA|Levodopa]] or [[Tetrabenazine]].<ref name= mehta /> Individuals with the disorder can also modify their behavior to lessen their attacks without the influence of drug therapy. For example, decreasing stress to avoid precipitants can help patients decrease the number of attacks. In addition, avoiding any sudden movements can also prevent an attack. In order to prevent an attack, some individuals use their auras as a warning, while others purposefully perform slow gestures or movements prior to a triggering movement.<ref name= analyzing /> Many, if not most, individuals end up growing out of the attacks with age, even without medicinal therapy, but some patients will go back to having attacks after a period of remission.<ref name= bruno /> In regards to secondary PKD, treatment of the primary condition can lessen the PKD attacks in those individuals.<ref name= mehta />

==Pathophysiology==
Currently the [[pathophysiology]] of PKD is not fully explained. A few mechanisms have been suggested thus far:
#[[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] dysregulation
#Abnormal breakdown of [[dopamine]] in the [[basal ganglia]]
#Dysfunction of the [[substantia nigra]]<ref name = joo>{{Cite PMID|15948007|noedit}}</ref>
#A form of epilepsy<ref name=analyzing />
Multiple methods are being used to study the potential brain abnormalities of individuals with PKD compared with “normal” individuals.  These methods include [[Single-photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]] studies, [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] studies, and [[diffusion tensor imaging]]. The main problem with many of the studies concerned with the pathophysiology of the disorder is the small sample size. Because the studies normally only include about 7-10 patients with PKD, the results cannot be generalized to the entire population of patients. However, the studies do bring up possibilities for further study.

===SPECT Studies===
In a study by Joo et al., the researchers performed interictal studies, meaning they scanned the patient's brain between attacks to find an underlying abnormality, rather than ictal scans, which look at the abnormalities that present themselves during an attack.<ref name= joo /> The researchers found interictally decreased cerebral blood flow in the [[Anatomical terms of location#Anterior and posterior|posterior]] parts of the [[Caudate nucleus|bilateral caudate nucleus]].<ref name= joo/> However, the literature does state that although this could be a cause of PKD, it could also be a result of PKD.<ref name= joo /> Another SPECT study showed an increase in the cerebral blood flow in the [[Thalamus|left posterior thalamus]] in a PKD patient during an attack.<ref name= shirane>{{Cite doi|10.1136/jnnp.71.3.408|noedit}}</ref> The researchers also subtracted the ictal from the postictal scans, and saw increased blood flow in the thalamus. They ultimately suggested that hyperactive blood flow in this area could be causing the pathophysiology of PKD. This study, however, was only performed on one patient, and would need to be replicated many more times in order to be generalized to the population of PKD patients. Other SPECT studies have been cited showing hyperactivity in the basal ganglia.<ref name= zhou1>{{Cite PMID|20012544|noedit}}</ref>

===fMRI Studies===
In a study by Zhou et al.,<ref name=hyper>{{Cite PMID|20629125|noedit}}</ref> the researchers performed fMRI studies on PKD patients, and analyzed the differences between the amplitude low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of the patients. They found that the [[Postcentral gyrus|left postcentral gyrus]] and the [[Putamen|bilateral putamen]] had increased ALFF in PKD patients.<ref name= hyper/> The researchers concluded that the hyperactivity in these regions suggested that there is a dysfunction in the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit in PKD. This circuit is part of the motor control circuit in the brain, making it a reasonable place for abnormality in a movement disorder, but again, researchers are still unsure of the role these differences they found play in the disease pathology.

===Diffusion Tensor Imaging===
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) displays physical alterations in the brain that may not be seen on regular [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]].<ref name= zhou1 /> In one study researchers found that some of the patients had abnormalities in their thalamus. However, this does not prove that all patients have abnormalities in their thalamus. Other cases are cited, including a patient who developed a similar paroxysmal dyskinesia after a thalamic [[infarction]],<ref name=zhou1 /> implicating that an abnormality in the thalamus of individuals could contribute to PKD. It is not fully known, however, what role a thalamic abnormality plays in the disease pathophysiology.

==Genetics of Disease==
Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia has been shown to be inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] fashion. In 2011, the [[PRRT2]] gene on chromosome 16 was identified as the cause of the disease.<ref name=gene>{{Cite pmid|22101681|noedit}}</ref> The researchers looked at the genetics of eight families with strong histories of PKD. They employed [[Full genome sequencing|whole genome sequencing]], along with [[DNA sequencing#Chain-termination methods|Sanger]] sequencing to identify the gene that was mutated in these families. The mutations in this gene included a [[nonsense mutation]] identified in the [[genome]] of one family and an [[Insertion (genetics)|insertion mutation]] identified in the genome of another family.<ref name=wang>{{cite pmid|22120146|noedit}}</ref>   The researchers then confirmed this gene as the cause of PKD when it was not mutated in the genome of 1000 [[Scientific control|control]] patients.<ref name= gene/> Researchers found PRRT2 mutations in 10 of 29 sporadic cases affected with PKC, thus suggests PRRT2 is the gene mutated in a subset of PKC and PKC is genetically heterogeneous.<ref>Li J, Zhu X, Wang X et al. J Med Genet. 2012 Feb;49(2):76-8. Epub 2011 Nov 30. Targeted genomic sequencing identifies PRRT2 mutations as a cause of paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis.</ref> The mechanism of how PRRT2 causes PKD still requires further investigation. However, researchers suggest it may have to do with PRRT2's expression in the basal ganglia, and the expression of an associated protein, [[SNAP25]], in the basal ganglia as well.<ref name= wang/>
