'''Renal glycosuria''', also known as '''renal glucosuria''', is a rare condition in which the simple [[sugar]] [[glucose]] is excreted in the urine<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 14174800 | pmc=1932305 | volume=16 | title=THE INHERITANCE OF RENAL GLYCOSURIA | year=1964 | month=June | author=KHACHADURIAN AK, KHACHADURIAN LA | journal=Am. J. Hum. Genet. | pages=189â€“94}}</ref> despite normal or low blood glucose levels.  With normal kidney (renal) function, glucose is excreted in the urine only when there are abnormally elevated levels of glucose in the blood.  However, in those with renal glycosuria, glucose is abnormally elevated in the urine due to improper functioning of the renal tubules, which are primary components of [[nephron]]s, the [[filter (chemistry)|filter]]ing units of the kidneys.

==Diagnosis==
A doctor normally can diagnose renal glycosuria when a routine urine test ([[Urinalysis]]) detects glucose in the urine, while a blood test indicates that the blood glucose level is normal.

==Presentation==
In most affected individuals, the condition causes no apparent [[symptom]]s (asymptomatic) or serious effects.  When renal glycosuria occurs as an isolated finding with otherwise normal kidney function, the condition is thought to be inherited as an autosomal [[recessive trait]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

==Genetics==
It is associated with [[SLC5A2]], coding the [[sodium glucose cotransporter 2]].
