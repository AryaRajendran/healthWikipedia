'''PAPA syndrome''' is an acronym for [[pyogenic]] [[arthritis]], [[pyoderma gangrenosum]] and [[acne]]. It is a rare [[genetic disorder]] characterised by its effects on [[skin]] and [[joints]].<ref>Lindor NM, Arsenault TM, Solomon H, Seidman CE, McEvoy MT. A new autosomal dominant disorder of pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne: PAPA Syndrome. Mayo Clin Proc 1997; 72:611-5.</ref><ref>McDermott MF, Aksentijevich I. The Autoinflammatory syndromes. Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol 2002; 2(6): 511-516.</ref>

== Genetics ==
[[Image:Autosomal dominant - en.svg|thumb|right|PAPA syndrome is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] pattern.]]
PAPA syndrome is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] fashion, which means that if one parent is affected, there is a 100% chance that a child will inherit the disease from an homozygous affected parent, and a 50% chance that a
child will inherit the disease from an affected heterozygous parent.

Recently the responsible gene has been identified on [[Chromosome 15]].<ref>Yeon HB, Lindor HM, Seidman JG, Seidman CE et al.Pyogenic Arthritis, Pyoderma Gangrenosum, and Acne Syndrome Maps to Chromosome 15q. Am J Hum Genet 2000; 66:1443-8.</ref><ref>Lindor NM, Arsenault TM, Solomon H, Seidman CE, McEvoy MT. A new autosomal dominant disorder of pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne: PAPA Syndrome. Mayo Clin Proc 1997; 72:611-5.</ref><ref>Wise CA, Bennett LB, Pascual V, Gillum JD, Bowcock AM. Localization of a gene for familial recurrent arthritis. Arthritis Rheum. 2000 Sep; 43(9):2041-5.</ref> Two mutations have been found in a protein called [[CD2 binding protein 1]] ([[CD2BP1]]).<ref>Wise CA, Gillum JD, Seidman CE, Lindor NM, Veile R, Bashiardes S, Lovett M. Mutations in CD2BP1 disrupt binding to PTP PEST and are responsible for PAPA syndrome, an autoinflammatory disorder. Hum Mol Genet. 2002 Apr 15; 11(8): 961-9</ref>
This protein is part of an inflammatory pathway associated with other [[autoinflammatory disease]]s such as [[familial Mediterranean fever]], [[Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with recurrent fever]], [[Muckle-Wells syndrome]], [[neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease]] and [[familial cold urticaria]].<ref>Shoham NG, Centola M, Mansfield E, Hull KM, Wood G, Wise CA, Kastner DL. Pyrin binds the PSTPIP1/CD2BP1 protein, defining familial Mediterranean fever and PAPA syndrome as disorders in the same pathway. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2003 Nov 11; 100(23): 13501-6.</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Clinical features along with the [[Family history|familial tendency]] may be enough to make a diagnosis. Genetic testing may also be used.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

== Clinical Features ==
It usually begins with [[arthritis]] at a young age, with the [[skin]] changes more prominent from the time of [[puberty]].

The [[arthritis]] is the predominant feature, noted by its juvenile onset and destructive course. Individuals often recall episodes of arthritis precipitated by a [[Physical trauma|trauma]]tic event. With repeated episodes the joints become damaged with multiple [[joint replacement]]s required. Hopefully with improved treatment options the damage will be limited in new cases.

[[Pyoderma gangrenosum]] is variably expressed, which means that it is not always present in all individuals with the disease. It presents as poorly healing [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcers]] with undermined edges. [[Pathergy test|Pathergy]] is an important feature (this term refers to the tendency of ulcers to arise at points of injury).  There are reports of lesions developing at the site of a [[joint replacement]] [[wound]], [[central venous line]] and [[intravenous drip]] insertion.

[[Acne]] affects most individuals with PAPA syndrome but to a variable degree. It is usually of a severe nodulocystic type which if untreated results in [[scarring]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==Treatment==
Acne treatment may require oral [[tetracycline]] antibiotics or [[isotretinoin]]. Treatments directed at [[tumour necrosis factor]] ([[Tumor necrosis factors|TNF]]) ([[infliximab]], [[etanercept]]) and [[interleukin-1]] ([[anakinra]]) have shown a good response in resistant [[arthritis]] and [[pyoderma gangrenosum]].<ref>Stichweh DS, Punaro M, Pascual V.
