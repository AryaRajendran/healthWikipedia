'''Desmoplastic small-round-cell tumor''' is classified as a [[soft tissue sarcoma]]. It is an aggressive and rare tumor that primarily occurs as masses in the [[abdomen]].<ref name="pmid17964965">{{cite journal |author=Lee YS, Hsiao CH |title=Desmoplastic small round cell tumor: a clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical and molecular study of four patients |journal=J.

Reported sites of metatastic spread include the [[liver]], [[lung]]s, [[lymph nodes]], [[brain]], skull, and [[bone]]s.

The [[tumor]] is considered a childhood cancer that predominantly strikes boys and young adults. 

The disease rarely occurs in females, but when it does the tumors can be mistaken for [[ovarian cancer]].<ref name="pmid18081791">{{cite journal |author=Bland AE, Shah AA, Piscitelli JT, Bentley RC, Secord AA |title=Desmoplastic small round cell tumor masquerading as advanced ovarian cancer |journal=Int J Gynecol Cancer |volume= 18|issue= 4|pages= 847|year=2007 |pmid=18081791 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-1438.2007.01110.x }}</ref>

In dogs, [[mast cell tumor]]s are the most frequent round cell tumor.<ref>Mackowiak II ''et al'' (2012) E-cadherin in canine mast cell tumors: Decreased expression and altered subcellular localization in Grade 3 tumors. ''Vet J'' '''194(3)''':405-11</ref>

==Causes==

There are no known risk factors that have been identified specific to the disease. The tumor appears to arise from the primitive cells of childhood, and is considered a childhood cancer.

Research has indicated that there is a chimeric relationship between desmoplastic small-round-cell tumor (DSRCT) and [[Wilms' tumor]] and [[Ewing's sarcoma]]. Together with neuroblastoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, they form the small cell tumors.

DSRCT is associated with a unique chromosomal translocation (t11;22)(p13:q12)<ref name="pmid18703217">{{cite journal |author=Murphy AJ, Bishop K, Pereira C, ''et al.'' |title=A new molecular variant of desmoplastic small round cell tumor: significance of WT1 immunostaining in this entity |journal=Hum.

==Symptoms==

There are few early warning signs that a patient has a DSRCT. Patients are often young and healthy as the tumors grow and spread uninhibited within the abdominal cavity. These are rare tumors and symptoms are often misdiagnosed by family physicians. The abdominal masses can grow to enormous size before being noticed by the patient. The tumors can be felt as hard, round masses by palpating the abdomen.

First symptoms of the disease often include abdominal distention, abdominal mass, abdominal or back pain, gastrointestinal obstruction, lack of appetite, [[ascites]], anemia, and/or [[cachexia]].

Other reported symptoms include unknown lumps, thyroid conditions, hormonal conditions, blood clotting, kidney or urological problems, testicle, breast, uterine, vaginal, or ovarian masses

==Differential Diagnoses==

Because this is a rare tumor, not many family physicians or oncologists are familiar with this disease. DSRCT in young patients can be mistaken for other abdominal tumors including [[rhabdomyosarcoma]], [[neuroblastoma]], and mesenteric [[carcinoid]]. In older patients DSRCT can resemble [[lymphoma]], [[peritoneal mesothelioma]], and peritoneal carcinomatosis. In males DSRCT may be mistaken for [[germ cell cancer|germ cell]] or [[testicular cancer]] while in females DSRCT can be mistaken for Ovarian cancer. DSRCT shares characteristics with other small-round blue cell cancers including Ewing's sarcoma, acute leukemia, small cell mesothelioma, neuroblastoma, [[primitive neuroectodermal tumor]], [[rhabdomyosarcoma]], and Wilms' tumor.

==Pathology==

The entity was first described by pathologists [[William L. Gerald]] and [[Juan Rosai]] in 1989.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gerald WL, Rosai J |title=Case 2. Desmoplastic small cell tumor with divergent differentiation |journal=Pediatr Pathol |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=177–83 |year=1989 |pmid=2473463 }}</ref> Pathology reveals well circumscribed solid tumor nodules within a dense desmoplastic stroma.  Often areas of central necrosis are present.  Tumor cells have hyperchromatic nuclei with increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio. 

On immunohistochemistry, these cells have trilinear coexpression including the epithelial marker cytokeratin, the mesenchymal markers desmin and vimentin, and the neuronal marker neuron-specific enolase.  Thus, although initially thought to be of mesothelial origin due to sites of presentation, it is now hypothesized to arise from a progenitor cell with multiphenotypic differentiation.

==Treatment==

DSRCT is frequently misdiagnosed. Adult patients should always be referred to a sarcoma specialist. This is an aggressive, rare, fast spreading tumor and both pediatric and adult patients should be treated at a sarcoma center.

There is no standard protocol for the disease;<ref name="pmid17915050">{{cite journal |author=Talarico F, Iusco D, Negri L, Belinelli D |title=Combined resection and multi-agent adjuvant chemotherapy for intra-abdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumour: case report and review of the literature |journal=G Chir |volume=28 |issue=10 |pages=367–70 |year=2007 |pmid=17915050 |doi= |url=http://www.giornalechirurgia.it/index.php?PAGE=article&ID=2393}}</ref> however, recent journals and studies have reported that some patients respond to high dose (P6 Protocol) [[chemotherapy]], maintenance chemotherapy, [[debulking operation]], cytoreductive surgery, and [[radiation therapy]]. Other treatment options include: [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]], intensity-modulated radiation Therapy, [[radiofrequency ablation]], stereotactic body radiation therapy, [[intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemoperfusion]], and [[clinical trial]]s.

==Prognosis==

The prognosis for DSRCT remains poor.<ref name="pmid18566684">{{cite journal |author=Aguilera D, Hayes-Jordan A, Anderson P, Woo S, Pearson M, Green H |title=Outpatient and home chemotherapy with novel local control strategies in DSRCT |journal=Sarcoma |volume=2008 |issue= |pages=261589 |year=2008 |pmid=18566684 |pmc=2430011 |doi=10.1155/2008/261589}}</ref> The 5-year survival rate of DRSCT is only approximately
15%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lal DR, Su WT, Wolden SL, Loh KC, Modak S, La Quaglia MP |title=Results of multimodal treatment for desmoplastic small round cell tumors |journal=J. Pediatr. Surg. |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=251–5 |year=2005 |month=January |pmid=15868593 |doi=10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2004.09.046 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022346804006499}}</ref> Prognosis depends upon the stage of the cancer. Because the disease can be misdiagnosed or remain undetected, tumors frequently grow large within the abdomen and [[metastasis|metastasize]] or seed to other parts of the body. 

There is no known organ or area of origin. DSRCT can metastasize through lymph nodes or the blood stream. Sites of metastatis include the spleen, diaphragm, liver, large and small intestine, lungs, central nervous system, bones, uterus, bladder, genitals, abdominal cavity, and the brain. 

A multi-modality approach of high dose chemotherapy, aggressive surgical resection,<ref name="pmid17915050">{{cite journal |author=Talarico F, Iusco D, Negri L, Belinelli D |title=Combined resection and multi-agent adjuvant chemotherapy for intra-abdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumour: case report and review of the literature |journal=G Chir |volume=28 |issue=10 |pages=367–70 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17915050 |doi= |url=http://www.giornalechirurgia.it/index.php?PAGE=article&ID=2393}}</ref> radiation, and stem cell rescue improves survival for some patients. Reports have indicated that patients will initially respond to first line chemotherapy and treatment but that relapse is common.

Some patients in remission or with inoperable tumor seem to benefit from long term low dose chemotherapy, turning DSRCT into a chronic disease.

==Research==

The Stehlin Foundation<ref>[http://www.stehlin.org Official website for Stehlin Foundation ]</ref> currently offers DSRCT patients the opportunity to send samples of their tumors free of charge for testing. Research scientists are growing the samples on nude mice and testing various chemical agents to find which are most effective against the individual's tumor.

Patients with advanced DSRCT may qualify to participate in [[clinical trials]] that are researching new drugs to treat the disease.

==Alternative names==

This disease is also known as: [[desmoplastic]] small round blue cell tumor; intraabdominal desmoplastic small round blue cell tumor; desmoplastic small cell tumor; desmoplastic cancer; desmoplastic sarcoma; DSRCT.

There is no connection to [[peritoneal mesothelioma]] which is another disease sometimes described as desmoplastic.
