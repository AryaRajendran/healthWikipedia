A '''solvent''' (from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''[[wikt:solvo#Latin|solvō]]'', "I loosen, untie, I solve") is a substance that dissolves a [[solute]] (a chemically different liquid, solid or gas), resulting in a [[solution]]. A solvent is usually a liquid but can also be a solid or a gas. The maximum quantity of solute that can dissolve in a specific volume of solvent varies with [[temperature]]. Common uses for [[Organic compound|organic]] solvents are in [[dry cleaning]] (e.g., [[tetrachloroethylene]]), as [[paint thinner]]s (e.g., [[toluene]], [[turpentine]]), as nail polish removers and glue solvents ([[acetone]], [[methyl acetate]], [[ethyl acetate]]), in spot removers (e.g., [[hexane]], petrol ether), in detergents ([[D-limonene|citrus terpenes]]), in [[perfume]]s ([[ethanol]]), [[nail polish]] and in chemical synthesis. The use of [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] solvents (other than water) is typically limited to research [[chemistry]] and some technological processes.

The global solvent market is expected to earn revenues of about US$33 billion in 2019. The dynamic economic development in [[emerging markets]] like [[China]], [[India]], [[Brazil]], or [[Russia]] will especially continue to boost demand for solvents. Specialists expect the worldwide solvent consumption to increase at an average annual rate of 2.5% over the next years. Accordingly, the growth rate seen during the past eight years will be surpassed.<ref>[http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/chemicals/solvents Market Study on Solvents]. Ceresana Research</ref>

==Solutions and solvation==
When one substance is [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolved]] into another, a [[solution]] is formed.<ref>Tinoco, Ignacio; Sauer, Kenneth and Wang, James C. (2002) ''Physical Chemistry'' Prentice Hall p. 134 ISBN 0-13-026607-8</ref> This is opposed to the situation when the compounds are [[solubility|insoluble]] like sand in water. In solution, all of the ingredients are uniformly distributed at a molecular level and no residue remains. The mixing is referred to as [[miscibility]], whereas the ability to dissolve one compound into another is known as [[solubility]]. However, in addition to mixing, both substances in the solution interact with each other. When something is dissolved, molecules of the solvent arrange themselves around [[molecules]] of the solute. [[Heat]] is involved and [[entropy]] is increased making the solution more [[thermodynamics|thermodynamically]] stable than the solute alone. This arrangement is mediated by the respective chemical properties of the solvent and solute, such as [[hydrogen bonding]], [[Bond dipole moment|dipole moment]] and [[polarizability]].<ref>Lowery and Richardson, pp. 181–183</ref>

==Solvent classifications==
Solvents can be broadly classified into two categories: ''polar'' and ''non-polar''. Generally, the [[dielectric constant]] of the solvent provides a rough measure of a solvent's polarity. The strong polarity of water is indicated, at 0 °C, by a dielectric constant of 88;{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. Solvents with a dielectric constant of less than 15 are generally considered to be nonpolar.<ref name=p177>Lowery and Richardson, p. 177.</ref> Technically, the dielectric constant measures the solvent's ability to reduce the field strength of the electric field surrounding a [[ion|charged particle]] immersed in it. This reduction is then compared to the [[field strength]] of the charged particle in a vacuum.<ref name=p177/> In layperson's terms, dielectric constant of a solvent can be thought of as its ability to reduce the solute's [[chemical polarity|internal charge]].

===Other polarity scales===
Dielectric constants are not the only measure of polarity. Because solvents are used by chemists to carry out chemical reactions or observe chemical and biological phenomena, more specific measures of polarity are required.

''The Grunwald [[Saul Winstein|Winstein]] m'''Y''' scale'' measures polarity in terms of solvent influence on buildup of positive charge of a solute during a chemical reaction.

''Kosower's '''Z''' scale'' measures polarity in terms of the influence of the solvent on [[Ultraviolet|UV]]-absorption maxima of a salt, usually [[pyridinium]] [[iodide]] or the pyridinium [[zwitterion]].<ref>Kosower, E.M. (1969) "An introduction to Physical Organic Chemistry" Wiley: New York, p. 293</ref>

''Donor number and donor acceptor scale'' measures polarity in terms of how a solvent interacts with specific substances, like a strong [[Lewis acid]] or a strong Lewis base.<ref>{{Cite journal|author = Gutmann, V.|journal = [[Coord. Chem. Rev.]]|year = 1976|volume = 18|issue = 2|page = 225|doi = 10.1016/S0010-8545(00)82045-7|title = Solvent effects on the reactivities of organometallic compounds}}</ref>

The polarity, dipole moment, polarizability and [[hydrogen bonding]] of a solvent determines what type of [[Chemical compound|compounds]] it is able to dissolve and with what other solvents or liquid compounds it is [[miscible]]. Generally, polar solvents dissolve polar compounds best and non-polar solvents dissolve non-polar compounds best: "like dissolves like". Strongly polar compounds like [[sugars]] (e.g., sucrose) or ionic compounds, like [[Inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] [[salt]]s (e.g., [[table salt]]) dissolve only in very polar solvents like water, while strongly non-polar compounds like [[oil]]s or [[wax]]es dissolve only in very non-polar organic solvents like [[hexane]]. Similarly, water and [[hexane]] (or [[vinegar]] and vegetable oil) are not [[miscible]] with each other and will quickly separate into two layers even after being shaken well.

===Polar protic and polar aprotic===
Solvents with a [[relative static permittivity]] greater than 15 can be further divided into [[protic]] and aprotic. Protic solvents solvate [[anion]]s (negatively charged solutes) strongly via [[hydrogen bonding]]. Water is a protic solvent. Aprotic solvents such as [[acetone]] or [[dichloromethane]] tend to have large [[Molecular dipole moment|dipole moments]] (separation of partial positive and partial negative charges within the same molecule) and solvate positively charged species via their negative dipole.<ref>Lowery and Richardson, p. 183.</ref> In [[chemical reaction]]s the use of polar protic solvents favors the [[SN1 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>1]] [[reaction mechanism]], while polar aprotic solvents favor the [[SN2 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>2]] reaction mechanism.

==Physical properties of common solvents==

===Properties table of common solvents===
The solvents are grouped into non-polar, polar aprotic, and polar protic solvents and ordered by increasing polarity. The polarity is given as the [[dielectric constant]]. The [[properties]] of solvents that exceed those of water are bolded.

===Hansen solubility parameter values (HSPiP)===
There's another powerful way to look at these same solvents. By knowing their [[Hansen solubility parameter]] values,<ref name=hansen/><ref name=hansen2/> which are based on δD=[[Van der Waals forces|dispersion bonds]], δP=[[polar bonds]] and δH=[[hydrogen bonds]], you know important things about their inter-molecular interactions with other solvents and also with polymers, pigments, nanoparticles etc. so you can do two things. First, you can create rational formulations knowing, for example, that there is a good HSP match between a solvent and a polymer. Second, you can make rational substitutions for "good" solvents (they dissolve things well) that are "bad" (for the environment, for health, for cost etc.). The following table shows that the intuitions from "non-polar", "polar aprotic" and "polar protic" are put numerically – the "polar" molecules have higher levels of δP and the protic solvents have higher levels of δH. Because numerical values are used, comparisons can be made rationally by comparing numbers. So acetonitrile is much more polar than acetone but slightly less hydrogen bonding.

Consider a simple example of rational substitution. Suppose for environmental reasons we needed to replace the chlorinated solvent, chloroform, with a solvent (blend) of equal solvency using a mixture of two non-chlorinated solvents from this table. Via trial-and-error, a spreadsheet or some software such as HSPiP<ref name=hansen>Abbott, Steven and Hansen, Charles M. (2008) [http://books.google.com/books?id=efMbTvlfc8wC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=false Hansen Hansen Solubility Parameters in Practice], ISBN 0-9551220-2-3</ref><ref name=hansen2>Hansen, Charles M. (2007) [http://books.google.com/books?id=gprF31cvT2oC&printsec=frontcover Hansen solubility parameters: a user's handbook] CRC Press, ISBN 0-8493-7248-8</ref> we find that a 50:50 mix of toluene and 1,4 dioxane is a close match. The δD of the mixture is the average of 18.0 and 17.5 = 17.8. The δP of the mixture is the average of 1.4 and 1.8 = 1.6 and the δH of the mixture is the average of 2.0 and 9.0 = 5.5. So the mixture is 17.8, 1.6, 5.5 compared to Chloroform at 17.8, 3.1, 5.7. Because Toluene itself has many health issues, other mixtures of solvents can be found using a full [[Hansen solubility parameter]] dataset.

An important property of solvents is the boiling point. This also determines the speed of evaporation. Small amounts of low-boiling-point solvents like [[diethyl ether]], [[dichloromethane]], or acetone will evaporate in seconds at room temperature, while high-boiling-point solvents like water or [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] need higher temperatures, an air flow, or the application of [[vacuum]] for fast evaporation.
*Low boilers: boiling point below 100 °C (boiling point of water)
*Medium boilers: between 100 °C and 150 °C
*High boilers: above 150 °C

===Density===
Most organic solvents have a lower [[density]] than water, which means they are lighter and will form a separate layer on top of water. An important exception: most of the [[halogen]]ated solvents like [[dichloromethane]] or [[chloroform]] will sink to the bottom of a container, leaving water as the top layer. This is important to remember when [[partition coefficient|partitioning]] compounds between solvents and water in a [[separatory funnel]] during chemical syntheses.

Often, specific gravity is cited in place of density. Specific gravity is defined as the density of the solvent divided by the density of water at the same temperature. As such, specific gravity is a unitless value. It readily communicates whether a water-insoluble solvent will float (SG < 1.0) or sink (SG > 1.0) when mixed with water.

==Health and safety==

===Fire===

Most organic solvents are flammable or highly flammable, depending on their volatility. Exceptions are some chlorinated solvents like [[dichloromethane]] and [[chloroform]]. Mixtures of solvent vapors and air can [[explosion|explode]]. Solvent vapors are heavier than air; they will sink to the bottom and can travel large distances nearly undiluted. Solvent vapors can also be found in supposedly empty drums and cans, posing a [[flash fire]] hazard; hence empty containers of volatile solvents should be stored open and upside down.

Both [[diethyl ether]] and [[carbon disulfide]] have exceptionally low [[autoignition temperature]]s which increase greatly the fire risk associated with these solvents. The autoignition temperature of carbon disulfide is below 100°C (212°F), so objects such as [[steam]] pipes, [[light bulb]]s, [[hotplate]]s and recently extinguished [[bunsen burner]]s are able to ignite its vapours.

===Explosive peroxide formation===
[[Ether]]s like [[diethyl ether]] and [[tetrahydrofuran]] (THF) can form highly explosive [[organic peroxide]]s upon exposure to oxygen and light, THF is normally more able to form such [[peroxide]]s than diethyl ether. One of the most susceptible solvents is [[diisopropyl ether]].

The heteroatom ([[oxygen]]) stabilizes the formation of a [[free radical]] which is formed by the abstraction of a [[hydrogen]] atom by another free radical. The carbon centred free radical thus formed is able to react with an oxygen molecule to form a peroxide compound. A range of tests can be used to detect the presence of a peroxide in an ether; one is to use a combination of [[iron sulfate]] and [[potassium thiocyanate]]. The peroxide is able to [[oxidize]] the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion to an Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion which then form a deep red [[coordination complex]] with the [[thiocyanate]]. In extreme cases the peroxides can form [[crystalline]] solids within the vessel of the ether.

Unless the [[desiccant]] used can destroy the peroxides, they will concentrate during distillation due to their higher [[boiling point]]. When sufficient peroxides have formed, they can form a crystalline and shock sensitive solid [[precipitate]]. When this solid is formed at the mouth of the bottle, turning the cap may provide sufficient energy for the peroxide to detonate. Peroxide formation is not a significant problem when solvents are used up quickly; they are more of a problem for laboratories which take years to finish a single bottle. Ethers have to be stored in the dark in closed canisters in the presence of stabilizers like [[butylated hydroxytoluene]] (BHT) or over [[sodium hydroxide]].

Peroxides may be removed by washing with acidic iron(II) sulfate, filtering through [[alumina]], or [[distillation|distilling]] from [[sodium]]/[[benzophenone]]. Alumina does not destroy the peroxides; it merely traps them. The advantage of using sodium/benzophenone is that [[moisture]] and [[oxygen]] are removed as well.

===Health effects===
General health hazards associated with solvent exposure include toxicity to the nervous system, reproductive damage, liver and kidney damage, respiratory impairment, cancer, and [[dermatitis]].<ref>[http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/solvents/index.html U.S. Department of Labor > Occupational Safety & Health Administration > Solvents]. osha.gov</ref>

Many solvents can lead to a sudden loss of consciousness if [[inhalation|inhaled]] in large amounts. Solvents like [[diethyl ether]] and [[chloroform]] have been used in medicine as [[anesthetics]], [[sedatives]], and [[hypnotics]] for a long time. [[Ethanol]] (grain alcohol) is a widely used and abused [[psychoactive drug]]. Diethyl ether, chloroform, and many other solvents (e.g., from [[gasoline]] or glues) are used recreationally in [[Volatile substance abuse|glue sniffing]], often with harmful long term health effects like [[neurotoxicity]] or [[cancer]]. [[Methanol]] can cause permanent blindness and death. It is also dangerous because it burns with an invisible flame.

It is interesting to note that ethanol has a synergistic effect when taken in combination with many solvents. For instance a combination of [[toluene]]/[[benzene]] and ethanol causes greater [[nausea]]/[[vomiting]] than either substance alone.

Some solvents including chloroform and [[benzene]] (an ingredient of [[gasoline]]) are [[carcinogen]]ic. Many others can damage internal organs like the [[liver]], the [[kidney]]s, or the [[Human brain|brain]].

Chronic exposure to organic solvents in the work environment can produce a range of adverse neuropsychiatric effects. For example, occupational exposure to [[organic solvents]] has been associated with higher numbers of painters suffering from [[alcoholism]].<ref name="pmid1606027">{{cite journal |author=Lundberg I, Gustavsson A, Högberg M, Nise G |title= Diagnoses of alcohol abuse and other neuropsychiatric disorders among house painters compared with house carpenters |journal=Br J Ind Med |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=409–15 |year=1992 |pmid=1606027 |pmc=1012122 }}</ref>

====General precautions====
{{howto|date=March 2013}}
*Avoid being exposed to solvent vapors by working in a [[fume hood]], or with local exhaust ventilation (LEV), or in a well ventilated area
*Keep the storage containers tightly closed
*Never use open flames near flammable solvents; use [[central heating]] or electrical heating instead
*Never flush flammable solvents down the drain; read safety data sheets for proper disposal information
*Avoid the inhalation of solvent vapors
*Avoid contact of the solvent with the skin — many solvents are easily absorbed through the skin. They also tend to dry the skin and may cause sores and wounds.

===Environmental contamination===
A major pathway to induce health effects arises from spills or leaks of solvents that reach the underlying soil. Since solvents readily migrate substantial distances, the creation of widespread [[soil contamination]] is not uncommon; there may be about 5000 sites worldwide that have major subsurface solvent contamination; this is particularly a health risk if [[aquifer]]s are affected.
