'''Toes''' are the [[Digit (anatomy)|digit]]s of the [[foot]] of a [[tetrapod]]. [[Animal]] species such as [[cat]]s that walk on their toes are described as being ''[[digitigrade]]''. [[Human]]s, and other animals that walk on the soles of their feet, are described as being ''[[plantigrade]]''; ''[[unguligrade]]'' animals are those that walk on [[hoof|hooves]] at the tips of their toes. 
The toes are, from [[Anatomical terms of location#Left and right (lateral), and medial|medial to lateral]]:
*[[Hallux]] ("big toe" or "great toe"), the innermost (most [[proximal]]) toe and the closest to the toes of the other foot
*[[Long toe|Second toe]] or "long toe"
*[[Third toe]], or "middle toe"
*[[Fourth toe]], or "ring toe"
*[[Fifth toe]] ("little toe", "pinky toe", or "baby toe"), the outermost (most distal) toe

==Toe anatomy and physiology==

The human foot consists of multiple bones and soft tissues which support the weight of the [[bipedalism|upright human]].  Specifically, the toes assist the human while [[walking]],<ref name='toe_walking'>Janey Hughes, Peter Clark, & Leslie Klenerman.  ''The Importance of the Toes in Walking.''  The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Vol. 72-B, No. 2.  March, 1990.  [http://www.jbjs.org.uk/cgi/reprint/72-B/2/245.pdf]</ref> providing balance, weight-bearing, and thrust during the [[gait]]. Toe bones articulate around the [[metatarsal]] bones which make up the central portion of the human foot.  The joints between bones of the toe are known as [[Interphalangeal articulations of the foot|interphalangeal joints]].  Movements are generally instigated by way of tendons actuated by muscles in the lower leg.

The hallux (large toe) is primarily flexed by the ''[[flexor hallucis longus muscle]]'', located in the deep [[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] of the lower leg, via the ''[[flexor hallucis longus]]'' [[tendon]].  Additional flexion control is provided by the  ''[[flexor hallucis brevis]]''.  It is extended by the ''[[abductor hallucis muscle]]'' and the ''[[adductor hallucis muscle]]''.   The remaining toes are primarily controlled by the ''[[flexor digitorum brevis muscle]]'' and the ''[[extensor digitorum brevis muscle]]''.  Finally, the fifth toe (the smallest toe) has a separate set of control muscles and tendon attachments, the ''[[flexor digiti minimi brevis muscle (foot)|flexor]]'' and ''[[abductor digiti minimi muscle (foot)|abductor]] digiti minimi''.  Numerous other [[:Category:Foot muscles|foot muscles]] contribute to fine motor control of the foot.  The connective tendons between the minor toes accounts for the inability to actuate individual toes.

Humans usually have five toes on each foot. Exceptions include [[polydactyly]] (more than five toes), and [[syndactyly]] or [[amputation]] (fewer than five toes).  The four smallest toes consist of three phalanx bones, while the largest consists of two phalanx bones and two [[sesamoid bones]].  Many of the [[flexor]] tendons are shared, making it impossible to move individual toes independently; however, some  [[prehensility]], or grasping capability, does exist for most humans.

Forefoot shape, including toe shape, exhibits significant variation among people; these differences can be measured and have been statistically correlated with [[ethnicity]].<ref name='foot_shape'>''Ethnic differences in forefoot shape and the determination of shoe comfort.''  Hawes, Sovak, Miyashita, Kang, Yosihuku, and Tanaka.  ''Ergonomics'', Vol. 37, No. 1, Page 187.  1994.  Available at [http://www.informaworld.com/index/779153123.pdf]</ref>  Such deviations may affect comfort and fit for various shoe types.  Research conducted by Freedman for the U.S. Army<ref name='freedman_army'>Freedman, A., Huntington, E.C., Davis, G.C., Magee, R.B., Milstead, V.M. and
Kirkpatrick, C.M..  1946.  ''Foot Dimensions of Soldiers (Third Partial Report)'', [[Armored Medical Research Laboratory]], [[Fort Knox]], Kentucky.</ref> indicated that larger feet may still have smaller arches, toe length, and toe-breadth.  Specifically measurable toe and forefoot metrics for humans include<ref name='foot_shape'/>:
*height
*breadth and girth
*[[Ball (anatomy)|ball length]]
*digital pattern
*heel to toe length
*[[footprint]] layout
Each of these metrics has been correlated to particular ethnic groups, but absolute deviations in dimensions are relatively small; such deviations may or may not be practically significant from the ergonomic or comfort standpoint...

== Injuries ==
{{anchor|stubbed toe}}A sprain or strain to the small [[Interphalangeal articulations of foot|interphalangeal joints]] of the toe is commonly called a '''stubbed toe'''.<ref>[http://www.aurorahealthcare.org/yourhealth/healthgate/getcontent.asp?URLhealthgate=%2211499.html%22 Your Health - Toe Sprain<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A sprain or strain where the toe joins to the foot is called '''[[turf toe]]'''. 

A [[bunion]] is a structural deformity of the bones and the [[joint]] between the foot and big toe, and may be painful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footphysicians.com/footankleinfo/bunions.htm |author=American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons |title=Bunions |accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref> Similar deformity involving the [[fifth toe]] is described as [[tailor's bunion]] or bunionette.

Long-term use of improperly sized shoes can cause misalignment of toes, as well as other orthopedic problems.

==Toe pain==
A patient often refers to all forms of toe abnormalities as a hammer toe. There are three main forms of toe abnormalities: claw toes, hammer toes and trigger toe. A hammer toe can be best described as an abnormal contraction or “buckling” of a toe. This is done by a partial or complete dislocation of one of the joints, which form the toes. Since the toes are deformed further, they will then press against the shoe and can cause corns. 

===Symptoms of toe pain===
# A hammer toe may be painful, especially when irritated by a shoe.
# All four toes conditions can cause cramps in the toes, feet and legs due to the abnormal function of the tendons in the foot.
# If a mallet toe has occurred, you probably suffer from a corn at the end of the toe.
# A hammer toe may cause a corn on top of the toe (see picture below).* Infections and ulcers may also occur.
# Infections and ulcers may also occur.
# In severe cases, cause a mallet toe, toe, claw toes or hammer toes may press on the foot that can lead to hard skin and corns on the soles of the feet.

===Causes of toe pain===
Pain, occurs because of certain reasons. listed the causes of pain in the toe.

# Inappropriate shoes.
# Flat feet can result in hammertoes, this is due to poor mechanics of the foot.
# High arched feet can also result in wrinkled toes.
# A major cause is hereditary, all the toes because the conditions could be acquired, hereditary factors.
# Bunions are one of the main causes of hammer toes.
# Claw toes are usually the result of a shoe that is too short. For many people the second toe is actually longer than the big toe, and if shoes sized to fit the big toe is the second (and perhaps even the third toe) must bend to fit into the shoe. Shoes that are pointed make matters even worse. Combine pointed shoes with high heels, the foot under similar pressure as if it was constantly pushed downhill into a wall.
# Rheumatoid arthritis can also result in bales, which can lead to hammer toe
