'''Septic arthritis''' is the [[purulent]] invasion of a [[joint]] by an [[infection|infectious]] agent which produces [[arthritis]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000008993|septic arthritis}}</ref> People with [[Joint replacement|artificial joints]] are more at risk than the general population but have slightly different symptoms, are infected with different organisms and require different treatment.<ref name='UpToDate'>{{cite web | url = http://www.uptodate.com/patients/content/topic.do?topicKey=~ppDv.6R7/5jRTk | title = Patient information: Joint infection | accessdate = 2010-06-07 | last = Don L | first = Goldenberg | coauthors = Daniel J Sexton (ed) | date = 2009-06-30 | work = UpToDate for Patients (UpToDate, Inc) | publisher = Wolters Kluwer Health | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080611113549/http://www.uptodate.com/patients/content/topic.do?topicKey=~ppDv.6R7/5jRTk | archivedate = 2008-06-11}}</ref>  Septic arthritis is considered a medical emergency.  If untreated, it may destroy the joint in a period of days.  The infection may also spread to other parts of the body.

==Terminology==
The term "suppurative arthritis" is a near synonym for septic arthritis. ("[[Suppurative]]" refers to the production of [[pus]], without necessarily implying [[sepsis]].)

[[ICD-10]] uses the term "pyogenic arthritis". [[Pyogenic]] also refers to the production of pus.

[[Reactive arthritis]] refers to arthritis caused by an immune consequence of an infection, but not directly attributable to the infection itself.

The usual [[etiology]] of septic arthritis is [[bacteria]]l, but [[virus|viral]], [[mycobacteria]]l, and [[fungus|fungal]]<ref name="pmid1616344">{{cite journal |author=Cuéllar ML, Silveira LH, Espinoza LR |title=Fungal arthritis |journal=Ann.

Septic/suppurative arthritis and "bacterial arthritis" are sometimes considered equivalent, but there are exceptions. For example, ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]'' can cause infectious arthritis, but is not associated with suppurative arthritis.<ref name="isbn0-7216-0187-1"/>

==Etiology==
Bacteria are carried by the bloodstream from an infectious focus elsewhere, introduced by a [[skin]] [[lesion]] that penetrates the joint, or by extension from adjacent tissue (e.g. bone or bursae bovine tb).

Micro-organisms must reach the [[synovial membrane]] of a joint.  This can happen in any of the following ways:
* dissemination of [[pathogen]]s via the blood, from [[abscess]]es or wound infections, or from an unknown focus
* dissemination from an [[osteomyelitis|acute osteomyelitic focus]],
* dissemination from adjacent [[soft tissue]] infection,
* entry via [[penetrating trauma]]
* entry via [[iatrogenic]] means.<ref name=Axford/>

Bacteria that are commonly found to cause septic arthritis are:
* [[Staphylococcus aureus]] - the most common cause in adults
* [[Streptococcus|Streptococci]] - the second most common cause <ref name=Kaandorp>{{cite journal |author=Kaandorp CJ, Dinant HJ, van de Laar MA, Moens HJ, Prins AP, Dijkmans BA |title=Incidence and sources of native and prosthetic joint infection: a community based prospective survey |journal=Ann.

In bacterial infection, [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]] has been found to infect joints, especially in children who have sustained a puncture wound.  This bacterium also causes [[endocarditis]].<ref>[http://wordnet.com.au/Products/topics_in_infectious_diseases_Aug01.htm Topics in Infectious Diseases Newsletter, August 2001, Pseudomonas aeruginosa.]</ref>

== Diagnosis ==

Septic arthritis should be considered whenever one is assessing a patient with rapid onset of joint pain.  Usually only one joint is affected ([[monoarthritis]]) however in ''seeding'' arthritis, several joints can be affected simultaneously; this is especially the case when the infection is caused by [[staphylococcus]] or [[gonococcus]] bacteria.  Pain can be significant with any movement, therefore, patient will refuse to use extremity and prefers to hold joint rigidly.  May have associated swelling, redness & warmth, often absent for deep joints such as hips & shoulders. In the case of gonorrhea the knee or wrist may be chronically affected. The pain may be chronic and the physician may inject steroids to reduce symptoms. Weeks later increased pain, redness and swelling- signs of inflammation- appear leading to drainage by needle puncture. Then the gram stain and cultures are typical of a Neisserian infection.

The diagnosis of septic arthritic can be difficult as no test is able to completely rule out the possibility.

A number of factors should increase one's suspicion of the presence of an infection.  In children these are: [[fever]] > 38.5 C, non-weight-bearing, serum WBCs > 12 x 10^9, [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR]] > 40&nbsp;mm/hr, [[CRP]] > 20&nbsp;mg/dL, a previous visit for the same.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1072 |title=BestBets: Distinguishing between septic arthritis of the hip and transient synovitis in children |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Diagnosis is by aspiration (giving a turbid, non-viscous fluid), [[Gram stain]] and [[microbiological culture|culture]] of fluid from the joint, as well as tell-tale signs in laboratory testing (such as a highly elevated [[neutrophils]] (approx. 90%), [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR]] or [[CRP]]). The ESR and CRP are almost always raised on admission, CRP being faster in diagnostics.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11999-009-0936-1 |author=Pääkkönen M, Kallio MJ, Kallio PE, Peltola H.  |title=Sensitivity of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein in childhood bone and joint infections. |journal=Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. |volume=468 |issue=3 |pages=861–6. |year=2010 |month=May |pmid=19533263|pmc=2816763}}</ref> In the joint aspirate, the typical white blood cell count in septic arthritis is over 100,000/[[cubic millimetre|mm<sup>3</sup>]].<ref name=medscape>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1268807-overview Septic Arthritis Aspiration Techniques and Indications for Surgery] at Medscape. Author: Nadera Sweiss. Updated: Feb 7, 2012</ref> However, septic synovial fluid can have white blood cell counts as low as a few thousand in the early stages, and therefore, differentiation of septic joints from "merely" inflammatory ones is not truly possible based on cell counts alone.<ref name=medscape/>

The Gram stain can rule in the diagnosis of septic arthritis however cannot exclude it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1636 |title=BestBets: Is a negative gram stain in suspected septic arthritis sufficient to rule out septic arthritis |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

X-rays - may not be helpful early, but may show subtle increase in joint space tissue swelling.

Ultrasound - may reveal joint effusion.

==Treatment==

Therapy is usually with [[intravenous]] [[antibiotic]]s, [[analgesia]] and washout/aspiration of the joint to dryness. Among pediatric patients with an acute hematogenous septic arthritis a short total course of 10 days of antimicrobials is sufficient in uncomplicated cases.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/597582 |author=Peltola H, Pääkkönen M, Kallio MJ, Kallio PE.  |title=Prospective, randomized trial of 10 days versus 30 days of antimicrobial treatment, including a short-term course of parenteral therapy, for childhood septic arthritis. |journal=Clin. Infect. Dis. |volume=48 |issue=9 |pages=1201–10. |year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19323633}}</ref>

In infection of a prosthetic joint, a biofilm is often created on the surface of the prosthesis which is resistant to antibiotics.  Surgical debridement or arthrotomy is usually indicated in these cases.
A replacement prosthesis is usually not inserted at the time of removal to allow antibiotics to clear infection of the region. 

Patients in whom surgery is contraindicated may trial long-term antibiotic therapy.<ref>Prosthetic Joint Infectious Arthritis: Infections of Joints and Bones: Merck Manual Professional [Internet].  [cited 2010 Feb 16];Available from: http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec04/ch039/ch039c.html?qt=Prosthetic%20Joint%20Infectious%20Arthritis&alt=sh</ref>

Close follow up with physical exam & labs must be done to make sure patient remain afebrile, pain resolved, improved range of motion and normalized lab values.

==Radiologic findings==
The diagnosis of septic arthritis is based on clinical assessment and prompt [[arthrocentesis]]. Imaging can sometimes be used to aid in the diagnosis of septic arthritis. 

Native X-ray of the joint is neither sensitive nor specific. Ultrasound can detect joint-swelling. MRI findings include: synovial enhancement, perisynovial edema and joint effusion.  Signal abnormalities in the bone marrow can indicate a concomitant osteomyelitis.  The sensitivity and specificity of MRI for the detection of septic arthritis has been reported to be 67% and 98% respectively.
