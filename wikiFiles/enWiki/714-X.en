'''714-X''' or '''714X''', also referred to as "trimethylbicyclonitramineoheptane chloride", is a mixture of substances manufactured by [[CERBE Distribution Inc]] and sold as an [[alternative medicine|alternative medical treatment]] which is claimed to cure [[cancer]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[fibromyalgia]], and other diseases.<ref>{{cite web | last = Barrett | first = Stephen  | authorlink = Stephen Barrett | title = Fanciful Claims for 714X | publisher = [[Quackwatch]] | date = 2002-03-22 | url = http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/714x.html | accessdate = 2007-01-09}}</ref>

== History ==
714-X was developed by Gaston Naessens, a native of [[France]] and tried there for [[practicing medicine without a license]]. Naessens moved to [[Quebec]] and continued his research since the early 1970s. In 1989 He was arrested but acquitted from charges of accessory to murder, after a cancer patient using 714-X died following refusal to take conventional medical treatment.  

The name "714-X" was chosen by Naessens to symbolize his initials (the 7th and 14th letters of the alphabet) and the year of his birth (1924, as X is the 24th letter).<ref name="kaegi"/> The marketers claim that 714-X works by counteracting the harm done by "[[somatid]]s", a life form which is not [[bacteria]]l, [[Virus|viral]] or [[Fungus|fungal]], but which instead belongs to a distinct [[Domain (biology)|domain]] unknown to modern science and medicine.<ref name="nci">{{cite web | title = 714-X (PDQ) | publisher = [[National Cancer Institute]] | date = 2006-11-01 | url = http://cancernet.nci.nih.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/714-X/healthprofessional | accessdate = 2007-01-09}}</ref>

Sales of 714-X have been banned in the USA by the [[Food and Drug Administration]], and in 1996 Charles Pixley was tried and jailed for advocating and distributing it. During proceedings Pixley claimed it was the re-branding of a homeopathic beverage, known prior to the establishment of the FDA, however Naessens later said that it was completely different and has nothing to do with homeopathy.

==Composition==
714-X is advertised as containing [[camphor]] combined with excess [[nitrogen]], [[ammonium salt]]s, [[sodium chloride]], and [[ethanol]].<ref name="kaegi"/> An analysis by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) found that 714-X was 94% water, with small amounts of the other salts and less than 0.01% camphor.<ref name="fda"/>

==Administration==
714-X is typically [[Injection (medicine)|injected]] into the lymphatic system through the [[groin]]. Alternately, it may be inhaled via a [[nebulizer]].<ref name="nci"/>

==Safety and effectiveness==
No studies have been published on the safety or efficacy of 714-X in humans, and the few available animal studies have shown no beneficial effect.<ref name="kaegi">{{cite journal |author=Kaegi E |title=Unconventional therapies for cancer: 6. 714-X |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=158 |issue=12 |pages=1621–4 |year=1998 |month=June |pmid=9645177 |pmc=1229414 |doi= |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=reprint&pmid=9645177}}</ref>  The [[American Cancer Society]] has stated: "There is no scientific evidence that 714-X is effective in treating any type of cancer or any other illness."<ref name="acs">{{cite web| publisher = [[American Cancer Society]] | url = http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3X_714-X.asp | title = 714-X | date= 2007-07-20 | accessdate= 2008-10-21| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081029033303/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3X_714-X.asp| archivedate= 29 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Legal issues==
The FDA has banned both importation and sale of 714-X as a form of [[health fraud]], and at least one prison sentence has been handed down for importing it into America.<ref name="fda">{{cite journal | last=Kurtzweil | first=Paula  | title=Promoter of 714X Cure-All Faces Prison For Selling Unapproved Drug | journal=[[FDA Consumer]]  | volume= 30 | issue =9 |year=1996  | url=http://www.fda.gov/fdac/departs/996_irs.html | accessdate=2007-01-09 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080128184131/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/departs/996_irs.html | archivedate=2008-01-28 }}</ref> 

714-X is manufactured in [[Canada]], where it is legal to purchase for personal use through a physician under the [[Special Access Programme]] of [[Health Canada]], a law which provides access to non-marketed treatments for terminal illnesses when no marketed alternative exists. However, in October 2004, Health Canada told the manufacturer to remove all references to the compound from its website.<ref name="acs"/> On July 28, 2006, Justice François Lemieux of the Federal Court of Canada granted a request for judicial review undertaken by a group of 714X patients. The judgment voided Health Canada's policy statement and restored access to 714-X under the Special Access Programme under certain conditions.
