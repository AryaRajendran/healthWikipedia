'''Carpus''' is anatomical assembly connecting the [[hand]] to [[forearm]]. In [[human anatomy]], the main role of the carpus is to facilitate effective positioning of the hand and powerful use of the extensors and flexors of the forearm, but the mobility of individual carpal bones increase the freedom of movements at the wrist.<ref name="Kingston-126">Kingston 2000, pp 126-127</ref>

In [[tetrapod]]s, the '''carpus''' is the sole cluster of [[bone]]s in the [[wrist]] between the [[radius (bone)|radius]] and [[ulna]] and the [[metacarpus]]. The bones of the carpus do not belong to individual fingers (or toes in quadrupeds), whereas those of the metacarpus do. The corresponding part of the [[foot]] is the [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]]. The carpal bones allow the wrist to move and rotate vertically.<ref name="Kingston-126">Kingston 2000, pp 126-127</ref>

== Etymology ==
The Latin word "carpus" is derived from Greek καρπὁς meaning "wrist". The root "carp-" translates to "[[wikt:pluck|pluck]]", an action performed by the wrist.
<ref name="Diab-48">Diab 1999, p 48</ref>

== As a whole ==
In [[human anatomy]], the carpal bones can be classified as belonging to two transverse rows or three longitudinal columns.
[[File:Hand of embryo.jpg|thumb|250px|Micro-radiography of 8 weeks human embryo hand]]
The pair of rows together form an arch which is convex proximally and concave distally. On the palmar side, the carpus is concave, forming the [[carpal tunnel]] which is covered by the [[Flexor retinaculum of the hand|flexor retinaculum]].
<ref name="Platzer-124">Platzer 2004, p 124</ref>
Because the proximal row is simultaneously related to the articular surfaces of the radius and the distal row, it adapts constantly to these mobile surfaces. The bones of this row - scaphoid, lunate, and triquetrum - have their individual movements. The scaphoid contributes to the stability of the midcarpus as it articulates distally with the trapezium and the trapezoid. The distal row is more rigid as its transverse arch moves with the metacarpals.
<ref name="Schmidt-29">Schmidt-Lanz 2003, p 29</ref>

[[Biomechanics|Biomechanically]] and clinically, the carpal bones are better understood as arranged in three longitudinal columns:<ref name="Thieme-Atlas-224">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' 2006, p 224</ref>
# A radial scaphoid column consisting of the scaphoideum, trapezium, and trapezoideum
# A lunate column consisting of the lunate and capitate
# A ulnar triquetral column consisting of the triquetrum and hamatum.
In this context the pisiform is regarded as a [[sesamoid bone]] embedded in the tendon of the [[Flexor carpi ulnaris muscle|flexor carpi ulnaris]].<ref name="Thieme-Atlas-224" />
The ulnar column leaves a gap between the ulna and the triquetrum, and therefore, only the radial or scaphoid and central or capitate columns articulate with the radius. The wrist is more stable in flexion than in extension more because of the strength of various capsules and ligaments than the interlocking parts of the skeleton.
<ref name="Schmidt-29" />

=== Ligaments ===
{{double image|right|Gray334.png|150|Gray335.png|150|Ligaments of the wrist}}
There are four groups of ligaments in the region of the wrist:<ref name="Platzer-130">Platzer 2004, p 130</ref>
# The ligaments of the [[wrist]] proper which unite the [[ulna]] and [[radius (bone)|radius]] with the carpus: the [[Ulnar collateral ligament of wrist joint|ulnar]] and [[Radial collateral ligament of wrist joint|radial collateral ligament]]s; the [[palmar radiocarpal ligament|palmar]] and [[dorsal radiocarpal ligament]]s; and the [[palmar ulnocarpal ligament]].
# The ligaments of the [[intercarpal articulations]] which unite the carpal bones with one another: the [[radiate carpal ligament]]; the [[dorsal intercarpal ligament|dorsal]], [[palmar intercarpal ligaments|palmar]], and [[interosseous intercarpal ligaments]]; and the [[pisohamate ligament]],
# The ligaments of the [[carpometacarpal articulations]] which unite the carpal bones with the metacarpal bones: the [[pisometacarpal ligament]] and the [[palmar carpometacarpal ligaments|palmar]] and [[dorsal carpometacarpal ligaments]]
# The ligaments of the [[intermetacarpal articulations]] which unite the metacarpal bones: the [[dorsal metacarpal ligaments|dorsal]], [[interosseous metacarpal ligaments|interosseous]], and [[palmar metacarpal ligaments]]

=== Movements ===
The hand is said to be in '''straight position''' when the third finger runs over the capitate bone and is in a straight line with the forearm. This should not be confused with the '''midposition''' of the hand which corresponds to an ulnar deviation of 12&nbsp;degrees. From the straight position two pairs of movements of the hand are possible: [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abduction]] (movement towards the radius, so called radial deviation or abduction) of 15&nbsp;degrees and [[adduction]] (movement towards the ulna, so called ulnar deviation or adduction) of 40&nbsp;degrees when the arm is in strict [[supination]] and slightly greater in strict [[pronation]].
<ref name="Platzer-132">Platzer 2004, p 132</ref>
[[Flexion]] (tilting towards the palm, so called palmar flexion) and [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]] (tilting towards the back of the hand, so called dorsiflexion) is possible with a total range of 170&nbsp;degrees.
<ref name="Platzer-134">Platzer 2004, p 134</ref>

==== Radial abduction/ulnar adduction ====
During '''radial abduction''' the scaphoid is tilted towards the palmar side which allows the trapezium and trapezoid to approach the radius. Because the trapezoid is rigidly attached to the second metacarpal bone to which also the flexor carpi radialis and extensor carpi radialis are attached, radial abduction effectively pulls this combined structure towards the radius. During radial abduction the pisiform traverses the greatest path of all carpal bones.
<ref name="Platzer-132" />
Radial abduction is produced by (in order of importance) [[Extensor carpi radialis longus muscle|extensor carpi radialis longus]], [[Abductor pollicis longus muscle|abductor pollicis longus]], [[Extensor pollicis longus muscle|extensor pollicis longus]], [[Flexor carpi radialis muscle|flexor carpi radialis]], and [[Flexor pollicis longus muscle|flexor pollicis longus]].
<ref name="Platzer-172">Platzer 2004, p 172</ref>

'''Ulnar adduction''' causes a tilting or dorsal shifting of the proximal row of carpal bones.<ref name="Platzer-132" />
It is produced by [[Extensor carpi ulnaris muscle|extensor carpi ulnaris]], [[Flexor carpi ulnaris muscle|flexor carpi ulnaris]], [[Extensor digitorum muscle|extensor digitorum]], and [[Extensor digiti minimi muscle|extensor digiti minimi]].<ref name="Platzer-172" />

Both radial abduction and ulnar adduction occurs around a dorsopalmar axis running through the head of the capitate bone.
<ref name="Platzer-132" />

==== Palmar flexion/dorsiflexion ====
During '''palmar flexion''' the proximal carpal bones are displaced towards the ''dorsal'' side and towards the ''palmar'' side during '''dorsiflexion'''. While flexion and extension consist of movements around a pair of transverse axes &mdash; passing through the lunate bone for the proximal row and through the capitate bone for the distal row &mdash; palmar flexion occurs mainly in the [[radiocarpal joint]] and dorsiflexion in the [[midcarpal joint]].
<ref name="Platzer-134" />

Dorsiflexion is produced by (in order of importance) [[Extensor digitorum muscle|extensor digitorum]], [[Extensor carpi radialis longus muscle|extensor carpi radialis longus]], [[Extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle|extensor carpi radialis brevis]], [[Extensor indicis muscle|extensor indicis]], [[Extensor pollicis longus muscle|extensor pollicis longus]], and [[Extensor digiti minimi muscle|extensor digiti minimi]]. Palmar flexion is produced by (in order of importance) [[Flexor digitorum superficialis muscle|flexor digitorum superficialis]], [[Flexor digitorum profundus muscle|flexor digitorum profundus]], [[Flexor carpi ulnaris muscle|flexor carpi ulnaris]], [[Flexor pollicis longus muscle|flexor pollicis longus]], [[Flexor carpi radialis muscle|flexor carpi radialis]], and [[Abductor pollicis longus muscle|abductor pollicis longus]].
<ref name="Platzer-172" />

==== Combined movements ====
Combined with movements in both the elbow and shoulder joints, '''intermediate''' or '''combined movements''' in the wrist approximate those of a [[ball-and-socket joint]] with some necessary restrictions, such as maximum palmar flexion blocking abduction.<ref name="Platzer-134" />

==== Accessory movements ====
[[Anatomical terms of location#Anterior and posterior_2|Anteroposterior]] gliding movements between adjacent carpal bones or along the midcarpal joint can be achieved by stabilizing individual bones while moving another (i.e. gripping the bone between the thumb and index finger).
<ref name="Palastanga-184">Palastanga 2006, p 184</ref>

== Individual bones ==
{{Double image|right|RightHumanPosteriorDistalRadiusUlnaCarpals.jpg|175|RightHumanAnteriorDistalRadiusUlnaCarpals.jpg|150|Posterior and anterior view of a human carpus}}
Almost all carpals (except the pisiform) have six surfaces. Of these the ''palmar'' or ''anterior'' and the ''dorsal'' or ''posterior surfaces'' are rough, for ligamentous attachment; the dorsal surfaces being the broader, except in the lunate.

The ''superior'' or ''proximal,'' and ''inferior'' or ''distal surfaces'' are articular, the superior generally convex, the inferior concave; the ''medial'' and ''lateral surfaces'' are also articular where they are in contact with contiguous bones, otherwise they are rough and tuberculated.

The structure in all is similar: [[cancellous]] tissue enclosed in a layer of [[compact bone]].

=== Accessory bones ===
[[Image:Carpalia accessoria cropped.jpg|thumb|Location of the accessory ossicles of the carpals]]
Occasionally [[accessory bone]]s are found in the carpus, but of more than 20 such described bones, only four (the central, styloid, secondary trapezoid, and secondary pisiform bones) are considered to be proven accessory bones. Sometimes the scaphoid, triquetrum, and pisiform bones are divided into two.

The carpal bones are [[Endochondral ossification|ossified endochondrally]] (from within the cartilage) and the ossific centers appear only after birth.
<ref name="Platzer-126" />
The formation of these centers roughly follows a chronological spiral pattern starting in the capitate and hamate during the first year of life. The ulnar bones are then ossified before the radial bones, while the sesamoid pisiform arises in the tendon of the [[flexor carpi ulnaris muscle|flexor carpi ulnaris]] after more than ten years.

== Evolutionary variations ==

The structure of the carpus varies widely between different groups of [[tetrapod]]s, even among those that retain the full set of five digits. In primitive fossil [[amphibian]]s, such as ''[[Eryops]]'', the carpus consists of three rows of bones; a proximal row of three carpals, a second row of four bones, and a distal row of five bones. The proximal carpals are referred to as the '''radiale''', '''intermediale''', and '''ulnare''', after their proximal articulations, and are [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the scaphoid, lunate, and triquetal bones respectively. The remaining bones are simply numbered, as the first to fourth '''centralia''' (singular: '''centrale'''), and the first to fifth '''distal carpals'''. Primitively, each of the distal bones appears to have articulated with a single metacarpal.

However, the vast majority of later vertebrates, including modern amphibians, have undergone varying degrees of loss and fusion of these primitive bones, resulting in a smaller number of carpals. Almost all mammals and reptiles, for example, have lost the fifth distal carpal, and have only a single centrale - and even this is missing in humans. The pisiform bone is somewhat unusual, in that it first appears in primitive reptiles, and is never found in amphibians.

Because many tetrapods have less than five digits on the forelimb, even greater degrees of fusion are common, and a huge array of different possible combinations are found. The wing of a modern [[bird]], for example, has only two remaining carpals; the radiale (the scaphoid of mammals) and a bone formed from the fusion of four of the distal carpals.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 200–202|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>

In some [[Macropodidae|macropod]]s, the scaphoid and lunar bones are fused into the scapholunar bone.<ref>[http://home.brisnet.org.au/~mccready/Swamp%20Wallaby.htm Swamp Wallaby (''Wallabia bicolor'') carpals<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In [[crustacean]]s, "carpus" is the scientific term for the claws or "pincers" present on some legs. (See [[Decapod anatomy]].)
