'''Thrombophilia''' (sometimes '''hypercoagulability''' or a '''prothrombotic state''') is an abnormality of [[blood coagulation]] that increases the risk of [[thrombosis]] (blood clots in blood vessels).<ref name=Kumar4/><ref name=Heit/> Such abnormalities can be identified in 50% of people who have an episode of thrombosis (such as [[deep vein thrombosis]] in the leg) that was not provoked by other causes.<ref name=Kyrle10/> A significant proportion of the population has a detectable abnormality, but most of these only develop thrombosis in the presence of an additional risk factor.<ref name=Heit/>

There is no specific treatment for most thrombophilias, but recurrent episodes of thrombosis may be an indication for long-term preventative [[anticoagulant|anticoagulation]].<ref name=Heit/> The first major form of thrombophilia, [[antithrombin deficiency]], was identified in 1965, while the most common abnormalities (including [[factor V Leiden]]) were described in the 1990s.<ref name=Dahlback/><ref name=RosendaalReitsma/>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:DVT2010.JPG|thumb|right|A right-sided acute deep vein thrombosis (to the left in the image). The leg is swollen and red due to venous outflow obstruction.]]
The most common conditions associated with thrombophilia are [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT) and [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE), which are referred to collectively as [[venous thromboembolism]] (VTE). DVT usually occurs in the legs, and is characterized by pain, swelling and redness of the limb. It may lead to [[Post-thrombotic syndrome|long-term swelling and heaviness]] due to damage to valves in the veins.<ref name=Scarvellis>{{cite journal |author=Scarvelis D, Wells PS |title=Diagnosis and treatment of deep-vein thrombosis |journal=CMAJ |volume=175 |issue=9 |pages=1087–92 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17060659 |pmc=1609160 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.060366 |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/175/9/1087}}</ref> The clot may also break off and migrate ([[embolism|embolize]]) to arteries in the lungs. Depending on the size and the location of the clot, this may lead to sudden-onset [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], [[chest pain]], [[palpitations]] and may be complicated by [[syncope (medicine)|collapse]], [[shock (medicine)|shock]] and [[cardiac arrest]].<ref name=Heit>{{cite journal |author=Heit JA |title=Thrombophilia: common questions on laboratory assessment and management |journal=Hematology Am.

Venous thrombosis may also occur in more unusual places: in the [[cerebral venous sinus thrombosis|veins of the brain]], liver ([[portal vein thrombosis]] and [[Budd-Chiari syndrome|hepatic vein thrombosis]]), [[mesenteric vein (disambiguation)|mesenteric vein]], kidney ([[renal vein thrombosis]]) and [[Paget-Schroetter disease|the veins of the arms]].<ref name=Heit/> Whether thrombophilia also increases the risk of [[arterial thrombosis]] (which is the underlying cause of [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] and [[stroke]]s) is less well established.<ref name=Heit/><ref name=Middeldorp>{{cite journal |author=Middeldorp S, van Hylckama Vlieg A |title=Does thrombophilia testing help in the clinical management of patients? |journal=Br.

[[Protein C deficiency]] may cause [[purpura fulminans]], a severe clotting disorder in the newborn that leads to both tissue death and bleeding into the skin and other organs.

==Causes==
Thrombophilia can be congenital or acquired. ''Congenital thrombophilia'' refers to inborn conditions (and usually hereditary, in which case "''hereditary thrombophilia''" may be used) that increase the tendency to develop thrombosis, while, on the other hand, ''acquired thrombophilia'' refers to conditions that arise later in life.

===Congenital===
The most common types of congenital thrombophilia are those that arise as a result of overactivity of coagulation factors. They are relatively mild, and are therefore classified as "type II" defects.<ref name=crowther>{{cite journal |author=Crowther MA, Kelton JG |title=Congenital thrombophilic states associated with venous thrombosis: a qualitative overview and proposed classification system |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=138 |issue=2 |pages=128–34 |year=2003 |pmid=12529095  |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/138/2/128 | laysummary=http://www.annals.org/content/138/2/I-39.full}}</ref> The most common ones are [[factor V Leiden]] (a mutation in the ''[[factor V|F5]]'' gene at position 1691) and [[prothrombin G20210A]], a mutation in [[prothrombin]] (at position 20210 in the [[Three prime untranslated region|3' untranslated region]] of the gene).<ref name=Kumar4>{{cite book |author=Mitchell RS, Kumar V, Abbas AK, Fausto N |title=Robbins Basic Pathology| chapter=Chapter 4|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= 2007|pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |edition=Eighth}}</ref><ref name=Rosendaal2005>{{cite journal |author=Rosendaal FR |title=Venous thrombosis: the role of genes, environment, and behavior |journal=Hematology Am. Soc. Hematol. Educ.

The rare forms of congenital thrombophilia are typically caused by a deficiency of natural anticoagulants. They are classified as "type I" and are more severe in their propensity to cause thrombosis.<ref name=crowther/> The main ones are [[Antithrombin|antithrombin III]] deficiency, [[protein C deficiency]] and [[protein S deficiency]].<ref name=Kumar4/><ref name=Rosendaal2005/> Milder rare congenital thrombophilias are [[factor XIII]] mutation<ref name=Rosendaal2005/> and [[familial dysfibrinogenemia]] (an abnormal [[fibrinogen]]).<ref name=Rosendaal2005/> It is unclear whether congenital disorders of [[fibrinolysis]] (the system that destroys clots) are major contributors to thrombosis risk.<ref name=crowther/> Congenital deficiency of [[plasminogen]], for instance, mainly causes eye symptoms and sometimes problems in other organs, but the link with thrombosis has been more uncertain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mehta R, Shapiro AD |title=Plasminogen deficiency |journal=Haemophilia |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=1261–8 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=19141167 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2516.2008.01825.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2516.2008.01825.x/full}}</ref>

[[ABO blood group system|Blood group]] determines thrombosis risk to a significant extent. Those with blood groups other than type&nbsp;O are at a two- to fourfold relative risk. Those with type&nbsp;O have lower levels of the blood protein [[von Willebrand factor]] as well as [[factor VIII]], which confers protection from thrombosis.<ref name=RosendaalReitsma>{{cite journal |author=Rosendaal FR, Reitsma PH |title=Genetics of venous thrombosis |journal=J.

===Acquired===
A number of acquired conditions augment the risk of thrombosis. A prominent example is [[antiphospholipid syndrome]],<ref name=Kumar4/><ref name=Rosendaal2005/> which is caused by [[antibodies]] against constituents of the cell membrane, particularly [[lupus anticoagulant]] (first found in people with the disease [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] but often detected in people without the disease), [[anti-cardiolipin antibodies]], and [[Anti-apolipoprotein antibodies|anti-β<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein 1 antibodies]]; it is therefore regarded as an [[autoimmune disease]]. In some cases antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial as well as venous thrombosis. It is also more strongly associated with miscarriage, and can cause a number of other symptoms (such as [[livedo reticularis]] of the skin and [[migraine]]).<ref name=Antiphospholipid>{{cite journal |author=Ruiz-Irastorza G, Crowther M, Branch W, Khamashta MA |title=Antiphospholipid syndrome |journal=Lancet |volume=376 |issue=9751 |pages=1498–509 |year=2010 |month=October |pmid=20822807 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60709-X}}</ref>

[[Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia]] (HIT) is due to an immune system reaction against the anticoagulant drug [[heparin]] (or its derivatives).<ref name=Kumar4/>  Though it is named for associated low platelet counts, HIT is strongly associated with risk of venous and arterial thrombosis.<ref name=Keeling>{{cite journal |author=Keeling D, Davidson S, Watson H |title=The management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia |journal=Br. J. Haematol. |volume=133 |issue=3 |pages=259–69 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16643427 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06018.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118607806/HTMLSTART}}</ref>  [[Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]] (PNH) is a rare condition resulting from acquired alterations in the ''[[PIGA]]'' gene, which plays a role in the protection of blood cells from the [[complement system]]. PNH increases the risk of venous thrombosis but is also associated with [[hemolytic anemia]] (anemia resulting from destruction of red blood cells).<ref name=Brodsky>{{cite journal |author=Brodsky RA |title=Narrative review: paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: the physiology of complement-related hemolytic anemia |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=148 |issue=8 |pages=587–95 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18413620 |url=http://www.annals.org/content/148/8/587.full}}</ref> Both HIT and PNH require particular treatment.<ref name=Keeling/><ref name=Brodsky/> 

Hematologic conditions associated with sluggish blood flow can increase risk for thrombosis. For example, [[sickle-cell disease]] (caused by mutations of [[hemoglobin]]) is regarded as a mild prothrombotic state induced by impaired flow.<ref name=Kumar4/>  Similarly, [[myeloproliferative disorder]]s, in which the bone marrow produces too many blood cells, predispose to thrombosis, particularly in [[polycythemia vera]] (excess red blood cells) and [[essential thrombocytosis]] (excess platelets). Again, these conditions usually warrant specific treatment when identified.<ref name=MPD>{{cite journal |author=Papadakis E, Hoffman R, Brenner B |title=Thrombohemorrhagic complications of myeloproliferative disorders |journal=Blood Rev. |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=227–32 |year=2010 |month=November |pmid=20817333 |doi=10.1016/j.blre.2010.08.002}}</ref>

[[Cancer]], particularly when [[metastasis|metastatic]] (spread to other places in the body), is a recognised risk factor for thrombosis.<ref name=Heit/><ref name=Rosendaal2005/> A number of mechanisms have been proposed, such as activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances. Furthermore, particular cancer treatments (such as the use of [[central venous catheter]]s for [[chemotherapy]]) may increase the risk of thrombosis further.<ref name=Prandoni>{{cite journal |author=Prandoni P, Falanga A, Piccioli A |title=Cancer and venous thromboembolism |journal=Lancet Oncol. |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=401–10 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15925818 |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(05)70207-2}}</ref>

[[Nephrotic syndrome]], in which protein from the bloodstream is released into the urine due to kidney diseases, can predispose to thrombosis;<ref name=Kumar4/> this is particularly the case in more severe cases (as indicated by blood levels of [[albumin]] below 25&nbsp;g/l) and if the syndrome is caused by the condition [[Membranous glomerulonephritis|membranous nephropathy]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hull RP, Goldsmith DJ |title=Nephrotic syndrome in adults |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7654 |pages=1185–9 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18497417 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39576.709711.80 |pmc=2394708}}</ref> [[Inflammatory bowel disease]] ([[ulcerative colitis]] and [[Crohn's disease]]) predispose to thrombosis, particularly when the disease is active.

[[Pregnancy]] is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. This probably results from a physiological [[hypercoagulability in pregnancy]] that protects against [[postpartum hemorrhage]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bourjeily G, Paidas M, Khalil H, Rosene-Montella K, Rodger M |title=Pulmonary embolism in pregnancy |journal=Lancet |volume=375 |issue=9713 |pages=500–12 |year=2010 |month=February |pmid=19889451 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60996-X}}</ref> 

The female hormone [[estrogen]], when used in the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] and in [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|perimenopausal hormone replacement therapy]], has been associated with a two- to sixfold increased risk of venous thrombosis. The risk depends on the type of hormones used, the dose of estrogen, and the presence of other thrombophilic risk factors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gomes MP, Deitcher SR |title=Risk of venous thromboembolic disease associated with hormonal contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy: a clinical review |journal=Arch.

[[Obesity]] has long been regarded as a risk factor for venous thrombosis. It more than doubles the risk in numerous studies, particularly in combination with the use of oral contraceptives or in the period after [[surgery]]. Various coagulation abnormalities have been described in the obese. [[Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1]], an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is present in higher levels in people with obesity. Obese people also have larger numbers of [[circulating microvesicle]]s (fragments of damaged cells) that bear tissue factor. [[Platelet]] aggregation may be increased, and there are higher levels of coagulation proteins such as von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, [[factor VII]] and [[factor VIII]]. Obesity also increases the risk of recurrence after an initial episode of thrombosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stein PD, Goldman J |title=Obesity and thromboembolic disease |journal=Clin. Chest Med. |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=489–93, viii |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19700047 |doi=10.1016/j.ccm.2009.05.006}}</ref>

===Unclear===
A number of conditions that have been linked with venous thrombosis are possibly genetic and possibly acquired.<ref name=Rosendaal2005/> These include: elevated levels of factor VIII, [[factor IX]], [[factor XI]], [[fibrinogen]] and 
[[Carboxypeptidase B2|thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor]], and decreased levels of [[tissue factor pathway inhibitor]]. [[Activated protein C resistance]] that is not attributable to factor V mutations is probably caused by other factors and remains a risk factor for thrombosis.<ref name=Rosendaal2005/>

There is an association between the blood levels of [[homocysteine]] and thrombosis,<ref name=Rosendaal2005/> although this has not been reported consistently in all studies.<ref name=RosendaalReitsma/> Homocysteine levels are determined by mutations in the ''[[Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase|MTHFR]]'' and ''[[Cystathionine beta synthase|CBS]]'' genes, but also by levels of [[folic acid]], [[vitamin B6]] and [[vitamin B12]], which depend on diet.<ref name=crowther/>

==Mechanism==
{{main|Coagulation}}

[[Image:Coagulation full.svg|right|thumb|The coagulation system, often described as a [[Biochemical cascade|"cascade"]], consists of a group of proteins that interact in the formation of a fibrin-rich clot.]]

Thrombosis is a multifactorial problem because there are often multiple reasons why a person might develop thrombosis. These [[risk factor]]s may include any combination of abnormalities in the blood vessel wall, abnormalities in the blood flow (as in immobilization), and abnormalities in the consistency of the blood. Thrombophilia is caused by abnormalities in blood consistency, which is determined by the levels of coagulation factors and other circulating blood proteins that participate in the "coagulation cascade".<ref name=Rosendaal2005/>

Normal coagulation is initiated by the release of [[tissue factor]] from damaged tissue. Tissue factor binds to circulating [[factor VII]]a. The combination activates [[factor X]] to factor Xa and [[factor IX]] to factor IXa. Factor Xa (in the presence of [[factor V]]) activates [[prothrombin]] into thrombin. Thrombin is a central enzyme in the coagulation process: it generates fibrin from [[fibrinogen]], and activates a number of other enzymes and cofactors ([[factor XIII]], [[factor XI]], factor V and [[factor VIII]], TAFI) that enhance the fibrin clot.<ref name=crowther/> The process is inhibited by TFPI (which inactivates the first step catalyzed by factor VIIa/tissue factor), antithrombin (which inactivates thrombin, factor IXa, Xa and XIa), protein C (which inhibits factors Va and VIIIa in the presence of protein S), and [[protein Z]] (which inhibits factor Xa).<ref name=crowther/>

In thrombophilia, the balance between "procoagulant" and "anticoagulant" activity is disturbed. The severity of the imbalance determines the likelihood that someone develops thrombosis. Even small perturbances of proteins, such as the reduction of antithrombin  to only 70–80% of the normal level, can increase the thrombosis risk; this is in contrast with [[hemophilia]], which only arises if levels of coagulation factors are markedly decreased.<ref name=crowther/>

In addition to its effects on thrombosis, hypercoagulable states may accelerate the development of [[atherosclerosis]], the arterial disease that underlies [[myocardial infarction]] and other forms of cardiovascular disease.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Borissoff JI, Spronk HM, Heeneman S, ten Cate H | title=Is thrombin a key player in the 'coagulation-atherogenesis' maze? | journal=Cardiovasc Res. | year=2009 | volume=82 | issue=3 | pages=392–403 | pmid=19228706 | doi=10.1093/cvr/cvp066  |url=http://cardiovascres.oxfordjournals.org/content/82/3/392.long}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Borissoff JI, Spronk HM, ten Cate H | title=The hemostatic system as a modulator of atherosclerosis | journal=N.

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Protein F5 PDB 1czs.png|thumb | right | A mutation of coagulation factor V (schematic representation drawn here) is much more common in people with thrombosis than in those without, but is only regarded as a weak risk factor.]]
Tests for thrombophilia include [[complete blood count]] (with examination of the [[blood film]]), [[prothrombin time]], [[partial thromboplastin time]], [[thrombodynamics test]], [[thrombin time]] and [[reptilase time]], [[lupus anticoagulant]], [[anti-cardiolipin antibody]], [[anti-β2 glycoprotein 1 antibody]], activated protein C resistance, [[fibrinogen]] tests, [[factor V Leiden]] and [[prothrombin]] mutation, and basal [[homocysteine]] levels.<ref name=Heit/> Testing may be more or less extensive depending on clinical judgement and abnormalities detected on initial evaluation.<ref name=Heit/>

There are divergent views as to whether everyone with an unprovoked episode of thrombosis should be investigated for thrombophilia. Even those with a form of thrombophilia may not necessarily be at risk of further thrombosis, while recurrent thrombosis is more likely in those who have had previous thrombosis even in those who have no detectable thrombophilic abnormalities.<ref name=Middeldorp/><ref name=Baglin10/><ref name=Dalen>{{cite journal |author=Dalen JE |title=Should patients with venous thromboembolism be screened for thrombophilia? |journal=Am.

For example, if the thrombosis is due to immobilization after recent [[orthopedic surgery]], it is regarded as "provoked" by the immobilization and the surgery, and it is less likely that investigations will yield clinically important results.<ref name=Baglin10/><ref name=Dalen/>

In the United Kingdom, professional guidelines give specific indications for thrombophilia testing.  It is recommended that testing be done only after appropriate counseling, and hence the investigations are usually not performed at the time when thrombosis is diagnosed but at a later time.<ref name=Baglin10/> In particular situations, such as [[retinal vein thrombosis]], testing is discouraged altogether because thrombophilia is not regarded as a major risk factor. In other rare conditions generally linked with hypercoagulability, such as cerebral venous thrombosis and portal vein thrombosis, there is insufficient data to state for certain whether thrombophilia screening is helpful, and decisions on thrombophilia screening in these conditions are therefore not regarded as [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]].<ref name=Baglin10/> If cost-effectiveness ([[quality-adjusted life year]]s in return for expenditure) is taken as a guide, it is generally unclear whether thrombophilia investigations justify the often high cost,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Simpson EL, Stevenson MD, Rawdin A, Papaioannou D |title=Thrombophilia testing in people with venous thromboembolism: systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis |journal=Health Technol.

[[Recurrent miscarriage]] is an indication for thrombophilia screening, particularly antiphospholipid antibodies (anti-cardiolipin IgG and IgM, as well as lupus anticoagulant), factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation, activated protein C resistance and a general assessment of coagulation through an investigation known as [[thromboelastography]].<ref name=RaiRegan/>

Women who are planning to use oral contraceptives do not benefit from routine screening for thrombophilias, as the absolute risk of thrombotic events is low. If either the woman or a first-degree relative has suffered from thrombosis, the risk of developing thrombosis is increased. Screening this selected group may be beneficial,<ref name=ThrombRes/> but even when negative may still indicate residual risk.<ref name=Baglin10/> Professional guidelines therefore suggest that alternative forms of contraception be used rather than relying on screening.<ref name=Baglin10/>

Thrombophilia screening in people with arterial thrombosis is generally regarded unrewarding and is generally discouraged,<ref name=Baglin10/> except possibly for unusually young patients (especially when precipitated by [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] or use of estrogen-containing [[hormonal contraceptives]]) and those in whom revascularization, such as [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary arterial bypass]], fails because of rapid occlusion of the graft.<ref name=deMoerloose/>

==Treatment==
[[File:Warfarintablets5-3-1.jpg|right|thumb|People considered to be at a high risk of repeated thrombosis due to thrombophilia are often advised to take warfarin for prolonged periods of time or even indefinitely.]]
There is no specific treatment for thrombophilia, unless it is caused by an underlying medical illness (such as nephrotic syndrome), in which case the treatment of the underlying disease is needed. In those with unprovoked and/or recurrent thrombosis, or those with a high-risk risk form of thrombophilia, the most important decision is whether to use anticoagulation medications, such as [[warfarin]], on a long-term basis to reduce the risk of further episodes.<ref name=Kyrle10>{{cite journal |author=Kyrle PA, Rosendaal FR, Eichinger S |title=Risk assessment for recurrent venous thrombosis |journal=Lancet |volume=376 |issue=9757 |pages=2032–9 |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=21131039 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60962-2}}</ref> This risk needs to weighed against the risk that the treatment will cause significant bleeding, as the reported risk of major bleeding is over 3% per year, and 11% of those with major bleeding may die as a result.<ref name=Kyrle10/>

Apart from the abovementioned forms of thrombophilia, the risk of recurrence after an episode of thrombosis is determined by factors such as the extent and severity of the original thrombosis, whether it was provoked (such as by immobilization or pregnancy), the number of previous thrombotic events, male sex, the presence of an [[inferior vena cava filter]], the presence of cancer, symptoms of [[post-thrombotic syndrome]], and [[obesity]].<ref name=Kyrle10/> These factors tend to be more important in the decision than the presence or absence of a detectable thrombophilia.<ref name=Baglin10/><ref name=Kearon>{{cite journal |author=Kearon C, Kahn SR, Agnelli G, Goldhaber S, Raskob GE, Comerota AJ |title=Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition) |journal=Chest |volume=133 |issue=6 Suppl |pages=454S–545S |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18574272 |doi=10.1378/chest.08-0658 |url=http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/133/6_suppl/454S.full}}</ref>

Those with antiphospholipid syndrome may be offered long-term anticoagulation after a first unprovoked episode of thrombosis. The risk is determined by the subtype of antibody detected, by the [[antibody titer]] (amount of antibodies), whether multiple antibodies are detected, and whether it is detected repeatedly or only on a single occasion.<ref name=Antiphospholipid/>

Women with a thrombophilia who are contemplating pregnancy or are pregnant usually require alternatives to warfarin during pregnancy, especially in the first 13 weeks, when it may produce abnormalities in the unborn child. [[Low molecular weight heparin]] (LMWH, such as [[enoxaparin]]) is generally used as an alternative.<ref name=Bates>{{cite journal |author=Bates SM, Greer IA, Pabinger I, Sofaer S, Hirsh J |title=Venous thromboembolism, thrombophilia, antithrombotic therapy, and pregnancy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition) |journal=Chest |volume=133 |issue=6 Suppl |pages=844S–886S |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18574280 |doi=10.1378/chest.08-0761 |url=http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/133/6_suppl/844S.long}}</ref> Warfarin and LMWH may safely be used in breastfeeding.<ref name=Bates/>

==Prognosis==
In people without a detectable thrombophilia, the cumulative risk of developing thrombosis by the age of 60 is about 12%. About 60% of people who are deficient in antithrombin will have experienced thrombosis at least once by age 60, as will about 50% of people with protein C deficiency and about a third of those with protein S deficiency. People with activated protein C resistance (usually resulting from factor V Leiden), in contrast, have a slightly raised absolute risk of thrombosis, with 15% having had at least one thrombotic event by the age of sixty.<ref name=crowther/> In general, men are more likely than women to experience repeated episodes of venous thrombosis.<ref name=RosendaalReitsma/>

People with factor V Leiden are at a relatively low risk of thrombosis, but may develop thrombosis in the presence of an additional risk factor, such as immobilization. Most people with the prothrombin mutation (G20210A) never develop thrombosis.<ref name=crowther/>

==Epidemiology==
The major ("type 1") thrombophilias are rare. Antithrombin deficiency is present in 0.2% of the general population and 0.5–7.5% of people with venous thrombosis. Protein C deficiency, too, is present in 0.2% of the population, and can be found in 2.5–6% of people with thrombosis. The exact prevalence of protein S deficiency in the population is unknown; it is found 1.3–5% of people with thrombosis.<ref name=crowther/>

The minor ("type 2") thrombophilias are much more common. Factor V Leiden is present in 5% of the population of Northern European descent, but much rarer in those of Asian or African extraction. In people with thrombosis, 10% have factor V Leiden. In those who are referred for thrombophilia testing, 30–50% have the defect. The prothrombin mutation occurs at rates of 1–4% in the general population, 5–10% of people with thrombosis, and 15% of people referred for thrombophilia testing. Like factor V Leiden, this abnormality is uncommon in Africans and Asians.<ref name=crowther/>

The exact prevalence of antiphospholipid syndrome is not well known, as different studies employ different definitions of the condition. Antiphospholipid antibodies are detected in 24% of those referred to thrombophilia testing.<ref name=Antiphospholipid/>

==History==
[[File:Rudolf Virchow.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Rudolf Virchow, the German pathologist who distinguished the various causes of thrombosis, and whose work led to the development of thrombophilia as a concept.]]
German physician [[Rudolf Virchow]] categorized abnormalities in the consistency of the blood as a factor in the development of thrombosis in 1856. The exact nature of these abnormalities remained elusive until the first form of thrombophilia, [[antithrombin deficiency]], was recognized in 1965 by the Norwegian hematologist Olav Egeberg.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Egeberg O |title=Inherited antithrombin deficiency causing thrombophilia |journal=Thromb.

The more common genetic thrombophilias were described in the 1990s. Many studies had previously indicated that many people with thrombosis showed resistance activated protein C. In 1994 a group in [[Leiden]], The Netherlands, identified the most common underlying defect—a mutation in factor V that made it resistant to the action of activated protein C. The defect was called ''factor V Leiden'', as genetic abnormalities are typically named after the place where they are discovered.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bertina RM, Koeleman BP, Koster T, ''et al.'' |title=Mutation in blood coagulation factor V associated with resistance to activated protein C |journal=Nature |volume=369 |issue=6475 |pages=64–7 |year=1994 |month=May |pmid=8164741 |doi=10.1038/369064a0}}</ref> Two years later, the same group described a common mutation in the prothrombin gene that caused elevation of prothrombin levels and a mild increase in thrombosis risk.<ref name=Dahlback/><ref name=RosendaalReitsma/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Poort SR, Rosendaal FR, Reitsma PH, Bertina RM |title=A common genetic variation in the 3'-untranslated region of the prothrombin gene is associated with elevated plasma prothrombin levels and an increase in venous thrombosis |journal=Blood |volume=88 |issue=10 |pages=3698–703 |year=1996 |month=November |pmid=8916933 |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/reprint/88/10/3698 | format=PDF}}</ref>

It is suspected that other genetic abnormalities underlying familial thrombosis will in future be discovered through [[genome-wide association study|studies of the entire genetic code]], looking for [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|small alternations in genes]].<ref name=Dahlback/><ref name=RosendaalReitsma/>
