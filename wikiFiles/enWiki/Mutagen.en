In [[genetics]], a '''mutagen''' ([[Latin]], literally ''origin of change'') is a physical or chemical agent that changes the genetic material, usually [[DNA]], of an [[organism]] and thus increases the frequency of [[mutation]]s above the natural background level. As many mutations cause [[cancer]], mutagens are therefore also likely to be [[carcinogen]]s. Not all mutations are caused by mutagens: so-called "spontaneous mutations" occur due to spontaneous [[hydrolysis]], [[DNA error|errors]] in [[DNA replication]], repair and [[Genetic recombination|recombination]].

== Discovery of mutagens ==
The first mutagens to be identified were [[carcinogen]]s, substances that were shown to be linked to [[cancer]]. [[Tumor]]s were described more than 2,000 years before the discovery of [[chromosome]]s and [[DNA]]; in 500 B.C., the [[Greece|Greek]] [[physician]] [[Hippocrates]] named tumors resembling a crab ''karkinos'' (from which the word "cancer" is derived via Latin), meaning crab.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1245/s10434-009-0886-6/fulltext.html |title=Ancient Greek and Greco–Roman Methods in Modern Surgical Treatment of Cancer |author=Niki Papavramidou, Theodossis Papavramidis, and Thespis Demetriou |journal=Annals of Surgical Oncology |year=2010 |volume=17|issue=3|pages=665–7 |doi= 10.1245/s10434-009-0886-6 |pmid= 20049643}}</ref>  In 1567, Swiss physician [[Paracelsus]] suggested unidentified substance in mined ore (identified as [[radon]] gas in modern times) caused a wasting disease in miners,<ref name="medscape">[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/499098_2 Nature and Nurture - Lessons from Chemical Carcinogenesis: Chemical Carcinogens — From Past to Present]</ref> and in England, in 1761, [[John Hill (author)|John Hill]] made the first direct link of cancer to chemical substances by noting that excessive use of [[snuff]] may cause nasal cancer.<ref>Hill, J.

The mutagenic property of mutagens was first demonstrated in 1927, when [[Hermann Joseph Muller|Hermann Muller]] discovered that [[x-ray]]s can cause genetic mutations in [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]], producing [[phenotype|phenotypic]] mutants as well as observable changes to the chromosomes.<ref>{{pmid|17802387 }}</ref> His collaborator Edgar Altenburg also demonstrated the mutational effect of UV radiation in 1928.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/2457052 The limit of radiation frequency effective in producing mutations] Altenburg, E.

==Effects of mutagens==
{{main|Mutagenesis }}
Mutagens cause changes to the DNA that can affect the transcription and replication of the DNA, which in severe cases can lead to cell death.  The mutagen produces mutations in the DNA, and deleterious mutation can result in aberrant, impaired or loss of function for a particular gene, and accumulation of mutations may lead to cancer. 

Different mutagens act on the DNA differently.  Powerful mutagens may result in chromosomal instability,<ref>{{pmid|12947391 }}</ref> causing chromosomal breakages and rearrangement of the chromosomes such as [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]], [[Deletion (genetics)|deletion]], and [[Chromosomal inversion|inversion]].  Such mutagens are called [[clastogen]]s.  

Mutagens may also modify the DNA sequence; the changes in [[nucleic acid]] sequences by mutations include substitution of [[nucleotide]] [[base-pair]]s and [[insertional mutation|insertions]] and [[deletion (genetics)|deletions]] of one or more nucleotides in DNA sequences. Although some of these mutations are lethal or cause serious disease, many have minor effects as they do not result in residue changes that have significant effect on the structure and function of the [[protein]]s.  Many mutations are [[silent mutation]]s, causing no visible effects at all, either because they occur in non-coding or non-functional sequences, or they do not change the [[amino-acid]] sequence due to the [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] of [[codon]]s. 
    
Some mutagens can cause [[aneuploidy]] and change the number of chromosomes in the cell. 

In Ames test, where the varying concentrations of the chemical are used in the test, the dose response curve obtained is nearly always linear, suggesting that there is no threshold for mutagenesis.  Similar results are also obtained in studies with radiations, indicating that there may be no safe threshold for mutagens.  However, some proposed that low level of some mutagens may stimulate the DNA repair processes and therefore may not necessarily be harmful.

==Types of mutagens==
Mutagens may be of physical, chemical or biological origin.  They may act directly on the DNA, causing  direct damage to the DNA, and most often result in replication error.  Some however may act on the replication mechanism and chromosomal partition.  Many mutagens are not mutagenic by themselves, but can form mutagenic metabolites through cellular processes.  Such mutagens are called promutagens.

===Physical mutagens===
* [[Ionizing radiation]]s such as [[X-rays]], [[gamma ray]]s and [[alpha particle]]s may cause DNA breakage and other damages.
* [[Ultraviolet]] radiations with wavelength above 260&nbsp;nm are absorbed strongly by bases, producing [[pyrimidine dimers]], which can cause error in replication if left uncorrected.
* [[Radioactive decay]], such as [[Carbon-14|<sup>14</sup>C]] in DNA which decays into [[nitrogen]].

===DNA reactive chemicals===
[[Image:Benzopyrene DNA adduct 1JDG.png|thumb |right |200px |A [[DNA adduct]] (at center) of [[Benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]], the major mutagen in [[tobacco smoking|tobacco smoke]].]]
A large number of chemicals may interact directly with DNA.  However, many such as PAHs, aromatic amines, benzene are not necessarily mutagenic by themselves, but through metabolic processes in cells they produce mutagenic compounds.

* [[Reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) - These may be [[superoxide]], [[hydroxyl radicals]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]], and large number of these highly reactive species are generated by normal cellular processes, for example as a by-products of mitochondrial [[Electron transport chain|electron transport]], or [[lipid peroxidation]].  A number of mutagens may also generate these ROS.
* [[Deamination|Deaminating]] agents such as [[nitrous acid]]
* [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] (PAH)
* [[Alkylation|Alkylating]] agents such as [[ethylnitrosourea]].  The compounds transfer methyl or ethyl group to bases or the backbone phosphate groups.  Guanine when alkylated may be mispaired with thiamine.  Some may cause DNA crosslinking and breakages. [[Nitrosamine]]s are an important group of mutagens found in tobacco, and may also be formed in smoked meats and fish via the interaction of amines in food with nitrites added as preservatives.  Other alkylating agents include mustard gas and [[vinyl chloride]].
* [[Aromatic amines]] and amides have been associated with carcinogenesis since 1895 when German physician [[Ludwig Rehn]] observed high incidence of bladder cancer among workers in German synthetic aromatic amine dye industry.   [[2-Acetylaminofluorene]], originally used as a pesticide but may also be found in cooked meat, may cause cancer of the bladder, liver, ear, intestine, thyroid and breast.
* [[Alkaloid]] from plants, such as those from [[Vinca]] species{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}, may be converted by metabolic processes into the active mutagen or carcinogen
* [[Bromine]] and some compounds that contain bromine in their chemical structure
* [[Sodium azide]], an azide salt that is a common reagent in organic synthesis and a component in many car airbag systems
* [[Psoralen]] combined with ultraviolet radiation causes DNA cross-linking and hence chromosome breakage
* [[Benzene]], an industrial solvent and precursor in the production of drugs, plastics, synthetic rubber and dyes.

===Base analogs===
* [[Base analog]], which can substitute for DNA bases and cause transition mutations.

===Intercalating agents===
* [[Intercalation (chemistry)|Intercalating agents]], such as [[ethidium bromide]] and [[proflavine]], are molecules that may insert between bases in DNA, causing [[frameshift mutation]] during replication.  Some such as [[daunorubicin]] may block transcription and replication, making them highly toxic to proliferating cells.

===Metals===
Many metals, such as [[arsenic]], [[cadmium]], [[chromium]], [[nickel]] and their compounds may be mutagenic, they may however act via different mechanisms.<ref>{{cite pmid|15892631 }}</ref>  Arsenic, chromium, iron, and nickel may be associated with the production of reactive oxygen species, and some of these may also alter the fidelity of DNA replication.  Nickel may also be linked to DNA hypermethylation and [[histone]] deacetylation, while cadmium may inhibit DNA mismatch repair.

===Biological agents===
* [[Transposon]], a section of DNA that undergoes autonomous fragment relocation/multiplication.  Its insertion into chromosomal DNA disrupt functional elements of the genes.
* [[Virus]] - Virus DNA may be inserted into the genome and disrupts genetic function. Infectious agents have been suggested to cause cancer as early as 1908 by Vilhelm Ellermann and Oluf Bang,<ref>{{cite journal |author= Ellermann V., Bang O. |title=Experimentelle Leukämie bei Hühnern |journal=Zentralbl. Bakteriol. Parasitenkd. Infectionskr. Hyg. Abt. Orig. |year=1908 |volume=46 |pages=595–609 }}</ref> and 1911 by [[Peyton Rous]] who discovered the [[Rous sarcoma virus]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=A sarcoma of the fowl transmissible by an agent separable from the tumor cells |author=Peyton Rous |journal=Journal of Experimental Medicine |year= 1911 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=397–411 |url= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2124874/pdf/397.pdf }}</ref>
* [[Bacteria]] - some bacteria such as ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' cause inflammation during which oxidative species are produced, causing DNA damage by reducing efficiency of DNA repair systems thereby increasing mutation.

==Protection against mutagens==
[[File:Fruits veggies.png|thumb|right|Fruits and vegetable are rich in antioxidants.]]

[[Antioxidant]]s are an important group of [[anticarcinogenic]] compounds that may help remove ROS or potentially harmful chemicals.  These may be found naturally in [[fruit]]s and [[vegetables]].<ref name="carcinogens and anticarcinogens">{{cite book |title=Carcinogens and Anticarcinogens in the Human Diet |publisher=National Academy Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-309-05391-9 }}</ref>  Examples of antioxidants are [[vitamin A]] and its [[carotenoid]] precursors, [[vitamin C]], [[vitamin E]], [[polyphenol]]s, and various other compounds.  [[beta-Carotene|β-Carotene]] is the red-orange colored compounds found in vegetables like [[carrot]]s and [[tomatoes]].  Vitamin C may prevent some cancers by inhibiting the formation of mutagenic [[N-nitroso]] compounds (nitrosamine).  [[Flavonoid]]s, such as [[Epigallocatechin gallate|EGCG]] in [[green tea]], have also been shown to be effective antioxidants and may have anti-cancer properties.  Epidemiological studies indicate that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is associated with lower incidence of some cancers and longer life expectancy,<ref name="pmid22684632"/> however, the effectiveness of antioxidant supplements in cancer prevention in general is still the subject of some debate.<ref name="pmid22684632">{{cite journal |title=Antioxidant vitamins and mineral supplementation, life span expansion and cancer incidence: a critical commentary |author=Dolara P, Bigagli E, Collins A. |journal=Eur J Nutr. |volume=51 |issue=7|pages=769–81 |year=2012 |pmid= 22684632 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Vitamin/mineral supplementation and cancer, cardiovascular, and all-cause mortality in a German prospective cohort |author=Li K, Kaaks R, Linseisen J, Rohrmann S. |journal=Eur J Nutr. |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=407–13 |year=2012 |pmid=21779961 }}</ref>

Other chemicals may reduce mutagenesis via other mechanisms, although for some the precise mechanism for their protective property may not be certain.  [[Selenium]], which is present as a micronutrient in vegetables, is a component of important antioxidant enzymes such as gluthathione peroxidase.  Many phytonutrients may counter the effect of mutagens; for example, [[sulforaphane]] in vegetables such as [[broccoli]] has been shown to be protective against [[prostate cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Sulforaphane destabilizes the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells by inactivating histone deacetylase 6 |author=Gibbs A, Schwartzman J, Deng V, Alumkal J |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. |volume=106 |issue=39|pages=16663–8 |year=2009 |pmid=19805354 |pmc=2757849 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0908908106}}</ref>  Others that may be effective against cancer include [[indole-3-carbinol]] from [[cruciferous vegetables]] and [[resveratrol]] from red wine.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Cancer prevention with natural compounds |author=Gullett NP, Ruhul Amin AR, Bayraktar S, Pezzuto JM, Shin DM, Khuri FR, Aggarwal BB, Surh YJ, Kucuk O |journal=Seminars in Oncology |volume=37 |issue=3|pages=258–81 |year=2010 |pmid=20709209 |doi=10.1053/j.seminoncol.2010.06.014}}</ref>

An effective precautionary measure an individual can undertake to protect themselves is by limiting exposure to mutagens such as UV radiations and tobacco smoke.  In Australia, where people with pale skin are often exposed to strong sunlight, [[melanoma]] is the most common cancer diagnosed in people aged 15–44 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org.au/cancersmartlifestyle/SunSmart/Skincancerfactsandfigures.htm| title=Skin Cancer Facts and Figures|date=|accessdate= 2010-07-02}}</ref><ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13922-skintone-gene-could-predict-cancer-risk.html Skin-tone gene could predict cancer risk]</ref>

In 1981, human epidemiological analysis by [[Richard Doll]] and [[Richard Peto]] indicated that smoking caused 30% of cancers in the US.<ref>{{cite pmid|7017215 }}</ref>  Doll and Peto also estimated that diet may cause  around 35% of cancers. Mutagens identified in food include [[mycotoxin]]s from food contaminated with fungal growths, such as: [[aflatoxins]] which may be present in contaminated peanuts (prevalent in Southern China) and corn; [[heterocyclic amine]]s generated in meat when cooked at high temperature; PAHs in charred meat and smoked fish, as well as in oils, fats, bread, and cereal;<ref name="PAH in diet">{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out154_en.pdf |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons - Occurrence in foods, dietary exposure and health effects |author=Scientific Committee on Food |date=4 December 2002 |work= |publisher=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref> and nitrosamines generated from nitrites used as food preservatives in [[cured meat]] such as [[bacon]] ([[Vitamin C|ascobate]], which is added to cured meat, however, reduces nitrosamine formation).<ref name="carcinogens and anticarcinogens"/>  Excessive  [[Alcohol and cancer|alcohol consumption]] has also been linked to cancer; The possible mechanisms for its carcinogenicity include formation of the possible mutagen [[acetaldehyde]] and the induction of the [[cytochrome P450]] system which is known to produce mutagenic compounds from promutagens.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Pöschl G, Seitz HK |title=Alcohol and cancer |journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=155–65 |year=2004 |pmid=15082451 |doi=10.1093/alcalc/agh057}}</ref> 

For certain mutagens, such as dangerous chemicals and radiations, as well as infectious agents known to cause cancer, government legislations and regulatory bodies are necessary for their control.

==Mutagen test systems==
Many different systems for detecting mutagen have been developed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hodgson |first1=Ernest |edition=3rd |year=2004 |title = A Textbook of Modern Toxicology |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |chapter=Chapter 21 |isbn=0-471-26508-X }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Phillip L. |last2= James |first2=Robert C. |last3= Roberts |first3=Stephen M. |edition=2nd |year=2000 |title = Principles of Toxicology - Environmental and Industrial
Applications |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=0-471-29321-0 }}</ref>  Animal systems may more accurately reflect the metabolism of human, however, they are expensive and time-consuming (may take around three years to complete), they are therefore not used as a first screen for mutagenicity or carcinogenicity.

=== Bacterial systems ===
{{main|Ames test}}

* '''Ames test''' - This is the most commonly used test using ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]'' strains deficient in [[histidine]] biosynthesis.  The test checks for mutants that can revert to wild-type. It is an easy, inexpensive and convenient initial screen for mutagens.
  
* '''Resistance to 8-azaguanine in ''S. typhimurium''''' - Similar to Ames test, but instead of reverse mutation, it checks for forward mutation that confer resistance to [[8-Azaguanine]] in a histidine revertant strain.

* '''''Escherichia coli'' systems''' - Both forward and reverse mutation detection system have been modified for use in ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.  [[Tryptophan]]-deficient mutant is used for the reverse mutation, while  galactose utility or resistance to 5-methyltryptophan may be used for forward mutation.

* '''DNA repair''' -  ''E. coli'' and ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' strains deficient in DNA repair may be used to detect mutagens by their effect on the growth of these cells through DNA damage.

=== Yeast ===
Systems similar to Ames test have been developed in yeast. ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' is general used.  These systems can check for forward and reverse mutations, as well as recombinant events.

=== ''Drosophila'' ===
'''[[Sex linkage|Sex-Linked]] Recessive Lethal Test''' - Males from a strain with yellow bodies are used in this test. The gene for the yellow body lies on the X-chromosome.  The fruit flies are fed on a diet of test chemical, and progenies are separated by sex.  The surviving males are crossed with the females of the same generation, and if no males with yellow bodies are detected in the second generation, it would indicate a lethal mutation on the X-chromosome has occurred.

===Plant Assays===
Plants such as ''[[Zea mays]]'', ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' and ''[[Tradescantia]]'' have been used in various test assays for mutagenecity of chemicals.

===Cell culture assay===
Mammalian cell lines such as Chinese hamster V79 cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells or mouse lymphoma cells may be used to test for mutagenesis.  Such systems include the '''[[Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase|HPRT]] assay''' for resistance to 8-azaguanine or [[6-thioguanine]], and '''[[ouabain]]-resistance (OUA) assay'''.

Rat primary hepatocytes may also be used to measure DNA repair following DNA damage.  Mutagens may stimulate unscheduled DNA synthesis that results in more stained nuclear material in cells following exposure to mutagens.

===Chromosome check systems===
These systems check for large scale changes to the chromosomes and may be used with cell culture or in animal test.  The chromosomes are stained and observed for any changes.  '''Sister chromatid exchange''' is a symmetrical exchange of chromosome material between sister chromatids and may be correlated to the mutagenic or carcinogenic potential of a chemical.  In '''micronucleus Test''', cells are examined for micronuclei, which are fragments or chromosomes left behind at anaphase, and is therefore a test for clastogenic agents that cause chromosome breakages.  Other tests may check for various chromosomal aberrations such as chromatid and chromosomal gaps and deletions, translocations, and ploidy.

===Animal test systems===
[[Rodents]] are usually used in [[Animal testing on rodents|animal test]].  The chemicals under
test are usually  administered in the food and in the drinking water, but sometimes by dermal application, by [[Feeding tube|gavage]], or by inhalation, and carried out over the major part of the life span for rodents.  In tests that check for carcinogens, maximum tolerated dosage is first determined, then a range of doses are given to around 50 animals throughout the notional lifespan of the animal of two years.  After death the animals are examined for sign of tumours.    Differences in metabolism between rat and human however means that human may not respond in exactly the same way to mutagen, and dosages that produce tumors on the animal test may also be unreasonably high for a human, i.e. the equivalent amount required to produce tumors in human may far exceed what a person might encounter in real life.
  
Mice with recessive mutations for a visible phenotype may also be used to check for mutagens.  Females with recessive mutation crossed with wild-type males would yield the same phenotype as the wild-type, and any observable change to the phenotype would indicate that a mutation induced by the mutagen has occurred.
  
Mice may also be used for '''dominant lethal assays''' where early embryonic deaths are monitored.  Male mice are treated with chemicals under test, mated with females, and the females are then sacrificed before parturition and early fetal deaths are counted in the [[uterine horns]].
  
'''[[Genetically modified mouse|Transgenic Mouse]] Assay''' using a mouse strain infected with a viral [[shuttle vector]] is another method for testing mutagens.  Animals are first treated with suspected mutagen, the mouse DNA is then isolated and the phage segment recovered and used to infect ''E. coli''.  Using similar method as the [[blue-white screen]], the plaque formed with DNA containing mutation are white, while those without are blue.

== Use of mutagen in anti-cancer therapy ==
Many mutagens are highly toxic to proliferating cells, and they are often used to destroy cancer cells.  Alkylating agents such as [[cyclophosphamide]] and [[cisplatin]], as well as intercalating agent such as [[daunorubicin]] and [[doxorubicin]] may be used in chemotherapy. Ionizing radiations are used in [[radiation therapy]].

== Mutagens in fiction ==
{{main|List of mutagens in fiction }}
In [[science fiction]], mutagens are often represented as substances that are capable of completely changing the form of the recipient. This is seen in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] franchise, [[comic book]]s such as [[Marvel Comics]]'s [[Inhumans (comics)|Inhumans]], television series, computer and video games, like the ''[[Cyberia (video game)|Cyberia]]'', ''[[The Witcher]]'', ''[[Metroid Prime: Trilogy]]'', ''[[Resistance: Fall of Man]]'', ''[[Resident Evil]]'', ''[[Infamous (video game)|Infamous]]'', ''[[Command & Conquer]]'', ''[[Gears of War 3]]'', and ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]''.
