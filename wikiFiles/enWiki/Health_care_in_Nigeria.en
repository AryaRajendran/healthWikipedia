'''Health care provision in [[Nigeria]]''' is a concurrent responsibility of the three [[tiers]] of [[government]] in the country.<ref>Rais Akhtar; Health Care Patterns and Planning in Developing Countries, Greenwood Press, 1991. pp 264</ref> However, because [[Nigeria]] operates a [[mixed economy]], private providers of health care have a visible role to play in health care delivery. The [[federal government]]'s role is mostly limited to coordinating the affairs of the [[university]] [[teaching hospital]]s, [[Federal Medical Centres]] (tertiary health care) while the state government manages the various [[hospital|general hospital]]s (secondary health care) and the [[local government]] focus on [[dispensaries]] (primary health care),<ref>{{cite web|title=Federal Medical Centre Abeokuta: A Case Study in Hospital Management pp 1|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/21999635/Federal-Medical-Centre_-Abeokuta_-A-Case-Study-in-Hospital-Management|publisher=docstoc|accessdate=13 June 2011}}</ref> (which are regulated by the federal government through [[NPHCDA]]). The total expenditure on health care as % of GDP is 4.6, while the percentage of federal government expenditure on health care is about 1.5%.<ref>Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 18</ref> A [[long run]] indicator of the ability of the country to provide [[food]] sustenance and avoid [[malnutrition]] is the rate of growth of per capita food production; from 1970–1990, the rate for Nigeria was 0.25%.<ref>Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 1-18</ref>  Though small, the positive rate of per capita may be due to Nigeria's [[importation]] of food products.

==Health insurance==
Historically, [[health insurance]] in Nigeria can be applied to a few instances: free health care provided and financed for all [[citizens]], [[health care]] provided by [[government]] through a special health insurance scheme for government employees and private firms entering contracts with private health care providers.<ref>Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 101-102</ref> However, there are few people who fall within the three instances. 

In May 1999, the government created the [[National Health Insurance]] Scheme, the scheme encompasses [[government]] [[employees]], the organized [[private sector]] and the [[informal sector]]. [[Legislative]] wise, the scheme also covers children under five, permanently disabled persons and prison inmates. In 2004, the administration of Obasanjo further gave more legislative powers to the scheme with positive amendments to the original 1999 legislative act.<ref>Felicia Monye; 'An Appraisal of the National Health Insurance Scheme of Nigeria', Commonwealth Law Bulletin, 32:3 415-427</ref>

==Mental health==
The majority of [[mental health]] services is provided by 8 regional [[psychiatric]] centers and psychiatric departments and [[medical schools]] of 12 major universities. A few general hospitals also provide mental health services. The formal centres often face competition from native [[herbalists]] and [[faith healing]] centres. 

The ratio of psychologists and social workers is 0.02 to 100,000.<ref>Oyedeji Ayonrinde, Oye Gureje, Rahmaan Lawal; 'Psychiatric research in Nigeria: bridging tradition and modernisation', The [[British Journal of Psychiatry]] (2004) 184: 536-538</ref>

==Issues==
===Regulation of pharmaceuticals===
In 1989 legislation made effective a list of [[essential drugs]]. The regulation was also meant to limit the [[manufacture]] and import of [[counterfeit|fake]] or sub-standard [[drugs]] and to curtail [[false advertising]]. However, the section on essential drugs was later amended.<ref>National Drug Policy in Nigeria, O. Ransome Kuti. Journal of Public Health Policy > Vol. 13, No. 3 (Autumn, 1992), pp. 367-373</ref> 

Drug quality is primarily controlled by the [[National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control]] (NAFDAC).  Several major regulatory failures have produced international scandals:

*In 1993, adulterated [[paracetamol]] syrup entered into the health care system in Oyo and [[Benue State]], the end result of was the death of 100 children. A year after the disaster, batches containing poisonous [[ethylene glycol]], the major cause of the deaths, could still be purchased.
*In 1996, about 11 children died of contamination from an experimental trial of the drug [[trovafloxacin]]. 
*In 2008-2009, at least 84 children died from a brand of contaminated teething medication. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29057225/]

===Geographic inequality===
Health care in Nigeria is influenced by different local and regional factors that impacts the quality or quantity present in one location. Due to the aforementioned, the [[health care system]] in Nigeria has shown spatial variation in terms of availability and quality of facilities in relation to need. However, this is largely as a result of the level of state and [[local government]] involvement and investment in health care programs and [[education]]. Also, the [[Federal Ministry of Health (Nigeria)|Nigerian ministry of health]] usually spend about 70% of its budget in urban areas where 30% of the population resides. It is assumed by some scholars that the health care service is inversely related to the need of patients.<ref>Rais Akhtar; Health Care Patterns and Planning in Developing Countries. Greenwood Press, 1991. 265 pgs.</ref>

===Emigration===
[[File:Nurses in Nigeria.jpg|right|thumb|Retaining health care professionals is an important objective]]

Migration of [[health workforce|health care personnel]] to other countries is a taxing and relevant issue in the health care system of the country. From a [[Supply (economics)|supply]] push factor, a resulting rise in exodus of health care nurses may be due to dramatic factors that make the work unbearable and knowing and presenting changes to arrest the factors may stem a tide.<ref>Darlene A. Clark, Paul F. Clark, James B. Stewart; The Globalization of the Labour Market for Health-Care Professionals. International Labour Review, Vol. 145, 2006</ref> However, because a large number of [[nurses]] and doctors migrating abroad benefited from government funds for education, it poses a challenge to the patriotic identity of citizens and also the rate of return of federal funding of health care education. The state of health care in Nigeria has been worsened by a [[physician shortage]] as a consequence of severe '[[brain drain]]'. Many Nigerian doctors have emigrated to North America and Europe. In 2005, 2,392 Nigeria doctors were practising in the US alone, in UK number was 1,529. Retaining these expensively trained professionals has been identified as an urgent goal.

==Services provided==

===Cancer care===
A new bone marrow donor program, the second in Africa, opened in 2012.<ref name=McNeil>{{cite news

It hopes to expand to include [[cord blood]] donations in the future.<ref name=McNeil/>

==Commercialisation of public health service delivery==
Empirical evidences reveal negative impact of commercialisation of public health service delivery on attainment of the MDGs in Nigeria.<ref>Wadinga Audu; Commercialization of Public Health Service Delivery in Nigeria, GDN Research Project, Nigerian Institute of Social and Economic Research, Ibadan,Nigeria  2009</ref>

==Criticism==
The 2000 WHO report on the performance of health care systems rank the country 187 out of 191.

*The [[life expectancy]] of the country is low and about 20% of children die before the age of 5.
*[[Traffic congestion]] in Lagos, [[environmental pollution]] and [[noise pollution]] are major health issues.
*In 1985, an incidence of [[yellow fever]] devastated a town in Nigeria, leading to the death of 1000 people. In a span of 5 years, the epidemic grew, with a resulting rise in mortality. The vaccine for yellow fever has been in existence since the 1930s.<ref>[http://www.nnma.gov.ng/library/Whocares_Tomori.pdf Nigerian National Merit Award<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Maternal and child healthcare ==
In June 2011, the [[United Nations Population Fund]] released a report on [http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html The State of the World's Midwifery]. It contained new data on the midwifery workforce and policies relating to newborn and maternal mortality for 58 countries. The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Nigeria is 840.  This is compared with 608.3 in 2008 and 473.4 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 143 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 28. The aim of this report is to highlight ways in which the [[Millennium Development Goals]] can be achieved, particularly Goal 4 – Reduce child mortality and Goal 5 – improve maternal death. In Nigeria the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is unavailable and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 23.<ref name="SOWMY">{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html|title=The State Of The World's Midwifery|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|date=Accessed August 2011}}</ref>
