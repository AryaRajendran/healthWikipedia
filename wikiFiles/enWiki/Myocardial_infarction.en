'''Myocardial infarction''' ('''MI''') or '''acute myocardial infarction''' ('''AMI'''), commonly known as a '''heart attack''', results from the partial interruption of [[Blood flow|blood supply]] to a part of the [[myocardium|heart muscle]], causing the [[cardiomyocytes|heart cells]] to be damaged or die. This is most commonly due to occlusion (blockage) of a [[coronary artery]] following the rupture of a [[Vulnerable plaque|vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque]], which is an unstable collection of [[lipids|cholesterol and fatty acids]] and [[white blood cell]]s in the wall of an [[artery]]. The resulting [[ischemia]] (restriction in blood supply) and ensuing [[Hypoxia (medical)|oxygen shortage]], if left untreated for a sufficient period of time, can cause damage or death (''[[infarction]]'') of heart muscle tissue (''[[myocardium]]'').

Typical symptoms of acute myocardial infarction include sudden retrosternal [[chest pain]] (typically radiating to the left arm or left side of the neck), [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[palpitation]]s, [[sweating]], and [[anxiety]] (often described as a sense of impending doom).<ref name="Mallinson 2010 15">{{cite journal | last=Mallinson | first=T | title=Myocardial Infarction | journal=Focus on First Aid | issue=15 | page=15 | year=2010 | url=http://www.focusonfirstaid.co.uk/Magazine/issue15/index.aspx | accessdate=2010-06-08 }}</ref> Women may experience fewer typical symptoms than men, most commonly shortness of breath, weakness, a feeling of indigestion, and [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]].<ref name="Kosuge">{{cite journal | last=Kosuge | first=M | coauthors= Kimura K, Ishikawa T et al. | title=Differences between men and women in terms of clinical features of ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction | journal=Circulation Journal | volume=70 | issue=3 | pages=222–6 | date=March 2006 | pmid=16501283 | url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/circj/70/3/222/_pdf | accessdate=2008-05-31 | doi=10.1253/circj.70.222 }}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref> <span id="silent">A sizeable proportion of myocardial infarctions (22–64%)<ref name = "pmid=21497307">{{cite journal |author=Valensi P, Lorgis L, Cottin Y |title=Prevalence, incidence, predictive factors and prognosis of silent myocardial infarction: a review of the literature |journal=Arch Cardiovasc Dis |volume=104 |issue=3 |pages=178–88 |year=2011 |month=March |pmid=21497307 |doi=10.1016/j.acvd.2010.11.013 }}</ref> are "silent", that is without chest pain or other symptoms.</span>

==Classification==
There are two basic types of acute myocardial infarction based  on pathology:
* Transmural: associated with [[atherosclerosis]] involving a major coronary artery. It can be subclassified into anterior, posterior, inferior, lateral or septal. Transmural infarcts extend through the whole thickness of the heart muscle and are usually a result of complete occlusion of the area's blood supply.<ref name="pmid20144151">{{cite journal | title = [Morphology of acute myocardial infarction at prenecrotic stage] | language = Russian | journal = Kardiologiia | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–8 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20144151 | last1 = Reznik | first1 = AG }}</ref> In addition, on [[ECG]], ST elevation and [[QRS complex|Q waves]] are seen.
* Subendocardial: involving a small area in the subendocardial wall of the left ventricle, ventricular septum, or papillary muscles. The subendocardial area is particularly susceptible to ischemia.<ref name="pmid20144151"/>  In addition, ST depression is seen on ECG.
In the clinical context, a myocardial infarction can be further subclassified into a [[ST elevation MI]] (STEMI) versus a [[non-ST elevation MI]] (non-STEMI) based on ECG changes.<ref name="pmid20372757">{{cite journal | author = Moe KT, Wong P | title = Current trends in diagnostic biomarkers of acute coronary syndrome | journal = Ann.

The phrase ''heart attack'' is sometimes used incorrectly to describe [[sudden cardiac death]], which may or may not be the result of acute myocardial infarction.  A heart attack is different from, but can be the cause of [[cardiac arrest]], which is the stopping of the heartbeat, and [[cardiac arrhythmia]], an abnormal heartbeat. It is also distinct from [[heart failure]], in which the pumping action of the heart is impaired; however severe myocardial infarction may lead to heart failure.<ref name 'ESC STEMI'/>
A 2007 consensus document classifies myocardial infarction into five main types:<ref name=Thygesen2007>{{cite journal |author=Thygesen K, Alpert JS, White HD |title=Universal definition of myocardial infarction |journal=Eur. Heart J. |volume=28 |issue=20 |pages=2525–38 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17951287 |doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehm355 |url=http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/20/2525.full}}</ref>
* Type 1 – Spontaneous myocardial infarction related to ischemia due to a primary coronary event such as plaque erosion and/or rupture, fissuring, or dissection
* Type 2 – Myocardial infarction secondary to ischemia due to either increased oxygen demand or decreased supply, e.g. coronary artery spasm, coronary embolism, anaemia, arrhythmias, hypertension, or hypotension
* Type 3 – Sudden unexpected cardiac death, including cardiac arrest, often with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischaemia, accompanied by new ST elevation, or new LBBB, or evidence of fresh thrombus in a coronary artery by angiography and/or at autopsy, but death occurring before blood samples could be obtained, or at a time before the appearance of cardiac biomarkers in the blood
* Type 4 – Associated with [[coronary angioplasty]] or stents:
** Type 4a – Myocardial infarction associated with PCI
** Type 4b – Myocardial infarction associated with stent thrombosis as documented by angiography or at autopsy
* Type 5 – Myocardial infarction associated with [[coronary artery bypass graft|CABG]]

The onset of symptoms in myocardial infarction (MI) is usually gradual, over several minutes, and rarely instantaneous.<ref name=warningsigns>[[National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute]]. [http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/actintime/haws/haws.htm Heart Attack Warning Signs]. Retrieved November 22, 2006.</ref> [[Chest pain]] is the most common symptom of acute myocardial infarction and is often described as a sensation of tightness, pressure, or squeezing. Chest pain due to [[ischemia]] (a lack of blood and hence oxygen supply) of the heart muscle is termed [[angina pectoris]]. Pain radiates most often to the left [[arm]], but may also radiate to the lower [[jaw]], [[neck]], right arm, [[Human back|back]], and [[epigastrium]],<ref name 'ESC STEMI'/><ref name = "pmid=2313224">{{cite journal |author=Berger JP, Buclin T, Haller E, Van Melle G, Yersin B |title=Right arm involvement and pain extension can help to differentiate coronary diseases from chest pain of other origin: a prospective emergency ward study of 278 consecutive patients admitted for chest pain |journal=J.

Shortness of breath ([[dyspnea]]) occurs when the damage to the heart limits the [[Cardiac output|output]] of the [[left ventricle]], causing [[left ventricular failure]] and consequent [[pulmonary edema]].  Other symptoms include [[diaphoresis]] (an excessive form of [[sweating]]),<ref name="Mallinson 2010 15"/> weakness, [[light-headedness]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[palpitation]]s.

==Causes==
[[File:Heart attack animation.ogv|thumb|The animation shows how plaque buildup or a coronary artery spasm can lead to a heart attack and how blocked blood flow in a coronary artery can lead to a heart attack.]]
Heart attack rates are higher in association with intense exertion, be it [[stress (biology)|psychological stress]] or [[Human body|physical]] exertion, especially if the exertion is more intense than the individual usually performs.{{fact | date=December 2012}} The period of intense exercise and subsequent recovery is associated with about a 6-fold higher myocardial infarction rate (compared with other more relaxed time frames) for people who are physically very fit.{{fact | date=December 2012}} For those in poor physical condition, the rate differential is over 35-fold higher.{{fact | date=December 2012}} One observed mechanism for this phenomenon is increased [[pulse pressure]], which increases stretching of the arterial walls.{{fact | date=December 2012}}  This stretching results in significant shear stress on [[atheroma]]s, which results in debris breaking loose from these deposits.{{fact | date=December 2012}} This debris floats through the blood vessels, eventually clogging the major coronary arteries.{{fact | date=December 2012}}

Acute severe infection, such as [[pneumonia]], can trigger myocardial infarction.

==Pathophysiology==
{{See also|Acute coronary syndrome}}

[[File:Heart attack diagram.png|right|thumb|A myocardial infarction occurs when an [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] [[Atheroma|plaque]] slowly builds up in the inner lining of a [[coronary artery]] and then suddenly ruptures, causing catastrophic [[thrombus]] formation, totally occluding the artery and preventing blood flow downstream.]]
[[File:Heart ant wall infarction.jpg|thumb|Drawing of the heart showing anterior left ventricle wall infarction]]

Acute myocardial infarction refers to two subtypes of [[acute coronary syndrome]], namely non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction and ST-elevated myocardial infarction, which are most frequently (but not always) a manifestation of [[coronary artery disease]].<ref name="pmid20372757"/> The most common triggering event is the disruption of an [[Atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] [[Atheroma|plaque]] in an epicardial coronary artery, which leads to a clotting cascade, sometimes resulting in total occlusion of the artery.<ref name="pmid20387549">{{cite journal | author = Tsujita K, Kaikita K, Soejima H, Sugiyama S, Ogawa H | title = [Acute coronary syndrome-initiating factors] | language = Japanese | journal = Nippon Rinsho | volume = 68 | issue = 4 | pages = 607–14 | year = 2010 | month = April | pmid = 20387549 }}</ref><ref name="pmid20387546">{{cite journal | author = Dohi T, Daida H | title = [Change of concept and pathophysiology in acute coronary syndrome] | language = Japanese | journal = Nippon Rinsho | volume = 68 | issue = 4 | pages = 592–6 | year = 2010 | month = April | pmid = 20387546 }}</ref> Atherosclerosis is the gradual buildup of [[cholesterol]] and fibrous tissue in plaques in the wall of [[artery|arteries]] (in this case, the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]]), typically over decades.<ref name="pmid20065951">{{cite journal | author = Woollard KJ, Geissmann F | title = Monocytes in atherosclerosis: subsets and functions | journal = Nat Rev Cardiol | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 77–86 | year = 2010 | month = February | pmid = 20065951 | pmc = 2813241 | doi = 10.1038/nrcardio.2009.228 }}</ref> Blood stream column irregularities visible on angiography reflect artery [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] narrowing as a result of decades of advancing atherosclerosis.<ref name="pmid18559321">{{cite journal | author = Spaan J, Kolyva C, van den Wijngaard J, ''et al.'' | title = Coronary structure and perfusion in health and disease | journal = Philos Transact a Math Phys Eng Sci | volume = 366 | issue = 1878 | pages = 3137–53 | year = 2008 | month = September | pmid = 18559321 | doi = 10.1098/rsta.2008.0075 | url = http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18559321 }}</ref> Plaques can become unstable, rupture, and additionally promote a [[thrombus]] (blood clot) that occludes the artery; this can occur in minutes. When a severe enough plaque rupture occurs in the coronary vasculature, it leads to myocardial infarction (necrosis of downstream myocardium).<ref name="pmid20387549" /><ref name="pmid20387546" />

If impaired blood flow to the heart lasts long enough, it triggers a process called the [[ischemic cascade]]; the heart cells in the territory of the occluded coronary artery die (chiefly through  [[necrosis]]) and do not grow back. A [[collagen]] [[scar]] forms in its place. Recent studies indicate that another form of cell death called [[apoptosis]] also plays a role in the process of tissue damage subsequent to myocardial infarction.<ref name="Krijnen-2002">{{cite journal | author=Krijnen PA, Nijmeijer R, Meijer CJ, Visser CA, Hack CE, Niessen HW. | title=Apoptosis in myocardial ischaemia and infarction | journal=J Clin Pathol | year=2002 | volume=55 | issue=11 | pages=801–11 | pmid=12401816 | doi = 10.1136/jcp.55.11.801 | pmc=1769793}}</ref>  As a result, the patient's heart will be permanently damaged. This [[myocardial scarring]] also puts the patient at risk for potentially life threatening arrhythmias, and may result in the formation of a [[ventricular aneurysm]] that can rupture with catastrophic consequences.

Injured heart tissue conducts electrical impulses more slowly than normal heart tissue. The difference in conduction velocity between injured and uninjured tissue can trigger [[Cardiac arrhythmia#Re-entry|re-entry]] or a feedback loop that is believed to be the cause of many lethal arrhythmias. The most serious of these arrhythmias is [[ventricular fibrillation]] (''V-Fib''/VF), an extremely fast and chaotic heart rhythm that is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death. Another life-threatening arrhythmia is [[ventricular tachycardia]] (''V-Tach''/VT), which may or may not cause sudden cardiac death. However, ventricular tachycardia usually results in rapid heart rates that prevent the heart from pumping blood effectively. [[Cardiac output]] and [[blood pressure]] may fall to dangerous levels, which can lead to further coronary ischemia and extension of the infarct.

The [[defibrillator|cardiac defibrillator]] is a device that was specifically designed to terminate these potentially fatal arrhythmias. The device works by delivering an electrical shock to the patient in order to depolarize a critical mass of the heart muscle, in effect "[[Booting|rebooting]]" the heart. This therapy is time dependent, and the odds of successful defibrillation decline rapidly after the onset of cardiopulmonary arrest.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis post myocardial infarction varies greatly, depending on a person's health, the extent of the heart damage and the treatment given.

===Complications===
{{Main|Myocardial infarction complications}}
Complications may occur immediately following the heart attack (in the [[Acute (medical)|acute]] phase), or may need time to develop (a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] problem). Acute complications may include heart failure if the damaged heart is no longer able to adequately pump blood around the body; aneurysm or rupture of the myocardium; mitral regurgitation, in particular if the infarction causes dysfunction of the papillary muscle; and arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and heart block. Longer-term complications include heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and the increased risk of a second myocardial infarction.

==Epidemiology==
Myocardial infarction is a common presentation of [[ischemic heart disease]]/[[coronary artery disease]]. The [[World Health Organization]] estimated in 2004, that 12.2% of worldwide deaths were from ischemic heart disease;<ref name="WHO-2004" /> with it being the leading cause of death in high or middle income countries and second only to [[Lower respiratory tract infection|lower respiratory infections]] in [[developed country|lower income countries]].<ref name="WHO-2004" />  Worldwide more than 3 million people have STEMIs and 4 million have NSTEMIs a year.<ref name="Lancet08">{{cite journal |author=White HD, Chew DP |title=Acute myocardial infarction |journal=Lancet |volume=372 |issue=9638 |pages=570–84 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18707987 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61237-4 }}</ref>

Rates of death from [[ischemic heart disease]] have slowed or declined in most [[developed country|high income countries]], although cardiovascular disease still accounted for 1 in 3 of all deaths in the USA in 2008.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Roger VL, Go AS, Lloyd-Jones DM, ''et al.'' |title=Executive summary: heart disease and stroke statistics--2012 update: a report from the American Heart Association |journal=Circulation |volume=125 |issue=1 |pages=188–97 |year=2012 |month=January |pmid=22215894 |doi=10.1161/CIR.0b013e3182456d46 }}</ref> In contrast, ischemic heart disease is becoming a more common cause of death in the developing world. For example in [[India]], ischemic heart disease had become the leading cause of death by 2004 accounting for 1.46 million deaths (14% of total deaths) and deaths due to ischemic heart disease were expected to double during 1985–2015.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gupta R, Joshi P, Mohan V, Reddy KS, Yusuf S |title=Epidemiology and causation of coronary heart disease and stroke in India |journal=Heart |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=16–26 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18083949 |doi=10.1136/hrt.2007.132951 }}</ref> Globally it is predicted that [[disability adjusted life year]]s (DALYs) lost to ischemic heart disease will account for 5.5% of total DALYs in 2030, making it the second most important cause of disability (after [[Major depressive disorder|unipolar depressive disorder]]), as well as the leading cause of death by this date.<ref name="WHO-2004"/>

==Legal implications==
At [[common law]], in general a myocardial infarction is a [[disease]], but may sometimes be an [[injury]]. This can create coverage issues in administration of no-fault insurance schemes such as [[workers' compensation]]. In general, a heart attack is not covered;<ref name=prairieview>[http://www.pvamu.edu/pages/2026.asp Workers' Compensation FAQ]. [[Prairie View A&M University]]. Retrieved November 22, 2006.</ref> however, it may be a [[Industrial injury|work-related injury]] if it results, for example, from unusual emotional stress or unusual exertion.<ref name=biia>[http://www.biia.wa.gov/significantdecisions/contents.htm SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS Subject Index]. Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals. Retrieved November 22, 2006.</ref>  In addition, in some jurisdictions, heart attacks suffered by persons in particular occupations such as [[police officer]]s may be classified as line-of-duty injuries by statute or policy. In some countries or states, a person having suffered from a myocardial infarction may be prevented from participating in activity that puts other people's lives at risk, for example driving a car or flying an airplane.<ref name="NovaScotia-DrivingRegulations">{{cite web | title=Classification of Drivers' Licenses Regulations | publisher=Nova Scotia Registry of Regulations | date=May 24, 2000 | url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/just/regulations/regs/mvclasdl.htm | accessdate=April 22, 2007}}</ref>

==Research==
Patients who receive [[Stem cell treatments|stem cell treatment]] by [[coronary artery]] injections of [[Adult stem cell|stem cells]] derived from their own [[bone marrow]] after a myocardial infarction (MI) show improvements in left ventricular [[ejection fraction]] and [[end-diastolic volume]] not seen with [[placebo]].

[[Clinical trial]]s of [[progenitor cell]] infusion as a treatment approach to ST elevation MI are proceeding.<ref name=REPAIR2006>{{cite journal | author = Schachinger V, Erbs S, Elsasser A, Haberbosch W, Hambrecht R, Holschermann H, Yu J, Corti R, Mathey DG, Hamm CW, Suselbeck T, Assmus B, Tonn T, Dimmeler S, Zeiher AM; REPAIR-AMI Investigators | title = Intracoronary bone marrow-derived progenitor cells in acute myocardial infarction | year = 2006 | journal = N Engl J Med 2006 | volume = 355 | issue = 12 | pages = 1210–21 | pmid = 16990384 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa060186}}</ref>

There are currently three [[biomaterial]] and [[tissue engineering]] approaches for the treatment of post-MI conditions, but these are in an even earlier stage of [[medical research]]. Many questions and issues must be addressed before they can be applied to patients. The first involves [[polymer]]ic left ventricular restraints in the prevention of [[heart failure]]. The second utilizes ''[[in vitro]]'' engineered cardiac tissue, which is subsequently implanted ''[[in vivo]]''. The final approach entails injecting cells and/or a scaffold into the myocardium to create ''[[in situ]]'' engineered cardiac tissue.<ref name=biomaterials2006>{{cite journal |author=Christman KL, Lee RJ |title=Biomaterials for the treatment of myocardial infarction |journal=J.
