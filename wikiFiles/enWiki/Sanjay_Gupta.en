Gupta was named one of the sexiest men of 2003 by ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine.<ref name="national bestseller"/>

In December 2006, CBS News president [[Sean McManus (television executive)|Sean McManus]] negotiated a deal with CNN that would have Gupta file up to ten reports a year for the ''[[CBS Evening News with Katie Couric]]'' and ''[[60 Minutes]]'' while remaining CNN's chief medical correspondent and associate chief of neurosurgery at Grady Memorial Hospital.

On October 14, 2007, Gupta guest-hosted a health episode of ''[[CBS News Sunday Morning]]'' as its regular host [[Charles Osgood]] was on vacation. In February 2009, Gupta hosted ''AC360'' covering the White House Health Summit. He also guest hosted ''Larry King Live'' in October 2009.

=== Surgeon General candidate ===

On January 6, 2009, CNN announced that Gupta had been considered for the position of [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] by President [[Barack Obama]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Sources: CNN's Gupta Approached for Surgeon General | curly = y | url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/06/gupta.surgeon.general/index.html | publisher=CNN | date = January 6, 2008 | accessdate =January 8, 2009| quote = The Obama transition team approached Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, about becoming U.S. surgeon general, according to sources inside the transition and at CNN.}}</ref>

Some doctors said that his communication skills and high profile would allow him to highlight medical issues and prioritize medical reform. However, others raised concerns about potential [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] with drug companies who have sponsored his broadcasts and his lack of skepticism in weighing the costs and benefits of medical treatments.<ref>{{cite news | first = Lauran | last = Neergaard | title = CNN: Gupta Approached about Surgeon General Post | curly = y dead link| url = http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090107/ap_on_go_ot/surgeon_general | agency=Associated Press |publisher= [[Yahoo!

Representative [[John Conyers]], Jr. (D-MI), wrote a letter opposing Gupta's nomination. Conyers supports a [[single-payer health care]] system, the sort that Conyers' filmmaker friend [[Michael Moore]] advocated in his documentary ''[[Sicko]]''; Gupta has criticized Moore and the film.<ref>{{dead link|date=May 2011|reason=link is to dynamic page}} Hooper, Molly K. (January 8, 2009). [http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/conyerss-opposition-to-gupta-is-connected-to-michael-moore-2009-01-08.html "Conyers's Opposition to Gupta Is Connected to Michael Moore"]. ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]''.</ref><!-- According to Nobel prize winning economist [[Paul Krugman]], "Gupta specifically claimed that Moore 'fudged his facts', when the truth was that on every one of the allegedly fudged facts, Moore was actually right and CNN was wrong". Krugman states that he does not have a problem with Gupta's qualifications, he instead has a problem with Gupta's behavior and claims. Krugman states: "Many commenters don't seem to get the point. Gupta didn't say 'Michael Moore is an annoying blowhard'; he didn't say 'We question his interpretation of the evidence'; he said he 'fudged the facts'. In other words, he accused Moore of lying. That's a very strong accusation, which had better be backed by solid evidence. Instead, we had CNN misreading a number from Moore; CNN objecting to Moore using a projected health care spending number for 2007 instead of an actual number for 2005 (and the projection was right, by the way); CNN accusing Moore of not showing a number that was in fact right there in the movie. And Gupta did not apologize, except for the misread number."<ref>[[Paul Krugman|Krugman, Paul]].

Others, such as [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] commentator [[Jane Hamsher]], defended the appointment,<!-- addressing Krugman's criticisms and--> noting that Gupta's responsibilities as a surgeon general would be not that different from those of his [[CNN]] position, and that Gupta's media presence would make him ideal for the position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/blogs/peek/118484/in_defense_of_the_sanjay_gupta_appointment/|title=In Defense of the Sanjay Gupta Appointment| author=Hamsher, Jane |date= January 9, 2009|publisher=www.alternet.org|accessdate=February 1, 2009}}</ref> From the medical community, Donna Wright, of Creative Health Care Management, a regular commentator on medicine and politics, also defended the appointment on the grounds of his media presence, combined with his medical qualifications, which she viewed as an ideal combination for the post of surgeon general.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bradenton.com/living/story/1148201.html|title=Gupta Good Choice for Surgeon General| author=Wright, Donna |date= January 13, 2009| work=[[The Bradenton Herald]] |accessdate=February 1, 2009}}</ref> Likewise, [[Fred Sanfilippo]], executive vice president for health affairs at [[Emory University]], supported Gupta's nomination by issuing a press release saying: "He has the character, training, intelligence and communications skills needed to help the United States improve its health and health care delivery systems in the next Administration."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emorywheel.com/detail.php?n=26387|title=Gupta Named Top U.S. Doctor| author=White, Christina|date= January 19, 2009| work=[[The Emory Wheel]] |accessdate=February 1, 2009}}</ref> The [[American Council on Exercise]], listed by [[PR Newswire]] as "America's leading authority on fitness and one of the largest fitness certification, education and training organizations in the world", endorsed the nomination of Gupta

== Controversy ==
{{criticism section|date=January 2013}}

=== Criticism of reporting ===

Some journalists and journalism professors specializing in health care have criticized Gupta's coverage. Trudy Lieberman, a regular ''[[The Nation|Nation]]'' contributor on healthcare and director of the health and medicine reporting program at the {{abbr|CUNY|City University of New York}} Graduate School of Journalism,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/directory/bios/trudy_lieberman |title=Trudy Lieberman's biography page | work=[[The Nation]] |accessdate =January 11, 2009}}</ref> reviewed Gupta's "ineptitude" in reporting on the McCain health plan. Lieberman criticized Gupta for relying on insurance industry statistics, and a health expert quoted by Lieberman said that Gupta's reporting “gives a gross oversimplification".<ref>Lieberman, Trudy (October 27, 2008). [http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/ kjh paging_dr_gupta.php?page=all "Campaign Desk, Paging Dr. Gupta, How CNN's Doc Misdiagnosed McCain's Health Plan"], ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]''.</ref>

Peter Aldhous criticized Gupta's "enthusiasm for many forms of medical screening – even when the scientific evidence indicates that it may not benefit patients". He and other medical journalists accuse him of a "pro-screening bias" in promoting widespread [[electrocardiogram]] and prostate cancer screening, even though medical authorities like the US Preventive Services Task Force recommend against it.<ref>Aldhous, Peter (January 8, 2009). [http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/01/should-a-tv-news-doctor-be-us.html "Should a TV News Doctor be US Surgeon General?"] Blog of ''[[New Scientist]]''.</ref>

Others have criticized Gupta's promotion of Merck's cervical cancer vaccine [[Gardasil]], without disclosing the financial arrangements between CNN and Merck.<ref>Martens, Pam (July 20, 2007). [http://www.counterpunch.org/martens07202007.html "CNN's Sanjay Gupta, Laura Bush and the Marketing of Merck's Gardasil: Doctoring the News"], ''[[CounterPunch]]''.</ref>

Gary Schwitzer, professor of health journalism at the University of Minnesota School of Journalism, has also criticized Gupta's reporting.<ref>[http://blog.lib.umn.edu/schwitz/healthnews/075532.html CNN's one-sided view of mammography controversy], Schwitzer health news blog, April 8, 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.googlesyndicatedsearch.com/u/umn?q=Sanjay+Gupta "Sanjay Gupta"], at Schwitzer health news blog.</ref>

=== Michael Moore dispute ===

A July 9, 2007, broadcast of CNN's ''[[The Situation Room]]'' aired a fact-check segment by Gupta on [[Michael Moore]]'s 2007 film ''[[Sicko]]'' in which Gupta stated that Moore had "fudged facts".<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0707/09/sitroom.03.html "CNN's Dr. Gupta looks at 'Sicko' and Some Facts Are Incorrect"], ''The Situation Room'', CNN. Aired {{j|July 9, 2007 – 19:00 ET}}.</ref>

Immediately following the segment, Moore was interviewed live on CNN by [[Wolf Blitzer]]. Moore said that Gupta's report was inaccurate and biased, and Moore later posted a detailed response on his website.<ref>{{cite web| title = 'SiCKO' Truth Squad Sets CNN Straight| publisher=[[Michael Moore]]| date = July 10, 2007| url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/sicko/news/article_10017.php| accessdate =July 17, 2007 }}</ref> Moore accused CNN of being biased in favor of the drug industry because most of the sponsors for their medical coverage were drug companies.

On July 10, 2007, Gupta debated Moore on ''[[Larry King Live]]''; on July 15, CNN released a statement in response to Michael Moore's rebuttal.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/2007-07-15/entertainment/moore.gupta_1_sicko-michael-moore-cnn-programs?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ | publisher=CNN | title=Michael Moore, Dr. Gupta Square Off over 'Sicko' | date=July 10, 2007}}</ref> In it, they apologized for an error in their on-air report, having stated that in the film Moore reported Cuba spends $25 per person for health care when the film actually gave that number as $251. CNN attributed this to a transcription error. CNN defended the rest of Gupta's report and issued a point-by-point response to Moore's response in which CNN contended that Moore's comparison of data from different sources in different years was in effect [[confirmation bias|"cherry picking"]] results, at the cost of statistical accuracy.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}
