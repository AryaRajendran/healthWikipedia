=== Naming ===
{{Main|Alternative names for chronic fatigue syndrome}}

Chronic fatigue syndrome is the most commonly used designation,<ref name="pmid 10583715"/> but widespread approval of a name is lacking.<ref name="PMID_11809249"/> Different authorities on the illness view CFS as a central nervous system, metabolic, infectious or post-infectious, cardiovascular, immune system or psychiatric disorder, and different symptom profiles may be caused by various disorders.<ref name="pmid 15929497" />

Over time and in different countries many names have been associated with the condition(s). Aside from CFS, some other names used include Akureyri disease, benign myalgic encephalomyelitis, chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome, chronic infectious mononucleosis, epidemic myalgic encephalomyelitis, epidemic neuromyasthenia, Iceland disease, myalgic encephalomyelitis, myalgic encephalitis, myalgic encephalopathy, [[post-viral fatigue syndrome]], raphe nucleus encephalopathy, [[Royal Free Hospital|Royal Free]] disease, [[Tapanui]] flu, and yuppie flu (the last considered pejorative).<ref name = NORD>{{cite web |author= NORD |title= Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis |publisher= National Organization for Rare Disorders, Inc. |date= June 23, 2008 |url= http://www.rarediseases.org/search/rdbdetail_abstract.html?disname=Chronic%20Fatigue%20Syndrome/Myalgic%20Encephalomyelitis |accessdate= 2008-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |isbn= 0-393-03408-9 |last= Donoghue |first= PJ |coauthors= Siegel ME |url= http://books.google.com/?id=8r1dnOxPwdEC&pg=PA15 |accessdate= 2008-09-17 |title= Sick And Tired Of Feeling Sick And Tired: Living with Invisible Chronic Illness |publisher= [[W.

The most commonly used [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic criteria]] and definition of CFS for research and clinical purposes were published by the United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC).<ref name="pmid:12562565"/> The CDC recommends the following three criteria be fulfilled:<ref name=CDCdiagnosis>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/cfs/diagnosis/index.html|title=CDC - Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) - Diagnosis| publisher=Cdc.gov |accessdate=2012-07-22}}</ref> 
# A new onset (not lifelong) of severe [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] for six consecutive months or greater duration which is unrelated to exertion, is not substantially relieved by rest, and is not a result of other medical conditions.
# The fatigue causes a significant reduction of previous activity levels.
# Four or more of the following symptoms that last six months or longer:
#* Impaired [[memory]] or concentration
#* Post-exertional [[malaise]], where physical or mental exertions bring on "extreme, prolonged exhaustion and sickness"
#* Unrefreshing sleep
#* Muscle [[pain]] ([[myalgia]])
#* Pain in multiple joints ([[arthralgia]])
#* [[Headache]]s of a new kind or greater severity
#* Sore throat, frequent or recurring
#* Tender [[lymph node]]s (cervical or axillary)

Other common symptoms include:
:* Irritable bowel, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea or bloating
:* Chills and [[night sweats]]
:* [[Brain fog]]
:* Chest pain
:* Shortness of breath
:* Chronic cough
:* Visual disturbances (blurring, sensitivity to light, eye pain or dry eyes)
:* Allergies or sensitivities to foods, alcohol, odors, chemicals, medications or noise
:* Difficulty maintaining upright position (orthostatic instability, irregular heartbeat, dizziness, balance problems or fainting)
:* Psychological problems (depression, irritability, mood swings, anxiety, panic attacks)<ref name="CDCSymptoms" />

=== Cognitive functioning ===
A 2010 meta-analysis concluded cognitive symptoms were principally resultants of decreased attention, memory, and reaction time. The deficits were in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 standard deviations below expected and were judged likely to affect day-to-day activities. Simple and complex information processing speed and functions entailing working memory over long time periods were moderately to extensively impaired. These deficits are generally consistent with those reported by patients. Perceptual abilities, motor speed, language, reasoning, and intelligence did not appear to be significantly altered.<ref name="PMID 20047703">{{cite journal |author=Cockshell SJ, Mathias JL |title=Cognitive functioning in chronic fatigue syndrome: a meta-analysis |journal=Psychol Med |volume= 40|issue= 8|pages=1–15 |year=2010 |month=January |pmid=20047703 |doi=10.1017/S0033291709992054 |url=}}</ref>

A ''[[Cochrane Library|Cochrane Review]]'' meta-analysis of 15 randomized, controlled cognitive behavioral therapy trials with 1043 participants concluded that CBT was an effective treatment to reduce the symptom of fatigue. Four reviewed studies showed that CBT resulted in a clinical response for 40% of participants vs 26% of those treated with "usual care". Similarly, in three studies CBT worked better than other types of psychological therapies (48% vs 27%).

=== Graded exercise therapy ===
[[Graded exercise therapy]] is a form of [[physical therapy]]. A meta-analysis published in 2004 of five randomized trials found that patients who received exercise therapy were less fatigued after 12 weeks than the control participants, and the authors cautiously conclude that GET shows promise as a treatment.

=== Pacing ===
Pacing is an energy management strategy based on the observation that symptoms of the illness tend to increase following minimal exertion. There are two forms: symptom-contingent pacing, where the decision to stop (and rest or change an activity) is determined by an awareness of an exacerbation of symptoms; and time-contingent pacing, which is determined by a set schedule of activities which a patient estimates he or she is able to complete without triggering post-exertional malaise (PEM).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Goudsmit|first=E|coauthors=Nijs, J, Jason, LA and Wallman, KE|title=Pacing as a strategy to improve energy management in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome: a consensus document|journal=Disability and Rehabilitation|date=19|year=2011|month=December|volume=Early Online|pages=1–8|doi=10.3109/09638288.2011.635746|pmid=22181560|url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/full/10.3109/09638288.2011.635746|accessdate=21 January 2012|issue=13}}{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref>{{dead link|date=April 2013}} Thus the principle behind pacing for CFS is to avoid over-exertion and an exacerbation of symptoms. It is not aimed at treating the illness as a whole. Those whose illness appears stable may gradually increase activity and exercise levels but according to the principle of pacing, must rest if it becomes clear that they have exceeded their limits. Some programmes combine symptom and time-contingent approaches. A trial of one such programme reported limited benefits.<ref name="PMID_18382818">{{cite journal |author=Nijs J, Paul L, Wallman K |title=Chronic fatigue syndrome: an approach combining self-management with graded exercise to avoid exacerbations |journal=J Rehabil Med |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=241–7 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18382818 |doi=10.2340/16501977-0185 |url=http://jrm.medicaljournals.se/files/pdf/40/4/937.pdf }}{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref>{{dead link|date=April 2013}} A larger, randomised controlled trial found that pacing had statistically better results than relaxation/flexibility therapy.<ref name="PMID_15115421">{{cite journal |author=Wallman KE, Morton AR, Goodman C, Grove R, Guilfoyle AM |title=Randomised controlled trial of graded exercise in chronic fatigue syndrome |journal=Med.

A 2003 review states that studies have reported between 7 and 3,000 cases of CFS for every 100,000 adults.<ref name="pmid:12562565"/> Ranjith reviewed the epidemiological literature on CFS and suggested that the wide variance of the [[prevalence]] estimates may be due to the different definitions of CFS in use, the settings in which patients were selected, and the methodology used to exclude study participants with possible alternative diagnoses.<ref name="PMID_15699086"/> The [[Centers for Disease Control]] reports that more than 1 million Americans have CFS and approximately 80% of the cases are undiagnosed.<ref name="CDCBasic"/> Approximately 250,000 people in the UK are affected with the illness according to the [[National Health Service]].<ref name="NHS_CFS">{{cite web |title= Chronic fatigue syndrome |publisher= The National Health Service |date= 2009-06-29 |url= http://www.nhs.uk/me/introduction.aspx |accessdate= 2010-05-14}}</ref>

=== Risk factors ===
All ethnic and racial groups appear susceptible to the illness, and lower income groups are slightly more likely to develop CFS.<ref name="CDCRisk"/> A 2009 meta-analysis showed that compared with the White American majority, African Americans and Native Americans have a significantly higher risk of CFS.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Sokratis |last1=Dinos |first2=Bernadette |last2=Khoshaba |first3=Deborah |last3=Ashby |first4=Peter D. |last4=White |first5=James, ''et al.'' |last5=Nazroo |title=A systematic review of chronic fatigue, its syndromes and ethnicity: prevalence, severity, co-morbidity and coping |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=1554–70 |year=2009 |pmid=19349479 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyp147}}</ref> More women than men get CFS &mdash; between 60 and 85% of cases are women; however, there is some indication that the prevalence among men is underreported.

A systematic review in 2008 included eleven primary studies that had assessed various demographic, medical, psychological, social and environmental factors to predict the development of CFS, and found many had reported significant associations to CFS.<ref name="PMID_17892624">{{cite journal |author= Hempel S, Chambers D, Bagnall AM, Forbes C |title= Risk factors for chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis: a systematic scoping review of multiple predictor studies |journal= Psychol Med |volume= 38 |issue= 7 |pages= 915–26 |year= 2008 |month= July |pmid= 17892624 |doi= 10.1017/S0033291707001602}}</ref> The reviewers concluded that the lack of generalizability and replication between studies meant that "none of the identified factors appear suitable for the timely identification of patients at risk of developing CFS/ME within clinical practice."

=== Differential diagnoses ===
Certain medical conditions can cause chronic fatigue and must be ruled out before a diagnosis of CFS can be given. [[Hypothyroidism]], [[anemia]], [[diabetes]] and certain [[psychiatric]] disorders are a few of the diseases that must be ruled out if the patient presents with appropriate symptoms.<ref name="CDC1994"/><ref name=NICECG53/><ref name="pmid_11925084">{{cite journal |author= Craig, T and Kakumanu S |title= Chronic fatigue syndrome: evaluation and treatment |journal= Am Fam Physician. |volume= 65 |issue= 6 |pages= 1083–90 |year= Mar 2002 |url= http://www.aafp.org/afp/20020315/1083.html |pmid= 11925084}}</ref>

People with [[fibromyalgia]] (FM, or fibromyalgia syndrome, FMS), like those with CFS, have muscle pain, severe fatigue and sleep disturbances. The presence of allodynia (abnormal pain responses to mild stimulation) and of extensive tender points in specific locations differentiates FM from CFS, though the two diseases often co-occur.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Bradley LA, McKendree-Smith NL, Alarcon GS |title= Pain complaints in patients with fibromyalgia versus chronic fatigue syndrome |journal= Curr Rev Pain |volume= 4 |issue= 2 |pages= 148–57 |year= 2000 |pmid= 10998728}}</ref> Fatigue and muscle pain occurs frequently in the initial phase of various hereditary muscle disorders and in several autoimmune, endocrine and metabolic syndromes; and are frequently labelled as CFS or fibromyalgia in the absence of obvious biochemical/metabolic abnormalities and neurological symptoms.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} 

A 2006 review found that there was a lack of literature to establish the [[discriminant validity]] of undifferentiated [[somatoform disorder]] from CFS. The author stated that there is a need for proponents of chronic fatigue syndrome to distinguish it from undifferentiated somatoform disorder. The author also mentioned that the experience of fatigue as exclusively physical and not mental is captured by the definition of somatoform disorder but not CFS.<ref>{{cite journal |author= van Staden WC |title= Conceptual issues in undifferentiated somatoform disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome |journal= Curr Opin Psychiatry |volume= 19 |issue= 6 |pages= 613–8 |year= 2006 |pmid= 17012941 |doi= 10.1097/01.yco.0000245753.83502.d9}}</ref> Hysterical diagnoses are not merely diagnoses of exclusion but require criteria to be met on the positive grounds of both primary and secondary gain.<ref>Jenkins R, Mowbray J, ed.

Depressive symptoms, if seen in CFS, may be [[Differential diagnosis|differentially diagnosed]] from primary depression due to the absence of [[anhedonia]], decreased motivation, and guilt; and the presence of somatic symptoms such as sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, and exercise intolerance with postexertional exacerbation of symptoms.<ref name="pmid_11925084"/>

=== Co-morbidity ===
Many CFS patients will also have, or appear to have, other medical problems or related diagnoses. Co-morbid [[fibromyalgia]] is common. Fibromyalgia occurs in a large percentage of CFS patients between onset and the second year, and some researchers suggest fibromyalgia and CFS are related.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Friedberg F, Jason LA |title= Chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia: clinical assessment and treatment |journal= J Clin Psychol. |volume= 57 |issue= 4 |pages= 433–55 |year= 2001 |pmid= 11255201 |doi= 10.1002/jclp.1040}}</ref> As previously mentioned, many CFS sufferers also experience symptoms of [[irritable bowel syndrome]], [[temporomandibular joint]] pain, [[headache]] including [[migraine]]s, and other forms of [[myalgia]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of chronic fatigue syndrome}}
In 1934 an outbreak then referred to as ''atypical poliomyelitis'' (at the time it was considered a form of [[polio]]) occurred at the [[Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center|Los Angeles County Hospital]]. It strongly resembled what is now called chronic fatigue syndrome and affected a large number of nurses and doctors.<ref name="ISBN 0-7890-2196-X_p6-7">{{cite book |author= Patarca-Montero R |title=Medical Etiology, Assessment, and Treatment of Chronic Fatigue and Malaise |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2004|pages=6–7|isbn=0-7890-2196-X }}</ref> In 1955 at the [[Royal Free Hospital]] in London, another outbreak occurred that also affected mostly the hospital staff. Also resembling CFS, it was called both ''Royal Free disease'' and ''benign myalgic encephalomyelitis'' and formed the basis of descriptions by Acheson, Ramsay, and others.<ref name="pmid13637100">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(59)90280-3 |title=The clinical syndrome variously called benign myalgic encephalomyelitis, Iceland disease and epidemic neuromyasthenia |year=1959 |last1=Acheson |first1=E.D. |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=569–95 |pmid=13637100}}</ref> In 1969 benign myalgic encephalomyelitis was first classified into the [[ICD|International Classification of Diseases]] under ''Diseases of the nervous system''.<ref name="ICD_8_ME">{{Cite book |title= International Classification of Diseases |publisher= World Health Organization |year= 1969 |volume= I |pages= 158, (vol 2, pp. 173) }}</ref>

The name ''chronic fatigue syndrome'' was used in the medical literature in 1987<ref name=PMID_3033338>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.257.17.2303 |title=Frequency of 'chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection' in a general medical practice |year=1987 |last1=Buchwald |first1=D. |journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=257 |issue=17 |pages=2303–7 |pmid=3033338}}</ref> to describe a condition resembling "chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection" but which presented no evidence of EBV as its cause. The initial case definition of CFS was published in 1988, "Chronic fatigue syndrome: a working case definition", (the [[Clinical descriptions of chronic fatigue syndrome#Holmes|Holmes definition]]), and displaced the name [[Chronic Epstein-Barr virus|''chronic Epstein-Barr virus syndrome'']].

A 2009 study published in the journal "Science", reported an association between a retrovirus [[xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus]] (XMRV) and CFS. The editors of ''Science'', subsequently attached an "Editorial Expression of Concern" to the report to the effect that the validity of the study "''is now seriously in question"''.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1208542 |title=Editorial Expression of Concern |year=2011 |last1=Alberts |first1=B. |journal=Science |volume=333 |issue=6038 |page=35 |pmid=21628391}}</ref> and in September 2011, the authors published a "Partial Retraction" of their 2009 findings,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1212182 |title=Partial Retraction |year=2011 |last1=Silverman |first1=R.

== Research funding ==

In November 2006, an unofficial inquiry by an ad hoc group of parliamentarians in the United Kingdom, set up and chaired by former MP, Dr Ian Gibson, called the Group on Scientific Research into ME<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erythos.com/gibsonenquiry/Docs/ME_Inquiry_Report.pdf |title=Erythos.com |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-01-28}}</ref> was addressed by a government minister claiming that few good biomedical research proposals have been submitted to the Medical Research Council (MRC) in contrast to those for psychosocial research. They were also told by other scientists of proposals that have been rejected, with claims of bias against support for biomedical research.

The MRC confirmed to the Group that, from April 2003 to November 2006, it has turned down 10 biomedical applications relating to CFS/ME and funded five applications relating to CFS/ME, mostly in the psychiatric/psychosocial domain.

In 2008, the MRC set up an expert group to consider how the MRC might encourage new high-quality research into CFS/ME and partnerships between researchers already working on CFS/ME and those in associated areas. It currently lists CFS/ME with a highlight notice, inviting researchers to develop high quality research proposals for funding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Ourresearch/ResearchInitiatives/CFSME/index.htm |title=Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis |publisher=MRC.ac.uk |accessdate=2011-01-28}}</ref> In February 2010, the All-Party Parliamentary Group on ME (APPG on ME) produced a legacy paper, which welcomed the recent MRC initiative, but felt that there has been far too much emphasis in the past on psychological research with insufficient attention to biomedical research and that it is vital that further biomedical research be undertaken to help discover a cause and more effective forms of management for this disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://appgme.org.uk/Downloads/appg_interim_report_v2.pdf |title=APPGME.org.uk |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-01-28}}</ref>

A major divide exists over whether funding for research and treatment should focus on [[physiological]], [[psychological]] or [[psychosocial]] aspects of CFS. This division is especially great between patient groups and psychological and psychosocial treatment advocates in Great Britain.<ref name="pmid17535450"/> In 2011, it was reported by the [[BBC]] this conflict had involved personal vilification and allegations of professional misconduct to professional societies and universities of researchers who were investigating possible psychiatric connections. One of these researchers, [[Simon Wessely]], reported personal death threats. Virologist Professor Myra McClure was subjected to abuse from patients who accused her of having a vested interest after she published a paper indicating that early studies suggesting a link between CFS and the XMRV virus were flawed.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/aug/21/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-myalgic-encephalomyelitis Chronic fatigue syndrome researchers face death threats from militants] - The Guardian, 21 August 2011</ref> As a result, she decided not to pursue any further research into CFS. Pediatrician Dr Esther Crawley changed her phone number and talked to the police. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/SMC-Anniversary-Brochure.pdf |title=Views from the front line |publisher=Science Media Centre |date=2012 |accessdate=2012-12-07}}</ref> This vilification serves as an incentive to abandon or avoid the area of study entirely, as few would want to undergo a "torrent of abuse." Charles Shepherd from the ME Association condemned the abuse of researchers, but said sufferers had a justifiable complaint that almost no government-funded research was looking at the bio-medical aspects of the illness.<ref name=BBCToday />

=== Blood donation ===
Based on the possible link between CFS and XMRV, in 2010 a variety of [[Blood donation|national blood banks]] adopted measures to discourage or prohibit individuals diagnosed with CFS from donating blood, and decline donations when aware the potential donor had been diagnosed. Organizations adopting these or similar measures included the [[Canadian Blood Services]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2010/04/07/blood-donations-chronic-fatigue-virus.html |title=No blood from chronic fatigue donors: agency |date=2010-04-07 |publisher= [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |accessdate= 2010-06-25 }}</ref> the [[New Zealand Blood Service]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.voxy.co.nz/national/chronic-fatigue-set-disqualify-blood-donors/5/45805 |title= Chronic Fatigue Set To Disqualify Blood Donors |accessdate= 2010-06-25 |date= 2010-04-21 |last= Atkinson |first= K |publisher= Voxy.co.nz }}</ref> the [[Australian Red Cross Blood Service]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.donateblood.com.au/news-events/national-news-events/blood-service-updates-cfs-donor-policy |title=Blood Service updates CFS donor policy |date=2010-04-23 |publisher= [[Australian Red Cross Blood Service]] |accessdate= 2010-09-27 }}{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref>{{dead link|date=April 2013}} and the [[American Association of Blood Banks]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.aabb.org/pressroom/Pages/cfsrecommendation.aspx |title= Recommendation on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Blood Donation |publisher= [[American Association of Blood Banks]] |date= 2010-06-18 |accessdate= 2010-06-25 }}</ref>
In November 2010 the UK National Blood Service introduced a permanent deferral of donation from CFS patients based on the potential harm to those patients that may result from their giving blood.<ref name=NHSBT>{{cite web |author=NHS Blood and Transplant |url=http://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/news/2010/newsrelease071010.html |title=ME/CFS sufferers permanently deferred from giving blood |date=2010-11-05 |accessdate=2011-10-09}}</ref>

===Controversy===
{{Main|Controversies related to chronic fatigue syndrome}}

Chronic fatigue syndrome is an illness with a long history of controversies.
