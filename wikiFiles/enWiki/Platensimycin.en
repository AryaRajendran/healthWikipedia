==History==

Platensimycin was first isolated from a strain of ''Streptomyces platensis'' by the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] group [1] by using two-plate system where control organisms were compared to cells expressing fabF [[antisense RNA]]. This method uses the combination of target-based whole-cell and biochemical [[assay]]s. The advantage of this method is that the concentrations of compounds in these extracts is sometimes too low to be identified in whole cell assays but are easily found in this two-plate assay system. They tried to find a drug targeting condensing enzymes and can be used clinically. Therefore, they systematically screened 250,000 natural product extracts (83,000 [[strains (biology)|strains]] in three growth conditions) led to the identification of a potent and selective small molecule from a strain of Streptomyces platensis recovered from a [[soil sample]] collected in South Africa. This molecule, platensimycin (C24H27NO7, relative [[molecular mass]] 441.47), comprises two distinct structural elements connected by an [[amide bond]]. They still showed that Platensimycin has potent, [[Broad-spectrum antibiotic|broad-spectrum]] Gram-positive activity ''[[in vitro]]'' (Table below) and exhibits no [[cross-resistance]] to other key [[Antibiotic resistance|antibiotic-resistant]] bacteria including [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]](MRSA), [[vancomycin]]-intermediate [[Staphylococcus aureus|S. aureus]], [[Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus|vancomycin-resistant Enterococci]], and [[linezolid]]-resistant and [[macrolide]]-resistant [[pathogen]]s.

A first [[total synthesis]] of [[Racemic mixture|racemic]] platensimycin has been published.[7] Its structure consists of a 3-amino-[[2,4-Dihydroxybenzoic acid|2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid]] [[Chemical polarity|polar]] part linked through an amide bond to a [[lipophilic]] [[Polycyclic compound|pentacyclic]] [[ketolide]].<ref>K. C. Nicolaou, A. Li, D. J. Edmonds,  ''Angew. Chem.'' '''2006''', ''118'', 7244-48.</ref>

==Clinical use==

Platensimycin is an [[Experimental drug|experimental new drug]] in [[Pre-clinical development|preclinical trials]] in an effort to combat MRSA in a [[Animal model|mouse model]].[1] Platensimycin is a very effective antibiotic ''in vivo'' when continuously administered to cells, however this efficacy is reduced when administered by more conventional means.<ref>K B. Herath, A B. Attygalle, and S B. Singh,''JACS'' '''2007''', ''129'', 15422-23.</ref> Consequently, and in light of the elevated levels of the drug necessary for effectiveness, [[clinical trial]]s have been delayed pending the development of variants of similar chemical form which have more favorable properties.<ref>M J. Smanski, R M. Peterson, S R. Rajski, and B. Shen,''Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy.'' '''2009'''</ref>
Since the importance of platensimycin, it has been studied to improve the production by [[gene regulation]]<ref>Y. Chen, M.J. Smanski, B. Shen,''Appl Microbiol Biotechnol'' '''2010''', ''86'', 19-25.</ref> and it is also emphasized recently to investigate the tolerance of modification without affecting activity by chemical modifications,<ref>J. Krauss, V. Knorr, V. Manhardt, S. Scheffels, F. Bracher, ''Arch Pharm (Weinheim)'' '''2008''', ''341'', 386-92.</ref> which can hopefully create the easier synthetic pathway<ref>Y.Y. Yeung, E.J. Corey,  ''Org Lett '' '''2008''', ''10'', 3877-8.</ref><ref>X. Lu, Q. You, ''Curr Med Chem '' '''2010''', ''17'', 1139-55.</ref> or increase the activity of platensimycin.<ref>D T. Manallack, I T. Crosby, Y. Khakham and B. Capuano, ''Current Medicinal Chemistry'' '''2008''', ''15'', 705-10.</ref>

==Biosynthesis==

The biosynthesis of plantensimycin has been studied by Singh Group[6] using [[isotope]] incorporation experiments to show that the benzoic ring is produced from [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] and [[acetate]] via the [[TCA cycle]], while the C-17 [[Tetracycline antibiotics|tetracyclic]] [[enone]] [[acid]] core is produced from the [[Non-mevalonate pathway|non-mevalonate]] [[terpenoid]] pathway, the pathway is shown as below.[6]

Singh Group observed tetracyclic enone isotope labeling pattern is consistent with the biosynthesis of the tetracycle via the non-mevalonate terpenoid pathway proposed by Rohmer et al.<ref>S. Smith, A. Witkowski, and A K. Joshi, ''Prog. Lipid Res.'' '''2003''', ''42'', 289-317.</ref> and Arigoni and co-workers.<ref>S W. White, J. Zheng, Y X M. Zhang, and C O. Rock, ''Annu. Rev. Biochem.'' '''2005''', ''74'', 791-831.</ref> This pathway involves condensation of a [[thiamine]]-activated [[acetyl]] group arising from the [[decarboxylation]] of pyruvate and [[Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate|glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]] followed by a transposition step. Since both pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (also [[glycerol]]) are part of the [[Glycolysis|glycolytic]] pathway, varying levels of incorporations are expected. Thus, the terpenoid building blocks, [[Dimethylallyl pyrophosphate|dimethylallyl diphosphate]] and [[Isopentenyl pyrophosphate|isopentenyl diphosphate]], synthesized by the non-mevalonate pathway utilizing pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, condense to form the diterpenoid [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] [[Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate|geranylgeranyl diphosphate]] that [[Cyclic compound|cyclizes]] to intermediate 3 which is related to (or derived from) ent-kaurene.<ref>W P. Revill, M J. Bibb, A K. Scheu, H J. Kieser, and D A. Hopwood, ''J. Bacteriol,'' '''2001''', ''183'', 3526-30.</ref> [[Organic redox reaction|Oxidative cleavage]] of the [[double bond]] of intermediate would result in the loss of the terminal three carbons producing the C-17 tetracyclic enone acid unit. An N-acyltransferase reaction of tetracyclic enone and [[aminobenzoic acid]] would lead to platensimycin.
Because of the dissimilarity between plantensimycin's mechanism of action and that of conventional antibiotics, it is believed that the capacity for the development of resistance by bacteria may be substantially decreased.<ref>Potent antibiotic to target MRSA.

==Mechanism of action==

Platensimycin has shown good activity against a panel of Gram positive organisms which included various resistant strains. Platensimycin works by inhibiting beta-ketoacyl synthases I/II (FabF/B) which are key enzymes in the production of fatty acids required for bacterial cell membranes. Here is the possible mechanism of action [2]: Firstly, the [[thiol]] group of FabF Cys163 is activated through the [[dipole]] moment of helix N-alpha-3 which lowers the pKa<ref>A C. Price, C O. Rock, S W. White, ''J. Bacteriol,'' '''2003''', ''185'', 4136-43.</ref> of this [[functional group]]. The [[Nucleophile|nucleophilicity]] of the [[cysteine]] is facilitated by an [[oxyanion hole]] formed with the [[Backbone chain|backbone]] [[amides]] of Cys163 and Phe400. Interestingly, the [[crystal structure]] complex with platensimycin employed a C163Q [[mutant]] which gave a 50-fold increase in apparent binding [1]. The Gln163 [[Residue (chemistry)|residue]] lies adjacent to the [[carboxylate]] of platensimycin but makes no specific [[hydrogen bond]]. Given the close proximity of the carboxylate of platensimycin (presumed to be an [[anion]]) to the anionic thiol of Cys163 in the [[wild type]] enzyme may suggest the reason behind the increase in binding of the C163Q mutant. The second set of residues worth considering comprises His303 and His340 which play a role in the decarboxylation mechanism of the [[malonate|malonyl]] [[Functional group|moiety]]. In particular, His303 activates a structured [[water]] to attack the carboxylate of the incoming malonyl-ACP.<ref>Y M. Zhang, J. Hurlbert, S W. White, C O. Rock, ''J. Biol. Chem.'' '''2006''', ''281'', 17390-99.</ref> The crystal structure of FabF also demonstrates that His340 forms a hydrogen bond between the amide [[nitrogen]] of Leu342 and the N-delta- atom of the [[imidazole]] ring meaning that the lone pair must reside on this atom [1,18]. In the platensimycin crystal structure the structured water adjacent to His303 is no longer present which may suggest an alternative electronic state for this residue. A strong possibility exists that His303 would present itself as a cation capable of forming an ionic interaction with the benzoic acid group of platensimycin [1].
