'''Hypoparathyroidism''' is decreased function of the [[parathyroid gland]]s with underproduction of [[parathyroid hormone]]. This can lead to [[hypocalcemia|low levels of calcium in the blood]], often causing cramping and twitching of muscles or [[Tetany (medical sign)|tetany]] (involuntary muscle contraction), and several other symptoms. The condition can be inherited, but it is also encountered after [[thyroidectomy|thyroid]] or [[parathyroidectomy|parathyroid gland surgery]], and it can be caused by [[autoimmunity|immune system-related damage]] as well as a number of rarer causes. The diagnosis is made with [[blood test]]s, and other investigations such as [[genetic testing]] depending on the results. The treatment of hypoparathyroidism is limited by the fact that there is no artificial form of the hormone that can be administered as [[hormone therapy|replacement]]; calcium replacement or [[vitamin D]] can ameliorate the symptoms but can increase the risk of [[kidney stone]]s and [[chronic kidney disease]].<ref name=Bilezikian/>

==Signs and symptoms==
The main symptoms of hypoparathyroidism are the result of the [[hypocalcemia|low blood calcium level]], which interferes with normal [[muscle contraction]] and [[action potential|nerve conduction]]. As a result, people with hypoparathyroidism can experience [[paresthesia]], an unpleasant tingling sensation around the mouth and in the hands and feet, as well as muscle cramps and severe spasms known as "tetany" that affect the hands and feet.<ref name=Shoback>{{cite journal |author=Shoback D |title=Hypoparathyroidism |journal=N.

A number of [[medical emergency|medical emergencies]] can arise in people with low calcium levels. These are [[epileptic seizure|seizures]], [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|severe irregularities in the normal heart beat]], as well as spasm of the [[laryngospasm|upper part of the airways]] or the [[bronchospasm|smaller airways known as the bronchi]] (both potentially causing [[respiratory failure]]).<ref name=Bilezikian/>

==Causes==
Hypoparathyroidism can have a number of causes:<ref name=Bilezikian/>
* Removal of or trauma to the parathyroid glands in [[thyroid]] surgery  ([[thyroidectomy]]) or other neck surgeries is a recognized cause. It is now uncommon, as [[surgery|surgeon]]s generally can spare them during procedures after identifying them. In a small percentage of cases, however, they can become traumatized during surgery and/or their blood supply can be compromised.  When this happens the parathyroids may cease functioning for a while or stop altogether.
* [[Autoimmune disorder|Autoimmune]] invasion and destruction is the most common non-surgical cause. It can occur as part of [[autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome]]s.
* [[Hemochromatosis]] can lead to iron accumulation and consequent dysfunction of a number of endocrine organs, including the parathyroids.
* Absence or dysfunction of the parathyroid glands is one of the components of [[Chromosome 22, microdeletion 22 q11|chromosome 22q11 microdeletion syndrome]] (other names: DiGeorge syndrome, Schprintzen syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome).
* [[Magnesium deficiency (medicine)|Magnesium deficiency]]
* [[DiGeorge syndrome]], a disease in which hypoparathyroidism can occur due to a total absence of the parathyroid glands at birth. Familial hypoparathyroidism occurs with other endocrine diseases, such as adrenal insufficiency, in a syndrome called autoimmune polyglandular failure syndrome type 1 (APS-I).
* A defect in the calcium receptor leads to a rare congenital form of the disease
* Idiopathic (of unknown cause), occasionally familial

==Mechanism==
The parathyroid glands are so named because they are usually located behind the [[thyroid|thyroid gland]] in the neck. They arise during [[human embryogenesis|fetal development]] from structures known as the third and fourth [[Pharyngeal pouch (embryology)|pharyngeal pouch]]. The glands, usually four in number, contain the [[parathyroid chief cell]]s that sense the level of [[calcium in biology|calcium]] in the blood through the [[calcium-sensing receptor]] and secrete parathyroid hormone. [[Magnesium]] is required for PTH secretion. Under normal circumstances, the parathyroids secrete PTH to maintain a calcium level within normal limits, as calcium is required for adequate muscle and nerve function (including the [[autonomic nervous system]]). PTH acts on several organs to increase calcium levels. It increases calcium absorption in the bowel, while in the kidney it prevents calcium excretion and increases phosphate release and in bone it increases calcium through bone resorption.{{citation needed | date=November 2011}}

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is by measurement of [[calcium]], [[serum albumin]] (for correction) and PTH in [[blood test|blood]].

If necessary, measuring [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] (cyclic AMP) in the urine after an intravenous dose of PTH can help in the distinction between hypoparathyroidism and other causes.{{citation needed | date=November 2011}}

Differential diagnoses are:{{citation needed | date=November 2011}}
* [[Pseudohypoparathyroidism]] (normal PTH levels but tissue insensitivity to the hormone, associated with [[mental retardation]] and [[skeleton|skeletal deformities]]) and [[pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism]] (''sic'').
* [[Vitamin D#Deficiency|Vitamin D deficiency]] or hereditary insensitivity to this vitamin (X-linked dominant).
* [[Malabsorption]]
* [[Kidney disease]]
* Medication: [[steroid]]s, [[diuretic]]s, some [[antiepileptic]]s.

Other tests include [[ECG]] for abnormal heart rhythms, and measurement of blood magnesium levels.{{citation needed | date=November 2011}}

==Treatment==
Severe hypocalcemia, a potentially life-threatening condition,  is treated as soon as possible with [[intravenous]] [[calcium]] (e.g. as [[calcium gluconate]]). Generally, a central venous catheter is recommended, as the calcium can irritate [[peripheral vein]]s and cause [[phlebitis]]. In the event of a life-threatening attack of low calcium levels or tetany (prolonged muscle contractions), calcium is administered by intravenous (IV) infusion. Precautions are taken to prevent seizures or larynx spasms. The heart is monitored for abnormal rhythms until the person is stable. When the life-threatening attack has been controlled, treatment continues with medicine taken by mouth as often as four times a day.{{citation needed | date=November 2011}}

Long-term treatment of hypoparathyroidism is with vitamin D analogs and calcium supplementation may be ineffective in some due to potential renal damage.<ref>Winer KK, Yanovski JA, Cutler GB Jr. Synthetic human parathyroid hormone 1-34 vs calcitriol and calcium in the treatment of hypoparathyroidism: Results of a randomized crossover trial.
