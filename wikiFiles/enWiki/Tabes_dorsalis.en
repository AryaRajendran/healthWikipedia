'''Tabes dorsalis''', also known as '''syphilitic myelopathy''', is a slow degeneration (specifically, demyelination) of the sensory neurons that carry information to the brain. The degenerating nerves are in the [[dorsal columns]] (posterior columns) of the [[spinal cord]] (the portion closest to the back of the body). They help maintain a person's sense of position ([[proprioception]]), vibration, and discriminative touch. 

==Cause==
Tabes dorsalis is caused by [[Demyelinating disease|demyelination]] secondary to an untreated [[syphilis]] infection {{citation needed|date=March 2012}}.

==Symptoms==

Symptoms may not appear for some decades after the initial infection and include: [[weakness]], diminished reflexes, [[paresthesia]]s (shooting and burning pains, pricking sensations, and [[formication]]), [[hypoesthesias]] (abnormally diminished cutaneous, especially tactile, sensory modalities), tabetic gait ([[locomotor ataxia]]), progressive degeneration of the joints, [[loss of coordination]], episodes of intense pain and disturbed sensation (including [[glossodynia]]), personality changes, urinary incontinence, [[dementia]], [[deafness]], [[visual impairment]], positive [[Romberg's test]], and impaired response to light ([[Argyll Robertson pupil]]). The skeletal musculature is hypotonic due to destruction of the sensory limb of the spindle reflex. The deep tendon reflexes are also diminished or absent; for example, the "knee jerk" or [[patellar reflex]] may be lacking ([[Westphal's sign]]).  A complication of tabes dorsalis can be transient neuralgic [[paroxysmal]] pain affecting the eyes and the ophthalmic areas, previously called "Pel's crises" after Dutch physician [[P.K. Pel]].  Now more commonly called "tabetic ocular crises," an attack is characterized by sudden, intense ocular pain, lacrimation and photophobia.<ref name="crisis">{{cite web|url=http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/Pe/Pel's%20crisis.html|title=Pel's Crisis|accessdate=December 14, 2009}}</ref> <ref name="Basic Clinical Neuroscience 2nd Edition"> Basic Clinical Neuroscience, Young, Young, and Tolbert.

"Tabes dorsalgia" is a related back pain.

"Tabetic gait" is a characteristic high-stepping [[gait]] of untreated syphilis where the patient's feet slap the ground as they strike the floor due to loss of [[proprioception]].

== Prognosis ==
Left untreated, tabes dorsalis can lead to [[paralysis]], [[dementia]], and [[blindness]]. Existing nerve damage cannot be reversed.

==Epidemiology==
The disease is more frequent in males than in females. Onset is commonly during mid-life. The incidence of tabes dorsalis is rising, in part due to co-associated [[HIV]] infection.

== Treatment ==
[[Penicillin]], administered [[intravenous]]ly, is the treatment of choice. Associated pain can be treated with [[opiate]]s, [[valproate]], or [[carbamazepine]]. Patients may also require [[physical therapy]] to deal with muscle wasting and weakness. Preventive treatment for those who come into sexual contact with an individual with syphilis is important.

==Notable researchers==
[[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], author of the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories, completed his [[doctorate]] on tabes dorsalis in 1885.<ref>http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/418</ref>

==Notable sufferers==
*[[German people|German]] storywriter [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]] appears to have suffered and died from tabes dorsalis.
*The [[French people|French]] novelist [[Alphonse Daudet]] kept a journal of the pain he experienced from this condition which was posthumously published as ''La Doulou'' (1930) and translated into English as ''In the Land of Pain'' (2002) by [[Julian Barnes]].
*Charles Baudelaire contracted syphilis in 1839 and resorted to opium to help alleviate the pain of tabes dorsalis ascending his spine.
