==History==
The organization was launched in 2001 as the BC HealthGuide Program by  [[Ministry of Health (British Columbia)]]. The program provides [[telephone triage]] and health information through integrated telephone, web and print resources. At its launch, it consisted of three main components: the BC HealthGuide Handbook, a [[Medical handbook|medically approved handbook]] delivered to all B.C. households; a [[Toll-free telephone number|toll-free telephone line]], staffed by [[registered nurse]]s 24/7/365 who provide [[Confidentiality|confidential]] health information and [[Triage|triage services]] over the telephone and a website, called BC HealthGuide Online, which provided a knowledge base of health information and provided links to other credible consumer health information sources and websites. 

On November 21, 2008, the [[Executive Council of British Columbia]] launched a newly branded organization, HealthLink BC, along with its 8-1-1 number.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.bc.ca/hls/media_gallery/events/2008/nov/8_1_1_service_makes_accessing_health_advice_easier_2008_11_27_55847_M.html |title=Ministry of Healthy Living and Sport - 8-1-1 SERVICE MAKES ACCESSING HEALTH ADVICE EASIER |publisher=Gov.bc.ca |date=2008-11-21 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}</ref> This brought together all of the organization’s various services under a single brand and telephone number. These services include Nursing, Dietitian, Pharmacist and Navigation Services, "''HealthLinkBC.ca''" and "''HealthLinkBC Files''".

==Scope of service==

HealthLink BC provides health information services to all regions of British Columbia via its website which contains BC-specific health information and a publicly available database of government-funded and [[not-for-profit]] [[health service]]s and resources in British Columbia; its 8-1-1 telephone number; the BC HealthGuide Handbook, a printed handbook that contains information on common health topics, which is available in [[pharmacies]] and by mail; and the HealthLinkBC Files, a series of one-page health information sheets.

===Public services===

Health service representatives provide general health information, health resource referral information, and transfer calls to HealthLink BC’s professionals over the telephone 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Registered nurses are available 24 hours a day to provide general and specific health information and advice including [[palliative care]] support over the telephone. Registered [[dietitian]]s are available Monday to Thursday 8 am – 8 pm and Friday 8 am - 5 pm to assist callers with [[dietary]] and [[nutrition]] questions over the telephone. Licensed [[pharmacists]] are available every day between 5 pm – 9 am to provide confidential information and advice on [[Prescription medication|prescription]] and [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter medication]]s over the telephone. 

The '[[Trans Fat]] Information Line' is a specialized service which provides [[food industry]] workers with education and coaching on [[Food safety|food handling]] practices to restrict trans fat. (This service was developed in response to B.C.’s 2009 legislation restricting the use of trans fats in the province’s food service establishments)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.restricttransfat.ca/bc_trans_fat_regulation.php |title=Restrict Trans Fat &#124; BC Regulation for Food Service Establishments |publisher=Restricttransfat.ca |date=2009-09-30 |accessdate=2010-07-29}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> 

The 'BC HealthGuide Handbook'  is a 400+ page printed [[medical handbook]] available free-of-charge to residents of British Columbia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccl-cca.ca/NR/rdonlyres/EFF50CAA-19E6-42AB-9AF8-023CCE050000/0/JARLNo1Art317OCT07.pdf |title=Changing immigrants’ attitudes towards intentions to use the BC HealthGuide Program: Culturally specific video messaging for health promotion |publisher=Journal of Applied Research on Learning |year=2007 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}</ref> It provides information on common health topics such as how to recognize and cope with common health issues, illness prevention, home treatment and when to see a health professional. The Handbook is available in [[Canadian English|English]], [[Canadian French|French]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. 

The 'HealthLinkBC Files' are a series of health information sheets with B.C.-specific information on common health topics. A number of HealthLinkBC Files have been translated into other languages including: French, Chinese, Punjabi, [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. HealthLink BC also works with the [[Politics of Yukon|Government of the Yukon]] to provide services to residents of the [[Yukon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ykhealthguide.org/ |title=Yukon HealthGuide |publisher=Ykhealthguide.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-29}}</ref> Yukon residents have access to HealthLinkBC.ca and 8-1-1 and have been provided with a Yukon version of the HealthGuide handbook in English and French.

===Professional support services===

'Community Healthcare and Resource Directory' (CHARD); provides a secure web-based directory of [[mental health]] and [[addictions]] resources in B.C. This has been specifically developed for licensed [[General practitioner|general medical practitioners]] and their [[Medical practice|medical office]] assistants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcmj.org/gpsc/gpsc-and-healthlink-bc-pilot-mental-health-and-addiction-resource-directory |title=GPSC and HealthLink BC pilot mental health and addiction resource directory &#124; BC Medical Journal |publisher=Bcmj.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-03}}</ref>

'Call Transfer to 8-1-1’ provides access to 8-1-1 (using automated call transfer), and is offered to other B.C. health service delivery organizations who also use the phone to provide access to their service. Examples include: VCHA Newborn Hotline – after-hours, callers to the Hotline are automatically transferred to 8-1-1;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://find.healthlinkbc.ca/search.aspx?d=SV000412 |title=HealthLink BC : Find Services and Resources |publisher=Find.healthlinkbc.ca |date=2009-01-15 |accessdate=2011-02-03}}</ref> [[BC Ambulance Service]] – when a call to [[9-1-1]] does not warrant the dispatch of an [[ambulance]], callers are automatically transferred to 8-1-1; and, FHA Primary Health Care Office – after-hours, callers are automatically transferred to 8-1-1.

‘Customized 8-1-1’ refers to identified callers or groups that are provided customized services by utilizing 8-1-1 resources.  Examples include: FHA Hospice [[Palliative Care]] – after-hours, clients call 8-1-1 and receive a customized service that supplements their ongoing palliative care program; and, [[Yukon Territory]] – when a caller accesses 8-1-1 from the Yukon, they receive a customized service that reflects the resources and services available to their locale.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hss.gov.yk.ca/811.php |title=Yukon HealthLine - 8-1-1 - Health and Social Services- Government of Yukon |publisher=Hss.gov.yk.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-03}}</ref>
