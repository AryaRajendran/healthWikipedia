'''Trench Foot ''' is a medical condition caused by prolonged exposure of the feet to damp, unsanitary, and cold conditions. It is one of many [[immersion foot syndromes]]. The use of the word ''trench'' in the name of this condition is a reference to [[trench warfare]], mainly associated with [[World War I]].

== Characteristics ==

Affected feet may become numb, affected by erythrosis (turning red) or cyanosis (turning blue) as a result of poor vascular supply, and feet may begin to have a decaying odour due to the possibility of the early stages of [[necrosis]] setting in. As the condition worsens, feet may also begin to swell. Advanced trench foot often involves [[blister]]s and [[open sore]]s, which lead to [[fungus|fungal]] infections; this is sometimes called [[tropical ulcer]] (jungle rot).

If left untreated, trench foot usually results in [[gangrene]], which can cause the need for [[amputation]]. If trench foot is treated properly, complete recovery is normal, though it is marked by severe short-term pain when feeling returns. As with other cold-related injuries, trench foot leaves sufferers more susceptible to it in the future.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}

== Causes ==
Unlike [[frostbite]], trench foot does not require freezing temperatures and can occur in temperatures up to 60° [[Fahrenheit]] (about 16° [[Celsius]]). The condition can occur with as little as thirteen hours' exposure.{{fact|date=April 2010}} The mechanism of tissue damage is not fully understood. Excessive sweating or [[hyperhidrosis]] has long been regarded as a contributory cause.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.annals.org/content/34/5/1163.extract |title=CHRONIC TRENCH FOOT: A STUDY OF 100 CASES |publisher=Annals.org |date=1951-05-01 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref>

== Prevention ==
Trench foot can be prevented by keeping the feet warm and dry. It was also discovered in World War I that a key preventive measure was regular foot inspections by officers. Soldiers would be paired and each made responsible for the feet of the other. If left to their own devices soldiers might unwisely decide to forgot the task of taking off their boots and socks to dry their feet each day, but if it were the responsibility of another this became less likely.<ref> Bullets, Boots and Bandages, presented by Saul David, BBC Four, February 2012, episode 1/3. </ref> Later on in the war, the time the soldiers had to stay in the trenches was decreased to prevent trench foot.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

== History ==
Trench foot was first noted in [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s army in 1812. It was during the [[French invasion of Russia|retreat from Russia]] that it became prevalent, and was first described by French army surgeon [[Dominique Jean Larrey]].<ref name="pmid15617178">{{cite journal |author=Régnier C |title=Etiological argument about the Trench Foot |language=French |journal=Hist Sci Med |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=315–32 |year=2004 |pmid=15617178 |doi=}}</ref>

It was a particular problem for soldiers in [[trench warfare]] (apropos to the name) during the winters of [[World War I]],<ref name="pmid17219792">{{cite journal |author=Atenstaedt RL |title=Trench foot: the medical response in the first World War 1914-18 |journal=Wilderness Environ Med |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=282–9 |year=2006 |pmid=17219792 |doi=10.1580/06-WEME-LH-027R.1}}</ref> [[World War II]], and the [[Vietnam War]].

Trench foot made a reappearance in the British Army during the [[Falklands War]], in 1982.<ref name="Ryan">{{cite news

Some people were even said to have developed trench foot at the 1998 and 2007 [[Glastonbury Festival]]s, 2009 [[Leeds Festival]] and 2012 [[Download Festival]] as a result of the sustained cold, wet, and muddy conditions at the events.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7450410.stm | work=BBC News | title=I got trench foot at Glastonbury | date=June 23, 2008 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref>
