'''Acidosis''' is an increased [[acidity]] in the blood and other body tissue (i.e., an increased [[hydrogen ion]] [[concentration]]).  If not further qualified, it usually refers to acidity of the [[blood plasma]].

Acidosis is said to occur when arterial [[pH]] falls below 7.35 (except in the fetus- see below), while its counterpart ([[alkalosis]]) occurs at a pH over 7.45. [[Arterial blood gas]] analysis and other tests are required to separate the main causes.

The term '''''acidemia''''' describes the state of low blood pH, while ''acidosis'' is used to describe the processes leading to these states. Nevertheless,  the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. The distinction may be relevant where a patient has factors causing both acidosis and alkalosis, wherein the relative severity of both determines whether the result is a high or a low pH.

The rate of cellular metabolic activity affects and, at the same time, is affected by the pH of the body fluids. In mammals, the normal pH of arterial blood lies between 7.35 and 7.50 depending on the species (e.g., healthy human-arterial blood pH varies between 7.35 and 7.45). Blood pH values compatible with life in mammals are limited to a pH range between 6.8 and 7.8. Changes in the pH of arterial blood (and therefore the extracellular fluid) outside this range result in irreversible cell damage.<ref>Needham, A. 2004. Comparative and Environmental Physiology.

==Metabolic acidosis==
[[Metabolic acidosis]] may result from increased production of metabolic acids or disturbances in the ability to excrete acid via the [[kidney]]s. Renal acidosis is associated with an accumulation of [[urea]] and [[creatinine]] as well as metabolic acid residues of protein catabolism.

An increase in the production of other acids may also produce metabolic acidosis.  For example, [[lactic acidosis]] may occur from:
#severe (PaO<sub>2</sub> <36mm Hg) [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxemia]] causing a fall in the rate of oxygen diffusion from arterial blood to tissues
#[[hypoperfusion]] (e.g., hypovolemic shock) causing an inadequate blood delivery of oxygen to tissues.

A rise in lactate out of proportion to the level of pyruvate, e.g., in mixed venous blood, is termed "excess lactate", and may also be an indicator of fermentation due to anaerobic metabolism occurring in muscle cells, as seen during strenuous exercise. Once oxygenation is restored, the acidosis clears quickly.  Another example of increased production of acids occurs in starvation and diabetic acidosis.  It is due to the accumulation of ketoacids ([[ketosis]]) and reflects a severe shift from glycolysis to [[lipolysis]] for energy needs.

Acid consumption from [[poison]]ing such as [[hypercapnia]], elevated levels of [[iron]] in the blood, and chronically decreased production of [[bicarbonate]] may also produce metabolic acidosis.

Metabolic acidosis is compensated for in the lungs, as increased exhalation of carbon dioxide promptly shifts the buffering equation to reduce metabolic acid. This is a result of stimulation to [[chemosensor|chemoreceptors]], which increases [[alveolar ventilation]], leading to respiratory compensation, otherwise known as [[Kussmaul breathing]] (a specific type of [[hyperventilation]]). Should this situation persist, the patient is at risk for exhaustion leading to [[respiratory failure]].

Mutations to the [[V-ATPase]] 'a4' or 'B1' isoforms result in distal renal tubular acidosis, a condition that leads to metabolic acidosis, in some cases with sensorineural deafness.

[[Arterial blood gas]]es will indicate low [[pH]], low blood [[HCO3|HCO<sub>3</sub>]], and normal or low PaCO<sub>2</sub>.
In addition to arterial blood gas, an [[anion gap]] can also differentiate between possible causes.

The [[Henderson-Hasselbalch equation]] is useful for calculating blood pH, because blood is a [[buffer solution]]. The amount of metabolic acid accumulating can also be quantitated by using buffer base deviation, a derivative estimate of the metabolic as opposed to the respiratory component. In hypovolemic shock for example, approximately 50% of the metabolic acid accumulation is [[lactic acid]], which disappears as blood flow and oxygen debt are corrected.

Treatment of uncompensated metabolic acidosis is focused upon correcting the underlying problem. When metabolic acidosis is severe and can no longer be compensated for adequately by the lungs, neutralizing the acidosis with infusions of [[bicarbonate]] may be required.

===Fetal metabolic acidemia===
In the [[fetus]], the normal range differs based on which [[umbilical vessel]] is sampled ([[umbilical vein]] pH is normally 7.25 to 7.45; [[umbilical artery]] pH is normally 7.18 to 7.38).<ref name="Yeomans">{{cite journal|last=Yeomans|first=ER|coauthors=Hauth, JC; Gilstrap, LC III; Strickland DM|title=Umbilical cord pH, PCO2, and bicarbonate following uncomplicated term vaginal deliveries (146 infants)|journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol|year=1985|volume=151|pages=798â€“800|pmid=3919587}}</ref>  [[Fetal metabolic acidemia]] is defined as an umbilical vessel pH of less than 7.20 and a [[base excess]] of less than -8.<ref name="Pomerance">{{cite book|last=Pomerance|first=Jeffrey|title=Interpreting Umbilical Cord Gases: For Clinicians Caring for the Fetus or Newborn|year=2004|publisher=BNMG|isbn=978-0-9752621-0-8|location=Pasadena, CA}}</ref>

==Respiratory acidosis==
[[Respiratory acidosis]] results from a build-up of carbon dioxide in the blood (hypercapnia) due to [[hypoventilation]]. It is most often caused by [[lung|pulmonary]] problems, although [[head injury|head injuries]], drugs (especially [[anaesthetic]]s and [[sedative]]s), and [[brain tumor]]s can cause this acidemia. [[Pneumothorax]], [[emphysema]], chronic [[bronchitis]], [[asthma]], severe [[pneumonia]], and [[aspiration pneumonia|aspiration]] are among the most frequent causes. It can also occur as a compensatory response to chronic [[metabolic alkalosis]].

One key to distinguish between respiratory and metabolic acidosis is that in respiratory acidosis, the CO<sub>2</sub> is increased while the [[bicarbonate]] is either normal (uncompensated) or increased (compensated). Compensation occurs if respiratory acidosis is present, and a chronic phase is entered with partial buffering of the acidosis through renal bicarbonate retention.

However, in cases where chronic illnesses that compromise pulmonary function persist, such as late-stage emphysema and certain types of [[muscular dystrophy]], compensatory mechanisms will be unable to reverse this acidotic condition. As metabolic bicarbonate production becomes exhausted, and extraneous bicarbonate infusion can no longer reverse the extreme buildup of carbon dioxide associated with uncompensated respiratory acidosis, [[mechanical ventilation]] will usually be applied.<ref name="urlMedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Respiratory acidosis">{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000092.htm |title=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Respiratory acidosis |work= |accessdate=2008-12-06| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081211063809/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000092.htm| archivedate= 11 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="urleMedicine - Respiratory Acidosis : Article by Jackie A Hayes">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic2008.htm |title=eMedicine - Respiratory Acidosis : Article by Jackie A Hayes |work= |accessdate=2008-12-06| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081211000658/http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2008.htm| archivedate= 11 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Fetal respiratory acidemia===
In the [[fetus]], the normal range differs based on which [[umbilical vessel]] is sampled ([[umbilical vein]] pH is normally 7.25 to 7.45; [[umbilical artery]] pH is normally 7.20 to 7.38).<ref name="Yeomans" />  In the fetus, the lungs are not used for ventilation.  Instead, the [[placenta]] performs ventilatory functions ([[gas exchange]]).  [[Fetal respiratory acidemia]] is defined as an umbilical vessel pH of less than 7.20 and an umbilical artery PCO<sub>2</sub>of 66 or higher or umbilical vein PCO<sub>2</sub> of 50 or higher.<ref name="Pomerance">{{cite book|last=Pomerance|first=Jeffrey|title=Interpreting Umbilical Cord Gases: For Clinicians Caring for the Fetus or Newborn|year=2004|publisher=BNMG|isbn=978-0-9752621-0-8|location=Pasadena, CA}}</ref>
