'''Pericardial effusion''' ("fluid around the heart") is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the [[pericardial cavity]]. Because of the limited amount of space in the pericardial cavity, [[fluid]] accumulation leads to an increased intrapericardial pressure which can negatively affect [[heart]] function.  A pericardial effusion with enough pressure to adversely affect heart function is called [[cardiac tamponade]]. Pericardial effusion usually results from a disturbed equilibrium between the production and re-absorption of [[pericardial fluid]], or from a structural abnormality that allows fluid to enter the pericardial cavity. 

Normal levels of pericardial fluid are from 15 to 50 mL.

== Types ==
It may be: 
* ''transudative'' ([[congestive heart failure]], [[myxoedema]], [[nephrotic syndrome]]),
* ''exudative'' ([[tuberculosis]], spread from [[empyema]]) 
* ''haemorrhagic'' (trauma, rupture of aneurysms, malignant effusion).
* ''malignant'' (due to fluid accumulation caused by [[metastasis]])

== Signs and symptoms ==
Chest pain or pressure are common symptoms. A small effusion may be asymptomatic.  Larger effusions may cause [[cardiac tamponade]], a life-threatening complication; signs of impending tamponade include [[dyspnea]], low [[blood pressure]], and distant [[heart sounds]].

The so-called "water-bottle heart" is a radiographic sign of pericardial effusion, in which the cardiopericardial silhouette is enlarged and assumes the shape of a flask or water bottle.

It can be associated with dullness to percussion over the left subscapular area due to compression of the left lung base. This phenomenon is known as [[Ewart's sign]].<ref name="urlPericardial Disease">{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/medicalpubs/diseasemanagement/cardiology/pericardial/pericardial.htm |title=Pericardial Disease |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

== Causes ==

* [[Pericarditis]]
* Long term usage of cabergoline ingredient ([[dopamine agonists]])
* [[virus|Viral]] infection ([[coxsackie]] virus)
* [[Infection]]
* Inflammatory disorders, such as [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]] and post [[myocardial infarction]] [[pericarditis]] (Dressler's syndrome)
* [[Cancer]] that has spread to the pericardium
* [[Trichinosis]]
* [[Kidney failure]] with excessive blood levels of urea [[nitrogen]]
* [[Minoxidil]]
* [[Hypothyroidism]]
* [[Heart surgery]]<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/pericardial-effusion/HQ01198 Pericardial effusion:What are the symptoms?], Dr. Martha Grogan M.D.</ref> (postpericardotomy syndrome)

== Treatment ==
Treatment depends on the underlying cause and the severity of the heart impairment. Pericardial effusion due to a viral infection usually goes away within a few weeks without treatment. Some pericardial effusions remain small and never need treatment.   If the pericardial effusion is due to a condition such as [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]], treatment with anti-inflammatory medications may help. If the effusion is compromising heart function and causing cardiac tamponade, it will need to be drained, most commonly by a needle inserted through the chest wall and into the pericardial space called [[pericardiocentesis]]. A drainage tube is often left in place for several days. In some cases, surgical drainage may be required by cutting through the pericardium creating a [[pericardial window]].
