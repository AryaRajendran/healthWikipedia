'''Acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis''' (APMF) it is a poorly-defined disorder that arises as either a clonal disorder, or following toxic exposure to the [[bone marrow]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Hoffman R, Benz E, Shattil S, Furie B, Cohen H |title=Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |year=2004 |edition=4th}}</ref>

==Presentation==
Bone marrow biopsy shows abnormal [[megakaryocytes]], macrocytic erythropoiesis, and defects in [[neutrophil]] production and fibrosis of the marrow (myelofibrosis). 

Clinically patients present with reduction in the count of all blood cells ([[pancytopenia]]), a very few blasts in the peripheral blood and no or little [[spleen]] enlargement ([[splenomegaly]]).

Cells are usually [[CD34]] positive.<ref name="pmid15578075">{{cite journal |author=Orazi A, O'Malley DP, Jiang J, ''et al.'' |title=Acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis: an entity distinct from acute megakaryoblastic leukemia |journal=Mod.

==Prognosis and treatment==
Median survival is about 9 months.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Autologous stem cell transplantation has been used in treatment.<ref name="pmid17194659">{{cite journal |author=Ngirabacu MC, Ravoet C, Dargent JL, ''et al.'' |title=Long-term follow-up of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in the treatment of a patient with acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis |journal=Haematologica |volume=91 |issue=12 Suppl |pages=ECR53 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17194659 |url=http://www.haematologica.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17194659}}</ref>

==Terminology==
Controversy remains today whether this disorder is a subtype of [[acute myeloid leukemia]] or [[myelodysplastic syndromes]]; however, it is currently classified as a form of AML.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thiele J, Kvasnicka HM, Schmitt-Graeff A |title=Acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis |journal=Leuk.
