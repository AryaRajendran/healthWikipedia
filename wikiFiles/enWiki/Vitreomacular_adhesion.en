'''Vitreomacular adhesion (VMA)''' is a [[human]] [[medical condition]] where the [[vitreous humour|vitreous gel]] (or simply vitreous) of the [[human eye]] adheres to the [[retina]] in an abnormally strong manner. As the eye ages, it is common for the vitreous to separate from the retina. But if this separation is not complete, i.e. there is still an '''adhesion''', this can create pulling forces on the retina that may result in subsequent loss or distortion of vision. The adhesion in of itself is not dangerous, but the resulting pathological [[vitreomacular traction]] (VMT) can cause severe ocular damage.  

The current [[standard of care]] for treating these adhesions is [[vitrectomy|pars plana vitrectomy]] (PPV), which involves surgically removing the vitreous from the eye. A biological agent for non-invasive treatment of adhesions called [[ocriplasmin]] has been approved by the FDA  on Oct 17 2012.

==Pathology==

Over time, it is common for the vitreous within the human eye to [[liquify]] and collapse in processes known as [[Syneresis (chemistry)|syneresis]] and [[synchisis]] respectively. This creates fluid-filled areas that can combine to form pockets of vitreous gel that are mostly liquid with very small concentrations of [[collagen]]. If these liquid pockets are close enough to the interface between the vitreous gel and the retina, they can cause complete separation of the vitreous from the retina in a normally occurring process in older humans called [[posterior vitreous detachment]] (PVD). PVD in of itself is not dangerous and a natural process. 

If the separation of the vitreous from the retina is not complete, areas of focal attachment or adhesions can occur, i.e. a VMA. The pulling forces or traction from this adhesion on the retinal surface can sometimes cause [[edema]] within the retina, damage to retinal blood vessels causing [[bleeding]], or damage to the [[optic nerve]] causing disruption in the [[nerve signal]]s sent to the [[brain]] for [[visual processing]]. It is important to note that while the VMA itself is not dangerous, the resultant pulling on the retina called vitreomacular traction (VMT) causes the above damage. The size and strength of the VMA determine the variety of resulting [[pathologies]] or symptoms.<ref>Paolo Carpineto, Luca Di Antonio, Agbeanda Aharrh-Gnama, Vincenzo Ciciarelli, Leonardo Mastropasqua. Diagnosing and Treating Vitreomacular Adhesion. European Ophthalmic Review, 2011,5(1):69-73</ref>

VMA can also lead to the development of VMT/traction-related complications such as [[macular pucker]]s and [[macular hole]]s leading to [[distorted vision]] or [[metamorphopsia]]; [[epiretinal membrane]]; [[tractional macular oedema]]; [[myopic macular retinoschisis]]; visual impairment; blindness. The incidence of VMA is reported as high as 84% for patients with [[macular hole]], 100% for patients with [[vitreomacular traction syndrome]], and 56% in [[idiopathic epimacular membrane]].<ref>Koerner F, Garweg J. [Diseases of the vitreo-macular interface]. Klin Monbl Augenheilkd. 1999;214(5):305-310.</ref>

==Symptomatic VMA==

Traction caused by VMA is the underlying pathology of an eye disease called symptomatic VMA. There is evidence that symptomatic VMA can contribute to the development of several well-known eye disorders, such as macular hole and macular pucker, that can cause visual impairment, including blindness. It may also be associated with [[age-related macular degeneration]] (AMD), [[diabetic macular edema]] (DME), [[retinal vein occlusion]], and [[diabetic retinopathy]] (DR).

==Diagnosis and Treatment of Symptomatic VMA==

Careful eye examination by an [[ophthalmologist]] is critical for diagnosing symptomatic VMA. Imaging technologies such as [[optical coherence tomography]] (OCT) have significantly improved the accuracy of diagnosing symptomatic VMA.

Today, there is no recommended treatment available for the patient with mild symptomatic VMA. In symptomatic VMA patients with more significant vision loss, the standard of care is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), which involves surgically removing the vitreous from the eye, thereby surgically releasing the symptomatic VMA. In other words, vitrectomy induces PVD to release the traction/adhesion on the retina. An estimated 850,000 vitrectomy procedures are performed globally on an annual basis with 250,000 in the United States alone.

Additionally, PPV may result in incomplete separation, and it may potentially leave a [[Natural reservoir|nidus]] for [[vasoactive]] and [[vasoproliferative]] substances, or it may induce development of [[fibrovascular membrane]]s. As with any invasive surgical procedure, PPV introduces [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] to the vitreous and surrounding tissue.<ref>de Smet MD, Gandorfer A, Stalmans P, et al.

[[Pharmacologic]] vitreolysis is an improvement over invasive surgery as it induces complete separation, creates a more physiologic state of the vitreomacular interface, prevents the development of fibrovascular membranes, is less traumatic to the vitreous, and is potentially [[prophylactic]].<ref>de Smet MD, Gandorfer A, Stalmans P, et al.
