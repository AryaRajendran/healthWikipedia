'''Hirsuties coronae glandis''' (also known as "hirsutoid papillomas"<ref name="Bolognia" /> and "pearly penile papules")<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> are small saliences that may form on the ridge of the [[glans penis|glans]] of the [[human penis]]. They are a harmless anatomical variation.

The papules appear as one or several rows of small, pearly or flesh-colored, smooth, dome-topped bumps situated circumferentially around the [[Corona of glans penis|corona]] or sulcus of the glans. They may range in size from less than 1&nbsp;mm to 3&nbsp;mm.<ref name="genitourinary medicine" /> The condition is common and estimated to be present in a quarter of adult men.<ref name="AH&B"/> The bumps are not transmitted through sexual activity and are not a [[sexually transmitted infection]]. Studies suggest they are found more often on younger men and those who have not been [[circumcision|circumcised]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hogewoning JA, Bleeker MC, den Brule AJ ''et al.'' | year = 2003 | title = Pearly penile papules: Still no reason for uneasiness | url = | journal = J Am Acad Dermatol | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 50–4 }}</ref>

Hirsuties coronae glandis are sometimes described as vestigial remnants of [[penile spines]], sensitive features found in the same location in other primates. However, penile spines in chimps and mice are small surface projections made by piling up of keratinized cell layers in the outer most skin surface.<ref>Hill,W.C.O.Note on the male external genitalia of the chimpanzee.

Anat. 153, 223–231 (1987)</ref>  In contrast, the common structures found in humans are substantially larger, appear to be an outpocketing of both surface and underlying connective tissue layers, and lack the rich innervation seen in other animals.<ref>Glicksman,JM and Freeman, RG. Pearly penile papules. A statistical study of incidence. Arch. Dermatol. 93:56-59 (1966)</ref><ref>Agrawal,SK et al. Pearly penile papules: a review. Int. J. Dermatology 43:199-201 (2004)</ref> Thus the relationship between the structures is still uncertain.<ref name="Penile spines vs. Pearly penile papules in humans" >[http://kingsley.stanford.edu/SpinesVsPapules.html Penile spines versus pearly penile papules in humans]</ref>  In the primate line from which humans have evolved, a regulatory DNA sequence associated with the formation of small keratinized penile spines was lost.<ref name="Human-specific loss of regulatory DNA and the evolution of human-specific traits">[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v471/n7337/abs/nature09774.html Genetic losses contribute to human features]</ref> This particular DNA sequence is missing in all humans tested, so cannot explain why some human males form penile papules and some do not.<ref name="Penile spines vs. Pearly penile papules in humans"/> In species which retain the full expression of penile spines, penile spines contribute to sexual pleasure and quicker orgasms.<ref name="Paleoanthropology, Genetics, and Evolution" >[http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/penis-spines-mclean-2011.html Paleoanthropology, Genetics, and Evolution]</ref>   

A similar expression, [[vestibular papillomatosis]] of the [[vulva]] or ''Hirsuties papillaris vulvae'',<ref>Vestibular papillae of the vulva. Archives Dermatology 126: 1594-1598. Moyal-Barracco M et al. 1990</ref> occurs in females and similarly can be misinterpreted as an outbreak of the HPV infection. Like hirsuties papillaris genitalis, it is a normal variation on human anatomy.<ref>[http://www.gyncph.dk/procedur/ref/gyn/vulvoscopi_chapter14_eagc.pdf Colposcopy of the Vulva, Perineum and Anal Canal]</ref>

==Medical removal==

While hirsuties papillaris genitalis pose no risk to a male's health or sex life, some men or their sexual partners may consider them [[aesthetically]] displeasing.<ref>http://www.nomorepapules.com/WhatisPPP.html</ref> There are several medical ways to remove them.  Like any elective medical procedure, there is always some risk of unexpected consequences, so doctors advise against their removal unless they are causing a patient serious problems.<ref name="genitourinary medicine">Oxford handbook of genitourinary medicine, HIV, and AIDS, Volume 13 by Richard Pattman, Michael Snow, Pauline Handy, Babiker Elawad</ref>

One of the available treatments is performed by a dermatologist, using a CO<sub>2</sub> laser to vaporise the papules.  This normally takes only a few minutes to perform.<ref name="AH&B">[http://www.americanhealthandbeauty.com/articles/?article=1786 CO2 Laser Treats Pearly Penile Papules] American Health & beauty Magazine,  Dr. William Groff, Friday, July 10, 2009</ref> It is simple and does not normally require a hospital stay; discomfort should be minimal and the expected recovery time is limited to a few days. Another procedure involves [[electrosurgery]] performed with a [[hyfrecator]] and should take less than an hour to perform.<ref>[http://www.pearlypenilepapules.co.uk/ Pearly Penile Papules Centre, London]</ref>

Both procedures should be [[out-patient]] procedures if no complications arise.

==Myths and misunderstandings ==

Although it is not related to any pathological condition, hirsuties papillaris genitalis is occasionally mistaken for [[genital wart|HPV warts]].<ref name="AIDS">Human papillomavirus, and vaccination by Dr Laura Pye. InnovAiT, Royal College of General Practitioners, 2009</ref>  Home remedies abound for "curing" it.<ref name="genitourinary medicine" />  

Some of the "home remedies" found on the Internet and elsewhere use mild ointments or creams to soften the papules, but others are physically dangerous techniques for papule removal which can result in permanent genital mutilation.  Rapini ''et al.'' advise that, since dermatologists have safe, effective ways to remove them if desired, home remedies involving corrosive substances or self-surgery should be avoided, since they can permanently damage sexual functioning.  They further state that removal should only be performed by a physician using proven medical techniques.<ref name="Bolognia" />
