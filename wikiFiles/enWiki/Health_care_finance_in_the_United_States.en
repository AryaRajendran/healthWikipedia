Health care spending in the United States is characterized as being the most costly per person as compared to all other countries, and despite this spending, the quality of health care overall is low by some measures.

According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), total health care spending in the U.S. was 15.2% of its [[gross domestic product|GDP]] in 2008, the [[List of countries by total health expenditure (PPP) per capita|highest]] in the world.<ref name="WHO 2011">{{cite book|author=WHO|year=2011|title=World health statistics 2011|location=Geneva|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-92-4-156419-9|url=http://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_statistics/2011/en/index.html}}</ref> The Health and Human Services Department expects that the health share of GDP will continue its historical upward trend, reaching 19.5% of GDP by 2017.<ref name="NHE Fact Sheet">[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/25_NHE_Fact_Sheet.asp#TopOfPage "National Health Expenditure Data: NHE Fact Sheet,"] [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]], referenced February 26, 2008</ref><ref name="Sean Keehan 2008">Sean Keehan, Andrea Sisko, Christopher Truffer, Sheila Smith, Cathy Cowan, John Poisal, M.

Around 84.7% of Americans have some form of [[Health insurance in the United States|health insurance]]; either through their employer or the employer of their spouse or parent (59.3%), purchased individually (8.9%), or provided by government programs (27.8%; there is some overlap in these figures).<ref name="Census 2007">[http://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/p60-235.pdf "Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2007."] U.S. Census Bureau.

Among those whose employer pays for health insurance, the employee may be required to contribute part of the cost of this insurance, while the employer usually chooses the insurance company and, for large groups, negotiates with the insurance company. Government programs directly cover 27.8% of the population (83&nbsp;million),<ref name="Census 2007"/> including the elderly, disabled, children, veterans, and some of the poor, and federal law mandates public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay.

Some Americans do not qualify for government-provided health insurance, are not provided health insurance by an employer, and are unable to afford, cannot qualify for, or choose not to purchase, private health insurance.  When charity or "uncompensated" care is not available, they sometimes simply go without needed medical treatment.  This problem has become a source of considerable political controversy on a national level.

One analysis of international spending levels in the year 2000 found that while the U.S. spends more on health care than other countries in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the use of health care services in the U.S. is below the OECD median by most measures.

Health care spending in the United States is concentrated.  An analysis of the 2008 and 2009 data by [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ)  found that the 1% of the population with the highest spending accounted for 27% of aggregate health care spending.  The highest-spending 5% of the population accounted for more than half of all spending.

There are significant geographic variations in the level of care provided to chronically ill patients, only 4% of which are explained by differences in the number of severely ill people in an area. Most of the differences are explained by differences in the amount of "supply-sensitive" care available in an area.  Acute hospital care accounts for over half (55%) of the spending for Medicare beneficiaries in the last two years of life, and differences in the volume of services provided is more significant than differences in price.  The researchers found no evidence of "substitution" of care, where increased use of hospital care would reduce outpatient spending (or vice versa).<ref name=DartmouthAtlas2008/><ref>[http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?DR_ID=52442 "Coverage & Access | More Aggressive Hospital Care Does Not Lead to Improved Patient Outcomes in All Cases, Study Finds,"] Kaiser Daily Health Policy Report, [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], May 30, 2008</ref>

===Impact on U.S. economic productivity===
On March 1, 2010, billionaire investor [[Warren Buffett]] said that the high costs paid by U.S. companies for their employees' health care put them at a competitive disadvantage. He compared the roughly 17% of GDP spent by the U.S. on health care with the 9% of GDP spent by much of the rest of the world, noted that the U.S. has fewer doctors and nurses per person, and said, "[t]hat kind of a cost, compared with the rest of the world, is like a tapeworm eating at our economic body."<ref>{{Cite news | last = Funk | first = Josh | title = Buffett says economy recovering but at slow rate | newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com) | date = March 1, 2010 | url = http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-03-01/business/18371919_1_berkshire-hathaway-billionaire-warren-buffett-health-care | accessdate = Apr. 3, 2010}}{{dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref>

In December 2011, the outgoing Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Dr. [[Donald Berwick]], asserted that 20% to 30% of health care spending is waste.

==Payment==
{{See also|Bundled payment|Capitation (healthcare)|Fee-for-service}}
Doctors and hospitals are generally funded by payments from patients and insurance plans in return for services rendered ([[fee-for-service]] or FFS). 

Around 84.7% of Americans have some form of [[Health insurance in the United States|health insurance]]; either through their employer or the employer of their spouse or parent (59.3%), purchased individually (8.9%), or provided by government programs (27.8%; there is some overlap in these figures).<ref name="Census 2007"/> All government health care programs have restricted eligibility, and there is no government health insurance company which covers all Americans. Americans without health insurance coverage in 2007 totaled 15.3% of the population, or 45.7&nbsp;million people.<ref name="Census 2007" />

Among those whose employer pays for health insurance, the employee may be required to contribute part of the cost of this insurance, while the employer usually chooses the insurance company and, for large groups, negotiates with the insurance company. 

In 2004, private insurance paid for 36% of personal health expenditures, private out-of-pocket 15%, federal government 34%, state and local governments 11%, and other private funds 4%.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus07.pdf Health, United States, 2007]. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics.</ref>  Due to "a dishonest and inefficient system" that sometimes inflates bills to ten times the actual cost, even insured patients can be billed more than the real cost of their care.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-lopez22-2009nov22,0,7367540.column?page=1 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=The emergency room bill is enough to make you sick | first=Steve | last=Lopez | date=November 22, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>

Insurance for dental and vision care (except for visits to [[ophthalmologists]], which are covered by regular health insurance) is usually sold separately. Prescription drugs are often handled differently than medical services, including by the government programs.  Major federal laws regulating the insurance industry include [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985|COBRA]] and [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]].

Individuals with private or government insurance are limited to medical facilities which accept the particular type of medical insurance they carry.  Visits to facilities outside the insurance program's "network" are usually either not covered or the patient must bear more of the cost.  Hospitals negotiate with insurance programs to set reimbursement rates; some rates for government insurance programs are set by law.  The sum paid to a doctor for a service rendered to an insured patient is generally less than that paid "out of pocket" by an uninsured patient.  In return for this discount, the insurance company includes the doctor as part of their "network", which means more patients are eligible for lowest-cost treatment there.  The negotiated rate may not cover the cost of the service, but providers (hospitals and doctors) can refuse to accept a given type of insurance, including Medicare and Medicaid.  Low reimbursement rates have generated complaints from providers, and some patients with government insurance have difficulty finding nearby providers for certain types of medical services.

[[Charity care]] for those who cannot pay is sometimes available, and is usually funded by non-profit foundations, religious orders, government subsidies, or services donated by the employees.  Massachusetts and New Jersey have programs where the state will pay for health care when the patient cannot afford to do so.<ref>See [[Massachusetts health care reform]] for Massachusetts and [[charity care]] for New Jersey.</ref> The City and County of San Francisco is also implementing a [[Healthy San Francisco|citywide health care program]] for all uninsured residents, limited to those whose incomes and net worth are below an eligibility threshold. Some cities and counties operate or provide subsidies to private facilities open to all regardless of the ability to pay. Means testing is applied, and some patients of limited means may be charged for the services they use.

The [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]] requires virtually all hospitals to accept all patients, regardless of the ability to pay, for [[emergency room]] care. The act does not provide access to non-emergency room care for patients who cannot afford to pay for health care, nor does it provide the benefit of preventive care and the [[Health care continuity|continuity]] of a [[primary care physician]]. Emergency health care is generally more expensive than an [[urgent care]] clinic or a doctor's office visit, especially if a condition has worsened due to putting off needed care. Emergency rooms are typically at, near, or over capacity.  Long wait times have become a problem nationally, and in urban areas some ERs are put on "diversion" on a regular basis, meaning that ambulances are directed to bring patients elsewhere.<ref>See [[emergency department]] for details.</ref>

===Private===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2009}}
[[File:U.S. Health Insurance Status - Under 65 yrs.png|thumb|right|Share by insurance coverage type, for those under 65 years of age]]
Most Americans under age 65 (59.3%) receive their health insurance coverage through an employer (which includes both private as well as civilian public-sector employers) under [[group insurance|group coverage]], although this percentage is declining. Costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising rapidly: since 2001, premiums for family coverage have increased 78%, while wages have risen 19% and inflation has risen 17%, according to a 2007 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation.<ref name="Kaiser2007"/> Workers with employer-sponsored insurance also contribute; in 2007, the average percentage of premium paid by covered workers is 16% for single coverage and 28% for family coverage.<ref name="Kaiser2007"/> In addition to their premium contributions, most covered workers face additional payments when they use health care services, in the form of deductibles and copayments.

Just less than 9% of the population purchases individual health care insurance.<ref name="Census 2007"/> Insurance payments are a form of cost-sharing and risk management where each individual or their employer pays predictable monthly premiums. This cost-spreading mechanism often picks up much of the cost of health care, but individuals must often pay up-front a minimum part of the total cost (a ''deductible''), or a small part of the cost of every procedure (a [[copayment]]). Private insurance accounts for 35% of total health spending in the United States, by far the largest share among OECD countries. Beside the United States, Canada and France are the two other OECD countries where private insurance represents more than 10% of total health spending.<ref name="OECD 2009">{{cite web

Provider networks can be used to reduce costs by negotiating favorable fees from providers, selecting cost effective providers, and creating financial incentives for providers to practice more efficiently.<ref name=autogenerated1>Managed Care: Integrating the Delivery and Financing of Health Care - Part A, Health Insurance Association of America, 1995, p. 9 ISBN 1-879143-26-1{{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (1) does not correspond to calculated figure.}}</ref>  A survey issued in 2009 by [[America's Health Insurance Plans]] found that patients going to out-of-network providers are sometimes charged extremely high fees.<ref>[http://www.ahipresearch.org/PDFs/ValueSurvey/AllStatesReport.pdf ''THE VALUE OF PROVIDER NETWORKS AND THE ROLE OF OUT-OF-NETWORK CHARGES IN RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS: A SURVEY OF CHARGES BILLED BY OUT-OF-NETWORK PHYSICIANS''], [[America's Health Insurance Plans]], August 2009</ref><ref>Gina Kolata, [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/12/health/policy/12insure.html "Survey Finds High Fees Common in Medical Care"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 11, 2009</ref>

Defying many analysts' expectations, PPOs have gained market share at the expense of HMOs over the past decade.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hurley RE, Strunk BC, White JS |title=The puzzling popularity of the PPO |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=56–68 |year=2004 |pmid=15046131 |doi= 10.1377/hlthaff.23.2.56 |url= http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15046131}}</ref>

Just as the more loosely managed PPOs have edged out HMOs, HMOs themselves have also evolved towards less tightly managed models. The first HMOs in the U.S., such as [[Kaiser Permanente]] in Oakland, California, and the Health Insurance Plan (HIP) in New York, were "staff-model" HMOs, which owned their own health care facilities and employed the doctors and other health care professionals who staffed them. The name health maintenance organization stems from the idea that the HMO would make it its job to maintain the enrollee's health, rather than merely to treat illnesses. In accordance with this mission, managed care organizations typically cover preventive health care. Within the tightly integrated staff-model HMO, the HMO can develop and disseminate guidelines on cost-effective care, while the enrollee's primary care doctor can act as patient advocate and care coordinator, helping the patient negotiate the complex health care system. Despite a substantial body of research demonstrating that many staff-model HMOs deliver high-quality and cost-effective care, they have steadily lost market share. They have been replaced by more loosely managed networks of providers with whom health plans have negotiated discounted fees. It is common today for a physician or hospital to have contracts with a dozen or more health plans, each with different referral networks, contracts with different diagnostic facilities, and different practice guidelines.

===Public===
Government programs directly cover 27.8% of the population (83&nbsp;million),<ref name="Census 2007"/> including the elderly, disabled, children, veterans, and some of the poor, and federal law mandates public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay. Public spending accounts for between 45% and 56.1% of U.S. health care spending.<ref name="content.healthaffairs.org"/>  Per-capita spending on health care by the U.S. government placed it among the top ten highest spenders among United Nations member countries in 2004.<ref>[http://www.who.int/whosis/database/core/core_select_process.cfm?strISO3_select=ALL&strIndicator_select=nha&intYear_select=latest&fixed=indicator&language=english Core Health Indicators: Per capita government expenditure on health at average exchange rate] World Health Organization. Retrieved 2007-10-05.</ref>  

However, all government-funded healthcare programs exist only in the form of [[statute|statutory]] law, and accordingly can be amended or revoked like any other statute.  There is no constitutional right to healthcare.  The U.S. Supreme Court explained in 1977 that "the Constitution imposes no obligation on the States to pay ... any of the medical expenses of indigents."<ref>''Maher v. Roe'', {{ussc|432|464|1977}}.</ref>

Government funded programs include:
* [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], generally covering citizens and long-term residents 65 years and older and the disabled.
* [[Medicaid]], generally covering low income people in certain categories, including children, pregnant women, and the disabled. (Administered by the states.)
* [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]], which provides health insurance for low-income children who do not qualify for Medicaid. (Administered by the states, with matching state funds.)
* Various programs for federal employees, including [[TRICARE]] for military personnel (for use in civilian facilities)
* The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]], which provides care to veterans, their families, and survivors through medical centers and clinics.<ref>[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/home/medicare.asp Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services: Medicare]</ref>
*[[Title X]] which funds reproductive health care
*State and local health department clinics
*[[Indian health service]]
*[[National Institutes of Health]] treats patients who enroll in research for free.
*Medical Corps of various branches of the military.
*Certain county and state hospitals
*Government run community clinics

The exemption of employer-sponsored health benefits from federal income and payroll taxes distorts the health care market.<ref>[http://www.cato.org/pubs/tbb/tbb-0505-23.pdf How the Tax Code Distorts Health Care] Cato Institute</ref> The U.S. government, unlike some other countries, does not treat employer funded health care benefits as a taxable benefit in kind to the employee.

Health insurance benefits are an attractive way for employers to increase the salary of employees as they are nontaxable. As a result, 65% of the non-elderly population and over 90% of the privately insured non-elderly population receives health insurance at the workplace.<ref name="nafe.net">[http://www.nafe.net/JFE/j15_2_05.pdf Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance: Past, Present and Future] Journal of Forensic Economics</ref> Additionally, most economists agree that this tax shelter increases individual demand for health insurance, leading some to claim that it is largely responsible for the rise in health care spending.<ref name="nafe.net"/>  

In addition the government allows full tax shelter at the highest marginal rate to investors in [[health savings account]]s (HSAs). Some have argued that this tax incentive adds little value to national health care as a whole because the most wealthy in society tend also to be the most healthy.  Also it has been argued, HSAs segregate the insurance pools into those for the wealthy and those for the less wealthy which thereby makes equivalent insurance cheaper for the rich and more expensive for the poor.<ref>[http://finance.senate.gov/Testimony%20of%20Robert%20Greenstein.pdf LATEST ENROLLMENT DATA STILL FAIL TO DISPEL CONCERNS ABOUT HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS: The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]</ref>  However, one advantage of health insurance accounts is that funds can only be used towards certain HSA qualified expenses, including medicine, doctor's fees, and Medicare Parts A and B.

There are also various state and local programs for the poor. In 2007, Medicaid provided health care coverage for 39.6&nbsp;million low-income Americans (although Medicaid covers approximately 40% of America's poor),<ref>[http://www2.citizen.org/hrg/medicaid/assets/reports/2007UnsettlingScores.pdf Unsettling Scores: A Ranking of State Medicaid Programs, P. 15]</ref> and Medicare provided health care coverage for 41.4&nbsp;million elderly and disabled Americans.<ref name="Census 2007"/> Enrollment in Medicare is expected to reach 77&nbsp;million by 2031, when the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]] generation is fully enrolled.<ref name="CMS Stats">{{cite web |url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/CapMarketUpdates/Downloads/2006CMSstat.pdf |title=Health and Human Services Statistics 2006 | accessdate=2007-07-03 |format=PDF |work=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070628214810/http://www.cms.hhs.gov/CapMarketUpdates/Downloads/2006CMSstat.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-28}}</ref>

===The uninsured===
{{Main|Health insurance coverage in the United States}}
Some Americans do not qualify for government-provided health insurance, are not provided health insurance by an employer, and are unable to afford, cannot qualify for, or choose not to purchase, private health insurance.  When charity or "uncompensated" care is not available, they sometimes simply go without needed medical treatment.  This problem has become a source of considerable political controversy on a national level.

According to the [[US Census Bureau]], in 2007, 45.7&nbsp;million people in the U.S. (15.3% of the population) were without health insurance for at least part of the year. This number was down slightly from the previous year, with nearly 3&nbsp;million more people receiving government coverage and a slightly lower percentage covered under private plans than the year previous.<ref name="Census 2007"/>  Other studies have placed the number of uninsured in the years 2007–2008 as high as 86.7&nbsp;million, about 29% of the US population.<ref name="familiesusa.org">Families USA (2009) press release summarizing a Lewin Group (wholly owned by United Healthcare insurance company) study: "New Report Finds 86.7&nbsp;Million Americans Were Uninsured at Some Point in 2007-2008" [http://www.familiesusa.org/resources/newsroom/press-releases/2009-press-releases/one-of-three-uninsured.html]</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">http://www.familiesusa.org/assets/pdfs/americans-at-risk.pdf</ref>

Among the uninsured population, the Census Bureau says, nearly 37&nbsp;million were employment-age adults (ages&nbsp;18 to 64), and more than 27&nbsp;million worked at least part-time. About 38% of the uninsured live in households with incomes of $50,000 or more.<ref name="Census 2007"/> According to the Census Bureau, nearly 36&nbsp;million of the uninsured are legal U.S citizens. Another 9.7&nbsp;million are noncitizens, but the Census Bureau does not distinguish in its estimate between legal noncitizens and illegal immigrants.<ref name="Census 2007"/> Nearly one fifth of the uninsured population is able to afford insurance, almost one quarter is eligible for public coverage, and the remaining 56% need financial assistance (8.9% of all Americans).<ref>Dubay L, Holahan J and Cook A.,[http://www.healthaffairs.org/RWJ/Dubay2.pdf The Uninsured and the Affordability of Health Insurance Coverage], ''Health Affairs'' (Web Exclusive), November 2006.

A 2003 study in ''Health Affairs'' estimated that uninsured people in the U.S. received approximately $35&nbsp;billion in uncompensated care in 2001.<ref>Jack Hadley and John Holahan,[http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/abstract/hlthaff.w3.66 How Much Medical Care Do the Uninsured Use and Who Pays for It?], Health Affairs Web Exclusive, 2003-02-13. Retrieved 2007-10-05.</ref> The study noted that this amount per capita was half what the average insured person received. The study found that various levels of government finance most uncompensated care, spending about $30.6&nbsp;billion on payments and programs to serve the uninsured and covering as much as 80–85% of uncompensated care costs through grants and other direct payments, tax appropriations, and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and Medicaid payment add-ons. Most of this money comes from the federal government, followed by state and local tax appropriations for hospitals. Another study by the same authors in the same year estimated the additional annual cost of covering the [[uninsured]] (in 2001&nbsp;dollars) at $34&nbsp;billion (for public coverage) and $69&nbsp;billion (for private coverage). These estimates represent an increase in total health care spending of 3–6% and would raise health care's share of GDP by less than one percentage point, the study concluded.<ref>Jack Hadley and John Holahan, [http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.w3.250v1/DC1 Covering The Uninsured: How Much Would It Cost?], Health Affairs Web Exclusive, 2003-06-04. Retrieved 2007-10-05.</ref> Another study published in the same journal in 2004 estimated that the value of health forgone each year because of uninsurance was $65–$130&nbsp;billion and concluded that this figure constituted "a lower-bound estimate of economic losses resulting from the present level of uninsurance nationally."<ref>Wilhelmine Miller, Elizabeth Richardson Vigdor, and Willard G.

The health insurance system in America, in contrast with health insurance in almost all other developed nations, is fundamentally a voluntary one. There are many perspectives on the purpose of health insurance in the United States. For consumers, health insurance serves two main purposes: it provides access to affordable health care through preferential pricing and it offers financial protection from unexpected health care costs. For clinicians and other health care providers, insurance ensures financial stability of the practice/office. Health insurance was first developed by Baylor University Hospital for exactly that purpose.<ref>Porter, M.E., and E.O. Teisberg. 2006. Redefining health care: Creating value-based competition on results. Cambridge, Ma: Harvard Business Press.</ref> 

From 2000 to 2004, the [[Institute of Medicine]]'s Committee on the Consequences of Uninsurance issued a series of six reports that reviewed and reported on the evidence on the effects of the lack of health insurance coverage.<ref name="IOM 2004">{{cite book|author=Institute of Medicine. Committee on the Consequences of Uninsurance|date=January 13, 2004|title=Insuring America's health: principles and recommendations|location=Washington, DC|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-52826-9|page=25|url=http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2004/Insuring-Americas-Health-Principles-and-Recommendations.aspx}}</ref>

The reports concluded that the committee recommended that the nation should implement a strategy to achieve universal health insurance coverage. As of 2011, a comprehensive national plan to address what universal health plan supporters terms "America's uninsured crisis", has yet to be enacted. A few states have achieved progress towards the goal of universal health insurance coverage, such as Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont, but other states including California, have failed attempts of reforms.<ref name="COM">Committee on Health Insurance Status and Its Consequences (Author). America's Uninsured Crisis : Consequences for Health and Health Care. Washington, DC, USA: National Academies Press, 2009</ref> 

The six reports created by the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) found that the principal consequences of uninsurance were the following: Children and Adults without health insurance did not receive needed medical care; they typically live in poorer health and die earlier than children or adults who have insurance. The financial stability of a whole family can be put at risk if only one person is uninsured and needs treatment for unexpected health care costs. The overall health status of a community can be adversely affected by a higher percentage of uninsured people within the community. The coverage gap between the insured and the uninsured has not decreased even after the recent federal initiatives to extend health insurance coverage.<ref name="COM" />

The last report was published in 2004 and was named Insuring America's Health: Principles and Recommendations. This report recommended the following: The President and Congress need to develop a strategy to achieve universal insurance coverage and establish a firm schedule to reach this goal by the year 2010. The committee also recommended that the federal and state governments provide sufficient resources for Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to cover all persons currently eligible until the universal coverage takes effect. They also warned that the federal and state governments should prevent the erosion of outreach efforts, eligibility, enrollment, and coverage of these specific programs.<ref name="COM" />

Some people think that not having health insurance will have adverse consequences for the health of the uninsured.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fisher E. S., Wennberg D. E., Stukel T.

Children in America are typically perceived as in good health relative to adults, due to the fact that most serious health problems occur later in one's life. Certain conditions including asthma, diabetes, and obesity have become much more prevalent among children in the past few decades.<ref name="COM" /> There is also a growing population of vulnerable children with special health care needs that require ongoing medical attention, which would not be accessible without health insurance. More than 10 million children in the United States meet the federal definition of children with special health care needs "who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical, development, behavioral, or emotional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally".<ref>American Academy of Pediatrics. 2008. Definition of children with special health care needs (CSHCN), http://www.medicalhomeinfo.org/about/def_cshcn.html (accessed December 4, 2011).</ref> These children require health related services of an amount beyond that required by the average children in America. Typically when children acquire health insurance, they are much less likely to experience previously unmet health care needs, this includes the average child in America and children with special health care needs.<ref name="COM" /> The Committee on Health Insurance Status and Its Consequences concluded that the effects of health insurance on children's health outcomes: Children with health insurance receive more timely diagnosis of serious health conditions, experience fewer hospitalizations, and miss fewer days of school.

The same committee analyzed the effects of health insurance on adult's health outcomes: adults who do not have health insurance coverage who acquire Medicare coverage at age 65, experience substantially improved health and functional status, particularly those who have cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Adults who have cardiovascular disease or other cardiac risk factors that are uninsured are less likely to be aware of their condition, which leads to worse health outcomes for those individuals. Without health insurance, adults are more likely to be diagnosed with certain cancers that would have been detectable earlier by screening by a clinician if they had regularly visited a doctor. As a consequence, these adults are more likely to die from their diagnosed cancer or suffer poorer health outcomes.<ref name="COM" />

Many towns and cities in the United States have high concentrations of people under the age of 65 who lack health insurance.<ref>DeNavas-Walt, C., B. D. Proctor, and J. Smith. 2008. Income, poverty, and health insurance coverage in the United State: 2007. Washington, DC. U.S Census Bureau.</ref> There are implications of high rates of uninsurance for communities and for insured people in those communities.

Estimates for 2008 reported that the uninsured would spend $30 billion for healthcare and receive $56 billion in uncompensated care, and that if everyone were covered by insurance then overall costs would increase by $123 billion.<ref>http://www.kff.org/uninsured/kcmu082508pkg.cfm</ref>  A 2003 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report estimated total cost of health care provided to the uninsured at $98.9 billion in 2001, including $26.4 billion in out-of-pocket spending by the uninsured, with $34.5 billion in "free" "uncompensated" care covered by government subsidies of $30.6 billion to hospitals and clinics and $5.1 billion in donated services by physicians.<ref name="IOM 2003b">{{cite book|author=Institute of Medicine.

However, as the OECD has pointed out, the total U.S. public expenditure for this limited population would, in most other OECD countries, be enough for the government to provide primary health insurance for the entire population.<ref name="OECD 2009"/> Although the federal Medicare program and the federal-state Medicaid programs possess some [[monopsony|monopsonistic]] purchasing power, the highly fragmented buy side of the U.S. health system is relatively weak by international standards, and in some areas, some suppliers such as large hospital groups have a virtual monopoly on the supply side.<ref name="prices stupid">
