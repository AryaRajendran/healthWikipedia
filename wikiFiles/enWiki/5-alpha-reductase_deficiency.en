'''5α-Reductase deficiency''' ('''5-ARD''') is an [[autosomal recessive]] [[intersexuality|intersex]] [[medical condition|condition]] caused by a [[genetic mutation|mutation]] of the [[5α reductase type II]] [[gene]].<ref name="Gpnotebook">{{GPnotebook|852492298|5-alpha reductase deficiency}}</ref>

==Normal function==
[[5α-Reductase]] is an [[enzyme]] that converts [[testosterone]] to [[5α-dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) in peripheral tissues. These enzymes also participate in the creation of such [[neurosteroid]]s as [[allopregnanolone]] and [[Tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone|THDOC]], convert progesterone into dihydroprogesterone (DHP), and convert deoxycorticosterone (DOC) into dihydrodeoxycorticosterone (DHDOC). 5-ARD is biochemically characterized by low to low-normal levels of testosterone and decreased levels of DHT, creating a higher testosterone/DHT ratio.

[[Image:Test biosynth 5ARD2.jpg|thumb|center|600px| Biochemical effects of 5-ARD in testosterone biosynthesis.  Levels of testosterone are elevated, while levels of DHT are significantly decreased, leading to male [[undervirilization]].]]

DHT is a potent [[androgen]], and is necessary for the development of male external [[genitalia]] in utero.

==Signs==
The condition affects only genetic males (that is, those with a [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]]) because DHT has no known role in female development.<ref>[http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic1980.htm eMedicine article on 5-ARD]</ref>

Individuals with 5-ARD can have normal male external genitalia, [[ambiguous genitalia]], or normal female genitalia. They are born with [[male]] [[gonad]]s, including [[testicles]] and [[Wolffian structures]], but usually have [[female]] [[primary sex characteristic]]s. As a consequence, they are often raised as girls, but usually have a male [[gender identity]].<ref>{{cite journal | title = Gender identity of children and young adults with 5alpha-reductase deficiency. | journal = J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. | date = February 2008 | coauthors = Praveen EP, Desai AK, Khurana ML, Philip J, Eunice M, Khadgawat R, Kulshreshtha B, Kucheria K, Gupta DK, Seith A, Ammini AC. | volume = 21 | edition = 2 | pages = 173–179 | pmid = 18422030 | issue = 2 | last1 = Praveen | first1 = EP}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM197905313002201 | title = Androgens and the Evolution of Male-Gender Identity among Male Pseudohermaphrodites with 5α-Reductase Deficiency | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | date = May 31, 1979 | coauthors = Julianne Imperato-McGinley, M.D., Ralph E. Peterson, M.D., Teofilo Gautier, M.D., and Erasmo Sturla, M.D. | volume = 300 | pages = 1233–1237 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM197905313002201 | last1 = Imperato-Mcginley | first1 = Julianne | issue = 22 | pmid = 431680}}</ref>

In general, individuals with 5-ARD are capable of producing viable [[sperm]]. In individuals with feminized or ambiguous genitalia, there is a tendency towards a [[clitoromegaly|macroclitoris]] or [[micropenis]], and the [[urethra]] may attach to the phallus. This structure may be capable of ejaculations as well as erections, but may be insufficient for [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]].

At [[puberty]], individuals often have primary [[amenorrhoea]] and may experience [[virilization]]. This may include descending of the testes, [[hirsutism]] (facial/body hair considered normal in males - not to be confused with [[hypertrichosis]]), deepening of the voice, and enlargement of the clitoris. In adulthood, individuals do not experience male-pattern baldness.<ref name="Gpnotebook"/> As DHT is a far more potent androgen than testosterone alone, virilization in those lacking DHT may be absent or reduced compared to males with functional 5-AR. It is hypothesized that rising testosterone levels at the start of puberty (around age twelve) are able to generate sufficient levels of DHT either by the action of [[5α-reductase type I]] (active in the adult liver, non-genital skin and some brain areas) or through the expression of low levels of 5α-reductase type II in the testes.

===Infertility===
There is an increased risk of [[cryptorchidism]] in 5-ARD, causing infertility, but also a higher risk of [[testicular cancer]]. Fertility is further compromised by the underdevelopment of seminal vesicles and prostate.

On the other hand, fertility depending on female characteristics is impossible; although the external genitalia may be female, the vagina consists of only the lower two-thirds of a normal vagina, creating a blind-ending vaginal pouch. Due to the normal action of [[Anti-müllerian hormone|Müllerian inhibiting factor]] produced by the [[testes]] in utero, individuals with 5-ARD lack a [[uterus]] and [[Fallopian tube]]s. Thus, individuals with 5-ARD are not able to carry a pregnancy, and, since they have testes and not ovaries, they are unable to create ova, which precludes such infertility treatments as surrogate motherhood.

==Prevalence==
The number of people with this condition varies relative to geographic location, depending on how much of a given population is interrelated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In a small remote village in the Dominican Republic 12 out of 13 families were affected. Here, the incidence was 1:90 males.<ref name=sci001>{{cite journal | last1 = Imperato-McGinley | first1 = Julianne | last2 = Guerrero | first2 = Luis | last3 = Gautier | first3 = Teofilo | last4 = Peterson | first4 = Ralph Edward | title = Steroid 5alpha-reductase deficiency in man: an inherited form of male pseudohermaphroditism | journal = Science | volume = 186 | issue = 4170 | pages = 1213–1215 | year = 1974 | month = December | doi = 10.1126/science.186.4170.1213 | pmid = 4432067}}</ref>

==In Popular Culture==
In the [[Nip/Tuck]] season three episode "Quentin Costa", it is revealed that Dr. [[Quentin Costa]] had 5-ARD.

[[Jeffrey Eugenides]]' Pulitzer Prize-winning 2002 novel ''[[Middlesex_(novel)|Middlesex]]'' is about a young man with 5-ARD. The character was originally born Calliope and raised as a girl, but upon realizing his true biological sex, he transitions into Cal. Eugenides himself does not have the deficiency.
