'''Acute interstitial pneumonitis''' (also known as '''acute interstitial pneumonia''' or '''Hamman–Rich syndrome''') is a rare, severe [[lung]] disease that usually affects otherwise healthy individuals. 

As of 2012, there is no known cause or cure. 

Acute interstitial pneumonitis is often categorized as both an [[interstitial lung disease]] and a form of [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS) but it is distinguished from the ''chronic'' forms of interstitial pneumonia such as [[idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hamman L., Rich A.R. |title=Acute diffuse interstitial fibrosis of the lungs |journal=Bull. Johns Hopkins Hosp. |volume=74 |pages=177–212 |year=1944 }}</ref>

== Symptoms ==
The most common symptoms of acute interstitial pneumonitis are [[highly productive cough with expectoration of thick mucus]], [[fever]], and [[shortness of breath|difficulties breathing]]. These often occur over a period of one to two weeks before medical attention is sought. The presence of fluid means the person experiences a feeling similar to 'drowning'. Difficulties breathing can quickly progress to an inability to breathe without support ([[respiratory failure]]).

Acute interstitial pneumonitis typically progresses rapidly, with hospitalization and mechanical ventilation often required only days to weeks after initial symptoms of [[cough]], [[fever]], and [[shortness of breath|difficulties breathing]] develop.

== Diagnosis ==
Rapid progression from initial symptoms to respiratory failure is a key feature. An x-ray that shows ARDS is necessary for diagnosis (fluid in the small air sacs ([[alveoli]]) in both lungs). In addition, a [[biopsy]] of the lung that shows organizing [[diffuse alveolar damage]] is required for diagnosis. Other diagnostic tests are useful in excluding other similar conditions, but history, x-ray, and biopsy are essential. These other tests may include basic blood work, blood cultures, and [[bronchoalveolar lavage]].
The clinical picture is similar to ARDS, but AIP differs from ARDS in that the cause for AIP is not known.

== Treatment ==
Treatment is primarily supportive. Management in an [[intensive care unit]] is required and the need for [[mechanical ventilation]] is common. Therapy with [[corticosteroids]] is generally attempted, though their usefulness has not been established. The only treatment that has met with success to date is a [[lung transplant]].

== Epidemiology ==
Acute interstitial pneumonitis occurs most frequently among people older than forty years old. It affects men and women equally. There are no known risk factors; in particular, [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] is not associated with increased risk.

== Prognosis ==
Sixty percent of people with acute interstitial pneumonitis will die in the first six months of illness.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Bouros | first=D | coauthors=Nicholson AC, Polychronopoulos V, du Bois RM | title=Acute interstitial pneumonia |journal=Eur. Respir. J. |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=412–8 |year=2000 |pmid=10706513 |doi=10.1034/j.1399-3003.2000.15b31.x |url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10706513}}</ref> The median survival is 1½ months.

However, most people who have one episode do not have a second. People who survive often recover lung function completely.

== History ==
Acute interstitial pneumonitis was first described in 1935 by [[Louis Hamman]] and [[Arnold Rice Rich|Arnold Rich]], and given the name Hamman–Rich syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Hamman | first=L | coauthors=Rich AR | title=Fulminating diffuse interstitial fibrosis of the lungs | journal=Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association | volume=51 | pages=154–163 | publisher=European Respiratory Society | year=1935 }}</ref>
