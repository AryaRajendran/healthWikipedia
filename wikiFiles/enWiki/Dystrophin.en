'''Dystrophin''' is a rod-shaped [[cytoplasmic]] [[protein]], and a vital part of a [[protein complex]] that connects the [[cytoskeleton]] of a [[muscle fiber]] to the surrounding [[extracellular matrix]] through the [[cell membrane]].  This complex is variously known as the [[costamere]] or the [[dystrophin-associated protein complex]].  Many muscle proteins, such as α-[[dystrobrevin]], [[syncoilin]], [[synemin]], [[sarcoglycan]], [[dystroglycan]], and [[sarcospan]], colocalize with dystrophin at the costamere.

The dystrophin gene is one of the longest human genes known, covering 2.2 [[megabase]]s (0.07% of the human genome) at [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] [[X chromosome|Xp21]]. The [[primary transcript]] measures about 2,400 [[kilobase]]s and takes 16 hours to transcribe;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tennyson CN, Klamut HJ, Worton RG |title=The human dystrophin gene requires 16 hours to be transcribed and is cotranscriptionally spliced |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=184–90 |year=1995 |pmid= 7719347  |doi=10.1038/ng0295-184}}</ref> the mature [[mRNA]] measures 14.0 kilobases.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?val=NM_000109.2 NCBI Sequence Viewer v2.0<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The 79 [[exons]]<ref>Strachan T and Read AP, 1999.

==Function==
Dystrophin is a protein located between the [[sarcolemma]] and the outermost layer of [[myofilament]]s in the muscle fiber ([[myofiber]]). It is a cohesive protein, linking [[actin]] filaments to another support protein that resides on the inside surface of each muscle fiber’s plasma membrane (sarcolemma). This support protein on the inside surface of the sarcolemma in turn links to two other consecutive proteins for a total of three linking proteins. The final linking protein is attached to the fibrous [[endomysium]] of the entire muscle fiber. Dystrophin supports muscle fiber strength and helps to prevent muscle fiber injury. Movement of thin filaments (actin) creates a pulling force on the extracellular connective tissue that eventually becomes the tendon of the muscle.

==Pathology==
Dystrophin deficiency has been definitively established as one of the root causes of the general class of [[myopathy|myopathies]]  collectively referred to as [[muscular dystrophy]]. The large [[cytosol]]ic protein was first identified in 1987 by [[Louis M. Kunkel]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hoffman E, Brown R, Kunkel L |title=Dystrophin: the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus |journal=Cell |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=919–28 |year=1987 |pmid=3319190 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(87)90579-4}}</ref> 
after the 1986 discovery of the mutated gene that causes [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]] (DMD)
.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Monaco A |title=Isolation of candidate cDNAs for portions of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene |journal=Nature |volume=323 |issue=6089 |pages=646–50 |year=1986 |pmid=3773991 |doi=10.1038/323646a0 |author-separator=, |author2=Neve R |author3=Colletti-Feener C |display-authors=3 |last4=Bertelson |first4=Corlee J. |last5=Kurnit |first5=David M. |last6=Kunkel |first6=Louis M.}}</ref> 

Normal skeletal muscle tissue contains only small amounts of dystrophin (about 0.002% of total muscle protein), but its absence (or abnormal expression) leads to the development of a severe and currently incurable constellation of symptoms most readily characterized by several aberrant intracellular signaling pathways that ultimately yield pronounced myofiber [[necrosis]] as well as progressive muscle weakness and fatigability. Most DMD patients become wheelchair-dependent early in life, and the gradual development of cardiac hypertrophy&mdash;a result of severe myocardial fibrosis&mdash;typically results in premature death in the first two or three decades of life.
[[Mutation]]s in the dystrophin gene that lead to the production of less defective, but still only partially functional dystrophin protein, result in a display of a much milder dystrophic phenotype in affected patients, resulting in the disease known as [[Becker's muscular dystrophy]] (BMD). In some cases the patient's phenotype is such that experts may decide differently on whether a patient should be diagnosed with DMD or BMD.
The theory currently most commonly used to predict whether a mutation will result in a DMD or BMD phenotype, is the reading frame rule.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aartsma-Rus A |title=Entries in the Leiden Duchenne muscular dystrophy mutation database: an overview of mutation types and paradoxical cases that confirm the reading-frame rule |journal=Muscle Nerve |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=135–44 |year=2006 |pmid=16770791 |doi=10.1002/mus.20586 |author-separator=, |display-authors=1 |last2=Van Deutekom |first2=Judith C.

Though its role in airway smooth muscle is not well established, recent research indicates that dystrophin along with other subunits of dystrophin glycoprotein complex is associated with phenotype maturation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sharma P |title=Expression of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex is a marker for human airway smooth muscle phenotype maturation |journal=Am.
