A '''birthmark''' is a [[benignity|benign]] irregularity on the [[Human skin|skin]] which is present at birth or appears shortly after birth, usually in the first month. They can occur anywhere on the skin.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000012925|birthmark}}</ref> Birthmarks are caused by overgrowth of [[blood vessel]]s, [[melanocyte]]s, [[smooth muscle]], [[fat]], [[fibroblast]]s, or [[keratinocyte]]s.

[[Dermatologist]]s divide birthmarks into two types. Pigmented birthmarks caused by excess [[skin pigment]] cells include [[Melanocytic nevus|mole]]s, [[café-au-lait spot]]s, and [[Mongolian spots]]. Vascular birthmarks (also called red birthmarks) are caused by increased blood vessels and include [[macular stain]]s (salmon patches), [[hemangioma]]s, and [[Port-wine stain]]s. A little over 1 in 10 babies have a [[vascular]] birthmark present by age 1.<ref name="add.org">{{Cite web

==Pigmented types==
===Mole (Congenital melanocytic nevus)===
{{Main|Congenital melanocytic nevus}}
[[Congenital melanocytic nevus]] is a type of [[melanocytic nevus]] (or mole) found in [[infant]]s at [[birth]]. Occurring in about 1% of infants in the [[United States]], it is located in the area of the [[Human head|head]] and [[neck]] 15% of the time, but may occur anywhere on the body. It may appear as light brown in fair-skinned people, to almost black in darker-skinned people. Coming in a variety of sizes and appearances, they may be irregular in shape and flat, or raised and lumpy in appearance and feel.

===Café au lait spot===
{{Main|Café au lait spot}}
Café au lait spot [[macule]]s may occur anywhere on the body. They are most commonly oval in shape and light brown, or milk coffee, in color. These birthmarks may be present at birth, or appear in early childhood, and do not fade much with age.<ref name=parenting_child_health/> One or two on an individual is common;<ref name=parenting_child_health/> however, four or more may be an indicator of [[neurofibromatosis]].<ref name=parenting_child_health/>

===Mongolian spot (Dermal melanocytosis)===
{{Main|Mongolian spot}}
[[Image:Mongolianspotphoto.jpg|thumb|right|Mongolian spot visible on six-month-old baby]]A Mongolian blue spot is a [[benign]] flat [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] birthmark with wavy borders and irregular shape, most common among [[East Asia]]ns and [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] (excluding [[Turkish people]] of [[Asia Minor]]), and named after [[Mongolians]]. It is also extremely prevalent among [[East Africa]]ns and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].<ref name=tokyo>[http://www.tokyo-med.ac.jp/genet/msp/about.htm About Mongolian Spot]</ref><ref name=skin>[http://skin-care.health-cares.net/Mongolian-blue-spots.php Mongolian blue spots] - Health care guide discussing the Mongolian blue spot.</ref> Authentic Mongolian blue spots disappear within the first four years of life. The most common color is blue, although they can be blue-gray, blue-black or even deep brown.

The Mongolian spot is a [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] developmental condition exclusively involving the [[skin]]. The blue colour is caused by [[melanocyte]]s, [[melanin]]-containing cells, that are deep under the skin.<ref name=skin /> Usually, as multiple spots or one large patch, it covers one or more of the lumbosacral area (lower [[Human back|back]]), the [[buttock]]s, sides, and [[shoulder]]s.<ref name=skin /> It results from the entrapment of melanocytes in the [[dermis]] during their migration from the [[neural crest]] to the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] during [[embryo]]nic development.<ref name=skin />

Among those who are not aware of the background of the Mongolian spots, it may sometimes be mistaken for a bruise indicative of child abuse.<ref>[http://www.tokyo-med.ac.jp/genet/msp/index.htm Mongolian Spot] - English information of Mongolian spot, written by Hironao NUMABE, M.D., Tokyo Medical University.</ref>

==Vascular types==
===Stork bite (Nevus flammeus nuchae)===
{{Main|Nevus flammeus nuchae}}
[[File:Nevus flammeus nuchae ("stork bite" "Storchenbiss").JPG|thumb|Stork bite]]Colloquially called a "stork bite", "angel's kiss" or "salmon patch", [[telangiectatic nevus]] appears as a pink or tanned, flat, irregularly shaped mark on the knee, back of the neck, and/or the forehead, eyelids and, sometimes, the top lip. The skin is not thickened and feels no different from anywhere else on the body; the only difference remaining in appearance. Nearly half of all babies have such a birthmark.<ref name=parenting_child_health>{{Cite web

===Strawberry mark (Hemangioma)===
{{Main|Hemangioma}}
A '''hemangioma of infancy''' (strawberry mark) is a [[benign]] self-[[involution (medicine)|involuting]] [[tumor]] (swelling or growth) of [[endothelium|endothelial]] cells, the cells that line [[blood vessel]]s. It usually appears during the first weeks of life and resolves by age 10. In infancy, it is the most common tumor.<ref name="pmid16950977">{{cite journal |author=Haggstrom AN, Drolet BA, Baselga E, ''et al.'' |title=Prospective study of infantile hemangiomas: clinical characteristics predicting complications and treatment |journal=Pediatrics |volume=118 |issue=3 |pages=882–7 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16950977 |doi=10.1542/peds.2006-0413 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16950977}}</ref>

===Port-wine stain (Nevus flammeus)===
{{Main|Port-wine stain|l1=Nevus flammeus}}
[[Image:Gorbatschow DR-Forum 129 b2.jpg|thumb|right|Port-wine stain visible on the head of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], one of the most famous individuals with such a birthmark]]Port-wine stains, sometimes mistaken for strawberry marks, are present at birth and range from a pale pink in color, to a deep wine-red. Irregular in appearance, they are usually quite large, and caused by a deficiency or absence in the nerve supply to blood vessels. This causes the blood vessels to dilate, and blood to pool or collect in the affected area.<ref name=vascular_port>{{Cite web
|url=http://www.birthmark.org/port_wine_stains.php
|title=Port Wine Stain Information
|accessdate=2008-08-02
|publisher=[[Vascular Birthmark Foundation]]}}</ref> Over time, port-wine stains may become thick or develop small ridges or bumps, and do not fade with age.<ref name=add.org/> Such birthmarks may have emotional or social repercussions.<ref name=add.org/>

Port-wine stains occur in 0.3% of the population, equally among males and females.<ref name=add.org/><ref name=vascular_port/> They frequently express unilaterally, i.e., on only one side, not crossing the midline of the body. Often on the face, marks on the upper eyelid or forehead may be indicative of a condition called [[Sturge-Weber syndrome]]. Additionally, port-wine stains in these locations may be associated with [[glaucoma]] and [[seizure]]s.<ref name=add.org/>

==Treatment==
Most birthmarks are harmless and do not require treatment. Pigmented marks can resolve on their own over time in some cases. Vascular birthmarks may require reduction or removal for [[cosmesis|cosmetic]] reasons. Treatments include administering oral or injected [[steroid]]s, [[laser medicine|dermatological lasers]] to reduce size and/or color, or [[dermatologic surgery]].

==Folklore==
Birthmarks are called ''voglie'' in Italian, ''antojos'' in Spanish, and ''wiham'' in [[Arabic]]; all of which translate to "[[wish]]es" because, according to [[folklore]], they are caused by unsatisfied wishes of the mother during [[pregnancy]]. For example, if a pregnant woman does not satisfy a sudden wish or craving for [[strawberry|strawberries]], it's said that the infant might bear a strawberry mark.

In Dutch, birthmarks are called ''moedervlekken'', in Danish ''modermærke'' and in German ''Muttermal'' (mother-spots) because it was thought that an infant inherited the marks solely from the mother. The Hungarian word for any flat mole (as opposed to only congenital birthmarks), ''anyajegy'', is also derived from this belief.

Some [[myth]]s associated with birthmarks are that they are caused when an expectant mother sees something strange, or experiences a great deal of fear, sometimes called a  [[maternal impression]].<ref name=parenting_child_health/> 

In Iranian folklore, a birthmark appears when the pregnant mother touches a part of her body during a solar eclipse.

According to American folklore, birth marks sometimes indicate the site of traumatic injuries in a past life.<ref>{{cite book|author=B.
