The name scrapie is derived from one of the clinical signs of the condition, wherein affected animals will compulsively scrape off their fleeces against rocks, trees or fences.  The disease apparently causes an itching sensation in the animals.  Other clinical signs include excessive [[lip smacking]], altered [[gait]]s, and convulsive collapse.<ref name="pmid11258721">{{cite journal

Scrapie is infectious and transmissible among similar animals, so one of the most common ways to contain it (since it is incurable) is to quarantine and destroy those affected. However, scrapie tends to persist in flocks and can also arise apparently spontaneously in flocks that have not previously had cases of the disease. The mechanism of transmission between animals and other aspects of the biology of the disease are only poorly understood and these are active areas of research. Recent studies suggest prions may be spread through urine and persist in the environment for decades.<ref name="pmid12793776">{{cite journal

Scrapie usually affects sheep around three to five years of age. There appears to be the potential for transmission at birth and from contact with placental tissues. There is no evidence that scrapie is infectious to humans.<ref name="WikiVet">[http://en.wikivet.net/Scrapie Scrapie] reviewed and published by [[WikiVet]], accessed 12 October 2011.</ref>

==Uptake of prions==
[[Image:Scrapie lymph node immunoglobulin labeling.png|thumb|[[Lymph node]]s from (a) healthy and (b) infected sheep - colouring with antibodies shows clear sign of scrapie prions in the intracellular tissue of the infected sheep.]] The protein enters through the intestines or through cuts in the skin. The prions cause normal proteins of the sheep to fold into the wrong shape. These proteins are gradually accumulated in the body, especially in nerve cells, which subsequently die. When the prions are absorbed through the intestines, they first appear in the lymph nodes, especially in [[Peyer's patches]] at the [[small intestine]].<ref>[http://www.forskning.no/artikler/2008/juni/186400 Tarmen viktig for skrapesyke - forskning.no]</ref>

An experiment has shown lambs risk being infected through milk from infected ewes,<ref>Konold, Moore, Bellworthy, Simmons, "Evidence of scrapie transmission via milk", BMC Veterinary Research 2008, 4:16 {{doi|10.1186/1746-6148-4-16}}</ref> but the lambs in the experiment also infected each other, making it difficult to assess the risk of infection. The experiment did not continue long enough to show that the lambs developed symptoms, but merely that the prion was present in their bodies.

==Clinical signs and diagnosis==
Changes are mild at first; there may be slight behavioural changes and maybe an increase in chewing movements. Ataxia and neurological signs then develop, and affected sheep struggle to keep up with the flock.<ref name="WikiVet"/>

Some sheep scratch excessively and will show patches of wool loss and lesions on the skin. Scratching sheep over the rump area may lead to a nibbling reflex which is pathognomonic (characteristic for a particular disease) for the condition.<ref name="WikiVet"/>

Signs of a chronic systemic disease appear later, with weight loss, anorexia, lethargy and possibly death.<ref name="WikiVet"/>

''Post mortem'' examination is important for the diagnosis of scrapie. Histology of tissues will show accumulation of [[prion]] in the central nervous system, and immunohistochemical staining and [[ELISA]] can also be used to demonstrate the protein.

==Treatment and preventive action==
No treatment is available for affected sheep.<ref name="WikiVet"/>

In the [[United Kingdom]], the government has put in place a National Scrapie Plan, which encourages breeding from sheep that are genetically more resistant to scrapie. This is intended to eventually reduce the incidence of the disease in the UK sheep population. Scrapie occurs in [[Europe]] and [[North America]], but to date, [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] (both major sheep-producing countries) are scrapie-free. 

Breeds such as [[Cheviot sheep|Cheviot]] and [[suffolk (sheep)|Suffolk]] are more susceptible to scrapie than other breeds.<ref name=Straiton>Eddie Straiton, "Sheep Ailments - recognition and treatment", 7th edition (2001) ISBN 1-86126-397-X</ref> Specifically, this is determined by the genes coding for the naturally occurring prion proteins. The most resistant sheep have a double set of "ARR" [[allele]]s, while sheep with the "VRQ" allele are the most susceptible.<ref name=Helse>Synnøve Vatn, Lisbeth Hektoen, Ola Nafstad "Helse og Velferd hos sau" 1. utgave, Tun Forlag (2008) ISBN 978-82-529-3180-8</ref> A simple blood test reveals the allele of the sheep, and many countries are actively breeding away the VRQ allele.

In 2010, A team from New York described detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> even when initially present at only one part in a hundred thousand million (10<sup>−11</sup>) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called [[Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA)]] and some specific antibodies against PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a microcapillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus so it is totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser. The technique allowed detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> after many fewer cycles of conversion than others have achieved, substantially reducing the possibility of artefacts, as well as speeding up the assay. The researchers also tested their method on blood samples from apparently healthy sheep that went on to develop scrapie. The animals’ brains were analysed once any symptoms became apparent. The researchers could therefore compare results from brain tissue and blood taken once the animals exhibited symptoms of the diseases, with blood obtained earlier in the animals’ lives, and from uninfected animals. The results showed very clearly that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> could be detected in the blood of animals long before the symptoms appeared. After further development and testing, this method could be of 
great value in surveillance as a blood- or urine-based screening test for scrapie.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Detecting Prions in Blood |journal=Microbiology Today. |pages=195 |year=2010 |month=August |url= https://www.sgm.ac.uk/pubs/micro_today/pdf/081010.pdf |accessdate=2011-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bionosis.com/news/Bionosis%20PrioNet%20Poster.pdf | title = SOFIA: An Assay Platform for Ultrasensitive Detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in Brain and Blood | publisher =  SUNY Downstate Medical Center | authorlink = Rubenstein, R., et al. | accessdate = 2011-08-19}}</ref>

==Transmission/exposure pathways==
Various studies have indicated prions (PrP<sup>SC</sup>) that infect sheep and goats with the fatal
transmissible [[encephalopathy]] known as scrapie, are able to persist in soil
for years without losing their pathogenic activity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Saunders|first=Samuel E.|coauthors=Shannon L. Bartelt-Hunt, and Jason C. Bartz|title=Prions in the environment|journal=Prion|year=2008|month=Oct/Nov/Dec|volume=2|issue=4|pages=162–169}}</ref>  Dissemination of prions into the environment can occur from several sources: mainly, infectious placenta or amniotic fluid of sheep and possibly environmental contamination by saliva or excrement.

Confirmatory tesing for scrapie can only be achieved by  applying [[immunohistochemistry]] (IHC) of disease-associated prion protein (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) to tissues collected ''post mortem'', including [[obex]], [[retropharyngeal lymph node]] and [[palatine tonsil]]. A live animal diagnostic, not confirmatory,  test was approved in 2008 for immunochemistry testing on rectal biopsy-derived lymphoid tissue by USDA.

Natural [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]] of scrapie in the field seems to occur via the alimentary tract in the
majority of cases, and scrapie-free sheep flocks can become infected on pastures where
outbreaks of scrapie had been observed before. These findings point to a sustained contagion
in the environment, and notably the soil.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Seidel|first=Bjoern|coauthors=Thomzig A, Buschmann A, Groschup M, Peters R, Beekes M, Terytze K|title=Scrapie Agent (Strain 263K) Can Transmit Disease via the Oral Route after Persistence in Soil Over Years|journal=[[PLoS ONE]]|date=9th|year=2007|month=May|issue=5}}</ref>

Prion concentration in birth fluids does not alter the [[infectivity]] of the prions. Even when
placentas have little PrPS<sup>C</sup>, kids born to naturally or experimentally infected does become
infected themselves. PrP<sup>SC</sup> is shed at a higher percent, 52%- 72% in sheep placentas, than goat
placenta at 5-10% in study trials at the USDA Agricultural Research Service.<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Rourke|first=Catherine|title=PP - USDA ARS}}</ref>
  
Fecal concentration of PrP<sup>SC</sup> has been reported in the [[feces]] of sheep both in
the terminal and the early preclinical stages of the disease, suggesting the prions are likely
to be shed into the environment throughout the [[pathogenesis]]. Several sources of prions in
feces could be postulated, including environmental ingestion and swallowing infected saliva;
however, the most likely source is shedding from the gut-associated [[lymphoid system#Lymphoid tissue|lymphoid tissue]]. 
Ruminants have specialized [[Peyer's patch]]es that throughout the length of the [[ileum]] amount
to approximately 100,000 follicles, and all of these could be infected and shedding prions into
the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Terry|first=Linda|coauthors=et al|title=Detection of Prions in the faeces of sheep naturally infected with classical scrapie|journal=Veterinary Research|date=18|year=2011|month=May|volume=42|issue=65}}</ref>
Scrapie prions have been found in the Peyer's patches of naturally infected nonclinical lambs as young as four months of age.

===Exposure through contaminated soil===
Ingestion of soil by grazing sheep has been measured in two soil types, at two stocking rates
and over two grazing seasons. Animals ingested up to 44g soil per kg of body weight between
May and November. Rainfall and stocking rate emerged as factors influencing ingestion. The
effect of soil type and herbage on offer was less evident.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McGrath|first=D|coauthors=et al|title=Soil Ingestion by Grazing Sheep|journal=Irish Journal of Agriculture|year=1982}}</ref> 

The average weight of an adult sheep is approximately 250 pounds.<ref>{{cite web|last=USDA|first=National Statistical Service|title=Livestock Slaughter 2010}}</ref> If an adult sheep ate 400g/kg of soil
as predicted by D. McGrath ''et al.'', then the average sheep would ingest approximately 45,000 g over
six months, or 251 g per day. Assuming the soil was contaminated with prions (PrP<sup>SC</sup>) from feces
or birth fluids, then potentially the sheep would be infected. The concentration of the prions is
uncertain, and concentration is not directly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to infectivity.

Factors affecting prion infectivity in the soil have been shown to include the length of time in the soil and the binding abilities of the soil.

For a detailed [[risk assessment]] of scrapie-contaminated soil, it was of major importance to analyze whether the detectable PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in the soil extracts still exhibited oral infectivity after incubation times up to 29 months. A [[bioassay]] with [[Golden hamster|Syrian hamsters]] was performed by feeding the animals with contaminated soil or [[aqueous solution|aqueous]] soil extracts that had been collected after soil incubation for 26 and 29 months, respectively. Hamsters fed with contaminated soil exhibited first scrapie-associated symptoms at 2 weeks to 6 months (95% CI) after the first application. The hamsters
reached the terminal stage of scrapie at 5 to 21 months (95% CI) after the first feeding. This indicated substantial amounts of persistent infectivity in soil that had been incubated for 26 and 29 months.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Seidel|first=Bjoern|coauthors=Thomzig A, Buschmann A, Groschup M, Peters R, Beekes M, Terytze K|title=Scrapie Agent (Strain 263K) Can Transmit Disease via the Oral Route after Persistence in Soil Over Years|journal=PLoS ONE|date=9th|year=2007|month=May|issue=5}}</ref> In Iceland in 1978, a program was implemented to eradicate scrapie, and affected flocks were [[culling|culled]], premises were disinfected, sheep houses were burnt; after two to three years, the premises were restocked with lambs from scrapie-free areas. Between 1978 and 2004, scrapie recurred on 33 farms. 
Nine recurrences occurred 14–21 years after culling as a result of environmental contamination.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Georgsson|first=Gudmundu|coauthors=et al|title=Infectious agent of sheep scrapie may persist in the environment for at least 16 years|journal=Journal of General Virology|year=2006}}</ref>

The binding abilities of different soil types have been shown to enhance disease penetrance. Soil containing the common clay mineral [[montmorillonite]] (Mte) and [[kaolinite]] (Kte) binds more effectively with the prions than soil containing [[quartz]].<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Rourke|first=Katherine|title=USDA-ARS 2011}}</ref> Enhanced transmissibility of soil-bound prions may explain the environmental spread of scrapie despite low levels shed into the environment. The mechanism by which Mte or other soil components enhances the transmissibility of particle bound prions remains to be clarified.
Prion binding to Mte or other soil components may partially protect PrP<sup>SC</sup> from [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] or [[proteolysis]] in the digestive tract, allowing more disease agent to be taken up from the
gut. Adsorption of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> soil may alter aggregation state of the protein, shifting the size distribution toward more infectious prion protein particles, thereby increasing the infectious units. For prion disease to be transmitted via ingestion of prion contaminated soil, prions must also remain infectious by the oral route of exposure. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin investigated the oral infectivity of Mte and soil-bound prions. The effects of prion source (via infected brain homogenate and purified PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) and dose on penetrance (proportion of animals eventually exhibiting clinical signs of scrapie) and incubation period (time to onset of clinical symptoms) was evaluated. Approximately 38% of animals receiving 200&nbsp;ng of unbound, clarified PrP<sup>Sc</sup> orally exhibited clinical symptoms, with an incubation period for infected animals of 203 to 633 days. In contrast, all animals orally dosed with an equivalent amount of Mte-bound PrP<sup>Sc</sup> manifested disease symptoms in 195 to 637 days. Animals orally receiving Mte soil alone or one-tenth as much unbound clarified PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (20&nbsp;ng) remained asymptomatic throughout the course of the experiment.  These data established that Mte-bound prions remain infectious via the oral route of exposure, but that the agent binding Mte increases disease penetrance, enhancing the efficiency of oral transmission.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pederson|first=Joel|coauthors=et al|title=Oral transmissibility of prion disease is enhanced by binding to soil particles|journal=Plos Pathog|year=2007|month=July}}</ref>

===Transmission summary===
Prions (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) are shed from sheep and goats in birth fluids, feces and other excrement. The concentration of the prions is uncertain, but is not directly proportional to infectivity. Sheep ingest soil, so soil represents a plausible environmental reservoir of scrapie, which can persist in the environment for years. Longevity of the prions and the attachment of
soil particles likely influences the persistence and infectivity of prions in the environment.

Effective methods to inactivate prions in the soil are currently lacking, and the effects of natural degradation mechanisms on prion infectivity are largely unknown. An improved understanding of the processes affecting the mobility, persistence and [[bioavailability]] of prions in soil is needed for the management of prion-contaminated environments. A system for estimating the prion-binding capacity of soil on farms using simple soil analysis may allow an estimate of the prion risk in the environment, and whether prion binding by the use of soil amendments or top dressings may help to mitigate the infectious prions. [[Lichens]], ''[[Lobaria pulmonaria]]'', may have potential for reducing the number of prions because some species contain  [[protease]]s that show promise in breaking down the prion. Further work to clone and characterize the proteases, assess their effects on prion infectivity, and determine which organism or organisms present in lichens produce or influence the protease activity is warranted and is currently under investigation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=CJ|coauthors=et al|title=Degradation of the disease-associated prion protein by a serine protease from lichens|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2011}}</ref>
