'''Myelolipoma''' (''myelo-'', from the [[ancient greek]] ''μυελός'', '''marrow'''; ''lipo'', meaning ''of, or pertaining to, '''fat'''''; ''-oma'', meaning '''''[[tumor]]''' or '''mass''''') is a [[benign]] tumor-like [[lesion]] composed of mature [[adipose]] (fat) tissue and [[haematopoiesis|haematopoietic]] (blood-forming) elements in various proportions.<ref name=Thompson06>{{cite book |author=Thompson, LDR |title=Endocrine Pathology |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-443-06685-6 |series=Foundations in Diagnostic Pathology}}</ref>

==Causes==
Although several [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] have been proposed as to the cause of myelolipoma, the causative process is still not clearly understood.<ref name = McNicol>{{cite journal |author=McNicol AM |title=A diagnostic approach to adrenal cortical lesions |journal=Endocr Pathol |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=241–251 |date=Winter 2008 |pmid=19089656 |doi=10.1007/s12022-008-9055-x}}</ref>  Recent experimental evidence suggests that both the myeloid and lipomatous elements have a [[monoclonal]] origin, which strongly supports the hypothesis that myelolipomas are [[neoplastic]] lesions.<ref name=McNicol/>

Older theories proposing a non-neoplastic origin include the following:
* [[Adrenal cortex|Adrenal cortical]] cells, or other cells within the [[stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]] of the adrenal cortex that are able to [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]],  may [[metaplasia|reversibly change]] into fat or blood-forming cells.  This might occur because of the actions of [[Adrenal_cortex#Production|adrenal cortex hormones]], or of hormones released by the [[pituitary gland]] that act on the adrenal glands, such as [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH).<ref name=Olobatuyi06>{{cite journal |author=Olobatuyi FA, Maclennan GT |title=Myelolipoma |journal=J Urol |volume=176 |issue=3 |page=1188 |date=September 2006 |pmid=16890722 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-5347(06)01542-4}}</ref>
* The blood-forming cells may arise by differentiation of cells within the [[blood vessels|capillaries]] of the adrenal gland.<ref name="Ramchandani, P 2007">Ramchandani, P. {{EMedicine|article|376700|Adrenal Myelolipoma Imaging}}</ref>
* Myelolipoma simply represents a site of normal blood formation outside the [[bone marrow]].<ref name="Ramchandani, P 2007"/>

==Epidemiology==
Myelolipomas are rare. They have been reported to be found unexpectedly at [[autopsy]] in 0.08% to 0.4% of cases (''i.e.:'' somewhere between 8 per 10,000 and 4 per 1,000 autopsies). They most commonly occur in the adrenal gland, yet only comprise about 3% of all adrenal tumours.  They may also occur in other sites, such as the [[mediastinum]], the [[liver]] and the [[gastrointestinal tract]].<ref name=Thompson06/>

There is no gender predilection, males and females are affected equally. The peak age range at diagnosis is between 40 and 79 years of age.<ref name=Thompson06/>

==Symptoms and signs==
The majority of myelolipomas are [[asymptomatic]]. Most do not produce any adrenal hormones. Most are only discovered as a result of investigation for another problem.<ref name="Ramchandani, P 2007"/>

When myelolipomas do produce symptoms, it is usually because they have become large, and are pressing on other organs or tissues nearby. Symptoms include pain in the [[human abdomen|abdomen]] or [[wiktionary:flank#Noun|flank]], [[haematuria|blood in the urine]], a [[palpate|palpable]] lump or [[hypertension|high blood pressure]].<ref name=Thompson06/>

As they are benign tumors, myelolipomas do not [[metastasis|spread to other body parts]].  Larger myelolipomas are at risk of [[necrosis|localised tissue death]] and bleeding, which may cause a [[retroperitoneum|retroperitoneal]] [[haemorrhage]].<ref name=Thompson06/>

==Medical investigation==
[[Image:Myelolipom der Nebenniere CT.jpg|thumb|Myeloplipoma shown on a CT scan image]]
Most myelolipomas are unexpected findings on [[CT scan]]s and [[MRI]] scans of the abdomen.  They may sometimes be seen on a plain [[radiography|X-ray]] films.<ref name="Ramchandani, P 2007"/>

[[FNA|Fine needle aspiration]] may be performed to obtain cells for [[cytopathology|microscopic diagnosis]].<ref name=Thompson06/>

==Treatment==
Small myelolipomas generally do not produce symptoms, and do not require treatment.  Ongoing surveillance of these lesions by a doctor is recommended.  Surgical excision (removal) is recommended for large myelolipomas because of the risk of bleeding complications.<ref name=Olobatuyi06/>

==Pathology==

===Macroscopic features===
Myelolipomas are usually found to occur alone in one adrenal gland, but not both.  They can vary widely in size, from as small as a few millimetres to as large as 34 centimeters in diameter.  The cut surface has colours varying from yellow to red to mahogany brown, depending on the distribution of fat, blood, and blood-forming cells.  The cut surface of larger myelolipomas may contain haemorrhage or [[infarction]].<ref name=Thompson06/>

===Microscopic features===
[[Image:myelolipoma histology HE.jpg|thumb|The microscopic view of a myelolipoma shows the presence of normal adrenal cells, fat (adipose) cells, and the three lineages of the myeloid precursors]]
The typical microscopic features of myelolipomas are shown in the image.  There is a mixture of normal adrenal tissue, fat, and a full trilineage maturation of the three major [[haematopoiesis|blood-forming]] elements: [[myeloid]] (white blood cell forming), [[erythroid]] (red blood cell forming), and [[megakaryocyte|megakaryocytic]] (platelet forming) lines.<ref name=Thompson06/>
