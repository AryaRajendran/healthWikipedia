Under the oppressive Imperial Japanese government, citizens were expected to contribute in one way or another to the war effort, and the mentally ill were unable to do so, and as such were looked down upon and abused. The main cause of death for these patients was starvation, as caretakers did to supply the patients with adequate food, likely as a form of torture and a method of sedation. Because mentally ill patients were kept secluded from the outside world, the large number of deaths went unnoticed by the general public. After the end of Allied occupation, the [[Diet of Japan|National Diet of Japan]] passed the {{nihongo|Mental Hygiene Act|精神衛生法,|Seishin Eisei Hō}} in 1950, which improved the status of the mentally ill and prohibited the domestic containment of mental patients in medical institutions. However, the Mental Hygiene Act had unforeseen consequences. Along with many other reforms, the law prevented the mentally ill from being charged with any sort of crime in Japanese courts. Anyone who was found to be mentally unstable by a qualified psychiatrist was required to be hospitalized rather than incarcerated, regardless of the severity of any crime that person may have committed. The Ministry of Justice tried several times to amend the law, but was met with opposition from those who believed the legal system should not interfere with medical science.<ref name="Totsuka"/> After almost four decades, the {{nihongo|Mental Health Act|精神保健法,|Seishin Hoken Hō}} was finally passed in 1987. The new law corrected the flaws of the Mental Hygiene Act by allowing the Ministry of Health and Welfare to set regulations on the treatment of mental patients in both medical and legal settings. With the new law, the mentally ill have the right to voluntary hospitalization, the ability to be charged with a crime, and right to use the insanity defense in court, and the right to pursue legal action in the event of abuse or negligence on the part of medical professionals.

Although Cuba has been politically connected to the Soviet Union since the United States broke off relations with Cuba shortly after the president [[Fidel Castro]] came to power in 1959, few considerable allegations regarding the political abuse of psychiatry in this country emerged before the late 1980s.<ref name="Medicine betrayed"/>{{rp|74}} [[Americas Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]] published reports alluding to cases of possible unwarranted hospitalization and ill-treatment of political prisoners.<ref name="Medicine betrayed"/>{{rp|75}} These reports concerned the Gustavo Machin hospital in [[Santiago de Cuba]] in the southeast of the country and the major mental hospital in [[Havana]].<ref name="Medicine betrayed"/>{{rp|75}} In 1977, a report on alleged abuse of psychiatry in Cuba presenting cases of ill-treatment in mental hospitals going back to the 1970s came out in the United States.<ref name="Medicine betrayed"/>{{rp|75}} It presents grave allegations that prisoners end up in the forensic ward of mental hospitals in Santiago de Cuba and Havana where they undergo ill-treatment including [[electroconvulsive therapy]] without  [[muscle relaxants]] or [[anaesthesia]].<ref name="Medicine betrayed"/>{{rp|75}} The reported application of ECT in the forensic wards seems, at least in many of the cited cases, not to be an adequate clinical treatment for the diagnosed state of the prisoner&nbsp;— in some cases the prisoners seem not to have been diagnosed at all.<ref name="Medicine betrayed"/>{{rp|75}} Conditions in the forensic wards have been described in repulsive terms and apparently are in striking contrast to the other parts of the mental hospitals that are said to be well-kept and modern.<ref name="Medicine betrayed"/>{{rp|75}}

Chinese official psychiatric literature testifies distinctly that the Communist Party's notion of ‘political dangerousness’ was long since institutionally engrafted in the diagnostic armory of China's psychiatry and included in the main concept of psychiatric dangerousness.<ref name="Munro"/>{{rp|4}}

The People’s Republic of China is the only country which appears to abuse psychiatry for political purposes in a systematic way, and despite international criticism, this seems to be continuing.<ref name="van Voren 2010"/> Political abuse of psychiatry in the People’s Republic of China is high on the agenda and has produced recurring disputes in the international psychiatric community.<ref name="van Voren 2010"/> The abuses there appear to be even more widespread than in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s and involve the incarceration of ‘petitioners’, human rights workers, trade union activists, followers of the Falun Gong movement, and people complaining against injustices by local authorities.<ref name="van Voren 2010"/>

It also seemed that, China had hardly known high security forensic institutions until 1989.<ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|243}} However, since then, the Chinese authorities have constructed the entire network of special forensic mental hospitals called ''Ankang'' which in Chinese is for ‘Peace and Health.’<ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|243}} By that time, China had had 20 Ankang institutions with the staff employed by the Ministry of State Security.<ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|243}} The psychiatrists who worked there were wearing uniforms under their white coats.<ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|243}}

The political abuse of psychiatry in China seems to take place only in the institutions under the authority of the police and the Ministry of State Security but not in those belonging to other governmental sectors.<ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|243}} Psychiatric care in China falls into four sectors that hardly connect up with each other.<ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|243}} These are Ankang institutions of the Ministry of State Security; those belonging to the police; those that fall under the authority of the Ministry of Social Affairs; those belonging to the Ministry of Health.<ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|243}} Both the sectors belonging to the police and the Ministry of State Security are the closed sectors, and, consequently, information hardly ever leaks out.<ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|243}} In the hospitals belonging to the Ministry of Health, psychiatrists do not contact with the Ankang institutions and, actually, had no idea of what occurred there, and could, thereby, sincerely state that they were not informed of political abuse of psychiatry in China.<ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|243}}

In China, the structure of forensic psychiatry was to a great extent identical to that in the USSR.<ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|243}} On its own, it is not so strange, since psychiatrists of the [[Moscow Serbsky Institute]] visited [[Beijing]] in 1957 to help their Chinese ‘brethren’, the same psychiatrists who promoted the system of political abuse of psychiatry in their own USSR.<ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|243}} As a consequence, diagnostics were not much different than in the Soviet Union.<ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|244}} The only difference was that the Soviets preferred ‘[[sluggish schizophrenia]]’ as a diagnosis, and the Chinese generally cleaved to the diagnosis ‘[[paranoia]]’ or ‘[[paranoid schizophrenia]]’.<ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|244}} However, the results were the same: long hospitalization in a mental hospital, involuntary treatment with [[neuroleptics]], torture, abuse, all aimed at breaking the victim’s will.<ref name="van Voren 2009"/>{{rp|244}}

It was reported in June, 2012, that the [[Indian Government]] has approached [[NIMHANS]], a well known metal health establishment in [[South India]], to assist in suppressing anti-nuclear protests regards to building of the [[Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant]]. The government was in talks with NIMHANS representatives to chalk up a plan to dispatch psychiatrists to [[Kudankulam]], for counselling protesters opposed to the building of the plant. To fulfill this, [[NIMHANS]] developed a team of 6 members, all of them, from the Department of Social Psychiatry.

Reports on particular cases continue to come from Russia where the worsening political climate appears to make an atmosphere in which local authorities feel able to again use psychiatry as a means of frightening.<ref name="van Voren 2010"/> In modern Russia, the fact that a person is a human rights defender again means that the person risks receiving a psychiatric diagnosis.<ref name="15 лет НПЖ">{{ru icon}} {{cite journal|title=15 лет Независимому психиатрическому журналу|journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]|year=2005|issue=№ 4|url=http://www.npar.ru/journal/2005/4/15years.htm|accessdate=24 July 2011|issn=1028-8554}}</ref>

In the 1970s, [[Martha Beall Mitchell]], wife of U.S. Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]], was diagnosed with a paranoid mental disorder for claiming that the administration of President [[Richard M. Nixon]] was engaged in illegal activities. Many of her claims were later proved correct, and the term "[[Martha Mitchell effect]]" was coined to describe mental health misdiagnoses when accurate claims are dismissed as delusional.

In 2006, Canadian psychiatrist Colin A. Ross's book was published, titled ''The C.I.A. Doctors: Human Rights Violations by American Psychiatrists''.<ref name="Ross">{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Colin|title=The C.I.A.

In 2010, the book ''[[The Protest Psychosis: How Schizophrenia Became a Black Disease]]'' by [[psychiatrist]]  Jonathan Metzl (who also has a Ph.D. in [[American studies]]) was published.<ref name="Metzl"/> The book covers the history of the 1960s [[Ionia State Hospital]] located in [[Ionia, Michigan]] and now converted to a prison and focuses on exposing the trend of this hospital to diagnose [[African American]]s with [[schizophrenia]] because of their [[civil rights]] ideas.<ref name="Metzl"/> The book suggests that in part the sudden influx of such diagnoses could traced to a change in wording in the [[DSM-II]], which compared to the previous edition added "hostility" and "aggression" as signs of the disorder.<ref name="Metzl"/>

== Psychiatric reprisals ==
[[Whistleblower|Whistle-blowers]] who part ranks with a government agency or major corporation can expect to be depicted as unhinged; it's in the agency's best interests. For example, [[Russ Tice]] was punished with psychiatric evaluations that labeled him as "mentally unbalanced" after persisting in his investigations of potentially illegal spying activity at the NSA.<ref>[http://www.slate.com/id/2134398 The Professional Paranoid: Why NSA whistle-blower Russ Tice may be right]</ref>  As another example, an NYPD veteran who alleged falsified crime statistics in his department was forcibly committed to a mental institution.<ref>[http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2010/10/cop-nypd-psych-ward-whistleblowing/ Cop hauled off to psych ward after alleging fake crime stats]</ref>
