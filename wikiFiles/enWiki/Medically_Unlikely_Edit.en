A '''Medically Unlikely Edit''' (MUE) is a [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|Medicare]] unit of service [[Claim (medical)|claim edit]] applied to [[Medical billing (United States)|Medical claims]] against a [[Procedure codes|procedure code]] for medical services rendered by one [[Health care provider|provider/supplier]] to one [[patient]] on one day. Claim edits compare different values on medical claim to a set of defined criteria to check for irregularities, often in an automated claims processing system. MUE are designed to limit fraud and/or coding errors. They represent an upper limit that unquestionably requires further documentation to support.  The ideal MUE is the maximum unit of service for a code on the majority of medical claims.<ref Name=" Q8734">{{cite web
