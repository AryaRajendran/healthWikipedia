'''Fioricet''' and '''Esgic''' are brand names of a combination of [[butalbital]] (a [[barbiturate]], 50&nbsp;mg), [[acetaminophen]] (325&nbsp;mg) and [[caffeine]] (40&nbsp;mg) which is indicated for the treatment of [[tension headaches]], [[muscle contraction headaches]] and post-dural puncture headaches.  Although not indicated, they are commonly used to treat [[migraines]] and other [[pain]] related ailments. 

==Usage and dosage==
Fioricet is indicated for the treatment of complex and [[muscle contraction headaches]].  It is also commonly prescribed for migraines although it is not [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] indicated for this use in the United States.  The usual adult dose is 1-2 tablets every four hours as needed, not exceeding six tablets in a 24 hour period.<ref>[http://www.rxlist.com/fioricet-drug.htm Fioricet at RxList]</ref><ref>http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/archives/fdaDrugInfo.cfm?archiveid=4417</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Butalbital has generalized depressant effect on [[central nervous system]] and, in very high doses, has peripheral effects. Acetaminophen has [[analgesic]] and [[antipyretic]] effects; its analgesic effects may be mediated through inhibition of [[prostaglandin]] synthetase enzyme complex. Caffeine is thought to produce constriction of [[brain|cerebral]] [[blood vessels]].

Butalbital has a half-life of about 35 hours. Acetaminophen has a half-life of about 1.25 to 3 hours, but may be increased by liver damage and after an overdose. Caffeine has a half-life of about 5 to 7 hours.<ref>http://www.webmd.com/balance/caffeine-myths-and-facts</ref>
