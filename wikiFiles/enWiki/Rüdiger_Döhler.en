'''Rüdiger Döhler FRCSEd'''  (August 24, 1948 in Rochlitz, [[Saxony]]) is a [[Germans|German]] [[professor]] of [[orthopedic surgery]].

==Life==
Döhler grew up in Rochlitz and East Berlin.  In 1958, his family fled from the [[East Germany|GDR]] to Bremerhaven (then Port of Embarkation for the US troops in Germany).  After graduating from a classic-languages school he joined the [[German Navy]] and from 1968 through 1974 studied [[medicine]] in [[Kiel]] with a break in [[Hamburg]] and [[Heidelberg]].

He is married to  his second wife, Marlo Döhler (born Kröpelin). He has two daughters and a son from his first wife, Engel von Bülow.

===Clinical career===

In 1976, Döhler was awarded his doctoral degree at the '''[[University of Kiel]]'''. He was trained in [[pathology]] (L.-D. Leder, Essen), [[surgery]] (G. Heinemann, Minden) and [[orthopedics]] (W. Blauth, Kiel)  and achieved the acknowledgement as orthopedic surgeon in 1983.

In March 1984, he went to [[Edinburgh]] and did clinical work at the Princess Margaret Rose Orthopaedic Hospital and, with a grant of the ''Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft'' (German Research Council),  performed basic research at the [[University of Edinburgh]] ([[Sean P. F. Hughes]]).

In August 1985 he returned to Kiel, and three years later he moved to the [[University of Münster]] for spinal surgery  (H. H. Matthiass). In 1990, he quit cold orthopedics and re-embarked on (trauma) surgery in Hamburg-Altona.  There, he achieved his second acknowledgement as general surgeon (1992) and finished  his [[habilitation]] with the neuroanatomist Werner Lierse.

After German unification in 1995, he was appointed head  of the then new hospital in Plau am See, [[Mecklenburg]] (former GDR). His department was the first in [[Germany]] to officially combine hot and cold orthopedics, and the  first in [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] with a unit for hand surgery (from 1998).

Döhler operated on children from [[Africa]] and [[Central Asia]] for the ''Friedensdorf International'' and, on behalf of the ''Foundation Remembrance, Responsibility and Future'', on former Nazi slave laborers from Poland and Ukraine.

Döhler was made a Fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] without Examination in 1999. In academic terms, he was attached to the Berlin [[Charité]] (1996), and in January 2006 he was made a [[professor]] at the [[University of Greifswald]].

Since January 2008, he has been employed by the ''Berufsgenossenschaftliches Unfallkrankenhaus'' in Hamburg.

===Military===
For becoming a reserve officer Döhler joined the [[German Navy]] in October 1967. While studying medicine he had his military training in the Territorials{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}.  A staff surgeon since  1979, he also served frequent times in the German Navy. In 1993 he was promoted to his last rank, Surgeon Captain ([[Oberst|OF-5]]). In spring 1994 he was a distinguished visitor to  the [[National Naval Medical Center]] in Bethesda, Virginia. From 2003 to 2007 he was commander of a Reserves regiment.

===Other commitments===
From 1986 to 1990 Döhler was an honorary consultant to the  [[St John's Ambulance]] in [[Schleswig-Holstein]].

While living in Mecklenburg, Döhler was active as a classical [[pianist]] and appeared with another pianist, singers and orchestras. His ''Mecklenburger Ärztetrio'' (Mecklenburg Doctors Trio) was coached by a [[cellist]] from the [[Berlin Philharmonic]].

A member of the academic Corps Masovia, he has long been dealing with [[Königsberg]], the  former capital of [[East Prussia]], and has a special interest in academic [[fraternity|fraternities]].  In 2009 he was elected chairman of the association for corpsstudent historical research. In 2010 he became  an associate member of the ''Historical Commission for East and West Prussia''.
