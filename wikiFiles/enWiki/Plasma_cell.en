'''Plasma cells''', also called '''plasma B cells''', '''plasmocytes''', and '''effector B cells''', are [[white blood cells]] which secrete large volumes of [[antibodies]]. They are transported by the [[blood plasma]] and the [[lymphatic system]]. Like all blood cells, plasma cells ultimately originate in the [[bone marrow]]; however, these cells leave the bone marrow as [[B cells]], before terminal differentiation into plasma cells, normally in [[lymph nodes]].

== Development ==
After leaving the bone marrow, the B cell acts as an [[antigen presenting cell]] (APC) and internalizes offending [[antigens]]. That antigen is taken up by the B cell through [[receptor-mediated endocytosis]] and processed. Pieces of the pathogen (which are now known as ''antigenic peptides'') are loaded onto [[MHC II]] molecules, and presented on its extracellular surface to [[CD4+ T cells]] (sometimes called ''T helper cells''). These T cells bind to the MHC II/antigen molecule and cause activation of the B cell.
Upon stimulation by a T cell, which usually occurs in [[germinal center]]s of secondary [[Lymphoid_system#Lymphoid_tissue|lymphoid organs]] like the spleen and lymph nodes, the activated B cell begins to differentiate into more specialized cells. [[Germinal center]] B cells may differentiate into [[memory B cells]] or plasma cells. The mechanism by which a B cell becomes one or the other of these three is a process known as affinity maturation.<ref name="isbn0-12-053641-2">{{cite book |author=Neuberger, M. S.; Honjo, T.; Alt, Frederick W. |title=Molecular biology of B cells |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |year=2004 |pages=189–191 |isbn=0-12-053641-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Most of these B cells will become plasmablasts, and eventually plasma cells, and begin producing large volumes of antibodies.
== Immature plasma cells==
The most immature blood cell that is considered a plasma cell instead of a B cell is the '''plasmablast'''.<ref name="isbn0-7817-6507-2">{{cite book |author=Bertil Glader; Greer, John G.; John Foerster; Rodgers, George G.; Paraskevas, Frixos |title=Wintrobe's Clinical Hematology, 2-Vol. Set |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |pages=347 |isbn=0-7817-6507-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Plasmablasts secrete more antibodies than B cells, but less than plasma cells.<ref name="isbn0-8153-4123-7">{{cite book |author=Walport, Mark; Murphy, Kenneth; Janeway, Charles; Travers, Paul J. |title=Janeway's immunobiology |publisher=Garland Science |location=New York |year=2008 |pages=387–388 |isbn=0-8153-4123-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> They divide rapidly and are still capable of internalizing antigens and presenting them to T cells.<ref name="isbn0-8153-4123-7" /> A cell may stay in this state for several days, and then either die or irrevocably differentiate into a mature, fully differentiated plasma cell.<ref name="isbn0-8153-4123-7" /> Differentiation of mature B cells into plasma cells is dependent upon the transcription factors Blimp-1/[[PRDM1]] and [[IRF4]].

==Activity==
After the process of affinity maturation in germinal centers, plasma cells have an indeterminate lifespan, ranging from days to months. Recently they have been shown to reside for much longer periods in the bone marrow as long lived plasma cells (LLPC). They secrete high levels of antibodies, ranging from hundreds to thousands of antibodies per second per cell.<ref name="isbn1-4292-0211-4">{{cite book |author=Kuby, Janis; Kindt, Thomas J.; Goldsby, Richard A.; Osborne, Barbara A. |title=Kuby immunology |publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |year=2007 |pages=13 |isbn=1-4292-0211-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Unlike their precursors, they cannot [[immunoglobulin class switching|switch antibody classes]], cannot act as antigen-presenting cells because they no longer display MHC-II, and do not take up antigen because they no longer display significant quantities of immunoglobulin on the cell surface.<ref name="isbn0-8153-4123-7" /> However, continued exposure to antigen through those low levels of immunoglobulin is important, as it partly determines the cell's lifespan.<ref name="isbn0-8153-4123-7" />
The lifespan, class of antibodies produced, and the location that the plasma cell moves to also depends on signals, such as [[cytokines]], received from the T cell during differentiation.<ref name="isbn3-8055-6460-0" /> Differentiation through a T cell-independent antigen stimulation (stimulation of a B cell that does not require the involvement of a T cell) can happen anywhere in the body<ref name="isbn0-12-053641-2">{{cite book |author=Neuberger, M. S.; Honjo, T.; Alt, Frederick W. |title=Molecular biology of B cells |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |year=2004 |pages=190–191 |isbn=0-12-053641-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> and results in short-lived cells that secrete IgM antibodies.<ref name="isbn3-8055-6460-0" /> The T cell-dependent processes are subdivided into primary and secondary responses: a primary response (meaning that the T cell is present at the time of initial contact by the B cell with the antigen) produces short-lived cells that remain in the extramedullary regions of lymph nodes; a secondary response produces longer-lived cells that produce IgG and IgA, and frequently travel to the bone marrow.<ref name="isbn3-8055-6460-0">{{cite book |author=Federico Caligaris-Cappio; Manlio Ferrarini |title=Human B Cell Populations (Chemical Immunology) (v. 67) |publisher=S. Karger AG (Switzerland) |location= |year=1997 |pages=103–104 |isbn=3-8055-6460-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> For example, plasma cells will likely secrete [[IgG3]] antibodies if they matured in the presence of the cytokine [[interferon-gamma]]. Since B cell maturation also involves [[somatic hypermutation]] (a process completed before differentiation into a plasma cell), these antibodies frequently have a very high affinity for their antigen.

Plasma cells can only produce a single kind of antibody in a single class of immunoglobulin. In other words, every B cell is specific to a single antigen, but each cell can produce several thousand matching antibodies per second.<ref name="isbn0-323-01639-1">{{cite book |author=Kierszenbaum, Abraham L. |title=Histology and cell biology: an introduction to pathology |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2002 |pages=275 |isbn=0-323-01639-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> This prolific production of antibodies is an integral part of the [[humoral immune response]].

== Microscopic anatomy and organelles ==
Plasma cells are large lymphocytes with a considerable [[cell nucleus|nucleus]]-to-[[cytoplasm]] ratio and a characteristic appearance on [[light microscopy]]. They have [[basophilic]] cytoplasm and an eccentric nucleus with [[heterochromatin]] in a characteristic [[cartwheel]] or clock face arrangement. Their cytoplasm also contains a pale zone that on [[electron microscopy]] contains an extensive [[Golgi apparatus]] and [[centriole]]s ([http://www.stritch.luc.edu/lumen/meded/Histo/HistoImages/hl2A-33.jpg EM picture]). Abundant [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]] combined with a well-developed Golgi apparatus makes plasma cells well-suited for secreting immunoglobulins. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}  Other organelles in a Plasma cell include Ribosomes, lysosomes, Mitochondrion, and a Plasma membrane.

==Surface antigens==
Terminally differentiated plasma cells express relatively few surface antigens, and do not express common pan-B cell markers, such as [[CD19]] and [[CD20]]. Instead, plasma cells are identified through [[flow cytometry]] by their additional expression of [[CD38]], [[CD78]], the [[Interleukin-6 receptor]] and lack of expression of [[CD45]]. In humans, CD27 is a good marker for plasma cells, naive B cells are CD27-, memory B-cells are CD27+ and plasma cells are CD27++.<ref name=Bona>{{cite book

==Role in disease==
[[Plasmacytoma]], [[multiple myeloma]], [[Waldenström macroglobulinemia]] and [[plasma cell leukemia]] are [[Hematological malignancy|malignant neoplasms]] ("cancer") of the plasma cells.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000951264|Plasma cell}}</ref> Multiple myeloma is frequently identified because malignant plasma cells continue producing an antibody, which can be detected as a [[paraprotein]].

[[Common variable immunodeficiency]] is thought to be due to a problem in the [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] from lymphocytes to plasma cells. The result is a low serum antibody level and risk of infections.
