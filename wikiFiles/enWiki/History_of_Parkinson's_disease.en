The '''history of Parkinson's disease''' expands from 1817, when British apothecary [[James Parkinson]] published  ''An Essay on the Shaking Palsy'', to modern times. Prior to Parkinson's descriptions, others had already described features of [[Parkinson's disease|the disease that would bear his name]], while the 20th century greatly improved knowledge of the disease and its treatments.<ref name="pmid11983801">{{cite journal |author=Parkinson J |title=An essay on the shaking palsy. 1817 |journal=J.

The term "Parkinson's disease" was coined several decades later by French neurologist [[Jean-Martin Charcot]].<ref name="pmid18175393"/>

==Early descriptions==
Several early sources describe symptoms resembling those of PD.<ref name="pmid15568171">{{cite journal |author=García Ruiz PJ|title=Prehistoria de la enfermedad de Parkinson |trans_title=[Prehistory of Parkinson's disease] |language=Spanish; Castilian |journal=Neurologia |volume=19 |issue=10 |pages=735–7 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15568171 |doi= |url=}}</ref> An [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[papyrus]] from the 12th century B.C. mentions a king [[drooling]] with age and the [[Bible]] contains a number of references to tremor.<ref name="pmid18175393"/><ref name="pmid15568171"/> An [[ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] medical treatise from the 10th century B.C. describes a disease that evolves with tremor, lack of movement, drooling and other symptoms of PD. Moreover, this disease was treated with remedies derived from the [[mucuna]] family, which is rich in L-DOPA.<ref name="pmid15568171"/> [[Galen]] wrote about a disease that almost certainly was PD, describing tremors that occur only at rest, postural changes and paralysis.<ref name="pmid15568171"/><ref name="pmid19892136"/>

After Galen there are no references unambiguously related to PD until the 17th century.<ref name="pmid15568171"/> In this and the following century several authors wrote about elements of the disease, preceding the description by Parkinson. [[Franciscus Sylvius]], like Galen, distinguished tremor at rest from other tremors, while [[Johannes Baptiste Sagar]] and [[Hieronymus David Gaubius]] described [[Parkinsonian Gait|festination]], a term for the gait abnormalities characteristic of PD.<ref name="pmid15568171"/><ref name="pmid19892136"/><ref name="pmid9380070">{{cite journal |author=Koehler PJ, Keyser A |title=Tremor in Latin texts of Dutch physicians: 16th–18th centuries |journal=Mov.

==20th century==
The first speculations concerning the anatomical substrate of PD were made 80 years after Parkinson's essay, when [[Édouard Brissaud]] proposed that it had its origin in the [[subthalamus]] or [[cerebral peduncle]] and might be caused by an [[ischemia|ischemic]] lesion.<ref name="pmid18175393"/> In 1912 [[Frederic Lewy]] described a pathologic finding in affected brains, later named "[[Lewy body|Lewy bodies]]".<ref name="pmid18175393"/> In 1919 [[Konstantin Tretiakoff]] reported that the substantia nigra was the main cerebral structure affected, but this finding was not widely accepted until it was confirmed by further studies published by [[Rolf Hassler]] in 1938.<ref name="pmid18175393"/> The underlying [[biochemical]] changes in the [[brain]] were identified in the 1950s, due largely to the work of [[Arvid Carlsson]] on the neurotransmitter dopamine and its role on PD. Carlsson was eventually awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] for this work.<ref name="pmid18781671"/> Synuclein proteins being the main component of Lewy bodies was discovered in 1997.<ref name="pmid20563819">{{cite journal |author=Schulz-Schaeffer WJ |title=The synaptic pathology of alpha-synuclein aggregation in dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia |journal=Acta Neuropathol. |volume=120 |issue=2 |pages=131–43 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20563819 |pmc=2892607 |doi=10.1007/s00401-010-0711-0 |url=}}</ref>

==History of treatments==
The positive albeit modest effects on tremor of [[anticholinergic]] [[alkaloid]]s obtained from the plant of the [[Atropa belladona|belladona]] were described during 19th century by Charcot, Erb and others. Modern surgery for tremor, consisting of the lesioning of some of the basal ganglia structures was first tried in 1939 and was improved over the following 20 years.<ref name="pmid19892136">{{cite journal |author=Lanska DJ |title=Chapter 33: the history of movement disorders |journal=Handb.
