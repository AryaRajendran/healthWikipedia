'''miraDry''', is the trademark name<ref>[http://www.trademarkia.com/miradry-77886273.html Trademarkia.com miraDry]</ref> of a [[non-invasive]] microwave-based technology<ref>[http://www.internalmedicinenews.com/news/dermatology/single-article/microwave-device-offers-long-term-treatment-for-hyperhidrosis/7aec01c8fe.html Internal Medicine News]</ref> for the treatment of [[axillary hyperhidrosis]] created by [[Miramar Labs]]<ref>[http://www.miradry.com miraDry official website]</ref> in 2006 and [[FDA Cleared]] in 2011.<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf10/K103014.pdf FDA's 510(k) Summary on miraDry]</ref>
Axillary hyperhidrosis, or excessive underarm sweat, is a medical condition where the [[sweat glands]] are overactive, producing more sweat than is needed to cool the body.<ref>[http://sweathelp.org/English/CMN_Article.asp?ArticleCode=75291420&EditionCode=20968148 International Hyperhidrosis Society (March/April 2011 Newsletter)]</ref>

MiraDry is a treatment that destroys sweat glands in the [[axilla]] (underarms) without surgery.  MiraDry currently does not treat hyperhidrosis for hands or feet. 

The treatment is currently offered in both the US and Japan.<ref>[http://www.miradry.com/Japan Miramar Labs Japan Site]</ref>

==Cellular Thermolysis of Sweat Glands==
MiraDry utilizes [[microwave energy]], for the reduction or removal of sweat glands. The current product use is for the treatment of [[Axilla|axillary]] [[hyperhidrosis]].  Microwave energy is suited to address hyperhidrosis because it can penetrate to the [[dermal-fat]] interface where sweat glands reside.<ref>[http://www.no-ets.com/ Hyperhidrosis treatment breakthroughs in recent years ]</ref>

Due to the microwave frequency chosen, device design, and the electromagnetic properties of skin and fat, constructive interference occurs and creates a Focal Energy Zone.<ref>[http://aslms.org/annualconference/110735_ASLMS_FinalProgram_opt.pdf  2011 ASLMS Annual Meeting (April 2011) To view, search for title: Late-breaking Abstract]</ref> The energy generates heat which results in [[thermolysis]] of the sweat glands.

In parallel, a continuous [[hydro-ceramic]] cooling system protects the dermis while heat continues to spread into the region where sweat glands reside, resulting in [[cellular thermolysis]]. Sweat glands do not regenerate,<ref>[http://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Citation/2007/03000/Immunohistochemical_Differentiation_and.67.aspx Beer GM, et al. Immunohistochemical Differentiation and Localization Analysis of Sweat Glands in the Adult Human Axilla. Plast Reconstr Surg 117: 2043, 2006.]</ref> so once destroyed, the excess sweat glands are permanently disabled.
