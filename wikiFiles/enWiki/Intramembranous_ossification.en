'''Intramembranous ossification'''<ref>Literally ''bone formation within membrane''.</ref> is one of the two essential processes during [[fetal]] development of the [[mammal]]ian [[skeleton|skeletal system]] by which [[bone tissue]] is created. Unlike [[endochondral ossification]], which is the other process by which bone tissue is created during fetal development, [[cartilage]] is not present during intramembranous ossification. Intramembranous ossification is also an essential process during the natural healing of [[bone healing|bone fractures]]<ref name= "Brighton">Brighton, Carl T. and Robert M.

==Creation of bone tissue==
[[Image:Mesenchymal_Stem_Cell.jpg|thumb|264px|Mesenchymal stem cell]]
[[Mesenchymal stem cell]]s within [[mesenchyme]] or the [[medullary cavity]] of a bone fracture initiate the process of intramembranous ossification. A mesenchymal stem cell, or MSC, is an unspecialized cell whose [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] undergoes characteristic changes as it develops into an [[osteoblast]]. Before it begins to develop,  the morphological characteristics of a MSC are: a small [[cell body]] with a few cell processes that are long and thin; a large, round [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] with a prominent [[nucleolus]] that is surrounded by finely dispersed [[chromatin]] particles, giving the nucleus a clear appearance; a small amount of [[Golgi apparatus]], [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]], [[mitochondria]], and [[polyribosomes]]; and the cells are widely dispersed within an [[extracellular matrix]] that is devoid of every type of [[collagen]] except for a few [[reticular fiber|reticular]] fibrils.<ref name= "Brighton">Brighton and Hunt (1991)</ref>

Then a small group of adjacent MSCs begin to [[replicate]] until they have formed a small, dense aggregation of cells, a [[Nodule (medicine)|nodule]]. Once a nodule has been formed the MSCs within it stop replicating. At this point, changes in the morphology of the MSCs occur: the cell body becomes larger and rounder; the long, thin cell processes are no longer present; and the amount of Golgi apparatus and rough endoplasmic reticulum increases. Eventually, all of the cells within the aggregate display the morphologic characteristics of an [[osteoprogenitor|osteoprogenitor cell]].<ref name= "Brighton" />

At this stage of development, changes in the morphology of the osteoprogenitor cells occur: their shape becomes more columnar; the amount of Golgi apparatus and rough endoplasmic reticulum increases; and the cells begin to create an extracellular matrix consisting of [[Type-I collagen]] fibrils. This matrix is [[osteoid]] and the cells that created it are [[osteoblasts]]. The osteoblasts, while lining the periphery of the nodule, continue to form osteoid at the center of the nodule. Some of the osteoblasts become incorporated within the osteoid to become [[osteocyte]]s.<ref name= "Brighton" />

[[Image:Bony_nidus_3.jpg|thumb|264px|Osteoblasts creating rudimentary bone tissue]]
At this point, the osteoid becomes mineralized resulting in a nidus consisting of mineralized osteoid that contains osteocytes and is lined by active osteoblasts. The nidus, that began as a diffuse collection of MSCs, has become rudimentary [[bone tissue]].<ref name= "Brighton" />

==Overview==
The first step in the process is the formation of '''bone spicules''' which eventually fuse with each other and become [[trabeculae]]. The [[periosteum]] is formed and bone growth continues at the surface of trabeculae. Much like spicules, the increasing growth of trabeculae result in interconnection and this network is called woven bone. Eventually, woven bone is replaced by [[lamellar bone]].

==Formation of bone spicules==
[[Embryo]]logic [[mesenchymal cell]]s ('''MSC''') condense into layers of vascularized primitive [[connective tissue]]. Certain  mesenchymal cells group together, usually near or around blood vessels, and differentiate into osteogenic cells which deposit bone [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] [[Secretory pathway|constitutively]]. These aggregates of bony [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] are called '''bone spicules'''. Separate mesenchymal cells differentiate into [[osteoblast]]s, which line up along the surface of the spicule and secrete more [[osteoid]], which increases the size of the spicule.

==Formation of woven bone==
As the spicules continue to grow, they fuse with adjacent spicules and this results in the formation of [[trabecula]]e. When [[osteoblast]]s become trapped in the matrix they secrete, they differentiate into [[osteocyte]]s. Osteoblasts continue to line up on the surface which increases the size. As growth continues, trabeculae become interconnected and woven bone is formed. The term '''primary spongiosa''' is also used to refer to the initial trabecular network.

==Primary center of ossification==
The [[periosteum]] is formed around the trabeculae by differentiating mesenchymal cells. The '''primary center of ossification''' is the area where bone growth occurs between the [[periosteum]] and the bone. Osteogenic cells that originate from the periosteum increase appositional growth and a '''bone collar''' is formed. The bone collar is eventually mineralized and lamellar bone is formed.

==Formation of osteon==
[[Osteon]]s are units or principal structures of compact bone. During the formation of bone spicules, [[cytoplasm]]ic processes from osteoblasts interconnect. This becomes the '''canaliculi''' of osteons. Since bone spicules tend to form around [[blood vessel]]s, the perivascular space is greatly reduced as the bone continues to grow. When replacement to compact bone occurs, this blood vessel becomes the '''central canal''' of the osteon.
