The '''recurrent laryngeal nerve''' (RLN) is a branch of the [[vagus nerve]] (tenth [[cranial nerve]]) that supplies motor function and sensation to the [[larynx]] (voice box). It travels within the [[endoneurium]]. It is the nerve of the 6th [[pharyngeal arch]].

==Function==
Other than the cricothyroid muscle which is innervated by the superior laryngeal nerve, motor control of all the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, the [[thyroarytenoid muscle|thyroarytenoid]], the [[posterior cricoarytenoid muscle|posterior]] and [[lateral cricoarytenoid muscle|lateral cricoarytenoid]], and [[arytenoid muscle]]s depends upon the recurrent laryngeal nerve.  Additionally, it transmits sensory information from the mucous membranes of the larynx from the lower surface of the vocal fold, downwards.<ref name=Moore3rd>{{Citation |title= Clinically Oriented Anatomy |year= 1992 |last= Moore |first= Keith L |edition= 3rd |pages= 847–9  |isbn= 068306133X }}</ref>

==Path==
[[File:Gray505.png|thumb|left|alt=The vagus nerves and major blood vessels|Passing under the [[subclavian artery]], the right recurrent laryngeal nerve has a much shorter course than the left which passes under the [[aortic arch]] and [[ligamentum arteriosum]].]]
The nerves are named "recurrent" (from the Latin {{lang|la|re-}} ("back") and {{lang|la|currere}} "to run"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/recur |title= Recur |work= Free Dictionary |publisher= Merriam-Webster |accessdate= March 1, 2013 }}</ref>) because they are oriented in the opposite direction to the [[vagus nerve]] from which it branches.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/recurrent?show=0&t=1362154002 |title= Recurrent |work= Medical definition and more |publisher= Merriam-Webster |accessdate= March 1, 2013 }}</ref> Neurons which innervate the [[Larynx#Muscles|laryngeal muscles]] in the neck do so via a circuitous route, descending into the [[thorax]] and looping around a large artery before rising up along the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and [[esophagus]] before returning to the neck.

The [[vagus nerve]]s exit the skull and run alongside the carotid arteries through the neck into the chest. In the common anatomic configuration, the RLN branches off the vagus at the vessel where the carotid originates, the [[aortic arch]] on the left and the [[subclavian artery]] on the right. The recurrent branches pass anteriorly to (in front of) the vessel, then wrap under and behind the vessel. The left RLN is longer than the right, because it crosses under the [[aortic arch|arch of the aorta]] at the [[ligamentum arteriosum]]. The recurrent nerves typically ascend along the groove at the junction of the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and [[esophagus]].<ref name=Schwartz9th>{{cite book |author1= F.

As it ascends in the neck it gives off branches, more numerous on the left than on the right side, to the mucous membrane and muscular coat of the [[esophagus]]; branches to the mucous membrane and muscular fibers of the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]; and some pharyngeal filaments to the [[superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle]].

The nerve splits into anterior and posterior rami before supplying muscles in the voice box – it supplies all laryngeal [[muscle]]s except for the [[cricothyroid muscle|cricothyroid]], which is innervated by the external branch of the [[superior laryngeal nerve]].

The recurrent laryngeal nerve enters the pharynx, along with the [[inferior laryngeal artery]] and [[inferior laryngeal vein]], below the inferior constrictor muscle to innervate the Intrinsic Muscles of the larynx responsible for controlling the movements of the vocal folds.

== Development ==

During human (and all [[vertebrate]]) development, a series of [[pharyngeal arch]] pairs, projecting [[ventral]]ly (towards the front of the face and neck). Each arch develops its own artery, nerve which controls a distinct muscle group, and skeletal tissue. Starting from the head, they are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 to correspond with the six arches of the most closely related fish. If arch 5 forms at all, it is a transiently existing rudiment. Arches 4 and 6 produce the laryngeal cartilages. The nerve of Arch 6 becomes the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The nerve of Arch 4 gives rise to the superior laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve which controls several muscles involved in speech and swallowing; its arteries, which project between the nerves of the fourth and sixth arches, become left-sided arch of the aorta and the right subclavian artery. On the right side, the artery of Arch 6 is obliterated while, on the left side, the artery persists as the [[ductus arteriosus]]; circulatory changes immediatey following birth cause the vessel to close down leaving a remnant, the [[ligamentum arteriosum]]. During growth, these arteries descend into their ultimate positions in the chest, creating the elongated recurrent paths.<ref>{{cite book |last= Larsen |first= William J. |pages= 318–323|title=Human embryology |year=1993 |publisher= Churchill Livingstone |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6KxqAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=February 26, 2013 |isbn=0-443-08724-5}}</ref>

In about 1 in 100 to 200 people, the right inferior laryngeal nerve is nonrecurrent, branching off the vagus nerve around the level of the [[cricoid cartilage]]. Typically, such a configuration is accompanied by variation in the arrangement of the major arteries in the chest; most commonly, the right subclavian artery arises from the left side of the aorta and crosses behind the esophagus. A left nonrecurrent inferior laryngeal nerve is even more uncommon, requiring the aortic arch be on the right side (mirror image anatomy—[[situs inversus]]) accompanied by an arterial variant which prevents the nerve from being drawn into the chest by the left subclavian.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Quan-Yang Duh|author2=Orlo H.

==Clinical significance==
The nerve is best known for its importance in [[thyroid]] and [[parathyroid]] surgery, because of its course behind the thyroid gland.<ref name=Schwartz9th /> If it is damaged during surgery, the patient will have [[hoarseness]]. Nerve damage can be assessed by [[laryngoscopy]], during which a [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] light confirms the absence of movement in the affected side of the vocal cords.

Similar problems may also be due to invasion of the nerve by a [[tumor]] or after [[Physical trauma|trauma]] to the neck. A common scenario is paralysis of the left vocal cord due to malignant tumour in the mediastinum affecting the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. The left cord returns to midline where it stays.
* If the damage is ''unilateral'', the patient may present with voice changes including hoarseness.
* ''Bilateral'' nerve damage can result in breathing difficulties and [[aphonia]], the inability to speak.
* The right recurrent laryngeal nerve is more susceptible to damage during thyroid surgery due to its relatively medial location.

== Veterinary ==
Horses are subject to a condition which causes injury, '''equine recurrent laryngeal neuropathy''', a [[axonopathy|disease of the axons]]. The cause is not known, although a genetic predisposition is suspected. The length of the nerve is a factor since it is more common in larger horses and left side is affected almost exclusively. As the nerve cells die, there is a progressive paralysis of the larynx, causing the airway to collapse. The common presentation is a [[Stertor|sound]], ranging from a musical whistle to a harsh roar, accompanied by worsening performance. The condition is incurable, but surgery can keep the airway open. Experiments with nerve grafts have been tried.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Munroe |first1=Graham |last2=Weese |first2=Scott |title=Equine Clinical Medicine, Surgery and Reproduction|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Cu-XUjVS85QC&pg=PA421|accessdate=March 2, 2013|date=March 15, 2011|publisher=Manson Publishing|isbn=978-1-84076-608-0|pages=421–426}}</ref>

Although uncommon in dogs, bilateral RLN disease may be the cause of a [[stridor|wheezing sound]] when middle-aged dogs are breathing in.<ref>{{cite book|last=Slatter|first=Douglas H. |title=Textbook of Small Animal Surgery|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B_nh6zSr4wUC&pg=PA771|accessdate=March 2, 2013|year=2003|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-7216-8607-3|page=771}}</ref>

==History==
[[Galen]] demonstrated the nerve course and the clinical syndrome of recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis in animals when both nerves were severed, and described the same effect in two human infants who had undergone surgery for goiter.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Gross |first1= Charles G. |year= 1998 |month= May |title= Galen and the Squealing Pig |journal= Neuroscientist |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages= 216–221 |issn= 10738584 |doi= 10.1177/107385849800400317 |accessdate= January 12, 2012 }}</ref> In 1838, five years before he would introduce the concept of [[Homology (biology)|homology]] to biology, the famed anatomist Richard Owen reported upon the dissection of three giraffes, including a description of the full course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve.<ref>{{citation|last=Owen|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Owen|title=Transactions of the Zoological Society of London|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4ulEAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA217|accessdate=February 27, 2013|year=1841|publisher=Zoological Society of London|pages=217–248|chapter=Notes on the dissection of the Nubian giraffe}}</ref><ref name="BerryHallam1986">{{cite book|author1=Robert James Berry|author2=Anthony Hallam|title=The Collins Encyclopedia of Animal Evolution|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z1ZnQgAACAAJ|accessdate=February 27, 2013|year=1986|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Limited|isbn=978-0-00-219818-9|pages=82–83}}</ref>

==Evidence of evolution==
The extreme detour of this nerve (about 15 feet in the case of [[giraffe]]s<ref>{{Cite book | title=Mammal Anatomy: An Illustrated Guide | year=2010 | publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corporation | pages=74–75 | isbn=0-7614-7882-5 }}</ref>) is cited as [[evidence of evolution]] as opposed to intelligent design. The nerve's route would have been direct in the fish-like ancestors of modern tetrapods, traveling from the brain, past the heart, to the gills (as it does in modern fish). Over the course of evolution, as the neck extended and the heart became lower in the body, the laryngeal nerve was caught on the wrong side of the heart. Natural selection gradually lengthened the nerve by tiny increments to accommodate, resulting in the circuitous route now observed.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dawkins |first= Richard |authorlink= Richard Dawkins |title= The greatest show on Earth |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=U8AFxmc76rcC |accessdate= November 21, 2009 |year= 2009 |publisher= Free Press |location= New York |isbn= 978-1-4165-9478-9 |pages= 360–362 |chapter= 11.
