'''''Ehrlichia'' Wisconsin HM543746''' is an unnamed [[tick]] bacteria that spread through [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]] in 2009 and is similar to ''[[Ehrlichia muris]]''.<ref name="Medical">{{cite web |url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/232284.php |title = New European, Asian Tick Bacteria Emerges In The United States |first = Sy |last = Kraft |date = August 4, 2011 |work=[[Medical News Today]]}}</ref>

Researchers took more than 4000 [[blood sample]]s from people who appeared to have [[ehrlichiosis]] or [[anaplasmosis]], and used 697 ticks from both states as test subjects<ref name = "Medical"/> The researchers, working at the [[Mayo Clinic]], used [[molecular]] methods, culturing, and [[serological]] testing.<ref name="Journal">{{cite web |url = http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1010493?query=featured_home& | author=Pritt, Bobbi S.,  et al. | title = Emergence of a New Pathogenic Ehrlichia Species, Wisconsin and Minnesota, 2009 | date = August 4, 2011 |work=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]}}</ref> The research was conducted after technologist Carol Werner noticed an unnatural Ehrlichia [[Polymerase chain reaction]].<ref name="Daily">{{cite web |url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110803174745.htm |title = New Bacterium Found Causing Tick-Borne Illness Ehrlichiosis in Wisconsin and Minnesota |date = August 3, 2011 |work=[[Science Daily]]}}</ref> The investigation arrived at the discovery of the new bacteria because the research showed that 4 of the patients were infected by a new bacteria; their symptoms in 2009 including fevers, headaches, [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[nausea]], and vomiting. All four of the patients survived by being treated with [[doxycycline]].<ref name="Journal"/>

The results were published in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' and brought up in a Health Alert Network public health announcement.<ref name="Journal"/> The lead researcher Bobbi Pritt said, "Before this report, human ehrlichiosis was thought to be very rare or absent in Minnesota and Wisconsin, therefore, physicians might not know to look for Ehrlichia infections at all." The [[entomologist]] Susan Paskewitz said that owing to the increase of [[Ixodes scapularis|deer ticks]] in Wisconsin, there may be further incidents of this bacteria infecting people.<ref name="Daily"/> Before the discovery, the tick bacteria ''[[Ehrlichia chaffeensis]]'' and ''[[Ehrlichia ewingii]]'' were believed to be the only causes of ehrlichiosis in the United States.<ref name="Journal"/>
