'''Synovial fluid''' is a viscous, [[non-Newtonian fluid]] found in the cavities of [[synovial joint]]s. With its yolk-like consistency ("synovial" partially derives from ''ovum'', [[Latin language|Latin]] for [[egg (biology)|egg]]), the principal role of synovial fluid is to reduce friction between the [[articular cartilage]] of synovial joints during movement.

==Overview==
The inner membrane of synovial joints is called the [[synovial membrane]] and secretes synovial fluid into the joint cavity. The fluid contains [[hyaluronic acid]] secreted by fibroblast-like cells in the synovial membrane and interstitial fluid filtered from the blood plasma.<ref>Principles of Anatomy & Physiology, 12th Edition, Tortora & Derrickson, Pub: Wiley & Sons</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2013}}  This fluid forms a thin layer (roughly 50 [[micrometre|μm]]) at the surface of cartilage and also seeps into microcavities and irregularities in the articular cartilage surface, filling all empty space.<ref name=edwards2000>{{cite web

During movement, the synovial fluid held in the cartilage is squeezed out [[mechanics|mechanically]] to maintain a layer of fluid on the cartilage surface (so-called ''weeping lubrication'').
The functions of the synovial fluid include: 
*reduction of friction - synovial fluid lubricates the articulating joints<ref>McCracken, Thomas (2000). New Atlas of Human Anatomy. China: Metro Books. pp. 1-240. ISBN 1-58663-097-0.</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2013}}
*shock absorption - as a [[dilatant]] fluid, synovial fluid is characterized by the rare quality of becoming more viscous under applied pressure; the synovial fluid in diarthrotic joints becomes thick the moment shear is applied in order to protect the joint and subsequently, thins to normal viscosity instantaneously to resume its lubricating function between shocks
*nutrient and waste transportation - the fluid supplies oxygen and nutrients and removes carbon dioxide and metabolic wastes from the [[chondrocytes]] within the surrounding [[cartilage]]

==Composition==
Synovial tissue is sterile and composed of vascularized connective tissue that lacks a basement membrane. Two cell types (type A and type B) are present: Type A is derived from blood monocytes, and it removes the wear-and-tear debris from the synovial fluid. Type B produces synovial fluid. Synovial fluid is made of hyaluronic acid and lubricin, proteinases, and collagenases. Synovial fluid exhibits [[non-Newtonian fluid|non-Newtonian flow]] characteristics; the viscosity coefficient is not a constant and the fluid is not linearly viscous.  Synovial fluid has [[thixotropic]] characteristics; viscosity decreases and the fluid thins over a period of continued stress.<ref name=elert>{{cite web

It also contains phagocytic cells that remove microbes and the debris that results from normal wear and tear in the joint.

==Health and disease==
===Collection===
Synovial fluid may be collected by syringe in a procedure termed [[arthrocentesis]], also known as joint aspiration.

===Classification===
Synovial fluid may be classified into normal, noninflammatory, inflammatory, septic, and hemorrhagic:

== Analysis ==
The cytological and biochemical analysis of human synovial fluid began around 1940 using cadaver-derived fluid and comparing characteristics to those of, for instance, bovine synovial fluid.<ref>{{Citation

=== Chemistry === 
The mucin clot test is a very old approach to determining if an inflammatory infiltrate is present.  In this test, acetic acid is added to the synovial fluid specimen.  In a normal specimen, this should lead to a congealing of the hyaluronic acid, forming a 'mucin clot.'  If inflammation is present, a mucin clot is not formed (the hyaluronic acid is degraded).<ref name=demais2009>{{Citation

Lactate is elevated in septic arthritis, usually above 250 mg/dL.

Complement factors are decreased in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus arthritis.

=== Microscopy ===
Microscopic analysis of synovial fluid is performed to evluate for cell count and crystals.  Crystals include [[monosodium urate]], [[calcium pyrophosphate]], [[hydroxyapatite]] and [[corticosteroid]] crystals.<ref name=demais2009/>

[[Monosodium urate]] crystals are seen in [[gout]]/gouty arthritis and appear as needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals varying in length from 2 to 20 microns.  With negative birefringence, the crystals appear yellow in parallel light and blue with perpendicular light.

[[Calcium pyrophosphate]] crystals are seen in [[pseudogout]] (aka calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease or CPPD).  These crystals are rod-shaped or rhomboids varying in length from 2 to 20 microns and with positie birefringence (blue with parallel light, yellow with perpendicular light).  

[[Hydroxyapatite]] crystals are small and negatively birefringent.  They are usually only detectable with an Alizarin Red S stain.

[[Corticosteroid]] crystals may be seen following therapeutic corticosteroid injection into the joint space.  They apper blunt, jagged and show variable birefringence.<ref name=demais2009/>

===Cracking joints===
{{main|Cracking joints}}
When the two articulating surfaces of a synovial joint are separated from one other, the volume within the joint capsule increases and a negative pressure results. The volume of synovial fluid within the joint is insufficient to fill the expanding volume of the joint and gases dissolved in the synovial fluid (mostly [[carbon dioxide]]) are liberated and quickly fill the empty space, leading to the rapid formation of a bubble.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Unsworth A, Dowson D, Wright V. | title = 'Cracking joints'.
