'''Corpo de Bombeiros de Macau''' or '''Macau Corps of Firefighters''' is responsible for fire and rescue services in [[Macau]]. The current civilian agency CDBM was formed in 1999, but volunteer fire brigades dates back to 1851 and full time department in 1883. Prior to 1851, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] military provided fire services in the colony. Today the department is organized under the [[Macau Security Force]] (since 1976 after decades as a division of public works, Leal Senado and municipal control). The brigade is responsible for fire and rescue for both land and air.

The Fire Brigade operates ambulance service (Ambul창ncia de Macau), but the [[Macau Red Cross]] also operates ambulances ([[Toyota HiAce]] vans) for emergency and non-emergencies to local hospitals with volunteer staff.<ref>http://www.redcross.org.mo/en/care_ambulance.htm</ref>

The organization has a total of 739 uniformed firefighters and paramedics serving from 7 fire stations in Macau with one central HQ on Macau.
