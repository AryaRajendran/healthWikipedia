The '''Epley maneuver''' or ''' repositioning maneuver''' is a maneuver used to treat [[benign paroxysmal positional vertigo]] (BPPV)<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003162.pub2 |title=The Epley (canalith repositioning) manoeuvre for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2004 |last1=Hilton |first1=Malcolm P |last2=Pinder |first2=Darren K |editor1-last=Hilton |editor1-first=Malcolm P |pmid=15106194 |issue=2 |pages=CD003162}}</ref> of  the posterior or anterior canals.<ref name=one>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.mlg.0000175062.36144.b9 |title=Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo: 10-Year Experience in Treating 592 Patients with Canalith Repositioning Procedure |year=2005 |last1=Prokopakis |first1=Emmanuel P. |last2=Chimona |first2=Theognosia |last3=Tsagournisakis |first3=Minas |last4=Christodoulou |first4=Panagiotis |last5=Hirsch |first5=Barry E. |last6=Lachanas |first6=Vassilios A. |last7=Helidonis |first7=Emmanuel S. |last8=Plaitakis |first8=Andreas |last9=Velegrakis |first9=George A. |journal=The Laryngoscope |volume=115 |issue=9 |pages=1667–71 |pmid=16148714}}</ref> Free floating particles from the affected [[semicircular canal]] are relocated, using gravity, back into the [[utricle]], where they can no longer stimulate the cupula, therefore relieving the patient of bothersome vertigo.<ref name=one /><ref name=two>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00005537-199906000-00011 |title=Success of the modified epley maneuver in treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo |year=1999 |last1=Wolf |first1=Jeffrey S. |last2=Boyev |first2=Kestutis P. |last3=Manokey |first3=Brenda J. |last4=Mattox |first4=Douglas E. |journal=The Laryngoscope |volume=109 |issue=6 |pages=900–3 |pmid=10369279}}</ref> It is often performed by a doctor, chiropractor, occupational therapist or physical therapist, after confirmation of a diagnosis of [[BPPV]] using the [[Dix-Hallpike test]] and has a reported success rate of between 90–95%.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00005537-200106000-00003 |title=Therapeutic Efficacy of the Epley Canalith Repositioning Maneuver |year=2001 |last1=Ruckenstein |first1=Michael J. |journal=The Laryngoscope |volume=111 |issue=6 |pages=940–5 |pmid=11404601}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0196-0709(03)00069-3 |title=Efficacy of particle repositioning maneuver in BPPV: A prospective study |year=2003 |last1=Simhadri |first1=Sridhar |last2=Panda |first2=Naresh |last3=Raghunathan |first3=Meena |journal=American Journal of Otolaryngology |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=355–60 |pmid=14608565}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15742768 |year=2005 |last1=Richard |first1=W |last2=Bruintjes |first2=TD |last3=Oostenbrink |first3=P |last4=Van Leeuwen |first4=RB |title=Efficacy of the Epley maneuver for posterior canal BPPV: A long-term, controlled study of 81 patients |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=22–5 |journal=Ear, nose, & throat journal}}</ref> This maneuver was developed by Dr. John Epley and first described in 1980.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=7443266 |year=1980 |last1=Epley |first1=JM |title=New dimensions of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo |volume=88 |issue=5 |pages=599–605 |journal=Otolaryngology and head and neck surgery}}</ref> Physiotherapists and some chiropractors now use a version of the maneuver called the "modified" Epley that does not include vibrations of the mastoid process originally indicated by Epley, as they have since been shown not to improve the efficacy of the treatment.<ref name="test">{{cite journal |pmid=14517129 |year=2003 |last1=Parnes |first1=LS |last2=Agrawal |first2=SK |last3=Atlas |first3=J |title=Diagnosis and management of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) |volume=169 |issue=7 |pages=681–93 |pmc=202288 |journal=CMAJ}}</ref>

==Sequence of positions==

The following sequence of positions describes the Epley maneuver:
# The patient begins in an upright sitting posture, with the legs fully extended and the head rotated 45 degrees towards the affected side.
# The patient is then quickly and passively forced down backwards by the clinician performing the treatment into a supine position with the head held approximately in a 30 degree neck extension ([[Dix-Hallpike test|Dix-Hallpike]] position) where the affected ear faces the ground.
# The clinician observes the patient's eyes for “primary stage” [[nystagmus]].
# The patient remains in this position for approximately 1–2 minutes.
# The patient's head is then turned 90 degrees to the opposite direction so that the unaffected ear faces the ground, all while maintaining the 30 degree neck extension.
# The patient remains in this position for approximately 1–2 minutes.
# Keeping the head and neck in a fixed position relative to the body, the individual rolls onto their shoulder, rotating the head another 90 degrees in the direction that they are facing. The patient is now looking downwards at a 45 degree angle.
# The eyes should be immediately observed by the clinician for “secondary stage” nystagmus and this secondary stage nystagmus should beat in the same direction as the primary stage nystagmus. The patient remains in this position for approximately 1–2 minutes.
# Finally, the patient is slowly brought up to an upright sitting posture, while maintaining the 45 degree rotation of the head.
# The patient holds sitting position for up to 30 seconds.

The entire procedure may be repeated two more times, for a total of three times.

During every step of this procedure the patient may experience some dizziness.

==Post-treatment==

Following the treatment, the clinician may provide the patient with a soft collar, often worn for the remainder of the day, as a cue to avoid any head positions that may once again displace the otoconia. The patient may be instructed to be cautious of bending over, lying backwards, moving the head up and down, or tilting the head to either side. The soft collar is removed prior to bed. When doing so, the patient should be encouraged to perform horizontal movements of the head to maintain normal neck range of motion.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schubert |first1=Michael C. |year=2007 |chapter=Vestibular Disorders |editor1-first=Susan B. |editor1-last=O'Sullivan |editor2-first=Thomas J. |editor2-last=Schmitz |edition=5th |title=Physical Rehabilitation |pages=999–1029 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=F.A. Davis |isbn=978-0-8036-1247-1}}</ref> 

It is important to instruct the patient that horizontal movement of the head should be performed to prevent stiff neck muscles.

It is still uncertain in the research literature whether activity restrictions following the treatment improves the effectiveness of the canalith repositioning maneuver. However, patients who were not provided with any activity restrictions needed one or two additional treatment sessions in order to attain a successful outcome.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Herdman |first1=S. |year=2000 |chapter=Vestibular rehabilitation |edition=3rd |title=Physical therapy diagnosis for vestibular disorders |pages=228–308 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=F.

The Epley maneuver appears to be a long-term effective conservative treatment for BPPV that has a limited number of complications (nausea, vomiting, and residual vertigo)<ref name=one />  and is well tolerated by patients.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00005537-199702000-00009 |title=Time Course of Recovery After Epley Maneuvers for Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo |year=1997 |last1=Smouha |first1=Eric E. |journal=The Laryngoscope |volume=107 |issue=2 |pages=187–91 |pmid=9023241}}</ref>

==Background Information==

The goal of the Epley or Modified Epley maneuver is to restore equilibrium of the [[vestibular system]], more specifically to the semicircular canals to treat the symptoms associated with [[BPPV]]. There is compelling evidence that free floating [[otoconia]], probably displaced from the otolithic membrane in the [[utricle]] are the main cause of this disequilibrium.<ref name="test" /> Recent pathological findings also suggest that the displaced [[otoconia]] typically settle in the posterior semicircular canal in the [[cupula]] of the [[Osseous ampullae|ampulla]] and render it sensitive to gravity.<ref name="test" /> The cupula move in relation to acceleration of the head during rotary movements and signal to the brain via [[action potentials]] which way the head is moving in relation to its surroundings. However, once a crystal becomes lodged in the cupula, it only takes slight head movements in combination with gravity to create an action potential, which signals to the brain that the head is moving through space where in reality it is not, thus creating the feeling of [[vertigo]] associated with BPPV.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/00016480903456318 |title=Model experiments of otoconia stability after canalith repositioning procedure of BPPV |year=2010 |last1=Otsuka |first1=Koji |last2=Suzuki |first2=Mamoru |last3=Shimizu |first3=Shigetaka |last4=Konomi |first4=Ujimoto |last5=Inagaki |first5=Taro |last6=Iimura |first6=Yoichi |last7=Hayashi |first7=Mami |last8=Ogawa |first8=Yasuo |journal=Acta Oto-laryngologica |volume=130 |issue=7 |pages=804–9 |pmid=20095871}}</ref>

When a therapist is performing the Epley or Modified Epley maneuver, the patient's head is rotated to 45 degrees in the direction of the affected side, in order to target the posterior semicircular canal of the affected side.<ref name="test" /> When the patient is passively positioned from an upright seated posture down to a lying (supine) position, this momentum helps to dislodge the [[otoconia]] (crystal) embedded in the [[cupula]]. Steps 3–10 in the above mentioned procedure are causing the newly dislodged crystal to be brought back to the utricle through the posterior semi circular canal so that it can be re-absorbed by the utricle.<ref name="test" />
