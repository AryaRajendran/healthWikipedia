Alavi began his work in PET in the 1970’s, and is recognized as an innovator in this field. He has made contributions to the field of modern medical imaging, including the introduction of [[18FDG]]-[[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) with his colleagues.

He and his colleagues have conducted pioneering research in modern imaging techniques including PET, [[SPECT]], [[Ct scan|CT]] and [[MRI]].  He is an expert in modern imaging techniques and the clinical applications of PET imaging for the detection of cancer and other disorders including [[dementia]], seizures, cardiovascular disease, and infection. He served as a member and chairman of scientific study sections at the [[NIH]] and [[American Cancer Society]].   He has published numerous scientific papers, and is the most cited faculty member at  U Penn. 
He is a educator, and his former students and research fellows now occupy positions in Nuclear Medicine worldwide.

==PET==
[[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) is a nuclear medical imaging technique that produces a three-dimensional image or picture of functional processes in the body. The system detects pairs of [[gamma ray]]s emitted indirectly by a positron-emitting radionuclide (tracer), which is introduced into the body on a biologically active molecule. 
One of the factors most responsible for the acceptance of positron imaging was the development of radiopharmaceuticals. 
In particular, the development of labeled 2-[[Fludeoxyglucose (18F)]] (2FDG) by the Brookhaven group under the direction of Al Wolf and Joanna Fowler was a major factor in expanding the scope of PET imaging. 

The compound was first administered to two normal human volunteers by Alavi in August 1976 at the University of Pennsylvania.
