'''Brevetoxin''' (PbTx), or brevetoxins, are a suite of cyclic [[ether#Polyethers|polyether]] compounds produced naturally by a species of [[dinoflagellate]] known as ''[[Karenia brevis]]''.  Brevetoxins are neurotoxins that bind to [[voltage-gated sodium channel]]s in nerve cells, leading to disruption of normal neurological processes and causing the illness clinically described as [[neurotoxic shellfish poisoning]] (NSP).<ref name="watkins">{{ cite journal | author = Watkins SM, Reich A, Fleming LE, Hammond R | title = Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning | journal = Marine Drugs | year = 2008 | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 431–455 | pmc = 2579735 | doi = 10.3390/md20080021 | pmid = 19005578 }}</ref>

Although brevetoxins are most well-studied in ''K. brevis'', they are also found in other species of ''[[Karenia (dinoflagellate)|Karenia]]'' and at least one large [[fish kill]] has been traced to brevetoxins in ''[[Chattonella]]''.<ref name="watkins" />

Other Brevetoxins:
*Brevetoxin-5 (PbTx-5): like PbTx-3, but [[Acetylation|acetylated]] [[hydroxyl]] group in position 38.
*Brevetoxin-6 (PbTx-6): like PbTx-2, but double bond 27-28 is [[Epoxide|epoxidated]].

== Biosynthesis ==
A proposed biosynthetic route includes a novel [[polyketide]] formation involving  [[Claisen condensation]] of a dicarboxylic acid with the alpha-position of  the second  carboxylic function with a loss of a carboxyl group.<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Chou HN, Shimizu Y | title = Biosynthesis  of Brevetoxins.
