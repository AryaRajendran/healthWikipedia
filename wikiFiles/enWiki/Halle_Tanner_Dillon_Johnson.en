'''Halle Tanner Dillon Johnson''' (1864 â€“ 26 April 1901) was an [[United States|American]] [[physician]] who in 1891 became the first female [[African-American]] doctor in [[Alabama]].

==Biography==
===Early years===
Johnson was born '''Halle Tanner''' in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], the oldest daughter of nine children to Benjamin Tucker and Sarah Elizabeth Tanner. Johnson was well educated and as a young girl became familiar with the work of prominent African-American intellectuals. She worked with her father on ''[[The Christian Recorder]]'', a publication of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], where he ministered. 

Around the time of her graduation, African-American educator [[Booker T. Washington]], founder of the [[Tuskegee Institute]] in [[Alabama]], had written to the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania to request a nomination for a teaching position he had been struggling to fill for four years. He hoped to find an African-American physician to serve the school and its surrounding community. Johnson  accepted Washington's offer of [[United States dollar|US$]]600 a month, including lodging and meals, and arrived to begin her service in August 1891.

In 1886 Johnson married Charles Dillon, and the couple had a child before her husband's sudden death. A widow at 24, Johnson returned to live with her family and decided to enter medical school. After three years of study at the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, she earned her M.D. in 1891, graduating with honors.

===Career===
Before beginning her new job, however, young Dr. Dillon had to face a significant obstacle: passing the Alabama State Medical Examination. The very fact that she was sitting for the examination caused a public stir in [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. She spent ten days taking the exam, addressing a different area of medicine each day. Her examiners included the directors and leading figures of most of the state's major medical institutions. Dillon impressed them with her responses and she passed the test. 

Dr. Dillion was the first woman to practice medicine in the state of Alabama.<ref> {{cite book | last1 = Birmingham Museum of Art | title = Birmingham Museum of Art: A Guide to the Collection | publisher = Giles | year = 2010 | location = London | pages = 139 | url = http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/bmapu.html | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | isbn = 978-1-904832-77-5}}</ref>

During her brief tenure at Tuskegee she was responsible for the health care of the school's 450 students and 30 faculty and staff. She also established a training school for nurses and founded the [[Lafayette Dispensary]] to serve the health care needs of local residents, often mixing medicines herself for their use. She also taught two classes each day.

===Personal life===
Johnson's tenure at Tuskegee ended in 1894 when she married the Reverend John Quincy Johnson, an African Methodist Episcopal minister and math instructor at Tuskegee. The couple moved first to [[Columbia, South Carolina]], where Reverend Johnson became president of [[Allen University]], a private school for black students. They later moved from [[Hartford, Connecticut]] to [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and then to [[Princeton, New Jersey]], as Reverend Johnson pursued undergraduate and graduate degrees in [[theology]]. Finally, in 1900 the couple settled in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] with their three children, and Reverend Johnson became the pastor of Saint Paul A.M.E. Church. Johnson died in Nashville from complications during childbirth.
