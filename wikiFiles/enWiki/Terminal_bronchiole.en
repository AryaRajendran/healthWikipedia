A '''terminal bronchiole''' is a [[bronchiole]] at the end of the [[conducting zone]]. At the transition into the [[respiratory zone]], [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] become present.

The terminal bronchiole is the most distal segment of the conducting zone. It branches off the lesser bronchioles. Each of the terminal bronchioles divides to form [[Respiratory_bronchiole|respiratory bronchioles]] which contain a small number of alveoli.  Terminal bronchioles are lined with simple cuboidal epithelium containing [[Clara cell]]s.  Terminal bronchioles contain a limited number of ciliated cells and no goblet cells.  Clara cells are non-ciliated, rounded protein secreting cells.  Their secretions are a nonsticky, proteinaceous compound to maintain the airway in the smallest bronchioles.  The secretion, called [[surfactant]], reduces [[surface tension]], allowing for bronchioles to expand during inspiration and keeping the bronchioles from collapsing during expiration.  Clara cells, a stem cell of the respiratory system, produce enzymes that detoxify substances dissolved in the respiratory fluid.
