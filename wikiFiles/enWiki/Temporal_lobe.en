The '''temporal lobe''' is a region of the [[cerebral cortex]] that is located beneath the [[lateral fissure]] on both [[cerebral hemisphere]]s of the mammalian [[brain]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Temporal Lobe|url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~lngbrain/cglidden/temporal.html|work=Langbrain|publisher=Rice University|accessdate=2 January 2011}}</ref>

The temporal lobes are involved in the retention of [[Visual memory|visual memories]], processing sensory input, [[language comprehension|comprehending language]], storing new memories, emotion, and deriving meaning.<ref name=smith07>{{cite book|last=Smith|last2=Kosslyn|title=Cognitive Psychology: Mind and Brain|year=2007|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|pages=21, 194–199, 349}}</ref>{{rp|21|date=December 2012}}

==Functions==
===Visual memories===
The temporal lobe contains the [[hippocampus]] and plays a key role in the formation of explicit [[long-term memory]] modulated by the [[amygdala]].<ref name=smith07 />{{rp|349|date=December 2012}}

===Processing sensory input===
;Auditory: Adjacent areas in the superior, posterior, and lateral parts of the temporal lobes are involved in high-level auditory processing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} The temporal lobe is involved in primary [[Hearing (sense)|auditory]] perception, such as hearing, and holds the [[primary auditory cortex]].<ref name=schacter10>{{cite book|first=Daniel L.|last= Schacter|first2= Daniel T.|last2= Gilbert|first3= Daniel M. |last3=Wegner|title=Psychology|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9781429237192|edition=2nd}}{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> The [[primary auditory cortex]] receives sensory information from the ears and secondary areas process the information into meaningful units such as speech and words. <ref name="schacter10" /> The [[superior temporal gyrus]] includes an area (within the lateral fissure) where auditory signals from the [[cochlea]] first reach the [[cerebral cortex]] and are processed by the primary auditory cortex in the left temporal lobe.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

;Visual: The areas associated with vision in the temporal lobe interpret the meaning of visual stimuli and establish object recognition.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}  The [[ventral]] part of the temporal cortices appear to be involved in high-level visual processing of complex stimuli such as [[face perception|faces]] ([[fusiform gyrus]]) and scenes ([[parahippocampal gyrus]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Anterior parts of this [[ventral stream]] for [[visual processing]] are involved in object perception and recognition.<ref name="schacter10" />

===Language comprehension===
The left temporal lobe holds the [[primary auditory cortex]], which is important for the processing of [[semantics]] in both speech and [[Visual perception|vision]] in humans.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} [[Wernicke's area]], which spans the region between temporal and parietal lobes, plays a key role (in tandem with [[Broca's area]] in the [[frontal lobe]]) in speech comprehension.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} The functions of the left temporal lobe are not limited to low-level perception but extend to comprehension, naming, [[verbal memory]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===New memories===
{{see also|Emotion and memory}}
The medial temporal lobes (near the [[sagittal plane]]) are thought to be involved in [[Encoding_(memory)|encoding]] [[Declarative memory|declarative]] [[Long-term_memory|long term memory]].<ref name=smith07 />{{rp|194–199|date=December 2012}} The medial temporal lobes include the [[hippocampus|hippocampi]], which are essential for memory storage, therefore damage to this area can result in impairment in new memory formation leading to permanent or temporary [[anterograde amnesia]].<ref name=smith07 />{{rp|194–199|date=December 2012}}

==Medial temporal lobe==

The medial temporal lobe consists of structures that are vital for declarative or long-term memory. [[Declarative_memory|Declarative]] (denotative) or [[Explicit_memory|explicit]] memory is conscious memory divided into [[semantic memory]] (facts) and [[episodic memory]] (events).<ref name=smith07 />{{rp|194|date=December 2012}} Medial temporal lobe structures that are critical for long-term memory include the [[amygdala]], [[brainstem]], and hippocampus, along with the surrounding [[Hippocampal_formation|hippocampal region]] consisting of the [[Perirhinal_cortex|perirhinal]], [[Parahippocampal_gyrus|parahippocampal]], and [[Entorhinal_cortex|entorhinal]] neocortical regions.<ref name=smith07 />{{rp|196|date=December 2012}} The hippocampus is critical for memory formation, and the surrounding medial temporal cortex is currently theorized to be critical for memory storage.<ref name=smith07 />{{rp|21|date=December 2012}} The [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] and visual cortices are also involved in explicit memory.<ref name=smith07 />{{rp|21|date=December 2012}}

Research has shown that lesions in the hippocampus of monkeys results in limited impairment of function, whereas extensive lesions that include the hippocampus and the medial temporal cortex result in severe impairment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Squire|first=LR|last2=Stark|first2=CE|last3=Clark|first3= RE|title=The medial temporal lobe|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|date=2004|volume=27|pages=279–306|pmid=15217334|url=http://whoville.ucsd.edu/PDFs/383_Squire_etal_%20AnnRevNeurosci2004.pdf|doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144130}}</ref>
