[[Levi Cooper Lane]] was a physician and surgeon in San Francisco in the 1800s. He served on the faculty of the Medical Department of the College of the Pacific, which was the first medical school on the Pacific Coast, founded in 1858 by Lane's uncle [[Elias Samuel Cooper]]. After Cooper's death in 1862 the medical school stopped operating. In 1870 Lane revived it, became president, and renamed it Medical College of the Pacific. In 1882 he changed the name to Cooper Medical College, named for his uncle, its founder. He built with his own funds a new brick medical school building at the corner of Sacramento and Webster streets, which served continuously as a medical school from 1882 until 1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap1/chap1-sect3.html|title=The Advent of Cooper Medical College (1870-1912)|work=eLane|publisher=Lane Library|accessdate=25 August 2012}}</ref> He also built an adjacent hospital and nursing school, and made provision in his will for the construction of a library across the street from the college.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilbur|first1=Ray Lyman|last2=Carroll|first2=Paul|title=The Memoirs of Ray Lyman Wilbur, 1875-1949|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=N1ejAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80&dq=%22lane+medical+library%22&source=bl&ots=TJ0d1Iegsh&sig=V2mAXtP1N3N6U3b7ru1Bcxkwbpg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=jTo5UNrDLIrDygH1jIGwCg&ved=0CFkQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=%22lane%20medical%20library%22&f=false|pages=79–80}}</ref>
