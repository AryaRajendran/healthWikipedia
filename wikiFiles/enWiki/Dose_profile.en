In External Beam [[Radiotherapy]], transverse and longitudinal '''dose measurements''' are taken by a radiation detector in order to characterise the radiation beams from medical [[linear accelerators]]. Typically, an [[ionisation chamber]] and water phantom are used to create these radiation dose profiles. [[Water]] is used due to its tissue equivalence.

Transverse dose measurements are performed in the x (crossplane) or y (inplane) directions perpendicular to the radiation beam, and at a given depth (z) in the phantom. These are known dose profiles.
Dose measurements taken along the z direction create radiation dose distribution known as a depth-dose curve.
