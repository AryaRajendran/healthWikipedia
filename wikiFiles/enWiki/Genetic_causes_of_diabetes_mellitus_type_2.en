Various hereditary conditions may feature diabetes, for example [[myotonic dystrophy]] and [[Friedreich's ataxia]]. [[Wolfram's syndrome]] is an [[autosomal recessive]] [[neurodegenerative disorder]] that first becomes evident in childhood. It consists of diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness, hence the acronym DIDMOAD.<ref name="AMN">{{cite journal |author=Barrett TG|title=Mitochondrial diabetes, DIDMOAD and other inherited diabetes syndromes |journal=Best Practice & Research.

While obesity is an independent risk factor for type&nbsp;2 diabetes that may be linked to lifestyle, obesity is also a trait that may be strongly inherited.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Walley AJ, Blakemore AI, Froguel P |title=Genetics of obesity and the prediction of risk for health |journal=Human Molecular Genetics |volume=15 Spec No 2 |issue= |pages=R124–30 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=16987875|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddl215}}</ref>  Other research also shows that type 2 diabetes can cause obesity as an effect of the changes in metabolism and other deranged cell behavior attendant on insulin resistance.<ref name=IntJObes.1999-Camastra>{{cite journal |author=Camastra S, Bonora E, Del Prato S, Rett K, Weck M, Ferrannini E |title=Effect of obesity and insulin resistance on resting and glucose-induced thermogenesis in man.

However, environmental factors (almost certainly diet and weight) play a large part in the development of type 2 diabetes in addition to any genetic component.  Genetic risk for type 2 diabetes changes as humans first began migrating around the world, implying a strong environmental component has affected the genetic-basis of type 2 diabetes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Corona|first=Erik|title=Geneworld|url=geneworld.stanford.edu|work=World Wide Patterns of Genetic Risk for Disease|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Gibbons|first=Ann|title=Diabetes Genes Decline Out of Africa|journal=Science|date=4|year=2011|month=November|volume=334|issue=6056|pages=583|doi=10.1126/science.334.6056.583|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/6056/583.full}}</ref> This can be seen from the adoption of the type 2 diabetes epidemiological pattern in those who have moved to a different environment as compared to the same genetic pool who have not.   Immigrants to Western developed countries, for instance, may be more prone to diabetes as compared to its lower incidence in their countries of origins.<ref>Cotran, Kumar, Collins; '''Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease,'''Saunders Sixth Edition, 1999; 913-926.</ref> Such developments can also be found in environments which have had a recent increase in social wealth, increasingly common throughout Asia.
