'''Feulgen stain''' is a [[staining]] technique discovered by [[Robert Feulgen]] and used in [[histology]] to identify [[chromosome|chromosomal material]] or [[DNA]] in cell specimens. It depends on acid [[hydrolysis]] of DNA, therefore fixating agents using [[strong acid]]s should be avoided.

The specimen is subjected to warm (60 °C) [[hydrochloric acid]], then to [[Schiff reagent]]. In the past, a [[potassium metabisulfite|sulfite]] rinse followed, but this is now considered unnecessary. Optionally, the sample can be [[counterstain]]ed with [[Light Green SF yellowish]]. Finally, it is dehydrated with [[ethanol]], cleared with [[xylene]], and mounted in a [[resin]]ous medium.

[[DNA]] should be stained red. The background, if counterstained, is green.

The Feulgen reaction is a semi-quantitative technique. If the only aldehydes remaining in the cell are those produced from the [[hydrolysis]] of [[DNA]], then the technique is quantitative for [[DNA]]. It is possible to use an instrument known as a [[microdensitometer]] or [[microspectrophotometer]] to actually measure the intensity of the pink Feulgen reaction for a given [[organelle]]. Using this procedure, it was early determined that interphase cells were composed of two populations, those with [[diploid]] [[DNA]] and those with [[tetraploid]] [[DNA]] (two complete genomes). The nuclei looked identical, but one contained twice as much DNA. This gave rise to the division of the interphase period of the [[cell cycle]] to G1, S, and G2 phases based on the synthesis of that extra DNA.[http://homepages.gac.edu/~cellab/chpts/chpt2/ex2-5.html]
