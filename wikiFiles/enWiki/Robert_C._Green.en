'''Robert C. Green''' is a researcher in clinical genetics at the Division of Genetics and Department of Medicine at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] and [[Harvard Medical School]] working in  translational genomics and the integration of [[personal genomics]] into clinical practice. His research includes the return of [[incidental findings]] in clinical settings, and topics in [[Alzheimer's disease]], including the development of risk estimates based on family history and genetic markers and the return of these risk factors to patients.<ref>Green, R.C., et al.
