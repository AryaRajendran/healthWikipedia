The '''European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership''' or '''EDCTP''' is a partnership between the [[European Union]] (EU), [[Norway]], [[Switzerland]] and developing countries and other donors, as well as the [[pharmaceutical industry]], to enable [[clinical trials]] and the development of new medicines and [[vaccine]]s against [[HIV|HIV/AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]].[http://ec.europa.eu/research/info/conferences/edctp/edctp_en.html] The need for global action against these diseases in order to promote poverty reduction has been recognised by the [[United Nations]], the [[G8]], and the [[African Union]], and the program envisioned the provision of €600 million for the period 2003-2007 in order to translate medical research results into clinical applications relevant to the needs of developing countries.

The [[European Council]] adopted the '''Programme for Action: Accelerated action on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in the context of poverty reduction''' (COM (2001)96, [http://ec.europa.eu/research/info/conferences/edctp/pdf/com-2001-96_final_en.pdf]) on 15 May 2001, following its launch by the [[European Commission]]. The [[European Commission|Commission]] proposal was adopted on 16 June 2003 by the [[European Council|Council]] and the [[European Parliament]].[http://europa.eu/eur-lex/pri/en/oj/dat/2003/l_169/l_16920030708en00010005.pdf] The Programme was to be based on three central pillars: ''"...the impact of existing interventions, the affordability of key pharmaceuticals and trade, and the research and development of specific [[global public good]]s."''[http://ec.europa.eu/research/info/conferences/edctp/pdf/background_en.pdf] These aims relate specifically with the [[European Union|EU]] stance on access to [[essential medicines]].

==Projects and activities==

EDCTP-funded activities are based on:

* North/North networking and co-ordination

Partnerships among the [[European Union|EU]] and associated countries, allowing focused collaboration of national and European efforts that were not previously coordinated.

* North/South networking and co-ordination

Partnerships among [[European Union|EU]] and developing countries that focuses specifically on developing countries' needs, who are jointly involved in setting the research priorities.

* South/South networking and co-ordination

Efforts aimed at creating lasting long-term partnerships between African scientists and research institutions in Africa.

* Supporting relevant clinical trials

Acceleration of the development of new or improved drugs, vaccines and microbicides against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, with a focus on phase II and III clinical trials in sub-Saharan Africa.

* Capacity building

Manifested as a general strengthening of clinical research capacity in Africa, including training activities, workshops and meetings, and the upgrading of [[clinical trials|clinical trial]] sites in Africa.

The total budget of the EDCTP is €600 million for the period 2003-2007, of which one third (€200 million) is to be provided by the [[European Union|EU]] budget, an equivalent amounts from Member States' activities, and the remaining €200 million from industry, charities, and private organisations. The Partnership is intended to be a long-term initiative (10–20 years) and a separate legal entity has been created to maintain its independence and flexibility.

Taken together, clinical trials based in developing countries where the diseases are endemic, capacity building, and South-South networking are expected to make up over 90% of the overall budget. (figure).
