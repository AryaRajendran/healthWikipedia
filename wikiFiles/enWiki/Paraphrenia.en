'''Paraphrenia''' is a [[mental disorder]] characterized by an organized system of [[paranoid delusions]] with or without [[hallucinations]] (the [[positive symptoms]] of [[schizophrenia]]) without deterioration of intellect or personality (its negative symptoms). <ref name="Almeida">Almeida, O. P., Howard, H. F., & Levy, R.  (1992).  Late paraphrenia: a review.  ''International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, 7'', 543-548.  </ref> <ref name="Roth, 1955">Roth, M.  (1955).

Paraphrenia is not included in either the [[DSM-IV]] or the [[ICD-10]]; psychotherapists often diagnose patients presenting with paraphrenia as having atypical psychoses, [[delusional disorder]], psychoses not otherwise specified, [[schizoaffective disorders]], and persistent persecutory states of older adults.<ref name="Casanova, 2010"/>  Recently therapists have also been classifying paraphrenia as very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis.<ref name="Casanova, 2010"/>  

==Symptoms==
The main symptoms of paraphrenia are [[paranoid delusions]] and [[hallucinations]].<ref name="Almeida"/> <ref name="Kayroth, 1961">Kay, D. W., & Roth, M.  (1961).  Environmental and hereditary factors in schizophrenias of old-age (late paraphrenia) and their bearing on general problem of causation in schizophrenia.  ''Journal of Mental Science, 107'', 649.  </ref>  The delusions often involve the individual being the subject of persecution, although they can also be [[eroticism|erotic]], [[Hypochondriasis|hypochondriacal]], or [[grandiosity|grandiose]] in nature.  The majority of hallucinations associated with paraphrenia are auditory, with 75% of patients reporting such an experience; however, visual, tactile, and olfactory hallucinations have also been reported.<ref name="Kayroth, 1961"/> <ref name="Almeida"/>  The [[paranoia]] and hallucinations can combine in the form of “threatening or accusatory voices coming from neighbouring houses [and] are frequently reported by the patients as disturbing and undeserved".<ref name="Almeida"/>  Patients also present with a lack of symptoms commonly found in other mental disorders similar to paraphrenia.  There is no significant deterioration of intellect, personality, or habits and patients often remain clean and mostly self-sufficient.<ref name="Kayroth, 1961"/>  Patients also remain oriented well in time and space.<ref name="Almeida"/> 

Paraphrenia is different from schizophrenia because, while both disorders result in delusions and hallucinations, individuals with schizophrenia exhibit changes and deterioration of personality whereas individuals with paraphrenia maintain a well-preserved personality and affective response. <ref name="Roth, 1955"/><ref name="Kayroth, 1961"/>

==Possible Causes==

===Neurological===
Paraphrenia is often associated with a physical change in the brain, such as a [[tumor]], [[stroke]], [[ventricular enlargement]], or [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative process]].<ref name="Casanova, 2010"/>   Research that reviewed the relationship between [[lesion|organic brain lesions]] and the development of delusions suggested that "brain lesions which lead to subcortical dysfunction could produce delusions when elaborated by an intact cortex." <ref name="Cummings">Cummings, J. L. (1985).  Organic delusions: Phenomenology, anatomical correlations, and review.  ''British Journal of Psychiatry, 146'', 184-197.  </ref>
===Predisposing Factors===
Many patients who present with paraphrenia have significant auditory or visual loss, are socially isolated with a lack of social contact, do not have a permanent home, are unmarried and without children, and have [[adaptive behavior|maladaptive personality traits]]. <ref name="Herbert">Herbert, M. E., & Jacobson, S.  (1967).  Late paraphrenia.  ''British Journal of Psychiatry, 113'', 461.</ref> <ref name="Ravindran"> Ravindran, A. V., Yatham, L. N., & Munro, A.  (1999).  Paraphrenia redefined.  ''Canadian Journal of Psychiatry-Revue Canadienne De Psychiatrie, 44'', 133-137. </ref> <ref name="Casanova, 2010"/>While these factors do not cause paraphrenia, they do make individuals more likely to develop the disorder later in life.  

==Diagnosis==
While the diagnosis of paraphrenia is not currently included in the [[DSM-IV]] or the [[ICD-10]], many studies have recognized the condition as "a viable diagnostic entity that is distinct from schizophrenia, with organic factors playing a role in a significant portion of patients."<ref name="Casanova, 2010"/>  As such, paraphrenia is seen as being distinct from both schizophrenia and [[dementia|progressive dementia]] in old age.<ref name="Roth, 1955"/>  Ravindran (1999) developed a list of criteria for the diagnosis of paraphrenia, which agrees with much of the research done up to the time it was published.
:1.  A delusional disorder of at least 6 months duration characterized by the following:
::a.  Preoccupation with one or more semisystematized delusions, often accompanied by auditory hallucinations.
::b.  Affect notably well-preserved and appropriate.  Ability to maintain rapport with others.
::c.  None of
:::i.  Intellectual deterioration
:::ii. Visual hallucinations
:::iii. Incoherence
:::iv. Flat or grossly inappropriate affect
:::v. Grossly disorganized behavior at times other than during the acute episode.
::d.  Distrubance of behavior understandable in relation to the content of the delusions and hallucinations.
::e. Only partly meets [[Schizophrenia#Diagnosis|criterion A for schizophrenia]].  No significant organic brain disorder.

==Management==
Research suggests that paraphrenics respond well to [[antipsychotic|antipsychotic drug therapy]] if doctors can successfully achieve sufficient compliance.<ref name="Almeida"/> <ref name="Ravindran"/>  Herbert found that [[Stelazine]] combined with [[Disipal]] was an effective treatment.  It promoted the discharging of patients and kept discharged patients from being readmitted later.<ref name="Herbert"/>  While [[behavior therapy]] may help patients reduce their preoccupation with delusions, psychotherapy is not currently of primary value.<ref name="Ravindran"/>

==Prognosis==
Individuals who develop paraphrenia have a life expectancy similar to the normal population. <ref name="Casanova, 2010"/> <ref name="Rothkay, 1998">Roth, M., & Kay, D. W. K.  (1998).  Late paraphrenia:  A variant of schizophrenia manifest in late life or an organic clinical syndrome?  A review of recent evidence.  International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, 13, 775-784.</ref><ref name="Almeida"/><ref name="Roth, 1955"/>  Recovery from the psychotic symptoms seems to be rare, and in most cases paraphrenia results in in-patient status for the remainder of the life of the patient. <ref name="Almeida"/><ref name="Herbert"/><ref name="Roth, 1955"/>  Patients experience a slow deterioration of cognitive functions and the disorder can lead to dementia in some cases, but this development is no greater than the normal population. <ref name="Casanova, 2010"/><ref name="Kayroth, 1961"/><ref name="Roth, 1955"/>  

==Epidemiology==
Studies suggest that the prevalence of paraphrenia in the elderly population is around 2-4%.<ref name="Almeida"/>
===Sex Differences===
While paraphrenia can occur in both men and women, it is more common in women, even after the difference has been adjusted for life expectancies.<ref name="Almeida"/>  The ratio of women with paraphrenia to men with paraphrenia is anywhere from 3:1 to 45:2<ref name="Almeida,1995">Almeida, O. P., Howard, R. J., Levy, R., & David, A. S. (1995). Psychotic states arising in late life (late paraphrenia): The role of risk factors. ''British Journal of Psychiatry, 166'', 215-228</ref>
===Age===
It is seen mainly in patients over the age of 60, but has been known to occur in patients in their 40s and 50s. <ref name="Roth, 1955"/><ref name="Almeida,1995"/>
===Personality Type and Living Situation===
It is suggested that individuals who develop paraphrenia later in life have [[premorbidity|premorbid personalities]], and can be described as “quarrelsome, religious, suspicious or sensitive, unsociable and cold-hearted.”<ref name="Almeida"/> Many patients were also described as being solitary, eccentric, isolated and difficult individuals; these characteristics were also long-standing rather than introduced by the disorder. <ref name="Kayroth, 1961"/>  Most of the traits recognized prior to the onset of paraphrenia in individuals can be grouped as either paranoid or schizoid.<ref name="Herbert"/>  Patients presenting with paraphrenia were most often found to be living by themselves (either single, widowed, or divorced).<ref name="Herbert"/>  There have also been reports of low marriage rate among paraphrenics and these individuals also have few or no children (possibly because of this premorbid personality). <ref name="Almeida"/><ref name="Herbert"/><ref name="Almeida,1995"/>
===Physical Factors===
The development of paranoia and hallucinations in old age have been related to both auditory and visual impairment, and individuals with paraphrenia often present with one or both of these impairments.<ref name="Almeida"/><ref name="Herbert"/><ref name="Almeida,1995"/> Hearing loss in paraphrenics is associated with early age of onset, long duration, and profound auditory loss. <ref name="Almeida,1995"/>

==History==
The term ''paraphrenia'' was originally popularized by [[Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum]] in 1863 to describe the tendency of certain [[mental disorder|psychiatric disorders]] to occur during certain  transitional periods in life (describing paraphrenia hebetica as the [[insanity]] of the adolescence and paraphrenia senilis as the insanity of the elders.<ref name="Casanova, 2010"/><ref name="McKenna">{{cite book|author=McKenna, P.J.|title=Schizophrenia and related syndromes|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vNK46FMFa-oC&pg=PA239|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-86377-790-5|pages=239–242}}</ref>  

The term was also used by [[Emil Kraepelin]] in 1919, who changed its meaning to describe paraphrenia as it is understood today, as a small group of individuals that have many of the symptoms of schizophrenia with a lack of deterioration and thought disorder.<ref name="Casanova, 2010"/><ref name="McKenna"/>  Kraepelin's study was discredited by Wilhelm Mayer in 1921 when he conducted a follow-up study using Kraepelin's data.  His study suggested that there was little to no discrimination between schizophrenia and paraphrenia; given enough time, patients presenting with paraphrenia will merge into the schizophrenic pool.<ref name="Casanova, 2010"/><ref name="McKenna"/>  However, in 1952, Roth and Morrissey conducted a large study in which they surveyed the mental hospital admissions of older patients.  They characterized patients as having "paraphrenic delusions which… occurred in each case in the setting of a well-preserved intellect and personality, were often ‘primary’ in character, and were usually associated with the passivity failings or other volitional disturbances and hallucinations in clear consciousness pathognomonic of schizophrenia".<ref name="RothMorrissey, 1952">Roth, M. & Morrissey, J. D. (1952) Problems in the diagnosis and classification of mental disorders in old age. ''The Journal of Mental Science, 98'', 66–80.</ref><ref name="Casanova, 2010"/>  

In recent medicine, the term ''paraphrenia'' has been replaced by the diagnosis of "very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis" and has also been called "atypical psychoses, delusional disorder, psychoses not otherwise specified, schizoaffective disorders, and persistent persecutory states of older adults" by psychotherapists.<ref name="Casanova, 2010"/> Current studies, however, recognize the condition as "a viable diagnostic entity that is distinct from schizophrenia, with organic factors playing a role in a significant portion of patients."<ref name="Casanova, 2010"/>
