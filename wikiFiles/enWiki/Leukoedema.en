'''Leukoedema''' (also termed '''leucoedema''')<ref>{{cite book|last=Scully|first=Crispian|title=Oral and maxillofacial medicine : the basis of diagnosis and treatment|year=2008|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780443068188|pages=388|edition=2nd ed.}}</ref> is a blue, grey or white appearance of [[mucous membrane|mucosa]]e, particularly the [[Oral mucosa#|buccal mucosa]] (the inside of the cheeks), but may also occur on the mucosa of the [[larynx]] or vagina. It is a harmless and very common condition. Because it is so common, it has been argued that it may in fact represent a variation of the normal appearance rather than a disease,<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> but [[empirical evidence]] suggests that leukoedema is an [[acquired disease|acquired condition]] caused by local irritation.<ref name="Martin 1992" /> It is found more commonly in black skinned people and in those who smoke. The term is derived from the Greek words leuko-, "white" and οἴδημα—oídēma, "swelling". 

==Signs and symptoms==
There is a diffuse, gray-white, milky opalescent appearance of the mucosa which usually occurs bilaterally on the buccal mucosa.<!-- <ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> --> Less often, the labial mucosa, the palate or the [[floor of mouth]] may be affected.<!-- <ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> --> The surface of the area is folded, creating a wrinkled, white streaked lesion.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> Apart from the appearance, the lesion is entirely asymptomatic.<ref name="Martin 1992" /> 

==Causes==
The cause is unknown,<ref name="OMF pathology textbook">{{cite book|last=Bouquot|first=Brad W. Neville , Douglas D. Damm, Carl M. Allen, Jerry E.|title=Oral & maxillofacial pathology|year=2002|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0721690033|pages=7–8|edition=2. ed.}}</ref> but it is thought to be caused by intracellular edema of the superficial epithelial cells coupled with retention of superficial parakeratin.  Although leukoedema is thought to be a developmental condition, it may be more common and more pronounced in smokers, and becomes less noticeable when smoking is stopped.<!-- <ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> --> Smoking [[canabis]] is known to be linked to this condition.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Versteeg|first=PA|coauthors=Slot, DE; van der Velden, U; van der Weijden, GA|title=Effect of cannabis usage on the oral environment: a review.|journal=International journal of dental hygiene|date=2008 Nov|volume=6|issue=4|pages=315–20|pmid=19138182}}</ref> It may also develop in areas subjecte to repeat subclinical irritation, caused by low grade irritants such as spices, oral debris or tobacco.<ref name="Martin 1992" />

==Diagnosis==
Leukoedema lesions disappear when the mucosa is stretched, which helps to differentiate it from other white lesions in the mouth.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> The [[differential diagnosis]] is with [[leukoplakia]], [[oral candidiasis]], oral [[lichen planus]], [[white sponge nevus]], [[morsicatio buccarum]],<ref name="Martin 1992" /> hereditary benign intraepithelial dyskeratosis and dyskeratosis congenita. Tissue [[biopsy]] is not indicated, but when taken, the [[histology|histologic]] appearance is one of [[acanthosis|increased epithelial thickness]], broadening and eleongation of the [[Rete pegs|rete ridges]], [[parakeratosis]] and [[Hydropic swell|intracellular edema]] of the [[Stratum spinosum|spinous layer]]. The cells of the spinous later are [[Vacuole|vacuolated]], large and possess [[Pyknosis|pyknotic nuclei]].<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> The superficial [[squamous cell]]s have a clear, seemingly empty [[cytoplasm]] but it has not been shown that there is an increase in intracellular water, possibly making the term [[edema]] misleading. The histologic appearance is thought to be caused by water within the cells of the spinous layer causing the light to reflect back as whitish. The diagnosis is usually made based on the clinical appearance alone, but oral [[exfoliative cytology]] has been used as a diagnostic aid.<ref name="Martin 1992" />

==Treatment and prognosis==
Leukoedema is a harmless condition, and no treatment is indicated.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> People may be alarmed by the appearance and benefit from reassurance.

==Epidemiology==
Leukoedema is common.<!-- <ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> --> It occurs in about 70-90% of black skinned adults and about 50% of black skinned children.<!-- <ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> --> The prevalence in white skinned people is considerably less, but reports range from less than 10% to more than 90%, probably varying depending upon the population studied, and the methods used in the study, e.g. examination conditions and the diagnostic criteria.<!-- <ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> --> The ethnic variation may be explained by genetic etiologic factors or simply because black skinned people have greater amount of [[melanin]] in the mucosa, making it appear darker (termed racial or physiologic pigmentation).<!-- <ref name="OMF pathology textbook" /> --> This darker mucosa may make the edematous changes more noticeable, whereas in the mucosa of people with lighter skin types leukoedema gives a milder presentation.<ref name="OMF pathology textbook" />

==History==
Leukoedema was once thought to be a precursor lesion to leukoplakia, and was not believed to occur in children,<ref name="Martin 1992">{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=JL|title=Leukoedema: a review of the literature.|journal=Journal of the National Medical Association|date=1992 Nov|volume=84|issue=11|pages=938–40|pmid=1460680|pmc=2571748}}</ref> but both of these views are now disproved.
