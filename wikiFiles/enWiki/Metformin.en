'''Metformin''' ([[British Pharmacopoeia|BP]], pronounced {{IPAc-en|m|ɛ|t|ˈ|f|ɔr|m|ɨ|n}}, {{respell|met|FAWR|min}}; originally sold as '''Glucophage''') is an oral [[antidiabetic drug]] in the [[biguanide]] class. It is the [[first-line treatment|first-line]] drug of choice for the treatment of [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], in particular, in [[overweight]] and [[obesity|obese]] people and those with normal kidney function.<ref>Clinical Guidelines Task Force, [[International Diabetes Federation]] (2005). {{PDFlink|[http://www.idf.org/webdata/docs/GGT2D%2009%20Oral%20therapy.pdf "Glucose control: oral therapy"]|100&nbsp;KB}}.

It is also used in the treatment of [[polycystic ovary syndrome]], and has been investigated for other diseases where [[insulin resistance]] may be an important factor. Metformin works by suppressing glucose production by the liver.

Metformin is the only antidiabetic drug that has been conclusively shown to prevent the cardiovascular complications of diabetes. It helps reduce [[low-density lipoprotein|LDL cholesterol]] and [[triglyceride]] levels, and is not associated with weight gain. {{As of|2010}}, metformin is one of only two oral antidiabetics in the [[World Health Organization Model List of Essential Medicines]] (the other being [[glibenclamide]]).<ref name=WHOessential>(March 2010) {{PDFlink|[http://www.who.int/entity/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/Updated_sixteenth_adult_list_en.pdf ''WHO Model List of Essential Medicines'']|433&nbsp;KB}}, 16th edition, [[World Health Organization]], p. 24. Retrieved December 22, 2010.</ref>

When prescribed appropriately, metformin causes few [[adverse drug reaction|adverse effects]] (the most common is gastrointestinal upset) and is associated with a low risk of [[hypoglycemia]]. [[Lactic acidosis]] (a buildup of [[lactic acid|lactate]] in the blood) can be a serious concern in [[overdose]] and when it is prescribed to people with [[contraindication]]s, but otherwise, there is no [[statistical significance|significant]] risk.

First [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] and found to reduce blood sugar in the 1920s, metformin was forgotten for the next two decades as research shifted to [[insulin]] and other antidiabetic drugs. Interest in metformin was rekindled in the late 1940s after several reports that it could reduce blood sugar levels in people, and in 1957, French physician Jean Sterne published the first [[clinical trial]] of metformin as a treatment for diabetes. It was introduced to the United Kingdom in 1958, Canada in 1972, and the United States in 1995. Metformin is now believed to be the most widely prescribed antidiabetic drug in the world; in the United States alone, more than 48 million prescriptions were filled in 2010 for its [[generic drug|generic formulations]].<ref name=Bailey/><ref name=Top200Generics>{{PDFlink|[http://www.imshealth.com/deployedfiles/imshealth/Global/Content/IMS%20Institute/Static%20File/IHII_UseOfMed_report.pdf "The Use of Medicines in the United States: Review of 2010"]|1.79&nbsp;MB}}.

===Type 2 diabetes===
The main use for metformin is in the treatment of [[diabetes mellitus]] type 2, especially in [[overweight]] people. In this group, over 10 years of treatment, metformin reduced diabetes complications and overall mortality by about 30% when compared with [[insulin]] and [[sulfonylurea]]s ([[glibenclamide]] and [[chlorpropamide]]) and by about 40% when compared with the group only given dietary advice.<ref name = UKPDS/> This difference held in people who were followed up for five to 10 years after the study.<ref name="pmid18784090">{{vcite journal |author=Holman RR, Paul SK, Bethel MA, Matthews DR, Neil HA |title=10-year follow-up of intensive glucose control in type 2 diabetes |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=359 |issue=15 |pages=1577–89 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18784090 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0806470 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/359/15/1577}}</ref> Since intensive glucose control with metformin appears to decrease the risk of diabetes-related endpoints in overweight people with diabetes, and is associated with less weight gain and fewer hypoglycaemic attacks than are insulin and sulphonylureas, it may be the first-line pharmacological therapy of choice in this group. In addition, metformin had no effect on body weight: Over the 10-year treatment period, the metformin group gained about 1&nbsp;kg, the same as the dietary advice group, while the sulfonylureas group gained 3&nbsp;kg, and the insulin group, 6&nbsp;kg.<ref name = UKPDS>{{vcite journal |title=Effect of intensive blood-glucose control with metformin on complications in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes (UKPDS 34).

===Prediabetes===
Metformin treatment of people at risk for type 2 diabetes may decrease their chances of developing the disease, although intensive physical exercise and dieting work significantly better for this purpose. In a large U.S. study known as the Diabetes Prevention Program, participants were divided into groups and given either placebo, metformin, or lifestyle intervention, and followed for an average of three years. The intensive program of lifestyle modifications included a 16-lesson training on dieting and exercise followed by monthly individualized sessions with the goals to decrease the body weight by 7% and engage in a physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week. The [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of diabetes was 58% lower in the lifestyle group and 31% lower in those given metformin. Among younger people with a higher body mass index, lifestyle modification was no more effective than metformin, and for older individuals with a lower body mass index, metformin was no better than placebo in preventing diabetes.<ref name=DPP>{{vcite journal |author=Knowler WC, Barrett-Connor E, Fowler SE, ''et al.'' |author.= |title=Reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes with lifestyle intervention or metformin |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=346 |issue=6 |pages=393–403 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11832527 |pmc=1370926 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa012512}}</ref> After ten years, the incidence of diabetes was 34% lower in the group of participants given diet and exercise and 18% lower in those given metformin.<ref name=DPP10>{{vcite journal |author=Knowler WC, Fowler SE, Hamman RF, ''et al.'' |author.= |title=10-year follow-up of diabetes incidence and weight loss in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study |journal=Lancet |volume=374 |issue=9702 |pages=1677–86 |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19878986 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61457-4 |pmc=3135022}}</ref> It is unclear whether metformin slowed down the progression of prediabetes to diabetes (true preventive effect), or the decrease of diabetes in the treated population was simply due to its glucose-lowering action (treatment effect).<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Lilly M, Godwin M |title=Treating prediabetes with metformin: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=363–9 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19366942 |pmc=2669003}}</ref>

The risk of pancreatic cancer in study participants having taken metformin was found to be 62% lower than in participants never having taken it, whereas participants who had used insulin or [[secretagogue]]s (such as the sulfonylureas) were found to have a 5-fold and 2.5-fold higher risk of pancreatic cancer, respectively, compared to participants that had been treated with neither.<ref name=Li>{{vcite journal |author=Li D, Yeung SC, Hassan MM, Konopleva M, Abbruzzese JL |title=Antidiabetic therapies affect risk of pancreatic cancer |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=137 |issue=2 |pages=482–8 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19375425 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2009.04.013 | url=http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085%2809%2900555-1/fulltext |laysummary=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/707523 |laysource=Medscape |laydate=August 18, 2009}}</ref> The study had several limitations, however, and the reason for this risk reduction is still unclear.<ref name=Li/> Observational studies conducted by the [[University of Dundee]] have shown a decrease of 25–37% in cancer cases in diabetics taking metformin.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Evans JM, Donnelly LA, Emslie-Smith AM, Alessi DR, Morris AD |year=2005 |title=Metformin and reduced risk of cancer of 25–37% in diabetic patients |journal=BMJ |volume=330 |pages=1304–5 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7503/1304 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38415.708634.F7 |pmid=15849206 |pmc=558205 }}</ref><ref>{{vcite journal |author=Libby G, Donnelly LA, Donnan PT, Alessi DR, Morris AD, Evans JM |year=2009 |title=New users of metformin are at low risk of incident cancer: a cohort study among people with type 2 diabetes |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=32 |pages=1620–5 |url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/32/9/1620.full |doi=10.2337/dc08-2175 |pmid=19564453 |pmc=2732153 }}</ref> Several epidemiological and case-controlled studies found diabetics using metformin may have lower cancer risk in comparison to those using other antidiabetic medications.

Metformin is recommended to be temporarily discontinued before any [[medical imaging|radiographic study]] involving [[iodine|iodinated]] [[radiocontrast|contrast]] agents, (such as a contrast-enhanced [[computed tomography|CT scan]] or [[angiogram]]), as the contrast dye may temporarily impair kidney function, indirectly leading to lactic acidosis by causing retention of metformin in the body.<!--really the main mechanism?--><ref name="RCR">Weir J (March 19, 1999).

==Adverse effects==

===Gastrointestinal===
In a clinical trial of 286 subjects, 53.2% of the 141 given immediate-release metformin (as opposed to [[placebo]]) reported diarrhea, versus 11.7% for placebo, and 25.5% reported nausea/vomiting, versus 8.3% for those on placebo.<ref name = DF&C>{{vcite book |title=Drug Facts and Comparisons 2005 |year=2004 |month=October |publisher=Facts and Comparisons |location=St. Louis, Mo |isbn=1-57439-193-3 }}</ref>

Gastrointestinal upset can cause severe discomfort; it is most common when metformin is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1 to 1.7&nbsp;grams per day) and increasing the dose gradually. Gastrointestinal upset after prolonged, steady use is less common.{{citation needed | date=March 2011}}

Lactate uptake by the liver is diminished with metformin administration because lactate is a substrate for hepatic [[gluconeogenesis]], a process that metformin inhibits. In healthy individuals, this slight excess is simply cleared by other mechanisms (including uptake by the kidneys, when their function is unimpaired), and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs.<ref name=Umesh>{{vcite book |author=Maharani U |editor=Papadakis MA, McPhee SJ |chapter=Chapter 27: Diabetes Mellitus & Hypoglycemia |title=CURRENT Medical Diagnosis and Treatment 2010 |edition=49th |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location= |year=2009 |pages=1092–93 |isbn=0-07-162444-9}}</ref> When there is impaired renal function, however, clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced, leading to increased levels of both, and possibly causing lactic acidosis due to a buildup of lactic acid. Because metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication to its use. Common causes of increased lactic acid production include [[alcoholism]] (due to depletion of [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD+]] stores), heart failure, and respiratory disease (due to inadequate oxygenation of tissues); the most common cause of impaired lactic acid excretion is kidney disease.<ref name=Golan>{{vcite book |author=Shu AD, Myers Jr MG, Shoelson SE |editor=Golan ED ''et al.''

Metformin has also been suggested to increase production of lactate in the small intestine; this could potentially contribute to lactic acidosis in those with risk factors.<ref name=Kirpichnikov/> However, the clinical significance of this is unknown, and the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is most commonly attributed to decreased hepatic uptake rather than increased intestinal production.<ref name=Umesh/><ref name=Golan/><ref>{{vcite book |author=Davis SN |editor=Brunton L, Lazo J, Parker K |title=[[Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics]] |edition=11th |year=2006 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-142280-2 |pages= |chapter=Chapter 60: Insulin, Oral Hypoglycemic Agents, and the Pharmacology of the Endocrine Pancreas}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
The usual [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of metformin, originally described in 1922 and reproduced in multiple later patents and publications, involves the reaction of [[dimethylamine]] [[hydrochloride]] and [[2-cyanoguanidine]] (dicyandiamide) with heating.<ref name = werner/><ref>{{vcite journal |author=Shapiro SL, Parrino VA, Freedman L |title=Hypoglycemic Agents.

[[File:Metformin synthesis.svg|center|300px]]

According to the procedure described in the 1975 Aron patent,<ref>{{vcite journal |title=Procédé de préparation de chlorhydrate de diméthylbiguanide |journal=Patent FR 2322860|language=French|year=1975}}</ref> and the ''Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia'',<ref name="isbn0-8155-1526-X">{{vcite book |title=Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia (Sittig's Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia) |edition=3rd |volume=3 |publisher=William Andrew |location=Norwich, NY |year=2007 |pages=2208 |isbn=0-8155-1526-X}}</ref> [[equivalent weight|equimolar]] amounts of dimethylamine and 2-cyanoguanidine are dissolved in [[toluene]] with cooling to make a [[Concentration#Qualitative description|concentrated]] solution, and an equimolar amount of [[hydrogen chloride]] is slowly added. The mixture begins to boil on its own, and after cooling, metformin hydrochloride [[precipitate]]s with a 96% [[Yield (chemistry)|yield]].

==Structure==
The structure of metformin was generally represented in a wrong tautomeric form for a number of years. This was corrected in 2005.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Bharatam PV, Patel DS, Iqbal P, |title=Pharmacophoric Features of Biguanide Derivatives: An Electronic and Structural Analysis |journal=[[J Med Chem]] |issue=24 |volume=48 |year=2005 |pages=7615–7622 |doi=10.1021/jm050602z}}</ref> The energy difference between the correct tautomer and the generally represented tautomer is about 37 kJ/mol (9 kcal/mol). The drug is administered as metformin hydrochloride. The structure of the metformin hydrochloride was also corrected recently.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Patel DS, Bharatam PV |title=Novel N(L)2 species with two lone pairs on nitrogen: systems isoelectronic to carbodicarbenes |journal=[[Chem Commun]] |issue=9 |year=2009 |pages=1064–6 |doi=10.1039/b816595e}}</ref> According to these studies, the metformin has different electronic structure compared to its protonated form. The neutral species is a simple conjugated system. Upon protonation, (i) the conjugation breaks down, (ii) the intramolecular hydrogen bond breaks down, (iii) the molecule becomes non-planar (iv) two lone pairs get accumulated at the central nitrogen (v) dynamism increases in the system via C=N rotational process and via N-inversion process. Thus, electronically, metformin hydrochloride should be treated as a simple extension of metformin. The nucleophilicity of metformin hydrochloride is moderate and that is a desired property. Metformin is shown to belong to a new class of compounds called nitreones.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Metformin has an oral [[bioavailability]] of 50–60% under [[fasting]] conditions, and is absorbed slowly.<ref name=PI>{{vcite web |author=[[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2008/020357s031,021202s016lbl.pdf |title=Glucophage (metformin hydrochloride tablets) Label Information |year=August 27, 2008 |accessdate=2009-12-08 |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration}}</ref><ref name = Heller>{{vcite journal |author=Heller JB |title=Metformin overdose in dogs and cats |journal=Veterinary Medicine |issue=April |year=2007 |pages=231–233 |url=http://www.aspca.org/site/DocServer/vetm0407_231-234.pdf?docID=11061 }}</ref> Peak plasma concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>) are reached within one to three hours of taking immediate-release metformin and four to eight hours with extended-release formulations.<ref name=PI/><ref name = Heller/> The [[plasma protein binding]] of metformin is negligible, as reflected by its very high [[volume of distribution|apparent volume of distribution]] (300–1000&nbsp;L after a single dose). [[Steady state]] is usually reached in one or two days.<ref name=PI/>

Metformin has acid dissociation constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5 and, therefore, exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values. The metformin acid dissociation constant values (pKa) make metformin a stronger base than most other basic drugs with less than 0.01% unionized in blood. Furthermore, the lipid solubility of the unionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value [log(10) of the distribution coefficient of the unionized form between octanol and water] of -1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and, consequently, rapid passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely. The logP of metformin is less than that of [[phenformin]] (-0.84) because two methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger phenylethyl side chain in phenformin. More lipophilic derivatives of metformin are presently being investigated with the aim of producing prodrugs with better oral absorption than metformin itself.<ref>Garry G.

==History==
The [[biguanide]] class of antidiabetic drugs, which also includes the withdrawn agents [[phenformin]] and [[buformin]], originates from the [[Galega officinalis|French lilac]] or goat's rue (''Galega officinalis''), a plant used in folk medicine for several centuries.<ref name = Witters>{{vcite journal |author=Witters L |title=The blooming of the French lilac |journal=J Clin Invest |volume=108 |issue=8 |pages=1105–7 |year=2001 |pmid=11602616 |doi=10.1172/JCI14178 |pmc=209536 |url=http://www.jci.org/articles/view/14178}}</ref>

Metformin became available in the [[British National Formulary]] in 1958. It was sold in the UK by a small Aron subsidiary called Rona. <!--Being a generic drug, it was at a commercial disadvantage; phenformin and buformin were marketed as being more potent and were supported by large pharmaceutical companies with a large sales force.

==Formulations==
[[Image:Metformin 500mg Tablets.jpg|thumb|right|Generic metformin 500&nbsp;mg tablets, as sold in the United Kingdom]]
Metformin is sold under several [[trade name]]s, including Glucophage XR, Carbophage SR, Riomet, Fortamet, Glumetza, Obimet, Gluformin, Dianben, Diabex, and Diaformin. <!-- editors, please note that the trade names noted above redirect to this section i.e. Metformin#Formulations-->

Metformin IR (immediate release) is available in 500&nbsp;mg, 850&nbsp;mg, and 1000&nbsp;mg tablets; all are now generic in the U.S.

Metformin SR (slow release) or XR (extended release) was introduced in 2004, in 500&nbsp;mg and 750&nbsp;mg strengths, mainly to counteract the most common gastrointestinal side effects, as well as to increase compliance by reducing [[pill burden]]. No difference in effectiveness exists between the two preparations.

===Combinations with other drugs===
When used for type 2 diabetes, metformin is often prescribed in combination with other drugs. Several are available as [[fixed-dose combination]]s, also with the purpose of reducing pill burden and making administration simpler and more convenient.<ref name=FDC>{{vcite journal |author=Bailey CJ, Day C |title=Fixed-dose single tablet antidiabetic combinations |journal=Diabetes Obes Metab |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=527–33 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19175373 |doi=10.1111/j.1463-1326.2008.00993.x}}</ref>
