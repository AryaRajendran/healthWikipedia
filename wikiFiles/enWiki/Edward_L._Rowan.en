In his book ''Understanding Child Sexual Abuse'', Rowan discusses a 1998 study at [[Temple University]] which stated: "while child sexual abuse was morally and legally wrong and obviously devastating to some individuals, it was not inherently and inevitably harmful." He goes on to explain the lasting changes in survivors' ability to regulate emotion, and in cognition and memory. In discussing treatment of the victim and perpetrator, he states that treatment does not seem to reduce the rate of perpetrator recidivism and that prevention is also "elusive". Rowan encourages parents to educate their children on the dangers of sexual abuse, highlighting new prevention programs of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Boy Scouts of America]].<ref name="pubweek">{{cite web |last=Rowan, MD |first=Edward L. |title=Understanding Child Sexual Abuse (Understanding Health and Sickness Series) |year=2010 |publisher=Publishers Weekly |url=http://www.bookdigger.com/medical_books/s/Sexual_Health/Understanding_Child_Sexual_Abuse_Understanding_Health_and_Sickness_Series__157806807X.htm |accessdate=2010-07-11}}{{subscription required}}</ref><ref name="templerpt">{{cite book |last=Rowan, MD |first=Edward L. |title=Understanding Child Sexual Abuse |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson, MS |year=2006 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rBJlR1K1umAC&pg=PA112 |pages=x, 12, 23, 70–72, 92, 101, 112 |isbn=1-57806-806-1}}</ref>
