'''Wilhelm Siegmund Frei''' (September 5, 1885, [[Prudnik|Neustadt]] – January 27, 1943) was a German [[dermatologist]] best known for his contributions to [[Durand-Nicolas-Favre disease]], a [[sexually transmitted disease]] found mainly in tropical and subtropical climates. He is also known for the [[Frei Test]], which was developed in 1925 for the detection of [[lymphogranuloma venereum]] (LGV).

== Early life ==
His father, Emil Frei, was a [[mining firm]] director, from [[Prudnik|Neustadt]], [[Upper Silesia]]. His mother was Frederika Ring, who came from [[Austria]]. Wilhelm had two sisters, Gerta Frei (1887 — presumably killed by Nazis) and Josephina Frei (1888).

== Life ==
Wilhelm studied medicine in [[Freiburg]], Germany, and went on to get his [[doctorate]] in [[Göttingen]] in 1913. He met [[Magda Frankfurter]] (1885–1973) when they were both studying medicine in Freiburg and was married on January 12, 1912. They had their first child Marianne, later that year on November 7, 1912, and their second child Fritz was born on December 12, 1915.

Due to the rise of the [[Nazis]] and bad times looming ahead in Germany, he immigrated to New York with his family and went to work at the [[Montefiore Medical Center|Montefiore Hospital]] in the [[Bronx]] from 1937 until he fell ill and died on January 27, 1943, leaving behind his wife and three children at the age of 58.
