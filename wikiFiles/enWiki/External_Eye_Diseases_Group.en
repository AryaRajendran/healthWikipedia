The '''External Eye Disease Group'', or '''EED Group''', has been formed in 2004 in order to address problems with [[Red eye (medicine)|red eye]] (non-traumatic inflammation of the external eye).

==Creation==
Together with [[refractive error]]s, [[Red eye (medicine)|red eye]] (non-traumatic inflammation of the external eye) is the most frequent [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] reason for visiting family [[Doctor of Medicine|medicine doctors]], [[Pediatrics|pediatricians]] or ophthalmologists.{{cn|date=April 2013}}  Despite this fact, surprisingly few [[Research|studies]] have focused on how red eye is being [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosed]], [[Therapy|treated]] and followed up by those groups of [[physician]]s.  Also, comparatively few groups of physicians in the world deal specifically with this issue.

In order to address this problem, the External Eye Disease Group, or EED Group, has been formed in 2004.  Currently, it includes ophthalmologists from the [[Southeast Europe|Southeastern Europe]] and the [[Middle East]]: [[Belarus]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Egypt]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Russian Federation]], [[Slovenia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Turkey]] and [[Ukraine]].  Representatives from [[Bosnia]], [[Serbia]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[United Arab Emirates]] are likely to join the group this year.{{when|date=April 2013}}

==Main fields of interest==
The main interests of the EED Group are non-[[Trauma (medicine)|traumatic]] [[inflammation]] of the [[Mammalian_eye#Three_layers|external eye]], mainly caused by [[Pathogenic bacteria|bacterial]] and [[Viral disease|viral]] infection, [[Keratoconjunctivitis sicca|dry eye]] or [[allergy]].

==Key Faculty==
The group is presided by the Key Faculty, which comprises Prof. Andras Berta (Hungary), Prof. Janos Nemeth (Hungary), Prof. Marek Prost (Poland), Prof. Mohamed Higazy (Egypt), Dr. Igor Petriček (Croatia), and Dr. Pavel Nemec (Czech Republic).  It holds annual [[meeting]]s on which it discusses topics related to the external eye disease, and plans and organizes activities of the wider group.

==Main goals and activities==
Main goal of the group is education of ophthalmologists and other physicians in the region of country members involved in treating external eye diseases, by disseminating most current [[knowledge]] in the field.  They hold [[lecture]]s and publish educational material ([[Flyer (pamphlet)|leaflets]], [[brochure]]s) targeting [[patient]]s and [[pharmacist]]s as well.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Radna skupina za bolesti vanjskog dijela oka |language=Croatian |trans_title=Task Force for External Eye Diseases |journal=Medix |issue=84/85 |pages=117–118 }}</ref>

==Publications==
The group has jointly published several [[Scientific literature|medical paper]]s:
