'''Steatopygia''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|s|t|iː|ˌ|æ|t|ɵ|ˈ|p|ɪ|dʒ|i|ə}};<ref>http://content.answers.com/main/content/ahd4/pron/S0728900.wav</ref> {{lang-el|''στεατοπυγία''}}) is a high degree of [[Adipose fat|fat]] accumulation in and around the [[buttock]]s. The deposit of fat is not confined to the [[gluteal]] regions, but extends to the outside and front of the [[thigh]]s, forming a thick layer reaching sometimes to the [[knee]].

==History==
Steatopygia is a genetic characteristic of the [[Khoisan]] and the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] peoples. It is especially prevalent in women, but also occurs to a lesser degree in men. In most populations of ''Homo sapiens'', females are more likely than men to accumulate [[adipose tissue]] in the buttock region. It has also been observed among the [[Pygmy|Pygmies]] of [[Central Africa]] and the [[Onge people|Onge]]-tribe of the [[Andaman Islands]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/chapter5/text5.htm |title=Chapter 5: A Physical Examination |publisher=Andaman.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref> Among the Khoisan, it is regarded as a sign of [[beauty]]:  It begins in infancy and is fully developed by the time of the first [[pregnancy]]

Steatopygia would seem to have been a characteristic of a population that once extended from the [[Gulf of Aden]] to the [[Cape of Good Hope]], of which Khoisan and Pygmies are remnants. While the Khoisan are most noticeable examples, it occurs in other parts of Africa, and occurs even more frequently among male [[Baster]]s than among [[Khoikhoi]] women.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} It is also observed among [[Andamanese]] [[Negrito]] women.

It has been suggested that this feature was once more widespread. [[Paleolithic]] [[Venus figurines]], sometimes referred to as "steatopygian Venus" figures,  discovered from Europe to Siberia and presenting a remarkable development of the thighs, and even the prolongation of the labia minora, have been used to support this theory..<ref name="softpedia">{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/What-is-Steatopygia-51231.shtml|title=What is Steatopygia?

However, these figures do not strictly qualify as steatopygian, since they exhibit an angle of approximately 120 degrees between the back and the buttocks,<ref>{{cite book|last=Passemard|first=L.|title=Les statuettes féminines paléolithiques dites Vénus stéatopyges|publisher=Tessier|location=Nîmes|date=1938}}</ref> while steatopygia is diagnosed at an angle of about 90 degrees only.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
