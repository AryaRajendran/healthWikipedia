The '''Reinsch test''' is an initial indicator to detect the presence of one or more of the following [[heavy metals]] in a biological sample, and is often used by [[toxicologist]]s where poisoning by such metals is suspected. 

* [[Antimony]]
* [[Arsenic]] 
* [[Bismuth]]
* [[Selenium]]
* [[Thallium]]
* [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]

==Process==

* Dissolve suspect body fluid or tissue in a [[hydrochloric acid]] solution
* Insert a [[copper]] strip into the solution.  
* The appearance of a silvery coating on the copper may indicate [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]].  A dark coating indicative of the presence of one of the other metals. 
* Confirm finding using absorption  or emission [[spectroscopy]], [[X-ray diffraction]], or other analytical technique suitable for [[inorganic]] analysis.

* A scientific application of the Reinsch Test was presented in 2010 by chemists of Technische Universität München, Lehrstuhl für Radiochemie (Institute for Radiochemistry, [[Technical University Munich]]) and ITU ([[Institute for Transuranium Elements]], Karlsruhe): in the course of the radiochemical purification of [[Selenium-79|<sup>79</sup>Se]] for the determination of its [[half-life]], reductive deposition of selenium on metallic copper was the first step to extract <sup>79</sup>Se from high active raffinate (= [[PUREX raffinate]]) in a [[hot cell]].<ref>[http://www.ptb.de/en/org/6/nachrichten6/2010/60710_en.htm The half-life of <sup>79</sup>Se<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>Jörg, G., Bühnemann, R., Hollas, S., Kivel, N., Kossert, K., Van Winckel, S., Lierse v.
