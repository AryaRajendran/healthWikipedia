'''Dizziness''' is an impairment in spatial perception and stability.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000031973|dizziness}}</ref> Because the term ''dizziness'' is imprecise,<ref>{{MeshName|Dizziness}}</ref> it can refer to [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[presyncope]], [[disequilibrium]],<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dons/part_2/chapter_14.html#chpt_14_presyncope |chapter=Chapter 14: Evaluation of the Dizzy Patient |author=Reeves, Alexander G., Swenson, Rand S. |title=Disorders of the Nervous System: A Primer |year=2008 |publisher=Dartmouth Medical School |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dons/index.html}}</ref> or a non-specific feeling such as giddiness or foolishness.<ref name=UTD>{{cite web |url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-dizziness |title=Approach to the patient with dizziness |author=Branch, Jr, William T., Barton, Jason

One can induce dizziness by engaging in disorientating activities such as spinning.

* [[Vertigo (medical)|Vertigo]] is the sensation of spinning or having one's surroundings spin about them. Many people find vertigo very disturbing and often report associated nausea and vomiting.  It represents about 25% of cases of occurrences of dizziness.<ref name=Epi09/>
* [[equilibrioception|Disequilibrium]] is the sensation of being off balance, and is most often characterized by frequent falls in a specific direction.  This condition is not often associated with nausea or vomiting.
* [[Presyncope]] is [[lightheadedness]], muscular weakness and feeling faint as opposed to a [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]], which is actually fainting.
* Non-specific dizziness is often psychiatric in origin.  It is a diagnosis of exclusion and can sometimes be brought about by [[hyperventilation]].<ref name=UTD/>

A [[stroke]] is the cause of isolated dizziness in 0.7% of people who present to the emergency room.<ref name=Epi09/>

==Classification==
Dizziness is broken down into 4 main subtypes: [[vertigo]] (~50%), [[disequilibrium]] (less than ~15%), [[presyncope]] (less than ~15%) and [[lightheadedness]] (~10%).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Post RE, Dickerson LM |title=Dizziness: a diagnostic approach |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=361–8, 369 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20704166 }}

==Differential diagnosis==
Many conditions are associated with dizziness. However, the most common subcategories can be broken down as follows: 40% peripheral vestibular dysfunction, 10% central nervous system lesion, 15% psychiatric disorder, 25% presyncope/dysequilibrium, and 10% nonspecific dizziness.<ref name=chan>{{cite journal |author=Chan Y |title=Differential diagnosis of dizziness |journal=Curr Opin Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=200–3 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19365263 |doi=10.1097/MOO.0b013e32832b2594 |url=}}</ref> The medical conditions that often have dizziness as a symptom include:<ref name=chan/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Tusa RJ |title=Dizziness |journal=Med.

==Mechanism==
Many conditions cause dizziness because multiple parts of the body are required for maintaining balance including the inner ear, eyes, muscles, skeleton, and the nervous system.<ref name=merck>{{cite web |title=Dizziness and Vertigo |year=2009 |publisher=Merck Manual |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec08/ch084/ch084e.html?qt=dizziness&alt=sh}}</ref>

Common physiological causes of dizziness include: 
*inadequate blood supply to the brain due to:
**a sudden fall in blood pressure<ref name=merck />
**heart problems or artery blockages<ref name=merck />
*loss or distortion of vision or visual cues<ref name=merck />
*disorders of the inner ear<ref name=merck />
*distortion of brain/nervous function by medications such as anticonvulsants and sedatives<ref name=merck />

==Epidemiology==
About 20–30% of the population report to have experienced dizziness at some point in the previous year.<ref name=Epi09>{{cite journal |author=Neuhauser HK, Lempert T |title=Vertigo: epidemiologic aspects |journal=Semin Neurol |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=473–81 |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19834858 |doi=10.1055/s-0029-1241043 |url=}}</ref>
