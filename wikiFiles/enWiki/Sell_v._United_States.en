'''''Sell v. United States''''', {{ussc|539|166|2003}} is a [[landmark decision]] in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] imposed stringent limits on the right of a lower court to order the [[involuntary treatment|forcible administration]] of [[antipsychotic|antipsychotic medication]] to a criminal [[defendant]] who had been determined to be  [[competence (law)|incompetent to stand trial]] for the sole purpose of making them competent and able to be tried. Specifically, the court held that  lower courts could do so only under limited circumstances in which specified criteria had been met.  In the case of Charles Sell, since the lower court had failed to determine that all the appropriate criteria for court-ordered forcible treatment had been met, the order to forcibly medicate the defendant was reversed.

Previously, in ''[[Washington v. Harper]]'' [[Case citation|494 U.S. 210]] (1990), the Supreme Court made clear that the forced medication of [[Incarceration|inmate]]s with [[mental illness|mental disorders]] could be ordered only when the inmate was a danger to themselves or others and when the medication is in the inmate's own best interests. In addition, courts must first consider "alternative, less intrusive means" before resorting to the involuntary administration of psychotropic medication.<ref>{{cite web

Using the framework set forth in ''[[Riggins v. Nevada]]'' [[Case citation|504 U.S. 127]] (1992),  the Court emphasized that an individual has a constitutionally protected  "interest in avoiding involuntary administration of antipsychotic drugs" and this interest is one that only an "essential" or "overriding" state interest might overcome.<ref name="breyeropinion"/>
<!-- ==History==
In a 12-month period studied by the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|Bureau of Prisons]], 285 cases of antipsychotic drug were administrated. The government's belief is that these usages are medically appropriate and highly effective (success rates of 75 to 90%) with minor or manageable side effects. Further, improved medications are continuing to be developed. In the Bureau of Prisons study, the 226 cases of voluntary administration showed an 88% success rate, while the success rate of the 59 cases of involuntary administration was 76%.<ref name="duke"/> -->

==Facts of the case==
In 1997, Charles Thomas Sell, a [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] dentist with no prior history of criminal behavior, was charged with fifty-six counts of [[mail fraud]], six counts of Medicaid fraud, and one count of money-laundering.<ref name="cornell">{{Cite web| year= 2003| month = June 16| url= http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-5664.ZS.html| title= Sell v. United States| publisher= Cornell University Law School| accessdate  = 2007-10-30}}</ref> 
That year a [[United States federal judge|federal judge]] found Sell [[competence (law)|competent to stand trial]] and released him on [[bail]]. However, Sell's [[mental status]] deteriorated while he was on bail, and his bail was revoked in 1998. Also in 1998, on the basis of a videotape provided by an undercover agent, Sell was charged with one count of conspiring to commit  the [[attempted murder]] of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] officer arresting him.<ref name="cornell"/>  The agent later interviewed Sell in jail, and by questioning got him to say something about hiring a [[hit man]].<ref name="aaps2005">{{Cite web|year= 2005| month= April 18|url=http://www.aapsonline.org/nod/newsofday162.htm|title= Charles Thomas Sell, D.D.S., to be released on Alford plea| publisher   = Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, Inc.|accessdate  = 2007-11-01}}</ref> In early 1999 Sell requested a competency hearing before standing trial for the fraud and attempted murder charges.<ref name="duke">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/commentary/selvuni|title=Sell v. United States|publisher=www.law.duke.edu|accessdate=2008-12-08}}</ref>

Sell was given a [[competency evaluation (law)|competency evaluation]] by the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners (Medical Center), and in 1999 was found incompetent to stand trial. Sell was ordered to be hospitalized to determine whether he would be able to become competent so as to allow his trial to proceed. While in the hospital, Sell refused to take the antipsychotic medication prescribed by the Medical Center staff. The Medical Center sought to involuntarily medicate Sell. On June 9, 1999, an administrative hearing was held before a medical hearing officer who concluded that antipsychotic medication was the treatment of choice based on the fact that Dr. Sell's "delusional thinking could make him dangerous." Sell filed a court challenge to stop the hospital's decision to give him the drug involuntarily.<ref name="cornell"/> 

The question of whether the drug could be administered involuntarily was the subject of several other hearings. In August 2000 the magistrate found that Sell was a danger to himself and others, authorized Sell to be forcibly medicated on the grounds that only medication would reduce his dangerousness, that any serious side effects could be treated, that the benefits to Sell were greater than the risks, and that the medication were substantially likely to restore Sell's competence.<ref name="findlaw">{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=02-5664|title=FindLaw | Cases and Codes|publisher=caselaw.lp.findlaw.com|accessdate=2008-12-08}}</ref>

In 2001, Sell appealed on [[certiorari]] to the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri|Federal District Court]] which, while reversing the federal magistrate's finding of dangerousness, upheld the order of forced medication on the grounds that it was necessary to restore Sell's competency to stand trial. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirmed the lower court's decision in a divided vote.<ref name="cornell"/> Sell's attorney pointed out that Sell had already been incarcerated for a longer period of time than if he were convicted for the offenses as charged.<ref name="aaps2005"/>

Sell, on [[Writ of Certiorari]], appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The [[American Psychological Association]] filed an [[amicus curiae]] brief taking a neutral position, supporting neither the government's nor Sell's position.<ref>{{Cite web|year  =2003| month= June 17| url= http://www.apa.org/releases/sellvsus.html|title=Court's Decision in Sell v.

==Issue==
The question before the Supreme Court was whether the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] permits the federal government to forcibly administer antipsychotic medication  to a mentally ill, but not dangerous, criminal defendant for the sole purpose of rendering him competent to stand trial for serious but nonviolent crimes, thereby violating his [[cognitive liberty]]. Civil liberties organizations contend Dr. Sell's right to physical and mental integrity is guaranteed under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]], [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]]s to the U.S. Constitution.<ref>{{Cite web

==Decision==
Although the Supreme Court upheld two aspects of the appeal, it ultimately vacated and remanded on the question of the petitioner's dangerousness.

* '''Held'''
In a divided opinion  (6-3), the Court held that the Constitution allows the Federal Government to administer antipsychotic drugs, even against the defendant's will, in limited circumstances as decided previously in [[Washington v. Harper]] and [[Riggins v. Nevada]]. It affirmed that involuntary administration for the purposes of restoring a defendants competency to stand trial can be an appropriate means of acting in the state's interest to bring to trial defendants who are charged with serious crimes, overriding the defendant's right to refuse forced medication. However, the court outlined specific criteria which must be satisfied to justify involuntary medication. This framework was outlined in ''Riggins v. Nevada''.<ref name="breyeropinion"/>

# An important government issue must be at stake and only a case by case inquiry can determine whether the government's interest is mitigated by the possibility of a long [[civil commitment]] for the treatment of the mental illness or by the fact that long periods of confinement have already been served, as this would be subtracted from any criminal sentence.
# There must be a substantial probability that the medication will enable the defendant to become competent without substantial undermining side effects.
# The medication must be necessary to restore the defendant's competency, with no alternative, less intrusive procedures available that would produce the same results.

{{Quotation|[T]he Constitution permits the Government involuntarily to administer antipsychotic drugs to a mentally ill defendant facing serious criminal charges in order to render that defendant competent to stand trial, but only if the treatment is medically appropriate, is substantially unlikely to have side effects that may undermine the fairness of the trial, and, taking account of less intrusive alternatives, is necessary significantly to further important governmental trial-related interests.<ref name="breyeropinion"/>}}

* '''Held'''
The Supreme Court held that the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals erred in approving the lower court's order to allow forced medication to restore Sell's competence to stand trial because the original decisions of the hospital and the judge were based on an assessment of Sell's dangerousness. Since the experts testifying at the hearings focused mainly on the issue of dangerousness and not on Sell's trial competence, there was not enough evidence in the court record regarding the possible effect of the medication on Sell's ability to obtain a fair trial.

* '''Vacated and remanded'''
In examining the lower courts' findings, the Court found no evidence that Sell was dangerous, so the Court assumed that he was not. Determining that the findings of the District Court and Court of Appeals did not satisfy the criteria for involuntary medication, the Court vacated the appellate court's judgment.

===Summary===
The Court in its decision wrote that the standards it outlined will allow involuntary medication  for the sole purpose of rendering the defendant competent to stand trial only in rare instances. The standard implies that a court must find that important governmental interests are at stake and that its interest in bringing the accused to trial for serious crimes is  important enough to override constitutional issues, and that the forced medication will not significantly interfere with the defense or have untoward [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]]. Therefore, in each case the facts and circumstances must be considered individually, balancing the government's responsibility to ensure timely prosecution with an equal interest in making sure a defendant obtains a fair trial. The court must weight these factors and decide if forced medication will significantly further or hinder these conflicting interests of the state.

==Significance==
It is unknown in how many cases  involuntary administration will now be justified, and any  procedure outlined by the Court will require the government to submit proof on all the criteria outlined by the court. Beyond the federal situation, any constitutional ruling will apply to  all criminal proceedings, state as well as federal.<ref name="duke"/> However, although this  decision possibly affects only a small percentage of trials, it seems to add weight to a growing acceptance of the belief that government can override the constitutional rights of self-determination on medical matters.<ref name="monitor">{{Cite web

</ref> The case potentially could have addressed a more serious question of whether governmental manipulation of an individual's mental state through psychotropic drug administration is based  on false assumptions of what makes up a person's individuality. The court chose to sidestep this issue.<ref name="monitor"/>

However, others disagreed, arguing that the strict limits imposed by the Supreme Court on involuntary medication meant that the involuntary medication of a non dangerous defendant would be rare, especially since government's "important" interest in bringing the defendant to trial must be unattainable by alternative, less invasive means.<ref>{{cite news

At the very least however, the criteria set forth  by the court will ensure that the lower courts considering the issue of forced medication must determine why it is medically appropriate to force drug an individual who is not dangerous and furthermore is competent to make up his own mind about treatment.<ref name="aapsonline">{{Cite web

==Subsequent developments==
In 2004, Sell was found competent to stand trial and trial was scheduled. A week before the trial was to begin, the prosecution and defense claimed that he was mentally unfit for trial and the trial was continued.<ref name="aapsonline"/> 
 
On April 18, 2005, Sell pleaded [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to federal charges of [[fraud]] and [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to kill a federal agent, after serving eight years without trial in federal prison. The U.S. District Judge sentenced him to [[time served]], six months in a [[halfway house]] and three years on [[parole]].<ref name="aaps2005"/>
