'''MALT lymphoma''' (MALToma) is a form of [[lymphoma]] involving the [[mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue]] (MALT), frequently of the [[stomach]], but virtually any mucosal site can be afflicted. It is a [[cancer]] originating from [[B cell]]s in the [[marginal zone]] of the MALT, and is also called '''extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma'''.

== Associations ==
Gastric MALT lymphoma is frequently associated (72–98%) with chronic [[inflammation]] as a result of the presence of ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'',<ref>{{cite journal | author = Parsonnet J, Hansen S, Rodriguez L, Gelb A, Warnke R, Jellum E, Orentreich N, Vogelman J, Friedman G | title = ''Helicobacter pylori'' infection and gastric lymphoma. | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 330 | issue = 18 | pages = 1267–71 | year = 1994 | pmid = 8145781 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199405053301803}}</ref> potentially involving chronic inflammation, or the action of ''H. pylori'' virulence factors such as [[CagA]].<ref name="pmid16367902">{{cite journal | author = Hatakeyama, M. & Higashi, H. | title = Helicobacter pylori CagA: a new paradigm for bacterial carcinogenesis | journal = Cancer Science | volume = 96 | issue = | pages = 835–843 | year = 2005 | month = | pmid = 16367902 | doi = 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2005.00130.x }}</ref>

The initial diagnosis is made by [[biopsy]] of suspicious lesions on [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy]] (EGD, upper endoscopy). Simultaneous tests for ''H. pylori'' are also done to detect the presence of this microbe.

In other sites, chronic immune stimulation is also suspected in the pathogenesis (e.g. association between chronic [[autoimmune diseases]] such as [[Sjögren's syndrome]] and [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]], and MALT lymphoma of the [[salivary gland]] and the [[Thyroid lymphoma|thyroid]]).

== Treatment ==
If the disease is limited to the stomach (which is assessed with [[computed tomography]]), then 70–80% of patients will have a complete regression on treatment with [[antibiotic]] eradication of ''H. pylori''.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bayerdörffer E, Neubauer A, Rudolph B, Thiede C, Lehn N, Eidt S, Stolte M | title = Regression of primary gastric lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type after cure of ''Helicobacter pylori'' infection.

Others may be effectively controlled with the use of radiotherapy, or surgery. Both modalities may be curative in localized disease.

In contrast, if the disease has spread or has been [[refractory]] on antibiotics, [[chemotherapy]] may need to be considered.

Two other [[Genetics|genetic]] alterations are known:
* t(1;14)(p22;q32) which deregulates [[BCL10]], at the locus [[chromosome 1|1p22]].
* t(14;18)(q32;q21), which deregulates [[MALT1]], at the locus [[chromosome 18|18q21]].

These seem to turn-on the same pathway as API2-MLT (i.e., that of [[NF-κB]]). They both act upon [[IGH@|IGH]],<ref name="pmid15682443">{{cite journal |author=Ye H, Gong L, Liu H, ''et al.'' |title=MALT lymphoma with t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-MALT1 is characterized by strong cytoplasmic MALT1 and BCL10 expression |journal=J.
