The '''management of baldness''' is a multidisciplinary effort that spans the [[dermatology|medical]], [[pharmacist|pharmaceutical]], [[food supplement]], [[exercise]] and [[fashion]] industries. Androgenic alopecia, [[alopecia areata]], and [[telogen effluvium]] are the primary nonscarring alopecias.<ref name="Summary">{{cite pmid|16616303}}</ref> The most common cause of hair loss in men is ''androgenic alopecia'', the early stages of which can be slowed or reversed with medication, while more advanced cases may be amenable to hair transplantation. ''Alopecia areata'' presents as focal discoid patches of hair loss, and affects up to 2% of the U.S. population, occurring more often in children. ''Telogen effluvium'' can occur after stressful events, including severe illness, childbirth, or high fever, and can be seen with certain medications or deficiency of iron, particularly in females.<ref name="Summary"/> Thyroid dysfunction, both when [[hyperthyroidism|increased]] and [[hypothyroidism|decreased]], can lead to specific patterns of hair loss.

==Androgenic alopecia==
{{main|Management of androgenic alopecia}}
[[File:Skin.png|thumb|left|[[Hair follicle]] with mesenchymal [[dermal papilla]], labelled at top, location of hair follicle [[stem cell]]s and thought to be site of action of [[Dihydrotestosterone|DHT]].]][[Androgenic alopecia|Androgenic hair loss]] is due to the activity of androgens, predominantly [[dihydrotestosterone|DHT]], at the dermal papillae of the individual follicles. In adult men, its incidence is roughly equivalent to chronologic age, and it has a strong genetic component.<ref name="Percent">{{cite web|url =http://www.intelihealth.com/IH/ihtIH/WSIHW000/9023/24253/352721.html?d=dmtContent|title = The Bald Truth About Hair Loss In Young Men|accessdate = December 16, 2012|date = August 8, 2002|publisher = Stephanie Whyche, InteliHealth News Service}}</ref>

The physiology is primarily [[androgen]]ic, with [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) the major contributor. Androgens are important in male sexual development around birth and at puberty. They regulate sebaceous glands, apocrine hair growth and libido. With increasing age,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hair-loss/hair-loss-causes|title=Help for Hair Loss: Men's Hair Loss – Causes|publisher= Webmd.com |date = March 1, 2010}}</ref> androgens stimulate hair growth on the face, but suppress it at the temples and scalp vertex, a condition that has been referred to as the 'androgen paradox'.<ref name="paradox">{{cite pmid|23016593}}</ref>

Several lines of evidence support the [[dermal papilla]] of the [[hair follicle]] as the androgenic target for hair loss prevention and reversal.<ref name="structure">{{cite pmid|19477078}}</ref> [[5-alpha reductase|Type 1 and 2 5α reductase enzymes]] are present at [[Sebaceous gland|pilosebaceous units]] in papillae of individual [[hair follicle]]s. They catalyze formation of the androgens testosterone and DHT, which in turn regulate hair growth. Androgens have different effects at different follicles: they stimulate [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]] at facial hair, leading to growth, but stimulate [[TGF beta 1|TGF β1]], [[TGF beta 2|TGF β2]], [[DKK1|dickkopf1]] and [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]] at the scalp, leading to miniaturization.<ref name="paradox"/>

Female androgenic alopecia is characterized by diffuse crown thinning without hairline recession, and like its male counterpart rarely leads to [[alopecia totalis|total hair loss]].<ref name="Female pattern baldness"/> [[Finasteride]] and [[minoxidil]] are usually first line therapy for its treatment. Other options include topical or systemic [[spironolactone]] or [[flutamide]], although they have a high incidence of [[feminization (biology)|feminizing]] [[side effects]] and are better tolerated in female androgenic hair loss.

More advanced cases may be resistant or unresponsive to medical therapy, however, and require [[hair transplantation]]. Naturally-occurring units of one to four hairs, called [[hair follicle|follicular units]], are excised and moved to areas of [[hair restoration]]. These follicular units are surgically implanted in the scalp in close proximity and in large numbers. The grafts are obtained from either [[Follicular unit transplantation|Follicular Unit Transplantation]] (FUT), colloquially referred to as 'strip harvesting,' or [[Follicular Unit Extraction]] (FUE). In the former, a strip of skin with follicular units is extracted and dissected into individual follicular unit grafts. The surgeon then implants the grafts into small incisions, called recipient sites.<ref>{{cite pmid|22808618}}</ref><ref name="pmid 21792780">{{cite pmid|21792780}}</ref> Specialized scalp tattoos can also mimic the appearance of a short buzzed haircut.<ref name="abc">{{cite news |title= Considering a hair tattoo?

===Androgenic impact of exercise===
[[File:RIAN archive 555848 Testing on treadmill.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The impact of exercise on hair loss is different in acute and chronic settings.]] Exercise can impact androgenic hair loss at least partially by affecting androgen and estrogen levels.
Quantification of androgen indices in response to exercise can be understood in four categories: short versus long term, and anaerobic versus aerobic. These are indirect assays of exercise impact on hair loss, although the ability of [[exogenous]] androgen to worsen or precipitate miniaturization in the genetically predisposed is well documented.<ref>{{pmid|10710012}}</ref> Investigations have been either self-report, or cross-sectional and cohort studies with exercise and serum hormonal indices, but no phase III [[clinical trial]]s. In some studies, conflicting results are thought related to differences in exercise mode, volume, or physical condition of subjects.<ref>{{cite pmid|14514704}}</ref>

In cross-sectional analyses, aerobic exercisers have lower basal total and free testosterone compared to the sedentary.<ref name="arce">{{cite pmid|8425638}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|3343919}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|6429357}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|9625362}}</ref> Anaerobic exercisers also have lower testosterone compared to the sedentary<ref name="arce"/> but a slight increase in basal testosterone with resistance training over time.<ref name="2 year"/> Acutely, testosterone briefly increases when comparing aerobic, anaerobic and mixed forms of exercise.<ref name="Kramer">{{Cite pmid|9535580}}</ref> A study assessed men who were resistance trained, endurance trained, or sedentary in which they either rested, ran or did a resistance session. Androgens increased in response to exercise, particularly resistance, while cortisol only increased with resistance. After initial post-exercise increase, there was decline in free and total testosterone during resistance recovery, particularly in resistance-trained subjects. Endurance-trained subjects showed less change in hormone levels in response to exercise than resistance-trained subjects.<ref name="combined">{{Cite pmid|14514704}}</ref> Another study found relative short term effects of aerobic, anaerobic and combined anaerobic-aerobic exercise protocols on hormone levels to not be different. It showed increases in testosterone and cortisol immediately after exercise that returned to baseline in 2 hours.<ref name="arbcvsanrbc">{{Cite pmid|7474044}}</ref>

In trained long term aerobic exercisers, basal androgen levels are unchanged,<ref name="longtermaerobic">{{Cite pmid|4044106}}</ref> or decreased.<ref name="arbcvsanrbc"/><ref name="longtermaerobic2">{{Cite pmid|9763799}}</ref> Acutely, endurance based aerobic efforts cause testosterone to rise.<ref name="jensen">{{Cite pmid|1765061}}</ref>  A year long, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program increased DHT and SHBG in sedentary men age 40-75, but had no effect on other androgens. Both DHT and SHBG increased 14% in exercisers at 3 months, and at 12 months they remained 9% above baseline. SHBG is protective against DHT as it binds free androgen.<ref name="Hawkins">{{Cite pmid|18202581}}</ref>

[[File:TwoDumbbells.JPG|thumb|left|Effects of anaerobic exercise also vary with length of time.]] It is unknown if anaerobic training changes individual hormone profiles, or if conditioned athletes in studies self-selected because of physiologic predisposition to athletic conditioning.<ref>{{cite pmid|3529282}}</ref> There is variation of response to anaerobic stress depending on exercise intensity, age, gender, length of time studied, and time at which serum indices were drawn. Most studies report that testosterone increases or is unchanged acutely, though some even report it to decrease. Anaerobic exercisers have testosterone levels below sedentary controls in cross sectional analysis. Over months to years, levels are stable to slightly increased.

The ratio of testosterone to cortisol can both increase<ref name="Scand2"/> and decrease<ref>{{Cite pmid|3108174}}</ref> during resistance training, depending on intensity of exercise. When comparing men and women in the 30, 50 and 70 year age groups, young and middle aged men showed increased testosterone after exercise, with the latter also having increased cortisol. Elderly men showed no change.<ref name="Hakk age">{{cite pmid |8776203}}</ref> There is a 27% greater testosterone response using protocols with simultaneous use of all four limbs.<ref name="Hakk98">{{Cite pmid|9562359}}</ref> A number of studies have looked at effects of anaerobic exercise over months to years, showing it to be constant or slightly increased.

Training caused no change in total testosterone, but there were decreases in free testosterone, [[progesterone]], [[androstendione]], [[DHEA]], cortisol, [[transcortin]], and in the [[Cortisol binding globulin|cortisol:CBG]] ratio, suggesting androgen turnover increased with training intensity, without change in total testosterone.<ref name="Scand2">{{Cite pmid|3410630}}</ref> A study looking at young men and resistance training over 48 weeks found increases in baseline serum testosterone from 20 ± 5 to 25 ± 5 nmol/l, and an increase in testosterone:SHBG ratio, LH and FSH.<ref name="2 year">{{cite pmid|3215840}}</ref>

====Combined training====
One study showed [[Growth hormone|GH]] increase with anaerobic effort to be blunted in those who performed aerobic training for 60 minutes prior to strength training.

====5 alpha reductase inhibitors====

=====Finasteride=====
[[File:Propecia box and tablet.jpg|thumb|upright|''Propecia'' ([[finasteride]]) 1 mg tablets]]

Finasteride (marketed by [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] under the trade names ''Propecia'' and ''Proscar'') is a type-2 [[isoenzyme]] [[5 alpha-reductase]] [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]]. It was originally [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA approved]] for treatment of [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH). Finasteride binds to [[5-alpha-reductase]], preventing conversion of testosterone to DHT. Its effects on androgenic alopecia were not unexpected due to observations of the pseudo-hemaphrodite population in [[Papua, New Guinea]]. Both systemic and topical formulations are effective in androgenic hair loss.<ref>{{cite pmid|19172031}}</ref>

Inhibition of 5α-reductase results in decreased conversion of [[testosterone]] to [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) by reducing the Δ4,5 double-bond. This, also leads to increased levels of testosterone and [[estradiol]]. [[Gynecomastia]], [[erectile dysfunction]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], are some possible side-effects. Other locally expressed enzymes can compensate to a degree, including DHT conversion through reductive 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, oxidative 3a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes.<ref>{{cite pmid|11399532}}</ref>

In clinical studies, finasteride, like [[minoxidil]], is effective at the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] and frontal [[hairline]] area, but more so at the former.<ref name=finasteride1>{{cite pmid|10365924}}</ref> A study over 2 years with 1,553 men between ages 18 and 41 with mild to moderate hair thinning taking 1&nbsp;mg/day showed 83% maintained or increased hair growth.<ref>{{cite pmid|10675111}}</ref> In 1997, the drug was FDA approved for [[male pattern baldness]]. A 5-year study revealed that 9 of 10 men taking finasteride at 1&nbsp;mg/day experienced results. 42% had no further loss while 48% experienced regrowth.<ref>[http://www.propecia.com/finasteride/propecia/consumer/see_the_proof/clinical_study.jsp Proof of results with PROPECIA]</ref>

The drug is [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]],<ref name="micro">{{cite pmid|19016057}}</ref> and development of a liposomal system of finasteride for [[Topical medication|topical application]] has been a subject of recent study, with vehicles shown stable for up to two months in refrigerated preparation.<ref>{{Cite pmid|18161632}}</ref> Topical formulations show some effect in reversal of androgenic effects on hair follicles,<ref name="Topical">{{cite pmid|9449168}}</ref> as well as in hirsutism.<ref>{{Cite pmid|1250761}}</ref> Studies of transgenic mice have shown hair regrowth with topical administration.<ref>{{Cite pmid|10601691}}</ref> More recent studies have looked at microemulsions<ref name="micro"/> and liquid crystalline [[nanoparticles]] for topical finasteride delivery. In the latter, addition of glycerol, propylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol 400, increased finasteride permeation, while addition of [[oleic acid]] made it decrease.<ref>{{cite pmid|23207960}}</ref> Topical 0.1% finasteride in combination with topical 3% minoxidil is more effective than topical minoxidil alone.<ref name=Combined1>{{cite pmid|23193746}}</ref> Small studies of topical finasteride formulations in combination with other drugs have also been found effective.<ref name=Combined2>{{Cite pmid|22363845}}</ref> Surfactants have been shown to aid topical absorption.<ref>{{cite pmid|19929166}}</ref> Topical finasteride gel has been shown an effective route of administration.<ref>{{Cite pmid|19172031}}</ref> Of note, the studies evaluating topical finasteride did not correlate with serum [[Prostate specific antigen|PSA]] in humans, or prostatic weight in animal studies to see if effects were related to systemic absorption. Other studies have shown lower doses of topical finasteride to be less effective.<ref>{{Cite pmid|10927075}}</ref> The medication is not entirely benign. Some patients experience neurologic or psychiatric sequellae after discontinuation of the drug, a condition described in medical literature as 'post-finasteride syndrome'.<ref>{{cite pmid|22939118}}</ref>

=====Dutasteride=====
[[File:Avodart.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Avodart'' ([[dutasteride]]) 500 [[Microgram|µg]] capsules]]

Dutasteride (trademark name ''Avodart'', manufactured by [[GlaxoSmithKline]]) is [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|approved]] for the treatment of [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH), and used off label for androgenic alopecia.<ref>[http://emc.medicines.org.uk/emc/assets/c/html/DisplayDoc.asp?DocumentID=11618 Avodart 0.5 mg soft capsules | SPC from the eMC]</ref> It is a [[5-alpha-reductase inhibitor|dual 5-a reductase inhibitor]] that [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibits conversion]] of [[testosterone]] to [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT). The drug inhibits all three isoforms of 5-alpha reductase, whereas finasteride only inhibits type II and III.

Phase I and II clinical trials for dutasteride as a [[Baldness|hair loss]] drug were started, but discontinued in late 2002 for unknown reasons. Phase II studies showed that dutasteride, at both 0.5&nbsp;mg and 2.5&nbsp;mg per day, showed a superior hair count as compared to finasteride 5&nbsp;mg at 3 and 6 months.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Olsen EA, Hordinsky M, Whiting D, ''et al.'' |title=The importance of dual 5alpha-reductase inhibition in the treatment of MPB: results of a randomized placebo-controlled study of dutasteride versus finasteride |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol. |volume=55 |issue=6 |pages=1014–23 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17110217 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2006.05.007 }}</ref>

Phase II results at 24 weeks showed placebo to decrease by 32 hairs, dutasteride 0.5&nbsp;mg to increase an average of 95 hairs, while the dutasteride 2.5&nbsp;mg group increasing by 110 hairs. GlaxoSmithKline ran a phase III, six month study in [[Korea]] to test the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of a once-daily dutasteride at 0.5&nbsp;mg. They looked at [[male pattern baldness]] (MPB) at the vertex of the scalp, types III, IV and V on the [[Hamilton-Norwood scale]]. The study completed in January 2009.<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00441116}}</ref><ref>[http://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(09)01213-4/abstract Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily in male patients with male pattern hair loss: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study | Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (JAAD)]</ref> Future intentions by GlaxoSmithKline for [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]] approval of dutasteride in androgenic alopecia are unknown.

=====Alfatradiol=====
Alfatradiol is a topical 5α-reductase inhibitor that has been shown to slow progression of hair loss in women.<ref>{{ cite pmid|17451383}}</ref> It is marketed as Avixis, ELL Cranell Alpha and Pantostin.<ref>[[Alfatradiol]]</ref>

====Other topical treatments====
Minoxidil and [[ketoconazole]] are two long standing topical treatments of androgenic alopecia, with only the former having [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval for androgenic alopecia in the [[United States]]. Ketoconazole is also used as an anti-fungal in the treatment of [[tinea capitis]].

=====Minoxidil=====
[[Minoxidil]] (''Rogaine'') is a [[vasodilator]]. It was originally used as the oral drug Loniten to treat [[hypertension]], and discovered to cause hair growth as a side effect. [[Upjohn]] received FDA approval to market a topical solution that contained 2% minoxidil as Rogaine, marketed outside the United States as Regaine.

It is effective at both the front and scalp vertex. In a 12 month study, vertex improvements were seen in 51% of men using 5% minoxidil, 42% using 2% minoxidil, and 13% of placebo users. Moderate to great increases in hair growth were seen in the frontal scalp regions of 19% of men using 5% minoxidil, 10% using 2% minoxidil, and 3% of placebo.<ref>[http://www.modernmedicine.com/modernmedicine/blog/blogList.jsp?id=51115 Beyond the Vertex – Objective evidence shows minoxidil's frontal-scalp performance | ModernMedicine]</ref> Although a mitogen for dormant [[telogen]] follicles, minoxidil can cause hairs in later phases of the [[cell cycle]] to shed early. This is often followed by growth of new, thicker hairs. The mitogenic effect is temporary and does not appear to change follicular structure, leading to indefinite minoxidil application to maintain growth.<ref name="Austria-Codex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Jasek, W|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag |location=Vienna |year=2007 |edition=2007/2008 |volume=4 |page=9673 |isbn=978-3-85200-181-4 |language=German}}</ref> Use of minoxidil without propylene glycol as a vehicle can reduce associated itching.<ref>{{cite pmid|17761356}}</ref> The drug can also be combined with other active ingredients such as tretinoin.<ref name="pmid22735503">{{cite pmid|22735503}}</ref>

====Anti-androgens====
Ketoconazole is a mild topical anti-androgen available [[over-the-counter drug|over the counter]] and in prescription strength in the United States. It is established as treatment for [[tinea capitis]], but also has anti-androgenic and microfloral benefit in androgenic hair loss. Spironolactone and flutamide are potent topical and systemic anti-androgens, typically not used in men as they have a high incidence of feminizing side effects.<ref name="Spirono2">{{cite pmid|20510769}}</ref> They can be prescribed [[off-label use|off-label]] as part of a more aggressive medical regimens, and are effective in female androgenic hair loss.<ref name="Spirono">{{cite pmid|21413648}}</ref>

===== Ketoconazole =====
[[Ketoconazole]] is a topical anti-fungal agent. As an [[imidazole]], ketoconazole is effective for the treatment of dermatitis and dandruff, and its action on scalp microflora may benefit those with AGA associated follicular inflammation.<ref name="pmid22735503">{{cite pmid|22735503}}</ref><ref name="Keto1">{{cite pmid|9669136}}</ref><ref name="Keto2">{{cite pmid|22134564}}</ref> It is also an anti-androgen, and may improve hair growth in AGA through androgen dependent pathways.<ref name="Keto3">{{cite pmid|16997533}}</ref>

=====Spironolactone=====
Spironolactone is a possible selective androgen receptor modulator,<ref>{{cite pmid|22665559}}</ref> and both reduces adrenal androgen production and exerts competitive blockade on androgen receptors in target tissues.<ref name="Spirono2"/> It can be administered topically or systemically. In addition to anti-androgenic activity, it increases estrogen production, which in turn increases production of [[Sex hormone binding globulin|SHBG]]. SHBG binds free DHT and decreases free androgen indices.<ref>{{cite pmid|22890743}}</ref> Due to its feminizing side effects and risk of infertility in men<ref>{{cite pmid|6141923}}</ref> It is used more often in female androgenic alopecia,<ref>{{cite pmid|22171680}}</ref> particularly [[polycystic ovary syndrome|PCOS]].<ref>{{cite pmid|20186113}}</ref> As it is also an [[Antihypertensive drug|anti-hypertensive]], patients need to be monitored for [[hyperkalemia]] and associated [[cardiac dysrhythmia]]. Also, women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant generally cannot use the medication as it is a [[teratogen]], and can cause ambiguous genitalia in newborns.<ref name="Spirono"/>

=====Flutamide=====
Flutamide has more anti-androgenic activity than spironolactone, and is also referred to as [[chemical castration]]. It can cause marked reduction in libido and estrogenic side effects including gynecomastia, lipid profile changes, and emotional lability, although when used in women it can be associated with increased positive affect. There is a significant incidence of hepatic dysfunction with the medication in women.<ref>{{cite pmid|21487083}}</ref> Like spironolactone, it is more often used clinically in female androgenic alopecia.<ref>{{cite pmid|21605098}}</ref>

===Hair transplantation===
{{Main|Hair transplantation}}
{{double image|right|Man before receiving hair transplant.jpg|250|Man after receiving hair transplant.jpg |230|A man before and after a hair transplant.}}Hair transplantation is a [[surgery|surgical]] technique that moves individual [[hair follicle]]s from a part of the body called the 'donor site' to bald or balding part of the body known as the 'recipient site'. It is primarily used to treat [[male pattern baldness]]. In this condition, grafts containing hair follicles that are genetically resistant to balding are transplanted to bald scalp. It is also used to restore [[eyelash]]es, [[eyebrow]]s, beard hair, chest hair, and pubic hair and to fill in scars caused by accidents or surgery such as face-lifts and previous hair transplants. Hair transplantation differs from [[skin graft]]ing in that grafts contain almost all of the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and [[dermis]] surrounding the hair follicle, and many tiny grafts are transplanted rather than a single strip of skin.

Since hair naturally grows in follicles in groups of 1 to 4 hairs, [[Organ transplant|transplant]]ation takes advantage of these naturally occurring follicular units. This achieves a more natural appearance by matching hair for hair through [[Follicular unit transplantation|Follicular Unit Transplantation]] (FUT).

Donor hair can be harvested in two different ways. Small grafts of naturally-occurring units of one to four hairs, called [[hair follicle|follicular units]], can be moved to balding areas of the [[hair restoration]]. These follicular units are surgically implanted in the scalp in very close proximity to one another and in large numbers. The grafts are obtained in one or both of the two primary methods of surgical extraction, [[Follicular unit transplantation|Follicular Unit Transplantation]] (FUT), colloquially referred to as 'strip harvesting,' or [[Follicular Unit Extraction]] (FUE), in which follicles are transplanted individually.

In FUT, a strip of skin containing many follicular units is extracted from the patient and dissected under stereoscopic microscope. Once divided into follicular unit grafts, the surgeon implants each individually into small recipient sites made by incision at the bald scalp. In newer technique, roots are extracted from the donor area and divided into strips for transplantation. The strip, two to three millimeters thick, is isolated and transplanted to bald scalp.<ref>{{Cite pmid|23031379}}</ref> After surgery, bandaging is worn for two days for healing.<ref>{{Cite pmid|22808618}}</ref>

More recently, bioengineered hair follicles have been successfully transplanted to create histologically normal hair follicles. Specifically, bioengineered hair follicle germ, which was reconstituted with embryonic skin-derived epithelial and mesenchymal cells were ectopically transplanted. On histology, the bioengineered hair follicles also autonomously connected with nerves and the arrector pili muscle at the permanent region and exhibited piloerection ability.<ref>{{Cite pmid|22645640}}</ref>

===Experimental medication===
{{Main|Management of androgenic alopecia#Experimental medication}}
[[File:Thai peppers.jpg|thumb|left|[[Capsaicin]] is the active ingredient in chili pepper, with animal studies showing it to affect hair regrowth.]]The field of research to prevent and treat androgenic hair loss is vast, with systemic and topical therapies with varying degrees of efficacy. In the United States alone, it is a multi-billion dollar industry. The entire field of research cannot be appropriately addressed in a single article, but the following section discusses those with the greatest degree of peer reviewed research and recognition.

''In vitro'', when [[supernatant]] from HIF-1 transfected fibroblast cells was administered to hair follicle cells, it induced [[Vascular endothelial growth factor|VEGF]], which had stimulatory effects on hair follicle cells. VEGF promotes growth of blood vessels, which would be an appropriate response to low oxygen conditions.<ref>{{cite pmid|17536272}}</ref> Other studies have suggested hypoxia initiates a potentially self-perpetuating cycle involving HIF, VEGF, and [[AKT]] activation. [[Ciclopirox]], otherwise known as ciclopiroxolamine, is used as a topical shampoo, has anti-fungal properties, and may induce HIF-1.<ref>{{cite pmid|17146583}}</ref>

In December 2012, topical application of IGF-1 in a liposomal vehicle led to thicker and more rapid hair growth in transgenic mice with androgenic alopecia.

Piroctone olamine is a topical agent that has similar efficacy to 1% ketoconazole in small controlled trials. In 2012, scientists found the [[lipid]] [[prostaglandin D2]] (PGD2) in balding male scalps at levels higher than controls, and theorized it prevented hair follicles maturation.

[[Image:WNTPathway.png|thumb|right|upright|Androgens interact with the [[Wnt signalling pathway]] to cause hair loss; researchers are also affecting the pathway in animal models.]]In May 2007, U.S. company Follica Inc licensed technology from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] to regenerate hair follicles by reawakening [[genes]] from [[embryo]]nic development. Studies began with the study of hair regrowth in wound healing in mice when [[Wnt protein]]s were introduced. Time to development of pharmaceutical treatment is expected to take several years.<ref>[http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/news/News_Releases/may07/hair-follicle-regeneration.html First Demonstration of New Hair Follicle Generation in an Animal Model | PENN Medicine News]</ref><ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18703259/ Study offers hope of baldness remedy | msnbc.com]</ref> In other methods, cells are cultured and the supernatant is processed to produce a compound rich in hair growth promoting factors, like Wnt proteins. This approach is still in Phase I or II trials. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) isolated from whole blood can be used for its growth factors and stimulatory mediators. Some hair transplant surgeons use this product to encourage transplanted graft growth.<ref name="pmid 21792780"/> PRP is also available as a standalone treatment for AGA, though there is only one small study to date in its support.<ref>{{cite pmid|21883644}}</ref>

===Laser therapy===
There is some evidence that laser light can stimulate hair growth at some wavelengths.<ref>{{cite pmid|21812832}}</ref> With one exception,<ref>{{cite pmid|19366270}}</ref> however, there is limited clinical evidence of their benefit.<ref>{{cite pmid|20689478}}</ref>

====Copper complexes====
Topical copper complexes such as Tricomin have been reported successful in preventing hair follicle death.

===Dietary supplements===
{{Main|Management of androgenic alopecia#Dietary supplements}}
The [[dietary supplement]] industry is distinct from the pharmaceutical industry, and is more loosely regulated than [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approved medications. The most commonly used and well researched plants are saw palmetto (''Serenoa repens''), stinging nettle (''Urtica dioica''), turmeric (''Curcubita pepo''), and ''[[Pygeum africanum]]''.<ref>{{Cite pmid|22512478}}</ref> Other herbs include [[black cohosh]] (''Actaea racemosa''), [[Angelica sinensis|dong quai]] (''Angelica sinensis''), [[Chamaelirium|false unicorn]] (''Chamaelirium luteum''), [[Vitex agnus-castus|chasteberry]] (''Vitex agnus-castus''), and [[Trifolium pratense|red clover]] (Trifolium pratense).

===Stem cell therapy===
Although follicles were previously thought gone in areas of complete baldness, they are more likely dormant, as recent studies have shown the scalp contains the [[stem cell]]s from which the follicles arose.<ref>{{cite pmid|21206086}}</ref> Research on these follicular stem cells may lead to successes in treating baldness through ''hair multiplication'' (HM), also known as ''hair cloning''.

==Tinea capitis==
[[File:Teigne - Tinea capitis.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tinea capitis]] can mimic alopecia areata.]] [[Tinea capitis]] is a superficial [[fungus|fungal]] [[mycosis|infection]] ([[dermatophytosis]]) of the [[scalp]], and can mimic alopecia areata.<ref name="isbn0-07-138076-0">{{cite book |author=Freedberg IM, Fitzpatrick TB. |title=Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine |publisher=McGraw-Hill, Medical Pub. Division |location=New York |year=2003 |page=645 |isbn=0-07-138076-0}}</ref> The disease is primarily caused by [[dermatophytes]] in the ''[[Trichophyton]]'' and ''[[Microsporum]]'' genera that invade the hair shaft. The clinical presentation is typically a single or multiple patches of hair loss, sometimes with a 'black dot' pattern (often with broken-off hairs), that may be accompanied by inflammation, scaling, pustules, and itching. Uncommon in adults, tinea capitis is predominantly seen in pre-[[puberty|pubertal]] children, more often in boys than girls.<ref>{{Cite pmid|19678603}}</ref>

At least eight species of dermatophytes are associated with tinea capitis. Cases of ''Trichophyton'' infection predominate from Central America to the United States and in parts of Western Europe. Infections from ''Microsporum'' species are mainly in South America, Southern and Central Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The disease is infectious and can be transmitted by humans, animals, or objects that harbor the fungus. The fungus can also exist in a carrier state on the scalp, without clinical symptomatology. Treatment of tinea capitis requires an oral [[Antifungal medication|antifungal agent]]; [[griseofulvin]] is the most commonly used drug, but other newer antimycotic drugs, such as [[terbinafine]], [[itraconazole]], and [[fluconazole]] have started to gain acceptance.
