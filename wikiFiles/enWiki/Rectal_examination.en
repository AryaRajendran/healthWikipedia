A '''rectal examination''' or '''rectal exam''' is an internal examination of the [[rectum]] such as by a [[physician]] or other healthcare professional.

==Procedure==
The '''digital rectal examination''' (DRE, Latin ''palpatio per anum'' or PPA) is a relatively simple procedure.  The patient undresses, then is placed in a position where the [[anus]] is accessible (lying on the side, squatting on the examination table, bent over the examination table, or lying down with feet in stirrups).

If the patient is lying on their side, the physician will usually have them bring one or both legs up to their chest.  If the patient bends over the examination table, the physician will have them place their elbows on the table and squat down slightly.   If the patient uses the supine position, the physician will ask the patient to slide down to the end of the examination table until their buttocks are positioned just beyond the end.   The patient then places their feet in the stirrups.

The physician spreads the buttocks apart and will usually examine the external area (anus and perinium) for any abnormalities such as [[hemorrhoids]], lumps, or rashes.  Then, as the patient relaxes, the physician slips a gloved and lubricated [[finger]] into the rectum through the anus and [[Palpation|palpates]] the insides for approximately sixty seconds.

==Usage==
This examination may be used:
* for the diagnosis of rectal [[tumor]]s and other forms of [[cancer]];
* for the diagnosis of [[prostate|prostatic]] disorders, notably [[tumor]]s and [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]];<ref name="Chodak-1989">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Chodak | first1 = GW. | last2 = Keller | first2 = P. | last3 = Schoenberg | first3 = HW. | title = Assessment of screening for prostate cancer using the digital rectal examination. | journal = J Urol | volume = 141 | issue = 5 | pages = 1136–8 | month = May | year = 1989 | doi =  | PMID = 2709500 }}</ref><ref name="SchroderKruger1998">{{cite journal|last1=Schroder|first1=F.

* for the [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of [[appendicitis]] or other examples of an [[acute abdomen]] (i.e. acute abdominal symptoms indicating a serious underlying disease);
* for the estimation of the [[tonicity]] of the [[anus|anal]] [[sphincter]], which may be useful  in case of [[fecal incontinence]] or [[neurologic]] diseases, including traumatic spinal cord injuries;
* in [[female]]s, for [[gynecology|gynecological]] palpations of internal organs;
* for examination of the hardness and color of the feces (i.e. in cases of constipation, and [[fecal impaction]]);
* prior to a [[colonoscopy]] or [[proctoscopy]];
* to evaluate [[hemorrhoids]];
* In newborns to exclude [[anal atresia|imperforate anus]].

The DRE is frequently combined with an FOBT ([[faecal occult blood|fecal occult blood test]]), which may be useful for diagnosing the etiology of an [[anemia]] and/or confirming a [[gastrointestinal bleed]].

The DRE is inadequate as a screening tool for colorectal cancer because it examines less than 10% of the colorectal mucosa; [[sigmoidoscopy]] is preferred. However, it is an important part of a general examination, as many tumors or other diseases are made manifest in the [[distal]] part of the [[rectum]].

Sometimes [[proctoscopy]] may also be part of a rectal examination.

==Veterinary medicine==
In [[veterinary medicine]] rectal examination is useful in [[dog]]s for analysis of the [[prostate]] (as in men), pelvic [[urethra]], sublumbar [[lymph node]]s, and [[anal glands]].  In [[horses]] it is a vital component of the clinical examination for [[equine colic|colic]], to determine the presence or absence of bowel torsion, [[impaction]], or displacement. When horses undergo a rectal examination there is a small risk of a [[rectal]] tear occurring, which can be a life-threatening event, rapidly leading to [[peritonitis]] and [[septic shock]].  It is also a common procedure in cattle, and is one method of diagnosing pregnancy in both the horse and the cow.

The procedure in dogs and cats is similar to humans.  For the horse, the patient stands in a [[stock (cage)|stock]] and may be sedated.  The examiner puts on a long glove that extends to the shoulder. The examiner inserts the hand and arm into the rectum as far as necessary.

==Popular culture==
Due to the taboos surrounding the anus, and the potential for discomfort and embarrassment, the rectal exam is a common [[comedic device]]. Generally, it is not shown directly, but implied as the examiner dons and lubricates a glove while behind the patient. The ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode [[Stewie Loves Lois]] even uses the rectal exam as the main plot, when [[Peter Griffin]], not realizing it is a routine medical procedure for checking for [[prostate cancer]], thinks he is being "raped". The [[body cavity search]] is frequently used the same way.
