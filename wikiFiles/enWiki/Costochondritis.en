'''Costochondritis,''' also known as '''chest wall pain''', '''costosternal syndrome''', or '''costosternal chondrodynia'''<ref name="Mayo"/> is a benign<ref name="chest pain"/> and often temporary [[inflammation]] of the [[costal cartilage]], which connects each rib to the [[Human sternum|sternum]] at the [[costosternal joint]], and is a common cause of [[chest pain]].<ref name="Mayo">{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/costochondritis/DS00626 |title=Costochondritis Definition |author=Mayo Clinic Staff |year=2012 |work= |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref><ref name="Medline">{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000164.htm |title=Costochondritis |author=U.S. National Library of Medicine |year=2010 |work= |publisher=National Institutes of Health |accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref><ref name="Family">{{cite journal |year=2009 |last1=Proulx |first1=AM |last2=Zryd |first2=TW |journal=American Family Physician |volume=80|issue=6 |pages=617–620 |pmid=19817327 |title=Costochondritis: diagnosis and treatment}}</ref> Though costochondritis is often self-limited, it can be a recurring condition that can appear to have little or no signs of onset.<ref>{{cite journal |year=2010 |last1=Stochkendahl |first1=MJ |last2=Christensen |first2=HW |journal=The Medical clinics of North America|volume=94|issue=2 |pages=259–273 |pmid=20380955|doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2010.01.007. |title=Chest pain in focal musculoskeletal disorders}}</ref>  Treatment options are quite limited and usually involve a combination of rest, [[analgesic]]s, or anti-inflammatory medications;<ref name="Harrisons"/> however, in cases with intractable discomfort, [[cortisone]] injections<ref name="Harrisons"/><ref name="Keck"/> or surgery may be necessary.

==Etiology==
In most cases of costochondritis, there is no definite cause.<ref name="Mayo"/><ref name="chest pain"/><ref name="Keck">{{cite web |url=http://keckmedicalcenterofusc.org/condition/document/96919 |title=Costochondritis |author=Ricker Polsdorfer, M.D. |year=2012 |work= |publisher=Keck Medical Center of USC |accessdate=30 December 2012}}</ref> However, costochondritis may be the result of physical trauma (direct injury, [[Weight training|strenuous lifting]], or severe bouts of coughing), [[ankylosing spondylitis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[osteoarthritis]], [[septic arthritis|infection of the affected joint]], or a [[Neoplasm|tumor]] (benign or cancerous).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/costochondritis/DS00626/DSECTION=causes |title=Causes |author=Mayo Clinic Staff |year=2012 |work= |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
Pain or tenderness to palpation usually occur on the sides of the sternum, affect multiple ribs, and are often worsened with coughing, deep breathing, or physical activity.<ref name="chest pain"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/costochondritis/DS00626/DSECTION=symptoms|title=Costochondritis:Symptoms |author=Mayo Clinic Staff|year=2012 |work= |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>  On physical examination, physicians will inspect and palpate the patient for areas of swelling or tenderness and can often reproduce the pain associated with costochondritis by moving the patient's [[rib cage]] or arms.<ref name="Family"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/costochondritis/DS00626/DSECTION=tests%2Dand%2Ddiagnosis|title=Costochondritis:Tests and diagnosis |author=Mayo Clinic Staff|year=2012 |work= |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref> Costochondritis tends to occur in patients who are aged between 20 and 40, typically female, and tends to affect the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth costosternal joints.<ref name="chest pain">{{cite journal |pmid=21541647 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21541647 |year=2011 |last1=Jindal |first1=A |last2=Singhi |first2=S|title=Acute chest pain. |volume=78 |issue=10 |pages=1262–1267 |journal=Indian journal of pediatrics |doi=10.1007/s12098-011-0413-1}}</ref><ref name="Harrisons"/>

==Treatment==
Costochondritis may be treated with physical therapy (with or without nerve stimulation) or with medication. Treatment may involve the use of [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] such as [[ibuprofen]] or other pain relief medications ([[analgesics]]) such as [[acetaminophen]].<ref name="Medline"/><ref name="Family"/> Severe cases of costochondritis may call for the use of [[opioid]] medications such as [[hydrocodone]] or [[oxycodone]], [[tricyclic antidepressant]] medications such as [[amitryptyline]] may be used to treat pain from chronic costochondritis, and [[anti-epileptic drugs]] such as [[gabapentin]] may be used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/costochondritis/DS00626/DSECTION=treatments%2Dand%2Ddrugs |title=Treatments and drugs |author= |year=2012 |work= |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>  Patients are often instructed to rest from stressful physical activity while recovering.<ref name="Family"/>
