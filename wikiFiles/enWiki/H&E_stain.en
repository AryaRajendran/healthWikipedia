'''Hematoxylin and eosin stain''' ('''H&E stain''' or '''HE stain''') is a popular [[staining]] method in [[histology]]. It is the most widely used stain in medical diagnosis; for example when a [[pathologist]] looks at a [[biopsy]] of a suspected [[cancer]], the [[histological section]] is likely to be stained with H&E and termed "H&E section", "H+E section", or "HE section".

The staining method involves application of '''hemalum''', which is a complex formed from aluminum ions and [[hematein]], which is an oxidation product of [[haematoxylin]]. Hemalum colors nuclei of cells (and a few other objects, such as [[keratohyalin]] granules) and calcified material) blue. The nuclear staining is followed by counterstaining with an aqueous or alcoholic solution of [[eosin Y]], which colors other, [[eosinophilic]] structures in various shades of red, pink and orange.

The staining of nuclei by hemalum is ordinarily due to binding of the dye-metal complex to DNA, but nuclear staining can be obtained after extraction of DNA from tissue sections. The mechanism is different from that of nuclear staining by basic (cationic) dyes such as thionine or toluidine blue. Staining by basic dyes occurs only from solutions that are less acidic than hemalum, and it is prevented by prior chemical or enzymatic extraction of nucleic acids. There is evidence toindicate that coordinate bonds, similar to those that hold aluminum and hematein together, bind the hemalum complex to DNA and to carboxy groups of proteins in the nuclear [[chromatin]].

The eosinophilic structures are generally composed of intracellular or extracellular [[protein]]. The [[Lewy body|Lewy bodies]] and [[Mallory body|Mallory bodies]] are examples of eosinophilic structures. Most of the [[cytoplasm]] is eosinophilic. [[Red blood cell]]s are stained intensely red.

The structures do not have to be acidic or basic to be called basophilic and eosinophilic. The terminology is based on the affinity to the dyes. Other colors, e.g. yellow and brown, can be present in the sample; they are caused by intrinsic pigments, e.g. [[melanin]]. Some structures do not stain well. [[Basal lamina]]e need to be stained by [[PAS stain]] or some [[silver stain]]s, if they have to be well visible. [[Reticular fiber]]s also require silver stain. Hydrophobic structures also tend to remain clear; these are usually rich in fats, e.g. [[adipocyte]]s, [[myelin]] around [[neuron]] [[axon]]s, and [[Golgi apparatus]] membranes.
