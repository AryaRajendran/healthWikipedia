'''Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance''' (MGUS , ''unknown'' or ''uncertain'' may be substituted for ''undetermined''), formerly '''benign monoclonal gammopathy''', is a condition in which a [[paraprotein]] is found in the blood during standard laboratory tests. It resembles [[multiple myeloma]] and similar diseases, but the levels of antibody are lower, the number of [[plasma cells]] (white blood cells that secrete antibodies) in the bone marrow is lower, it has no symptoms or problems, and no treatment is indicated. However, [[multiple myeloma]] develops at the rate of about 1-2% a year, so doctors recommend monitoring it yearly. In rare cases, it may also be related with a slowly progressive symmetric distal sensorimotor [[neuropathy]].

==Diagnosis==
MGUS is a common, age-related medical condition characterized by an accumulation of bone marrow plasma cells derived from a single abnormal clone.  Patients may be diagnosed with MGUS if they fulfill the following three criteria:<ref>{{cite journal | author =International Myeloma Working Group | title = Criteria for the classification of monoclonal gammopathies, [[multiple myeloma]] and related disorders: a report of the International Myeloma Working Group | journal = Br J Haematol | volume = 121 | issue = 5 | pages = 749–757 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12780789 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04355.x}}</ref>

#A monoclonal paraprotein band less than 30 g/L (< 3g/dL);
#[[Plasma cell]]s less than 10% on [[bone marrow examination]];
#No evidence of bone lesions, [[anemia]], [[hypercalcemia]], or [[renal insufficiency]] related to the paraprotein, and
#No evidence of another B-cell proliferative disorder.

===Differential diagnosis===
Several other illnesses can present with a monoclonal gammopathy, and the monoclonal protein may be the first discovery before a formal diagnosis is made:
* [[Multiple myeloma]]
* [[AIDS]]
* [[Chronic lymphocytic leukemia]]

==Pathology==
Pathologically, the lesion in MGUS is in fact very similar to that in multiple myeloma.  There is a predominance of [[Clone (B-cell biology)|clonal]] [[plasma cell]]s in the [[bone marrow]] with an abnormal [[immunophenotype]] ([[CD38]]+ [[CD56]]+ [[CD19]]&minus;) mixed in with cells of a normal phenotype (CD38+ CD56&minus; CD19+);<ref>{{cite journal | author = Zhan F, Hardin J, Kordsmeier B, Bumm K, Zheng M, Tian E, Sanderson R, Yang Y, Wilson C, Zangari M, Anaissie E, Morris C, Muwalla F, van Rhee F, Fassas A, Crowley J, Tricot G, Barlogie B, Shaughnessy J | title = Global gene expression profiling of multiple myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, and normal bone marrow plasma cells | journal = Blood | volume = 99 | issue = 5 | pages = 1745–1757 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11861292 | url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/content/full/99/5/1745 | doi = 10.1182/blood.V99.5.1745}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Magrangeas F, Nasser V, Avet-Loiseau H, Loriod B, Decaux O, Granjeaud S, Bertucci F, Birnbaum D, Nguyen C, Harousseau J, Bataille R, Houlgatte R, Minvielle S | title = Gene expression profiling of multiple myeloma reveals molecular portraits in relation to the pathogenesis of the disease | journal = Blood | volume = 101 | issue = 12 | pages = 4998–5006 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12623842 | url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/content/full/101/12/4998 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2002-11-3385}}</ref> in MGUS, on average more than 3% of the clonal plasma cells have the normal phenotype, whereas in multiple myeloma, less than 3% of the cells have the normal phenotype.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ocqueteau M, Orfao A, Almeida J, Bladé J, González M, García-Sanz R, López-Berges C, Moro M, Hernández J, Escribano L, Caballero D, Rozman M, San Miguel J | title = Immunophenotypic characterization of plasma cells from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance patients.

==Prognosis==
At the Mayo Clinic, MGUS transformed into multiple myeloma or similar myeloproliferative disorder at the rate of about 1-2% a year, or 17%, 34%, and 39% at 10, 20, and 25 years, respectively, of follow-up—among surviving patients. However, because they were elderly, most patients with MGUS died of something else and did not go on to develop multiple myeloma. When this was taken into account, only 11.2% developed myeloproliferative disorders.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bladé J | title = Clinical practice.

Kyle studied the prevalence of myeloma in the population as a whole (not clinic patients) in [[Olmsted County, Minnesota]]. They found that the prevalence of MGUS was 3.2% in people above 50, with a slight male predominance (4.0% vs. 2.7%). Prevalence increased with age: of people over 70 up to 5.3% had MGUS, while in the over-85 age group the prevalence was 7.5%.  In the majority of cases (63.5%), the paraprotein level was &lt;1 g/dl, while only a very small group had levels over 2 g/dl.<ref name="Kyle">{{cite journal | author=Kyle RA, Therneau TM, Rajkumar SV, Larson DR, Plevak MF, Offord JR, Dispenzieri A, Katzmann JA, Melton LJ 3rd. | title=Prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance | journal=N Engl J Med | year=2006 | month=28 December | volume=354 | pages=1362–1369 | pmid=16571879 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa054494 | issue=13}}</ref> A study of monoclonal protein levels conducted in [[Ghana]] showed a prevalence of MGUS of approximately 5.9% in African men over the age of 50.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.4065/82.12.1468 | author=Landgren O, Katzmann JA, Hsing AW, Pfeiffer RM, Kyle RA, Yeboah ED, Biritwum RB, Tettey Y, Adjei AA, Larson DR, Dispenzieri A, Melton LJ 3rd, Goldin LR, McMaster ML, Caporaso NE, Rajkumar SV. | title=Prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance among men in Ghana | journal=Mayo Clin Proc | year=2007 | month=Dec | volume=82 | pmid=18053453 | issue=12 | pages=1468–1473}}</ref>

In 2009, prospective data demonstrated that all or almost all cases of Multiple Myeloma are preceded by MGUS.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Landgren O, Kyle RA, Pfeiffer RM, Katzmann JA, Caporaso NE, Hayes RB, Dispenzieri A, Kumar S, Clark RJ, Baris D, Hoover R, Rajkumar SV. | title=Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) consistently precedes multiple myeloma: a prospective study | journal=Blood | year=2009 | month=28 May | volume=113 | pmid=19179464 | pages=5412–7 | doi=10.1182/blood-2008-12-194241 | issue=22 | pmc=2689042 | unused_data=pages5412-7}}</ref> In addition to multiple myeloma, MGUS may also progress to [[Waldenström's macroglobulinemia]], primary [[amyloidosis]], [[B-cell lymphoma]], or [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]].

== Management ==

The [[protein electrophoresis]] test should be repeated annually, and if there is any concern for a rise in the level of monoclonal protein, then prompt referral to a [[hematologist]] is required. The hematologist, when first evaluating a case of MGUS, will usually perform a [[skeletal survey]] (X-rays of the proximal skeleton), check the blood for [[hypercalcemia]] and deterioration in [[renal function]], check the urine for [[bence jones protein|Bence Jones]] protein and perform a [[bone marrow biopsy]].  If none of these tests are abnormal, a patient with MGUS is followed up once every 6 months to a year with a blood test (serum protein electrophoresis).
