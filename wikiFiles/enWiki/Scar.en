'''Scars''' are areas of fibrous tissue ([[fibrosis]]) that replace normal [[skin]] after injury. A scar results from the biological process of [[wound]] repair in the skin and other [[biological tissue|tissues]] of the body. Thus, scarring is a natural part of the [[healing]] process. With the exception of very minor [[lesion]]s, every wound (e.g. after [[accident]], [[disease]], or [[surgery]]) results in some degree of scarring. An exception to this is animals with [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], which do not form scars and the tissue will grow back exactly as before.

Scar tissue is the exact same protein (collagen)<ref name=collagenskinscar2010-08-20/> as the tissue that it replaces,<ref name=collagenskinscar2010-08-20>{{Cite web

==Etymology==
First attested in English in late 14th century, the word ''scar'' derives from [[Old French]] ''escharre'', from [[Late Latin]] ''eschara'',<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Deschara eschara], 
Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus</ref> which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἐσχάρα (''eskhara''), meaning "hearth, fireplace", but in medicine "scab, eschar on a wound caused by burning or otherwise".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29sxa%2Fra ἐσχάρα], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on perseus</ref><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=scar Online Etymology Dictionary]</ref>

== Types ==
All scarring is composed of the same collagen as the tissue it has replaced, but the composition of the scar tissue, compared to the normal tissue, is different.<ref name=collagenskinscar2010-08-20/> Scars differ from other scars in the amounts of collagen overexpressed. Labels have been applied to the differences in overexpression. Two of the most common types are hypertrophic and [[keloid]] scarring,<ref name=Roseborough2004/> both of which experience excessive stiff collagen bundled growth overextending the tissue, blocking off regeneration of tissues. Another form is atrophic scarring (sunken scarring), which also has an overexpression of collagen blocking regeneration. This scar type is sunken, because the collagen bundles do not overextend the tissue. Stretch marks (striae) are regarded as scars by some.

=== Hypertrophic ===
{{main|Hypertrophic scars}}
[[Hypertrophic scars]] occur when the body overproduces collagen, which causes the scar to be raised above the surrounding skin. [[Organ hypertrophy|Hypertrophic]] scars take the form of a red raised lump on the skin. They usually occur within 4 to 8 weeks following wound infection or wound closure with excess tension and/or other traumatic skin injuries.<ref name=Roseborough2004>{{cite journal |author=Gauglitz GG, Korting HC, Pavicic T |title=Hypertrophic Scarring and Keloids: Pathomechanisms and Current and Emerging Treatment Strategies |journal=Mol Med |Volume 1 7 |issue= 1-2 |pages=113–125 |month=January-February |doi=10.2119/molmed.2009.00153 |url= http://www.molmed.org}}</ref>

====Keloid====
[[File:Cicatrices de flagellation sur un esclave.jpg|thumb|150px|Keloid scarring on the back of an enslaved African; people with darker skin pigmentations are more prone to the development of keloids.]]
[[Keloid]] scars are a more serious form of hypertrophic scarring, because they can grow indefinitely into large, tumorous (although benign) [[neoplasm]]s.<ref name=Roseborough2004/>

Hypertrophic scars are often distinguished from keloid scars by their lack of growth outside the original wound area, but this commonly taught distinction can lead to confusion.<ref name=Roseborough2004>{{cite journal |author=Roseborough IE, Grevious MA, Lee RC |title=Prevention and treatment of excessive dermal scarring |journal=J Natl Med Assoc |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=108–16 |year=2004 |month=January |pmid=14746360 |pmc=2594768 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Keloid scars are all hypertrophic,<ref name=Roseborough2004/> but "only a small percentage of hypertrophic scars" are keloid.<ref name=Roseborough2004/> 

Keloid scars can occur on anyone, but they are most common in dark-skinned people.<ref>Martini, Frederic H. (2006). ''Fundamentals of Anatomy & Physiology,'' Seventh Edition, p. 171. Benjamin Cummings, San Francisco.</ref> They can be caused by surgery, accident, [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] or, sometimes, [[body piercings]]. In some people, keloid scars form spontaneously. Although they can be a cosmetic problem, keloid scars are only inert masses of collagen and therefore completely harmless and not cancerous. However, they can be itchy or painful in some individuals. They tend to be most common on the [[shoulder]]s and [[chest]]. Hypertrophic scars and its subset keloids tend to be more common in wounds closed by secondary intention.<ref name=secinten201104/>

=== Atrophic ===
An atrophic scar takes the form of a sunken recess in the skin, which has a pitted appearance. These are caused when underlying structures supporting the skin, such as [[fat]] or [[muscle]], are lost. This type of scarring is often associated with acne,<ref>{{cite pmid|10971560}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|20981308}}</ref> [[chickenpox]], other diseases [especially ''Staphylococcus'' (or [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) infection], surgery, or accidents.

=== Stretch marks ===
{{Main|Stretch marks}}
Stretch marks (technically called ''striae'') are also a form of scarring. These are caused when the skin is stretched rapidly (for instance during [[pregnancy]],<ref name="doi10.1002/14651858.CD000066">{{cite doi|10.1002/14651858.CD000066}}</ref> significant weight gain, or adolescent [[growth spurt]]s),<ref>{{cite pmid|19400881}}</ref> or when skin is put under tension during the healing process, (usually near [[joints]]). This type of scar usually improves in appearance after a few years.<ref name="doi10.1002/14651858.CD000066"/>

Elevated [[corticosteroid]] levels are implicated in striae development.<ref>{{cite pmid|16384751}}</ref>

The scar is a result of the body's repair mechanism after injury in many tissues. 

Any injury does not become a scar until the wound has completely healed; this can take many months, or years in the worst pathological cases, such as keloids. To begin to patch the damage, a clot is created; the clot is the beginning process that results in a provisional matrix. In the process, the first layer is a provisional matrix and is not scar. Over time, the wounded body tissue then overexpresses collagen inside the provisional matrix to create a collagen matrix. This collagen overexpression continues and crosslinks the fiber arrangement inside the collagen matrix, making the collagen dense. This densely packed collagen, morphing into an inelastic whitish collagen<ref name="Fibroblast"/> scar wall, blocks off cell communication and regeneration; as a result, the new tissue generated will have a different texture and quality than the surrounding unwounded tissue. This prolonged collagen-producing process results in a fortuna scar. 

The scarring is created by fibroblast proliferation,<ref name="Fibroblast"/> a process that begins with a reaction to the clot.<ref name =Fibroblasts2007-12-17>{{Cite web

Prolonged [[inflammation]], as well as the [[fibroblast]] proliferation<ref name="Fibroblast"/> can occur. Redness that often follows an injury to the skin is not a scar, and is generally not permanent (see [[wound healing]]). The time it takes for this redness to dissipate may, however, range from a few days to, in some serious and rare cases, a few years. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Scars form differently based on the location of the injury on the body and the age of the person who was injured. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The worse the initial damage is, the worse the scar will generally be. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

'''Skin scars''' occur when the [[dermis]] (the deep, thick layer of skin) is damaged. Most skin scars are flat and leave a trace of the original [[injury]] that caused them. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

=== Collagen Induction Therapy ===

[[Collagen induction therapy]] (CIT) is an aesthetic medical procedure that involves repeatedly puncturing the skin with tiny, sterile needles. Typically, this is done with a specialized device called a microneedling device. CIT is often referred to as "microneedling" or "skin needling" in media and literature.

=== Chemical peels ===

Chemical peels are chemicals which destroy the epidermis in a controlled manner, leading to exfoliation and the alleviation of certain skin conditions, including superficial acne scars.<ref>{{cite pmid|18688101}}</ref> Various chemicals can be used depending upon the depth of the peel, and caution should be used, particularly for dark-skinned individuals and those individuals susceptible to keloid formation or with active infections.<ref>Khunger N. Standard guidelines of care for chemical peels. Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol [serial online] 2008 [cited 2010 May 22];74(Suppl):S5-S12. [http://www.ijdvl.com/text.asp?2008/74/7/5/42282 Free full-text].</ref>

=== Filler injections ===
Filler injections of [[collagen]] or [[Artefill]] can be used to raise atrophic scars to the level of surrounding skin.<ref>{{cite pmid|20024872}}</ref> Risks vary based upon the filler used, and can include temporary improvement, further disfigurement, and [[allergic reaction]].<ref>{{cite pmid|16936549}}</ref>

=== Dermabrasion ===
[[Dermabrasion]] involves the removal of the surface of the skin with special equipment, and usually involves a [[local anaesthetic]].

=== Laser treatment ===

Nonablative lasers, such as the 585&nbsp;nm [[pulsed dye laser]], 1064&nbsp;nm and 1320&nbsp;nm [[Nd:YAG]], or the 1540&nbsp;nm [[Er:Glass]] are used as the standard laser therapy for hypertrophic scars and keloids.<ref name="pmid21061757">{{cite pmid|21061757}}</ref> This therapy smooths the epidermis via contact cooling. Multiple sessions are usually required for a significant reduction in redness and improvement in the texture and pliability of hypertrophic scars and keloids. 

Ablative lasers such as the [[carbon dioxide laser]] or [[Er:YAG]] offer the best results for atrophic and acne scars.<ref>{{cite pmid|21401378}}</ref> Like dermabrasion, ablative lasers work by destroying the epidermis to a certain depth. Healing times for ablative therapy are much longer and the risk profile is greater compared to nonablative therapy; however, nonablative therapy offers only minor improvements in cosmetic appearance of atrophic and acne scars.<ref name="pmid21061757"/>

=== Radiotherapy ===
Low-dose, superficial [[radiotherapy]] is sometimes used to prevent recurrence of severe keloid and hypertrophic scarring. It is thought to be effective despite a lack of clinical trials, but only used in extreme cases due to the perceived risk of long-term side effects.<ref>{{cite pmid|19935303}}</ref>

=== Semiocclusive ointments and pressure dressing===

[[Silicone scar sheet|Silicone scar treatments]] are commonly used in preventing scar formation and improving existing scar appearance.<ref>{{cite pmid|20354695}}</ref>  The effectiveness and safety of silicone sheeting for the treatment and prevention of scars is supported by an abundance of clinical studies.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} 

Semiocclusive, silicone-based ointments<ref name="pmid15354252">{{cite journal |author=Ziegler UE |title=[International clinical recommendations on scar management] |language=German |journal=Zentralbl Chir |volume=129 |issue=4 |pages=296–306 |year=2004 |pmid=15354252 |doi=10.1055/s-2004-822830}}</ref> are used to speed healing and reduce the appearance of scars, and likely work in a similar manner as silicone scar sheets. 

[[Pressure dressing]]s are commonly used in managing burn and hypertrophic scars, although supporting evidence is lacking.<ref name=Shih2007>{{cite journal |author=Shih R, Waltzman J, Evans GR |title=Review of over-the-counter topical scar treatment products |journal=Plast.

They are believed to work by applying constant pressure to surface blood vessels, and eventually causing scars to flatten and become softer.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Retrospective and ultrasonic studies since the 1960s have supported their use, but the only randomized clinical trial found no statistically significant difference in wound healing.<ref name=Shih2007/> Care providers commonly report improvements, however, and pressure therapy has been effective in treating ear keloids.<ref name=Shih2007/> The general acceptance of the treatment as effective may prevent it from being further studied in clinical trials.<ref name=Shih2007/>

=== Steroids ===
Under medical supervision, a long-term course of [[corticosteroid]] injections into the scar may help flatten and soften the appearance of keloid or hypertrophic scars.<ref>{{cite pmid|18611924}}</ref>

The steroid is injected into the scar itself; since very little is absorbed into the blood stream, side effects of this treatment are minor. However, it does cause thinning of the scar tissue so it does carry risks when injected into scars caused by operations into ruptured tendons. This treatment is repeated at four- to six-week intervals.

Topical steroids are ineffective.<ref name="ReferenceB">Jenkins M, Alexander JW, MacMillan BG, Waymack JP, Kopcha R. Failure of topical steroids and vitamin E to reduce postoperative scar formation following reconstructive surgery. J Burn Care Rehabil. 1986 Jul–Aug;7(4):309–312.</ref>

=== Surgery ===

Scar revision is a process of cutting the scar tissue out. After the excision, the new wound is usually closed up to heal by [[primary intention]], instead of [[secondary intention]]. Deeper cuts need a multilayered closure to heal optimally, otherwise depressed or dented scars can result.<ref name=scarrevision2010>{{Cite web

Surgical excision of hypertrophic or keloid scars is often associated to other methods, such as pressotherapy or silicone gel sheeting. Lone excision of keloid scars, however, shows a recurrence rate close to 45%. A clinical study is currently ongoing to assess the benefits of a treatment combining surgery and laser-assisted healing in hypertrophic or keloid scars.

===Vitamins===
Research shows the use of [[vitamin E]] and onion extract (sold as [[Mederma]]) as treatments for scars is ineffective.<ref name=Shih2007/> Vitamin E causes contact [[dermatitis]] in up to 33% of users and in some cases it may worsen scar appearance.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> But Vitamin C and some of its esters fade the dark pigment associated with some scars.<ref name="ReferenceA">Farris PK.

== Intentional scarring ==
{{main|Scarification}}
The permanence of scarring has led to its intentional use as a form of [[body art]] within some cultures and subcultures . These forms of  ritual and non-ritual scarring practices can be found in many groups and cultures around the world.

==Research==

An intradermal injection of transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGFβ3) is being tested. The results of three trials already completed were published in the ''Lancet'' along with an editorial commentary.<ref>Renovo. [http://www.renovo.com/en/news/lancet-publication]. Lancet trials in: 11 April 2009 (vol. 373, pages 1264-1274). Lancet commentary by Edward Tredget in: vol 373, pages 1226-1228</ref>

A study implicated the protein [[ribosomal s6 kinase]] (RSK) in the formation of scar tissue and found the introduction of a chemical to counteract RSK could halt the formation of [[cirrhosis]].  This treatment also has the potential to reduce or even prevent altogether other types of scarring.<ref>{{cite news |title=Liver damage 'could be reversed' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7152415.stm |date=27 December 2007 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2008-01-01}}</ref>

Research has also implicated [[osteopontin]] in scarring.<ref>[http://jem.rupress.org/cgi/content/abstract/205/1/43 'Molecular mechanisms linking wound inflammation and fibrosis: knockdown of osteopontin leads to rapid repair and reduced scarring']</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7199897.stm | work=BBC News | title=Gel 'to speed up wound healing' | date=2008-01-22 | accessdate=2010-05-23}}</ref>
