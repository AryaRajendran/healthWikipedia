'''Fecal occult blood''' (FOB) refers to [[blood]] in the [[feces]] that is not visibly apparent. A '''fecal occult blood test''' (FOBT) checks for hidden (occult) [[blood]] in the stool ([[feces]]).<ref>Occult Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Detection, Interpretation, and Evaluation. Beg M et al. JIACM 2002; 3(2):153–158. Full text PDF accessioned 2010/10/26 http://medind.nic.in/jac/t02/i2/jact02i2p153.pdf</ref> Newer tests look for [[globin]], [[DNA]], or other blood factors including [[transferrin]], while conventional [[stool guaiac test]]s look for [[heme]].

==Purpose==
Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), as its name implies, aims to detect subtle blood loss in the [[gastrointestinal tract]], anywhere from the [[mouth]] to the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]. Positive tests ("positive stool") may result from either [[upper gastrointestinal bleeding]] or [[lower gastrointestinal bleeding]] and warrant further investigation for [[peptic ulcer]]s or a [[malignancy]] (such as [[colorectal cancer]] or [[gastric cancer]]). The test does not directly detect colon cancer but is often used in clinical [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] for that disease, but it can also be used to look for active occult blood loss in anemia<ref name="pmid11060470">{{cite journal |author=Harewood GC, Ahlquist DA |title=Fecal occult blood testing for iron deficiency: a reappraisal |journal=Dig Dis |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=75–82 |year=2000 |pmid=11060470 |doi= 10.1159/000016968|url=}}</ref> or when there are gastrointestinal symptoms.<ref name="pmid10672835">{{cite journal |author=Bardhan PK, Beltinger J, Beltinger RW, Hossain A, Mahalanabis D, Gyr K |title=Screening of patients with acute infectious diarrhoea: evaluation of clinical features, faecal microscopy, and faecal occult blood testing |journal=Scand.

==Nomenclature==
In 2007 the nomenclature of overt, obscure and occult bleeding was clarified.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The different methods of testing for "fecal occult blood" as broadly considered actually test for particular components of blood or for aberrantly expressed cellular markers from the intestinal [[mucosa]].

==Methodology==

There are four methods in clinical use for testing for occult [[blood]] in [[feces]].  These look at different properties, such as [[antibody|antibodies]], [[heme]], [[globin]], or [[porphyrin]]s in blood, or at [[DNA]] from cellular material such as from lesions of the intestinal mucosa.

* '''Fecal Immunochemical Testing''' ('''FIT'''), and '''immunochemical fecal occult blood test''' ('''iFOBT'''). FIT products utilize specific [[antibody|antibodies]] to detect [[globin]].  FIT screening is more effective in terms of health outcomes and cost compared with guaiac FOBT.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.gastrohep.2009.01.179}}</ref>  According to the guidelines of the American College of Gastroenterology, "Annual fecal immunochemical testing is the preferred colorectal cancer detection test."<ref name="patients.gi.org">Colorectal Cancer http://patients.gi.org/topics/colorectal-cancer</ref>  The FIT tests are clearly superior to traditional low sensitivity gFOBT for colorectal cancer screening.

* '''[[Stool guaiac test]]''' for fecal occult blood ('''gFOBT'''): – The [[stool guaiac test]] involves smearing some feces on to some absorbent paper that has been treated with a chemical. [[Hydrogen peroxide]] is then dropped on to the paper; if trace amounts of [[blood]] are present, the paper will change color in one or two seconds. This method works as the [[heme]] component in [[hemoglobin]] has a [[peroxidase]]-like effect, rapidly breaking down hydrogen peroxide. In some settings such as gastric or proximal upper intestinal bleeding the guaiac method may be more sensitive than tests detecting globin because globin is broken down in the upper intestine to a greater extent than is heme.<ref>Rockey DC. Occult gastrointestinal bleeding. N Eng J Med 1999; 341 (1): 38–46.</ref> There are various commercially available gFOBT tests which have been categorized as being of low or high sensitivity, and only high sensitivity tests are now recommended in colon cancer screening. Optimal clinical performance of the [[stool guaiac test]] depends on preparatory dietary adjustment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/diagnostic-tests/fecal-occult-blood-test.htm |title=Diagnostic Tests — Fecal Occult Blood Test |accessdate=2007-07-18 |work=}}</ref>

* '''Fecal [[porphyrin]] quantification''': – '''HemoQuant''', unlike gFOBT and FIT, permits precise quantification of hemoglobin, and is [[Verification and validation|analytically validated]] with gastric juice and urine, as well as stool samples.  The heme [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] of intact hemoglobin is [[Redox|chemically converted]] by oxalic acid and ferrous oxalate or ferrous sulfate to [[protoporphyrin]], and the porphyrin content of both the original sample and of the sample after hemoglobin conversion to porphyrin is quantified by comparative fluorescence against a [[reference standard]]; the specificity for hemoglobin is increased by subtracting the fluorescence of a sample blank prepared with citric acid to correct for the potential confounding effect of existing non-specific substances.<ref>United States Patent 4,378,971 Method and apparatus for quantitatively determining the level of hemoglobin in a biological sample. 1983 April 5, accessioned 2010 November 3 as full PDF at http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4378971.pdf</ref>  Precise quantification measurement has been very useful in many clinical research applications.<ref name="pmid6640900">{{cite journal |author=Schwartz S, Dahl J, Ellefson M, Ahlquist D |title=The "HemoQuant" test: a specific and quantitative determination of heme (hemoglobin) in feces and other materials |journal=Clin.

== Test performance ==

=== Reference standards ===

The estimates for test performance characteristics are based on comparison with a variety of [[reference standard|reference methods]] including 51-chromium studies{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, analytical recovery studies in spiked stool samples, analytical recovery after ingestion of autologous blood, rarer studies of carefully quantified blood instilled at bowel surgery {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} as well as other research approaches.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Additionally, clinical studies look at variety of additional factors.

=== Gastrointestinal blood loss in health ===

In healthy people about 0.5 to 1.5 ml of blood escapes blood vessels into the stool each day.<ref>Ahlquist DA, McGill DB, Schwartz S et al. Fecal blood levels in health and disease: a study using HemoQuant. N Eng J Med 1985; 312: 1422–8.</ref><ref>Dybdahl JH, Daae LN, Larsen S. Occult fecal blood loss determined by chemical tests and a 51 Cr method. Scand J Gastroenterol 1981; 16: 245–52.</ref><ref>St. John DJ, Young GP. Evaluation of radiochromium blood loss studies in unexplained iron deficiency anemia.

Observations on the oral administration of citrate blood in man. Am J Med Sci 1942;203:409.</ref> 100 ml in the duodenum, and lesser amounts in the lower intestine. Tests for occult blood identify lesser blood loss.

=== Clinical sensitivity and specificity ===

'''[[Stool guaiac test]]''' for fecal occult blood ('''gFOBT''') sensitivity varies depending on the site of bleeding. Moderately sensitive gFOBT can pick up a daily blood loss of about 10 ml (about two teaspoonfuls), and higher sensitivity gFOBT can pick up lesser amounts, sometimes becoming positive at about 2 ml. The sensitivity of a single stool guaiac test to pick up bleeding has been quoted at 10 to 30%, but if a standard three tests are done as recommended the sensitivity rises to 92%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uptodate.com/ |title=Screening average risk patients for colorectal cancer – B01 |accessdate=2007-10-25 |format= |work=}}</ref> Further discussion of sensitivity and specificity issues that relate particularly to the guaiac method is found in the [[stool guaiac test]] article.

'''Fecal Immunochemical Testing''' ('''FIT''') picks up as little as 0.3 ml but because it does not detect occult blood from the stomach and upper small intestine the test threshold doesn't cause undue false positives from normal upper intestinal blood leakage and it is much more specific for bleeding from the colon or lower gastrointestinal tract.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wdxcyber.com/ncanc10.htm |title=What Does a Positive Fecal Occult Blood Test Mean? – B01 |accessdate=2007-07-18 |work=}}</ref> The detection rate of the test decreases if the time from sample collection to laboratory processing is delayed.<ref name="pmid19408302">{{cite journal |author=van Rossum LG |title=False negative fecal occult blood tests due to delayed sample return in colorectal cancer screening |journal=Int.

'''Fecal [[porphyrin]] quantification''' by '''HemoQuant''' can be [[Type I and type II errors|false positive]] due to exogenous blood and various porphyrins.

== Clinical application ==

The stool guaiac test for hidden (occult) blood in the stool can be done at home or in the doctor's office, or can be performed on samples submitted to a clinical laboratory. Testing kits are available at pharmacies in some countries without a prescription, or a health professional may order a testing kit for use at home. If a home fecal occult blood test detects blood in the stool it is recommended to see a health professional to arrange further testing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/colorectal-cancer/Fecal-Occult-Blood-Test-FOBT |title=Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) |accessdate=2007-07-18 |format= |work=}}</ref>

=== Sources of gastrointestinal bleeding ===
[[Gastrointestinal bleeding]] has many potential sources, and positive results usually result in further testing for the bleeding site, usually looking for [[lower gastrointestinal bleeding]] before [[upper gastrointestinal bleeding]] causes unless there are other clinical clues.<ref name="pmid16303578">{{cite journal |author=Rockey DC |title=Occult gastrointestinal bleeding |journal=Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=699–718 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16303578 |doi=10.1016/j.gtc.2005.08.010 |url=}}</ref>  Colonoscopy is usually preferred to computerized tomographic colonography.<ref name="pmid18054752">{{cite journal |author=Walleser S, Griffiths A, Lord SJ, Howard K, Solomon MJ, Gebski V |title=What is the value of computerized tomographic colonography in patients screening positive for fecal occult blood?

An estimated 1–5% of large tested populations have a positive fecal occult blood test.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  Of those, about 2–10% have cancer, while 20–30% have [[adenoma]]s.

A positive test can result from [[upper gastrointestinal bleeding]] or [[lower gastrointestinal bleeding]].  The common causes are:
* 2–10%: [[cancer]] ([[colorectal cancer]], [[gastric cancer]])
* 20–30% adenoma or [[Polyp (medicine)|polyp]]s
* Bleeding [[peptic ulcer]]
* [[Angiodysplasia]] of the colon
* [[Sickle cell anemia]]

In the event of a positive fecal occult blood test, the next step in the workup is a form of visualization of the gastrointestinal tract by one of several means:
#[[Sigmoidoscopy]], an examination of the rectum and lower colon with a lighted instrument to look for abnormalities, such as polyps.
#[[Colonoscopy]], a more thorough examination of the rectum and entire colon.
#[[Virtual colonoscopy]]
#[[Endoscopy]] refers to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.  It is sometimes performed with chromoendoscopy, a method that assists the endoscopist by enhancing the visual difference between cancerous and normal tissue, either by marking the abnormally increased DNA content (toluidine blue) or failing to stain the tumor, possibly due to decreased surface glycogen on tumor cells(Lugol).<ref>Endo M, Sakakibara N, Suzuki H.

Endoscopy. 1986, 18:11–8.</ref> Infrared fluorescent endoscopy{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and ultrasonic endoscopy{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} can interrogate vascular abnormalities such as esophageal varices.
#Double contrast [[barium enema]]: a series of x-rays of the colon and rectum.

=== Stool color ===

Although red or black stools can be an indication of bleeding, a dark or black color can be due to black licorice, blueberries, iron supplements, lead, Pepto-bismol, and a red color can come from natural or artificial coloring such as red gelatin, popsicles, Kool-Aid, and large amounts of beets.

=== Colorectal cancer screening ===
[[Screening (medicine)|Screening]] methods for colon cancer depend on detecting either precancerous changes such as certain kinds of polyps or on finding early and thus more treatable cancer.  The extent to which screening procedures reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal cancer or mortality depends on the rate of precancerous and cancerous disease in that population. gFOBT and flexible sigmoidoscopy screening have each shown benefit in [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized clinical trials.]] [[Evidence-based medicine|Evidence]] for other colon cancer screening tools such as iFOBT or colonoscopy is substantial and guidelines have been issued by several advisory groups but does not include randomized studies.

Guaiac FOB testing of average risk populations may reduce the mortality associated with [[Colorectal cancer|colon cancer]] by about 25%.<ref name="pmid21058518">{{cite journal |author=Bretthauer M |title=Evidence for colorectal cancer screening |journal=Best Pract Res Clin Anaesthesiol |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=417–25 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=21058518 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  It is not always cost effective to screen a large population.<ref>Mandel JS, Bond JH, Church TR et al.

Scand J Gastroenterol 1994; 29: 468–73.</ref> 

If colon cancer is suspected in an individual (such as in someone with an unexplained [[anemia]]) fecal occult blood tests may not be clinically helpful. If a doctor suspects colon cancer, more rigorous investigation is necessary, whether or not the test is positive.

The 2009 recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG)<ref>Rex DK et al. Am J Gastroenterol. 2009;104:739–750.</ref> suggest that colon cancer screening modalities that are also directly preventive by removing precursor lesions should be given precedence, and prefer a colonoscopy every 10 years in average-risk individuals, beginning at age 50. The ACG suggests that cancer detection tests such as any type of FOB are an alternative that is less preferred and which should be offered to patients who decline colonoscopy or another cancer prevention test.  However, two other recent guidelines, from the US Multisociety Task Force (MSTF)<ref>Levin B et al. Screening and Surveillance for the Early Detection of Colorectal Cancer and Adenomatous Polyps, 2008: A Joint Guideline From the American Cancer Society, the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, and the American College of Radiology. published in two journals – CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians 2008; 58: 130–160 and Gastroenterology 2008; 134: 1570–1595 and available as full text at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/CA.2007.0018/full accessioned 2010 October 26 and as PDF at http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0016-5085/PIIS0016508508002321.pdf accessioned 2010 October 26</ref> and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)<ref>USPSTF Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

The ACG and MSTF also included CT colonography every 5 years, and fecal DNA testing as considerations. All three recommendation panels recommended replacing any older low-sensitivity, guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT) with either newer high-sensitivity guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT) or fecal immunochemical testing (FIT). MSTF looked at 6 studies that compared high sensitivity gFOBT (Hemoccult SENSA) to FIT, and  concluded that there were no clear difference in overall performance between these methods.

In colon cancer screening, using only one sample of feces collected by a doctor performing a digital rectal examination is strongly discouraged.<ref name="pmid15657155">{{cite journal |author=Collins JF, Lieberman DA, Durbin TE, Weiss DG |title=Accuracy of screening for fecal occult blood on a single stool sample obtained by digital rectal examination: a comparison with recommended sampling practice |journal=Ann.

=== Iron deficiency anemia ===
An extensive literature has examined the clinical value of FOBT in iron deficiency anemia.

=== Gastrointestinal disease and medications ===
Conditions such as ulcerative colitis or certain types of relapsing infectious diarrhea can vary in severity over time, and FOBT may assist in assessing the severity of the disease. Medications associated with gastrointestinal bleeding such as Bortezomib are sometimes monitored by FOBT.

=== Alcoholism ===
Several aspects of FOBT in alcoholism warrant further discussion.

=== Outpatient clinics ===
Several studies have reported clinical benefit from gFOBT testing including urology and gynecology clinics.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

=== Inpatient guaiac testing ===
Several studies have questioned the traditional Admission Screening Guaiac (ASG). {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The utility of following stool guaiac in ICU settings is also questioned. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

=== Testing of upper gastrointestinal or aerodigestive tract secretions for occult blood   ===
The use of tests for occult blood in disorders of the mouth, nasal passages, esophagus, lungs and stomach, while analogous to fecal testing, is often discouraged, due to technical considerations including poorly characterized test performance characteristics such as sensitivity, specificity, and analytical interference. However, chemical confirmation that coloration is due to blood rather than coffee, beets, medications, or food additives can be of significant clinical assistance.

A related concept to colon cancer screening by FOBT, based on most neoplasms affecting the surface epithelium and losing small amounts of blood but no visible blood loss, is screening in populations at high risk for esophageal or gastric cancers by testing for blood by swallowing a small capsule that is recovered after 3 to 5 minutes by gentle retrieval by means of an attached nylon thread.<ref name="pmid8416718">{{cite journal |author=Qin DX |title=Screening of esophageal and gastric cancer by occult blood bead detector |journal=Cancer |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=216–8 |year=1993 |month=January |pmid=8416718 |doi= 10.1002/1097-0142(19930101)71:1<216::AID-CNCR2820710133>3.0.CO;2-#|url= |author-separator=, |author2=Wang GQ |author3=Zuo JH |display-authors=3 |last4=Zhang |first4=XH |last5=Yuan |first5=FL |last6=Li |first6=MS |last7=Wu |first7=CR |last8=Ju |first8=CL}}</ref>
