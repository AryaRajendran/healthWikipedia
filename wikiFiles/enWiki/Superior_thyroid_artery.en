The '''superior thyroid artery''' arises from the [[external carotid artery]] just below the level of the greater cornu of the [[hyoid bone]] and ends in the [[thyroid gland]].
 
==Relations==
From its origin under the anterior border of the [[Sternocleidomastoideus]] it runs upward and forward for a short distance in the [[carotid triangle]], where it is covered by the skin, [[Platysma]], and fascia; it then arches downward beneath the [[Omohyoideus]], [[Sternohyoideus]], and [[Sternothyreoideus]]. 

To its medial side are the [[Constrictor pharyngis inferior]] and the external branch of the [[superior laryngeal nerve]].
 
==Branches==
It distributes twigs to the adjacent muscles, and numerous branches to the thyroid gland, anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the [[inferior thyroid arteries]]. 

The [[Glandular branches of the superior thyroid artery|branches to the gland]] are generally two in number; 

Besides the arteries distributed to the muscles and to the thyroid gland, the branches of the superior thyroid are:<ref>{{MedicalMnemonics|136|||}}</ref>

*  [[Hyoid (infrahyoid) artery]]
*  [[Sternocleidomastoid artery]]
*  [[Superior laryngeal artery]] 
*  [[Cricothyroid artery]]

==Surgery==
This artery must be ligated at the thyroid when conducting a [[thyroidectomy]].  If the artery is severed, but not ligated, it will bleed profusely.  In order to gain control of the bleeding the [[surgeon]] may need to extend the original incision laterally to gain access to its origin from the [[external carotid artery]] and ligate it there.

A surgeon tells a medical student to [[Chvostek sign | tap the side of the face]] of a patient who just had thyroid surgery.  The surgeon is most worried about damage to which of the following vessels?  Answer: Superior and inferior thyroid arteries. <ref>Kaplan Qbook - USMLE Step 1 - 5th edition - page 55</ref> Why?  These vessels also supply the parathyroid glands.  If disrupted during surgery, necrosis of the parathyroids occurs, with subsequent hypocalcaemia and tetany.  The masseter is a good muscle to test for tetany.
