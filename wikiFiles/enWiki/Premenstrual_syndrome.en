'''Premenstrual syndrome ''' ('''PMS''') is a collection of [[emotion]]al symptoms, with or without physical [[symptom]]s, related to a woman's [[menstrual cycle]]. While most women of child-bearing age (up to 85%) report having experienced physical symptoms related to normal ovulatory function, such as [[bloating]] or [[breast tenderness]], medical definitions of PMS are limited to a consistent pattern of emotional and physical symptoms occurring only during the [[luteal phase]] of the menstrual cycle that are of "sufficient severity to interfere with some aspects of life".<ref name="ACOG"/> In particular, emotional symptoms must be present consistently to diagnose PMS. The specific emotional and physical symptoms attributable to PMS vary from woman to woman, but each individual woman's pattern of symptoms is predictable, occurs consistently during the ten days prior to menses, and vanishes either shortly before or shortly after the start of menstrual flow.

Two to ten percent of women have significant premenstrual symptoms that are separate from the normal discomfort associated with menstruation in healthy women.<ref name="ACOG" /><ref name="AutoXJ-1"/>

Culturally, the abbreviation PMS is widely understood in English-speaking countries to refer to difficulties associated with menses, and the abbreviation is used frequently even in casual and colloquial settings, without regard to medical rigor.  In these contexts, the syndrome is rarely referred to without abbreviation, and the connotations of the reference are frequently more broad than the clinical definition.

[[Premenstrual dysphoric disorder]] (PMDD) consists of symptoms are similar to, but more severe than, PMS, and while primarily mood-related, may include physical symptoms such as bloating.  [[PMDD]] is classified as a repeating transitory cyclic disorder with similarities to [[unipolar depression]], and several [[antidepressants]] are approved as therapy.<ref name="AutoXJ-2"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Depression-loss of loved one.jpg|thumb|upright|A woman experiencing PMS symptoms may feel unusually irritable, stressed, or sad.]]
More than 200 different symptoms have been associated with PMS, but the three most prominent symptoms are [[irritability]], [[Stress (biological)|tension]], and [[dysphoria]] (unhappiness).<ref name="ACOG"/>  Common emotional and [[non-specific symptom]]s include [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], [[anxiety]], difficulty in falling asleep ([[insomnia]]), [[headache]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], mood swings, increased emotional sensitivity, and changes in libido.<ref name="Merck"/>  Formal definitions absolutely require the presence of emotional symptoms as the [[chief complaint]]; the presence of exclusively physical symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle, such as [[bloating]], abdominal [[cramp]]s, [[constipation]], swelling or tenderness in the breasts, cyclic [[acne]], and joint or muscle pain—no matter how disruptive these physical symptoms are—is ''not'' considered PMS.<ref name="health.am"/>

The exact symptoms and their intensity vary significantly from woman to woman, and even somewhat from cycle to cycle. Most women with premenstrual syndrome experience only a few of the possible symptoms, in a relatively predictable pattern.<ref name="Mayo"/>  For example, one woman with PMS may be anxious and tense for three or four days before her menstrual period begins, and this will happen with only small variations each cycle, such as being somewhat more tense (or less tense) than in previous cycles.

Women with PMS do not experience completely different symptoms each cycle, such as anxiety with one cycle, depression the next, anger in the following cycle, and so forth.  Each woman with PMS has her own personal pattern of symptoms.<ref name="Mayo"/>  While one woman might be anxious and tense, another woman might experience PMS as causing her to be depressed and tearful for two days each cycle, and another woman might find that she is easily irritated by problems that she normally considers minor.  Each woman's pattern, although different from what other women with PMS experience, will be relatively predictable and stable for the woman who experiences it.

Under typical definitions, symptoms must be present at some point during the ten days immediately before the onset of menses, and must not be present for at least one week between the onset of menses and ovulation.<ref name="health.am"/>  Although the intensity of symptoms may vary somewhat, most definitions require that the woman's unique combination of symptoms be present in multiple, consecutive cycles.<ref name=health.am />

==Risk factors==
* High caffeine intake<ref name="health.am" />
* Stress may precipitate condition
* Increasing age
* History of [[Depression (mood)|depression]]
* Family history
* Dietary factors<ref name="Harvard"/> (Low levels of certain vitamins and minerals, particularly [[magnesium]], [[manganese]], [[zinc]],<ref>Chuong CJ, Dawson EB.(1994): Zinc and copper levels in premenstrual syndrome. ''Fertil Steril'' 62(2):313-20. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8034078 </ref> [[vitamin E]] and also [[Vitamin D]])

There may be a genetic aspect to the probability of having premenstrual syndrome: it has been shown that the likelihood of both identical twins suffering from PMS is higher than with fraternal twins.<ref name="ACOG"/> This means that if one twin has PMS, then the other twin is more likely than average to have PMS, pointing to a genetic component. 

[[B vitamins]], in particular [[vitamin B6]], can also assist with PMS.<ref name="B6"/>

==Diagnosis==
There is no laboratory test or unique physical findings to verify the diagnosis of PMS.  The three key features are:<ref name="ACOG"/>

* The woman's chief complaint is one or more of the emotional symptoms associated with PMS (most typically irritability, tension, or unhappiness).
* Symptoms appear predictably during the luteal (premenstrual) phase, reduce or disappear predictably shortly before or during menstruation, and remain absent during the [[follicular phase|follicular]] (pre-ovulatory) phase of the menstrual cycle.
* The symptoms must be severe enough to disrupt or interfere with the woman's everyday life.

To establish a pattern, a woman's physician may ask her to keep a prospective record of her symptoms on a calendar for at least two menstrual cycles.<ref name="Mayo"/> This will help to establish if the symptoms are, indeed, limited to the premenstrual time and are predictably recurring.  A number of standardized instruments have been developed to describe PMS, including the ''Calendar of Premenstrual syndrome Experiences (COPE)'', the ''Prospective Record of the Impact and Severity of Menstruation (PRISM)'', and the ''Visual Analogue Scales (VAS)''.<ref name="ACOG"/>

In addition, other conditions that may better explain symptoms must be excluded.<ref name="ACOG"/>  A number of medical conditions are subject to exacerbation at menstruation, a process called ''menstrual magnification.'' These conditions may lead the patient to believe that she has PMS, when the underlying disorder may be some other problem, such as [[anemia]], [[hypothyroidism]], [[eating disorder]]s and [[substance abuse]].<ref name="ACOG"/>  A key feature is that these conditions may also be present outside of the luteal phase. Conditions that can be magnified perimenstrually include [[Clinical depression|depression]] or other [[affective disorder]]s, [[migraine]], [[seizure disorder]]s, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[irritable bowel syndrome]], [[asthma]], and allergies.<ref name="ACOG"/>  Also, problems with other aspects of the female reproductive system must be excluded, including [[dysmenorrhea]] (pain during menses, rather than before it), [[endometriosis]], [[perimenopause]], and adverse effects produced by [[oral contraceptive pill]]s.<ref name="ACOG"/>

Although there is no universal agreement about what qualifies as PMS, two definitions are commonly used in research programs:

* The National Institute of Mental Health research compares the intensity of symptoms from cycle days 5 to 10 to the six-day interval before the onset of menses.<ref name="ACOG"/>  To qualify as PMS, symptom intensity must increase at least 30% in the six days before menstruation.  Additionally, this pattern must be documented for at least two consecutive cycles.
* The definition formulated at the University of California at San Diego requires both [[affective]] (emotional) and [[somatic]] (physical) symptoms during the five days before menses in each of three consecutive cycles, and must not be present during the pre-ovulatory part of the cycle (days 4 through 13).<ref name="ACOG"/>  For this definition, affective symptoms include symptoms like depression, angry outbursts, irritability, anxiety, confusion, and social withdrawal.  Somatic symptoms include symptoms like breast tenderness, abdominal bloating, headache, and swelling of hands and feet.

==Cause==
The exact causes of PMS are not fully understood. While PMS is linked to the [[luteal phase]], measurements of [[sex hormone]] levels are within normal levels. In [[twin study|twin studies]], the [[concordance (genetics)|concordance]] of PMS is twice as high in monozygotic twins as in dizygotic twins, suggesting the possibility of some genetic component.<ref name="ACOG"/><ref name="AutoXJ-3"/> Current thinking suspects that central-nervous-system neurotransmitter interactions with sex hormones are affected.<ref name="ACOG"/> It is thought to be linked to activity of [[serotonin]] (a neurotransmitter) in the brain.<ref name="Merck"/><ref name="AutoXJ-4"/><ref name="AutoXJ-5"/> Recent studies in rats indicate that levels of glutamate, an excitory neurotransmitter, spikes prior to menstration in the cortex and hippocampus. <ref name="Sun"/> High glutamate levels have been tied to mood disorders in several studies. <ref name="Machado"/>

Preliminary studies suggest that up to 40% of women with symptoms of PMS have a significant decline in their circulating serum levels of beta-endorphin. Beta endorphin is a naturally occurring opioid neurotransmitter which has an affinity for the same receptor that is accessed by heroin and other opiates. Some researchers have noted similarities in symptom presentation between PMS symptoms and opiate withdrawal symptoms.<ref name="AutoXJ-6"/>

In one study of 71 women with PMS, elevated levels of serum [[pseudocholinesterase]] were found. This enzyme is considered a possible marker for trait-anxiety.<ref name="AutoXJ-7"/>

A variety of evolutionary rationales for the syndrome have been offered, including that it is an [[epiphenomenon]] due to the selective advantage accruing to other phases of the hormonal cycle,<ref name="AutoXJ-8"/> that it leads to "intensification of male [[Passion (emotion)|ardour]] during the next onset of fertility",<ref name="AutoXJ-9"/> and that it prompts females to reject infertile males (who cause PMS due to not impregnating the female). "''... an infertile male/potentially fertile female partnership would tend to break down, thus allowing a new pair-bond to be formed. The greater the degree of premenstrual hostility of the female, the sooner a fertile mating could ensue.''"<ref name="AutoXJ-10"/> Any theory would have to account for the persistence of PMS over substantial evolutionary time, as it appears to afflict baboons as well.<ref name="AutoXJ-11"/>

Many researchers have also put forth the theory that PMS is caused primarily by cultural factors.<ref name="AutoXJ-12"/><ref name="pmid1496412"/><ref name="AutoXJ-13"/>

==Management==
Many treatments have been suggested for PMS, including diet or lifestyle changes, and other supportive means. Medical interventions are primarily concerned with hormonal intervention and use of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs).

* Supportive therapy includes evaluation, reassurance, and informational counseling, and is an important part of therapy in an attempt to help the patient regain control over her life. In addition, [[aerobic exercise]] has been found in some studies to be helpful.<ref name="ACOG"/> Some PMS symptoms may be relieved by leading a healthy lifestyle: Reduction of [[caffeine]], [[sugar]], and [[sodium]] intake and increase of [[fiber]], and adequate rest and sleep.<ref name="familydoctor"/>
* Dietary intervention studies indicate that [[Calcium|calcium supplementation]] (1200&nbsp;mg/d) may be useful. Also [[vitamin E]] (400 IU/d) has shown some effectiveness.<ref name="ACOG"/> A number of other treatments have been suggested, although research on these treatments is inconclusive so far: [[Vitamin B6]],<ref name=B6/> [[magnesium]], [[manganese]] and [[tryptophan]].<ref name="familydoctor"/>
* [[SSRI]]s can be used to treat severe PMS.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=J|coauthors=O' Brien, PM; Marjoribanks, J; Wyatt, K|title=Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for premenstrual syndrome|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2009 Apr 15|issue=2|pages=CD001396|pmid=19370564|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001396.pub2|editor1-last=Brown|editor1-first=Julie}}</ref>  Women with PMS may be able to take medication only on the days when symptoms are expected to occur.<ref name="AutoXJ-14"/>  Although intermittent therapy might be more acceptable to some women, this might be less effective than continuous regimens.<ref name="pmid18448752" />
* Hormonal intervention may take many forms:
** [[Hormonal contraception]] is commonly used; common forms include the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] and the [[contraceptive patch]].  This class of medication may cause PMS-related symptoms in some women, and may reduce physical symptoms in other women.<ref name=ACOG />  They do not relieve emotional symptoms.<ref name="ACOG"/>
** [[Progesterone]] support has been used for many years but evidence of its efficacy is inadequate.
** [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist]]s can be useful in severe forms of PMS but have their own set of significant potential side effects.
* Diuretics have been used to handle water retention. [[Spironolactone]] has been shown in some studies to be useful.<ref name="ACOG"/>
* [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs; e.g., ibuprofen) have been used to treat pain.
* [[Clonidine]] has been reported to successfully treat a significant number of women whose PMS symptoms coincide with a steep decline in serum beta-endorphin on a monthly basis.<ref name="AutoXJ-15"/>
* [[Chasteberry]] has been used by women for thousands of years to ease symptoms related to menstrual problems.<ref name="NCCAM"/> It is believed{{by whom|date=April 2013}} some of the compounds found within Chasteberry work on the [[pituitary gland]] to balance hormone levels.
* DL [[phenylalanine]] can reduce or prevent symptoms of PMS in some women. It is only effective when the PMS is associated with an abrupt decline in circulating serum beta-endorphin levels.<ref name="AutoXJ-16"/>
* Recent evidence suggests that daily treatment with [[St. Johns wort]] (Hypericum perforatum) may improve the most common physical and emotional symptoms associated with PMS.<ref name="stjohnswort"/>
* [[Essential fatty acids]],<ref name="AutoXJ-17"/><ref name="AutoXJ-18"/><ref name="AutoXJ-19"/>
* [[Evening primrose oil]], which contains the Omega-6 EFA GLA ([[gamma-Linolenic acid]]), lacks clear scientific support.<ref name="AutoXJ-20"/>

==Prognosis==
PMS is generally a stable diagnosis, with susceptible women experiencing the same symptoms at the same intensity near the end of each cycle for years.<ref name="pmid10584765"/>

Treatment for specific symptoms is usually effective at controlling the symptoms.  Even without treatment, symptoms tend to decrease in perimenopausal women, and disappear at menopause.<ref name="titleLifeWatch - Womens Health - Womens Reproductive Health: PMS"/>

Women who have PMS have an increased risk for [[clinical depression]].

==Epidemiology==
The number of women who experience PMS depends entirely on the stringency of the definition of PMS.<ref name="pmid16796482"/> The World Health Organization estimates that 199&nbsp;million women have premestrual syndrome as of 2010 (5.8% of the female population).<ref name=LancetEpi2012>{{cite journal|last=Vos|first=T|title=Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=2012 Dec 15|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2163–96|pmid=23245607|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61729-2|last2=Flaxman|first2=AD|last3=Naghavi|first3=M|last4=Lozano|first4=R|last5=Michaud|first5=C|last6=Ezzati|first6=M|last7=Shibuya|first7=K|last8=Salomon|first8=JA|last9=Abdalla|first9=S}}</ref> While 80% of menstruating women have experienced at least one symptom that could be attributed to PMS, estimates of prevalence range from as low as 3%<ref name="titleNIH Press Release-Hormones Trigger PMS Symptoms - 01/21/1998"/> to as high as 30%.<ref name="pmid16796482" />

Mood symptoms such as emotional lability are both more consistent and more disabling than somatic symptoms such as bloating.<ref name="pmid9396955"/>  A woman who experiences mood symptoms is likely to experience these symptoms consistently and predictably, whereas physical symptoms may come and go.  Most women find that physical symptoms related to PMS are less disruptive than emotional symptoms

==History==
Many researchers started study the Premenstrual Syndrome of women in 19th century. The first person to name and describe the premenstrual syndrome was Robert T. Frank.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

PMS was originally seen as an imagined disease, with women who reported its symptoms often being told it was "all in their head".<ref name=brennerclinic>{{cite news|last=Lane|first=Darina|title=The Curse of PMS|url=http://www.thebrennerclinic.ie/userfiles/file/PMS%20Darina%201.pdf|accessdate=2012-06-03|newspaper=[[Evening Echo]]|date=2011-07-20|agency=[[Thomas Crosbie Holdings]]|page=11}}</ref>  Interest in PMS began to increase after it was used as a criminal defense in Britain during the early 1980s.<ref name="AutoXJ-21"/>

In order for a condition to be accepted as a [[disease]] by society, many different parts of society must agree on it.  Women have contributed to the rise of interest in PMS and society's acceptance of it as an illness.  It is argued that women are partially responsible for the medicalization of PMS.<ref name="AutoXJ-22"/>  By legitimizing this disorder, women have contributed to the social construction of PMS as an illness.  It has also been suggested that the public debate over PMS and PMDD was impacted by organizations who had a stake in the outcome including feminists, the APA, physicians and scientists.<ref name="AutoXJ-23"/>

The study of PMS symptoms is not a new development.  Debates about the definition and validity of this syndrome have a long history.  As stated above, growing public attention was given to PMS starting in the 1980s.<ref name="AutoXJ-24"/>  Up until this point, there was little research done surrounding PMS and it was not seen as a social problem.  Through clinical trials and the work of feminists, viewing PMS in a social context had begun to take place.

==Alternative views==
Some medical professionals and other people believe that PMS might be a [[socially constructed]] disorder rather than a physical illness.<ref name=pmid1496412/> The anthropologist [[Emily Martin (anthropologist)|Emily Martin]] argues that PMS is a cultural phenomenon that continues to grow in a positive feedback loop. Also, the studies on PMS will either tell women that PMS is detrimental to their work capabilities depending on whether the need for women in the work force is strong (historically during wartime when men were away) or if women are being relegated to home life (when men return from war and once again desire work). <ref name=Martin>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Emily|title=The Woman in the Body|year=1992|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=118}}</ref>  At the time that women were being forced back into the home after WWI, the symptoms of PMS and menstruation were considered more debilitating than during WWII, when it was not a “liability after all.” <ref name=Martin>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Emily|title=The Woman in the Body|year=1992|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=120}}</ref> In general, wartime triggers studies that diminish the impacts of PMS in women's lives, whereas inter-wartime studies promote the idea of PMS being a large, monthly obstacle in women's lives.

In women with PMDD—which supporters of the [[medical model]] of PMS say is a severe form of PMS, and critics say is unrelated—studies have shown a correlation between self-reported emotional distress and levels of a serotonin precursor as measured by [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).<ref name="pmid16515859"/> PMDD also has a consistent treatment record with [[SSRIs]], when compared with placebos.<ref name="pmid10471170"/> The decision to call PMDD an illness has been criticized as inappropriate [[medicalization]].<ref name="AutoXJ-25"/>

Most supporters of PMS as a social construct believe PMDD and PMS to be unrelated issues: according to them, PMDD is a product of brain chemistry, and PMS is a product of a [[hypochondria]]tic culture. Most studies on PMS and PMDD rely solely on self-reporting. According to sociologist [[Carol Tavris]], Western women are socially conditioned to expect PMS or to at least know of its existence, and they therefore report their symptoms accordingly.<ref name="AutoXJ-26"/>

Another view holds that PMS is too frequently or wrongly diagnosed in many cases. A variety of problems, such as chronic depression, infections, and outbursts of frustration can be mis-diagnosed as PMS if they happen to coincide with the premenstrual period.  Tavris says that PMS is blamed as an explanation for rage or sadness.<ref name="AutoXJ-27"/>

The use of multiple [[SSRI]]'s to treat PMS has caused some controversy. The makers of Prozac began marketing the generic form, [[fluoxetine]], under the name Sarafem to treat PMS. This coincided with their loss of patent on Prozac, which has led to one suggestion that their motives are not completely benign.<ref name="AutoXJ-28"/> An oral contraceptive named [[drospirenone]] (Yaz) was approved to treat PMDD. The marketing of Yaz centers on this aspect of the drug.<ref name="AutoXJ-29"/>

Many of the following studying people have different views on the women with Premenstrual Syndrome.  Edward Clarke wrote an influential book, ''Sex in Education'' (1873) saying that women should stay home because of their uncontrollable behaviors when they have Premenstrual Syndrome. Thomas Buckley mentions that in his article too, "a menstruating woman should isolate herself because this is the time when she is at the height of her powers. Thus, the time should not be wasted in mundane tasks and social distractions, nor should one's concentration be broken by concerns with the opposite sex."<ref name="autogenerated1">Martin premenstrual syndrome,work discipline,and anger</ref> Michelle Harrison, after study the premenstrual women, said that "Women who are premenstrual often have a need for time alone, time to themselves, and yet few women actually have that time in their lives. <ref name="autogenerated1"/>
