The '''fasciculus cuneatus''' ('''tract of Burdach''', named for [[Karl Friedrich Burdach]]) is a tract of nerves in the spinal cord that primarily transmits information from the arms. It is part of the [[posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway]].

==Physical characteristics==
The fasciculus cuneatus is triangular on transverse section, and lies between the [[fasciculus gracilis]] and the [[posterior column]], its base corresponding with the surface of the [[medulla spinalis]]. 

Its fibers, larger than those of the fasciculus gracilis, are mostly derived from the same source, viz., the [[posterior nerve roots]]. 

Some ascend for only a short distance in the tract, and, entering the [[gray matter]], come into close relationship with the cells of the [[dorsal nucleus]], while others can be traced as far as the [[medulla oblongata]], where they end in the [[gracile nucleus]] and [[cuneate nucleus]].

==Function==
The Fasciculus cuneatus transmits fine touch, fine pressure, vibration, and [[proprioception]] information from [[spinal nerve]]s located in [[dermatome]]s C<sub>1</sub> through T<sub>6</sub>.

==Neurons==
The Fasciculus cuneatus tract is composed of first-order neurons that synapse onto second-order neurons in the brain stem.  

The second-order neurons [[decussate]] in the [[brainstem]] and continue on to the [[thalamus]] where the second-order neurons synapse onto third-order neurons.  

The third-order neurons carry the received signals to the [[somatosensory cortex]], where the signals, in the form of [[action potential]]s, are interpreted.
