The '''mesolimbic pathway''' is a [[dopaminergic pathway]] in the [[brain]]. The pathway begins in the [[ventral tegmentum|ventral tegmental area]] of the [[mesencephalon|midbrain]] and connects to the [[limbic system]] via the [[nucleus accumbens]], the [[amygdala]],  and the [[hippocampus]] as well as to the [[prefrontal cortex|medial prefrontal cortex]].  The mesolimbic dopamine system is widely believed to be a "reward" pathway, but that hypothesis is not universally accepted.<ref name="Berridge"/> 

==Anatomy==
The following structures are considered to be a part of the mesolimbic pathway:
;Ventral Tegmental Area
:The [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) is a part of the midbrain.  It consists of dopaminergic, [[GABA receptor|GABAergic]], and [[glutamic acid|glutamatergic]] [[neuron]]s.<ref name="Pierce">Pierce RC, Kumaresan V. 2006. The mesolimbic dopamine system: The final common pathway for the reinforcing effect of drugs of abuse? ''Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews'' 30:215-38</ref> The VTA communicates with the nucleus accumbens via the [[medial forebrain bundle]].
;Nucleus Accumbens
:The nucleus accumbens is found in the [[striatum|ventral striatum]] and is composed of [[medium spiny neuron]]s.<ref name="Zhang">Zhang TA, Maldve RE, Morrisett RA. 2006. Coincident signaling in mesolimbic structures underlying alcohol reinforcement. ''[[Biochemical Pharmacology]]'' 72:919-27</ref><ref name="Purves">Purves D et al. 2008. Neuroscience. Sinauer 4ed. 754-56</ref> It is subdivided into limbic and motor  subregions  known as the shell and core.<ref name="Pierce"/> The medium spiny neurons receive input from both the dopaminergic neurons of the VTA and the glutamatergic neurons of the hippocampus, amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex.  When they are activated by these inputs, the medium spiny neurons' projections release GABA onto the [[globus pallidus|ventral pallidum]].<ref name="Pierce"/> The release of dopamine in this structure drives the mesolimbic system.
;Amygdala
:The amygdala is  a large nuclear mass in the [[temporal lobe]] anterior to the hippocampus.  It has been associated with the assignment of emotions, especially fear and anxiety. There are two, one in each temporal lobe, and their functions may be [[lateralization of brain function|lateralized]].
;Hippocampus
:The hippocampus is located in the medial portion of the temporal lobe.  It is known for its association with double memory (''i.e.'', both [[Procedural memory|procedural]] and [[declarative memory]]).
;Bed Nucleus of the [[Stria terminalis|Stria Terminalis]]

==Controversy over mesolimbic dopamine function==
There is some controversy regarding [[dopamine]]’s role in the [[reward system]].  Three hypotheses — hedonia, learning, and incentive salience — have been proposed as explanations for [[dopamine]]’s function in the [[reward system]].<ref name="Berridge">Berridge KC. 2007. The debate over dopamine's role in reward: the case for incentive salience. ''Psychopharmacology'' 191:391-431</ref> The hedonia hypothesis suggests that [[dopamine]] in the [[nucleus accumbens]] acts as a '[[pleasure]] [[neurotransmitter]]'. Historically, in the late 1970s, it was found that some [[drug]]s of abuse involved dopamine activity, particularly in the [[nucleus accumbens]], to cause the "high" or [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoric]] state.  However, not all rewards or pleasurable things involve activation of the reward system, which may suggest that the mesolimbic pathway may not be just a system that works merely off enjoyable things (hedonia).<ref name="Neill"> Neill D. Emory University. ''Personal Interview''. 14 Oct. 2008</ref> Learning, on the other hand, deals with predictions of future rewards and association formation. Studies have shown that rats that had their [[ventral tegmental area]] and [[nucleus accumbens]] destroyed do not lose their learning capabilities, but rather lack the [[motivation]] to work for a reward.<ref name="Berridge"/> [[Incentive salience]] (wanting) stands out as a possible role for [[dopamine]] as it regards this molecule as being released when there is a stimulus worth working hard for, thus making an individual work to get it. This is one of the reasons why [[dopamine]] transport has been extensively studied in the case of [[Attention deficit disorder | ADD]] and [[ADHD]]. It is now widely understood that most people suffering from some form of attention deficit disorder most likely lack dopamine stimulation. This also explains why [[dopamine reuptake inhibitors]] and stimulants often dramatically improve symptoms of attention disorders.  In self-administration studies, animals have been trained to give an [[Operant conditioning|operant response]] (lever press, nose poke, wheel turn, etc.) in order to obtain either a drug or mate. It has been shown that the animals will continue to perform the required task until the reward is received, or fatigue sets in.<ref name="Pierce"/><ref name="Neill"/>

==Clinical significance==
Since the mesolimbic pathway is shown to be associated with feelings of reward and desire, this pathway is heavily implicated in [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] theories of [[Substance dependence|addiction]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[major depressive disorder|depression]].<ref name="Van">Van den Heuval DMA, Pasterkamp RJ. 2008.

Drug addiction, the loss of control over drug use or the compulsive seeking and taking of drugs despite adverse consequences, with  the four major classes of abused drugs (psychostimulants, opiates, ethanol, and nicotine) are due to increased dopamine transmission in the limbic system-each by different mechanisms.<ref name="Pierce"/><ref name="Janhunen">Janhunen S, Ahtee L. 2007.
