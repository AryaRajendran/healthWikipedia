In medicine, '''subclavian steal syndrome''' (SSS), also called '''subclavian steal phenomenon''' or '''subclavian steal steno-occlusive disease''', is a constellation of [[sign (medicine)|signs]] and [[symptom]]s that arise from retrograde (reversed) flow of [[blood]] in the [[vertebral artery]] or the [[internal thoracic artery]], due to a [[proximal]] [[stenosis]] (narrowing) and/or occlusion of the [[subclavian artery]]. The arm may be supplied by blood flowing in a retrograde direction down the vertebral artery at the expense of the vertebrobasilar circulation. This is called the ''subclavian steal''.

== Pathophysiology ==
Classically, SSS is a consequence of a redundancy in the circulation of the brain<ref>{{cite journal | author = Klingelhöfer J, Conrad B, Benecke R, Frank B | title = Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography of carotid-basilar collateral circulation in subclavian steal. | journal = Stroke | volume = 19 | issue = 8 | pages = 1036–42 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3041649 | doi = 10.1161/01.STR.19.8.1036}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Lord R, Adar R, Stein R | title = Contribution of the circle of Willis to the subclavian steal syndrome | journal = Circulation | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 871–8 | year = 1969 | pmid = 5377222}}</ref> and the [[hemodynamics|flow of blood]].

SSS results when the short low resistance path (along the subclavian artery) becomes a high resistance path (due to narrowing) and blood flows around the narrowing via the arteries that supply the brain (left and right vertebral artery, left and right internal carotid artery).  The blood flow from the brain to the [[upper limb]] in SSS is considered to be ''[[steal|stolen]]'' as it is blood flow the brain must do without. This is because of collateral vessels. 

As in vertebral-subclavian steal, [[coronary artery|coronary]]-subclavian steal may occur in patients who have received a [[coronary artery bypass graft]] using the [[internal thoracic artery]] (ITA), also known as internal mammary artery.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Takach T, Reul G, Cooley D, Duncan J, Livesay J, Ott D, Gregoric I | title = Myocardial thievery: the coronary-subclavian steal syndrome | journal = Ann Thorac Surg | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 386–92 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16368420 | doi = 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2005.05.071}}</ref> As a result of this procedure, the distal end of the ITA is diverted to one of the coronary arteries (typically the [[left anterior descending coronary artery|LAD]]), facilitating blood supply to the [[heart]]. In the setting of increased resistance in the proximal subclavian artery, blood may flow backward away from the heart along the ITA causing [[myocardial ischemia]].  Vertebral-subclavian and [[coronary artery|coronary]]-subclavian steal can occur concurrently in patients with an ITA [[coronary artery bypass graft|CABG]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lee S, Jeong M, Rhew J, Ahn Y, Na K, Song H, Bom H, Cho J, Ahn B, Park J, Kim S, Kang J | title = Simultaneous coronary - subclavian and vertebral - subclavian steal syndrome | journal = Circ J | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 464–6 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12736489 | doi = 10.1253/circj.67.464}}</ref>

=== Hemodynamics ===
Blood, like [[electrical current]], flows along the path of least [[fluid resistance|resistance]]. Resistance is affected by the length and width of a vessel (i.e. a long narrow vessel has the greatest resistance and a short fat one the least), but crucially in the human body width is generally more limiting than length because of Poiseuille's Law. Thus, if blood is presented with two paths, a short one that is narrow (with a high overall resistance) and a long one that is wide (with a low overall resistance), it will take the long and wide path (the one with the lower resistance).

=== Vascular anatomy ===
The [[blood vessel]]s supplying the [[brain]] arise from the [[vertebral artery|vertebral arteries]] and [[internal carotid artery|internal carotid arteries]] and are connected to one another by communicating vessels that form a circle (known as the [[Circle of Willis]]).

=== Path of the blood (normal versus SSS) ===
Normally, blood flows from the [[aorta]] into the subclavian artery, and then some of that blood leaves via the vertebral artery to supply the brain.  

In SSS a reduced quantity of blood flows through the proximal subclavian artery.  As a result, blood travels up one of the other blood vessels to the brain (the other vertebral or the carotids), reaches the basilar artery or goes around the cerebral arterial circle and descends via the (ipsilateral) vertebral artery to the subclavian (with the proximal blockage) and feeds blood to the distal subclavian artery (which supplies the upper limb and shoulder).

== Etiology ==
* [[Atherosclerosis]]
* [[Cervical rib]]
* [[Takayasu's arteritis]]

== Signs and symptoms ==
* [[Presyncope]] (sensation that one is about to faint)
* [[Syncope (medicine)|Syncope]] (fainting)
* [[Neurologic]] deficits
* [[Blood pressure]] differential between the arms
* severe memory problems
* hands showing circulation problems (hands can have blotchy patches of red and white) (associated with other stigma to [[vascular disease]] (e.g. vascular insufficiency [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcers]] of the [[foot]]).

== Differential diagnosis ==
* [[Stroke]]
