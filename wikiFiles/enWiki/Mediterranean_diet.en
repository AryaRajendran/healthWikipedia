{{About|the dietary recommendation that became popular in the 1990s|food of the areas around the [[Mediterranean Sea]]|Mediterranean cuisine}}
The '''Mediterranean diet''' is a modern nutritional recommendation inspired by the traditional dietary patterns of southern [[Italy]], [[Greece]], and [[Spain]]<!-- these are the regions which orginally *inspired* it, not the regions where it is found--><ref>Alberto Capatti ''et al.'', ''Italian Cuisine: A Cultural History'', p. 106.;  Silvano Serventi and Francoise Sabban, ''Pasta'', p. 162.</ref><ref>[http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/WBL02211/Eat-Like-a-Greek-to-Avoid-Skin-Cancer.html Eat like a Greek to avoid skin cancer]</ref> The principal aspects of this diet include proportionally high consumption of [[olive oil]], [[legume]]s, [[Whole foods | unrefined cereals]], [[fruit]]s, and [[vegetable]]s, moderate to high consumption of fish, moderate consumption of dairy products (mostly as cheese and yogurt), moderate wine consumption, and low consumption of meat and meat products.<ref>"Get your Meds: the Mediterranean Diet and Health", Ellen Gooch, Epikouria Magazine, Fall 2005</ref>

On November 17, 2010, [[UNESCO]] recognized this diet pattern as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Spain]] and [[Morocco]].<ref>Unesco, [http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00394 The Mediterranean diet]</ref>

Despite its name, this diet is not typical of all [[Mediterranean cuisine]]. In Northern Italy, for instance, [[lard]] and [[butter]] are commonly used in cooking, and olive oil is reserved for dressing salads and cooked vegetables.<ref>Massimo Alberini, Giorgio Mistretta, ''Guida all'Italia gastronomica'', Touring Club Italiano, 1984</ref> In North Africa, wine is traditionally avoided by Muslims. In both [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle East]], sheep's tail fat and rendered butter ([[ghee|''samna'']]) are the traditional staple fats, with some exceptions.<ref>{{cite book |author=Tapper, Richard; Zubaida, Sami |title=A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East |publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks |year=2001 |isbn=1-86064-603-4 |page=43}}</ref>

The most commonly understood version of the Mediterranean diet was presented, amongst others, by Dr [[Walter Willett]] of [[Harvard University]]'s [[Harvard School of Public Health|School of Public Health]] from the mid-1990s on.<ref name="

Olive oil is particularly characteristic of the Mediterranean diet. It contains a very high level of monounsaturated fats, most notably [[oleic acid]], which epidemiological studies suggest may be linked to a reduction in coronary heart disease risk.<ref>Keys, A., Menotti, A., Karvonen, M.J., et al. (December 1986). «The diet and 15-year death rate in the seven countries study,» Am. J. Epidemiol. 124 (6): 903–15.</ref> There is also evidence that the antioxidants in olive oil improve cholesterol regulation and LDL cholesterol reduction, and that it has other anti-inflammatory and anti-hypertensive effects.<ref>Covas, M.I., (March 2007). “Olive oil and the cardiovascular system”.

==History==
Although it was first publicized in 1945 by the [[U.S.A.|American]] doctor [[Ancel Keys]] stationed in [[Salerno]], Italy, the Mediterranean diet failed to gain widespread recognition until the 1990s. Objective data showing that Mediterranean diet is healthy, first originated from the [[Seven Countries Study]].

Mediterranean diet is based on what from the point of view of mainstream [[nutrition]] is considered a paradox: that although the people living in Mediterranean countries tend to consume relatively high amounts of fat, they have far lower rates of [[cardiovascular disease]] than in countries like the [[United States]], where similar levels of fat consumption are found. A parallel phenomenon is known as the [[French Paradox]].<ref name="Paradoxes">Bruno Simini, "Serge Renaud: from French paradox to Cretan miracle" ''The Lancet'' '''355''':9197:48 (1 January 2000) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T1B-4FV5JRM-5J&_user=521319&_coverDate=01%2F01%2F2000&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000026018&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=521319&md5=b36c10828f270bea29b2f203951df232 at Science Direct (subscription)]</ref>

A diet rich in salads was promoted in England during the early [[Renaissance]] period by [[Giacomo Castelvetro]] in ''A Brief Account of the Fruits, Herbs, and Vegetables of Italy''.<ref>Castelvetro. G., ''The Fruits, Herbs, and Vegetables of Italy'', London, Viking, 1989, translated from the original published in 1614.</ref> He attempted, without success, to convince the English to eat more fruits and vegetables.

==Health effects==

A number of diets have received attention, but the strongest evidence for a beneficial health effect and decreased mortality after switching to a largely plant based diet comes from studies of Mediterranean diet, e.g. from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Mediterranean dietary pattern and prediction of all-cause mortality in a US population: results from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study|authors=Mitrou PN, Kipnis V, Thiébaut AC, Reedy J, Subar AF, Wirfält E, Flood A, Mouw T, Hollenbeck AR, Leitzmann MF, Schatzkin A|journal=Arch Intern Med|date=2007-12-10|volume=167|issue=22|pages=2461–8}}</ref>

The Mediterranean diet often is cited as beneficial for being low in [[saturated fat]] and high in [[monounsaturated fat]] and [[dietary fiber]]. One of the main explanations is thought to be the [[Olive oil#Nutrition and health effects|health effects of olive oil]] included in the Mediterranean diet.

The Mediterranean diet is high in salt content.<ref>{{cite journal|author=C. Leclercq and A. Ferro-Luzzi|date=Mar 1991|title=Total and domestic consumption of salt and their determinants in three regions of Italy|journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=45|issue=3|pages=151–9|pmid=2065639}}</ref> Foods such as olives, salt-cured cheeses, anchovies, capers, salted fish roe, and salads dressed with extra virgin olive oil all contain high levels of salt.

The inclusion of red wine is considered a factor contributing to health as it contains [[flavonoid]]s with powerful [[antioxidant]] properties.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baron-Menguy C, Bocquet A, Guihot AL, ''et al.'' |title=Effects of red wine polyphenols on postischemic neovascularization model in rats: low doses are proangiogenic, high doses anti-angiogenic |journal=FASEB J. |volume=21 |issue=13 |pages=3511–21 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17595348 |doi=10.1096/fj.06-7782com }}<br/>[http://www.sciencedaily.com­/releases/2007/10/071030082146.htm "Chemical In Red Wine, Fruits, And Vegetables May Stop Cancer, Heart Disease, Depending On The Dose."] ScienceDaily 1 November 2007.</ref>

Dietary factors are only part of the reason for the health benefits enjoyed by certain Mediterranean cultures. A healthy lifestyle (notably a physically active lifestyle or labour) is also beneficial.<ref>Cardiovascular disease risk factors: epidemiology and risk assessment. Dahlöf B.

However, on the population level, i.e. for the population of a whole country or a region, the influence of [[genetics]] is rather minimal, because it was shown that the slowly changing habits of Mediterranean populations, from a healthy active lifestyle and Mediterranean diet to a not so healthy, less physically active lifestyle and a diet influenced by the [[Western pattern diet]], significantly increases risk of [[heart disease]].<ref>Cardiovascular disease risk factors and dietary habits of farmers from Crete 45 years after the first description of the Mediterranean diet.

The putative benefits of the Mediterranean diet for cardiovascular health are primarily correlative in nature; while they reflect a very real disparity in the geographic incidence of heart disease, identifying the causal determinant of this disparity has proven difficult.  The most popular dietary candidate, olive oil, has been undermined by a body of experimental evidence that diets enriched in monounsaturated fats such as olive oil are not atheroprotective when compared to diets enriched in either polyunsaturated or even saturated fats.<ref name="Monounsaturated fatty acids and atherosclerosis">{{cite journal |author=Brown JM, Shelness GS, Rudel LL |title=Monounsaturated fatty acids and atherosclerosis: opposing views from epidemiology and experimental animal models |journal=Curr Atheroscler Rep |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=494–500 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18377790 |doi=10.1007/s11883-007-0066-8 }}</ref><ref name="Monounsaturated fatty acids promote atherosclerosis">{{cite journal |author=Rudel LL, Kelley K, Sawyer JK, Shah R, Wilson MD |title=Dietary monounsaturated fatty acids promote aortic atherosclerosis in LDL receptor-null, human ApoB100-overexpressing transgenic mice |journal=[[Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol.]] |volume=18 |issue=11 |pages=1818–27 |pmid=9812923 |url=http://atvb.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/18/11/1818 |date= November 1, 1998 }}</ref>
A recently emerging alternative hypothesis to the Mediterranean diet is that differential exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation accounts for the disparity in cardiovascular health between residents of Mediterranean and more northerly countries.  The proposed mechanism is solar UVB-induced synthesis of Vitamin D in the oils of the skin, which has been observed to reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease, and which rapidly diminishes with increasing latitude.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wong A |title=Incident solar radiation and coronary heart disease mortality rates in Europe |journal=Eur J Epidemiol. |volume=23 |issue=9 |pages=609–14 |year=2008 |pmid=18704704 |doi=10.1007/s10654-008-9274-y }}</ref> Interestingly, residents of the Mediterranean are also observed to have very low rates of skin cancer (which is widely believed to be caused by over-exposure to solar UV radiation); incidence of [[melanoma]]s in the Mediterranean countries is lower than in Northern Europe and significantly lower than in other hot countries such as Australia and New Zealand.{{cn|date=September 2012}} Its been hypothesized that some components of the Mediterranean diet may provide protection against skin cancer.

A study published in the ''Archives of General Psychiatry'' shows that people who followed the Mediterranean diet were less likely to develop depression.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sanchez-Villegas|first=A.|coauthors=Delgado-Rodriguez, M., Alonso, A., Schlatter, J., Lahortiga, F., Serra Majem, L., Martinez-Gonzalez, M.

==Medical research==
The [[Seven Countries Study]]<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Coronary heart disease in seven countries |journal=Circulation |volume=41 |issue=4 Suppl |pages=I1–211 |year=1970 |month=April |pmid=5442782 }}</ref> found that Cretan men had exceptionally low death rates from heart disease, despite moderate to high intake of fat.  The [[Cretan diet]] is similar to other traditional Mediterranean diets, consisting mostly of [[olive oil]], bread, abundant fruit and vegetables, fish, and a moderate amount of dairy foods and wine.

The [[Lyon Diet Heart Study]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4655 |title=Lyon Diet Heart Study}}</ref> set out to mimic the Cretan diet, but adopted a pragmatic approach. Realizing that some of the people in the study (all of whom had survived a first heart attack) would be reluctant to move from butter to olive oil, they used a margarine based on [[rapeseed]] ([[canola]]) oil. The dietary change also included 20% increases in vitamin C-rich fruit and bread and decreases in processed and red meat. On this diet, mortality from all causes was reduced by 70%. This study was so successful that the ethics committee decided to stop it prematurely so that the results could be made public immediately.<ref name="refname1">{{cite journal | author=de Lorgeril M, Salen P, Martin JL, Monjaud I, Delaye J, Mamelle N. | title=Mediterranean diet, traditional risk factors, and the rate of cardiovascular complications after myocardial infarction: final report of the Lyon Diet Heart Study | journal=Circulation | year=1999 | volume=99 | issue=6 | pages=779–85 | pmid=9989963}}</ref>

According to a 2008 study published in the ''British Medical Journal'', the traditional Mediterranean diet provides substantial protection against [[type 2 diabetes]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Martínez-González MA, de la Fuente-Arrillaga C, Nunez-Cordoba JM, ''et al.'' |title=Adherence to Mediterranean diet and risk of developing diabetes: prospective cohort study |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7657 |pages=1348–51 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18511765 |pmc=2427084 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39561.501007.BE }}</ref> The study involved over 13 000 graduates from the [[University of Navarra]] in [[Spain]] with no history of diabetes, who were recruited between December 1999 and November 2007, and whose dietary habits and health were subsequently tracked. Participants initially completed a 136-item food frequency questionnaire designed to measure the entire diet. The questionnaire also included questions on the use of fats and oils, cooking methods and dietary supplements. Every two years participants were sent follow-up questionnaires on diet, lifestyle, risk factors, and medical conditions. New cases of diabetes were confirmed through medical reports. During the follow-up period (median 4.4 years) the researchers from the University of Navarra found that participants who stuck closely to the diet had a lower risk of diabetes. A high adherence to the diet was associated with an 83% relative reduction in the risk of developing diabetes.<ref>[http://newswise.com/articles/view/541183/ The Traditional Mediterranean Diet Protects Against Diabetes] Newswise, Retrieved on July 2, 2008.</ref>

A 2008 study published in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' examined the effects of three diets: low-carb, low-fat, and Mediterranean. The study involved 322 participants and lasted for two years. The low-carb and Mediterranean diet resulted in the greatest weight loss, 12&nbsp;lbs and 10&nbsp;lbs, respectively. The low-fat diet resulted in a loss of 7&nbsp;lbs. One caveat of the study is that 86% of the study participants were men. The low-carb and Mediterranean diets produced similar amounts of weight loss in the overall study results and in the men. In the remaining participants who were women, the Mediterranean diet produced 3.8&nbsp;kg (8.4&nbsp;lbs) more weight loss on average than the low-carb diet. However, the low-carb diet produced more favorable changes in blood lipids.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shai I, Schwarzfuchs D, Henkin Y, Shahar DR, Witkow S, Greenberg I, Golan R, Fraser D, Bolotin A, Vardi H, Tangi-Rozental O, Zuk-Ramot R, Sarusi B, Brickner D, Schwartz Z, Sheiner E, Marko R, Katorza E, Thiery J, Fiedler GM, Blüher M, Stumvoll M, Stampfer MJ; Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial (DIRECT) Group. |title=Weight loss with a low-carbohydrate, Mediterranean, or low-fat diet. |journal=N Engl J Med |date=July 17, 2008 |pmid=18635428  |volume=359 |pages=229–241 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0708681 |issue=3}}</ref>

A study published in the ''British Medical Journal'' in 2009 showed some components of the Mediterranean diet, such as high vegetable consumption and low meat and meat product consumption, are more significantly associated with low risk of mortality than other components, such as cereal consumption and fish consumption. As part of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study, researchers followed more than 23,000 Greek men and women for 8.5 years to see how various aspects of a Mediterranean diet affect mortality. Moderate alcohol consumption, high fruit and nut consumption, and high legume consumption were also associated with lower risk of mortality.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/338/jun23_2/b2337?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=mediterranean&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&sortspec=date&resourcetype=HWCIT |title=Anatomy of health effects of Mediterranean diet: Greek EPIC prospective cohort study}}</ref>

A recent randomized Spanish trial of diet pattern published in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] in 2013 followed almost 7,500 individuals over around 5 years found that individuals on a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts and [[olive oil]] had a 30 percent reduction in risk of having a major cardiovascular event and a 49 percent decrease in stoke risk.
