'''Oropharyngeal cancer''' is a disease which [[malignant]] cells form in the tissue of oropharynx. [[Oropharynx]] is a middle part of the throat which includes the base of the tongue, the tonsils, the soft [[palate]], and the walls of the [[pharynx]].<ref name="oropharyngeal cancer overview">{{cite web

==Studies==
For patients with advanced oropharyngeal cancer the combination of [[radiotherapy]] and [[chemotherapy]] appears to be as efficient as surgical management. Shiley ''et al'' compared the maintenance of swallowing function with the two approaches. They studied 27 patients who underwent the advanced stage (III and IV) of oropharyngeal cancer. Among those patients, 67% had base of tongue lesions and 82% of them used [[gastrostomy tube]] either before or during the treatment. Three months after the chemoradiation, 33% of the patients were consuming all nutrition orally, 45% had some oral intake but still had the tube feeding, and 22% had no oral intake at all. The results showed that the short-term incidence of gastrostomy tube dependence after chemo radiation was similar to that after surgical management of oropharyngeal cancer at their institution.<ref name="Swallowing Function">{{cite journal

*A sore throat that persists
*Pain or difficulty with swallowing
*Unexplained weight loss
*Voice changes
*Ear pain
*A lump in the back of the throat or mouth
*A lump in the neck
*A dull pain behind the [[Human sternum|sternum]]
*Cough

==Risk factors==
Following are the risk factors that can increase the risk of developing oropharyngeal cancer. 
<ref name= "treatment" />
*Smoking and chewing tobacco.
*Heavy alcohol use.
*A diet low in fruits and vegetables.
*Chewing betel quid, a stimulant commonly used in parts of Asia.
*Being infected with [[human papilloma virus]] (HPV).
*EBV infection.
*plummer-Vinson syndrome.
*poor nutrition.
*Asbestos exposure.
*P53 mutation.

CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH MALIGNANT TRANSFORMATION

HIGH-risk lesions
* Erythroplakia
* speckled Erythroplakia
* Chronic hyperplastic candidiasis
Medium- risk lesions.
* oral submucosal fibrosis
* syphilitic glossitis
* sideropenic dysphagia (or paterson-kelly-brown syndrome)
low-risk lesions.
* oral lichen planus
* discoid lupus erythematosus
* discoid keratosis congenita.

==Prognosis==
Those with HPV-positive cancers tend to have higher survival rates.<ref name=Nordqvist/>  The [[prognosis]] for people with oropharyngeal cancer depends on the age and health of the person and the stage of the disease. It is important for people with oropharyngeal cancer to have follow-up exams for the rest of their lives as cancer can occur in nearby areas. In addition, it is important to eliminate risk factors such as smoking and drinking alcohol, which increase the risk for second cancers.<ref name="oropharyngeal cancer overview" />

==Spread==
There are three ways of cancer spreading in the body.<ref name="treatment" />
*Cancer invades the surrounding normal [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].
*Cancer invades the [[lymph system]] and travels through the [[lymph vessels]] to other places in the body.
*Cancer invades the [[veins]] and [[capillaries]] and travels through the blood to other places in the body.

==Stages==
<ref name="treatment" />

===Stage 0 carcinoma in situ===
Abnormal cells are found in the lining of the [[oropharynx]], These may become cancer and spread into nearby normal [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]].

===Stage 1===
Cancer has formed and is 20 millimetres or smaller and has not spread outside the [[oropharynx]].

===Stage 2===
Cancer has formed and is larger than 20 millimetres but not larger than 40 millimetres. Also it  has not yet spread outside the [[oropharynx]].

===Stage 3===
*Cancer is larger than 40 millimetres and has not spread outside the oropharynx
*Any size and has spread to only one [[lymph node]] on the same side of the neck as the cancer. The [[lymph node]] with cancer is 30 millimetres or smaller.

===Stage 4A===
*Cancer has spread to tissues near the oropharynx, including the [[voice box]], roof of the mouth, [[Human lower jaw|lower jaw]], [[muscle of the tongue]] or central muscles of the jaw and may have spread to one or more nearby [[lymph nodes]]; none larger than 60 millimetres.
*Cancer is any size and has spread to one [[lymph node]] that is larger than 30 millimetres but not larger than 60 millimetres on the same side of the neck as the cancer or to more than one [[lymph node]], none larger than 60 millimetres, on one of both sides of the neck.

===Stage 4B===
*Cancer surrounds the main [[artery]] in the neck or has spread to bones in the jaw or skull, to muscle in the side of the jaw or to the upper part of the throat behind the nose and may have spread to nearby [[lymph nodes]]
*Cancer has spread to a [[lymph node]] that is larger than 60 millimetres and may have spread to [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] around the [[oropharynx]].

===Stage 4C===
Cancer has spread to other parts of the body; the [[tumor]] may be any size and may have spread to [[lymph nodes]].

Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) is a type of [[head and neck cancer]] that begins in the [[oropharynx]], the middle part of the throat that includes the [[soft palate]], the base of the [[tongue]], the [[tonsil]]s and the side and back wall of the throat.<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_1X_What_is_oral_cavity_and_oropharyngeal_cancer_60.asp What Are Oral Cavity and Oropharyngeal Cancers?]</ref> Squamous cell cancers of the tonsils are more strongly associated with [[human papillomavirus]] infection than are cancers of other regions of the head and neck.

==Society and culture==
