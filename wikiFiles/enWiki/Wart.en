A '''wart''' is generally a small, rough growth, typically on a human’s hands or feet but often other locations, that can resemble a cauliflower or a solid [[blister]]. They are caused by a [[Virus|viral]] infection, specifically by one of the many types of ''[[human papillomavirus]] (HPV)''. There are as many as 10 varieties of warts, the most common considered to be mostly harmless. It is possible to get warts from others; they are contagious and usually enter the body in an area of broken skin.<ref>http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/tc/warts-and-plantar-warts-topic-overview</ref> They typically disappear after a few months but can last for years and can recur.<ref>medline plus warts National institutes of Health.</ref>

==Types==
A range of types of wart have been identified, varying in shape and site affected, as well as the type of human papillomavirus involved.<ref>''Mosby's Medical, Nursing, & Allied Health Dictionary'' (5th edn), Anderson KN, Anderson LE, Glanze WD, eds, Mosby</ref><ref>{{cite web

| title = MedlinePlus: Warts
| year = 2010}}</ref> These include:
* Common wart (''Verruca vulgaris''), a raised wart with roughened surface, most common on hands, but can grow anywhere on the body;
* [[Verruca plana|Flat wart]] (''Verruca plana''), a small, smooth flattened wart, flesh-coloured, which can occur in large numbers; most common on the face, neck, hands, wrists and knees;
* Filiform or digitate wart, a thread- or finger-like wart, most common on the face, especially near the eyelids and lips;
* [[Genital wart]] (venereal wart, ''Condyloma acuminatum'', ''Verruca acuminata''), a wart that occurs on the genitalia.
* Mosaic wart, a group of tightly clustered plantar-type warts, commonly on the hands or soles of the feet;
* [[Periungual wart]], a cauliflower-like cluster of warts that occurs around the nails.
* [[Plantar wart]] (verruca, ''Verruca plantaris''), a hard sometimes painful lump, often with multiple black specks in the center; usually only found on pressure points on the soles of the feet;

Many HPV types can produce a benign growth, often called a "wart" or "papilloma", in the area they infect. Many of the more common HPV and wart types are listed below.
* Common warts - HPV types 2 and 4 (most common); also types 1, 3, 26, 29, and 57 and others.

== Pathophysiology ==
Common warts have a characteristic appearance under the microscope.  They have thickening of the [[stratum corneum]] (hyperkeratosis), thickening of the [[stratum spinosum]] (acanthosis), thickening of the [[stratum granulosum]], [[rete ridge]] elongation, and large [[blood vessel]]s at the [[dermoepidermal junction]].

== Prevention ==

[[Gardasil]] is an [[HPV vaccine]] aimed at preventing cervical cancers and genital warts.  [[Gardasil]] is designed to prevent infection with [[human papillomavirus|HPV]] types 16, 18, 6, and 11. HPV types 16 and 18 currently cause about 70% of [[cervical cancer]] cases,<ref name="pmid16670757" /><ref name="Muñoz2004" /> and also cause some [[vulvar cancer|vulvar]], [[vaginal cancer|vaginal]],<ref name=VulvarCA /> [[penile cancer|penile]] and [[anal cancer]]s.<ref name="Bloomberg" /> HPV types 6 and 11 are responsible for 90% of documented cases of genital warts.<ref name=NEJM>{{cite web |title=Perspective - The Potential of Human Papillomavirus Vaccines |first= Robert |last=Steinbrook |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/11/1109 |date= March 16, 2006}}</ref> Unfortunately the HPV vaccines do not currently prevent the virus strain responsible for [[verrucas]] (plantar warts).

==Treatment==
There are many treatments and procedures associated with wart removal. One review of 52 clinical trials of various cutaneous wart treatments concluded that topical treatments containing [[salicylic acid]] were the best supported, with an average cure rate of 75%, compared with 48% for the placebo in six placebo-controlled trials including a total of 376 participants.<ref name=Cochrane>{{cite journal |author=Gibbs S, Harvey I, Sterling JC, Stark R |title=Local treatments for cutaneous warts |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD001781 |year=2003 |pmid=12917913 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001781 |url= |editor1-last=Gibbs |editor1-first=Sam}}</ref> The reviewers also concluded that there was little evidence of a significant benefit of [[cryotherapy]] over salicylic acid.<ref name=Cochrane/>

One complicating factor in the treatment of warts is that the wart may regrow after it has been removed.

===Medication===
[[Image:Wart ASA animated.gif|thumb|Two [[virus (biology)|viral]] warts on a middle finger, being treated with a mixture of acids (like salicylic acid) to remove them. A white precipitate forms on the area where the product was applied.]]
* [[Imiquimod]], a topical cream that helps the body's immune system fight the wart virus by encouraging [[interferon]] production.  Approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for genital warts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medscape Imiquimod article|url=http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/740315|accessdate=10 August 2011}}</ref> The drug is very expensive.
* [[Cantharidin]], a chemical found naturally in many members of the beetle family [[Meloidae]] which causes dermal blistering. Either used by itself or compounded with [[podophyllin]].  Not FDA approved, but available through Canada or select US compounding pharmacies.
* [[Bleomycin]], not US FDA approved.  One or two injections used. It can cause necrosis of digits and [[Raynaud syndrome]].<ref name="aafp.org" /><ref>Champion, R.H., et al.  Rook's Textbook of Dermatology.  Blackwell Science.  1998.  p. 1044</ref> 
* [[Dinitrochlorobenzene]] (DNCB), like [[salicylic acid]], this is applied directly to the wart. Studies showed this method was effective with a cure rate of 80%. But DNCB must be used much more cautiously than salicylic acid; the chemical is known to cause genetic mutations, so it must be administered by a physician. This drug induces an allergic immune response resulting in inflammation that wards off the wart-causing virus.<ref>[http://www.health.harvard.edu/fhg/updates/update0303d.shtml Health.harvard.edu]</ref>
* [[Fluorouracil]], which inhibits DNA synthesis, is being used as an experimental treatment.  It is applied directly to the wart (especially plantar warts) and covered (for example: with tape).  This treatment is combined with the use of a pumice stone, but tends to work very slowly.<ref>[http://www.podiatrytoday.com/article/2598 Podiatrytoday.com]</ref>
* [[Salicylic acid]] can be prescribed by a dermatologist in a higher concentration than that found in over-the-counter products.  There are several [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] options, commonly involving [[salicylic acid]], readily available at [[pharmacies]] and [[supermarket]]s.  There are typically two types of products: adhesive pads treated with salicylic acid or a bottle of concentrated salicylic acid solution. Removing a wart with salicylic acid can be done by cleaning the area, applying the acid, and removing the dead skin with a [[pumice]] stone or [[emery board]]. It may take up to a year to remove a wart.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. Application of natural salicyclic acid sources such as [[podophyllum]] resin paint may also be effective. [podophyllum resin I.P.'66 (20% w/v), benzoin I.P. (10% w/v), aloes I.P. (2% w/v), isopropyl alcohol I.P. to make (100% v/v)]

Another product available over-the-counter that can aid in wart removal is [[silver nitrate]] in the form of a [[caustic pencil]], which is also available at drug stores. In a placebo-controlled study of 70 patients, silver nitrate given over nine days resulted in clearance of all warts in 43% and improvement in warts in 26% one month after treatment compared to 11% and 14%, respectively, in the placebo group.<ref>[http://www.huidziekten.nl/richtlijnen/BADguidelineCutaneousWarts2001.pdf] {{cite doi|10.1046/j.1365-2133.2001.04066.x}}</ref> The instructions must be followed to minimize staining of skin and clothing. Occasionally pigmented scars may develop.

[[Cryosurgery]] or [[cryotherapy]] devices using a dimethyl ether - propane mixture are inexpensive.  A disadvantage is that the sponge applicator is too large for small warts, and the temperature achieved is not nearly as low as with liquid nitrogen.  Complications include blistering of normal skin if excess freezing is not controlled.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Several randomized, controlled trials have found that [[zinc sulfate]], consumed orally, often reduces or eliminates warts.<ref name=Stefanietal2009>{{cite journal |author=Stefani M, Bottino G, Fontenelle E, Azulay DR |title=Efficacy comparison between cimetidine and zinc sulphate in the treatment of multiple and recalcitrant warts |journal=An Bras Dermatol |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=23–9 |year=2009 |pmid=19377755 |doi= |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0365-05962009000100003&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yaghoobi R, Sadighha A, Baktash D |title=Evaluation of oral zinc sulfate effect on recalcitrant multiple viral warts: a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial |journal=J.

===Procedures===
[[Image:Liquid nitrogen spray tank.jpg|thumb|[[Liquid nitrogen]] spray tank]]
* [[Treatment of warts by keratolysis|Keratolysis]], of dead surface skin cells usually using [[salicylic acid]], blistering agents, immune system modifiers ("immunomodulators"), or [[formaldehyde]], often with mechanical paring of the wart with a pumice stone, blade etc.<ref>[http://dermatology.about.com/cs/warts/a/warts.htm Warts] at [[About.com]]</ref>
* [[Electrodesiccation]]<ref>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1194434 Pubmedcentral.nih.gov]</ref>
* [[Cryosurgery]], which involves freezing the wart (generally with [[liquid nitrogen]]), creating a blister between the wart and epidermal layer, after which the wart and the surrounding dead skin fall off by themselves.  An average of 3 to 4 treatments are required for warts on thin skin.  Warts on calloused skin like plantar warts might take dozens or more treatments.<ref name="aafp.org">[http://www.aafp.org/afp/20050815/647.html Aafp.org]</ref>
* Surgical [[curettage]] of the wart;
* [[Laser]] treatment - often with a pulse dye laser or carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) laser.  Pulse dye lasers (wavelength 582&nbsp;nm) work by selective absorption by blood cells (specifically haemoglobin).  CO<sub>2</sub> lasers work by selective absorption by water molecules.  Pulse dye lasers are less destructive and more likely to heal without scarring.  CO<sub>2</sub> laser works by vaporizing and destroying tissue and skin.  Laser treatments can be painful, expensive (though covered by many insurances), and can cause little scarring when used appropriately.  CO<sub>2</sub> lasers will require local anaesthetic. Pulse dye laser treatment does not need conscious sedation nor local anesthetic.  It takes 2 to 4 treatments but can be many more for extreme cases. Typically, 10-14 days are required between treatments. Preventative measures are important.<ref name="aafp.org" />
* Infrared coagulator - an intense source of infrared light in a small beam like a laser.  This works essentially on the same principle as laser treatment.  It is less expensive.  Like the laser, it can cause blistering pain and scarring.<ref>Halazs C. L. G., Treatment of common warts using the infrared coagulator.  The Journal of dermatologic surgery and oncology   ISSN 0148-0812.  1994, vol. 20, no4, pp. 252-256 (21 ref.)</ref>
*[[Duct tape occlusion therapy]] involves placing a piece of [[duct tape]] over the wart.

==Folk remedies==
A variety of traditional [[folk remedy|folk remedies]] and rituals claim to be able to remove warts.

In ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'', [[Mark Twain]] has his characters discuss a variety of such remedies.  Tom Sawyer proposes "spunk-water" (or "stump-water", the water collecting in the hollow of a tree stump) as a remedy for warts on the hand.  You put your hand into the water at midnight and say:

:''Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,''
:''Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts''

and then "walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody. Because if you speak the charm's busted."  This is held to be superior to [[Huckleberry Finn]]'s preferred remedy which involved throwing a dead [[cat]] into a graveyard.  Another remedy involves splitting a bean, drawing blood from the wart and putting it on one of the halves, and burying that half at a [[Crossroads (mythology)|crossroads]] at midnight.  The theory of operation is that the blood on the buried bean will draw away the wart.<ref>[[Mark Twain]], ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'', [[s:The Adventures of Tom Sawyer/Chapter VI|ch. 6]]</ref> Twain is recognized as an early collector and recorder of genuine American folklore.<ref>J. R. LeMaster, ''The Mark Twain Encyclopedia'' (Taylor and Francis, 1993; ISBN 0-8240-7212-X), pp. [http://books.google.com/books?id=zW1k-XS6XLEC&pg=PA295&lpg=PA295&dq=Twain+as+folklorist&source=bl&ots=9u-IcEWchy&sig=3DxkmrJDMH-dByK2PRgu5s_949E&hl=en&ei=FSfdTq6SMcHvggealozqDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFQQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=Twain%20as%20folklorist&f=false 293-294]</ref>

Similar practices are recorded elsewhere.  In Louisiana, one remedy for warts involves rubbing the wart with a potato, which is then buried; when the "buried potato dries up, the wart will be cured".<ref>Julie Yvonne Webb, "Louisiana Voodoo and Superstitions Relating to Health", ''HSMHA Health Reports'', April 1971, vol. 86, no. 4, pp. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1937133/pdf/hsmhahr00004-0005.pdf?tool=pmcentrez 291, 296-297]</ref>  Another remedy similar to Twain's is reported from [[Northern Ireland]], where water from a specific well on [[Rathlin Island]] is credited with the power to cure warts.<ref>Linda-May Ballard, "An Approach to Traditional Cures in Ulster", [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2629017/ Ulster Med J. 2009 January; 78(1): 26–33].</ref>

[[File:Bufo bufo 01 13Jul2009.jpg|thumb|right|Despite their appearance, [[True toad|toads]] do not cause warts.]]
A longstanding tradition holds that touching [[true toad|toad]]s will cause warts.  The most common Northern Hemisphere toads have glands that protrude from their skin that superficially resemble warts.  Warts are caused by a virus, and toads do not harbor it.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/life/zoology/reptiles-amphibians/toads-cause-warts.htm | title=Do toads cause warts? | publisher=science.howstuffworks.com | accessdate=October 20, 2012 | author=Clark, Josh | pages=2}}</ref>
