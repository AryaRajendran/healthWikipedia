'''Osteitis fibrosa cystica''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|ɒ|s|t|iː|ˈ|aɪ|t|ɨ|s|_|f|aɪ|ˈ|b|r|oʊ|s|ə|_|ˈ|s|ɪ|s|t|ɨ|k|ə}}),<ref>{{USdict|ŏs′·tē·īt′·əs fī·brō′·sə sĭs′·tə·kə}}</ref> abbreviated OFC, and also known as '''osteitis fibrosa''', '''osteodystrophia fibrosa''', '''Von Recklinghausen's Disease of Bone''', not to be confused with '''[[Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen|Von Recklinghausen's]] disease''' ([[neurofibromatosis type I]]). Osteitis Fibrosa Cystica is a [[skeletal system|skeletal disorder]] caused by a surplus of [[parathyroid hormone]] from over-active [[parathyroid glands]]. This surplus stimulates the activity of [[osteoclast]]s, cells that break down bone, in a process known as osteoclastic [[bone resorption]]. The over-activity of the parathyroid glands ([[hyperparathyroidism]]) can be triggered by [[parathyroid adenoma]], [[hereditary]] factors, [[parathyroid carcinoma]], or [[renal osteodystrophy]].
Osteoclastic bone resorption releases minerals, including [[calcium]], from the bone into the bloodstream. In addition to elevated blood calcium levels, over-activity of this process results in a loss of bone mass, a weakening of the bones as their calcified supporting structures are replaced with fibrous tissue ([[Trabecula|peritrabecular]] [[fibrosis]]), and the formation of [[cyst]]-like [[brown tumor]]s in and around the bone. The symptoms of the disease are the consequences of both the general softening of the bones and the excess calcium in the blood, and include [[bone fractures]], [[kidney stones]], [[nausea]], appetite loss, and weight loss.

First described in the nineteenth century, OFC is currently detected through a combination of [[blood testing]], [[X-rays]], and [[biopsy|tissue sampling]]. Before 1950, around half of those diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism in the United States saw it progress to OFC, but with early identification techniques and improved treatment methods, instances of OFC in developed countries are increasingly rare. Where treatment is required, it normally involves addressing the underlying hyperparathyroidism before commencing long-term treatment for OFC&mdash;depending on its cause and severity, this can range from hydration and exercise to surgical intervention.

==Classification==

Osteitis fibrosa cystica is defined as the classic skeletal manifestation of advanced [[hyperparathyroidism]].  Under the [[ICD-10]] classification system, established by the [[World Health Organization]], OFC is listed under category E21.0, primary hyperparathyroidism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/ |title=Chapter 4: Endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases. |accessdate=2009-03-21 |date=2006-12-11 |work=World Health Organization |publisher=WHO }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==

The major symptoms of OFC are bone pain or tenderness, [[bone fracture]]s, and skeletal deformities such as bowing of the bones.  The underlying [[hyperparathyroidism]] may cause [[kidney stone]]s, [[nausea]], [[constipation]], fatigue and weakness. [[X-ray]]s may indicate thin bones, fractures, bowing, and cysts. Fractures are most commonly localized in the arms, legs, or spine.<ref name="MedlinePlus">{{cite news |title=Osteitis fibrosa |date=2008-09-25 |publisher=[[U.S. National Library of Medicine]] |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001252.htm |work =[[MedlinePlus]] |accessdate = 2008-10-04}}</ref><ref name="Tc99m">{{cite journal |pages=5138–41 |doi=10.1210/jc.86.11.5138 |ref=harv |title=Tc99m-Sestamibi Uptake in Osteitis Fibrosa Cystica Simulating Metastatic Bone Disease |year=2001 |last1=Rubin |first1=M.

==Causes==

[[File:Illu thyroid parathyroid.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram showing position of the parathyroid glands beside the thyroid]]

Osteitis fibrosa cystica is the result of unchecked hyperparathyroidism, or the overactivity of the [[parathyroid glands]], which results in an overproduction of [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH). PTH causes the release of calcium from the bones into the blood, and the reabsorption of calcium in the kidney. Thus, excess PTH in hyperparathyroidism causes elevated blood calcium levels, or [[hypercalcemia]].<ref name=histsurg>{{Harvnb|Ellis|2002|p=210}}</ref>
There are four major causes of primary hyperparathyroidism that result in OFC:

*'''Parathyroid Adenoma'''
The vast majority of cases of hyperparathyroidism are the result of the random formation of benign, but metabolically active, [[parathyroid adenoma]] swellings. These instances comprise approximately 80–85% of all documented cases of hyperparathyroidism.<ref name="Mayo Clinic">{{cite journal |pages=87–91 |doi=10.4065/77.1.87 |ref=harv |title=Medical and Surgical Management of Hyperparathyroidism |year=2002 |last1=Kearns |first1=A. E. |last2=Thompson |first2=G. B. |journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings |volume=77 |pmid=11794462 |issue=1}}</ref>

*'''Hereditary factors'''
Approximately 1 in 10 documented cases of hyperparathyroidism are a result of [[hereditary]] factors. Disorders such as familial hyperparathyroidism, [[multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1]] (MEN Type 1) and hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome can, if left unchecked, result in OFC.<ref name="Mayo Clinic" /> MEN Type 1 is an [[autosomal]] [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] disorder and the most common hereditary form of hyperparathyroidism, affecting about 95% of genetic cases of OFC, and also tends to affect younger patients than other forms. Major mutations which can lead to hyperparathyroidism generally involve the parathyroid hormone receptor, [[G protein]]s, or [[adenylate cyclase]].<ref>{{cite journal |pages= 673–6 |doi=10.1001/archsurg.133.6.673 |ref=harv |title= Osteitis Fibrosa Cystica with Renal Parathyroid Hormone Resistance: A Review of Pseudohypoparathyroidism with Insight into Calcium Homeostasis |year= 1998 |last1= Eubanks |first1= P.

*'''Parathyroid carcinoma'''
[[Parathyroid carcinoma]] ([[cancer]] of the [[parathyroid gland]]) is the rarest cause of OFC, accounting for about 0.5% of all cases of hyperparathyroidism. OFC onset by parathyroid carcinoma is difficult to diagnose.<ref name="Mayo Clinic" />

*'''Renal complications'''
OFC is a common presentation of [[renal osteodystrophy]], which is a term used to refer to the skeletal complications of  [[Chronic kidney disease|end stage renal disease]] (ESRD). OFC occurs in approximately 50% of patients with ESRD.<ref name="Renal
Osteodystrophy">{{cite web|url=http://path.upmc.edu/cases/case139/dx.html |title=Final Diagnosis &ndash; Brown Tumor (Giant Cell Tumor of Hyperparathyroidism) |accessdate=2008-11-17 |last=Mourelatos |first=Zissimos |coauthors=Herbert Goldberg, Grant Sinson, Dianna Quan, Ehud Lavi |date=2005-07-03 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine }}</ref>  ESRD occurs when the [[kidneys]] fail to produce [[calcitriol]], a form of [[Vitamin D]], which assists in the absorption of calcium into the bones. When calcitriol levels decrease, parathyroid hormone levels increase, halting the storage of calcium, and instead triggering its removal from the bones.<ref>{{cite news | first=James | last=Delmez | title=Renal Osteodystrophy | date=2005-01 | publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | url=http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/pdf/renalosteodystrophy.pdf | work=National Institute of Health | accessdate=2009-04-06 }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
The effects of OFC on bone are largely dependent on the duration of the disease and the level of parathyroid hormone (PTH) produced.<ref name="FNA">{{cite journal |pages=157–60 |doi=10.1002/dc.2840010212 |ref=harv |title=Fine needle aspiration of osteitis fibrosa cystica |year=1985 |last1=Watson |first1=Carolyn W. |last2=Unger |first2=Pamela |last3=Kaneko |first3=Mamoru |last4=Gabrilove |first4=Jacques L. |journal=Diagnostic Cytopathology |volume=1 |issue=2 |pmid=3836078}}</ref>  PTH is responsible for maintaining a [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] calcium concentration in the blood.  It activates the parathyroid-hormone related protein receptor located on [[osteoblast]]s and [[osteocyte]]s, both of which are responsible for the building and [[calcification]] of bone.  Abnormalities affecting the parathyroid glands cause a surplus of PTH, which, in turn, increases the activity and frequency of osteoblasts and osteocytes.<ref name="pmid18046581">{{cite journal |pages=195–207 |doi=10.1007/s00467-007-0671-3 |ref=harv |title=Chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder in children |year=2007 |last1=Wesseling |first1=Katherine |last2=Bakkaloglu |first2=Sevcan |last3=Salusky |first3=Isidro |journal=Pediatric Nephrology |volume=23 |issue=2 |pmid=18046581 |pmc=2668632}}</ref>  Increased PTH levels trigger the release of stored calcium through the dissolution of old bone, as well as the conservation of serum calcium through a cessation in the production of new bone.<ref name=Campbell>{{Harvnb|Campbell|1987|p=895}}</ref><ref name=Anatomy>{{Harvnb|Patton|1996|pp=559&ndash;61}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
OFC may be diagnosed using a variety of techniques.  Muscles in patients afflicted with OFC can either appear unaffected or "bulked up." If muscular symptoms appear upon the onset of hyperparathyroidism, they are generally sluggish contraction and relaxation of the muscles.<ref name="Electrodiagnosis164" >{{Harvnb|Eberstein|1983|p=164}}</ref> Deviation of the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] (a condition in which the trachea shifts from its position at the midline of the neck),  in conjunction with other known symptoms of OFC can point to a diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma.<ref name="pmid11603552" />

Blood tests on patients with OFC generally show high levels of [[calcium]] (normal levels are considered to range between 8.5 and 10.2&nbsp;mg/dL,<ref name=NIHSerumCalcium>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title= Serum calcium | date=2007-10-30 | publisher=[[U.S. National Library of Medicine]] | url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003477.htm | work =[[MedlinePlus]] | pages = | accessdate = 2009-10-27 | language = }}</ref> [[parathyroid hormone]] (levels generally above 250&nbsp;[[picogram|pg]]/mL, as opposed to the "normal" upper-range value of  65 pg/mL<ref name="PTH Levels">{{cite journal |pmid=16690460 |pmc=1482827 |ref=harv |year=2006 |last1=Aloia |first1=JF |last2=Feuerman |first2=M |last3=Yeh |first3=JK |title=Reference range for serum parathyroid hormone |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=137–44 |journal=Endocrine practice}}</ref>),<ref name=NephrologySecrets>{{Harvnb|Hricik|2003|p=323}}</ref> and [[alkaline phosphatase]]<ref name="MedlinePlus" />(normal range is 20 to 140 [[International unit|IU]]/L<ref name=NIHphosphatase>{{cite news | title=ALP isoenzyme test | date=2009-05-07 | publisher=[[U.S. National Library of Medicine]] | url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003497.htm | work=[[MedlinePlus]] | accessdate=2009-10-26 }}</ref>).

X-rays may also be used to diagnose the disease. Usually, these X-rays will show extremely thin bones, which are often bowed or fractured. However, such symptoms are also associated with other bone diseases, such as [[osteopenia]] or [[osteoporosis]].<ref name="pmid18704965">{{cite journal |pages=1497–504 |doi=10.1002/hed.20905 |ref=harv |title=Evolution of maxillofacial brown tumors after parathyroidectomy in primary hyperparathyroidism |year=2008 |last1=Reséndiz-Colosia |first1=Jaime Alonso |last2=Rodríguez-Cuevas |first2=Sergio Arturo |last3=Flores-Díaz |first3=Rutilio |last4=Juan |first4=Martín Hernández-San |last5=Gallegos-Hernández |first5=José Francisco |last6=Barroso-Bravo |first6=Sinhué |last7=Gómez-Acosta |first7=Fernando |journal=Head & Neck |volume=30 |issue=11}}</ref> Generally, the first bones to show symptoms via X-ray are the fingers.<ref name="pmid11872764"/> Furthermore, brown tumors, especially when manifested on facial bones, can be misdiagnosed as cancerous.<ref name="pmid18704965" /> Radiographs distinctly show bone resorption and X-rays of the skull may depict an image often described as "ground glass" or "salt and pepper".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kidney.org/Professionals/kdoqi/guidelines_ckd/p6_comp_g10.htm |title=Association of Level Oo GFR with Bone Disease And Disorders of Calcium And Phosphorus Metabolism |accessdate=2008-11-17 |year=2002 |work=NKF K/DOQI Guidelines |publisher=National Kidney Foundation }}</ref><ref name="UCLAHEALTH">{{cite news | first=Robert | last=Hurd | title=Osteitis fibrosa | date=2006-08-11 | publisher=UCLA | url=http://www.uclahealth.org/body.cfm?xyzpdqabc=0&id=477&action=detail&AEProductIDSRC=Adam2004_1&AEArticleID=001252&AEProductID=Adam2004_1&AEProjectTypeIDURL=APT_1 | work=UCLA Health | accessdate=2008-10-22}}</ref>  [[Dental radiography|Dental X-rays]] may also be abnormal.<ref name="MedlinePlus" />
[[Image:Osteitis Fibrosis Cystica.jpg|thumb|right|Histology of bone showing osteitis fibrosa cystica. ([[Fibrosis]] and intratrabecular tunnels are seen).]]

Cysts may be lined by [[osteoclast]]s and sometimes blood pigments, which lend to the notion of "brown tumors." Such cysts can be identified with [[nuclear imaging]] combined with specific [[Radioactive tracer|tracers]], such as [[sestamibi]].<ref name="Tc99m" /> Identification of muscular degeneration or lack of reflex can occur through clinical testing of deep tendon reflexes, or via photomotogram (an [[achilles tendon]] [[reflex test]]).<ref name="Electrodiagnosis164" /><ref name="pmid18748025">{{cite journal |pmid=18748025 |pmc=1237752 |ref=harv |year=1977 |title=Photomotogram (achilles reflex test) |volume=127 |issue=2 |pages=177 |journal=The Western journal of medicine}}</ref>

[[needle aspiration biopsy|Fine needle aspiration]] (FNA) can be used to [[biopsy]] [[Lesion|bone lesions]], once found on an X-ray or other scan. Such tests can be vital in diagnosis and can also prevent unnecessary treatment and invasive surgery.<ref name="pmid18702368">{{cite journal |pages=471–4 |doi=10.1159/000325556 |ref=harv |title=Fine Needle Aspiration Diagnosis of Osteitis Fibrosa Cystica (Brown Tumor of Bone) |year=2008 |last1=Kemp |first1=Anna M.

The brown tumors commonly associated with OFC display many of the same characteristics of osteoclasts.<ref name="pmid11603552" />  These cells are characteristically benign, feature a dense, granular [[cytoplasm]], and a nucleus that tends to be ovular in shape, enclosing comparatively fine [[chromatin]].  [[Nucleoli]] also tend to be smaller than average.<ref name="FNA" />

==Management==
===Medical===
Medical management of OFC consists of Vitamin D treatment, generally alfacalcidol or [[calcitriol]], delivered intravenously.  Studies have shown that in cases of OFC caused by either end-stage renal disease or primary hyperparathyoidism, this method is successful not only in treating underlying hyperparathyoidism, but also in causing the regression of brown tumors and other symptoms of OFC.<ref name= "Regression">{{cite journal |pages=2480–3 |doi=10.1210/jc.2005-2518 |ref=harv |title=Regression of Skeletal Manifestations of Hyperparathyroidism with Oral Vitamin D |year=2006 |last1=Arabi |first1=A. |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism |volume=91 |issue=7}}</ref>

===Surgery===
In especially severe cases of OFC, parathyroidectomy, or the full removal of the parathyroid glands, is the chosen route of treatment. Parathyroidectomy has been shown to result in the reversal of bone resorption and the complete regression of brown tumors.<ref name= "Regression" /> In situations where parathyroid carcinoma is present, surgery to remove the tumors has also led to the regression of hyperparathyroidism as well as the symptoms of OFC.<ref name="pmid4107487">{{cite journal |pages=596–604 |pmc=477103 |doi=10.1136/jcp.24.7.596 |ref=harv |title=Recurrent hyperparathyroidism due to parathyroid carcinoma |year=1971 |last1=Ellis |first1=H.

[[Bone grafting|Bone transplants]] have proven successful in filling the lesions caused by OFC.

Rates of OFC increase alongside cases of unchecked primary hyperparathyroidism.  In developing countries, such as India, rates of disease as well as case reports often mirror those published in past decades in the developed world.<ref name="pmid11350446">{{cite journal |pages=708–14 |doi=10.1046/j.0007-1323.2001.01775.x |ref=harv |title=Unique clinical characteristics of primary hyperparathyroidism in India |year=2001 |last1=Mishra |first1=S.

The other 10% of cases are primarily caused by primary [[hyperplasia]], or an increase of the number of cells. Parathyroid carcinoma accounts for less than 1% of all cases,<ref name="pmid11603552" /> occurring most frequently in individuals around 50 years of age (in stark contrast to OFC as a result of primary hyperparathyroidism) and showing no gender preference.<ref name="pmid11603552" /> Approximately 95% of hyperparatyhroidism caused by genetic factors is attributed to MEN type 1. This mutation also tends to affect younger individuals.<ref name="Mayo Clinic" />

The condition was first described by Gerhard Engel in 1864 and [[Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen]] in 1890, though [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]], who died in 1783, is credited with finding the first example of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1260–1261 |doi=10.1093/rheumatology/keg003 |ref=harv |title=William Hunter (1718-1783) |year=2003 |last1=Buchanan |first1=W.

The discovery and subsequent description of the parathyroid glands is credited to Ivar Sandstrom, though his publication, ''On a New Gland in Man and Several Mammals-Glandulae Parathyroideae'', received little attention.  [[Gustaf Retzius]] and [[Eugene Gley]] compounded his research, the latter credited with the discovery of the function of the parathyroid glands.<ref name="Early Survey" />  This research cumulated in the first surgical removal of a parathyroid tumor by Felix Mandel in 1925. A 2.5&nbsp;×&nbsp;1.5-inch (64&nbsp;×&nbsp;38&nbsp;mm) tumor was removed from the thyroid artery of a man suffering from advanced OFC. The patient's symptoms disappeared, only to return in approximately six years as a result of [[renal stones]] that were diagnosed only after the patient had died. In 1932, blood tests on a female patient suffering from renal stone-based OFC revealed extremely high blood [[calcium]] levels. [[Fuller Albright]] diagnosed and treated the woman, who suffered from a large tumor of the neck as well as renal stones.<ref name= "histsurg" />

The first published literature to describe a brown tumor (which was linked to OFC) was published in 1953, though clinical reports from before 1953 do draw a correlation between the disease and tumors previous to the publication.<ref name="pmid19830164">{{cite journal |doi=10.4076/1752-1947-3-7285 |ref=harv |title=A 60-year-old man with chronic renal failure and a costal mass: A case report and review of the literature |year=2009 |last1=Campuzano-Zuluaga |first1=Germán |last2=Velasco-Pérez |first2=William |last3=Marín-Zuluaga |first3=Juan Ignacio |journal=Journal of Medical Case Reports |volume=3 |pages=7285 |pmid=19830164 |pmc=2737768}}</ref>

The advent of the multichannel autoanalyzer in the 1960s and 70s led to an increase in early diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism.  This increase led to a sharp decline in the prolonged manifestation of the disease, leading to a drop in the number of cases of OFC due to the early detection of hyperparathyroidism.<ref name=TheParathyroids350>{{Harvnb|Levine|2001|p=350}}</ref> Before this invention, the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism was generally prolonged until the emergence of severe manifestations, such as OFC.<ref name=TheParathyroids403>{{Harvnb|Levine|2001|p=403}}</ref>
