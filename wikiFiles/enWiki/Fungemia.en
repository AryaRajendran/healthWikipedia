'''Fungemia''' is the presence of [[fungus|fungi]] or [[yeast]]s in the [[blood]]. It is most commonly caused by ''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida]]'' species (also known as '''Candidemia''', '''Candedemia''', and '''Invasive Candidiasis'''), but can be caused by other fungi as well, including ''[[Saccharomyces]]'', ''[[Aspergillus]]'' and ''[[Cryptococcus (fungus)|Cryptococcus]]''. It is most commonly seen in [[immunosuppressed]] or [[immunocompromised]] [[patient]]s with severe [[neutropenia]], [[oncology]] patients, or in patients with intravenous [[catheter]]s.  Recently, it has been suggested the otherwise immunocompetent patients taking [[infliximab]] may be at a higher risk for fungemia.

The [[diagnosis]] is complicated, as routine [[blood culture]]s have poor sensitivity.  

==Treatment==
Treatment involves use of [[antifungals]], e.g. [[fluconazole]] or [[amphotericin]].

==Risk factors==
{{columns-list|2|
The three most important risk factors are:

* Use of [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]]s
* Presence of mercury and other heavy metals.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
* Colonization by fungi (see e.g. [[candidiasis]])

Other risk factors are:

* [[Dialysis]]
* [[Diabetes]]
* Lowered intestinal flora
* Suppressed [[Immune system]]
* Use of yeast probiotics
* [[Central venous catheter]]
* High severity of illness
* Multiple [[abdominal]] [[surgery|surgeries]]
* Use of [[steroid]]s
* [[Burn (injury)|burn]]s
}}

==Pathogens==
The most commonly known [[pathogen]] is ''[[Candida albicans]]'', causing roughly 70% of fungemias, followed by ''[[Candida glabrata]]'' with 10%, ''[[Aspergillus]]'' with 1% and ''[[Saccharomyces]]'' as the fourth most common.{{fact|date=August 2010}} However, the frequency of infection by ''C. glabrata'', ''[[Saccharomyces boulardii]]'', ''[[Candida tropicalis]]'', ''[[Candida krusei|C. krusei]]'' and ''[[Candida parapsilosis|C. parapsilosis]]'' is increasing, perhaps because significant use of [[fluconazole]] is common or due to increase in antibiotic use.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms can range from mild to extreme, often described as extreme [[flu-like symptoms]]. Pain, mental disorders, chronic [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[infections]], are a few of the long list of associated symptoms with Fungemia. Skin infections can include persistent or unhealing wounds and lesions, sweating, itching, unusual discharge or drainage and more.
