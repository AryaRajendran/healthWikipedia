'''Cervical screening''' is a way of preventing [[cervical cancer]] from developing, and diagnosing the disease at an early pre-cancerous stage. In the USA, cervical screening is usually performed using the [[Pap test]] (or 'smear test'),<ref>[http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspscerv.htm, Screening: Cervical cancer], US Preventive Services Task Force (accessed 28/01/2011)</ref> though the UK screening programmes changed the screening method to liquid-based cytology in 2008.<ref>[http://www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk/cervical/lbc.html Liquid Based Cytology (LBC)], NHS cervical screening programme (accessed 28/03/2011)</ref>

Screening tests look for pre-cancerous changes in the [[cervix]] that could develop into cervical cancer. If the abnormal tissue or cells can be removed, then the disease can be prevented from developing and causing problems. The tests can also diagnose the disease by identifying cancer cells that are already present.

==Types of screening==   
  
===Conventional cytology===   
{{main|Pap test}}
In the conventional Pap smear, the physician collecting the cells smears them on a microscope slide and applies a fixative. In general, the slide is sent to a laboratory for evaluation.

* [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] 94%   
    
===Liquid-based monolayer cytology===   

Since the mid-1990s, techniques based on placing the sample into a vial containing a liquid medium that preserves the cells have been increasingly used. Two of the types are Sure-Path (TriPath Imaging) and Thin-Prep ([[Cytyc]] Corp). The media are primarily [[ethanol]]-based for Sure-Path and methanol for ThinPrep. Once placed into the vial, the sample is processed at the laboratory into a cell thin-layer, stained, and examined by light microscopy. The liquid sample has the advantage of being suitable for high-risk HPV testing and may reduce unsatisfactory specimens from 4.1% to 2.6%.<ref name="pmid17517761">{{cite journal |author=Ronco G, Cuzick J, Pierotti P, ''et al.'' |title=Accuracy of liquid based versus conventional cytology: overall results of new technologies for cervical cancer screening randomised controlled trial |journal= BMJ|volume= 335|issue= 7609|pages= 28|year=2007 |pmid=17517761 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39196.740995.BE |pmc=1910655}}</ref> Proper sample acquisition is crucial to the accuracy of the test, as a cell that is not in the sample cannot be evaluated.

A study published in 2007 suggested that the act of performing a Pap smear produces an inflammatory [[cytokine]] response, which may initiate immunologic clearance of HPV, therefore reducing the risk of cervical cancer. Women that had even a single Pap smear in their history had a lower incidence of cancer. "A statistically significant decline in the HPV positivity rate correlated with the lifetime number of Pap smears received."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Passmore JA, Morroni C, Shapiro S, Williamson AL, Hoffman M |title=Papanicolaou smears and cervical inflammatory cytokine responses |journal=J Inflamm (Lond) |volume=4 |issue= |pages=8 |year=2007 |pmid=17456234 |pmc=1868022 |doi=10.1186/1476-9255-4-8 |url=http://www.journal-inflammation.com/content/4//8}}</ref>

===Testing in resource-poor areas ===   

Many resource-poor areas cannot provide regular screening, and must rely on infrequent screening. A study of cervical cancer screening of 131,746 women in rural India found that a single DNA test reduced the number of advanced cervical cancers and deaths over 8 years, while a single acetic acid examination or a single Pap screening did not. However, the DNA test cost US $30–40, which was unaffordable in many regions, it is time-consuming, and requires a sophisticated laboratory infrastructure. A simple, affordable, and accurate test is being evaluated in China and other countries.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sankaranarayanan R, Nene BM, Shastri SS, ''et al.'' |title=HPV screening for cervical cancer in rural India |journal=N.

===Other options===   

The [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] has funded an eight-year study of a DNA test for the virus that causes cervical cancer. The test manufactured by Qiagen for a low cost per test with results available in only a few hours may allow reduction in use of annual Pap smears. The test has been shown to work "acceptably well" on women who take the swabs themselves rather than allowing a physician to test. This may improve the chances of early diagnosis for women who are unwilling to be screened due to discomfort or modesty.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/07/health/07virus.html?_r=2&em | work=The New York Times | title=DNA Test Outperforms Pap Smear | first=Donald G. | last=McNeil Jr | date=2009-04-07 | accessdate=2010-05-21}}</ref>

===Visual inspection to detect pre-cancer or cancer===

In areas where Pap smear screening is not available or affordable, other methods of testing have been evaluated.

Visual inspection of the cervix, using acetic acid ([[white vinegar]]; VIA) or Lugol’s iodine (VILI) to highlight precancerous lesions so they can be viewed with the "naked eye", shifts the identification of precancer from the laboratory to the clinic. Such procedures eliminate the need for laboratories and transport of specimens, require very little equipment and provide women with immediate test results. A range of medical professionals—doctors, nurses, or professional midwives—can effectively perform the procedure, provided they receive adequate training and supervision. As a screening test, VIA may perform as well as or better than cervical cytology in accurately identifying pre-cancerous lesions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sherris J, Wittet S, Kleine A, ''et al.'' |title=Evidence-based, alternative cervical cancer screening approaches in low-resource settings |journal=Int Perspect Sex Reprod Health |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=147–54 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19805020 |doi=10.1363/ifpp.35.147.09 }}</ref> This has been demonstrated in various studies where trained physicians and mid-level providers correctly identified between 45% and 79% of women at high risk of developing cervical cancer.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sankaranarayanan|first1=R|last2=Gaffikin|first2=L|last3=Jacob|first3=M|last4=Sellors|first4=J|last5=Robles|first5=S|title=A critical assessment of screening methods for cervical neoplasia|journal=International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics|volume=89|year=2005|pages=S4–S12|issn=00207292|doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2005.01.009}}</ref> By comparison, the sensitivity of cytology has been shown to be between 47 and 62%.  Cytology provides higher specificity (fewer false positives) than VIA.  Like cytology, one of the limitations of VIA is that results are highly dependent on the accuracy of an individual's interpretation. This means that initial training and on-going quality control are of paramount importance.  Increased false positives are particularly important in a screen-and-treat setting, since [[over-treatment]] and resulting impairment of fertility is more likely.

VIA can offer significant advantages over Pap in low-resource settings, particularly in terms of increased screening coverage, improved follow-up care and overall program quality. Due to the need for fewer specialized personnel and less infrastructure, training, and equipment, with VIA public health systems can offer cervical cancer screening in more remote (and less equipped) health care settings and can achieve higher coverage. Furthermore, providers can share the results of VIA with patients immediately, making it possible to screen and treat women during the same visit. This helps ensure that follow-up care can be provided on the spot and reduces the number of women who may miss out on treatment because they are not able to return to the clinic at another time. In a "screen and treat" project in Peru, for example, only 9% of women who screened positive failed to receive treatment in the single-visit approach, compared with 44% of women who were lost to treatment using a multi-visit model.<ref>Luciani S, Winkler J. Cervical Cancer prevention in Peru: Lessons learned from the TATI demonstration project. Washington, DC: Pan American Health Organization; 2006.</ref>

VIA has successfully been paired with cryotherapy, a relatively simple and inexpensive method of treating cervical lesions that can be performed by primary care physicians and mid-level providers.<ref name="Gage2003">{{cite journal|last1=Gage|first1=J|title=Follow-up care of women with an abnormal cytology in a low-resource setting|journal=Cancer Detection and Prevention|volume=27|issue=6|year=2003|pages=466–471|issn=0361090X|doi=10.1016/j.cdp.2003.09.004}}</ref>

==Screening Process==

The procedures for testing women using [[Pap smear]], [[liquid-based cytology]], or [[HPV test]]ing are similar. A sample of cells is collected from the cervix using a [[spatula]] or small brush. The cells are then checked for any abnormalities.

To take the sample of cells, the physician inserts an instrument, called a [[speculum]], inside the [[vagina]]. The speculum has two arms that spread the walls of the vagina apart so that the doctor or nurse can see the [[cervix]]. Then, they scrape the surface of the cervix with a spatula or small brush. This collects a sample of cells from the outer layer of the cervix. 

With a Pap smear, cells collected using a spatula are smeared onto a [[microscope slide|slide]] for examination under a [[microscope]]. In liquid-based cytology, a sample of cells is taken using a small brush. The cells are put it into a container of liquid, and analysed for abnormalities. Cervical cells to be tested for [[Human papillomavirus|HPV]] are collected in a similar way.

===Removal of Abnormal Cells===

Women may be told that they have CIN ([[cervical intraepithelial neoplasia]]), or CIS ([[carcinoma in situ]]) — these terms describe different levels of abnormality found in the cervical cells. Abnormal cells can be removed or destroyed using one of several different procedures.

[[Laser ablation]] and [[cryosurgery|cryotherapy]] treat just the part of the cervix that contains abnormal cells. Laser [[ablation]] uses a laser to burn away the abnormal cells, while cryotherapy uses a cold probe to freeze the cells away. These procedures allow normal cells to grow back in their place. The [[loop electrical excision procedure]] (called LLETZ or ‘large loop excision of the transformation zone’ in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]), [[cervical conization]] (or [[cone biopsy]]) and [[hysterectomy]] remove the whole area containing the cells that could become pre-cancerous or develop into cervical cancer.
