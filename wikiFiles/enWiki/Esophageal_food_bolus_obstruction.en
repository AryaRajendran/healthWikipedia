An '''esophageal food [[bolus (digestion)|bolus]] obstruction''' (or '''steakhouse syndrome'''<ref name=Steak>{{cite journal | last = Stadler | first = J. | coauthors = A. H. Hölscher, H. Feussner, J. Dittler and J. R. Siewert | year = 1989 | month = December | title =The "steakhouse syndrome". Primary and definitive diagnosis and therapy | journal =  Surgical Endoscopy | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 195–8 | doi =10.1007/BF02171545 | pmid = 2623551 }}</ref>) is a medical emergency caused by the obstruction of the [[esophagus]] by an ingested [[foreign body]].  It is usually associated with diseases that narrow the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the esophagus, such as [[eosinophilic esophagitis]], [[Schatzki ring]]s, peptic [[stenosis|stricture]]s, webs, or [[esophageal cancer|cancers]] of the esophagus; rarely it can be seen in disorders of the movement of the esophagus, such as [[nutcracker esophagus]].  While some esophageal food boluses can pass by themselves or with the assistance of medications, some require the use of [[endoscopy]] to push the obstructing food into the stomach, or [[endoscopic foreign body removal|remove]] it from the esophagus.

==Clinical presentation==
Many foods can lodge themselves in the [[esophagus]], but the most common are meats such as [[steak]], [[poultry]], or [[pork]]<ref name="BMJ">{{cite journal |author=Baraka A, Bikhazi G |title=Oesophageal foreign bodies |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=1 |issue=5957 |pages=561–3 |year=1975 |pmid=1139150 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.1.5957.561|pmc=1672660}}</ref> leading to the colourful description of the phenomenon as steakhouse syndrome.<ref name=Steak/>  People with food bolus obstruction typically display acute [[dysphagia]] (difficulty swallowing), often to the point that they cannot even swallow their [[saliva]], leading to drooling.  They may also  suffer from chest pain, neck pain, regurgitation of food, or painful swallowing ([[odynophagia]]).<ref name="pmid623968">{{cite journal |author=Nandi P, Ong GB |title=Foreign body in the oesophagus: review of 2394 cases |journal=The British journal of surgery |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=5–9 |year=1978 |pmid=623968 |doi=10.1002/bjs.1800650103}}</ref>

Patients with esophageal food [[bolus]]es are also at risk of complications, such as [[esophageal perforation|perforation of the esophagus]], and [[aspiration pneumonia|aspiration into the lungs]].  As a result, urgent treatment of patients with high-risk features, or a lengthy duration of symptoms, is recommended.<ref name="ASGE">{{cite journal |author=Eisen GM, Baron TH, Dominitz JA, ''et al.'' |title=Guideline for the management of ingested foreign bodies |journal=Gastrointestinal Endoscopy |volume=55 |issue=7 |pages=802–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12024131 |doi=10.1016/S0016-5107(02)70407-0}}</ref>

==Predisposing conditions==
[[Image:Schatzki ring 2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Esophagogastroduodenoscopy|Endoscopic]] image of a Schatzki ring which is a common cause of esophageal food bolus obstruction]]

Food bolus obstruction is most commonly caused by [[Schatzki ring]]s, which are mucosal rings of unknown cause in the lower esophagus.<ref name=Steak/><ref name="pmid11174291">{{cite journal |author=Longstreth GF, Longstreth KJ, Yao JF |title=Esophageal food impaction: epidemiology and therapy.

An increasingly commonly recognized cause for esophageal food bolus obstruction is [[eosinophilic esophagitis]], which is an inflammatory disorder of the [[mucosa]] of the esophagus, of unknown cause.<ref name=Matthew>{{cite journal |author=Kerlin P, Jones D, Remedios M, Campbell C |title=Prevalence of eosinophilic esophagitis in adults with food bolus obstruction of the esophagus |journal=Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=356–61 |year=2007 |pmid=17413601 |doi=10.1097/01.mcg.0000225590.08825.77}}</ref><ref name="pmid14508223">{{cite journal |author=Cheung KM, Oliver MR, Cameron DJ, Catto-Smith AG, Chow CW |title=Esophageal eosinophilia in children with dysphagia |journal=Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=498–503 |year=2003 |pmid=14508223 |doi=10.1097/00005176-200310000-00018}}</ref> Many alterations caused by eosinophilic esophagitis can predispose to food boluses; these include the presence of multiple rings and narrowing of the lumen.<ref name="pmid17683993">{{cite journal |author=Cohen MS, Kaufman AB, Palazzo JP, Nevin D, Dimarino AJ, Cohen S |title=An audit of endoscopic complications in adult eosinophilic esophagitis |journal=Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=1149–53 |year=2007 |pmid=17683993 |doi=10.1016/j.cgh.2007.05.017}}</ref>  When considering esophageal dilation to treat a patient with food bolus obstruction, care must be made to look for features of eosinophilic esophagitis, as these patients are at a higher risk of dilation-associated complications.<ref name="pmid17914050">{{cite journal |author=Leclercq P, Marting A, Gast P |title=Eosinophilic esophagitis |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=357 |issue=14 |pages=1446; author reply 1446–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17914050 |doi=10.1056/NEJMc071646}}</ref>

Other conditions that predispose to food bolus obstructions are [[esophageal web]]s and peptic [[stenosis|stricture]]s.<ref name=Matthew/>  Food boluses are common in the course of illness in patients with [[esophageal cancer]] but are more difficult to treat as endoscopy to push the bolus is less safe.  Patients with esophageal [[self-expandable metallic stent]]s may present with food boluses lodged within the stent lumen.  Rarely disorders of movement of the esophagus, such as [[nutcracker esophagus]], can predispose to food bolus obstruction.<ref name="pmid12472482">{{cite journal |author=Chae HS, Lee TK, Kim YW, ''et al.'' |title=Two cases of steakhouse syndrome associated with nutcracker esophagus |journal=Diseases of the Esophagus |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=330–3 |year=2002 |pmid=12472482 |doi=10.1046/j.1442-2050.2002.00271.x}}</ref>

==Treatment==
[[Image:Roth net.jpg|thumb|right|The Roth net can be inserted through the endoscope to remove pieces of the obstructed food.]]
The standard treatment of food bolus obstruction is the use of [[endoscopy]] or fibre-optic cameras inserted by mouth into the esophagus.<ref name=ASGE/>  Endoscopes can be used to diagnose the cause of the food bolus obstruction, as well as to remove the obstruction.  Traditional endoscopic techniques involved the use of an overtube, a plastic tube inserted into the esophagus prior to the removal of the food bolus, in order to reduce the risk of aspiration into the [[lung]]s at the time of endoscopy.<ref name=Matthew/>  However, the '''push technique''', which involves insufflating air into the esophagus, and gently pushing the bolus toward the stomach instead, has emerged as a common and safe way of removing the obstruction.<ref name=Matthew/><ref name="Katsinelos">{{cite journal |author=Katsinelos P, Kountouras J, Paroutoglou G, Zavos C, Mimidis K, Chatzimavroudis G |title=Endoscopic techniques and management of foreign body ingestion and food bolus impaction in the upper gastrointestinal tract: a retrospective analysis of 139 cases |journal=Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology |volume=40 |issue=9 |pages=784–9 |year=2006 |pmid=17016132 |doi=10.1097/01.mcg.0000225602.25858.2c}}</ref>

Other tools may be used to remove food boluses.  The Roth Net® is a mesh net that can be inserted through the endoscope, and opened and closed from the outside; it can be used to retrieve pieces of obstructed food.  Snares, which are normally used to remove [[polyp (medicine)|polyps]] can be used to macerate the food causing the obstruction.  Dormia baskets, which are metal baskets used to remove stones from the [[common bile duct]] in a procedure known as [[endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography]], can be opened and closed from the outside in a similar manner to macerate food and facilitate removal.  [[Forceps]] used for [[biopsy|biopsies]] can also be employed in a similar manner.<ref name=Katsinelos/>

Historical treatment of food bolus obstruction included administration of [[proteolytic]] enzymes (such as [[meat tenderizer]]s), or even acidic substances, such as [[Coca-Cola]] with the purpose of degrading the meat that was blocked; however, this was often complicated by perforation of the esophagus.<ref name="pmid3921329">{{cite journal |author=Goldner F, Danley D |title=Enzymatic digestion of esophageal meat impaction.

Recently a combination therapy that uses intravenous [[glucagon]], an [[effervescent]] agent and water has been used as a less invasive method to relieve esophageal food bolus obstruction.  This procedure is performed by a [[radiologist]] or other qualifying physician using [[fluoroscopy]] to identify the location of the obstruction before the procedure and confirm successful clearance of food bolus after the procedure.  Glucagon relaxes the lower esophageal muscles, the effervescent agent distends the esophagus and [[hydrostatic pressure]] caused by the water and the use of gravity push the food bolus into the stomach.  There are however limitations to this technique and situations which would predispose the esophagus to rupture or the procedure to fail should be avoided.  Patients who don't qualify for the procedure or those who fail initial attempts should be treated with the standard endoscopic methods.  Appropriate patient selection is crucial for the procedure to succeed and to minimize complications.<ref name="pmid8310919">{{cite journal |author=Robbins MI, Shortsleeve MJ |title=Treatment of Acute Esophageal Food Impaction with Glucagon, an Effervescent Agent and Water |journal=AJR |volume=162 |issue=2 |pages=325–328 |year=1994 |pmid=8310919}}</ref>
