The era of cancer [[chemotherapy]] began in the 1940s with the first use of [[nitrogen mustard]]s and [[folic acid]] antagonist drugs. [[Cancer]] drug development has exploded since then into a multi-billion dollar industry. The [[targeted therapy]] revolution has arrived, but many of the principles and limitations of chemotherapy discovered by the early researchers still apply.

==The first efforts (1940–1952)==
The beginnings of the modern era of cancer chemotherapy can be traced directly to the German introduction of chemical warfare during World War I.  Among the chemical agents used, [[Mustard gas|mustard gas]] was particularly devastating.  Although banned by the [[Geneva Protocol]] in 1925, the advent of World War II caused concerns over the possible re-introduction of chemical warfare.  These concerns led to the discovery of [[nitrogen mustard]], a chemical warfare agent, as an effective treatment for cancer. Two [[pharmacologist]]s, [[Louis S. Goodman]] and [[Alfred Gilman (sr.)|Alfred Gilman]], were recruited by the [[United States Department of Defense]] to investigate potential therapeutic applications of [[chemical warfare]] agents. Goodman and Gilman observed that mustard gas was too volatile an agent to be suitable for laboratory experiments.  They exchanged a nitrogen molecule for sulfur and had a more stable compound in [[Nitrogen mustard|nitrogen mustard]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Weisse|first=Allen B.|title=Medical Odysseys: The Different and Sometimes Unexpected Pathways to Twentieth-Century Medical Discoveries|year=1991|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-1616-1|page=127}}</ref>   A year into the start of their research a [[Air Raid on Bari|German air raid in Bari, Italy]] led to the exposure of more than one thousand people to the [[John Harvey (ship)|SS ''John Harvey'']]'s secret cargo composed of [[mustard gas]] [[bombs]].  Dr. [[Stewart Francis Alexander]], a Lieutenant Colonel who was an expert in chemical warfare, was subsequently deployed to investigate the aftermath.  [[Autopsy|Autopsies]] of the victims suggested that profound [[lymphoid]] and [[myeloid]] suppression had occurred after exposure.  In his report Dr. Alexander theorized that since mustard gas all but ceased the division of certain types of [[somatic cell]]s whose nature it was to divide fast, it could also potentially be put to use in helping to suppress the division of certain types of cancerous cells.<ref name=li>{{cite book | last = Li | first = Jie Jack | title = Laughing Gas, Viagra, and Lipitor: The Human Stories behind the Drugs We Use | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2006 | page = 8 | isbn = 0-19-530099-8}}</ref>

Using this information, Goodman and Gilman reasoned that this agent could be used to treat [[lymphoma]], since lymphoma is a tumor of lymphoid cells. They first set up an animal model — they established lymphomas in [[mouse|mice]] and demonstrated they could treat them with mustard agents. Next, in collaboration with a thoracic surgeon, [[Gustav Linskog]], they injected a related agent, [[mustine]] (the prototype [[nitrogen mustard]] anticancer chemotherapeutic), into a patient with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. They observed a dramatic reduction in the patient's [[tumour]] masses. Although this effect lasted only a few weeks, and then had to return for  another set of treatment, this was the first step to the realization that cancer could be treated by pharmacological agents.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodman|1946}}</ref>

==Another leap forward — The antifolates==
[[File:Sidney Farber nci-vol-1926-300.jpg|thumb|Farber's work was instrumental in showing that effective pharmacological treatment of cancer was possible, and to this day, he is regarded as the [[list of persons considered father or mother of a field|father of modern chemotherapy]].]]
Shortly after World War II, a second approach to drug therapy of cancer began. [[Sidney Farber]], a [[pathologist]] at [[Harvard Medical School]], studied the effects of [[folic acid]] on leukemia patients. Folic acid, a [[vitamin]] crucial for DNA metabolism (he did not know the significance of [[History of molecular biology|DNA]] at that time), had been discovered by [[Lucy Wills]], when she was working in India, in 1937. It seemed to stimulate the proliferation of [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] (ALL) cells when administered to children with this cancer. In one of the first examples of rational drug design (rather than accidental discovery), in collaboration with [[Harriett Kilte]] and [[Yellapragada Subbarao]] of [[Lederle Laboratories]], Farber used folate analogues. These analogues — first [[aminopterin]] and then [[amethopterin]] (now methotrexate) were antagonistic to folic acid, and blocked the function of folate-requiring enzymes. When administered to children with ALL in 1948, these agents became the first drugs to induce remission in children with ALL. Remissions were brief, but the principle was clear — antifolates could suppress proliferation of malignant cells, and could thereby re-establish normal bone-marrow function. It is worth noting that Farber met resistance to conducting his studies at a time when the commonly held medical belief was that leukemia was incurable, and that the children should be allowed to die in peace. Afterwards, Farber's 1948 report in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] was met with incredulity and ridicule. 

In 1951, [[Jane C. Wright]] demonstrated the use of [[methotrexate]] in [[solid tumor]]s, showing remission in [[breast cancer]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Jane C. |last2=Prigot |first2=A. |last3=Wright |first3=B.P.  |title=An evaluation of folic acid antagonists in adults with neoplastic diseases. A study of 93 patients with incurable neoplasms. |journal=J Natl Med Assoc |volume=43 |issue= |pages=211-240 |year=1951 |pmid= |doi=}}</ref> Wright's group were the first to demonstrate use of the drug in solid tumors, as opposed to leukemias, which are a [[hematological malignancy|cancer of the marrow]]. Several years later at the [[National Cancer Institute]], [[Roy Hertz]] and [[Min Chiu Li]] then demonstrated complete remission in women with [[choriocarcinoma]] and [[chorioadenoma]] in 1956,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Li |first1=MC |last2=Hertz |first2=R |last3=Spencer |first3=DB |title=Effect of methotrexate upon choriocarcinoma |journal=Proc Soc Exp Biol Med |volume=93 |pages=361-366 |year=1956}}</ref> discovering that [[methotrexate]] alone could cure [[choriocarcinoma]] (1958), a germ-cell malignancy that originates in trophoblastic cells of the placenta.  In 1960 Wright et al produced remissions in [[mycosis fungoides]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=JC |last2= Gumport  |first2=SL |last3= Golomb  |first3=FM |title=Remissions produced with the use of methotrexate in patients with my- cosis fungoides. |journal=Cancer Chemother Rep |volume=9 |pages=11-20 |year=1960}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=JC |last2=Lyons |first2=M |last3=Walker |first3=DG |title=Observations on the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents in patients with mycosis fungoides |journal=Cancer |volume=17 |pages=1045-1062 |year=1964}}</ref>

==6-MP, vinca alkaloids and a national treatment effort by the US==
[[Joseph Burchenal]], at [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] in [[New York]], with Farber's help, started his own methotrexate study and found the same effects. He then decided to try to develop anti-metabolites in the same way as Farber, by making small changes in a metabolite needed by a cell to divide. With the help of [[George Hitchings]] and [[Gertrude Elion]], two pharmaceutical chemists who were working at the [[Burroughs Wellcome Co.]] in [[Tuckahoe, Westchester County, New York|Tuckahoe]], many [[purine]] analogues were tested, culminating in the discovery of [[6-mercaptopurine]] (6-MP), which was subsequently shown to be a highly active antileukemic drug.

The [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] natural products group found that [[alkaloid]]s of the [[Madagascar periwinkle]] (''Vinca rosea''), originally discovered in a screen for [[anti-diabetic drug]]s, blocked proliferation of tumour cells. The antitumour effect of the vinca alkaloids (e.g. [[vincristine]]) was later shown to be due to their ability to inhibit [[microtubule]] polymerization, and therefore cell division.

The [[United States Congress]] created a [[National Cancer Chemotherapy Service Center]] (NCCSC) at the NCI in 1955 in response to early successes. This was the first federal programme to promote drug discovery for cancer – unlike now, most pharmaceutical companies were not yet interested in developing anticancer drugs. The NCCSC developed the methodologies and crucial tools (like [[cell line]]s and [[animal model]]s) for chemotherapeutic development in the US.

==Combination chemotherapy==
In 1965, a major break-through in cancer therapy occurred. [[James Holland (medical doctor)|James Holland]], [[Emil Freireich]], and [[Emil Frei]] hypothesized that cancer chemotherapy should follow the strategy of antibiotic therapy for tuberculosis with combinations of drugs, each with a different mechanism of action. Cancer cells could conceivably mutate to become resistant to a single agent, but by using different drugs ''concurrently'' it would be more difficult for the tumor to develop resistance to the combination. Holland, Freireich, and Frei simultaneously administered [[methotrexate]] (an antifolate), [[vincristine]] (a Vinca alkaloid), 6-[[mercaptopurine]] (6-MP) and [[prednisone]] — together referred to as the POMP regimen — and induced long-term remissions in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). With incremental refinements of original regimens, using randomized clinical studies by [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]], the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] in the UK (UKALL protocols) and German [[Berlin]]-[[Frankfurt]]-[[Münster]] clinical trials group (ALL-BFM protocols), ALL in children has become a largely curable disease.

This approach was extended to the lymphomas in 1963 by [[Vincent T. DeVita]] and [[George Canellos]] at the NCI, who ultimately proved in the late 1960s that nitrogen mustard, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone — known as the [[MOPP (medicine)|MOPP regimen]] — could cure patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 

Currently, nearly all successful cancer [[chemotherapy regimens]] use this paradigm of multiple drugs given simultaneously.

==Adjuvant therapy==

As predicted by studies in animal models, drugs were most effective when used in patients with tumours of smaller volume. Another important strategy developed from this — if the tumour burden could be reduced first by surgery, then chemotherapy may be able to clear away any remaining malignant cells, even if it would not have been potent enough to destroy the tumor in its entirety. This approach was termed "adjuvant therapy".

[[Emil Frei]] first demonstrated this effect — high doses of methotrexate prevented recurrence of [[osteosarcoma]] following surgical removal of the primary tumour. [[5-fluorouracil]], an inhibitor of DNA synthesis, was later shown to improve survival when used as an adjuvant to surgery in treating patients with colon cancer. Similarly, the landmark trials of [[Bernard Fisher (scientist)|Bernard Fisher]], chair of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, and of [[Gianni Bonadonna]], working in the [[Istituto Nazionale Tumori di Milano]], [[Italy]], proved that [[adjuvant chemotherapy]] after complete surgical resection of breast tumours significantly extended survival — particularly in more advanced cancer.

==Drug Discovery at the NCI and elsewhere==
===Zubrod's initiatives===

In 1956, [[C. Gordon Zubrod]], who had formerly led the development of antimalarial agents for the United States Army, took over the Division of Cancer Treatment of the NCI and guided development of new drugs. In the two decades that followed the establishment of the NCCSC, a large network of cooperative clinical trial groups evolved under the auspices of the NCI to test anticancer agents. Zubrod had a particular interest in natural products, and established a broad programme for collecting and testing plant and marine sources, a controversial programme that led to the discovery of taxanes (in 1964) and camptothecins (in 1966). Both classes of drug were isolated and characterized by the laboratory of [[Monroe Wall]] at the [[Research Triangle Institute]].

===The taxanes===
[[Paclitaxel]] (Taxol) was a novel antimitotic agent that promoted [[microtubule]] assembly. This agent proved difficult to synthesize and could only be obtained from the bark of the [[Taxus brevifolia|Pacific Yew tree]], which forced the NCI into the costly business of harvesting substantial quantities of yew trees from public lands. After 4 years of clinical testing in solid tumours, it was found in 1987 (23 years after its initial discovery) to be effective in [[ovarian cancer]] therapy. Notably, this agent, although developed by the NCI in partnership with [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], was exclusively marketed by BMS (who had utilized the synthetic methodology developed by Robert Holton at Florida State University) who went on to make over a billion dollars profit from Taxol.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===The camptothecins===
Another drug class originating from the NCI was the camptothecins. [[Camptothecin]], derived from a Chinese ornamental tree, inhibits [[topoisomerase]] I, an enzyme that allows DNA unwinding. Despite showing promise in preclinical studies, the agent had little antitumour activity in early clinical trials, and dosing was limited by [[nephrotoxicity|kidney toxicity]]: its lactone ring is unstable at neutral pH, so while in the acidic environment of the kidneys it becomes active, damaging the renal tubules. In 1996 a more stable analogue, [[irinotecan]], won [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval for the treatment of colon cancer. Later, this agent would also be used to treat lung and ovarian cancers.

===Platinum-based agents===
[[Cisplatin]], a [[platinum]]-based compound, was discovered by a [[Michigan State University]] researcher, [[Barnett Rosenberg]], working under an NCI contract. This was yet another [[serendipity|serendipitous]] discovery: Rosenberg had initially wanted to explore the possible effects of an electric field on the growth of bacteria. He observed that the bacteria unexpectedly ceased to divide when placed in an electric field. Excited, he spent months of testing to try to explain this phenomenon. He was disappointed to find that the cause was an experimental [[Artifact (error)|artifact]] — the inhibition of bacterial division was pinpointed to an [[electrolysis]] product of the platinum [[electrode]] rather than the electrical field. This accidental discovery, however, soon initiated a series of investigations and studies into the effects of platinum compounds on cell division, culminating in the synthesis of cisplatin. This drug was pivotal in the cure of [[testicular cancer]]. Subsequently, [[Eve Wiltshaw]] and others at the [[Institute of Cancer Research]] in the [[United Kingdom]] extended the clinical usefulness of the platinum compounds with their development of [[carboplatin]], a cisplatin derivative with broad antitumour activity and comparatively less nephrotoxicity.

===Nitrosoureas===
A second group with an NCI contract, led by [[John Montgomery]] at the [[Southern Research Institute]], synthesized [[nitrosourea]]s, an alkylating agent which cross-links DNA. [[Fludarabine]] phosphate, a purine analogue which has become a mainstay in treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, was another similar development by Montgomery.

===Anthracyclines and epipodophyllotoxins===
Other effective molecules also came from industry during the period of 1970 to 1990, including [[anthracycline]]s and [[epipodophyllotoxin]]s — both of which inhibited the action of [[topoisomerase II]], an [[enzyme]] crucial for [[DNA]] synthesis.

==Supportive care during chemotherapy==
As is obvious from their origins, the above cancer chemotherapies are essentially [[poison]]s. Patients receiving these agents experienced severe side-effects that limited the doses which could be administered, and hence limited the beneficial effects. Clinical investigators realized that the ability to manage these toxicities was crucial to the success of cancer chemotherapy.

Several examples are noteworthy. Many chemotherapeutic agents cause profound suppression of the bone marrow. This is reversible, but takes time to recover. Support with [[platelet]] and red-cell transfusions as well as broad-spectrum [[antibiotic]]s in case of infection during this period is crucial to allow the patient to recover. 

Several practical factors are also worth mentioning. Most of these agents caused very severe nausea (termed [[chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting]] (CINV) in the literature) which, while not directly causing patient deaths, was unbearable at higher doses. The development of new drugs to prevent nausea (the prototype of which was [[ondansetron]]) was of great practical use, as was the design of indwelling intravenous catheters (e.g. [[Hickman line]]s and [[Peripherally inserted central catheter|PICC lines]]) which allowed safe administration of chemotherapy as well as supportive therapy.

==A period of quiet==
With the successes of combination chemotherapy and the discovery of many new agents, there was a feeling at this time{{when|date=December 2012}} that all cancers could be treated, if only one could administer the correct combination of drugs, at the correct doses and at the correct intervals.{{cn|date=December 2012}} A search continued, with the pharmaceutical industry screening for new compounds and clinical scientists performing elaborate clinical trials with ever more complex combinations and higher doses.

One important contribution during this period{{when|date=December 2012}} was the discovery of a means that allowed the administration of previously lethal doses of chemotherapy. The patient's [[bone marrow]] was first harvested, the [[chemotherapy]] administered, and the harvested marrow then returned to patient a few days later. This approach, termed [[autologous]] [[bone marrow transplantation]], was initially thought to be of benefit to a wide group of patients, including those with advanced [[breast cancer]]. However, rigorous studies have failed to confirm this benefit, and autologous transplantation is no longer widely used for solid tumors. The proven curative benefits of high doses of chemotherapy afforded by autologous bone marrow rescue are limited to both Hodgkin's and selected non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients who have failed therapy with conventional combination chemotherapy. Autologous transplantation continues to be used as a component of therapy for a number of other [[hematological malignancy|hematologic malignancies]].

The hormonal contribution to several categories of breast cancer subtypes was recognized during this time((when)), leading to the development of pharmacological modulators (e.g. of [[Estrogen|oestrogen]]) such as [[tamoxifen]].

Although clinical oncologists appeared to have hit a wall at this point{{when|date=December 2012}} in terms of results, progress was being made to understand the mechanisms underlying cancer. Understanding of the machinery of the cell and advances in techniques to probe perturbations in its function allowed researchers to understand the genetic nature of cancer. Previously chemotherapeutic agents had been discovered essentially by chance, or by inhibiting the metabolic pathways crucial to cell division, but none were particularly specific to the cancer cell.

==[[Targeted therapy]]==
[[File:Bcr abl STI 1IEP.png|thumb|350px|left|<em style="color:green;font-style:normal">bcr-abl kinase</em>, which causes [[Chronic myelogenous leukemia|CML]], inhibited by <em style="color:red;font-style:normal">imatinib</em> (small molecule).]]

Molecular and genetic approaches to understanding cell biology uncovered entirely new signalling networks that regulate cellular activities such as proliferation and survival. Many of these networks were found to be radically altered in cancer cells, and these alterations had a genetic basis caused by a chance somatic mutation.

===Tyrosine kinase inhibitors===
{{further2|[[Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors]]}}
The classic example of [[targeted therapy|targeted development]] is [[imatinib mesylate]] (Gleevec), a small molecule which inhibits a signaling molecule [[kinase]]. The genetic abnormality causing [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] (CML) has been known for a long time to be a [[chromosomal translocation]] creating an abnormal fusion protein, kinase BCR-ABL, which signals aberrantly, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of the leukemia cells. Imatinib precisely inhibits this kinase. Unlike so many other anti-cancer agents, this pharmaceutical was no accident. [[Brian Druker]], working in [[Oregon Health Science University]], had extensively researched the abnormal enzyme kinase in CML. He reasoned that precisely inhibiting this kinase with a drug would control the disease and have little effect on normal cells. Druker collaborated with [[Novartis]] chemist [[Nicholas Lydon]], who developed several candidate inhibitors. From these, [[imatinib]] was found to have the most promise in laboratory experiments. First Druker and then other groups worldwide demonstrated that when this small molecule is used to treat patients with chronic-phase CML, 90% achieve complete haematological remission. It is hoped that molecular targeting of similar defects in other cancers will have the same effect.

===Monoclonal antibodies===
Another branch in [[targeted therapy]] is the increasing use of [[Monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]] in cancer therapy. Although monoclonal antibodies (immune proteins which can be selected to precisely bind to almost any target) have been around for decades, they were derived from mice and did not function particularly well when administered to humans, causing allergic reactions and being rapidly removed from circulation. "[[Humanization]]" of these antibodies (genetically transforming them to be as similar to a human antibody as possible) has allowed the creation of a new family of highly effective humanized monoclonal antibodies. [[Trastuzumab]], a drug used to treat breast cancer, is a prime example.

==Effectiveness==
The discovery that certain toxic chemicals administered in combination can cure certain cancers ranks as one of the greatest in modern medicine. Childhood [[Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|ALL]], [[testicular cancer]], and [[Hodgkins disease]], previously universally fatal, are now generally curable diseases. Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has shown the ability to cure some cancers, including [[testicular cancer]], [[Hodgkin disease]], [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], and some [[leukemia]]s. It has also proved effective in the [[adjuvant]] setting, in reducing the risk of recurrence after surgery for high-risk [[breast cancer]], [[colon cancer]], and [[lung cancer]], among others.{{when|date=April 2013}} 

The overall impact of chemotherapy on cancer survival can be difficult to estimate, since improved cancer screening, prevention (e.g. anti-smoking campaigns), and detection all influence statistics on cancer incidence and mortality. In the [[United States]], overall cancer incidence rates were stable from 1995 through 1999, while cancer death rates decreased steadily from 1993 through 1999.<ref>{{cite book |author=Abeloff |title=Clinical Oncology |publisher=Churchill Livingston |year=2004 |edition=3rd |pages=408–413 }}</ref> Again, this likely reflects the combined impact of improved screening, prevention, and treatment. Nonetheless, cancer remains a major cause of illness and death, and conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has proved unable to cure most cancers after they have [[metastasis|metastasized]].
