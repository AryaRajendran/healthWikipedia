'''Savant syndrome''' is a condition in which a person with serious mental disabilities, including autistic disorder, demonstrates profound and [[child prodigy|prodigious]] capacities and/or abilities far in excess of what would be considered normal.<ref name=Treffert/><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9990844 |year=1999 |last1=Miller |first1=LK |title=The savant syndrome: Intellectual impairment and exceptional skill |volume=125 |issue=1 |pages=31–46 |journal=Psychological Bulletin |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.1.31}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2003.11.002 |title=Comparing the intelligence profiles of savant and nonsavant individuals with autistic disorder |year=2004 |last1=Bolte |first1=S |journal=Intelligence |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=121}}</ref> People with savant syndrome may have [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s, notably [[autism spectrum]] disorders and/or brain injuries.

==Characteristics==
According to psychiatrist [[Darold Treffert]], almost all savants have prodigious memory which he describes as "very deep, but exceedingly narrow". It is narrow in the sense that savants may exhibit [[Exceptional memory#Savants|exceptional memory]] but have difficulty putting it to use. Some individuals with savant syndrome also have keen sense of priority, which can involve a broad understanding of politics, law and a conceivably heightened vocabulary.  Savant skills are usually found in one or more of five major areas: art, musical abilities, calendar calculation, mathematics and spatial skills.<ref name=Treffert>{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0326 |title=The savant syndrome: An extraordinary condition.

==Mechanism==
Savant syndrome is poorly understood. No widely accepted cognitive theory explains savants' combination of talent and deficit.<ref name="Pring">{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0012162205000976 |title=Savant talent |year=2005 |last1=Pring |first1=Linda |journal=Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology |volume=47 |issue=7 |pages=500}}</ref> It has been suggested that  individuals with autism are biased towards detail-focused processing and that this cognitive style predisposes individuals either with or without autism to savant talents.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0332 |laysummary=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13489714 |laysource=The Economist |laydate=April 16, 2009 |pmc=2677590 |title=What aspects of autism predispose to talent? |year=2009 |last1=Happe |first1=F. |last2=Vital |first2=P. |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=364 |issue=1522 |pages=1369–1375 |pmid=19528019}}</ref> Another hypothesis is that savants hyper-systemize, thereby giving an impression of talent.

==Epidemiology==
There is no agreement about how many people have savant skills. The estimates range from "exceedingly rare"<ref name = Hiles>http://www.psy.dmu.ac.uk/drhiles/Savant%20Syndrome.htm{{full|date=January 2013}}</ref> to one in ten people with autism having savant skills in varying degrees.<ref name=Treffert/> A 2009 British study of 137 parents of autistic children found that 28% believe their offspring met the criteria for a savant skill, defined as a skill or power "at a level that would be unusual even for normal people".<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0328 |laysummary=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13489714 |laysource=The Economist |laydate=April 16, 2009 |pmc=2677586 |title=Savant skills in autism: Psychometric approaches and parental reports |year=2009 |last1=Howlin |first1=P. |last2=Goode |first2=S. |last3=Hutton |first3=J. |last4=Rutter |first4=M. |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=364 |issue=1522 |pages=1359–1367 |pmid=19528018}}</ref> As many as 50 cases of sudden or acquired savant syndrome have been reported.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://articles.philly.com/2012-08-20/news/33273378_1_brain-injury-owens-answers-car-crash/2|title=An artist is born after car crash|work= The Inquirer|location=Philadelphia|first=Monica|last=Yant-Kinney|date=2012-08-20|accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref>

==History==
The term ''idiot savant'' ([[French language|French]] for "learned [[idiot]]" or "knowledgeable idiot") was first used to describe the condition in 1887 by [[John Langdon Down]], who is known for his description of [[Down syndrome]]. The term "idiot savant" was later described as a misnomer because not all reported cases fit the definition of idiot, originally used for a person with a very severe [[mental retardation]]. The term ''autistic savant'' was also used as a diagnosis for this disorder. Like idiot savant, the term autistic savant also became looked at as a misnomer because only one-half of those who were diagnosed at the time with savant syndrome were autistic. Upon realization of the need for accuracy of diagnosis and dignity towards the individual, the term ''savant syndrome'' became widely accepted terminology.<ref name=Treffert/><ref name = Hiles />

==Society and culture==

===Prodigious savants===
{{See also|Historical figures sometimes considered autistic}}
A prodigious savant is someone with a skill level equivalent to or greater than that of a [[Child prodigy|prodigy]], regardless of any cognitive disability. The most common trait of prodigious savants is their seemingly limitless [[mnemonic]] skills, with many having [[Eidetic memory|eidetic or photographic memories]]. Prodigious savants are extremely rare, with fewer than one hundred noted in more than a century of literature on the subject. Treffert estimates that fewer than fifty or so such individuals are alive today.
