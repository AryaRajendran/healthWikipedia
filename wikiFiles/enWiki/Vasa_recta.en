:''For the intestinal structure, see [[Vasa recta (intestines)]]''
In the [[renal circulation|blood supply of the kidney]], the '''vasa recta renis''' (or '''straight arteries of kidney''', or '''straight arterioles of kidney''') form a series of straight capillaries (''recta'' is from the [[Latin language|Latin]] for "straight") in the [[renal medulla|medulla]]. They lie parallel to the loop of Henle.

These vessels branch off the [[efferent arteriole]]s of [[juxtamedullary nephron]]s (those [[nephron]]s closest to the medulla), enter the medulla, and surround the [[loop of Henle]].

==Histology==
On a slide, vasa recta can be distinguished from the tubules of the [[loop of Henle]] by the presence of blood.<ref>{{BUHistology|15802loa}}</ref>

==Function==
Each of the vasa recta has a hairpin turn in the medulla and carries blood at a very slow rate, two factors crucial in the maintenance of [[countercurrent exchange]] that prevent washout of the concentration gradients established in the renal medulla.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch08/7ch08p07}}</ref>

The maintenance of this concentration gradient is one of the components responsible for the kidney's ability to produce concentrated [[urine]].

On the descending portion of the vasa recta, NaCl and urea are reabsorbed into the blood, while water is secreted. On the ascending portion of the vasa recta, NaCl and urea are secreted into the interstitium, while water is reabsorbed.

==Nomenclature==
According to [[Terminologia Anatomica]], the term "vasa recta renis" is an alternate name for "arteriolae rectae renis", and a separate term, [[Straight venules of kidney|venulae rectae renis]], is used to identify the venous portion.

However, other sources consider "vasa recta renis" to refer to both the arterial and venous portions.<ref>{{BUHistology|15804loa}}</ref>

The "renis" is often omitted, but there do exist two other structures with the same name:
*  [[vasa recta (intestines)]] (in the [[ileum]] and [[jejunum]])<ref>{{NormanAnatomy|jejunumileum}}</ref>
* the straight portion of the [[seminiferous tubule]], though this is usually called the [[Tubuli seminiferi recti|tubuli recti]].

==Pathology==
The slow blood flow in vasa recta makes them a likely location of [[thrombosis]] in hypercoagulable states, or tissue loss<ref name="pmid10710555">{{cite journal |author=ter Maaten JC, Serné EH, van Eps WS, ter Wee PM, Donker AJ, Gans RO |title=Effects of insulin and atrial natriuretic peptide on renal tubular sodium handling in sickle cell disease |journal=Am.
