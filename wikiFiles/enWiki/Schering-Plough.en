'''Schering-Plough Corporation''' was a [[United States]]-based pharmaceutical company. It was founded in 1851 by [[Ernst Christian Friedrich Schering]] as [[Schering|Schering AG]] in [[Germany]]. In 1971, the Schering Corporation merged with Plough (founded by Memphis area entrepreneur Abe Plough in 1908 <ref name="TenCulture">[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1064 "Abe Plough (1892-1984)]," ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture,'' online.</ref>) to form Schering-Plough. On November 4, 2009 [[Merck & Co.]] merged with Schering-Plough with the new company taking the name of Merck & Co.

Schering-Plough manufactured several pharmaceutical [[Medication|drugs]], the most well-known of which were the [[allergy]] drugs [[Claritin]] and [[Clarinex]], an anti-[[cholesterol]] drug [[Vytorin]], and a [[brain tumor]] drug [[Temodar]]. These are now available from Merck & Co.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Merck US Prescription Products |publisher=Merck.com |url=http://www.merck.com/product/prescription-products/home.html |accessdate=November 10, 2010}}</ref>

Schering Plough also owned and operated the major [[foot]] care brand name [[Dr. Scholl's]] and the [[skin]] care line [[Coppertone]]. These also became a part of the new company.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Merck Consumer Products |publisher=Merck.com |url=http://www.merck.com/product/consumer-products/home.html |accessdate=November 10, 2010}}</ref>

{{As of|2005|alt=As of June 2005}}, Schering-Plough had 1.4% market share in the U.S., placing it seventeenth in the top twenty pharmaceutical corporations by sales compiled by [[IMS Health]].

Schering-Plough was a full member of the [[European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations]] (EFPIA),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.efpia.eu/content/default.asp?PageID=559&DocID=4883|title=The Pharmaceutical Industry in Figures - 2008 Edition |publisher=European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA)|pages=49|accessdate=2008-08-25}}</ref> a membership which is also maintained by the new Merck.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Trade Association Memberships |publisher=Merck.com |url=http://www.merck.com/about/views-and-positions/trade-association-memberships.html |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref>

== History ==
===Pharmaceuticals and consumer products===
Schering was founded in 1851 by [[Ernst Christian Friedrich Schering]] as [[Schering AG]] in [[Germany]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Following the entry of the [[United States]] into [[World War II]] in 1941, U.S. President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] ordered [[Schering|Schering AG]]'s U.S. assets be seized. These became the Schering Corporation. The company was placed under a government administratorship until 1952, when it was released and its assets sold to the private sector. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In 1957, Schering acquired White Laboratories.<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Schering-Plough_Corp.aspx</ref>

Plough, Incorporated was founded by the [[Memphis, Tennessee]] area entrepreneur Abe Plough (1892&ndash;1984) in 1908 [http://www.societyofentrepreneurs.com/hall_honor/plough.asp]. He borrowed $125 from his father to start the business at age sixteen. As a one man business, he mixed "Plough's Antiseptic Healing Oil," a "sure cure for any ill of man or beast," and sold it off a horse-drawn buggy.<ref name=TenCulture /> He grew the company through sound management and innovative strategies, with marketing genius.{{Citation needed|reason=Please give a source for this assertion.  It's not in keeping with neutral POV|date=June 2009}}

Plough's acquisitions included St Joseph's Aspirin for children,<ref name=TenCulture />  [[Maybelline]] cosmetics, and [[Coppertone girl|Coppertone]] skin care products. Plough also had a broadcasting division, operating radio stations in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]; [[Baltimore, Maryland]]; [[Boston, Massachusetts]]; [[Chicago, Illinois]]; and [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19840915&id=p3kUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xQIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7046,2499030 Toledo Blade September 15, 1984-Abe Plough (Obituary)]</ref>

In 1971, the Schering Corporation merged with Plough, Inc. At the time of the merger, Abe Plough became Chairman of the combined company.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/schering-plough-corp   Hoover's Profile: Schering-Plough Corporation]</ref>

In 2000, Schering Plough bought a new campus in [[Summit, New Jersey]] from [[Novartis]].  The company planned to make this location its second-largest corporate complex in the world after completion of its current $20 million renovation. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Schering-Plough was named one of the ''100 Best Companies for Working Mothers'' in 2004 and 2005 by ''Working Mothers'' magazine. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

On March 9, 2009 it was announced that Schering-Plough and Merck were to merge.  On November 4, 2009 Schering-Plough merged with [[Merck & Co.]] and through a [[reverse takeover|reverse merger]] Merck became a subsidiary of Schering-Plough, which renamed itself Merck.<ref>

===Animal health===
====Coopers Animal Health====
One of Schering-Plough's plants, in [[Upper Hutt, New Zealand]] was the largest single site for the production of veterinary [[vaccines]] in the world.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} This was primarily because [[New Zealand]]'s isolation has formed a natural [[quarantine]], leaving the country free of [[rabies]], [[foot and mouth]], [[scrapie]], [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]], and many other livestock diseases. It formerly had [[echinococcosis]], but this has been eradicated. The site was known locally as '''Coopers Animal Health,''' a trademark which was still in use by Schering-Plough in Australia, but not elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

====Intervet====
On 12 March 2007, Schering-Plough Corp. purchased  [[Organon International]], the drug unit of Netherlands-based Akzo Nobel, for $14.4 billion, giving the US pharmaceutical company an array of women's health products and numerous late-stage pipelines of experimental medicines.<ref name="Buy">{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/2007/11/20/32697.aspx|title=Schering-Plough Acquires Organon BioSciences|date=20 November 2007|publisher=Medical Net News|accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref>

'''[[Organon International|Organon]]''' itself was founded in 1923 by Dr. Saal van Zwanenberg, the president of Zwanenberg’s Slachterijen en Fabrieken. The company is housed at Zwanenberg’s premises in Oss, the Netherlands..<ref name="History">{{cite web|url=http://www.organon.com/about/facts/history/index.asp?year=1920 |title=Organon History 1920's|publisher=Organon|accessdate=19 June 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061209230507/http://www.organon.com/about/facts/history/index.asp?year=1920 |archivedate = 9 December 2006}}</ref> 
By August 21, 2008, Famvir ([[famciclovir]]) was marketed by Schering-Plough; formerly it was marketed by [[Novartis]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

As a result of the acquisition of Organon BioSciences, Schering-Plough bolstered its animal health business with the [[Akzo Nobel]] subsidiary Intervet, obtained control of the active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturer, [[Diosynth]] and gained access to human vaccine production through the subsidiary Nobilon. The three companies comprising Organon BioSciences were--Organon, Diosynth, and Intervet.<ref name="Buy"/> [[HomeAgain]] continues to use the Intervet name owned by Merck.

====Merck Animal Health, MSD Animal Health====

==Collaborative research==

In addition to internal research and development activities '''Schering-Plough''' was also involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects, with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of [[Pre-clinical development|non-clinical]] safety assessment was the [[InnoMed PredTox]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/978-1-60327-048-9_11}}</ref><ref name="InnoMed PredTox official project website">{{cite web|url=http://www.innomed-predtox.com/consortium/members/|title=InnoMed PredTox Member Organizations|accessdate=2008-08-25}}</ref>

==Controversy==
In 2004, Schering-Plough was accused of marketing gimmicks and payoffs to doctors for prescribing the company's pharmaceutical products.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/27/business/27DRUG.final.html?ex=1403668800&en=d74fd7b7eb933e39&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND   Gardiner Harris, "As Doctors Write Prescriptions, Drug Company Writes a Check", ''New York Times'' (June 27, 2004)]</ref>

Schering-Plough entered into a Consent Decree with the FDA on March 6, 2002 due to manufacturing issues with its albuterol inhaler. It was ordered to pay $500 Million US dollars to the US Treasury.
