Humans are hosts for two other lice as well — the [[body louse]] and the [[crab louse]].

Head-lice infestation is widely endemic, especially in children. It is a cause of some concern in public health, although, unlike human [[body lice]], head lice are not carriers of other infectious diseases. It has been suggested that in the past, head lice infection has been a mutualistic beneficial condition which helps to defend against the far more dangerous disease-carrying body louse.<ref name="mutualism">{{cite journal| last =Rozsa | first =Lajos | coauthors =Apari P. | title =[http://www.zoologia.hu/list/Why_infest.pdf Why infest the loved ones – inherent human behaviour indicates former mutualism with head lice]| journal =Parasitology | volume = | pages =''in press'' | year =2012}} On-line full text available at link</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Headlice.jpg|thumb|right|Adult male (left) and female (right) head lice]]
The most common symptom of infestation is [[pruritus]] (itching) on the head which normally intensifies 3 to 4 weeks after the initial infestation{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. The bite reaction is very mild and it can be rarely seen between the hairs. Bites can be seen, especially in the neck of long-haired individuals when the hair is pushed aside. In rare cases, the itch scratch cycle can lead to secondary infection with [[impetigo]] and [[pyoderma]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. Swelling of the local [[lymph nodes]] and fever are rare. Head lice are not known to transmit any pathogenic microorganisms.

==Cause==
Head lice are generally spread through direct head-to-head contact with an infested person; transmission by sharing bedding or clothing such as headwear is much less common.<ref name=cdc>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/lice/head/factsheet.html |title=Head lice fact sheet |author=Division of Parasitic Diseases (DPD), National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and Enteric Diseases (ZVED) |date=May 16, 2008 |work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website |publisher=Department of Health and Human Services, US Government|location=Atlanta, GA |accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref> Body lice are spread through direct contact with the body, clothing or other personal items of a person already carrying lice. Pubic lice are most often spread by intimate contact with an infested person. Head lice occur on the head hair, body lice on the clothing, and pubic lice mainly on the hair near the groin. Human lice do not occur on pets or other animals{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. Lice do not have wings and cannot jump{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.

From each egg or "nit" may hatch one nymph that will grow and develop to the adult louse{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. Full-grown lice are found to be the size of a sesame seed. Lice feed on blood 1-8 times each day by piercing the skin with their tiny needle-like mouthparts{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. Lice cannot burrow into the skin.

Head lice and body lice (''[[Pediculus humanus]]'') are similar in appearance, although the head lice is often smaller.<ref name="Bacot1917">{{cite journal

===Vectorial capacity===
[[Head lice]] (''Pediculus humanus capitis'') are not known to be vectors of diseases, unlike body lice (''Pediculus humanus humanus''), which are known vectors of epidemic or [[louse-borne typhus]] (''Rickettsia prowazeki''), [[trench fever]] (''Rochalimaea quintana'') and [[louse-borne relapsing fever]] (''Borrellia recurrentis''){{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Bugbuster.jpg|right|thumb|Lice comb (Bug Buster) wet combing with conditioner for diagnosis and treatment. Head lice can be seen in foam.]]
The condition is diagnosed by the presence of lice or eggs in the hair, which is facilitated by using a magnifying glass or running a comb through the child's hair. In questionable cases, a child can be referred to a health professional. However, the condition is overdiagnosed, with extinct infestations being mistaken for active ones. As a result, lice-killing treatments are more often used on noninfested than infested children.<ref name="Pollack2000">{{cite journal | author = Pollack RJ, Kiszewski AE, Spielman A | title = Overdiagnosis and consequent mismanagement of head louse infestations in North America | journal = The Pediatric Infectious Diseases Journal | volume = 19  | issue = 8 | pages = 689–93 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10959734 | doi=10.1097/00006454-200008000-00003}}</ref> The use of a louse comb is the most effective way to detect living lice.<ref name="Mumcuoglu2001">{{cite journal

With both methods, special attention should be paid to the area near the ears and the nape of the neck. The examiner should examine the scalp for at least 5 minutes{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. The use of a magnifying glass to examine the material collected between the teeth of the comb could prevent misdiagnosis.

The presence of nits alone, however, is not an accurate indicator of an active head louse infestation. Children with nits on their hair have a 35-40% chance of also being infested with living lice and eggs.<ref name="Mumcuoglu2001"/><ref name="pmid11331679">{{cite journal |author=Williams LK, Reichert A, MacKenzie WR, Hightower AW, Blake PA |title=Lice, nits, and school policy |journal=Pediatrics |volume=107 |issue=5 |pages=1011–5 |year=2001 |pmid=11331679 |doi=10.1542/peds.107.5.1011}}</ref> If lice are detected, the entire family needs to be checked (especially children up to the age of 13 years) with a louse comb, and only those who are infested with living lice should be treated.
As long as no living lice are detected, the child should be considered negative for head louse infestation. Accordingly, a child should be treated with a pediculicide ONLY when living lice are detected on his/her hair (not because he/she has louse eggs/nits on the hair and not because the scalp is itchy).<ref name=JDD/>

==Prevention==
[[File:Dont Let Lice Make A Monkey Out Of You.gif|right|thumb|World War II-era American poster, created to prevent outbreaks of pediculosis among servicemen.]]
Examination of the child’s head at regular intervals using a louse comb allows the diagnosis of louse infestation at an early stage. Early diagnosis makes treatment easier and reduces the possibility of infesting others. In times and areas when louse infestations are common, weekly examinations of children, especially those 4–15 yrs old, carried out by their parents will aid control. Additional examinations are necessary if the child came in contact with infested individuals, if the child frequently scratches his/her head, or if nits suddenly appear on the child’s hair. Keeping long hair tidy could be helpful in the prevention of infestations with head lice.

Clothes, towels, bedding, combs and brushes, which came in contact with the infested individual, can be disinfected either by leaving them outside for at least 2 weeks or by washing them at 60°C(140 degrees F) for 30 minutes.<ref>[http://kidshealth.org/parent/infections/common/head_lice.html Kidshealth.org - Head lice, page-3]</ref>  This is because adult lice can survive only one to two days without a blood meal, and are highly dependent on human body warmth.<ref>[http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/human_lice.htm University of Florida Dept of Entomology Circular 175]</ref>  An insecticidal treatment of the house and furniture is not necessary.

==Treatment==
{{Main|Treatment of human head lice}}
Except for recent studies on neem seed extract,<ref>http://www.springerlink.com/content/x205175700451226/</ref> there is no product or method which assures 100% destruction of the eggs and hatched lice after a single treatment. However, there are a number of treatment modalities that can be employed with varying degrees of success. These methods include chemical treatments, natural products, combs, shaving, hot air,<ref name="Pediatrics">{{cite journal| last =Goates BM et al.| first1 =BM| last2 =Atkin| first2 =JS| last3 =Wilding| first3 =KG| last4 =Birch| first4 =KG| last5 =Cottam| first5 =MR| last6 =Bush| first6 =SE| last7 =Clayton| first7 =DH| title =An Effective Nonchemical Treatment for Head Lice: A Lot of Hot Air| journal =[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] | volume =118 | issue =5 | pages =1962–1970 | publisher =[[American Academy of Pediatrics]] | date =5 November 2006 | url =http://www.zoologia.hu/pediatrics.pdf | accessdate =2010-08-02| doi =10.1542/peds.2005-1847| pmid =17079567 }}</ref> and silicone-based lotions<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=2652450 |title=The mode of action of dimeticone 4% lotion against head lice, Pediculus capitis |author=Ian F Burgess, Medical Entomology Centre, Insect Research & Development Limited | pmid=19232080 |doi=10.1186/1471-2210-9-3 |volume=9 |year=2009 |journal=BMC Pharmacol. |pages=3}}</ref> however all effective treatments require a two-fold process of killing both the adult lice and the eggs. Generally the eggs (nits) need to be manually picked off one by one in order to ensure all live eggs are removed. 

Lice on the hair and body are usually treated with medicated shampoos or cream rinses. Nit combs can be used to remove lice and nits from the hair. Laundering clothes using high heat can eliminate body lice. Efforts to treat should focus on the hair or body (or clothes), and not on the home environment{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.

Some lice have become resistant to certain (but not all) insecticides used in commercially available anti-louse products. A physician or pharmacist can prescribe or suggest treatments. Empty eggs of head lice may remain attached to the hair shaft long after the lice have been eliminated{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, but rarely are adult lice seen even with an active infestation. Since there is no way to determine whether each egg is alive or dead,  chemical treatment (which may not kill the eggs) should be considered only when live (crawling) lice are discovered in order to kill the adults. Instead, nitpicking, which is checking each hair strand for eggs and picking off each egg, should be used to prevent the possibility of an egg hatching resulting in reinfestation.

[[Tea Tree Oil]] is one of the few natural ingredients that have been proven to be effective in laboratory tests.<ref>http://www.springerlink.com/content/d320k5rn36875835/</ref> Other home remedies such as putting vinegar, isopropyl alcohol, olive oil, mayonnaise, or melted butter under a shower cap have been disproven.<ref>http://www.pediatricnursing.org/article/S0882-5963(04)00139-3/abstract</ref> Similarly, the CDC claims that swimming has no effect on treating lice, and can in fact harm the treatment by commercial products.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/faq/#get_lice</ref>

School head lice policy involves a number of issues:
*Establishing criteria to infer infestation
*Screening asymptomatic children for evidence of infestation
*Establishing the circumstances under which children will be inspected
*Immediate exclusion of infested children
*Establishing criteria to permit previously infested children to return to school (e.g., the no-nit policy)

This has led to the perception that the no-nit policy serves only to ease the workload of school nurses and punish the parents of infested children.<ref name="Mumcuoglu2006"/>

Proponents of the no-nit policy counter that only a consistently nit-free child can be reliably shown to be infestation-free.<ref name="NPA">{{cite web
