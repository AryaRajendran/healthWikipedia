'''Body odor''' is present both in animals and humans and its intensity can be influenced by many factors (behavioral patterns, survival strategies). Body odor has a strong genetic basis both in animals and humans, but it can be also strongly influenced by various diseases and psychological conditions.

== Causes ==
In humans, the formation of body odors is mainly caused by [[skin gland]]s excretions and  bacterial activity.<ref name=lund-4>{{cite book |last=Lundström |first=Johan N. |last2=Olsson |first2=Mats J. |title=Pheromones |year=2010 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-381516-3 |chapter=Functional Neuronal Processing of Human Body Odors|page=4}}</ref> Between the different types of skin glands, the human body odor is primarily the result of the [[apocrine sweat gland]]s, which secrete the majority of chemical compounds needed for the [[skin flora]] to metabolize it into odorant substances.<ref name=lund-4/> This happens mostly in the axillary (armpit) region, although the gland can also be found in the [[areola]], anogenital region, and around the [[navel]].<ref>{{cite book| last=Turkington| first=Carol| last2=Dover| first2=Jeffrey S.| title=The encyclopedia of skin and skin disorders| year=2007| publisher=Facts on File|location=New York| isbn=978-0-8160-6403-8| pages=363| edition=3rd}}</ref> In humans the [[armpit]] regions seem more important than the genital region for body odor which may be related to human [[bipedalism]]. The genital and armpit regions also contain springy hairs which help diffuse body odors.<ref name=Oxford2007/>

Body odor is influenced by the actions of the [[skin flora]], including members of ''[[Corynebacterium]]'', which manufacture enzymes called [[lipases]] that break down the lipids in sweat to create smaller molecules like [[butyric acid]]. These smaller molecules smell, and give body odor its characteristic aroma.<ref>Buckman, Dr. Robert (2003). Human Wildlife: The Life That Lives On Us. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 93-4</ref> [[Propionic acid]] (propanoic acid) is present in many sweat samples. This acid is a breakdown product of some [[amino acid]]s by [[propionibacteria]], which thrive in the ducts of adolescent and adult [[sebaceous]] glands. Because propionic acid is chemically similar to [[acetic acid]] with similar characteristics including odor, body odors may be identified as having a vinegar-like smell by certain people.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} [[Isovaleric acid]] (3-methyl butanoic acid) is the other source of body odor as a result of actions of the bacteria ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'',<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ara K |title=Foot odor due to microbial metabolism and its control |journal=Can.

Factors such as food, drink, and diseases can affect body odor.<ref name=Oxford2007/> An individual's body odor is also influenced by [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], [[gender]], [[genetics]], and [[medication]].

==Function==
{{See also|Pheromone}}
===Animals===
In many animals body odor plays an important survival function. Strong body odor can be a [[warning signal]] for predators to stay away, or it can be also a signal that the prey animal is [[unpalatable]].<ref>Ruxton, Graeme D., Thomas N. Sherratt, and Michael P. Speed. 2004. Avoiding attack. The evolutionary ecology of crypsis, warning signals, and mimicry. Oxford University Press</ref> For example, some animals species, who feign death to survive (like [[possum]]s), in this state produce a strong body odor to deceive a predator that the prey animal has been dead for a long time and is already in the advanced stage of decomposing. Some animals with strong body odor are rarely attacked by most of the predators, although they can be still killed and eaten by the birds of prey, who have very poor sense of smell.

Body odor is an important feature of animal morphology. It plays a different role in different animal species. For example, in some predator species, who use stalking as a means of hunt (for example big and small [[cats]]), the absence of body odor is highly important, and they spend plenty of time and energy to keep their body free of odor. For other predators, who use long running after the prey as a means of hunting ([[dog]]s, [[Gray wolf|wolves]]), the absence of body odor is not so important, on the contrary, can play a role of warning signal. In most of the animals body odor intensifies in the moment of stress and danger.

===Humans===
Sebaceous and apocrine glands become active at [[puberty]]. This, as well as many apocrine glands being close to the sex organs, points to a role related to mating.<ref name=Oxford2007/> Compared to other primates, humans have extensive axillary hair and have many odor producing sources, in particular many apocrine glands.<ref name=AEP/> In women, the sense of olfaction is strongest around the time of [[ovulation]], significantly stronger than during other phases of the [[menstrual cycle]] and also stronger than the sense in males.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Navarrete-Palacios E, Hudson R, Reyes-Guerrero G, Guevara-Guzmán R |title=Lower olfactory threshold during the ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle |journal=Biological Psychology |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=269–79 |year=2003 |month=July |pmid=12853171 |doi=10.1016/S0301-0511(03)00076-0 |url=}}</ref>

Humans can detect individuals that are blood-related kin (mothers and children but not husbands and wives) from olfaction.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0031-9384(85)90210-0 | author = Porter RH, Cernoch JM, Balogh RD | year = 1985 | title = Odor signatures and kin recognition | url = | journal = Physiol Behav | volume = 34 | issue = 3| pages = 445–8 | pmid = 4011726 }}</ref> Mothers can identify by body odor their biological children but not their stepchildren. Preadolescent children can olfactorily detect  their full siblings but not half-siblings or step siblings and this might explain incest avoidance and the [[Westermarck effect]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12810039 | volume=85 | issue=3 | journal = Journal of experimental child psychology | year=2003 | title = Possible olfaction-based mechanisms in human kin recognition and inbreeding avoidance. | month=July | pages=279–95 | author=Weisfeld GE, Czilli T, Phillips KA, Gall JA, Lichtman CM | doi=10.1016/S0022-0965(03)00061-4}}</ref> Babies can recognize their mothers by smell and mothers and other relatives can identify a baby by smell.<ref name=Oxford2007/> 

Humans have few olfactory receptor cells compared to dogs and few functional olfactory receptor genes compared to rats. This is in part due a reduction of the size of the snout in order to achieve [[depth perception]] as well as other changes related to bipedalism. However, it has been argued that humans may have larger brain areas associated with olfactory perception compared to other species.<ref name=AEP>S. Craig Roberts and Jan Havlicek. "Evolutionary psychology and perfume design". In {{cite doi|10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001}}</ref>

[[Joseph Jordania]] has suggested that human body odor played a role of [[aposematic]] [[olfactory]] (warning display signal) in early hominids, particularly at night, when hominids were sleeping in the open savannah. As many predators approach their prey against the wind, the strong body odor would inform predators about the identity and the size of the hominid group. He explained the presence of patches of hair in human armpits and genitals by the evolutionary need to produce stronger body odor. According to his suggestion, body odor lost its survival value after humans developed more advanced means of safety (controlled fire, shelters, effective weapons), and therefore started disappearing, gradually becoming an unwanted legacy of our evolutionary past.<ref>[[Joseph Jordania|Jordania, Joseph]]. [[Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution]]. Logos, 2011:123-124</ref>

Studies have suggested that people might be using odor cues associated with the immune system to select mates. Using a brain imaging technique, Swedish researchers have shown that [[homosexuality|homosexual]] and [[heterosexuality|straight]] males' brains respond differently to two odors that may be involved in sexual arousal, and that homosexual men respond in the same way as straight women, though it could not be determined whether this was cause or effect. The study was expanded to include lesbian women; the results were consistent with previous findings meaning that lesbian women were not as responsive to male identified odors, while their response to female cues was similar to straight males.<ref>Savic, I."[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0600331103v1?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=ivanka&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&resourcetype=HWCIT Brain response to putative pheromones in lesbian women]." PNAS, May 16, 2006</ref>  According to the researchers, this research suggests a possible role for human pheromones in the biological basis of [[sexual orientation]].<ref>Wade, N. "[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/science/09cnd-smell.html Homosexual Men are found to have Different Scent of Attraction]." NY Times, May 9, 2005</ref>

Several different odorous substances released by the body cause behavioral effects as described in the [[pheromone]] article.

==Genetics==
{{See also|Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection|Body odor and subconscious human sexual attraction}}

Body odor is largely influenced by [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) molecules. These are genetically determined and play an important role in [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] of the organism. The [[vomeronasal organ]] contains cells sensitive to MHC molecules in a genotype-specific way. 

Experiments on animals and volunteers have shown that potential sexual partners tend to be perceived more attractive if their MHC composition is substantially different. Married couples are more different regarding MHC genes than would be expected by chance. This behavior pattern promotes variability of the immune system of individuals in the population, thus making the population more robust against new diseases. Another reason may be to prevent [[inbreeding]].<ref name=Oxford2007>The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 22 Body odours and body odour preferences in humans by Claus Wedekind</ref>

East Asians ([[Koreans]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], and [[Japanese people|Japanese]]) have fewer [[apocrine sweat glands]] compared to people of other descent, and the lack of these glands make East Asians less prone to body odor.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sherrow |first=Victoria |title=For appearance' sake: The historical encyclopedia of good looks, beauty, and grooming |year=2001 |publisher=Oryx Press |location=Phoenix |isbn=978-1-57356-204-1 |page=58}}</ref><ref name=stoddm>{{cite book |last=Stoddart |first=D.

==Alterations==

Body odor may be reduced or prevented or even aggravated by using [[deodorant]]s, [[antiperspirant]]s, [[disinfectant]]s, [[underarm liners]], [[triclosan]], special soaps or foams with antiseptic plant extracts such as [[ribwort]] and [[liquorice]], [[chlorophyllin]] ointments and sprays topically, and chlorophyllin supplements internally.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/phytochemicals/chlorophylls/ |title=Chlorophyll and Chlorophyllin |accessdate=2010-01-29 |work=}}</ref> Although body odor is commonly associated with [[hygiene]] practices, its presentation can be affected by changes in [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] as well as the other factors discussed above.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mdhealthnetwork.org/BodyOder.html |title=Learn How to Fight Body Odor |accessdate=2007-07-05 |work=}}</ref>

==Medical conditions==
The condition can be known medically as bromhidrosis, apocrine bromhidrosis, osmidrosis, ozochrotia, fetid sweat, body smell or malodorous sweating.<ref>James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''. (10th ed.). Saunders. p. 779. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref><ref>Freedberg, et al. (2003). ''Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine''. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. p. 707. ISBN 0-07-138076-0.</ref>

Osmidrosis or bromhidrosis is defined by a foul odor due to a water-rich environment that supports bacteria, which is caused by an abnormal increase in perspiration ([[hyperhidrosis]]).<ref name=kanlay/> This can be particularly strong when it happens in the axillary region (underarms). In this case, the condition may be referred to a axillary osmidrosis.<ref name=kanlay/>
