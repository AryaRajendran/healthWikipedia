A '''myxoid cyst''' (also known as a '''synovial cyst''' or '''mucous cyst''') is a [[ganglion]] (tissue mass) of the adjacent joint, caused by leakage of fluid from the joint into the surrounding tissue.<ref name="lawrence">{{cite journal |author=Lawrence C |title=Skin excision and osteophyte removal is not required in the surgical treatment of digital myxoid cysts |journal=[[Archives of dermatology]] |volume=141 |issue=12 |pages=1560â€“4 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16365258 |doi=10.1001/archderm.141.12.1560 |url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16365258 |issn= |accessdate=2008-10-13}}</ref> These cysts often appear clinically with [[osteoarthritis|osteoarthritic]] symptoms and are a red or bluish colour, producing a gelatinous material if punctured.<ref name="burkhart">{{cite journal |author=Burkhart CG |title=Stabilize the joint associated with myxoid cyst prior to surgical procedure |journal=Dermatology online journal |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=9 |year=2005 |pmid=16409905 |doi= |url=http://dermatology.cdlib.org/113/pearls/myxoid/burkhart.html |issn= |accessdate=2008-10-13}}</ref> 

The cyst can be linked to the joint by injection of [[methylene blue]]; however, more recently, surgical techniques have been developed.<ref name="lawrence"/> Common treatments consist of injection of [[corticosteroid]]s, repeated puncture and drainage of the cyst or surgical excision. Total immobilization may lead to fixation of the joint and is not advised.<ref name="burkhart"/>
