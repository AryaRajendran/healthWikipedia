'''Hemolytic-uremic syndrome''' (or '''haemolytic-uraemic syndrome'''), abbreviated '''HUS''', is a disease characterized by [[hemolytic anemia]] (anemia caused by destruction of red blood cells), [[acute renal failure|acute kidney failure]] ([[uremia]]), and a low [[platelet]] count ([[thrombocytopenia]]). It predominantly, but not exclusively, affects children. Most cases are preceded by an episode of infectious, sometimes bloody, [[diarrhea]] caused by [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''E. coli'' O157:H7]], which is acquired as a [[foodborne illness]] or from a contaminated water supply. It is a [[medical emergency]] and carries a 5–10% mortality; of the remainder, the majority recover without major consequences but a small proportion develop [[chronic kidney disease]] and become reliant on [[renal replacement therapy]].<ref name="pmid11691946">{{cite journal |author=Corrigan JJ, Boineau FG |title=Hemolytic-uremic syndrome |journal=Pediatr Rev |volume=22 |issue=11 |pages=365–9 |year=2001 |month=November |pmid=11691946 |doi=}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
STEC-HUS occurs after ingestion of a strain of bacteria, usually types of [[E. coli]], that expresses [[verotoxin]] (also called [[Shiga-like toxin]]). Bloody [[diarrhea]] typically follows. HUS develops about 5–10 days after onset of diarrhea, with decreased urine output ([[oliguria]]), blood in the urine ([[hematuria]]), [[kidney failure]], [[thrombocytopenia]] (low levels of [[platelets]], cells in the blood that aid in clotting ) and destruction of red blood cells ([[microangiopathic hemolytic anemia]]). [[Hypertension]] is common.

==Pathogenesis==
HUS is one of the [[thrombotic microangiopathies]], a category of disorders that includes STEC-HUS, aHUS, and [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]] (TTP). STEC-HUS is usually preceded by a prodrome of diarrhea, which is often bloody, and is caused by Shiga-like toxin-producing bacteria such as enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), of which E. coli O157:H7 is the most common serotype.<ref name=Palermo2009>{{cite journal|last=Palermo, Exeni, Fernandez|first=MS, RA, GC|title=Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome: pathogenesis and update of interventions|journal=Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther|year=2009|volume=7|issue=6|pages=697–707}}</ref> Other serotypes also cause disease and can emerge as new causes of STEC-HUS, as occurred with E. coli O104:H4, which triggered a 2011 epidemic of STEC-HUS in Germany.<ref name=Robert>{{cite web|last=Robert Koch Institute|title=Technical Report: EHEC/HUS O104:H4 Outbreak, Germany, May/June 2011|url=http://www.rki.de/EN/Home/EHEC_Report.pdf?__blob=publicationFile.|publisher=Robert Koch Institute|location=Berlin, Germany}}</ref>

The typical pathophysiology of HUS involves the binding of Shiga-toxin to the globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) receptor on the surface of the glomerular endothelium.<ref name=Psotka2009>{{cite journal|last=Psotka, Obata, Kolling|first=MA, F, GL, et al.|title=Shiga toxin 2 targets the murine renal collecting duct epithelium|journal=Infect Immun|year=2009|volume=77|issue=3|pages=959–969}}</ref> This action includes a cascade of signaling events leading to [[apoptosis]] and binding of [[leukocytes]] to endothelial cells. The Shiga-toxin-activated endothelial cells then become [[thrombogenic]] (clot-producing) by mechanism that is not fully understood,<ref name=Zoja2010>{{cite journal|last=Zoja, Buelli, Morigi|first=C, S, M|title=Shoga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome: pathophysiology of endothelial dysfunction|journal=Pediatr Nephrol|year=2010|volume=25|issue=11|pages=2231–2240}}</ref> though they have been shown to induce the release of [[cytokines]] and [[chemokines]] that are implicated in platelet activation.<ref name=Guessous2005>{{cite journal|last=Guessous, Marcinkiewicz, Polanowska-Grabowska|first=F, M, R, et al.|title=Shiga toxin 2 and lipopolysaccharide induce human microvascular endothelial cells to release chemokines and factor that stimulate platelet function|journal=Infect Immun|year=2005|volume=73|issue=12|pages=8306–8316}}</ref> Additionally, the binding action of Shiga-toxin inactivates a [[metalloproteinase]] called [[ADAMTS13]], the deficiency of which causes the closely related TTP. Once ADAMTS13 is disabled, multimers of [[von Willebrand Factor]] (vWF) form and initiate platelet activation, causing microthrombi formation. The activation of platelets resulting from inhibition of ADAMTS13 is due to the hyperactivity of large multimers of uncleaved vWF. The [[arterioles]] and [[capillaries]] of the body become obstructed by the resulting complexes of activated [[platelets]], which have adhered to the endothelium via large multimeric vWF. Through a mechanism known as [[microangiopathic hemolysis]], the growing thrombi lodged in smaller vessels destroy [[red blood cells]] (RBCs) as they squeeze through the narrowed blood vessels, forming [[schistocytes]], or fragments of sheared RBCs.<ref name=Tsai2010 /> The presence of schistocytes is a key finding that helps to diagnose HUS. Typically, this hemolysis results in a hemoglobin level of less than 80&nbsp;mg/L.

Shiga-toxin directly activates the alternative complement pathway and also interferes with complement regulation by binding to complement factor H, an inhibitor of the complement cascade.  Shiga-toxin causes complement-mediated platelet, leukocyte, and endothelial cell activation, resulting in systemic hemolysis, inflammation and thrombosis.<ref name=Orth2010>{{cite journal|last=Orth, Wurzner|first=D, R|title=Complement in typical hemolytic uremic syndrome|journal=Semin thromb Hemost|year=2010|volume=36|issue=3|pages=620–624}}</ref><ref name=Stahl2011>{{cite journal|last=Stahl, Startz, Karpman|first=AL, L, D|title=Complement activation on platelet-leukocyte complexes and microparticles in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome|journal=Blood|year=2011|volume=117|issue=20|pages=5503–5513}}</ref><ref name=Thurman2009>{{cite journal|last=Thurman, Marians, Emlen|first=JM, R, W, et al|title=Alternative pathway of complement in children with diarrhea-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome|journal=Clin J Am Soc Nephrol|year=2009|volume=4|pages=1920–1924}}</ref> Severe clinical complications of TMA have been reported in patients from 2 weeks to more than 44 days after presentation with STEC-HUS, with improvements in clinical condition extending beyond this time frame, suggesting that complement activation persists beyond the acute clinical presentation and for at least 4 months.<ref name=Mache2010>{{cite journal|last=Mache, Otto, Gross|first=C, R, B, et al|title=Eculizumab in diarrhea-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome|journal=Presented at the 2nd International Conference on HUS-MPGN-PNH|year=2010|month=June|location=Innsbruck, Austria}}</ref>

The consumption of platelets as they adhere to the thrombi lodged in the small vessels typically leads to mild or moderate thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of less than 60,000 per mL.<ref name=Tan2011>{{cite web|last=Tan|first=AJ|title=Hemolytic uremic syndrome in emergency medicine|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/779218|work=Medscape eMedicine}}</ref> As in the related condition TTP, reduced blood flow through the narrowed blood vessels of the [[microvasculature]] leads to reduced blood flow to vital organs, and [[ischemia]] may develop.<ref name=Boyer2011 /> The [[kidneys]] and the [[central nervous system]] (brain and spinal cord) are the parts of the body most critically dependent on high blood flow, and are thus the most likely organs to be affected. However, in comparison to TTP, the kidneys tend to be more severely affected in HUS, and the central nervous system is less commonly affected.<ref name=Kanso2008>{{cite journal|last=Kanso, Abou Hassan, Badr|first=AA, NM, KF|title=Micro and macrovascular disease of the kidney|journal=In: Brenner BM, ed. The Kidney, 8th edition|year=2008|pages=chapter 32|publisher=Saunders Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA}}</ref>

In contrast with typical [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] seen with other causes of [[septicemia]] and occasionally with advanced cancer, [[coagulation factors]] are not consumed in HUS (or TTP) and the [[coagulation screen]], [[fibrinogen]] level, and assays for [[fibrin degradation products]] such as "D-Dimers", are generally normal despite the low platelet count (thrombocytopenia).<ref name=Kanso2008 />

[[Histologically]], the [[glomeruli]] show thickened and sometimes split capillary walls due largely to endothelial swelling. Large deposits of fibrin-related materials in the capillary lumens, subendothelially, and in the [[mesangium]] are also found along with mesangiolysis. Interlobular and afferent arterioles show fibrinoid necrosis and intimal [[hyperplasia]] and are often occluded by thrombi.<ref name=Kumar2002 />

STEC-HUS most often affects infants and young children, but also occurs in adults. The most common form of transmission is ingestion of undercooked meat, unpasteurized fruits and juices, contaminated produce, contact with unchlorinated water, and person-to-person transmission in daycare or long-term care facilities.<ref name=Noris2005 />

Unlike typical HUS, aHUS does not follow STEC infection and is thought to result from one or several genetic mutations that cause chronic, uncontrolled, and excessive activation of complement.<ref name=Noris2009 /> This leads to [[platelet]] activation, [[endothelial cell]] damage, and white blood cell activation, leading to systemic TMA, which manifests as decreased platelet count, [[hemolysis]], damage to multiple organs, and ultimately, death.<ref name=Benz2010 /><ref name=Sellier2007 /><ref name=Tsai2010 /> Early signs of systemic complement-mediated TMA include [[thrombocytopenia]] (platelet count below 150,000 or a decrease from baseline of at least 25%)<ref name=Caprioli2006 />  and evidence of [[microangiopathic]] hemolysis, which is characterized by elevated LDH levels, decreased haptoglobin, decreased [[hemoglobin]], and/or the presence of schistocytes.<ref name=Benz2010 /><ref name=Zipfel2010 /><ref name=Caprioli2006 />

Treatment of HUS is generally supportive, with [[dialysis]] as needed. [[Platelet]] [[blood transfusion|transfusion]] may actually worsen the outcome.

In most children with postdiarrheal HUS, there is a good chance of spontaneous resolution, so observation in a hospital is often all that is necessary, with supportive care such as [[hemodialysis]] where indicated. If a diagnosis of STEC-HUS is confirmed, [[plasmapheresis]] (plasma exchange) is contraindicated. However, plasmapheresis may be indicated when there is diagnostic uncertainty between HUS and TTP. 

There are case reports of experimental treatments with [[eculizumab]], a [[monoclonal antibody]] that blocks part of the [[complement system]],  being used to treat congenital atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gruppo RA, Rother RP.   | title = Eculizumab for congenital atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome. | journal = [[New England Journal of Medicine|N Engl J Med]] | volume = 360 | issue = | pages = 544–546 | year = 2009 | pmid = | doi = 10.1056/NEJMc0809959|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc0809959}}</ref> as well as severe shiga-toxin associated hemolytic uremic syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lapeyraque, et al   | title = Eculizumab in Severe Shiga-Toxin–Associated HUS | journal = [[New England Journal of Medicine|N Engl J Med]] | volume = 364 | issue = | pages = 2561–2563 | year = 2011 | pmid = | doi = 10.1056/NEJMc1100859|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1100859}}</ref> These have shown promising results. Eculizumab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)on March 13, 2007 for the treatment of [[paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]] (PNH), a rare, progressive, and sometimes life-threatening disease characterized by excessive hemolysis; and on September 23, 2011 for the treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) It was approved by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of PNH on June 20, 2007, and on November 29, 2011 for the treatment of aHUS.

==Prognosis==
Acute renal failure occurs in 55-70% of patients with STEC-HUS, although up to 70-85% recover renal function.<ref name=Parmar2010>{{cite web|last=Parmar|first=MS|title=Hemolytic-uremic syndrome|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/201181-overview#a0199|work=Medscape eMedicine|year=2010}}</ref> Patients with aHUS generally have poor outcomes, with up to 50% progressing to ESRD or irreversible brain damage; as many as 25% die during the acute phase.<ref name="Parmar2010"/> However, with aggressive treatment, more than 90% of patients survive the acute phase of HUS, and only about 9% may develop ESRD. Roughly one-third of persons with HUS have abnormal kidney function many years later, and a few require long-term dialysis. Another 8% of persons with HUS have other lifelong complications, such as high blood pressure, seizures, blindness, paralysis, and the effects of having part of their colon removed. The overall mortality rate from HUS is 5-15%. Children and the elderly have a worse prognosis.<ref name=Chu2004>{{cite book|last=Chu, Hemphill|first=P, RR|title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide|year=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-07-138875-3|edition=6th|chapter=222: Acquired hemolytic anemia}}</ref>

==Epidemiology and notable outbreaks==
The overall incidence of HUS is estimated at 2.1 cases per 100,000 persons/year,[42] with a peak incidence between six months and four years of age.<ref name=pmid11691946 />  

HUS and the E. coli infections that cause it have been the source of much negative publicity for the FDA, meat industries, and fast-food restaurants since the 1990s, especially in the contaminations linked to Jack in the Box restaurants. The disease was also featured in the Robin Cook novel Toxin. In 2006, an epidemic of harmful E. coli emerged in the United States due to contaminated spinach. In June, 2009, Nestle Toll House cookie dough was linked to an outbreak of E. coli 0157:H7 in the United States, which sickened 70 people in 30 states.<ref name=pmid11691946 /> 

In May, 2011 an epidemic of bloody diarrhea caused by E. coli O104:H4-contaminated fenugreek seeds hit Germany. Tracing the epidemic revealed more than 3,800 cases, with HUS developing in more than 800 of the cases, including 36 fatal cases. Nearly 90% of the HUS cases were in adults.<ref name=Buchholz>{{cite journal|last=Buchholz, Bernard, Werber|first=U, H, D, et al|title=German outbreak of escherichia coli O104:H4 associated with sprouts|journal=N Engl J MEd|year=2011|volume=365|issue=19|pages=1763–1770|pmid=220229753.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Frank, Werber, Cramer|first=C, D, JP, et al|title=Epidemic profile of Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli O104:H4 outbreak in Germany|journal=N Engl J Med|year=2011|volume=365|issue=19|pages=1711–1780|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1106483|pmid=21696328}}</ref> In response to the crisis, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the makers of Soliris (eculizumab), initiated of an open-label clinical trial to investigate eculizumab as a treatment for patients with Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS).
