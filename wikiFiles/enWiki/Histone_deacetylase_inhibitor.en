'''Histone deacetylase inhibitors''' ('''HDAC inhibitors''', '''HDI''') are a class of compounds that [[enzyme inhibitor|interfere with the function]] of [[histone deacetylase]].

HDIs have a long history of use in psychiatry and neurology as mood stabilizers and anti-epileptics. More recently they are being investigated as possible treatments for cancers and inflammatory diseases.

==Cellular biochemistry/pharmacology==
To carry out gene expression, a cell must control the coiling and uncoiling of DNA around [[histones]].  This is accomplished with the assistance of [[histone acetyltransferase|histone acetylases]] (HAT), which acetylate the lysine residues in core histones leading to a less compact and more transcriptionally active [[chromatin]], and, on the converse, the actions of [[histone deacetylases]] (HDAC), which remove the acetyl groups from the lysine residues leading to the formation of a condensed and transcriptionally silenced chromatin.   Reversible modification of the terminal tails of core histones constitutes the major [[epigenetic]] mechanism for remodeling higher-order chromatin structure and controlling [[gene expression]].  HDAC inhibitors (HDI) block this action and can result in hyperacetylation of histones, thereby affecting gene expression.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thiagalingam S, Cheng KH, Lee HJ, Mineva N, Thiagalingam A, Ponte JF |title=Histone deacetylases: unique players in shaping the epigenetic histone code |journal=Ann.

The histone deacetylase inhibitors are a new class of cytostatic agents that inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells in culture and in vivo by inducing cell cycle arrest, differentiation and/or apoptosis. Histone acetylation and deacetylation play important roles in the modulation of chromatin topology and the regulation of gene transcription. Histone deacetylase inhibition induces the accumulation of hyperacetylated nucleosome core histones in most regions of chromatin but affects the expression of only a small subset of genes, leading to transcriptional activation of some genes, but repression of an equal or larger number of other genes. Non-histone proteins such as transcription factors are also targets for acetylation with varying functional effects. Acetylation enhances the activity of some transcription factors such as the tumor suppressor p53 and the erythroid differentiation factor GATA-1 but may repress transcriptional activity of others including T cell factor and the co-activator ACTR. Recent studies [...] have shown that the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) can be hyperacetylated in response to histone deacetylase inhibition, suppressing ligand sensitivity and regulating transcriptional activation by histone deacetylase inhibitors. Conservation of the acetylated ER-alpha motif in other nuclear receptors suggests that acetylation may play an important regulatory role in diverse nuclear receptor signaling functions. A number of structurally diverse histone deacetylase inhibitors have shown potent antitumor efficacy with little toxicity in vivo in animal models. Several compounds are currently in early phase clinical development as potential treatments for solid and hematological cancers both as monotherapy and in combination with cytotoxics and differentiation agents."<ref name=Vigushin2004>{{cite web |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/ccdt/2004/00000004/00000002/art00007 |title=Targeted Histone Deacetylase Inhibition for Cancer Therapy |author=Vigushin D.M.1; Coombes R.C. |doi=10.2174/1568009043481560 |year=2004 }}</ref>

===HDAC classification===
Based on their homology of accessory domains to [[yeast]] histone deacetylases, the 18 currently known human histone deacetylases are classified into four groups (I-IV):<ref>[http://www.hdacis.com/index.html HDAC Inhibitors Database]</ref>
*Class I, which includes [[HDAC1]], [[HDAC2|-2]], [[HDAC3|-3]] and [[HDAC8|-8]] are related to yeast RPD3 gene;
*Class II, which includes [[HDAC4]], [[HDAC5|-5]], [[HDAC6|-6]], -7, [[HDAC9|-9]] and [[HDAC10|-10]] are related to yeast Hda1 gene;
*Class III, also known as the [[sirtuins]] are related to the Sir2 gene and include SIRT1-7, and
*Class IV, which contains only [[HDAC11]] has features of both Class I and II.

===HDI classification===
The “classical” HDIs act exclusively on Class I and Class II HDACs by binding to the zinc-containing catalytic domain of the HDACs.  These classical HDIs fall into several groupings, in order of decreasing potency:<ref name=Drummond05>{{cite journal |author=Drummond DC, Noble CO, Kirpotin DB, Guo Z, Scott GK, Benz CC |title=Clinical development of histone deacetylase inhibitors as anticancer agents |journal=Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. |volume=45 |pages=495–528 |year=2005 |pmid=15822187 |doi=10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.45.120403.095825 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.45.120403.095825?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}</ref> 
# [[hydroxamic acid]]s (or hydroxamates), such as [[trichostatin A]],
# cyclic tetrapeptides (such as trapoxin B), and the [[depsipeptide]]s,
# [[benzamide]]s,
# electrophilic [[ketone]]s, and
# the [[aliphatic]] acid compounds such as [[Sodium phenylbutyrate|phenylbutyrate]] and [[valproic acid]].

"Second-generation" HDIs include the hydroxamic acids [[vorinostat]] (SAHA), [[belinostat]] (PXD101), [[LAQ824]], and [[panobinostat]] (LBH589); and the [[benzamide]]s : [[entinostat]] (MS-275), [[CI994]], and [[mocetinostat]] (MGCD0103).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beckers T, Burkhardt C, Wieland H, ''et al'' |title=Distinct pharmacological properties of second generation HDAC inhibitors with the benzamide or hydroxamate head group |journal=Int.

The sirtuin Class III HDACs are dependent on NAD+ and are, therefore, inhibited by [[nicotinamide]], as well derivatives of NAD, dihydrocoumarin, naphthopyranone, and 2-hydroxynaphaldehydes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Porcu M, Chiarugi A |title=The emerging therapeutic potential of sirtuin-interacting drugs: from cell death to lifespan extension |journal=Trends Pharmacol.

===Additional functions===
HDIs should not be considered to act solely as enzyme inhibitors of HDACs.  A large variety of nonhistone transcription factors and transcriptional co-regulators are known to be modified by acetylation.  HDIs can alter the degree of acetylation nonhistone effector molecules and, therefore, increase or repress the transcription of genes by this mechanism.  Examples include: [[ACTR]], cMyb, [[E2F1]], [[EKLF]], FEN 1, [[GATA transcription factor|GATA]], HNF-4, [[HSP90]], [[Ku70]], [[NF-κB]], [[PCNA]], p53, [[Retinoblastoma protein|RB]], Runx, SF1 Sp3, [[STAT protein|STAT]], [[TFIIE]], [[T-cell|TCF]], [[YY1]], etc.<ref name=Drummond05/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yang XJ, Seto E |title=HATs and HDACs: from structure, function and regulation to novel strategies for therapy and prevention |journal=Oncogene |volume=26 |issue=37 |pages=5310–8 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17694074 | doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1210599}}</ref>

==Uses==

===Psychiatry and neurology===
HDIs have a long history of use in psychiatry and neurology as mood stabilzers and anti-epileptics.  The prime example of this is [[valproic acid]], marketed as a drug under the trade names ''Depakene'', ''Depakote'', and ''Divalproex''.  In more recent times, HDIs are being studied as a mitigator for [[neurodegenerative diseases]] such as [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Huntington's disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hahnen E, Hauke J, Tränkle C, Eyüpoglu IY, Wirth B, Blümcke I |title=Histone deacetylase inhibitors: possible implications for neurodegenerative disorders |journal=Expert Opin Investig Drugs |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=169–84 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18230051 |doi=10.1517/13543784.17.2.169 |url=http://www.informapharmascience.com/doi/abs/10.1517/13543784.17.2.169}}</ref>

HDAC inhibitors can induce [[p21]] (WAF1) expression, a regulator of [[p53]]'s [[tumor suppressor gene|tumor suppressor]] activity.
