'''Pityriasis alba''' is a common skin condition mostly occurring in children and usually seen as dry, fine-scaled, pale patches on the face. It is self-limiting and usually only requires use of moisturizer creams.

The condition is so named for the fine scaly appearance initially present ([[pityriasis]]) and the pallor of the  patches that develop (while "alba" is Latin for white, the patches in this condition are not totally depigmented).<ref name="Pinto">{{cite journal |author=Pinto FJ, Bolognia JL |title=Disorders of hypopigmentation in children |journal=Pediatr. Clin. North Am. |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=991–1017 |year=1991 |pmid=1870914}}</ref>

==Etiology==
There is no specific known cause for this condition, but public swimming pools could be a factor. Any [[dermatitis]] may heal leaving pale skin, as may excessive use of [[corticosteroid]] creams used to treat episodes of [[eczema]]. The hypopigmentation is due to both reduced activity of [[melanocyte]]s with fewer and smaller [[melanosome]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vargas-Ocampo F |title=Pityriasis alba: a histologic study |journal=Int. J. Dermatol. |volume=32 |issue=12 |pages=870–873 |year=1993 |pmid=8125687 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-4362.1993.tb01401.x}}</ref><ref name="Fitz2">Freedberg, et al. (2003).

The condition is most often seen in children between the ages of 3 and 16 years and is more common in males than females.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Blessmann Weber M, Sponchiado de Avila LG, Albaneze R, Magalhães de Oliveira OL, Sudhaus BD, Cestari TF |title=Pityriasis alba: a study of pathogenic factors |journal=Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=463–468 |year=2002 |pmid=12428838 |doi=10.1046/j.1468-3083.2002.00494.x}}</ref>

==Symptoms and signs==
The dry scaling appearance is most noticeable during the winter as a result of dry air inside people's homes. During the summer, tanning of the surrounding normal skin makes the pale patches of pityriasis alba more prominent.

Individual lesions develop through 3 stages and sometimes are itchy:
# Raised and red - although the redness is often mild and not noticed by parents
# Raised and pale
# Smooth flat pale patches

Lesions are round or oval, of 0.5–2&nbsp;cm in size although may be larger if they occur on the body (up to 4&nbsp;cm), and usually number from 4 or 5 to over 20. The patches are dry with very fine scales. They most commonly occur on the face (cheeks), but in 20% appear also on the upper arms, neck, or shoulders.

The diagnostic differential should consider tinea and vitiligo amongst other causative factors.<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/762656-overview</ref>

==Treatment==
No treatment is required and the patches in time will settle.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lin RL, Janniger CK |title=Pityriasis alba |journal=Cutis; cutaneous medicine for the practitioner |volume=76 |issue=1 |pages=21–4 |year=2005 |pmid=16144284}}</ref>
The redness, scale and itch if present may be managed with simple emollients and sometimes [[hydrocortisone]], a weak steroid, is also used.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harper J |title=Topical corticosteroids for skin disorders in infants and children |journal=Drugs |volume=36 Suppl 5 |issue= |pages=34–7 |year=1988 |pmid=2978289}}</ref>

As the patches of pityriasis alba do not darken normally in sunlight, effective sun protection helps minimise the discrepancy in colouration against the surrounding normal skin. [[Cosmetic camouflage]] may be required. 

[[Tacrolimus]] has been reported as speeding resolution.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rigopoulos D, Gregoriou S, Charissi C, Kontochristopoulos G, Kalogeromitros D, Georgala S |title=Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% in pityriasis alba: an open-label, randomized, placebo-controlled study |journal=Br. J. Dermatol. |volume=155 |issue=1 |pages=152–155 |year=2006 |pmid=16792767 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2006.07181.x}}</ref> 

In exceptionally severe cases [[PUVA]] therapy may be considered.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Di Lernia V, Ricci C |title=Progressive and extensive hypomelanosis and extensive pityriasis alba: same disease, different names? |journal=Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=370–372 |year=2005 |pmid=15857470 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-3083.2004.01170.x}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The patches of pityriasis alba may last from 1 month to about one year, but commonly on the face last a year.
