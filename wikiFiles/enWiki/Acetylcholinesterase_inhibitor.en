An '''acetylcholinesterase inhibitor''' (often abbreviated AChEI) or '''anti-cholinesterase''' is a [[chemical compound|chemical]] that inhibits the [[acetylcholinesterase|acetylcholinesterase enzyme]] from breaking down [[acetylcholine]], thereby increasing both the level and duration of action of the [[neurotransmitter]] acetylcholine. Reversible, quasi-irreversible (or pseudirreversible in some sources) and irreversible inhibitors exist.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pohanka|first=M|title= Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors; a patent review (2008-present)|journal= Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Patents |year=2012|volume=22|pages=871–886|pmid= 22768972|doi=10.1517/13543776.2012.701620|url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1517/13543776.2012.701620 }}</ref> 

== Uses ==

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors:

* Occur naturally as [[venom (poison)|venoms]] and [[poison]]s 
* Are used as weapons in the form of [[nerve agent]]s

=== Natural Compounds ===

* [[Huperzine A]]
* [[Galantamine]]
* [[Onchidal]]
* [[Coumarins]]

== Effects ==

Some major effects of cholinesterase inhibitors:

* Actions on the [[parasympathetic nervous system]], (the [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic branch]] of the [[autonomic nervous system]]) may cause [[bradycardia]], [[hypotension]], [[hypersecretion]], [[bronchoconstriction]], [[diarrhea|GI tract hypermotility]], and decrease [[intraocular pressure]].
* [[SLUDGE syndrome]].
* Actions on the neuromuscular junction will result in prolonged muscle contraction.
Administration of reversible cholinoesterase inhibitors is contraindicated with those that have urinary retention due to obstruction.

==Titration phase==
When used in the central nervous system to alleviate neurological symptoms, such as [[rivastigmine]] in [[Alzheimer's disease]], all cholinesterase inhibitors require doses to be increased gradually over several weeks, and this is usually referred to as the ''titration phase''. Many other types drug treatments may require a titration or stepping up phase. This strategy is used to build tolerance to adverse events or to reach a desired clinical effect. <ref name=Inglis>{{cite journal | last1 = Inglis | first1 = F | title = The tolerability and safety of cholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of dementia. | journal = International journal of clinical practice.
