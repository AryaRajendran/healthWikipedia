'''Behavioral optometry''' also known as '''functional optometry''' is an expanded area of [[optometry|optometric practice]] that uses a [[Holism|holistic]] approach to the treatment of vision and [[visual perception|vision information processing]] problems. The practice of behavioral optometry incorporates various [[vision therapy]] methods and has been characterized as a [[alternative medicine|complementary alternative medicine]] practice.<ref>{{cite journal | author=American Academy of Ophthalmology | year=2001 | title=Complementary Therapy Assessment: Vision Therapy for Learning Disabilities.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=American Academy of Ophthalmology | year=2004 | title=Complementary Therapy Assessment.

==History==
Behavioral optometry is considered by some optometrists to have its origins in [[orthoptic]] [[vision therapy]]. However, [[Vision therapy]] is differentiated between strabismic/orthoptic vision therapy (which [[Orthoptist]]s and [[Ophthalmologist]]s practice) and non-strabismic vision therapy.<ref>Birnbaum MH.

PMID 8014367.</ref> [[A.M. Skeffington]] was an American [[optometrist]] known to some as "the father of behavioral optometry".<ref name="Visionaries">[http://legacy.revoptom.com/archive/resource/visionaries.htm#skeffington "A.M.

Part of behavioral vision care is concerned with impact of visual "skills" on performing visual tasks. Various behaviors and poor performance during visual tasks may suggest non-optimal visual skills. For example this could manifest as eyestrain symptoms experienced during visual tasks, or adopting poor posture (e.g. leaning in too close to visual material). Another example, could be difficulty understanding maps, difficulty recalling visual information, difficulty completing jigsaws and difficulty drawing/copying/interpreting visual information.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Claims have been made that behavioral optometry can aid with visual problems with symptoms similar to cognitive, behavioral or language disorders such as [[ADHD]] and [[dyslexia]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} It is therefore popular among parents who may not want their children to be stigmatized by being labeled with a cognitive or language impairment, as it claims that poor vision could be the real cause of their disorder.<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news|title=Concocting a Cure for Kids With Issues|publisher=New York Times|author= Judith Warner|date=March 10, 2010|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/magazine/14vision-t.html?pagewanted=1&hp}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=February 2012}}

==Research==
In 1944-1945 the Wilmer Eye Institute of [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in Baltimore undertook a study of the use of behavioral optometry in the treatment of myopia.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Woods |first=Alan C.  |year=1946 |month= January|title=Report from the Wilmer Institute on the Results obtained in the Treatment of Myopia by Visual Training | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/122273882/PDFSTART |journal=American Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=29 |issue= 1|pages= 28&ndash;57}}</ref> The training was undertaken by [[A. M. Skeffington]] and his associates, who traveled to Baltimore for the purpose, but who used a clinic outside the hospital, and were carefully kept apart from the staff in the Wilmer Institute who assessed their progress. The 103 candidates were school students and young adults with uncomplicated myopia. Independent examination before and after training was undertaken using [[Snellen chart]]s, and use of a [[retinoscope]] after introduction of a [[cycloplegic]] agent. The examining physicians "were impressed by a psychologic improvement in a number of patients. Some patients while exhibiting no material change in their visual acuity, were nevertheless convinced that they saw better and that they used their eyes with greater satisfaction to themselves." The objective results were as follows. Of the 103 subjects:
*30 showed some improvement on all measures
*31 showed overall improvement, but not on all measures
*32 showed no overall change
*10 showed deterioration of vision

The report's author concludes "With the possible exception of educating some patients to interpret blurred retinal images more carefully and of convincing some others that they could see better even though there was no actual improvement, this study indicates that the visual training used on these patients was of no value for the treatment of myopia."

A review in 2000 concluded that there were insufficient controlled studies of the approach<ref name=Jennings>{{cite journal | author=Jennings | year=2000 | title=Behavioural optometry – a critical review. | journal=Optometry in Practice | volume=1 | issue=67}}</ref> and a 2008 review concluded that "a large majority of behavioural management approaches are not evidence-based, and thus cannot be advocated."<ref name=Barrett>{{cite journal | journal=Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics | volume=29 | issue=1 | pages=4–25 | title=A critical evaluation of the evidence supporting the practice of behavioural vision therapy | author=Brendan T.

===Case studies===
In 2006, neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] published a case study about "Stereo Sue" ([[Susan R. Barry]]), a woman who was strabismic and stereoblind since early infancy and who developed [[stereo vision]] after undergoing vision therapy.<ref name=Sacks>{{cite news | author=Sacks, Oliver | title=A Neurologist's Notebook: "Stereo Sue" | publisher=The New Yorker | date=June 19, 2006 | pages=64}}</ref> Barry, a professor of neurobiology, later published a memoir, ''Fixing My Gaze: a Scientist's Journey into Seeing in Three Dimensions'',<ref>Barry, Susan R. Sacks, Oliver. (2009)  Fixing My Gaze: A Scientist's Journey into Seeing in Three Dimensions.  New  York: Basic Books.  ISBN 978-0-465-00913-8</ref> describing the therapy, the science underlying it, and her experience with it.
