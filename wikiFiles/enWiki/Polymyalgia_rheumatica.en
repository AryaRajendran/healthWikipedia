'''Polymyalgia rheumatica''' (which takes its name from the word "polymyalgia" which means "pain in many muscles" in [[Greek language|Greek]] followed by the term "rheumatica") abbreviated as '''PMR''', is a syndrome with pain or stiffness, usually in the [[neck]], [[shoulders]], and [[Hip (anatomy)|hips]]. The pain can be very sudden, or can occur gradually over a period. It may be caused by an inflammatory condition of blood vessels such as [[temporal arteritis]].

Most PMR sufferers wake up in the morning with pain in their [[muscles]]; however, there have been cases in which the patient has developed the pain during the evenings.<ref name="WebMD">{{cite web |author=Gelfand JL |title=Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis |url=http://arthritis.webmd.com/polymyalgia-rheumatica-temporal-arteritis |date=November 18, 2007 |publisher=[[WebMD]] |accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref> Patients who have polymyalgia rheumatica may also have [[temporal arteritis]], a potentially dangerous inflammation of blood vessels in the face. 

PMR is usually treated with courses of oral [[corticosteroid]]s.<ref>{{emedicine|article|330815|Polymyalgia rheumatica}}</ref> Most people need to continue the corticosteroid treatment for two to three years.<ref name="Mayoclinic treatments 2010">{{cite web |author= |title=Polymyalgia Rheumatica treatments and drugs |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/polymyalgia-rheumatica/DS00441/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs |date=Dec 04, 2010 |publisher=MayoClinic |accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref> PMR usually goes away on its own in a year or two, but medications and self-care measures can improve the rate of recovery.<ref>{{cite web |author= |title=Polymyalgia Rheumatica definition |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080623104752/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/polymyalgia-rheumatica/DS00441 |date=May 17, 2008 |publisher=MayoClinic |accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref>

==Symptoms and signs==
There are a wide range of symptoms that indicate if a person has polymyalgia rheumatica. The classic symptoms include:

* Pain and stiffness (moderate to severe) in the [[neck]], [[shoulders]], and [[Hip (anatomy)|hips]], which inhibits activity, especially in the morning/after sleeping.
* [[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]] and lack of appetite (possibly leading to weight loss) are also indicative of polymyalgia rheumatica.
* [[Anaemia]]
* An overall feeling of illness
* Low-grade (mild) fever<ref>{{cite web |author= |title=Polymyalgia Rheumatica symptoms |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/polymyalgia-rheumatica/DS00441/DSECTION=symptoms |date=Dec 04, 2010 |publisher=MayoClinic |accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref>

Studies have shown that about 15% of people who are diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica also have [[temporal arteritis]], and about 50% of people with [[temporal arteritis]] have polymyalgia rheumatica. Some symptoms of [[temporal arteritis]] include severe [[headaches]], scalp tenderness, [[jaw]] or facial soreness, [[distorted vision]] or aching in the limbs caused by decreased blood flow, and [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].<ref name="WebMD"/>

==Causes==
The cause of PMR is not well understood. The pain and stiffness result from the activity of inflammatory cells and proteins that are normally a part of the body's disease-fighting immune system, and the inflammatory activity seems to be concentrated in tissues surrounding the affected joints.<ref name="Mayoclinic causes 2010">{{cite web |author= |title=Polymyalgia Rheumatica causes |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/polymyalgia-rheumatica/DS00441/DSECTION=causes |date=Dec 04, 2010 |publisher=MayoClinic |accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref> During this disorder, the white blood cells in the body attack the lining of the joints, causing inflammation.<ref name="Mayoclinic causes 2008">{{cite web |author= |title=Polymyalgia Rheumatica causes |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080623200033/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/polymyalgia-rheumatica/DS00441/DSECTION=causes |date=May 17, 2008 |publisher=MayoClinic |accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref>  Recent studies have found that inherited factors also play a role in the probability that an individual will develop polymyalgia rheumatica. Several theories have included viral stimulation of the [[immune system]] in genetically susceptible individuals.<ref name="MedicineNet">{{cite web |author=Shiel Jr WC |title=Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) & Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis) |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/polymyalgia_rheumatica/article.htm |date=2008-03-13 |publisher=MedicineNet |accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>

Infectious disease may be a contributing factor. This would be expected with sudden onset of symptoms for example. In addition, appearance of new cases often appear in cycles in the general population, implying a viral connection. Studies are inconclusive, however several somewhat common viruses were identified as possible triggers for PMR.<ref name="Mayoclinic causes 2010"/> The [[viruses]] thought to be involved include the [[adenovirus]], which causes respiratory infections; the human [[parvovirus B19]], an infection that affects children; and the [[human parainfluenza virus]].<ref name="Mayoclinic causes 2008"/>

People who have the [[HLA-DR4]] type of [[human leucocyte antigen]] appear to have a higher risk of polymyalgia rheumatica.<ref name=agabegi2nd255>Page 255 in: {{cite book |author=Elizabeth D Agabegi; Agabegi, Steven S. |title=Step-Up to Medicine (Step-Up Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7153-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

One reported cause is food sensitivities. Sufferers often do not know they are affected by them, but medical tests exist to verify.
==Diagnosis==
There is no specific test to diagnose polymyalgia rheumatica. There are many other diseases which cause inflammation and pain in [[muscles]], but there are a few tests that can help narrow down the cause of the pain. Limitation in shoulder motion, or swelling of the joints in the wrists or hands are noted by the doctor.<ref name="MedicineNet"/> A patient's answers to questions, a general physical exam, and the results of tests can help a doctor determine the cause of pain and stiffness.<ref name="Mayoclinic diagnosis 2010">{{cite web |author= |title=Polymyalgia Rheumatica tests and diagnosis |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/polymyalgia-rheumatica/DS00441/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis |date=Dec 04, 2010 |publisher=MayoClinic |accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref>

One [[blood test]] that is usually performed is the [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR) which measures how fast the patient's red blood cells settle in a test tube. The faster the blood cells settle, the higher the ESR value, which means that there is inflammation. Many conditions can cause an elevated ESR, so this test alone is not proof that a person has polymyalgia rheumatica.<ref name="Mayoclinic diagnosis 2010"/><ref name="Mayoclinic diagnosis 2008">{{cite web |author= |title=Polymyalgia Rheumatica tests and diagnosis |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080623203621/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/polymyalgia-rheumatica/DS00441/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis |date=May 17, 2008 |publisher=MayoClinic |accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref>

Another test that checks the level of [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP) in the blood may also be conducted. CRP is produced by the liver in response to an injury or infection and people with polymyalgia rheumatica usually have high levels.<ref name="Mayoclinic diagnosis 2010"/><ref name="Mayoclinic diagnosis 2008"/> However, like the ESR, this test is also very non-specific.

Polymyalgia rheumatica is sometimes associated with [[temporal arteritis]], a condition requiring more aggressive therapy. To test for this additional disorder, a [[biopsy]] sample may be taken of the [[temporal artery]].<ref name="Mayoclinic diagnosis 2010"/>

==Treatment==
[[Prednisone]] is the drug of choice for PMR<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hernández-Rodríguez J, Cid MC, López-Soto A, Espigol-Frigolé G, Bosch X |title=Treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica: a systematic review |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=169 |issue=20 |pages=1839–50 |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19901135 |doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2009.352 |url=}}</ref> and treatment duration is frequently greater than one year.<ref name="MedicineNet"/>  If the patient does not experience dramatic improvement after three days of 10–20&nbsp;mg oral prednisone per day, the diagnosis should be reconsidered.<ref>{{cite book |author=McPhee, Stephen J.; Papadakis, Maxine A. |title=2010 Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment|page= 767}}</ref>

Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as [[ibuprofen]] are ineffective in the initial treatment of PMR,<ref name="ACR">{{cite web |author=Docken WP |title=Polymyalgia rheumatica |url=http://www.rheumatology.org/practice/clinical/patients/diseases_and_conditions/polymyalgiarheumatica.asp |month=August | year=2009 |publisher=American College of Rheumatology |accessdate=2012-01-20}}</ref> but they may be used in conjunction with the maintenance dose of corticosteroid.<ref>{{cite web |author=MDGuidelines |title=Polymyalgia rheumatica |url=http://www.mdguidelines.com/polymyalgia-rheumatica |month=August | year=1991-2010 |publisher=Reed Group |accessdate=2012-01-20}}</ref>

Along with medical treatment, patients are encouraged to exercise and eat healthily. [[Exercise]] will help strengthen the weak [[muscles]], and help to prevent weight gain. A healthy diet will help to keep a strong [[immune system]], and also help build strong muscles and bones.<ref name="Mayoclinic lifestyle 2008">{{cite web |author= |title=Polymyalgia Rheumatica lifestyle and home remedies |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080623203610/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/polymyalgia-rheumatica/DS00441/DSECTION=lifestyle-and-home-remedies |date=May 17, 2008 |publisher=MayoClinic |accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref> Eat a diet of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat meat and dairy products. Avoid foods with high levels of refined sugars and salt (sodium).<ref name="Mayoclinic lifestyle 2010">{{cite web |author= |title=Polymyalgia Rheumatica lifestyle and home remedies |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/polymyalgia-rheumatica/DS00441/DSECTION=lifestyle-and-home-remedies |date=Dec 04, 2010 |publisher=MayoClinic |accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
There are no certain circumstances for which an individual will get polymyalgia rheumatica, but there are a few factors that show a relationship with the disorder.
*Usually affects adults over the age of 60<ref name="WebMD"/>
*The average age of a person who has PMR is about 70 years old<ref name="WebMD"/><ref name="Mayoclinic risk factors 2010">{{cite web |author= |title=Polymyalgia Rheumatica risk factors |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/polymyalgia-rheumatica/DS00441/DSECTION=risk-factors |date=Dec 04, 2010 |publisher=MayoClinic |accessdate=2012-01-19}}</ref> 
*Women are twice as likely to get PMR as men<ref name="Mayoclinic risk factors 2010"/>
*Caucasians are more likely to get this disease.<ref name="WebMD"/> It is more likely to affect people of Northern European origin, Scandinavians are especially vulnerable.<ref name="Mayoclinic risk factors 2010"/>
*50% of people with [[temporal arteritis]] also have polymyalgia rheumatica<ref name="WebMD"/>
