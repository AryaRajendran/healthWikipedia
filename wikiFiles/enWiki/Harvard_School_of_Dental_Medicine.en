'''Harvard School of Dental Medicine''' (HSDM) is one of the graduate schools of [[Harvard University]]. It is an American dental school located in the [[Longwood Medical and Academic Area|Longwood Medical Area]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. In addition to the DMD degree, HSDM offers specialty training programs, advanced training programs,  a Ph.D. program affiliated with the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and Master of Medical Sciences & Doctor of Medical Sciences degrees in Oral Biology. Admission into the pre-doctoral DMD program is fiercely competitive, as each entering class consists of only 35 students. At its heart, the program considers dentistry a specialty of medicine. Therefore, its students experience dual citizenship in both Harvard School of Dental Medicine and Harvard Medical School.

Today, HSDM is the smallest school at Harvard University. With a total student body of 280, including pre-doctoral and post-doctoral students spread over several disciplines, HSDM is an intimate community of students and faculty. Even when compared to other dental schools, HSDM is small, and its total living alumni number is approximately 2,300 worldwide. While HSDM is small, it continues to have considerable influence on dental education and research within the broader oral health community. Many other HSDM alumni pursue careers as full-time faculty members, department heads, and leaders of organized dentistry.

==History==
===First university-based dental school===
In the early 19th century most dental practitioners had either learned their "trade" through apprenticeships, or they simply offered their services to the public as self-proclaimed experts. The move toward more formal dental education in the United States began when the state of Maryland chartered the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery in 1840. The establishment of this independent college, which may have occurred after the University of Maryland refused to add dental education to its curriculum, exemplified the nineteenth-century debate over whether dentistry should be part of scholarly education, or be taught in separate "trade" schools.<ref>"Dental Education at the Crossroads." 1995. Report by Institute of Medicine (National Academy Press). Editor: Marilyn J. Field. Pg.39</ref> As a result of this resistance, the four American dental schools that existed by 1865 were all freestanding. The move towards university-based dental education institutions (as they exist today) began with the formation of Harvard Dental School in 1867.  Dr. [[Reidar Fauske Sognnaes]], noted oral pathologist and founding dean of the UCLA School of Dentistry, commented on the significance of the school's formation in a 1977 [[New England Journal of Medicine]] article: 

:''There was a time when the mouth, relatively speaking, was considered a scientific "no-man's land." That was when dental education fell between academic chairs--literally between the eyes, ears, nose and throat. In the United States dentistry was denied the academic status of other segments of higher education until 1867, when Harvard established the first dental school affiliated with a university-based faculty of medicine.''<ref>"Why "mouthless" medical schools?" ''New England Journal of Medicine''. 1977. Oct 13;297(15):837-8. Sognnaes, RF. </ref>

===Origins of DMD degree===
Harvard was the first dental school to award the [[Doctor of Dental Medicine|DMD]] degree.<ref>[http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-dentistry/prospective-students/dmd-program/ ohsu.edu]</ref> Harvard University only grants degrees in Latin and school administrators thought the Latin translation of [[Doctor of Dental Surgery]] ("Chirurgae Dentium Doctoris," or CDD) was too cumbersome. A Latin scholar was consulted and suggested "Medicinae Doctor" be prefixed with "Dentariae." This is how the DMD, or "Dentariae Medicinae Doctorae" degree, was started. Other dental schools made the switch to this notation, and in 1989, 23 of the 66 North American dental schools awarded the D.M.D. There is no difference between the DMD and DDS degree; all dentists must meet the same national and regional certification standards.<ref>"Public perception of DDS versus DMD degrees." ''Journal of the American College of Dentists''. 1999. Fall; 66(3):29-37. Lalumandier, JA.</ref>

===Renaming the school===
The school was established as Harvard Dental School in 1867, but renamed the Harvard School of Dental Medicine in 1940. This symbolic change was made to emphasize the biological basis of oral medicine and the increasingly multidisciplinary focus of dental research.

===Expansion of postdoctoral educational programs===
In 1957, Harvard School of Dental Medicine was awarded a training grant from the National Institute of Dental Research (now the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research) to expand its postdoctoral training programs. These new programs included an [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]]/[[Doctor of Medicine|MD]]/[[general surgery]] residency program; a Doctor of Medical Sciences (DMSc) in Oral Biology; and 3- and 4-year joint-degree programs with an emphasis on combining clinical training with research into [[health policy]], [[public health]], and/or biomedical sciences.

The school's current post-doctoral programs include both school-based and hospital based residencies. School-based programs award the Master of Medical Science (MMSc) degree, with an optional Doctor of Medical Sciences (DMSc) degree available for those spending extra time on research activities.

===Major changes in predoctoral curriculum 1994===
In 1994, a major change in the predoctoral curriculum included an increase of the predoctoral class size to 35, introduction of problem-based curriculum, and a switch from a 5-year program to a 4-year case based curriculum.

===Harvard Odontological Society===
The Harvard Odontological Society was established in 1878 to promote education and good fellowship amongst graduates and faculty of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. In continuous operation for over 130 years, the society meets four times a year in a Boston, Massachusetts venue to hold a regular business meeting and an educational presentation of interest to its members.

===Harvard Dental Alumni Association===

The Harvard School of Dental Medicine has an active group of over 2500 alumni who continue to participate in the day-to-day events of the school and are major contributors to the school's vision and goals for the new millennium.  In addition to publishing a quarterly bulletin, marking the current events of the school as well as the achievements of alumni, the Association also sponsors the annual Gold Medal and Silver Medal awards at graduation, honoring the [[valedictorian]] and [[salutatorian]] of the graduating class, respectively.
