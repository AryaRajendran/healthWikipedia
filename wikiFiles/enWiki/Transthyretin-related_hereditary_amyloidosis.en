'''Familial amyloid polyneuropathy''' (FAP), also called '''transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis''', '''[[transthyretin]] [[amyloidosis]]''' or '''Corino de Andrade's disease''',<ref name=omim>{{OMIM|105210}}</ref> is an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]]<ref name=fapad>{{cite pmid|18508604}}</ref> [[neurodegenerative]] disease.

FAP can be ameliorated by liver transplantation. 

== Characteristics ==
Usually manifesting itself between 20 and 40 years of age, it is characterized by [[pain]], [[paresthesia]], [[muscular weakness]] and [[autonomic dysfunction]]. In its terminal state, the [[kidneys]] and the [[heart]] are affected. FAP is characterized by the systemic deposition of [[amyloidogenic]] variants of the [[transthyretin]] [[protein]], especially in the [[peripheral nervous system]], causing a progressive sensory and motor [[polyneuropathy]].

== Cause and genetics ==
[[Image:Autosomal dominant - en.svg|thumb|right|Familial amyloid polyneuropathy has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.]]
FAP is caused by a mutation of the [[Transthyretin|TTR]] gene, located on human [[chromosome]] [[chromosome 18 (human)|18q12.1-11.2]].<ref>{{OMIM|176300}}</ref> A replacement of valine by methionine at position 30 (TTR V30M) is the mutation most commonly found in FAP.<ref name=omim/> The variant TTR is mostly produced by the liver.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} The [[transthyretin]] protein is a tetramer. The tetramer has to dissociate into misfolded monomers to aggregate into a variety of structures including amyloid fibrils. Because most patients are heterozygotes, they deposit both mutant and wild type TTR subnits.

FAP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.<ref name=fapad/> This means that the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an [[autosome]] (chromosome 18 is an autosome), and only one copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the disorder, when inherited from a parent who has the disorder.

==Prognosis==
In the absence of a [[Liver transplantation|liver transplant]], FAP is invariably fatal, usually within a decade. The disadvantage of liver transplantation is approximately 10% of the subjects die from the procedure or complications resulting from the procedure, which is a form of gene therapy wherein the liver expressing wild type and mutant TTR is replaced by a liver only expressing wild type TTR. Moreover, transplanted patients must take immune suppressants (drugs) for the remainder of their life, which can lead to additional complications. In late 2011, the [[European Medicines Agency]] approved the transthyretin kinetic stabilizer [[Tafamidis]] or Vyndaqel discovered by [[Jeffery W. Kelly]] and developed by FoldRx pharmaceuticals (acquired by Pfizer in 2010) for the treatment of FAP based on clinical trial data. [[Tafamidis]] (20&nbsp;mg once daily) slowed the progression of FAP over a 36 month period and importantly reversed the weight loss and muscle wasting associated with disease progression.

== Epidemiology ==

This disease is [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in Portuguese locations [[Póvoa de Varzim]] and [[Vila do Conde]] ([[Caxinas]]), with more than 1000 affected people, coming from about 500 families, where 70% of the people develop the illness. In northern [[Sweden]], more specifically [[Piteå]], [[Skellefteå]] and [[Umeå]], 1.5% of the population has the mutated gene. There are many other populations in the world who exhibit the illness after having developed it independently.

== Regulatory Agency Approved Treatments ==
The drug [[tafamidis]]<ref>[http://portal.acs.org/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=PP_ARTICLEMAIN&node_id=841&content_id=CNBP_024655&use_sec=true&sec_url_var=region1 Tafamidis structure]</ref> has completed a phase II/III 18 month long placebo controlled clinical trial<ref>[http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00409175 Safety and Efficacy Study of Fx-1006A in Patients With Familial Amyloidosis – ClinicalTrials.gov ref: NCT00409175]</ref>
and these results in combination with an 18 month follow-on study demonstrated that [[Tafamidis]] or Vyndaqel slowed progression of FAP, particularly when administered to patients early in the course of FAP.<ref>http://protomag.ticsnetwork.com/statics/MGH_SP10_Protein_fold_F2.pdf</ref> This drug is now approved by the [[European Medicines Agency]].

The US [[Food and Drug Administration]]'s Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee rejected the drug in June 2012, in a 13-4 vote.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/PeripheralandCentralNervousSystemDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM304830.pdf</ref> The committee stated that there was not enough evidence supporting efficacy of the drug, and requested additional clinical trials.<ref>http://www.bioworld.com/content/fda-delivers-crl-pfizers-rare-disease-drug-vyndaqel-0</ref>

==Animal models==
Combined [[Doxycycline]] and [[TUDCA]] treatment (in human tolerable doses) significantly lowered fibrillar [[Transthyretin]] (TTR) amyloid deposition in transgenic TTR mouse models.  The authors propose this treatment in FAP, particularly in the early stages of disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cardoso I, Martins D, Ribeiro T, Merlini G, Saraiva MJ |month=Jul |year=2010 |title=Synergy of combined doxycycline/TUDCA treatment in lowering Transthyretin deposition and associated biomarkers: studies in FAP mouse models |journal=Journal of Translational Medicine |volume=8 |page=74 |pmid=20673327 |pmc=2922089 |format=Free full text |doi=10.1186/1479-5876-8-74}}</ref>
