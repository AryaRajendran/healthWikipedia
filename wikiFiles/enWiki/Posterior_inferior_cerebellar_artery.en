The '''posterior inferior cerebellar artery''' (PICA), the largest branch of the [[vertebral artery]], is one of the three main [[artery|arterial]] [[blood]] supplies for the [[cerebellum]], part of the [[brain]]. Occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery or one of its branches, or of the vertebral artery leads to [[Lateral medullary syndrome|Wallenberg syndrome]], also called ''lateral medullary syndrome''.

==Course==
It winds backward around the upper part of the [[medulla oblongata]], passing between the origins of the [[vagus]] and [[accessory nerve]]s, over the [[inferior cerebellar peduncle]] to the undersurface of the [[cerebellum]], where it divides into two branches. 

The medial branch continues backward to the notch between the two hemispheres of the cerebellum; while the lateral supplies the under surface of the cerebellum, as far as its lateral border, where it [[anastomosis|anastomoses]] with the [[anterior inferior cerebellar artery|anterior inferior cerebellar]] and the [[superior cerebellar artery|superior cerebellar]] branches of the [[basilar artery]]. 

Branches from this artery supply the [[choroid plexus]] of the [[fourth ventricle]].

==Diseases==
[[Infarction]] of this artery due to [[thrombosis]] or a [[stroke]] leads to [[lateral medullary syndrome]], also known as ''PICA syndrome'' or ''Wallenberg syndrome.'' Severe occlusion of this or vertebral arteries could lead to [[Horner's Syndrome]] as well.
