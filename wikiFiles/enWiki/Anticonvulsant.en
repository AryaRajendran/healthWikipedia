The '''anticonvulsants''' (also commonly known as '''antiepileptic drugs''') are a diverse group of [[pharmacology|pharmaceuticals]] used in the treatment of [[epilepsy|epileptic]] [[seizure]]s. Anticonvulsants are also increasingly being used in the treatment of [[bipolar disorder]], since many seem to act as [[mood stabilizers]], and for the treatment of [[neuropathic pain]]. The goal of an anticonvulsant is to suppress the rapid and excessive firing of [[neuron]]s that start a seizure. Failing this, an effective anticonvulsant would prevent the spread of the seizure within the brain and offer protection against possible [[excitotoxicity|excitotoxic]] effects, that may result in [[brain damage]]. Some studies have cited that anticonvulsants themselves are linked to lowered [[IQ]] in children.<ref>{{cite journal

Anticonvulsants are more accurately called '''antiepileptic drugs''' (abbreviated "AEDs"), and are sometimes referred to as '''antiseizure drugs.''' While the term 'anticonvulsant' is a fair description of AEDs, the use of this term tends to lead to confusion between epilepsy and non-epileptic convulsions. Convulsive [[non-epileptic seizures]] are quite common, and these types of seizures do not respond to antiepileptic drugs. In epilepsy, an area of the cortex is typically hyper-irritable.  This condition can often be confirmed by completing a diagnostic EEG. Antiepileptic drugs function to help reduce this area of irritability and thus prevent epileptiform seizures.

Conventional antiepileptic drugs block sodium channels or enhance g-aminobutyric acid function. Several antiepileptic drugs have multiple or uncertain mechanisms of action.<ref>https://www.neurology.wisc.edu/publications/2010%20pubs/stafstrom-4.pdf</ref> Next to the voltage-gated sodium channels and components of the [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]] system, their targets include GABA<sub>A</sup> receptors, the GAT-1 GABA transporter, and [[GABA transaminase]].<ref name="rogawski">{{cite journal | pmid = 15208697 | doi=10.1038/nrn1430 | volume=5 | issue=7 | title=The neurobiology of antiepileptic drugs | year=2004 | month=July | author=Rogawski MA, L&ouml;scher W | journal=Nat.

Some anticonvulsants have shown antiepileptogenic effects in animal models of epilepsy. That is, they either prevent the expected development of epilepsy or can halt or reverse the progression of epilepsy. However, no drug has been shown to prevent [[epileptogenesis]] (the development of epilepsy after an injury such as a [[traumatic brain injury|head injury]]) in human trials.<ref name="pmid17998971">{{cite journal |author=Abou-Khalil BW |title=Comparative Monotherapy Trials and the Clinical Treatment of Epilepsy |journal=Epilepsy currents / American Epilepsy Society |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=127–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17998971 |doi=10.1111/j.1535-7511.2007.00198.x |pmc=2043140}}</ref>

==Approval==

The usual method of achieving approval for a drug is to show it is effective when compared against [[placebo]], or that it is more effective than an existing drug. In monotherapy (where only one drug is taken) it is considered unethical by most to conduct a trial with placebo on a new drug of uncertain efficacy. This is because untreated epilepsy leaves the patient at significant risk of death. Therefore, almost all new epilepsy drugs are initially approved only as adjunctive (add-on) therapies. Patients whose epilepsy is currently uncontrolled by their medication (i.e., it is refractory to treatment) are selected to see if supplementing the medication with the new drug leads to an improvement in seizure control. Any reduction in the frequency of seizures is compared against a placebo.<ref name="pmid17998971"/> The lack of superiority over existing treatment, combined with lacking placebo-controlled trials, means that few modern drugs have earned FDA approval as initial monotherapy. In contrast, Europe only requires equivalence to existing treatments, and has approved many more. Despite their lack of FDA approval, the [[American Academy of Neurology]] and the American Epilepsy Society still recommend a number of these new drugs as initial monotherapy.<ref name="pmid17998971"/>

==Drugs==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}
In the following list, the dates in parentheses are the earliest approved use of the drug.

===Aldehydes===
{{main|Aldehyde}}
* [[Paraldehyde]] (1882). One of the earliest anticonvulsants. Still used to treat [[status epilepticus]], particularly where there are no resuscitation facilities.

===Aromatic allylic alcohols===
* [[Stiripentol]] (2001 - limited availability). Indicated for the treatment of severe [[myoclonic seizure|myoclonic]] epilepsy in infancy (SMEI).

===Barbiturates===
{{main|Barbiturate}}
[[Barbiturate]]s are [[medication|drugs]] that act as central nervous system (CNS) [[depressant]]s, and by virtue of this they produce a wide spectrum of effects, from mild [[sedation]] to [[anesthesia]].  The following are [[ATC code N03|classified]] as anticonvulsants:

* [[Phenobarbital]] (1912). See also the related drug [[primidone]].
* [[Methylphenobarbital]] (1935). Known as mephobarbital in the US. No longer marketed in the UK
* [[Barbexaclone]] (1982). Only available in some European countries.

Phenobarbital was the main anticonvulsant from 1912 till the development of phenytoin in 1938. Today, phenobarbital is rarely used to treat epilepsy in new patients since there are other effective drugs that are less sedating. Phenobarbital sodium injection can be used to stop acute convulsions or [[status epilepticus]], but a benzodiazepine such as lorazepam, diazepam or midazolam is usually tried first. Other barbiturates only have an anticonvulsant effect at anaesthetic doses.

===Benzodiazepines===
{{main|Benzodiazepine}}
The benzodiazepines are a class of [[medication|drugs]] with [[hypnotic]], [[anxiolytic]], anticonvulsive, [[amnesia|amnestic]] and [[muscle relaxant]] properties. Benzodiazepines act as a central nervous system depressant. The relative strength of each of these properties in any given benzodiazepine varies greatly and influences the indications for which it is prescribed. Long-term use can be problematic due to the development of [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] to the anticonvulsant effects and [[Substance use disorder|dependency]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Browne TR |year=1976 |month=May |title=Clonazepam.

* [[Clobazam]] (1979). Notably used on a short-term basis around menstruation in women with [[catamenial epilepsy]].
* [[Clonazepam]] (1974).
* [[Clorazepate]] (1972).

The following benzodiazepines are used to treat [[status epilepticus]]:

* [[Diazepam]] (1963). Can be given rectally by trained care-givers.
* [[Midazolam]] (N/A). Increasingly being used as an alternative to diazepam. This water-soluble drug is squirted into the side of the mouth but not swallowed. It is rapidly absorbed by the [[buccal mucosa]].
* [[Lorazepam]] (1972). Given by injection in hospital.

[[Nitrazepam]], [[temazepam]], and especially [[nimetazepam]] are powerful anticonvulsant agents, however their use is rare due to an increased incidence of side effects and strong sedative and motor-impairing properties.

===Bromides===
{{main|Bromide}}
* [[Potassium bromide]] (1857). The earliest effective treatment for epilepsy. There would not be a better drug until phenobarbital in 1912. It is still used as an anticonvulsant for dogs and cats.

===Carbamates===
{{main|Carbamate}}
* [[Felbamate]] (1993). This effective anticonvulsant has had its usage severely restricted due to rare but life-threatening side effects.

===Carboxamides===
[[File:Carbamazepine 3D.png|thumb|right|Carbamazepine]]
{{main|Carboxamide}}
The following are carboxamides:

* [[Carbamazepine]] (1963). A popular anticonvulsant that is available in generic formulations.
* [[Oxcarbazepine]] (1990). A derivative of carbamazepine that has similar efficacy but is better tolerated and is also available generically.
* [[Eslicarbazepine acetate]] (2009)

===Fatty acids===
{{main|Fatty acid}}
The following are fatty-acids:
* The [[valproic acid|valproates]] &mdash; [[valproic acid]], [[sodium valproate]], and [[divalproex sodium]] (1967).
* [[Vigabatrin]] (1989).
* [[Progabide]]
* [[Tiagabine]] (1996).

''Vigabatrin and progabide are also analogs of GABA.''

===Fructose derivatives===

==History==
The first anticonvulsant was [[bromide]], suggested in 1857 by Charles Locock who used it to treat women with "hysterical epilepsy" (probably ''catamenial epilepsy''). Bromides are effective against epilepsy, and also cause impotence, which is not related to its anti-epileptic effects. Bromide also suffered from the way it affected behaviour, introducing the idea of the 'epileptic personality' which was actually a result of medication.  [[Phenobarbital]] was first used in 1912 for both its sedative and antiepileptic properties. By the 1930s, the development of animal models in epilepsy research led to the development of [[phenytoin]] by Tracy Putnam and [[H. Houston Merritt]], which had the distinct advantage of treating epileptic seizures with less sedation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eadie MJ, Bladin PF |year=2001 |title=A Disease Once Sacred: a History of the Medical Understanding of Epilepsy}}</ref> By the 1970s, an National Institutes of Health initiative, the Anticonvulsant Screening Program, headed by [[J. Kiffin Penry]], served as a mechanism for drawing the interest and abilities of pharmaceutical companies in the development of new anticonvulsant medications.

===Marketing approval history===

The following table lists anticonvulsant drugs together with the date their marketing was approved in the US, UK and France. Data for the UK and France are incomplete. In recent years, the [[European Medicines Agency]] has approved drugs throughout the [[European Union]]. Some of the drugs are no longer marketed.

==Use in pregnancy==
During pregnancy, the metabolism of several anticonvulsants is affected. There may be an increase in the clearance and resultant decrease in the blood concentration of lamotrigine, phenytoin, and to a lesser extent carbamazepine, and possibly decreases the level of levetiracetam and the active oxcarbazepine metabolite, the monohydroxy derivative.<ref name=Harden>{{cite journal |author=Harden CL, Pennell PB, Koppel BS, ''et al.'' |title=Management issues for women with epilepsy--focus on pregnancy (an evidence-based review): III.

Taking valproic acid or divalproex sodium during pregnancy should be cautioned against, as this class of medications has been linked to birth defects (teratogenic).

There is inadequate evidence to determine if newborns of women with epilepsy taking anticonvulsants have a substantially increased risk of [[hemorrhagic disease of the newborn]].<ref name=Harden/>

Regarding [[breastfeeding]], some anticonvulsants probably pass into [[breast milk]] in clinically significant amounts, including primidone and levetiracetam.<ref name=Harden/> On the other hand, valproate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine probably are not transferred into breast milk in clinically important amounts.<ref name=Harden/>

In animal models, several anticonvulsant drugs have been demonstrated to induce neuronal [[apoptosis]] in the developing brain.<ref name=Bittigau>{{cite journal |author=Bittigau P, Sifringer M, Genz K,''et al.'' |title=Antiepileptic drugs and apoptotic neurodegenereation in the developing brain|journal=Proc Natl Acad SCI USA |volume=99 |issue=23 |pages=15089–94 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=12417760 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.222550499|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC137548 |pmc=137548}}</ref><ref name=Manthey>{{cite journal |author=Manthey D, Asimiadou S, et al.|title=Sulthiame but not levetiracetam exerts neurotoxic effect in the developing rat brain.|journal=Exp Neurol|volume=193 |issue=2 |pages=497–503 |year=2005 |month=Jun |pmid=15869952 |doi= 10.1016/j.expneurol.2005.01.006|url=}}</ref><ref name=Katz>{{cite journal |author=Katz I, Kim J, et al.|title=Effects of lamotrigine alone and in combination with MK-801, phenobarbital, or phenytoin on cell death in the neonatal rat brain.|journal=J Pharmacol Exp Ther |volume=322 |issue=2 |pages=494–500|year=2007 |month=Aug |pmid=17483293 |doi= 10.1124/jpet.107.123133|url=}}</ref><ref name=Kim>{{cite journal |author=Kim J, Kondratyev A, and Gale K |title=Antiepileptic drug-induced neuronal cell death in the immature brain: effects of carbamazepine, topiramate, and levetiracetam as monotherapy versus polytherapy.|journal=J Pharmacol Exp Ther |volume=323 |issue=1 |pages=165–73|year=2007 |month=Oct |pmid=17636003 |doi= 10.1124/jpet.107.126250|url= |pmc=2789311}}</ref><ref name=Forcelli>{{cite journal |author=Forcelli PA, Kim J "et al."'' |title=Pattern of antiepileptic drug-induced cell death in limbic regions of the neonatal rat brain|journal=Epilepsia |volume=52 |issue=12 |pages=e207–11 |year=2011 |month=Dec |pmid=22050285 |doi= 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03297.x |pmc=3230752 |url=}}</ref>
