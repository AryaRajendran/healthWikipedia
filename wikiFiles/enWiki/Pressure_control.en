'''Pressure control''' ('''PC''') is a [[mode of mechanical ventilation]] alone and a variable within other modes of mechanical ventilation.  Pressure control is used to regulate pressures applied during [[mechanical ventilation]].  Air delivered into the patients lungs (breaths) are currently regulated by [[Volume Control]] or Pressure Control.  In pressure controlled breaths a tidal volume achieved is based on how much volume can be delivered before the pressure control limit is reached.<ref name="pmid10980100">{{cite journal| author=Kallet RH, Campbell AR, Alonso JA, Morabito DJ, Mackersie RC| title=The effects of pressure control versus volume control assisted ventilation on patient work of breathing in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. | journal=Respir Care | year= 2000 | volume= 45 | issue= 9 | pages= 1085–96 | pmid=10980100 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref>

==Uses==
Pressure control is used in any situation where [[pulmonary barotrauma]] may occur such as [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]].<ref name="pmid10980100"/>

== Characteristics ==
* '''Type of breath''' — Only mandatory breaths are available to the patient in the pressure control mode in CMV. In PC-IMV the patient may breathe spontaneously but will get a [[pressure support|pressure supported breath]] with [[PEEP]] rather than a mandatory breath.
* '''Triggering mechanism''' — The mandatory breaths in the pressure control mode are time triggered by a preset rate.
* '''Cycling mechanism''' — The mandatory breaths are time cycled by a preset inspiratory time.
