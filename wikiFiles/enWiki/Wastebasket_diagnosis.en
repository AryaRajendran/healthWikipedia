A '''trashcan diagnosis''' or '''wastebasket diagnosis''' is a vague or fake medical or psychiatric [[diagnosis]] given to a patient or to medical records department for essentially non-medical reasons.<ref name="trashcan diagnosis">{{cite web |url=http://patients.about.com/od/glossary/g/trashcandx.htm |title=trashcan diagnosis |accessdate= 2008-03-29}}</ref> It may be given when the patient has an obvious but unidentifiable medical problem, when a doctor wants to reassure an anxious patient about the doctor's belief in the existence of reported symptoms, when a patient pressures a doctor for a label, or when a doctor wants to facilitate bureaucratic approval of treatment.

==Specific diagnoses==
Many [[alternative medicine]] diagnoses, such as [[Candidiasis|candida]] overgrowth and [[multiple chemical sensitivities]], are considered trashcan diagnoses by medical personnel.

Diagnoses which include a wide variety of complaints and symptoms are particularly prone to being used as trashcan diagnoses, as well as diseases with variable presentations. For example, [[fibromyalgia]] has been used as a trashcan diagnosis to describe [[chronic pain]].<ref name="When the Disease Eludes a Diagnosis">{{cite web |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/25/health/views/25case.html |title=When the Disease Eludes a Diagnosis |accessdate=2008-03-29 |author=Barron H. Lerner, MD |date=25 March 2008 |publisher=New York Times |quote=For example, many patients with chest pain carry a diagnosis of costochondritis (inflammation of the chest wall bones) or gastroesophageal reflux (regurgitation of stomach acid into the esophagus). These are real conditions. But they tend to generate little interest from many physicians, who may refer to them as 'wastebasket diagnoses,' offered when nothing more serious has turned up. The frustration of patients who believe that the medical profession takes these types of ailments too lightly has led groups of them to form alliances to publicize their illnesses. Foremost among them are fibromyalgia, a syndrome involving muscular and other pains, and chronic fatigue syndrome...}}</ref> [[Costochondritis]], [[gastroesophageal reflux]], and [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] are all commonly used as trashcan diagnoses.<ref name="When the Disease Eludes a Diagnosis"/> [[Bronchitis]] may be used as a trashcan diagnosis to label sick children.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=LGOB8BJBKkoC&pg=PA145&lpg=PA145&dq=trashcan+diagnosis+-overgeneralise&source=web&ots=avPkLct3Xd&sig=4Hy_u_5LdJyP-ijIxX8zVOW4axA</ref> [[Reactive hypoglycemia]] has been used as a trashcan diagnosis for people who complain about normal physiological reactions to being hungry. In these cases, the labels are offered when nothing more serious can be identified.<ref name="When the Disease Eludes a Diagnosis"/>

Some diagnoses are being used as trashcan diagnoses in response to unintentional incentives. For example, government-run schools in the United States get additional funding for providing services to students with [[autism spectrum disorder|autism spectrum disorders]], so some children with atypical behavior patterns are labeled as having ASD so the school can more easily obtain funding for special education services.<ref>{{cite news |title=Autism 'epidemic' largely fueled by special ed funding, shift in diagnosing |author=Stobb, Mike |url= http://www.autismtoday.com/articles/Autism%20%27epidemic%27%20largely%20fueled.asp?cat=1 |quote=The recent explosion of cases appears to be mostly caused by a surge in special education services for autistic children, and by a corresponding shift in what doctors call autism. |year=2007}}</ref>

==History==
Fake diagnoses are not a modern invention. Medicine around the world has a long history of using and abusing the concept of trashcan diagnoses, from "rectifying the humors" to [[wikt:marthambles|marthambles]] to [[neurasthenia]] to garbled Latin-sounding names which were made up to impress the patient's family.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=C.J.S. |title=Quacks of Old London |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=B0F_si1EBgYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |format= |accessdate=February 11, 2012 |date=January 24, 2003 |origyear=1928 |publisher= Kessinger Publishing |location= |isbn=978-0-7661-3609-0 |oclc= |page=80}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Lobscouse & Spotted Dog: Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the Aubrey |author= Grossman, Anne Chotzinoff, Lisa Grossman Thomas, Patrick O'Brian |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-393-32094-7 |pages=249–250}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Social history of language |author= Burke, Peter and Roy Porter |pages=89–90 |isbn=978-0-521-31763-4}}</ref>
