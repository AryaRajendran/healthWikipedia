As a measure of its influence on the accounting industry, the [[AICPA]]'s ''[[Journal of Accountancy]]'' estimated that as many as half of the CPAs in the United States have passed the CPA Exam with the help of Becker's course.<ref name="Journal of Accountancy — Newt Becker Obit">{{cite news|last=Tysiac|first=Ken|title=CPA exam prep innovator Newton D.

Originally developed in 1957 by accountant and entrepreneur Newt Becker as a training course for fellow employees of [[Price Waterhouse]], Becker CPA Review was launched as an independent company in 1960. The company grew rapidly, and by the 1980s it had classroom locations in more than 90 cities.<ref name="Sun-Times — Exam Programs" /> Newt Becker eventually sold the company to DeVry in 1996, partly due to changes in the industry.<ref name="Journal of Accountancy — Newt Becker Obit" /><ref name="Chicago Tribune — DeVry Acquisition">{{cite news|last=Ziemba|first=Stanley|title=DeVry Acquires CPA Training Firm|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-06-20/business/9606200247_1_becker-cpa-review-devry-acquires|accessdate=June 20, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=June 20, 1996}}</ref>

In addition to its CPA Exam Review, Becker currently offers exam preparation for a number of other international accounting credentials: [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA), [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] (CIMA), and Diploma in International Financial Reporting (DipIFR) certifications. Becker also provides [[continuing professional education]] (CPE) and project management training. 

In 2012, Becker acquired Falcon Physician Reviews and expanded into the healthcare education field.<ref name="NASDAQ — Falcon Acquisition">{{cite news|title=DeVry Unit Acquires Falcon Physician Reviews|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/devry-unit-acquires-falcon-physician-reviews-20120403-01222|accessdate=June 20, 2012|newspaper=NASDAQ.com|date=April 3, 2012}}</ref>  Through Falcon, Becker now offers review programs for physicians who are preparing for the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination]] (USMLE) and the [[Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination]](COMLEX).
