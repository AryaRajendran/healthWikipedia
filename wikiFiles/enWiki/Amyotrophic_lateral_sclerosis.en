'''Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis''' ('''ALS''') – also referred to as '''motor neurone disease''' in some [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries and as '''[[Lou Gehrig]]'s disease''' in the [[United States]]&nbsp;– is a debilitating disease with varied [[etiology (medicine)|etiology]] characterized by rapidly progressive weakness, [[muscle atrophy]] and [[fasciculations]], muscle [[spasticity]], difficulty speaking ([[dysarthria]]), difficulty swallowing ([[dysphagia]]), and difficulty breathing ([[dyspnea]]). ALS is the most common of the five [[motor neuron disease]]s.

==Signs and symptoms==
The disorder causes muscle weakness and atrophy throughout the body caused by the degeneration of the [[upper motor neuron|upper]] and [[lower motor neuron]]s. Unable to function, the muscles weaken and [[atrophy]]. Individuals affected by the disorder may ultimately lose the ability to initiate and control all voluntary movement, although bladder and bowel sphincters and the muscles responsible for eye movement are usually, but not always, spared until the terminal stages of the disease.<ref name="PubMed Health">{{cite web |title=Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis |work=A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia |date=27 August 2010 |author=Dugdale DC, Hoch DB, Zieve D |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001708/}}</ref>

Cognitive function is generally spared for most patients, although some (about 5%) also have [[frontotemporal dementia]].<ref name="pmid17945153">{{cite journal |author=Phukan J, Pender NP, Hardiman O |title=Cognitive impairment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=994–1003 |year=2007 |pmid=17945153 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(07)70265-X |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1474-4422(07)70265-X}}</ref> A higher proportion of patients (30–50%) also have more subtle cognitive changes which may go unnoticed, but are revealed by detailed [[neuropsychological testing]]. Sensory nerves and the [[autonomic nervous system]] are generally unaffected, meaning the majority of people with ALS will maintain hearing, sight, touch, smell, and taste.

===Initial symptoms===
The earliest symptoms of ALS are typically obvious weakness and/or muscle atrophy. Other presenting symptoms include muscle fasciculation (twitching), cramping, or stiffness of affected muscles; muscle weakness affecting an arm or a leg; and/or slurred and nasal speech. The parts of the body affected by early symptoms of ALS depend on which motor neurons in the body are damaged first. About 75% of people contracting the disease experience "limb onset" ALS, ''i.e.'', first symptoms in the arms or legs. Patients with the leg onset form may experience awkwardness when walking or running or notice that they are tripping or stumbling, often with a "dropped foot" which drags gently along the ground. Arm-onset patients may experience difficulty with tasks requiring manual dexterity such as buttoning a shirt, writing, or turning a key in a lock. Occasionally, the symptoms remain confined to one limb for a long period of time or for the whole length of the illness; this is known as [[monomelic amyotrophy]].

About 25% of cases are "[[bulbar]] onset" ALS. These patients first notice difficulty speaking clearly or swallowing. Speech may become slurred, nasal in character, or quieter. Other symptoms include difficulty swallowing and loss of tongue mobility. A smaller proportion of patients experience "respiratory onset" ALS, where the [[intercostal]] muscles that support breathing are affected first. A small proportion of patients may also present with what appears to be [[frontotemporal dementia]], but later progresses to include more typical ALS symptoms.

Over time, patients experience increasing difficulty moving, swallowing ([[dysphagia]]), and speaking or forming words ([[dysarthria]]). Symptoms of upper motor neuron involvement include tight and stiff muscles ([[spasticity]]) and exaggerated reflexes ([[hyperreflexia]]) including an overactive gag reflex. An abnormal reflex commonly called [[Plantar reflex|Babinski's sign]] also indicates upper motor neuron damage. Symptoms of lower motor neuron degeneration include muscle weakness and atrophy, muscle cramps, and fleeting twitches of muscles that can be seen under the skin (fasciculations). Around 15–45% of patients experience [[pseudobulbar affect]], also known as "emotional lability", which consists of uncontrollable laughter, crying or smiling, attributable to degeneration of bulbar upper motor neurons resulting in exaggeration of motor expressions of emotion. To be diagnosed with ALS, patients must have signs and symptoms of both upper and lower motor neuron damage that cannot be attributed to other causes.

===Disease progression and spread===
Although the order and rate of symptoms varies from person to person, eventually most patients are not able to walk, get out of bed on their own, or use their hands and arms. The rate of progression can be measured using an outcome measure called the "ALS Functional Rating Scale (Revised)", a 12-item instrument administered as a clinical interview or patient-reported questionnaire that produces a score between 48 (normal function) and 0 (severe disability). Though there is a high degree of variability and a small percentage of patients have much slower disease, on average, patients lose about 1 FRS point per month. Regardless of the part of the body first affected by the disease, muscle weakness and atrophy spread to other parts of the body as the disease progresses. In limb-onset ALS, symptoms usually spread from the affected limb to the opposite limb before affecting a new body region, whereas in bulbar-onset ALS symptoms typically spread to the arms before the legs.

Disease progression tends to be slower in patients who are younger than 40 at onset,<ref>{{cite doi|10.1212/01.wnl.0000312378.94737.45}}</ref> have disease restricted primarily to one limb, and those with primarily upper motor neuron symptoms.<ref name="pmid21402743">{{cite doi|10.1136/jnnp.2010.235952}}</ref> Conversely, progression is faster and prognosis poorer in patients with bulbar-onset disease, respiratory-onset disease, and frontotemporal dementia.<ref name="pmid21402743" />

===Late stage disease symptoms===
Difficulty swallowing and chewing make eating normally very difficult and increase the risk of choking or aspirating food into the lungs. In later stages of the disease, aspiration pneumonia and maintaining a healthy weight can become a significant problem and may require insertion of a feeding tube. As the diaphragm and [[intercostal muscle]]s (rib cage) that support breathing weaken, measures of lung function such as forced vital capacity and inspiratory pressure diminish. In respiratory onset ALS, this may occur before significant limb weakness is apparent. External machines such as bilevel positive pressure ventilation (frequently referred to by the tradename [[BiPAP]]) are frequently used to support breathing, first at night, and later during the daytime as well. BiPAP is only a temporary remedy, however, and it is recommended that long before BiPAP stops being effective, patients should decide whether to have a [[tracheotomy]] and long term mechanical ventilation. At this point, some patients choose [[Palliative care|palliative hospice care]]. Most people with ALS die of respiratory failure or [[pneumonia]].

Although respiratory support can ease problems with breathing and prolong survival, it does not affect the progression of ALS. Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure, usually within three to five years from the onset of symptoms. The median survival time from onset to death is around 39 months, and only 4% survive longer than 10 years.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Turner MR, Parton MJ, Shaw CE, Leigh PN, Al-Chalabi A| title = Prolonged survival in motor neuron disease: a descriptive study of the King's database 1990–2002 | journal = J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry | year = 2003 | volume = 74 | pages = 995–997 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.74.7.995 | pmid = 12810805 | issue = 7 | pmc = 1738535 }}</ref> The best-known person with ALS, [[Stephen Hawking]], has lived with the disease for more than 50 years, though his is an unusual case.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-04-20/health/hawking.als_1_als-association-lou-gehrig-s-disease-motor-neuron-disease?_s=PM:HEALTH |title=Stephen Hawking serves as role model for ALS patients |publisher=CNN |date=2009-04-20 }}</ref>

==Cause==

===Genetic factors===

There is a known hereditary factor in familial ALS (FALS), where the condition is known to run in families. A defect on chromosome 21, which codes for [[superoxide dismutase]], is associated with approximately 20% of familial cases of ALS, or about 2% of ALS cases overall.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Conwit|first=Robin A. |title=Preventing familial ALS: A clinical trial may be feasible but is an efficacy trial warranted? |journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences |year=2006 |month=December |volume=251 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–2 |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2006.07.009 |issn=0022-510X |pmid=17070848}}</ref><ref name="advances">{{cite journal |last=Al-Chalabi |first=Ammar |coauthor=P.

In 2011, a genetic abnormality known as a hexanucleotide repeat was found in a region called [[C9orf72|C9ORF72]], which is associated with ALS combined with frontotemporal dementia ALS-FTD,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Dejesus-Hernandez, M., et al., | title = Expanded GGGGCC Hexanucleotide Repeat in Noncoding Region of C9ORF72 Causes Chromosome 9p-Linked FTD and ALS | journal = Neuron | year = 2011 | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | pages = 245–56 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2011.09.011 | pmid = 21944778 | url = http://download.cell.com/neuron/pdf/PIIS0896627311008282.pdf | pmc = 3202986 }}</ref> and accounts for some 6% of cases of ALS among white Europeans.<ref>{{cite journal | author =Majounie E., et al. | title = Frequency of the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia: a cross-sectional study | journal = Lancet Neurology | year = 2012 | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 323–330 | doi = 10.1016/S1474-4422(12)70043-1 | pmid =22406228 | pmc =3322422 }}</ref> The high degree of mutations found in patients that appeared to have "sporadic" disease, (''i.e.,'' without a family history) suggests that genetics may play a more significant role than previously thought and that environmental exposures may be less relevant.

To date, a number of genetic mutations have been associated with various types of ALS. The currently known associations are as follows:

====''SOD1''====
The precise cause of ALS is not known, though an important step toward determining the cause came in 1993 when scientists discovered that mutations in the gene that produces the Cu/Zn [[superoxide dismutase]] ([[SOD1]]) enzyme were associated with some cases (approximately 20%) of familial ALS. This enzyme is a powerful [[antioxidant]] that protects the body from damage caused by [[superoxide]], a toxic free radical generated in the mitochondria. [[Free radicals]] are highly reactive molecules produced by cells during normal [[metabolism]]. Free radicals can accumulate and cause damage to both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA and proteins within cells. To date, over 110 different mutations in SOD1 have been linked with the disease, some of which have a very long clinical course (e.g. [[H46R]]), while others, such as [[A4V]], being exceptionally aggressive. Evidence suggests that failure of defenses against oxidative stress up-regulates programmed cell death (apoptosis), among many other possible consequences. Although it is not yet clear how the SOD1 gene mutation leads to motor neuron degeneration, researchers have theorized that an accumulation of free radicals may result from the faulty functioning of this gene. Current research, however, indicates that motor neuron death is not likely a result of lost or compromised dismutase activity, suggesting mutant SOD1 induces toxicity in some other way (a gain of function).<ref name="mSOD1 gene deletion does not cause MND">{{cite journal |author=Reaume A, Elliott J, Hoffman E, Kowall N, Ferrante R, Siwek D, Wilcox H, Flood D, Beal M, Brown R, Scott R, Snider W |title=Motor neurons in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-deficient mice develop normally but exhibit enhanced cell death after axonal injury |journal=Nat Genet |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=43–7 |year=1996 |pmid=8673102 |doi=10.1038/ng0596-43}}</ref><ref name="wtSOD1 elevatation/elimination do not change disease course">{{cite journal |author=Bruijn L, Houseweart M, Kato S, Anderson K, Anderson S, Ohama E, Reaume A, Scott R, Cleveland D |title=Aggregation and motor neuron toxicity of an ALS-linked SOD1 mutant independent from wild-type SOD1 |journal=Science |volume=281 |issue=5384 |pages=1851–4 |year=1998 |pmid=9743498 |doi=10.1126/science.281.5384.1851}}</ref>

Studies involving [[transgenic]] mice have yielded several theories about the role of SOD1 in mutant SOD1 familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Mice lacking the SOD1 gene entirely do not customarily develop ALS, although they do exhibit an acceleration of age-related muscle atrophy ([[sarcopenia]]) and a shortened lifespan (see article on [[superoxide dismutase]]). This indicates that the toxic properties of the mutant SOD1 are a result of a gain in function rather than a loss of normal function. In addition, aggregation of proteins has been found to be a common pathological feature of both familial and sporadic ALS (see article on [[proteopathy]]). Interestingly, in mutant SOD1 mice (most commonly, the [[G93A]] mutant), aggregates (misfolded protein accumulations) of mutant SOD1 were found only in diseased tissues, and greater amounts were detected during motor neuron degeneration.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Furukawa Y, Fu R, Deng H, Siddique T, O'Halloran T |title=Disulfide cross-linked protein represents a significant fraction of ALS-associated Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase aggregates in spinal cords of model mice |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=103 |issue=18 |pages=7148–53 |year=2006 |pmid=16636274 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0602048103 |pmc=1447524}}</ref> It is speculated that aggregate accumulation of mutant SOD1 plays a role in disrupting cellular functions by damaging [[mitochondria]], [[proteasomes]], protein folding [[chaperone (protein)|chaperones]], or other proteins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Boillée S, Vande Velde C, Cleveland D |title=ALS: a disease of motor neurons and their nonneuronal neighbors |journal=Neuron |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=39–59 |year=2006 |pmid=17015226 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2006.09.018}}</ref> Any such disruption, if proven, would lend significant credibility to the theory that aggregates are involved in mutant SOD1 toxicity. Critics have noted that in humans, SOD1 mutations cause only 2% or so of overall cases and the etiological mechanisms may be distinct from those responsible for the sporadic form of the disease. To date, the ALS-SOD1 mice remain the best model of the disease for preclinical studies but it is hoped that more useful models will be developed.

===Other factors===
Where no family history of the disease is present&nbsp;– i.e., in around 95% of cases&nbsp;– there is no known cause for ALS. Potential causes for which there is inconclusive evidence includes head trauma, military service, and participation in contact sports.

Studies also have focused on the role of [[glutamate]] in motor neuron degeneration. Glutamate is one of the chemical messengers or [[neurotransmitters]] in the brain. Scientists have found that, compared to healthy people, ALS patients have higher levels of glutamate in the [[blood plasma|serum]] and spinal fluid.<ref name="advances" /> [[Riluzole]] is currently the only FDA approved drug for ALS and targets glutamate transporters. It only has a modest effect on survival, however, suggesting that excess glutamate is not the sole cause of the disease.

Certain studies suggested a link between sporadic ALS, specifically in athletes, and a diet enriched with [[branched-chain amino acid]]s. BCAAs, a common dietary supplement among athletes, cause cell hyper-excitability resembling that usually observed in ALS patients. The proposed underlying mechanism is that cell hyper-excitability results in increased calcium absorption by the cell and thus brings about cell death, specifically of neuronal cells which have particularly low calcium buffering capabilities.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.expneurol.2010.12.007}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.expneurol.2010.08.033}}</ref>

According to [[Medical News Today]], "A group of investigators from the [[University of British Columbia]] and the [[Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute]] have discovered a crucial link between [[prion]]s and the neurodegenerative disease ALS" <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/234813.php |title=Crucial Link Between Prions And ALS Discovered - May Transform Treatment |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=22 Sep 2011 |work= |publisher=[[Medical News Today]] |accessdate=21 December 2012}}</ref>

Many other potential causes, including chemical exposure, electromagnetic field exposure, occupation, physical trauma, and electric shock, have been investigated but without consistent findings.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sutedja NA, Fischer K, Veldink JH, van der Heijden GJ, Kromhout H, Heederik D, et al. | title = What we truly know about occupation as a risk factor for ALS: a critical and systematic review | journal = Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis | year = 2009 | volume = 10 |pages = 295–301 | doi = 10.3109/17482960802430799 | pmid = 19922116 | issue = 5–6 }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
The defining feature of ALS is the death of both upper and lower motor neurons in the motor cortex of the brain, the brain stem, and the spinal cord. Prior to their destruction, motor neurons develop proteinaceous [[inclusion bodies|inclusions]] in their cell bodies and [[axon]]s. This may be partly due to defects in protein degradation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Deng|first=HX|coauthors=Chen, W, Hong, ST, Boycott, KM, Gorrie, GH, Siddique, N, Yang, Y, Fecto, F, Shi, Y, Zhai, H, Jiang, H, Hirano, M, Rampersaud, E, Jansen, GH, Donkervoort, S, Bigio, EH, Brooks, BR, Ajroud, K, Sufit, RL, Haines, JL, Mugnaini, E, Pericak-Vance, MA, Siddique, T|title=Mutations in UBQLN2 cause dominant X-linked juvenile and adult onset ALS and ALS/dementia|journal=Nature|date=2011-08-21|pmid=21857683|doi=10.1038/nature10353|volume=477|issue=7363|pages=211–5|pmc=3169705}}</ref> These inclusions often contain [[ubiquitin]], and generally incorporate one of the ALS-associated proteins: [[SOD1]], [[TDP-43|TAR DNA binding protein]] (TDP-43, or TARDBP), or [[FUS]].

==Diagnosis==
No test can provide a definite diagnosis of ALS, although the presence of upper and lower motor neuron signs in a single limb is strongly suggestive. Instead, the diagnosis of ALS is primarily based on the symptoms and signs the physician observes in the patient and a series of tests to rule out other diseases. Physicians obtain the patient's full medical history and usually conduct a neurologic examination at regular intervals to assess whether symptoms such as muscle weakness, atrophy of muscles, hyperreflexia, and spasticity are getting progressively worse.

[[File:ALS cross.jpg|thumb|MRI (axial FLAIR) demonstrates increased T2 signal within the posterior part of the internal capsule, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of ALS.]]
Because symptoms of ALS can be similar to those of a wide variety of other, more treatable diseases or disorders, appropriate tests must be conducted to exclude the possibility of other conditions. One of these tests is [[electromyography]] (EMG), a special recording technique that detects electrical activity in muscles. Certain EMG findings can support the diagnosis of ALS. Another common test measures [[nerve conduction velocity]] (NCV). Specific abnormalities in the NCV results may suggest, for example, that the patient has a form of [[peripheral neuropathy]] (damage to peripheral nerves) or [[myopathy]] (muscle disease) rather than ALS. The physician may order [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), a noninvasive procedure that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to take detailed images of the brain and spinal cord. Although these MRI scans are often normal in patients with ALS, they can reveal evidence of other problems that may be causing the symptoms, such as a spinal cord tumor, [[multiple sclerosis]], a [[hernia]]ted disk in the neck, [[syringomyelia]], or cervical [[spondylosis]].

Based on the patient's symptoms and findings from the examination and from these tests, the physician may order tests on blood and [[urine]] samples to eliminate the possibility of other diseases as well as routine laboratory tests. In some cases, for example, if a physician suspects that the patient may have a myopathy rather than ALS, a muscle biopsy may be performed.

Neurological disorders such as [[multiple sclerosis]], [[post-polio syndrome]], [[multifocal motor neuropathy]], [[CIDP]], and [[spinal muscular atrophy]] can also mimic certain facets of the disease and should be considered by physicians attempting to make a diagnosis.

==Treatment==

===Slowing progression===
[[Riluzole]] (Rilutek) is the only treatment that has been found to improve survival but only to a modest extent.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carlesi|first=C|coauthors=Pasquali, L, Piazza, S, Lo Gerfo, A, Caldarazzo Ienco, E, Alessi, R, Fornai, F, Siciliano, G|title=Strategies for clinical approach to neurodegeneration in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|journal=Archives italiennes de biologie|date=March 2011|volume=149|issue=1|pages=151–67|pmid=21412722|doi=10.4449/aib.v149i1.1267}}</ref> It lengthens survival by several months, and may have a greater survival benefit for those with a bulbar onset. It also extends the time before a person needs ventilation support. Riluzole does not reverse the damage already done to motor neurons, and people taking it must be monitored for liver damage (occurring in ~10% of people taking the drug).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=RG|coauthors=Mitchell JD, Lyon M, Moore DH, G|title=Riluzole for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND)|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2007|issue=1|pmid=17253460|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001447.pub2|editor1-last=Miller|editor1-first=Robert G|pages=CD001447}}</ref> It is approved by [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and recommended by the [[National Institute for Clinical Excellence]] (NICE).

===Disease management===
Other treatments for ALS are designed to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients. This supportive care is best provided by multidisciplinary teams of health care professionals working with patients and caregivers to keep patients as mobile and comfortable as possible.

====Pharmaceutical treatments====
Medical professionals can prescribe medications to help reduce fatigue, ease muscle cramps, control [[spasticity]], and reduce excess [[saliva]] and [[phlegm]]. Drugs also are available to help patients with pain, depression, sleep disturbances, [[dysphagia]], and [[constipation]].  [[Baclofen]] and [[diazepam]] are often prescribed to control the spasticity caused by ALS, and [[trihexyphenidyl]] or [[amitriptyline]] may be prescribed when ALS patients begin having trouble swallowing their saliva.<ref name="PubMed Health"/>

====Physical, occupational and speech therapy====
[[Physical therapists]] and [[occupational therapists]] play a large role in rehabilitation for individuals with ALS. Specifically, physical and occupational therapists can set goals and promote benefits for individuals with ALS by delaying loss of strength, maintaining endurance, limiting pain, preventing complications, and promoting functional independence.<ref name="Lewis & Rushanan">{{cite journal|author=Lewis, M. & Rushanan, S.|title=The role of physical therapy and occupational therapy in the treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis|journal=NeuroRehabilitation|year=2007|volume=22 |pages=451–461|pmid=18198431|issue=6}}</ref>

Occupational therapy and special equipment such as [[assistive technology]] can also enhance patients' independence and safety throughout the course of ALS. Gentle, low-impact [[aerobic exercise]] such as performing activities of daily living (ADL's), walking, swimming, and [[Exercise bicycle|stationary bicycling]] can strengthen unaffected muscles, improve cardiovascular health, and help patients fight fatigue and depression. Range of motion and stretching exercises can help prevent painful spasticity and shortening (contracture) of muscles. Physical and occupational therapists can recommend exercises that provide these benefits without overworking muscles. They can suggest devices such as ramps, braces, walkers, bathroom equipment (shower chairs, toilet risers, etc.) and wheelchairs that help patients remain mobile. Occupational therapists can provide or recommend equipment and adaptations to enable people to retain as much safety and independence in activities of daily living as possible.

ALS patients who have difficulty speaking may benefit from working with a [[speech-language pathologist]]. These health professionals can teach patients adaptive strategies such as techniques to help them speak louder and more clearly. As ALS progresses, speech-language pathologists can recommend the use of [[augmentative and alternative communication]] such as voice amplifiers, speech-generating devices (or voice output communication devices) and/or low tech communication techniques such as [[letter board|alphabet boards]] or yes/no signals.

====Feeding and nutrition====
Patients and caregivers can learn from speech-language pathologists and nutritionists how to plan and prepare numerous small meals throughout the day that provide enough calories, fiber, and fluid and how to avoid foods that are difficult to swallow. Patients may begin using suction devices to remove excess fluids or saliva and prevent choking. Occupational therapists can assist with recommendations for adaptive equipment to ease the physical task of self-feeding and/or make food choice recommendations that are more conducive to their unique deficits and abilities. When patients can no longer get enough nourishment from eating, doctors may advise inserting a feeding tube into the stomach. The use of a feeding tube also reduces the risk of choking and pneumonia that can result from inhaling liquids into the lungs. The tube is not painful and does not prevent patients from eating food orally if they wish.

Researchers have stated that "ALS patients have a chronically deficient intake of energy and recommended augmentation of energy intake."<ref name=Kasarskis96/> Both animal<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hamadeh MJ, Rodriguez MC, Kaczor JJ, Tarnopolsky MA |title=Caloric restriction transiently improves motor performance but hastens clinical onset of disease in the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase mutant G93A mouse |journal=Muscle Nerve |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=214–20 |year=2005 |month=Feb |pmid=15625688 |doi=10.1002/mus.20255 }}</ref> and human research<ref name=Kasarskis96>{{cite journal |author=Kasarskis EJ, Berryman S, Vanderleest JG, Schneider AR, McClain CJ |title=Nutritional status of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: relation to the proximity of death |journal=Am J Clin Nutr. |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=130–7 |year=1996 |month=Jan |pmid=8604660 |doi= |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8604660}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Slowie LA, Paige MS, Antel JP |title=Nutritional considerations in the management of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) |journal=J Am Diet Assoc |volume=83 |issue=1 |pages=44–7 |year=1983 |month=Jul |pmid=6863783 }}</ref> suggest that ALS patients should be encouraged to consume as many calories as possible and not to restrict their calorie intake.

====Breathing support====
When the muscles that assist in breathing weaken, use of ventilatory assistance ([[intermittent positive pressure ventilation]] (IPPV), [[bilevel positive airway pressure]] (BIPAP), or [[Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation|biphasic cuirass ventilation]] (BCV)) may be used to aid breathing. Such devices artificially inflate the patient's lungs from various external sources that are applied directly to the face or body. When muscles are no longer able to maintain oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, these devices may be used full-time. BCV has the added advantage of being able to assist in clearing secretions by using high-frequency oscillations followed by several positive expiratory breaths.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sviri S, Linton DM, Van Heerden PV |title= Non-invasive Mechanical Ventilation Enhances Patient Autonomy in Decision-Making Regarding Chronic Ventilation |journal=Critical Care and Resuscitation
 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=116–118 |year=2005 |month=Jun |pmid=16548804 |doi=}}</ref> Patients may eventually consider forms of mechanical ventilation (respirators) in which a machine inflates and deflates the lungs. To be effective, this may require a tube that passes from the nose or mouth to the windpipe ([[vertebrate trachea|trachea]]) and for long-term use, an operation such as a [[tracheostomy]], in which a plastic [[Tracheal tube|breathing tube]] is inserted directly in the patient's windpipe through an opening in the neck.

Patients and their families should consider several factors when deciding whether and when to use one of these options. Ventilation devices differ in their effect on the patient's quality of life and in cost. Although ventilation support can ease problems with breathing and prolong survival, it does not affect the progression of ALS. Patients need to be fully informed about these considerations and the long-term effects of life without movement before they make decisions about ventilation support. Some patients under long-term tracheostomy intermittent positive pressure ventilation with deflated cuffs or cuffless tracheostomy tubes (leak ventilation) are able to speak, provided their bulbar muscles are strong enough. This technique preserves speech in some patients with long-term mechanical ventilation. Other patients may be able to utilize a speaking valve such as a Passey-Muir Speaking Valve with the assistance and guidance of a speech-language pathologist.

====Palliative care====
[[Social workers]] and home care and [[Hospice care|hospice]] nurses help patients, families, and caregivers with the medical, emotional, and financial challenges of coping with ALS, particularly during the final stages of the disease. Social workers provide support such as assistance in obtaining financial aid, arranging durable [[power of attorney]], preparing a [[living will]], and finding support groups for patients and caregivers. Home nurses are available not only to provide medical care but also to teach caregivers about tasks such as maintaining respirators, giving feedings, and moving patients to avoid painful skin problems and contractures. Home hospice nurses work in consultation with physicians to ensure proper medication, pain control, and other care affecting the quality of life of patients who wish to remain at home. The home hospice team can also counsel patients and caregivers about end-of-life issues.

==Epidemiology==
ALS is one of the most common neuromuscular diseases worldwide, and people of all races and ethnic backgrounds are affected. One or two out of 100,000 people develop ALS each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/brain/tc/Amyotrophic-Lateral-Sclerosis-ALS-Topic-Overview |title=ALS Topic Overview |accessdate=2008-05-01| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080501194730/http://www.webmd.com/brain/tc/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als-topic-overview| archivedate= 1 May 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> ALS most commonly strikes people between 40 and 60 years of age, but younger and older people can also develop the disease. Men are affected slightly more often than women.

Although the incidence of ALS is thought to be regionally uniform, there are three regions in the West Pacific where there has in the past been an elevated occurrence of ALS. This seems to be declining in recent decades. The largest is the area of [[Guam]] inhabited by the [[Chamorro people]], who have historically had a high incidence (as much as 143 cases per 100,000 people per year) of a condition called [[Lytico-Bodig disease]] which is a combination of symptoms similar to ALS, parkinsonism, and dementia.  Lytico-Bodig disease has been linked to the consumption of cycad seeds and in particular, the chemical found in cycad seeds, β-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reed D, Labarthe D, Chen KM, Stallones R |title=A cohort study of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and parkinsonism-dementia on Guam and Rota |journal=Am J Epidemiol. |volume=125 |issue=1 |pages=92–100 |year=1987 |month=Jan |pmid=3788958 |url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3788958}}</ref> Two more areas of increased incidence are [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]] and the [[Kii Peninsula]] of Japan.<ref>S.

Although many authors consider ALS to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors, so far the latter have not been firmly identified, other than a higher risk with increasing age.

==Etymology==
''Amyotrophic'' comes from the [[Greek language]]: ''A-'' means "no", ''myo'' refers to "muscle", and ''trophic'' means "nourishment"; ''amyotrophic'' therefore means "no muscle nourishment," which describes the characteristic [[atrophy|atrophication]] of the sufferer's disused muscle tissue. ''Lateral'' identifies the areas in a person's spinal cord where portions of the nerve cells that are affected are located. As this area degenerates it leads to scarring or hardening ("[[Sclerosis (medicine)|sclerosis]]") in the region.

==Clinical research==
A number of clinical trials are underway globally for ALS; a comprehensive listing of trials in the US can be found at [[ClinicalTrials.gov]].

Thalidomide and Lenalidomide have shown efficacy in protecting motor neurons in transgenic (G93A) mice.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=1 March 2006|volume=26|issue=9|pages=2467–2473|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/26/9/2467.full.pdf+html|type=Original article|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5253-05.2006|pmid=16510725|last1=Kiaei|first1=M|last2=Petri|first2=S|last3=Kipiani|first3=K|last4=Gardian|first4=G|last5=Choi|first5=DK|last6=Chen|first6=J|last7=Calingasan|first7=NY|last8=Schafer|first8=P|last9=Muller|first9=GW|title=Thalidomide and lenalidomide extend survival in a transgenic mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}}</ref>

[[KNS-760704]] (Dexpramipexole) is under clinical investigation in ALS patients. It is hoped that the drug will have a neuroprotective effect. It is one [[enantiomer]] of [[pramipexole]], which is approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Abramova NA et al. |title=Inhibition by R(+) or S(-) pramipexole of caspase activation and cell death induced by methylpyridinium ion or beta amyloid peptide in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma |journal=J Neurosci Res |date=2002 Feb 15 |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=494–500 |pmid=11835316|doi=10.1002/jnr.10127 }}</ref> The single-enantiomer preparation is essentially inactive at dopamine receptors, is not dose limited by the potent dopaminergic properties of pramipexole.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1755-5949.2008.00048.x}}</ref> Results of a Phase II clinical trial conducted by Knopp Neurosciences and involving 102 patients were reported in 2010; the trial found a dose-dependent slowing in loss of function.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1097/01.NT.0000384108.10957.21}}</ref> A larger phase II trial conducted by Biogen found the drug to be safe, well tolerated, and associated with a dose-dependent slowing in the decline of ALS.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/nm.2579}}</ref> In January 2013, Biogen Idec announced that it was discontinuing its development of dexpramipexole in ALS due to lack of efficacy in a Phase III study.
