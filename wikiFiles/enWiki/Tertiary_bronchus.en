The '''tertiary bronchi''' (also known as the '''segmental bronchi''') arise from the [[secondary bronchus|secondary bronchi]].  The [[respiratory epithelium]] lining their lumen is surrounded by a layer of [[smooth muscle]].  This layer is composed of two ribbons of smooth muscle that spiral in opposite directions.  The smooth muscle layer is surrounded by irregular plates of [[hyaline cartilage]] which help maintain the patency of the airway.

Each of the tertiary bronchi serves a specific [[bronchopulmonary segment]].  There are 10 tertiary bronchi in the right lung, and eight in the left.

The tertiary bronchi get smaller and divide into [[bronchiole]]s.
