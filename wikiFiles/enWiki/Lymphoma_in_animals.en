'''Lymphoma in animals''' is a type of [[cancer]] defined by a proliferation of [[malignant]] [[lymphocyte]]s within solid organs such as the [[lymph node]]s, [[bone marrow]], [[liver]] and [[spleen]].  The disease also may occur in the [[eye]], [[skin]], and [[gastrointestinal tract]].  It is also known as '''lymphosarcoma'''.

==Lymphoma in dogs==
Lymphoma is one of the most common malignant [[tumor]]s to occur in dogs.  The cause is [[genetics|genetic]], but there are also suspected environmental factors involved,<ref name=Morrison_1998>{{cite book|author=Morrison, Wallace B.|title=Cancer in Dogs and Cats|edition=1st|publisher=Williams and Wilkins|year=1998|isbn=0-683-06105-4}}</ref> including in one study an increased risk with the use of the [[herbicide]] [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid|2,4-D]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zahm S, Blair A |title=Pesticides and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma |journal=Cancer Res |volume=52 |issue=19 Suppl |pages=5485s-5488s |year=1992 |pmid=1394159}}</ref>  This risk was not confirmed in another study.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kaneene J, Miller R |title=Re-analysis of 2,4-D use and the occurrence of canine malignant lymphoma |journal=Vet Hum Toxicol |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=164–70 |year=1999 |pmid=10349709}}</ref>

Breeds that are commonly affected include [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]], [[Scottish Terrier]], [[Basset Hound]], [[Airedale Terrier]], [[Chow Chow]], [[German Shepherd Dog|German Shepherd]], [[Poodle]], [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]], [[Bulldog]], [[Beagle]], [[Rottweiler]]<ref name=Morrison_1998/> and [[Golden Retriever]]. The [[Golden Retriever]] is especially susceptible to developing lymphoma, with a lifetime risk of 1:8.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Modiano J, Breen M, Burnett R, Parker H, Inusah S, Thomas R, Avery P, Lindblad-Toh K, Ostrander E, Cutter G, Avery A |title=Distinct B-cell and T-cell lymphoproliferative disease prevalence among dog breeds indicates heritable risk |journal=Cancer Res |volume=65 |issue=13 |pages=5654–61 |year=2005 |pmid=15994938 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4613}}</ref>

===Classification===
The cancer is classified into low and high [[grading (tumors)|grade]] types.  Classification is also based on location.  The four location types are multicentric, [[mediastinum|mediastinal]], [[gastrointestinal]], and extranodal (involving the kidney, [[central nervous system]], skin, heart, or eye).  Multicentric lymphoma, the most common type (by greater than 80 percent),<ref>{{cite web | title = Canine Malignant Lymphoma: Introduction | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/10500.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-28 }}</ref> is found in the lymph nodes, with or without involvement in the liver, spleen, or bone marrow.  Mediastinal lymphoma occurs in the lymph nodes in the thorax and possibly the [[thymus]].  Gastrointestinal lymphoma occurs as either a solitary tumor or diffuse invasion of the stomach or intestines, with or without involvement in the surrounding lymph nodes, liver or spleen.<ref name=canvet>{{cite journal |author=Lowe A |title=Alimentary lymphosarcoma in a 4-year-old Labrador retriever |journal=Can Vet J |volume=45 |issue=7 |pages=610–2 |year=2004 |pmid=15317395 |pmc=548643}}</ref>  Classification is further based on involvement of [[B cell|B-lymphocytes]] or [[T cell|T-lymphocytes]].  Approximately 70 percent are B-cell lymphoma.<ref>{{cite web|author=Simon, Daniela|year=2006|title=Malignant lymphoma in the dog: Short and long term chemotherapy|work=Proceedings of the North American Veterinary Conference|url=http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/navc/2006/SAE/292.pdf?LA=1|accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref>  Cutaneous lymphoma can be classified as epitheliotropic (closely conforming to the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]) or non-epitheliotropic.  The epitheliotropic form is typically of T-cell origin and is also called [[mycosis fungoides]].  The non-epitheliotropic form is typically of B-cell origin.<ref name=DVMMay>{{cite journal | last = Hoskins | first = Johnny D. | title = Cutaneous paraneoplastic disease | journal = DVM | pages = 6S–7S | publisher = Advanstar Communications | month = May | year = 2006 }}</ref>

===Signs and symptoms===
General signs and symptoms include depression, fever, weight loss, loss of appetite, loss of hair or fur and vomiting.  Lymphoma is the most common cancerous cause of [[Hypercalcaemia|hypercalcemia]] (high blood [[calcium]] levels) in dogs.<ref name=VetMed>{{cite journal | last = Lucas | first = Pamela | coauthors = Lacoste, Hugues; de Lorimier, Louis-Phillipe; Fan, Timothy M. | title = Treating paraneoplastic  hypercalcemia in dogs and cats | journal = Veterinary Medicine | volume = 102 | issue = 5 | pages = 314–331 | publisher = Advanstar Communications | month = May | year = 2007 }}</ref>  It can lead to the above signs and symptoms plus increased water drinking, increased urination, and [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s.  Hypercalcemia in these cases is caused by secretion of [[parathyroid hormone-related protein]].

Multicentric lymphoma presents as painless enlargement of the peripheral lymph nodes.  This is seen in areas such as under the jaw, the armpits, the groin, and behind the knees.  Enlargement of the liver and spleen causes the abdomen to distend.  Mediastinal lymphoma can cause fluid to collect around the lungs, leading to coughing and difficulty breathing. Hypercalcemia is most commonly associated with this type.<ref>{{cite web | title = Hypercalcemia of Malignancy | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/40404.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-28 }}</ref>

Gastrointestinal lymphoma causes vomiting, diarrhea, and [[melena]] (digested blood in the stool).  Low [[serum albumin]] levels and hypercalcemia can also occur.<ref name=canvet/>

Lymphoma of the skin is an uncommon occurrence.  The epitheliotropic form typically appears as itchy inflammation of the skin progressing to nodules and plaques.
The non-epitheliotropic form can have a wide variety of appearances, from a single lump to large areas of bruised, [[Skin ulcer|ulcerated]], hairless skin.<ref name=DVMMay/>  The epitheliotropic form must be differentiated from similar appearing conditions such as [[pemphigus|pemphigus vulgaris]], [[bullous pemphigoid]], and [[lupus erythematosus]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bhang D, Choi U, Kim M, Choi E, Kang M, Hwang C, Kim D, Youn H, Lee C |title=Epitheliotropic cutaneous lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) in a dog |journal=[[J Vet Sci]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=97–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16434861}}</ref>

Signs for lymphoma in other sites depend on the location.  Central nervous system involvement can cause [[seizure]]s or [[paralysis]].  Eye involvement, seen in 20 to 25 percent of cases,<ref name=Ogilvie>{{cite web | last = Ogilvie | first = Gregory K. | title = Canine Lymphoma: Protocols For 2004 | work = Proceedings of the 29th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2004 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2004&PID=8710&Category=1265&O=Generic | accessdate = 2006-08-20 }}</ref> can lead to [[glaucoma]], [[uveitis]], bleeding within the eye, [[retinal detachment]], and blindness.  Lymphoma in the bone marrow causes [[anemia]], low [[platelet]] count, and low [[white blood cell]] count.

===Diagnosis===
[[Image:Canine lymphoma 1.JPG|thumb|Cytology of lymphoma in a dog]]
[[Biopsy]] of affected lymph nodes or organs confirms the diagnosis, although a needle aspiration of an affected lymph node can increase suspicion of the disease.  [[X-ray]]s, [[ultrasound]], blood analysis, and bone marrow biopsy reveal other locations of the cancer.  The stage of the disease is important to treatment and [[prognosis]].
*Stage I - only one lymph node or [[lymphatic system|lymphoid tissue]] in one organ involved.
*Stage II - lymph nodes in only one area of the body involved.
*Stage III - generalized lymph node involvement.
*Stage IV - any of the above with liver or spleen involvement.
*Stage V - any of the above with blood or bone marrow involvement.<ref name=Morrison_1998/>
Each stage is divided into those with systemic symptoms (loss of appetite, weight loss, etc.) and those without.

===Treatment===
Complete cure is rare with lymphoma and treatment tends to be [[palliative care|palliative]], but long [[remission (medicine)|remission]] times are possible with [[chemotherapy]].  With effective protocols, average first remission times are 6 to 8 months.  Second remissions are shorter and harder to accomplish.  Average survival is 9 to 12 months.  The most common treatment is a combination of [[cyclophosphamide]], [[vincristine]], [[prednisone]], [[asparaginase|L-asparaginase]], and [[doxorubicin]].<ref name=Morrison_1998/>  Other chemotherapy drugs such as [[chlorambucil]], [[lomustine]] (CCNU), [[cytarabine|cytosine arabinoside]], and [[mitoxantrone]] are sometimes used in the treatment of lymphoma by themselves or in substitution for other drugs.  In most cases, appropriate treatment protocols cause few side effects, but white blood cell counts must be monitored.

Allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplantations (as is commonly done in humans) have recently been shown to be a possible treatment option for dogs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lupu M, Sullivan E, Westfall T, Little M, Weigler B, Moore P, Stroup P, Zellmer E, Kuhr C, Storb R |title=Use of multigeneration-family molecular dog leukocyte antigen typing to select a hematopoietic cell transplant donor for a dog with T-cell lymphoma |journal=J Am Vet Med Assoc |volume=228 |issue=5 |pages=728–32 |year=2006 |pmid=16506937 |doi=10.2460/javma.228.5.728}}</ref>  Most of the basic research on transplantation biology was generated in dogs. Current cure rates using stem cell therapy in dogs approximates that achieved in humans, 40-50%.

When cost is a factor, prednisone used alone can improve the symptoms dramatically, but it does not significantly affect the survival rate.  The average survival times of dogs treated with prednisone and untreated dogs are both one to two months.<ref name=Morrison_1998/>  Using prednisone alone can cause the cancer to become resistant to other chemotherapy agents, so it should only be used if more aggressive treatment is not an option.

[[Isotretinoin]] can be used to treat cutaneous lymphoma.<ref name=DVMMay/>

===Prognosis===
Untreated dogs have an average survival time of 60 days.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Siedlecki C, Kass P, Jakubiak M, Dank G, Lyons J, Kent M |title=Evaluation of an actinomycin-D-containing combination chemotherapy protocol with extended maintenance therapy for canine lymphoma |journal=Can Vet J |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=52–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16536229 |pmc=1316122}}</ref>  Lymphoma with a [[histology|histologic]] high grade generally respond better to treatment but have shorter survival times than dogs with low grade lymphoma.<ref name=canvet/>  Dogs with B-lymphocyte tumors have a longer survival time than T-lymphocyte tumors.<ref name=Morrison_1998/>  Mediastinal lymphoma has a poorer prognosis than other types, especially those with hypercalcemia.<ref name=Ogilvie/>  Clinical stage and substage have some prognostic value, with poorer prognosis associated with Stage V disease, and with substage b (clinical illness at time of presentation). <Withrow, 2001>

==Lymphoma in cats==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Lymphoma is the most common malignancy diagnosed in cats.<ref name=merckcat>{{cite web | title = Feline Leukemia Virus and Related Diseases: Introduction | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/57000.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-28 }}</ref>  Lymphoma in young cats occurs most frequently following infection with [[feline leukemia virus]] (FeLV) or to a lesser degree [[feline immunodeficiency virus]] (FIV).  These cats tend to have involvement of lymph nodes, spine, or mediastinum.  Cats with FeLV are 62 times more likely to develop lymphoma, and cats with both FeLV and FIV are 77 times more likely.<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author=Ettinger, Stephen J.;Feldman, Edward C.|title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|year=1995|isbn=0-7216-6795-3}}</ref>  Younger cats tend to have T-cell lymphoma and older cats tend to have B-cell lymphoma.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Seo K, Choi U, Bae B, Park M, Hwang C, Kim D, Youn H |title=Mediastinal lymphoma in a young Turkish Angora cat |journal=J Vet Sci |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=199–201 |year=2006 |pmid=16645348}}</ref>   Older cats tend to have gastrointestinal lymphoma without FeLV infection,<ref>{{cite web | title = Gastrointestinal Neoplasia | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/23307.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-28 }}</ref> although tests more sensitive to low level FeLV infections and replication-defective FeLV have found that many of these cats have been previously exposed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Richter, Keith P.|year=2006|title=Feline gastrointestinal lymphoma|work=Proceedings of the North American Veterinary Conference|url=http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/navc/2006/SAE/285.pdf?LA=1|accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref>  The same forms of lymphoma that are found in dogs also occur in cats, but gastrointestinal is the most common type.  Lymphoma of the kidney is the most common kidney tumor in cats, and lymphoma is also the most common heart tumor.<ref name=Morrison_1998/>

===Classification===
Gastrointestinal lymphoma is classified into low grade, intermediate grade, and high grade.  Low grade types include lymphocytic and [[small cell lymphoma]].  High grade types include [[lymphoblast]]ic, immunoblastic, and [[large cell]] lymphoma.  Low grade lymphoma is only found in the small intestine, while large grade can commonly be found in the stomach.<ref name=Matz>{{cite journal | last = Matz | first = Michael E. | title = Chronic Vomiting in a Cat | journal = Clinician's Brief | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–31 | publisher = North American Veterinary Conference | month = January | year = 2007 }}</ref>

===Symptoms===
Cats that develop lymphoma are much more likely to develop more severe symptoms than dogs. Whereas dogs often appear healthy initially except for swollen lymph nodes, cats will often be physically ill. The symptoms correspond closely to the location of the lymphoma.  The most common sites for alimentary (gastrointestinal) lymphoma are, in decreasing frequency, the [[small intestine]], the [[stomach]], the junction of the [[ileum]], [[cecum]], and [[colon (anatomy)|colon]].  Cats with the alimentary form of lymphoma often present with weight loss, rough hair coat, loss of appetite, vomiting and diarrhea, although vomiting and diarrhea are commonly absent as symptoms.<ref>{{cite web | last = Gaschen | first = Frédéric | title = Small Intestinal Diarrhea: Causes and Treatment | work = Proceedings of the 31st World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2006 | url = http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/wsava/2006/lecture12/GaschenF2.pdf?LA=1 | accessdate = 2007-01-28 }}</ref>  The tumor can also cause life-threatening blockage of the intestine.  Cats with the mediastinal form often have respiratory distress and fluid in the thoracic cavity. If lymphoma develops in the kidney, the cat may have increased water consumption and increased urination. Lymphoma of the kidney presents as bilateral kidney enlargement and failure. If the lymphoma is located in the nose, the cat may have discharge from the nose and facial swelling. Lymphoma of the heart causes [[heart failure|congestive heart failure]], [[pericardial effusion]], and [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s.  Ocular lymphoma in cats often presents as anterior [[uveitis]] (inflammation of the inside of the eye).<ref>{{cite journal | last = van der Woerdt | first = Alexandra | title = Iris Nodule in a Cat | journal = Clinician's Brief | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 7–8 | publisher = North American Veterinary Conference | month = June | year = 2007 }}</ref>  Cats who are also infected with FeLV often present with pale mucous membranes due to anemia. Anemia is a common problem in all cats with lymphoma, but hypercalcemia is rare.

Diagnosis is similar to dogs, except cats should be tested for FeLV and FIV.  It is important to differentiate the alimentary form of lymphoma from [[inflammatory bowel disease]] because the signs are so similar in cats.  A biopsy is necessary to do this.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Evans S, Bonczynski J, Broussard J, Han E, Baer K |title=Comparison of endoscopic and full-thickness biopsy specimens for diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease and alimentary tract lymphoma in cats |journal=J Am Vet Med Assoc |volume=229 |issue=9 |pages=1447–50 |year=2006 |pmid=17078807 |doi=10.2460/javma.229.9.1447}}</ref> One approach to differentiate inflammatory bowel disease from is to test the infiltrating lymphocytes for their monoclonal origin in lymphomas.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weiss AT, Klopfleisch R, Gruber AD|title=T-Cell Receptor γ Chain Variable and Joining Region Genes of Subgroup 1 are Clonally Rearranged in Feline B- and T-Cell Lymphoma.|journal=J Comp Pathol. |volume=Epub Sept. 14 2010 |issue= 2-3|pages= 123–34|year=2010 |pmid=20846665 |doi=10.1016/j.jcpa.2010.08.001}}</ref>

===Treatment and prognosis===
[[Chemotherapy]] is the mainstay of treatment for lymphoma in cats.  Most of the drugs used in dogs are used in cats, but the most common protocol uses cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone.<ref name=merckcat/>  Gastrointestinal lymphoma has also commonly been treated with a combination of prednisolone and high dose pulse [[chlorambucil]] with success.<ref name=Matz/>  The white blood cell count must be monitored.  Remission and survival times are comparable to dogs.  Lower stage lymphoma has a better prognosis. Multicentric lymphoma has a better response to treatment than the gastrointestinal form, but infection with FeLV worsens the prognosis.<ref name=Morrison_1998/>
About 75% of cats treated with chemotherapy for lymphoma do go into remission, unfortunately, most cats who have an initial remission relapse, and the median survival for a cat with lymphoma who is treated with chemotherapy is just 6 months. However, about one-third of cats treated with chemotherapy will survive more than 2 years after diagnosis, and a small number of these cats may be cured of their disease. Untreated, most cats with lymphoma die within 4–6 weeks. Most cats tolerate their chemotherapy well, and fewer than 5% have severe side effects. Cats do not lose their fur from chemotherapy, though loss of whiskers is possible. Other side effects include low white blood cell count, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, or fatigue, but these can typically be controlled well, and most cats have a good quality of life during treatment. If a cat relapses after attaining remission, the cat can be treated with different chemotherapy drugs to try to obtain a second remission, but the chances of obtaining a second remission are much lower than the chances of obtaining a first remission, and the second remission is often shorter than the first.

==Lymphoma in ferrets==<!-- This section is linked from [[Ferret]] -->
Lymphoma is common in [[ferret]]s and is the most common cancer in young ferrets.  There is some evidence that a [[retrovirus]] may play a role in the development of lymphoma like in cats.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hernández-Divers | first = Sonia M. | title = Ferret Diseases | work = Proceedings of the 30th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2005 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2005&PID=10894&O=Generic | accessdate = 2007-01-28 }}</ref>  The most commonly affected tissues are the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, intestine, mediastinum, bone marrow, lung, and kidney.

In young ferrets, the disease progresses rapidly.  The most common symptom is difficulty breathing caused by enlargement of the [[thymus]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Mayer, Joerg|year=2006|title=Update on ferret lymphoma|work=Proceedings of the North American Veterinary Conference|url=http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/navc/2006/SAE/631.pdf?LA=1|accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref>  Other symptoms include loss of appetite, weight loss, weakness, depression, and coughing.  It can also masquerade as a chronic disease such as an upper respiratory infection or gastrointestinal disease.  In older ferrets, lymphoma is usually chronic and can exhibit no symptoms for years.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ferret Neoplasia | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/170304.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-01 }}</ref>  Symptoms seen are the same as in young ferrets, plus [[splenomegaly]], abdominal masses, and peripheral lymph node enlargement.

Diagnosis is through biopsy and x-rays.  There may also be an increased [[lymphocyte]] count.  Treatment includes surgery for solitary tumors, [[splenectomy]] (when the spleen is very large), and chemotherapy.  The most common protocol uses prednisone, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide.<ref name=Hillyer_1997>{{cite book|author=Hillyer, Elizabeth V.;Quesenberry, Katherin E.|title=Ferrets, Rabbits, and Rodents: Clinical Medicine and Surgery|edition=1st|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|year=1997|isbn=0-7216-4023-0}}</ref>  Doxorubicin is used in some cases.  Chemotherapy in relatively healthy ferrets is tolerated very well, but possible side effects include loss of appetite, depression, weakness, vomiting, and loss of whiskers.  The white blood cell count must be monitored.  Prednisone used alone can work very well for weeks to months, but it may cause resistance to other chemotherapy agents.  Alternative treatments include [[vitamin C]] and [[Tabebuia serratifolia|Pau d'Arco]] (a bark extract).<ref name=Hillyer_1997/>

The prognosis for lymphoma in ferrets depends on the their health and the location of the cancer.  Lymphoma in the mediastinum, spleen, skin, and peripheral lymph nodes has the best prognosis, while lymphoma in the intestine, liver, abdominal lymph nodes, and bone marrow has the worst.<ref name=Hillyer_1997/>
