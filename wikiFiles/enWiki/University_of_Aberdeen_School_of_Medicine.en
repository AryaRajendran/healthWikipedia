'''Aberdeen University Medical School''' is a school of the [[University of Aberdeen, College of Life Sciences and Medicine|College of Life Sciences and Medicine]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]] in Scotland.

Medicine has been taught at the [[university]] since the  founding of [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]] in 1495. Indeed, the university has been described as the first medical school in Scotland and even the [[English speaking world]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Jennifer|last=Carter|title=Crown and Gown: Illustrated History of the University of Aberdeen, 1495-1995|year=1994|location=Aberdeen|publisher=Aberdeen University Press}}</ref>  Nevertheless, this assertion has been called into question as medical teaching already existed at St. Andrews, Oxford and London and even as late as 1787 there were calls "for the establishment of a medical school" in Aberdeen.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=FndbAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA117&dq=%22medical+school%22&hl=en&ei=dEEDTb3YJYr3sgaxy_zgCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFMQ6AEwCTgo#v=onepage&q=%22medical%20school%22&f=false A complete collection of the papers ... - Google Books<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> As of 2008 the Medical School takes 162 British students per year and an additional 13 from overseas.<ref name="statistics">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukmedicalschools.com/index.php?pageid=stats|title=www.ukmedicalschools.com UK Medical School Statistics|publisher=ukmedicalschools.com|accessdate=2008-09-08}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

There are two active [[Regius Professor]]ships, the [[Regius Professor of Medicine (Aberdeen)|Regius Chair of Medicine]] and [[Regius Professor of Surgery (Aberdeen)|Regius Chair of Surgery]]. The Regius Chairs of [[Midwifery]] and [[Regius Professor of Anatomy (Aberdeen)|Anatomy]] are in [[abeyance]].

==Division of Medical and Dental Education==
The University of Aberdeen offers undergraduate courses in medicine ([[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MB ChB]]), dentistry ([[Bachelor of Dental Surgery|BDS]]) and a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] programme in Health Science.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/medicine-dentistry/about/| title=About the School| publisher=School of Medicine and Dentistry, [[University of Aberdeen]]| accessdate=9 October 2009}}</ref> 

Postgraduate degrees are offered as taught courses, generally leading to the degree of [[Master of Science]] (MSc), and as research degrees either at a [[master's]] (MSc, [[MRes]], [[ChM]]) level or at [[doctoral]] ([[PhD]], [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]]) level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/prospectus/ugrad/study/subject.php?code=biomedical_science&prog=science|title=Biomedical Science|publisher=[[University of Aberdeen]]| accessdate=19 February 2007}}</ref>

===MB ChB course structure===
''The course structure at Aberdeen was recently updated and some of the details here may be inaccurate, especially for the earlier years of the course.''

In common with other [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[medical schools]], Aberdeen offers a five-year programme, leading to the award of the degrees of ''Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery'', MB ChB. Most teaching is traditional and [[didactic]] and [[problem-based learning]] is used rarely, unlike in [[Glasgow Medical School|Glasgow]]. The course is divided into four ''Phases'', detailed below. There is also the opportunity to undertake a further year of study to gain a BSc (Hons) in [[Biomedical Science|Medical Science]].<ref name="medprog" />

====Phase I====
'''Year 1: Fundamentals of Medical Sciences'''
 
After a short Basic Science in Medicine course including lectures in [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]], lecture courses and anatomy sessions on each different system address all normal aspects. These are complemented by practical sessions. The Community Course takes place one morning a week. Small groups of students are taught at local [[general practice]]s and encounter the many services for ensuring health in the community. For example, pairs of students visit a family with a newborn at home. The Communications Course involves small group tutorials and role play in the Clinical Skills Centre. A 4 week Student Selected Component allows small groups to choose from a wide range of healthcare topics, carry out in-depth research and report and present their findings.

In Phase I students begin to acquire understanding of the medical sciences which underpin medicine, the skills for effective self learning, and professional communication and attitudes appropriate to the profession.<ref name="medprog" />

====Phase II====
'''Year 2 & two thirds of Year 3: Principles of Clinical Medicine'''

After an introductory Principles of Disease course, lecture courses on each different system (gastrointestinal, respiratory etc.) address all abnormal aspects, ''viz'', diseases. The Community Course continues one morning a week but now the emphasis is on disease, disability and rehabilitation in the community. Two Medical Interviewing and Communications Courses involve small group tutorials, role play with ‘simulated patients’ including personal video sessions, in the Clinical Skills Centre. Clinical skills teaching and practice occur 2 mornings a week in the Clinical Skills Centre and the wards where students become adept at communication and clinical examination of patients. In two 4 week Student Selected Components, small groups choose from a wide range of topics on the molecular basis of medicine and then, population based disease. The groups carry out in-depth research, report and present their findings.

In Phase II, students are introduced to the concept of diseases and their general effects on patients, along with basic aspects of their investigation and management.<ref name="medprog" />

====Phase III====
'''Year 3 (remaining third) & Year 4: Specialist Clinical Practice'''

The phase begins with a Student Selected Component exploring ethical issues. The subsequent period consists of nine five-week clinical blocks organised partly by body system, e.g. [[alimentary]] or [[urinary]], and partly by the ‘multi-disciplines’, [[Paediatrics|Child Health]] and General Practice. During this phase students observe the theory from Phase II being put in to clinical practise in clinics and on wards and you will come into close contact with patients and relatives.

In Phase III, students develop their diagnosis and management skills for both individual patients and patient populations of all ages, with medical conditions affecting any of the body systems.<ref name="medprog" />

====Phase IV====
'''Year 5: Professional Practice'''

Phase IV is very much an apprentice year where students prepare for the competent, safe, effective and professional practice of medicine as a [[Foundation House Officer]]. The phase comprises four courses. In these, students have the opportunity to explore clinical areas that are of particular personal interest, whilst practising under supervision, a range of core skills common to all areas of medical training. The remaining course is a project based [[medical elective|elective]] on a medical topic, often undertaken overseas.

====Intercalated degree====
The Division of Medical and Dental Education also offers an [[Intercalation (university administration)|intercalated]] [[Bachelor of Science|BScMedSci (Hons)]] in Medical Science,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/medicine-dentistry/medical-dental/programmes/| title=Undergraduate Teaching Programmes| publisher=[[University of Aberdeen]]| accessdate=9 October 2009}}</ref> usually at the end of Phase II. The programme, which comprises both taught and research elements, is one year long and allows study in depth of an area of biomedical or clinical science. Appropriate training is provided. Each student works on an individual research project of their choice. By the end of the programme students are able to undertake and critically evaluate research and understand the basic principles of research methodology.<ref name="medprog" />

====Medical Society (Medsoc)====
Aberdeen [[Medsoc]] was a society set-up originally to bring medical students together in a social capacity.  It is the oldest Aberdeen University Student Society and today has over 600 members.  Annual social activities include Beerienteering, Medsoc Ball, Doctors v Medics Sports Day, Medsoc Revue and most recently a Fashion Show with proceeds going to a local children's charity.
