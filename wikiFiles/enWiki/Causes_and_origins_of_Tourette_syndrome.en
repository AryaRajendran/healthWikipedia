'''Causes and origins of Tourette syndrome''' have not been fully elucidated.  [[Tourette syndrome]] (also called "Tourette's syndrome", "Tourette's disorder", "Gilles de la Tourette syndrome", "GTS" or "TS") is an [[heredity|inherited]] [[neurological]] disorder with onset in childhood, characterized by the presence of multiple motor [[tic]]s and at least one phonic tic, which characteristically wax and wane.  Tourette's syndrome occurs along a spectrum of [[tic disorder]]s, which includes transient tics and chronic tics.<ref name=emed>Black, KJ.

The exact cause of Tourette's is unknown, but it is well established that both genetic and environmental factors are involved.<ref name=AN2intro>Walkup JT, Mink JW, Hollenback PJ, (eds).

Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA, 2006, p. xv.</ref>  involving abnormal activity of the brain chemical, or [[neurotransmitter]], [[dopamine]].  Non-genetic factors—while not causing Tourette's—can influence the severity of the disorder.  Some forms of Tourette's may be genetically linked to [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD), while the relationship between Tourette's and [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) is not yet fully understood.

== Genetic factors==
Genetic studies, including [[twin studies]],<ref>Pauls DL. The genetics of Tourette syndrome. ''Curr Psychiatry Rep.'' 2001 Apr;3(2):152-7. PMID 11276411</ref> have proven that the overwhelming majority of cases of Tourette syndrome are inherited, although the exact mode of inheritance is not yet known.<ref>Robertson MM. Tourette syndrome, associated conditions and the complexities of treatment.  ''Brain''. 2000;123 Pt 3:425–462. p. 425. {{DOI|10.1093/brain/123.3.425}} PMID 10686169</ref>  Tic disorders have long been thought to be inherited as an [[autosomal]] [[dominant gene]], but recent research challenges the autosomal dominant hypothesis, and suggests an additive model involving multiple genes.<ref name=Zinner>Zinner SH. Tourette disorder. ''Pediatr Rev''. 2000;21(11):372. PMID 11077021</ref><ref name=Bagheri>Bagheri MM, Kerbeshian J, Burd L. Recognition and management of Tourette's syndrome and tic disorders.

Tics are very familial, but not in a Mendelian pattern (dominant, recessive, etc.). You can't 'inherit' the committee decision to define a problem in a specific way, so TS itself can't be inherited. It's a tic disorder that is inherited."<ref name=FreemanBlog>Freeman, RD.  [http://www.tourette-confusion.blogspot.com/ Tourette's Syndrome: minimizing confusion]. Retrieved on February 8, 2006.</ref>

In some cases, tics may not be inherited; these cases are identified as "sporadic" Tourette syndrome (also known as [[tourettism]]) because a genetic link is missing.<ref name=Mejia>Mejia NI, Jankovic J. Secondary tics and tourettism.  ''Rev Bras Psiquiatr''. 2005;27(1):11-7. PMID 15867978 [http://web.archive.org/web/20070628191850/http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rbp/v27n1/23707.pdf Full-text PDF]</ref>

A person with Tourette syndrome has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) to one of his/her children.  [[Gender]] appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability, with males more likely to express tics than females.<ref name=Zinner/>  Tourette syndrome is a condition of [[incomplete penetrance]], meaning not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms. Tourette's also shows [[Expressivity|variable expression]]—even family members with the same [[Genetics|genetic]] makeup may show different levels of symptom severity. The gene(s) may express as Tourette syndrome, as a milder tic disorder (transient or chronic tics), or as obsessive compulsive symptoms with no tics at all.<ref>van de Wetering BJ, Heutink P. The genetics of the Gilles de la Tourette syndrome: a review.  ''J Lab Clin Med.'' 1993 May;121(5):638–45. PMID 8478592</ref>  Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) will have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention.<ref name=TSAFAQ> Tourette Syndrome Association.

Recent research suggests that a small number of Tourette syndrome cases may be caused by a defect on [[chromosome 13 (human)|chromosome 13]] of gene [[SLITRK1]].  Some cases of [[tourettism]] (tics due to reasons other than inherited Tourette's syndrome) can be caused by [[mutation]].<ref name=Mejia>Mejia NI, Jankovic J. Secondary tics and tourettism.

PMID 15867978 [http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rbp/v27n1/23707.pdf Full-text PDF]</ref> The finding of a chromosomal abnormality appears to apply to a very small minority of cases (1–2%).  Studies to locate all of the genes implicated in Tourette's syndrome are ongoing.<ref>Schmidt, William (October 19, 2005).

The exact mechanism affecting the inherited vulnerability has not been established, and the precise [[etiology]] of Tourette syndrome is not known. Tics are believed to result from dysfunction in the [[central nervous system]],<ref name=Bagheri/>  in the cortical and subcortical regions, the [[thalamus]], [[basal ganglia]], and [[frontal lobe|frontal cortex]] of the brain.<ref name=AN2intro>Walkup JT, Mink JW, Hollenback PJ, (eds).

==Non-genetic influences==
Studies suggest that non-genetic, [[Natural environment|environmental]], [[infection|infectious]], or [[psychosocial]] factors—while not causing Tourette's—can influence the severity of the disorder.<ref name=Zinner/> [[Twin studies]] have shown that the twin with lower birth weight is more likely to have more noticeable symptoms.<ref>Hyde TM, Aaronson BA, Randolph C, ''et al.''

PMID 8083136</ref>  while not causing tics, may be risk factors for increased severity of tics.  [[Autoimmune]] processes may affect tic severity in some cases:  the unproven and contentious hypothesis that Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections, [[PANDAS]], plays a role in the onset of tic disorders and OCD is a current focus of research.<ref name=Swerdlow>Swerdlow, NR.

==Relation with OCD and ADHD==
Some forms of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD) may be [[gene|genetically]] linked to Tourette's, or an alternate expression of the condition;<ref>Pauls DL, Towbin KE, Leckman JF, ''et al.'' Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Evidence supporting a genetic relationship. ''Arch Gen Psychiatry''. 1986 Dec;43(12):1180–2. PMID 3465280</ref> genetic studies show an increased rate of tics and obsessive-compulsive behaviors or OCD in relatives of patients with Tourette's, and "reinforce the idea that at least some forms of OCD are [[etiologic|etiologically]] related to TS, and may, therefore, be a variant expression of the same etiologic factors that are important for the expression of tics."<ref name=Cohenetal> [[Donald J. Cohen|Cohen DJ]], Jankovic J, Goetz CG, (eds). [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0781724058 ''Advances in Neurology, Vol. 85, Tourette Syndrome''.] Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA, 2001.</ref> Further evidence supporting that OCD and Tourette's are alternative expressions of a common genetic vulnerability is that males inheriting the genetic vulnerability are more likely to display tics, while females are more likely to display obsessive-compulsive traits.<ref name=Bagheri/> 

The genetic relationship of [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) to Tourette's syndrome is less clear, with some evidence to suggest no genetic linkage, and some evidence to suggest that some forms of Tourette's syndrome may be genetically related to ADHD.<ref name=LCBook>[[James F. Leckman|Leckman JF]], [[Donald J. Cohen|Cohen DJ.]] [http://web.archive.org/web/20050303223505/http://info.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/tsocd/tsbook.htm ''Tourette's Syndrome—Tics, Obsessions, Compulsions: Developmental Psychopathology and Clinical Care.''] John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1999.</ref>   Not all persons with Tourette's syndrome will have ADHD or OCD, although in specialty clinics where the most impaired patients are treated, a high percentage of patients seeking treatment do have ADHD.<ref name=Bagheri/> The high co-occurrence of ADHD observed in specialty clinics may be due to clinical [[ascertainment bias]].  Further study is needed to understand the genetic relationship between ADHD and Tourette's.<ref name=LCBook/>
