'''Osteoarthritis''' (OA) also known as '''degenerative [[arthritis]]''' or '''degenerative joint disease''' or '''osteoarthrosis''', is a group of mechanical abnormalities involving degradation of [[joint]]s,<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000076356|osteoarthritis}}</ref> including [[articular cartilage]] and [[subchondral bone]].  Symptoms may include joint pain, tenderness, stiffness, [[Joint locking (symptom)|locking]], and sometimes an [[joint effusion|effusion]]. A variety of causes—hereditary, developmental, metabolic, and mechanical deficits—may initiate processes leading to loss of [[cartilage]].  When bone surfaces become less well protected by cartilage, bone may be exposed and damaged.  As a result of decreased movement secondary to pain, regional muscles may [[atrophy]], and [[ligament]]s may become more lax.<ref name=NICE>{{cite web | last = Conaghan | first = Phillip | title = Osteoarthritis — National clinical guideline for care and management in adults | url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG059FullGuideline.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-04-29 }}</ref>

Treatment generally involves a combination of exercise, lifestyle modification, and [[analgesics]]. If pain becomes debilitating, [[joint replacement]] surgery may be used to improve the quality of life. OA is the most common form of arthritis,<ref name=NICE/> and the leading cause of chronic disability in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Prevalence of disabilities and associated health conditions among adults—United States, 1999 |journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. |volume=50 |issue=7 |pages=120–5 |year=2001 |month=February |pmid=11393491 |author1= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref> It affects about 8 million people in the United Kingdom and nearly 27 million people in the United States.<ref name="Management">{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23139341|last1=Van Manen|first1=MD|last2=Nace|first2=J|last3=Mont|first3=MA|title=Management of primary knee osteoarthritis and indications for total knee arthroplasty for general practitioners.|journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association|volume=112 |issue=11 |pages=709–715 |year=2012 |month=November |pmid=23139341}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Heberden-Arthrose.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bouchard's nodes]] and [[Heberden's node]]s may form in osteoarthritis]]

The main symptom is [[pain]], causing [[disability|loss of ability]] and often stiffness. "Pain" is generally described as a sharp ache, or a burning sensation in the associate [[muscle]]s and [[tendon]]s. OA can cause a crackling noise (called "[[crepitus]]") when the affected joint is moved or touched, and patients may experience muscle [[spasm]] and contractions in the tendons.  Occasionally, the joints may also be filled with fluid. Humid and cold weather increases the pain in many patients.<ref>{{cite journal | author = McAlindon T., Formica M., Schmid C.H., Fletcher J. | year = 2007 | title = Changes in barometric pressure and ambient temperature influence osteoarthritis pain | url = http://eclips.consult.com/eclips/article/Medicine/S0084-3873(08)79099-0 | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 120 | issue = 5| pages = 429–434 |pmid=17466654 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjmed.2006.07.036 }}</ref><ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000423|Osteoarthritis}}</ref>

OA commonly affects the [[hands]], feet, [[vertebral column|spine]], and the large [[weight bearing]] joints, such as the [[hip joint|hips]] and [[knee]]s, although in theory, any joint in the body can be affected.  As OA progresses, the affected joints appear larger, are stiff and painful, and usually feel better with gentle use but worse with excessive or prolonged use, thus distinguishing it from [[rheumatoid arthritis]].

In smaller joints, such as at the fingers, hard bony enlargements, called  [[Heberden's node]]s (on the [[distal interphalangeal joints]]) and/or [[Bouchard's nodes]] (on the proximal interphalangeal joints), may form, and though they are not necessarily painful, they do limit the movement of the fingers significantly. OA at the toes leads to the formation of [[bunion]]s, rendering them red or swollen. Some people notice these physical changes before they experience any pain. 

OA is the most common cause of joint effusion, sometimes called ''[[water on the knee]]'' in lay terms, an accumulation of excess fluid in or around the knee joint.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/water-on-the-knee/DS00662 Water on the knee], MayoClinic.com</ref>

==Causes==
Some believe that mechanical stress on joints underlies all OA, with many and varied sources of mechanical stress, including misalignments of bones caused by congenital or pathogenic causes; mechanical injury; overweight; loss of strength in muscles supporting joints; and impairment of peripheral nerves, leading to sudden or uncoordinated movements that overstress joints.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brandt KD, Dieppe P, Radin E |title=Etiopathogenesis of osteoarthritis |journal=Med.

=== Primary ===
[[Image:Osteoarthritis left knee.jpg|thumb|Primary osteoarthritis of the left knee. Note the [[osteophytes]], narrowing of the joint space (arrow), and increased subchondral bone density (arrow).]]

A number of studies have shown that there is a greater prevalence of the disease among [[sibling]]s and especially [[Semiidentical twins|identical twins]], indicating a hereditary basis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Valdes AM, Spector TD |title=The contribution of genes to osteoarthritis |journal=Rheum Dis Clin North Am. |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=581–603 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18687274 |doi=10.1016/j.rdc.2008.04.008 |url=}}</ref>  Although a single factor is not generally sufficient to cause the disease, about half of the variation in susceptibility has been assigned to genetic factors.<ref>{{Cite journal|author= Spector TD, MacGregor AJ |year= 2004 |month= |title= Risk factors for osteoarthritis: genetics |journal=  OsteoArthritis and Cartilage |volume=12 |issue= |pages= S39–44 |pmid=14698640 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14698640|doi= 10.1016/j.joca.2003.09.005}}</ref>

The development of OA is correlated with a history of previous joint injury and with obesity, especially with respect to knees.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Coggon D, Reading I |title=Knee osteoarthritis and obesity |journal=International Journal of Obesity Related Metabolic Disorders |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=622–627 |year=2001 |month=May |pmid=11360143 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11360143 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0801585}}</ref>  Since the correlation with obesity has been observed not only for knees but also for non-weight bearing joints and the loss of body fat is more closely related to symptom relief than the loss of body weight, it has been suggested that there may be a metabolic link to body fat as opposed to just mechanical loading.<ref>{{cite journal |author=P Pottie, N Presle |title=Obesity and osteoarthritis: more complex than predicted! |journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases |volume=65 |issue=11 |pages=1403–1405 |year=2006 |month= |doi=10.1136/ard.2006.061994 |url=http://ard.bmj.com/content/65/11/1403.full |pmid=17038451 |pmc=1798356}}</ref>

Changes in sex hormone levels may play a role in the development of OA as it is more prevalent among post-menopausal women than among men of the same age.<ref>{{Cite journal|last= Linn |first= Sarah |year= 2012 |month= May |title= Role of Sex Hormones in the Development of Osteoarthritis |journal=  Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation |volume= 4 |issue=5 |pages= 169–173 |doi= 10.1016/j.pmrj.2012.01.013|last2= Murtaugh|first2= Bryan|last3= Casey|first3= Ellen}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last= Tanamas |first= SK |year= 2011 |month= June |title= Sex hormones and structural changes in osteoarthritis: a systematic review |journal= Maturitas |volume= 69 |issue=2 |pages= 141–156 |doi= 10.1016/j.maturitas.2011.03.019|last2= Wijethilake|first2= Pushpika|last3= Wluka|first3= Anita E.|last4= Davies-Tuck|first4= Miranda L.|last5= Urquhart|first5= Donna M.|last6= Wang|first6= Yuanyuan|last7= Cicuttini|first7= Flavia M.|pmid= 21481553}}</ref>  A study of mice found natural female hormones to be protective while injections of the male hormone [[dihydrotestosterone]] reduced protection.<ref>{{Cite journal|last= Ma |first= H.L. |year= 2007 |month=June |title= Osteoarthritis severity is sex dependent in a surgical mouse model |journal=  OsteoArthritis and Cartilage |volume= 15 |issue=6 |pages= 695–700 |doi= 10.1016/j.joca.2006.11.005|last2= Blanchet|first2= T.J.|last3= Peluso|first3= D.|last4= Hopkins|first4= B.|last5= Morris|first5= E.A.|last6= Glasson|first6= S.S.|pmid= 17207643}}</ref>

=== Secondary ===
This type of OA is caused by other factors but the resulting pathology is the same as for primary OA:
* [[Alkaptonuria]]
* [[Congenital]] [[disease|disorder]]s of joints
* [[Diabetes]]
* [[Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome]]
* [[Hemochromatosis]] and [[Wilson's disease]]
* Inflammatory diseases (such as [[Perthes' disease]]), ([[Lyme disease]]),  and all chronic forms of arthritis (e.g. [[costochondritis]], [[gout]], and [[rheumatoid arthritis]]). In gout, [[uric acid]] crystals cause the cartilage to degenerate at a faster pace.
* [[Injury]] to joints or ligaments (such as the [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]]), as a result of an [[accident]] or orthopedic operations.
* [[Ligament]]ous deterioration or instability may be a factor.
* [[Marfan syndrome]]
* [[Obesity]]
* [[Septic arthritis]] (infection of a joint)

==Pathophysiology==

Primary OA is a chronic degenerative disorder related to but not caused by [[aging]], as there are people well into their nineties who have no clinical or functional signs of the disease. As a person ages, the water content of the cartilage decreases<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.umm.edu/patiented/articles/what_osteoarthritis_000035_1.htm | title = Osteoarthritis | publisher = [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] Medical Center | date = 2005-05-08 | accessdate = 2009-04-25 | last = Simon | first = H | coauthors = Zieve D }}</ref>{{Better source|This is an interesting observation, but really needs a medical/scientific peer review source, not a website|date=April 2013}} as a result of a reduced [[proteoglycan]] content, thus causing the cartilage to be less resilient. The water content of healthy cartilage is finely balanced by compressive force driving water out & swelling pressure drawing water in.<ref name="Maroudas A 1976">{{cite DOI|10.1038/260808a0}}</ref> Collagen fibres exert the compressive force, whereas the Gibbs-Donnan effect & cartilage proteoglycans create osmotic pressure which tends to draw water in.<ref name="Maroudas A 1976"/>
However during onset of OA there is an increase in cartilage water content.<ref name="Bollet AJ 1966">{{cite DOI|10.1172/JCI105423}}</ref><ref name="Brocklehurst R 1984">{{cite PMID|6690447}}</ref><ref name="Chou MC 2009">{{cite DOI|10.1016/j.joca.2008.09.009}}</ref><ref name="Grushko G 1989">{{cite PMID|2805680}}</ref><ref name="Mankin HJ 1975">{{cite PMID|1123375}}</ref> This increase occurs because whilst there is an overall loss of proteoglycans,<ref name="Brocklehurst R 1984"/><ref name="Venn M 1977">{{cite DOI|10.1136/ard.36.2.121}}</ref> it is outweighed by a loss of collagen.<ref name="Maroudas A 1976"/><ref name="Venn M 1977"/> Without the protective effects of the proteoglycans, the [[collagen]] fibers of the cartilage can become susceptible to degradation and thus exacerbate the degeneration. [[Inflammation]] of the surrounding [[joint capsule]] can also occur, though often mild (compared to what occurs in rheumatoid arthritis). This can happen as breakdown products from the cartilage are released into the synovial space, and the cells lining the joint attempt to remove them. New [[bone]] outgrowths, called "spurs" or [[osteophyte]]s, can form on the margins of the joints, possibly in an attempt to improve the congruence of the articular cartilage surfaces. These bone changes, together with the inflammation, can be both painful and debilitating.

==Diagnosis==
[[medical diagnosis|Diagnosis]] is made with reasonable certainty based on history and clinical examination.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhang W |title=EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis |journal=Ann.

In 1990, the [[American College of Rheumatology]], using data from a multi-center study, developed a set of criteria for the diagnosis of hand OA based on hard tissue enlargement and swelling of certain joints.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uptodate.com/patients/content/topic.do?topicKey=~77ll0j9jfS9fuD |title=Patient information: Osteoarthritis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics) |author=Kalunian, Kenneth C |year=2013 |work= |publisher=UpToDate |accessdate=15 February 2013}}</ref> These criteria were found to be 92% [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitive]] and 98% [[specificity (tests)|specific]] for hand OA versus other entities such as rheumatoid arthritis and [[spondyloarthropathy|spondyloarthropathies]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Altman R |title=The American College of Rheumatology criteria for the classification and reporting of osteoarthritis of the hand |journal=Arthritis Rheum. |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=1601–10 |year=1990 |pmid=2242058|doi=10.1002/art.1780331101 |author-separator=, |author2=Alarcón G |author3=Appelrouth D |display-authors=3 |last4=Bloch |first4=D. |last5=Borenstein |first5=D. |last6=Brandt |first6=K. |last7=Brown |first7=C. |last8=Cooke |first8=T. D. |last9=Daniel |first9=W.}}</ref>

Related pathologies whose names may be confused with OA include pseudo-arthrosis. This is derived from the Greek words pseudo, meaning "false", and arthrosis, meaning "joint." Radiographic diagnosis results in diagnosis of a fracture within a joint, which is not to be confused with OA which is a degenerative pathology affecting a high incidence of distal phalangeal joints of female patients. A polished ivory-like appearance may also develop on the bones of the affected joints, reflecting a change called [[eburnation]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Neil Vasan; Le, Tao; Bhushan, Vikas |title=First Aid for the USMLE Step 1, 2010 (First Aid USMLE) |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |year=2010 |page=378 |isbn=0-07-163340-5 |url=http://books.google.se/books?id=eVAtPktgw0UC&pg=PA169}}</ref>

=== Classification ===
OA can be classified into either primary or secondary depending on whether or not there is an identifiable underlying cause.

Both primary generalized nodal OA and erosive OA (EOA. also called inflammatory OA) are sub-sets of primary OA. EOA is a much less common, and more aggressive inflammatory form of OA which often affects the distal interphalangeal joints and has characteristic changes on x-ray.

==Management==
Lifestyle modification (such as weight loss and exercise) and [[analgesics]] are the mainstay of treatment. [[Acetaminophen]] / paracetamol is used first line and [[NSAIDs]] are only recommended as add on therapy if pain relief is not sufficient.<ref name=Cochrane10>{{cite journal |author=Flood J |title=The role of acetaminophen in the treatment of osteoarthritis |journal=Am J Manag Care |volume=16 |issue=Suppl Management |pages=S48–54 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20297877 }}</ref>  This is due to the relative greater safety of acetaminophen.<ref name=Cochrane10/>

===Lifestyle modification===
For overweight people, [[weight loss]] may be an important factor. Patient education has been shown to be helpful in the self-management of arthritis.  It decreases pain, improves function, reduces stiffness and fatigue, and reduces medical usage.<ref name="Hip Osteoarthritis 2009"/> A meta-analysis has shown patient education can provide on average 20% more pain relief when compared to NSAIDs alone in patients with hip OA.<ref name="Hip Osteoarthritis 2009"/>

===Physical measures===
For most people with OA, graded exercise should be the mainstay of their self-management. Moderate [[exercise]] leads to improved functioning and decreased pain in people with OA of the knee.<ref name=Bosomworth09/><ref name="Hip Osteoarthritis 2009">{{cite journal |author=Cibulka MT, White DM, Woehrle J, ''et al.'' |title=Hip pain and mobility deficits—hip osteoarthritis: clinical practice guidelines linked to the international classification of functioning, disability, and health from the orthopaedic section of the American Physical Therapy Association |journal=J Orthop Sports Phys Ther |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=A1–25 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19352008 |doi=10.2519/jospt.2009.0301 }}</ref> While there is some evidence for certain [[physical therapy|physical therapies]] evidence for the combined program is limited.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=SY|coauthors=Olson-Kellogg, B; Shamliyan, TA; Choi, JY; Ramakrishnan, R; Kane, RL|title=Physical therapy interventions for knee pain secondary to osteoarthritis: a systematic review|journal=Annals of internal medicine|date=2012 Nov 6|volume=157|issue=9|pages=632–44|pmid=23128863|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-157-9-201211060-00007}}</ref>

OA affects nearly 27 million people in the [[United States]], accounting for 25% of visits to [[primary care physician]]s, and half of all [[NSAID]] prescriptions.

Globally OA causes moderate to severe disability in 43.4&nbsp;million people as of 2004.<ref>{{vcite book|last=Organization|first=World Health|title=The global burden of disease : 2004 update.|year=2008|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva, Switzerland|isbn=9789241563710|pages=35|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}</ref>

==Etymology==
OA is derived from the Greek word part ''osteo-'', meaning "of the bone", combined with ''arthritis'': ''arthr-'',  meaning "joint", and ''-itis'', the meaning of which has come to be associated with [[inflammation]]. The ''-itis'' of OA could be considered misleading as inflammation is not a conspicuous feature. Some clinicians refer to this condition as ''osteoarthosis'' to signify the lack of inflammatory response.

==History==
Evidence for OA found in the fossil record is studied by [[paleopathologists]], specialists in ancient disease and injury. OA has been reported in fossils of the large carnivorous dinosaur ''[[Allosaurus]] fragilis''.<ref name="molnar-pathology">Molnar, R. E., 2001, Theropod paleopathology: a literature survey: In: Mesozoic  Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University  Press, p. 337-363.</ref>

==Research==
There are ongoing efforts to determine if there are agents that modify outcomes in OA. [[Sprifermin]] is one candidate drug.  There is also tentative evidence that [[strontium ranelate]] may decrease degeneration in OA and improve outcomes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Civjan|first=Natanya|title=Chemical Biology: Approaches to Drug Discovery and Development to Targeting Disease|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781118437674|page=313|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ezXLFlwfJycC&pg=PA313}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Bruyère|first=O|coauthors=Burlet, N; Delmas, PD; Rizzoli, R; Cooper, C; Reginster, JY|title=Evaluation of symptomatic slow-acting drugs in osteoarthritis using the GRADE system|journal=BMC musculoskeletal disorders|date=16 December 2008 |volume=9|page=165|pmid=19087296|doi=10.1186/1471-2474-9-165|pmc=2627841}}</ref>
