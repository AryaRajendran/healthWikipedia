The '''World Health Summit''' is a gathering of leaders from [[academia]], [[science]], [[politics]] and [[industry]] as well as stakeholders of the [[private sector]] and [[civil society]]. The summit was initiated on the occasion of the 300th year anniversary of the [[Charité]] – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, under the patronage of the German chancellor, [[Angela Merkel]], and the President of the French Republic, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]. It is now held annually in [[Berlin]]. The meeting is presided over by [[:de:Detlev Ganten|Prof. Detlev Ganten]], a medical research scientist and Chairman of the Board of the Charité foundation. It is organized by the [[The M8 Alliance|M8 Alliance of Academic Health Centers and Medical Universities]] together with the National Academies, the [[EU]] and [[WHO]].  President [[Francois Hollande]] continues the tradition of co-patronage by the French head of state.

== Mission ==
According to the World Health Summit's Mission Statement, published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 2009, the conference's mission is in keeping with the [[UN Declaration of Human Rights]]' (1948) acknowledgement of health as a fundamental human right. Since at present more than half of the world's population is not receiving proper medical care,<ref>http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/the-summit/summit-profile/</ref> the organizers of the World Health Summit see their mission in the improvement of [[healthcare]] worldwide and the achievement of equitable access to medication and prevention. This mission is seen as threatened by unsolved and newly emerging problems such as: "The demographic shift to an ageing society; [[climate change]] and its health consequences that are already being felt; new types of epidemics, such as [[obesity]], mental ill-health, and violence and injury, in developed and developing countries, in addition to the still raging epidemics of [[HIV]], [[tuberculosis|TB]], and [[malaria]]; the rising costs of health care; and the worldwide [[economic crisis]] and its serious threats to the health of populations across the globe."<ref>http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/the-summit/summit-profile/mission-statement/#c178</ref>

Thus, the conference initiators intend to address these challenges by bringing together stakeholders from [[research]], education, [[clinical care]] and many other disciplines to jointly develop strategies to tackle these issues. The outcome of this multi-sectoral summit is intended to serve decision-makers and governments as recommendations for future healthcare challenges.<ref>Shaping the future of health care: the Berlin 2009 Evolution of Medicine Summit.

== Summit Profile ==

Each year the World Health Summit is being held under a different motto and focuses on different key topics.  These are formulated by members of the [[The M8 Alliance|M8 Alliance of Academic Health Centers and Medical Universities]] and also by the eminent academicians, researchers and clinicians who form the World Health Summit Council.

=== Previous Meetings ===
The first World Health Summit under the motto "The Evolution of Medicine" took place 14–18 October 2009 at the Charité University, Berlin. 700 participants worked on concrete recommendations for dealing with pandemic planning, effective prevention strategies and climate change-related diseases. Prof. Dr. Axel Kahn from the [[Université Paris Descartes]], France, held the co-presidency of the first World Health Summit.<ref>Charité Berlin, Book of Proccedings 2009: http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/fileadmin/downloads/Dokumente_Download/WHS%202010%20Book%20of%20Proceedings.pdf</ref><ref>World Health Summit Program 2009: The Evolution of Medicine http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/fileadmin/downloads/whsSummitProgram.pdf</ref>

In 2010, the World Health Summit was held 10–13 October in Berlin. The conference focused on the key topics: Translation – Transition – Transformation. In keeping with these topics, solutions facilitating the translation of medical knowledge into interventions that benefit patients across the globe, the new health challenges in a world of constant transition and the transformation of health politics and management to respond to these challenges were discussed. The co-president of the meeting was Prof. Dr. Stephen K. Smith, Principal of the Faculty of Medicine, [[Imperial College London]].<ref>World Health Summit 2010, Final Program http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/fileadmin/downloads/Dokumente_Download/WHS%202010%20Final%20Program%20Print_online.pdf</ref>

The third World Health Summit took place 23–26 October 2011 under the motto "Today's Science – Tomorrows Agenda". Prof. Dr. Steve Wesselingh from [[Monash University]], Melbourne, Australia officially held the co-presidency for the year preceding the third Summit with Prof. Dr. Christina Mitchell deputising as Co-President at the Summit itself in Prof. Dr. Wesselingh's absence.

Professor Michael Klag, Dean of the [[Bloomberg School of Public Health]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] of the United States was Co-President of the fourth World Health Summit held in Berlin 20–24 October 2012.

Professor John Wong of the [[National University of Singapore]] is the Co-President for the fifth World Health Summit in 2013, and also for the satellite Asia-Pacific conference of the World Health Summit to be held in Singapore in April 2013.

The [[University of Sao Paulo]] will exercise the World Health Summit co-presidency in 2014.

Traditionally the co-presidency institution hosts the annual M8 Alliance planning meeting in its own home city in March preceding the Summit in October of that year.

=== Criticism ===

The World Health Summit has been criticized by Thomas Gebauer, director of [[medico international]], as an "elitist club of decision makers",<ref>http://www.aerzteblatt.de/nachrichten/38559/Alternativkonferenz_zum_World_Health_Summit_Wir_brauchen_keinen_neuen_Club.htm</ref> that ignores both the social factor of global health issues and the notion of health as a human right, but rather serves particular interests.
Thus, in 2009, the Frankfurt-based organization [[medico international]] intitiated an alternative conference as a form of protest against the World Health Summit.<ref>http://www.medico.de/en/search/?cx=007400307825010633883%3A10wmrhxa_wm&cof=FORID%3A11&ie=UTF-8&q=world+health+summit&sa=Search#947</ref>

Despite all the criticism of the summit, and in particular of its sponsors - the pharma industry - both sides, the critics and the initiators of the World Health Summit, showed a readiness to engage in a constructive discussion. [[:de:Detlev Ganten|Professor Dr med Detlev Ganten]], the permanent Co-President of the World Health Summit invited the participants of the 2009 alternative conference to attend the World Health Summit 2010 and, thus, to enter into a dialogue.<ref>http://www.aerzteblatt.de/nachrichten/38559/Alternativkonferenz_zum_World_Health_Summit_Wir_brauchen_keinen_neuen_Club.htm</ref>

== M8 Alliance ==

The [[The M8 Alliance|M8 Alliance of Academic Health Centers and Medical Universities]] is an academic network of institutions of education and research, including national academies where these exist. It was first officially inaugurated in 2009 on occasion of the first World Health Summit. This international network provides the academic foundation to the World Health Summit. According to the 'M8 Alliance Profile',<ref>http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/m8-alliance/profile/</ref> the network seeks to improve [[global health]] and works with political and economic decision makers and civil society to develop science-based solutions for health challenges worldwide. It was created as a permanent platform for framing future considerations of global medical developments and health challenges.<ref>http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/m8-alliance/profile/</ref>

The [[The M8 Alliance|M8 Alliance]] consists of thirteen member sfrom five continents:.<ref>[http://www.worldhealthsummit.org World Health Summit website]</ref> After the second World Health Summit in 2010, the [[University of Sao Paulo]] and the [[National University of Singapore]] joined the network, with the [[University of Montreal]] being welcomed into the group in 2012.
