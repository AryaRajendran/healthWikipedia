<!-- What/epidemiology/classification -->
A '''kidney stone''', also known as a '''renal calculus''' (from the [[Latin]] ''rēnēs'', "kidneys" and ''[[Calculus (medicine)|calculus]]'', "pebble") is a solid [[enterolith|concretion]] or [[crystal]] aggregation formed in the kidneys from [[dietary mineral]]s in the [[urine]].

[[Urolithiasis|Urinary stones]] are typically classified by their location in the [[kidney]] (nephrolithiasis), [[ureter]] (ureterolithiasis), or [[urinary bladder|bladder]] ([[Bladder stone|cystolithiasis]]), or by their [[chemical composition]] ([[calcium]]-containing, [[struvite]], [[uric acid]], or other compounds). About 80% of those with kidney stones are men. Men most commonly experience their first episode between 20-30 years of age, while for women the age at first presentation is somewhat later.

<!-- symptoms/signs/diagnosis -->
Kidney stones typically leave the body by passage in the urine stream, and many stones are formed and passed without causing symptoms. If stones grow to sufficient size (usually at least {{convert|3|mm|in|sp=us}}) they can cause obstruction of the ureter. Ureteral obstruction causes [[postrenal azotemia]] and [[hydronephrosis]] (distension and dilation of the [[renal pelvis]] and [[major calyx|calyces]]), as well as [[spasm]] of the ureter. This leads to [[pain]], most commonly felt in the [[Torso|flank]] (the area between the ribs and hip), lower abdomen, and [[groin]] (a condition called [[renal colic]]). Renal colic can be associated with [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[fever]], [[hematuria|blood in the urine]], [[Pyuria|pus]] in the urine, and [[Dysuria|painful urination]]. Renal colic typically comes in waves lasting 20 to 60 minutes, beginning in the flank or lower back and often radiating to the groin or genitals. The [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of kidney stones is made on the basis of information obtained from the [[Medical history|history]], [[physical examination]], [[urinalysis]], and [[Projectional radiography|radiographic]] studies. [[Medical ultrasonography|Ultrasound examination]] and [[blood test]]s may also aid in the diagnosis.

<!-- management -->
When a stone causes no symptoms, [[watchful waiting]] is a valid option. For symptomatic stones, [[Analgesic|pain control]] is usually the first measure, using medications such as [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s or [[opioid]]s. More severe cases may require surgical intervention. For example, some stones can be shattered into smaller fragments using [[extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy]]. Some cases require more [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|invasive]] forms of surgery. Examples of these are [[Cystoscopy|cystoscopic]] procedures such as [[laser lithotripsy]] or [[percutaneous]] techniques such as [[percutaneous nephrolithotomy]]. Sometimes, a tube ([[Ureteric stent|ureteral stent]]) may be placed in the ureter to bypass the obstruction and alleviate the symptoms, as well as to prevent ureteral stricture after ureteroscopic stone removal.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Pos-renal.png|thumb|Diagram showing the typical location of [[renal colic]],  below the rib cage to just above the [[pelvis]]]]

The hallmark of stones that obstruct the ureter or renal pelvis is excruciating, intermittent pain that radiates from the flank to the groin or to the genital area and inner thigh.<ref name=Cutler2007/> This particular type of pain, known as [[renal colic]], is often described as one of the strongest pain sensations known.<ref name=Wolf2011b/> Renal colic caused by kidney stones is commonly accompanied by [[urinary urgency]], restlessness, [[hematuria]], sweating, nausea, and vomiting. It typically comes in waves lasting 20 to 60 minutes caused by [[Peristalsis|peristaltic]] contractions of the ureter as it attempts to expel the stone.<ref name=Cutler2007/> The [[embryology|embryological]] link between the urinary tract, the [[Reproductive system|genital system]], and the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] is the basis of the radiation of pain to the [[gonads]], as well as the nausea and vomiting that are also common in [[urolithiasis]].<ref name=Pearle2007/> [[Postrenal azotemia]] and hydronephrosis can be observed following the obstruction of urine flow through one or both ureters.<ref name=Cavendish2008/>

==Causes==
Dietary factors that increase the risk of stone formation include [[Dehydration|low fluid intake]] and high dietary intake of animal [[protein]], [[sodium]], refined [[sugar]]s, [[fructose]] and [[high fructose corn syrup]],<ref name=HFCS/> [[oxalate]],<ref name=Johri2010/> [[grapefruit juice]], [[apple juice]], and [[cola]] drinks.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}
[[File:Medical X-Ray imaging UEI07 nevit.jpg|thumb|X-ray with bilateral kidney stones]]

===Calcium===
Calcium is one component of the most common type of human kidney stones, [[calcium oxalate]]. Some studies suggest people who take [[dietary supplement|supplemental calcium]] have a higher risk of developing kidney stones, and these findings have been used as the basis for setting the [[Reference Daily Intake|recommended daily intake]] for calcium in adults.<ref name=IOM2010p8/> In the [[Women's Health Initiative]], postmenopausal women who consumed 1000&nbsp;mg of supplemental calcium and 400&nbsp;[[international unit]]s of [[vitamin D]] per day for seven years had a 17% higher risk of developing kidney stones than subjects taking a [[placebo]].<ref name=IOM2010p413/> The [[Nurses' Health Study]] also showed an association between supplemental calcium intake and kidney stone formation.<ref name=Johri2010/>

Unlike supplemental calcium, high intakes of dietary calcium do not appear to cause kidney stones and may actually protect against their development.<ref name=Johri2010/><ref name=IOM2010p413/> This is perhaps related to the role of calcium in binding ingested oxalate in the gastrointestinal tract. As the amount of calcium intake decreases, the amount of oxalate available for absorption into the bloodstream increases; this oxalate is then excreted in greater amounts into the urine by the kidneys. In the urine, oxalate is a very strong promoter of calcium oxalate precipitation, about 15 times stronger than calcium. In fact, current evidence suggests the consumption of diets low in calcium is associated with a higher overall risk for the development of kidney stones.<ref name=Parmar2004/> For most individuals, other risk factors for kidney stones, such as high intakes of dietary oxalates and low fluid intake, would play a greater role than calcium intake.<ref name=Liebman2011/>

===Other electrolytes===
Aside from calcium, other [[electrolyte]]s appear to influence the formation of kidney stones. For example, by increasing urinary calcium excretion, high dietary sodium may increase the risk of stone formation.<ref name=Johri2010/> [[water fluoridation|Fluoridation of drinking water]] may increase the risk of kidney stone formation by a similar mechanism, though further epidemiologic studies are warranted to determine whether fluoride in drinking water is associated with an increased incidence of kidney stones.<ref name=NAS2006/> On the other hand, high dietary intake of [[potassium]] appears to reduce the risk of stone formation because potassium promotes the urinary excretion of [[citrate]], an inhibitor of urinary crystal formation. High dietary intake of [[magnesium]] also appears to reduce the risk of stone formation somewhat, because like citrate, magnesium is also an inhibitor of urinary crystal formation.<ref name=Johri2010/>

===Animal protein===
[[Western pattern diet|Diets in Western nations]] typically contain a large proportion of animal protein. Urinary excretion of excess sulfurous [[amino acid]]s (e.g., [[cysteine]] and [[methionine]]), uric acid and other acidic [[metabolite]]s from animal protein acidifies the urine, which promotes the formation of kidney stones.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The body often balances this acidic urinary pH by leaching calcium from the bones, which further promotes the formation of kidney stones. Low urinary citrate excretion is also commonly found in those with a high dietary intake of animal protein, whereas vegetarians tend to have higher levels of citrate excretion.<ref name=Johri2010/>

===Vitamins===
Despite a widely held belief in the medical community that ingestion of [[vitamin C]] supplements is associated with an increased [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of kidney stones,<ref name=Goodwin1998/> the evidence for a causal relationship between vitamin C supplements and kidney stones is inconclusive. While excess dietary intake of vitamin C might increase the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation, in practice this is rarely encountered. The link between vitamin D intake and kidney stones is also tenuous. Excessive vitamin D supplementation may increase the risk of stone formation by increasing the intestinal absorption of calcium, but there is no evidence that correction of vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of stone formation.<ref name=Johri2010/>

===Other===
There are no conclusive data demonstrating a cause-and-effect relationship between [[ethanol|alcohol]] consumption and kidney stones. However, some have theorized that certain behaviors associated with frequent and [[binge drinking]] can lead to systemic [[dehydration]], which can in turn lead to the development of kidney stones.<ref name=Rodman1996/> The [[American Urological Association]] has projected that [[global warming|increasing global temperatures]] will lead to an increased incidence of kidney stones in the United States by expanding the "kidney stone belt" of the southern United States.<ref name=Brawer2008/>

==Pathophysiology==

===Supersaturation of urine===
When the urine becomes [[Supersaturation|supersaturated]] (when the urine [[solvent]] contains more [[wikt:Special:Search/solute|solutes]] than it can hold in [[solution]]) with one or more calculogenic (crystal-forming) substances, a [[seed crystal]] may form through the process of [[nucleation]].<ref name=Reilly2005Ch13/> Heterogeneous nucleation (where there is a solid surface present on which a crystal can grow) proceeds more rapidly than homogeneous nucleation (where a crystal must grow in liquid medium with no such surface), because it requires less energy. Adhering to cells on the surface of a [[renal papilla]], a seed crystal can grow and aggregate into an organized mass. Depending on the chemical composition of the crystal, the stone-forming process may proceed more rapidly when the urine pH is unusually high or low.<ref name=Reilly2005Ch14/>

Supersaturation of the urine with respect to a calculogenic compound is pH-dependent. For example, at a pH of 7.0, the solubility of uric acid in urine is 158&nbsp;mg/100&nbsp;ml. Reducing the pH to 5.0 decreases the solubility of uric acid to less than 8&nbsp;mg/100&nbsp;ml. The formation of uric acid stones requires a combination of hyperuricosuria (high urine uric acid levels) and low urine pH; hyperuricosuria alone is not associated with uric acid stone formation if the urine pH is alkaline.<ref name=Knudsen2007/> Supersaturation of the urine is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for the development of any urinary calculus.<ref name=Reilly2005Ch13/> Supersaturation is likely the underlying cause of uric acid and cystine stones, but calcium-based stones (especially calcium oxalate stones) may have a more complex etiology.<ref name=Wolf2011p/>

===Inhibitors of stone formation===
Normal urine contains [[Chelation|chelating]] agents, such as citrate, that inhibit the nucleation, growth, and aggregation of calcium-containing crystals. Other [[Endogeny|endogenous]] inhibitors include [[calgranulin]] (an [[S-100 protein|S-100 calcium binding protein]]), [[Tamm-Horsfall protein]], [[glycosaminoglycan]]s, uropontin (a form of [[osteopontin]]), nephrocalcin (an acidic [[glycoprotein]]), pro[[thrombin]] F1 peptide, and [[Alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor|bikunin]] (uronic acid-rich protein). The biochemical mechanisms of action of these substances have not yet been thoroughly elucidated. However, when these substances fall below their normal proportions, stones can form from an aggregation of crystals.<ref name=Coe2005/>

Kidney stones often result from a combination of factors, rather than a single, well-defined cause. Stones are more common in people whose diet is very high in animal protein or who do not consume enough water or calcium.<ref name=Cutler2007/> They can result from an underlying metabolic condition, such as distal renal tubular acidosis,<ref name=Moe2006/> [[Dent's disease]],<ref name=Thakker2000/> hyperparathyroidism,<ref name=NIDDK2006/> primary hyperoxaluria<ref name=Hoppe2003/> or [[medullary sponge kidney]]. In fact, studies show about 3% to 20% of people who form kidney stones have medullary sponge kidney.<ref name=Reilly2005Ch13/><ref name=NIDDK20086235/> Kidney stones are also more common in people with [[Crohn's disease]].<ref name=NDDIC2006/> People with recurrent kidney stones are often screened for these disorders. This is typically done with a 24-hour urine collection that is chemically analyzed for deficiencies and excesses that promote stone formation.<ref name=Cavendish2008/>

[[File:PstoneUVJ.png|thumb|A stone at the uteral vesicular junction]]
Diagnosis of kidney stones is made on the basis of information obtained from the history, physical examination, urinalysis, and radiographic studies.<ref name=Anoia2009/> Clinical diagnosis is usually made on the basis of the location and severity of the pain, which is typically colicky in nature (comes and goes in spasmodic waves). Pain in the back occurs when calculi produce an obstruction in the kidney.<ref name=Weaver2002/> Physical examination may reveal fever and [[Murphy's punch sign|tenderness at the costovertebral angle]] on the affected side.<ref name=Anoia2009/>

===Imaging studies===
Calcium-containing stones are relatively [[Radiodensity|radiodense]], and they can often be detected by a traditional radiograph of the abdomen that includes the [[kidneys, ureters, and bladder x-ray|kidneys, ureters, and bladder]] (KUB film).<ref name=Pietrow2006/> Some 60% of all renal stones are radiopaque.<ref name=SmithCentennial2000/><ref name=Bushinsky2007/> In general, calcium phosphate stones have the greatest density, followed by calcium oxalate and magnesium ammonium phosphate stones. Cystine calculi are only faintly radiodense, while uric acid stones are usually entirely radiolucent.<ref name=Smith1999/>

Where available, a noncontrast [[Helical cone beam computed tomography|helical CT scan]] with {{convert|5|mm|in|sp=us}} sections is the diagnostic modality of choice in the radiographic evaluation of suspected nephrolithiasis.<ref name=Pearle2007/><ref name=Anoia2009/><ref name=SmithCentennial2000/><ref name=Fang2009/><ref name=Miller2007/> All stones are detectable on CT scans except very rare stones composed of certain drug residues in the urine,<ref name=Pietrow2006/> such as from [[indinavir]].

Where a CT scan is unavailable, an [[intravenous pyelogram]] may be performed to help confirm the diagnosis of urolithiasis. This involves intravenous injection of a [[Radiocontrast|contrast agent]] followed by a KUB film. Uroliths present in the kidneys, ureters or bladder may be better defined by the use of this contrast agent. Stones can also be detected by a [[retrograde pyelogram]], where a similar contrast agent is injected directly into the distal ostium of the ureter (where the ureter terminates as it enters the bladder).<ref name=SmithCentennial2000/>

Ultrasound imaging of the kidneys can sometimes be useful, as it gives details about the presence of hydronephrosis, suggesting the stone is blocking the outflow of urine.<ref name=Pietrow2006/> Radiolucent stones, which do not appear on CT scans, may show up on ultrasound imaging studies. Other advantages of renal ultrasonography include its low cost and absence of [[Radiology|radiation exposure]]. Ultrasound imaging is useful for detecting stones in situations where X-rays or CT scans are discouraged, such as in children or pregnant women.<ref name=Cormier2006/> Despite these advantages, renal ultrasonography is not currently considered a substitute for noncontrast helical CT scan in the initial diagnostic evaluation of urolithiasis.<ref name=Fang2009/> The main reason for this is that compared with CT, renal ultrasonography more often fails to detect small stones (especially ureteral stones), as well as other serious disorders that could be causing the symptoms.<ref name=Cutler2007/>

===Laboratory examination===
[[File:Struvite crystals dog with scale 1.JPG|thumb|left|[[Struvite]] crystals found on [[Urine microscopy|microscopic examination]] of the urine]]

Laboratory investigations typically carried out include:<ref name=Anoia2009/><ref name=Pietrow2006/><ref name=Fang2009/><ref name=NIDDK2007/>
*[[Urine microscopy|microscopic examination]] of the urine, which may show [[red blood cell]]s, bacteria, [[leukocyte]]s, [[urinary cast]]s and crystals;
*urine culture to identify any infecting organisms present in the urinary tract and [[Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing|sensitivity]] to determine the susceptibility of these organisms to specific antibiotics;
*[[complete blood count]], looking for [[neutrophilia]] (increased [[neutrophil granulocyte]] count) suggestive of bacterial infection, as seen in the setting of struvite stones;
*[[renal function]] tests to look for abnormally high blood calcium blood levels ([[Hypercalcaemia|hypercalcemia]]);
*24&nbsp;hour urine collection to measure total daily urinary volume, magnesium, sodium, uric acid, calcium, citrate, oxalate and [[phosphate]];
*collection of stones (by urinating through a StoneScreen kidney stone collection cup or a simple [[tea strainer]]) is useful. Chemical analysis of collected stones can establish their composition, which in turn can help to guide future preventive and therapeutic management.

[[File:Kidney stones, Uric acid.JPG|thumb|Multiple kidney stones composed of [[uric acid]] and a small amount of [[calcium oxalate]]]]

=====Calcium-containing stones=====
By far, the most common type of kidney stones worldwide contains calcium. For example, calcium-containing stones represent about 80% of all cases in the United States; these typically contain [[calcium oxalate]] either alone or in combination with [[calcium phosphate]] in the form of [[apatite]] or [[brushite]].<ref name=Reilly2005Ch13/><ref name=Coe2005/> Factors that promote the [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of oxalate crystals in the urine, such as [[primary hyperoxaluria]], are associated with the development of calcium oxalate stones.<ref name=Hoppe2003/> The formation of calcium phosphate stones is associated with conditions such as [[hyperparathyroidism]]<ref name=NIDDK2006/> and [[renal tubular acidosis]].<ref name=NIDDK20084696/>

Oxaluria is increased in patients with certain gastrointestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn disease or patients who have undergone resection of the small bowel or small bowel bypass procedures.  Oxaluria is also increased in patients who consume increased amounts of oxalate (found in vegetables and nuts). Primary hyperoxaluria is a rare autosomal recessive condition which usually presents in childhood.  <ref> De Mais, Daniel.  ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd Ed. ASCP Press, Chicago, 2009. </ref>


Calcium oxalate stones appear as 'envelopes' microscopically.  They may also form 'dumbbells.'  <ref> De Mais, Daniel.  ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd Ed. ASCP Press, Chicago, 2009. </ref>

=====Struvite stones=====
About 10–15% of urinary calculi are composed of [[struvite]] (ammonium magnesium phosphate, NH<sub>4</sub>MgPO<sub>4</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O).<ref name=Heptinstall2007/> Struvite stones (also known as "infection stones", [[urease]] or triple-phosphate stones), form most often in the presence of infection by urea-splitting [[bacteria]]. Using the enzyme urease, these organisms [[Metabolism|metabolize]] [[urea]] into [[ammonia]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. This [[alkalinity|alkalinizes]] the urine, resulting in favorable conditions for the formation of struvite stones. ''[[Proteus mirabilis]]'', ''[[Proteus vulgaris]]'', and ''[[Morganella morganii]]'' are the most common organisms isolated; less common organisms include ''[[Ureaplasma urealyticum]]'', and some species of ''[[Providencia (bacterium)|Providencia]]'', ''[[Klebsiella]]'', ''[[Serratia]]'', and ''[[Enterobacter]]''. These infection stones are commonly observed in people who have factors that predispose them to [[urinary tract infection]]s, such as those with [[spinal cord injury]] and other forms of [[neurogenic bladder]], [[ileal conduit urinary diversion]], [[vesicoureteral reflux]], and [[Obstructive uropathy|obstructive uropathies]]. They are also commonly seen in people with underlying metabolic disorders, such as [[idiopathic]] [[hypercalciuria]], hyperparathyroidism, and [[gout]]. Infection stones can grow rapidly, forming large calyceal staghorn ([[antler]]-shaped) calculi requiring invasive surgery such as percutaneous nephrolithotomy for definitive treatment.<ref name=Heptinstall2007/>

Struvite stones (triple phosphate/magnesium ammonium phosphate) have a 'coffin lid' morphology by microscopy. <ref> De Mais, Daniel.  ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd Ed. ASCP Press, Chicago, 2009. </ref>

=====Uric acid stones=====
About 5–10% of all stones are formed from uric acid.<ref name=Moe2006/> People with certain metabolic abnormalities, including [[obesity]],<ref name=Johri2010/> may produce uric acid stones. They also may form in association with conditions that cause [[hyperuricosuria]] (an excessive amount of uric acid in the urine) with or without [[hyperuricemia]] (an excessive amount of uric acid in the [[blood serum|serum]]). They may also form in association with disorders of acid/base metabolism where the urine is excessively acidic (low [[pH]]), resulting in precipitation of uric acid crystals. A diagnosis of uric acid urolithiasis is supported by the presence of a [[Radiodensity|radiolucent]] stone in the face of persistent urine acidity, in conjunction with the finding of uric acid crystals in fresh urine samples.<ref name=Halabe1994/>

As noted above (section on calcium oxalate stones), patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis) tend to have hyperoxaluria and form oxalate stones.  These patients also have a tendency to form urate stones.  Urate stones are especially common after colon resection.

Uric acid stones appear as pleomorphic crystals, usually diamond-shaped.  They may also look like squares or rods which are polarizable. <ref> De Mais, Daniel.  ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd. Ed.  ASCP Press, Chicago, 2009. </ref>

Patients with hyperuricosuria can be treated with allopurinol which will reduce urate formation.   Urine alkalinization may also be helpful in this setting.

=====Other types=====
People with certain rare [[Inborn error of metabolism|inborn errors of metabolism]] have a propensity to accumulate crystal-forming substances in their urine. For example, those with [[cystinuria]], [[cystinosis]], and [[Fanconi syndrome]] may form stones composed of [[cystine]]. Cystine stone formation can be treated with urine alkalinization and dietary protein restriction.  People afflicted with [[xanthinuria]] often produce stones composed of [[xanthine]]. People afflicted with [[adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency]] may produce [[2,8-dihydroxyadenine]] stones,<ref name=Kamatani1996/> [[Alkaptonuria|alkaptonurics]] produce [[homogentisic acid]] stones, and [[Iminoglycinuria|iminoglycinurics]] produce stones of [[glycine]], [[proline]] and [[hydroxyproline]].<ref name=Rosenberg1968/><ref name=Coskun1993/> Urolithiasis has also been noted to occur in the setting of therapeutic drug use, with crystals of drug forming within the renal tract in some people currently being treated with agents such as [[indinavir]],<ref name=Crixivan2010/> [[sulfadiazine]]<ref name=Schlossberg2011/> and [[triamterene]].<ref name=Carr1990/>

====Location====
[[File:Staghorn Kidney Stone 08779.jpg|thumb|This radiograph shows a large staghorn calculus involving the [[major calyx|major calyces]] and [[renal pelvis]] in a person with severe [[scoliosis]]. Struvite stones can grow rapidly, forming large [[wikt:calyx|calyceal]] staghorn calculi that can require invasive surgery such as [[percutaneous nephrolithotomy]] or even [[lithotomy|anatrophic nephrolithotomy]] for definitive treatment.]]

Urolithiasis refers to stones originating anywhere in the urinary system, including the kidneys and bladder.<ref name=Pearle2007/> Nephrolithiasis (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] νεφρός (''nephros'', "kidney") and λίθoς (''lithos'', "stone")) refers to the presence of such calculi in the kidneys. Calyceal calculi refers to aggregations in either the [[minor calyx|minor]] or [[major calyx]], parts of the kidney that pass urine into the ureter (the tube connecting the kidneys to the urinary bladder). The condition is called ureterolithiasis when a calculus is located in the ureter. Stones may also form or pass into the bladder, a condition referred to as [[Bladder stone|cystolithiasis]].<ref name=McNutt1893/>

==Prevention==

===Dietary measures===
Specific therapy should be tailored to the type of stones involved. Diet can have a profound influence on the development of kidney stones. Preventive strategies include some combination of dietary modifications and medications with the goal of reducing the excretory load of calculogenic compounds on the kidneys.<ref name=Parmar2004/><ref name=Goldfarb1999/><ref name=Finkielstein2006/> Current dietary recommendations to minimize the formation of kidney stones include:<ref name=Paterson2010/>
* Increasing fluid intake of [[citrate]]-rich foods (especially citrate-rich fluids such as [[lemonade]] and [[orange juice]]), with the objective of increasing [[urine]] output to more than two liters per day
* Attempt to maintain a [[calcium]] (Ca) intake of 1000{{spaced ndash}}1200&nbsp;mg per day
* Limiting [[sodium]] (Na) intake to less than 2300&nbsp;mg per day
* Limiting [[vitamin C]] intake to less than 1000&nbsp;mg per day
* Limiting animal protein intake to no more than two meals daily, with less than {{nowrap|170–230 g}} per day. (A positive association between animal [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]] consumption and recurrence of kidney stones has been shown in men.<ref name=Taylor2006>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=EN|coauthors=Curhan, GC|title=Diet and fluid prescription in stone disease.|journal=Kidney international|date=2006 Sep|volume=70|issue=5|pages=835–9|pmid=16837923|accessdate=27 September 2011|doi=10.1038/sj.ki.5001656}}</ref>)
* Limiting consumption of foods containing high amounts of [[oxalate]] (such as [[spinach]], [[Garden strawberry|strawberries]], [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[rhubarb]], [[wheat germ]], [[Types of chocolate|dark chocolate]], [[Cocoa solids|cocoa]]<!-- correct disambig? -->, brewed [[tea]])

Maintenance of dilute urine by means of vigorous fluid therapy is beneficial in all forms of nephrolithiasis, so increasing urine volume is a key principle for the prevention of kidney stones. Fluid intake should be sufficient to maintain a urine output of at least {{convert|2|l|USoz|abbr=on}} per day.<ref name=Taylor2006 /> A high fluid intake has been associated with a 40% reduction in recurrence risk.<ref name=Fang2009/>

Calcium binds with available oxalate in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby preventing its absorption into the bloodstream, and reducing oxalate absorption decreases kidney stone risk in susceptible people.<ref name=Heaney2006/> Because of this, some [[Nephrology|nephrologist]]s and [[Urology|urologist]]s recommend chewing calcium tablets during meals containing oxalate foods.<ref name=Tiselius2003/> Calcium citrate supplements can be taken with meals if dietary calcium cannot be increased by other means. The preferred calcium supplement for people at risk of stone formation is calcium citrate because it helps to increase urinary citrate excretion.<ref name=Finkielstein2006/>

Aside from vigorous oral hydration and consumption of more dietary calcium, other prevention strategies include avoidance of large doses of supplemental {{nowrap|vitamin C}} and restriction of oxalate-rich foods such as [[List of common leaf vegetables|leaf vegetables]], [[rhubarb]], [[Soybean|soy products]] and [[chocolate]].<ref name=Taylor2004/> However, no randomized, controlled trial of oxalate restriction has yet been performed to test the hypothesis that oxalate restriction reduces the incidence of stone formation.<ref name=Tiselius2003/> Some evidence indicates [[magnesium]] intake decreases the risk of symptomatic nephrolithiasis.<ref name=Taylor2004/>

===Urine alkalinization===
The mainstay for medical management of uric acid stones is alkalinization (increasing the pH) of the urine. Uric acid stones are among the few types amenable to dissolution therapy, referred to as chemolysis. Chemolysis is usually achieved through the use of oral medications, although in some cases, intravenous agents or even instillation of certain irrigating agents directly onto the stone can be performed, using antegrade [[nephrostomy]] or [[retrograde ureteral]] catheters.<ref name=Knudsen2007/> [[Acetazolamide]] (Diamox) is a medication that alkalinizes the urine. In addition to acetazolamide or as an alternative, certain dietary supplements are available that produce a similar alkalinization of the urine. These include [[sodium bicarbonate]], [[potassium citrate]], [[magnesium citrate]], and Bicitra (a combination of citric acid monohydrate and sodium citrate dihydrate). Aside from alkalinization of the urine, these supplements have the added advantage of increasing the urinary citrate level, which helps to reduce the aggregation of calcium oxalate stones.<ref name=Knudsen2007/>

Increasing the urine pH to around 6.5 provides optimal conditions for [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] of uric acid stones. Increasing the urine pH to a value higher than 7.0 increases the risk of calcium phosphate stone formation. Testing the urine periodically with [[nitrazine]] paper can help to ensure the urine pH remains in this optimal range. Using this approach, stone dissolution rate can be expected to be around {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} of stone radius per month.<ref name=Knudsen2007/>

===Diuretics===
One of the recognized medical therapies for prevention of stones is the [[thiazide]] and [[thiazide-like diuretic]]s, such as [[Chlortalidone|chlorthalidone]] or [[indapamide]]. These drugs inhibit the formation of calcium-containing stones by reducing urinary calcium excretion.<ref name=Cutler2007/> Sodium restriction is necessary for clinical effect of thiazides, as sodium excess promotes calcium excretion. Thiazides work best for renal leak hypercalciuria (high urine calcium levels), a condition in which high urinary calcium levels are caused by a primary kidney defect. Thiazides are useful for treating absorptive hypercalciuria, a condition in which high urinary calcium is a result of excess absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.<ref name=Coe2005/>

===Allopurinol===
For people with hyperuricosuria and calcium stones, [[allopurinol]] is one of the few treatments that have been shown to reduce kidney stone recurrences. Allopurinol interferes with the production of uric acid in the [[liver]]. The drug is also used in people with [[gout]] or hyperuricemia (high serum uric acid levels).<ref name=Cameron1987/> Dosage is adjusted to maintain a reduced urinary excretion of uric acid. Serum uric acid level at or below 6&nbsp;mg/100&nbsp;ml) is often a therapeutic goal. Hyperuricemia is not necessary for the formation of uric acid stones; hyperuricosuria can occur in the presence of normal or even [[hypouricemia|low serum uric acid]]. Some practitioners advocate adding allopurinol only in people in whom hyperuricosuria and hyperuricemia persist, despite the use of a urine-alkalinizing agent such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate.<ref name=Knudsen2007/>

==Management==

===Medical===
Stone size influences the rate of spontaneous stone passage. For example, up to 98% of small stones (less than {{convert|5|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter) may pass spontaneously through urination within four weeks of the onset of symptoms,<ref name=Miller2007/> but for larger stones ({{convert|5|to|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter), the rate of spontaneous passage decreases to less than 53%.<ref name=Gettman2005/> Initial stone location also influences the likelihood of spontaneous stone passage. Rates increase from 48% for stones located in the proximal ureter to 79% for stones located at the vesicoureteric junction, regardless of stone size.<ref name=Gettman2005/> Assuming no high-grade obstruction or associated infection is found in the urinary tract, and symptoms are relatively mild, various nonsurgical measures can be used to encourage the passage of a stone.<ref name=Knudsen2007/> Repeat stone formers benefit from more intense management, including proper fluid intake and use of certain medications. In addition, careful surveillance clearly is required to maximize the clinical course for people who are stone formers.<ref name=Macaluso1999/>

====Analgesia====
Management of pain often requires intravenous administration of NSAIDs or opioids.<ref name=Cutler2007/> Orally administered medications are often effective for less severe discomfort.<ref name=Cormier2006/>

====Expulsion therapy====
The use of medications to speed the spontaneous passage of ureteral calculi is referred to as medical expulsive therapy.<ref name=MET09>{{cite journal|last=Seitz|first=C|coauthors=Liatsikos, E, Porpiglia, F, Tiselius, HG, Zwergel, U|title=Medical therapy to facilitate the passage of stones: what is the evidence?|journal=European Urology|date=2009 Sep|volume=56|issue=3|pages=455–71|pmid=19560860|doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2009.06.012}}</ref> Several agents, including [[Alpha blocker|alpha adrenergic blocker]]s (such as [[tamsulosin]]) and [[calcium channel blocker]]s (such as [[nifedipine]]), have been found to be effective.<ref name=MET09/> A combination of tamsulosin and a [[corticosteroid]] may be better than tamsulosin alone.<ref name=MET09/> These treatments also appear to be a useful adjunct to lithotripsy.<ref name=Miller2007/>

===Surgical===
[[File:Lithotriptor machine.jpg|thumb|A [[Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy|lithotriptor machine]] is seen in an [[Operating theater|operating room]]; other equipment is seen in the background, including an [[Anaesthetic machine|anesthesia machine]] and a [[X-ray image intensifier#Mobile Fluoroscopic System AKA "portable C-arm"|mobile fluoroscopic system]] (or "C-arm").]]

Most stones under {{convert|5|mm|in|abbr=on}} pass spontaneously.<ref name=Parmar2004/><ref name=Miller2007/> Prompt surgery may, nonetheless, be required with persons with only one working kidney, bilateral obstructing stones, a urinary tract infection and thus, it is presumed, an infected kidney, or intractable pain.<ref name=Young2011/> Beginning in the mid-1980s, less invasive treatments such as extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, [[ureteroscopy]], and [[percutaneous nephrolithotomy]] began to replace open surgery as the modalities of choice for the surgical management of urolithiasis.<ref name=Miller2007/>  More recently, flexible ureteroscopy has been adapted to facilitate retrograde nephrostomy creation for percutaneous nephrolithotomy.  This approach is still under investigation, though early results are favorable.<ref>Wynberg J, et al.  J Endourol. 2012 Oct;26(10):1268-74.</ref>

====Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy====
{{main|Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy}}
[[Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy]] (ESWL) is a [[noninvasive]] technique for the removal of kidney stones. Most ESWL is carried out when the stone is present near the [[renal pelvis]]. ESWL involves the use of a lithotriptor machine to deliver externally applied, focused, high-intensity pulses of [[ultrasound|ultrasonic energy]] to cause fragmentation of a stone over a period of around 30–60&nbsp;minutes. Following its introduction in United States in February 1984, ESWL was rapidly and widely accepted as a treatment alternative for renal and ureteral stones.<ref name=AUA2009/> It is currently used in the treatment of uncomplicated stones located in the kidney and upper ureter, provided the aggregate stone burden (stone size and number) is less than {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} and the anatomy of the involved kidney is normal.<ref name=Lingeman2007/><ref name=Preminger2007/> For a stone greater than 10&nbsp;mm, ESWL may not help break the stone in one treatment; instead, two or three treatments may be needed. Some 80 to 85% of simple renal calculi can be effectively treated with ESWL.<ref name=Miller2007/> A number of factors can influence its efficacy, including chemical composition of the stone, presence of anomalous renal anatomy and the specific location of the stone within the kidney, presence of hydronephrosis, [[body mass index]], and distance of the stone from the surface of the skin.<ref name=AUA2009/>
Common adverse effects of ESWL include acute [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], such as [[bruise|bruising]] at the site of shock administration, and damage to blood vessels of the kidney.<ref name=Evan1996/><ref name=Evan2007/> In fact, the vast majority of people who are treated with a typical dose of shock waves using currently accepted treatment settings are likely to experience some degree of [[acute kidney injury]].<ref name=AUA2009/> ESWL-induced acute kidney injury is dose-dependent (increases with the total number of shock waves administered and with the power setting of the lithotriptor) and can be severe,<ref name=AUA2009/> including [[internal bleeding]] and subcapsular [[hematoma]]s. On rare occasions, such cases may require [[blood transfusion]] and even lead to acute renal failure. Hematoma rates may be related to the type of lithotriptor used; hematoma rates of less than 1% and up to 13% have been reported for different lithotriptor machines.<ref name=Evan2007/> Recent studies show reduced acute tissue injury when the treatment protocol includes a brief pause following the initiation of treatment, and both improved stone breakage and a reduction in injury when ESWL is carried out at slow shock wave rate.<ref name=AUA2009/>

In addition to the aforementioned potential for acute kidney injury, animal studies suggest these acute injuries may progress to scar formation, resulting in loss of functional renal volume.<ref name=Evan1996/><ref name=Evan2007/> Recent [[Prospective cohort study|prospective studies]] also indicate elderly people are at increased risk of developing new-onset hypertension following ESWL. In addition, a [[Retrospective cohort study|retrospective case-control study]] published by researchers from the [[Mayo Clinic]] in 2006 has found an increased risk of developing [[diabetes mellitus]] and [[hypertension]] in people who had undergone ESWL, compared with age and gender-matched people who had undergone nonsurgical treatment. Whether or not acute trauma progresses to long-term effects probably depends on multiple factors that include the shock wave dose (i.e., the number of shock waves delivered, rate of delivery, power setting, acoustic characteristics of the particular lithotriptor, and frequency of retreatment), as well as certain intrinsic predisposing pathophysiologic risk factors.<ref name=AUA2009/>

To address these concerns, the [[American Urological Association]] established the Shock Wave Lithotripsy Task Force to provide an expert opinion on the safety and [[Risk-benefit analysis|risk-benefit ratio]] of ESWL. The task force published a [[white paper]] outlining their conclusions in 2009. They concluded the risk-benefit ratio remains favorable for many people.<ref name=AUA2009/> The advantages of ESWL include its noninvasive nature, the fact that it is technically easy to treat most upper urinary tract calculi, and that, at least acutely, it is a well-tolerated, low-[[morbidity]] treatment for the vast majority of people. However, they recommended slowing the shock wave firing rate from 120&nbsp;pulses per minute to 60&nbsp;pulses per minute to reduce the risk of renal injury and increase the degree of stone fragmentation.<ref name=AUA2009/>

[[Ureteroscopy]] has become increasingly popular as flexible and rigid [[optical fiber|fiberoptic]] ureteroscopes have become smaller. One ureteroscopic technique involves the placement of a [[Ureteric stent|ureteral stent]] (a small tube extending from the bladder, up the ureter and into the kidney) to provide immediate relief of an obstructed kidney. Stent placement can be useful for saving a kidney at risk for [[Acute kidney injury#Postrenal|postrenal acute renal failure]] due to the increased hydrostatic pressure, [[edema|swelling]] and infection ([[pyelonephritis]] and [[pyonephrosis]]) caused by an obstructing stone. Ureteral stents vary in length from {{convert|24|to|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} and most have a shape commonly referred to as a "double-J" or "double pigtail", because of the curl at both ends. They are designed to allow urine to flow past an obstruction in the ureter. They may be retained in the ureter for days to weeks as infections resolve and as stones are dissolved or fragmented by ESWL or by some other treatment. The stents dilate the ureters, which can facilitate instrumentation, and they also provide a clear landmark to aid in the visualization of the ureters and any associated stones on radiographic examinations. The presence of indwelling ureteral stents may cause minimal to moderate discomfort, frequency or urgency incontinence, and infection, which in general resolves on removal. Most ureteral stents can be removed cystoscopically during an office visit under [[Topical anesthetic|topical anesthesia]] after resolution of the urolithiasis.<ref name=Lam2007/>

More definitive ureteroscopic techniques for stone extraction (rather than simply bypassing the obstruction) include basket extraction and ultrasound ureterolithotripsy. [[Laser lithotripsy]] is another technique, which involves the use of a [[holmium]]:[[yttrium aluminium garnet]] (Ho:YAG) laser to fragment stones in the bladder, ureters, and kidneys.<ref name=Marks2011/>

Ureteroscopic techniques are generally more effective than ESWL for treating stones located in the lower ureter, with success rates of 93–100% using Ho:YAG laser lithotripsy.<ref name=Gettman2005/> Although ESWL has been traditionally preferred by many practitioners for treating stones located in the upper ureter, more recent experience suggests ureteroscopic techniques offer distinct advantages in the treatment of upper ureteral stones. Specifically, the overall success rate is higher, fewer repeat interventions and postoperative visits are needed, and treatment costs are lower after ureteroscopic treatment when compared with ESWL. These advantages are especially apparent with stones greater than {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. However, because ureteroscopy of the upper ureter is much more challenging than ESWL, many urologists still prefer to use ESWL as a first-line treatment for stones of less than 10&nbsp;mm, and ureteroscopy for those greater than 10&nbsp;mm in diameter.<ref name=Gettman2005/> Ureteroscopy is the preferred treatment in pregnant and morbidly obese people, as well as those with [[Bleeding diathesis|bleeding disorders]].<ref name=Miller2007/>

====More invasive operations====
Percutaneous nephrolithotomy or, rarely, [[lithotomy|anatrophic nephrolithotomy]], is the treatment of choice for large or complicated stones (such as calyceal staghorn calculi) or stones that cannot be extracted using less invasive procedures.<ref name=Anoia2009/><ref name=Miller2007/>

==Epidemiology==
Urolithiasis is a significant source of [[morbidity]], affecting all geographical, cultural, and racial groups. The [[Cumulative incidence|lifetime risk]] is about 10 to 15% in the developed world, but can be as high as 20 to 25% in the [[Middle East]]. The increased risk of dehydration in hot climates, coupled with a diet 50% lower in calcium and 250% higher in oxalates compared to Western diets, accounts for the higher net risk in the Middle East.<ref name=Potts2004/> In the Middle East, uric acid stones are more common than calcium-containing stones.<ref name=Reilly2005Ch13/>

In North America and Europe, the annual [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] (number of new cases per year) of kidney stones is roughly 0.5%. In the United States, the [[prevalence]] (frequency in the population) of urolithiasis has increased from 3.2% to 5.2% from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s.<ref name=Moe2006/> The total cost for treating urolithiasis was US$2&nbsp;billion in 2003.<ref name=Pietrow2006/> About 80% of those with kidney stones are men; most stones in women are due to either metabolic defects (such as cystinuria) or infection.<ref name=Heptinstall2007/> Men most commonly experience their first episode between 30 and 40 years of age, whereas for women, the age at first presentation is somewhat later.<ref name=Heptinstall2007/> The age of onset shows a [[bimodal distribution]] in women, with episodes peaking at 35 and 55 years.<ref name=Pietrow2006/> Recurrence rates are estimated at 50% over a 10-year and 75% over 20-year period,<ref name=Moe2006/> with some people experiencing ten or more episodes over the course of a lifetime.<ref name=Heptinstall2007/>

==History==
{{See also|List of kidney stone formers}}
The existence of kidney stones was first recorded thousands of years ago, and [[lithotomy]] for the removal of stones is one of the earliest known surgical procedures.<ref name=Eknoyan2004/> In 1901, a stone discovered in the [[pelvis]] of an ancient Egyptian [[mummy]] was dated to 4,800&nbsp;BC. Medical texts from ancient [[Mesopotamia]], [[History of India|India]], [[History of China|China]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] all mentioned calculous disease. Part of the [[Hippocratic Oath]] suggests there were practicing surgeons in ancient Greece to whom physicians were to defer for lithotomies. The Roman medical treatise ''[[De Medicina]]'' by [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] contained a description of lithotomy,<ref name=Collier1831/> and this work served as the basis for this procedure until the 18th century.<ref name=Shah2002/>

Famous people who were [[List of kidney stone formers|kidney stone formers]] include [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]], [[Napoleon III]], [[Peter the Great]], [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Isaac Newton]], [[Samuel Pepys]], [[William Harvey]], [[Herman Boerhaave]], and [[Antonio Scarpa]].<ref name=Ellis1969/>

New techniques in lithotomy began to emerge starting in 1520, but the operation remained risky. After [[Henry Jacob Bigelow]] popularized the technique of [[litholapaxy]] in 1878,<ref name=Bigelow1878/> the [[mortality rate]] dropped from about 24% to 2.4%. However, other treatment techniques continued to produce a high level of mortality, especially among inexperienced urologists.<ref name=Shah2002/><ref name=Ellis1969/> In 1980, [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier MedTech]] introduced extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for breaking up stones via acoustical pulses, and this technique has since come into widespread use.<ref name=AUA2009/>

==Research directions==
[[Crystallization]] of calcium oxalate appears to be inhibited by certain substances in the urine that retard the formation, growth, aggregation, and adherence of crystals to renal cells. By purifying urine using [[Protein precipitation|salt precipitation]], [[isoelectric focusing]], and [[size-exclusion chromatography]], some researchers have found that [[calgranulin]], a protein formed in the kidney, is a potent inhibitor of the ''[[in vivo]]'' formation of calcium oxalate crystals. Considering its extremely high levels of inhibition of growth and aggregation of calcium oxalate crystals, calgranulin might be an important intrinsic factor in the prevention of nephrolithiasis.<ref name=Coe2008/>
