==History==
Tuality Healthcare’s beginning starts in 1918 when Minnie Jones Coy started a small [[hospital]] in Hillsboro.<ref name=THC>[http://www.tuality.org/workfiles/AboutUs/history.pdf Tuality Healthcare history highlights.] Tuality Healthcare. Retrieved on March 31, 2008.</ref> Over the next 65 years that hospital expanded to nearly 100 hospital beds, and in 1982 purchased an additional hospital in [[Forest Grove, Oregon]]. Then in 1983 the community ownership group formed Fontus as a healthcare organization. This organization comprised the two hospitals and the Tuality Medical Foundation.<ref name=THC/>
