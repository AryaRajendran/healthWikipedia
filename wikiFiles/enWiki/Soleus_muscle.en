In humans and some other mammals, the '''soleus''' is a powerful [[muscle]] in the back part of the lower [[leg]] (the [[Calf (anatomy)|calf]]).   It runs from just below the [[knee]] to the [[heel]], and is involved in standing and walking. It is closely connected to the [[gastrocnemius muscle]] and some anatomists consider them to be a single muscle, the [[triceps surae muscle|triceps surae]]. Its name is derived from the Latin word, "solea," meaning "[[sandal]]."

The soleus is located in the superficial [[posterior compartment of leg|posterior compartment of the leg]].  Not all mammals have a soleus muscle; one familiar species that lacks the soleus is the [[dog]]. Soleus is vestigial in the horse.<ref>{{cite journal

The soleus exhibits significant morphological differences across species. It is [[Unipennate muscle|unipennate]] in many species. In some animals, such as the rabbit, it is fused for much of its length with the gastrocnemius muscle. In the human, soleus is a complex multi-pennate muscle, usually having a separate (posterior) aponeurosis from the gastrocnemius muscle. A majority of soleus muscle fibers originate from each side of the anterior aponeurosis, attached to the tibia and fibula.[2][3] Other fibers originate from the posterior (back) surfaces of the head of the fibula and its upper quarter, as well as the middle third of the medial border of the tibia.
 
The fibers originating from the anterior surface of the anterior aponeurosis insert onto the median septum and the fibers originating from the posterior surface of the anterior aponeurosis insert onto the posterior aponeurosis.[2][3] The posterior aponeurosis and median septum join in the lower quarter of the muscle and then join with the anterior aponeuroses of the gastrocnemius muscles to form the calcaneal tendon or Achilles tendon and inserts onto the posterior surface of the calcaneus, or heel bone.
 
In contrast to some animals, the human soleus and gastrocnemius muscles are relatively separate, such that shear can be detected between the soleus and gastrocnemius aponeuroses. [4]

== Relations ==

Superficial to the soleus (closer to the skin) is the gastrocnemius muscle.

The [[plantaris muscle]] and a portion of its tendon run between the two muscles. Deep to it (farther from the skin) is the [[transverse intermuscular septum]], which separates the superficial posterior compartment of the leg from the deep posterior compartment.

On the other side of the fascia are the [[tibialis posterior muscle]], the [[flexor digitorum longus muscle]], and the [[flexor hallucis longus muscle]], along with the [[posterior tibial artery]] and [[posterior tibial vein]] and the [[tibial nerve]].

Since the anterior compartment of the leg is lateral to the tibia, the bulge of muscle medial to the tibia on the anterior side is actually the posterior compartment. The soleus is superficial middle of the tibia.

== Function ==

The action of the calf muscles, including the soleus, is [[plantarflexion]] of the foot (that is, they increase the angle between the foot and the leg). They are powerful muscles and are vital in walking, running, and dancing. The soleus specifically plays an important role in maintaining standing posture; if not for its constant pull, the body would fall forward.

Also, in upright posture, it is responsible for pumping ''venous'' blood back into the heart from the periphery, and is often called the [[skeletal-muscle pump]], ''peripheral heart'' or the ''sural (tricipital) pump''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Botta G, Piccinetti A, Giontella M, Mancini S |year=2001 |volume=27 |pages=84–8 |title=Il potenziamento dell’attività di pompa venosa del tricipite surale in ortopedia e traumatologia mediante l’utilizzo di una nuova apparecchiatura di ginnastica vascolare |trans_title=Strengthening of venous pump activity of the sural tricipital in orthopaedics and traumatology by means of a new equipment for vascular exercise |language=Italian |url=http://www.giot.it/articoli/2001/vol3-01/084art.pdf |journal=Giornale Italiano di Ortopedia e Traumatologia}}</ref>

Soleus muscles have a higher proportion of slow muscle fibers than many other muscles. In some animals, such as the guinea pig and cat, soleus consists of 100% slow muscle fibers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ariano MA, Armstrong RB, Edgerton VR |title=Hindlimb muscle fiber populations of five mammals |journal=The Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=51–5 |year=1973 |month=January |pmid=4348494 |url=http://www.jhc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=4348494 |doi=10.1177/21.1.51}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Burke RE, Levine DN, Salcman M, Tsairis P |title=Motor units in cat soleus muscle: physiological, histochemical and morphological characteristics |journal=The Journal of Physiology |volume=238 |issue=3 |pages=503–14 |year=1974 |month=May |pmid=4277582 |pmc=1330899 |url=http://www.jphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=4277582}}</ref> Human soleus fiber composition is quite variable, containing between 60 and 100% slow fibers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gollnick PD, Sjödin B, Karlsson J, Jansson E, Saltin B |title=Human soleus muscle: a comparison of fiber composition and enzyme activities with other leg muscles |journal=Pflügers Archiv |volume=348 |issue=3 |pages=247–55 |year=1974 |month=April |pmid=4275915 |doi=10.1007/BF00587415}}</ref>
