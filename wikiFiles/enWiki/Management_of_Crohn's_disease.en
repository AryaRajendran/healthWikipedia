'''Management of [[Crohn's disease]]''' involves first treating the [[acute (medical)|acute]] symptoms of the disease, then maintaining [[Remission (medicine)|remission]]. Treatment initially involves the use of [[medication]]s to eliminate [[infection]]s, generally  [[antibiotic]]s, and reduce [[inflammation]], generally [[5-Aminosalicylic acid|aminosalicylate]] anti-inflammatory drugs and [[corticosteroid]]s. [[Surgery]] may be required for complications such as obstructions or abscesses, or if the disease does not respond to drugs within a reasonable time.

Once remission is induced, the goal of treatment becomes maintenance of remission, avoiding the return of active disease, or "flares". Because of side-effects, the prolonged use of corticosteroids is avoided. Although some people are able to maintain remission with aminosalicylates alone, many require immunosuppressive drugs.<ref name=Hanauer2001>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2001.03671.x |title=Management of Crohn's disease in adults |year=2001 |last1=Hanauer |first1=Stephen B. |last2=Sandborn |first2=William |journal=The American Journal of Gastroenterology |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=635–43 |pmid=11280528 |author3=Practice Parameters Committee of the American College of Gastroenterology}}</ref>

==Aminosalicylate anti-inflammatory drugs==

5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA) include the following:
*[[Mesalazine]] or mesalamine, which is marketed in the forms Lialda, Asacol, Pentasa, Salofalk, Dipentum and Rowasa.
*[[Sulfasalazine]], which is converted to 5-ASA and sulfapyridine by intestinal bacteria. The sulfapyridine may have some therapeutic effect in rheumatoid arthritis. However, the sulfapyridine component is often the limiting factor in treatment of Crohn's disease because of high side-effect profile.
5-ASA compounds have been shown to be useful in the treatment of mild-to-moderate Crohn's disease.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1542-3565(04)00122-3 |title=Oral pentasa in the treatment of active Crohn?s disease: A meta-analysis of double-blind, placebo-controlled trials |year=2004 |last1=Hanauer |first1=S |journal=Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=379–88 |pmid=15118975 |last2=Strömberg |first2=U}}</ref>  They are usually considered to be first line therapy for disease in the [[ileum]] and right side of the colon particularly due to their lower side effect profile compared to corticosteroids.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0016-5085(99)70172-1 |title=Mesalamine in the treatment of mild to moderate active Crohn's ileitis: Results of a randomized, multicenter trial |year=1999 |last1=Prantera |first1=Cosimo |last2=Cottone |first2=Mario |last3=Pallone |first3=Francesco |last4=Annese |first4=Vito |last5=Franzè |first5=Angelo |last6=Cerutti |first6=Renata |last7=Porro |first7=Gabriele Bianchi |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=521–6 |pmid=10029609}}.</ref>

==Corticosteroid anti-inflammatory drugs==
[[Image:Cortifoam.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Steroid [[enema]]s can be used for treatment of rectal disease symptoms]]

'''[[Corticosteroid]]s''' are a class of anti-inflammatory drug that are used primarily for treatment of moderate to severe flares of Crohn's disease.  They are used more sparingly due to the availability of effective treatments with fewer side-effects.<ref name=emed/>  The side effects of corticosteroids include [[Cushing's syndrome]], [[mania]], [[insomnia]], [[hypertension]], high blood [[glucose]], [[osteoporosis]], and [[avascular necrosis]] of long bones. These should not be confused with the [[anabolic steroid]]s used to enhance athletic performance.

The most commonly prescribed oral steroid is [[prednisone]], which is typically dosed at 0.5&nbsp;mg/kg for induction of remission.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1679735 |year=1991 |last1=Hanauer |first1=SB |title=Sulfasalazine vs. Steroids in Crohn's disease: David vs. Goliath? |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=1130–1 |journal=Gastroenterology}}</ref>  Intravenous steroids are used for cases refractory to oral steroids, or where oral steroids cannot be taken.<ref name=emed>{{cite web |first1=Latha |last1=Gopal |first2=Senthil |last2=Nachimuthu |editor1-first=Julian |editor1-last=Katz |publisher=WebMD |title=Crohn Disease |url=http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic477.htm |accessdate=July 7, 2012 |date=June 16, 2011}}</ref>  These are administered in the hospital setting.  Because corticosteroids reduce the ability to fight [[infection]], care must be used to ensure that there is no active infection, particularly an intra-abdominal [[abscess]] before the initiation of steroids.

[[Budesonide]] is an oral corticosteroid with limited absorption and high level of first-pass [[metabolism]], meaning that less quantities of steroid enter into the bloodstream.  It has been shown to be useful in the treatment of mild-to-moderate Crohn's disease<ref name=Gordo>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199409293311303 |title=Oral Budesonide for Active Crohn's Disease |year=1994 |last1=Greenberg |first1=Gordon R. |last2=Feagan |first2=Brian G. |last3=Martin |first3=Francois |last4=Sutherland |first4=Lloyd R. |last5=Thomson |first5=Alan |last6=Williams |first6=C.

[[Budesonide]] is also useful when used in combination with [[antibiotic]]s for active Crohn's disease.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1053/gast.2002.34225 |title=Combined budesonide and antibiotic therapy for active Crohn's disease: A randomized controlled trial |year=2002 |last1=Steinhart |first1=A |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=123 |pages=33–40 |pmid=12105831 |last2=Feagan |first2=BG |last3=Wong |first3=CJ |last4=Vandervoort |first4=M |last5=Mikolainis |first5=S |last6=Croitoru |first6=K |last7=Seidman |first7=E |last8=Leddin |first8=DJ |last9=Bitton |first9=A |issue=1}}.</ref>

Steroid enemas can also be used for disease of the lower colon and [[rectum]], in order to treat symptoms.  [[Hydrocortisone]] and budesonide liquid and foam enemas are being marketed for these reasons.

[[Corticosteroid]]s however have a host of side effects, some very serious, and it is desirable to curtail their use whenever possible.

==Mercaptopurine immunosuppressing drugs==
[[Image:Imuran 2.JPG|right|thumb|150px|[[Azathioprine]], shown here in tablet form, is a first line steroid-sparing immunosuppressant]]

[[Azathioprine]] and [[6-mercaptopurine]] (6-MP) are the most used immunosuppressants for maintenance therapy of Crohn's disease.  They are [[purine]] anti-metabolites, meaning that they interfere with the synthesis of purines required for [[leukocyte|inflammatory cells]].  They have a duration of action of months, making it unwieldy to use them for induction of remission.  Both drugs are dosed at 1.5 to 2.5&nbsp;mg/kg, with literature supporting the use of higher doses.<ref name=Podolsky>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMra020831 |title=Inflammatory Bowel Disease |year=2002 |last1=Podolsky |first1=Daniel K. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=347 |issue=6 |pages=417–29 |pmid=12167685}}</ref>

Azathioprine and 6-MP have been found to be useful for the following indications:
*For maintenance therapy for people who are dependent on steroids.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01070829 |title=A controlled trial of azathioprine in Crohn's disease |year=1975 |last1=Rosenberg |first1=James L. |last2=Levin |first2=Bernard |last3=Wall |first3=Alfred J. |last4=Kirsner |first4=Joseph B. |journal=The American Journal of Digestive Diseases |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=721–6 |pmid=1098449}}</ref>

[[Azathioprine]] is however a particularly dangerous drug, with great potential for inviting a host of potentially fatal infections, and is also listed by the FDA as a human [[carcinogen]]; however, it confers considerably less morbidity and mortality than corticosteroids.

==Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors==

===Infliximab===

[[Infliximab]], marketed as '''Remicade''', is a mouse-human [[Chimera (protein)|chimeric antibody]] that targets [[tumour necrosis factor]], a [[cytokine]] in the inflammatory response.  It is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha. It is administered intravenously and dosed per weight starting at 5&nbsp;mg/kg and increasing according to character of disease.

Infliximab has found utility as follows:
*Maintenance of remission for people with Crohn's disease.<ref name=Accent1>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08512-4 |title=Maintenance infliximab for Crohn's disease: The ACCENT I randomised trial |year=2002 |last1=Hanauer |first1=Stephen B |last2=Feagan |first2=Brian G |last3=Lichtenstein |first3=Gary R |last4=Mayer |first4=Lloyd F |last5=Schreiber |first5=S |last6=Colombel |first6=Jean Frederic |last7=Rachmilewitz |first7=Daniel |last8=Wolf |first8=Douglas C |last9=Olson |first9=Allan |journal=The Lancet |volume=359 |issue=9317 |pages=1541–9 |pmid=12047962}}</ref>

Side effects of [[infliximab]], like other [[immunosuppressant]]s of the [[Tumor necrosis factors|TNF]] class, can be serious and potentially fatal, and [[infliximab]] carries an FDA [[Black box warning|black-box]] warning on the label. Listed side effects include [[hypersensitivity]] and [[allergy|allergic]] reactions, risk of re-activation of [[tuberculosis]], [[serum sickness]], and risk of [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.02786.x |title=Review article: Infliximab therapy for inflammatory bowel disease - seven years on |year=2006 |last1=Rutgeerts |first1=P. |last2=Assche |first2=G. |last3=Vermeire |first3=S. |journal=Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=451–63 |pmid=16441465}}</ref> Serious side effect also include [[lymphoma]] and severe [[infections]].

===Adalimumab===

[[Adalimumab]], marketed as '''Humira''', like infliximab is an antibody that targets [[tumour necrosis factor]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2005.11.030 |title=Human Anti–Tumor Necrosis Factor Monoclonal Antibody (Adalimumab) in Crohn's Disease: The CLASSIC-I Trial |year=2006 |last1=Hanauer |first1=Stephen B. |last2=Sandborn |first2=William J. |last3=Rutgeerts |first3=Paul |last4=Fedorak |first4=Richard N. |last5=Lukas |first5=Milan |last6=MacIntosh |first6=Donald |last7=Panaccione |first7=Remo |last8=Wolf |first8=Douglas |last9=Pollack |first9=Paul |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=130 |issue=2 |pages=323–33; quiz 591 |pmid=16472588}}</ref>
Adalimumab has been shown to reduce the signs and symptoms of, and is approved for treatment of, moderate to severe [[Crohn's disease]] (CD) in adults who have not responded well to conventional treatments and who have lost response to, or are unable to tolerate [[infliximab]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rxabbott.com/pdf/humira_medguide.pdf | title = Medication guide:  Humira | accessdate = 2008-03-25 | date = 2008-02-01 | format = pdf | publisher = [[Abbott Laboratories]]}}</ref>

[[Adalimumab]] also has a number of serious, potentially fatal, safety concerns characteristic of the anti-TNFα drugs. It too has a [[black box warning]] on its FDA label. Listed potential side effects include serious and sometimes fatal blood disorders; serious [[infection]]s including TB ([[tuberculosis]]) and infections caused by viruses, fungi, or bacteria; rare reports of [[lymphoma]] and solid tissue [[cancer]]s; rare reports of serious [[liver]] injury; and rare reports of [[demyelinating]] [[central nervous system]] disorders); and rare reports of cardiac failure.

===Natalizumab===

[[Natalizumab]], marketed as '''Tysabri''', is an anti-[[integrin]] [[Monoclonal antibodies|monoclonal antibody]] that has shown utility as induction and maintenance treatment for moderate to severe Crohn's disease.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa043335 |title=Natalizumab Induction and Maintenance Therapy for Crohn's Disease |year=2005 |last1=Sandborn |first1=William J. |last2=Colombel |first2=Jean Frédéric |last3=Enns |first3=Roberts |last4=Feagan |first4=Brian G. |last5=Hanauer |first5=Stephen B. |last6=Lawrance |first6=Ian C. |last7=Panaccione |first7=Remo |last8=Sanders |first8=Martin |last9=Schreiber |first9=Stefan |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=353 |issue=18 |pages=1912–25 |pmid=16267322}}</ref> [[Natalizumab]] may be appropriate in patients who do not respond to medications that block [[tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] such as [[infliximab]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000111023 |title=Severe and Steroid-Resistant Crohn's Disease |year=2007 |last1=Michetti |first1=Pierre |last2=Mottet |first2=Christian |last3=Juillerat |first3=Pascal |last4=Pittet |first4=Val&Eacute;rie |last5=Felley |first5=Christian |last6=Vader |first6=John-Paul |last7=Gonvers |first7=Jean-Jacques |last8=Froehlich |first8=Florian |journal=Digestion |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=99–108 |pmid=18239400}}</ref>  

In January 2008, the FDA approved natalizumab for both induction of remission and maintenance of remission for moderate to severe Crohn's disease.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2008/NEW01775.html | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration]] | title = FDA Approves Tysabri to Treat Moderate-to-Severe Crohn's Disease  | date = 2008-01-14 | accessdate = 2008-03-09 }}</ref>

A total of 3 large [[randomized controlled trial]]s have demonstrated that natalizumab is effective in increasing rates of [[remission (medicine)|remission]]<ref name="pmid12510039">{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa020732 |title=Natalizumab for Active Crohn's Disease |year=2003 |last1=Ghosh |first1=Subrata |last2=Goldin |first2=Eran |last3=Gordon |first3=Fiona H. |last4=Malchow |first4=Helmut A. |last5=Rask-Madsen |first5=Jørgen |last6=Rutgeerts |first6=Paul |last7=Vyhnálek |first7=Petr |last8=Zádorová |first8=Zdena |last9=Palmer |first9=Tanya |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=348 |pages=24–32 |pmid=12510039 |issue=1}}</ref> and maintaining symptom-free status<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2007.01508.x |title=Health-Related Quality of Life During Natalizumab Maintenance Therapy for Crohn's Disease |year=2007 |last1=Feagan |first1=Brian G. |last2=Sandborn |first2=William J. |last3=Hass |first3=Steven |last4=Niecko |first4=Timothy |last5=White |first5=Jeffrey |journal=The American Journal of Gastroenterology |volume=102 |issue=12 |pages=2737–46 |pmid=18042106}}</ref> in patients with Crohn's disease.

== Surgery ==
Surgery is normally reserved for complications of Crohn's disease or when disease that resists treatment with drugs is confined to one location that can be removed.<ref name=Hanauer>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199603283341307 |title=Inflammatory Bowel Disease |year=1996 |last1=Wood |first1=Alastair J.J. |last2=Hanauer |first2=Stephen B. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=334 |issue=13 |pages=841–8 |pmid=8596552}}</ref> Surgery is often used to manage complications of Crohn's disease, including [[fistula]]e, small [[bowel obstruction]], [[colon cancer]], [[small intestine cancer]] and fibrostenotic [[Stenosis|strictures]], when [[strictureplasty]] (expansion of the stricture) is sometimes performed. Otherwise, and for other complications, [[Segmental resection|resection]] and anastomosis – the removal of the affected section of intestine and the rejoining of the healthy sections – is the surgery usually performed for Crohn's disease (e.g., [[Colectomy|ileocolonic resection]]). Neither type of surgery cures Crohn's disease, as recurrence often reappears in previously unaffected areas of the intestine.<ref name=CCFA-surgery>{{cite web| url=http://www.ccfa.org/info/surgery/surgerycd| title=Surgery for Crohn's Disease| year=2006| month=March| accessdate=2006-06-08 |publisher=Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America}}</ref>

Small intestine [[Organ transplant|transplants]] are still experimental, and are usually only done when there is a risk of [[short bowel syndrome]] due to repeated resection surgeries.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

== Diet and lifestyle ==

Many [[diet (nutrition)|diets]] have been proposed for treatment of Crohn's disease, and many do improve symptoms, but none have been proven to actually cure Crohn's disease.<ref>

[[Specific Carbohydrate Diet]] usually needs adjustments for patients so that they can handle the diet.
If a patient finds that certain foods increase or decrease the symptoms, then they may adjust their diet accordingly. A food diary is recommended to see what positive or negative effects particular foods have. 
A [[low residue diet]] may be used to reduce the volume of stools excreted daily.  People with [[lactose intolerance]] due to small bowel disease may benefit from avoiding [[lactose]]-containing foods.   Patients who cannot eat are recommended to take total parenteral nutrition (TPN) - a source of vitamins and nutrients. 

[[Fish oil]] has been found to be effective in reducing the chance of relapse in less severe cases.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199606133342401 |title=Effect of an Enteric-Coated Fish-Oil Preparation on Relapses in Crohn's Disease |year=1996 |last1=Belluzzi |first1=Andrea |last2=Brignola |first2=Corrado |last3=Campieri |first3=Massimo |last4=Pera |first4=Angelo |last5=Boschi |first5=Stefano |last6=Miglioli |first6=Mario |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=334 |issue=24 |pages=1557–60 |pmid=8628335}}</ref>

Because the terminal ileum is the most common site of involvement and is the site for [[Cyanocobalamin|vitamin B{{ssub|12}}]] absorption, people with Crohn's disease are at risk for B{{ssub|12}} deficiency and may need supplementation.  In cases with extensive small intestine involvement, the fat soluble vitamins [[Retinol|A]], [[Vitamin D|D]], [[Tocopherol|E]] and [[Naphthoquinone|K]] can be deficient. [[Folate deficiency]] is a risk when being treated with methotrexate.

Stress can influence the course of Crohn's disease. Conversely, stress is likely to be caused by the flaring up of the disease and this would make day to day life more difficult.

Smoking has also been noted to have an association with Crohn's, and smokers with Crohn's are encouraged to quit.

==Helminthic therapy==
In an experimental idea called [[Helminthic therapy]], moderate [[hookworm]] infections have been demonstrated to have beneficial effects on hosts suffering from diseases linked to overactive immune systems.  This is possibly explained by the [[hygiene hypothesis]].
