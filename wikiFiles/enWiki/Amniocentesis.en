'''Amniocentesis''' (also referred to as '''amniotic fluid test''' '''or AFT''') is a medical procedure<ref>The word ''amniocentesis'' itself indicates precisely the procedure in question, [[Ancient Greek|Gr.]] ἀμνίον ''amníon'' being the "inner membrane round the foetus" and κέντησις ''kéntēsis'' meaning "pricking", i.e. its puncture in order to retrieve some [[amniotic fluid]].</ref> used in [[prenatal diagnosis]] of [[Chromosome abnormality|chromosomal abnormalities]] and fetal infections,<ref name="harvard">{{cite web|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/diagnostic-tests/amniosentesis.htm|title=Diagnostic Tests – Amniocentesis|publisher=Harvard Medical School|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref> in which a small amount of amniotic fluid, which contains fetal tissues, is [[sampling (medicine)|sampled]] from the [[amnion]] or amniotic sac surrounding a developing [[fetus]], and the fetal DNA is examined for genetic abnormalities. Developed by Richard Dedrick, this process can be used for [[prenatal sex discernment]] and hence this procedure has legal restrictions in some  countries.

==Procedure==
Before the start of the procedure, a  local anesthetic can be given to the mother in order to relieve the pain felt during the insertion of the needle used to withdraw the fluid. After the local is in effect, a needle is usually inserted through the mother's abdominal wall, then through the wall of the uterus, and finally into the amniotic sac. With the aid of ultrasound-guidance, a physician punctures the sac in an area away from the fetus and extracts approximately 20&nbsp;ml of amniotic fluid. 

If used for [[prenatal genetic diagnosis]], fetal cells are separated from the extracted sample. The cells are grown in a culture medium, then fixed and [[staining|stained]]. Under a microscope the chromosomes are examined for abnormalities. The most common abnormalities detected are [[Down syndrome]] (trisomy 21), [[Edwards syndrome]] (trisomy 18), and [[Turner syndrome]] (monosomy X). In regard to the fetus, the puncture heals and the amniotic sac replenishes the liquid over the next 24–48 hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prenatal diagnostic testing|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/womens_health_issues/genetic_disorders_detection/prenatal_diagnostic_testing.html#v808991|date=Last revision 2008|author=Jeffrey S.

==Indications and results==

===Genetic diagnosis===
Early in pregnancy, amniocentesis used for diagnosis of chromosomal and other fetal problems such as:
* [[Down syndrome]] (trisomy 21)
* [[Trisomy 13]]
* [[Trisomy 18]]
* [[Fragile X]]
* Rare, inherited metabolic disorders
* [[Neural tube defect]]s ([[anencephaly]] and [[spina bifida]]) by [[alpha-fetoprotein]] levels.<ref>{{cite web |first= Jeffrey S. |last= Dungan |coauthors= Elias, Sherman |title= Prenatal Diagnostic Testing |work= The Merck Manuals Online Medical Library |date= November 2008 | url = http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec22/ch256/ch256c.html |accessdate= July 30, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100804095618/http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec22/ch256/ch256c.html| archivedate= 4 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Lung maturity===
Amniocentesis can predict fetal lung maturity, which is inversely correlated to the risk of [[infant respiratory distress syndrome]]. In pregnancies of greater than 30 weeks, the fetal lung maturity may be tested by sampling the amount of surfactant in the amniotic fluid. Several tests are available that correlate with the production of surfactant.  These include the [[lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio]] ("[[L/S ratio]]"), the presence of [[phosphatidylglycerol]] (PG), and more recently, the  [[surfactant-albumin ratio|surfactant/albumin (S/A) ratio]]. For the [[L/S ratio]], if the result is less than 2:1, the fetal lungs may be surfactant deficient.  The presence of PG usually indicates fetal lung maturity.  For the S/A ratio, the result is given as mg of surfactant per gm of protein.  An S/A ratio <35 indicates immature lungs, between 35-55 is indeterminate, and >55 indicates mature surfactant production(correlates with an L/S ratio of 2.2 or greater).

===Other===
Amniocentesis can also  be used to detect problems such as:
* Infection, in which amniocentesis can detect a decreased glucose level, a [[Gram stain]] showing bacteria or an abnormal [[Complete_blood_count#White_cells|differential count of white blood cells]].<ref name=Medina2006>{{cite pmid|16506709}}</ref>
* Rh incompatibility
* Decompression of polyhydramnios

An emerging indication for amniocentesis is in the management of preterm rupture of membranes where measurement of certain amniotic fluid inflammatory markers may be helpful. If amniotic fluid IL-6, a marker of inflammation, is elevated, the fetus is at high risk and delivery should be considered.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S096553951000001X|title=Pre-Term Pre-Labour Rupture of Membranes and the Role of Amniocentesis|year=2010|last1=Kenyon|first1=Anna P|last2=Abi-Nader|first2=Khalil N|last3=Pandya|first3=Pranav P|journal=Fetal and Maternal Medicine Review|volume=21|issue=2|pages=75}}</ref>

==Risks and drawbacks==
Amniocentesis is performed between the 15th and 20th week of pregnancy; performing this test earlier may result in fetal injury.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Seeds|first=JW|title=Diagnostic mid trimester amniocentesis: how safe?|journal=American journal of obstetrics and gynecology|date=2004 Aug|year=2004|month=August|volume=191|issue=2|pages=607–15|pmid=15343248|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15343248}}</ref> The term "early amniocentesis" is sometimes used to describe use of the process between weeks 11 and 13.<ref name="pmid9291904">{{cite journal |author=Sundberg K |title=Randomised study of risk of fetal loss related to early amniocentesis versus chorionic villus sampling |journal=Lancet |volume=350 |issue=9079 |pages=697–703 |year=1997 |month=September |pmid=9291904 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)02449-5 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(97)02449-5 |author-separator=, |author2=Bang J |author3=Smidt-Jensen S |display-authors=3 |last4=Brocks |first4=V |last5=Lundsteen |first5=C |last6=Parner |first6=J |last7=Keiding |first7=N |last8=Philip |first8=J}}</ref>

Complications of amniocentesis include [[premature birth|preterm labor]] and delivery, [[respiratory distress]], postural deformities, [[chorioamnionitis]], fetal trauma and alloimmunisation of the mother ([[rhesus disease]]). Studies from the 1970s originally estimated the risk of amniocentesis-related miscarriage at around 1 in 200 (0.5%).<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.webmd.com/content/article/129/117333.htm Amniocentesis Risk Overrated?]. Webmd.com (2006-11-01). Retrieved on 2011-11-22.</ref> Three more recent studies from 2000-2006 estimated the procedure-related pregnancy loss at 0.6-0.86%.<ref name="SOGC committee opinion">[http://www.sogc.org/guidelines/documents/gui194CPG0707.pdf]. Committee opinion, Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.</ref> A more recent study (2006) has indicated this may actually be much lower, perhaps as low as 1 in 1,600 (0.06%).<ref>{{cite journal |title=Pregnancy loss rates after midtrimester amniocentesis |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=108 |issue=5 |pages=1067–72 |year=2006|pmid=17077226 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000240135.13594.07 |last1=Eddleman |first1=Keith A. |last2=Malone |first2=Fergal D. |last3=Sullivan |first3=Lisa |last4=Dukes |first4=Kim |last5=Berkowitz |first5=Richard L. |last6=Kharbutli |first6=Yara |last7=Porter |first7=T Flint |last8=Luthy |first8=David A. |last9=Comstock |first9=Christine H.}}</ref> Unlike the previous studies, the number in this study only reflects the loss that resulted from amniocentesis complications and excluded the cases when parents decided for an abortion following the test results.<ref name="SOGC committee opinion"/> In contrast to amniocentesis, the risk of miscarriage from [[chorionic villus sampling]] (CVS) is believed to be approximately 1 in 100, although CVS may be done up to four weeks earlier, and may be preferable if the possibility of genetic defects is thought to be higher.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJM198903093201001 |title=The safety and efficacy of chorionic villus sampling for early prenatal diagnosis of cytogenetic abnormalities|year=1989|last1=Rhoads|first1=George G.|last2=Jackson|first2=Laird G.|last3=Schlesselman|first3=Sarah E.|last4=De La Cruz|first4=Felix F.|last5=Desnick|first5=Robert J.|last6=Golbus|first6=Mitchell S.|last7=Ledbetter|first7=David H.|last8=Lubs|first8=Herbert A.|last9=Mahoney|first9=Maurice J.|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=320|issue=10|pages=609–17|pmid=2645520}}</ref>

[[Amniotic fluid embolism]] has been described as a possible risk.<ref name="pmid3109636">{{cite journal |author=Dodgson J, Martin J, Boswell J, Goodall HB, Smith R |title=Probable amniotic fluid embolism precipitated by amniocentesis and treated by exchange transfusion |journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) |volume=294 |issue=6583 |pages=1322–3 |year=1987 |month=May |pmid=3109636 |pmc=1246486 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.294.6583.1322|url=}}</ref>

==Amniocentesis and stem cells==
Recent studies have discovered that amniotic fluid can be a rich source of multipotent [[mesenchymal stem cells|mesenchymal]], [[hematopoietic stem cell|hematopoietic]], [[neural stem cells|neural]], [[amniotic epithelial cells|epithelial]], and [[endothelial stem cell|endothelial]] [[stem cell]]s.<ref name="wash_post">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/07/AR2007010700674.html|title=Scientists See Potential In Amniotic Stem Cells | work=The Washington Post | first=Rick | last=Weiss | date=2007-01-08 | accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref><ref name="nature">{{cite journal |author=De Coppi P, Bartsch G, Siddiqui MM, ''et al.'' |title=Isolation of amniotic stem cell lines with potential for therapy |journal=Nat.

A potential benefit of using [[amniotic stem cells]] over those obtained from embryos is that they side-step [[stem cell controversy|ethical concerns]] among [[pro-life]] activists by obtaining pluripotent lines of undifferentiated cells without harm to a fetus or destruction of an embryo. These stem cells would also, if used to treat the same individual they came from, sidestep the donor/recipient issue which has so far stymied all attempts to use donor-derived stem cells in therapies. 

Artificial heart valves, working tracheas, as well as muscle, fat, bone, heart, neural and liver cells have all been engineered through use of [[amniotic stem cells]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}. Tissues obtained from amniotic cell lines show promise for patients suffering from congenital diseases/malformations of the heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, and cerebral tissue.<ref name="urlStem cells scientific updates - BiocellCenter">{{cite web |url=http://www.biocellcenter.com/en/services_research/scientific_updates/ |title=Stem cells scientific updates – BiocellCenter |accessdate=2010-01-11| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100111035235/http://www.biocellcenter.com/en/services_research/scientific_updates/| archivedate= 11 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
