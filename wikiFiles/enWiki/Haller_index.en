[[File:Haller index PE.jpg|thumb|A CT scan showing a 3.58 index]]
The '''Haller index''', created in 1987 by Dr. Haller, Dr. Kramer, and Dr. Lietman,<ref>Haller JA, Kramer SS, Lietman A. Use of CT scans in
selection of patients for pectus excavatum surgery: a
prelminary report. J Pediatr Surg 1987;22:904-6</ref> is a mathematical relationship that exists in a human [[chest]] section observed with a [[CT scan]]. It is defined as the [[ratio]] of the transverse diameter (the horizontal distance of the inside of the [[ribcage]]) and the anteroposterior diameter (the shortest distance between the [[vertebrae]] and [[Human sternum|sternum]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/jbpneu/v30n6/en_a03v30n6.pdf|title=How the Haller is measured. Departament of Cardiology and Pulmonology of the Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo – Thoracic Surgery Sector|format=PDF}}</ref> It is of diagnostic use ''[[in vivo]]''.

:<math>\ HI = \frac {distance1}{distance2}</math>

where:
: '''HI''' is the Haller Index
: ''distance1'' is the distance of the inside ribcage
: ''distance2'' is the distance between the sternum and vertebrae.

A normal Haller index should be about 2.5. Chest wall deformities such as [[pectus excavatum]] can cause the sternum to invert, thus increasing the index, which can reach 3.25 or even as high as 5.5<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FSL/is_6_74/ai_81218971|title=Haller ranges | work=AORN Journal | first=Barbara | last=Swoveland | year=2001}}</ref>
