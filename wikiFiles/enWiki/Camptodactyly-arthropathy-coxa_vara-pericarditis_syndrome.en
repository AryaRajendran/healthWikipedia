'''Camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome''' is a rare genetic condition due to a mutation in the gene proteoglycan 4 ([[PRG4]]) - a [[chondroitin sulfate]] [[proteoglycan]] that acts as a lubricant for the cartilage surfaces. This gene is also known as lubricin. 

This condition is inherited as an autosomal recessive.

==Genetics==

The gene responsible for this condition is located on the long arm of [[chromosome 1]] (1q). The encoded protein is a [[glycoprotein]] of ~345 kDa<ref>{{cite journal |author=Su JL, Schumacher BL, Lindley KM, ''et al.'' |title=Detection of superficial zone protein in human and animal body fluids by cross-species monoclonal antibodies specific to superficial zone protein |journal=Hybridoma |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=149–57 |year=2001 |month=June |pmid=11461663 |doi=10.1089/027245701750293475}}</ref>  specifically synthesized by [[chondrocyte]]s located at the surface of [[articular cartilage]], and also by some synovial lining cells. The cDNA encodes a protein of 1,404 amino acids (human A isoform) with a [[vitronectin|somatomedin B]] homology domain, [[heparin]]-binding domains, multiple [[mucin]]-like repeats, a [[hemopexin]] domain, and an aggregation domain. There are 3 consensus sequences for N-glycosylation and 1 chondroitin sulfate substitution site.

This condition was first described in 1986.<ref name=Bulutlar1986>Bulutlar G, Yazici H, Ozdogan H, Schreuder I (1986) A familial syndrome of pericarditis, arthritis, camptodactyly and coxa vara.

Children with this syndrome often present with a joint effusion that is cool and resistant to anti-inflammatory therapy. The arthropathy principally involves large joints such as elbows, hips, knees, and ankles. Pericarditis may be a presenting feature or may occur later in the course of the disease. Coxa vara occurs in 50–90% of cases and noninflammatory pericarditis in 30%.

===Laboratory===

The full blood count, [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] and [[C reactive protein]] are normal.

Synovial fluid is typically viscous, clear, honey-colored, and low in cell count. Synovial histology shows little or no mononuclear infiltration. Mild thickening of the [[synovium]] is present and giant cells may be occasionally seen.

===Radiology===

Large acetabular cysts are common in this condition.<ref name="Offiah2005"/> Other features include periarticular [[osteopenia]], squaring of [[metacarpal]]s and [[phalanges]] and bilateral joint effusions.
