==Early life==
Andrei Bloom was born on 19 June, 1914, in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], to Xenia and Boris Edvardovich Bloom. On his mother's side, he was the nephew of the composer [[Alexander Scriabin]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

He spent his early childhood in [[Russia]] and [[Iran]]. During the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] the family had to leave Iran, and by 1923 they were settled in [[Paris]], where he was educated. He graduated in physics, chemistry and biology, and took his doctorate in medicine at the [[University of Paris]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

By his own words, he met [[Christ]], when he was a teenager:
<blockquote>
"I met Christ as a Person at a moment when I needed him in order to live, and at a moment when I was not in search of him. I was found; I did not find him".

"I was a teenager then. Life had been difficult in the early years and now it had of a sudden become easier. All the years when life had been hard I had found it natural, if not easy, to fight; but when life became easy and happy I was faced quite unexpectedly with a problem: I could not accept aimless happiness. Hardships and suffering had to be overcome, there was something beyond them. Happiness seemed to be stale if it had no further meaning".

"As it often happens when you are young and when you act with passion, bent to possess either everything or nothing, I decided that I would give myself a year to see whether life had a meaning, and if I discovered it had none I would not live beyond the year..."--<ref>[http://www.metropolit-anthony.orc.ru/eng/index.htm Metropolitan Anthony]; O R C</ref>

</blockquote>

==Career==
In 1939, before leaving for the front as a surgeon in the [[France|French]] army, he secretly professed [[Monasticism|monastic]] vows in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. In 1943 he was [[tonsure]]d and received the name of Antony. During the occupation of France by [[Nazi Germany]] he worked as a doctor, and took part in the [[French Resistance]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

After the war he continued practising as a physician until 1948, when he was ordained to the presbyterate and sent to Britain to serve as Orthodox Christian [[Chaplain]] of the [[Fellowship of Saint Alban and Saint Sergius]], a society established to foster understanding and friendship between the Orthodox and Anglican communions. In 1950 he was appointed vicar of the [[Parish of the Dormition, London|Russian Patriarchal parish]] in London.

In 1957 he was consecrated as Bishop, and as archbishop in 1962 in charge of the [[Russian Orthodox Church in Great Britain and Ireland]].

In 1963 he was appointed [[Exarch]] of the Moscow Patriarchate in Western Europe, and in 1966 was assigned the rank of [[Metropolitan bishop]].

In 1974 by mutual agreement he was released from the function of Exarch, in order to devote himself more fully to the pastoral needs of the growing flock of his diocese. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Between 1966 and 1986 he brought out six books on prayer.

In the summer of 2003 Bloom resigned as diocesan bishop. He died on 4 August 2003. His grave in the [[Brompton Cemetery]], London, is visited by Christians and many others. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
