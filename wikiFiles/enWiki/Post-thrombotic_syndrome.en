'''Post-thrombotic syndrome''' ('''PTS''', also called '''post-phlebitic syndrome''' and '''venous stress disorder''') is the signs and symptoms that may occur as long-term complications of [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT).

==Incidence==
PTS can affect 23-60% of patients in the two years following DVT of the leg. Of those, 10% may go on to develop severe PTS, involving venous ulcers.<ref name="ashrani">Ashrani AA, Heit JA. Incidence and cost burden of post-thrombotic syndrome. J Thromb Thrombolysis 2009; 28: 465-76.</ref>

==Socioeconomic impact==
PTS lowers patients' quality of life after DVT, specifically with regards to physical and psychological symptoms and limitations in daily activities.<ref>Kahn SR, Hirsch A, Shrier I. Effect of postthrombotic syndrome on health-related quality of life after deep venous thrombosis. Arch Intern Med 2002;162:1144-8.</ref><ref>Kahn SR, M'Lan CE, Lamping DL, Kurz X, Berard A, Abenhaim L. The influence of venous thromboembolism on quality of life and severity of chronic venous disease.

Determinants of health-related quality of life during the 2 years following deep vein thrombosis. J Thromb Haemost. 2008;6:1105-12.</ref> Secondly, the treatment of PTS adds significantly to the cost of treating DVT. The annual health care cost of PTS in the United States has been estimated at $200 million, with costs over $3800 per patient in the first year alone, and increasing with disease severity.<ref name="ashrani"/><ref>Caprini JA, Botteman MF, Stephens JM, Nadipelli V, Ewing MM, Brandt S, et al.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms of PTS in the leg may include:<ref name="Kahn2009">{{cite journal|author=Kahn SR|title=How I treat postthrombotic syndrome|journal=Blood|volume=114|issue=21|year=2009|pages=4624–31|doi=10.1182/blood-2009-07-199174|pmid=19741190|url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/114/21/4624.long}}</ref>
*pain (aching or cramping)
*heaviness
*itching or tingling
*swelling (edema)
*varicose veins
*brownish or reddish skin discoloration
*ulcer

These signs and symptoms may vary among patients and over time. With PTS, these symptoms typically are worse after walking or standing for long periods of time and improve with resting or elevating the leg.<ref name="Kahn2009"/>

==Diagnosis==
When a physician finds a DVT in the past clinical history of their patient, a post-thrombotic syndrome will be possible if the patient has suggestive symptoms. A [[Lower limbs venous ultrasonography]] must be performed to evaluate the situation: the degree of obstruction by clots, the location of theses clots, the detection of deep and/or superficial venous insufficiency.<ref name="Masuda">{{cite journal|url=http://www.jvascsurg.org/article/S0741-5214(98)70201-0/fulltext|first=Masuda, E. M.|last=Sato, D. T.|journal=Journal of Vascular|volume=28|issue=1|month=7|year=1998|pp.=67-74}}</ref><ref>Kahn SR, Partsch H, Vedantham S, Prandoni P, Kearon C. Definition of post-thrombotic syndrome of the leg for use in clinical investigations: a recommendation for standardization. J Thromb Haemost 2009;7:879-83.</ref> Since signs and symptoms of DVT and PTS may be quite similar, a diagnosis of PTS should be delayed for 3–6 months after DVT diagnosis so that an appropriate diagnosis can be made.<ref name="Kahn2009"/>

==Cause==
Despite ongoing research, the cause of PTS is not entirely clear. Inflammation is thought to play a role <ref>Shbaklo H, Holcroft CA, Kahn SR. Levels of inflammatory markers and the development of the post-thrombotic syndrome. Thromb Haemost 2009; 101:505-12.</ref><ref>Roumen-Klappe EM, Janssen MC, Van Rossum J, Holewijn S, Van Bokhoven MM, Kaasjager K, et al. Inflammation in deep vein thrombosis and the development of post-thrombotic syndrome: a prospective study. J Thromb Haemost 2009;7:582-7.</ref> as well as damage to the venous valves from the thrombus itself. This valvular incompetence combined with persistent venous obstruction from thrombus increases the pressure in veins and capillaries. Venous hypertension induces a rupture of small superficial veins, subcutaneous hemorrhage<ref name="doj">Pirard D., Bellens B., Vereecken P. The post-thrombotic syndrome - a condition to prevent. ''Dermatology Online Journal'' 14 (3): 13</ref> and an increase of tissue permeability. That is manifested by pain, swelling, discoloration, and even ulceration.<ref>Vedantham S. Valvular dysfunction and venous obstruction in the post-thrombotic syndrome. Thromb Res 2009; 123 Suppl 4: S62-5.</ref>

===Risk factors===
The following factors increase the risk of developing PTS:<ref>Tick LW, Kramer MH, Rosendaal FR, Faber WR, Doggen CJ.

* age > 65
* proximal DVT
* a second DVT in same leg as first DVT (recurrent ipsilateral DVT)
* persistent DVT symptoms 1  month after DVT diagnosis
* obesity
* poor quality of anticoagulation control (i.e. dose too low) during the first 3 months of treatment

==Prevention==
Prevention of PTS begins with prevention of initial and recurrent DVT. For hospitalized patients at high-risk of DVT, prevention methods may include early ambulation, use of compression stockings or electrostimulation devices, and/or anticoagulant medications.<ref>Geerts WH, Bergqvist D, Pineo GF, Heit JA, Samama CM, Lassen MR, et al. Prevention of venous thromboembolism: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition). Chest 2008;133:381S-453S.</ref> For patients who have already had a single DVT event, the best way to prevent a second DVT is appropriate anticoagulation therapy.<ref name="kearon">Kearon C, Kahn SR, Agnelli G, Goldhaber S, Raskob GE, Comerota AJ. Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Chest 2008;133:454S-545S.</ref>

A second prevention approach may be weight loss for those who are overweight or obese. Increased weight can put more stress and pressure on leg veins, and can predispose patients to developing PTS.<ref name="ageno"/>

Finally, some data suggest that the use of elastic compression stockings for up to 2 years post-DVT can be an effective method of PTS prevention,<ref>Brandjes DP, Buller HR, Heijboer H, Huisman MV, de Rijk M, Jagt H, et al. Randomised trial of effect of compression stockings in patients with symptomatic proximal-vein thrombosis. Lancet 1997;349:759-62.</ref><ref>Prandoni P, Lensing AW, Prins MH, Frulla M, Marchiori A, Bernardi E, et al. Below-knee elastic compression stockings to prevent the post-thrombotic syndrome: a randomized, controlled trial. Ann Intern Med 2004;141:249-56.</ref> while some data suggest otherwise.<ref>Ginsberg JS, Hirsh J, Julian J, Vander LaandeVries M, Magier D, MacKinnon B, et al. Prevention and treatment of postphlebitic syndrome: results of a 3-part study. Arch Intern Med 2001;161:2105-9.</ref><ref>Aschwanden M, Jeanneret C, Koller MT, Thalhammer C, Bucher HC, Jaeger KA. Effect of prolonged treatment with compression stockings to prevent post-thrombotic sequelae: a randomized controlled trial. J Vasc Surg 2008;47:1015-21.</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment options for PTS include proper leg elevation, compression therapy with elastic stockings or electrostimulation devices, herbal remedies (such as horse chestnut, rutosides, pentoxifylline), and wound care for leg ulcers.<ref name="Kahn2009"/><ref>Vazquez SR, Freeman A, VanWoerkom RC, Rondina MT. Contemporary issues in the prevention and management of postthrombotic syndrome. Ann Pharmacother 2009; 43:1824-35.</ref> 

Compression bandages are useful to treat edemas.<ref name="doj" />

==Upper-extremities==
Patients with upper-extremity DVT may develop upper-extremity PTS, but the incidence is lower than that for lower-extremity PTS (15-25%).<ref>Elman EE, Kahn SR. The post-thrombotic syndrome after upper extremity deep venous thrombosis in adults: a systematic review. Thromb Res 2006;117:609-14.</ref><ref>Prandoni P, Bernardi E, Marchiori A, et al. The long-term clinical course of acute deep vein thrombosis of the arm: prospective cohort study. BMJ 2004; 329:484-5.</ref> There are no established treatment or prevention methods, but patients with upper-extremity PTS may wear a compression sleeve for persistent symptoms.<ref name="kearon"/>

==Research directions==
The field of PTS still holds many unanswered questions that are important targets for more research. Those include 
*fully defining the pathophysiology of PTS, including the role of inflammation and residual thrombus after completion of an appropriate duration of anticoagulant therapy
*developing a PTS risk prediction model
*role of thrombolysis ("clot-busting" drugs) in PTS prevention
*defining the true efficacy of elastic compression stockings for PTS prevention (and if effective, elucidating the minimum compression strength necessary and the optimal timing and duration of compression therapy)
*whether PTS prevention methods are necessary for patients with asymptomatic or distal DVT 
*additional treatment options for PTS with demonstrated safety and efficacy (compression and pharmacologic therapies){{citation needed|date=March 2012}}
