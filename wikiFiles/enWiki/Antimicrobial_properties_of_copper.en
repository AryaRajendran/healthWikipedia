[[Copper]] and its alloys ([[brass]]es, [[bronze]]s, [[cupronickel]], copper-nickel-zinc, and others) are natural [[antimicrobial]] materials. Ancient civilizations exploited the '''antimicrobial properties of copper''' long before the concept of microbes became understood in the nineteenth century.<ref>Dollwet, H.H.A. and Sorenson, J.R.J. Historic uses of copper compounds in medicine, ''Trace Elements in Medicine'', Vol. 2, No. 2, 1985, pp. 80–87.</ref><ref>[http://www.copper.org/publications/newsletters/innovations/2000/06/medicine-chest.html Medical Uses of Copper in Antiquity]</ref> In addition to several copper medicinal preparations, it was also observed centuries ago that water contained in copper vessels or transported in copper conveyance systems was of better quality (i.e., no or little visible [[Slime mold|slime]] formation) than water contained or transported in other materials.

The antimicrobial properties of copper are still under active investigation. Molecular mechanisms responsible for the antibacterial action of copper have been a subject of intensive research. Scientists are also actively demonstrating the intrinsic efficacies of copper alloy "touch surfaces" to destroy a wide range of [[microorganisms]] that threaten public health.

==Mechanisms of antibacterial action of copper==

In 1973, researchers at Battelle Columbus Laboratories<ref>Dick, R.J., Wray, J.A., and Johnston, H.N. (1973), A Literature and Technology Search on the Bacteriostatic and Sanitizing Properties of Copper and Copper Alloy Surfaces, Phase 1 Final Report, INCRA Project No. 212, June 29, 1973, contracted to Battelle Columbus Laboratories, Columbus, Ohio, US.</ref> conducted a comprehensive literature, technology and patent search that traced the history of understanding the “bacteriostatic and sanitizing properties of copper and copper alloy surfaces” which demonstrated that copper, in very small quantities, has the power to control a wide range of [[molds]], [[fungi]], [[algae]] and harmful [[microbes]]. Of the 312 citations mentioned in the review across the time period 1892–1973, the observations below are noteworthy:

A subsequent paper <ref name=thurman>{{cite journal | author = Thurman R.B., Gerba C.P. | year = 1989 | title = The Molecular Mechanisms of Copper and Silver Ion Disinfection of Bacteria and Viruses | url = | journal = CRC Critical Reviews in Environmental Control | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 295–315 }}</ref> probed some of copper’s antimicrobial mechanisms and cited no fewer than 120 investigations into the efficacy of copper’s action on microbes. The authors noted that the antimicrobial mechanisms are very complex and take place in many ways, both inside [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and in the interstitial spaces between cells. 

Examples of some of the molecular mechanisms noted by various researchers include the following:

*The 3-dimensional structure of [[proteins]] can be altered by copper, so that the proteins can no longer perform their normal functions. The result is inactivation of bacteria or viruses <ref name=thurman/>

*Faster corrosion correlates with faster inactivation of microorganisms. This may be due to increased availability of [[cupric]] ion, Cu2+, which is believed to be responsible for the antimicrobial action.<ref>Michels, H.T., Wilks, S.A., Noyce, J.O., Keevil, C.W. (2005), Copper Alloys for Human Infectious Disease Control, Presented at Materials Science and Technology Conference, September 25–28, 2005, Pittsburgh, PA; Copper for the 21st Century Symposium</ref>

*In inactivation experiments on the flu strain, H1N1, which is nearly identical to the H5N1 avian strain and the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) strain, researchers hypothesized that copper’s antimicrobial action probably attacks the overall structure of the virus and therefore has a broad-spectrum effect.<ref name=astm>Michels, H.T. (2006), Anti-Microbial Characteristics of Copper, ''ASTM Standardization News'', October, pp. 28–31</ref>

*Microbes require copper-containing [[enzyme]]s to drive certain vital [[chemical reactions]]. Excess copper, however, can affect [[protein]]s and enzymes in microbes, thereby inhibiting their activities. Researchers believe that excess copper has the potential to disrupt cell function both inside cells and in the interstitial spaces between cells, probably acting on the cells’ outer envelope.<ref>BioHealth Partnership Publication (2007): Lowering Infection Rates in Hospitals and Healthcare Facilities - The Role of Copper Alloys in Battling Infectious Organisms, Edition 1, March.</ref>

Currently, researchers believe that the most important antimicrobial mechanisms for copper are as follows:

*Elevated copper levels inside a cell causes oxidative stress and the generation of [[hydrogen peroxide]]. Under these conditions, copper participates in the so-called [[Fenton's reagent|Fenton-type reaction]] — a chemical reaction causing oxidative damage to cells.

*Excess copper causes a decline in the membrane integrity of microbes, leading to leakage of specific essential cell nutrients, such as [[potassium]] and [[glutamate]]. This leads to [[desiccation]] and subsequent cell death.

*While copper is needed for many protein functions, in an excess situation (as on a copper alloy surface), copper binds to proteins that do not require copper for their function. This “inappropriate” binding leads to loss-of-function of the protein, and/or breakdown of the protein into nonfunctional portions.

These potential mechanisms, as well as others, are the subject of continuing study by academic research laboratories around the world.

==Antimicrobial efficacy of copper alloy touch surfaces==
{{main|Antimicrobial copper touch surfaces}}
Copper alloy surfaces have intrinsic properties to destroy a wide range of [[microorganisms]]. In the interest of protecting public health, especially in heathcare environments with their susceptible patient populations, an abundance of peer-reviewed antimicrobial efficacy studies have been conducted in the past 10 years regarding copper’s efficacy to destroy ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' O157:H7, [[methicillin]]-resistant ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (MRSA), ''[[Staphylococcus]]'', ''[[Clostridium difficile]]'', [[influenza A virus]], [[Adenoviridae|adenovirus]], and [[Fungus|fungi]].<ref>[http://coppertouchsurfaces.org/antimicrobial/bacteria/index.html Copper Touch Surfaces]</ref> [[Stainless steel]] was also investigated since it is such an important surface material in today’s healthcare environments. The studies cited here, plus others directed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], resulted in the 2008 registration of 274 different copper alloys as certified antimicrobial materials that have public health benefits.

===''E. coli''===
{{main|Escherichia coli}}
''E. coli'' O157:H7 is a potent, highly infectious, ACDP (Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens, UK) Hazard Group 3 foodborne and waterborne [[pathogen]]. The bacterium produces potent [[toxin]]s that cause diarrhea, severe aches and nausea in infected persons. Symptoms of severe infections include hemolytic colitis (bloody diarrhea), hemolytic uremic syndrome (kidney disease), and death. ''E. coli'' O157:H7 has become a serious public health threat because of its increased incidence and because children up to 14 years of age, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals are at risk of incurring the most severe symptoms.

====Efficacy on copper surfaces====
Recent studies have shown that copper alloy surfaces kill ''E. coli'' O157:H7.<ref>Michels, H.T., Wilks, S.A., Noyce, J.O., Keevil, C.W., 2005, Copper Alloys for Human Infectious Disease Control, Presented at Materials Science and Technology Conference, September 25–28, 2005, Pittsburgh, PA; Copper for the 21st Century Symposium</ref><ref name=wilks>{{cite journal|pmid=16253366|year=2005|last1=Wilks|first1=SA|last2=Michels|first2=H|last3=Keevil|first3=CW|title=The survival of Escherichia coli O157 on a range of metal surfaces|volume=105|issue=3|pages=445–54|doi=10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2005.04.021|journal=International Journal of Food Microbiology}}</ref> Over 99.9% of ''E. coli'' microbes are killed after just 1–2 hours on copper. On stainless steel surfaces, the microbes can survive for weeks. 

Results of ''E. coli'' O157:H7 destruction on an alloy containing 99.9% copper (C11000) demonstrate that this pathogen is rapidly and almost completely killed (over 99.9% kill rate) within ninety minutes at room temperature (20 °C).<ref>Michels, H.T., Wilks, S.A., Noyce, J.O., Keevil, C.W., 2005, Copper Alloys for Human Infectious Disease Control, Presented at Materials Science and Technology Conference, September 25–28, 2005, Pittsburgh, PA; Copper for the 21st Century Symposium.</ref> At chill temperatures (4 °C), over 99.9% of E. coli O157:H7 are killed within 270 minutes. ''E. coli'' O157:H7 destruction on several copper alloys containing 99%–100% copper (including C10200, C11000, C18080, and C19700) at room temperature begins within minutes.<ref name=wilks/> At chilled temperatures, the inactivation process takes about an hour longer. No significant reduction in the amount of viable ''E. coli'' O157:H7 occurs on stainless steel after 270 minutes. 

Studies have been conducted to examine the ''E. coli'' O157:H7 bactericidal efficacies on 25 different copper alloys to identify those alloys that provide the best combination of antimicrobial activity, corrosion/oxidation resistance, and fabrication properties.<ref name=wilks/><ref name=c2>Michels, H.T., Wilks, S.A., and Keevil, C.W., 2004, “Effects of Copper Alloy Surfaces on the Viability of Bacterium, ''E. coli'' 0157:H7,” The Second Global Congress Dedicated to Hygienic Coatings & Surface Conference Papers, Orlando, Florida, US, 26–28 January 2004, Paper 16, Paint Research Association, Middlesex, UK</ref><ref name=c1>Michels, H.T., Wilks, S.A., and Keevil, C.W., (2003), The Antimicrobial Effects of Copper Alloy Surfaces on the Bacterium ''E. coli'' O157:H7, Proceedings of Copper 2003 - Cobre 2003, The 5th International Conference, Santiago, Chile, Vol. 1 - Plenary Lectures, Economics and Applications of Copper, pp. 439–450, The Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, (presented in Santiago, Chile, November 30–December 3, 2003)</ref> Copper’s antibacterial effect was found to be intrinsic in all of the copper alloys tested.

(2000), Long-Term Survival of Verocytotoxigenic ''Escherichia coli'' O157 on Stainless Steel Work Surfaces and Inhibition on Copper and Brass, ASM-P-119</ref> no antibacterial properties were observed on stainless steel (UNS S30400). Also, in confirmation with earlier studies <ref name=r2/><ref name=r3/> the rate of drop-off of ''E. coli'' O157:H7 on the copper alloys is faster at room temperature than at chill temperature. 

For the most part, the bacterial kill rate of copper alloys increased with increasing copper content of the alloy.<ref name=c2/><ref name=c1/> This is further evidence of copper’s intrinsic antibacterial properties.

====Efficacy on brass, bronze, copper-nickel alloys====
[[Brass]]es, which were frequently used for doorknobs and push plates in decades past, also demonstrate bactericidal efficacies, but within a somewhat longer time frame than pure copper.<ref name=wilks/> All nine brasses tested were almost completely bactericidal (over 99.9% kill rate) at 20 °C within 60–270 minutes. Many brasses were almost completely bactericidal at 4 °C within 180–360 minutes. 

The rate of total microbial death on four [[bronze]]s varied from within 50–270 minutes at 20 °C, and from 180 to 270 minutes at 4 °C. 

The kill rate of ''E. coli'' O157 on [[copper-nickel]] alloys increased with increasing copper content. Zero bacterial counts at room temperature were achieved after 105–360 minutes for five of the six alloys. Despite not achieving a complete kill, alloy C71500 achieved a 4-log drop within the six-hour test, representing a 99.99% reduction in the number of live organisms.

====Efficacy on stainless steel====
Unlike copper alloys, [[stainless steel]] (S30400) does not exhibit any degree of bactericidal properties.<ref name=wilks/> This material, which is one of the most common touch surface materials in the healthcare industry, allows toxic ''E. coli'' O157:H7 to remain viable for weeks. Near-zero bacterial counts are not observed even after 28 days of investigation. Epifluorescence photographs have demonstrated that ''E. coli'' O157:H7 is almost completely killed on copper alloy C10200 after just 90 minutes at 20 °C; whereas a substantial number of pathogens remain on stainless steel S30400.<ref name=astm/>

===MRSA===
{{main|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus}}
Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (MRSA) is a dangerous bacteria strain because it is resistant to [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0188-4409(03)00006-7|title=Occurrence of Resistance to Antibiotics, Metals, and Plasmids in Clinical Strains of Staphylococcus spp|year=2003|last1=Ug|first1=A|journal=Archives of Medical Research|volume=34|pages=130–6|pmid=12700009|last2=Ceylan|first2=O|issue=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0002-9343(93)90063-U|pmid=8452155|year=1993|last1=Mulligan|first1=ME|last2=Murray-Leisure|first2=KA|last3=Ribner|first3=BS|last4=Standiford|first4=HC|last5=John|first5=JF|last6=Korvick|first6=JA|last7=Kauffman|first7=CA|last8=Yu|first8=VL|title=Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: a consensus review of the microbiology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology with implications for prevention and management|volume=94|issue=3|pages=313–28|journal=The American Journal of Medicine}}</ref> Recent strains of the bacteria, EMRSA-15 and EMRSA-16, are highly transmissible and durable. This is of extreme importance to those concerned with reducing the incidence of hospital-acquired MRSA infections.

In 2008, after evaluating a wide body of research mandated specifically by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), registration approvals were granted by EPA in 2008 granting that copper alloys kill more than 99.9% of MRSA within two hours.

Subsequent research conducted at the University of Southampton (UK) compared the antimicrobial efficacies of copper and several non-copper proprietary coating products to kill MRSA.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.antimicrobialcopper.com/media/11996/effect_temp.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02637.x|title=Effects of temperature and humidity on the efficacy of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus challenged antimicrobial materials containing silver and copper|year=2009|last1=Michels|first1=H.T.|last2=Noyce|first2=J.O.|last3=Keevil|first3=C.W.|journal=Letters in Applied Microbiology|volume=49|pages=191–5|pmid=19413757|issue=2|pmc=2779462}}</ref><ref>Keevil, C.W., Noyce, J.O.

However, neither a triclosan-based product nor two silver-containing based antimicrobial treatments (Ag-A and Ag-B) exhibited any meaningful efficacy against MRSA. Stainless steel S30400 did not exhibit any antimicrobial efficacy.

In 2004, the University of Southampton research team was the first to clearly demonstrate that copper inhibits MRSA.<ref>Noyce, J.O. and Keevil, C.W. (2004), The Antimicrobial Effects of Copper and Copper-Based Alloys on Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'', Copper Development Association Poster Q-193 from Proceedings of the Annual General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology, 24–27 May 2004, New Orleans; presented at the American Society for Microbiology General Meeting, New Orleans, LA May 24th.</ref> On copper alloys — C19700 (99% copper), C24000 (80% copper), and C77000 (55% copper) — significant reductions in viability were achieved at room temperatures after 1.5 hours, 3.0 hours and 4.5 hours, respectively. Faster antimicrobial efficacies were associated with higher copper alloy content. Stainless steel did not exhibit any bactericidal benefits.

Stainless steel (S30400) was used as the experimental control. The copper alloys significantly reduced the viability of both ''C. difficile'' spores and vegetative cells. On C75200, near total kill was observed after one hour. On C11000, near total kill was observed after 3 hours. On C70600, near total kill was observed after 5 hours. On C26000, near total kill was achieved after 48 hours. On stainless steel, no reductions in viable organisms were observed after 72 hours (3 days) of exposure and no significant reduction was observed within 168 hours (1 week).

===Influenza A===
{{Main|Influenza A virus}}
[[Influenza]], commonly known as flu, is an infectious disease from a viral pathogen different from the one that produces the common cold. Symptoms of influenza, which are much more severe than the common cold, include fever, sore throat, muscle pains, severe headache, coughing, weakness and general discomfort. Influenza can cause [[pneumonia]], which can be fatal, particularly in young children and the elderly.

After incubation for one hour on copper, active influenza A virus particles were reduced by 75%.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17259354|year=2007|last1=Noyce|first1=JO|last2=Michels|first2=H|last3=Keevil|first3=CW|title=Inactivation of Influenza A Virus on Copper versus Stainless Steel Surfaces|volume=73|issue=8|pages=2748–50|doi=10.1128/AEM.01139-06|pmc=1855605|journal=Applied and environmental microbiology}}</ref><ref name=r1>[http://coppertouchsurfaces.org/antimicrobial/viruses.html Viruses Influenza A]</ref> After six hours, the particles were reduced on copper by 99.999%.

[[Adenoviridae|Adenovirus]] is a group of viruses that infect the tissue lining membranes of the respiratory and urinary tracts, eyes, and intestines. Adenoviruses account for about 10% of acute respiratory infections in children. These viruses are a frequent cause of diarrhea.

In a recent study, 75% of adenovirus particles were inactivated on copper (C11000) within 1 hour. Within six hours, 99.999% of the adenovirus particles were inactivated. Within six hours, 50% of the infectious adenovirus particles survived on stainless steel.<ref name=r1/>

The antifungal efficacy of copper was compared to [[aluminium]] on the following organisms that can cause human infections: ''[[Aspergillus]]'' spp., ''[[Fusarium]]'' spp., ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum]]'', ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' and ''[[Candida albicans]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://130.88.242.202/medicine/Aspergillus/articlesoverflow/copperAsp.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02753.x|title=Potential for preventing spread of fungi in air-conditioning systems constructed using copper instead of aluminium|year=2010|last1=Weaver|first1=L.|last2=Michels|first2=H.T.|last3=Keevil|first3=C.W.|journal=Letters in Applied Microbiology|volume=50|pages=18–23|pmid=19943884|issue=1}}</ref> An increased die-off of fungal spores was found on copper surfaces compared with aluminium. ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' growth occurred on the aluminium [[Coupon (materials science)|coupons]]; growth was inhibited on and around copper coupons.
