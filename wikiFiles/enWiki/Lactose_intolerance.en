'''Lactose intolerance''', also called '''lactase deficiency''' and '''hypolactasia''', is the inability to digest [[lactose]], a sugar found in [[milk]] and to a lesser extent milk-derived [[dairy products]]. It is not a disorder as such, but a genetically-determined characteristic.

Lactose intolerant individuals have insufficient levels of [[lactase]], an [[enzyme]] that catalyzes [[hydrolysis]] of lactose into [[glucose]] and [[galactose]], in their digestive system. In most cases this causes symptoms which may include abdominal bloating and cramps, flatulence, diarrhea, nausea, [[borborygmi]] (rumbling stomach), or vomiting<ref name=NDDIC>{{cite web | title=Lactose Intolerance | url=http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/lactoseintolerance/ | work=National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse (NDDIC) | publisher=NIDDK | accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref> after consuming significant amounts of lactose.

Most [[mammal]]s normally cease to produce lactase, becoming lactose intolerant, after [[weaning]], but some human populations have developed [[lactase persistence]], in which lactase production continues into adulthood. It is estimated that 75% of adults worldwide show some decrease in lactase activity during adulthood.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-27939567_ITM |title=Improved lactose digestion and intolerance among African-American adolescent girls fed a dairy-rich diet | last = | first = | journal =Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 100| issue = 5| year=2000 |accessdate=2009-02-03 |quote=Approximately 75% of the world's population loses the ability to completely digest a physiological dose of lactose after infancy |work= | pmid=10812376 |last1=Pribila |first1=BA |last2=Hertzler |first2=SR |last3=Martin |first3=BR |last4=Weaver |first4=CM |last5=Savaiano |first5=DA |pages=524–8; quiz 529–30 |doi=10.1016/S0002-8223(00)00162-0}}</ref> The frequency of decreased lactase activity ranges from 5% in northern Europe through 71% for Sicily to more than 90% in some African and Asian countries.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite journal |last1=Bulhões |first1=A.C. |last2=Goldani |first2=H.A.S. |last3=Oliveira |first3=F.S. |last4=Matte |first4=U.S. |last5=Mazzuca |first5=R.B. |last6=Silveira |first6=T.R. |title=Correlation between lactose absorption and the C/T-13910 and G/A-22018 mutations of the lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LCT) gene in adult-type hypolactasia |journal=Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research |volume=40 |issue=11 |pages=1441–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17934640 |doi=10.1590/S0100-879X2007001100004}}</ref> This distribution is now thought to have been caused by recent [[natural selection]] favoring lactase-persistent individuals in cultures in which dairy products are available as a food source.<ref>Beja-Pereira A et al.

== Terminology ==
"Lactose intolerance" primarily refers to a [[syndrome]] having one or more symptoms upon the consumption of food substances containing lactose. Individuals may be lactose intolerant to varying degrees, depending on the severity of these symptoms. "Lactose malabsorption" refers to the physiological concomitant of lactase deficiency (i.e., the body does not have sufficient lactase capacity to digest the amount of lactose ingested).<ref name="Heyman 2006">{{Cite doi|10.1542/peds.2006-1721}}</ref>  A medical condition with similar symptoms is [[fructose malabsorption]].

Lactase deficiency has a number of causes and is classified as one of three types:
* '''Primary lactase deficiency''' is genetic, only affects adults and is caused by the absence of a [[lactase persistence]] allele.<ref name="Heyman 2006" /><ref name=variant>{{cite journal |author=Enattah NS, Sahi T, Savilahti E, Terwilliger JD, Peltonen L, Järvelä I |title=Identification of a variant associated with adult-type hypolactasia |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=233–7 |year=2002 |pmid=11788828 |doi=10.1038/ng826}}</ref> It is the most common cause of lactose intolerance as a majority of the world's population lacks these alleles.<ref name="Swallow 2003">{{Cite doi|10.1146/annurev.genet.37.110801.143820}}</ref>
* '''Secondary, acquired, or transient lactase deficiency''' is caused by an injury to the [[small intestine]], usually during infancy, from acute [[gastroenteritis]], [[diarrhea]], [[chemotherapy]], [[intestinal parasites]] or other environmental causes.<ref name="Heyman 2006" /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Swagerty DL, Walling AD, Klein RM |title=Lactose intolerance |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=65 |issue=9 |pages=1845–50 |year=2002 |pmid=12018807 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20020501/1845.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lawson|first=Margaret|last2=Bentley|first2=Donald|last3=Lifschitz|first3=Carlos|title=Pediatric gastroenterology and clinical nutrition|year=2002|publisher=Remedica|location=London|isbn=978-1-901346-43-5|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dLLgzcMsbo0C&pg=PA109&lpg=PA109lse#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=109}}</ref><ref name="eMedicine pediatric">{{Emedicine|emerg|930971|Pediatric Lactose Intolerance}}</ref>
* '''Congenital lactase deficiency''' is a very rare, [[autosomal recessive]] genetic disorder that prevents lactase expression from birth.<ref name="Heyman 2006" /> It is particularly common in [[Finland]].<ref name="Behrendt 2009">Behrendt, M; Kelser, M; Hoch, M;  Naim, H.Y. “Impaired trafficking and Subcellular Localization of a Mutant Lactase associated with congenital Lactase Deficiency”. Gastroenterology.2009.  Vol.136(7). P2295-2303.</ref> People with congenital lactase deficiency are unable to digest lactose from birth, and they are unable to digest breast milk.

Lactose intolerance is not an [[Food allergy|allergy]] because it is not an [[Immune system|immune response]], but rather a problem with digestion caused by lactase deficiency. [[Milk allergy]] is a separate condition, with distinct symptoms that occur when the presence of milk proteins trigger an immune reaction.

==Symptoms==
The principal symptom of lactose intolerance is an adverse reaction to products containing lactose (primarily milk), including abdominal [[bloating]] and [[cramps]], [[flatulence]], [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]], [[borborygmi]] (rumbling stomach) and [[vomiting]] (particularly in [[adolescents]]). These appear thirty minutes to two hours after consumption.<ref name=NDDIC /> The severity of symptoms typically increases with the amount of lactose consumed; most lactose-intolerant people can tolerate a certain level of lactose in their diet without ill-effect.<ref name="Savaiano and Levitt 1987" /><ref name="Madry et al 2011">{{cite doi|10.5114/pg.2011.25381}}</ref>

=== Nutritional implications of CLD===
Congenital lactase deficiency (CLD), where the production of lactase is inhibited from birth, can be dangerous in any society because of infants' initial reliance on [[human breast milk]] for nutrition until they are weaned onto other foods. Before the 20th century, babies born with CLD often did not survive,<ref name="Heyman 2006" /> but death rates decreased with [[soybean]]-derived [[infant formula]]s and manufactured lactose-free dairy products.<ref>name="Sinden, A.A 1991 Emedicine|PED|1270|Lactose Intolerance" Guandalini S, Frye R, Rivera-Hernández D, Miller L, Borowitz S</ref> Beyond infancy, individuals affected by CLD usually have the same nutritional concerns as any lactose-intolerant adult.

==Causes==
Lactose intolerance is a consequence of lactase deficiency, which may be genetic or environmentally induced. In either case, symptoms are caused by insufficient levels of the [[enzyme]] lactase in the lining of the [[duodenum]]. Lactose, a [[disaccharide]] molecule found in milk and dairy products, cannot be directly absorbed through the wall of the small intestine into the bloodstream so, in the absence of lactase, passes intact into the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]. [[Gut flora|Bacteria]] in the colon are able to metabolise lactose, and the resulting [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] produces copious amounts of gas (a mixture of [[hydrogen]], [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]]) that causes the various abdominal symptoms. The unabsorbed sugars and fermentation products also raise the [[osmotic pressure]] of the colon, resulting in an increased flow of water into the bowels ([[diarrhea]]).<ref name="eMedicine overview">{{EMedicine|article|187249|Lactose intolerance|overview}}</ref> Certain mutation in the LCT gene allow lactase continue to be expressed after stopping breast feeding. The LCT gene which encodes the lactase protein is located on the long arm (q) of chromosome 2 in region 21. The locus can be expressed as 2q21.

== Diagnosis ==
To assess lactose intolerance, intestinal function is challenged by ingesting more dairy products than can be readily digested.  Clinical symptoms typically appear within 30 minutes, but may take up to two hours, depending on other foods and activities.<ref>{{cite web |author=R. Bowen |title=Lactose Intolerance (Lactase Non-Persistence) |url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/smallgut/lactose_intol.html |date=December 28, 2006 |publisher=Colorado State University |work=Pathophysiology of the Digestive System}}</ref>  Substantial variability in response (symptoms of nausea, cramping, bloating, diarrhea, and flatulence) is to be expected, as the extent and severity of lactose intolerance varies among individuals.

Lactose intolerance is distinct from [[milk allergy]], an abnormal [[immune response]], (usually) to milk proteins. They may be distinguished in diagnosis by giving lactose-free milk, producing no symptoms in the case of lactose intolerance, but the same reaction as to normal milk in the presence of a milk allergy. An intermediate result might suggest that the person has both conditions. However, since lactose intolerance is common (some degree of it being found in most adults worldwide), it is not considered a disease and a medical diagnosis is not normally required. If positive confirmation is necessary, four tests are available.<ref>Olivier CE, Lorena SLS, Pavan CR, Santos RAPG, Lima RPS, Pinto DG, Silva MD, Zollner RL: Is it just lactose intolerance? Allergy and Asthma Proceedings 2012, 33(5):432-436.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23026186 PubMed]</ref>

=== Hydrogen breath test ===
In a [[hydrogen breath test]], after an overnight fast, 25 [[gram]]s of lactose (in a solution with water) is swallowed. If the lactose cannot be digested, enteric bacteria metabolize it and produce [[hydrogen]], which, along with [[methane]], if produced, can be detected on the patient's breath by a clinical gas chromatograph or compact solid-state detector. The test takes about 2 to 3 hours to complete.

=== Blood test ===
In conjunction, measuring blood glucose level every 10 to 15 minutes after ingestion will show a "flat curve" in individuals with lactose malabsorption, while the lactase persistent will have a significant "top", with a typical  elevation of 50% to 100%, within one to two hours. However, due to the need for frequent blood sampling, this approach has been largely replaced by breath testing.

'''Lactose tolerance test''':
In a lactose tolerance test, you will be given a drink of lactose solution, and then a sample of blood will be taken from your arm using a needle. The blood will be tested to see how much glucose (blood sugar) it contains.

If you are lactose intolerant, your blood sugar levels will either rise slowly, or not at all. This is because your body is unable to break down the lactose into glucose.

'''Milk tolerance test''':
In a milk tolerance test, you will be given a glass of milk (about 500ml) and your blood sugar levels will be tested. If your blood sugar levels do not rise after drinking the milk, you may be lactose intolerant.

After an overnight fast, blood is drawn and then 50 [[gram]]s of lactose (in aqueous solution) is swallowed. Blood is then drawn again at the 30 minute, 1-hour, 2-hour, and 3-hour mark.  If the lactose cannot be digested, blood glucose levels will rise by less than 20&nbsp;mg/dL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003500.htm|date=3-May-2011|title=Lactose tolerance tests}}</ref>

=== Stool acidity test ===
This test can be used to diagnose lactose intolerance in infants, for whom other forms of testing are risky or impractical.<ref>{{cite web |author=National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse | title=Lactose Intolerance&nbsp;— How is lactose intolerance diagnosed? | url=http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/lactoseintolerance/#diagnosed |month=March | year=2006 |publisher= National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health}}</ref> The infant is given lactose to drink. If the individual is tolerant, the lactose is digested and absorbed in the small intestine; otherwise it is not digested and absorbed and it reaches the colon. The bacteria in the colon, mixed with the lactose, cause acidity in stools. Stools passed after the ingestion of the lactose are tested for level of acidity. If the stools are acidic, the infant is intolerant to lactose.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stool Acidity Test|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/stool_acidity_test/article.htm#stool|publisher=Jay W. Marks, M.D.|accessdate=2011-05-20}}</ref>
Stool pH in lactose intolerance is less than 5.5.

=== Intestinal biopsy ===
An intestinal biopsy can confirm lactase deficiency following discovery of elevated hydrogen in the hydrogen breath test.<ref name="Berdanier">{{cite book |author=Hargrove, James L.; Berdanier, Carolyn D. |title=Nutrition and gene expression |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-8493-6961-4 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>  Modern techniques have enabled a test to be performed at the patient's bedside, identifying the presence/absence of the lactase enzyme in conjunction with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.<ref>Kuokkanen et al.  (2006).  A biopsy-based quick test in the diagnosis of duodenal hypolactasia in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.  Endoscopy; 38 (7): 708-712.</ref>  However, for research applications such as [[mRNA]] measurements, a specialist laboratory is required.

=== Stool sugar chromatography ===
It is a confirmatory test for lactose intolerance.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== Genetic diagnostic ===
It is used in primary lactose intolerance. lactase activity persistance in adults is associated with two [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s: C/T 13910 and G/A 22018 located in MCM6 gene.<ref>Enattah, N. et al. Identification of a variant associated with adult-type hypolactasia, 2002. Nature Genetics 30:233-237</ref> These polymorphisms may be detected by [[molecular biology]] techniques at the [[DNA]] extracted from blood or saliva samples; genetic kits specific for this diagnosis are available. The procedure consists of extracting and amplifying DNA from the sample, following with a hybridation protocol in a strip. Colored bands are obtained as final result, and depending on the different combination, it would be possible to determine whether the patient is lactose intolerant. This test allows a non-invasive definitive diagnostic.

== Management ==
Lactose intolerance is not considered a condition that requires treatment in societies where the diet contains relatively little dairy produce. However, those living among societies that are largely lactose-tolerant may find lactose intolerance troublesome. Although there was no way to reinstate lactase production {{As of|2013|lc=on}}, some individuals have reported that their intolerance varies over time, depending on health status and pregnancy<ref>{{Emedicine|med|3429|Lactose Intolerance}} Roy, Barakat, Nwakakwa, Shojamanesh, Khurana, July 5, 2006</ref> About 44% of lactose-intolerant women regain the ability to digest lactose during pregnancy. This might be caused by slow intestinal transit and intestinal flora changes during pregnancy{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}.

Lactose intolerance is not usually an absolute condition: The reduction in lactase production, and the amount of lactose that can therefore be tolerated, varies from person to person. Since lactose intolerance poses no further threat to a person's health, the condition is managed by minimizing the occurrence and severity of symptoms. Berdanier and Hargrove recognise four general principles in dealing with lactose intolerance—avoidance of dietary lactose, substitution to maintain nutrient intake, regulation of calcium intake and use of enzyme substitute.<ref name="Berdanier"/>

=== Avoiding lactose-containing products ===
Since each individual's tolerance to lactose varies, according to the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), "Dietary control of lactose intolerance depends on people learning through trial and error how much lactose they can handle."<ref name=NDDIC>{{cite web |author=National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse |title=Lactose Intolerance |url=http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/lactoseintolerance/ |month=March | year=2006 |publisher=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health}}</ref> Label reading is essential, as commercial terminology varies according to language and region.<ref name="Berdanier"/>

Lactose is present in two large food categories—conventional dairy products, and as a food additive in dairy and non-dairy products.

==== Dairy products ====
Lactose is a water-soluble substance. Fat content and the [[curd]]ling process affect tolerance of foods. After the curdling process, lactose is found in the water-based portion (along with [[whey]] and [[casein]]), but not in the fat-based portion. Dairy products that are "reduced-fat" or "fat-free" generally have slightly higher lactose content. [[Diet food|Low-fat]] dairy foods also often have various dairy derivatives, such as [[milk solids]],  added, increasing the lactose content.

;Milk
Human milk has a high lactose content, around 9%. Unprocessed cow milk is about 4.7% lactose. Unprocessed milk from other [[bovid]]s contains a similar fraction of lactose ([[goat milk]] 4.7%,<ref>[http://www.goatworld.com/articles/goatmilk/colostrum.shtml Composition of Human, Cow, and Goat Milks — Goat Milk — goatworld.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Bovinae|buffalo]] 4.86%,<ref name="Peeva">{{cite journal |author=Peeva |title=Composition of buffalo milk. Sources of specific effects on the separate components |year=2001 |journal=Bulg. J. Agric. Sci. |volume=7 |pages=329–35 |url=http://bjas.hit.bg/07/693A.htm}}</ref> [[yak]] 4.93%,<ref>[http://jag.igr.poznan.pl/2004-Volume-45/2/pdf/2004_Volume_45_2-215-224.pdf C:\JAG2\Jiang.vp<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[sheep milk|sheep]] 4.6%)

;Butter
The [[butter]]-making process separates the majority of milk's water components from the fat components. Lactose, being a water soluble molecule, will largely be removed, but will still be present in small quantities in the butter unless it is also fermented to produce cultured butter. [[Clarified butter]], however, contains very little lactose and is safe for most lactose-intolerant people.

;Yogurt, frozen yogurt and [[kefir]]
People can be more tolerant of traditionally made [[yogurt]] than milk, because it contains lactase produced by the bacterial cultures used to make the yogurt. Frozen yogurt, if cultured similarly to its unfrozen counterpart, will contain similarly reduced lactose levels. However, many commercial brands contain milk solids,{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} increasing the lactose content.

;Cheeses
Traditionally made hard [[cheese]]s, and soft ripened cheeses may create less reaction than the equivalent amount of milk because of the processes involved.  Fermentation and higher fat content contribute to lesser amounts of lactose. Traditionally made [[Emmental cheese|Emmental]] or [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]] might contain 10% of the lactose found in whole milk. In addition, the aging methods of traditional cheeses (sometimes over two years) reduce their lactose content to practically nothing.<ref>http://www.ilovecheese.com/lactose_intolerant_faqs.asp</ref> Commercial cheeses, however, are often manufactured by processes that do not have the same lactose-reducing properties. Ageing of some cheeses is governed by regulations;<ref>[http://www.farmhousecheesemakers.com/pdo-our-provenance/ Example of cheese regulations: "West Country Farmhouse Cheddar" must be aged for 9 months]</ref> in other cases there is no quantitative indication of degree of ageing and concomitant lactose reduction, and lactose content is not usually indicated on labels.

;Sour cream
If made in the traditional way, this may be tolerable, but most modern brands add milk solids.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reger, Combs, Coulter and Koch |title=A Comparison of Dry Sweet Cream Buttermilk and Non-Fat Dry Milk Solids in Breadmaking |url=http://jds.fass.org/cgi/content/abstract/34/2/136 |journal=Journal of Dairy Science |volume=34 |issue= 2 |pages=136–44 |date= February 1, 1951 |doi=10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(51)91682-7 }}</ref>

;Examples of lactose levels in foods
As industry standardization has not been established concerning lactose content analysis methods (non-hydrated form or the mono-hydrated form),<ref>[http://drinc.ucdavis.edu/goat1.htm Goat Milk Composition]</ref> and considering that dairy content varies greatly according to labeling practices, geography and manufacturing processes, lactose numbers may not be very reliable. The following table contains a guide to the typical lactose levels found in various foods.<ref>http://www.gastro.net.au/diets/lactose.html</ref>

==== Lactose in non-dairy products ====
Lactose (also present when labels state [[lactoserum]], [[whey]], [[milk solids]], [[modified milk ingredients]], etc.) is a commercial [[food additive]] used for its texture, flavour and adhesive qualities, and is found in foods such as processed meats<ref name="OHSU">{{cite web |title=General guidelines for milk allergy |url=http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/health/health-information/topic-by-id.cfm?ContentTypeId=90&ContentId=P01696 |publisher=Oregon Health & Science University}}</ref> ([[sausage]]s/[[hot dog]]s, sliced meats, [[pâté]]s), gravy stock powder, [[margarine]]s,<ref>{{cite web |title=Margarine Regulations |url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/JUST/REGULATIONS/regs/marge.htm}}</ref> sliced [[bread]]s,<ref>{{cite web |title=Enriched White Bread in Canada |url=http://www.celiac.ca/Articles/PAB%20Enriching%20GF%20Foods.html |publisher=The Canadian Celiac Association}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Influence of Nonfat Dry Milk Solids on the Nutritive Value of Bread |url=http://jds.fass.org/cgi/content/abstract/29/12/821 |journal=Journal of Dairy Science  |date= |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=821–9 |author=Riggs, Lloyd K; Beaty, Annabel; Johnson, Arnold H |month=December |doi=10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(46)92546-5 }}</ref> breakfast cereals, [[potato chip]]s,<ref name="Bartek">{{cite web |title=Bartek, food additive company |url=http://www.bartek.ca/pdfs/Applications/SavouryProducts/SavourySnackFoods/Savoury%20Snack%20Foods%20Alphabetical%20List%20of%20Product%20Names.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> [[Food processing|processed foods]], [[medication]]s, pre-prepared meals, meal replacement (powders and bars), protein supplements (powders and bars) and even [[beer]]s in the [[milk stout]] style. Some barbecue sauces and liquid cheeses used in fast-food restaurants may also contain lactose.

[[Kosher]] products labeled ''[[pareve]]'' or ''[[fleishig]]'' are free of milk. However, if a "D" (for "Dairy") is present next to the circled "K", "U", or other [[hechsher]], the food product likely contains milk solids,<ref name="OHSU"/> although it may also simply indicate that the product was produced on equipment shared with other products containing milk derivatives.

==== Alternative products ====
[[Plant milk|Plant-based "milks"]] and derivatives such as [[soy milk]], [[rice milk]], [[almond milk]], [[coconut milk]], [[hazelnut milk]], [[oat milk]], [[hemp milk]], and [[peanut milk]] are inherently lactose-free.

{{main|Milk#Reduction_or_elimination_of_lactose}}
Low-lactose and lactose-free versions of foods are often available to replace dairy-based foods for those with lactose intolerance.

=== Lactase supplementation ===
When lactose avoidance is not possible, or on occasions when a person chooses to consume such items, then enzymatic lactase supplements may be used.<ref name="Montalto">{{cite journal |author=Montalto M, Curigliano V, Santoro L, ''et al.'' |title=Management and treatment of lactose malabsorption |journal=World J. Gastroenterol. |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=187–91 |year=2006 |pmid=16482616 |doi= |url=http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/12/187.asp}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=He M, Yang Y, Bian L, Cui H |title=[Effect of exogenous lactase on the absorption of lactose and its intolerance symptoms] |language=Chinese |journal=Wei Sheng Yan Jiu |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=309–11 |year=1999 |pmid=12712706 |doi=}}</ref>

Lactase enzymes similar to those produced in the small intestines of humans are produced industrially by [[fungi]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Aspergillus]]''. The enzyme, [[Beta-galactosidase|β-galactosidase]], is available in tablet form in a variety of doses, in many countries without a prescription. It functions well only in high-acid environments, such as that found in the human gut due to the addition of gastric juices from the stomach. Unfortunately, too much acid can denature it,<ref>{{cite journal |author=O'Connell S, Walsh G |title=Physicochemical characteristics of commercial lactases relevant to their application in the alleviation of lactose intolerance |journal=Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. |volume=134 |issue=2 |pages=179–91 |year=2006 |pmid=16943638| doi = 10.1385/ABAB:134:2:179}}</ref> and it therefore should not be taken on an empty stomach. Also, the enzyme is ineffective if it does not reach the small intestine by the time the problematic food does. Lactose-sensitive individuals can experiment with both timing and dosage to fit their particular needs.

While essentially the same process as normal intestinal lactose digestion, direct treatment of milk employs a different variety of industrially produced lactase. This enzyme, produced by [[yeast]] from the genus ''[[Kluyveromyces]]'', takes much longer to act, must be thoroughly mixed throughout the product, and is destroyed by even mildly acidic environments. Its main use is in producing the lactose-free or lactose-reduced dairy products sold in supermarkets.

Enzymatic lactase supplementation may have an advantage over avoiding dairy products, in that alternative provision does not need to be made to provide sufficient calcium intake, especially in children.<ref name="heyman">{{cite journal |author=Heyman MB |title=Lactose intolerance in infants, children, and adolescents |journal=Pediatrics |volume=118 |issue=3 |pages=1279–86 |year=2006 |pmid=16951027 |doi=10.1542/peds.2006-1721 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/118/3/1279 |first2=Nutrition |last2=Committee On}}</ref>

=== Rehabituation to dairy products ===
For healthy individuals with secondary lactose intolerance, it may be possible in some cases for the bacteria in the large intestine to adapt to an altered diet and break down small quantities of lactose more effectively<ref>[http://www.agriculture.purdue.edu/agricultures/past/Spring1998/1998-Spring-Spotlights.pdf Lactose intolerant? Drink more milk] Steve Tally</ref> by habitually consuming small amounts of dairy products several times a day over a period of time. This is not suitable for people who have an underlying or chronic illness which may have damaged the [[intestinal tract]] in a way which prevents the lactase enzyme from being expressed.

Some studies indicate that environmental factors—more specifically, the consumption of lactose—may "play a more important role than genetic factors in the etio-pathogenesis of milk intolerance",<ref name="Yoshida">{{cite journal |author=Yoshida Y, Sasaki G, Goto S, Yanagiya S, Takashina K |title=Studies on the etiology of milk intolerance in Japanese adults |journal=Gastroenterol. Jpn. |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=29–34 |year=1975 |pmid=1234085 |doi=}}</ref> but some other publications suggest that lactase production does not seem to be induced by dairy/lactose consumption.<ref>[http://www.foodreactions.org/intolerance/lactose/prevalence.html Prevalence, Age & Genetics of Lactose Intolerance]&nbsp;— foodreactions.org</ref>{{Unreliable medical source|date=February 2012}}

==Lactase persistence==
{{main|Lactase persistence}}
Lactase persistence is the [[phenotype]] associated with various [[autosomal dominant]] alleles prolonging the activity of lactase beyond infancy; conversely, lactase non-persistence is the phenotype associated with primary lactase deficiency (see above). Among mammals, lactase persistence is unique to humans&nbsp;— it evolved relatively recently (in the last 10,000 years) among some populations, and the majority of people worldwide remain lactase non-persistent.<ref name="Swallow 2003" /> For this reason lactase persistence is of some interest to the fields of [[anthropology]] and [[human genetics]], which typically use the genetically derived persistence/non-persistence terminology.

Genetic analysis shows that lactase persistence has developed multiple times in different places independently in an example of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tishkoff|first=Sarah A|coauthors=Floyd A Reed, Alessia Ranciaro, Benjamin F Voight, Courtney C Babbitt, Jesse S Silverman, Kweli Powell, Holly M Mortensen, Jibril B Hirbo, Maha Osman, Muntaser Ibrahim, Sabah A Omar, Godfrey Lema, Thomas B Nyambo, Jilur Ghori, Suzannah Bumpstead, Jonathan K Pritchard, Gregory A Wray & Panos Deloukas|title=Convergent adaptation of human lactase persistence in Africa and Europe|journal=Nature Genetics|date=10 December 2006|year=2006|volume=39|pages=31-40|doi=10.1038/ng1946|url=http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v39/n1/full/ng1946.html|accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref>

Recognition of the extent and genetic basis of lactose intolerance is relatively recent. Though its symptoms were described as early as [[Hippocrates]] (460-370 B.C.),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wilson J |title=Milk Intolerance: Lactose Intolerance and Cow's Milk Protein Allergy |journal=Newborn and Infant Nursing Reviews |month=December | year=2005 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=203–7 |doi=10.1053/j.nainr.2005.08.004}}</ref> until the 1960s the prevailing assumption in the medical community was that tolerance was the norm and intolerance either the result of [[milk allergy]], an intestinal [[pathogen]], or else was [[psychosomatic]] (it being recognised that some cultures did not practice dairying, and people from those cultures often reacted badly to consuming milk).<ref>Auricchio, S., Rubino, A., Landolt, M., Semenza, G. and Prader, A. 1963. Isolated intestinal lactase deficiency in the adult. ''Lancet'' 280(7303): 324–326.</ref><ref name="Simoons 1969">Simoons, F. J. 1969. Primary adult lactose intolerance and the milking habit: A problem in biological and cultural interrelations. I. Review of the medical research. ''Digestive Diseases and Sciences'' 14(12): 819–836.</ref> There were two reasons for this perception. Firstly, many Western countries have a predominantly European heritage, and so have low frequencies of lactose intolerance,<ref name="Itan et al. 2010">{{Cite doi|10.1186/1471-2148-10-36}}</ref> and have an extensive cultural history of dairying. Therefore, tolerance actually was the norm in most of the societies investigated by medical researchers at that point. Secondly, within even these societies lactose intolerance tends to be under-reported: genetically lactase non-persistent individuals can tolerate varying quantities of lactose before showing symptoms, and their symptoms differ in severity. Most are able to digest a small quantity of milk, for example in tea or coffee, without suffering any adverse effects.<ref name="Savaiano and Levitt 1987">Savaiano, D. A. and Levitt, M. D. 1987. Milk intolerance and microbe-containing dairy foods. Journal of Dairy Science 70(2): 397–406.</ref> [[Fermented milk products|Fermented dairy products]], such as cheese, also contain dramatically less lactose than plain milk. Therefore, in societies where tolerance is the norm, many people who consume only small amounts of dairy or have only mild symptoms, may be unaware that they cannot digest lactose. Eventually, however, it was recognised that in the [[United States]] lactose intolerance is correlated with [[race (classification of humans)|race]].<ref>Bayless, T. M. and Rosensweig, N. S. 1966.
