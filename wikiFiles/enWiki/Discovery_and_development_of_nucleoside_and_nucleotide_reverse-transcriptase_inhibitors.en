Discovery and development of [[nucleoside]] and [[nucleotide]] [[reverse-transcriptase inhibitors]] (NRTIs and NtRTIs) began in the 1980s when the [[AIDS]] [[epidemic]] hit Western societies. NRTIs inhibit the [[reverse transcriptase]] (RT), an [[enzyme]] that controls the replication of the genetic material of the human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]). The first NRTI was [[zidovudine]], approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1987, which was the first step towards treatment of HIV. Six NRTI agents and one NtRTI have followed. The NRTIs and the NtRTI are analogues of endogenous 2´-deoxy-nucleoside and nucleotide. [[Drug resistance|Drug-resistant]] [[virus]]es are an inevitable consequence of prolonged exposure of HIV-1 to anti-HIV drugs.

Most standard HIV drug thearapies revolve around inhibiting the reverse transcriptase enzyme (RT), an enzyme that is necessary to the HIV-1 virus and other [[retroviruses]] to complete their life cycle.<ref name="Boyer _2008"/> The RT enzyme serves two key functions. First, it controls the replication of the viruses genetic material via its [[polymerase]] activity. It converts the viral single-stranded [[RNA]] into an integration competent double stranded [[DNA]]. Subsequently the generated DNA is translocated into the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] of the host [[cell (biology)|cell]] where it is integrated in its [[genome]] by the retroviral integrase. The other role of the RT is its [[ribonuclease H]] activity that degrades RNA only when it is in a [[heteroduplex]] with DNA.<ref name=Herschorn_2008>{{Citation | last1 =  Herschorn|  last2 =Hizi| first1 = A.| title =

=== Structure ===
HIV-1 RT is an asymmetric{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}} heterodimer which is 1000 [[amino acid]] long and is composed of two [[Protein subunit|subunit]]s. The larger subunit, p66, is 560 amino acid long and it exhibits all the enzymatic activities of the RT.<ref name="Giridhar _2009"/> The smaller subunit, called p51, is 440 amino acid long and it is considered to stabilizes the heterodimer but also it may take part in the binding of the [[tRNA]] primer.  The p66 subunit has the two active sites: polymerase and ribonuclease H. The polymerase has four subdomains that have been named “fingers“, “thumb“, “connection“ and “palm“ for it has been compared to the right hand.<ref name=Herschorn_2008/><ref name="Giridhar _2009"/><ref name= Anderson_2007>{{Citation | last1 =Anderson | first1 = K.S.|  title = Reverse transcription of the HIV-1 pandemic | journal =  The FASEB Journal | volume = 21 | issue =  14 |pages =  3795–3808 | year =  2007| url = http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/reprint/21/14/3795| doi=  10.1096/fj.07-8697rev | pmid=17639073}}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Activation of nucleoside and nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors is primarily dependent on cellular entry by [[passive diffusion]] or [[carrier-mediated transport]]. NRTIs are highly [[hydrophilic]] and have limited membrane permeability and therefore this step is very important.
NRTIs are analogues of [[endogenous]] 2´-deoxy-nucleoside and nucleotide. They are inactive in their parent forms and require successive [[phosphorylation]].<ref name=Cihlar_2010/>

Nucleosides must be triphosphorylated, while nucleotides, which possess one phosphonated group, must be diphosphorylated.<ref name="Goldschmidt _2004">{{Citation| last1 = Goldschmidt | first1= V.| last2 =  Marquet| first2=R.|  title = Primer unblocking by HIV-1 reverse transcritptase and resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors| journal = The international journal of biochemistry and cell biology | volume = 36 |pages = 1687–1705| year =  2004| url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6TCH-4CBVS67-5-D&_cdi=5171&_user=713833&_pii=S1357272504001025&_origin=search&_coverDate=09%2F30%2F2004&_sk=999639990&view=c&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkWb&md5=cf0c36b9618e1aa54a19699a2aebaa77&ie=/sdarticle.pdf

Addition of the second phosphate group to nucleoside monophosphate analogues is completed by the nucleoside monophosphate kinases (NMP kinases). A variety of enzymes are able to catalyze the final phosphorylation step for NRTIs, including nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDP kinase), [[phosphoglycerate kinase]], [[pyruvate kinase]] and [[creatine kinase]], resulting in formation of respective antivirally active [[triphosphate]] analogues.<ref name=Cihlar_2010/>
In their respective triphosphate forms, NRTIs and the only NtRTI available compete with their corresponding endogenous deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTPs) for incorporation into the nascent DNA chain (see figure 1).<ref name=Cihlar_2010/> Unlike dNTPs substrate, NRTIs lack a 3´-hydroxyl group on the [[deoxyribose]] moiety. Once incorporated into the DNA chain, the absence of a 3´-hydroxyl group, which normally forms the 5´- to 3´- [[phosphoester]] bond with the next [[nucleic acid]], blocks further extension of the DNA by RT, and they act as chain terminators.<ref name="Goldschmidt _2004"/><ref name="Herschorn _2010">{{Citation| last1 =  Herschorn| first1= A. |

of HIV-1 in October 1991.<ref name= De-Clercq_2009/>
Zalcitabine and didanosine are both obligate chain terminators, that have been developed for anti-HIV treatment. Unfortunately, both drugs lack [[Functional selectivity|selectivity]] and therefore cause [[side-effects]].<ref name=Smith_1998/>

Further modification of the dideoxy framework led to the development of  2´,3´-didehydro-3´-deoxythymidine (stavudine, d4T). Activity of stavudine was shown to be similar to that of zidovudine, although their phosphorylation patterns differ; the
[[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for zidovudine to [[thymidine kinase]] (the enzyme responsible for the first phosphorylation) is similar to that of [[thymidine]], whereas the affinity for stavudine is 700-fold weaker.<ref name=Anderson_2007/>

2',3'‐dideoxy‐3'‐thiacytidine (lamivudine, 3TC) was discovered by  [[Bernard Belleau]]. The history<br />

of lamivudine can be traced back to the mid‐seventies while  Bernard Belleau was investigating sugar [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]]s. Lamivudine was developed as the [[sulfur]] analogue of zalcitabine (see table 2).<ref name=Sneader_2005/> It was initially synthesized as a [[racemic]] mixture (BCH-189) and analysis showed that both positive and negative [[enantiomers]] of BCH-189 (2',3'‐dideoxy‐3'‐thiacytidine) had in vitro activity against HIV. Lamivudine is the negative enantiomer and is a pyrimidine nucleoside<br />
analogue. The 3' carbon of the ribose ring of 2'-deoxycytidine has been replaced by a sulfur<br />
atom because it had greater anti-HIV activity and is less toxic than the positive enantiomer.<ref name=Sneader_2005/><ref name=Ogden_2006>{{Citation | last1 = Ogden

Next in line was 2',3'‐dideoxy‐5-fluoro-3'‐thiacytidine (Emtricitabine, FTC) which is
a structural<br />
[[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] of lamivudine. The structural difference is the 5-fluoro-modification of the<br />
base moiety of lamivudine. It is similar in many ways to lamivudine and is<br />
active against both HIV-1 and hepatitis B virus ([[Hepatitis B virus|HBV]]).<ref name=LaFemina_2009/><ref name=Otto_2004/>

====Carbocyclic nucleoside====
Carbocyclic analogues of dideoxyadenosine were investigated for their anti-HIV activity. Minimal activity was first observed. Many nucleoside analogues were prepared and examined but only one had significant activity and satisfied the requirements for [[clinical trial|clinical]] use. That was 2´,3´-didehydro analogue of dideoxyadenosine. Insertion of a [[cyclopropyl]] group on its 6-amino [[nitrogen]] of the [[adenine]] ring increased [[lipophilicity]] and thus enhanced brain penetration. The resulting compound is known as abacavir (see table 3).<ref name=Sneader_2005/> Abacavir  was approved by the FDA for use in therapy of HIV-1 infections in December 1998.<ref name=Ogden_2006/>

This drug is the only approved antiretroviral that is active as a [[guanosine]] analogue in vivo. First it is monophosphorylated  by adenosine phosphotransferase and then the monophosphate is converted to carbovir 3´-monophosphate. Subsequently it is fully phosphorylated and the carbovir is incorporated by the RT into the DNA chain and acts as a chain terminator. Carbovir is a related guanosine analogue that had poor oral [[bioavailability]] and thus was withdrawn from clinical development.<ref name= Brunton_2009/><br />

====Acyclic nucleotide – the only approved NtRTI====
Nucleotide analogues require only two phosphorylation steps whereas nucleoside analogues require three steps. Reduction in the phosphorylation requirement may allow more rapid and complete conversion of drugs to their active metabolites. Such considerations have led to the development of phosphonate nucleotide analogues such as tenofovir. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Tenofovir DF) is the [[prodrug]] of  tenofovir.

== Resistance ==
Currently, appearance of [[drug resistant]] viruses is an inevitable consequence of prolonged exposure of HIV-1 to antiretroviral therapy. Drug resistance is a serious clinical concern in treatment of viral infection, and it is a particularly difficult problem in treatment of HIV.<ref name="Arnold _2005">{{Citation| last1 =  Arnold| first1= E. | last2 =  Dasa| first2= K.|  last3 =  Hughesc| first3 = S.H. | last4 = Lewib| first4 = P.J. | title = Crystallography and the design of anti-AIDS drugs: conformational flexibility and positional adaptability are important in the design of non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors| journal = Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology | volume = 88 |pages =209–231  | year =  2005| url = http://biomaps.rutgers.edu/DasRTreviewProgBiopMo88_209_2005.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2004.07.001}}</ref> Resistance mutations are known for all approved NRTIs.<ref name="Delviks-Frankenberry _2010">{{Citation| last1 =  Delviks-Frankenberry | first1= K.A. | last2 =  Nikolenko | first2= G.N.|  last3 =  Pathakar | first3 = V.K. | title = The "Connection" Between HIV Drug Resistance and RNase H

Two main mechanisms are known that cause NRTI drug resistance:  Interference with the incorporation of NRTIs and excision of incorporated NRTIs.<ref name="Delviks-Frankenberry _2010"/><ref name="Kirby _2010">{{Citation| last1 =  Kirby| first1= K.A. | last2 =  Marchand| first2= B.|  last3 =  Michailidis| first3 = E. | last4 = Sarafianos | first4 = S.G. | last5 =  Singh| first5 = K. | title = Structural Aspects of Drug Resistance and Inhibition of HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase| journal = Viruses | volume = 2 | issue = 2 |pages =606–638  | year =  2010  | url= http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/2/2/606/pdf |doi=10.3390/v2020606 }}</ref> Interference with the incorporated NRTIs involves a [[mutation]] in the p66 subdomain of the RT.<ref name="Kirby _2010"/> The mutation causes a [[steric hindrance]] that can exclude certain drugs, for example lamivudine, from being incorporated during reverse transcription. In case of excision of incorporated NRTIs the resistant enzymes readily accept the inhibitor as a substrate for incorporation into the DNA chain.<ref name="Kirby _2010"/> Subsequently the RT enzyme can remove the incorporated NRTI by reversing the [[polymerization]] step. The excision reaction requires a pyrophosphate donor which RT joins to the NRTI at the 3´primer terminus, excising it from the primer DNA.<ref name="Kirby _2010"/>
To achieve efficient inhibition of HIV-1 replication in patients, and to delay or prevent appearance of drug resistant viruses, drug combinations are used. [[HAART]], also known as highly active antiretroviral therapy consists of combinations of antiviral drugs which include NRTIs, NtRTI, non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors.<ref name="Bowling _1999">{{Citation| last1 =  Bowling| first1= T.L. | last2 =  Gu| first2= Z.|  last3 =  L´Heureux| first3 = L. | last4 = Muys | first4 = J.M. | last5 = Nguyen-Ba  | first5 = N. | last6 = Rando | first6= R.F. | last7= Wainberg  | first7 = M.A. | title = Mechanism of Action and In Vitro Activity of 1',3'-Dioxolanylpurine Nucleoside Analogues against Sensitive and Drug-Resistant Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Variants | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 43 | issue = 10 |pages = 2376–2382 | year =  1999  | url= http://aac.asm.org/cgi/content/full/43/10/2376 }}</ref>

== Current status ==
Currently, there are several NRTIs in various stages of clinical and [[preclinical]] development. The main reasons for continuing the search for new NRTIs against HIV-1 are to decrease toxicity, increase efficiency against resistant viruses, and simplify anti-HIV-1 treatment.<ref name=Cihlar_2010/><ref name="Delviks-Frankenberry _2010"/><ref name= Agrawala_2008>{{Citation| last1 =  Agrawala | first1= R.K. | last2 =  Krishnan | first2= P.N.

=== Apricitabine (ATC) ===
[[Apricitabine]] is a deoxycytidine analogue. It is structurally related to lamivudine where the positions of the [[oxygen]] and the sulfur are essentially reversed.<ref name=LaFemina_2009/> Even though apricitabine is a little less potent in vitro compared to some other NRTIs, it maintains its activity against a broad spectrum of HIV-1 variants with NRTI resistance mutations. Apricitabine is in the final stage of clinical development for the treatment of NRTI-experienced patients.<ref name=Cihlar_2010/>

=== Elvucitabine (L-d4FC) ===
[[Elvucitabine]] is a deoxycytidine analogue with activity against HIV resistant to several other nucleoside analogues, including zidovudine and lamivudine.<ref name=Otto_2004>{{Citation | last1 = Otto | first1 = M.J. | title = New nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infections | journal = Current Opinion in Pharmacology | volume = 9 | issue = 7 |pages = 839–843 | year = 2003 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6W7F-4D2FFBK-1-5&_cdi=6625&_user=3460687&_pii=S1471489204001195&_origin=search&_coverDate=10%2F01%2F2004&_sk=999959994&view=c&wchp=dGLbVlW-zSkzV&md5=17a5d272263453f40f9f4f8d660e1ac1&ie=/sdarticle.pdf | doi=10.1016/j.coph.2004.06.001}}</ref> This is partly because of high [[intracellular]] levels of its triphosphate [[metabolite]] reached in cells.<ref name=Cihlar_2010/> Clinical trials of elvucitabine are on hold, because it has shown [[bone marrow suppression]] in some patients, with [[CD4+]] cell numbers dropping as early as two days after initiation of dosing.<ref name=Otto_2004/><ref name= Agrawala_2008/>

=== Amdoxovir (DAPD) ===
[[Amdoxovir]] is a guanosine analogue NRTI prodrug that has good bioavailability.<ref name=Cihlar_2010/><ref name=Otto_2004/><ref name= Agrawala_2008/> It is deaminated intracellularly by [[adenosine deaminase]] to [[dioxolane]] guanine (DXG). DXG-triphosphate, the active form of the drug, has greater activity than DAPD-triphosphate.<ref name=Otto_2004/> Amdoxovir is currently in phasa II clinical trials.<ref name=Nguyen-Ba_2000/><ref name= Agrawala_2008/>

=== Racivir (RCV) ===
[[Racivir]] is a racemic mixture of the two β-enantiomers of emtricitabine (FTC), (-)-FTC and (+)-FTC. Racivir has excellent oral bioavailability and has the advantage of needing to be taken only once a day. Racivir can be considered to be used in combination of two NRTIs and has shown promising antiviral activity when used in combination. Racivir is currently in phase II clinical trials.<ref name=Cihlar_2010/><ref name=Otto_2004/><ref name= Agrawala_2008/>

There are several more NRTIs in development. Either the sponsors have filed for an [[Investigational New Drug]] (IND) application, the application has been approved by the FDA or the drugs are in different phases of clinical trials. Some of the NRTIs that are in development  exhibit various attractive pharmacological properties that could make them desirable for the treatment of patients in need of new agents.<ref name=Cihlar_2010/><ref name=Otto_2004/><ref name= Agrawala_2008/>
