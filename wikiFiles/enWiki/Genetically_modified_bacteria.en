The first example of this occurred in 1978 when [[Herbert Boyer]] working at a University of California laboratory took a version of the human [[insulin]] gene and inserted into the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' to produce synthetic "human" insulin. Four years later, it was approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]].

The drug industry has made good use of this discovery in its quest to produce medication for [[diabetes]].<ref name=Walsh2005>{{cite journal

For instance, the bacteria which cause [[tooth decay]] are called ''Streptococcus mutans''. These bacteria consume leftover sugars in the mouth, producing [[lactic acid]] that corrodes [[tooth enamel]] and ultimately causes cavities. Scientists have recently modified ''Streptococcus mutans'' to produce no lactic acid.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hillman JD |title=Genetically modified Streptococcus mutans for the prevention of dental caries |journal=Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek |volume=82 |issue=1-4 |pages=361–6 |year=2002 |month=August |pmid=12369203 |doi=10.1023/A:1020695902160}}</ref> These transgenic bacteria, if properly colonized in a person's mouth, could reduce the formation of cavities.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hillman JD, Mo J, McDonell E, Cvitkovitch D, Hillman CH |title=Modification of an effector strain for replacement therapy of dental caries to enable clinical safety trials |journal=J.
