'''Oligospermia''', also '''oligozoospermia''', refers to [[semen]] with a low concentration of [[sperm]]<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/oligospermia thefreedictionary.com > oligospermia] Citing: Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers, 2007 by Saunders; The American Heritage Medical Dictionary 2007, 2004 by Houghton Mifflin Company; Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition 2009; McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine, 2002 by The McGraw-Hill Companies</ref> and is a common finding in [[male infertility]]. Often semen with a decreased sperm concentration may also show significant abnormalities in sperm morphology and motility (technically "oligoasthenoteratozoospermia"). There has been interest in replacing the descriptive terms used in semen analysis with more quantitative information.<ref>Grimes DA & Lopez LM 2007 Fertility and Sterility 88(6):1491-94.</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of oligospermia is based on one low count in a [[semen analysis]] performed on two occasions. For many decades sperm concentrations of less than 20 million sperm/ml were considered low or oligospermic, recently, however, the [[WHO]] reassessed sperm criteria and established a lower reference point, less than 15 million sperm/ml, consistent with the 5th percentile for fertile men.<ref name=who2010>{{cite journal |author=Cooper TG, Noonan E, von Eckardstein S, ''et al.'' |title=World Health Organization reference values for human semen characteristics |journal=Hum. Reprod. Update |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=231–45 |year=2010 |pmid=19934213 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmp048 |url=}}</ref> Sperm concentrations fluctuate and oligospermia may be temporary or permanent.

The diagnosis of oligospermia requires a work-up (listed in [[Male infertility]]).

==Causes==
{{Further|Semen quality}}

There are many causes for oligospermia including:<ref>Rowe PJ, [[Frank Comhaire|Comhaire FH]], Hargreave TB, Mahmoud AMA. ''WHO Manual for the Standardized Investigation, Diagnosis and Management of the Infertile Male''. [[Cambridge University Press]], 2000. ISBN 0-521-77474-8.</ref>

===Pre-testicular causes===
Pre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including:
  
*[[Hypogonadism]] due to various causes
*[[Drugs]], [[alcohol]], [[smoking]]
*Strenuous riding ([[bicycle riding]],<ref name="pmid15716187">{{cite journal |author=Leibovitch I, Mor Y |title=The vicious cycling: bicycling related urogenital disorders |journal=Eur.

*[[Medication]]s, including [[androgen]]s.

===Testicular factors===
Testicular factors refer to conditions where the testes produces semen of poor quality despite adequate hormonal support and include:

*[[Paternal age effect|Age]]
*Genetic defects on the [[Y chromosome]]
** [[Y chromosome microdeletion]]s
*Abnormal set of chromosomes
** [[Klinefelter syndrome]]
*[[Neoplasm]], e.g. [[seminoma]]
*[[Cryptorchidism]]
*[[Varicocele]] (14% in one study)<ref name="title">{{cite web |url=http://www.umm.edu/patiented/articles/what_causes_of_male_infertility_000067_4.htm |title=Infertility in men |accessdate=2007-11-21 |work=}}</ref><ref name="pmid11744480">{{cite journal |author=Costabile RA, Spevak M |title=Characterization of patients presenting with male factor infertility in an equal access, no cost medical system |journal=Urology |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=1021–4 |year=2001 |pmid=11744480 |doi=10.1016/S0090-4295(01)01400-5}}</ref>

[[Mast cell]]s releasing inflammatory mediators appear to directly suppress [[sperm motility]] in a potentially reversible manner, and may be a common pathophysiological mechanism for several of the above mentioned factors.<ref name=Menzies2011>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmq053 }}</ref>

===Post-testicular causes===
Post-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in [[ejaculation]]: 

*[[Vas deferens]] obstruction
*Lack of [[Vas deferens]], often related to genetic markers for [[Cystic Fibrosis]]
*[[Infection]], e.g. [[prostatitis]]
*[[Ejaculatory duct obstruction]]

===Idiopathic oligospermia (oligoasthenoteratozoospermia)===
In about 30% of infertile men no causative factor is found for their decrease in sperm concentration or quality by common clinical, instrumental, or laboratory means, and the condition is termed "idiopathic" (unexplained).<ref name=cavallini>{{cite journal| author=Cavallini G |title=Male idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia |journal=Asian J Androl | volume=8| issue=2| pages=143–57 |doi= 10.1111/j.1745-7262.2006.00123.x| year=2006|pmid=16491265}}</ref> A number of factors may be involved in the genesis of this condition, including age, infectious agents ( such as ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]''), [[Y chromosome microdeletion]]s, [[mitochondria]]l changes, environmental [[pollutant]]s, and "subtle" hormonal changes.<ref name=cavallini/>

==Treatment==
Treatment takes place within the context of infertility management and needs also to consider the fecundity of the female partner. Thus the choices can be complex.

In a number of situations direct medical or surgical intervention can improve the sperm concentration, examples are use of FSH  in men with pituitary [[hypogonadism]], antibiotics in case of infections,  or operative corrections of a [[hydrocele]], [[varicocele]], or vas deferens obstruction.

In most cases of oligospermia including its idiopathic form there is no direct medical or surgical intervention agreed to be effective. Empirically many medical approaches have been tried including [[clomiphene citrate]], [[tamoxifen]], [[hMG (medication)|HMG]], [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]],  [[human chorionic gonadotropin|HCG]], [[testosterone]], [[Vitamin E]], [[Vitamin C]], [[anti-oxidants]], [[carnitine]], [[acetyl-L-carnitine]], [[zinc]], [[high-protein diet]]s. In a number of pilot studies some positive results have been obtained. Clomiphene citrate has been used with modest success.<ref name=check/> The combination of tamoxifen plus testosterone was reported to improve the sperm situation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Adamopoulos DA, Nicopoulou S, Kapolla N, Karamertzanis M, Andreou E. |title=The combination of testosterone undecanoate with tamoxifen citrate enhances the effects of each agent given independently on seminal parameters in men with idiopathic oligozoospermia.|journal=Fertil Steril. |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=756–62 |year=1997 |pmid=9093207 }}</ref>

The use of [[carnitine]] showed some promise in a controlled trial in selected cases of male infertility improving sperm quality and further studies are needed.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Lenzi A, Lombardo F, Sgro P, Salacone P, Caponecchia L, Dondero F, Gandini L |title=Use of carnitine therapy in selected cases of male factor infertility: a double-blind crossover trial. |journal=Fertility and Sterility  | pmid=12569937| year=1991| volume=25| issue=5| pages=1253–326}}</ref>

In many situations, [[intrauterine insemination]]s are performed with success.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Francavilla F, Sciarretta F, Sorgentone S, Necozione S, Santucci R, Barbonetti A, Francavilla S.| title=Intrauterine insemination with or without mild ovarian stimulation in couples with male subfertility due to oligo/astheno- and/or teratozoospermia or antisperm antibodies: a prospective cross-over trial. |journal=Fertil Steril. | volume=92| issue=3| pages=1009–11| year=2009| pmid=19261275| doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.01.112}}</ref> In more severe cases [[IVF]], or IVF - [[ICSI]] is done<ref name=check>{{cite journal| author=Check JH| title=Treatment of male infertility. |journal=Clin Exp Obstet Gynecol. | volume=34| issue=4| pages=201–6| year=2007 |pmid= 18225678}}</ref> and is often the best option, specifically if time is a factor or fertility problems coexist on the female side.
The [[Low dose Estrogen Testosterone Combination Therapy]] may improve sperm count and motility in some men.<ref name=Sah>{{cite journal|last=Sah|first=P|title=Role of low-dose estrogen-testosterone combination therapy in men with oligospermia.|journal=Fertility and sterility|date=1998 Oct|volume=70|issue=4|pages=780-1|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9797116|pmid=9797116}}</ref> including severe oligospermia.<ref name=Sah2>{{cite journal|last=Sah|first=P|title=Oligospermia due to partial maturation arrest responds to low dose estrogen-testosterone combination therapy resulting in live-birth: a case report.|journal=Asian journal of andrology|date=2002 Dec|volume=4|issue=4|pages=307-8|pmid=12508135|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12508135}}</ref><ref name=Sah3>{{cite journal|last=Sah|first=P|title=Oligospermia In A Man With Small Testes And Elevated Serum FSH Responds To Low Dose Estrogen-Testosterone Combination Therapy, Resulting In His Wife's Pregnancy And Live Birth|journal=The Internet Journal of Endocrinology|date=1 January 2005|volume=2|issue=1|doi=10.5580/1f84|url=http://archive.ispub.com/journal/the-internet-journal-of-endocrinology/volume-2-number-1/oligospermia-in-a-man-with-small-testes-and-elevated-serum-fsh-responds-to-low-dose-estrogen-testosterone-combination-therapy-resulting-in-his-wife-s-pregnancy-and-live-birth.html#sthash.f8jeajoT.dpbs}}</ref>

==Fertility==
Achieving a pregnancy naturally may be a challenge if the male suffers from a low sperm count.  However, chances are good if the female partner is fertile; many couples with this problem have been successful. Prognosis is more limited if there is a combination of factors that include sperm dysfunction and reduced [[ovarian reserve]].
