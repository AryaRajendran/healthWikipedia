'''Superfecundation''' is the fertilization of two or more [[ovum|ova]] from the same [[menstrual cycle|cycle]] by [[spermatozoon|sperm]] from separate acts of [[sexual intercourse]]. The term ''superfecundation'' is derived from ''[[fecundity|fecund]]'', meaning the ability to produce offspring.

'''Heteropaternal superfecundation''' occurs when two different males father [[Twin#Dizygotic twins|fraternal twins]]. When the parents of fraternal twins are involved in a [[paternity (law)|paternity]] suit, the odds are about 1 in 40 that the children are actually [[Sibling#half|half-siblings]].<ref name="suit">{{Cite journal |author=Wenk RE, Houtz T, Brooks M, Chiafari FA |title=How frequent is heteropaternal superfecundation? |journal=Acta geneticae medicae et gemellologiae |year=1992 |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=43–7 |pmid=1488855 |quote=The frequency of HS among dizygotic twins whose parents were involved in paternity suits is 2.4%}}</ref>

In common usage, the term ''superfecundation'' is often used instead of ''heteropaternal superfecundation''. The terms are practically equivalent because, though it is speculated that superfecundation by the same father is a common occurrence, it can only be proven to have occurred when there are multiple fathers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=James |first1=William H. |year=1980 |title=Gestational age in twins |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood |volume=55 |pages=281–284 |accessdate=2011-03-17 |pmc=1626817 |pmid=7191240 |issue=4}}</ref>

== Conception ==
Superfecundation most commonly happens within hours or days of the first instance of fertilization with ova released during the same cycle. There is a small time window when eggs are able to be fertilized. Sperm cells can live inside a female's body for 4–5 days. Once ovulation occurs, the egg remains viable for 12–48 hours before it begins to disintegrate. Thus, the fertile period can span 5–7 days. 

[[Ovulation]] is usually suspended during [[pregnancy]] to prevent further ova becoming fertilized and to help increase the chances of a full term pregnancy. However, if an ovum is released after the female was already impregnated when previously ovulating, there is a chance of a second pregnancy—albeit at a different stage of development. This is known as [[superfetation]].

==Heteropaternal superfecundation==<!-- section link to [[Painted turtle]] -->
Heteropaternal superfecundation is common in animals such as [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s. Stray dogs often produce litters in which every puppy has a different father. Though rare in humans, cases have been documented. In one study on humans, the frequency was 2.4% among [[dizygotic twin]]s whose parents had been involved in [[paternity suit]]s.<ref name="suit"/>

==Use in mythology==
In [[Greek mythology]], [[Heracles]] and his twin [[Iphicles]] are examples of heteropaternal superfecundation, with Heracles fathered by the god [[Zeus]] and Iphicles by a mortal man Amphitryon.

In another Greek myth, [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] conceives four children ([[Helen of Troy]], [[Clytemnestra]], and [[Castor and Pollux]]) in the same night by two different men. Two are children of Zeus, who comes to Leda disguised as a swan, and two are the children of Leda's mortal husband, [[Tyndareus]]. Which men father which children varies widely among accounts, in some cases establishing that the Gemini twins Castor and Pollux are born of different fathers. The heteropaternal superfecundation involved in this myth is especially unusual, because instead of giving birth to the children, Leda lays eggs that hatch them.
