'''Esophageal dilatation''' is a therapeutic [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] procedure that enlarges the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the [[esophagus]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Welsh JD, Griffiths WJ, McKee J, Wilkinson D, Flournoy DJ, Mohr JA |title=Bacteremia associated with esophageal dilatation |journal=J.

It can be used to treat a number of medical conditions that result in narrowing of the esophageal lumen, or decrease motility in the distal esophagus.  These include the following:
*[[Esophageal stricture|Peptic stricture]]
*[[Schatzki ring]]s
*[[Achalasia]]
*[[Scleroderma]] esophagus
*Rarely [[esophageal cancer]]

==Types of dilators==
There are three major classes of dilators:

*'''Mercury weighted bougies''' are blindly inserted [[bougie]]s placed into the esophagus by the treating [[physician]].  They are passed in sequentially increasing sizes to dilate the obstructed area.  They must be used with precaution in patients with narrow strictures, as they may curl proximal to the obstruction.  The most commonly used mercury weighted bougies are the '''Maloney''' bougie dilators.
*'''Bougie over guidewire dilators''' are used at the time of [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy|gastroscopy]] or [[fluoroscopy]].  An [[endoscopy]] is usually performed first to evaluate the anatomy, and a guidewire is passed into the [[stomach]] past the obstruction.  This may also be done fluoroscopically.  Bougies are again introduced—this time over the guidewire—in sequentially increasing sizes.  The most commonly used bougie over guidewire dilators are the '''Savary''' or '''Savary-Gilliard''' dilators.
*'''Pneumatic dilatation''' or '''balloon dilatation''' is also typically done at the time of endoscopy or fluoroscopy.  A balloon is inserted in the deflated form into the area of narrowing.  It is then inflated with air to a certain pressure that is pre-set for a given circumference.

==Complications==
Complications of esophageal dilatation include the following:
*[[odynophagia]], or painful swallowing
*[[hematemesis]], or bloody vomit
*[[Boerhaave syndrome|esophageal perforation]]
*[[mediastinitis]]
