'''Kenneth Blum''' (born August 8, 1939) is a researcher on [[neuropsychopharmacology]] and [[genetics]]. He is known from his study on the genetics of [[alcoholism]] published in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' in 1990. He works in the fields of [[neuropsychiatry]] and genetics, nutritional genetics, and [[pharmacogenetics]]. Blum's research has been recognized through numerous awards.

Blum is currently an adjunct full [[professor]] in the Department of Psychiatry, [[University of Florida College of Medicine]], and Mcknight Brain Institute (Gainesville, Florida), and formerly of the Department of Physiology & Pharmacology at [[Wake Forest University]] School of Medicine (Winston-Salem, North Carolina). Until 2008 he was also Chief Scientific Officer of Salugen, Inc., a personalized health and wellness company in San Diego, California.<ref name=24-7PressRelease2008>{{citation |date=September 10, 2008 |title=Kenneth Blum, PhD, Resigns from Salugen, Inc.

Currently he is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Scientific Officer of LifeGen Inc. (San Diego, California), a neutrigenomic evidence-based corporation.

== Academic background ==
Blum received his [[B.S.]] in [[pharmacy]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1961, his [[M.S.]] in medical science in 1965 from the [[New Jersey College of Medicine]], and his [[Ph.D.]] in pharmacology in 1968 from the [[New York Medical College]]. Blum completed post-doctorate research in psychopharmacology at the [[Southwest Foundation for Research and Education]] where Irving Geller was his mentor. He also completed a fellowship in pharmacogenetics under [[Gerald McClearn]] at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] College of Pharmacy (Boulder) in 1977. 

== Genetic research on addictions ==
Blum's most important work was a 1990 study he co-led with Ernest Noble, the former director of the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]], that correlated the [[dopamine]] D2 Receptor Taq 1 allele with alcoholism. This study was published in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association''. Blum expanded his research of genes involved in brain reward circuitry. By the early 1980s there were many suggestions that alcoholism had genetic antecedents and a high [[heritability]]. This research stimulated further studies of gene associations. Though the press has called his finding the "alcoholic gene," Blum believed his work to be of broader scope, calling this gene a "reward gene" which covers other addictive behaviors including drug addiction, smoking, overeating, and pathological gambling.
