The '''German National Library of Medicine''' ({{lang-de|Deutsche Zentralbibliothek für Medizin}}), abbreviated '''ZB MED''', is the [[national library]] of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] for medicine, health sciences, nutrition, agriculture and the environment. It has two locations: [[Cologne]] and [[Bonn]]. The library is jointly financed by the [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Health]] and the 16 [[States of Germany]]. It is operated under the auspices of the German state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].

The [[medical library]] was initially formed 1973 through the mergers of several much older institutions. Between 2001 and 2003 it was further expanded to include [[nutrition science|nutritional]], [[environmental sciences|environmental]] and [[agricultural sciences]]. As a result, today ZB MED is the world's largest specialist library in its five subjects<ref name = datacite>[http://datacite.org/ZBMED DataCite] retrieved 23-May-2012</ref> and the largest medical library in Europe.<ref>Theime Publishing Group license with ZB MED [http://www.thieme.de/connect-en/tc_apr_30_08.html online] retrieved 23-May-2012</ref>

== History ==
The roots of the ZB MED can be traced to two predecessor institutions important to the heritage of the [[Rhineland]], one founded in 1847 in [[Bonn]] and another in 1908 in [[Cologne]].<ref name = ZBhistory/>

=== Cologne ===
The Academy of Practical Medicine ({{lang-de|Akademie für praktische Medizin}}) established a hospital library in 1908 and it became a department of the University and City Library of Cologne ({{lang-de|Universitäts- und Stadtbibliothek Köln}}) in 1920. The library survived [[World War II]] intact and in 1949 the [[German Research Foundation]] (DFG) granted it nationwide responsibility for collecting medical literature in [[West Germany]]. It also began collecting English language publications through financial support from the DFG.  By 1963 the library held 250,000 books and subscribed to 1,100 journal titles.<ref name = ZBhistory>[http://www.zbmed.de/en/about-us/history.html History of the ZB MED] retrieved 23-May-2012</ref>

In 1964, the German Science Council recommended that an independent National Library of Medicine be formed out of the University and City Library's medical department. Formally established in 1973, it was given a mandate to acquire relevant material in all medical subjects and languages. In 1994 the library's name was changed to the “Deutsche Zentralbibliothek für Medizin” and in 1999 moved to a new building on the campus of the Hospital of the [[University of Cologne]].<ref name = ZBhistory/>

=== Bonn ===
In 1847 the Royal Agricultural Academy ({{lang-de|Königlich Landwirthschaftliche Akademie}}) was founded in [[Bonn]]-Poppelsdorf and it became a full degree-granting university in 1919. In 1934 the Agricultural University was incorporated into the [[University of Bonn]] and the library became a department of the main university library. By 1950 it was the largest agricultural library in [[West Germany]].<ref name = ZBhistory/><ref>[http://www.lwf.uni-bonn.de/ University of Bonn Faculty of Agriculture] {{icon de}} retrieved 23-May-2012</ref> In 1962 the library was renamed the National Library of Agricultural Science ({{lang-de|Zentralbibliothek der Landbauwissenschaft}}) and given nationwide responsibility for agriculture by the [[German Research Foundation]] DFG. It became the German center for the [[Agricultural Libraries Network]] (AGLINET) in 1971 and moved into a new building in 1983. In 1997 the building was subject to an arson attack requiring extensive remodeling, although none of its 300,000 items were lost.<ref name = ZBhistory/>

=== One institution ===
In 1999 the German Science Council recommended Bonn University's agricultural library be merged with the ZB MED. The subject areas of nutrition and the environment were incorporated in 2001 followed by agriculture in 2003. Since then ZB MED operates as ''ZB MED Medicine. Health.'' at the site in Cologne and ''ZB MED Nutrition. Environment. Agriculture.'' at the site in Bonn.<ref name = ZBhistory/>

== Collection ==
The book collection primarily consists of German and English-language volumes, while journals are acquired in all languages and from all countries. The library is a particular specialist in the acquisition of "gray literature", difficult to obtain and not available via the standard book or journal trade.<ref>Miriam A. Drake (ed.): ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science, First Update Supplement'' CRC Press; 2nd edition (June 2, 2005) ISBN 978-0849338946</ref> As of 2011, it holds:

* 1.5 million books
* 9000 journal titles (196,000 articles delivered annually)
* 25 million documents

The library's physical collection spans over 38km of bookshelves.<ref name = ZBchannel/>

Users are primarily students, doctors, scientists and industry clients, although the library is open to general public. There is no charge for using the library buildings or borrowing books.<ref>[http://www.zbmed.de/en/general-information/information-for-visitors.html ZB MED Information for Visitors] retrieved 23-May-2012</ref> The library also provides access to its collections via its own online portals for searching, full-text reading and ordering hard copies. Access to full text journal articles is also available through the Electronic Journals Library (EZB) <ref>Electronic Journals Library (EZB) [http://rzblx1.uni-regensburg.de/ezeit/fl.phtml?bibid=ZBMED&colors=7&lang=en&notation=ALL ZB MED holdings online], retrieved 23-May-2012</ref> Since December 2010 all the catalog data of ZB MED is freely licensed under [[CC0]].<ref>Heike Grelka: ''Die ZB MED unterstützt mir der Freigabe ihrer Katalogdaten eine stärkere Integration der Bibliotheken ins Web'' (Informationsdienst Wissenschaft, 2010) [http://idw-online.de/pages/de/news401502 idw-online] {{icon de}} retrieved 23-May-2012</ref>

== Open access publishing ==
ZB MED operates or participates in several large [[open access]] initiatives.

* '''ElliNET''' is a service developed and operated by ZB MED which offers authors the opportunity to publish scientific texts, medical journal articles, conference materials and research reports in accordance with [[open access]] principles. Works can be published, archived and accessed without restriction and there is no charge. ElliNET also serves as the institutional repository for the Medical Faculty of the [[University of Cologne]] as well as its graduate and post-graduate programs.<ref>[http://www.zbmed.de/en/publishing-services/ellinet.html ElliNET – The ZB MED’s Document and Publication Service] retrieved 23-May-2012</ref>
* '''German Medical Science''' (GMS), co-founded by ZB MED in 2003, is an open access peer-reviewed publications platform where authors retain copyright and dissemination rights.<ref>Ulrich Korwitz: ''German Medical Science open access publication system'' (Berlin: Humboldt-Universität, 2007) [http://oansuche.open-access.net/oansearch/metadata?oid=4956 Online] retrieved 23-May-2012</ref>
* '''[[CKAN]]''' is used by ZB MED to further extended its open access philosophy by registering datasets on journal articles. In 2011 it published datasets on 650,000 articles from about 650 German-language journals. 90% of the data wasn't part of the [[MedLine]] data set. It published further datasets on over 9,000 articles from 200 journals in the applied [[life sciences]].<ref>Adrian Pohl: ''ZB MED Publishes Open Article Data in Medicine and Life Sciences'' Open Knowledge Foundation, 06-Sept-2011 [http://openbiblio.net/2011/09/06/zb-med-publishes-open-article-data-in-medicine-and-life-sciences/ Online] retrieved 23-May-2012</ref>

== Search portals ==
As a member of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community]], ZB MED is charged with providing infrastructure facilities for science and research funded by the [[German Research Foundation]] (DFG). It operates two Web portals which function as virtual specialist libraries: MEDPILOT [http://www.medpilot.de] (for medicine) and [[GREENPILOT]] [http://www.greenpilot.de] (for nutrition, environment and agriculture). In 2009, GREENPILOT was given an award as a “Landmark in the Land of Ideas” by the [[President of Germany]].<ref name = goethe>Dagmar Giersberg: ''Rhineland Giant – The German National Library of Medicine'' (Bonn: Goethe Institute, 2010) [http://www.goethe.de/wis/bib/dos/bip/nrw/en6722475.htm Online] retrieved 23-May-2012 </ref> <ref>
