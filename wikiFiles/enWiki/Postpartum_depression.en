'''Postpartum depression''' ('''PPD'''), also called '''postnatal depression''', is a type  of [[clinical depression]] which can affect women, and less frequently men, typically after [[childbirth]]. Studies report prevalence rates among women from 5% to 25%, but methodological differences among the studies make the actual prevalence rate unclear. Among men, in particular new fathers, the incidence of postpartum depression has been estimated to be between 1% and 25.5%.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Paulson |first=James F. |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/depression/content/article/10168/1519072 |title=Focusing on depression in expectant and new fathers: prenatal and postpartum depression not limited to mothers |journal=Psychiatry Times |year=2010 |volume=27 |number=2}}</ref> Postpartum depression occurs in women after they have carried a child. Symptoms include sadness, fatigue, changes in sleeping and eating patterns, reduced libido, crying episodes, anxiety, and irritability. Although a number of risk factors have been identified, the causes of PPD are not well understood. Many women recover with a treatment consisting of a support group or counseling.<ref>Kinnaman, Gary & Jacobs, Richard. Seeing in the Dark.

== Symptoms ==
Symptoms of PPD can occur anytime in the first year postpartum.<ref name="OBOS">The Boston Women's Health Book Collective: Our Bodies Ourselves, pages 489–491, New York: Touchstone Book, 2005</ref> These include, but are not limited to, the following:

== Onset and duration==
Postpartum depression usually begins in the first few months after childbirth. In [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition]] it is defined as depression with onset within 4 weeks after childbirth. Postpartum depression can also affect women who have suffered a miscarriage.<ref name=Miller-2002>{{cite journal

== Risk factors ==
While the causes of PPD are not understood, a number of factors have been identified as predictors of PPD:

*[[Childbirth-related_posttraumatic_stress_disorder|birth-related psychological trauma]]
*[[Birth_trauma_(physical)|birth-related physiological trauma]]

Of these, formula feeding, a history of depression, and cigarette smoking have been shown to be additive effects.<ref name=McCoy-200604 />

These factors are known to [[correlation|correlate]] with PPD. "Correlation" in this case means that, for example, high levels of prenatal depression are associated with high levels of postnatal depression, and low levels of prenatal depression are associated with low levels of postnatal depression. But this does not mean the prenatal depression causes postnatal depression—they might both be caused by some third factor. In contrast, some factors, such as lack of social support, almost certainly ''cause'' postpartum depression. (The ''causal'' role of lack of social support in PPD is strongly suggested by several studies, including O'Hara 1985, Field et al. 1985; and Gotlib et al. 1991.) Anthropologists Kruckman and Stern tested the idea cross culturally, and their pioneering study determined six ways in which postpartum rituals, including the use of the postpartum ritual, la cuarentena, in Chicago Latina mothers, to protect or cushion the expression of mood disorders.<ref>Stern, G., Kruckman, L. "Multi-Disciplinary Perspectives on Postpartum Depression: An Anthropological Critique," Social Science and Medicine, Vol. 17, 15, pages 1027-1041, 1983.</ref>

In addition to Beck’s meta-analysis cited above, other academic studies have shown a correlation between a mother’s [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[social class]] and/or [[sexual orientation]] and postpartum depression. In 2006 Segre et al., conducted a study "on the extent to which [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]/ethnicity is a risk factor" for PPD.<ref name="Segre">Segre, Lisa S, Mary E. Losch, Michael W. O’Hara. Race/Ethnicity and Perinatal Depressed Mood. Journal of Reproductive and Infant Psychology. Vol 24 No 2: 99–106</ref> Studying 26,877 postpartum women they found that 15.7% were depressed. Of the women who suffered from PPD, African American women suffered at a rate of 25.2%, American Indian/Native Alaskan women at 22.9%, Caucasian women at 15.5%, Hispanic women at 15.3%, and 11.5% for those reporting Asian/Pacific Islander. Even when "important social factors such as age, income, education, marital status, and baby’s health were controlled, African American women still emerged with significantly increased risk for…PPD".<ref name="Segre"/>

Segre et al., also found a correlation between a mother’s [[social class]] and PPD. Not surprisingly, women with fewer resources indicate a higher level of postpartum depression and stress than those with more financial resources. Rates of PPD decreased as income increased as follows:<ref name="Segre"/>  Women with fewer resources are also more likely to have an unintended or unwanted pregnancy, further increasing risk of PPD. Beck (2001) concurs with this, stating that these women are at risk for PPD because they may experience stressors such as financial difficulties. Single mothers of low income may have fewer resources that they have access to while transitioning into motherhood.

Likewise, a study conducted by Howell et al. in 2006 confirms Segre’s findings that women who are not Caucasian and in lower socioeconomic categories have more symptoms of PPD.<ref name="Howell">Howell, Elizabeth A, Pablo Mora, Howard Leventhal. Correlates of Early Postpartum Depressive Symptoms. Maternal and Child Health Journal. Vol 10 No 2: 149–157</ref>

In a 2007 study conducted by Ross et al., lesbian and bisexual mothers were tested for PPD and then compared with a heterosexual sample. Ross et al. found that "lesbian and bisexual biological mothers had significantly higher Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores than the…sample of heterosexual women."<ref name="Ross">Ross, Lori E, L Steele, C Goldfinger, and C Strike. Perinatal Depressive Symptomatology Among Lesbian and Bisexual Women. Archives of Women’s Mental Health. Vol 10 No 2: 53–59</ref> The Ross study suggests that PPD may be more common among lesbian and bisexual mothers. From a study conducted in 2005 by Ross, the higher rates of PPD in lesbian/bisexual mothers than heterosexual mothers may be due to less "social support, particularly from their families of origin and…additional stress due to homophobic discrimination" in society.<ref name="Ross2">Ross, Lori E.

==Causes==
The [[etiology]] of PPD is not well understood.
It is sometimes assumed that postpartum depression is caused by a lack of vitamins.<ref>John L. Beard, et. al.; J. Nutr. 135: 267–272, 2005.</ref> Other studies tend to show that more likely causes are the significant changes in a woman's hormones during pregnancy.<ref>Soares CN, Zitek B. Reproductive hormone sensitivity and risk for depression across the female life cycle: a continuum of vulnerability? J Psychiatry Neurosci. 2008 Jul;33(4):331-43.</ref> Yet other studies have suggested there is no known correlation between hormones and postpartum mood disorders,<ref name=Miller-2002>{{cite journal

Further, fathers, who are not undergoing profound hormonal changes, suffer PPD at relatively high rates. <ref name=-2004>{{cite journal

Finally, all mothers experience these hormonal changes, yet only about 10–15% suffer PPD. This does ''not'' mean, however, that hormones do not play a role in PPD.<ref>[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/157/6/924 Block et al. (2000).]</ref> For example, ''in women with a history of PPD'', a hormone treatment simulating pregnancy and parturition caused these women to suffer mood symptoms. The same treatment, however, did not cause mood symptoms in women with no history of PPD. One interpretation of these results is that there is a subgroup of women who are vulnerable to hormone changes during pregnancy. Another interpretation is that simulating a pregnancy will trigger PPD in women who are vulnerable to PPD for any of the reasons indicated by Beck's meta-analysis as summarized above.

Profound [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] changes brought about by caring for the [[infant]] are also frequently claimed to cause PPD, but, again, there is little evidence for this hypothesis. Mothers who have had several previous children without suffering PPD can nonetheless suffer it with their latest child. <ref name=-2000>{{cite journal

Plus, most women experience profound lifestyle changes with their first pregnancy, yet most do not suffer PPD.

In 2009, researchers at the [[University of California, Irvine]], reported that the levels of placental [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH) during the 25th week of pregnancy may help predict a woman's chances of developing postpartum depression.<ref name="pmid18303075">{{cite journal |author=Rich-Edwards JW |title=Elevated Midpregnancy Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Is Associated with Prenatal, But Not Postpartum, Maternal Depression |journal=J.

===Evolutionary psychological hypothesis===
Research suggests that PPD is a functional component of human reproductive decision-making, research supports the notion that PPD declined mothers investment in their offspring.<ref name=Hagan-1999>{{cite journal

Human infants require an extraordinary degree of care. Lack of support and insufficient investment from fathers and/or other family members will increase the costs borne by mothers, whereas infant health problems will reduce the evolutionary benefits to be gained.<ref name=Hagan-1999 /> If ancestral mothers did not receive enough support from fathers or other family members, they may not have been able to afford raising the new infant without harming any existing children, or damaging their own health (nursing depletes mothers' nutritional stores, placing the health of poorly nourished women in jeopardy). 

For mothers suffering inadequate social support or other costly and stressful circumstances, negative emotions directed towards a new infant could serve an important evolved function by causing the mother to reduce her investment in an unaffordable infant, thereby reducing her costs. Numerous studies support the correlation between postpartum depression and lack of social support or other childcare stressors.<ref name=Beck-200109 /><ref name=Hagan-1999 />
Kruckman, using observations from anthropological field work, suggests that supportive rituals and knowledge, if projected to the mother in a meaningful and sincere fashion, can affect the hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal function and the production of endocrine signal molecules, and reduce the expression of anxiety or panic in postpartum women.<ref>Kruckman, L. "Rituals as Prevention: The Case of Postpartum Depression," In The Nature and Function of Rituals, Ruth-Inge Heinze, Greenwood Publishing, 1999.</ref><ref>Kruckman, L. "A Renewed Call for a Biocultural Understanding of Postpartum Depression Etiology," paper presented at the Max Planck Institute International Symposium, "Postpartum Dysphoria & Depression: Anthropological, Ethnopsychiatric & Evolutionary Dimensions" Reimers Stiftung, Bad Homburg, Germany, 2000.</ref>

Mothers with postpartum depression can unconsciously exhibit fewer positive emotions and more negative emotions toward their children, are less responsive and less sensitive to infant cues, less emotionally available, have a less successful maternal role attainment, and have infants that are less securely attached; and in more extreme cases, some women may have thoughts of harming their children (Beck 1995, 1996b; Cohn et al. 1990, 1991; Field et al. 1985; Fowles 1996; Hoffman and Drotar 1991; Jennings et al. 1999; Murray 1991; Murray and Cooper 1996). In other words, most mothers with PPD are suffering some kind of cost, like inadequate social support, and consequently are mothering less. 

In this view, mothers with PPD do not have a ''mental illness'', but instead cannot afford to take care of the new infant without more social support, more resources, etc. Treatment should therefore focus on helping mothers get what they need. (See [http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/projects/human/ppd.pdf Hagen 1999] and [http://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/~hagen/papers/perinatal.pdf Hagen and Barrett, n.d.])

==Effects on the parent-infant relationship==
Postpartum depression may lead mothers to be inconsistent with [[childcare]]. Women diagnosed with postpartum depression often focus more on the negative events of childcare, resulting in poor coping strategies (Murray). 

There are four groups of coping methods, each divided into a different style of coping subgroups. [[Avoidance coping]] is one of the most common strategies used (Murray). It consists of denial and behavioral disengagement subgroups (for example, an avoidant mother might not respond to her baby crying). This strategy however, does not resolve any problems and ends up negatively impacting the mother’s mood, similarly of the other coping strategies used (Honey).

<blockquote>'''Four coping strategies:'''

*  '''''Avoidance coping:''''' [[denial]], behavioral disengagement
*  '''''Problem-focused coping:''''' active coping, planning, positive reframing
*  '''''Support seeking coping:''''' emotional support, instrumental support
*  '''''Venting coping:''''' venting, [[Blame#Self-blame|self-blame]] </blockquote>

===Security===

Multiple factors must be considered when evaluating the capacity of a seriously depressed mother to provide a safe-enough caregiving environment that can support the healthy development of her baby and her relationship with that baby.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Almeida A, Merminod G, Schechter DS | year = 2009 | title = Mothers with severe psychiatric illness and their newborns:  a hospital-based model of perinatal consultation | url = | journal = Journal of ZERO-TO-THREE: National Center for Infants, Toddlers, and Families | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 40–46 }}</ref> Such factors, including maternal attachment history, present social supports, insight, and ability to accept help are often best considered by an interdisciplinary professional treatment team that includes infant mental health specialists or other mental health practitioners with experience in working with children and families.

===Attachment study===

A study by Edhborg on mother-child attachment looked at 45 randomly selected mother-child pairs. These pairs were chosen using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale<ref>[http://www.dbpeds.org/media/edinburghscale.pdf Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale]</ref> (EPDS) form, measuring postpartum depression in the community. 326 women returned the form and of the 326, 24 scoring above twelve were recruited and 21 women scoring less than nine were recruited. A score above twelve is considered "potentially depressed" and a score of less than nine is considered to have no form of depression. The 45 mother-child pairs were videotaped, in their homes, for five minutes in three different situations. Mother and child were first put in a room with a standard set of toys, to represent a control play. In the second situation, mother and child were allowed to play freely in an average toy room. In the third situation, the mother was asked to leave the room as if she had to check on something, like she would regularly do in their home environment, and then return. 

Depressed mothers are much less likely to use an affectionate tone while speaking to their infants. They have also been known to be much less vocally and facially expressive and use less infant-directed speech. Infant-directed speech also commonly referred to as, "motherese" or "parentese" (Bettes 1988) and is different than adult-directed speech in that a greatly exaggerated prosody is used and it elicits the infant's attention much more. (Kaplan, Bachorowski, Smoski, & Hudenko, 2002). Consequences of maternal depression on the infant may include learning difficulties because of the lack of infant directed speech.<ref> Sara L. Sohr-Preston1 and Laura V. Scaramella. "Implications of Timing of Maternal Depressive Symptoms for Early Cognitive and Language Development." Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review, Vol. 9, No. 1, March 2006  </ref>

Senior psychologists then scored the interaction between mother and child. The first two taped situations were scored on a five point scale; 1 (being the area of most concern) to 5 (being an area of strength). In the third situation, the attachment behavior was put into three groups based on how the child reacted to the mother's return.  

<blockquote>'''Three classified groups:'''

* '''''Secure and joyful attachment''''': consists of child greeting mother with joy and being comforted by her presence.
* '''''Secure attachment but restricted in expressed enjoyment and pleasure''''': consists of the child acknowledging the mother, but showing less joy than would normally be expected.
*'''''Insecure attachment''''': consists of child showing signs of avoidance and resistance. In the form of resistance the child would go to the mother, but then pull away and often repeat this action.</blockquote>

Analysis showed only one difference between the groups. In the free play situation, children of mothers with high EPDS scores showed less interest in playing with their mothers and exploring on their own, than the children of mothers with low EPDS scores. The mothers too, only showed one difference. Those with a high EDPS score showed little maternal emotional availability to the child.

Following the results, Edhborg performed a cluster analysis, keeping interest on the different interaction styles. Some children did show signs of depression, but when comparing the children it was found that there is no significance with the EPDS scores and the interaction styles. The study did find, however, that children of high EPDS scorers were less involved in the free play situation than the children of low EPDS scorers, showing that children of high EPDS are more likely to be insecure.

When performing the structured task from the first situation it showed that the mothers with high EPDS were "aware of their unavailability for the child in the early postpartum period and thus tried harder… to help their children succeed in the task" (Edhborg). This overreaction proves that too much interaction can cause a negative mood in the child and a continuing difficulty in mother-child communication.

Attachment issues have been shown to be a problem in older children, also. As a result of being exposed to the depression symptoms, as an infant, older children may have impaired cognitive and socio-emotional developments. The lack of attachment can also cause troubles in the interaction with others and personal independence (Long-term). Children with these issues have a higher risk of being diagnosed with depression later in life as well (Honey).

John Bowlby's attachment theory explains how infants learn about their environment while keeping their caregiver close. Bowlby explains his theories with the principles of variety, heredity, and natural selection. Children need balance between the outside world and the love and support of their parents. Bowlby concentrates on a child's instinct and human nature, in opposition of Locke who believes that a newborn has no instinct to direct him or her. (Chasse, J.)

==Prevention==
Early identification and intervention improves long term prognoses for most women. Some success with preemptive treatment has been found as well. A major part of prevention is being informed about the risk factors, and the medical community can play a key role in identifying and treating postpartum depression. Women should be screened by their physician to determine their risk for acquiring postpartum depression. Also, proper exercise and nutrition appears to play a role in preventing postpartum, and general, depression.

In the US, the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] recommends that the first prenatal visit include screening for depression, stress, support, and whether the pregnancy was planned.<ref name=ahrq2011>{{cite journal|title=Providers miss opportunities to prevent depression in and discuss birth control with women with unplanned pregnancies | url=http://www.ahrq.gov/research/aug11/0811RA18.htm | journal = Research Activities | date = August 2011 | page = 15 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | issue = 372}}</ref> However providers do not consistently provide screening and appropriate follow-up.<ref name=ahrq2011 />

Currently, Alberta is the only province in Canada with universal PPD screening which has been in place since 2003. The PPD screening is carried out by Public Health nurses in conjunction with the baby's immunization schedule.

In an examination of data from 10,700 children (born in 2001 and followed until 2007) from the [[U.S. Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Birth Cohort]], it was determined that children of mothers suffering from persistent PPD are more likely to be very short at ages 4 and 5 (at or below the 10th percentile for height at those two ages).<ref>http://healthyliving.msn.com/pregnancy-parenting/kids-health/postpartum-depression-may-lead-to-shorter-kids-study-1</ref> Therefore, infants and young children (especially children not born to short parents) born to mothers with PPD, especially severe and/or long-lasting PPD, might do well to be evaluated more closely, at least for height, during any periodic physical examinations and other health evaluation (well-child) visits.   

=== Nutrition ===
Pregnant, nursing and postpartum women are strongly encouraged to seek the medical advice of their [[obstetrician]], [[primary care physician]], [[registered dietitian]], or midwife regarding optimal nutrition during pregnancy and after birth.

The following nutritional information may be beneficial in achieving a well-balanced diet during and after pregnancy, but studies are needed to confirm their role in preventing postpartum depression.

'''[[Omega-3 fatty acids]]''': Some experts believe that postpartum depression can be attributed to depletion of [[omega-3 fatty acids|omega 3 fatty acids]] from the mother's brain to support development of the brain of the fetus or breast fed infant.  This can be prevented by ensuring that sufficient omega 3 fatty acids are provided in the mother's diet.<ref name=fda2004>{{cite web
 |publisher=obgyn.net

 |title=Pregnant/Nursing Women Need Proper Fat Intake to Combat Depression
 |accessdate=2008-07-04
 }}</ref>  Good natural sources of omega 3 fatty acids include edible linseed oil, certain fish, grass fed rather than grain fed meat, and eggs from chickens fed on flax seed or other feed high in omega 3 fats.  Omega 3 fatty acids can also be purchased in capsule form as a dietary supplement.

'''[[Protein]]''' can be found in a wide variety of foods. Some examples follow: 3 ounces of most meat products contain 25&nbsp;grams of protein, 3 large eggs have approximately 19&nbsp;grams, and 3 ounces of Swiss cheese have about 15&nbsp;grams.
	
'''[[Rehydration|Hydration]]''': One of the most important roles in any diet (especially for pregnant and nursing mothers) is that of hydration. Physicians may recommend that pregnant women consume ten 8-ounce glasses of water every day. Mothers who are nursing are strongly urged to drink a tall glass of water, milk or juice before sitting down to breastfeed their child. Women should consult with their physicians about caffeine and alcohol consumption postpartum.
	
'''[[Vitamins]]''': A pregnant and postpartum woman should speak with her physician for information about, and a recommendation for, a daily prenatal/postnatal [[vitamin]] supplement.

'''[[B Vitamins]]''' Some limited research has indicated that the intake of B vitamins, specifically [[riboflavin]], can help reduce the chance of post partum depression.<ref>[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=18217921 The Osaka Maternal and Child Health Study]</ref> [[B vitamins]] are water soluble and must be replenished each day.

'''[[Appetite]]''': If a woman finds herself with a loss of [[appetite]] or other eating disturbance, she should consult her physician. This may be a sign of postpartum depression and therefore should be discussed with a doctor.<ref name="OBOS" />

==Treatment==
Numerous scientific studies and scholarly journal articles support the notion that postpartum depression is treatable using a variety of methods. If the cause of PPD can be identified, as described above under "social risk factors," treatment should be aimed at mitigating the root cause of the problem, including increased partner support, additional help with childcare, cognitive therapy, etc. Non-professional interventions can be effective.<ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001134.pub3/abstract</ref><ref>http://www.thementalelf.net/mental-health-conditions/depression/psychosocial-and-psychological-interventions-can-prevent-postpartum-depression-says-new-cochrane-review/</ref>

Women need to be taken seriously when symptoms occur. This is a twofold practice: First, the postpartum woman will want to trust her intuition about how she is feeling and believe that her symptoms are real enough to tell her significant other, a close friend, and/or her medical practitioner; erring on the side of caution will go a long way in the treatment of PPD.<ref name="OBOS" /> Second, the people in whom she confides must take her symptoms seriously as well, aiding her with treatment and support. Partners, friends and physicians may notice changes in a postpartum mother that she may not. Knowing that PPD is treatable with a variety of methods can make persistence in seeking treatment easier.

Various treatment options include:
* Medical evaluation to rule out physiological problems
* [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (a form of [[psychotherapy]])
* Possible medication
* Support groups
* Home visits/Home visitors
* Healthy diet
* Consistent/healthy sleep patterns

An experienced medical professional will work ''with'' a postpartum mother to develop a treatment plan that is right for her. This plan may include any combination of the above options, and might include some discussion or feedback from/with a partner. If a woman suffering from PPD does not feel she is being taken seriously or is being recommended a treatment plan she does not feel comfortable with, she will want to seek a second opinion.<ref name="OBOS" />

A 1997 study conducted by Appleby ''et al.'', confirms that postpartum depressed mothers’ symptoms promptly improved at similar rates when treated with cognitive behavioral therapy or the antidepressant [[fluoxetine]]. "A group of 61 depressed mothers completed a 12-week treatment program with or without the antidepressant plus one session versus six sessions of counseling." Improvement followed after "one to four weeks of either treatment."<ref name="Appleby">{{cite journal | author = Appleby, Louis, Rachel Warner, Brian Faragher, and Anna Whitton | title = A Controlled Study of Fluoxetine and Cognitive-Behavioural Counseling in the Treatment of Postnatal Depression | journal = British Medical Journal | pages = 932–937 | id = 314.n7085 }}</ref> The findings of Appleby et al.’s study conclusively showed that combining counseling with drug therapy ''did not'' add to the improvement of just drug therapy or just counseling.<ref name="Appleby" /> This suggests that counseling is equally as effective a treatment for PPD as medication, and that "the choice of treatment [psychotherapy vs. medication] may…be made by the women themselves".<ref name="Appleby" /> Other forms of therapy (like group therapy and home visitors) are also effective treatments for PPD.<ref name="OBOS" />

A woman will want to discuss the various treatment options available with her physician and, if considering drug therapy, should speak about which medications are safe to take while [[breastfeeding]].

Treatment for PPD can reduce the length of suffering and its severity. Untreated, the Baby Blues may go away on its own (and does in most cases). PPD may or may not go away without treatment. Speaking to a health care provider as soon as symptoms occur is the safest way to ensure prompt treatment and return to normal life.

According to The National Institutes of Mental Health, studies show that the childbearing years are when a woman is most likely to experience depression in her lifetime. Approximately 15% of all women will experience postpartum depression following the birth of a child. (Chasse, J). When the mental health of the mother is compromised, it affects the entire family. (Postpartum Support International).

== Cross-culture ==
Postpartum depression and illnesses similar to it are found across the globe, with rates of incidence varying from 11% to 42%.<ref> Ali, Niloufer S., Badar S. Ali, and Iqbal S. Azam. "Post partum anxiety and depression in peri-urban communities of Karachi, Pakistan: a quasi-experimental study."  BMC Public Health.  9:384 (2009). Web </ref>

The Malay culture holds a belief in a spirit known as Hantu Meroyan that resides in the placenta and amniotic fluid. When this spirit is unsatisfied and venting resentment, it causes the mother to experience frequent crying, loss of appetite, and trouble sleeping, known collectively as "sakit meroyan." The mother can be cured with the help of a shaman, who performs a séance to force the spirits to leave.<ref name=-2009>{{cite journal

In addition, the new mother is not allowed to bathe, wash her hair, leave the house, or be blown by the wind.<ref name=-200903>{{cite journal

== Psychosis ==

{{Main|Postpartum psychosis}}

'''Postpartum psychosis''' is a separate mental health disorder which is sometimes erroneously referred to as postpartum depression. It is less common than PPD, and it involves the onset of [[psychotic]] symptoms that may include thought disturbances, delusions, hallucinations and/or disorganized speech or behavior. The prevalence of postpartum psychosis in the general population is 1—2 per 1,000 childbirths, however the rate is 100 times higher in women with bipolar disorder or a previous history of postpartum psychosis. Bipolar disorder and, to a lesser extent, schizophrenia have elevated prevalences in postpartum psychosis.<ref name=-200904>{{cite journal

Previous research looked at the relationship between childbirth and postpartum psychosis. Using data on 54,000 births over a 12-year period, researchers found that psychiatric admissions were seven times more likely in the first 30 days after childbirth than in the prepregnancy period and among patients who developed postpartum psychosis after childbirth, 72%—80% had bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder and 12% had schizophrenia. Indicators of a possible bipolar diagnosis include a history of missed or misdiagnosed mood episodes, any previous mania or hypomania, and a family history of bipolar disorder or postpartum psychosis.<ref name=-200904/>

Treatment for Postnatal Psychosis is essential; it will not go away without medical attention.<ref name="OBOS" />
