The '''Medical Protection Society''' (MPS) is a not for profit organisation which offers [[legal]] and [[ethical]] help to [[physician|medical]] and [[dentistry|dental]] (through its subsidiary company Dental Protection Ltd.) professionals. Based in the [[United Kingdom]], it operates in over 40 countries (including [[Ireland]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[South Africa]], [[New Zealand]] plus the [[Caribbean]] and [[Bermuda]]) and has over 280,000 members worldwide.

The MPS was founded in 1892, with just 13 original members all practising in the [[home counties]] of [[England]], and now (2013) has over 280,000 members worldwide. The other two organisations in the same field in the UK are the [[Medical Defence Union]] (MDU) and the [[Medical and Dental Defence Union of Scotland]] (MDDUS).

==Indemnity==

MPS aims to help doctors with ethical and legal problems that arise from their clinical practice. Members of the MPS look to the organisation for medicolegal advice and [[indemnity|indemnification]] for the legal costs in defence of their professional reputations. MPS also pays out damages for [[Medical malpractice|clinical negligence]]. However, it is not an [[insurance company]]; MPS offers funds and other services to its membership body at the discretion of a council of representative members.<ref>{{cite web |title=Medical Protection Society Company Description |url=http://www.hoovers.com/medical-protection-society/--ID__135232--/free-co-profile.xhtml |publisher=Hoover's |accessdate=2008-03-24}}</ref>
