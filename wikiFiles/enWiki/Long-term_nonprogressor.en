'''Long-term nonprogressors''' (LTNPs), less commonly called '''elite controllers''', are rare individuals who are infected with [[HIV]], but control the infection without antiretroviral therapy. Many of these patients have been HIV positive for 30 years without progressing to the point of needing to take medication in order not to develop AIDS.  {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} They have been the subject of a great deal of research, since an understanding of their ability to control HIV infection may lead to the development of immune therapies or a therapeutic vaccine.<ref>''Understanding Long-term Nonprogressors.''

It is estimated that around 1 in 500 people with HIV are long-term nonprogressors.<ref>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, http://www.niaid.nih.gov/volunteer/hivlongterm/Pages/default.aspx, accessed July 5, 2011</ref> Without the symptoms of AIDS, many LTNP patients may not know they are infected.<ref>Walker BD. ''Elite control of HIV Infection: implications for vaccines and treatment.'' Top HIV Med. 2007 Aug-Sep;15(4):134-6. PMID 17720999</ref> The clinical relevance of the classification "Long-term non-progressor" is not definitive because some patients classified in this category have gone on to develop AIDS. It is likely, however, that these patients were not true LTNP patients.

[[Genetic trait]]s that confer greater resistance or more robust immune response to HIV are thought to explain why LTNP patients progress to the point of needing to take medication in order not to develop AIDS more slowly than most HIV-infected people.<ref>{{Cite pmid|19837464}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid|19733595}}</ref> Some LTNP are infected with a weakened or inactive form of HIV, but it is now known that many LTNP patients carry a fully virulent form of the virus. Genetic traits that may affect progression include:

* '''Gene mutation.''' A mutation in the [[FUT2]] gene affects the progression of HIV-1 infection.<ref name="journals.lww.com">http://journals.lww.com/aidsonline/Fulltext/2006/03210/A_nonsense_mutation__428G__A__in_the.7.aspx</ref> 20% of Europeans who have that mutation are called "non secretor" because of their absence of a certain type of antigen that provide also a strong resistance against [[norovirus]]<ref name="journals.lww.com"/><ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1315998/?tool=pubmed</ref>

* '''Mitochondrial DNA.''' Different types of [[Mitochondrial DNA]] in humans gives an increased or a decreased rate of HIV progression.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699618/</ref>

* '''Receptor mutations.''' A low percentage of long-term nonprogressors have been shown to have inherited mutations of the [[CCR5]] receptor of [[T cell]] [[lymphocyte]]s.  HIV uses CCR5 to enter these cells.  It is believed that the [[CCR5#CCR5-.CE.9432|Δ32 (delta 32) variant]] of CCR5 impairs HIV ability to infect cells and cause disease.  An understanding of this mechanism led to the development of a class of HIV medicines, the [[entry inhibitors]].<ref>Olivier Lambotte, Faroudy Boufassa, Yoann Madec, Ahn Nguyen, et al. ''HIV controllers: a homogeneous group of HIV-1-infected patients with spontaneous control of viral replication.'' Clinical Infectious Diseases. Chicago: Oct 1, 2005. Vol. 41, Iss. 7; pg. 1053 PMID 16142675</ref> The presence of this mutation, however, is not a unifying theme among LTNPs and is observed in a exceedingly small number of these patients.

* [[HLA type]] has also been correlated with long-term non-progressor cohorts. In particular, a high percentage of people possessing HLA-B*5705 and/or HLA-B*2705 are more likely to exhibit control over HIV (Migueles ''et al.'', 2000).

* '''Antibody production.''' All individuals with HIV make [[antibodies]] against the virus. In most patients, broadly neutralizing antibodies do not emerge until ~4 years after the initial infection. At this point, the latent reservoir has already been established and the presence of broadly neutralizing antibodies is not enough to prevent disease progression. In some rare patients, these antibodies emerge earlier and can result in a delayed disease course. These patients, however, are not typically classified as LTNPs, but rather as slow progressors, who will eventually develop AIDS. Induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies in healthy individuals is a potential strategy for a preventive HIV vaccine.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
