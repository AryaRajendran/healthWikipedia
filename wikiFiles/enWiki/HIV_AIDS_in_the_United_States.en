As the knowledge that [[men who have sex with men|men who had sex with men]] were dying of an otherwise rare cancer began to spread throughout the medical communities, the syndrome began to be called by the colloquialism "gay cancer."  As medical scientists discovered that the syndrome included other manifestations, such as [[pneumocystis carinii pneumonia|pneumocystis pneumonia]], (PCP), a rare form of [[fungal pneumonia]], its name was changed to  "GRID," or ''[[Gay related immune deficiency|Gay Related Immune Deficiency]]''.<ref name="Altman 1982">{{Cite news

Within the medical community, it quickly became apparent that the disease was not specific to men who have sex with men (as [[blood transfusion]] patients, [[intravenous drug]] users, [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] women, and newborn babies became added to the list of afflicted), and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) renamed the syndrome [[AIDS]] (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) in 1982. [[Hemophiliacs]], who require injections of blood clotting factor as a course of treatment, during the late 1970s and 1980s also contracted HIV in large numbers worldwide through the spread of [[Contaminated haemophilia blood products|contaminated blood products]]. It is estimated that nearly 1 million individuals are currently infected with HIV in the country, and the number appears to be increasing each year.

Male to male sexual contact accounted for about half of new cases, and intravenous drug use contributed about a fifth of cases.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/us.htm</ref> Despite the availability of [[Needle-exchange programme|syringe access programs]], many individuals continue to share and use dirty or infected needles in most American cities.<ref name="pmid19602236">{{cite journal

In addition, the percentage of AIDS diagnoses in the United States in 2007 can be spatially analyzed.  There is a higher percentage of AIDS diagnoses in the Eastern and in the Southern most states.  The states with similar data figures tend to be clustered together with a few exceptions such as Illinois and Nevada.  With the provided data, it can be concluded that the majority of the AIDS diagnoses can be found near coastal areas.  It is a fair to state that these coastal areas have a higher population density, which could result in a higher distribution rate of the disease.  In other words, areas with the greatest population density tend to transmit the disease more rapidly.  In contrast, in less populated areas, the disease is more likely to be localized in a contained area and is not widespread.  Also, these areas are harbor areas where various people and cultures make their way into the United States and vice versa.  The risk of the high interaction between the U.S. and other countries is that people become more susceptible to disease contraction and transmissions.<ref>http://www.avert.org/his81_86.htm</ref>

== Public perception ==
Regarding the social effects of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, there has been since the 1980s a "profound re-[[medicalization]] of [[human sexuality|sexuality]]".<ref name="Aggleton et al 2000">{{cite book |author=Aggleton, Peter; Parker, Richard Bordeaux; Barbosa, Regina Maria |title=Framing the sexual subject: the politics of gender, sexuality, and power |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-520-21838-8 |oclc= |doi=|page=3}}</ref><ref name="pmid1745914">{{cite journal

One of the best-known works on the history of HIV is 1987's book ''[[And the Band Played On]]'', by [[Randy Shilts]]. Shilts contends that [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration dragged its feet in dealing with the crisis due to homophobia, while the gay community viewed early reports and public health measures with corresponding distrust, thus allowing the disease to spread and hundreds of thousands of people to needlessly die. This resulted in the formation of ACT-UP, the [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] by [[Larry Kramer]]. 

This work popularized the [[HIV and AIDS misconceptions|misconception]] that the disease was introduced by a gay  [[flight attendant]] named [[Gaëtan Dugas]], referred to as "[[Index case|Patient Zero]]." However, subsequent research has revealed that there were cases of AIDS much earlier than initially known. HIV-infected blood samples have been found from as early as 1959 in Africa ''(see [[HIV]] main entry)'', and HIV has been shown to have caused the death of a sexually active 16 year old St. Louis male prostitute in 1969, who could have contracted it as early as 7 years old due to sexual abuse, raising the question of spontaneous random genesis.<ref name="pmid11367253">{{cite journal

Shilts also details the fact that despite recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control, the [[Red Cross]] and other non-profits, blood banking organizations refused to ban bisexual and gay men from donating blood in an effort to keep the blood bank industry from suffering shortages, particularly in cities having large homosexual communities; many of the same cities where AIDS was first discovered in. As a result, tens of thousands of hemophiliacs and [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] recipients were infected and died. 

It has been theorized that a series of [[inoculation]]s against [[hepatitis]] that were performed in the gay community of [[San Francisco]] were tainted with HIV. Although there was a high correlation between recipients of that [[vaccination]] and initial cases of AIDS, this theory has never been proven. HIV, [[hepatitis B]], and [[hepatitis C]] are bloodborne diseases with very similar modes of transmission, and those at risk for one are at risk for the others.<ref name="NIOSH Bloodborne">{{Cite web

Activists and critics of current AIDS policies allege that another preventable impediment to the attack on the disease was the [[academic elitism]] of "celebrity" scientists. [[Robert Gallo]], an American scientist who was one of many to attempt to figure out if there was some kind of new [[virus]] in the people who were affected by the disease, became embroiled in a legal battle with French scientist [[Luc Montagnier]]. Gallo, too, appeared hung up on the possible connection between the virus causing AIDS and [[HTLV]], a [[retrovirus]] that he had worked with previously. Critics claim that because some scientists (and biological research companies) wanted glory and fame (and lucrative patent rights), research progress was delayed and more people needlessly died. Eventually, after meeting, the French scientists and Gallo agreed to "share" the discovery of HIV. 

Publicity campaigns were started in attempts to counter the often vitriolic and homophobic perception of AIDS as a "gay plague." In particular this included the [[Ryan White]] case, red ribbon campaigns, celebrity dinners, the [[And the Band Played On (film)|1993 film version]] of ''And the Band Played On'', sex education programs in schools, and television advertisements. Announcements by various celebrities that they had contracted HIV (including actor [[Rock Hudson]], basketball star [[Magic Johnson]], tennis player [[Arthur Ashe]] and singer [[Freddie Mercury]]) were significant in making the general public aware of the dangers of the disease to people of all sexual orientations.

Great progress was made in the U.S. following the introduction of three-drug anti-HIV treatments ("cocktails") that included [[protease inhibitors]]. [[David Ho (scientist)|David Ho]], a pioneer of this approach, was honored as ''[[Time Magazine]]'' Man of the Year for 1996. Deaths were rapidly reduced by more than half, with a small but welcome reduction in the yearly rate of new HIV infections. Since this time, AIDS deaths have continued to decline, but much more slowly, and not as completely in black Americans as in other population segments.<ref name="Left Behind Black America">{{Cite web

=== Travel restrictions ===
The second prong of the American approach to containment has been to maintain strict entry controls to the country for people with HIV or AIDS. Under legislation enacted by the [[United States Congress]] in 1993, patients found importing anti-HIV medication into the country were arrested and placed on flights back to their country of origin.

Some HIV-positive travellers took to sending anti-HIV medication through the post to friends or contacts in advocacy groups in advance. This meant that the traveller would not be discovered with any medication. However, the security clampdown following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 meant this was no longer an option.

The only legal alternative to this was to apply for a special [[Visa (document)|visa]] beforehand, which entailed interview at an American Embassy, confiscation of the passport during the lengthy application process, and then, if permission were granted, a permanent attachment being made to the applicant's passport.

This process was condemned as intrusive and invasive by a number of advocacy groups, on the grounds that any time the passport was later used for travel elsewhere or for identification purposes, the holder's HIV status would become known. It was also felt that this rule was unfair because it applied even if the traveller was covered for HIV-related conditions under their own travel [[insurance]].

In early December 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] indicated that he would issue an executive order allowing HIV-positive people to enter the [[United States]] on standard visas. It is unclear whether applicants will still have to declare their HIV status.<ref name="Russell 2006">{{Cite news

In August 2007, Congressperson [[Barbara Lee]] of California introduced {{USBill|110|h|3337}}, the HIV Nondiscrimination in Travel and Immigration Act of 2007. This bill would allow travelers and immigrants entry to the United States without having to disclose their HIV status. The bill died at the end of the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]]. In July 2008, then President George W. Bush signed {{USBill|110|h|5501}} that lifted the ban in statutory law. However, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] still held the ban in administrative (written regulation) law. New impetus was added to repeal efforts when Paul Thorn, a UK tuberculosis expert who was invited to speak at the 2009 [[Pacific Health Summit]] in Seattle, was denied a visa due to his HIV positive status. A letter written by Mr. Thorn, and read in his place at the Summit, was attained by Congressman [[Jim McDermott]], who advocated the issue to the Obama administration's Health Secretary.<ref>| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8136456.stm | title = Activist helps US HIV law change | publisher = BBC News | accessdate = January 9, 2012</ref>

=== Medicine disbursement ===
Previously in the U.S., HIV drugs were only given to those who had T-cell counts of under 200, but that had been boosted in the mid 2000's to 350 on advice from the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] (JAMA) guidelines which recommend therapy for all patients at 350 or certain patients higher. For the uninsured, there are generally two funding sources, Medicaid and [[AIDS Drug Assistance Programs]] (ADAP), both administered differently in each state but still consistent with federal requirements established by the [[Ryan White Care Act]].

According to a recent large scale study, asymptomatic HIV positive patients who started on medication with T-cell counts 350 to 500 had a 70 percent higher survival rate than those who waited.  The results from this shows that waiting even until the cell count reaches 350 (current JAMA recommendation) increases the risk of death, let alone the Medicaid eligible 200.<ref name="Medpagetoday">{{Cite web

== Mortality and morbidity ==
Invariably, HIV is a silent disease when first acquired, and this period of latency varies. Current estimates indicate that close to half a million individuals have died of AIDS in the USA. The progression from HIV infection to AIDS varies from 5–12 years. In the past, most individuals succumbed to the disease in 1–2 years after being diagnosed with AIDS. However, since the introduction of potent anti retroviral drug therapy and better [[Post-exposure prophylaxis|prophylaxis]] against opportunistic infections, [[mortality rate|death rates]] have significantly declined.<ref name="SFDPH HIV Epi Report 2008">{{Cite web

From its male, same-sex beginnings, AIDS continues to be a problem with illegal sex workers and intravenous drug users. Today, the main route of transmission for women is through heterosexual sex, and the main risk factor for them is non-protection and the undisclosed risky behavior of their sexual partners. Experts attribute this to "AIDS fatigue" among younger people who have no memory of the worst phase of the epidemic in the 1980s and early 1990s, as well as "[[condom fatigue]]" among those who have grown tired of and disillusioned with the unrelenting [[safer sex]] message.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} This trend is of major concern to public health workers.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

AIDS is one of the top three causes of death for [[African American]] men aged 25–54 and for African American women aged 35–44 years in the United States of America.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} In the United States, African Americans make up about 47% of the total HIV-positive population and more than half of new HIV cases, despite making up only 12% of the population.<ref>http://www.nccu.edu/research/osrp/documents/ResearchBrochure.pdf</ref> African American women are 19 times more likely to have HIV than white women.<ref>UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic 2010 (p 50)</ref>

In a 2008 study, the Center for Disease Control found that, of the study participants who were men who had sex with men ("MSM"), almost one in five (19%) had HIV and "among those who were infected, nearly half (44 percent) were unaware of their HIV status." The research found that those who are white MSM "represent a greater number of new HIV infections than any other population, followed closely by black MSM — who are one of the most disproportionately affected subgroups in the U.S." and that most new infections among white MSM occurred among those aged 30–39 followed closely by those aged 40–49, while most new infections among black MSM have occurred among young black MSM (aged 13–29).<ref name="2010sept_cdc">[http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/.../docs/FastFacts-MSM-FINAL508COMP.pdf CDC Fact Sheet - HIV and AIDS among Gay and Bisexual Men - Sept 2010]</ref><ref name="kaiser_2010gaymale_hiv">[http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Daily-Reports/2010/September/24/AIDS-gay-men.aspx  CDC: One In Five Gay Men HIV-Positive]</ref>
