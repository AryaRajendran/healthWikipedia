'''Elephantiasis''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|l|ɨ|f|ən|ˈ|t|aɪ|.|ə|s|ɨ|s}} {{respell|EL|i-fən|TY|ə-sis}} is a disease that is characterized by the thickening of the skin and underlying tissues, especially in the legs and male genitals. In some cases the disease can cause certain body parts, such as the [[scrotum]], to swell to the size of a [[basketball (ball)|basketball]].<ref name="NYT">{{cite news | last=McNeil| first=Donald | title=Beyond Swollen Limbs, a Disease's Hidden Agony |journal=New York Times|date=2006-04-09 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/09/world/americas/09lymph.html |accessdate=2008-07-17 |work=The New York Times}}</ref>  It is caused by [[filariasis]] or [[podoconiosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Gail |last=Davey |year=2008 |title=Podoconiosis: let Ethiopia lead the way |journal=The Ethiopian Journal of  Health Development |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1–2 |url=http://ejhd.uib.no/ejhd-v22-n1/1%20Podoconiosis%20let%20Ethiopia%20lead%20the%20way.pdf}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Elephantiasis leads to marked swelling of the lower half of the body.

==Causes==
Elephantiasis occurs in the presence of microscopic, thread-like parasitic worms such as ''[[Wuchereria bancrofti]]'', ''[[Brugia malayi]]'', and ''[[Brugia timori|B. timori]]'', all of which are transmitted by [[mosquito]]es.<ref name= CDC>{{cite web
| title=Lymphatic Filariasis | author= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. | year=2008 | url=http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/lymphaticfilariasis/index.html |accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref> However, the disease itself is a result of a complex interplay between several factors: the worm, the symbiotic ''[[Wolbachia]]'' bacteria within the worm, the host’s immune response, and the numerous opportunistic infections and disorders that arise. Consequently, it is common in tropical regions and [[Africa]].  The adult worms only live in the human [[lymphatic system]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Niwa |first=Seiji |title=Prevalence of Vizcarrondo worms in early onset lymphatic filariasis: A case study in testicular elephantiasis |journal=Univ Puerto Rico Med J |volume=22 |pages=187&ndash;193}}{{Verify source|can't find this source. is all the bibliographic info correct?|date=November 2011}}</ref> The parasite infects the lymph nodes and blocks the flow of lymph throughout the body; this results in chronic [[edema]], most often noted in the lower torso (typically in the legs and genitals). <ref>{{cite book|last=Saladin|first=Kenneth|title=Anatomy & Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function|year=2007|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-287506-5}}</ref>

Alternatively, elephantiasis may occur in the absence of parasitic infection. This nonparasitic form of elephantiasis is known as "nonfilarial elephantiasis" or "podoconiosis", and areas of high prevalence have been documented in [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Sudan]], [[Egypt]] and [[Ethiopia]].<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1175–80 |doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2007.08.013 |title=Podoconiosis: Non-infectious geochemical elephantiasis |year=2007 |last1=Davey |first1=Gail |last2=Tekola |first2=Fasil |last3=Newport |first3=Melanie J. |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene |volume=101 |issue=12 |pmid=17976670}}</ref> The worst affected area is Ethiopia, where up to 6% of the population is affected in endemic areas.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10214438 |year=1997 |last1=Birrie |first1=H |last2=Balcha |first2=F |last3=Jemaneh |first3=L |title=Elephantiasis in Pawe settlement area: Podoconiosis or bancroftian filariasis? |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=245–50 |journal=Ethiopian medical journal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=14620426 |year=2003 |last1=Destas |first1=K |last2=Ashine |first2=M |last3=Davey |first3=G |title=Prevalence of podoconiosis (endemic non-filarial elephantiasis) in Wolaitta, Southern Ethiopia |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=217–20 |journal=Tropical doctor}}</ref> Nonfilarial elephantiasis is thought to be caused by persistent contact with irritant soils: in particular, red clays rich in alkali metals such as [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] and associated with volcanic activity.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=4439458 |year=1974 |last1=Price |first1=EW |title=The relationship between endemic elephantiasis of the lower legs and the local soils and climate |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=225–30 |journal=Tropical and geographical medicine}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pages=288–95 |doi=10.1016/0035-9203(76)90078-X |title=The association of endemic elephantiasis of the lower legs in East Africa with soil derived from volcanic rocks |year=1976 |last1=Price |first1=E.W. |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene |volume=70 |issue=4 |pmid=1006757}}</ref>

=== Prevention ===
[[File:Malphileriabanner.JPG|thumb|A banner from the [[India]]n state of [[Kerala]] which directs people to take ''Albendazole'' tablets as a preventive measure against elephantiasis]]
According to medical experts the worldwide efforts to eliminate lymphatic filariasis is on track to potentially be successful by 2020.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7659222.stm | work=BBC News | title='End in sight' for elephantiasis | date=October 8, 2008 | accessdate=March 29, 2010}}</ref>  An estimated 6.6 million children have been prevented from being infected, with another estimated 9.5 million in whom the progress of the disease has been stopped.

For podoconiosis, international awareness of the disease will have to rise before elimination is possible. In 2011, podoconiosis was added to the World Health Organization's [[Neglected diseases|Neglected Tropical Disease list]], which was an important milestone in raising global awareness of the condition.

==Treatment==
Treatments for lymphatic filariasis differ depending on the geographic location of the endemic area.<ref name="LFEP">{{Cite web | author= The Carter Center| title=Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Program|url=http://www.cartercenter.org/health/lf/index.html}}</ref> In [[Sub-Sahara Africa|sub-Saharan Africa]], [[albendazole]] is being used with [[ivermectin]] to treat the disease, whereas elsewhere in the world, albendazole is used with [[diethylcarbamazine]].<ref name="LFEP"/> Geo-targeting treatments is part of a larger [[Filariasis#Eradication_efforts|strategy]] to eventually eliminate lymphatic filariasis by 2020.<ref name="LFEP"/>

Another form of effective treatment involves rigorous cleaning of the affected areas of the body. Several studies have shown that these daily cleaning routines can be an effective way to limit the symptoms of lymphatic filariasis. The efficacy of these treatments suggests that many of the symptoms of elephantiasis are not directly a result of the lymphatic filariasis but rather the effect of secondary skin infections.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In addition, surgical treatment may be helpful for issues related to scrotal elephantiasis and [[hydrocele]]. However, surgery is generally ineffective at correcting elephantiasis of the limbs.

A [[vaccine]] is not yet available but is likely to be developed in the near future.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Treatment for podoconiosis consists of consistent shoe-wearing (to avoid contact with the irritant soil) and hygiene - daily soaking in water with an antiseptic (such as bleach) added, washing the feet and legs with soap and water, application of ointment, and in some cases, wearing elastic bandages.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Davey|first=Gail|coauthors=Burridge|title=Community-Based Control of a Neglected Tropical Disease: The Mossy Foot Treatment and Prevention Association|journal=PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases|date=26|year=2009|month=May|volume=3|issue=5|pages=6|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000424|url=http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0000424|accessdate=1/25/12}}</ref> Antibiotics are used in cases of infection.

===Antibiotics===

In 2003 it was suggested that the common antibiotic [[doxycycline]] might be effective in treating lymphatic filariasis.<ref name="MedMicrobiolImmunol2003-Hoerauf">{{cite journal |pages=211–6 |doi=10.1007/s00430-002-0174-6 |title=Doxycycline as a novel strategy against bancroftian filariasis—depletion of Wolbachia endosymbionts from Wuchereria bancrofti and stop of microfilaria production  |year=2003 |last1=Hoerauf |first1=Achim |last2=Mand |first2=Sabine |last3=Fischer |first3=Kerstin |last4=Kruppa |first4=Thomas |last5=Marfo-Debrekyei |first5=Yeboah |last6=Debrah |first6=Alexander Yaw |last7=Pfarr |first7=Kenneth M. |last8=Adjei |first8=Ohene |last9=Büttner |first9=Dietrich W. |journal=Medical Microbiology and Immunology |volume=192 |issue=4 |pmid=12684759}}</ref> The parasites responsible for elephantiasis have a population of symbiotic bacteria, ''[[Wolbachia]]'', that live inside the worm. When the symbiotic bacteria are killed by the antibiotic, the worms themselves also die.

Clinical trials by the [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]] in June 2005 reported that an 8 week course almost completely eliminated microfilariaemia.<ref name="Lancet2005-Taylor">{{cite journal |pages=2116–21 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66591-9 |laysummary=http://www.jyi.org/news/nb.php?id=361 |laysource=The Journal of Young Investigators |laydate=November 2011 |title=Macrofilaricidal activity after doxycycline treatment of Wuchereria bancrofti: A double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial |year=2005 |last1=Taylor |first1=Mark J |last2=Makunde |first2=Williams H |last3=McGarry |first3=Helen F |last4=Turner |first4=Joseph D |last5=Mand |first5=Sabine |last6=Hoerauf |first6=Achim |journal=The Lancet |volume=365 |issue=9477 |pmid=15964448}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Lymphatic filariasis affects over 120 million people, primarily in Africa and South-East Asia, with about 40 million disfigured and incapacitated by the disease.<ref>"[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs102/en/ Lymphatic filariasis]". World Health Organization (WHO)</ref>

==History==
{{cquote|Many people in [[Zamorin|Malabar]], Nayars as well as Brahmans and their wives — in fact about a quarter or a fifth of the total population, including the people of the lowest castes — have very large legs, swollen to a great size; and they die of this, and it is an ugly thing to see. They say that this is due to the water through which they go, because the country is marshy. This is called ''pericaes'' in the native language, and all the swelling is the same from the knees downward, and they have no pain, nor do they take any notice of this infirmity.|20x|20x|-[[Tomé Pires]], ''Suma Oriental'', 1512–1515.<ref>

==Society and culture==
===Impact on endemic communities===
Elephantiasis caused by lymphatic filariasis is one of the most common causes of disability in the world.<ref name="LFEP"/>  In endemic communities, approximately 10 percent of women can be affected with swollen limbs and 50 percent of men can suffer from mutilating genital disease.<ref name="LFEP"/>

In areas endemic for podoconiosis, prevalence can be 5% or higher.

==Research==
On September 20, 2007, [[geneticists]] mapped the [[genome]] or [[Genetics|genetic]] content of ''[[Brugia malayi]]'' - the [[roundworm]] which causes elephantiasis ([[lymphatic filariasis]]). Determining the content of the [[genes]] might lead to development of new [[drugs]] and [[vaccines]].<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1756–60 |doi=10.1126/science.1145406 |pmc=2613796 |title=Draft Genome of the Filarial Nematode Parasite Brugia malayi |year=2007 |last1=Ghedin |first1=E. |last2=Wang |first2=S. |last3=Spiro |first3=D. |last4=Caler |first4=E. |last5=Zhao |first5=Q. |last6=Crabtree |first6=J. |last7=Allen |first7=J.
