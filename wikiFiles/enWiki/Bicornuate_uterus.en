A '''bicornuate uterus''' or '''bicornate uterus''', commonly referred to as a "heart-shaped" uterus, is a type of [[uterine malformation]] where two "horns" form at the upper part of the uterus.

==Pathophysiology==
A bicornuate uterus is formed during [[embryogenesis]]. 
The fusion process of the upper part of the [[Müllerian ducts]] ([[Paramesonephric ducts]]) is altered. 
As a result the caudal part of the uterus is normal while the cephalo part is bifurcated.

==Classification==
There are many degrees of a bicornuate uterus.
There is a continuous range of the degree and location of the [[Müllerian ducts]] ([[Paramesonephric ducts]]) fusion and existence of a spectrum rather than a fixed number of types corresponding to strict medical definitions.
Two processes that occur during the embryonic development of the Müllerian ducts - fusion and reabsorption - can be affected to different degrees.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Acién P, Acién M, Sánchez-Ferrer ML |title=Müllerian anomalies "without a classification": from the didelphys-unicollis uterus to the bicervical uterus with or without septate vagina |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume= 91|issue= 6|pages= 2369–75|year=2008 |pmid=18367185 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.01.079 |url=}}</ref>
The degree can determine the likeliness of a pregnancy reaching full-term.

==Epidemiology==
The occurrence of all types of Müllerian duct abnormalities in women is estimated around 0.4%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Byrne J, Nussbaum-Blask A, Taylor WS, ''et al.'' |title=Prevalence of Müllerian duct anomalies detected at ultrasound |journal=Am. J. Med. Genet. |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=9–12 |year=2000  |pmid=10982475 |doi=10.1002/1096-8628(20000904)94:1<9::AID-AJMG3>3.0.CO;2-H |url=}}</ref>
A bicornuate uterus is estimated to occur in 0.1-0.5% of women in the U.S.
It is possible that this is an underestimate since subtle abnormalities often go undetected. Some intersex individuals who by the look of their external genitalia are legally registered as male may nonetheless have a variably shaped uterus.

==Effect on reproduction==
Pregnancies in a bicornuate uterus are usually considered high-risk and require extra monitoring because of association with poor reproduction potential.

A bicornuate uterus is associated with increased adverse reproductive outcomes like: 

* [[Recurrent pregnancy loss]]: the reproductive potential of a bicornuate uterus is usually measured by live birth rate (also called fetal survival rate).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rackow BW, Arici A |title=Reproductive performance of women with müllerian anomalies |journal=Curr. Opin. Obstet. Gynecol. |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=229–37 |year=2007 |pmid=17495638 |doi=10.1097/GCO.0b013e32814b0649 |url=}}</ref>
* [[Preterm birth]]: with a 15 to 25% rate of preterm delivery. The reason that a pregnancy may not reach full-term in a bicornuate uterus often happens when the baby begins to grow in either of the protrusions at the top. A short cervical length seems to be a good predicter of preterm delivery in women with a bicornuate uterus.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Airoldi J, Berghella V, Sehdev H, Ludmir J |title=Transvaginal ultrasonography of the cervix to predict preterm birth in women with uterine anomalies |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=106 |issue=3 |pages=553–6 |year=2005 |pmid=16135586 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000173987.59595.e2 |url=}}</ref>
* [[Malpresentation]] ([[breech birth]] or transverse presentation): a breech presentation occurs in 40-50% pregnancies with a partial bicornuate uterus and not at all (0%) in a complete bicornuate uterus.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heinonen PK, Saarikoski S, Pystynen P |title=Reproductive performance of women with uterine anomalies.

* [[Deformity]]: Offspring of mothers with a bicornuate uterus are at high risk for "deformities and disruptions" and "malformations."<ref>http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/101/4/e10.short</ref>

Previously, a bicornuate uterus was thought to be associated with infertility,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shuiqing M, Xuming B, Jinghe L |title=Pregnancy and its outcome in women with malformed uterus |journal=Chin. Med. Sci. J. |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=242–5 |year=2002 |pmid=12901513 |doi= |url=}}</ref> but recent studies have not confirmed such an association.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Proctor JA, Haney AF |title=Recurrent first trimester pregnancy loss is associated with uterine septum but not with bicornuate uterus |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=1212–5 |year=2003 |pmid=14607577 |doi= 10.1016/S0015-0282(03)01169-5|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015028203011695}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
It is possible to diagnose a bicornuate uterus using gynecologic sonography,<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Fertil Steril. 1987 Jan;47(1):89-93|title=Can ultrasound be used to screen uterine malformations?|author=Nicolini U, Bellotti M, Bonazzi B, Zamberletti D, Candiani GB}}</ref> specifically [[sonohysterography]], and [[MRI]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Marten K, Vosshenrich R, Funke M, Obenauer S, Baum F, Grabbe E |title=MRI in the evaluation of müllerian duct anomalies |journal=Clin Imaging |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=346–50 |year=2003 |pmid=12932688 |doi= 10.1016/S0899-7071(02)00587-9|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0899707102005879}}</ref> However, as there is no indication to do such procedures on asymptomatic women, the presence of a bicornuate uterus may not be detected until during pregnancy or delivery. 
In a C-section (usually done due to malpresentation) the irregular shape of the uterus can be noticed.

Other less reliable imaging methods include [[hysterosalpingography]] and [[hysteroscopy]]; these procedures are typically done during the course of an infertility investigation.
