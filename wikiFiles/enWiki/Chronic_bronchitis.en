'''Chronic bronchitis''' is a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[inflammation]] of the [[bronchus|bronchi]] (medium-size airways) in the [[lung]]s. It is generally considered one of the two forms of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), the other being [[emphysema]].<ref name="pmid17530508">{{cite journal |author=Shaker SB, Dirksen A, Bach KS, Mortensen J |title=Imaging in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |journal=COPD |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=143–61 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17530508 |doi=10.1080/15412550701341277 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&doi=10.1080/15412550701341277&magic=pubmed |unused_data=1B69BA326FFE69C3F0A8F227DF8201D0}}</ref> It is defined clinically as a persistent [[cough]] that produces [[sputum]] (phlegm) and mucus, for at least three months per year in two consecutive years.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|two/000014680|chronic bronchitis}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Bronchitis may be indicated by a [[cough]] that produces [[sputum]] (also known as a productive cough),
shortness of breath ([[dyspnea]]) and wheezing.
Occasionally [[chest pain]]s,
[[fever]], and
[[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] or [[malaise]] may also occur.
Mucus is often green or yellowish green and also may be orange or pink, depending on the pathogen causing the inflammation.

==Causes==
[[Tobacco smoking]] is the most common cause.<ref name=MedlinePlus>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/bronchitis.html MedlinePlus - Bronchitis]</ref> [[Pneumoconiosis]] and long-term fume inhalation are other causes.<ref name=MedlinePlus/>

==Pathophysiology==
Chronic bronchitis is caused by recurring injury or irritation to the [[respiratory epithelium]] of the [[bronchi]], resulting in chronic [[inflammation]] with infiltration of [[CD8+ T cells]], [[macrophages]], and [[neutrophils]],<ref name="Robbins">{{cite book|author=Kumar, Vinay|coauthors=Abul K.

==Diagnosis==
A [[physical examination]] will often reveal diminished breath sounds, wheezing and prolonged [[exhalation]].  Most doctors rely on the presence of a persistent dry or wet cough as evidence of bronchitis.

A variety of tests may be performed in patients presenting with cough and shortness of breath:
* Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT) (or [[spirometry]]) must be performed in all patients presenting with chronic cough. An [[FEV1]]/[[Forced vital capacity|FVC]] ratio below 0.7 that is not fully reversible after bronchodilator therapy indicates the presence of [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]], that requires more aggressive therapy and carries a more severe prognosis than simple chronic bronchitis.
* A [[chest X-ray]] that reveals hyperinflation; collapse and consolidation of lung areas would support a diagnosis of [[pneumonia]]. Some conditions that predispose to bronchitis may be indicated by chest radiography.
* A sputum sample showing [[neutrophil granulocyte]]s (inflammatory white blood cells) and [[microbiological culture|culture]] showing that has pathogenic microorganisms such as [[Streptococcus|Streptococcus spp.]]
* A [[blood test]] would indicate inflammation (as indicated by a raised [[white blood cell]] count and elevated [[C-reactive protein]]).
*[[Neutrophils]] infiltrate the lung tissue, aided by damage to the airways caused by irritation.
*Damage caused by irritation of the airways leads to inflammation and leads to neutrophils being present
*[[Mucosal]] hypersecretion is promoted by a substance released by neutrophils
*Further obstruction to the airways is caused by more goblet cells in the small airways. This is typical of chronic bronchitis
*Although infection is not the reason or cause of chronic bronchitis it is seen to aid in sustaining the bronchitis.
* High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) — This is a special type of CT scan that provides your doctor with high-resolution images of your lungs. Having a HRCT is no different than having a regular CT scan; they both are performed on an open-air table and take only a few minutes.

==Treatment==
[[Smoking cessation]] is of benefit as cigarette smoke paralyzes the [[cilia]] comprising the [[Respiratory_epithelium#Mucociliary_Escalator|mucociliary escalator]].

===Antibiotics===
Only about 5-10% of bronchitis cases are caused by a bacterial infection. Most cases of bronchitis are caused by a viral infection and are "[[Self-limiting (biology)|self-limited]]" and resolve themselves in a few weeks. For acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, if antibiotics are used, [[amoxicillin]] or [[doxycycline]] is recommended.<ref name="Cough">{{cite journal | author = Hueston WJ | title = Antibiotics: neither cost effective nor 'cough' effective | journal = The Journal of Family Practice | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 261–5 | year = 1997 | month = March | pmid = 9071245 | accessdate = 2009-06-30 }}</ref>

===Bronchodilators===
[[Ipratropium]] is a bronchodilator that may be useful for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as chronic bronchitis. [[Albuterol]] is also a common drug for this disease.

==Epidemiology==
In 2009, it was estimated that approximately 10 million Americans were diagnosed with chronic bronchitis by a [[physician]] with rates highest in the 18–44 year old age population. American women were diagnosed with chronic bronchitis at twice the rate as American men.<ref name="lung">{{cite web|url=http://www.lung.org/lung-disease/bronchitis-chronic/understanding-chronic-bronchitis.html |title=Understanding Chronic Bronchitis |author= |year=2012 |work= |publisher=American Lung Association |accessdate=30 December 2012}}

==History==
Dr. Charles Badham first distinguished bronchitis from other respiratory disorders in 1808. Before this distinction was made, early medical systems such as [[Ayurveda]], [[ancient Greek medicine]], and [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] proposed numerous hypotheses to explain pulmonary disease. The majority of these hypotheses centered on the premise that respiratory disease resulted from an imbalance in fundamental forces such as [[Qi]] or [[Humorism|the four humors]]. Treatments used to treat respiratory disease were varied and were often unrelated to the prevailing medical hypotheses and included: [[incense]] drugs, spices, herbs, certain foods, expectorants, and venesection ([[venipuncture]]). Modern pharmaceutical approaches to bronchitis expanded greatly in the twentieth century after pharmacologically active compounds demonstrated to have bronchodilating properties were isolated from earlier mainstream therapies. Isolated agents included adrenergic drugs such as [[adrenaline]] and [[ephedrine]], anticholinergic agents such as [[atropine]] and [[scopolamine]],  the expectorant [[acetylcysteine]], and [[theophylline]].<ref name="history">{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1925077|last1= Ziment |first1=I|title=History of the Treatment of Chronic Bronchitis| journal=Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases |volume=58  |issue=Supplement 1|pages=37–42|year= 1991 |pmid=1925077}}</ref>

==Acute exacerbations==
{{Main|Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis}}
''Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis'' (AECB) are episodes of difficulty in breathing in a person with chronic bronchitis.<ref name=medbroadcast>[http://www.medbroadcast.com/condition_info_details.asp?disease_id=285&next_page=y medbroadcast.com > Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis] Retrieved on 13 March 2010</ref>

During AECB, breathing becomes much more difficult because of further narrowing of the airways, in addition to increased secretion of mucus, which often is thicker than usual.<ref name=medbroadcast/>

Treatment of AECB may include:
* [[Cough suppressants]]<ref name=medbroadcast/>
* Inhaled [[bronchodilator]]s<ref name=medbroadcast/><ref name="pmid11281745">{{cite journal |author=Bach PB, Brown C, Gelfand SE, McCrory DC |title=Management of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a summary and appraisal of published evidence |journal=Ann.

* [[Antibiotics]] are used if a bacterial infection is the suspected cause.<ref name=medbroadcast/>  However, antibiotics will not treat exacerbations caused by viruses.<ref name=medbroadcast/>
