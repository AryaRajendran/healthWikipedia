'''Toe walking''' refers to a condition where a person walks on his or her [[toe]]s without putting much weight on the [[heel]] or any other part of the foot. Toe-walking in toddlers is common. These children usually adopt a normal walking pattern as they grow older. If a child continues to walk on his or her toes past the age of three, he or she should be evaluated by a doctor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/toe-walking/AN01253 |title= Toe Walking at mayoclinic.com |accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref>

Toe walking can be caused by different factors.  One type of toe walking is also called "habitual" or "idiopathic" toe walking, where the cause is unknown.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= S D Med |date=2008 |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=53, 55–7 |title= Idiopathic toe-walking |author= Babb A, Carlson WO |pmid=18432151}}</ref> Other causes include a congenital short [[Achilles tendon]], muscle spasticity (especially as associated with [[cerebral palsy]])  and paralytic muscle disease such as [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]].<ref name=emedicine/> It may also be one way of accommodating a separate condition, [[foot drop]]. Persistent toe walking in children has been identified as a potential early sign of [[autism]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Dev Med Child Neurol |date=1999 |volume=41 |issue=12 |pages=846–8 |title= Idiopathic toe-walking: a review |author= Sala DA, Shulman LH, Kennedy RF, Grant AD, Chu ML |pmid=10619285 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=2492 |format=PDF |doi= 10.1017/S0012162299001681}}</ref><ref name="Geschwind2009">{{cite journal |author=Geschwind DH |title=Advances in autism |journal=[[Annual Review of Medicine]] |volume=60 |issue= 1|pages=367–80 |year=2009 |pmid=19630577 |doi=10.1146/annurev.med.60.053107.121225 |url=}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==

A doctor will typically evaluate whether there is bilateral (both legs) toe walking, what the child's range of motion is (how far he or she can flex his or her feet) and perform a basic neurological exam.  Treatment will depend on the cause of the condition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orthoseek.com/articles/toewalk.html |title= Toe Walking at orthoseek.com|accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref>

==Treatment==

For idiopathic toe walking in young children, doctors may prefer to [[watchful waiting|watch and wait]]: the child may "outgrow" the condition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mastersofpediatrics.com/cme/cme2005/lecture30_1.asp |title= Toe Walking at mastersofpediatrics.com |accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> If there is a reduction in the child's range of motion, there are several options.<ref name=emedicine>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/orthoped/topic451.htm |title= Toe Walking at emedecine.com |accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref>
* Wearing a brace or splint either during the day, night or both which limits the ability of the child to walk on his or her toes and stretches the Achilles tendon.  One type of brace used is an AFO (ankle-foot orthosis).
* Serial casting where the foot is cast with the tendon stretched, and the cast is changed weekly with progressive stretching.
* [[Botulinum toxin|Botox therapy]] is used to paralyze the calf muscles to reduce the opposition of the muscles to stretching the Achilles stretching, usually together with serial casting or splinting.
* If conservative measures fail to correct the toe walking after about 12–24 months, surgical lengthening of the tendon is an option.  The surgery is typically done under full [[anesthesia]] but if there are no issues, the child is released the same day.  After the surgery, a below-the-knee walking cast is worn for six weeks and then an AFO is worn to protect the tendon for several months. 

For toe walking which results from more serious neuro-muscular conditions, additional specialists may need to be consulted.
