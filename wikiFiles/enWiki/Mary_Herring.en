==Early life==
Born the eldest of four children of Sir [[Thomas Ranken Lyle]], a mathematical physicist, and his wife, Frances Isobel Clare Millear, she attended [[Toorak College, Mt Eliza|Toorak College]] between 1906 and 1912, and she excelled both academically and at sport. In 1913 she entered the [[University of Melbourne]] as a medical student. She was captain of the women's [[tennis]] and [[Field hockey|hockey]] teams, obtaining [[University Sporting Blue]] in both sports. 

Mary graduated with her [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery]] (MB, BS) in 1921, achieving first-class honours in all subjects, with a first in medicine and fourth in surgery. She won the '''Keith Levi Memorial Scholarship''' in medicine and the Sameson prize in clinical medicine (Hilton). She became a resident surgeon at [[Royal Melbourne Hospital]] under Sir Alan Newton.

In 1918 she had met [[Edmund Herring]], then a young Australian [[Captain (army/air force)|captain]] in the [[British Army]] on leave from the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Macedonian front]] of the [[World War I|Great War]], and they were married on 6 April 1922 at Toorak Presbyterian Church. They had three daughters, Mary Cecile ("Molly"; b. 1924), Judith Ann ("Judy"; b. 1926), and Margaret Lyle (b. 1933).

==Career==
Mary Herring became a medical officer for the Pre-Natal Clinic at the [[Prahran]] Health Centre In 1926. This clinic was the first of its kind in [[Melbourne]], and became a model for similar clinic established by Mary in [[South Melbourne, Victoria|South Melbourne]] in 1940. At the time she started work at the Prahran clinic, she was a mother herself and pregnant with Judy, a circumstance of great interest to the women who sought advice or treatment at the clinic. She continued working at the Prahran Health Centre until 1945.

Herring joined the Melbourne District Nursing Society in 1931, and was its vice president from 1943 to 1953. Mary was one of three doctors who banded together to establish Women's Welfare Clinic to offer advice on [[birth control]], at a time when many doctors and a large segment of the community were opposed to it. This clinic functioned for one day a week until 1940 when it was discontinued, as the advice it offered could by then be obtained elsewhere.
