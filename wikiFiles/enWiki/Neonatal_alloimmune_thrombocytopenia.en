'''Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia''' ('''NAITP''' or '''NAIT''' or '''NAT''' for short; or '''fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia''', '''FNAIT''', '''feto-maternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia''', '''FMAITP''' or '''FMAIT''') is a [[disease]] that affects [[fetus]]es and [[neonates|newborns]], in which the [[platelet]] count is decreased (a state known as [[thrombocytopenia]]). Platelet antigens are inherited from both mother and father.  FNAIT is caused by antibodies specific for platelet antigens inherited from the father but which are absent in the mother.<ref> Roback et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda, AABB Press, 2008. </ref>  Fetomaternal transfusions (or fetomaternal hemorrhage) results in the recognition of these antigens by the mother's immune system as non-self, with the subsequent generation of allo-reactive antibodies which cross the placenta. NAIT, hence, is caused by transplacental passage of maternal platelet-specific [[alloantibodies|alloantibody]] and rarely [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) allo-antibodies <ref>Porcelijn L, Van den Akker ES, Oepkes D. Fetal thrombocytopenia (Review). Semin Fetal Neonatal Med 2008 Aug;13(4):223-30.</ref> (which are expressed by platelets) to fetuses whose platelets express the corresponding antigens. NAIT occurs in somewhere between 1/800

live births. More recent studies of NAIT seem to indicate that it occurs in around 1/600 live births in the Caucasian population.<ref>Kamphuis MM, Paridaans N, Porcelijn L, De Haas M, van der Schoot CE, Brand A, Bonsel GJ, Oepkes D.

==Signs and symptoms==
Frequently, the thrombocytopenia is mild and the affected neonates remain largely asymptomatic.  In these cases, therapeutic interventions are not indicated. In case of severe thrombocytopenia, the neonates may exhibit hemorrhagic complication at or a few hours after delivery. The most serious complication is intracranial hemorrhage, leading to death in approximately 10% or neurologic sequelae in 20% of cases.

==Pathophysiology==
About 80% of cases of NAIT are caused by antibodies against platelet antigen [[HPA-1a]], 15% by anti-[[HPA-5b]], and 5% by other antibodies.<ref>Mueller-Eckhardt C, Kiefel V, Grubert A, Kroll H, Weisheit M, Schmidt S, et al. 348 cases of fetal alloimmune thrombocytopenia. Lancet 1989;1: 363-6.</ref> HPA-1a is present in 98% of the population of the United States, suggesting that approximately 2% of women who are HPA-1a negative may be at risk for FNAIT during pregnancy .<ref> Roback et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda, AABB Press, 2008. </ref>, <ref> Mais DD. ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd Ed. Chicago: ASCP Press, 2009.</ref> Of course, the antigen expression of the father must also be taken into account.  Some studies have also shown a relationship between maternal HLA type DRw52a (DRB3* 0101) and the development of anti-HPA-1a. <ref> Birchall et al. European Collaborative Study of the Antenatal Management of Feto-Maternal Alloimmune Thrombocytopenia. Br J Haematol 2003; 122: 275-88. </ref>

The offending antibodies are IgG subtype and therefore capable of crossing the placenta and entering the fetal circulation.

Unlike [[hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn]] (HDFN), NAIT occurs during the first pregnancy in up to 50% of cases<ref>Roback et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda: AABB Press, 2008.</ref>, and the affected fetuses may develop severe thrombocytopenia (<50,000 /Î¼L) very early during pregnancy (as early as 20 weeks gestation, consistent with the development of platelet antigens <ref> Roback et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda, AABB Press, 2008 </ref>). Usually, the thrombocytopenia increases as gestation progresses. During the first pregnancy, NAIT is often not detected until birth when the newborn presents with classic symptoms of thrombocytopenia including [[petechiae]], bruising or intracranial hemorrhage. <ref> Roback et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda, AABB Press, 2008. </ref>  In utero intracranial hemorrhage occurs in about 10% to 30% of affected cases (and NAIT is thought to be the underlying cause in the majority of cases of intracranial hemorrhage due to thrommbocytopenia- greater than all other etiologies of thrombocytopenia combined) Approximately half of cases of intracranial hemorrhage occur in utero.  The risk of hemorrhage is inversely related to the platelet count with the greatest risk when the platelet count is below 100,000/uL <ref> Roback et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda, AABB Press, 2008. </ref> 

The recurrence of NAIT has been estimated to be more than 80% in subsequent pregnancies with incompatible fetuses (ie subsequent pregnancies which also carry the target platelet antigen).  Subsequent cases of NAIT may be equivalent or more severe.  

The fetal response to FNAIT is variable and may include compensatory extramedullary hematopoiesis.  Rarely, fetal hydrops may develop.  Fetal anemia (in absence of red cell incompatibility) may also occur. <ref> Roback et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda, AABB Press, 2008. </ref>

==Diagnosis==
Maternal and paternal platelet antigen phenotyping and screening of the maternal serum for anti-platelet antibodies can be performed.<ref>Mais DD. ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd Ed. Chicago: ASCP Press, 2009.</ref>

Additionally, platelet antigen [[genotyping]] can be performed on the maternal and paternal blood to determine the exact nature of the incompatibility.

Neonatal platelet counts on laboratory testing are typically under 20,000/uL.  Higher counts may suggest a different diagnosis, such as maternal [[immune thrombocytopenic purpura]] (ITP).

==Treatment==
===During pregnancy===
Cordocentesis can be performed in utero to determine the platelet count of the fetus.  This procedure is only performed if a PRIOR pregnancy was affected by NAIT.  Intrauterine transfusions can be performed during cordocentesis for primary prevention of intracerebral hemorrhage.  Any administered cellular blood products must be irradiated to reduce the risk of [[graft-versus-host disease]] (GVHD) in the fetus. Additionally, all administered blood products should be CMV reduced-risk (CMV seronegative and leukoreduced are considered essentially equivalent for the purposes of CMV risk reduction).<ref> Roback et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda, AABB Press, 2008. </ref> 


If intrauterine platelet transfusions are performed, they are generally repeated weekly (platelet lifespan after transfusion is approximately 8 to 10 days).   Platelets administered to the fetus must be negative for the culprit antigen (often HPA-1a, as stated above).  Many blood suppliers (such as [[American Red Cross]] and [[United Blood Services]]) have identified HPA-1a negative donors.  An alternative donor is the mother who is, of course, negative for the culprit antigen.  However, she must meet general criteria for donation and platelets received from the mother must be washed to remove the offending alloantibody and irradiated to reduce the risk of [[graft-versus-host disease]].  If platlet transfusions are needed urgently, incompatible platelets may be used, with the understanding that they may be less effective and that the administration of any blood product carries risk. <ref> Roback et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda, AABB Press, 2008. </ref> 


The use of [[Intravenous immunoglobulin]] ([[IVIG]]) during pregnancy and immediately after birth has been shown to help reduce or alleviate the effects of NAIT in infants and reduce the severity of thrombocytopenia.  The most common treatment is weekly [[IVIG]] infusions at a dosage of 1g/kg beginning at 16 to 28 weeks of pregnancy, depending on the severity of the disease in the previous affected child, and continuing until the birth of the child.<ref>{{cite web

BJOG 2007 Apr;114(4):469-73.</ref> In some cases this dosage is increased to 2g/kg and/or combined with a course of prednisone  depending on the exact circumstances of the case.  Although this treatment has not been shown to be effective in all cases it has been shown to reduce the severity of thrombocytopenia in some. Also, it is suspected that (though not understood why) IVIG provides some added protection from ICH (intercranial hemorrhage) to the fetus.  Even with IVIG treatment, the fetal platelet count may need to be monitored and platelet transfusions may still be required.  

The goal of both IVIG and platelet transfusion is to avoid hemorrhage.  Ultrasound monitoring to detect hemorrhage is not recommended as detection of intracranial hemorrhage generally indicates permanent brain damage (there is no intervention that can be performed to reverse the damage once it has occurred).  

Before delivery, the fetal platelet count should be determined.  A count of >50,000/uL is recommended for vaginal delivery and the count should be kept above 20,000/uL after birth.<ref> Roback et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda, AABB Press, 2008. </ref>

===After birth===
The most rapidly effective treatment in infants with severe hemorrhage and/or severe thrombocytopenia (<30x10<sup>9</sup>/L) is the transfusion of compatible platelets (i.e. platelets from a donor who, like the mother, lacks the causative antigen). Additionally, if the thrombocytopenia in the infant at birth is not severe enough to warrant a transfusion of platelets (>30x10<sup>9</sup>/L) an infusion of [[IVIG]] (1g/kg/day for two days) in the infant has been shown to rapidly increase [[platelet count]] and reduce the risk of related injury.

After a first affected pregnancy, if a mother has plans for a subsequent pregnancy, then the mother and father should be typed for platelet antigens and the mother screened for alloantibodies.  Testing is available through reference laboratories (such as ARUP).  DNA testing of the father can be used to determine zygosiity of the involved antigen and therefore risk to future pregnancies (if homozygous for the antigen, all subsequent pregnancies will be affected, if heterozygous, there is an approximate 50% risk to each subsequent pregnancy).  During subsequent pregnancies, the genotype of the fetus can also be determined using amniotic fluid analysis or maternal blood as early as 18 weeks gestation to definitively determine the risk to the fetus <ref> Roback et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda, AABB Press, 2008. </ref>

==Research==
PROFNAIT is a collaborative project that involves nine of the leading Northern European companies, universities and health care institutions within FNAIT prevention and therapy.

The goal of the PROFNAIT project is to develop a new drug that can protect HPA-1a negative women from being immunized against HPA-1a and prevent the development of FNAIT. The project also aims at preparing the country-wide screens of pregnant women that are required in order to identify the women who would benefit from prophylaxis.
 
The project is divided into three stages:
Collection of plasma from women who are already immunized against HPA-1a. This plasma is required to make the drug. We will need to collect plasma from hundreds of HPA-1a immunized women and we encourage all potential doners to sign up.  if you have given birth to an FNAIT child and want to help the project saving lives of babies at risk of developing FNAIT you may consider signing up as a plasma donor, visit the project website [http://www.profnait.eu www.profnait.eu/parents] to sign up.

In the second phase, we will show that the drug is both safe and effective. Firstly, we will see how well it works in healthy men; secondly, we will screen 75,000 pregnant women for HPA-1a status and invite the 1,500 HPA-1a negative women that we expect to find to participate in the final testing.

In the last phase, we will seek approval of the drug and prepare for the implementation of HPA-1a typing and prophylaxis worldwide.

== Related Conditions ==
[[Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura]] (ITP), sometimes called [[idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]] is a condition in which autoantibodies are directed against a patient's own platelets, causing platelet destruction and thrombocytopenia.  Anti-platelet autoantibodies in a pregnant woman with [[immune thrombocytopenic purpura]] will attack the patient's own platelets and will also cross the placenta and react against fetal platelets.  Therefore, ITP is a significant cause of fetal and neonatal immune thrombocytopenia.  Approximately 10% of newborns affected by ITP will have platelet counts <50,000/uL and 1% to 2% will have a risk of intracerebral hemorrhage comparable to infants with NAIT. <ref> Roback et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda, AABB Press, 2008. </ref> 
<ref> Webert, et al. A Retrospective 11-Year Analysis of Patients with Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura. Blood 2003; 102; 4306-11.</ref>


Mothers with thrombocytopenia or a previous diagnosis of ITP should be tested for serum antiplatelet antibodies.  A woman with symptomatic thrombocytopenia and an identifiable antiplatelet antibody should be started on therapy for their ITP which may include steroids or IVIG.  Fetal blood analysis to determine the platelet count is not generally performed as ITP-induced thrombocytopenia in the fetus is generally less severe than NAIT. Platelet transfusions may be performed in newborns, depending on the degree of thrombocytopenia. <ref> Roback et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda, AABB Press, 2008. </ref>
