[[Image:vacutainerrainbow small.jpg|right|frame|A range of Vacutainer tubes containing blood.]]
A '''vacutainer''' [[blood collection]] tube is a [[sterile]] glass or plastic tube with a closure that is evacuated to create a vacuum inside the tube facilitating the draw of a predetermined volume of liquid. Most commonly used to draw a blood sample directly from the vein, these also are used to collect urine samples. Vacutainer tubes may contain additives designed to stabilize and preserve the specimen prior to analytical testing. Tubes are available with or without a safety-engineered closure, with a variety of labeling options and closure colors as well as a range of draw volumes.

Vacutainer tubes, invented by Joe Kleiner and BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) in 1949, are manufactured and sold by BD. Vacutainer is a registered trademark of Becton, Dickinson and Company.

==Principles==

[[Image:Vacutainer 01.jpg|right|thumb|Tiger top Vacutainer filled with blood.]]

The [[vein]] is first punctured with the [[hypodermic needle]] which is carried in a translucent plastic holder. The needle is double ended, the second shorter needle being shrouded for safety by the holder. When a Vacutainer test tube is pushed down into the holder, its [[rubber]] cap is pierced by the second needle and the pressure difference between the blood volume and the vacuum in the tube forces blood through the needle and into the tube. The filled tube is then removed and another can be inserted and filled the same way. It is important to remove the tube before withdrawing the needle, as there may still be some suction left, causing pain upon withdrawal.

The test tubes are covered with a color-coded plastic cap. They often include additives that mix with the blood when collected (see below), and the colour of the tube's plastic cap indicates which additives that tube contains.

The plastic caps are opaque for tubes with a normal vacuum. Translucent-topped tubes contain a weaker vacuum in the same sized tube, and will obtain less blood. The weaker suction makes them more suitable for smaller sized veins, because the standardised suction of the tubes may cause the veins of elderly people or those with delicate veins, to collapse. In this case a [[syringe]] should be used instead.

==Contents of tubes==
[[Image:sstvacutainer small.jpg|right|frame|A large [[Serum-separating tube|SST II]] vacutainer.]]The tubes may contain additional substances that preserve the blood for processing in the [[medical laboratory]]. Using the wrong tube may therefore make the blood sample unusable.

The substances may include [[anticoagulant]]s ([[EDTA]], [[sodium citrate]], [[heparin]]) or a gel with intermediate density between [[blood cell]]s and [[blood plasma|serum]]. Additionally, some tubes contain substances that preserve certain chemicals or substances within the blood, such as glucose. When the tube is [[centrifuge]]d, the blood cells sink to the bottom of the tube, are covered by a layer of the gel, and the [[blood plasma|serum]] is left on top. The gel enables the tube to be tipped upside-down and transported without the blood cells remixing with the serum. When a tube that contains an anticoagulant is centrifuged, the clear liquid is plasma, which contains the clotting factors.

The meaning of the different colors are standardized across manufacturers.<ref name="harvard">{{cite web|title=Specimen Collection Tubes & Containers|url=http://labmed.bwh.harvard.edu/general/tubes.html|accessdate=2006-02-01}}</ref><ref name="tmc">{{cite web|url=http://medic.med.uth.tmc.edu/hcprof/blood/spec-vol.htm|title=Quick Collection List|accessdate=2006-02-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051216030111/http://medic.med.uth.tmc.edu/hcprof/blood/spec-vol.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2005-12-16}}</ref><ref name="utah">{{cite web|url=http://www-medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/PHLEB/PHLEB.html|title=Blood collection: routine venipuncture and specimen handling|accessdate=2006-02-01}}</ref>

The ''order of draw'' refers to the sequence in which these tubes should be filled. The needle which pierces the tubes can carry additives from one tube into the next, and so the sequence is standardized so that any cross-contamination of additives will not affect laboratory results.<ref name="utah"/>

===Containers containing coagulants===
*Gold or 'Tiger' Red/Black top: Clot activator and gel for serum separation
*Red top PLASTIC tubes: Contains a clot activator and is used when serum is needed
*Orange or Grey/Yellow 'Tiger' Top: Contain Thrombin, a rapid clot activator, for STAT serum testing

===Containers containing anticoagulants===
* Green - Contains sodium [[heparin]] or lithium heparin used for plasma determinations in [[clinical chemistry]] (e.g. [[urea]] and [[electrolyte]] determination).
*Light Green or Green/Gray 'Tiger': For plasma determinations.
* Purple or lavender - contains [[EDTA]] (the potassium salt, or K<sub>2</sub>EDTA). This is a strong anticoagulant and these tubes are usually used for [[complete blood count]]s (CBC) and [[blood film]]s. Lavender top tubes are generally used when whole blood is needed for analysis. Can also be used for some blood bank procedures such as blood type and screen, but other blood bank procedures, such as crossmatches must be in a pink tube in most facilities.
* Grey - These tubes contain [[fluoride]] and [[oxalate]]. Fluoride prevents enzymes in the blood from working, by preventing the stage called glycolysis so a substrate such as [[glucose]] will not be gradually used up during storage. Oxalate is an anticoagulant.
* Light blue - Contain a measured amount of [[citrate]]. Citrate is a reversible anticoagulant, and these tubes are used for [[coagulation]] assays. Because the liquid citrate dilutes the blood, it is important the tube is full so the dilution is properly accounted for.
* Dark Blue - Contains sodium heparin, an anticoagulant. Also can contain EDTA as an additive or have no additive. These tubes are used for trace metal analysis.
* Pink - Similar to purple tubes (both contain EDTA) these are used for blood banking.
* Black - Used for ESR also known as Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate or "sed rate." Goes to hematology department.

===Other===
* Red (glass)- Contains no additives. Tests for antibodies and drugs often require these.
* Light yellow - Contains sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS). Used for blood culture specimens or [[acid-citrate-dextrose]] (ACD), used for blood bank studies, [[HLA phenotyping]], and [[parental testing]].
* Tan (glass or plastic) - Contains either sodium heparin (glass) or K<sub>2</sub>EDTA (plastic). Used for lead determinations. These tubes are certified to contain no lead. .

The plastic version, known as Vacutainer PLUS, was developed at Becton Dickinson Research Center, RTP, NC in 1991-1993, by co-inventors E. Vogler, D. Montgomery and G. Harper amongst others of the Surface Science Group as US patents 5344611, 5326535, 5320812, 5257633 and 5246666.<ref name= "US Patent Trademark Office">{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm|title=US Patent Office Patent number search}}</ref>

===Culture===
The ''purple top tube'' became an issue in the [[O.J. Simpson murder case]] when the defense alleged that small droplets of blood found at the crime scene contained the preservative EDTA; had this been true, it would have meant that the droplet might have been taken from the purple top tube used to collect Simpson's blood and planted at the crime scene.<ref name="cnn-transcript">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/OJ/simpson.civil.trial/transcripts.january/01.16.transcript.html|title=Transcript of 1997 Simpson civil trial|accessdate=2006-04-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070101104501/http://www.cnn.com/US/OJ/simpson.civil.trial/transcripts.january/01.16.transcript.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-01-01}}</ref>
