The '''palatoglossus''', '''glossopalatinus''', or '''palatoglossal muscle''' is a small fleshy fasciculus, narrower in the middle than at either end, forming, with the mucous membrane covering its surface, the [[glossopalatine arch]]. 

It arises from the anterior surface of the [[soft palate]], where it is continuous with the muscle of the opposite side, and passing downward, forward, and lateralward in front of the palatine tonsil, is inserted into the side of the [[tongue]], some of its fibers spreading over the dorsum, and others passing deeply into the substance of the organ to intermingle with the [[transverse muscle of tongue]].

==Action==
Elevates posterior tongue, closes the [[oropharyngeal isthmus]], and aids initiation of swallowing.

==Innervation==
The palatoglossus is the only muscle of the tongue that is ''not'' innervated by the [[hypoglossal nerve]] (CN XII). It is innervated by the [[Vagus nerve]] (CN X)

But some sources state that the palatoglossus is innervated by fibres from the cranial part of the [[accessory nerve]] (CN XI) that travel via the [[pharyngeal plexus of vagus nerve|pharyngeal plexus]].<ref>Section 3, Chapter 35 - Neck and Upper Aerodigestive Tract - Pharynx. In: Standring, S, editors. Gray's Anatomy: The Anatomical Basis of Clinical Practice, 39th Edition. London: Elsevier; 2008. p628</ref>

Other sources state that the palatoglossus is not innervated by XI hitchhiking on X, but rather it is innervated by X via the pharyngeal plexus formed from IX and X.<ref>Chapter 8 Head and Neck. In: Drake RL, Vogl W, Mitchell AWM, editors. Gray's Anatomy for Students. London: Elsevier; 2005. p991</ref>
