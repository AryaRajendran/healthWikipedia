The '''Childhood Cancer Parents Alliance''' ('''CCPA''') — previously known as '''The National Alliance of Childhood Cancer Parent Organisations''' ('''NACCPO''')  — is a UK registered cancer [[charitable organization|charity]] to aid the stability of children's lives when they have been diagnosed with [[cancer]]. The charity focuses on the wellbeing and support of the whole family to bring together member groups to help the family in difficult times during treatment and medication.
