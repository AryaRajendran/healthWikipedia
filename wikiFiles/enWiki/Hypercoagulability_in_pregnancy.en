'''Hypercoagulability in pregnancy''' is the propensity of [[pregnant]] women to develop [[thrombosis]] (blood clots). Pregnancy itself is a factor of [[hypercoagulability]] (pregnancy-induced hypercoagulability), as a physiologically adaptive mechanism to prevent [[postpartum hemorrhage|''post partum'' bleeding]].<ref name=gresele/> However, when combined with an additional underlying hypercoagulable states, the risk of thrombosis or embolism may become substantial.<ref name=gresele>Page 264 in: {{cite book |author=Gresele, Paolo |title=Platelets in hematologic and cardiovascular disorders: a clinical handbook |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-521-88115-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Causes==
Pregnancy-induced hypercoagulability is probably a physiologically adaptive mechanism to prevent ''post partum'' hemorrhage.<ref name=gresele/> Pregnancy changes the plasma levels of many [[clotting factor]]s, such as [[fibrinogen]], which can rise up to three times its normal value.<ref name=lablines/> [[Thrombin]] levels increase.<ref name="de Boer-1989">{{cite journal | author=de Boer K, ten Cate JW, Sturk A, Borm JJ, Treffers PE. | title=Enhanced thrombin generation in normal and hypertensive pregnancy. | journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol | year=1989 | volume=160 | issue=1 | pages=95–100 | pmid=2521425}}</ref> [[Protein S]], an anticoagulant, decreases. However, the other major anticoagulants, [[protein C]] and [[antithrombin III]], remain constant.<ref name=lablines/> [[Fibrinolysis]] is impaired by an increase in [[plasminogen activator inhibitor-1]] (PAI-1 or PAI) and [[plasminogen activator inhibitor-2]] (PAI-2), the latter synthesized from the placenta.<ref name=lablines/> [[Venous stasis]] may occur at the end of the [[first trimester]], due to enhanced [[Compliance (physiology)|compliance]] of the vessel walls by a hormonal effect.<ref name=lablines/>

Also, pregnancy can cause hypercoagulability by other factors, e.g. the [[prolonged bed rest]] that often occurs ''post partum'' that occurs in case of delivery by [[Forceps in childbirth|forceps]], [[vacuum extractor]] or [[Caesarean section]].<ref name=lablines/> Pregnancy after the age of 35 augments the risk of VTE, as does [[multigravidity]] of more than four pregnancies.<ref name=lablines/> Several [[Complications of pregnancy|pregnancy complications]], such as [[pre-eclampsia]], cause substantial hypercoagulability.<ref name=lablines/>

General causes of hypercoagulability, about as common in pregnancy as in the general population, include both acquired ones such as [[antiphospholipid antibodies]], and congenital ones, including [[factor V Leiden]], [[prothrombin mutation]], [[protein C]] and [[protein S|S]] deficiencies, and [[antithrombin III deficiency]].

==Complications==
[[Deep vein thrombosis]] has an incidence of one in 1,000 to 2,000 pregnancies in the United States,<ref name=lablines>[http://pathology.uc.edu/LABLINES/V8I5.pdf Hypercoagulability during Pregnancy] Lab Lines. A publication of the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of Cincinnati. September/October 2002 Volume 8, Issue 5</ref> and is the second most common cause of [[maternal death]] in developed countries after bleeding.<ref name=uppsala/>

==Prevention of thrombosis with anticoagulants==
While the consensus among physicians is the safety of the mother supersedes the safety of the developing [[fetus]], changes in the [[anticoagulation]] regimen during pregnancy can be performed to minimize the risks to the developing fetus while maintaining therapeutic levels of anticoagulants in the mother.

The main issue with anticoagulation in pregnancy is that [[warfarin]], the most commonly used anticoagulant in chronic administration, is known to have [[teratology|teratogenic effects]] on the fetus if administered in early pregnancy.<ref name="Sathienkijkanchai-2005">{{cite journal | author=Sathienkijkanchai A, Wasant P. | title=Fetal warfarin syndrome. | journal=J Med Assoc Thai | year=2005 | volume=88 | issue=Suppl 8 | pages=S246–50 | pmid=16856447}}</ref><ref name="Schaefer-2006">{{cite journal | author=Schaefer C, Hannemann D, Meister R, Eléfant E, Paulus W, Vial T, Reuvers M, Robert-Gnansia E, Arnon J, De Santis M, Clementi M, Rodriguez-Pinilla E, Dolivo A, Merlob P. | title=Vitamin K antagonists and pregnancy outcome.

===Indications===
In general, the indications for anticoagulation during pregnancy are the same as the general population. This includes (but is not limited to) a recent history of [[deep venous thrombosis]] (DVT) or [[pulmonary embolism]], a metallic [[artificial heart valve|prosthetic heart valve]], and [[atrial fibrillation]] in the setting of structural heart disease.

In addition to these indications, anticoagulation may be of benefit in individuals with [[lupus erythematosus]] and a history of previous [[spontaneous abortion]]s, individuals who have a history of DVT or PE associated with a previous pregnancy, and even with individuals with a history of coagulation factor deficiencies and DVT not associated with a previous pregnancy.<ref name="Couto-2005">{{cite journal | author=Couto E, Nomura ML, Barini R, Pinto e Silva JL. | title=Pregnancy-associated venous thromboembolism in combined heterozygous factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations. | journal=Sao Paulo Med J | year=2005 | volume=123 | issue=6 | pages=286–8 | pmid=16444389 | url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-31802005000600007&tlng=es&lng=en&nrm=iso | doi=10.1590/S1516-31802005000600007}}</ref>

===Strategies===
A consensus on the correct anticoagulation regimen during pregnancy is lacking. Treatment is tailored to the particular individual based on her risk of complications. Warfarin and other [[vitamin K]]-inhibiting agents are contraindicated during the [[first trimester]] of pregnancy because of the teratogenic effects,<ref name="Shaul-1975">{{cite journal | author=Shaul WL, Emery H, Hall JG. | title=Chondrodysplasia punctata and maternal warfarin use during pregnancy. | journal=Am J Dis Child | year=1975 | volume=129 | issue=3 | pages=360–2 | pmid=1121966}}</ref> and should not be administered when the pregnancy is confirmed.<ref name=nhs/> Rather, women who are on chronic anticoagulation may be given the option of conversion to either unfractionated [[heparin]] or [[low molecular weight heparin]] (LMWH), such as [[tinzaparin]],<ref name=nhs>[http://www.nnuh.nhs.uk/viewdoc.asp?ID=265&t=TrustDoc] ''Therapeutic anticoagulation in pregnancy.'' Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (NHS Trust). Reference number CA3017. 9th June 2006 [review June 2009]</ref>  prior to a planned [[fertilisation|conception]].<ref name="James-2007">{{cite journal | author=James AH, Grotegut CA, Brancazio LR, Brown H. | title=Thromboembolism in pregnancy: recurrence and its prevention. | journal=Semin Perinatol | year=2007 | volume=31 | issue=3 | pages=167–75 | pmid=17531898 | doi=10.1053/j.semperi.2007.03.002}}</ref> LMWH is as safe and efficacious as unfractionated heparin.<ref name=nhs/> A [[blood test]] including [[platelets]] and a [[clotting screen]] should be performed prior to administration of anticoagulant regimens in pregnancy.<ref name=nhs/>

[[Subcutaneous]] tinzaparin may be given at doses of 175 units of antifactor Xa activity per kg,<ref name=nhs/> based on prepregnancy or booking weight at approximately 16 weeks, and not the current weight.<ref name=nhs/> While unfractionated heparin is otherwise typically given in an intravenous formulation, this is inconvenient for the prolonged period of administration required in pregnancy.

Whether warfarin can be reinitiated after the 12th week of pregnancy is unclear.  In a recent retrospective analysis, resumption of warfarin after the first trimester is completed is associated with increased risk of loss of the fetus.<ref name="Kim-2006">{{cite journal | author=Kim BJ, An SJ, Shim SS, Jun JK, Yoon BH, Syn HC, Park JS. | title=Pregnancy outcomes in women with mechanical heart valves. | journal=J Reprod Med | year=2006 | volume=51 | issue=8 | pages=649–54 | pmid=16967636}}</ref>  However, this analysis included only individuals who were treated with anticoagulants for mechanical heart valves, who generally require high levels of anticoagulation.

In pregnant women with mechanical heart valves, the optimal anticoagulation regimen is particularly unclear. Anticoagulation with subcutaneous heparin in this setting is associated with a high incidence of [[thrombosis]] of the valve and death.<ref name="Iturbe-Alessio-1986">{{cite journal | doi=10.1056/NEJM198611273152205 | author=Iturbe-Alessio I, Fonseca MC, Mutchinik O, Santos MA, Zajarías A, Salazar E. | title=Risks of anticoagulant therapy in pregnant women with artificial heart valves. | journal=N Engl J Med | year=1986 | volume=315 | issue=22 | pages=1390–3 | pmid=3773964}}</ref><ref name="Salazar-1996">{{cite journal | author=Salazar E, Izaguirre R, Verdejo J, Mutchinick O. | title=Failure of adjusted doses of subcutaneous heparin to prevent thromboembolic phenomena in pregnant patients with mechanical cardiac valve prostheses. | journal=J Am Coll Cardiol | year=1996 | volume=27 | issue=7 | pages=1698–703 | pmid=8636556 | doi=10.1016/0735-1097(96)00072-1}}</ref>  Similar issues are likely associated with the use of [[enoxaparin]] (a

===By risk score===
Prevention of DVT and other types of venous thrombosis may be required if certain predisposing risk factors are present. One example is based on the point system below, where points are summed to give the appropriate prophylaxis regimen.<ref name=uppsala>Venös tromboembolism (VTE) - Guidelines for treatment in C counties. Bengt Wahlström, Emergency department, Uppsala Academic Hospital. January 2008</ref>

After adding any risk factors together, a total of one point or less indicates no preventive action is needed.<ref name=uppsala/> A total of two points indicates short-term prophylaxis, e.g. with LMWH, may be used in temporary risk factors, as well as administering prophylactic treatment seven days [[postpartum]], starting a couple of hours after birth.<ref name=uppsala/> A total of '''3 points''' increases the necessary duration of [[postpartum|''post partum'']] prophylaxis to six weeks.<ref name=uppsala/> 

A risk score of four points or higher means prophylaxis in the [[antepartum|''ante partum'']] period is needed, as well as at least six weeks ''post partum''.<ref name=uppsala/> A previous distal DVT indicates a minimum of 12 weeks (three months) of therapeutic anticoagulation therapy.<ref name=nhs/> A previous proximal DVT or pulmonary embolism requires a minimum of 26 weeks (6.5 months) of therapy<ref name=nhs/> If the therapy duration reaches delivery time, the remaining duration may be given after delivery, possibly extending the minimum of six weeks of ''post partum'' therapy.<ref name=nhs/> In a very high risk, high-dose ''ante partum'' prophylaxis should be continued at least 12 weeks after delivery.<ref name=uppsala/>

Women with [[antiphospholipid syndrome]] should have an additional low-dose prophylactic treatment of [[aspirin]].<ref name=uppsala/>

===Cautions===
All anticoagulants (including LMWH) should be used with caution in women with suspected [[coagulopathy]], [[thrombocytopaenia]], [[liver disease]] and [[nephropathy]].<ref name=nhs/>

Major side effects of [[tinzaparin]] are [[osteoporosis]] (occurring in up to 1% of cases), [[thrombocytopenia]] ([[heparin-induced thrombocytopenia]]), [[haemorrhage]], [[hair loss]] and [[drug allergy]].<ref name=nhs/> Still, LMWHs are much less likely to cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia than unfractionated heparin.<ref name=nhs/>

[[Regional anaesthesia]] is contraindicated in women on therapeutic anticoagulation, and should not be used within 24 hours of the last dose of tinzaparin.<ref name=nhs/>

===Monitoring===
Anticoagulant therapy with LMWH is not usually monitored.<ref name=nhs/> LMWH therapy does not affect the [[prothrombin time]] (PT) or the [[International normalized ratio|INR]], and anti-Xa levels are not reliable.<ref name=nhs/> It can prolong the [[partial thromboplastin time]] (APTT) in some women, but still, the APTT is not useful for monitoring.<ref name=nhs/>

To check for any thrombocytopenia, [[platelet count]] should be checked prior to commencing anticoagulant therapy, then seven to 10 days after commencement, and monthly thereafter.<ref name=nhs/> Platelet count should also be checked if unexpected bruising or bleeding occurs.<ref name=nhs/>

===Reversal===
[[Protamine]] reverses the effect of unfractionated heparin, but only partially binds to and reverses LMWH. A dose of 1&nbsp;mg protamine / 100 IU LMWH reverses 90% of its anti-IIa and 60% of [[anti-Xa activity]], but the clinical effect of the residual anti-Xa activity is not known.<ref name=nhs/> Both anti-IIa and anti-Xa activity may return up to three hours after protamine reversal, possibly due to release of additional LMWH from depot tissues.<ref name=nhs/>

===Anticoagulants in breastfeeding===
Warfarin, heparin and LMWH do not seem to pass into breast milk, so these are not contraindicated in [[breastfeeding]].<ref name=nhs/>
