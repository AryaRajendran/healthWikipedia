'''MVA-B''', or '''Modified Vaccinia Ankara B''', is a particular [[HIV vaccine]] created to give immune resistance to infection by the [[human immunodeficiency virus]]. It was developed by a team of [[Spain|Spanish]] researchers at the [[Spanish National Research Council]]'s Biotechnology National Centre headed by Dr. Mariano Esteban. The vaccine is based on the [[Modified vaccinia Ankara]] (MVA) virus used during the 1970s to help eradicate the [[smallpox virus]]. The B in the name "refers to HIV-B, the most common [[HIV subtype]] in Europe".<ref name="Giz">{{cite news |title=This 90 Percent Successful Vaccine May Be Our Best Chance to Eradicate AIDS |author=Jesus Diaz |url=http://gizmodo.com/5844706/this-90-successful-vaccine-may-be-our-best-chance-to-eradicate-aids |newspaper=[[Gizmodo]] |date=September 28, 2011 |accessdate=September 29, 2011}}</ref> It has been stated by Dr. Esteban that, in the future, the vaccine could potentially reduce the [[virulence]] of HIV to a "minor chronic infection akin to herpes".<ref name="II">{{cite news |title=HIV could be 'minor infection' with new vaccine |author=Stephen Adams |url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/hiv-could-be-minor-infection-with-new-vaccine-2891378.html |newspaper=[[Irish Independent]] |date=September 29, 2011 |accessdate=September 29, 2011}}</ref>

==History==
===Non-human testing===
The vaccine was originally tested on a number of mice and [[Macaque|macaque monkeys]] in 2008 against the [[Simian immunodeficiency virus]] (SIV) and it was found to be successful in every case in creating an immune system response to SIV infection.<ref name="Giz"/><ref name="Medindia">{{cite news |title=Promising Show By HIV Vaccine MVA-B In Clinical Trials |author=Gopalan T |url=http://www.medindia.net/news/Promising-Show-By-HIV-Vaccine-MVA-B-In-Clinical-Trials-91233-1.htm |newspaper=[[Medindia]] |date=September 28, 2011 |accessdate=September 29, 2011}}</ref>

===Phase I testing===
The initial testing on human subjects was conducted on a testing pool of thirty HIV-free individuals. Six of the pool were given a [[placebo]] and had no results. Of the other twenty-four individuals, twenty-two exhibited a "very strong immunological response against the HIV virus", bringing the success rate of the testing to 92%. The [[Immune response|immune reaction]] that the successful testers exhibited lasted for a period close to a year for 85% of the testers, who had no "significant secondary effects".<ref name="Giz"/> It was also shown that, from blood tests in the 48th week after administration of the vaccine, in 72.5% of the volunteers, "specific antibodies" had formed to combat possible HIV infection. Specifically, the blood tests revealed that the immune system production of [[CD4+ T lymphocytes]] and [[Cytotoxic T cell|CD8+ T lymphocytes]] were at 38.5% and 69.2% each for the testers given the vaccine, while the amounts in the group given the placebo remained at 0%.<ref name="Medindia"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Vaccin gör HIV till "mindre infektion" |author=Ylva Mossing |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article13704939.ab |newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]] |date=September 29, 2011 |accessdate=September 29, 2011 |language=Swedish}}</ref>

The next step with the vaccine within Phase I testing is to conduct a trial with HIV-positive testers, in order to determine if there is a "therapeutical effect of the vaccine" on those already infected with the virus.<ref name="Giz"/>

==Virology==
In order to create the vaccine, researchers took the prior Modified Vaccinia Ankara virus and added four [[genes]] from the [[Structure and genome of HIV|HIV genome]], specifically those titled [[Group-specific antigen|Gag]], [[Pol (HIV)|Pol]], [[Nef (protein)|Nef]] and [[Env (gene)|Env]].<ref name="Giz"/>
