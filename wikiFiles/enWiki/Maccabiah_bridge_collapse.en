The '''Maccabiah bridge collapse''' was the catastrophic failure of a pedestrian bridge over the [[Yarkon River]] in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]] on July 14, 1997.  The collapse of the temporary wooden structure killed four and injured 60 [[Australia]]n athletes who were visiting Israel to participate in the [[Maccabiah Games]].  One of the four athletes died during the collapse, but the other three were killed afterwards by infections caused by exposure to the polluted river water.<ref>Trounson</ref>

Five people, including the engineer who designed the bridge and the chairman of the Tel Aviv Games Organising Committee, were later convicted of recklessly causing death and injury.  The incident and subsequent inquiries were extensively reported on by the Australian media.  The [[Tragedy (event)|tragedy]] highlighted Israel's neglect of environmental issues, especially with regard to its rivers and waterways.<ref>Trounson; Schmemann</ref>

==Background==
{{Further2|[[Maccabiah Games]]}}
The Maccabiah Games, first staged in 1932, is an athletic event held every four years in Tel Aviv, Israel, to celebrate the [[History of Israel#1897—1917: The Zionist Revolution|Zionist Revolution]], and to demonstrate the unity and athleticism of the [[Jewish people]].<ref>Tal, p. 2.</ref> The games include competitions for adults and for junior athletes aged 15 to 18, and
are open to all Israeli citizens and non-Israeli Jews from around the world.<ref>Maccabiah Games, "[http://www.maccabiah.com/imgs/ntext/catalog/BasicRules11.pdf 18th Maccabiah Basic Regulations]," November 5, 2009.</ref>

The [[1997 Maccabiah Games|15th Maccabiah Games]], held in 1997 and billed as the third largest sporting event in the world, included 5,300 participants from 56 nations competing in 38 athletic events. The opening ceremony on July 14 at 8 p.m. (local time), held at [[Ramat Gan Stadium]] and designed to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the [[First Zionist Congress]], was attended by 50,000 people and featured hundreds of dancers, dazzling sound and light displays, and was shown live on Israeli television. As at past games, a temporary footbridge, 60 feet long and 18 feet wide, was constructed across the nearby Yarkon River to allow competitors to march into the stadium during the ceremony from an assembly area on the other side of the river.<ref>Tal, pp. 2–3; Schmemann, "2 Die..."; Slater.</ref>

==Collapse==
As scheduled during the opening ceremony, the participating athletes, teamed with their respective national delegations, began to march across the bridge and into the stadium.  The second nation to cross the bridge, following the [[Austria]]n team, consisted of the 373 members of the Australian delegation.  As the Australian athletes, packed together in parallel rows of six, crossed the river the bridge's support beams at roughly mid-span suddenly snapped, plunging around 100 of the Australians eight meters into the river below.  Several of the fallen were forcibly submerged in the 1.6 meter deep river by the press of falling athletes above them.<ref>Slater; Tal, p. 1; ''New York Times'', "5 Deny Guilt...".</ref>

Other athletes, bystanders, event staff, and policemen leapt into the river to rescue the fallen. Inside the stadium, Israeli government officials, including [[President of Israel|President]] [[Ezer Weizman]], chose to continue with the opening ceremony, but canceled the remainder of the march of the national teams into the stadium.  Israeli television maintained live coverage, switching back and forth between the frantic rescue efforts outside the stadium and the festive dancing and light shows inside.<ref>Tal, pp. 1–3; Schmemann, "Israelis Turn..."; Slater; Schmemann, "2 Die...".  Schmemann reports that Weizman and Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] departed immediately upon the end of the ceremony to visit the victims at the hospitals and that the games were suspended for 24 hours as a sign of mourning.</ref>

The 67 injured were taken to nearby [[Rabin Medical Center|Beilinson Hospital]] in [[Petah Tikva]] and [[Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center]].  One victim, Gregory Small, 37, a [[Bowling|bowler]] from [[Sydney]], was dead on arrival, apparently as a result of injuries suffered during the fall. The remaining 66 victims did not appear to have suffered life-threatening injuries. Their injuries included broken bones and water inhalation.<ref>Tal, p. 1; Schmemann, "2 Die...".  Schmemann gives the name as "Smalls" and states that two of the injured were Israeli policemen who dived into the river to rescue victims.</ref>

===Infections===
[[File:Ichilov.jpg|thumb|right|Tel Aviv Medical Center]]Within an hour or two of admission to the hospital, a number of victims began to show signs of [[asphyxia]]. Doctors discovered that an unidentified organism was attacking their [[respiratory system]]s and [[Lung|pulmonary]] blood vessels. By the next morning, seven athletes were in critical condition.<ref>Tal, pp. 1–2.</ref>

Patrick Surkin, who ran the [[intensive care unit]] at Tel Aviv Medical Center, wondered whether a toxin might be the culprit behind the infections. He contacted David Pargament, chief of the [[Yarkon River#Yarkon River Authority|Yarkon River Authority]]. Pargament explained that 36 hours before the collapse, [[mosquito larvicide oil]], a mixture of [[jet fuel]] and oil, had been sprayed on the surface of the Yarkon to suppress mosquitoes. Subsequent lab tests, however, found no traces of the substance in the sick athletes.<ref>Tal, pp 2–3.</ref>

Bowler Yetty Bennett, 50, died later that day from asphyxia. Elizabeth Sawicki, 47, a member of the delegation's [[Contract bridge|bridge]] team, died July 26 from complications from infection.  Bowler Warren Zines, 54, died on August 10, 1997 of severe respiratory-tract infection at [[Sheba Medical Center]].  Zines was the fourth and final fatality from the accident.<ref>Trounson; Tepperman; Goldberg, "Wound still festers..."; Segal, "Israeli court..."; ''New York Times'', "Death Tied to Pollution"' Schmemann, "2 Die...".</ref>

An autopsy of Zines finally identified the source of the infections as [[Pseudallescheria boydii]] fungus.  The fungus, usually fatal when infecting humans, colonizes in the lungs, causing pneumonia and killing cells.  The microbes that it spawns often spread infection to the brain, kidneys, heart, and thyroid.<ref>Tal, p. 4.</ref>

After Zines' death, one athlete, Sasha Elterman, 15, remained in critical condition.  Elterman, a tennis player, underwent 18 surgeries in the six months after the collapse, 13 of them brain surgeries.  Sasha Elterman was hospitalized and treated at the Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel in Petah-Tikva. Elterman ultimately survived her ordeal, but her lungs permanently lost 40% of their capacity and she suffered from periodic convulsions.<ref>Tal, p. 4.</ref>

==Initial investigations==
Israel's deputy minister of education, [[Moshe Peled (politician)|Moshe Peled]], immediately convened a public commission, chaired by Yishai Dotan, to investigate the collapse.  Israeli police also conducted their own investigation.  The Dotan Commission released its findings on July 23, 1997.  The commission found that the Maccabiah Games' organizing committee, led by Yoram Eyal, had departed from the usual practice of paying the [[Israeli army]] to construct the bridge.  Instead, in an apparent effort to reduce costs, Eyal contracted with a company called [[Irgunit]], headed by Adam Mishori, to construct the bridge.  Irgunit's traditional business was the [[Set construction|construction of props and stage sets]] for [[Theatrical scenery|theater productions]].  The company had never designed nor built a [[bridge]].<ref>Zycher; Segal, "Maccabiah bridge collapse blame..."; Segal, "Israeli court convicts five..."; Tal, pp. 2–3.</ref>

Irgunit sub-contracted the bridge's construction to Baruch Karagula and Yehoshua Ben-Ezra (also known as "Ben-Ezra Construction").  The commission found that Karagula and Ezra were not licensed to build bridges, had never attempted to build a bridge, and used substandard materials in the bridge's construction.  Photographs taken after the collapse showed that the bridge was constructed out of rusty metal pipes bound together with wire.<ref>Zycher; Segal, "Maccabiah bridge collapse blame..."; Segal, "Israeli court convicts five..."; Tal, pp. 2–3.</ref>

The commission concluded that the bridge's engineer, Micha Bar-Ilan, did not submit a blueprint for the bridge, designed a bridge that was inadequate for its intended use, and did not properly supervise or coordinate the bridge's construction.  The commission faulted the Maccabiah Games' organizers for poor coordination and oversight over the bridge's assembly.<ref>Segal, "Maccabiah bridge collapse blame..."; Segal, "Israeli court convicts five..."</ref>

An investigation by Augustine Zycher for the [[AIJAC|Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council]] reported that the Israeli army had employed Tamir Rowner, an experienced bridge construction engineer, to build previous bridges for the games.  For the 1997 games, Maccabiah officials, apparently unwilling to pay the army's price of $111,000, accepted a bid from Irgunit to build the bridge for $34,750.<ref>Zycher.  Rowner had already began designing the 1997 bridge.  As designed, Rowner's bridge would have been able to support 650 people at a time.</ref>

According to Zycher, Mishori kept $7,700 of the payment and gave the rest to Karagula and Ben-Ezra to erect the bridge.  Karagula and Ben-Ezra hired Bar-Ilan to design and oversee the bridge's construction.  Bar-Ilan claimed that his bridge as designed would support 250&nbsp;kg per square meter, which did not meet Israeli government standards which required a pedestrian bridge to support 500&nbsp;kg per square meter.  In any event, the Dotan investigation found that the bridge was far weaker than what Bar-Ilan claimed.  Furthermore, a municipal permit was required to construct the bridge, which Karagula and Ben-Ezra did not obtain.  The municipality in which the bridge was constructed was [[Ramat Gan]].  Zvi Bar, Ramat Gan's mayor and head of the city planning division which issued construction permits, was a member of the Maccabiah committee which helped select Irgunit.  Bar apparently did not ensure that Irgunit, Karagula, or Ben-Ezra obtained the necessary permit and made no effort to ensure that the bridge as constructed was safe.<ref>Zycher</ref>

==Criminal trial==
Based on the findings of the Dotan and police investigations, Israel's attorney general [[Elyakim Rubinstein]] brought criminal charges against Eyal, Mishori, Karagula, Ben-Ezra, and Bar-Ilan for [[Criminal negligence|causing death by negligence]] and for building without proper permits.<ref>Beck; Segal, "Maccabiah bridge collapse blame..."; Segal, "Israeli court convicts five..."; Tal, p. 3; ''Xinhua'', "5 Israelis convicted...".</ref>  On March 15, 1998 in Tel Aviv [[Israeli judicial system#Magistrate courts|Magistrate Court]] all five pleaded not guilty.  Final arguments in the trial were presented in October 1999.<ref>''New York Times'', "5 Deny Guilt..."; ''Xinhua'', "5 Israelis convicted...".</ref>

On April 17, 2000 the three judge panel of the court found all five defendants guilty of causing death by negligence.<ref>''Xinhua'', "5 Israelis convicted...".</ref>  The defendants were sentenced on June 5, 2000.  Bar-Ilan was sentenced to one year and nine months in prison, plus a suspended sentence of 21 months.  Ben-Ezra and Kargula were given 15-months in prison, plus suspended sentences of two years.  Mishori received nine months in prison, plus a suspended sentence of 15-months.  Eyal was sentenced to six months of community service.<ref>''Xinhua'', "Five Israelis sentenced..."</ref>
