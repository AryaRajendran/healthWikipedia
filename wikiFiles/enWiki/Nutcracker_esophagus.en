[[Image:Peristaltic.jpg|right|thumb|Time space graph of normal [[peristalsis]].  '''Nutcracker esophagus''' shows higher amplitude contractions (Z-axis) that take longer to pass (X-axis)]]
'''Nutcracker esophagus''' is a disorder of the movement of the [[esophagus]], and is one of many [[motility]] disorders of the esophagus, including [[achalasia]] and [[esophageal spasm|diffuse esophageal spasm]].  It causes difficulty swallowing, or [[dysphagia]], to both solid and liquid foods, and can cause [[chest pain]]; it may also be asymptomatic.  Nutcracker esophagus can affect people of any age, but is more common in the 6th and 7th decades of life.  The diagnosis is made by an [[esophageal motility study]] (esophageal manometry), which evaluates the pressure of the esophagus at various points along its length.  The term "nutcracker esophagus" comes from the finding of increased pressures during [[peristalsis]], with a diagnosis made when pressures exceed 180 mmHg; this has been likened to the pressure of a mechanical [[nutcracker]].  The disorder does not progress, and is not associated with any complications; as a result, treatment of nutcracker esophagus targets control of symptoms only.<ref name=Castell>{{cite journal | author = Tutuian R, Castell D | title = Esophageal motility disorders (distal esophageal spasm, nutcracker esophagus, and hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter): modern management | journal = Curr Treat Options Gastroenterol | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 283–94 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16836947 | doi = 10.1007/s11938-006-0010-y}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
Nutcracker esophagus is characterized as a [[motility]] disorder of the [[esophagus]], meaning that it is caused by abnormal movement, or [[peristalsis]] of the esophagus.<ref name=Castell/>  Patients with motility disorders are present with two key symptoms: either with ''[[chest pain]]'' (typically reported as non-cardiac chest pain as it is esophageal in origin), which is usually found in disorders of spasm, or with ''[[dysphagia]]'' (difficulty with swallowing).  Nutcracker esophagus can present with either of these, but chest pain is the more common presentation.<!--

==Diagnosis==
In patients who have [[dysphagia]], testing may first be done to exclude an anatomical cause of dysphagia, where there is a distortion of the anatomy of the [[esophagus]].  This usually includes visualization of the [[esophagus]] with an [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy|endoscope]], and can also include [[barium swallow]] x-rays of the esophagus.<!--

-->Endoscopy is typically normal in patients with nutcracker esophagus; however, abnormalities associated with [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]], or GERD, which associates with nutcracker esophagus, may be seen.<ref name=Bjorkman/>  Barium swallow in nutcracker esophagus is also typically normal <ref name=Castell/> but may provide a definitive diagnosis if contrast is given in tablet or granule form. Studies on [[endoscopic ultrasound]] show slight trend toward thickening of the [[esophagus|muscularis propria]] of the esophagus in nutcracker esophagus, but this is not useful in making the diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Melzer E, Ron Y, Tiomni E, Avni Y, Bar-Meir S | title = Assessment of the esophageal wall by endoscopic ultrasonography in patients with nutcracker esophagus | journal = Gastrointest Endosc | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 223–5 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9378208 | doi = 10.1016/S0016-5107(97)70090-7}}</ref>

===Esophageal motility studies===
[[Image:Nutcracker manometry.jpg|right|thumb|Diagram of esophageal motility study in '''nutcracker esophagus'''.  The disorder shows [[peristalsis]] with high pressure esophageal contractions exceeding 180 mmHg and contractile waves with a long duration exceeding 6 seconds.]]
The diagnosis of nutcracker esophagus is typically made with an [[esophageal motility study]], which shows characteristic features of the disorder.  Esophageal motility studies involve pressure measurements of the esophagus after a patient takes a wet (fluid-containing) or dry (food-containing) [[swallow]].  Measurements are usually taken at various points in the esophagus.<ref name=Canguidelines/>

Nutcracker esophagus is characterized by a number of criteria described in the literature.  The most commonly used criteria are the ''Castell criteria'', named after American gastroenterologist D.O. Castell.  The Castell criteria include one major criterion: a mean peristaltic amplitude in the distal esophagus of more than 180&nbsp;mm Hg.  The minor criterion is the presence of repetitive contractions (meaning 2 or more) that are greater than six seconds in duration.  Castell also noted that the [[lower esophageal sphincter]] relaxes normally in nutcracker esophagus, but has an elevated pressure of greater than 40&nbsp;mm Hg at baseline.<ref name=Castell/><ref name=Canguidelines/> <!--
   --><ref name=Ott>{{cite journal | author = Ott D | title = Motility disorders of the esophagus | journal = Radiol Clin North Am | volume = 32 | issue = 6 | pages = 1117–34 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7972703}}</ref><ref name=Pilhall>{{cite journal | author = Pilhall M, Börjesson M, Rolny P, Mannheimer C | title = Diagnosis of nutcracker esophagus, segmental or diffuse hypertensive patterns, and clinical characteristics | journal = Dig Dis Sci | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 1381–8 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12064816 | doi = 10.1023/A:1015343119090}}</ref><!--
-->

Three other criteria for definition of the nutcracker esophagus have been defined.  The ''Gothenburg'' criterion consists of the presence of peristaltic contractions, with an amplitude of 180&nbsp;mm Hg at any place in the esophagus.<ref name=Bjorkman/><ref name=Pilhall/>  The ''Richter'' criterion involves the presence of peristaltic contractions with an amplitude of greater than 180 mmHg from an average of measurements taken 3 and 8 centimetres above the lower esophageal sphincter.<!--

-->It has been incorporated into a number of clinical guidelines for the evaluation of dysphagia.<ref name=Pilhall/>  The ''Achem criteria'' are more stringent criteria that are an extension of the study of 93 patients used by Richter and Castell in the development of their criteria, and require amplitudes of greater than 199&nbsp;mm Hg at 3&nbsp;cm above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), greater than 172&nbsp;mm Hg at 8&nbsp;cm above the LES, or greater than 102&nbsp;mm Hg at 13&nbsp;cm above the LES.<ref name=Pilhall/><!--

==Pathophysiology==
Pathology specimens of the esophagus in patients with nutcracker esophagus show no significant abnormality, unlike patients with [[achalasia]] where destruction of the [[Auerbach's plexus]] is seen.  This has led to the thought the pathophysiology of nutcracker esophagus may be related to abnormalities in neurotransmitters or other mediators in the distal esophagus.  Abnormalities in [[nitric oxide]] levels, which have been seen in [[achalasia]] are postulated as the primary abnormality.<ref name=Castell/><ref name=Kahrilas>{{cite journal | author = Kahrilas P | title = Esophageal motility disorders: current concepts of pathogenesis and treatment | journal = Can J Gastroenterol | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 221–31 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10758419}}</ref>  As GERD is associated with nutcracker esophagus, it has also been hypothesized that the alterations in nitric oxide and other released chemicals may be response to reflux.<ref name=Pilhall/>

==Treatment==
Nutcracker esophagus is a benign, non-progressive condition, meaning that it is not associated with significant complications.  Patients are usually reassured by their physicians that the disease is unlikely to worsen.  However, the symptoms of chest pain and dysphagia may be severe enough to require treatment with medications, and, rarely, surgery.

The initial step of treatment focuses on reducing risk factors.  While weight reduction may be useful in reducing symptoms, the role of acid suppression therapy to reduce esophageal reflux, is still uncertain.<ref name=PPI/>  With regard to home treatment, some patients find that drinking extremely cold ice water at the first onset of symptoms can stop an attack.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  Very cold and very hot beverages may trigger esophageal spasms.<ref name=MedlinePlus>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000289.htm |title=Esophageal spasm: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-01-15}}</ref><ref name=MedlinePlus/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/tc/esophageal-spasm-topic-overview |title=Esophageal Spasm Causes, Symptoms, Treatments, and More |publisher=Webmd.com |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=2013-01-15}}</ref>

Medical therapy for nutcracker esophagus includes the use of [[calcium-channel blocker]]s, which relax the LES and palliate the dysphagia symptoms.  [[Diltiazem]] has been used in randomized control studies with good effect.  Nitrate medications, including [[isosorbide dinitrate]], given before meals may also help relax the LES and improve symptoms.<ref name=Castell/>  The inexpensive generic combination of [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]] and [[phenobarbital]] (Donnatal and other brands) may be taken three times daily as a tablet to prevent attacks or, for patients with only occasional episodes, as an [[elixir]] at the onset of symptoms.  [[Phosphodiesterase inhibitors]], such as [[sildenafil]] have also been tried in case series for treatment.<ref name=Castell/>  However, there are no controlled studies of its effectiveness for this indication and it is extremely expensive.  Finally, [[trazodone]], an anti-depressant that reduces visceral sensitivity, has also been shown to reduce chest pain symptoms in patients with nutcracker esophagus.  

Endoscopic therapy with [[botulinum toxin]], known also as Botox, can also be used to temporarily improve symptoms but the effect is temporarily and may only last for weeks.  Finally, pneumatic [[esophageal dilatation|dilatation]] of the esophagus, which is an endoscopic technique where a high-pressure balloon is used to stretch the muscles of the LES, can be performed to improve symptoms

===Surgery===
In patients who have no response to medical or endoscopic therapy, surgery can be performed.  A [[Heller myotomy]] involves an incision to disrupt the LES and the [[myenteric plexus]] that innervates it.  The Heller myotomy is used as a final treatment option in patients who do not respond to other therapies.
