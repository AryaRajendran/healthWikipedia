'''Bennett's fracture''' is a [[fracture]] of the base of the [[first metacarpal bone]] which extends into the [[carpometacarpal joint|carpometacarpal]] (CMC) joint.<ref>{{GPnotebook|1288699906|Bennett's fracture-subluxation}}</ref> This [[joint|intra-articular]] fracture is the most common type of fracture of the [[thumb]], and is nearly always accompanied by some degree of [[subluxation]] or frank [[Joint dislocation|dislocation]] of the carpometacarpal joint.

==Nomenclature==
The Bennett's fracture is named after [[Edward Hallaran Bennett]], Professor of Surgery (1837–1907) at Trinity College of the [[University of Dublin]], who described it in 1882. Bennett said his fracture "passed obliquely across the base of the bone, detaching the greater part of the articular surface, and "the separated fragment was very large and the deformity that resulted there-from seemed more a dorsal subluxation of the first metacarpal".<ref name=Bennett>Bennett EH. Fractures of the Metacarpal Bones. Dublin Med Sci J. 1882;73:72-75.</ref>

==Mechanism of injury==
The Bennett's fracture is an oblique intraarticular metacarpal fracture dislocation, caused by an [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Other directional terms|axial]] force directed against the partially [[Flexion|flexed]] metacarpal. This type of compression along the metacarpal bone is often sustained when a person [[Punch (combat)|punches]] a hard object, such as the [[human skull|skull]] or [[tibia]] of an opponent, or a wall. It can also occur as a result of a fall onto the thumb. This is a common injury sustained from bike falls, as the thumb is generally extended while around the handle bars.

==Significance and complicating factors==
Many important activities of daily life are dependent on the ability to grasp, pinch, and oppose the thumb. In fact, thumb function constitutes about 50% of overall hand function. These abilities are in turn dependent on an intact and functional thumb CMC joint. The CMC joint of the thumb allows a wide range of motion while maintaining stability for grasp and pinch.

With this in mind, failure to properly recognize and treat the Bennett's fracture will not only result in an unstable, painful, arthritic CMC joint with diminished range of motion: it will also result in a hand with greatly diminished overall function.

In the case of the Bennett's fracture, the [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] metacarpal fragment remains attached to the anterior oblique [[ligament]], which in turn is attached to the [[Tubercle (anatomy)|tubercle]] of the [[Trapezium (bone)|trapezium]] bone of the CMC joint. This ligamentous attachment ensures that the proximal fragment remains in its correct [[anatomical position]].

The [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Proximal and distal|distal]] fragment of the first metacarpal bone possesses the majority of the [[articular surface]] of the first CMC joint. Unlike the proximal fracture fragment, strong ligaments and muscle [[tendon]]s of the hand tend to pull this fragment out of its correct anatomical position.

Specifically:
* tension from the [[abductor pollicis longus muscle]] (APL) subluxates the fragment in a [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Dorsal_and_ventral|dorsal]], [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Relative directions in the limbs|radial]], and [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] direction
* tension from the APL rotates the fragment into [[supination]]
* tension from the [[adductor pollicis]] muscle (ADP) displaces the metacarpal head into the [[Hand|palm]]

Tension from the APL and ADP muscles frequently leads to displacement of the fracture fragments, even in cases where the fracture fragments are initially in their proper anatomic position. Because of the aforementioned [[Biomechanics|biomechanical]] features, Bennett's fractures nearly always require some form of intervention to ensure healing in the correct anatomical position and restoration of proper function of the thumb CMC joint.

==Controversy==
Some authors have recently made the assertion that the widely held belief that the APL tendon is a deforming force on the Bennett fracture is incorrect.<ref>[http://www.tulaneorthopaedics.com/Downloads/OllieEdmundsPublishesBookChapter.pdf Traumatic Dislocations and Instability of the Trapeziometacarpal Joint of the Thumb] Edmunds JO. Hand Clin Volume 22, pp. 365–392, 2006.</ref>

==Symptoms and signs==
[[Symptom]]s of Bennett's fracture are '''instability of the CMC joint of the thumb, accompanied by pain and weakness of the pinch grasp.''' Characteristic [[Medical sign|signs]] include pain, swelling, and [[ecchymosis]] around the base of the thumb and [[thenar eminence]], and especially over the CMC joint of the thumb. Physical examination demonstrates instability of the CMC joint of the thumb. The patient will often manifest a weakened ability to grasp objects or perform such tasks as tying shoes and tearing a piece of paper. Other complaints include intense pain experienced upon catching the thumb on an object, such as when reaching into a pants pocket.

==Treatment==
Though these fractures commonly appear quite subtle or even inconsequential on [[Radiography|radiographs]], they can result in severe long-term dysfunction of the hand if left untreated. In his original description of this type of fracture in 1882, Bennett stressed the need for early diagnosis and treatment in order to prevent loss of function of the thumb CMC joint, which is critical to the overall function of the hand.<ref name="Bennett"/>

* In the most minor cases of Bennett's fracture, there may be only small avulsion fractures, relatively little joint instability, and minimal subluxation of the CMC joint (less than 1&nbsp;mm). In such cases, closed reduction followed by immobilization in a [[Orthopedic_cast##Spica_cast|thumb spica cast]] and serial radiography may be all that is required for effective treatment.<ref>Soyer AD. Fractures of the base of the first metacarpal: current treatment options. J Am Acad Orthop Surg. Nov-Dec 1999;7(6):403-12.</ref>

* For Bennett's fractures where there is between 1&nbsp;mm and 3&nbsp;mm of displacement at the trapeziometacarpal joint, closed reduction and percutaneous pin fixation (CRPP) with [[Kirschner wire]]s is often sufficient to ensure a satisfactory functional outcome. The wires are not employed to connect the two fracture fragments together, but rather to secure the first or second metacarpal to the trapezium.

* For Bennett's fractures where there is more than 3&nbsp;mm of displacement at the trapeziometacarpal joint, [[Open reduction internal fixation|open reduction and internal fixation]] (ORIF) is typically recommended.

Regardless of which approach is employed (nonsurgical, CRPP, or ORIF), immobilization in a cast or thumb spica splint is required for four to six weeks.

==Prognosis==
If intraarticular trapeziometacarpal fractures (such as the Bennett's or [[Rolando fracture|Rolando]] fractures) are allowed to heal in a displaced position, significant post-traumatic [[osteoarthritis]] of the base of the thumb is virtually assured.<ref>Foster RJ and Hastings H. Treatment of Bennett, Rolando, and vertical intraarticular trapezial fractures. 2d Clin Orthop. Volume 2140, pp. 121-9, January 1987.</ref> Some form of surgical treatment (typically either a CRPP or a ORIF) is nearly always recommended to ensure a satisfactory outcome for these fractures, if there is signicant displacement.

The long-term outcome after surgical treatment appears to be similar, whether the CRPP or the ORIF approach is used. Specifically, the overall strength of the affected hand is typically diminished, and post-traumatic osteoarthritis tends to develop in almost all cases. The degree of weakness and the severity of osteoarthritis does however appear to correlate with the quality of reduction of the fracture. Therefore, the goal of treatment of Bennett's fracture should be to achieve the most precise reduction possible, whether by the CRPP or the ORIF approach.<ref>Á Timmenga EJ, Blokhuis TJ, Maas M. Raaijmakers EL. Long-term evaluation of Bennett's fracture: a comparison between open and closed reduction. Journal of Hand Surgery - British Volume. 19(3):373-7, 1994.</ref>
