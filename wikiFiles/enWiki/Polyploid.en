'''Polyploid''' [[biological cell|cells]] and [[organism]]s are those containing more than two paired ([[Homologous chromosome|homologous]]) sets of [[chromosomes]]. Most [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] species are [[diploid]], meaning they have two sets of chromosomes — one set inherited from each parent. However '''polyploidy''' is found in some organisms and is especially common in plants. In addition, polyploidy also occurs in some tissues of animals who are otherwise diploid, such as human [[muscle]] tissues.<ref name="pmid19571289">{{cite journal | author = Parmacek MS, Epstein JA | title = Cardiomyocyte renewal | journal = N.

([[Ploidy|Monoploid]] organisms also occur; a monoploid has only one set of chromosomes.  These include the vast majority of [[prokaryotes]].)

Polyploidy refers to a numerical change in a whole set of chromosomes. Organisms in which a particular chromosome, or chromosome segment, is under- or overrepresented are said to be [[Aneuploidy|aneuploid]] (from the Greek words meaning "not," "good," and "fold"). Therefore the distinction between aneuploidy and polyploidy is that aneuploidy refers to a numerical change in part of the chromosome set, whereas polyploidy refers to a numerical change in the whole set of chromosomes.<ref name="isbn0-7167-3520-2">{{cite book | author = Griffiths, Anthony J.

Polyploidy may occur due to abnormal [[cell division]], either during [[mitosis]], or commonly during [[meiosis#Metaphase I|metaphase I]] in [[meiosis]].

Polyploidy occurs in some [[animal]]s, such as [[goldfish]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ohno S, Muramoto J, Christian L, Atkin NB |title=Diploid-tetraploid relationship among old-world members of the fish family ''Cyprinidae'' |journal=Chromosoma |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |year=1967 |doi=10.1007/BF00293307 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n3rr5m124g728271/ }}</ref> [[salmon]], and [[salamander]]s, but is especially common among [[fern]]s and flowering [[plant]]s (see ''[[Hibiscus rosa-sinensis]]''), including both wild and cultivated [[species]]. [[Wheat]], for example, after millennia of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] and modification by humans, has strains that are '''diploid''' (two sets of chromosomes), '''tetraploid''' (four sets of chromosomes) with the common name of [[durum]] or macaroni wheat, and '''hexaploid''' (six sets of chromosomes) with the common name of bread wheat. Many agriculturally important plants of the genus ''[[Brassica]]'' are also tetraploids. Polyploidization is a mechanism of [[sympatric speciation]] because polyploids are usually unable to interbreed with their diploid ancestors.

Polyploidy can be induced in plants and [[cell culture]]s by some chemicals: the best known is [[colchicine]], which can result in chromosome doubling, though its use may have other less obvious consequences as well. [[Oryzalin]] also will double the existing chromosome content.

===Polyploidy in humans===
{{further|Triploid syndrome}}

True polyploidy rarely occurs in humans, although it occurs in some tissues (especially in the liver). [[Aneuploidy]] is more common.

Polyploidy occurs in humans in the form of triploidy, with 69 chromosomes (sometimes called 69,XXX), and tetraploidy with 92 chromosomes (sometimes called 92,XXXX). Triploidy, usually due to [[polyspermy]], occurs in about 2–3% of all human pregnancies and ~15% of miscarriages.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The vast majority of triploid conceptions end as [[miscarriage]] and those that do survive to term typically die shortly after birth. In some cases survival past birth may occur longer if there is [[mixoploidy]] with both a [[diploid]] and a triploid cell population present.

Triploidy may be the result of either [[digyny]] (the extra haploid set is from the mother) or [[diandry]] (the extra haploid set is from the father). Diandry is mostly caused by reduplication of the paternal haploid set from a single sperm, but may also be the consequence of dispermic (two sperm) [[fertilization]] of the egg.<ref name="Ten Teachers">{{cite book | author = Baker, Phil; Monga, Ash; Baker, Philip | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Gynaecology by ten teachers | edition = | language = | publisher = Arnold | location = London | year = 2006 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-340-81662-7 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> Digyny is most commonly caused by either failure of one meiotic division during oogenesis leading to a diploid [[oocyte]] or failure to extrude one [[polar body]] from the [[oocyte]]. Diandry appears to predominate among early [[miscarriage]]s while digyny predominates among triploidy that survives into the fetal period.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} However, among early miscarriages, digyny is also more common in those cases <8.5 weeks gestational age or those in which an embryo is present. There are also two distinct [[phenotype]]s in triploid [[placenta]]s and [[fetus]]es that are dependent on the origin of the extra [[haploid]] set. In digyny there is typically an asymmetric poorly grown [[fetus]], with marked [[adrenal]] [[hypoplasia]] and a very small [[placenta]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} In diandry, a partial [[hydatidiform mole]] develops.<ref name="Ten Teachers" /> These parent-of-origin effects reflect the effects of [[imprinting (genetics)|genomic imprinting]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Complete tetraploidy is more rarely diagnosed than triploidy, but is observed in 1–2% of early miscarriages. However, some tetraploid cells are commonly found in chromosome analysis at [[prenatal diagnosis]] and these are generally considered 'harmless'. It is not clear whether these tetraploid cells simply tend to arise during ''in vitro'' cell culture or whether they are also present in placental cells ''in vivo''. There are, at any rate, very few clinical reports of fetuses/infants diagnosed with tetraploidy mosaicism.

[[Mixoploidy]] is quite commonly observed in human preimplantation embryos and includes haploid/diploid as well as diploid/tetraploid mixed cell populations. It is unknown whether these embryos fail to implant and are therefore rarely detected in ongoing pregnancies or if there is simply a selective process favoring the diploid cells.

===Polyploid crops===
The induction of polyploidy is a common technique to overcome the sterility of a hybrid species during plant breeding. For example, [[Triticale]] is the hybrid of wheat (''Triticum turgidum'') and [[rye]] (''Secale cereale''). It combines sought-after characteristics of the parents, but the initial hybrids are sterile. After polyploidization, the hybrid becomes fertile and can thus be further propagated to become triticale.

In some situations polyploid crops are preferred because they are sterile. For example many seedless fruit varieties are seedless as a result of polyploidy. Such crops are propagated using asexual techniques such as grafting.

Polyploidy in crop plants is most commonly induced by treating seeds with the chemical [[Colchicine#Botanical use|colchicine]].

In addition, polyploidy is frequently associated with [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] and reticulate evolution that appear to be highly prevalent in several fungal taxa.

Other eukaryotic [[taxon|taxa]] have experienced one or more polyploidization events during their evolutionary history (see Albertin and Marullo, 2012<ref name=Albertin12/> for review).

==Terminology==

=== Autopolyploidy ===
Autopolyploids are polyploids with multiple chromosome sets derived from a single species. Autopolyploids can arise from a spontaneous, naturally occurring [[genome]] doubling, like the potato.<ref name="Consortium The Potato Genome Sequencing 2011 189–195"/> Others might form following fusion of 2n [[gametes]] (unreduced gametes). Bananas and apples can be found as autotriploids. Autopolyploid plants typically display polysomic inheritance, and are therefore often infertile and propagated clonally perfect.

===Allopolyploidy===
Allopolyploids are polyploids with chromosomes derived from different species. Precisely it is the result of multiplying the chromosome number in an F1 hybrid. ''[[Triticale]]'' is an example of an allopolyploid, having six chromosome sets, allohexaploid, four from wheat (''Triticum turgidum'') and two from rye (''Secale cereale''). ''Amphidiploids'' are a type of allopolyploids (they are tetraploid, containing the diploid chromosome sets of both parents<ref>{{cite book|author=Rieger, R.; Michaelis, A.; Green, M.M. |year=1968 |title= A glossary of genetics and cytogenetics: Classical and molecular}}</ref>). Some of the best examples of allopolyploids come from the [[Brassicas]], and the [[Triangle of U]] describes the relationships among the three common diploid Brassicas (''B. oleracea, B. rapa,'' and ''B. nigra'') and three allotetraploids (''B. napus, B. juncea,'' and ''B. carinata'') derived from hybridization among the diploids.

===Paleopolyploidy===
[[File:PaleopolyploidyTree.jpg|right|thumb|300px|This [[phylogenetic tree]] shows the relationship between the best-documented instances of [[paleopolyploidy]] in eukaryotes.]]

{{Main|Paleopolyploidy}}
Ancient genome duplications probably occurred in the evolutionary history of all life. Duplication events that occurred long ago in the history of various [[Lineage (evolution)|evolutionary lineages]] can be difficult to detect because of subsequent diploidization (such that a polyploid starts to behave cytogenetically as a diploid over time) as [[mutation]]s and gene translations gradually make one copy of each chromosome unlike its other copy.

In many cases, these events can be inferred only through comparing [[DNA sequencing|sequenced genomes]]. Examples of unexpected but recently confirmed ancient genome duplications include [[baker's yeast]] (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''), mustard weed/thale cress (''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''), [[rice]] (''[[Oryza sativa]]''), and an early [[evolution]]ary [[ancestor]] of the [[vertebrates]] (which includes the [[human]] lineage) and another near the origin of the [[teleost]] [[fishes]]. [[Angiosperms]] ([[flowering plants]]) have paleopolyploidy in their ancestry. All [[eukaryote]]s probably have experienced a polyploidy event at some point in their evolutionary history.

===Karyotype===
{{Main|Karyotype}}
A karyotype is the characteristic [[chromosome]] complement of a [[eukaryote]] [[species]].<ref>White M.J.D. 1973. ''The chromosomes''. 6th ed, Chapman & Hall, London. p28</ref><ref>Stebbins G.L. 1950. ''Variation and evolution in plants''. Chapter XII: The Karyotype. Columbia University Press N.Y.</ref> The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of [[cytopathology|cytology]] and, more specifically, [[cytogenetics]].

Although the replication and transcription of DNA is highly standardized in [[eukaryotes]], the same cannot be said for their karotypes, which are highly variable between species in chromosome number and in detailed organization despite being constructed out of the same macromolecules. In some cases there is even significant variation within species. This variation provides the basis for a range of studies in what might be called evolutionary cytology.

===Paralogous===
The term is used to describe the relationship among duplicated genes or portions of chromosomes that derived from a common ancestral DNA. Paralogous segments of DNA may arise spontaneously by errors during [[DNA replication]], copy and paste [[transposons]], or whole genome duplications.

===Homologous===
The term is used to describe the relationship of similar chromosomes that pair at [[mitosis]] and [[meiosis]]. In a diploid, one homolog is derived from the male parent (sperm) and one is derived from the female parent (egg). During meiosis and [[gametogenesis]], homologous chromosomes pair and exchange genetic material by [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], leading to the production of sperm or eggs with chromosome [[haplotypes]] containing novel genetic variation.

===Homoeologous===
The term ''homoeologous'', also spelled ''homeologous'', is used to describe the relationship of similar chromosomes or parts of chromosomes brought together following inter-species hybridization and allopolyploidization, and whose relationship was completely homologous in an ancestral species. In allopolyploids, the homologous chromosomes within each parental sub-genome should pair faithfully during [[meiosis]], leading to disomic inheritance; however in some allopolyploids, the homoeologous chromosomes of the parental genomes may be nearly as similar to one another as the homologous chromosomes, leading to tetrasomic inheritance (four chromosomes pairing at meiosis), intergenomic [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], and reduced fertility.

====Example of homoeologous chromosomes====
[[Durum#Genealogy|Durum wheat]] is the result of the inter-species hybridization of two diploid grass species ''Triticum urartu'' and ''Aegilops speltoides''. Both the diploid ancestors had two sets of 7 chromosomes, which were similar in terms of size and genes contained on them. Durum wheat contains two sets of chromosomes derived from ''Triticum urartu'' and two sets of chromosomes derived from ''Aegilops speltoides''. Each chromosome pair derived from the ''Triticum urartu'' parent is '''homoeologous''' to the opposite chromosome pair derived from the ''Aegilops speltoides'' parent, though each chromosome pair unto itself is '''homologous'''.
