'''Hydrops fetalis''' is a [[disease|condition]] in the [[fetus]] characterized by an accumulation of fluid, or [[edema]], in at least two fetal compartments.<ref name="urlHydrops Fetalis: eMedicine Pediatrics: Cardiac Disease and Critical Care Medicine">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/974571-overview |title=Hydrops Fetalis: eMedicine Pediatrics: Cardiac Disease and Critical Care Medicine |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-02-11}}</ref> By comparison, hydrops allantois or hydrops amnion are an accumulation of excessive fluid in the [[allantois|allantoic]] or [[amniotic sac|amniotic space]] respectively.<ref name="urlEquine stud farm medicine and surgery">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uVaQTJwuyUQC&pg=PA298&dq=hydrops+amnion&hl=en&ei=9XjpTPXtKca2hAexy6kQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=hydrops%20amnion&f=false |title=Equine stud farm medicine and surgery |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-02-11}}</ref>

==Presentation==

Locations can include:

* [[subcutaneous tissue]]/[[scalp]]
* [[pleura]] ([[pleural effusion]])
* [[pericardium]] ([[pericardial effusion]])
* [[abdomen]] ([[ascites]])

The [[edema]] is usually seen in the fetal [[subcutaneous]] tissue, sometimes leading to [[spontaneous abortion]].  It is a prenatal form of [[heart failure]], in which the heart is unable to satisfy its demand for a high amount of blood flow.

==Classification and causes==
Hydrops fetalis usually stems from fetal [[anemia]], when the heart needs to pump a much greater volume of blood to deliver the same amount of oxygen.  This anemia can have either an '''immune''' or '''non-immune''' cause.  Non-immune hydrops can also be unrelated to anemia, for example if a tumor or [[congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation]] increases the demand for blood flow.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The increased demand for cardiac output leads to heart failure, and corresponding edema.

===Immune causes===
*[[Rh disease]] is a cause for immune mediated hydrops fetalis; however, owing to preventative methods developed in the 1970s Rh disease has markedly declined.  [[Rh disease]] can be prevented by administration of anti-D IgG ([[Rho(D) Immune Globulin]]) injections to RhD-negative mothers during pregnancy and/or within 72 hours of the delivery. However a small percentage of pregnant mothers are still susceptible to Rh disease even after having been administered anti-D IgG (Rho(D) Immune Globulin)

===Non-Immune causes===
The non-immune form of hydrops fetalis has many causes including:  
*[[Iron deficiency anemia]]
*[[Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia]] resulting in [[heart failure]]
*Deficiency of the enzyme [[beta-glucuronidase]].  This enzyme deficiency is the cause of the [[lysosomal storage disease]] called [[Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VII]].
*Congenital disorders of glycosylation
*[[Parvovirus B19]] (Fifth Disease) infection of the pregnant woman.
*[[Cytomegalovirus]] in mother.
*Maternal [[syphilis]].
*[[Alpha-thalassemia|α thalassemia]] can also cause hydrops fetalis when all four of the genetic loci for α globin are deleted or affected by mutation.  This is termed Hb Barts (consists of y-4 tetramers).
*Uncommonly, [[Niemann-Pick Disease]]  Type C (NPC) and [[Gaucher Disease]] type 2 can present with hydrops fetalis.
*[[Turner Syndrome]]
* [[Tumor]]s,<ref name="pmid18075961">{{cite journal |author=Isaacs H |title=Fetal hydrops associated with tumors |journal=Am J Perinatol |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=43–68 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18075961 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-1004826 |url=http://www.thieme-connect.com/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2007-1004826}}</ref> the most common type of fetal tumor being [[teratoma]], particularly a [[sacrococcygeal teratoma]].
* [[Twin-twin transfusion syndrome]] in monochorionic pregnancy (hydrops affects the recipient twin)
* Maternal [[hyperthyroidism]]

==Diagnosis==
Hydrops fetalis can be diagnosed and monitored by [[Obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasound]] scans. Prenatal ultrasound scanning enables early recognition of hydrops fetalis and has been enhanced with the introduction of MCA Doppler.

==Treatment==
{{expand section|date=August 2010}}
The treatment depends on the cause.  

Severely [[anemic]] fetuses can be treated with [[blood transfusions]] while still in the womb.
