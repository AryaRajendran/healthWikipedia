'''Urinary retention''', also known as '''ischuria''', is a lack of ability to [[urinate]]. It is a common complication of [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH), though it can also be caused by:
* [[Nerve]] dysfunction
* [[Tethered spinal cord syndrome]]
* [[Constipation]]
* [[Infection]]
* [[Medications]] (including [[anticholinergic]]s, [[antidepressant]]s, [[COX-2 inhibitor]]s,<ref>http://www.healthywomen.org/resources/womenshealthinthenews/dbhealthnews/nsaidpainkillersmayraiseurinaryretentionrisk</ref> [[amphetamine]]s and [[opiates]]). 

Diagnosis and treatment may require a [[urinary catheterization|catheter]] or [[prostatic stent]].

== Signs and symptoms ==
Urinary retention is characterised by poor urinary stream with intermittent flow, straining, a sense of incomplete voiding, and hesitancy (a delay between trying to urinate and the flow actually beginning). As the bladder remains full, it may lead to [[urinary incontinence|incontinence]], [[nocturia]] (need to urinate at night), and high frequency. Acute retention causing complete [[anuria]] is a medical emergency, as the bladder can stretch to enormous sizes and possibly tear if not dealt with quickly. If the bladder distends enough it becomes painful. The increase in bladder pressure can also prevent urine from entering the ureters or even cause urine to pass back up the ureters and get into the kidneys, causing [[hydronephrosis]], and possibly [[pyonephrosis]], kidney failure, and sepsis. A person should go straight to an emergency department or [[Emergency department|A&E service]] as soon as possible if unable to urinate with a painfully full bladder.

== Causes ==
In the bladder
* [[Bladder sphincter dyssynergia|Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia]]
* Neurogenic bladder (commonly pelvic splanchic nerve damage, cauda equina syndrome, descending cortical fibers lesion, pontine micturation or storage center lesions, [[demyelinating diseases]] or [[Parkinson's disease]])
* [[Iatrogenesis|Iatrogenic]] (caused by medical treatment/procedure) scarring of the bladder neck (commonly from removal of indwelling [[catheters]] or [[cystoscopy]] operations)
* Damage to the bladder
In the prostate
* [[Benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH)
* [[Prostate cancer]] and other pelvic [[cancer|malignancies]]
* [[Prostatitis]]
Penile urethra
* Congenital urethral valves
* [[Phimosis]] or pinhole meatus
* [[Circumcision]]
* Obstruction in the urethra, for example a metastasis or a precipitated pseudogout crystal in the urine
* STD lesions (gonorrhoea causes numerous strictures, leading to a "rosary bead" appearance, whereas chlamydia usually causes a single stricture)
Other
* [[Tethered spinal cord syndrome]]
* [[Paruresis]] ("shy bladder syndrome")- in extreme cases, urinary retention can result
* Consumption of some [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive substances]], mainly [[stimulant]]s, such as [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA]] and [[amphetamine]].
* Use of NSAIDs or drugs with [[anticholinergic]] properties.
* Stones or metastases can theoretically appear anywhere along the urinary tract, but vary in frequency depending on anatomy
* [[Muscarinic antagonist]] such as [[Atropine]] and [[Scopolamine]]
[[Paruresis]], inability to urinate in the presence of others (such as in a public restroom), may also be classified as a type of urinary retention, although it is psychological rather than biological.

Brain
*[[Mental retardation]]

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Urinaryobstruction.png|thumb|As seen on axial CT]]
[[Urine flow tests]] may aid in establishing the type of [[micturition]] (urination) abnormality. Common findings, determined by ultrasound of the bladder, include a slow rate of flow, intermittent flow, and a large amount of urine retained in the bladder after urination. A normal test result should be 20-25 mL/sec peak flow rate. A post-void residual urine greater than 50 ml is a significant amount of urine and increases the potential for recurring urinary tract infections. In adults older than 60 years, 50-100 ml of residual urine may remain after each voiding because of the decreased contractility of the [[Detrusor urinae muscle|detrusor muscle]]. In  chronic retention, ultrasound of the bladder may show massive increase in bladder capacity (normal capacity is 400-600 ml).

Determining the serum [[prostate-specific antigen]] (PSA) may help diagnose or rule out prostate cancer, though this is also raised in BPH and prostatitis. A TRUS biopsy of the prostate (trans-rectal ultra-sound guided) can distinguish between these prostate conditions.  Serum [[urea]] and [[creatinine]] determinations may be necessary to rule out backflow kidney damage.  Cystoscopy may be needed to explore the urinary passage and rule out blockages.

In acute cases of urinary retention where associated symptoms in the lumbar spine are present such as pain, numbness (saddle anesthesia), parasthesias, decreased anal sphincter tone, or altered deep tendon reflexes, an MRI of the lumbar spine should be considered to further assess [[Cauda equina syndrome|Cauda Equina Syndrome]].

== Complications ==
Urinary retention often occurs without warning. It is basically the inability to pass [[urine]]. In some people, the disorder starts gradually but in others it may appear suddenly. Acute urinary retention is a [[medical emergency]] and requires prompt treatment. The pain can be excruciating when urine is not able to flow out. Moreover one can develop severe [[perspiration|sweating]], [[chest pain]], [[anxiety]] and [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]. Other patients may develop a shock like condition and may require admission to a hospital. It is not unusual for an individual to develop a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] after suffering acute urinary retention. Other more serious complications of untreated urinary retention include [[urinary bladder|bladder]] damage and chronic [[renal failure|kidney failure]].<ref>[http://www.retentionurinary.com/ General information on urinary retention] 2010-02-10</ref> Urinary retention is a disorder treated in a hospital, and the quicker one seeks treatment, the fewer the complications.

In the longer term, obstruction of the urinary tract may cause:
* [[Bladder stone]]s
* [[Atrophy]] of the [[detrusor muscle]] (atonic bladder is an extreme form)
* [[Hydronephrosis]] (congestion of the kidneys)
* [[Hypertrophy]] of the [[detrusor muscle]] (the muscle that squeezes the bladder to empty it during urination)
* [[Diverticula]] (formation of pouches) in the bladder wall (which can lead to stones and infection)

== Treatment ==

In acute urinary retention, [[urinary catheterization]], placement of a [[prostatic stent]] or [[suprapubic cystostomy]] relieves the retention. In the longer term, treatment depends on the cause. BPH may respond to [[alpha blocker]] and [[5-alpha-reductase inhibitor]] therapy, or surgically with [[prostatectomy]] or [[transurethral resection of the prostate]] (TURP).  Older patients with ongoing problems may require continued intermittent [[self catheterization]].<ref>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003972.htm</ref>  5-alpha-reductase inhibitor increase the chance of normal urination following catheter removal.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zeif HJ, Subramonian K |title=Alpha blockers prior to removal of a catheter for acute urinary retention in adult men |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD006744 |year=2009 |pmid=19821385 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006744.pub2 |url=}}</ref>

=== Complications===
The acute urinary retention is treated by placement of a urinary catheter (small thin flexible tube) into the bladder. This can be either an [[intermittent catheter]] or a [[Foley catheter]] that is emplaced with a small inflatable bulb that holds the catheter in place.  

Intermittent catheterization can be done by a health care professional (nurse/ doctor) or by the patient himself /herself (clean intermittent self catheterization).  Intermittent catheterization performed at the hospital is a sterile technique performed by nurses or doctors. Patients can be taught to use a [[self catheterization]]<ref>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003972.htm</ref> technique in one simple demonstration, and that reduces the rate of infection from long-term Foley catheters.  Self catheterization requires doing the procedure every 3 or 4 hours 4-6 times a day. The [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] form of urinary retention may require some type of [[surgery|surgical]] procedure. While both procedures are relatively safe, complications can occur.

For acute urinary retention, treatment requires urgent placement of a urinary catheter (tube) through the [[urethra]] and into the bladder. These catheters are usually inserted by health care professionals. However, if the procedure is not done in a [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] fashion, it can introduce [[bacteria]] into the bladder. This can result in an infection of the entire urinary tract. Therefore, sterile technique is a must when inserting a [[Foley catheter]].  Careful washing of hands, [[meatus]], and reusable catheters are also necessary with clean self catheterization techniques.<ref>University of Michigan Health System. [http://health.med.umich.edu/healthcontent.cfm?xyzpdqabc=0&id=6&action=detail&AEProductID=HW_Knowledgebase&AEArticleID=hw60259 "Transurethral Resection of the Prostate"] 2010-02-10.</ref>

A permanent urinary catheter may cause discomfort and pain that can last several days. The urinary catheter must be placed into the bladder and not near the [[prostate]] gland. Placement of the catheter near the prostate can lead to significant [[irritation]] and some bleeding.
In most patients with [[benign prostate hyperplasia]] (BPH), a procedure known as [[transurethral resection of the prostate]] (TURP) is performed to relieve bladder obstruction. The surgeon performs the procedure with a small lighted instrument inserted into the urethra under anesthesia. The surgeon can core out the enlarged prostate and relieve obstruction. However, the procedure has risks. There are risks of anesthesia which may include [[allergy]] to medications or [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] from [[spinal anesthesia]].<ref>eMedicine Health. [http://www.emedicinehealth.com/inability_to_urinate/article_em.htm "Inability to urinate"] 2010-02-10.</ref>

Surgical complications from TURP include a bladder infection, bleeding from the prostate, scar formation, inability to hold urine, and inability to have an erection. The majority of these complications are short lived, and most individuals recover fully within 6–12 months.<ref>National kidney and urologic diseases information clearinghouse. [http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/UrinaryRetention/index.htm "Urinary retention overview"] 2010-02-10.</ref>
Some people with BPH are treated with medications like [[finasteride]] or [[dutasteride]] to decrease prostate enlargement. The drugs only work for mild cases of BPH but also have mild side effects. Some of the medications decrease [[libido]] and may cause [[dizziness]], fatigue and [[lightheadedness]]. Unfortunately, medications only work in less than 5 percent of individuals with BPH.<ref>[http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/men/prostate/148.html What is benign prostatic hyperplasia?] Family Doctor online portal.

== Epidemiology ==
Urinary retention is a common disorder in elderly males. The most common cause of urinary retention is BPH. This disorder starts around age 50 and symptoms may appear after 10–15 years. BPH is a progressive disorder and narrows the neck of the bladder leading to urinary retention. By the age of 70, almost 10 percent of males have some degree of BPH and 33% have it by the eighth decade of life. While BPH rarely causes sudden urinary retention, the condition can become acute in the presence of certain medications ([[blood pressure]] pills, anti [[histamine]]s, [[antiparkinson]] medications), after [[spinal anaesthesia]] or stroke.

In young males, the most common cause of urinary retention is infection of the prostate (''acute [[prostatitis]]''). The infection is acquired during sexual intercourse and presents with low back pain, penile discharge, low grade [[fever]] and an inability to pass urine. The exact numbers of individuals with acute prostatitis is unknown, because many do not seek treatment. In the USA, at least 1-3 percent of males under the age of 40 develop urinary difficulty as a result of acute prostatitis. Most physicians and other health care professionals are aware of these disorders. Worldwide, both BPH and acute prostatitis have been found in males of all races and ethnic backgrounds. Cancers of the urinary tract can cause urinary obstruction but the process is more gradual. [[Bladder cancer|Cancer of the bladder]], [[Prostate cancer|prostate]] or [[Ureter cancer|ureters]] can gradually obstruct urine output. Cancers often present with [[Hematuria|blood in the urine]], [[weight loss]], lower back pain or gradual distension in the flanks.<ref>[http://www.urologychannel.com/emergencies/acute.shtml Urologic Emergencies] Urology Channel portal. 2010-02-10</ref>
