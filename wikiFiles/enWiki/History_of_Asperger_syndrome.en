[[Asperger syndrome]] (AS), an [[autism spectrum disorder]] (ASD), is a relatively new diagnosis in the field of [[autism]].<ref name="What'sSpecial">{{cite journal |author=Baron-Cohen S, Klin A |title=What's so special about Asperger Syndrome? |journal=Brain and cognition |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |year=2006 |pmid=16563588 |doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2006.02.002|url=http://www.elsevier.com/authored_subject_sections/S05/S05_360/pdf/klin.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> It was named in honor of [[Hans Asperger]] (1906–80), an Austrian [[psychiatrist]] and [[pediatrician]]. An English psychiatrist, [[Lorna Wing]], popularized the term "Asperger's syndrome" in a 1981 publication; the first book in English on Asperger syndrome was written by [[Uta Frith]] in 1991 and the condition was subsequently recognized in formal diagnostic manuals later in the 1990s.<ref name="What'sSpecial"/>

== Discovery of autistic psychopathy ==
Asperger was the director of the University Children's Clinic in Vienna, spending most of his professional life in Vienna and publishing largely in German.<ref name="What'sSpecial"/> As a child, Asperger appeared to have exhibited some features of the very condition named after him, such as social remoteness and talent in language;<ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2007 |title=Did Hans Asperger (1906–1980) have Asperger Syndrome? |author=Lyons V, Fitzgerald M |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0382-4 |pmid=17917805 |volume=37 |issue=10 |pages=2020–1 }}</ref> photographs taken during his seminal work show that he had a frank and earnest face with an intense gaze.<ref>{{cite book |author=Osborne L |title=American Normal: The Hidden World of Asperger Syndrome |publisher=Copernicus |year=2002 |isbn=0-387-95307-8 |page=19}}</ref> In 1944, Asperger described in the paper "'Autistic psychopathy' in childhood"<ref name=ha/> four children in his practice<ref name=Baskin>{{cite journal |author= Baskin JH, Sperber M, Price BH |title= Asperger syndrome revisited |journal= Rev Neurol Dis |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16596080}}</ref> who had difficulty in integrating themselves socially. Although their intelligence appeared normal, the children lacked nonverbal communication skills, failed to demonstrate empathy with their peers, and were physically clumsy. Their speaking was either disjointed or overly formal, and their all-absorbing interest in a single topic dominated their conversations. Asperger called the condition "autistic psychopathy" and described it as primarily marked by [[social isolation]].<ref name=NINDS>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) (July 31, 2007).

They fulfil their role well, perhaps better than anyone else could, and we are talking of people who as children had the greatest difficulties and caused untold worries to their care-givers."<ref name=ha/>

== Relationship to Kanner's work ==
Two subtypes of autism were described between 1943 and 1944 by two Austrian researchers working independently—Asperger and Austrian-born child psychiatrist [[Leo Kanner]] (1894–1981). Kanner emigrated to the United States in 1924;<ref name="What'sSpecial"/> he described a similar syndrome in 1943, known as "classic autism" or "[[Autism|Kannerian autism]]", characterized by significant cognitive and communicative deficiencies, including delayed or absent [[language development]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Kanner L |title= Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal= Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–50 |year=1943 |authorlink= Leo Kanner}} Reprint (1968) ''Acta Paedopsychiatr'' 35 (4): 100–36.

According to Ishikawa and Ichihashi in the ''Japanese Journal of Clinical Medicine'', the first author to use the term ''Asperger's syndrome'' in the English-language literature was the German physician, Gerhard Bosch.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ishikawa G, Ichihashi K |title=[Autistic psychopathy or pervasive developmental disorder: how has Asperger's syndrome changed in the past sixty years?] |language=Japanese |journal=Nippon Rinsho |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=409–18 |year=2007 |pmid=17354550}}</ref> Between 1951 and 1962, Bosch worked as a psychiatrist at [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt University]]. In 1962, he published a monograph detailing five case histories of individuals with PDD<ref>{{de icon}} Bosch G (1962). Der frühkindliche Autismus - eine klinische und

[[Lorna Wing]] is credited with widely popularizing the term "Asperger's syndrome" in the English-speaking medical community in her 1981 publication<ref>{{cite journal |author= Wing L |title= Asperger's syndrome: a clinical account |journal= Psychol Med |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=115–29 |year=1981 |doi=10.1017/S0033291700053332 |pmid=7208735 |url=http://www.mugsy.org/wing2.htm |accessdate=2007-08-15 }}</ref> of a series of case studies of children showing similar symptoms.<ref name="What'sSpecial"/> Wing also placed AS on the autism spectrum, although Asperger was uncomfortable characterizing his patient on the continuum of autistic spectrum disorders.<ref name="Baskin"/> She chose "Asperger's syndrome" as a neutral term to avoid the misunderstanding equated by the term ''autistic psychopathy'' with sociopathic behavior.<ref name="Mattila"/> Wing's publication effectively introduced the diagnostic concept into American psychiatry and renamed the condition as Asperger's;<ref name="McPartland">{{cite journal |author= McPartland J, Klin A |title= Asperger's syndrome |journal= Adolesc Med Clin |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=771–88 |year=2006 |pmid=17030291 |doi=10.1016/j.admecli.2006.06.010 |doi_brokendate=2008-06-22}}</ref> however, her accounts blurred some of the distinctions between Asperger's and Kanner's descriptions because she included some mildly retarded children and some children who presented with [[language delay]]s early in life.<ref name="Klin"/>

==Early studies==
The first systematic studies appeared in the late 1980s in publications by Tantam (1988) in the UK, Gillberg and Gilbert in Sweden (1989), and Szatmari, Bartolucci and Bremmer (1989) in North America.<ref name="What'sSpecial"/> The diagnostic criteria for AS were outlined by Gillberg and Gillberg in 1989; Szatmari also proposed criteria in 1989.<ref name="Mattila">{{cite journal |author=Mattila ML |title=An epidemiological and diagnostic study of Asperger syndrome according to four sets of diagnostic criteria |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=636–46 |year=2007 |pmid=17450055 |doi=10.1097/chi.0b013e318033ff42 |author-separator=, |author2=Kielinen M |author3=Jussila K |display-authors=3 |last4=Linna |first4=Sirkka-Liisa |last5=Bloigu |first5=Risto |last6=Ebeling |first6=Hanna |last7=Moilanen |first7=Irma}}</ref> Asperger's work became more widely available in English when [[Uta Frith]], an early researcher of Kannerian autism, translated his original paper in 1991.<ref name="What'sSpecial"/> AS became a distinct diagnosis in 1992, when it was included in the 10th published edition of the [[World Health Organization]]’s diagnostic manual, International Classification of Diseases ([[ICD-10]]); in 1994, it was added to the fourth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-IV]]) as ''Asperger's Disorder''.<ref name=NINDS/>

==Contemporary==
Less than two decades after the widespread introduction of AS to English-speaking audiences, there are hundreds of books, articles and websites describing it; prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS recognized as an important subgroup.<ref name="What'sSpecial"/> However, questions remain concerning many aspects of AS; whether it should be a separate condition from [[high-functioning autism]] is a fundamental issue requiring further study.<ref name="Baskin"/> The [[Diagnosis of Asperger syndrome|diagnostic validity of Asperger syndrome is tentative]], there is little consensus among clinical researchers about the usage of the term "Asperger's syndrome", and there are questions about the empirical validation of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria.<ref name="Klin"/> It is likely that the definition of the condition will change as new studies emerge<ref name="Klin"/> and it will eventually be understood as a multifactorial heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder involving a catalyst that results in prenatal or perinatal changes in brain structures.<ref name="Baskin"/>

There is uncertainty regarding the gender gap between males and females with AS. A person with Asperger's is often remarked as possessing masculine traits like emotional distance from the inability to empathize, and far more boys than girls are diagnosed with Asperger's.<ref name="Flora">{{cite news|url=http://psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-20061103-000002.html|title=An Aspie in the City|author=Flora, Carlin|work=Psychology Today|date=Nov/Dec 2006
|accessdate=2008-08-19}}</ref> Most studies on the syndrome were derived from research on males, neglecting specific attention to females with AS who often go misdiagnosed. For the most part, studies on girls with Asperger's are anecdotal.<ref name="Flora"/>

==Proposed changes in DSM-5==

One of the [[DSM-5#Proposed changes to DSM-IV diagnoses|proposed changes]] in [[DSM-5]] that is set to be released in May 2013 is to eliminate Asperger syndrome as a separate diagnosis, and [[DSM-5#Asperger_syndrome|fold it under autism spectrum disorders]]. Under the proposed changes, ASD will be rated on a scale ranging from severe, through moderate, to mild, based on clinical presentation.<ref>{{cite news |title=A powerful identity, a vanishing diagnosis |author=Wallis C |work=New York Times |date=2009-11-02 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/health/03asperger.html }}</ref>
