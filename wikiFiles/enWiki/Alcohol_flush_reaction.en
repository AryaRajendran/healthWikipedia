'''Alcohol flush reaction''' (also known as '''Asian flush syndrome''', '''Asian flush''', '''Asian glow''', among others) is a condition in which an individual's face or body experiences flushes or blotches as a result of an accumulation of [[acetaldehyde]], a metabolic byproduct of the catabolic metabolism of alcohol.  

This syndrome has been associated with an increased risk of [[esophageal cancer]] in those who drink.<ref>[http://www.nih.gov/news/health/mar2009/niaaa-23.htm Alcohol Flush Signals Increased Cancer Risk among East Asians] March 23, 2009 News Release - [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH)</ref> It has also been associated with lower than average rates of alcoholism, possibly due to its association with adverse effects after drinking alcohol.<ref name="Yi Peng, Hong Shi, Xue-bin Qi, Chun-jie Xiao, Hua Zhong, Run-lin Z Ma, Bing Su 2010 15">{{cite journal |author=Yi Peng, Hong Shi, Xue-bin Qi, Chun-jie Xiao, Hua Zhong, Run-lin Z Ma, Bing Su |title=The ADH1B Arg47His polymorphism in East Asian populations and expansion of rice domestication in history |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=10 |pages= 15|year=2010 |pmid=20089146 |pmc=2823730 |doi= 10.1186/1471-2148-10-15|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/15}}</ref>

Flushing, or blushing, is associated with the [[erythema]] (reddening caused by dilation of capillaries) of the face, neck, shoulder, and in some cases, the entire body after consumption of alcohol.

==Causes==

It is commonly thought that the flush reaction is caused by an inability to metabolize alcohol. To the contrary, around 80% of Asian people (less common in Thailand and India) have a variant of the gene coding for the enzyme [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] called [[ADH1B]], and almost all Chinese and Korean people have a variant of the gene called [[ADH1C]].<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17718397</ref> These [[genes]] result in an alcohol dehydrogenase [[enzyme]] which converts alcohol to acetaldehyde with a much higher efficiency than other gene variants (40 to 100-fold in case of ADH1B).<ref name="Yi Peng, Hong Shi, Xue-bin Qi, Chun-jie Xiao, Hua Zhong, Run-lin Z Ma, Bing Su 2010 15"/> In about 50% of Asians, the increased acetaldehyde accumulation is worsened by another gene variant, the [[mitochondria]]l ALDH2 allele, which results in an inhibited [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]] enzyme, responsible for the breakdown of acetaldehyde.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/> The result is that affected people may be better at metabolizing alcohol, often not feeling the alcohol "buzz" to the same extent as others, but show far more acetaldehyde-based side effects while drinking.

==Genetics==
Alcohol flush reaction is best known as a condition that is experienced by people of Asian descent. According to the analysis by [[HapMap]] project, the rs671 allele of the ALDH2 gene responsible for the flush reaction is rare among Europeans and Africans, and it is very rare among Mexican-Americans. 30% to 50% of people of Chinese and Japanese ancestry have at least one ALDH*2 allele.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs671|title=Rs671}}</ref> The rs671 form of ALDH2, which accounts for most incidents of alcohol flush reaction worldwide, is native to East Asia and most common in southeastern China. It most likely originated among Han Chinese in central China,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Refined Geographic Distribution of the Oriental ALDH2*504Lys (nee 487Lys) Variant|author=Hui Li et al|journal=Ann Hum Genet|year=2009|pmc=2846302|pmid=19456322|doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.2009.00517.x|volume=73|issue=Pt 3|pages=335–45}}</ref> and it appears to have been positively selected in the past. Another analysis correlates the rise and spread of rice cultivation in Southern China with the spread of the allele.<ref name="Yi Peng, Hong Shi, Xue-bin Qi, Chun-jie Xiao, Hua Zhong, Run-lin Z Ma, Bing Su 2010 15"/> The reasons for this positive selection aren't known, but it's been hypothesized that elevated concentrations of acetaldehyde may have conferred protection against certain parasitic infections, such as ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Oota et al|title=The evolution and population genetics of the ALDH2 locus: random genetic drift, selection, and low levels of recombination|year=2004|journal=Annals of Human Genetics}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Research has shown that a history of facial flushing when drinking is indicative of ALDH2 deficiency, and that an ALDH2-deficient drinker who drinks two beers per day has six to ten times the risk of developing [[esophageal cancer]] as a drinker not deficient in the enzyme.<ref name="nyt">[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/health/24blush.html?ref=science Drinkers’ Red Face May Signal Cancer Risk ], [[New York Times]], March 23, 2009</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Brooks PJ, Enoch M-A, Goldman D, Li T-K, Yokoyama A |title=The Alcohol Flushing Response: An Unrecognized Risk Factor for Esophageal Cancer from Alcohol Consumption |journal=Public Library of Science Medicine |volume=6 |issue=3 |year=2009 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000050 |url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000050 |pmid=19320537 |pmc=2659709 |pages=e50}}</ref>

==Treatment and prevention==
Some sufferers feel that ingestion of low doses of heartburn medicine, containing [[ranitidine]] or [[famotidine]] (such as Zantac or Pepcid AC), may be able to relieve the body of the symptoms if taken 30–60 minutes before drinking. This has not been a subject of scientific study, and was popularized by [[word of mouth]] communication.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2007-04-24/haynie-asianglow|author=Haynie D|title=Asian party-goers strive to get rid of that 'glow' often caused by the first drink|date=2007-04-27}}</ref> Ranitidine has been proven in studies to significantly increase [[blood alcohol content]] levels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/news/20000215/zantac-alcohol-dont-mix |title=Zantac and Alcohol Don't Mix |deadurl=no |accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref> Care should be given before driving or operating heavy machinery.

Since the mutation is a genetic issue, there is no cure for the flush reaction.

Several hypotheses exist on the true nature of the flush. Unfortunately due to the lack of randomized controlled studies, none has been proven in humans.

One hypothesis that may explain the effects of famotidine (and similar classed drugs) on the skin erythema or redness secondary to alcohol consumption (or rather, the lack thereof) is because the drugs are H2-antagonists or H2 antihistamines, which are used to treat peptic/gastric ulcers. However, H2-antagonists do not actually reduce blood concentrations of histamine, but rather work by blocking the effect of histamine on the H2 receptor, and so this theory is disputed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Another hypothesis is that acetaldehyde causes the redness and vasodilation, and because the [[Histamine H2 receptor|H2-antagonist]] class of medicine inhibits the ADH enzyme (the conversion from ethanol to acetaldehyde) both in the GI tract and in the liver,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Joan Caballería, et al. |title=Effects of H2-receptor antagonists on gastric alcohol dehydrogenase activity |journal=Digestive Diseases and Sciences |volume=36 |issue=12 |pages=1673–1679 |year=1991 |doi=10.1007/BF01296608 |pmid=1684149}}</ref> the conversion happens at a much slower pace, reducing the effects acetaldehyde has on the drinker. The idea that acetaldehyde is the cause of the flush is also shown by the clinical use of [[disulfiram]] (Antabuse), which blocks the removal of acetaldehyde from the body via ALDH inhibition. The high acetaldehyde concentrations described share similarity to symptoms of the flush (flushing of the skin, accelerated heart rate, shortness of breath, throbbing headache, mental confusion and blurred vision).<ref>Wright C, Moore RD (June 1990). "Disulfiram treatment of alcoholism". Am. J. Med. 88 (6): 647–55. {{doi|10.1016/0002-9343(90)90534-K}}. PMID 2189310.</ref>

Although many people with this condition view it as a lifetime inconvenience, some people have suggested that they can condition their body to be more tolerant of alcohol with repeated, moderate drinking, perhaps increasing the concentration of ALDH2 to metabolize acetaldehyde. Unfortunately, acetaldehyde is a known carcinogen; recent research suggests that alcohol flush-afflicted individuals consuming alcohol continually may be at a higher risk for alcohol-related diseases, such as liver and esophageal cancers and digestive tract cancer.<ref name=SB>{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2000/A/200000156.html |title=Can heavy alcohol use lead to some kinds of cancer? |work=Science Blog |deadurl=no |accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref>

Studies in pinto rats have also shown that consumption of carbohydrates ([[glucose]] and [[fructose]]) significantly increase the metabolism of ethanol through a yet unknown pathway, and without affecting alcohol dehydrogenase activity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Keegan A, Batey R |title=Dietary carbohydrate accelerates ethanol elimination, but does not alter hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase |journal=Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=431–3 |year=1993 |pmid=8488989 |doi= 10.1111/j.1530-0277.1993.tb00789.x|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0145-6008&date=1993&volume=17&issue=2&spage=431}}</ref>

==Other effects==
Individuals who experience the alcohol flushing reaction may be less prone to [[alcoholism]]. [[Disulfiram]], a drug sometimes given as treatment for alcoholism, works by inhibiting [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]], causing a five to tenfold increase in the concentration of acetaldehyde in the body. The resulting irritating flushing reaction is intended to discourage alcoholics from drinking.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a682602.html |title=Disulfiram |work=MedlinePlus Drug Information |deadurl=no |accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{EMedicine|emerg|151|Toxicity, Disulfiram}}</ref>  

Persons prone to the condition also have lower blood pressure, perhaps as a result of their much lower levels of drinking alcohol.<ref>http://www.healthnewstrack.com/health-news-414.html</ref>

For measuring the level of flush reaction to alcohol, the most accurate method is to determine the level of acetaldehyde in the blood stream. This can be measured through both a breathalyzer test or a blood test.<ref>http://www.criticalimprov.com/index.php/surg/article/viewArticle/982/</ref> Additionally, measuring the amount of alcohol metabolizing enzymes [[alcohol dehydrogenases]] and [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] through genetic testing can predict the amount of reaction that one would have. More crude measurements can be made though measuring the amount of redness in the face of an individual after consuming alcohol. Computer and phone applications can be used to standardize this measurement.

Other effects include "nausea, headache and general physical discomfort."<ref>http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/fall-2009/esophageal-cancer-and-the-‘asian-glow’</ref>

==Other similar conditions==
*[[Rosacea]], also known as gin blossoms, is  a chronic facial skin condition in which capillaries are excessively reactive, leading to redness from flushing or telangiectasia. Rosacea has been mistakenly attributed to alcoholism because of its similar appearance to the temporary flushing of the face that often accompanies the ingestion of alcohol.
*Degreaser's flush—a flushing condition arising from consuming alcohol shortly before or during inhalation of [[trichloroethylene]] (TCE), an organic solvent with suspected carcinogenic properties.
*[[Carcinoid syndrome]] – episodes of severe flushing precipitated by alcohol, stress and certain foods.  May also be associated with diarrhea, wheezing and weight loss.
