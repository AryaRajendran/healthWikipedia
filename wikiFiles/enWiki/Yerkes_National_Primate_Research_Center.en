The '''Yerkes National Primate Research Center''' in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], is the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]'s primate research branch. It is one of eight national [[primate]] research centers funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]].  It is known for its biomedical and behavioral studies with nonhuman [[primates]].

Its {{convert|25|acre|adj=on}} "Main Station" contains most of the center's biomedical research laboratories. The center also includes the {{convert|117|acre|adj=on}} Yerkes Field Station near [[Lawrenceville, Georgia]].

==History==
The center was established in 1930 by [[Robert Yerkes]], in [[Orange Park, Florida]].  Yerkes was a pioneering [[primatologist]] who specialized in [[comparative psychology]].

In 1965 it relocated to its present location at 201 Dowman Drive, [[Atlanta, Georgia]],  on the campus of [[Emory University]].<ref>http://www.yerkes.emory.edu/</ref> 

==Satellite locations==
The "Field Station" houses 3,400 animals, specializes in behavioral studies of primate social groups, and is located 30 miles (50&nbsp;km) northeast of Atlanta, on 117 acres (473,000 mÂ²) of wooded land, off Webb Gin House Road, near [[Lawrenceville, Georgia]]. The "Living Links Center" is a semi-free ranging primate research center at Yerkes National Primate Research Center. It is run by primatologist [[Frans De Waal]] and has two socially housed groups of capuchin monkeys and two socially housed groups of chimpanzees.<ref>[http://www.emory.edu/LIVING_LINKS/ Living Links Center].

==Research==
[[Multidisciplinary]] [[medical research]] at the Yerkes research center is primarily aimed at development of [[vaccines]] and medical treatments.  Research programs include [[cognitive development]] and decline, childhood [[visual]] defects, [[organ transplant]]ation, the [[behavior]]al effects of [[hormone]] replacement therapy and [[social]] [[behavior]]s of primates.  Yerkes researchers also are leading programs to better understand the aging process, pioneer [[organ transplant]] procedures and provide safer drugs to organ transplant recipients, determine the behavioral effects of [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]], prevent early onset [[vision disorders]] and shed light on [[Evolutionary neuroscience|human behavioral evolution]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Researchers have had success creating transgenic rhesus macaque monkeys with [[Huntington's disease]] and hope to breed a second generation of macaques with the genetic disorder.<ref>{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Jason|title=Glowing monkeys 'to aid research|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8070252.stm|newspaper=BBC News|date=27 May 2009}}</ref>

==Controversy==
{{Criticism section|date=January 2013}}

Yerkes has long been the target of protest for its treatment of animals. This was especially true after the release of [[Frederick Wiseman]]'s 1974 film ''[http://zipporah.com/films/32 Primate]'', which was shot at Yerkes and which revealed the uncaring, routinized treatment of animals undergoing painful physical procedures and even vivisection. 

Yerkes' proposal to do AIDS-related research on endangered [[Sooty Mangabey]] monkeys drew opposition from numerous primatologists, including [[Jane Goodall]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Goodall opposes AIDS research on monkeys: Primate expert urges government to reject use of endangered animals|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/13484021/|newspaper=Associated Press|date=22 June 2006}}</ref>  In 2007 Yerkes was fined for unsanitary conditions and poor procedures leading to the death of a macaque monkey.

OSHA, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], ultimately fined the center $105,300 in 1998, after a 19-week investigation(OSHA).<ref>http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/
1998/May/ermay.4/5_4_98Yerkes.html</ref> The event lead to reforms in safety protocols for handling research primates. 

On June 15, 2011, at the '''Yerkes National Primate Research Center Field Station''', in [[Gwinnett County, Georgia]] personnel determined that Ep13, a non-infected female rhesus macaque was missing<ref>http://www.yerkes.emory.edu/about/news/rhesus_062311.html.</ref><ref>http://www.ajc.
com/news/calls-come-in-about-985776.html</ref> On August 16, 2011, the search for Ep13 ended.
