'''Bernhard Rudolf Konrad von Langenbeck''' (9 November 1810 – 29 September 1887) was a German [[surgery|surgeon]] known as the developer of [[Langenbeck's amputation]] and founder of ''[[Langenbeck's Archives of Surgery]]''.
==Life==
He was born at [[Padingbüttel]], and received his medical education at [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], where one of his teachers was his uncle [[Konrad Johann Martin Langenbeck]]. He took his doctorate in 1835 with a thesis on the structure of the [[retina]]. After a visit to France and England, he returned to Göttingen as ''[[Privatdozent]]'', and in 1842 became Professor of Surgery and Director of the [[Friedrichs Hospital]] at [[Kiel]]. Six years later he succeeded [[Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach]] (1794–1847) as Director of the Clinical Institute for Surgery and Ophthalmology at the [[Charité]] in Berlin, and remained there till 1882, when failing health forced him to retire. He died at [[Wiesbaden]] in September 1887.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Langenbeck was a bold and skillful surgeon, but preferred not to operate while other means afforded a prospect of success. He specialised in [[Battlefield medicine|military surgery]] and became an authority on the treatment of <!-- In anticipation of an article replacing the redirect, don't bypass the redirect to: --> [[gunshot wound]]s. He served as general field-surgeon of the army in the [[First Schleswig War]] in 1848 and saw active service in the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864, the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866, and the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71. He was in [[Orléans]] at the end of 1870 after the city had been taken by the [[Prussia]]ns and in his capacity as surgeon or as consultant tended to the wounded men with whom every public building was packed. He also utilized the opportunities for instruction that thus arose, and the [[Militär-ärztliche Gesellschaft]], which met twice a week for some months, and in the discussions of which every surgeon in the city, irrespective of nationality, was invited to take part, was mainly formed by his energy and enthusiasm. He was ennobled for his services in the [[Danish War of 1864]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

von Langenbeck is perhaps best known today as the "father of the surgical residency".  Under his tutellage at the Charite in Berlin, he conceived and developed a system whereby new medical graduates would live at the hospital as they gradually assumed a greater role in the day-to-day care and supervision of surgical patients.  Among his most well-known "house staff" were such illustrious surgeons as [[Billroth]] and [[Emil Theodor Kocher]].  The great achievement of his house-staff model was acknowledged by no less than [[Sir William Osler]] and [[William Halsted]], who quickly co-opted his concept into the teaching system of the Departments of Medicine and Surgery, respectively, at the [[Johns Hopkins University Hospital]] in the late 19th century.
