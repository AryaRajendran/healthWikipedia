An '''antidote''' is a substance which can counteract a form of [[poison]]ing.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000006009|antidote}}.</ref> The term ultimately derives from the Greek αντιδιδοναι ''antididonai'', "given against".

The antidotes for some particular [[toxins]] are manufactured by injecting the toxin into an animal in small doses and extracting the resulting [[antibody|antibodies]] from the host animals' blood. This results in an [[antivenom]] that can be used to counteract [[venom (poison)|poison]] produced by certain species of [[snake]]s, [[spider]]s, and other venomous animals. A number of venoms lack a viable antivenom, and a bite or sting from an animal producing such a toxin often results in death.{{Citation needed|reason=are all poisons that don't have antivenoms lethal, this need sources|date=December 2011}} Some animal venoms, especially those produced by [[arthropod]]s (e.g. certain [[spider]]s, [[scorpion]]s, [[bee]]s, etc.) are only potentially lethal when they provoke allergic reactions and induce [[anaphylactic shock]]; as such, there is no "antidote" for these venoms because it is not a form of poisoning and anaphylactic shock can be treated (e.g., by the use of [[epinephrine]]).

Some other toxins have no known antidote. For example, the poison [[aconitine]], a highly poisonous [[alkaloid]] derived from various [[aconitum|aconite species]] has no antidote, and as a result is often fatal if it enters the human body in sufficient quantities.

==Mechanical approaches==
Ingested poisons are frequently treated by the oral administration of [[activated charcoal]], which [[adsorption|adsorb]]s the poison and flushes it from the digestive tract, thereby removing a large part of the toxin. 
Poisons which are injected into the body (such as those from bites or stings from venomous animals) are usually treated by the use of a constriction band which limits the flow of lymph and/or blood to the area, thus slowing circulation of the poison around the body.  This should not be confused with use of a [[tourniquet]] which cuts off blood flow completely - often leading to the loss of the limb.
