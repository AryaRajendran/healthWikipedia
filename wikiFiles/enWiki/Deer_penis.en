In [[traditional Chinese medicine]], a deer [[penis]] ({{zh|c=鹿鞭|p=lù biān}}) is said to have important therapeutic properties. 

==Purported properties==
The deer penis is typically very large and, proponents claim, for it to retain its properties it must be extracted from the deer while still alive.<ref name="Angang">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pwu0bFjopW0C&pg=PA98&dq=Deer+penis&hl=en&ei=xP4hTPy1LYmXsQaUxvHlBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Deer%20penis&f=false|author=Stafford, Charles|title=The roads of Chinese childhood: learning and identification in Angang|work=Volume 97 of Cambridge studies in social and cultural anthropology|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=98|year=1995|isbn=0-521-46574-5}}</ref> Often it is then sliced into small pieces, typically by women and then roasted and dried in the sun.<ref name="Angang"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Richards, John F|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=i85noYD9C0EC&pg=PA99&dq=Deer+penis&hl=en&ei=IgkiTKDCAceVsQaczc3lBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Deer%20penis&f=false|title=The Unending Frontier: An Environmental History of the Early Modern World|work=Volume 1 of California World History Library|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=0-520-24678-0|year=2006|page=99}}</ref> In [[Angang, Taiwan|Angang]], [[Taiwan]], women are reported as consuming deer penis during pregnancy as it is said to have a fattening effect and to make the mother and child stronger.<ref name="Angang"/>

The Mayans were also known to extract the penis of the deer and roast it.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert M.

During the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], the country banned deer penis, turtle blood, and [[angelica root]] potions from athletes' diets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aCQ0IoTLiM.4&refer=home|title=Deer Penis Loses Favor as China's Olympians Fear Drug Testers |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=March 23, 2008|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}</ref> This is because according to traditional Chinese medicine, deer penis, especially if ingested while soaked in alcohol ('''deer penis wine'''), is an effective remedy for athletic injuries. Chinese Olympic officials advised national athletes not to take the traditional remedy because it may contain some banned substances like the stimulant herbal [[ephedrine]]. It joined steroids and amphetamines on the list of banned substances. When consumed, a deer penis or [[tiger penis]] is also said to enhance virility, and is thought by some to be an [[aphrodisiac]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Harding, Andrew|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/5371500.stm|title=Beijing's penis emporium|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=September 23, 2006|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}</ref>
