The '''1970 British Cohort Study''' (BCS70) is a continuing, multi-disciplinary [[longitudinal survey]] monitoring the development of babies born in the UK in one particular week in April 1970.

==History==
Since the start of the BCS70, seven full sets of data have been collected in 1970, 1975, 1980, 1986, 1996, 1999/2000 and 2004/2005. An eighth survey is taking place in 2012, with the participants at age 42.

The first wave in 1970, called the [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&sitesectionid=810&sitesectiontitle=BCS+1970 British Births Survey], was conducted by the [http://www.wellbeingofwomen.org.uk/research/national-birthday-trust-fund/ National Birthday Trust Fund] together with the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] in order to collect information to compare with those of the [[National Child Development Study]] (NCDS). The following two sweeps in 1975 and 1980, when the study was known as the [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&sitesectionid=803&sitesectiontitle=BCS+1975 Child Health and Education Study] (CHES), were carried out by the Department of Child Health at Bristol University. The 1986 survey was conducted by the [http://www.longviewuk.com/pages/iccs.shtml International Centre for Child Studies] and called Youthscan which was then taken over for the following surveys by the Social Statistics Research Unit (SSRU), now known as the [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk Centre for Longitudinal Studies] (CLS).<ref>[http://www.esds.ac.uk/longitudinal/access/bcs70/l33229.asp ESDS Longitudinal, BCS70 dataset guide], retrieved September 17, 2009.

The scope of the BCS70 has been broadened in the course of the different surveys. While the focus was on medical aspects at birth, factors such as physical, educational, social and economic development were subsequently taken into account.<ref>[http://www.esds.ac.uk/findingData/snDescription.asp?sn=5585&amp;key=/&amp;flag=true Economic and Social Data Service (ESDS), BC70 catalogue record entry], retrieved September 17, 2009</ref>

==Methodology and scope==
The primary method of data collection cnsists of face-to-face interviews (with the parents), self-completion questionnaires and psychological and educational measurements. The sample size included about 17,000 babies in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland born in 1970.<ref>[http://www.esds.ac.uk/findingData/bcs70.asp BCS70 dataset guide], retrieved September 17, 2009</ref>
