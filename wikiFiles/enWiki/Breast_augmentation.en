'''Breast augmentation''' denotes the [[breast implant]] and fat-graft [[mammoplasty]] procedures for correcting the defects, and for enhancing the size, form, and feel of the [[breast]]s of a woman. The surgical implantation approach effects global breast augmentation using either a saline-filled or a silicone-filled prosthetic breast; and it might also consist of corrections effected with transplanted [[TRAM flap|skin flaps]]. The fat-transfer approach effects the augmentation, and corrects the contour defects of the breast hemisphere with grafts of autologous [[Adipose tissue|adipocyte fat tissue]]. Each breast-augmentation approach corrects post–[[mastectomy]] defects in a [[breast reconstruction]] procedure; [[congenital defect]]s, and [[Congenital abnormality|congenital abnormalities]] of the chest wall; and aesthetically enhances the natural size, look, and feel of the bust.

In breast reconstruction practice, the [[Tissue expansion|tissue expander]] is a temporary breast-implant device used to prepare the implant-pocket (recipient site), as part of a staged reconstruction mammoplasty procedure. In non-implant breast augmentation practice, some fat-graft injection approaches feature tissue engineering, which is the pre-operative external tissue expansion of the recipient site. In non-surgical practice, the corrective approaches might consist either of an externally applied vacuum device, which will expand the tissues of the recipient site, or of oral medications; yet, in most instances, the medium-volume, fat-graft augmentation of the breast is limited to one brassière cup-size, or less.

==Surgical breast augmentation==
===Breast implants===
For [[breast reconstruction]] and for the augmentation and aesthetic enhancement of the size, form, and feel of a woman’s [[breast]]s, there are three types of [[breast implant|breast implant devices]]:

# '''saline implants''' filled with sterile [[saline (medicine)|saline solution]]
# '''silicone implants''' filled with viscous [[silicone]] gel
# '''alternative-composition implants''', filled with miscellaneous fillers&nbsp;— [[soy|soy oil]], [[String breast implant|polypropylene string]], et cetera&nbsp;— that are no longer manufactured.

[[Image:Saline-filled breast implants.jpeg|thumb|200px|Breast augmentation: saline-solution filled breast implant devices.]]
;I. — Saline breast implant
The saline breast implant, filled with [[Saline (medicine)|saline solution]] (biological-concentration salt water 0.90% [[Mass concentration (chemistry)|w/v]] of [[sodium chloride|NaCl]], ca. 300 [[Osmolality|mOsm]]/L.), was first manufactured by the Laboratoires Arion company, in France, and was introduced for use as a [[medical device]] in 1964. The contemporary models of saline breast implant are manufactured with thicker, room-temperature [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] (RTV) shells made of a [[silicone]] [[elastomer]]. The study ''In vitro Deflation of Pre-filled Saline Breast Implants'' (2006) reported that the rates of deflation (filler leakage) of the '''pre-filled saline breast implant''' made it a second choice for corrective breast surgery.<ref name="Stevens">{{cite journal|author=Stevens WG, Hirsch EM, Stoker DA, Cohen R.|title=In vitro Deflation of Pre-filled Saline Breast Implants | journal=Plastic Reconstruction Surgery | year=2006|pages=347–349| volume=118|issue=2|pmid=16874200|doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000227674.65284.80}}</ref> Nonetheless, in the 1990s, the saline breast implant was the [[medical device|prosthesis]] usual for breast augmentation, because of the U.S. FDA importation restriction against silicone breast implants.

The technical goal of saline-implant technology was allowing a surgical technique for emplacing an empty breast-implant device through a smaller surgical incision.<ref name="Arion1965">{{cite journal|author=Arion HG|title=Retromammary Prosthesis |journal=C R Societé Française de Gynécologie | year=1965|volume=5}}</ref> In surgical praxis, after having emplaced the empty breast implants into the implant pockets, the plastic surgeon then fills each device with [[Saline (medicine)|saline solution]], and, because the required insertion incisions are small, the resultant incision-scars will be smaller than the surgical scar usual to the long incision required for inserting pre-filled, silicone-gel implants.

Although the saline breast implant can yield good-to-excellent results of breast size, contour, and feel, when compared to silicone-implant results, the saline implant is likelier to cause cosmetic problems such as rippling, wrinkling, and being noticeable to the eye and to the touch. This is especially true for women with very little [[breast]] tissue, and for [[Mastectomy|post-mastectomy]] reconstruction patients; thus, silicone-gel implants are the superior [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] device for breast augmentation and for [[breast reconstruction]]. In the case of the woman with much breast tissue, for whom submuscular emplacement is the recommended surgical technique, saline breast implants can afford an aesthetic “look” of breast size, contour, and feel, much like that afforded by the silicone implant.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Eisenberg, TS | title = Silicone Gel Implants Are Back&nbsp;– So What? | journal = American Journal of Cosmetic Surgery | year = 2009 | volume = 26 | pages = 5–7}}</ref>

[[Image:Silicone gel-filled breast implants.jpeg|thumb|200px|Breast augmentation: Late-generation models of silicone-gel breast implant devices.]]

;II. — Silicone-gel breast implant
The modern '''[[breast implant|prosthetic breast]]''' was invented in 1961, by the American [[Plastic surgery|plastic surgeons]] Thomas Cronin and Frank Gerow, and the [[Dow Corning Corporation]]; in due course, the first augmentation mammoplasty was performed in 1962. There are five generations of the [[medical device]] [[technology]] of the silicone breast implant, each is defined by common model-manufacturing techniques.

;First generation
The '''Cronin–Gerow Implant, prosthesis model 1963''', was a silicone rubber envelope-sac, shaped like a tear-drop, filled with viscous silicone-gel. To reduce the rotation of the emplaced breast-implant upon the chest wall, it was affixed to the implant pocket with a fastener-patch of Dacron material ([[Polyethylene terephthalate]]) attached to the rear of the breast implant shell.<ref name=Cronin_1963>{{cite journal | author = Cronin TD, Gerow FJ | title = Augmentation Mammaplasty: A New "natural feel" Prosthesis | journal = Excerpta Medica International Congress Series | year = 1963 | volume = 66 | page = 41}}</ref>

;Second generation
In the 1970s, the first technological development, a thinner device-shell and a thinner, low-cohesion silicone-gel filler, impoved the functionality and verisimilitude (size, look, and feel) of the silicone breast implant. Yet, in clinical practice, the second-generation proved fragile, and suffered greater incidences of shell rupture, and of “silicone gel bleed” (filler leakage through an intact shell). The consequent, increased incidence-rates of medical complications (e.g. [[capsular contracture]]) precipitated U.S. government faulty-product [[Class action|class action-lawsuits]] against the Dow Corning Corporation, and other manufacturers of prosthetic breast prostheses.

* The second technological development was a '''[[polyurethane]] foam coating''' for the implant shell; it reduced the incidence of [[capsular contracture]] by causing an [[Inflammation|inflammatory reaction]] that impeded the formation of a capsule of fibrous [[collagen]] tissue around the breast implant. Nevertheless, the medical use of polyurethane-coated breast implants was briefly discontinued because of the potential health-risk posed by 2,4-toluenediamine (TDA), a [[carcinogen]]ic by-product of the chemical breakdown of the implant’s polyurethane foam coating.<ref name="Luu11998">{{cite journal | author=Luu HM, Hutter JC, Bushar HF | title=A Physiologically based Pharmacokinetic Model for 2,4-toluenediamine Leached from Polyurethane foam-covered Breast Implants | journal=Environ Health Perspect | year=1998 | pages=393–400 | volume=106 | issue=7 | pmid=9637796 | doi=10.2307/3434066 | pmc=1533137 | jstor=3434066}}</ref> After reviewing the medical data, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] concluded that TDA-induced [[breast cancer]] was an infinitesimal health-risk to women with breast implants, and did not justify legally requiring physicians to explain the matter to their patients. In the event, polyurethane-coated breast implants remain in plastic surgery practice in Europe and in South America; in the U.S., no breast implant manufacturer has sought the FDA’s approval for American medical sale.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Hester TR Jr, Tebbetts JB, Maxwell GP | title=The Polyurethane-covered Mammary Prosthesis: Facts and Fiction (II): A Look Back and a "peek" Ahead | journal=Clinical Plastic Surgery | year=2001 | pages=579–86 | volume=28 | issue=3 | pmid=11471963}}</ref>

* The third technological development was the '''double lumen''' breast-implant, a double-cavity device composed of a silicone-implant within a saline-implant. The two-fold, technical goal was: (i) the cosmetic benefits of silicone-gel (the inner lumen) enclosed in saline solution (the outer lumen); (ii) a breast-implant device the volume of which is post-operatively adjustable. Nevertheless, the more complex design of the double-lumen breast-implant suffered a device-failure rate greater than that of single-lumen breast implants. The contemporary versions of Second generation devices, presented in 1984, are the “Becker Expandable” models of breast implant device, used primarily for [[Reconstructive surgery|breast reconstruction]].

;Third and Fourth generations
In the 1980s, the models of the Third and of the Fourth generations of breast-implant devices were sequential advances in manufacturing technology, e.g. [[elastomer]]-coated shells that decreased gel-bleed (filler leakage), and a thicker filler (increased-cohesion) gel. [[Sociology of health and illness|Sociologically]], the manufacturers then designed and fabricated varieties of anatomic models (natural breast) and shaped models (round, tapered) that realistically corresponded with the breast and body types presented by women patients. The tapered models of breast implant have a uniformly textured surface, to reduce rotation; the round models of breast implant are available in smooth-surface and textured-surface types.

;Fifth generation
Since the mid-1990s, the Fifth generation of silicone breast implant is made of a semi-solid gel that mostly eliminates filler leakage (silicone gel bleed) and silicone migration from the breast to elsewhere in the body. The studies ''Experience with Anatomical Soft Cohesive Silicone gel Prosthesis in Cosmetic and Reconstructive Breast Implant Surgery'' (2004) and ''Cohesive Silicone gel Breast Implants in Aesthetic and Reconstructive Breast Surgery'' (2005) reported low incidence rates of [[capsular contracture]] and of device-shell rupture, improved medical safety and technical efficacy greater than earlier generations of breast implant device.<ref>{{cite pmid|16141814}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|15602249}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|11471959}}</ref>

===Implants and breast-feeding===
The [[breasts]] are [[Apocrine|apocrine glands]] that produce [[milk]] for the feeding of infant children; each breast has a [[nipple]] within an [[areola]] (nipple-areola complex, NAC), the skin color of which varies from pink to dark brown, and has [[sebaceous gland]]s. Within the [[mammary gland]], the [[lactiferous duct]]s produce [[Human breast milk|breast milk]], and are distributed throughout the breast, with two-thirds of the tissue within 30-mm of the base of the nipple. In each breast, 4–18 lactiferous ducts drain to the nipple; the glands-to-fat ratio is 2:1 in [[Lactation|lactating]] women, and to 1:1 in non-lactating women; besides milk glands, the breast is composed of [[connective tissue]] ([[collagen]], [[elastin]]), [[adipose tissue]] (white fat), and the suspensory [[Cooper's ligaments]]. The [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nervous system innervation]] of the breast is by the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth intercostal [[nerve]]s, while the [[Thoracic spinal nerve 4]] (T4) innervating the [[dermatomic area]] supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.<ref name="Tortora, Gerard J.">Tortora, Gerard J.

;The functional breast
Digestive contamination and systemic toxicity are the principal infant-health concerns; the leakage of breast implant filler to the breast milk, and if the filler is dangerous to the nursing infant. Breast implant device fillers are biologically inert&nbsp;— [[saline (medicine)|saline filler]] is salt water, and [[silicone]] filler is [[Digestion|indigestible]]&nbsp;— because each substance is chemically inert, and environmentally common. Moreover, proponent physicians have said there “should be no absolute contraindication to breast-feeding by women with silicone breast implants.”<ref>{{cite journal|author=Berlin, C. M. |title=Silicone Breast Implants and Breast-feeding|journal= Pediatrics |year=1994|volume= 94|pages=546–549|pmid=7936870|issue=4 Pt 1}}</ref> In the early 1990s, at the beginning of the silicone breast-implant sickness occurrences, small-scale, non-random studies (i.e. “patients came with complaints, which might have many sources”, not “doctors performed random tests”) indicated possible breast-feeding complications from silicone implants; yet no study reported device–disease causality.<ref name="berlin1996">Berlin, Cheston M., Jr. [http://www.llli.org/ba/Feb96.html Silicone Breast Implants and Breastfeeding],  Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania; from Breastfeeding Abstracts.

;The augmented breast
The woman with breast implants is able to breast-feed her infant; yet breast implant devices occasionally cause functional breast-feeding difficulties, especially the [[mammoplasty]] procedures that feature periareolar incisions and subglandular emplacement, which have greater incidences of breast-feeding difficulties. Therefore, to ensure her breast-feeding functionality post-surgery, the woman of child-bearing age seeking breast implants discusses with her [[Plastic surgery|plastic surgeon]] the implantation procedure that will least damage her [[lactiferous duct]]s and the nerves of the nipple-areola complex (NAC).<ref>[http://www.llli.org/NB/NBsurgery.html Breastfeeding after Breast Surgery], La Leche League (2009-09-05).</ref><ref>[http://www.llli.org/cbi/bibimplant.html Breastfeeding and Breast Implants], Selected Bibliography April 2003, LLLI Center for Breastfeeding Information.</ref><ref name="slate">Beam, Christopher (2009-12-11). [http://www.slate.com/id/2238096/ Inorganic Milk: Can Kendra Wilkinson breast-feed her baby even though she has implants?], [[Slate.com]].</ref> Before the augmenation mammoplasty, the woman consults with a lactation counsultant, to learn what post-operative [[lactation]] and breast-feeding conditions to expect; and consults with the plastic surgeon to jointly decide upon the implantation procedure and surgical techniques that will least damage the breast nerves, the milk ducts, the T4 [[dermatomic area]] and the [[lactiferous duct]]s, so that she might nurse her infant child.

Functional breast-feeding difficulies arise if the surgeon cut the [[lactiferous duct|milk ducts]] or the major nerves innervating the breast, or if the milk glands were otherwise damaged. Milk duct and nerve damage are more common to the periareolar incision implantation procedure, which cuts tissue near the nipple, whereas other implantation incision-plans&nbsp;— IMF (Inframammary Fold), TABA (Trans-Axillary Breast Augmentation), TUBA ([[Trans-umbilical breast augmentation|Trans-Umbilical Breast Augmentation]])&nbsp;— avoid the tissue of the nipple-areola complex; if the woman is concerned about possible breast-feeding difficulties, the periareolar incisions can be effected to reduce damage to the milk ducts and to the nerves of the NAC. The milk glands are affected most by subglandular implants (under the gland), and by large-sized breast implants, which pinch the lactiferous ducts and impede milk flow. Small-sized breast implants, and submuscular implantation, cause fewer breast-function problems; however, women have successfully breast-fed after undergoing periareolar incisions and subglandular emplacement.<ref name="slate"/>

===Psychology===
The usual breast augmentation patient is a young woman whose personality profile indicates psychological distress about her personal appearance and her body ([[self image]]), and a history of having endured criticism (teasing) about the aesthetics of her person.<ref name="Brinton2000">{{cite journal | author = Brinton L, Brown S, Colton T, Burich M, Lubin J|title = Characteristics of a Population of Women with Breast Implants Compared with Women Seeking other Types of Plastic Surgery|journal=Plastic Reconstructive Surgery|volume = 105|issue=3|pages=919–927|year=2000|pmid=10724251|doi=10.1097/00006534-200003000-00014}}</ref> The studies ''Body Image Concerns of Breast Augmentation Patients'' (2003) and ''Body Dysmorphic Disorder and Cosmetic Surgery'' (2006) reported that the woman who underwent breast augmentation surgery also had undergone [[psychotherapy]], suffered low [[self-esteem]], presented frequent occurrences of [[Depression (mood)|psychological depression]], had attempted [[suicide]], and suffered [[body dysmorphia]] — a type of mental illness wherein she perceives non-existent physical defects. Post-operative patient surveys about the mental health and the quality of life of the women, reported improved physical health, physical appearance, social life, self-confidence, self-esteem, and satisfactory [[sexual attraction|sexual functioning]]. Furthermore, most of the women reported long-term satisfaction with their breast implants; some despite having suffered medical complications that required surgical revision, either corrective or aesthetic.

The Cosmeticsurgery.com article ''They Need Bosoms, too — Women Weight Lifters'' (2013) reported that women weight-lifters have resorted to breast augmentation surgery to maintain a feminine physique, and so compensate for the loss of breast mass consequent to the increased lean-body mass and decreased body-fat consequent to [[Female bodybuilding|lifting weights]].<ref>[http://www.cosmeticsurgery.com/articles/archive/an~83/ They Need Bosoms, too - Women Weight Lifters], ''Cosmeticsurgery.com''</ref>

===Mental health===
The [[longitudinal study]] ''Excess Mortality from Suicide and other External Causes of Death Among Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants'' (2007), reported that women who sought breast implants are almost 3.0 times as likely to commit [[suicide]] as are women who have not sought breast implants. Compared to the standard suicide-rate for women of the general populace, the suicide-rate for women with augmented breasts remained alike until 10-years post-implantation, yet it increased to 4.5 times greater at the 11-year mark, and so remained until the 19-year mark, when it increased to 6.0 times greater at 20-years post-implantation. Moreover, additional to the suicide-risk, women with [[breast implant]]s also faced a trebled death risk from [[alcoholism]] and drugs abuse (prescription and recreational).<ref name="reuters.com">{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN0836919020070808?feedType=RSS&rpc=22&sp=true | work=Reuters | title=Breast Implants Linked with Suicide in Study | date=2007-08-08}}</ref><ref name="usatoday.com">{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-08-06-breast-implants_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Breast Implants Linked to Higher Suicide Rates | first=Anita | last=Manning | date=2007-08-06 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> Although seven studies have statistically connected a woman’s undergoing a breast augmentation procedure to a greater suicide-rate, the research indicates that augmenation surgery does not increase the suicide death-rate; and that, in the first instance, it is the [[psychopathology|psychopathologically]]-inclined woman who is likelier to undergo breast augmentation.<ref>{{cite pmid|11337605}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|12623911}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|14520056}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|16777929 }}</ref><ref name="pmid16477256">{{cite pmid|16477256}}</ref><ref>National Plastic Surgery Procedural Statistics, 2006.

Moreover, the study ''Effect of Breast Augmentation Mammoplasty on Self-Esteem and Sexuality: A Quantitative Analysis'' (2007), reported that the women attributed their improved self-esteem, self-image, and increased, satisfactory sexual functioning to having undergone breast augmentation; the cohort, aged 21–57 years, averaged post-operative self-esteem increases ranging from 20.7 to 24.9 points on the 30-point [[Rosenberg self-esteem scale]], which data supported the 78.6 per cent increase in the woman’s [[libido]], relative to her pre-operative level of libido. Therefore, before agreeing to any surgical procedure, the plastic surgeon evaluates and considers the woman’s [[mental health]] to determine if breast implants can positively affect her [[self-esteem]] and [[Sexual attraction|sexual functioning]].<ref>Nauert, Rick.

==Surgical procedures==

===Indications===
[[Image:Mastectomie 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Breast augmentation: The post-operative aspect of a right-breast cancer [[mastectomy]]; the woman is a candidate for a primary breast reconstruction with a breast implant.]]

An augmenation mammoplasty for emplacing [[breast implant]]s has three therapeutic purposes:

# '''primary reconstruction'''&nbsp;— to replace breast tissues damaged by [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] ([[blunt trauma|blunt]], [[penetrating trauma|penetrating]], [[blast injury|blast]]), disease ([[breast cancer]]), and failed anatomic development ([[tuberous breast|tuberous breast deformity]]).
# '''revision and reconstruction'''&nbsp;— to revise (correct) the outcome of a previous breast reconstruction surgery.
# '''primary augmentation'''&nbsp;— to aesthetically augment the size, form, and feel of the [[breast]]s.

The [[operating room]] time of post–[[mastectomy]] [[breast reconstruction]], and of breast augmentation surgery is determined by the emplacement procedure employed, the type of incisional technique, the breast implant (type and materials), and the pectoral locale of the implant pocket.

===Incision types===
The emplacement of a breast implant device is performed with five types of [[surgery|surgical]] incisions:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kearneymd.com/procedures/breast-enhancement/breast-augmentation/|title=Breast Augmentation|last=Kearney|first=Robert|publisher=Robert Kearney MD FACS|accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref>

# '''Inframammary'''&nbsp;— an incision made below the breast, in the [[infra-mammary fold]] (IMF), which affords maximal access for precise dissection and emplacement of the breast implant devices. It is the preferred surgical technique for emplacing silicone-gel implants, because of the longer incisions required; yet, IMF implantation can produce thicker, slightly more visible surgical scars.
# '''Periareolar'''&nbsp;— an incision made along the [[areola]]r periphery (border), which provides an optimal approach when adjustments to the IMF position are required, or when a [[mastopexy]] (breast lift) is included to the primary mammoplasty procedure. In the periareolar emplacement method, the incision is around the medial-half (inferior half) of the areola’s circumference. Silicone-gel implants can be difficult to emplace with this incision, because of the short, five-centimetre length (~ 5.0&nbsp;cm.) of the required access-incision. Aesthetically, because the scars are at the areola’s border, they usually are less visible than the IMF-incision scars of women with light-pigment areolae. Furthermore, periareolar implantation produces a greater incidence of [[capsular contracture]], severs the [[milk duct]]s and the [[nerve]]s to the nipple, thus causes the most post-operative functional problems, e.g. impeded [[breast feeding]].
# '''Transaxillary'''&nbsp;— an incision made to the axilla (armpit), from which the dissection tunnels medially, thus allows emplacing the implants without producing visible scars upon the breast proper; yet is likelier to produce inferior asymmetry of the implant-device position. Therefore, surgical revision of transaxillary emplaced breast implants usually requires either an IMF incision or a periareolar incision. Transaxillary emplacement can be performed bluntly or with an [[endoscope]] (illuminated video microcamera).
# '''Transumbilical'''&nbsp;— a [[trans-umbilical breast augmentation]] (TUBA) is a less common implant-device insertion technique wherein the incision is at the [[navel]], and the dissection tunnels superiorly. This surgical approach enables emplacing the breast implants without producing visible scars upon the breast; but it makes appropriate dissection and device-emplacement more technically difficult. A TUBA procedure is performed bluntly&nbsp;— without the endoscope’s visual assistance&nbsp;— and is not appropriate for emplacing (pre-filled) silicone-gel implants, because of the great potential for damaging the elastomer silicone shell of the breast-implant device during its manual insertion through the short&nbsp;— two-centimetre (~2.0&nbsp;cm.)&nbsp;— incision at the navel, and because pre-filled silicone-gel implants are incompressible, and cannot be inserted through so small an incision.<ref name="johnson">{{cite pmid|8415961}}</ref>
# '''Transabdominal'''&nbsp;— as in the TUBA procedure, in the transabdominoplasty breast augmentation (TABA), the breast implants are tunneled superiorly from the abdominal incision into bluntly dissected implant pockets, whilst the patient simultaneously undergoes an [[abdominoplasty]].<ref name="TABA">{{cite pmid|14707667}}</ref>

===Implant pocket placement===
[[Image:Breast implants.png|thumb|right|200px|Breast augmentation: (1) cross-sectional schemes of a subglandular breast prosthesis implantation; and (2) of a submuscular breast prosthesis implantation.]]

The four [[Plastic surgery|surgical]] approaches to emplacing breast implants to the implant pocket are described in [[Human anatomy|anatomic]] relation to the [[pectoralis major muscle]].

# '''Subglandular'''&nbsp;— the breast implant is emplaced to the [[retromammary space]], between the breast tissue and the [[pectoralis major muscle]]. This position closely approximates the plane of normal breast tissue, and affords the most aesthetic results; but, in patients with thin pectoral soft-tissue, the subglandular position is likelier to show the ripples and wrinkles of the underlying implant. Moreover, the capsular-contracture rate is slightly greater with the subglandular implantation approach.
# '''Subfascial'''&nbsp;— the breast implant is emplaced beneath the [[fascia]] of the [[pectoralis major muscle]]; this is a variant of the subglandular position.<ref name="Graf">{{cite pmid|12560720}}</ref> The technical benefits of the subfascial breast-implant pocket technique are debated; proponent surgeons report that the layer of [[Fascia|fascial tissue]] provides greater implant coverage and better sustains its position.<ref name="subfascial">{{cite pmid|14758271}}</ref>
# '''Subpectoral''' (dual plane)&nbsp;— the breast implant is emplaced beneath the [[pectoralis major muscle]], after releasing the inferior muscular attachments, with or without partial dissection of the subglandular plane. Resultantly, the implant is partially beneath the pectoralis major muscle in the upper pole, while the implant’s lower pole is in the subglandular plane. This implantation technique achieves maximal coverage of the upper pole of the implant, whilst allowing the expansion of the implant’s lower pole; however, animation (movement) of the breast implants in the subpectoral plane can be excessive for some patients, a condition known as “animation deformity”.<ref name="Tebbettsdual">{{cite pmid|11964998}}</ref>
# '''Submuscular'''&nbsp;— the breast implant is emplaced beneath the [[pectoralis major muscle]], without releasing the inferior origin of the muscle proper. Total muscular coverage of the implant can be achieved by releasing the lateral muscles of the chest wall&nbsp;— either the [[serratus muscle]] or the [[pectoralis minor muscle]], or both&nbsp;— and [[Surgical suture|suturing]] it, or them, to the pectoralis major muscle. In [[breast reconstruction]] surgery, the submuscular implantation approach effects maximal coverage of the breast implants.

===Post-surgical recovery===
The [[surgery|surgical]] [[scar]]s of a breast augmentation [[mammoplasty]] heal at 6-weeks post-operative, and fade within several months, according to the skin type of the woman. Depending upon the daily physical activity the woman might require, the augmentation mammoplasty patient usually resumes her normal life activities at about 1-week post-operative. The woman who underwent submuscular implantation (beneath the [[pectoralis major]] muscles) usually has a longer post–operative convalescence, and experiences more pain, because of the healing of the deep-tissue cuts into the chest muscles for the breast augmenation. The patient usually does not exercise or engage in strenuous physical activities for about 6 weeks. Moreover, during the initial convalescence, the patient is encouraged to regularly exercise (flex and move) her arms to alleviate pain and discomfort; and, as required, [[analgesic]] medication catheters for alleviating pain.<ref>{{cite pmid|19083538}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|19083591}}</ref>

The plastic surgical emplacement of breast-implant devices, either for [[breast reconstruction]] or for [[Plastic surgery|aesthetic purpose]], presents the same health risks common to [[surgery]], such as adverse reaction to [[anesthesia]], [[hematoma]] (post-operative bleeding), [[seroma]] (fluid accumulation), incision-site breakdown (wound infection). Complications specific to breast augmentation include breast pain, altered sensation, impeded breast-feeding function, visible wrinkling, asymmetry, thinning of the breast tissue, and [[symmastia]], the “bread loafing” of the bust that interrupts the natural plane between the breasts. Specific treatments for the complications of indwelling breast implants&nbsp;— [[capsular contracture]] and capsular rupture&nbsp;— are periodic [[MRI]] monitoring and physical examinations. Furthermore, [[Complications (medical)|complications]] and re-operations related to the implantation surgery, and to [[Tissue expansion|tissue expanders]] (implant place-holders during surgery) can cause unfavorable [[scar]]ring in approximately 6–7% of the patients.

====Implant rupture====
Because a breast implant is a '''[[Medical device|Class III medical device]]''' of limited product-life, the principal rupture-rate factors are its age and design; nonetheless, a breast implant device can retain its mechanical integrity for decades in a woman’s body.<ref name="Brown2000">{{cite pmid|11000165}}</ref> When a saline breast implant ruptures, leaks, and empties, it quickly deflates, and thus can be readily explanted (surgically removed). The follow-up report, ''Natrelle Saline-filled Breast Implants: a Prospective 10-year Study'' (2009) indicated rupture-deflation rates of 3–5% at 3-years post-implantation, and 7–10% rupture-deflation rates at 10-years post-implantation.<ref name="Walker2009">{{cite pmid|19233001}}</ref> When a silicone breast implant ruptures it usually does not deflate, yet the filler gel does leak from it, which can migrate to the implant pocket; therefore, an '''intracapsular rupture''' (in-capsule leak) can become an '''extracapsular rupture''' (out-of-capsule leak), and each occurrence is resolved by explantation. Although the leaked silicone filler-gel can migrate from the chest tissues to elsewhere in the woman’s body, most clinical [[Complications (medical)|complications]] are limited to the [[breast]] and [[axilla|armpit]] areas, usually manifested as [[granulomas]] (inflammatory nodules) and axillary [[lymphadenopathy]] (enlarged lymph glands in the armpit area).<ref name="Holmich2004">{{cite journal| pmid= 15220594 |doi= 10.1097/01.PRS.0000128821.87939.B5| title= Untreated Silicone Breast Implant Rupture| year= 2004| author=Hölmich LR, Vejborg IM, Conrad C, Sletting S, Høier-Madsen M, Fryzek JP, McLaughlin JK, Kjøller K, Wiik A, Friis S.| journal= Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery| volume= 114| pages= 204–14; discussion 215–6| issue= 1}}</ref><ref name="Katzin 2005">{{cite pmid|15767806}}</ref><ref name = FDA_2004c>{{cite web | title = Study of Rupture of Silicone Gel-filled Breast Implants (MRI Component) | work = FDA Breast Implant Consumer Handbook&nbsp;– 2004 | url = http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/breastimplants/handbook2004/diseases.html | date = 2000-05-22 | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>

From the long-term [[MRI]] data for single-lumen breast implants, the European literature about '''Second generation''' silicone-gel breast implants (1970s design), reported silent device-rupture rates of 8–15% at 10-years post-implantation (15–30% of the patients).<ref name="Holmich2003">{{cite journal | author=Hölmich LR, Friis S, Fryzek JP, Vejborg IM, Conrad C, Sletting S, Kjøller K, McLaughlin JK, Olsen JH|title=Incidence of Silicone Breast Implant Rupture| journal=Arch Surg. | year=2003|pages=801–806| volume=138 | issue=7 | pmid=12860765|doi=10.1001/archsurg.138.7.801 }}</ref><ref name="Heden2006">{{cite pmid|16874191}}</ref><ref name="Collis2005">{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/05/briefing/2005-4101b1_Mentor-Briefing%20doc-supplement.DOC | title=FDA summary of clinical issues (MS Word document)}}</ref> In 2009, a branch study of the U.S. FDA’s core [[clinical trial]]s for primary breast augmentation surgery patients, reported low device-rupture rates of 1.1% at 6-years post-implantation.<ref name="cunningham2009">{{cite pmid|19437068}}</ref> The first series of [[MRI]] evaluations of the silicone breast implants with thick filler-gel reported a device-rupture rate of 1.0%, or less, at the median 6-year device-age.<ref name="Heden">{{cite journal | author=Hedén P, Boné B, Murphy DK, Slicton A, Walker PS| title=Style 410 Cohesive Silicone Breast Implants: Safety and Effectiveness at 5 to 9 years after Implantation| journal=Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | year=2006 | pages=1281–1287| volume=118 | issue=6 | pmid=17051096 | doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000239457.17721.5d }}</ref> Statistically, the manual examination (palpation) of the woman is inadequate for accurately evaluating if a breast implant has ruptured.

====Capsular contracture====
{{main|Capsular contracture}}
The human body’s [[immune response]] to a surgically installed foreign object&nbsp;— breast implant, cardiac [[pacemaker]], [[orthopedic]] [[prosthesis]]&nbsp;— is to cover (encapsulate) it with [[Scar|scar tissue]] capsules of tightly woven [[collagen]] fibers, to maintain bodily integrity by isolating the foreign object, and so tolerate its presence. [[Capsular contracture]]&nbsp;— which should be distinguished from normal capsular tissue&nbsp;— occurs when the collagen-fiber capsule thickens and compresses the breast implant; it is a painful [[Complication (medical)|complication]] that might distort either the breast implant, or the breast, or both. The cause of capsular contracture is unknown, but the common incidence factors include bacterial contamination, device-shell rupture, filler leakage, and [[hematoma]].

[[Image:Capsular fibrosis.jpg|thumb|Revision mammoplasty: Breast implant complication, the Baker scale Grade IV capsular contracture of a subglandular silicone implant in the right breast.]]

The device implantation surgical procedures that have reduced the incidence of capsular contracture include submuscular implant placement, using textured-surface implant devices (polyurethane-coated);<ref name="Barnsley2006">{{cite pmid|16772915}}</ref><ref name="Wong2006">{{cite pmid|17016195}}</ref><ref name="Handel2006">{{cite pmid|19338905}}</ref> limited handling of the implants, limited contact with the recipient-site skin before emplacement, and irrigation with triple-antibiotic solutions.<ref name="Mladick1993">{{cite pmid| 8213311}}</ref><ref name="Adams2006">{{cite pmid|16404244}}</ref>

The correction of capsular contracture might require an open capsulotomy (surgical release) of the collagen-fiber capsule, or the removal, and possible replacement, of the breast implant. Furthermore, in treating capsular contracture, the closed capsulotomy (disruption via external manipulation) once was a common maneuver for treating hard capsules, but now is a discouraged technique, because it can rupture the breast implant. Non-surgical treatments for collagen-fiber capsules include massage, external [[medical ultrasound|ultrasonic]] therapy, [[leukotriene antagonist|leukotriene pathway inhibitors]] such as [[zafirlukast]] (Accolate) or [[montelukast]] (Singulair), and [[Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy|pulsed electromagnetic field therapy]] (PEMFT).<ref name="Planas2001">{{cite pmid|11349308}}</ref><ref name="Schlesinger2002">{{cite pmid|19331987}}</ref><ref name="Scuderi">{{cite pmid|16977359}}</ref><ref name="Silver1982">{{cite pmid|7071225}}</ref>

====Repair and revision surgeries====
When the woman is unsatisfied with the outcome of the augmentation mammoplasty; or when technical or medical complications occur; or because of the breast implants’ limited product life ([[Medical device|Class III medical device]], in the U.S.), it is likely she might require replacing the breast implants. The common revision surgery indications include major and minor medical complications, [[capsular contracture]], shell rupture, and device deflation.<ref name = FDA_2004b /> Revision incidence rates were greater for breast reconstruction patients, because of the post-mastectomy changes to the soft-tissues and to the skin envelope of the breast, and to the [[human anatomy|anatomical]] borders of the breast, especially in women who received adjuvant external [[radiation therapy]].<ref name = FDA_2004b /> Moreover, besides breast reconstruction, [[breast cancer]] patients usually undergo revision surgery of the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and symmetry procedures upon the opposite breast, to create a bust of natural appearance, size, form, and feel. Carefully matching the type and size of the breast implants to the patient’s pectoral soft-tissue characteristics reduces the incidence of revision surgery. Appropriate tissue matching, implant selection, and proper implantation technique, the re-operation rate was 3.0% at the 7-year-mark, compared with the re-operation rate of 20% at the 3-year-mark, as reported by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.<ref name="Tebbets2006">{{cite pmid| 15457046}}</ref><ref name="Tebbets2">{{cite pmid| 17051118}}</ref>

====Systemic disease and sickness====
[[Image:BreastImplant09.JPG|thumb|Breast implant: Chest X-ray of a woman with bilaterally emplaced implants.]]

Since the 1990s, independent, comprehensive reviews of the studies seeking causal links between silicone-gel breast implants and [[systemic disease]] reported no causal link between the implants and subsequent systemic and autoimmune diseases.<ref name=Canada_2005>{{cite web|title=Expert Advisory Panel on Breast Implants: Record of Proceedings|publisher=HealthCanada|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/md-im/activit/sci-consult/implant-breast-mammaire/eapbi_rop_gceim_crd_2005-09-29_e.html|date=2005-09-29|accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref><ref name=BIIB_2001>{{cite book|author=Therapeutic Goods Administration|title=Breast Implant Information Booklet|edition=4th|publisher=Australian Government|year=2001|url=http://www.tga.gov.au/docs/pdf/breasti4.pdf|format=PDF|isbn=0-642-73579-4 }}</ref><ref name=EQUAM_2000>{{cite web|author=European Committee on Quality Assurance and Medical Devices in Plastic Surgery | title=Consensus Declaration on Breast Implants|url=http://www.secpre.org/pdf/equam.pdf|format=PDF|date=2000-06-23|accessdate=2007-05-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061230061944/http://www.secpre.org/pdf/equam.pdf |archivedate = December 30, 2006}}</ref><ref name=UK_1998>{{cite web|title=Silicone Gel Breast Implant Report Launched&nbsp;– No Epidemiological Evidence For Link With Connective Tissue Disease&nbsp;– Independent Review Group|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Pressreleases/DH_4024791|date=1998-07-13|accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref> Nonetheless, during the 1990s, thousands of women claimed sickness caused by their breast implants; the medical complaints included [[neurology|neurological]] and [[rheumatology|rheumatological]] health problems. In the [[Journal of Rheumatology]], the article ''Where There’s Smoke There’s Fire: the Silicone Breast Implant Controversy Continues to Flicker: a New Disease that needs to be Defined'' (2003), reported that some of the studies indicated that the psychosomatic (subjective) symptoms and the clinical (objective) symptoms reported by the women might improve after explantation of the breast implants.<ref name=Vasey_2003>{{cite pmid|14528500}}</ref>

Longer post-operative tracking of breast augmentation patients yielded much information about the symptomatic incidence of systemic diseases and autoimmune diseases. In the study ''Long-term Health Status of Danish Women with Silicone Breast Implants'' (2004), the national healthcare system of Denmark reported that women with implants did not risk a greater incidence and diagnosis of [[autoimmune disease]], when compared to same-age women in the general population; that the incidence of musculoskeletal disease was lower among women with breast implants than among women who had undergone other cosmetic surgery; and that they had a lower incidence rate than like women in the general population.<ref name="Breiting2004">{{cite pmid|15220596}}</ref><ref name="Kjoller2004">{{cite pmid| 14676691}}</ref> Follow-up [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] of these breast implant patients confirmed the previous findings on the matter.<ref name="Fryzek2007">{{cite pmid|17321754}}</ref>

European and North American studies reported that women who underwent augmentation mammoplasty, and any plastic surgery procedure, tended to be healthier and wealthier than the general population, before and after surgery; that plastic surgery patients had a lower [[standardized mortality ratio]] than did patients for other surgeries; yet faced an increased risk of death by [[lung cancer]] than other plastic surgery patients. Moreover, because only one study, the Swedish ''Long-term Cancer Risk Among Swedish Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants: an Update of a Nationwide Study'' (2006), controlled for [[tobacco smoking]], the data were insufficient to establish verifiable statistical differences between smokers and non-smokers that might contribute to the higher [[lung cancer]] mortality rate of women with breast implants.<ref name="pmid16477256"/><ref>{{cite pmid|16622125}}</ref> The long-term study of 25,000 women, ''Mortality among Canadian Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants'' (2006), reported that the “findings suggest that breast implants do not directly increase mortality in women.”<ref name="Villenueve2006">{{cite pmid|16777929}}</ref>

Furthermore, the study, ''Silicone gel Breast Implant Rupture, Extracapsular Silicone, and Health Status in a Population of Women'' (2001), reported an increased incidence of [[fibromyalgia]] among women who suffered [[Capsular contracture|extracapsular silicone-gel leakage]] than among women whose breast implant devices neither ruptured nor leaked.<ref name="Brown2001">{{cite journal|author=Brown SL, Pennello G, Berg WA, Soo MS, Middleton MS|title=Silicone gel Breast Implant Rupture, Extracapsular Silicone, and Health Status in a Population of Women|journal=Journal of Rheumatology|year=2001|pages=996–1003|volume=28|issue=5|pmid=11361228 |url=http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/breastimplants/extracapstudy.html }}</ref> The study later was criticized as methodologically flawed, and later studies failed to establish such a causal device–disease association. After investigating, the U.S. FDA reported that “the weight of the [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] evidence published in the literature does not support an association between fibromyalgia and breast implants.”<ref>{{cite pmid|15156983}}</ref><ref name=FDA_2004>{{cite web|title=Diseases|work=FDA Breast Implant Consumer Handbook&nbsp;– 2004|url=http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/breastimplants/handbook2004/diseases.html|date=2004-06-08|accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref> Nonetheless, excluding the possibility that a small group of breast implant patients might sicken through (as yet) unknown disease mechanisms, the international medical consensus is that silicone-gel breast implant devices neither cause nor aggravate systemic and [[auto-immune disease]]s.<ref name=FDA_2004 />

====Platinum toxicity====
In the manufacture of silicone breast implants, the [[Metal|metallic element]] [[platinum]] is a [[catalyst]] (a chemical that accelerates a reaction between two other chemicals, without becoming part of the new compound chemical) used to transform [[silicone oil]] into silicone gel for the [[elastomer]] silicone shells, and other medical-silicone devices.<ref name="RinzlerCarol">Rinzler, Carol Ann (2009) [http://books.google.com/books?id=N5nWmFCbYqcC&printsec=frontcover ''The encyclopedia of Cosmetic and Plastic Surgery''], New York: Facts on File, ISBN 1438127022 p.23.</ref> The literature indicates that trace quantities of platinum leak from such types of silicone breast implant; therefore, platinum is present in the surrounding pectoral tissue(s). The rare pathogenic consequence is an accumulation of platinum in the [[bone marrow]], from where blood cells might deliver it to [[nerve|nerve endings]], thus causing [[nervous system]] disorders such as blindness, deafness, and [[tic|nervous tics]] (involuntary muscle contractions).<ref name="RinzlerCarol" /> In 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reviewed the pertinent studies on the human biological effects of breast-implant platinum, and reported little causal evidence of platinum toxicity to the women with breast implants.<ref name="arepelli2003">{{cite pmid|12627791}}</ref>

In the scientific journal [[Analytical Chemistry]], the study ''Total Platinum Concentration and Platinum Oxidation States in Body Fluids, Tissue, and Explants from Women Exposed to Silicone and Saline Breast Implants by IC-ICPMS'' (2006), proved controversial for claiming to have identified previously undocumented toxic platinum oxidative states ''in vivo''.<ref name="AnalChem2006-Lykissa">{{cite pmid|16642977}}</ref> Later, in a letter to the readers, the editors of Analytical Chemistry published their concerns about the faulty [[Experiment|experimental design]] of the study, and warned readers to “use caution in evaluating the conclusions drawn in the paper.”<ref>{{cite journal|author=Jacoby, Mitch | url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/84/i31/8431notw5.html |title=Dubious Breast Implant Study: Doubts now surround study claiming to have found high levels of platinum in women with silicone breast|date=2006-06-31|journal=Chemical & Engineering News|volume=84|issue=31|page=13}}</ref> Furthermore, after reviewing the research data of the study, and other pertinent literature, the U.S. FDA reported that the data do not support the findings presented; that the platinum used, in new-model breast-implant devices, likely is not [[Ionization|ionized]], and therefore is not a significant risk to the health of the women.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/breastimplants/platinum.html| title=FDA Backgrounder on Platinum in Silicone Breast Implants| publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]}}</ref>

==Non-implant breast augmentation==

===Technical background===
;Liposuction
The technique of [[liposuction]] (lipoplasty) was conceived by the Italian plastic surgeons Arpat Fischer and Giorgio Fischer in 1974, and was put into medical practice in 1975.<ref>Fischer G. Surgical Treatment of Cellulitis (presentation) Third Congress of the International Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, Rome, 31 May 1975</ref> Autologous adipocyte fat was harvested by means of 5-mm incisions, and an electrically and pneumatically powered instrument that rotated and alternated in its aspiration of the fat through a [[cannula]]. Meanwhile, through a separate incision to the fat-tissue harvest site, [[saline solution]] was injected to dilute the fat and facilitate its aspiration.<ref>Fischer G. [http://www.ijcs.org/8/26/253/index.php?pageFrom=2&pageTo=2 First Surgical Treatment for Modelling the Body’s Cellulite with Three 5-mm incisions]. Bulletin of the International Academy of Cosmetic Surgery 1976; 2:35–37</ref>

In 1977, Fisher and Fischer reviewed 245 cases with the “planotome” instrument for treating cellulite in the lateral [[Human trochanter|trochanter]]ic (hip-thigh) areas. There was a 4.9% incidence of [[seroma]]s, despite incision-wound suction [[catheter]]s and compression dressings; 2.0% of the cases presented pseudo-cyst formation that required removal of the capsule ([[cyst]]) through a wider incision (+ 5&nbsp;mm) and the use of the panotome.<ref>Fischer A., Fischer G. Revised Technique for Cellulite fat reduction in Riding Breeches deformity. Bulletin of the International Academy of Cosmetic Surgery 1977; 2(4):40–43</ref><ref>Schiffman, p. 3.</ref>

The advent of liposuction technology facilitated medical applications of the liposuction-harvested fat tissue as autologous filler for injection to correct bodily defects, and for breast augmentation. Dr. Melvin Bircoll introduced the practice of contouring the breast and for correcting bodily defects with autologous fat grafts harvested by liposuction; and he presented the fat-injection method used for emplacing the fat grafts.<ref>Bircoll M. Autologous Fat Transplantation (presentation) The Asian Congress of Plastic Surgery, February 1982</ref><ref>Bircoll MJ. New Frontiers in Suction Lipectomy (presentation) Second Asian Congress of Plastic Surgery, Pattiya, Thailand, February 1984</ref> The surgeon E. Krulig emplaced fat grafts with a syringe and needle (lipo-injection), and later used a disposable fat trap to facilitate the collection and to ensure the sterility of the harvested adipocyte tissue.<ref>Krulig E. Lipo-injection. American Journal of Cosmetic Surgery 1987; 4(2): 123–129</ref><ref>Schiffman, p. 4.</ref>

;Lipo-injector gun
To emplace the autologous fat tissue grafts, Drs. J. Newman and J. Levin designed a lipo-injector gun with a gear-driven plunger that allowed the even injection of autologous fat tissue to the desired recipient sites. The control afforded by the injector gun assisted the plastic surgeon in controlling excessive pressure to the fat in the barrel of the syringe, thus avoiding over-filling the recipient site.<ref>Newman J, Levin J. Facial Lipo-transplant Surgery. American Journal of Cosmetic Surgery 1987; 4(2):131–140</ref> The later-design lipo-injector gun featured a ratchet-gear operation that that afforded the surgeon great control in accurately emplacing autologous fat to the recipient site; a trigger action injected 0.1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> of filler.<ref>Agris J. Autologous Fat Transplantation: A Three-year Study. American Journal of Cosmetic Surgery 1987; 4(2): 95–102</ref> Since 1989, most non-surgical, fat-graft augmentation of the breast features the emplacement of adipocyte fat outside the breast [[parenchyma]]&nbsp;— up to 300 ml of fat, in three equal measures (aliquots), is emplaced to the subpectoral space and to the intrapectoral muscle space of the pectoralis major muscle, and the submammary space, to achieve a breast outcome of natural appearance and contour.<ref>Schiffman, p. 226.</ref>

===Autologous fat grafting===
[[File:Dr. Placik Chicago Breast Fat Grafting 19097.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Non-implant breast augmenation: the pre-procedural aspects (left) and the post-procedural aspects (right) of breasts enlarged and contoured with autologous fat grafts.]]
Autologous fat grafting to the [[breast]] is applied to the correction of breast asymmetry, the correction of breast deformities, [[breast reconstruction]] (as adjunct and primary technique), for the improvement of soft-tissue coverage of breast implants, and for the aesthetic enhancement of the bust. The careful harvesting and [[centrifuge|centrifugal]] refinement of the mature adipocyte tissue&nbsp;— to be injected in small aliquots&nbsp;— allows the transplanted fat tissue to remain viable in the breast and provide it the structure and contour that cannot be achieved solely with breast implants or with corrective surgery. As in all breast procedures, the grafted fat [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] can suffer [[necrosis]], and concomitant [[Metastatic calcification|calcification]]s and cysts, and palpable lumps; the cause of calcification is unknown, but the post-procedure tissue changes resemble those resulting from other breast procedures such as [[Breast reduction plasty|breast reduction]]. The research indicates the efficacy of fat grafting for breast reconstruction the treatment of radiation damage to the chest, the incidental reduction of [[capsular contracture]], and the improved soft-tissue coverage of breast implants.<ref>Pierrefeu-Lagrange, A.

In ''Fat Grafting to the Breast Revisited: Safety and Efficacy'' (2007), Sydney Coleman and Alessia Saboeiro reported successful transferences of fat to the [[breast]], and proposed fat grafting as a non-implant alternative to the usual surgical procedures for breast augmentation, breast defect correction, and breast reconstruction. Moreover, although liposuction is currently used to harvest fat for grafting to the breast, in 1895, in the nineteenth century, Dr. Vincent Czerny effected the earliest breast enlargement with fat when he used the patient’s autologous adipose tissue, harvested from a benign lumbar [[lipoma]], to repair the asymmetry of the breast from which he had removed a tumor.<ref>Czerny V.

In a 17-patient cohort, 2 patients had [[breast cancer]], diagnosed by [[Mammography|mammogram]], one at 12-months post-procedure, and the other at 92-months, after the fat transfer to the breast. In contemporary praxis, beyond the breast proper, fat grafts are injected to the pectoralis major muscle, and to the postpectoral space and to the prepectoral space, before and behind the muscle. In post-mastectomy breast reconstruction, the grafted fat is used to create a breast mound, by augmenting the extant breast tissues. Structural fat grafting was performed to either one or both breasts of the 17 women; the age range of the women was 25–55 years, the mean age was 38.2 years. The indications included [[micromastia]] (10 patients); explantation deformity (one patient); post-augmentation deformity with breast implants (two patients); [[tuberous breast deformity]] (one patient); [[Poland syndrome|Poland’s syndrome]] (one patient); and post-mastectomy [[breast reconstruction|reconstruction]] deformity (two patients). The pre-procedure mammograms were negative for [[Breast diseases|malignant neoplasms]]. The types of [[anaesthesia]] applied were general (two patients) and [[epidural|epidural analgesia]] plus sedation, with local infiltration and intercostal nerve blocks (15 patients). The autologous adipocyte tissue was grafted in one-to-three stages; the average tissue graft volume was 278.6&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> of fat per operation per breast. Post-procedure, the patient was instructed to regard any [[breast disease|lump]] in the breasts as unrelated to the fat grafts, until after a complete medical workup of the breast lump had been performed.<ref name=Coleman>{{cite pmid|17312477}}</ref>

A 2007 study of 40 women showed that adding additional adipose [[stem cells]] to the aspirated fat from liposuction improved the success rate of the process.  <ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2175019/pdf/266_2007_Article_9019.pdf</ref>

===Fat grafting techniques===
;Fat harvesting and contouring
The centrifugal refinement of the liposuction-harvested adipocyte tissues removes blood products and free [[lipids]] to produce autologous breast filler. The injectable filler-fat is obtained by centrifuging (spinning) the fat-filled syringes for sufficient time to allow the serum, blood, and oil (liquid fat) components to collect, by density, apart from the refined, injection-quality fat.<ref>Asken, S. ''Autologous Fat Transplantation: Micro and Macro Techniques''. American Journal of Cosmetic Surgery 1987; 4(2):111–121</ref> To refine the fat for facial injection quality, the fat-filled syringes are centrifuged for 1.0 minute at 2,000 RPM, which separates the unnecessary solution, leaving refined filler-fat.<ref>{{cite pmid|1950806}}</ref> Moreover, centrifugation at 10,000 RPM for 10 minutes produces a “collagen graft”; the [[Histology|histologic]] composition of which is [[Cell (biology)|cell]] residues, [[collagen]] fibres, and 5.0 per cent intact fat cells. Furthermore, because the patient’s body naturally absorbs some of the fat grafts, the breasts maintain their contours and volumes for 18–24 months.<ref>Uebel, C.O. ''Facial Sculpture with Centrifuged fat Collagen'', Hinder, V.T. (Ed.) Plastic Surgery Vol. II. Amsterdam Excerpta Medica 1992 pp. 749–752</ref><ref>Schiffman, p. 5.</ref>
[[File:20845 Dr. Placik Chicago Arlington Heights Illinois Fat Grafting Breasts.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Fat-graft breast augmentation: the pre-operative aspects (left) and the post-operative aspects (right) of a large-volume non-surgical augmentation.]]

In the Coleman–Saboeiro study, the autologous fat was harvested by liposuction, using a 10-ml syringe attached to a two-hole Coleman harvesting [[cannula]]; after centrifugation, the refined breast-filler fat was transferred to 3-ml syringes. Blunt infiltration cannulas were used to emplace the fat through 2-mm incisions; the blunt cannula injection method allowed greater dispersion of small aliquots (equal measures) of fat, and reduced the possibility of intravascular fat injection; no sharp needles are used for fat-graft injection to the breasts. The 2-mm incisions were positioned to allow the infiltration (emplacement) of fat grafts from at least two directions; a 0.2 ml fat volume was emplaced with each withdrawal of the cannula.<ref>{{cite pmid|19332014}}</ref>

The breasts were contoured by layering the fat grafts into different levels within the breast, until achieving the desired breast form. The fat-graft injection technique allows the plastic surgeon precise control in accurately contouring the breast&nbsp;— from the chest wall to the breast-skin envelope&nbsp;— with subcutaneous fat grafts to the superficial planes of the breast. This greater degree of breast sculpting is unlike the global augmentation realised with a breast implant emplaced below the breast or below the pectoralis major muscle, respectively expanding the [[retromammary space]] and the retropectoral space. The greatest proportion of the grafted fat usually is infiltrated to the pectoralis major muscle, then to the retropectoral space, and to the prepectoral space, (before and behind the pectoralis major muscle). Moreover, although fat grafting to the breast [[parenchyma]] usually is minimal, it is performed to increase the degree of projection of the [[Cleavage (breasts)|bust]].<ref name=Coleman/>

;Fat-graft injection
The biologic survival of autologous fat [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] depends upon the correct handling of the fat graft, of its careful washing (refinement) to remove extraneous blood cells, and of the controlled, blunt-cannula injection (emplacement) of the refined fat-tissue grafts to an adequately [[Circulatory system|vascularized]] recipient site. Because the body resorbs some of the injected fat grafts (volume loss), compensative over-filling aids in obtaining a satisfactory breast outcome for the patient; thus the transplantation of large-volume fat grafts greater than required, because only 25–50 per cent of the fat graft survives at 1-year post-transplantation.<ref>Guerney, C.E. ''Experimental Study of the Behavior of Free fat Transplants''. Surgery 1938, 3:679–692</ref> Correct technique maximizes fat graft survival by minimizing [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] trauma during the liposuction harvesting and the centrifugal refinement, and by injecting the fat in small aliquots (equal measures), not clumps (too-large measures). Injecting minimal-volume aliquots with each pass of the [[cannula]] maximizes the surface area contact, between the grafted fat-tissue and the recipient breast-tissue, because proximity to a vascular system ([[Circulatory system|blood supply]]) encourages [[Histology|histologic]] survival and minimizes the potential for fat necrosis.<ref name=Coleman/> Transplanted autologous fat tissue undergoes histologic changes like those undergone by a bone transplant; if the body accepts the fat-tissue graft, it is replaced with new fat tissue, if the fat-graft dies it is replaced by [[Fibrous connective tissue|fibrous tissue]]. New fat tissue is generated by the activity of a large, wandering [[Histiocyte|histocyte]]-type [[Cell (biology)|cell]], which ingests fat and then becomes a fat cell.<ref>Neuhof H. (1923) ''The Transplantation of Tissues'' New York:D. Appleton p. 74</ref> When the breast-filler fat is injected to the breasts in clumps (too-large measures), fat cells emplaced too distant from blood vessels might die, which can lead to fat tissue necrosis, causing lumps, calcifications, and the eventual formation of liponecrotic cysts.

The operating room (OR) time required to harvest, refine, and emplace fat to the breasts is greater than the usual 2-hour OR time; the usual infiltration time was approximately 2-hours for the first 100cm<sup>3</sup> volume, and approximately 45 minutes for injecting each additional 100cm<sup>3</sup> volume of breast-filler fat. The technique for injecting fat grafts for breast augmentation allows the plastic surgeon great control in sculpting the breasts to the required contour, especially in the correction of [[tuberous breast deformity]]. In which case, no fat-graft is emplaced beneath the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and the skin envelope of the breast is selectively expanded (contoured) with subcutaneously emplaced body-fat, immediately beneath the skin. Such controlled contouring selectively increased the proportional volume of the breast in relation to the size of the nipple-areola complex, and thus created a breast of natural form and appearance; greater verisimilitude than is achieved solely with breast implants. The fat-corrected, breast-implant deformities, were inadequate soft-tissue coverage of the implant(s) and [[capsular contracture]], achieved with subcutaneous fat-grafts that hid the implant-device edges and wrinkles, and decreased the palpability of the underlying breast implant. Furthermore, grafting autologous fat around the breast implant can result in softening the breast capsule.<ref name=rigotti/>

;External tissue expansion
The successful outcome of fat-graft breast augmentation is enhanced by achieving a pre-expanded recipient site to create the breast-tissue [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] that will receive grafts of autologous adipocyte fat. The recipient site is expanded with an external vacuum tissue-expander applied upon each breast. The biological effect of negative pressure ([[vacuum]]) expansion upon [[soft tissues]] derives from the ability of soft tissues to grow when subjected to controlled, distractive, mechanical forces. (see [[distraction osteogenesis]]) The study ''Non-surgical Breast Enlargement using an External Soft Tissue Expansion System'' (2000) reported the technical effectiveness of recipient-site pre-expansion. In a single-group study, 17 healthy women (aged 18–40 years) wore a brassiere-like vacuum system that applied a 20-mmHg vacuum (controlled, mechanical, distraction force) to each breast for 10–12 hours daily for 10-weeks. Pre- and post-procedure, the breast volume (size) was periodically measured; likewise, a magnetic resonance image ([[MRI]]) of the breast-tissue architecture and water density was taken during the same phase of the patient’s [[menstrual cycle]]; of the 17-woman study group, 12 completed the study, and 5 withdrew, because of non-compliance with the [[clinical trial protocol]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite pmid|10845308}}</ref>

The breast volume (size) of all 17 women increased throughout the 10-week treatment period, the greatest increment was at week 10 (final treatment) — the average volume increase was 98+/–67 per cent over the initial breast-size measures. Incidences of partial recoil occurred at 1-week post-procedure, with no further, significant, breast volume decrease afterwards, nor at the follow-up treatment at 30-weeks post-procedure. The stable, long-term increase in breast size was 55 per cent (range 15–115%). The MRI visualizations of the breasts showed no [[edema]], and confirmed the proportionate enlargement of the adipose and glandular components of the breast-tissue [[Matrix (biology)|matrices]]. Furthermore, a statistically significant decrease in body weight occurred during the study, and [[self-esteem]] questionnaire scores improved from the initial-measure scores.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Because external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues permits injecting large-volume fat grafts (+300cc) to correct defects and enhance the bust, the [[Histology|histologic]] viability of the breast filler (adipocyte fat) and its volume must be monitored and maintained. The long-term, volume maintenance data reported in ''Breast Augmentation using Pre-expansion and Autologous Fat Transplantation: a Clinical Radiological Study'' (2010) indicate the technical effectiveness of external tissue expansion of the recipient site for a 25-patient study group, who had 46 breasts augmented with fat grafts. The indications included [[micromastia]] (underdevelopment), explantation deformity (empty implant pocket), and congenital defects ([[tuberous breast deformity]], [[Poland syndrome|Poland’s syndrome]]).<ref name="Del Vecchio D pp. 68"/>

Pre-procedure, every patient used external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues to create a breast-tissue matrix to be injected with autologous fat grafts of adipocyte tissue, refined via low G-force centrifugation. Pre- and post-procedure, the breast volumes were measured; the patients underwent pre-procedure and 6-month post-procedure [[MRI]] and [[X-ray computed tomography|3-D volumetric imaging]] examinations. At 6-months post-procedure, each woman had a significant increase in breast volume, ranging 60–200 per cent, per the MRI (n=12) examinations. The size, form, and feel of the breasts was natural; post-procedure MRI examinations revealed no oil [[cysts]] or [[Breast diseases|abnormality]] ([[neoplasm]]) in the fat-augmented breasts. Moreover, given the sensitive, biologic nature of breast tissue, periodic MRI and 3-D volumetric imaging examinations are required to monitor the breast-tissue viability and the maintenance of the large volume (+ 300cc) fat grafts.<ref name="Del Vecchio D pp. 68"/>

===Endocrine Approaches===

Breast size naturally increases under the hormonal influence of [[estrogen]] and [[prolactin]] during [[pregnancy]].  These [[physiology|physiological]] effects can be reproduced medically
by exogenous administration of these hormones.
Estrogen is frequently used in some types
of [[oral contraceptive]]s.  These hormones may
also be administered in a [[paracrine]] manner
at lower systemic dosages using very small local hormonal implant devices which slowly release these [[hormone]]s at high concentrations in the surrounding tissue (while maintaining lower dosages in other more distant parts of the body).
(The changes occur physiologically in the surrounding tissue via natural changes not by the volume of the implant).  [[Prolactin]] also promotes [[angiogenesis]] and has antiinflammatory/immunomodulatory properties, potentially improving the longer term success of
fat injection approaches as an adjunct treatment.
Hormonal approaches offer moderate non surgical
augmentation  alternatives utilizing physiological approaches, however, they may be inappropriate in patients for whom the oral contraceptive pill is contraindicated.  Particularly older women with a higher risk of
blood clots, heart disease or some forms of cancer.  (see [[Estrogen]], [[Prolactin]], [[Prolactin receptor]], [[OCP]], [[Hormonal_IUD|Hormonal Implant]]s,[[Endocrinology]],[[Pregnancy]]).

===Indications===
Non-implant breast augmentation with injections of autologous fat grafts (adipocyte tissue) is indicated for woemen requiring [[breast reconstruction]], [[Congenital defect|defect correction]], and the æsthetic enhancement of the bust.

* '''breast reconstruction'''&nbsp;— post-mastectomy re-creation of the breast(s); trauma-damaged tissues (blunt, penetrating), disease ([[breast cancer]]), and explantation deformity (empty breast-implant socket).

* '''congenital defect correction'''&nbsp;— [[micromastia]], [[tuberous breast deformity]], [[Poland Syndrome|Poland’s syndrome]], et cetera.

* '''primary augmentation'''&nbsp;— the aesthetic enhancement (contouring) of the size, form, and feel of the breasts.

The [[operating room]] (OR) time of breast reconstruction, congenital defect correction, and primary breast augmentation procedures is determined by the indications to be treated.

===Procedures===
;Post-mastectomy surgical reconstruction
Surgical post-mastectomy [[breast reconstruction]] requires general anaesthesia, cuts the chest muscles, produces new scars, and requires a long post-surgical recovery for the patient. The surgical emplacement of breast implant devices (saline or silicone) introduces a foreign object to the patient’s body (see [[capsular contracture]]). The [[TRAM flap]] (Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap) procedure reconstructs the breast using an autologous flap of abdominal, cutaneous, and muscle tissues. The latissimus myocutaneous flap employs skin fat and muscle harvested from the back, and a breast implant. The [[DIEP flap]] (Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforators) procedure uses an autologous flap of abdominal skin and fat tissue.<ref name="Khouri RK 2010">Khouri RK (2010) Non-surgical breast reconstruction with autologous fat-grafts</ref>

;Post-mastectomy fat graft reconstruction
The reconstruction of the breast(s) with grafts of autologous fat is a non-implant alternative to further surgery after a breast cancer surgery, be it a [[lumpectomy]] or a breast removal&nbsp;— simple (total) mastectomy, radical mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy, skin-sparing mastectomy, and subcutaneous (nipple-sparing) mastectomy. The breast is reconstructed by first applying external tissue expansion to the recipient-site tissues ([[adipose]], [[gland]]ular) to create a breast-tissue matrix that can be injected with autologous fat grafts (adipocyte tissue); the reconstructed breast has a natural form, look, and feel, and is generally sensate throughout and in the nipple-areola complex (NAC).<ref name="Khouri RK 2010"/> The reconstruction of breasts with fat grafts requires a 3-month treatment period&nbsp;— begun after 3–5 weeks of external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues. The autologous breast-filler fat is harvested by liposuction from the patient’s body (buttocks, thighs, abdomen), is refined and then is injected (grafted) to the breast-tissue matrices (recipient sites), where the fat will thrive.

One method of non-implant breast reconstruction is initiated at the concluding steps of the breast cancer surgery, wherein the [[Oncology|oncological]] surgeon is joined by the reconstructive plastic surgeon, who immediately begins harvesting, refining, and seeding (injecting) fat grafts to the post-mastectomy recipient site. After that initial post-mastectomy fat-graft seeding in the operating room, the patient leaves hospital with a slight '''breast mound''' that has been seeded to become the foundation tissue matrix for the breast reconstruction. Then, after 3–5 weeks of continual external vacuum expansion of the breast mound (seeded recipient-site)&nbsp;— to promote the [[Histology|histologic]] regeneration of the extant tissues ([[adipose|fat]], [[gland]]ular) via increased blood circulation to the mastectomy scar (suture site)&nbsp;— the patient formally undergoes the first fat-grafting session for the reconstruction of her breasts. The external vacuum expansion of the breast mound created an adequate, [[Circulatory system|vascularised]], breast-tissue matrix to which the autologous fat is injected; and, per the patient, such reconstruction affords almost-normal sensation throughout the breast and the nipple-areola complex. Patient recovery from non-surgical fat graft breast reconstruction permits her to resume normal life activities at 3-days post-procedure.<ref name="Khouri RK 2010"/>

;Tissue engineering
;I. — the breast mound
The breast-tissue matrix consists of engineered tissues of complex, implanted, biocompatible scaffolds seeded with the appropriate cells. The ''in-situ'' creation of a tissue matrix in the breast mound is begun with the external vacuum expansion of the mastectomy defect tissues (recipient site), for subsequent seeding (injecting) with autologous fat grafts of adipocyte tissue. The study ''Tissue Engineering a Breast Mound by External Expansion & Autologous Fat Grafting'' (2010), reported that serial fat-grafting to a pre-expanded recipient site achieved (with a few 2-mm incisions and minimally invasive blunt-cannula injection procedures), a non-implant outcome equivalent to a surgical breast reconstrcution by [[DIEP flap|autologous-flap]] procedure. Technically, the external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues created a skin envelope as it stretched the mastectomy scar, and so generated a fertile breast-tissue matrix to which were injected large-volume fat grafts (150–600 ml) to create a breast of natural form, look, and feel.<ref name="ReferenceC">Khouri RK, Cardoso E, Marchi A, Rigotti G. (2010) Tissue Engineering a Breast Mound by External expansion & Autologous fat Grafting</ref>

The fat graft breast reconstructions for 33 women (47 breasts, 14 irradiated), whose clinical statuses ranged from 0-days to 30-years post-mastectomy, began with the pre-expansion of the breast mound (recipient site) with an external vacuum tissue-expander for 10 hours daily, for 10–30 days before the first grafting of autologous fat. The breast mound expansion was adequate when the mastectomy scar tissues stretched to create a 200–300 ml recipient matrix (skin envelope), that received a fat-suspension volume of 150–600 ml in each grafting session.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

At 1-week post-procedure, the patients resumed using the external vacuum tissue-expander for 10 hours daily, until the next fat grafting session; 2–5 outpatient procedures, 6–16 weeks apart, were required until the plastic surgeon and the patient were satisfied with the volume, form, and feel of the reconstructed breasts. The follow-up mammogram and [[MRI]] examinations found neither defects (necrosis) nor abnormalities ([[Breast diseases|neoplasms]]). At 6-months post-procedure, the reconstructed breasts had a natural form, look, and feel, and the stable breast-volumes ranged 300–600 ml per breast. The post-procedure mammographies indicated normal, fatty breasts with well-vascularized fat, and few, scattered, benign oil cysts. The occurred complications included [[pneumothorax]] and transient cysts.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

;II. — Explantation deformity
The autologous fat graft replacement of breast implants (saline and silicone) resolves [[Complications (medical)|medical complications]] such as: [[capsular contracture]], implant shell rupture, filler leakage (silent rupture), device deflation, and silicone-induced [[granulomas]], which are medical conditions usually requiring re-operation and explantation (breast implant removal). The patient then has the option of surgical or non-implant breast corrections, either replacement of the explanted breast implants or fat-graft breast augmentation. Moreover, because fat grafts are biologically sensitive, they cannot survive in the empty implantation pocket, instead, they are injected to and diffused within the breast-tissue matrix (recipient site), replacing approximately 50% of the volume of the removed implant&nbsp;— as permanent breast augmentation. The outcome of the explantation correction is a bust of natural appearance; breasts of volume, form, and feel, that&nbsp;— although approximately 50% smaller than the explanted breast size&nbsp;— are larger than the original breast size, pre-procedure.<ref>Khouri, R.K. (2010) Breast Implants Problems and Risks</ref>

;III. — Breast augmentation
The outcome of a breast augmentation with fat-graft injections depends upon proper patient selection, preparation, and correct technique for recipient site expansion, and the harvesting, refining, and injecting of the autologous breast-filler fat. Technical success follows the adequate external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues (matrix) before the injection of large-volume grafts (220–650 cc) of autologous fat to the breasts. After harvesting by liposuction, the breast-filler fat was obtained by low G-force syringe centrifugation of the harvested fat to separate it, by density, from the crystalloid component. The refined breast filler then was injected to the pre-expanded recipient site; post-procedure, the patient resumed continual vacuum expansion therapy upon the injected breast, until the next fat grafting session. The mean operating room (OR) time was 2-hours, and there occurred no incidences of [[infection]], cysts, [[seroma]], [[hematoma]], or tissue necrosis.<ref name="Del Vecchio D pp. 68">{{cite pmid|21311393}}</ref>

The breast-volume data reported in ''Breast Augmentation with Autologous Fat Grafting: A Clinical Radiological Study'' (2010) indicated a mean increase of 1.2-times the initial breast volume, at 6-months post-procedure. In a 2-year period, 25 patients underwent breast augmentation by fat graft injection; at 3-weeks pre-procedure, before the fat grafting to the breast-tissue matrix (recipient site), the patients were photographed, and examined via intravenous contrast [[MRI]] or [[X-ray computed tomography|3-D volumetric imaging]], or both. The breast-filler fat was harvested by liposuction (abdomen, buttocks, thighs), and yielded fat-graft volumes of 220–650&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> per breast. At 6-months post-procedure, the follow-up treatment included photographs, intravenous contrast MRI or 3-D volumetric imaging, or both. Each woman had an increased breast volume of 250&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> per breast, a mean volume increase confirmed by quantitative MRI analysis. The mean increase in breast volume was 1.2-times the initial breast volume measurements; the statistical difference between the pre-procedure and the 6-month post-procedure breast volumes was (P< 00.0000007); the percentage increase basis of the breast volume was 60–80% of the initial, pre-procedure breast volume.<ref name="Del Vecchio D pp. 68"/>

===Complications and limitations===
In every surgical and non-surgical procedure, the risk of [[Complications (medical)|complications]] exists before, during, and after a procedure, and, given the sensitive biological nature of breast tissues (adipocyte, glandular), this is especially true in the case of fat graft breast augmentation. Despite its relative technical simplicity, the injection (grafting) technique for breast augmentation is accompanied by post-procedure complications&nbsp;— fat necrosis, calcification, and [[Sclerotic fibroma|sclerotic nodules]]&nbsp;— which directly influence the technical efficacy of the procedure, and of achieving a successful outcome. The Chinese study ''Breast Augmentation by Autologous Fat-injection Grafting: Management and Clinical analysis of Complications'' (2009), reported that the incidence of medical complications is reduced with strict control of the injection-rate (cm<sup>3</sup>/min) of the breast-filler volume being administered, and by diffusing the fat-grafts in layers to allow their even distribution within the breast tissue matrix. The complications occurred to the 17-patient group were identified and located with [[X-ray computed tomography|3-D volumetric]] and [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] visualizations of the breast tissues and of any sclerotic lesions and [[Breast disease|abnormal tissue]] masses (malignant neoplasm). According to the characteristics of the defect or abnormality, the sclerotic lesion was excised and liquefied fat was aspirated; the excised samples indicated biological changes in the intramammary fat grafts&nbsp;— fat necrosis, calcification, [[Hyaline|hyalinization]], and [[fibroplasia]].<ref>{{cite pmid|19574890}}</ref>

The [[Complications (medical)|complications]] associated with injecting fat grafts to augment the breasts are like, but less severe, than the medical complications associated with other types of breast procedure. Technically, the use of minuscule (2-mm) incisions and blunt-[[cannula]] injection much reduce the incidence of damaging the underlying breast structures (milk ducts, blood vessels, nerves). Injected fat-tissue grafts that are not perfused among the tissues can die, and result in necrotic cysts and eventual calcifications&nbsp;— medical complications common to breast procedures. Nevertheless, a contoured abdomen for the patient is an additional benefit derived from the liposuction harvesting of the adipocyte tissue injected to the breasts. (see [[abdominoplasty]])

When the patient’s body has insufficient adipocyte tissue to harvest as injectable breast filler, a combination of fat grafting and breast implants might provide the desired outcome. Although non-surgical breast augmentation with fat graft injections is not associated with implant-related medical complications (filler leakage, deflation, visibility, palpability, [[capsular contracture]]), the achievable breast volumes are physically limited; the large-volume, global bust augmentations realised with breast implants are not possible with the method of structural fat grafting. Global breast augmentation contrasts with the controlled breast augmentation of fat-graft injection, in the degree of control that the plastic surgeon has in achieving the desired breast contour and volume. The controlled augmentation is realised by infiltrating and diffusing the fat grafts throughout the breast; and it is feather-layered into the adjacent pectoral areas until achieving the desired outcome of breast volume and contour. Nonetheless, the physical fullness-of-breast achieved with injected fat-grafts does not visually translate into the type of buxom fullness achieved with breast implants; hence, patients who had plentiful fat-tissue to harvest attained a maximum breast augmentation of one [[brassiere|brassiėre cup-size]] in one session of fat grafting to the breast.<ref name=Coleman/>

;Breast cancer
;Detection
A contemporary woman’s life-time probability of developing breast cancer is approximately one in seven;<ref>{{cite pmid|14657533 }}</ref> yet there is no causal evidence that fat grafting to the breast might be more conducive to breast cancer than are other breast procedures; because incidences of fat [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] necrosis and calcification occur in every such procedure: breast [[biopsy]], implantation, [[radiation therapy]], [[Breast reduction plasty|breast reduction]], [[breast reconstruction]], and liposuction of the breast. Nonetheless, detecting breast cancer is primary, and calcification incidence is secondary; thus, the patient is counselled to learn self-palpation of the breast and to undergo periodic mammographic examinations. Although the mammogram is the superior diagnostic technique for distinguishing among cancerous and benign lesions to the breast, any questionable [[lesion]] can be visualized [[Medical ultrasound|ultrasonically]] and [[Magnetic resonance imaging|magnetically]] (MRI); [[biopsy]] follows any clinically suspicious lesion or indeterminate abnormality appeared in a [[radiograph]].<ref name=Coleman/>

;Therapy
Breast augmentation via autologous fat grafts allows the [[Oncology|oncological]] breast surgeon to consider conservative breast surgery procedures that usually are precluded by the presence of alloplastic [[breast implants]], e.g. [[lumpectomy]], if cancer is detected in an implant-augmented breast. In previously augmented patients, aesthetic outcomes cannot be ensured without removing the implant and performing mastectomy.<ref>{{cite pmid|12621177}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|8942907}}</ref> Moreover, [[radiotherapy]] treatment is critical to reducing cancerous recurrence and to the maximal conservation of breast tissue; yet, ironically, radiotherapy of an implant-augmented breast much increases the incidence of [[Complications (medical)|medical complications]]&nbsp;— [[capsular contracture]], infection, extrusion, and poor cosmetic outcome.<ref name=Coleman/>

;Post-cancer breast reconstruction
After mastectomy, surgical breast reconstruction with autogenous [[TRAM flap|skin flaps]] and with breast implants can produce subtle deformities and deficiencies resultant from such global breast augmentation, thus the [[breast reconstruction]] is incomplete. In which case, fat graft injection can provide the missing coverage and fullness, and might relax the [[capsular contracture|breast capsule]]. The fat can be injected as either large grafts or as small grafts, as required to correct difficult axillary deficiencies, improper breast contour, visible implant edges, capsular contracture, and tissue damage consequent to [[radiation therapy]].<ref name=Coleman/>

==Thailand Breast Slap==
The '''Thailand Breast Slap''' is a non-surgical method of breast augmentation endorsed by the [[Thailand|Thai]] government as an alternative to surgical breast augmentation with [[breast implants]]. The Thailand Breast Slap was proposed by beautician Khemmikka Na Sonkhla, who reported that her grandmother used the technique to augment her own bust; proponents also claim it reduces the risk of [[breast cancer]]. The Thai government have enrolled more than 20 women in publicly funded courses for the teaching of the Thailand Breast Slap technique for breast augmentation; nonetheless, beyond Thailand, the technique is not endorsed by the mainstream medical community.<ref>[http://thsnews.com/thailand-breast-slap-government-sponsors-bust-enlargement-program/324640/ Thailand Breast Slap: Government sponsors bust enlargement program&nbsp;– Read New, Latest & Current World News Online Now!].
