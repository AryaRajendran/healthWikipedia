== History ==
Originally known as the '''Robert Roesler de Villiers Foundation''', The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society was founded in [[New York City]] in 1949 by Rudolph and Antoinette de Villiers after the death of their son Robert from leukemia.  The name of the organization was later changed to the '''Leukemia Society of America''' in the 1960s, and later to '''The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society''' in 2000 to reflect the organization's focus on all types of blood cancer.<ref>[http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/all_page?item_id=221384 The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Our History]</ref>

== Research ==
Since its founding, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society has provided more than 600 million dollars for research on blood cancers and has coordinated a nationwide informational clearinghouse for medical professionals, caregivers, and patients.<ref>[http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/all_page?item_id=4414 The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, About Us]</ref> For the organization's 60th anniversary, an organizational goal to transform the lives of people with blood cancer and the healthcare landscape that patients, families and caregivers navigate was established.<ref>[http://www.lls.org/innovation/ The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, 60 Years of Innovations]</ref>

== Advocacy ==
LLS also advocates public policy positions that accelerate progress toward cures for leukemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and myeloma, and to improve the quality of life of those with blood cancer, their friends and families.<ref>

== Fundraising ==
The signature fundraising program, [[Team in Training]] (TNT), is the world's first and largest charity sports training program, raising nearly $1 billion for blood cancer research and patient support since its inception 20 years ago. Additionally, there are yearly endurance events run to benefit the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, including the Rock ‘n’ Roll San Diego Marathon & ½ Marathon, to be held on June 6, 2010. In previous years, [[Nike, Inc.]] has sponsored a Women's Marathon for similarly charitable purposes. 

The largest annual fundraiser is the [[Light The Night Walk]], a non-competitive walk held at various sites throughout the US and Canada, raising funds for blood cancer research and patient support.  Children, adults, and seniors walk carrying illuminated balloons - supporters carry red balloons, survivors and patients carry white balloons, and gold balloons are held in memory of a loved one.

Additionally each year, candidates from communities across the nation engage in a ten-week fundraising competition to earn the titles of [[LLS Man & Woman of the Year]] by raising funds for blood cancer research in honor of local children who are blood cancer survivors, the Boy and Girl of the Year. In 2009, the candidates collectively raised $910,000.<ref>http://www.mwoy.org/nca/</ref>

Nearly 50 LLS chapters also hold a [http://www.leukemiacup.org Leukemia Cup Regatta]. Sailors and local businesses raise funds for the society and then participate in a day or two on the water. In addition to the racing, each Regatta holds several social functions which usually include at least one presentation by a world class sailor. Past speakers have included [[Russell Coutts]], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&search=Terry+Hutchinson&button= Terry Hutchinson,] [[Anna Tunnicliffe]], and [[Gary Jobson]]. Jobson has been the national Honorary Chairperson for the Regatta since 1994 and was diagnosed with lymphoma in 2003. The first Leukemia Cup Regatta was held in 1988 by a group of sailors seeking to honor their friend who had lost his battle with blood cancer. Since then it has grown to a series of events that raise over $3.2 million annually.

In 2008, FarmHouse Fraternity adopted LLS as its International Philanthropy.
