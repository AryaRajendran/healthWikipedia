'''Lurasidone''' (trade name '''Latuda''') is an [[atypical antipsychotic]] developed by [[Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma]].<ref name="pmid19780705">{{cite journal | author = Meyer JM, Loebel AD, Schweizer E | title = Lurasidone: a new drug in development for schizophrenia | journal = Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs | volume = 18| issue = 11| pages = 1715–26| year = 2009 | month = September | pmid = 19780705 | doi = 10.1517/13543780903286388 | url = http://www.informapharmascience.com/doi/abs/10.1517/13543780903286388}}</ref> It was approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for treatment of [[schizophrenia]] on October 28, 2010<ref>{{cite press release | title = FDA approves Latuda to treat schizophrenia in adults | publisher = USFDA | date = 2010-10-28 | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm231512.htm | accessdate = October 29, 2010}}</ref> after a review that found that two of the four Phase III [[clinical trial]]s supported efficacy, while one showed only marginal efficacy and one was not interpretable because of high drop-out rates.<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2010/200603Orig1s000MedR.pdf FDA Clinical Review of lurasidone for the treatment of schizophrenia]</ref> It is currently pending approval for the treatment of [[bipolar disorder]] in the [[United States]].

==Clinical effects==
In [[clinical study|clinical studies]], lurasidone alleviates [[Schizophrenia#Positive_and_negative_symptoms|positive symptoms]] (e.g., [[hallucination]]s, [[delusion]]s) without inducing [[extrapyramidal side effect]]s except for [[akathisia]],<ref name="pmid19497249">{{cite journal | author = Nakamura M, Ogasa M, Guarino J, ''et al.'' | title = Lurasidone in the treatment of acute schizophrenia: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 70 | issue = 6 | pages = 829–36 | year = 2009 | month = June | pmid = 19497249 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.08m04905 | url = http://article.psychiatrist.com/?ContentType=START&ID=10004141}}</ref> despite its potent D<sub>2</sub> antagonistic actions. Effectiveness against negative symptoms of schizophrenia has yet to be established.

Lurasidone may be useful for treating the [[cognition|cognitive]] and [[memory]] [[cognitive deficit|deficit]]s seen in schizophrenia. In animal studies, it reversed [[dizocilpine]]-induced [[learning]] and memory impairment and was found to be superior in doing this to all of the other antipsychotics examined, including [[risperidone]], [[olanzapine]], [[quetiapine]], [[clozapine]], [[aripiprazole]], and [[haloperidol]].<ref name="pmid17662268">{{cite journal | author = Ishiyama T, Tokuda K, Ishibashi T, Ito A, Toma S, Ohno Y | title = Lurasidone (SM-13496), a novel atypical antipsychotic drug, reverses MK-801-induced impairment of learning and memory in the rat passive-avoidance test | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 572 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 160–70 | year = 2007 | month = October | pmid = 17662268 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.06.058 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014-2999(07)00737-6}}</ref><ref name="pmid17881065">{{cite journal | author = Enomoto T, Ishibashi T, Tokuda K, Ishiyama T, Toma S, Ito A | title = Lurasidone reverses MK-801-induced impairment of learning and memory in the Morris water maze and radial-arm maze tests in rats | journal = Behavioural Brain Research | volume = 186 | issue = 2 | pages = 197–207 | year = 2008 | month = January | pmid = 17881065 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbr.2007.08.012 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166-4328(07)00423-8}}</ref> Lurasidone has activity at several [[serotonin receptor]]s that are involved in learning and memory, and unlike most other antipsychotics, lacks any [[anticholinergic]] effects (which are known to impair cognitive processes and memory).<ref name="pmid17662268" /> These properties may underlie its improved effectiveness in treating these symptoms relative to older agents.<ref name="pmid17662268" />

==Side effects==
Side effects are generally similar to other antipsychotics. The drug has a relatively well-tolerated [[side effect]] profile, with low propensity for [[QT interval|QTc interval]] changes, [[weight]], [[lipid]] and [[glucose]]-related adverse effects. Side effects reported in at least 5% of subjects and at least twice the frequency of [[placebo]] include [[akathisia]] (17.6% vs 3.1% placebo), [[somnolence]] (11.7% vs 5.5%), [[parkinsonism]] (6.8% vs 0%), and [[weight gain]] (5.1% vs 2.4%).<ref name="urlwww.ds-pharma.co.jp">{{cite web | url = http://www.ds-pharma.co.jp/english/news/pdf/ne20090826.pdf | author = Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma | title = Lurasidone Demonstrated Efficacy in Treating Patients with Schizophrenia in Pivotal Phase III Study | date = August 26, 2009 }}</ref>

Severe but infrequent side effects include [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] and [[tardive dyskinesia]]. As with other atypical neuroleptics, lurasidone should be used with caution in the elderly because it puts them at an increased risk for a [[stroke]] or [[transient ischemic attack]];<ref name="PrescribingInfo" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/latuda.html|publisher=Drugs.com|title=Latuda|accessdate=2010-12-17}}</ref> however, these risks are not likely to be greater than those associated with antipsychotics of other classes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15169702 |title=Atypical antipsychotics and risk of cerebrovascular accidents |deadurl=no |accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Lurasidone acts as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the following sites:<ref name="pmid17662268" />

* [[alpha-2C adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2C</sub>-adrenergic receptor]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 10.8 nM)
* [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub> receptor]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 1.0 nM)
* [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 0.5 nM)
* [[5-HT7 receptor|5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 0.5 nM)

And as a [[partial agonist]] of the following sites:<ref name="pmid17662268" />

* [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 6.8 nM)

''Note: All values are rounded to the nearest tenth.''

It has only weak or negligible actions at the [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT<sub>2C</sub>]], [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic]], [[H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub>]], and [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|mACh receptor]]s.<ref name="pmid17662268"/>

===Pharmacokinetics===
Lurasidone is metabolized in the liver via the [[enzyme]] [[CYP3A4]].<ref name="PrescribingInfo">{{cite web|url=http://psychotherapeuticdrugs.com/index.php/new-drug-approvals/latuda-lurasidone-hcl|title=Latuda: Prescribing Information|publisher=Psychotherapeutic Drugs|accessdate=2010-12-17}}</ref> This means that its plasma concentrations may be  increased when combined with CYP3A4 inhibitors like [[ketoconazole]] or [[grapefruit juice]], possibly leading to more side effects. Co-administration of CYP3A4 inducers like [[rifampicin]] or [[St. John's wort]] can reduce plasma levels and consequently the effects of the drug.
