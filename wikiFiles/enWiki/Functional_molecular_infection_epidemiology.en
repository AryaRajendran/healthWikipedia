'''Functional Molecular Infection Epidemiology''' ('''FMIE''')<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 19999375 | volume=122 | issue=11-12 | title=[Research on zoonoses: central element of the &quot;One Health&quot; initiative] | year=2009 | author=Wieler LH, Ant&atilde;o EM, Semmler T | journal=Berl.

This can also be defined as the correlation of genetic variations in a pathogen or its respective host with a unique function that is important for disease severity, disease progression, or host susceptibility to a particular pathogen. Functional epidemiology implies not only  descriptive host-pathogen genomic associations, but rather the interplay between pathogen and host genomic variations to functionally demonstrate the role of the genetic variations during infection. 

Functional Molecular Infection Epidemiology differs from classical Molecular Infection Epidemiology mainly in that the latter deals with the tagging and tracking of the infectious agent without much concern for the functional/phenotypic characteristics of the agent being tracked. Functional molecular epidemiology, on the other hand, lays more emphasis on [[Genotype|genotypic]] and [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] correlates of host-pathogen interaction, adaptation or homeostasis. Furthermore, classical molecular epidemiology largely uses “neutral” markers, such as [[insertion sequence]]s and intergenic elements, while functional molecular epidemiology harnesses functionally relevant markers such as [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]]s and genome co-ordinates with putative roles in infection biology – both on the pathogen and the host side. Many studies have been conducted which fit the theme of FMIE - for example, acquisition and transmission of the [[Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis]] and its role in the development of Type-1 [[diabetes mellitus]] when human gene [[SLC11A1]] undergoes particular mutations in a susceptible host.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Paccagnini D, Sieswerda L, Rosu V, ''et al.'' |title=Linking chronic infection and autoimmune diseases: ''Mycobacterium avium'' subspecies paratuberculosis, SLC11A1 polymorphisms and type-1 diabetes mellitus |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=9 |pages=e7109 |year=2009 |pmid=19768110 |pmc=2740822 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007109 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007109}}</ref>

The concept of FMIE has become potentially relevant in the aftermath of multiple [[genome sequencing]] and resequencing of important bacterial pathogens from many different host/patient populations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ahmed N |title=A flood of microbial genomes-do we need more? |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=e5831 |year=2009 |pmid=19513110 |pmc=2688083 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0005831 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005831}}</ref>

A consortium of scientists in India and Germany is (Project BRIDGE) already formed under the aegis of the [[Freie University]] in Berlin and the [[University of Hyderabad]] to explore and investigate the application of FMIE in public health and Veterinary arena.
