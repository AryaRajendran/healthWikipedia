'''Neuroendocrinology''' is the study of the extensive interactions between the [[nervous system]] and the [[endocrine system]], including the biological features of the cells that participate, and how they functionally communicate. The nervous and endocrine systems often act together to regulate the physiological processes of the human body.  Neuroendocrinology arose from the recognition that the brain, especially the [[hypothalamus]], controls secretion of [[pituitary gland]] [[hormone]]s, and has subsequently expanded to investigate numerous interconnections of the endocrine and nervous systems.

Retrieved from http://physrev.physiology.org/content/25/1/171.extract</ref> (1906-1995), of the [[University of Munich]], and a professor at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] co-founded the field of neuroendocrinology with their initial observations and proposals concerning [[neuropeptide]]s.

Annual Review of Neuroscience, 20, 533-566. Retrieved from http://www.dafml.unito.it/anatomy/panzica/neuroendo/articolipdf/1997Raisman.pdf</ref> (1913-1971) is considered by many to be the "father" of neuroendocrinology. Geoffrey Harris, the Dr. Lee's Professor of Anatomy at [[Oxford University]] is credited with showing that the [[anterior pituitary gland]] of [[mammals]] is regulated by factors secreted by hypothalamic [[neuron]]s into the [[hypothalamohypophysial]] [[portal circulation]]. By contrast, the hormones of the [[posterior pituitary gland]] are secreted into the [[systemic circulation]] directly from the nerve endings of hypothalamic neurons.

The first of these factors to be identified are [[thyrotropin-releasing hormone]] (TRH) and [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH). TRH is a small [[peptide]] that stimulates the [[secretion]] of [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH); GnRH (also called luteinising hormone-releasing hormone, LHRH) stimulates the secretion of [[luteinizing hormone]] and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH).

Schally]] of [[Tulane University]] isolated these factors from the hypothalamus of sheep and pigs, and then identified their structures. Guillemin and Schally were awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in Physiology and Medicine in 1977 for their contributions to understanding "the peptide hormone production of the brain."

In 1952, [[Andor Szentivanyi]] of the [[University of South Florida]] and Geza Filipp wrote the world's first research paper showing how neural control of immunity takes place through the hypothalamus.<ref>http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~berczii/dr_szentivanyi_memorial/szentivanyi_memorial.htm</ref>

==Hypothalamus==
The [[endocrine]] system consists of numerous glands throughout the body that produce and secrete [[hormones]] of diverse chemical structure, including [[peptides]], [[steroids]], and [[amine|neuroamines]]. Collectively, hormones regulate many physiological processes.  

[[Oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]]/[[anti-diuretic hormone]], the two [[peptide hormones]] of the [[posterior pituitary gland]] (the neurohypophysis), are secreted from the nerve endings of magnocellular [[neurosecretory neurons]] into the systemic circulation. The cell bodies of these oxytocin and vasopressin neurons are in the [[paraventricular nucleus]] and [[supraoptic nucleus]], respectively, and the electrical activity of these neurons is regulated by afferent synaptic inputs from other brain regions. By contrast, the hormones of the [[anterior pituitary gland]] (the adenohypophysis) are secreted from endocrine cells that, in mammals, are not directly innervated, yet the secretion of these hormones ([[adrenocorticotrophic hormone]] (ACTH), [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH), [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH), [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH), [[prolactin]] and [[growth hormone]]) remains under the control of the brain. The brain controls the anterior pituitary gland by ''releasing factors'' and ''release-inhibiting factors''; these are blood-borne substances released by hypothalamic neurons into blood vessels at the base of the brain, at the [[median eminence]]. These vessels, the hypothalamo-hypophysial portal vessels, carry the hypothalamic factors to the [[Anterior pituitary|adenohypophysis]], where they bind to specific receptors on the surface of the hormone-producing cells. 

For example, the secretion of growth hormone is controlled by two neuroendocrine systems: the [[growth hormone-releasing hormone]] (GHRH) neurons and the [[somatostatin]] neurons, which stimulate and inhibit GH secretion, respectively. The GHRH neurones are located in the [[arcuate nucleus]] of the hypothalamus, whereas the somatostatin cells involved in growth hormone regulation are in the [[periventricular nucleus]]. These two neuronal systems project axons to the median eminence, where they release their [[peptides]] into portal blood vessels for transport to the anterior pituitary. Growth hormone is secreted in pulses, which arise from alternating episodes of GHRH release and somatostatin release, which may reflect neuronal interactions between the GHRH and somatostatin cells, and negative feedback from growth hormone. 

These systems are of great interest to both physiologists and neuroscientists for a variety of reasons.  First, neuroendocrine systems control reproduction<ref>Blazquez, M., Bosma, P. T., Fraser, E.

Second, the neurons of the neuroendocrine system are large; they are mini ''factories'' for producing secretory products; their nerve terminals are large and organised in coherent terminal fields; their output can often be measured easily in the blood; and what these neurons do and what stimuli they respond to are readily open to hypothesis and experiment. Hence, neuroendocrine neurons are good "model systems" for studying general questions, like "how does a neuron regulate the synthesis, packaging, and secretion of its product?" and "how is information encoded in electrical activity?"

==Modern scope==

Today, neuroendocrinology embraces a wide range of topics that arose directly or indirectly from the core concept of neuroendocrine neurons. Neuroendocrine neurons control the [[gonads]], whose [[steroids]], in turn, influence the [[brain]], as do [[corticosteroids]] secreted from the [[adrenal gland]] under the influence of ACTH. The study of these feedbacks became the province of neuroendocrinologists.  The peptides secreted by hypothalamic neuroendocrine neurons into the blood proved to be released also into the brain, and the central actions often appeared to complement the peripheral actions.  So understanding these central actions also became the province of neuroendocrinologists, sometimes even when these peptides cropped up in quite different parts of the brain that appeared to serve functions unrelated to endocrine regulation.  Neuroendocrine neurons were discovered in the [[peripheral nervous system]], regulating, for instance, [[digestion]]. The cells in the [[adrenal medulla]] that release [[adrenaline]] and [[noradrenaline]] proved to have properties between endocrine cells and neurons, and proved to be outstanding model systems for instance for the study of the molecular mechanisms of [[exocytosis]].  And these, too, have become, by extension, ''neuroendocrine'' systems.

Neuroendocrine systems have been important to our understanding of many basic principles in [[neuroscience]] and [[physiology]], for instance, our understanding of [[stimulus-secretion coupling]].<ref>Misler, S. (2009). Unifying concepts in stimulus-secretion coupling in endocrine cells and some implications for therapeutics. Advances in Physiological Education, 33(3), 175-186. Retrieved from http://advan.physiology.org/content/33/3/175.abstract</ref> The origins and significance of patterning in neuroendocrine secretion are still dominant themes in neuroendocrinology today.

Neuroendocrinology is also used as an integral part of understanding and treating [[neurobiological brain disorder]]s. One example is the augmentation of the treatment of mood symptoms with thyroid hormone.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Geracioti TD |title=Identifying Hypothyroidism's Psychiatric Presentations |journal=Current Psychiatry |volume=5 |issue=11|pages=98–117|year=2006|url=http://www.jfponline.com/Pages.asp?AID=4570}}</ref>  Another is the finding of a [[Transthyretin]] (Thyroxine transport) problem in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of some patients diagnosed with schizophrenia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Huang JT, Leweke FM, Oxley D, ''et al.'' |title=Disease Biomarkers in Cerebrospinal Fluid of Patients with First-Onset Psychosis |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=3 |issue=11 |pages=e428 |year=2006 |pmid=17090210 |pmc=1630717 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030428 |url=}}</ref>
