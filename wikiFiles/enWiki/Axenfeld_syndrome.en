==Eponym==
It is named after the German [[ophthalmologist]] [[Theodor Axenfeld]]<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1284}}</ref><ref name=etox>{{cite journal |author=Axenfeld T |title=Embryotoxon cornea posterius |journal=Berichte der Deutschen ophthalmologischen Gesellschaft |year=1920 |volume=42 |pages=301}}</ref> who studied anterior segment disorders, especially those such as Rieger Syndrome and the Axenfeld Anomaly.

The term "Rieger syndrome" is sometimes used to indicate an association with [[glaucoma]].<ref name="titleeMedicine - Glaucoma, Secondary Congenital : Article by Inci Irak-Dersu">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/oph/topic141.htm |title=eMedicine - Glaucoma, Secondary Congenital : Article by Inci Irak-Dersu |accessdate=2008-03-24 |work=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080216204203/http://www.emedicine.com/oph/TOPIC141.HTM| archivedate= 16 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  Rieger Syndrome is by medical definition determined by the presence of malformations of the teeth, the underdevelopment of the anterior segment of the eye, along with the manifestations caused by the Axenfeld anomaly.<ref name="titlewhonamedit - Rieger's Syndrome">{{cite web |url=http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/1283.html |title=whonamedit - Rieger's Syndrome |accessdate=2009-03-06 |work=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090406085451/http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/1283.html| archivedate= 6 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  In addition to these occurrences, a prominent [[Schwalbe's line]], an opaque ring around the cornea known as posterior embryotoxin, [[Glaucoma]] and hypolasia of the iris can occur in the eye.  Other defects such as a lower than average height and stature, a stunt in the development of the mid-facial features and mental deficiencies may be observed.

==Diagnosis==

Although most recognized for its correlation with the onset of [[glaucoma]], the malformation is not limited to the eye, as Axenfeld syndrome when associated with the [[PITX2]] genetic mutation usually presents congenital malformations of the face, teeth, and skeletal system.<ref name=pitx>{{cite journal |pmid=18331556 |year=2008 |month=March |author=Meyer-Marcotty, P; Weisschuh, N; Dressler, P; Hartmann, J; Stellzig-Eisenhauer, A |title=Morphology of the sella turcica in Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome with PITX2 mutation |volume= 37|issue= 8|pages= 504–10|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0714.2008.00650.x |journal=Journal of Oral Pathology & Medicine}}</ref>

The most characteristic feature affecting the eye is a distinct corneal posterior arcuate ring, known as an "embryotoxon".<ref name=etox /> The iris is commonly adherent to the [[Schwalbe's line]] (posterior surface of the cornea).

Analysis of genetic samples from affected patients could result in the discovery of one of the three known genetic mutations which cause the syndrome.  About 40% of Axenfeld-Rieger sufferers display mutations in one of the genes known as [[PAX6]],<ref name="titleRieger Syndrome and PAX6 Deletion">{{cite web |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r8g5531436201365/ |title=Rieger Syndrome and PAX6 Deletion |accessdate=2009-03-06 |format= |work=}}</ref><ref name="pmid11284764">{{cite journal |author=Riise R, Storhaug K, Brøndum-Nielsen K |title=Rieger syndrome is associated with PAX6 deletion |journal=Acta Ophthalmol Scand |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=201–3 |year=2001 |month=April |pmid=11284764 |doi= 10.1034/j.1600-0420.2001.079002201.x|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1395-3907&date=2001&volume=79&issue=2&spage=201}}</ref> [[PITX2]] and [[FOXC1]].

Detection of any of these mutations can give patients a clear diagnosis and post and antenatal procedures such as [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]], [[Chorionic villus sampling]] and [[Amniocentesis]] can be offered to patients.  From here, it is a decision for the prospective parent to decide whether they wish to use the genetic diagnosis that they have acquired to prevent the condition from being passed on to future generations.

==Pathophysiology==

[[Image:Autosomal dominant - en.svg|thumb|right|Axenfeld syndrome has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.]]

The [[molecular genetics]] of Axenfeld syndrome are poorly understood, and centers on three genes identified by cloning of [[chromosomal breakpoints]] from patients.

This disorder is inheritable as an [[autosomal dominant]] trait, which means the defective gene is located on an [[autosome]], and only one copy of the gene is sufficient to cause the disorder when inherited from a parent who has the disorder.  As shown in the diagram, this gives a 50/50 chance of offspring inheriting the condition.
