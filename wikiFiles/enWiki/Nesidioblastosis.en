'''Nesidioblastosis''' is a controversial medical term for [[hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia]] attributed to excessive function of [[pancreas|pancreatic]] [[beta cell]]s with an abnormal [[microscope|microscopic]] appearance. The term was coined in the first half of the 20th century. The abnormal [[histology|histologic]] aspects of the tissue included the presence of islet cell enlargement, islet cell [[dysplasia]], beta cells budding from ductal epithelium, and islets in apposition to ducts.

By the 1970s, nesidioblastosis was primarily used to describe the pancreatic dysfunction associated with persistent [[congenital hyperinsulinism]] and in most cases from the 1970s until the 1980s, it was used as a synonym for what is now referred to as congenital hyperinsulinism. Most congenital hyperinsulinism is caused by different mechanisms than excessive proliferation of beta cells in a fetal pattern and the term fell into disfavor after it was recognized in the late 1980s that the characteristic tissue features were sometimes seen in pancreatic tissue from normal infants and even adults, and is not consistently associated with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. 

However, the term has been resurrected in recent years to describe a form of ''acquired'' hyperinsulinism with beta cell hyperplasia found in adults, especially after gastrointestinal surgery.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Raffel A, Krausch M M, Anlauf M, Wieben D, Braunstein S, Klöppel G, Röher H, Knoefel W |title=Diffuse nesidioblastosis as a cause of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in adults: a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge |journal=Surgery |volume=141 |issue=2 |pages=179–84; discussion 185–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17263973 |doi=10.1016/j.surg.2006.04.015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Clancy T, Moore F, Zinner M |title=Post-gastric bypass hyperinsulinism with nesidioblastosis: subtotal or total pancreatectomy may be needed to prevent recurrent hypoglycemia |journal=J Gastrointest Surg |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=1116–9 |year= 2006 |pmid=16966030 |doi=10.1016/j.gassur.2006.04.008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Raffel A, Anlauf M, Hosch S, Krausch M, Henopp T, Bauersfeld J, Klofat R, Bach D, Eisenberger C, Kloppel G, Knoefel W |title=Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia due to adult nesidioblastosis in insulin-dependent diabetes |journal=World J Gastroenterol |volume=12 |issue=44 |pages=7221–4 |year=2006 |pmid=17131493}}</ref>
