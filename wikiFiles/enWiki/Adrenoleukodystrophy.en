'''Adrenoleukodystrophy'''{{Pronunciation-needed}} (also known as '''X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy''', '''ALD''', '''X-ALD''', '''Adrenomyeloneuropathy''', '''AMN''', '''Siemerling-Creutzfeldt Disease''' or '''Bronze Schilder Disease''') is a disorder of [[peroxisome|peroxisomal]] fatty acid beta oxidation which results in the accumulation of very-long chain fatty acids in tissues throughout the body.  The most severely affected tissues are the [[myelin]] in the [[central nervous system]], the [[adrenal cortex]] and the [[Leydig cells]] in the testes.  Clinically, ALD is a heterogenous disorder, presenting with several distinct [[phenotypes]], and no clear pattern of [[genotype]]-phenotype correlation.  As an X-linked disorder, ALD presents most commonly in males, however approximately 50% of [[heterozygote]] females show some symptoms later in life.  Approximately one-third of ALD patients will present with the childhood cerebral form of the disease, which is the most severe form.  It is characterized by normal development in early childhood, followed by rapid degeneration to a [[vegetative state]].  The other forms of ALD vary in terms of onset and clinical severity, ranging from adrenal insufficiency to progressive [[paraparesis]] in early adulthood (this form of the disease is typically known as adrenomyeloneuropathy).  

ALD is caused by mutations in  ''[[ABCD1]]'', a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein, located on the [[X chromosome]].  The exact mechanism of the pathogenesis of the various forms of ALD is not known.  Biochemically, individuals with ALD show very high levels of unbranched, saturated, very long chain fatty acids, particularly [[cerotic acid]] (26:0).  The level of cerotic acid in plasma does not correlate with clinical presentation.  Treatment options for ALD are limited.  Dietary treatment with [[Lorenzo's oil]] is controversial, and not fully proven.  For the childhood cerebral form, [[stem cell transplant]] and [[gene therapy]] are options if the disease is detected early in the clinical course.  Adrenal insufficiency in ALD patients can be successfully treated.  ALD is the most common peroxisomal inborn error of metabolism, with an incidence estimated between 1:20,000 and 1:50,000.  It does not have a significantly higher incidence in any specific ethnic groups.

==Clinical presentation==
ALD is a clinically heterogeneous disease.  The different clinical presentations are complicated by the pattern of [[X-linked recessive]] inheritance.  There have been seven [[phenotype]]s described in male patients with ''[[ABCD1]]'' mutations and five in females.<ref name=scriver>{{cite book |last1=Moser |first1=Hugo W. |last2=Smith |first2=Kirby D. |last3=Watkins |first3=Paul A.|last4=Powers |first4=James |last5=Moser |first5 = Ann |editor1-first=C.W.|editor1-last=Scriver |editor2-first=A.L.|editor2-last=Beaudet |editor3-first=W.S.|editor3-last=Sly|editor4-first=D.|editor4-last=Valle |others= |title=Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease |edition=8th |year=2004|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York |isbn=  |pages= |chapter=X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy}}</ref>  Initial symptoms in boys affected with the childhood cerebral form of ALD include emotional instability, [[hyperactivity]] and disruptive behavior at school.  Older patients affected with the cerebral form will present with similar symptoms.  Untreated, cerebral ALD is characterized by progressive demyelination leading to a [[vegetative state]] and death.<ref name=bergerreview>{{cite pmid| 16949688 }}</ref>  Adult males with an adrenomyeloneuropathy presentation typically present initially with muscle stiffness, paraparesis and sexual dysfunction.<ref name=genereviews />  All patients with clinically recognized ALD phenotypes are at risk for adrenal insufficiency.<ref name=bergerreview />  There is no reliable way to predict which form of the disease an affected individual will develop, with multiple phenotypes being demonstrated within families.<ref name=omim />  Onset of adrenal insufficiency is often the first symptom, appearing as early as two years of age.<ref name=genereviews>{{cite pmid|20301491}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The clinical presentation of ALD can vary greatly, making diagnosis difficult.  With the variety of phenotypes, clinical suspicion of ALD can result from a variety of different presentations.  Symptoms vary based on the disease phenotype, and even within families or between twins.<ref name=omim>{{cite web|title=#300100 - Adrenoleukodystrophy |url=http://www.omim.org/entry/300100?search=x-ald&highlight=xald |publisher=Johns Hopkins University | accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref>  When ALD is suspected based on clinical symptoms, the initial testing usually includes plasma very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) determination using [[gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]].  The concentration of unsaturated VLCFA, particularly 26 carbon chains are significantly elevated in males with ALD, even prior to the development of other symptoms.<ref name=plasmavlcfa>{{cite pmid|9894883}}</ref> Confirmation of ALD after positive plasma VLCFA determination usually involves molecular genetic analysis of ''ABCD1''.  In females, where plasma VLCFA measurement is not always conclusive (some female carriers will have normal VLCFA in plasma),<ref name=plasmavlcfa>{{cite pmid|9894883}}</ref> molecular analysis is preferred, particularly in cases where the mutation in the family is known.<ref name=scriver /><ref name=genereviews />  Although the clinical phenotype is highly variable among affected males, the elevations of VLCFA are present in all males with an ''ABCD1'' mutation.<ref name=genereviews />

Because the characteristic elevations associated with ALD are present at birth, well before any symptoms are apparent, there have been methods developed<ref name=nbsxald2>{{cite pmid|22197596}}</ref><ref name=nbsxald3>{{cite pmid|19423374}}</ref> in the interests of including it in [[newborn screening]] programs.<ref name=nbsxald>{{cite pmid|18078355}}</ref>  One of the difficulties with ALD as a disease included in universal newborn screening is the difficulty in predicting the eventual phenotype that an individual will express.  The accepted treatment for affected boys presenting with the cerebral childhood form of the disease is a [[bone marrow transplant]], a procedure which carries significant risks.<ref name=bergerreview /><ref name="transplantreview"/>  However, because most affected males will demonstrate adrenal insufficiency, early discovery and treatment of this symptom could potentially prevent complications and allow these patients to be monitored for other treatment in the future, depending on the progression of their disease.<ref name=nbsxald />

The Loes score is a rating of the severity of abnormalities in the brain found on MRI. It ranges from 0 to 34, based on a point system derived from the location and extent of disease and the presence of atrophy in the brain, either localized to specific points or generally throughout the brain. A Loes score of 0.5 or less is classified as normal, while a Loes score of 14 or greater is considered severe. It was developed by neuroradiologist Daniel J. Loes MD and is an important tool in assessing disease progression and the effectiveness of therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Loes |first1=Daniel J. |last2=Hite |first2=S |last3=Moser |first3=H |last4=Stillman |first4=A E |last5=Shapiro |first5=E |last6=Lockman |first6=L |last7=Latchaw |first7=R E |last8=Krivit |first8=W |date=October 1994 |title=Adrenoleukodystrophy: a scoring method for brain MR observations |journal=American Journal of Neuroradiology |volume=15 |issue=9 |pages=1761–1766 |pmid=7847225 |url=http://www.ajnr.org/content/15/9/1761.abstract |accessdate=January 17, 2013}}</ref>

==Genetics==
[[File:ABCD1-gene.svg|220px|right]]
ALD is caused by mutations in ''ABCD1'', located at [[X chromosome|Xq28]], and demonstrates [[X-linked recessive]] inheritance.  Males with an ''ABCD1'' mutation are [[hemizygote|hemizygous]], as they only have a single X chromosome.  Female carriers will typically avoid the most severe manifestations of the disease, but often become symptomatic later in life.<ref name=scriver /> Although, the detection of an ''ABCD1'' mutation identifies an individual who is affected with a form of ALD, however there is no [[genotype]] - [[phenotype]] correlation.<ref name=geno>{{cite pmid|10227685}}</ref>  Within a family, there will often be several different phenotypes, despite the presence of the same causative mutation.  In one case, a family with six affected members displayed five different phenotypes.<ref name=scriver />  There are no common mutations that cause ALD, most are private or familial.  Almost 600<ref name=genereviews /> different mutations have been identified, approximately half are [[missense mutations]], one quarter are [[frameshift mutation|frameshifts]], with in-frame deletions and splicing defects making up the remainder.<ref name=scriver />  The incidence of new mutations in ALD (those occurring spontaneously, rather than being inherited from a carrier parent) is estimated at approximately 4.1%, with the possibility that these are due to [[germline mosaicism]].<ref name=genereviews />

==Pathogenesis==

The exact cause for the varied collection of symptoms found in the different ALD phenotypes is not clear.  The [[white matter]] of the brain, the [[Leydig cells]] of the [[testes]] and the adrenal cortex are the most severely affected systems.<ref name=scriver /> The excess VLCFA can be detected in almost all tissues of the body, despite the localization of symptoms.<ref name=scriver /> Successful treatment of the demyelination process that affects the brain with either stem cell transplant or gene therapy does not immediately normalize the VLCFA levels in body tissues.<ref name="transplantreview"/>  The levels of VLCFA can be normalized by treatment with [[Lorenzo's oil]], but this does not alter the progression of the disease.<ref name=bergerreview />  It is unclear whether the accumulation of VLCFA is associated with the pathogenesis of the disease in a specific way, or if it is a biochemical phenotype, useful for identification.<ref name=scriver />

==Treatment==

===Dietary therapy===
Initial attempts at dietary therapy in ALD involved restricting the intake of very-long chain fatty acids (VLCFA).  Dietary intake is not the only source for VLCFA in the body, as they are also synthesized endogenously.  This dietary restriction did not impact the levels of VLCFA in plasma and other body tissues.<ref name=bergerreview />  After the realization that endogenous synthesis was an important contribution to VLCFA in the body, efforts at dietary therapy shifted to inhibiting these synthetic pathways in the body.  The parents of [[Lorenzo Odone]], a boy with ALD, spearheaded efforts to develop a dietary treatment to slow the progression of the disease.  They developed a mixture of unsaturated fatty acids ([[glyceryl trioleate|glycerol trioleate]] and glyceryl trierucate in a 4:1 ratio), known as [[Lorenzo's oil]] that inhibits elongation of saturated fatty acids in the body.<ref name=bergerreview /><ref name="transplantreview"/> Supplementation with Lorenzo's oil has been found to normalize the VLCFA concentrations in the body, although its effectiveness at treating the cerebral manifestations of the disease are still controversial and unproven.<ref name=oil>{{cite pmid|17901554}}</ref>  Trials with Lorenzo's oil have shown that it does not stop the neurological degradation in symptomatic patients, nor does it improve adrenal function.<ref name=bergerreview />

===Transplant===
While dietary therapy has been shown to be effective to normalize the very-long chain fatty acid concentrations in the plasma of individuals with ALD, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants are the only treatment that can stop the [[demyelination]] that is the hallmark of the cerebral forms of the disease.<ref name=transplantreview>{{cite pmid|20626747}}</ref>  In order to be effective, the transplant must be done at an early stage of the disease; if the demyelination has progressed, transplant can worsen the outcome, and increase the rate of decline.  While transplants have been shown to be effective at halting the demyelination process in those presenting with the childhood cerebral form of ALD, follow-up of these patients has shown that it does not improve adrenal function.<ref name=adrenalfunction>{{cite pmid| 22388279}}</ref>

===Gene therapy===
For patients where an appropriate match for a transplant cannot be found, there have been investigations into the use of [[gene therapy]].  Appropriate [[Vectors in Gene Therapy|vectors]] are selected and modified to express [[wild type]] ''ABCD1'', which is then transplanted into the patients using a similar procedure as for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.<ref name="transplantreview">{{cite pmid|20626747}}</ref>  Gene therapy has only been tried on a small number of patients, mainly in [[France]].  These patients were only considered for gene therapy after there was no [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA match]] for a traditional transplant.  In two reported cases, the gene therapy was successful, with a resolution of the demyelination process up to two years after the procedure.  Although the gene therapy was successful in resolving the neurological symptoms, plasma VLCFA levels remained elevated.<ref name="transplantreview"/>

===Adrenal insufficiency===
Treatment of the adrenal insufficiency that can accompany any of the common male phenotypes of ALD does not resolve any of the neurological symptoms.  Hormone replacement is standard for ALD patients demonstrating adrenal insufficiency.<ref name=peroxleuk>{{cite pmid|22422205}}</ref>  Adrenal insufficiency does not resolve with successful transplant, most patients still require hormone replacement.<ref name=adrenalfunction />

==Incidence==
ALD has not been shown to have an increased incidence in any specific country or ethnic group.  In the United States, the incidence of affected males is estimated at 1:21,000.  Overall incidence of [[hemizygote|hemizygous]] males and [[heterozygote|carrier]] females is estimated at 1:16,800.<ref name=genereviews />  The reported incidence in France is estimated at 1:22,000.<ref name=scriver />
