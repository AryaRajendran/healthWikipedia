'''Familial hypercholesterolemia''' (abbreviated '''FH''', also spelled '''familial hypercholesterolaemia''') is a [[genetic disorder]] characterized by [[hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol levels]], specifically very high levels of [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL, "bad cholesterol"), in the blood and early [[cardiovascular disease]]. Many patients have mutations in the ''LDLR'' gene that encodes the [[LDL receptor]] [[protein]], which normally removes LDL from the circulation, or [[apolipoprotein B]] (ApoB), which is the part of LDL that binds with the receptor; mutations in other genes are rare. Patients who have one abnormal copy (are [[Zygosity|heterozygous]]) of the ''LDLR'' gene may have premature cardiovascular disease at the age of 30 to 40. Having two abnormal copies (being ''homozygous'') may cause severe cardiovascular disease in childhood. Heterozygous FH is a common genetic disorder, inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, occurring in 1:500 people in most countries; homozygous FH is much rarer, occurring in 1 in a million births.<ref name="Rader2003"/>

Heterozygous FH is normally treated with [[statin]]s, [[bile acid sequestrant]]s or other [[hypolipidemic agent]]s that lower cholesterol levels. New cases are generally offered [[genetic counseling]]. Homozygous FH often does not respond to medical therapy and may require other treatments, including [[LDL apheresis]] (removal of LDL in a method similar to [[dialysis]]) and occasionally [[liver transplantation]].<ref name="Rader2003"/>

== Signs and symptoms ==
===Physical signs===
High cholesterol levels normally do not cause any symptoms. Cholesterol may be deposited in various places in the body that are visible from the outside, such as in yellowish patches around the eyelids ([[Xanthelasma|xanthelasma palpebrarum]]), the outer margin of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] ([[Arcus senilis|arcus senilis corneae]]) and in the form of lumps in the [[tendon]]s of the hands, elbows, knees and feet, particularly the [[Achilles tendon]] ([[xanthoma|tendon xanthoma]]).<ref name="Rader2003">{{cite journal |author=Rader DJ, Cohen J, Hobbs HH |title=Monogenic hypercholesterolemia: new insights in pathogenesis and treatment |journal=J.

===Cardiovascular disease===
Accelerated deposition of cholesterol in the walls of [[artery|arteries]] leads to [[atherosclerosis]], the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The most common problem in FH is the development of [[coronary artery disease]] (atherosclerosis of the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]] that supply the [[heart]]) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This may lead to [[angina pectoris]] (chest pain or tightness on exertion) or [[heart attack]]s. Less commonly, arteries of the [[brain]] are affected; this may lead to [[transient ischemic attack]]s (brief episodes of weakness on one side of the body or inability to talk) or occasionally [[stroke]]. [[Peripheral artery occlusive disease]] (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who [[tobacco smoking|smoke]]; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest ([[intermittent claudication]]) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as [[gangrene]]).<ref name=Durrington>{{cite journal |author=Durrington P |title=Dyslipidaemia |journal=Lancet |volume=362 |issue=9385 |pages=717–31 |year=2003 |pmid=12957096 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14234-1}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
===Lipid measurements===
[[Cholesterol]] levels may be determined as part of health screening for [[health insurance]] or [[Occupational safety and health|occupational health]], when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma, xanthoma, arcus are noticed, symptoms of cardiovascular disease develop, or a family member has been found to have FH. A pattern compatible with [[hyperlipoproteinemia type II]]a on the [[Hyperlipidemia#Classification|Fredrickson classification]] is typically found: raised level of total cholesterol, markedly raised level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), normal level of [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL), and normal level of [[triglyceride]]s. The LDL is typically above the 75th [[percentile]], that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level.<ref name="Rader2003"/> Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in FH patients who are also [[obesity|obese]].<ref name=Durrington/>

===Mutation analysis===
On the basis of the isolated high LDL and clinical criteria (which differ by country), genetic testing for LDL receptor mutations and [[ApoB]] mutations can be performed. Mutations are detected in between 50 and 80% of cases; those without a mutation often have higher triglyceride levels and may in fact have other causes for their high cholesterol, such as [[combined hyperlipidemia]] due to [[metabolic syndrome]].<ref name="pmid16825289">{{cite journal |author=van Aalst-Cohen ES |title=Diagnosing familial hypercholesterolaemia: the relevance of genetic testing |journal=Eur. Heart J. |volume=27 |issue=18 |pages=2240–6 |year=2006 |pmid=16825289 |doi= 10.1093/eurheartj/ehl113| url=http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/27/18/2240 |author-separator=, |author2=Jansen AC |author3=Tanck MW |display-authors=3 |last4=Defesche |first4=JC |last5=Trip |first5=MD |last6=Lansberg |first6=PJ |last7=Stalenhoef |first7=AF |last8=Kastelein |first8=JJ}}</ref>

===Differential diagnosis===
FH needs to be distinguished from [[familial combined hyperlipidemia]] and [[polygenic hypercholesterolemia]]. Lipid levels and the presence of xanthomata can confirm the diagnosis. [[Sitosterolemia]] and [[cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis]] are two rare conditions that can also present with premature atherosclerosis and xanthomas. The latter condition can also involve neurological or psychiatric manifestations, [[cataracts]], [[diarrhea]] and skeletal abnormalities.<ref name="pmid11939886">{{cite journal |author=Moghadasian MH, Salen G, Frohlich JJ, Scudamore CH |title=Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: a rare disease with diverse manifestations |journal=Arch.

==Genetics==
The most common genetic defects in FH are ''LDLR'' mutations ([[prevalence]] 1 in 500, depending on the population), ApoB mutations (prevalence 1 in 1000), ''[[PCSK9]]'' mutations (less than 1 in 2500) and ''[[LDLRAP1]]''. The related disease [[sitosterolemia]], which has many similarities with FH and also features cholesterol accumulation in tissues, is due to ''[[ABCG5]]'' and ''[[ABCG8]]'' mutations.<ref name="Rader2003"/>

===LDL receptor===
[[Image:PBB Protein LDLR image.jpg|right|thumb|Schematic representation of the LDL receptor protein.]]
The [[LDL receptor]] [[gene]] is located on the short arm of [[Chromosome 19 (human)|chromosome 19]] (19p13.1-13.3). It comprises 18 [[exon]]s and spans 45 [[base pair#Length measurements|kb]], and the protein gene product contains 839 [[amino acid]]s in mature form. A single abnormal copy (heterozygote) of FH causes cardiovascular disease by the age of 50 in about 40% of cases. Having two abnormal copies (homozygote) causes accelerated atherosclerosis in childhood, including its complications. The plasma LDL levels are inversely related to the activity of LDL receptor (LDLR). Homozygotes have LDLR activity of less than 2%, while heterozygotes have defective LDL processing with receptor activity being 2–25%, depending on the nature of the mutation. Over 1000 different mutations are known.<ref name="Rader2003"/>

There are five major classes of FH due to ''LDLR'' mutations:<ref name=Hobbs1992>{{cite journal |author=Hobbs HH, Brown MS, Goldstein JL |title=Molecular genetics of the LDLR gene in familial hypercholesterolemia |journal=Hum. Mutat. |volume=1 |issue=6 |pages=445–66 |year=1992 |pmid=1301956 |doi=10.1002/humu.1380010602}}</ref>
*Class I: LDLR is not synthesized at all.
*Class II: LDLR is not properly transported from the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] to the [[Golgi apparatus]] for expression on the cell surface.
*Class III: LDLR does not properly bind LDL on the cell surface because of a defect in either apolipoprotein B100 (R3500Q) or in LDL-R.
*Class IV: LDLR bound to LDL does not properly cluster in [[clathrin]]-coated pits for [[receptor-mediated endocytosis]].
*Class V: LDLR is not recycled back to the cell surface.

===ApoB===
ApoB, in its ApoB100 form, is the main [[Apolipoprotein|apoprotein]], or protein part of the lipoprotein particle. Its gene is located on the [[chromosome 2 (human)|second chromosome]] (2p24-p23) and is between 21.08 and 21.12&nbsp;[[megabase|Mb]] long. FH is often associated with the mutation of R3500Q, which causes replacement of arginine by glutamine at position 3500. The mutation is located on a part of the protein that normally binds with the LDL receptor, and binding is reduced as a result of the mutation. Like ''LDLR'', the number of abnormal copies determines the severity of the hypercholesterolemia.<ref name="Rader2003"/><ref name=Grundy1986>{{cite journal |author=Vega GL, Grundy SM |title=In vivo evidence for reduced binding of low density lipoproteins to receptors as a cause of primary moderate hypercholesterolemia |journal=J.

===PCSK9===
Mutations in the [[PCSK9|proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9]] (''PCSK9'') gene were linked to autosomal dominant (i.e. requiring only one abnormal copy) FH in a 2003 report.<ref name="Rader2003"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Abifadel M |title=Mutations in PCSK9 cause autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia |journal=Nat.

It has been suggested that PCSK9 causes FH mainly by reducing the number of LDL receptors on liver cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Seidah NG, Khatib AM, Prat A |title=The proprotein convertases and their implication in sterol and/or lipid metabolism |journal=Biol. Chem. |volume=387 |issue=7 |pages=871–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16913836 |doi=10.1515/BC.2006.110| url=http://www.atypon-link.com/WDG/doi/pdf/10.1515/BC.2006.110|format=PDF}}</ref>

===LDLRAP1===
Abnormalities in the ''ARH'' gene, also known as ''[[LDLRAP1]]'', were first reported in a family in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Khachadurian AK, Uthman SM |title=Experiences with the homozygous cases of familial hypercholesterolemia. A report of 52 patients |journal=Nutr Metab |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=132–40 |year=1973 |pmid=4351242 |doi=10.1159/000175431}}</ref> In contrast to the other causes, two abnormal copies of the gene are required for FH to develop (autosomal recessive). The mutations in the protein tend to cause the production of a shortened protein. Its real function is unclear, but it seems to play a role in the relation between the LDL receptor and clathrin-coated pits. Patients with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia tend to have more severe disease than ''LDLR''-heterozygotes but less severe than ''LDLR''-homozygotes.<ref name="Rader2003"/>

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:HMG-CoA reductase pathway.png|right|thumb|Cholesterol is synthesized in the [[HMG-CoA reductase pathway]].]]
{{main|LDL receptor|atherosclerosis}}

LDL cholesterol normally circulates in the body for 2.5 days, and subsequently binds to the LDL receptor on the [[hepatocyte|liver cells]], undergoes [[endocytosis]], and is digested. LDL is removed, and synthesis of [[cholesterol]] by the liver is suppressed in the [[Mevalonate pathway|HMG-CoA reductase pathway]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brown MS, Goldstein JL |title=Familial hypercholesterolemia: defective binding of lipoproteins to cultured fibroblasts associated with impaired regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=788–92 |year=1974 |pmid=4362634 |doi=10.1073/pnas.71.3.788 |pmc=388099}}</ref> In FH, LDL receptor function is reduced or absent, and LDL circulates for an average duration of 4.5 days, resulting in significantly increased level of LDL cholesterol in the blood with normal levels of other lipoproteins.<ref name=Durrington/> In mutations of ''ApoB'', reduced binding of LDL particles to the receptor causes the increased level of LDL cholesterol. It is not known how the mutation causes LDL receptor dysfunction in mutations of ''PCSK9'' and ''ARH''.<ref name="Rader2003"/>

Although atherosclerosis occurs to a certain degree in all people, FH patients may develop accelerated atherosclerosis due to the excess level of LDL. The degree of atherosclerosis approximately depends of the ''number'' of LDL receptors still expressed and the ''functionality'' of these receptors. In many heterozygous forms of FH, the receptor function is only mildly impaired, and LDL levels will remain relatively low. In the more serious homozygous forms, the receptor is not expressed at all.<ref name="Rader2003"/>

Some studies of FH cohorts suggest that additional risk factors are generally at play when an FH patient develops atherosclerosis.<ref name="Broome1993">{{cite journal |author=Scientific Steering Committee on behalf of the Simon Broome Register Group  |title=Risk of fatal coronary heart disease in familial hypercholesterolaemia |journal=BMJ |volume=303 |issue=6807 |pages=893–6 |year=1991 |pmid=1933004 |doi=10.1136/bmj.303.6807.893 |pmc=1671226}}</ref><ref name=Sijbrands2001>{{cite journal |author=Sijbrands EJ, Westendorp RG, Defesche JC, de Meier PH, Smelt AH, Kastelein JJ |title=Mortality over two centuries in large pedigree with familial hypercholesterolaemia: family tree mortality study |journal=BMJ |volume=322 |issue=7293 |pages=1019–23 |year=2001 |pmid=11325764 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/322/7293/1019 |doi=10.1136/bmj.322.7293.1019 |pmc=31037}}</ref> In addition to the classic risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes, genetic studies have shown that a common abnormality in the [[prothrombin]] gene (G20210A) increases the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with FH.<ref name="pmid15879303">{{cite journal |author=Jansen AC |title=Genetic determinants of cardiovascular disease risk in familial hypercholesterolemia |journal=Arterioscler.

==Screening==
Although [[case finding]] among family members of patients with known FH is a [[cost-effective]] approach, other strategies such as [[universal screening]] at the age of 16 have also been suggested.<ref name="BMJ-screening">{{cite journal |author=Marks D, Wonderling D, Thorogood M, Lambert H, Humphries SE, Neil HA |title=Cost effectiveness analysis of different approaches of screening for familial hypercholesterolaemia |journal=BMJ |volume=324 |issue=7349 |pages=1303 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12039822 |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7349.1303 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/324/7349/1303 |pmc=113765}}</ref><ref name="pmid11213091">{{cite journal |author=Umans-Eckenhausen MA, Defesche JC, Sijbrands EJ, Scheerder RL, Kastelein JJ |title=Review of first 5 years of screening for familial hypercholesterolaemia in the Netherlands |journal=Lancet |volume=357 |issue=9251 |pages=165–8 |year=2001 |month=January |pmid=11213091 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)03587-X}}</ref> The latter approach may however be less cost-effective in the short term.<ref name="pmid12669918">{{cite journal |author=Marks D, Thorogood M, Neil HA, Wonderling D, Humphries SE |title=Comparing costs and benefits over a 10 year period of strategies for familial hypercholesterolaemia screening |journal=J Public Health Med |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=47–52 |year=2003 |month=March |pmid=12669918 |doi=10.1093/pubmed/fdg010 |url=http://jpubhealth.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/25/1/47 | format=PDF}}</ref> Screening at an age lower than 16 would lead to an unacceptably high rate of [[Type I and type II errors|false positives]].<ref name=Durrington/>

==Treatment==
=== Heterozygous FH ===
FH is usually treated with [[statin]]s. Statins act by inhibiting the enzyme [[HMG-CoA reductase|hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase]] (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the liver. In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively lower cholesterol and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other drugs is required, such as [[bile acid sequestrant]]s ([[cholestyramine]] or [[colestipol]]), [[nicotinic acid]] preparations or fibrates.<ref name="Rader2003"/> Control of other risk factors for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled. Professional guidelines recommend that the decision to treat an FH patient with statins should not be based on the usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the [[Framingham Heart Study]]), as they are likely to underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease; unlike the rest of the population, FH have had high levels of cholesterol since birth, probably increasing their relative risk.<ref name=NICE>{{NICE|71|Familial hypercholesterolaemia|2008}}</ref> Prior to the introduction of the statins, [[clofibrate]] (an older fibrate that often caused [[gallstone]]s), [[probucol]] (especially in large xanthomas) and [[thyroxine]] were used to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.

More controversial is the addition of [[ezetimibe]], which inhibits cholesterol absorption in the gut. While it reduces LDL cholesterol, it does not appear to improve a marker of atherosclerosis called the [[intima-media thickness]]. Whether this means that ezetimibe is of no overall benefit in FH is unknown.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kastelein JJ |title=Simvastatin with or without ezetimibe in familial hypercholesterolemia |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=358 |issue=14 |pages=1431–43 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18376000 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0800742 |author-separator=, |author2=Akdim F |author3=Stroes ES |display-authors=3 |last4=Zwinderman |first4=Aeilko H. |last5=Bots |first5=Michiel L. |last6=Stalenhoef |first6=Anton F.H. |last7=Visseren |first7=Frank L.J. |last8=Sijbrands |first8=Eric J.G. |last9=Trip |first9=Mieke D.}}</ref>

There are no interventional studies that directly show mortality benefit of cholesterol lowering in FH patients. Rather, evidence of benefit is derived from a number of trials conducted in people who have polygenic hypercholesterolemia (in which heredity plays a smaller role). Still, a 1999 observational study of a large British registry showed that mortality in FH patients had started to improve in the early 1990s, when statins were introduced.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Scientific Steering Committee on behalf of the Simon Broome Register Group | title=Mortality in treated heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: implications for clinical management | journal=Atherosclerosis | year=1999 | volume=142 | issue=1 | pages=105–12 | doi=10.1016/S0021-9150(98)00200-7 | pmid=9920511}}</ref>

The latest research published in 2008 based on the largest cohort of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia with over 44 000 person-years exposure in adulthood, suggested that treatment of FH with statins led to a 48% reduction in death from coronary heart disease, to a point where people with FH are no more likely to die of coronary heart disease than the general population. However if the patient already had coronary heart disease the reduction was 25%. The results emphasize the importance of early identification of FH and treatment with statins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Neil A, Cooper J, Betteridge J, ''et al.'' |title=Reductions in all-cause, cancer, and coronary mortality in statin-treated patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: a prospective registry study |journal=Eur.

=== Homozygous FH ===
Homozygous FH is harder to treat. The LDL receptors are minimally functional, if at all. Only high doses of statins, often in combination with other medications, are modestly effective in improving lipid levels.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Marais AD, Blom DJ, Firth JC |title=Statins in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia |journal=Curr Atheroscler Rep |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=19–25 |year=2002 |month=January |pmid=11772418 |doi=10.1007/s11883-002-0058-7}}</ref> If medical therapy is not successful at reducing cholesterol levels, [[LDL apheresis]] may be used; this filters LDL from the bloodstream in a process reminiscent of [[dialysis]].<ref name="Rader2003"/> Very severe cases may be considered for a [[liver transplant]]; this provides a liver with normally functional LDL receptors, and leads to rapid improvement of the cholesterol levels, but at the risk of complications from any solid [[organ transplant]] (such as [[Transplant rejection|rejection]], [[infection]]s, or [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]] of the medication required to suppress rejection).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM198412273112603 |author=Bilheimer DW, Goldstein JL, Grundy SM, Starzl TE, Brown MS |title=Liver transplantation to provide low-density-lipoprotein receptors and lower plasma cholesterol in a child with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia |journal=N.

==Epidemiology==
In most populations studied, heterozygous FH occurs in about 1:500 people, but not all develop symptoms.<ref name="Rader2003"/> Homozygous FH occurs in about 1:1,000,000.<ref name="Rader2003"/><ref name=Durrington/>

''LDLR'' mutations are more common in certain populations, presumably because of a genetic phenomenon known as the ''[[founder effect]]''—they were founded by a small group of individuals, one or several of whom was a carrier of the mutation. The [[Afrikaner]], [[French Canadian]]s, [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[Christian]]s, and [[Finns]] have high rates of specific mutations that make FH particularly common in these groups. ''APOB'' mutations are more common in Central Europe.<ref name="Rader2003"/>

==History==
The Norwegian physician Dr C. Müller first associated the physical signs, high cholesterol levels and autosomal dominant inheritance in 1938.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Müller C|title=Xanthoma, hypercholesterolemia, angina pectoris|journal=Acta Med Scandinav|year=1938|volume=95 Suppl|issue=89|pages=75 |doi=10.1111/j.0954-6820.1938.tb19279.x}}</ref> In the early 1970s and 1980s, the genetic cause for FH was described by Dr [[Joseph L. Goldstein]] and Dr [[Michael S. Brown]] of Dallas, Texas. Initially, they found increased activity of HMG-CoA reductase, but studies showed that this did not explain the very abnormal cholesterol levels in FH patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goldstein JL, Brown MS |title=Familial hypercholesterolemia: identification of a defect in the regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity associated with overproduction of cholesterol |journal=Proc.
