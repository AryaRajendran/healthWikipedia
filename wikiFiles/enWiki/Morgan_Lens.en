The '''Morgan Lens''' is a [[Asepsis|sterile]] [[plastic]] device resembling a [[contact lens]] connected to [[Tube (fluid conveyance)|tubing]] that fits over the [[Human eye|eye]] and allows copious [[Therapeutic irrigation|irrigation]] of the eye over time without continuous attendance by [[Health care provider|medical personnel]].<ref>[http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=48796 Definition from medilexicon.com]</ref>

==History==

The Morgan Lens was developed by [[Loran B. Morgan]], a [[United States]] [[Ophthalmology|ophthamologist]].<ref name="morganlens">[http://www.morganlens.com/ Home page of www.morganlens.com]</ref>  During Morgan's third [[Vietnam War]] tour as a volunteer physician, he concluded that many serious [[Eye injury|eye problems]] developed in individuals because fairly simple [[infection]]s had not been treated adequately.<ref name="morganlens" />  Morgan noted that to protect the eye from being severely infected, it was necessary to have a means for steadily delivering sterile fluid or medication to the eye.<ref name="morganlens" />  Morgan noted that, especially in a war zone or an emergency room, medical personnel rarely had the time to continue administering [[eye drop]]s to a patient continuously for a long enough period of time to thoroughly cleanse an irritated or infected eye.<ref name="morganlens" />

As such, in February 1969, in [[Vinh Long]], Morgan molded a simple device for cleaning the eye.<ref name="morganlens_a">[http://www.morganlens.com/wyoming.html Zeke Scher, "The Wyoming Doctor Who Saves Eyes", ''Denver Post'', Feb. 20, 1972]</ref>  Morgan was familiar with contact lenses (wearing them himself and often prescribing them to his patients), and his first Morgan Lens was larger than a modern contact lens, resembling the early contact lenses of the 1940s.<ref name="morganlens_a" />  Morgan initially called the device the '''Therapeutic Lens Corneal''', later renaming it the '''Morgan Medi-Flow Lens'''.<ref name="morganlens_a" />  Later versions of the Morgan Lens were smaller and contained directional fins.<ref name="morganlens_b">[http://www.morganlens.com/faq.html FAQs from Morgan Lens website]</ref>

==Function==

The Morgan Lens provides ocular irrigation or medication to the [[cornea]] and [[conjunctiva]].<ref name="morganlens_b" />  Once inserted, the Morgan Lens floats on the layer of solution it is delivering, never actually touching the cornea.<ref name="morganlens_b" />

When inserting the Morgan Lens, a [[topical anesthetic]] is first applied to the eye.<ref name="ci.corvallis">[http://www.ci.corvallis.or.us/downloads/fire/protocols/Section%20III%20Procedures/Morgan%20Lens%20v6.08.pdf Oregon Health Dept. guide to Morgan Lens]</ref>  The Morgan Lens is attached to the solution (contained in a bag resembling the bag commonly used in [[intravenous therapy]] or in a [[syringe]]).<ref name="ci.corvallis" />  After the solution has begun flowing, the medical provider has the patient look down and inserts the lens under the upper [[eyelid]], then has the patient look up and inserts the lens under the lower eyelid.<ref name="ci.corvallis" />   

After insertion, which usually takes less than 30 seconds, medical personnel do not need to attend the patient while the Morgan Lens cleanses the patient's eye.<ref name="morganlens_b" /> 

Also, after insertion, the patient is able to close his or her eyelids while the eye is cleansed.<ref name="morganlens_b" />  This provides a distinct advantage over manual methods of cleansing the eye (such as inserting eye drops) which require the patient to keep the eye open for an extended period of time and which can be very painful to the patient because of an injured patient's natural reaction of closing the eye in response to injury ([[blepharospasm]]) as well as the increased [[Photosensitivity in humans|light sensitivity]] of injured eyes.<ref name="morganlens_b" />

==Uses==

The Morgan Lens can be used in many situations requiring ocular irrigation or the application of medicine to the eye, including cases of [[Chemical eye injury|chemical eye burns]], [[Burn|thermal burns]], [[Irritation|irritants]] (e.g. [[gasoline]], [[detergent]]), non-embedded [[Foreign body|foreign bodies]], foreign body sensation with no visible foreign body, routine cleansing prior to [[eye surgery]] or [[Eyelid#Eyelid_surgeries|eyelid surgery]], or for infections.<ref>[http://www.morganlens.com/ppt.html PowerPoint presentation from Morgan Lens' manufacturer]</ref>

The Morgan Lens is a standard piece of [[medical equipment]]; according to its manufacturer, 95% of U.S. [[Emergency department|emergency rooms]] contain a Morgan Lens.<ref>[http://www.morganlens.com/ Home page of www.morganlens.com], [http://healthcare.zibb.com/trademark/the+morgan+lens+mortan+inc./29744201 Profile of MorTan, Inc. on healthcare.zibb.com]</ref>

==Manufacture==

The Morgan Lens is made by MorTan, Inc., which is based in [[Missoula, Montana]], and headed by Loran Morgan's son, Daniel Morgan.<ref>[http://www.zapconnect.com/companies/index.cfm/fuseaction/companies_detail/eregnum/1718285.html Profile from zapconnect.com]</ref>
