[[Headaches]] can be attributed to many different substances.  Some of these include [[alcohol]], [[Nitric oxide|NO]], [[carbon monoxide poisoning]], [[cocaine]], [[caffeine]] and [[monosodium glutamate]].  Chronic use of certain medications used to treat headaches can also start causing headaches, known as medication overuse headaches.  Headaches may also be a symptoms of medication withdrawal.

==Classification==
These headaches have been further sub classified by the ICHD2<ref name=ICHD2>{{cite web |url=http://216.25.100.131/ihscommon/guidelines/pdfs/ihc_II_main_no_print.pdf |title=216.25.100.131 |format=PDF |work=the Headache Classification Subcommittee of the International Headache Society |accessdate=}}</ref> into

*Headaches induced by acute substance use or exposure
*[[Medication overuse headaches]] (MOH)
*Headaches attributed to chronic medication use
*Headaches attributed to substance withdrawal

== Causes ==

A number of different causes contribute to this class of headache.  Several common chemicals may be the culprit. [[Nitrite]] compounds dilate blood vessels, causing dull and pounding headaches with repeat exposure. Nitrite is found in dynamite, heart medicine and it is a chemical used to preserve meat (ergo these being known as "nitrite" or "hot dog" headaches).<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Symptom-Diagnosis-Evidence-Clinical-ebook/dp/B005C3WUPS/tag=circuitblue-20 Symptom to Diagnosis: An Evidence Based Guide, (Amazon Kindle, Second Edition)]</ref> Eating foods prepared with [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG) may thus result in headache. [[Acetaldehyde]] from [[alcohol]] may also cause a headache either acutely or after a number of hours ([[hangover]]).

Poisons, like [[carbon tetrachloride]] found in [[insecticides]] and [[lead]] can also cause headaches with repeated exposure. Ingesting lead paint or having contact with lead batteries can cause headaches, and so can exposure to materials that contain chemical solvents, like [[benzene]], which are found in [[turpentine]], spray adhesives, rubber cement, and inks. Headaches are also a symptom of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].

Drugs such as amphetamines can cause headaches as a side effect. Another type of drug-related headache occurs during withdrawal from long-term therapy with the antimigraine drug [[ergotamine tartrate]].  This is more commonly known as [[rebound headache]], although some sources use the term interchangeably.

==Diagnosis==
Headaches due to environmental causes are usually diagnosed by taking an exposure history.

== Treatment ==
These headaches are treated by determining the cause of the headache and treating or removing this cause
