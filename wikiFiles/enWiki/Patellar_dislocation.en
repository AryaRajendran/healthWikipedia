<!-- What is it, and how severe? -->
'''Patella dislocation''' is an injury of the [[knee]], typically caused by a direct blow or a sudden twist of the leg.<ref name=dath2006>Dath, R., Chakravarthy, J., & Porter K.M. (2006)</ref>  It occurs when the [[patella]] (kneecap) slips out of its normal position in the [[patella surface of femur|patellofemoral groove]], and generally causes intense pain with [[effusion]].<ref name=dath2006>Patella Dislocations.

<!-- How is treatment handled? -->
The patella generally dislocates laterally, and can be accompanied by acute pain and disability.  Immediate reduction can be accomplished by hyperextension of the knee, and providing a medialward pressure to move the patella back into the patellofemoral groove. Hyperextension of the knee on its own could possibly move the patella into place, because this motion locks the knee in place. When the knee is locked the ligaments are twisted and taut, allowing the muscles involved to relax and the patella to slide back into place.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hirata|first=Isao|title=The doctor and the athlete|year=1974|publisher=J.

==Anatomy of the knee==
{{Main|Knee}}
[[Image:Knee diagram.svg|thumb|250px|right|Anatomy of the Knee]]
The patella is a triangular sesamoid bone, which is embedded in the tendon, and rests in the patellofemoral groove, an [[articular cartilage]]-lined hollow at the end of the thigh bone ([[femur]]) where the thigh bone meets the shin bone ([[tibia]]). Several [[ligament]]s and [[tendon]]s hold the patella in place and allow it to move up and down the patellofemoral groove when the leg bends. The top of the patella attaches to the quadriceps muscle via the [[quadriceps tendon]],<ref name=dath2006/> the middle to the [[vastus medialis obliquus (VMO)]] and [[vastus lateralis]] muscles, and the bottom to the head of the tibia ([[Tuberosity of the tibia|tibial tuberosity]]) via the [[patellar tendon]], which is a continuation of the quadriceps femoris tendon.<ref>{{cite book|last=Saladin|first=Kenneth S.|title=Anatomy & physiology : the unity of form and function|year=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-337825-1|pages=268|edition=6th ed.}}</ref> The [[medial patellofemoral ligament]] attaches horizontally in the inner knee to the [[adductor magnus tendon]] and is the structure most often damaged during a patellar dislocation. Finally, the [[lateral collateral ligament]] and the [[medial collateral ligament]] stabilize the patella on either side.<ref name=dath2006/> Any of these structures can sustain damage during a patellar dislocation.

==Mechanism of injury==
Patellar dislocations occur by:
* A direct impact that knocks the patella out of joint
* A twisting motion of the knee
* A sudden lateral cut <ref name=dath2006/>

==Predisposing factors==

{{Empty section|date=December 2012}}

==Data:Sex,Age and Race==
In a journal by the Department of [[Orthopaedic Surgery]], Brian Waterman collected incidence rate data in respect to sex, age and race in the U.S. Patellar dislocations have been estimated to occur among an at risk –population of 1,774,210,081 people per year.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Waterman | first1 = BR. | last2 = Belmont | first2 = PJ. | last3 = Owens | first3 = BD. | title = Patellar dislocation in the United States: role of sex, age, race, and athletic participation. | journal = J Knee Surg | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–7 | month = Mar | year = 2012 | doi =  | PMID = 22624248 }}</ref> The breakdown of the incidence rates found in AM J [[sports medicine]] journal, among the ages of 10–17 years old were found to be about 29 per 100,000 persons per year, while the adult population average for this type of injury ranged between 5.8 and 7.0 per 100,000 persons per year.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fithian | first1 = DC. | last2 = Paxton | first2 = EW. | last3 = Stone | first3 = ML. | last4 = Silva | first4 = P. | last5 = Davis | first5 = DK. | last6 = Elias | first6 = DA. | last7 = White | first7 = LM. | title = Epidemiology and natural history of acute patellar dislocation. | journal = Am J Sports Med | volume = 32 | issue = 5 | pages = 1114–21 | month =  | year =  | doi = 10.1177/0363546503260788 | PMID = 15262631 }}</ref> The highest rates for this type of injury were found in the youngest age groups, while the rates declined with increasing ages.Race is a significant factor for this injury, where Hispanics, African-Americans and Caucasians had slightly higher rates of patellar dislocation due to the types of athletic activity involved in [[basketball]] 18.2%, [[soccer]] 6.9% and [[football]] 6.9%, according to Brian Waterman.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Gender===
* Females are more susceptible to patellar dislocation.

===Athletic Population<ref name=atkin2008/>===

* Patellar dislocation occurs in sports that involve rotating the knee.
* Direct trauma to the knee can knock the patella out of joint.

=== Positive Family History===
* Twenty-four percent of patients whose patellas have dislocated have relatives who have experienced patellar dislocations.<ref name=dath2006/>

===Anatomical Factors===

====Excessive Q-angle====
* The manual of Structural [[Kinesiology]] by B.T Floyd states that people who have larger Q-angles tend to be more prone to having knee injuries such as dislocations, due to the central line of pull found in the [[quadriceps muscles]] that run from the [[anterior superior iliac spine]] to the center of the patella. The range of a normal Q angle for men ranges from <15 degrees and for females <20 degrees, putting females at a higher risk for this [[injury]].<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Floyd | first1 = R. T. | title = Manual of structural kinesiolog | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Higher Education | location = Boston | isbn = 978-0-07-337643-1 | pages =  }}</ref> Having an angle greater than 25 degrees between the patellar tendon and quadriceps muscle can predispose someone to patellar dislocation.<ref name=buchner2005>{{cite journal |author=Buchner M, Baudendistel B, Sabo D, Schmitt H |title=Acute traumatic primary patellar dislocation: long-term results comparing conservative and surgical treatment |journal=Clin J Sport Med |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=62–6 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15782048 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1050-642X&volume=15&issue=2&spage=62 |doi=10.1097/01.jsm.0000157315.10756.14}}</ref>

====Misalignment of the patella on the knee joint====
* In [[patella alta]], the patella sits higher on the knee than normal.<ref name=buchner2005/>

====Insufficient Vastus Medialis Obliquus Muscle (VMO)<ref name=dath2006/>====
* Normal function of the VMO muscle stabilizes the patella.
* If VMO function is decreased, it will result in instability of the patella.

==Symptoms and signs==

Patients often describe pain as being “inside the knee cap.” The leg tends to flex even when relaxed.<ref name=dath2006/>

To assess the knee, a clinician can perform the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXmjYVDkmVg&feature=related Patellar Apprehension Test] by moving the patella back and forth while the patient flexes the knee at approximately 30 degrees.<ref name=bruknerKhan2006/>

The patient can do the ''patella tracking assessment'' by making a single leg squat and standing, or, lying on his or her back with knee extended from flexed position. A patella that slips medially on early flexion is called the {{visible anchor|J sign}}, and indicates imbalance between the VMO and lateral structures.<ref>[http://www.fpnotebook.com/Ortho/Exam/PtlTrckngAsmnt.htm Family Practice Notebook > Patella Tracking Assessment] by Scott Moses, last revised before 5/10/08</ref>

===Risks===
A risk that causes patellar symptoms can be known as the lateral patellar compression syndrome, which can be caused from lack of balance or inflammation in the joints.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Ficat | first1 = R. Paul. | last2 = Hungerford | first2 = David S. | title = Disorders of the patello-femoral join | year = 1977 | publisher = Williams  Wilkins | location = Baltimore | isbn = 0-683-03200-3 | pages =  }}</ref> The [[pathophysiology]] of the kneecap is complex and it deals with the osseous soft tissue or abnormalities within the patellofemoral groove. The patellar symptoms cause knee extensor [[dysplasia]] and sensitive small variations affect the muscular mechanism that controls the joint movements.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Zaffagnini | first1 = Stefano. | last2 = Dejour | first2 = David. | last3 = Arendt | first3 = Elizabeth A. (Elizabeth Anne) | title = Patellofemoral pain, instabilty, and arthritis : clinical presentation, imaging, and treatmen | year = 2010 | publisher = Springer | location = Heidelberg ; New York | isbn = 978-3-642-05423-5 | pages =  }}</ref>

===Forces===
When there is too much tension on the patella, the ligaments will weaken and be susceptible to tearing ligaments or tendons due to shear force or torsion force, which then displaces the kneecap from its origination. Another cause that patellar dislocation can occur is when the trochlear groove that has been completely flattened is defined as [[trochlear]] dysplasia.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Dejour | first1 = H. | last2 = Walch | first2 = G. | last3 = Nove-Josserand | first3 = L. | last4 = Guier | first4 = C. | title = Factors of patellar instability: an anatomic radiographic study. | journal = Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–26 | month =  | year = 1994 | doi =  | PMID = 7584171 }}</ref> Not having a groove because the trochlear bone has flattened out can cause the patella to slide because nothing is holding the patella in place.

==Treatment options==
[[File:Patella Luxation coronar3.png|thumb|X-ray and MRI after luxation of the patella. There is a fragment and bone bruise at the medial surface of the patella and in the corresponding surface of the lateral condyle of the femur. The medial retinaculum of the patella is disrupted.]]
Two types of treatment options are typically available:

* Surgery 
* Conservative treatment (rehabilitation)

Surgery may impede normal growth of structures in the knee, so doctors generally do not recommend knee operations for youth who are still growing.<ref name=shea2006/><ref name=nikku1997/>  There are also risks of complications, like an adverse reaction to anesthesia or an infection.<ref name=buchner2005/><ref name=shea2006/><ref name=nikku1997/>

When designing a rehabilitation program, clinicians consider associated injuries such as chipped bones or soft tissue tears. Clinicians will take into account the patient's age, activity level, and time needed to return to work and/or athletics. Doctors generally only recommend surgery when other structures in the knee have sustained severe damage, or specifically when there is:<ref name=shea2006/>

* Concurrent osteochondral injury
* Continued gross instability
* Palpable disruption of the medial patellofemoral ligament and the vastus medialis obliquus
* High-level athletic demands coupled with mechanical risk factors and an initial injury mechanism not related to contact

Supplements like [[glucosamine]] and [[NSAID]]s can be used to keep the knee strong.<ref name=bruknerKhan2006/>

==Post-treatment rehabilitation==
An effective rehabilitation program reduces the chances of reinjury or any other knee-related problems like patellofemoral pain syndrome or [[osteoarthritis]].  Rehabilitation focuses on maintaining strength and range of motion to reduce pain and maintain the health of the muscles and tissues around the knee joint.<ref name=bruknerKhan2006/>

===Prevention===
The [[patella]] is a floating sesamoid bone that is held in place by the quadriceps muscle tendon and patellar tendon ligament. Exercises should include strengthening [[quadriceps muscles]] such as [[rectus femoris]], [[vastus intermedius]], and [[vastus lateralis]]. However, tight and strong lateral quadriceps can be an underlying cause of a patella dislocation. If this is the underlying cause it is recommended to strengthen the medial quadriceps, vastus medialis (VMO), and stretch the lateral muscles.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Nomura | first1 = E. | last2 = Horiuchi | first2 = Y. | last3 = Kihara | first3 = M. | title = Medial patellofemoral ligament restraint in lateral patellar translation and reconstruction. | journal = Knee | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–127 | month = Apr | year = 2000 | doi =  | PMID = 10788776 }}</ref> Exercises to strengthen quadriceps muscles include but not limited to, [[Squat (exercise)|squats]], and [[lunges]]. Adding extra external support around the knee by using devices such as knee [orthotics] or athletic tape can help prevent patellar dislocation and other knee related injuries.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Gerrard | first1 = DF. | title = External knee support in rugby union.
