{{nihongo|'''Sahachirō Hata'''|秦 佐八郎|Hata Sahachirō|extra= March 23, 1873 – November 22, 1938}} was a [[Japan|Japanese]] [[bacteriologist]] who developed the [[Arsphenamine]] drug in 1909 in the laboratory of [[Paul Ehrlich]].

Hata was born in Tsumo Village, [[Mino District, Shimane]] (now part of [[Masuda, Shimane|Masuda City]]), and completed his medical education in [[Kyoto]]. He studied epidemic diseases under the famous Dr. [[Kitasato Shibasaburō]] at [[Kitasato University|Kitasato's Institute for the Study of Infectious Diseases]] in [[Tokyo]], and later studied [[immunology]] at the [[Robert Koch Institute]] in [[Berlin]]. While in [[Germany]], he took the opportunity to learn about [[chemotherapy]] at the German [[National Institute for Experimental Therapeutics]] in [[Frankfurt]], where he assisted [[Paul Ehrlich]] in the discovery of arsphenamine, which proved effective in curing [[syphilis]]. It was called [[Salvarsan 606]] because it was the 606th drug that Ehrlich tried.  

After his return to Japan, he helped found the Institute now [[Kitasato University]], of which he became a director. He also lectured at [[Keio University]].
