A '''psychiatric assessment''', or '''psychological screening''', is a process of gathering information about a person within a [[psychiatric]] (or mental health) service, with the purpose of making a [[diagnosis]]. The assessment is usually the first stage of a treatment process, but psychiatric assessments may also be used for various legal purposes. The assessment includes social and biographical information, direct observations, and data from specific psychological tests. It is typically carried out by a [[psychiatrist]], but it could be a multi-disciplinary process involving [[nurse]]s, [[psychologist]]s, [[occupational therapist]]s and [[social worker]]s.

==Purpose==

===Clinical assessment===
A psychiatric assessment is most commonly carried out for clinical and [[therapeutic]] purposes, to establish a diagnosis and [[clinical formulation|formulation]] of the individual's problems, and to plan the individual's care and treatment. This may be done in a hospital (or in-patient) setting, in an ambulatory (or out-patient) setting, or in a community setting (as a home-based assessment). Clinical assessment is the main focus of this article.

===Forensic assessment===
A [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatric]] assessment may have a number of purposes. A forensic assessment may be required of an individual who has been charged with a crime (usually a violent crime), to establish whether the person has the [[competence (law)|capacity]] (in legal terms) to stand trial. If a person with a mental illness is convicted of an offense, a forensic report may be required to inform the Court's sentencing decision, as a mental illness at the time of the offense may be a mitigating factor. A forensic assessment may also take the form of a risk assessment, to comment on the relationship between the person's mental illness and the risk of further violent offenses.

===Medico-legal assessment===
A medico-legal psychiatric assessment is required when a psychiatric report is used as evidence in civil [[litigation]], for example in relation to [[damages|compensation]] for work-related stress or after a traumatic event such as an accident. The psychiatric assessment may be requested in order to establish a link between the trauma and the victim's psychological condition, or to determine the extent of psychological harm and the amount of compensation to be awarded to the victim.<ref>{{cite book |title=Psychological trauma |last=Black |first=Dora |coauthors=Newman M,Harris-Hendriks J, Mezey G |year=1997 |publisher= Gaskell |location=London |isbn=0-902241-98-2 |pages=Part IV. Legal aspects: victims as witnesses and claimants}}</ref>

Medico-legal psychiatric assessments are also utilized in the context of child safety and [[child protection]] services. A child psychiatrist's assessment can provide information on the psychological impact of [[child abuse|abuse]] or neglect on a child. A child psychiatrist can carry out an assessment of [[parenting]] capacity, taking into consideration the mental state of both the child and the parents, and this may be used by child protective services to decide whether a child should be placed in an alternative care arrangement such as [[foster care]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Assessment of parenting. Psychiatric and psychological contributions. |last=Reder |first=Peter |coauthors=Lucey, C |year=2002 |publisher= Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-11454-3}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|Psychiatric history}}
A standard part of any psychiatric assessment is the obtaining of a body of social, demographic and biographical data known as the [[psychiatric history|history]]. The standard psychiatric history consists of biographical data (name, age, marital and family contact details, occupation, and first language), the presenting complaint (an account of the onset, nature and development of the individual's current difficulties) and personal history (including birth complications, childhood development, parental care in childhood, educational and employment history, relationship and marital history, and criminal background). The history also includes an enquiry about the individual's current social circumstances, family relationships, current and past use of alcohol and illicit drugs, and the individual's past treatment history (current and past diagnoses, and use of prescribed medication).<ref>Treatment Protocol Project (2004) p. 8–10</ref> 

The psychiatric history includes an exploration of the individual's culture and ethnicity, as cultural values can influence the way a person (and their family) communicates psychological distress and responds to a diagnosis of mental illness. Certain behaviors and beliefs may be misinterpreted as features of mental illness by a clinician who is from a different cultural background than the individual being assessed.<ref name="Bhugra1997">{{cite journal |last=Bhugra |first=Dinesh |coauthors=Bhui K |year=1997 |title=Cross-cultural psychiatric assessment |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=3 |pages=103–110 |doi=10.1192/apt.3.2.103 |issue=2}}</ref>

The assessment often includes gathering collateral information from other sources such as family members or (with children) teachers at school.

==Mental status examination==
{{main|Mental status examination}}
The mental status examination (or mental state examination in the UK and Australia) abbreviated MSE, is another core part of any psychiatric assessment. The MSE is a structured way of describing a [[patient]]'s current state of mind, under the domains of appearance, attitude, behavior, speech, mood and affect, thought process, thought content, perception, cognition (including for example orientation, memory and concentration), insight and judgement.<ref>{{cite book |author=Trzepacz, Paula T; Baker, Robert |title=The psychiatric mental status examination |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1993 |isbn=0-19-506251-5}}</ref> The purpose of the MSE is to obtain a comprehensive cross-sectional description of the patient's mental state. The data are collected through a combination of direct and indirect means: unstructured observation while obtaining the biographical and social information, focused questions about current [[symptom]]s, and formalized psychological tests. As with the psychiatric history, the MSE is prone to errors if cultural differences between the examiner and the patient are not taken into account, as different cultural backgrounds may be associated with different norms of interpersonal behavior and emotional expression.<ref name="Bhugra1997" /> The MSE is not to be confused with the [[mini-mental state examination]] (MMSE) which is a brief neuro-psychological screening test for dementia.

==Physical examination==
{{main|Physical examination}}
A thorough physical examination is regarded as an integral part of a comprehensive psychiatric assessment. This is because physical illnesses are more common in people with mental disorders, because neurological and other medical conditions may be associated with psychiatric symptoms, and to identify side effects of psychiatric medication. The physical examination would include measurement of [[body mass index]], [[vital signs]] such as pulse, blood pressure, temperature and respiratory rate, observation for [[pallor]] and [[nutritional deficiencies]], palpation for [[lymphadenopathy|lymph nodes]], palpation of the [[Abdominal examination|abdomen]] for organ enlargement, and examination of the [[cardiovascular system|cardiovascular]], [[respiratory examination|respiratory]] and [[neurological examination|neurological]] systems.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Garden |first=Gill |year=2005 |title=Physical examination in psychiatric practice |journal=Advances in Psychiatric treatment |volume=11 |pages=142–149 |url=http://apt.rcpsych.org/ |accessdate= 2008-07-04 |doi=10.1192/apt.11.2.142 |issue=2}}</ref>

==Physical investigations==
Although there are no physiological tests that confirm any mental illness, medical tests may be employed to exclude any co-occurring medical conditions that may present with psychiatric symptoms. These include blood tests measuring [[thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] to exclude [[hypothyroidism|hypo-]] or [[hyperthyroidism]], [[Blood tests#Blood chemistry tests|basic electrolytes]], serum [[calcium]] and [[liver enzymes]] to rule out a metabolic disturbance, and a [[Complete blood count|full blood count]] to rule out a systemic infection or chronic disease.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dale |first=Jenny |coauthors=Sorour, Eman; Milner, Gabrielle |year=2008 |title=Do psychiatrists perform appropriate physical investigations for their patients? A review of current practices in a general psychiatric inpatient and outpatient setting |journal=Journal of Mental Health |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=293–298 |doi=10.1080/09638230701498325}}</ref> The investigation of [[dementia]] could include measurement of serum [[vitamin B-12]] levels, [[serology]] to exclude [[syphilis]] or [[HIV]] infection, [[EEG]], and a [[CT scan]] or [[MRI]] scan.<ref>Treatment protocol project (2004) p. 592</ref> People receiving [[antipsychotic]] medication require measurement of [[plasma glucose]] and [[blood lipids|lipid levels]] to detect a medication-induced [[metabolic syndrome]], and an [[electrocardiogram]] to detect [[iatrogenic]] [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Marder |first=Stephen |coauthors=et al |year=2004 |title=Physical health monitoring of patients with schizophrenia |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=161 |pages=1334–49 |pmid=15285957 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.8.1334 |issue=8}}</ref>

==Assessment tools==
Clinical assessment can be supplemented by the use of symptom scales for specific disorders,<ref>Treatment protocol project (2004) p. 19</ref> for example the [[Beck Depression Inventory]] for depression or the [[Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale]] (BPRS)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psychiatrysource.com/Psychiatric-Assessment-Tools/?itemId=826537 |title= Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale |accessdate=2008-07-02 |work=Psychiatry Source |publisher=AstraZeneca}}</ref> or [[Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale]] (PANSS) for psychotic disorders. Scales such as HoNOS<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/crtu/healthofthenation.aspx |title=Health of the Nation Outcome Scales |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher= The Royal College of Psychiatrists |year=2008}}</ref> or the [[Global Assessment of Functioning]] are used to measure global level of functioning and to monitor response to treatment.

==Multidisciplinary assessment==
Psychiatric assessment in hospital settings is typically a multidisciplinary process, with contributions from [[psychiatric and mental health nursing|psychiatric nurses]], [[occupational therapists]], [[psychologists]] and [[social workers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.menningerclinic.com/p-psychiatricassessment/index.htm |title=Comprehensive Psychiatric Assessment Service |accessdate=2008-06-29 |publisher=Menninger |year=2008}}</ref> A psychiatrist takes a history and carries out a mental state examination and physical examination as described above. A nursing assessment includes risk assessment (risk of suicide, aggression, absconding from hospital, self-harm, sexual safety in hospital and medication compliance), physical health screening, and obtaining background personal and health information from the person being admitted and their carers. The immediate purpose of the nursing assessment is to determine the required level of care and supervision, and to have a plan to manage disturbed behavior.<ref>Treatment Protocol project (2003) p. 57-62</ref> Assessment could include a visit to the person's home, for direct observation of the social and living environment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/mentalhealth/articles/yellowlees/yellowlees.html |title=Psychiatric assessment in community practice |accessdate=2008-06-29 |last=Yellowlees |first=Peter |work=Mental Health Information Centre |publisher=eMJA}}</ref> The role of a psychologist includes the use of [[psychological testing|psychological tests]]: structured diagnostic instruments such as the [[Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory]] or psychometric tests such as the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC]] or [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS]], to assist with diagnosis and formulation of the person's problems. A psychologist might contribute to the team's assessment by providing a [[psychological formulation]] or [[applied behavior analysis|behavioral analysis]], which is an analysis, through systematic observation, of the factors which trigger or perpetuate the presenting problems.

==Other perspectives==
This article describes the assessment process within a [[medical model]], with the collection of supposedly [[objectivity (science)|objective]] data, identification of problems, formulation of a diagnosis leading to a specific treatment, but there are other approaches to the assessment of people with social and emotional difficulties. A [[family therapy]] or [[systemic therapy]] approach is not concerned with diagnoses but seeks to understand the problem in terms of relationships and communication patterns. The systemic tradition is suspicious of the objectivity of medical assessment, sees the individual's account as a subjective [[narrative therapy|narrative]], and sees diagnosis as a [[social construction|socially constructed]] phenomenon. From a [[solution focused brief therapy|solution focused]] perspective, the assessment deliberately avoids identification of problems, and seeks to elicit strengths and solutions.
