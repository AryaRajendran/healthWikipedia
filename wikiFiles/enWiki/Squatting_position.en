[[File:Michael Votter.jpg|thumb|Squatting on the ground as a resting position.]]'''Squatting''' is a posture where the weight of the body is on the [[Foot|feet]] (as with [[standing]]) but the [[knees]] are bent either fully (full or deep squat) or partially (partial, half, semi, parallel or monkey squat).  In contrast, [[sitting]], involves taking the weight of the body, at least in part, on the buttocks against the ground or a horizontal object such as a [[Chair|chair seat]]. [[wikt:crouch|Crouching]] may involve squatting or [[kneeling]]. It is possible to squat with one leg and assume another position (such as kneeling) with the other leg.<ref name=Hewes>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/666393 Hewes GW: ' World distribution of certain postural habits' American Anthropologist, 57, (1955), 231-44]</ref> Among Chinese adults, squatting often takes the place of sitting or standing.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/travel/17bpchina.html?ex=1176609600&en=1e3994b4f388c344&ei=5070 | work=The New York Times | title=An Eye on China's Not So Rich and Famous | first=Judith H. | last=Dobrzynski | date=2004-10-17 | accessdate=2010-04-07}}</ref>

== Young children ==
[[Image:Walter de Maria Vertikaler Erdkilometer.jpg|thumb|right|Young boy playing at ease in a squatting position]][[Toddler|Young children]] squat instinctively as a continuous movement from standing up whenever they want to lower themselves to ground level. One and two year olds can commonly be seen playing in a stable squatting position, with feet wide apart and bottom not quite touching the floor, although at first they need to hold onto something to stand up again.<ref>Slentz K, Krogh S Early Childhood Development and Its Variations (2001)</ref>

== Resting position ==
Full squatting involves resting one's weight on the feet with the buttocks resting on the backs of the calves. It may be used as a posture for resting or working at ground level particularly where the ground is too dirty or wet to [[sit]] or [[kneel]].<ref name=Hewes />

Most western adults cannot place their heels flat on the ground when squatting because of shortened [[Achilles tendon]]s largely caused  by habitually:<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2287673/Sitting-send-early-grave-Why-sofas-office-chair-carry-health-warning-.html Sitting down can send you to an early grave: Why sofas (and your office chair) should carry a health warning]</ref>
* sitting on chairs or seats
* wearing [[shoes]] with heels (especially [[High-heeled footwear|high heels]])

For this reason the squatting position is usually not sustainable for them for more than a few minutes as heels-up squatting is a less stable position than heels-down squatting.<ref>[[Marcel Mauss|Mauss, Marcel]]. [http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/mauss_marcel/socio_et_anthropo/6_Techniques_corps/Techniques_corps.html Les Techniques du corps] 1934. ''Journal de Psychologie'' 32 (3-4). Reprinted in Mauss, ''Sociologie et anthropologie'', 1936, Paris: PUF.</ref><ref>[http://www.healthline.com/blogs/exercise_fitness/2007/01/save-knees-when-squatting.html Save knees when squatting]</ref>

[[Catcher]]s in [[baseball]] and [[wicket-keeper]]s in [[cricket]] assume full squatting positions.

== Childbirth position ==
{{Main|Childbirth positions}}
Engelmann's seminal work "Labor among primitive peoples" publicised the [[childbirth]] positions amongst primitive cultures to the Western world. They frequently use squatting, [[standing]], [[kneeling]] and [[all-fours]] positions, often in a sequence.<ref>Engelmann GJ Labor among primitive peoples (1883)</ref>

Various people have promoted the adoption of these alternative birthing positions, particularly squatting, for Western countries, such as [[Grantly Dick-Read]], [[Janet Balaskas]], [[Moysés Paciornik]] and [[Hugo Sabatino]]. The adoption of these alternative positions is also promoted by the [[natural childbirth]] movement.

The squatting position gives a greater increase of pressure in the pelvic cavity with minimal muscular effort. The birth canal will open 20 to 30% more in a squat than in any other position. It is recommended for the [[Childbirth#Second_stage:_expulsion|second stage of childbirth]].<ref name=Russell>Russell JG. Moulding of the pelvic outlet. J Obstet Gynaecol Br Commonw 1969;76:817-20.</ref>

As most Western adults find it difficult to squat with heels down, compromises are often made such as putting a support under the elevated heels or another person supporting the squatter.<ref>[http://activebirth.org/Pages2/PAGES2PDFs/bbd13art6.pdf Balaskas J Using the squatting position during labour and for birth]</ref>

== Sexual position ==
{{Main|Woman on top (sex position)}}
In the woman on top sexual position (also known as cowgirl), the woman commonly assumes a squatting position over the man, sometimes referred to as a frog squat.

== Female urination position ==

When not [[urination|urinating]] into a [[toilet]], squatting is the one way for a female to direct the urine stream (although many women find that they can do so standing up). If done this way, the urine will go forward downwards. Some females use one or both hands to focus the direction of the urine stream, which is more easily achieved while in the squatting position.

Acceptability of outdoor urination in a public place other than at a public urinal varies with the situation and with customs.  In [[Western countries]], males typically do this standing up, while females [[Sitting#Parallel_legs|squat]].

== Defecation position ==
{{Main|Squatting defecation posture}}
[[Image:Pedestal-squat-toilet.jpg|thumbnail|right|Some toilets allow the user to defecate in either the squatting or the sitting position]]

The squatting [[defecation]] posture involves squatting by standing with knees and hips sharply bent and the buttocks suspended near the ground.  [[Squat toilet]]s are designed to facilitate this posture.  It is more widespread in the [[developing world]] than in the [[Western world]].

== Dynamic exercise ==
{{Main|Squat (exercise)}}
[[Image:Squat.png|right|thumb|200px|Weightlifting moving from a full squat to standing position.]]In [[strength training]], the squat is a full body exercise that trains primarily the [[muscle]]s of the [[thigh]]s, [[hip]]s and [[gluteal muscles|buttocks]], as well as strengthening the [[bone]]s, [[ligament]]s and insertion of the [[tendon]]s throughout the lower body.  Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and [[Muscle hypertrophy|size]] of the legs and buttocks.

==Yoga==
{{Main|Garland Pose}}
Malasana, also known as ''Yoga Squat'' or the [[Garland Pose]], is an [[asana]].

The asana is a squat with heels flat on the floor and hip-width apart (or slightly wider if necessary), toes pointing out on a diagonal.  The torso is brought forward between the thighs, elbows are braced against the inside of the knees, and the hands press together in front of the chest in [[Añjali Mudrā]].<ref name=yj1>{{Cite web|title=Garland Pose|publisher=Yoga Journal|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2472|accessdate=2009-06-12}}</ref>

== Partial squat ==
A partial squat is an intermediate stage between standing and full squatting, that is, standing but with the knees bent. (In contrast, [[stooping]] involves bending at the waist rather than just the hips and knees). This may be used in a variety of contexts often as a "ready for action" posture:
* the batsman's posture in [[cricket]] when waiting for a delivery.
* waiting to receive a serve in [[tennis]]
* used in the [[Alexander technique]], as "the monkey squat" also known as the "position of mechanical advantage"<ref>[http://www.easyvigour.net.nz/fitness/h_monkey.htm The Monkey Squat (Position of Mechanical Advantage)]</ref>
* ready for action in [[sumo wrestling]].
* to avoid back strain it is important to bend the knees whenever you lift a heavy object.<ref>[http://www.back.com/articles-lifting.html Lifting technique]</ref>
*  [[Glossary of ballet#Plié|plié]] in [[ballet]] is a type of partial squat balanced on the toes only and the legs turned outwards. (The [[Glossary of ballet#Grand plié|grand plié]] has the thighs parallel to the ground like a parallel squat or demi-plie where the thighs are at about a 45% angle to the ground).
*  the parallel squat, often used in weight training, is just short of a full squat where the thighs are parallel to the ground.
*  [[Monkey Kung Fu]] a [[Chinese martial art]] which utilizes [[ape]] or [[monkey]]-like movements as part of its technique.
*  a [[Besti squat]] is a [[figure skating]] move.

===Lunge ===
A lunge is a variation of the partial squat where a leg is moved forwards with the knee bent but the other remains straight thus moving the upper body forward in line with the bent knee. For example:
* the snooker playing posture
* the [[Lunge (fencing)|fencing lunge]]
* the [[Lunge (exercise)|lunge]] as a [[weight training]] or [[strength training]] exercise.

== Walking ==
Stalking or prowling is essentially walking while in or close to a full squat. This is designed to be a walk that maintains a low profile.

== Health effects ==
{{Medref|date=April 2013}}
In the 1970s, [[Denis Parsons Burkitt]] advocated the idea that the use of the natural squatting position, in particular for defecation, protects the natives of Africa and Asia from various illnesses<ref name=Burkitt>Burkitt DP Varicose Veins, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Haemorrhoids: Epidemiology and Suggested Aetiology  British Medical Journal, 1972;2:556-561</ref>

There is increased incidence of knee osteoarthritis amongst squatters who squat for hours a day for many years.<ref>Liu CM, Xu L Retrospective study of squatting with prevalence of knee osteoarthritis  -  2007</ref> There is evidence that sustained squatting may cause bilateral [[peroneal nerve]] [[:wikt:palsy|palsy]]. A common name for this affliction is squatter's palsy although there may be reasons other than squatting for this to occur.<ref>Macpherson JM, Gordon AJ Squatter's palsy British Medical Journal, 1983</ref><ref>Kumaki DJ.

=== Tetralogy of Fallot ===
{{Main|Tetralogy of Fallot}}
Older children will often squat during a Tetralogy of Fallot "tet spell". This increases [[systemic vascular resistance]] and allows for a temporary reversal of the [[Cardiac shunt|shunt]]. It increases  pressure on the left side of the heart, decreasing the [[Right-to-left shunt|right to left shunt]] thus decreasing the amount of deoxygenated blood entering the systemic circulation.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Murakami T |title=Squatting: the hemodynamic change is induced by enhanced aortic wave reflection |journal=Am.

== Squatting facets ==
The existence of squatting facets on the [[distal]] [[tibia]] and [[talus bone|talar]] articular
surfaces of skeletons, which result from contact between the two bones during [[Dorsiflexion|hyperdorsiflexion]], have been used as markers to indicate if that person habitually squatted.<ref>Barnett CH Squatting facets on the European talus J Anat. 1954 October; 88(Pt 4): 509–513.</ref><ref>[[Erik Trinkaus|Trinkaus E]] Squatting among the neandertals: A problem in the behavioral interpretation of skeletal morphology Journal of Archaeological Science Volume 2, Issue 4, December 1975, Pages 327-351</ref>
