'''Syncytiotrophoblast''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] 'syn'- "together"; 'cytio'- "of cells"; 'tropho'- "nutrition"; 'blast'- "bud") is the [[Epithelium|epithelial]] covering of the highly vascular [[embryo]]nic [[placenta]]l [[Chorionic villi|villi]], which invades the wall of the [[uterus]] to establish nutrient circulation between the embryo and the mother. It is a unique tissue in that it is a multi-nucleated, terminally differentiated [[syncytium]], extending to 13m². It lacks proliferative capacity and instead is maintained by fusion of underlying [[cytotrophoblast]] cells.

It is the outer syncytial layer of the [[trophoblast]]s and actively invades the [[uterus|uterine wall]], rupturing maternal [[capillaries]] and thus establishing an interface between maternal blood and embryonic [[extracellular fluid]], facilitating passive exchange of material between the mother and the embryo.

The syncytiotrophoblast secretes [[progesterone]] in addition to [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) and [[Human placental lactogen| human placental lactogen (HPL)]]; hCG prevents degeneration of the [[corpus luteum]]. Progesterone serves to maintain the integrity of the [[Endometrium|uterine lining]] and, until the syncytiotrophoblast is mature enough to secrete enough progesterone to support pregnancy (in the fourth month of embryonic development), it is aided by the corpus luteum graviditatis.<ref>Langman's Medical Embryology, 10th Edition.
