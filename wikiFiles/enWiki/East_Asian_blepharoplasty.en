'''Asian blepharoplasty''', also known as "double eyelid surgery", is a type of [[cosmetic surgery]] where the skin around the [[human eye|eye]] is reshaped ([[blepharoplasty]]). The purpose of the procedure is to create an upper [[eyelid]] with a crease (i.e. "double eyelid") from an eyelid that is naturally without a crease (a.k.a. "single eyelid").<ref name="pmid8532781">{{cite journal |author=Chen WP |title=Concept of triangular, trapezoidal, and rectangular debulking of eyelid tissues: application in Asian blepharoplasty |journal=Plast.

Anatomically, there are a number of subtle differences in the upper eyelids of many [[Asia]]ns particularly from [[East Asia|East]], [[North Asia|North]] and [[Central Asia|Central]] Asia, as well as many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], compared with the differences in the eyelids of other races.<ref name="pmid10408455">{{cite journal |author=Jeong S, Lemke BN, Dortzbach RK, Park YG, Kang HK |title=The East Asian upper eyelid: an anatomical study with comparison to the Caucasian eyelids |journal=Arch. Ophthalmol. |volume=117 |issue=7 |pages=907–12 |year=1999 |pmid=10408455 |doi=}}</ref> While there are some Asians with a double eyelid and some without, there is also a large variation in the crease position (double eyelid size) of the East Asian upper eyelid. The upper lid fold can range from 1&nbsp;mm above the eyelash line to about 10&nbsp;mm.  Several methods can be used to create the double eyelid — including the full-incisional, partial incision and no incision methods (e.g. the DST method). Each has its advantages depending on the patient's anatomy and desires.

Asian blepharoplasties have been reported to be the most common aesthetic procedure in [[Taiwan]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Liao WC, Tung TC, Tsai TR, Wang CY, Lin CH |title=Celebrity arcade suture blepharoplasty for double eyelid |journal=Aesthetic Plast Surg |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=540–5 |year=2005 |pmid=16237581 |doi=10.1007/s00266-005-0012-5}}</ref> [[South Korea]] <ref>http://leeds.academia.edu/RuthHolliday/Papers/744838/Gender_Globilization_and_Cosmetic_Surgey_in_South_Korea</ref> and other parts of [[East Asia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kim JW, Lee JO |title=Asian blepharoplasty with a short-pulsed contact Nd-Yag laser: limited-incision resectable laser double fold with internal medial and lateral functional epicanthoplasty |journal=Aesthetic Plast Surg |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=433–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9852177 |doi=10.1007/s002669900230}}</ref> The procedure has been reported to have some risk of complications, but is generally quite safe if done by an expert plastic surgeon.<ref name="pmid15457048">{{cite journal |author=Chen SH, Mardini S, Chen HC, ''et al.'' |title=Strategies for a successful corrective Asian blepharoplasty after previously failed revisions |journal=Plast.

The procedure to alter the natural Asian "single eyelid" appearance has been a subject of controversy, and described by opponents of the procedure, such as author [[David Mura]], as being ''"indoctrinated by white standards of beauty"''<ref>http://www.fashionwindows.com/fashion_review/2000/eyelid_surgery.asp</ref>
