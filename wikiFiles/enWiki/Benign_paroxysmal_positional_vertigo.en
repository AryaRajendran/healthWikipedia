'''Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo''' ('''BPPV''') is a disorder arising in the [[inner ear]]. Its symptoms are repeated episodes of positional [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], that is, of a spinning sensation caused by changes in the position of the head.<ref name=Bhattacharyya>{{cite journal |author= Bhattacharyya N |title= Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo |journal= Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg |volume=139 |issue=5 Suppl 4 |pages=S47–81 |year=2008 |pmid=18973840 |doi=10.1016/j.otohns.2008.08.022 |url=http://www.entnet.org/Practice/upload/BPPV-guideline-final-journal.pdf |format=PDF |laysummary=http://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-11/aaoo-edr102808.php |laysource=AAO-HNS |laydate=2008-11-01 |author-separator= , |author2= Baugh RF |author3= Orvidas L |display-authors= 3 |last4= Barrs |first4= D |last5= Bronston |first5= L |last6= Cass |first6= S |last7= Chalian |first7= A |last8= Desmond |first8= A |last9= Earll |first9= J}}</ref>  BPPV is the most common cause of the symptoms of vertigo.<ref name="PubMed Health">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002393/{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref>

==Classification==
[[Vertigo (medical)|Vertigo]], a distinct process sometimes confused with [[dizziness]], accounts for about 6 million clinic visits in the U.S. every year, and 17–42% of these patients eventually are diagnosed with BPPV.<ref name="Bhattacharyya" /> Other causes of vertigo include:
* [[Motion sickness]]/Motion Intolerance: a disjunction between visual stimulation, vestibular stimulation, and/or [[proprioception]]
* Visual exposure to nearby moving objects (examples of [[Optokinetic reflex|optokinetic]] stimuli: passing cars, falling snow)
* Other diseases: ([[labyrinthitis]], [[Ménière's disease]], [[migraine]].<ref>Buchholz, D. Heal Your Headache. New York:Workman Publishing;2002:74-75</ref> etc.)

==Signs and symptoms==
*Symptoms
**Vertigo: Spinning dizziness, which must have a rotational component.
**Short duration (paroxysmal):  Lasts only seconds to minutes
**Positional in onset:  Can only be induced by a change in position.
**[[Nausea]] is often associated
**Visual disturbance: It may be difficult to read or see during an attack due to associated [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]].
**Pre-syncope (feeling faint) or syncope (fainting) is unusual.
**Emesis (vomiting) is uncommon but possible.

*Signs
**Rotatory (torsional) nystagmus, where the top of the eye rotates towards the affected ear in a beating or twitching fashion, which has a latency and can be fatigued (the vertigo should lessen with deliberate repetition of the provoking maneuver).
**Nystagmus should only last for 30 seconds to one minute.

Patients do not experience other neurological deficits such as [[numbness]] or [[weakness]], and if these symptoms are present, a more serious etiology such as posterior circulation [[stroke]] or ischemia, must be considered.

The spinning sensation experienced from BPPV is usually triggered by movement of the head, will have a sudden onset, and can last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. The most common movements patients report triggering a spinning sensation are tilting their head upwards in order to look at something, and rolling over in bed.<ref name="PubMed Health" />

==Cause==

Within the [[labyrinth (inner ear)|labyrinth]] of the inner [[ear]] lie collections of calcium crystals known as [[otolith|otoconia or otoliths]]. In patients with BPPV, the otoconia are dislodged from their usual position within the [[Utricle (ear)|utricle]] and migrate over time into one of the [[semicircular canals]] (the [[posterior canal]] is most commonly affected due to its anatomical position). When the head is reoriented relative to gravity, the gravity-dependent movement of the heavier otoconial debris (colloquially "'''ear rocks'''") within the affected semicircular canal causes abnormal (pathological) fluid [[endolymph]] displacement and a resultant sensation of [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]]. This more common condition is known as '''canalithiasis'''.

In rare cases, the crystals themselves can adhere to a semicircular canal [[cupula]] rendering it heavier than the surrounding endolymph. Upon reorientation of the head relative to gravity, the cupula is weighted down by the dense particles thereby inducing an immediate and maintained excitation of semicircular canal [[afferent nerve]]s. This condition is termed '''cupulolithiasis'''.

There is evidence in the dental literature that malleting of an [[osteotome]] during closed [[sinus lift|sinus floor elevation]], otherwise known as ''osteotome sinus elevation'' or ''lift'', transmits enough percussive and vibratory forces capable of detaching otoliths from their normal location and leading to the symptoms of BPPV.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=21054553 |year=2011 |last1=Sammartino |first1=G |last2=Mariniello |first2=M |last3=Scaravilli |first3=MS |title=Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo following closed sinus floor elevation procedure: Mallet osteotomes vs. Screwable osteotomes. A triple blind randomized controlled trial |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=669–72 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0501.2010.01998.x |journal=Clinical oral implants research}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=20498765 |year=2010 |last1=Kim |first1=MS |last2=Lee |first2=JK |last3=Chang |first3=BS |last4=Um |first4=HS |title=Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo as a complication of sinus floor elevation |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=86–9 |doi=10.5051/jpis.2010.40.2.86 |pmc=2872812 |journal=Journal of periodontal & implant science}}</ref>

It can be triggered by any action which stimulates the posterior semi-circular canal which may be:
* Tilting the head
* Rolling over in bed
* Looking up or under
* Sudden head motion
* Post head injury

BPPV may be made worse by any number of modifiers which may vary between individuals:
* Changes in barometric pressure - patients often feel symptoms approximately two days before rain or snow
* Lack of sleep (required amount of sleep may vary widely)
* Stress

BPPV is one of the most common vestibular disorders in patients presenting with dizziness and migraine is implicated in idiopathic cases. Proposed mechanisms linking the two are genetic factors and vascular damage to the labyrinth.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00415-009-0149-2 |title=Epidemiology of vertigo, migraine and vestibular migraine |year=2009 |last1=Lempert |first1=T. |last2=Neuhauser |first2=H. |journal=Journal of Neurology |volume=256 |issue=3 |pages=333–8 |pmid=19225823}}</ref>

Although BPPV can occur at any age, it is most often seen in people over the age of 60.<ref name="MayoClinic">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vertigo/DS00534/DSECTION=risk-factors{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref>  Besides aging, there are no major risk factors known for developing BPPV, although previous episodes of trauma to the head or inner ear infections known as [[labyrinthitis]], may predispose individuals to future development of BPPV.<ref name="PubMed Health" />

==Diagnosis==
The condition is diagnosed by the patient's history, and by performing the [[Dix-Hallpike]] maneuver and/or the roll test.<ref name=Schubert>Schubert, M. C. (2007). Vestibular Disorders. In S. O’Sullivan & T. Schmitz (Eds.), ''Physical Rehabilitation'' (5th ed.) (pp. 999-1029). Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company.{{page needed|date=June 2012}}</ref> Patients with BPPV will report a history of vertigo as a result of fast head movements. Many patients are also capable of describing the exact head movements that provokes their vertigo.<ref name=Korres>{{cite journal |pmid=15467614 |year=2004 |last1=Korres |first1=SG |last2=Balatsouras |first2=DG |title=Diagnostic, pathophysiologic, and therapeutic aspects of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo |volume=131 |issue=4 |pages=438–44 |doi=10.1016/j.otohns.2004.02.046 |journal=Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery}}</ref> 

The Dix-Hallpike test is a common test performed by examiners to determine whether the [[posterior semicircular canal]] is involved.<ref name=Korres/> It involves a reorientation of the head to align the posterior semicircular canal (at its entrance to the [[Osseous ampullae|ampulla]]) with the direction of gravity. This test will reproduce vertigo and nystagmus characteristic of posterior canal BPPV.<ref name=Schubert/>

When performing the [[Dix-Hallpike]] test, patients are descended quickly to a [[supine position]] with the neck extended by the clinician performing the maneuver. For some patients, this maneuver may not be indicated and a modification may be needed that also targets the [[posterior semicircular canal]]. Such patients include those who are too anxious about eliciting the uncomfortable symptoms of vertigo and those who may not have the range of motion necessary to comfortably be in a supine position. Obesity can also present a challenge when performing this assessment. The  modification involves the patient moving from a seated position to side-lying without their head extending off the examination table, such as with Dix-Hallpike. The head is rotated 45 degrees away from the side being tested and the eyes are examined for [[nystagmus]]. A positive test is indicated by patient report of a reproduction of vertigo and nystagmus. Both the Dix-Hallpike and the side-lying testing position have yielded similar results and as such the side-lying position can be used if the Dix-Hallpike cannot be performed easily.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15021771 |year=2004 |last1=Cohen |first1=HS |title=Side-lying as an alternative to the Dix-Hallpike test of the posterior canal |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=130–4 |journal=Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology}}</ref>

The roll test can determine whether the [[horizontal semicircular canal]] is involved.<ref name=Schubert/> The roll test requires the patient to be in a supine position with his/her head in 20° of cervical flexion. Then the examiner quickly rotates the head 90° to the left side, and checks for vertigo and [[nystagmus]]. This is followed by gently bringing the head back to the starting position. The examiner then quickly rotates the head 90° to the right side, and checks for vertigo and nystagmus.<ref name=Schubert/> In this roll test, the patient may experience vertigo and nystagmus on both sides, but rotating towards the affected side will trigger a more intense vertigo. Similarly, when the head is rotated towards the affected side, the nystagmus will beat towards the ground and be more intense.<ref name=Korres/> 

As mentioned above, both the Dix-Hallpike and roll test provoke the signs and symptoms in subjects suffering from archetypal BPPV. The signs and symptoms patients with BPPV experience are typically a short-lived vertigo, and observed nystagmus.  In some patients, though rarely, the vertigo can persist for years. Assessment of BPPV is best done by a [[health professional]] skilled in management of dizziness disorders, commonly a [[physiotherapist]], [[audiologist]] or other medical [[physician]].

The nystagmus associated with BPPV has several important characteristics which differentiate it from other types of nystagmus.

* Positional:  the nystagmus occurs only in certain positions
* Latency of onset: there is a 5-10 second delay prior to onset of nystagmus
* Nystagmus lasts for 5–120 seconds
* Visual fixation suppresses nystagmus due to BPPV
* Rotatory/Torsional component is present or (in the case of lateral canal involvement) the nystagmus beats in either a geotropic (towards the ground) or ageotropic (away from the ground) fashion
* Repeated stimulation, including via Dix-Hallpike maneuvers, cause the nystagmus to fatigue or disappear temporarily.

Although rare, CNS disorders can sometimes present as BPPV.  A practitioner should be aware that if a patient whose symptoms are consistent with BPPV, but does not show improvement or resolution after undergoing different particle repositioning maneuvers, which are detailed in the Treatment section below, need to have a detailed neurological assessment and  imaging performed to help identify the pathological condition.<ref name="Pmid">{{cite journal |pmid=18973840 |year=2008 |last1=Bhattacharyya |first1=N |last2=Baugh |first2=RF |last3=Orvidas |first3=L |last4=Barrs |first4=D |last5=Bronston |first5=LJ |last6=Cass |first6=S |last7=Chalian |first7=AA |last8=Desmond |first8=AL |last9=Earll |first9=JM |title=Clinical practice guideline: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo |volume=139 |issue=5 Suppl 4 |pages=S47–81 |doi=10.1016/j.otohns.2008.08.022 |journal=Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Two treatments have been found effective for relieving symptoms of posterior canal BPPV: the canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) or [[Epley maneuver]],<ref name="pmid22513962">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008675.pub2 |chapter=Modifications of the Epley (canalith repositioning) maneuver for posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) |title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2012 |last1=Hunt |first1=William T |last2=Zimmermann |first2=Eleanor F |last3=Hilton |first3=Malcolm P |editor1-last=Hilton |editor1-first=Malcolm P}}</ref> and the liberatory or Semont maneuver.<ref name="Bhattacharyya"/> The CRP employs [[gravity]] to move the [[calcium]] build-up that causes the condition.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2005.085894 |title=Short-term efficacy of Epley's maneuver: A double-blind randomised trial |year=2006 |last1=Von Brevern |first1=M |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry |volume=77 |issue=8 |pages=980}}</ref> The particle repositioning maneuver can be performed during a clinic visit by health professionals or taught to patients to practice at home. In the Semont maneuver, patients themselves are able to achieve canalith repositioning.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000130250.62842.C9 |title=Self-treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: Semont maneuver vs Epley procedure |year=2004 |last1=Radtke |first1=A. |last2=Von Brevern |first2=M. |last3=Tiel-Wilck |first3=K. |last4=Mainz-Perchalla |first4=A. |last5=Neuhauser |first5=H. |last6=Lempert |first6=T. |journal=Neurology |volume=63 |pages=150–2 |pmid=15249626 |issue=1}}</ref> Both treatments, when performed by a health professional, appear to be equally effective. When practiced at home, the CRP is more effective than the Semont maneuver. The most effective repositioning treatment for posterior canal BPPV is the therapist-performed CRP combined with home practiced CRP.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2522/ptj.20090071 |title=Effectiveness of Particle Repositioning Maneuvers in the Treatment of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo: A Systematic Review |year=2010 |last1=Helminski |first1=J.

The [[Epley maneuver]] (particle repositioning) does not address the actual presence of the particles (otoconia), rather it changes their location.  The maneuver aims to move these particles from some locations in the inner ear which cause symptoms such as vertigo, and reposition them to where they do not cause these problems.

The Brandt-Daroff exercises may be prescribed by the clinician as a home treatment method usually in conjunction with particle repositioning maneuvers or in lieu of the particle repositioning maneuver. The exercise is a form of habituation exercise, designed to allow the patient to become accustomed to the position which causes the [[vertigo]] symptoms. The Brandt-Daroff exercises are performed in a similar fashion to the Semont maneuver; however, as the patient rolls onto the unaffected side, the head is rotated toward the affected side.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8606637 |year=1996 |last1=Vesely |first1=DL |last2=Chiou |first2=S |last3=Douglass |first3=MA |last4=McCormick |first4=MT |last5=Rodriguez-Paz |first5=G |last6=Schocken |first6=DD |title=Atrial natriuretic peptides negatively and positively modulate circulating endothelin in humans |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=315–9 |journal=Metabolism: clinical and experimental |doi=10.1016/S0026-0495(96)90284-X}}</ref> The exercise is typically performed 3 times a day with 5-10 repetitions each time, until symptoms of vertigo have resolved for at least 2 days.<ref name=Schubert /> 

For the Lateral (Horizontal) canal, a separate maneuver has been used for productive results. It is unusual for the lateral canal to respond to the canalith repositioning procedure used for the posterior canal [[BPPV]]. Treatment is therefore geared towards moving the canalith from the lateral canal into the vestibule.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3410/M2-60 |author1=<Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.>}}</ref> The roll maneuver or its variations are used and involves rolling the patient 360 degrees in a series of steps to reposition the particles.<ref name="Pmid" /><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.otohns.2008.08.022 |title=Clinical practice guideline: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo |year=2008 |last1=Bhattacharyya |first1=N |last2=Baugh |first2=R |last3=Orvidas |first3=L |last4=Barrs |first4=D |last5=Bronston |first5=L |last6=Cass |first6=S |last7=Chalian |first7=A |last8=Desmond |first8=A |last9=Earll |first9=J |journal=Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery |volume=139 |issue=5 |pages=S47–81 |pmid=18973840}}</ref>  This maneuver is generally performed by a trained [[clinician]] who begins seated at the head of the examination table with the patient supine<ref name=Hornibrook>{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/2011/835671 |title=Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV): History, Pathophysiology, Office Treatment and Future Directions |year=2011 |last1=Hornibrook |first1=Jeremy |journal=International Journal of Otolaryngology |volume=2011 |pages=1}}</ref> There are four stages, each a minute apart and at the third position the horizontal canal is oriented in a vertical position with the patient's neck flexed and on forearm and elbows.<ref name=Hornibrook /> When all four stages are completed, the head roll test is repeated and if negative treatment ceases.<ref name=Hornibrook />

Medical treatment with anti-vertigo medications may be considered in acute, severe exacerbation of BPPV, but in most cases are not indicated. These primarily include drugs of the anti-histamine and anti-cholinergic class, such as  [[meclizine]] and [[scopolamine]] respectively. The medical management of vestibular syndromes has become increasingly popular over the last decade, and numerous novel drug therapies (including existing drugs with new indications), have emerged for the treatment of vertigo/dizziness syndromes. These drugs vary considerably in their mechanisms of action, with many of them being receptor or ion channel-specific. Among them, include [[betahistine]] or [[dexamethasone]]/[[gentamicin]] for the treatment of [[Ménière's disease]],  [[carbamazepine]]/[[oxcarbazepine]] for the treatment of paroxysmal [[dysarthria]] and [[ataxia]] in [[multiple sclerosis]], [[metoprolol]]/[[topiramate]] or [[valproic acid]]/tricyclic antidepressant for the treatment of vestibular migraine, and [[4-aminopyridine]] for the treatment of episodic ataxia type 2 and downbeat and upbeat nystagmus.<ref name=meds>{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/00016489.2010.531052 |title=Which medication do I need to manage dizzy patients? |year=2011 |last1=Huppert |first1=Doreen |last2=Strupp |first2=Michael |last3=Mückter |first3=Harald |last4=Brandt |first4=Thomas |journal=Acta Oto-laryngologica |volume=131 |issue=3 |pages=228–41 |pmid=21142898}}</ref> These drug therapies offer symptomatic treatment, and do not affect the disease process or resolution rate.  Medications may be used to suppress symptoms during the positioning maneuvers if the patient's symptoms are severe and intolerable. More dose-specific studies are required however, in order to determine the most effective drug(s) for both acute symptom relief and long term remission of the condition. For a complete list of these novel therapies and their associated target symptoms, follow the link below to the Informahealthcare website.<ref name=meds />

Surgical treatments, such as a semi-circular canal occlusion, do exist for BPPV but carry the same risk as any neurosurgical procedure.  Surgery is reserved as a last resort option for severe and persistent cases which fail vestibular rehabilitation (including particle repositioning and habituation therapy).

Devices such as a head over heels "rotational chair" are available at some tertiary care centers<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9865636 |year=1998 |last1=Furman |first1=JM |last2=Cass |first2=SP |last3=Briggs |first3=BC |title=Treatment of benign positional vertigo using heels-over-head rotation |volume=107 |issue=12 |pages=1046–53 |journal=The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology}}</ref>  Home devices, like the [[DizzyFIX]], are also available for the treatment of BPPV and vertigo.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/MLG.0b013e31814b290d |title=Evaluation of a Particle Repositioning Maneuver Web-Based Teaching Module |year=2008 |last1=Beyea |first1=Jason Atkins |last2=Wong |first2=Eric |last3=Bromwich |first3=Matthew |last4=Weston |first4=W Wayne |last5=Fung |first5=Kevin |journal=The Laryngoscope |volume=118 |pages=175–80 |pmid=18251035 |issue=1}}</ref>

The [[Semont maneuver]] has a cure rate of 90.3%.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Short-term efficacy of semont maneuver for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: a double-blind randomized trial | author=Chen Y, Zhuang J, Zhang L, Li Y, Jin Z, Zhao Z, Zhao Y, Zhou H | date=2012 Sep | journal=Otol Neurotol | volume=33(7) | pages=1127–30}}</ref> It is performed as follows:
#The patient is seated on a treatment table with their legs hanging off the side of the table. The therapist then turns the patient’s head towards the unaffected side 45 degrees.
#The therapist then quickly tilts the patient so they are lying on the affected side. The head position is maintained, so their head is turned up 45 degrees. This position is maintained for 3 minutes. The purpose is to allow the debris to move to the apex of the ear canal.
#The patient is then quickly moved so they are lying on the unaffected side with their head in the same position (now facing downwards 45 degrees). This position is also held for 3 minutes. The purpose of this position is to allow the debris to move toward the exit of the ear canal.
#Finally, the patient is slowly brought back to an upright seated position. The debris should then fall into the utricle of the canal and their symptoms of vertigo should decrease or end completely. Some patients will only need one treatment, but others may need multiple treatments depending on the severity of their BPPV.
