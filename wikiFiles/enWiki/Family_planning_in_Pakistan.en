Even though there is considerable demand for [[family planning]] in [[Pakistan]], adoption has been hampered by government neglect, lack of services and misconceptions.  [[Demographics]] play a large role in [[Pakistan]]'s development and security since the recent change from military rule to civilian leadership.<ref name=hardee>Hardee, Karen and Leahy, Elizabeth. "Population, Fertility and Family Planning in Pakistan: A Program in Stagnation." Population Action International. Volume 4, Number 1, 1-12. 2007.</ref> Challenges to Pakistani's well-being, opportunities for [[education]] and employment, and access to [[health care]] are escalated due to the country's continuously-growing population.<ref name=hardee/> It was estimated in 2005 that Pakistan's population totaled 151 million; a number which grows 1.9 percent annually, equaling a 2.9 million population growth per year.<ref name=debating>"Pakistan: Debating Islam and family planning." IRIN. UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. 06 Apr 2011. http://irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=28617</ref> Though Pakistan's fertility rates still exceed those of neighboring South Asian countries with a total fertility rate at 4.1 (3.3 children in urban settings and 4.5 children in rural areas) and [[contraception]] use is lower than 35 percent, approximately one-fourth of Pakistani women wish to either delay the birth of their next child or end childbearing altogether.<ref name=hardee/>

According to Dr. Ansar Ali Khan, an advisor of [[reproductive health]] to the [[United Nations Population Fund]] in Pakistan, "A combination of factors like non-availability of services, baseless traditional beliefs and misconception play a big role."<ref name=debating/> In addition, Ali Khan stated that "a fairly large number of the population believes the use of artificial contraceptives for [[family planning]] is against nature and also against [[Islam]]."<ref name=debating/> Unlike [[Family Planning in Iran]], a neighboring Islamic republic, Pakistan's [[family planning]] program has failed in recent years due to neglect and constant policy changes as a result of political upheaval.<ref name=boonstra>Boonstra, Healther. "Islam, Women and Family Planning: A Primer." The Guttmacher Report on Public Policy. Volume 4, Number 6, 4-7. December 2001.</ref> While 96 percent of married women were reported to know about at least one method of contraception, only half of them had ever used it.<ref name=hardee/>

==History==
In 1950, Pakistan's population reached 37 million people, making it the world's 13th most populous country.<ref name=hardee/> Though Pakistan was one of the first Asian countries to begin a family planning program with some help from international donors, fertility has declined slower than in neighboring countries. In 2007, Pakistan had increased in world population ranking to 6th, with over 164 million people and the [[United Nations]] (UN) has projected that in 2050 it will move into 5th place with around 292 million people.<ref name=hardee/>

===Beginnings===
The Family Planning Association of Pakistan (FPAP), now called "Rahnuma", was founded in Lahore by Saeeda Waheed in 1953.<ref>http://www.fpapak.org/</ref> Waheed, a member of the All-Pakistan Women's Association, began advocating for [[birth control]] when her maid died from an attempt to abort her own pregnancy.<ref name=khan>Khan, Ayesha. "Policy-making in Pakistan's population programme." Health and Policy Planning. Volume 11, Number 1, 30-51. Oxford, 1996.</ref> The FPAP was unsuccessful in changing family planning policies until President and military leader [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] took interest in the problem of overpopulation in the late 1950s.<ref name=khan/> Khan spoke at the FPAP's first national seminar in 1959, speaking on the ‘menace over overpopulation'.<ref name=khan/> Soon after the seminar, the National Board of Family Planning was established as a policy-advising body for the federal government.<ref name=khan/>  

Pakistani journalist/researcher Ayesha Khan has suggested various reasons for Ayub Khan's position on population control.<ref name=khan/> Firstly, religion played a minor role in his government, a position that would change with Pakistan's next leader. Secondly, development ideology during Khan's time of power warned of the economic risks of high population growth rates. Thirdly, it had political utility for a military leader with no popular mandate to his leadership and in need of a development strategy. Lastly, support from international donors.<ref name=khan/>

===Family planning policy in the 1960s===
Pakistan's first Family Planning Scheme was a part of the country's Third Five Year Plan (1965–1970).<ref name=khan/> This scheme became the template for all subsequent family planning strategies. The scheme's goal was to have a vast impact in the shortest time possible, with a reduction of the birth rate from 50 to 40 per 1000 by 1970.<ref name=khan/> At the onset of the program, [[condoms]] were the most available method of contraception, but by 1966 the [[Intrauterine Device]] (IUD) had replaced it has the "corner-stone" of the Scheme. It was said to be "safe, cheap, reversible," and it required "little user action."<ref name=khan/>

===Family planning amid political turmoil===
In 1969, Ayub Khan was overthrown by the joint action of right-wing religious parties and the left-wing [[Pakistan People's Party]].<ref name=khan/> His successor [[Yahya Khan]] did little more than watch as a civil war ripped apart East and West Pakistan in 1971. [[Wajihuddin]] Ahmed, the Family Planning Commissioner during Yahya Khan's rule, focused on reducing pregnancies in women "rather than meeting contraceptive targets alone" and introducing the pill to Pakistani women.<ref name=khan/>

In 1971, while the country was split apart and international assistance halted due to army atrocities in Bangladesh, the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] took power of the Pakistani government.<ref name=khan/> Its leader, [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]], needed to gain legitimacy and popularity by taking an anti-American, anti-capitalist, and anti-Ayub Khan-stance. However, Bhutto found that he could not fund many of his socialist promises, and so allowed economic assistance from [[USAID]].  Over the 15 year span of 1964-1979, USAID "spent over $30 million on Pakistan's population programme; during 1965-75 US AID provided 40% of total programme inputs."<ref name=khan/> However, due to extreme and unrealistic goals,{{vague|date=September 2011}} the USAID program was highly ineffective.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

In 1977 Bhutto's Chief of Army Staff, General [[Zia ul-Haq]], deposed the leader and declared martial law.<ref name=khan/> Zia differed from his predecessors in that he "made the religious-right-wing his political ideology." He had used the religious lobbies and conservative middle-classes as support for his take-over. In a move looking to counter Bhutto's government and as a gesture to his religious constituency, Zia froze the existing family planning program and banned publicity for family planning activities. Zia enforced strict laws against adultery (punishable by death), [[rape]], intoxication, and theft. USAID funding was suspended, and Pakistan became alienated "from the Western powers that Ayub Khan had so carefully cultivated."<ref name=khan/>

Near the end of Zia's era of power, family planning and population control became tied to the [[Ministry of Health (Pakistan)]]. Unfortunately, the program has remained fairly unchanged over the past 35 years due to implementation problems involving over-centralization, lack of coordination, and structural flaws.<ref name=khan/>

==Religious influences==
{{see also|Religious views on birth control}}
[[Muslim]] populations are incredibly diverse, varying by race, language, and degree of religious conservatism.<ref name=rf>Roudi-Fahimi, Farzeaneh. "Islam and Family Planning." Population Reference Bureau. 2004.</ref> Some populations are part of countries run by Islamic law, while others live under secular governments.<ref name=rf/> In Pakistan, extremely conservative Islamic beliefs predominate in many parts of the country, in which [[purdah]] restricts women to their homes unless chaperoned by a male relative.<ref name=boonstra/> Additionally, levels of schooling are very low in Pakistan, allowing men to have more power in decision-making.<ref name=boonstra/>

When Ayub Khan was overthrown in 1969, religious demonstrators attempted to discredit the leader morally using the slogan "Family planning, for those who want free sex!"<ref name=khan/> This ideology is still present in Pakistan, as the organized religious party opposes family planning because it is "un-Islamic".<ref name=boonstra/> Though Pakistani couples commonly site religious regions for avoiding birth control, there is not one definitive agreement about family planning and contraception in Islam.<ref name=boonstra/> In Pakistan, many local religious figures are supportive of family planning and have begun discussions in their communities in order to promote the health of women and children.<ref name=boonstra/>

==Current contraceptive use==
Historical political strife and cultural restrictions on women constraining their empowerment have hampered implementation of family planning strategies throughout the country.<ref name=hardee/> Most women who say they do not want any more children or would like to wait a period of time before their next pregnancy do not have the contraceptive resources available to them in order to do so.<ref name=hardee/> One-fourth of married women are estimated to have an unmet need.<ref name=hardee/> In the 1990s, women increasingly reported to wanting fewer children, and 24 percent of recent births were reported to be unwanted or mistimed.<ref name=hardee/><ref name=boonstra/> The rate of [[unwanted pregnancies]] is higher for women living in poor or rural environments; this is especially important since two-thirds of women live in rural areas.<ref name=hardee/> While only 22 percent of pregnant married women report to be currently using a modern method of birth control and 8 percent reported to be using a traditional method, lack of widespread contraceptive use could be due to the lack breadth of the current family planning program.<ref name=hardee/><ref name=boonstra/> The most commonly reported reasons for married women electing not to use family planning methods include the belief that fertility should be determined by God (28 percent); opposition to use by the woman, her husband, others or a perceived religious prohibition (23 percent); infertility (15 percent); and concerns about health, side effects or the cost of family planning (12 percent).<ref name=hardee/>

Extending beyond the reach of family planning and contraceptive methods is the issue of women's sexual and reproductive health. According to the [[World Health Organization]]  and [[Population Action International]], as of 2007, "only 16 percent of women receive at least four antenatal care visits during pregnancy, fewer than one-third of births are attended by skilled health personnel, and the maternal mortality ratio, at 320 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, remains high."<ref name=hardee/>

==Current policy==
Dating from 2002, Pakistan's current family planning policy reflects the government's concern with rising population trends and poverty. The policy's goals include reducing population growth (from 2.1 percent in 2002 to 1.3 by 2020), reducing fertility through voluntary family planning (from 4 births per woman in 2004 to 2.1 births per woman by 2020), and as a signatory to the Programme of Action developed at the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] in Cairo in 1994, Pakistan pledged to provide universal access to family planning by 2010.<ref name=hardee/> Also in Pakistan's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper is the objective of increasing contraceptive use 57 percent by 2012.<ref name=hardee/>

===Family planning in 2000s===
In 2006-7, the Pakistan Demographic Health Survey of Pakistan (PDHS 2006-7)showed that approximately 30% of married women of reproductive age (MWRA) were using some form of Family Planning. Of these 8% used a traditional and 22% used a modern method. Approximately 25% had an unmet for Family Planning, of this around 2/3rd was for limiting and the rest for spacing. These translate into 7 million FP users, 5 million users of modern methods and 6 million with an unmet need. Since a large number of modern method users are sterilized and received the service in a previous year, the actual number women availing any FP service were just under 3 million or less than half of those with an unmet need.<ref>http://resdev.org/Docs/01fpoverview.pdf Overview of Family Planning in Pakistan</ref> The DHS also dispelled the popular notion that religious reasons keep families from using family planning. In the DHS less than 10% of FP non users cited a religious reason for their non use. 

Using data from the PDHS 2006-7, approximately 35% of FP users received their FP services from the public sector, 12% from NGOs and private providers and the overwhelming 52% bought their methods over the counter from shops, making FP services largely subject to market forces. The government spends on average around Rs. 4 billion (USD 42 million) a year on FP but nearly 90% of this goes towards salaries and overheads and commodities account for 7-14% of these funds.<ref>http://resdev.org/Docs/04fpcosts.pdf Utilization and Costs of Family Planning in Pakistan</ref><ref>http://www.pbs.gov.pk/content/national-health-accounts-pakistan-2005-06 National Health Accounts of Pakistan 2005-6</ref> Since the PDHS 2006-7, operations of NGOs have increased but it appears that according to the supply data there has been no increase in supply of FP commodities and that entry of the NGO Marie Stopes Society into FP services has displaced clients from other private sector, perhaps those that previously self procured commodities..
