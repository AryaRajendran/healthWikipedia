The '''Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation''' (OMRF), located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is an independent, nonprofit biomedical [[research institute]]. Established in 1946, OMRF is dedicated to understanding and developing more effective treatments for human disease. Stephen M. Prescott, M.D.,<ref name="Prescott1">{{cite web

OMRF’s scientists, who include a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and a [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] investigator, hold more than 500 U.S. and international patents and have spun off 11 biotech companies. Discoveries at OMRF led to [[Xigris]], the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of severe sepsis, and Ceprotin, a therapy for people suffering from a rare and life-threatening blood disorder known as protein C deficiency. Research at OMRF also identified the enzyme believed responsible for Alzheimer’s disease and laid the groundwork for OncoVue,<ref name="Oncovue">{{cite web

==History==
OMRF was chartered in 1946. The next year, Oklahoma Gov. [[Roy J. Turner]] launched a fund drive for OMRF that spanned all 77 of Oklahoma’s counties. By May 1949, 7,000 Oklahomans had donated and pledged $2.35 million, and construction of OMRF began.

In the summer of 1949, [[Sir Alexander Fleming]] made his first visit to the United States to dedicate OMRF’s yet-to-be-completed building. An estimated 2,500 people attended the ceremonies on July 4 of that year, where Fleming pronounced the future “bright” for what was then, in the Nobel laureate’s words, “just a big hole in the ground.”

OMRF opened its doors on Dec. 17, 1950. Since that time, OMRF has grown from 5 principal scientists to 50, and its staff has grown from roughly two dozen employees to more than 500. Securing more than $30 million annually in competitive research grants from the [[National Institutes of Health]] and other granting agencies, OMRF is a member of the Association of Independent Research Institutes.<ref name="AIRI1">{{cite web

In 2007, Tang uncovered a molecular mechanism that links an Alzheimer’s susceptibility gene (known as E4) to the process of disease onset.
