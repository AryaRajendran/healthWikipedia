Treatments under investigation may improve function, curtail attacks, or limit the progression of the underlying disease. Many treatments already in clinical trials involve drugs that are used in other diseases or medications that have not been designed specifically for MS. There are also trials involving the combination of drugs that are already in use for multiple sclerosis. Finally, there are also many basic investigations that try to understand better the disease and in the future may help to find new treatments.

==Disease-modifying drugs and procedures in trial phase II and III==
Disease-modifying drugs and procedures represent possible interventions able to modify the natural course of the disease instead of targeting the symptoms or the recovery from relapses. Over a dozen clinical trials testing potential therapies are underway, and additional new treatments are being devised and tested in animal models.

===Phase III===

[[Clinical trial#Phase III|Phase III]] programs consist of [[Clinical trial|studies]] on large patient groups (300 to 3,000 or more) and are aimed at being the definitive assessment of how effective and safe a test drug will be. It is the last stage of [[drug development]] and is followed by a submission to the appropriate regulatory agencies (e.g., [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMEA) for the [[European Union]], the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for the [[USA]], [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] (TGA) for [[Australia]], etc.) to obtain approval for marketing. Treatment in MS phase III studies is usually 2 years per patient.

*'''[[Alemtuzumab]]''' (injectable. brand names: ''Campath'' and ''Lemtrada''; under development by [[Genzyme]] and [[Bayer Schering Pharma AG|Bayer Schering]]) is a monoclonal antibody currently already used in the treatment of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] and [[T-cell lymphoma]]. Results from the phase II study comparing it to ''Rebif'' ([[interferon beta-1a]]) were published in May 2007 showing efficacy. However, the trial was halted after 3 cases of [[immune thrombocytopenic purpura]] (ITP) were reported; later on, a further 3 more cases were found, and 1 patient died. This is a life-threatening side effect but is treatable if detected. Therefore, all patients receiving alemtuzumab should have their [[platelet]] count monitored.<ref>[http://www.genzyme.com/corp/media/GENZ%20PR-050207.asp Information from GenZyme on its clinical trial for Alemtuzumab ]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Coles AJ, Compston DA, Selmaj KW, ''et al.'' |title=Alemtuzumab vs. interferon beta-1a in early multiple sclerosis |journal=N Engl J Med. |volume=359 |issue=17 |pages=1786–801 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18946064 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0802670 }}</ref> Two phase 3 trials comparing with Rebif are due to end in 2011.<ref>[http://www.clinicaltrial.gov/ct2/show/NCT00530348?term=alemtuzumab&rank=38 clinicaltrial.gov Phase III Alemtuzumab Study 1;vs Rebif.] Enrollment: 81, Start Sept 2007, Est' end date May 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.clinicaltrial.gov/ct2/show/NCT00548405?term=alemtuzumab&rank=31 clinicaltrial.gov Phase III Alemtuzumab Study 2;vs Rebif] Enrollment: 840, Start Date: Oct 2007, Est End Date: Sept 2011.</ref> The results have been considered a success<ref>Sanofi Reports Positive Top-Line Results From First Phase 3 Study Of Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada™) In Multiple Sclerosis, [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/230825.php] L</ref> and the drug has been submitted for approval on June 2012<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/246536.php Lemtrada submitted for approval on June 2012]</ref> under the name [[Lemtrada]].

===Phase II===

[[Clinical trial#Phase II|Phase II]] studies are performed on mid-sized groups of patients (20 to 300) and are designed to assess whether a drug may work in the targeted disease area, as well as to continue earlier safety assessments obtained in healthy volunteers. Treatment in MS phase II studies is with 4–12 months usually shorter than in phase III studies.

Worldwide 275 patients will participate in this phase II trial the outcome of which is to establish what the optimal dosage of BAF312 is for patients affected with Multiple Sclerosis for use in further trials.

* [[GIFT15]] is a treatment which suppresses the [[immune system]], and has been successfully used in the treatment of mice.  The immune system attacks the [[central nervous system]] in Multiple Sclerosis patients.  Specifically a "granulocyte-macrophage colony–stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and [[interleukin-15]] (IL-15) 'fusokine]' (GIFT15) exerts immune suppression via aberrant signaling through the IL-15 receptor on lymphomyeloid cells.

*'''[[Low dose naltrexone]]''' is also known as LDN. Naltrexone, a pure opiate antagonist, licensed by the FDA for the treatment of alcohol and opioid addictions, is currently being studied at a lower dosage for MS patients.

==Combined therapies==

Several combinations of drugs have been tested. Some of them are couples of approved drugs. Other tests try one approved drug with one experimental substance. Finally, at some point there could appear some trials testing couples of non-approved drugs.

===Combination of approved drugs===

* '''Mitoxantrone & Copaxone:''' A recent study in the United Kingdom revealed interesting results when using a combination of [[mitoxantrone]] and [[copaxone]]. In an open-label study of 27 patients with RRMS, the results suggested a rapid and sustained suppression of relapses. A three year controlled study of 60 patients is now being launched at 10 centres across the UK.<ref>[http://www.mxga-mstrial.co.uk United Kingdom early Mitoxantrone Copaxone trial]</ref> In another clinical trial, [[glatiramer acetate]] (Copaxone) has been combined with Mitoxantrone in such a way that every course of Mitoxantrone is followed by GA treatment.

==Investigation for aggressive variants==
Progressive variants have proved more difficult to treat than RRMS. This is the status of the research into progressive variants.

===Highly Active Relapsing Remitting===

Highly Active Relapsing Remitting, sometimes called Rapidly Worsening relapsing remitting, is a clinical form considered distinct from standard RR during clinical trials, being normally non responsive to standard medication.

As of 2011, [[fingolimod]] has been approved as the first disease modifying therapy for this clinical course.<ref>First Oral Treatment For Highly Active Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Provides New Choice For UK Patients Failing On Injections, [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/222803.php]</ref> [[Cyclophosphamide]] is currently used off-label for Rapidly Worsening MS (RWMS).<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11990872 | volume=8 | issue=2 | title=Treatment of multiple sclerosis with cyclophosphamide: critical review of clinical and immunologic effects | year=2002 | month=April | author=Weiner HL, Cohen JA | journal=Mult. Scler. | pages=142–54}}</ref>

===Primary progressive===

This variant does not have any approved treatment currently. Some possible treatments have been published, such as [[methylprednisolone]] pulses<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1590/S0004-282X2008000300013 |author=de Araújo EA, de Freitas MR |title=Benefit with methylprednisolone in continuous pulsetherapy in progressive primary form of multiple sclerosis: study of 11 cases in 11 years |journal=Arq Neuropsiquiatr |volume=66 |issue=2B |pages=350–3 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18641870 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0004-282X2008000300013&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en}}</ref> or [[riluzole]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Killestein J, Kalkers NF, Polman CH |title=Glutamate inhibition in MS: the neuroprotective properties of riluzole |journal=J Neurol Sci. |volume=233 |issue=1–2 |pages=113–5 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15949499 |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2005.03.011 }}</ref> and some reduction of spasticity was reported in a pilot Italian study on [[low dose naltrexone]]<ref name="pmid18728058" /> but there is nothing conclusive still.

A [[Statin]], Simvastatin (Zocor), has shown good results in progressive variants<ref name="Statin may slow progressive MS"/>

===Secondary progressive and progressive-relapsing===

Only Mitoxantrone has been approved, but most of the previous pipeline drugs have been or will be tried on it at some point.

*'''[[Cyclophosphamide]]''' (trade name [[Revimmune]]) is currently in Phase III for secondary progressive MS.<ref>Significant Advances in Multiple Sclerosis Treatment http://www.pharmacytimes.com/publications/specialty-pt/2011/February-2011/SPT-NPP-0211</ref> It was also studied for RRMS but the company does not pursue actively this path.
