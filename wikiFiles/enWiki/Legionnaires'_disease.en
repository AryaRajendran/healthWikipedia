'''Legionnaires disease''', is a potentially fatal pneumonia caused by ''[[Legionella pneumophila]]'', a [[Gram negative|gram negative]], [[Aerobic bacteria|aerobic bacteria]] that is carried by [[Amoeboid|amoeba]] that thrive in stagnant water.<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10528878 |title=Free-living amoebae protecting Legionella...

==Epidemiology==
Legionella pneumophila was first identified in 1976. National surveillance systems and research studies were established early, and in recent years improved ascertainment and changes in clinical methods of diagnosis have contributed to an upsurge in reported cases in many countries. Environmental studies continue to identify novel sources of infection, leading to regular revisions of guidelines and regulations. There are about 8,000 to 18,000 cases of Legionnaires' disease each year in the United States, according to the Bureau of Communicable Disease Control.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/http://cmr.asm.org/content/15/3/506 |title=Legionellosis. |date=Nov. 2011 |work=Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Bureau of Communicable Disease Control.|accessdate=2012-11-12}}</ref>  

Between 1995 and 2005 over 32,000 cases of Legionnaires' disease and more than 600 outbreaks were reported to the [[European Working Group for Legionella Infections]] There is a shortage of data on ''Legionella'' in developing countries and it is likely that ''Legionella''-related illness is underdiagnosed worldwide.<ref>World Health Organization 2007. ''Legionella'' and the prevention of legionellosis. Geneva, Switzerland: WHO. Available at http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/emerging/legionella.pdf</ref> Improvements in diagnosis and surveillance in developing countries would be expected to reveal far higher levels of morbidity and mortality than are currently recognised. Similarly, improved diagnosis of human illness related to ''legionella'' species and serogroups other than ''Legionella pneumophila'' would improve knowledge about their incidence and spread.

A 2011 study successfully used modeling to predict the likely number of cases during Legionnairesâ€™ outbreaks based on symptom on-set dates from past outbreaks. In this way, the eventual likely size of an outbreak can be predicted, enabling efficient and effective use of public health resources in managing an outbreak.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21242803</ref>

==History==
{{See also|1976 Philadelphia Legionnaires' disease outbreak}}
The first recognized cases of Legionnaires' disease occurred in 1976 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] among attendees of a Legionnaires' convention held at the [[The Bellevue-Stratford Hotel|Bellevue-Stratford Hotel]]. Of the 2000 Legionnaires who attended the convention, 221 became ill and 34 of those died.

==Reservoirs==
''[[Legionella pneumophila]]'' thrives in aquatic systems where it is established within [[Amoeboid|amoeba]] in a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]]. In the built environment, [[central air conditioning]] systems in office buildings, hotels, and hospitals are sources of contaminated water.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cti.org/cgi-bin/download.pl |title=Legionellosis Guideline: Best Practices for Control of '&#39;Legionella'&#39; (WTP-148) (06) |publisher=Cooling Technology Institute |accessdate=2010-09-11}}.</ref>  [[Cooling towers]] used in industrial cooling systems as well as [[evaporative cooler]]s, [[nebulizer]]s, [[humidifiers]], [[Jacuzzi|whirlpool spas]], [[water heating|hot water systems]], showers, windshield washers, fountains, room-air humidifiers, ice making machines, and [[Evaporative cooler|misting]] systems typically found in grocery store produce sections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/165/4/736.abstract |title=Communitywide Outbreak of Legionnaires' Disease Associated with a Grocery Store Mist Machine |publisher=Jid.oxfordjournals.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news195847365.html |title=Legionnaires' disease link to lack of windscreen wash |publisher=Physorg.com |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref>
