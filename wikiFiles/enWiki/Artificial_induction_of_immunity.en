'''Artificial induction of immunity''' is the artificial induction of immunity to specific diseases – making people immune to disease by means other than waiting for them to catch the disease.  The purpose is to reduce the risk of death and suffering.<ref name=unicef />

[[Immunity (medical)|Immunity]] against infections that can cause serious illness is generally beneficial. Since [[Pasteur]] provided support for a [[germ theory]] of infectious disease, we have increasingly '''induced immunity''' against a widening range of diseases to prevent the associated risks from the wild infections.<ref name=unicef >{{cite web|title=Immunization|url=http://www.unicef.org/immunization/|publisher=UNICEF}}</ref> It is hoped that further understanding of the molecular basis of immunity will translate to improved clinical practice in the future.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0304-4017(94)03123-E |title=Molecular basis for vaccine development against anaplasmosis and babesiosis |year=1995 |last1=Palmer |first1=Guy H. |last2=McElwain |first2=Terry F. |journal=Veterinary Parasitology |volume=57 |pages=233–53 |pmid=7597787 |issue=1–3}}</ref>

== Variolation and smallpox ==
{{Main|variolation|smallpox}}
[[File:Inoculation.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Typical site of inoculation in Europe and the British colonies]]
The earliest recorded artificial induction of immunity in humans was by [[variolation]] or [[inoculation]], which is the controlled infection of a subject with a less lethal natural form of smallpox (known as Variola Minor) to make him or her immune to re-infection with the more lethal natural form, Variola Major. This was practiced in ancient times in China and India, and imported into Europe, via Turkey, around 1720 by [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu|Lady Montagu]] and perhaps others.  From England, the technique spread rapidly to the Colonies, and was also spread by African slaves arriving into Boston.<ref name=NIH-Variolation>{{cite web |publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]] |work=Smallpox – A Great and Terrible Scourge |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/smallpox/sp_variolation.html |title=Variolation}}</ref><ref name=White>{{cite book |first=Andrew Dickson |last=White |title=A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology |chapter=Theological Opposition to Inoculation, Vaccination and the use of Anaesthetics |location=New York |publisher=D. Appleton and Company |year=1898 |chapterurl=http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/whitem10.html}}</ref>

Variolation had the disadvantage that the inoculating agent used was still an active form of smallpox and, although less potent, could still kill the inoculee or spread in its full form to others nearby. However, as the risk of death from inoculation with Variola Minor was just 1% to 2%, as compared to the 20% risk of death from the natural form of smallpox, the risks of inoculation were generally considered acceptable.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1258/jrsm.2008.08k008 |title=Zabdiel Boylston's evaluation of inoculation against smallpox |year=2008 |last1=Boylston |first1=A. |last2=Williams |first2=A. |journal=JRSM |volume=101 |issue=9 |pages=476}}</ref><ref>Lettres Philosophiques.

== Vaccination ==
{{Main|vaccination|Edward Jenner}}

In 1796, [[Edward Jenner]], a doctor and scientist who had practiced variolation, performed an experiment based on the folk-knowledge that infection with [[cowpox]], a disease with minor symptoms which was never fatal, also conferred immunity to smallpox.<ref name=WWS-harris>Harris F "Edward Jenner and Vaccination" World Wide School [http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/tech/medicine/EdwardJennerAndVaccination/chap1.html Full text]</ref> Jenner induced cowpox infection by transferring material from a lesion on one patient to another, thus infecting the second patient with cowpox. He then demonstrated that the latter was immune by exposing him to smallpox. The principle had been demonstrated some years earlier by [[Benjamin Jesty]], who had not publicized his discovery. Jenner described and generalised the process and then arranged to propagate cowpox for therapeutic use and he is credited with the discovery.<ref name=Voltaire-XI>François Marie Arouet de Voltaire (1694–1778). Lettres Philosophiques "Letter XI—On Inoculation" ''The Harvard Classics''. 1909–14. [http://www.bartleby.com/34/2/11.html English translation]</ref>  Vaccination took over from variolation.

Jenner, like all members of the [[Royal Society]] in those days, was an [[empiricism|empiricist]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.revmed.2006.09.024 |title=Histoire de la vaccination: De l'empirisme aux vaccins recombinants |trans_title=History of vaccination: from empiricism towards recombinant vaccines |language=French |year=2007 |last1=Guérin |first1=N. |journal=La Revue de Médecine Interne |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=3–8 |pmid=17092612}}</ref><ref>Vaccines-- a Biography  edited by Andrew W.

== Germ theory ==
{{Main|Louis Pasteur|germ theory}}

In the second half of the 1800s [[Louis Pasteur]] perfected experiments which disproved the then-popular theory of [[spontaneous generation]] and from which he derived the modern [[germ theory]] of (infectious) disease. Using experiments based on this theory, which posited that specific microorganisms cause specific diseases, Pasteur isolated the infectious agent from [[anthrax]]. He then derived a vaccine by altering the infectious agent so as to make it harmless and then introducing this inactivated form of the infectious agents into farm animals, which then proved to be immune to the disease.<ref>Principles of microbiology
 By Alice Lorraine Smith 1985: p636 http://books.google.com/books?id=5NRpAAAAMAAJ&dq=pasteur+anthrax  ISBN 0-8016-4685-5{{pn|date=April 2013}}</ref>

Pasteur also isolated a crude preparation of the infectious agent for [[rabies]]. In a brave piece of rapid medicine development, he probably saved the life of a person who had been bitten by a clearly rabid dog by performing the same inactivating process upon his rabies preparation and then inoculating the patient with it. The patient, who was expected to die, lived, and thus was the first person successfully vaccinated against rabies.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Anthrax is now known to be caused by a [[bacteria|bacterium]], and rabies is known to be caused by a [[virus]]. The [[microscopes]] of the time could reasonably be expected to show bacteria, but imaging of viruses had to wait until the development of [[electron microscopes]] with their greater [[Angular_resolution#Microscope_case|resolving power]] in the 20th century.

== Toxoids ==
{{See also|Botulism}}
Some diseases, such as [[tetanus]], cause disease not by bacterial growth but by bacterial production of a [[toxin]]. Tetanus toxin is so lethal that humans cannot develop immunity to a natural infection, as the amount of toxin and time required to kill a person is much less than is required by the immune system to recognize the toxin and produce [[antibody|antibodies]] against it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pathogenic Clostridia, including Botulism and Tetanus (page 3)|url=http://textbookofbacteriology.net/clostridia_3.html|publisher=Todar's Online Textbook of Bacteriology}}</ref> However the tetanus toxin is easily [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]]d losing its ability to produce disease, but leaving it able to induce immunity to tetanus when injected into subjects. The denatured toxin is called a [[toxoid]].<ref name=roitt >{{cite isbn|063200276X|noedit}}{{pn|date=April 2013}}</ref>

== Adjuvants ==
{{main|Adjuvant}}

The use of simple molecules such as toxoids for immunization tends to produce a low response by the immune system, and thus poor [[Memory B cell|immune memory]]. However, adding certain substances to the mixture, for example adsorbing tetanus toxoid onto [[alum]], greatly enhances the immune response (see Roitt etc. below). These substances are known as adjuvants. Several different adjuvants have been used in vaccine preparation. Adjuvants are also used in other ways in researching the immune system.<ref>http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/antibody/overview.htm{{full|date=April 2013}}</ref>

A more contemporary approach for "boosting" the immune response to simpler immunogenic molecules (known as [[antigen]]s) is to '''conjugate''' the antigens. [[Conjugation]] is the attachment to the antigen of another substance which also generates an immune response, thus amplifying the overall response and causing a more robust immune memory to the antigen. For example, a toxoid might be attached to a [[polysaccharide]] from the [[Bacterial capsule|capsule]] of the bacteria responsible for most [[lobar pneumonia]].<ref>http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/p/pneumovax_23/pneumovax_pi.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite report|last1=Nuorti|first1=J.P.|last2=Whitney|first2=C.G.|date=December 10, 2010|title=Prevention of Pneumococcal Disease Among Infants and Children --- Use of 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine and 23-Valent Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5911a1.htm?s_cid=rr5911a1_e|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref>

== Temporarily induced immunity ==
{{See also|immunoglobulin}}
[[File:Platypus.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Platypus: [[monotremes]] lack placental transfer of immunity]]
Temporary immunity to a specific infection can be induced in a subject by providing the subject with externally produced immune molecules, known as [[antibody|antibodies]] or [[immunoglobulin]]s. This was first performed (and is still sometimes performed) by taking blood from a subject who is already immune, isolating the fraction of the blood which contains antibodies (known as the [[blood plasma|serum]]), and injecting this serum into the person for whom immunity is desired. This is known as [[passive immunity]], and the serum that is isolated from one subject and injected into another is sometimes called [[antiserum]]. Antiserum from other mammals, notably horses, has been used in humans with generally good and often life-saving results, but there is some risk of [[anaphylactic shock]] and even death from this procedure because the human body sometimes recognizes antibodies from other animals as foreign proteins.<ref name=roitt />
Passive immunity is temporary, because the antibodies which are transferred have a lifespan of only about 3–6 months.<ref name=roitt /> Every placental mammal (including humans) has experienced temporarily induced immunity by transfer of [[homology (biology)|homologous]] antibodies from its mother across the [[placenta]], giving it passive immunity to whatever its mother became immune to.<ref name=roitt /><ref>EHRLICH, P. (1892) Ueber Immunitaet durch Vererbung und Saeugung. Z. Hyg. Infect. Kr. 12, 183.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=7438556 |year=1980 |last1=Pitcher-Wilmott |first1=RW |last2=Hindocha |first2=P |last3=Wood |first3=CB |title=The placental transfer of IgG subclasses in human pregnancy |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=303–8 |pmc=1537014 |journal=Clinical and experimental immunology}}</ref>  This allows some protection for the young while its own immune system is developing.

Synthetic ([[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] or cell-clone) human immunoglobulins can now be made, and for several reasons (including the risk of [[prion]] contamination of biological materials) are likely to be used more and more often. However, they are expensive to produce and are not in large-scale production as of 2013.<ref>http://www.antibodyengineering.co.uk/?gclid=CN2ZxfLFz7YCFWbKtAod-TAADQ  Engineers of small-scale humanised antibody production.  Prices on application.</ref> In the future it might be possible to artificially design antibodies to fit specific antigens, then produce them in large quantities to induce temporary immunity in people in advance of exposure to a specific [[pathogen]], such as a bacterium, a virus, or a [[prion]]. At present, the science to understand this process is available but not the technology to perform it.<ref>Immunisation article in Ganfyd, the online collaborative textbook of medicine.  http://www.ganfyd.org/index.php?title=Artificial_induction_of_immunity</ref>
