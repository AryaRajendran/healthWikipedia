'''Erythrocyte complement receptor 1''' ('''CR1''', also known as '''[[cluster of differentiation|CD35]]''', '''C3b/C4b receptor''' and '''[[immune adherence]] receptor''') is a human [[gene]].<ref name = "entrez_ 1378">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: CR1 complement component (3b/4b) receptor 1 (Knops blood group)| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=1378| accessdate = }}</ref><ref name="pmid1708809">{{cite journal | author = Moulds JM, Nickells MW, Moulds JJ, Brown MC, Atkinson JP | title = The C3b/C4b receptor is recognized by the Knops, McCoy, Swain-langley, and York blood group antisera | journal = J.

This [[protein]] encoded by this gene is a member of the regulators of complement activation (RCA) family and is located in the 'cluster RCA' region of chromosome 1. The gene encodes a monomeric single-pass type I membrane glycoprotein found on erythrocytes, leukocytes, glomerular podocytes, and splenic follicular dendritic cells. The Knops blood group system is a system of antigens located on this protein. The protein mediates cellular binding to particles and immune complexes that have activated complement. Decreases in expression of this protein and/or mutations in its gene have been associated with gallbladder carcinomas, mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and sarcoidosis. Mutations in this gene have also been associated with a reduction in ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' rosetting, conferring protection against severe malaria. Alternate allele-specific splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized. Additional allele specific isoforms, including a secreted form, have been described but have not been fully characterized.<ref name = "entrez_ 1378"/>

In primates,  CR1 serves as the main system for processing and clearance of complement [[opsonized]] [[immune complexes]]. It has been shown that CR1 can act as a negative regulator of the [[Complement system|complement]] cascade, mediate [[immune adherence]] and [[phagocytosis]] and inhibit both the classic and alternative pathways. The number of CR1 molecules decreases with aging of [[erythrocyte]]s in normal individuals and is also decreased in pathological conditions such as [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE), [[HIV]] infection, some {{SWL|target=haemolytic anaemia|type=decrease_associated_with_disease}}s and other conditions featuring [[immune complex]]es.  In mice, CR1 is an alternatively spliced variant of the complement receptor 2 (CR2) gene.

Certain [[alleles]] of this gene have been statistically associated with an increased risk of developing late-onset [[Alzheimer's Disease]].<ref name="pmid19734903">{{cite journal | author = Lambert JC, Heath S, Even G, ''et al.'' | title = Genome-wide association study identifies variants at CLU and CR1 associated with Alzheimer's disease | journal = Nat.

==1q32 region==
In humans, the ''CR1'' gene is located at on the long arm of chromosome 1 at band 32 (1q32) and lies within a complex of immunoregulatory genes. In 5’-3’ order the genes in this region are: membrane cofactor protein - CR1- complement receptor type 2 - decay-accelerating factor - C4-binding protein. 

* [[Membrane cofactor protein]] is a widely distributed C3b/C4b binding regulatory [[glycoprotein]] of the complement system; 
* [[decay-accelerating factor]] (DAF: CD55: Cromer antigen) protects host cells from complement-mediated damage by regulating the activation of C3 convertases on host cell surfaces; 
* [[complement receptor 2]] is the C3d receptor. 

[[Factor H]], another immunoregulatory protein, also maps to this location. 

==Forms==
The most common form of the CR1 gene (CR1*1) is composed of 38 [[exon]]s spanning 133kb encoding a [[protein]] of 2039 [[amino acid]]s and has a predicted molecular weight of 220 kDa. Large [[insertion (genetics)|insertion]]s and [[deletion (genetics)|deletion]]s have given rise to four structurally variant [[gene]]s and some alleles may extend up to 160 kb and 9 additional exons. The [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] start site has been mapped to 111 bp upstream of the [[translation]] initiation codon ATG and there is another possible start site 29 bp further upstream. The [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] region lacks a distinct [[TATA box]] sequence. The gene is expressed principally on [[erythrocytes]], [[monocytes]], [[neutrophils]] and [[B cells]] but is also present on some [[T lymphocytes]], [[mast cells]] and [[glomerular podocytes]]. 

The mean number of complement receptor 1 (CR1) molecules on erythrocytes in normal individuals lies within the range of 100-1000 molecules per cell. Two [[codominant]] [[allele]]s exist - one controlling high and the other low expression. [[Zygosity|Homozygote]]s differ by a factor of 10-20: [[Zygosity|heterozygotes]] typically have 500-600 copies per erythrocyte. These two alleles appear to have originated before the divergence of the European and African populations. 

==Structure==
The encoded protein has a 47 amino acid [[signal peptide]], an extracellular domain of 1930 residues, a 25 residue transmembrane domain and a 43 amino acid C terminal cytoplasmic region. The [[Five prime untranslated region|leader sequence and 5'-untranslated region]] are contained in one exon. The large extracellular domain of CR1, which has 25 potential [[N-glycosylation]] sites, can be divided into 30 short consensus repeats (SCRs) (also known as [[complement control protein]] repeats (CCPs) or sushi domains), each having 60 to 70 amino acids. The sequence homology between SCRs ranges between 60 to 99 percent. The transmembrane region is encoded by 2 exons and the cytoplasmic domain and the 3'-untranslated regions are coded for by two separate exons.

The 30 or so SCRs are further grouped into four longer regions termed long homologous repeats (LHRs) each encoding approximately 45 kDa of protein and designated LHR-A, -B, -C, and -D. The first three have seven SCRs while LHR-D has 9 or more. Each LHR is composed of 8 exons and within an LHR, SCR 1, 5, and 7 are each encoded by a single exon, SCR 2 and 6 are each encoded by 2 exons, and a single exon codes for SCR 3 and 4. The LHR seem to have arisen as a result of unequal crossing over and the event that gave rise to LHR-B seems to have occurred within the fourth exon of either LHR-A or –C.  To date the atomic structure have been solved for SCRs 15-16, 16 & 16-17.

==Alleles==
Four alleles are known with predicted protein molecular weights of 190 kDa, 220 kDa, 250 kDa and 280kDa are known. Multiple size variants (55kDa-220kDa) are also found among non-human [[primate]]s and a partial amino-terminal duplication (CR1-like gene) that encodes the short (55kDa-70kDa) forms expressed on non human erythrocytes. These short CR1 forms, some of which are [[glycosylphosphatidylinositol]] (GPI) anchored, are expressed on erythrocytes and the 220kDa molecular weight CR1 form is expressed on monocytes. The gene including the repeats is highly conserved in primates possibly because of the ability of the repeats to bind complement. LHR-A binds preferentially to the complement component C4b: LHR-B and LHR-C bind to C3b and also, albeit with a lower affinity, to C4b. Curiously the human CR1 gene appears to have an unusual protein conformation but the significance of this finding is not clear. 

==Rosetting==
''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) interacts with uninfected erythrocytes. This 'stickiness', known as [[rosetting]], is believed to be a strategy used by the [[parasite]] to remain sequestered in the [[Microcirculation|microvasculature]] to avoid destruction in the [[spleen]] and [[liver]]. Erythrocyte rosetting causes obstruction of the [[blood]] flow in [[microcapillaries]]. There is a direct interaction between PfEMP1 and a functional site of complement receptor type 1 on uninfected erythrocytes.

==Role in blood Groups==
The [[Knops antigen]] was the 25th blood group system recognized and consists of the single [[antigen]] [[York]] (Yk) a with the following allelic pairs: 
* Knops (Kn) a and b
* [[McCoy (allelic pair)|McCoy]] (McC) a and b
* [[Swain-Langley]] (Sl) 1 and 2

The antigen is known to lie within the CR1 protein repeats and was first described in 1970 in a 37-year-old [[whites|Caucasian]] woman. Racial differences exist in the frequency of these antigens: 98.5% and 96.7% of [[United States|American]] Caucasians and [[Africa]]ns respectively are positive for McC(a). 36% of a Mali population were Kn(a) and 14% of exhibited the null (or Helgeson) phenotype compared with only 1% in the American population. The frequencies of McC (b) and Sl (2) are higher in Africans compared with [[Europe]]ans and while the frequency of McC (b) was similar between Africans from the [[USA]] or [[Mali]], the Sl (b) phenotype is significantly more common in Mali - 39% and 65% respectively. In Gambia the Sl (2)/McC(b) phenotype appears to have been positively selected - presumably due to malaria. 80% of [[Papua New Guinea]]ns have the [[Helgeson]] [[phenotype]] and [[case control studies]] suggest this phenotype has a protective effect against severe [[malaria]].
