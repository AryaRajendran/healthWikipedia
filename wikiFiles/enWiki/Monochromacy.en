'''Monochromacy''', also known as "total color blindness",<ref name="Tiresias">[http://www.tiresias.org/accessible_ict/colour_blindness.htm "Colour Blindness."] Tiresias.org. Accessed September 29, 2006.</ref> is a complete inability to distinguish colors.<ref name="Cassin">Cassin, B. and Solomon, S. ''Dictionary of Eye Terminology''. Gainsville, Florida: Triad Publishing Company, 1990.</ref> This is distinguished from more common forms of [[color blindness]], in which the affected individual ''can'' perceive color differences, but cannot make the same distinctions between colors as can an unaffected person.

Organisms with monochromacy are called ''monochromats''. The perceptual effect of any arbitrarily chosen light from the [[visible spectrum]] can be matched by any pure spectral light.

==Causes==
In vertebrates there are typically two kinds of receptors: [[rod cell|rods]], which primarily distinguish between levels of illumination, and [[cone cell|cones]], which are responsible for perception of [[color]].  There are different types of cones; each perceives only a single color.  The normal explanation of monochromacy is that the organism's [[retina]] contains only a single kind of light receptor cell, or at least that only one kind is active at any particular level of illumination.  Monochromacy is caused by either a defect or the complete absence of the retinal [[Cone cell|cone]]s.<ref name="Tiresias"/>

Some individuals possess diseases or injuries that lead to [[nyctalopia]], or night blindness, where rod cells stop responding properly to light.

==Types==
There are two known types of monochromacy.<ref name="Alpern">Alpern M. [http://www.iovs.org/cgi/reprint/13/9/648.pdf "What is it that confines in a world without color?"] ''Invest Ophthalmol.'' 1974 Sep;13(9):648-74. PMID 4605446.</ref><ref>Hansen E. "Typical and atypical monochromacy studied by specific quantitative perimetry." ''Acta Ophthalmol (Copenh).'' 1979 Apr;57(2):211-24. PMID 313135.</ref> "Animals with monochromatic vision may be either rod monochromats or cone monochromats. These monochromats contain photoreceptors which have a single spectral sensitivity curve."<ref name=Ali&Klyne1985>{{cite book|last=Ali|first=Mohamed Ather|last2=Klyne|first2=M.A.|title=Vision in Vertebrates|place=New York|publisher=Plenum Press|year=1985|page=162|isbn=0-306-42065-1}}</ref> There is also a third, theoretical type that has never been identified.
*'''Rod monochromacy''' is the condition of having only rods in the retina.  A rod monochromat is truly unable to see any color and can see only shades of grey.
*'''Cone monochromacy''' is the condition of having both rods and cones, but only a single kind of cone. A cone monochromat can have good pattern vision at normal daylight levels, but will not be able to distinguish hues.  In humans, who have three different types of cones, there are three differing forms of cone monochromacy.<ref name="Cassin" /> There are three types named according to the single functioning cone class:
#Blue cone monochromacy, also known as S-cone monochromacy<ref name="Tiresias"/>
#Green cone monochromacy, also known as M-cone monochromacy<ref name="Tiresias"/>
#Red cone monochromacy, also known as L-cone monochromacy<ref name="Tiresias"/>
*'''Cone monochromacy, type II''', if its existence were established, would be the case in which the retina contains no rods, and only a single type of cone. Such an animal would be unable to see at all at lower levels of illumination, and of course would be unable to distinguish hues. In practice it is hard to produce an example of such a retina, at least as the normal condition for a species.

==Animals that are monochromats==
It used to be confidently claimed that most [[mammal]]s other than [[primate]]s were monochromats.  In the last half-century, however, evidence of at least [[dichromat]]ic color vision in a number of mammalian [[order (biology)|orders]] has accumulated.  Two of the orders of sea mammals, the [[pinniped]]s (which includes the seal, sea lion, and walrus) and [[cetacean]]s (which includes dolphins and whales) clearly are cone monochromats, since the short-wavelength sensitive cone system is genetically disabled in these animals.  The same is true of the [[owl monkey]]s, genus ''Aotus''.

Both rod and cone monochromacy occur as very rare forms of color blindness in humans.  Rod monochromacy, or maskun, is the more common of the two.  The majority of people described as [[Color blindness|color blind]], however, are either [[dichromat]]s or anomalous [[trichromat]]s.

==Monochromat capability==

According to [[Jay Neitz]], a renowned color vision researcher at the [[University of Washington]], each of the three standard color-detecting cones in the retina of [[trichromat]]s &mdash; [[blue]], [[green]] and [[red]] &mdash; can pick up about 100 different gradations of color. The brain can process the combinations of these three values so that the average human can distinguish about one million different hues.<ref name="Roth 2006" >{{cite web
