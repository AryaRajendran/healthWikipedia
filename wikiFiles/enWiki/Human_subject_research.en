'''Human subject research''' is a systematic investigation that can be either research or clinically oriented and involves the use of human subjects in any capacity.<ref name="uci">{{cite web | url = http://www.research.uci.edu/ora/hrpp/definition.htm| title = Definition of Human Subject Research| publisher = Research Administration, [[University of California, Irvine]] | accessdate = 2012-01-04}}</ref> Systematic investigation incorporates both the collection and analysis of data in order to answer a specific question.  Examples of research oriented investigation include surveys, questionnaires, [[interviews]], and [[focus groups]].  Examples of clinically oriented investigation include analysis of [[biological specimens]], [[epidemiological]] and behavioral studies and medical chart review studies.<ref name="uci"/> Human subject research is used in various fields including research on basic [[biology]], clinical [[medicine]], [[nursing]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], and [[anthropology]]. As research has become formalized the academic community has developed formal definitions of "human subject research", largely in response to abuses of human subjects.

==Ethical guidelines ==
Ethical guidelines that govern the use of human subjects in research are a fairly new construct. It wasn’t until 1906 that specific regulations were put in place to protect subjects from abuses. After the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906, regulatory bodies were gradually institutionalized such as the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and the [[Institutional Review Board]] (IRB). The policies that these institutions implemented served to minimize harm to the participant's mental and/or physical wellbeing.

===International===

====Nuremberg Code====
{{main|Nuremberg Code}}
In 1947, German physicians who conducted deadly or debilitating experiments on concentration camp prisoners underwent criminal proceedings in the [[Nuremberg Trials]]. That same year, following the Nuremberg Trials, the Nuremberg Code was established. The Nuremberg Code was the first international document that supported the concept that "the voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential". The emphasis that was placed on individual consent in the Nuremberg Code was aimed at keeping participants informed of the risk-benefit outcomes of experiments.

====Declaration of Helsinki====
{{main|Declaration of Helsinki}}
The Declaration of Helsinki was established in 1964 as a means of governing international research. Established by the [[World Medical Association]], the declaration recommended guidelines for medical doctors conducting [[biomedical research]] that involves human subjects.Some of these guidelines included the principles that “research protocols should be reviewed by an independent committee prior to initiation" and that “research with humans should be based on results from laboratory animals and experimentation”.

===United States===

====Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendment====
{{main|Kefauver Harris Amendment}}
In 1962, the Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendment was passed by the United States Congress. This amendment made changes to the Federal Food Drug & Consumer Act by requiring drug companies to prove both safety and effectiveness of their products. Consequently, drugs were then required to have [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval before being marketed to consumers. Additionally, informed consent became a participation requirement and rules were put into place.This regulation was influenced by the 1950 [[thalidomide]] incident in Western Europe where pregnant mothers were prescribed the [[sedative]] thalidomide which was inaccurately marketed as sleeping pills. This incident lead to the deformity of over 12,000 newborns.

====National Research Act/Belmont Report====
{{main|Belmont Report}}
As a consequence of the political outcomes of the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment, the [[National Research Act]] was passed in 1974. This act lead to the creation of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The commission was given the responsibility of drafting the Belmont Report and was tasked with determining the boundary between research and routine practice, the role of [[risk-benefit analysis]], guidelines for participation and the definition of informed consent.  The report established three tenets of ethical research, respect for persons, [[beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] and justice.<ref>{{citation | url = http://videocast.nih.gov/pdf/ohrp_belmont_report.pdf | format = pdf | author = [[National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research]] | date = 1978-09-30 | title = The Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research | publisher = [[United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] }}</ref>

==Human subjects==
The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS) defines a human research subject as a living individual about whom a research investigator (whether a professional or a student) obtains data through 1) intervention or interaction with the individual, or 2) identifiable private information (32 CFR 219.102.f). (Lim,1990)<ref name="utexas">{{cite web | url = http://www.utexas.edu/research/rsc/humansubjects/whatis.html | title = What is Human Subjects Research? |publisher = [[University of Texas at Austin]]| accessdate = 2012-01-04}}</ref>

As defined by DHHS regulations:
 
"Intervention"- physical procedures by which data is gathered and the manipulation of the subject and/or their environment for research purposes [45 CFR 46.102(f)<ref name="utexas"/>

"Interaction"- communication or interpersonal contact between investigator and subject [45 CFR 46.102(f)])<ref name="utexas"/>

"Private Information"-  information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information which has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and which the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public [45 CFR 46.102(f)] )]<ref name="utexas"/>

"Identifiable information"- specific information that can be used to identify an individual<ref name="utexas"/>

===Human subject abuses===
====18th- 19th century====
Human subject research experiments were recorded during vaccination trials in the 18th century. In these early trials, physicians used themselves or their slaves as test subjects. Experiments on others were often conducted without informing the subjects of dangers associated with such experiments. A famous example of such research were the [[Edward Jenner]] experiments, where he tested [[smallpox]] vaccines on his son and neighbourhood [[children]].

====20th century====
In the 20th century, as the progress of medicine began to accelerate, the concept of the various [[Ethical code|codes of ethics]] of scientific disciplines changed dramatically, and the treatment of research subjects along with it.

[[Walter Reed]]'s experiments to develop an [[inoculation]] for [[yellow fever]] led these advances. Reed's [[vaccine]] experiments were carefully scrutinized, however, unlike earlier trials.<ref>{{cite book | last = Brady | first = JV | coauthors = Jonsen AR | chapter = The Evolution of Regulatory Influences on Research with Human Subjects | title = Human Subjects Research: A Handbook for Institutional Review Boards | editors = Greenwald RA ''et al.'' | location = New York | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Plenum Press]] | year = 1982 | pages = 4}}</ref>

=====World War II=====

[[File:Unit 731 - Complex .jpg|thumb|Unit 731 Complex that used humans for experimentation for biological and chemical weapons, as well as live vivisections and other experiments]]

Infamous cases of human subject abuse in the 20th century were conducted during World War II by the Imperial Japanese Army ([[Unit 731]] in China) and the Nazis, the latter an example of [[Experimentation on prisoners|research involving prisoners]] which came to light in the Nuremberg [[Doctors' Trial]] and led to the [[Nuremberg Code]] of ethical conduct for human subject research. Research in the second half of the 20th century has been characterized by increasing attempts to protect human subjects through national agencies, institutional ethical review boards, and informed consent.

=====Britain=====
De-classified documents of the National Archives revealed that during the 1930s and 1940s, the [[British Army]] used hundreds of Irish and native [[British Indian Army]] soldiers as "guinea pigs" in their experiments to determine if [[mustard gas]] inflicted greater damage on Indian skin compared to British skin. It is unclear whether the trial subjects, some of whom were hospitalised by their injuries, were all volunteers.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2007-09-02-voa11.html | title = Report: Britain Tested Chemical Weapons on Indian Colonial Troops | publisher = [[Voice of America]] | date = 2007-09-02 | accessdate = 2011-06-02 }}</ref>

=====United States=====
Fort Detrick in Maryland was the headquarters of US biological warfare experiments. [[Operation Whitecoat]] involved the injection of infectious agents to observe their effects in human subjects.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/file_on_4/4701196.stm | work= [[BBC News]] | title=Hidden history of US germ testing | date= 2006-02-13 | accessdate=2010-05-04 }}</ref>

=====Japan=====
Human subject research in Japan began in World War II but continued for some years after, since the [[American occupation of Japan]] secretly pardoned all those who did human research.

[[Unit 731]], a department of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] located near [[Harbin]] (then puppet state of [[Manchukuo]], in northeast China), experimented with prisoner [[vivisection]], dismemberment, bacteria inoculation and induced epidemics on a very large scale from 1932 onward through the [[Second Sino-Japanese war]]. They also used prisoners and captured POWs for testing with biological and chemical weapons. With the expansion of the empire during [[World War II]], many other units were implemented in conquered cities such as [[Nanking]] ([[Unit 1644]]), [[Beijing]] ([[Unit 1855]]), [[Guangzhou]] ([[Unit 8604]]) and [[Singapore]] ([[Unit 9420]]). After the war, Supreme commander of occupation [[Douglas MacArthur]] gave immunity in the name of the [[United States]] to [[Shiro Ishii]] and all members of the units in exchange for all of the results.<ref>{{cite book | last = Gold | first = H | isbn = 0-8048-3565-9 | title = Unit 731 Testimony | year = 2003 | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=cprBEpxvexgC&pg=PA109#v=onepage&q&f=false 109] | publisher = [[Tuttle Publishing]] | edition = 5}}</ref> The [[United States]] blocked [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] access to this information; some unit members were judged by the [[Soviets]] during the [[Khabarovsk War Crime Trials]].

In November 2006, Doctor Akira Makino confessed to Kyodo news that he had performed surgery and amputations on condemned prisoners, including women and children, in 1944 and 1945 while he was stationed on [[Mindanao]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Japanese doctor admits POW abuse |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6185442.stm |date=26 November 2006}}</ref> In 2007, Doctor [[Ken Yuasa]] testified to ''[[The Japan Times]]'' that he believes at least 1,000 persons working for the [[Shōwa period|Shōwa]] regime, including surgeons, did surgical research in mainland China.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hongo |first=Jun |quote=I was afraid during my first vivisection, but the second time around, it was much easier.

=====Guatemalans used for STD experiments=====
{{main|Syphilis experiments in Guatemala}}
U.S. scientific researchers infected hundreds of Guatemalan mental patients with sexually transmitted diseases from 1946 to 1948. Researchers from the U.S. Public Health Service conducted experiments on approximately 1,500 male and female patients housed at Guatemala's National Mental Health Hospital.<ref name=CDCFactScheet>{{cite web | url = http://www.hhs.gov/1946inoculationstudy/factsheet.html | title = Fact Sheet on the 1946-1948 U.S. Public Health Service Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Inoculation Study | publisher = [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] | accessdate = 2013-04-15 | date = nd }}</ref> The scientists injected the patients with gonorrhea and syphilis—and even encouraged many of them to pass the disease on to others. The experiments were done in conjunction with the Guatemalan government. The US Public Health Service carried out the experiments under the guise of syphilis inoculations. When some of the inmates did not contract the disease, the researchers created abrasions on the inmate's body and poured the bacteria into the abrasion. When that failed, they injected the disease straight into the inmates' spines. In 2010 these experiments were revealed by Susan Reverby of [[Wellesley College]] who was researching a book on Tuskegee experiments.  This led to [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] issuing an official apology.<ref name="nyt20101001">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/health/research/02infect.html?_r=0 |title=U.S. Apologizes for Syphilis Experiment |date=1 October 2010 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref>  President [[Barack Obama]] apologized to President [[Álvaro Colom]] who had called these experiments 'a crime against humanity'.<ref name="BBC20101001">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11457552 |title=US medical tests in Guatemala 'crime against humanity' |date=1 October 2010|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref>

=====Sweden=====
In Sweden, the [[Vipeholm experiments]] were conducted, where mentally handicapped test subjects were exposed to large amounts of [[sugar]] to induce [[dental caries]].

=====United Kingdom=====
In the United Kingdom (voluntary) human experimentation at [[Porton Down]] in the 1950s, led to the death of [[Ronald Maddison]].

=====Beecher Paper=====
In a 1966 paper noted anesthesiologist [[Henry K. Beecher]] described 22 published medical studies where patients had been experimented on with no expected benefit to the patient.<ref name="Beecher1966">{{cite pmid|5327352}}</ref>  In one study, for example, patients infused with live cancer cells had been told they were receiving "some cells" without specifying that they were cancer. Though identities of the authors and institutions had been stripped, the 22 studies were later identified as having been conducted by mainstream researchers and published in prestigious journals within approximately the previous decade. The 22 cases had been selected from a set of 50 that Beecher had collected, and he presented evidence that studies he considered unethical were even more widespread and represented a systemic problem in medical research rather than exceptions.<ref name="Beecher1966"/><ref name="Rothman1987">{{cite pmid | 3309660}}</ref>  Though Beecher had been writing about human experimentation and publicizing cases that he considered to be bad practice for nearly a decade, it was a 1965 briefing to science writers and the 1966 paper that finally earned widespread news coverage and stimulated public reaction.<ref name="Rothman1987"/><ref name="Kopp1999">{{cite pmid |10360876}}</ref> The paper has been described as "the most influential single paper ever written about experimentation involving human subjects."<ref name="Harkness2001">{{cite pmid | 11357216}}</ref>  The [[Office for Human Research Protections]] credits this paper as "ultimately contributing to the impetus for the first NIH and FDA regulations."<ref>{{cite web |work=Institutional Review Board Guidebook |title=History of the Human Subjects Protection System |url=http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/archive/irb/irb_introduction.htm |publisher=[[Office for Human Research Protections]] |year=1993 | accessdate = 2011-06-03}}</ref>

In addition to documenting the extent of problems in human subject research, Beecher was instrumental in formulating the solutions. One common aspect to many of Beecher's cases was that some experimental subjects, such as military personnel and mentally handicapped children in institutions, were not in a position to freely decline consent.<ref name="Rothman1987"/>  Beecher believed that rules requiring informed consent were not by themselves sufficient, as truly informed consent was an unattainable ideal. He worked both in defining the rules and conditions for informed consent and in establishing [[institutional review board]]s as an additional layer of oversight regarding research protocols.<ref name="Rothman1987"/><ref name="Kopp1999"/>

====United States====
{{Main|Unethical human experimentation in the United States}}
<!--SEE CITATIONS IN MAIN ARTICLE ABOVE-->

There have been numerous human experiments performed in the United States, which have been considered [[medical ethics|unethical]], and were often performed illegally, without the knowledge, [[consent]], or [[informed consent]] of the test subjects.

Many types of experiments were performed including the deliberately infecting people with deadly or debilitating [[diseases]], exposing people to [[biological weapons|biological]] and [[chemical weapons]], [[human radiation experiments]], injecting people with [[toxic]] and [[radioactive]] chemicals, [[surgical]] experiments, [[interrogation]]/[[torture]] experiments, tests involving [[mind-altering substances]], and a wide variety of others. Many of these tests were performed on [[children]] and [[mentally disabled]] individuals. In many of the studies, a large number of the subjects were [[poverty|poor]] [[racial minorities]] or [[Incarceration|prisoners]].
 
Often, subjects were sick or disabled people, whose doctors told them that they were receiving "medical treatment," but instead were used as the subjects of harmful and deadly experiments, without their knowledge or consent. The ethical, professional, and legal implications of this in the United States medical and scientific community were quite significant, and led to many institutions and policies which attempted to ensure that future human subject research in the United States would be ethical and legal.

Public outcry over the discovery of government experiments on human subjects led to numerous congressional investigations and hearings, including the [[Church Committee]], [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]], and [[Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments]], amongst others.  These inquiries have not resulted in prosecutions and not all subjects involved in the trials have been compensated or notified of their participation.
