'''Metachromatic leukodystrophy ''' ('''MLD''', also called '''Arylsulfatase A deficiency''') is a [[lysosomal storage disease]] which is commonly listed in the family of [[leukodystrophies]] as well as among the [[sphingolipidoses]] as it affects the metabolism of [[sphingolipids]]. Leukodystrophies affect the growth and/or development of [[myelin]], the fatty covering which acts as an insulator around [[nerve]] fibers throughout the [[Central nervous system|central]] and [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] [[nervous system]]s. MLD involves [[cerebroside|cerebroside sulfate]] accumulation.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000954238|metachromatic leukodystrophy}}</ref><ref name=FA>{{cite book|last1=Le|first1=Tao|last2=Bhushan|first2=Vikas|last3=Hofmann |first3=Jeffrey|title=First Aid for the USMLE Step 1|accessdate=25 February 2012|year=2012|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|page=117}}</ref> Metachromatic leukodystrophy, like most enzyme deficiencies, has an [[autosomal recessive]] inheritance pattern.<ref name="FA"/>

== Causes ==
[[File:Inborn errors of metabolism.svg|thumb|Diagram showing the disrupted pathway]]
MLD is directly caused by a deficiency of the enzyme [[arylsulfatase A]]<ref name="pmid15720392">{{cite journal |author=Poeppel P, Habetha M, Marcão A, Büssow H, Berna L, Gieselmann V |title=Missense mutations as a cause of metachromatic leukodystrophy, Degradation of arylsulfatase A in the endoplasmic reticulum |journal=FEBS J. |volume=272 |issue=5 |pages=1179–88 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15720392 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-4658.2005.04553.x}}</ref> and is usually characterized by enzyme activity which is less than 10% of human controls.<ref>Fluharty, Arvan. "Arylsulfatase A Deficiency: Metachromatic Leukodystrophy, ARSA Deficiency". GeneReviews, 2006</ref> Without this enzyme, [[sulfatide]]s build up in many tissues of the body, eventually destroying the myelin sheath of the nervous system. The myelin sheath is a fatty covering that protects nerve fibers. Without it, the nerves in the brain (central nervous system - CNS) and the peripheral nerves (peripheral nervous system - PNS) which control, among other things the muscles related to mobility, cease to function properly.

A recent study contended sulfatide is not completely responsible for MLD because it is nontoxic. It has been suggested lysosulfatide, sulfatide which has had its acyl group removed, plays a role because of its cytotoxic properties in vitro.<ref name="Blomqvist 2011">{{cite doi|10.1186/1476-511X-10-28}}</ref>

==Genetics==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|]]

MLD has an [[autosomal recessive]] inheritance pattern. The inheritance probabilities ''per birth'' are as follows:

* If both parents are carriers:
** 25% (1 in 4) children will have the disorder
** 50% (2 in 4) children will be carriers (but unaffected)
** 25% (1 in 4) children will be free of MLD - unaffected child that is not a carrier

* If one parent is affected and one is free of MLD:
** 0% (0) children will have the disorder - only one parent is affected, other parent always gives normal gene
** 100% (4 in 4) children will be carriers (but unaffected)

* If one parent is a carrier and the other is free of MLD:
** 50% (2 in 4) children will be carriers (but unaffected)
** 50% (2 in 4) children will be free of MLD - unaffected child that is not a carrier

In addition to these frequencies there is a 'pseudo'-deficiency that affects 7%-15% of the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hohenschutz|first=C|coauthors=Eich P, Friedl W, Waheed A, Conzelmann E, Propping P.|title=Pseudodeficiency of arylsulfatase A|journal=Human Genetics|year=1989|month=April|volume=45-8|pmid=2565866|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2565866|accessdate=2012-09-30}}</ref><ref name="147-150, DOI: 10.1007/BF00286589">{{cite journal|last=Herz|first=Barbara|coauthors=Bach, G.|journal=HUMAN GENETICS|year=1984|volume=66|pages=147–150|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r705070311k44512/|accessdate=2012-09-30}}</ref> People with the pseudo deficiency do not have any MLD problems unless they also have affected status. With the current diagnostic tests, Pseudo-deficiency reports as low enzyme levels but sulfatide is processed normally so MLD symptoms do not exist.  This phenomenon wreaks havoc with traditional approaches to [[Newborn Screening]] so new screening methods are being developed.

==Incidence==
The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of metachromatic leukodystrophy is estimated to occur in 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 160,000 individuals worldwide.<ref name=ghr/> There is a much higher incidence in certain genetically isolated populations, such as 1 in 75 in [[Habbanite]]s (a small group of Jews who immigrated to Israel from southern Arabia), 1 in 2,500 in the western portion of the [[Navajo Nation]], and 1 in 8,000 among [[Arab]] groups in Israel.<ref name=ghr>[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/metachromatic-leukodystrophy Metachromatic leukodystrophy] at Genetics Home Reference. Reviewed September 2007</ref>

== Symptoms and forms ==
Like many other genetic disorders that affect lipid metabolism, there are several forms of MLD, which are late [[infantile]], [[Child|juvenile]], and adult.

* In the ''late infantile form'', which is the most common form of MLD (50-60%), affected children begin having difficulty walking after the first year of life, usually at 15–24 months. Symptoms include muscle wasting and weakness, [[muscle rigidity]], developmental delays, progressive loss of vision leading to blindness, [[convulsions]], impaired swallowing, [[paralysis]], and [[dementia]]. Children may become [[coma]]tose. Untreated, most children with this form of MLD die by age 5, often much sooner.

* Children with the ''juvenile form'' of MLD (onset between 3 and 10 years of age) usually begin with impaired school performance, mental deterioration, and dementia and then develop symptoms similar to the late infantile form but with slower progression. Age of death is variable, but normally within 10 to 15 years of symptom onset although some juveniles can live for several decades or longer after onset.

* The ''adult form'' commonly begins after age 16 as a [[psychiatric]] disorder or progressive dementia. Adult-onset MLD progresses more slowly than the late infantile and juvenile forms, with a protracted course of a decade or more.

Palliative care can help with many of the symptoms and usually improves quality of life and longevity.

Carriers have low enzyme levels compared to their family population ("normal" levels vary from family to family) but even low enzyme levels are adequate to process the body's sulfatide.

== Treatment ==
There is currently no treatment or cure for MLD. Children with advanced juvenile or adult onset and late infantile patients displaying symptoms receive treatment limited to pain and symptom management.  Presymptomatic late infantile MLD patients, as well as those with juvenile or adult MLD that are either presymptomatic or displaying mild to moderate symptoms, have the option of [[bone marrow transplantation]] (including [[stem cell transplantation]]), which is under investigation to see if it may slow down progression of the disease or stop its progression in the central nervous system. However, results in the peripheral nervous system have been less dramatic, and the long-term results of these therapies have been mixed.

Several future treatment options are currently being investigated. These include [[gene therapy]], [[enzyme replacement therapy]] (ERT), [[substrate reduction therapy]] (SRT), and potentially enzyme enhancement therapy (EET).

A team of international researchers and foundations organized in 2008 to form an [http://www.MLDregistry.org International MLD Registry] to create and manage a shared repository of knowledge, including the [[natural history]] of MLD. This consortium consists of scientific, academic and industry resources. This registry never became operational.<ref name="reference">[http://www.MLDregistry.org MLD Registry http://www.MLDregistry.org]</ref>

== Clinical trials ==

===Bone marrow and stem cell transplant therapies===
* Several trials are underway to continue to improve the effectiveness and reduce the risks of [[bone marrow transplant|bone marrow]] and [[stem cell transplant]]s. Cord blood transplants and reduced preparative routines are being studied.
* Families are cautioned that there are hucksters usually operating in Central or South America or China that would be happy to take your money and have you believe stem cell infusions will "cure" MLD. These claims are false.<ref>[http://mldfoundation.org/research-current.html http://mldfoundation.org/research-current.html]</ref><ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-18560_162-6402854.html http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-18560_162-6402854.html]</ref><ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57354695/stem-cell-fraud-an-investigation http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57354695/stem-cell-fraud-an-investigation]</ref>

===Gene therapy===
{{main|Gene therapy}}
Two different approaches to gene therapy are currently being researched for MLD.
* '''Gene therapy with an [[autologous]] stem cell transplant''' - Italian researchers at the [http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=it&u=http://www.sanraffaele.org/&prev=/search%3Fq%3DSan%2BRaffaele%2BScientific%2BInstitute%26hl%3Den%26hs%3DWgi%26lr%3D%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official San Raffaele Telethon Institute]  are testing a novel approach combining gene therapy with a stem cell transplant.<ref name="pmid18978739">{{cite journal |author=Biffi A, Lucchini G, Rovelli A, Sessa M |title=Metachromatic leukodystrophy: an overview of current and prospective treatments |journal=Bone Marrow Transplant. |volume=42 Suppl 2 |issue= |pages=S2–6 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18978739 |doi=10.1038/bmt.2008.275}}</ref> Recruiting for the Phase I/II Clinical Trial formally started on March 24, 2010 after approval from the Italian Authorities. Recruiting the initial cohort of 8 patients was completed in mid-March 2013. The trial is testing the efficacy and safety of [[Autologous blood donation|autologous]] (using the patient's own cells) [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] (HSCT) after genetic modification to deliver a super-therapeutic (over-expressing) ARSA enzyme to the nervous system by the route of the blood cells. Using the patient's own stem cells with genetic correction should reduce or eliminate the complications of graft vs. host disease and provide a long term solution to proper ARSA expression in MLD patients. Bench and animal tests showed positive results. The researchers are preparing (March 2013) to publish 2-year outcomes for the first three patients – families of early participants are reporting good outcomes.
** Inclusion criteria are pre-symptomatic late infantiles and both pre- and early-symptomatic juveniles.

* '''Intracerebral Gene therapy''' - A Phase I/II Clinical Trial started recruiting in Paris in late March, 2013 for an Intracerebral Gene Therapy clinical trial where special "vectors" carrying genetically modified material are directly injected into a dozen sites in the brain. The hope is that the corrected cells and the enzyme they produce will then diffuse into surrounding areas of the brain. Extensive work in the lab and and some encouraging [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22365775 ALD studies] provided the basis for this trial.

* [http://Biomarin.com Biomarin] South (formerly Zacharon before being acquired by Biomarin in January 2013<ref>[http://investors.bmrn.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=731764]</ref>) from San Diego has initiated a drug discovery program for MLD.  This program is based on using assays which measure sulfatide accumulation in cultured fibroblasts as a means to discover and develop small molecule drugs for MLD.  (This approach differs from other approaches which have measured enzyme activity to discover effective drugs.)  As of July 2011, Zacharon has begun adapting the assays it developed for other lysosomal storage diseases so that they can be employed to discover and develop drugs for MLD. ''(current March 2013)''
