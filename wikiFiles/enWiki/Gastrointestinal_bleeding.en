'''Gastrointestinal bleeding''' or '''gastrointestinal hemorrhage''' describes every form of [[hemorrhage]] (loss of [[blood]]) in the [[gastrointestinal tract]], from the [[pharynx]] to the [[rectum]]. It has diverse causes, and a medical history, as well as [[physical examination]], generally distinguishes between the main forms. The degree of bleeding can range from nearly undetectable to acute, massive, life-threatening bleeding.

Initial emphasis is on resuscitation by infusion of [[intravenous therapy|intravenous fluids]] and [[blood transfusion]]. Treatment with [[proton pump inhibitor]]s, [[octreotide]], and [[antibiotics]] may be considered in certain cases. [[Upper endoscopy]] or [[colonoscopy]] are generally considered appropriate to identify the source of bleeding and carry out treatment.

==Signs and symptoms==
Gastrointestinal bleeding can range from microscopic bleeding, where the amount of blood is such that it can only be detected by laboratory testing, to massive bleeding where bright red blood is passed and [[hypovolemia]] and [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] may develop.
Blood that is digested may appear black rather than red, resulting in "coffee ground" vomitus or stool.<ref name=EBMED2004>{{cite journal|last=Westhoff|first=John|title=Gastrointestinal Bleeding: An Evidence-Based ED Approach To Risk Stratification|journal=Emergency Medicine Practice|year=2004|month=March|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://www.ebmedicine.net/topics.php?paction=showTopic&topic_id=75}}</ref>

==Differential diagnosis==
Gastrointestinal bleeding can be roughly divided into two clinical syndromes: [[upper gastrointestinal bleeding]] and [[lower gastrointestinal bleeding]].<ref name=EBMED2004/> Types of causes include: [[infection]]s, [[cancer]]s, vascular disorders, adverse effects of medications, and [[Coagulopathy|blood clotting disorders]].<ref name=EBMED2004/>

===Upper gastrointestinal===
{{main|Upper gastrointestinal bleeding}}
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is from a source between the [[pharynx]] and the [[Suspensory muscle of duodenum|ligament of Treitz]]. An upper source is characterised by [[hematemesis]] (vomiting up blood) and [[melena]] (tarry stool containing altered blood). About half of cases are due to peptic ulcer disease.<ref name=Epi2008>{{cite journal|last=van Leerdam|first=ME|title=Epidemiology of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.|journal=Best practice & research. Clinical gastroenterology|year=2008|volume=22|issue=2|pages=209–24|pmid=18346679|doi=10.1016/j.bpg.2007.10.011}}</ref> [[Esophagitis]] and erosive disease is the next most common causes.<ref name=Epi2008/> In those with [[liver cirrhosis]] 50–60% of bleeding is due to [[esophageal varices]].<ref name=Epi2008/> Approximately half of those with peptic ulcers have an ''[[H. pylori]]'' infection.<ref name=Epi2008/> Other causes include: [[gastric ulcers|gastric]] or [[duodenal ulcers]], [[Mallory-Weiss tears]], cancer, and [[angiodysplasia]].<ref name=EBMED2004/>

A number of medications are found to cause upper GI bleeds.<ref name=SIGN2008/> [[NSAIDs]] or [[COX-2 inhibitors]] increase the risk about fourfold.<ref name=SIGN2008/> [[SSRIs]], [[corticosteroids]], and [[anticoagulants]] may also increase the risk.<ref name=SIGN2008/> The risk with [[dabigatran]] is 30% greater than that with [[warfarin]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Coleman|first=CI|coauthors=Sobieraj, DM, Winkler, S, Cutting, P, Mediouni, M, Alikhanov, S, Kluger, J|title=Effect of pharmacological therapies for stroke prevention on major gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation.|journal=International journal of clinical practice|date=2012 Jan|volume=66|issue=1|pages=53–63|pmid=22093613|doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2011.02809.x}}</ref>

===Lower gastrointestinal===
{{main|Lower gastrointestinal bleeding}}
Lower gastrointestinal bleeding is typically from the colon, rectum or anus.<ref name=EBMED2004/> Causes include: [[hemorrhoid]]s, cancer, angiodysplasia, colitis, and [[aortoenteric fistula]].<ref name=EBMED2004/> It may be indicated by red blood ''per rectum'', especially in the absence of [[hematemesis]]. Isolated melena may originate from anywhere between the stomach and the proximal colon.

===Other===
A number of foods and medications can turn the stool either red or black.<ref name=EBMED2004/> [[Bismuth]] found in many antacids may turn stools black as may [[activated charcoal]].<ref name=EBMED2004/> Blood from the vagina or urinary tract may also be confused with blood in the stool.<ref name=EBMED2004/>

==Diagnostic approach==
Diagnosis is often based on direct observation of blood in the stool or vomit.  This can be confirmed with a [[fecal occult blood]] test. Differentiating between upper and lower bleeding in some cases can be difficult. The severity of an upper GI bleed can be judged based on the [[Blatchford score]]<ref name=Overall2011/> or [[Rockall score]].<ref name=SIGN2008/> The Rockall score is the more accurate of the two.<ref name=SIGN2008/> AS of 2008 there is no scoring system useful for lower GI bleeds.<ref name=SIGN2008/>

===Clinical===
[[Gastric lavage|Gastric aspiration and or lavage]], where a tube is inserted into the stomach via the nose in an attempt to determine if there is blood in the stomach, if negative does not rule out an upper GI bleed<ref>{{cite journal|last=Palamidessi|first=N|coauthors=Sinert, R, Falzon, L, Zehtabchi, S|title=Nasogastric aspiration and lavage in emergency department patients with hematochezia or melena without hematemesis.|journal=Academic emergency medicine |date=2010 Feb|volume=17|issue=2|pages=126–32|pmid=20370741|doi=10.1111/j.1553-2712.2009.00609.x}}</ref> but if positive is useful for ruling one in.<ref name=JAMA2012>{{cite journal |author=Srygley FD, Gerardo CJ, Tran T, Fisher DA |title=Does this patient have a severe upper gastrointestinal bleed? |journal=JAMA |volume=307 |issue=10 |pages=1072–9 |year=2012 |month=March |pmid=22416103 |doi=10.1001/jama.2012.253 |url=}}</ref> Clots in the stool indicate a lower GI source while melana stools an upper one.<ref name=JAMA2012/>

===Laboratory testing===
Recommended laboratory blood testing includes: cross matching blood, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, coagulation time, and electrolytes.<ref name=Overall2011/> If the ratio of [[blood urea nitrogen]] to [[creatinine]] is greater than 30 the source is more likely from the upper GI tract.<ref name=JAMA2012/>

===Imaging===
A [[CT angiography]] is useful for determining the exact location of the bleeding within the gastrointestinal tract.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wu|first=LM|coauthors=Xu, JR, Yin, Y, Qu, XH|title=Usefulness of CT angiography in diagnosing acute gastrointestinal bleeding: a meta-analysis.|journal=World journal of gastroenterology : WJG|date=2010-08-21|volume=16|issue=31|pages=3957–63|pmid=20712058|pmc=2923771|doi=10.3748/wjg.v16.i31.3957}}</ref>

==Prevention==
In those with significant varices or cirrhosis [[Adrenergic_beta-antagonist#Non-selective|nonselective β-blockers]] reduce the risk of future bleeding.<ref name=N2010/> With a target heart rate of 55&nbsp;beats per minute they reduce the absolute risk of bleeding by 10%.<ref name=N2010/> [[Therapeutic endoscopy|Endoscopic band ligation]] (EBL) is also effective at improving outcomes.<ref name=N2010/> Either B-blockers or EBL are recommended as initial preventative measures.<ref name=N2010/> In those who have had a previous varcial bleed both treatments are recommended.<ref name=N2010/> With some evidence supporting the addition of [[isosorbide mononitrate]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Li|first=L|coauthors=Yu, C, Li, Y|title=Endoscopic band ligation versus pharmacological therapy for variceal bleeding in cirrhosis: a meta-analysis|journal=Canadian journal of gastroenterology = Journal canadien de gastroenterologie|date=2011 Mar|volume=25|issue=3|pages=147–55|pmid=21499579|pmc=3076033}}</ref> Testing for and treating those who are positive for ''[[H. pylori]]'' is recommended.<ref name=SIGN2008/> [[Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt]]ing (TIPS) may be used to prevent bleeding in people who re-bleed despite other measures.<ref name=SIGN2008/>

==Treatment==
The initial focus is on [[resuscitation]] beginning with airway management and fluid resuscitation using either intravenous fluids and or blood.<ref name=Overall2011>{{cite journal|last=Jairath|first=V|coauthors=Barkun, AN|title=The overall approach to the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding|journal=Gastrointestinal endoscopy clinics of North America|date=2011 Oct|volume=21|issue=4|pages=657–70|pmid=21944416|doi=10.1016/j.giec.2011.07.001}}</ref> A number of medications may improve outcomes depending on the source of the bleeding.<ref name=Overall2011/>

Based on evidence from people with other health problems [[Crystalloid solution|crystalloid]] and [[Volume_expander#Colloids|colloids]] are believed to be equivalent for peptic ulcer bleeding.<ref name=Overall2011/> [[Proton pump inhibitor]]s may reduce mortality in those with severe disease as well as the risk of re-bleeding and the need for surgery among this group.<ref name=PPI2007>{{cite journal|last=Leontiadis|first=GI|coauthors=Sreedharan, A, Dorward, S, Barton, P, Delaney, B, Howden, CW, Orhewere, M, Gisbert, J, Sharma, VK, Rostom, A, Moayyedi, P, Forman, D|title=Systematic reviews of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of proton pump inhibitors in acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding|journal=Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)|date=2007 Dec|volume=11|issue=51|pages=iii–iv, 1–164|pmid=18021578}}</ref> In those with less severe disease and where endoscopy is rapidly available, they are of less immediate clinical importance.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sreedharan|first=A|coauthors=Martin, J, Leontiadis, GI, Dorward, S, Howden, CW, Forman, D, Moayyedi, P|title=Proton pump inhibitor treatment initiated prior to endoscopic diagnosis in upper gastrointestinal bleeding|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2010-07-07|issue=7|pages=CD005415|pmid=20614440|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005415.pub3|editor1-last=Sreedharan|editor1-first=Aravamuthan}}</ref> The evidence for the inhibition of fibrinolysis with [[tranexamic acid]] is insufficient to recommend its use.<ref name=Overall2011/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Gluud|first=LL|coauthors=Klingenberg, SL, Langholz, E|title=Tranexamic acid for upper gastrointestinal bleeding|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2012-01-18|volume=1|pages=CD006640|pmid=22258969|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006640.pub2|editor1-last=Gluud|editor1-first=Lise Lotte}}</ref> [[Somatostatin]] and [[octreotide]], while recommended for varicial bleeding, have not been found to be of general use for non varicial bleeds.<ref name=Overall2011/>

===Variceal bleeding===
For initial fluid replacement colloids or [[albumin]] is preferred in people with cirrhosis.<ref name=Overall2011/> Medications typically include [[octreotide]] or, if not available, [[vasopression]] and [[nitroglycerin]] to reduce portal pressures.<ref name=N2010/> [[Terlipressin]] appears to be more effective than octreotide, but it is not available in many areas of the world.<ref name=SIGN2008/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Ioannou|first=G|coauthors=Doust, J, Rockey, DC|title=Terlipressin for acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|year=2003|issue=1|pages=CD002147|pmid=12535432|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002147|editor1-last=Ioannou|editor1-first=George N}}</ref> This is in addition to [[Therapeutic endoscopy|endoscopic banding]] or [[sclerotherapy]] for the varicies.<ref name=N2010/> If this is sufficient then [[beta blockers]] and [[nitrates]] may be used for the prevention of re-bleeding.<ref name=N2010/> If bleeding continues then balloon tamponade with a [[Sengstaken-Blakemore tube]] or [[Minnesota tube]] may be used in an attempt to mechanically compress the varicies.<ref name=N2010/> This may then be followed by a [[transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt]].<ref name=N2010/> In those with cirrhosis [[antibiotics]] decrease the chance of re bleeding, shorten the length of time spent in hospital, and decrease mortality.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chavez-Tapia|first=NC|coauthors=Barrientos-Gutierrez, T, Tellez-Avila, F, Soares-Weiser, K, Mendez-Sanchez, N, Gluud, C, Uribe, M|title=Meta-analysis: antibiotic prophylaxis for cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding – an updated Cochrane review|journal=Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics|date=2011 Sep|volume=34|issue=5|pages=509–18|pmid=21707680|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2011.04746.x}}</ref> Octreotide reduces the need for blood transfusions<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gøtzsche|first=PC|coauthors=Hróbjartsson, A|title=Somatostatin analogues for acute bleeding oesophageal varices|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2008-07-16|issue=3|pages=CD000193|pmid=18677774|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000193.pub3|editor1-last=Gøtzsche|editor1-first=Peter C}}</ref> and may decrease mortality.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wells|first=M|coauthors=Chande, N; Adams, P; Beaton, M; Levstik, M; Boyce, E; Mrkobrada, M|title=Meta-analysis: vasoactive medications for the management of acute variceal bleeds|journal=Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics|date=2012 Jun|volume=35|issue=11|pages=1267–78|pmid=22486630|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2012.05088.x}}</ref> No trials of [[vitamin K]] have been conducted.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Martí-Carvajal|first=AJ|coauthors=Cortés-Jofré, M, Martí-Peña, AJ|title=Vitamin K for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver diseases|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2008-07-16|issue=3|pages=CD004792|pmid=18677778|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004792.pub3|editor1-last=Martí-Carvajal|editor1-first=Arturo J}}</ref>
