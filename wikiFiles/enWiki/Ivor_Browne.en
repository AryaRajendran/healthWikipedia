After Blackrock College, he went to a secretarial school, and gained admission to the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland|Royal College of Surgeons]]. He said that his intention was to become a jazz musician and that he only took up medicine to please his parents. During his time in the college of surgeons, he had several bouts of [[tuberculosis]], which diverted him from being a musician.<ref name=indo2008a/>

==Career==
In 1955, he became a qualified doctor. According to Browne, his professor of medicine in the Richmond Hospital told him that: "You're only fit to be an obstetrician or a psychiatrist." He had little interest in general medicine, and decided to become a psychiatrist. He started his internship in a [[neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] unit, where he assisted a surgeon.<ref name=indo2008a/> He said of his work there: {{Cquote|Nearly every Saturday morning one or two patients would be sent down from [[Grangegorman]] to have their brains 'chopped'... this was the major [[lobotomy]] procedure... where burr holes were drilled on each side of the temples and a blunt instrument inserted to sever the frontal lobes almost completely from the rest of the brain.<ref name=indo2008a/>}}

Browne went on to work both in the [[UK]] and in the [[US]]; He was awarded a scholarship to study public and community mental health in [[Harvard]].<ref name=cork>{{Citation

He said: {{Cquote|When someone is depressed, [doctors] assume that this is caused by a disturbance in your biochemistry, which must be related to some sort of genetic thing in your personality. What I would want to know is what has happened in that person's past and their present that is disturbing their biochemistry and making them depressed? Our behaviour has an immediate and far-reaching effect on our chemical balance, but that question's not asked. Even as you and I are sitting here discussing this, there are all sorts of changes happening in your neurochemistry and in your body - so it's highly dynamic.<ref name=post2008/>}} 
He has used psychiatric medications with his patients, but he says that he uses a fraction of the drugs prescribed by modern psychiatrists.<ref name=post2008/>

Phyllis Hamilton said that she believed that he had acted properly when disclosing information about her relationship with Michael Cleary.<ref name="times1997">{{cite news|last=O'Toole|first=Fintan|authorlink=Fintan O'Toole|title=Medical body censured Browne but ruled he acted for patient|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/1997/0111/97011100003.html|accessdate=17 June 2010|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=11 January 1997}}</ref>
