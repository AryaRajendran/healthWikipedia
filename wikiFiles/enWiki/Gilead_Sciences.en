'''Gilead Sciences''' is an American [[biotechnology]] company that discovers, develops and commercializes [[therapeutics]]. For many years since the company was founded, the company concentrated primarily on [[antiviral drug]]s to treat patients infected with [[HIV]], [[hepatitis B]], or [[influenza]]. In 2006, Gilead acquired two companies that were developing drugs to treat patients with [[lung|pulmonary]] diseases. The company has fourteen commercially available products. Headquartered and founded in [[Foster City, California]], Gilead has operations in North America, Europe and Australia.  As of the end of 2009, the company had approximately 4,000 full-time employees.<ref name="GILD_2009_10K"/> The company's name and logo refer to the [[Balm of Gilead]]. [[Gilead]] (a place mentioned in the Bible) was famed for its small trees that produced a [[resin]] used in medicine.

Gilead is a member of the [[NASDAQ Biotechnology Index]] and the [[S&P 500]].

==History==
Gilead Sciences was originally formed at [[Menlo Ventures]] under the name of "Oligogen, Inc." in August 1987 by H. DuBose Montgomery, co-founder of [[Menlo Ventures]] and Michael L. Riordan, a medical doctor who was 29 years old at the time.  Riordan graduated from the [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], spent a year as a consultant and then joined as an associate at Menlo Ventures in 1986. The company traces its roots to a runny nose because Montgomery got a particularly bad cold—a virus—and in his misery he wondered why so few antivirals existed when so many antibiotics were in use.<ref>Forbes Magazine,"The Golden Age of Antivirals",  October 27, 2003 http://www.forbes.com/global/2003/1027/090_print.html</ref> The name of the company was changed to "Gilead Sciences" in 1988 and Montgomery served as the first Chairman of the Board from 1987 to 1993. Riordan looked to [[Donald Rumsfeld]] as a mentor in the business world and to navigate the political waters. Under the technical leadership of scientist Dr. Mark Matteucci, PhD, the company focused on discovery research, making small strands of DNA (oligomers) to assess the potential of genetic code blockers ([[gene therapy]]). Its development of small molecule antiviral therapeutics was ushered in by John Martin in 1992 with the licensing of nucleotide compounds discovered in two European academic labs.

In 1990, Gilead entered into a collaborative research agreement with [[GlaxoSmithKline|Glaxo]] for the research and development of genetic code blockers, also known as [[antisense]]. This collaboration was terminated in 1998, and Gilead's antisense intellectual property portfolio was sold to [[Isis Pharmaceuticals]].

Gilead debuted on the NASDAQ in January 1992. Its IPO raised $86.25 million in proceeds.

In June 1996, Gilead launched its first commercial product, Vistide ([[cidofovir]] injection) for the treatment of [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) [[retinitis]] in patients with [[AIDS]]. The company cooperated with [[Pharmacia & Upjohn]] to market the product outside the United States.

In March 1999, Gilead acquired NeXstar Pharmaceuticals of [[Boulder, Colorado]] following two years of negotiations with the company. At the time, NeXstar's annual sales of $130 million was three times Gilead's sales.  NeXstar's two revenue-generating drugs were AmBisome, an injectable fungal treatment, and DaunoXome, an [[oncology]] drug taken by HIV patients.  Also in 1999, [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]] announced first approval of Tamiflu ([[oseltamivir]]) for the treatment of [[influenza]]. Tamiflu was originally discovered by Gilead and licensed to Roche for late-phase development and marketing. Viread ([[tenofovir]]) achieved first approval in 2001 for the treatment of [[HIV]].

In January 2003, Gilead completed its acquisition of Triangle Pharmaceuticals. The company also announced its first full year of profitability. Later that year Hepsera ([[adefovir]]) was approved for the treatment of chronic [[hepatitis B]], and Emtriva ([[emtricitabine]]) for the treatment of [[HIV]].

In 2004, Gilead launched Truvada, a fixed-dose combination of [[tenofovir]] and [[emtricitabine]].

In January 1997, [[Donald Rumsfeld]], a Board member since 1988, was appointed Chairman of the company.<ref>

In November 2005, George W. Bush urged Congress to pass $7.1 billion in emergency funding to prepare for the possible [[H5N1|bird flu]] pandemic, of which $1 billion is solely dedicated to the purchase, and distribution of Tamiflu.

In July 2006, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved [[Atripla]], a once a day single tablet regimen for HIV, combining Sustiva ([[efavirenz]]), a [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] product, and Truvada ([[emtricitabine]] and [[tenofovir disoproxil fumarate]]), a Gilead product.<ref>{{cite news | last = Pollack | first = Andrew | title = F.D.A.

In 2009 the company received the award for one of the Fastest Growing Companies by ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''. In the same year they were also named as one America's Top Companies to work for by ''[[Forbes]]''. 

On July 16, 2012, The [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved the first drug shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection manufactured by Gilead Sciences. The pill [[Truvada]] as a preventive measure for people who are at high risk of getting HIV through sexual activity.<ref>{{cite web|last=Perrone|first=Matthew|title=FDA approves first pill to help prevent HIV|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/48198452/ns/today-today_health/t/fda-approves-first-pill-help-prevent-hiv/#.UARSd_VdDvY|work=Today Health|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=16 July 2012}}</ref>

===Entry in the cardiovascular and respiratory therapeutic areas===
In 2006, Gilead completed two acquisitions that allowed the company to branch out from its historical antiviral franchise into the [[cardiovascular]] and [[respiratory]] therapeutic arenas.

Myogen,<ref>{{cite press release | title = Gilead Sciences to Acquire Myogen, Inc. for $2.5 Billion | publisher = Gilead Sciences | date = 2006-10-02 | url = http://www.gilead.com/pr_910704 | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref> based in [[Boulder, Colorado]], was completing Phase 3 studies of [[ambrisentan]]—now marketed as "Letairis"—an orally available [[endothelin receptor]] [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]]. The U.S. FDA subsequently approved ambrisentan for the treatment of [[pulmonary hypertension|pulmonary arterial hypertension]] in June 2007.<ref>{{cite news | last = Pollack | first = Andrew | title = Gilead’s Drug Is Approved to Treat a Rare Disease | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = 2007-06-16 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/16/business/16gilead.html | accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release | title = U.S. Food and Drug Administration Approves Gilead's Letairis Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension | publisher = Gilead Sciences | date = 2007-06-15 | url = http://www.gilead.com/wt/sec/pr_1016053 | accessdate = 2007-06-16 }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release | title = FDA Approves New Orphan Drug for Treatment of Pulmonary arterial hypertension | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration]] | date = 2007-06-15

Under an agreement with [[GlaxoSmithKline]], Myogen marketed [[Flolan]] ([[epoprostenol sodium]]) in the United States  for the treatment of [[primary pulmonary hypertension]]. Additionally, Myogen was developing (in Phase 3 studies) darusentan,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/search?term=darusentan&submit=Search |title=ClinicalTrials.gov - Information on Clinical Trials and Human Research Studies: Darusentan |accessdate=2007-08-18}}</ref> also an endothelin receptor antagonist, for the potential treatment of resistant [[hypertension]].

The other acquisition was Corus Pharma. Corus's lead product candidate, aztreonam lysine for inhalation, is an antibiotic with activity against [[gram-negative bacteria]] including [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]], which can cause lung infections in patients with [[cystic fibrosis]]. The product is in Phase 3 studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00499720 |title=Clinical Trial: Aztreonam Lysine for Inhalation in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis and Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Airway Infection |accessdate=2007-08-18}}</ref> Gilead also obtained an inhalation formulation of two antibiotics for treatment of respiratory infections.<ref>{{cite press release | title = Gilead Invests $25 Million in Corus Pharma; Establishes Equity Position in Company With Late-Stage Product Candidate for Cystic Fibrosis | publisher = Gilead Sciences | date = 2006-04-12 | url = http://www.gilead.com/pr_842319 | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref>

Gilead expanded its move into respiratory therapeutics in 2007 by entering into a licensing agreement with Parion for an [[epithelial sodium channel]] inhibitor for the treatment of pulmonary diseases, including cystic fibrosis, [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] and [[bronchiectasis]].<ref>{{cite press release | title = Parion Sciences and Gilead Sciences Sign Agreement to Advance Drug Candidates for Pulmonary Disease | publisher = Gilead Sciences | date = 2007-08-15 | url = http://www.gilead.com/pr_1040975 | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref>

In 2009, Gilead acquired CV Therapeutics. This acquisition brought [[Ranexa]] and [[Lexiscan]] as commercial products. Ranexa is a cardiovascular drug used to treat chronic [[angina]] (chest pain related to coronary artery disease).

Current Gilead Sciences CEO is John C. Martin. Martin's 2010 compensation was $42.72 million and his five-year total is $204.24 million or $31,912 per hour. [http://chiefexecutive.net/americas-highest-paid-ceos]
