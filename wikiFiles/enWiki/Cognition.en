In [[science]], '''cognition''' is a group of [[mind|mental]] processes that includes [[attention]], [[memory]], producing and understanding [[language]], [[learning]], [[Reason|reasoning]], [[problem solving]], and [[decision making]]. Various disciplines, such as psychology, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science all study cognition. However, the term's usage varies across disciplines; for example, in [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], "cognition" usually refers to an [[information processing]] view of an individual's psychological [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functions]]. It is also used in a branch of [[social psychology]] called [[social cognition]] to explain [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]], and groups dynamics.<ref>Sternberg, R. J., & Sternberg, K. (2009). Cognitive psychology (6th Ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.</ref> In cognitive psychology and cognitive engineering, cognition is typically assumed to be information processing in a participant’s or operator’s mind or brain.<ref name="Blomberg">Blomberg, O. (2011). Concepts of cognition for cognitive engineering. The international journal of aviation psychology, 21(1), 85-104. doi: 10.1080/10508414.2011.537561</ref>

Cognition is a faculty for the processing of [[information]], applying knowledge, and changing preferences. Cognition, or cognitive processes, can be natural or artificial, conscious or unconscious. These processes are analyzed from different perspectives within different contexts, notably in the fields of [[linguistics]], [[anesthesia]], [[neurology]] and [[psychiatry]], [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], [[systemics]], and [[computer science]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Von Eckardt|first=Barbara|title=What is cognitive science?|year=1996|publisher=MIT Press|location=Massachusetts|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=E8l48-DZln0C&oi=fnd&pg=PA13&dq=what+is+cognition&ots=XiSitl9qae&sig=DQ8AKrgLAtO1BfwyQRYyo9ZeDaI#v=onepage&q=what%20is%20cognition&f=false}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=December 2012}} Within psychology or philosophy, the concept of cognition is closely related to abstract [[concept]]s such as [[mind]], [[intelligence]]. It encompasses the [[mental function]]s, [[thought|mental processes]] ([[thought]]s), and states of [[intelligence|intelligent]] entities ([[human]]s, collaborative groups, human organizations, highly autonomous machines, and [[artificial intelligence]]s).<ref name="Blomberg" />

==Etymology==
The word cognition comes from the [[Latin]] verb ''cognosco'' ('''con''' 'with' + '''gnōscō''' 'know'), itself a cognate of the Ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] verb '''gnόsko''' "γνώσκω" meaning 'I know' (noun: ''gnόsis'' "γνώσις" = knowledge), so broadly, 'to conceptualize' or 'to recognize'.

==Origins of Cognition==

Attention to the cognitive process came about more than twenty-three centuries ago, beginning with Aristotle and his interest in the inner-workings of the mind and how they affect the human experience. Aristotle focused on cognitive areas pertaining to memory, perception, and mental imagery. The Greek philosopher found great importance in ensuring that his studies were based on empirical evidence; scientific information that is gathered through thorough observation and conscientious experimentation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Matlin|first=Margaret|title=Cognition|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, NJ|page=4}}</ref> Centuries later, as psychology became a blooming study in Europe and then gaining a following in America, other scientists like Wilhelm Wundt, Herman Ebbinghaus, Mary Whiton Calkins, and William James, to name a few, would offer their contributions to the study of cognition.

'''Wilhelm Wundt''' (1832-1920) heavily emphasized the notion of what he called introspection; examining the inner feelings of an individual. With introspection, the subject had to be careful to describe their feelings in the most objective manner possible in order for Wundt to find the information scientific.<ref name="Fuchs">{{cite journal|last=Fuchs|first=A. H.|coauthors=Milar, K.J.|title=Psychology as a science|journal=Handbook of psychology|year=2003|volume=1|issue=The history of psychology|pages=1-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Zangwill|first=O. L.|title=The Oxford companion to the mind|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=951-952}}</ref> Though Wundt's contributions are by no means minimal, modern psychologists find his methods to be quite subjective, and choose to rely on more objective procedures of experimentations to make conclusions about the human cognitive process.

'''Herman Ebbinghaus''' (1850-1909) conducted cognitive studies mainly examined the function and capacity of human memory.
Ebbinghaus developed his own experiment in which he constructed over 2,000 syllables made out of nonexistent words, for instance EAS. He would then examine his own personal ability to learn these non words. He purposely chose non words as opposed to real words to control for the influence of pre-existing experience with what the words may symbolize, thus enabling easier recollection of them.<ref name=Fuchs /><ref name= "Zangwill">{{cite book|last=Zangwill|first=O.L.|title=The Oxford companion to the mind|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=276}}</ref> Ebbinghaus observed and hypothesized a number of variables that may have affected his ability to learn and recall the non words he created. One of the reasons he concluded was the amount of time between the presentation of the list of stimuli. His work heavily influenced the study of serial position and its affect on memory, discussed in subsequent sections.

'''Mary Whiton Calkins''' (1863-1930) was an influential American female pioneer in the realm of psychology. Her work also focused on the human memory capacity. A common theory, called the Recency effect, can be attributed to the studies that she conducted.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Madigan|first=S.|coauthors=O'Hara, R.|title=Short-term memory at the turn of the century: Mary Whiton Calkin's memory research|journal=American Psychologist|year=1992|volume=47|page=170-174}}</ref> The recency effect, also discussed in the subsequent experiment section, is the tendency for individuals to be able to accurately recollect the final items presented in a sequence of stimuli. Her theory is closely related to the aforementioned study and conclusion of the memory experiments conducted by Herman Ebbinghaus.<ref name="Matlin">{{cite book|last=Matlin|first=Margaret|title=Cognition|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, NJ|page=5}}</ref>

'''William James''' (1842-1910) is another pivotal figure in the history of cognitive science. James was quite discontent with Wundt's emphasis on introspection and Ebbinghaus' use of nonsense stimuli. He instead chose to focus on the human learning experience in everyday life and its importance to the study of cognition. James' major contribution was his textbook ''Principles of Psychology'' that preliminarily examines many aspects of cognition like perception, memory, reasoning, and attention to name a few.<ref name=Matlin />

==Psychology==
[[File:Generalization process using trees PNG version.png|thumb|right|alt=Diagram|When the mind makes a generalization such as the [[concept]] of ''tree'', it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables higher-level thinking.]]
The sort of mental processes described as ''cognitive'' are largely influenced by research which has successfully used this paradigm in the past, likely starting with [[Thomas Aquinas]], who divided the study of behavior into two broad categories: cognitive (how we know the world), and [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] (how we understand the world via feelings and emotions). Consequently, this description tends to apply to processes such as [[memory]], [[Association of Ideas|association]], [[concept formation]], [[pattern recognition]], [[language]], [[attention]], [[perception]], [[action (philosophy)|action]], [[problem solving]] and [[mental images|mental imagery]].<ref>''Sensation & Perception'', 5th ed. 1999, Coren, Ward & Enns, p. 9</ref><ref>''Cognitive Psychology'', 5th ed. 1999, Best, John B., p. 15-17</ref> Traditionally, [[emotion]] was not thought of as a cognitive process. This division is now regarded as largely artificial, and much research is currently being undertaken to examine the [[cognitive psychology]] of emotion; research also includes one's awareness of one's own strategies and methods of cognition called  [[metacognition]] and includes [[metamemory]].

Empirical research into cognition is usually scientific and quantitative, or involves creating models to describe or explain certain behaviors. 

While few people would deny that cognitive processes are a function of the [[brain]], a cognitive theory will not necessarily make reference to the brain or other biological process (compare [[neurocognitive]]). It may purely describe behavior in terms of information flow or function. Relatively recent fields of study such as [[cognitive science]] and [[neuropsychology]] aim to bridge this gap, using cognitive paradigms to understand how the brain implements these information-processing functions (see also [[cognitive neuroscience]]), or how pure information-processing systems (e.g., computers) can simulate cognition (see also [[artificial intelligence]]). The branch of psychology that studies brain injury to infer normal cognitive function is called [[cognitive neuropsychology]]. The links of cognition to [[evolution]]ary demands are studied through the investigation of [[animal cognition]]. And conversely, evolutionary-based perspectives can inform hypotheses about cognitive functional systems' [[evolutionary psychology]]. 

The theoretical school of thought derived from the cognitive approach is often called [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]]. 

The phenomenal success of the cognitive approach can be seen by its current dominance as the core model in contemporary psychology (usurping [[behaviorism]] in the late 1950s).
Cognition is severely damaged in dementia.

==Social process==
<!--This section is linked from [[Second language]]-->
For every individual, the social context in which he's embedded provides the symbols of his representation and linguistic expression. The human society sets the environment where the newborn will be socialized and develop his cognition. For example, [[face perception]] in human babies emerges by the age of two months: young children at a playground or swimming pool develop their social recognition by being exposed to multiple faces and associating the experiences to those faces. [[Education]] has the explicit task in [[society]] of developing cognition. Choices are made regarding the [[social environment|environment]] and permitted [[action (philosophy)|action]] that lead to a formed [[experience]]. 

Language acquisition is an example of an [[emergent behavior]]. From a large systemic perspective, cognition is considered closely related to the social and human organization [[social function|functioning]] and constrains. For example, the macro-choices made by the teachers influence the micro-choices made by students..

==Piaget's theory of cognitive development==

For years, sociologists and psychologists have conducted studies on [[cognitive development]] or the construction of human thought or mental processes.

[[Jean Piaget]] was one of the most important and influential people in the field of Developmental Psychology. He believed that humans are unique in comparison to animals because we have the capacity to do "abstract symbolic reasoning." His work can be compared to Lev Vygotsky, Sigmund Freud, and [[Erik Erikson]] who were also great contributors in the field of Developmental Psychology. Today, Piaget is known for studying the cognitive development in children.  He studied his own three children and their intellectual development and came up with a theory that describes the stages children pass through during development. <ref>{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=Jean Piaget Biography|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/profilesofmajorthinkers/p/piaget.htm|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=18 September 2012}}</ref> 

Piaget's theory of developmental psychology tackled cognitive development from infancy to adulthood.

==Common Cognitive Experiments==
'''Serial Position'''

The serial position experiment is meant to test a theory of memory that states that when information is given in a serial manner, we tend to remember information in the beginning of the sequence, called the primacy effect, and information in the end of the sequence, called the recency effect. Consequently, information given in the middle of the sequence is typically forgotten, or not recalled as easily. This study predicts that the recency effect is stronger than the primacy effect because the information that is most recently learned is still in working memory when asked to be recalled. On the other hand, information that is learned first still has to go through a retrieval process. This experiment focuses on human memory processes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Surprenant|first=A|title=Distinctiveness and serial position effects in total sequences|journal=Perception and Psychophysics|year=2001|volume=63|page=737-745}}</ref> 

'''Word Superiority'''

The word superiority experiment presents a subject with a word or a letter by itself for a brief period of time, i.e. 40ms, and they are then asked to recall the letter that was in a particular location in the word. By theory, the subject should be able to correctly recall the letter when it was presented in a word than when it was presented in isolation. This experiment focuses on human speech and language.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Krueger|first=L.|title=The word-superiority effect and phonological recoding|journal=Memory & Cognition|year=1992|volume=20|page=685-694}}</ref> 

'''Brown-Peterson'''

In the Brown-Peterson experiment, participants are briefly presented with a trigram and in one particular version of the experiment,  they are then given a distractor task asking them to identify whether a sequence of words are in fact words, or non-words (due to being misspelled, etc.). After the distractor task, they are asked to recall the trigram which they were presented with before the distractor task. In theory, the longer the distractor task, the harder it will be for participants to correctly recall the trigram. This experiment focuses on human short-term memory.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nairne|first=J.|coauthors=Whiteman, H., & Kelley, M.|title=Short-term forgetting of order under conditions of reduced interference|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology A: Human Experimental Psychology|year=1999|volume=52|page=241-251}}</ref> 

'''Memory Span'''

During the memory span experiment, each subject is presented with a sequence of stimuli of the same kind; words depicting objects, numbers, letters that sound similar, and letters that sound dissimilar. After being presented with the stimuli, the subject is asked to recall the sequence of stimuli that they were given in the exact order in which they were given it. In one particular version of the experiment, if the subject recalled a list correctly, the list length increased by one for that type of material, and vice versa if it was recalled incorrectly. The theory is that people have a memory span of about seven items for numbers, the same for letters that sound dissimilar and short words. The memory span is projected to be shorter with letters that sound similar and longer words.<ref>{{cite journal|last=May|first=C.|coauthors=Hasher, L., & Kane, M.|title=The role of interference in memory span|journal=Memory & Cognition|year=1999|volume=27|pages=759-767}}</ref> 

'''Visual Search'''

In one version of the visual search experiment, participants are presented with a window that displayed circles and squares scattered across it. The participant is to identify whether there is a green circle on the window. In the "featured" search, the subject is presented with several trial windows that have blue squares or circles and one green circle or no green circle in it at all. In the "conjunctive" search, the subject is presented with trial windows that have blue circles or green squares and a present or absent green circle whose presence the participant is asked to identify. What is expected is that in the feature searches, reaction time, that is the time it takes for a participant to identify whether a green circle is present or not, should not change as the number of distractors increases. Conjunctive searches where the target is absent should have a longer reaction time than the conjunctive searches where the target is present. The theory is that in feature searches, it is easy to spot the target or if it is absent because of the difference in color between the target and the distractors. In conjunctive searches where the target is absent, reaction time increases because the subject has to look at each shape to determine whether it is the target or not because some of the distractors if not all of them, are the same color as the target stimuli. Conjunctive searches where the target is present take less time because if the target is found, the search between each shape, stops.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=J.|coauthors=Cave, K. & Franzel, S.|title=Guided search: An alternative to the feature integration model for visual search|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1989|volume=15|pages=419-433}}</ref>

'''Knowledge Representation'''

The [[semantic network]] of [[knowledge representation]] systems has been studied in various paradigms.  One of the oldest is the [[leveling]] and [[sharpening]] of stories as they are repeated from memory studied by [[Frederic Bartlett|Bartlett]]. The [[semantic differential]] used [[factor analysis]] to determine the main meanings of words, finding that [[value (ethics)|value]] or "goodness" of words is the first factor.  More controlled experiments examine the categorical relationships of words in [[free recall]].  The hierarchical structure of words has been explicitly mapped in [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]]'s [[Wordnet]].  More dynamic models of semantic networks have been created and tested with [[neural network]] experiments based on computational systems such as [[latent semantic analysis]] (LSA), [[Thomas Bayes|Bayesian]] analysis, and multidimensional [[factor analysis]].  The semantics (meaning) of words is studied by all the disciplines of [[cognitive science]].
