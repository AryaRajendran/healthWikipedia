A '''high dependency unit''' is an area in a [[hospital]], usually located closely to the [[intensive care unit]], where patients can be cared for more extensively than on a normal ward, but not to the point of intensive care. Many of these units were set up in the 1990s when hospitals found that a proportion of patients was requiring a level of care that could not be delivered in a normal ward setting.<ref name=Griffiths2007>{{cite journal |author=Griffiths MJ, Evans TW |title=The pulmonary physician in critical care: towards comprehensive critical care? |journal=Thorax |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=77–8 |year=2002 |month=January |pmid=11809995 |pmc=1746189 |doi=10.1136/thorax.57.1.77 |url=http://thorax.bmj.com/content/57/1/77.long}}</ref> This is thought to be associated with a reduction in mortality.<ref name=Griffiths2007/> Patients may be admitted to an HDU bed because they are at risk of requiring intensive care admission, or as a step-down between intensive care and ward-based care.<ref name=Griffiths2007/>

In 2000 the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|UK Department of Health]] issued the report "Comprehensive Critical Care", which set out the number of high dependency ("level 2") beds a hospital should have to deliver care appropriately. By this time, two thirds of UK hospitals had beds identified as "high dependency".<ref name=DOH2000>{{cite book| author=Day V, Adam S, Asbridge J ''et al'' | title=Comprehensive critical care: review of adult critical care services | publisher=Department of Health | location=London | year=2000 | url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_4082872.pdf}}</ref> The report defines level 2 care as "more detailed observations or intervention including support for a single failing organ system or postoperative care and those 'stepping down' from higher levels of care".<ref name=DOH2000/>

If [[positive airway pressure]] ventilation is used to treat [[respiratory failure]], this may be administered in a high dependency unit or equivalent area.<ref name=Griffiths2007/><ref name=Nava2009>{{cite journal |author=Nava S, Hill N |title=Non-invasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure |journal=Lancet |volume=374 |issue=9685 |pages=250–9 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19616722 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60496-7}}</ref>
