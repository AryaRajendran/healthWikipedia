An '''anaesthetic technician''' ([[British English]]) or '''anesthesia technician''' ([[US English]]) is an allied [[health care provider|healthcare worker]] who assists with the administration and monitoring of anaesthesia and has an extensive knowledge of anaesthesia techniques, instruments, supplies, and technology.

Anaesthetic technicians are mainly employed by [[anaesthetic]] departments or [[operating theatre]] suites, but can be found in other areas of clinical practice including [[emergency department]]s, [[intensive care unit]]s (ICU) and [[day surgery]] clinics.

== Role description ==

Anaesthetic technicians are involved with all aspects of the delivery of a patient's perioperative anaesthetic care,<ref>NZATS Scope of Practice</ref> taking into account the patients' religious and cultural beliefs and respecting their right to [[medical privacy]] and dignity at all times.

=== Prior to anaesthesia ===

Anaesthetic technicians prepare equipment needed for the patient to safely undergo [[anaesthesia]]. This involves:
* checking and setting up the [[anaesthetic machine]]
* preparing [[intravenous]] drugs
* preparing [[intravenous therapy]] administration equipment
* preparing a range of devices to maintain the patient's airway (e.g. [[laryngeal masks]], endotracheal tube)
* communicating with the patient when they arrive into the operating theatre
* establish peripheral intravenous access.
* applying [[anaesthetic monitoring]] to help assess the patients' condition whilst under [[anaesthesia]].  This may include [[electrocardiography]] (ECG), [[blood pressure]] and [[oxygen saturation]] devices.  The monitoring of other parameters such as anaesthesia depth monitors (EEG, [[bispectral index]] etc.) may also be necessary.

===During anaesthesia===
The anaesthetic technicians role includes assisting with:
* inducing and maintaining adequate anaesthesia.
* establishing and securing an airway.
* making sure that patients are positioned in such a way NOT to cause discomfort or injury during their procedure.
* monitoring patients' [[vital signs]] and anaesthesia depth.
* temperature monitoring and regulation.
* collection and analysis of patient ([[blood]]) samples.
* acquiring transfusion fluids and equipment.

===After anaesthesia===
Anaesthetic technicians assist the [[anaesthetist]] with:
* waking the patient.
* removing airway devices.
* transferring patients to post-operative care units

===Other activities===
Regional variations exist, but anaesthetic technicians may also be involved with:
* [[Intra-aortic balloon pump|Intra-operative intra-aortic balloon pump setup, operating and monitoring]].
* [[Pulmonary artery catheter|Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheter insertion and monitoring]].
* [[Intraoperative blood salvage|Intra-operative blood salvage setup, operating and monitoring]].
