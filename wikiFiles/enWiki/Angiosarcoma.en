'''Angiosarcoma''' is a malignant [[neoplasm]] (cancer) of endothelial-type cells that line vessel walls. This may be in reference to blood ([[hemangiosarcoma]]) or lymphatic vessels ([[lymphangiosarcoma]]).

Its origin typically readily permits metastases to distant sites. Most tumors of visceral blood and lymphatic vessel walls are malignant. Hemangiosarcomas and lymphangiosarcomas of the skin are not common. {{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Angiosarcoma of the liver, a rare fatal tumor, has been seen in workers intensively exposed to the gas [[vinyl chloride monomer]] (VCM) for prolonged periods while working in [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) polymerization plants. It has also been associated with individuals exposed to arsenic-containing insecticides and [[Thorotrast]]. In canines, however, angiosarcoma is relatively common, especially in larger breeds such as golden retrievers and labrador retrievers.
