'''Noise pollution''' is displeasing or excessive [[noise]] that may disrupt the activity or balance of human or animal life. The word ''[[noise]]'' is cognate with the Latin word ''[[nausea]]s'', which means disgust or discomfort.<ref>noise. Dictionary.com. Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/noise (accessed: March 04, 2012).</ref> The source of most outdoor noise worldwide is mainly caused by [[machines]] and [[Transport|transportation systems]], [[motor vehicle]]s, [[aircraft]]s, and [[trains]].<ref name="Senate">Senate Public Works Committee, Noise Pollution and Abatement Act of 1972, S. Rep. No. 1160, 92nd Cong. 2nd session</ref><ref>C. Michael Hogan and Gary L. Latshaw, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/2930880 "The relationship between highway planning and urban noise"], Proceedings of the ASCE, Urban Transportation, May 21-23, 1973, Chicago, Illinois. By American Society of Civil Engineers. Urban Transportation Division</ref> Outdoor noise is summarized by the word [[environmental noise]]. Poor [[urban planning]] may give rise to noise pollution, since side-by-side industrial and residential buildings can result in noise pollution in the residential areas.

Indoor noise is caused by machines, building activities, music performances, and especially in some workplaces. There is no great difference whether [[noise-induced hearing loss]] is brought about by outside (e.g. trains) or inside (e.g. music) noise.

High noise levels can contribute to cardiovascular effects in humans, a rise in blood pressure, and an increase in stress and vasoconstriction, and an increased incidence of coronary artery disease. In animals, noise can increase the risk of death by altering predator or prey detection and avoidance, interfere with reproduction and navigation, and contribute to permanent hearing loss.

{{Main|Health effects from noise}}
Noise pollution affects both health and behavior. Unwanted sound (noise) can damage psychological health. Noise pollution can cause annoyance and aggression, [[hypertension]], high stress levels, [[tinnitus]], hearing loss, sleep disturbances, and other harmful effects.<ref name="Rosen">S. Rosen and P. Olin, ''Hearing Loss and Coronary Heart Disease'', Archives of Otolaryngology, 82:236 (1965)</ref><ref name="Field">J.M. Field, ''Effect of personal and situational variables upon noise annoyance in residential areas'', Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 93: 2753-2763 (1993)</ref><ref>

Furthermore, stress and hypertension are the leading causes to health problems.<ref name="Field" /><ref>Karl D. Kryter, ''The Effects of Noise on Man '', Academic Press (1985)</ref>

Chronic exposure to noise may cause [[noise-induced hearing loss]]. Older males exposed to significant [[Industrial noise|occupational noise]] demonstrate [[Statistical significance|significantly]] reduced hearing sensitivity than their non-exposed peers, though differences in hearing sensitivity decrease with time and the two groups are indistinguishable by age 79.<ref name = Rosenhall1990>{{cite journal |author=Rosenhall U, Pedersen K, Svanborg A |title=Presbycusis and noise-induced hearing loss |journal=Ear Hear |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=257–63 |year=1990 |pmid=2210099| doi = 10.1097/00003446-199008000-00002}}</ref> A comparison of [[Maaban]] [[tribesmen]], who were insignificantly exposed to transportation or industrial noise, to a typical U.S. population showed that chronic exposure to moderately high levels of environmental noise contributes to hearing loss.<ref name="Rosen" />

High noise levels can contribute to [[cardiovascular]] effects and exposure to moderately high levels during a single eight-hour period causes a statistical rise in [[blood pressure]] of five to ten points and an increase in [[stress (medicine)|stress]],<ref name="Rosen"/> and [[vasoconstriction]] leading to the [[hypertension|increased blood pressure]] noted above, as well as to increased incidence of [[coronary artery disease]].

Noise pollution also is a cause of annoyance. A 2005 study by Spanish researchers found that in urban areas households are willing to pay approximately four [[Euro]]s per decibel per year for noise reduction.<ref>Jesús Barreiro, Mercedes Sánchez, Montserrat Viladrich-Grau (2005), "How much are people willing to pay for silence? A contingent valuation study", ''Applied Economics'', 37 (11)</ref>

===Wildlife===
Noise can have a detrimental effect on wild animals, increasing the risk of death by changing the delicate balance in predator or prey detection and avoidance, and  interfering the use of the sounds in communication, especially in relation to reproduction and in navigation. Acoustic overexposure can lead to temporary or permanent loss of hearing.

An impact of noise on wild animal life is the [[Habitat destruction|reduction of usable habitat]] that noisy areas may cause, which in the case of endangered species may be part of the path to [[extinction]]. Noise pollution has caused the death of certain species of whales that [[beached whale|beached]] themselves after being exposed to the loud sound of military [[sonar]],<ref>[http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/acoustics/bahamas_stranding.pdf Bahamas Marine Mammal Stranding Event of 15–16 March 2000]</ref> (see also [[Marine mammals and sonar]]).

Noise also makes species communicate more loudly, which is called [[Lombard effect|Lombard vocal response]].<ref>www.dosits.org/glossary/pop/lvr.htm</ref> Scientists and researchers have conducted experiments that show whales' song length is longer when submarine-detectors are on.<ref>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ASAJ..113.3411F Variation in humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) song length in relation to low-frequency sound broadcasts]</ref> If creatures do not "speak" loudly enough, their voice will be [[Sound masking|masked]] by [[anthropogenic]] sounds. These unheard voices might be warnings, finding of prey, or preparations of net-bubbling. When one species begins speaking more loudly, it will mask other species' voice, causing the whole ecosystem eventually to speak more loudly.

Marine invertebrates, such as crabs (''[[Carcinus maenas]]''), have also been shown to be impacted by ship noise.<ref name=DeepSNcrabs>{{cite web |author=McClain, Craig |title=Loud Noise Makes Crabs Even More Crabby |publisher=Deep Sea News |url=http://deepseanews.com/2013/04/load-noise-makes-crabs-edgy/ |accessdate=2013-04-04 }}</ref><ref name="WaleSimpson2013">{{cite journal|last1=Wale|first1=M.

Repeated exposure to the sounds did lead to [[acclimatization]].<ref name="WaleSimpson2013"/>

[[European Robins]] living in urban environments are more likely to sing at night in places with high levels of noise pollution during the day, suggesting that they sing at night because it is quieter, and their message can propagate through the environment more clearly.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fuller RA, Warren PH, Gaston KJ |year=2007|title=Daytime noise predicts nocturnal singing in urban robins |journal=Biology Letters |volume=3 |pages=368–70 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2007.0134 |pmid=17456449 |issue=4 |pmc=2390663}}</ref> The same study showed that daytime noise was a stronger predictor of nocturnal singing than night-time [[light pollution]], to which the phenomenon often is attributed.

[[Zebra finch]]es become less faithful to their partners when exposed to traffic noise. This could alter a population's evolutionary trajectory by selecting traits, sapping resources normally devoted to other activities and thus leading to profound genetic and evolutionary consequences.<ref>Milius, S. (2007). High Volume, Low Fidelity: Birds are less faithful as sounds blare, ''Science News'' vol. 172, p. 116. ([http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20070825/fob3ref.asp references])</ref>

==Impact in the United Kingdom==
Figures compiled by Rockwool, the [[mineral wool]] [[Building insulation|insulation]] manufacturer, based on responses from local authorities to a [[Freedom of Information Act]] (FOI) request reveal in the period April 2008 – 2009 [[county council|UK councils]] received 315,838 complaints about noise pollution from private residences. This resulted in environmental health officers across the UK serving 8,069 [[noise abatement]] notices, or citations under the terms of the Anti-Social Behaviour (Scotland) Act. In the last 12 months, 524 confiscations of equipment have been authorised involving the removal of powerful speakers, stereos and televisions. [[Westminster City Council]] has received more complaints per head of population than any other district in the UK with 9,814 grievances about noise, which equates to 42.32 complaints per thousand residents. Eight of the top 10 councils ranked by complaints per 1,000 residents are located in [[London]].<ref>

==Mitigation==
[[Image:TullamarineFwy.jpg|thumb|The ''[[CityLink#New freeways|sound tube]]'' in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] is designed to reduce [[roadway noise]] without distracting from the area's aesthetics]]

{{Main|Noise mitigation}}

[[Roadway noise]] can be reduced by the use of [[noise barrier]]s, limitation of vehicle speeds, alteration of roadway surface texture, limitation of [[heavy vehicle]]s, use of traffic controls that smooth vehicle flow to reduce braking and acceleration, and tire design. An important factor in applying these strategies is a [[computer model]] for [[roadway noise]], that is capable of addressing local [[topography]], [[meteorology]], traffic operations, and hypothetical mitigation. Costs of building-in mitigation can be modest, provided these solutions are sought in the planning stage of a roadway project.

[[Aircraft noise]] can be reduced by using quieter [[jet engine]]s. Altering [[flight path]]s and time of day runway has benefitted residents near airports.

[[Industrial noise]] has been addressed since the 1930s via redesign of industrial equipment, shock mounted assemblies and physical barriers in the workplace.

==Legal status==
{{Main|Noise regulation}}

Up until the 1970s governments viewed noise as a "nuisance" rather than an environmental problem. In the [[United States]], there are federal standards for highway and aircraft noise; states and local governments typically have very specific statutes on [[building codes]], [[urban planning]], and roadway development.

Noise laws and ordinances vary widely among municipalities and indeed do not even exist in some cities. An ordinance may contain a general prohibition against making noise that is a nuisance, or it may set out specific guidelines for the level of noise allowable at certain times of the day and for certain activities.

[[Portland, Oregon]] instituted the first comprehensive noise code in 1975 with funding from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] (Environmental Protection Agency) and HUD (Housing and Urban Development). The Portland Noise Code includes potential fines of up to $5000 per infraction and is the basis for other major U.S. and Canadian city noise ordinances.<ref>City of Portland, Oregon. Auditor's Office.

Many conflicts over noise pollution are handled by negotiation between the emitter and the receiver. Escalation procedures vary by country, and may include action in conjunction with local authorities, in particular the police.

Noise pollution is a major problem in countries such as India during the festivals of [[Diwali]], [[Navaratri]], and [[Ganpati]]. The government of India has regulations against firecrackers and loudspeakers, but enforcement is extremely lax.<ref>[http://cpcb.nic.in/faq1.php Govt of India: Central Pollution Control Board FAQs]</ref> [[Awaaz Foundation]] is an Indian NGO working to control noise pollution from various sources in Mumbai through advocacy, public interest litigation, awareness, and educational campaigns since 2003.<ref>[http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Rising-festival-noise-undoing-past-efforts/Article1-939539.aspx Rising festival noise undoing past efforts']</ref>
