'''Adenoid cystic carcinoma''' (AdCC) is a rare type of [[cancer]] that can exist in many different body sites.  It most often occurs in the areas of the head and neck, in particular the [[salivary gland]]s; but has also been reported in the [[breast]], [[lacrimal gland]] of the [[human eye|eye]], [[human lung|lung]], [[human brain|brain]], [[bartholin gland]], [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], and the [[paranasal sinuses]].  It is  sometimes referred to as adenocyst, malignant cylindroma, adenocystic, adenoidcystic, ACC, AdCC.

It is the third most common malignant salivary gland tumor overall (after [[mucoepidermoid carcinoma]] and [[polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma]]).  It represents 28% of malignant submandibular gland tumors, making it the single most common malignant salivary gland tumor in this region.  Patients may survive for years with metastases because this tumor is generally well-differentiated and slow growing. In a 1999 study<ref>Fordice, J. " Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the head and neck - Predictors of morbidity and mortality." <em>Archives of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery</em> 125:2 (February, 1999) pp. 149-152 [http://archotol.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/125/2/149]</ref> of a cohort of 160 ACC patients, disease specific survival was 89% at 5 years but only 40% at 15 years,<ref>Christopher Moskaluk, MD, PhD, and Henry F. Frierson, Jr., MD. "Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma." [http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/cancer/teampages/moskaluk/ACChome.cfm]</ref> reflecting deaths from late-occurring metastatic disease.

==Treatment==

Primary treatment for this cancer, regardless of body site, is surgical removal with clean margins.  This surgery can prove challenging in the head and neck region due to this tumour's tendency spread along nerve tracts.  [[Adjuvant]] or [[palliative]] [[radiotherapy]] is commonly given following surgery. For advanced major and minor salivary gland tumors that are inoperable, recurrent, or exhibit gross residual disease after surgery, [[fast neutron therapy]] is widely regarded as the most effective form of treatment.<ref>Laramore GE. "Fast neutron radiotherapy for inoperable salivary gland tumors: is it the treatment of choice?"

[[Chemotherapy]] is used for [[metastatic]] disease.  Chemotherapy is considered on a case by case basis, as there is limited trial data on the positive effects of chemotherapy.  Clinical studies are ongoing, however.
