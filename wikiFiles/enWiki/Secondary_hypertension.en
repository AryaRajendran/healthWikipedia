'''Secondary hypertension''' (or, less commonly, '''inessential hypertension''') is a type of [[hypertension]] which by definition is caused by an identifiable underlying secondary cause. It is much less common than the other type, called [[essential hypertension]], affecting only 5% of hypertensive patients. It has many different causes including [[endocrine diseases]], [[kidney diseases]], and [[tumors]]. It also can be a [[Adverse effect|side effect]] of many [[medications]].

==Types==
===Renovascular hypertension (I15.0)===
It has two main causes: fibromuscular dysplasia and atheromatous stenosis.
* ''See main article at [[Renovascular hypertension]].''

===Hypertension secondary to other renal disorders (I15.1)===
*[[Chronic renal failure]]
*[[Kidney disease]] / [[renal artery stenosis]]: the normal physiological response to low blood pressure in the renal arteries is to increase cardiac output (CO) to maintain the pressure needed for [[glomerulus (kidney)|glomerular filtration]]. Here, however, increased CO cannot solve the structural problems causing renal artery hypotension, with the result that CO remains chronically elevated.
*[[Renal segmental hypoplasia]] (Ask-Upmark kidney)

===Hypertension secondary to endocrine disorders (I15.2)===
*Neurogenic hypertension - excessive secretion of norepinephrine and epinephrine which promotes vasoconstriction resulting from chronic high activity of the [[Autonomic nervous system|sympathoadrenal system]], the [[sympathetic nervous system]] and the [[adrenal gland]]. The specific mechanism involved is increased release of the "stress hormones", [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) and [[norepinephrine]] which increase blood output from the heart and constrict arteries. People with neurogenic hypertension respond poorly to treatment with diuretics as the underlying cause of their hypertension is not addressed.<ref name=NYP101303>{{cite web|title=NewYork Weill Cornell Research Highlights Need To Focus on Frequently Neglected Neurogenic Hypertension: Closer Analysis Can Pinpoint True Cause of Hypertension and Direct Successful Management: Not All Hypertension Should Be Treated with the Same Drug|url=http://nyp.org/news/hospital/mann-neurogenic-hypertension.html|publisher=The New York Weill Cornell Medical Center|author=Office of Public Affairs|accessdate=29 January 2013|format=news|date=13 Oct 2003|quote=In this form of "neurogenic" hypertension, blood pressure elevation is caused by increases in cardiac output and constriction of systemic arteries due to increased epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine production—the so-called "stress" hormones.}}</ref><ref name=AJH1003>{{cite journal|title=Neurogenic essential hypertension revisited: the case for increased clinical and research attention|journal=American Journal of Hypertension  Volume 16,|year=2003|month=October|volume=16|issue=10|pages=881–888|doi=10.1016/S0895-7061(03)00978-6|url=http://ajh.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/10/881.abstract|accessdate=29 January 2013|author=Samuel J Mann|quote=Abstract Free, Full Text (HTML) Free, Full Text (PDF) Free}}</ref>
**[[Pheochromocytoma]] - a tumor which results in an excessive secretion of norepinephrine and epinephrine which promotes vasoconstriction
*[[Hyperaldosteronism]] ([[Conn's syndrome]]) - idiopathic hyperaldosteronism, liddle's syndrome (also called pseudoaldosteronism), glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism
*[[Cushing's syndrome]] - an excessive secretion of glucocorticoids causes the hypertension
*[[Hyperparathyroidism]]
*[[Acromegaly]]
*[[Hyperthyroidism]]
*[[Hypothyroidism]]

===Other secondary hypertension (I15.8)===
*[[Hormonal contraceptives]]
*[[Neurologic disorder]]s
*[[Obstructive sleep apnea]]
*[[Liquorice]] (when consumed in excessive amounts)
*[[Scleroderma]]
*[[Neurofibromatosis]]
* [[Pregnancy]]: unclear etiology.
* [[Cancers]]: tumours in the kidney can operate in the same way as kidney disease. More commonly, however, tumors cause inessential hypertension by ectopic secretion of hormones involved in normal physiological control of blood pressure.
* [[Medication|Drugs]]: In particular, [[alcohol]], nasal decongestants with adrenergic effects, [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAID]]s, [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAOI]]s, [[Adrenergic receptor|adrenoceptor]] stimulants, and combined methods of [[hormonal contraception]] (those containing ethinyl-estradiol) can cause hypertension while in use.
**Heavy [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] use
**[[Steroid]] use
**[[Nicotine]] use.<ref name="jnc7" />
* Malformed [[aorta]], [[slow pulse]], [[ischemia]]: these cause reduced blood flow to the renal arteries, with physiological responses as already outlined.
** [[Aortic valve disease]]: unclear etiology.
**[[Coarcation of the aorta]]
**[[Atherosclerosis]]
* [[Anemia]]: unclear etiology.
* [[Fever]]: unclear etiology.
* [[White coat hypertension]], that is, elevated blood pressure in a clinical setting but not in other settings, probably due to the anxiety some people experience during a clinic visit.
* ''Perioperative hypertension'' is development of hypertension just before, during or after [[surgery]]. It may occur before surgery during the induction of [[anesthesia]]; intraoperatively e.g. by pain-induced [[sympathetic nervous system]] stimulation; in the early postanesthesia period, e.g. by pain-induced sympathetic stimulation, [[hypothermia]], [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], or [[hypervolemia]] from excessive intraoperative fluid therapy; and in the 24 to 48 hours after the postoperativ period as fluid is mobilized from the extravascular space. In addition, hypertension may develop perioperatively because of discontinuation of long-term antihypertensive medication.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Varon J, Marik PE |title=Perioperative hypertension management |journal=Vasc Health Risk Manag |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=615–27 |year=2008 |pmid=18827911 |pmc=2515421 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Another adrenal related cause is [[Cushing's syndrome]] which is a disorder caused by high levels of [[cortisol]]. Cortisol is a [[hormone]] secreted by the [[adrenal cortex|cortex]] of the [[adrenal glands]]. Cushing's syndrome can be caused by taking [[glucocorticoid]] drugs, or by tumors that produce cortisol or [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH).<ref>Kumar, Abbas, Fausto.

Depending on the severity of the increase in blood pressure, rebound hypertension may result in a [[hypertensive emergency]].

===Arsenic exposure===
Because of the ubiquity of arsenic in ground water supplies and its effect on cardiovascular health, low dose [[arsenic poisoning]] should be inferred as a part of the pathogenesis of idiopathic hypertension. Idiopathic and essential are both somewhat synonymous with primary hypertension. Arsenic exposure has also many of the same signs of primary hypertension such as [[headache]], [[somnolence]],

===Potassium deficiency===
Due to the role of intracellular potassium in regulation of cellular pressures related to sodium, establishing potassium balance has been shown to reverse hypertension.
