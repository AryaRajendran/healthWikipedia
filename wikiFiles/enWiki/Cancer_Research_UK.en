'''Cancer Research UK''' is a [[cancer research]] and awareness charity in the [[United Kingdom]],<ref>{{EW charity|1089464}}</ref> formed on 4 February 2002 by the merger of The Cancer Research Campaign and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund.<ref name="Gaze2002" /> Its aim is to reduce the number of deaths from [[cancer]]. As the world's largest independent cancer research charity<ref name="merge">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1703612.stm |title="Cancer charity mega-merger" | work=BBC News | date=11 December 2001}}</ref><ref>http://www.charitiesdirect.com/charities/top500.php</ref> it conducts research into the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Research activities are carried out in institutes, universities and hospitals across the UK, both by the charity's own employees and by its grant-funded researchers. It also provides information about cancer and runs campaigns aimed at raising awareness of the disease and influencing public policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboutus.cancerresearchuk.org/prod_consump/groups/cr_common/@abt/@gen/documents/generalcontent/cr_075236.pdf |title=Annual Report and Accounts |publisher= |date=2001-12-11 |accessdate=2011-04-04}}</ref><ref>http://aboutus.cancerresearchuk.org/prod_consump/groups/cr_common/@abt/@gen/documents/generalcontent/cr_043577.pdf Report on 2008/9 research activities</ref><ref>http://aboutus.cancerresearchuk.org/prod_consump/groups/cr_common/@abt/@gen/documents/generalcontent/cr_075376.pdf Annual Review 2010/11</ref>

Cancer Research UK's work is almost entirely funded by the public. It raises money through donations, legacies, community fundraising, events, retail and corporate partnerships. Over 40,000 people are regular volunteers.<ref name="Saving lives: Annual report 2010/11"/>

On 18 July 2012 it was announced that Cancer Research UK was to receive its largest ever single donation of £10 million from an anonymous donor. The money will go towards the £100 million funding needed for the Francis Crick Institute in London, the largest biomedical research building in Europe.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate = 18 July 2012 | date = 18 July 1012 | newspaper = Cambridge News | title = Cancer Research UK is handed £10m}}</ref>

== History ==
The '''Imperial Cancer Research Fund''' (ICRF) was founded in 1902 as the Cancer Research Fund, changing its name to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund two years later. The charity grew over the next twenty years to become one of the world's leading cancer research charities.<ref name="Austoker"/> Its flagship laboratories at Lincoln's Inn Fields and Clare Hall are now known as the Cancer Research UK [[London Research Institute]].<ref name="merge"/>

The British Empire Cancer Campaign (BECC) was founded in 1923, and initially drew a hostile response from ICRF and the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]], who considered it a rival.<ref name="Austoker">Austoker, Joan. ''A history of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, 1902-1986.'' Oxford University Press, 1988.</ref><ref name="Wellcome">[http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cats/20/4605.htm Cancer Research Campaign formerly British Empire Cancer Campaign], 1923-1981. [[Wellcome Library]] Archive. Retrieved 1 February 2011</ref> "The Campaign", as it was colloquially known, became a very successful and powerful grant-giving body. In 1970, the charity was renamed '''The Cancer Research Campaign''' (CRC).<ref name="Wellcome"/>

In 2002 the two charities agreed to merge to form Cancer Research UK, the largest independent research organisation in the world dedicated to fighting cancer (the largest, the [[National Cancer Institute]], is funded by the US Government).<ref name="Guardian 2002">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2002/feb/04/charities.charitymanagement World's biggest cancer charity formed], ''The Guardian'', 4 February 2002.</ref><ref name="pmid11875441">{{cite journal |author= |title=Cancer Research UK |journal=Nat.

==Activities==
=== Research ===
In the financial year 2010/11 the charity spent £332 million on cancer research projects (around 69% of its total income for that year). The bulk of the remaining costs were spent on trading and fundraising costs, with a small amount also spent on information services, campaigning and advocacy, administration, on other activities, or held in reserve.<ref name="Saving lives: Annual report 2010/11"/>  The charity funds the work of over 4,000 researchers, doctors and nurses throughout the UK, supports over 200 clinical trials and studies cancer and cancer risk in over a million people in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboutus.cancerresearchuk.org/what-we-do/ |title=Cancer Research UK: What we do |publisher=Aboutus.cancerresearchuk.org |date=2011-03-31 |accessdate=2011-04-04}}</ref> Around 40% of the charity's research expenditure goes on basic laboratory research relevant to all types of cancer into the [[molecular]] basis of cancer.  The research is intended to improve understanding of how cancer develops and spreads and thus provide a foundation for other research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboutus.cancerresearchuk.org/what-we-do/our-annual-publications-and-strategy/5-year-strategy/ |title=Cancer Research UK: Our strategy 2009-2014 |publisher=Aboutus.cancerresearchuk.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-04}}</ref> The rest of its funding is used to support research into over 100 specific cancer types, focusing on key areas such as [[drug discovery]] and development; prevention, early detection and [[Medical imaging|imaging]]; surgery and [[radiotherapy]]; and cancers where survival is still low, such as oesophageal, lung and pancreatic cancers.<ref>http://aboutus.cancerresearchuk.org/what-we-do/our-annual-publications-and-strategy/annual-report-and-accounts/</ref>

The [[prostate cancer]] drug [[abiraterone]] was discovered in the Cancer Research UK Centre for Cancer Therapeutics at the [[Institute of Cancer Research]] in London.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2011/09/21/where-did-abiraterone-come-from/| title = Where did abiraterone come from? | author = Scowcroft H | date = 21 September 2011| work = Science Update blog | publisher = Cancer Research UK | accessdate = 2011-09-28 }}</ref>

In June 2011 it was reported that the animal rights organisation [[Animal Aid]] plans to place a series of adverts in British newspapers urging members of the public to stop giving donations to Cancer Research UK and the [[British Heart Foundation]], the [[Alzheimer's Society]] and [[Parkinson's UK]] unless they cease their support for research which involves animal testing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/animal-rights-group-declares-war-on-leading-health-charities-2300281.html|title=Animal rights group declares war on leading health charities|accessdate=9 July 2011|publisher=The Independent|date=21 June 2011|location=London|first=Oliver|last=Wright}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.scotsman.com/science/Charities-are--attacked-over.6788444.jp | location=Edinburgh | work=The Scotsman | date=20 June 2011}}</ref>
