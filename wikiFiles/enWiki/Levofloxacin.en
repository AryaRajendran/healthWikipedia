Levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones are generally well tolerated, but in rare instances have produced serious and life-threatening adverse reactions as well as spontaneous tendon ruptures and irreversible [[peripheral neuropathy]]. Tendon damage may manifest months after therapy had been completed and in severe cases may result in lifelong disabilities. Other controversies associated with this drug include increasing resistance due to their overuse. This overuse includes situations in which antibiotic therapy is unnecessary, and others in which the use of a less broad spectrum agent would produce equivalent results.

{{As of|2011}}, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has added two [[Black box warning]]s for this drug in reference to spontaneous tendon ruptures and the fact that levofloxacin may cause worsening of [[myasthenia gravis]] symptoms, including muscle weakness and breathing problems. Such an adverse reaction is a potentially life-threatening event and may require ventilatory support.<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/020634s058,020635s064,021721s025lbl.pdf label<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Availability===
Levofloxacin is available in tablet form, injection, oral solution, as well as used in prescription eye and ear drops.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>. In India it is marketed by Intas under the trade name ''''Flolev''''.

==Contraindications==
[[File:Levofloxacin.jpg|thumb|Levofloxacin 750mg IV]]
There is one contraindication now found within the 2008 package insert for Levaquin, namely that Levaquin is to be avoided in patients with a known hypersensitivity to levofloxacin or other quinolone drugs.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Caution should be exercised in prescribing to patients with [[liver disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Coban S, Ceydilek B, Ekiz F, Erden E, Soykan I |title=Levofloxacin-induced acute fulminant hepatic failure in a patient with chronic hepatitis B infection |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=1737–40 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16105873 |doi=10.1345/aph.1G111 }}</ref>

Levofloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated in patients with [[epilepsy]] or other seizure disorders.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

;Pregnancy
According to the FDA approved [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/EmergencyPreparedness/BioterrorismandDrugPreparedness/UCM133684.pdf Prescribing Information], levofloxacin is [[Pregnancy_category#United_States|Pregnancy Category]] C.  This designation indicates that animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans but the potential benefit to the mother may in some cases outweigh the risk to the fetus.

At 12 months follow-up the cumulative incidence of musculoskeletal adverse events was 3.4%, compared to 1.8% among 893 patients treated with other antibiotics.  In the levafloxacin-treated group, approximately two-thirds of these musculoskeletal AEs occurred in the first 60 days, 86% were mild, 17% were moderate, and all resolved without long-term sequelae.

In a study comparing the safety and efficacy of levofloxacin to that of azithromycin or the ceftriaxone in 712 children with community-acquired pneumonia, serious adverse events were experienced by 6% of those treated with levofloxacin and 4% of those treated with comparator antibiotics. Most of these were considered by the treating physician to be unrelated or doubtfully related to the study drug. Two deaths were observed in the levofloxacin group, neither of which was thought to be treatment-related. Spontaneous reports to the FDA Adverse Effects Reporting System at the time of the 20 September 2011 FDA Pediatric Drugs Advisory Committee include musculoskeletal events (39, including 5 cases of tendon rupture) and CNS events (19, including 5 cases of seizures) as the most common spontaneous reports between April 2005 and March 2008. An estimated 130,000 pediatric prescriptions for levofloxacin were filled on behalf of 112,000 pediatric patients during that period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/08/slides/2008-4399s1-06%20%28Levofloxacin%29.pdf |title=www.fda.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Special precautions==

Levofloxacin should be administered ''only'' as described within the Dosage Guidelines table found within the most current package insert. The status of the patient's renal function and hepatic function ''must'' also be taken into consideration to avoid an accumulation that may lead to a fatal drug overdose. Levofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion. However, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the liver and the intestine. Modification of the dosage is ''recommended'' using the table found within the package insert for those with impaired liver or kidney function ''(particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction).'' Within the package insert, it is stated "...since the drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function."<ref name="ReferenceB"/> The duration of treatment depends upon the ''severity'' of infection, in the range of 3 days to 60 days.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

==Overdose==
In the event of an acute overdosage, the stomach should be emptied. The patient should be observed and appropriate hydration maintained. Levofloxacin is not efficiently removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

==Pharmacology==
Levofloxacin is the L-isomer of the racemate ''ofloxacin'', a quinolone antimicrobial agent.
In chemical terms, levofloxacin, a chiral fluorinated carboxyquinolone, is the pure
(-)-(S)-enantiomer of the racemic drug substance ofloxacin. The chemical name is (-)-(S)-9fluoro-2,3-dihydro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-7H-pyrido[1,2,3-de]-1,4benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid hemihydrate. The empirical formula is C<sub>18</sub></sup>H<sub>20</sub>FN<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> • ½ H2O, and the molecular weight is 370.38. Levofloxacin is a light-yellowish-white to yellow-white crystal or crystalline powder.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Some of the endogenous compounds that are affected by the levofloxacin include GABA receptors (inhibitor), OCTN2 (inhibitor),<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hirano T, Yasuda S, Osaka Y | title = The inhibitory effects of fluoroquinolones on L-carnitine transport in placental cell line BeWo | journal = International Journal of Pharmaceutics | volume = 351 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 113–8 | year = 2008 | month = March | pmid = 17977676 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2007.09.022 }}</ref> blood glucose (alteration) potassium channels (in myocardial cells – inhibitor),<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Friedrich | first1 = LV. | last2 = Dougherty | first2 = R. | title = Fatal hypoglycemia associated with levofloxacin | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 24 | issue = 12 | pages = 1807–12 | month= December| year = 2004 | doi = 10.1592/phco.24.17.1807.52348 | pmid = 15585448 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/496197 }}</ref> pancreatic β-cell potassium channels (inhibitor)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Melissa Hunt |month=January |year=2007 |title=Levofloxacin: dysglycemia and liver disorders |journal=Canadian adverse reaction newsletter |volume=17 |issue=1 |publisher=Health Canada Newsletter |location=Canada |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/alt_formats/hpfb-dgpsa/pdf/medeff/carn-bcei_v17n1-eng.pdf |format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> and glutathione (depletor).
Levofloxacin can be used effectively as a positive control in thorough QT/QTc studies in healthy volunteers and can fulfil the criteria for a positive comparator. The ICH E14 guidelines recommend a threshold of around 5 ms for a positive QT/QTc study. The largest time-matched difference in QTc for levofloxacin suggests the potential for use in more rigorous QT/QTc studies.<ref>[http://www.richmondpharmacology.com/downloads/Publications/bcp_3595_rpl.pdf Levofloxacin can be used effectively as a positive control in thorough QT/QTc studies in healthy volunteers]{{cite journal|last=Taubel|first=Jorg|coauthors=Naseem, A., Harada, T., Wang, D., Arezina, R., Lorch, U. and Camm, A.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Levofloxacin pharmacokinetics are linear and predictable after single and multiple oral or IV dosing regimens. Levofloxacin is rapidly and, in essence, completely absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations are usually attained one to two hours after oral dosing. The plasma concentration profile of levofloxacin after IV administration is similar and comparable in extent of exposure (AUC) to that observed for LEVAQUIN Tablets when equal doses (mg/mg) are administered. Levofloxacin is excreted largely as unchanged drug in the urine. The mean terminal plasma elimination half-life of levofloxacin ranges from approximately 6 to 8 hours following single or multiple doses of levofloxacin given orally or intravenously.<ref name="ReferenceB" /><ref name=sdcfl />
Glucuronidation and hydroxylation have been cited as one of the major metabolic pathways for levofloxacin hydrochloride.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00478 |title=Showing drug card for Rimantadine (DB00478) |location=Canada |date=23 June 2009 }}</ref> However the drug card for levofloxacin ([http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01137 DB01137]) states that the biotransformation information is not available.<ref name=sdcfl/> Specific information regarding biotransformation does not appear to be readily available within the package inserts.

==Mechanism of action==
Levofloxacin is a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] that is active against both
[[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] bacteria. It functions by inhibiting [[DNA gyrase]], a type II [[topoisomerase]], and topoisomerase iv,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Drlica K, Zhao X |title=DNA gyrase, topoisomerase IV, and the 4-quinolones |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=377–92 |date=1 September 1997|pmid=9293187 |pmc=232616 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9293187 }}</ref> which is an enzyme necessary to separate replicated DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division. This can also affect mammalian cell replication. In particular, some congeners of this drug family display activity not only against bacterial topoisomerases but also against eukaryotic topoisomerases, and are toxic to cultured mammalian cells and ''in vivo'' tumor models.

==Interactions==
Levofloxacin interacts with other drugs, as well as herbal and natural supplements. Such interactions increase the risk of [[cardiotoxicity]] and [[arrhythmia]]s, [[anticoagulation]], the formation of non-absorbable complexes, as well as increasing the risk of toxicity.<ref name=sdcfl>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01137 |title= Showing drug card for Levofloxacin (DB01137) |author=DrugBank |location=Canada |date=19 February 2009 }}</ref>

The toxicity of drugs that are metabolised by the [[cytochrome P450]] system is enhanced by concomitant use of some quinolones. Coadministration may dangerously increase [[warfarin]] (Coumadin) activity; INR should be monitored closely. They may also interact with the [[GABA A receptor]] and cause neurological symptoms; this effect is augmented by certain [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brouwers JR |title=Drug interactions with quinolone antibacterials |journal=Drug Saf |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=268–81 |year=1992 |pmid=1524699 |doi=10.2165/00002018-199207040-00003 }}</ref> [[Quercetin]], a [[flavonol]], a kind of flavonoid, occasionally used as a [[dietary supplement]], may interact with fluoroquinolones, as quercetin competitively binds to bacterial DNA gyrase. Some foods such as [[garlic]] and [[apple]]s contain high levels of [[quercetin]]; whether this inhibits or enhances the effect of fluoroquinolones is not entirely clear.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hilliard JJ, Krause HM, Bernstein JI |title=A comparison of active site binding of 4-quinolones and novel flavone gyrase inhibitors to DNA gyrase |journal=Adv Exp Med Biol. |volume=390 |pages=59–69 |year=1995 |pmid=8718602 }}</ref>

Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with levofloxacin. However, the systemic administration of some quinolones has been shown to interfere with the metabolism of caffeine, elevate plasma concentrations of theophylline, and enhance the effects of the warfarin and its derivatives. In patients receiving systemic cyclosporine concomitantly, transient elevations in serum creatinine has been noted.<ref name=sdcfl/>

===Significant drug interactions===
Levofloxacin has been reported to interact with other drugs, as well as herbal and natural supplements. Such interactions increased the risk of cardiotoxicity and arrhythmias, anticoagulant effects, the formation of non-absorbable complexes, as well as increasing the risk of toxicity.

Some drug interactions are associated with molecular structural modifications of the quinolone ring, specifically interactions involving NSAIDS and [[theophylline]]. Ciprofloxacin has been shown to interact with thyroid medications (levothyroxine) resulting in unexplained [[hypothyroidism]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cooper JG, Harboe K, Frost SK, Skadberg Ø |title=Ciprofloxacin interacts with thyroid replacement therapy |journal=BMJ |volume=330 |issue=7498 |page=1002 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15860826 |pmc=557149 |doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7498.1002 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7498/1002}}</ref> As such it is possible that levofloxacin may interact with thyroid medications as well.

The use of NSAIDs (Non-Steroid Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) while undergoing fluoroquinolone therapy is contraindicated due to the risk of severe CNS adverse reactions, including but not limited to seizure disorders. Fluoroquinolones with an unsubstituted piperazinyl moiety at position 7 have the potential to interact with NSAIDs and/or their metabolites, resulting in antagonism of [[GABA]] neurotransmission.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Domagala JM |title=Structure-activity and structure-side-effect relationships for the quinolone antibacterials |journal=J. Antimicrob. Chemother. |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=685–706 |year=1994 |month=April |pmid=8056688 |doi= 10.1093/jac/33.4.685|url=http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/33/4/685}}</ref> Whether or not such reactions occur after completion of therapy is unclear. Patients have reported reactions to NSAIDS long after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy, but there does not appear to be any research that would either confirm or deny this association other than these anecdotal reports.

Some quinolones exert an inhibitory effect on the cytochrome P-450 system, thereby reducing theophylline clearance and increasing theophylline blood levels. Coadministration of certain fluoroquinolones and other drugs primarily metabolized by [[CYP1A2]] (e.g., theophylline, [[methylxanthines]], [[tizanidine]]) results in increased plasma concentrations and could lead to clinically significant side-effects of the coadministered drug. In addition, other fluoroquinolones, especially [[enoxacin]], and to a lesser extent ciprofloxacin and [[pefloxacin]], also inhibit the metabolic clearance of theophylline.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Janknegt R |title=Drug interactions with quinolones |journal=J. Antimicrob. Chemother. |volume=26 Suppl D |issue= |pages=7–29 |year=1990 |month=November |pmid=2286594 |doi= }}</ref>

Such drug interactions appear to be related to the structural changes of the quinolone ring and the inhibitory effect on the cytochrome P-450 system. As such, these drug interactions involving the fluoroquinolones appear to be drug-specific rather than a class effect.

Current or past treatment with oral [[corticosteroids]] is associated with an increased risk of [[Achilles tendon]] rupture, especially in elderly patients also taking the fluoroquinolones. This effect seems to be restricted to people aged 60 or over and within this group concomitant use of corticosteroids increases this risk substantially.<ref name=nda18dec2001/><ref>{{cite journal |author=van der Linden PD, Sturkenboom MC, Herings RM, Leufkens HM, Rowlands S, Stricker BH |title=Increased risk of achilles tendon rupture with quinolone antibacterial use, especially in elderly patients taking oral corticosteroids |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=163 |issue=15 |pages=1801–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12912715 |doi=10.1001/archinte.163.15.1801 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/15/1801}}</ref>

Fluoroquinolones are associated with false-positive results for opiates on urine opiate screening drug test. Of the fluoroquinolones, Ofloxacin and Levofloxacin are most likely to cause false positive results. Most levels detected are below (2000&nbsp;ng/mL). A false-positive result may be ruled out by using a more specific test, usually gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Therefore, any patient who screens positive for opiates but denies taking them and has recently taken a Fluoroquinolone should be offered more specific testing.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zacher |first1=JL |last2=Givone |first2=DM |title=False-positive urine opiate screening associated with fluoroquinolone use |work=Ann Pharmacother |year=2004 |issue=38 |pages=1525–1528}}</ref>

Cardiac antidysrhythmics that prolong the QT interval should not be used in combination with levofloxacin due to the risk of torsades and R on T syndrome. Common medications still in use today include amiodarone, tykosin, and propafenone. Older medication such as ethmozine, quinidine, and mexilitine should be avoided as well.

==History==
Levofloxacin is a [[quinolones|fluoroquinolone]] [[antibiotic]], marketed by [[Sanofi-Aventis]] under the tradename "Tavanic".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/drugs/levofloxacin-075755.htm#U.S.%20Brand%20Names |title=Levofloxacin |author=[[University of Maryland Medical Center]] |publisher=University of Maryland |location=USA }}</ref> Levaquin is also marketed worldwide for oral and IV use, as well as used in ophthalmic solutions.

Levofloxacin was first patented in 1987 (Levofloxacin European patent – Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) and was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] on 20 December 1996 for use in the United States to treat bacterial sinusitus, bacterial exacerbations of bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, uncomplicated skin infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and acute pyelonephritis.<ref name="www.accessdata.fda.gov">{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/96/020634-1.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Levaquin sample boxes showed a [[macron]] over the letter "e," indicating pronunciation with a long-"e" sound, although Merriam-Webster indicates a short-"e" pronunciation. Levofloxacin would typically be pronounced with the long-e from the Latin prefix "levo-" (meaning left).

Levofloxacin is marketed worldwide under many brand names, making post-marketing surveillance difficult.<ref>Cravit, Cravit Ophthalmic, Elequine, Floxel, Iquix, Leroxacin, Lesacin, Levaquin, Levokacin, Levox, Levoxacin, Mosardal, Nofaxin, Quixin, Reskuin, Tavanic, Volequin http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01137</ref><ref>Cravox, Floxlevo, Levoxacine, Levoxetina, Nislev, Oftaquix, Prixar, Reskuin, Tavanic source: http://www.umm.edu/altmed/drugs/levofloxacin-075755.htm#International%20Brand%20Names</ref>

In addition, generic versions of levofloxacin had been available since 2004 and marketed as a generic drug under a variety of different brand names. However, Daiichi Sankyo-Johnson and Johnson-Ortho McNeil filed numerous patent lawsuits to prevent such generic equivalents from being marketed, claiming that their patent did not expire until 23 June 2009.<ref name="investing.businessweek.com">{{cite web |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4240255 |title=Novopharm Limited |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |publisher= |location=USA |date=3 November 2009 }}</ref> see [[Levofloxacin#Generic equivalents|Generic equivalents]]

===Regulatory history in the United States===
Levofloxacin was first patented in 1987, and was subsequently approved for use in Japan (1 October 1993), Korea (4 April 1994), Hong Kong (3 October 1994), and China (3 May 1995). Levofloxacin received FDA approval in the United States 20 December 1996. Floxin (ofloxacin – floxacin) was patented in 1982 (European patent Daiichi) and received FDA approval 28 December 1990. The U.S. patent is owned by Daiichi Sankyo and exclusively licensed to Ortho-McNeil.<ref name="www.accessdata.fda.gov"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://apps.shareholder.com/sec/viewerContent.aspx?companyid=JNJ&docid=2940855 |title=UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION |author=JOHNSON & JOHNSON |publisher=shareholder.com |location=USA |pages=28–29 |date=28 March 2004 }}</ref>

Many of the clinical isolates that were initially tested within the NDA for levofloxacin against Floxin (ofloxacin –floxacin) disks instead of levofloxacin disks but reported as susceptible or resistant to levofloxacin. When levofloxacin disks were not available in early clinical trials, a 5-pg Floxin (ofloxacin –floxacin) disk was substituted. The FDA medical reviewers considered the two drugs to be one and the same and hence interchangeable.<ref name="www.accessdata.fda.gov"/>

==Antibiotic abuse and bacterial resistance==
{{See also|Antibiotic abuse|Antibiotic resistance}}
[[antibiotic resistance|Resistance]] to levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones may evolve rapidly, even during a course of treatment. Numerous [[pathogen]]s, including ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', [[enterococci]], and ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' now exhibit resistance worldwide.<ref>M Jacobs, Worldwide Overview of Antimicrobial Resistance. International Symposium on Antimicrobial Agents and Resistance 2005.</ref> There are three known mechanisms of resistance. Some types of [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] pumps can act to decrease intracellular quinolone concentration. In gram-negative bacteria, plasmid-mediated resistance genes produce proteins that can bind to [[DNA gyrase]], protecting it from the action of quinolones. Finally, mutations at key sites in DNA gyrase or [[Topoisomerase IV]] can decrease their binding affinity to quinolones, decreasing the drug's effectiveness.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Robicsek A, Jacoby GA, Hooper DC | title = The worldwide emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance | journal = The Lancet Infectious Diseases | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | pages = 629–40 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 17008172 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(06)70599-0 }}</ref>

Years ago, the FDA had added warnings regarding the proper use of Levaquin within the package inserts to combat such prescription abuse. Advising physicians that levofloxacin: "...should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria...."<ref name=ndafdamar2004/>

Though considered to be a very important and necessary drug required to treat severe and life-threatening bacterial infections, the associated prescription abuse of levofloxacin remains unchecked, which has contributed to the problem of bacterial resistance. The [[overuse of antibiotic]]s, such as happens with children suffering from [[otitis media]], has given rise to a breed of super-bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics entirely.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Froom J, Culpepper L, Jacobs M | title = Antimicrobials for acute otitis media?

Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, had become the most commonly prescribed class of antibiotics to adults in 2002.

==Social and economic impact==
{{See also|Quinolone#Social and economic impact}}

===Patent extensions===
From 2001–2008, patent extension legislation was signed into law that allowed a six-month patent extension for testing their products for safety in children, an under-represented category in clinical trials. The FDA granted Johnson and Johnson–Ortho McNeil pediatric exclusivity for Levaquin. This extended their patent until the end of 2010.

===Generic equivalents===
In 2005, the [[US Court of Appeals]] for the Federal Circuit had affirmed the validity of US patent (No. 5,053,407) on levofloxacin, held by Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. On 17 October 2006, [[Daiichi Sankyo]] also won a patent infringement lawsuit in Canada involving the generic version of Levaquin. The Canadian Federal Appeals Court upheld a lower court's ruling handed down last October, which accepted the validity of Daiichi Sankyo's patent until 23 June 2009. Daiichi Sankyo and Janssen-Ortho Inc., a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary, filed a lawsuit with a federal court in Toronto after [[Teva Canada|Teva Novopharm]] Ltd., started selling the generic version of levofloxacin in December 2004. The Canadian Federal Court in Toronto ordered Novopharm to suspend selling the generic version of the drug. Unsatisfied with the ruling, Novopharm appealed to the higher court.<ref name="investing.businessweek.com"/> On 7 June 2007, the Canadian Federal Appeal Court dismissed this appeal. Novopharm was prevented from making, using, offering to sell, or selling a generic version of levofloxacin tablets in the Canadian market until the expiration of patent on 23 June 2009. Novopharm's generic version of Levaquin, had been sold in Canada since 2004.

==Current litigation==
An official complaint has been filed by The US Justice Department with a Federal Court in Boston (January 2010) accusing Johnson and Johnson of illegally paying millions of dollars in kickbacks to Omnicare, one of the nation's largest pharmacies specializing in nursing home patients.
