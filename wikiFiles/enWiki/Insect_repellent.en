An '''insect repellent''' is a substance applied to skin, clothing, or other surfaces which discourages [[insect]]s (and [[arthropod]]s in general) from landing or climbing on that surface. There are also insect repellent products available based on sound production, particularly [[ultrasound]] (inaudibly high frequency sounds). These electronic devices have been shown to have no effect as a mosquito repellent by studies done by the EPA and many universities.<ref>{{cite press release | title = Mosquito repellents that emit high-pitched sounds don't prevent bites | date= April 17, 2007 | publisher = [[Eurekalert!]]| url = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-04/jws-mrt041607.php}}</ref>

Insect repellents help prevent and control the outbreak of [[Vector (epidemiology)|insect-borne]] diseases such as [[malaria]], [[Lyme disease]], [[dengue fever]], [[bubonic plague]], and [[West Nile fever]].  Pest animals commonly serving as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] for disease include the insects [[flea]], [[fly]], and [[mosquito]]; and the arachnid [[tick]].

==Common insect repellents==
* [[Birch]] tree bark is traditionally made into [[tar]]. Combined with another oil (i.e. fish oil) at 1/2 dilution, it is then applied to the skin for repelling mosquitos<ref>Happy people: A year in the Taiga</ref><ref>[http://www.jonsbushcraft.com/birchtar.htm Making birch bark tar]</ref><ref>[http://www.sacredearth.com/ethnobotany/plantprofiles/birch.php Birch bark used as mosquito repellent]</ref>
* [[DEET]] (''N'',''N''-diethyl-''m''-toluamide)
* [[Essential oil]] of the [[lemon eucalyptus]] (''Corymbia citriodora'') and its active compound [[p-menthane-3,8-diol]] (PMD)
* [[Icaridin]], also known as picaridin, Bayrepel, and KBR 3023
* [[Nepetalactone]], also known as "catnip oil"
* [[Citronella oil]]<ref name="citronellaepa"/>
* [[Neem oil]]
* [[Bog Myrtle]]
* [[Dimethyl carbate]]
* Tricyclodecenyl allyl ether, a compound often found in [[Perfume|synthetic perfumes]].<ref>[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/55017187/Insect-Repellents---Patent-6660288 Insect Repellents - Patent 6660288]</ref><ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/EP1119250.html Detailed patent information]</ref>
* [[IR3535]] (3-[N-Butyl-N-acetyl]-aminopropionic acid, ethyl ester)
* Ethylhexanediol or "6-12 repellent," discontinued in the US in 1991 due to evidence of causing developmental defects in animals<ref>[http://www.entmclasses.umd.edu/peap/leaflets/PIL10.pdf Brown, Maryland Extension Service leaflet 10]</ref>
* [[Permethrin]] is different in that it is actually a contact [[insecticide]].
* A more recent repellent being currently researched is [[SS220]], which has been shown to provide significantly better protection than DEET.

A test of various insect repellents by an independent consumer organization found that repellents containing DEET or picaridin are more effective than repellents with "natural" active ingredients. All the synthetics gave almost 100% repellency for the first 2 hours, where the natural repellent products were most effective for the first 30 to 60&nbsp;minutes, and required reapplication to be effective over several hours.<ref>[http://www.choice.com.au/viewArticle.aspx?id=105015&catId=100281&tid=100008&p=5&title=Test%3a+Mosquito+repellents "Test: Mosquito Repellents, The Verdict" Choice, The Australian Consumers Association]</ref>

== Repellent safety ==

Regarding [[safety]] with insect repellent use on [[children]] and [[pregnant]] women:

*  Children may be at greater risk for adverse reactions to repellents, in part, because their exposure may be greater.
*  Keep repellents out of the reach of children.
*  Do not allow children to apply repellents to themselves.
*  Use only small amounts of repellent on children.
*  Do not apply repellents to the hands of young children because this may result in accidental eye contact or ingestion.
*  Try to reduce the use of repellents by dressing children in long sleeves and long pants tucked into boots or socks whenever possible. Use netting over strollers, playpens, etc.
*  As with chemical exposures in general, pregnant women should take care to avoid exposures to repellents when practical, as the [[fetus]] may be vulnerable.

Regardless of which repellent product used, it is recommended to read the [[label]] before use and carefully follow directions.<ref>[http://www.health.ny.gov/publications/2737/ "Health Advisory: Tick and Insect Repellents", Information factsheet, Department of Health, New York State]</ref> Usage instructions for repellents vary from country to country. Some insect repellents are not recommended for use on younger children.<ref name="CDC" />

In the DEET Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) reported 14 to 46 cases of potential DEET associated [[seizures]], including 4 deaths. The EPA states: "... it does appear that some cases are likely related to DEET [[toxicity]]," but observed that with 30% of the US population using DEET, the likely seizure rate is only about one per 100 million users.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/0002red.pdf "Reregistration Eligibility Decision: DEET." U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances. September 1998. pp39-40]</ref>

The Pesticide Information Project of Cooperative Extension Offices of [[Cornell University]] states that, "[[Everglades National Park]] employees having extensive DEET exposure were more likely to have insomnia, mood disturbances and impaired cognitive function than were lesser exposed co-workers".<ref name="EXTOXNET">[http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/carbaryl-dicrotophos/deet-ext.html Deet]</ref>

The EPA states that citronella oil shows little or no [[toxicity]] and has been used as a topical insect repellent for 60 years. However, the EPA also states that citronella may irritate skin and cause [[dermatitis]] in certain individuals.<ref name="citronellaepa">{{cite web | title=Citronella (Oil of Citronella) (021901) Fact Sheet |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |date=16 February 2011|url= http://www.epa.gov/oppbppd1/biopesticides/ingredients/factsheets/factsheet_021901.htm |accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref> Canadian regulatory authorities concern with citronella based repellents is primarily based on data-gaps in [[toxicology]], not on incidents.<ref>{{cite book | url = http://www.pmra-arla.gc.ca/english/pdf/pacr/pacr2004-36-e.pdf | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080711205145/http://www.pmra-arla.gc.ca/english/pdf/pacr/pacr2004-36-e.pdf | archivedate = 2008-07-11 | publisher = Pest Management Regulatory Agency (Canada) | title = Re-evaluation of Citronella Oil and Related Active Compounds for Use as Personal Insect Repellents | work = Responsible Pesticide Use | date = 17 September 2004 | isbn = 978-0-662-38012-2|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cropwatch.org/newsletter2.htm  "So Then: Who’s Afraid of Citronella Oil?

Within countries of the European Union, implementation of Regulation 98/8/EC,<ref>{{cite web|title=Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1998:123:0001:0063:EN:PDF|work=Official Journal of the European Communities|accessdate=1 July 2011|date=16 February 1998}}</ref> commonly referred to as the Biocidal Products Directive, has severely limited the number and type of insect repellents available to European consumers. Only a small number of active ingredients have been supported by manufacturers in submitting dossiers to the EU Authorities. 

In general, only formulations containing DEET, icaridin (sold under the trade name Saltidin and formerly known as Bayrepel or KBR3023), [[IR3535]] (3-[N-Butyl-N-acetyl]-aminopropionic acid, ethyl ester) and Citriodiol ([[p-menthane-3,8-diol]]) are available. Most "natural" insect repellents such as citronella, neem oil, and herbal extracts are no longer permitted for sale as insect repellents in the EU;  this does not preclude them from being sold for other purposes, as long as the label does not indicate they are a biocide (insect repellent).

== Insect repellents from natural sources ==

There are many preparations from naturally occurring sources that are repellent to certain insects. Some of these act as [[insecticides]] while others are only repellent.

This was based on testing done by Johns Hopkins<ref>http://www.homs.com/Johns%20Hopkins%20Report.pdf</ref> and Cornell Universities.<ref>http://www.homs.com/ERAP-%20West%20Nile%20Virus%20-%20Cornell%20University%20Center%20for%20the%20Environment.pdf</ref> Other commercial products offered for household mosquito "control" include small electrical mats, mosquito repellent vapor, DEET-impregnated wrist bands, and [[mosquito coil]]s containing a form of the chemical [[allethrin]]. Mosquito-repellent candles containing citronella oil are sold widely in the U.S. These have been used with mixed reports of success and failure.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lindsay|first=L.R.|coauthors=Surgeoner, G.A.; Heal, J.D.; Gallivan, G.J.|title=Evaluation of the efficacy of 3% citronella candles and 5% citronella incense for protection against field populations of Aedes mosquitoes|journal=Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association|year=1996|month=June|volume=12|issue=2|pages=293–294|pmid=8827606}}</ref>

Some old studies suggested that the ingestion of large doses of [[thiamin]] could be effective as an [[mouth|oral]] insect repellent against mosquito bites. However, there is now conclusive evidence that thiamin has no efficacy against mosquito bites.<ref>[http://clinicalevidence.bmj.com/ceweb/conditions/ind/0903/0903_I1177594695224.jsp BMJ Clinical Evidence]</ref><ref name="pmid16033124">{{cite journal

Some claim that  plants like [[artemisia (genus)|wormwood]] or sagewort, [[lemon balm]], [[lemon grass]], [[thyme|lemon thyme]] and the [[Pelargonium|mosquito plant (Pelargonium)]] will act against mosquitoes. However, scientists have determined that these plants are “effective” for a limited time only when the leaves are crushed and applied directly to the skin.<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/438257_2 Medscape: Medscape Access<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

There are several, widespread, unproven theories about [[mosquito control]], such as the assertion that [[vitamin B]], in particular B<sub>1</sub> ([[thiamine]]), [[garlic]], [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] devices or [[incense]] can be used to repel or control mosquitoes.<ref name="pmid16033124"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Insect Repellents|url=http://dermnetnz.org/treatments/insect-repellents.html |publisher=DermNet NZ|accessdate=1 July 2011|date=5 July 2010}}</ref> Moreover, some manufacturers of "mosquito repelling" ultrasonic devices have been found to be fraudulent,<ref>[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2002/08/lentek.htm Lentek International-08/28/02]</ref> and their devices were deemed "useless" in tests by the UK Consumer magazine ''[[Which?]]'',<ref name="Which">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-361429/The-great-mosquito-sting.html|title=The great mosquito sting|year=6 Sept 2005|accessdate=2010-11-27 | location=London | work=Daily Mail | date=2005-09-06}}</ref> and according to a review of scientific studies.<ref>Enayati AA, Hemingway J, Garner P., “Electronic mosquito repellents for preventing mosquito bites and malaria infection”, ''Cochrane Database Syst Rev.,''  2007 18; CD005434</ref>
