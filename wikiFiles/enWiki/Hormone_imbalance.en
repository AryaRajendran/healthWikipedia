Hormones are the chemical messengers in the body that travel the bloodstream to the [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. They slowly work and affect many of the body's processes over time. [[Endocrine gland|Endocrine glands]], which are special groups of [[cell (biology)|cells]], make hormones. <ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hormones.html Hormones Overview] Medline Plus. Retrieved on 2010-01-26</ref>

There are many endocrine glands in the body with the main ones being the [[pituitary gland]], [[thyroid]], [[thymus]], [[adrenal gland|adrenal glands]], and the [[pancreas]]. Hormones are dominant and it only requires a small amount of them to cause significant changes throughout the body. Both men and women produce hormones in the same areas with one exception, the sexual organs. Additional male hormones are produced in the [[testicle|testes]] while women's are produced in the [[ovary|ovaries]].

If hormone imbalance is left untreated it can result in serious medical conditions like [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]. If the imbalance is taking place in the pituitary glands, growth disorders are possible and will require treatment of a growth hormone. It is possible that the imbalance could also cause an overproduction of growth hormones and cause medical conditions such as [[gigantism]] and [[acromegaly]]. There are approximately 6,000 [[endocrine system|endocrine]] disorders that result because of hormone imbalance.
An imbalance of hormones is experienced at different times during life. As the body changes from childhood to adulthood, puberty is experienced by both male and females. Women will then again experience a change later in life after their childbearing years have been passed. Hormonal imbalance is defined as chemical messengers which regulate our body's systems and that are no longer functioning properly. <ref>[http://www.steadyhealth.com/Endometriosis_20___What_Exhibits_Hormonal_Imbalance_to_Cause_Endometriosis__t198433.html Hormonal Imbalance to Cause Endometriosis] Steady Health Portal. Retrieved on 2010-01-26</ref>This dysfunction can be an overproduction or an underproduction of specific hormones. The primary hormone that causes these changes is [[estrogen]].

==Estrogen and progesterone==

A hormonal imbalance occurs as a reaction to the elevated level of estrogen and lowered level of [[progesterone]] within a woman's body.  Estrogen is naturally produced by the ovaries and is the female hormone necessary for normal sexual development. It also works to regulate the menstrual cycle to prepare and maintain the body during childbearing years. Estrogen is dominant during the [[follicular phase]] of the menstrual cycle. Progesterone is dominant during the [[luteal phase]] of the menstrual cycle by the [[corpus luteum]], and is needed for implantation of the fertilized egg. Later in life, the ovaries begin to decrease their production of estrogen and progesterone, causing symptoms of hormone imbalance to develop. Estrogen replacement therapy is a common treatment for hormone imbalance. Frequently, only estrogen is replaced. Some health care providers, especially alternative medicine practitioners, feel it is important to supplement progesterone as well, as the balance between estrogen and progesterone is important. [[Estrogen dominance]], in which there is too much estrogen relative to progesterone, can cause infertility, PMS, menstrual problems, abdominal weight gain, and possibly increased risk of breast cancer.

==Causes==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=September 2012}}

There are multiple causes for hormone imbalance, but the majority of cases are experienced due to estrogen dominance or increased amounts of estrogen in the body and not enough of progesterone. Common causes include birth control pills, [[stress (biology)|stress]], overuse of cosmetics, and non organic animal products. Other medical causes include [[genetics]], obesity, and tumors. Other causes include lack of exercise, [[pregnancy]], [[lactation]], [[autoantibody]] production, and a [[sedentary lifestyle]]. Of all of these causes, obesity is the number one medical cause for hormone imbalance while pregnancy is the number one lifestyle change that causes the condition.

==Symptoms==
Some of the symptoms experienced during hormone imbalance are shared by male and female, while some are more specific to each gender. Some of the most commonly shared symptoms include [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], skin problems or [[acne vulgaris|acne]], mood swings, weight problems, diminished sex drive, and no memory. If the reactions become more severe then we run into actual hormone allergy where we find a group of more serious disorders. <ref>[http://www.onlineallergycenter.com/treatments/hormone_imbalance.htm Hormonal Imbalance Allergy] Roby Institute. Retrieved on 2010-01-26</ref> The disorders include [[arthritis]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[fibromyalgia]], and anxiety attacks. The presence of [[urinary tract infection|urinary tract infections]], increased dryness in the mouth, eyes, genitalia, or abnormal [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]] can also be experienced. The majority of these symptoms are experienced due to menopause.

==Menopause==
Menopause is the permanent end of [[menstrual cycle|menstruation]] and [[fertility]], defined as occurring 12 months after your last menstrual period.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/menopause/DS00119 Menopause Overview] Mayo Clinic. Retrieved on 2010-01-26</ref> It is the time in a woman's life when the ovaries stop producing eggs and the body doesn't produce the same amount of progesterone or estrogen. Menstruation is less frequent and eventually stops altogether. It is a [[biology|biological]] process that is natural and is not a medical illness. Hormonal imbalance is the cause for the physical and emotional experiences associated with menopause. These symptoms include hot flushes, broken sleep patterns or insomnia, and changes in sexual response.
There is no need for prevention of menopause, but there are steps that can be taken to prevent specific side effects. Regular exercise, [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] supplements, a [[low-fat diet]], and controlling [[blood pressure]] and cholesterol levels are recommended.

==Treatment for hormone imbalance==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=September 2012}}
It is important to understand all the risks and benefits of [[hormone replacement therapy]] (HRT). Patients with a history of active or past [[breast cancer]], [[thrombus|blood clots]], liver disease, pregnancy, or [[endometrial cancer]] should talk with a physician before using an over the counter or prescription therapy.
There are two main types of HRT. The first is estrogen replacement. It is available in tablet form, cream, or a patch. It is administered alone and is given in the lowest dose possible to relieve symptoms. The second type of therapy is a combination of estrogen and progesterone. It is commonly known as HRT combination therapy. These two hormones are given continuously for the shortest time possible to reduce the risk for possible side effects. Side effects of treatment include irregular spotting, breast tenderness, fluid retention, headaches, dizziness, and blood clots or [[stroke]].

==Alternatives to HRT==

Patients that are worried about these side effects can use natural products that can be bought over the counter. Diet and exercise have also been proven effective against the symptoms of menopause. As the body goes through these changes, adjusting diet and a person's level of activity will promote healthy bones and reduce the risk of heart disease as well.

==Improper use of hormones==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=September 2012}}
A dangerous or fatal hormone imbalance can occur in those who use [[anabolic steroid|anabolic steroids]]. While the endocrine system is developing, use of these hormones can result in a hormone imbalance that causes an increase in aggressive behavior, mood swings, or developmental disorders. Steroid use is required for some patients, but should only be administered and taken under the care of a health professional to reduce these risks.
