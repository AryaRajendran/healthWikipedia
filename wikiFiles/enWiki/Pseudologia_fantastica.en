'''Pseudologia fantastica''', '''mythomania''', '''compulsive lying''', or '''pathological lying''' are four of several terms applied by [[psychiatrist]]s to the behavior of habitual or compulsive [[lie|lying]].<ref name=jaapl>{{cite journal |author=Dike CC, Baranoski M, Griffith EE |title=Pathological lying revisited |journal=The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=342–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16186198 |url=http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16186198}}</ref><ref name=Dike>{{cite journal |first=Charles C. |last=Dike |date=June 1, 2008 |title=Pathological Lying: Symptom or Disease? |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1162950 |volume=25 |issue=7}}</ref> It was first described in the medical literature in 1891 by Anton Delbrueck.<ref name=Dike/> Although it is a controversial topic,<ref name=Dike/> pathological lying has been defined as "falsification entirely disproportionate to any discernible end in view, may be extensive and very complicated, and may manifest over a period of years or even a lifetime".<ref name=jaapl/> The individual may be aware they are lying, or may believe they are telling the truth, being unaware that they are relating fantasies. 

==Epidemiology==
Although little has been written about pathological lying, one study found a prevalence of almost 1 in 1,000 repeat juvenile offenders. The average age of onset is 16 years, and its occurrence was found by the study to be equal in women and men.<ref name="King BH, Ford CV 1988 1–6">{{cite journal |author=King BH, Ford CV |title=Pseudologia fantastica |journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |year=1988 |month=January |pmid=3279719 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1988.tb05068.x}}</ref> Forty percent of cases reported central nervous system abnormality<ref name="King BH, Ford CV 1988 1–6"/> (characterized by epilepsy, abnormal EEG findings, head trauma, or [[List of infections of the central nervous system|CNS infection]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Characteristics==
The defining characteristics of pseudologia fantastica are: 
# The stories told are not entirely improbable and often have some element of truth. They are not a manifestation of [[delusion]] or some broader type of [[psychosis]]: upon confrontation, the teller can admit them to be untrue, even if unwillingly.
# The fabricative tendency is long lasting; it is not provoked by the immediate situation or social pressure as much as it is an innate trait of the personality. 
# A definitely internal, not an external, motive for the behavior can be discerned clinically: e.g., long-lasting extortion or habitual spousal battery might cause a person to lie repeatedly, without the lying being a pathological symptom.<ref name=Dike/> 
# The stories told tend toward presenting the liar favorably. For example, the person might be presented as being fantastically brave, knowing or being related to many famous people.

Pseudologia fantastica may also present as [[false memory syndrome]], where the sufferer genuinely believes that fictitious events have taken place, regardless that these events are fantasies. The sufferer may believe that he or she has committed superhuman acts of altruism and love or has committed equally grandiose acts of diabolical evil, for which the sufferer must atone, or has already atoned for in her/his fantasies.

==Pathological liars==
Lying is the act of both knowingly and intentionally/willfully making a false statement.<ref>Lying. (n.d.). Dictionary.com Unabridged.

New York: HarperCollins.</ref> Pathological lying is considered a mental illness, because it takes over rational judgment and progresses into the fantasy world and back.<ref>Dike, C., Baranoski, M., & Griffith, E.

Excessive lying is a common symptom of several mental illnesses. For instance people who suffer from [[antisocial personality disorder]] use lying to benefit from others. Some individuals with [[borderline personality disorder]] lie for attention by claiming they’ve been treated poorly (though it is not diagnostic).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Birch, S., Kelln, B. & Aquino, E. |title=A review and case report of pseudologia fantastica |journal=The Journal of Forensic Psychiatry & Psychology |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=299–320 |year=2006 |url=http://psicodiagnosticoudla.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/21007521_pseudology.pdf}}</ref> Pathological lying, on the other hand, can be described as an addiction to lying. It is when an individual consistently lies for no personal gain. The lies are commonly transparent and often seem rather pointless.<ref>Healy, M., & Healy, W. (2004). Pathological lying, Accusation And Swindling. Winnetka, Illinois: Kessinger Publishing.</ref> 

There are many consequences of being a pathological liar. Due to lack of trust, most pathological liars' relationships and friendships fail. If the disease continues to progress, lying could become so severe as to cause legal problems, including but not limited to fraud.<ref name="Dike, C. 2008">Dike, C. (2008). Pathological lying: symptom or disease? Lying with no apparent motive or benefit. Psychiatric Times, 25(7), 67–73. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.</ref> 

Psychotherapy appears to be one of the only methods to treat a person suffering from pathological lying. No research has been performed regarding the use of pharmaceutical medication to treat pathological liars.<ref name="Dike, C. 2008"/> Some research suggests that certain people may have a “predisposition to lying”.<ref>{{cite web |author=Yang, Y., Raine, A., Narr, K., Lencz, T., LaCasse, L. Colleti, P., Toga, A. |date=2007, February |title=Localisation of increased prefrontal white matter in pathological liars |publisher=British Journal of Psychiatry, 190, 174–175 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2376803/pdf/nihms46904.pdf}}</ref>

Pathological lying is a complex phenomenon, differing from other mental illnesses. It has many life-changing consequences for those who must live with the illness. Currently, there is not enough research in the area of pathological lying to guarantee a cure.<ref name="Dike, C. 2008"/>
