==Biography==
Anita L. Allen, also known as Anita Lafrance Allen-Castellitto, was born in [[Fort Worden]] ([[Port Townsend, Washington]]) in 1953. Her parents, Carrye Mae Allen (née Cloud) and Grover Cleveland Allen were both natives of [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Allen's father made a career in the [[United States Army]], serving in both the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. Her father was a member of "Operation Kapers," a squad of enlisted men who entertained combat soldiers in Korea with song, dance and comedy. Allen spent her childhood living on military bases, including [[Fort Benning]], Georgia and [[Schofield Barracks]], Hawaii.

Allen was one of six children. Her brother, Michael Patrick Allen, began working as an environmental lawyer for [[Microsoft]] in 2008. Other siblings are Cynthia Ann Allen Jackson and Monica Lynne Allen Newell, both of whom have worked for the federal government, Newell for the [[Centers for Disease Control]]; Grover Cleveland Allen, Jr, a professional engineer employed by the [[General Electrics|GE corporation]]; and Andre Ramon Allen, who made a career as a Master Sergeant in the [[United States Air Force]] and later became a paralegal. 

In 1985, Allen married Paul Vincent Castellitto, a lawyer from [[New Rochelle, New York]] who specialized in white collar criminal defense law. The pair adopted two children.  An earlier marriage in 1982 to artist Michael Kelly Williams of [[Detroit, Michigan]] ended in divorce. Allen was the model for William's woodcut, "Afternoon of a Georgia Faun," which began as a collage of the same name. An original version of the woodcut was printed at the acclaimed Printmaking Workshop of [[Robert Blackburn (artist)|Robert Blackburn]] and now resides in the permanent print collection of the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, D.C. 

In 2006, Allen became an elder of the [[Bryn Mawr Presbyterian Church]].

Allen's experiences and perspectives have been profiled in a number of books, including [[Laurel Holliday]]’s, ''Children of the Dream'' (2000), [[Ellis Cose]]'s, ''The Rage of a Privileged Class'' (1994), [[George Yancy]]'s ''African American Philosophers: 17 Conversations'' (1998) and [[Elwood Watson]]: ''Outsiders Within'' (2008). She was featured in [[Carlin Romano]]'s article, “A Challenge for Philosophy." Of her, he writes, "Penn’s Anita Allen is at the top of her field, but she has serious concerns about its lack of openness and diversity," ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', October 24, 2007.

President Barack Obama appointed Allen to the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues in  2010.

==Education==
Allen graduated an honor student from [[Baker High School (Columbus, Georgia)|Baker High School]] in [[Columbus, Georgia]] in 1970 in just three years. Allen holds a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[New College of Florida]], on whose board of trustees she later served. Allen has twice delivered the commencement address at New College. While enrolled at New College, Allen spent a year studying in Italy and Germany. Under the direction of Professor [[Bryan Norton]], she completed an undergraduate thesis on the philosophy of logical positivist [[Rudolf Carnap]]. Allen received her [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in philosophy from the [[University of Michigan]]. Allen received training in analytic philosophy at the University of Michigan, where she also studied modern dance, alongside classmate [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. Professor [[Richard Brandt]], a noted proponent of moral utilitarianism, advised Allen's doctoral thesis, "Rights, Children and Education."  Her dissertation examined Thomas Hobbes' and John Locke's theories of parental authority, and the moral ideal of a right to education. She argued for greater autonomy for children. Allen was one of the first African American women to earn a PhD in Philosophy, along with [[Joyce Mitchell Cook]], [[LaVerne Shelton]], and [[Adrian Piper]].  She is the first African American woman in history to hold both a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] and Ph.D. in philosophy. Allen received her J.D. from [[Harvard Law School]]. While attending Harvard Allen served as a teaching fellow for Professors [[Michael Sandel]], [[Ronald Dworkin]], [[Robert Nozick]] and [[Sissela Bok]].
