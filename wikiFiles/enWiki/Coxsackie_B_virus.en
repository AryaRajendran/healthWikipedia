'''Coxsackie B''' is the name of a group of six serotypes of [[pathogenic]] [[enteroviruses]] that trigger illness ranging from mild gastrointestinal distress to full-fledged [[pericarditis]] and [[myocarditis]].<ref name="Fields Virology"> {{cite book

==Geographic distribution==
The various members of the Coxsackie B group were discovered almost entirely in the United States, appearing originally in [[Connecticut]], [[Ohio]], [[New York]], and [[Kentucky]], although a sixth member of the group has been found in the [[Philippines]].<ref name="Fields Virology" />  That said, all six serotypes have a global distribution and are a relatively common cause of gastrointestinal upset.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of infection with viruses in the Coxsackie B grouping include [[fever]], [[headache]], [[sore throat]], gastrointestinal distress, as well as [[chest pain|chest]] and [[muscle pain]].  This presentation is known as [[Bornholm disease|pleurodynia]] or Bornholm disease in many areas.  Sufferers of chest pain should see a doctor immediately - in some cases, viruses in the Coxsackie B family progress to myocarditis or pericarditis, which can result in permanent heart damage or death.  Coxsackie B virus infection may also induce [[aseptic meningitis]].  As a group, they are the most common cause of unexpected [[Sudden cardiac death|sudden death]], and may account for up to 50% of such cases.<ref>{{cite journal

Infection usually occurs between the months of June and October in temperate Northern Hemisphere regions.<ref name="Fields Virology" />

==Diagnosis==
Enterovirus infection is diagnosed mainly via [[serological]] tests such as [[ELISA]]<ref>{{cite journal

==Viral structure and function==
Coxsackie B viruses are single-strand positive-sense [[RNA viruses]] that are resistant to a wide variety of chemical treatments.  The viral particles themselves are roughly 30&nbsp;nm [[icosahedron]]s.<ref>{{cite web

Coxsackie B viruses are [[cytolytic]], and Coxsackie B2 and B5 viruses have been implicated in [[hand, foot and mouth disease]] as well as respiratory infection.<ref name="Fields Virology" />  Infection in infants is mostly asymptomatic, but sometimes results in the death of the infant, often due to myocarditis.<ref>{{cite journal

==Diabetes==
{{main|Coxsackie B4 virus}}
The B4 strain of Coxsackie viruses has been discovered to be a possible cause of [[Diabetes mellitus type 1]].

==Treatment and prevention==
{{As of|2008}}, there is no well-accepted treatment for the Coxsackie B group of viruses.<ref name="Fields Virology" />  [[Palliative care]] is available, however, and patients suffering chest pain or stiffness of the neck should be examined for signs of cardiac or [[central nervous system]] involvement, respectively.  Some measure of prevention can usually be achieved by basic sanitation on the part of food-service workers, though the viruses are highly contagious.  Care should be taken in washing ones hands and in cleaning the body after swimming.  In the event of Coxsackie-induced myocarditis or pericarditis, [[antiinflammatory|antiinflammatories]] can be given to reduce damage to the heart muscle.
