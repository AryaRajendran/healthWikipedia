'''Robert Merritt Chanock''' (July 8, 1924 &ndash; July 30, 2010) was an American [[pediatrics|pediatrician]] and [[virology|virologist]] who made major contributions to the prevention and treatment of childhood respiratory infections in more than 50 years spent at the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]].

Chanock was born July 8, 1924 in [[Chicago]]. His post-secondary plans were to study physics. When he was drafted by the [[United States Army]] in 1943, he was given the choice of attending medical school with his course of study paid for by the military or going to the front lines. Chanock passed the entrance examination and graduated from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1945 and the [[Pritzker School of Medicine|University of Chicago School of Medicine]] in 1947.<ref name=NYTObit/><ref name=NAIAD>[http://web.archive.org/web/20061001201924/http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/labs/aboutlabs/lid/respiratoryVirusesSection/chanock.htm Robert M.

After completing his medical training, he did a [[fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] [[Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center|Cincinnati's Children's Hospital]], where he worked under [[Albert Sabin]], who called Chanock his "star scientific son." <ref name=WPObit>Brown, Emma.

Accessed August 9, 2010.</ref> He was drafted by the Army in 1952 and was sent to [[Korea]] to help deal with an outbreak of [[Japanese encephalitis]], but a [[appendicitis|ruptured appendix]] forced him to [[Tokyo]], where he did research on [[infectious disease]]. He returned to Children's Hospital after being released from Army duty, and later did research at the [[University of Cincinnati]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]].<ref name=NYTObit/>

He joined the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, where he discovered the [[human respiratory syncytial virus]], which is the cause of respiratory tract infections in children each winter, and is one of the most common causes of illness.<ref name=NYTObit/> Asked the best means to prevent the disease, Chanock quipped "one thing you can tell them is to have their babies in the spring".<ref name=WPObit/> A research team led by Chanock announced in 1962 the discovery that one of the causes of [[atypical pneumonia]] is ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'', a bacterium that can be treated with antibiotics. Chanock was named head of the NIAID's Laboratory of Infectious Diseases in 1968. Researchers working with Chanock developed vaccines to prevent [[Adenoviridae|adenovirus infection]], [[Hepatitis A]] and [[rotavirus]], the most common cause of severe [[diarrhoea]] in infants and young children, as well as an influenza virus vaccine in the form of a [[nasal spray]]. Efforts were underway to create a vaccine to deal with [[dengue fever]], though efforts to create immunizations for para-influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus were unsuccessful.<ref name=NYTObit/>

Chanock was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] in 1973.<ref name=NYTObit/> He was also honored with the [[Robert Koch Prize]], the [[Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal]], the [[E. Mead Johnson Award]], the Public Health Service's Meritorious Service Medal and Distinguished Service Medal.<ref name=WPObit/>

NIAID Director Dr. [[Anthony Fauci]] called Chanock "an outstanding scientist whose innumerable contributions to the understanding of viral diseases helped make the world a healthier place for millions of people".<ref>[[Anthony Fauci|Fauci, Anthony]].

A resident of [[Bethesda, Maryland]], Chanock died at age 86 on July 30, 2010, at an [[assisted living]] facility in [[Sykesville, Maryland]], due to complications of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. He was survived by a son and four grandchildren.<ref name=NYTObit/>
