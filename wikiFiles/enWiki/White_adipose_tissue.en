'''White adipose tissue''' ('''WAT''') or '''white fat''' is one of the two types of [[adipose tissue]] found in mammals.  The other kind of adipose tissue is [[brown adipose tissue]].  

In healthy, non-overweight humans, white adipose tissue composes as much as 20% of the body weight in men and 25% of the body weight in women. Its cells contain a single large fat droplet, which forces the nucleus to be squeezed into a thin rim at the periphery. They have receptors for [[insulin]], [[growth hormones]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[glucocorticoids]].

White adipose tissue is used as a store of energy. Upon release of insulin from the pancreas, white adipose cells' insulin receptors cause a dephosphorylation cascade that lead to the inactivation of hormone-sensitive [[lipase]]. It was previously thought that upon release of [[glucagon]] from the [[pancreas]], glucagon receptors cause a phosphorylation cascade that activates hormone-sensitive lipase, causing the breakdown of the stored fat to [[fatty acids]], which are exported into the blood and bound to [[albumin]], and [[glycerol]], which is exported into the blood freely.There is actually no evidence at present that glucagon has any effect on white adipose tissue.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gravholt|first=C H|title=Physiological levels of glucagon do not influence lipolysis in abdominal adipose tissue as assessed by microdialysis|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11344211}}</ref> [[Glucagon]] is now thought to act exclusively on the liver to trigger [[glycogenolysis]] and [[gluconeogenesis]].<ref name="Lawrence1969">{{Cite pmid|4893399}}</ref> The trigger for this process in white adipose tissue is instead now thought to be [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH), [[adrenaline]] and [[noradrenaline]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}. Fatty acids are taken up by muscle and cardiac tissue as a fuel source, and glycerol is taken up by the liver for gluconeogenesis.

White adipose tissue also acts as a thermal insulator, helping to maintain body temperature.

The hormone [[leptin]] is primarily manufactured in the adipocytes of white adipose tissue.
