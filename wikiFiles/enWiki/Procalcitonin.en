'''Procalcitonin''' (PCT) is a [[peptide]] [[protein precursor|precursor]] of the hormone [[calcitonin]], the latter being involved with [[calcium]] [[homeostasis]]. It is composed of 116 [[amino acid]]s and is produced by [[parafollicular cell]]s (C cells) of the [[thyroid]] and by the [[neuroendocrine cell]]s of the lung and the intestine. 

The level of procalcitonin in the blood stream of healthy individuals is below the limit of detection (10 pg/mL) of clinical assays.<ref name="pmid7989463">{{cite journal

}}</ref> The level of procalcitonin rises in a response to a proinflammatory stimulus, especially of [[bacterium|bacterial]] origin. In this case, it is produced mainly by the cells of the lung and the intestine. It does not rise significantly with viral or non-infectious inflammations. With the derangements that a severe [[infection]] with an associated systemic response brings, the blood levels of procalcitonin may rise to 100&nbsp;mcg/L. In serum, procalcitonin has a half-life of 25 to 30 hours. Remarkably the high procalcitonin levels produced during infections are not followed by a parallel increase in calcitonin or serum calcium levels.

==Uses==
===Diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis===
Measurement of procalcitonin can be used as a marker of severe [[sepsis]] caused by bacteria and generally grades well with the degree of sepsis,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Meisner M, Tschaikowsky K, Palmaers T, Schmidt J |title=Comparison of procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma concentrations at different SOFA scores during the course of sepsis and MODS |journal=Crit Care |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=45–50 |year=1999 |pmid=11056723 |pmc=29013 |url=http://ccforum.com/content/3/1/45 |doi=10.1186/cc306}}</ref> although levels of procalcitonin in the [[blood]] are very low. PCT has the greatest [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] (85%) and [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] (91%) for differentiating patients with [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]] (SIRS) from those with sepsis, when compared with [[Interleukin 2|IL-2]], [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]], [[Interleukin 8|IL-8]], [[C-reactive protein|CRP]] and [[TNF-alpha]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=BalcI C, Sungurtekin H, Gürses E, Sungurtekin U, Kaptanoglu B |title=Usefulness of procalcitonin for diagnosis of sepsis in the intensive care unit |journal=Crit Care |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=85–90 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12617745 |pmc=154110 |url=http://ccforum.com/content/7/1/85 |doi=10.1186/cc1843}}</ref> Evidence is emerging that procalcitonin levels can reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing to people with [[lower respiratory tract infection]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=JAMA|doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1297

A meta-analysis reported a [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] of 76% and [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] of 70%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jones AE, Fiechtl JF, Brown MD, Ballew JJ, Kline JA |title=Procalcitonin test in the diagnosis of bacteremia: a meta-analysis |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=34–41 |year=2007 |pmid=17161501 |doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2006.10.020}}</ref>

===Prognosis of pneumonia===
A [[cluster randomized trial]] found that the procalcitonin level can help guide antibiotic therapy. In this trial, "on the basis of serum procalcitonin concentrations, use of antibiotics was more or less discouraged (<0.1 mcg/L or <0.25 mcg/L) or encouraged (> or =0.5 mcg/L or > or =0.25 mcg/L), respectively".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Christ-Crain M, Jaccard-Stolz D, Bingisser R, Gencay MM, Huber PR, Tamm M, Müller B |title=Effect of procalcitonin-guided treatment on antibiotic use and outcome in lower respiratory tract infections: cluster-randomised, single-blinded intervention trial |journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9409 |pages=600–7 |year=2004 |pmid=14987884 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15591-8}}</ref> However, an earlier nonrandomized, observational study reported "limited, prognostic value" of procalcitonin measurement.<ref name="pmid11952722">{{cite journal |author=Brunkhorst FM, Al-Nawas B, Krummenauer F, Forycki ZF, Shah PM |title=Procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and APACHE II score for risk evaluation in patients with severe pneumonia |journal=Clin.

Procalcitonin levels may be useful to distinguish bacterial infections from nonbacterial infections. Trials from 2008 and 2009 have shown that they may help guide therapy and reduce antibiotic use, which can help save on cost of antibiotic prescriptions and drug resistance.<ref>Schuetz P, Christ-Crain M, Thomann R, et al.
