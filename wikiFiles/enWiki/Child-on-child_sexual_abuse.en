'''Child-on-child sexual abuse''' refers to a form of [[child sexual abuse]] in which a prepubescent child is sexually abused by one or more other children or [[Adolescence|adolescent]] youths, and in which no adult is directly involved. The term has been defined as [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] between children that occurs "without consent, without [[Human rights|equality]], or as a result of [[coercion]]".<ref name="shaw"/> This includes when one of the children uses physical force, threats, trickery or [[psychological manipulation|emotional manipulation]] to elicit cooperation.  Child-on-child sexual abuse is further differentiated from normative sexual play or anatomical curiosity and exploration (i.e. "[[playing doctor]]") because of overt and deliberate actions directed at sexual stimulation or orgasm.<ref name="loseke">{{cite book   | last = Loseke | first = Donileen R. | coauthors =  Gelles, Richard J.  and Cavanaugh, Mary M.

When sexual abuse is perpetrated by one sibling upon another, it is known as "[[intersibling abuse]]".<ref name="Caffaroa">{{cite journal|title=Treating sibling abuse families|author=John V.

==Etiology==
In the [[etiology]] of child-on-child sexual abuse, young children who have not matured sexually are incapable of knowing about specific sex acts without an external source.<ref name="pinsky" /><ref name=Bromberg/><ref name=gray2>{{cite journal | pmid=10391518 |doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(99)00027-7| year=1999 | last1=Gray | first1=A | last2=Pithers | first2=WD | last3=Busconi | first3=A | last4=Houchens | first4=P | title=Developmental and etiological characteristics of children with sexual behavior problems: Treatment implications | volume=23 | issue=6 | pages=601–21 | journal=Child abuse & neglect }}</ref> Consequently, children who initiate or solicit overtly sexual acts with other children most often have been sexually [[victimized]] by an adult beforehand,<ref name="pinsky">[[Drew Pinsky|Drew Pinsky, MD]] and [[Stryker (disc jockey)|Ted Stryker]] (November 5, 2007) [http://fetch.noxsolutions.com/loveline/mp3/loveline_20071105_low.mp3/ "Loveline"] (audio interview, 0:38:45-0:40:31).

==Prevalence==
The incidence of child-on-child sexual abuse is not known with any certainty, similar to abuse by adults.  It frequently goes unreported because it is not widely known of in the public,<ref name="loseke" /> and often occurs outside of adults' supervision. Even if known by adults, it is sometimes dismissed as harmless by those who do not understand the implications.<ref name="loseke" /> In particular, intersibling abuse is under-reported relative to the reporting rates for parent-child sexual abuse,<ref name="Caffaroa"/> and disclosure of the [[incest]] by the victim during childhood is rare.<ref name="Carlson ">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1300/J070v15n04_02 | title = Sibling Incest: Reports from Forty-One Survivors | year = 2006 | last1 = Carlson | first1 = Bonnie E. | last2 = MacIol | first2 = Katherine | last3 = Schneider | first3 = Joanne | journal = Journal of Child Sexual Abuse | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 19–34 | pmid = 17200052 }}</ref>

==Effects==
Children who were sexually victimized by other minors, including inter-sibling abuse, show largely the same problems as children victimized by adults, including [[anxiety disorders]], [[clinical depression|depression]], [[substance abuse]], [[suicide]], [[eating disorder]]s, [[post traumatic stress disorder]], [[sleep disorders]] and difficulty trusting peers in the context of relationships.<ref name="shaw">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0145-2134(00)00212-X | title = Child on child sexual abuse: Psychological perspectives | year = 2000 | last1 = Shaw | first1 = J | journal = Child Abuse & Neglect | volume = 24 | issue = 12 | pages = 1591–1600 | pmid=11197037}}</ref><ref name="Rudd">{{cite journal|title=Brother-sister incest—father-daughter incest: a comparison of characteristics and consequences |author=Jane M.

Major factors that affect the severity of symptoms include the use of force or coercion, the frequency of the abuse, and the invasiveness of the act.<ref>Brown, Janelle C., Ph.D. (September, 2004).
