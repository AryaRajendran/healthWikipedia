'''Epididymitis''' ({{Audio-IPA|Epidimitis.ogg|ˌɛpɪˌdɪdəˈmaɪtɪs|lang=English|help=no}}, {{USdict|ěp'ĭ-dĭd'ə-mī'tĭs|}}, {{Respell|EP|ə|DID|ə|MEYE|tis}}) is a medical condition characterized by discomfort or pain in of the [[epididymis]], a curved structure at the back of the [[testicle]] in which [[sperm]] matures and is stored.  Epididymitis is usually characterized as either ''acute'' or ''chronic'': if acute, the onset of testicular pain is often accompanied by inflammation, redness, and warmth in the [[scrotum]]; if chronic, pain may be the only symptom. In either form, testicular pain in one or both testes can vary from mild to severe, and one or both epididymides may noticeably swell and/ or harden.  The pain is often cyclical and may last from less than an hour to several days.<ref>{{Cite book

Epididymitis is the most frequent cause of [[acute scrotum|acute onset scrotal pain]] in adults. In contrast with men that have [[testicular torsion]], the [[cremasteric reflex]] (elevation of the testicle in response to stroking the upper inner thigh) is not altered. If the diagnosis is not entirely clear from the patient's [[Medical history|history]] and [[physical examination]], a [[Doppler ultrasound|Doppler ultrasound scan]] can confirm increased flow of blood to the affected epididymis (whereas torsion is characterized by [[ischemia]]).  If the inflammation spreads to the testicle, the condition may be reclassified as '''epididymo-[[orchitis]]''' or '''orchiepididymitis'''.

The swelling from epididymitis may stretch along the [[inguinal canal]] and may appear similar to that of a [[hernia]], particularly an [[inguinal hernia]].  It may be distinguished from these, however, in that with the exception of an incarcerated indirect inguinal hernia, inguinal hernias generally are not painful, and the swelling they produce often disappears upon lying down.  Neither is the case with epididymitis.  Also, hernias are not episodic, whereas epididymitis frequently is.

==Classification==
Epididymitis can be classified as acute, subacute, and chronic, depending on the duration of symptoms.<ref name=AMP09>{{cite journal |author=Trojian TH, Lishnak TS, Heiman D |title=Epididymitis and orchitis: an overview |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=79 |issue=7 |pages=583–7 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19378875 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Chronic epididymitis===
Chronic epididymitis is epididymitis that ensues for more than six weeks. Chronic epididymitis is characterized by [[inflammation]] even when there is no [[infection]] present. Tests are needed to distinguish chronic epididymitis from a range of other disorders that can cause constant scrotal pain including [[testicular cancer]] (though this is often painless), enlarged scrotal veins ([[varicocele]]), and a [[cyst]] within the [[epididymis]]. Some research has found that as much as 80% of visits to a urologist for scrotal pain are for chronic epididymitis.<ref name=kav>{{Cite book

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:SOA-epididymites.jpg|thumb|Swelling in a patient with epididymitis]]
The mean age of patients who present with epididymitis is 41.  The acute form develops over the course of several days, with pain and swelling frequently in only one testis, which will hang low in the scrotum.<ref name=brown/>  There will often be a history of [[dysuria]] or [[urethra|urethral discharge]].<ref name=brown/>  Fever is also a common symptom.  In the chronic version, the patient can have painful point tenderness but may or may not have an irregular epididymis upon [[palpation]], though palpation may reveal an unusually firm epididymis.  A scrotal ultrasound may reveal problems with the epididymis, but such an ultrasound may also show nothing unusual.  The majority of patients with chronic epididymis have had symptoms for over five years.<ref name=kav/>{{rp|p.311}}

== Causes ==
Though urinary tract infections in men are rare, bacterial infection is the most common cause of acute epididymitis.<ref name=AMP09/> The [[bacteria]] in the [[urethra]] back-track through the [[urinary tract|urinary]] and [[human reproductive system|reproductive structures]] to the epididymis. There can be associated [[urethritis]] (inflammation of the urethra). In rare circumstances, the infection reaches the epididymis via the bloodstream.

In sexually active men, ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'' is responsible for two-thirds of acute cases, followed by ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'' and ''[[E. coli]]'' (or other bacteria that cause [[urinary tract infection]]). Particularly among men over age 35 in whom the cause is ''E. coli'', epididymitis is commonly due to urinary tract obstruction.<ref name=brown>{{Cite book

''E. coli'' is more common in boys before [[puberty]], the [[elderly]], and [[homosexual men|men who have sex with men]].  In the majority of cases in which bacteria are the cause, only one side of the scrotum or the other is the locus of pain.<ref>{{Cite book

Non-infectious causes are also possible. Reflux of sterile urine (urine without bacteria) through the [[ejaculatory duct]]s may cause inflammation with obstruction. In children, it may be a response following an infection with [[enterovirus]], [[adenovirus]] or ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]''.  Rare non-infectious causes of chronic epididymitis include [[sarcoidosis]] (more prevalent in black men) and [[Behçet's disease]].<ref name=kav/>{{rp|p.311}}

Any form of epididymitis can be caused by genito-urinary [[surgery]], including [[prostatectomy]] and  [[urinary catheterization]]. [[Congestive epididymitis]] is a long-term complication of [[vasectomy]].<ref name="pmid10785217">{{cite journal |author=Schwingl PJ, Guess HA |title=Safety and effectiveness of vasectomy |journal=Fertil.

==Diagnosis==
Epididymitis can be hard to distinguish from [[testicular torsion]]. Both can occur at the same time. A [[urologist]] may need to be consulted.

Epididymitis usually has a gradual onset. On [[physical examination]], the testicle is usually found to be in its normal vertical position, of equal size compared to its counterpart, and not high-riding. Typical findings are redness, warmth and swelling of the scrotum, with tenderness behind the testicle, away from the middle (this is the normal position of the epididymis relative to the testicle). The [[cremasteric reflex]] (if it was normal before) remains normal. This is a useful sign to distinguish it from [[testicular torsion]]. If there is pain relieved by elevation of the testicle, this is called [[Prehn's sign]], which is, however, non-specific.

[[Urinalysis|Analysis of the urine]] may or may not be normal. Before the advent of sophisticated [[medical imaging]] techniques, surgical exploration was the standard of care. Nowadays, [[Doppler ultrasound]] is a common test: it can demonstrate areas of blood flow and can distinguish clearly between epididymitis and torsion.  However, inasmuch as torsion and other sources of testicular pain can consistently be determined by palpation alone, some studies have suggested that the only real benefit of an ultrasound is to assure the patient that he does not have cancer.<ref name=baran>{{Cite book

}}</ref>{{rp|p.237}} [[Nuclear medicine|Nuclear]] testicular blood flow testing is rarely used.

Additional tests may be necessary to identify underlying causes. In younger children, a urinary tract anomaly is frequently found. In sexually active men, tests for [[sexually transmitted disease]]s may be done. These may include [[microscopy]] and [[Microbiological culture|culture]] of a first void urine sample, [[Gram stain]] and culture of fluid or a swab from the [[urethra]], [[nucleic acid amplification test]]s (to amplify and detect microbial [[DNA]] or other [[nucleic acid]]s) or tests for [[syphilis]] and [[HIV]].

==Treatment==
In the acute form, [[antibiotics]] are used if an infection is suspected.  The treatment of choice is often [[azithromycin]] and [[cefixime]] to cover both gonorrhoeae and chlamydia.  [[Fluoroquinolone]]s are no longer recommended due to widespread resistance of gonorrhoeae to this class.<ref name="Smith"/>  [[Doxycycline]] may be used as an alternative to azithromycin.

For cases caused by enteric organisms (such as ''E. coli''), [[ofloxacin]] or [[levofloxacin]] are recommended.<ref name="Smith"/>

In children, fluoroquinolones and doxycycline are best avoided. Since bacteria that cause urinary tract infections are often the cause of epididymitis in children, [[co-trimoxazole]] or suited [[penicillin]]s (for example, [[cephalexin]]) can be used.

Household remedies such as elevation of the [[scrotum]] and cold compresses applied regularly to the [[scrotum]] may relieve the pain. [[Painkillers]] or [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs|anti-inflammatory drugs]] are often necessary. Hospitalisation is indicated for severe cases, and check-ups can ensure the infection has cleared up. Surgical removal of the epididymis is rarely necessary, causes sterility, and only gives relief from pain in approximately 50% of cases.<ref name=nickel/>

It is generally believed that most cases of chronic epididymitis will eventually "burn out" of patient's system if left untreated, though this might take years or even decades.<ref name=nickel>{{Cite book

==Complications==
Untreated, acute epididymitis's major complications are [[abscess]] formation and testicular [[infarction]].  Chronic  epididymitis can lead to permanent damage or even destruction of the epididymis and testicle (resulting in infertility and/or [[hypogonadism]]), and infection may spread to any other [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] or system of the body.  Chronic pain is also an associated complication for untreated chronic epididymitis.<ref name=nickel/>

==Epidemiology==
Epididymitis makes up 1 in 144 outpatient visits (0.69 percent) in men 18 to 50 years old or 600,000 cases in men between 18 to 35 in the United States.<ref name=AMP09/>

It occurs primarily in those 16 to 30 years of age and 51 to 70 years.<ref name=AMP09/>  As of 2008 there appears to be an increase in incidences in the United States that parallels an increase in reported cases of [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] and [[gonorrhea]].<ref name="Smith">{{cite journal |author=Smith DM|title=A Really Big Pain: Acute Epididymitis |journal=The AIDS Reader |date=September 1, 2008|url=http://www.consultantlive.com/pain/article/1145619/1361797}}</ref>
