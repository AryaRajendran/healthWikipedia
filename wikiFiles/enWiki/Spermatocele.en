'''Spermatocele''' ({{IPAc-en|s|p|ɜr|ˈ|m|æ|t|ə|s|iː|l}}<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/spermatocele Entry "spermatocele"] in ''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]''.</ref><ref>''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989.</ref>) is a [[retention]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}} [[cyst]] of a [[tubule]] of the [[rete testis]] or the head of the [[epididymis]] distended with barely watery fluid that contains [[spermatozoa]]. Spermatoceles are the most common [[cyst]]ic condition encountered within the [[scrotum]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} They vary in size from several millimeters to many centimeters.  Spermatoceles are generally not painful.  However, some men may experience discomfort from larger spermatoceles. They are harmless.

==Aetiology==
#Spermatoceles can originate as [[diverticulum]] from the [[tubules]] found in the head of the [[epididymis]].  [[Spermatozoon|Sperm]] formation gradually causes the [[diverticulum]] to increase in size, causing a spermatocele.  They are due to continuity between the epididymis and [[tunica vaginalis]].
#They are also believed to result from [[epididymitis]] or [[physical trauma]]. [[Scar]]ring, of any part of the [[epididymis]], can cause it to become obstructed and may form a spermatocele.  It can also result from vasectomy.

==Diagnosis==

Spermatoceles can be discovered as incidental scrotal masses found on physical examination by a [[physician]]. They may also be discovered by self-inspection of the [[scrotum]] and [[testicles]].

Finding a painless, [[cyst]]ic mass at the head of the [[epididymis]], that [[transilluminate]]s and can be clearly differentiated from the [[testicle]], is generally sufficient. If uncertainty exists, [[ultrasonography]] of the [[scrotum]] can confirm if it is spermatocele.

If an individual finds what they suspect to be a spermatocele, they are advised to consult a [[urologist]].

==Treatment==
Small [[cyst]]s are best left alone, as are larger [[cyst]]s that are an [[asymptomatic condition]].  Only when the [[cyst]]s are causing discomfort and are enlarging in size, or the patient wants the spermatocele removed, should a [[spermatocelectomy]] be considered.  Pain may persist even after removal.

[[Spermatocelectomy]] can be performed on an outpatient basis, with the use of local or general [[anesthesia]].

A [[spermatocelectomy]] will not improve [[fertility]].
