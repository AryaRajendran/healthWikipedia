An '''epinephrine autoinjector''' is a medical device used to deliver a measured dose (or doses) of [[epinephrine]] (also known as adrenaline) using [[autoinjector]] technology, most frequently for the treatment of acute [[allergic reaction]]s to avoid or treat the onset of [[anaphylactic shock]].

Trade names for this device include '''EpiPen''', '''Twinject''', '''Adrenaclick''', '''Anapen''', '''Jext''', '''Allerject''', and '''Auvi-Q'''. The EpiPen was originally derived from the [[Mark I NAAK|ComboPen]], a product developed for the military for treating exposure to nerve agents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/epipen-inventor-helped-millions-and-died-in-obscurity/1038756 |title=EpiPen inventor helped millions and died in obscurity |first=Kevin |last=Smetana |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=September 24, 2009 |accessdate=2010-07-07}}</ref>

== Design ==

The devices contain a spring-loaded needle that exits the tip of the device (in some cases through a sterile membrane) and penetrates the recipient's skin, to deliver the medication via [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]] or [[intramuscular injection]]. 

Epinephrine autoinjectors contain a pre-determined dose of epinephrine, usually between 300&nbsp;μg<ref name=epipen/><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Lincoln Medical Ltd|url=http://www.anapen.co.uk/downloads/SUMMARY%20OF%20PRODUCT%20CHARACTERISTICS%20ANAPEN%20300.doc|title=Anapen 300 product information sheet}}</ref> and 500&nbsp;μg<ref name=epipen/><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Lincoln Medical Ltd|url=http://www.anapen.co.uk/downloads/SUMMARY%20OF%20PRODUCT%20CHARACTERISTICS%20ANAPEN%20500.doc|title=Anapen 500 product information sheet}}</ref> of active ingredient at a concentration of 1:1000.  They typically contain more medication than the amount needed for a single dose, but any extra amount is not intended for use and is inaccessible without destroying the device.  Manufacturers have also made [[Pediatrics|pediatric]] dosed versions available at 150&nbsp;μg of active ingredient,<ref name=epipen>{{cite web|url=http://www.epipen.com/epipen_dosing.aspx |title=Epipen and Epipen Jr; Dosing &#124; Epinephrine Dose &#124; Anaphylaxis |publisher=EpiPen |date= |accessdate=2010-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Lincoln Medical Ltd|url=http://www.anapen.co.uk/downloads/SUMMARY%20OF%20PRODUCT%20CHARACTERISTICS%20ANAPEN%20150.doc|title=Anapen 150 product information sheet}}</ref> and there is also a version which contains two individual doses (in case a repeated application is required) sold under the trade name Twinject.<ref>[http://www.veruspharm.com/news_releases_08_16_2005.htm Verus Pharmaceuticals Announces U.S. Launch of Twinject for Anaphylaxis]</ref>

On August 13, 2012, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved a new version of epinephrine auto-injector made by Intelliject and [[Sanofi]] called the Auvi-Q.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sanofi Announces FDA Approval for Auvi-Q|url=http://en.sanofi.com/Images/30999_20120813_EAI_FDA_APPROVAL_en.pdf|accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref>  It is rectangular in shape, 3.5 inches by 2 inches by 0.5 inch. It has a soundchip in it to give audio cues to a patient or caregiver to aid in the proper use of the device.<ref>{{cite web|title=Auvi-Q Fact Sheet|url=http://www.multivu.com/assets/57459/documents/Auvi-Q-Fact-Sheet-original.pdf|accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref> 

In most countries,  epinephrine is a [[prescription drug]], and therefore obtaining the device requires a [[medical prescription|prescription]] from a [[physician|doctor]].  However, in some jurisdictions, epinephrine autoinjectors are an [[over-the-counter drug]] and may be purchased from a pharmacy counter.

== Usage ==

After activation the patient holds the device in place for 10 seconds as the epinephrine is delivered. This gives the drug enough time to be absorbed by the body's [[muscle]]s and diffused into the bloodstream. Using the device [[intravenously]] is highly discouraged, and can even be lethal as epinephrine is a local [[Vasoconstriction|vascular constrictor]], and used intravenously can restrict blood flow to the area of the injection site, causing subsequent damage to extremities. Additionally, intravenous administration of the epinephrine can cause [[ventricular tachycardia]], or dangerously rapid heartbeat.<ref>http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/326/7389/589</ref> After administering the device, patients are advised to seek immediate medical attention.

== Effectiveness ==

None of these devices prevent future episodes of anaphylaxis, but patients who experience severe or life-threatening reactions may be treated with a series of allergy injections composed of increasing concentrations of naturally occurring substances such as venom to provide excellent and usually lifelong protections against adverse effects of future insect stings: the initial injections have a very low concentration, usually 1 [[Parts-per notation#Parts-per expressions|ppb]] or less.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Resiman |first=R |title=Insect Stings |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=26 |year=1994 |month=August |pages=523–7 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199408253310808 |pmid=8041420 }}</ref>
