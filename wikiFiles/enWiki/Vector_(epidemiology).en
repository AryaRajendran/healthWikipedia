In [[epidemiology]], a '''vector''' is any agent (person, animal or [[microorganism]]) that carries and transmits an infectious [[pathogen]] into another living organism.<ref>[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=vector WordNet Search]</ref><ref name="Epi dictionary Last 2001">{{Cite book | editor1-last=Last | editor1-first=James | title = A Dictionary of Epidemiology | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2001 | location = New York | page = 185 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=RPaQY8cG4N4C&lpg=PP1&dq=editions%3AISBN0195314492&client=firefox-a&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=&f=false | isbn = 978-0-19-514169-6 | oclc = 207797812}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Roberts | first1 = Larry S. | first2 = Janovy | last2 = John | first3 = Schmidt | last3 = Gerald D. | title = Foundations of Parasitology | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2008 | oclc = 226356765 | isbn = 978-0-07-302827-9}}</ref>

==Basic concepts==
In the terminology of epidemiology, '''vectors''' are organisms that transmit infections from one [[Host (biology)|host]] to another. Most commonly known biological vectors are [[arthropods]] but many domestic animals too are important vectors or [[asymptomatic carrier]]s of [[parasite]]s and [[pathogen]]s that attack humans or other animals. Some such pathogens and parasites are of great medical or veterinary importance. Many parasites actually are adapted to a particular vector for part of their developmental cycle, but the vector function essentially consists in transmission of the parasite to subsequent [[Host (biology)|hosts]].

The [[concept]] of disease vectors has some commonality with certain other concepts in medicine and veterinary science; it is worth comparing '''vectoring''', '''[[zoonosis]]''' and [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]] for perspective. Zoonosis sometimes arises from purely [[Adventitiousness|adventitious]] or non-systematic transport of the infectious agent. For example a [[housefly]] or a dog might accidentally, but routinely, carry the pathogens of [[typhoid]] or [[cholera]] in external dirt without being in any special way adapted to such a function. Technically such a process amounts to vectoring, and such vectors are important in practice, though they are logically similar to [[airborne disease]] and [[waterborne diseases]]. However, the term ''vector'' commonly, though not necessarily, is used in contexts where the parasite or pathogen is adapted to be dependent on the vector organism for the completion of its life cycle.   

The ecology and principles of disease vectors vary greatly, but some themes occur frequently. For instance, in cases where the pathogen is strictly dependent on the vector (its secondary [[Host (biology)|host]]) and gets only one chance at transmission, it commonly is adapted to avoid causing the rapid death, or often even any significant reduction of the vigour of the vector. In contrast there are plenty of examples of where the [[Host (biology)|primary host]] is uncompromisingly sacrificed in a [[parasitoid]]al process.

==Arthropods==
[[File:Adult deer tick(cropped).jpg|thumb|left|180px|The deer tick, a vector for lyme disease.]]
[[Arthropod]]s form a major group of disease vectors with mosquitoes, flies, sand flies, lice, fleas, ticks and mites transmitting a huge number of diseases.  Many such vectors are [[haematophagous]], which feed on blood at some or all stages of their lives. When the insects blood feed, the parasite enters the blood stream of the host. This can happen in different ways. 

The ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito, a vector for [[Malaria]], [[Filariasis]] and various arthropod-borne-viruses ([[Arbovirus infection|arboviruses]]), inserts its delicate mouthpart under the skin and feeds on its host's blood. The parasites the mosquito carries are usually located in its salivary glands (used by mosquitoes to anaesthetise the host). Therefore, the parasites are transmitted directly into the host's blood stream. Pool feeders such as the [[Phlebotominae|sand fly]] and [[black fly]], vectors for [[Leishmaniasis]] and [[Onchocerciasis]] respectively, will chew a well in the host's skin, forming a small pool of blood from which they feed. ''[[Leishmania]]'' parasites then infect the host through the saliva of the sand fly. [[Onchocerca]] force their own way out of the insect's head into the pool of blood. 

[[Triatominae|Triatomine bugs]] are responsible for the transmission of a [[Trypanosoma|trypanosome]], ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'', which causes Chagas Disease. The Triatomine bugs defecate during feeding and the excrement contains the parasites which are accidentally smeared into the open wound by the host responding to pain and irritation from the bite.
