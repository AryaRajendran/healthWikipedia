The diarrhetic syndromes observed in patients are thought to stem from the three toxins [[Hemolysin BL]] Hbl, [[Nonhemolytic Enterotoxin]] Nhe and [[Cytotoxin K]] CytK.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Guinebretière MH, Broussolle V, Nguyen-The C |title=Enterotoxigenic Profiles of Food-Poisoning and Food-Borne Bacillus cereus Strains |journal=J.

Transcription of these genes is controlled by PlcR. These genes occur as well in the toxonomically related ''B. thuringensis'' and ''B. anthracis''. These enterotoxins are all produced in the small intestine of the host, thus thwarting the issue of digestion by host endogenous enzymes. The Hbl and Nhe toxins are pore-forming toxins closely related to [[ClyA]] of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''. The proteins exhibit a conformation known as "beta-barrel" that can insert into cellular membranes due to a [[hydrophobic]] exterior, thus creating pores with [[hydrophilic]] interiors. The effect is loss of cellular [[membrane potential]] and eventually cell death. CytK is a pore-forming protein more related to other hemolysins.

It was previously thought that the timing of the toxin production might be responsible for the two different courses of disease, but in fact the emetic syndrome is caused by a toxin called [[cereulide]] that is found only in emetic strains and is not part of the "standard toolbox" of ''B. cereus''. Cereulide is cyclic polypeptide containing 3 repeats of 4 amino acids: D-Oxy-Le—D-Ala—L-Oxy-Val—L-Va (similar to [[Valinomycin]] produced by ''[[Streptomyces griseus]]'') produced by [[nonribosomal peptide|nonribosomal peptide synthesis (NRPS)]]. Cereulide is believed to bind to 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT3) [[serotonin]] receptors activating them and leading to increased [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] [[vagus nerve stimulation]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Agata N, Ohta M, Mori M, Isobe M | title=A novel dodecadepsipeptide, cereulide, is an emetic toxin of ''Bacillus cereus'' | journal=FEMS Microbiol Lett | year=1995 | pages=17–20 | volume=129 | issue=1 | pmid=7781985 | doi=10.1016/0378-1097(95)00119-P}}</ref>    It was shown independently by two research groups to be encoded on multiple [[plasmid]]s: pCERE01<ref>{{cite journal | author=Hoton FM, Andrup L, Swiecicka I, Mahillon J | title=The cereulide genetic determinants of emetic ''Bacillus cereus'' are plasmid-borne | journal=Microbiology | year=2005 | pages=2121–4 | volume=151 | issue=7 | pmid=16000702 | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.28069-0}}</ref> or pBCE4810.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Ehling-Schulz M, Fricker M, Grallert H, Rieck P, Wagner M, Scherer S | title=Cereulide synthetase gene cluster from emetic ''Bacillus cereus'': Structure and location on a mega virulence plasmid related to Bacillus anthracis toxin plasmid pXO1 | journal=BMC Microbiol | year=2006 | volume=6 | pmid=16512902 | pages = 20 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2180-6-20 | pmc=1459170}}</ref>    Plasmid pBCE4810 shares homology with the ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' virulence plasmid pXO1, which encodes the [[anthrax toxin]].

== Diagnosis ==

In case of [[Foodborne illness]], the diagnosis of ''B. cereus'' can be confirmed by the isolation of more than 10<sup>5</sup> ''B. cereus'' organisms per gram from epidemiologically implicated food, but such testing is often not done because the illness is relatively harmless and usually self-limiting.<ref name=cdc>[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm4310.pdf Bacillus cereus Food Poisoning Associated with Fried Rice at Two Child Day Care Centers] from Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].
