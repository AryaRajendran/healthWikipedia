'''Dilute Russell's viper venom time''' (dRVVT) is a laboratory test often used for detection of [[lupus anticoagulant]] (LA).<ref name="pmid16196459">{{cite journal |author=Moore GW, Tugnait S, Savidge GF |title=A new-generation dilute Russell's viper venom time assay system for lupus anticoagulants: evaluation of detection utilising frozen reagents and controls |journal=Br.

==Mechanism==
This ''in vitro'' diagnostic test is based on the ability of the venom of the [[Daboia|Russell's viper]] to induce [[thrombosis]]. The coagulant in the venom directly activates [[factor X]], which turns [[prothrombin]] into [[thrombin]] in the presence of [[factor V]] and [[phospholipid]]. In the dRVVT assay, low, rate-limiting concentrations of both Russell's viper venom and phospholipid are used to give a standard clotting time of 23 to 27 seconds. This makes the test [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitive]] to the presence of [[lupus anticoagulant]]s, because these antibodies interfere with the clot-promoting role of phospholipid ''in vitro'', and their presence results in a prolonged clotting time. A mixing study is then performed, which consists of adding an equal volume of the patient's plasma to normal plasma. In this study, one would expect the clotting time to return to the normal range if there was only a deficiency of coagulation factors alone. A prolonged clotting time of 30 seconds or greater that does not correct despite the mixing study suggests the presence of a lupus anticoagulant.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thiagarajan P, Pengo V, Shapiro SS |title=The use of the dilute Russell viper venom time for the diagnosis of lupus anticoagulants |journal=Blood |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=869–74 |year=1986 |pmid=3092888 |doi=}}</ref> An abnormal result for the initial dRVVT assay should be followed by a dRVVT confirmatory test.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.hoc.2007.10.009 | last1 = Hoppensteadt | first1 = DA | last2 = Fabbrini | first2 = N | last3 = -1#Bick | first3 = RL.

The clotting times of both the initial dRVVT assay and confirmatory test are normalized and then used to determine a ratio of time without phospholipid excess to time with phospholipid excess. In general, a ratio of greater than 1.2 is considered a positive result and implies that the patient may have antiphospholipid antibodies. The dRVVT test is more sensitive than the [[aPTT]] test for the detection of [[lupus anticoagulant]], because it is not influenced by deficiencies or inhibitors of clotting factors [[Factor VIII|VIII]], [[Factor IX|IX]] or [[Factor XI|XI]].<ref name="SL">[http://www.specialtylabs.com/books/display.asp?id=812 Antiphospholipid Syndrome] at [http://www.specialtylabs.com/ SpecialtyLaboratories].

==Use in diagnosis==
The dRVVT is one component of a workup of a suspected [[Antiphospholipid syndrome|antiphospholipid antibody]], the other component being the [[serological]] testing for [[anticardiolipin antibodies]] and [[anti-β2 glycoprotein-I antibodies]] using [[ELISA]] technology.  The [[Sapporo criteria]] require at least one of the above laboratory tests to be positive and the patient to have at least one clinical manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome such as vascular thrombosis or fetal mortality/morbidity in order to diagnose the antiphospholipid syndrome (also known as [[Hughes syndrome]]).<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2006.01753.x | last1 = Miyakis | first1 = S | last2 = Lockshin | first2 = MD | last3 = -1#Atsumi | first3 = T.

Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is an important marker for recurrent thrombosis, and often warrants indefinite [[anticoagulant]] (blood thinner) therapy.

The criteria were defined in 1999, and revised in 2006.<ref name="pmid17337473">{{cite journal |author=Kaul M, Erkan D, Sammaritano L, Lockshin MD |title=Assessment of the 2006 revised antiphospholipid syndrome classification criteria |journal=Ann.
