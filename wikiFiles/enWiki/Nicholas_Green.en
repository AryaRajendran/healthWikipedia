'''Nicholas Green''' (September 9, 1987 &ndash; October 1, 1994) was an [[United States|American]] boy who was shot and killed in an attempted car robbery while vacationing with his family in Southern [[Italy]]. Robbers mistook their family car for a jeweller's. When Nicholas died, his parents chose to donate his organs. Five people received his major organs, and two received a cornea transplant.<ref name="ItalyMoved">{{Cite news | last = Cowell| first = Alan| title = Italy Moved by Boy's Killing And the Grace of His Parents| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| page = A1 | date = October 4, 1994| url = http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/04/world/italy-moved-by-boy-s-killing-and-the-grace-of-his-parents.html| accessdate = 2010-02-03 }}</ref> The incident is credited with generating a significant increase in the rate of organ donation in Italy.<ref name="Gathering">{{Cite news | last = Parsons| first = Sandra| last2 = Singleton| first2 = Ronald| title = Gathering Of The 'Family' Who Share Boy's Legacy Of Life| newspaper = [[Daily Mail]]| location = London| page = 21| date = February 6, 1995}}</ref>

==Death==
Nicholas Green, his sister, Eleanor Green, and their parents, Margaret and Reginald Green, were having a holiday in [[Calabria]] Southern Italy. On the night of September 29, 1994 his parents were driving on the [[Autostrada A3 (Italy)|A3]] motorway between [[Salerno]] and [[Reggio Calabria]].<ref name="ItalyMoved" /><ref name="AChildsKilling" /> They stopped at an [[Autogrill]], where two men started following their car believing they were jewellers. The men pulled alongside the Greens' vehicle and shouted something in Italian, which the Greens did not understand. Reginald Green accelerated, at which point the men fired shots into the rear of the car. He accelerated a second time, and once again the men shot into the back of the car. After the pursuers gave up Reginald stopped the car, and at this point he and Margaret realised that Nicholas had been shot in the head.<ref name="AChildsKilling">{{Cite news | last = Cowell| first = Alan| title = A Child's Killing Puts Focus on Italy's Roads| newspaper = The New York Times| page = 53 | date = October 23, 1994| url = http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/travel/travel-advisory-correspondent-s-report-child-s-killing-puts-focus-italy-s-roads.html | accessdate = 2010-02-03 }}</ref> They drove directly to the nearest town, but the hospital was not equipped to deal with Nicholas' injuries. The police took the family to [[Villa San Giovanni]], where they transferred to a ferry which brought them across the [[Strait of Messina]] to the port of [[Messina]]. From there, the police took them to a specialist head injuries unit at a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead the next day.<ref name="GangstersShoot">{{Cite news | last = Sparrow| first = Andrew| title = Gangsters Shoot British Boy In Car| newspaper = Daily Mail| location = London | page = 5 | date = October 1, 1994}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
===Family===
In May 1996 the Greens had twins, a girl (Laura) and a boy (Martin). Since their loss, the Greens have been strong supporters of organ donation and they have been traveling throughout the world to spread the message of donation and tell their story.

===Trial===
Following the shooting, Italian police arrested two men on November 2, 1994,Francesco Mesiano and Michele Iannello.<ref name="ItalyDetains">{{Cite news | last = Cowell| first = Alan| title = Italy Detains 2 in Highway Killing of U.S. Boy, 7| newspaper = The New York Times| page = A5 | date = November 2, 1994| url = http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/02/world/italy-detains-2-in-highway-killing-of-us-boy-7.html| accessdate = 2010-02-03 }}</ref> They were tried in [[Catanzaro]] by a court consisting of three judges, and on January 17, 1997 they were found not guilty. Reginald Green had been unable to identify them, as the shooters had both been wearing masks, and it was dark.<ref name="ItalyAcquits">{{Cite news | last = Tagliabue| first = John| title = Italy Acquits 2 in Killing of U.S. Boy Whose Organs Were Donated| newspaper = The New York Times| page = A4 | date = January 17, 1997| url = http://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/17/world/italy-acquits-2-in-killing-of-us-boy-whose-organs-were-donated.html| accessdate = 2010-02-03 }}</ref><ref name="ConvictionsUpheld">{{Cite news | last = Callahan| first = Mary| title = Convictions Upheld In Nicholas Green Case| newspaper = The Press Democrat| location = Santa Rosa, CA, USA| page = B2| date = April 17, 1999}}</ref> However, a year later, with no new evidence, an appellate court with a jury convicted the pair. This decision was upheld by Italy's supreme court in 1999.<ref name="ConvictionsUpheld" />

===Organ Donation===
After Nicholas' death, donation rates increased dramatically in Italy, a country where organ transplants were almost non-existent.<ref name="Gathering"/> Nicholas' name continues to be associated with organ donation, and is acknowledged as the most famous organ donor in the world. The result of his parents' decision has been called "The Nicholas Effect" (l'Effetto Nicholas) and refers not only to organ donation but also to everything good that emerged from the tragedy.<ref name="ItalyAcquits" />

==Memorials==
A memorial bell tower (The Children's Bell Tower) has been built in Bodega Bay in memory of Nicholas Green and all the children, using more than 140 bells sent to the Greens from individuals, families, schools, and churches all over Italy. The monument, set in Bodega Bay, where Nicholas and his family lived, has become a place of pilgrimage as well as a tourist attraction. The central bell, donated by the Marinelli Foundry, that has been making bells for the Papacy for more than 1000 years, was blessed by Pope John Paul II. It has the names of the seven recipients of Nicholas' organs inscribed on it. The monument is a work of San Francisco's sculptor Bruce Hasson.

Another sculpture, called "The Birds", has been donated by the Greens to the Calabria Region and is located at the Regional Council Palace. It depicts seven birds (like Nicholas' organs that were donated and the number of the recipients) made of steel, floating in a sort of tower. Also this monument is work of Bruce Hasson. He used the steel of guns confiscated by San Francisco Police Department.

An educational video has been made out of their story, called 'The Nicholas Effect'. It is currently shown in hospitals all around the United States and is used by procurement organizations, hospitals, churches, to spread a message of solidarity and the importance of donation. It tells the story of Nicholas, how his organs saved the lives of seven very sick Italians, and how this thing changed the attitude of a whole Country towards organ donation.
Since Nicholas died, organ donation rates in Italy have more than tripled, bringing Italy from being at the bottom among European Countries in donation to one of the top of the list (currently Italy is second, after Spain, as far as organ donation rates).

Reginald Green wrote two books: the first called "The Nicholas Effect" (Il Dono di Nicholas, in Italiano) and the second called "The Gift that Heals" (Il Dono che Guarisce, in Italian), published jointly with UNOS (United Network for Organ Sharing) - the non-profit organization that manages the United States's organ transplant system under contract with the federal government.
Both books have been highly acclaimed by media and specialists of organ donation all around the world . They are used in nursing schools, hospitals, churches, since the books are considered a complete and useful work on organ donation.

The Greens established also a Scholarship for primary and middle school children in the United States that every year goes to a student in every State that distinguished himself. The Award is managed by the NAGC (the National Association for Gifted Children).

The World Transplant Game Federation dedicated to Nicholas Green the ski race for transplanted children: it is the "Nicholas Cup". It has been held in Nendaz [[Switzerland]] in 2001, Bormio in Northern [[Italy]] in 2004, [[Poland]] in 2005, and Rovaniemi [[Finland]] in 2008. Next time it will take place in Anzere [[Switzerland]] in March 2012. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wtgf.org/page.asp?section=0001000100160006&sectionTitle=The+Nicholas+Cup |title=The Nicholas Cup |publisher=World Transplant Games Federation|accessdate=2010-02-03}}</ref>

A TV movie, ''Nicholas' Gift'', starring [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] and [[Alan Bates]], was based on the event.<ref name="ABoyIsSlain">{{Cite news| last = Lyman| first = Rick| title = A Boy Is Slain, and Gives Life to Others| newspaper = The New York Times| page = B15 | date = April 25, 1998| url = http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/25/arts/television-review-a-boy-is-slain-and-gives-life-to-others.html| accessdate = 2010-02-03 }}</ref>
