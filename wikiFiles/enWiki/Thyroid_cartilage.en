The '''thyroid cartilage''' is the largest of the nine [[cartilage]]s that make up the ''laryngeal skeleton'', the cartilage structure in and around the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] that contains the [[larynx]]. 

It is composed of two plate-like [[lamina (anatomy)|laminae]] that fuse on the anterior side of the cartilage to form a peak, called the [[laryngeal prominence]]. This prominence is often referred to as the "''pomus Adami''"<ref>[http://tsroadmap.com/physical/face/trachea.html Medical literature]</ref> or "''Adam's apple''". The laryngeal prominence is more prominent in adult male than female because of the difference in the size of the angle: 90° in male and 120° in female.  

The lip of the thyroid cartilage just superior to the laryngeal prominence is called the [[superior thyroid notch]], while the notch inferior to the thyroid angle is called the ''inferior thyroid notch''.

Its posterior border is elongated both inferiorly and superiorly to form the [[superior horn of thyroid cartilage]] and [[inferior horn of thyroid cartilage]].

==Layers and articulations==
The two laminae that make up the main lateral, surfaces of the thyroid cartilage extend obliquely to cover either side of the trachea. The [[oblique line]] marks the superior lateral borders of the [[thyroid gland]].

The posterior edge of each lamina [[joint|articulates]] with the [[cricoid cartilage]] inferiorly at a joint called the [[cricothyroid joint]]. 

Movement of the cartilage at this joint produces a change in tension at the [[vocal cords|vocal folds]], which in turn produces variation in [[phonation|voice]]. 

The entire superior edge of the thyroid cartilage is attached to the [[hyoid bone]] by the [[thyrohyoid membrane]].

==Function==
The thyroid cartilage forms the bulk of the anterior wall of the larynx, and serves to protect the [[vocal folds]] ("vocal cords"), which are located directly behind it. 

It also serves as an attachment for several laryngeal muscles.
