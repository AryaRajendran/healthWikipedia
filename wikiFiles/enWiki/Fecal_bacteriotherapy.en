The procedure involves single to multiple infusions (e.g. by [[enema]]) of bacterial fecal flora originating from a healthy donor.

Donors must be tested for a wide array of bacterial and parasitic infections.<ref name="Bakken" /> The fecal transplant material is then prepared and administered in a clinical environment to ensure that precautions are taken.<ref>Borody TJ, Leis S, Pang G ''et al.'' Fecal Bacteriotherapy in the treatment of recurrent ''Clostridium difficile'' infection. UpToDate</ref> The fecal microbiota infusions can be administered via various routes depending on suitability and ease, although enema infusion is perhaps the simplest. There does not appear to be any significant methodological difference in efficacy between the various routes. Repeat stool testing should be performed on patients to confirm eradication of CDI. In over 370 published reports there has been no reported infection transmission.<ref name="Khoruts">{{cite journal |author=Borody TJ, Khoruts A |title=Fecal microbiota transplantation and emerging applications |journal=Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol |date=20 Dec 2011 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=88–96 |doi=10.1038/nrgastro.2011.244 |pmid=22183182}}</ref>

A modified form of fecal bacteriotherapy (Autologous Restoration of Gastrointestinal Flora - ARGF) that is easier to administer was being developed {{As of|2009|lc=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Martin WJ | title = Encapsulated Medicines for Iatrogenic Diseases | journal = British Patent Application | pages = GB0916335.3| year = 2009}}</ref> An autologous fecal sample, provided by the patient before medical treatment, is stored in a refrigerator. Should the patient subsequently develop ''C. difficile'', the sample is extracted with saline and filtered. The filtrate is freeze-dried and the resulting solid enclosed in enteric-coated capsules. Administration of the capsules will restore the patient's original colonic flora and combat ''C. difficile''.

==Theoretical basis==
The hypothesis behind fecal bacteriotherapy rests on the concept of bacterial interference, i.e. using harmless bacteria to displace [[pathogen]]ic organisms. This approach to combating bacterial infections is not new<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sanders WE, Sanders C | title = Modification of normal flora by antibiotics: effects on individuals and the environment | journal = New Dimensions in Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | pages = 217–241 | year = 1984}}</ref> and has long been used in animals, for example, to prevent salmonellosis in chickens.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nurmi E, Rantala M | title = New aspects of Salmonella infection in broiler production| journal = Nature| volume = 241 | issue = 5386| pages = 210–211| year = 1973| id = | doi = 10.1038/241210a0 | pmid = 4700893 }}</ref> In the case of CDI, the ''C.difficile'' pathogen is identifiable. However in the case of [[pseudomembranous colitis]], whilst ''C. difficile'' is the most common cause, there are other ''C. difficile''-negative [[pseudomembranous colitis]] cases. In patients with relapsing CDI, the mechanism of action may be the restoration of missing components of the flora including ''Bacteroidetes'' and ''Firmicutes''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chang JY, Antopoulos DA, Kalra A, ''et al.'' |title=Decreased diversity of the fecal microbiome in recurrent ''Clostridium difficile''-associated diarrhea |journal=J Infect Dis |year=2008 |volume=197 |page=438 |doi=10.1086/525047 |issue=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Khoruts A, Dicksved J, Jansson JK, ''et al.'' |title=Changes in the composition of the human fecal microbiome after bacteriotherapy for recurrent ''Clostridium difficile''-associated diarrhea |journal=J Clin Gastroenterol |year=2010 |volume=44 |pages=354–360 |pmid=20048681 |issue=5 |doi=10.1097/MCG.0b013e3181c87e02}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Tvede M, Rask-Madsen J |title=Bacteriohterapy for chronic relapsing ''clostridium difficile'' diarrhoea in six patients |journal=Lancet |year=1989 |pages=1156–1160 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(89)92749-9 |volume=333 |issue=8648}}</ref> The introduction of normal flora results in durable implantation of these components.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grehan MJ, Borody TJ, Leis SM, ''et al.'' |title=Durable alteration of the colonic microbiota by the administration of donor fecal flora |journal=J Clin Gastroenterol |year=2010 |volume=44 |pages=551–561 |doi=10.1097/MCG.0b013e3181e5d06b |pmid=20716985 |issue=8}}</ref> Another theoretical mechanism entails the production of antimicrobial agents ([[Bacteriocin]]s) by the introduced colonic flora to eradicate ''C. difficile''. This may be a similar mechanism to that of [[Vancomycin]] which originated from soil bacteria, and ''[[bacillus thuringiensis]]'' which has been proven to produce bacteriocins specific for ''C. difficile''.<ref name="ReaMC2011">{{cite journal |author=Rea MC, Dobson A, O'Sullivan O, Crispie F, Fouhy F, Cotter PD, Shanahan F, Kiely B, Hill C, Ross RP |title=Effect of broad- and narrow-spectrum antimicrobials on ''Clostridium difficile'' and microbial diversity in a model of the distal colon |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |date=15 Mar 2011 |volume=108 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=4639–4644 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1001224107 |pmid=20616009 |pmc=3063588}}</ref> The potential combination of replacement of missing components and production of antimicrobial products manufactured by the incoming flora are likely to be the mechanisms curing CDI. In the case of [[ulcerative colitis]], no single 'culprit' pathogen has been identified in humans. However since ''C. difficile'' colitis responds so well to FMT, it is conceivable that [[ulcerative colitis]] may respond in a similar fashion, where the offending infective agent/s are still unknown. 
It is also possible that an infection persists but cannot be identified as was the case with [[pseudomembranous colitis]] when it was first treated in 1958.<ref name="Eiseman" />

==Benefits==
Benefits of FMT include the restoration of the colonic microbiota to its natural state by replacing missing ''Bacteroidetes'' and ''Firmicutes'' species, eradication of ''C. difficile'', and resolution of clinical symptoms such as diarrhea, cramping and urgency. Antibiotic resistance in CDI is an uncommon event- rather CDI relapses due to the presence of ''C. difficile'' spores.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Best EL, Fawley WN, Parnell P, ''et al.'' |title=The potential for airborne dispersal of ''clostridium difficile'' from symptomatic patients |journal=Clin Infect Dis |year=2010 |volume=50 |issue=11 |pages=1450–1457 |doi=10.1086/652648 |pmid=20415567}}</ref>

Although once considered to be "last resort therapy" by some medical professionals due to its unusual nature and 'invasiveness' compared with antibiotics; perceived potential risk of infection transmission; and lack of Medicare coverage for donor stool, the recent position statement by specialists in infectious diseases and other societies<ref name="Bakken" /> is moving away from FMT as a last-resort treatment and toward acceptance of FMT as standard therapy for relapsing CDI and also Medicare coverage in the United States. Dr Martin Floch, the Editor-In-Chief of the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology, announced in a recent editorial that "FMT using donor stool has arrived as a successful therapy".<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Floch MH |title=Fecal Bacteriotherapy, Fecal Transplant and the Microbiome |journal=J Clin Gastroenterol |year=2010 |volume=44 |issue=8 |pages=529–530 |doi=10.1097/MCG.0b013e3181e1d6e2 |pmid=20601895}}</ref>

Given that antibiotics are the original cause of CDI through their damage of the normal human flora and removal of protective ''Bacteroidetes'' and ''Firmicutes'' species further antibiotic therapy should be avoided. It has now been recommended that endoscopic Fecal Microbiota Transplantation be elevated to first-line treatment for patients with clinical deterioration and severe relapsing ''C. difficile'' infection.<ref name="Brandt" /> The earlier the infusion is initiated, the less likely the patient's condition will deteriorate, thereby preventing the higher mortality rate associated with severely affected patients. Fecal Microbiota Transplantation is being increasingly used in clinical practice and, since complications of FMT are rare, its use is likely to increase.

A 2009 study found that fecal bacteriotherapy has the advantages of being an effective and simple procedure that is more cost-effective than continued antibiotic administration and reduces the incidence of antibiotic resistance.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Bakken JS |title=Fecal bacteriotherapy for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection |journal=Anaerobe |year=2009 |month=Dec |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=285–289 |doi=10.1016/j.anaerobe.2009.09.007 |pmid=19778623}}</ref>  

A randomised study published in the New England Medical Journal in January 2013 reported a 94% cure rate of pseudomembranous colitis caused by ''Clostridium difficile'', by administering fecal microbiota transplant compared to just 31% with vancomycin. The study was stopped prematurely as it was considered unethical not to offer the FMT to all participants of the study due to the outstanding results.<ref name="vanNood2013"/><ref name="KellyCP2013">{{cite journal |author=Kelly CP. Fecal Microbiota Transplantation - An Old Therapy Comes of Age |journal=N Engl J Med |date=16 Jan 2013 |pmid=23323865 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe1214816 |title=Fecal Microbiota Transplantation — an Old Therapy Comes of Age |pages=130116140046009}}</ref>

{{As of|2008|05}}, studies have also shown that FMT can have a positive effect on neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease.<ref name="newscientist" /> While Dr. TJ Borody was experimenting with patients that were afflicted by both CDI and Parkinson's disease, he realized that after fecal therapy the symptoms of Parkinson's in his patients began to decrease; some to the point that the Parkinson's could not be detected by other neurologists. The hypothesis for future studies is that the fluctuation in the body's microbiome done by FMT can also be recreated by adding anti-''Clostridium difficile'' antibodies to the patient's body and this technique shall be used in Dr. Borody's future case studies involving Parkinson's disease.<ref name="Khoruts" />

==History==
The first description of FMT was published in 1958 outlining the successful treatment of four patients with pseudomembranous colitis before ''C. difficile'' was the known cause.<ref name="Eiseman" /> Since that time sporadic cases have appeared in the literature.

At the CDD there were indications that FMT could benefit other conditions including [[ulcerative colitis]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Borody TJ, Warren E, Leis S, ''et al.'' |title=Bacteriotherapy using fecal flora: Toying with human motions |journal=J Clin Gastroenterol |year=2004 |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=475–483 |doi=10.1097/01.mcg.0000128988.13808.dc |pmid=15220681}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Borody TJ, Torres M, Campbell J, ''et al.'' |title=Reversal of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with recurrent fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) |journal=Am J Gastroenterol |year=2011 |volume=106 |page=S352}}</ref> [[autoimmune disorders]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Borody TJ, Campbell J, Torres M, ''et al.'' |title=Reversal of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) with Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) |journal=Am J Gastroenterol |year=2011 |volume=106 |page=S352}}</ref> neurological conditions,<ref name="Borody_a" /> [[obesity]], [[metabolic syndrome]] and [[diabetes]],<ref name="Khoruts" /> and [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref name="newscientist" />

The procedure was performed in an episode of ''Grey's Anatomy'' - In the Midnight Hour, season 5, episode 8 where a woman receives a "poop transplant" from her husband.
