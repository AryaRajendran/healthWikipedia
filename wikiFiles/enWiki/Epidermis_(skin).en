== Structure ==
===Cellular components===
The epidermis is [[avascular]], nourished by [[diffusion]] from the [[dermis]], constituted at 95% of [[keratinocyte]]s<ref name="Rooks" /> but also containing [[melanocyte]]s, [[Langerhans cell]]s, [[Merkel cell]]s,<ref name="Andrews" /> and inflammatory cells.  ''Rete ridges'' ("rete tips"<ref>http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/120/3/324.pdf</ref>) are epidermal thickenings that extend downward between [[dermal papillae]].<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/rete+ridge TheFreeDictionary &gt; rete ridge] Citing: The American Heritage Medical Dictionary Copyright 2007, 2004</ref>
[[Blood]] [[capillaries]] are found beneath the epidermis, and are linked to an [[arteriole]] and a [[venule]]. [[Arterial]] shunt [[blood vessel|vessels]] may bypass the network in [[ears]], the [[nose]] and [[fingertips]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Layers===
[[Image:Skinlayers.png|thumb|Schematic image showing a section of epidermis with epidermal layers labeled.]]
The epidermis is composed of 4 or 5 layers depending on the region of [[skin]] being considered.<ref name="ageingskin">[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2011/03/the-ageing-skin-part-1-structure-of-skin-and-introduction/ The Ageing Skin - Structure]</ref>  Those layers in descending order are<ref name="Lookingbill" />: 
* cornified layer (''[[stratum corneum]]'')
::Composed of 10 to 30 layers of polyhedral, anucleated [[corneocyte]]s (final step of [[keratinocyte]] [[cell differentiation|differentiation]]), with the [[Hand#Human_anatomy|palms]] and [[Sole (foot)|soles]] having the most layers. [[Corneocyte]]s are surrounded by a [[protein]] envelope (cornified envelope [[proteins]]), filled with water-retaining [[keratin]] [[proteins]], attached together through [[desmosome|corneodesmosomes]] and surrounded in the [[extracellular]] space by stacked layers of [[lipids]].<ref name="bensouillah">http://www.radcliffe-oxford.com/books/samplechapter/7750/01_bensouillah-241a6c80rdz.pdf</ref> Most of the barrier functions of the epidermis localize to this layer.<ref name="elias">{{cite journal

 | pmid=17621950}}</ref>
* clear/translucent layer (''[[stratum lucidum]]'', only in [[Hand#Human_anatomy|palms]] and [[Sole (foot)|soles]])
* granular layer (''[[stratum granulosum]]'')
::[[Keratinocytes]] lose their [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] and their [[cytoplasm]] appears granular. [[Lipids]], contained into those [[keratinocytes]] within [[lamellar bodies]], are released into the [[extracellular]] space through [[exocytosis]] to form a [[lipid]] barrier. Those polar [[lipids]] are then converted into non-polar [[lipids]] and arranged parallel to the [[cell (biology)|cell]] surface. For example [[glycosphingolipids]] become [[ceramides]] and [[phospholipids]] become [[free fatty acids]].<ref name="bensouillah" />
* spinous layer (''[[stratum spinosum]]'')
::[[Keratinocytes]] become connected through [[desmosomes]] and start produce [[lamellar bodies]], from within the [[golgi apparatus|Golgi]], enriched in polar [[lipids]], [[glycosphingolipids]], free [[sterols]], [[phospholipids]] and catabolic enzymes.<ref name="Proksch" /> [[Langerhans cells]], immunologically active [[cell (biology)|cells]], are located in the middle of this layer.<ref name="bensouillah" />
* basal/germinal layer (''[[stratum germinativum|stratum basale/germinativum]]'').
::Composed mainly of [[cell proliferation|proliferating]] and non-proliferating [[keratinocytes]], attached to the [[basement membrane]] by [[hemidesmosomes]]. [[Melanocytes]] are present, connected to numerous [[keratinocytes]] in this and other strata through [[dendrites]]. [[Merkel cells]] are also found in the [[stratum basale]] with large numbers in touch-sensitive sites such as the [[fingertips]] and [[lip]]s. They are closely associated with cutaneous [[nerves]] and seem to be involved in light touch sensation.<ref name="bensouillah" />

The term [[Malpighian layer]] (''stratum malpighi'') is usually defined as both the [[stratum basale]] and [[stratum spinosum]].<ref name="Rooks" />

The epidermis is separated from the [[dermis]], its underlying [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], by a [[basement membrane]].

===Cellular kinyotics===
====Cell division====
The stratified squamous [[epithelium]] is maintained by [[cell division]] within the [[stratum basale]]. [[cell differentiation|Differentiating]] [[cell (biology)|cell]] delaminate from the [[basement membrane]] and are displaced outwards through the epidermal layers, undergoing multiple stages of [[cell differentiation|differentiation]] until, in the [[stratum corneum]], losing their [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and fusing to squamous sheets, which are eventually shed from the surface ([[desquamation]]). [[cell differentiation|Differentiated]] [[keratinocytes]] secrete [[keratin]] [[proteins]] which contribute to the formation of an [[extracellular matrix]] and is an integral part of the [[skin]] barrier function. In normal [[skin]], the rate of [[keratinocyte]] production equals the rate of loss,<ref name="Rooks" /> taking about two weeks for a [[cell (biology)|cell]] to journey from the [[stratum basale]] to the top of the [[stratum granulosum]], and an additional four weeks to cross the [[stratum corneum]].<ref name="Lookingbill" />  The entire epidermis is replaced by new [[cell (biology)|cell]] [[cell division|growth]] over a period of about 48 days.<ref name="Iizuka">{{cite journal

 | pmid = 7865480 }}</ref>

====Calcium concentration====
[[Keratinocyte]] [[cell differentiation|differentiation]] throughout the epidermis is in part mediated by a [[calcium]] gradient, increasing from the [[stratum basale]] until the outer [[stratum granulosum]], where it reaches its maximum, and decreasing in the [[stratum corneum]]. [[Calcium]] concentration in the [[stratum corneum]] is very low in part because those relatively dry [[cell (biology)|cells]] are not able to dissolve the ions. This [[calcium]] gradient parallels [[keratinocyte]] [[cell differentiation|differentiation]] and as such is considered a key regulator in the formation of the epidermal layers.<ref name="Proksch" /> 

Elevation of [[extracellular]] [[calcium]] concentrations induces an increase in [[intracellular]] free [[calcium]] concentrations.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 2702726 | year = 1989 | last1 = Hennings | first1 = H | last2 = Kruszewski | first2 = FH | last3 = Yuspa | first3 = SH | last4 = Tucker | first4 = RW | title = Intracellular calcium alterations in response to increased external calcium in normal and neoplastic keratinocytes | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 777–80 | journal = Carcinogenesis}}</ref> Part of that [[intracellular]] increase comes from [[calcium]] released from [[intracellular]] stores<ref>{{cite journal | pmid=1990023 | year=1991 | last1=Pillai | first1=S | last2=Bikle | first2=DD | title=Role of intracellular-free calcium in the cornified envelope formation of keratinocytes: Differences in the mode of action of extracellular calcium and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 | volume=146 | issue=1 | pages=94–100 | doi=10.1002/jcp.1041460113 | journal=Journal of cellular physiology}}</ref> and another part comes from transmembrane [[calcium]] influx,<ref>{{cite journal | pmid=    1645742 | year=    1991 | last1=    Reiss | first1=    M | last2=    Lipsey | first2=    LR | last3=    Zhou | first3=    ZL | title=    Extracellular calcium-dependent regulation of transmembrane calcium fluxes in murine keratinocytes | volume=    147 | issue=    2 | pages=    281–91 | doi=    10.1002/jcp.1041470213 | journal=    Journal of cellular physiology}}</ref> through both calcium-sensitive [[chloride channels]]<ref>{{cite journal | pmid=1690740 | year=1990 | last1=Mauro | first1=TM | last2=Pappone | first2=PA | last3=Isseroff | first3=RR | title=Extracellular calcium affects the membrane currents of cultured human keratinocytes | volume=143 | issue=1 | pages=13–20 | doi=10.1002/jcp.1041430103 | journal=Journal of cellular physiology}}</ref> and voltage-independent cation channels permeable to [[calcium]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid=7684087 | year=1993 | last1=Mauro | first1=TM | last2=Isseroff | first2=RR | last3=Lasarow | first3=R | last4=Pappone | first4=PA | title=Ion channels are linked to differentiation in keratinocytes | volume=132 | issue=3 | pages=201–9 | journal=The Journal of membrane biology}}</ref> Moreover, it has been suggested that an [[extracellular]] calcium-sensing [[cell surface receptor|receptor]] (CaSR) also contributes to the rise in [[intracellular]] [[calcium]] concentration.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid=10469331 | year=1999 | last1=Tu | first1=CL | last2=Oda | first2=Y | last3=Bikle | first3=DD | title=Effects of a calcium receptor activator on the cellular response to calcium in human keratinocytes | volume=113 | issue=3 | pages=340–5 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1747.1999.00698.x | journal=The Journal of investigative dermatology}}</ref>

==Organogenesis==
Epidermal [[organogenesis]], the formation of the epidermis, begins in the [[cell (biology)|cells]] covering the [[embryo]] after [[neurulation]], the formation of the [[central nervous system]].  In most [[vertebrates]], this original one-layered structure quickly transforms into a two-layered [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]; a temporary outer layer, the [[periderm]], which is disposed once the inner [[basal layer]] or ''[[stratum germinativum]]'' has formed.

This inner layer is a [[germ layer|germinal epithelium]] that give rise to all epidermal [[cell (biology)|cells]].  It divides to form the outer [[spinous layer]] (''[[stratum spinosum]]'').  The [[cell (biology)|cells]] of these two layers, together called the [[Malpighian layer]](s) after [[Marcello Malpighi]], divide to form the superficial [[granularity|granular]] layer (''[[Stratum granulosum]]'') of the epidermis.  
<ref name="Gilbert-2003" />

The [[cell (biology)|cells]] in the [[stratum granulosum]] do not divide, but instead form [[skin]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] called [[keratinocyte]]s from the [[granule (cell biology)|granule]]s of [[keratin]].  These [[skin]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] finally become the [[cornified layer]] (''[[stratum corneum]]''), the outermost epidermal layer, where the [[cell (biology)|cells]] become flattened sacks with their [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] located at one end of the [[cell (biology)|cell]].  After [[birth]] these outermost [[cell (biology)|cells]] are replaced by new [[cell (biology)|cells]] from the [[stratum granulosum]] and throughout [[life]] they are shed at a rate of {{convert|1.5|g|oz|abbr=on}} per day.
<ref name="Gilbert-2003" />

Epidermal [[developmental biology|development]] is a product of several [[growth factor]]s, two of which are:<ref name="Gilbert-2003" />
* [[Transforming growth factor]] Alpha ([[TGFα]]) is an [[autocrine]] growth factor by which basal [[cell (biology)|cells]] stimulate their own [[cell division|division]].
* [[Keratinocyte growth factor]] (KGF or [[FGF7]]) is a [[paracrine]] growth factor produced by the underlying [[dermis|dermal]] [[fibroblast]]s in which the [[cell proliferation|proliferation]] of basal [[cell (biology)|cells]] is regulated.

==Function==
===Barrier===
The epidermis serves as a barrier to protect the [[body]] against [[microbial]] [[pathogens]], [[oxidant stress]] ([[UV light]]) and [[chemical]] compounds and provides [[mechanics|mechanical]] resistance. Most of that function is played by the [[stratum corneum]].<ref name="elias" />

====Characteristics of the barrier====
* Physical barrier through [[keratinocytes]] attached together via [[cell junctions|cell–cell junctions]] and associated to [[cytoskeletal]] [[proteins]], which gives the epidermis its mechanical strength.<ref name="Proksch" />
* Chemical barrier through the presence of highly organized [[lipids]], [[acids]], hydrolytic [[enzymes]] and [[antimicrobial peptides]].<ref name="Proksch" />
* Immunologically active barrier through [[humoral]] and [[cellular immunity|cellular]] constituents of the [[immune system]].<ref name="Proksch" />
* Water content of the [[stratum corneum]] drops towards the surface, creating hostile conditions for pathogenic [[microorganism]] growth.<ref name="elias" />
* An [[acidic]] [[pH]] (around 5.0) and low amounts of [[water]] make it hostile to many microorganic [[pathogens]].<ref name="elias" />
* The presence of non-pathogenic [[microorganism]] on the epidermis surface help defend against [[pathogenic]] one by limiting [[food]] availability and through chemical [[secretions]].<ref name="elias" />

====Factors that will alter the barrier====
* [[Psychological]] [[stress (psychological)|stress]], through an increase in [[glucocorticoids]], compromises the [[stratum corneum]] and thus the barrier function.<ref>{{cite journal

===Skin hydration===
The ability of the [[skin]] to hold [[water]] is primarily due to the [[stratum corneum]] and is critical for maintaining [[healthy]] [[skin]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid=14938659 | year=1952 | last1=Blank | first1=IH | title=Factors which influence the water content of the stratum corneum | volume=18 | issue=6 | pages=433–40 | journal=The Journal of investigative dermatology}}</ref> [[Lipids]] arranged through a [[gradient]] and in an organized manner between the [[cell (biology)|cells]] of the [[stratum corneum]] form a barrier to [[TEWL|transepidermal water loss]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid=2950180 | year=1987 | last1=Downing | first1=DT | last2=Stewart | first2=ME | last3=Wertz | first3=PW | last4=Colton | first4=SW | last5=Abraham | first5=W | last6=Strauss | first6=JS | title=Skin lipids: An update | volume=88 | issue=3 Suppl | pages=2s–6s | journal=The Journal of investigative dermatology}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid=9049040 | year=1997 | last1=Bonté | first1=F | last2=Saunois | first2=A | last3=Pinguet | first3=P | last4=Meybeck | first4=A | title=Existence of a lipid gradient in the upper stratum corneum and its possible biological significance | volume=289 | issue=2 | pages=78–82 | journal=Archives of dermatological research}}</ref>

===Skin color===
The amount and distribution of [[melanin]] [[pigment]] in the epidermis is the main reason for variation in [[skin color]] in [[Homo sapiens]].  [[Melanin]] is found in the small [[melanosome]]s, particles formed in [[melanocyte]]s from where they are transferred to the surrounding [[keratinocyte]]s.  The size, number, and arrangement of the [[melanosomes]] varies between racial groups, but while the number of [[melanocytes]] can vary between different [[body]] regions, their numbers remain the same in individual [[body]] regions in all [[human]] beings.  In white and oriental [[skin]] the [[melanosomes]] are packed in "aggregates", but in black [[skin]] they are larger and distributed more evenly.  The number of [[melanosomes]] in the [[keratinocytes]] increases with [[UV radiation]] exposure, while their distribution remain largely unaffected.

==Culture==
[[Laboratory]] culture of [[keratinocytes]] to form a 3D structure ([[artificial skin]]) recapitulating most of the properties of the epidermis is routinely used as a tool for [[drug]] development and testing.
