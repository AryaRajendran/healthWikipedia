'''Rodolfo R. Llinás '''  (born 1934) is a [[Colombian people|Colombian]] neuroscientist, and currently the Thomas and Suzanne Murphy Professor of Neuroscience and Chairman of the department of Physiology & Neuroscience at the [[NYU School of Medicine]]. He attended the [[Gimnasio Moderno]] school and received his MD from the [[Pontificia Universidad Javeriana|Universidad Javeriana]], Bogotá in 1959 and his PhD in 1965 from the [[Australian National University]] working under [[Sir John Eccles]]. Llinás has published over 500 scientific articles.

==Early life==
Llinás was born in [[Bogotá]], Colombia.

==Work==
He has studied the electrophysiology of single neurons in the [[cerebellum]], the [[thalamus]], the [[cerebral cortex]], the [[entorhinal cortex]], the [[hippocampus]], the [[vestibular system]], the [[inferior olive]] and the [[spinal cord]]. He has studied synaptic transmitter release in the [[squid giant synapse]]. He has studied human brain function using [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG) on the basis of which he introduced the concept of [[Thalamocortical dysrhythmia]].

==Contributions==
Llinás has written that the brain evolved because organisms needed to move around without running into other organisms or objects.<ref name="grandin121">{{cite book |title= Animals in Translation|last= Grandin|first= Temple|authorlink= Temple Grandin|coauthors= Johnson, Catherine|year= 2005|publisher= Scribner|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-7432-4769-8|page= 121|pages= |url= }}</ref>

Further contributions include:
* Discovery of dendritic inhibition in central neurons (at the mammalian [[motoneuron]]).
* The functional organization of the [[cerebellar cortex]] neuronal circuits.
* Defining cerebellar function from an evolutionary perspective.
* First description of electrical coupling in the mammalian CNS ( [[mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus]])
* First determination of presynaptic calcium current, under voltage clamp, at the [[squid giant synapse]].
* Discovery that vertebrate neurons (cerebellar [[Purkinje cell]])  can generate calcium-dependent spikes .
* Discovery of the [[P-type calcium channel]] in the Purkinje cells.
* Discovery of [[low threshold spikes]] generated by low voltage activated calcium conductaces (presently known as due to [[T-type calcium channel]]) in [[inferior olive]] and [[thalamus]] neurons
* Asserting the law of no interchangeability of neurons, which it is known as  [[Llinás' law]].
* Direct demonstration of [[calcium concentration microdomains]] at the presynaptic active zone.
* Utilization of [[magnetoencephalography]] in clinical research.
* Discovery of [[subthreshold membrane potential oscillations]] in the inferior olive, thalamus and [[entorhinal cortex]].
* The discovery of [[Thalamocortical dysrhythmia]] .
* Artificial olivo-cerebellar motor control system as part of the project BAUV (Undersea Vehicle) of the [[US Navy]] developed by P. Bandyopadhyay.

==Memberships==
Llinás is a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] (1986), the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1996), [[American Philosophical Society]] (1996), the Real Academia Nacional de Medicina (Spain) (1996) and the [[French Academy of Science]] (2002). Dr. Llinás has received [[honorary degree]]s from the following universities:
*[[Universidad de Salamanca]] (Spain) (1985)
*[[Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona]] (Spain) (1993)
*[[National University of Colombia]] (1994)
*[[Universidad Complutense]], Madrid, Spain (1997)
*[[Los Andes University (Colombia)|Universidad de los Andes]], Colombia, (1998)
*Toyama University, Toyama, Japan (2005)
*[[University of Pavia]], Italy (2006)
* Gold Medal of [[CSIC]], Spain (2012)

He was also the chairman of [[NASA]]/Neurolab Science Working Group.
