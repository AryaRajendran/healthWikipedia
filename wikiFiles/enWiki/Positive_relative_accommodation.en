{{context|date=December 2010}}'''Positive relative accommodation''' ('''PRA''') is a measure of the maximum ability to stimulate [[accommodation (eye)|accommodation]] while maintaining clear, single [[binocular vision]].<ref>[http://www.vision-therapy.com/Glossary_of_Terms.htm www.vision-therapy.com]</ref> This measurement is typically obtained by an [[orthoptist]], [[ophthalmologist]] or [[optometrist]] during an [[eye examination]] using a [[phoropter]]. After the patient's distance correction is established, he is instructed to view small letters on a card 40 [[centimeter|cm]] from the [[human eye|eye]]s. The examiner adds lenses in -0.25 increments until the patient first reports that they become blurry. <!--some prefer blur-out, rather than first blur--> The total value of the lenses added to reach this point is the PRA value.

High PRA values (> or = 3.50 [[diopter]]s) are considered to be diagnostic of disorders involving [[accommodative excess]].<ref name="Garcia">Garcia A, Cacho P, Lara F. "Evaluating relative accommodations in general binocular dysfunctions." ''Optom Vis Sci.'' 2002 Dec;79(12):779-87. PMID 12512686.</ref> Those with [[accommodative insufficiency]] typically have PRA values below -1.50 diopters [http://www.aoa.org/documents/CPG-18.pdf].
