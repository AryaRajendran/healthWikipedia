'''Micrognathism''' (or '''Micrognathia''') is a condition where the [[jaw]] is undersized. It is also sometimes called "[[Human mandible|Mandibular]] hypoplasia". {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} It is common in infants,{{fact|date=January 2012}} but is usually self-corrected during growth, due to the jaws increasing in size.  It may be a cause of abnormal tooth alignment and in severe cases can hamper feeding. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} It can also, both in adults and children, make [[intubation]] difficult, either during anesthesia or in emergency situations.

==Causes==
While not always pathological, it can present as a birth defect in multiple syndromes including: [[fetal alcohol syndrome]], [[congenital rubella]], [[DiGeorge's Syndrome]], [[Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome]], [[Pierre Robin syndrome]], [[Hallermann-Streiff syndrome]], [[Trisomy 13]](Patau syndrome), [[Trisomy 18]] (Edwards syndrome), X0 syndrome ([[Turner syndrome]]), [[Noonan syndrome]], [[Prader–Willi_syndrome|Prader-Willi syndrome]], [[Progeria]], [[Treacher Collins syndrome]], [[Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome]], [[Coffin–Lowry syndrome]], [[Russell-Silver syndrome]], [[Seckel syndrome]], [[Juvenile idiopathic arthritis]], [[Cri du chat syndrome]], [[Bloom syndrome]], [[Marfan syndrome]], [[Craniofacial microsomia]] ([[Goldenhar Syndrome]]), and [[Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome]].

==Diagnosis==
It can be detected by the naked eye as well as dental or skull [[X-rays|X-Ray testing]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
