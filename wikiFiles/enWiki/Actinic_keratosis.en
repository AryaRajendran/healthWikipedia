Progressive development of these lesions occurs when skin is exposed to the sun constantly and thick, scaly, or crusty areas appear. The scaly or crusty portion is dry and rough. The lesions start out as flat scaly areas and later grow into a tough, wart-like area.

An [[actinic]] [[keratosis]] site commonly ranges between 2 and 6 millimeters in size, and may be dark or light, tan, pink, red, a combination of all these, or have the same pigment as the surrounding skin. The lesion may appear on any [[sun]]-exposed area, such as the face, ears, neck, scalp, chest, backs of hands, forearms, or lips.

[[File:SkinTumors-P5280064.JPG|thumb|Actinic keratosis, hyperplastic form]]
Actinic keratoses may be divided into the following types:<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>
* Hyperkeratotic actinic keratosis
* Pigmented actinic keratosis
* Lichenoid actinic keratosis
* Atrophic actinic keratosis

* [[Actinic cheilitis]]
* [[Cutaneous horn]]
* [[Squamous cell carcinoma in situ]]

==Incidence==
Actinic keratosis is very common, affecting half of the global population. It is seen more often in fair-skinned individuals, and prevalence may vary with geographical location and age. People who take [[immunosuppressive drugs]], such as organ transplant patients, are 250 times more likely to develop actinic keratoses that may lead to skin cancer.<ref>http://www.clinuvel.com/skin-conditions/skin-cancer/actinic-keratosis</ref>

==Prevention==
Preventive measures recommended for actinic keratosis are similar to those for skin cancer:
* Not staying in the sun for long periods of time without protection (e.g., [[sunscreen]], clothing, hats)
* Frequently applying powerful sunscreens with [[Sun protection factor|SPF]] ratings greater than 30 and that also block both [[Ultraviolet|UVA]] and [[UVB]] light
* Wearing [[sun protective clothing]] such as hats, long-sleeved shirts, long skirts, or trousers
* Avoiding sun exposure during noon hours is very helpful because [[ultraviolet]] light is the most powerful at that time

According to an article in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2005) 125, 93–97; {{doi|10.1111/j.0022-202X.2005.23733.x}}, entitled, "Human Papillomavirus-DNA Loads in Actinic Keratoses Exceed those in Non-Melanoma Skin Cancers", actinic keratosis may contain a significant amount of infectious human papillomavirus. Verbatim: "HPV presents in significantly higher viral loads in actinic keratosis (AK), which are the precursor lesions of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), than in SCC. Viral loads of 1 HPV-DNA copy per less than 50 cells were measured in 40% of AK. The higher viral loads in AK are likely to reflect enhanced HPV-DNA replication. This may be because of intense keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation in AK favoring amplification of commensalic HPV. Active HPV replication and presumably enhanced gene expression may in turn stimulate keratinocyte proliferation and contribute to carcinogenesis in these early stages of NMSC development. HPV-E6 proteins were recently shown to inhibit UV-induced apoptosis by abrogation of Bak in response to UV damage (Jackson and Storey, 2000) and to bind a protein required for repair of single strand DNA breaks (Iftner et al, 2002). Thereby, accumulation of UV-induced mutations and oncogenic transformation might be facilitated in cases of active HPV infection."

==Diagnosis==
Physicians can usually identify actinic keratosis by doing a thorough examination; in principle actinic keratosis is a clinical diagnosis. A [[biopsy]] may be necessary when the keratosis is large or thick, to make sure that the lesion is a keratosis and not a [[skin cancer]]. [[Seborrheic keratosis|Seborrheic keratoses]] are other lesions that appear in groups as the actinic keratosis do, but are not caused by sun exposure, and are not related to skin cancers. Seborrheic keratoses may be mistaken for an actinic keratosis.

===Histopathology===
Actinic keratosis usually shows focal [[parakeratosis]] with associated loss of the granular layer of, and thickening of the epidermis. The normal ordered maturation of the [[keratinocyte]]s is disordered to varying degrees, there may be widening of the intracellular spaces, and they may also have some cytologic atypia, such as abnormally large nuclei.  The underlying [[dermis]] often shows severe [[actinic elastosis]] and a mild [[chronic inflammation|chronic inflammatory]] infiltrate.<ref name=weedon/>

== Treatment ==

Various modalities are employed in the treatment of actinic keratosis:
* [[Ingenol mebutate]] 0.05% and 0.015% gel for treatment of the trunk and extremities or the face and scalp, respectively. Duration of therapy is 2 days for the 0.05% gel and 3 days for the 0.015% gel <ref name="Approved Picato label">[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/202833lbl.pdf Picato Gel label]</ref>
* [[Diclofenac sodium]] 3% gel, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug,<ref name=weedon/> Recommended duration of therapy is 60 to 90 days
* [[Cryosurgery]], e.g. with [[liquid nitrogen]], by "freezing off" the actinic keratosis
* [[5-fluorouracil]] (a [[chemotherapy]] agent): a cream that contains this medication causes actinic keratosis to become red and [[inflamed]] before they fall off
* [[Photodynamic therapy]]:<ref name="pmid18728698">{{cite journal |author=Ericson MB, Wennberg AM, Larkö O |title=Review of photodynamic therapy in actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma |journal=Ther Clin Risk Manag |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18728698 |pmc=2503644 |doi= |url=}}</ref> this new therapy involves injecting a chemical into the bloodstream, which makes the lesions more sensitive to any form of light.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pariser D, Loss R, Jarratt M, ''et al.'' |title=Topical methyl-aminolevulinate photodynamic therapy using red light-emitting diode light for treatment of multiple actinic keratoses: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study |journal=J.

* [[Laser]], notably {{CO2}} and [[Er:YAG]] lasers, a [[Laser resurfacing]] technique is often used with diffuse actinic keratosis
* [[Electrocautery]]: burning off actinic keratosis with electricity
* [[Imiquimod]]<ref name="pmid16557235">{{cite journal |author=Hadley G, Derry S, Moore RA |title=Imiquimod for actinic keratosis: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=J. Invest.

* Different forms of [[surgery]]

Regular follow-up after the treatment is advised by many physicians. The regular checks are to make sure no new lesions have developed and that old ones haven't become thicker.
