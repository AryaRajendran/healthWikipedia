'''Diffuse axonal injury''' (DAI) is one of the most common and devastating types of [[traumatic brain injury]],<ref name="Iwata">Iwata A., Stys P.K., Wolf J.A., Chen X.H., Taylor, A.G., Meaney D.F., and Smith D.H.

==Mechanism==
Unlike [[traumatic brain injury|brain trauma]] that occurs due to direct impact and deformation of the [[brain]], DAI is the result of [[physical trauma|traumatic]] shearing forces that occur when the head is rapidly accelerated or decelerated, as may occur in auto accidents, falls, and assaults.<ref name="Wolf">Wolf J.A., Stys P.K., Lusardi T., Meaney D., and Smith, D.H.

The major cause of damage in DAI is the disruption of [[axons]], the neural processes that allow one [[neuron]] to communicate with another.  Tracts of axons, which appear white due to [[myelin]]ation, are referred to as [[white matter]]. Acceleration causes shearing injury, which refers to damage inflicted as tissue slides over other tissue.  When the brain is accelerated, parts of differing densities and distances from the axis of rotation slide over one another, stretching axons that traverse junctions between areas of different density, especially at junctions between white and [[grey matter]].<ref name="Wasserman"/> Two thirds of DAI lesions occur in areas where grey and white matter meet.<ref name="Wasserman"/>

==Characteristics==
[[Lesion]]s typically exist in the [[white matter]] of brains injured by DAI; these lesions vary in size  from about 1–15&nbsp;mm and are distributed in a characteristic way.<ref name="Wasserman"/>  DAI most commonly affects white matter in areas including the [[brain stem]], the [[corpus callosum]], and the [[cerebral hemisphere]]s.<ref name="VikKvistad"/> The [[lobes of the brain]] most likely to be injured are the frontal and temporal lobes.<ref name="boon">Boon R. and de Montfor G.J. 2002.

===Histological characteristics===
DAI is characterized by axonal separation, in which the axon is torn at the site of stretch and the part [[distal]] to the tear degrades.  While it was once thought that the main cause of axonal separation was tearing due to mechanical forces during the trauma, it is now understood that axons are not typically torn upon impact; rather, secondary [[biochemical cascade]]s, which occur in response to the [[Primary and secondary brain injury|primary injury]] (which occurs as the result of mechanical forces at the moment of trauma) and take place hours to days after the initial injury, are largely responsible for the damage to axons.<ref name="VikKvistad"/><ref name="Wolf"/><ref name="Arundine">Arundine M., Aarts M., Lau A., and Tymianski M. (2004). [http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/24/37/8106 Vulnerability of central neurons to secondary insults after in vitro mechanical stretch].  ''Journal of Neuroscience'' '''24''' (37): 8106—8123.  PMID 15371512. <!--♦♦♦primary♦♦♦--></ref>

Though the processes involved in secondary brain injury are still poorly understood, it is now accepted that stretching of axons during injury causes physical disruption to and [[proteolysis|proteolytic]] degradation of the [[cytoskeleton]].<ref name="Iwata"/> It also opens [[sodium channel]]s in the [[axolemma]], which causes voltage-gated calcium channels to open and Ca<sup>2+</sup> to flow into the cell.<ref name="Iwata"/>  The intracellular presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> unleashes several different pathways, including activating [[phospholipase]]s and proteolytic [[enzymes]], damaging [[mitochondria]] and the cytoskeleton, and activating [[secondary messenger]]s, which can lead to separation of the axon and death of the cell.<ref name="Wolf"/>

===Cytoskeleton disruption===
Axons are normally elastic, but when rapidly stretched they become brittle, and the axonal [[cytoskeleton]] can be broken.  It is thought that [[integrin]]s connected to the [[extracellular matrix]] outside the cell and to the [[cytoskeleton]] within it can transmit forces from the matrix to the cytoskeleton <ref>{{cite journal|last=Hemphill|first=Matthew A.|coauthors=Dabiri, Borna E.; Gabriele, Sylvain; Kerscher, Lucas; Franck, Christian; Goss, Josue A.; Alford, Patrick W.; Parker, Kevin Kit; Wanunu, Meni|title=A Possible Role for Integrin Signaling in Diffuse Axonal Injury|journal=PLoS ONE|date=22 July 2011|volume=6|issue=7|pages=e22899|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022899}}</ref>  and cause the latter to tear when the axon is stretched.<ref name="Ochs">Ochs S., Pourmand R., and Jersild R.A.

'''70''' (4): 1081—1096. PMID 8848169.<!--♦♦♦primary♦♦♦--></ref>

Misalignment of cytoskeletal elements after stretch injury can lead to tearing of the axon and death of the neuron.  [[Axonal transport]] continues up to the point of the break in the cytoskeleton, but no further, leading to a buildup of transport products and local swelling at that point.<ref name="Staal">Staal JA, Dickson TC, Chung RS, Vickers JC. (2007). Cyclosporin-A treatment attenuates delayed cytoskeletal alterations and secondary axotomy following mild axonal stretch injury.  ''Dev Neurobiol''.  '''67''' (14): 1831-42.

===Calcium influx===
While sometimes only the cytoskeleton is disturbed, frequently disruption of the [[axolemma]] occurs as well, causing the influx of [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] into the cell and unleashing a variety of degrading processes.<ref name="Lopachin"/><ref name="Povlishock">Povlishock J.T. and Pettus E.H.

One of the [[protein]]s activated by the presence of [[calcium]] in the cell is [[calpain]], a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent non-[[lysosome|lysosomal]] [[protease]].<ref name="Castillo"/>  About 15 minutes to half an hour after the onset of injury, a process called calpain-mediated spectrin proteolysis, or CMSP, begins to occur.<ref name="Büki">Büki A, Okonkwo D.O., Wang K.K.W., and Povlishock J.T.

Generally occurring one to six hours into the process of post-stretch injury, the presence of calcium in the cell initiates the [[caspase]] cascade, a process in cell injury that usually leads to [[apoptosis]], or "cell suicide".<ref name="Büki"/>  

[[Mitochondria]], [[dendrite]]s, and parts of the [[cytoskeleton]] damaged in the injury have a limited ability to heal and regenerate, a process which occurs over 2 or more weeks.<ref name="Corbo">Corbo J. and Tripathi P. 2004.

==Diagnosis and treatment==
DAI is difficult to detect since it does not show up well on [[CT scan]]s or with other macroscopic imaging techniques, though it shows up microscopically.<ref name="Wasserman"/>  However, there are characteristics typical of DAI that may or may not show up on a CT scan.<ref name="VikKvistad"/> Diffuse injury has more microscopic injury than macroscopic injury and is difficult to detect with CT and MRI, but its presence can be inferred when small bleeds are visible in the [[corpus callosum]] or the [[cerebral cortex]].<ref name="Crooks07">

Thus injury is frequently more severe than is realized, and medical professionals should suspect DAI in any patients whose CT scans appear normal but who have symptoms like [[unconsciousness]].<ref name="Wasserman"/>

[[MRI]] is more sensitive than CT scans,<ref name="VikKvistad"/> but MRI may also miss DAI, because it identifies the injury using signs of [[edema]], which may not be present.<ref name="Corbo"/>  

DAI is classified into grades based on severity of the injury.  In Grade I, widespread axonal damage is present but no focal abnormalities are seen.  In Grade II, damage found in Grade I is present in addition to focal abnormalities, especially in the corpus callosum.  Grade III damage encompasses both Grades I and II plus [[Anatomical terms of location#Directional terms|rostral]] [[brain stem]] injury and often tears in the tissue.<ref name="Bigler">Bigler, E.D. 2000.

DAI currently lacks a specific treatment beyond what is done for any type of [[head injury]], including stabilizing the patient and trying to limit increases in [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP).

==Potential Treatments==

[[Polyethylene glycol]] acts as a membrane sealant, and may serve to prevent the aforementioned devastating calcium influx. Rats treated with polyethylene glycol immediately following DAI induction showed no cytotoxic edema on diffusion weighted MRI 7 days later unlike controls.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Smucker|first1= P|last2= Hekmatyar|first2= SK|last3= Bansal|first3= N|last4= Rodgers|first4= RB|last5= Shapiro|first5= SA|last6= Borgens|first6= RB|title= Intravenous polyethylene glycol successfully treats severe acceleration-induced brain injury in rats as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging.|journal= Neurosurgery|volume= 64|issue= 5|pages= 984–990|year= 2009 |pmid = 19404158|doi= 10.1227/01.NEU.0000342406.43816.13 }}</ref>
