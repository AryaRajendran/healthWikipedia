'''Boutonneuse fever''' (also called '''Mediterranean spotted fever''', '''fièvre boutonneuse''', or '''Marseilles fever''' or ' tick bite fever') is a [[fever]] as a result of a [[Rickettsia]] infection caused by the bacterium ''[[Rickettsia conorii]]'' and transmitted by the dog tick ''[[Rhipicephalus sanguineus]]''. Boutonneuse fever can be seen in many places around the world, although it is endemic in countries surrounding the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. This disease was first described in [[Tunisia]] in 1910 by Conor and Bruch and was named ''boutonneuse'' ([[French language|French]] for "spotty") due to its [[papular]] skin rash characteristics.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Conor, A & A Bruch

==Presentation==
After an incubation period of around seven days, the disease manifests abruptly with chills, high fevers, muscular and articular pains, severe headache and [[photophobia]]. The location of the bite forms a black ulcerous crust (tache noire). Around the fourth day of the illness an [[exanthem]] (widespread rash) appears, first [[macular]] and then [[maculopapular]] and sometimes [[petechial]].

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is made with [[serologic]] methods, either the classic [[Weil-Felix test]] 
([[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] of Proteus OX strains ), [[ELISA]] or [[immunofluorescence]] assays in the bioptic material of the primary lesion.

==Treatment==
The illness can be treated with [[Tetracycline antibiotics|tetracycline]]s ([[doxycycline]] is the preferred treatment), [[chloramphenicol]], [[macrolides]] or [[fluoroquinolones]].
