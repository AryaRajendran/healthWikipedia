'''Hereditary coproporphyria''' (HCP) is a disorder of [[heme]] biosynthesis, classified as an acute hepatic [[porphyria]].<ref name=omim>{{cite web|title= #121300  COPROPORPHYRIA, HEREDITARY;  HCP|url=http://omim.org/entry/121300|accessdate=2012-05-27|publisher=Johns Hopkins University}}</ref>  HCP is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme [[coproporphyrinogen oxidase]], coded for by the ''CPOX'' gene, and is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] fashion, although [[homozygotes|homozygous]] individuals have been identified.  Unlike [[acute intermittent porphyria]], individuals with HCP can present with [[cutaneous]] findings similar to those found in [[porphyria cutanea tarda]] in addition to the acute attacks of abdominal pain, vomiting and neurological dysfunction characteristic of acute porphyrias. Like other porphyrias, attacks of HCP can be induced by certain drugs, environmental stressors or diet changes.  Biochemical and molecular testing can be used to narrow down the diagnosis of a porphyria and identify the specific genetic defect.  Overall, porphyrias are rare diseases.  The combined incidence for all forms of the disease has been estimated at 1:20,000.  The exact incidence of HCP is difficult to determine, due to its reduced [[penetrance]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Clinically, patients affected with HCP present similarly to those with other acute porphyrias, such as [[acute intermittent porphyria]] (AIP) and [[variegate porphyria]] (VP).  Patients with HCP and VP can present with symptoms shared between the acute and cutaneous porphyrias.  This includes the acute attacks of abdominal pain, [[nausea]], vomiting, [[diarrhea]], [[tachycardia]], [[hypertension]] and [[seizures]], as well as the cutaneous findings seen in [[porphyria cutanea tarda]] (PCT), namely increased skin fragility, bullous lesions after exposure to sunlight and increased scarring.<ref name=porphyrinmet>{{cite book |last1=Tortorelli |first1=Silvia |last2=Kloke |first2=Karen M.|last3=Raymond |first3=kimiyo M. |editor1-first=Dennis J|editor1-last=Dietzen |editor2-first=Michael J. |editor2-last=Bennett |editor3-first=Edward C. |editor3-last=Wong |others= |title=Biochemical and Molecular Basis of Pediatric Disease |edition=4th |year=2010 |publisher=AACC Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn= 978-1-59425-100-9 | pages=307–324|chapter=Disorders of Porphyrin Metabolism}}</ref>

Individuals with HCP may be asymptomatic in the absence of triggering factors.  Common triggers include certain drugs, alcohol, hormonal changes, and dietary changes.<ref name=omim /> Sunlight and other ultraviolet light can trigger the skin manifestations.  Homozygous individuals for ''CPOX'' mutations can present with these findings at an earlier age than heterozygotes.<ref name=omim />

==Genetics==
HCP is caused by mutations in the ''CPOX'' gene, which codes for the enzyme [[coproporphyrinogen oxidase]].  This enzyme is responsible for the sixth step in the heme biosynthetic pathway, converting coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX.<ref name=saudubray>{{cite book |last1=Lourenco |first1=Charles Marquez |last2=Lee |first2=Chul |last3=Anderson |first3=Karl E. |editor1-first=Jean-Marie |editor1-last=Saudubray |editor2-first=Georges |editor2-last=van den Berghe |editor3-first=John H. |editor3-last=Walter |others= |title=Inborn Metabolic Diseases:  Diagnosis and Treatment |edition=5th |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn= 978-3-642-15719-6 | pages=521–532 |chapter=Disorders of Haem Biosynthesis}}</ref>   The ''CPOX'' gene is located at [[chromosome 3|3q11.2-q12.1]],<ref name=omim /> has 6 [[intron]]s and 7 [[exons]] and produces an [[mRNA]] strand that is 2675 bases in length.<ref name=genbank>{{cite web|title=Homo sapiens coproporphyrinogen oxidase, mRNA (cDNA clone MGC:19736 IMAGE:3607724), complete cds|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/33991442|accessdate=2012-05-27|publisher=US National Library of Medicine}}</ref>  It is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] fashion, meaning that a deficiency of 50% of the normal enzyme activity is enough to cause symptoms.<ref name=saudubray />  As reproductive fitness is not impacted, [[homozygous]] affected individuals have been reported.<ref name=omim />  Along with other acute porphyrias HCP demonstrates reduced [[penetrance]], meaning not all individuals who carry a disease-causing mutation will express symptoms.<ref name=porphyrinmet /> 

Individuals who are homozygous for a specific mutation (K404E) or compound heterozygous with a [[null allele]] in ''CPOX'' have a more severe erythropoietic porphyria, [[harderoporphyria]],<ref name=harderoporph>{{cite pmid|16159891}}</ref> characterized by neonatal [[jaundice]], [[hyperbilirubinemia]], hepatosplenomegaly and skin lesions upon exposure to ultraviolet light.<ref name=harderocase>{{cite pmid|21103937}}</ref>  HCP is a rare disease, but the exact incidence is difficult to determine due to the reduced [[penetrance]] of the acute porphyrias.  Overall, the incidence of all porphyrias is estimated at 1:20,000 in the United States.<ref name=porphyrinmet />  The incidence of harderoporphyria is even lower, with less than 10 cases reported worldwide.<ref name=omim />

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of any porphyria is often delayed due to the rarity of the disease as well as the varied and non-specific findings that patients present with.  Bedside measurement of urine [[porphobilinogen]] is recommended as a screening test for patients suspected of having an acute porphyria.  Elevated porphobilinogen is indicative of an acute porphyria, and additional testing can be done to narrow down the specific type.<ref name=saudubray /><ref name=acuteporph /> 

The identification of a specific porphyria is based on the results of laboratory findings, including [[blood]], [[urine]] and [[feces|stool]] tests.  HCP can be distinguished from most other acute porphyrias by the cutaneous findings.  VP presents similarly, but can be distinguished based on urine and stool porphyrin analysis, typically done using [[high performance liquid chromatography]] with [[fluorescence]] detection.<ref name=hplcreview>{{cite pmid|7567142}}</ref>  The results of biochemical testing for porphyrias are most informative when samples are collected during an acute attack.<ref name=acuteporph>{{cite pmid|15767622}}</ref>  Typically, the distinguishing metabolite for HCP and VP is the presence of protoporphyrin in the plasma and feces of individuals affected with VP.<ref name=porphyrinmet />

Elevated coproporphyrin is a common finding in urine, known as coproporphyrinuria as it is the predominant porphyrin species in urine.  This is a non-specific finding that is not necessarily due to an acute porphyria.  Coproporphyrinuria can be caused by other stressors to the heme biosynthetic pathway, such as liver disease, lead poisoning and certain [[bone marrow]] disorders.<ref name=copro>{{cite web|title=Tests for Porphyria Diagnosis|url=http://www.porphyriafoundation.com/testing-and-treatment/testing-for-porphyria/tests-for-porphyria-diagnosis|publisher=National Porphyria Foundation|accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
There is no cure for HCP caused by the deficient activity of coproporphyrinogen oxidase.  Treatment of the acute symptoms of HCP is the same as for other acute porphyrias.  Intravenous [[hemin]] (as heme arginate or hematin) is the recommended therapy for acute attacks.<ref name=saudubray /><ref name=acuteporph />  Acute attacks can be severe enough to cause death if not treated quickly and correctly.  Hospitalization is typically required for administration of hemin, and appropriate drug selection is key to avoid exacerbating symptoms with drugs that interact poorly with porphyrias.<ref name=saudubray />  Proper drug selection is most difficult when it comes to treatment of the seizures that can accompany HCP, as most anti-seizure medications can make the symptoms worse.  [[Gabapentin]] and [[levetiracetam]] are two anti-seizure drugs that are thought to be safe.<ref name=saudubray />

In patients where management of symptoms is difficult even with hemin, [[liver transplant]] is an option before the symptoms have progressed to advanced paralysis.  Combined liver and [[kidney]] transplants are sometimes undertaken in patients with renal failure.<ref name=saudubray />

Long term treatment of acute porphyrias is centered around the avoidance of acute attacks by eliminating precipitating factors, such as drugs, dietary changes, and infections.<ref name=acuteporph />  Females often have attacks coincident with their menstrual cycle, which can be managed effectively with hormonal birth control.<ref name=saudubray />  Because of the reduced [[penetrance]] of HCP, family members of a patient may carry the same mutation without ever presenting with symptoms.  Molecular analysis of ''CPOX'' is the best way to identify these patients, as they will not express a biochemical [[phenotype]] on laboratory testing unless they are symptomatic.  Identification of asymptomatic patients allows them to adjust their lifestyle to avoid common triggering factors.<ref name=porphyrinmet /><ref name=acuteporph />
