'''Streptococcal pharyngitis''', '''streptococcal tonsillitis''', or '''streptococcal sore throat''' (known colloquially as '''strep throat''') is a type of [[pharyngitis]] caused by a [[group A streptococcal infection]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/100014400|streptococcal pharyngitis}}</ref> It affects the [[pharynx]] including the [[tonsils]] and possibly the [[larynx]].  Common symptoms include [[fever]], [[sore throat]], and enlarged [[lymph nodes]].  It is the cause of 37% of sore throats among children<ref name=Peds2010/> and 5-15% in adults.<ref name=IDSA2012/>

Strep throat is a contagious infection, spread through close contact with an infected individual.  A definitive diagnosis is made based on the results of a [[throat culture]]. However, this is not always needed as treatment may be decided based on symptoms.  In highly likely or confirmed cases, [[antibiotics]] are useful to both prevent complications and speed recovery.<ref name=Review09/>

==Signs and symptoms==
The typical symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis are a [[sore throat]], [[fever]] of greater than {{convert|38|C|F}}, tonsillar exudates ([[pus]] on the [[tonsils]]), and large [[cervical lymph nodes]].<ref name=Review09>{{cite journal | author = Choby BA | title = Diagnosis and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 79 | issue = 5 | pages = 383–90 | year = 2009 | month = March | pmid = 19275067 | doi =  | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0301/p383.html }}</ref>

Other symptoms include: [[headache]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[abdominal pain]],<ref name=Review06>{{cite journal | author = Brook I, Dohar JE | title = Management of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis in children | journal = J Fam Pract | volume = 55 | issue = 12 |pages = S1–11; quiz S12 | year = 2006 | month = December | pmid = 17137534 | doi =  }}</ref> [[myalgia|muscle pain]],<ref name=Review2001/> or a [[scarlatiniform rash]] or [[palatal petechiae]], the latter being an uncommon but highly [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] finding.<ref name=Review09/> The [[incubation period]] and thus the start of symptoms for strep throat is between one to three days post contact.<ref name=Review09/>  Strep throat is unlikely when any of the symptoms of [[conjunctivitis|red eyes]], hoarseness, runny nose, or mouth ulcers are present. It is also unlikely when there is no fever.<ref name=IDSA2012/>

==Cause==
Strep throat is caused by [[group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus]] (GAS).<ref name=Review10>{{cite journal | author = Baltimore RS | title = Re-evaluation of antibiotic treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis | journal = Curr.

The modified [[Centor criteria]] maybe used to determine the management of people with pharyngitis. Based on 5 clinical criteria, it indicates the probability of a streptococcal infection.<ref name=Review09/>

One point is given for each of the criteria:<ref name=Review09/>
*Absence of a cough
*Swollen and tender cervical lymph nodes
*Temperature >{{convert|38.0|C|F}}
*Tonsillar exudate or swelling
*Age less than 15 (a point is subtracted if age >44)

The [[Infectious Disease Society of America]] however recommends against empirical treatment and considers antibiotics only appropriate following positive testing.<ref name=IDSA2012/> Testing is not needed in children under three as both group A strep and [[rheumatic fever]] are rare, except if they have a sibling with the disease.<ref name=IDSA2012/>

===Laboratory testing===
A [[throat culture]] is the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]]<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Smith, Ellen Reid |author2=Kahan, Scott |author3=Miller, Redonda G. |title=In A Page Signs & Symptoms |series=In a Page Series |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, Maryland |year=2008 |pages=312 |isbn=0-7817-7043-2 |oclc=}}</ref> for the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis with a sensitivity of 90–95%.<ref name=Review09/>  A [[rapid strep test]] (also called rapid antigen detection testing or RADT) may also be used. While the rapid strep test is quicker, it has a lower [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] (70%) and statistically equal [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] (98%) as throat culture.<ref name=Review09/>

A positive throat culture or RADT in association with symptoms establishes a positive diagnosis in those in which the diagnosis is in doubt.<ref name=IDSAGuideline2002/> In adults a negative RADT is sufficient to rule out the diagnosis however in children a throat culture is recommended to confirm the result.<ref name=IDSA2012/> Asymptomatic individuals should not be routinely tested with a throat culture or RADT because a certain percentage of the population persistently "carries" the streptococcal bacteria in their throat without any harmful results.<ref name=IDSAGuideline2002/>

===Differential diagnosis===
{{See also|Acute pharyngitis}}
As the symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis overlap with other conditions it can be difficult to make the diagnosis clinically.<ref name=Review09/>  Coughing, nasal discharge, [[diarrhea]], and [[conjunctivitis|red, irritated eyes]] in addition to fever and sore throat are more indicative of a [[viral sore throat]] than of strep throat.<ref name=Review09/>
The presence of marked lymph node enlargement along with sore throat, fever and tonsillar enlargement may also occur in [[infectious mononucleosis]].<ref name="pmid15508538">{{cite journal | author = Ebell MH | title = Epstein-Barr virus infectious mononucleosis | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 70 | issue = 7 | pages = 1279–87 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15508538 | doi =  | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/20041001/1279.html }}</ref>

==Prevention==
[[Tonsillectomy]] may be a reasonable preventive measure in those with frequent throat infections (more than three a year).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Johnson BC, Alvi A | title = Cost-effective workup for tonsillitis. Testing, treatment, and potential complications | journal = Postgrad Med | volume = 113 | issue = 3 | pages = 115–8, 121 | year = 2003 | month = March | pmid = 12647478 | doi =  }}</ref> The benefits are however small and episodes typically lessen in time regardless of measures taken.<ref>{{cite journal|last=van Staaij|first=BK|coauthors=van den Akker, EH; van der Heijden, GJ; Schilder, AG; Hoes, AW|title=Adenotonsillectomy for upper respiratory infections: evidence based?|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|date=2005 Jan|volume=90|issue=1|pages=19–25|pmid=15613505|doi=10.1136/adc.2003.047530|pmc=1720065}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Burton|first=MJ|coauthors=Glasziou, PP|title=Tonsillectomy or adeno-tonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment for chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2009 Jan 21|issue=1|pages=CD001802|pmid=19160201|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001802.pub2}}</ref> Recurrent episodes of pharyngitis which test positive for GAS may also represent a person who is a chronic carrier of GAS who is getting recurrent viral infections.<ref name=IDSA2012/> Treating people who have been exposed but who are without symptoms is not recommended.<ref name=IDSA2012/> Treating people who are carriers of GAS is not recommended as the risk of spread and complications is low.<ref name=IDSA2012/>

==Treatment==
Untreated streptococcal pharyngitis usually resolves within a few days.<ref name=Review09/>  Treatment with antibiotics shortens the duration of the acute illness by about 16&nbsp;hours.<ref name=Review09/>  The primary reason for treatment with antibiotics is to reduce the risk of complications such as [[rheumatic fever]] and [[retropharyngeal abscess]]es<ref name=Review09/> and they are effective if given within 9 days of the onset of symptoms.<ref name=Review10/>

===Analgesics===
Analgesics such as [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) and [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) help significantly in the management of pain associated with strep throat.<ref name=Review00>{{cite journal | author = Thomas M, Del Mar C, Glasziou P | title = How effective are treatments other than antibiotics for acute sore throat? | journal = Br J Gen Pract | volume = 50 | issue = 459 | pages = 817–20 | year = 2000 | month = October | pmid = 11127175 | pmc = 1313826 | doi =  }}</ref> Viscous [[lidocaine]] may also be useful.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/lidocaine_viscous/article.htm |title=Generic Name: Lidocaine Viscous (Xylocaine Viscous) side effects, medical uses, and drug interactions |work=MedicineNet.com |accessdate=2010-05-07}}</ref> While [[steroids]] may help with the pain<ref name=Review10/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123372200/abstract |title=Effectiveness of Corticosteroid Treatment in Acute Pharyngitis: A Systematic Review of the Literature.|work=Andrew Wing. 2010; Academic Emergency Medicine  |accessdate=}}</ref> they are not routinely recommended.<ref name=IDSA2012/> Aspirin may be used in adults but is not recommended in children due to the risk of [[Reye's syndrome]].<ref name=Review10/>

===Antibiotics===
The antibiotic of choice in the United States for streptococcal pharyngitis is [[Phenoxymethylpenicillin|penicillin V]] due to safety, cost, and effectiveness.<ref name=Review09/>  [[Amoxicillin]] is preferred in Europe.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bonsignori F, Chiappini E, De Martino M | title = The infections of the upper respiratory tract in children | journal = Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol | volume = 23 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = 16–9 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20152073 | doi =  }}</ref>  In India, where the risk of rheumatic fever is higher, intramuscular [[benzathine penicillin]] G is the first choice for treatment.<ref name=Review10/> Appropriate antibiotics decrease the average 3–5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness.<ref name=IDSAGuideline2002/> They are primarily prescribed out of a motivation to reduce rare complications such as [[rheumatic fever]] and [[peritonsillar abscess]].<ref name=InternalMedPosition2001>{{cite journal | author = Snow V, Mottur-Pilson C, Cooper RJ, Hoffman JR | title = Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute pharyngitis in adults | journal = Ann Intern Med | volume = 134 | issue = 6 | pages = 506–8 | year = 2001 | month = March | pmid = 11255529 | doi =  | url = http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/134/6/506.pdf }}</ref> The arguments in favour of antibiotic treatment should be balanced by the consideration of possible side effects,<ref name=Review2001/> and it is reasonable to suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication.<ref name=InternalMedPosition2001/> Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a higher rate than would be expected from its prevalence.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Linder JA, Bates DW, Lee GM, Finkelstein JA | title = Antibiotic treatment of children with sore throat | journal = J Am Med Assoc | volume = 294 | issue = 18 | pages = 2315–22 | year = 2005 | month = November | pmid = 16278359 | doi = 10.1001/jama.294.18.2315 }}</ref> [[Erythromycin]] and other [[macrolides]] or [[clindamycin]] are recommended for people with severe [[penicillin allergy|penicillin allergies]].<ref name=IDSA2012/><ref name=Review09/> First generation [[cephalosporins]] may be used in those with less severe allergies<ref name=Review09/> and some evidence supports cephalosporins as superior to penicillin.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pichichero|first=M|coauthors=Casey, J|title=Comparison of European and U.S. results for cephalosporin versus penicillin treatment of group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis.|journal=European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology|date=2006 Jun|volume=25|issue=6|pages=354-64|pmid=16767482|doi=10.1007/s10096-006-0154-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Casey|first=JR|coauthors=Pichichero, ME|title=The evidence base for cephalosporin superiority over penicillin in streptococcal pharyngitis.|journal=Diagnostic microbiology and infectious disease|date=2007 Mar|volume=57|issue=3 Suppl|pages=39S-45S|pmid=17292576|doi=10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2006.12.020}}</ref> Streptococcal infections may also lead to [[acute glomerulonephritis]], however the incidence of this side effect is not reduced by the use of antibiotics.<ref name=Review10/>
