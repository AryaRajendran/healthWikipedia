'''Hatzolah'''/'''Hatzalah''' ("rescue" or "relief" in {{lang-he|'''הצלה'''}}) is a volunteer [[Emergency Medical Services|Emergency Medical Service]] (EMS) organization serving mostly [[Jew]]ish communities around the world. Most local branches operate independently of each other, but use the common name. The Hebrew spelling of the name is always the same, but there are many variations in transliteration, such as Hatzolah, Hatzoloh, Hatzalah, and Hatzola.<ref name="Affiliates">{{cite web |title=Affiliates|url=http://www.hatzalah.org/affiliates.php}}</ref> It is also often called Chevra Hatzolah, which loosely translates as "Company of Rescuers" or "Group of Rescuers."

==History==

The original Hatzolah EMS was founded in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], [[New York]], USA by Rabbi Hershel Weber in the late 1960s,<ref name="Willie">{{cite web |url=http://www.hatzolahw.org/ourmission.html |title=Williamsburg Services}}</ref> to improve rapid emergency medical response in the community, and to mitigate cultural concerns of a [[Yiddish]]-speaking, religious [[Hasidic]] community. The idea spread to other [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] neighborhoods in the [[New York metropolitan area|New York City area]], and eventually to other regions, countries, and continents. Hatzolah, as an organization, is the largest volunteer ambulance service in the world. Chevra Hatzalah in New York has more than a thousand volunteer EMTs and Paramedics who answer more than 250,000 calls each year with private vehicles and a fleet of more than 70 ambulances.

Hatzolah organizations now function in [[Israel]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], [[Mexico City]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], several provinces of [[Canada]], [[Russia]]<ref name=Russia>{{cite web| title = Emergency Response Service for Jews in Russia's Capital | url=http://www.fjc.ru/news/newsArticle.asp?AID=235422 | year=2004|accessdate = 2006-12-26}}</ref> the [[United Kingdom]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2666123.stm|title=Jewish health service offers local care| work=BBC News | date=2003-01-19 | accessdate=2010-01-05| first=Caroline| last=Ryan}}</ref> and at least five states in the [[United States|US]]. 

In Israel, the largest Hatzalah organization is called [[United Hatzalah|Ichud Hatzalah]] ({{lang-he|איחוד הצלה}}), Hebrew for, "[[United Hatzalah]]." Ichud was founded in the aftermath of Israel's [[Second Lebanon War]] in 2006 when its founders decided they would like to improve unified central rescue response.

==Operations==
Hatzolah uses a [[fly-car]] system, where members are assigned [[Ad hoc|ad-hoc]] to respond to the emergency. The dispatcher requests any units for a particular emergency location. Members who think they will have best response times respond via [[Walkie-talkie|handheld radios]], and the dispatcher confirms the appropriate members. Two members will typically respond directly to the call in their private vehicles. A third member retrieves an [[ambulance]] from a base location.<ref name="NYC Ops"/>

Each directly-dispatched Hatzolah volunteer has a full medical technician "jump kit," in their car, with oxygen, trauma, and appropriate pharmaceutical supplies. Paramedic (EMT-P) members carry more extensive equipment and supplies, including  [[EKG]], [[Intravenous therapy|IV]], injection, intubation, and more pharmaceuticals.  Each volunteer is called a Unit (as in, a crew of one), and is assigned a unit number that starts with a neighborhood code, followed by a [[serial number]] for that neighborhood (e.g., "F-100" means "Flatbush unit number 100"<ref name="Madrich">{{cite book |title=Madrich L'Chevra Hatzalah |last=Handler |first=Mechel |coauthors=Rabbi Dovid Weinberger |publisher=Feldheim}}</ref>). Ambulances also have unit numbers in the same format, with the first few numbers for each neighborhood reserved for the ambulance numbers.<ref name="NYC Ops"/> Some neighborhoods have begun to assign 3-digit unit numbers to their ambulances, using numbers out of the range assigned to human member units (e.g. 900-numbers).

In some areas there may be periods where coverage is not strong enough, for example on a summer weekend. When this happens, coordinators may assign an on-call rotation. The rotation may still respond from their houses, or they may stay at the garage through their shift. In such periods, Hatzoloh functions closer to a typical EMS crew setup, though the dispatchers may still seek non-on-call members to respond, and there will still often be a non-ambulance responder as first dispatched, even if that responder starts from the base.<ref name="Madrich"/>

===Response times===
Hatzolah's model provides for speedy [[Certified first responder|first responder]] response times. Each Hatzolah neighborhood's response time varies.  For example, in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn]] daytime response times are under 4 minutes and nighttime response times are 7–8 minutes.<ref name="Bloomberg"/>   In the Beverly-La Brea neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]] response times average at sixty to ninety seconds.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=7785 | title= Jewish Journal | year=2001}}</ref>

===Organization===
Hatzolah is not a single organization. Each chapter operates autonomously, or in some cases, with varying levels of affiliation with neighboring Hatzolah chapters.<ref name=Affiliates/><ref name="NYC Branches"/>

In New York City's Hatzolah, there is a very simple operational hierarchy. Usually, there are two or three members who are "coordinators,"<ref name="NYC Struct">{{cite web |url=http://www.hatzalah.org/central.php|title=Regional Locations - Central Coordination}}</ref> managing all operations aspects of the chapter.

As Orthodox Jews, many volunteers see each other daily during [[Jewish services|prayers]], and especially on [[Shabbat]]. This allows them to remain organized despite the lack of an extensive formal hierarchy.

The coordinators are responsible for recruitment, interaction with municipal agency operations (police, fire, and EMS), first-line discipline, and day to day operations. The coordinators often are responsible, directly or via delegation, for arranging maintenance crews, who are often called service members or service units, and for purchasing supplies, ambulances, and other equipment. There is also an administrative function, often separate from the coordinator function. The chief administrator is often called a director or [[executive director]], and this is sometimes a paid position. All other positions in Hatzoloh, including coordinators, are held by unpaid volunteers.

Most of the New York State branches have some centralized administration and dispatch functions, known as "Central Hatzalah," or simply, "Central." The neighborhood organizations under Central are nevertheless independent. Most Hatzolah organizations pattern themselves after the Williamsburg and Central models (see operational descriptions below).

Formally, the New York City-area "Central Hatzolah" is called Chevra Hatzalah of New York. It combines dispatch and some other functions for over a dozen neighborhood organizations, including<ref name="NYC Branches">{{cite web |title=Regional Branches|url=http://www.hatzalah.org/localBranches.php}}</ref> [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]],<ref name=Willie/> [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]], Boro Park, [[Canarsie]], [[Lower East Side]], [[Upper West Side]], [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]], [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], [[Queens]], Rockaway/Lawrence, [[Seagate, Brooklyn|Seagate]], [[Catskills]], [[Staten Island]], [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], and others. As each of these areas is otherwise independent, each has its own fundraising, management, garages, ambulances, and assigned members. [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County, NY]] branches have a centralized dispatch system as well, but their [[central organization]] is separate from the other New York State centralized functions, and they have a looser relationship with their New York State brethren, though there is a great deal of cooperation among them.  Together, the combined New York State branches have grown to become the largest all-volunteer ambulance system in the United States.<ref name="Bloomberg">{{cite web | url=http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&catID=1194&doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2005a%2Fpr138-05.html&cc=unused1978&rc=1194&ndi=1 | title=Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg Announces Two Initiatives To Redevelop Underutilized Land In The Culver El Section Of [[Borough Park, Brooklyn]] | first=M. | last=Bloomberg | year=2005}}</ref> The volunteers are trained [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]s or [[paramedic]]s. 

Israel's Ichud/[[United Hatzalah]]'s founder and president is [[Eli Beer]]. The organization adopted a broader profile and has volunteers from all sectors of Israeli society. The organization's chairman is Zeev Kashash, the CEO since November 2012 is Yoni Gedj.

Outside of New York and Israel, there are many smaller Hatzolah organizations. Each of these operates as a self-contained unit, with no centralized organization or coordination. However, where there are other Hatzolahs nearby, there is often a great deal of cooperation.

==Community involvement==
Hatzolah organizations are often involved in other community activities, on top of their primary mission of emergency medical work. Many neighborhood chapters sponsor and participate in community events, both within the local Jewish community, and in the broader community.

Flatbush Hatzalah frequently plays softball against teams from local police precincts, firehouses, and hospitals.<ref>{{cite web |title=Haztalah Softball |url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/article.php?p=21146}}</ref>

Hatzolah of Passaic/Clifton works with the local Bikur Cholim<ref>{{cite web |title=Passaic/Clifton Health and Safety Fair |url=http://passaichealthandsafetyfair.com}}</ref> to put on a yearly Health & Safety Fair at no charge to the community, with participation from both Jewish and non-Jewish presenters, said to get a turnout possibly exceeding 25% community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Health and Safety Fair Press Release |url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/General+News/35385/PHOTOS:+Passaic-Clifton+Health+and+Safety+Fair.html}}</ref>

Many Hatzolahs worldwide<ref>{{cite web |title=Hatzolah Australia Fire Saftey|url=http://www.hatzolah.org.au/include/chanukah.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Canadian Hatzoloh Chanukah Safety |url=http://www.hatzoloh.ca/Docs/Chanukah_Safety.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=NYC Haztalah Purim Drinking Campaign |url=http://www.hakhel.info/archivesPublicService/HatzalahPurimSafety.pdf}}</ref> run safety campaigns related to drinking on Purim and fires on Chanukah and during Passover preparations.

==Specialization of Hatzolah EMS==
A number of items that are either unique to Hatzolah, or that are relatively unusual for an EMS include:

===Direct response===
Most EMS rely on crews with scheduled shifts operating from a known location.  Due to its members and the communities they serve usually living in proximity, Hatzolah relies little on scheduled crews and stations and rather has all service members on call 24×7 and members responding from wherever they are.<ref>a brief description of their Two-Tier system can be found 
at https://www.hatzalah.org/twotiered.php</ref>

===Cultural sensitivities===
Language, religion, and culture barriers create challenges for an emergency medical service.  Hatzalah is built to consider these challenges, especially with regard to [[halacha]] (Jewish law) and communities that only speak [[Yiddish]] or [[Hebrew]].

A Jew reluctant to violate Sabbath rules when receiving medical attention may be more at ease and easily convinced of the medical urgency, when the EMT or paramedic is a fellow [[Orthodox Jew]].  A female worried about physical modesty and contact is helped by knowing that a Jewish provider is aware of the details of her concerns, and will act to reduce the problem as much as possible.

Hatzolah was the subject of controversy as articles in the New York Post<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/jewish_siren_ladies_Ax71jq2CgYYdWPcFmCzwWN |work=New York Post |first=Reuven |last=Fenton |title=Jewish ‘siren' ladies |date=2011-09-26 |accessdate=6 June 2012}}</ref> and JEMS Magazine<ref>http://www.jems.com/article/news/jewish-female-emts-plan-join-all-male-am</ref> criticize the organization for its discriminatory practice of not allowing women to join. The group of Orthodox Women cited the need for modesty and sensitivity to the needs of fellow Orthodox women. “This is a woman's job. Historically, women have always delivered babies. In our community, women also have a very strong motivation to seek female doctors," said their lawyer, Rachel Freier, a community resident and Orthodox Jewish mother of six.<ref>http://privateinvesigations.blogspot.com/2011/09/orthodox-women-demand-to-join-hatzalah.html</ref> Until now, Hatzolah has operated under this policy of discrimination, despite receiving public funding, such as the nearly half a million dollars in funding to overhaul the communication system at Hatzolah’s new command center in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn.<ref>http://www.vosizneias.com/59939/2010/07/12/brooklyn-ny-flatbush-hatzalah-receives-nearly-half-a-million-grant-from-assemblywoman/</ref>

===Cost===
In areas where the EMS charges a fee, lower income clientele lacking health insurance may have a reluctance to call for an ambulance unless the evidence of urgency is overwhelming.  A volunteer service, with less overhead costs, tends to reduce that reluctance.  Hatzolah will often handle "check-out" cases, without charge. In this way, the true emergencies among those check-outs may be recognized and treated quickly, where the caller might have otherwise not sought treatment.<ref name=WhenToCall>{{cite web |url=http://www.hatzolahofla.org/when-to-call |title=Hatzolah LA When To Call Us |publisher=Hatzolah of Los Angeles}}</ref>

===Patient Advocacy===
In contrast with most other EMS agencies, many Hatzolah volunteers will remain at the hospital with the patient long after bringing them to the emergency department. This is especially true during serious cases in order to help the patient and/or their families navigate the sometimes confusing series of events that occur during an emergency. Members will stay to explain, advocate and sometimes help make arrangements to bring in other specialists or arrange transfer to higher care facilities.

==Interaction with other agencies==
At times there have been difficulties in dealing with outside organizations, including other first-responders,<ref>www.crownheights.info/index.php?itemid=35532</ref>
.<ref>www.catskillscoop.com/2012/08/breaking-hatzolah-members-illegally-ticketed-while-responding-to-life-threatening-emergency.html</ref>

In general, branches have excellent relations with state and local police and EMS.<ref>collive.com/show_news.rtx?id=16819</ref> 

An example of those operating in uneven <ref>e.g. seasonal</ref> or otherwise especially challenging situations <ref>Israel, see below</ref> is '''Catskills Hatzolah''' : handling the swelling summer crowd.<ref>www.twitpic.com/photos/911BUFF?page=6</ref><ref>In the Catskills: A Century of the Jewish Experience, ISBN 0-231123-612, p. 339</ref>

Israel's '''[[United Hatzalah]]''' has shared its expertise with a group of [[Arab]] volunteers from [[East Jerusalem]] to form an emergency first response unit called Nuran. The group since has been dismantled and the volunteers were incorporated in United Hatzalah. 

[[United Hatzalah]]'s relationship with [[Magen David Adom]], however, is strained, and MDA has banned its members and volunteers from also volunteering in other rescue organizations, including Hatzalah.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3685792,00.html |title=Haredi Rescue Organizations Collapsing |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |author=Gilhar, Uri |date=March 13, 2009 |accessdate=6 June 2012}}</ref>

On February 20, 2013, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] granted Chevrah Hatzalah's request for a waiver to obtain calling party numbers (CPN) even when callers have [[Caller_ID_blocking#Blocking|caller ID blocking]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Petition of Chevrah Hatzalah Volunteer Ambulance Corps Inc. for Waiver of Section 1601(b) of the Commission’s Rules – Blocked Telephone Numbers|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2013/db0220/DA-13-227A1.pdf}}</ref> Calls to [[9-1-1|911]] are exempt from CPN blocking but calls to Chevrah Hatzalah do not go through 911.

==September 11, 2001==
Hatzalah members were among the first responders to the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.<ref name=102m>A number of Hatzoloh volunteers wearing "Flatbush Hatzoloh Paramedics" uniforms are featured in the documentary film ''[[102 Minutes That Changed America]]''.</ref> Alongside other rescue workers, Hatzalah volunteers rescued, treated, and transported countless victims of the terrorist attack.<ref name="102m"/> In the process they earned great respect from their peers in the emergency service community.<ref name="kelty">{{cite web |title=Jimmy Kelty |url=http://www.hatzalah.org/duringAttack.php |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68E8KP0Ss |archivedate=2012-06-06 |accessdate=6 June 2012}}</ref>
