===Circumcision===
In a 2012 position statement, the academy stated that a systematic evaluation of the medical literature shows that the "preventive health benefits of elective [[circumcision]] of male newborns outweigh the risks of the procedure" and that the health benefits "are sufficient to justify access to this procedure for families choosing it and to warrant third-party payment for circumcision of male newborns," but "are not great enough to recommend routine circumcision for all male newborns".  The academy takes the position that parents should make the final decision about circumcision, after appropriate information is gathered about the risks and benefits of the procedure.<ref name=AAP2012>{{cite journal

====Criticism====
Since the AAP revised its circumcision policy statement, it has received international criticism from human rights and medical organizations around the world.<ref>{{cite web

There is an ongoing debate in [[Pediatrics (journal)|''Pediatrics'']] and the [[Journal of Medical Ethics|''Journal of Medical Ethics'']] between the AAP and an ad-hoc group of Western doctors, ethicists and lawyers:<ref name="peds">{{cite web

<blockquote>[O]nly 1 of the arguments put forward by the American Academy of Pediatrics has some theoretical relevance in relation to infant male circumcision; namely, the possible protection against urinary tract infections in infant boys, which can easily be treated with antibiotics without tissue loss. The other claimed health benefits, including protection against HIV/AIDS, genital herpes, genital warts, and penile cancer, are questionable, weak, and likely to have little public health relevance in a Western context, and they do not represent compelling reasons for surgery before boys are old enough to decide for themselves. <ref name="peds"/><ref name="medethics"/></blockquote>

<blockquote>The AAP ignores so many important topics that it is hard to know where to begin. For example, the anatomy and function of the foreskin are not mentioned in their documents, even though they propose to cut it off without first considering the harm and pain that result from its removal. The AAP’s circumcision recommendations contradict its own bioethics policy statement, which requires pediatric care to be based only on the needs of the patient. Non-therapeutic circumcision is incompatible with widely accepted ground rules for surgical intervention in minors.<ref>{{cite web

====AAP Response to Criticism====
The AAP responded to criticism in the [[Journal of Medical Ethics|''Journal of Medical Ethics'']] by accusing European doctors of cultural bias against circumcision.<ref>{{cite journal

==Controversy==
In April 2010, the academy revised its policy statement on [[female circumcision]], with one part of the new policy proving controversial. Although condemning female circumcision overall, this statement suggested that current federal law banning female circumcision had the unintended consequence of driving families to perform the procedures in other countries, where these girls faced increased risk.  As a possible compromise, this policy statement suggested that physicians have the option to perform a ceremonial "nick" on girls as a last resort to prevent them from being sent overseas for full circumcision.  This particular position proved controversial to advocates for a full ban on female circumcision under any circumstances<ref>{{cite web
