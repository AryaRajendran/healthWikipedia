'''Blood plasma''' is the straw-colored/pale-yellow [[liquid]] component of [[blood]] that normally holds the [[blood cell]]s in [[whole blood]] in [[Suspension_(chemistry)|suspension]]. It makes up about 55% of total blood [[volume]]. It is the [[intravascular]] fluid part of [[extracellular fluid]] (all body fluid outside of cells). It is mostly water (92% by volume), and contains dissolved [[protein|proteins]] (i.e.—[[albumin]]s, [[globulin]]s, and [[fibrinogen]]), [[glucose]], [[clotting factors]], [[electrolyte]]s (Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> Cl<sup>-</sup> etc.), [[hormone]]s and [[carbon dioxide]] (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation). Plasma also serves as the protein reserve of the human body. It plays a vital role in intravascular [[osmotic]] effect that keeps [[electrolyte]] in balance form and protects the body from [[infection]] and other [[blood]] disorders.<ref name=Bloodplasma>{{cite web|url=http://bloodbanker.com/plasma/plasma-donation/ways-to-keep-your-blood-plasma-healthy/|title=Ways to Keep Your Blood Plasma Healthy|accessdate=November 10, 2011}}</ref> 

Blood plasma is prepared by [[Blood fractionation|spinning a tube of fresh blood]] containing an [[anticoagulant]] in a [[centrifuge]] until the blood cells fall to the bottom of the tube. The blood plasma is then poured or drawn off.<ref name="Maton">{{cite book

'''[[Plasmapheresis]]''' is a medical therapy that involves blood plasma extraction, treatment, and reintegration.

==Plasma Volume==
Blood plasma volume may be expanded by or drained to [[extravascular fluid]] when there are changes in [[Starling forces]] across capillary walls. For example, when [[blood pressure]] drops in [[Shock (circulatory)|circulatory shock]], Starling forces drive fluid into the interstitium, causing "third spacing."

If one stands still for a prolonged period, this causes an increase in [[transcapillary hydrostatic pressure]]. As a result, approximately 12% of blood plasma volume crosses into the [[extravascular compartment]]. This causes an increase in [[hematocrit]], [[serum total protein]], [[blood viscosity]] and, as a result of increased concentration of [[coagulation factors]], it causes [[orthostatic hypercoagulability]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Masoud M, Sarig G, Brenner B, Jacob G |title=Orthostatic hypercoagulability: a novel physiological mechanism to activate the coagulation system |journal=Hypertension |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=1545–51 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18413485 |doi=10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.108.112003 |url=}}</ref>

==Medical history==
[[File:Private Roy W. Humphrey of Toledo, Ohio is being given blood plasma after he was wounded by shrapnel in Sicily on 8-9-43 - NARA - 197268.jpg|thumb|American wounded soldier receiving blood plasma in August, 1943]]
The use of blood plasma as a substitute for whole blood and for transfusion purposes was proposed in March 1918, in the correspondence columns of the British Medical Journal, by Gordon R. Ward. "Dried plasmas" in powder or strips of material format were developed and first used in [[World War II]].  Prior to the [[United States]]' involvement in the war, liquid plasma and [[whole blood]] were used.  The "Blood for Britain" program during the early 1940s was quite successful (and popular in the United States) based on Dr. [[Charles Drew]]'s contribution.  A large project began in August 1940 to collect blood in [[New York City]] hospitals for the export of plasma to [[United Kingdom|Britain]].  Dr. Drew was appointed medical supervisor of the "Plasma for Britain" project.  His notable contribution at this time was to transform the [[test tube]] methods of many blood researchers into the first successful mass production techniques. 

Nonetheless, the decision was made to develop a dried plasma package for the armed forces as it would reduce breakage and make the transportation, packaging, and storage much simpler.<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter1.htm Transfusion before World War I]</ref>
The resulting dried plasma package came in two tin cans containing 400 cc bottles.  One bottle contained enough [[distilled water]] to reconstitute the dried plasma contained within the other bottle.  In about three minutes, the plasma would be ready to use and could stay fresh for around four hours.<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter7.htm Plasma Equipment and Packaging, and Transfusion Equipment]</ref>

Following the "Plasma for Britain" invention, Dr. Drew was named director of the [[Red Cross]] [[blood bank]] and assistant director of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]], in charge of blood collection for the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]].  Dr. Drew argued against the armed forces directive that blood/plasma was to be separated by the [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] of the [[blood donation|donor]].  Dr. Drew argued that there was no racial difference in human blood and that the policy would lead to needless deaths as soldiers and sailors were required to wait for "same race" blood.<ref>{{cite book

By the end of the war the [[American Red Cross]] had provided enough blood for over six million plasma packages.  Most of the surplus plasma was returned to the United States for civilian use. [[Serum albumin]] replaced dried plasma for combat use during the [[Korean War]].<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter11.htm The Plasma Program]</ref>

==Plasma donation==
Plasma is used in [[blood transfusion]]s, typically as [[fresh frozen plasma]] (FFP) or [[Plasma Frozen Within 24 Hours After Phlebotomy]] (PF24).  When donating whole blood or [[packed red blood cell]] (PRBC) transfusions, [[ABO blood type]] O- is the most desirable and is considered a "universal donor," since it has neither A nor B [[antigens]] and can be safely transfused to most recipients.  Type AB+ is the "universal recipient" type for whole blood or PRBC donations.  However, for plasma the situation is somewhat reversed. Blood donation centers will sometimes collect only plasma from AB donors through [[apheresis]], as their plasma does not contain the antibodies that may cross react with recipient antigens.  As such, AB is often considered the "universal donor" for plasma. Special programs exist just to cater to the male AB plasma donor, because of concerns about [[transfusion related acute lung injury]] (TRALI) and female donors who may have higher leukocyte antibodies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.nih.gov/blooddonor/donationtypes/ab_plasma.html |title=AB Plasma Donor Program |publisher=NIH Clinical Center |date=March 20, 2008 |accessdate=2011-03-18}}</ref> However, some studies show an increased risk of TRALI despite increased leukocyte antibodies in women who have been pregnant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/564739 |title=Female Plasma May Not Increase Risk for Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury |publisher=Medscape |date=October 23, 2007 |accessdate=2011-07-02}}</ref>

==Safety and compensation to donors==
In contrast to whole blood donation, plasma donation may be done much more often (3 times per week in some jurisdictions, compared to once per 8 weeks for whole blood donation), because the whole blood cells are returned to the body during the donation process, and most plasma is naturally replaced by the body within 48 hours. Also in contrast to whole blood donation, plasma donors are often compensated financially ($10–$100 per week for 5 +/- 2 hours of time, normally). It is usually a compensation for time and trouble, not a "purchase" or "sale" of a body part, for various legal, ethical, and cultural reasons. Professional donation centers use sterile and safe practices.

==Synthetic blood plasma==

[[Simulated Body Fluid (SBF)]] is a solution with similar ion concentration to those of human blood plasma. SBF is normally used for surface modification of metallic implants, and recently in [[gene delivery]] application.
