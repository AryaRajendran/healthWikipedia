'''Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis''' ('''PAM''', or '''PAME''') is a disease of the [[central nervous system]] caused by infection from ''[[Naegleria fowleri]]''.<ref name="pmid11425704">{{cite journal |author=Cabanes PA, Wallet F, Pringuez E, Pernin P |title=Assessing the risk of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis from swimming in the presence of environmental Naegleria fowleri |journal=Appl.

==Presentation==
''Naegleria fowleri'' propagates in warm, stagnant bodies of [[freshwater]] (typically during the summer months), and enters the central nervous system after [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] of infected water by attaching itself to the [[olfactory nerve]].<ref name="pmid18509301">{{cite journal |title=Primary amebic meningoencephalitis—Arizona, Florida, and Texas, 2007 |journal=MMWR Morb.

During this stage, occurring approximately 3–7 days post-infection, the typical symptoms are [[parosmia]], rapidly progressing to [[anosmia]] (with resultant [[ageusia]]) as the nerve cells of the olfactory bulbs are consumed and replaced with [[necrotic]] lesions.

After the organisms have multiplied and largely consumed the olfactory bulbs, the infection rapidly spreads through the [[mitral cell]] [[axons]] to the rest of the [[cerebrum]], resulting in onset of frank [[encephalitis|encephalitic]] symptoms, including [[cephalgia]] (headache), [[nausea]], and [[Rigidity (neurology)|rigidity]] of the neck muscles, progressing to vomiting, [[delirium]], [[seizures]], and eventually irreversible coma. Death usually occurs within 14 days of exposure as a result of [[respiratory failure]] when the infection spreads to the [[brain stem]], destroying the autonomic nerve cells of the [[medulla oblongata]].

The disease is both exceptionally rare and highly lethal: there had been fewer than 200 confirmed cases in recorded medical history as of 2004,<ref name="pmid15208515">{{cite journal |author=Wiwanitkit V |title=Review of clinical presentations in Thai patients with primary amoebic meningoencephalitis |journal=MedGenMed |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=2 |year=2004 |pmid=15208515 |pmc=1140726 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/468088}}</ref> 300 cases as of 2008,<ref name="pmid18820207">{{cite journal |author=Caruzo G, Cardozo J |title=Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis: a new case from Venezuela |journal=Trop Doct |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=256–7 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18820207 |doi=10.1258/td.2008.070426 |url=http://td.rsmjournals.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18820207}}</ref> with an in-hospital [[case fatality rate]] of ~97% (3% patient [[survival rate]]).

The high [[mortality rate]] of this disease is largely blamed on the unusually non-suggestive [[symptom]]ology of the early-stage disease compounded by the necessity of [[microbial culture]] of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] to effect a positive [[diagnosis]]. The parasite also demonstrates a particularly rapid late-stage propagation through the nerves of the [[olfactory system]] to many parts of the brain simultaneously (including the vulnerable [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]]).

For those reasons, it has been suggested that physicians should give an array of antimicrobial drugs, including the drugs used to treat amoebic encephalitis, before the disease is actually confirmed in order to increase the number of survivors. However, administering several of those drugs at once (or even some of them known to treat the condition) is often very dangerous and unpleasant for the patient.

==Cause==
''Naegleria fowleri'' is commonly referred to as an amoeba but is actually a unicellular parasite that is ubiquitous in soils and warm waters. Infection typically occurs during the summer months and patients typically have a history of exposure to a natural body of water. The organism specifically prefers temperatures above 32&nbsp;°C, as might be found in a tropical climate{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} or in water heated by geothermal activity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.govt.nz/Environmental-information/Natural-hazards/Geothermal-activity/|title=Geothermal activity|accessdate=9 January 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The organism is extremely sensitive to chlorine (<0.5&nbsp;ppm). Exposure to the organism is extremely common due to its wide distribution in nature, but thus far lacks the ability to infect the body through any method other than direct contact with the olfactory nerve, which is exposed only at the extreme vertical terminus of the [[paranasal sinuses]]; the contaminated water must be deeply insufflated into the [[paranasal sinuses|sinus cavities]] for transmission to occur.

Michael Beach, a recreational waterborne illness specialist for the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], stated in remarks to the Associated Press that the wearing of nose-clips to prevent insufflation of contaminated water would be an effective protection against contracting PAM, noting that "You'd have to have water going way up in your nose to begin with".<ref>''"6 die from brain-eating amoeba in lakes"'', Chris Kahn/Associated Press, 9/28/07</ref>

==Treatment==

The current standard treatment is prompt [[intravenous]] administration of [[heroic measure|heroic]] doses of [[Amphotericin B]], a systemic [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] that is one of the few effective treatments for systemic infections of [[protozoan]] [[parasitic diseases]] (such as [[leishmaniasis]] and [[toxoplasmosis]]).

The success rate in treating PAM is usually quite poor, since by the time of definitive diagnosis most patients have already manifested signs of terminal cerebral [[necrosis]]. Even if definitive diagnosis is effected early enough to allow for a course of medication, Amphotericin B also causes significant and permanent [[nephrotoxicity]] in the doses necessary to quickly halt the progress of the amoebae through the brain.

[[Rifampicin]] has also been used with amphotericin B in successful treatment.<ref name="pmid2056258">{{cite journal |author=Poungvarin N, Jariya P |title=The fifth nonlethal case of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis |journal=J Med Assoc Thai |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=112–5 |year=1991 |month=February |pmid=2056258 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid12577098">{{cite journal |author=Jain R, Prabhakar S, Modi M, Bhatia R, Sehgal R |title=Naegleria meningitis: a rare survival |journal=Neurol India |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=470–2 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12577098 |url=http://www.neurologyindia.com/article.asp?issn=0028-3886;year=2002;volume=50;issue=4;spage=470;epage=2;aulast=Jain}}</ref><ref name="pmid15900627">{{cite journal |author=Vargas-Zepeda J, Gómez-Alcalá AV, Vásquez-Morales JA, Licea-Amaya L, De Jonckheere JF, Lares-Villa F |title=Successful treatment of Naegleria fowleri meningoencephalitis by using intravenous amphotericin B, fluconazole and rifampicin |journal=Arch.
