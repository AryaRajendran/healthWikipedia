''' Short-term effects of alcohol''' can take on many forms. The [[drug]] [[alcohol]], to be specific [[ethanol]], is a [[central nervous system depressant]] with a range of [[adverse effect|side-effects]]. [[Cell membrane]]s are highly permeable to alcohol, so once alcohol is in the bloodstream it can diffuse into nearly every biological tissue of the body.

The [[concentration]] of alcohol in [[blood]] is usually measured in terms of the [[blood alcohol content]]. The amount and circumstances of consumption play a large part in determining the extent of [[alcohol intoxication|intoxication]]; for example, eating a heavy meal before alcohol consumption causes alcohol to absorb more slowly.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Horowitz M, Maddox A, Bochner M, ''et al.'' |title=Relationships between gastric emptying of solid and caloric liquid meals and alcohol absorption |journal=Am. J. Physiol. |volume=257 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=G291–8 |year=1989 |month=August |pmid=2764113 |url=http://ajpgi.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=reprint&pmid=2764113}}</ref> [[Dehydration|Hydration]] also plays a role, especially in determining the extent of [[hangover]]s.<ref>http://ask.yahoo.com/20020805.html</ref> After [[binge drinking|excessive drinking]], [[unconsciousness]] can occur and extreme levels of consumption can lead to [[alcohol poisoning]] and death (a concentration in the blood stream of 0.40% will [[median lethal dose|kill half of those affected]]<ref name="Awareness">[http://www.radford.edu/~kcastleb/bac.html Alcohol Awareness Page]</ref><ref name="BAC">[http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/wellness/info/alcohol/bac/ Carleton College: Wellness Center: Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)]</ref>). Alcohol may also cause death by [[asphyxiation]] from [[vomiting|vomit]].

[[Alcohol]] is an addictive drug that can greatly exacerbate sleep problems. During [[abstinence]], residual disruptions in sleep regularity and sleep patterns{{Clarify|date=March 2010|reason=Sleep maintenance and architecture are meaningless phrases to 99.9% of our readers, who are not doctors.}} are the greatest predictors of [[relapse]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |author=Feige B, Scaal S, Hornyak M, Gann H, Riemann D |title=Sleep electroencephalographic spectral power after withdrawal from alcohol in alcohol-dependent patients |journal=Alcohol.

==Sleep==
{{main|Alcohol use and sleep}}

===Moderate alcohol consumption and sleep disruptions===
Moderate alcohol consumption 30–60 minutes before sleep, although decreasing [[sleep onset latency]], disrupts sleep architecture.<ref name="Roehrs & Roth">{{cite journal |author=Roehrs T, Roth T |title=Sleep, sleepiness, and alcohol use |journal=Alcohol Res Health |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=101–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11584549 }}</ref> Rebound effects occur once the alcohol has been largely metabolized, causing late night disruptions in sleep maintenance.  Under conditions of moderate alcohol consumption where blood alcohol levels average 0.06–0.08 percent and decrease 0.01–0.02 percent per hour, an alcohol clearance rate of 4–5 hours would coincide with disruptions in sleep maintenance in the second half of an 8 hour sleep episode.<ref name="Roehrs & Roth" /> In terms of sleep architecture, moderate doses of alcohol facilitate "rebounds" in [[rapid eye movement (sleep)|rapid eye movement]] (REM) and [[Sleep#Stages of sleep|stage 1 sleep]]; following suppression in REM and stage 1 sleep in the first half of an 8 hour sleep episode, REM and stage 1 sleep increase well beyond baseline in the second half. Moderate doses of alcohol also very quickly increase [[slow wave sleep]] (SWS) in the first half of an 8 hour sleep episode.<ref name="Roehrs & Roth" /> Enhancements in REM sleep and SWS following moderate alcohol consumption are mediated by reductions in [[glutamatergic]] activity by [[adenosine]] in the [[central nervous system]].<ref name="Roehrs & Roth" /> In addition, tolerance to changes in sleep maintenance and sleep architecture develops within 3 days of alcohol consumption before bedtime.<ref name="Roehrs & Roth" />

===Alcohol consumption and sleep improvements===
Low doses of alcohol (one {{convert|360|ml|0|abbr=on}} [[beer]]) appear to increase total sleep time and reduce awakening during the night. The sleep-promoting benefits of alcohol [[dissipate]] at moderate and higher doses of alcohol.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(80)90427-7 |author=Stone BM |title=Sleep and low doses of alcohol |journal=Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=706–9 |year=1980 |month=June |pmid=6155259 }}</ref> Previous experience with alcohol also influences the extent to which alcohol positively or negatively affects sleep.

===Alcohol consumption and fatigue===
Conditions of [[sleep deprivation]] correlate positively with increased alcohol consumption.<ref name="Roehrs & Roth" /> In Northern climates, increased alcohol consumption during the winter is attributed to escalations in fatigue.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=M.

===Alcohol abstinence and sleep disruptions===
[[Hormonal imbalance]] and sleep disruption following withdrawal from chronic alcohol consumption are strong predictors of relapse.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> During abstinence, recovering alcoholics have attenuated [[melatonin]] secretion at onset of a sleep episode, resulting in prolonged sleep onset latencies.<ref name="Kühlwein, E. 1443">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0006-3223(03)00005-2 |author=Kühlwein E, Hauger RL, Irwin MR |title=Abnormal nocturnal melatonin secretion and disordered sleep in abstinent alcoholics |journal=Biol.

==Alcohol consumption and balance==
Alcohol affects balance, by changing the viscosity of the endolymph within the otolithic membrane, the fluid inside the semicircular canals inside the ear.  The endolymph surrounds the cupula which contains hair cells within the semicircular canals.  When the head is tilted, the endolymph flows and moves the cupula.  The hair cells then bend and send signals to the brain indicating the direction in which the head is tilted.  By changing the viscosity of the endolymph to become less dense when alcohol enters the system, the hair cells can move more easily within the ear, which sends the signal to the brain and results in exaggerated and overcompensated movements of body.  This can also result in vertigo, or "the spins."<ref name="Why does my head spin when I'm drunk?">[http://scienceline.org/2011/02/why-does-my-head-spin-when-i%E2%80%99m-drunk/], Why does my head spin when I'm drunk?

==Effects by dosage==
Different concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different effects on the subject.

The following lists the common effects of alcohol on the body, depending on the blood alcohol concentration (BAC). However, tolerance varies considerably between individuals, as does individual response to a given dosage; the effects of alcohol differ widely between people.  Hence, [[Blood alcohol concentration|BAC]] percentages are just estimates used for illustrative purposes.

<!--spacing-->

{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}
;<u>Euphoria</u> (BAC = 0.03% to 0.12%):
* Overall improvement in mood and possible [[euphoria]] {{spaces|15}}
* Increased self-confidence

* Shortened attention span
* [[Alcohol flush reaction|Flushed appearance]]
* Impaired judgment
* Impaired fine muscle coordination

===Moderate doses===
Ethanol inhibits the ability of glutamate to open the cation channel associated with the [[N-methyl-D-aspartate]] ([[NMDA]]) subtype of glutamate receptors.  Stimulated areas include the [[cortex (neuroanatomy)|cortex]], [[hippocampus]] and [[nucleus accumbens]], which are responsible for [[thinking]] and pleasure seeking. Another one of alcohol's agreeable effects is body relaxation, possibly caused by [[neurons]] transmitting electrical signals in an [[alpha waves]]-pattern; such waves are observed (with the aid of [[EEG]]s) when the body is relaxed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Short-term effects of alcohol include the risk of injuries, violence and fetal damage.<ref name="Andréasson-">{{Cite journal | last1 = Andréasson | first1 = S. | last2 = Allebeck | first2 = P. | title = [Alcohol as medication is no good.

Areas of the brain responsible for planning and motor learning are sharpened. A related effect, caused by even low levels of alcohol, is the tendency for people to become more animated in speech and movement. This is due to increased [[metabolism]] in areas of the brain associated with movement, such as the [[dopaminergic pathways|nigrostriatal pathway]]. This causes reward systems in the brain to become more active, which may induce certain individuals to behave in an uncharacteristically loud and cheerful manner.

Alcohol has been known to mitigate the production of [[antidiuretic hormone]], which is a hormone that acts on the kidney to favour water reabsorption in the kidneys during filtration. This occurs because alcohol confuses [[osmoreceptor]]s in the [[hypothalamus]], which relay [[osmotic pressure]] information to the [[posterior pituitary]], the site of [[antidiuretic hormone]] release. Alcohol causes the osmoreceptors to signal that there is low osmotic pressure in the blood, which triggers an inhibition of the [[antidiuretic hormone]]. As a consequence, one's kidneys are no longer able to reabsorb as much water as they should be absorbing, leading to creation of excessive volumes of urine and the subsequent overall dehydration.

===Excessive doses===
[[Acute alcohol intoxication]] through excessive doses in general causes short- or long-term health effects. [[NMDA]] receptors start to become unresponsive, slowing areas of the brain for which they are responsible. Contributing to this effect is the activity that alcohol induces in the [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA) system. The GABA system is known to inhibit activity in the brain.  GABA could also be responsible for the [[Anterograde amnesias|memory impairment]] that many people experience. It has been asserted that GABA signals interfere with the ''registration'' and ''consolidation'' stages of memory formation. As the GABA system is found in the hippocampus (among other areas in the CNS), which is thought to play a large role in memory formation, this is thought to be possible.

[[Anterograde amnesia]], colloquially referred to as "[[Blackout (alcohol-related amnesia)|blacking out]]", is another symptom of heavy drinking. This is the loss of memory during and after an episode of drinking. When alcohol is consumed at a rapid rate, the point at which most healthy people's long-term memory creation starts to fail usually occurs at approximately 0.20% BAC, but can be reached as low as 0.14% BAC for inexperienced drinkers.

Another classic finding of alcohol intoxication is [[ataxia]], in its appendicular, gait, and truncal forms. Appendicular ataxia results in jerky, uncoordinated movements of the limbs, as though each muscle were working independently from the others.  Truncal ataxia results in postural instability; gait instability is manifested as a disorderly, wide-based gait with inconsistent foot positioning.  Ataxia is responsible for the observation that drunk people are clumsy, sway back and forth, and often fall down.  It is presumed to be due to alcohol's effect on the [[cerebellum]].

At low or moderate doses, alcohol acts primarily as a positive [[allosteric]] modulator of [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]]. Alcohol binds to several different subtypes of GABA<sub>A</sub>, but not to others. The main subtypes responsible for the subjective effects of alcohol are the α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub>γ<sub>2</sub>, α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>3</sub>γ<sub>2</sub>, α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>3</sub>δ and α<sub>6</sub>β<sub>3</sub>δ subtypes, although other subtypes such as α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>3</sub>γ<sub>2</sub> and α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>3</sub>γ<sub>2</sub> are also affected. Activation of these receptors causes most of the effects of alcohol such as relaxation and relief from anxiety, sedation, ataxia and increase in appetite and lowering of inhibitions that can cause a tendency toward violence in some people.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Huang Q, He X, Ma C, ''et al.'' |title=Pharmacophore/receptor models for GABA<sub>A</sub>/BzR subtypes (α1β3γ2, α5β3γ2, and α6β3γ2) via a comprehensive ligand-mapping approach |journal=J.

Alcohol has a powerful effect on glutamate as well.  Alcohol decreases glutamate's ability to bind with NMDA and acts as an antagonist of the [[NMDA receptor]], which plays a critical role in [[Long-term potentiation|LTP]] by allowing [[Ca2+]] to enter the cell. These inhibitory effects are thought to be responsible for the "memory blanks" that can occur at levels as low as 0.03% blood level. In addition, reduced glutamate release in the dorsal hippocampus has been linked to spatial memory loss. Chronic alcohol users experience an upregulation of NMDA receptors because the brain is attempting to reestablish [[homeostasis]].  When a chronic alcohol user stops drinking for more than 10 hours, apoptosis can occur due to [[excitotoxicity]].  The seizures experienced during alcohol abstinence are thought to be a result of this NMDA upregulation. Alteration of NMDA receptor numbers in chronic alcoholics is likely to be responsible for some of the symptoms seen in [[delirium tremens]] during severe alcohol withdrawal, such as delirium and hallucinations. Other targets such as [[sodium channels]] can also be affected by high doses of alcohol, and alteration in the numbers of these channels in chronic alcoholics is likely to be responsible for as well as other effects such as [[cardiac]] [[arrhythmia]]. Other targets that are affected by alcohol include cannabinoid, opioid and dopamine receptors, although it is unclear whether alcohol affects these directly or if they are affected by downstream consequences of the GABA/NMDA effects. People with a family history of alcoholism may exhibit genetic differences in the response of their NMDA glutamate receptors as well as the ratios of GABA<sub>A</sub> subtypes in their brain.<ref>Shimizu, A.

Animal models using mammals and invertebrates have been informative in studying the effects of ethanol on not only pharmacokinetics of alcohol but also pharmacodynamics, in particular in the nervous system. Ethanol-induced intoxication is not uncommon in the animal kingdom, as noted here:

{{quote|"Many of us have noticed that bees or yellow jackets cannot fly well after having drunk the juice of overripe fruits or berries; bears have been seen to stagger and fall down after eating fermented honey; and birds often crash or fly haphazardly while intoxicated on ethanol that occurs naturally as free-floating microorganisms convert vegetable carbohydrates to alcohol."<ref>{{cite book |author=DeGrandpre, Richard J.; Bickel, Warren K. |title=Drug Policy and Human Nature: Psychological Perspectives on the Prevention, Management, and Treatment of Illicit Drug Abuse |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |year=1996 |pages= |isbn=0-306-45241-3 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=et0TcXEENUgC&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&dq=Drug+Policy+and+Human+Nature:+Psychological+Perspectives+On+The+Prevention,+Management,+and+Treatment+of+Illicit+Drug+Abuse}}</ref>}}

More recently, studies using animal models have begun to elucidate the effects of ethanol on the nervous system. Traditionally, many studies have been performed in mammals, such as mice, rats, and non-human primates. However, non-mammalian animal models have also been employed; in particular, Ulrike Heberlein group at UC San Francisco has used ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', the fruit fly, taking advantage of its facile genetics to dissect the neural circuits and molecular pathways, upon which ethanol acts. The series of studies carried in the Heberlein lab has identified insulin and its related signaling pathways as well as biogenic amines in the invertebrate nervous system as being important in alcohol tolerance.<ref>[http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/drunkbee.htm ''Latest Buzz in Research: Intoxicated Honey bees may clue Scientists into Drunken Human Behavior'', The Ohio State Research News, Research Communications, Columbus OH, 23 October 2004.]</ref><ref name=Abramson>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2000.tb02078.x |author=Abramson CI, Stone SM, Ortez RA, ''et al.'' |title=The development of an ethanol model using social insects I: behavior studies of the honey bee (''Apis mellifera L.'') |journal=Alcohol.

It is important to note that some of the analogous biochemical pathways and neural systems have been known to be important in alcohol's effects on humans, while the possibility that others may also be important remains unknown. Research of alcohol's effects on the nervous system remains a hot topic of research, as scientists inch toward understanding the problem of [[alcohol addiction]].

In addition to the studies carried out in invertebrates, researchers have also used vertebrate animal models to study various effects of ethanol on behaviors.
