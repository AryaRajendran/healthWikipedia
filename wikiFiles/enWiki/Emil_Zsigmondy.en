== Life ==
Zsigmondy was an excellent [[alpinist]], known for the risky nature of many of his climbs.<ref name="Smithsonian"/><ref name="Braham">{{cite book|last=Braham|first=Trevor|title=When the Alps Cast Their Spell: Mountaineers of the Alpine Golden Age|year=2011|publisher=The In Pinn|isbn=978-1-906476-34-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xcc8XBqOmywC&pg=PT254|pages=}}</ref> He began mountaineering as a teenager, climbing the [[Reisseck]] in [[Austria]] in a round trip of 26 hours with his brother, [[Otto Zsigmondy]]. By the late 1870s the two brothers were climbing [[Alpinism sans guide|without guides]] in the [[Zillertal Alps]]. In 1881, they climbed the [[Ortler]] from the [[Hochjoch]].<ref name="Smithsonian"/>

Emil Zsigmondy was the friend and companion of [[Ludwig Purtscheller]], the great pioneer of guideless Alpine climbing.<ref name="Braham"/> Emil and Otto climbed with Purtscheller in 1882 and 1884, including an ascent without guides of the Marinelli Couloir on [[Monte Rosa]]<ref name="Smithsonian"/> and the first guideless traverse of the [[Matterhorn]].<ref name="Smithsonian 2">''Mountaineers'' (Douglas/Smithsonian), p. 115.</ref> Zsigmondy's outstanding achievements include the [[first ascent]] by the east [[arête]] of the {{convert|3983|m}} high [[Meije]] in the [[Massif des Écrins]] range, made by Zsigmondy, his brother Otto, and Purtscheller on 26 July 1885. A few days later he died on the same mountain. He was killed in an attempt to climb the south face of the Meije on 6 August 1885, probably as a result of his rope slipping off a rock.<ref name="Gos"/><ref name="Frison-Roche">{{cite book|last1=Frison-Roche|first1=Roger|last2=Jouty|first2=Sylvain|others=Trans.

American historian and mountaineer [[W. A. B. Coolidge]] would later write: {{quote|It is impossible, of course, to fix the precise date at which guideless climbing began to be ''abused''. But no one can doubt that one of the first signs of the change in men's views was the tragic death of Emil Zsigmondy on the Meije in 1885 . . . there are limits even to human skill and human daring, and, in the opinion of the present writer, these were overstepped on that occasion.<ref name="Coolidge">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=df4OAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA249|first=W.

Zsigmondy is commemorated by the [[Zsigmondyspitze]] in the [[Zillertal Alps]], the Brèche Zsigmondy on the Meije (part of the route followed on the successful July 1885 climb), and the [[Zsigmondyhütte]] (''Rifugio Zsigmondy [[Emilio Comici|Comici]]'') in the [[Sexten Dolomites]].

== Family ==
Emil Zsigmondy was the second of the four sons of Dr. [[Adolf Zsigmondy]] of [[Pressburg]] (Bratislava), a [[dentist]] of [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] origin, and [[Irma von Szakmáry]], a poet from [[Martonvásár]]. His older brother, Otto, a dentist by profession, was also known as a mountaineer. His younger brother, [[Richard Adolf Zsigmondy]], was a chemist and in 1925 received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]. The youngest of the four brothers, [[Karl Zsigmondy]], was a mathematician; in number theory, [[Zsigmondy's theorem]] is named after him.<ref name="Smithsonian"/><ref name="Gos 3">Gos, p. 162.</ref> He was a cousin of the architect [[Frigyes Schulek]], whose mother was Auguszta Zsigmondy.
