== Characteristics ==
EEM syndrome exhibits a combination of prominent [[symptom]]s and features.

== Pathophysiology ==

[[Image:Autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|EEM syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of [[inheritance]].]]

EEM syndrome is caused by [[mutation]]s in the ''P-cadherin'' [[gene]] (''[[CDH3 (gene)|CDH3]]'').<ref name=cdh3>{{cite journal |author=Kjaer KW, Hansen L, Schwabe GC, Marques-de-Faria AP, Eiberg H, Mundlos S, Tommerup N, Rosenberg T |title=Distinct CDH3 mutations cause ectodermal dysplasia, ectrodactyly, macular dystrophy (EEM syndrome) |journal=J Med Genet. |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=292–298 |year=2005 |pmid=15805154 |doi=10.1136/jmg.2004.027821 |pmc=1736041 }}</ref> Distinct mutations in ''CDH3'' (located on human [[chromosome]] [[chromosome 16|16]]) are responsible for the macular dystrophy and spectrum of malformations found in EEM syndrome,<ref name=cdh3/> due in part to developmental errors caused by the resulting inability of ''CDH3'' to respond correctly to the ''P-cadherin'' [[transcription factor]] [[TP73L|p63]].<ref name=pcp63>{{cite journal |author=Shimomura Y, Wajid M, Shapiro L, Christiano AM |title=P-cadherin is a p63 target gene with a crucial role in the developing human limb bud and hair follicle  |journal=Development |volume=135 |issue=4 |pages=743–753 |year=2008 |pmid=18199584 |doi=10.1242/dev.006718 }}</ref> 

The gene for p63 (''[[TP73L]]'', found on human [[chromosome 3]]) may also play a role in EEM syndrome.<ref name=pcp63/> Mutations in this gene are associated with the symptoms of EEM and similar disorders, particularly ectrodactyly.<ref name=tp7>{{cite journal  |author=Zenteno JC, Berdon-Zapata V, Kofman-Alfaro S, Mutchinick O |title=Isolated ectrodactyly caused by a heterozygous missense mutation in the transactivation domain of Tp63 |journal=Am J Med Genet A. |volume=134 |issue=1 |pages=74–76 |year=2005  |pmid=15736220  |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.30277 }}</ref>

EEM syndrome is an [[autosomal recessive]] disorder,<ref name=e06/> which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene - one from each parent - are required to inherit the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one  copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.
