'''Ichthyosis''' (plural Ichthyoses) is a heterogeneous family of at least 28,<ref name=firstfaq>[http://www.scalyskin.org/column.cfm?ColumnID=13 ''FAQ''], Foundation for Ichthyosis & Related Skin Types (F.I.R.S.T)</ref> generalized, mostly [[genetic disorder|genetic]] [[skin]] [[dermatology|disorders]]. All types of ichthyosis have dry, thickened, scaly or flaky skin.<ref name="firstfaq" /> In many types there is [[cracked skin]],<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/ichthyosis thefreedictionary.com/ichthyosis] citing: Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine.

The most common type of ichthyosis is ichthyosis vulgaris, accounting for more than 95% of cases.<ref name=Okulicz2003>{{cite journal | author = Okulicz JF, Schwartz RA | year = 2003 | title = Hereditary and acquired ichthyosis vulgaris | journal = International Journal of Dermatology | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 95–8 | pmid = 12708996 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-4362.2003.01308.x }}</ref>

==Types==

There are many types of Ichthyosis and an exact diagnosis may be difficult. Types of Ichthyosis are classified by their appearance and their genetic cause. Ichthyosis caused by the same gene can vary considerably in severity and symptoms. Some Ichthyoses don't appear to fit exactly into any one type. Also different genes can produce Ichthyoses with similar symptoms. Of note, X-linked Ichthyosis is associated with [[Kallmann syndrome]] (close to ''KAL1'' gene). The most common or well-known types are as follows:<ref>[http://www.scalyskin.org/column.cfm?ColumnID=14 Types of Ichthyosis], Foundation for Ichthyosis & Related Skin Types (F.I.R.S.T)</ref>

=== Non-genetic ichthyosis ===
*[[Ichthyosis acquisita]]

==Diagnosis==
A physician often can diagnose ichthyosis by looking at the skin. A family history is very useful. In some cases, a skin biopsy is done to help to confirm the diagnosis. In a biopsy, a small piece of skin is removed and examined under a microscope. In some instances, genetic testing may be helpful in making a diagnosis. Diabetes has not been definitively linked to acquired ichthyosis or ichthyosis vulgaris; however, there are case reports associating new onset ichthyosis with diabetes.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Scheinfeld | first1 = N | last2 = Libkind | first2 = M | last3 = Freilich | first3 = S | title = New-onset ichthyosis and diabetes in a 14-year-old. | journal = Pediatric dermatology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 501–3 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11841637 | doi = 10.1046/j.1525-1470.2001.1862004.x }}</ref>

Ichthyosis is not more or less common in any ethnic group. As of now, there is no way to prevent ichthyosis.

==Treatments==
Treatments for ichthyosis often take the form of topical application of creams and [[emollient]] oils, in an attempt to hydrate the skin. Creams containing lactic acid have been shown to work exceptionally well in some cases. Applicaton of Propylene Glycol has been used as another treatment method.
[[Retinoid]]s are also used for some conditions. 

Exposure to sunlight may improve or worsen the condition. In some cases, excess dead skin sloughs off much better from wet tanned skin after bathing or a swim. Although the dry skin might be preferable to the damaging effects of sun exposure.


There can be ocular manifestations of ichthyosis, such as corneal and ocular surface diseases.  Vascularizing keratitis, which is more commonly found in congenital keratitis-ichythosis-deafness (KID), may worsen with isotretinoin therapy.

==Ichthyosis in animals==
Ichthyosis or ichthyosis-like diseases exist for several types of animals, including cattle, chickens, llamas, mice, and dogs.<ref>Sundberg, John P., [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5XW0CvVHwSUC ''Handbook of Mouse Mutations with Skin and Hair Abnormalities''], Page 333, Published by CRC Press, 1994, ISBN 0-8493-8372-2</ref> Ichthyosis of varying severity is well documented in some popular [[dog breed|breeds]] of domestic [[dog]]s. The most common breeds to have ichthyosis are [[Golden retriever]]s, [[American bulldog]]s, [[Jack Russell terrier]]s, and [[Cairn terrier]]s.<ref>Gross, Thelma Lee, [http://books.google.com/books?id=VKa2Wo3Wc-kC ''Veterinary Dermatopathology''], Page 174-179, Published by Blackwell Publishing, 2004, ISBN 0-632-06452-8</ref>
