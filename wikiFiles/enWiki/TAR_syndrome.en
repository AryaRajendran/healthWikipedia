'''TAR Syndrome''' ([[thrombocytopenia]] with [[absent radius]]) is a rare [[genetic disorder]] that is characterized by the absence of the [[Radius (bone)|radius bone]] in the forearm, and a dramatically reduced [[platelet]] count. This syndrome may occur as a part of the [[1q21.1 deletion syndrome]]

==Presentation==
Symptoms of [[thrombocytopenia]], or a lowered platelet count, leads to [[bruising]] and potentially life-threatening [[hemorrhage]].

Other common links between people with TAR seem to include [[heart]] problems, [[kidney]] problems, knee joint problems, frequently [[lactose intolerance]] and often [[thumb hypoplasia]]

==Treatment==
Treatments range from platelet transfusions to surgery aimed at either centralizing the hand over the ulna to improve functionality of the hand or aimed at 'normalizing' the appearance of the arm, which is much shorter and 'clubbed.'  There is some controversy surrounding the role of surgery.  The infant mortality rate has been curbed by new technology, including platelet transfusions, which can even be performed [[in utero]]. The critical period is the first and sometimes second year of life.  For most people with TAR, platelet counts improve as they grow out of childhood.

**(from a young woman born with TAR Syndrome)It is highly recommended that parents and significant adults involved with children with TAR become involved with one of many available information/ support groups or online forums as not all information can be published here as quickly as it is discovered. Shriners' Hospitals can be a great starting place. Support groups and informative personal websites can be found by simply searching online.

**Children can be fully involved with peers in everyday activities and can adapt quickly by trying new things to discover their abilities and limits at each age of life. People with TAR grow up to be independent, fully functioning, "car-driving", "gift-wrapping", "married-with-kids-of-their-own" kind of adults, happiest when supported and allowed to adapt while being encouraged and challenged, praised most for being persistent and patient, hard-working or clear thinking/communicating problem-solvers rather than simply "smart". Adaptive devices that prove helpful include dressing sticks, bigger buttons or easy closures on clothing, shoe-horns, curved eating utensils, bidets, water pistols (seriously, as an inconspicuous bidet substitute), elastic exercise bands and "pigtail" elastic shoelaces or slip-on shoes whenever possible, levers instead of knobs on doors, remotes instead of keys for door locks when possible, deep-pocket bed sheets, slide-out cupboard shelves or drawers, kitchen aprons with hot-pads sewn into the chest, and rubber protectors over their cell phones to facilitate easier gripping of an awkward rectangle with curled fingers. Having an awesome sense of humor helps too, as does doing a bit a research of developmental milestones for each year of age and not deviating more than one year on each task if possible.

**Kids born with physical challenges learn about their own limitations as they grow and before they develop any psychological hangups about being different so they just accept their condition as having "always been that way" and are open to discussing it with their peers. They also become aware of adults uneasiness and how a mutual realization of even temporarily extended dependency upon adult caregivers may be stressful both for short and long terms. These kids can to tend to ask questions designed to determine trustworthiness of adults upon whom they rely for assistance and benefit most when parents can keep some shared regular recreational activities in their lives, both for physical fitness and distraction and fun. Water play and flying kites can help, as can soccer as no one but goalies use their hands. It's also recommended to get outdoors for nature walks and time with pets or even large animals like horses. 

**It is also suggested that kids with this syndrome be encouraged to meet with, and have opportunities to talk to, others who have grown up with this specific condition, to share notes on ways to adapt and help others cope with the physical requirements, and to encourage them to consider all possibilities when making large life decisions. 

==Genetics==
Genetic research is underway.  A 2007 research article identified a region of [[chromosome]] 1, 1q21.1, containing 11 [[genes]] (including [[Hemojuvelin|HFE2]], [[LIX1L]], [[PIAS3]], [[ANKRD35]], [[ITGA10]], [[RBM8A]], [[PEX11B]], [[POLR3GL]], [[TXNIP]], and [[GNRR2]]), that is heterozygously deleted in thirty of thirty patients with TAR.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Klopocki E, Schulze H, Strauss G, ''et al.'' |title=Complex Inheritance Pattern Resembling Autosomal Recessive Inheritance Involving a Microdeletion in Thrombocytopenia–Absent Radius Syndrome |journal=Am. J. Hum. Genet. |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=232–40 |year=2007 |pmid=17236129 |pmc=1785342 |doi=10.1086/510919 |url=}}</ref> This deletion was also found in 32% of unaffected family members, so there are likely other genetic components of the syndrome besides this one, hence when a child has the condition any future siblings are likely to have a 25% chance of also having it.

==Epidemiology==
The incidence is 0.42 per 100,000 live births.

==History==
TAR was first identified in 1956, and was named almost thirteen years later when severe bruising (along with abnormally short forearms) was present in three families with nine newborns.
