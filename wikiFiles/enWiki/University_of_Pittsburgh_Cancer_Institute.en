The '''University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute''' ('''UPCI''') is a [[NCI-designated Cancer Center|National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center]] located in the Hillman Cancer Center in the [[Shadyside (Pittsburgh)|Shadyside]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. The only NCI-designated cancer center in [[Western Pennsylvania]], UPCI is composed of collaborative academic and research efforts between the [[University of Pittsburgh]], the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center|University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)]], and [[Carnegie Mellon University]].<ref name="aboutUPCI">{{cite web| url=http://www.upci.upmc.edu/about/index.cfm| title=University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute: About UPCI | publisher=University of Pittsburgh Medical Center | accessdate=2009-08-19}}</ref> UPCI works in tandem with UPMC Cancer Centers to provide clinical cancer care to some 74,000 patients treated at its facilities at both the flagship Hillman Cancer Center location and at dozens of UPMC-affiliated sites throughout the Pittsburgh region as well as at a growing list of overseas locations. Founded in 1984, UPCI became the youngest cancer center in history to achieve NCI-designation,<ref>{{cite journal

==Cancer Institute==
The UPCI was founded in 1984 under the direction of Ronald B. Herberman, MD.<ref name="welcome">{{cite web | url=http://www.upci.upmc.edu/about/welcome.cfm | title=University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute: Welcome | publisher=University of Pittsburgh Medical Center | accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> UPCI remains the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in Western Pennsylvania, and today is composed of 625 research faculty members specializing in disciplines ranging from cancer prevention and early detection to novel therapeutic discovery, survivorship, and end of life care. While most UPCI faculty maintain academic appointments at the University of Pittsburgh and physician-scientists maintain their clinical appointments through UPMC hospitals, some UPCI members are affiliated solely with UPMC or neighboring Carnegie Mellon University. Four target research areas of molecular and medical [[oncology]] at the institute include 1) the biological basis of cancer development and progression; 2) identification of new [[biomarkers]] for improved cancer detection and diagnosis; 3) the development of novel therapeutics for successful and comprehensive cancer treatment; and 4) establish and implement effect cancer prevention measures.<ref name="aboutUPCI" />  Over the last five years, UPCI's 350 faculty members have published more than 4,500 publications in peer-reviewed journals. 

UPCI is ranked 12th in funding from the National Cancer Institute. It has increased its federal research funding to a total of nearly $174 million in 2011; up from totals of $154 million in 2007, $149 million in 2004, and $120 million in 2001. These totals include three competitive Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) grants focusing on head and neck, lung, and skin cancers.  UPCI works in tandem with UPMC Cancer Centers Network to translate the latest research advances to clinical application for patients.  UPCI also offers a variety of  education, training programs and fellowships, in conjunction with related schools within the University of Pittsburgh, for both new cancer researchers to experienced investigators.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.upci.upmc.edu/education/index.cfm | title=University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute: Education and Training | publisher=University of Pittsburgh Medical Center | accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref> The current director of the UPCI and UPMC Cancer Centers is Nancy E. Davidson, MD.<ref name="welcome" />

==UPMC Cancer Centers==
UPMC Cancer Centers work in tandem with the UPCI to offer the latest advances in cancer prevention, detection, diagnosis, and treatment to patients at UPMC-affiliated locations throughout the Pittsburgh region and abroad.  The centers combine to create a network of more than 2,300 physicians, scientists, administrative staff, and other health care professionals that provide the latest care, technology, and treatments, as well as clinical trials, to over 36,000 patients each year.<ref name="welcome" /> UPMC centers encompass 13 areas of expertise, each focusing on a specific type or treatment of cancer. These include programs devoted to [[melanoma]], [[Brain tumor|brain cancers]], [[breast cancer]], [[Colorectal cancer|colon]] and [[Gastrointestinal cancer|gastrointestinal]] cancers, [[head and neck cancer]]s, [[leukemia]]s and [[lymphoma]]s, [[liver cancer]], [[lung cancer]], [[Gynecologic oncology|gynecologic cancers]], [[Prostate cancer|prostate]] and [[urology|urologic]] cancers, and [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|stem cell transplantation]]. [[Pediatrics|Pediatric]] cancers are treated by specialists at the [[Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC]].<ref name="UPMCCCabout">{{cite web | url=http://www.upmccancercenters.com/about/index.html | title=About UPMC Cancer Centers - Overview | accessdate=2009-08-26}}</ref>

===Locations===
The network works as a hub-and-satellite system of cancer care services at locations that are tied to the central hub and the flagship facility of the UPMC Cancer Centers Network and UPCI, the Hillman Cancer Center. The UPMC Cancer Centers Network covers a geographic area of more than {{convert|200|mi|km}} around greater Pittsburgh, comprising 180 affiliated [[oncologist]]s at over 30 locations throughout [[Western Pennsylvania]] and Ohio and includes a growing list of international locations starting in Dublin and Waterford, [[Ireland]] and a radiotherapy center in [[Rome]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upmccancercenter.com/about/pdf/CC_FastFacts_10-12_v1.pdf|title=UPMC Cancer Center and UPCI Fast Facts|publisher=upmccancercenter.com|year=2012|accessdate=January 17, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.upmccancercenters.com/network/listing.html | title=UPMC Cancer Centers -- Network Locations | accessdate=2009-08-19}}</ref> In November, 2008, UPMC announced a partnership with [[GE Healthcare]] to open 25 additional cancer treatment centers across [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] over the next ten years. <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=IRELAND-qqqm=news-qqqid=37750-qqqx=1.asp | title=UPMC planning to open 25 cancer centres outside Ireland | date=2008-11-23 | last=Mitchell | first=Susan | newspaper=The Sunday Business Post | location=Cork, Ireland | accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/34375549.html | title=GE, medical center team up to build cancer centers worldwide | date=2008-11-12 | last=Schmid | first=John | newspaper=Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel | accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>
