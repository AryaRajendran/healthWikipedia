'''AskDrWiki.com''' is an [[List_of_online_encyclopedias#Medicine_and_surgery|online medical wiki encyclopedia]] created by [[Cleveland Clinic]] Cardiology Fellows Kenny Civello and Brian Jefferson.  The project was started as a response to the lack of free online medical information found in several community hospitals and was created to form a repository of cardiovascular information that could be readily accessed for reference. With the assistance of other cardiovascular fellows Dr. Mike McWilliams and Dr. Shane Bailey, the site became a useful resource for commonly accessed medical information for other cardiologist and fellows in training. AskDrWiki's earliest article was August 21, 2006. The site now serves as a place to publish medical review articles, clinical notes, pearls, and medical images. The wiki allows anyone with a medical background to contribute or edit medical articles of which there are just over 1000 as of 2010.

===History===
In December 2006, AskDrWiki was referenced in Dean Giustini's [[British Medical Journal]] article How Web 2.0 is Changing Medicine<ref name="How Web 2.0 is Changing Medicine">[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7582/1283?ct "How Web 2.0 is Changing Medicine"]</ref> as one of the early adopters of using Video Hosting sites such as [[Youtube]] and [[Google video]] to host medical videos. AskDrWiki was then discussed in a [[Nature Medicine]] article discussing medical wikis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Keim|first=B|title=WikiMedia.|journal=Nature Medicine|date=2007 Mar|volume=13|issue=3|pages=231–3|pmid=17342106|doi=10.1038/nm0307-231}}</ref>  Since then AskDrWiki has been featured in other media including [[The Plain Dealer]],<ref>[http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/other/1175158085286060.xml&coll=2  A Wikipedia-style site for Medical Information]</ref> Medical Economics<ref>[http://www.memag.com/memag/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=421602 Wiki for Physicians Gains Foothold]</ref> and The [[American Medical Association]] News.<ref>[http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2007/05/07/bil20507.htm Physician Wikis:Do-it-Yourself Textbooks]</ref>

The purpose of the site is to provide reliable and easily accessed health information for the medical community including physicians, nurses, and medical students. The information published on the site is not meant to supersede medical training but to serve as a repository of medical review articles to give medical professionals an online source where they can review medical topics. The website is similar to [[Wikipedia]] because it runs on [[Mediawiki]] software allowing users to add and edit articles, but differs from Wikipedia because all users must be credentialed based on their medical training before they are allowed to publish. Its goal is not to compete with Wikipedia regarding consumer heath related topics, but to serve as an expert medical wiki and provide a source of up to date medical information for healthcare providers.
