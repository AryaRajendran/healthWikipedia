'''McBurney's point''' is the name given to the point over the right side of the [[abdomen]] that is one-third of the distance from the [[anterior superior iliac spine]] to the umbilicus. This point roughly corresponds to the most common location of the base of the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] where it is attached to the [[cecum]].<ref name="isbn0-7817-5309-0">{{cite book |author=Kyung Won, PhD.

Deep tenderness at McBurney's point, known as '''McBurney's sign''', is a sign of [[acute appendicitis]].<ref name="titleDefinition: McBurney's sign from Online Medical Dictionary">{{cite web |url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?McBurney's+sign |title=Definition: McBurney's sign from Online Medical Dictionary |accessdate=2007-12-06 |format= |work=}}</ref> 
The clinical sign of referred pain in the epigastrium when pressure is applied is also known as [[Aaron's sign]].  Specific localization of tenderness to McBurney's point indicates that inflammation is no longer limited to the lumen of the bowel (which localizes pain poorly), and is irritating the lining of the [[peritoneum]] at the place where the peritoneum comes into contact with the appendix. Tenderness at McBurney's point suggests the evolution of acute appendicitis to a later stage, and thus, the increased likelihood of rupture. Other abdominal processes can also sometimes cause tenderness at McBurney's point. Thus, this sign is highly useful but neither necessary nor sufficient to make a diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Also, the anatomical position of the appendix is highly variable (for example in retrocaecal appendix, an appendix behind the [[caecum]]), which also limits the use of this sign as many cases of appendicitis do not cause point tenderness at McBurney's point. For most open [[appendectomy|appendectomies]] (as opposed to [[laparoscopy|laparoscopic]] appendectomies), the incision is made at McBurney's point.

==Eponym==
The sign is named for American surgeon [[Charles McBurney (surgeon)|Charles McBurney]], (1845–1913).<ref>[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/572.html Charles McBurney (www.whonamedit.com)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In fact, McBurney himself did not locate "his" point in such a precise way in his original article.
