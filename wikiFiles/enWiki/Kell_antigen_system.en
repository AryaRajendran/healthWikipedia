The '''Kell antigen system''' (also known as '''Kell-Cellano system''') is a group of [[antigen]]s on the human red blood cell surface which are important determinants of [[blood type]] and are targets for [[autoimmune disease|autoimmune]] or [[alloimmunity|alloimmune]] diseases which destroy red blood cells. Kell can be noted as '''K''', '''k''', or '''Kp'''.<ref name="pmid13666821">{{cite journal | author = Kaita H, Lewis M, Chown B, Gard E | title = A further example of the Kell blood group phenotype K-,k-,Kp(a-b-) | journal = Nature | volume = 183 | issue = 4675 | pages = 1586 | year = 1959 | month = June | pmid = 13666821 | doi = 10.1038/1831586b0 | url = | issn = }}</ref><ref name="urlThe Kell blood group">{{cite web | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=rbcantigen&part=ch08Kell | title = The Kell blood group -- Blood Groups and Red Cell Antigens | author = Dean L | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = | format = | work = NCBI Bookshelf | publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information - United States National Institutes of Health | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-05-04}}</ref>  The Kell antigens are [[peptides]] found within the '''Kell protein''', a 93 [[kilodalton]] [[transmembrane]] [[zinc]]-dependent [[endopeptidase]] which is responsible for cleaving [[endothelin-3]].<ref name="pmid7849312">{{cite journal | author = Lee S, Wu X, Reid M, Zelinski T, Redman C | title = Molecular basis of the Kell (K1) phenotype | journal = Blood | volume = 85 | issue = 4 | pages = 912–6 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7849312 | doi = | issn = | url = http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/abstract/bloodjournal;85/4/912 }}</ref><ref name="pmid10438732">{{cite journal | author = Lee S, Lin M, Mele A, Cao Y, Farmar J, Russo D, Redman C | title = Proteolytic processing of big endothelin-3 by the kell blood group protein | journal = Blood | volume = 94 | issue = 4 | pages = 1440–50 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10438732 | doi = | issn = | url = http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/abstract/bloodjournal;94/4/1440 }}</ref>

== Protein ==

The ''KEL'' gene encodes a type II transmembrane [[glycoprotein]] that is the highly [[Polymorphism_(biology)#Genetic_polymorphism|polymorphic]] Kell blood group antigen. The Kell glycoprotein links via a single [[disulfide bond]] to the [[XK (protein)|XK membrane protein]] that carries the [[Kx antigen]]. The encoded protein contains sequence and structural similarity to members of the [[neprilysin]] (M13) family of [[zinc]] [[endopeptidase]]s.<ref name="entrez">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: KEL | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=3792| accessdate = }}</ref>

There are several [[allele]]s of the [[gene]] which creates Kell protein. Two such alleles, ''K<sub>1</sub>'' (Kell) and ''K<sub>2</sub>'' (Cellano), are the most common. The kell protein is tightly bound to a second protein, [[XK (protein)|XK]], by a [[disulfide bond]]. Absence of the XK protein (such as through [[genetic deletion]]), leads to marked reduction of the Kell antigens on the red blood cell surface. Absence of the Kell protein (K<sub>0</sub>), however, does not affect the XK protein.<ref name="pmid11134029">{{cite journal | author = Yu LC, Twu YC, Chang CY, Lin M | title = Molecular basis of the Kell-null phenotype: a mutation at the splice site of human KEL gene abolishes the expression of Kell blood group antigens | journal = J.

The Kell protein has also recently been designated '''CD238''' ([[cluster of differentiation]] 238).

== Disease association ==

Kell antigens are important in [[transfusion medicine]], [[autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] and [[hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-Kell)]]. Anti-K is the next most common immune red cell antibody after those in the ABO and Rh system. Anti-K typically presents as IgG class alloantibody. Individuals lacking a specific Kell antigen may develop [[antibody|antibodies]] against Kell antigens when transfused with blood containing that antigen. This is particularly true for the "K" antigen which shows a relatively high antigenicity and moderately low frequency (~9%) in Caucasian populations. Anti-K can also occur following transplacental hemorrhage (TPH) associated with childbirth making Kell an important concern for HDNB. Following the formation of anti-K, subsequent blood transfusions may be marked by destruction of the new cells by these antibodies, a process known as [[hemolysis]]. Anti-K does not bind complement, therefore hemolysis is extravascular. Individuals without K antigens(K<sub>0</sub>) who have formed an antibody to a K antigen, must be transfused with blood from donors who are also K<sub>0</sub> to prevent hemolysis.

[[Autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] (AIHA) occurs when the body produces an antibody against a blood group antigen on its own red blood cells. The antibodies lead to destruction of the red blood cells with resulting [[anemia]]. Similarly, a pregnant woman may develop antibodies against fetal red blood cells, resulting in destruction, anemia, and [[hydrops fetalis]] in a process known as [[Hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-Kell)|hemolytic disease of the newborn]] (HDN). Both AIHA and HDN may be severe when caused by anti-Kell antibodies,<ref name="pmid8623782">{{cite journal | author = Weiner CP, Widness JA | title = Decreased fetal erythropoiesis and hemolysis in Kell hemolytic anemia | journal = Am.

Gynecol. | volume = 174 | issue = 2 | pages = 547–51 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8623782 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9378(96)70425-8 }}</ref> as they are the most immunogenic antigens after those of the [[ABO blood group system|ABO]] and [[Rhesus blood group system]]s.

== McLeod phenotype ==

{{main|McLeod syndrome}}
McLeod phenotype (or McLeod syndrome) is an [[X-linked]] anomaly of the Kell blood group system in which Kell antigens are poorly detected by laboratory tests. The McLeod gene encodes the XK protein, a protein with structural characteristics of a membrane transport protein but an unknown function. The XK appears to be required for proper synthesis or presentation of the Kell antigens on the red blood cell surface.

== History ==

The Kell group was named after the first patient described with antibodies to K<sub>1</sub>, a pregnant woman named Mrs. Kellacher in 1945.<ref>Coombs RRA, Mourant AE, Race RR. ''A new test for the detection of weak and incomplete Rh agglutinins.'' Br J Exp Pathol 1945;26:255</ref> Mrs. Cellano was likewise a pregnant woman with the first described antibodies to K<sub>2</sub>. The K<sub>0</sub> [[phenotype]] was first described in 1957 and the McLeod phenotype was found in Hugh McLeod, a [[Harvard]] dental student, in 1961.<ref name="pmid13477267">{{cite journal | author = Chown B, Lewis M, Kaita K | title = A new Kell blood-group phenotype | journal = Nature | volume = 180 | issue = 4588 | pages = 711 | year = 1957 | pmid = 13477267 | doi = 10.1038/180711a0 }}</ref><ref name="pmid13860532">{{cite journal | author = Allen FH Jr, Krabbe SM, Corcoran PA | title = A new phenotype (McLeod) in the Kell blood-group system | journal = Vox Sang. | volume = 6 | issue = 5| pages = 555–60 | year = 1961 | pmid = 13860532 | doi = 10.1111/j.1423-0410.1961.tb03203.x }}</ref>
