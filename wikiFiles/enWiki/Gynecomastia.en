;[[Kidney failure]]:Renal failure patients often experience a state of malnutrition, which may contribute to gynecomastia development. Dialysis may attenuate malnutrition of renal failure. Additionally, many renal failure patients experience a hormonal imbalance due to the suppression of testosterone production and testicular damage from [[Uremia|high levels of urea]] also known as uremia-associated hypogonadism.<ref name="American"/><ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jnephrol.com/article/gonadal-dysfunction-in-men-with-chronic-kidney-disease--clinical-features--prognostic-implications-and-therapeutic-options-jnephrol-d-11-00024|last1=Iglesias|first1=P|last2=Carrero|first2=JJ|last3=Diez|first3=JJ|title=Gonadal dysfunction in men with chronic kidney disease: clinical features, prognostic implications and therapeutic options.|journal=Journal of Nephrology|volume=25|issue=1|pages=31–42 |year=2012|month=January-February|pmid=21748720|doi=10.5301/JN.2011.8481}}</ref>
;[[Liver failure]] and [[cirrhosis]]: In individuals with liver failure or cirrhosis, the liver's ability to properly metabolize hormones such as estrogen may be impaired.

;Malnutrition and starvation:When the human body is deprived of adequate nutrition, testosterone levels drop, but the liver's ability to degrade estrogen is diminished, causing a hormonal imbalance.

The causes of common gynecomastia remain uncertain, but are thought to result from an imbalance between the actions of estrogen and androgens at the breast tissue.<ref name="pathophys"/><ref name="Drugs"/> The imbalance in the estrogen:testosterone ratio results from increased estrogens or estrogenic precursors secondary to excess secretion by the testicles or adrenal glands; decreased androgens due to decreased secretion or increased metabolism by high levels of [[sex hormone-binding globulin]] (SHBG) in some cases may also play a role.<ref name="Cancer"/>  This mechanism has been the proposed cause of gynecomastia in certain associated conditions such as [[hyperthyroidism]], [[chronic liver disease]], and the use of certain medications such as spironolactone.<ref name="pathophys"/><ref>{{cite journal| last = Haynes| first=Bridgett| title=Male Gynecomastia|journal= Mayo Clinic Proceedings| year=2009|month=August|pmc=2719518|volume=84|issue=8|pmid=19648382|last2=Macadam| first2 = F  | pages = 672  | doi = 10.4065/84.8.672  | journal = Mayo Clinic proceedings.

Gynecomastia should also be distinguished from [[muscle hypertrophy]] of the [[Pectoralis major muscle|pectoralis]] muscles. When surgery is performed, the gland is routinely sent to the lab to confirm the presence of gynecomastia and to check for tumors under a microscope. The utility of pathologic examination of breast tissue removed from male adolescent gynecomastia patients has recently been questioned due to the rarity of breast cancer in this population.<ref name="Plastic"/> 

A review of the medications or illegal substances an individual takes may reveal the cause of gynecomastia.<ref name="American"/> Recommended laboratory investigations to find the underlying cause of gynecomastia include tests for [[aspartate transaminase]] and [[alanine transaminase]] to rule out liver pathology, serum [[creatinine]] to evaluate if kidney damage is present, and [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] levels to evaluate for hyperthyroidism. Medical imaging may be indicated in a subset of patients to rule out adrenal tumors, pituitary tumors, or male breast cancer.<ref name="Minimal"/> Additional tests that may be considered are markers of testicular, adrenal, or other tumors such as urinary [[17-ketosteroid]], serum beta [[human chorionic gonadotropin]], or serum [[dehydroepiandrosterone]].  Serum testosterone levels (free and total), [[estradiol]], [[luteinizing hormone]], and [[follicle stimulating hormone]] may also be evaluated to determine if hypogonadism may be the cause of gynecomastia.<ref name="American"/>

===Classification===
The spectrum of gynecomastia severity has been categorized into a grading system:<ref name="Minimal">{{cite journal|last1=Wollina | first1=U|last2=Goldman|first2=A| title=Minimally invasive esthetic procedures of the male breast|journal=Journal of cosmetic dermatology| year=2011| month=June| volume=10| issue=2| pages=150-155|pmid=21649820|doi=10.1111/j.1473-2165.2011.00548.x}}</ref>
* Grade I: Minor enlargement, no skin excess
* Grade II: Moderate enlargement, no skin excess
* Grade III: Moderate enlargement, skin excess
* Grade IV: Marked enlargement, skin excess

==Treatment==
Medical treatment of gynecomastia that has been present for over one year is usually futile. If chronic gynecomastia is treated, surgical removal of glandular breast tissue is usually required.<ref name="Drugs"/> Surgical approaches to the treatment of gynecomastia include subcutaneous mastectomy, liposuction-assisted mastectomy, laser-assisted liposuction, and laser-lipolysis without liposuction. Complications of mastectomy may include: [[hematoma]], surgical wound infection, male breast asymmetry, changes in sensation in the male breast, necrosis of the areola or nipple, [[seroma]], noticeable or painful scars, and contour deformities.<ref name="Minimal"/> 

[[Selective estrogen receptor modulator]]s may be beneficial in the treatment of gynecomastia, but are currently not approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] for use in gynecomastia.<ref name="Drugs"/> [[Aromatase inhibitor]]s such as [[testolactone]] have been approved for the treatment of gynecomastia in children and adolescents.<ref name="pediatrics">{{Cite journal|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/121/4/e975.long|last1=Shulman|first1=DI|last2=Francis|first2=GL|last3=Palmert|first3=MR|last4=Eugster|first4=EA|last5=Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society Drug and Therapeutics Committee |title=Use of aromatase inhibitors in children and adolescents with disorders of growth and adolescent development.||journal=Pediatrics|volume=121 |issue=4 |pages=e975-983 |year=2008|month=April |pmid=18381525 |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2081}}</ref> [[Tamoxifen]] may be used for painful gynecomastia in adults.<ref name="Drugs"/>

[[Radiation therapy]] and tamoxifen have been shown to help prevent gynecomastia and breast pain from developing in prostate cancer patients who will be receiving androgen deprivation therapy.

Gynecomastia is not physically harmful, but in some cases it may be an indicator of other more serious underlying conditions, such as testicular cancer.<ref name="Harrisons"/> Growing [[glandular tissue]], typically from some form of hormonal stimulation, is often tender or painful.
