'''Rumination syndrome''', or '''Merycism''', is an under-diagnosed chronic condition characterized by effortless [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]] of most meals following consumption.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.org/rumination-syndrome/ Rumination Syndrome — Diagnosis and Treatment Options at Mayo Clinic]</ref> There is no [[retching]], [[nausea]], [[heartburn]], odours, or abdominal pains associated with the regurgitation, as there is with typical [[vomiting]]. The disorder has been historically documented as affecting only [[pediatrics|infant]]s, [[pediatrics|young children]], and people with [[Developmental disability|cognitive disabilities]] (where the prevalence is as high as 10% in institutionalized patients with various mental disabilities).
Today it is being diagnosed in increasing numbers of otherwise healthy adolescents and adults, though there is a lack of awareness of the condition by doctors, patients and the general public.

Rumination syndrome presents itself in a variety of ways, especially when comparing an adult without a mental disability to an infant or to a mentally impaired individual. Like related GI disorders, rumination can adversely affect normal functioning and the social lives of individuals. It has been linked with depression.

There is little comprehensive data regarding rumination syndrome in otherwise healthy individuals.
Most people with the disorder are private about their illness, and are often misdiagnosed due to the number of symptoms, and the clinical similarities between rumination syndrome and other disorders of the stomach and esophagus, such as [[gastroparesis]] and [[bulimia nervosa]]. These include the acid-induced erosion of the [[esophagus]] and [[Tooth enamel|enamel]], [[halitosis]], [[malnutrition]], severe [[weight loss]] and an unquenchable appetite. Individuals may begin regurgitating within a minute following ingestion, and the full cycle of ingestion and regurgitation can mimic the [[binging and purging]] of bulimia.

Diagnosis of rumination syndrome is non-invasive, and based on a history of the individual. Treatment is promising, with upwards of 85% of individuals responding positively to treatment, including infants and the mentally handicapped.

== Classification ==
Rumination syndrome is a condition which affects the functioning of the [[stomach]] and [[esophagus]], also known as a ''functional gastroduodenal disorder.''<ref name="tacketal" /> It is grouped alongside other eating disorders such as bulimia and [[pica (disorder)|pica]], which are themselves grouped under non-psychotic mental disorder.<ref name="icd10f" /><ref name="icd10p" />

== Signs and symptoms ==

While the number and severity of symptoms varies among individuals, repetitive regurgitation of undigested food (known as rumination) after the start of a meal is always present.<ref name="pgradreview">{{citation

Unlike typical vomiting, the regurgitation is typically described as effortless and unforced.<ref name="pgradreview" /> There is seldom nausea preceding the expulsion, and the undigested food lacks the bitter taste and odour of [[stomach acid]] and [[bile]].<ref name="pgradreview" />

}}</ref> though the effects of it on rumination syndrome are unknown.<ref name="pgradreview" />

== Causes ==

The cause of rumination syndrome is unknown. However, studies have drawn a correlation between hypothesized causes and the history of patients with the disorder. In infants and the cognitively impaired, the disease has normally been attributed to over-stimulation and under-stimulation from parents and caregivers, causing the individual to seek self-gratification and self-stimulus due to the lack or abundance of external stimuli. The disorder has also commonly been attributed to a bout of illness, a period of stress in the individual's recent past, and to changes in medication.<ref name="pgradreview" />

In adults and adolescents, hypothesized causes generally fall into one of either category: habit-induced, and trauma-induced. Habit-induced individuals generally have a past history of bulimia nervosa or of intentional regurgitation (magicians and professional regurgitators, for example), which though initially self-induced, forms a subconscious habit that can continue to manifest itself outside the control of the affected individual. Trauma-induced individuals describe an emotional or physical injury (such as recent surgery, psychological distress, concussions, deaths in the family, etc.), which preceded the onset of rumination, often by several months.<ref name="pgradreview" /><ref name="nosology" />

== Diagnosis ==
Rumination syndrome is diagnosed based on a complete history of the individual. Costly and invasive studies such as gastroduodenal manometry and esophageal Ph testing are unnecessary and will often aid in misdiagnosis.<ref name="pgradreview" /> Based on typical observed features, several criteria have been suggested for diagnosing rumination syndrome.<ref name="nosology" /> The primary symptom, the regurgitation of recently ingested food, must be consistent, occurring for at least six&nbsp;weeks of the past twelve months. The regurgitation must begin within 30&nbsp;minutes of the completion of a meal. Patients may either chew the regurgitated matter or expel it. The symptoms must stop within 90&nbsp;minutes, or when the regurgitated matter becomes acidic. The symptoms must not be the result of a mechanical obstruction, and should not respond to the standard treatment for [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]].<ref name="pgradreview" />

In adults, the diagnosis is supported by the absence of classical or structural diseases of the gastrointestinal system. Supportive criteria include a regurgitant that does not taste sour or acidic,<ref name="emed" /> is generally odourless, is effortless,<ref name="mayosymptoms" /> or at most preceded by a belching sensation,<ref name="pgradreview" /> that there is no retching preceding the regurgitation,<ref name="pgradreview" /> and that the act is not associated with nausea or heartburn.<ref name="pgradreview" />

Patients visit an average of five physicians over 2.75 years before being correctly diagnosed with rumination syndrome.<ref name="bulimia">{{citation

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Rumination syndrome in adults is a complicated disorder whose symptoms can mimic those of several other gastroesophogeal disorders and diseases. Bulimia nervosa and gastroparesis are especially prevalent among the misdiagnoses of rumination.<ref name="pgradreview" />

[[Bulimia nervosa]], among adults and especially adolescents, is by far the most common misdiagnosis patients will hear during their experiences with rumination syndrome. This is due to the similarities in symptoms to an outside observer&mdash;"vomiting" following food intake&mdash;which, in long-term patients, may include ingesting copious amounts to offset malnutrition, and a lack of willingness to expose their condition and its symptoms. While it has been suggested that there is a connection between rumination and bulimia,<ref name="bulimia" /><ref name="obrien">{{citation

}}</ref> unlike bulimia, rumination is not self-inflicted. Adults and adolescents with rumination syndrome are generally well aware of their gradually increasing malnutrition, but are unable to control the reflex. In contrast, those with bulimia intentionally induce vomiting, and seldom re-swallow food.<ref name="pgradreview" />

[[Gastroparesis]] is another common misdiagnosis.<ref name="pgradreview" /> Like rumination syndrome, patients with gastroparesis often bring up food following the ingestion of a meal. Unlike rumination, gastroparesis causes [[vomiting]] (in contrast to [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]]) of food, which is not being digested further, from the stomach. This vomiting occurs several hours after a meal is ingested, preceded by nausea and retching, and has the bitter or sour taste typical of vomit.<ref name="mayosymptoms" />

== Pathophysiology ==
Rumination syndrome is a poorly understood disorder, and a number of theories have speculated the mechanisms that cause the regurgitation,<ref name="nosology" /> which is a unique symptom to this disorder. While no theory has gained a consensus, some are more notable and widely published than others.<ref name="pgradreview" />

The most widely documented mechanism is that the ingestion of food causes [[stomach|gastric]] distention, which is followed by abdominal compression and the simultaneous relaxation of the [[lower esophageal sphincter]] (LES). This creates a common cavity between the stomach and the [[oropharynx]] that allows the partially digested material to return to the mouth. There are several offered explanations for the sudden relaxation of the LES.<ref name="emed">

}}</ref> Among these explanations is that it is a learned voluntary relaxation, which is common in those with or having had bulimia. While this relaxation may be voluntary, the overall process of rumination is still generally involuntary. Relaxation due to intra-abdominal pressure is another proposed explanation, which would make abdominal compression the primary mechanism. The third is an adaptation of the belch reflex, which is the most commonly described mechanism. The swallowing of air immediately prior to regurgitation causes the activation of the belching reflex that triggers the relaxation of the LES. Patients often describe a feeling similar to the onset of a belch preceding rumination.<ref name="pgradreview" />

== Treatment and prognosis ==
There is presently no known cure for rumination. [[Proton pump inhibitors]] and other medications have been used to little or no effect.<ref name="breathingtech">{{citation

Treatment is different for infants and the mentally handicapped than for adults and adolescents of normal intelligence.
Among the former two, behavioral and mild aversive training has been shown to cause improvement in most cases.<ref name="aversive" /> Aversive training involves associating the ruminating behavior with negative results, and rewarding good behavior and eating. Placing a sour or bitter taste on the tongue when the individual begins the movements or breathing patterns typical of his or her ruminating behavior is the generally accepted method for aversive training,<ref name="aversive">{{citation

In patients of normal intelligence, rumination is not an intentional behavior and is habitually reversed using diaphragmatic breathing to counter the urge to regurgitate.<ref name="breathingtech" /> Alongside reassurance, explanation and habit reversal, patients are shown how to breathe using their [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragms]] prior to and during the normal rumination period.<ref name="breathingtech" /><ref>{{citation

Supportive therapy and diaphragmatic breathing has shown to cause improvement in 56% of cases, and total cessation of symptoms in an additional 30% in one study of 54 adolescent patients who were followed up 10 months after initial treatments.<ref name="nosology" /> Patients who successfully use the technique often notice an immediate change in health for the better.<ref name="breathingtech" /> Individuals who have had bulimia or who intentionally induced vomiting in the past have a reduced chance for improvement due to the reinforced behavior.<ref name="bulimia" /><ref name="breathingtech" /> The technique is not used with infants or young children due to the complex timing and concentration required for it to be successful.

Among the earliest cases of rumination was that of a physician in the nineteenth century, [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]], who acquired the condition as the result of experiments upon himself. As a way of evaluating and testing the acid response of the stomach to various foods, the doctor would swallow sponges tied to a string, then intentionally regurgitate them to analyze the contents. As a result of these experiments, the doctor eventually regurgitated his meals habitually by reflex.<ref>{{citation

Numerous case reports exist from before the twentieth century, but were influenced greatly by the methods and thinking used in that time. By the early twentieth century, it was becoming increasingly evident that rumination presented itself in a variety of ways in response to a variety of conditions.<ref name="kolden" /> Although still considered a disorder of infancy and cognitive disability at that time, the difference in presentation between infants and adults was well established.<ref name="historiccases" />

Studies of rumination in otherwise healthy adults became decreasingly rare starting in the 1900s, and the majority of published reports analyzing the syndrome in mentally healthy patients appeared thereafter. At first, adult rumination was described and treated as a benign condition. It is now described as otherwise.<ref>{{citation
