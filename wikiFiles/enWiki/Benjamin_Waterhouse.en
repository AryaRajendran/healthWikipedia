==Biography==
===Early life===

Waterhouse was born into a [[Quaker]] family, although he never adopted the religion as his own.<ref name="brown.edu">[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=W0070 Encyclopedia Brunoniana | Waterhouse, Benjamin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> His parents were Timothy Waterhouse, a chair maker who also served on the Governor's Council, and Hannah Waterhouse.<ref name="faqs.org">[http://www.faqs.org/health/bios/70/Benjamin-Waterhouse.html Benjamin Waterhouse Biography (1754-1846)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> His medical career began at age 16, when he apprenticed for a doctor in his hometown. At age 21, he left the United States to study medicine in Europe at several notable institutions, such as with Dr. [[John Fothergill (physician)|John Fothergill]] in [[London, England]]. He was also educated in [[Edinburgh]] at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]] and [[Leyden]], where he received his medical degree.

===Medical career===
After returning to the United States in 1782, Waterhouse joined the faculty of the new medical school at Harvard as one of three professors, including [[John Warren (surgeon)|John Warren]] and Aaron Dexter, in the area of Theory and Practice of Physic. He was also elected that same year as a Fellow at [[Brown University|Rhode Island College]] (now "Brown University").<ref name="brown.edu"/> In 1814, Waterhouse resigned his Harvard professorship after opposing a plan to establish the Medical School in Boston and attempting to found a rival medical school.<ref name="brown.edu"/> He was a strong supporter of [[Samuel Thomson]]'s medical system throughout the 1820s.

====Smallpox vaccine====
Waterhouse first wrote to then-President [[John Adams]], his former roommate, hoping to spread the word about cowpox vaccinations preventing smallpox.  When he found President Adams unresponsive, he wrote a letter to Vice President [[Thomas Jefferson]] entitled "A prospect of exterminating the smallpox."<ref name="historyofvaccines.org">{{cite web|url= http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/timelines/smallpox#EVT_000055| title = History of Vaccines Website – Waterhouse Brings Vaccination to the States | date=3 November 2010 | accessdate=3 November 2010| publisher=[[College of Physicians of Philadelphia]]}}</ref>
	
Jefferson replied with a letter dated Christmas Day, 1800, and soon offered his support. Once Jefferson became President the following year, Waterhouse introduced [[Edward Jenner]]'s method of cowpox vaccination in the United States.<ref name="historyofvaccines.org"/> He attempted to maintain a monopoly over the cowpox vaccine, for both financial reasons and to protect the vaccine from incompetent or fraudulent physicians. Waterhouse made the first vaccinations in the United States on four of his children. He commissioned a controlled experiment at the Boston Board of Health in which 19 vaccinated and 2 unvaccinated boys were exposed to the smallpox virus. The vaccinated boys demonstrated immunity and the 2 unvaccinated boys succumbed to the disease.<ref name="faqs.org"/>

===Personal life===
In 1788, he married Elizabeth Oliver, with whom he had six children. She died in childbirth in 1815. In 1819, he married Louisa Lee; no children resulted from this marriage.<ref name="faqs.org"/>

===Death and Legacy===

He died in his home in Cambridge in 1846, and was survived by his wife Louisa. He is interred at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]], where Louisa erected a small monument in his honor. He is the subject of a biography entitled ''Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse: A Life in Medicine and Public Service (1754—1846)'' by Philip Cash. His portrait hangs at the Harvard Medical School and his house on Waterhouse Street near [[Cambridge Common]] bears a plaque commemorating his introduction of the smallpox vaccine in the United States.<ref name="hno.harvard.edu"/>

Waterhouse's work with the smallpox vaccine was dramatized in a 1964 episode of the historical anthology series ''[[The Great Adventure (TV series)|The Great Adventure]]''.  He was portrayed by [[Robert Cummings]].
