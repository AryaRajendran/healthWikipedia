'''Danubian endemic familial nephropathy''' (DEFN), also called '''Balkan endemic nephropathy''',<ref>{{OMIM|124100}}</ref> is a form of [[interstitial nephritis]]. It was first identified in the 1920s among several small, discrete communities along the [[Danube]] River and its major tributaries, in the modern countries of [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]], [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]].

==History==
The first official publication was made by the Bulgarian nephrologist Dr. Yoto Tanchev and his team in 1956 in the Bulgarian Journal ''Savremenna Medizina'',<ref>Tanchev Y, Evstatiev Z, Dorossiev D, Pencheva J, Tzvetkova G. Studies on the nephritides in the District of Vratza. ''Savremena Medicina'' 1956; 7: 14–29 (Bulgarian).</ref> a priority generally acknowledged by the international nephrological community.<ref name="Tanchev & Dorossiev">{{cite journal |author=Tanchev Y, Dorossiev D |title=The first clinical description of Balkan endemic nephropathy (1956) and its validity 35 years later |journal=IARC Sci. Publ. |volume= |issue=115 |pages=21–8 |year=1991 |pmid=1820335 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Their study was based on a wide screening of inhabitants of the villages around the town of [[Vratsa]], [[Bulgaria]]. Their contribution to the study of this unusual endemic disease of the kidneys consisted in the description of symptoms which were not typical for the common chronic nephritis, i.e., incidence only in adults (no children affected), lack of high blood pressure, [[xanthochromia]] of palms and soles (Tanchev's sign), early [[hypochromic anemia]], a lack of [[proteinuria]], and slow progression of [[kidney failure]].

A striking feature of the disease is its very localized occurrence. There are approximately ten small areas where it occurs, all of them more or less rural, but nothing seems to connect those areas, other than the occurrence of this illness. Tanchev and colleagues suggested the condition was a disease ''[[sui generis]]''. Their initial hypothesis for the etiology was possible intoxication with [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s, because the villages affected were supplied with water coming from the nearby [[karst]]-type [[Vratsa Mountain]].

The first name of the disease was "Vratsa nephritis". Later, following descriptions of similar ailments in [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Romania]], the condition became known as Balkan endemic nephropathy.<ref name="Tanchev & Dorossiev"/>

In the Balkan region, dietary aristolochic acid exposure may come from ''[[Aristolochia clematitis]]'', or European birthwort, a plant native to the endemic region, and its seeds may comingle with wheat used for bread.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grollman AP, Shibutani S, Moriya M, ''et al.'' |title=Aristolochic acid and the etiology of endemic (Balkan) nephropathy |journal=Proc.
