The '''N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide''' ('''NT-proBNP''') is a 76 amino acid [[N-terminal]] fragment of [[brain natriuretic peptide]].

Both BNP and NT-proBNP levels in the blood are used for screening, diagnosis of acute [[congestive heart failure]] (CHF) and may be useful to establish prognosis in heart failure, as both markers are typically higher in patients with worse outcome.<ref name="pmid14872150">{{cite journal | author = Bhalla V, Willis S, Maisel AS | title = B-type natriuretic peptide: the level and the drug--partners in the diagnosis of congestive heart failure | journal = Congest Heart Fail | volume = 10 | issue = 1 Suppl 1 | pages = 3–27 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14872150 | doi = 10.1111/j.1527-5299.2004.03310.x }}</ref> The plasma concentrations of both BNP and NT-proBNP are also typically increased in patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction and is associated with coronary artery diasese and myocardial ischemia. <ref name="pmid15389242">{{cite journal | author = Atisha D, Bhalla MA, Morrison LK, Felicio L, Clopton P, Gardetto N, Kazanegra R, Chiu A, Maisel AS | title = A prospective study in search of an optimal B-natriuretic peptide level to screen patients for cardiac dysfunction | journal = Am.

In screening for [[congenital heart disease]] in pediatric patients, an NT-proBNP cut-off value of 91 pg/mL could differentiate an [[acyanotic heart disease]] (ACNHD) patient from a healthy patient with a [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of 84% and [[sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] of 42%.<ref name=Moses2011/> On the other hand, an NT-proBNP cut-off value of 318 pg/mL is more appropriate in differing patients with [[congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic disease]] (CNHD) from healthy patients, with 94% sensitivity and 97% specificity.<ref name=Moses2011/> An NT-proBNP value of 408 pg/mL has been estimated to be 83% sensitive and 57% specific in differentiating patients with ACNHD from patients with CNHD<ref name=Moses2011>{{cite journal | author = Moses EJ, Mokhtar SAI, Hamzah A, Abdullah BS, Yusoff NM | title = Usefulness of N-Terminal-Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide as a Screening Tool for Identifying Pediatric Patients With Congenital Heart Disease | journal = Laboratory Medicine | year=2011 | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 75–80 | doi = 10.1309/LMW0U87COTHXGELF }}</ref>
