'''Paramyotonia Congenita''' (PC), also known as '''Paramyotonia congenita of von Eulenburg''' or '''Eulenburg disease''',<ref>[http://www.mdausa.org/publications/fa-myop-qa2.html Facts About Myopathies | MDA Publications<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> is a rare congenital [[autosomal dominant]] neuromuscular disorder characterized by “paradoxical” [[myotonia]].<ref name="Eulenburg_1886">Eulenburg A (1886) Über eine familiäre durch 6 Generationen verfolgbare Form kongenitaler Paramyotonie. ''Neurol. Zentralbl.'' '''12''':265-72.</ref> This type of [[myotonia]] has been termed paradoxical because it becomes worse with exercise whereas classical myotonia, as seen in [[myotonia congenita]], is alleviated by exercise. PC is also distinguished as it can be induced by cold temperatures. Although more typical of the [[periodic paralysis|periodic paralytic disorders]], patients with PC may also have potassium provoked paralysis. PC typically presents within the first decade of life and has 100% penetrance. Patients with this disorder commonly present with myotonia in the face or upper extremities. The lower extremities are generally less affected. While some other related disorders result in [[Atrophy#Muscle atrophies|muscle atrophy]], this is not normally the case with PC. This disease can also present as [[hyperkalemic periodic paralysis]] and there is debate as to whether the two disorders are actually distinct.<ref Name="De_Silva_1990">{{cite journal | author = de Silva S, Kuncl R, Griffin J, Cornblath D, Chavoustie S | title = Paramyotonia congenita or hyperkalemic periodic paralysis?

==Symptoms and signs==
Patients typically complain of muscle stiffness that can continue to focal weakness. This muscle stiffness cannot be walked-off, in contrast to [[myotonia congenita]]. These symptoms are increased (and sometimes induced) in cold environments. For example, some patients have reported that eating ice cream leads to a stiffening of the throat. For other patients, exercise consistently induces symptoms of myotonia and/or weakness. Typical presentations of this are during squating or repetitive fist clenching. Some patients also indicate that specific foods are able to induce symptoms of paramyotonia congenita. Isolated cases have reported that [[carrot]]s and [[watermelon]] are able to induce these symptoms. The canonical definition of this disorder precludes permanent weakness in the definition of this disorder. In practice, however, this has not been strictly adhered to in the literature.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of paramyotonia congenita is made upon evaluation of patient symptoms and case history. Myotonia must increase with exercise/movement and usually must worsen in cold temperatures. Patients that present with permanent weakness are normally not characterized as having PC. [[Electromyography]] may be used to distinguish between paramyotonia congenita and myotonia congenita.<ref name="Subramony_1983">{{cite journal | author = Subramony S, Malhotra C, Mishra S | title = Distinguishing paramyotonia congenita and myotonia congenita by electromyography. | journal = Muscle Nerve | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 374–9 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6888415 | doi = 10.1002/mus.880060506}}</ref><sup>,</sup><ref name="Streib_1984">{{cite journal | author = Streib E | title = Evoked response testing in myotonic syndromes. | journal = Muscle Nerve | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 590–2 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6544373 | doi = 10.1002/mus.880070709 | last2 = Lane | first2 = Russell J.

Genomic sequencing of the SCN4A gene is the definitive diagnostic determinant.

==Pathophysiology==
Paramyotonia congenita (as well as [[hyperkalemic periodic paralysis]] and the [[potassium-aggravated myotonia]]s) is caused by mutations in a [[sodium channel]], [[SCN4A]]. The phenotype of patients with these mutations is indicated in Table 1. These mutations affect fast inactivation of the encoded sodium channel. There are also indications that some mutations lead to altered activation and deactivation. The result of these alterations in channel kinetics is that there is prolonged inward (depolarizing) current following muscle excitation. There is also the introduction of a “window current” due to changes in the voltage sensitivity of the channel’s kinetics. These lead to a general increase in cellular excitability, as shown in figure 1. [[Image:Myotonia figure.png|thumb|right|'''Figure 1.''' Theoretical simulation of a muscle membrane potential in response to 150ms depolarizing pulse of -45pA. (A) Normal muscle produces only a single action potential due to such stimulus. This is due to inactivation of sodium channels, preventing their further activation even during depolarization. (B) Myotonic muscle, however, is hyperexcitable and able to produce action potentials for the duration of the stimulus pulse. This model adapted from Cannon, 1993.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cannon S, Brown R, Corey D | title = Theoretical reconstruction of myotonia and paralysis caused by incomplete inactivation of sodium channels. | journal = Biophys J | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 270–88 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8396455 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(93)81045-2 | pmc = 1225722}}</ref>]]

There has been one study of a large number of patients with paramyotonia congenita. Of 26 kindreds, it found that 17 (71%) had a mutation in SCN4A while 6 (29%) had no known mutation. There is no large difference between these two groups except that patients with no known mutation have attacks precipitated less by cold but more by hunger, are much more likely to have normal muscle biopsies, and show less decreased compound muscle action potentials when compared to patients with known mutations.<ref name="Miller_2004">{{cite journal | author = Miller T, Dias da Silva M, Miller H, Kwiecinski H, Mendell J, Tawil R, McManis P, Griggs R, Angelini C, Servidei S, Petajan J, Dalakas M, Ranum L, Fu Y, Ptácek L | title = Correlating phenotype and genotype in the periodic paralyses. | journal = Neurology | volume = 63 | issue = 9 | pages = 1647–55 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15534250}}</ref>

Likewise, "Exercise/Activity" refers to symptom onset or severity worsening with exercise and/or more general movement like hand clenching. "Potassium" refers to ingestion of food high in potassium or other disorders which are known to increase serum potassium levels. Mutation region nomenclature is: domain number (e.g., D1) followed by segment number (e.g., S4). Thus, D2S3 indicates that the mutation is in the 3rd membrane spanning loop of the 2nd domain. Some mutations occur between segments and are denoted similarly (e.g., D4S4-S5 occurs between the 4th and 5th segments of the 4th domain). Other mutations are located between domains and are denoted DX-Y where X and Y are domain numbers. C-term refers to the carboxy-terminus.

==Treatment/Management==
Some patients do not require treatment to manage the symptoms of paramyotonia congenita. Others, however, require treatment for their muscle stiffness and often find mexiletine to be helpful. Others have found acetazolamide to be helpful as well. Avoidance of myotonia triggering events is also an effective method of mytonia prevention.

==Epidemiology==
Paramyotonia congenita is considered an extremely rare disorder, though little epidemiological work has been done. Prevalence is generally higher in European derived populations and lower among Asians. Epidemiological estimates have been provided for the [[Germany|German]] population. Here, it was estimated that the prevalence of PC is between 1:350,000 (0.00028%) and 1:180,000 (0.00056%).<ref name="Meyer-kleine_1994"/> It should be noted, however, that the German population of patients with PC is not uniformly distributed across the country. Many individuals with PC herald from the [[Ravensberg Land|Ravensberg]] area in North-West Germany, where a [[founder effect]] is seems to be responsible for most cases.<ref name="Meyer-kleine_1994"/><ref name="Becker_1970">Becker PE, Paramyotonia congenita (Eulenberg) in ''Fortschritte der allgemeinen und klinischen Humangenetik''. Thieme, Stuttgart (1970).</ref> The prevalence here is estimated at 1:6000 or 0.017%.

==History==
Originally thought to be separate from hyperkalemic periodic paralysis and the sodium channel myotonias, there is now considerable disagreement as to whether these disorders represent separate entities or overlapping phenotypes of a complex disorder spectrum. It was once thought that Paramyotonia congenita was more common in males. Observation of the most recent generation has shown this to be untrue. On average of half of children in a family inherit the disorder regardless of gender. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=GM|coauthors=Kim, JB|title=Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis and paramyotonia congenita caused by a de novo mutation in the SCN4A gene|journal=Neurology Asia|year=2011|month=June|volume=16|issue=2|pages=163–6}}</ref>
