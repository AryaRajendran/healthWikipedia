'''Degranulation''' is a cellular process that releases [[antimicrobial]] [[cytotoxic]] molecules from [[secretion|secretory]] [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s called [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]] found inside some cells.   It is used by several different cells involved in the [[immune system]], including [[granulocytes]] ([[neutrophil]]s, [[basophil]]s and [[eosinophil]]s) and [[mast cell]]s, and certain [[lymphocyte]]s such as [[natural killer cell|natural killer (NK) cells]] and [[cytotoxic T cell]]s, whose main purpose is to destroy invading microorganisms.

==Mast cells==
[[Antigens]] interact with [[IgE]] molecules already bound to high affinity [[Fc receptor]]s on the surface of [[mast cell]]s to induce degranulation. The mast cell releases a mixture of compounds, including [[histamine]], [[proteoglycan]]s and [[serine protease]]s, from its cytoplasmic granules.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yamasaki S, Saito T |title=Regulation of mast cell activation through FcepsilonRI |journal=Chem Immunol Allergy |volume=87 |issue= |pages=22–31 |year= 2005|pmid=16107760 |doi=10.1159/000087568 |series=Chemical Immunology and Allergy |isbn=3-8055-7948-9}}</ref>  

==Eosinophils==
In a similar mechanism, activated eosinophils release preformed mediators such as [[major basic protein]], and [[enzyme]]s such as [[peroxidase]], following interaction between their Fc receptors and IgE molecules that are bound to large [[parasite]]s like [[helminth]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=David J, Butterworth A, Vadas M |title=Mechanism of the interaction mediating killing of Schistosoma mansoni by human eosinophils |journal=Am J Trop Med Hyg |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=842–8 |year=1980 |pmid=7435788}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Capron M, Soussi Gounni A, Morita M, Truong M, Prin L, Kinet J, Capron A |title=Eosinophils: from low- to high-affinity immunoglobulin E receptors |journal=Allergy |volume=50 |issue=25 Suppl |pages=20–23 |year=1995 |pmid=7677229 |doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.1995.tb04270.x}}</ref>

==Neutrophils==
Four kinds of granules exist in neutrophils that display differences in content and regulation. Secretory vesicles are the most likely to release their contents by degranulation, followed by [[gelatinase]] granules, [[specific granule]]s, and [[azurophil]] granules.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Faurschou M, Borregaard N |title=Neutrophil granules and secretory vesicles in inflammation |journal=Microbes Infect |volume=5 |issue=14 |pages=1317–1327 |year=2003 |pmid=14613775 |doi=10.1016/j.micinf.2003.09.008}}</ref>

==Cytotoxic T cells and NK cells==
Cytotoxic T cells and NK cells release  molecules like [[perforin]] and [[granzyme]]s by
a process of directed [[exocytosis]] to kill infected target cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Veugelers K, Motyka B, Frantz C, Shostak I, Sawchuk T, Bleackley R |title=The granzyme B-serglycin complex from cytotoxic granules requires dynamin for endocytosis |journal=Blood |volume=103 |issue=10 |pages=3845–3853 |year=2004 |pmid=14739229 |doi=10.1182/blood-2003-06-2156}}</ref>
