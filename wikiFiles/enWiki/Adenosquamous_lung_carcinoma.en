'''Adenosquamous lung carcinoma''' (AdSqLC) is a biphasic [[malignant]] [[tumor]] arising from lung tissue that is composed of at least 10% by volume each of squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) and adenocarcinoma (AdC) cells.<ref name='who2004'>{{Cite book|title=Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart |editor1-last=Travis |editor1-first=William D |editor2-last=Brambilla |editor2-first=Elisabeth |editor3-last=Muller-Hermelink |editor3-first=H Konrad |editor4-last=Harris |editor4-first=Curtis C |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |year=2004 |series=World Health Organization Classification of Tumours |isbn=92-832-2418-3 |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/pdfs-online/pat-gen/bb10/bb10-cover.pdf |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>

==Classification==
Lung cancers have been historically classified using two major paradigms. [[Histological]] classification systems group lung cancers according to the appearance of the cells and surrounding tissues when they are viewed under a microscope. [[Illness|Clinical]] classification systems divide lung cancers into groups based on medical criteria, particularly their response to different treatment regimens.

Before the mid-1900s, lung cancer was considered to be a single disease entity, with all forms treated similarly. In the 1960s, [[small cell lung carcinoma]] (SCLC) was recognized as a unique form of lung cancer, based both on its appearance ([[histology]]) and its [[Illness|clinical]] properties, including much greater susceptibility to [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiation]], more rapid growth rate, and its propensity to metastasize widely early on in its course. Since then, most [[oncologists]] have based patient treatment decisions on a dichotomous division of lung cancers into SCLC and [[non-small cell lung carcinomas]] (NSCLC), with the former being treated primarily with chemoradiation, and the latter with surgery. 

An explosion of new knowledge, accumulated mainly over the last 20 years, has proved that lung cancers should be considered an extremely [[heterogeneous]] family of [[neoplasms]]<ref name='RoggliVollmer'>{{cite journal |author=Roggli VL, Vollmer RT, Greenberg SD, McGavran MH, Spjut HJ, Yesner R |title=Lung cancer heterogeneity: a blinded and randomized study of 100 consecutive cases |journal=Hum.

Well over 50 different histological variants are now recognized under the 2004 revision of the [[World Health Organization]] ("WHO-2004") typing system, currently the most widely used lung cancer classification scheme.<ref name='who2004' /> Recent studies have shown beyond doubt that the old clinical classification paradigm of "SCLC vs. NSCLC" is now obsolete, and that correct "subclassification" of lung cancer cases is necessary to assure that lung cancer patients receive optimum management.<ref name='RossiMarchioni'>{{cite journal |author=Rossi G, Marchioni A, Sartori1 G, Longo L, Piccinini S, Cavazza A |title=Histotype in non-small cell lung cancer therapy and staging: The emerging role of an old and underrated factor |journal=Curr Resp Med Rev |volume=3 |pages=69–77 |year=2007 |doi=10.2174/157339807779941820 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/crmr/2007/00000003/00000001/art00011}}</ref><ref name='Vincent'>{{cite journal |author=Vincent MD |title=Optimizing the management of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a personal view |journal=Curr Oncol |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=9–21 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19672420 |pmc=2722061 |url=http://www.current-oncology.com/index.php/oncology/article/view/465/374; |doi=10.3747/co.v16i4.465}}</ref>

Approximately 98% of lung cancers are [[carcinoma]], which are tumors composed of cells with [[epithelial]] characteristics.<ref name='TravisTravis'>{{cite journal |author=Travis WD, Travis LB, Devesa SS |title=Lung cancer |journal=Cancer |volume=75 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=191–202 |year=1995 |month=January |pmid=8000996 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19950101)75:1+<191::AID-CNCR2820751307>3.0.CO;2-Y}}</ref> LCLC's are one of 8 major groups of lung carcinomas recognized in WHO-2004:<ref name='who2004'>{{cite book |title=Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart |editor1-last=Travis |editor1-first=William D |editor2-last=Brambilla |editor2-first=Elisabeth |editor3-last=Muller-Hermelink |editor3-first=H Konrad |editor4-last=Harris |editor4-first=Curtis C |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |year=2004 |series=World Health Organization Classification of Tumours |isbn=92-832-2418-3 |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/pdfs-online/pat-gen/bb10/bb10-cover.pdf |accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref>
