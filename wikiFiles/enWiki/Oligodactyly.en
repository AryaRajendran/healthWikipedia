'''Oligodactyly'''  (from Greek prefix oligo-, "having few, having little" + δάκτυλος (daktulos) "finger") in [[human]]s is "the presence of fewer than five fingers or toes on a hand or foot".<ref>[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=oligodactyly NIH website], citing ''Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary''.

Accessed February 16, 2010</ref> It is quite often incorrectly called ''hypodactyly'', but the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] prefixes [[wiktionary:hypo-|hypo-]] and [[wiktionary:hyper-|hyper-]] are used for [[wiktionary:continuous|continuous]] scales (e.g. in [[hypoglycaemia]] and [[hypercholesterolemia]]). This as opposed to [[wiktionary:discrete|discrete]] or [[wiktionary:countable|countable]] scales, where [[wiktionary:oligo-|oligo-]] and [[wiktionary:poly-|poly-]] should be used (e.g. in [[oligarchy]] and [[polygamy]]). Oligodactyly is therefore the opposite of [[polydactyly]].<ref name="MedTerm" /><ref name=Journal>[http://www.journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/yjssh/article/PIIS1531091402500206/abstract].

Oligodactyly is sometimes a sign or symptom of several syndromes including [[Poland syndrome]] and Weyer Ulnar Ray Syndrome.<ref>P D Turnpenny, J C Dean, P Duffty, J A Reid, and P Carter, "Weyers' ulnar ray/oligodactyly syndrome and the association of midline malformations with ulnar ray defects." J Med Genet. 1992 September; 29(9): 659–662.  Found at [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1016100/ NIH website].  Accessed last on February 17, 2010.</ref>  It is a type of [[Dysmelia]].

[[Ectrodactyly]] is an extreme instance of oligodactyly, involving the absence of one or more central digits of the hand or foot and is also known as split hand/split foot malformation (SHFM).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moerman|first= P.|last2=Fryns |first2=J.P.|title=Ectodermal dysplasia, Rapp-Hodgkin type in a mother and severe ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting syndrome (EEC) in her child|journal=[[American Journal of Medical Genetics]] Part A.| volume=63 |issue=3 |year=1998 |pages=479–81|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-8628(19960614)63:3<479::AID-AJMG12>3.0.CO;2-J |pmid=8737656}}</ref> The hands and feet of people with ectrodactyly are often described as "claw-like" and may include only the thumb and one finger (usually either the little finger, ring finger, or a syndactyly of the two) with similar abnormalities of the feet.<ref>{{cite book| last=Peterson-Falzone|first=Sally J.|last2=Hardin-Jones |first2=Mary A.| last3=Karnell| first3=Michael P.| last4=McWilliams |first4=Betty Jane |year=2001 |title=Cleft Palate Speech|publisher=Mosby |ISBN=978-0-8151-3153-3}}</ref>

Perhaps surprisingly, people with oligodactyly often have full use of the remaining digits and adapt well to their condition. Outside the occasional [[staring|stare]], they are not greatly hindered in their daily activities, if at all.<ref name="Jones"/><ref name="Lewis">{{cite journal| last=Lewis |first=Thomas | title=The Inheritance of Deformities |journal=[[British Medical Journal]] | volume=2 |issue=2481 |year=1908 |pages=166–173| doi=10.1136/bmj.2.2481.166}}</ref> Even those with the most extreme forms are known to engage in tasks that require fine control, such as writing<ref name="Jones"/> and bootmaking<ref name="Lewis"/> as well as working as a [[taxicab|cab]] driver.<ref name="Lewis"/>

[[Doma people|Vadoma people]] of [[Zimbabwe]] have a high frequency of oligodactyly.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Farrell HB |title=The two-toed Wadoma--familial ectrodactyly in Zimbabwe |journal=S.
