'''Topiramate''' (brand name '''Topamax''') is an [[anticonvulsant]] (antiepilepsy) drug.  It was most recently approved for '''weight loss''' by the FDA in combination with phentermine.  It has been used off-label for this purpose before FDA approval was obtained.  It was originally produced by [[Ortho-McNeil Neurologics]] and Noramco, Inc., both divisions of the [[Johnson & Johnson]] Corporation. It was also recently approved in a combination medication used for weight loss in late 2012.  This medication was discovered in 1979 by [[Bruce E. Maryanoff]] and Joseph F. Gardocki during their research work at McNeil Pharmaceutical.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maryanoff |first1=BE |last2=Nortey |first2=SO |last3=Gardocki |first3=JF |last4=Shank |first4=RP |last5=Dodgson |first5=SP |title=Anticonvulsant O-alkyl sulfamates. 2,3:4,5-Bis-O-(1-methylethylidene)-beta-D-fructopyranose sulfamate and related compounds |journal=Journal of Medical Chemistry |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=880–7 |year=1987 |pmid=3572976 |doi=10.1021/jm00388a023}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maryanoff |first1=BE |last2=Costanzo |first2=MJ |last3=Nortey |first3=SO |last4=Greco |first4=MN |last5=Shank |first5=RP |last6=Schupsky |first6=JJ |last7=Ortegon |first7=MP |last8=Vaught |first8=JL |title=Structure-activity studies on anticonvulsant sugar sulfamates related to topiramate.

==Medical uses==
Topiramate is used to treat [[epilepsy]] in children and adults, and it was originally used as an [[anticonvulsant]]. In children, it is indicated for the treatment of [[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]], a disorder that causes seizures and developmental delay. It is also [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved for, and most frequently prescribed for, the prevention of [[migraine]]s. [[Psychiatrist]]s have used topiramate to treat [[bipolar disorder]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arnone |first1=D |title=Review of the use of Topiramate for treatment of psychiatric disorders |journal=Annals of general psychiatry |volume=4 |issue=1 |page=5 |year=2005 |pmid=15845141 |pmc=1088011 |doi=10.1186/1744-859X-4-5}}</ref> and they sometimes use topiramate to augment psychotropics, or to counteract the weight gain associated with numerous antidepressants. In 2006, a [[Cochrane review]] concluded that there is insufficient evidence on which to base any recommendations regarding the use of topiramate in any phase of bipolar illness.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vasudev |first1=Kamini |last2=MacRitchie |first2=Karine |last3=Geddes |first3=John |last4=Watson |first4=Stuart |last5=Young |first5=Allan H |last6=Young |first6=Allan H |editor1-last=Young |editor1-first=Allan H |title=Topiramate for acute affective episodes in bipolar disorder |year=2006 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003384.pub2 |pmid=16437453 |issue=1 |pages=CD003384 |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)}}</ref> A more recent [[Cochrane review]], published in 2010, suggested a benefit of topiramate in the treatment of symptoms of [[borderline personality disorder]], however the authors note that this was based only on one randomized controlled trial and requires replication.

This drug is also widely used to treat migraines due to the effect it has on the blood vessels in the brain. It is used as a preventative for atypical migraine sufferers. It widens the blood vessels in the brain which become restricted by increased serotonin levels. It has been found to be increasingly effective for migraine sufferers with very few side effects.

==Adverse effects==
A [[GlaxoSmithKline]]-sponsored [[Phase IV trial|Phase IV]] study suggested that cognitive side effects may be more common with topiramate than with [[lamotrigine]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blum |first1=D |last2=Meador |first2=K |last3=Biton |first3=V |last4=Fakhoury |first4=T |last5=Shneker |first5=B |last6=Chung |first6=S |last7=Mills |first7=K |last8=Hammer |first8=A |last9=Isoj�rvi |first9=J |title=Cognitive effects of lamotrigine compared with topiramate in patients with epilepsy |journal=Neurology |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=400–6 |year=2006 |pmid=16894098 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000232737.72555.06}}</ref> In studies of healthy volunteers, therapeutic doses of topiramate for bipolar disorder produced greater cognitive deficits than lamotrigine, including short term memory loss and word-finding difficulty.

Side-effects reported by > 10% of subjects in at least one clinical study<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Roy Chengappa |first1=KN |last2=Schwarzman |first2=LK |last3=Hulihan |first3=JF |last4=Xiang |first4=J |last5=Rosenthal |first5=NR |author6=Clinical Affairs Product Support Study-168 Investigators |title=Adjunctive topiramate therapy in patients receiving a mood stabilizer for bipolar I disorder: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial |journal=The Journal of clinical psychiatry |volume=67 |issue=11 |pages=1698–706 |year=2006 |pmid=17196048 |doi=10.4088/JCP.v67n1105}}</ref>

* [[diarrhea]] (16.8%)
* [[nausea]] (15.4%)
* [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] (loss of appetite) (13.3%)
* [[memory problems]] (11.2%)

Side-effects most frequently leading to discontinuation of therapy with topiramate: 
* [[psychomotor retardation|psychomotor slowing]] (4.1%)
* memory problems (3.3%)
* [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] (3.3%)
* [[confusion]] (3.2%)
* [[somnolence]] (3.2%)

That same study also reported that in adult patients with Bipolar 1 disorder who were already receiving either [[lithium]] or [[valproate]], the addition of topiramate did not produce a statistically significant improvement versus placebo, while adding the above adverse reactions.  

Rarely, the inhibition of [[carbonic anhydrase]] may be strong enough to cause [[metabolic acidosis]] of clinical importance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mirza |first1=Nasir |last2=Marson |first2=Anthony G. |last3=Pirmohamed |first3=Munir |title=Effect of topiramate on acid-base balance: extent, mechanism and effects |journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=68 |pages=655–61 |year=2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2009.03521.x |issue=5 |pmid=19916989 |pmc=2791971}}</ref>

The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has notified prescribers that topiramate can cause acute [[myopia]] and secondary angle closure [[glaucoma]] in a small subset of people who take topiramate regularly.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/UCM173936.pdf</ref> The symptoms, which typically begin in the first month of use, include blurred vision and eye pain. Discontinuation of topiramate may halt the progression of the ocular damage, and may reverse the visual impairment.

Preliminary data suggests that, as with several other anti-epileptic drugs, topiramate carries an increased risk of congenital malformations.<ref name="pmid18645165">{{cite journal |last1=Hunt |first1=S |last2=Russell |first2=A |last3=Smithson |first3=WH |last4=Parsons |first4=L |last5=Robertson |first5=I |last6=Waddell |first6=R |last7=Irwin |first7=B |last8=Morrison |first8=PJ |last9=Morrow |first9=J |title=Topiramate in pregnancy: preliminary experience from the UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register |journal=Neurology |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=272–6 |year=2008 |pmid=18645165 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000318293.28278.33}}</ref> This might be particularly important for women who take topiramate to prevent migraine attacks. In March 2011 the FDA notified healthcare professionals and patients of an increased risk of development of [[cleft lip]] and/or [[cleft palate]] (oral clefts) in infants born to women treated with Topamax (topiramate) during pregnancy and placed it in [[Pregnancy category|Pregnancy Category]] D.<ref name="fda.gov">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm245085.htm</ref>

Topiramate has been associated with a [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] increase in [[suicide|suicidality]],<ref>http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/08/slides/2008-4344s1_09_01_Trileptal%20slides.pdf</ref> and "suicidal thoughts or actions" is now listed as one of the possible side effects of the drug "in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500." <ref name= "side-effects">"Topomax side effects": http://www.topamax.com/how-topamax-may-help--what-to-expect.html (retrieved Jan 6 2011)' "Migraine prevention medicine: Topomax": http://www.topamax.com/  (retrieved Jan 6 2011); NIH Pubmed Health, "Topiramate": http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000998/ (retrieved Jan 6 2011)</ref>

===Interactions===
Topiramate has many drug-drug interactions. Some of the most common are listed below:

* As topiramate inhibits [[carbonic anhydrase]], use with other inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase (e.g. [[acetazolamide]]) increases the risk of [[kidney stones]].
* [[Enzyme inducer]]s (e.g. [[carbamazepine]]) can increase the elimination of topiramate, possibly necessitating dose escalations of topiramate.
* Topiramate may increase the plasma-levels of phenytoin.
* Topiramate itself is a weak inhibitor of [[CYP2C19]] and induces [[CYP3A4]]; a decrease in plasma levels of estrogens and [[digoxin]] has been noted during topiramate therapy. This can reduce the effectiveness of [[combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]] (the pill); use of alternative birth control methods is recommended.<ref name=Martindale_OC>{{cite book|editor=Sweetman, Sean C. |chapter=Sex hormones and their modulators|title=[[Martindale: The complete drug reference]] |edition=36th |year=2009 |page=2068 |publisher=Pharmaceutical Press |location=London|isbn=978-0-85369-840-1}}</ref> Neither [[intrauterine device]]s (IUDs) nor [[Depo-Provera]] are affected by topiramate.<ref name=Martindale_OC/>
* Alcohol may cause increased sedation or drowsiness, and increase the risk of having a seizure.
* As listed in the 06/29/2005 label posted at the Drugs@FDA website page 14,'conditions or therapies that predispose to acidosis may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of Topiramate'.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2005/020505s018lbl.pdf FDA.gov]</ref>
* [[Anhidrosis|Oligohidrosis]] and hyperthermia were reported in post-marketing reports about topiramate; [[antimuscarinic]] drugs (like trospium) can aggravate these disorders.

===Overdose===
Overdose is rare. In most cases, acute exposure produced only minimal to moderate effects. Fatalities have occurred, but were the result of polydrug exposure.

Symptoms of overdose may include but are not limited to:<ref name="dailymed.nlm.nih.gov">http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=7412</ref>

* Agitation
* Depression
* Speech problems
* Blurred vision, double vision
* Troubled thinking
* Loss of coordination
* Inability to respond to things around you
* Loss of consciousness
* Confusion and coma
* Fainting
* Upset stomach and stomach pain
* Loss of appetite and vomiting
* Shortness of breath; fast, shallow breathing
* Pounding or irregular heartbeat
* Muscle weakness
* Bone pain
* Seizures

A specific antidote is not available. Treatment is entirely supportive.

===Detection in body fluids===
Blood, serum or plasma topiramate concentrations may be measured using immunoassay or chromatographic methods to monitor therapy, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation.

===Warnings===
People taking topiramate should be aware of the following risks: 
*Avoid activities requiring mental alertness and coordination until drug effects are realized.
*Topiramate may impair heat regulation,<ref name= "side-effects" /> especially in children. Use caution with activities leading to an increased core temperature, such as strenuous exercise, exposure to extreme heat, or dehydration.
*Topiramate may decrease effectiveness of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.
*Taking topiramate in the 1st trimester of pregnancy may increase risk of cleft lip/cleft palate in infant.<ref name="fda.gov"/>
*Topiramate should not be suddenly discontinued, as this may cause increased seizure activity.<ref name="rxlist.com"/>
*Avoid [[evening primrose]] (seizure threshold decreased) <ref>Lexi-Comp Online, Lexi-Drugs Online, Hudson, Ohio: Lexi-Comp, Inc.; 2011; February 18, 2011.</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Chemically, topiramate is a [[sulfamic acid|sulfamate]]-substituted [[monosaccharide]], related to [[fructose]], a rather unusual chemical structure for an anticonvulsant. 

Topiramate is quickly absorbed after oral use. Most of the drug (70%) is excreted in the urine unchanged. The remainder is extensively metabolized by [[hydroxylation]], [[hydrolysis]], and [[glucuronidation]]. Six [[metabolite]]s have been identified in humans, none of which constitutes more than 5% of an administered dose. 

The exact mechanism of action is unknown,<ref name="rxlist.com">http://www.rxlist.com/topamax-drug.htm</ref> but four properties that may contribute to topiramate's antiepileptic and antimigraine efficacy include a blockage of voltage-dependent sodium channels, an augmentation of gamma-aminobutyric acid activity at some subtypes of the GABA- A receptors, antagonism of AMPA/kainate subtype of the glutamate receptor, and inhibition of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme, particularly isozymes II and IV .

Its possible effect as a [[mood stabilizer]] seems to occur before anticonvulsant qualities at lower dosages. Topiramate inhibits maximal electroshock and [[pentylenetetrazol]]-induced seizures as well as partial and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the kindling model, findings predictive of a broad spectrum of activities clinically. Its action on [[mitochondrial permeability transition]] pores has been proposed as a mechanism.<ref name="pmid15571505">{{cite journal |last1=Kudin |first1=AP|last2=Debska-Vielhaber |first2=G |last3=Vielhaber |first3=S |last4=Elger |first4=CE |last5=Kunz |first5=WS |title=The mechanism of neuroprotection by topiramate in an animal model of epilepsy |journal=Epilepsia |volume=45 |issue=12 |pages=1478–87 |year=2004|pmid=15571505 |doi=10.1111/j.0013-9580.2004.13504.x}}</ref>

While many [[anticonvulsants]] have been associated with [[apoptosis]] in young animals, animal experiments have found that topiramate is the only anticonvulsant that does not induce apoptosis in young animals at doses needed to produce an anticonvulsant effect.<ref name="Czuczwar-2004">{{cite journal |last1=Czuczwar |first1=K |last2=Czuczwar |first2=M |last3=Cieszczyk |first3=J|last4=Gawlik |first4=P |last5=Luszczki |first5=JJ |last6=Borowicz |first6=KK |last7=Czuczwar |first7=SJ |title=Neuroprotective activity of antiepileptic drugs |journal=Przeglad lekarski |volume=61 |issue=11 |pages=1268–71 |year=2004 |pmid=15727029}}</ref>
