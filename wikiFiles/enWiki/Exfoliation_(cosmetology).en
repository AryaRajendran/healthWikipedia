'''Exfoliation''' involves the removal of the oldest dead [[skin]] cells on the skin's outermost surface, and has been used for many years to help maintain skin.  Exfoliation is involved in the process of all [[facial]]s, during [[microdermabrasion]] or [[chemical peels]] at medical spas. Exfoliation can be achieved through mechanical or chemical means.<ref>Joe Ball.

==History==
Credit is given to the ancient [[Egyptians]] for the practice of exfoliation.<ref name="Ray">Raymond T Kuwahara, MD. [http://www.emedicine.com/DERM/topic533.htm HISTORY OF CHEMOEXFOLIATION.] Retrieved on 2008-03-03.</ref> In the [[Middle Ages]], [[wine]] was used as a chemical exfoliant, with [[tartaric acid]] as the active agent.<ref name="Ray"/>  In [[Asia]], the practice of exfoliation started hundreds of years ago.<ref>Dr. Rock Positano. [https://www.nypost.com/seven/09182007/entertainment/health/getting_under_your_skin.htm Getting Under Your Skin.] Retrieved on 2008-03-03.</ref> The etymology of the word exfoliate comes from the Latin exfoliare (to strip off leaves).<ref>http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exfoliation</ref>

==Importance==
{{Main|Skin care}}
New skin cells are created in the skin's lower layer, the [[dermis]].  Over time, cells migrate to the surface of the skin and become more [[acidic]]. During their 30 day journey, they die and become saturated with [[keratin]].  Keratin is important because it protects the skin from outside elements.  Through the [[ageing]] process, and after [[menopause]] for women, the natural process of skin erosion becomes uneven, which gives skin a dry and rough character. Exfoliation removes the outer layer to reveal the newer skin beneath.  This shedding of the outer layer unclogs pores, keeps skin clean, and helps reduce acne outbreaks. Exfoliation should always be done after cleansing the skin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Exfoliation is important for men as it exposes the hair follicles, allowing a better shave. It is possible to over exfoliate, which dries and irritates the skin. The face is the part of the body most sensitive to exfoliation.<ref name="Anitra">Anitra Brown. [http://spas.about.com/od/spatreatmentbasics/a/exfoliation.htm What is Exfoliation?] Retrieved on 2008-03-03.</ref> Hence, provided that exfoliating causes the skin to dry out, it is very important to moisturize it, because dry skin can lead to [[wrinkle]] development{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}.

==Types==
Exfoliation is achieved through either mechanical or chemical means.

=== Mechanical ===
[[File:Exfoliation tools.jpeg|thumb|Exfoliation methods used in Canada in 2011.

This process involves physically scrubbing the skin with an [[abrasive]].<ref name="Anitra"/>  Mechanical exfoliants include [[microfiber]] cloths, adhesive exfoliation sheets, micro-bead facial scrubs, crepe paper, crushed [[apricot kernel]] or [[almond]] shells, [[sugar]] or [[bath salts|salt crystals]], [[pumice]], and abrasive materials such as [[sponge]]s, [[loofah]]s, [[brush]]es, and simply fingernails.<ref name="Muniz">Alex Muniz.

People with dry skin should avoid exfoliants which include a significant portion of [[pumice]], or crushed volcanic rock. Pumice is considered a good material to exfoliate the skin of the feet.<ref>Dr. John Gray. [http://www.pg.com/science/skincare/Skin_tws_106.htm The World of Skin Care.] Retrieved on 2008-03-03.</ref>{{dead link|date=February 2013}} [[Microdermabrasion]] is another mechanical method of exfoliation.

=== Chemical ===
Chemical exfoliants include scrubs containing [[salicylic acid]], [[glycolic acid]], [[fruit]] [[enzyme]]s, [[citric acid]], or [[malic acid]] which may be applied in high concentrations by a medical professional, or in lower concentrations in over-the-counter products. Chemical exfoliation may involve the use of products that contain [[alpha hydroxy acid]]s (AHAs), [[beta hydroxy acid]]s (BHAs), or enzymes that act to loosen the glue-like substance that holds the cells together, allowing them to ease away.<ref name="Anitra"/>  This type of exfoliation is recommended for people treating [[acne]].<ref>Wdxcyber.com. [http://www.wdxcyber.com/exfoliation.html Facial Skin Exfoliation.] Retrieved on 2008-03-03.</ref>  In beauty spa treatment on continental Europe, the chemical properties of wine producing grapes are exploited in the practice of [[vinotherapy]] which is becoming increasingly popular.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

=== With hair removal ===
Some methods of [[hair removal]] also exfoliate the skin.
*[[Waxing]] is a mechanical process which is done with the intention of plucking the hair, which also functions as a mechanical exfoliant. As this is done every two to eight weeks, it is not performed as frequently as many exfoliate, so it does not fully substitute for a regimen, but may substitute for a normal session in a regimen.
*[[Nair (hair removal)|Nair]] is an example of a [[Chemical depilatory|chemical hair removal]] product which also functions as a chemical exfoliant. It is done more frequently than waxing (once a week rather than once a month) since it only destroys hair partially below the skin, rather than destroying the entire root as with waxing. Using it weekly can substitute for a weekly exfoliant regime. It is a very aggressive chemical and cannot be used on the face so other exfoliants would need to be used on the face.
*[[Shaving|Wetshaving]] also has exfoliating properties; first, the action of moving a shaving brush vigorously across the face washes the face and removes dead skin at the same time. After applying the lather with a brush, the use of a double-edged safety razor or straight razor removes dead skin simply by the fact that the aforementioned razors are dragged much closer across the skin and remove dead skin more effectively than a cartridge or electric razor.

==Promotion==
In popular media, exfoliants are advertised as treatments which promote beauty, youthful appearance, or health.<ref name="Muniz"/>

==Disadvantages==
The greatest disadvantage to exfoliation is the high price of some of the products and methods used to achieve it.  Exfoliation will lead to some initial redness to the skin.  Near the end of chemical peels, the skin will frost, with colors varying from a bright white to grey on the skin surface.<ref name="Ray"/>
