'''Congenital hypothyroidism''' (CH) is a condition of [[thyroid]] [[hormone]] deficiency present at birth. Approximately 1 in 4000 newborn infants has a severe deficiency of thyroid function, while even more have mild or partial degrees. If untreated for several months after birth, severe congenital hypothyroidism can lead to [[growth failure]] and permanent [[mental retardation]]. Treatment consists of a daily dose of thyroid hormone ([[thyroxine]]) by mouth. Because the treatment is simple, effective, and inexpensive, nearly all of the developed world practices [[newborn screening]] to detect and treat congenital hypothyroidism in the first weeks of life.

==Etiology==
Around the world, the most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism is [[iodine]] deficiency, but in most of the developed world and areas of adequate environmental iodine, cases are due to a combination of known and unknown causes. Most commonly there is a defect of development of the thyroid gland itself, resulting in an absent (athyreosis) or underdeveloped (hypoplastic) gland. A hypoplastic gland may develop higher in the neck or even in the back of the tongue. A gland in the wrong place is referred to as ''ectopic'', and an ectopic gland at the base or back of the tongue is a ''lingual'' thyroid. Some of these cases of developmentally abnormal glands result from [[genetic disease|genetic defects]], and some are "sporadic," with no identifiable cause. One Japanese study found a statistical correlation between certain [[organochlorine]] [[insecticides]] and [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]]-like chemicals in the milk of mothers who had given birth to infants with congenital hypothyroidism.<ref name="pmid17307219">{{cite journal |author=Nagayama J, Kohno H, Kunisue T, ''et al.'' |title=Concentrations of organochlorine pollutants in mothers who gave birth to neonates with congenital hypothyroidism |journal=[[Chemosphere (journal)|Chemosphere]]|volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=972–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17307219 |doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2007.01.010 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0045-6535(07)00040-9}}</ref>

In some instances, hypothyroidism detected by screening may be transient. One common cause of this is the presence of maternal [[antibody|antibodies]] that temporarily impair thyroid function for several weeks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/Disease_Search.php?lng=EN&data_id=760&Disease_Disease_Search_diseaseGroup=congenital-hypothyroidism&Disease_Disease_Search_diseaseType=Pat&Disease(s)/group%20of%20diseases=Congenital-hypothyroidism&title=Congenital-hypothyroidism&search=Disease_Search_Simple |title=Congenital hypothyroidism |work=Orphanet |month=August |year=2010 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>

[[Cretinism]] is an old term for the state of mental and physical retardation resulting from untreated congenital hypothyroidism, usually due to [[iodine]] deficiency from birth because of low iodine levels in the soil and local food sources. The term, like so many other 19th century medical terms, acquired pejorative connotations as it became used in lay speech. It is now rarely used by physicians.

===Genetic===
Congenital hypothyroidism can also occur due to genetic defects of thyroxine or [[triiodothyronine]] synthesis within a structurally normal gland. Among specific defects are thyrotropin ([[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]]) resistance, iodine trapping defect, organification defect, [[thyroglobulin]], and [[iodotyrosine deiodinase]] deficiency. In a small proportion of cases of congenital hypothyroidism, the defect is due to a deficiency of [[thyroid stimulating hormone]], either isolated or as part of congenital [[hypopituitarism]].

Genetic types of nongoitrous congenital hypothyroidism include:

Nongoitrous congenital hypothyroidism has been described as the "most prevalent inborn endocrine disorder".<ref name="pmid16189712">{{cite journal |author=Grasberger H, Vaxillaire M, Pannain S, ''et al.'' |title=Identification of a locus for nongoitrous congenital hypothyroidism on chromosome 15q25.3-26.1 |journal=Hum.

==Diagnostic evaluation==
In the developed world, nearly all cases of congenital hypothyroidism are detected by the newborn screening program. These are based on measurement of TSH or thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) on the second or third day of life. If the TSH is high, or the T<sub>4</sub> low, the infant's doctor and parents are called and a referral to a [[pediatric endocrinology|pediatric endocrinologist]] is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and initiate treatment. Often a [[technetium]] (Tc-99m pertechnetate) [[thyroid scan]] is performed to detect a structurally abnormal gland.  A radioactive iodine (RAIU) exam will help differentiate congenital absence or a defect in organification (a process necessary to make thyroid hormone).

==Recent==
Researchers have discovered that the Fukushima nuclear disaster has had far-reaching health effects more drastic than previously thought: young children born on the US West Coast are 28 percent more likely to develop congenital hypothyroidism.

In examining post-Fukushima conditions along the West Coast, researchers found American-born children to be developing similar conditions that some Europeans acquired after the 1986 meltdown of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.

“Fukushima fallout appeared to affect all areas of the US, and was especially large in some, mostly in the western part of the nation,” researchers from the New York-based Radiation and Health Project wrote in a study published by the Open Journal of Pediatrics.

==Treatment==
The goal of newborn screening programs is to detect and start treatment within the first 1–2 weeks of life. Treatment consists of a daily dose of [[thyroxine]], available as a small tablet. The generic name is [[levothyroxine]], and several brands are available. Commonly used brands in North America are [[Synthroid]], [[Levoxyl]], [[Unithroid]], and [[Levothroid]]. The tablet is crushed and given to the infant with a small amount of water or milk. The most commonly recommended dose range is 10-15 [[microgram|μg]]/kg daily, typically 37.5 or 44 μg.<ref>{{cite journal |author=LaFranchi SH, Austin J |title=How should we be treating children with congenital hypothyroidism? |journal=[[J. Pediatr. Endocrinol. Metab.]] |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=559–78 |year=2007 |pmid=17642417 |doi= |url=}}</ref>
Within a few weeks, the T<sub>4</sub> and TSH levels are rechecked to confirm that they are being normalized by treatment. As the child grows up, these levels are checked regularly to maintain the right dose. The dose increases as the child grows.

==Symptoms==
Infants born with congenital hypothyroidism may show no effects, or may display mild effects that often go unrecognized as a problem: [[excessive sleeping]], reduced interest in [[breastfeeding|nursing]], [[poor muscle tone]], low or hoarse cry, infrequent bowel movements, exaggerated [[neonatal jaundice|jaundice]], and [[low body temperature]]. If fetal deficiency was severe because of complete absence (athyreosis) of the gland, physical features may include a larger anterior [[fontanel]], persistence of a posterior fontanel, an [[umbilical hernia]], and a large tongue ([[macroglossia]]). 

In the era before newborn screening, less than half of cases of severe hypothyroidism were recognized in the first month of life. As the months proceeded, these infants would grow poorly and be delayed in their development. By several years of age, they would display the recognizable facial and body features of cretinism. Persistence of severe, untreated hypothyroidism resulted in severe mental impairment, with an [[IQ]] below 80 in the majority. Most of these children eventually ended up in institutional care.

==Prognosis==
Most children born with congenital hypothyroidism and correctly treated with thyroxine grow and develop normally in all respects. Even most of those with athyreosis and undetectable T<sub>4</sub> levels at birth develop with normal intelligence, although as a population academic performance tends to be below that of siblings and mild learning problems occur in some.<ref name="pmid8062543">{{cite journal |author=Moltz KC, Postellon DC |title=Congenital hypothyroidism and mental development |journal=[[Compr Ther]] |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=342–6 |year=1994 |pmid=8062543 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Congenital hypothyroidism is the most common preventable cause of mental retardation. Few treatments in the practice of [[medicine]] provide as large a benefit for as small an effort.
