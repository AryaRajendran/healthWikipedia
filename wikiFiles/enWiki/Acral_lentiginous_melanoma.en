It is also found on mucous membranes. Unlike other forms of melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma does not appear to be linked to sun exposure.

It is the most common form of melanoma diagnosed amongst [[Asian people|Asian]] and [[Black people|Black]] ethnic groups.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The average age at diagnosis is between sixty and seventy years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} However, the melanoma can also occur in [[White people|Whites]] and in young people.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} <!--please elaborate on why caucasians and young people are specified here-->

== Diagnosis  ==

Even though the ideal method of diagnosis of melanomas should be complete [[Biopsy#Excisional_biopsy|excision]]al biopsy, the location of the melanoma may require alternatives.

[[Dermatoscopy]] of acral pigmented lesions is very difficult, but can be accomplished with diligent attention.

Initial confirmation of the suspicion can be done with a small wedge biopsy or small punch biopsy.  Thin deep wedge biopsies can heal very well on acral skin, and small punch biopsies can give enough clue to the malignant nature of the lesion.  Once this confirmatory biopsy is done, a second complete excisional [[skin biopsy]] can be performed with a narrow surgical margin (1&nbsp;mm).  This second biopsy will determine the depth and invasiveness of the [[melanoma]], and will help to define what the final treatment will be.  If the melanoma involves the nail fold and the nail bed, complete excision of the nail unit might be required.

Final treatment might require wider excision (margins of 0.5&nbsp;cm or more), digital amputation, lymphangiogram with lymph node dissection, or chemotherapy.

==Signs and Symptoms==
Typical signs of acral lentiginous melanoma include{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}:
* longitudinal tan, black, or brown streak on a finger or toe nail ([[melanonychia striata]])
* pigmentation of proximal nail fold
* areas of dark pigmentation on palms of hands or soles of feet

Warning signs are new areas of pigmentation, or existing pigmentation that shows change.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} If caught early, acral lentiginous melanoma has a similar cure rate as the other types of superficial spreading melanoma.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

There are often no symptoms for [[melanoma]] until it is well advanced.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Histology==
Histological signs of acral lentiginous melanoma include:
* atypical [[melanocyte]]s arranged singly and in [[junctional nest]]s
* [[dermal]] invasion
* [[desmoplasia]]

==Famous cases==
[[Bob Marley]]'s death was caused by acral lentiginous melanoma present under one of his toenails.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.bobmarley.com/story/?storypage=7|title=His story: The life and legacy of Bob Marley|publisher=web.bobmarley.com|accessdate=October 4, 2009}}</ref>
