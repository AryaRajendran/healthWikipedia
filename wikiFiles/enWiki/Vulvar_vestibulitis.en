'''Vulvar Vestibulitis Syndrome''' (VVS), '''vestibulodynia''', or simply '''vulvar vestibulitis''' is [[vulvodynia]] localized to the vulvar region. It tends to be associated with a highly localized “burning” or “cutting” type of pain. 

The pain of vulvodynia may extend into the clitoris; this is referred to as '''clitorodynia'''.

Vulvar Vestibulitis Syndrome (VVS) is the most common subtype of vulvodynia that affects premenopausal women - the syndrome has been cited as affecting about 10%–15% of women seeking gynecological care.<ref name=Bergeron97/>

== Symptoms ==

VVS is characterized by severe pain with attempted penetration of the [[vaginal orifice]] and complaints of tenderness with pressure within the [[vulval vestibule]]. Usually there are no reports of pain with pressure to other surrounding areas of the vulva. The feelings of irritation and burning can persist for hours or days following sexual activity, engendering a sense of hopelessness and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. VVS also can often cause [[dyspareunia]].

The pain may be provoked by contact with an object, such as with the insertion of a tampon or penis or with the pressure from sitting on a bicycle seat, ''provoked vestibulodynia'',<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/healthreport/treatment-of-sexual-difficulties-and-research-into-asexuality/4058034 Suggested treatment for sexual difficulties and research into asexuality, Dr Lori Brotto, 11 June 2012, ABC Radio National</ref> or it may be constant, as in the case of generalized vulvodynia. Some women have had pain since their first penetration (primary vulvar vestibulitis) while some have had it after a period of time with pain free penetration (secondary vulvar vestibulitis).<ref>http://www.ourgyn.com/content/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=66</ref>

Relationship problems often occur as the result of chronic frustration, disappointment, and depression associated with the condition.

== Diagnosis ==

Diagnosis is readily made by the cotton-swab test, in which pressure is applied in a circular fashion around the vulvar vestibule to assess complaints of pain. Laboratory tests are used to exclude bacterial or viral infection, and a careful examination of the vulvo/vaginal area is conducted to assess whether any atrophy is present.

== Causes ==

VVS involves multiple tiny [[erythema]]tous sores in the vulval vestibule.<ref name=pmid1659198/><ref>

It may be indicative of focal [[vaginitis]] - a number of causes may be involved, including [[sub-clinical]] human papillomavirus infection, chronic recurrent [[candidiasis]], or chronic recurrent bacterial [[vaginosis]].<ref name=pmid1659198/><ref name=Peckham86/> 
Muscular causes have been implicated as well, since chronic vulvar pain may be the result of chronic hypertonic perivaginal muscles, leading to vaginal tightening and subsequent pain. Some investigators have postulated the existence of neurological causes such as vestibular neural [[hyperplasia]]. Finally, psychological factors may contribute to or exacerbate the problem, since the anticipation of pain often results in a conditioned spasmodic reflex along with sexual desire and arousal problems.
