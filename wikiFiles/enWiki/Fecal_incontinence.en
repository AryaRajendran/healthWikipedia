'''Fecal incontinence''' ('''FI'''), also called '''faecal incontinence''', '''bowel incontinence''' or '''anal incontinence''', is a lack of control over [[defecation]], leading to involuntary loss of bowel contents—including [[flatus]], liquid stool elements and [[mucus]], or solid [[Human feces|feces]]. FI is a [[medical sign|sign]] or a [[medical symptom|symptom]], not a [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]. Incontinence can result from different causes and might occur with either [[constipation]] or [[diarrhea]]. Continence is maintained by several inter-related factors, and usually there is more than one deficiency of these mechanisms for incontinence to develop. The most common causes are thought to be immediate or delayed [[Childbirth#Maternal complications|damage from childbirth]], complications from prior [[Colorectal surgery#Surgical treatment and diagnostic procedures|anorectal surgery]] (especially involving the anal sphincters or hemorrhoidal vascular cushions) and altered bowel habits (e.g. caused by [[irritable bowel syndrome]],  [[Crohn's disease]], [[ulcerative colitis]], food intolerance, or constipation with overflow incontinence).<ref name="ASCRS core subjects FI" /> An estimated 2.2% of community dwelling adults are affected.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" />

Fecal incontinence has three main consequences:  local reactions of the perianal skin and urinary tract, including [[cutaneous condition#Secondary lesions|maceration]] (softening and whitening of skin due to continuous moisture), [[urinary tract infections]], or [[decubitus ulcers]] (pressure sores);<ref name="ASCRS core subjects FI" /> a financial expense for individuals (due to cost of medication and incontinence products, and loss of productivity), employers (days off), and [[Health insurance|medical insurers]] and society generally (health care costs, unemployment);<!--<ref name="ASCRS core subjects FI" /></blockquote> --> and an associated decrease in [[quality of life]].<ref name="Yamada textbook" /> There is often reduced self-esteem, shame, humiliation, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], a need to organize life around easy access to bathroom and avoidance of enjoyable activities.<!--<ref name="ASCRS core subjects FI" /></blockquote> --> FI is an example of a [[social stigma|stigmatized]] medical condition, which creates barriers to successful management. People may be too embarrassed to seek medical help, and attempt to self-manage the symptom in secrecy from others. 

FI is one of the most psychologically and socially debilitating conditions in an otherwise healthy individual, but it is generally treatable.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> Management can be achieved through an individualized mix of dietary, pharmacologic and surgical measures. Health care professionals are often poorly informed about treatment options,<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> and may fail to recognize the impact of FI.<ref name="Yamada textbook" />

==Definition==
There is no globally accepted definition,<ref name="ASCRS core subjects FI" /> but fecal incontinence is generally defined as the recurrent inability to voluntarily control the passage of bowel contents through the anal canal and expel it at a socially acceptable location and time, occurring in individuals over the age of four.<ref name="ASCRS core subjects FI">{{cite web|last=Kaiser|first=Andreas M|title=ASCRS core subjects: fecal incontinence|url=http://www.fascrs.org/physicians/education/core_subjects/2009/fecal_incontinence/|publisher=ASCRS|accessdate=29 October 2012}}</ref><ref name="ASCRS textbook">{{cite book|editors=Bruce G.

There is no consensus about the best way to classify FI,<ref name="NICE guidelines" /> and several methods are used.

Symptoms can be directly or indirectly related to the loss of bowel control. The direct (primary) symptom is a lack of control over bowel contents which tends to worsen without treatment. Indirect (secondary) symptoms, which are the result of leakage, include [[pruritus ani]] (an intense itching sensation from the anus), perianal [[dermatitis]] (irritation and inflammation of the skin around the anus), and urinary tract infections.<ref name="ASCRS core subjects FI" /> Due to embarrassment, people may only mention secondary symptoms rather than acknowledge incontinence. Any major underlying cause will produce additional signs and symptoms, such as protrusion of mucosa in external [[rectal prolapse]]. Symptoms of fecal leakage (FL) are similar, and may occur after defecation. There may be loss of small amounts of brown fluid and staining of the underwear.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" />

===Types===
FI can be divided into those people who experience a defecation urge before leakage (urge incontinence), and those who experience no sensation before leakage (passive incontinence or soiling).<ref name="NICE guidelines" /> Urge incontinence is characterized by a sudden need to defecate, with little time to reach a toilet. Urge and passive FI may be associated with weakness of the [[external anal sphincter]] (EAS) and [[internal anal sphincter]] (IAS) respectively.  Urgency may also be associated with reduced rectal volume, reduced ability of the rectal walls to distend and accommodate stool, and increased rectal sensitivity.<ref name="Yamada textbook" />

There is a continuous spectrum of different clinical presentations from incontinence of flatus (gas), through incontinence of mucus or liquid stool, to solids. The term ''anal incontinence'' often is used to describe flatus incontinence,<ref name="NICE guidelines" /> however it is also used as a synonym for FI generally. It may occur together with incontinence of liquids or solids, or it may present in isolation. Flatus incontinence may be the first sign of FI.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> Once continence to flatus is lost, it is rarely restored.<ref name="NICE guidelines" /> Anal incontinence may be equally disabling as the other types.<ref name="4th ICI">{{cite book|editors=Paul Abrams et al.|title=Incontinence : 4th International Consultation on Incontinence, Paris, July 5-8, 2008|year=2009|publisher=Health Publications|location=[Paris]|isbn=0-9546956-8-2|edition=4th ed.|page=35|chapter=Epidemiology of Urinary (UI) and Faecal (FI) Incontinence and Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP)|pmid=20025020|url=http://www.icsoffice.org/Publications/ICI_4/book.pdf}}</ref> Fecal leakage, fecal soiling and fecal seepage are minor degrees of FI, and describe incontinence of liquid stool, mucus, or very small amounts of solid stool. They cover a spectrum of increasing symptom severity (staining, soilage, seepage and accidents).<ref name="ASCRS core subjects FI" /> Rarely, minor FI in adults may be described as [[encopresis]]. Fecal leakage is a related topic to [[rectal discharge]], but this term does not necessarily imply any degree of incontinence. Discharge generally refers to conditions where there is [[pus]] or increased mucus production, or anatomical [[lesion]]s that prevent the anal canal from closing fully, whereas fecal leakage generally concerns disorders of IAS function and functional evacuation disorders which cause a solid fecal mass to be retained in the [[rectum]].<!-- <ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> --> Solid stool incontinence may be called complete (or major) incontinence, and anything less as partial (or minor) incontinence (i.e. incontinence of flatus (gas), liquid stool and/or mucus).<ref name="ASCRS textbook" />

In children over the age of four who have been toilet trained, a similar condition is generally termed encopresis (or soiling), which refers to the voluntary or involuntary loss of (usually soft or semi-liquid) stool.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaneshiro|first=Neil|title=Encopresis|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001570.htm|publisher=Medline Plus|accessdate=2 July 2012}}</ref> The term pseudoincontinence is used when there is FI in children who have anatomical defects (e.g. enlarged [[sigmoid colon]] or anal [[stenosis]]).<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> Encopresis is a term that is usually applied when there are no such anatomical defects present. The [[ICD-10]] classifies nonorganic encopresis under "behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence" and organic causes of encopresis along with FI.<ref>{{cite web|title=ICD-10 Classification of "Nonorganic encopresis"|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F98.1|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=4 February 2013}}</ref>  FI can also be classified according to gender, since the cause in females may be different to males, for example it may develop following radical [[prostatectomy]] in males,<ref name="Shamliyan 2009">{{cite journal|last=Shamliyan|first=TA|coauthors=Bliss, DZ; Du, J; Ping, R; Wilt, TJ; Kane, RL|title=Prevalence and risk factors of fecal incontinence in community-dwelling men.|journal=Reviews in gastroenterological disorders|date=2009 Fall|volume=9|issue=4|pages=E97-110|pmid=20065920}}</ref> whereas females may develop FI as an immediate or delayed consequence of damage whilst giving birth. [[Pelvic cavity|Pelvic anatomy]] is also different according to gender, with a wider [[pelvic outlet]] in females.

===Clinical measurement===
Several severity scales exist. The [[Cleveland Clinic]] (Wexner) fecal incontinence score takes into account five parameters that are scored on a scale from zero (absent) to four (daily) frequency of incontinence to gas, liquid, solid, of need to wear pad, and of lifestyle changes.<ref name="ASCRS core subjects FI" /> The Park's incontinence score uses four categories:
:1 - those continent for solid and liquid stool and also for flatus.
:2 - those continent for solid and liquid stool but incontinent for flatus (with or without urgency).
:3 - those continent for solid stool but incontinent for liquid stool or flatus.
:4 - those incontinent to formed stool (complete incontinence).<ref name=GB-Ratto>{{Google books|kYpjewpnvkIC|Fecal Incontinence: Diagnosis and Treatment|page=91}}</ref>
The fecal incontinence severity index is based on four types of leakage (gas, mucus, liquid stool, solid stool) and five frequencies (once to three times per month, once per week, tiwce per week, once per day, twice or more per day). Other severity scales include: AMS, Pescatori, Williams score, Kirwan, Miller score, Saint Mark's score and the Vaizey scale.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" />

==Differential diagnosis==
FI may present with signs similar to rectal discharge (e.g. fistulae, proctitis or rectal prolapse), pseudoincontinence, encopresis (with no organic cause) and irritable bowel syndrome.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" />

==Pathophysiology==
===Normal continence===
[[File:Stylized depiction of action of puborectalis sling.png|thumb|Stylized diagram showing action of the puborectalis sling, the looping of the puborectalis muscle around the bowel. This pulls the bowel forwards, and forms the anorectal angle, the angle between the anal canal and the rectum.

[[File:Gray1080.png|thumb|Structure of anal canal]]

{{See also|defecation}}
The mechanisms and factors contributing to normal continence are multiple and inter-related. The puborectalis sling, forming the anorectal angle (see diagram), is responsible for gross continence of solid stool.<ref name="Yamada textbook" /> The IAS is an involuntary muscle, contributing about 55% of the resting anal pressure. Together with the hemorrhoidal vascular cushions, the IAS maintains continence of flatus and liquid during rest. The EAS is a voluntary muscle, doubling the pressure in the anal canal during contraction, which is possible for a short time. The rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) is an involuntary IAS relaxation in response to rectal distension, allowing some rectal contents to descend into the anal canal where it is brought into contact with specialized sensory mucosa to detect consistency. The rectoanal excitatory reflex (RAER) is an initial, semi-voluntary contraction of the EAS and puborectalis which returns prevents incontinence following the RAIR. Other factors include the specialized anti-peristaltic function of the last part of the sigmoid colon, which keeps the rectum empty most of the time, sensation in the lining of the rectum and the anal canal to detect when there is stool present, its consistency and quantity, and the presence of normal rectoanal reflexes and defecation cycle which completely evacuates stool from the rectum and anal canal. Problems affecting any of these mechanisms and factors may be involved in the cause.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" />

===Causes===
FI is a sign or a symptom, not a diagnosis,<ref name="NICE guidelines" /> and represents an extensive list of causes. Usually, it is the result of a complex interplay of several coexisting factors, many of which may be simple to correct.<ref name="NICE guidelines"/> Up to 80% of people may have more than one abnormality that is contributing.<ref>{{cite book|editors= Paul Abrams et al.|title=Incontinence : 4th International Consultation on Incontinence, Paris, July 5-8, 2008|year=2009|publisher=Health Publications|location=[Paris]|isbn=0-9546956-8-2|edition=4th ed.|page=255|chapter=Pathophysiology of Urinary Incontinence, Faecal Incontinence and Pelvic Organ Prolapse}}</ref> Deficits of individual functional components of the continence mechanism can be partially compensated for a certain period of time, until the compensating components themselves fail. For example, [[obstetric]] injury may precede onset by decades, but [[menopause|postmenopausal]] changes in the tissue strength reduce in turn the competence of the compensatory mechanisms.<ref name="ASCRS core subjects FI" /><ref name="Coloproctology textbook" /> The most common factors in the development are thought to be obstetric injury and after effects of anorectal surgery, especially those involving the anal sphincters and hemorrhoidal vascular cushions.<ref name="ASCRS core subjects FI" /> The majority of incontinent persons over the age of 18 fall into one of several groups. These are: those with structural anorectal abnormalities (sphincter [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], sphincter degeneration, [[Anal fistula|perianal fistula]], rectal prolapse), [[neurological disorder]]s ([[multiple sclerosis]], [[spinal cord]] injury, [[spina bifida]], [[stroke]], etc.), constipation/[[fecal loading]] (presence of a large amount of feces in the rectum with stool of any consistency), cognitive and/or behavioral dysfunction ([[dementia]], [[learning disability|learning disabilies]]), diarrhea, [[inflammatory bowel disease]]s (e.g. ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease), irritable bowel syndrome, [[disability]] related (people who are frail, acutely unwell, or have [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]]/[[Acute (medicine)|acute]] disabilities), and those cases which are [[idiopathic]] (of unknown cause).<ref name="NICE guidelines">{{cite book|last=(UK)|first=National Collaborating Centre for Acute Care|title=Faecal incontinence the management of faecal incontinence in adults|year=2007|publisher=National Collaborating Centre for Acute Care (UK)|location=London|isbn=0-9549760-4-5|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK50665/}}</ref><ref name="Nusrat 2012">{{cite journal|last=Nusrat|first=S|coauthors=Gulick, E; Levinthal, D; Bielefeldt, K|title=Anorectal dysfunction in multiple sclerosis: a systematic review.|journal=ISRN neurology|year=2012|volume=2012|pages=376023|pmid=22900202|doi=10.5402/2012/376023|pmc=3414061}}</ref> [[Diabetes melitus]] is also known to be a cause, but the mechanism of this relationship is not well understood.<ref name="Rodrigues 2012">{{cite journal|last=Rodrigues|first=ML|coauthors=Motta, ME|title=Mechanisms and factors associated with gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with diabetes mellitus.|journal=Jornal de pediatria|date=2012 Jan-Feb|volume=88|issue=1|pages=17–24|pmid=22344626}}</ref>

====Congenital====
Anorectal anaomalies and spinal cord defects may be a cause in children. These are usually picked up and operated upon during early life, but continence is often imperfect thereafter.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" />

====Anal canal====
The functioning of the anal canal can be damaged, traumatically or atraumatically. The resting tone of the anal canal is not the only factor which is important, both the length of the high pressure zone and its radial translation of force are required for continence. This means that even with normal anal canal pressure, focal defects such as the keyhole deformity can be the cause of substantial symptoms. EAS dysfunction is associated with impaired voluntary control, whereas IAS dysfunction is associated with impaired fine tuning of fecal control.<ref name="ASCRS core subjects FI" /> Lesions which mechanically interfere with, or prevent the complete closure of the anal canal can cause a liquid stool or mucous rectal discharge. Such lesions include [[Hemorrhoid|piles]] (inflamed hemorrhoids), [[anal fissure]]s, [[anal cancer]] or fistulae. Obstetric injury may tear the anal sphincters, and some of these injuries may be occult (undetected). The risk of injury is greatest when labor has been especially difficult or prolonged, when [[Forceps in childbirth|forceps]] are used, with higher [[birth weight]]s or when an [[episiotomy]] is performed. Only when there is post operative investigation of FI such as [[endoanal ultrasound]] is the injury discovered.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> FI is a much under-reported complication of surgery. The IAS is easily damaged with an anal [[surgical retractor|retractor]] (especially the Park's anal retractor), leading to reduced resting pressure postoperatively. Since the hemorrhoidal vascular cushions contribute 15% of the resting anal tone, surgeries involving these structures may affect continence status.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> Partial internal [[sphincterotomy]], [[fistulotomy]], anal stretch (Lord's operation), [[hemorrhoidectomy]] or transanal advancement flaps may all lead to FI post operatively, with soiling being far more common than than solid FI. The "keyhole deformity" refers to scarring within the anal canal and is another cause of mucus leakage and minor incontinence. This defect is also described as a groove in the anal canal wall, and may occur after posterior midline [[fissurectomy]] or fistulotomy, or with lateral IAS defects. Rare causes of traumatic injury to the anal sphincters include military or traffic accidents complicated by [[pelvic fracture]]s, spine injuries or [[perineum|perineal]] [[lacerations]], insertion of [[foreign bodies]] in the rectum, and sexual abuse.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" />  Nontraumatic conditions causing anal sphincter weakness include [[scleroderma]], damage to the [[pudendal nerve]]s and IAS degeneration of unknown etiology.<ref name="Yamada textbook" /> Radiation induced FI may involve the anal canal as well as the rectum, when [[proctitis]], anal fistula formation and diminished function of internal and external sphincter occur.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> Irradiation may occur during [[radiotherapy]], e.g. for [[prostate cancer]].

====Pelvic floor====
Many people with FI have a generalized weakness of the pelvic floor, especially [[puborectalis]].<ref name="Yamada textbook" /> A weakened puborectalis leads to widening of the anorectal angle, and impaired barrier to stool in the rectum entering the anal canal, and this is associated with incontinence to solids. Abnormal descent of the pelvic floor can also be a sign of pelvic floor weakness. Abnormal descent manifests as [[descending perineum syndrome]] (>4&nbsp;cm perineal descent).<ref name="Yamada textbook" /> This syndrome initially gives constipation, and later FI. The pelvic floor is innervated by the pudendal nerve and the [[Sacral spinal nerve 3|S3]] and [[Sacral spinal nerve 4|S4]] branches of the [[pelvic plexus]]. With recurrent straining, e.g. during difficult labour or long term constipation, then stretch injury can damage the nerves supplying [[levator ani]]. The pudendal nerve is especially vulnerable to irreversible damage, (stretch induced pudendal [[neuropathy]]) which can occur with a 12% stretch.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> If the pelvic floor muscles loose their innervation, they cease to contract and their muscle fibres are in time replaced by fibrous tissue, which is associated with pelvic floor weakness and incontinence. Increased pudendal nerve terminal motor latency may indicate pelvic floor weakness. The various types of pelvic organ prolapse (e.g. external rectal prolapse, mucosal prolapse and internal rectal intussusception & solitary rectal ulcer syndrome) may also cause coexisting [[obstructed defecation]].

====Rectum====
The rectum needs to be of a sufficient volume to store stool until defecation. The rectal walls need to be "compliant" i.e. able to distend to an extent to accommodate stool. Rectal sensation is required to detect the presence, nature and amount of rectal contents. The rectum must also be able to evacuate its contents fully. There must also be efficient co-ordination of rectal sensation and relaxation of the anal canal.<ref name="hoffmann 1995">{{cite journal|last=Hoffmann|first=BA|coauthors=Timmcke, AE; Gathright JB, Jr; Hicks, TC; Opelka, FG; Beck, DE|title=Fecal seepage and soiling: a problem of rectal sensation.|journal=Diseases of the colon and rectum|date=1995 Jul|volume=38|issue=7|pages=746–8|pmid=7607037}}</ref> {{cn-span|Rectal storage capacity (i.e. rectal volume + rectal compliance) may be affected in the following ways. Surgery involving the rectum (e.g. [[lower anterior resection]], often performed for colorectal cancer), radiotherapy directed at the rectum, and inflammatory bowel disease can cause scarring, which may result in the walls of the rectum becoming stiff and inelastic, reducing compliance. Reduced rectal storage capacity may lead to urge incontinence, where there is an urgent need to defecate as soon as stool enters the rectum, where normally stool would be stored until there was enough to distend the rectal walls and initiate the defecation cycle. Tumors and strictures also may impair reservoir function. Conversely, increased rectal volume ([[megarectum]]), may cause fecal loading and overflow FI. Reduced rectal sensation may be a contributory factor.|date=February 2013}} If the sensory nerves are damaged, detection of stool in the rectum is dulled or absent, and the person will not feel the need to defecate until too late.

====Central nervous system====
Continence requires conscious and subconscious networking of information from and to the anorectum. Defects/brain damage may effect the [[central nervous system]] focally (e.g. stroke, tumor e.g. spinal cord lesions, trauma, multiple sclerosis) or diffusely (e.g. dementia, multiple sclerosis, infection, [[Parkinson's disease]] or drug-induced).<ref name="ASCRS core subjects FI" /><ref name="Salat-Foix 2012">{{cite journal|last=Salat-Foix|first=D|coauthors=Suchowersky, O|title=The management of gastrointestinal symptoms in Parkinson's disease.|journal=Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics|date=2012 Feb|volume=12|issue=2|pages=239–48|pmid=22288679|doi=10.1586/ern.11.192}}</ref> FI (and [[urinary incontinence]]) may also occur during [[epileptic seizures]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bromfield|first=EB|coauthors=Cavazos, JE; Sirven, JI|title=An Introduction to Epilepsy|year=2006|pmid=20821849|accessdate=30 January 2013}}</ref> [[Dural ectasia]] is an example of a spinal cord lesion that may affect continence.<ref name="Nallamshetty 2002">{{cite journal|last=Nallamshetty|first=L|coauthors=Ahn, NU; Ahn, UM; Nallamshetty, HS; Rose, PS; Buchowski, JM; Sponseller, PD|title=Dural ectasia and back pain: review of the literature and case report.|journal=Journal of spinal disorders & techniques|date=2002 Aug|volume=15|issue=4|pages=326–9|pmid=12177551}}</ref> <!-- Nb, listed uner reviews on pubmed, but not sure if it is primary or secondary... -->

====Diarrhea====
Liquid stool is more difficult to control than formed, solid stool. Hence, FI can be exacerbated by diarrhea.<ref name="NICE guidelines" /> Some consider diarrhea to be the most common aggravating factor.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> {{cn-span|Where diarrhea is caused by temporary problems such as mild infections or food reactions, incontinence tends to be short lived. Chronic conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome or [[Crohn's disease]], can cause severe diarrhea lasting for weeks or months. Diseases, drugs, and indigestible dietary fats that interfere with the [[intestine]]al absorption may cause [[steatorrhea]] (oily rectal discharge & fatty diarrhea) and degrees of FI. Respective examples include [[cystic fibrosis]], [[orlistat]], and [[olestra]]. [[Postcholecystectomy syndrome|Postcholecystectomy diarrhea]] is diarrhea that occurs following gall bladder removal, due to excess [[bile acid]].|date=March 2013}} Orlistat is an [[anti-obesity]] (weight loss) drug that blocks the absorption of fats.

====Overflow incontinence====
This may occur when there is a large mass of feces in the rectum (fecal loading), which may become hardened ([[fecal impaction]]). Liquid stool elements are able to pass around the obstruction, leading to incontinence. Megarectum (enlarged rectal volume) and rectal hyposensitivity are associated with overflow incontinence. Hospitalized patients and care home residents may develop FI via this mechanism,<ref name="NICE guidelines" /> possibly a result of lack of mobility, reduced alertness, constipating effect of medication and/or dehydration.

==Diagnostic approach==
Identification of the exact causes usually begins with a thorough [[medical history]], including detailed questioning about symptoms, bowel habits, diet, medication and other medical problems. [[Digital rectal examination]] is performed to assesses resting pressure and voluntary contraction (maximum squeeze) of the sphincter complex and puborectalis. Anal sphincter defects, rectal prolapse, and abnormal perineal descent may be detected.<ref name="Yamada textbook" /> {{cn-span|Anorectal physiology tests assess the functioning of the anorectal anatomy. [[Anorectal manometry]] records the pressure exerted by the anal sphincters and puborectalis during rest and during contraction. The procedure is also able to assess sensitivity of the anal canal and rectum. [[Anal electromyography]] tests for nerve damage, which is often associated with obstetric injury. Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency tests for damage to the pudendal motor nerves. Proctography, also known as [[defecography]], shows how much stool the rectum can hold, how well the rectum holds it, and how well the rectum can evacuate the stool. It will also highlight defects in the structure of the rectum such as [[internal rectal intussusception]]. Dynamic pelvic [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] is an alternative to traditional defecography. [[Proctosigmoidoscopy]] involves the insertion of an [[endoscope]] (a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera) into the anal canal, rectum and sigmoid colon. The procedure allows for visualization of the interior of the gut, and may detect signs of disease or other problems that could be a cause, such as inflammation, tumors, or scar tissue.|date=February 2013}} Endoanal ultrasound, which some consider to be the gold standard for detection of anal canal lesions,<ref name="Abdool 2012">{{cite journal|last=Abdool|first=Z|coauthors=Sultan, AH; Thakar, R|title=Ultrasound imaging of the anal sphincter complex: a review.|journal=The British journal of radiology|date=2012 Jul|volume=85|issue=1015|pages=865–75|pmid=22374273|doi=10.1259/bjr/27314678}}</ref> evaluates the structure of the anal sphincters, and may detect occult sphincter tears that otherwise would go unseen.

The diagnostic criteria are, one or more of the following factors present for the last 3 months: abnormal functioning of normally innervated and structurally intact muscles, minor abnormalities of sphincter structure/innervation (nerve supply), normal or disordered bowel habits, (i.e., fecal retention or diarrhea), and psychological causes. Furthermore, exclusion criteria are given. These are factors which all must be excluded for a diagnosis of functional FI, and are abnormal innervation caused by lesion(s) within the brain (e.g., dementia), spinal cord (at or below [[thoracic vertebra 12|T12]]), or [[sacral nerve]] roots, or mixed lesions (e.g., multiple sclerosis), or as part of a generalized peripheral or autonomic neuropathy (e.g., due to diabetes), anal sphincter abnormalities associated with a multisystem disease (e.g., scleroderma), and structural or neurogenic abnormalities that are the major cause.<ref name="Rome iii">{{cite web|title=Rome III  Diagnostic Criteria for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders|url=http://www.romecriteria.org/criteria/|publisher=Rome Foundation|accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref>

FI has an impact on virtually all aspects of peoples' lives, greatly diminishing physical and mental health, and affect personal, social and professional life. Emotional effects may include stress, tearfulness, anxiety, exhaustion, fear of public humiliation, feeling dirty, poor body-image, reduced desire for sex, anger, humiliation, depression, isolation, secrecy, frustration and embarrassment. Some people may need to be in control of life outside of FI as means of compensation. The physical symptoms such as skin soreness, pain and odor may also impact quality of life. Physical activity such as shopping or exercise is often affected. Travel may be affected, requiring careful planning. Working is also affected for most. Relationships, social activities and self-image likewise often suffer.<ref name="NICE guidelines" />

Symptoms may worsen over time,<ref name="ASCRS core subjects FI" /> but FI is generally treatable with conservative management, surgery or both.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" />  The success of treatment depends upon the exact causes and how easily these are corrected.<ref name="NICE guidelines" />  Treatment choice depends on the cause and severity of disease, and the motivation and general health of the person effected. Commonly, conservative measures are used together, and if appropriate surgery carried out. Treatments may be attempted until symptoms are satisfactorily controlled. A treatment algorithm based upon the cause has been proposed, including conservative, non-operative and surgical measures (neosphincter refers to either [[dynamic graciloplasty]] or artificial bowel sphincter, lavage refers to retrograde rectal irrigation).<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> Conservative measures include dietary modification, drug treatment, retrograde anal irrigation, biofeedback retraining anal sphincter exercises. Incontinence products refer to devices such as anal plugs and perineal pads and garments such as diapers/nappies. Perineal pads are efficient and acceptable for only minor incontinence.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> {{cn-span|If all other measures are ineffective [[colectomy|removing the entire colon]] may be an option.|date=March 2013}}

===Diet===
Dietary modification may be important for successful management.<ref name="Yamada textbook" /> Both diarrhea and constipation can contribute to different cases, so dietary advice must be tailored to address the underlying cause or it may be ineffective or counter productive. In persons with disease aggravated by diarrhea or those with rectal loading by soft stools, the following suggestions may be beneficial: increase [[dietary fiber]]; reduce [[wholegrain]] [[cereal]]s/[[bread]]; reduce fruit and vegetables which contain natural laxative compounds ([[rhubarb]], [[figs]], [[prunes]]/[[plums]]); limit [[bean]]s, [[pulses]], [[cabbage]] and [[Brussels sprout|sprout]]s; reduce [[spice]]s (especially [[chili pepper|chilli]]); reduce [[artificial sweeteners]] (e.g. sugar free [[chewing gum]]); reduce [[alcohol]] (especially [[stout]], [[beer]] and [[ale]]); reduce [[lactose]] if there is some degree of [[lactase deficiency]]; and reduce [[caffeine]]. Caffeine lowers the resting tone of the anal canal and also causes diarrhea. Excessive doses of [[vitamin C]], [[magnesium]], [[phosphorus]] and/or [[calcium]] supplements may increase FI. Reducing olestra fat substitute, which can cause diarrhea, may also help.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK50649/ Food/drink which may Exacerbate Faecal Incontinence in Patients who Present with Loose Stools or Rectal Loading of Soft Stool] 2007. National Collaborating Centre for Acute Care.</ref>

===Medication===
Pharmacological management may include anti-diarrheal/constipating agents and laxatives/stool bulking agents Stopping or substituting any previous medication that causes diarrhea may be helpful in some (see [[Fecal incontinence#Diarrhea|table]]). There may a benefit from constipating agents in those with coexisting diarrhea. There is little evidence regarding the relative efficacy of medications to other treatments or the use of medications in those with normal stool consitency.<ref name="Cheetham 2003">{{cite journal|last=Cheetham|first=M|coauthors=Brazzelli, M; Norton, C; Glazener, CM|title=Drug treatment for faecal incontinence in adults.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|year=2003|issue=3|pages=CD002116|pmid=12917921|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002116}}</ref> 

Anti-diarrheal/ constipating agents such as loperamide, [[codeine phosphate]] or [[diphenoxylate]] with [[atropine]] (co-phenotrope) may be used. Loperamide reduces stool weight, decreases bowel motility, rectoanal inhibitory reflex sensitivity and may slightly alter resting anal tone. Codeine phosphate and co-phenotrope are less commonly used because greater side effects.<ref name="Cheetham 2003" /> In people who have undergone [[cholecystectomy|gallbladder removal]], the [[bile acid sequestrant]] [[colestyramine]] may help minor degrees of FI.<ref>{{cite book|last=Romano|first=[edited by] Carlo Ratto, Giovanni B.

Ed.|page=313}}</ref> Laxatives may be used in elderly people where difficulties are secondary to constipation or fecal impaction (paradoxical diarrhea/ overflow incontinence). A common example is [[lactulose]]. Regular use of this laxative is intended to prevent recurrence of impaction. [[Laxative#bulk forming laxative|Stool bulking agents]] may reduce symptoms of obstructed defecation.<ref name="Cheetham 2003" /> Bulking agents also absorb water, so may be helpful those with diarrhea. A common side effect is [[bloating]] and [[flatulence]]. [[Topical medication|Topical agents]] to treat and prevent dermatitis may also be used, such as topical [[antifungal medication|antifungal]]s when there is evidence of perianal [[candidiasis]] or occasionally mild topical anti-inflammatory medication. Prevention of secondary lesions is carried out by perineal cleansing, [[moisturizer|moisturization]], and use of a skin protectant.<ref name="Gray 2012">{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=M|coauthors=Beeckman, D; Bliss, DZ; Fader, M; Logan, S; Junkin, J; Selekof, J; Doughty, D; Kurz, P|title=Incontinence-associated dermatitis: a comprehensive review and update.|journal=Journal of wound, ostomy, and continence nursing : official publication of The Wound, Ostomy and Continence Nurses Society / WOCN|date=2012 Jan-Feb|volume=39|issue=1|pages=61–74|pmid=22193141|doi=10.1097/WON.0b013e31823fe246}}</ref>

===Other measures===
Evacuation aids ([[suppositories]] or [[enemas]]) e.g. [[glycerine]] or [[bisacodyl]] suppositories may be prescribed. People may have poor resting tone of the anal canal, and consequently may not be able to retain an enema, in which case retrograde rectal irrigation may be a better option, as this equipment utilizes inflatable catheter to prevent loss of the irrigation tip and to provide a water tight seal as the irrigation is administered.<ref name="Cheetham 2003" /> Retrograde anal irrigation is where a volume of luke warm water is gently pumped into the colon via the anus. People can be taught how to perform this treatment in their own homes, but it does require special equipment. Complications such as [[electrolyte imbalance]] and [[bowel perforation|perforation]] are rare. Persistent leaking of residual irrigation fluid during the day may occur and make this option unhelpful. It has been suggested that if appropriate, people be offered home retrograde anal irrigation.<ref name="NICE guidelines" />

[[Biofeedback#Fecal incontinence and anismus|Biofeedback]] (the use equipment to record or amplify and then feed back activities of the body) is a commonly used and researched treatment, but the benefits are uncertain.<ref name="Norton 2012">{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=C|coauthors=Cody, JD|title=Biofeedback and/or sphincter exercises for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adults.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2012 Jul 11|volume=7|pages=CD002111|pmid=22786479|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3}}</ref> Biofeedback therapy varies in the way it is delivered, but it is unknown if one type has benefits over another.<ref name="Norton 2012" />

The role of [[pelvic floor exercise]]s and anal sphincter exercises in FI is poorly determined. While there may be some benefit they appear less useful than implanted sacral nerve stimulators.<!-- <ref name="Norton 2012" /> --> These exercises aim to increase the strength of the pelvic floor muscles (mainly levator ani). The anal sphincters are not technically part of the pelvic floor muscle group, but the EAS is a voluntary, striated muscle which therefore can be strengthened in a similar manner.<!-- <ref name="Norton 2012" /> --> It has not been established whether pelvic floor exercises can be distinguished from anal sphincter exercises in practice by the people doing them.<!-- <ref name="Norton 2012" /> --> This kind of exercise is more commonly used to treat urinary incontinence,<!-- <ref name="Norton 2012" /> --> for which there is a sound evidence base for effectiveness. More rarely are they used in FI. The effect of anal sphincter exercises are variously stated as an increase in the strength, speed or endurance of voluntary contraction (EAS).<ref name="Norton 2012" />

Electrical stimulation can also be applied to the anal sphincters and pelvic floor muscles, inducing muscle contraction without traditional exercises (similar to [[transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]], TENS). The evidence supporting its use is limited, and any benefit is tentative.<ref name="Hosker 2007"/> In light of the above, intra-anal electrical stimulation (using an anal probe as electrode) appears to be more efficacious than intra-vaginal (using a vaginal probe as electrode).<ref name="Hosker 2007">{{cite journal|last=Hosker|first=G|coauthors=Cody, JD; Norton, CC|title=Electrical stimulation for faecal incontinence in adults.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2007 Jul 18|issue=3|pages=CD001310|pmid=17636665|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001310.pub2}}</ref> Rarely, skin reactions may occur where the electrodes are placed, but these issues typically resolve when the stimulation is stopped. Surgically implanted [[sacral nerve stimulation]] may be more effective than exercises, and electrical stimulation and biofeedback may be more effective than exercises or electrical stimulation by themselves.<ref name="Norton 2012">{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=C|coauthors=Cody, JD|title=Biofeedback and/or sphincter exercises for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adults.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2012 Jul 11|volume=7|pages=CD002111|pmid=22786479|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3}}</ref>

===Surgery===
{{Main|Surgical management of fecal incontinence}}
Surgery may be carried out if conservative measures alone are not sufficient to control incontinence. There are many surgical options, and their relative effectiveness is debated due to a lack of good quality evidence. The optimal treatment regime may be a complex combination of various surgical and non-surgical therapies.<ref name="Brown 2010">{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=SR|coauthors=Wadhawan, H; Nelson, RL|title=Surgery for faecal incontinence in adults.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2010 Sep 8|issue=9|pages=CD001757|pmid=20824829|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001757.pub3}}</ref> The surgical options can be considered in four categories: restoration and improvement of residual sphincter function (sphincteroplasty, sacral nerve stimulation, correction of anorectal deformity), replacement / imitation of the sphincter or its function (anal encirclement, [[SECCA procedure]], non-dynamic graciloplasty, perianal injectable bulking agents), dynamic sphincter replacement (artificial bowel sphincter, dynamic graciloplasty), antegrade continence enema ([[Malone procedure]]), and finally fecal diversion (e.g. colostomy).<ref name="ASCRS core subjects FI" /> A surgical treatment algorithm has been proposed. Isolated sphincter defects (IAS/EAS) may be initially treated with sphincteroplasty and if this fails, the person can be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. Functional deficits of the EAS and/or IAS (i.e. where there is no structural defect, or only limited EAS structural defect, or with neurogenic incontinence) may be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. If this fails, neosphincter with either dynamic graciloplasty or artificial anal sphincter may be indicated. Substantial muscular and/or neural defects may be treated with neosphincter initially.<ref name="Coloproctology textbook" />

==Epidemiology==

FI is thought to be very common,<ref name="ASCRS core subjects FI" /> but much under-reported due to embarrassment. One study reported a prevalence of 2.2% in the general population.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> Risk factors include: age, female gender, urinary incontinence, history of vaginal delivery (non-[[Caesarean section]] childbirth), obesity,<ref name="4th ICI" /> prior anorectal surgery, poor general health and physical limitations. It affects people of all ages, but is more common in older adults (but it should not be considered a normal part of aging).<ref name="Shah 2012">{{cite journal|last=Shah|first=BJ|coauthors=Chokhavatia, S; Rose, S|title=Fecal Incontinence in the Elderly: FAQ.|journal=The American journal of gastroenterology|date=2012 Nov|volume=107|issue=11|pages=1635–46|pmid=22964553|doi=10.1038/ajg.2012.284}}</ref> Females are more likely to develop it than males (63% of those with FI over 30 may be female).<ref name="ASCRS core subjects FI" /> Combined urinary and fecal incontinence is sometimes termed double incontinence, and it is more likely to be present in those with urinary incontinence.<ref name="Lacima 2003">{{cite journal|last=Lacima|first=G|coauthors=Pera, M|title=Combined fecal and urinary incontinence: an update.|journal=Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology|date=2003 Oct|volume=15|issue=5|pages=405-10|pmid=14501244}}</ref> Some authors consider obstetric trauma to be the most common cause.<ref name="Rieger 1999">{{cite journal|last=Rieger|first=N|coauthors=Wattchow, D|title=The effect of vaginal delivery on anal function.|journal=The Australian and New Zealand journal of surgery|date=1999 Mar|volume=69|issue=3|pages=172–7|pmid=10075354}}</ref> Traditionally, FI was thought to be an insignificant complication of surgery, but it is now known that a variety of different procedures are associated with this possible complication, and sometimes at high levels.

==Society and culture==
Persons with this symptom are frequently ridiculed and ostracized in public. It has been described as one of the most psychologically and socially debilitating conditions in an otherwise healthy individual. In older people, it is one the most common reasons for admission into a care home. Persons who develop FI earlier in life are less likely to marry and obtain employment. Often, people will go to great lengths to keep their condition secret. It has been termed "the silent affliction" since many do not discuss the problem with their close family, employers or clinicians. They may be subject to gossip, hostility, and other forms of social exclusion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Norton|first=Nancy J.|title=Barriers on Diagnosis and Treatment; Impact of Fecal and Urinary Incontinence on Health Consumers – Barriers on Diagnosis and Treatment – A Patient Perspective|url=http://www.aboutincontinence.org/site/about-incontinence/daily-living-with-incontinence/barriers-on-diagnosis-and-treatment|publisher=International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (IFFGD)|accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ranganath|first=Sonia|title=Fecal Incontinence|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/268674-overview#a0199|publisher=WebMD LLC|accessdate=1 January 2013|coauthors=Tanaz R Ferzandi}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Bliss|first=DZ|coauthors=Norton, C|title=Conservative management of fecal incontinence.|journal=The American journal of nursing|date=2010 Sep|volume=110|issue=9|pages=30–8; quiz 39–40|doi=10.1097/01.NAJ.0000388262.72298.f5|pmid=20736708}}</ref> The economic cost has not received much attention.
