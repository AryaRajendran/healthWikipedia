'''Mucolipidosis''' ('''ML''') is a group of [[heredity|inherited]] [[metabolic disorder]]s that affect the body's ability to carry out the normal turnover of various materials within [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. 

When originally named, the mucolipidoses derived their name from the similarity in presentation to both [[mucopolysaccharidoses]] and [[sphingolipidoses]].<ref name="McMillanFeigin2006">{{cite book|author1=Julia A.

==ML II and III==
:''For details, see [[I-cell disease]]'' (type II) and [[Pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy]] (type III)

The other two types are closely related.

Mucolipidosis types II and III (ML II and ML III) result from a deficiency of the enzyme [[N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase]], which [[phosphorylate]]s target carbohydrate residues on N-linked [[glycoproteins]]. Without this phosphorylation, the glycoproteins are not destined for [[lysosomes]], and they escape outside the cell.

== Genetics ==

[[File:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Mucolipidosis has an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern of inheritance.]]

The mucolipidoses are inherited in an [[autosomal]] [[recessive]] manner, that is, they occur only when a child inherits two copies of the defective gene, one from each parent. When both parents carry a defective gene, each of their children faces a one in four chance of developing one of the MLs. At the same time, each child also faces a one in two chance of inheriting only one copy of the defective gene. People who have only one defective gene are known as carriers. These individuals do not develop the disease but they can pass the defective gene on to their own children. Because the defective genes involved in certain forms of ML are known, tests can identify people who are carriers in some instances.

== Diagnosis ==

The [[diagnosis]] of ML is based on clinical symptoms, a complete medical history, and certain [[laboratory]] tests.
