'''Granulomatous amoebic encephalitis''' ("GAE")<ref>{{cite pmid|19621290}}</ref> is a [[central nervous system]] disease caused by certain species,<ref name="urlAmebic Meningoencephalitis: Overview - eMedicine">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/996227-overview |title=Amebic Meningoencephalitis: Overview - eMedicine |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> especially species of ''[[Acanthamoeba]]'' and ''[[Balamuthia mandrillaris]]''.<ref>{{cite pmid|17932496}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|15358823}}</ref>

The term is most commonly used with ''Acanthamoeba''. In more modern references, the term "Balamuthia amoebic encephalitis" (BAE) is commonly used when ''Balamuthia mandrillaris'' is the cause.<ref>{{cite pmid|19657454}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|17644721}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|17913450}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|19236272}}</ref>

==Pathology==
GAE may present in numerous ways. There is no solid definition, as only a handful of patients have presented thus far with GAE. GAE can present with: [[paralysis|focal paralysis]], [[seizures]], [[brainstem]] symptoms, and other neurological problems, some of which may mimic [[glioma]] (especially brainstem glioma), or other brain diseases, which may hamper timely diagnosis. These symptoms are caused by inflammatory [[necrosis]] of brain tissue brought on by amoebic infiltrates.

==Appearance on Biopsy==
A [[brain biopsy]] will reveal the presence of infection by pathogenic amoebas. In GAE, these present as general inflammation and sparse [[granule (cell biology)|granule]]s. On microscopic examination, infiltrates of amoebic [[cysts]] and/or [[trophozoites]] will be visible.

==Treatment==
GAE, in general, must be treated by killing the pathogenic amoebas which cause it. 

===Acanthamoeba===
Even with treatment, the condition is often fatal, and there are very few recorded survivors, almost all of whom suffered permanent [[neurocognitive|neurocognitive deficits]]. Several drugs (including [[ketoconazole]], [[miconazole]], [[5-flucytosine]] and [[pentamidine]]) have been shown to be effective against GAE-causing organisms ''[[in vitro]]'' (in a lab petri dish, for example).<ref>[http://path.upmc.edu/cases/case156/dx.html Final Diagnosis - Case 156<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Balamuthia===
In one case, [[cloxacillin]], [[ceftriaxone]], and [[amphotericin B]] were tried.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Intalapaporn P, Suankratay C, Shuangshoti S, Phantumchinda K, Keelawat S, Wilde H |title=Balamuthia mandrillaris meningoencephalitis: the first case in southeast Asia |journal=Am.
