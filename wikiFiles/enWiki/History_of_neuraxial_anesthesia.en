In 1855, [[Friedrich Gaedcke]] (1828{{ndash}}1890) became the first to chemically isolate [[cocaine]], the most potent [[alkaloid]] of the [[coca]] plant. Gaedcke named the compound "erythroxyline".<ref name=Gaedcke1855>{{cite journal|last=Gaedcke|first=F|authorlink=Friedrich Gaedcke|title=Ueber das Erythroxylin, dargestellt aus den Blättern des in Südamerika cultivirten Strauches Erythroxylon Coca Lam|journal=Archiv der Pharmazie|volume=132|issue=2|pages=141–50|year=1855|doi=10.1002/ardp.18551320208|url=}}</ref><ref name=Zaunick1956>{{cite journal|last=Zaunick|first=R|title=Early history of cocaine isolation: Domitzer pharmacist Friedrich Gaedcke (1828–1890); contribution to Mecklenburg pharmaceutical history|journal=Beitr Gesch Pharm Ihrer Nachbargeb|volume=7|issue=2|pages=5–15|year=1956|pmid=13395966|url=}}</ref>

In 1884, Austrian [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] [[Karl Koller (ophthalmologist)|Karl Koller]] (1857{{ndash}}1944) instilled a 2% solution of cocaine into his own eye and tested its effectiveness as a local anesthetic by pricking the eye with needles.<ref name=Koller1884>{{cite journal|last=Koller|first=K|authorlink=Karl Koller (ophthalmologist)|title=Über die verwendung des kokains zur anästhesierung am auge|trans_title=On the use of cocaine for anesthesia on the eye|language=German|journal=Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift|volume=34|issue=|pages=1276–1309|year=1884|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=}}</ref> His findings were presented a few weeks later at annual conference of the Heidelberg Ophthalmological Society.<ref name=Karch2006>{{cite book|last=Karch|first=SB|title=A brief history of cocaine from Inca monarchs to Cali cartels : 500 years of cociane dealing|edition=2nd|chapter=Genies and furies|pages=51–68|publisher=Taylor & Francis Group|location=Boca Raton, Florida|year=2006|isbn=978-0849397752|url=http://books.google.com/?id=EL30bVA3orkC&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64&dq=%22Heidelberg+Ophthalmological+Society%22#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> The following year, [[William Stewart Halsted|William Halsted]] (1852{{ndash}}1922) performed the first brachial plexus block.<ref name=Halsted1885>{{cite journal|last=Halsted|first=WS|authorlink=William Stewart Halsted|title=Practical comments on the use and abuse of cocaine; suggested by its invariably successful employment in more than a thousand minor surgical operations|journal=New York Medical Journal|volume=42|issue=|pages=294–5|date=1885-09-12|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=}}</ref> Also in 1885, [[James Leonard Corning]] (1855{{ndash}}1923) [[Injection (medicine)|injected]] cocaine between the [[spinous process]]es of the lower [[lumbar vertebrae]], first in a dog and then in a healthy man.<ref name=Corning1885>{{cite journal|last=Corning|first=JL|authorlink=James Leonard Corning|title=Spinal anaesthesia and local medication of the cord|journal=New York Medical Journal|volume=42|issue=|pages=483–5|year=1885|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=}}</ref><ref name=Corning1888>{{cite journal|last=Corning|first=JL|title=A further contribution on local medication of the spinal cord, with cases|journal=New York Medical Record|volume=|issue=|pages=291–3|year=1888|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=}}</ref> His experiments are the first published descriptions of the principle of [[neuraxial blockade]].<ref name=Gorelick1987>{{cite journal|last=Gorelick|first=PB|last2=Zych|first2=D|title=James Leonard Corning and the early history of spinal puncture|journal=Neurology|volume=37|issue=4|pages=672–4|year=1987|pmid=3550521|pmc=|doi=10.1212/WNL.37.4.672|url=}}</ref>

On August 16, 1898, German surgeon [[August Bier]] (1861{{ndash}}1949) performed surgery under [[spinal anaesthesia|spinal anesthesia]] in [[Kiel]].<ref name=Bier1899>{{cite journal|last=Bier|first=A|authorlink=August Bier|title=Versuche uber cocainisirung des ruckenmarkes (Experiments on the cocainization of the spinal cord)|language=German|journal=Deutsche Zeitschrift fur Chirurgie|volume=51|issue=|pages=361–9|year=1899|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=}}</ref> Following the publication of Bier's experiments in 1899, a controversy developed about whether Bier or Corning performed the first successful spinal anesthetic.<ref name=Wulf1998>{{cite journal|last=Wulf|first=HFW|title=The centennial of spinal anesthesia|journal=Anesthesiology|volume=89|issue=2|pages=500–6|year=1998|doi=10.1097/00000542-199808000-00028|pmid=9710410|pmc=|url=http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=1998&issue=08000&article=00028&type=fulltext}}</ref><ref name=Marx1994>{{cite journal|last=Marx|first=GF|title=The first spinal anesthesia. Who deserves the laurels?|journal=Regional Anesthesia|volume=19|issue=6|pages=429–30|year=1994|pmid=7848956|pmc=|doi=|url=}}</ref>

There is no doubt that Corning's experiments preceded those of Bier. For many years however, a controversy centered around whether Corning's injection was a [[spinal anaesthesia|spinal]] or an [[epidural]] block. The dose of cocaine used by Corning was eight times higher than that used by Bier and [[Théodore Tuffier|Tuffier]]. Despite this much higher dose, the onset of [[analgesic|analgesia]] in Corning's human subject was slower and the [[Dermatome (anatomy)|dermatomal level]] of ablation of sensation was lower. Also, Corning did not describe seeing the flow of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] in his reports, whereas both Bier and Tuffier did make these observations. Based on Corning's own description of his experiments, it is apparent that his injections were made into the [[epidural space]], and not the [[subarachnoid space]].<ref name=Marx1994/> Finally, Corning was incorrect in his theory on the [[mechanism of action]] of cocaine on the [[spinal nerve]]s and [[spinal cord]]. He proposed&nbsp;– mistakenly&nbsp;– that the cocaine was absorbed into the [[vein|venous circulation]] and subsequently transported to the spinal cord.<ref name=Marx1994/>

Although Bier properly deserves credit for the introduction of spinal anesthesia into the clinical practice of medicine, it was Corning who created the experimental conditions that ultimately led to the development of both spinal and epidural anesthesia.<ref name=Marx1994/>

Romanian surgeon [[Nicolae Racoviceanu-Piteşti]] (1860–1942) was the first to use [[opioid]]s for intrathecal analgesia; he presented his experience in Paris in 1901.<ref name=Brill2003>{{cite journal|last=Brill|first=S|last2=Gurman|first2=GM|last3=Fisher|first3=A|title=A history of neuraxial administration of local analgesics and opioids|journal=European Journal of Anaesthesiology|volume=20|issue=9|pages=682–9|year=2003|issn=0265-0215|pmid=12974588|doi=10.1017/S026502150300111X|url=}}</ref><ref name=Diz2002/>

In 1921, Spanish military surgeon [[Fidel Pagés]] (1886{{ndash}}1923) developed the modern technique of lumbar epidural anesthesia,<ref name=Pages1921>{{cite journal|last=Pagés|first=F|authorlink=Fidel Pagés|title=Anestesia metamérica|language=Spanish|journal=Revista de Sanidad Militar|volume=11|issue=|pages=351–4|year=1921|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=}}</ref> which was popularized in the 1930s by Italian surgery professor [[Achille Mario Dogliotti]] (1897{{ndash}}1966).<ref name=Diz2002>J.

Beginning in October 1941, [[Robert Andrew Hingson]] (1913{{ndash}}1996), Waldo B. Edwards and James L. Southworth, working at the [[Marine Hospital Service|United States Marine Hospital]] at Stapleton, on Staten Island in New York, developed the technique of continuous caudal anesthesia.<ref name=Edwards1942>{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=WB|last2=Hingson|first2=RA|title=Continuous caudal anesthesia in obstetrics|journal=American Journal of Surgery|volume=57|issue=3|pages=459–64|year=1942|pmid=|pmc=|doi=10.1016/S0002-9610(42)90599-3|url=}}</ref><ref name=Hingson1942>{{cite journal|last=Hingson|first=RA|last2=Edwards|first2=WB|title=Continuous Caudal Anesthesia During Labor and Delivery|journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia|volume=21|issue=|pages=301–11|year=1942|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=}}</ref><ref name=Hingson1943>{{cite journal|last=Hingson|first=RA|last2=Edwards|first2=WB|title=Comprehensive review of continuous caudal analgesia for anesthetists|journal=Anesthesiology|volume=4|issue=2|pages=181–96|year=1943|pmid=|pmc=|doi=10.1097/00000542-194303000-00010|url=http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/Citation/1943/03000/Comprehensive_Review_of_Continuous_Caudal.10.aspx}}</ref><ref name=Rosenberg1999>{{cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=H|title=Robert Andrew Hingson, M.D.: OB analgesia pioneer (1913–1996)|journal=American Society of Anesthesiologists Newsletter|volume=63|issue=9|pages=12–13|year=1999|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=http://www.woodlibrarymuseum.org/Finding_Aid/hingson/hingson.pdf}}</ref> Hingson and Southworth first used this technique in an operation to remove the [[varicose veins]] of a Scottish merchant seaman. Rather than removing the caudal needle after the injection as was customary, the two surgeons experimented with a continuous caudal infusion of local anesthetic. Hingson then collaborated with Edwards, the chief [[obstetrics|obstetrician]] at the Marine Hospital, to study the use of continuous caudal anesthesia for analgesia during childbirth. Hingson and Edwards studied the caudal region to determine where a needle could be placed to deliver anesthetic agents safely to the spinal nerves without injecting them into the cerebrospinal fluid.<ref name=Hingson1943/>

The first use of continuous caudal anesthesia in a laboring woman was on January 6, 1942, when the wife of a [[United States Coast Guard]] sailor was brought into the Marine Hospital for an emergency Caesarean section. Because the woman suffered from rheumatic heart disease ([[heart failure]] following an episode of [[rheumatic fever]] during childhood), her doctors believed that she would not survive the stress of labor but they also felt that she would not tolerate general anesthesia due to her heart failure. With the use of continuous caudal anesthesia, the woman and her baby survived.<ref name=HingsonJAMA1943>{{cite journal|last=Hingson|first=RA|last2=Edwards|first2=WB|title=Continuous Caudal Analgesia in Obstetrics|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=121|issue=4|pages=225–9|year=1943|pmid=|pmc=|doi=10.1001/jama.1943.02840040001001|url=}}</ref>

The first described placement of a lumbar epidural catheter was performed by [[Pío Manuel María Martínez Curbelo]] (5 June 1906{{ndash}}1 May 1962) on January 13, 1947.<ref>[http://articulos.sld.cu/editorhome/archives/8890 Dr. Pío Manuel Martínez Curbelo (in Spanish)]</ref><ref>[http://www.sld.cu/galerias/pdf/sitios/anestesiologia/la_anestesia_epidural_continua.pdf LA ANESTESIA EPIDURAL CONTINUA POR VIA LUMBAR: ANTECEDENTES Y DESCUBRIMIENTO (in Spanish)]</ref> Curbelo, a Cuban anesthesiologist, introduced a 16 gauge Tuohy needle into the left flank of a 40 year-old woman with a large [[ovarian cyst]]. Through this needle, he introduced a 3.5 [[French catheter scale|French]] [[ureter]]al catheter made of elastic [[silk]] into the lumbar epidural space. He then removed the needle, leaving the catheter in place and repeatedly injected 0.5% percaine ([[cinchocaine]], also known as dibucaine) to achieve anesthesia. Curbelo presented his work on September 9, 1947, at the 22nd Joint Congress of the [[International Anesthesia Research Society]] and the International College of Anesthetists, in New York City.<ref name=Aldretee2004/><ref name=Curbelo1949>{{cite journal|last=Martinez Curbelo|first=M|title=Continuous peridural segmental anesthesia by means of a ureteral catheter|journal=Curr Res Anesth Analg|volume=28|issue=1|pages=13–23|year=1949|pmid=18105827|pmc=|doi=|url=}}</ref>
