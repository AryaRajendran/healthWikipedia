== Biography ==
Johnson was born on November 5, 1959 in Nigeria. Johnson attended King’s College in Lagos, Nigeria and received his diploma in 1975. He then went on to Davies’ College in Sussex, England followed by the Institute Catholique de Paris in Paris, France. Johnson graduated from the [[University of Glasgow]] in Scotland in 1982 with a Medicinae Baccalaureum et Chirurgie Baccalaureum degree, the equivalent of an M.D. He went on to train in psychiatry at the Royal London and Maudsley and [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bethlem Royal]] Hospitals, and to train in research at the Institute of Psychiatry ([[University of London]]). In 1991, Johnson graduated from the University of London with a Master of Philosophy degree in [[neuropsychiatry]]. Johnson conducted his doctoral research at [[Oxford University]] and obtained his Ph.D. equivalent in biomedical sciences from the University of Glasgow in 1993. Most recently, in 2004, Johnson earned his Doctor of Science degree in medicine from the University of Glasgow – the highest degree that can be granted in science by a British university.

Johnson joined the faculty at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston in 1993 and later became the Deputy Chairman for Research and Chief of the Division of Alcohol and Drug Addiction in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio in 1998. In 2001, Johnson received the Dan Anderson Research Award from the Hazelden Foundation for his “distinguished contribution as a researcher who has advanced the scientific knowledge of addiction recovery.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/addiction/thefilm/bios/6423_Bankole_Johnson.html|title=www.hbo.com/addiction/thefilm/bios/6423_Bankole_Johnson.html<!--INSERT TITLE-->}}</ref> In 2002, Johnson received the Distinguished Senior Scholar of Distinction Award from the [[National Medical Association]]. Johnson was inducted into the Texas Hall of Fame in 2003 for his contributions to science, mathematics, and technology.<ref>"Drs. Bankole Johnson, Wen-Hwa Lee join luminaries in Texas Hall of Fame". February 2003. http://www.uthscsa.edu/mission/article.asp?id=123</ref> On September 1, 2004, Johnson accepted an appointment to serve as Alumni Professor and Chairman of the Department of Psychiatric Medicine at the University of Virginia.<ref>"Dr. Bankole Johnson, new chairman of Psychiatric Medicine". 2004. http://www.virginia.edu/insideuva/2004/15/johnson_bankole.html</ref> Johnson became a fellow of the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] in 2007. In 2009 Johnson was named Associate Editor of the Editorial Board of ''The American Journal of Psychiatry'', and from 2010 to 2011 he served as Field Editor-in-Chief of ''Frontiers in Psychiatry''.

== Research ==
Johnson’s research focus is on the [[neuropsychopharmacology]] of addiction. His work integrates the neuroscience and behavioral aspects of addiction medicine with the goal of formulating a more thorough understanding of the basis of drug-seeking behavior and developing effective treatments. Central to his research is the role of and interaction between midbrain [[monoamine]] systems with a focus on [[serotonin]], [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA)/[[glutamate]] and [[dopamine]].

Johnson’s [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] (JAMA) paper, titled “Topiramate for treating alcohol dependence: a [[randomized controlled trial]]” and published in 2007, gained national and international media attention. The 14-week U.S. multi-site clinical trial involved 371 male and female alcoholics. Those patients taking topiramate had reduced heavy drinking and showed better results with lowering [[cholesterol]], body mass index, liver enzymes, and blood pressure than those taking the placebo.<ref>Johnson BA, Rosenthal N, Capece JA, et al. 2008. Improvement of physical health and quality of life of alcohol-dependent individuals with topiramate treatment: US multisite randomized controlled trial. Archives of Internal Medicine. 168: 1188-1199.</ref> The study results were featured on Reuters, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, CNN, Fox News, USA Today, the Associated Press, and many other media outlets.<ref>"A pill to cure alcoholism?

Johnson’s current research involves clinical trials and human laboratory studies, and includes [[neuroimaging]] and [[molecular genetics]]. He now incorporates neuroimaging evaluations into his drug interaction studies to identify the site-specific effects of abused drugs and to evaluate the effectiveness of potential medications for the treatment of addiction. Current studies include a clinical trial aimed at determining the effectiveness of ondansetron, a serotonin-3 antagonist, for the treatment of subtypes of alcoholics, as well as a human laboratory project trying to elucidate the effects of [[naltrexone]] and [[acamprosate]] on [[hepatic]] and [[renal]] function in alcohol-dependent individuals.
