::''"Adult child" redirects here because of the nature of a vulnerable adult to typically be, to whatever extent, a 'child in an adult's body'. For specific examples of [[cognitive impairment]]s that may present with similar end results, see [[learning disability]] and related articles.''

As defined in the [[psychology]], [[sociobiology]] and [[social work]] fields, a '''vulnerable adult''' is any person who lacks the absolute ''most basic'' (as distinct from mid-level or typical level) human [[life skills]] by reason of not having learned them through the [[formative years]] of [[childhood]], [[adolescence]] and [[young adult]]hood. A vulnerable adult is unable, rather than unwilling, to properly learn or properly maintain these skills, and is usually completely without, and unable to obtain, any family, friends, acquaintances or other assistive persons in their lives to offer education or assistance in these areas (see: [[abandonment]]). In order to be classed as vulnerable, the adult's circumstances must be unable to be altered or improved by the adult's own individual actions without assistance, and the adult must be shown to be a risk to him or her self if assistance is not provided. 

Finally, a vulnerable adult, if seen by a doctor for a long enough period of time, is usually given an official diagnosis of being a vulnerable adult so that a relevant [[social work]] department, housing authority, et cetera, if these exist in the relevant country, is/are able to enter the life of the vulnerable adult for assistive purposes. If the vulnerable adult has been abused, which is typically the case for long-term vulnerability, [[Trauma_counseling#The_post-trauma_self|trauma counselling]] and an [[assisted living]] facility may also be offered. Despite all this, some vulnerable adults are indeed [[homelessness|long-term homeless]].

A main cause of being a vulnerable adult is usually a clinical-level [[cognitive impairment]] such as [[Downs syndrome]] but can also be caused and/or exacerbated by other cognition issues and/or the [[Abuse#Effects_of_abuse_on_victims|long-term effects of abuse]] and severe neglect from an early age within a family structure. Some combination of abuse, severe neglect, and cognitive impairments, rather than any one of these things alone, is usually required for a vulnerable adult to become sufficiently vulnerable to be classed as a vulnerable adult.

A vulnerable adult's [[activities of daily living]] are usually impaired. Mild forms of such impairment include not knowing or being able to learn the skills necessary to communicate with a local government authority when help is needed (requiring an [[appropriate adult]] to step in to advocate on the vulnerable adult's behalf); not knowing how and not being able to learn to read or write complex documents when required such as letters from a [[court]] or a [[debt collector]] and thus avoiding them rather than seeking help to resolve them; not knowing how to navigate basic [[money management]] or [[personal finance]]; and so on. Severe forms of such impairment are myriad and are usually too complex to precisely define, but can include very severe [[learning disabilities]] together with cognitive impairments limiting the ability of the vulnerable adult to either give or receive [[human communication]] with another adult who does not have such impairments.

Vulnerable adults often are assigned to independent or semi-independent living situations inside [[assisted living]] facilities or even "community-supported living" [[council estate]]s, but depending on the resources of the country in question, and also the interpretation by a government authority of the precise degrees of vulnerability, the vulnerable adult is sometimes restricted to a 'residential home' (a quasi-hospital living environment) or is assigned long-term [[hospitalization]]. 

Problems sometimes arise as to the exact [[legal status]] of a vulnerable adult when there is a clear case of the vulnerable adult existing in a "[[grey area]]" between mild and severe overall impairment. Sometimes, even when in some ways severely impaired, a vulnerable adult may still be competent enough to not be regarded by the relevant authorities as sufficiently childlike for [[long-term care]]. [[Guardianship]] is also a problem when the vulnerable adult is completely without friends, family or acquaintances and legally-important matters (such as paperwork) must be properly filled out, but the vulnerable adult is unable to understand what the paperwork contains or why it is important. In the [[United Kingdom]], these situations are sometimes worsened by the [[Data Protection Act]] which prevents even some officials and/or [[appropriate adult]]s from accessing the vulnerable adult's complete personal information for assistive purposes. Some countries solve these issues by getting the vulnerable adult to sign [[power of attorney]] over to a relevant authority's representative, a [[solicitor]] providing the vulnerable adult free [[legal help]], or similar.
