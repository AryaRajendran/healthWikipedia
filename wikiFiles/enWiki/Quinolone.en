The majority of quinolones in clinical use belong to the subset '''fluoroquinolones''', which have a [[fluorine]] [[atom]] attached to the central ring system, typically at the 6-position or C-7 position.

==Medical uses==
Fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antibiotics that play an important role in treatment of serious bacterial infections, especially hospital-acquired infections and others in which resistance to older antibacterial classes is suspected.  Because the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics encourages the spread of multidrug resistant strains and the development of ''Clostridium difficile'' infections, treatment guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America, the American Thoracic Society, and other professional organizations recommend minimizing the use of fluoroquinolones and other broad-spectrum antibiotics in less severe infections and in those in which risk factors for multidrug resistance are not present.  

Fluoroquinolones are featured prominently in the [[The American Thoracic Society]] guidelines for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia.<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Guidelines for the management of adults with hospital-acquired, ventilator-associated, and healthcare-associated pneumonia |journal=Am.

Fluoroquinolones are often used for genitourinary infections, and are widely used in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections associated with urinary catheters.  In community-acquired infections, they are recommended only when risk factors for multidrug resistance are present or after other antibiotic regimens have failed. However, for serious acute cases of [[pyelonephritis]] or bacterial [[prostatitis]] where the patient may need to be hospitalised, fluoroquinolones are recommended as first-line therapy.<ref name="Liu-2005">{{Cite journal| last1 = Liu | first1 = H. | last2 = Mulholland | first2 = SG. | title = Appropriate antibiotic treatment of genitourinary infections in hospitalized patients | journal = Am J Med | volume = 118 Suppl 7A | pages = 14S–20S | month= July| year = 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjmed.2005.05.009 | pmid = 15993673| issue = 7 }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
[[File:GyraseCiproTop.png|thumb|Structure of bacterial DNA gyrase complexed with DNA and two ciprofloxacin molecules (green)]]
Fluoroquinolones inhibit the [[topoisomerase II]] ligase domain, leaving the two nuclease domains intact. This modification, coupled with the constant action of the [[topoisomerase II]] in the bacterial cell, leads to DNA fragmentation via the nucleasic activity of the intact enzyme domains.

Fluoroquinolones can enter cells easily via [[porin (protein)|porins]] and, therefore, are often used to treat [[intracellular]] [[pathogen]]s such as ''[[Legionella pneumophila]]'' and ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]''. For many [[Gram-negative bacteria]], DNA gyrase is the target, whereas topoisomerase IV is the target for many [[Gram-positive bacteria]].

Fluoroquinolones have been recommended to be reserved for the use in patients who are seriously ill and may soon require immediate hospitalization.<ref>Jim Hoover, for Bayer Corporation, Alaska Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee 19 March 2004</ref> Though considered to be very important and necessary drugs required to treat severe and life-threatening bacterial infections, the associated antibiotic misuse remains unchecked, which has contributed to the problem of bacterial resistance. The [[overuse of antibiotic]]s such as happens with children suffering from otitis media (ear infections) has given rise to a breed of super bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics entirely.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Froom J, Culpepper L, Jacobs M, ''et al.'' |title=Antimicrobials for acute otitis media?

Fluoroquinolones had become the most commonly prescribed class of antibiotics to adults in 2002. Nearly half (42%) of these prescriptions were for conditions not approved by the FDA, such as [[acute bronchitis]], [[otitis media]], and acute upper respiratory tract infection, according to a study supported in part by the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]].<ref name="Lind"/><ref>K08 HS14563 and HS11313</ref> In addition, they are commonly prescribed for medical conditions, such as acute respiratory illness, that are usually caused by viral infections.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=12588273 |quote= From 1995 to 2002, inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections, which are usually caused by viruses and thus are not responsive to antibiotics, declined from 61 to 49 percent. However, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as the fluoroquinolones, jumped from 41 to 77 percent from 1995 to 2001. Overuse of these antibiotics will eventually render them useless for treating antibiotic-resistant infections, for which broad-spectrum antibiotics are supposed to be reserved. |url=http://www.ahrq.gov/research/nov07/1107RA29.htm |year=2003 |last1=Neuhauser |first1=MM |last2=Weinstein |first2=RA |last3=Rydman |first3=R |last4=Danziger |first4=LH |last5=Karam |first5=G |last6=Quinn |first6=JP |title=Antibiotic resistance among gram-negative bacilli in US intensive care units: implications for fluoroquinolone use |volume=289 |issue=7 |pages=885–8 |journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association |doi=10.1001/jama.289.7.885}}</ref>

Within a recent study concerning the proper use of this class in the emergency rooms of two academic hospitals, 99% of these prescriptions were revealed to be in error. Out of the 100 total patients studied, 81 received a fluoroquinolone for an inappropriate indication. Out of these cases, 43 (53%) were judged to be inappropriate because another agent was considered first line, 27 (33%) because there was no evidence of a bacterial infection to begin with (based on the documented evaluation), and 11 (14%) because of the need for such therapy was questionable. Of the 19 patients who received a fluoroquinolone for an appropriate indication, only one patient of 100 received both the correct dose and duration of therapy.<ref name="pmid12622607">{{Cite journal|author=Lautenbach E, Larosa LA, Kasbekar N, Peng HP, Maniglia RJ, Fishman NO |title=Fluoroquinolone utilization in the emergency departments of academic medical centers: prevalence of, and risk factors for, inappropriate use |journal=Arch.

==History==
Nalidixic acid is considered to be the predecessor of all members of the quinolone family, including the second, third and fourth generations commonly known as fluoroquinolones. This first generation also included other quinolone drugs, such as [[pipemidic acid]], [[oxolinic acid]], and [[cinoxacin]], which were introduced in the 1970s. They proved to be only marginal improvements over nalidixic acid.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Norris |first1=S |last2=Mandell |first2=GL |title=The quinolones: history and overview |year=1988 |publisher=Academic Press Inc |location=San Diego |pages=1–22 |chapter=The quinolones: history and overview}}</ref> Though it is generally accepted nalidixic acid is to be considered the first quinolone drug, this has been disputed over the years by a few researchers who believe [[chloroquine]], from which nalidixic acid is derived, is to be considered the first quinolone drug, rather than nalidixic acid.

Since the introduction of nalidixic acid in 1962, more than 10,000 [[structural analog|analogs]] have been synthesized, but only a handful have found their way into clinical practice.

==Legal status==

===Current litigation===
A significant number of cases are pending before the United States District Court, District of Minnesota, involving the drug Levaquin. On 13 June 2008, a Judicial Panel On Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) granted the Plaintiffs’ motion to centralize individual and class-action lawsuits involving Levaquin in the District of Minnesota over objection of Defendants, Johnson and Johnson / Ortho McNeil.<ref name="mnd.uscourts.gov"/> 

On 6 July 2009, the New Jersey Supreme Court had also designated litigation over Levaquin as a mass tort and has assigned it to an Atlantic County, N.J., judge.

Several class action lawsuits had been filed in regards to the adverse reactions allegedly suffered by those exposed to ciprofloxacin during the anthrax scare of 2001.

===Boxed warnings===
In the US, the package insert for fluoroquinolone antibiotics includes a "Black Box" warning of increased risk of developing [[tendonitis]] and tendon rupture in patients of all ages taking fluoroquinolones for systemic use. This risk is further increased in individuals over 60 years of age, taking [[corticosteroid]] drugs, and have received kidney, heart, or lung transplants.

In 2011, the FDA has added another boxed warning that says fluoroquinolones, due to their neuromuscular blocking activity, may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with [[myasthenia gravis]]. Serious adverse events, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been reported in this group of patients. Avoidance of fluoroquinolones in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis is advised.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/ucm247115.htm Risk of fluoroquinolone-associated Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation February 2011 Label Changes for Fluoroquinolones] FDA, online access 16 March 2011</ref>

The only universal standard applied is the grouping of the non[[fluorine|fluorinated]] drugs found within this class (quinolones) within the 'first-generation' heading. As such, a wide variation exists within the literature dependent upon the methods employed by the authors.
