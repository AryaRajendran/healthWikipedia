Doctors and the media debated whether the donor and/or the recipient had attempted suicide, with reports stating that the donor had hanged herself.<ref name=People/> The family of the donor told the funeral director who handled the donor's death that the donor had an accidental death. Local French newspapers stated that Dinoire's daughter said that the mother attempted to commit suicide. Dubernard said that the recipient did not try to kill herself.

==Partial face transplant==
The first partial [[face transplant]] surgery on a living human was performed on Dinoire on 27 November 2005 by Professor [[Bernard Devauchelle]], assisted by Professor [[Jean-Michel Dubernard]] at the Centre hospitalier Universitaire Nord in [[Amiens]], [[France]]. A triangle of face tissue, including the nose and mouth, was taken from a [[brain-dead]] female donor and grafted onto the patient.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Woman has first face transplant|newspaper=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4484728.stm|date=30 November 2005|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051202050329/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4484728.stm|archivedate=2 December 2005|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=French woman receives world's first face transplant: surgeon|newspaper=Breitbart.com|url=http://www.breitbart.com/news/2005/11/30/051130163131.b6enuyf7.html|date=30 November 2005|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051202021017/http://www.breitbart.com/news/2005/11/30/051130163131.b6enuyf7.html|archivedate=2 December 2005|deadurl=yes}}</ref>  "Scientists elsewhere have performed [[scalp]] and [[ear]] transplants.

==Recovery==
Whether the challenging surgery will be proven successful in the long run is yet to be seen. As of 2009, Dinoire's doctors report she is recovering well.<ref>"7 face transplants have been done worldwide." ''[[Associated Press]]''. 10 April 2009.

Retrieved on 11 April 2009.</ref> Exactly one year following the partial face transplant, Dinoire stated she had the ability to smile again. On 28 November 2006, Dinoire's surgeon, [[Bernard Devauchelle]], said that over the past year Dinoire’s scars had become far less prominent.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6190612.stm BBC article, 2006]</ref>

There has been a change in her appearance. Her original face had a wide, tilted nose, a prominent chin and thin lips. The donated face has given her a straight and narrow nose, a smaller chin and a fuller mouth. In 2008, Dinoire admitted in an interview that she sometimes struggles to accept the appearance of her transplanted face, as she had expected it to look more like her own, saying: "It takes an awful lot of time to get used to someone else's face." In the same interview, she reported that full sensitivity had returned to her face.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/3367041/Face-transplant-woman-struggles-with-identity.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Face transplant woman struggles with identity | first=Peter | last=Allen | date=2 November 2008 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref>

The [[Associated Press]] released a picture of Dinoire on 28 November 2006, one year after the operation. The French newspaper ''Le Monde'''s website explained on 2 December 2006 that the Associated Press had eliminated the picture, because "The hair of Isabelle Dinoire and the background of this image were manipulated by the source."

For the two-year anniversary, her doctors published an article in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' detailing her operation and recovery. Complications have included [[kidney failure]] and two episodes of tissue rejection (one after one month and one after one year),<ref name="face hand transplant"/> which have been suppressed by drugs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Dinoire will have to take the drugs for the rest of her life.
