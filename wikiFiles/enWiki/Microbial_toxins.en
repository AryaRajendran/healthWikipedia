'''Microbial toxins''' are [[toxin]]s produced by micro-organisms, including bacteria<!-- not mentioned in article , viruses--> and fungi. Microbial toxins promote infection and disease by directly damaging host tissues and by disabling the immune system. Some bacterial toxins, such as ''[[Botulinum]]'' neurotoxins, are the most potent natural toxins known. However, microbial toxins also have important uses in medical science and research. Potential applications of toxin research include combating microbial virulence, the development of novel anticancer drugs and other medicines, and the use of toxins as tools in [[neurobiology]] and [[cellular biology]].<ref name= ProftT>{{cite book |author= Proft T (editor)| year=2009 |title=Microbial Toxins: Current Research and Future Trends | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-44-8}}</ref>

==Bacterial toxin==
Bacteria generate toxins<ref>{{DorlandsDict|eight/000109722|bacterial toxins}}</ref> which can be classified as either [[exotoxin]]s or [[endotoxin]]s. Exotoxins are generated and actively secreted; endotoxins remain part of the bacteria. Usually, an endotoxin is part of the [[bacterial outer membrane]], and it is not released until the bacterium is killed by the [[immune system]]. The body's response to an endotoxin can involve severe [[inflammation]]. In general, the inflammation process is usually considered beneficial to the infected host, but if the reaction is severe enough, it can lead to [[sepsis]].

Some bacterial toxins can be used in the treatment of [[tumor]]s.<ref name="urlDefinition of bacterial toxin - NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms">{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=45610 |title=Definition of bacterial toxin - NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-12-13}}</ref>

'''Toxinosis''' is pathogenesis caused by the bacterial toxin alone, not necessarily involving [[bacterial infection]] (e.g. when the bacteria have died, but have already produced toxin, which are ingested). It can be caused by ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' toxins, for example.<ref name=Microbiology348> Page 348 in: {{cite book |author=Fisher, Bruce; Harvey, Richard P.; Champe, Pamela C. |title=Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews: Microbiology (Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year= |pages= |isbn=0-7817-8215-5 |oclc= |doi=}} </ref>

==''Botulinum'' neurotoxin==
''Botulinum'' neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the causative agents of the deadly food poisoning disease, botulism, and could pose a major biological warfare threat due to their extreme toxicity and ease of production. They also serve as powerful tools to treat an ever expanding list of medical conditions.<ref name= KukrejaR>{{cite book |author= Kukreja R and Singh BR|year=2009|chapter=Botulinum Neurotoxins: Structure and Mechanism of Action|title=Microbial Toxins: Current Research and Future Trends|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-44-8}}</ref>

==Tetanus toxin==
''[[Clostridium tetani]]'' produces tetanus toxin (TeNT protein), which leads to a fatal condition known as [[tetanus]] in many vertebrates (including humans) and invertebrates.

==Staphylococcal toxins==
Immune evasion proteins from ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' have a significant conservation of protein structures and a range of activities that are all directed at the two key elements of host immunity, complement and neutrophils. These secreted virulence factors assist the bacterium in surviving immune response mechanisms.<ref name= Langley>{{cite book |author= Langley et al.|year=2009|chapter=Staphylococcal Immune Evasion Toxins|title=Microbial Toxins: Current Research and Future Trends|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-44-8}}</ref>
