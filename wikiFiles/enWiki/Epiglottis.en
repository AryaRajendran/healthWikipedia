The '''epiglottis''' is a flap that is made of [[elastic cartilage]] tissue covered with a [[mucous membrane]], attached to the entrance of the [[larynx]]. It projects obliquely upwards behind the tongue and the hyoid bone, pointing dorsally. The term, like ''[[tonsil]]s'', is often incorrectly used to refer to the [[uvula]].<ref>[http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/45548,features,someones-been-careless-with-my-eplglottis ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>  There are [[taste bud]]s on the epiglottis.<ref>Jowett, Shrestha, 1998.

==Anatomy and function==

The epiglottis guards the entrance of the [[glottis]], the opening between the [[vocal folds]].
It is normally pointed upward while one is [[breathing]] with its underside functioning as part of the [[Human pharynx|pharynx]], but while one is [[swallowing]], elevation of the [[hyoid bone]] draws the [[larynx]] upward; as a result, the epiglottis folds down to a more horizontal position, with its superior side functioning as part of the pharynx. In this manner it prevents food from going into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and instead directs it to the [[esophagus]], which is posterior.

The epiglottis is one of nine cartilaginous structures that make up the larynx (voice box). While one is breathing, it lies completely within the pharynx. When one is swallowing it serves as part of the anterior of the larynx.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In some languages, the epiglottis is used to produce speech sounds, though this sound-type is rather rare.  Further information can be found under [[epiglottal consonant]].

==Histology==
===Appearance===

In a direct section of the epiglottis it can be seen that the body consists of [[elastic cartilage]]. The epiglottis has two surfaces, a lingual and a laryngeal surface, related to the [[oral cavity]] and the [[larynx]] respectively.

===Mucosa===

The entire lingual surface and the apical portion of the laryngeal surface (since it is vulnerable to abrasion due to its relation to the digestive tract) are covered by stratified [[squamous]] non-keratinized epithelium. The rest of the laryngeal surface on the other hand, which is in relation to the respiratory system, has respiratory epithelium: pseudostratified, ciliated [[columnar cells]] and [[mucus]] secreting [[Goblet cells]].

==Clinical significance==
===Reflexes===

The [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (CN IX) sends fibers to the upper epiglottis that contribute to the [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] limb of the [[gag reflex]]. The superior laryngeal branch of the [[vagus nerve]] (CN X) sends fibers to the lower epiglottis that contribute to the efferent limb of the [[cough reflex]].<ref>April, Ernest. Clinical Anatomy, 3rd ed. Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins.</ref>

===Infection of the epiglottis===

In children, the epiglottis will occasionally become infected with ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' and ''[[Streptococci]]'' in the trachea, causing massive inflammation, called "[[Epiglottitis]]". This condition has become rare in countries where [[vaccination]] against ''Haemophilus influenzae'' (Hib) is administered.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
