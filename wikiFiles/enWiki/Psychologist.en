A '''psychologist''' evaluates, diagnoses, treats, and studies behavior and mental processes.<ref name=r1>U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Outlook Handbook: [http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos056.htm Psychologists]</ref>  Some psychologists, such as clinical and counseling psychologists, provide mental health care, and some psychologists, such as social or organizational psychologists conduct research, usually in university or other academic settings.  Psychologists are often confused with psychiatrists: A psychologist has a graduate degree (usually a PhD or PsyD), whereas a psychiatrist has an MD (or, by continuing their study, a PHD).

There are many different types of psychologists, as is reflected by the 56 different divisions of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA).<ref>[http://www.apa.org/about/division/index.aspx Divisions of the APA]</ref> Psychologists are generally described as being either "applied" or "research-oriented".  The common terms used to describe this central division in psychology are "scientists" or "scholars" (those who conduct research) and "practitioners" or "professionals" (those who apply psychological knowledge). The training models endorsed by the APA require that applied psychologists be trained as both researchers and practitioners,<ref>See: [[Scientist–practitioner model]] and [[Practitioner-scholar model]]</ref> and that they possess advanced degrees.

Most typically, people encounter psychologists and think of the discipline as involving the work of [[Clinical psychology|clinical psychologists]] or [[Counseling psychology| counselling psychologists]].  While [[counseling]] and [[psychotherapy]] are common activities for psychologists,  these applied fields are just one branch in the larger domain of psychology.<ref>[http://everydaypsychology.com/2006/10/what-is-psychology.html What is Psychology?] at everydaypsychology.com</ref>  Research and teaching comprise a major role among psychologists. Technological advances in the future may increase the usage of computerized testing and assessment services in order to do some of the jobs of psychologists, including recognizing mental disorders.<ref> Wiggins, J. G. (1994, June). Would you want your child to be a psychologist? American Psychologist, 49(6), 485-492. {{doi|10.1037/0003-066X.49.6.485}} </ref>

==Licensing and regulation==

===Australia===

In Australia the psychology profession and the use of the title 'psychologist' is regulated by an Act of Parliament, Health Practitioner Regulation (Administrative Arrangements) National Law Act 2008[http://www.ahpra.gov.au/], following an agreement between the state and territory governments. Under the national law, registration of psychologists is administered by the Psychology Board of Australia (PsyBA).<ref>[http://www.psychologyboard.gov.au/ Psychology Board of Australia]. Psychologyboard.gov.au. Retrieved on 2011-11-22.</ref> Before July 2010, professional registration of psychologists was governed by various State and Territory Psychology Registration Board.<ref>[http://www.psychreg.health.nsw.gov.au/ NSW Psychologist's Registration Board]</ref> The [[Australian Psychology Accreditation Council]] (APAC) oversees education standards for the profession of psychology.

The minimum requirements for general registration in psychology and to use the title 'psychologist' is an APAC approved four year degree sequence in psychology followed by either: (1) a two year masters program or (2) two years supervised by a registered psychologist.[http://www.apac.psychology.org.au/]. Endorsement within a specific area of practice (e.g. [[Counseling psychology|Counselling]], [[Clinical psychology|Clinical]], [[Clinical neuropsychology|Neuropsychological]], [[Organisational psychology|Organisational]], [[Forensic psychology|Forensic]], or [[Educational Psychology]]) requires additional qualification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologyboard.gov.au/Endorsement.aspx |title=Psychology Board of Australia - Endorsement |publisher=Psychologyboard.gov.au |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref> These notations are not 'specialist' titles (Western Australian psychologists may use 'specialist' in their titles during a three year transitional period).<ref>[http://www.psychologyboard.gov.au/documents/default.aspx?record=WD10%2f3764&dbid=AP&chksum=zRjgqyUmQ4luixdLF8nTCA%3d%3d Transition provisions for Western Australia psychologists Fact Sheet]</ref>

Membership with [[Australian Psychological Society]] (APS) differs from registration as a psychologist. The standard route to full membership (MAPS) of the APS technically requires a masters or doctoral degree in psychology in an accredited course. An alternate route is available for academics and practitioners who have gained appropriate experience and made substantial contribution to the field of psychology. Association membership requires four years of APAC accredited undergraduate study.

Restrictions apply to all who want to use the title 'psychologist' in any form in all states and territories of Australia. However, the terms 'psychotherapist', 'social worker', and 'counselor' are currently self-regulated with several organizations campaigning for government regulation.<ref>e.g. [[Australian Counseling Association]] and [[Psychotherapy and Counseling Federation of Australia]]</ref>

===Belgium===
In Belgium, the title "psychologist" is protected by law since 1993. It can only be used by people who are included as such on the list of a national government commission. The minimum requirement is a completed five years university training in psychology (Master's degree or equivalent). The title of "psychotherapist" is not legally protected (yet).

===Finland===
In [[Finland]], the title "psychologist" is protected by law. Restriction is governed by [[National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health (Finland)]]. It takes 330 ECTS-credits (about six years) to accomplish the studies.

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], the use of the title 'Diplom-Psychologe' is restricted by law, and a practitioner is legally required to hold the corresponding academic title, which is comparable to a higher MSc degree and requires up to five years of training.  With the current reforms, this degree will be replaced by a lower master's degree and a new Ph.D. [[doctoral degree|degree]] in [[psychology]].
The academic degree of Diplom-Psychologe does not include a psychotherapeutical qualification, which requires three to five years of additional training.  The psychotherapeutical  training combines in-depth theoretical knowledge with supervised patient care and self-reflection units. After having completed the training requirements, psychologists take a state-run exam, which, upon successful completion, confers the official title of 'psychological psychotherapist' (psychologischer Psychotherapeut). {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Greece===
In Greece, the title "psychologist" has been protected by law since 1979. It can only be used by people who hold a relevant licence to practice as a psychologist. The minimum requirement is the completion of university training in psychology at a Greek university, or at a university recognized by the Greek authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seps.gr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=204:announcement&catid=69:2011&Itemid=298 |title=Ανακοίνωση του Διοικητικού Συμβουλίου του Συλλόγου Ελλήνων Ψυχολόγων |publisher=Seps.gr |date=2011-04-19 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref>

===The Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, the title of "psychologist" is not restricted by law. The Dutch professional association of psychologists (NIP), using trademark law, therefore posited its own title "Psychologist NIP" (Psycholoog NIP), which is granted exclusively to holders of a Masters degree in psychology, after a year of postgraduate experience.
The titles "psychotherapist" (psychotherapeut) and "healthcare psychologist" (gz-psycholoog / gezondheidszorgpsycholoog) are restricted through the Individual Healthcare Professions Act (wet BIG) to those who have followed further postgraduate (PsyD/DPsych or Licentiate level) training. The use of the titles "clinical psychologist" (klinisch psycholoog) and clinical neuropsychologist (klinisch neuropsycholoog) is reserved for those who have followed specialist post-licentiate training.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the use of the title "psychologist" is restricted by law. Prior to 2004, only the title "Registered Psychologist" was restricted (to people qualified and registered as such). However with the proclamation of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003, the use of the title "Psychologist" was limited to practitioners registered with the New Zealand Psychologists Board. (The titles "Clinical Psychologist", "Counselling Psychologist", "Educational Psychologist", "Intern Psychologist", and "Trainee Psychologist" are similarly protected.) This is to protect the public by providing assurance that the title user is registered and therefore qualified, competent, and can be held accountable for their practice. The legislation does not currently include an exemption clause for any class of practitioner (e.g., academics, or government employees). <New Zealand Psychologists Board>

===South Africa===
In [[South Africa]],<ref> Sourced from the Departments of Psychology: [http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/psychology/ University of Cape Town], [http://www.wits.ac.za/umthombo/psychology/7311/home.html University of the Witwatersrand], [http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&ContentID=14025 University of South Africa] </ref> psychologists are qualified in one of Clinical-, Counselling-, Educational-, Organisational- or Research Psychology.  To attain the qualification, one must complete a recognised [[Masters degree]] in Psychology and an appropriate [[practicum]] at a recognised training institution, and also sit an examination set by the Professional Board for Psychology.<ref>[http://www.hpcsa.co.za/board_psychology.php Professional Board for Psychology]. HPCSA. Retrieved on 2011-11-22.</ref> Registration with the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA)<ref>[http://www.hpcsa.co.za/ HPCSA]. HPCSA. Retrieved on 2011-11-22.</ref> is required, and includes a [[Continuing Professional Development]] component. The practicum usually involves a full year [[internship]], and in some specializations the HPCSA requires completion of an additional year of [[community service]]. The Master's comprises [[seminar]]- and [[coursework]]-based theoretical and practical [[training]], and a [[dissertation]] of limited scope, and is (in most cases) two years in duration.  Prior to enrolling for the Master’s, the student will have studied psychology for three years as an undergraduate ([[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] or [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]], and, for Organisational Psychology, also [[Bachelor of Commerce|B.Com.]]), followed by an additional [[postgraduate]] [[Bachelor's degree#South Africa|honours degree]] in psychology; see [[List of universities in South Africa]]. Qualification thus requires at least five years of study, and at least one of internship.

===Sweden===
In Sweden the titles "psychologist" and "practiced psychologist" are restricted in law. It can only be used after receiving a license from the government. The basic requirements are a completed five years specialised course in psychology (equivalent of a Master's degree) and 12 months of practice under supervision. All other uses are banned, though often challenged.
"Psychotherapist" follows similar rules but the basic educational demands are another 1.5 years (spread out over three years) at a specialised course in psychotherapy (that do vary a lot concerning theoretical footing), in addition to an academical level degree within a field concerning the treatment of people (psychologist, social worker, psychiatrist a.s.o.). Others than psychologist usually have to complete their education with basic courses in psychotherapy to meet the demands for the applied psychotherapy classes.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK the following titles are restricted by law: "registered psychologist" and "[[practitioner psychologist]]"; in addition the following specialist titles are restricted by law: "clinical psychologist", "counselling psychologist", "educational psychologist", "forensic psychologist", "health psychologist", "occupational psychologist" and "sport and exercise psychologist".<ref>[http://www.hpc-uk.org/apply/psychologists/ HPC – Health Professions Council – Becoming registered as a practitioner psychologist]. Hpc-uk.org. Retrieved on 2011-11-22.</ref> The Health Professions Council  [[health professions council|(HPC-UK)]] is the statutory regulator for practitioner psychologists in the UK. In the UK the use of the title "chartered psychologist" is also protected by statutory regulation.  The title "chartered psychologist" simply means that the psychologist is a chartered member of the [[British Psychological Society]] but it does not necessarily signify the psychologist is registered with the HPC-UK. It is an offense for someone who is not in the appropriate section of the HPC-UK Register to provide clinical psychology services, counselling psychology services, educational psychology services, forensic psychology services, health psychology services, occupational psychology services or sport and exercise psychology services.<ref>[http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/protectedtitles/ HPC – Health Professions Council – Protected titles]. Hpc-uk.org. Retrieved on 2011-11-22.</ref> The threshold level of qualification for entry to the Register for clinical, counselling and educational psychologists is a professional doctorate (and in the case of the latter two the British Psychological Society's Professional Qualification which meets the standards of a professional doctorate).<ref>[http://www.hpc-uk.org/mediaandevents/news/index.asp?id=253 HPC – Health Professions Council – News]. Hpc-uk.org (2009-06-11). Retrieved on 2011-11-22.</ref> The title ‘psychologist’ is not protected on its own.<ref name="hpc-uk.org">[http://web.archive.org/web/20090403121258/http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/aspirantgroups/psychologists/ Practitioner psychologists]</ref> Also the title of "neuropsychologist" is not protected at present.<ref name="hpc-uk.org"/> The British Psychological Society is working with the HPC-UK to ensure that the title of "neuropsychologist" is regulated as a specialist title for practitioner psychologists; one of the options could be the use of post-doctoral level registers.

===United States and Canada===

Full membership with the [[American Psychological Association]] in United States and Canada requires doctoral training (except in some provinces like Alberta where a master's degree is sufficient). Associate membership requires at least two years of postgraduate studies in psychology or approved related discipline. The minimal requirement for full membership can be waived in certain circumstances where there is evidence that significant contribution or performance in the field of psychology has been made.<ref>[http://www.apa.org/about/division/officers/handbook/membership.aspx APA Membership information]. Apa.org. Retrieved on 2011-11-22.</ref>

A professional in the U.S. or [[Canada]] must hold a doctorate in psychology (PsyD ot PhD) to use the title, "psychologist". To practice clinically, they must also hold a clinical license to practice as a psychologist. <ref>"Currently, '''all''' (State) jurisdictions have laws that limit the use of the term psychologist to those who are licensed or who are specifically exempt, as in an exempt setting." (Reference: [http://www.siop.org/tip/jan09/17silzer.aspx  American Psychological Association ('''APA''') Division 14,  Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology ('''SIOP''')])</ref> The exception to this is the profession of a school psychologist who can be certified by boards of education to practice and use the title "psychologist" with an Education Specialist (Ed.S) degree.  The most commonly recognized psychology professionals are clinical and counseling psychologists,  those who provide [[psychotherapy]] and/or administer and interpret psychological tests. There are state-by-state differences in requirements for academics in psychology and government employees.

Psychologists in the United States have campaigned for legislation changes to enable specially trained psychologists to prescribe psychiatric medicine. New legislation in Louisiana and New Mexico has granted those who take an additional masters program in psychopharmacology permission to prescribe medications for mental and emotional disorders in co-ordination with the patient's physician. Louisiana was the second state to provide such legislation.<ref name="louisianapsychologist.org">[http://www.louisianapsychologist.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&subarticlenbr=6 Louisiana Psychological Association]. Louisianapsychologist.org. Retrieved on 2011-11-22.</ref> This legislation has not come without considerable controversy.  As of 2009, Louisiana is the only of the United States where the licensing and regulation of the practice of psychology by medical psychologists who prescribe medications is regulated by those in medicine (i.e., Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners).  While other states have pursued prescriptive privileges, they have yet to be successful. Similar legislation in the states of [[Hawaii]] and [[Oregon]] passed through the legislative House and Senate but it was vetoed by the Governor.<ref name="louisianapsychologist.org"/>

==Employment==
{{Globalize/USA|date=December 2010}}
In the United States the vast majority of 170,200 psychologist jobs, 152,000 are employed in clinical, counseling, and school positions, 2300 are employed in industrial-organizational, and 15,900 in "all-other" positions. Opportunities are very limited for Bachelor degree and Masters degrees holders, and they will face intense competition in the job market.<ref name=r1/>

In the United Kingdom as of the end of December 2012 there were 19,000 practitioner psychologists registered,<ref>http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/professions/index.asp?id=14#profDetails</ref> across 7 categories: [[clinical psychologist]], [[Counselling psychology|counselling psychologist]], [[educational psychologist]], [[forensic psychologist]], [[Health Psychology|health psychologist]], [[Occupational psychology|occupational psychologist]], [[sport and exercise psychologist]]. At least 9500 of these are clinical psychologists,<ref>http://dcp.bps.org.uk/</ref> which is the largest psychology group within clinical settings such as the NHS. Around 2000 are educational psychologists.<ref>http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/12356/1/epwg%20research%20report.pdf</ref>

==Salaries==
In the U.S., The median salary for 2010 for clinical, counseling, and school psychologists was US$66,810 and the median salary for organizational psychologists was US$77,010.<ref name=r1/><ref>[http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes193031.htm Clinical, Counseling, and School Psychologists].

==Contrast with psychiatrist==
{{Main|Psychiatrist}}
{{See also|Clinical psychology}}

Although [[Clinical psychology|clinical psychologists]] and [[psychiatrist]]s can be said to share a same fundamental aim—the alleviation of mental distress—their training, outlook, and methodologies are often quite different. Perhaps the most significant difference is that [[psychiatrists]] are [[licensed physicians]]. As such, psychiatrists often use the [[medical model]] to assess mental health problems and rely on [[psychoactive drug|psychotropic medications]] as the chief method of addressing mental health problems<ref>{{cite journal|author=Graybar, S. and Leonard, L. |year=2005|journal=American Journal of Psychotherapy|volume=59|issue=1|pages= 1–19}}</ref>—although many also employ [[psychotherapy]] as well. Psychologists receive extensive training in psychological test administration, scoring, interpretation and reporting.  Examples include the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory II (MMPI-II), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test IV (WAIS-IV), and the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory III (MCMI-III).  These tests, along with others, help to inform diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.  For example, in a medical center, a patient with a complicated clinical presentation who is being seen by a psychiatrist might be referred to a clinical psychologist for psychological testing to aid in diagnosis and treatment.  In addition, psychologists (particularly those from PhD programs) spend several years in graduate school being trained to conduct behavioral research, including research design and advanced statistical analysis.  While this training is available for physicians via dual MD/PhD programs, it is not typically included in medical education.

Psychologists generally do not [[medical prescription|prescribe]] medication, although there is a growing movement for clinical psychologists to have limited [[prescriptive authority for psychologists movement|prescribing privileges]]. Clinical and other psychologists are experts at psychotherapy (typically [[clinical psychologists]] are trained in a number of psychological therapies, including, behavioural, cognitive, humanistic, existential, psychodynamic, and systemic approaches), and [[psychological testing]] (e.g. including [[neuropsychological test]]ing). In two US states, specifically [[New Mexico]] and [[Louisiana]], some psychologists with post-doctoral pharmacology training have been granted [[RxP|prescriptive authority]] for certain mental health disorders upon agreement with the patient's physician.<ref>{{cite web | title = Louisiana grants psychologists prescriptive authority | url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/louisianarx.html | date = 5 May 2004 | accessdate = 16 July 2009}}</ref>
