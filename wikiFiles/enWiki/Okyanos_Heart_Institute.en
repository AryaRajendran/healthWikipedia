==History & name origin==
Okyanos Heart Institute was officially founded on August 2, 2011 by Matt Feshbach, Joseph Feshbach and Manuel Vianna. Joseph Feshbach died on August 12, 2011 of a sudden cardiac arrest.

The name [[Okeanos|Okyanos]] stems from the Greek God of Rivers, Okeanos, as mentioned in [[Homer|Homer’s]] the ''[[Iliad]]'', which is the deity of the great earth-encircling river Okyanos – the source of all the earth’s fresh-water. The name is used to symbolize the current understanding that adult stem and regenerative cells derived from [[Adipose tissue|adipose (fat) tissue]] aid in restoring blood flow to [[ischemic]] (blood-deprived) tissue.<ref>Cytori.com. [http://www.cytori.com/Innovations/ScienceandTechnology.aspx Science and Technology]. Retrieved 2012-09-17.</ref>

==Cardiac cell therapy==
Physician-scientists have explored the clinical application of many types of adult stem and regenerative cells, including those derived from adult bone marrow<ref>Clifford DM, Fisher SA, Brunskill SJ, et al. Stem cell treatment for acute myocardial infarction. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2012. Available at: http://www.cochrane.org.</ref> and adipose tissue.<ref>6. Sanz-Ruiz R, Fernández-Santos E, Domínguez-Muñoa M, et al. Early translation of adipose derived cell therapy for cardiovascular disease. Cell Transplantation 2009; 18:1-10.</ref> Over the years, positive results have been reported by many of these studies, while many experts are also quick to point out that such studies have used few patients and additional investigation is warranted.<ref>[http://www.theheart.org www.theheart.org]. Stem Cell Therapy Still Needs A Lot More Study. Retrieved 2012-09-17.</ref> There are currently over 450 studies referenced in clinicaltrials.gov under a keyword search of stem cell AND [[cardiac disease]]. Over 200 are either actively recruiting or have an unknown recruitment status.<ref>[http://www.clinicaltrials.gov www.clinicaltrials.gov] </ref> While bone marrow has served as the primary source of cells for most studies, others have reported encouraging outcomes with cells such as adipose derived stem cells after [[myocardial infarction]].<ref>Houtgraaf JH, den Dekker WK, et al. First experience in humans using adipose tissue-derived regenerative cells in the treatment of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2012; 59(5):539.</ref>

There a number of scientific programs dedicated to the discussion of cardiac cell therapy. In the United States, the Conference on Cell Therapy for Cardiac Disease has been held annually in New York for the past seven years. In Europe, the International Symposium on Stem Cell Therapy and Cardiovascular Innovations has been held for the past nine years. These meetings bring together international leaders in the field of cardiac cell therapy to discuss the latest results, review emerging trends, and discuss the future direction of this therapeutic approach.

==The Okyanos Procedure==
Cardiac Cell Therapy, a treatment for chronic coronary artery disease, is done on an outpatient basis at Okyanos Heart Institute and is minimally-invasive. The Okyanos Procedure is centered on the use of a patient’s own adipose derived stem and regenerative cells (ADRCs) derived from fat tissue.  The choice of fat as a tissue source is based on the fact that excess fat is often available and easy to access. In addition, ADRCs have been shown, relative to other tissue sources such as bone marrow, to be over 2,000 times more plentiful.<ref>D'Ippolito, G., et al., Age-related osteogenic potential of mesenchymal stromal stem cells from human vertebral bone marrow. J Bone Miner Res, 1999. 14(7): p. 1115-22.</ref> The PRECISE study, sponsored by Cytori Therapeutics, evaluated the use of freshly isolated ADRCs for the treatment of chronic, no-option [[Ischaemic heart disease|myocardial ischemia]] patients. The double-blinded prospective study was performed in both Spain and The Netherlands at leading institutions. The last data reported on the PRECISE study was 18 month follow-up which demonstrated safety and improvement in heart function for patients treated with cells relative to those treated with placebo.<ref>Cardiology Today. [http://www.healio.com/cardiology/vascular-medicine/news/print/cardiology-today/%7B9E4CCD84-A520-49A8-9975-1486C18795F1%7D/PRECISE-Adipose-derived-stem-cells-show-utility-as-therapy PRECISE: Adipose-derived stem cells show utility as therapy]. April 2011. Retrieved 2012-07-17.</ref>

The clinic’s treatment approach involves three steps and uses a European Union approved cell processing device to treat chronic coronary artery disease patients and [[congestive heart failure]]. The steps are as follows:

# Approximately 1 cup of adipose (fat) tissue is removed from each patient by liposuction.
# Viable adipose-derived stem and regenerative cells (ADRCs) are extracted from the patient’s fat tissue and concentrated at the point-of-care. This takes approximately one hour.
# Immediately thereafter, a cardiologist performs a catheterization to guide the delivery of cells into the ischemic (low blood flow) regions of the heart.<ref>Okyanos.com. [http://okyanos.com/stem-cells-heart/cell-therapy-treatment/ The Procedure]. Retrieved 2012-09-17.</ref>

The Okyanos procedure is performed in a cardiac catheterization lab by a U.S. licensed chief cardiologist, Dr. Howard Walpole.<ref>Dr. Howard Walpole. [http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=23955750&locale=en_US&trk=tyah2 LinkedIn Profile]. Retrieved 2012-07-17.</ref>
