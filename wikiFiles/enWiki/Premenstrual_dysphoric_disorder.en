'''Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)''' is a severe form of [[premenstrual syndrome]],<ref>"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is the severe form of PMS." http://patients.uptodate.com/topic.asp?file=endocrin/10662 
</ref> afflicting 3% to 8% of women.<ref>PMDD affects 

"... 3-8% of women of reproductive age. Assessment of published reports demonstrate that the prevalence of clinically relevant dysphoric premenstrual disorder is probably higher. 13-18% of women of reproductive age may have premenstrual dysphoric symptoms severe enough to induce impairment and distress, though the number of symptoms may not meet the arbitrary count of 5 symptoms on the PMDD list." PMID 12892987</ref> It is a diagnosis associated primarily with the [[luteal phase]] of the [[menstrual cycle]]. Up to one-third of women diagnosed with PMDD report residual symptoms into the first 2 or 3 days of the [[follicular phase]].<ref>Yonkers KA, Pearlstein T, Fayyad R, Gillespie JA.

==Symptoms==
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of [[premenstrual syndrome]] (PMS).  Like PMS, premenstrual dysphoric disorder follows a predictable, cyclic pattern. Symptoms begin in the late [[luteal phase]] of the [[menstrual cycle]] (after ovulation) and end shortly after menstruation begins.<ref name=Steiner>{{cite journal | url = http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/jwh.2006.15.57 | pmid = 16417420 | doi=10.1089/jwh.2006.15.57 | volume=15 | issue=1 | title=Expert guidelines for the treatment of severe PMS, PMDD, and comorbidities: the role of SSRIs | year=2006 | author=Steiner M, Pearlstein T, Cohen LS, ''et al.'' | journal=J Womens Health (Larchmt) | pages=57–69}}</ref> 

Emotional symptoms are generally present, and in PMDD, mood symptoms are dominant.<ref name=Steiner /> Substantial disruption to personal relationships is typical for women with PMDD.<ref name=Steiner /> Anxiety, anger, and depression may also occur. The main symptoms, which can be disabling, include<ref>[http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/premenstrual-syndrome.cfm#g Premenstrual Syndrome: "What is Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD?)"]</ref>

* feelings of deep sadness or despair
* feelings of intense tension or anxiety
* increased intense sensitivity to rejection or criticism
* panic attacks
* rapid and severe mood swings, bouts of uncontrollable crying
* lasting irritability or anger, increased interpersonal conflicts; typically sufferers are unaware of the impact they have on those close to them
* apathy or disinterest in daily activities and relationships
* difficulty concentrating
* chronic fatigue
* food cravings or binge eating
* [[insomnia]] or [[hypersomnia]]; sleeping more than usual, or (in a smaller group of sufferers) being unable to sleep
* feeling overwhelmed or feelings of being out of control
* increase or decrease in sex drive
* increased need for emotional closeness

Common physical symptoms include:
* breast tenderness or swelling, heart palpitations, headaches, joint or muscle pain, swollen face and nose
* an altered view of one's body - a sensation of 'bloating', feeling fat or actual weight gain.
* severe headache

Five or more of these symptoms may indicate PMDD.

==Cause==
In 2007... the first significant genetic finding in premenstrual dysphoric disorder was reported.<ref name="pmid17599809">{{cite journal

Women with these genetic variants were more likely to suffer from PMDD. They also discovered that this association is seen only in women with a variant form of another gene, [[Catechol-O-methyl transferase]] also known as COMT, which is involved in regulating the function of the [[prefrontal cortex]], a critical regulator of mood.

Previously, research showed that women with PMDD have an abnormal response to normal hormone levels, and, thus, are differentially sensitive to their own natural hormone changes. 

There is objective correlational evidence of a neurological connection for PMDD distress. The self-rated cardinal mood symptoms of women suffering premenstrual dysphoria was found to be significantly correlated with the concomitant worsening of their brain serotonin precursors, measured by [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).<ref name="pmid16515859">{{cite journal

While the cause of PMDD has not been definitively established, a leading theory suggests it is due to the lack of [[serotonin]] (a [[neurotransmitter]]) and mediated by the fluctuations of the levels of sex hormones ([[progesterone]], [[estrogen]], and [[testosterone]]) in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.<ref name="pmid16515859"/>

Supporting the hypothesized important role of [[serotonin]], a number of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) have been shown<ref name="Steiner"/> in clinical trials to effectively treat the mood component of PMDD when taken during the dysphoric phase, as detailed in the treatment section below.

Women with PMDD who have never experienced [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD) have lower sensitivity and response to stress and pain than people with a [[Major Depressive Disorder|MDD]].<ref name="pmid20138113">{{cite journal

General life stress is also associated with the prevalence of PMDD and the severity of symptoms. <ref>Pilver, C, Desai, R, Kasl, S & Levy, B, 2011, ‘Lifetime Discrimination Associated with Greater Likelihood of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder’, ''Journal of Women’s Health'', vol. 20, no. 6, pp. 923-931.</ref> Research shows that perceived discrimination is a stressor associated with the lifetime prevalence of PMDD. <ref>Pilver, C, Desai, R, Kasl, S & Levy, B, 2011, ‘Lifetime Discrimination Associated with Greater Likelihood of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder’, ''Journal of Women’s Health'', vol. 20, no. 6, pp. 923-931.</ref> The experience of subtle forms of gender and race discrimination is correlated with PMDD among ethnic minority women. <ref>Pilver, C, Desai, R, Kasl, S & Levy, B, 2011, ‘Lifetime Discrimination Associated with Greater Likelihood of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder’, ''Journal of Women’s Health'', vol. 20, no. 6, pp. 923-931.</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Originally called '''late luteal phase dysphoric disorder''' (LLPDD), the disorder was renamed PMDD by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in its May 1993 revision of the [[DSM-IV]]. It was not recognized as a disorder in the DSM-IV, but was noted in the appendix of the manual as a "disorder requiring further study."<ref>{{cite news| author=Laurence, Leslie | title=Psychiatric group scruitinzes categorizing form of PMS | publisher=Chicago Tribune | date=1993-05-16 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| author=Lehman, Betsy | title=A little revision is creating a big furor |publisher=Boston Globe| date=1993-05-10}}</ref>  The [[DSM-5]], due for release in 2013, recognizes PMDD and gives precise and sophisticated guidelines for diagnosis.<ref>D 04 Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder 

http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevision/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=484</ref>  The DSM-5 draft resembles the expert guidelines<ref name="Steiner"/> for the treatment of severe PMS, PMDD, and comorbidities proposed by Steiner and co-authors.  

PMDD is accepted as an illness by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) but has not as yet been listed as a separate disorder in the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD|International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10)]]. Listing may be imminent, however, since the current alpha draft of ICD-11 extends recognition,<ref>[http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd11/browse/f/en#/http%3A%2F%2Fwho.int%2Ficd%232772_712a6f06_71f2_48d0_919c_2b3cb8b7172d ICD11 Beta   Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)   retrieved Oct. 17, 2012]</ref> albeit in a way lacking the clinical sophistication of the [[DSM-5]] approach.  

In 2003, the manufacturer of Prozac (fluoxetine) was required by the [[Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products]] to remove PMDD from the list of indications for fluoxetine sold in Europe.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Controversial disease dropped from Prozac product information| author=Ray Moynihan | journal = BMJ | volume=328 | date=2004-02-14 | pages = 7436 | pmid=14962861 | doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7436.365| issue=7436| pmc=341379}}</ref> Reflecting the approach of the ICD-10, the committee found that 
<blockquote> ...PMDD is not a well-established disease entity across Europe... There was considerable concern that women with less severe pre-menstrual symptoms might erroneously receive a diagnosis of PMDD resulting in widespread inappropriate short and long-term use of fluoxetine.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emea.eu.int/pdfs/human/referral/326303en.pdf | title=Summary Information...for Prozac and associated names| author=European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products| date=2003-06-13}}</ref></blockquote>

In Australia, although PMDD is recognized by the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]], SSRIs are not reimbursed for it under the [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]].<ref>[http://www.npsradar.org.au/site.php?page=1&content=/npsradar/content/sertraline.html Sertraline (Zoloft), fluoxetine (Lovan, Prozac) for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)] National Prescribing Service Limited. (Australia)</ref>

Some commentators suggest that PMDD (along with [[heart disease]], [[borderline high blood pressure]], mild [[hypercholesterolemia]], [[social anxiety disorder]], [[restless leg syndrome]], and [[female sexual dysfunction]]) has been marketed by pharmaceutical companies in order to increase the demand for treatments.<ref name="pmid16597181">{{cite journal

== Treatment ==
The primary goal of treatment is to reduce the patient's suffering and the disruption to their social relationships.

[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs) have emerged as first-line therapy.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16417420 | doi=10.1089/jwh.2006.15.57 | volume=15 | issue=1 | title=Expert guidelines for the treatment of severe PMS, PMDD, and comorbidities: the role of SSRIs | year=2006 | author=Steiner M, Pearlstein T, Cohen LS, ''et al.'' | journal=J Womens Health (Larchmt) | pages=57–69}}</ref>  Several randomized, placebo-controlled trials in women with PMDD have clearly demonstrated that the SSRIs have excellent efficacy and minimal side effects.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11041380 | volume=61 Suppl 12 | title=Premenstrual dysphoria and the serotonin system: pathophysiology and treatment | year=2000 | author=Steiner M, Pearlstein T | journal=J Clin Psychiatry | pages=17–21}}</ref><ref>[http://www.4women.gov/FAQ/pms.htm Premenstrual Syndrome<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved four [[SSRI]]s for the treatment of PMDD: [[Fluoxetine]] (available as generic or as Prozac or [[Sarafem]]), [[sertraline]] (Zoloft), [[paroxetine]] (Paxil) and [[escitalopram oxalate]] (Lexapro).

Lifestyle changes such as regular exercise and a well balanced diet may ameliorate some of the effects of PMDD.  [[L-tryptophan]], a serotonin precursor, was found in two studies to provide significant relief when supplemented daily in a large dose.<ref name="pmid10721042">{{cite journal
