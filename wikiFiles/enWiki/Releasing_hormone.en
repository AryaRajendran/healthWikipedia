{{distinguish|Release factor}}

A '''releasing hormone''' or '''releasing factor''' is a [[hormone]] whose main purpose is to control the release of another hormone. The main releasing hormones secreted by the hypothalamus are:

*[[Thyrotropin-releasing hormone]] (TRH),
*[[Corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH),
*[[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH),
*[[Growth hormone-releasing hormone]] (GHRH),

Two other factors are also classed as releasing hormones, although they in fact inhibit pituitary hormone release 

*[[Somatostatin]],
*[[Dopamine]].

For example, TRH is released from the [[hypothalamus]] in response to low levels of secretion of [[thyroid stimulating hormone]] (TSH) from the [[pituitary gland]]. The TSH in turn is under feedback control by the [[thyroid]] hormones [[Thyroxine|T4]] and [[Triiodothyronine|T3]]. When the levels of TSH are too high, they feed back on the brain to shut down the secretion of TRH. Synthetic TRH is also used by physicians as a test of TSH reserve in the pituitary gland as it should stimulate the release of TSH and [[prolactin]] from this gland.

Releasing hormones are sometimes known as liberins. For example, TRH may be known as thyroliberin. Inhibiting hormones may be known as statins. For example, dopamine (which inhibits prolactin release) may be called prolactostatin.

==Mechanism==
Releasing hormones increase (or, in case of inhibitory factors, decrease) the intracellular concentration of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), resulting in [[vesicle fusion]] of the respective primary hormone. 

For GnRH, TRH and GHRH the increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> is achieved by the releasing hormone coupling and activating [[G protein coupled receptors]] coupled to the [[Gq alpha subunit|G<sub>q</sub> alpha subunit]], activating the [[IP3/DAG pathway]] to increase Ca<sup>2+</sup>.<ref name=brsphys237> Page 237 in: {{cite book |author=Costanzo, Linda S. |title=Physiology |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7311-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}} </ref> For GHRH, however, this is a minor pathway, the main one being the [[cAMP dependent pathway]]. <ref name=boron> {{cite book |author=Walter F., PhD.

==Notable researchers==
[[Roger Guillemin]] and [[Andrew W. Schally]] were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1977 for their contributions to understanding "the peptide hormone production of the brain"; these scientists independently first isolated TRH and GnRH and then identified their [[Chemical structure|structures]].<ref>Guillemin R.
