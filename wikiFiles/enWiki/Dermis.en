[[File:EpidermisPainted.svg|thumb|250px|right|A graphic representation of the interface between [[skin]] [[epithelium]] and the underlying [[connective tissue]].  Zone B, indicating the region of overlapping projections of [[epithelium]] and [[connective tissue]], is the [[papillary dermis]].  Zone C, indicating the region of dermis that lies immediately subjacent to the interdigitations of epithelium, is the [[reticular dermis]].]]
The '''dermis''' is a layer of [[skin]] between the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] (with which it makes up the [[cutis (anatomy)|cutis]]) and [[subcutaneous tissue]]s, that consists of [[connective tissue]] and cushions the [[body]] from [[stress (biology)|stress]] and strain. It is divided into two layers, the superficial area adjacent to the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] called the [[papillary dermis|papillary]] region and a deep thicker area known as the [[reticular dermis]].<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology'' (10th ed.). Saunders. Pages 1, 11–12. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref>  The dermis is tightly connected to the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] through a [[basement membrane]]. Structural components of the dermis are [[collagen]], [[elastic fiber]]s, and extrafibrillar matrix (previously called [[ground substance]]).<ref name="Lookingbill">Marks, James G; Miller, Jeffery (2006). ''Lookingbill and Marks' Principles of Dermatology'' (4th ed.). Elsevier Inc. Page 8–9. ISBN 1-4160-3185-5.</ref> It also contains [[Mechanoreceptor]]s that provide the sense of [[touch]] and [[heat]], [[hair follicles]], [[sweat glands]], [[sebaceous glands]], [[apocrine glands]], [[lymphatic vessels]] and [[blood vessels]]. Those [[blood vessels]] provide nourishment and waste removal for both dermal and [[epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] [[cell (biology)|cells]].

==Components of the Dermis==
The dermis is composed of three major types of [[cell (biology)|cells]]:<ref name="ageingskin">[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2011/03/the-ageing-skin-part-1-structure-of-skin-and-introduction/ The Ageing Skin - Structure]</ref>
[[Fibroblasts]], [[Macrophages]], and [[Adipocytes]].

Apart from these [[cell (biology)|cells]], the dermis is also composed of [[matrix (biology)|matrix]] components such as [[collagen]] (which provides [[strength of materials|strength]]), [[elastin]] (which provides [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]), the epidermis, and [[glycosaminoglycans]].<ref name="ageingskin"/>

==Layers==

===Stratum papillare===
The papillary region is composed of loose [[areolar connective tissue]]. This is named for its fingerlike projections called ''papillae'', that extend toward the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and contain either terminal networks of [[blood]] [[capillaries]] or tactile [[Meissner's corpuscles]].<ref>http://microvet.arizona.edu/Courses/vsc422/secure/VSC422AppledHistologyLabHandout.pdf</ref>

===Stratum reticulare===
The reticular region lies under the papillary region and is usually much thicker. It is composed of dense irregular [[connective tissue]], and receives its name from the dense concentration of [[collagenous]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]], and [[reticular]] fibers that weave throughout it. These [[protein]] fibers give the dermis its properties of [[strength of materials|strength]], [[extensibility]], and [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. Also located within the reticular region are the [[roots of the hair]], [[sebaceous glands]], [[sweat glands]], [[Cutaneous receptor|receptors]], [[nail (anatomy)|nails]], and [[blood vessels]].
