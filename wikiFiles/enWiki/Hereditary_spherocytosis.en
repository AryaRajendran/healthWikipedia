'''Hereditary spherocytosis''' is a genetically-transmitted (autosomal [[Dominance_(genetics)|dominant]]) form of [[spherocytosis]], an auto-[[hemolysis|hemolytic]] [[anemia]] characterized by the production of red blood cells that are sphere-shaped rather than bi-concave disk shaped (donut-shaped), and therefore more prone to hemolysis.<ref name="isbn0-7216-0187-1">{{cite book |author=Cotran, Ramzi S.; Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelson; Nelso Fausto; Robbins, Stanley L.; Abbas, Abul K. |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005 |page=625 |isbn=0-7216-0187-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  

On a blood smear, [[Howell-Jolly bodies]] may be seen within red blood cells.  
 
Signs and symptoms include anemia, jaundice, and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly).  

==Epidemiology==
It is the most common disorder of the red cell membrane, affecting 1 in 2,000 people of Northern European ancestry. According to [[Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine]], the frequency is at least 1 in 5,000.<ref name=HarrisonsInternal />

==Signs and Symptoms==
As in [[spherocytosis|non-hereditary spherocytosis]], the [[spleen]] destroys the abnormal spherocytes.  This [[hemolysis]] results directly in varying degrees of [[anemia]] (causing pallor and [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]), hyperbilirubinemia (causing [[jaundice]]), and [[splenomegaly]].  

Acute cases can threaten to cause [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] through [[anemia]] and acute [[kernicterus]] through hyperbilirubinemia, particularly in newborns.  Most cases can be detected soon after birth.  An adult with this disease should have their children tested, although the presence of the disease in children is usually noticed soon after birth. Occasionally, the disease will not be noticed until the child is about 4 or 5 years of age. 

Chronic symptoms include [[anemia]], increased blood viscosity, and [[splenomegaly]].<ref name=Dx&TxGuidelines>{{cite pmid|15287938}}</ref> Furthermore, the detritus of the broken-down blood cells—unconjugated or indirect [[bilirubin]]--accumulates in the [[gallbladder]], and can cause [[pigmented gallstones]] or "sludge" to develop.  In chronic patients, an [[infection]] or other illness can cause an increase in the destruction of red blood cells, resulting in the appearance of acute symptoms, a ''hemolytic crisis''. Spherocytosis patients who are heterozygous for a hemochromatosis gene may suffer from iron overload despite the hemochromatosis genes being recessive <ref>{{cite web|author=J L Rasmussen, D A Odelson, and F L Macrina |url=http://ukpmc.ac.uk/classic/articlerender.cgi?artid=1296185 |title=Complete nucleotide sequence of insertion element IS4351 from Bacteroides fragilis. - UKPMC Article - UK PubMed Central |publisher=UKPMC Article |date=1987-08-01 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcshguidelines.com/documents/HS_BCSH_Sept_2011_final.pdf |title=Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Hereditary Spherocytosis |author=Paula Bolton-Maggs |date=September 2011 |work= |publisher=The British Committee for Standards in Haematology |accessdate=2 July 2012}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
In a [[peripheral blood smear]], the [[red blood cell]]s will ''appear'' abnormally small and lack the central pallor that is present in normal red blood cells.  These changes are also seen in non-hereditary spherocytosis, but they are typically more marked in hereditary spherocytosis.  The number of immature red blood cells ([[reticulocyte]] count) will be elevated.<ref name=Dx&TxGuidelines />  

Other protein deficiencies cause [[hereditary elliptocytosis]], [[pyropoikilocytosis]] or [[stomatocytosis]].

In longstanding cases and in patients who have taken [[iron]] supplementation or received numerous [[blood transfusion]]s, [[iron overload]] may be a significant problem, being a potential cause of [[cardiomyopathy]] and [[liver disease]]. Measuring iron stores is therefore considered part of the diagnostic approach to hereditary spherocytosis.

An osmotic fragility test can aid in the diagnosis.<ref name="pmid18727072">{{cite journal |author=Won DI, Suh JS |title=Flow cytometric detection of erythrocyte osmotic fragility |journal=Cytometry B Clin Cytom |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=135–41 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=18727072 |doi=10.1002/cyto.b.20448}}</ref> In this test, the spherocytes will rupture in mildly hypotonic solutions - this is due to increased permeability of the spherocyte membrane to salt and water.<ref>Goljan. Rapid Review Pathology. 2010. Page 213.</ref> Although the osmotic fragility test is widely considered the [[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for diagnosing hereditary spherocytosis, it misses as many as 25% of cases. Flow cytometric analysis of eosin-5′-maleimide-labeled intact red blood cells and the acidified glycerol lysis test are two additional options to aid diagnosis.<ref>{{cite pmid|22058213}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Hereditary spherocytosis is an [[autosomal dominant]] or recessive trait,<ref name="pmid15071790">{{cite journal |author=Eber S, Lux SE |title=Hereditary spherocytosis--defects in proteins that connect the membrane skeleton to the lipid bilayer |journal=Semin.

A patient has a 50% chance of passing the mutation onto each of his/her offspring.

Hereditary spherocytosis is caused by a variety of molecular defects in the genes that code for [[spectrin]] ([[SPTA1|alpha]] and [[SPTB|beta]]), [[ankyrin]],<ref name="pmid9887280">{{cite journal |author=Gallagher PG, Forget BG |title=Hematologically important mutations: spectrin and ankyrin variants in hereditary spherocytosis |journal=Blood Cells Mol.

These proteins are necessary to maintain the normal shape of an erythrocyte, which is a biconcave disk.  The integrating protein that is most commonly defective is [[ankyrin]] which is responsible for incorporation and binding of spectrin, thus in its dysfunction cytoskeletal instabilities ensue. As the spleen normally targets abnormally shaped red cells (which are typically older), it also destroys spherocytes. In the spleen, the passage from the [[cords of Billroth]] into the sinusoids may be seen as a bottleneck, where erythrocytes need to be flexible in order to pass through. In hereditary spherocytosis, erythrocytes fail to pass through and get phagocytosed, causing [[extravascular hemolysis]].<ref name=Kumar425>Chapter 12, page 425 in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.</ref>

==Complications==

* Hemolytic crisis, with more pronounced jaundice due to accelerated hemolysis (may be precipitated by infection).
* Aplastic crisis with dramatic fall in hemoglobin level and (reticulocyte count)-decompensation, usually due to maturation arrest and often associated with megaloblastic changes; may be precipitated by infection, such as influenza, notably with [[parvovirus B19]].<ref>{{cite pmid|1658972}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|9308316}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|17304869}}</ref>
* [[Folate deficiency]] caused by increased bone marrow requirement.
* [[Pigmented gallstones]] occur in approximately half of untreated patients. Increased hemolysis of red blood cells leads to increased bilirubin levels, because bilirubin is a breakdown product of [[heme]]. The high levels of bilirubin must be excreted into the bile by the liver, which may cause the formation of a pigmented gallstone, which is composed of calcium bilirubinate. Since these stones contain high levels of calcium carbonates and phosphate, they are radiopaque and are visible on x-ray.  
* Leg ulcer.
* Abnormally low [[hemoglobin A1C]] levels.<ref>IKutter, D. and Thoma, J. (2006) 'Hereditary spherocytosis and other hemolytic anomalies distort diabetic control by glycated hemoglobin', Clinical Laboratory, 52(9-10), 477-481.</ref> Hemoglobin A1C (glycated hemoglobin) is a test for determining the average blood glucose levels over an extended period of time, and is often used to evaluate glucose control in diabetics. The hemoglobin A1C levels are abnormally low because the life span of the red blood cells is decreased, providing less time for the non-enzymatic glycosylation of hemoglobin. Thus, even with high overall blood sugar, the A1C will be lower than expected.

==Treatment==
At this point, there exists no cure for the genetic defect that causes hereditary spherocytosis.<ref name=HarrisonsInternal /> Current management focuses on interventions that limit the severity of the disease.  Treatment options include: 
* '''Splenectomy''': As in [[spherocytosis|non-hereditary spherocytosis]], acute symptoms of [[anemia]] and hyperbilirubinemia indicate treatment with [[blood transfusion]]s or exchanges and chronic symptoms of anemia and [[splenomegaly]] indicate dietary supplementation of folic acid and [[splenectomy]],<ref name="pmid15287938">{{cite journal |author=Bolton-Maggs PH, Stevens RF, Dodd NJ, Lamont G, Tittensor P, King MJ |title=Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hereditary spherocytosis |journal=Br. J. Haematol. |volume=126 |issue=4 |pages=455–74 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15287938 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.05052.x}}</ref> the surgical removal of the spleen. Splenectomy is indicated for moderate to severe cases, but not mild cases.<ref name=Dx&TxGuidelines /> To decrease the risk of [[sepsis]], post-splenectomy spherocytosis patients require immunization against the pneumococcus bacterium, influenza virus, and prophylactic antibiotic treatment. However, the use of prophylactic antibiotics, such as penicillin, remains controversial.<ref name=HarrisonsInternal>{{cite book|last=Anthony S. Fauci , Eugene Braunwald, Dennis L. Kasper, Stephen L. Hauser, Dan L. Longo, J. Larry Jameson, Joseph Loscalzo|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine|year=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0071466332|pages=Chapter 106|url=http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=9117899|edition=17th ed.}}</ref> 
* '''Partial splenectomy''': Since the spleen is important for protecting against encapsulated organisms, sepsis caused by encapsulated organisms is a possible complication of splenectomy.<ref name=Dx&TxGuidelines /> The option of partial splenectomy may be considered in the interest of preserving immune function. Research on outcomes is currently limited,<ref name=Dx&TxGuidelines /> but favorable.<ref>{{cite pmid|21238662}}</ref>
* Cholecystectomy may be necessary.<ref name=HarrisonsInternal />

==Research==
Experimental [[gene therapy]] exists to treat hereditary spherocytosis in lab mice; however, this treatment has not yet been tried on humans due to all of the risks involved in human gene therapy.
