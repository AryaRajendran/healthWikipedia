'''Histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate''', or '''Custodiol HTK''' solution is a high-flow, low-[[potassium]] preservation solution used for [[organ transplantation]]. 

HTK solution is intended for [[perfusion]] and flushing of donor liver kidney, heart, lung and pancreas prior to removal from the donor and for preserving these organs during [[hypothermic]] storage and transport to the recipient. HTK solution is based on the principle of inactivating organ function by withdrawal of [[extracellular]] [[sodium]] and [[calcium]], together with intensive [[Buffer solution|buffering]] of the extracellular space by means of [[histidine]]/histidine hydrochloride, so as to prolong the period during which the organs will tolerate interruption of [[oxygenated blood]]. The composition of HTK is similar to that of [[extracellular fluid]]. All of the components of HTK occur naturally in the body.
