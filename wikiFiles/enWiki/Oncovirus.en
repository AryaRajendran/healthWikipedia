An '''oncovirus''' is a [[virus]] that can cause [[cancer]].  This term originated from studies of acutely transforming [[retroviruses]] in the 1950–60s, often called oncornaviruses to denote their RNA virus origin.   It now refers to any virus with a DNA or RNA genome causing cancer and is synonymous with "tumor virus" or "cancer virus".  The vast majority of human and animal viruses do not cause cancer, probably because of long-standing coevolution between the virus and its host.

Worldwide, the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer estimated that in 2002 17.8% of human cancers were caused by infection, with 11.9% being caused by one of seven different viruses.<ref name=Parkin06>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/ijc.21731 |title=The global health burden of infection-associated cancers in the year 2002 |year=2006 |last1=Parkin |first1=Donald Maxwell |journal=International Journal of Cancer |volume=118 |pmid=16404738 |issue=12|pages=3030–44}}</ref>  The importance of this is that these cancers might be easily prevented through vaccination (e.g., [[HPV vaccine|papillomavirus vaccines]]), diagnosed with simple blood tests, and treated with less-toxic antiviral compounds.

==Background==
Generally, tumor viruses cause little or no disease after infection in their hosts, or cause non-[[neoplastic]] diseases such as acute hepatitis for [[hepatitis B virus]] or mononucleosis for [[Epstein-Barr virus]].  A minority of persons (or animals) will go on to develop cancers after infection.  This has complicated determining whether or not a given virus causes cancer.  The well-known [[Koch's Postulates]], are 19th-century constructs developed by [[Robert Koch]] to establish the likelihood for Bacillus anthracis causing [[anthrax]] disease and are not applicable to viral diseases (Firstly, viruses cannot truly be isolated in pure culture - even stringent isolation techniques cannot exclude undetected contaminating viruses with similar density characteristics and viruses must be grown on cells.  Secondly, asymptomatic virus infection and carriage is the norm for most tumor viruses, which violates Koch's third principle.  Relman and Fredericks have elegantly described the difficulties in using Koch's postulates to virus-induced cancers.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Fredericks DN, Relman DA |title=Sequence-based identification of microbial pathogens: a reconsideration of Koch's postulates |journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=18–33 |year=1996 |month=January |pmid=8665474 |pmc=172879 |url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8665474}}</ref>  Finally, the host restriction for human viruses makes it unethical to experimentally transmit a suspected cancer virus.)  Thus, other measures such as A.B. [[Hill's criteria]]<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hill AB |title=The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation? |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=58 |issue= 5|pages=295–300 |year=1965 |month=May |pmid=14283879 |pmc=1898525 |url=http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/hill}}</ref> are more relevant to cancer virology but also face some difficulties in determining causality.

Tumor viruses come in a variety of forms: viruses with a [[DNA]] [[genome]], such as [[adenovirus]], and viruses with an RNA genome, like the [[Hepatitis C virus]] (HCV) can cause cancers, as can retroviruses having both DNA and RNA genomes ([[Human T-lymphotropic virus]] and [[hepatitis B virus]], which normally replicates as a mixed double and single-stranded DNA virus but also has a retroviral replication component).  In many cases, tumor viruses do not cause cancer in their native hosts but only in dead-end species.  For example, adenoviruses do not cause cancer in humans but are instead responsible for colds, conjunctivitis and other acute illnesses.  They only become tumorigenic when infected into certain rodent species, such as Syrian hamsters.  Some viruses are tumorigenic when they infect a cell and persist as circular [[episome]]s or plasmids, replicating separately from host cell DNA ([[Epstein-Barr virus]] and [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus]]).  Other viruses are only carcinogenic when they integrate into the host cell genome as part of a biological accident, such as polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses.

A direct oncogenic viral mechanism<ref>{{Cite book|author=Parsonnet, Julie |title=Microbes and malignancy: infection as a cause of human cancers |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=978-0-19-510401-1}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> involves either insertion of  additional viral oncogenic genes into the host cell or to enhance already existing oncogenic genes ([[proto-oncogenes]]) in the genome.  Indirect viral oncogenicity involves chronic nonspecific inflammation occurring over decades of infection, as is the case for HCV-induced liver cancer. These two mechanisms differ in their biology and epidemiology: direct tumor viruses must have at least one virus copy in every tumor cell expressing at least one protein or RNA that is causing the cell to become cancerous.  Because foreign virus [[antigens]] are expressed in these tumors, persons who are immunosuppressed such as AIDS or transplant patients are at higher risk for these types of cancers.   Chronic indirect tumor viruses, on the other hand, can be lost (at least theoretically) from a mature tumor that has accumulated sufficient mutations and growth conditions (hyperplasia) from the chronic inflammation of viral infection.  In this latter case, it is controversial but at least theoretically possible that an indirect tumor virus could undergo "hit-and-run" and so the virus would be lost from the clinically diagnosed tumor.  In practical terms, this is an uncommon occurrence if it does occur.

==Timeline of Discovery==
*'''1908:''' Oluf Bang and Vilhelm Ellerman, University of Copenhagen, first demonstrated that [[avian sarcoma leukosis virus]] could be transmitted after cell-free filtration to new chickens, causing leukemia.
*'''1910:''' [[Peyton Rous]] at Rockefeller extended Bang and Ellerman's experiments to show filtrable cell-free transmission of a solid tumor sarcoma to chickens.  The reasons why chickens are so receptive to such transmission may involve unusual characteristics of stability or instability as they relate to [[endogenous retroviruses]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Peyton Rous: father of the tumor virus |journal=The Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=201 |issue=3 |page=320 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15756727 |pmc=2213042 |doi=10.1084/jem.2013fta |last1=Van Epps |first1=Heather L.}}</ref>

*'''1961:''' Simian Vacuolating virus 40 ([[SV40]]) discovered by Eddy at NIH, and Hillman and Sweet at Merck laboratory as a rhesus macaque virus contaminating cells used to make of Salk and Sabin polio vaccines.

==History==
The theory that cancer could be caused by a virus began with the experiments of Oluf Bang and Vilhelm Ellerman in 1908 who first show that avian erythroblastosis (a form of chicken leukemia) could be transmitted by cell-free extracts.  This was subsequently confirmed for solid tumors in chickens in 1910-1911 by [[Peyton Rous]].

By the early 1950s it was known that viruses could remove and incorporate genes and genetic material in cells. It was suggested that these new genes inserted into cells could make the cell cancerous. Many of these [[viral oncogenes]] have been discovered and identified to cause cancer.

The main viruses associated with human cancers are [[human papillomavirus]], hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus, [[Epstein-Barr virus]], [[human T-lymphotropic virus]], [[Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus]](KSHV) and [[Merkel cell polyomavirus]]. Experimental and epidemiological data imply a causative role for viruses and they appear to be the second most important risk factor for cancer development in humans, exceeded only by tobacco usage.<ref name="zur Hausen-viruses">{{Cite journal|author=zur Hausen H |title=Viruses in human cancers |journal=Science |volume=254 |issue=5035 |pages=1167–73 |year=1991 |month=November |pmid=1659743 |doi=10.1126/science.1659743}}</ref> The mode of virally induced tumors can be divided into two, ''acutely transforming'' or ''slowly transforming''. In acutely transforming viruses, the viral particles carry a gene that encodes for an overactive oncogene called viral-oncogene (v-onc), and the infected cell is transformed as soon as v-onc is expressed. In contrast, in slowly transforming viruses, the virus genome is inserted, especially as viral genome insertion is an obligatory part of [[retrovirus]]es, near a proto-oncogene in the host genome. The viral [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] or other transcription regulation elements in turn cause overexpression of that proto-oncogene, which in turn induces uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Because viral genome insertion is not specific to proto-oncogenes and the chance of insertion near that proto-oncogene is low, slowly transforming viruses have very long tumor latency compared to acutely transforming viruses, which already carry the viral oncogene.

Hepatitis viruses, including [[hepatitis B]] and [[hepatitis C]], can induce a chronic viral infection that leads to [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] in 0.47% of hepatitis B patients per year (especially in Asia, less so in North America), and in 1.4% of hepatitis C carriers per year. Liver cirrhosis, whether from chronic viral hepatitis infection or alcoholism, is associated with the development of liver cancer, and the combination of cirrhosis and viral hepatitis presents the highest risk of liver cancer development. Worldwide, liver cancer is one of the most common, and most deadly, cancers due to a huge burden of [[viral hepatitis]] transmission and disease.

Advances in cancer research have made a vaccines designed to prevent cancer. The hepatitis B vaccine is the first vaccine that has been established to prevent cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) by preventing infection with the causative virus.  In 2006, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] approved a [[human papilloma virus]] vaccine, called [[Gardasil]]. The vaccine protects against four HPV types, which together cause 70% of cervical cancers and 90% of genital warts. In March 2007, the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]] (ACIP) officially recommended that females aged 11–12 receive the vaccine, and indicated that females as young as age 9 and as old as age 26 are also candidates for immunization.

==Small DNA tumor viruses==
Small DNA tumor viruses are a group of double-stranded DNA viruses, made up of the polyomavirus, the adenovirus and the papillomavirus families. The causal link between papillomaviruses and some human cancers is well known and a role for polyomavirus in human cancer has recently been established.<ref name= GastonK>{{cite book | author= Gaston, K (editor) | year=2012 | title=Small DNA Tumor Viruses | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-904455-99-8}}</ref> Adenoviruses do not cause cancer in humans but these viruses have been exploited as delivery vehicles in gene therapy for diseases such as cystic fibrosis and cancer.<ref name="GastonK" />

==Mechanism==

===Brief history===
In the 1960s, the replication process of RNA virus was believed to be similar to other single-stranded RNA. Single-stranded RNA replication involves RNA-dependent RNA synthesis which meant that virus-coding enzymes would make partial double-stranded RNA. This belief was proven to be incorrect because there were no double-stranded RNA found in the retrovirus cell. In 1964, Howard Temin proposed a provirus hypothesis, but shortly after reverse transcription in the retrovirus genome was discovered.

===Description of virus===
All retroviruses have three major coding domains; ''gag, pol and env''. In the ''gag'' region of the virus, the synthesis of the internal virion proteins are maintained which make up the matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid proteins. In ''pol'', the information for the reverse transcription and integration enzymes are stored. In ''env'', it is derived from the surface and transmembrane for the viral envelope protein. There is a fourth coding domain which is smaller, but exists in all retroviruses. ''Pol'' is the domain that encodes the virion protease.

===Retrovirus enters host cell===
The retrovirus begins the journey into a host cell by attaching a surface glycoprotein to the cell's plasma membrane receptor. Once inside the cell, the retrovirus goes through reverse transcription in the cytoplasm and generates a double-stranded DNA copy of the RNA genome. Reverse transcription also produces identical structures known as long terminal repeats (LTRs). Long terminal repeats are at the ends of the DNA strands and regulates viral gene expression. The viral DNA is then translocated into the nucleus where one strand of the retroviral genome is put into the chromosomal DNA by the help of the virion intergrase. At this point the retrovirus is referred to as provirus. Once in the chromosomal DNA, the provirus is transcribed by the cellular RNA polymerase II. The transcription leads to the splicing and full-length mRNAs and full-length progeny virion RNA. The virion protein and progeny RNA assemble in the cytoplasm and leave the cell, whereas the other copies send translated viral messages in the cytoplasm

==Classification==

===DNA viruses===
*[[Human papilloma virus]] (HPV), a DNA virus, causes [[Malignant transformation|transformation]] in cells through interfering with tumor suppressor proteins such as [[p53]]. Interfering with the action of p53 allows a cell infected with the virus to move into a different stage of the cell cycle, enabling the virus genome to be replicated. Forcing the cell into the S phase of the [[cell cycle]] could cause the cell to become transformed.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Scheffner M, Werness BA, Huibregtse JM, Levine AJ, Howley PM |title=The E6 oncoprotein encoded by human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 promotes the degradation of p53 |journal=Cell |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=1129–36 |year=1990 |month=December |pmid=2175676 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(90)90409-8}}</ref> Some types of HPV increase the risk of, e.g., [[cervical cancer]].
