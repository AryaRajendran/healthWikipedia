'''Basic natriuretic peptide''' (BNP), now known as '''B-type natriuretic peptide''' (also BNP) or '''GC-B''', is a 32 amino acid polypeptide secreted by the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] of the [[heart]] in response to excessive stretching of heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes). The release of BNP is modulated by calcium ions. <ref>Ziskoven D, Forssmann WG, Holthausen U, Menz G, Addicks K, Rippegater G:  Calcium Calmodulinantagonists Influences the release of Cardiodilatin/ANP from Atrial Cardiocytes. Handbook Endocrinology of the Heart,  edited by Kaufmann W, Wambach G, 01/1989; Springer Verlag Berlin Heidelberg New York; [http://www.lehmanns.de/shop/medizin-pharmazie/3614509-9783540514091-endocrinology-of-the-heart ISBN/EAN 978-3-540-51409-1]</ref>  BNP is named as such because it was originally identified in extracts of [[pig|porcine]] brain, although in humans it is produced mainly in the cardiac ventricles.

BNP is secreted along with a 76 amino acid N-terminal fragment ([[NT-proBNP]]) which is biologically inactive. BNP binds to and activates the atrial natriuretic factor receptors [[Atrial natriuretic factor receptor|NPRA]], and to a lesser extent [[Atrial natriuretic factor receptor|NPRB]], in a fashion similar to [[atrial natriuretic peptide]] (ANP) but with 10-fold lower affinity. The [[biological half-life]] of BNP, however, is twice as long as that of [[Atrial natriuretic peptide|ANP]], and that of NT-proBNP is even longer, making these peptides better targets than ANP for diagnostic blood testing.

The physiologic actions of BNP are similar to ANP and include decrease in [[systemic circulation|systemic]] [[vascular resistance]] and central venous pressure as well as an increase in [[natriuresis]].  Thus, the net effect of BNP and ANP is a decrease in blood volume which lowers systemic blood pressure and afterload, yielding an increase in cardiac output, partly due to a higher ejection fraction.

== Diagnostic significance ==

*The main clinical utility of either BNP or NT-BNP is that a normal level rules out acute heart failure in the emergency setting. <ref name="pmid12124404">{{cite journal |author=Maisel A, Krishnaswamy P, Nowak R, McCord J, Hollander J, Duc P, Omland T, Storrow A, Abraham W, Wu A, Clopton P, Steg P, Westheim A, Knudsen C, Perez A, Kazanegra R, Herrmann H, McCullough P |title=Rapid measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide in the emergency diagnosis of heart failure |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=347 |issue=3 |pages=161–7 |year=2002 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa020233|pmid=12124404}}</ref>

BNP less than 100 pg per milliliter
* [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] = 90%
* [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] = 76%

BNP less than 50 pg per milliliter
* [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] = 97%
* [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] = 62%

* some laboratories report in units ng per Litre (ng/L) which is equivalent to pg/ml
*For patients with congestive heart failure, BNP values will generally be above 100 pg/ml.
*A more conservative interpretation of the BNP is that normal values are less than 50 pg/ml, in order to achieve adequate sensitivity.
*There is a diagnostic 'gray area', often defined as between 100 and 500 pg/ml, for which the test is considered inconclusive, but levels above 500 pg/ml are generally considered to be positive.

The BNP test is used as an aid in the diagnosis and assessment of severity of congestive heart failure (also referred to as heart failure). A recent meta-analysis concerning effects of BNP testing on clinical outcomes of patients presenting to the emergency department with acute dyspnea revealed that BNP testing led to a decrease in admission rates and decrease in mean length of stay, although neither were statistically significant. Effects on all cause hospital mortality was inconclusive.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=21135296|year=2010|last1=Lam|first1=LL|last2=Cameron|first2=PA|last3=Schneider|first3=HG|last4=Abramson|first4=MJ|last5=Müller|first5=C|last6=Krum|first6=H|title=Meta-analysis: effect of B-type natriuretic peptide testing on clinical outcomes in patients with acute dyspnea in the emergency setting|volume=153|issue=11|pages=728–35|doi=10.1059/0003-4819-153-11-201012070-00006|journal=Annals of internal medicine}}</ref> The BNP test is also used for the risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndromes.<ref name="pmid17213400">{{cite journal | author = Bibbins-Domingo K, Gupta R, Na B, Wu AH, Schiller NB, Whooley MA | title = N-terminal fragment of the prohormone brain-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), cardiovascular events, and mortality in patients with stable coronary heart disease | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–76 | year = 2007 | month = January | pmid = 17213400 | doi = 10.1001/jama.297.2.169 | url = | pmc = 2848442  }}</ref><ref name="pmid16169326">{{cite journal | author = Fitzgerald RL, Cremo R, Gardetto N, Chiu A, Clopton P, Bhalla V, Maisel AS | title = Effect of nesiritide in combination with standard therapy on serum concentrations of natriuretic peptides in patients admitted for decompensated congestive heart failure | journal = Am.

When interpreting an elevated BNP level, it is useful to remember that values may be elevated due to factors other than heart failure.

BNP is also one of the reasons why people will feel the need to urinate after getting into the bathtub or pool. The increased pressure on the body drives more fluid back into systemic circulation which in turn leads to a slight increase in preload. The left ventricle, and to a small degree the left atrium, secrete BNP in response. The natriuretic effect of BNP leads to an increase in urine production.<ref>''Diagnostic Pearls in Cardiorespiratory Disease''. CVMA Yosemite Conference 2010. Bruce Keene, DVM, MSc, DACVIM (Cardiology)</ref>

== Clinical significance ==

Recombinant BNP, [[Nesiritide]] is used to treat decompensated heart failure.  However, a recent clinical trial<ref>O'Connor CM, Starling RC, Hernandez AF, et al. Effect of nesiritide in patients with acute decompensated heart failure. The New England journal of medicine 2011;365:32-43.</ref> failed to show a benefit of nesiritide in patients with acute decompensated heart failure and the authors could not recommend its use.

== Measurement and standardization ==

BNP and NT-proBNP are measured by immunoassay. BNP is standardised whereas NT-proBNP has not been standardised yet.
