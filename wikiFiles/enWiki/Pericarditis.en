[[File:Pericarditis10.JPG|thumb|An ECG showing pericarditis.]]
'''Pericarditis''' is an [[inflammation]] of the [[pericardium]] (the fibrous sac surrounding the [[heart]]). A characteristic [[chest pain]] is often present.

The causes of pericarditis are varied, including viral infections of the pericardium, [[idiopathic]] causes, [[uremic pericarditis]], bacterial infections of the pericardium (e.g., ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''), post-infarct pericarditis (pericarditis due to heart attack; within 24-hours or if weeks-months after: [[Dressler's syndrome]]'s).

==Classification==
Pericarditis can be classified according to the composition of the inflammatory [[exudate]] or in other words the composition of the fluid that accumulates around the heart.<ref>[http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/CVHTML/CVIDX.html images]</ref>

Types include:
* [[serous]]
* [[purulent]]
* [[Uremic pericarditis|fibrinous]]
* [[caseous]]
* [[hemorrhagic]]
* [[Post-infarction pericarditis|Post infarction]]

===Acute vs. chronic===
Depending on the time of presentation and duration, pericarditis is divided into "acute" and "chronic" forms. [[Acute pericarditis]] is more common than chronic pericarditis, and can occur as a complication of infections, immunologic conditions, or even as a result of a heart attack (myocardial infarction). Chronic pericarditis however is less common, a form of which is [[constrictive pericarditis]]. The following is the clinical classification of acute vs. chronic: 

*''Clinically'': Acute (<6 weeks), Subacute (6 weeks to 6 months) and Chronic (>6 months)

==Signs and symptoms==
Substernal or left precordial [[pleuritic]] [[chest pain]] with radiation to the trapezius ridge (the bottom portion of [[scapula]] on the back), which is relieved by sitting up and bending forward and worsened by lying down (recumbent or [[supine position]]) or inspiration (taking a breath in), is the characteristic pain of pericarditis.<ref name=mk>{{cite book |author=American College of Physicians (ACP) |chapter=Pericardial disease |title=Medical Knowledge Self-Assessment Program (MKSAP-15): Cardiovascular Medicine |isbn=9781934465288 |page=64 |url=http://www.acponline.org/products_services/mksap/15/complete.htm}}</ref> The pain may resemble the pain of [[angina pectoris]] or heart attack, but differs in that pain changes with body position, as opposed to heart attack pain that is pressure-like, and constant with radiation to the  left arm and/or the jaw. Other symptoms of pericarditis may include dry [[cough]], [[fever]], fatigue, and [[anxiety]]. Due to similarity to myocardial infarction (heart attack) pain, pericarditis can be misdiagnosed as an acute [[myocardial infarction]] (a heart attack) solely based on the clinical data and so extreme suspicion on the part of the diagnostician is required. Acute [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack) can also cause pericarditis, but the presenting symptoms often differ enough to warrant diagnosis. The following table organises the clinical presentation of pericarditis:<ref name=mk />

|}

===Physical examinations===
The classic [[medical sign|sign]] of pericarditis is a [[pericardial rub|friction rub]] auscultated on the cardiovascular examination usually on the lower left sternal border.<ref name=mk /> Other physical signs include a patient in distress, positional chest pain, diaphoresis (excessive sweating), and possibility of heart failure in form of precardial [[tamponade]] causing [[pulsus paradoxus]], and the [[Beck's triad (cardiology)|Beck's triad]] of hypotension (due to decreased [[cardiac output]]), distant (muffled) heart sounds, and [[JVD]] (jugular vein distention).

===Acute complications===
Pericarditis can progress to pericardial effusion and eventually [[cardiac tamponade]]. This can be seen in patients who are experiencing the classic signs of pericarditis but then show signs of relief, and progress to show signs of cardiac tamponade which include decreased alertness and lethargy, [[pulsus paradoxus]] (decrease of at least 10 mmHg of the systolic blood pressure upon [[Inhalation|inspiration]]), hypotension (due to decreased [[cardiac index]]), [[JVD]] (jugular vein distention from right sided heart failure and fluid overload), distant heart sounds on auscultation, and equilibration of all the diastolic blood pressures on cardiac catheterization due to the constriction of the pericardium by the fluid.

In such cases of cardiac tamponade, EKG or [[Holter monitor]] will then depict [[electrical alternans]] indicating wobbling of the heart in the fluid filled pericardium, and the [[capillary refill]] might decrease, as well as severe vascular collapse and [[altered mental status]] due to hypoperfusion of body organs by a heart that can not pump out blood effectively.

The diagnostic test for cardiac tamponade, is [[Transesophageal echocardiogram|trans-esophageal echocardiography]] (TEE) although [[Transthoracic echocardiogram|trans-thoracic echocardiography]] (TTE) can also be utilized in cases where there is a high suspicion of [[aortic dissection]] and high blood pressure, or in patients where esophageal probing is not feasible. [[Chest X-ray]] can depict a "water bottle" appearance of the heart in tamponade, although chest X-ray is not specific enough neither is it accurate enough in the acute setting. Of note is the fact that chest X-ray can be entirely normal in acute pericardial effusion/tamponade, so should not be relied upon as the sole diagnostic tool.

==Causes==
===Infectious===
Pericarditis may be caused by [[virus|viral]], [[bacteria]]l, or [[fungus|fungal]] infection. The most common viral pathogen has traditionally been considered to be [[coxsackievirus]] based on studies in children from the 1960s, but recent data suggest that adults are most commonly affected with [[cytomegalovirus]], [[herpesvirus]], and [[HIV]].<ref>{{Cite journal

===Other===
* [[Idiopathic]]:  No identifiable etiology found after routine testing.

* [[Postpericardiotomy syndrome]]: Usually after [[CABG]] surgery

==Diagnosis==
===Laboratory tests===
[[File:AMI bloodtests engl.png|thumb|This diagram depicts the elevation of respective cardiac markers in a myocardial infarction (heart attack). Although this diagram is only for heart attack, elevated values of these markers might be seen in pericarditis.]]

Laboratory values can show increased urea (BUN), or increased blood creatinine in cases of [[uremic pericarditis]]. Generally however, laboratory values are normal, but if there is a concurrent myocardial infarction (heart attack) or great stress to the heart, laboratory values may show increased cardiac markers like [[Troponin]] (I, T), [[CK-MB]], [[Myoglobin]], and [[Lactate dehydrogenase|LDH]]1 (Lactase Dehydrogenase isotype 1). The preferred initial diagnostic testing is the EKG which will show a 12-lead [[electrocardiogram]] with diffuse, non-specific, concave, ST segment-elevations all leads except aVR and V1<ref name=mk /> and PR segment-depression possible in any lead except aVR;<ref name=mk /> sinus tachycardia, and low-voltage QRS complexes can also be seen if there is subsymptomatic levels of pericardial effusion.

Since the mid-19th Century, [[retrospective diagnosis]] of pericarditis has been made upon the finding of adhesions of the pericardium.<ref>{{Cite journal

==Treatment==
The treatment in viral or idiopathic pericarditis is with [[aspirin]],<ref name=mk /> or [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs such as [[ibuprofen]]).<ref name=AFP2007/> [[Colchicine]] maybe be added to the above.<ref name=AFP2007>{{cite journal|last=Tingle|first=LE|coauthors=Molina, D; Calvert, CW|title=Acute pericarditis.|journal=American family physician|date=2007 Nov 15|volume=76|issue=10|pages=1509–14|pmid=18052017}}</ref> Severe cases may require:
* [[pericardiocentesis]] to treat pericardial effusion/tamponade
* [[antibiotic]]s to treat tuberculosis or other bacterial causes.
* [[steroid]]s are used in acute pericarditis but are not favored because they increase the chance of recurrent pericarditis.
* in rare cases, [[surgery]]
* in cases of constrictive pericarditis, [[pericardiectomy]]
