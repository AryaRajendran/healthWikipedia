'''Waldenström's macroglobulinemia''' (WM, also known as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma) is cancer affecting [[B cells]], a type of [[white blood cell]].  The main attributing antibody is [[immunoglobulin M]] (IgM). WM is an "indolent lymphoma," (i.e., one that tends to grow and spread slowly). It is a type of [[lymphoproliferative disease]], which shares clinical characteristics with the indolent [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]]s.<ref name="Cheson">{{cite book | author = Cheson BD | year = 2006 | title = ACP Medicine | chapter = Chronic Lymphoid Leukemias and Plasma Cell Disorders | editor = Dale DD, Federman DD | publisher = WebMD Professional Publishing | location = New York, NY | isbn =  0-9748327-1-5 }}</ref>

The disease, named after the Swedish [[oncologist]] [[Jan G. Waldenström]], was first identified in 1944. As with other lymphomas, the disease is characterized by an uncontrolled increase of [[B-cells]], i.e., white blood cells formed in the [[bone marrow]] and [[lymph nodes]]. The proliferation of B-cells interferes with the production of [[red blood cells]], resulting in [[anemia]]. A unique characteristic of the disease is that the B-cells produce excess amounts of immunoglobulin protein (IgM), thickening the blood, and requiring additional treatment. WM is a rare disease, with only about 1,500 cases per year in the U.S. While the disease is incurable, it is treatable. Because of its indolent nature, many patients are able to lead active lives, and, when treatment is required, may experience years of symptom-free [[remission]].<ref>International Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia Foundation (IWMF). "Living with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia."</ref>

==History and classification==
WM was first described by [[Jan G. Waldenström]] (1906–1996) in 1944 in two patients with bleeding from the nose and mouth, [[anemia]], decreased levels of [[fibrinogen]] in the blood (hypofibrinogenemia), [[lymphadenopathy|swollen lymph nodes]], neoplastic plasma cells in bone marrow, and [[Hyperviscosity syndrome|increased viscosity of the blood]] due to increased levels of a class of heavy proteins called [[macroglobulins]].<ref name="Waldenstrom1944">{{cite journal | doi= 10.1111/j.0954-6820.1944.tb03955.x | author= Waldenstrom J | title=Incipient myelomatosis or "essential" hyperglobulinemia with fibrinognenopenia-a new syndrome? | journal=Acta Med Scand| year=1944 | pages=216–247 | volume=117 | issue= 3–4}}</ref>

For a time, WM was considered to be related to [[multiple myeloma]] due to the presence of [[monoclonal gammopathy]] and infiltration of the bone marrow and other organs by plasmacytoid lymphocytes. The new [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) classification, however, places WM under the category of lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas, itself a subcategory of the indolent (low-grade) non-Hodgkin lymphomas.<ref name="Harris">{{cite journal | author=Harris NL, Jaffe ES, Diebold J, Flandrin G, Muller-Hermelink HK, Vardiman J, Lister TA, Bloomfield CD | title=The World Health Organization classification of neoplastic diseases of the haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues: Report of the Clinical Advisory Committee Meeting, Airlie House, Virginia, November 1997 | journal=Histopathology | year=2000 | pages=69–86 | volume=36 | issue=1  | pmid=10632755 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2559.2000.00895.x}}</ref> In recent years, there have been significant advances in the understanding and treatment of WM.<ref name="cite pmid| 20040909">{{cite pmid| 20040909}}</ref>

==Causes==
Waldenström's macroglobulinemia is characterized by an uncontrolled clonal proliferation of terminally differentiated B lymphocytes.  The underlying etiology is not yet known but a number of risk factors have been identified. There has been an association demonstrated with the locus 6p21.3 on [[chromosome 6]].<ref name="pmid16938573">{{cite journal |author=Schop RF |title=6q deletion discriminates Waldenström macroglobulinemia from IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance |journal=Cancer Genet.

There are [[genetic disorder|genetic factors]], with first-degree relatives shown to have a highly increased risk of also contracting Waldenström's.<ref>{{cite pmid| 18703425}}</ref> There is also evidence to suggest that [[environmental factors]] including exposure to farming, pesticides, wood dust, and organic solvents may influence the development of Waldenström's.<ref>{{cite pmid| 20308603}}</ref>

==Biochemistry==
Although believed to be a sporadic disease, studies have shown increased susceptibility within families, indicating a genetic component.<ref>{{Cite pmid|12720125}}</ref><ref>{{Cite doi|10.1086/507687}}</ref>  A mutation in gene [[MYD88]] has been found to occur frequently in patients.<ref>{{cite pmid|22931316}}</ref>  WM cells show only minimal changes in [[cytogenetic]] and [[gene expression profiling|gene expression studies]].  Their [[miRNA]] signature however differs from their normal counterpart. It is therefore believed that epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in the disease.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1186/1756-8722-3-38}}</ref>  

[[Comparative genomic hybridization]] identified the following [[chromosomal abnormalities]]: deletions of 6q23 and 13q14, and gains of 3q13-q28, 6p and 18q.<ref>{{cite pmid|19362969}}</ref> [[FGFR3]] is overexpressed.<ref>{{cite pmid|21521775}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}

A diagnosis of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia depends on a significant monoclonal IgM spike evident in blood tests and [[malignant]] cells consistent with the disease in [[bone marrow biopsy]] samples.<ref name = workup>Ponce, D. [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/207097-workup Waldenstrom Hypergammaglobulinemia Workup]. Medscape. Retrieved on: 2011-08-14.</ref> Blood tests show the level of IgM in the blood and the presence of proteins, or tumor markers, that are the key symptoms of WM. A bone marrow biopsy provides a sample of bone marrow, usually from the back of the pelvis bone. The sample is extracted through a needle and examined under a microscope. A [[pathologist]] identifies the particular [[lymphocytes]] that indicate WM. [[Flow cytometry]] may be used to examine markers on the cell surface or inside the lymphocytes.<ref name = NCIfacts>National Cancer Institute. [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Sites-Types/WM Waldenström Macroglobulinemia: Questions and Answers]. Retrieved on: 2011-08-14.</ref>

Additional tests such as [[computed tomography]] (CT or CAT) scan may be used to evaluate the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, particularly swelling of the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. A skeletal survey can help distinguish between WM and [[multiple myeloma]].<ref name = NCIfacts/> [[Anemia]] is typically found in 80% of patients with WM. [[Leukopenia]], and [[thrombocytopenia]] may be observed. [[Neutropenia]] may also be found in some patients.<ref name = workup/> 

Chemistry tests include lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, uric acid levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), renal and hepatic function, total protein levels, and an albumin-to-globulin ratio.
The ESR and uric acid level may be elevated.
Creatinine is occasionally elevated and electrolytes are occasionally abnormal. Hypercalcemia is noted in approximately 4% of patients.
The LDH level is frequently elevated, indicating the extent of Waldenström macroglobulinemia–related tissue involvement.
Rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulins, direct antiglobulin test and cold agglutinin titre results can be positive.
Beta-2-microglobulin and C-reactive protein test results are not specific for Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Beta-2-microglobulin is elevated in proportion to tumor mass.
Coagulation abnormalities may be present. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and fibrinogen tests should be performed. Platelet aggregation studies are optional.
Serum protein electrophoresis results indicate evidence of a monoclonal spike but cannot establish the spike as IgM. An M component with beta-to-gamma mobility is highly suggestive of Waldenström macroglobulinemia.
Immunoelectrophoresis and immunofixation studies help identify the type of immunoglobulin, the clonality of the light chain, and the monoclonality and quantitation of the paraprotein.
High-resolution electrophoresis and serum and urine immunofixation are recommended to help identify and characterize the monoclonal IgM paraprotein. 

The light chain of the monoclonal protein is usually the kappa light chain. At times, patients with Waldenström macroglobulinemia may exhibit more than one M protein.
Plasma viscosity must be measured.
Results from characterization studies of urinary immunoglobulins indicate that light chains ([[Bence Jones protein]]), usually of the kappa type, are found in the urine.
Urine collections should be concentrated. 

Bence Jones proteinuria is observed in approximately 40% of patients and exceeds 1 g/d in approximately 3% of patients. Patients with findings of [[peripheral neuropathy]] should have nerve conduction studies and antimyelin associated glycoprotein serology.

==Prognosis==
Current medical treatments result in survival of some longer than 10 years; in part this is because better diagnostic testing means early diagnosis and treatments. Older diagnosis and treatments resulted in published reports of median survival of approximately 5 years from time of diagnosis.<ref name="Cheson" /> Currently, median survival is 6.5 years.<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/207097-overview</ref> In rare instances, WM progresses to [[multiple myeloma]].<ref name="Johansson">{{cite journal | author=Johansson B, Waldenstrom J, Hasselblom S, Mitelman F | title=Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia with the AML/MDS-associated t(1;3)(p36;q21) | journal=Leukemia | year=1995 | pages=1136–8 | volume=9 | issue=7  | pmid=7630185}}</ref>

The International Prognostic Scoring System for Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia (IPSSWM) is a predictive model to characterise long-term outcome.<ref>Morel P, Duhamel A, Gobbi P, Dimopoulos M, Dhodapkar M, McCoy J, et al. International Prognostic Scoring System for Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia. XIth International Myeloma Workshop & IVth International Workshop on Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia 25 30 June 2007 Kos Island, Greece. Haematologica 2007;92(6 suppl 2):1-229.</ref><ref>{{cite pmid| 20447689}}</ref>
According to the model, factors predicting survival (n.b. the study quoted conversely refers to them as "5 adverse covariates") are:
*Age >65 years
*Haemoglobin ≤11.5 g/dL
*Platelet count ≤100×10<sup>9</sup>/L
*B2-microglobulin >3 mg/L
*Serum monoclonal protein concentration >70 g/L
The risk categories are:
*Low: ≤1 adverse variable except age
*Intermediate: 2 adverse characteristics or age >65 years
*High: >2 adverse characteristics
Five-year survival rates for these categories are 87%, 68% and 36% respectively.<ref name="PMID 18641029">{{cite pmid| 18641029}}</ref>

The IPSSWM has been shown to be reliable.<ref>{{Cite pmid|21393333}}</ref>  It is also applicable to patients on a Rituximab-based treatment regimen.<ref name="PMID 18641029"/>
An additional predictive factor is elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).<ref>{{cite pmid| 18931340}}</ref>

==Treatment==
There is no single accepted treatment for WM.<ref>{{cite pmid| 19087134}}</ref> There is marked variation in clinical outcome due to gaps in knowledge of the disease's molecular basis. Objective [[response rate]]s are high (>80%) but complete response rates are low (0-15%).<ref name="cite pmid| 20040909"/>

There are different treatment flowcharts: Treon<ref>{{cite pmid| 19617573}}</ref> and mSMART.<ref>{{cite pmid|20702770}}</ref>

WM patients are at higher risk of developing second cancers than the general population, however it is not yet clear whether treatments are contributory.<ref>{{cite pmid|21525403}}</ref>

===Watchful waiting===
In the absence of symptoms, many clinicians will recommend simply monitoring the patient.<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/207097-treatment</ref>  But on occasion the disease can be fatal, as it was to its best known sufferer, the former French president [[Georges Pompidou]], who died in 1974.  Indeed, in 1991, Waldenström himself raised the question of the need for effective therapy.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Waldenström J | title=To treat or not to treat, this is the real question | journal=Leuk Res | year=1991 | pages=407–8 | volume=15 | issue=6  | pmid=1907339 | doi=10.1016/0145-2126(91)90049-Y}}</ref>

===First-line===
Should treatment be started it should address both the paraprotein level and the lymphocytic B-cells.<ref>{{cite pmid| 18813229}}</ref>  

In 2002, a panel at the International Workshop on Waldenström Macroglobulinemia agreed on criteria for the initiation of therapy. They recommended starting therapy in patients with constitutional symptoms such as recurrent [[fever]], [[night sweats]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] due to [[anemia]], [[weight loss]], progressive symptomatic [[lymphadenopathy]] or [[splenomegaly]], and [[anemia]] due to marrow infiltration. Complications such as hyperviscosity syndrome, symptomatic sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, systemic [[amyloidosis]], [[renal insufficiency]], or symptomatic [[cryoglobulinemia]] were also suggested as indications for therapy.<ref name="Kyel2003">{{cite journal | author=Kyle RA, Treon SP, Alexanian R, Barlogie B, Bjorkholm M, Dhodapkar M, Lister TA, Merlini G, Morel P, Stone M, Branagan AR, Leblond V | title=Prognostic markers and criteria to initiate therapy in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia: consensus panel recommendations from the Second International Workshop on Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia | journal=Semin Oncol | year=2003 | pages=116–20 | volume=30 | issue=2  | pmid=12720119 | doi=10.1053/sonc.2003.50038}}</ref>

When primary or secondary [[drug resistance|resistance]] invariably develops, [[salvage therapy]] is considered.  [[Allogeneic stem cell transplantation]] can induce durable remissions for heavily pre-treated patients.<ref>{{cite pmid|20956626}}</ref>

===Drug pipeline===
As of October 2010, there have been a total of 44 clinical trials on Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, excluding transplantion treatments.  Of these, 11 were performed on previously untreated patients, 14 in patients with relapsed or refractory Waldenstrom's.<ref>{{cite pmid|20795787}}</ref> A database of clinical trials investigating Waldenström's macroglobulinemia is maintained by the [[National Institutes of Health]] in the US.<ref>http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=Waldenstrom</ref>

===Patient stratification===
Patients with [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic variants]] ([[alleles]]) [[FCGR3A]]-48 and -158 were associated with improved categorical responses to Rituximab-based treatments.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08726.x}}</ref>
