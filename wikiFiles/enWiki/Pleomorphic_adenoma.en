'''[[Pleomorphism (cytology)|Pleomorphic]] [[adenoma]]''' is a common benign salivary gland neoplasm characterised by neoplastic proliferation of parenchymatous glandular cells along with myoepithelial components, having a malignant potentiality. It is the most common type of [[salivary gland tumor]] and the most common tumor of the [[parotid gland]]. It derives its name from the architectural pleomorphism (variable appearance) seen by light microscopy. It is also known as "Mixed tumor, [[salivary gland]] type", which describes its pleomorphic appearance as opposed to its dual origin from epithelial and myoepithelial elements.

== Clinical Presentation ==
The tumor is usually solitary and presents as a slow growing, painless, firm single nodular mass. Isolated nodules are generally outgrowths of the main nodule rather than a multinodular presentation. It is usually mobile unless found in the palate and can cause [[atrophy]] of the [[mandibular ramus]] when located in the parotid gland. When found in the parotid tail, it may present as an eversion of the ear lobe. Though it is classified as a [[benign tumor]], pleomorphic adenomas have the capacity to grow to large proportions and may undergo malignant transformation, to form [[carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma]], a risk that increases with time. Although  it is "benign" the tumor is [[aneuploid]], it can recur after resection, it invades normal adjacent tissue and distant metastases have been reported after long (+10 years) time intervals.

== Histology ==
Histologically, it is highly variable in appearance, even within individual tumors. Classically it is biphasic and is characterized by an admixture of polygonal [[epithelial]] and spindle-shaped [[myoepithelial]] elements in a variable background [[stromal cell|stroma]] that may be mucoid, myxoid, cartilaginous or hyaline. Epithelial elements may be arranged in duct-like structures, sheets, clumps and/or interlacing strands and consist of polygonal, spindle or stellate-shaped cells (hence pleiomorphism). Areas of squamous metaplasia and epithelial pearls may be present. The tumor is not enveloped, but it is surrounded by a fibrous pseudocapsule of varying thickness. The tumor extends through normal glandular parenchyma in the form of finger-like pseudopodia, but this is not a sign of malignant transformation.

The tumor often displays characteristic chromosomal translocations between chromosomes #3 and #8. This causes the [[PLAG]] gene to be juxtaposed to the gene for [[beta catenin]]. This activates the catenin pathway and leads to inappropriate cell division.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of salivary gland tumors utilize both tissue sampling and radiographic studies. Tissue sampling procedures include [[fine needle aspiration]] (FNA) and core needle biopsy (bigger needle comparing to FNA). Both of these procedures can be done in an outpatient setting.  Diagnostic imaging techniques for salivary gland tumors include [[ultrasound]], [[computer tomography]] (CT) and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI).

Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA), operated in experienced hands, can determine whether the tumor is malignant in nature with [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] around 90%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cohen EG, Patel SG, Lin O, ''et al.'' |title=Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of salivary gland lesions in a selected patient population |journal=Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg |volume=130 |issue=6 |pages=773–8 |year=2004 |month=Jun |pmid=15210562 |doi=10.1001/archotol.130.6.773 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Batsakis JG, Sneige N, el-Naggar AK |title=Fine-needle aspiration of salivary glands: its utility and tissue effects |journal=Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol |volume=101 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=185–8 |year=1992 |month=Feb |pmid=1739267 |doi= |url=}}</ref> FNA can also distinguish primary salivary tumor from metastatic disease. 

Core needle biopsy can also be done in outpatient setting. It is more invasive but is more accurate compared to FNA with diagnostic [[accuracy]] greater than 97%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wan YL, Chan SC, Chen YL, ''et al.'' |title=Ultrasonography-guided core-needle biopsy of parotid gland masses |journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=1608–12 |year=2004 |month=Oct |pmid=15502149 |doi= |url=http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15502149}}</ref> Furthermore, core needle biopsy allows more accurate histological typing of the tumor. 

In terms of imaging studies, ultrasound can determine and characterize superficial parotid tumors. Certain types of salivary gland tumors have certain sonographic characteristics on ultrasound.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Białek EJ, Jakubowski W, Karpińska G |title=Role of ultrasonography in diagnosis and differentiation of pleomorphic adenomas: work in progress |journal=Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg |volume=129 |issue=9 |pages=929–33 |year=2003 |month=Sep |pmid=12975263 |doi=10.1001/archotol.129.9.929 |url=}}</ref> Ultrasound is also frequently used to guide FNA or core needle biopsy.

CT allows direct, bilateral visualization of the salivary gland tumor and provides information about overall dimension and tissue invasion. CT is excellent for demonstrating bony invasion. MRI provides superior soft tissue delineation such as [[perineural invasion]] when compared to CT only.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Koyuncu M, Seşen T, Akan H, ''et al.'' |title=Comparison of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of parotid tumors |journal=Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg |volume=129 |issue=6 |pages=726–32 |year=2003 |month=Dec |pmid=14663442 |doi=10.1016/j.otohns.2003.07.009 |url=}}</ref>

== Treatment ==

Overall, the mainstay of the treatment for salivary gland tumor is surgical resection. Needle biopsy is highly recommended prior to surgery to confirm the diagnosis. More detailed surgical technique and the support for additional [[adjuvant]] radiotherapy depends on whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

Surgical treatment of parotid gland tumors is sometimes difficult, partly because of the anatomical relationship of the facial nerve and the parotid lodge, but also through the increased potential for postoperative relapse. Thus, detection of early stages of a tumor of the parotid gland is extremely important in terms of prognosis after surgery.<ref name="revistaOMF">

Generally, benign tumors of the parotid gland are treated with superficial(Patey's operation) or total parotidectomy with the latter being the more commonly practiced due to high incidence of recurrence.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stennert E, Guntinas-Lichius O, Klussmann JP, Arnold G |title=Histopathology of pleomorphic adenoma in the parotid gland: a prospective unselected series of 100 cases |journal=Laryngoscope |volume=111 |issue=12 |pages=2195–200 |year=2001 |month=Dec |pmid=11802025 |doi= 10.1097/00005537-200112000-00024|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0023-852X&volume=111&issue=12&spage=2195}}</ref>  The [[facial nerve]] should be preserved whenever possible. The benign tumors of the [[submandibular gland]] is treated by simple excision with preservation of mandibular branch of the [[trigeminal nerve]], the [[hypoglossal nerve]], and the [[lingual nerve]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leonetti JP, Marzo SJ, Petruzzelli GJ, Herr B |title=Recurrent pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland |journal=Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg |volume=133 |issue=3 |pages=319–22 |year=2005 |month=Sep |pmid=16143173 |doi=10.1016/j.otohns.2005.04.008 |url=}}</ref> Other benign tumors of minor salivary glands are treated similarly.

Malignant salivary tumors usually require wide local resection of the primary tumor. However, if complete resection cannot be achieved, adjuvant radiotherapy should be added to improve local control.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ganly I, Patel SG, Coleman M, Ghossein R, Carlson D, Shah JP |title=Malignant minor salivary gland tumors of the larynx |journal=Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. |volume=132 |issue=7 |pages=767–70 |year=2006 |month=Jul |pmid=16847187 |doi=10.1001/archotol.132.7.767 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Terhaard CH, Lubsen H, Rasch CR, ''et al.'' |title=The role of radiotherapy in the treatment of malignant salivary gland tumors |journal=Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=103–11 |year=2005 |month=Jan |pmid=15629600 |doi=10.1016/j.ijrobp.2004.03.018 |url=}}</ref> This surgical treatment has many sequellae such as cranial nerve damage, [[Frey's syndrome]], cosmetic problems, etc.

Usually about 44% of the patients have a complete histologic removal of the tumor and this refers to the most significant survival rate.

But the locoregional control rate for the carcinoma pleomorphic adenoma is only 66% in the 5-year duration of the recovery time making the recurrence of the disease invariably fatal, and even the 44% of the disease-related specific cases report to high rate of mortality accounting to 87%.<ref>Pleomorphic adenoma, Dr. Akif, consultant advisor for [http://healthsignal.net/?p=767 Health Signal]</ref>
