'''Cancer screening''' aims to detect [[cancer]] before symptoms appear.<ref name=NIH>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/screening/overview/Patient |title=What Is Cancer Screening? |work=National Cancer Institute |accessdate=}}</ref> This may involve [[blood test]]s, [[urine]] tests, other tests, or [[medical imaging]].<ref name=NIH/> The benefits of  screening in terms of cancer prevention, early detection and subsequent treatment must be weighed against any harms. 

''[[Universal screening]]'', ''mass screening'' or ''population screening'' involves screening everyone, usually within a specific age group.<ref name=Wilson>Wilson JMG, Jungner G. (1968) [http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/4/07-050112BP.pdf Principles and practice of screening for disease.] Geneva:[[World Health Organization]].  Public Health Papers, #34.</ref>  ''Selective screening'' identifies people who are known to be at higher risk of developing cancer, such as people with a family history of cancer.<ref name=Wilson />

Screening can lead to false positive results and subsequent invasive procedures.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Croswell |first1=Jennifer Miller |last2=Kramer |first2=Barnett S. |last3=Kreimer |first3=Aimee R. |last4=Prorok |first4=Phil C. |last5=Xu |first5=Jian-Lun |last6=Baker |first6=Stuart G. |last7=Fagerstrom |first7=Richard |last8=Riley |first8=Thomas L. |last9=Clapp |first9=Jonathan D. |title=Cumulative Incidence of False-Positive Results in Repeated, Multimodal Cancer Screening |journal=The Annals of Family Medicine |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=212–22 |year=2009 |pmid=19433838 |pmc=2682972 |doi=10.1370/afm.942}}</ref> Screening can also lead to false negative results, where an existing cancer is missed. Controversy arises when it is not clear if the benefits of screening outweigh the risks of the screening procedure itself, and any follow-up diagnostic tests and treatments.  

Screening tests must be effective, safe, well-tolerated with acceptably low rates of [[Type I and type II errors|false positive]] and [[Type I and type II errors|false negative results]]. If signs of cancer are detected, more definitive and invasive follow-up tests are performed to reach a diagnosis. Screening for cancer can lead to cancer prevention and earlier diagnosis. Early diagnosis may lead to higher rates of successful treatment and extended life.  However, it may also falsely appear to increase the time to death through [[lead time bias]] or [[length time bias]].

==Risks and benefits==

Screening for cancer is controversial in cases when it is not yet known if the test actually saves lives. Screening can lead to substantial false positive result and subsequent invasive procedures.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Croswell JM, Kramer BS, Kreimer AR, ''et al.'' |title=Cumulative incidence of false-positive results in repeated, multimodal cancer screening |journal=[[Ann Fam Med]] |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=212–22 |year=2009 |pmid=19433838 |doi=10.1370/afm.942 |url= |pmc=2682972}}</ref> The controversy arises when it is not clear if the benefits of screening outweigh the risks of follow-up diagnostic tests and cancer treatments.  Cancer screening is not indicated unless [[life expectancy]] is greater than five years and the benefit is uncertain over the age of 70.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Spalding MC, Sebesta SC |title=Geriatric screening and preventive care |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=206–15 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18697503 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Breast cancer===
{{Main|Breast cancer screening}}

There is general agreement in the scientific community that breast screening reduces mortality from the disease.<ref name="CD001877">{{cite journal |last1=Gøtzsche |first1=Peter C |last2=Nielsen |first2=Margrethe |title=Screening for breast cancer with mammography |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=1 |pages=CD001877 |year=2011 |pmid=21249649 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001877.pub4}}</ref> There is some controversy however about the number of lives saved by breast screening and the number of cancers diagnosed and treated that would not have caused any health problems in the participants' lifetime, sometimes known as over-diagnosis and over-treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Duffy |first1=S. W. |last2=Tabar |first2=L. |last3=Olsen |first3=A. H. |last4=Vitak |first4=B. |last5=Allgood |first5=P. C. |last6=Chen |first6=T. H. H. |last7=Yen |first7=A. M. F. |last8=Smith |first8=R.

Since doctors cannot usually distinguish which DCIS will go on to invasive cancer, most are treated. This is where over-treatment can arise.   

The [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) recommends population [[screening mammography]] once for every two years for all women aged 50–74, with decisions about screening younger and older women being determined by consideration of the individual's risk factors and the benefits and harms of screening.   They do not recommend either [[breast self-examination]] or [[clinical breast examination]].<ref name=USPTFBr09>{{cite web |url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsbrca.htm |title=Screening for Breast Cancer  |date=December 2009 |accessdate=December 13, 2012 |work=[[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]]}}</ref>  Their recommendation is similar to the [[World Health Organization]]'s, and less aggressive than some American organizations. A 2011 [[Cochrane review]] came to slightly different conclusions with respect to breast cancer screening stating that routine mammography may do more harm than good.<ref name="CD001877"/>

===Cervical cancer===
[[File:Ca in situ, cervix.jpg|thumb|Microscope image of the cervical gland showing an area of high grade [[epithelial dysplasia]].]]

{{Main|Cervical screening}}

Cervical screening is highly effective at detecting and preventing [[cervical cancer]]. 

The [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) strongly recommends [[cervical cancer]] screening in American women who are [[sexually active]] and have a [[cervix]] at least until the age of 65, usually every three years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspscerv.htm |title=Screening for Cervical Cancer |date=March 2012|work=[[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]]}}</ref>  Their recommendation is typical of professional organizations and other government agencies in the US and Canada.

===Bowel cancer===
[[File:SB polyp.jpg|thumb|A [[bowel polyp]] that can be identified by [[sigmoidoscopy]]. Polyps can in some cases be cancer precursors.]]
The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for [[colorectal cancer]] using [[fecal occult blood]] testing, [[sigmoidoscopy]], or [[colonoscopy]], in adults, beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years. For people over 75 or those with a life expectancy of less than 10&nbsp;years screening is not recommended. A new method for colorectal cancer screening is the [[M2-PK Test]],<ref>C. Tonus, M. Sellinger u. a.: Faecal pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 for colorectal cancer screening: A meta-analysis. In: World journal of gastroenterology : WJG. Band 18, Nummer 30, August 2012, S. 4004–4011, ISSN 1007-9327. doi:10.3748/wjg.v18.i30.4004. PMID 22912551.

===Prostate cancer===

{{Main|Prostate cancer screening}}
When screening for [[prostate cancer]], the [[Prostate specific antigen|PSA]] test may detect small cancers that would never become life threatening, but once detected will lead to treatment. This situation, called overdiagnosis, puts men at risk for complications from unnecessary treatment such as surgery or radiation. Follow up procedures used to diagnose prostate cancer ([[prostate biopsy]]) may cause side effects, including bleeding and infection. Prostate cancer treatment may cause [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]] (inability to control urine flow) and [[erectile dysfunction]] (erections inadequate for intercourse).{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===Lung Cancer===
{{Main|Lung cancer screening}}

According to the [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF), there is  insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for [[lung cancer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspslung.htm |title=Lung Cancer Screening |year=2004 |work=[[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]]}}</ref>

Recent research suggests that screening heavy smokers may be effective.

According to the [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF), there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for prostate cancer in men under 75.<ref name=USPTFPr08>{{cite web |url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsprca.htm |title=Screening for Prostate Cancer |year=2008 |work=[[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]]}}</ref> Routine screening is not recommended for prostate cancer in men over 75.<ref name=USPTFPr08/>  Most North American medical groups recommend individualized decisions about screening, taking into consideration the risks, benefits, and the patients' personal preferences.

Several factors are considered to determine whether the benefits of screening outweigh the risks and the costs of screening.<ref name=NIH/> These factors include:

==Determining if a screening is useful==
*Possible harms from the screening test: Some types of screening tests, such as [[X-ray images]], expose the body to potentially harmful [[ionizing radiation]]. There is a small chance that the radiation in the test could cause a new cancer in a healthy person. [[Screening mammography]], used to detect breast cancer, is not recommended to men or to young women because they are more likely to be harmed by the test than to benefit from it. Other tests, such as a skin check for skin cancer, have no significant risk of harm to the patient. A test that has high potential harms is only recommended when the benefits are also high.
*The likelihood of the test correctly identifying cancer: If the test is not ''[[sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]'', then it may miss cancers. If the test is not ''[[sensitivity and specificity|specific]]'', then it may wrongly indicate cancer in a healthy person. All cancer screening tests produce both [[false positive]]s and [[false negative]]s, and most produce more false positives. Experts consider the rate of errors when making recommendations about which test, if any, to use. A test may work better in some populations than others. The [[positive predictive value]] is a calculation of the likelihood that a positive test result actually represents cancer in a given individual, based on the results of people with similar risk factors.
*The likelihood of cancer being present: Screening is not normally useful for rare cancers. It is rarely done for young people, since cancer is largely a disease found in people over the age of 50. Countries often focus their screening recommendations on the major forms of treatable cancer found in their population. For example, the United States recommends universal screening for [[colon cancer]], which is common in the US, but not for [[stomach cancer]], which is less common; by contrast, Japan recommends screening for stomach cancer, but not colon cancer, which is rarer in Japan. Screening recommendations depend on the individual's risk, with high-risk people receiving earlier and more frequent screening than low-risk people.
*Possible harms from follow-up procedures: If the screening test is positive, further diagnostic testing is normally done, such as a [[biopsy]] of the tissue. If the test produces many false positives, then many people will undergo needless medical procedures, some of which may be dangerous.
*Whether suitable treatment is available and appropriate: Screening is discouraged if no effective treatment is available.<ref name=Wilson /> When effective and suitable treatment is not available, then diagnosis of a fatal disease produces significant mental and emotional harms. For example, routine screening for cancer is typically not appropriate in a very [[frailty syndrome|frail elderly]] person, because the treatment for any cancer that is detected might kill the patient.
*Whether early detection improves treatment outcomes: Even when treatment is available, sometimes early detection does not improve the outcome. If the treatment result is the same as if the screening had not been done, then the only screening program does is increase the length of time the person lived with the knowledge that he had cancer. This phenomenon is called [[lead-time bias]]. A useful screening program reduces the number of [[years of potential life lost]] (longer lives) and [[disability-adjusted life year]]s lost (longer healthy lives).
*Whether the cancer will ever need treatment: Diagnosis of a cancer in a person who will never be harmed by the cancer is called [[overdiagnosis]]. Overdiagnosis is most common among older people with slow-growing cancers. Concerns about overdiagnosis are common for breast and prostate cancer.
*Whether the test is acceptable to the patients:If a screening test is too burdensome, such as requiring too much time, too much pain, or culturally unacceptable behaviors, then people will refuse to participate.<ref name=Wilson />
*Cost of the test: Some expert bodies, such as the [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]], completely ignore the question of money. Most, however, include a [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] that, all else being equal, favors less expensive tests over more expensive tests, and attempt to balance the cost of the screening program against the [[opportunity cost|benefits of using those funds for other health programs]]. These analyses usually include the total cost of the screening program to the healthcare system, such as ordering the test, performing the test, reporting the results, and biopsies for suspicious results, but not usually the costs to the individual, such as for time taken away from employment.
*The extent to which a cancer is treatable: if a person has a low life expectancy or otherwise is in the end stages of a chronic condition, then such a patient may have a better life by ignoring the cancer even if one were found. If the diagnosis of cancer would not result in a change in care then cancer screening would not likely result in a positive outcome. Overdiagnosis in this case occurs, for example, in patients with [[end-stage renal disease]] and organizations recommend against cancer screening for such patients.<ref name="ASNfive">{{Citation |author1 = American Society of Nephrology |author1-link = American Society of Nephrology |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Society of Nephrology]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Neph.pdf |accessdate = August 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name="ESRDcancerfinancal">{{cite doi|10.1001/archinte.1996.00440110117016}}</ref>

==Whole body imaging==
Use of [[medical imaging]] to search for cancer in people without clear symptoms is similarly marred with problems. There is a significant risk of detection of what has been recently called an ''[[incidentaloma]]'' - a benign lesion that may be interpreted as a malignancy and be subjected to potentially dangerous investigations.
