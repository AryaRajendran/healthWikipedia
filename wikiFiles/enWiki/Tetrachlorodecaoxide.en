'''Tetrachlorodecaoxide''' (TCDO) is a [[chlorite]] containing drug used for the dressing of [[wounds]], [[immunomodulator|immunomodulation]] and as [[radiation]] protective agent. It is the active principle of the drug Oxoferin  made by Brookes Pharmaceutical Laboratories (Pakistan) Ltd under license from Oxo Chemie GmbH. In May 2002, Oxo Chemie was acquired by Dimethaid Research Inc, (now Nuvo Research Inc).

==Mode of action==
Several chlorooxygen compounds, [[hydrogen peroxide]] and reducing molecules in the presence of [[Chelation|chelated]] iron ([[Fenton systems]]) are oxidants of biological relevance. [[Hemoglobin]] of the [[red cells]] has such iron and activates TCDO.  It is available as sterile solution for topical use in 1:55 [[:wikt:dilution|dilution]]. Due to its oxidizing properties, TCDO can destroy most [[pathogens]] although it is not regarded as [[antibiotic]]. But the main reason for its use for dressing of wounds is not its [[bactericidal]] activity. This drug is regarded as [[immunomodulator|immunomodulating]], that is, it acts by stimulating the immune system of the body. Tetrachlorodecaoxide combines with the [[haem]] part of [[hemoglobin]], [[myoglobin]] and [[peroxidase]], forming a TCDO-haemo complex. This in turn activates the [[macrophages]] and accelerates the process of [[phagocytosis]] which engulfs most of the [[pathogens]] and cell debris present on the surface of the wound, thus cleaning the wound surface and helping in the regenerative process. Tetrachlorodecaoxide is also [[mitogen]]ic and [[chemotactic]]. The mitogenic impulse gives rise to two factors, MDGF([[Macrophage derived growth factor]]) and WAF ([[Wound angiogenesis factor]]). The MDGF deposits [[fibroblasts]] and synthesizes [[collagen]] fibers which fills the gap in the wounds, the WAF helps in the formation of new capillaries which further enhances the [[healing]] process. The chemotactic impulse acts on the [[myocyte]] (muscle cell) and causes it to contract, thereby bringing the wound edges closer and reducing the wound surface. Simultaneous influence of all these factors accelerate the wound healing with minimal scarring.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080719154820/http://www.brookespharma.com/brands_oxoferin_main.htm Brookes Pharmaceutical Laboratories (Pakistan) Limited] (archived from [http://www.brookespharma.com/brands_oxoferin_main.htm the original] on 2008-07-19)</ref>

WF 10 [Immunokine, Macrokine] is a 1 : 10 dilution of tetrachlorodecaoxide (TCDO) formulated for [[intravenous injection]]. It was developed by Oxo Chemie in [[Switzerland]] as an adjunctive therapy to combination [[antiretroviral]] and [[opportunistic infection]] prophylaxis regimens in [[AIDS]] patients. WF 10 specifically targets [[macrophages]]. WF10 potentially modulates disease-related up-regulation of immune responses both in vitro and in vivo. Thus immune response is influenced in a way that inappropriate inflammatory reactions are downregulated.<ref>Arzneimittelforschung. 2001;51(7):554-62.

PMID 11505786</ref> WF10 is currently being studied in the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] for treatment of late-stage [[HIV]] disease, as well as recurrent [[prostate cancer]], late post-radiation cystitis, [[autoimmune disease]] and chronic active [[hepatitis C]] disease.<ref>McGrath MS, Kahn JO, Herndier BG.

Oxo Chemie has worldwide [[patent]] rights to WF 10 and Dimethaid Research has an exclusive license for marketing and distribution in [[Canada]]. WF 10 is approved for use in [[Thailand]] under the name IMMUNOKINE in patients with postradiation chronic inflammatory disease including [[cystitis]], [[proctitis]] and [[mucositis]].<ref>WF 10: Macrokine, TCDO, Tetrachlorodecaoxide.

Tetrachlorodecaoxide produces [[methaemoglobin]] even if diluted 500 fold, and leads to additional alterations if added in high concentrations to [[red cells]].<ref>Klin Wochenschr. 1989 Jan 4;67(1):20-5.
