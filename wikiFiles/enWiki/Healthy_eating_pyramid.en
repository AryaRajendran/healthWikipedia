The '''healthy eating pyramid''' is a [[nutrition]] guide developed by the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], suggesting quantities of each food category that a human should eat each day. The healthy eating pyramid is intended to provide a superior eating guide than the widespread [[food guide pyramid]] created by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]].

The new pyramid aims to include more recent research in dietary health not present in the USDA's 1992 guide. The original USDA pyramid has been criticized for not differentiating between [[refined grains]] and [[whole grain]]s, between [[saturated fat]]s and [[unsaturated fat]]s, and for not placing enough emphasis on [[exercise]] and [[weight control]]. It also was developed by the Department of ''Agriculture'', not the Department of ''Health'' and Human Services.  

==Food groups==

In general terms, the healthy eating pyramid recommends the following intake of different food groups each day, although exact amounts of calorie intake depends on sex, age, and lifestyle:
* Daily exercise to expend calories for weight control
* At most meals, [[whole grain]] foods including [[oatmeal]], [[whole-wheat bread]], and [[brown rice]]; 1 piece or {{convert|4|oz|g|-1}}.
* [[vegetable oil|Plant oil]]s, including [[olive oil]], [[canola oil]], [[soybean oil]], [[corn oil]], and [[sunflower seed oil]]; {{convert|2|oz|g|-1}} per day
* [[Vegetable]]s, in abundance 3 or more each day; each serving = {{convert|6|oz|g|-1}}.
* 2–3 servings of [[fruit]]s; each serving = 1 piece of fruit or {{convert|4|oz|g|-1}}.
* 1–3 servings of [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], or [[legume]]s; each serving = {{convert|2|oz|g|-1}}.
* 1–2 servings of [[dairy]] or [[calcium]] supplement; each serving = {{convert|8|oz|g|-1}} non fat or {{convert|4|oz|g|-1}} of whole.
* 1–2 servings of [[poultry]], [[fish]], or [[egg (food)|eggs]]; each serving = {{convert|4|oz|g|-1}} or 1 egg.
* Sparing use of [[white rice]], [[white bread]], [[potato]]es, [[pasta]] and [[sweets]];
* Sparing use of [[red meat]] and [[butter]].
