'''Retinal dysplasia''' is an [[eye disease]] affecting the [[retina]] of animals and, less commonly, humans.  It is usually a nonprogressive disease and can be caused by [[virus|viral]] infections, drugs, [[vitamin A]] deficiency, or [[genetic defect]]s.  Retinal dysplasia is characterized by folds or [[rosette]]s (round clumps) of the retinal tissue.

==Retinal dysplasia in dogs==
Most cases of retinal dysplasia in [[dog]]s are [[heredity|hereditary]].  It can involve one or both retinas.  Retinal dysplasia can be focal, multifocal, geographic, or accompanied by [[retinal detachment]].  Focal and multifocal retinal dysplasia appears as streaks and dots in the central retina.  Geographic retinal dysplasia appears as an irregular or horseshoe-shaped area of mixed hyper or hyporeflectivity in the central retina.  Retinal detachment occurs with complete retinal dysplasia, and is accompanied by blindness in that eye.  [[Cataract]]s or [[glaucoma]] can also occur secondary to retinal dysplasia.  Other causes of retinal dysplasia in dogs include infection with [[infectious canine hepatitis|canine adenovirus]] or [[canine herpesvirus]], or [[radiation]] of the eye in newborns.

===Commonly affected breeds===
*[[Bedlington Terrier]] - complete retinal dysplasia.
*[[Sealyham Terrier]] - complete retinal dysplasia.
*[[Rottweiler]] - focal or multifocal.
*[[English Springer Spaniel]] - focal, multifocal, or geographic.
*[[American Cocker Spaniel]] - focal or multifocal.
*[[Beagle]] - focal or multifocal.
*[[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel]] - retinal folds, geographic, or retinal detachment.
*[[Labrador Retriever]] - focal, multifocal, geographic, or complete retinal dysplasia.  It can also be seen in combination with a congenital skeletal disorder.
*[[Australian Shepherd]] - retinal dysplasia occurs with other eye disorders, such as an oval [[pupil]], [[microcornea]] (small cornea), cataracts, and retinal detachment.<ref name=Gelatt_1999>{{cite book|author=Gelatt, Kirk N.

==Retinal dysplasia in other animals==
*[[Cat]]s - Retinal dysplasia occurs [[in utero]] or in newborns infected with [[feline leukemia virus]] or [[feline panleukopenia]], which cause [[necrosis]] and disorganization of the retina.  It appears as folds and rosettes.
*[[Cattle]] - Retinal dysplasia occurs in utero through infection with [[flaviviridae|bovine viral diarrhea]].  It is also inherited in [[Shorthorn]]s and [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]]s.  Both forms often cause retinal detachment.
*[[Sheep]] - Retinal dysplasia occurs by in utero infection with [[bluetongue disease]].
*[[Horse]]s - Retinal dysplasia is bilateral, not inherited, and appears as multifocal or geographic disease.  It is usually accompanied by other eye problems.
