'''Monomelic amyotrophy''' (MMA), also known as '''Hirayama disease''', '''Sobue disease''', '''juvenile non-progressive amyotrophy''' and '''juvenile asymmetric segmental spinal muscular atrophy''' (JASSMA) — is an untreatable, focal [[motor neuron disease]] that primarily affects young (15–25 year old) males in [[India]] and [[Japan]].  MMA is marked by insidious onset of muscular [[atrophy]], which stabilizes at a plateau after two to five years from which it neither improves nor worsens.  There is no pain or sensory loss associated with MMA.  Unlike other lower [[motor neuron disease]]s, MMA is not believed to be [[hereditary]] and [[fasciculation]]s (involuntary muscle twitches) are rare.  

[[Electromyography|EMG]] tests reveal loss of the nerve supply, or denervation, in the affected limb without ''conduction block'' (nerve blockage restricted to a small segment of the nerve).  Increased [[sweating]], coldness and [[cyanosis]] have been reported for a few patients, indicating involvement of the [[sympathetic nervous system]].

While MMA will cause weakness and/or wasting in only one limb, [[Electromyography|EMG]] and [[Nerve conduction velocity|NCV]] tests often show signs of [[reinnervation]] in the unaffected limbs.

==Treatment==
There is no cure for MMA. Treatment consists of muscle strengthening exercises and training in hand coordination.

==Prognosis==
The symptoms of MMA usually progress slowly for one to two years before reaching a plateau, and then remain stable for many years. Disability is generally slight. Rarely, the weakness progresses to the opposite limb. There is also a slowly progressive variant of MMA known as [[O'Sullivan-McLeod syndrome]], which only affects the small muscles of the hand and forearm and has a slowly progressive course.

==Epidemiology==
MMA occurs in males between the ages of 15 and 25. Onset and progression are slow. MMA is seen most frequently in Asia, particularly in Japan and India; it is much less common in North America.
