'''Thygeson's superficial punctate keratopathy''' ('''TSPK'''; also ''Thygeson Superficial Punctate Keratitis'') is a [[eye disease|disease of the eye]]s. The causes of TSPK are not currently known, but details of the disease were first published in the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] in 1950 by Phillips Thygeson - after whom it is named.<ref>Thygeson P. ''Superficial punctate keratitis.'' J Am Med Assoc 1950;144:1544-9. PMID 14794375.</ref>

== Symptoms ==
A patient with TSPK may complain of blurred [[Visual perception|vision]], dry eyes, a sensation of having a foreign body stuck in the eye, photophobia (sensitivity to bright light), burning sensations and watery eyes. On inspection with a [[slit lamp]], tiny lumps can be found on the [[cornea]] of the eye. These lumps can be more easily seen after applying [[fluorescein]] or rose bengal dye eye-drops. The lumps appear to be randomly positioned on the cornea and they may appear and disappear over a period of time (with or without treatment).

TSPK may affect one or both eyes. When both eyes are affected, the tiny lumps found on the cornea may differ in number between eyes. The severity of the [[symptom]]s often vary during the course of the disease. The disease may appear to go into remission, only to later reappear after months or years.

== Causes ==
The causes of TSPK are not currently known.

== Treatment ==
There are a number of different treatments to deal with TSPK. Symptoms may disappear if untreated, but treatment may decrease both the healing time and the chances of [[Remission (medicine)|remission]].

* PRK laser eye surgery may cure this disease (NOTE: A full clinical study has not been done, but a case study of one person was reported in 2002 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12394540 PRK-pTK as a treatment]).
* Artificial tear eye-drops or ointments may be a suitable treatment for mild cases.
* Low-dosage [[steroid]]al eye-drops, such as [[prednisone]], [[fluorometholone]], [[loteprednol]] (Lotemax 0.5%) or [[rimexolone]]. Steroidal drops should be used with caution<ref name="pmid10571306">{{cite journal |author=Tanzer DJ, Smith RE |title=Superficial punctate keratitis of thygeson: the longest course on record? |journal=Cornea |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=729–30 |year=1999 |pmid=10571306 |doi= 10.1097/00003226-199911000-00017|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0277-3740&volume=18&issue=6&spage=729}}</ref> and the eye pressure should be regularly checked during treatment.
* Soft [[contact lens]]es.
* [[Cyclosporin]] is an experimental treatment for TSPK. It is usually used during [[Organ transplant|transplant]]s as it reduces the [[immune system]] response. 
* [[Tacrolimus]] (Protopic 0.03% ointment) is also an experimental treatment.
