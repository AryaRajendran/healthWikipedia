The '''Dutch hypothesis''' provides one of several [[biologically plausible]] explanations for the [[pathogenesis]] of [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)]], a progressive disease known to be [[Etiology (medicine)|aetiologically]] linked to environmental insults such as [[tobacco smoke]].<ref name=Tam2012>{{cite journal |author=Tam A, Sin DD |title=Pathobiologic mechanisms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |journal=Med.

More recent [[molecular biology]] research suggests that the pathogenesis of asthma and COPD may share overlapping pathways involving innate biological susceptibility, coupled with environmental factors which can trigger the different diseases. [[Genetic association]] studies that have uncovered the same [[polymorphism]]s in people with asthma and COPD provide support for the notion that the two conditions share some biological characteristics; implicated genes include ''[[ADAM33]]'', ''[[CCL5]]'' and ''[[Interleukin 17|IL17F]]''.<ref name=Hizawa2009>{{cite journal|last=Hizawa|first=N|title=Genetic backgrounds of asthma and COPD.|journal=Allergology international: official journal of the Japanese Society of Allergology|date=September 2009|volume=58|issue=3|pages=315–22|pmid=19628974|url=http://ai.jsaweb.jp/fulltext/058030315/058030315_index.html#a5|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>
