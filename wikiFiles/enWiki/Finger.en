A '''finger''' is a limb of the human body and a type of [[digit (anatomy)|digit]], an organ of [[wikt:manipulate|manipulation]] and [[Wikt:sensation|sensation]] found in the [[hand]]s of [[human]]s and other [[primate]]s.<ref name="Cha1998">[[#Cha1998|Chambers 1998 page 603]]</ref><ref name="OxfIll">[[#OxfIll|Oxford Illustrated pages 311,380]]</ref>
Normally humans have five digits, the bones of whom are termed phalanges,<ref name="OxfIll"/> on each hand (exceptions are [[polydactyly]], [[oligodactyly]] and digit loss). The first digit is the [[thumb]], followed by [[index finger]], [[middle finger]], [[ring finger]], and [[little finger]] or pinky. Some other languages use the same generic term for all five digits of a hand.

==Etymology==
English dictionaries describe finger as meaning either one of the five digits including the thumb, or one of the four excluding the thumb (in which case they are numbered from 1 to 4 starting with the index finger closest to the thumb).<ref name="Cha1998"/><ref name="OxfIll"/><ref>[[#Oxford|Oxford Advanced page 326]]</ref> Linguistically, it appears that the original sense was to include the thumb as a finger: the word is derived from ''[[Linguistic reconstruction|*]]‍penkwe-ros''{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} (also rendered as ''*penqrós''){{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} which was, in the inferred [[Proto-Indo-European language]], a suffixed form of ''*penkwe'' (or ''*penqe''), "five", which has{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} given rise to many [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]-family words (tens of them defined in English dictionaries) that involve or flow from concepts of fiveness.  In English only the digits on the hand are known as fingers.  However, in some languages the translated version of fingers can mean either the digits on the hand or feet.  In English a digit on a foot has the distinct name of [[toe]].

==Human anatomy==

===Skeleton===
[[Image:Scheme human hand bones-en.svg|thumb|Illustration depicting the bones of the human hand]]
The [[thumb]] (connected to the [[trapezium (bone)|trapezium]]) is located on one of the sides, parallel to the arm.

The palm has five bones known as metacarpal bones, one to each of the 5 digits. Human hands contain fourteen digital bones, also called phalanges, or [[phalanx bones]]: two in the thumb (the thumb has no middle phalanx) and three in each of the four fingers. These are the distal phalanx, carrying the nail, the middle phalanx, and the proximal phalanx.

[[Sesamoid bone]]s are small [[ossified]] nodes embedded in the tendons to provide extra leverage and reduce pressure on the underlying tissue. Many exist around the palm at the bases of the digits; the exact number varies between different people.

The [[Joint|articulations]] are: [[interphalangeal articulations of hand|interphalangeal articulations]] between phalangeal bones, and [[metacarpophalangeal joint]]s connecting the phalanges to the metacarpal bones.

The ''pulp of a finger'' is the fleshy mass on the palmar aspect of the extremity of the finger.<ref>[http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=73927 medilexicon.com > Medical Dictionary - 'Pulp Of Finger'] Citing: Stedman's Medical Dictionary. 2006</ref>

===Muscles===
[[File:Temporal-Control-and-Hand-Movement-Efficiency-in-Skilled-Music-Performance-pone.0050901.s001.ogv|thumb|The precision of finger movements in space and time is highlighted in this [[motion capture|motion tracking]] of two [[pianist]]s' fingers playing the same piece (slow motion, no sound).<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0050901}}</ref>]]
Each finger may [[flexion|flex]] and [[extension (kinesiology)|extend]], [[abduction (kinesiology)|abduct]] and [[adduction|adduct]], and so  also [[circumduction (anatomy)|circumduct]]. Flexion is by far the strongest movement. In humans, there are two large muscles that produce flexion of each finger, and additional muscles that augment the movement. Each finger may move independently of the others, though the muscle bulks that move each finger may be partly blended, and the tendons may be attached to each other by a net of fibrous tissue, preventing completely free movement.

Fingers do not contain muscles (other than [[arrector pili]]). The [[muscle]]s that move the finger joints are in the [[Hand|palm]] and [[forearm]]. The long tendons that deliver motion from the forearm muscles may be observed to move under the skin at the wrist and on the back of the hand.

Muscles of the fingers can be subdivided into extrinsic and intrinsic muscles.
The extrinsic muscles are the long flexors and extensors. They are called extrinsic because the muscle belly is located on the forearm.

The fingers have two long flexors, located on the underside of the forearm. They insert by tendons to the phalanges of the fingers. The deep flexor attaches to the distal phalanx, and the superficial flexor attaches to the middle phalanx. The flexors allow for the actual bending of the fingers. The thumb has one long flexor and a short flexor in the thenar muscle group. The human thumb also has other muscles in the thenar group ([[opponens pollicis|opponens]] and [[abductor pollicis brevis muscle|abductor brevis muscle]]), moving the thumb in opposition, making grasping possible.

The extensors are located on the back of the forearm and are connected in a more complex way than the flexors to the dorsum of the fingers. The tendons unite with the interosseous and lumbrical muscles to form the extensorhood mechanism. The primary function of the extensors is to straighten out the digits. The thumb has two extensors in the forearm; the tendons of these form the [[anatomical snuff box]]. Also, the index finger and the little finger have an extra extensor, used for instance for pointing. The extensors are situated within 6 separate compartments. The 1st compartment contains abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis. The 2nd compartment contains extensors carpi radialis longus and brevis. The 3rd compartment contains extensor pollicis longus. The extensor digitorum indicis and extensor digititorum communis are within the 4th compartment. Extensor digiti minimi is in the fifth, and extensor carpi ulnaris is in the 6th.

The intrinsic muscle groups are the [[thenar]] and [[hypothenar]] muscles (thenar referring to the thumb, hypothenar to the small finger), the [[dorsal interossei of the hand|dorsal]] and [[palmar interossei muscles]] (between the metacarpal bones) and the [[lumbricals of the hand|lumbrical muscles]]. The lumbricals arise from the [[flexor digitorum profundus muscle|deep flexor]] (and are special because they have no bony origin) and insert on the dorsal extensor hood mechanism.

===Skin===
Aside from the [[sex organ|genitals]], the fingertips possess the highest concentration of [[somatosensory system|touch receptors]] and [[thermoreceptor]]s among all areas of the human skin{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}, making them extremely sensitive to temperature, pressure, vibration, texture and moisture.  Thus fingers are commonly used as sensory probes to ascertain properties of objects encountered in the world, and so they are prone to [[injury]].

===Fingertip wrinkling in water===
The wrinkling of the fingertips when immersed for a period in water such as swimming or bathing may be an adaption from a time when humans frequented  semi aquatic environment such as swamps or sea shores. A study found that the wrinkled fingertips provided much better handling of wet objects but gave no advantage for dry objects. For a long time, it was assumed that the wrinkles were simply the result of the skin swelling in water, but other studies have shown the furrows to be caused by the blood vessels constricting in reaction to the water, and that it is  controlled by the [[sympathetic nervous system]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20951232 Science puts wrinkled fingers to the test]   Jonathan Amos , BBC News Science correspondent, 9 January 2013.</ref>

===Brain representation===
Each finger has an orderly somatotopic representation on the [[cerebral cortex]] in the [[somatosensory cortex]] area 3b,<ref>van Westen D, Fransson P, Olsrud J, Rosén B, Lundborg G, Larsson EM. (2004). [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=517711&blobtype=pdf Fingersomatotopy in area 3b: an fMRI-study].

The somatosensory cortex representation of the hand is a dynamic reflection of the fingers on the external hand: in [[syndactyly]] people have a [[clubhand]] of webbed, shortened fingers. However, not only are the fingers of their hands fused, but the cortical maps of their individual fingers also form a club hand. The fingers can be surgically divided to make a more useful hand. Surgeons did this at the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery in New York to a 32-year-old man with the initials O. G.. They touched O. G.’s fingers before and after surgery while using MRI brain scans. Before the surgery, the fingers mapped onto his brain were fused close together; afterward, the maps of his individual fingers did indeed separate and take the layout corresponding to a normal hand.<ref>Mogilner A, Grossman JA, Ribary U, Joliot M, Volkmann J, Rapaport D, Beasley RW, Llinás RR. (1993). [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=46347&blobtype=pdf Somatosensory cortical plasticity in adult humans revealed by magnetoencephalography].

===Anomalies, injuries and diseases===
[[File:Syndactyly type1 hands.jpg|thumb|Radiograph of Type 1 [[Syndactyly]]]]
A rare anatomical variation affects 1 in 500 humans,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.drgreene.com/21_182.html | title=Polydactylism | publisher=drgreene.com | first=Alan | last=Greene | date=May 19, 1997 | accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref> in which the individual has more than the usual number of digits; this is known as [[polydactyly]]. A human may also be born without one or more fingers or underdevelopment of some fingers such as [[symbrachydactyly]]. Extra fingers can be functional. One individual with seven fingers not only used them but claimed that they “gave him some advantages in playing the piano.”<ref>Dwight T. (1892). Fusion of hands. Memoirs of the Boston Society of Natural History, 4, 473-486.</ref>

[[Phalanx bones|Phalanges]] are commonly fractured. A damaged tendon can cause significant loss of function in fine motor control, such as with a [[mallet finger]].

The fingers are commonly affected by diseases such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[gout]]. [[Diabetic]]s often use the fingers to obtain blood samples for regular blood sugar testing. [[Raynaud's phenomenon]] is a neurovascular disorder that affects the fingers.

Research has linked the [[Digit ratio|ratio of lengths between the index and ring fingers]] to higher levels of [[testosterone]], and to various [[Digit ratio#Correlation between digit ratio and traits|physical and behavioral traits]] such as penis length<ref>[http://men.webmd.com/news/20110705/study-penis-size-linked-to-length-of-fingers Researchers Find Association Between Penile Length and Ratio of Length of Men's Fingers]</ref> and risk for development of alcohol dependence.<ref>[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0019332#abstract0 Kornhuber J, Erhard G, Lenz B, Kraus T, Sperling W, Bayerlein K, Biermann T, Stoessel C (2011): Low digit ratio 2D:4D in alcohol dependent patients. PLoS ONE, Vol. 6, Nr. 4, e19332.]</ref>

==Other animals==
[[Chimpanzee]]s have lower limbs that are specialized for manipulation, and (arguably) have fingers on their lower limbs as well. The term 'finger' is not applied to the digits of most other animals, such as [[Canidae|canine]]s, [[Felidae|felines]], or [[ungulates]], none of which can engage in fine manipulation with their forelimbs as a primate can.
