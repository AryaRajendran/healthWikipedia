'''Definitions of abortion''' vary from one source to another.  [[Abortion]] has many definitions that can differ from each other in significant ways.  Given the contentious nature of abortion, lawmakers and other stakeholders often face controversy in defining abortion.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Arzuaga|first=Bonnie Hope|coauthors=Lee, Ben Hokew|title=Limits of Human Viability in the United States: A Medicolegal Review.|journal=Pediatrics|year=2011|month=December|volume=128|issue=6|pages=p1047-1052|accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Morag‐Levine|first=Noga|title=Imported problem definitions, legal culture and the local dynamics of Israeli abortion politics|journal=Israel Affairs|year=1998|volume=5|issue=2-3|accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref>  Influential non-state actors like the United Nations<ref>{{cite news|last=Hale|first=Ellen|title=Definitions slow debate on abortions|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=Definitions slow debate on abortions|date=September 9, 1994|newspaper=USA Today|page=1A}}</ref> and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] have also engendered controversy over efforts to define abortion.<ref>{{cite news|title=Defining the undefined key in abortion debate.

==Concerns in the medical community==
Ambiguous definitions can create concerns in the medical community.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roe|first=K.M.|title=Private troubles and public issues: providing abortion amid competing definitions|journal=Social Science & Medicine|year=1989|volume=29|issue=10|accessdate=3 January 2013|pages=1191–8}}</ref>  Physicians in several countries, including Ireland<ref>{{cite news|last=Coulter|first=Carol|title=Legislation to clarify abortion issue advised|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=Legislation to clarify abortion issue advised|date=July 4, 1996|page=7}}</ref><ref name=Irish>{{cite news|last=Cassidy|first=Coleman|title=Definition of abortion is crucial gynaecologist|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=May 10, 2000|page=6|quote=The definition of abortion is crucial to the efforts of the all-party Oireachtas committee, when it comes to make its recommendations, Dr Alistair McFar lane, a retired obstetrician and gynaecologist, told the hearing. No definition appeared in the Green Paper, he said, and the committee had heard a number of accounts from the various medical experts in the past week which differed as to whether or not the ending of pregnancy in certain procedures (carried out by all obstetricians on medical grounds) amounted to abortion.}}</ref> and Canada,<ref>{{cite news|last=Brunt|first=Stephen|title=MDs seek precise definition in new law|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=The Globe and Mail (Canada)|date=July 28, 1988}}</ref> have expressed concern over ambiguous definitions of abortion.  Even in situations where there is a clear definition of abortion, it does not always match definitions of related terms in effect in the same [[jurisdiction]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schoen|first=Wendy L.|title=NOTE AND COMMENT: CONFLICT IN THE PARAMETERS DEFINING LIFE AND DEATH IN MISSOURI STATUTES|journal=American Journal of Law & Medicine|year=1990|volume=16|issue=555|accessdate=3 January 2013|quote=The mere fact that a certain class of decisions is difficult cannot justify the absence of consistent supporting standards. Each state must compare the language of its statutes to determine whether the definitions of the parameters of life conflict. If these definitions conflict, as is the case with Missouri's Definition of Death and abortion regulation statutes, the state must amend the existing language to bring into concert the criteria defining these parameters. Each state should decide whether to accomplish this goal by changing its statute in which death is defined or by changing any other statute with conflicting criteria.}}</ref>

==Examples of definitions==
The following is a partial list of definitions as stated by [[obstetrics and gynecology]] (OB/GYN) textbooks, dictionaries, and other [[encyclopedias]]:

;Major OB/GYN textbooks
* The [[National Center for Health Statistics]] defines an "abortus" as "[a] fetus or embryo removed or expelled from the uterus during the first half of gestation—20 weeks or less, or in the absence of accurate dating criteria, born weighing < 500 g." They also define "birth" as "[t]he complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of a fetus after 20 weeks' gestation. [...] in the absence of accurate dating criteria, fetuses weighing <500 g are usually not considered as births, but rather are termed abortuses for purposes of vital statistics."<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Cunningham|editor1-first=FG|editor2-last=Leveno|editor2-first=KJ|editor3-last=Bloom|editor3-first=SL|editor4-last=Hauth|editor4-first=JC|editor5-last=Rouse|editor5-first=DJ|editor6-last=Spong|editor6-first=CY|chapter=1.

* "[Abortion] is commonly misunderstood outside medical circles. In general terms, the word 'abortion' simply means the failure of something to reach fulfilment or maturity. Medically, abortion means loss of the fetus, for any reason, before it is able to survive outside the womb. The term covers accidental or spontaneous ending, or miscarriage, of pregnancy as well as deliberate termination. The terms 'spontaneous abortion' and 'miscarriage' are synonymous and are defined as loss of the fetus before the twenty-eighth week of pregnancy. This definition implies a legal perception of the age at which a fetus can survive out of the womb. With great advances in recent years in the ability to keep very premature babies alive, this definition is in need of revision."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Abortion and miscarriage|encyclopedia=The Royal Society of Medicine Health Encyclopedia|location=London|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2000}}</ref>
