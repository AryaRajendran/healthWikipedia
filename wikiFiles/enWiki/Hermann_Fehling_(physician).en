'''Hermann Johannes Karl Fehling''' (July 14, 1847 - November 11, 1925) was a German [[obstetrician]] and [[gynecologist]] who was a native of [[Stuttgart]]. He was the son of the chemist [[Hermann von Fehling]] (1811-1885).

In 1872 he received his medical doctorate from the [[University of Leipzig]], and following graduation remained in [[Leipzig]] as an assistant to [[obstetrician]] [[Carl Siegmund Franz Credé]] (1819-1892). In 1877 he became director of the [[Württemberg]] state [[midwifery]] school in [[Stuttgart]], and later accepted a teaching job at the [[University of Tübingen]] (1883). 

In 1887 he became a professor of obstetrics at the [[University of Basel]], and afterwards served as a professor at the Universities of [[University of Halle|Halle]] (1894) and [[University of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] (1900). In the aftermath of [[World War I]], Fehling along with other German professors were expelled from the University of Strasbourg. He eventually settled in [[Baden-Baden]], where he died in 1925.

Hermann Fehling is considered to be one of the leading gynecologists of his era, and made contributions in his research of disorders that included [[eclampsia]], [[rachitic]] [[human pelvis|pelvis]] and puerperal [[osteomalacia]]. In 1877, with [[Heinrich Fritsch]] (1844-1915), he founded the journal ''Zentralblatt für Gynäkologie''.
