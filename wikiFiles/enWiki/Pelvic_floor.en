The '''pelvic floor''' or '''pelvic diaphragm''' is composed of muscle fibers of the [[levator ani]], the [[coccygeus]], and associated [[connective tissue]] which span the area underneath the [[pelvis]]. The pelvic diaphragm is a muscular partition formed by the levatores ani and coccygei, with which may be included the parietal pelvic fascia on their upper and lower aspects. The pelvic floor separates the [[pelvic cavity]] above from the perineal region (including [[perineum]]) below.

The right and left levator ani lie almost horizontally in the floor of the pelvis, separated by a narrow gap that transmits the urethra, vagina, and anal canal. The levator ani is usually considered in three parts: [[pubococcygeus]], [[puborectalis]], and [[iliococcygeus]]. The pubococcygeus, the main part of the levator, runs backward from the body of the pubis toward the coccyx and may be damaged during parturition. Some fibers are inserted into the prostate, urethra, and vagina. The right and left puborectalis unite behind the anorectal junction to form a muscular sling. Some regard them as a part of the [[sphincter ani externus]]. The [[iliococcygeus]], the most posterior part of the levator ani, is often poorly developed.

The coccygeus, situated behind the levator ani and frequently tendinous as much as muscular, extends from the ischial spine to the lateral margin of the sacrum and coccyx.  

The [[pelvic cavity]] of the [[true pelvis]] has the pelvic floor as its inferior border (and the [[pelvic brim]] as its superior border).  The [[perineum]] has the pelvic floor as its superior border.

Some sources do not consider "pelvic floor" and "pelvic diaphragm" to be identical, with the "diaphragm" consisting of only the levator ani and coccygeus, while the "floor" also includes the [[perineal membrane]] and [[deep perineal pouch]].<ref>{{cite book |last= |first= Drake |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title= Gray's Anatomy For Students |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |date= |year= 2005 |month= |publisher= |location= |language= |id= |doi = |pages=391 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote = |author-separator= , |author2= Richard L. |display-authors= 2 }}</ref> However, other sources include the [[fascia]] as part of the diaphragm.<ref>{{eMedicineDictionary|Pelvic+diaphragm}}</ref> In practice, the two terms are often used interchangeably.

Posteriorly, the pelvic floor extends into the [[anal triangle]].

==Function==
It is important in providing support for pelvic [[viscera]] (organs), e.g. the [[urinary bladder|bladder]], [[intestine]]s, the [[uterus]] (in females), and in maintenance of [[wikt:continence|continence]] as part of the [[Urethral sphincter|urinary]] and [[anus|anal]] sphincters. It facilitates birth by resisting the descent of the presenting part, causing the fetus to rotate forwards to navigate through the pelvic girdle.

==Clinical significance==
In women, the levator muscles or their supplying nerves can be damaged in pregnancy or [[childbirth]]. There is some evidence that these muscles may also be damaged during a [[hysterectomy]].  Pelvic surgery using the "perineal approach" (between the anus and coccyx) is an established cause of damage to the pelvic floor.  This surgery includes [[coccygectomy]].

In female high-level athletes, perineal trauma is rare and is associated with certain sports (each with a distinct type of trauma): [[water-skiing]], [[bicycle racing]], and [[equestrian sports]].<ref name="pmid17450681">{{cite journal

Damage to the pelvic floor not only contributes to urinary incontinence but can lead to pelvic organ [[prolapse]].  Pelvic organ prolapse occurs in women when pelvic organs (e.g. the vagina, bladder, rectum, or uterus) protrude into or outside of the vagina.  The causes of pelvic organ prolapse are not unlike those that also contribute to urinary incontinence.  These include inappropriate (asymmetrical, excessive, insufficient) muscle tone and asymmetries caused by trauma to the pelvis.  Age, pregnancy, family history, and hormonal status all contribute to the development of pelvic organ prolapse.  The vagina is suspended by attachments to the perineum, pelvic side wall and sacrum via attachments that include collagen, elastin, and smooth muscle.  Surgery can be performed to repair pelvic floor muscles.  The pelvic floor muscles can be strengthened with [[Kegel_exercise|Kegel exercises]].

Disorders of the posterior pelvic floor include [[rectal prolapse]], [[rectocele]], [[perineal hernia]], and a number of functional disorders including [[anismus]].  [[Constipation]] due to any of these disorders is called "functional constipation" and is identifiable by clinical diagnostic criteria.<ref name="pmid16720016">{{cite journal

Pelvic floor exercise (PFE), also known as [[Kegel exercises]], may improve the tone and function of the pelvic floor muscles, which is of particular benefit for women (and less commonly men) who experience [[stress urinary incontinence]].<ref name="pmid15971718">{{cite journal

}}</ref>  However, compliance with PFE programs often is poor,<ref name="pmid15971718"/> PFE generally is ineffective for urinary incontinence unless performed with [[biofeedback]] and trained supervision,<ref name="pmid12806450"/> and in severe cases it may have no benefit.  Pelvic floor muscle tone may be estimated using a [[perineometer]], which measures the pressure within the vagina.  Medication may also be used to improve continence.  In severe cases, surgery may be used to repair or even to reconstruct the pelvic floor. It has been reported that patients who have overly-toned musculature may suffer from inability to relax the pelvic floor muscles - in effect, Kegel exercises would only exacerbate the problem. http://www.massagetoday.com/mpacms/mt/article.php?id=13515

[[Perineology]] or pelviperineology is a speciality dealing with the functional troubles of the three axis (urological, gynaecological and coloproctological) of the pelvic floor.
