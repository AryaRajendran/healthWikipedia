==Early life and education==

Jacob Levy Moreno was born in [[Bucharest]] in the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. His father was Moreno Nissim Levy, a [[Sephardi]] Jewish merchant born in 1856 in Plevna in the [[Ottoman Empire]] (today [[Pleven]], [[Bulgaria]]). Jacob's grandfather Buchis had moved to Plevna from [[Constantinople]], where his ancestors had settled after they left [[Spain]] in 1492. It is thought that the Morenos left Plevna for Bucharest during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878]], following the Plevna rabbi Haim Bejarano in search of a more hospitable environment. Jacob Moreno's mother, Paulina Iancu or Wolf, was also a Sephardi Jew, born in 1873, and originated from [[Călăraşi]], Romania.<ref name="marineau">{{cite book|last=Marineau|first=René F.|title=Jacob Levy Moreno, 1889-1974: father of psychodrama, sociometry, and group psychotherapy|publisher=Routledge|year=1989|pages=4–6|chapter=Ancestors and family: the birth of a myth|isbn=978-0-415-04383-0}}</ref>

In 1895, at time of great intellectual creativity and political turmoil, the family moved to [[Vienna]]. He studied [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], and [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Vienna]], becoming a [[Doctor of Medicine]] in 1917. He had rejected Freudian theory while still a medical student, and became interested in the potential of group settings for therapeutic practice.<ref name="lucyozarin">[http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/38/10/60 Biographical detail]: article by Lucy Ozarin, ''Psychiatric News'' (Volume 38, Number 10), May 16, 2003.

In his autobiography, Dr. Moreno recalls this encounter with [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1912. "I attended one of Freud’s lectures. He had just finished an analysis of a telepathic dream. As the students filed out, he singled me out from the crowd and asked me what I was doing. I responded, 'Well, Dr. Freud, I start where you leave off. You meet people in the artificial setting of your office. I meet them on the street and in their homes, in their natural surroundings. You analyze their dreams. I give them the courage to dream again. You analyze and tear them apart. I let them act out their conflicting roles and help them to put the parts back together again.'"<ref name="autobiography">The Autobiography of J. L. Moreno, M.D.
(Abridged), J. L. Moreno, Moreno Archives, Harvard University, 1985.</ref>

==Career==
Moreno picked up where Freud left off, with his theory of [[interpersonal relationship|interpersonal relations]], and the development of his work in [[psychodrama]], [[sociometry]], [[group psychotherapy]], [[sociodrama]], and [[sociatry]].

Moving to the U.S. in 1925, he began working in New York City. In his autobiography he states that, of all the places in the world "only in New York, the melting pot of the nations, the vast metropolis, with all its freedom from all preconceived notions, could I be free to pursue sociometric group research in the grand style I had envisioned".<ref>Journal of Group Psychotherapy, Psychodrama & Sociometry (Vol. 42, No. 1), J. L. Moreno, spring 1989.</ref>

He later held positions at [[Columbia University]]<ref>[http://www.agpa.org/pubs/GC_0802_moreno.html Taught at Columbia University], evidenced in recollection: article by Mary Nicholas & Gene Eliasoph, ''The Group Circle'' (August/September 2002), [[American Group Psychotherapy Association]].

Retrieved on December 30, 2007.</ref>

In 1932, Dr. Moreno first introduced group psychotherapy to the [[American Psychiatric Association]]. For the next 40 years he developed and introduced his Theory of Interpersonal Relations and tools for social sciences he called 'sociodrama', 'psychodrama', 'sociometry', and 'sociatry'. In his monograph entitled, "The Future of Man's World", he describes how he developed these sciences to counteract "the economic materialism of [[Karl Marx|Marx]], the psychological materialism of Freud, and the technological materialism" of our modern industrial age.<ref>The Future of Man's World, J. L. Moreno, New York Beacon House, Psychodrama Monographs, 1947.</ref>

His autobiography describes his position as "threefold: 
#Spontaneity and creativity are the propelling forces in human progress, beyond and independent of libido and socioeconomic motives [that] are frequently interwoven with spontaneity-creativity, but [this proposition] does deny that spontaneity and creativity are merely a function and derivative of libido or socioeconomic motives.
#Love and mutual sharing are powerful, indispensable working principles in group life. Therefore, it is imperative that we have faith in our fellow man’s intentions, a faith which transcends mere obedience arising from physical or legalistic coercion.
#That a super dynamic community based on these principles can be brought to realization through new techniques..."<ref name="autobiography" />

Moreno died in New York City in 1974, aged 84.<ref name="lucyozarin" /> He chose to die by abstaining from all food and water after a long illness.  His epitaph, at his request, reads "the man who brought laughter to psychiatry."  <ref>{{cite book|title=Current Approaches in Drama Therapy|edition=2nd|editor1-first=David Read|editor1-last=Johnson|editor2-first=Renée|editor2-last=Emunah|year=2009|publisher=Charles C.

==Summary of contribution==
There is evidence that the methods of J. L. Moreno have held up respectably over time.<ref>Psychotherapy Networker, Clinician's Digest, January/February 2007.</ref> Subsequent research from the University of Vienna shows the enormous influence that Moreno's theory of the Encounter (Invitations to an Encounter, 1914) had on the development of [[Martin Buber]]'s I-Thou philosophy, and Buber's influence on philosophy, theology, and psychology. His wife, Zerka Moreno, writes: "While it is true that Buber broadened the idea of the Encounter, he did not create the instruments for it to occur." Moreno "produced the various instruments we now use for facilitating the human encounter, sociometry, group psychotherapy, psychodrama, and sociodrama".<ref>Psychodrama Network News, Zerka Moreno, winter 2007.</ref>   Zerka is herself an expert in psychodrama and sociometry, and continues her late husband's work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psychotherapy.net/interview/Zerka_Moreno |title=Zerka Moreno |publisher=Psychotherapy.net |date=September 2004 }}</ref>

With training centers and institutes on nearly every continent, there are many thousands of students who are expanding and developing training and teaching the Morenean Arts & Sciences across the disciplines, to more fully realize Moreno's vision to make these social sciences available for "the whole of [hu]mankind."<ref>[http://www.morenoinstituteeast.org/ Morenean Arts & Sciences]: ''Moreno Institute East'' website. Retrieved on December 29, 2007.</ref>

Moreno is also widely credited as one of the founders of the discipline of [[Social network|social network analysis]], the branch of sociology that deals with the quantitative evaluation of an individual's role in a group or community by analysis of the network of connections between them and others.  His 1934 book ''Who Shall Survive?'' contains some of the earliest graphical depictions of social networks.
