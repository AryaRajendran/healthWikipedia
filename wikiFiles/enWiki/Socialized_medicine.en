{{About|the term "Socialized medicine" as it is used in U.S. politics|national health care systems generally |Universal health care}}

'''Socialized medicine''' is a term used in the [[United States]] to describe and discuss systems of [[universal health care]] - that is, medical and hospital care for all at a nominal cost by means of government regulation of [[health care]] and subsidies derived from [[taxation]].<ref>The American Heritage Medical Dictionary, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company</ref> Because of historically negative associations with [[socialism]] in American culture, the term is usually used [[pejorative]]ly in American political discourse.<ref name="autogenerated2">Paul Burleigh Horton, Gerald R.

==Background==

The original meaning was confined to systems in which the government operates health care facilities and employs health care professionals.<ref name="NPR"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/57/S0525700.html|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/so/socmed.html|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition}}</ref><ref>Jacob S. Hacker, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/21/AR2008032102743.html "Socialized Medicine: Let's Try a Dose, We're Bound to Feel Better"], Washington Post, March 23, 2008.</ref> This narrower usage would apply to the British [[National Health Service]] hospital trusts and health systems that operate in other countries as diverse as Finland, Spain, Israel, and Cuba. The United States' [[Veterans Health Administration]], and the medical departments of the [[Army Medical Department (United States)|US Army]], [[Surgeon General of the United States Navy|Navy]], and [[Air Force Medical Service|Air Force]], would also fall under this narrow definition. When used in this way, the narrow definition permits a clear distinction from [[Single-payer health care|single payer health insurance]] systems, in which the government finances health care but is not involved in care delivery.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Single Payer article from AMSA | url=http://www.amsa.org/uhc/SinglePayer101.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=25521|title=MedTerms medical dictionary}}</ref>

More recently, American conservative critics of [[Health care reform in the United States|health care reform]] have attempted to broaden the term by applying it to any publicly funded system. [[Medicare (Canada)|Canada's Medicare]] system and most of the UK's NHS [[general practitioner]] and [[dentistry|dental]] services, which are systems where health care is delivered by private business with partial or total government funding, fit this broader definition, as do the health care systems of most of Western Europe. In the United States, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], and the [[Military of the United States|US military's]] [[TRICARE]] fall under this definition.

Most industrialized countries, and many developing countries, operate some form of publicly funded health care with universal coverage as the goal. According to the [[Institute of Medicine]] and others, the United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not provide [[universal health care]].<ref name="IOM">[http://www.iom.edu/?id=17848 Insuring America's Health: Principles and Recommendations], Institute of Medicine at the National Academies of Science, 2004-01-14, accessed 2007-10-22</ref><ref>[http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm The Case For Single Payer, Universal Health Care For The United States]</ref>

Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina, maintains that the term is merely a political pejorative that has been defined to mean different levels of government involvement in health care depending on what the speaker was arguing against at the time.<ref name="NPR">[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16962482 Socialized Medicine Belittled on Campaign Trail] from NPR.</ref>

The term is often used by conservatives in the U.S to imply that the privately run health care system would become controlled by the government, thereby associating it with [[socialism]], which has negative connotations to some people in American political culture.<ref name="MFriedman">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hillsdale.edu/hctools/imprimis_archive/2006/07/2006_07_Imprimis.pdf |title=Free to Choose: A Conversation with Milton Friedman |accessdate=2008-04-14|format=PDF}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> As such its usage is controversial,<ref name="autogenerated6" /><ref name="autogenerated3" /><ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref name="NPR" /> and at odds with the views of conservatives in other countries prepared to defend socialized medicine such as [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref>http://opinion.publicfinance.co.uk/2009/08/the-end-is-nye/</ref>

==History of the term==
When the term "socialized medicine" first appeared in the United States in the early 1900s, it bore no negative connotations. Otto P. Geier, chairman of the Preventive Medicine Section of the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA), was quoted in ''The New York Times'' in 1917 as praising socialized medicine as a way to "discover disease in its incipiency," help end "venereal diseases, alcoholism, tuberculosis," and "make a fundamental contribution to social welfare."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9B03E2DE133BE03ABC4953DFB166838C609EDE |title=World at War is Facing a Shortage of Doctors|accessdate=2009-04-02 |date=1917-07-01 |work= |publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' | format=PDF}}</ref>  However, by the 1930s, the term socialized medicine was routinely used negatively by [[American conservatism|conservative]] opponents of [[publicly funded health care]] who wished to imply it represented socialism, and by extension, communism.<ref name="Slate history lesson">{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2175477 |title=Who's Afraid of Socialized Medicine?

Truman Library and Museum</ref> and many others. Truman announced before describing his proposal that: "This is not socialized medicine".<ref name="Slate history lesson"/>

Government involvement in health care was ardently opposed by the AMA which distributed posters to doctors with slogans such as "Socialized medicine ... will undermine the democratic form of government."<ref>Olivier Garceau, "Organized Medicine Enforces its 'Party Line'", Public Opinion Quarterly, September 1940, p. 416.</ref> According to T.R. Reid (''The Healing of America'', 2009): <blockquote>"The term ['socialized medicine'] was popularized by a public relations firm working for the American Medical Association in 1947 to disparage President Truman's proposal for a national health care system. It was a label, at the dawn of the [[cold war]], meant to suggest that anybody advocating universal access to health care must be a communist. And the phrase has retained its political power for six decades."<ref name="T.R. Reid, 2009"/><ref name="abcnews.go.com"/></blockquote>

The AMA conducted a nationwide campaign called [[Operation Coffee Cup]] during the late 1950s and early 1960s in opposition to the Democrats' plans to extend [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] to include health insurance for the elderly, later known as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. As part of the plan, doctors' wives would organize coffee meetings in an attempt to convince acquaintances to write letters to Congress opposing the program.<ref name=OCC>{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/16/magazine/16SOCIAL.html | title=A Question of Numbers| publisher=[[The New York Times]] | author=Roger Lowenstein| date=2009-07-27}}</ref> In 1961, [[Ronald Reagan]] recorded a disc entitled [[Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine]] exhorting its audience to abhor the "dangers" which socialized medicine could bring.

==Political controversies in the United States==

{{Debate|date=January 2011}}

Although the marginal scope of free or subsidized medicine provided is much discussed within the political body in most countries with socialized health care systems, there is little or no evidence of strong public pressure for the removal of subsidies or the privatization of health care in those countries. The political distaste for government involvement in health care in the U.S. is unique counter to the trend  found in other developed countries{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}{{Dubious|date=September 2009}}

In the United States, neither of the main parties favors a socialized system that puts the government in charge of hospitals or doctors, but they do have different approaches to financing and access. Democrats tend to be favorably inclined towards reform that involves more government control over health care financing and citizens' right of access to health care. Republicans are broadly in favor of the status quo, or a reform of the financing system that gives more power to the citizen, often through tax credits.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===Cost of care===
Socialized medicine amongst industrialized countries tends to be more affordable than in systems where there is little government involvement. A 2003 study examined costs and outputs in the U.S and other industrialized countries and broadly concluded that the U.S spends so much because its health care system is more costly. It noted that "...the United States spent considerably more on health care than any other country...[yet] most measures of aggregate utilization such as physician visits per capita and hospital days per capita were below the OECD median. Since spending is a product of both the goods and services used and their prices, this implies that much higher prices are paid in the United States than in other countries.<ref>http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/22/3/89#T5 '''It’s The Prices, Stupid: Why The United States Is So Different From Other Countries'''
Gerard F. Anderson, Uwe E. Reinhardt, Peter S. Hussey and Varduhi Petrosyan ''Health Affairs''</ref>". The researchers examined possible reasons and concluded that input costs were high (salaries, cost of pharmaceutical), and that the complex payment system in the U.S added higher administrative costs. Comparison countries in Canada and Europe were much more willing to exert [[monopsony]] power to drive down prices, whilst the highly fragmented buy side of the U.S health system was one factor that could explain the relatively high prices in the United States of America.

Other studies have found no consistent and systematic relationship between the type of financing of health care and cost containment; the efficiency of operation of the health care system itself appears to depend much more on how providers are paid and how the delivery of care is organized than on the method used to raise these funds.<ref>Sherry A. Glied, [http://www.nber.org/papers/w13881.pdf "Health Care Financing, Efficiency, and Equity,"] [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] Working Paper No. 13881, March 2008</ref>

Some supporters argue that government involvement in health care would reduce costs not just because of the exercise of monopsony power, e.g. in drug purchasing,<ref>[http://www.pnhp.org/facts/singlepayer_faq.php#drug_prices Single-Payer FAQ | Physicians for a National Health Program<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but also because it eliminates profit margins and administrative overhead associated with private insurance, and because it can make use of [[economies of scale]] in administration.  In certain circumstances, a volume purchaser may be able to guarantee sufficient volume to reduce overall prices while providing greater profitability to the seller, such as in so-called 'purchase commitment' programs.<ref>[http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2005/10/lofgren.html ARPA: Purchase commitments: Big business bias or solution to the ‘neglected diseases’ dilemma?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>{{Dubious|date=June 2008}} Economist Arnold Kling attributes the present cost crisis mainly to the practice of what he calls "premium medicine," which overuses expensive forms of technology that is of marginal or no proven benefit.<ref>Arnold S.

Milton Friedman has argued that government has weak incentives to reduce costs because "nobody spends somebody else’s money as wisely or as frugally as he spends his own".<ref name="How to Cure Health Care">Milton Friedman, [http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3459466.html How to Cure Health Care]</ref> Others contend that health care consumption is not like other consumer consumption. Firstly there is a negative utility of consumption (consuming more health care does not make one better off) and secondly there is an [[information asymmetry]] between consumer and supplier.<ref>http://healthcare-economist.com/2006/09/21/information-asymmetry-insurance-and-the-decision-to-hospitalize/ Blomqvist, Åke; Léger, Pierre Thomas (2005) “Information asymmetry, insurance and the decision to hospitalize” Journal of Health Economics, Vol 24(4), pp. 775-793.</ref>

[[Paul Krugman]] and Robin Wells argue that all of the evidence indicates that public insurance of the kind available in several European countries achieves equal or better results at much lower cost, a conclusion that also applies within the United States. In terms of actual administrative costs, Medicare spent less than 2 percent of its resources on administration, while private insurance companies spent more than 13 percent.<ref>Paul Krugman and Robin Wells, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 "The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It"], The New York Review of Books, Volume 53, Number 5, March 23, 2006</ref> The Cato Institute argues that the 2 percent Medicare cost figure ignores all costs shifted to doctors and hospitals, and alleges that Medicare is not very efficient at all when those costs are incorporated.<ref>{{Cite web| author=John Goodman | title=Five Myths of Socialized Medicine | work=[[Cato Institute]] | year=Winter, 2005 | url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/catosletter/catosletterv3n1.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> Some studies have found that the U.S wastes more on bureaucracy (compared to the Canadian level), and that this excess administrative cost would be sufficient to provide health care to the uninsured population in the US.<ref>Summary of New England Journal of Medicine Study, [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8800.php USA wastes more on health care bureaucracy than it would cost to provide health care to all of the uninsured], Medical News Today, 28 May 2004.</ref>

Notwithstanding the arguments about Medicare, there is overall less bureaucracy in socialized systems than in the present mixed U.S system. Spending on administration in Finland is 2.1% of all health care costs, and in the UK the figure is 3.3% whereas the U.S spends 7.3% of all expenditures on administration.<ref>http://www.commonwealthfund.org/usr_doc/Collins_universal_hlt_insurance_testimony_06-26-2007_figures.ppt?section=4039#320,14, Figure 14. Percentage of National Health Expenditures Spent on Health Administration and Insurance, 2003</ref>

===Quality of care===
Some in the U.S claim that socialized medicine would reduce health care quality. The quantitative evidence for this claim is not clear. The WHO has used Disability Adjusted Life Expectancy (the number of years an average person can expect to live in good health) as a measure of a nation's health achievement, and has ranked its member nations by this measure.<ref>http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf WHO. World Health Report 2000</ref>  The U.S ranking was 24th, worse than similar industrial countries that have very high public funding of health such as Canada (ranked 5th), the UK (12th), Sweden (4th), France (3rd) and Japan (1st). But the U.S ranking was better than some other European countries such as Ireland, Denmark and Portugal, which came 27th, 28th and 29th respectively. Finland, with its relatively high death rate from guns and renowned high suicide rate came above the U.S in 20th place. The British have a Care Quality Commission that commissions independent surveys of the quality of care given in its health institutions and these are publicly accessible over the internet.<ref>http://www.nhssurveys.org</ref> These determine whether health organizations are meeting public standards for quality set by government and allows regional comparisons. Whether these results indicate a better or worse situation to that in other countries such as the U.S is hard to tell because these countries tend to lack a similar set of standards.

===Taxation===
Opponents claim that socialized medicine would require higher taxes but international comparisons do not support this. The ratio of public to private spending on health is lower in the U.S than that of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, or any EU country. Yet the per capita tax funding of health in those countries is already lower than that of the United States.<ref>http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_20072008_EN_Indicator_tables.pdf UN Human Development Report 2007/2008 Table 6 Page 247</ref>

Taxation is not necessarily an unpopular form of funding for health care. In England, a survey for the British Medical Association of the general public showed overwhelming support for the tax funding of health care. Nine out of ten people agreed or strongly agreed with a statement that the NHS should be funded from taxation with care being free at the point of use.<ref>http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/AttachmentsByTitle/PDFnhssystreform2007/$FILE/48751Surveynhsreform.pdf Survey of the general public’s views on NHS system reform - in England: BMA June 2007</ref>

An [[opinion piece]] in ''The Wall Street Journal'' by two conservative Republicans argues that government sponsored health care will legitimatize support for government services generally, and make an activist government acceptable. "Once a large number of citizens get their health care from the state, it dramatically alters their attachment to government. Every time a tax cut is proposed, the guardians of the new medical-welfare state will argue that tax cuts would come at the expense of health care -- an argument that would resonate with middle-class families entirely dependent on the government for access to doctors and hospitals."<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123207075026188601.html Beware of the Big-Government Tipping Point], Peter Wehner and Paul Ryan, The Wall Street Journal, January 16, 2009</ref>

===Innovation===
Some in the U.S argue that if government were to use its size to bargain down health care prices, this would undermine American leadership in medical innovation.<ref>Tyler Cowen, [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/05/business/05scene.html?_r=1&oref=slogin "Poor U.S Scores in Health Care Don’t Measure Nobels and Innovation"], The New York Times, October 5, 2006.</ref><ref>Julie Chan, [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=4664 "We're Number 37 in Health Care!"]</ref> It is argued that the high level of spending in the U.S health care system and its tolerance of waste is actually beneficial because it underpins American leadership in medical innovation, which is crucial not just for Americans, but for the entire world.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Kling   | first = Arnold   | author-link = Arnold Kling  | title = Two health-care documentaries | periodical = The Washington Times   | date = June 30, 2007   | postscript = <!--None-->   }}</ref>

Others point out that the American health care system spends more on state-of-the-art treatment for people who have good insurance, and spending is reduced on those lacking it<ref>Paul Krugman, Robin Wells, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 "The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It"]</ref> and question the costs and benefits of some medical innovations, noting, for example, that "rising spending on new medical technologies designed to address heart disease has not meant that more patients have survived."<ref>Maggie Mahar, [http://alternet.org/story/81142/?page=1 The Mythology of Boomers Bankrupting Our Healthcare System], Health Beat, April 10, 2008.</ref>

===Access===
One of the goals of socialized medicine systems is ensuring universal access to health care. Opponents of socialized medicine say that access for low-income individuals can be achieved by means other than socialized medicine, for example, income-related subsidies can function without public provision of either insurance or medical services.<ref>Patricia M. Danzon, [http://www.econlib.org/LIBRARY/Enc/HealthCareIndustry.html "Health Care Industry"], (The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics)</ref> Economist [[Milton Friedman]] said the role of the government in health care should be restricted to financing hard cases.<ref name="How to Cure Health Care"/> Universal coverage can also be achieved by making purchase of insurance compulsory. For example, European countries with socialized medicine in the broader sense, such as Germany and [[Health care in the Netherlands|Holland]], operate in this way. A legal obligation to purchase health insurance is akin to a mandated health tax, and the use of public subsidies is a form of directed [[income redistribution]] via the tax system. Such systems give the consumer a free choice amongst competing insurers whilst achieving universality to a government directed minimum standard.

Compulsory health insurance or savings are not limited to so-called socialized medicine, however. Singapore's health care system, which is often referred to as a free-market or mixed system, makes use of a combination of compulsory participation and state price controls to achieve the same goals.<ref name="Watson Wyatt Singapore">John Tucci, [http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850 "The Singapore health system – achieving positive health outcomes with low expenditure"], Watson Wyatt Healthcare Market Review, October 2004.</ref>

===Rationing (Access, Coverage, Price, and Time)===
{{See also|Healthcare rationing in the United States}}

Part of the current debate about [[health care in the United States]] revolves around whether the [[Affordable Care Act]] as part of [[health care reform in the United States|health care reform]] will result in a more systematic and logical allocation of health care. Opponents tend to believe that the law  will eventually result in a government takeover of health care and ultimately to socialized medicine and rationing based not on being able to afford the care you want but on whether a third party other than the patient and the doctor decides whether the procedure or the cost is justifiable. Supporters of reform point out that health care rationing already exists in the United States through insurance companies either denying coverage for pre-existing conditions or applying differential pricing for this coverage, or issuing denial for reimbursement on the grounds that the insurance company believes the procedure is experimental or will not assist even though the doctor has recommended it.<ref>[http://www.kmbc.com/r/6882159/detail.html Man Dies After Insurance Co.

Opponents of reform invoke the term socialized medicine because they say it will lead to health care rationing by denial of coverage, denial of access, and use of waiting lists, but often do so without acknowledging coverage denial, lack of access and waiting lists exist in the U.S. health care system currently<ref>"95,000+ U.S. patients are currently waiting for an organ transplant; nearly 4,000 new patients are added to the waiting list each month. Every day, 17 people die while waiting for a transplant of a vital organ, such as a heart, liver, kidney, pancreas, lung or bone marrow. Because of the lack of available donors in this country, 3,916 kidney patients, 1,570 liver patients, 356 heart patients and 245 lung patients died in 2006 while waiting for life-saving organ transplants:National Kidney Foundation http://www.kidney.org/news/newsroom/fs_new/25factsorgdon&trans.cfm</ref> or that waiting lists in the U.S. are sometimes longer than the waiting lists in countries with socialized medicine.<ref>"Right now more than 8,000 people in the UK need an organ transplant that could save or improve their life. But each year around 400 people die while waiting for a transplant". National Kidney Federation. http://www.kidney.org.uk/donor.html. (Note: The UK population is about one sixth the size of the U.S. population).</ref> Proponents of the reform proposal point out a public insurer is not akin to a socialized medicine system because it will have to negotiate rates with the medical industry just as other insurers do and cover its cost with premiums charged to policyholders just as other insurers do without any form of subsidy.

There is a frequent misunderstanding to think that waiting happens in places like England and Canada but does not happen in the United States. For instance it is not uncommon even for emergency cases in some U.S. hospitals to be boarded on beds in hallways for 48 hours or more due to lack of inpatient beds<ref>{{Cite web

Between 1993 and 2003, the total number of hospitals in the United States decreased by 703, the number of hospital beds dropped by 198,000, and the number of EDs fell by 425. The result has been serious overcrowding. If the beds in a hospital are filled, patients cannot be transferred from the ED to inpatient units. This can lead to the practice of “boarding” patients—holding them in the ED, often in beds in hallways, until an inpatient bed becomes available. It is not uncommon for patients in some busy EDs to be boarded for 48 hours or more."

</ref> and people in the U.S. rationed out by being unable to afford their care are simply never counted and may never receive the care they need, a factor that is often overlooked. Statistics about waiting times in national systems are an honest approach to the issue of those waiting for access to care.  Everyone waiting for care is reflected in the data which, in the UK for example, are used to inform debate, decision-making and research within Government and the wider community.<ref>[http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=1091 What does the Department of Health do? - Health Questions - NHS Direct<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/indicat/index_e.html Health Indicators<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>http://www.18weeks.nhs.uk/endwaiting/documents/EWCL_patient_LON_280907.pdf Setting new standards for your care: 2007 NHS patient leaflet on the 18 week maximum wait time promise for Dec 2008.</ref> Some people in the U.S are rationed out of care by unaffordable care or denial of access by HMOs and insurers or simply because they cannot afford co-pays or deductibles even if they have insurance.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/magazine/19healthcare-t.html?_r=3&pagewanted=all | title=Why we must Ration Health Care | work=[[New York Times]] | date= July 15, 2009 |quote=But if the stories ... lead us to think badly of the British system of rationing health care, we should remind ourselves that the U.S. system also results in people going without life-saving treatment&nbsp;— it just does so less visibly.

Opponents of the current reform care proposals fear that U.S. comparative effective research (a plan introduced in the stimulus bill) will be used to curtail spending and ration treatments, which is one function of [[NICE]], arguing that rationing by market pricing rather by government is the best way for care to be rationed. However, when defining any group scheme, the same rules must apply to everyone in the scheme so some coverage rules had to be established. Britain has a national budget for public funded health care, and recognises there has to be a logical trade off between spending on expensive treatments for some against, for example, caring for sick children.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/03/health/03nice.html?_r=3&hp=&pagewanted=all Quote "Britain’s National Health Service provides 95 percent of the nation’s care from an annual budget, so paying for costly treatments means less money for, say, sick children." from NY Times article Dec 2, 2008</ref> NICE is therefore applying the same market pricing principles to make the hard job of deciding between funding some treatments and not funding others on behalf of everyone in the insured pool. This rationing does not preclude choice of obtaining insurance coverage for excluded treatment as insured persons do having the choice to take out supplemental health insurance for drugs and treatments that the NHS does not cover (at least one private insurer offers such a plan) or from meeting treatment costs out-of-pocket.

The debate in the U.S. over rationing has enraged some in the UK and statements made by politicians such as Sarah Palin and Chuck Grassley resulted in a mass internet protest on web sites such as Twitter and Facebook under the banner title "WelovetheNHS" with positive stories of NHS experiences to counter the negative ones being expressed by these politicians and others and by certain media outlets such as Investors Business Daily and Fox News.<ref>http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/08/14/welove-thenhs-115875-21595748/The Mirror (UK newspaper) on public reaction and rage in UK to Palin, Grassley, IBD, and Fox (Hanan) interviews intended to denigrate the NHS</ref> In the UK, it is private health insurers that ration care (in the sense of not covering the most common services such as access to a primary care physician or excluding pre-existing conditions) rather than the NHS. Free access to a general practitioner is a core right in the NHS, but private insurers in the UK will not pay for payments to a private primary care physician.<ref name="ABI"/> Private insurers exclude many of the most common services as well as many of the most expensive treatments, whereas the vast majority of these are not excluded from the NHS but are obtainable at no cost to the patient. According to the [[Association of British Insurers]] (ABI), a typical policy will exclude the following: going to a general practitioner; going to Accident and Emergency ; drug abuse; HIV/AIDS; normal pregnancy; gender reassignment; mobility aids, such as wheelchairs; organ transplant; injuries arising from dangerous hobbies (often called hazardous pursuits); pre-existing conditions; dental services; outpatient drugs and dressings; deliberately self-inflicted injuries; infertility; cosmetic treatment; experimental or unproven treatment or drugs; war risks. Chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and end stage renal disease requiring dialysis are also excluded from coverage.<ref name="ABI">{{Cite web|url=http://www.abi.org.uk/Information/Consumers/Health_and_Protection/496.pdf|title=Are you buying private medical insurance?

Palin had alleged that America will create rationing "[[death panels]]" to decide whether old people could live or die, again widely taken to be a reference to NICE. U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley alleged that he was told that Senator Edward Kennedy would have been refused the brain tumor treatment he was receiving in the United States had he instead lived a country with government run health care. This, he alleged, would have been due to rationing because of Kennedy's age (77 years) and the high cost of treatment.<ref>Audio of Senator Grassly repeating allegation Sen Kennedy would not receive care in the UK on grounds of his age. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZK8ffUpL60</ref>  The UK Department of Health said that Grassley’s claims were “just wrong” and reiterated health service in England provides health care on the basis of clinical need regardless of age or ability to pay.

Some argue waiting lists result in great pain and suffering, but again evidence for this is unclear. In a recent survey of patients admitted to hospital in the UK from a waiting list or by planned appointment, only 10% reported they felt they should have been admitted sooner than they were. 72% reported the admission was as timely as they felt necessary.<ref>http://www.healthcarecommission.org.uk/_db/_documents/Full_2007_results_with_historical_comparisons_-_tables.doc Heathcare Commission: 'Survey of adult inpatients in the NHS 2007'</ref> Medical facilities in the U.S do not report waiting times in national statistics as is done in other countries and it is a myth to believe there is no waiting for care in the U.S. Some argue wait times in the U.S could actually be as long as or longer than in other countries with universal health care.<ref>http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_28/b4042072.htm Business Week: The doctor will see you in 3 months</ref>

There is considerable argument about whether any of the health bills currently before congress will introduce rationing. Howard Dean for example contested in an interview that they do not. However, Politico has pointed out that all health systems contain elements of rationing (such as coverage rules) and the public health care plan will therefore implicitly involve some element of rationing.<ref name=scott/><ref name=dean>{{Cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/25/howard-dean/rationing-health-care-reform/|title=There's rationing in health care now, and there still would be under reform bill|publisher=[[PolitiFact]]|accessdate=September 7, 2009}}</ref>

===Political interference and targeting===
In the UK, where most health care is delivered by government employees or government employed sub-contractors, political interference is quite hard to discern. Most supply side decisions are in practice under the control of medical practitioners and boards comprising the medical profession. There is some antipathy towards the target-setting by politicians in the UK. Even the NICE criteria for public funding of medical treatments were never set by politicians. Nevertheless politicians have set targets, for instance to reduce waiting times and improve choice.  Academics have pointed out that the claims of success of the targeting are statistically flawed.<ref>[http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/press/press_release_pdfs/A&E%20waiting%20targets%20-%20Les%20Mayhew.pdf Cass Business School: Academics challenge A&E waiting times]</ref> The veracity and significance of the claims of targeting interfering with clinical priorities are often hard to judge. For example, some UK ambulance crews have complained that hospitals were deliberately leaving patients with ambulance crews to prevent an Accident and Emergency department (A&E, or emergency room) target time for treatment from starting to run. The Department of Health vehemently denied the claim, because the A&E time begins when the ambulance arrives at the hospital and not after the handover. It defended the A&E target by pointing out that the percentage of people waiting 4 hours or more in A&E had dropped from just under 25 percent in 2004 to less than 2 percent in 2008.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7249514.stm BBC News:Anger at 'patient stacking' claim]</ref> The original Observer article reported that in London, 14,700 ambulance turnarounds were longer than an hour and 332 were more than 2 hours when the target turnaround time is 15 minutes.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2008/feb/17/health.nhs1 copy of original Observer story from Guardian website]</ref> However, in the context of the total number of emergency ambulance attendances by the London Ambulance Service each year (approximately 865,000),<ref>[http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/publications/areport/London%20Ambulance%20Service%20AR%2006-07.pdf http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/publications/areport/London%20Ambulance%20Service%20AR%2006-07.pdf]</ref> these represent just 1.6% and 0.03% of all ambulance calls. The proportion of these that attributable to patients left with ambulance crews is not recorded. At least one junior doctor has complained that the 4-hour A&E target is too high and leads to unwarranted actions that are not in the best interests of patients.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4631793.stm | work=BBC News | title=Minister blasted over A&E target | date=June 28, 2005 | accessdate=May 23, 2010 | first=Nick | last=Triggle}}</ref>

Political targeting of waiting times in England has had dramatic effects. The [[National Health Service]] reports that the median admission wait time for elective inpatient treatment (non-urgent hospital treatment) in England at the end of August 2007, was just under 6 weeks, and 87.5 per cent of patients were admitted within 13 weeks. Reported waiting times in England also overstate the true waiting time. This is because the clock starts ticking when the patient has been referred to a specialist by the GP and it only stops when the medical procedure is completed. The 18 week maximum waiting period target thus includes all the times taken for the patient to attend the first appointment with the specialist, any tests called for by the specialist to determine precisely the root of the patient's problem and the best way to treat it. It excludes time for any intervening steps deemed necessary prior to treatment, such as recovery from some other illness or the losing of excessive weight.<ref>http://www.18weeks.nhs.uk/Content.aspx?path=/What-is-18-weeks/patient 18 week NHS target</ref>
