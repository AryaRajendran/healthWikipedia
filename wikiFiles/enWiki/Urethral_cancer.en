* Having a history of [[bladder cancer]].
* Having conditions that cause chronic, swollen, reddened part in the urethra.
* Being 60 or older.
* Being a white female.

== Diagnosis ==
In male urethral cancer, diagnosis is established by transurethral biopsy. In women the diagnosis is established in much the same way.  Types of urethral cancer include [[transitional cell carcinoma]], [[squamous cell carcinoma]], [[adenocarcinoma]], and [[melanoma]].

== Treatment ==
{{Prose|section|date=March 2009}}
Surgery is the most common treatment for cancer of the urethra. One of the following types of surgery may be done:
* Open excision surgery.
* Electro-resection with flash surgery.
* [[Laser surgery]].
* [[Cystourethrectomy]] surgery.
* [[Cystoprostatectomy]] surgery.
* Anterior body cavity surgery.
* Incomplete or basic [[penectomy]] surgery.

Chemotherapy as a form of Urethral Cancer Treatment

Chemotherapy involves using drugs to destroy urethral cancer cells. It is a systemic [http://www.urethralcancer.net urethral cancer] treatment (i.e., destroys urethral cancer cells throughout the body) that is administered orally or intravenously (through a vein; IV). Medications are often used in combination to destroy urethral cancer that has metastasized. Commonly used drugs include cisplatin (Platinol®), vincristine (Oncovin®), and methotrexate (Trexall®).

Side effects include the following:

Anemia (causing fatigue, weakness) 
Nausea and vomiting 
Loss of appetite (anorexia) 
Hair loss (alopecia) 
Mouth sores 
Increased risk for infection 
Shortness of breath 
Excessive bleeding and bruising
