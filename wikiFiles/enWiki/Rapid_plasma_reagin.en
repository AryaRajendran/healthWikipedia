'''Rapid Plasma Reagin''' (RPR) refers to a type of test that looks for non-specific [[antibody|antibodies]] in the blood of the patient that may indicate that the organism (''[[Treponema pallidum]]'') that causes [[syphilis]] is present.  The term "reagin" means that this test does not look for antibodies against the actual bacterium, but rather for antibodies against substances released by cells when they are damaged by ''T. pallidum''.  

In addition to screening for syphilis, an RPR level (also called a "[[titer]]") can be used to track the progress of the disease over time and its response to therapy.

==Accuracy==
The RPR test is an effective [[screening test]], as it is very good at detecting people without symptoms who are affected by syphilis. However the test may suggest that people have syphilis who in reality do not (i.e., it may produce [[false positive]]s). False positives can be seen in viral infections ([[Epstein-Barr]], [[hepatitis]], [[varicella]], [[measles]]), [[lymphoma]], [[tuberculosis]], [[malaria]], [[endocarditis]], [[connective tissue disease]], [[pregnancy]], [[autoimmune diseases]], intravenous drug abuse, or contamination. It can also occur naturally in the elderly.<ref name=RedBookSyphilis>{{cite book|editor-first=Larry K. |editor-last=Pickering |title=Red Book: 2006 Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases | chapter=Syphilis |isbn=1581101945 | publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics | year=2006 | pages=631–644 |oclc=70819143}}</ref> As a result, these two screening tests should always be followed up by a more specific treponemal test. Tests based on [[monoclonal antibodies]] and [[immunofluorescence]], including ''Treponema pallidum'' hemagglutination assay ([[TPHA]]) and Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption ([[FTA-ABS]]) are more specific and more expensive. Unfortunately, false positives can still occur in related treponomal infections such as [[yaws]] and [[Pinta (disease)|pinta]]. Tests based on enzyme-linked immunoassays are also used to confirm the results of simpler screening tests for syphilis.

==Alternatives==
Another test often used to screen for syphilis is the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [[Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test|VDRL]] slide test. However, the RPR test is generally preferred due to its ease of use.

Other types of tests are currently being evaluated as possible alternatives to, or as replacements for, the rapid plasma reagin test.  One of these alternatives is an immunochromatographic strip test.  A study published in February 2006<ref>{{cite journal |author=Montoya PJ, Lukehart SA, Brentlinger PE, ''et al.'' |title=Comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid immunochromatographic test and the rapid plasma reagin test for antenatal syphilis screening in Mozambique |journal=Bull.

Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption Test is the most specific test for syphilis. If this is positive it confirms the diagnosis.
