The '''submasseterric space''' (also termed the '''masseteric space''') is a [[fascial spaces of the head and neck|fascial space of the head and neck]] (sometimes also termed [[fascia]]l spaces or tissue spaces). It is a [[potential space]] in the face over the angle of the jaw, and is paired on each side. It is located between the lateral aspect of the mandible and the medial aspect of the [[masseter muscle]] and its [[masseteric fascia|investing fascia]]. The term is derived from [[wikt:sub-|sub-]] meaning "under" in Latin and ''masseteric'' which refers to the masseter muscle. The submasseteric space is one of the four [[compartment (anatomy)|compartment]]s of the [[masticator space]].<ref name="Hupp 2008">{{cite book|last=Hupp JR, Ellis E, Tucker MR|title=Contemporary oral and maxillofacial surgery|year=2008|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=9780323049030|pages=317–333|edition=5th ed.}}</ref> Sometimes the submasseteric space is described as a series of spaces, created because the masseter muscle has multiple insertions that cover most of the lateral surface of the [[ramus of the mandible]].

==Location and structure==
[[File:Masticator space.png|thumbnail|left|The four compartents of the right masticator space. '''A''' Temporalis muscle, '''B''' Masseter muscle, '''C''' Lateral pterygoid muscle, '''D''' Medial ptaerygoid muscle, '''E''' Superficial temporal space, '''F''' Deep temporal space, '''G''' Submasseteric space, '''H''' Pterygomandibular space, '''I''' Approximate location of infratemporal space.]]
===Anatomic boundaries===
The boundaries of each buccal space are:
* the anterior margin of the masseter muscle anteriorly,
* the [[parotid gland]] posteriorly,<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> 
* the zygomatic arch superiorly,<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> 
* the inferior border of the mandible inferiorly,<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> 
* the lateral surface of the mandibular ramus medially (the submasseteric space is superficial to the mandible),<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> 
* the masseter muscle laterally (the submasseteric space is deep to masseter).<ref name="Hupp 2008" />

===Communications===
The communications of each submasseteric space are:
* to the [[buccal space]] anteriorly,
* to the [[pterygomandibular space]] (around the posterior margin of the mandibular ramus to its medial surface) and the [[parotid space]] posteriorly,
* to the [[superficial temporal space]] superiorly.

===Contents===
In health, the space contains:
* the [[masseteric artery]] and vein.<ref name="Hupp 2008" />

==Clinical relevance==
Submasseteric abscesses are relatively rare, and may be confused with a [[parotid abscess]] or [[parotitis]].<ref name="Rai 2011">{{cite journal|last=Rai|first=Ashutosh|coauthors=Rajput, Ruchi; Khatua, RabindraK; Singh, Mangal|title=Submasseteric abscess: A rare head and neck abscess|journal=Indian Journal of Dental Research|date=1 January 2011|volume=22|issue=1|pages=166|doi=10.4103/0970-9290.79990|pmid=21525699}}</ref> They tend to be chronic.<ref name="Jones 2003">{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=KC|coauthors=Silver, J; Millar, WS; Mandel, L|title=Chronic submasseteric abscess: anatomic, radiologic, and pathologic features.|journal=AJNR.

===Odontogenic infections===
The submasseteric space is sometimes involved by the spread of [[odontogenic infection]]s, such as a [[pericoronal abscess]] associated with an [[tooth impaction|impacted]] [[mandibular third molar]] (lower wisdom tooth) when the apices of the tooth lie very close to or within the space.<ref name="Hargreaves 2010">{{cite book|last=Hargreaves KM, Cohen S (editors), Berman LH (web editor)|title=Cohen's pathways of the pulp|year=2010|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=978-0-323-06489-7|pages=590–594|edition=10th}}</ref>
