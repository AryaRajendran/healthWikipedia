'''Alcoholic polyneuropathy''' is a [[neurological disorder]] in which multiple peripheral [[nerve|nerves]] throughout the body [[polyneuropathy|malfunction simultaneously]]. It is defined by [[axon|axonal]] degeneration in [[neuron]]s of both the [[sensory system|sensory]] and [[motor system|motor systems]] and initially occurs at the [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Proximal_and_distal|distal]] ends of the longest axons in the [[body]]. This [[nerve injury|nerve damage]] causes an individual to experience pain and motor weakness, first in the feet and hands and then progressing centrally. Alcoholic polyneuropathy is caused primarily by [[Alcoholism|chronic alcoholism]]; however, [[Avitaminosis|vitamin deficiencies]] are also known to contribute to its development. This [[disease]] typically occurs in chronic alcoholics who have some sort of nutritional deficiency. Treatment may involve abstaining from alcohol, nutritional supplementation, and pain management. 

==Signs and symptoms==
Alcoholic polyneuropathy usually has a gradual onset over months or even years although axonal degeneration often begins before an individual experiences any [[symptom|symptoms]].<ref name="mawdsley"/> An early warning sign ([[prodrome]]) of the possibility of developing alcoholic polyneuropathy, specially in a chronic alcoholic, would be weight loss because this usually signifies a nutritional deficiency that can lead to the development of the disease.<ref name="brown"/>

The disease typically involves sensory and motor loss, as well as painful physical perceptions ([[paresthesia]]s), though all [[Sensory_system#Modality|sensory modalities]] may be involved.<ref name="laker"/> The symptoms affecting the sensory and motor systems seem to develop in a symmetrical pattern; for example, if the right foot is affected, the left foot will be affected simultaneously or soon thereafter as well.<ref name="brown"/> In most cases the legs are affected first, followed by the arms. The hands usually become involved when the symptoms reach above the ankle level.<ref name="laker"/> This is called a stocking-and-glove pattern of sensory disturbances.<ref name="lisak"/>

The polyneuropathy that develops spans a large range of severity. Some cases are seemingly [[asymptomatic]] and may only be recognized upon careful examination. The most severe cases may result in profound [[physical disability]].<ref name="brown"/>

===Sensory===
Common manifestations of sensory issues include numbness or painful sensations in the arms and legs, abnormal sensations like “pins and needles,” and [[heat intolerance]].<ref name="medline"/> [[Pain]] experienced by individuals depends on the severity of the polyneuropathy. It may be dull and constant in some individuals while being sharp and lancinating in others.<ref name="lisak"/> In many subjects, tenderness is seen upon the palpitation of muscles in the feet and legs.<ref name="brown"/> Certain people may also feel [[cramp]]ing sensations in the muscles affected and others say there is a burning sensation in their feet and calves.<ref name="lisak"/>

===Motor===
Sensory symptoms are gradually followed by motor symptoms.<ref name="laker"/> Motor symptoms may include muscle cramps and weakness, [[erectile dysfunction]] in men, problems urinating, [[constipation]], and [[diarrhea]].<ref name="laker"/> Individuals also may experience muscle wasting and decreased or absent [[deep tendon reflex]]es.<ref name="brown"/> Some people may experience frequent falls and gait unsteadiness due to [[ataxia]]. This ataxia may be caused by [[cerebellar]] degeneration, sensory ataxia, or distal muscle weakness.<ref name="lisak"/> Over time, alcoholic polyneuropathy may also cause difficulty swallowing ([[dysphagia]]), speech impairment ([[disarthria]]), [[muscle spasms]], and [[muscle atrophy]].<ref name="medline"/>

In addition to alcoholic polyneuropathy, the individual may also show other related disorders such as [[Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome]] and cerebellar degeneration that result from alcoholism-related nutritional disorders.<ref name="brown"/>

==Causes==
The general cause of this disease is prolonged and heavy consumption of [[Alcoholic_beverage|alcohol]] accompanied by a nutritional deficiency. There is some debate over whether the main cause is the direct [[toxicity|toxic]] effect of alcohol itself or whether the disease is a result alcoholism-related [[malnutrition]].<ref name="brown"/>

Frequently alcoholics have disrupted social links in their lives and have an irregular lifestyle. This may cause an alcoholic to change his eating habits including more missed meals and a poor dietary balance.<ref name ="preedy"/> Alcoholism may also result in loss of [[appetite]], alcoholic [[gastritis]], and vomiting, which decrease food intake. Alcohol abuse damages the lining of the [[gastrointestinal system]] and reduces absorption of nutrients that are taken in.<ref name="Vittadini">{{cite journal|author=Vittadini G, Buonocore M, Colli G, Terzi M, Fonte R, and Biscaldi G|title=Alcoholic Polyneuropathy: A Clinical and Epidemiological Study|journal=Oxford Journals|year=2001|volume=36|issue=5|pages=393–400}}</ref> The combination of all of them may result in a nutritional deficiency that is linked to the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy.<ref name ="preedy">{{cite book |author=Preedy, Victor R.; Watson, Ronald R. |title=Nutrition and alcohol: linking nutrient interactions and dietary intake |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |year=2004 |pages= 7–13|isbn=0-8493-1680-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> 

There is evidence that providing individuals with adequate vitamins improves symptoms despite continued alcohol intake, indicating that vitamin deficiency may be a major factor in the development and progression of alcoholic polyneuropathy.<ref name="mawdsley">{{cite journal|last=Mawdsley C and Mayer RF|title=Nerve Conduction in Alcoholic Polyneuropathy|journal=Brain; a journal of neurology|year=1965|volume=88|issue=2|pages=335–356|doi=10.1093/brain/88.2.335|first1=C.|last2=Mayer|first2=R. F.}}</ref> In [[model organisms|experimental models]] of alcoholic polyneuropathy utilizing [[brown rat|rats]] and monkeys has not resulted in convincing evidence that proper nutritional intake along with alcohol results in polyneuropathy.<ref name="brown"/>

In addition, the consumption of alcohol may lead to the build up of certain toxins in the body. For example, in the process of breaking down alcohol, the body produces [[acetaldehyde]], which can accumulate to toxic levels in alcoholics. This suggests that there is a possibility [[ethanol]] (or its metabolites) may cause alcoholic polyneuropathy.<ref name="lisak"/> There is evidence that polyneuropathy is also prevalent in well nourished alcoholics, supporting the idea that there is a direct toxic effect of alcohol. 

Many of the studies conducted that observe alcoholic polyneuropathy in patients are often criticized for their criteria used to assess nutritional deficiency in the subjects because they may not have completely ruled out the possibility of a nutritional deficiency in the genesis of the polyneuropathy.<ref name="brown"/> Many researchers favor the nutritional origin of this disease, but the possibility of alcohol having a toxic effect on the peripheral nerves has not been completely ruled out.<ref name="brown"/>

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Thiamine pyrophosphate.png|thumb|[[Thiamine pyrophosphate]] structure. As a result of nutritional deficiency in those with alcoholic polyneuropathy, low thiamine levels are usually present and have been proposed as a cause of the nerve destruction.]]
The [[pathophysiology]] of alcoholic polyneuropathy is an area of current research. Damage to the nervous system takes place before symptoms appear in individuals, beginning with segmental thinning and loss of [[myelin]] on the peripheral ends of the longest nerves. Segmental thinning is the demyelination of axons in small sections at a time. This occurrence increases leakage of an action potential current down the axon, so it is weakest at the peripheral end. Decrease in current causes further thinning of myelin.<ref name="mawdsley"/>

In most cases, individuals with alcoholic polyneuropathy have some degree of nutritional deficiency. Alcohol, a [[carbohydrate]], increases the [[metabolic]] demand for [[thiamine]] (vitamin B1) because of its role in the [[carbohydrate metabolism|metabolism of glucose]]. Thiamine levels are usually low in alcoholics due to their decreased nutritional intake. In addition, alcohol interferes with intestinal absorption of thiamine, thereby further decreasing thiamine levels in the body.<ref name="mendell"/> Thiamine is important in three reactions in the [[carbohydrate metabolism|metabolism of glucose]]: the [[decarboxylation]] of [[pyruvic acid]], d-ketoglutaric acid, and [[transketolase]]. A lack of thiamine in the cells may therefore prevent neurons from maintaining necessary [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) levels as a result of impaired [[glycolosis]]. Thiamine deficiency alone could explain the impaired nerve [[Electrical conductance|conduction]] in those with alcoholic polyneuropathy, but other factors likely play a part.<ref name="mawdsley"/>

The metabolic effects of liver damage associated with alcoholism may also contribute to the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. Normal products of the liver, such as [[lipoic acid]], may be deficient in alcoholics. This deficiency would also disrupt glycolosis and alter metabolism, transport, storage, and activation of essential nutrients.<ref name="mawdsley"/>

The malnutrition many alcoholics suffer deprives them of important [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] for the oxidative metabolism of glucose. Neural tissues depend on this process for energy, and disruption of the cycle would impair cell growth and function. [[Schwann cells]] produce myelin that wraps around the sensory and motor nerve axons to enhance [[action potential]] conduction in the periphery. An energy deficiency in Schwann cells would account for the disappearance of myelin on peripheral nerves, which may result in damage to axons or loss of nerve function altogether. In peripheral nerves, oxidative enzyme activity is most concentrated around the [[nodes of Ranvier]], making these locations most vulnerable to cofactor deprivation. Lacking essential cofactors reduces myelin impedance, increases current leakage, and slows signal transmission. Disruptions in conductance first affect the peripheral ends of the longest and largest peripheral nerve fibers because they suffer most from decreased action potential propagation. Thus, neural deterioration occurs in an accelerating cycle: myelin damage reduces conductance, and reduced conductance contributes to myelin degradation. The slowed conduction of action potentials in axons causes segmental demyelination extending proximally; this is also known as retrograde [[degeneration (medical)|degeneration]]. <ref name="mawdsley"/>

[[Acetaldehyde]] has been shown to be toxic to peripheral nerves. There are increased levels of acetaldehyde produced during [[ethanol]] metabolism. If the acetaldehyde is not metabolized quickly the nerves may be affected by the accumulation of acetaldehyde to toxic levels.<ref name="lisak"/><ref name="koike"/>

==Diagnosis==
Alcoholic polyneuropathy is very similar to other [[neurodegeneration|axonal degenerative]] polyneuropathies and therefore can be difficult to diagnose. When alcoholics have sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a nutritional deficiency, a diagnosis of alcoholic polyneuropathy is often reached.<ref name="brown"></ref><ref name=shields>{{cite journal|last=Shields, Jr.|first=RW|title=Alcoholic Polyneuropathy|journal=Muscle & Nerve|year=1985|month=Mar/Apr|volume=8|pages=183–187|doi=10.1002/mus.880080302|issue=3}}</ref> 

In order to confirm the diagnosis, it is necessary to rule out other causes of similar clinical syndromes. Other neuropathies can be [[Differential diagnosis|differentiated]] on the basis of typical clinical or laboratory features.<ref name="shields"/> Differential diagnoses to alcoholic polyneuropathy include [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], [[beriberi]], [[Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease]], [[plexopathy|diabetic lumbosacral plexopathy]], [[diabetic neuropathy]], [[mononeuritis multiplex]] and [[post-polio syndrome]].<ref name=laker>{{cite web|last=Laker, SR, Sullivan, WJ|title=Alcoholic Neuropathy|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/315159-overview|work=eMedicine|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=18 March 2011}}</ref>

To clarify the diagnosis, medical workup most commonly involves laboratory tests, though, in some cases, [[medical imaging|imaging]], [[nerve conduction study|nerve conduction studies]], [[electromyography]], and vibrometer testing may also be used.<ref name="laker"/>

A number of tests may be used to rule out other causes of peripheral neuropathy.  One of the first presenting symptoms of [[diabetes mellitus]] may be peripheral neuropathy, and [[hemoglobin A1C]] can be used to estimate average [[blood sugar|blood glucose levels]].  Elevated blood [[creatinine]] levels may indicate [[kidney|renal]] insufficiency and may also be a cause of peripheral neuropathy.  A heavy metal toxicity screen should also be used to exclude [[lead toxicity]] as a cause of neuropathy.<ref name="laker"/>

Alcoholism is normally associated with nutritional deficiencies, which may contribute to the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. [[Thiamine]], [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B-12]], and [[folic acid]] are vitamins that play an essential role in the [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] and [[central nervous system]] and should be among the first analyzed in laboratory tests.<ref name="laker"/> It has been difficult to assess thiamine status in individuals due to difficulties in developing a method to directly [[assay]] thiamine in the blood and urine.<ref name="brown"/> A [[liver function test]] may also be ordered, as alcoholic consumption may cause an increase in liver enzyme levels.<ref name="laker"/>

==Management==
Although there is no known cure for alcoholic polyneuropathy, there are a number of treatments that can control symptoms and promote independence.  [[Physical therapy]] is beneficial for strength training of weakened muscles, as well as for gait and balance training.<ref name="laker"/>

===Nutrition===
[[File:Tpn 3bag.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A home [[parenteral nutrition]] formula to be taken [[intravenous therapy|intravenously]] may be a part of the treatment plan for those with alcoholic polyneuropathy who also suffer from a nutritional deficiency.]]
In order to best manage symptoms of the person with the disease, refraining from consuming alcohol is essential. Abstinence from alcohol will encourage proper consumption of nutrients and prevent progression or recurrence of the neuropathy.<ref name="shields"/> Once an individual stops consuming alcohol it is important to make sure they understand that substantial recovery will usually not be seen for a few months. Some subjective improvement may be seen right away, but this is usually due to the overall benefits of alcohol detoxification.<ref name="mendell">{{cite book |author=Cornblath, David R.; Jerry R. Mendell; Kissel, John T. |title=Diagnosis and management of peripheral nerve disorders |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2001 |pages=332–334 |isbn=0-19-513301-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  If alcohol consumption continues, vitamin supplementation alone is not enough to improve the symptoms of most individuals.<ref name="lisak"/> 

Nutritional therapy with [[parenteral]] multivitamins is beneficial to implement until the person can maintain adequate nutritional intake.<ref name="brown"/> Treatments also include [[vitamin]] supplementation (especially [[thiamine]]). In more severe cases of nutritional deficiency 320 mg/day of [[benfotiamine]] for 4 weeks followed by 120 mg/day for 4 more weeks may be prescribed in an effort to return thiamine levels to normal.<ref name="lisak"/>

===Pain===

Painful [[dysesthesias]] caused by alcoholic polyneuropathy can be treated by using [[gabapentin]] or [[amitriptyline]] in combination with over-the-counter pain medications, such as [[aspirin]], [[ibuprofen]], or [[acetaminophen]]. [[Tricyclic antidepressants]] such as [[phenytoin]], [[amitriptyline]], or [[carbamazepine]] may help stabbing pains and have central and peripheral [[anticholinergic]] and [[sedative|sedative effects]]. These agents have central effects on pain transmission and block the active reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.<ref name="laker"/><ref name="medline"/>

[[Anticonvulsant|Anticonvulsant drugs]] like [[gabapentin]] block the active reuptake of [[norepinephrine]] and [[serotonin]] and have properties that relieve neuropathic pain.  However, these drugs take a few weeks to become effective and are rarely used in the treatment of [[pain|acute pain]].<ref name="laker"/>

[[analgesics|Topical analgesics]] like [[capsaicin]] may also relieve minor aches and pains of muscles and joints.<ref name="laker"/>

==Prognosis==
It is difficult to assess the [[prognosis]] of a patient because it is hard to convince chronic alcoholics to abstain from drinking alcohol completely. It has been shown that a good prognosis may be given for mild neuropathy if the alcoholic has abstained from drinking for 3-5 years.<ref name="koike">{{cite journal|last=Koike H and Sobue G|title=Alcoholic Neuropathy|journal=Current Opinion in Neurology|year=2006|volume=19|issue=5|pages=481–486|issn=1350-7540|doi=10.1097/01.wco.0000245371.89941.eb|pmid=16969158|first1=H|last2=Sobue|first2=G}}</ref> During the early stages of the disease the damage appears to be reversible when people are given adequate amounts of vitamins, such as thiamine.<ref name="mawdsley"/> If the polyneuropathy is mild, the individual will normally experience a significant improvement in the symptoms they experience and may be completely eliminated within weeks to months after proper nutrition has been maintained.<ref name="brown"/> When those people diagnosed with alcohol polyneuropathy experience a recovery it is presumed to be a result of regeneration and collateral sprouting of the damaged axons.<ref name="lisak"/>

As the disease progresses, the damage may become permanent. In severe cases of thiamine deficiency, a few of the positive symptoms (including neuropathic pain) may persist indefinitely.<ref name="koike"/> Even after the restoration of a balanced nutritional intake, those patients with severe or chronic polyneuropathy may experience lifelong residual symptoms.<ref name="brown"/> Alcoholic polyneuropathy is not life threatening but may significantly affect one's quality of life. Effects of the disease range from mild discomfort to severe disability.<ref name="medline">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000714.htm |title=Alcoholic Polyneuropathy |author=MedlinePlus |coauthors=National Library of Medicine |date=20 February 2011 |publisher=National Institute of Health }}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
[[File:Alcohol by Country.png|thumb|right|Total recorded alcohol consumption per capita of individuals 15 years or older, in liters of pure alcohol. Alcoholism is the main cause of alcoholic polyneuropathy.]]
The rate of incidence of alcoholic polyneuropathy involving sensory and motor polyneuropathy varies from 10% to 50% of alcoholics depending on the subject selection and diagnostic criteria. If electrodiagnostic criteria is used, alcoholic polyneuropathy may be found in up to 90% of individuals being assessed.<ref name="lisak">{{cite book |author=Roongroj Bhidayasiri; Lisak, Robert P.; Daniel Truong; Carroll, William K. |title=International Neurology |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location= |year=2009 |pages= 413–414 |isbn=1-4051-5738-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> The distribution and severity the disease depends on regional dietary habits, individual drinking habits, as well as an individual’s [[genetics]].<ref name="koike"/> Large studies have been conducted and show that alcoholic polyneuropathy severity and incidence correlates best with the total lifetime consumption of alcohol. Factors such as nutritional intake, age, or other medical conditions are correlate in lesser degrees.<ref name="mendell"/> For unknown reasons, alcoholic polyneuropathy has a high incidence in women.<ref name="lisak"/>

Certain alcoholic beverages can also contain [[Congener (alcohol)|congeners]] that may also be bioactive; therefore, the consumption of varying alcoholic beverages may result in different health consequences.<ref name="koike"/> An individual’s nutritional intake also plays a role in the development of this disease. Depending on the specific dietary habits, they may have a deficiency of one or more of the following: thiamine (vitamin B1), [[pyridoxine]] (vitamin B6), [[pantothenic acid]] and [[biotin]], [[vitamin B12]], folic acid, [[niacin|niacin (vitamin B3)]], and [[vitamin A]].<ref name="medline"/>

===Acetaldehyde===
[[File:Ethanol to acetaldehyde.jpg|thumb|Conversion of [[ethanol]] to [[acetaldehyde]]. The toxic buildup of acetaldehyde may result in alcoholic polyneuropathy.]]
{{Main|Acetaldehyde}}

It is also thought there is perhaps a genetic predisposition for some alcoholics that results in increased frequency of alcoholic polyneuropathy in certain ethnic groups. During the body’s processing of alcohol, ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde mainly by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]]; acetaldehyde is then oxidized to acetate mainly by [[aldehyde dehydrogenase|aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)]]. [[ALDH2]] is an isozyme of ALDH and ALDH2 has a polymorphism (ALDH2*2, Glu487Lys) that makes ADLH2 inactive; this allele is more prevalent among Southeast and East Asians and results in a failure to quickly metabolize acetaldehyde. The neurotoxicity resulting from the accumulation of acetaldehyde may play a role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic polyneuropathy.<ref name="koike"/><ref name="lisak"/>

==History==
[[File:Johncoakleylettsome.jpeg|thumb|upright|right|[[John C. Lettsome]] noted in 1787 [[hyperesthesia]] and [[paralysis]] in legs more than arms of patients, a characteristic of alcoholic polyneuropathy.]]
The first description of [[symptom]]s associated with alcoholic polyneuropathy were recorded by [[John C. Lettsome]] in 1787 when he noted [[hyperesthesia]] and [[paralysis]] in legs more than arms of patients.<ref name="mawdsley"/> Jackson has also been credited with describing polyneuropathy in chronic alcoholics in 1822. The clinical title of alcoholic polyneuropathy was widely recognized by the late nineteenth century. It was thought that the polyneuropathy was a direct result of the toxic effect alcohol had on peripheral nerves when used excessively. In 1928, George C. Shattuck argued that the polyneuropathy resulted from a vitamin B deficiency commonly found in alcoholics and he claimed that alcoholic polyneuropathy should be related to [[beriberi]]. This debate continues today over what exactly causes this disease, some argue it is just the alcohol toxicity, others claim the vitamin deficiencies are to blame and still others say it is some combination of the two.<ref name=brown>{{cite book |author=Aminoff, Michael J.; Brown, William A.; Bolton, Charles Francis |title=Neuromuscular function and disease: basic, clinical and electrodiagnostic aspects |publisher=W. B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2002 |pages=1112–1115 |isbn=0-7216-8922-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Research directions==
The mechanism of axonal degeneration has not been clarified and is an area of continuing research on alcoholic polyneuropathy.<ref name="koike"/>

Further research is looking at the effect an alcoholics’ consumption and choice of alcoholic beverage on their development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. Some beverages may include more nutrients than others (such as thiamine), but the effects of this with regards to helping with a nutritional deficiency in alcoholics is yet unknown.<ref name="Vittadini"/>

There is still controversy about the reasons for the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. Some argue it is a direct result of alcohol's toxic effect on the nerves, but others say factors such as a nutritional deficiency or chronic liver disease may play a role in the development as well. This debate is ongoing and research is continuing in an effort to discover the real cause of alcoholic polyneuropathy.<ref name="mendell"/>
