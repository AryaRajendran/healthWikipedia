'''Emergency ultrasound''' is the application of [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] at the [[point of care]] to make immediate patient-care decisions. It is performed by the health care professional caring for the injured persons. This point-of-care use of ultrasound is often to evaluate an emergent medical condition, in settings such as an [[emergency department]], critical care unit, ambulance, or combat zone.<ref>ACEP Policy Statement: Emergency Ultrasound Guidelines.

Point of care ultrasound has been used in a wide variety of specialties and has increased in use in the last decade as ultrasound machines have become more compact and portable.<ref>Levin DC, Rao VM, Parker L, Frangos AJ. Noncardiac point-of-care ultrasound by non-radiologist physicians: How widespread is it?. JACR 2011; 8(11):772-775.</ref> It is now used for a variety of exams in various clinical settings at the person's bedside. In the emergency setting, it is used to guide resuscitation and monitor critically ill persons, provide procedural guidance for improved safety and confirm clinical diagnosis.

==Scope==

===Resuscitation of the critically ill===

Point of care ultrasound is sometimes the only option in the evaluation of injured persons who are too ill for transport to other imaging modalities (i.e. [[X-ray computed tomography|computed tomography]], or CT scan) or whose illness is so acute that medical decisions in their care need to be made in seconds to minutes. It is also increasingly used to guide and triage care in resource-limited situations, in rural or medically underserved areas.<ref>Dean AJ, Ku BS, Zeserson EM. The utility of handheld ultrasound in an austere medical setting in Guatemala after a natural disaster. Am J Disaster Med. 2007;2(5):249–256.</ref>

In people who present with a traumatic injury, The [[focused assessment with sonography for trauma]] or FAST exam is used to assess [[hypotension|hypotensive]] person for occult bleeding. Traditionally used by emergency physicians and surgeons treating trauma persons, it has also been used by paramedics<ref>Walcher F, Weinlich M, Conrad G, Schweigkofler U, Breitkreutz R, Kirshning T. Marzi I. Prehospital ultrasound imaging improves management of abdominal trauma. Br J Surg 2006;93(2): 238-42.</ref> in combat zones,<ref name="Beck-Razi"/> and for non-traumatic problems such as ruptured [[ectopic pregnancy]]. Similarly, emergency ultrasound can also evaluate the lungs for [[hemothorax]] (bleeding in the chest), and [[pneumothorax]] (a puncture resulting in air trapped in the chest and lung collapse).

People presenting with [[hypotension]] of unknown cause, ultrasound has been utilized to determine the cause of [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].<ref>Rose JS et al. The UHP Ultrasound Protocol: A Novel Ultrasound Approach to the Empiric Evaluation of the Undifferentiated Hypotensive Patient. AJEM; 19(4):299-301.</ref><ref>Jones AE et al.

Critical Care Med. 2004;32(8):1703-1708.</ref> Evaluation of the heart and [[inferior vena cava]] (IVC) can help the clinician at the bedside choose important treatments and monitor the response to the interventions.<ref name="Labovitz focused cardiac">Labovitz AJ et al. Focused Cardiac Ultrasound in the Emergent Setting: A Consensus Statement of the American College of Emergency Physicians. JASE 2010; 23(12):1225-1230.</ref><ref name="Hernandez">Hernandez C et al. C.A.U.S.E.:Cardiac arrest ultrasound exam—a better approach to managing patients in primary non-arrhythmogenic cardiac arrest. Resuscitation 2008; 76:198-206.</ref>

A person who has hypotension and a bedside ultrasound showing [[hyperdynamic precordium|hyperdynamic]] left heart with a flat, collapsible IVC indicates low blood volume. If the person also has a fever, the clinician may determine [[sepsis]], or severe infection is causing the problem. If that same hypotensive person has back pain instead of a fever, the clinician may see an [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]] that is leaking or ruptured. Conversely, weak heart activity and a very full, non-collapsible IVC would indicate a cardiac cause for low blood pressure.

For those presenting with acute shortness of breath, ultrasound assessment of the lung, heart, and IVC can evaluate for potentially life threatening diseases including [[pneumothorax]], significant [[pleural effusion]]s, [[congestive heart failure]], [[pulmonary edema]], [[pericardial effusion]], and some large [[pulmonary embolus|pulmonary emboli]].<ref name="Labovitz focused cardiac" /><ref>Litchenstein DA, Meziere GA. Relevance of lung ultrasound in the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure. The BLUE Protocol. Chest 2008; 134(1):117-125.</ref>

With its increased availability, ultrasound is now frequently used more in [[Hospital emergency codes|code]] situations, in which a person have lost most or all signs of life.<ref>Blaivas M, Fox J. Outcome in cardiac arrest patients found to have cardiac standstill on bedside emergency department echocardiogram. Acad Emerg Med. 2001;8:616-621.</ref> Practitioners may use the ultrasound to see if the heart is moving, beating in organized fashion or if it has a [[pericardial effusion]] or fluid around it. [[Pericardiocentesis]], a procedure in which a needle is used to drain the effusion, can utilize ultrasound guidance of a needle to decrease the risk of hitting lungs, heart or other vital organs<ref>Salem K, Mulji A, Lonn E. Echocardiographically guided pericardiocentesis -- the gold standard for the management of pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade. Can J Cardiol 1999;15:1251-1255.</ref>

===Monitoring therapy===

Emergency ultrasound can not only diagnose, but also monitor a persons response to therapeutic interventions. Ultrasound can be utilized to assess a persons intravascular volume status and response to [[intravenous therapy|intravenous fluid]] therapy by measuring the size and respiratory change in the diameter of the IVC.<ref name="Labovitz focused cardiac"/> Ultrasound of the lungs may demonstrate resolution of [[pulmonary edema]] from [[congestive heart failure]].<ref>Noble VE et al. Ultrasound assessment for extravascular lung water in patients undergoing hemodialysis: time course for resolution. CHEST. 2009; 135(6) 1433-1439.</ref>

===Procedural guidance===

Using ultrasound to guide needles during procedures may improve success and decrease complications in procedures performed by multiple specialties, including [[central venous catheter|central]]<ref name="Moore"/> and [[intravenous therapy|venous access]],<ref>Constantino TG et al.

===Diagnostic===

Point-of-care ultrasound is being increasingly used to speed patient care and to avoid ionizing radiation. Quick diagnosis is still valuable for both an injured and healthcare professional. The efficiency of obtaining the answer to a focused question within minutes is one of the driving forces of the popularity of bedside ultrasound. Use of this modality in settings such as the emergency department can decrease waiting times and improve satisfaction among those served.<ref>Lindelius A, Torngren S, Nilsson L, Pettersson H, Adami J. Randomized clinical trial of bedside ultrasound among patients with abdominal pain in the emergency department: impact on patient satisfaction and health care consumption. Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med. 2009 Nov 27;17:60.</ref>

'''Cardiac:'''
Chest pain is one of the most common complaints presenting to the emergency department. Those presenting with chest pain, focused cardiac ultrasound can be helpful in the evaluation of persons with potentially life-threatening disease such as a [[pericardial effusion]], a severe [[pulmonary embolus]] (or blood clot in the lungs), or in screening those with suspected [[aortic dissection]].<ref name="Labovitz focused cardiac"/> The use of ultrasound is also helpful in persons with chest pain due to suspected [[coronary ischemia|heart ischemia]], especially when the baseline [[electrocardiography|electrocardiogram]] or EKG, is nondiagnostic.<ref name="Labovitz focused cardiac"/> The more technically demanding aspects of echocardiographic interpretation, and should be reserved for more formal comprehensive [[echocardiography]].<ref name="Labovitz focused cardiac"/>

'''Abdominal complaints:'''
Abdominal pain is also a common complaint in the primary care and emergency department setting. [[Gallbladder]] disease is a frequent cause of abdominal pain, but can also result in critical illness. Bedside ultrasound assesses the gallbladder for presence of [[gallstone]]s that cause the majority of gallbladder illness. Emergency ultrasound of the gallbladder can help speed diagnosis and care.<ref>Blaivas M, Harwood M, Lambert M. Decreasing length of stay with emergency ultrasound examination of the gallbladder. Ultrasonography 1999; 6:1020-1023</ref>

Flank pain can indicate obstructing [[kidney stone]]s or [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]].<ref>Kuhn M, Bonnin RLL, Davey MJ, et al. Emergency department ultrasound scanning for abdominal aortic aneurysm: Accessible, accurate, and advantageous. Ann Emerg Med. 2000; 36:219-223</ref> If obstructing kidney stones are suspected, the kidneys can be evaluated by ultrasound for signs of obstruction, called [[hydronephrosis]].<ref>Gaspari RJ, Horst K. Emergency ultrasound and urinalysis in the evaluation of flank pain. Acad Emerg Med. Dec 2005;12(12):1180-4</ref><ref>Kartal M, Eray O, Erdogru T, Yilmaz S. Prospective validation of a current algorithm including bedside US performed by emergency physicians for patients with acute flank pain suspected for renal colic. Emerg Med J. May 2006;23(5):341-4</ref>
A common use of ultrasound is identifying or evaluating the fetus in a person who is pregnant. Women in the first trimester of [[pregnancy]] can have a tubal or [[ectopic pregnancy]] outside the uterus that is life-threatening if not identified.<ref>Durham B, Lane B, Burbridge L, Balasubramaniam S. Pelvic Ultrasound Performed by Emergency Physicians for the Detection of Ectopic Pregnancy in Complicated First-Trimester Pregnancies. Ann Emerg Med. 1997; 29:338-347</ref> A more advanced fetus may be evaluated for normal heart rate and movement and gestational age to help guide care of both the fetus and the pregnant mother.

'''Other symptom-oriented diagnostic exams:'''
Blood clots that form in deep veins of the body can break off and block blood vessels in the lungs, resulting in low oxygen, heart strain and death. The most common location of these [[deep vein thrombosis|deep vein thromboses]] (DVTs) is in the legs. A bedside ultrasound can determine the presence or absence of blood clots and their location in the proximal lower extremity to behind the knee.<ref>Burnside PR, Brown MD, Kline JA. Systematic review of emergency physician-performed ultrasonography for lower extremity deep vein thrombosis. Acad Emerg Med. 2008;15:493-498</ref><ref>Theodoro DL, Blaivas M, Duggal D, et al. Emergency physician performed lower extremity doppler results in significant time savings. Acad Emerg Med. 2002; 9:541 Abstract.</ref>
Those presenting with eye pain or visual loss, ultrasound of the eye can be used for the detection of orbital pathology.<ref>Blaivas M. Bedside emergency department ultrasongraphy in evaluation of ocular pathology. Acad Emerg Med. 2000; 7:947-950</ref> Ultrasound has been described to detect [[retinal detachment]]s, [[vitreous hemorrhage]], dislocation of the lens, as well as evaluating [[optic nerve]] sheath diameters as a potential indicator of other diseases in the [[central nervous system]].<ref>Kimberly HH et al. Correlation of Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter with Direct Measurement of Intracranial Pressure. Acad Emerg Med. 2008: 15(2):201-204</ref><ref>Tayal V, Neulander M, Norton H, et al. Emergency department sonographic measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter to detect findings of increased intracranial pressure in adult head injury patients. Ann Emerg Med. 2007;49:508-514</ref>

Now that ultrasound is available in portable units that are smaller than laptop computers and handheld models, it is being used more and more in many clinical settings. Many practitioners use point-of-care ultrasound in diagnosing other urgent and emergent problems, including [[appendicitis]], [[testicular torsion]], and [[abscess]]es. To describe each of these fully is beyond the scope of this entry, and impossible as the use of ultrasound is expanding rapidly:

*'''Testicular Pain'''- Evaluation for [[testicular torsion]], [[orchitis]], [[epididymitis]], [[hernia]]
*Pelvic Pain- Evaluation for [[ovarian torsion]], [[ovarian cyst]], and ovarian cyst rupture
*'''IVC'''- Evaluation of volume status and estimation of fluid responsiveness
* '''The''' [http://emcrit.org/rush-exam/ '''RUSH exam'''] '''for Shock or Hypotension'''

==Training==

Emergency and point-of-care ultrasound is taught in a variety of settings. Many physicians are currently taught bedside ultrasound during the [[emergency medicine]] [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] training programs in the United States. It can also be learned as part of the continuing education process, through formal didactics, one-on-one training, and clinical application and practice. Other specialists may learn during their residency or fellowship training programs. There are specialized fellowship training programs for bedside ultrasound in emergency medicine, but these are not required nor expected for the use of this tool in practice.
