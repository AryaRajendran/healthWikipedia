The '''Cochrane Library''' (named after [[Archie Cochrane]]) is a collection of [[database]]s in [[medicine]] and other [[health care|healthcare]] specialties provided by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] and other organizations. At its core is the collection of '''Cochrane Reviews''', a database of [[systematic review]]s and [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] which summarize and interpret the results of medical research. The Cochrane Library aims to make the results of well-conducted [[clinical trial|controlled trials]] readily available and is a key resource in [[evidence-based medicine]].

==Access and use==
The Cochrane Library is a subscription-based database, originally published by Update Software and now part of the [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley Online]] system. In many countries, including parts of [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[India]], [[South Africa]], and [[Poland]], it has been made available free to all residents by "national provision". There are also arrangements for free access in much of [[Latin America]] and in "low-income countries", typically via [[HINARI]]. All countries have free access to two-page abstracts of all Cochrane Reviews and to short plain-language summaries of selected articles.

Cochrane Reviews appear to be relatively underused in the United States, presumably because public access is limited (the state of [[Wyoming]] is an exception, having arranged for free Cochrane materials access).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grimes DA, Hou MY, Lopez LM, Nanda K |title=Do clinical experts rely on the Cochrane library? |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=111 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=420–2 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18238981 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000300558.51373.ae |url=}}</ref>

==Contents==
The Cochrane Library consists of the following databases:
* The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Cochrane Reviews). Contains all the peer-reviewed systematic reviews and protocols prepared by the Cochrane Review Groups.
* The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). Contains quality-assessed abstracts of systematic reviews, including a summary of the review and a critical commentary of its overally quality.
* The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Is a database that contains details of articles of Controlled trials and other studies of healthcare interventions from bibliographic databases (majorly MEDLINE and EMBASE), and other published and unpublished sources that are difficult to access.<ref>Dickersin K, Manheimer E, Wieland S, Robinson KA, Lefebvre C, McDonald S. Development of the Cochrane Collaboration’s Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials. Eval Health Prof. 2002 Mar 1;25(1):38–64.</ref>
* The Cochrane Methodology Register (Methodology Register). Is a bibliography of publications that report on methods used in the conduct of controlled trials.
* Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA). Brings together details of completed and ongoing health technology assessments (studies of the medical, social, ethical and economic implications of healthcare interventions) from around the world.
* NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED). This database systematically identifies economic evaluations from around the world, appraises their quality, and highlights their relative strengths and weaknesses.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = The Cochrane Library | title = About The Cochrane Library | url = http://www.thecochranelibrary.com/view/0/AboutTheCochraneLibrary.html | accessdate = 2012-11-29 }}</ref>

The Cochrane Reviews, CENTRAL, Methodology Reviews and Methodology Register are produced by the Cochrane Collaboration. DARE, HTA and NHS EED are compiled and maintained by the [[Centre for Reviews and Dissemination]].

== Format ==
Cochrane Reviews take the format of full-length methodological studies. Cochrane researchers will perform searches of medical databases including [[MEDLINE]], [[PubMed]] and [[EMBASE]]; a continually updated database of trials called the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); hand searching, where researchers look through entire libraries of scientific journals by hand and; reference checking of obtained articles in order to identify studies that are relevant to the question they are attempting to answer. 

The quality of each study is carefully assessed using predefined criteria and evidence of weak methodology or the possibility that a study may have been affected by bias is reported in the review.

Cochrane Researchers then apply [[statistical analysis#Overview|statistical analysis]] to compare the data of the trials. This creates a review of studies, or [[systematic review]], which gives the final word on the efficacy of a particular medical intervention. The result often shows a lack of evidence for a particular treatment one way or the other, recommending additional medical studies before doctors and pharmacists prescribe a particular intervention.

Finished reviews are available as a full report with diagrams, in condensed form or as a plain language summary, in order to provide for every reader of the review.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Cochrane Library | title = Newcomer’s guide | url = http://www.cochrane.org/about-us/newcomers-guide#created | accessdate = 2010-11-29 }}</ref>

== Impact factor and ranking ==
In the most recent [[Journal Citation Reports]] publication, The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews has a 2010 [[impact factor]] of 6.186, ranking it 10th among 151 journals in the category "Medicine, General & Internal".

== Academic comments ==
The Cochrane Library Feedback tool allows users to provide comments on and feedback of Cochrane Reviews and Protocols in The Cochrane Library. If accepted, the feedback will be published in a scrolling list of comments in reverse chronological order, with the most recent submission at the top of the page.<ref>The Cochrane Collaboration.
