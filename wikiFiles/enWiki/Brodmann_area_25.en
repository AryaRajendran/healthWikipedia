'''''Brodmann area 25''''' (BA25) is an area in the [[cerebral cortex]] of the [[brain]] and delineated based on its [[cytoarchitecture|cytoarchitectonic]] characteristics.
It is also called the '''subgenual area''', '''''area subgenualis''''' or '''subgenual cingulate'''.
It is the 25th "[[Brodmann area]]" defined by [[Korbinian Brodmann]] (thus its name).
BA25 is located in the cingulate region as a narrow band in the caudal portion of the [[subcallosal area]] adjacent to the paraterminal gyrus.  The posterior parolfactory sulcus separates the paraterminal gyrus from BA25.  Rostrally it is bound by the prefrontal area 11 of Brodmann.<ref>[http://braininfo.rprc.washington.edu/Scripts/ancilcentraldirectory.aspx?ID=90 subgenual area 25.] braininfo.rprc.washington.edu, retrieved November 18, 2006.</ref>

==History==
Brodmann described this area as it is labeled now in 1909.  Originally in 1905, Brodmann labeled the area as part of area 24.  In 1909, he divided the area into area 24 and 25.<ref>[http://braininfo.rprc.washington.edu/Scripts/ancilcentraldirectory.aspx?ID=1043865377 area 25 of Brodmann-1909.] braininfo.rprc.washington.edu, retrieved November 19, 2006.</ref>

==Function==
This region is extremely rich in [[serotonin transporter]]s and is considered as a governor for a vast network involving areas like [[hypothalamus]] and [[brain stem]], which influences changes in appetite and sleep; the [[amygdala]] and [[Insular cortex|insula]], which affect the mood and anxiety; the [[hippocampus]], which plays an important role in memory formation; and some parts of the [[frontal cortex]] responsible for self-esteem.<ref name="sciam1">"[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=faulty-circuits Faulty Circuits]", ''Scientific American'', April 2010</ref>

==Involvement in depression==

The '''subcallosal cingulate gyrus''' which consists of BA25 as well as parts of [[Brodmann area 24|BA24]] and [[Brodmann area 32|BA32]] has been implicated as playing an important role in [[major depression]] and has been the target of [[deep brain stimulation]] to treat that disease.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The subcallosal cingulate gyrus in the context of major depression|author=Hamani C, Mayberg H, Stone S, Laxton A, Haber S, Lozano AM.

One study found that BA25 is metabolically overactive in [[treatment-resistant depression]].<ref>[http://www.neuron.org/content/article/fulltext?uid=PIIS089662730500156X&highlight=mayberg&highlight=deep%20brain%20stimulation Deep Brain Stimulation for Treatment-Resistant Depression] neuron.org, March 3, 2005.

In 2011 [[Helen S. Mayberg]] and collaborators described how they successfully treated a number of depressed people — individuals virtually catatonic with depression despite years of talk therapy, drugs, even shock therapy — with pacemaker-like electrodes ([[deep brain stimulation]]) in area 25. <ref>{{Cite journal

A decade earlier, Mayberg had identified area 25 as a key conduit of neural traffic between the "thinking" frontal cortex and the [[phylogenetically]] older central limbic region that gives rise to emotion. She subsequently found that area 25 appeared overactive in these depressed people — "like a gate left open," as she puts it — allowing negative emotions to overwhelm thinking and mood. Inserting the electrodes closed this gate and rapidly alleviated the depression of two-thirds of the trial's patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=[[Helen S.
