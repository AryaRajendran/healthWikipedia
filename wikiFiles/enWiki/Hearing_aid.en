A '''hearing aid''' is an electroacoustic device which typically fits in or behind the wearer's [[ear]], and is designed to amplify and [[Modulation|modulate]] sound for the wearer. Earlier devices, known as [[ear trumpet]]s or ear horns,<ref>Comparison of Hearing Aids Over the 20th Century. Ear & Hearing. 21(6):625-639, December 2000.

Similar devices include the [[Bone Anchored Hearing Aid|bone anchored hearing aid]], and [[cochlear implant]].

==Types==
There are many types of hearing aids (also known as hearing instruments), which vary in size, [[Electric power|power]] and [[circuitry]].
Among the different sizes and models are:

[[File:HearingAidTypes.jpg|right|thumb|NIH illustration of different hearing aid types.]]

===Body worn aids===
This was the first type of hearing aid invented by [[Harvey Fletcher]] while working at [[Bell Laboratories]].<ref>[http://books.google.ca/books?id=3N72rIoTHiEC&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=Harvey+Fletcher+hearing+aid+-wiki&source=bl&ots=GU5b6DG5zr&sig=b8MUoxOv68yQ9rqZ2nCwcewGg4o&hl=en&ei=yAI8S4TQG8GSlAfLnuiYBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=19&ved=0CE4Q6AEwEg#v=onepage&q=Harvey%20Fletcher%20hearing%20aid%20-wiki&f=false Signals, sound, and sensation By William M. Hartmann]</ref> Body aids consist of a case and an [[earmold]], attached by a wire. The case contains the electronic [[amplifier]] components, controls and [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] while the earmold typically contains a miniature [[loudspeaker]]. The case is typically about the size of a pack of [[playing cards]] and is carried in a pocket or on a belt.<ref name="NIH">{{citation
|title= Hearing Aid Basics
|url=http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/pages/hearingaid.aspx
|publisher = National Institute of Health
|accessdate =December 2, 2011}}</ref>
Without the size constraints of smaller hearing devices body worn aid designs can provide large amplification and long battery life at a lower cost. Body aids are still marketed in [[emerging markets]] because of their lower cost.<ref name="NIH" />

===Behind the ear aids (BTE)===
[[File:BTEhearingaids.png|thumb|A pair of BTE hearing aids]]
BTE aids consist of a case, an earmold or dome and a connection between them. The case contains the electronics, controls, battery, microphone(s) and often the loudspeaker. Generally, the case sits behind the [[Pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] with the connection from the case coming down the front into the ear. The sound from the instrument can be routed [[Acoustics|acoustically]] or electrically to the ear. If the sound is routed electrically, the speaker (receiver) is located in the earmold or an open-fit dome, while acoustically coupled instruments use a plastic tube to deliver the sound from the case’s loudspeaker to the earmold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/pages/hearingaid.aspx |title=Hearing Aids |publisher=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders |accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref>  

BTEs can be used for mild to profound hearing loss. As the electrical components are located outside the ear, the chance of moisture and earwax damaging the components is reduced, which can increase the durability of the instrument. BTEs are also easily connected to assistive listening devices, such as [[Frequency modulation|FM]] systems, to directly integrate sound sources with the instrument. BTE aids are commonly worn by children who need a durable type of hearing aid.<ref name="NIH" />

:'''"Mini" BTE (or "on-the-ear")''' aids: A new type of BTE aid called the mini BTE (or "on-the-ear") aid. It also fits behind/on the ear, but is smaller. A very thin, almost invisible tube is used to connect the aid to the ear canal. Mini BTEs may have a comfortable ear piece for insertion ("open fit"), but may also use a traditional earmold. Mini BTEs allow not only reduced occlusion or "plugged up" sensations in the ear canal, but also increase comfort, reduce feedback and address cosmetic concerns for many users.<ref>{{cite web

;Receiver in the Canal/Ear (CRT/RIC/RITE)

BTE hearing instruments that place the loudspeaker directly in the ear without a fitted earmold are often referred to as “Receiver in the Canal” instruments. These instruments use soft ear inserts, typically of [[silicone]], to position the loudspeaker in the patient’s ear.

Some of the advantages with this approach include improved sound quality, reduced case size, “open-fit” technology, and immediate patient fitting. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

;Earmolds
An earmold is created from an [[:wikt:impression|impression]] taken of the individual's outer ear. This usually ensures a comfortable fit and reduces the possibility of [[Audio feedback|feedback]].<ref name="NIH" /> Earmolds are made from a variety of hard (firm) and soft (pliable) materials. The color of the case and earmold of a BTE aid can be modified and optional decorations can be added. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===In the ear aids (ITE)===
These devices fit in the outer ear bowl (called the [[Pinna (anatomy)|concha]]); they are sometimes visible when standing face to face with someone. ITE hearing aids are custom made to fit each individual's ear. They can be used in mild to some severe hearing losses. [[Audio feedback|Feedback]], a squealing/whistling caused by sound (particularly high frequency sound) leaking and being amplified again, may be a problem for severe hearing losses.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Some modern circuits are able to provide feedback regulation or cancellation to assist with this.
Venting may also cause feedback. A vent is a tube primarily placed to offer pressure equalization. However, different vent styles and sizes can be used to influence and prevent feedback.<ref>[http://www5.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/Forschung/Publikationen/2007/Sickel07-SPS.pdf K. Sickel, Shortest Path Search with Constraints on Surface Models of In-ear Hearing Aids] ''

Traditionally, ITEs have not been recommended for young children because their fit could not be as easily modified as the earmold for a BTE, and thus the aid had to be replaced frequently as the child grew.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} However, there are new ITEs made from a [[silicone]] type material that mitigates the need for costly replacements.
ITE hearing aids can be connected wirelessly to FM systems, for instance with a body-worn FM receiver with induction neck-loop which transmits the audio signal from the FM transmitter inductively to the telecoil inside the hearing instrument.

ITC aids are smaller, filling only the bottom half of the external ear. The aid cannot be seen when face to face with the wearer. MIC and CIC aids are generally not visible unless the viewer looks directly into the wearer's ear.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/business/yourmoney/24novel.html?ex=1164517200&en=dba8306ee44bce99&ei=5070 The Hearing Aid as Fashion Statement], by Anne Eisenberg, September 24, 2005 on NYTimes.com.

Accessed 3 May 2007.</ref> These aids are intended for mild to moderately-severe losses. CICs are usually not recommended for people with good low frequency hearing, as the occlusion effect is much more noticeable.<ref>[http://www.hearingresearch.org/Dr.Ross/occlusion.htm The "Occlusion Effect" -- What it is, and What to Do About it], by Mark Ross, January, 2004 in Hearing Loss. Accessed 25 Nov 2007.</ref>

In-the-ear hearing aids are typically more expensive than behind-the-ear counterparts of equal functionality, because they are custom fitted to the patient's ear.
In fitting, an audiologist takes a physical impression ([[Polyvinyl_siloxane|mold]]) of the ear.
The mold is scanned by a specialized [[CAD]] system, resulting in a 3D model of the outer ear.
During modeling, the venting tube is inserted.
The digitally modeled ''shell'' is printed using a [[rapid prototyping]] technique such as [[stereolithography]].
Finally, the aid is assembled and shipped to the audiologist after a quality check.<ref>[http://www5.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/Forschung/Publikationen/2009/Sickel09-SMO.pdf K. Sickel et al., Semi-Automatic Manufacturing of Customized Hearing Aids Using a Feature Driven Rule-based Framework]

===Invisible in canal hearing aids (IIC)===
This style of hearing aids fits inside the ear canal completely, leaving little to no trace of an installed hearing aid visible. This is because it fits deeper in the canal than other types, so that it is out of view even when looking directly into the ear bowl (concha). A comfortable fit is achieved because the shell of the aid is custom-made to the individual ear canal after taking a mould.
Invisible hearing aid types use venting and their deep placement in the ear canal to give a more natural experience of hearing. Unlike other hearing aid types, with the IIC aid the majority of the ear is not blocked (occluded) by a large plastic shell. This means that sound can be collected more naturally by the shape of the ear, and can travel down into the ear canal as it would with unassisted hearing. Some models allow the wearer to use a mobile phone as a remote control to alter memory and volume settings, instead of taking the IIC out to do this. IIC types are most suitable for users up to middle age, but are not suitable for more elderly people.

===Extended wear hearing aids===
{{Main|Extended wear hearing aid}}
Extended wear hearing aids are hearing devices that are non-surgically placed in the ear canal by a hearing professional.  The extended wear hearing aid represents the first "invisible" hearing device. These devices are worn for 1–3 months at a time without removal.  They are made of soft material designed to contour to each user and can be used by people with mild to moderately severe hearing loss. Their close proximity to the ear drum results in improved sound directionality and localization, reduced feedback, and improved high frequency gain.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} While traditional BTE or ITC hearing aids require daily insertion and removal, extended wear hearing aids are worn continuously and then replaced with a new device.  Users can change volume and settings without the aid of a hearing professional. The devices are very useful for active individuals because their design protects against moisture and earwax and can be worn while exercising, showering, etc.  Because the device’s placement within the ear canal makes them invisible to observers, extended wear hearing aids are popular with those who are self-conscious about the aesthetics of BTE or ITC hearing aid models. As with other hearing devices, compatibility is based on an individual’s hearing loss, ear size and shape, medical conditions, and lifestyle.  The disadvantages include regular removal and reinsertion of the device when the battery dies, inability to go underwater, earplugs when showering, and for some discomfort with the fit since it is inserted deeply in the ear canal, the only part of the body where skin rests directly on top of bone.

===Open-fit devices===
"Open-fit" or "Over-the-Ear" (OTE) hearing aids are small behind-the-ear type devices. This type is characterized by a minimal amount of effect on the ear canal resonances, as it traditionally leaves the ear canal as open as possible, often only being plugged up by a small speaker resting in the middle of the ear canal space. Traditionally, these hearing aids have a small plastic case behind the ear and a small clear tube running into the ear canal. Inside the ear canal, a small soft silicone dome or a molded, highly [[vented]] [[acrylic glass|acrylic]] tip holds the tube in place.
This design is intended to reduce the [[Occlusion Effect|occlusion effect]]. Conversely, because of the increased possibility of feedback, and because an open fit allows low frequency sounds to leak out of the ear canal, they are limited to moderately severe high-frequency losses.
While the design approach is attractive to a general hearing aid user, open-fit devices can by their design have problems when connected to Assistive Listening Devices (ALD's). This problem has been addressed by manufacturers, who provide assistive listening devices that can be paired with the hearing aid.

===Personal, user, self, or consumer programmable===
The personal programmable, consumer programmable, consumer adjustable, or self programmable hearing aid allows the consumer to adjust their own hearing aid settings to their own preference using their own PC.  Personal programmable hearing aid manufacturers or dealers can also remotely adjust these types of hearing aids for the customer.  Available in all hearing aid styles, these hearing aids differ from traditional hearing aids only in that they are adjustable by the consumer.

===Disposable hearing aids===
Disposable hearing aids are hearing aids that have a non-replaceable battery. These aids are designed to use power sparingly, so that the battery lasts longer than batteries used in traditional hearing aids. Disposable hearing aids are meant to remove the task of battery replacement and other maintenance chores (adjustment or cleanings).  To date, two companies have brought disposable hearing aids to market: Songbird Hearing, and [[Lyric Hearing |Lyric]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  Songbird is a BTE hearing aid that is bought online and worn like any other BTE device.  When it runs out, the user replaces it with a new one.  Lyric is implanted deep in the ear canal by a professional.  When it runs out, it must be removed and replaced with a new one by a professional. Lyric devices are not individually sold but sold as an annual subscription with a fixed amount of devices available for use in the subscription.

===Bone anchored hearing aids (BAHA)===
{{Main|Bone anchored hearing aid}}
The [[Bone Anchored Hearing Aid|BAHA]] is an [[auditory system|auditory]] [[prosthetic]] based on bone conduction which can be [[surgically]] [[Implant (medicine)|implanted]]. It is an option for patients without external ear canals, when conventional hearing aids with a mould in the ear cannot be used. The BAHA uses the [[Human skull|skull]] as a pathway for sound to travel to the [[inner ear]].  For people with [[conductive hearing loss]], the BAHA bypasses the external [[auditory canal]] and middle ear, stimulating the functioning cochlea.  For people with [[unilateral hearing loss]], the BAHA uses the skull to conduct the sound from the deaf side to the side with the functioning cochlea.

Individuals under the age of two (five in the USA) typically wear the BAHA device on a Softband. This can be worn from the age of one month as babies tend to tolerate this arrangement very well. When the child's skull bone is sufficiently thick, a [[titanium]] "post" can be surgically embedded into the skull with a small [[abutment]] exposed outside the skin. The BAHA sound processor sits on this abutment and [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmits]] sound [[vibrations]] to the external abutment of the titanium implant.  The implant vibrates the skull and inner ear, which stimulate the [[nerve fiber]]s of the inner ear, allowing hearing.

The surgical procedure is simple both for the surgeon, involving very few risks for the experienced ear surgeon. For the patient, minimal discomfort and pain is reported. Patients may experience numbness of the area around the implant as small superficial nerves in the skin are sectioned during the procedure. This often disappears after some time. There is no risk of further hearing loss due to the surgery. One important feature of the Baha is that, if a patient for whatever reason does not want to continue with the arrangement, it takes the surgeon less than a minute to remove it. The Baha does not restrict the wearer from any activities such as outdoor life, sporting activities etc.

A BAHA can be connected to an FM system by attaching a miniaturized FM receiver to it.

Two main brands manufacture BAHAs today - the original inventors [[Cochlear Baha|Cochlear]], and the hearing aid company [[Oticon]].

===Eyeglass aids===
During the late 1950s through 1970s, before in-the-ear aids became common (and in an era when thick-rimmed [[eyeglasses]] were popular), people who wore both glasses and hearing aids frequently chose a type of hearing aid that was built into the
[[Temple (anatomy)|temple]] pieces of the spectacles.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  However, the combination of glasses and hearing aids was inflexible: the range of frame styles was limited, and the user had to wear both hearing aids and glasses at once or wear neither.  Today, people who use both glasses and hearing aids can use in-the-ear types, or rest a BTE neatly alongside the arm of the glasses. There are still some specialized situations where hearing aids built into the frame of eyeglasses can be useful, such as when a person has hearing loss mainly in one ear: sound from a microphone on the "bad" side can be sent through the frame to the side with better hearing.

This can also be achieved by using CROS or bi-CROS style hearing aids, which are now [[wireless]] in sending sound to the better side.

;Spectacle hearing aids 
Theseare generally worn by people with a hearing loss who either prefer a more cosmetic appeal of their hearing aids by being attached to their glasses or where sound cannot be passed in the normal way, via a hearing aids, perhaps due to a blockage in the ear canal. pathway or if the client suffers from continual infections in the ear.
Spectacle aids come in two forms, ''bone conduction spectacles'' and ''air conduction spectacles''.

;Bone Conduction Spectacles 
Sounds are transmitted via a receiver attached from the arm of the spectacles which are fitted firmly behind the boney portion of the skull at the back of the ear, (mastoid process) by means of pressure, applied on the arm of the spectacles. The sound is passed from the receiver on the arm of the spectacles to the inner ear (cochlea), via the bony portion. The process of transmitting the sound through the bone requires a great amount of power. Bone conduction aids generally have a poorer high pitch response and are therefore best used for ''conductive hearing losses'' or where it is impractical to fit standard hearing aids.

;Air Conduction Spectacles
Unlike the bone conduction spectacles the sound is transmitted via hearing aids which are attached to the arm or arms of the spectacles. When removing your glasses for cleaning, the hearing aids are detached at the same time. Whilst there are genuine instances where spectacle aids are a preferred choice, they may not always be the most practical option. 

Recently, a new type of eyeglass aid was introduced. These 'hearing glasses' feature directional [[Sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]]: four microphones on each side of the frame effectively work as two directional microphones, which are able to discern between sound coming from the front and sound coming from the sides or back of the user.<ref>[http://www.aarpinternational.org/agingadvances_sub/agingadvances_sub_show.htm?doc_id=553940 Netherlands: Dutch Unveil 'Varibel' - The Eyeglasses That Hear], Publish Date: March 01, 2007, Related Company Website: www, varibel.nl. Accessed 10
Feb 2008.</ref> This improves the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] by allowing for amplification of the sound coming from the front, the direction in which the user is looking, and [[active noise control]] for sounds coming from the sides or behind.
Only very recently has the technology required become small enough to be fitted in the frame of the glasses. As a recent addition to the market, this new hearing aid is currently available only in the Netherlands and Belgium.<ref>The manufacturer's website is published in Dutch and French at http://varibel.nl/site/home/default.asp and there is a TV news report in English at http://varibel.nl/site/Files/default.asp?iChannel=4&nChannel=Files</ref>

==Technology==
{{see also|History of hearing aids}}
===Compatibility with telephones===
[[File:Hearing induction loop hearing aid.jpg|thumb|A sign in a train station explains that the public announcement system uses a "Hearing Induction Loop" ([[Audio induction loop]]). Hearing aid users can use a telecoil (T) switch to hear announcements directly through their hearing aid receiver.]]
A hearing aid and a telephone are "compatible" when they can connect to each other in a way that produces clear, easily-understood sound. The term "compatibility" is applied to all three types of telephones (wired, cordless, and mobile). There are two ways telephones and hearing aids can connect with each other:

* '''Acoustically:''' the ''sound'' from the phone's speaker is picked up by the hearing aid's microphone.
* '''Electromagnetically:''' the ''signal'' inside the phone's speaker is picked up by the hearing aid's "telecoil" or "T-coil", a special loop of wire inside the hearing aid.

Note that telecoil coupling has nothing to do with the radio signal in a cellular or cordless phone: the audio signal picked up by the telecoil is the weak electromagnetic field that is generated by the [[voice coil]] in the phone's speaker as it pushes the speaker cone back and forth. 

The electromagnetic (telecoil) mode is usually more effective than the acoustic method. This is mainly because the microphone is automatically switched off when the hearing aid is operating in telecoil mode, so background noise is not amplified. Since there is an electronic connection to the phone, the sound is clearer and distortion is less likely. But in order for this to work, the phone has to be hearing-aid compatible. More technically, the phone's speaker has to have a voice coil that generates a relatively strong electromagnetic field. Speakers with strong voice coils are more expensive and require more energy than the tiny ones used in many modern telephones; phones with the small low-power speakers cannot couple electromagnetically with the telecoil in the hearing aid, so the hearing aid must then switch to acoustic mode.  Also, many mobile phones emit high levels of electromagnetic noise that creates audible static in the hearing aid when the telecoil is used.  A workaround that resolves this issue on many mobile phones is to plug a wired (not Bluetooth) headset into the mobile phone; with the headset placed near the hearing aid the phone can be held far enough away to attenuate the static.

On March 21, 2007, the [[Telecommunications Industry Association]] issued the [http://global.ihs.com/doc_detail.cfm?currency_code=USD&customer_id=2125422C4E0A&oshid=2125422C4D0A&shopping_cart_id=292558332C4A2020495A4D3B200A&country_code=US&lang_code=ENGL&item_s_key=00492018&item_key_date=890114&input_doc_number=TIA-1083&input_doc_title= TIA-1083] standard, which gives manufacturers of cordless telephones the ability to test their products for compatibility with most hearing aids that have a T-Coil magnetic coupling mode. With this testing, digital cordless phone manufacturers will be able to inform consumers about which products will work with their hearing aids.<ref>http://www.tiaonline.org/news_events/press_room/press_releases/2007/press-1175779463784.cfm</ref>

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has a ratings scale for compatibility between hearing aids and phones:

* When operating in acoustic ('''M'''icrophone) mode, the ratings are from M1 (worst) to M4 (best).
* When operating in electromagnetic ('''T'''elecoil) mode, the ratings are from T1 (worst) to T4 (best).

The best possible rating is M4/T4 meaning that the phone works well in both modes. Devices rated below M3 are unsatisfactory for people with hearing aids.

===Wireless hearing aids===
Recent hearing aids include wireless hearing aids. One hearing aid can transmit to the other side so that pressing one aid's program button simultaneously changes the other aid, so that both aids change background settings simultaneously. FM listening systems are now emerging with wireless receivers integrated with the use of hearing aids. A separate wireless microphone can be given to a partner to wear in a restaurant, in the car, during leisure time, in the shopping mall, at lectures, or during religious services. The voice is transmitted wirelessly to the hearing aids eliminating the effects of distance and [[background noise]]. FM systems have shown to give the best speech understanding in noise of all available technologies.
FM systems can also be hooked up to a TV or a stereo.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

2.4 gigahertz Bluetooth connectivity is the most recent innovation in wireless interfacing for hearing instruments to audio sources such as TV streamers or Bluetooth enabled mobile phones. Current hearing aids generally do not stream directly via Bluetooth but rather do so through a secondary streaming device (usually worn around the neck or in a pocket), this bluetooth enabled secondary device then streams wirelessly to the hearing aid but can only do so over a short distance. This technology can be applied to ready-to-wear devices (BTE, Mini BTE, RIE, etc.) or to custom made devices that fit directly into the ear.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In developed countries FM systems are considered a cornerstone in the treatment of hearing loss in children. More and more adults discover the benefits of wireless FM systems as well, especially since transmitters with different microphone settings and [[Bluetooth]] for wireless cell phone communication have become available.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Dave Fabry, Hans Mülder, Evert Dijkstra|year= 2007|month= November|title= Acceptance of the wireless microphone as a hearing aid accessory for adults|journal= The Hearing Journal|volume= 60 (11)|pages= 32–36}}</ref>

Many [[theatres]] and [[lecture halls]] are now equipped with [[Assistive Listening Device|assistive listening system]]s that transmit the sound directly from the stage; [[audience]] members can borrow suitable receivers and hear the program without background noise. In some theatres and churches FM transmitters are available that work with the personal FM receivers of hearing instruments.<ref>http://www.phonakfm.nl/</ref>

===Directional microphones===
Most older hearing aids have only an omnidirectional microphone. An omnidirectional microphone amplifies sounds equally from all directions. In contrast, a directional microphone amplifies sounds from in front more than sounds from other directions. This means that sounds originating from the direction the listener is facing are amplified more than sounds coming from behind or other directions. If the speech is in front of the listener and the noise is from a different direction, then compared to an omnidirectional microphone, a directional microphone provides a better [[signal to noise ratio]]. Improving the signal to noise ratio improves speech understanding in noise.  Directional microphones are the second best method to improve the signal to noise ratio (the best method is an FM system).<ref>Hawkins, D. (1984). Comparisons of speech recognition in noise by mildly-to-moderately hearing-impaired
children using hearing aids and FM systems. Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders, 49(4), 409.</ref>

Many hearing aids now have both an omnidirectional and a directional microphone. This is because speech often comes from directions other than in front of the listener. Usually, the omnidirectional microphone mode is used in quiet listening situations (e.g. living room) whereas the directional microphone is used in noisy listening situations (e.g. restaurant). The microphone mode is typically selected by using a switch. Some hearing aids automatically switch the microphone mode.

[[Adaptive]] directional microphones vary the direction of maximum amplification. The direction of amplification is varied by the hearing aid processor. The processor attempts to provide maximum amplification in the direction of the speech signal. Unless the user manually temporarily switches to a "restaurant program, forward only mode" adaptive directional microphones have a disadvantage of amplifying speech of other talkers in a restaurant. This makes it difficult for the processor to select the desired speech signal. Another disadvantage is that noise often mimics speech characteristics, making it difficult to separate the speech from the noise. Despite the disadvantages, adaptive directional microphones can provide improved speech recognition in noise<ref>Ricketts, T. & Henry, P. (2002). Evaluation of an adaptive, directional-microphone hearing aid. International Journal of Audiology, 41(2), 100–112.</ref>

Directional microphones only provide benefit when the distance to the talker is small. In contrast, an FM system continues to provide a better signal to noise ratio even at larger speaker to talker distances.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Lewis M Samantha, Crandell Carl C, Valente Michael, Horn Jane Enrietto |year= 2004|title= Speech perception in noise: directional microphones versus frequency modulation (FM) systems|journal= Journal of the American Academy of Audiology |volume= 15(6)|pages= 426–439}}</ref>

===Telecoil===
Telecoils or T-coils (from "Telephone Coils"), are a small device installed in a hearing aid or cochlear implant. [[Audio induction loop]]s generate an electromagnetic field that can be detected by T-coils, allowing audio sources to be directly connected to a hearing aid. The T-coil is intended to help the wearer filter out background noise. They can be used with telephones, FM systems (with neck loops), and induction loop systems (also called "hearing loops") that transmit sound to hearing aids from public address systems and TVs. In the UK and the Nordic countries, hearing loops are widely used in churches, shops, railway stations, and other public places. In the U.S.A., telecoils and hearing loops are gradually becoming more common. Audio induction [http://zemljevid.najdi.si/maps/location/nmap.jsp?id=ada33247db5e7acafdc65978fae46809fc5835eaaa72eaa4c08f50c691f50518f9aa6393af906b5968e1d4e46cbda42a77701addf4ce1a0b731d518e4622385d loops], telecoils and hearing loops are gradually becoming more common also in [[Slovenia]].

A T-coil consists of a metal core (or rod) around which ultra-fine wire is coiled. T-coils are also called induction coils because when the coil is placed in a magnetic field, an alternating electrical current is induced in the wire (Ross, 2002b; Ross, 2004). The T-coil detects magnetic energy and transduces (converts) it to electrical energy.  In the United States, the [[Telecommunications Industry Association]]'s TIA-1083 standard, specifies how analog handsets can interact with telecoil devices, to ensure the optimal performance.<ref>http://ftp.tiaonline.org/UPED/20070717/UPED-20070717-010_TIA-1083_Flyer.pdf</ref>

Although T-coils are effectively a wide-band receiver, interference is unusual in most hearing loop situations. Interference can manifest as a buzzing sound, which varies in volume depending on the distance the wearer is from the source. Sources are electromagnetic fields, such as CRT computer monitors, older fluorescent lighting, some dimmer switches, many household electrical appliances and airplanes.

The states of Florida and Arizona have passed legislation that requires hearing professionals to inform patients about the usefulness of telecoils.

In the United States, the [http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/hac.html Hearing Aid Compatibility Act of 1988] (HAC Act) requires that the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) ensure that all telephones manufactured or imported for use in the United States after August 1989, and all “essential” telephones, be hearing aid-compatible (through the use of a telecoil).

"Essential" phones are defined as "coin-operated telephones, telephones provided for emergency use, and other telephones frequently needed for use by persons using such hearing aids." These might include workplace telephones, telephones in confined settings (like hospitals and nursing homes), and telephones in hotel and motel rooms. Secure telephones, as well as telephones used with public mobile and private radio services, are exempt from the HAC Act. "Secure" phones are defined as "telephones that are approved by the U.S. Government for the transmission of classified or sensitive voice communications."

In 2003, the FCC adopted rules to make [[digital]] [[wireless telephone]]s compatible with hearing aids and [[cochlear implant]]s. Although analog wireless phones do not usually cause interference with hearing aids or cochlear implants, digital wireless phones often do because of electromagnetic energy emitted by the phone's [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]], [[backlight]], or other components. The FCC has set a timetable for the development and sale of digital wireless telephones that are compatible with hearing aids. This effort promises to increase the number of digital wireless telephones that are hearing aid-compatible.

===Direct audio input===
[[File:Direct Audio Input connector.jpg|thumb|alt=A direct audio input connector.|A DAI plug on the end of a cable.]]
Direct audio input (DAI) allows the hearing aid to be directly connected to an external audio source like a CD player or an assistive listening device (ALD). By its very nature, DAI is susceptible to far less electromagnetic interference, and yields a better quality audio signal as opposed to using a T-coil with standard [[headphones]].

===Processing===
Every electronic hearing aid has at minimum a microphone, a loudspeaker (commonly called a receiver), a battery, and electronic circuitry.  The electronic circuitry varies among devices, even if they are the same style. The circuitry falls into three categories based on the type of audio processing (analog or digital) and the type of control circuitry (adjustable or programmable).

* [[Analogue electronics|Analog]] audio
** Adjustable control: The audio circuit is analog with electronic components that can be adjusted. The hearing professional determines the gain and other specifications required for the wearer, and then adjusts the analog components either with small controls on the hearing aid itself or by having a laboratory build the hearing aid to meet those specifications. After the adjustment the resulting the audio does not change any further, other than overall loudness that the wearer adjusts with a volume control. This type of circuitry is generally the least flexible. The first practical electronic hearing aid with adjustable analog audio circuitry was based on US Patent 2,017,358, "Hearing Aid Apparatus and Amplifier" by Samual Gordon Taylor, filed in 1932.
** Programmable control: The audio circuit is analog but with additional electronic control circuitry that can be programmed by an audiologist, oftentimes with more than one program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/252221-analog-vs-digital-hearing-aids/|title=Analog Vs. Digital Hearing Aids|last=Heidtman|first=Laurel|date=28 September 2010|publisher=LiveStrong.com|accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> The electronic control circuitry can be fixed during manufacturing or in some cases, the hearing professional can use an external computer temporarily connected to the hearing aid to program the additional control circuitry. The wearer can change the program for different listening environments by pressing buttons either on the device itself or on a remote control or in some cases the additional control circuitry operates automatically. This type of circuitry is generally more flexible than simple adjustable controls. The first hearing aid with analog audio circuitry and automatic digital electronic control circuitry was based on US Patent 4,025,721, "Method of and means for adaptively filtering near-stationary noise from speech" by D Graupe, GD Causey, filed in 1975. This digital electronic control circuitry was used to identify and automatically reduce noise in individual frequency channels of the analog audio circuits and was known as the Zeta Noise Blocker.
* [[Digital]] audio, programmable control: Both the audio circuit and the additional control circuits are fully digital. The hearing professional programs the hearing aid with an external computer temporarily connected to the device and can adjust all processing characteristics on an individual basis.  Fully digital circuitry allows implementation of many additional features not possible with analog circuitry, can be used in all styles of hearing aids and is the most flexible; for example, digital hearing aids can be programmed to amplify certain frequencies more than others, and can provide better sound quality than analog hearing aids.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myhearpod.com/digital-hearing-aids/|title=Digital Hearing Aids: What You Should Know Before You Buy|publisher=HearPod|accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> Fully digital hearing aids can be programmed with multiple programs that can be invoked by the wearer, or that operate automatically and adaptively. These programs reduce acoustic feedback (whistling), reduce background noise, detect and automatically accommodate different listening environments (loud vs soft, speech vs music, quiet vs noisy, etc.), control additional components such as multiple microphones to improve spatial hearing, transpose frequencies (shift high frequencies that a wearer may not hear to lower frequency regions where hearing may be better), and implement many other features. Fully digital circuitry also allows control over wireless transmission capability for both the audio and the control circuitry. Control signals in a hearing aid on one ear can be sent wirelessly to the control circuitry in the hearing aid on the opposite ear to ensure that the audio in both ears is either matched directly or that the audio contains intentional differences that mimic the differences in normal binaural hearing to preserve spatial hearing ability. Audio signals can be sent wirelessly to and from external devices through a separate module, often a small device worn like a pendant and commonly called a “streamer”, that allows wireless connection to yet other external devices. This capability allows optimal use of mobile telephones, personal music players, remote microphones and other devices. With the addition of speech recognition and internet capability in the mobile phone, the wearer has optimal communication ability in many more situations than with hearing aids alone. This growing list includes voice activated dialing, voice activated software applications either on the phone or on the internet, receipt of audio signals from databases on the phone or on internet, or audio signals from television sets or from global positioning systems.  The first practical, wearable, fully digital hearing aid was invented by Maynard Engebretson, Robert E Morley, Jr. and Gerald R Popelka.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/Publications/leader/2007/071226/f071226c.htm|title=Digital Hearing Aids|last=Levitt|first=Harry|date=26 December 2007|publisher=The Asha Leader|accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> Their work resulted in [[United States patent law|US Patent]] 4,548,082, "Hearing aids, signal supplying apparatus, systems for compensating hearing deficiencies, and methods" by A Maynard Engebretson, Robert E Morley, Jr. and Gerald R Popelka, filed in 1984. This patent formed the basis of all subsequent fully digital hearing aids from all manufacturers, including those produced currently.

==Indications==
Hearing aids are incapable of truly correcting a hearing loss; they are an ''aid'' to make sounds more accessible. Two primary issues minimize the effectiveness of hearing aids:
* When the [[primary auditory cortex]] does not receive regular stimulation, this part of the [[brain]] loses [[cell (biology)|cell]]s which process sound. Cell loss increases as the degree of hearing loss increases.
* Damage to the [[hair cells]] of the inner ear results in [[sensorineural hearing loss]], which affects the ability to [[discriminate]] between sounds. This often manifests as a decreased ability to understand speech, and simply amplifying speech (as a hearing aid does) is often insufficient to improve speech perception.

==Adjustment==
Hearing aids are incapable of truly correcting a hearing loss; they are an aid to make sounds more accessible. Three primary issues minimize the effectiveness of hearing aids:
* The [[occlusion effect]] is a common complaint, especially for new users. Though if the aids are worn regularly, most people will become acclimated after a few weeks. If the effect persists, an [[Audiology|audiologist]] or Hearing Instrument Specialist can sometimes further tune the hearing aid(s).
* The [[compression effect]]: The amplification needed to make quiet sounds audible, if applied to loud sounds would damage the inner ear (cochlea). Louder sounds are therefore reduced giving a smaller audible volume range and hence inherent distortion.
* The initial fitting appointment is rarely sufficient, and multiple follow-up visits are often necessary.  Most audiologists or Hearing Instrument Specialists will recommend an up-to-date [[audiogram]] at the time of purchase and at subsequent fittings.

==Evaluation==
There are several ways of evaluating how well a hearing aid compensates for hearing loss.  One approach is [[audiometry]] which measures a subject's hearing levels in laboratory conditions.  The threshold of audibility for various sounds and intensities is measured in a variety of conditions.  Although audiometric tests may attempt to mimic real-world conditions, the patient's own every day experiences may differ.  An alternative approach is self-report assessment, where the patient reports their experience with the hearing aid.<ref>{{cite pmid|10981593}}</ref><ref>http://www.audiologyonline.com/articles/self-report-assessment-hearing-aid-931</ref>

==Regulation==
===Ireland===
Like much of the Irish health care system, hearing aid provision is a mixture of public and private.

Hearing aids are provided by the State to children, OAPs and to people whose income is at or below that of the State Pension. The Irish State hearing aid provision is extremely poor; people often have to wait for two years for an appointment.

It is estimated that the total cost to the State, of supplying one hearing aid, exceeds €2,000.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Hearing aids are also available privately, and there is grant assistance available for insured workers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Schemes/DentalOpticalAndHearingBenefits/Pages/Aural.aspx|title=Aural|publisher=Ireland Department of Social Protection|accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref>

Irish taxpayers can also claim tax relief, at the standard rate, as hearing aids are recognised as a medical device.

Hearing aids in the Republic of Ireland are exempt from VAT.

Hearing aid providers in Ireland, mostly belong to the [[Irish Society of Hearing Aid Audiologists]].

===United States===

Ordinary hearing aids are Class I regulated medical devices under Federal [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) rules.<ref>21 U.S.C. § 360k (a) (2005)</ref>  A 1976 statute explicitly prohibits any state requirement that is "different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable" to regulated medical devices (which includes hearing aids) which relates "to the safety and effectiveness of the device."<ref>21 U.S.C. 5 360k (a) (2005)</ref>  Inconsistent state regulation is preempted under the federal law.<ref>See, e.g. Missouri Board of Examiners for Hearing Instrument Specialists v. Hearing Help Express, Inc., 447 3d 1033 (8th Cir. 2006)</ref>  In the late 1970s, the FDA established federal rules governing hearing aid sales,<ref>Final Rule issued in Docket 76N-0019, 42 Fed. Reg. 9286 (Feb. 15, 1977).</ref> and addressed various requests by state authorities for exemptions from federal preemption, granting some and denying others.<ref>

Reg. 67326; Medical Devices:  Applications for Exemption from Federal Preemption of State and Local hearing Aid Requirements, Docket No. 78P-0222, 45 Fed. 67325 (Oct. 10, 1980).</ref>

==Purchase costs==
[[File:Bonavoxshop.JPG|thumb|Hearing aid shop, [[Dublin, Ireland]].]]

Several industrialized countries supply free or heavily-discounted hearing aids through their [[Publicly funded health care|publicly funded health care system]].

===Australia===
The [[Australia]]n [[Department of Health and Ageing]] provides eligible Australian citizens and residents with a basic hearing aid free-of-charge, though recipients can pay a "top up" charge if they wish to upgrade to a hearing aid with more or better features.  Maintenance of these hearing aids and a regular supply of batteries is also provided, on payment of a small annual maintenance fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www6.health.gov.au/internet/wcms/publishing.nsf/Content/health-hear-understanding|title=Understanding the Australian Government Hearing Services Program|accessdate=2007-12-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070909102734/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/wcms/publishing.nsf/Content/health-hear-understanding <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-09}}</ref>

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], health care is a responsibility of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]].  In the province of [[Ontario]], the price of hearing aids is partially reimbursed through the Assistive Devices Program of the [[Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (Ontario)|Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care]], up to $500 for each hearing aid, every three years. Like eye appointments, audiological appointments are no longer covered through the provincial public health plan. Audiometric testing can still easily be obtained, often free of charge, in private sector hearing aid clinics and some ear, nose and throat doctors offices. Hearing aids may be covered to some extent by private insurance or in some cases through government programs such as [[Veterans Affairs Canada|Department of Veteran Affairs]] or [[Workplace Safety & Insurance Board]].

===Iceland===
Social Insurance pays a one time fee of ISK 30,000 for any kind of hearing aid. However, the rules are complicated and require that both ears have a significant hearing loss in order to qualify for reimbursement.  BTE hearing aids range from ISK 60,000 to ISK 300,000.<ref>[http://www.tr.is/english Social Insurance Administration - Iceland] Accessed 30 November 2007</ref>

===India===
In India hearing aids of all kinds are easily available. Under Central and state government health services, the poor can often avail themselves of free hearing devices. However, market prices vary for others and can range from Rs 1,000 to Rs 215,000.

===UK===
Within the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the [[National Health Service|NHS]] provides BTE hearing aids to NHS patients, on long-term loan, free of charge.  BTEs are often the only style available, and private purchases may be necessary if a user desires a different style. Batteries are free. Private hearing aid purchases can cost from £600 to £3,500.<ref>[http://www.rnid.org.uk/VirtualContent/101701/NHS_hearing_aid_service_September_2009.pdf NHS hearing aid service fact sheet] Accessed 26 November 2007</ref>

===US===
Most private US health care providers do not provide coverage for hearing aids, so all costs are usually borne by the recipient. The cost for a single hearing aid can vary between $500 to $6,000 or more, depending on the level of technology and whether the clinician bundles fitting fees into the cost of the hearing aid. Though if an adult has a [[hearing loss]] which substantially limits major life activities, some state-run [[Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973|vocational rehabilitation]] programs can provide upwards of full financial assistance. Severe and profound hearing loss often falls within the "substantially limiting" category.<ref>[http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/deafness.html The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission: Questions and Answers about Deafness and Hearing Impairments in the Workplace and the Americans with Disabilities Act] Accessed 26 November 2007</ref> Less expensive hearing aids can be found on the internet or mail order catalogs, but some in the $200 range tend to amplify the low frequencies of background noise, making it harder to hear the human voice.<ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-03-09/health/sc-health-0309-hearing-aid-20110309_1_hearing-aid-hearing-loss-hearing-loss-association Now Hear This] ''Chicago Tribune'' March 9, 2011</ref>
 
The cost of hearing aids is a [[Itemized deduction#Examples of allowable itemized deductions|tax-deductible]] medical expense for those who [[Itemized deduction|itemize]] medical deductions.<ref>[http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc502.html Topic 502 - Medical and Dental Expenses] Accessed 26 November 2007</ref>

==Batteries==
While there are some rare instances that a hearing aid uses a rechargeable battery or a long-life disposable battery, the majority of modern hearing aids use one of five standard [[Watch battery|Button Cell]] [[Zinc-air battery|Zinc-air batteries]]. (Older hearing aids often used [[mercury battery]] cells, but these cells have become banned in most countries today.)  Modern hearing aid button cell types are typically referred to by their common number name or the color of their packaging.

They are typically loaded into the hearing aid via a rotating battery door, with the flat side (case) as the positive terminal ([[cathode]]) and the rounded side as the negative terminal ([[anode]]).

These batteries all operate from 1.35 to 1.45[[Volts]].

The type of battery a specific hearing aid utilizes depends on the physical size allowable and the desired lifetime of the battery, which is in turn determined by the [[Electric power|power]] draw of the hearing aid device. Typical battery lifetimes run between 1 and 14 days (assuming 16 hour days).
