'''Scalding''' (from the Latin word ''calidus'', meaning hot<ref>Mosby’s Medical, Nursing and Allied Health Dictionary, Fourth Edition, Mosby-Year Book Inc., 1994, p. 1395</ref>) is a form of [[burn]]ing from heated [[fluids]] such as boiling water or steam. Most scalds result from exposure to high-temperature water such as tap water in baths and showers or cooking water boiled for the preparation of foods. Another common cause of scalds is spilled hot drinks, such as [[coffee]]. Scalds are generally more common in children, especially from the accidental spilling of hot liquids. Most scalds are considered first or second degree burns, but third degree burns can result, especially with prolonged contact. Scalds are typically far more severe when caused by steam, because it has absorbed a great amount of [[latent heat]], and is therefore far more effective at heating objects.

== Treatment ==
Applying [[first aid]] for scalds is the same as for burns. First, the site of the injury should be removed from the source of heat, to prevent further scalding. If the burn is at least second degree, remove any jewelry or clothing from the site, unless it is already stuck to the skin.  Cool the scald for about 20 minutes with cool or lukewarm water, such as tap water from a faucet.<ref name="Burns and scalds">[http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Burns-and-scalds/Pages/Introduction.aspx Burns and scalds - NHS Choices], Treating Burns and Scalds.</ref> Ice should be avoided, as it can do further damage to area around the injury,<ref name="The Dos and Don'ts of Burns">[http://health.ninemsn.com/pregnancy/parenthood/694148/the-dos-and-donts-of-burns The Dos and Don'ts of Burns], What's the best way to treat a burn?</ref> as should butter, toothpaste, and specialized creams. With [[second-degree burn]]s, [[blister]]s will form, but should never be popped, as it only increases chances of infection. With [[third-degree burn]]s, it is best to wrap the injury very loosely to keep it clean, and seek expert medical attention.

== Use in food production ==
The carcasses of [[poultry]] and [[pig slaughter|pig]]s are commonly scalded after slaughter to facilitate the removal of feathers and hair.  Methods including immersion in tanks of hot water or spraying with steam.  The scalding may either be hard or soft in which the temperature or duration is varied.  A hard scald of 58°C for 2.5 minutes will remove the [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] of poultry and this is commonly used for carcasses that will be frozen so that their appearance is white and attractive.<ref>{{citation |title=Microbial ecology of food commodities |chapter=Scalding |page=113 |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-306-48675-3}}</ref>
