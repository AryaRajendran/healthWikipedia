'''International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification''' (ICD-10-CM) provided by the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) and the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] (NCHS), for [[medical coding]] and reporting in the United States. The ICD-10-CM is a [[morbidity]] classification for classifying [[diagnoses]] and reason for visits in all American health care settings. The ICD-10-CM is based on the [[ICD-10]], the statistical classification of disease published by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) which replaces [[ICD-9]]. <ref Name="CMS">{{cite web

==Conventions==
General rules for use of the guidelines. They are incorporated within the ICD-10-CM as instructional notes.<ref>[http://www.cms.gov/ICD10/Downloads/7_Guidelines10cm2010.pdf ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting 2010]</ref>

===Level of Detail in Coding===
ICD-10-CM Diagnosis codes are to be used and reported at their highest number of [[Numerical digit|digits]] available.
They are composed of codes with 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 digits. Three digits are used as the heading of a category of codes that may be further subdivided by the use of fourth and/or fifth digits (preceded by a decimal, i.e. A00.1 Cholera due to Vibrio cholerae 01, biovar eltor), which provides greater detail.  A code is invalid if it has not been coded to the full number of characters required for that code, including the 7th character, if applicable.

===Seventh character and placeholders===
Some codes require the use of a seventh character for codes in chapters [[ICD-10_Clinical_Modification#7th_Character|M, O, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y]].  If there are fewer than six characters in the code the placeholder "x" is used to ensure that the seventh character is always in the seventh position.  Example S03.4xxA Sprain of jaw, initial encounter.

===Excludes Notes===
ICD-10-CM has two types of excludes notes.
* Exclude 1 - Indicates that the code excluded should never be used at the same time as the code in this section
* Exclude 2 - Indicates that the condition excluded is not part of the condition represented by the code, but a patient may have both conditions at the same time
