'''Laron syndrome''', or '''Laron-type dwarfism''', is an [[autosomal]] [[recessive]] disorder characterized by an insensitivity to [[growth hormone]] (GH), caused by a variant of the [[growth hormone receptor]]. It causes [[short stature]] and a resistance to [[diabetes]] and cancer.

==Eponym==
It is named after [[Zvi Laron]], the [[Israelis|Israeli]] researcher who, with A. Pertzelan and S. Mannheimer, first reported the condition in 1966,<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2825}}</ref><ref name="pmid5916640">{{cite journal |author=Laron Z, Pertzelan A, Mannheimer S |title=Genetic pituitary dwarfism with high serum concentration of growth hormone—a new inborn error of metabolism? |journal=Isr.

Resistance to GH was first reported by Laron in 1966. Since then, severe resistance to GH, characterized by grossly impaired growth despite normal levels of GH in [[blood plasma|serum]], has been termed Laron syndrome.

==Pathophysiology==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Laron syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of [[Biological inheritance|inheritance]].]]

Molecular [[gene]]tic investigations have shown that this disorder is mainly associated with [[mutation]]s in the gene for the GH receptor. These can result in defective [[hormone]] binding to the ectodomain or reduced efficiency of dimerization of the receptor after hormone occupancy. There are exceptionally low levels of [[insulin-like growth factor]] ([[IGF-1]]) and its principal [[carrier protein]], [[insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3]]. 

A related condition involving postreceptor insensitivity to growth hormone has been associated with [[STAT5B]].<ref name="pmid17389811">{{cite journal |author=Hwa V, Camacho-Hübner C, Little BM, ''et al.'' |title=Growth hormone insensitivity and severe short stature in siblings: a novel mutation at the exon 13-intron 13 junction of the STAT5b gene |journal=Horm.

==Clinical characteristics==
The principal feature of Laron syndrome is abnormally short stature ([[dwarfism]]).  Physical symptoms include: prominent forehead, depressed [[nasal bridge]], underdevelopment of [[mandible]], truncal [[obesity]]<ref name="pmid16817829">{{cite journal |author=Laron Z, Ginsberg S, Lilos P, Arbiv M, Vaisman N |title=Body composition in untreated adult patients with Laron syndrome (primary GH insensitivity) |journal=Clin.

The majority of reported cases have been of Arabic or [[Semitic]] origin, with numerous patients in Israel, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq, and remote villages in Ecuador with [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] roots.<ref name="roots">{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3001845|last1=Guevara-Aguirre|first1=J|last2=Balasubramanian|first2=P|last3=Guevara-Aguirre|first3=M|last4=Wei|first4=M|last5=Madia|first5=F|last6=Cheng|first6=CW|last7=Hwang|first7=D|last8=Martin-Montalvo|first8=A|last9=Saavedra|first9=J|title=Growth Hormone Receptor Deficiency Is Associated with a Major Reduction in Pro-Aging Signaling, Cancer, and Diabetes in Humans|url=http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/3/70/70ra13.abstract|journal=Science Translational Medicine|volume=3|issue=70|pages=70ra13|year=2011|pmid=21325617|pmc=3357623}}</ref><ref name=nyt>{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/science/17longevity.html?_r=1&hpw |title=Ecuadorean Villagers May Hold Secret to Longevity|first=Nicholas |last=Wade |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=17 February 2011  |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Administration of GH has no effect on IGF-1 production, therefore treatment is mainly by  biosynthetic IGF-1.  IGF-1 must be taken before [[puberty]] to be effective.<ref name=nyt />

IPLEX (Mecasermin rinfabate) is composed of recombinant human [[IGF-1]] (rhIGF-1) and its binding protein [[IGFBP-3]]. It was  approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2005 for treatment of primary IGF-1 deficiency or GH gene deletion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kemp|first=S.F.|title=Mecasermin rinfabate|url=http://journals.prous.com/journals/servlet/xmlxsl/pk_journals.xml_summary_pr?p_JournalId=4&p_RefId=1079876&p_IsPs=N|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Meyer|first=Robert|title=Approval letter (Mecasermin rinfabate)|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2005/021884_s000_Iplex_Approv.pdf|publisher=FDA|accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref> Side effects from IPLEX are hypoglycemia.

IPLEX's manufacturing company, Insmed, can no longer develop proteins and can no longer manufacture IPLEX as of a statement released in January 2012.

==Prognosis==
People with Laron syndrome have strikingly low rates of cancer and [[diabetes]].<ref name=nyt />

==Homo floresiensis==
Recent publications have proposed that ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'' represented a population with widespread Laron syndrome.<ref name="pmid17596857">{{cite journal |author=Hershkovitz I, Kornreich L, Laron Z |title=Comparative skeletal features between Homo floresiensis and patients with primary growth hormone insensitivity (Laron syndrome) |journal=Am.
