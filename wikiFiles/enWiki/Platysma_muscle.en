The platysma is a [[:wikt:superficial|superficial]] [[muscle]] that overlaps the [[sternocleidomastoid]].

It is a broad sheet arising from the [[fascia]] covering the upper parts of the [[pectoralis major]] and [[deltoid_muscle|deltoid]]; its fibers cross the [[clavicle]], and proceed obliquely upward and medially along the side of the neck.

The anterior fibers interlace, below and behind the [[symphysis menti]], with the fibers of the muscle of the opposite side; the posterior fibers cross the [[Human mandible|mandible]], some being inserted into the bone below the oblique line, others into the skin and [[subcutaneous]] tissue of the lower part of the face.  Many of these fibers blend with the muscles about the angle and lower part of the mouth.

Sometimes fibers can be traced to the [[zygomaticus]],{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}} or to the margin of the [[orbicularis oris]]. Beneath the platysma, the external [[jugular]] vein descends from the angle of the mandible to the clavicle.

==Variations==
Variations occur in the extension over the face and over the clavicle and shoulder; it may be absent or interdigitate with the muscle of the opposite side in front of the neck; attachment to clavicle, mastoid process or occipital bone occurs. A more or less independent [[Muscle fascicle|fasciculus]], the [[occipitalis]] minor, may extend from the fascia over the [[trapezius]] to fascia over the insertion of the [[sternocleidomastoideus]].

==Nerve==
The platysma is supplied by the Facial nerve (CN VII).<ref>Anatomy & Physiology, 8th Edition, McGraw-Hill Co., 2008.</ref>

==Actions==
When the entire platysma is in action it produces a slight wrinkling of the surface of the skin of the neck in an oblique direction. Its anterior portion, the thickest part of the muscle, depresses the lower jaw; it also serves to draw down the lower lip and angle of the mouth in the expression of melancholy, i.e. grimacing.  Another way to visualize this muscle is looking at [http://cdn.buzznet.com/media-cdn/jj1/headlines/2010/06/ben-stiller-little-fockers.jpg this picture]: without the platysma, Robert De Niro could not make the expression shown in the picture or more famously do his signature face and say "Lil' Bit" (from the movie Goodfellas).
