'''Pre-eclampsia''' or '''preeclampsia''' is a [[medical condition]] characterized by [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and significant amounts of [[proteinuria|protein in the urine]] of a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman. If left untreated, it can develop into [[eclampsia]], the life-threatening occurrence of [[seizures]] during pregnancy.

There are many different causes for the condition. It appears likely that there are substances from the [[placenta]] that can cause [[endothelial dysfunction]] in the maternal blood vessels of susceptible women.<ref name=DrifeMagowan>Drife JO, Magowan (eds). ''Clinical Obstetrics and Gynaecology'', chapter 39, pp 367-370. ISBN 0-7020-1775-2.</ref> While [[blood pressure]] elevation is the most visible sign of the disease, it involves generalised damage to the maternal [[endothelium]], [[kidney]]s, and [[liver]], with the release of [[vasoconstrictive]] factors being a consequence of the original damage.

Pre-eclampsia may develop from 20 weeks' gestation (it is considered early onset before 32 weeks, which is associated with an increased [[morbidity]]). Its progress differs among patients; most cases are diagnosed before [[Childbirth|labor]] typically would begin. Pre-eclampsia may also occur up to six weeks after delivery. Apart from [[Caesarean section]] and [[induction of labor]] (and therefore delivery of the placenta), there is no known cure. It is the most common of the dangerous pregnancy complications; it may affect both the mother and fetus.<ref name=DrifeMagowan/>

==Diagnosis==

===Criteria===
Pre-eclampsia is diagnosed when a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman develops high blood pressure (two separate readings taken at least six hours apart of 140 or more in systolic blood pressure and/or 90 or more in diastolic blood pressure) ''and'' 300&nbsp;mg of protein in a 24-hour urine sample ([[proteinuria]]). A rise in baseline blood pressure (BP) of 30&nbsp;[[mmHg]] systolic or 15&nbsp;mmHg diastolic, while not meeting the absolute criteria of 140/90, is still considered important to note, but is not considered diagnostic. 

"Severe pre-eclampsia" involves a BP over 160/110<ref name="urlMATERNITY GUIDE - Labor & Delivery">{{cite web |url=http://familymed.uthscsa.edu/residency/maternityguide/labor&delivery.htm |title=MATERNITY GUIDE - Labor & Delivery |work= |accessdate=2010-01-02}}</ref><ref name="urlPre-eclampsia and High Blood Pressure During Pregnancy : University of Michigan Health System">{{cite web |url=http://health.med.umich.edu/healthcontent.cfm?xyzpdqabc=0&id=6&action=detail&AEProductID=HW_Knowledgebase&AEArticleID=hw2834 |title=Pre-eclampsia and High Blood Pressure During Pregnancy : University of Michigan Health System |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-01-02}}</ref> with additional symptoms.

===Other symptoms===
Swelling or [[edema]] (especially in the hands and face) was originally considered an important sign for a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, but in current medical practice only hypertension <ref name="microlife pregnancy validated blood pressure monitrs">{{cite web |url=http://www.microlife.com/healthguide/hypertension/validations/pregnancy|title=Hypertension - Validations - Pregnancy|publisher=microlife.com}}</ref> and proteinuria are necessary for a diagnosis. [[Pitting edema]] (unusual swelling, particularly of the hands, feet, or face, notable by leaving an indentation when pressed on) can be significant, and should be reported to a health care provider.

Although eclampsia is potentially fatal (2% of cases), pre-eclampsia is often [[asymptomatic]], and so its detection depends on signs or investigations. Nonetheless, one symptom is crucially important because it is often misinterpreted: [[epigastric]] pain may be confused with [[heartburn]], a common problem of pregnancy. In general, none of the signs of pre-eclampsia are specific, and even convulsions in pregnancy are more likely to have causes other than eclampsia in modern practice. Diagnosis, therefore, depends on finding a coincidence of several pre-eclamptic features, the final proof being their regression after delivery.

Some women develop high blood pressure without proteinuria (protein in urine), which is called [[pregnancy-induced hypertension]] ('''PIH''') or gestational hypertension. Both pre-eclampsia and PIH are regarded as very serious conditions and require careful monitoring of mother and baby.

===Emerging predictive tests===
[[Blood test]] for quantification of the substances [[placental growth factor]] (PlGF) and [[soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1]] (sFLT-1) in late first or second trimester appear to predict early-onset
pre-eclampsia with a high [[sensitivity and specificity]].<ref name=Andraweera2012>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dms011}}</ref> [[Vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) family proteins do not have sufficient [[statistical power]] to accurately predict late-onset pre-eclampsia, but may be useful in detection of early-onset pre-eclampsia.<ref name=Andraweera2012/>

In November 2011, a new test was announced that involves checking patients' urine for specific cells called [[podocytes]]. Out of the 300 women tested, all the women who went on to have pre-eclampsia were found to have podocytes in their urine, whilst none of the women who had a normal pregnancy, or who suffered from [[pregnancy-induced hypertension]], tested positive for podocytes.<ref name="BBC News - Pre-eclampsia predicted using test during pregnancy">{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15694021 |title=BBC News - Pre-eclampsia predicted using test during pregnancy|work= |accessdate = 2011-11-22 |date=2011-11-12}}</ref><ref name="Mechanisms and Management of Hypertension in Pregnant Women.">{{cite web |url=http://lib.bioinfo.pl/pmid:21656283 |title=Mechanisms and Management of Hypertension in Pregnant Women.|work= |accessdate = 2011-11-22}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Pre-eclampsia affects approximately 6-8% of all pregnancies worldwide,<ref>World Health Organization (WHO). World health report 2005: make every mother and child count. Geneva: WHO; 2005, page 63</ref> with onset of symptoms in the late second or third trimester, most commonly after the 32nd week. Some women will experience pre-eclampsia as early as 20 weeks, though this is rare. It is much more common in women who are pregnant for the first time,<ref>Robbins and Cotran, ''Pathological Basis of Disease, 7th ed.''</ref> and its frequency drops significantly in second pregnancies. While change of paternity in a subsequent pregnancy is now thought to lower risk except in those with a family history of hypertensive pregnancy,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hjartardottir S, Leifsson BG, Geirsson RT, Steinthorsdottir V |title=Paternity change and the recurrence risk in familial hypertensive disorder in pregnancy |journal=Hypertension in Pregnancy |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=219–25 |year=2004 |pmid=15369654 |doi=10.1081/PRG-120037889}}</ref> since increasing maternal age raises risk,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhang J |title=Partner change, birth interval and risk of pre-eclampsia: a paradoxical triangle |journal=Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology |volume=21 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=31–5 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17593195 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3016.2007.00835.x}}</ref> it has been difficult to evaluate how significant paternity change actually is and studies are providing conflicting data on this point.

Pre-eclampsia is also more common in women who have preexisting [[hypertension]], [[diabetes]], [[autoimmune]] diseases such as [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]], various inherited thrombophilias such as [[Factor V Leiden]], [[chronic renal failure|renal disease]], women with a family history of pre-eclampsia, obese women, and women with a multiple gestation ([[twins]] or [[multiple birth]]). The single most significant risk for developing pre-eclampsia is having had pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy.

Pre-eclampsia may also occur in the immediate post-partum period. This is referred to as "postpartum pre-eclampsia". The most dangerous time for the mother is the 24–48 hours postpartum and careful attention should be paid to pre-eclampsia signs and symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Munjuluri N, Lipman M, Valentine A, Hardiman P, Maclean AB |title=Postpartum eclampsia of late onset |journal=BMJ |volume=331 |issue=7524 |pages=1070–1 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16269495 |pmc=1283194 |doi=10.1136/bmj.331.7524.1070}}</ref>

==Causes==
The pre-eclampsia syndrome is thought in many cases to be caused by a shallowly implanted placenta which becomes [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]], leading to an immune reaction characterized by secretion of upregulated [[inflammation|inflammatory]] mediators from the [[placenta]], and acting on the vascular [[endothelium]]. The shallow implantation is thought to stem from the maternal [[immune system]]'s response to the placenta and refers to evidence suggesting a lack of established [[immunological tolerance in pregnancy]]. This results in an [[immune response]] against paternal [[antigens]] from the fetus and its placenta.<ref name="Burne">{{cite news | last=Burne | first=Jerome | title=Give Sperm a Fighting Chance | publisher=The Times | date=2006-01-30 | accessdate=2007-11-16 | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/our_experts/article721663.ece}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In some cases of pre-eclampsia it is thought that the mother lacks the receptors for the proteins the placenta is using to downregulate the maternal immune system's response to it.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moffett A, Hiby SE |title=How Does the maternal immune system contribute to the development of pre-eclampsia? |journal=Placenta |volume=28 |issue=Suppl A |pages=S51–6 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17292469 |doi=10.1016/j.placenta.2006.11.008}}</ref> This view is also consistent with evidence showing many [[miscarriages]] to be an immunological disorder where the mother's immune system "unleashes a destructive attack on the tissues of the developing child".<ref name=BBCMiscarriage>{{cite news | title=Immune system 'causes miscarriage' | publisher=BBC News | date=2000-01-20 | accessdate=2007-11-26 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1803978.stm}}</ref>

In many cases of the pre-eclampsia syndrome, however, the maternal response to the placenta appears to have allowed for normal implantation. It is possible that women with higher baseline levels of inflammation stemming from underlying conditions such as chronic hypertension or autoimmune disease may have less tolerance for the inflammatory burden of pregnancy.

If severe, pre-eclampsia progresses to ''fulminant pre-eclampsia,'' with [[headache]]s, visual disturbances, and epigastric pain, and further to the [[HELLP syndrome]] and [[eclampsia]]. [[Placental abruption]] is associated with hypertensive pregnancies. These are [[medical emergency|life-threatening conditions]] for both the developing baby and the mother.

Many theories have attempted to explain why pre-eclampsia arises, and have linked the syndrome to the presence of the following:
* [[endothelial]] cell injury
* immune rejection of the placenta
* compromised placental perfusion
* altered vascular reactivity
* imbalance between [[prostacyclin]] and [[thromboxane]]
* decreased [[glomerular filtration rate]] with retention of salt and water
* decreased intravascular volume
* increased central nervous system irritability
* disseminated intravascular coagulation
* uterine muscle stretch (ischemia)
* dietary factors, including vitamin deficiency
* [[Hughes syndrome]]
* genetic factors<ref name=AMN>{{cite web | author =Courtney Reynolds, MD, William C. Mabie, MD, & Baha M.

* [[Thyroid]] dysfunction: [[Subclinical hypothyroidism]] in early pregnancy, compared with normal thyroid function, has been estimated to increase the risk of pre-eclampsia with an [[odds ratio]] of 1.7.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmr024}}</ref>

The current understanding of the syndrome is as a two-stage process, with a highly variable first stage which predisposes the placenta to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], followed by the release of soluble factors which result in many of the other

==Pathogenesis==
Although much research into the [[etiology]] and mechanism of pre-eclampsia has taken place, its exact pathogenesis remains uncertain. Some studies support notions of inadequate blood supply to the placenta making it release particular hormones or chemical agents that, in mothers predisposed to the condition, leads to damage of the [[endothelium]] (lining of blood vessels), alterations in [[metabolism]], [[inflammation]], and other possible reactions.<ref name=DrifeMagowan/>

Abnormalities in the maternal [[immune system]] and insufficiency of [[gestational immune tolerance]] seem to play major roles in pre-eclampsia. One of the main differences found in pre-eclampsia is a shift toward [[Th1 response|Th<sub>1</sub> responses]] and the production of [[IFN-γ]]. The origin of IFN-γ is not clearly identified and could be the [[natural killer cell]]s of the uterus, the [[placental dendritic cell]]s modulating responses of [[T helper cells]], alterations in synthesis of or response to regulatory molecules, or changes in the function of [[regulatory T cell]]s in pregnancy.<ref name=Laresgoiti-Servitje>{{cite journal |author=Laresgoiti-Servitje E, Gómez-López N, Olson DM |title=An immunological insight into the origins of pre-eclampsia |journal=Hum Reprod Update |volume= 16|issue= 5|pages= 510–24|year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20388637 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmq007 |url=http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/16/5/510?etoc}}</ref> Aberrant immune responses promoting pre-eclampsia may also be due to an altered fetal allorecognition or to inflammatory triggers.<ref name=Laresgoiti-Servitje/> It has been documented that fetal cells such as fetal [[erythroblast]]s as well as [[cell-free fetal DNA]] are increased in the maternal circulation in women who develop pre-eclampsia. These findings have given rise to the hypothesis that pre-eclampsia is a disease process by which a placental lesion such as hypoxia allows increased fetal material into maternal circulation that leads to an [[immune response]] and endothelial damage ultimately resulting in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.

Some studies suggest that [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] resulting from inadequate perfusion upregulates [[sFlt-1]], a [[Vascular endothelial growth factor|VEGF]] and PlGF antagonist, leading to a damaged maternal endothelium and restriction of placental growth.<ref name="JClinInvest2003-Maynard">{{cite journal |author=Maynard SE, Min JY, Merchan J, ''et al.'' |title=Excess placental soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1) may contribute to endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and proteinuria in preeclampsia |journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=111 |issue=5 |pages=649–58 |year=2003 |month=March |pmid=12618519 |pmc=151901 |doi=10.1172/JCI17189}}</ref> In addition, [[endoglin]], a TGF-beta antagonist, is elevated in pregnant women who develop pre-eclampsia.<ref name="PreE">{{cite journal |author=Venkatesha S, Toporsian M, Lam C, ''et al.'' |title=Soluble endoglin contributes to the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=642–9 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16751767 |doi=10.1038/nm1429}}</ref> Soluble endoglin is likely upregulated by the placenta in response to an upregulation of cell-surface endoglin produced by the maternal immune system, although there is also the potential that sEng is produced by the maternal endothelium. Levels of both sFlt-1 and sEng increase as severity of disease increases, with levels of sEng surpassing levels of sFlt-1 in [[HELLP syndrome]] cases. Recent data indicate that Gadd45a stress signaling regulates elevated sFlt-1 expression in pre-eclampsia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Xiong Y, Liebermann DA, Tront JS, ''et al.'' |title=Gadd45a stress signaling regulates sFlt-1 expression in pre-eclampsia |journal=Journal of Cellular Physiology |volume=220 |issue=3 |pages=632–9 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19452502 |doi=10.1002/jcp.21800}}</ref>

Both sFlt-1 and sEng are upregulated in all pregnant women to some extent, supporting the idea that hypertensive disease in pregnancy is a normal pregnancy adaptation gone awry. As natural killer cells are intimately involved in placentation and as placentation involves a degree of [[Immune tolerance in pregnancy|maternal immune tolerance]] for a foreign placenta which requires maternal resources for its support, it is not surprising that the maternal immune system might respond more negatively to the arrival of some placentae under certain circumstances, such as a placenta which is more invasive than normal. Initial maternal rejection of the placental cytotrophoblasts may be the cause of the inadequately remodeled [[spiral arteries]] in those cases of pre-eclampsia associated with shallow implantation, leading to downstream hypoxia and the appearance of maternal symptoms in response to upregulated sFlt-1 and sEng.

==Differential diagnosis==
Pre-eclampsia can mimic and be confused with many other diseases, including chronic hypertension, chronic renal disease, primary seizure disorders, gallbladder and [[pancreatic disease]], immune or [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]], [[antiphospholipid syndrome]] and [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]]. It must always be considered a possibility in any pregnant woman beyond 20 weeks of gestation. It is particularly difficult to diagnose when preexisting disease such as [[hypertension]] is present.<ref name=AMN1>{{cite web | title =Pre-eclampsia-Eclampsia | publisher=Armenian Medical Network | work =Diagnosis and management of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia | url=http://www.health.am/gyneco/more/pre-eclampsia_eclampsia/ | year = 2003 | accessdate=2005-11-23}}</ref>

==Complications==
[[Eclampsia]] can occur after the onset of pre-eclampsia. Eclampsia, which is a more serious condition, complicates 1 in 2000 maternities in the United Kingdom and carries a maternal mortality of 1.8 percent.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Douglas KA, Redman CW |title=Eclampsia in the United Kingdom |journal=BMJ |volume=309 |issue=6966 |pages=1395–400 |year=1994 |month=November |pmid=7819845 |pmc=2541348 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7819845 |doi=10.1136/bmj.309.6966.1395}}</ref>
The [[HELLP syndrome]] is more common, probably about 1 in 500 maternities, but may be as dangerous as eclampsia itself. These two major maternal crises can present unheralded by prodromal signs of pre-eclampsia.

Cerebral hemorrhage is a lesion that can kill with pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. In that cerebral hemorrhage is a known complication of severe hypertension in other contexts, it must be assumed that this is a major predisposing factor in this situation, although this has not been proven. Adult respiratory distress syndrome appears to have become more common, it is not known whether this is a consequence of modern methods of respiratory support rather than of the disease itself.

[[Uric acid]] levels may help to predict maternal complications among patients with pre-eclampsia according to a [[systematic review]] and [[decision analysis]].<ref name="pmid19540647">{{cite journal| author=| last1=Koopmans| first1=CM| last2=Van Pampus| first2=MG| last3=Groen| first3=H| last4=Aarnoudse| first4=JG| last5=Van Den Berg| first5=PP| last6=Mol| first6=BW|title=Accuracy of serum uric acid as a predictive test for maternal complications in pre-eclampsia: bivariate meta-analysis and decision analysis|year=2009| pages=8–14| issue=1| volume=146|journal=European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology |pmid=19540647|pmc=|doi=10.1016/j.ejogrb.2009.05.014}}</ref> In this study, the [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] was 68% and [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] was 68%. In this study which assumed a prevalence of maternal complications was 5%, the [[positive predictive value]] of 6.2% and [[negative predictive value]] of 98.6% ( [http://medinformatics.uthscsa.edu/calculator/calc.shtml?calc_dx_SnSp.shtml?prevalence=3&sensitivity=68&specificity=68 click here] to adjust these results for patients at higher or lower risk of maternal complications). In their clinical decision analysis, they presumed initially a distress ratio of 10 (defined as being the expected distress of severe complications valued as 10 times worse than the expected distress of a caesarean section), and under these assumptions, they concluded that there would be the least expected distress from using serum uric acid for clinical decision making. The writers of this study acknowledged that there were significant limitations to their review due to heterogeneity of the individual studies they examined with regards to several variables.

In very rare cases, temporary vision loss can occur due to partial or complete [[cortical blindness]] by petechial hemorrhages and focal vasogenic edema in the [[occipital cortex]].<ref>{{cite pmid|7726272}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|12470768}}</ref>

==Treatment and prevention==
The only known treatments for eclampsia or advancing pre-eclampsia are abortion or [[childbirth|delivery]], either by [[labor induction]] or [[Caesarean section]]. However, post-partum pre-eclampsia may occur up to six weeks following delivery even if symptoms were not present during the pregnancy. Post-partum pre-eclampsia is dangerous to the health of the mother since she may ignore or dismiss symptoms as simple post-delivery headaches and edema. Hypertension can sometimes be controlled with anti-hypertensive medication, but any effect this might have on the progress of the underlying disease is unknown.

Thrombophilias may be weakly linked to pre-eclampsia. There are no high quality studies to suggest that blood thinners will prevent pre-eclampsia in thrombophilic women.<ref>Rodger, AJOG, 2008</ref>

===Smoking cessation===
In low-risk pregnancies the association between cigarette [[smoking]] and a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia has been consistent and reproducible across epidemiologic studies. High-risk pregnancies (those with pregestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, history of pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy, or multifetal gestation) showed no significant protective effect. The reason for this discrepancy is not definitively known; research supports speculation that the underlying pathology increases the risk of pre-eclampsia to such a degree that any measurable reduction of risk due to smoking is swamped.<ref name="pmid18566591">{{cite journal |author=Jeyabalan A, Powers RW, Durica AR, Harger GF, Roberts JM, Ness RB |title=Cigarette Smoke Exposure and Angiogenic Factors in Pregnancy and Preeclampsia |journal=Am.

===Antihypertensive therapy===
[[Antihypertensives]] may reduce maternal and fetal mortality among pregnancy patients with [[hypertension]] as compared to [[placebo]] according to a [[randomized controlled trial]].<ref name="pmid7573260">{{cite journal| author=| last1=Wide-Swensson| first1=DH| last2=Ingemarsson| first2=I| last3=Lunell| first3=NO| last4=Forman| first4=A| last5=Skajaa| first5=K| last6=Lindberg| first6=B| last7=Lindeberg| first7=S| last8=Marsàl| first8=K| last9=Andersson| first9=KE|title=Calcium channel blockade (isradipine) in treatment of hypertension in pregnancy: a randomized placebo-controlled study|year=1995| pages=872–8| issue=3 Pt 1| volume=173|journal=American journal of obstetrics and gynecology |pmid=7573260|pmc=|doi=10.1016/0002-9378(95)90357-7}}</ref> Overall, after three weeks of treatment, [[mean arterial pressure]] was lower in the [[isradipine]] group, but when compared with the placebo group, the difference in mean arterial pressure did not have [[statistical significance]]. After treatment with [[isradipine]], those patients with no proteinuria experienced a decrease of between 8.5 and 11.3&nbsp;mmHg, whereas those with [[proteinuria]] experienced about only 1&nbsp;mmHg difference in systolic blood pressure. Those treated with placebo in both groups did not experience much change in [[systolic blood pressure]], regardless of [[proteinuria]] being present or not. Therefore, the authors concluded proteinuric patients may respond differently from nonproteinuric patients to this treatment, where the nonproteinuric patients responded the most to treatment with isradipine.

[[Labetolol]] or [[Nifedipine]] are often the antihypertensives of choice for eclampsia or pre-eclampsia according to the CHEST 2007 study{{Clarify|date=September 2012}}, especially Labetolol as it has little placental transfer.

The target blood pressure has been proposed to be 140-160 mmHg systolic and 90-105 mmHg diastolic, although some sources recommend lower values.<ref>[http://www.nvog-documenten.nl/uploaded/docs/Hypertensieve%20aandoeningen/Hypertensive_disorders_in_pregnancy%5B1%5D.pdf Hypertensive Disorders in Pregnancy.

===Magnesium sulfate===
In some cases, women with pre-eclampsia or eclampsia can be stabilized temporarily with [[magnesium sulfate]] intravenously to forestall seizures while steroid injections are administered to promote fetal lung maturation. Magnesium sulfate as a possible treatment was considered at least as far back as 1955,<ref>{{cite journal |author=PRITCHARD JA |title=The use of the magnesium ion in the management of eclamptogenic toxemias |journal=Surgery, Gynecology & Obstetrics |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=131–40 |year=1955 |month=February |pmid=13238166}}</ref> but only in recent years did its use in the UK replace the use of [[diazepam]] or [[phenytoin]].<ref>Compare descriptions in 1977 between a British and American paper.<br>* {{cite journal |author=Hibbard BM, Rosen M |title=The management of severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia |journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=3–9 |year=1977 |month=January |pmid=831744 |doi=10.1093/bja/49.1.3}}<br>* {{cite journal |author=Andersen WA, Harbert GM |title=Conservative management of pre-eclamptic and eclamptic patients: a re-evaluation |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=260–7 |year=1977 |month=October |pmid=900196}}</ref>

===Induction of paternal tolerance===
Many studies have also suggested the importance of a woman's [[immunological tolerance]] to her baby's father, whose genes are present in the young fetus and its placenta and which may pose a challenge to her immune system.<ref name="Burne"/><ref name="Sex Primes Women for Sperm">{{cite news | title=Sex Primes Women for Sperm | publisher=BBC News | date=2002-02-06 | accessdate=2007-11-19 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1803978.stm}}</ref> As the theory is further investigated,<ref name="Waite">{{cite journal |author=Waite LL, Atwood AK, Taylor RN |title=Pre-eclampsia, an implantation disorder |journal=Reviews in Endocrine & Metabolic Disorders |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=151–8 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=12007292 |doi=10.1023/A:1015411113468}}</ref> researchers are increasingly studying the importance of a woman's continued exposure to her partner's semen as early as several years before conception. One study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology involved several hundreds of women and found that "women with a short period of cohabitation (less than 4 months) who used barrier methods for contraception had a substantially elevated risk for the development of pre-eclampsia compared with women with more than 12 months of cohabitation before conception".<ref name=Einarsson>{{cite journal |author=Einarsson JI, Sangi-Haghpeykar H, Gardner MO |title=Sperm exposure and development of pre-eclampsia |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=188 |issue=5 |pages=1241–3 |year=2003 |month=May |pmid=12748491 |doi=10.1067/mob.2003.401}}</ref> However, the results from a study conducted in 2004 show that the theory is still not conclusive. In that study, the researchers found that after adjustment and stratification, the effect of barrier contraceptive use on the development of pre-eclampsia had disappeared, with both arms having identical rates of pre-eclampsia.<ref name=Ness>{{cite journal |author=Ness RB, Markovic N, Harger G, Day R |title=Barrier methods, length of preconception intercourse, and pre-eclampsia |journal=Hypertension in Pregnancy |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=227–35 |year=2004 |pmid=15617622 |doi=10.1081/PRG-200030293}}</ref> Although the study has since been criticized for its subjective adjustment of data, it remains important because it demonstrates that there is still some contention over the degree to which failure of tolerance induction can be attributed to prior exposure to the partner's sperm.

Continued exposure to a partner's semen has a strong protective effect against pre-eclampsia, largely due to the absorption of several immune modulating factors present in seminal fluid.<ref name="Robertson">{{cite web | author= Sarah Robertson| title=Research Goals --> Role of seminal fluid signalling in the female reproductive tract | url=http://health.adelaide.edu.au/og/people/robertsons.html}}</ref><ref name=SeminalPriming>{{cite journal |author=Robertson SA, Bromfield JJ, Tremellen KP |title=Seminal 'priming' for protection from pre-eclampsia-a unifying hypothesis |journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=253–65 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12896827 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(03)00052-4}}</ref>

Long periods of sexual cohabitation with the same partner fathering a woman's child significantly decreased her chances of suffering pre-eclampsia.<ref name=Einarsson/><ref name="SeminalPriming"/> As one early study described, "although pre-eclampsia is a disease of first pregnancies, the protective effect of multiparity is lost with change of partner".<ref name=Dekk9618714>{{cite journal |author=Dekker GA, Robillard PY, Hulsey TC |title=Immune maladaptation in the etiology of pre-eclampsia: a review of corroborative epidemiologic studies |journal=Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey |volume=53 |issue=6 |pages=377–82 |year=1998 |month=June |pmid=9618714 |doi=10.1097/00006254-199806000-00023}}</ref> The study also concluded that although women with changing partners are strongly advised to use condoms to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, "a certain period of sperm exposure within a stable relation, when pregnancy is aimed for, is associated with protection against pre-eclampsia".<ref name="Dekk9618714"/>

Several other studies have since investigated the strongly decreased incidence of pre-eclampsia in women who had received blood transfusions from their partner, those with long, preceding histories of sex without barrier contraceptives, and in women who had been regularly performing [[oral sex]],<ref name=Elizabeth_Bonney>{{cite journal |author=Bonney EA |title=Preeclampsia: A view through the danger model |journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology |volume=76 |issue=1–2 |pages=68–74 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=17482268 |pmc=2246056 |doi=10.1016/j.jri.2007.03.006}}</ref><ref name="pmid10706945">{{cite journal |author=Koelman CA, Coumans AB, Nijman HW, Doxiadis II, Dekker GA, Claas FH |title=Correlation between oral sex and a low incidence of pre-eclampsia: a role for soluble HLA in seminal fluid? |journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=155–66 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10706945 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(99)00062-5}}</ref> with one study concluding "induction of allogeneic tolerance to the paternal [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) molecules of the fetus may be crucial. Data collected strongly suggest that exposure, and especially oral exposure to soluble HLA from semen can lead to transplantation tolerance."<ref name="pmid10706945"/>

According to the theory, the fetus and placenta both contain "foreign" proteins from paternal genes, but regular, preceding and coincident exposure to the father's semen may promote immune acceptance and subsequent implantation, a process which is significantly supported by as many as 93 currently identified immune regulating factors in seminal fluid.<ref name="Burne"/><ref name="Sex Primes Women for Sperm"/>

Having already noted the importance of a woman's [[immunological tolerance]] to her baby's paternal genes, several Dutch reproductive biologists decided to take their research a step further. Consistent with the fact that human immune systems tolerate things better when they enter the body via the mouth, the Dutch researchers conducted a series of studies that confirmed a surprisingly strong correlation between a diminished incidence of pre-eclampsia and a woman's practice of oral sex, and noted that the protective effects were strongest if she swallowed her partner's semen.<ref name="Elizabeth_Bonney"/><ref name="pmid10706945"/><ref name=NewScientist>{{cite news | last=Fox | first=Douglas | title=Gentle Persuasion | publisher=The New Scientist | date=2002-02-09 | accessdate=2007-06-17 | url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17323294.200-gentle-persuasion.html}}</ref><ref name = mattar_sexual_behavior>{{cite journal |author=Mattar R, Soares RV, Daher S |title=Sexual behavior and recurrent spontaneous abortion |journal=International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=154–5 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15694097 |doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2004.11.006}}</ref><ref name=Orgasmic_Pregnancy>{{cite book | author = Danielle Cavallucci, and Yvonne K.

A team from the [[University of Adelaide]] has also investigated to see if men who have fathered pregnancies which have ended in [[miscarriage]] or pre-eclampsia had low seminal levels of critical immune modulating factors such as [[TGF-Beta]]. The team has found that certain men, dubbed "dangerous males", are several times more likely to father pregnancies that would end in either pre-eclampsia or [[miscarriage]].<ref name="SeminalPriming"/> Among other things, most of the "dangerous males" seemed to lack sufficient levels of the seminal immune factors necessary to induce [[immunological tolerance]] in their partners.<ref name=Dekker_Partner_Role>{{cite journal |author=Dekker G |title=The partner's role in the etiology of pre-eclampsia |journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology |volume=57 |issue=1–2 |pages=203–15 |year=2002 |pmid=12385843 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(02)00039-6}}</ref>

===Administration of immune factors===
As the theory of immune intolerance as a cause of pre-eclampsia has become accepted, women who suffer repeated pre-eclampsia, miscarriages, or [[IVF|In Vitro Fertilization]] failures could potentially be administered key immune factors such as [[TGF-beta]] along with the father's foreign proteins, possibly either orally, as a sublingual spray, or as a vaginal gel to be applied onto the vaginal wall before intercourse.<ref name="SeminalPriming"/>

In 2006, researchers at the [[University of Adelaide]] developed a gel containing TGF-Beta for use in human populations.<ref name=Infertility_Drug>"Reproductive health researchers develop infertility drug technology," Thursday, 16 February 2006, http://www.adelaide.edu.au/news/news9761.html</ref> Later, [[GroPep]], the company which was awarded the patent on a TGF-Beta3 variant, conducted trials where the [[miscarriage]] rate was halved in the mice studied. According to a GroPep news release later published, "a faulty immune response is implicated in the etiology of as many as 50% of all [[miscarriages]]."<ref name=Gropep_news_release_2006>News Release; 14 September 2006; GROPEP COMPLETES PHASE 1a INFERTILITY TRIAL; http://www.bioinnovationsa.com.au/resources/123/GroPep%20Press%20Release%20(Sep-06)%20140906.pdf</ref> Their drug, PV903, was "targeted to treat recurrent miscarriages caused by an abnormal immune response to the [[foetus]], a condition for which there is no current [drug] treatment." <ref name="Gropep_news_release_2006"/> Stage I clinical trials of their vaginal gel were partly successful, succeeding in establishing the safety of the drug, but failing in their aim of increasing the number of specific immune cells measured in circulation, the necessary condition for affecting a desired immunological desensitization.<ref name="Gropep_news_release_2006"/><ref name=Cameron_England>"GroPep trial mixed"; September 15, 2006; http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,20413971-913,00.html</ref> The trials were later criticized for failing to recognize the synergistic effects of a large variety of immune factors naturally present in seminal fluid, which, acting together and with the localized presence of the foreign paternal proteins, modulate the female immune response so as to allow for implantation, and then the subsequent immune acceptance of the (foreign) [[fetus]] throughout a successful pregnancy. GroPep was later acquired by the large biotechnology company [[Novozymes]]. The development of the PV903 drug has since been suspended.
