'''Liposarcoma''' is a [[malignant]] [[tumor]]<ref name="pmid10982304">{{cite journal |author=Dei Tos AP |title=Liposarcoma: new entities and evolving concepts |journal=Ann Diagn Pathol |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=252â€“66 |year=2000 |month=August |pmid=10982304 |doi=10.1053/adpa.2000.8133 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1092-9134(00)74153-0}}</ref> that arises in [[Adipose tissue|fat cells]] in deep [[soft tissue]], such as that inside the thigh or in the [[retroperitoneum]]. 

They are typically large bulky tumors which tend to have multiple smaller satellites extending beyond the main confines of the tumor. 

Liposarcomas, like all [[sarcoma]]s, are rare.<ref name="centers">{{cite web|author=Goldstein-Rice, E|year=2008|title=The Importance of Treatment at a Specialty Center for Sarcomas|work=ESUN|url=http://sarcomahelp.org/learning_center/articles/sarcoma_centers.html}}</ref>

==Symptoms==

Patients usually note a deep seated mass in their soft tissue. Only when the tumor is very large do symptoms of pain or functional disturbances occur. 

Retroperitoneal tumors may present themselves with signs of [[weight loss]] and [[emaciation]] and [[abdominal pain]]. These tumors may also compress the kidney or ureter leading to [[kidney failure]].

==Diagnosis==

[[Image:Dedifferentiated_liposarcoma_-_intermed_mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of a dedifferentiated liposarcoma. A dedifferentiated liposarcoma has a poorly differentiated component, that is not identifiable as a liposarcoma (left edge of image), and a [[Cellular_differentiation|differentiated]] component with lipoblasts and increased [[blood vessels|vascularity]] (right of image). Morphologically benign [[adipose tissue]] (center of image) has few blood vessels.  [[H&E stain]].]]
The diagnosis is established by [[histologic]] examination of the tissue, i.e. [[biopsy]] or excisional biopsy.  ''Lipoblasts'' are often present; these are cells with an abundant clear multi-[[vacuole|vacuolated]] [[cytoplasm]] and an eccentric darkly staining nucleus that is indented by the vacuoles.

===Subtypes===
Several subtypes of liposarcoma exist:
* Well-differentiated liposarcoma, synonymous with atypical lipomatous tumor; the former term is used almost exclusively for lesions in the [[retroperitoneum]], while the latter is used for lesions arising elsewhere.
* Dedifferentiated liposarcoma, which consists of well-differentiated liposarcoma adjacent to a more poorly differentiated tumor.
* Myxoid/round cell liposarcoma.
* Pleomorphic liposarcoma.

==Incidence and prevalence==
Most frequent in middle-aged and older adults (age 40 and above), liposarcomas are the second most common of all soft-tissue [[sarcoma]]s following [[malignant fibrous histiocytoma]]s. Annually 2.5 cases occur per million population.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis varies depending on the site of origin, the type of cancer cell, the tumor size, the depth, and proximity to lymph nodes. Well-differentiated liposarcomas treated with surgery and radiation have a low recurrence rate (about 10%) and rarely metastasize.<ref name="liposarcoma">{{cite web|author=Gebhardt, M and Buecker, PJ|year=2004|title=Liposarcoma |work=ESUN|url=http://sarcomahelp.org/liposarcoma.html}}</ref> Five-year survival rates vary from 100% to 39% based on histological subtype.<ref name="liposarcoma" /> <!-- 2.5 cases per million is international, same site.  -->
