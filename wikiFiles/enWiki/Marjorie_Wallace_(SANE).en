'''Marjorie Shiona Wallace''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (Countess Skarbeck) (born 10 January 1945<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/article5484753.ece ''[[The Times]]'' 10 January 2009, Retrieved 2010-01-09]</ref> in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] writer, broadcaster and investigative journalist<ref name=guardian>[http://society.guardian.co.uk/pictures/image/0,,-1020329497405,00.html ''[[The Guardian]]'']</ref> and is the [[chief executive]] of [[SANE (charity)|SANE]], a mental health charity in the UK established in 1986. 

==Early career==
{{Refimprove-section|date=May 2013}}
Wallace has a degree in [[Psychology]] and [[Philosophy]] from [[University College, London]]. On leaving university she worked as a trainee producer for ''The Frost Programme'' with [[David Frost]] (1966-68), and went on to become a religious programmes producer, and a current affairs reporter for [[London Weekend Television]] (1969-72).<ref>[http://society.guardian.co.uk/mentalhealth/story/0,,1438237,00.html ''[[The Guardian]]'' March 16 2005]</ref>  However, she made her mark as an investigative journalist for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' (1972-89), for whom, as the paper's Social Services Correspondent, she wrote a series of articles in 1972 highlighting the financial and emotional plight of the [[Thalidomide]] children who had been born in the 1950s and 1960s with physical disabilities. As a result of this campaign she met [[Terry Wiles]], about whom she collaborated on a biography, ''[[On Giant's Shoulders]]'' (1976). This was to be made into a [[BBC]] ''[[Play for Today]]'' in 1979 in which Wallace was portrayed by [[Annabel Leventon]].

Other investigations as a ''[[Sunday Times]]'' journalist ranged from the failure of concrete systems building and the 'hot-housing' of genius children to the [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|Dioxin]] disaster in [[Northern Italy]] about which she co-wrote the book ''Superpoison''.

==SANE==
{{Refimprove-section|date=May 2013}}
SANE was founded by Wallace after an overwhelming public response to a series of articles written by her in ''[[The Times]]'' "The Forgotten Illness". The articles underscored the neglect of people suffering from [[schizophrenia]] and the paucity of services and treatments. From its initial focus on schizophrenia, SANE developed and is now concerned with all mental illnesses.

Through her network of politicians, businessmen, academics and donors, she helped raise over Â£20 million through SANE for people with mental health problems and has created [[The Prince of Wales International Centre for SANE Research]] in Oxford. SANE pioneered the UK's first national out-of-hours mental health helpline offering practical information and emotional support 365 days a year. [[Charles, Prince of Wales|HRH The Prince of Wales]] has said of her work: 'There are shining examples of what can be done, such as a series of articles by Marjorie Wallace, which not only laid the foundation of contemporary understanding of mental illness but also led directly to the foundation of SANE, of which I am Patron.' 
 
She is probably best known for her book ''[[June and Jennifer Gibbons|The Silent Twins]]'' and the film made from her screenplay which was voted best docudrama in the [[USA]] in 1988. She wrote and presented provocative television documentaries - ''Whose Mind is it Anyway?'' and ''Circles of Madness'' - and gained a reputation as an international lecturer and broadcaster on the subject of mental illness.

==Honours and awards==
She has won numerous awards for her journalism and books: as a journalist for ''[[The Times]]'' she was awarded ''Campaigning Journalist of the Year'' for 1988. Wallace has also been ''Medical Journalist of the Year'' and she received a British Neuroscience Association award in 2002.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article2036282.ece ''[[The Times]]'' online July 8, 2007]</ref>

As a result of her "The Forgotten Illness" articles and her subsequent work in the mental illness field she was elected an honorary Fellow of the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] in 2001.<ref name=guardian/> Wallace was appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in 1994, and an honorary [[Doctorate of Science]] by [[City University, London]] in 2001. Since 1990 she has been a Fellow of [[University College, London]].<ref>City University List of Alumni</ref>

In 2006 she was selected as one of the 16 key achievers who had made a difference to the health of the nation for an exhibition at the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] <ref>{{cite web|title=Marjorie Wallace (Countess Skarbeck)|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw122005/Marjorie-Wallace-Countess-Skarbeck?LinkID=mp86200&role=sit&rNo=0|publisher=National Portrait Gallery}}</ref> and, two years later, was chosen as one of the 60 most influential people in shaping the history of the [[National Health Service]].

She was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[New Year Honours 2008|2008 New Year Honours]].
