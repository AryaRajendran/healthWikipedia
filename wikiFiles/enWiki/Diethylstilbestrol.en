'''Diethylstilbestrol''' ('''DES''', former [[British Approved Name|BAN]] '''stilboestrol''') is a synthetic nonsteroidal [[estrogen]] that was first synthesized in 1938. It is also classified as an [[endocrine disruptor]]. Human exposure to DES occurred through diverse sources, such as dietary ingestion from supplemented cattle feed and medical treatment for certain conditions, including breast and prostate cancers. From about 1940 to 1970, DES was given to pregnant women in the mistaken belief it would reduce the risk of pregnancy complications and losses. In 1971, DES was shown to cause a rare vaginal tumor in girls and women who had been exposed to this drug ''[[in utero]]''. The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] subsequently withdrew DES from use in pregnant women. Follow-up studies have indicated DES also has the potential to cause a variety of significant adverse medical complications during the lifetimes of those exposed.<ref name="urlDES Update: For Consumers.

Individuals who were exposed to DES during their mothers' pregnancies are commonly referred to as "DES daughters" and "DES sons".

==Synthesis==
DES was first synthesized in early 1938 by Leon Golberg, then a graduate student of [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Sir Robert Robinson]] at the [[Dyson Perrins Laboratory]] at the [[University of Oxford]], based on a formulation of Wilfrid Lawson at the Courtauld Institute of Biochemistry, led by [[Charles Dodds|Sir Edward Charles Dodds]] at [[Middlesex Hospital#Middlesex Hospital Medical School|Middlesex Hospital Medical School]] now part of [[University College London]], and a report of its synthesis was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on 5 February 1938.<ref name=dodds1>{{cite journal | author = Dodds EC, Goldberg L, Lawson W, Robinson R | year =1938 | title = Estrogenic activity of certain synthetic compounds | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 141 | issue = 3562 | pages = 247–8 | doi = 10.1038/141247b0 }}</ref><ref name=dodds2>{{cite book | author = Dodds EC | year = 1957 | title = Biochemical contributions to endocrinology; experiments in hormonal research | location = Stanford | publisher = Stanford University Press | oclc = 1483899}}</ref><ref name=meyers>{{cite book | author = Meyers R | year = 1983 | title = D.E.S., the bitter pill | location = New York | publisher = Seaview/Putnam | isbn = 0-399-31008-8 }}</ref>

DES was first synthesized by English university research funded by the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|MRC]], which had a policy against patenting drugs discovered using public funds. Because it was not patented, DES was produced by more than 200 pharmaceutical and chemical companies worldwide.

==Clinical use==

DES (in tablets up to 5 [[milligram|mg]]) was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] on September 19, 1941 for four indications: [[gonorrhea]]l [[vaginitis]], [[atrophic vaginitis]], [[menopausal]] symptoms, and postpartum [[breastfeeding|lactation]] suppression to prevent breast engorgement.<ref name=meyers/> The gonorrheal vaginitis indication was dropped when the [[antibiotic]] [[penicillin]] became available. From its very inception, the drug was highly controversial.<ref name=langston>{{cite book | author = Langston N | year = 2010 | title = Toxic bodies: Hormone disruptors and the legacy of DES |location=New Haven, CT | publisher = Yale University Press | isbn = 978-0-300-13607-4}}</ref><ref name=seaman>{{cite book | author = Seaman B | year = 2003 | title = The greatest experiment ever performed on women: Exploding the estrogen myth | location = New York | publisher = Hyperion | isbn = 978-0-7868-6853-7 }}</ref>

In 1941, [[Charles Huggins]] and Clarence Hodges at the [[University of Chicago]] found DES to be the first effective drug for treatment of metastatic [[prostate cancer]].<ref name="pmid4625049">{{cite journal | author = Huggins C, Hodges CV | title = Studies on prostatic cancer.

From the 1940s until the late 1980s, DES was FDA-approved as [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|estrogen-replacement therapy]] for estrogen deficiency states such as [[gonadal dysgenesis|ovarian dysgenesis]], [[premature ovarian failure]], and after [[oophorectomy]].

In the 1940s, DES was used off-label to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with a history of miscarriage. On July 1, 1947, the FDA approved the use of DES for this indication. The first such approval was granted to Bristol-Meyers Squibb, allowing use of 25&nbsp;mg (and later 100&nbsp;mg) tablets of DES during pregnancy. Approvals were granted to other pharmaceutical companies later in the same year.<ref name=dutton>{{cite book | author = Dutton DB | year = 1988 | title = Worse than the disease: pitfalls of medical progress | location = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 0-521-34023-3}}</ref> The recommended regimen started at 5&nbsp;mg per day in the seventh and eighth weeks of pregnancy (from first day of last menstrual period), increased every other week by 5&nbsp;mg per day through the 14th week, and then increased every week by 5&nbsp;mg per day from 25&nbsp;mg per day in the 15th week to 125&nbsp;mg per day in the 35th week of pregnancy.<ref name=pdr1961>{{cite book | year = 1961 | title = Physicians' desk reference to pharmaceutical specialties and biologicals | edition = 15th | location = Oradell NJ | publisher = Medical Economics | page = 625 | isbn = 0-00-093447-X }}</ref> DES was originally considered effective and safe for both the [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman and the developing baby. It was aggressively marketed and routinely prescribed. Sales peaked in 1953.

In the early 1950s, a [[double-blind]] clinical trial at the University of Chicago assessed pregnancy outcomes in women who were assigned to either receive or not receive DES.<ref name=dieckmann>{{cite journal | author = Dieckmann WJ, Davis ME, Rynkiewicz LM, Pottinger RE | title = Does the administration of diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy have therapeutic value? | journal = Am.

Despite an absence of evidence supporting the use of DES to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes, DES continued to be given to pregnant women through the 1960s. In 1971, a report published in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' showed a probable link between DES and vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma in girls and young women who had been exposed to this drug ''in utero''. Later in the same year, the FDA sent an FDA Drug Bulletin to all U.S. physicians advising against the use of DES in pregnant women. The FDA also removed prevention of miscarriage as an indication for DES use and added pregnancy as a contraindication for DES use.<ref name=fr1971>{{cite journal | author = United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) | year = 1971 | title = Certain estrogens for oral or parenteral use.

DES was also used in other countries, most notably France, the Netherlands, and Great Britain.

From the 1950s through the beginning of the 1970s, DES was prescribed to prepubescent girls to begin puberty and thus stop growth by closing growth plates in the bones. Despite its clear link to cancer, doctors continued to recommend the hormone for "excess height".<ref>{{Cite web | author = Zuger A | date = 2009-07-27 | title = At What Height, Happiness?

In 1973, in an attempt to restrict off-label use of DES as a [[emergency contraceptive|postcoital contraceptive]] (which had become prevalent at many university health services following publication of an influential study in 1971 in ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]]'') to emergency situations such as rape, an ''FDA Drug Bulletin'' was sent to all U.S. physicians and pharmacists that said the FDA had approved, under restricted conditions, postcoital contraceptive use of DES.<ref name="pmid5171004">{{cite journal | author = Kuchera LK | title = Postcoital contraception with diethylstilbestrol | journal = JAMA | volume = 218 | issue = 4 | pages = 562–3 | year = 1971 | pmid = 5171004 | doi = 10.1001/jama.218.4.562 }}</ref> In 1975, the FDA said it had not actually given (and never did give) approval to any manufacturer to market DES as a postcoital contraceptive, but would approve that indication for emergency situations such as rape or incest if a manufacturer provided patient labeling and special packaging as set out in a FDA final rule published in 1975.<ref>{{cite journal | author = FDA | year = 1975 | title = Diethylstilbestrol as posticoital oral contraceptive; patient labeling | journal = Fed Regist | volume = 40 | issue = 25 | pages = 5451–5 }}; {{Federal Register|40|5451}}</ref> To discourage off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive, the FDA in 1975 removed DES 25&nbsp;mg tablets from the market and ordered the labeling of lower doses (5&nbsp;mg and lower) of DES still approved for other indications changed to state: "This drug product should not be used as a postcoital contraceptive" in block capital letters on the first line of the physician prescribing information package insert and in a prominent and conspicuous location of the container and carton label.<ref name=des25mg>{{cite journal | author = FDA | year = 1975 | title = Certain estrogens for oral use.

==Associated health problems==

=== First generation ===

An estimated 3 million pregnant women in the USA were prescribed DES between the early 1940s and the 1970s. DES was also widely prescribed to women in Canada, the UK, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand during a similar period. Women who were prescribed DES during pregnancy have been shown to have a modestly increased risk of breast cancer and breast cancer mortality.

=== Second generation ===

==== DES daughters ====

DES gained notoriety when it was shown to cause a rare vaginal tumor in girls and young women who had been exposed to this drug ''in utero''. In 1971, the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' published a report showing that seven of eight girls and young women (ages 14 to 22) who had been diagnosed with vaginal clear cell [[adenocarcinoma]] had been exposed prenatally to DES.<ref name=herbst>{{cite journal | author = Herbst AL, Ulfelder H, Poskanzer DC | title = Adenocarcinoma of the vagina.

Med. | volume = 284 | issue = 15 | pages = 878–81 | year = 1971 | pmid = 5549830 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM197104222841604 }}</ref> Subsequent studies have shown an approximate 40-fold increased risk of vaginal/cervical clear cell adenocarcinoma in women exposed ''in utero'' to DES. As a consequence of this evidence, DES is considered an established human carcinogen. DES was one of the first transplacental carcinogens discovered in humans, meaning a toxin could cross the placenta and harm the fetus. It had originally been believed that the placenta protected the developing fetus but we now know that is not true. Daughters exposed to DES ''in utero'' may also have an increased risk of moderate to severe cervical squamous cell dysplasia and an increased risk of breast cancer.<ref name="pmid17390375">{{cite journal | author = Troisi R, Hatch EE, Titus-Ernstoff L, Hyer M, Palmer JR, Robboy SJ, Strohsnitter WC, Kaufman R, Herbst AL, Hoover RN | title = Cancer risk in women prenatally exposed to diethylstilbestrol | journal = Int.

In addition to its carcinogenic properties, DES is a known [[teratogen]], an agent capable of causing malformations in daughters and sons who were exposed ''in utero''. DES-exposed daughters are at an increased risk of abnormalities of the reproductive tract, including vaginal epithelial changes (which as vaginal adenosis, means a type of tissue develops on the surface of the vagina that is not generally found there), an increased cervical transformation zone, and uterine abnormalities, such as [[T-shaped uterus]]. These anomalies contribute to an increased risk of infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes in prenatally DES-exposed daughters. The most recent published research on DES daughters' adverse health outcomes documented by the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) appears in the October 6, 2011 issue of the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' under the authorship of RN Hoover ''et al.'', and lists these adverse effects and risk factors: Cumulative risks in women exposed to DES, as compared with those not exposed, were as follows: for infertility, 33.3% vs. 15.5%; spontaneous abortion, 50.3% vs. 38.6%; preterm delivery, 53.3% vs. 17.8%; loss of second-trimester pregnancy, 16.4% vs. 1.7%; ectopic pregnancy, 14.6% vs. 2.9%; preeclampsia, 26.4% vs. 13.7%; stillbirth, 8.9% vs. 2.6%; early menopause, 5.1% vs. 1.7%; grade 2 or higher cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, 6.9% vs. 3.4%; and breast cancer at 40 years of age or older, 3.9% vs. 2.2%.<ref name="pmid21991952">{{cite journal | author = Hoover RN, Hyer M, Pfeiffer RM, Adam E, Bond B, Cheville AL, Colton T, Hartge P, Hatch EE, Herbst AL, Karlan BY, Kaufman R, Noller KL, Palmer JR, Robboy SJ, Saal RC, Strohsnitter W, Titus-Ernstoff L, Troisi R | title = Adverse health outcomes in women exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol | journal = N.

Initially, fewer studies documented risks of prenatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol on males (referred to as "DES sons").

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) has documented that prenatal DES exposure in males is positively linked to a condition known as [[hypogonadism]] (low testosterone levels) that may require treatment with testosterone replacement therapy.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.aace.com/files/hypo-gonadism.pdf| title = American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Medical Guidelines for Clinical Practice for the Evaluation and Treatment of Hypogonadism in Adult-Male Patients--2002 Update| publisher = American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists }}</ref>

Research on DES sons has explored the hypothesis that the range of effects of prenatal exposure to DES in males might include behavioral or neurological changes, and also [[intersexuality]]. Dr. Scott Kerlin, founder of the DES Sons International Research Network, has documented for the past 15 years a high prevalence of individuals with confirmed or strongly suspected prenatal DES exposure who self-identify as male-to-female [[transsexual]], [[transgender]], and [[intersexed]], and many individuals who have reported experiencing difficulties with [[gender dysphoria]].<ref name="pmid16203228">{{cite journal | author = Hood E | title = Are EDCs blurring issues of gender? | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 113 | issue = 10 | pages = A670–7 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16203228 | pmc = 1281309 | doi =10.1289/ehp.113-a670 }}</ref><ref name = "Blackless_2006">{{cite journal | author = Blackless M, Besser M, Carr S, Cohen-Kettenis PT, Connolly P, De Sutter P, Diamond M, Di Ceglie D, Higashi Y, Jones L, Kruijver FPM, Martin J, Playdon Z-J, Ralph D, Reed T, Reid R, Reiner WG, Swaab D, Terry T, Wilson P, Wylie K | title = Atypical Gender Development – A Review | journal = International Journal of Transgenderism | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–44 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1300/J485v09n01_04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = Rudacille D | title =The Riddle of Gender (Chapter, "Fear of a Pink Planet") | year =2005 | publisher= Pantheon Books | pages= 240–276| isbn =0-375-42162-9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Bao, Ai-Min and Swaab, Dick | title = Sexual differentiation of the human brain: Relation to gender identity, sexual orientation and neuropsychiatric disorders | journal = Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology | volume = 32 | pages = 214–226 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.007 | pmid = 21334362 | issue = 2}}</ref>  These findings in part arose from on an online discussion and support group created for DES exposed men with health concerns.  Although such forums are useful, they tend to produce biased data, simply because they attract individuals who have both the exposure and a health concern, ensuring that the exposure and health concern will be seen as linked.  A large US study, in which recruitment was not dependent on health concerns, and in which DES exposure (or lack of exposure) was confirmed for all participants, found no association between prenatal DES exposure and sexual orientation when the DES-exposed men were compared to unexposed men. However, no research into gender identity issues was explored in this study. <ref name="PMID12606880">{{cite journal | author = Titus-Ernstoff L, Perez K, Hatch EE, Troisi R, Palmer JR, Hartge P, Hyer M, Kaufman R, Adam E, Strohsnitter W, Noller K, Pickett KE, Hoover R. | title = Psychosexual characteristics of men and women exposed prenatally to diethylstilbestrol | journal = Epidemiology | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 155–160 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12606880 | doi=10.1097/01.EDE.0000039059.38824.B2}}</ref>

Various neurological changes occur after prenatal exposure of embryonic males to DES and other estrogenic endocrine disrupters. Animals that exhibited these structural neurological changes were also shown to demonstrate various gender-related behavioral changes (so called "feminization of males"). Several published studies in the medical literature on psychoneuroendocrinology have examined the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to estrogens (including DES) may cause significant developmental impact on sexual differentiation of the brain, and on subsequent behavioral and gender identity development in exposed males and females.<ref name="pmid1961841">{{cite journal | author = Reinisch JM, Ziemba-Davis M, Sanders SA | title = Hormonal contributions to sexually dimorphic behavioral development in humans | journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume = 16 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 213–78 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1961841 | doi = 10.1016/0306-4530(91)90080-D}}</ref><ref name="pmid4734959">{{cite journal | author = Yalom ID, Green R, Fisk N | title = Prenatal exposure to female hormones.

===Psychological anomalies===

Most of the initial research documenting the psychological effects of prenatal DES exposure was poorly conducted, often by mail card. Despite that, some more carefully conducted studies show a clear link to depression<ref name="pmid8310108">{{cite journal | author = Pillard RC, Rosen LR, Meyer-Bahlburg H, Weinrich JD, Feldman JF, Gruen R, Ehrhardt AA | title = Psychopathology and social functioning in men prenatally exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) | journal = Psychosom Med | volume = 55 | issue = 6 | pages = 485–91 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8310108 }}</ref> and lower visual-spatial reasoning skills.<ref name="pmid1563729">{{cite journal | author = Reinisch JM, Sanders SA | title = Effects of prenatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) on hemispheric laterality and spatial ability in human males | journal = Horm Behav | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 62–75 | year = 1992| pmid = 1563729 | doi = 10.1016/0018-506X(92)90032-Q}}</ref> However, as noted above, this was not seen in a large, well-conducted US study involving a comparison of DES-exposed and unexposed individuals, in which DES exposure (or lack thereof) was confirmed by the medical record.  <ref name="PMID12606880">{{cite journal | author = Titus-Ernstoff L, Perez K, Hatch EE, Troisi R, Palmer JR, Hartge P, Hyer M, Kaufman R, Adam E, Strohsnitter W, Noller K, Pickett KE, Hoover R. | title = Psychosexual characteristics of men and women exposed prenatally to diethylstilbestrol | journal = Epidemiology | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 155–160 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12606880 | doi=10.1097/01.EDE.0000039059.38824.B2}}</ref>

What has become more clear in recent years is the psychological disturbances caused by excessive prenatal estrogen exposure (regardless of source) as measured by the [[digit ratio]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Excessive ''in utero'' estrogen exposure may have an impact on hemispheric brain specialization, and hinder connections to the [[prefrontal cortex]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Prenatal Testosteron makes a Genius?|url=http://www.sciencentechnologyupdates.com/2011/03/extra-prenatal-testosterone-makes.html|date=2011-03-13|newspaper=The World of Science and Technology}}</ref> While exposure to DES might not specifically cause them, it may exacerbate a predisposition in individuals susceptible to [[schizophrenia]],<ref name="pmid14687873">{{cite journal | author = Arató M, Frecska E, Beck C, An M, Kiss H | title = Digit length pattern in schizophrenia suggests disturbed prenatal hemispheric lateralization | journal = Prog.

Lastly, using DES as an "environmental estrogen", a 2009 animal study determined prenatal exposure disrupts specialized brain cells and their ability to regulate brain chemistry, specifically altering the way cells release and reabsorb [[dopamine]], an important chemical messenger that governs movement and pleasure.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hessler MD,  Laiosa W | title = Estrogen mimics at low doses change how brain cells manage dopamine|journal=Environmental Health News | url = http://www.environmentalhealthnews.org/ehs/newscience/low-level-EEs-alter-dopamine-from-brain-cells | date =2009-03-03}}</ref><ref name="pmid19479021">{{cite journal | author = Alyea RA, Watson CS | title = Differential regulation of dopamine transporter function and location by low concentrations of environmental estrogens and 17beta-estradiol | journal = Environ.

Research into the links between excessive prenatal estrogen exposure, gender identity and resultant psychiatric conditions continues, and professional opinions remain divided at this time.<ref name=rudacille>{{cite book | author = Rudacille D | year = 2005 | title = The Riddle of Gender: Science, Activism, and Transgender Rights | location = New York | publisher = Pantheon Books | isbn = 0-375-42162-9 }}</ref><ref name="pmid19851856">{{cite journal | author = Meyer-Bahlburg HF | title = From mental disorder to iatrogenic hypogonadism: dilemmas in conceptualizing gender identity variants as psychiatric conditions | journal = Arch Sex Behav | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 461–76 | year = 2010 | pmid = 19851856 | pmc = 2844928 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-009-9532-4 }}</ref>

=== Lawsuits ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
In the 1970s, the negative publicity surrounding the discovery of DES's long-term effects resulted in a huge wave of lawsuits in the United States against its manufacturers. These culminated in a landmark 1980 decision of the [[Supreme Court of California]], ''[[Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories]]'', in which the court imposed a [[rebuttable presumption]] of [[market share liability]] upon all DES manufacturers, proportional to their share of the market at the time the drug was consumed by the mother of a particular plaintiff. 

Currently underway in Boston Federal Court is litigation filed by 53 DES daughters who say their breast cancers were the result of DES being prescribed to their mothers while pregnant with them. Their cases survived a [[Daubert]] hearing.  Settlement negotiations between the plaintiffs and defendants were unsuccessful in 2012. The cases will go to trial in 2013.

Researchers are still following the health of persons exposed to DES to determine whether other health problems occur as they grow older.

===Third generation===

Current research also looks at DES in the third generation. These are the children of men and women who were exposed to DES ''in utero''; thus, they are also the grandchildren of women who were given DES during pregnancy. Studies of the third generation are important because DES might be associated with [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] changes, which involve changes to the way genes behave (not involving the DNA itself) that may be heritable from one generation to another. If epigenetic changes occur and are heritable, studies of the DES-exposed third generation have implications for the influence of environmental endocrine disruptors on human health and evolution.

Recent results from the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) multicenter study of DES show the daughters of DES prenatally exposed women may be less likely than the unexposed to have regular menstrual periods. A possible increased risk of infertility in the older, third generation daughters was also noted. The NCI study provides limited evidence of an increased risk of birth defects in the sons or daughters of women who were exposed prenatally to DES. An increased risk of ovarian cancer in the daughters of prenatally exposed women was seen, but it was based on three cases, so the finding is considered preliminary and requires confirmation.

Some evidence suggests the sons of prenatally DES-exposed women might have an increased risk of [[hypospadias]],<ref name="lancet">{{cite journal | author = Klip H, Verloop J, van Gool JD, Koster ME, Burger CW, van Leeuwen FE | title = Hypospadias in sons of women exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero: a cohort study | journal = Lancet | volume = 359 | issue = 9312 | pages = 1102–7 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11943257 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08152-7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Kalfa, N., Paris, F,, Soyer-Gobillard, M., Daures, J., and Sultan, C.  | title = Prevalence of hypospadias in grandsons of women exposed to diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy: a multigenerational national cohort study | journal = Fertility & Sterility | volume = 95 | pages = 2574–2577 | year = 2011 }}</ref> but other studies suggest the increase in risk might not be as great as once thought.<ref name="repro">{{cite journal | author = Brouwers MM, Feitz WF, Roelofs LA, Kiemeney LA, de Gier RP, Roeleveld N | title = Hypospadias: a transgenerational effect of diethylstilbestrol? | journal = Hum.

== DES for canines ==
DES has been very successful in treating female canine incontinence stemming from poor sphincter control. It is still available from compounding pharmacies, and at the low (1&nbsp;mg) dose, does not have the carcinogenic properties that were so problematic in humans.<ref>{{cite web|title=Urinary Incontinence|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/191024.htm|work=Merck Veterinary Manual|publisher=[[Merck Veterinary Manual]]|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>  It is generally administered once a day for seven to ten days and then once every week as needed.

== DES in food production ==

During the 1960s, DES was used as a growth hormone in the beef and poultry industries. It was later found to cause cancer and was "phased out in the late 1970s".<ref name="urlenvirocancer.cornell.edu">{{cite web | url = http://envirocancer.cornell.edu/factsheet/diet/fs37.hormones.cfm | title = Consumer Concerns About Hormones in Food | author = Gandhi R, Snedeker S | date = 2000-06-01 | work = Fact Sheet #37, June 2000 | publisher = Program on Breast Cancer and Environmental Risk Factors, Cornell University | accessdate = 2011-07-20 }}</ref> When DES was discovered to be harmful to humans, it was moved to veterinarian use.
