'''[[Chronic fatigue syndrome]]''' ('''CFS''') is the name currently used by the majority of the medical and scientific community to describe a condition or set of conditions characterized by [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and other symptoms. The term is contested, mostly by patients and patient advocacy groups, but also by some doctors. Several of the more common alternative names used to describe what most believe to be the same condition or subtypes include '''myalgic encephalomyelitis''' (ME), '''chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome''' (CFIDS),''' and [[post-viral fatigue syndrome]]''' (PVFS).<ref name="isbn_9780199233168">{{cite book |author=Sharpe, Michael; Frankie Campling |title=Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS/ME) |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2008 |pages=7–8 |isbn=0-19-923316-0 |oclc= |doi= |url=http://www.amazon.com/reader/0199233160?_encoding=UTF8&ref_=sib%5Fdp%5Fpt#reader_0199233160 |accessdate=2009-10-23}}</ref>

In 1959, [[Donald Acheson|E.D. Acheson]] an early investigator of benign myalgic encephalomyelitis, wrote: "The wisdom of naming a disorder, the nature of which cannot at present be proved, and which may be due to more than one agent, is debatable."<ref name=ach/> The name used to label the condition (or set of conditions) is one of several [[Controversies related to chronic fatigue syndrome|controversies]] related to CFS.

==Current nomenclatures==

===Myalgic encephalomyelitis===
''Myalgic encephalomyelitis'' (ME) means "inflammation of the brain and spinal cord with muscle pain."  ME is used in the current ICD10 classification system of the World Health Organization as a subheading under Brain Disorders - [[post-viral fatigue syndrome]]. A review from 2001 noted a report that indicates ME is a distinct condition from CFS, but CFS and ME are usually used as synonyms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Whiting P, Bagnall AM, Sowden AJ, Cornell JE, Mulrow CD, Ramírez G |title=Interventions for the treatment and management of chronic fatigue syndrome: a systematic review |journal=JAMA |volume=286 |issue=11 |pages=1360–8 |year=2001 |month=September |pmid=11560542 |doi= 10.1001/jama.286.11.1360|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11560542}}</ref>

Many patients, and some doctors, especially in the United Kingdom, prefer to use ME on its own or in conjunction with CFS (ME/CFS or CFS/ME) because they believe it implies a more serious illness than the term ''chronic fatigue syndrome'' which focuses simply on fatigue.<ref name="pmid_12448589"/> Margaret Williams, writing for the British chairty MEactionUK, stated that the term "ME/CFS" was preferred because it more directly addressed a specific medical condition, while CFS/ME implied and placed emphasis on a condition of general fatigue.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.meactionuk.org.uk/ME_CFS_TERMINOLOGY.htm | title = ME/CFS Terminology | last = Williams | first = M | publisher = ME Action UK | accessdate = 2010-06-25 | date = 2009-04-27 }}</ref>  Some patient groups prefer the name ''myalgic encephalopathy'' as a synonym as this does not imply inflammation but simply an illness of the nervous system. The name myalgic encephalopathy has also been evaluated as being perceived as a more serious sounding illness than chronic fatigue syndrome by research outside of the UK.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jason LA, Taylor RR, Plioplys S, Stepanek Z, Shlaes J |title=Evaluating attributions for an illness based upon the name: chronic fatigue syndrome, myalgic encephalopathy and Florence Nightingale disease |journal=Am J Community Psychol |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=133–48 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11928774 |doi= 10.1023/A:1014328319297|url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0091-0562&volume=30&page=133}}</ref>

The first appearance of the term ME was in a 1956 ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'' editorial by [[Donald Acheson]].<ref name=Acheson1956>{{cite journal |author=Acheson D | authorlink = Donald Acheson |title=A new clinical entity? |journal=Lancet |volume=270 |issue=6926 |pages=789–90 |year=1956 |pmid=13320887 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(56)91252-1 }}</ref>  Three years later, Acheson referred to several older reports and many different names that appeared to describe a similar syndrome, noting that the inflammation is presumed. Acheson also cites criticisms of the correctness of the name used in 1959, "benign myalgic encephalomyelitis", as the disease was not always benign, does not always cause muscle pain, and may not cause inflammation of the [[central nervous system]].<ref name="ach">{{cite journal | author = Acheson E | title = The clinical syndrome variously called benign myalgic encephalomyelitis, Iceland disease and epidemic neuromyasthenia. | journal = Am J Med | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 569–95 | year = 1959 | pmid = 13637100 | url=http://www.meresearch.org.uk/information/keypubs/Acheson_AmJMed.pdf |format=PDF| doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(59)90280-3}}</ref>  In 1962 [[Russell Brain, 1st Baron Brain|Russell Brain]] included ME in his textbook of neurology.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Brain R |authorlink= |title=Diseases of the Nervous System |edition=6 |year=1962}}</ref>  In 1978, the ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' reported that researchers at a [[Royal Society of Medicine]] conference to discuss the illness during that year clearly agreed that the symptoms described as myalgic encephalomyelitis made up a distinct [[Nosology|nosological]] entity.

In 2011, an "international consensus criteria" for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis was published by a group of 26 individuals from 13 countries and consisting of clinicians, researchers, teaching faculty and an independent patient advocate. The authors rejected the name "chronic fatigue syndrome", re-asserted "myalgic encephalomyelitis" as the appropriate name and WHO classification based on "research and clinical experience that strongly point to widespread inflammation and multisystemic neuropathology", and criticized the primary emphasis on "fatigue" which is no longer a requirement. On the issue of ME vs CFS, the authors state that patients meeting this new criteria "should be removed from" the Reeves et al.

==Historical nomenclatures==
===Chronic Epstein-Barr virus ===
Also known as ''Chronic Mononucleosis'', the term CEBV was introduced in 1985<ref name="pmid2578268">{{cite journal | author = Straus S, Tosato G, Armstrong G, Lawley T, Preble O, Henle W, Davey R, Pearson G, Epstein J, Brus I | title = Persisting illness and fatigue in adults with evidence of Epstein-Barr virus infection | journal = Ann Intern Med | volume = 102 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–16 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2578268}}</ref><ref name="pmid2578266">{{cite journal | author = Jones J, Ray C, Minnich L, Hicks M, Kibler R, Lucas D | title = Evidence for active Epstein-Barr virus infection in patients with persistent, unexplained illnesses: elevated anti-early antigen antibodies | journal = Ann Intern Med | volume = 102 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–7 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2578266}}</ref> in the United States. The [[Epstein-Barr virus]], a neurotropic virus that more commonly causes [[infectious mononucleosis]], was thought to be the cause of CFS. Subsequent discovery of the closely related ''[[HHV-6|human herpesvirus 6]]'' shifted the direction of biomedical studies, although a vastly expanded and substantial body of published research continues to show active viral infection or reinfection of CFS patients by these two viruses. These viruses are also found in healthy controls, lying dormant.
