There are two effective rotavirus vaccines: Rotarix by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] and RotaTeq by [[Merck & Co., Inc.|Merck]].<ref name="CD008521">{{cite journal |author=Soares-Weiser K, Maclehose H, Bergman H, ''et al.'' |title=Vaccines for preventing rotavirus diarrhoea: vaccines in use |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=11 |issue= |pages=CD008521 |year=2012 |pmid=23152260 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008521.pub3}}</ref>

On June 5, 2009, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommended that rotavirus vaccine be included in all national immunization programs. The ''Rotavirus Vaccine Program'' and the Accelerated Vaccine Introduction initiative have worked to study rotavirus vaccines among developing-country populations to assist developing countries in introducing rotavirus vaccines into routine immunization programs. These partnerships are spearheaded by international non-governmental organization PATH, WHO, the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], and the [[Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization]].<ref>[http://www.rotavirus.org/ PATH's Rotavirus Vaccine Program]</ref>

== History ==
In 1998, a rotavirus vaccine (RotaShield, by [[Wyeth]]) was licensed for use in the [[United States]]. Clinical trials in the United States, [[Finland]], and [[Venezuela]] had found it to be 80 to 100% effective at preventing severe diarrhea caused by rotavirus A, and researchers had detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects. The manufacturer of the vaccine, however, withdrew it from the market in 1999, after it was discovered that the vaccine may have contributed to an increased risk for [[Intussusception (medical disorder)|intussusception]], or bowel obstruction, in one of every 12,000 vaccinated infants. The experience provoked debate about the relative risks and benefits of a rotavirus vaccine.<ref name="pmid16099078">{{cite journal |author=Bines J |title=Intussusception and rotavirus vaccines |journal=Vaccine |volume=24 |issue=18 |pages=3772–6 |year=2006 |pmid=16099078 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2005.07.031}}</ref>

In 2006, two vaccines against Rotavirus A infection were shown to be safe and effective in children: Rotarix by [[GlaxoSmithKline]]<ref name="pmid17280473">{{cite journal |author=O'Ryan M |title=Rotarix (RIX4414): an oral human rotavirus vaccine |journal=Expert review of vaccines |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=11–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17280473 |doi=10.1586/14760584.6.1.11}}</ref> and RotaTeq by [[Merck & Co., Inc.|Merck]].<ref name="pmid17055370">{{cite journal |author=Matson DO |title=The pentavalent rotavirus vaccine, RotaTeq |journal=Seminars in paediatric infectious diseases |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=195–9 |year=2006 |pmid=17055370 |doi=10.1053/j.spid.2006.08.005}}</ref> Both are taken orally and contain disabled live virus.

== Rotarix ==
Rotarix is a human, live attenuated rotavirus vaccine containing a rotavirus strain of G1P[8] specificity.
ROTARIX is indicated for the prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by G1 and non-G1 types (G3, G4, and G9) when administered as a 2-dose series in infants and children.<ref name="pmid17280473">{{cite journal

In March 2010 FDA officials urged pediatricians to temporarily stop using GlaxoSmithKline's Rotarix because they found it contaminated with fragments of DNA from [[porcine circovirus]]-1. Although this contamination was thought to be benign, vaccines are supposed to be sterile. In May 2010 the suspension of the vaccine was lifted. <ref>FDA's MedWatch Safety Alerts: May 2010 [http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm213978.htm#Rotarix%20Vaccine%20Suspension%20Lifted Rotarix Vaccine Suspension Lifted] </ref>

== RotaTeq ==
[[File:Clark-Offit-rotavirus-inventors.jpeg|thumb|H. Fred Clark and [[Paul Offit]], the inventors of RotaTeq.]]

RotaTeq is a live, oral pentavalent vaccine that contains five rotaviruses produced by [[reassortment]]. The rotavirus A parent strains of the reassortants were isolated from human and bovine hosts. Four reassortant rotaviruses express one of the outer capsid, VP7, proteins (serotypes G1, G2, G3, or G4) from the human rotavirus parent strain and the attachment protein VP4 (type P7) from the bovine rotavirus parent strain. The fifth reassortant virus expresses the attachment protein VP4, (type P1A), from the human rotavirus parent strain and the outer capsid protein VP7 (serotype G6) from the bovine rotavirus parent strain. In February 2006, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] approved RotaTeq for use in the United States. In August 2006, [[Health Canada]] approved RotaTeq for use in Canada.<ref>{{cite press release|url= http://www.merckfrosst.ca/assets/en/pdf/press/product_info/rotateq/press_releases/Release_NATIONAL_CNW.pdf|title=RotaTeq Is Approved In Canada|publisher=Merck Frosst Canada|date=2006-08-23|accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref> Merck is working with a range of partners including governmental and non-governmental organisations to develop and implement mechanisms for providing access to this vaccine in the developing world.<ref name="pmid12598149">{{cite journal |author=McCarthy M |title=Project seeks to "fast track" rotavirus vaccine |journal=Lancet |volume=361 |issue=9357 |pages=582 |year=2003 |pmid=12598149 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12549-4}}</ref>

===Temporary suspension===

On March 22, 2010, the detection of DNA from [[porcine circovirus]] types 1 and 2 within RotaTeq prompted the FDA to suspend the use of rotavirus vaccines while conducting an investigation in collaboration with the 12 members of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC).<ref name=ucm212140>{{cite web|last=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|title=Update on Recommendations for the Use of Rotavirus Vaccines|url=http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm212140.htm|accessdate=13 July 2012}}</ref> On May 6, 2010, the FDA announced its decision to revoke the suspension, asserting that porcine circovirus types 1 and 2 pose no safety risks in humans and concluded that health risks involved did not offset the benefits of the vaccination.<ref name=ucm212140/>

== Effectiveness and cost ==

A 2009 review estimated that vaccination against rotavirus would prevent about 45% of deaths due to rotavirus gastroenteritis, or about 228,000 deaths annually worldwide. At $5 per dose the estimated cost per life saved was $3,015, $9,951 and $11,296 in low-, lower-middle-, and upper-middle-income countries, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rheingans RD, Antil L, Dreibelbis R, Podewils LJ, Bresee JS, Parashar UD |title=Economic costs of rotavirus gastroenteritis and cost-effectiveness of vaccination in developing countries |journal=J Infect Dis |volume=200 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S16–27 |year=2009 |pmid=19817595 |doi=10.1086/605026 }}</ref> The cost of rotavirus vaccination has fallen by 67 percent between 2006 and 2011 to USD 2.50 per dose,<ref>{{cite web|last=Berkley|first=Seth|title=Beating the Child Killers|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/taking-the-fight-to-pneumonia-and-diarrhea-by-seth-berkley-1d35dc0146f86f3c1282a404|publisher=Project Syndicate|accessdate=17 April 2013|date=12 April 2013}}</ref> as part of an offer made by a  pharmaceutical company to the [[GAVI Alliance]].
