'''Thyroid peroxidase''' or '''thyroperoxidase''' (TPO) is an [[enzyme]] expressed mainly in the [[thyroid]] that liberates [[iodine]] for addition onto [[tyrosine]] residues on [[thyroglobulin]] for the production of [[thyroxine]] (T<sub>4</sub>) or [[triiodothyronine]] (T<sub>3</sub>), [[thyroid hormones]].<ref name="pmid16098474">{{cite journal | author = Ruf J, Carayon P | title = Structural and functional aspects of thyroid peroxidase | journal = Arch.

== Catalyzed reaction ==

2[[File:L-Tyrosin_phys.svg|150px|L-Tyrosin]] + 2 I<sup>−</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> ⇒ 2[[File:3-Iod-L-Tyrosin.svg|150px|3-Iod-L-Tyrosin]] + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O

Iodide is oxidized to iodine radical which immediately reacts with tyrosine.

2[[File:3-Iod-L-Tyrosin.svg|150px|3-Iod-L-Tyrosin]] + 2 I<sup>−</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> ⇒ 2[[File:3,5-Diiod-L-Tyrosin.svg|150px|3,5-Diiod-L-Tyrosin]] + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O

The second iodine atom is added in similar manner to the reaction intermediate 3-iodotyrosine.

Inorganic iodine enters the body primarily as iodide, I<sup>-</sup>. After entering the [[thyroid follicle]] (or thyroid follicular cell) via a Na<sup>+</sup>/I<sup>-</sup> symporter (NIS) on the basolateral side, iodide is shuttled across the apical membrane into the colloid via [[pendrin]], after which thyroid peroxidase [[oxidize]]s iodide to atomic iodine (I) or iodinium (I<sup>+</sup>). The "organification of iodine," the incorporation of iodine into [[thyroglobulin]] for the production of thyroid hormone, is nonspecific; that is, there is no TPO-bound intermediate, but iodination occurs via reactive iodine species released from TPO.<ref name="pmid18631006">{{cite journal | author = Kessler J, Obinger C, Eales G | title = Factors influencing the study of peroxidase-generated iodine species and implications for thyroglobulin synthesis | journal = Thyroid | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 769–74 | year = 2008 | month = July | pmid = 18631006 | doi = 10.1089/thy.2007.0310 }}</ref> The chemical reactions catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase occur on the outer apical membrane surface and are mediated by hydrogen peroxide.

==Stimulation and inhibition==

TPO is stimulated by [[thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]], which upregulates gene expression.

TPO is inhibited by the [[thioamide]] drugs, such as [[propylthiouracil]] and [[methimazole]].<ref name="pmid947933">{{cite journal | author = Nagasaka A, Hidaka H | title = Effect of antithyroid agents 6-propyl-2-thiouracil and 1-methyl-2-mercaptoimidazole on human thyroid iodine peroxidase | journal = J.

==Clinical significance==   
Thyroid peroxidase is a frequent [[epitope]] of [[autoantibody|autoantibodies]] in autoimmune thyroid disease, with such antibodies being called [[anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies]] (anti-TPO antibodies). This is most commonly associated with [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]]. Thus, an [[antibody titer]] can be used to assess disease activity in patients that have developed such antibodies.<ref name="pmid11129117">{{cite journal | author = McLachlan SM, Rapoport B | title = Autoimmune response to the thyroid in humans: thyroid peroxidase--the common autoantigenic denominator | journal = Int.
