'''Rape''' is a type of [[sexual assault]] usually involving [[sexual intercourse]], which is initiated by one or more persons against another person without that person's [[consent]]. The act may be carried out by physical force, [[coercion]], abuse of authority or with a person who is incapable of valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, or below the legal [[age of consent]].<ref name="merriam-webster.com">{{cite web|title=Rape|publisher=''[[Merriam-Webster]]''|date=April 15, 2011|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rape%5B3%5D}}</ref><ref name="who.int">{{cite web|title=Sexual violence chapter 6|publisher=''[[World Health Organization]]''|date=April 15, 2011|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2002/9241545615_chap6_eng.pdf

When part of a widespread and systematic practice, rape and [[sexual slavery]] are recognized as [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crime]]s. Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of [[genocide]] when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted ethnic group.

Victims of rape can be severely [[Psychological trauma|traumatized]] and may suffer from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]];<ref name="aaets">{{cite web|url=http://www.aaets.org/article178.htm |title=Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in Rape Survivors |publisher=The American Academy of Experts in Traumatic Stress |year=1995 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref> in addition to psychological harm resulting from the act, rape may cause physical injury, or have additional effects on the victim, such as acquiring of a [[sexually transmitted infection]] or becoming [[pregnant]].

==Definitions==

===Penetrative and non-penetrative===
{{See also|Laws regarding rape}}
The definition of rape varies both in different parts of the world and at different times in history.<ref name=Book04/> It is defined in many jurisdictions as [[sexual intercourse]], or other forms of [[sexual penetration]], of one person by another person without the [[consent]] of the victim.<ref name=Book04>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=ed. by Merril D.|title=Encyclopedia of rape|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn. [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-313-32687-5|pages=169–170|edition=1. publ.}}</ref> The [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] defines it as "sexual intercourse without valid consent,"<ref name="unodc1"/><ref>[http://w3.unece.org/pxweb/Dialog/Footnote.asp?File=ZZZ_GECr_Convictions_r.px&path=../DATABASE/Stat/30-GE/07-CV/&ti=Convictions+by+Type+of+Conviction+%2C+Sex%2C+Country+and+Year&lang=1&ansi=1&noofvar=4 Convictions by Type of Conviction, Sex, Country and Year]. Database of United Nations Economic Commission for Europe</ref> and the [[World Health Organization]] defined it in 2002 as "physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration&nbsp;– even if slight&nbsp;– of the vulva or anus, using a penis, other body parts or an object".<ref>{{cite book|last=Krug|title=Rapport mondial sur la violence et la santé|year=2002|publisher=Organisation mondiale de la santé|location=Genève|isbn=92-4-154561-5|page=149|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/full_en.pdf}}</ref> 

In 2012, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] changed their definition from "The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will." to "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or [[Oral sex|oral penetration]] by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." for their annual [[Uniform Crime Reports]]. The definition, which had remained unchanged since 1927, was considered outdated and narrow. The updated definition includes any gender of victim and perpetrator, not just women being raped by men, recognizes that rape with an object can be as traumatic as penile/vaginal rape, includes instances in which the victim is unable to give consent because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity, and recognizes that a victim can be incapacitated and thus unable to consent because of ingestion of drugs or alcohol. However, the definition does not change federal or state criminal codes or impact charging and prosecution on the federal, state or local level; it rather means that rape will be more accurately reported nationwide.<ref>[http://blogs.usdoj.gov/blog/archives/1801 An Updated Definition of Rape (U.S. Dept of Justice, January 6, 2012)]</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/us/politics/federal-crime-statistics-to-expand-rape-definition.html U.S. to Expand Rape Definition in Crime Statistics (New York Times, January 6, 2012)]</ref> 

Some countries, such as Germany, are now using more inclusive definitions which do not require penetration,<ref name=Book04/> and the 1998 [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] defines it as "a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive".<ref name=Book04/> In some jurisdictions, the term "rape" has been phased out of legal use in favor of terms such as "[[sexual assault]]" or "criminal sexual conduct".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msu.edu/~sdclub/resources/criminal%20code.doc |title=Criminal code |accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref> Other countries or jurisdictions continue to define rape to cover only acts involving penile penetration of the vagina, treating all other types of non-consensual sexual activity as sexual assault. Scotland, for instance, requires that a rapist commit a sexual assault with a penis, so only males can legally be rapists.

===Consent===
In any allegation of rape, the absence of consent to sexual intercourse on the part of the victim is critical.<ref name=thefreedictionary.com/> Consent need not be expressed, and may be implied from the context and from the relationship of the parties, but the absence of objection does not of itself constitute consent. Lack of consent may result from either forcible compulsion by the perpetrator or an incapacity to consent on the part of the victim (such as persons who are asleep, intoxicated or otherwise mentally helpless).<ref name=thefreedictionary.com/><ref name="amnesty.org">[http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/IOR53/001/2011/en/7f5eae8f-c008-4caf-ab59-0f84605b61e0/ior530012011en.pdf Rape and sexual violence: Human rights law and standards in the International Criminal Court]. Amnesty International 2011</ref> The law can also invalidate consent in the case of sexual intercourse with a person below the age at which they can legally consent to such relations with older persons. (See [[age of consent]].) Such cases are sometimes called [[statutory rape]] or "unlawful sexual intercourse", regardless of whether it was [[informed consent|consensual]] or not, as people who are under a certain age in relation to the perpetrator are deemed legally incapable of consenting to sex.<ref name=thefreedictionary.com/> Consent can always be withdrawn at any time, so that any further sexual activity after the withdrawal of consent constitutes rape.

[[Duress]], in which the victim may be subject to or threatened by overwhelming force or violence, and which may result in absence of objection to intercourse, leads to the presumption of lack of consent.<ref name="amnesty.org"/> Duress may be actual or threatened force or violence against the victim or somebody else close to the victim. Even [[blackmail]] may constitute duress. [[Abuse of power]] may constitute duress. For instance, in Philippines, a man commits rape if he engages in sexual intercourse with a woman ''"By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority"''.<ref>[http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno8353.htm REPUBLIC ACT NO. 8353]. Philippine Law. Approved: September 30, 1997</ref> The [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] in its landmark 1998 judgment used a definition of rape which did not use the word 'consent': "a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person ''under circumstances which are coercive''."<ref>[http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/annualreports/a54/9925571e.htm Fourth Annual Report of ICTR to the General Assembly (1999)] March 23, 2007</ref>

[[Marital rape]], also known as spousal rape, is non-consensual sex in which the perpetrator is the victim's spouse. As such, it is a form of [[Sexual violence by intimate partners|partner rape]], of [[domestic violence]], and of sexual abuse. Historically, and still in some countries, consent was assumed within the marriage contract, thus making spousal rape an impossibility; however, spousal rape is now repudiated by international conventions and increasingly criminalized. In 2006, it was estimated that marital rape could be prosecuted in at least 104 countries (in four of these countries, marital rape could be prosecuted only when the spouses were judicially separated),<ref>[http://www.cities-localgovernments.org/uclg/upload/docs/notaminutemore-endingviolenceagainstwomen.pdf UNIFEM bookfinalrearranged]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-10-01.</ref> and since 2006 several other countries have outlawed spousal rape. In the US, spousal rape is illegal in all 50 states; the first state to outlaw it was [[South Dakota]] in 1975,<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/13/us/marital-rape-drive-for-tougher-laws-is-pressed.html Marital rape: Drive for tougher laws is pressed], 13 May 1987</ref> and the last [[North Carolina]] in 1993.<ref>[http://www.ncvc.org/ncvc/main.aspx?dbName=DocumentViewer&DocumentID=32701 The National Center for Victims of Crime – Library/Document Viewer]. Ncvc.org. Retrieved on 2011-10-01.</ref> Other [[developing countries]] outlawed it in the 2000s. In many countries, it is not clear if marital rape may or may not be prosecuted under ordinary rape laws. However, in the absence of a spousal rape law it may be possible to bring prosecutions for what is effectively rape by characterizing it as an assault.

Some [[Feminist views on prostitution|feminists view prostitution]], with or without consent, as rape. [[Trisha Baptie]], a former [[Canadian]] prostitute, who now opposes the industry, and lobbies for the outlawing of buying sexual services, wrote: "Harm reduction? You can’t make prostitution "safer"; prostitution is violence in itself. It is rape, the money only appeases men’s guilt."<ref>{{cite web|author=Trisha Baptie |url=http://sisyphe.org/spip.php?article3290|title="Sex worker" ? Never met one ! |publisher=Sisyphe.org |date=2009-04-26 |accessdate=2010-05-09}}</ref>

===Types===
{{Main|Types of rape}}
{{See also|Rape by gender}}
There are several types of rape, generally categorized by reference to the situation in which it occurs, the sex or characteristics of the victim, and/or the sex or characteristics of the perpetrator. Different types of rape include [[date rape]], [[gang rape]], [[marital rape]], [[incest|incestual rape]], [[child sexual abuse]], [[prison rape]], acquaintance rape, [[war rape]] and [[statutory rape]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/rape |title=UCSB's SexInfo |publisher=Soc.ucsb.edu |accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref>

==Motivation of perpetrators==
{{further|Causes of sexual violence}}
There is no single theory that conclusively explains the motivation for rape; the motives of rapists can be multi-factorial and are subject to debate. Several factors have been proposed: [[anger]], a desire for [[power (philosophy)|power]], [[Sadomasochism|sadism]], as well as sexual gratification and [[Sociobiological theories of rape|evolutionary pressures]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thornhill|first1= Randy |last2= Palmer|first2= Craig T|title=A Natural History of Rape: Biological Bases of Sexual Coercion |publisher= The MIT Press|year= 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature | publisher=Penguin | last=Pinker|first= Steven | year=2003 | isbn=978-1-101-20032-2|chapter=Chapter 19}}</ref>

==Sustaining factors==
The World Health Organization states that the principal factors that lead to the perpetration of sexual violence are:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/ |title=WHO &#124; Violence against women |publisher=World Health Organisation |date=2012-11-23 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref>

*beliefs in family honour and sexual purity;
*ideologies of male sexual entitlement; 
*weak legal sanctions for sexual violence.

==Effects==

===General===
{{see also|Effects and aftermath of rape|Pregnancy from rape}}
Victims of rape can be severely [[Psychological trauma|traumatized]] by the assault and may have difficulty functioning as well as they had been used to prior to the assault, with disruption of concentration, sleeping patterns and eating habits, for example. They may feel jumpy or be on edge. After being raped, it is common for the victim to experience [[Acute stress reaction|acute stress disorder]], including symptoms similar to those of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], such as intense, sometimes unpredictable emotions, and they may find it hard to deal with their memories of the event.<ref name="AJP"/><ref name="PTASD"/> In the months immediately following the assault, these problems may be severe and upsetting and may prevent the victim from revealing their ordeal to [[friend]]s or [[family]], or seeking police or medical assistance. Additional symptoms of Acute Stress Disorder include:<ref name=PTASD/>
*[[Depersonalization]] or [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] (feeling numb and detached, like being in a daze or a dream, or feeling that the world is strange and unreal)
*Difficulty remembering important parts of the assault
*Reliving the assault through repeated thoughts, memories, or nightmares
*Avoidance of things, places, thoughts, and/or feelings that remind the victim of the assault
*Anxiety or increased alertness (difficulty sleeping, concentrating, etc.)
*Avoidance of social life or place of rape

For one-third to one-half of the victims, these symptoms continue beyond the first few months and meet the conditions for the diagnosis of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].<ref name=AJP/><ref name="psytimes"/><ref name="psydis"/>  In general, rape and sexual assault are among the most common causes of PTSD in women.<ref name=psytimes/>

[[Pregnancy from rape|Pregnancy]] can also result from rape.<ref name=CNN22-08-2012>Dellorto, Danielle (22 August 2012).

===HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa===
Rape may result in the transmission of [[HIV/AIDS]], and this is especially a problem in parts of the world where the disease is endemic, such as [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].

Rape acts both as a ''direct factor'', as the virus can be transmitted through the forced sexual intercourse, and as an ''indirect factor'', as victims of rape are at higher risk of suffering psychological problems, which may lead to victims being more likely to engage in behaviors that create risk of contracting HIV/AIDS, such as injecting drugs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.svri.org/hiv.htm |title=Sexual Violence and HIV |publisher=Sexual Violence Research Initiative |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref>

In many parts of Africa, the myth that sex with a virgin can cure HIV/AIDS continues to prevail, and, as such, many young girls are raped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceinafrica.co.za/2002/april/virgin.htm |title=HIV/AIDS, the stats, the Virgin Cure and infant rape |publisher=Science in Africa |date=2002-01-25 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2004/southafrica0304/4.htm |title=Deadly Delay: South Africa’s Efforts to Prevent HIV in Survivors of Sexual Violence: IV.

===Victim blaming===
{{Main|Victim blaming}}
"Victim blaming" is holding the victim of a crime to be in whole or in part responsible for the crime. In the context of rape, this concept refers to the [[just-world phenomenon|Just World Theory]] and popular attitudes that certain victim behaviours (such as flirting, or wearing sexually provocative clothing) may encourage rape.<ref>Pauwels, B. (2002). "Blaming the victim of rape: The culpable control model perspective." ''Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering,'' 63(5-B).</ref> In extreme cases, victims are said to have "asked for it", simply by not behaving demurely. In most Western countries, the defense of provocation is not accepted as a mitigation for rape.<ref>Abrahms, D., Viky, G., Masser, B., & Gerd, B. (2003). Perceptions of stranger and acquaintance rape: The role of benevolent and hostile sexism in victim blame and rape proclivity. Journal-of-Personality-and-Social-Psychology, 84(1), 111–125.,</ref> A global survey of attitudes toward sexual violence by the [[Global Forum for Health Research]] shows that victim-blaming concepts are at least partially accepted in many countries. In some countries{{which|date=August 2012}}, victim-blaming is more common, and women who have been raped are sometimes deemed to have behaved improperly. Often, these are countries where there is a significant social divide between the freedoms and status afforded to men and women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalforumhealth.org/filesupld/vaw/attitudes.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050205184952/http://www.globalforumhealth.org/filesupld/vaw/attitudes.html |archivedate=2005-02-05 |title=Attitudes to sexual violence |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2005-02-05 |accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref> Amy M. Buddie and Arthur G. Miller, in a review of studies of rape myths, state:

<blockquote>Rape victims are blamed more when they resist the attack later in the rape encounter rather than earlier (Kopper, 1996), which seems to suggest the stereotype that these women are engaging in token resistance (Malamuth & Brown, 1994; Muehlenhard & Rogers, 1998) or leading the man on because they have gone along with the sexual experience thus far. Finally, rape victims are blamed more when they are raped by an acquaintance or a date rather than by a stranger (e.g., Bell, Kuriloff, & Lottes, 1994; Bridges, 1991; Bridges & McGr ail, 1989; Check & Malamuth, 1983; Kanekar, Shaherwalla, Franco, Kunju, & Pinto, 1991; L'Armand & Pepitone, 1982; Tetreault & Barnett, 1987), which seems to evoke the stereotype that victims really want to have sex because they know their attacker and perhaps even went out on a date with him. The underlying message of this research seems to be that when certain stereotypical elements of rape are in place, rape victims are prone to being blamed.</blockquote>

However, they also state that "individuals may endorse rape myths and at the same time recognize the negative effects of rape."<ref>{{cite journal|author=Amy M. Buddie and Arthur G. Miller |title=Beyond Rape Myths: A more complex view of perceptions of rape victims|journal= Sex Roles: A Journal of Research|year= 2001|doi=10.1023/A:1013575209803|url=http://business.highbeam.com/435388/article-1G1-82782443/beyond-rape-myths-more-complex-view-perceptions-rape|volume=45|issue=3/4|page=139}} [http://www.taasa.org/library/pdfs/TAASALibrary22.pdf PDF copy]</ref> A number of [[gender role]] stereotypes can play a role in rationalization of rape. In the case of male-on-female rape, these include the idea that power is reserved to men whereas women are meant for sex and objectified, that women want forced sex and to be pushed around,<ref name="neumann">Neumann, S., Gang Rape: Examining Peer Support and Alcohol in Fraternities. Sex Crimes and Paraphilias</ref> and that male sexual impulses and behaviors are uncontrollable and must be satisfied.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Joan Z. Spade|author2=Catherine G.

It has been proposed by Dr. Roxanne Agnew-Davies, a clinical psychologist and an expert on the effects of sexual violence, that victim-blaming correlates with fear. "It is not surprising when so many rape victims blame themselves. Female jurors can look at the woman in the witness stand and decide she has done something 'wrong' such as flirting or having a drink with the defendant. She can therefore reassure herself that rape won't happen to her as long as she does nothing similar."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmainteractive.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=27312&Itemid=3158 |title=EMMA - Most Londoners Believe Rape Victims are to Blame |publisher=Emmainteractive.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-24}}</ref>

===Honor killings, violence against victims and forced marriages to the rapist===
In many cultures, victims of rape are at very high risk of suffering additional violence  or threats of violence after the rape. These acts may be perpetrated by the rapist or by friends and relatives of the rapist, as a way of preventing the victims from reporting the rape, of punishing them for reporting it, or of forcing them to withdraw the complaint; or they may be perpetrated by the relatives of the victim as a punishment for "bringing shame" to the family. This is especially the case in cultures where female [[virginity]] is highly valued and considered mandatory before marriage; in extreme cases, rape victims are killed in [[honor killings]].<ref name="zeenews.india" /><ref name="wisemuslimwomen" /><ref name="bbc" />

In some places, girls and women who are raped are often forced by their families to marry their rapist. Because being the victim of rape and losing virginity carry extreme social stigma, and the victims are deemed to have their "reputation" tarnished, a marriage with the rapist is arranged. This is claimed to be in the advantage of both the victim - who does not remain unmarried and doesn't lose social status - and of the rapist, who avoids punishment. In 2012, after a Moroccan 16-year-old girl committed [[suicide]] after having been forced by her family to marry her rapist, at the suggestion of the prosecutor, and having endured abuse by the rapist after they married, there have been protests from activists against the law which allows the rapist to marry the victim in order to escape criminal sanctions, and against this social practice which is common in Morocco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17379721 |title=BBC News - Morocco protest after raped Amina Filali kills herself |publisher=BBC News |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref>

==Prosecution==

===Reporting===
Sexual violence, and rape in particular, is considered the most under-reported violent crime (American Medical Association, 1995).<ref name="rds.homeoffice.gov.uk"/> Thus, the number of reported rapes is lower than both incidence and prevalence rates (Walby and Allen, 2004).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://broken-rainbow.org.uk/research/Dv%20crime%20survey.pdf |title=Domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking: Findings from the British Crime Survey |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref> The legal requirements for reporting rape vary by jurisdiction&nbsp;— each U.S. state may have different requirements<ref name="State Rape Reporting Requirements"/> while other countries may have less stringent limits.<ref name="New Zealand rape"/>

In [[Italy]], a 2006 National Statistic Institute survey on violence against women found that 91,6% of women who experienced rape did not report it to the police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=26309&baseHREF=country&baseHREFId=675 |title=The Secretary Generals database on violence against women |publisher=UN Secretary General's Database on Violence Against Women |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref>

===Investigation===
{{Main|Rape investigation}}
Since the vast majority of rapes are committed by persons known to the victim, the initiation and process of a rape investigation depends much on the victim's willingness and ability to report and describe a rape. [[Biological evidence]] such as [[semen]], [[blood]], [[vaginal secretions]], [[saliva]], and vaginal [[epithelial cell]]s (typically collected by a [[rape kit]]) may be identified and genetically typed by a [[crime lab]]. The information derived from the analysis can often help determine whether sexual contact occurred, provide information regarding the circumstances of the incident, and be compared to reference samples collected from patients and suspects.<ref name="ncjrs"/>

===Conviction===
In the United Kingdom, figures on reported rape cases show an ongoing decline in the conviction rate, putting it at an all time low of 5.6% in 2002. The government has expressed its concern at the year-on-year increase in attrition of reported rape cases, and pledged to address this "justice gap" (Home Office, 2002a).<ref name="rds.homeoffice.gov.uk"/> In 2003, a study by Rape Crisis Network Europe found that [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] had the lowest rate of conviction for rape (1%) among 21 European states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.ie/news/damning-indictment-ireland%E2%80%99s-attitude-women |title=A damning indictment of Ireland’s attitude to women &#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty INternational |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref>

==Prevention and treatment==
{{Main|Initiatives to prevent sexual violence}}
As sexual violence affects all parts of society, the response to sexual violence is comprehensive. The responses can be categorized as: individual approaches, health care responses, community-based efforts and actions to prevent other forms of sexual violence. Recovery from sexual assault is a complicated and controversial concept,<ref name="Recovering from sexual assault"/> but support groups, usually accessed by "umbrella" organizations (see [[List of anti-sexual assault organizations in the United States]]) are prevalent, including some on-line.

==Statistics==
{{Main|Rape statistics}}
{{See also|Estimates of sexual violence}}
A [[United Nations]] report compiled from government sources showed that more than 250,000 cases of rape or attempted rape were recorded by [[police]] annually. The reported data covered 65 countries.<ref>[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Eighth-United-Nations-Survey-on-Crime-Trends-and-the-Operations-of-Criminal-Justice-Systems.html The Eighth United Nations Survey on Crime Trends and the Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (2001–2002)] – Table 02.08 Total recorded rapes. unodc.org</ref>

In 2007, 40% of the 90,427 forcible rapes reported were cleared by arrest or "exceptional means."  Exceptional means refers to situations where the victim refuses to provide information or assistance necessary to obtain an arrest, the defendant dies before being arrested, or the defendant cannot be extradited from another state.<ref name="AAOJ">Bruce Gross [theforensicexaminer.com/archive/spring09/15/] False Rape Allegations: An Assault On Justice. The Forensic Examiner</ref>

Most rape research and reporting to date has been limited to male-female forms of rape. Research on [[Rape of males by males|male-male]] and [[Female-male rape|female-male]] rape is beginning to be done. According to psychologist Dr. Sarah Crome, fewer than one in ten male-male rapes are reported. As a group, male rape victims by either gender often get little services and support, and legal systems are often ill equipped to deal with this type of crime.<ref name=abc.net.au/> Denov (2004) states that societal responses to the issue of female perpetrators of sexual assault "point to a widespread denial of women as potential sexual aggressors that could work to obscure the true dimensions of the problem."<ref name="Denov"/> Due to these reasons, it is likely being substantially under-reported, with the probable cause being the double standard.<ref name="malesrapingfemales"/> Some legal codes on rape do not legislate against [[Female-male rape|women raping men]], as rape is generally defined to include the act of penetration on behalf of the rapist.<ref name=cdc.gov/> In 2007, the [[South Africa]] police investigated instances of women raping young men.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Sowetan|url=http://www.sowetan.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=413523|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070604164919/http://www.sowetan.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=413523|archivedate=2007-06-04|title=Women now 'raping' men|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref> Little research has been done on [[Rape by gender#Rape of females by females|female-female rape]].

===Australia===
The Australian Women's Safety Survey conducted by the Bureau of Statistics in 1996 involved a random sample 6,300 women aged 18 and over. It produced incidence finding of 1.9 per cent for sexual assault in the previous 12 months. Known men accounted for over two-thirds of assailants (68%). Only 15% of the assaulted women in the sample reported to the police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/F16680629C465E03CA256980007C4A81/$File/41280_1996.pdf |title=Women's Safety Australia – 1996 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref>

The report found that, in the small minority of rapes which are reported, a very common response is for law-enforcement officials, including
police and court staff, to arrange extralegal out-of-court 'agreements' between the victim and the perpetrator (or their families), in which the rapist pays a sum of money which is shared between the authorities and the victim (and her family), after which the victim has to withdraw any criminal complaint against the perpetrator, and public prosecutors close the case. When a rape is investigated, a complainant is generally expected to pay an extralegal sum of money to the authorities, to ensure that the court investigates the case, otherwise progress is slow, and it may take over two years for anything to happen. During the pre-trial period, there is always a risk that the perpetrator’s family will pay a bribe to secure his acquittal or reduced charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA23/001/2010/en/17ebf558-95f0-4cf8-98c1-3f052ffb9603/asa230012010en.pdf |title=BREAKING THE SILENCE&nbsp;— SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN CAMBODIA |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref>

===Canada===
The most frequently cited research was conducted by [[Statistics Canada]] in 1992, which involved a national random sample of 12,300 women (Johnson and Sacco, 1995).

The Independent. May 12, 2011.</ref> War rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo has frequently been described as a "weapon of war" by commentators. Louise Nzigire, a local social worker, states that “this violence was designed to exterminate the population.” Nzigire observes that rape has been a "cheap, simple weapon for all parties in the war, more easily obtainable than bullets or bombs."

===Denmark===
In 2008, Amnesty International produced the report ''Case Closed - Rape and human rights in the Nordic countries''. While this report criticized all countries (Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark), it expressed serious concerns in regard to Denmark, and, the organization has since engaged in a dialogue with the country in an attempt to convince it to change its laws. The Danish criminal provisions regarding sexual crimes, which have remained nearly unchanged during the last 30 years (unlike in other Western countries where sex legislation has changed dramatically during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, under pressure from feminists) have led Amnesty International to declare that "''Danish legislation on rape and sexual violence conflicts with human rights
''principles concerning the need to protect an individual’s sexual and physical integrity and right to self-determination''''". Danish laws on sexual crimes fall under a chapter called  "Vice Crimes", unlike in most Western countries, where modern definitions such as "Crimes against sexual freedom", or "Crimes against sexual self-determination" or simply "Sexual offenses" have replaced archaic wordings which send the message that rape violates public morality or public order, rather than the rights of an individual to bodily integrity. The definition of rape is very narrow focusing on violence and excludes many situations dealing with other forms of abuse, which, according to the report, are considered rape in  most other Western countries. However, the most severe problem with the Danish legislation is, according to Amnesty International, the fact that Denmark is one of few developed countries to maintain several marital exemptions in its legislation: while rape within marriage can be prosecuted (in fact Denmark was one of the first countries to allow for its prosecution), the definition of rape is very narrow and abusive sexual intercourse that falls outside the boundaries of rape is dealt under several other statues which explicitly state that the person commits a crime if he engages in "''extra-marital sexual intercourse''" with the victim, therefore excluding married victims. Furthermore, the law states that if the perpetrator enters into or continues a
marriage or registered partnership with the victim after the rape, it gives grounds for reducing or remitting punishment. Amnesty International has called these provisions "disturbing". In 2011, Amnesty has stated that "''Amnesty International has repeatedly urged the government [of Denmark] to bring legislation on rape in line with international law. It is very disappointing that Denmark has rejected related recommendations made in the review, referring to an expert review that has been pending for two years''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.dk/sites/default/files/mediafiles/44/case-closed.pdf |title=Case Closed: Rape and Human Rights in the Nordic Countries |publisher=Amnest yInternational |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ACT77/001/2010/en/5ba7f635-f2c3-4b50-86ea-e6c3428cf179/act770012010eng.pdf |title=Case Closed: Rape and Human Rights in the Nordic Countries, Summary Report |publisher=Amnesty International |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR18/001/2011/en/7a777ab6-deff-4ec0-9fb0-62d1fa6d1a06/eur180012011en.pdf |title=Amnesty International Public Statement |publisher=Amnesty International |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref>

==False accusation==
{{Main|False accusation of rape}}

The largest and most rigorous study was commissioned by the British Home Office and based on 2,643 sexual assault cases (Kelly, Lovett, and Regan, 2005). Of these, 8% were classified by the police department as false reports. However, the researchers noted that some of these classifications were based simply on the personal judgments of the police investigators and were made in violation of official criteria for establishing a false allegation. Closer analysis of this category applying the Home Office counting rules for establishing a false allegation and excluding cases where the application of the cases where confirmation of the designation was uncertain reduced the percentage of false reports to 3%. The researchers concluded that "one cannot take all police designations at face value" and that "[t]here is an over-estimation of the scale of false allegations by both police officers and prosecutors." Moreover, they added:

{{quote|The interviews with police officers and complainants’ responses show that despite the focus on victim care, a culture of suspicion remains within the police, even amongst some of those who are specialists in rape investigations. There is also a tendency to conflate false allegations with retractions and withdrawals, as if in all such cases no sexual assault occurred. This reproduces an investigative culture in which elements that might permit a designation of a false complaint are emphasized (later sections reveal how this also feeds into withdrawals and designation of 'insufficient evidence'), at the expense of a careful investigation, in which the evidence collected is evaluated.<ref>[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf A gap or a chasm? Attrition in reported rape cases] Home Office Research&nbsp;— February 2005</ref><ref name="Sexual assault: key issues"/>}}

Another large-scale study was conducted in Australia, with the 850 rapes reported to the Victoria police between 2000 and 2003 (Heenan & Murray, 2006). Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, the researchers examined 812 cases with sufficient information to make an appropriate determination, and found that 2.1% of these were classified by police as false reports. All of these complainants were then charged or threatened with charges for filing a false police report.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/app/abstractdb/AbstractDBDetails.aspx?id=243182 |title=Abstracts Database&nbsp;— National Criminal Justice Reference Service |publisher=Ncjrs.gov |accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref>

FBI reports consistently put the number of "unfounded" rape accusations around 8%. Two notable examples are [[Tawana Brawley rape allegations]] and the [[Duke lacrosse case]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/college/lacrosse/bal-sp.duke22feb22,0,156697.story|title=Other Duke players, parents file lawsuit|publisher=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=May 22, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5h6xQmtsw|archivedate=May 28, 2009|deadurl=no}}</ref> The unfounded rate is higher for forcible rape than for any other Index crime.

Attorney General’s Sexual Assault Task Force Oregon, US January 10, 2008.</ref> and as Bruce Gross of the Forensic Examiner explains,

{{quote|This statistic is almost meaningless, as many of the jurisdictions from which the FBI collects data on crime use different definitions of, or criteria for, "unfounded." That is, a report of rape might be classified as unfounded (rather than as forcible rape) if the alleged victim did not try to fight off the suspect, if the alleged perpetrator did not use physical force or a weapon of some sort, if the alleged victim did not sustain any physical injuries, or if the alleged victim and the accused had a prior sexual relationship. Similarly, a report might be deemed unfounded if there is no physical evidence or too many inconsistencies between the accuser's statement and what evidence does exist. As such, although some unfounded cases of rape may be false or fabricated, not all unfounded cases are false.|<ref name="AAOJ"/>}}

It is most commonly reported that around 2% of reported rape cases are false accusations. In an academic review in the Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review, Edward Greer could not find primary sources for this often repeated figure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://llr.lls.edu/volumes/v33-issue3/greer.pdf |title=The Truth Behind Legal Dominance Feminism's "Two Percent False Rape Claim" Figure |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref> A 2006 review by Philip Rumney in the Cambridge Law Journal found several that supported that the figure is around 2%, but only one small (545-case) study that could be a source of the 2% figure,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=430299 |title=Cambridge Journals Online&nbsp;— Abstract |doi=10.1017/S0008197306007069 |publisher=Journals.cambridge.org |date=2006-04-19 |accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref> and expressed doubt about each's methodology.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bazelon |first=Emily |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2231012/ |title=How Often Do Women Falsely Cry Rape? |publisher=Slate.com |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref>

Purdue sociologist Eugene Kanin (1994) summarized rape reports in a small Midwestern town between 1978 and 1987 and found that the police department determined 41% of the 109 sexual assault reports to be false. The police department made a "serious offer to polygraph" all rape complainants. [[David Lisak]] (2007) argues that Kanin’s is not a research study, because it only puts forth the opinions of the police officers without any further investigation on his part and that it is "a provocative opinion piece, but it is not a scientific study of the issue of false reporting of rape" and that it "certainly should never be used to assert a scientific foundation for the frequency of false allegations."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndaa.org/pdf/the_voice_vol_3_no_1_2009.pdf |title=False Reports: Moving Beyond the Issue to Successfully Investigate and Prosecute Non-Stranger Sexual Assault |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.depaul.edu/centers_institutes/family_law/pdf/duke_lacrosse_case.pdf |title=Duke lacrosse case_1 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref> Similarly, John Bancroft states that a search of the literature on false rape reports reveals that Kanin's figure of 41% false rape reports is regarded as unusually high.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Bancroft|title=Sexual development in childhood|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bibbgdfPg3AC&pg=PA439|accessdate=1 October 2011|date=November 2003|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-34243-0|pages=439–}}</ref>  Kanin claimed that "the complainant must admit that no rape had occurred. She is the sole agent who can say that the rape charge is false." Lisak accused Kanin of presenting the claims of the police department as fact, without investigating further:

{{quote|"Kanin describes no effort to systemize his own 'evaluation' of the police reports—for example, by listing details or facts that he used to evaluate the criteria used by the police to draw their conclusions. Nor does Kanin describe any effort to compare his evaluation of those reports to that of a second, independent research— providing a ‘reliability’ analysis. This violates a cardinal rule of science, a rule designed to ensure that observations are not simply the reflection of the bias of the observer [...] [Dr. Kanin] simply reiterates the opinions of the police officers who concluded that the cases in question were 'false allegations.'"}}

Lisak later performed his own study, published in 2010 in ''Violence Against Women'', which found a false allegation rate of 5.9%.

==History==
{{Main|History of rape}}
In [[ancient history]], rape was viewed less as a type of assault on the female, than a serious property crime against the man to whom she belonged, typically the father or husband. The loss of [[virginity]] was an especially serious matter. The damage due to loss of virginity was reflected in her reduced prospects in finding a husband and in her [[bride price]]. This was especially true in the case of betrothed virgins, as the loss of [[chastity]] was perceived as severely depreciating her value to a prospective husband. In such cases, the law would void the betrothal and demand financial compensation from the rapist, payable to the woman's household, whose "goods" were "damaged".<ref>[[Hammurabi's Code]] #156</ref>
Under [[biblical law]], the rapist might be compelled to marry the unmarried woman instead of receiving the civil penalty if her father agreed. This was especially prevalent in laws where the crime of rape did not include, as a necessary element, the violation of the woman's body, thus dividing the crime in the current meaning of rape and a means for a man and woman to force their families to permit [[marriage]]. (See {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:28–29|NIV}}.)

The word ''rape'' itself originates from the [[Latin]] verb ''[[wikt:rapere|rapere]]'': to seize or take by force. The word originally had no sexual connotation and is still used generically in English. The history of rape, and the alterations of its meaning, is quite complex. In [[Roman law]], rape, or ''raptus'' was classified as a form of ''crimen vis'', "crime of assault."<ref>[[Justinian]], ''Institutiones'' [http://www.constitution.org/sps/sps02_j1-4.htm]</ref><ref>Adolf Berger, ''Encyclopedic Dictionary on Roman Law'', pp. 667 (''raptus'') and 768 (''vis'') [http://books.google.com/books?id=iklePELtR6QC]</ref> The concept of ''raptus'' was applied to the abduction of a woman against the will of the man under whose authority she lived, and sexual intercourse was not even a necessary element. Like theft or robbery, rape was originally considered a "private wrong" ''iniuria privita'', a crime between the abductor and the legal guardian of the woman in question. It was made into a "public wrong" ''iniuria publica'' by the Roman Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]].<ref name="Eckman">{{cite web|url=http://medievalists.net/files/11020201.pdf|title=An Oppressive Silence: The Evolution of the Raped Woman in Medieval France and England|author=Zoë Eckman}}{{verify source|date=December 2012}}</ref><ref>George Mousourakis, ''The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law'' p. 30 [http://books.google.com/books?id=8qE1zFHyGXoC]</ref> [[Augustus]] Caesar enacted reforms for the crime of rape under the assault statute ''Lex Iulia de vi publica'', which bears his family name, ''Iulia''. It was under this statute rather than the adultery statute of ''Lex Iulia de adulteriis'' that Rome prosecuted this crime.<ref>James Fitzjames Stephen, ''A History of the Criminal Law of England'', p. 17 [http://books.google.com/books?id=jecTHASFYeUC]</ref> Emperor [[Justinian]] confirmed the continued use of the statute to prosecute rape during the 6th century in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].<ref>[[Justinian]] [http://www.constitution.org/sps/sps02_j1-4.htm ''Institutiones'']</ref>
By [[late antiquity]], the general term ''raptus'' had referred to abduction, elopement, robbery, or rape in its modern meaning. Confusion over the term led ecclesial commentators on the law to differentiate it into ''raptus seductionis'' (elopement without parental consent) and ''raptus violentiae'' (ravishment). Both of these forms of ''raptus'' had a civil penalty and possible excommunication for the family and village receiving the abducted woman, although ''raptus violentiae'' also incurred punishments of mutilation or death.<ref>[[Basil of Caesarea]], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf208.ix.cclxxi.html ''Letters''] circa 374 AD</ref>

From the classical antiquity of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] into the [[Colonialism|Colonial period]], rape along with [[arson]], [[treason]] and [[murder]] was a [[capital offense]]. "Those committing rape were subject to a wide range of capital punishments that were seemingly brutal, frequently bloody, and at times spectacular." In the 12th century, kinsmen of the victim were given the option of executing the punishment themselves. "In [[England]] in the early fourteenth century, a victim of rape might be expected to gouge out the eyes and/or sever the offender's testicles herself."<ref>"The Medieval Blood Sanction and the Divine Beneficene of Pain: 1100–1450", Trisha Olson, ''Journal of Law and Religion'', 22 JLREL 63 (2006)</ref> Despite the harshness of these laws, actual punishments were usually far less severe: in late Medieval Europe, cases concerning rapes of marriageable women, wives, widows, or members of the lower class were rarely brought forward, and usually ended with only a small monetary fine or a marriage between the victim and the rapist.<ref name="Eckman" /> Adult women were often extremely reluctant to bring up charges of rape: public admission of having been raped was severely damaging to one's social standing, courts tended to be skeptical of the charges, conviction rates were low, and, in the event that the accusation could not be proved, the victim could then be accused of committing adultery with the rapist (traditionally a serious offense that could have been punished by mutilation<ref>{{cite journal|title=Amputation of the nose throughout history|author=G Sperati | pmc=2689568 | pmid=19609383|volume=29|issue=1|year=2009|month=February|journal=Acta Otorhinolaryngol Ital|pages=44–50}}</ref> or even death.)

The ''[[ius primae noctis]]'' ("law of the first night") is a term now popularly used to describe an alleged legal right allowing the lord of an estate to take the [[virginity]] of his [[serf]]s' maiden daughters. Little or no historical evidence has been unearthed from the Middle Ages to support the idea that such a right ever actually existed.<ref>[http://www.fibri.de/jus/arthbes.htm The jus primae noctis as a male power display: A review of historic sources with evolutionary interpretation].

The medieval theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that rape, though sinful, was much less unacceptable than [[masturbation]] or [[coitus interruptus]], because it fulfilled the procreative function of sex, while the other acts violated the purpose of sex.<ref>Alan Soble, ''Sexual Investigations'', NYU Press, 1998, p.10-11.</ref><ref>Vern L. Bullough, Bonnie Bullough, ''Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia''</ref><ref>[[Daphne Hampson]], ''After Christianity''</ref>

The legal view of the concept of rape began changing gradually in the late Middle Ages. 12th century [[Decretum Gratiani|Codex of Gratian]]  clearly distinguished between abduction and rape, and considered the intercourse without consent of one of the partners a necessary element. By the mid-1500s, European courts began recognizing the concept of [[age of consent]], namely, that minors under a certain age, such as 12, would be incapable of consenting to intercourse.<ref name="Eckman" />

In Medieval Europe, a woman could be legally [[Forced marriage|married]] by her parents to a stranger without her consent, and, once she was married, she could no longer refuse to consent to sex: the medieval concept of rape did not allow for the possibility of being raped by one's husband. In 1563, the [[Council of Trent]] expressly declared that legal Catholic marriages had to be done with consent of both parties, but did not require parental consent, essentially declaring forced marriages invalid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct24.html|title=The Council of Trent, The Twenty-Fourth Session}}</ref> This was not universally accepted: for example, in France, women were not granted the right to marry without parental consent until 1793.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcr.org/tcr/essays/CB_Women-French_Rev.pdf|title=Women in the French revolution}}</ref>

During the [[Colonization]] of the Americas, the rape of native women was not held to be a crime under Spanish Law as the persons in question were Pagan and not Christian.<ref>[http://www.discoverhaiti.com/history00_4_1.htm Discover Haiti: Haiti History – The Conquistadors -Spanish Conquest]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/10/08/4398/|title=Columbus Day&nbsp;— As Rape Rules Africa and American Churches Embrace Violent 'Christian' Video Games|last=Hartmann|first=Thom|date=October 8, 2007|work=[[Common Dreams NewsCenter]]|publisher=CommonDreams.org}}{{verify credibility|date=May 2012}}</ref> 

In 1814, Swiss explorer [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt|Johann Burckhardt]] wrote of his travels in [[Egypt]] and [[Nubia]], where he saw the practice of slave trading: "I frequently witnessed scenes of the most shameless indecency, which the traders, who were the principal actors, only laughed at. I may venture to state, that very few female slaves who have passed their tenth year, reach Egypt or Arabia in a state of virginity."<ref>[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burckhardt/john_lewis//nubia/chapter2.html Travels in Nubia, by John Lewis Burckhardt]</ref>

Until fairly recently, the criminal justice system of many countries was widely regarded as unfair to sexual assault victims. Both sexist stereotypes and common law combined to make rape a "criminal proceeding on which the victim and her behavior were tried rather than the defendant".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Angela Marie Howard Zophy|author2=Angela Howard|author3=Frances M. Kavenik|title=Handbook of American women's history|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-yUqAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=1 October 2011|year=1990|publisher=Garland|isbn=978-0-8240-8744-9}}</ref> Additionally, gender neutral laws have combated the older perception that rape never occurs to men,<ref name="LaFave"/> while other laws have eliminated the term altogether.<ref>Michigan Statutes for the first degree felony, section 520b, "(1) A person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree if he or she engages in sexual penetration of another person.", or in England and Wales, Section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 "1. A person (A) commits an offence if – (a) he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person..." – although in this case women are still not capable of committing rape.</ref>

Since the 1970s, many changes have occurred in the perception of sexual assault due in large part to the [[feminist movement]] and its public characterization of rape as a crime of power and control rather than purely of sex. In some countries the women's liberation movement of the 1970s created the first [[rape crisis center]]s. One of the first two rape crisis centers, the D.C. Rape Crisis Center, opened in 1972. It was created to promote sensitivity and understanding of rape and its effects on the victim. In 1960 law enforcement cited false reporting rates at 20%. By 1973 the statistics had dropped to 15%.

Wartime propaganda often alleges, and exaggerates, mistreatment of the civilian population by enemy forces and allegations of rape figure prominently in this. As a result, it is often very difficult, both practically and politically, to assemble an accurate view of what really happened.

Commenting on rape of women and children in recent African conflict zones [[UNICEF]] said that rape was no longer just perpetrated by combatants but also by civilians. According to UNICEF rape is common in countries affected by wars and natural disasters, drawing a link between the occurrence of sexual violence with the significant uprooting of a society and the crumbling of social norms. UNICEF states that in Kenya reported cases of sexual violence doubled within days of post-election conflicts. According to UNICEF rape was prevalent in conflict zones in [[Sudan]], [[Chad]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7242421.stm|title=Africa war zones' 'rape epidemic'|publisher=BBC News | date=February 13, 2008 | accessdate=January 4, 2010}}</ref> It is estimated that more than 200,000 females living in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] today have been raped in recent conflicts.<ref name="film.guardian.co.uk"/><ref name="pbs.org"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/thegreatestsilence/ |title=The Greatest Silence: Home |publisher=HBO |accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref> Some estimate that around 60% of combatants in Congo are [[HIV]]-infected.<ref>"[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/06/26/ING04DDSNI1.DTL&hw=Rape+as+weapon+of+war&sn=004&sc=380 Rape as a weapon of war]".

In 1998, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] found that systematic rape was used in the [[Rwandan genocide]]. The Tribunal held that "sexual assault [in Rwanda] formed an integral part of the process of destroying the [[Tutsi]] ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only, manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide."<ref name="unreport"/> An estimated 500,000 women were raped during the 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide]].<ref name="Violence Against Women: Worldwide Statistics"/>

The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]], which defines the jurisdiction of the [[International Criminal Court]], recognizes rape, sexual slavery, enforced [[prostitution]], [[forced pregnancy]], [[compulsory sterilization|enforced sterilization]], "or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity" as [[Crimes against humanity|crime against humanity]] if the action is part of a widespread or systematic practice.<ref name="Horton"/><ref name="untreaty"/>

Rape was first recognized as [[crime against humanity]] when the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] issued arrest warrants based on the [[Geneva Conventions]] and Violations of the Laws or Customs of War. Specifically, it was recognised that Muslim women in [[Foča]] (southeastern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]) were subjected to systematic and widespread gang rape, torture and enslavement by Bosnian Serb soldiers, policemen and members of paramilitary groups after the takeover of the city in April 1992.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

The indictment was of major legal significance and was the first time that sexual assaults were investigated for the purpose of prosecution under the rubric of torture and enslavement as a [[crime against humanity]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The indictment was confirmed by a 2001 verdict of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] that rape and sexual enslavement are crimes against humanity. [[Amnesty International]] stated that the ruling challenged the widespread acceptance of the torture of women as an intrinsic part of war.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090907091105/http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR630042001?open&of=ENG-BIH Bosnia-Herzegovina : Foca verdict – rape and sexual enslavement are crimes against humanity].
