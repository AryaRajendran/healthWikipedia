'''Broda Otto Barnes''' (14 April 1906 &ndash; 1 November 1988) was an American [[physician]] who studied [[endocrine dysfunction]], particularly [[hypothyroidism]].<ref name="riddleillness">{{cite book |last=Langer |first=Stephan |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Solved: The Riddle of Illness. |year=2000 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] | url=http://books.google.com/?id=v-8xz2eiAkMC&printsec=frontcover#PPR17,M1 |isbn=0-658-00293-7 }}</ref><ref name="barnesfound">{{cite web |url=http://brodabarnes.org/who_we_are.htm |title=Broda O. Barnes |accessdate=2008-04-16 |publisher=Broda O. Barnes MD Research Foundation, Inc. }}</ref> In the 1970s, Barnes published several books arguing that [[hypothyroidism]] was underdiagnosed in the U.S. and was responsible for a wide range of health problems. Barnes' views on the prevalence of hypothyroidism were never widely accepted by the medical community and run counter to the current medical understanding of thyroid function, but they have been embraced by some elements of the [[alternative medicine]] community.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Alan Gaby |title="Sub-laboratory" Hypothyroidism and the Empirical use of Armour Thyroid |journal=Alternative Medicine Review |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=157–179 |year=2004 |url=http://www.thorne.com/media/hypothyroidism9-2.pdf|format=PDF |pmid=15253676}}</ref>

==Career==
Barnes was born on April 14, 1906 in a log cabin in [[Missouri]],<ref name="riddleillness"/><ref>[[Social Security Death Index]]; 14 Apr 1906 &ndash; 01 Nov 1988</ref> the son of Addie and Robert B. Barnes.<ref>[[1920 US Census]] for [[Douglas County, Colorado]]</ref> Barnes studied chemistry at the [[University of Denver]], and became an instructor of physiological chemistry at [[Western Reserve University]] for two years, receiving his [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in 1930. Barnes received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1931 and taught physiology there from 1931 to 1936.<ref name="riddleillness"/><ref name=uoc/> He completed his [[M.D.]] in 1937 at [[Rush Medical College]], and for two years he was an [[Assistant Professor]] of Medicine at the [[University of Illinois]].<ref name=Illinois/> He was named chairman of the Health Education Department at the [[University of Denver]]. He became professor affiliate in the department of physiology at [[Colorado State University]] from 1963 to 1968.<ref name="riddleillness"/> On 13 September 1981 he married Helen Tucker Morgan (1905–2002) in California. She was his second wife.<ref name=marriage/>

In 1984, Barnes established a [[not-for-profit]] foundation, the Broda O. Barnes Research Foundation, to continue to advocate his arguments about hypothyroidism.<ref name="barnesfound"/><ref name=uoc/> Barnes and his wife also established a program of interest-free [[student loan]]s to aid "worthy and needy chemistry students" at the University of Denver.<ref>{{cite web| title = Financial Aid and Scholarships | publisher = Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, [[University of Denver]] | url = http://www.chemistry.du.edu/prospective/finaid.cfm | date = January 1, 2006 | accessdate = May 18, 2009}}</ref> The [[University of Chicago]] library retains a collection of memorabilia, consisting largely of photographs related to Barnes' time there.<ref name=uoc>{{cite web |url=http://ead.lib.uchicago.edu/view.xqy?id=ICU.SPCL.BARNESBO&c=b |title=Guide to the Broda Otto Barnes Papers |accessdate=2009-04-29 |publisher=[[University of Chicago]] }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

== Hypothyroidism perspective ==

Barnes developed and promoted a diagnostic test for thyroid function that became known as the "Barnes Basal Temperature Test". This test is performed by placing a thermometer in the armpit for 10 minutes immediately upon waking.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Silent epidemic - the underactive thyroid |url=http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20061204/news/news8.html |work=[[Jamaica Gleaner]] |date=December 4, 2006 |accessdate=2009-04-28 }}</ref> Barnes considered a measurement of {{convert|97.8|F|C}} or below to be highly indicative of hypothyroidism, especially when hypothyroid symptoms are present. Barnes believed that a reading over {{convert|98.2|F|C}} was indicative of [[hyperthyroidism|''hyper''thyroidism]], unless a patient had advanced arthritis, which he claimed would falsely elevate the temperature due to muscle contractions.<ref name="unsuspectill">{{cite book |last=Barnes |first=Broda |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Hypothyroidism: the Unsuspected Illness |year=1976 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] | url=http://books.google.com/?id=2sqMx5UdZbcC&dq=broda+barnes |isbn=0-690-01029-X }}</ref> 

The details of the test were published in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' (JAMA) in August 1942.<ref name="unsuspectill" /> The test has never been adopted by the medical profession; however, it was subsequently promoted by Barnes in a series of books, and is currently advocated by some [[alternative medicine]] practitioners. In modern medical practice, the most accurate means of assessing thyroid function is through [[thyroid function test|specific biochemical tests]] which measure blood levels of thyroid gland hormones and regulators.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vanderpump MP, Ahlquist JA, Franklyn JA, Clayton RN |title=Consensus statement for good practice and audit measures in the management of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. The Research Unit of the Royal College of Physicians of London, the Endocrinology and Diabetes Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of London, and the Society for Endocrinology |journal=BMJ |volume=313 |issue=7056 |pages=539–44 |year=1996 |month=August |pmid=8789985 |pmc=2351923 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8789985}}</ref>

Barnes didn't consider his Basal Temperature Test to be 100% conclusive, and acknowledged there were other causes of lowered basal temperature. Nevertheless, he maintained that it was superior to [[thyroid function test|blood tests of thyroid function]].<ref name="barnesfound"/> In his books, Barnes argued that hypothyroidism affected more than 40% of the American population,<ref name="unsuspectill"/><ref name="barnesfound"/> significantly higher than the [[prevalence]] of approximately 5% reported in the [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] medical literature.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hollowell JG |title=Serum TSH, T(4), and thyroid antibodies in the United States population (1988 to 1994): National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) |journal=J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=489–99 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11836274 |url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11836274 |doi=10.1210/jc.87.2.489 |author-separator=, |author2=Staehling NW |author3=Flanders WD |display-authors=3 |last4=Hannon |first4=WH |last5=Gunter |first5=EW |last6=Spencer |first6=CA |last7=Braverman |first7=LE}}</ref>

Barnes believed that many common diseases, including heart disease, cancer, depression, arthritis, diabetes, the [[common cold]], tonsillitis, [[otitis media|ear infections]], apparent laziness in children, various [[dysmenorrhea|menstrual disorders]], and skin disorders, were all caused or exacerbated by hypothyroidism.<ref name="unsuspectill"/><ref name="barnesfound"/>

=== Treatment ===
Barnes treated hypothyroidism by prescribing patients a daily dose of thyroid hormone. He recommended starting with a small dose, and then slowly increasing the dosage in monthly intervals until symptoms resolved. For most patients, he recommended continuing thyroid medication for life at that optimal dose, though some could be slowly weaned off.<ref name="barnesfound"/> Barnes used a [[desiccated thyroid extract]], Armour Thyroid, almost exclusively, based on his [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotal observation]] that it was superior to synthetic hormones.<ref name="barnesfound"/>

During his years of practice, Barnes also began to believe that virtually all his hypothyroid patients had concomitant undiagnosed [[adrenal insufficiency]]. Based on this speculation, he routinely prescribed an accompanying dose of the synthetic [[corticosteroid]] [[prednisone]]. Barnes argued that it was mandatory to give prednisone to patients with a [[systolic blood pressure]] below 100.<ref name="unsuspectill"/><ref name="barnesfound"/>

== Pregnancy mistest hormone research ==

In 1932, W. Fleischmann and S. Kann reported in a German gestational physiology journal<ref name="Fleisch1938">{{cite journal | last1=Fleischman |first= W. |last2=Kann |first2= S.|title=Ueber eine Funktioni des wveiblichen Sexualhormons bei Fischen (Wachstum der Legeroehre des Bitterlings)| journal =  Arch. f. d. ges. Physiol. |year=1932|volume=230 |pages= 662 | language=German }} See footnote 1 at {{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.87.2257.305 | title = The Bitterling Ovipositor Reaction to Corticosterone | year = 1938 | last1 = Fleischmann | first1 = W. | last2 = Kann | first2 = S. | journal = Science | volume = 87 | issue = 2257 | pages = 305–6 | pmid = 17835376  }}</ref> that female bitterings, small carp-like fish, "...show an enlargement of the ovipositor following injection of an estrogenic preparation...".<ref name="Fleisch1938"/> 

Since human pregnancy urine contains [[estrogen]], Drs. Aaron E. Kanter, Carl P. Bauer and Arthur H. Klawans of the University of Chicago added a teaspoon of urine from a pregnant woman to a bowl in which a bitterling was swimming. This experiment produced ovipositor lengthening, as expected by reasoning from the earlier results of Fleischmann. In 1935, TIME Magazine nationally reported their announcement of this potentially useful new test for human pregnancy, which was then currently determined by [[rabbit test|rabbit and mouse tests]]. But subsequent to the announcement, Kanter, et al., found that urine from non-pregnant women or men had the same effect.<ref name="DecepBit"/>

Barnes was the principal investigator, with obstetricians Kanter and Klawans, in an experiment reported in 1936. They sought to determine the source organ of whatever non-pregnant urine substance was causing the same bitterling ovipositor response as Fleischmann's estrogenic preparation.<ref name="DecepBit"/> Barnes, et al., extracted juice from 14 different organs of seven species (including both genders of humans) and exposed bitterlings to them. The organ they found responsible was the [[adrenal cortex]].<ref>{{cite journal |date=2 October 1936|title =Bitterling Ovipositor Lengthening Produced By Adrenal Extracts |author =Barnes BO, Kanter AE, Klawans AH |journal =[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume =84 |issue =2179 |pages =310 |publisher =[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] |url =http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/citation/84/2179/310-a |doi=10.1126/science.84.2179.310-a |pmid=17837041 }}</ref> The Barnes, et al., 1936, publication in ''Science'' was also reported in TIME.<ref name="DecepBit"/>

In 1938, Fleischmann and Kann determined that in addition to estrogen, a specific adrenal hormone, [[corticosterone]], could cause the observed bitterling ovipositor reaction.<ref name="Fleisch1938" /> This additional non-pregnant hormone reaction made the bitterling test not useful for its originally announced purpose, though it did open the door to an investigation of why corticosterone is significant in urine.<ref name="DecepBit">{{cite news |title=Deceptive Bitterling |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,848651,00.html |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date=October 12, 1936 |accessdate=2008-04-16 }}</ref>
