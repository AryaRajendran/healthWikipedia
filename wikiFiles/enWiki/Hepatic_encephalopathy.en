'''Hepatic encephalopathy''' (also known as '''portosystemic encephalopathy''') is the occurrence of [[mental confusion|confusion]], [[altered level of consciousness]], and [[coma]] as a result of [[liver failure]]. In the advanced stages it is called '''hepatic coma''' or '''coma hepaticum'''. It may ultimately lead to death.<ref name=Cash/>

It is caused by accumulation in the bloodstream of toxic substances that are normally removed by the [[liver]]. The diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy requires the presence of impaired liver function and the exclusion of an alternative explanation for the symptoms. [[Blood test]]s ([[ammonia]] levels) may assist in the diagnosis. Attacks are often precipitated by an intercurrent problem, such as [[infection]] or [[constipation]].<ref name=Cash/><ref name=ChungPodolsky/>

Hepatic encephalopathy is reversible with treatment. This relies on suppressing the production of the toxic substances in the [[intestine]] and is most commonly done with the laxative [[lactulose]] or with non-absorbable [[antibiotic]]s. In addition, the treatment of any underlying condition may improve the symptoms. In particular settings, such as [[acute liver failure]], the onset of encephalopathy may indicate the need for a [[Liver transplantation|liver transplant]].<ref name=Cash/><ref name=Polson/>

==Signs and symptoms==
The mildest form of hepatic encephalopathy is difficult to detect clinically, but may be demonstrated on [[neuropsychological test]]ing. It is experienced as forgetfulness, mild confusion, and irritability. The first stage of hepatic encephalopathy is characterised by an inverted sleep-wake pattern (sleeping by day, being awake at night). The second stage is marked by lethargy and personality changes. The third stage is marked by worsened confusion. The fourth stage is marked by a progression to coma.<ref name=Cash>{{cite journal |author=Cash WJ, McConville P, McDermott E, McCormick PA, Callender ME, McDougall NI |title=Current concepts in the assessment and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy |journal=QJM |volume=103 |issue=1 |pages=9–16 |year=2010 |month=January |pmid=19903725 |doi=10.1093/qjmed/hcp152}}</ref>

More severe forms of hepatic encephalopathy lead to a worsening level of consciousness, from lethargy to [[somnolence]] and eventually coma. In the intermediate stages, a characteristic jerking movement of the limbs is observed ([[asterixis]], "liver flap" due to its flapping character); this disappears as the somnolence worsens. There is disorientation and amnesia, and uninhibited behaviour may occur. In the third stage, [[neurological examination]] may reveal [[clonus]] and positive [[Plantar reflex|Babinski sign]]. Coma and [[seizure]]s represent the most advanced stage; [[Cerebral edema|cerebral oedema]] (swelling of the brain tissue) leads to death.<ref name=Cash/>

Encephalopathy often occurs together with other symptoms and signs of liver failure. These may include [[jaundice]] (yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites of the eyes), [[ascites]] (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and [[peripheral edema|peripheral oedema]] (swelling of the legs due to fluid build-up in the skin). The [[tendon reflex]]es may be exaggerated, and the [[plantar reflex]] may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (Babinski's sign) in severe encephalopathy. A particular smell (''[[Fetor hepaticus|foetor hepaticus]]'') may be detected.<ref name=ChungPodolsky>{{cite book |author=Chung RT, Podolsky DK |editor=Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, ''et al.'' |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|edition=16th |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-07-139140-1 |pages=1858–69 |chapter=Cirrhosis and its complications}}</ref>

==Causes==

In a small proportion of cases, the encephalopathy is caused directly by liver failure; this is more likely in acute liver failure. More commonly, especially in chronic liver disease, hepatic encephalopathy is caused or aggravated by an additional cause, and identifying these causes can be important to treat the episode effectively.<ref name=Cash/>

Hepatic encephalopathy may also occur after the creation of a [[transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt]] (TIPSS). This is used in the treatment of refractory [[ascites]], bleeding from [[oesophageal varices]] and [[hepatorenal syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Khan S, Tudur Smith C, Williamson P, Sutton R |title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD000553 |year=2006 |pmid=17054131 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000553.pub2 |url=http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD000553/frame.html |chapter=Portosystemic shunts versus endoscopic therapy for variceal rebleeding in patients with cirrhosis |editor1-last=Khan |editor1-first=Saboor A}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Saab S, Nieto JM, Lewis SK, Runyon BA |title=TIPSS versus paracentesis for cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD004889 |year=2006 |pmid=17054221 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004889.pub2 |url=http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD004889/frame.html |chapter=TIPS versus paracentesis for cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites |editor1-last=Saab |editor1-first=Sammy}}</ref> TIPSS-related encephalopathy occurs in about 30% of cases, with the risk being higher in those with previous episodes of encephalopathy, higher age, female sex and liver disease due to causes other than alcohol.<ref name=Sundaram/>

==Classification and grading==
===West Haven Criteria===
The severity of hepatic encephalopathy is graded with the West Haven Criteria; this is based on the level of impairment of autonomy, changes in consciousness, intellectual function, behavior, and the dependence on therapy.<ref name=Cash/><ref name=Ferenci/><ref name=Conn>{{cite journal |author=Conn HO, Leevy CM, Vlahcevic ZR, ''et al.'' |title=Comparison of lactulose and neomycin in the treatment of chronic portal-systemic encephalopathy.

* Grade 1 - Trivial lack of awareness; euphoria or anxiety; shortened attention span; impaired performance of addition or subtraction
* Grade 2 - Lethargy or [[apathy]]; minimal disorientation for time or place; subtle personality change; inappropriate behaviour
* Grade 3 - [[Somnolence]] to semi[[stupor]], but responsive to verbal stimuli; confusion; gross disorientation
* Grade 4 - [[Coma]] (unresponsive to verbal or noxious stimuli)

===Types===
[[Image:Cirrhosis high mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] showing liver [[cirrhosis]], a condition that often precedes hepatic encephalopathy. [[Trichrome stain]].]]
A classification of hepatic encephalopathy was introduced at the World Congress of [[Gastroenterology]] 1998 in Vienna. According to this classification, hepatic encephalopathy is subdivided in type A, B and C depending on the underlying cause.<ref name=Ferenci>{{cite journal |author=Ferenci P, Lockwood A, Mullen K, Tarter R, Weissenborn K, Blei A |title=Hepatic encephalopathy--definition, nomenclature, diagnosis, and quantification: final report of the working party at the 11th World Congresses of Gastroenterology, Vienna, 1998 |journal=Hepatology |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=716–21 |year=2002 |pmid=11870389 |doi=10.1053/jhep.2002.31250 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/106597607/PDFSTART}}</ref>
* ''Type A (=acute)'' describes hepatic encephalopathy associated with [[acute liver failure]], typically associated with [[cerebral edema|cerebral oedema]]
* ''Type B (=[[Bypass (surgical)|bypass]])'' is caused by portal-systemic shunting without associated intrinsic liver disease
* ''Type C (=[[cirrhosis]]'') occurs in patients with [[cirrhosis]] - this type is subdivided in ''episodic'', ''persistent'' and ''minimal'' encephalopathy

The term ''minimal encephalopathy'' (MHE) is defined as encephalopathy that does not lead to clinically overt cognitive dysfunction, but can be demonstrated with neuropsychological studies.<ref name=Ferenci/><ref name=Randolph>{{cite journal |author=Randolph C, Hilsabeck R, Kato A, ''et al.'' |title=Neuropsychological assessment of hepatic encephalopathy: ISHEN practice guidelines |journal=Liver Int. |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=629–35 |year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19302444 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-3231.2009.02009.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/122267652/HTMLSTART}}</ref> This is still an important finding, as minimal encephalopathy has been demonstrated to impair [[quality of life]] and increase the risk of involvement in [[Traffic collision|road traffic accidents]].<ref name=Bajaj/>

==Pathogenesis==
[[Image:Ammonia-3D-balls-A.png|right|thumb|Image of ball and stick model of ammonia; one nitrogen atom with three hydrogen atoms. Accumulation of [[ammonia]] in the bloodstream is associated with hepatic encephalopathy.]]
There are various explanations why liver dysfunction or portosystemic shunting might lead to encephalopathy. In healthy subjects, [[nitrogen]]-containing compounds from the [[intestine]], generated by [[gut flora|gut bacteria]] from food, are transported by the [[portal vein]] to the liver, where 80–90% is [[metabolism|metabolised]] through the [[urea cycle]] and/or excreted immediately. This process is impaired in all subtypes of hepatic encephalopathy, either because the [[hepatocyte]]s (liver cells) are incapable of metabolising the waste products or because portal venous blood bypasses the liver through [[collateral circulation]] or a medically constructed shunt. Nitrogenous waste products accumulate in the [[systemic circulation]] (hence the older term "portosystemic encephalopathy"). The most important waste product is [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>). This small molecule crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]] and is absorbed and metabolised by the [[astrocyte]]s, a population of cells in the brain that constitutes 30% of the [[cerebral cortex]]. Astrocytes use ammonia when synthesising [[glutamine]] from [[glutamate]]. The increased levels of glutamine lead to an increase in osmotic pressure in the astrocytes, which become swollen. There is increased activity of the inhibitory [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|γ-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA) system, and the energy supply to other brain cells is decreased. This can be thought of as an example of brain oedema of the "cytotoxic" type.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ryan JM, Shawcross DL |title=Hepatic encephalopathy|journal=Medicine |volume=39 |issue=10|pages=617–620 |year=2011 |doi=10.1016/j.mpmed.2011.07.008}}</ref>

Despite numerous studies demonstrating the central role of ammonia, ammonia levels don't always correlate with the severity of the encephalopathy; it is suspected that this means that more ammonia has already been absorbed into the brain in those with severe symptoms whose serum levels are relatively low.<ref name=Cash/><ref name=ChungPodolsky/> Other waste products implicated in hepatic encephalopathy include [[mercaptan]]s (substances containing a thiol group), [[short-chain fatty acid]]s and [[phenol]].<ref name=ChungPodolsky/>

Numerous other abnormalities have been described in hepatic encephalopathy, although their relative contribution to the disease state is uncertain. [[Benzodiazepine]]-like compounds have been detected at increased levels as well as abnormalities in the GABA neurotransmission system. An imbalance between [[aromatic amino acids]] (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine) and [[branched-chain amino acids]] (leucine, isoleucine and valine) has been described; this would lead to the generation of false [[neurotransmitter]]s (such [[octopamine]] and [[2-hydroxyphenethylamine]]). Dysregulation of the [[serotonin]] system, too, has been reported. Depletion of [[zinc]] and accumulation of [[manganese]] may play a role.<ref name=Cash/><ref name=ChungPodolsky/> Inflammation elsewhere in the body may precipitate encephalopathy through the action of [[cytokine]]s and bacterial [[lipopolysaccharide]] on astrocytes.<ref name=Sundaram/>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Alzheimer type II astrocyte high mag cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of [[Alzheimer type II astrocyte]]s, as may be seen in hepatic encephalopathy.]]

===Investigations===
The diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy can only be made in the presence of confirmed liver disease (types A and C) or a portosystemic shunt (type B), as its symptoms are similar to those encountered in other [[Encephalopathy|encephalopathies]]. To make the distinction, abnormal [[liver function tests]] and/or [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] suggesting liver disease are required, and ideally [[liver biopsy]].<ref name=Cash/><ref name=ChungPodolsky/> The symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy may also arise from other conditions, such as [[cerebral haemorrhage]] and [[seizure]]s (both of which are more common in chronic liver disease). A [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]] of the brain may be required to exclude haemorrhage, and if seizure activity is suspected an [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalograph]] (EEG) study may be performed.<ref name=Cash/> Rarer mimics of encephalopathy are [[meningitis]], [[encephalitis]], [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]] and [[Wilson's disease]]; these may be suspected on clinical grounds and confirmed with investigations.<ref name=ChungPodolsky/><ref name=Ferenci/>

The diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy is a clinical one, once other causes for confusion or coma have been excluded; no test fully diagnoses or excludes it. Serum ammonia levels are elevated in 90% of patients, but not all [[hyperammonaemia]] (high ammonia levels) is associated with encephalopathy.<ref name=Cash/><ref name=ChungPodolsky/> A CT scan of the brain usually shows no abnormality except in stage IV encephalopathy, when cerebral oedema may be visible.<ref name=ChungPodolsky/> Other [[neuroimaging]] modalities, such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), are not currently regarded as useful, although they may show abnormalities.<ref name=Ferenci/> Electroencephalography shows no clear abnormalities in stage 0, even if minimal HE is present; in stages I, II and III there are triphasic waves over the [[frontal lobe]]s that oscillate at 5&nbsp;Hz, and in stage IV there is slow [[delta wave]] activity.<ref name=Cash/> However, the changes in EEG are not typical enough to be useful in distinguishing hepatic encephalopathy from other conditions.<ref name=Ferenci/>

Once the diagnosis of encephalopathy has been made, efforts are made to exclude underlying causes (such as listed above in "[[#Causes|causes]]"). This requires [[blood test]]s (urea and electrolytes, full blood count, liver function tests), usually a [[chest X-ray]], and [[urinalysis]]. If there is ascites, diagnostic [[paracentesis]] (removal of a fluid sample with a needle) may be required to identify [[spontaneous bacterial peritonitis]] (SBP).<ref name=Cash/>

===Minimal HE===
The diagnosis of minimal hepatic encephalopathy requires neuropsychological testing by definition. Older tests include the "numbers connecting test" A and B (measuring the speed at which one could connect randomly dispersed numbers 1–20), the "block design test" and the "digit-symbol test".<ref name=Ferenci/> In 2009 an expert panel concluded that neuropsychological test batteries aimed at measuring multiple domains of cognitive function are generally more reliable than single tests, and tend to be more strongly correlated with functional status. Both the [[Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status]] (RBANS)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Randolph C, Tierney MC, Mohr E, Chase TN |title=The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS): preliminary clinical validity |journal=J Clin Exp Neuropsychol |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=310–9 |year=1998 |month=June |pmid=9845158 |doi=10.1076/jcen.20.3.310.823}}</ref> and PSE-Syndrom-Test<ref name=Weissenborn>{{cite journal |author=Weissenborn K, Ennen JC, Schomerus H, Rückert N, Hecker H |title=Neuropsychological characterization of hepatic encephalopathy |journal=J. Hepatol. |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=768–73 |year=2001 |month=May |pmid=11434627 |doi=10.1016/S0168-8278(01)00026-5 |url=http://www.jhep-elsevier.com/article/PIIS0168827801000265/fulltext}}</ref> may be used for this purpose.<ref name=Randolph/> The PSE-Syndrom-Test, developed in Germany and validated in several other European countries, incorporates older assessment tools such as the number connection test.<ref name=Ferenci/><ref name=Randolph/><ref name=Bajaj/><ref name=Weissenborn/>

==Treatment==
Those with severe encephalopathy (stages 3 and 4) are at risk of obstructing their [[airway]] due to decreased protective reflexes such as the [[gag reflex]]. This can lead to [[respiratory arrest]]. Transferring the patient to a higher level of nursing care, such as an [[intensive care unit]], is required and [[intubation]] of the airway is often necessary to prevent life-threatening complications (e.g., aspiration or respiratory failure).<ref name=ChungPodolsky/><ref name=Polson/> Placement of a [[nasogastric intubation|nasogastric tube]] permits the safe administration of nutrients and medication.<ref name=Cash/>

The treatment of hepatic encephalopathy depends on the suspected underlying cause (types A, B or C) and the presence or absence of underlying causes. If encephalopathy develops in acute liver failure (type A), even in a mild form (grade 1–2), it indicates that a liver transplant may be required, and transfer to a specialist centre is advised.<ref name=Polson>{{cite journal |author=Polson J, Lee WM |title=AASLD position paper: the management of acute liver failure |journal=Hepatology |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=1179–97 |year=2005 |month=May |pmid=15841455 |doi=10.1002/hep.20703 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/110472818/HTMLSTART}}</ref> Hepatic encephalopathy type B may arise in those who have undergone a TIPSS procedure; in most cases this resolves spontaneously or with the medical treatments discussed below, but in a small proportion of about&nbsp;5%, [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]] of the shunt is required to address the symptoms.<ref name=Sundaram/>

In hepatic encephalopathy type C, the identification and treatment of alternative or underlying causes is central to the initial management.<ref name=Cash/><ref name=ChungPodolsky/><ref name=Sundaram/><ref name=Bajaj>{{cite journal |author=Bajaj JS |title=Review article: the modern management of hepatic encephalopathy |journal=Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=537–47 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20002027 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2009.04211.x}}</ref> Given the frequency of infection as the underlying cause, antibiotics are often administered [[Empiric therapy|empirically]] (without knowledge of the exact source and nature of the infection).<ref name=Cash/><ref name=Sundaram/> Once an episode of encephalopathy has been effectively treated, a decision may need to be made on whether to prepare for a liver transplant.<ref name=Bajaj/>

===Diet===
In the past, it was thought that consumption of protein even at normal levels increased the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. This has been shown to be incorrect. Furthermore, many people with chronic liver disease are malnourished and require adequate protein to maintain a stable body weight. A diet with adequate protein and energy is therefore recommended.<ref name=Cash/><ref name=Sundaram/>

Dietary supplementation with branched-chain amino acids has shown improvement of encephalopathy and other complications of cirrhosis.<ref name=Cash/><ref name=Sundaram/> Some studies have shown benefit of administration of [[probiotic]]s ("healthy bacteria").<ref name=Sundaram/>

===Lactulose/lactitol===
[[Lactulose]] and [[lactitol]] are [[disaccharide]]s that are not absorbed from the digestive tract. They are thought to improve the generation of ammonia by bacteria, render the ammonia inabsorbable by converting it to ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub>), and increase transit of bowel content through the gut. Doses of 15-30&nbsp;ml are administered three times a day; the result is aimed to be 3–5 soft stools a day, or (in some settings) a stool [[pH]] of <6.0.<ref name=Cash/><ref name=ChungPodolsky/><ref name=Sundaram/><ref name=Bajaj/> 
Lactulose may also be given by [[enema]], especially if encephalopathy is severe.<ref name=Bajaj/> More commonly, [[sodium phosphate|phosphate]] enemas are used. This may relieve constipation, one of the causes of encephalopathy, and increase bowel transit.<ref name=Cash/>

A 2004 review by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine whether lactulose and lactitol are of benefit for hepatic encephalopathy,<ref name=Cochrane>{{cite journal |author=Als-Nielsen B, Gluud L, Gluud C |title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue= 2|pages=CD003044 |year= 2004|pmid=15106187 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003044.pub2 |url=http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003044.html |chapter=Nonabsorbable disaccharides for hepatic encephalopathy |editor1-last=Als-Nielsen |editor1-first=Bodil}}</ref> but it remains the first-line treatment for type C hepatic encephalopathy.<ref name=Cash/> In acute liver failure, it is unclear whether lactulose is beneficial. Furthermore, it may lead to [[bloating]] and as such interfere with a liver transplant procedure if required.<ref name=Polson/>

===Antibiotics===
The antibiotics [[neomycin]] and [[metronidazole]] were previously used as a treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. Again, the rationale of their use was the fact that ammonia and other waste products are generated and converted by intestinal bacteria, and killing of these bacteria would reduce the generation of these waste products. Neomycin was chosen because of its [[bioavailability|low intestinal absorption]], as neomycin and similar [[aminoglycoside]] antibiotics may cause [[hearing loss]] and [[renal failure]] if used extensively. Later studies showed that neomycin was indeed absorbed enterally, with resultant complications. Metronidazole, similarly, was abandoned because prolonged use could cause a [[peripheral neuropathy]] (nerve damage), and many experience gastrointestinal side effects.<ref name=Cash/>

A safer and probably more effective antibiotic is [[rifaximin]], a nonabsorbable antibiotic from the [[rifamycin]] class. This is thought to work in a similar way, but without the complications attached to neomycin and metronidazole. The use of rifaximin is supported by better [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence]] than lactulose.<ref name=Cochrane/> Due to more widespread experience, it is only used as a second-line treatment if lactulose is not effective or poorly tolerated. When added to lactulose, the combination of the two may be more effective than each component separately.<ref name=Cash/> Rifaximin is more expensive than lactulose, but the cost may be offset by reduced hospital admissions for encephalopathy.<ref name=Bajaj/>

===LOLA===
A preparation of [[ornithine|''L''-ornithine]] and [[aspartic acid|''L''-aspartate]] (LOLA) is used to increase the generation of [[urea]] through the [[urea cycle]], a [[metabolic pathway]] that removes ammonia by turning it into the neutral substance [[urea]]. It may be combined with lactulose and/or rifaximin if these alone are ineffective at controlling symptoms.<ref name=Cash/>

==Epidemiology and prognosis==
In those with cirrhosis, the risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy is 20% per year, and at any time about 30–45% of people with cirrhosis exhibit evidence of overt encephalopathy. The prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy detectable on formal neuropsychological testing is 60–80%; this increases the likelihood of developing overt encephalopathy in the future.<ref name=Bajaj/> Once hepatic encephalopathy has developed, the [[prognosis]] is determined largely by other markers of liver failure, such as the levels of [[albumin]] (a protein produced by the liver), the [[prothrombin time]] (a test of [[coagulation]], which relies on proteins produced in the liver), the presence of [[ascites]] and the level of [[bilirubin]] (a breakdown product of [[hemoglobin]] which is conjugated and excreted by the liver). Together with the severity of encephalopathy, these markers have been incorporated into the [[Child-Pugh score]]; this score determines the one- and two-year survival and may assist in a decision to offer liver transplantation.<ref name=Ferenci/>

In acute liver failure, the development of severe encephalopathy strongly predicts short-term mortality, and is almost as important as the nature of the underlying cause of the liver failure in determining the prognosis. Historically, widely used criteria for offering liver transplantation, such as [[King's College Criteria]], are of limited use and recent guidelines discourage excessive reliance on these criteria. The occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with Wilson's disease (hereditary copper accumulation) and mushroom poisoning indicates an urgent need for a liver transplant.<ref name=Polson/>

==History==
The occurrence of disturbed behaviour in people with jaundice may have been described in antiquity by [[Hippocrates|Hippocrates of Cos]] (ca. 460–370&nbsp;BCE).<ref name=Weissenborn/><ref name=Summerskill>{{cite journal |author=Summerskill WH, Davidson EA, Sherlock S, Steiner RE |title=The neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with hepatic cirrhosis and an extensive portal collateral circulation |journal=Q. J. Med. |volume=25 |issue=98 |pages=245–66 |year=1956 |month=April |pmid=13323252}}</ref> [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]] and [[Galen]] (first and third century respectively) both recognised the condition. Many modern descriptions of the link between liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms were made in the eighteenth and nineteenth century; for instance, [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni]] (1682–1771) reported in 1761 that it was a progressive condition.<ref name=Summerskill/>

In the 1950s, several reports enumerated the numerous abnormalities reported previously, and confirmed the previously enunciated theory that metabolic impairment and portosystemic shunting are the underlying mechanism behind hepatic encephalopathy, and that the nitrogen-rich compounds originate from the intestine.<ref name=Weissenborn/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sherlock S, Summerskill WH, White LP, Phear EA |title=Portal-systemic encephalopathy; neurological complications of liver disease |journal=Lancet |volume=264 |issue=6836 |pages=453–7 |year=1954 |month=September |pmid=13193045 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(54)91874-7}}</ref> Many of these studies were done by Professor Dame [[Sheila Sherlock]] (1918–2001), then at the [[Royal Postgraduate Medical School]] in [[London]] and subsequently at the [[Royal Free Hospital]]. The same group investigated protein restriction<ref name=Summerskill/> and neomycin.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM196002252620803 |author=Last PM, Sherlock S |title=Systemic absorption of orally administered neomycin in liver disease |journal=N.

The [[West Haven, Connecticut|West Haven]] classification was formulated by Prof Harold Conn and colleagues at [[Yale University]] while investigating the therapeutic efficacy of lactulose.<ref name=Ferenci/><ref name=Conn/>
