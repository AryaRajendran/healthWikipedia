'''Altitude sickness'''—also known as '''acute mountain sickness''' ('''AMS'''), '''altitude illness''', '''hypobaropathy''', '''"the altitude bends"''', or '''soroche'''—is a pathological [[effects of high altitude on humans|effect of high altitude on humans]], caused by acute exposure to low [[Breathing gas#Partial pressure of oxygen|partial pressure of oxygen]] at [[high altitude]]. It commonly occurs above 2,400&nbsp;metres (8,000&nbsp;feet).<ref>{{Cite web

It presents as a collection of [[nonspecific symptoms]], acquired at high altitude or in low air pressure, resembling a case of "flu, carbon monoxide poisoning, or a hangover".<ref>The Mountaineers. Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills, 7th Edition. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2003</ref> It is hard to determine who will be affected by altitude sickness, as there are no specific factors that correlate with a susceptibility to altitude sickness. However, most people can ascend to 2,400&nbsp;metres (8,000&nbsp;ft) without difficulty.

Acute mountain sickness can progress to [[high altitude pulmonary edema]] (HAPE) or [[high altitude cerebral edema]] (HACE), which are potentially fatal.<ref name=Borden/><ref name=Thompson>{{Cite web

[[Chronic mountain sickness]], also known as ''Monge's disease'', is a different condition that only occurs after very prolonged exposure to high altitude.<ref>A.J. Giannini, H.R. Black, R.L.

However, it is the air density itself, the number of molecules (of both oxygen and nitrogen) per given volume, which drops as altitude increases. Consequently, the available amount of oxygen to sustain mental and physical alertness decreases with altitude.

The rate of ascent, altitude attained, amount of physical activity at high altitude, as well as individual susceptibility, are contributing factors to the onset and severity of high-altitude illness.

Altitude sickness usually occurs following a rapid ascent and can usually be prevented by ascending slowly.<ref name=Thompson/> In most of these cases, the symptoms are temporary and usually abate as altitude acclimatisation occurs. However, in extreme cases, altitude sickness can be fatal.

==Definitions==
*High altitude: {{convert|1500|to|3500|m|ft}} - The onset of physiological effects of diminished inspiratory oxygen pressure (PiO<sub>2</sub>) includes decreased exercise performance and increased ventilation (lower arterial PCO<sub>2</sub>). Minor impairment exists in arterial oxygen transport (arterial oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) at least 90%), but arterial PO<sub>2</sub> is significantly diminished. Because of the large number of people who ascend rapidly to altitudes between 2,400 and 4,000 m, high-altitude illness is common in this range.<ref>{{cite book

*Very high altitude: {{convert|3500|to|5500|m|ft}} - Maximum SaO<sub>2</sub> falls below 90% as the arterial PO<sub>2</sub> falls below 60mmHg. Extreme hypoxemia may occur during exercise, during sleep, and in the presence of high altitude pulmonary edema or other acute lung conditions. Severe altitude illness occurs most commonly in this range.<ref name="Auerbach 2007">[[#Auer07|Auerbach 2007]]</ref>

*Extreme altitude: above {{convert|5500|m|ft}} - Marked hypoxemia, [[hypocapnia]], and alkalosis are characteristic of extreme altitudes. Progressive deterioration of physiologic function eventually outstrips acclimatization. As a result, no permanent human habitation occurs above 6,000 m. A period of acclimatization is necessary when ascending to extreme altitude; abrupt ascent without supplemental oxygen for other than brief exposures invites severe altitude sickness.<ref name="Auerbach 2007"/>

==Signs and symptoms==

People have different susceptibilities to altitude sickness; for some otherwise healthy people, acute altitude sickness can begin to appear at around 2000 meters (6,500&nbsp;ft) above sea level, such as at many mountain ski resorts, equivalent to a pressure of 80 [[kPa]].<ref>{{Cite web| author=K. Baillie and A. Simpson | title=Acute mountain sickness| url=http://www.altitude.org/high_altitude.php | publisher=Apex (Altitude Physiology Expeditions) | accessdate=2007-08-08}}&nbsp;— High altitude information for laypeople</ref> This is the most frequent type of altitude sickness encountered. Symptoms often manifest themselves six to ten hours after ascent and generally subside in one to two days, but they occasionally develop into the more serious conditions. Symptoms include headache, fatigue, stomach illness, dizziness, and sleep disturbance.<ref name=Thompson/> Exertion aggravates the symptoms.

The Lake Louise assessment system of AMS is based on a self-report questionnaire as well as a quick clinical assessment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Savourey |first1=G |last2=Guinet |first2=A, |last3=Besnard |first3=Y |last4=Garcia |first4=N |last5=Hanniquet |first5=AM |last6=Bittel |first6=J |date=October 1995 |title=Evaluation of the Lake Louise acute mountain sickness scoring system in a hypobaric chamber |journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine |publisher=Aerospace Medical Association |location=Alexandria, VA |volume=66 |issue=10 |pages=963–7 |pmid=8526833 }}</ref>

Those individuals with the lowest initial partial pressure of end-tidal pCO<sub>2</sub> (the lowest concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] at the end of the respiratory cycle, a measure of a higher alveolar ventilation) and corresponding high oxygen saturation levels tend to have a lower incidence of acute mountain sickness than those with high end-tidal pCO<sub>2</sub> and low oxygen saturation levels.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Douglas|first=Danielle|coauthors=Robert Schoene|title=End-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide and acute mountain sickness in the first 24 hours upon ascent to cusco, peru (3326 meters)|journal=Wilderness and Environment Medicine|year=2010|volume=21|pages=109–113|doi=10.1016/j.wem.2010.01.003|issue=2}}</ref>

===Primary symptoms===
[[Headache]]s are the primary symptom used to diagnose altitude sickness, although a headache is also a symptom of [[dehydration]]. A headache occurring at an altitude above 2,400 metres (8,000 feet = 76 [[kPa]]), combined with any one or more of the following symptoms, may indicate altitude sickness:
* Lack of appetite, [[nausea]], or vomiting
* [[Fatigue (physical)|Fatigue]] or weakness
* [[Dizziness]] or [[lightheadedness]]
* [[Insomnia]]
* [[Paraesthesia|Pins and needles]]
* Shortness of breath upon exertion
* Nosebleed
* Persistent rapid pulse
* Drowsiness
* General [[malaise]]
* [[Peripheral oedema]] (swelling of hands, feet, and face).

===Severe symptoms===
Symptoms that may indicate life-threatening altitude sickness include:
; [[Pulmonary edema]] (fluid in the lungs):
:* Symptoms similar to [[bronchitis]]
:* Persistent dry cough
:* Fever
:* Shortness of breath even when resting

;[[Cerebral edema]] (swelling of the brain):
:* Headache that does not respond to analgesics
:* Unsteady gait
:* Gradual loss of consciousness
:* Increased nausea
:* Retinal hemorrhage

The most serious symptoms of altitude sickness arise from [[edema]] (fluid accumulation in the tissues of the body). At very high altitude, humans can get either [[high altitude pulmonary edema]] (HAPE), or [[high altitude cerebral edema]] (HACE). The physiological cause of altitude-induced edema is not conclusively established. It is currently believed, however, that HACE is caused by local vasodilation of cerebral blood vessels in response to hypoxia, resulting in greater blood flow and, consequently, greater capillary pressures. On the other hand, HAPE may be due to general vasoconstriction in the pulmonary circulation (normally a response to regional ventilation-perfusion mismatches) which, with constant or increased cardiac output, also leads to increases in capillary pressures. For those suffering HACE, [[dexamethasone]] may provide temporary relief from symptoms in order to keep descending under their own power.

HAPE can progress rapidly and is often fatal. Symptoms include fatigue, severe [[dyspnea]] at rest, and cough that is initially dry but may progress to produce pink, frothy [[sputum]]. Descent to lower altitudes alleviates the symptoms of HAPE.

HACE is a life threatening condition that can lead to coma or death.  Symptoms include headache, fatigue, visual impairment, bladder dysfunction, bowel dysfunction, loss of coordination, paralysis on one side of the body, and confusion. Descent to lower altitudes may save those afflicted with HACE.

==Prevention==
Ascending slowly is the best way to avoid altitude sickness.<ref name=Thompson/> Avoiding strenuous activity such as skiing, hiking, etc. in the first 24 hours at high altitude reduces the symptoms of AMS. As alcohol tends to cause dehydration, which exacerbates AMS, avoiding alcohol consumption in the first 24-hours at a higher altitude is optimal.

===Altitude acclimatization===<!-- This section is linked from [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] -->
Altitude acclimatization is the process of adjusting to decreasing [[oxygen]] levels at higher elevations, in order to avoid altitude sickness.<ref name=Acclimatization>{{Cite journal|author=Muza, S.R.; Fulco, C.S.; Cymerman, A. |title=Altitude Acclimatization Guide |journal=U.S. Army Research Inst. of Environmental Medicine Thermal and Mountain Medicine Division Technical Report |issue=USARIEM–TN–04–05 |year=2004 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7616 |accessdate=2009-03-05 }}</ref> Once above approximately 3,000&nbsp;metres (10,000&nbsp;feet = 70&nbsp;kPa), most climbers and high-altitude trekkers take the "climb-high, sleep-low" approach. For high-altitude climbers, a typical acclimatization regimen might be to stay a few days at a [[base camp]], climb up to a higher camp (slowly), and then return to base camp. A subsequent climb to the higher camp then includes an overnight stay. This process is then repeated a few times, each time extending the time spent at higher altitudes to let the body adjust to the oxygen level there, a process that involves the production of additional [[red blood cells]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Once the climber has acclimatised to a given altitude, the process is repeated with camps placed at progressively higher elevations. The general rule of thumb is to not ascend more than 300&nbsp;metres (1,000&nbsp;ft) per day to sleep. That is, one can climb from 3,000 (10,000&nbsp;feet = 70&nbsp;kPa) to 4,500&nbsp;metres (15,000&nbsp;feet = 58 kPa) in one day, but one should then descend back to 3,300&nbsp;metres (11,000&nbsp;feet = 67.5&nbsp;kPa) to sleep. This process cannot safely be rushed, and this is why climbers need to spend days (or even weeks at times) acclimatising before attempting to climb a high peak. Simulated altitude equipment that produces hypoxic (reduced oxygen) air can be used to acclimate to high altitude, reducing the total time required on the mountain itself.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Altitude acclimatization is necessary for some people who move rapidly from lower altitudes to intermediate altitudes (e.g., by aircraft and ground transportation over a few hours), such as from sea level to {{convert|8000|ft|m}} as in many Colorado, USA mountain resorts. Stopping at an intermediate altitude overnight can alleviate or eliminate occurrences of AMS.

===Medical treatment===
The drug [[acetazolamide]] may help some people making a rapid ascent to sleeping altitude above {{convert|2700|m|ft|sigfig=1}}, and it may also be effective if started early in the course of AMS.<ref>{{Cite book|author=World Health Organization |title=International travel and health |chapter=CHAPTER 3 Environmental health risks |chapterurl=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241580397_3_eng.pdf |format=PDF |page=31 |date=1 January 2007 |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref> Acetazolamide should be taken before symptoms appear — this is a preventative measure. The [[Everest Base Camp]] Medical Centre cautions against its routine use as a substitute for a reasonable ascent schedule, except where rapid ascent is forced by flying into high altitude locations or due to terrain considerations.<ref name="BaseCampMD_prophylaxis">{{Cite web|author=Himalayan Rescue Association - Everest Medicial Clinic |title=Prophylaxis |url=http://www.basecampmd.com/expguide/amspremed.shtml |date= |publisher=ExplorersWeb |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref> The Centre suggests a dosage of 125–250&nbsp;mg twice daily for prophylaxis, starting from 24&nbsp;hours before ascending until a few days at the highest altitude or on descending;<ref name="BaseCampMD_prophylaxis"/> with 250&nbsp;mg twice daily recommended for treatment of AMS.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Himalayan Rescue Association - Everest Medicial Clinic |title=Treating AMS |url=http://www.basecampmd.com/expguide/diamox.shtml |date= |publisher=ExplorersWeb |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref> The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] suggest a lower dose for prevention of 125&nbsp;mg acetazolamide every 12 hours.<ref name="CDC_Yellow Book">{{Cite book| title=CDC Health Information for International Travel 2010 "The Yellow Book" |editor=Turell D, Brunette G, Kozarsky P, Lefor A |chapter=Chapter 2 The Pre-Travel Consultation - Self-Treatable Diseases - Altitude Illness |author=Hackett P, Shlim D |chapterurl=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2010/chapter-2/altitude-illness.aspx |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=0-7020-3481-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref> An undesirable side-effect of acetazolamide is a reduction in aerobic endurance performance.

A promising possible preventative treatment for altitude sickness is myo-inositol trispyrophosphate (ITPP), which increases the amount of oxygen released by hemoglobin.  Following the onset of altitude sickness, [[ibuprofen]] is a suggested anti-inflammatory and painkiller that can help alleviate both the headache and nausea associated with AMS, as well as in combating [[cerebral edema]] (swelling of the brain) associated with extreme symptoms of AMS.<ref>{{Cite web| url= http://med.stanford.edu/ism/2012/march/altitude.html | title= Ibuprofen decreases likelihood of altitude sickness, researchers find | author= John Sanford | year= 2012 | month= March | accessdate= 2012-09-19}}</ref>

For centuries, [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] such as the [[Aymaras]] of the [[Altiplano]], have chewed [[coca]] leaves to try to alleviate the symptoms of mild altitude sickness. In Chinese and Tibetan traditional medicine, extract of root tissue of ''[[Rhodiola_rosea|Radix rhodiola]]'' is often taken in order to prevent the same symptoms.

===Oxygen enrichment===
In high-altitude conditions, oxygen enrichment can counteract the [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] related effects of altitude sickness. A small amount of supplemental oxygen reduces the equivalent altitude in climate-controlled rooms. At 3,400&nbsp;meters (11,155&nbsp;feet = 67&nbsp;kPa), raising the oxygen concentration level by 5&nbsp;percent via an [[oxygen concentrator]] and an existing ventilation system provides an effective altitude of 
3,000&nbsp;metres (10,000&nbsp;feet = 70&nbsp;kPa), which is more tolerable for surface-dwellers.<ref name="pmid7777705">{{Cite journal| author = West JB | title = Oxygen enrichment of room air to relieve the hypoxia of high altitude | journal = Respir Physiol | volume = 99 | issue = 2 | pages = 225–232 | year = 1995 | month = February | pmid = 7777705 | doi = 10.1016/0034-5687(94)00094-G| url = | issn = }}</ref>

===Other methods===
Increased water intake may also help in acclimatisation<ref name="dannen">{{Cite book

 | quote = Visitors unaccustomed to high elevations may experience symptoms of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)[...s]uggestions for alleviating symptoms include drinking plenty of water[.]}}</ref> to replace the fluids lost through heavier breathing in the thin, dry air found at altitude, although consuming excessive quantities ("over-hydration") has no benefits and may cause dangerous [[hyponatremia]].  It’s a good idea to limit alcohol intake the first day or so at higher elevation as well.

Oxygen from gas bottles or liquid containers can be applied directly via a nasal cannula or mask. Oxygen concentrators based upon [[pressure swing adsorption]] (PSA), VSA, or vacuum-pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) can be used to generate the oxygen if electricity is available.  Stationary oxygen concentrators typically use PSA technology, which has performance degradations at the lower barometric pressures at high altitudes. One way to compensate for the performance degradation is to utilize a concentrator with more flow capacity. There are also portable oxygen concentrators that can be used on vehicular DC power or on internal batteries, and at least one system commercially available measures and compensates for the altitude effect on its performance up to 4,000&nbsp;meters (13,000&nbsp;ft). The application of high-purity oxygen from one of these methods increases the partial pressure of oxygen by raising the [[FIO2|FiO<sub>2</sub>]] (fraction of inspired oxygen).

Also, the use of Nitric Oxide has been proven to address and relieve altitude sickness. 12 scientists recently released a study in which Mount Everest trekkers were allowed to naturally adapt to altitude during their ascent.  They were tested for nitric oxide levels along the way.  The scientists found that their bodies naturally produced more nitric oxide as they climbed higher.  "Our results suggest that nitric oxide is an integral part of the human physiological response to hypoxia."

== Treatment ==
The only reliable treatment and in many cases the only option available is to descend. Attempts to treat or stabilise the patient ''in situ'' at altitude is dangerous unless highly controlled and with good medical facilities. However, the following treatments have been used when the patient's location and circumstances permit:
* Oxygen may be used for mild to moderate AMS below {{convert|12000|ft|m}} and is commonly provided by physicians at mountain resorts. Symptoms abate in 12–36 hours without the need to descend.
* For more serious cases of AMS, or where rapid descent is impractical, a [[Gamow bag]], a portable plastic [[hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric chamber]] inflated with a foot pump, can be used to reduce the effective altitude by as much as 1,500 meters (5,000&nbsp;ft). A Gamow bag is generally used only as an aid to evacuate severe AMS patients, not to treat them at altitude.
* [[Acetazolamide]] may assist in altitude acclimatization.<ref name="pmid5916650">{{Cite journal| author = Cain SM, Dunn JE | title = Low doses of acetazolamide to aid accommodation  of men to altitude | journal = J Appl Physiol | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 1195–200 | year = 1966 | month = July | pmid = 5916650}}</ref>
* A study by the Denali Medical Research Project concluded: "In established cases of acute mountain sickness, treatment with acetazolamide relieves symptoms, improves arterial oxygenation, and prevents further impairment of pulmonary gas exchange."<ref name="pmid1739236">{{Cite journal| author = Grissom CK, Roach RC, Sarnquist FH, Hackett PH | title = Acetazolamide in the treatment of acute mountain sickness: clinical efficacy and effect on gas exchange | journal = Ann.

* The folk remedy for altitude sickness in [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] is a tea made from the coca plant. See [[Coca tea|mate de coca]].
* Other treatments include injectable [[steroids]] to reduce pulmonary edema, this may buy time to descend but treats a symptom, it does not treat the underlying AMS.
* Two recent studies showed that Ibuprofen 600 milligrams three times daily was effective at preventing AMS.  But it was not clear if this affected HAPE or HACE. <ref>{{cite journal|last=lipman|first=Grant|coauthors=Nicholas Kanaan, Peter Holck, Benjamin Constance, Jeffrey Gertssch|title=Ibuprofen Prevents Altitude Illness: A Randomized Controlled Trial for Prevention of Altitude Illness With Non-steroidal Anit-inflammatories|journal=The Annals of Emergency Medicine|year=2012|month=June|volume=59|issue=6|pages=484-490}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal|last=Gertsch|first=Jeffrey|coauthors=et al.|title=Altitude Sickness in Climbers and Efficacy of NSAIDs Trial (ASCENT): Randomized, Controlled Trial of Ibuprofen Versus Placebo for Prevention of Altitude Illness.|journal=Wilderness and Environmental Medicine|year=2012|volume=23|issue=2|pages=307-315}}</ref>
