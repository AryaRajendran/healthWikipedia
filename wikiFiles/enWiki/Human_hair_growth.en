{{Human hair}}

'''Human hair grows'''  everywhere on the body except for the  [[soles of the feet]] and the palms of the hands, the [[lip (mouth)|lip]]s, and the [[eyelids]], apart from [[eyelashes]]. Like skin, hair is a [[Stratified squamous epithelium|stratified squamous]], [[keratinized]] epithelium made of multi-layered, flat cells with overlying [[keratin]] (a protein), whose rope-like [[Protein filament|filament]]s provide structure and strength to the hair shaft.

Hair follows a specific growth cycle with three distinct and concurrent phases: [[anagen]], [[catagen]], and [[telogen]] phases. Each phase has specific characteristics that determine the length of the hair. All three phases occur simultaneously; one strand of hair may be in the anagen phase, while another is in the telogen phase.

The body has different types of hair, including [[vellus hair]] and [[androgenic hair]], each with its own type of cellular construction.  The different construction gives the hair unique characteristics, serving specific purposes, mainly warmth and protection.

==Growth cycle==
The three stages of hair growth are the [[Hair follicle#Hair-follicle cycling|anagen]], [[Hair follicle#Hair-follicle cycling|catagen]], and [[Hair follicle#Hair-follicle cycling|telogen]] phases. Each strand of hair on the human body is at its own stage of development. Once the cycle is complete, it restarts and a new strand of hair begins to form. The rate or speed of hair growth is about 1.25&nbsp;centimeters or 0.5&nbsp;inches per month, or about 15 centimeters or 6&nbsp;inches per year.

===Anagen phase===
The anagen phase is known as the growth phase. It begins in the [[Hair follicle|papilla]] and can last from two to six years.<ref name=TCP>{{cite book|title=Textbook of clinical pediatrics|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=9783642022012|url=http://books.google.co.za/books?id=FEf4EMjYSrgC&pg=PA1489|edition=2. ed.|editor=A.

The longer the hair stays in the anagen phase, the faster and longer it will grow. During this phase, the cells in the papilla divide to produce new hair fibers, and the follicle buries itself into the [[dermal]] layer of the skin to nourish the strand. About 85% of the hairs on one's head are in the anagen phase at any given time.

===Catagen phase===
Signals sent out by the body determine when the anagen phase ends and the catagen phase begins. The catagen phase, also known as the transitional phase, allows the follicle to, in a sense, renew itself. During this time, which lasts about two weeks, the hair follicle shrinks due to disintegration and the papilla detaches and "rests," cutting the hair strand off from its nourishing blood supply.  Ultimately, the follicle is 1/6 its original length, causing the hair shaft to be pushed upward. While hair is not growing during this phase, the length of the terminal fibers increase when the follicle pushes them upward.

===Telogen phase===
During the telogen, or resting, phase the hair and follicle remain dormant anywhere from 1â€“4 months. Ten to fifteen percent of the hairs on one's head are in this phase of growth in any given time. The anagen phase begins again once the telogen phase is complete. The preceding hair strand is pushed up and out by the new, growing strand. The process causes the normal hair loss known as [[Moult|shedding]].

==Growth inhibitors and disorders==
===Chemotherapy===

Most [[chemotherapy]] drugs work by attacking fast-[[Cell division|replicating]] cells. Rapid cell replication is one of the hallmarks of cancer; however, hair follicle cells also grow and divide quickly. Consequently, the chemotherapy drugs usually inhibit hair growth.  The dose and type of medicine determine the severity of hair loss, but once the chemotherapy has ended, new hair growth may begin after three to 10 months.

===Alopecia-related syndromes===
[[Alopecia]] is a hair loss disease that can occur in anyone at any stage of life.  Specifically [[Alopecia areata]] is an [[autoimmune disease]] that causes hair to spontaneously fall out. It is mainly characterized by bald patches on the scalp or other parts of the body, and can ultimately cause baldness across the entire body. This disease interferes with the hair growth cycle by causing a follicle to prematurely leave the [[anagen]], or active growth, phase and enter the resting, or [[telogen]] phase.  The hair growth in the affected follicles is lessened or stopped completely.

[[Traction alopecia]] is caused by adding too much strain on the hair on one's head.  Tight ponytails and other styles that require added tension to the hair are often what cause this disease.  It can also occur on the face in areas where the hair is often styled. Plucking or waxing one's eyebrows frequently, for example, can yield suppressed hair growth in the area.

On the scalp, the hair is usually known to be lost around the hair line, leaving the densest amount of hair at the crown. Small [[vellus hair]] will often replace the hair that is lost. In most people, scalp hair growth will halt due to follicle devitalization after reaching a length of generally two or three feet. Exceptions to this rule can be observed in individuals with hair development abnormalities, which may cause an unusual length of hair growth.
