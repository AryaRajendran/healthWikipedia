:''This page refers to the veins that drain deoxygenated blood from the liver. For the vein that drains nutrient-rich blood from the GI tract and the spleen into the liver, see [[hepatic portal vein]].''

In [[human anatomy]], the '''hepatic veins''' are the [[blood vessel]]s that drain de-oxygenated [[blood]] from the [[liver]] and blood cleaned by the liver (from the [[stomach]], [[pancreas]], [[small intestine]] and [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]) into the [[inferior vena cava]].  

They arise from the substance of the liver, more specifically the [[central veins of liver|central vein]] of the [[liver lobule]].
None of the hepatic veins have valves.

==Groups==
They can be differentiated into two groups, the ''upper group'' and ''lower group''.  

* The upper group typically arises from the posterior aspect of the liver, are three in number, and drain the [[quadrate lobe]] and [[left lobe]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}  
* The lower group arise from the [[right lobe]] and [[caudate lobe]], are variable in number, and are typically smaller than those in the upper group.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Pathology==
Occlusion of the hepatic [[vein]]s is known as [[Budd-Chiari syndrome]].
