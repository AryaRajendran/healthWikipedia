'''Fibrocystic breast''' or '''fibrocystic breast disease''' is a condition of [[breast]] tissue affecting an estimated 30-60% of women and at least 50% of women of childbearing age.<ref>{{cite journal| authorlink = | title = Fibrocystic Breast Disease An Update and Review | journal = JOGNN – Journal of Obstetric Gynecologic, & Neonatal Nursing | volume = 19 | pages = 116–121 | date = March 1990}}</ref> It is characterized by noncancerous [[breast lump]]s in the breast which can sometimes cause discomfort, often periodically related to [[hormone|hormonal]] influences from the [[menstrual cycle]].<ref>{{cite web | last=University of Maryland Medical Center | title=Fibrocystic Breast Disease - Overview | url=http://www.umm.edu/ency/article/000912.htm| accessdate = 21 June 2012}}</ref>

==Terminology==
In [[ICD-10]] the condition is called ''diffuse cystic mastopathy'', or, if there is epithelial proliferation, ''fibrosclerosis of breast''.<ref>[http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/ Disorders of breast (N60-N64)] in [[ICD-10]].</ref> Other names for this condition include ''chronic cystic mastitis'', ''fibrocystic mastopathy''  and ''mammary dysplasia''.<ref>{{cite web | last=Atlantic Women’s Specialists | title=Fibrocystic Breast Changes | url=http://www.awsphysicians.com/health-topics/article/6/Fibrocystic-Breast-Changes.php| accessdate = 21 June 2012}}</ref> The condition has also been named after several people (see [[eponym]]s below). Since it is a very common disorder, some authors have argued that it should not be termed a "disease",<ref name="pmid16034013">{{cite journal |author=Santen RJ, Mansel R |title=Benign breast disorders |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=353 |issue=3 |pages=275–85 |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=16034013 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra035692 |url=}}</ref> whereas others feel that it meets the criteria for a disease. It is not a classic form of [[mastitis]] (breast inflammation).<ref>{{cite journal| authorlink = | title=Ultrasound Characterization of Breast Masses| journal= Indian Journal of Radiology and Imaging | volume = 19 | pages=242–247 | date=August 2009}}</ref>

==Symptoms==

The changes in fibrocystic breast disease are characterised by the appearance of [[fibrous]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] and a lumpy, [[cobblestone]] texture in the breasts. These lumps are smooth with defined edges, and are usually free-moving in regard to adjacent structures. The bumps can sometimes be obscured by irregularities in the breast that are associated with the condition. The lumps are most often found in the upper, outer sections of the breast (nearest to the [[armpit]]). Women with fibrocystic changes may experience a persistent or intermittent breast aching or [[breast tenderness]] related to periodic swelling.  Breasts and [[nipples]] may be tender or [[Itch|itchy]].

Symptoms follow a periodic trend tied closely to the [[menstrual cycle]]. Symptoms tend to peak immediately before each [[Menstruation|period]] and decrease afterwards. At peak, breasts may feel full and swollen. No complications related to [[breastfeeding]] have been found.

==Causes==
The causes of the condition are not fully understood, though it is known that they are tied to [[hormone]] levels, as the condition usually subsides after [[menopause]] and is also related to the menstrual cycle.

Fibrocystic breast changes is a cumulative process, caused partly by the normal hormonal variation during a woman's monthly cycle. The most important of these hormones are [[estrogen]], [[progesterone]] and [[prolactin]]. 

These hormones directly affect the breast tissues by causing cells to grow and multiply.<ref name="Medicine Net">{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/fibrocystic_breast_condition/page2.htm#13whatcauses |title=Fibrocystic Breast Condition}}2010/04/13</ref> Many other hormones such as [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]], [[insulin]], [[growth hormone]] and growth factors such as [[TGF-beta]] exert direct and indirect effects amplifying or regulating cell growth. Years of such fluctuations eventually produce small [[breast cyst|cysts]] and/or areas of dense or fibrotic tissue. Multiple small cysts and an increasing level of breast pain commonly develop when a woman hits her 30s. Larger cysts usually do not occur until after the age of 35.<ref name="USA Today">{{cite web|url=http://www.healthscout.com/ency/68/167/main.html#CausesandRiskFactorsofFibrocysticBreastDisease |title=Fibrocystic Breast Condition}}2010/04/13</ref> Over time, presumably driven by aberrant growth signals, such lesions may accumulate epigenetic, genetic and karyotypic changes such as modified expression of hormone receptors and loss of heterozygosity.

Several variants of fibrocystic breast changes may be distinguished and these may have different causes and genetic predispostions. Adenosis involves abnormal count and density of lobular units, while other lesions appear to stem mainly from ductal epithelial origins.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is mostly done based on symptoms after exclusion of breast cancer. Nipple fluid aspiration can be used to classify cyst type (and to some extent improve breast cancer risk prediction) but it is rarely used in practice. [[Biopsy]] or fine needle aspiration are rarely warranted<ref>{{cite journal| authorlink = | title=Benign Breast Disease: When  To Treat, When To Reassure, When To Refer | journal=Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine | volume=69 | pages=424–439 | date=May 2002}}</ref>

==Tests==
Fibrocystic breast disease is primarily diagnosed based on the symptoms, clinical [[breast exam]] and on a physical exam. During this examination, the doctor checks for unusual areas in the breasts, both visually and manually. Also, the [[lymph nodes]] in the axilla area and lower neck are examined. A complete and accurate [[medical history]] is also helpful in diagnosing this condition. If the patient's medical history and physical exam findings are consistent with normal breast changes, no additional tests are considered but otherwise the patient will be asked to return a few weeks later for reassessment.<ref name="Fibrocystic breasts">{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fibrocystic-breasts/DS01070/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis |title=Tests and diagnosis}}2010/04/13</ref> Women may detect lumps in their breasts during self-examination as well.

In order to establish whether the lump is a cyst or not, several imaging tests may be performed. [[Mammography]] is usually the first imaging test to be ordered when unusual breast changes have been detected during a physical examination. A diagnostic mammography consists in a series of [[x-rays]] that provide clear images of specific areas of the breast. Mammographies are recommended in women over 30 years old even though there are no suspicious findings during the physical examination.

[[Ultrasounds]] are commonly performed in conjunction with mammographies as they produce clear images of the breast and clearly distinguish between fluid-filled breast cysts and solid masses. The ultrasound exam can better evaluate dense tissue of the breast; hence it is often undergone by young patients, under 30 years old.

The breast [[biopsy]] is usually the test used to confirm the suspected diagnosing. After imaging tests have been performed and have revealed unusual areas or lumps in the breast, a breast biopsy will be ordered. This test consists in removing a sample of breast tissue which is then looked at under a [[microscope]]. The specialist analyzing the tissue sample will be able to conclude if the breast changes are benign or malignant or whether breast fibrocystic disease is present.

There are four main types of breast biopsies that may be performed. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy is usually ordered when the doctor is almost certain that the lump is a cyst.<ref name="Health Concerns">{{cite web|url=http://www.lef.org/protocols/prtcl-145a.shtml#diag |title=Diagnosing Fibrocystic Breast Disease}}2010/04/13</ref> This test is generally performed in conjunction with an ultrasound which is helpful in guiding the needle into a small or hard to find lump. The procedure is painless and it consists in inserting a thin needle into the breast tissue while the lump is palpated.

The core-needle biopsy is normally performed under local [[anesthesia]] and in a physician's office. The needle used in this procedure is slightly larger than the one used for a fine-needle biopsy because the procedure is intended to remove a small cylinder of tissue that will be sent to the [[laboratory]] for further examination.

A newer type of breast biopsy is the [[stereotactic]] biopsy that relies on a three-dimensional x-ray to guide the needle biopsy of non-palpable mass. The biopsy is performed in a similar matter, by using a needle to remove tissue sample but locating the specific area of the breast is done by x-raying the breast by two different angles.

Surgical biopsy is a procedure performed to remove the entire lump or a part of it for laboratory analyzing. It may be painful and it is done under local anesthesia.

==Treatment==

Most women with fibrocystic changes and no symptoms do not need treatment, but closer follow-up may be advised.<ref name="Cancer Org">{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_6X_Non_Cancerous_Breast_Conditions_59.asp#Types_of_non-cancerous_breast_conditions |title=Types of non-cancerous breast conditions }}2010/04/13</ref> 

There is no widely accepted treatment or prevention strategy for fibrocystic condition. When treatment of symptoms is necessary it follows the same strategies as treatment for [[mastodynia|cyclical breast pain]].

Usually treated by [[Progesterone]] ointments and supplements

==Prognosis==
There are usually no adverse side effects to this condition. In almost all cases it subsides after [[menopause]]. A possible complication arises through the fact that [[cancerous]] tumors may be more difficult to detect in women with fibrocystic changes.

==Breast cancer risk==
Breast cancer risk is elevated for small fraction of lesions. Nonproliferative lesions have no increased risk, proliferative lesions approximately 2-fold risk. Atypical lobular hyperplasia is associated with the greatest risk, approximately 5-fold and especially high relative risk of developing premenopausal breast cancer. Atypical ductal hyperplasia is associated with 2.4-fold risk. <ref>{{cite pmid|9149887}}</ref> 

It is not well understood whether the lesions are precursors of breast cancer or only indication of increased risk, for most types of lesions the chance of developing breast cancer is nearly the same in  the affected and unaffected breast (side) indicating only coincidence of risk factors. For atypical lobular hyperplasia there is high incidence of ipsilateral breast cancers indicating a possible direct [[carcinogenesis|carcinogenetic]] link. <ref>{{cite pmid|12531579}}</ref>

==Eponyms==
This entity has historically also been termed ''Bloodgood’s disease'', ''Cooper's disease'' (after [[Astley Cooper|Sir Astley Paston Cooper, 1st baronet]]), ''Phocas' disease'', ''Reclus’ disease'' and ''Reclus’ syndrome'' (after [[Paul Reclus]]), ''Reclus-Schimmelbusch disease'', ''Schimmelbusch disease'' and ''Tillaux-Phocas disease''.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1891}}</ref>
