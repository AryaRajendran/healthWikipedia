{{Distinguish|Glycogenesis|Glyceroneogenesis}}

'''Gluconeogenesis''' (abbreviated '''GNG''') is a [[metabolic pathway]] that results in the generation of [[glucose]] from non-[[carbohydrate]] carbon substrates such as [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]], [[lactic acid|lactate]], [[glycerol]], [[glucogenic amino acid]]s, and odd-chain fatty acid.

It is one of the two main mechanisms humans and many other animals use to keep blood [[glucose]] levels from dropping too low ([[hypoglycemia]]). The other means of maintaining blood [[glucose]] levels is through the degradation of [[glycogen]] ([[glycogenolysis]]).<ref>{{cite web |last=Silva | first=Pedro  |title=The Chemical Logic Behind Gluconeogenesis | url=http://www2.ufp.pt/~pedros/bq/gng.htm | accessdate=September 8, 2009}}</ref>

Gluconeogenesis is a ubiquitous process, present in plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, and other microorganisms.<ref>{{cite book |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry |year=2000 |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=USA |isbn=1-57259-153-6 |pages=724 |author=David L Nelson and Michael M Cox }}</ref> In vertebrates, gluconeogenesis takes place mainly in the [[liver]] and, to a lesser extent, in the cortex of [[kidney]]s. In ruminants, this tends to be a continuous process.<ref>Young, J. W.  1977.  Gluconeogenesis in cattle: significance and methodology.  J. Dairy Sci. 60: 1-15.</ref>  In many other animals, the process occurs during periods of [[fasting]], [[starvation]], [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s, or intense [[exercise]].  The process is highly [[endergonic]] until ATP or GTP are utilized, effectively making the process [[exergonic]]. For example, the pathway leading from [[pyruvate]] to glucose-6-phosphate requires 4 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of GTP. Gluconeogenesis is often associated with [[ketosis]]. Gluconeogenesis is also a target of therapy for type II diabetes, such as [[metformin]], which inhibits glucose formation and stimulates glucose uptake by cells.<ref name = Hundal>{{cite journal | author = Hundal R, Krssak M, Dufour S, Laurent D, Lebon V, Chandramouli V, Inzucchi S, Schumann W, Petersen K, Landau B, Shulman G | title = Mechanism by Which Metformin Reduces Glucose Production in Type 2 Diabetes | journal = Diabetes | volume = 49 | issue = 12 | pages = 2063–9 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11118008 | doi = 10.2337/diabetes.49.12.2063 | pmc = 2995498}} {{PDFlink|[http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/reprint/49/12/2063 Free full text]|82&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]}}</ref>  In ruminants, because metabolizable dietary carbohydrates tend to be metabolized by rumen organisms, gluconeogenesis occurs regardless of fasting, low-carbohydrate diets, exercise, etc.<ref name=Beitz2004/>

[[File:Gluconeogenesis pathway.png|thumb|300px|Gluconeogenesis pathway with key molecules and enzymes. Many steps are the opposite of those found in the [[glycolysis]].]]

==Pathway==
Gluconeogenesis is a pathway consisting of a series of eleven enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The pathway may begin in the mitochondria or cytoplasm, this being dependent on the substrate being used. Many of the reactions are the reversible steps found in [[glycolysis]].
* Gluconeogenesis begins in the mitochondria with the formation of oxaloacetate by the carboxylation of pyruvate. This reaction also requires one molecule of [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], and is catalyzed by [[pyruvate carboxylase]]. This enzyme is stimulated by high levels of [[acetyl-CoA]] (produced in [[β-oxidation]] in the liver) and inhibited by high levels of ADP.
* Oxaloacetate is [[redox|reduced]] to [[malate]] using [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]], a step required for its transportation out of the mitochondria.
* Malate is [[redox|oxidized]] to oxaloacetate using NAD<sup>+</sup> in the cytosol, where the remaining steps of gluconeogenesis take place.
* Oxaloacetate is decarboxylated and then phosphorylated to form [[phosphoenolpyruvate]] using the enzyme [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase]]. A molecule of [[guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] is hydrolyzed to [[guanosine diphosphate|GDP]] during this reaction.
*The next steps in the reaction are the same as reversed glycolysis.  However, [[fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase]] converts [[fructose-1,6-bisphosphate]] to [[fructose 6-phosphate]], using one water molecule and releasing one phosphate.  This is also the rate-limiting step of gluconeogenesis.
* [[Glucose-6-phosphate]] is formed from [[fructose 6-phosphate]] by [[phosphoglucoisomerase]]. Glucose-6-phosphate can be used in other metabolic pathways or dephosphorylated to free glucose. Whereas free glucose can easily diffuse in and out of the cell, the phosphorylated form (glucose-6-phosphate) is locked in the cell, a mechanism by which intracellular glucose levels are controlled by cells.
*The final reaction of gluconeogenesis, the formation of glucose, occurs in the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], where glucose-6-phosphate is hydrolyzed by [[glucose-6-phosphatase]] to produce glucose. Glucose is shuttled into the cytoplasm by [[glucose transporter]]s located in the endoplasmic reticulum's membrane.

==Regulation==
While most steps in gluconeogenesis are the reverse of those found in [[glycolysis]], three regulated and strongly exergonic reactions are replaced with more kinetically favorable reactions. [[Hexokinase]]/[[glucokinase]], [[phosphofructokinase]], and [[pyruvate kinase]] enzymes of glycolysis are replaced with [[glucose-6-phosphatase]], [[fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase]], and [[PEP carboxykinase]]. This system of reciprocal control allow glycolysis and gluconeogenesis to inhibit each other and prevent the formation of a [[futile cycle]].

The majority of the [[enzymes]] responsible for gluconeogenesis are found in the [[cytoplasm]]; the exceptions are mitochondrial [[pyruvate carboxylase]] and, in animals, [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase]]. The latter exists as an isozyme located in both the [[mitochondrion]] and the [[cytosol]].<ref>Chakravarty, K., Cassuto, H., Resef, L., & Hanson, R.W. (2005) Factors that control the tissue-specific transcription of the gene for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-C. Critical Reviews of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 40(3), 129-154.</ref>  The rate of gluconeogenesis is ultimately controlled by the action of a key enzyme, [[fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase]], which is also regulated through signal transduction by [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] and its phosphorylation.

Most factors that regulate the activity of the gluconeogenesis pathway do so by inhibiting the activity or expression of key enzymes. However, both [[acetyl CoA]] and [[citrate]] activate gluconeogenesis enzymes (pyruvate carboxylase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, respectively). Due to the reciprocal control of the cycle, acetyl-CoA and citrate also have inhibitory roles in the activity of [[pyruvate kinase]].

Global control of gluconeogenesis is mediated by [[glucagon]] (''released when blood glucose is low''); it triggers phosphorylation of enzymes and regulatory proteins by [[Protein kinase A|Protein Kinase A]] (a cyclic AMP regulated kinase) resulting in inhibition of glycolysis and stimulation of gluconeogenesis. Recent studies have shown that the absence of hepatic glucose production has no major effect on the control of fasting plasma glucose concentration. Compensatory induction of gluconeogenesis occurs in the kidneys and intestine, driven by [[glucagon]], [[glucocorticoids]], and acidosis.<ref name = Mutel>{{cite journal | doi = 10.2337/db11-0571 | author = Mutel, E., Gautier-Stein, A., Abdul-Wahed, A., Amigó-Correig, M., Zitoun, C., Stefanutti, A., Houberdon, I., Tourette, J.A., Mithieux, G., Rajas, F. | title = Control of blood glucose in the absence of hepatic glucose production during prolonged fasting in mice: induction of renal and intestinal gluconeogenesis by glucagon.| journal = Diabetes | volume = 60 | issue = 12 | pages = 3121–3131 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22013018}}</ref>
