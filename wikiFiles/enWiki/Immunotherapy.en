'''Immunotherapy''' is a medical term defined as the "[[Therapy|treatment]] of [[disease]] by inducing, enhancing, or suppressing an immune response".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/immunotherapies?qsrc=2446 |title=immunotherapies definition |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=2009-06-02}}</ref> Immunotherapies designed to elicit or amplify an immune response are classified as '''activation immunotherapies,''' while immunotherapies that reduce or suppress are classified as '''[[Immunosuppression|suppression immunotherapies]].'''

==Immunomodulators==
The active agents of immunotherapy are collectively called immunomodulators. They are a diverse array of recombinant, synthetic and natural preparations, often [[cytokines]]. Some of these substances, such as [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]] (G-CSF), [[interferon]]s, [[imiquimod]] and cellular membrane fractions from [[bacteria]] are already licensed for use in patients. Others including [[Interleukin-2|IL-2]], [[Interleukin-7|IL-7]], [[Interleukin 12|IL-12]], various [[chemokine]]s, synthetic cytosine phosphate-guanosine (CpG), oligodeoxynucleotides and [[glucan]]s are currently being investigated extensively in clinical and preclinical studies. Immunomodulatory regimens offer an attractive approach as they often have fewer side effects than existing drugs, including less potential for creating resistance in microbial diseases.<ref name="pmid11727500">{{cite journal | author = Masihi KN | title = Fighting infection using immunomodulatory agents | journal = Expert Opin Biol Ther | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 641–53 | year = 2001 | month = July | pmid = 11727500 | doi = 10.1517/14712598.1.4.641 }}</ref>

'''Cell based Immunotherapies''' are proven to be effective for some cancers. Immune effector cells such as [[lymphocyte]]s, [[macrophage]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[natural killer cell]]s (NK Cell), cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), etc., work together to defend the body against cancer by targeting abnormal antigens expressed on the surface of the tumor due to mutation.

====Dendritic cell-based immunotherapy====

[[Dendritic cells]] can be stimulated to activate a [[cytotoxic]] response towards an [[antigen]].  Dendritic cells, a type of [[antigen presenting cell]], are harvested from a patient.  These cells are then either pulsed with an antigen or transfected with a [[viral vector]].  Upon transfusion back into the patient these activated cells present tumour antigen to effector lymphocytes (CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells). This initiates a cytotoxic response to occur against cells expressing tumour antigens (against which the adaptive response has now been primed).<ref name="pmid19483655">{{cite journal | author = Overes IM, Fredrix H, Kester MG, Falkenburg JH, van der Voort R, de Witte TM, Dolstra H | title = Efficient activation of LRH-1-specific CD8+ T-cell responses from transplanted leukemia patients by stimulation with P2X5 mRNA-electroporated dendritic cells | journal = J.

====T-cell adoptive transfer====

[[Adoptive cell transfer]] uses T cell-based cytotoxic responses to attack cancer cells. T cells that have a natural or genetically engineered reactivity to a patient's cancer are generated ''in vitro'' and then transferred back into the cancer patient.  One study using autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was an effective treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma;.<ref name=Rosenberg>{{cite journal | author = Rosenberg SA, Restifo NP, Yang JC, Morgan RA, Dudley ME | title = Adoptive cell transfer: a clinical path to effective cancer immunotherapy | journal = Nat.

These T cells are referred to as [[tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte]]s (TIL) are then encouraged to multiply ''in vitro'' using high concentrations of [[interleukin-2|IL-2]], anti-CD3 and allo-reactive feeder cells. These T cells are then transferred back into the patient along with exogenous administration of IL-2 to further boost their anti-cancer activity.

Thus far, a 51% objective response rate has been observed; and in some patients, tumors shrank to undetectable size.<ref name="pmid19482686">{{cite journal | author = Motohashi S, Nakayama T | title = Natural killer T cell-mediated immunotherapy for malignant diseases | journal = Front Biosci (Schol Ed) | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 108–16 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19482686 | doi = 10.2741/S10 }}</ref><ref name="pmid19479206">{{cite journal | author = Khattar M, Chen W, Stepkowski SM | title = Expanding and converting regulatory T cells: a horizon for immunotherapy | journal = Arch.

=====Genetically engineered T cells=====

Genetically engineered T cells are created by infecting patient's cells with a virus that contain a copy of a [[T cell receptor]] (TCR) gene that is specialised to recognise tumour antigens. The virus is not able to reproduce within the cell however integrates into the human genome. This is beneficial as new TCR gene remains stable in the T-cell. A patient's own T cells are exposed to these viruses and then expanded non-specifically or stimulated using the genetically engineered TCR. The cells are then transferred back into the patient and ready to have an immune response against the tumour. Morgan ''et al.''

===Immune recovery===

The potential use of immunotherapy to restore the immune system of patients with immune deficiencies as result of infection or chemotherapy. For example [[cytokines]] have been tested in clinical trials [[interleukin-7]] has been in clinical trials for HIV and cancer patients. In addition, [[interleukin-2]] has also been tested in HIV patients.

===Vaccination===

[[Anti-microbial]] immunotherapy, which includes [[vaccination]], involves activating the [[immune system]] to respond to an infectious agent.

==Suppression immunotherapies==

[[Immune suppression]] dampens an abnormal [[immune response]] in [[autoimmune diseases]] or reduces a normal [[immune response]] to prevent [[transplant rejection|rejection]] of [[Organ transplant|transplanted]] organs or cells.

===Immunosuppressive drugs===
{{main|Immunosuppressive drug}}
Immunosuppressive drugs are important tools in the management of organ transplantation and autoimmune disease.  Immune responses depend on lymphocyte proliferation, and [[Immunosuppressive_drug#Cytostatics|cytostatic drugs]] are immunosuppressive.  [[Immunosuppressive_drug#Glucocorticoids|Glucocorticoids]] are somewhat more specific inhibitors of lymphocyte activation, whereas inhibitors of [[Immunosuppressive_drug#Drugs_acting_on_immunophilins|immunophilins]] more specifically target T lymphocyte activation.  [[Immunosuppressive_drug#Antibodies|Immunosuppressive antibodies]] target an increasingly-broad array of steps in the immune response, and there are still [[Immunosuppressive_drug#Other_drugs|other drugs]] that modulate immune responses.

===Immune tolerance===

<!-- "Immune tolerance therapies" does such a concept exist -->
[[Immune tolerance]] is the process by which the body naturally does not launch an immune system attack on its own tissues. Immune tolerance therapies seeks to reset the immune system so that the body stops mistakenly attacking its own organs or cells in [[autoimmune disease]] or accepts foreign tissue in [[organ transplant]]ation.<ref name="pmid12110811">{{cite journal | author = Rotrosen D, Matthews JB, Bluestone JA | title = The immune tolerance network: a new paradigm for developing tolerance-inducing therapies | journal = J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. | volume = 110 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–23 | year = 2002 | month = July | pmid = 12110811 | doi = 10.1067/mai.2002.124258 }}</ref> A brief treatment should then reduce or eliminate the need for lifelong immunosuppression and the chances of attendant side effects, in the case of transplantation, or preserve the body's own function, at least in part, in cases of type 1 diabetes or other autoimmune disorders.

===Allergies===
{{main|Allergen immunotherapy}}

Immunotherapy is also used to treat [[allergy|allergies]]. While other allergy treatments (such as [[antihistamine]]s or [[corticosteroids]]) treat only the symptoms of allergic disease, immunotherapy is the only available treatment that can modify the natural course of the allergic disease, by reducing sensitivity to [[allergen]]s.

A one-to-five-year individually tailored regimen of injections may result in long-term benefits. Recent research suggests that patients who complete immunotherapy may continue to see benefits for years to come.<ref name="pmid10441602">{{cite journal | author = Durham SR, Walker SM, Varga EM, Jacobson MR, O'Brien F, Noble W, Till SJ, Hamid QA, Nouri-Aria KT | title = Long-term clinical efficacy of grass-pollen immunotherapy | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 341 | issue = 7 | pages = 468–75 | year = 1999 | month = August | pmid = 10441602 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199908123410702 }}</ref> Immunotherapy does not work for everyone and is only partly effective in some people, but it offers allergy sufferers the chance to eventually reduce or stop symptomatic/rescue medication.

The therapy is indicated for people who are extremely allergic or who cannot avoid specific [[allergen]]s. For example, they may not be able to live a normal life and completely avoid pollen, dust mites, mold spores, pet dander, insect venom, and certain other common triggers of allergic reactions. Immunotherapy is generally not indicated for food or medicinal allergies. Immunotherapy is typically individually tailored and administered by an allergist (allergologist) or through specialized physician offices. Injection schedules are available in some healthcare systems and can be prescribed by family physicians. This therapy is particularly useful for people with [[allergic rhinitis]] or [[asthma]].

The therapy is particularly likely to be successful if it begins early in life or soon after the allergy develops for the first time. Immunotherapy involves a series of injections (shots) given regularly for several years by a specialist in a hospital clinic. In the past, this was called a serum, but this is an incorrect name. Most allergists now call this mixture an allergy extract. The first shots contain very tiny amounts of the allergen or antigen to which one is allergic. With progressively increasing dosages over time, one's body adjusts to the allergen and becomes less sensitive to it, in a process known as desensitization.  A recently approved sublingual tablet ([[Grazax]]), containing a grass pollen extract, is similarly effective with few side effects, and can be self-administered at home, including by those patients who also suffer from allergic asthma, a condition which precludes the use of injection-based desensitization.

==Other approaches==

===Helminthic therapies===

Recent research into the clinical effectiveness of [[Whipworm]] [[Ovum|ova]] (''Trichuris suis'') and [[Hookworm]] (''Necator americanus'') for the treatment of certain immunological diseases and allergies means that these organisms must be classified as immuno-therapeutic agents. [[Helminthic therapy]] is being investigated as a potentially highly effective treatment for the symptoms and or disease process in disorders such as relapsing remitting [[multiple sclerosis]]<ref name="pmid17230481">{{cite journal | author = Correale J, Farez M | title = Association between parasite infection and immune responses in multiple sclerosis | journal = Ann.

That helminths modulate host immune response is proven, as the core assertion of the [[hygiene hypothesis]] appears to have been, with the recent publication of a study demonstrating that co-evolution with helminths has shaped at least some of the genes associated with [[Interleukin]] expression and immunological disorders, like [[Crohn's]], [[ulcerative colitis]] and [[Celiac Disease]]. Much of the research that has been published now indicates a key role, for what have been traditionally regarded as disease causing organisms, so that their relationship to humans as hosts should not be classified as parasitic, rather as mutualistic, [[symbionts]].
