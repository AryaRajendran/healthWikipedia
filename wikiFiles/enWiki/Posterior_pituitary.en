The '''posterior pituitary''' (or '''neurohypophysis''') comprises the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] lobe of the [[pituitary gland]] and is part of the [[endocrine system]]. Despite its name, the posterior pituitary gland is not a gland, ''per se''; rather, it is largely a collection of [[axon]]al projections from the [[hypothalamus]] that terminate behind the [[anterior pituitary gland]]. It is where  [[neurohypophysial hormone]]s are stored and released.

==Anatomy==
The posterior pituitary consists mainly of [[neuron]]al projections ([[axon]]s) of [[magnocellular neurosecretory cell]]s extending from the [[supraoptic nucleus|supraoptic]] and [[paraventricular nucleus|paraventricular nuclei]] of the [[hypothalamus]]. These axons store and release neurohypophysial hormones [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]] into the neurohypohyseal capillaries, from there they get into the [[systemic circulation]] (and partly back to the [[hypophyseal portal system]]). In addition to axons, the posterior pituitary also contains [[pituicyte]]s, specialized [[glial cell]]s resembling [[astrocyte]]s assisting in the storage and release of the hormones.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hatton|first=GI|title=Pituicytes, glia and control of terminal secretion.|journal=The Journal of experimental biology|date=1988 Sep|volume=139|pages=67-79|pmid=3062122|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/139/1/67.full.pdf}}</ref> 

Classification of the posterior pituitary varies, but most sources include the two regions below:
;Pars nervosa: Also called the neural lobe or posterior lobe, this region constitutes the majority of the posterior pituitary and is the storage site of oxytocin and vasopressin. Sometimes (incorrectly) considered synonymous with the posterior pituitary, the pars nervosa includes [[Herring bodies]] and [[pituicyte]]s.<ref>{{BUHistology|14004loa}}</ref>
;Infundibular stalk: Also known as the [[Pituitary stalk|infundibulum]] or pituitary stalk, the infundibular stalk bridges the hypothalamic and hypophyseal systems.

The [[median eminence]] is only occasionally included as part of the posterior pituitary.  Other sources specifically exclude it from the pituitary.<ref>{{MeshName|Median+eminence}}</ref>

A few sources include the [[pars intermedia]] as part of the posterior lobe, but this is a minority view. It is based upon the gross anatomical separation of the posterior and anterior pituitary along the cystic remnants of Rathke's pouch, causing the pars intermedia to remain attached to the neurohypophysis.

==Hormones secreted==
Hormones known classically as posterior pituitary hormones are synthesized by the hypothalamus. They are then stored in neurosecretory vesicles regrouped into Herring bodies before being secreted by the posterior pituitary into the bloodstream.

==Role in disease==
Insufficient secretion of [[vasopressin]] underlies [[diabetes insipidus]], a condition in which the body loses the capacity to concentrate urine. Affected individuals excrete as much as 20 liters of dilute urine per day. Oversecretion of vasopressin causes the [[syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone]] (SIADH).
