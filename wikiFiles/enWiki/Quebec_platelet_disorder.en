'''Quebec Platelet Disorder (QPD)''' is a rare, autosomal dominant bleeding disorder described in a family from the province of Quebec in Canada.<ref>Hayward CP, Rivard GE, Kane WH, Drouin J, Zheng S, Moore JC, Kelton JG. An autosomal dominant, qualitative platelet disorder associated with multimerin deficiency, abnormalities in platelet factor V, thrombospondin, von Willebrand factor, and fibrinogen and an epinephrine aggregation defect. ''Blood'' (1996) 87: 4967-78.</ref><ref>Diamandis M, Veljkovic DK, Maurer-Spurej E, Rivard GE, Hayward CPM. Quebec platelet disorder: features, pathogenesis and treatment. ''Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis'' (2008). 19(2): 109-119</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
The disorder is characterized by large amounts of the fibrinolytic enzyme [[urokinase]]-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) in [[platelets]].<ref name="Kahr, 2001">Kahr, 2001</ref> Consequently, stored platelet plasminogen is converted to [[plasmin]], which is thought to play a role in degrading a number of proteins stored in platelet Î±-granules.<ref>Sheth, 2003</ref> These proteins include platelet factor V, Von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, thrombospondin-1, and [[osteonectin]].<ref name="Kahr, 2001"/> There is also a quantitative deficiency in the platelet protein multimerin 1 ([[MMRN1]]). Furthermore, upon QPD platelet activation, u-PA can be released into forming clots and accelerate clot lysis, resulting in delayed-onset bleeding (12-24hrs after injury).<ref>Diamandis & Adam, 2006</ref>

==Presentation==
Individuals with QPD are at risk for experiencing a number of bleeding symptoms, including joint bleeds, hematuria, and large brusing.<ref>McKay & Haq, 2004</ref> In 2010, the genetic cause of QPD has been determined as a [[mutation]] involving an extra copy of the uPA ([[urokinase plasminogen activator]]) gene <ref>Persons with Quebec platelet disorder have a tandem duplication of PLAU, the urokinase plasminogen activator gene.  Paterson AD, Rommens JM, Bharaj B, Blavignac J, Wong I, Diamandis M, Waye JS, Rivard GE, Hayward CP.  Blood. 2010 Feb 11;115(6):1264-6. Epub 2009 Dec 9</ref> http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/115/6/1264.long. The mutation causes overproduction of an [[enzyme]] that accelerates [[blood clot]] breakdown.

==History==
The discovery was found by a team of doctors at [[McMaster University]], led by Dr. Catherine Hayward, a [[hematologist]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20100304/qpd_100304/20100304?hub=TopStoriesV2|title=Gene that causes rare bleeding disorder identified|publisher=[[CTV.ca]]|accessdate=2010-03-04}}</ref>
