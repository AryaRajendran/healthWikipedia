'''Training effect''' refers to specific changes in [[muscular]], [[cardiovascular]], and [[neurohumoral]] [[Biological system|systems]] that lead to improvement in [[functional capacity]] and [[physical strength|strength]] due to regular [[endurance training|endurance]] or [[resistance training]].<ref name="Awtry">{{cite book |last1=Awtry |first1=Eric H. |authorlink1= |last2=Balady |first2=Gary J. |authorlink2= |editor1-first=Eric J. |editor1-last=Topol |editor1-link=Eric Topol |others= |title=Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine |url=http://books.google.com/?id=35zSLWyEWbcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=February 9, 2011 |type= |edition=3rd |series= |volume= |date= |year=2007 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkin |location= |language= |isbn=0-7817-7012-2, 9780781770125 |page=83 |pages= |at= |trans_chapter= |chapter=Exercise and Physical Activity |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=35zSLWyEWbcC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA76#v=onepage&q&f=false |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}</ref> It has also been defined as a reaction to the adaptive responses of the body created by a training program<ref name="Bompa">{{cite book |last1=Bompa |first1=Tudor O. |authorlink1=Tudor Bompa |last2=Haff |first2=G.

[[Kenneth H. Cooper]] for the [[United States Air Force]] discovered this effect in the late 1960s and coined the term.<ref>Cooper, K. (1985) The aerobics program for total well-being: Exercise, diet, and emotional balance. NY: Bantam.</ref>{{Dubious|Dubious|date=December 2009}}

The measured effects were that muscles of respiration were strengthened, the heart was strengthened, blood pressure was sometimes lowered and the total amount of blood and number of red blood cells increased, making the blood a more efficient carrier of oxygen. [[VO2 Max|VO<sub>2</sub> Max]] was increased.

== Exercise ==

The exercise necessary can be accomplished by any [[aerobic exercise]] in a wide variety of schedules - Cooper found it best to award "points" for each amount of exercise (as laid out in the detailed tables in his classic 1968 book ''"Aerobics"'' ISBN 0-553-20992-2, reprinted and expanded several times) and require 30 points a week to maintain the Training Effect. 

Cooper instead recommended a "12-minute test" (the [[Cooper test]]) followed by adherence to the appropriate starting-up schedule in his book. As always, he recommends that a physical exam should precede any exercise program. (A newly-recognized effect is that of [[Exercise hypertension]], for which there is a medical test.)

The physiological effects of training have received much further study since Cooper's original work. It is now generally considered that effects of exercise on general metabolic rate ([[Excess post-exercise oxygen consumption|post-exercise]]) are comparatively small and the greatest effect occurs for only a few hours. Though endurance training does increase the [[VO2 max|VO<sub>2</sub> max]] of many people, there is considerable variation in the degree to which it increases [[VO2 max|VO<sub>2</sub> max]] between individuals.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Bouchard | first = Claude | coauthors = Ping An, Treva Rice, James S.

[[Tudor Bompa]] has classified training effect into three categories: immediate training, delayed, and cumulative.<ref name="Bompa"/>
