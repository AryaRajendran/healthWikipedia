'''Jumping Frenchmen of Maine''' is a rare disorder of unknown origin.  It entails an exaggerated [[startle response|"startle" reflex]]<ref name="howard"> {{cite journal |author=Howard R, Ford R |title=From the jumping Frenchmen of Maine to post-traumatic stress disorder: the startle response in neuropsychiatry |journal=Psychol Med |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=695–707 |year=1992 |month=August |pmid=1410093 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291700038137}}</ref> which may be described as an uncontrollable "jump" but individuals with this condition can exhibit sudden movements in all parts of the body. 

Jumping Frenchmen shares symptoms with other startle disorders. Individuals with this condition were first found in the northern regions of Maine; hence, the name for the condition.<ref name="stevens"> {{cite journal |author=Stevens H |title="Jumping Frenchmen of Maine." Myriachit |journal=Arch. Neurol. |volume=12 |issue= |pages=311–4 |year=1965 |month=March |pmid=14247390 }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[George Miller Beard]] recorded individuals who would obey any command given suddenly, even if it meant striking a loved one; the "Jumping Frenchmen" seemed to react abnormally to sudden stimuli.<ref name="stevens"/> The more common and less intense symptoms consist of jumping, yelling, and hitting. These individuals exhibited outrageous bursts, and many described themselves as ticklish and shy. Other cases involved [[echolalia]] (repeating vocalizations made by another person) and  [[echopraxia]] (repeating movements made by another person).<ref name="video"> {{cite journal |author=Saint-Hilaire MH, Saint-Hilaire JM |title=Jumping Frenchmen of Maine |journal=Mov. Disord. |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=530 |year=2001 |month=May |pmid=11391751 }}</ref><ref name="history"> {{cite journal |author=Lanska DJ |title=Chapter 33: the history of movement disorders |journal=Handb Clin Neurol |volume=95 |issue= |pages=501–46 |year=2010 |pmid=19892136 |doi=10.1016/S0072-9752(08)02133-7 }}</ref><ref name="kunkle"> {{cite journal |author=Kunkle EC |title=The "jumpers" of Maine: a reappraisal |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=119 |issue=4 |pages=355–8 |year=1967 |month=April |pmid=6022518 }}</ref> Beard noted that the men were "suggestible"<ref name=Kushner22/> and that they "could not help repeating the word or sounds that came from the person that ordered them any more than they could help striking, dropping, throwing, jumping or starting."<ref name=Kushner22/>

==Causes==
The cause of Jumping Frenchmen is unknown.<ref>[http://www.rarediseases.org/search/rdbdetail_abstract.html?disname=Jumping%20Frenchmen%20of%20Maine NORD]</ref>  

One theory is that it is a genetic condition.<ref name="lanska"> {{cite journal |author=Lanska DJ |title=Classic articles of 19th-century American neurologists: a critical review |journal=J Hist Neurosci |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=156–73 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12122807 |doi=10.1076/jhin.11.2.156.15196 |url=}}</ref> Observation of 50 cases found the disorder to be remotely located and concentrated in the northern regions of Maine. Fourteen of theses cases were found in four families.<ref name="stevens"/> Another set of cases were found in a single family where the father, his two sons, and his two grandchildren exhibited "jumping" behavior.<ref name="kunkle"/> 

It may also be a cultural personality or a formed habit. These French "jumpers" lived in a very remote region and most were lumberjacks. This type of small community would allow for a majority to adapt to this sort of reaction. Also, instances of many being shy may imply that the "jumper" was positively reinforced by the sudden attention as the entertainment for a group.<ref name="video"/>

In 1885, [[Georges Gilles de la Tourette]] included Jumping Frenchmen in the typology of "convulsive tic illness";<ref name=Kushner22/> studies of the condition in the 1980s cast doubt on whether the phenomenon was in fact a physical condition similar to [[Tourette syndrome]]. Documentation of direct observation of "Jumping Frenchmen" has been scarce, and while videotape evidence was recorded by several researchers that showed the condition to be real, MH and JM Saint-Hilaire concluded from studying eight affected people that it was brought on by conditions at their lumber camps and was psychological, not neurological.<ref name="saint">{{cite journal | author = Saint-Hilaire M, Saint-Hilaire J, Granger L | title = Jumping Frenchmen of Maine | journal = Neurology | volume = 36 | issue = 9 | pages = 1269–71 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3528919}}</ref>

==Differential diagnosis==
Jumping Frenchmen of Maine must be distinguished from other conditions involving the startle reflex or [[tic]]s.

[[Tourette syndrome]] is characterized by multiple physical (motor) [[tics]] and at least one vocal (phonic) tic. There are many overlaps when compared clinically, but the abnormal "jumping" response is always provoked, unlike the involuntary tics in Tourette syndrome.<ref name="lanska"/>

[[Latah]] from Southeast Asia is a disorder where one's startle response is similar to a state of [[trance]] with repetitive speech or movements. Miryachit is a disorder found in Siberia that also displays an action similar to "jumping". [[Neurasthenia]] is a disorder with a startle response during periods of great fatigue.

[[Hyperekplexia]] is an extremely rare autosomal dominant neurological disease.  The symptoms start in infancy with [[hypertonia]], an abnormal muscle tension that decreases flexibility, and an exaggerated startle in all ages of life.<ref name="lanska"/>

==History==
Beard had a unique interest in unusual disorders and jumped at the opportunity to observe the endemic in Maine.<ref name="lanska"/> He recorded "startle, jumping and tic-like behaviors"<ref name=Kushner22> Kushner (2000), p. 22.</ref> among the French Canadians and lumberjacks who lived near [[Moosehead Lake]] in northern Maine.<ref name="lanska"/> He published his descriptions of the Jumping Frenchmen in 1880, and he believed the condition was hereditary.<ref name=Kushner22/> History of Medicine professor Howard I. Kushner calls Beard's description "the most influential and detailed study" of these behaviors.<ref name=Kushner22/>

According to Kushner, the French physician [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] chose his resident, [[Georges Gilles de la Tourette]], to investigate the "relationship between [[tic disorder]]s and jumping and startle behaviors reported in Malaysia, Siberia, and Maine";<ref name=Kushner21> Kushner (2000), p. 21.</ref> Gilles de la Tourette translated Beard's descriptions and published them one year after Beard's papers.<ref name=Kushner22/>  In 1885, Tourette published "Study of a Nervous Affliction" where he included the startle disorders in the typology of what he called "convulsive tic illness", that included what later came to be known as Tourette syndrome.<ref name=Kushner22/><ref name="saint"/>  Kushner argues that none of the patients studied by Tourette supported this assertion,<ref name=Kushner22/> and says that "many of his contemporaries refuted Gilles de la Tourette's typology".<ref name=Kushner25> Kushner (2000), p. 25.</ref>
