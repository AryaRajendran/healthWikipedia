| quote=Well, the truth is now out and the fact is Shona Holmes never actually had a life-threatening brain tumor, as she's been claiming in those ads and all the interviews she's been giving. Instead, according to the Mayo Clinic where she was treated, her "brain tumor" was actually a Rathke's Cleft Cyst on her pituitary gland and "Rathke's Cleft Cysts are not true tumors or neoplasms; instead they are benign cysts."

| quote=Yes, Canadians frequently have longer waiting periods for elective surgery, sometimes even for procedures that seem only marginally elective, like hip-joint replacement. But the ads featuring lies spewed out by Shona Holmes about her supposed Canadian medical nightmare are scare tactics at its most vile and desperate.

| quote=According to Canadian news reports, Holmes has faced a barrage of criticism and even “death threats,” she says, for speaking against the Canadian health system in U.S. appearances. Canada’s Globe and Mail newspaper reported  July 30 that “she’s increased security at her home and even given the family dog to her daughter, because of threats that her lawn will be poisoned.”
