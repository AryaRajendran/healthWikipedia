Mutations that deactivate p53 in cancer usually occur in the DBD. Most of these mutations destroy the ability of the protein to bind to its target DNA sequences, and thus prevents transcriptional activation of these genes. As such, mutations in the DBD are [[recessive allele|recessive]] [[loss-of-function]] mutations. Molecules of p53 with mutations in the OD dimerise with [[wild-type]] p53, and prevent them from activating transcription. Therefore OD mutations have a dominant negative effect on the function of p53. An example of a mutation in P53 is where [[arginine 248]] is altered, sometimes causing a disruption in balance and making the protein unable to bind with the [[DNA]].

Wild-type p53 is a [[labile]] [[protein]], comprising folded and [[Intrinsically unstructured proteins|unstructured regions]] that function in a synergistic manner.<ref name="pmid12367518">{{vcite journal | author = Bell S, Klein C, Müller L, Hansen S, Buchner J | title = p53 contains large unstructured regions in its native state | journal = J.

== Function ==
p53 has many mechanisms of anticancer function, and plays a role in apoptosis, genomic stability, and inhibition of [[angiogenesis]]. In its anti-cancer role, p53 works through several mechanisms:
* It can activate [[DNA repair]] proteins when DNA has sustained damage.
* It can arrest growth by holding the [[cell cycle]] at the G<sub>1</sub>/S regulation point on DNA damage recognition (if it holds the cell here for long enough, the DNA repair proteins will have time to fix the damage and the cell will be allowed to continue the cell cycle).
* It can initiate [[apoptosis]], the programmed cell death, if DNA damage proves to be irreparable.

[[Image:P53 pathways.jpg|300px|right|thumb|'''p53 pathway:''' In a normal cell p53 is inactivated by its negative regulator, mdm2. Upon DNA damage or other stresses, various pathways will lead to the dissociation of the p53 and mdm2 complex. Once activated, p53 will induce a cell cycle arrest to allow either repair and survival of the cell or apoptosis to discard the damaged cell. How p53 makes this choice is currently unknown.]]

This activation is marked by two major events. First, the half-life of the p53 protein is increased drastically, leading to a quick accumulation of p53 in stressed cells. Second, a [[conformational change]] forces p53 to be activated as a [[Transcriptional regulation|transcription regulator]] in these cells. The critical event leading to the activation of p53 is the phosphorylation of its N-terminal domain. The N-terminal transcriptional activation domain contains a large number of phosphorylation sites and can be considered as the primary target for protein kinases transducing stress signals.

The [[protein kinases]] that are known to target this transcriptional activation domain of p53 can be roughly divided into two groups. A first group of protein kinases belongs to the [[MAPK]] family (JNK1-3, ERK1-2, p38 MAPK), which is known to respond to several types of stress, such as membrane damage, oxidative stress, osmotic shock, heat shock, etc. A second group of protein kinases ([[Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related|ATR]], [[Ataxia telangiectasia mutated|ATM]], [[Chk1|CHK1]] and [[Chk2|CHK2]], [[DNA-PKcs|DNA-PK]], CAK, [[TP53RK]]) is implicated in the genome integrity checkpoint, a molecular cascade that detects and responds to several forms of DNA damage caused by genotoxic stress. Oncogenes also stimulate p53 activation, mediated by the protein [[p14ARF]].

In unstressed cells, p53 levels are kept low through a continuous degradation of p53. A protein called [[Mdm2]] (also called HDM2 in humans), which is itself a product of p53, binds to p53, preventing its action and transports it from the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] to the [[cytosol]]. Also Mdm2 acts as [[ubiquitin ligase]] and covalently attaches [[ubiquitin]] to p53 and thus marks p53 for degradation by the [[proteasome]]. However, ubiquitylation of p53 is reversible. A ubiquitin specific protease, [[USP7]] (or [[USP7|HAUSP]]), can cleave ubiquitin off p53, thereby protecting it from proteasome-dependent degradation. This is one means by which p53 is stabilized in response to oncogenic insults. [[USP42]] has also been shown to deubiquitinate p53 and may be required for the ability of p53 to respond to stress.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hock AK, Vigneron AM, Carter S, Ludwig RL, Vousden KH | year = 2011 | title = Regulation of p53 stability and function by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP42 | url = | journal = EMBO J | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 4921–30 }}</ref> Recent research has shown that HAUSP is a mainly localized in the nucleus, though a fraction of it can be found in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Over expression of HAUSP results in p53 stabilization. However, depletion of HAUSP does not result to a decrease in p53 levels but rather increases p53 levels due to the fact that HAUSP binds and deubiquitinates Mdm2. It has been shown that HAUSP is a better binding partner to Mdm2 than p53 in unstressed cells. USP10 however has been shown to be located in the cytoplasm in unstressed cells and deubiquitinates cyptoplasmic p53, reversing Mdm2 ubiquitination. Following DNA damage, USP10 translocates to the nucleus and contributes to p53 stability. Also USP10 does not interact with Mdm2.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Yuan et al|title=USP10 regulates p53 localiztion and Stability by Deubiquitinating p53|date=5|year=2011|month=February}}</ref>

Phosphorylation of the N-terminal end of p53 by the above-mentioned protein kinases disrupts Mdm2-binding. Other proteins, such as Pin1, are then recruited to p53 and induce a conformational change in p53, which prevents Mdm2-binding even more. Phosphorylation also allows for binding of transcriptional coactivators, like [[EP300|p300]] or [[PCAF]], which then acetylate the carboxy-terminal end of p53, exposing the DNA binding domain of p53, allowing it to activate or repress specific genes. Deacetylase enzymes, such as [[Sirt1]] and [[Sirt7]], can deacetylate p53, leading to an inhibition of apoptosis.<ref name="pmid18239138">{{vcite journal | author = Vakhrusheva O, Smolka C, Gajawada P, Kostin S, Boettger T, Kubin T, Braun T, Bober | title = Sirt7 increases stress resistance of cardiomyocytes and prevents apoptosis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy in mice | journal = Circ.

If the ''TP53'' gene is damaged, tumor suppression is severely reduced. People who inherit only one functional copy of the ''TP53'' gene will most likely develop tumors in early adulthood, a disease known as [[Li-Fraumeni syndrome]]. The ''TP53'' gene can also be damaged in cells by [[mutagen]]s ([[chemical substance|chemicals]], [[radiation]], or [[virus]]es), increasing the likelihood that the cell will begin decontrolled division. More than 50 percent of [[human]] [[tumor]]s contain a [[mutation]] or [[genetic deletion|deletion]] of the ''TP53'' gene.<ref name="pmid1905840">{{vcite journal | author = Hollstein M, Sidransky D, Vogelstein B, Harris CC | title = p53 mutations in human cancers | journal = Science | volume = 253 | issue = 5015 | pages = 49–53 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1905840 | doi = 10.1126/science.1905840 }}</ref> Increasing the amount of p53, which may initially seem a good way to treat tumors or prevent them from spreading, is in actuality not a usable method of treatment, since it can cause premature aging.<ref name="pmid11780111">{{vcite journal | author = Tyner SD, Venkatachalam S, Choi J, Jones S, Ghebranious N, Igelmann H, Lu X, Soron G, Cooper B, Brayton C, Hee Park S, Thompson T, Karsenty G, Bradley A, Donehower LA | title = p53 mutant mice that display early ageing-associated phenotypes | journal = Nature | volume = 415 | issue = 6867 | pages = 45–53 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11780111 | doi = 10.1038/415045a }}</ref> However, restoring [[endogenous]] p53 function holds a lot of promise.

Thus, pharmacological reactivation of p53 presents itself as a viable cancer treatment option.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ventura|first=Andrea|coauthors=David Kirsch, Margaret McLaughlin, David A.

Certain pathogens can also affect the p53 protein that the ''TP53'' gene expresses. One such example, [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV), encodes a protein, E6, which binds to the p53 protein and inactivates it. This, in synergy with the inactivation of another cell cycle regulator, [[pRb]], by the HPV protein E7, allows for repeated cell division manifested in the clinical disease of [[wart]]s. Certain HPV types, in particular types 16 and 18, can also lead to progression from a benign wart to low or high-grade [[cervical dysplasia]], which are reversible forms of precancerous lesions. Persistent infection of the [[cervix]] over the years can cause irreversible changes leading to [[carcinoma in situ]] and eventually invasive cervical cancer. This results from the effects of HPV genes, particularly those encoding E6 and E7, which are the two viral oncoproteins that are preferentially retained and expressed in cervical cancers by integration of the viral DNA into the host genome.<ref name="pmid18086422">{{vcite journal | author = Angeletti PC, Zhang L, Wood C | title = The Viral Etiology of AIDS-Associated Malignancies | journal = Adv.

In healthy humans, the p53 protein is continually produced and degraded in the cell. The degradation of the p53 protein is, as mentioned, associated with MDM2 binding. In a negative feedback loop, MDM2 is itself induced by the p53 protein. However, mutant p53 proteins often do not induce MDM2, and are thus able to accumulate at very high concentrations. Worse, mutant p53 protein itself can inhibit normal p53 protein levels. In some cases, single missense mutations in p53 have been shown to disrupt p53 stability and function.<ref name="Bullock_1997">{{vcite journal | author = Bullock AN, Henckel J, DeDecker BS, Johnson CM, Nikolova PV, Proctor MR, Lane DP, Fersht AR | title = Thermodynamic stability of wild-type and mutant p53 core domain | journal = Proc.

Most p53 mutations are detected by DNA sequencing. However, it is known that single missense mutations can have a large spectrum from rather mild to very severe functional effects.<ref name="Bullock_1997"/>

== Discovery ==
p53 was identified in 1979 by [[Lionel Crawford]], [[David P. Lane]], [[Arnold J. Levine|Arnold Levine]], and [[Lloyd Old]], working at [[Imperial Cancer Research Fund]] (UK) [[Princeton University]]/UMDNJ (Cancer Institute of New Jersey), and [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]], respectively. It had been hypothesized to exist before as the target of the [[SV40]] virus, a strain that induced development of tumors. The ''TP53'' gene from the mouse was first cloned by [[Peter Chumakov]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in 1982,<ref name="pmid6295732">{{vcite journal | author = Chumakov PM, Iotsova VS, Georgiev GP | title = [Isolation of a plasmid clone containing the mRNA sequence for mouse nonviral T-antigen] | language = Russian | journal = Dokl.

It was initially presumed to be an [[oncogene]] due to the use of mutated [[cDNA]] following purification of tumour cell [[mRNA]]. Its character as a [[tumor suppressor gene]] was finally revealed in 1989 by [[Bert Vogelstein]] working at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]].<ref name="pmid2649981">{{vcite journal | author = Baker SJ, Fearon ER, Nigro JM, Hamilton SR, Preisinger AC, Jessup JM, vanTuinen P, Ledbetter DH, Barker DF, Nakamura Y, White R, Vogelstein B | title = Chromosome 17 deletions and p53 gene mutations in colorectal carcinomas | journal = Science | volume = 244 | issue = 4901 | pages = 217–21 | year = 1989 | month = April | pmid = 2649981 | doi = 10.1126/science.2649981 }}</ref>

In 1992, [[Wafik El-Deiry]] when he was working with [[Bert Vogelstein]] at Johns Hopkins University identified the [[consensus sequence]], to which human p53 could bind, by immunoprecipitating human genomic DNA that could be bound by [[baculovirus]]-produced human p53 protein. This sequence was published in the first issue of the journal Nature Genetics in 1992 in work that is highly cited. The consensus sequence is 5'-RRRCWWGYYY-N(0-13)-RRRCWWGYYY-3' and is located in the regulatory regions of genes that are activated by the p53 transcription factor. The presence of p53 response elements in or around genes (promoters, upstream sequences, introns) is a powerful predictor of regulation and activation of a particular gene by p53.

In 1993, p53 was voted ''molecule of the year'' by [[Science (journal)|Science]] magazine.<ref name="pmid8266084">{{vcite journal | author = Koshland DE | title = Molecule of the year | journal = Science | volume = 262 | issue = 5142 | pages = 1953 | year = 1993 | month = December | pmid = 8266084 | doi = 10.1126/science.8266084 }}</ref>

That same year, 1993, Wafik El-Deiry when he was working with Bert Vogelstein at Johns Hopkins University discovered p21(WAF1) as a gene regulated directly by p53. This work was reported in the most highly cited paper ever published in the journal Cell, and provided a molecular mechanism by which mammalian cells undergo growth arrest when damaged. The p21(WAF1) protein binds directly to cyclin-CDK complexes that drive forward the cell cycle and inhibits their kinase activity thereby causing cell cycle arrest to allow repair to take place. p21 can also mediate growth arrest associated with differentiation and a more permanent growth arrest associated with cellular senescence. The p21 gene contains several p53 response elements that mediate direct binding of the p53 protein, resulting in transcriptional activation of the gene encoding the p21(WAF1) protein.
