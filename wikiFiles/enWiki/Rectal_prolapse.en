'''Rectal prolapse''' (rectal procidentia) refers to a medical condition where a section of the wall of the rectum [[prolapse]]s (falls down) from the normal anatomical position with associated [[pelvic floor]] dysfunction. This may occur while straining to defecate, or during rest. 

Used unqualified, the term rectal prolapse often is used synonymously with '''complete rectal prolapse''' (external rectal prolapse), where the rectal walls have prolapsed to a degree where they protrude out the [[anus]] and are visible outside the body.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rectal Prolapse: Diagnosis and Clinical Management |first1=Donato F. |last1=Altomare |first2=Filippo |last2=Pucciani |publisher=Springer |year=2007 |page=12 |isbn=978-88-470-0683-6}}</ref> However, most researchers agree that there are 3 to 5 different types of rectal prolapse, depending on if the prolapsed section is visible externally, and if the full or only partial thickness of the rectal wall is involved.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception">{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Donald G.|title=ASCRS core subjects: Prolapse and Intussusception|url=http://www.fascrs.org/physicians/education/core_subjects/2000/prolapse_and_intussusception/|publisher=ASCRS|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref><ref name="Contemporary surgery online">{{cite web|last=Kiran|first=Ravi Pokala|title=How stapled resection can treat rectal prolapse|url=http://www.contemporarysurgery.com/inside.asp?ArtID=6287|publisher=Contemporary surgery online|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref> 

Rectal prolapse may occur without any symptoms, but depending upon the nature of the prolapse there may be [[rectal discharge|mucous discharge]] (mucus coming from the anus), [[rectal bleeding]], degrees of [[fecal incontinence]] and [[obstructed defecation]] symptoms.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> 

Rectal prolapse is generally more common in elderly women, although it may occur at any age and in both sexes. It is very rarely life threatening, but the symptoms can be debilitating if left untreated.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> Most external prolapse cases can be treated successfully, often with a surgical procedure. Internal prolapses are traditionally harder to treat and surgery may not be suitable for many patients.

==Terminology==

'''Prolapse''' refers to "the falling down or slipping of a body part from its usual position or relations". It is derived from the Latin ''pro-'' - "forward" + ''labi'' - "to slide". {{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Prolapse}} [[Prolapse]] can refer to many different medical conditions other than rectal prolapse.

'''procidentia''' has a similar meaning to prolapse, referring to "a sinking or prolapse of an organ or part". It is derived from the Latin ''procidere'' - "to fall forward".<ref>{{cite web|title=Procidentia on the Free Dictionary|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/procidentia|publisher=Farlex Inc.|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref> [[Procidentia]] usually refers to [[uterine prolapse]], but rectal procidentia can also be a synonym for rectal prolapse.

'''Intussusception''' is defined as [[invagination]] (infolding), especially referring to "the slipping of a length of intestine into an adjacent portion". It is derived from the Latin ''intus'' - "within" and ''susceptio'' - "action of undertaking", from ''suscipere'' - "to take up". {{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Intussusception}} Rectal intussusception is not to be confused with other [[intussusception (medical disorder)|intussusception]]s involving [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] or [[small intestine]], which can sometimes be a medical emergency. Rectal intussusception by contrast is not life threatening.

'''Intussusceptum''' refers to the [[proximal]] section of rectal wall, which telescopes into the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the [[distal]] section of [[rectum]] (termed the '''intussuscipiens''').<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> What results is 3 layers of rectal wall overlayed. From the lumen outwards, the first layer is the proximal wall of the intussusceptum, the middle is the wall of the intussusceptum folded back on its self, and the outer is the distal rectal wall, the intussuscipiens.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" />

The different kinds of rectal prolapse can be difficult to grasp, as different definitions are used and some recognize some subtypes and others do not. Essentially, rectal prolapses may be

*'''full thickness''' (complete), where all the layers of the rectal wall prolapse, or involve the '''mucosal''' layer only (partial)
*'''external'''  if they protrude from the anus and are visible externally, or '''internal''' if they do not
*'''circumferential''', where the whole circumference of the rectal wall prolapse, or '''segmental''' if only parts of the circumference of the rectal wall prolapse
*present at rest, or occurring during straining.

'''External (complete) rectal prolapse''' (rectal procidentia, full thickness rectal prolapse, external rectal prolapse) is
a full thickness, circumferential, true intussusception of the rectal wall which protrudes from the anus and is visible externally.<ref name="Tou 2008 (cochrane)">{{cite journal|last=Tou|first=S|coauthors=Brown, SR; Malik, AI; Nelson, RL|title=Surgery for complete rectal prolapse in adults.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2008 Oct 8|issue=4|pages=CD001758|pmid=18843623}}</ref><ref>Altomare, Pucciani (2007) p.14</ref>

'''Internal rectal intussusception''' (occult rectal prolapse, internal procidentia) can be defined as defined as a funnel shaped infolding of the upper rectal (or lower [[sigmoid colon|sigmoid]]) wall that can occur during [[defecation]].<ref name="Coloproctology">{{cite book|last=Wexner|first=edited by Andrew P.

However, a publication by the American society of colon and rectal surgeons stated that internal rectal intussusception involved the [[mucosa]]l and [[submucosa]]l layers separating from the underlying [[muscularis mucosa]] layer attachments, resulting in the separated portion of rectal lining “sliding” down.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> This may signify that authors use the terms internal rectal prolapse and internal mucosal prolapse to describe the same phenomena.

'''Internal mucosal prolapse''' (rectal internal mucosal prolapse, RIMP) refers to prolapse of the mucosal layer of the rectal wall which does not protrude externally. There is some controversy surrounding this condition as to its relationship with hemorrhoidal disease, or whether it is a separate entity.<ref name="Gaj 2005">{{cite journal|last=Gaj|first=F|coauthors=Trecca, A|title=Hemorrhoids and rectal internal mucosal prolapse: one or two conditions?

'''Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome''' (SRUS, solitary rectal ulcer, SRU) occurs with internal rectal intussusception and is part of the spectrum of rectal prolapse conditions.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS">{{cite web|last=Madhulika|first=G|title=Prolapse, Intussusception, & SRUS|url=http://www.fascrs.org/physicians/education/core_subjects/2008/prolapse_intussusception_srus/|publisher=ASCRS|accessdate=13 October 2012|coauthors=Varma, MD}}</ref> It describes [[ulceration]] of the rectal lining caused by repeated frictional damage as the internal intussusception is forced into the anal canal during straining. SRUS can be considered a consequence of internal intussusception, which can be demonstrated in 94% of cases.

'''Mucosal prolapse syndrome''' (MPS) is recognized by some. It includes solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, rectal prolapse, proctitis cystica profunda, and inflammatory polyps.<ref name=nonaka>{{cite journal|last=Nonaka|first=T|coauthors=Inamori, M; Kessoku, T; Ogawa, Y; Yanagisawa, S; Shiba, T; Sakaguchi, T; Gotoh, E; Maeda, S; Nakajima, A; Atsukawa, K; Takahasi, H; Akasaka, Y|title=A case of rectal cancer arising from long-standing prolapsed mucosa of the rectum.|journal=Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)|year=2011|volume=50|issue=21|pages=2569–73|pmid=22041358}}</ref><ref name=abid>{{cite journal|last=Abid|first=S|coauthors=Khawaja, A; Bhimani, SA; Ahmad, Z; Hamid, S; Jafri, W|title=The clinical, endoscopic and histological spectrum of the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome: a single-center experience of 116 cases.|journal=BMC gastroenterology|date=2012 Jun 14|volume=12|issue=1|page=72|pmid=22697798}}</ref> It is classified as a chronic benign inflammatory disorder.

Rectal prolapse and internal rectal intussusception has been classified according to the size of the prolapsed section of rectum, a function of rectal mobility from the sacrum and infolding of the rectum. This classification also takes into account sphincter relaxation:<ref name="Fleshman 1989">{{cite journal|last=Fleshman|first=JW|coauthors=Kodner, IJ; Fry, RD|title=Internal intussusception of the rectum: a changing perspective.|journal=The Netherlands journal of surgery|date=1989 Dec|volume=41|issue=6|pages=145–8|pmid=2694021}}</ref> 
* Grade I: nonrelaxation of the sphincter mechanism ([[anismus]])
* Grade II: mild intussusception
* Grade III: moderate intussusception
* Grade IV: severe intussusception
* Grade V: rectal prolapse

Rectal internal mucosal prolapse has been graded according to the level of descent of the intussusceptum, which was predictive of symptom severity:<ref name="Pescatori 1999">{{cite journal|last=Pescatori|first=M|coauthors=Quondamcarlo, C|title=A new grading of rectal internal mucosal prolapse and its correlation with diagnosis and treatment.|journal=International journal of colorectal disease|date=1999 Nov|volume=14|issue=4-5|pages=245–9|pmid=10647634}}</ref> 
* first degree prolapse is detectable below the anorectal ring on straining
* second degree when it reached the dentate line
* third degree when it reached the anal verge

[[File:Internal rectal intussusception.jpg|537px|framed|Right|A. Normal anatomy: (r) rectum, (a) anal canal <br> B. Recto-rectal intussusception <br> C. Recto-anal intussusception]]
The most widely used classification of internal rectal prolapse is according to the height on the rectal/sigmoid wall from which they originate and by whether the intussusceptum remains within the rectum or extends into the [[anal canal]]. The height of intussusception from the anal canal is usually estimated by [[defecography]].<ref name="Obstructed defecation web" /> 

'''Recto-rectal (high) intussusception''' (intra-rectal intussusception) is where the intussuscetption starts in the rectum, does not protrude into the anal canal, but stays within the rectum. (i.e. the intussusceptum originates in the rectum and does not extend into the anal canal. The intussuscipiens includes rectal lumen distal to the intussusceptum only). These are usually intussusceptions that originate in the upper rectum or lower [[sigmoid colon|sigmoid]].<ref name="Obstructed defecation web" />

'''Recto-anal (low) intussusception''' (intra-anal intussusception) is where the intussusception starts in the rectum and protrudes into the anal canal (i.e. the intussusceptum originates in the rectum, and the intussuscipiens includes part of the anal canal)

An Anatomico-Functional Classification of internal rectal intussusception has been described,<ref name="Obstructed defecation web" /> with the argument that other factors apart from the height of intussusception above the anal canal appear to be important to predict symptomology. The parameters of this classification are anatomic descent, diameter of intussuscepted bowel, associated rectal hyposensitivity and associated delayed colonic transit:

* Type 1: Internal recto-rectal intussusception
**Type 1W Wide lumen
**Type 1N Narrowed lumen
*Type 2: Internal recto-anal intussusception
**Type 2W Wide Lumen
**Type 2N Narrowed lumen
**Type 2M Narrowed internal lumen with associated rectal hyposensitivity or early megarectum
*Type 3: Internal-external recto-anal intussusception

==Diagnosis==

===History===

Patients may have associated gynecological conditions which may require multidisciplinary management.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> History of constipation is important because some of the operations may worsen constipation. Fecal incontinence may also influence the choice of management.

===Physical examination===
Rectal prolapse may be confused easily with prolapsing hemorrhoids.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> Mucosal prolapse also differs from prolapsing (3rd or 4th degree) hemorrhoids, where there is a segmental prolapse of the hemorrhoidal tissues at the 3,7 and 11’O clock positions.<ref name="Gupta 2006" /> Mucosal prolapse can be differentiated from a full thickness external rectal prolapse (a complete rectal prolapse) by the orientation of the folds (furrows) in the prolapsed section. In full thickness rectal prolapse, these folds run circumferential.  In mucosal prolapse, these folds are radially.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> The folds in mucosal prolapse are usually associated with internal hemorrhoids. Furthermore, in rectal prolapse, there is a sulcus present between the prolapsed bowel and the anal verge, whereas is hemorrhoidal disease there is no sulcus.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> Prolapsed, incarcerated hemorrhoids are extremely painful, whereas as long as a rectal prolapse is not strangulated, it gives little pain and is easy to reduce.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" />

The prolapse may be obvious, or it may require straining and squatting to produce it.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> The anus is usually patulous, (loose, open) and has reduced resting and squeeze pressures.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> Sometimes it is necessary to observe the patient while they strain on a toilet to see the prolapse happen<ref name="Yamada GI textbook" /> (the perineum can be seen with a mirror or by placing an endoscope in the bowel of the toilet).<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> A phosphate enema may need to be used to induce straining.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> 

The perianal skin may be macerated (softening and whitening of skin that is kept constantly wet) and show [[excoriation]].<ref name="ASCRS textbook" />

===Proctoscopy/sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy===
These may reveal congestion and [[edema]] (swelling) of the distal rectal mucosa,<ref name="Yamada GI textbook" /> and in 10-15% of cases there may be a solitary rectal ulcer on the anterior rectal wall.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> Localized inflammation or ulceration can be biopsied, and may lead to a diagnosis of SRUS or colitis cystica profunda.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> Rarely, a [[neoplasia|neoplasm]] (tumour) may form on the leading edge of the intussusceptum. In addition, patients are frequently elderly and therefore have increased incidence of [[colorectal cancer]]. Full length colonoscopy is usually carried out in adults prior to any surgical intervention.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> These investigations may be used with contrast media ([[barium enema]]) which may show the associated mucosal abnormalities.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" />

===Videodefecography===
This investigation is used to diagnose internal intussusception, or demonstrate a suspected external prolapse that could not be produced during the examination.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> It is usually not necessary with obvious external rectal prolapse.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> [[Defecography]] may demonstrate associated conditions like [[cystocele]], vaginal vault prolapse or [[enterocele]].<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" />

===Colonic transit studies===
[[Colonic transit studies]] may be used to rule out [[colonic inertia]] if there is a history of severe constipation.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /><ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> Continent prolapse patients with slow transit constipation, and who are fit for surgery may benefit from subtotal colectomy with rectopexy.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" />

===Anorectal manometry===
This investigation objectively documents the functional status of the sphincters. However, the clinical significance of the findings are disputed by some.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> It may be used to assess for pelvic floor dyssenergia,<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> ([[anismus]] is a contraindication for certain surgeries, e.g. STARR), and these patients may benefit from post-operative [[biofeedback]] therapy. Decreased squeeze and resting pressures are usually the findings, and this may predate the development of the prolapse.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> Resting tone is usually preserved in patients with mucosal prolapse.<ref name="Yamada GI textbook" /> In patients with reduced resting pressure, levatorplasty may be combine with prolapse repair to further improve continence.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" />

===Anal electromyography/Pudendal nerve testing===
May be used to evaluate incontinence, but there is disagreement about what relevance the results may show, as rarely do they mandate a change of surgical plan.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> There may be denervation of striated musculature on the electromyogram.<ref name="Yamada GI textbook" /> Increased nerve conduction periods (nerve damage), this may be significant in predicting post-operative incontinence.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" />

==Complete (external) rectal prolapse==
[[File:Rectal prolaps.jpg|thumbnail|right|A severe example of complete (external) rectal prolapse. Note circumferential arrangement of mucosal folds.]]

Rectal prolapse is a “ falling down” of the rectum so that it is visible externally. The appearance is of a reddened, proboscis-like object through the anal sphincters. Patients find the condition embarrassing.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> The symptoms can be socially debilitating without treatment,<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> but it is rarely life threatening.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> 

The true incidence of rectal prolapse is unknown, but it is thought to be uncommon. As most sufferers are elderly, the condition is generally under-reported.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Professional Guide to Diseases |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |year=2008 |page=294 |isbn=978-0-7817-7899-2}}</ref> It may occur at any age, even in children,<ref name="pmid17194301">{{cite journal |author=Saleem MM, Al-Momani H |title=Acute scrotum as a complication of Thiersch operation for rectal prolapse in a child |journal=BMC Surg |volume=6|page=19 |year=2006 |pmid=17194301 |pmc=1785387 |doi=10.1186/1471-2482-6-19 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2482/6/19}}</ref> but there is peak onset in the fourth and seventh decades.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> Women over 50 are six times more likely to develop rectal prolapse than men.

[et|title=Textbook of gastroenterology|year=2009|publisher=Blackwell Pub.|location=Chichester, West Sussex|isbn=978-1-4051-6911-0|page=1725|edition=5th ed.}}</ref> When males are affected, they tend to be young and report significant bowel function symptoms, especially [[obstructed defecation]],<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> or have a predisposing disorder (e.g., congenital [[anal atresia]]).<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> When children are affected, they are usually under the age of 3.

35% of women with rectal prolapse have never had children,<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> suggesting that pregnancy and labour are not significant etiological factors. Anatomical differences such as the wider pelvic outlet in females may explain the skewed gender distribution.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" />

Associated conditions, especially in younger patients include autism, developmental delay syndromes and psychiatric conditions requiring several medications.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" />

===Signs & Symptoms===
Signs and symptoms include:
* history of a protruding mass.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" />
* degrees of [[fecal incontinence]], (50-80% of patients)<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /><ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> which may simply present as a [[rectal discharge|mucous discharge]].<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" />
* [[constipation]]<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> (20-50% of patients)<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> also described as [[tenesmus]] (a sensation of incomplete evacuation of stool) and [[obstructed defecation]].<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" />
* a feeling of bearing down.<ref name="Yamada GI textbook" />
* [[rectal bleeding]]<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" />
* [[diarrhea]]<ref name="Yamada GI textbook" /> and erratic bowel habits.

Initially, the mass may protrude through the anal canal only during defecation and straining, and spontaneously return afterwards. Later, the mass may have to be pushed back in following defecation. This may progress to a chronically prolapsed and severe condition, defined as spontaneous prolapse that is difficult to keep inside, and occurs with walking, prolonged standing,<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> coughing or sneezing ([[Valsalva]] maneuvers).<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> A chronically prolapsed rectal tissue may undergo pathological changes such as thickening, ulceration and bleeding.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" />

If the prolapse becomes trapped externally outside the anal sphincters, it may become strangulated and there is a risk of perforation.<ref name="Yamada GI textbook" />  This may require an urgent surgical operation if the prolapse cannot be manually reduced.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> Applying granulated sugar on the exposed rectal tissue can reduce the [[edema]] (swelling) and facilitate this.<ref name="Yamada GI textbook" />

===Etiopathology===
[[File:Rectal prolapse - low mag.jpg|400px|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] showing a rectal wall with changes seen in rectal prolapse. There is a marked increase of fibrous tissue in the submucosa and fibrous tissue +/- smooth muscle [[hyperplasia]] in the [[lamina propria]]. [[H&E stain]]]]

The precise cause is unknown,<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /><ref name="ASCRS textbook" /><ref name=Coloproctology /> and has been much debated.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> In 1912 Moschcowitzl proposed that rectal prolapse was a sliding hernia through a pelvic [[fascia]]l defect.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" />

This theory was based on the observation that rectal prolapse patients have a mobile and unsupported pelvic floor, and a hernia sac of peritoneum from the Pouch of Douglas and rectal wall can be seen.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" />  Other adjacent structures can sometimes be seen in addition to the rectal prolapse.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> Although a [[pouch of Douglas]] [[hernia]], originating in the cul de sac of Douglas, may protrude from the anus (via the anterior rectal wall),<ref name="Yamada GI textbook" /> this is a different situation from rectal prolapse.

Shortly after the invention of [[defecography]], In 1968 Broden and Snellman used [[defecography|cinedefecography]] to show that rectal prolapse begins as a circumferential intussusception of the rectum,<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /><ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> which slowly increases over time.<ref name="Yamada GI textbook" /> The leading edge of the intussusceptum may be located at 6–8&nbsp;cm or at 15–18&nbsp;cm from the [[anal verge]].<ref name="Yamada GI textbook" /> This proved an older theory from the 18th century by [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] and [[Albrecht von Haller]] that this condition is essentially a full-thickness rectal intussusception, beginning about 3 inches above the [[dentate line]] and protruding externally.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" />

Since most patients with rectal prolapse have a long history of constipation,<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> it is thought that prolonged, excessive and repetitive straining during defecation may predispose to rectal prolapse.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /><ref name=Coloproctology /><ref name="Yamada GI textbook" /><ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Turell | first1 = R. | title = Sexual problems as seen by proctologist. | journal = N Y State J Med | volume = 74 | issue = 4 | pages = 697–8 | month = Apr | year = 1974 | doi =  | pmid = 4523440 }}</ref><ref>Essential Revision Notes in Surgery for Medical Students By Irfan Halim; p139</ref><ref name="Hampton-2009">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hampton | first1 = BS. | title = Pelvic organ prolapse. | journal = Med Health R I | volume = 92 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–9 | month = Jan | year = 2009 | doi =  | pmid = 19248418 }}</ref> Since rectal prolapse itself causes functional obstruction, more straining may result from a small prolapse, with increasing damage to the anatomy.<ref name=Coloproctology /> This excessive straining may be due to predisposing pelvic floor dysfunction (e.g. [[obstructed defecation]]) and anatomical factors:<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /><ref name="Yamada GI textbook" />

The association with uterine prolapse (10-25%) and cystocele (35%) may suggest that there is some underlying abnormality of the pelvic floor that affects multiple pelvic organs.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> Proximal bilateral pudendal neuropathy has been demonstrated in patients with rectal prolapse who have fecal incontinence.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> This finding was shown to be absent in healthy subjects, and may be the cause of denervation-related atrophy of the external anal sphincter. Some authors suggest that [[pudendal nerve]] damage is the cause for pelvic floor and anal sphincter weakening, and may be the underlying cause of a spectrum of pelvic floor disorders.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" />

Sphincter function in rectal prolapse is almost always reduced.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> This may be the result of direct sphincter injury by chronic stretching of the prolapsing rectum. Alternatively, the intussuscepting rectum may lead to chronic stimulation of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR - contraction of the external anal sphincter in response to stool in the rectum). The RAIR was shown to be absent or blunted. Squeeze (maximum voluntary contraction) pressures may be effected as well as the resting tone. This is most likely a denervation injury to the external anal sphincter.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> 

The assumed mechanism of [[fecal incontinence]] in rectal prolapse is by the chronic stretch and trauma to the anal sphincters and the presence of a direct conduit (the intussusceptum) connecting rectum to the external environment which is not guarded by the sphincters.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" />   

The assumed mechanism of obstructed defecation is by disruption to the rectum and anal canal's ability to contract and fully evacuate rectal contents. The intussusceptum itself may mechanically obstruct the rectoanal [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]], creating a blockage that straining, anismus and colonic dysmotility exacerbate.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" />  

Some believe that internal rectal intussusception represents the initial form of a progressive spectrum of disorders the extreme of which is external rectal prolapse. The intermediary stages would be gradually increasing sizes of intussusception. However, internal intussusception rarely progresses to external rectal prolapse.<ref name="Mellgren 1997">{{cite journal|last=Mellgren|first=A|coauthors=Schultz, I; Johansson, C; Dolk, A|title=Internal rectal intussusception seldom develops into total rectal prolapse.|journal=Diseases of the colon and rectum|date=1997 Jul|volume=40|issue=7|pages=817–20|pmid=9221859}}</ref> The factors that result in a patient progressing from internal intussusception to a full thickness rectal prolapse remain unknown.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> Defecography studies demonstrated that degrees of internal intussusception are present in 40% of asymptomatic subjects, raising the possibility that it represents a normal variant in some, and may predispose patients to develop symptoms, or exacerbate other problems.<ref name="Shorvon 1989">{{cite journal|last=Shorvon|first=PJ|coauthors=McHugh, S; Diamant, NE; Somers, S; Stevenson, GW|title=Defecography in normal volunteers: results and implications.|journal=Gut|date=1989 Dec|volume=30|issue=12|pages=1737–49|pmid=2612988}}</ref>

===Treatment===

====Conservative====
The only potentially curative treatment for complete rectal prolapse is surgery,<ref name="Tou 2008 (cochrane)" /> however in those patients with medical problems that make them unfit for surgery, and those patients who have minimal symptoms, conservative measures may benefit. Dietary adjustments, including increasing dietary fiber may be beneficial to reduce constipation,<ref name="Tou 2008 (cochrane)" /> and thereby reduce straining. A bulk forming agent (e.g. [[psyllium]]) or stool softener can also reduce constipation. Biofeedback retraining may be indicated to help the patient avoid straining during defecation. There is limited evidence that [[hypopressive exercise]]s may be beneficial in mild pelvic organ prolapse.

====Surgical====
Surgery is often required to prevent further damage to the anal sphincters. The goals of surgery are to restore the normal anatomy and to minimize symptoms. There is no globally agreed consensus as to which procedures are more effective,<ref name="Tou 2008 (cochrane)" /> and there have been over 50 different operations described.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> 

Surgical approaches in rectal prolapse can be either perineal or abdominal. A perineal approach (or trans-perineal) refers to surgical access to the rectum and sigmoid colon via incision around the anus and [[perineum]] (the area between the genitals and the anus).<ref name="Encyclopedia of Surgery">{{cite web|last=Sherk|first=Stephanie Dionne|title=Rectal prolapse repair on Encyclopedia of Surgery|url=http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Pa-St/Rectal-Prolapse-Repair.html#b|publisher=Encyclopedia of Surgery|accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref> Abdominal approach (trans-abdominal approach) involves the surgeon cutting into the [[abdomen]] and gaining surgical access to the [[pelvic cavity]]. Procedures for rectal prolapse may involve fixation of the bowel (rectopexy), or resection (a portion removed), or both.<ref name="Tou 2008 (cochrane)" /> Trans-anal (endo-anal) procedures are also described where access to the internal rectum is gained through the anus itself.

=====Abdominal procedures=====
The abdominal approach carries a small risk of impotence in males (e.g. 1-2% in abdominal rectopexy).<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> Abdominal operations may be open or [[laparoscopic surgery|laparoscopic]] (keyhole surgery).<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" />

'''Laproscopic procedures'''
Recovery time following laparoscopic surgery is shorter and less painful than following traditional abdominal surgery.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Surgery" /> Instead of opening the pelvic cavity with a wide incision (laparotomy), a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) and surgical instruments are inserted into the pelvic cavity via small incisions.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Surgery" /> Rectopexy and anterior resection have been performed laparoscopically with good results.

=====Perineal procedures=====
The perineal approach generally results in less post-operative pain and complications, and a reduced length of hospital stay. These procedures generally carry a higher recurrence rate and poorer functional outcome.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> The perineal procedures include perineal rectosigmoidectomy and Delorme repair.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> Elderly, or other medically high-risk patients are usually treated by perineal procedures,<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" />  as they can be performed under a [[regional anesthesia|regional anesthetic]], or even [[local anesthetic]] with [[intravenous sedation]], thus avoid the risks of a [[general anesthetic]].<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> Alternatively, perineal procedures may be selected to reduce risk of nerve damage, for example in young male patients for whom sexual dysfunction may be a major concern.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" />

'''Perineal rectosigmoidectomy'''

Perineal rectosigmoidectomy aims to resect (remove) the redundant bowel via the perineum and anchor the lower rectum to the sacrum through fibrosis in the hope of preventing future prolapse.<ref name="Tou 2008 (cochrane)" /> The full thickness of the rectal wall is incised at a level just above the dentate line. Redundant rectal and sigmoid wall is removed and the new edge of colon is reconnected (anastomosed) with the anal canal with stitches or staples.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> This procedure may be combined with a procedure to tighten the pelvic muscles (levatorplasty).<ref name="Tou 2008 (cochrane)" /> A combined a perineal proctosigmoidectomy with anterior levatoroplasty is also called an Altemeier procedure.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> Levatorplasty is performed to correct elvator diastasis which is commonly associated with rectal prolapse.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> Perineal rectosigmoidectomy was first introduced by Mikulicz in 1899, and it remained the preferred treatment in Europe for many years.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> It was Popularized by Altemeier.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> The procedure is simple, safe and effective.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> Continence Levatorplasty may enhance restoration of continence (2/3 of patients).<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> Complications occur in less than 10% of cases, and include pelvic bleeding, pelvic abscess and anastomotic dehiscence (splitting apart of the stitches inside), bleeding or leak at a dehiscence<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> Mortality is low.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> Recurrence rates are higher than for abdominal repair,<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> 16-30%, but more recent studies give lower recurrence rates.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> Additional levatoroplasty  can reduce recurrence rates to 7%.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" />

'''Delorme Procedure'''

This is a modification of the perineal rectosigmoidectomy, differing in that only the mucosa and submucosa are excised from the prolapsed segment, rather than full thickness resection.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> The prolapse is exposed if it is not already present, and the mucosal and submucosal layers are stripped from the redundant length of bowel. The muscle layer that is left is plicated (folded) and placed as a buttress above the pelvic floor.<ref name="Tou 2008 (cochrane)" /> The edges of the mucosal are then stitched back together. "Mucosal proctectomy" was first discussed by Delorme in 1900,<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> now it is becoming more popular again as it has low morbidity and avoids an abdominal incision, while effectively repairing the prolapse.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> The procedure is ideally suited to those patients with full-thickness prolapse limited to partial circumference (e.g., anterior wall) or less-extensive prolapse (perineal rectosigmoidectomy may be difficult in this situation).<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /><ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> Fecal incontinence is improved following surgery (40%–75% of patients).<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /><ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> Post operatively, both mean resting and squeeze pressures were increased.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> Constipation is improved in 50% of cases,<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> but often urgency and tenesmus are created. Complications, including infection, urinary retention, bleeding, [[anastomosis|anastomotic]] dehiscence (opening of the stitched edges inside), stricture (narrowing of the gut lumen), diarrhea, and fecal impaction occur in 6-32% of cases.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /><ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> Mortality occurs in 0-2.5% cases.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> There is a higher recurrence rate than abdominal approaches (7-26% cases).<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /><ref name="ASCRS textbook" />

'''Anal encirclement (Thirsch procedure)'''

This procedure can be carried out under [[local anaesthetic]]. After reduction of the prolapse, a subcutaneous suture (a stich under the skin) or other material is placed encircling the anus, which is then made taut to prevent further prolapse.<ref name="Tou 2008 (cochrane)" /> Placing silver wire around the anus first described by Thiersch in 1891.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> Materials used include nylon, silk, silastic rods, silicone, Marlex mesh, Mersilene mesh, fascia, tendon, and Dacron.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> This operation does not correct the prolapse itself, it merely supplements the anal sphincter, narrowing the anal canal with the aim of preventing the prolapse from becoming external, meaning it remains in the rectum.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> This goal is achieved in 54-100% cases. Complications include breakage of the encirclement material, fecal impaction, sepsis, and erosion into the skin or anal canal. Recurrence rates are higher that the other perineal procedures. This procedure is generally reserved for debilitated or other individuals at high anesthetic risk,<ref name="Tou 2008 (cochrane)" /> who may not tolerate other perineal procedures.

==Internal rectal intussusception==

'''Internal rectal intussusception''' (rectal intussusception, internal intussusception, internal rectal prolapse, occult rectal prolapse, internal rectal [[procidentia]] and rectal invagination) is a medical condition defined as a funnel shaped infolding of the [[rectal]] wall that can occur during [[defecation]].<ref name="Coloproctology"/> 

This phenomenon was first described in the late 1960s when [[defecating proctogram|defecagraphy]] was first developed and became widespread.<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" /> Degrees of internal intussusception have been demonstrated in 40% of asymptomatic subjects, raising the possibility that it represents a normal variant in some, and may predispose patients to develop symptoms, or exacerbate other problems.<ref name="Shorvon 1989"/>

===Symptoms===

Internal intussusception may be [[asymptomatic]], but common symptoms include:<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> 

* [[Fecal leakage]] <ref>{{cite journal|last=Portier|first=G|coauthors=Kirzin, S; Cabarrot, P; Queralto, M; Lazorthes, F|title=The effect of abdominal ventral rectopexy on faecal incontinence and constipation in patients with internal intra-anal rectal intussusception.|journal=Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland|date=2011 Aug|volume=13|issue=8|pages=914–7|pmid=20497199}}</ref>

* Pelvic pain.<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" />
* [[Rectal bleeding]].<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" />

'''Recto-rectal''' intussusceptions may be [[asymptomatic]], apart from mild obstructed defecation. "interrupted defaecation" in the morning is thought by some to be characteristic.<ref name="Obstructed defecation web" />

'''Recto-anal''' intussusceptions commonly give more severe symptoms of straining, incomplete evacuation, need for digital evacuation of stool, need for support of the [[perineum]] during defecation, urgency, frequency or intermittent [[fecal incontinence]].<ref name="Obstructed defecation web" /> 

It has been observed that intussusceptions of thickness ≥3&nbsp;mm, and those that appear to cause obstruction to rectal evacuation may give clinical symptoms.<ref name=weiss>{{cite journal|last=Weiss|first=EG|coauthors=McLemore, EC|title=Functional disorders: rectoanal intussusception.|journal=Clinics in colon and rectal surgery|date=2008 May|volume=21|issue=2|pages=122–8|pmid=20011408}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Dvorkin|first=LS|coauthors=Gladman, MA; Epstein, J; Scott, SM; Williams, NS; Lunniss, PJ|title=Rectal intussusception in symptomatic patients is different from that in asymptomatic volunteers.|journal=The British journal of surgery|date=2005 Jul|volume=92|issue=7|pages=866–72|pmid=15898121}}</ref>

===Etiology===

There are 2 schools of thought regarding the nature of internal intussusception, viz: whether it is a primary phenomenon, or secondary (a consequence) to another condition.

Some believe that it represents the initial form of a progressive spectrum of disorders the extreme of which is external rectal prolapse. The intermediary stages would be gradually increasing sizes of intussusception. The folding section of rectum can cause repeated trauma to the mucosa, and can cause [[solitary rectal ulcer syndrome]].<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> However, internal intussusception rarely progresses to external rectal prolapse.<ref name="Mellgren 1997" /> 

Others argue that the majority of patients appear to have rectal intussusception as a consequence of obstructed defecation rather than a cause,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Christiansen|first=J|coauthors=Zhu, BW; Rasmussen, OO; Sørensen, M|title=Internal rectal intussusception: results of surgical repair.|journal=Diseases of the colon and rectum|date=1992 Nov|volume=35|issue=11|pages=1026-8; discussion 1028-9|pmid=1425046}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Christiansen|first=J|coauthors=Hesselfeldt, P; Sørensen, M|title=Treatment of internal rectal intussusception in patients with chronic constipation.|journal=Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology|date=1995 May|volume=30|issue=5|pages=470–2|pmid=7638574}}</ref> possibly related to excessive straining in patients with obstructed defecation.<ref name=weiss /> Patients with other causes of obstructed defecation ([[obstructed defecation|outlet obstruction]]) like [[anismus]] also tend to have higher incidence of internal intussusception. [[Enterocele]]s are coexistent in 11% of patients with internal intussusception.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ihre|first=T|coauthors=Seligson, U|title=Intussusception of the rectum-internal procidentia: treatment and results in 90 patients.|journal=Diseases of the colon and rectum|date=1975 Jul-Aug|volume=18|issue=5|pages=391–6|pmid=1149581}}</ref> Symptoms of internal intussusception overlap with those of [[rectocele]], indeed the 2 conditions can occur together.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dvorkin|first=LS|coauthors=Knowles, CH; Scott, SM; Williams, NS; Lunniss, PJ|title=Rectal intussusception: characterization of symptomatology.|journal=Diseases of the colon and rectum|date=2005 Apr|volume=48|issue=4|pages=824–31|pmid=15785903}}</ref>

Patients with [[solitary rectal ulcer syndrome]] combined with internal intussusception (as 94% of SRUS patients have) were shown to have altered rectal wall biomechanics compared to patients with internal intussusception alone.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dvorkin|first=LS|coauthors=Gladman, MA; Scott, SM; Williams, NS; Lunniss, PJ|title=Rectal intussusception: a study of rectal biomechanics and visceroperception.|journal=The American journal of gastroenterology|date=2005 Jul|volume=100|issue=7|pages=1578–85|pmid=15984985}}</ref> The presumed mechanism of the [[obstructed defecation]] is by telescoping of the intussusceptum, occluding the rectal lumen during attempted defecation.<ref name=weiss /> One study analysed resected rectal wall specimens in patients with obstructed defecation associated with rectal intussusception undergoing [[stapled trans-anal rectal resection]]. They reported abnormalities of the [[enteric nervous system]] and [[estrogen receptors]].<ref name=Bassotti>{{cite journal|last=Bassotti|first=G|coauthors=Villanacci, V; Bellomi, A; Fante, R; Cadei, M; Vicenzi, L; Tonelli, F; Nesi, G; Asteria, CR|title=An assessment of enteric nervous system and estroprogestinic receptors in obstructed defecation associated with rectal intussusception.|journal=Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society|date=2012 Mar|volume=24|issue=3|pages=e155-61|pmid=22188470}}</ref> One study concluded that intussusception of the [[anterior (anatomy)|anterior]] rectal wall shares the same cause as [[rectocele]], namely deficient recto-vaginal ligamentous support.<ref name="Abendstein 2008">{{cite journal|last=Abendstein|first=B|coauthors=Petros, PE; Richardson, PA; Goeschen, K; Dodero, D|title=The surgical anatomy of rectocele and anterior rectal wall intussusception.|journal=International urogynecology journal and pelvic floor dysfunction|date=2008 May|volume=19|issue=5|pages=705–10|pmid=18074069}}</ref>

===Comorbidities & complications===
The following conditions occur more commonly in patients with internal rectal intussusception than in the general population:

* [[Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome]].<ref name="Goei 1990" />

===Diagnosis===
Unlike external rectal prolapse, internal rectal intussusception is not visible externally, but it may still be diagnosed by [[digital rectal examination]], while the patient strains as if to defecate.<ref name="Obstructed defecation web"/> Imaging such as a [[defecating proctogram]]<ref name="Goei 1990">{{cite journal|last=Goei|first=R|coauthors=Baeten, C|title=Rectal intussusception and rectal prolapse: detection and postoperative evaluation with defecography.|journal=Radiology|date=1990 Jan|volume=174|issue=1|pages=124–6|pmid=2294538}}</ref> or dynamic MRI defecography can demonstrate the abnormal folding of the rectal wall. Some have advocated the use of anorectal physiology testing ([[anorectal manometry]]).<ref name="ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS" />

===Treatment===

Non surgical measures to treat internal intussusception include a [[Laxative#Bulk forming agent|bulking agent]] (e.g. [[psyllium]]), [[suppositories]] or [[enemas]] to relieve constipation and straining.<ref name="Yamada GI textbook"/> If there is [[fecal incontinence|incontinence]] ([[fecal leakage]] or more severe FI), or paradoxical contraction of the pelvic floor ([[anismus]]), then biofeedback retraining is indicated.<ref name=ascrs>{{cite web|last=Donald|first=Kim|title=Prolapse and intussusception|url=http://www.fascrs.org/physicians/education/core_subjects/2000/prolapse_and_intussusception/|publisher=ASCRS|accessdate=8 July 2012}}</ref> Some researchers advise that internal intussusception be managed conservatively, compared to external rectal prolapse which usually requires surgery.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Felt-Bersma|first=RJ|coauthors=Tiersma, ES; Cuesta, MA|title=Rectal prolapse, rectal intussusception, rectocele, solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, and enterocele.|journal=Gastroenterology clinics of North America|date=2008 Sep|volume=37|issue=3|pages=645–68, ix|pmid=18794001}}</ref> 

As with external rectal prolapse, there are a great many different surgical interventions described. Generally, a section of rectal wall can be [[segmental resection|resected]] (removed), or the rectum can be fixed (rectopexy) to its original position against the [[sacral vertebrae]], or a combination of both methods. Surgery for internal rectal prolapse can be via the abdominal approach or the transanal approach.<ref name="Festen 2010">{{cite journal|last=Festen|first=S.|coauthors=Geloven, A. A. W.; D'Hoore, A.; Lindsey, I.; Gerhards, M. F.|title=Controversy in the treatment of symptomatic internal rectal prolapse: suspension or resection?|journal=Surgical Endoscopy|date=8 December 2010|volume=25|issue=6|pages=2000–2003|doi=10.1007/s00464-010-1501-4}}</ref> 

It is clear that there is a wide spectrum of symptom severity, meaning that some patients may benefit from surgery and others may not. Many procedures receive conflicting reports of success, leading to a lack of any consensus about the best way to manage this problem.<ref name=ascrs /> Relapse of the intussusception after treatment is a problem. Two of the most commonly employed procedures are discussed below.

====laparoscopic ventral (mesh) rectopexy (LVR)====

This procedure aims to "[correct] the descent of the posterior and middle pelvic compartments combined with reinforcement of the rectovaginal septum".<ref name="Festen 2010" /> 

Rectopexy has been shown to improve anal incontinence ([[fecal leakage]]) in patients with rectal intussusception.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lazorthes|first=F|coauthors=Gamagami, R; Cabarrot, P; Muhammad, S|title=Is rectal intussusception a cause of idiopathic incontinence?|journal=Diseases of the colon and rectum|date=1998 May|volume=41|issue=5|pages=602–5|pmid=9593243}}</ref><ref name="Samaranayake 2010" /> The operation has been shown to have low recurrence rate (around 5%).<ref name="Boons 2010" /> It also improves obstructed defecation symptoms.<ref name="Collinson 2010">{{cite journal|last=Collinson|first=R|coauthors=Wijffels, N; Cunningham, C; Lindsey, I|title=Laparoscopic ventral rectopexy for internal rectal prolapse: short-term functional results.|journal=Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland|date=2010 Feb|volume=12|issue=2|pages=97–104|pmid=19788493}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Slawik|first=S|coauthors=Soulsby, R; Carter, H; Payne, H; Dixon, AR|title=Laparoscopic ventral rectopexy, posterior colporrhaphy and vaginal sacrocolpopexy for the treatment of recto-genital prolapse and mechanical outlet obstruction.|journal=Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland|date=2008 Feb|volume=10|issue=2|pages=138–43|pmid=17498206}}</ref>

====Stapled trans-anal rectal resection (STARR)====

==Mucosal prolapse==
'''Rectal mucosal prolapse''' (mucosal prolapse, anal mucosal prolapse) is a sub-type of rectal prolapse, and refers to abnormal descent of the [[rectal]] [[mucosa]] through the [[anus]].<ref name="Yamada GI textbook" /> It is different to an internal intussusception (occult prolapse) or a complete rectal prolapse (external prolapse, procidentia) because these conditions involve the full thickness of the rectal wall, rather than only the mucosa (lining).<ref name="Gupta 2006" />

Mucosal prolapse is a different condition to prolapsing (3rd or 4th degree) [[hemorrhoids]],<ref name="Gupta 2006" /> although they may look similar. 

Rectal mucosal prolapse can be a cause of [[obstructed defecation]] (outlet obstruction).<ref name=Coloproctology /> and [[rectal malodor]].

===Symptoms===
Symptom severity increases with the size of the prolapse, and whether it spontaneously reduces after defecation, requires manual reduction by the patient, or becomes irreducible. The symptoms are identical to advanced hemorrhoidal disease,<ref name="Gupta 2006" /> and include:

* [[Fecal leakage]] causing staining of undergarments
* [[Rectal bleeding]]
* mucous [[rectal discharge]]
* [[Rectal pain]]
* [[Pruritis ani]]

===Etiology===
The condition, along with complete rectal prolapse and [[Rectal prolapse#Internal rectal intussusception|internal rectal intussusception]], is thought to be related to chronic straining during [[defecation]] and [[constipation]].

Mucosal prolapse occurs when the results from loosening of the submucosal attachments (between the mucosal layer and the [[muscularis propria]]) of the [[distal]] [[rectum]].<ref name="ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception" /> The section of prolapsed rectal mucosa can become ulcerated, leading to bleeding.

===Diagnosis===
Mucosal prolapse can be differentiated from a full thickness external rectal prolapse (a complete rectal prolapse) by the orientation of the folds (furrows) in the prolapsed section. In full thickness rectal prolapse, these folds run circumferential. In mucosal prolapse, these folds are radially.<ref name="ASCRS textbook" /> The folds in mucosal prolapse are usually associated with internal hemorrhoids.<ref name="Yamada GI textbook" />

===Treatment===

==Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome & colitis cystica profunda==
'''Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome''' (SRUS, SRU), is a disorder of the [[rectum]] and [[anal canal]], caused by straining and increased pressure during [[defecation]]. This increased pressure causes the anterior portion of the rectal lining to be forced into the anal canal (an [[Rectal prolapse#Internal rectal intussusception|internal rectal intussusception]]). The lining of the rectum is repeatedly damaged by this friction, resulting in [[ulceration]]. SRUS can therefore considered to be a consequence of internal intussusception (a sub type of rectal prolapse), which can be demonstrated in 94% of cases. It may be [[asymptomatic]], but it can cause [[rectal pain]], [[rectal bleeding]], [[rectal malodor]], incomplete evacuation and [[obstructed defecation]] (rectal outlet obstruction).

===Symptoms===
Symptoms include:<ref name=abid>{{cite journal|last=Abid|first=S|coauthors=Khawaja, A; Bhimani, SA; Ahmad, Z; Hamid, S; Jafri, W|title=The clinical, endoscopic and histological spectrum of the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome: a single-center experience of 116 cases.|journal=BMC gastroenterology|date=2012-06-14|volume=12|issue=1|pages=72|pmid=22697798}}</ref><ref name="Yamada GI textbook" /><ref name="mackle" />
* Straining during [[defecation]]
* Mucous [[rectal discharge]]
* [[Rectal bleeding]]
* Sensation of incomplete evacuation ([[tenesmus]])
* [[constipation]], or more rarely [[diarrhea]]
* [[fecal incontinence]] (rarely)

===Prevalence===
The condition is thought to be uncommon. It usually occurs in young adults, but children can be affected too.<ref name=ertem>{{cite journal|last=Ertem|first=D|coauthors=Acar, Y; Karaa, EK; Pehlivanoglu, E|title=A rare and often unrecognized cause of hematochezia and tenesmus in childhood: solitary rectal ulcer syndrome.|journal=Pediatrics|date=2002 Dec|volume=110|issue=6|pages=e79|pmid=12456946}}</ref>

===Etiology===
The essential cause of SRUS is thought to be related to too much straining during defecation. 

Overactivity of the anal sphincter during defecation causes the patient to require more effort to expel stool. This pressure is produced by the modified valsalva manovoure (attempted forced exhalation against a closed glottis, resulting in increased abdominal and intra-rectal pressure). Patiest with SRUS were shown to have higher intra-rectal pressures when straining than healthy controls.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Womack|first=NR|coauthors=Williams, NS; Holmfield, JH; Morrison, JF|title=Pressure and prolapse--the cause of solitary rectal ulceration.|journal=Gut|date=1987 Oct|volume=28|issue=10|pages=1228–33|pmid=3678951}}</ref> SRUS is also associated with prolonged and incomplete evacuation of stool.<ref name=halligan>{{cite journal|last=Halligan|first=S|coauthors=Nicholls, RJ; Bartram, CI|title=Evacuation proctography in patients with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome: anatomic abnormalities and frequency of impaired emptying and prolapse.|journal=AJR. American journal of roentgenology|date=1995 Jan|volume=164|issue=1|pages=91–5|pmid=7998576}}</ref> 

More effort is required because of concomitant [[anismus]], or non-relaxation/paradoxical contraction of [[puborectalis]] (which should normally relax during defecation).<ref name=van>{{cite journal|last=Van Outryve|first=MJ|coauthors=Pelckmans, PA; Fierens, H; Van Maercke, YM|title=Transrectal ultrasound study of the pathogenesis of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome.|journal=Gut|date=1993 Oct|volume=34|issue=10|pages=1422–6|pmid=8244113}}</ref> The increased pressure forces the anterior rectal lining against the contracted puborectalis and frequently the lining prolapses into the anal canal during straining and then returns to its normal position afterwards.  

The repeated trapping of the lining can cause the tissue to become swollen and congested. Ulceration is thought to be caused by resulting poor blood supply ([[ischemia]]), combined with repeated frictional trauma from the prolapsing lining, and exposure to increased pressure are thought to cause ulceration. Trauma from hard stools may also contribute.

The site of the ulcer is typically on the [[anterior]] wall of the [[rectal ampulla]], about 7–10&nbsp;cm from the anus. However, the area may of ulceration may be closer to the anus, deeper inside, or on the lateral or posterior rectal walls. The name "solitary" can be misleading since there may be more than one ulcer present. Furthermore, there is a "preulcerative phase" where there is no ulcer at all.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Madigan|first=MR|coauthors=Morson, BC|title=Solitary ulcer of the rectum.|journal=Gut|date=1969 Nov|volume=10|issue=11|pages=871–81|pmid=5358578}}</ref> 

Pathological specimens of sections of rectal wall taken from SRUS patients show thickening and replacement of muscle with fibrous tissue and excess collagen.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kang|first=YS|coauthors=Kamm, MA; Engel, AF; Talbot, IC|title=Pathology of the rectal wall in solitary rectal ulcer syndrome and complete rectal prolapse.|journal=Gut|date=1996 Apr|volume=38|issue=4|pages=587–90|pmid=8707093}}</ref> Rarely, SRUS can present as polyps in the rectum.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brosens|first=LA|coauthors=Montgomery, EA; Bhagavan, BS; Offerhaus, GJ; Giardiello, FM|title=Mucosal prolapse syndrome presenting as rectal polyposis.|journal=Journal of clinical pathology|date=2009 Nov|volume=62|issue=11|pages=1034–6|pmid=19861563}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Saadah|first=OI|coauthors=Al-Hubayshi, MS; Ghanem, AT|title=Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome presenting as polypoid mass lesions in a young girl.|journal=World journal of gastrointestinal oncology|date=2010-08-15|volume=2|issue=8|pages=332–4|pmid=21160895}}</ref> 

SRUS is therefore associated and with internal, and more rarely, external rectal prolapse.<ref name="halligan" /> Some believe that SRUS represents a spectrum of different diseases with different [[etiologies]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kang|first=YS|coauthors=Kamm, MA; Nicholls, RJ|title=Solitary rectal ulcer and complete rectal prolapse: one condition or two?|journal=International journal of colorectal disease|year=1995|volume=10|issue=2|pages=87–90|pmid=7636379}}</ref> 

Another condition associated with internal intussusception is '''colitis cystica profunda''' (CCF, proctitis cystica profunda), which is [[cystica profunda]] in the rectum. Cystica profunda is characterized by formation of [[mucin]] [[cysts]] in the muscle layers of the gut lining, and it can occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. When it occurs in the rectum, some believe to be an interchangeable diagnosis with SRUS since the [[hitsology|histologic]] features of the conditions overlap.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vora|first=IM|coauthors=Sharma, J; Joshi, AS|title=Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome and colitis cystica profunda--a clinico-pathological review.|journal=Indian journal of pathology & microbiology|date=1992 Apr|volume=35|issue=2|pages=94–102|pmid=1483723}}</ref><ref name="levine">{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=DS|title="Solitary" rectal ulcer syndrome.

===Complications===
Complications are uncommon, but include massive rectal bleeding, ulceration into the prostate gland or formation of a [[Stenosis|stricture]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gilrane|first=TB|coauthors=Orchard, JL; Al-Assaad, ZA|title=A benign rectal ulcer penetrating into the prostate--diagnosis by prostate-specific antigen.|journal=Gastrointestinal endoscopy|date=1987 Dec|volume=33|issue=6|pages=467–8|pmid=2450805}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Tseng|first=CA|coauthors=Chen, LT; Tsai, KB; Su, YC; Wu, DC; Jan, CM; Wang, WM; Pan, YS|title=Acute hemorrhagic rectal ulcer syndrome: a new clinical entity?

===Diagnosis & investigations===
SRUS is commonly misdiagnosed, and the diagnosis is not made for 5–7 years.<ref name="ertem" /> Clinicians may not be familiar with the condition, and treat for Inflammatory bowel disease, or simple constipation.<ref name=black>{{cite journal|last=Blackburn|first=C|coauthors=McDermott, M; Bourke, B|title=Clinical presentation of and outcome for solitary rectal ulcer syndrome in children.|journal=Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition|date=2012 Feb|volume=54|issue=2|pages=263–5|pmid=22266488}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Umar|first=SB|coauthors=Efron, JE; Heigh, RI|title=An interesting case of mistaken identity.|journal=Case reports in gastroenterology|date=2008-09-30|volume=2|issue=3|pages=308–13|pmid=21490861}}</ref>

* drug-induced [[colitis]]
* mucus-producing [[adenocarcinoma]]

[[Defecography]], [[sigmoidoscopy]],  transrectal [[ultrasound]], mucosal [[biopsy]], anorectal [[manometry]] and [[electromyography]] have all been used to diagnose and study SRUS.<ref name="abid" /><ref name="van" /> Some recommend biopsy as essential for diagnosis since ulcerations may not always be present, and others state [[defecography]] as the investigation of choice to diagnose SRUS.<ref name=mackle>{{cite journal|last=Mackle|first=EJ|coauthors=Parks, TG|title=The pathogenesis and pathophysiology of rectal prolapse and solitary rectal ulcer syndrome.|journal=Clinics in gastroenterology|date=1986 Oct|volume=15|issue=4|pages=985–1002|pmid=3536217}}</ref><ref name="levine" /><ref name="black" />

===Treatment===
Although SRUS is not a medically serious disease, it can be the cause of significantly reduced [[quality of life]] for patients. It is difficult to treat, and treatment is aimed at minimizing symptoms.

Stopping straining during bowel movements, by use of [[human defecation postures|correct posture]], [[dietary fiber]] intake (possibly included bulk forming [[laxatives]] such as [[psyllium]]), stool softeners (e.g. [[polyethylene glycol]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bishop|first=PR|coauthors=Nowicki, MJ|title=Nonsurgical Therapy for Solitary Rectal Ulcer Syndrome.|journal=Current treatment options in gastroenterology|date=2002 Jun|volume=5|issue=3|pages=215–223|pmid=12003716}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=van den Brandt-Grädel|first=V|coauthors=Huibregtse, K; Tytgat, GN|title=Treatment of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome with high-fiber diet and abstention of straining at defecation.|journal=Digestive diseases and sciences|date=1984 Nov|volume=29|issue=11|pages=1005–8|pmid=6092015}}</ref> and [[biofeedback]] retraining to coordinate pelvic floor during defecation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jarrett|first=ME|coauthors=Emmanuel, AV; Vaizey, CJ; Kamm, MA|title=Behavioural therapy (biofeedback) for solitary rectal ulcer syndrome improves symptoms and mucosal blood flow.|journal=Gut|date=2004 Mar|volume=53|issue=3|pages=368–70|pmid=14960517}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Vaizey|first=CJ|coauthors=Roy, AJ; Kamm, MA|title=Prospective evaluation of the treatment of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome with biofeedback.|journal=Gut|date=1997 Dec|volume=41|issue=6|pages=817–20|pmid=9462216}}</ref> 

Surgery may be considered, but only if non surgical treatment has failed and the symptoms are severe enough to warrant the intervention. Improvement with surgery is about 55-60%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sitzler|first=PJ|coauthors=Kamm, MA; Nicholls, RJ; McKee, RF|title=Long-term clinical outcome of surgery for solitary rectal ulcer syndrome.|journal=The British journal of surgery|date=1998 Sep|volume=85|issue=9|pages=1246–50|pmid=9752869}}</ref>

Ulceration may persist even when symptoms resolve.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vaizey|first=CJ|coauthors=van den Bogaerde, JB; Emmanuel, AV; Talbot, IC; Nicholls, RJ; Kamm, MA|title=Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome.|journal=The British journal of surgery|date=1998 Dec|volume=85|issue=12|pages=1617–23|pmid=9876062}}</ref>

==Mucosal prolapse syndrome==
A group of conditions known as '''Mucosal prolapse syndrome''' (MPS) has now been recognized. It includes SRUS, rectal prolapse, proctitis cystica profunda, and inflammatory polyps.<ref name="nonaka" /><ref name="abid" /> It is classified as a chronic benign inflammatory disorder. The unifying feature is varying degrees of rectal prolapse, whether internal intussusception (occult prolapse) or external prolapse.
