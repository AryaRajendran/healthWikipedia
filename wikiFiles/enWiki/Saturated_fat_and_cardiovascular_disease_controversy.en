===Review details===
A 2011 systematic review from [[The Cochrane Library]] analyzed 48 studies conducted between 1965 and 2009 and included 65,508 participants. All studies reduced or modified participants’ dietary fat or cholesterol for at least six months by at least 30 percent.  It was found that reducing saturated fat by reducing and/or modifying dietary fat reduced the risk of having a cardiovascular event, such as heart attack, stroke and unplanned heart surgery, by 14 percent. Of the 65,508 participants, 7 percent had a cardiovascular event.

"The findings are suggestive of a small but potentially important reduction in cardiovascular risk on modification of dietary fat, but not reduction of total fat, in longer trials.  Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups, should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturates. The ideal type of unsaturated fat is unclear". In a summary it goes on to say "there are no clear health benefits of replacing saturated fats with starchy foods".<ref name=Hooper2011 />

A 2010 systematic review and meta-analysis of [[randomized controlled trial]]s commissioned by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute found that substitution of poly-unsaturated fat for saturated fat led to a 19% reduction in [[Coronary Heart Disease]].<ref name=Mozaffarian2010 />

In 2010, a [[meta-analysis]] of prospective [[cohort study|cohort studies]] supported by the [[Dairy Management Inc.|National Dairy Council]] including 348,000 subjects found no [[statistically significant]] relationship between [[cardiovascular disease]] and dietary saturated fat.<ref name=Siri-Tarino2010 /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Siri-Tarino PW, Sun Q, Hu FB, Krauss RM |title=Saturated fat, carbohydrate, and cardiovascular disease |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=502–9 |date=March 2010|pmid=20089734 |doi=10.3945/ajcn.2008.26285 |pmc=2824150}}</ref>  This study has been criticized for not using unadjusted data from the cohort studies, potentially [[Funding bias|bias]]ing in the direction of the study's conclusion.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Scarborough P, Rayner M, van Dis I, Norum K |title=Meta-analysis of effect of saturated fat intake on cardiovascular disease: overadjustment obscures true associations |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=458–459 | date=August 2010 |pmid=20534750 | doi= 10.3945/ajcn.2010.29504}}</ref>  One of the authors of this study received funding from [[Unilever]], a producer of margarine, ice cream, and mayonnaise products.

In a subordinate meta-analysis to a 2009 risk assessment supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an ischemic heart disease mortality residual risk of 1.05 was determined for the 30-44 year age group for each 1% isocaloric reduction in PUFA in favour of SFA.  Higher age groups had lower residual risks.<ref name=Danaei2009 />

In 2009, a [[systematic review]] supported by the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada of prospective cohort studies or randomized trials concluded that there was "insufficient evidence of association" between intake of saturated fatty acids and coronary heart disease, and pointed to strong evidence for protective factors such as vegetables and a [[Mediterranean diet]] and harmful factors such as [[trans fat]]s and foods with a high [[glycemic index]].<ref name=Mente2009 />

A 2009 meta-analysis supported by the NHBLI focused on the effects of trans-fats also applied the same techniques to studies focused on SFA, MUFA and PUFA, in order to assess the relative risk of substituting trans-fats with other fats.  Risks were assessed from two classes of data - risk factors in trials, and disease outcomes in cohort studies.  In order of decreasing risk, the fat types were TFA, SFA, MUFA and PUFA.  From the trials analysis, it was found that for partially hydrogenated vegetable oil with 20% trans-fats at consumption rate of 7.5% of daily calories, replacement with butter would decrease risk by 2.7% and replacement with canola oil would reduce risk by 9.9%.  From the cohort analysis, butter would have little net effect (0.5% increased risk) while soybean and canola oil would have the largest reduction in risk (19.0 and 21.8%, respectively).<ref name=Mozaffarian2009>{{cite journal | journal = European Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 63  |  pages = S22–S33  |  supplement = Suppl. 2   | month = May | year = 2009 | last1 =  Mozaffarian | first1 = D | last2 = Clarke | first2 = R | title = Quantitative effects on cardiovascular risk factors and coronary heart disease risk of replacing partially hydrogenated vegetable oils with other fats and oils | url = http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v63/n2s/pdf/1602976a.pdf | accessdate = 2011-03-22 | doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602976 | pmid = 19424216}}</ref>

A 2009 meta-analysis of cohort studies and randomized controlled trials from the University of Otago, New Zealand, found that the results of the cohort studies showed no association between coronary heart disease mortality nor total coronary heart disease events when saturated fat was increased in place of carbohydrates.  In the randomized controlled trials where the ratio of polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat had been increased, the risk of coronary heart disease fatality was not changed, but the risk of total coronary heart disease events was decreased.  The analysis was critical of the limitations of the primary evidence available, considering the evidence from cohort studies to be mostly unreliable.<ref name=Skeaff2009 />

A 2009 pooled analysis of 11 cohort studies supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, the Danish Heart Foundation and the Danish Medical Research Council found that substituting polyunsaturated fatty acids in place of saturated fatty acids at a rate of 5%  of energy intake led to 13% decrease in coronary events and a 26% decrease in coronary deaths.<ref name=Jakobsen2009 />

The American Dietetic Association's 2008 systematic review found that a diet with 25%-35% total fat but less than 7% saturated fat and [[trans fat]] lowers the risk of coronary heart disease.<ref name=VanHorn2008 />

A 2003 meta-analysis of prevention dietetic studies found the benefit of a modified fat diet in primary prevention is potentially significant if it is maintained for a sufficient length of time.<ref name=Chanu2003 />

A 1999 review found that substitution of the fat from one ounce of nuts for equivalent energy from saturated fat was associated with a 45% reduction in risk of coronary heart disease.<ref name=Hu1999 />

A 1994 meta-analysis from the University of Sydney of the effect on coronary events and total mortality in dietary intervention trials found a 6% reduction in mortality and 13% reduction in events.  The dietary advice differed between the trials reviewed, but most prescribed a reduced saturated fat and cholesterol intake with partial replacement by polyunsaturated oils.  The review noted that a large controlled trial "may no longer be ethical."<ref name=Truswell1994 />

Some meta-analyses have found a significant relationship between saturated fat and serum cholesterol levels, and serum cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease. However, the ratio of total to [[high density lipoprotein]] cholesterol is considered a better indicator and some saturated fats ([[lauric acid]] and [[stearic acid]]) improve the ratio.<ref name=Clarke1997>{{Cite journal|pmid=9006469 |year=1997 |last1=Clarke |first1=R |last2=Frost |last3=Collins |last4=Appleby |last5=Peto |title=Dietary lipids and blood cholesterol: quantitative meta-analysis of metabolic ward studies |volume=314 |issue=7074 |pages=112–7 |journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.) |first2=C |first3=R |first4=P |first5=R |pmc=2125600}}</ref><ref name=Mensink2003>{{cite journal | title = Effects of dietary fatty acids and carbohydrates on the ratio of serum total to HDL cholesterol and on serum lipids and apolipoproteins: a meta-analysis of 60 controlled trials | url=http://www.ajcn.org/content/77/5/1146.full?ijkey=846a72387ebc0d82545acd5442a0c3a9e9fc3566 | journal =American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | author = Mensink RP, Zock PL, Kester ADM, Katan MB | volume=77 | issue=5 | pages = 1146–1155 | month = May | year = 2003 | issn = 0002-9165|pmid=12716665}}</ref><ref name=Lewington2007>{{cite journal | author = Lewington S, Whitlock G, Clarke R, Sherliker P, Emberson J, Halsey J, Qizilbash N, Peto R, Collins R | title = Blood cholesterol and vascular mortality by age, sex, and blood pressure: a meta-analysis of individual data from 61 prospective studies with 55,000 vascular deaths | journal = Lancet | volume = 370 | issue = 9602 | pages = 1829–39 | year = 2007 | month = December | pmid = 18061058 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61778-4 | url = | issn = }}</ref>

===Mainstream authorities===

====Specialist/professional textbooks====

The 2009 ''European Society of Cardiology Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine'' states that in cohort studies the positive relationship between fat intake and CVDs was linked to their saturated fatty acid content.<ref>{{cite book | page = 257 | title = The European Society of Cardiology Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine | last1 = Camm | first1 = John | last2 = Luscher | first2 = Thomas | last3 = Serruys | first3 = Patrick | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | year = 2009 |isbn = 978-0-19-957285-4}}</ref>

According to the 2007 ''Critical Pathways in Cardiovascular Medicine'', substituting unsaturated fat for saturated fat may lower LDL cholesterol without simultaneously lowering HDL cholesterol. This dietary principle partly underlies the Mediterranean style of diet, which has been associated with reduced cardiovascular event rates in two randomized controlled trials.<ref>{{cite book | title = Critical Pathways in Cardiovascular Medicine, 2nd Edition | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | last1 = Cannon | first1 = Christopher | last2 = O'Gara | first2 = Patrick | year = 2007 | page = 243}}</ref>

The 2003 second edition of ''Evidence-based Cardiology'' in 'PartII:  Prevention of cardiovascular diseases' recommends a low intake of SFA, less than 7% of daily calories, and intake of foods rich in myristic and palmitic acids should be especially reduced.  The recommendation was evaluated to be supported by the best grade of available evidence.<ref>{{cite book | title = Evidence-based Cardiology, Second edition | year = 2003 | publisher = BMJ Books | isbn = 0-7279-1699-8 | page = 320 | author = Yusuf, S et al}}</ref>

====Position statements and guidelines of major health organizations====

=====Medical establishments=====

In 2003 a [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) expert consultation report concluded that "intake of saturated fatty acids is directly related
to cardiovascular risk. The traditional target is to restrict the intake of
saturated fatty acids to less than 10%, of daily energy intake and less
than 7% for high-risk groups. If populations are consuming less than
10%, they should not increase that level of intake. Within these limits,
intake of foods rich in myristic and palmitic acids should be replaced by
fats with a lower content of these particular fatty acids. In developing
countries, however, where energy intake for some population groups
may be inadequate, energy expenditure is high and body fat stores are
low (BMI <18.5 kg/m2). The amount and quality of fat supply has to be
considered keeping in mind the need to meet energy requirements.
Specific sources of saturated fat, such as coconut and palm oil, provide
low-cost energy and may be an important source of energy for the poor."<ref>{{cite book | url = http://www.who.int/hpr/NPH/docs/who_fao_expert_report.pdf | title = Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases (WHO technical report series 916) | publisher = World Health Organization | author = Joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation | year = 2003 | pages=81–94 | isbn = 92-4-120916-X | accessdate = 2011-03-11}}</ref>

In its 2007 guidelines, the [[European Society of Cardiology]] states that there are strong, consistent, and graded relationships between saturated fat intake, blood cholesterol levels, and the mass occurrence of cardiovascular disease.  The relationships are accepted as causal.<ref>{{cite journal | author = European Society of Cardiology | journal = European Heart Journal | year = 2007 | url = http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2007/08/28/eurheartj.ehm316.full.pdf | volume = 28 | pages = 2375–2414 | title = European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice: executive summary | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/ehm316 | issue = 19 | pmid = 17726041}}</ref>

The [[Mayo Clinic]] considers saturated fats potentially harmful and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats potentially helpful.  It references the ''Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010'' and recommends reducing foods rich in saturated fat and emphasizing options with more monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fat/NU00262 Dietary fats: Know which types to choose] Mayo Clinic website</ref>

The [[British Dietetic Association]] guidelines found good evidence in systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials that reducing saturated fat reduces morbidity in patients with CVD.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Dietetic guidelines on food and nutrition in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease – evidence from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (second update, January 2006) | journal = Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 401–419 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-277X.2006.00726.x | author = Mead, A et al. | month = December | year = 2006 | pmid = 17105538}}</ref>

=====Governmental guidelines=====

''The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010'' produced by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) and [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] says the human body makes more than enough saturated fats to meet its needs and does not require more from dietary sources.

===Editorial, commentary and conference findings in medical journals===

A May 2011 extended feature in the ''Journal of the American Dietetic Association'' published an edited summary of a debate at the American Dietetic Association's 93rd conference.  Regarding saturated fat, the key point agreed upon by the panel and [[scientific community]] at large was that "Researchers agree that replacing saturated fat with healthy PUFAs is beneficial for health and [cardiovascular disease]."  Recommendations for dieticians emphasized using mono- and poly-unsaturated fats whenever possible, avoiding trans fats, that while "The evidence against saturated fat may not be as strong as dietary guidelines have interpreted [it is clear] that PUFAs (especially) and MUFAs are healthy fats", and that while there is room for saturated fats within the diet but "[they] should not be viewed as good for you".<ref name = Zelman>{{cite pmid | 21515106}}</ref>

It also noted "dietary patterns are more important than single dietary components" and recommended dietitians "to talk food, not chemicals".<ref name = Zelman/>

A 2010 perspective in the ''American Journal of Clinical Nutrition'' found that the risk of [[coronary heart disease]] (CHD) is reduced when saturated fatty acids are replaced with polyunsaturated fatty acids but no clear benefit in replacing saturated fatty acids with carbohydrates or monounsaturated fatty acids.<ref name=Astrup2011>{{cite journal |title=The role of reducing intakes of saturated fat in the prevention of cardiovascular disease: where does the evidence stand in 2010? |journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume= 93|issue= 4|pages=684–688|date=January 2011 |pmid=21270379 |doi=10.3945/ajcn.110.004622  |url=http://www.ajcn.org/content/93/4/684.full |last2=Dyerberg |first2=J. |last3=Elwood |first3=P. |last4=Hermansen |first4=K. |last5=Hu |first5=F.

In an October 2010 article in the journal ''Nutrition'', the 2010 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report was criticized for the "use of an incomplete body of relevant science; inaccurately representing, interpreting, or summarizing the literature; and drawing conclusions and/or making recommendations that do not reflect the limitations or controversies in the science" stating rather that the evidence associating dietary SFA with increased risk of CVD is inconclusive.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hite Adele H., Richard , Feinman David, Guzman Gabriel E.

A response by Jeremiah Stamler to the 2010 meta-analysis by Siri-Tarino et al.<ref name=Siri-Tarino2010 /> was point-by-point critical of the analysis, stating "The authors are inaccurate in concluding that 'there are few epidemiologic or clinical trial data to support a benefit of replacing saturated fat with carbohydrate.'" and questioned if it was the intent to dissociate themselves from prevailing recommendations, "A vast array of concordant multidisiplinary research evidence is the sound foundation for these recommendations."<ref name=Stamler2010>{{cite journal |author=Stamler J |title=Diet-heart: a problematic revisit  |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=497–99 |date=February 2010 |pmid=20130097 |doi=10.3945/ajcn.2010.29216 |url=http://www.canibaisereis.com/download/stamler-diet-heart-problematic-revisit.pdf}}</ref>

A 2009 review from the University of São Paulo found that the best evidence showed reduced intake of saturated fat decreased risk for coronary heart disease.<ref>{{cite journal | title =Importance of the dietary fat on the prevention and control of metabolic disturbances and cardiovascular disease | journal = Arquivos Brasileiros de Endocrinologia e Metabologia | author = Lottenberg AMP | volume=53 |  issue=5 |  pages=595–607 | month = July | year = 2009 | issn = 0004-2730 | doi =10.1590/S0004-27302009000500012 | pmid =19768250 }}</ref>

A 2009 review from King's College London found that epidemiological evidence suggested a negative influence on vascular function from saturated fat, but that the experimental evidence did not support this convincingly.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Dietary saturated and unsaturated fats as determinants of blood pressure and vascular function  | journal = Nutrition Research Reviews | doi=10.1017/S095442240925846X | month = June | year = 2009 | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages=18–38 | author = Hall WL | pmid = 19243668 }}</ref>

A 2009 scientific conference hosted by the University of Reading (UK) and organized and facilitated by the International Dairy Federation’s Standing Committee on Nutrition and Health found that despite the contribution of dairy products to the saturated fatty acid intake of the diet, there was no clear evidence that dairy food consumption is consistently associated with a higher risk of CVD.<ref>{{cite journal |author=German JB, Gibson RA, Krauss RM, ''et al.'' |title=A reappraisal of the impact of dairy foods and milk fat on cardiovascular disease risk |journal=European Journal of Nutrition |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=191–203 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19259609 |pmc=2695872 |doi=10.1007/s00394-009-0002-5}}</ref>

A 2004 commentary from the Nestle Research Center stated that no randomized clinical trials of low-fat diets or low-saturated fat diets of sufficient duration had been carried out. The influence of varying saturated fatty acid intakes against a background of different individual lifestyles and genetic backgrounds were recommended as the focus in future studies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=German JB, Dillard CJ |title=Saturated fats: what dietary intake? |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=80 |issue=3 |pages=550–9 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15321792 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15321792}}</ref>
Saturated fat intakes may be monitored more closely than were total fat intakes, therefore ignoring the possibility that simply a larger fat intake may lead to a higher risk of coronary diseases. It also suggests that other parameters may be overlooked, such as carbohydrates intakes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Knopp RH, Retzlaff BM |title=Saturated fat prevents coronary artery disease?
