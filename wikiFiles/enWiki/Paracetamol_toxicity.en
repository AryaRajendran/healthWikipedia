'''Paracetamol toxicity''' is caused by excessive use or overdose of the [[analgesic]] drug [[paracetamol]] (called acetaminophen in North America). Mainly causing liver injury, paracetamol toxicity is one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide. In the United States and the United Kingdom it is the most common cause of [[acute liver failure]].<ref name="Larson"/><ref name="Ryder"/>

Many individuals with paracetamol toxicity may have no symptoms at all in the first 24&nbsp;hours following overdose. Others may initially have nonspecific complaints such as vague [[abdominal pain]] and [[nausea]]. With progressive disease, signs of liver failure may develop; these include [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], [[metabolic acidosis|low blood pH]], [[bleeding diathesis|easy bleeding]], and [[hepatic encephalopathy]]. Some will spontaneously resolve, although untreated cases may result in death.

Damage to the liver, or [[hepatotoxicity]], results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [[metabolite]]s, [[NAPQI|''N''-acetyl-''p''-benzoquinoneimine]] (NAPQI)(also known as N-acetylimidoquinone).<ref name="met1">[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2012/08/metabolism-of-paracetamol-acetaminophen-acetanilide-and-phenacetin/ Metabolism of acetaminophen (paracetamol), acetanilide and phenacetin]</ref> NAPQI depletes the liver's natural [[antioxidant]] [[glutathione]] and directly damages cells in the liver, leading to liver failure.<ref name="met1"/> Risk factors for toxicity include excessive chronic alcohol intake, [[fasting]] or [[anorexia nervosa]], and the use of certain drugs such as [[isoniazid]].

Treatment is aimed at removing the paracetamol from the body and replacing glutathione. [[Activated charcoal]] can be used to decrease absorption of paracetamol if the patient presents for treatment soon after the overdose; the antidote [[acetylcysteine]] acts as a precursor for glutathione, helping the body regenerate enough to prevent damage to the liver.<ref name="met1"/> N-acetylcysteine can neutralize NAPQI by itself as well.<ref name="met1"/> A [[liver transplant]] is often required if damage to the liver becomes severe. Patients treated early have a good prognosis, whereas patients that develop major liver abnormalities typically have a poor outcome. Efforts to prevent paracetamol overdose include limiting individual sales of the drug and combining paracetamol with [[methionine]], which is converted into glutathione in the liver.

==Toxicity==
The toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4&nbsp;grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10&nbsp;grams or 200&nbsp;mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.<ref name="clintox2006-dart">{{cite journal |author=Dart RC, Erdman AR, Olson KR, Christianson G, Manoguerra AS, Chyka PA, Caravati EM, Wax PM, Keyes DC, Woolf AD, Scharman EJ, Booze LL, Troutman WG; American Association of Poison Control Centers |title=Acetaminophen poisoning: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management |journal=Clinical toxicology (Philadelphia, Pa.) |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |year=2006 |pmid=16496488 |doi= 10.1080/15563650500394571|url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15563650500394571}}</ref><ref name="DalyMJA">{{cite journal |author=Daly FF, Fountain JS, Murray L, Graudins A, Buckley NA |title=Guidelines for the management of paracetamol poisoning in Australia and New Zealand—explanation and elaboration.

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [[nausea]], vomiting, [[pallor]], and [[sweating]].<ref name="pediatrics1975-rumack"/> However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24&nbsp;hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [[metabolic acidosis]] and coma early in the course of poisoning.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zezulka A, Wright N |title=Severe metabolic acidosis early in paracetamol poisoning |journal=British medical journal (Clinical research ed.) |volume=285 |issue=6345 |pages=851–2 |year=1982 |month=September |pmid=6811039 |pmc=1499688 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.285.6345.851|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Roth B, Woo O, Blanc P |title=Early metabolic acidosis and coma after acetaminophen ingestion |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=452–6 |year=1999 |month=April |pmid=10092726 |doi= 10.1016/S0196-0644(99)70312-4|url=}}</ref>

The second phase occurs between 24 and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [[hepatocyte]]s as they metabolize the paracetamol. The individual may experience right-upper-quadrant pain. The increasing liver damage also alters biochemical markers of liver function; [[International normalized ratio]] (INR) and the hepatic [[transaminase]]s [[alanine transaminase]] and [[aspartate transaminase]] rise to abnormal levels.<ref name="Heard-NEJM">{{cite journal |author=Heard KJ |title=Acetylcysteine for Acetaminophen Poisoning |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=359 |issue=3 |pages=285–92 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18635433 |doi=10.1056/NEJMct0708278 |url= |pmc=2637612}}</ref> [[Acute kidney failure]] may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [[hepatorenal syndrome]] or [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome]]. In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.<ref name="clintox2001-boutis">{{cite journal |author=Boutis K, Shannon M |title=Nephrotoxicity after acute severe acetaminophen poisoning in adolescents |journal=Journal of toxicology.

The third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive hepatic [[necrosis]] leading to fulminant hepatic failure with complications of [[coagulation]] defects, [[hypoglycemia]], kidney failure, [[hepatic encephalopathy]], [[cerebral edema]], [[sepsis]], multiple organ failure, and death.<ref name="pediatrics1975-rumack"/> If the third phase is survived, the hepatic necrosis runs its course, and liver and [[Renal physiology|kidney function]] typically return to normal in a few weeks.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Linden CH, Rumack BH |title=Acetaminophen overdose |journal=Emergency medicine clinics of North America |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=103–19 |year=1984 |month=February |pmid=6394298 |url=}}</ref> The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Paracetamol metabolism.svg|thumb|250px|Main pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.]]
When taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.<ref name="Heard-NEJM"/> Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [[Drug metabolism#Phase I vs. Phase II|Phase II metabolism]] by conjugation with [[sulfate]] and [[glucuronide]], with a small portion being oxidized via the [[Cytochrome P450 oxidase|cytochrome P450]] enzyme system.<ref name="met1"/> Cytochromes {{nowrap|P450 [[CYP2E1|2E1]]}} and [[CYP3A4|3A4]] convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly-reactive intermediary metabolite, [[NAPQI|''N''-acetyl-''p''-benzoquinoneimine]] (NAPQI).<ref name="met1"/><ref name="Heard-NEJM"/><ref name="RichardsonJA">{{cite journal |author=Richardson, JA |title=Management of acetaminophen and ibuprofen toxicoses in dogs and cats |journal=Journal of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care|volume=10 |issue= 4|pages=285–291 |year=2000 |month=July–September|doi= 10.1111/j.1476-4431.2000.tb00013.x|url=http://www.aspca.org/site/DocServer/veccs_july00.pdf?docID=132}}</ref><ref name="RumbeihaWK">{{cite journal |author=Rumbeiha WK, Lin YS, Oehme FW |title=Comparison of N-acetylcysteine and methylene blue, alone or in combination, for treatment of acetaminophen toxicosis in cats |journal=American journal of veterinary research |volume=56 |issue=11 |pages=1529–33 |year=1995 |month=November |pmid=8585668}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Corcoran GB, Mitchell JR, Vaishnav YN, Horning EC |title=Evidence that acetaminophen and N-hydroxyacetaminophen form a common arylating intermediate, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine |journal=Molecular Pharmacology |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=536–42 |year=1980 |month=November |pmid=7464816 |url=http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7464816}}</ref> Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [[glutathione]] to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.<ref name="met1"/><ref name="Mitchell">{{cite journal |author=Mitchell JR, Jollow DJ, Potter WZ, Gillette JR, Brodie BB |title=Acetaminophen-induced hepatic necrosis.

In cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.<ref name="Mitchell"/> NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [[Cell membrane|cellular membrane]] molecules, resulting in widespread [[hepatocyte]] damage and death, leading to acute hepatic necrosis.<ref name="met1"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dai Y, Cederbaum AI |title=Cytotoxicity of acetaminophen in human cytochrome P4502E1-transfected HepG2 cells |journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |volume=273 |issue=3 |pages=1497–505 |year=1995 |month=June |pmid=7791125 |url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7791125}}</ref> In animal studies, hepatic glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before hepatotoxicity occurs.<ref name="RichardsonJA"/>

===Risk factors===
A number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [[alcohol consumption and health|alcohol consumption]] can [[enzyme induction and inhibition|induce]] [[CYP2E1]], thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol.<ref name="Hepatology1995-Zimmerman">{{cite journal | author=Zimmerman HJ, Maddrey WC | title=Acetaminophen (paracetamol) hepatotoxicity with regular intake of alcohol: analysis of instances of therapeutic misadventure | journal=Hepatology | year=1995 | pages=767–73 | volume=22 | issue=3 | pmid= 7657281 | doi=10.1002/hep.1840220312}}</ref> Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.<ref name="pmid12137557">{{cite journal |author=Dargan PI, Jones AL |title=Should a lower treatment line be used when treating paracetamol poisoning in patients with chronic alcoholism?: a case against |journal=Drug safety : an international journal of medical toxicology and drug experience |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=625–32 |year=2002 |pmid=12137557}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Buckley NA, Srinivasan J |title=Should a lower treatment line be used when treating paracetamol poisoning in patients with chronic alcoholism?: a case for |journal=Drug safety : an international journal of medical toxicology and drug experience |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=619–24 |year=2002 |pmid=12137556}}</ref> For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.<ref name="pmid12137557"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Schmidt LE, Dalhoff K, Poulsen HE |title=Acute versus chronic alcohol consumption in acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity |journal=Hepatology |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=876–82 |year=2002 |month=April |pmid=11915034 |doi=10.1053/jhep.2002.32148 |url=}}</ref> For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.

[[Fasting]] is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of hepatic glutathione reserves.<ref name="DalyMJA"/> The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inhibitor [[isoniazid]] increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.<ref name="AmJGastroenterol1993-Crippin">{{cite journal |author=Crippin JS |title=Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity: potentiation by isoniazid |journal=The American journal of gastroenterology |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=590–2 |year=1993 |month=April |pmid=8470644}}</ref><ref name="Chest1994-Nolan">{{cite journal | author=Nolan CM, Sandblom RE, Thummel KE, Slattery JT, Nelson SD | title=Hepatotoxicity associated with acetaminophen usage in patients receiving multiple drug therapy for tuberculosis | journal=Chest | year=1994 | pages=408–11 | volume=105 | issue=2 | pmid= 7508362 | doi = 10.1378/chest.105.2.408}}</ref> Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [[carbamazepine]], [[phenytoin]], and [[barbiturate]]s, have also been reported as risk factors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bray GP, Harrison PM, O'Grady JG, Tredger JM, Williams R |title=Long-term anticonvulsant therapy worsens outcome in paracetamol-induced fulminant hepatic failure |journal=Human & Experimental Toxicology |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=265–70 |year=1992 |month=July |pmid=1354974 |doi=10.1177/096032719201100405}}</ref>

According to a preliminary study conducted by the University of Washington, mixing large amounts of both paracetamol and caffeine may cause liver damage. Researchers discovered that caffeine can triple the amount of NAPQI.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,298158,00.html Mixing Tylenol With Caffeine may Increase the Risk of Liver Damage, Study Finds], By Tina Benitez, September 27, 2007, Fox News</ref> This reaction can be caused by large doses of over-the-counter pain relief that combine caffeine and paracetamol. Dr. Sid Nelson, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Washington, said, "Caffeine can interact with an enzyme that can form a toxic metabolite of paracetamol in such a way that it increases the formation of that toxic metabolite."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/26/AR2007092601064.html Caffeine Plus Acetaminophen Toxic for Some], By Steven Reinberg, Washington Post, September 26, 2007</ref> However, the amount of caffeine that was shown to cause the effect in the study was an order of magnitude higher than typical doses experienced by coffee drinkers.

==Diagnosis==
The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [[nomogram]] developed in 1975, called the [[Rumack-Matthew nomogram]], estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.<ref name="pediatrics1975-rumack">{{cite journal | author=Rumack B, Matthew H | title = Acetaminophen poisoning and toxicity | journal=Pediatrics | volume = 55 | issue = 6 | pages = 871–76 | year = 1975 | pmid = 1134886}}</ref> To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.<ref name="DalyMJA"/> A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. Therefore a serum level taken before 4&nbsp;hours is not recommended.<ref name="clintox2006-dart"/>

Clinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12&nbsp;hours.<ref name="emedicine"/> Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of hepatic necrosis with elevated [[aspartate transaminase|AST]], [[alanine transaminase|ALT]], [[bilirubin]], and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [[prothrombin time]].<ref name="Bartlett">{{cite journal |author=Bartlett D |title=Acetaminophen toxicity |journal=Journal of emergency nursing: JEN : official publication of the Emergency Department Nurses Association |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=281–3 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15192687 |doi=10.1016/j.jen.2004.01.023 |url=}}</ref> After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000&nbsp;IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.<ref name="emedicine"/> In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000&nbsp;IU/L.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jones AL |title=Recent advances in the management of late paracetamol poisoning |journal=Emergency medicine Australasia |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=14–21 |year=2000 |month=March|doi=10.1046/j.1442-2026.2000.00088.x |url=}}</ref>

==Detection in body fluids==
Paracetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. Plasma concentrations during therapy usually range from 2-20 mg/L, whereas levels of 30-300 mg/L are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50-400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated colorimetric techniques, gas chromatography and liquid chromatography are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.<ref>Shihana F, Dissanayake D, Dargan P, Dawson A.

Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 9th edition, Biomedical Publications, Seal Beach, CA, 2011, pp. 9-12.</ref>

==Prevention==

===Combination with Other Agents===
One strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [[emetic]]<ref name="Dargan-2003"/> or an antidote.

Paradote is a tablet sold in the UK which combines 500&nbsp;mg paracetamol with 100&nbsp;mg [[methionine]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heptonstall JP |title=Time to make paracetamol with methionine available |journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.) |volume=332 |issue=7544 |pages=795 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16575097 |pmc=1420701 |doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7544.795-b |url=}}</ref> an amino acid formerly<ref name="DalyMJA"/> used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.

There have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.<ref name=Chang_clinical_trial>{{cite web|last=Chang|first=Matthew|title=Acetaminophen in Combination With N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) Versus Placebo in Treating Fever|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01137591|accessdate=17 November 2012}}</ref>

===Limitation of Availability===
Limiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 500&nbsp;mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 500&nbsp;mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hughes B, Durran A, Langford NJ, Mutimer D |title=Paracetamol poisoning—impact of pack size restrictions |journal=Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=307–10 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12911683 |doi= 10.1046/j.1365-2710.2003.00497.x|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0269-4727&date=2003&volume=28&issue=4&spage=307}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sheen CL, Dillon JF, Bateman DN, Simpson KJ, Macdonald TM |title=Paracetamol toxicity: epidemiology, prevention and costs to the health-care system |journal=QJM : monthly journal of the Association of Physicians |volume=95 |issue=9 |pages=609–19 |year=2002 |month=September |pmid=12205339 |doi= 10.1093/qjmed/95.9.609|url=http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12205339}}</ref> In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Laffoy M, Scallan E, Byrne G |title=Paracetamol availability and overdose in Ireland |journal=Irish medical journal |volume=94 |issue=7 |pages=212–4 |year=2001 |pmid=11693213 |url=}}</ref> Subsequent study suggests that these interventions have had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.<ref>BMJ 2013;346:f403, http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f403</ref>

One suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, only 0.08% of the UK population present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.<ref name="Dargan-2003"/> In addition, alternative [[Pain management|pain relief]] medications such as [[aspirin]] are more toxic in overdose, whereas [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jones A |title=Over-the-counter analgesics: a toxicology perspective |journal=Am J Ther |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=245–57 |year=2002 |pmid=11941384 |doi= 10.1097/00045391-200205000-00010|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1075-2765&volume=9&issue=3&spage=245}}</ref>

===Acetaminophen Replacements===
'''Paracetamol ester prodrug with L-pyroglutamic acid (PCA)''', a biosynthetic precursors of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve bioavailability. The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The glutathione hepatic values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in no-treated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significative decrease of gluthathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral LD50 was found to be greater than 2000&nbsp;mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900&nbsp;mg kg-1.

Reducing publicity about paracetamol and  the inclusion of warnings on packs of paracetamol have also been suggested as strategies to reduce overdose.<ref name="Dargan-2003"/>

==Treatment==

===Gastric decontamination===
In adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [[Gastric lavage]], better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60&nbsp;minutes of ingestion.<ref name="jtoxclintox2004-vale">{{cite journal | author=Vale JA, Kulig K; American Academy of Clinical Toxicology; European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists | title=Position paper: gastric lavage | journal=Journal of toxicology.

===Acetylcysteine===
[[Image:Acetylcysteine.svg|thumb|right|[[Acetylcysteine]] is the antidote for paracetamol toxicity]]

[[Acetylcysteine]], also called ''N''-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce paracetamol toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant [[glutathione]]. Glutathione react with the toxic NAPQI metabolite so that it does not damage cells and can be safely excreted.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Piperno E, Berssenbruegge DA |title=Reversal of experimental paracetamol toxicosis with N-acetylcysteine |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=7988 |pages=738–9 |year=1976 |month=October |pmid=61415 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(76)90030-1 }}</ref> [[Cysteamine]] and [[methionine]] have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brok J, Buckley N, Gluud C |title=Interventions for paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |issue=2 |pages=CD003328 |year=2006 |pmid=16625578 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003328.pub2 |url= |editor1-last=Brok |editor1-first=Jesper}}</ref><ref name="methionine">{{cite journal |author=Mant TG, Tempowski JH, Volans GN, Talbot JC |title=Adverse reactions to acetylcysteine and effects of overdose |journal=British medical journal (Clinical research ed.) |volume=289 |issue=6439 |pages=217–9 |year=1984 |month=July |pmid=6234965 |pmc=1442311 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.289.6439.217}}</ref> although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine.<ref name="DalyMJA"/> Additionally, acetylcysteine has been shown to be a more effective antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion.<ref name="overdose_comp">{{cite journal |author=Alsalim W, Fadel M |title=Oral methionine compared with intravenous n-acetyl cysteine for paracetamol overdose |journal=Emergency medicine journal : EMJ |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=366–7 |year=2003 |month=July |pmid=12835357 |pmc=1726135 |doi= 10.1136/emj.20.4.366|url=http://emj.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12835357}}</ref>

If the patient presents less than eight hours after paracetamol overdose, then acetylcysteine significantly reduces the risk of serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival.<ref name="DalyMJA"/> If acetylcysteine is started more than 8&nbsp;hours after ingestion, there is a sharp decline in its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun, and the risk of acute hepatic necrosis and death increases dramatically.

Intravenous acetylcysteine is given as a continuous infusion over 20 hours for a total dose 300&nbsp;mg/kg.

===Liver transplant===
In patients who develop [[fulminant hepatic failure]] or who are otherwise expected to die from liver failure, the mainstay of management is [[liver transplantation]].<ref name="Dargan-2003">{{cite journal |author=Dargan PI, Jones AL |title=Management of paracetamol poisoning |journal=Trends in pharmacological sciences |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=154–7 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12706999 |doi= 10.1016/S0165-6147(03)00053-1|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165614703000531}}</ref> Liver transplants are performed in specialist centers.

==Prognosis==
The [[mortality rate]] from paracetamol overdose increases two days after the ingestion, reaches a maximum on day four, and then gradually decreases. [[Acidosis|Acidemia]] is the most important single indicator of probable mortality and the need for transplantation. A mortality rate of 95% without transplant was reported in patients who had a documented [[pH]] less than 7.30.
