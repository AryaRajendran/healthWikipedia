'''Collectins''' ('''collagen-containing C-type lectins''') are a part of the innate immune system. They form a family of collagenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent defense [[lectins]], which are found in animals. Collectins are soluble [[pattern recognition receptors]] (PRRs). Their function is to bind to oligosaccharide structure or lipids which are on the surface of microorganisms. Like other PRRs they bind [[pathogen-associated molecular patterns]] (PAMPs) and also [[danger-associated molecular patterns]] (DAMPs) of oligosaccharide origin. Binding of collectins to microorganisms may trigger elimination of microorganisms by [[aggregation]], [[complement]] activation, [[opsonization]], activation of [[phagocytosis]] or  inhibition of microbial growth. Other functions of collectins are modulation of [[inflammatory]], [[allergic response]]s, [[adaptive immune system]] and clearance of [[apoptotic cells]].

==Structure==
Functionally collectins are trimers. Monomeric subunit consists of four parts:  
* a [[cysteine]]-rich domain at the N-terminus
* a collagen-like domain
* a [[coiled-coil]] neck domain
* a C-type lectin domain that is also called a [[carbohydrate recognition domain]] (CRD) 
Recognition of specific parts of microorganism is mediated by CRD in presence of calcium.<ref>{{Cite journal

==Types of collectins==
9 types of collectins have been defined to date:
*MBL = [[mannan-binding lectin]] (mannose-binding lectin)
*SP-A = [[surfactant protein A]]
*SP-D = [[surfactant protein D]]
*CL-L1 = [[collectin liver 1]]
*CL-P1 = [[collectin placenta 1]]
*CL-43 = [[conglutinin collectin of 43 kDa]]
*CL-46 = [[collectin of 46 kDa]]
*CL-K1 = [[collectin kidney 1]]
*Conglutinin

CL-43, CL-46 and conglutinin are found in bovine.

==Function==

===Aggregation===
Collectins can bind on the surface of the microorganism and between carbohydrate ligands can be made a bond. Due to those properties the interaction can result into aggregation.<ref>{{Cite journal| issn = 0022-1767| volume = 163| issue = 1| pages = 312–321| last = Ferguson| first = J S| coauthors = D R Voelker, F X McCormack, L S Schlesinger| title = Surfactant protein D binds to Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli and lipoarabinomannan via carbohydrate-lectin interactions resulting in reducedphagocytosis of the bacteria by macrophages| journal = Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md.: 1950)| date = 1999-07-01

===Opsonization and activation of phagocytosis===
Collectins can act as opsonins. There is a specific interaction between collectins and receptors on phagocytic cells which can lead to increased clearance of microorganisms.<ref>{{Cite journal| issn = 1044-1549| volume = 11| issue = 1| pages = 114–122| last = McNeely| first = T B| coauthors = J D Coonrod| title = Aggregation and opsonization of type A but not type B Hemophilus influenzae by surfactant protein A| journal = American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology| date = 1994-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1172/JCI117972| issn = 0021-9738| volume = 95| issue = 6| pages = 2699–2710| last = O'Riordan| first = D M| coauthors = J E Standing, K Y Kwon, D Chang, E C Crouch, A H Limper| title = Surfactant protein D interacts with Pneumocystis carinii and mediates organism adherence to alveolar macrophages| journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation| date = 1995-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1128/IAI.69.1.24-33.2001| issn = 0019-9567| volume = 69| issue = 1| pages = 24–33| last = Ofek| first = I| coauthors = A Mesika, M Kalina, Y Keisari, R Podschun, H Sahly, D Chang, D McGregor, E Crouch| title = Surfactant protein D enhances phagocytosis and killing of unencapsulated phase variants of Klebsiella pneumoniae| journal = Infection and immunity| date = 2001-01}}</ref> MBL can bind to microorganisms and this interaction can lead to opsonization through complement activation,<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1146/annurev.immunol.21.120601.140954| issn = 0732-0582| volume = 21| pages = 547–578| last = Holmskov| first = Uffe| coauthors = Steffen Thiel, Jens C Jensenius| title = Collections and ficolins: humoral lectins of the innate immune defense| journal = Annual review of immunology| year = 2003

SP-A and SP-D can increase permeability of Gram-negative bacterial cell membrane.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1172/JCI16889| issn = 0021-9738| volume = 111| issue = 10| pages = 1589–1602| last = Wu| first = Huixing
