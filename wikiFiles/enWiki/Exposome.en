The '''Exposome''' is a measure of the effects of life-long environmental exposures on health.<ref name = "CDC" /> The term  was first coined by Dr. Christopher Wild, a [[Epidemiology of cancer|cancer epidemiologist]], in a 2005 article entitled, "Complementing the Genome with an “Exposome”: The Outstanding Challenge of Environmental Exposure Measurement in Molecular Epidemiology." <ref>{{cite journal|last=Wild|first=CP|title=Complementing the genome with an "exposome": the outstanding challenge of environmental exposure measurement in molecular epidemiology.|journal=Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology|date=2005 Aug|volume=14|issue=8|pages=1847–50|pmid=16103423|doi=10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-05-0456}}</ref> 

==Background==
In his 2005 article Wild stated, "At its most complete, the exposome encompasses life-course environmental exposures (including lifestyle factors), from the prenatal period onwards." He also stated that even incomplete versions of the exposome could be of great use to field of epidemiology. Wild published a follow-up paper in 2012 where he suggests steps that can be taken to better define the exposome.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wild|first=CP|title=The exposome: from concept to utility|journal=International journal of epidemiology|date=2012 Feb|volume=41|issue=1|pages=24–32|pmid=22296988|doi=10.1093/ije/dyr236}}</ref> 

For complex disorders specific genetic causes appear to only account for 10-30% of the disease incidence, although as [[genomic]] approaches improve this percentage could increase.  Environmental influences contribute to human disease, but unlike with genetics, there is no standard or systematic way to measure the influence of environmental exposures. Some studies, such as those by C. J. Patel [[et al.|''et al'']] into the interaction of genetic and environmental factors in the incidence of [[diabetes]] have demonstrated that environmental-wide association studies (EWAS) may be feasible.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Patel|first=CJ|coauthors=Bhattacharya, J; Butte, AJ|title=An Environment-Wide Association Study (EWAS) on type 2 diabetes mellitus.|journal=PloS one|date=2010 May 20|volume=5|issue=5|pages=e10746|pmid=20505766}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Patel|first=CJ|coauthors=Chen, R; Kodama, K; Ioannidis, JP; Butte, AJ|title=Systematic identification of interaction effects between genome- and environment-wide associations in type 2 diabetes mellitus.|journal=Human genetics|date=2013 Jan 20|pmid=23334806|accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref> However, but it is not clear what data sets are most appropriate to represent the value of "E".<ref>Smith, Martyn T. and  Rappaport, Stephen M.

==Research initiatives==

In 2012, the [[European Commission]] awarded two large-grants to pursue exposome-related research. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/daily-dose-of-toxics-to-be-tracked-1.11901 |title=Daily dose of toxics to be tracked |last1=Callaway|first1=  Ewen |last2= |first2= |date=27 November 2012 |work= |publisher=''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>  The HELIX project at the [[Barcelona]]-based Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology will attempt to develop an early life exposome, noting that the first exposures occur during development. <ref>{{cite web|title=HELIX|url=http://www.creal.cat/programes-recerca/en_projectes-creal/view.php?ID=131|accessdate=21 January 2013}}</ref> The second project, Exposomics, is a consortium based at [[Imperial College London]]. <ref>{{cite web|title=Imperial College News.|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_19-11-2012-10-22-31|accessdate=21 January 2013}}</ref>  This project will use smartphones that utilize GPS and environmental sensors to assess exposures. 

In the US, the [[National Academy of Sciences]] hosted a meeting in December of 2011 entitled "Emerging Technologies for Measuring Individual Exposomes."<ref>{{cite web|title=National Academy of Sciences meeting|url=http://nas-sites.org/emergingscience/meetings/exposome/|accessdate=21 January 2013}}</ref> A [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] overview  "Exposome and Exposomics" outlines the three priority areas for researching the occupational exposome as identified by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]].<ref name = "CDC">[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (2012). [http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/exposome/ "Exposome and Exposomics"].  Retrieved 5 March 2013.</ref> The [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) has made investments in technologies that support exposome-related research, including biosensors, and supports research on gene-environment interactions.<ref>{{cite web|title=NIEHS Gene-Environment studies|url=http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/science/gene-env/index.cfm|accessdate=21 January 2013}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=Genes and Environment Initiative|url=http://www.genome.gov/19518663|accessdate=21 January 2013}}</ref> However, the NIH has yet to fund any large centers focusing on the exposome like those in Europe.

==Proposed Human Exposome Project (HEP)==

The idea of a Human Exposome Project, analogous to the [[Human Genome Project]], has been proposed and discussed in numerous scientific meetings, but no such project exists at this time. Several investigators have argued that such an initiative should occur, but given the lack of clarity on how science would go about pursuing such a project, support has been lacking.<ref> Arnaud, Celia Henry (16 August 2010). [https://pubs.acs.org/cen/science/88/8833sci1.html "Exposing The Exposome"]. ''Chemical & Engineering News'', Vol. 88, No. 33, pp. 42-44. [[American Chemical Society]].
