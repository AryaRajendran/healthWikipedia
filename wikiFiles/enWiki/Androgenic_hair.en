{{Human hair}}
{{wiktionary|androgenic hair}}
'''Androgenic hair''', colloquially '''body hair''', is the [[terminal hair]] that develops on the [[human]] [[body]] during and after [[puberty]]. It is differentiated from the head [[hair]] and less visible [[vellus hair]], which are much finer and lighter in color. The growth of androgenic hair is related to the level of [[androgen]]s (male [[hormone]]s) in the individual. Due to a normally higher level of androgen, men tend to have more androgenic hair than women.

From [[childhood]] onward, regardless of [[gender]], vellus hair covers almost the entire area of the human body. Exceptions include the lips, the backs of the [[ear]]s, the palms of [[hand]]s, the soles of the  [[foot|feet]], certain external [[genitals|genital]] areas, the [[navel]] and [[scar]] tissue. The density of  hair &ndash; the number of [[hair follicle]]s per [[area]] of skin &ndash; varies from person to person. In many cases, areas on the human body that contain vellus hair will begin to produce darker, thicker body hair.  An example of this is the growth of an adolescent's beard on a once smooth chin.

Androgenic hair follows the same [[Human hair growth|growth]] pattern as the hair that grows on the scalp, only the anagen phase is shorter, and the telogen phase is longer.  While the anagen phase for the hair on one's head lasts for years, the androgenic hair growing phase lasts a few months.<ref name="otolaryngology1">(Hair Growth: EMedicine Otolaryngology and Facial Plastic Surgery)</ref>  The telogen phase for body hair lasts close to a year.<ref name="otolaryngology1"/>  This shortened growing period and extended dormant period explains why the hair on the head tends to be much longer than other hair found on the body.  Differences in length seen in comparing the hair on the back of the hand and pubic hair, for example, can be explained by varied growth cycles in those two regions.  The same goes for differences in body hair length seen in different people, especially when comparing men and women.

== Development and growth ==
{{Main|Human hair growth}}

Hair follicles are to varying degrees sensitive to androgen, primarily [[testosterone]] and its derivatives, with different areas on the body having different sensitivity. As androgen levels increase, the rate of hair growth and the weight of the hairs increase. Genetic factors determine both individual levels of androgen and the hair follicle's sensitivity to androgen, as well as other characteristics such as hair colour, type of hair and hair retention.

Rising levels of androgen during puberty cause vellus hair to transform into terminal hair over many areas of the body. The sequence of appearance of terminal hair reflects the level of androgen sensitivity, with [[pubic hair]] being the first to appear due to the area's special sensitivity to androgen. The appearance of pubic hair in both sexes is usually seen as an indication of the start of a person's puberty. There is a [[sexual differentiation]] in the amount and distribution of androgenic hair, with men tending to have more terminal hair in more areas. This includes [[facial hair]], [[chest hair]], [[abdominal hair]], [[leg hair|leg]] and [[arm hair]], and [[foot hair]]. Women retain more of the less visible vellus hair, although leg, arm, and foot hair can be noticeable on women.  It is not unusual for women to have a few terminal hairs around their nipples as well.
In the later decades of life, especially after the 5th decade, there begins a reduction in body hair especially marked in the legs.  The reason for this is not known but it could be due to poorer circulation, lower free circulating hormone levels or other reasons.

== Growth distribution ==
Like much of the hair on the human body, leg, arm, chest, and back hair begin as vellus hair.  As people age, the hair in these regions will often begin to grow darker and more abundantly.  This will typically happen during or after puberty.  Men will generally have more abundant, coarser hair on the legs, arms, chest, and back, while women tend to have a less drastic change in the hair growth in these areas.  However, some women will grow darker, longer hair in one or more of these regions.

=== Arms ===
Arm hair grows on a human's [[forearms]], sometimes even on the elbow area. Terminal arm hair is concentrated on the wrist end of the forearm, extending over the [[hand]]. Terminal hair growth in adolescent and adult males is often much more intense than that in females, particularly for individuals with dark hair. In some cultures, it is common for women to remove arm hair, though this practice is less frequent than that of leg hair removal.

Terminal hair growth on [[arm]]s is a secondary sexual characteristic in boys and appears in the last stages of puberty.  Vellus arm hair is usually concentrated on the elbow end of the forearm and often ends on the lower part of the [[upper arm]]. This type of intense arm vellus hair growth sometimes occurs in young women and people of both genders until puberty. Even though this causes the arms to appear hairy, it is not caused by testosterone. The hair is softer and different from men's arm hair, in texture.

=== Feet ===
Visible hair appearing on the top surfaces of the feet and [[toes]] generally begins with the onset of puberty. Terminal hair growth on the feet is typically more intense in adult and adolescent males than in females.

=== Legs ===
Leg hair generally appears at the onset of adulthood, with the legs of men most often hairier than those of women. For a variety of reasons, people may [[leg shaving|shave their leg hair]], including cultural practice or individual needs. Around the world, females generally shave their leg hair more regularly than men, to conform with the social norms of many cultures, many of which perceive smooth skin as a sign of youth and beauty. However, athletes of both sexes &ndash; [[Swimming (sport)|swimmers]], [[track and field|runners]], [[bicycling|cyclists]] and [[bodybuilding|bodybuilders]] in particular &ndash; may shave their androgenic hair to reduce friction, highlight muscular development or to make it easier to get into and out of skin-tight clothing. The main reason why professional cyclists shave their legs is to make treatment of [[road rash]] less difficult.

===Pubic===
[[Pubic hair]] is a collection of coarse hair found in the pubic region.  It will often also grow on the thighs and abdomen.  Zoologist [[Desmond Morris]] disputes theories that it developed to signal sexual maturity or protect the skin from chafing during copulation, and prefers the explanation that pubic hair acts as a scent trap. Also, both genders having thick pubic hairs act as a sort of cushion during intercourse.<ref name="morris-bodywatching">{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Desmond|title=Bodywatching: a field guide to the human species|year=1985|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|page=209}}</ref>

The [[genital]] area of males and females are first inhabited by shorter, lighter vellus hairs that are next to invisible and only begin to develop into darker, thicker pubic hair at [[puberty]].  At this time, the [[pituitary gland]] secretes [[gonadotropin]] hormones which trigger the production of testosterone in the ovaries and testicles, respectively, promoting pubic hair growth. The average ages pubic hair begins to grow in males and females are 12 and 11, respectively. However, in some males and females it has been known for pubic hair to start as early as 9 and 8, respectively.

Just as individual people differ in scalp hair color, they can also differ in pubic hair color.  Differences in thickness, growth rate, and length are also evident.

Pubic hair removal occurs in certain cultures, for example it has long been practiced widely, if not universally, in the [[Muslim]] world due to a religious injunction. In Western culture, beginning in the 1980s, trends have influenced women to undertake more and more extreme forms of hair removal; the trend later spread to men as well.<ref>{{cite web|title=Looking Through the Bushes: The Disappearance of Pubic Hair|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/roger-friedland/women-pubic-hair_b_875465.html}}</ref>

===Facial===

[[Facial hair]], as the name suggests, grows primarily on or around one's [[face]]. Both men and women experience facial hair growth, even though it is commonly accepted as a [[masculine]] trait. Like pubic hair, non-vellus facial hair will begin to grow in around puberty. [[Moustache]]s in young men usually begin to grow in at around the age of 13, although some men may not grow a moustache until they reach late teens.

==Function==

Androgenic hair provides tactile sensory input by transferring hair movement and vibration via the shaft to sensory nerves within the skin. Follicular nerves detect displacement of hair shafts and other nerve ending in the surrounding skin detect vibration and distortions of the skin around the follicles. Androgenic hair extends the sense of touch beyond the surface of the skin into the air and space surrounding it, detecting air movements as well as hair displacement from contact by insects or objects.<ref>"Controlled Stimulation of Hair Follicle Receptors - J.Sabah. J Appl Physiol.1974; 36: 256-257"http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/36/2/256.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/receptor.html |title=Neuroscience for Kids - Receptors |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref>

== Evolution ==
Determining the evolutionary function of androgenic hair must take into account both [[human evolution]] and the thermal properties of hair itself.

The thermodynamic properties of hair are based on the properties of the [[keratin]] strands and [[amino acids]] that combine into a 'coiled' structure. This structure lends to many of the properties of hair, such as its ability to stretch and return to its original length. It should be noted that this coiled structure does not predispose curly or frizzy hair, both of which are defined by oval or triangular hair follicle cross-sections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hair-science.com/_int/_en/topic/topic_sousrub.aspx?tc=ROOT-HAIR-SCIENCE%5EAMAZINGLY-NATURAL%5ESHAPE-WORKSHOP&cur=SHAPE-WORKSHOP |title=Hair Shape |publisher=Hair-science.com |date=2005-02-01 |accessdate=2009-09-18}}</ref>

===Evolution of less body hair===
[[File:Congo warrior Negroid Negroe Black African spear couple.png|200px|thumb|Congo man and woman]]
Hair is a very good thermal conductor and aids both heat transfer into and out of the body. When [[goose bumps]] are observed, small muscles ([[Arrector pili muscle]]) contract to raise the hairs both to provide insulation, by reducing cooling by air convection of the skin, as well as in response to central nervous stimulus, similar to the feeling of 'hairs standing up on the back of your neck'. This phenomenon also occurs when static charge is built up and stored in the hair. Keratin however can easily be damaged by excessive heat and dryness, suggesting that extreme sun exposure, perhaps due to a lack of clothing, would result in perpetual hair destruction, eventually resulting in the genes being bred out in favor of high skin [[pigmentation]]. It is also true that parasites can live on and in hair thus peoples who preserved their body hair would have required greater general hygiene to prevent diseases caused by such as well as a need for grooming, two predominant factors in the civilization of homo sapiens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hair-science.com/_int/_en/topic/topic_sousrub.aspx?tc=ROOT-HAIR-SCIENCE^SO-STURDY-SO-FRAGILE^PROPERTIES-OF-HAIR^STRONG-HAIR&cur=STRONG-HAIR |title=Properties Of Hair |publisher=Hair-science.com |date=2005-02-01 |accessdate=2009-09-18}}</ref>

Markus J. Rantala of the Department of Biological and Environmental Science, [[University of Jyväskylä]], [[Finland]], said humans evolved by "natural selection" to be hairless when the trade off of "having fewer parasites" became more important than having a "warming, furry coat".<ref name="Rantala" />

P.E. Wheeler of the Department of Biology at [[Liverpool Polytechnic]] said [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] [[Savannah]] [[mammal]]s of similar volume to humans have body hair to keep warm while only larger quadrupedal Savannah mammals lack body hair, because their body volume itself is enough to keep them warm.<ref name="Wheeler" /> Therefore, Wheeler said humans who should have body hair based on predictions of body volume alone for Savannah mammals evolved no body hair after evolving [[bipedalism]] which he said reduced the amount of body area exposed to the sun by 40%, reducing the solar warming effect on the human body.<ref name="Wheeler">Wheeler, P.E.

===Sexual selection===
{{Main|sexual selection}}
Cambridge University zoologist Charles Goodhart believed men have long preferred the "hairless trait" in women, ever since the existence of the "hairless trait" occurred in our hairy forebears 70,000-120,000 years ago during the last episode of global warming. Goodhart argued that humans are relatively hairless today compared to our ancestors because women who were sexually selected for their "hairless trait" passed it on to both their male and female offspring.<ref>{{cite web|author=Danny Penman |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/zoologist-claims-sexual-preference-led-the-naked-ape-to-lose-its-hair-1581177.html |title=Zoologist claims sexual preference led the naked ape to lose its hair - News |publisher=The Independent |date=1995-11-10 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref>

Markus J. Rantala of the Department of Biological and Environmental Science, [[University of Jyväskylä]], [[Finland]], said the existence of [[androgen]] dependent hair on men could be explained by [[sexual attraction]] whereby hair on the genitals would trap [[pheromones]] and hair on the chin would make the chin appear more massive.<ref name="Rantala">Rantala, M.J.
