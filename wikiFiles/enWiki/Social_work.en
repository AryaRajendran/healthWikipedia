'''Social work''' is a professional and academic discipline that seeks to improve the [[quality of life]] and wellbeing of an individual, group, or community by intervening through research, policy, community organizing, direct practice, and teaching on behalf of those afflicted with poverty or any real or perceived [[social injustice]]s and violations of their [[human rights]].  Research is often focused on areas such as human development, [[social policy]], public administration, [[psychotherapy]], program evaluation, and international and community development. Social workers are organized into local, national, continental and international [[professional bodies]]. Social work, an interdisciplinary field, includes theories from [[economics]], [[education]], [[sociology]], [[medicine]], [[philosophy]], [[politics]], [[anthropology]], and [[psychology]]. 

==History==

{{Main|History of social work}}
The concept of charity goes back to ancient times, and the practice of providing for the poor has roots in many major ancient civilizations and world [[religion]]s.

Social work has its roots in the social and economic upheaval wrought by the [[Industrial Revolution]], in particular the struggle of [[society]] to deal with [[poverty]] and its resultant problems. Because dealing with poverty was the main focus of early social work, it is intricately linked with the idea of charity work, but it must now be understood in much broader terms. For instance, it is not uncommon for modern social workers to find themselves dealing with the consequences arising from many other "social problems" such as racism, sexism, homophobia, and discrimination based on age or on physical or mental ability. Modern social workers can be found helping to deal with the consequences of these and many other social maladies in all areas of the human services professions and in many other fields besides.

Whereas social work started on a more scientific footing aimed at controlling and reforming individuals (at one stage supporting the notion that poverty was a disease), it has in more recent times adopted a more critical and holistic approach to understanding and intervening in social problems. This has led, for example, to the reconceptualisation of poverty as more a problem of the haves versus the have-nots rather than its former status as a disease, illness, or moral defect in need of treatment. This also points to another historical development in the evolution of social work: once a profession engaged more in social control, it has become one more directed at social and personal empowerment. That is not to say that modern social workers do not engage in social control (consider, for example, child protection workers), and many, if not most, social workers would likely agree that this is an ongoing tension and debate in the profession. For example, see the debate between the structural social work and humanistic social work.<ref name="Payne">Payne, M. (2011). ''Humanistic Social Work: Core Principles in Practice. Chicago: Lyceum, Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan''.</ref>

==Contemporary professional development==
[[Image:Czythumbur.jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|Social Work education begins in a systematised manner in higher educational institutes (universities, colleges, etc.), but it is also an ongoing process that occurs though research and in the workplace.]]

The [[International Federation of Social Workers]] states, of social work today, that <blockquote>
"social work bases its methodology on a systematic body of evidence-based knowledge derived from research and practice evaluation, including local and [[Traditional knowledge|indigenous knowledge]] specific to its context. It recognizes the complexity of interactions between human beings and their environment, and the capacity of people both to be affected by and to alter the multiple influences upon them including bio-psychosocial factors. The social work profession draws on theories of [[Developmental psychology|human development]], social theory and social systems to analyse complex situations and to facilitate individual, organizational, social and cultural changes."<ref name="IFSW">{{cite web|title =Definition of Social Work |work=IFSW General Meeting in [[Montreal, Canada]], July 2000 |publisher =[http://www.ifsw.org/home International Federation of Social Workers] |date =04/10/2005 |url =http://www.ifsw.org/en/p38000208.html |accessdate =2008-02-19}}</ref></blockquote>

==Qualifications==

{{Main|Qualifications for professional social work}}

The education of social workers begins with a Bachelor's degree (BA, BSc, BSSW, BSW, etc.) or diploma in Social Work. Some countries offer Postgraduate degrees in Social Work, like master's (such as '''[[Master of Social Work#Graduate Schools of Social Work|MSW]]''', MSS, MA, MSc, MRes, MPhil etc.) or doctoral studies (such as PhD and DSW (Doctor of Social Work)). More and more graduates of social work continue to post-doctoral studies. Some argue that social work education is a lifelong process.

A number of countries and jurisdictions requires [[Licensure|registration]] or [[licensure]] of people working as social workers, and there are mandated [[wikt:qualification|qualifications]].<ref>The [[National Association of Social Workers]] (NASW, 2005). NASW Fact Sheet. Retrieved November 15, 2006 from http://www.socialworkers.org.</ref> In other places, a professional association sets academic requirements for admission to membership. The success of these professional bodies' efforts is demonstrated in that these same requirements are recognized by employers as necessary for employment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cswna.org|title=Catholic Social Workers National Association}}</ref>

===Professional associations===
Social workers have a number of professional associations, which provide ethical guidance and other forms of support for their members and for social work in general. These associations can be international, continental or semi-continental, national, and regional. The main international associations are the [[International Federation of Social Workers]] (IFSW) and the [[International Association of Schools of Social Work]] (IASSW).
The largest professional social work association in the United States is the National Association of Social Workers.

===Trade unions representing social workers===
In the United Kingdom, just over 50% of social workers are employed by local authorities, and many of these are represented by [[UNISON]], the public sector employee union. Smaller numbers are members of [[Unite the union]] and the [[GMB (trade union)]]. The British Union of Social Work Employees (BUSWE) has been a section of the [[Community (trade union)]] since 2008. In 2011, the [[British Association of Social Workers]] launched a trade union arm for the second time (it first tried this in 1976) called the Social Workers' Union, but this body is not recognised by the [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] or by any employers.

==Role of the professional==

{{Main|Role of the professional social worker}}

The main tasks of professional social workers can include a number of services such as [[case management (mental health)|case management]] (linking service users with agencies and programs that will meet their psychosocial needs - mainly common in US and UK), [[counseling]] and [[psychotherapy]], human services management, social [[Social welfare function|welfare]] policy analysis, policy and practice development, [[community organizing]], international, social and community development, advocacy, teaching (in schools of social work), and social and political research.
