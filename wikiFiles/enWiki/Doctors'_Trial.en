[[File:Karl-Brandt.jpg|thumb|A sentence of death by hanging is pronounced by a US War Crimes Tribunal upon Adolf Hitler's personal physician, 43-year old Karl Brandt. Brandt was also ''Reich'' Commissar for Health and Sanitation.]]

The '''Doctors' Trial''' (officially '''''United States of America v. [[Karl Brandt]], et al.''''') was the first of 12 trials for [[war crime]]s of German doctors that the [[United States]] authorities held in their occupation zone in [[Nuremberg]], [[Germany]] after the end of [[World War II]]. These trials were held before US military courts, not before the [[International Military Tribunal]], but took place in the same rooms at the [[Palace of Justice (Nuremberg)|Palace of Justice]]. The trials are collectively known as the "[[Subsequent Nuremberg Trials]]", formally the "Trials of War Criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals" (NMT).

Twenty of the 23 defendants were medical doctors (Viktor Brack, Rudolf Brandt, and Wolfram Sievers were Nazi officials) and were accused of having been involved in [[Nazi human experimentation]] and [[Aktion T4|mass murder under the guise of euthanasia]]. [[Josef Mengele]], one of the leading Nazi doctors, had evaded capture.

The judges in this case, heard before Military Tribunal I, were [[Walter B. Beals]] (presiding judge) from [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Harold L. Sebring]] from [[Florida]], and [[Johnson T. Crawford]] from [[Oklahoma]], with [[Victor C. Swearingen]], a former special assistant to the [[Attorney General]] of the United States, as an alternate judge. The Chief of Counsel for the Prosecution was [[Telford Taylor]] and the chief prosecutor was [[James M. McHaney]]. The [[indictment]] was filed on October 25, 1946; the trial lasted from December 9 that year until August 20, 1947. Of the 23 defendants, seven were acquitted and seven received death sentences; the remainder received prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.

== Indictment ==
The accused faced four charges, including:

#Conspiracy to commit [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] as described in counts 2 and 3;
#War crimes: performing medical experiments, without the subjects' consent, on prisoners of war and civilians of occupied countries, in the course of which experiments the defendants committed murders, brutalities, cruelties, tortures, atrocities, and other inhuman acts. Also planning and performing the mass murder of prisoners of war and civilians of occupied countries, stigmatized as aged, insane, incurably ill, deformed, and so on, by gas, lethal injections, and diverse other means in nursing homes, hospitals, and asylums during the Euthanasia Program and participating in the mass murder of [[concentration camp]] inmates.
#Crimes against humanity: committing crimes described under count 2 also on German nationals.
#Membership in a criminal organization, the [[SS]].

The tribunal largely dropped count 1, stating that the charge was beyond its jurisdiction.

Those sentenced to death were [[hanged]] on June 2, 1948 in [[Landsberg prison]], [[Bavaria]].

For some, the difference between receiving a prison term and the death sentence was membership in the SS, "an organization declared criminal by the judgement of the International Military Tribunal". However, some SS medical personnel received prison sentences. The degree of personal involvement and/or presiding over groups involved was a factor in others.
