The term '''ballistic trauma''' or gunshot wound (GSW) refers to a form of [[physical trauma]] sustained from the discharge of [[Weapon|arms]] or [[Ammunition|munitions]].<ref name="mahoney_1">Mahoney, P. F., et al. (2004). ''Section 1 : Introduction, Background and Science'' p4</ref> The most common forms of ballistic trauma stem from [[firearm]]s used in armed conflicts, civilian sporting and recreational pursuits, and criminal activity.<ref name="mahoney_2">Mahoney, P. F., et al. (2004). ''The International Small Arms Situation'' p6</ref> Ballistic trauma is sometimes fatal for the recipient, or causes long term negative consequences.

==Destructive effects==
The degree of tissue disruption caused by a [[projectile]] is related to the size of the temporary versus [[permanent cavity]] it creates as it passes through tissue.<ref>[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA221395&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf Wound Ballistic Research of the Past Twenty Years: A Giant Step Backwards]</ref> The extent of [[cavitation]], in turn, is related to the following characteristics of the projectile:
*[[Kinetic energy]]: KE = ''mv''<sup>2</sup>/2 (where ''m'' is [[mass]] and ''v'' is [[velocity]]). This helps to explain why wounds produced by missiles of higher mass and/or higher velocity produce greater tissue disruption than missiles of lower mass and velocity.

*[[Deformation (engineering)|Deformation]]
*[[Fragmentation (weaponry)|Fragmentation]]

The immediate damaging effect of the bullet is typically severe bleeding, and with it the potential for [[Hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]], a condition characterized by inadequate delivery of oxygen to vital organs. In the case of traumatic hypovolemic shock, this failure of adequate oxygen delivery is due to blood loss, as blood is the means of delivering oxygen to the body's constituent parts.  Immediate effects can result when a bullet strikes a critical organ such as the [[heart]] or damages a component of the [[central nervous system]] such as the [[Vertebral column|spine]] or brain. Common causes of death following gunshot injury include [[exsanguination]], [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] caused by [[pneumothorax]], catastrophic injury to the heart and larger blood vessels, and damage to the brain or central nervous system.  Additionally, gunshot wounds typically involve a large degree of nearby tissue disruption and destruction due to the physical effects of the projectile.  Non-fatal gunshot wounds can result in serious disability.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Gunshot injuries can vary widely from case to case since the location of the injury can be in any part of the body, with wide variations in entry point. Also, the path and possible fragmentation of the bullet within the body is unpredictable. The study of the dynamics of bullets in gunshot injuries is called [[terminal ballistics]]. 

Non-fatal gunshot wounds frequently have severe and long-lasting effects, even after the victim has made a successful recovery.<ref>[http://negligentdischarge.com/leg.html Negligent discharge page]</ref> Typically, the consequences involve some form of major [[disfigurement]] and/or permanent [[disability]]. As a rule, all gunshot wounds are considered [[medical emergencies]] that require immediate hospital treatment. Hospitals are generally required to report all gunshot wounds to police.<ref>http://www.cmaj.ca/content/170/8/1256.full</ref>

== Origins of medical treatment ==

Until the 1880s, the standard practice for treating a gunshot wound called for physicians to insert their [[Asepsis|unsterilized]] fingers into the wound to probe and locate the path of the bullet.<ref name="Schaffer">{{Cite news|ref=Schaffer |first=Amanda |last=Schaffer |title=A President Felled by an Assassin and 1880’s Medical Care |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/25/health/25garf.html|newspaper=[[New York Times]] |location=[[New York City|New York]], [[New York State|New York]] |date=July 25, 2006|accessdate=04-08-2011}}</ref> Surgically opening abdominal cavities to repair gunshot wounds,<ref name=crane>{{cite web|last=Crane|first=Michael A.|title=Dr. Goodfellow: Gunfighter's Surgeon|url=http://www.doc-holliday.com/article.pdf|accessdate=10 March 2013 |year=2003}}</ref> [[Germ theory of disease|Germ theory]], and Dr. [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]]'s technique for "antisepsis surgery" using dilute [[carbolic acid]], which had been first demonstrated in 1865, had not yet been accepted as standard practice  by prevailing medical authorities. For example, sixteen doctors attended to [[James A. Garfield|Garfield]] and most probed the wound with their fingers or dirty instruments.<ref name=eyewitness>{{cite web|title=The Death Of President Garfield, 1881|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/gar.htm|accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> Historians agree that massive infection was a significant factor in [[Assassination of James A.

At almost the same time, in [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]], [[Arizona Territory]] on July 13, 1881, Dr.[[George E. Goodfellow]] performed the first [[laparotomy]] to treat an abdominal gunshot wound.<ref>{{cite book| title=Annual of the Universal Medical Sciences And Analytical Index 1888-1896 |publisher=The F.A.
