An '''adhesion barrier''' is a medical [[wikt:implant|implant]] that can be used to reduce abnormal internal [[Scar|scarring]] ([[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]]) following [[surgery]] by separating the internal tissues and organs while they heal.

Surgeons have realized that proper surgical technique is crucial to reduce adhesion formation. In addition, for more than a century, adjuvants have been used to this affect including drugs and materials such as animal membranes, [[gold foil]], [[mineral oil]], sheets made of [[rubber]] and [[Teflon]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.adhesions.org/pt7barriers.htm |author= |title=Adhesion Barriers| publisher=International Adhesions Society |accessdate=03/13/2013}}</ref> Nevertheless, adhesions do occur and appear to be, to some degree, an almost unavoidable consequence of [[Abdominal surgery|abdominal]] and pelvic surgery. These adhesions can lead to significant post-surgical [[disease#terminology|morbidity]] including [[bowel obstruction]], [[infertility]], and [[chronic pelvic pain]] or [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[abdominal pain]].

Surgeons and [[healthcare professional]]s developed several methods for minimizing tissue injury in order to minimize the formation of adhesions. However, even an experienced surgeon using advanced techniques may not be able to prevent the formation of adhesions following surgery without the aid of an adhesion barrier. Consequently, many surgeons have come to apply adhesion barriers for adhesion prevention following abdominal and pelvic surgery.

==Description==
Adhesion barriers are physical films, [[fabric]]s, [[gel]]s or other materials that are applied between layers of tissues at the end of a surgery before the [[cutting|incision]] site is closed. While in place, the adhesion barrier acts as a physical barrier to separate traumatized tissue surfaces so that they do not adhere to one another while the tissue surfaces heal. Once the tissue surfaces heal, which is usually between 3 and 7 days, the barrier dissolves and is absorbed by the body.

==Commercial availability==
The first commercially available adhesion barrier it seems was Cargile Membrane, a preserved [[Peritoneum|peritoneal]] membrane of the Danish [[Ox]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17861646 |year=1905 |last1=Craig |first1=Albert B. |last2=Ellis |first2=Aller G. |title=I.

In the United States, Interceed,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethicon360.com/products/gynecare-interceed-absorbable-adhesion-barrier%20Gynecare%20Interceed%20Absorbable%20Adhesion%20Barrier |title=ETHICON 360 |publisher=ETHICON 360 |date=2012-04-12 |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> Seprafilm<ref>http://www.seprafilm.com/patients.aspx</ref> and Adept<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baxter.com/healthcare_professionals/products/adept.html |title=ADEPT® Adhesion Reduction Solution [4% Icodextrin&#93; &#124; Healthcare Professionals &#124; Baxter U.S |publisher=Baxter.com |date=2012-02-18 |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> are the three products approved by the [[FDA]] for use as an adhesion barrier after abdominal or pelvic surgery.

Seprafilm (made by [[Genzyme]]) is a clear, sticky film composed of chemically modified [[Sugar (chemistry)|sugar]]s, some of which occur naturally in the human body. It sticks to the tissues to which it is applied and is slowly absorbed into the body over a period of seven days. It is approved for use in certain types of pelvic or abdominal surgery.

Interceed (made by [[Johnson & Johnson]]) is a [[knitted fabric]] composed of a modified [[cellulose]] that swells and eventually gels after being placed on the injured site, and, like Seprafilm, forms a barrier and then is slowly absorbed over a period of days. It is approved for use in pelvic surgery. Although it is technically possible to apply either Seprafilm and Interceed [[Laparoscopic surgery|laparoscopically]], neither product is approved for this use in the USA.

Adept ([[Baxter International|Baxter]]) is a solution of [[Icodextrin]] that when instilled in a large volume causes organs to float apart, reducing the possibility of attachment.

Products available for adhesion prevention outside the [[abdominal cavity|abdominal]] and [[pelvic cavity|pelvic]] cavities inside or outside the USA include ADCON Gel<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bioscompass.com/adcongel2.html |title=Dedicated to Surgical Adhesion Prevention - Adcon®Gel |publisher=BiosCompass |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> (spine and tendon surgery), Sepragel ENT, INCERT<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anikatherapeutics.com/products/surgical/index.html |title=Anika Therapeutics – Products - Anti-Adhesion |publisher=Anikatherapeutics.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> (spine), Tenoglide (tendon), Oxiplex<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fziomed.com/products/spine-surgery.cfm |title=Spine Surgery: Adhesion Prevention |publisher=Fziomed.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> (Medishield) (spine) and REPEL CV (Cardiac).

==Evaluation==
According to [[Cochrane Collaboration| Cochrane Summaries]], Gore-Tex is more effective than Interceed, but requires a second surgery for removal as it is not absorbable. Seprafil or Fibrin sheets were not found to be effective.<ref>{{cite web|  url=http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD000475/barrier-agents-may-be-effective-in-reducing-the-formation-of-pelvic-adhesions-but-there-is-no-evidence-on-their-direct-effects-including-pregnancy-rates | author=Ahmad G, Duffy JMN, Farquhar C, Vail A, Vanderkerchove P, Watson A, Wiseman D|  title=Barrier agents may be effective in reducing the formation of pelvic adhesions but there is no evidence on their direct effects including pregnancy rates|  publisher=Cochrane Summaries|  date=11/10/2010|  accessdate=03/13/2013}}</ref> Vigorous follow-up is crucial, thus more studies are needed in gynecologic surgery as a major drawback of studies is that they do not incorporate the gold standard of success, namely [[pregnancy rate]]s.
