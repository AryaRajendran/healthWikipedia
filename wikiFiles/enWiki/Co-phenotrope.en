The [[medication|drug]] combination '''diphenoxylate/atropine''' ([[trade name]] '''Lomotil''') is a popular oral [[anti-diarrheal]] in the [[United States]], manufactured by [[Pfizer]]. Its UK [[British Approved Name|BAN]] generic name is '''co-phenotrope'''.

Its active ingredients are [[diphenoxylate]] and [[atropine]]. Diphenoxylate is anti-diarrheal and atropine is [[anticholinergic]]. A subtherapeutic amount of [[atropine]] sulfate is present to discourage deliberate overdosage. Atropine has no anti-diarrheal properties, but will cause [[tachycardia]] when overused. The medication [[diphenoxylate]] works by slowing down the movement of the [[intestine]]s. In some cases Lomotil has been shown to ease symptoms of opiate/opioid withdrawal. 

The inactive ingredients of Lomotil (as a liquid; it comes in pill form as well) are [[cherry]] flavor, [[citric acid]], [[ethyl alcohol]] 15%, FD&C Yellow No. 6, [[glycerin]], [[Trisodium phosphate|sodium phosphate]], [[sorbitol]], and [[water]].

Other trade names for the same therapeutic combination are Lofene, Logen, 
Lomanate and Lonox, among others. In other countries, Lomotil may have other names. 

In the United States, Lomotil is classified as a [[Controlled Substances Act|Schedule V]] controlled substance by federal law, and is available only for a medical purpose.<ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/csa/829.htm#c DEA, Title 21, Section 829<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
