'''Charles Julius Hempel''' (5 September 1811 [[Solingen]], [[Prussia]] - 25 September 1879 [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]) was a German-born [[translation|translator]] and [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] [[physician]] who worked in the [[United States]].

==Biography==
After completing his collegiate course at Solingen, he attended lectures at the [[University of Paris|Université de France]] and [[Collège de France]], in [[Paris]], and financed his schooling by translating.<ref name="anb">{{Cite ANB|Hempel, Charles Julius|author=Christopher D. Ellithorp}}</ref> At the Université de France, he assisted [[Jules Michelet]], who succeeded [[François Guizot]] as professor of history, in the publication of his ''Histoire de la France'' (“History of France”).

He came to the United States in 1835, and for ten years resided in the family of [[Piero Maroncelli]], the intimate friend of the revolutionist [[Silvio Pellico]]. There he imbibed an ardent love for [[music]] and [[Italian literature]] and got to know the [[Carbonari]] refugees in America. 
Other significant influences were the social theorist [[Albert Brisbane]] and the theologian [[George Bush (Biblical scholar)|George Bush]].<ref name="anb"/>

While attending medical lectures at the [[New York University|University of New York]], where he graduated in 1845, he became associated with several eminent homeopathic practitioners, and soon after his graduation he began to translate some of the more important works relating to homeopathy. In 1855 he married Mary (Coggeshall) Calder, daughter of George Coggeshall of Grand Rapids, Michigan.<ref name="dab">{{Cite DAB|Hempel, Charles Julius|author=Clarence Bartlett|year=1932}}</ref>  

He was appointed professor of materia medica and therapeutics in the [[Hahnemann Medical College]] of Philadelphia in 1857.  He had an approach to homeopathy distinct from the Hahnemann school.  His translations could be a source of controversy in the homeopathic community, in particular [[Constantine Hering]] and Adolph Lippe raised objections due to errors in Hempel's early translations and unauthorized additions from his own experience.<ref name="anb"/>

When the Hahnemann Medical College was reorganized in 1860, Hempel and some others left. During his stay in [[Philadelphia]], he also published his book, ''Materia Medica and Therapeutics''.<ref name=bradford>{{Cite book|author=Thomas Lindsley Bradford|title=History of the Homoeopathic medical college of Pennsylvania|pages=337–8|year=1898|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gddLAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA337}}</ref>
On the death of his father-in-law in 1861,<ref name="dab"/> he went to Grand Rapids to settle up the estate. He decided to make the change of location permanent and soon had a large homeopathic practice in that city.<ref name=bradford/>

His health failing, he traveled to Italy and Germany in 1872,<ref name=bradford/> but the change was not beneficial, and he returned to Grand Rapids, where he died. Hempel was one of the earliest honorary members of the British Homeopathic Society, and was the recipient of diplomas and certificates of membership from many medical colleges and associations.  His translations and original works permit him to be called the father of English homeopathic literature.<ref name=bradford/>
