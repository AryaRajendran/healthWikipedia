[[Image:Wiggers Diagram.png|thumb|right|400px|Cardiac events occurring in the cardiac cycle. Two complete cycles are illustrated.]]

The '''cardiac cycle''' is a term referring to all or any of the events related to the flow or [[blood pressure]] that occurs from the beginning of one [[heart sounds|heartbeat]] to the beginning of the next.<ref name="Medical Physiology">Guyton, A.C. & Hall, J.E. (2006) ''Textbook of Medical Physiology'' (11th ed.) Philadelphia: Elsevier Saunder ISBN 0-7216-0240-1</ref>  The frequency of the cardiac cycle is described by the [[heart rate]].  Each beat of the heart involves five major stages. The first two stages, often considered together as the "ventricular filling" stage, involve the movement of blood from atria into ventricles. The next three stages involve the movement of blood from the ventricles to the pulmonary artery (in the case of the right ventricle) and the aorta (in the case of the left ventricle).<ref name="Medical Physiology"/>

The first, "early [[diastole]]," is when the [[semilunar valves]] close, the [[Heart valve|atrioventricular (AV) valves]] are open, and the whole heart is relaxed. The second, "atrial [[systole (medicine)|systole]]," is when the atrium contracts, and blood flows from atrium to the ventricle. The third, "isovolumic ventricular contraction," is when the ventricles begin to contract, the AV and semilunar valves close, and there is no change in volume. The fourth, "ventricular ejection," is when the ventricles are empty and contracting, and the semilunar valves are open. During the fifth stage, "Isovolumic ventricular relaxation," pressure decreases, no blood enters the ventricles, the ventricles stop contracting and begin to relax, and the semilunar valves close due to the pressure of blood in the aorta.

Throughout the cardiac cycle, [[blood pressure]] increases and decreases. The cardiac cycle is coordinated by a series of electrical impulses that are produced by specialized heart cells found within the [[sinoatrial node]] and the [[atrioventricular node]]. The cardiac muscle is composed of [[myocytes]] which initiate their own contraction without help of external nerves (with the exception of modifying the heart rate due to metabolic demand). Under normal circumstances, each cycle takes approximately one second.

==Anatomical basis of the cardiac cycle==
{{main|Heart}}

The heart is a four-chambered [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] consisting of right and left halves. Two of the chambers, the left and right [[Atrium (heart)|atria]], are entry-points into the heart, while the other two chambers, the left and right [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]], are responsible for contractions that send the blood through the circulation. The circulation is split into the [[pulmonary]] and [[systemic circulation]]. The role of the right ventricle is to pump [[deoxygenated]] blood to the lungs through the pulmonary trunk and pulmonary arteries. The role of the left ventricle is to pump newly oxygenated blood to the body through the aorta.

==Atrial systole==

[[Image:Heart diastole.png|thumb|right|Atrial systole]]
'''Atrial systole''' is the contraction of the heart muscle (''myocardia'') of the left and right [[Atrium (heart)|atria]]. Normally, both atria contract at the same time.  The term ''systole'' is synonymous  with contraction (movement or shortening) of a muscle. ''Electrical systole'' is the electrical activity that stimulates the [[myocardium]] of the chambers of the heart to make them contract.  This is soon followed by ''Mechanical systole'', which is the mechanical contraction of the heart.

As the atria contract, the blood pressure in each atrium increases, forcing additional blood into the ventricles. The additional flow of blood is called '''atrial kick'''.

80% of the blood flows passively down to the ventricles, so the atria do not have to contract a great amount.<ref>Advanced Biology for You - Gareth Williams</ref>

Atrial kick is absent if there is loss of normal electrical conduction in the heart, such as during [[atrial fibrillation]], [[atrial flutter]], and [[third degree heart block|complete heart block]]. Atrial kick is also different in character depending on the condition of the heart, such as stiff heart, which is found in patients with diastolic dysfunction.

===Detection of atrial systole===

Electrical systole of the atria begins with the onset of the P wave on the [[Electrocardiogram|ECG]].
The wave of bipolarization (or depolarization) that stimulates both atria to contract at the same time is due to sinoatrial node which is located on the upper wall of the right atrium.

==Ventricular systole==
[[Image:Heart systole.svg|thumb|155px|right|Ventricular systole]]
Ventricular systole is the contraction of the muscles (''myocardia'') of the left and right [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]s.

At the later part of the ejection phase, although the ventricular pressure falls below the aortic pressure, the aortic valve remains open because of the [[Inertial_wave|inertial energy]] of the ejected blood.<ref>[http://www.cvphysiology.com/Heart%20Disease/HD002d.htm Cardiovascular Physiology Concepts by Richard E. Klabunde, Ph.D.: Cardiac Cycle - Reduced Ejection (Phase 4)]</ref>

The graph of aortic pressure throughout the cardiac cycle displays a small dip (the "incisure" or "dicrotic notch") which coincides with the aortic valve closure. The dip in the graph is immediately followed by a brief rise (the "dicrotic wave") then gradual decline. Just as the ventricles enter into diastole, the brief reversal of flow from the aorta back into the left ventricle causes the aortic valves to shut. This results in the slight increase in aortic pressure caused by the elastic recoil of the semilunar valves and aorta.<ref>[http://facstaff.elon.edu/shouse/physiology/frog/plethys/frogplethys.html Plethysmograph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://faculty.ucc.edu/biology-potter/heart.htm The Heart<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.susqu.edu/facstaff/r/richard/ECGlab.html Human Cardiopulmonary Physiology<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The total volume of blood remaining in the ventricle just at the end of the ventricular contraction is called ''[[end-systolic volume]]'' (ESV).

===Detection of ventricular systole===
====Heart sounds====
{{Main|Heart sounds}}
The closing of the mitral and tricuspid valves (known together as the ''atrioventricular valves'') at the '''beginning''' of ventricular systole cause the first part of the "lubb-dubb" sound made by the heart as it beats. Formally, this sound is known as the ''First Heart Tone'', or '''S<sub>1</sub>'''. This first heart tone is created by the closure of mitral and tricuspid valve and is actually a two component sound, M1, T1. 

The second part of the "lub-dubb" (the ''Second Heart Tone'', or '''S<sub>2</sub>'''), is caused by the closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves at the '''end''' of ventricular systole. As the left ventricle empties, its pressure falls below the pressure in the aorta, and the [[aortic valve]] closes. Similarly, as the pressure in the right ventricle falls below the pressure in the pulmonary artery, the [[pulmonary valve]] closes. The second heart sound is also two components, A2 and P2. The aortic valve closes earlier than the pulmonary valve and they are audibly separated from each other in the second heart sound. This "splitting" of S2 is only audible during inhalation. However, some cardiac conduction abnormalities such as [[left bundle branch block]] (LBBB) allow the P2 sound to be heard before the A2 sound during expiration. With LBBB, inhalation brings A2 and P2 closer together where they cannot be audibly distinguished.

====Electrocardiogram====
In an [[electrocardiogram]], electrical systole of the ventricles begins at the beginning of the [[QRS complex]].

==Diastole==
[[Image:Heart diastole.png|thumb|right|Cardiac diastole]]
'''Cardiac Diastole''' is the period of time when the heart relaxes after contraction in preparation for refilling with circulating blood. '''Ventricular diastole''' is when the ventricles are relaxing, while '''atrial diastole''' is when the atria are relaxing. Together they are known as '''complete cardiac diastole'''.

During ventricular diastole, the pressure in the (left and right) ventricles drops from the peak that it reaches in [[Systole (medicine)|systole]]. When the pressure in the left ventricle drops to below the pressure in the left atrium, the [[mitral valve]] opens, and the left ventricle fills with blood that was accumulating in the left atrium. The [[isovolumic relaxation time]] (IVRT) is the interval from the aortic component of the second [[heart sound]], that is, closure of the [[aortic valve]], to onset of filling by opening of the mitral valve.<ref>''Inductance cardiography (thoracocardiography): A novel, noninvasive technique for monitoring left ventricular filling.'' Journal of Critical Care, Volume 14, Issue 4, Pages 177-185</ref> Likewise, when the pressure in the right ventricle drops below that in the right atrium, the [[tricuspid valve]] opens, and the right ventricle fills with blood that was accumulating in the right atrium.
During diastole the pressure within the left ventricle is lower than that in aorta, allowing blood to circulate in the heart itself via the [[coronary arteries]].

==Regulation of the cardiac cycle==
Cardiac muscle has [[Cardiac muscle automaticity|automaticity]], which means that it is self-exciting. The muscle contractions are [[Myogenic contraction|myogenic]], or generated by the muscle cell itself. This is in contrast with [[skeletal muscle]], which requires nervous stimuli (either conscious or reflex) for excitation. The heart's rhythmic contractions occur spontaneously, although the rate of contraction can be changed by nervous or hormonal influences, exercise and emotions. For example, the [[sympathetic nerve]] accelerates heart rate and the [[vagus nerve]] decelerates heart rate.

The rhythmic sequence of contractions is coordinated by the [[sinoatrial]] (SA) and [[atrioventricular node|atrioventricular]] (AV) nodes. The sinoatrial node, often known as the ''[[cardiac pacemaker]]'', is located in the upper wall of the right atrium and is responsible for the wave of electrical stimulation that initiates atrial contraction by creating an [[action potential]]. Once the wave reaches the AV node, situated in the lower right atrium, it is delayed there before being conducted through the bundles of ''His'' and back up the [[Purkinje fibers]], leading to a contraction of the ventricles. The delay at the AV node allows enough time for all of the blood in the atria to fill their respective ventricles. In the event of severe pathology, the AV node can also act as a pacemaker; this is usually not the case because their rate of spontaneous firing is considerably lower than that of the pacemaker cells in the SA node and hence is overridden.
