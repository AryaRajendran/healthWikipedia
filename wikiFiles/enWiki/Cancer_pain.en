'''Pain in cancer''' may arise from a tumor compressing or infiltrating tissue; from treatments and diagnostic procedures; or from skin, nerve and other changes caused by the body's immune response or hormones released by the tumor. Most acute (short-term) [[pain]] is caused by treatment or diagnostic procedures, though [[radiotherapy]] and [[chemotherapy]] may produce painful conditions that persist long after treatment has ended.

At any given time, about half of all patients with [[malignant]] [[cancer]] are experiencing pain and more than a third of those experience moderate or severe pain that diminishes their [[quality of life]] by adversely affecting sleep, social relations and [[activities of daily living]].<ref name = Marcus2011>{{vcite journal |author=Marcus DA |title=Epidemiology of cancer pain |journal=Curr Pain Headache Rep |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=231–4 |year=2011 |month=August |pmid=21556709 |doi=10.1007/s11916-011-0208-0 |url=}}</ref><ref name = Gorin>{{cite journal |author=Sheinfeld Gorin S, Krebs P, Badr H, ''et al.'' |title=Meta-analysis of psychosocial interventions to reduce pain in patients with cancer |journal=J.

Cancer pain can be eliminated or well controlled in 80 to 90 percent of cases by the use of drugs (such as morphine) and other interventions, but nearly one in two patients receives less-than-optimal care. Treatment guidelines for the use of drugs in the management of cancer pain have been published by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO)<ref name = WHO_1996/> and other organizations.<ref name = guidelines/> Healthcare professionals have an ethical obligation to ensure that, whenever possible, the patient or patient's guardian is well-informed about the risks and benefits associated with their [[pain management]] options. Adequate pain management may sometimes slightly shorten a dying patient's life.

The majority of patients with chronic pain notice memory and attention difficulties.

The [[sense|sensation]] of pain is distinct from its unpleasantness. For example, it is possible in some cases, through [[psychosurgery]] or drug treatment, to remove the unpleasantness from pain without affecting its intensity, and suggestion, as in [[hypnosis]] and [[placebo]], can also sometimes temporarily reduce pain's unpleasantness while leaving its intensity unchanged. Some drug therapies and other interventions can remove both the sensation of pain and its unpleasantness, and certain emotional states, such as the excitement of sport or war, can produce the same effect.<ref name="Melzack_1968">{{vcite book | author =  [[Ronald Melzack|Melzack R]]&[[Kenneth L.

Cancer pain is classed as [[Pain#Duration|acute]] (short term) – usually caused by medical investigation or treatment – or [[Chronic pain|chronic]] (long-lasting).<ref>{{cite book|author2=Conn M|author1=Portenoy RK|title=Cancer Pain: Assessment and Management|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_OYWqEAiGCQC&pg=PA8|chapter=Cancer pain syndromes|editor=Bruera ED & Portenoy RK| date=23 June 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77332-4|page=8}}</ref> About 75 percent of patients with chronic cancer pain have pain caused by the cancer itself.

Despite pain being well controlled by long-acting drugs or other treatment, flares may occasionally be felt; this is called breakthrough pain, and is treated with quick-acting analgesics.<ref name = Induru/>

The patient's report is the best measure of pain; they will usually be asked to estimate intensity on a scale of 0–10 (with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain they have ever felt).<ref name = Induru/>

==Cause==
Pain in cancer is produced by pressure on, or chemical stimulation of, specialised pain-signalling nerve endings called [[nociceptor]]s ([[nociceptive pain]]), or it may be caused by damage or illness affecting [[Somatosensory system|nerve fibers]] themselves ([[neuropathic pain]]). Between 40 and 80 percent of patients with cancer pain experience neuropathic pain.<ref name=Kurita>{{vcite journal |author=Kurita GP, Ulrich A, Jensen TS, Werner MU, Sjøgren P |title=How is neuropathic cancer pain assessed in randomised controlled trials? |journal=Pain |volume=153 |issue=1 |pages=13–7 |year=2012 |month=January |pmid=21903329|doi=10.1016/j.pain.2011.08.013 |url=}}</ref>

===Infection===
Infection of a tumor or its surrounding tissue can cause rapidly escalating pain, but is sometimes overlooked as a possible cause of pain. One study<ref name = Gonzalez>{{vcite journal | author = Gonzalez GR, Foley KM & Portenoy RK | year = 1989 | Title = Evaluative skills necessary for a cancer pain consultant | journal = American Pain Society meeting, Phoenix Arizona}}</ref> found that infection was the cause of pain in four percent of nearly 300 cancer patients referred for pain relief. Another report<ref name = Bruera>{{vcite journal | author = Bruera E & MacDonald RN | title = Intractable pain in patients with advanced head and neck tumors: a possible role of local infection | journal = Cancer treatment reports | volume = 70 | pages = 691–2 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3708626 }}</ref> described seven patients, whose previously well-controlled pain escalated significantly over several days. Antibiotic treatment produced pain relief in all patients within three days.<ref name = Twycross/>

===Tumor-related===
Tumors can cause pain by crushing or infiltrating tissue, or by releasing chemicals that make nociceptors responsive to stimuli that are normally non-painful (''cf.'' [[allodynia]]).

====Nervous system====
Brain tissue itself contains no nociceptors; [[brain tumor]]s cause pain by pressing on blood vessels or the membrane that encapsulates the brain (the [[meninges]]), or indirectly by causing a build-up of fluid ([[edema]]) which may compress pain-sensitive tissue.<ref name = Fitzgibbon_&_Loeser_34>{{harvnb|Fitzgibbon|Loeser|2010|p=34}}</ref>

Ten percent of patients with disseminated cancer develop [[meningeal carcinomatosis]], where [[metastatic seedling]]s develop in the meninges of both the brain and spinal cord (with possible invasion of the brain or spinal cord). [[Melanoma]] and [[breast cancer|breast]] and [[lung cancer]] account for 90 percent of such cases. Back pain and headache&nbsp;– often severe and possibly associated with nausea, vomiting, neck rigidity and pain or discomfort in the eyes due to light exposure ([[photophobia]])&nbsp;– are frequently the first symptoms of meningeal carcinomatosis. "Pins and needles" ([[paresthesia]]), bowel or bladder dysfunction and lower [[motor neuron]] weakness are common features.<ref name = Urch/>

[[File:Gray82.png|thumb|right|alt=Drawing of a human vertebra|Fig. 1: A human vertebra showing body and pedicle]]
About three percent of cancer patients experience spinal cord compression, usually from expansion of the [[vertebral body]] or [[pedicle of vertebral arch|pedicle]] ([[#fig. 1|fig. 1]]) due to metastasis, sometimes involving collapse of the vertebral body. Occasionally compression is caused by nonvertebral metastasis adjacent to the spinal cord. Compression of a [[Posterior root of spinal nerve|spinal nerve root]] ([[#fig. 5|fig. 5]]) produces [[radicular pain]], and compression of the long tracts of the cord itself produces [[funicular pain]]. Seventy percent of cases involve the thoracic, 20 percent the [[Lumbar vertebrae|lumbar]], and 10 percent the [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical spine]]; and about 20 percent of cases involve multiple sites of compression. The nature of the pain depends on the location of the compression.<ref name = Twycross/>

Between one and five percent of cancer patients suffer [[peripheral neuropathy]] due to infiltration or compression of  a nerve by a primary tumor.<ref name = Twycross/> 

[[Small-cell carcinoma|Small-cell lung cancer]] and, less often, [[Breast cancer|cancer of the breast]], [[Colorectal cancer|colon]] or [[Ovarian cancer|ovary]] may produce inflammation of the [[dorsal root ganglion|dorsal root ganglia]] ([[#fig. 5|fig. 5]]), precipitating burning, tingling pain in the extremities, with occasional "lightning" or lancinating pains.<ref name = Twycross/><ref name = Foley>{{vcite book | author = Foley KM | year = 2004 |chapter = Acute and chronic cancer pain syndromes | pages = 298–316 | title = Oxford textbook of palliative medicine | editor = Doyle D, Hanks G, Cherny N & Calman K | publisher = OUP | location = Oxford | isbn = 0-19-851098-5 }}</ref>

[[Brachial plexopathy]] is a common product of [[Pancoast tumor]], [[lymphoma]] and [[breast cancer]], and can produce severe burning [[dysesthesia|dysesthesic]] pain on the back of the hand, and cramping, crushing forearm pain.<ref name = Twycross/>

====Bone====
{{ anchor |fig. 2}}
[[File:Illu pharynx.jpg|thumb|left|Fig. 2: Cross-section of the human head showing the nasopharynx]]
Invasion of bone by cancer is the most common source of cancer pain. About 70 percent of breast and [[prostate cancer]] patients, and 40 percent of those with [[Lung cancer|lung]], [[Kidney cancer|kidney]] and [[thyroid cancer]]s develop bone [[Metastasis|metastases]]. It is commonly felt as tenderness, with constant background pain and instances of spontaneous or movement-related exacerbation, and is frequently described as severe. Tumors in the marrow instigate a vigorous immune response which enhances pain sensitivity, and they release chemicals that stimulate nociceptors. As they grow, tumors compress, [[proteolysis|consume]], infiltrate or cut off blood supply to body tissues, which can cause pain.<ref name = Twycross>{{vcite book | author = Twycross R & Bennett M | chapter = Cancer pain syndromes | editor = Sykes N, Bennett MI & Yuan C-S | title = Clinical pain management: Cancer pain | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-0-340-94007-5 | publisher = Hodder Arnold | location = London | pages = 27–37 | year = 2008 }}</ref><ref name = Urch>{{vcite book | author = Urch CE & Suzuki R | chapter = Pathophysiology of somatic, visceral, and neuropathic cancer pain | editor = Sykes N, Bennett MI & Yuan C-S | title = Clinical pain management: Cancer pain | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-0-340-94007-5 | publisher = Hodder Arnold | location = London | pages = 3–12 | year = 2008 }}</ref>

Rib fractures, common in breast, prostate and other cancers with rib metastases, can cause brief severe pain on twisting the trunk, coughing, laughing, breathing deeply or moving between sitting and lying.<ref name = Twycross/>

The base of the skull may be affected by metastases from cancer of the [[bronchus]], breast or prostate, or cancer may spread directly to this area from the [[nasopharynx]] ([[#fig. 2|fig. 2]]), and this may cause headache, facial paresthesia, [[dysesthesia]] or pain, or cranial nerve dysfunction&nbsp;– the exact symptoms depending on the cranial nerves impacted.<ref name = Twycross/>

====Pelvis====
Pain produced by cancer within the pelvis varies depending on the affected tissue, but it frequently radiates diffusely to the upper thigh, and may [[referred pain|refer]] to the [[lumbar]] region. [[Lumbosacral plexus|Lumbosacral]] [[plexopathy]] is often caused by recurrence of cancer in the [[presacral space]], and may refer to the external genitalia or [[perineum]]. Local recurrence of cancer attached to the side of the [[pelvic wall]] may cause pain in one of the [[iliac fossa]]e. Pain on walking that confines the patient to bed indicates possible cancer adherence to or invasion of the [[iliacus muscle]]. Pain in the [[hypogastrium]] (between the navel and [[pubis (bone)|pubic bone]]) is often found in cancers of the uterus and bladder, and sometimes in [[colorectal cancer]] especially if infiltrating or attached to either uterus or bladder.<ref name = Twycross/>

====Viscera====
[[Visceral pain]] is diffuse and difficult to locate, and is often referred to more distant, usually superficial, sites.<ref name = Urch/>

A tumor can expand the size of the liver several times, and consequent stretching of its [[Fibrous capsule of Glisson|capsule]] can cause aching pain in the right [[hypochondrium]]. Other causes of pain in [[Hepatomegaly|enlarged liver]] are traction of the supporting ligaments when standing or walking, internal bleeding of the liver, the liver pressing against the rib cage or pinching the wall of the abdomen, and straining the lumbar spine. In some postures the liver may pinch the parietal [[peritoneum]] against the lower rib cage, producing sharp, transitory pain, relieved by changing position. The tumor may also infiltrate the liver's capsule, causing dull, and sometimes stabbing pain.<ref name = Twycross/>

Cancer of the kidneys and spleen produces less pain than that caused by liver tumor&nbsp;– kidney tumors eliciting pain only once the organ has been almost totally destroyed and the cancer has invaded the surrounding tissue or adjacent pelvis. Pressure on the kidney or [[ureter]] from a tumor outside the kidney can cause extreme flank pain.<ref name = Fitzgibbon_&_Loeser_34/> Local recurrence of cancer after the removal of a kidney can cause pain in the lumbar back, or [[Lumbar spinal nerve 1|L1]] or [[Lumbar spinal nerve 2|L2]] spinal nerve pain in the groin or upper thigh, accompanied by weakness and numbness of the [[iliopsoas]] muscle, exacerbated by activity.<ref name = Twycross/>

The pain of intestinal tumors may be the result of disturbed [[motility]], dilation, altered blood flow or [[ulcer]]ation. [[Lymphoma|Malignant lymphomas]] of the gastrointestinal tract can produce large tumors with significant ulceration and bleeding. Inflammation of artery walls and tissue adjacent to nerves is common in tumors of abdominal and urogenital hollow organs.<ref name = Fitzgibbon_&_Loeser_35>{{harvnb|Fitzgibbon|Loeser|2010|p=35}}</ref>

Cancer in the [[bronchial tree]] is usually painless,<ref name = Fitzgibbon_&_Loeser_35/> but ear and facial pain on one side of the head has been reported in some patients. This pain is referred via the [[auricular branch of vagus nerve|auricular branch of the vagus nerve]].<ref name = Twycross/>

{{anchor | fig. 3}}
[[File:Illu pancreas duodenum.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Drawing of the pancreas|Fig. 3 The [[pancreas]]: 1. pancreatic head; 4. pancreatic body; 11. pancreatic tail]]

Ten percent of patients with cancer of the [[pancreatic body]] or [[Tail of pancreas|tail]] experience pain, whereas 90 percent of those with cancer of the pancreatic [[Head of pancreas|head]] will, especially if the tumor is near the [[hepatopancreatic ampulla]]. The pain appears on the left or right upper abdomen, is constant, and increases in intensity over time. It is in some cases relieved by leaning forward and heightened by lying on the stomach. Back pain may be present and, if intense, may spread left and right. Back pain may be referred from the pancreas, or may indicate the cancer has penetrated [[paraspinal muscle]], or entered the [[retroperitoneum]] and [[paraaortic lymph node]]s<ref name = Twycross/>

Pain of the [[rectum]] may be experienced even after the rectum has been [[Abdominoperineal resection|surgically removed]]. Local recurrence of [[Colorectal cancer|rectal cancer]] may cause mild (described as "pressure") or strong pain on sitting; or pain on standing or walking (described as "dragging"). The latter may indicate a deeper recurrence involving attachment to muscle or [[fascia]]. A local tumor in the rectum or recurrence involving the [[Superior hypogastric plexus|presacral plexus]] may cause pain normally associated with an urgent need to defecate. This pain may, rarely, be [[phantom pain|phantom]] after surgical removal of the rectum. Distressing, intense, stabbing, "red hot poker" pain is sometimes reported. Pain within a few weeks of surgical removal of the rectum is usually neuropathic pain due to the surgery, and described in one study<ref name = Boas>{{vcite journal | author = Boas RA, Schug SA & Acland RH | title = Perineal pain after rectal amputation: A 5 year follow up | journal = Pain | year = 1993 | volume = 52 | pages = 62–70 | pmid = 8446438 | doi=10.1016/0304-3959(93)90115-6}}</ref> as spontaneous, intermittent, mild to moderate shooting and bursting, or tight and aching. Pain emerging after three months usually signals recurrence, and was described as deep, sharp, aching, intense, and continuous, made worse by sitting or pressure. In over half of patients with late-onset pain in the above study, pain was ameliorated by [[analgesic]]s.<ref name = Twycross/>

Infection or cancer may irritate the [[trigone of the urinary bladder]], causing spasm of the [[detrusor urinae muscle]] (the muscle that squeezes urine from the [[urinary bladder]]), resulting in deep pain above the pubic bone, possibly referred to the tip of the penis, lasting from a few minutes to half an hour.<ref name = Twycross/>

====Serous mucosa====
[[Carcinosis]] of the [[peritoneum]] may cause pain through pressure of the metastases on nerves, inflammation, or disordered visceral motility. Once a tumor has penetrated or perforated hollow viscera, acute inflammation of the peritoneum appears, inducing severe abdominal pain. [[Pleura]]l [[carcinomatosis]] is normally painless.<ref name = Fitzgibbon_&_Loeser_35/>

====Soft tissue====
Invasion of soft tissue by a tumor can cause pain by inflammatory or mechanical stimulation of nociceptors, or destruction of mobile structures such as ligaments, tendons and skeletal muscles.<ref name = Fitzgibbon_&_Loeser_35/>

===Treatment-related===
Potentially painful interventions in cancer treatment include [[immunotherapy]] which may produce joint or muscle pain; radiotherapy, which can cause skin reactions, [[enteritis]], fibrosis, [[myelopathy]], bone [[necrosis]], [[neuropathy]] or [[plexopathy]]; chemotherapy, often associated with [[mucositis]], [[arthralgia|joint pain]], [[myalgia|muscle pain]], peripheral neuropathy and abdominal pain due to diarrhea or constipation; hormone therapy, which sometimes causes pain flares; targeted therapies, such as [[trastuzumab]] and [[rituximab]], which can cause muscle, joint or chest pain; [[angiogenesis inhibitor]]s like [[bevacizumab]], known to sometimes cause bone pain; and surgery, which may produce post-operative pain, post-amputation pain or pelvic floor myalgia. Some diagnostic procedures, such as [[venipuncture]], [[paracentesis]], and [[thoracentesis]] can be painful.<ref name=IASP>[http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=7191 International Association for the Study of Pain] Treatment-Related Pain</ref> In one study, 10 percent of patients felt pain on the placement of a catheter, 14 percent on lumbar puncture, and 70 percent undergoing bone marrow aspirate or biopsy.<ref name = Abraham>{{vcite book | author = Abraham JL | title = A physician's guide to pain and symptom management in cancer patients | page = 108 | edition = 2 | year = 2005 | publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn = 0801881013}}</ref>

====Chemotherapy====
[[File:Chemotherapy bottles NCI.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Six medicine bottles.|Fig. 4: Chemotherapy drugs]]

Chemotherapy may cause mucositis, muscle pain, joint pain, abdominal pain caused by diarrhea or constipation, and peripheral neuropathy<ref name=IASP/>

=====Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy=====
Between 30 and 40 percent of patients undergoing chemotherapy experience chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes progressing to the arms and legs.<ref name = NCI>{{vcite journal | author = del Pino BM | date = Feb 23, 2010 | journal = NCI Cancer Bulletin | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | page = 6 | title = Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy | url = http://www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/ncicancerbulletin/archive/2010/022310/page6}}</ref> Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include [[thalidomide]], the [[epothilone]]s such as [[ixabepilone]], the [[vinca alkaloid]]s [[vincristine]] and [[vinblastine]], the [[taxane]]s [[paclitaxel]] and [[docetaxel]], the [[proteasome inhibitor]]s such as [[bortezomib]], and the platinum-based drugs [[cisplatin]], [[oxaliplatin]] and [[carboplatin]].<ref name = NCI/><ref>http://www.kup.at/kup/pdf/10376.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.ehealthme.com/ds/herceptin/peripheral%20sensory%20neuropathy</ref> Whether CIPN arises, and to what degree, is determined by the choice of drug, duration of use, the total amount consumed and whether the patient already has peripheral neuropathy. Though the symptoms are mainly sensory – pain, tingling, numbness and temperature sensitivity – in some cases [[motor nerve]]s are affected, and occasionally, also, the [[autonomic nervous system]].<ref name = Beijers>{{vcite journal | author = Beijers AJM, Jongen, JLM & Vreugdenhil1 G | date = January 2012 | journal = The Netherlands journal of medicine | volume = 70 | issue = 1 |pmid = 22271810 | url = http://www.njmonline.nl/getpdf.php?id=10000794}}</ref>

CIPN often follows the first chemotherapy dose and increases in severity as treatment continues, but this progression usually levels off at completion of treatment. The platinum-based drugs are the exception; with these drugs, sensation may continue to deteriorate for several months after the end of treatment.<ref name= Windebank>{{vcite journal | author = Windebank AJ & Grisold W | title = Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy | journal =  Journal of the Peripheral Nervous System | date = 2008 Mar | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–46 | pmid = 18346229}}</ref> Some CIPN appears to be irreversible.<ref name= Windebank/> Pain can often be helped with drug or other treatment but the numbness is usually resistant to treatment.<ref name=Savage>{{vcite journal | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute| title = Chemotherapy-induced pain puzzles scientists | volume = 99 | issue = 14 | author = Savage L | date = 2007 | url = http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/14/1070.long | pages = 1070–1071}}</ref>

CIPN disrupts leisure, work and family relations, and the pain of CIPN is often accompanied by sleep and mood disturbance, fatigue and functional difficulties. A 2007 American study found that most patients did not recall being told to expect CIPN, and doctors monitoring the condition rarely asked how it affects daily living but focused on practical effects such as dexterity and gait.<ref name = Paice/> It is not known what causes the condition, but  [[microtubule]] and [[mitochondria]]l damage, and leaky blood vessels near nerve cells are some of the possibilities being explored. It is unknown what percentage of patients are affected.<ref name= Windebank/>

As possible preventative interventions, the American [[National Cancer Institute]] Symptom Management and Health-related Quality of Life Steering Committee recommends continued investigation of [[glutathione]], and intravenous calcium and magnesium, which have shown early promise in limited human trials; [[acetyl-L-carnitine]], which was effective in animal models and on diabetes and HIV patients; and the anti-oxidant [[alpha-lipoic acid]].<ref name = NCI/>

=====Mucositis=====
Cancer drugs can cause changes in the biochemistry of mucous membranes resulting in intense pain in the mouth, throat, nasal passages, and gastrointestinal tract. This pain can make talking, drinking, or eating difficult or impossible.<ref name = Fitzgibbon_&_Loeser_39>{{harvnb|Fitzgibbon|Loeser|2010|p=39}}</ref>

=====Muscle and joint pain=====
Withdrawal of steroid medication can cause joint pain and diffuse muscle pain accompanied by fatigue; these symptoms resolve with recommencement of steroid therapy. Chronic steroid therapy can result in aseptic necrosis of the humoral or femoral head, resulting in shoulder or knee pain described as dull and aching, and reduced movement in or inability to use arm or hip. Aromatase inhibitors can cause diffuse muscle and joint pain and stiffness, and may increase the likelihood of osteoporosis and consequent fractures.<ref name = Fitzgibbon_&_Loeser_39/>

====Radiotherapy====
Radiotherapy may affect the connective tissue surrounding nerves, and may damage or kill white or gray matter in the brain or spinal cord.

=====Fibrosis around the brachial or lumbosacral plexus=====
Radiotherapy may produce [[fibrosis|excessive growth]] of the fibrous tissue enveloping the [[brachial plexus]] or [[lumbosacral plexus]], which can result in damage to the nerves over time (6 months to 20 years). This nerve damage may cause numbness, "pins and needles" (dysesthesia) and weakness in the affected limb. If pain develops, it is described as diffuse, severe, burning pain, increasing over time, in part or all of the affected limb.<ref name = Fitzgibbon_&_Loeser_39/>

=====Spinal cord damage=====
If radiotherapy includes the spinal cord, changes may occur which do not become apparent until some time after treatment. "Early delayed radiation-induced myelopathy" can manifest from six weeks to six months after treatment; the usual symptom is a [[Lhermitte sign]] ("a brief, unpleasant sensation of numbness, tingling and often electric-like discharge going from the neck to the spine and extremities, triggered by neck flexion"), usually followed by improvement two to nine months after onset, though in some cases symptoms persist for a long time. "Late delayed radiation-induced myelopathy" may occur six months to ten years after treatment. The typical presentation is [[Brown-Séquard syndrome]] (a motor deficit and numbness to touch and vibration on one side of the body and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the other). Onset may be sudden but is usually progressive. Some patients improve and others deteriorate.<ref name = Fitzgibbon_&_Loeser_102-3>{{harvnb|Fitzgibbon|Loeser|2010|pp=102–3}}</ref>

==Management==
{{main|Pain management|Palliative care}}
Cancer pain treatment is directed toward relieving pain with minimal adverse treatment effects, allowing the patient a good [[quality of life]] and level of function and a relatively painless death.<ref name = Schug/> Though 80–90 percent of cancer pain can be eliminated or well controlled, nearly half of all patients with cancer pain (including those in developed countries) receive less than optimal care.<ref name = Deandrea>{{vcite journal | author = Deandrea S, Montanari M, Moja L, Apolone G | title = Prevalence of undertreatment in cancer pain.

Cancer is a dynamic process, and pain interventions need to reflect this. Several different treatment modalities may be required over time, as the disease progresses. Pain managers should clearly explain to the patient the cause of the pain and the various treatment possibilities, and should consider, as well as drug therapy, directly modifying the underlying disease, raising the pain threshold, interrupting, destroying or stimulating pain pathways, and suggesting lifestyle modification.<ref name = Schug>{{vcite book | author = Schug SA & Auret K | chapter = Clinical pharmacology: Principles of analgesic drug management | editor = Sykes N, Bennett MI & Yuan C-S | title = Clinical pain management: Cancer pain | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-0-340-94007-5 | publisher = Hodder Arnold | location = London | pages = 104–22 | year = 2008 }}</ref> The relief of psychological, social and spiritual distress is a key element in effective pain management.<ref name = WHO_1996>WHO guidelines:

===Psychological===

====Coping strategies====
How a person responds to pain affects the intensity of pain (moderately), the degree of disability they experience, and the impact of pain on their quality of life. Strategies employed by patients to cope with pain include enlisting the help of others, persisting with tasks despite pain, distraction, rethinking maladaptive ideas, and prayer or ritual.<ref name = Porter&Keefe>{{cite journal |author=Porter LS, Keefe FJ |title=Psychosocial issues in cancer pain |journal=Curr Pain Headache Rep |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=263–70 |year=2011 |month=August |pmid=21400251 |doi=10.1007/s11916-011-0190-6 |url=}}</ref>

Some people in pain tend to focus on and exaggerate the threat value of painful stimuli, and estimate their own ability to deal with pain as poor. This tendency is termed "catastrophizing."<ref name = Rosenstiel>{{vcite journal |author=Rosenstiel AK, Keefe FJ |title=The use of coping strategies in chronic low back pain patients: relationship to patient characteristics and current adjustment |journal=Pain |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=33–44 |year=1983 |month=September |pmid=6226916 |doi= 10.1016/0304-3959(83)90125-2 |url=}}</ref> The few studies so far conducted into catastrophizing in cancer pain have suggested that it is associated with higher levels of pain and psychological distress. Cancer pain patients who accept that pain will persist and nevertheless are able to engage in a meaningful life were less susceptible to catastrophizing and depression in one study. Patients who are usually high in the trait, "hope" (defined as the ability to see pathways to desired goals coupled with the motivation to use those pathways), were found in two studies to experience much lower levels of pain, fatigue and depression.<ref name = Porter&Keefe/> 

Patients who are confident in their understanding of their condition and its treatment, and confident in their ability to (a) control their symptoms, (b) collaborate successfully with their informal carers and (c) communicate effectively with health care providers experience better pain outcomes. Physicians should therefore take steps to encourage and facilitate effective patient communication, and should consider [[psychosocial]] intervention.<ref name = Porter&Keefe/>

====Psychosocial interventions====
Psychosocial interventions do affect the amount of pain experienced and the degree to which it interferes with daily life,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sheinfeld Gorin S, Krebs P, Badr H, ''et al.'' |title=Meta-analysis of psychosocial interventions to reduce pain in patients with cancer |journal=J.

Psychosocial interventions include education (addressing among other things the correct use of analgesic medications and effective communication with clinicians),<ref name = Gorin/> which modestly but reliably reduces the amount of pain experienced by the patient, and coping-skills training (changing thoughts, emotions, and behaviors through training in skills such as problem solving, relaxation, distraction and [[cognitive restructuring]]), which reduces psychological distress and improves [[quality of life]] in cancer patients. Education may be more helpful to patients with [[Cancer staging|stage I]] cancer and their carers, and coping-skills training may be more helpful at stages II and III.<ref name = Porter&Keefe/>

The patient's adjustment to cancer depends vitally on the support of their partner and other informal carers, but pain can seriously disrupt such interpersonal relationships, so patients and therapists should consider involving partners and other informal carers in psychosocial therapeutic interventions.<ref name = Porter&Keefe/>

===Medications===
The WHO guidelines<ref name = WHO_1996/> recommend prompt oral administration of drugs when pain occurs, starting, if the patient is not in severe pain, with non-opioid drugs such as [[paracetamol]], [[dipyrone]], [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s or [[COX-2 inhibitor]]s.<ref name = WHO_1996/> Then, if complete pain relief is not achieved or disease progression necessitates more aggressive treatment, mild opioids such as [[codeine]], [[dextropropoxyphene]], [[dihydrocodeine]] or [[tramadol]] are added to the existing non-opioid regime. If this is or becomes insufficient, mild opioids are replaced by stronger opioids such as morphine, while continuing the non-opioid therapy, escalating opioid dose until the patient is painless or the maximum possible relief without intolerable side effects has been achieved. If the initial presentation is severe cancer pain, this stepping process should be skipped and a strong opioid should be started immediately in combination with a non-opioid analgesic.<ref name = Schug/>

The usefulness of the second step (mild opioids) is being debated in the clinical and research communities. Some authors challenge the pharmacological validity of the step and, pointing to their higher toxicity and low efficacy, argue that mild opioids could be replaced by small doses of strong opioids (with the possible exception of tramadol due to its demonstrated efficacy in cancer pain, its specificity for neuropathic pain, and its low sedative properties and reduced potential for respiratory depression in comparison to conventional opioids).<ref name =Schug/>

[[Antiemetic]] and [[laxative]] treatment should be commenced concurrently with strong opioids, to counteract the usual nausea and constipation. Nausea normally resolves after two or three weeks of treatment but laxatives will need to be aggressively maintained. More than half of patients with advanced cancer and pain will need strong opioids, and these in combination with non-opioids can produce acceptable analgesia in 70–90 percent of cases. Sedation and cognitive impairment usually occur with the initial dose or a significant increase in dosage of a strong opioid, but improve after a week or two of consistent dosage.<ref name = Schug/>

Analgesics should not be taken "on demand" but "by the clock" (every 3–6 hours), with each dose delivered before the preceding dose has worn off, in doses sufficiently high to ensure continuous pain relief. Patients taking slow-release morphine should also be provided with immediate-release ("rescue") morphine to use as necessary, for pain spikes ([[breakthrough pain]]) that are not suppressed by the regular medication.<ref name = Schug/>

Oral analgesia is the cheapest, simplest and most acceptable mode of delivery. Other delivery routes such as [[Sublingual administration|sublingual]], topical, [[parenteral]], rectal or spinal should be considered if the need is urgent, or in case of vomiting, impaired swallow, obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption or coma.<ref name = Schug/> 

Liver and kidney disease can affect the biological activity of analgesics. When such patients are treated with oral opioids they must be monitored for the possible need to reduce dose, extend dosing intervals, or switch to other opioids or other modes of delivery.<ref name = Schug/> Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be especially beneficial in some pain conditions but their benefit should be weighed against their gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risks.<ref name =Portenoy/>

Not all pain yields completely to classic analgesics, and drugs that are not traditionally considered analgesics but which reduce pain in some cases, such as [[steroids]] or [[bisphosphonates]], may be employed concurrently with analgesics at any stage. [[Tricyclic antidepressants]], class I [[Antiarrhythmic agent|antiarrhythmics]], or [[anticonvulsants]] are the drugs of choice for neuropathic pain. Up to 90 percent of patients at death are using such "[[adjuvant]]s". Many adjuvants carry a significant risk of serious complications.<ref name = Schug/>

Anxiety reduction can reduce the unpleasantness of pain but is least effective for moderate and severe pain.<ref name = Price>{{vcite book| author = Price DD, Riley JL & Wade JB | year = 2001 | chapter = Psychophysical approaches to measurement of the dimensions and stages of pain | editor = Turk DC & Melzack R | title = Handbook of pain assessment | publisher = Guildford Press | Location = NY | isbn = 1-57230-488-X | page = 65 }}</ref> Since [[anxiolytic]]s such as [[benzodiazepines]] and major [[tranquilizer]]s add to sedation, they should only be used to address [[anxiety]], depression, disturbed sleep or muscle spasm.<ref name = Schug/>

If the analgesic and adjuvant regimen recommended above does not adequately relieve pain, additional modes of intervention are available.<ref name = Atallah>{{ vcite book | author = Atallah JN | chapter = Management of cancer pain | editor = Vadivelu N, Urman RD, Hines RL | title = Essentials of pain management | publisher = Springer | location = New York | pages = 597–628 | isbn = 978-0-387-87578-1 | doi = 10.1007/978-0-387-87579-8 | year = 2011 }}</ref>

====Radiation====
[[Radiotherapy]] is used when drug treatment is failing to control the pain of a growing tumor, such as in bone metastisis (most commonly), penetration of soft tissue, or compression of sensory nerves. Often, low doses are adequate to produce analgesia, thought to be due to reduction in pressure or, possibly, interference with the tumor's production of pain-promoting chemicals.<ref name = Hoskin>{{ vcite book | author = Hoskin PJ | chapter = Radiotherapy | editor = Sykes N, Bennett MI & Yuan C-S | title = Clinical pain management: Cancer pain | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-0-340-94007-5 | publisher = Hodder Arnold | location = London | pages = 251–55 | year = 2008 }}</ref> [[Radiopharmaceutical]]s that target specific tumors have been used to treat the pain of metastatic illnesses. Relief may occur within a week of treatment and may last from two to four months.<ref name = Atallah/>

====Nerve blocks====
{{anchor | fig. 5}}
[[File:Gray770-en.svg|thumb|right|alt=Drawing of cross-section of spinal cord|Fig. 5: Cross section of the spinal cord showing the subarachnoid cavity, dura mater and spinal nerve roots including the dorsal root [[ganglion]]]]
[[Neurolysis]] is the injury of a nerve. Chemicals, laser, freezing or heating may be used to injure a sensory nerve and so produce degeneration of the nerve's fibers and the fibers' [[myelin sheath]]s, and temporary interference with the transmission of pain signals. In this procedure, the protective casing around the myelin sheath, the [[basal lamina]], is preserved so that, as a damaged fiber (and its myelin sheath) regrows, it travels within its basal lamina and connects with the correct loose end, and function may be restored. Surgical cutting of a nerve severs the basal laminae, and without these tubes to channel the regrowing fibers to their lost connections, deafferentation pain (spontaneous pain due to loss of signal to the spinal cord) may develop. This is why neurolysis is preferred over surgically blocking nerves.<ref name = Williams>{{vcite book | author = Williams JE | chapter = Nerve blocks: Chemical and physical neurolytic agents | editor = Sykes N, Bennett MI & Yuan C-S | title = Clinical pain management: Cancer pain | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-0-340-94007-5 | publisher = Hodder Arnold | location = London | pages = 225–35 | year = 2008 }}</ref> A brief "rehearsal" block using local anesthesia should be tried before the actual neurolytic block, to determine efficacy and detect side effects.<ref name = Atallah/> The aim of this treatment is pain elimination, or the reduction of pain to the point where opioids may be effective.<ref name = Atallah/> Though neurolysis lacks long-term outcome studies and evidence-based guidelines for its use, for patients with progressive cancer and otherwise incurable pain, it can play an essential role.<ref name = Williams/>

Targets for neurolytic block include the [[celiac plexus]], most commonly for cancer of the gastrointestinal tract up to the [[transverse colon]], and pancreatic cancer, but also for stomach cancer, gall bladder cancer, [[Adrenal tumor|adrenal mass]], [[common bile duct]] cancer, chronic [[pancreatitis]] and active intermittent [[porphyria]]; the [[splanchnic nerve]], for [[Retroperitoneal space|retroperitoneal]] pain, and similar conditions to those addressed by the celiac plexus block but, because of its higher rate of complications, used only if the celiac plexus block is not producing adequate relief; [[Inferior hypogastric plexus|hypogastric plexus]], for cancer of the [[descending colon]], [[sigmoid colon]] and rectum, as well as cancers of the bladder, [[prostatic urethra]], prostate, [[seminal vesicle]]s, testicles, uterus, ovary and vaginal fundus (the inner end of the vagina); [[ganglion impar]], for the perinium, vulva, anus, distal (outer end of the) rectum, distal [[urethra]], and distal third of the vagina; the [[stellate ganglion]], usually for head and neck cancer or sympathetically mediated arm and hand pain; the [[intercostal nerves]], which serve the skin of the chest and abdomen; and a dorsal root ganglion may be injured by targeting the root inside the [[subarachnoid space|subarachnoid cavity]] ([[#fig. 5|fig.5]]), most effective for pain in the chest or abdominal wall, but also used for other areas including arm/hand or leg/foot pain.<ref name = Atallah/>

====Cutting or destruction of nervous tissue====
{{anchor | fig. 6}}
[[File:Spinal cord tracts - English.svg| thumb | left |alt=Drawing of cross-section of the spinal cord|Fig. 6:  Cross-section of the spinal cord showing the [[dorsal column]] and the anterolateral [[spinothalamic tract]]s ]]

Surgical cutting or destruction of [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] or [[central nervous system|central]] nervous tissue is now rarely used in the treatment of pain.<ref name = Atallah/> Procedures include  neurectomy, cordotomy, dorsal root entry zone lesioning, and cingulotomy.

[[Neurectomy]] involves cutting a nerve, and is (rarely) used in patients with short life expectancy who are unsuitable for drug therapy due to ineffectiveness or intolerance. The [[dorsal root|dorsal (sensory) root]] or dorsal root ganglion may be usefully targeted (called [[rhizotomy]]); with the dorsal root ganglion possibly the more effective target because some sensory fibers enter the spinal cord from the dorsal root ganglion via the [[ventral root|''ventral'' (motor) root]], and these would not be interrupted by dorsal root neurectomy. Because nerves often carry both sensory and motor fibers, motor impairment is a possible side effect of neurectomy. A common result of this procedure is "deafferentation pain" where, 6–9 months after surgery, pain returns at greater intensity.<ref name = Cosgrove/>

[[Cordotomy]] involves cutting into the [[spinothalamic tract]]s, which run up the front/side (anterolateral) quadrant of the spinal cord, carrying heat and pain signals to the brain ([[#fig. 6|fig. 6]]). Pancoast tumor pain has been effectively treated with dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) lesioning&nbsp;– destruction of a region of the spinal cord where peripheral pain signals cross to spinal cord fibers&nbsp;– this is major surgery, carrying the risk of significant neurological side effects. [[Cingulotomy]] involves cutting the fibers that carry signals directly from the [[cingulate gyrus]] to the [[entorhinal cortex]] in the brain. It reduces the unpleasantness of pain (without affecting its intensity), but may have [[cognition|cognitive]] side effects.<ref name = Cosgrove/>

====Intrathecal programmable pump====
[[File:PCA-01.JPG|thumb|right|Fig. 7: A [[patient-controlled analgesia]] infusion pump, configured for epidural administration of fentanyl and bupivacaine]]

{{main|Intrathecal pump|Patient-controlled analgesia}}
Delivery of an opioid such as [[morphine]], [[hydromorphone]], [[fentanyl]], [[sufentanyl]] and [[meperidine]] directly into the subarachnoid cavity ([[#fig. 5|fig. 5]]) provides enhanced analgesia with reduced systemic side effects, and has reduced the level of pain in otherwise intractable cases. The [[anxiolytic]] [[clonidine]] or the nonopioid analgesic [[ziconotide]], and local anesthetics such as [[bupivacaine]], [[ropivacaine]] or [[tetracaine]] may also be infused along with the opioid.<ref name = Atallah/><ref name = Cosgrove>{{vcite book | author = Cosgrove MA, Towns DK, Fanciullo GJ & Kaye AD | chapter = Interventional pain management | pages = 237–299 | editor = Vadivelu N, Urman RD, Hines RL | title = Essentials of pain management | publisher = Springer | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-387-87578-1 | doi = 10.1007/978-0-387-87579-8 | year = 2011 }}</ref>

====Long-term epidural catheter====
The outer layer of the sheath surrounding the spinal cord is called the [[dura mater]] ([[#fig. 5|fig.5]]). Between this and the surrounding [[vertebra]]e is the [[epidural space]], filled with connective tissue, fat and blood vessels, and crossed by the spinal nerve roots. A [[catheter]] may be inserted into this space for three to six months, to deliver anesthetics or analgesics. The line carrying the drug may be threaded under the skin to emerge at the front of the patient, a process called tunneling, and this is recommended with long term use so as to reduce the chance of any infection at the exit site reaching the epidural space.<ref name = Atallah/>

====Spinal cord stimulation====
Electrical stimulation of the [[dorsal columns]] of the spinal cord ([[#fig. 6|fig. 6]]) can produce analgesia. First, the leads are implanted, guided by the patient's report and  [[fluoroscopy]], and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath the skin of the upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they are attached to the snugly-fitting generator.<ref name = Cosgrove/> It seems to be more helpful with neuropathic and [[ischemia|ischemic]] pain than nociceptive pain, and is not often used in the treatment of cancer pain.<ref name = Johnson>{{ vcite book | author = Johnson MI, Oxberry SG & Robb K | chapter = Stimulation-induced analgesia | pages = 235–250 | editor = Sykes N, Bennett MI & Yuan C-S | title = Clinical pain management: Cancer pain | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-0-340-94007-5 | publisher = Hodder Arnold | location = London | year = 2008 }}</ref>

====Deep brain stimulation====
Ongoing electrical stimulation of structures deep within the brain&nbsp;– the [[periaqueductal gray]] and [[periventricular gray]] for nociceptive pain, and the [[internal capsule]], [[ventral posterolateral nucleus]] and [[ventral posteromedial nucleus]] for neuropathic pain&nbsp;– has produced impressive results with some patients but results vary and appropriate patient selection is important. One study<ref name = Young>{{vcite journal | author = Young RF & Brechner T | title = Electrical stimulation of the brain for relief of intractable pain due to cancer | journal = Cancer | volume = 57 | year = 1986 | pages = 1266–72 | pmid = 3484665}}</ref> of seventeen patients with intractable cancer pain found that thirteen were virtually painless and only four required opioid analgesics on release from hospital after the intervention. Most ultimately did resort to opioids, usually in the last few weeks of life.<ref name = Johnson/>

====Hypophysectomy====
[[Hypophysectomy]] is the destruction of the [[pituitary gland]], and has been used successfully on metastatic breast and prostate cancer pain.<ref name = Cosgrove/>

===Complimentary and alternative medicine===
Due to the poor quality of most studies of [[complementary and alternative medicine]] in relief of cancer pain, it is not possible to recommend integration of these therapies into the management of cancer pain. There is weak evidence for a modest benefit from hypnosis, supportive psychotherapy and cognitive therapy; studies of massage therapy produced mixed results and none found pain relief after 4 weeks; Reiki, and touch therapy results were inconclusive; acupuncture, the most studied such treatment, has demonstrated no benefit as an adjunct analgesic in cancer pain; the evidence for music therapy is equivocal; and some herbal interventions such as PC-SPES, mistletoe, and saw palmetto are known to be toxic to some cancer patients. The most promising evidence, though still weak, is for mind-body interventions such as biofeedback and relaxation techniques.<ref name = Induru/>

many medical care providers lack a broad and deep understanding of key aspects of pain management, including [[nursing assessment|assessment]], [[dose (biochemistry)|dosing]], [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], [[addiction]], and [[adverse effect|side effects]], and many do not know that pain can be well controlled in most cases.<ref name = Paice/><ref name = Schug/> In Canada, for instance, [[veterinarian]]s get five times more training in pain than do physicians, and three times more training than nurses.<ref name = CPS>{{cite web | title = The problem of pain in Canada | url = http://www.canadianpainsummit2012.ca/en/home/about-the-2012-summit/about.aspx#4 | year = 2012 | accessdate = 1 July 2012 | publisher = Canadian Pain Summit }}</ref> Physicians may undertreat pain due to fear of being audited by a regulatory body.<ref name = Induru/>

==Legal and ethical considerations==
The [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] obliges signatory nations to make pain treatment available to those within their borders as a duty under the human right to health. A failure to take reasonable measures to relieve the suffering of those in pain may be seen as failure to protect against inhuman and degrading treatment under Article 5 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].<ref name = PCU>{{cite web | url = http://www.iasp-pain.org/AM/AMTemplate.cfm?Section=HOME&CONTENTID=7636&TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&SECTION=HOME | author = Brennan F & Cousins FJ | date = September 2004 | accessdate = 28 June 2012 | title = Pain Clinical Updates: Pain relief as a human right }}</ref> The right to adequate palliative care has been affirmed by the US Supreme Court in two cases, ''[[Vacco v.

Doctors and nurses have an ethical obligation to ensure that when consent for pain treatment is withheld or given it is, whenever possible, withheld or given by a fully informed patient. Most importantly, patients must be apprised of any serious risks and the common side effects of pain treatments. What appears to be an obviously acceptable risk or harm to a professional may be unacceptable to the patient. For instance, patients who experience pain on movement may be willing to forgo strong opioids in order to enjoy alertness during their painless periods, whereas others would choose around-the-clock sedation so as to remain pain-free. Well-informed patients who communicate and work well with their medical providers are more likely to achieve an optimum pain management regimen. The care provider should not insist on treatment that the patient rejects, and must not provide treatment that the provider believes is more harmful or riskier than the possible benefits can justify.<ref name = Randall/>

Some patients – particularly those who are terminally ill – may not wish to be involved in making pain management decisions, and may delegate such choices to their treatment providers. The patient's participation is a right, not an obligation, and although reduced patient involvement may result in less-than-optimal pain management, their choice should be respected.<ref name = Randall/>

As medical professionals become better informed about the interdependent relationship between physical, emotional, social, and spiritual pain, and the demonstrated benefit to physical pain from alleviation of these other forms of suffering, they may be inclined to question the patient and family about interpersonal relationships. Unless the patient has asked for such psychosocial intervention – or at least freely consented to such questioning – this would be an ethically unjustifiable intrusion into the patient's personal affairs (analogous to providing drugs without the patient's informed consent).<ref name = Randall/>

The obligation of a professional medical care provider to alleviate suffering may occasionally come into conflict with the obligation to prolong life. If a terminally ill patient prefers to be painless, despite a high level of sedation and a risk of shortening their life, they should be provided with their desired pain relief (despite the cost of sedation and a possibly slightly shorter life). Where a patient is unable to be involved in this type of decision, the law and the medical profession in the United Kingdom allow the doctor to ''assume'' that the patient would prefer to be painless, and thus the provider may prescribe and administer adequate analgesia, even if the treatment may slightly hasten death. It is taken that the underlying cause of death in this case is the illness and not the necessary pain management.<ref name = Randall/>

One philosophical justification for the aforementioned legal approach is the [[doctrine of double effect]], where to justify an act involving both a good and a bad effect, four conditions are necessary: 

* the act must be good overall (or at least morally neutral)
* the person acting must intend only the good effect, with the bad effect considered an unwanted side effect
* the bad effect must not be the cause of the good effect
* the good effect must outweigh the bad effect.
