An '''acute assessment unit''', '''acute medical unit (AMU)''' or '''acute admissions unit (AAU)''' is a short-stay department in some [[hospital]]s that is sometimes part of the [[emergency department]], although a separate department. The AAU acts as a gateway between a patient's [[general practitioner]], the emergency department, and the wards of the hospital. The AAU helps the emergency department produce a healthy turnaround for patients, helping with the [[Four-hour target in emergency departments|four-hour waiting rule]]. An AAU is usually made up of several bays and has a small number of side-rooms and treatment rooms. They are fully equipped with emergency medical treatment facilities including [[defibrilator]]s and [[resuscitation]] equipment.

==Patients==
From the emergency department, patients can be moved to AAU where they will undergo further tests and stabilisation before they are transferred to the relevant ward or sent home. Also, patients can be admitted straight to AAU from their general practitioner if he or she believes the patient needs hospital treatment. A patient's stay in the unit is limited, usually no more than 48 hours.

The AAU deals with admissions only, patients will never be transferred from a ward to the AAU. Surgical Procedures are not carried out in the unit either; these are referred on to the relevant theatre such as cardiothoracics and general surgery.

==Staff==
Senior staff in an AAU include a [[consultant]] in [[internal medicine|general medicine]], [[emergency medicine]], or [[Critical care medicine|critical care]]. Often a [[Specialist registrar|registrar]] in general medicine, and a [[Nurse#Nursing titles|ward sister]] or a [[Nurse#Nursing titles|charge nurse]] have roles in the unit. A number of [[nurse|staff nurses]] work alongside the senior staff to provide care to patients in the unit.

Although AAU has its own staff trained to deal with patients and provide care, members of staff from other departments in the hospital are needed in AAU to assess patients and provide further diagnosis. Typical examples of staff who may be needed in AAU are [[general surgeon]]s, [[Cardiothoracic surgery|cardiothoracic surgeons]], [[cardiologists]], and a [[Psychiatry|psychiatric liaison nurse]].

==Alternative names for the department==

In hospitals with Clinical Decisions Units, it is often referred to colloquially as the "can't decide unit", due to the fact that they can be overcrowded easily if [[Emergency Department|Accident and Emergency]] is full.

The department can also include pharmacists, who carry out duties such as medical history taking.
