'''Antibiotic resistance''' is a form of [[drug resistance]] whereby some (or, less commonly, all) sub-populations of a [[microorganism]], usually a [[bacteria]]l species, are able to survive after exposure to one or more [[antibiotic]]s; pathogens resistant to multiple antibiotics are considered ''[[multidrug resistant]]'' (MDR) or, more colloquially, superbugs. People do not develop resistance to antibiotics.<ref name=cdcgetsmart>{{cite web|title=Antibiotic Resistance Questions & Answers|url=http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html#e|work=Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA|accessdate=20 March 2013|date=30|month=June|year=2009}}</ref>

Antibiotic resistance is a serious and growing phenomenon in contemporary medicine and has emerged as one of the eminent public health concerns of the 21st century, particularly as it pertains to pathogenic organisms (the term is not especially relevant to organisms which don't cause disease in humans). In the simplest cases, drug-resistant organisms may have acquired resistance to first-line antibiotics, thereby necessitating the use of second-line agents. Typically, the first-line agent is selected on the basis of several advantages including safety, availability and cost; comparatively, the second-line agent is usually broader in spectrum, possesses a less favourable risk-benefit profile and may be more expensive or, in more dire circumstances, locally unavailable. In the case of some MDR pathogens, resistance to second and even third-line antibiotics is sequentially acquired, a case quintessentially illustrated by ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' in some [[nosocomial]] settings. Some pathogens, such as ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', additionally possess a high level of intrinsic resistance.

It may take the form of a spontaneous or induced genetic mutation, or the acquisition of resistance [[gene]]s from other bacterial species by [[horizontal gene transfer]] via [[bacterial conjugation|conjugation]], [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]], or [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]]. Many antibiotic resistance genes reside on transmissible [[plasmids]], facilitating their transfer. Exposure to an antibiotic [[natural selection|naturally selects]] for the survival of the organisms with the genes for resistance. In this way, a gene for antibiotic resistance may readily spread through an ecosystem of bacteria. Antibiotic-resistance plasmids frequently contain genes conferring resistance to several different antibiotics. This is not the case for ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', the bacteria that causes [[Tuberculosis]], since evidence is lacking for whether these bacteria have plasmids.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2115217?dopt=Abstract |title=Does Mycobacterium tuberculosis have plasmids?

Genes for resistance to antibiotics, like the antibiotics themselves, are ancient.{{sfn|D'Costa|King|Kalan|Morar|2011|pp=457–461}} However, the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections seen in clinical practice stems from antibiotic use both within human medicine and [[veterinary medicine]]. Any use of antibiotics can increase [[selective pressure]] in a population of bacteria to allow the resistant bacteria to thrive and the susceptible bacteria to die off. As resistance towards antibiotics becomes more common, a greater need for alternative treatments arises. However, despite a push for new antibiotic therapies there has been a continued decline in the number of newly approved drugs.{{sfn|Donadio|Maffioli|Monciardini|Sosio|2010|pp=423–430}} Antibiotic resistance therefore poses a significant problem.

The growing prevalence and incidence of infections due to MDR pathogens is epitomised by the increasing number of familiar acronyms used to describe the causative agent and sometimes the infection generally; of these, [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] is probably the most well-known, but others including VISA (vancomycin-intermediate ''S. aureus''), VRSA (vancomycin-resistant ''S. aureus''), ESBL (Extended spectrum beta-lactamase), VRE (Vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus'') and MRAB (Multidrug-resistant ''A. baumannii'') are prominent examples. [[Nosocomial infection]]s overwhelmingly dominate cases where MDR pathogens are implicated, but multidrug-resistant infections are also becoming increasingly prevalent in the community.

Although there were low levels of preexisting antibiotic-resistant bacteria before the widespread use of antibiotics,{{sfn|Caldwell|Lindberg|2011}} {{sfn|Nelson|2009|p=294}} evolutionary pressure from their use has played a role in the development of muiltidrug resistance varieties and the spread of resistance between bacterial species.{{sfn|Hawkey|Jones|2009|pp=i3-i10}} In medicine, the major problem of the emergence of resistant bacteria is due to misuse and overuse of antibiotics.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040513120635/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs268/en/index.html|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs268/en/index.html |title=Use of antimicrobials outside human medicine and resultant antimicrobial resistance in humans |author=WHO |authorlink=World Health Organisation |publisher=World Health Organization |archivedate=13 May 2004 |month=January |year=2002|ref=harv}}</ref> In some countries, antibiotics are sold over the counter without a prescription, which also leads to the creation of resistant strains.

Certain antibiotic classes are highly associated with colonisation with "superbugs" (highly antibiotic resistant bacteria) compared to other antibiotic classes. The risk for colonisation increases if there is a lack of sensitivity (resistance) of the superbugs to the antibiotic used and high tissue penetration, as well as broad-spectrum activity against "good bacteria".

Inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics has been attributed to a number of causes, including people who insist on antibiotics, physicians who simply prescribe them as they feel they do not have time to explain why they are not necessary, and physicians who do not know when to prescribe antibiotics or else are overly cautious for medical legal reasons.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Arnold |first=SR |last2=Straus |first2=SE |title=Interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices in ambulatory care |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=4 |pages=CD003539 |year=2005 |pmid=16235325 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003539.pub2 |editor1-last=Arnold |editor1-first=Sandra R|ref=harv}}</ref>  For example, a third of people believe that antibiotics are effective for the [[common cold]],<ref>{{cite journal |last=McNulty |first=CA |last2= Boyle |first2=P |last3= Nichols |first3=T |last4=Clappison |first4=P |last5=Davey |first5=P |title=The public's attitudes to and compliance with antibiotics |journal=[[J.

Antibiotic resistance has been shown to increase with duration of treatment; therefore, as long as a clinically effective lower limit is observed (that depends upon the organism and antibiotic in question), the use by the medical community of shorter courses of antibiotics is likely to decrease rates of resistance, reduce cost, and have better outcomes due to fewer complications such as [[c. difficile]] infection and diarrhea.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Li |first=JZ |last2= Winston |first2=LG |last3=Moore |first3=DH |last4= Bent |first4=S |title=Efficacy of short-course antibiotic regimens for community-acquired pneumonia: a meta-analysis |journal=Am.

Antibiotic-tolerant states may depend on physiological adaptations without direct connections to antibiotic target activity or to drug uptake, [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]], or inactivation. Identifying these adaptations, and targeting them to enhance the activity of existing drugs, is a promising approach to mitigate the public health crisis caused by the scarcity of new antibiotics.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The improper use of antibiotics and therapeutic treatments can often be attributed to the presence of structural violence in particular regions. Socioeconomic factors such as race and poverty affect the accessibility of and adherence to drug therapy. The efficacy of treatment programs for these drug-resistant strains depends on whether or not programmatic improvements take into account the effects of structural violence.<ref>Farmer, Paul E., Bruce Nizeye, Sara Stulac, and Salmaan Keshavjee. 2006. Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine. PLoS Medicine, 1686-1691.</ref>

===Role of other animals===
Drugs are used in animals that are used as human food, such as cattle, pigs, chickens, fish, etc. There has been extensive use of antibiotics in [[animal husbandry]]. Many of these drugs are not considered significant drugs for use in humans, either because of their lack of efficacy or purpose in humans, (such as the use of ionopores in ruminants<ref>{{cite web|last=Hersom|first=Matt|title=Application of Ionophores in Cattle Diets|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/AN/AN28500.pdf|work=AN285 Department of Animal Sciences|publisher=University of Florida IFAS Extension|accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref>) or because that drug has gone out of use in humans (such as the decline in use of [[sulfa drugs|Sulfonamide_(medicine)]] due to widespread allergic reactions and antibiotic resistance among human pathogens.) Historically, regulation of antibiotic use in food animals has been limited to limiting drug residues in meat, egg, and milk products, rather than concern over the development of antibiotic resistance.  This mirrors the primary concerns in human medicine, where researchers and doctors were historically more concerned about effective but non-toxic doses of drugs rather than antibiotic resistance. Evidence for the transfer of so-called superbugs from animals to humans has been scant, and most evidence shows that pathogens of concern in human populations originated in humans and are maintained there, with rare cases of transference to humans.  One of the pathogens most frequently cited in popular literature&nbsp;— MRSA&nbsp;— is largely maintained in the human population, often asyptomatically, and until recently has rarely been found in food or companion animals.<ref>{{cite web|last=American Veterinary Association|title=MRSA: Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus and Animals (FAQ)|url=https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/FAQs/Pages/MRSA-HHP-FAQs.aspx|accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref><ref>http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/Report/biohaz_report_301_joint_mrsa_en,0.pdf</ref>  More significantly, evidence for the transference of floroquinolone resistant genes in Camploybacteria strains through poultry was cited as justification for severely restricting veterinary use of floroquinolones in food animals in the USA.  (Use in companion animals is still permitted, and floroquinolones are the most commonly prescribed antibiotic to adult humans in the United States, despite guidelines which recommend it only be used in severe infections.)

The resistant bacteria in animals due to antibiotic exposure can be transmitted to humans via three pathways, those being through the consumption of meat, from close or direct contact with animals, or through the environment.<ref>{{cite web |last= Schneider |first=K |last2= Garrett |first2=L |title= Non-therapeutic Use of Antibiotics in Animal Agriculture, Corresponding Resistance Rates, and What Can be Done About It |url= http://www.cgdev.org/content/article/detail/1422307/ |publisher=Center for Global Development|date= June 19, 2009 |ref=harv}}</ref>/ However, complete cooking of meat inactivates bacteria, whether or not they are antibiotic-resistant. The World Health Organization concluded antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feeds should be prohibited, in the absence of risk assessments.

In 1998, European Union health ministers voted to ban four antibiotics widely used to promote animal growth (despite their scientific panel's recommendations). Regulation banning the use of antibiotics in European feed, with the exception of two antibiotics in poultry feeds, became effective in 2006.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Castanon |first=J.I. | year = 2007 | title = History of the use of antibiotic as growth promoters in European poultry feeds | journal = Poult.

Growing U.S. consumer concern about using antibiotics in animal feed has led to a niche market of "antibiotic-free" animal products, but this small market is unlikely to change entrenched, industry-wide practices.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Baker |first=R |title=Health management with reduced antibiotic use&nbsp;— the U.S. experience |journal=Anim.

In 2001, the Union of Concerned Scientists estimated that greater than 70% of the antibiotics used in the US are given to food animals (for example, chickens, pigs and cattle), in the absence of disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_environment/antibiotics_and_food/hogging-it-estimates-of-antimicrobial-abuse-in-livestock.html |title=Executive summary from the UCS report "Hogging It: Estimates of Antimicrobial Abuse in Livestock"|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|month= January |year=2001|ref=harv}}</ref> Hence, the amounts given are termed "sub-therapeutic", i.e., insufficient to combat disease—because no demonstrable disease is present.  Sub-therapeutic dosages kills some, but not all, of the bacterial organisms in the animal—leaving those that are naturally antibiotic-resistant.  Studies have shown, however, that the overall population levels of bacteria are essentially unchanged; only the mix of bacteria is affected.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Thus the actual mechanism by which sub-therapeutic antibiotic feed additives serve as growth promotors is unclear.  Some people have speculated that animals and fowl in feedlot environments may have sub-clinical infections, which are cured by low levels of antibiotics in feed, thereby allowing the creatures to thrive; but no convincing evidence has been advanced for this theory.  As the bacterial load in an animal is essentially unchanged by use of antibiotic feed additives, the mechanism of growth promotion is overwhelmingly likely to be something other than "killing off the bad bugs."

In 2000, the [[US Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) announced their intention to revoke approval of [[fluoroquinolone]] use in poultry production because of substantial evidence linking it to the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant ''[[Campylobacter]]'' infections in humans. The final decision to ban fluoroquinolones from use in poultry production was not made until five years later because of challenges from the food animal and pharmaceutical industries.<ref name="Nelson-2007">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Nelson | first1 = JM. | last2 = Chiller | first2 = TM. | last3 = Powers | first3 = JH. | last4 = Angulo | first4 = FJ. | title = Fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter species and the withdrawal of fluoroquinolones from use in poultry: a public health success story | journal = Clin Infect Dis | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 977–80 | month = Apr | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1086/512369 | pmid = 17342653 |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/512369 |format=PDF |ref=harv}}</ref>

During 2007, two federal bills (S. 549<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-549 |title=US Senate Bill S. 549: Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2007|ref=harv}}</ref> and H.R. 962<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-962 US House Bill H.R. 962: |title=Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2007|ref=harv}}</ref>) aimed at phasing out "nontherapeutic" antibiotics in US food animal production.  The Senate bill, introduced by Sen. Edward "Ted" Kennedy, died.  The House bill, introduced by Rep. Louise Slaughter, died after being referred to Committee.

====In the United States====
In the United States, evidence of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains due to wide use of antibiotics to promote weight gain in livestock was determined by the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] in 1977, but nothing effective was done to prevent the practice. In March, 2012 the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruling in an action brought by the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] and others, ordered the FDA to revoke approvals for the use of antibiotics in livestock which violated FDA regulations.<ref name=MPFDA>{{cite news|title=FDA Told to Move on Antibiotic Use in Livestock|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/FDAGeneral/31792|accessdate=March 24, 2012|newspaper=MedPage Today|date=March 23, 2012|author=John Gever}}</ref> On April 11, 2012 the FDA announced a voluntary program to phase out unsupervised use of drugs as feed additives and convert approved over-the-counter uses for antibiotics to prescription use only, requiring veterinarian supervision of their use and a prescription.<ref name=NYTPrescription>{{cite news|title=U.S. Tightens Rules on Antibiotics Use for Livestock|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/12/us/antibiotics-for-livestock-will-require-prescription-fda-says.html|accessdate=April 12, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 11, 2012|author=Gardiner Harris}}</ref><ref name=FDAFAQ>{{cite web|title=FDA's Strategy on Antimicrobial Resistance&nbsp;— Questions and Answers|url=http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/ucm216939.htm|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=April 12, 2012|date=April 11, 2012|quote=“Judicious use” is using an antimicrobial drug appropriately and only when necessary; Based on a thorough review of the available scientific information, FDA recommends that use of medically important antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals be limited to situations where the use of these drugs is necessary for ensuring animal health, and their use includes veterinary oversight or consultation.

[[File:mecA Resistance.svg|thumb|right|Diagram depicting antibiotic resistance through alteration of the antibiotic's target site, modeled after MRSA's resistance to penicillin. Beta-lactam antibiotics permanently inactivate [[Penicillin binding protein|PBP enzymes]], which are essential for bacterial life, by permanently binding to their active sites. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]], however, expresses a PBP that does not allow the antibiotic into its active site.]]
Antibiotic resistance can be a result of [[horizontal gene transfer]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ochiai|first= K.|last2= Yamanaka|first2= T |last3=Kimura |first3=K |last4=Sawada|first4= O |year=1959|title= Inheritance of drug resistance (and its transfer) between Shigella strains and Between Shigella and E.coli strains|journal= Hihon Iji Shimpor,|page= 1861|volume= 34|language= Japanese|ref=harv}}
</ref> and also of unlinked point mutations in the [[pathogen]] [[genome]] at a rate of about 1 in 10<sup>8</sup> per chromosomal replication. The antibiotic action against the pathogen can be seen as an environmental pressure. Those bacteria with a mutation that allows them to survive live to reproduce. They then pass this trait to their offspring, which leads to the evolution of a fully resistant colony.

The four main mechanisms by which microorganisms exhibit resistance to antimicrobials are:
# Drug inactivation or modification: for example, enzymatic deactivation of [[Penicillin|''penicillin'' G]] in some penicillin-resistant bacteria through the production of [[Beta-lactamases|β-lactamases]]
# Alteration of target site: for example, alteration of [[Penicillin binding protein|PBP]]—the binding target site of penicillins—in [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and other penicillin-resistant bacteria
# Alteration of metabolic pathway: for example, some [[sulfa drugs|sulfonamide]]-resistant bacteria do not require [[para-aminobenzoic acid]] (PABA), an important precursor for the synthesis of [[folic acid]] and [[nucleic acids]] in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides, instead, like mammalian cells, they turn to using preformed folic acid.
# Reduced drug accumulation: by decreasing drug [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] and/or increasing active [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] (pumping out) of the drugs across the cell surface<ref>{{cite journal |last=Li|first= X|last2=Nikadio |first2=H |title = Efflux-Mediated Drug Resistance in Bacteria: an Update| journal = Drug | volume = 69 | issue = 12 | pages = 1555–623| year = 2009 | pmid = 19678712 |  doi = 10.2165/11317030-000000000-00000|pmc= 2847397 |ref=harv}}</ref>

There are three known mechanisms of [[fluoroquinolone]] resistance. Some types of [[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] pumps can act to decrease intracellular [[quinolone]] concentration.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Morita |first=Y|last2=Kodama |first2=K |last3= Shiota |first3=S |last4=Mine |first4=T |last5= Kataoka |first5=A |last6= Mizushima |first6=T |last7= Tsuchiya |first7=T | title = NorM, a Putative Multidrug Efflux Protein, of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Its Homolog in Escherichia coli | journal = Antimicrob.

Antibiotic resistance can also be introduced artificially into a microorganism through laboratory protocols, sometimes used as a [[selectable marker]] to examine the mechanisms of gene transfer or to identify individuals that absorbed a piece of DNA that included the resistance gene and another gene of interest. A recent study demonstrated that the extent of [[horizontal gene transfer]] among ''Staphylococcus'' is much greater than previously expected—and encompasses genes with functions beyond antibiotic resistance and virulence, and beyond genes residing within the [[mobile genetic elements]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chan |first=CX |last2=Beiko |first2=RG |last3= Ragan |first3=MA |title=Lateral Transfer of Genes and Gene Fragments in Staphylococcus Extends beyond Mobile Elements |journal=J Bacteriol |volume=193 |issue=15 |pages=3964–3977 |year=2011 |month=August |pmid=21622749 |doi=10.1128/JB.01524-10 |pmc=3147504|ref=harv}}</ref>

For a long time it has been thought that for a microorganism to become resistant to an antibiotic, it must be in a large population. However, recent findings show that there is no necessity of large populations of bacteria for the appearance of antibiotic resistance. We know now, that small populations of E.coli in an antibiotic gradient can become resistant. Any heterogeneous environment with respect to nutrient and antibiotic gradients may facilitate the development of antibiotic resistance in small bacterial populations and this is also true for the human body. Researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of resistance development is based on four SNP mutations in the genome of E.coli produced by the gradient of antibiotic. These mutations confer the bacteria emergence of antibiotic resistance.

A common misconception is that a person can become resistant to certain antibiotics. It is a strain of microorganism that can become resistant, not a person's body.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html CDC: ''Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work'']</ref><ref>[http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/about_issue/societal_prob.shtml APUA: ''General Background: Antibiotic Resistance, A Societal Problem'']</ref>

==Resistant pathogens==

===''Staphylococcus aureus''===
{{Main|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus}}
''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (colloquially known as "Staph aureus" or a "Staph infection") is one of the major resistant pathogens. Found on the [[mucous membranes]] and the [[human skin]] of around a third of the population, it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure. It was one of the earlier bacteria in which [[penicillin]] resistance was found—in 1947, just four years after the drug started being mass-produced. [[Methicillin]] was then the antibiotic of choice, but has since been replaced by [[oxacillin]] due to significant kidney toxicity. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) was first detected in Britain in 1961, and is now "quite common" in hospitals. MRSA was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of [[sepsis]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1999, up from 4% in 1991. Half of all ''S. aureus'' infections in the [[United States|US]] are resistant to penicillin, methicillin, [[tetracycline]] and [[erythromycin]].

This left [[vancomycin]] as the only effective agent available at the time. However, strains with intermediate (4-8&nbsp;μg/ml) levels of resistance, termed glycopeptide-intermediate ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (GISA) or vancomycin-intermediate ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (VISA), began appearing in the late 1990s. The first identified case was in Japan in 1996, and strains have since been found in hospitals in England, France and the US. The first documented strain with complete (>16&nbsp;μg/ml) resistance to vancomycin, termed [[Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|vancomycin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (VRSA) appeared in the United States in 2002.<ref>{{Cite pmid|14563898}}</ref> However, in 2011 a variant of vancomycin has been tested that binds to the lactate variation and also binds well to the original target, thus reinstates potent antimicrobial activity.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja207142h |title=A Redesigned Vancomycin Engineered for Dual d-Ala-d-Ala and d-Ala-d-Lac Binding Exhibits Potent Antimicrobial Activity Against Vancomycin-Resistant Bacteria |author=Xie et al |journal=J.

A new class of antibiotics, [[Linezolid|oxazolidinones]], became available in the 1990s, and the first commercially available oxazolidinone, [[linezolid]], is comparable to vancomycin in effectiveness against MRSA. Linezolid-resistance in ''S. aureus'' was reported in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) has now emerged as an epidemic that is responsible for rapidly progressive, fatal diseases, including necrotizing pneumonia, severe [[sepsis]] and [[necrotizing fasciitis]].<ref name="pmid17146447">{{cite journal |last=Boyle-Vavra |first=S |last2= Daum |first2=RS |title=Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: the role of Panton-Valentine leukocidin |journal=Lab.

''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' (Group A ''Streptococcus'': GAS) infections can usually be treated with many different antibiotics. Early treatment may reduce the risk of death from invasive group A streptococcal disease. However, even the best medical care does not prevent death in every case. For those with very severe illness, supportive care in an intensive care unit may be needed.

Resistance of ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' to penicillin and other beta-lactams is increasing worldwide. The major mechanism of resistance involves the introduction of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. Selective pressure is thought to play an important role, and use of beta-lactam antibiotics has been implicated as a risk factor for infection and colonization.

===''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''===
''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' is a highly prevalent [[opportunistic pathogen]]. One of the most worrisome characteristics of ''P. aeruginosa'' is its low antibiotic susceptibility, which is attributable to a concerted action of [[efflux (microbiology)|multidrug efflux pumps]] with chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance genes (for example, ''mexAB-oprM'', ''mexXY'', etc.) and the low permeability of the bacterial cellular envelopes.<ref name="Poole2004">{{cite journal|last=Poole, |first=K. |year=2004|title= Efflux-mediated multiresistance in Gram-negative bacteria|journal= Clinical Microbiology and Infection |volume=10 |issue=1|pages= 12–26 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2004.00763.x |pmid=14706082|ref=harv}}</ref>  ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' has the ability to produce HAQs and it has been found that HAQs have prooxidant effects, and overexpressing modestly increased susceptibility to antibiotics.

===''Salmonella'' and ''E. coli''===
''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]'' come directly from contaminated food.  When both bacteria are spread, serious health conditions arise. Many people are hospitalized each year after becoming infected, with some dying as a result. By 1993, ''E. coli'' resistant to multiple [[quinolones|fluoroquinolone]] variants was documented.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===''Acinetobacter baumannii''===
On November 5, 2004, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reported an increasing number of ''[[Acinetobacter baumannii]]'' bloodstream infections in patients at military medical facilities in which service members injured in the [[Iraq]]/[[Kuwait]] region during [[Iraq war|Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and in [[Afghanistan]] during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] were treated. Most of these showed [[multidrug resistance]] (MRAB), with a few isolates resistant to all drugs tested.<ref name="pmid15549020">{{cite journal |title=Acinetobacter baumannii infections among patients at military medical facilities treating injured U.S. service members, 2002-2004 |journal=MMWR Morb.

===''Mycobacterium tuberculosis''===
[[Tuberculosis]] is increasing across the globe, especially in developing countries, over the past few years. TB resistant to antibiotics is called [[Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis|MDR TB]] (Multidrug Resistant TB). The rise of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has contributed to this.<ref name="journals.lww.com">{{cite web|url=http://journals.lww.com/co-infectiousdiseases/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2009&issue=04000&article=00014&type=abstract |title=Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis : Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases |doi=10.1097/QCO.0b013e3283229fab |publisher=Journals.lww.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>

TB was considered one of the most prevalent diseases, and did not have a cure until the discovery of [[Streptomycin]] by [[Selman Waksman]] in 1943.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/29220 |title=History of Tuberculosis&nbsp;— Karger Publishers |publisher=Karger.com |date=1998-02-20 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref> However, the bacteria soon developed resistance. Since then, drugs such as [[isoniazid]] and [[rifampin]] have been used. M. tuberculosis develops resistance to drugs by spontaneous mutations in its genomes. Resistance to one drug is common, and this is why treatment is usually done with more than one drug. [[Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis|Extensively Drug Resistant TB]] (XDR TB) is TB that is also resistant to the second line of drugs.<ref name="journals.lww.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1740676510000271 |title=Drug Discovery Today: Disease Mechanisms&nbsp;— Transmission of MDR tuberculosis |publisher=ScienceDirect.com |date=2010-10-06 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>

Resistance of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' to [[isoniazid]], [[rifampin]], and other common treatments has become an increasingly relevant clinical challenge. (For more on Drug Resistant TB, visit the [[Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis]] page.)

==Alternatives==

===Prevention===
Rational use of [[antibiotics]] may reduce the chances of development of opportunistic infection by antibiotic-resistant bacteria due to [[dysbacteriosis]]. In one study, the use of fluoroquinolones is clearly associated with ''[[Clostridium difficile]]'' infection, which is a leading cause of [[nosocomial]] [[diarrhea]] in the United States,<ref name="pmid12781017">{{cite journal |last=McCusker |first=ME|last2= Harris |first2=AD|last3= Perencevich |first3=E|last4= Roghmann |first4=MC |title=Fluoroquinolone Use and Clostridium difficile–Associated Diarrhea |journal=Emerging Infect.

[[Vaccine]]s do not have the problem of resistance because a vaccine enhances the body's natural defenses, while an antibiotic operates separately from the body's normal defenses. Nevertheless, new strains may [[Evolution|evolve]] that escape immunity induced by vaccines; for example an updated [[influenza vaccine]] is needed each year.

While theoretically promising, antistaphylococcal vaccines have shown limited efficacy, because of immunological variation between ''Staphylococcus'' species, and the limited duration of effectiveness of the antibodies produced. Development and testing of more effective vaccines is under way.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization ([[CSIRO]]), realizing the need for the reduction of antibiotic use, has been working on two alternatives. One alternative is to prevent diseases by adding [[cytokine]]s instead of antibiotics to animal feed. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} These proteins are made in the animal body "naturally" after a disease and are not antibiotics, so they do not contribute to the antibiotic resistance problem. Furthermore, studies on using cytokines have shown they also enhance the growth of animals like the antibiotics now used, but without the drawbacks of nontherapeutic antibiotic use. Cytokines have the potential to achieve the animal growth rates traditionally sought by the use of antibiotics without the contribution of antibiotic resistance associated with the widespread nontherapeutic uses of antibiotics currently used in the food animal production industries. Additionally, CSIRO is working on vaccines for diseases.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Phage therapy===
[[Phage therapy]], an approach that has been extensively researched and used as a therapeutic agent for over 60 years, especially in the [[Soviet Union]], represents a potentially significant but currently underdeveloped approach to the treatment of bacterial disease.<ref>{{cite doi|10.3389/fmicb.2012.00238}}</ref> Phage therapy was widely used in the United States until the discovery of antibiotics, in the early 1940s. Bacteriophages or "phages" are viruses that invade bacterial cells and, in the case of lytic phages, disrupt bacterial metabolism and cause the bacterium to [[lysis|lyse]]. Phage therapy is the therapeutic use of lytic [[bacteriophages]] to treat [[pathogenic]] bacterial infections.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Phages and their application against drug-resistant bacteria| journal=J.

Bacteriophage therapy is an important alternative to antibiotics in the current era of multidrug resistant pathogens. A review of studies that dealt with the therapeutic use of phages from 1966–1996 and few latest ongoing phage therapy projects via internet showed: phages were used topically, orally or systemically in Polish and Soviet studies. The success rate found in these studies was 80–95% with few gastrointestinal or allergic side effects. British studies also demonstrated significant efficacy of phages against ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Acinetobacter]]'' spp., ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' spp. and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''. US studies dealt with improving the bioavailability of phage. Phage therapy may prove as an important alternative to antibiotics for treating multidrug resistant pathogens.<ref>{{cite journal | title= Bacteriophage therapy: an alternative to conventional antibiotics | last=Mathur |first=MD|last2= Vidhani |first2=S |last3= Mehndiratta|first3= PL| journal=J Assoc Physicians India | year=2003 | volume=51 | pages=593–6 | doi= 10.1258/095646202760159701 | pmid= 12194741 | issue= 8 |ref=harv | last4= Bhalla | first4= P | last5= Reddy | first5= B S N}}</ref>

==Research==

===New medications===

Until recently, [[research and development]] (R&D) efforts have provided new drugs in time to treat bacteria that became resistant to older antibiotics. However: "The supply of new replacement antimicrobial agents has slowed dramatically and we face the prospect of a future where
we have far fewer options in the treatment of infectious disease"<ref>https://www.wp.dh.gov.uk/publications/files/2013/03/CMO-Annual-Report-Volume-2-20111.pdf</ref>  The potential crisis at hand is the result of a marked decrease in industry R&D, and the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria. Infectious disease physicians are alarmed by the prospect that effective antibiotics may not be available to treat seriously ill patients in the near future.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|last=Walsh |first=Fergus |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21737844 |title=BBC News&nbsp;— Antibiotics resistance 'as big a risk as terrorism' - medical chief |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>  Poor financial investment in antibiotic research has exacerbated the situation<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

In research published on October 17, 2008 in ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]]'', a team of scientists pinpointed the place on bacteria where the antibiotic [[myxopyronin]] launches its attack, and why that attack is successful. The myxopyronin binds to and inhibits the crucial bacterial enzyme, [[RNA polymerase]]. The myxopyronin changes the structure of the switch-2 segment of the enzyme, inhibiting its function of reading and transmitting DNA code. This prevents RNA polymerase from delivering genetic information to the [[ribosomes]], causing the bacteria to die.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mukhopadhyay, J.; Das, K.; Ismail, S.; Koppstein, D.; Jang, M.; Hudson, B.; Sarafianos, S.; Tuske, S.; Patel, J., Jansen, R., Irschik, H., Arnold, E., [[Richard H.

In 2012, a team of the University of Leipzig modified a peptide found in honeybees. It is effective against 37 types of bacteria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/90/web/2012/05/Modified-Bee-Peptide-Slays-Deadly.html |title=Modified Bee Peptide Slays Deadly Bacteria &#124; Chemical & Engineering News |publisher=Cen.acs.org |date=2012-05-29 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>

One major cause of antibiotic resistance is the increased pumping activity of microbial [[ABC transporters]], which diminishes the effective drug concentration inside the microbial cell. ABC transporter inhibitors that can be used in combination with current antimicrobials are being tested in clinical trials and are available for therapeutic regimens.<ref name= Ponte-SucreA>{{cite book |author= Ponte-Sucre, A (editor)| year=2009 |title=ABC Transporters in Microorganisms | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-49-3}}</ref>

===Applications===
Antibiotic resistance is an important tool for [[genetic engineering]]. By constructing a [[plasmid]] that contains an antibiotic resistance gene as well as the gene being engineered or expressed, a researcher can ensure that when bacteria replicate, only the copies that carry the plasmid survive. This ensures that the gene being manipulated passes along when the bacteria replicates.

The most commonly used antibiotics in genetic engineering are generally "older" antibiotics that have largely fallen out of use in clinical practice. These include:
* [[ampicillin]]
* [[kanamycin]]
* [[tetracycline]]
* [[chloramphenicol]]

Industrially the use of antibiotic resistance is disfavored since maintaining bacterial cultures would require feeding them large quantities of antibiotics. Instead, the use of [[auxotrophic]] bacterial strains (and function-replacement plasmids) is preferred.
