A '''leiomyoma''' (plural is 'leiomyomata') is a [[benign]] [[smooth muscle]] [[neoplasm]] that is very rarely (0.1%) [[premalignant]]. They can occur in any organ, but the most common forms occur in the [[uterus]], [[small bowel]] and the [[esophagus]].

== Etymology==
* Greek:
** λεῖος ''leios'' "[[:wikt:smooth|smooth]]"
** μῦς ''mus'' (''cf''. myo-) "[[mouse]] or [[muscle]]"
** -ωμα -''oma'' "[[tumor]]"
* Latin:
** ''fibra'' "[[fiber]]"

==Uterine leiomyomata==
{{main|Uterine fibroids}}
Uterine fibroids are leiomyomata of the [[uterus|uterine]] smooth muscle. As other leiomyomata, they are [[benign]], but may lead to excessive menstrual bleeding ([[menorrhagia]]), often cause [[anemia]] and may lead to [[infertility]].

A rare form of these tumors is uterine [[lipoleiomyoma]] - benign tumors consisting of a mixture of [[adipocytes]] and smooth muscle cells. Uterine lipoleiomyomata have been observed together with ovarian and other pathologies and some of them may develop into [[liposarcoma]].<ref>{{cite pmid|10612811}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|21263242}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal

==Esophageal==
They are also the most common [[benign]] [[esophageal]] [[tumour]], though this accounts for less than 1% of esophageal neoplasms. The remainder consists mainly of carcinomas. Although the vast majority of benign esophageal tumors are clinically silent and go undetected, large or strategically located tumors may become symptomatic.<ref name=AMN>{{cite web | author = James C.

==Cutaneous==
Leiomyomas of the skin are generally (1) acquired, and (2) divided into several categories:<ref name="Fitz2">{{cite book |author=Freedberg, Irwin M.; Fitzpatrick, Thomas B. |title=Fitzpatrick's dermatology in general medicine |publisher=McGraw-Hill, Medical Pub.

==Leiomyoma of jejunum==
Leiomyoma is the most common benign tumor of small bowel. Approximately 50% of cases are found in the jejunum, followed by the ileum in 31% of cases. Almost one half of all lesions are less than 5 centimeters.<ref name=ARO>{{cite web | author = By Michael P.

==Other locations, metastatic leiomyoma==
* metastatic leiomyoma are an extremely rare complication after [[hysterectomy]] for uterine fibroids. Most frequent sites of occurrence are the lungs and pelvis, the lesions are hormonally responsive.<ref name=Patton_2006>{{cite pmid|16357844}}</ref><ref name=Beck_2012>{{cite pmid|22477740}}</ref><ref name=Rivera_2004>{{cite pmid|15240591}}</ref>
* fibromyoma of the breast is an extremely rare benign breast neoplasm. Most reports in literature mention a history of hysterectomy for uterine fibroids, although the question whether these fibromyomas are possibly metastases of the uterine fibroids has not been investigated. An alternative hypothesis is an origin from the smooth muscle of the nipple.
