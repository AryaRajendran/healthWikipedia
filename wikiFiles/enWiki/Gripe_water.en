== History ==
Various remedies to help infants sleep during restlessness and to combat minor upset stomachs in babies have been around for centuries in different cultures, but the first "gripe water" was formulated in England in 1851 and used by English nannies.  Gripe water was discovered accidentally by William Woodward, an English pharmacist who did his apprenticeship in Boston, Linconshire, and later bought a business in Nottingham<ref name=story/> and quickly became adopted as a prescription by physicians.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Onwhyn |first=J |url=http://books.google.com/?id=KQICAAAAYAAJ&dq= | title=Notes, Short Comments, and Answers to Correspondents | journal=The Lancet | volume=1 | issue=Part 1 | date=January - April, 1898 | pages=414}}</ref> In the 1840s babies in Eastern England were afflicted by a condition known as "[[fen fever]]", and during that time there was also an outbreak of [[malaria]] in England.<ref>{{cite book | last=Jain |first=K |year=2007 |title=Gods in the Bazaar: The Economies of Indian Calendar Art |publisher=Duke University Press |pages=121 | isbn=0-8223-8973-8}}</ref> Woodward took his inspiration from the manner in which malaria as well as "fen fever" was being treated and noted that the formula used to treat fen fever was also an effective "soother of fretful babies and provided relief from gastrointestinal troubles in infants."  The original Woodward's Gripe Water contained 3.6% alcohol, dill oil, sodium bicarbonate, sugar, and water. Woodward registered "Gripe Water" as a [[trademark]] in 1876.<ref>{{cite journal | year=1914 | journal=Chemist and Druggist | volume=84 | pages=152–154}}</ref> It was initially marketed with the slogan "Granny told Mother and Mother told me." 

In 1993, the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] ordered an automatic detention of all shipments of Woodward's into the U.S. on the basis of its being an unapproved drug.<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_190.html FDA Import Alert # 66-41]</ref> In response of the FDA's import alert, Woodward's and other manufacturers have continued marketing the products, but as a dietary supplement.<ref name=story />

== Usage ==
The original formulation now varies slightly according to the country of manufacture. In many countries including the US, alcohol and sucrose have been replaced with other ingredients. However, [[sodium bicarbonate]] continues to be the primary active ingredient,<ref>List of ingredients - Life Brand Gripe Water</ref> along with the mainstays of [[dill]] and [[fennel]] oils. While evidence of gripe water's effectiveness has been limited to anecdotal accounts, there has been speculation about the reasons for the effectiveness of gripe water. Its commercial success has led to many imitations, including some of which that have strayed substantially from the original formulation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Zimmerman|first=DR |year=1992 |title=Zimmerman's Complete Guide to Nonprescription Drugs |publisher=Visible Ink Press | isbn=0-8103-8874-X}}</ref>

Gripe water is recommended by some pediatricians and alternative practitioners as a [[naturopathic]] treatment option.<ref>{{cite book | author=Lauren Feder, MD |year=2005 |title=Natural Baby and Childcare |publisher=Hatherleigh |pages=432}}</ref> It is available in the United States as an over-the-counter supplement rather  than a medicine  regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration]], as well as in various dietary supplement forms. Gripe water continues to be a very popular remedy for colic and other minor [[gastrointestinal]] upsets including [[flatulence]]. Many people now consider it to be a viable and preferable alternative to common medications.<ref name="lester">{{cite book | last=Lester |first=BM |coauthors=O'Neill, G |year=2005 |title=Why Is My Baby Crying?
