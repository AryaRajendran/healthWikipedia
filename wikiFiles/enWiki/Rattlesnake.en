'''Rattlesnakes''' are a group of [[venomous snakes]] of the [[genera]] ''[[Crotalus]]'' and ''[[Sistrurus]]''<ref name="price-38-39">{{cite book|author=Price, Andrew H.|title=Venomous Snakes of Texas: A Field Guide|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-292-71967-5|pages=38–39|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F4IQO5Jo2t8C&pg=PA38}}</ref> of the subfamily ''[[Crotalinae]]'' ("pit vipers"). There are 32 known [[List of rattlesnake species and subspecies|species of rattlesnake]], with between 65-70 subspecies,<ref name="Barceloux-1026">Barceloux, 2008: [http://books.google.com/books?id=CpqzhHc072AC&pg=PA1026 p. 1026]</ref> all native to the [[Americas]], ranging from southern [[Alberta]] and southern [[British Columbia]] in [[Canada]] to Central [[Argentina]].

Rattlesnakes are [[predator]]s who live in a wide array of habitats, hunting small animals such as [[birds]] and [[rodents]]. They kill their prey with a venomous bite, rather than by [[Constriction|constricting]]. All rattlesnakes possess a set of [[fangs]] with which they inject large quantities of [[hemotoxic]] venom. The venom travels through the bloodstream, destroying [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] and causing swelling, internal bleeding, and intense pain. Some species, such as the [[Mojave Rattlesnake]], additionally possess a [[neurotoxic]] component in their venom that causes [[paralysis]] and other [[nervous system|nervous]] symptoms.

The threat of envenomation, advertised by the loud shaking of the titular noisemaker ("rattle") at the end of their tail, deters many predators. However, rattlesnakes fall prey to [[hawks]], [[weasels]], [[king snakes]], and a variety of other species. Rattlesnakes are heavily preyed upon as neonates, while they are still weak and mentally immature. Very large numbers of rattlesnakes are killed by humans. Rattlesnake populations in many areas are severely [[threatened species|threatened]] by [[habitat destruction]], [[poaching]], and extermination campaigns.

Rattlesnake bites are the leading cause of [[snakebite]] injuries in [[North America]]. However, rattlesnakes rarely bite unless provoked or threatened; and if treated promptly, the bites are rarely fatal.

==Names==
Rattlesnakes receive their name from the [[Rattlesnake#Rattle|rattle]] located at the end of their tails, which, when shaken, makes a loud rattling noise that deters predators or serves as a warning to passersby.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.whmentors.org/saf/snakes.html|title=RATTLESNAKE! |author=Willis Lamm }}</ref> The scientific name ''Crotalus'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]], ''κρόταλον'', meaning "[[castanet]]".<ref>{{cite book|editors=Kini, R. Manjunatha et al.|title=Toxins and Hemostasis|publisher=Springer 2011|year=2011|isbn=978-90-481-9294-6|page=99|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tfPSflF8GSkC&pg=PA99}}</ref> The name ''Sistrurus'' is the [[Latin language|Latinized]] form of the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "tail rattler" (''Σείστρουρος, Seistrouros'') and shares its root with the ancient [[Egypt]]ian musical instrument, the [[sistrum]], a type of rattle.<ref>{{cite book|author=Fox, William Sherwood|title=The Bruce beckons: the story of Lake Huron's great peninsula|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year=1988|isbn=978-0-8020-6007-5|page=122|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VmYIbxqPOLYC&pg=PA122}}</ref>

==Ecology==

===Range and habitat===
[[File:Crotalus atrox (2).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Western diamondback rattlesnake (''[[Crotalus atrox]]''), responsible for the majority of venomous snakebites in North America, coiled in defensive posture with rattle erect]]
Rattlesnakes are native to the [[Americas]], living in diverse habitats from Southwestern [[Canada]] to Central [[Argentina]]. The large majority of species live in the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]] and [[Mexico]]. Four species may be found east of the [[Mississippi river]], and two in [[South America]]. In the [[United States]], the states with the most types of rattlesnakes are [[Texas]] and [[Arizona]].

Rattlesnakes are found in almost every type of habitat that is capable of supporting terrestrial [[ectothermic]] [[vertebrates]]; but individual species can have extremely specific habitat requirements, only able to live within certain [[plant associations]] in a narrow range of altitudes. Most species live near open, rocky areas. Rocks offer them cover from predators, plentiful prey (e.g. rodents, lizards, insects, etc. that live amidst the rocks), and open basking areas. However, rattlesnakes can also be found in a wide variety of other habitats including [[prairies]], [[marshes]], [[deserts]], and [[forests]].<ref>Rubio, 1998: p. 24</ref> Rattlesnakes prefer a temperature range between 80 and 90°F (26-32°C), but can survive temperatures below [[freezing]], recovering from brief exposure to temperatures as low as 4°F (-16°C), and surviving for several days in temperatures as low as 37°F (3°C).<ref>Rubio, 1998: p. 71</ref>

Evidence has been collected to show the most probable ancestral area of rattlesnakes is the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] region in Mexico. This same study found the most probable vegetation or habitat of the ancestral area to be pine-oak forests.<ref name="Place">{{cite journal | author=Place, Arron J; Abramson, Charles I. | title=A Quantitative Analysis of the Ancestral Area of Rattlesnakes  | journal=Journal of Herpetology  |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=151–156 |year=2004}}</ref>

===Prey===
Rattlesnakes consume mice, rats, small birds and other small animals,<ref>Klauber, 1997: [http://books.google.com/books?id=mpTKB1P5VEYC&pg=PA612 p. 612]</ref> playing an important ecological role by limiting the size of rodent populations, which prevents crop damage and stabilizes ecosystems.<ref>Rubio, 1998: pp. 161, 163</ref>

Rattlesnakes lie in wait for their [[prey]], or hunt for it in holes.<ref>Klauber, 1997: [http://books.google.com/books?id=W8Tz8QaJ2HoC&pg=PA387 p. 387]</ref> The prey are killed quickly with a [[venom]]ous bite as opposed to [[constriction|constricting]]. If the bitten prey moves away before dying, the rattlesnake can follow it by its scent.<ref>Klauber, 1997: [http://books.google.com/books?id=W8Tz8QaJ2HoC&pg=PA834 p. 834]</ref><ref>{{cite book|chapter=Rattlesnakes can use airborne cues during post-strike prey relocation|editors=Mason, Robert T. et al.|title=Chemical signals in vertebrates 10|publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=978-0-387-25159-2|page=397|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zBZZNiN9_PoC&pg=PA397|author=Parker, M. Rockwell & Kardong, Kenneth V.}}</ref> When it locates the fallen prey, it checks for signs of life by prodding with its snout, flicking its tongue, and using its sense of smell. Once the prey has become incapacitated, the rattlesnake locates its head by odors emitted from the mouth. The prey is then ingested head-first, which allows wings and limbs to fold at the joints in a manner which minimizes the girth of the meal.<ref name="Rubio-81">Rubio, 1998: p. 81</ref> The gastric fluids of rattlesnakes are extremely powerful, allowing for the digestion of bone as well as flesh. Optimal digestion occurs when the snake maintains a body temperature of between 80 and 85°F (25-29°C). If the prey is small, the rattlesnake will often continue hunting. If it was an adequate meal, the snake will find a warm, safe location in which to coil up and rest until the prey is digested.<ref>Rubio, 1998: p. 83</ref>

Rattlesnakes are believed to require at least their own body weight in water annually in order to remain hydrated. The method in which they drink depends on the water source. In larger bodies of water (streams, ponds, etc.) they will submerge their head and ingest water by opening and closing their jaw, which sucks in water. If drinking dew, or drinking from small puddles, they will sip the liquid either by capillary action or by flattening and flooding the lower jaw.<ref>Rubio, 1998: p. 87</ref>

===Predators===
Newborn rattlesnakes are heavily preyed upon by a variety of species including [[raven]]s, [[crows]], [[roadrunners]], [[raccoon]]s, [[opossums]], [[skunks]], [[coyotes]] and [[weasels]], [[whipsnakes]], [[kingsnakes]], and [[Coluber|racers]]. Neonates of the smaller Crotaline species are frequently killed and eaten by small predatory birds such as [[jays]], [[kingfishers]], and [[shrikes]]. Some species of [[ants]] in the genus ''[[Formica]]'' are known to prey upon neonates, and it is very likely that ''[[Solenopsis invicta]]'' (fire ants) do as well. On occasion, hungry adult rattlesnakes will [[cannibalize]] neonates. The small proportion (often as few as 20%) of rattlesnakes that make it to their second year are heavily preyed upon by a variety of larger predators including coyotes, [[eagle]]s, [[hawks]], [[owls]], [[feral pigs]], [[badgers]], [[indigo snakes]], and [[kingsnake]]s.<ref name="Rubio-120" />

The common [[kingsnake]] (''[[Lampropeltis getula]]''), a [[constriction|constrictor]], is [[immune]] to the venom of rattlesnakes and other [[Viperidae|viper]]s, and rattlesnakes form part of its natural diet. Rattlesnakes sense kingsnakes' presence by their odor.<ref>Rubio, 1998: p. 59 -- Knowledge that rattlesnakes are so afraid of kingsnakes' odor led to the development of effective synthetic rattlesnake repellents.</ref> When they realize a kingsnake is nearby, they begin enacting a set of defensive postures known as "body bridging". Unlike its normal erect and coiled defensive-striking posture, the rattlesnake keeps its head low to the ground in an attempt to prevent the kingsnake from gaining a hold of it (the head being the first part of the rattlesnake that is ingested). The rattlesnake jerks its body about, while bridging its back upwards, forming an elevated coil which faces the kingsnake. The elevated coil is used to strike the attacker, and is also used to shield the head from the kingsnake.<ref>Rubio, 1998: p. 59 -- This behavior is believed to be unique to crotaline species.</ref>

==Anatomy==

===Sensory organs===
[[File:Crotalus horridus (1).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Timber rattlesnake (''[[Crotalus horridus]]'') with clearly visible facial pits]]
Like all [[pit vipers]], rattlesnakes have two organs that can sense [[radiation]]: their eyes, and a set of heat-sensing "pits" on their face that enable them to locate prey and move towards it, based on the prey's [[thermal radiation]] signature. These pits have a relatively short effective range of approximately 1&nbsp;ft, but nevertheless give the rattlesnake a distinctive advantage in hunting for warm-blooded creatures at night.<ref>Klauber, 1997: [http://books.google.com/books?id=mpTKB1P5VEYC&pg=PA401 pp.401-402]</ref><ref>Furman, 2007: [http://books.google.com/books?id=S5bM83jWl9YC&pg=PA8 p. 8]</ref>

Rattlesnake [[eyes]], which contain a large number of [[rod cells]], are well adapted to nocturnal use.<ref name="Rubio-67" /><ref name="Klauber-384-389" /> However rattlesnakes are not exclusively nocturnal, and their [[visual system|vision]] is more acute during daylight conditions.<ref name="Klauber-384-389" /> Rattlesnakes also possess [[cone cells]], which means that they are capable of some form of color vision. The rattlesnake eye lacks a [[fovea]] making it impossible for them to see sharply defined images. Instead, they mostly rely on the perception of movement.<ref name="Rubio-67">Rubio, 1998: p. 67</ref> Rattlesnake eyes are capable of horizontal rotation, but they do not appear to move their eyeballs to follow moving objects.<ref name="Klauber-384-389">Klauber, 1997: [http://books.google.com/books?id=W8Tz8QaJ2HoC&pg=PA384 pp. 384-389]</ref>

Rattlesnakes have an exceptionally keen sense of [[Olfaction|smell]]. They can sense olfactory stimuli both through their [[nostrils]], and by flicking their [[tongue]], which carries scent-bearing particles to the [[Jacobson's organ]] in the roof of their mouth.<ref>Furman, 2007: [http://books.google.com/books?id=S5bM83jWl9YC&pg=PA9 p. 9]</ref><ref name="cetaruk-1075" />

Like all snakes, rattlesnakes do not have external [[ear]] openings, and the structures of their [[middle ear]] is not as highly specialized as those of other vertebrates, such as mammals. Thus their sense of [[sound]] is not very effective. However, they are capable of sensing [[vibrations]] in the ground, passed via the skeleton to the [[auditory nerve]].<ref name="Rubio-67" />

===Fangs===
[[File:Crotalus skull.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Rattlesnake skull]]

Rattlesnake fangs are connected by venom ducts to large poison glands near the outer edge of the upper jaw, towards the rear of the head. When the rattlesnake bites, muscles on the sides of the venom glands contract, which squeezes the venom through the ducts and into the fangs. When the fangs are not in use, they remain folded against the palate.<ref>{{cite book|author=Vitts, Laurie J.|chapter=Rattlesnake|editors=Mares, Michael A. et al.|title=Encyclopedia of deserts|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8061-3146-7|page=468|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=g3CbqZtaF4oC&pg=PA468}}</ref><ref>Klauber, 1997: [http://books.google.com/books?id=W8Tz8QaJ2HoC&pg=PA773 p. 773]</ref>

Rattlesnakes are born with fully functioning fangs and venom, and are capable of killing prey at birth.<ref name="Rubio-120">Rubio, 1998: p. 120</ref><ref>See also Klauber, 1997: [http://books.google.com/books?id=W8Tz8QaJ2HoC&pg=PA829 p. 829]</ref> Adult rattlesnakes shed their fangs every 6–10 weeks. At least 3 pairs of replacement fangs lie behind the functional pair.<ref name="Barceloux-1028">Barceloux, 2008: [http://books.google.com/books?id=CpqzhHc072AC&pg=PA1028 p. 1028]</ref>

===Venom===
Most species of rattlesnakes can control how much venom to inject and have [[hemotoxin|hemotoxic]] venom, destroying tissue, causing [[necrosis]] and [[coagulopathy]] (disrupted blood clotting).<ref name="schoenherr-510">{{cite book|author=Schoenherr, Allan A.|title=A Natural History of California|publisher=University of California Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-520-06922-0|page=510|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SY3Kfe3FmVsC&pg=PA510}}</ref> In the U.S., some varieties of the [[Mojave rattlesnake]] (''C. scutulatus'') also have a [[presynaptic]] neurotoxic venom component known as Mojave Type A toxin, which can cause severe [[paralysis]].<ref name="schoenherr-510" /><ref>{{cite book|editor=Lessenger, James E.|title=Agricultural medicine: a practical guide|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=2006|isbn=978-0-387-25425-8|page=447|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oWWiF6ornEYC&pg=PA447}}</ref><ref name="luch-267" />  ''C. scutulatus'' is widely regarded as producing one of the most toxic snake venoms in the Americas, based on {{LD50}} studies in laboratory mice.<ref name="Glenn1">Glenn, J.L., R.C.Straight. 1982. The rattlesnakes and their venom yield and lethal toxicity. In: Tu, A. (ed) ''Rattlesnake Venoms, Their Actions and Treatment''. New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc.</ref>

Rattlesnake venom is a mixture of 5-15 enzymes, various metal ions, biogenic amines, lipids, free amino acids, proteins, and polypeptides. It contains components designed to immobilize and disable the prey, as well as digestive enzymes which break down tissue to prepare for later ingestion.<ref name="cetaruk-1075" /><ref name="Barceloux-1028" /> The venom is very stable, and retains its toxicity for many years in storage.<ref name="cetaruk-1075" />

Older snakes possess more potent venom, and larger snakes are frequently capable of storing larger volumes of it.<ref name="Gupta-800-801" />

===Rattle===
[[File:Rattlesnake rattles.jpg|right|thumb|Rattlesnake rattle]]
[[File:Britannica Rattlesnake Rattle.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing of the rattle]]
<div style="float: left>{{Listen|filename=Rattlesnake.ogg|title=Rattlesnake|description=The characteristic sound of a rattlesnake -- the rattle shaking, as a result of extremely rapid tail movement.|pos=left|format=[[Ogg]]}}</div>

According to Rubio, "The most widely accepted hypothesis for the evolution of the rattle is that the rattle is a warning device for predatory animals that might be a threat to the rattlesnake. It produces a signal to drive them away."<ref>Rubio, 1998: p. 56</ref>

The rattle is composed of a series of hollow, interlocked segments made of [[keratin]], which are created by modifying the scales that cover the tip of the tail. The contraction of special "shaker" muscles in the tail causes these segments to vibrate against one another, making the rattling noise (which is amplified because the segments are hollow).<ref name="price-38-39" /><ref>{{cite book|chapter=Rattlesnake|editors=Burton, Maurice & Burton, Robert|title=The international wildlife encyclopedia, Volume 1|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=1970|isbn=978-0-7614-7266-7|page=2119|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=saySBl8hC_4C&pg=PA2119}}</ref><ref name="wva" /> The muscles that cause the rattle to shake are some of the fastest known, firing 50 times per second on average, sustained for up to three hours.<ref name="zoo-1030">{{cite book|author=Graham, Karen S.|chapter=Rattlesnake|editor=Bell, Catharine E.|title=Encyclopedia of the world's zoos, Volume 3|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2001|isbn=978-1-57958-174-9|page=1040|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8DT4xOpIzS0C&pg=PA1040}}</ref>

At birth, a “pre-button” is present at the tip of the snake's tail; it is replaced by the “button” several days later when the first skin is shed.  However, no sound can be made by the rattle until a second segment is added when the skin is shed again.<ref>
[http://www.rattlesnakes.com/info/rattles.html  American International Rattlesnake Museum: Rattles, (Accessed: May 4, 2012)]</ref>  A new rattle segment is added each time the snake sheds its skin. They may shed their skins several times a year depending on food supply and growth rates. Rattlesnakes travel with their rattles held up to protect them from damage, but in spite of this precaution, their day-to-day activities in the wild still cause them to regularly break off end segments. Because of this, there is no way to determine the age of a rattlesnake based on the number of rattles on its tail.<ref name="price-38-39" /><ref name="wva">{{cite book|author=Fergus, Charles|title=Wildlife of Virginia and Maryland and Washington, Part 3|publisher=Stackpole Books|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8117-2821-8|page=460|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W7UxSPd2XMAC&pg=PA460}}</ref><ref name="zoo-1030" />

One of the differentiating features of males and females is that males have thicker and longer tails (because they contain the inverted [[Hemipenis|hemipenes]]). Also, the tails of males taper gradually from the body, whereas the tails of females narrow abruptly at the vent.<ref>Klauber, 1997: [http://books.google.com/books?id=mpTKB1P5VEYC&pg=PA690 p. 690]</ref>

===Skin and circulation===

Rattlesnake skin is composed of a set of overlapping scales which cover the entire body, providing protection from a variety of threats including [[dehydration]] and physical trauma.<ref>Rubio, 1998: p. 48</ref> The skin of snakes is highly sensitive to contact, tension, and pressure; and they are capable of feeling [[pain]].<ref name="Rubio-69">Rubio, 1998: p. 69</ref>

An important function of the skin is the sensation of changes in [[air temperature]], which can guide the snakes towards warm basking/shelter locations.<ref name="Adams-2" /> All snakes are [[ectotherms]]. In order to maintain a stable body temperature, they exchange heat with their external environment. Snakes often move into open, sunny areas to absorb heat from the sun and warmed earth - a behavior known as [[Ectotherm|basking]]. [[Nerves]] in the skin regulate the flow of blood into the [[veins]] near the surface. Rubio states that "The skin's acceptance of radiant energy, its ability to determine the temperature, and the snake's ability to move toward or away from one [[temperature gradient]] to another are among the most important behavioral actions in its daily life."<ref name="Rubio-69" />

The skin of rattlesnakes is intricately patterned in a manner that [[camouflages]] them from their predators.<ref name="Adams-2">{{cite book|title=Texas Rattlesnake Roundups|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-60344-035-6|page=2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DU0zHaVSqeAC&pg=PA2|author=Adams, Clark E. & Thomas, John K.}}</ref><ref>Rubio, 1998: p. 38</ref> Rattlesnakes do not generally have bright or showy colors (reds, yellows, blues etc.), instead relying on subtle earth tones that resemble the surrounding environment.<ref>Rubio, 1998: p. 39</ref>

There are creases in the epidermal tissue which connects the scales of rattlesnakes. When ingesting large prey, these creases can unfold, allowing the skin to expand to envelop a much greater volume. It appears that the skin is tightly stretching to accommodate the meal, but in reality, the skin is simply smoothing out from its creased state and is not under very high tension.<ref>Rubio, 1998: p. 50</ref>

==Reproduction==
[[File:Rattlesnake Dance 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Two male [[Northern Pacific Rattlenakes]] (''[[Crotalus oreganus]] oreganus'') engage in a "combat dance"]]
[[File:Rattlesnake hemipene.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Everted [[hemipenis]] of a male ''[[Crotalus adamanteus|C. adamanteus]]'']]
Most rattlesnake species mate during the summer or fall, while some species mate only in the spring, or during both the spring and fall.<ref name="rubio-106">Rubio, 1998: p. 106</ref>

Females secrete small amounts of [[sex pheromones]], which leave a trail that males follow by using their tongue and [[Jacobson's organ]] as a guide.<ref name="rubio-106" /> Once a receptive female has been located, the male will often spend several days following her around (a behavior that is not common outside of the mating season), frequently touching and rubbing her in an attempt to stimulate her.<ref name="rubio-110" /><ref>Klauber, 1997: [http://books.google.com/books?id=mpTKB1P5VEYC&pg=PA702 p. 702]</ref>

The males of some species, such as timber rattlesnakes (''C. horridus''), will fight each other during the mating season, in competition over females. These fights known as "combat dances" consist of the two males intertwining the anterior portion of their bodies, often with the head and neck held vertically. The larger males usually end up driving the smaller males away.<ref>Furman, 2007: [http://books.google.com/books?id=S5bM83jWl9YC&pg=PA32 p. 32]</ref><ref>Rubio, 1998: p. 109</ref>

Although many kinds of snakes and other reptiles are [[oviparous]] (lay eggs), rattlesnakes are [[viviparous]] (give birth to live young).<ref>Klauber, 1997: p. 1280</ref> The female produces the [[Ovum|ova]] ("eggs") in her [[ovaries]], after which they pass through the body cavity and into one of her two [[oviducts]]. The ova are arranged in a continuous chain in a coiled section of the oviduct, known as the "tuba".<ref name="rubio-110" /> Male rattlesnakes have sexual organs known as [[hemipenes]], located in the base of the tail. The hemipenis is retracted inside of the body when mating is not occurring. Females can store semen for months in internal recesses known as [[spermathecae]], which permits them to mate during the fall, but not fertilize the ova until the following spring.<ref name="rubio-110">Rubio, 1998: p. 110</ref> The Arizona black rattlesnake (''C. oreganus cerberus''), has been observed to exhibit complex social behavior reminiscent of that in mammals. Females often remain with their young in nests for several weeks, and mothers have been observed cooperatively parenting their broods.<ref>Amerello, Melissa; Smith, Jeffrey; and Slone, John. 2011. Family values: Maternal care in rattlesnakes is more than mere attendance. Nature Precedings. <http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/npre.2011.6671.1>.</ref>

Rattlesnakes generally take several years to mature, and females usually reproduce only once every three years.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Hammerson, Geoffrey A.|title=Connecticut wildlife: biodiversity, natural history, and conservation|publisher=UPNE|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58465-369-1|page=328|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FWc3zDq9P10C&pg=PA328}}</ref>

==Hibernation==
Some rattlesnake species [[hibernate]] in the colder winter months. They often gather together for hibernation in very large numbers (sometimes over 1,000 snakes), huddling together inside underground "rattlesnake dens" or ''hibernacula''.<ref name="Rubio-96">Rubio, 1998: p. 96</ref><ref>Klauber, 1997: [http://books.google.com/books?id=mpTKB1P5VEYC&pg=PA573 p. 573]</ref> Rattlesnakes will regularly share their winter [[burrow]]s with a wide variety of other species (such as [[turtles]], small mammals, [[invertebrates]], and other types of snakes).<ref name="Rubio-96" />

Rattlesnakes often return to the same den, year after year, sometimes traveling several miles to get there. It is not known exactly how the rattlesnakes find their way back to the dens each year, but it has been hypothesized that they use a combination of [[pheromone]] trails and visual cues (e.g. [[topography]], [[celestial navigation]], and [[sun|solar]] orientation).<ref>Rubio, 1998: pp. 96-97</ref>

Species with long periods of hibernation tend to have much lower reproductive rates than those with shorter hibernation periods, or those that don't hibernate at all. Female timber rattlesnakes in high peaks in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of [[New England]] reproduce every three years on average; the lance-headed rattlesnake (''[[Crotalus polystictus|C. polystictus]]''), native to the warm climate of Mexico, reproduces annually.<ref>Furman, 2005: [http://books.google.com/books?id=S5bM83jWl9YC&pg=PA33 p. 33]</ref>

Like most other snakes, rattlesnakes [[aestivate]] during very hot or dry periods, which is why they are very rarely seen during the hottest and driest months of summer.<ref>Rubio, 1998: p. 100</ref>

==Conservation status==
Rattlesnakes tend to avoid developed areas, preferring undisturbed, natural habitats. Rapid habitat destruction by humans, mass killings during events like [[rattlesnake round-ups]], and deliberate extermination campaigns all pose severe threats to rattlesnake populations in many areas. Several species of rattlesnakes, such as the timber rattler, [[massasauga]], and canebrake rattlesnake are listed as threatened or endangered in many U.S. states.<ref>Rubio, 1998: pp. 200-203</ref>

A very large number of rattlesnakes die from being run over by cars.<ref name="Rubio-120" />

In more heavily populated and trafficked areas, there have been increasing reports of rattlesnakes that do not rattle. This phenomenon is commonly attributed to [[selective pressure]] by humans, who often kill the snakes when they are discovered.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2001-07-22/news/17609260_1_rattle-snakes-venomous | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Rattlesnake danger grows as more serpents strike without warning | date=June 24, 2011}}</ref> Non-rattling snakes are more likely to go unnoticed, and therefore survive to reproduce offspring who, like themselves, are less likely to rattle.

==Safety and first aid==
[[File:Caution, rattlesnakes (sign).jpg|thumb|right|A rattlesnake warning sign in California]]

Rattlesnakes are the leading cause of snakebite injuries in North America and a significant cause in Central and South America.<ref name="luch-267">{{cite book|editor=Luch, Andreas|title=Molecular, Clinical and Environmental Toxicology|volume=2|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-3-7643-8337-4|page=267|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Q_2TslBNPa8C&pg=PA267}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|editor=Mackessy, Stephen P.|title=Handbook of venoms and toxins of reptiles|publisher=CRC Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8493-9165-1|page=476|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=x_vME799de4C&pg=PA476}}</ref>

===Avoiding bites===
Rattlesnakes tend to avoid wide open spaces where they cannot hide from predators and will generally avoid humans if they are aware of their approach.<ref>{{cite book|editors=Phillips, Steven J. et al.|title=A natural history of the Sonoran Desert|publisher=University of California Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-520-21980-9|page=577|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Lb5I0tcnYNkC&pg=PA577}}</ref> Rattlesnakes rarely bite unless they feel threatened or provoked. A majority of victims (~ 72%<ref>{{cite journal |author=O'Neil ME, Mack KA, Gilchrist J, Wozniak EJ |title=Snakebite injuries treated in United States emergency departments, 2001-2004 |journal=Wilderness Environ Med |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=281–7 |year=2007 |pmid=18076294 |doi=10.1580/06-WEME-OR-080R1.1 }}</ref>) are males, often young and intoxicated. Approximately half of bites occur in cases where the victim saw the snake yet made no effort to move away.<ref name="cetaruk-1075">{{cite book|author=Cetaruk, Edward W.|chapter=Rattlesnakes and Other Crotalids|editor=Brent, Jeffrey|title=Critical care toxicology: diagnosis and management of the critically poisoned patient|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8151-4387-1|page=1075|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WuA4LsWXXWEC&pg=PA1075}}</ref>

Hikers and campers should avoid contact with rattlesnakes by remaining observant and not approaching the animals. Hikers should be particularly careful when negotiating fallen logs or boulders and when near rocky outcroppings and ledges where rattlesnakes may be hiding or sunning themselves. Snakes will occasionally sun themselves in the middle of an open trail so such areas are not the only places where they are encountered. Hikers are advised to keep their distance when encountering a rattlesnake on a trail and allow the snake room to retreat.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Caution is advised even when snakes are believed to be dead; rattlesnake heads can see, flick the tongue, and inflict venomous bites for up to an hour after being severed from the body.<ref>{{cite book|editors=Werler, John E. & Dixon, James Ray|title=Texas snakes: identification, distribution, and natural history|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-292-79130-5|page=3|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7jKuAWavrUkC&pg=PA3}}</ref><ref>Barceloux, 2008: [http://books.google.com/books?id=CpqzhHc072AC&pg=PA1027 p. 1027]</ref>

===Effect of bites on humans===
[[File:Snake Bite injury.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Rattlesnake bite injury]]

Rattlesnake bites are rarely fatal to humans if treated promptly.<ref name="schoenherr-510" /> An estimated 7,000 to 8,000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the United States each year with approximately five deaths.<ref>{{cite web |author=Henkel, John|title=For Goodness Snakes! Treating and Preventing Venomous Bites|work=Reptiles|publisher=USDA / emergency response|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/emergency_response/downloads/health/Appendix%203-6-E%20Reptiles.pdf|accessdate=2009-06-15}}</ref> The most important factor in survival following a severe envenomation is the amount of time elapsed between the bite and treatment. Most deaths occur between 6 and 48 hours after the bite. If antivenom treatment is given within 2 hours of the bite, however, the probability of recovery is greater than 99%.<ref>Rubio, 1998: p. 143</ref>

When a bite occurs the amount of venom injected is under voluntary control by the snake. The amount released depends on a variety of factors including the condition of the snake (e.g. having long, healthy fangs and a full venom sack) and its temperament (an angry, hungry snake that has just been stepped on vs. a satiated snake that was merely surprised by walking near it).<ref name="Fleisher-1548">{{cite book|editors=Fleisher, Gary R. & Ludwig, Stephen|title=Textbook of Pediatric Emergency Medicine|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year=2010|edition=6th|isbn=978-1-60547-159-4|page=1548|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=a7CqcE1ZrFkC&pg=RA1-PA1548}}</ref> Approximately 20% of bites result in no envenomation at all. A lack of burning pain and [[edema]] {{convert|3/8|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} away from the fang marks after 1 hour suggests that either no or minimal envenomation occurred. A lack of edema or [[erythema]] in the area of the bite after 8 hours indicates a lack of envenomation for most rattlesnake bites.<ref name="Barceloux-1030">Barceloux, 2008: [http://books.google.com/books?id=CpqzhHc072AC&pg=PA1030 p. 1030]</ref>

Common symptoms include swelling, severe pain, tingling, weakness, anxiety, [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[hemorrhaging]], [[perspiration]], and eventually [[cardiac arrest|heart failure]].<ref name="Fleisher-1548" /><ref>Klauber, 1997: [http://books.google.com/books?id=W8Tz8QaJ2HoC&pg=PA859 p. 859]</ref> Local pain following envenomation is often intense, increasing with the ensuing edema.<ref name="Fleisher-1548" /> Children generally experience more severe symptoms because they receive a larger amount of venom per unit of body mass.<ref name="Barceloux-1030" />

===Emergency response===

Data on the effectiveness of first aid techniques for rattlesnake bites is limited.<ref name="Barceloux-1033">Barceloux, 2008: [http://books.google.com/books?id=CpqzhHc072AC&pg=PA1033 p. 1033]</ref> General recommendations for first aid in the field are:

# Remain calm and retreat from the snake at least 15 feet. Arrange to have the victim transported to a medical facility as soon as possible.<ref name="Barceloux-1033" />
# Remove restrictive clothing items (rings, bracelets, watches, buttoned shirts, etc.) from the victim.<ref name="Barceloux-1033" /><ref name="Tibballs-1693">{{cite book|chapter=Envenomations|editors=Wheeler, David S. et al.|title=Pediatric Critical Care Medicine: Basic Science and Clinical Evidence|publisher=Springer|year=2010|edition=6th|isbn=978-1-84628-463-2|page=1693|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ml5bx1PxxOQC&pg=PA1693|author=Tibballs, James et al.}}</ref>

# Keep victims calm; put them at rest; keep them warm and give them comfort and reassurance (which will lower their heart rate, slowing the spread of the venom). Keeping a victim's [[heart rate]] down, however, this should never interfere with getting him or her to a medical facility.<ref name="Barceloux-1033" />

In no case should [[tourniquets]] be used, nor should any incisions or suction be applied to the wound.<ref name="Barceloux-1033" /><ref name="Taylor-632" />

===Antivenom===
Crotaline [[antivenom]] (or "antivenin") is commonly used to treat the effects of local and systemic pit viper envenomations.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Goldfrank, Lewis R.|title=Goldfrank's toxicologic emergencies|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2006|edition=8th|isbn=978-0-07-147914-1|page=1657|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cvJuLqBxGUcC&pg=PA1657}}</ref> The first step in the production of crotaline antivenom is collecting ("milking") the venom of a live rattlesnake—usually from the Western Diamondback (''[[Crotalus atrox]]''), Eastern Diamondback (''[[Crotalus adamanteus]]''), South American rattlesnake (''[[Crotalus durissis]] terrificus''), or fer-de-lance (''[[Bothrops atrox]]''). The extracted venom is then diluted and injected into horses, goats, or sheep, whose immune systems produce [[antibodies]] that protect from the toxic effects of the venom. These antibodies accumulate in the blood, which is then extracted and [[centrifuged]] to separate the [[red blood cells]]. The resulting serum is purified into a [[lyophilized]] powder, which is packaged for distribution and later use by human patients.<ref>Barceloux, 2008: [http://books.google.com/books?id=CpqzhHc072AC&pg=PA1036 p. 1036]</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Texas Rattlesnake Roundups|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-60344-035-6|page=23|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DU0zHaVSqeAC&pg=PA23|author=Adams, Clark E. & Thomas, John K.}}</ref>

Because antivenom is derived from animal antibodies, people generally display an [[allergic]] response during infusion, known as [[serum sickness]].<ref>{{cite book|editors=Meier, Jürg & White, Julian|title=Handbook of clinical toxicology of animal venoms and poisons, Volume 236|publisher=CRC Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-8493-4489-3|page=639|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OvFxypZGPAAC&pg=PA639}}</ref><ref>Rubio, 1998: p. 145</ref>

===Veterinary care===
In the United States, more than 15,000 domesticated animals are bitten by snakes each year. Rattlesnake envenomations account for 80% of the deadly incidents.<ref>{{cite book|author=Slatter, Douglas H.|title=Textbook of small animal surgery|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7216-8607-3|page=267|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B_nh6zSr4wUC&pg=PA267}}</ref>

[[Dogs]] are most commonly bitten on the front legs and head. [[Horses]] generally receive bites on the [[muzzle (animal)|muzzle]], and [[cattle]] on their tongues and muzzles. If a [[domestication|domesticated]] animal is bitten, the hair around the bite should be removed, so that the wound can be clearly seen. The crotaline Fab antivenom has been shown to be effective in the treatment of canine rattlesnake bites. Symptoms include; swelling, slight bleeding, sensitivity, shaking, and anxiety.<ref name="Gupta-800-801" />

==In human culture==
===Spirituality===
[[File:Featheredserpentmuseoantropologia.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Stone sculptures of [[Feathered Serpent (deity)|feathered serpents]] on display at the National Museum of Anthropology in [[Mexico City]].]]
====Indigenous Americans====
[[Aztec]] paintings, Central American temples, and the great burial mounds in the southeastern U.S. are frequently adorned with depictions of rattlesnakes, often within the symbols and emblems of the most powerful deities.<ref>{{cite book|author=Browman, David L. & Williams, Stephen|title=New perspectives on the origins of Americanist archaeology|publisher=University of Alabama Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8173-1128-5|page=99|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=niYaFKcLCs8C&pg=PA99}}</ref>

The [[Feathered Serpent (deity)|Feathered Serpent deity]] of [[Olmec]], [[Aztec]] and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] cultures  was depicted as having the combined features of the [[quetzal bird]] and rattlesnake.<ref>{{cite book|editors=Read, Kay A. & González, Jason J.|chapter=Feathered Serpents|title=Mesoamerican Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs of Mexico and Central America|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-19-514909-8|page=180|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Y053PeFmS5UC&pg=PA180}}</ref> The [[Maya civilization|Ancient Maya]] considered the rattlesnake to be a "vision serpent" that acted as a conduit to the "otherworld".<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Maya Geography and Mythology|editors=Foster, Lynn V. & Mathews, Peter|title=Handbook to life in the ancient Maya world|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-518363-4|page=91|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eHwLgl2dMg0C&pg=PA91}}</ref>

Rattlesnakes are a key element in [[Aztec mythology]] and were widely represented in [[Aztec]] art including sculptures, jewelry, architectural elements, etc.

====Christian snake handling sects====
[[File:snakehandling.png|right|200px|thumb|[[Snake handling]] at the [[Pentecostal Church]] of God in the town of Lejunior, [[Harlan County, Kentucky]] September 15, 1946]]
Members of some [[Christian]] sects in the southern United States are regularly bitten while participating in "[[snake handling]]" rituals. Snake handling is when people hold venomous snakes, unprotected, as part of a religious service inspired by a literal interpretation of the [[Bible]] verse Mark 16:17-18 which reads "In my name ... they will pick up snakes with their hands".<ref name="cetaruk-1075" /><ref>For a more detailed study of [[snake handling]] sects, see {{cite book|author=Kimbrough, David L.|year=2002|title=Taking up serpents: snake handlers of eastern Kentucky|publisher=Mercer University Press|isbn=978-0-86554-798-8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8Wq1s7ChmmIC}}</ref>

===As a food===
