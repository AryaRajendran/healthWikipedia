An '''aura''' is a perceptual disturbance experienced by some [[migraine]] sufferers before a migraine headache, and the telltale sensation experienced by some people with [[epilepsy]] before or after a [[seizure]]. It often manifests as the perception of a strange light, an unpleasant smell or confusing thoughts or experiences. Some people experience aura without a subsequent migraine or seizure (see [[silent migraine]]).

When occurring, auras allow people with epilepsy time to prevent injury to themselves and/or others. The time between the appearance of the aura and the migraine lasts from a few seconds up to an hour. The aura can stay with a migraine sufferer for the duration of the migraine; depending on the type of aura, this can leave the person disoriented and confused.  It is not uncommon for migraine sufferers to experience more than one type of aura during the migraine. Most people who have auras have the same type of aura every time.  

Auras can also be confused with sudden onset of panic, [[panic attacks]] or [[anxiety]] attacks creating difficulties in diagnosis. The [[differential diagnosis]] of patients who experience symptoms of [[paresthesias]], [[derealization]], dizziness, chest pain, tremors, and palpitations can be quite challenging.<ref>[http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/18/4/436#R11. Sudden Onset Panic: Epileptic Aura or Panic Disorder?] Robin A. Hurley, M.D., Ronald Fisher, M.D., Ph.D. and Katherine H. Taber, Ph.D.</ref>

** Shimmering, pulsating patches, often curved
** [[Tunnel vision]]
* [[Scotoma]]
** Blind or dark spots in the field of vision
** Curtain-like effect over one eye
** Slowly spreading spots
* [[Kaleidoscope]] effects on visual field
* Total temporary monocular (in one eye) blindness (in [[retinal migraine]])<ref>Robert, Teri.  "Living Well With Migraine Disease and Headaches" New York HarperCollins 2004</ref>
* Heightened sensitivity to light

===Auditory changes===
* Hearing voices or sounds that do not exist: true [[auditory hallucinations]]
* Modification of voices or sounds in the environment: buzzing, [[tremolo]], [[amplitude modulation]] or other modulations
* Heightened sensitivity to hearing 
* Someone speaking at a level and normal tone sounds like they are shouting loudly

===Other sensations===
* Strange smells ([[Phantosmia]]) or tastes ([[Gustatory hallucination]]s), or where food and drinks taste different than usual
* Heightened sensitivity to smell
* Feelings of [[déjà vu]] or confusion
* Feelings of numbness or tingling on one side of the face or body

* Being unable to read
* Temporary amnesia, such as forgetting how to do tasks you have been doing for years
* Lightheadedness 
* Feeling of floating above one's body.

==Uses==
The specific type of sensation associated with an aura can potentially be used in an attempt to localize the focus of a seizure.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Auras share similar symptoms with [[stroke]]s, but onset is more gradual with auras.<ref>Better Health Channel. [http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Stroke_and_migraine?OpenDocument Stroke and Migraine.] Government of Victoria, Australia.  Accessed August 18, 2007.</ref>  Auras can last from several seconds to as long as an hour, and can sometimes end with feelings of extreme tiredness, weakness, heart [[palpitation]], sweating and warmth throughout one's body.

The onset of an aura can provide an early warning for those experiencing migraines.
