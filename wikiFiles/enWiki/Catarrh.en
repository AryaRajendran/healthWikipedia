'''Catarrh''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|k|ə|ˈ|t|ɑr}}) is a disorder of inflammation of the mucous membranes in one of the airways or cavities of the body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catarrh |title=Catarrh - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/03/news/chronic-catarrh-its-symptoms-causes-effects-few-practical-remarks-dr-lighthill.html?scp=1&sq=catarrh&st=cse |title=CHRONIC CATARRH - ITS SYMPTOMS, CAUSES AND EFFECTS. - A FEW PRACTICAL REMARKS BY DR.

It is a [[symptom]] usually associated with the [[common cold]] and chesty [[cough]]s, but can also be found in patients with infections of the [[adenoid]]s, [[otitis media|middle ear]], [[sinusitis|sinus]] or [[tonsilitis|tonsils]].  The [[phlegm]] produced by catarrh may either discharge or cause a blockage which may become [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]].

==Problems caused by catarrh==
A catarrh blockage may result in discomfort with (and what is known as [[ear fear]] of):
*[[elevator]]s
*[[fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] and [[helicopter]]s
*traveling at elevation
*[[swimming pool]]s and jumping [[bathing|baths]]
and other activities associated with a change in pressure.

Even the shallow end of a swimming [[bathing|bath]] can be troublesome; [[barotrauma]] -- a problem linked to head pressure changes which is affected by catarrh blockages—can occur in as little as {{convert|4|ft|m}} of water depth.

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary}}
The word "[[wikt:catarrh|catarrh]]" comes from the Greek "katarrhein": ''kata-'' meaning "down" and ''rhein'' meaning "to flow."
