'''Transgenerational trauma''' is a trauma that was transferred from the first generation of survivors that have experienced (or witnessed) it directly in the past to the second and further generations of offspring of the survivors via ''[[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]]'' mechanisms.

==History==

Soon after descriptions of the so-called ''concentration camp syndrome'' (also known as [[survivor syndrome]]) appeared, clinicians observed in 1966 that large numbers of children of [[Holocaust]] survivors were seeking treatment in clinics in [[Canada]]. The grandchildren of Holocaust survivors were overrepresented by 300% among the referrals to a child psychiatry clinic in comparison with their representation in the general population.<ref>Fossion, P., Rejas, M., Servais, L., Pelc, I. & Hirsch, S. (2003). "Family approach with grandchildren of Holocaust survivors," ''American Journal of Psychotherapy,'' 57(4), 519-527.</ref> 

The phenomenon of children of traumatized parents being affected directly or indirectly by their parents’ post-traumatic symptoms has been described by some authors as ''secondary traumatisation'' (in reference to the ''second generation''). To include the ''third generation'', as well, the term intergenerational transmission of trauma was introduced.

Both survivors and immediate witnesses of traumatic events in family history has traditionally been treated by family therapist. The first-generation experiences of combat veterans, hostages, prisoners of war, and the civil population who was victimized at the hands of [[war criminals]] from genocidal organizations such as [[NSDAP]] in Nazi Germany, [[Mario Roatta|Fascist]] party in Italy and similar organizations and their (para-)military arms, have been dealt with within the confines of political arena and international law, however the descendants of both immediate witnesses and victims of genocide, colonial suppression, slavery, political totalitarian control, clerical abuse in religious organizations, and many survivors of [[terrorism]] had to deal with the [[victimization sequelae symptoms|victimization symptoms]] themselves, without the transfer of original trauma being recognized and help offered.

==Trauma transmission pathways==

Neurobiological explanations suggest that the trauma transfer pathways include right brain and the trauma is transferred to offspring unintentionally and unconsciously.
