'''Alexander Johnston Chalmers Skene''' (17 June 1837â€“4 July 1900) was a [[British Citizenship|British]] ([[Scotland|Scottish]]) [[gynaecologist]] who described what became known as the [[Skene's glands]].

==Biography==
Skene was born in [[Fyvie]], [[Scotland]], [[United Kingdom]] on 17 June 1837.  At the age of 19, he went to America. He studied medicine at King's College (now the [[University of Toronto]]), then at the [[University of Michigan]], and finally at the [[Long Island College Hospital]] (now the [[State University of New York Downstate Medical Center]]) in [[Brooklyn]] graduating in 1863. From July 1863 until June 1864, he was acting assistant surgeon in the [[U. S. Army]], after which he entered private practice in Brooklyn and advanced to become Professor of Disease of Women at Long Island College Hospital. He was professor of gynaecology in the Post-graduate Medical School of New York in 1884, and was president of the [[American Gynaecological Society]].

Skene wrote over 100 medical articles and several textbooks. He contributed many surgical instruments and improved on surgical techniques. He performed the first successful operation of gastro-elytrotomy that is recorded, and also that of craniotomy, using [[Sims's speculum]]. Primarily, he is remembered for his description of the [[Skene's glands]] at the floor of the [[urethra]]. He also described their infection - ''skenitis''.

As a sculptor, Skene created a bust of [[J. Marion Sims]], which is on display in the lobby of the Kings County Medical Society. A bust honoring him is located in [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] Plaza (also known as [[Grand Army Plaza]]).  This statue was moved in 2011 to accommodate a statue of Abraham Lincoln, a former U.S. president.

Skene died in his summerhouse in the [[Catskills]], New York on July 4, 1900. He left behind a son, Jonathan Bowers.
