'''Phenylketonuria''' ('''PKU''') is an [[Dominance (genetics)|autosomal recessive]] metabolic [[genetic disorder]] characterized by a mutation in the gene for the hepatic enzyme [[phenylalanine hydroxylase]] (PAH), rendering it nonfunctional.<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |last2=Berger |first2=Timothy G. |display-authors=3}}</ref>{{Rp|541}} This enzyme is necessary to metabolize the amino acid [[phenylalanine]] (Phe) to the amino acid [[tyrosine]].

==History==
Phenylketonuria was discovered by the [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] physician [[Ivar Asbjørn Følling]] in 1934<ref name="Folling">{{cite journal | author=Folling, A. | year=1934 | title=Ueber Ausscheidung von Phenylbrenztraubensaeure in den Harn als Stoffwechselanomalie in Verbindung mit Imbezillitaet | journal=Ztschr. Physiol. Chem. | volume=227 | pages=169–176}}</ref> when he noticed hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) was associated with mental retardation. In Norway, this disorder is known as '''Følling's disease''', named after its discoverer.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Centerwall, S. A. & Centerwall, W. R. | year=2000 | title=The discovery of phenylketonuria: the story of a young couple, two affected children, and a scientist | url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/105/1/89 | journal=Pediatrics | volume=105 | pages=89–103 | pmid=10617710 | doi=10.1542/peds.105.1.89 | issue=1 Pt 1}}</ref> Dr. Følling was one of the first physicians to apply detailed chemical analysis to the study of disease. His careful analysis of the urine of two affected siblings led him to request many physicians near Oslo to test the urine of other affected patients. This led to the discovery of the same substance he had found in eight other patients. He conducted tests and found reactions that gave rise to [[benzaldehyde]] and [[benzoic acid]], which led him to conclude that the compound contained a [[benzene]] ring. Further testing showed the [[melting point]] to be the same as [[phenylpyruvic acid]], which indicated that the substance was in the urine. His careful science inspired many to pursue similar meticulous and painstaking research with other disorders. It was recently suggested that PKU may resemble [[amyloid]] diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, due to the formation of toxic amyloid-like assemblies of phenylalanine.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Adler-Abramovich  | year=2012| title=Phenylalanine assembly into toxic fibrils suggests amyloid etiology in phenylketonuria | url=http://www.nature.com/nchembio/journal/v8/n8/full/nchembio.1002.html | journal=Nature Chemical Biology | volume=8| pages=:701–706 | pmid=22706200 | doi=10.1038/nchembio.1002 | issue=8}}</ref>

==Screening and presentation==
[[Image:Phenylketonuria testing.jpg|right|thumb|Blood is taken from a two-week old infant to test for phenylketonuria]]
PKU is commonly included in the [[newborn screening]] panel of most countries, with varied detection techniques. Most babies in developed countries are screened for PKU soon after birth.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last=Mayo Clinic Staff | coauthors= | title=Phenylketonuria (PKU) | date=2007-12-20 | publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]] | url =http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/phenylketonuria/DS00514/DSECTION=1 | accessdate = 2008-03-13 | language = }}</ref>  Screening for PKU is done with bacterial inhibition assay ([[Guthrie test]]), immunoassays using fluorometric or photometric detection, or amino acid measurement using [[tandem mass spectrometry]] (MS/MS).  Measurements done using MS/MS determine the concentration of Phe and the ratio of Phe to [[tyrosine]], both of which will be elevated in PKU.<ref name=sarafaglou>{{cite book|title=Pediatric Endocrinology and Inborn Errors of Metabolism|editor1-last=Sarafoglou |editor1-first=Kyriakie|editor2-last=Hoffmann |editor2-first=Georg F.|editor3-last=Roth|editor3-first=Karl S.|publisher=McGraw Hill Medical|location=New York|page=26}}</ref>

If a child is not screened during the routine newborn screening test (typically performed 2 – 7 days after birth, using samples drawn by [[neonatal heel prick]]), the disease may present clinically with [[seizure]]s, [[albinism]] (excessively fair hair and skin), and a "musty odor" to the baby's sweat and urine (due to [[phenylacetic acid|phenylacetate]], one of the ketones produced). In most cases, a repeat test should be done at approximately two weeks of age to verify the initial test and uncover any phenylketonuria that was initially missed.

Untreated  children are normal at birth, but fail to attain early developmental milestones, develop [[microcephaly]], and demonstrate progressive impairment of cerebral function. [[Hyperactivity]], [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] abnormalities, and seizures, and severe [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] are major clinical problems later in life. A "musty or mousy" odor of skin, hair, sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate accumulation), as well as a tendency towards [[hypopigmentation]] and [[eczema]], are also observed. 

In contrast, affected children who are detected and treated are less likely to develop neurological problems or have seizures and mental retardation, though such clinical disorders are still possible.

==Pathophysiology==
===Classical PKU===
Classical PKU is caused by a mutated gene for the [[enzyme]] [[phenylalanine hydroxylase]] (PAH), which converts the amino acid phenylalanine to other essential compounds in the body. Other non-PAH mutations can also cause PKU. This is an example of non-allelic [[genetic heterogeneity]].  The PAH gene is located on [[chromosome 12 (human)|chromosome 12]] in the bands 12q22-q24.1. More than 400 disease-causing mutations have been found in the PAH gene. PAH deficiency causes a spectrum of disorders, including classic phenylketonuria (PKU) and hyperphenylalaninemia (a less severe accumulation of phenylalanine).<ref>[http://www.genenames.org/data/hgnc_data.php?hgnc_id=8582 http://www.genenames.org] Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene summary, retrieved September 8, 2006</ref>

PKU is known to be an [[Dominance (genetics)|autosomal recessive]] genetic disorder. This means both parents must have at least one mutated [[allele]] of the PAH gene. The child must inherit both mutated alleles, one from each parent. Therefore, it is possible for a parent with the disease to have a child without it if the other parent possesses one functional allele of the gene for PAH. Yet, a child from two parents with PKU will inherit two mutated alleles every time, and therefore the disease. 

Phenylketonuria can exist in mice, which have been extensively used in experiments into finding an effective treatment for it.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Oh, H. J., Park, E.

C.}}</ref>

===Tetrahydrobiopterin-deficient hyperphenylalaninemia===
A rarer form of hyperphenylalaninemia occurs when PAH is normal, but there is a defect in the biosynthesis or recycling of the [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] [[tetrahydrobiopterin]] (BH<sub>4</sub>) by the patient.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Surtees, R., Blau, N. | year=2000 | title=The neurochemistry of phenylketonuria | journal=European Journal of Pediatrics | volume=169 | pages=S109–S113 | pmid=11043156 | doi=10.1007/PL00014370}}</ref> This cofactor is necessary for proper activity of the enzyme . The [[coenzyme]] (called [[biopterin]]) can be supplemented as treatment. Those who suffer from PKU must be supplemented with tyrosine to account for phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in converting phenylalanine to tyrosine sufficiently. Dihydrobiopterin reductase activity is to replenish quinonoid-dihydrobiopterin back into its tetrahydrobiopterin form, which is an important cofactor in many metabolic reactions in amino acid metabolism. Those with this deficiency may produce sufficient levels of phenylalanine hydroxylase, but since tetrahydrobiopterin is a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase activity, deficient dihydrobiopterin reductase renders any phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme produced unable to use phenylalanine to produce tyrosine. Tetrahydrobiopterin is also a cofactor in the production of L-DOPA from tyrosine and 5-Hydroxy-L-Tryptophan from tryptophan, which must also be supplemented as treatment in addition to the supplements for classical PKU.

Levels of [[dopamine]] can be used to distinguish between these two types. [[Tetrahydrobiopterin]] is required to convert phenylalanine to [[tyrosine]], but it is also required to convert tyrosine to [[L-DOPA]] (via the enzyme [[tyrosine hydroxylase]]), which in turn is converted to [[dopamine]]. Low levels of dopamine lead to high levels of [[prolactin]]. By contrast, in classical PKU, prolactin levels would be relatively normal.
[[Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency]] can be caused by defects in four different genes. These types are known as HPABH4A, HPABH4B, HPABH4C, and HPABH4D.<ref>{{OMIM|261640}}</ref>

==Metabolic pathways==
The enzyme [[phenylalanine hydroxylase]] normally converts the [[amino acid]] [[phenylalanine]] into the amino acid [[tyrosine]]. If this reaction does not take place, phenylalanine accumulates and tyrosine is deficient. Excessive phenylalanine can be metabolized into phenylketones through the minor route, a [[transaminase]] pathway with [[glutamic acid|glutamate]]. Metabolites include [[phenylacetic acid|phenylacetate]], [[phenylpyruvate]] and [[phenethylamine]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Michals, K., Matalon, R. | title=Phenylalanine metabolites, attention span and hyperactivity | journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | year=1985 | volume=42 | pages=361–5 | pmid=4025205 | issue=2}}</ref> Elevated levels of phenylalanine in the blood and detection of phenylketones in the urine is diagnostic, however most patients are diagnosed via newborn screening.

Phenylalanine is a large, neutral amino acid (LNAA). LNAAs compete for transport across the [[blood–brain barrier]] (BBB) via the [[CD98|large neutral amino acid transporter]] (LNAAT). If phenylalanine is in excess in the blood, it will saturate the transporter. Excessive levels of phenylalanine tend to decrease the levels of other LNAAs in the brain. However, as these amino acids are necessary for protein and neurotransmitter synthesis, Phe buildup hinders the development of the [[Human brain|brain]], causing [[mental retardation]].<ref name="Pietz">{{cite journal | author=Pietz, J., Kreis, R., Rupp, A., Mayatepek, E., Rating, D., Boesch, C., Bremer, H. J. | year=1999 | url=http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/103/8/1169 | title=Large neutral amino acids block phenylalanine transport into brain tissue in patients with phenylketonuria | journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume=103 | pages=1169–1178 | pmid=10207169 | doi = 10.1172/JCI5017 | issue=8 | pmc=408272}}</ref>

==Treatment==
If PKU is diagnosed early enough, an affected newborn can grow up with normal brain development, but only by managing and controlling Phe levels through diet, or a combination of diet and medication. [[Optimal health ranges]] (or "target ranges") are between 120 and 360 [[molar concentration|µmol/L]], and aimed to be achieved during at least the first 10 years.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=BkVtT9ZyyJsC&pg=PA255 Chapter 55, page 255] in:{{cite book |author=Behrman, Richard E.; Kliegman, Robert; Nelson, Waldo E.; Karen Marcdante; Jenson, Hal B. |title=Nelson essentials of pediatrics |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-0159-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> When Phe cannot be metabolized by the body, abnormally high levels accumulate in the blood and are toxic to the brain.  When left untreated, complications of PKU include severe mental retardation, brain function abnormalities, microcephaly, mood disorders, irregular motor functioning, and behavioral problems such as [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]].  

All PKU patients must adhere to a special diet low in Phe for optimal brain development. "Diet for life" has become the standard recommended by most experts. The diet requires severely restricting or eliminating foods high in Phe, such as [[meat]], [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[fish as food|fish]], [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, [[cheese]], [[legume]]s, [[milk]] and other dairy products. Starchy foods, such as [[potato]]es, [[bread]], [[pasta]], and [[maize|corn]], must be monitored. Infants may still be breastfed to provide all of the benefits of breastmilk, but the quantity must also be monitored and supplementation for missing nutrients will be required.  The sweetener [[aspartame]], present in many diet foods and soft drinks, must also be avoided, as aspartame contains phenylalanine. 

Supplementary infant formulas are used in these patients to provide the amino acids and other necessary nutrients that would otherwise be lacking in a low-phenylalanine diet. As the child grows up these can be replaced with pills, formulas, and specially formulated foods. (Since Phe is necessary for the synthesis of many proteins, it is required for appropriate growth, but levels must be strictly controlled in PKU patients.) In addition, tyrosine, which is normally derived from phenylalanine, must be supplemented.  

The oral administration of [[tetrahydrobiopterin]] (or BH4) (a cofactor for the [[oxidation]] of phenylalanine) can reduce [[blood]] levels of this amino acid in certain patients.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v7/n3/full/nrd2540.html | title = Fresh from the Pipeline: Sapropterin | volume = 7 | pages = 199–200 | last = Burton | first = BK | coauthors = Kar S, Kirkpatrick P | journal = Nature Reviews Drug Discovery | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1038/nrd2540 | issue=3}}</ref><ref name="pmid18230057">{{cite journal |author=Michals-Matalon K |title=Sapropterin dihydrochloride, 6-R-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin, in the treatment of phenylketonuria |journal=Expert Opin Investig Drugs |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=245–251 |year=2008 |pmid=18230057 |doi=10.1517/13543784.17.2.245}}</ref>  The company [[BioMarin Pharmaceutical]] has produced a tablet preparation of the compound sapropterin dihydrochloride (Kuvan), which is a form of tetrahydrobiopterin.

Several other therapies are currently under investigation, including [[gene therapy]], large neutral amino acids, and enzyme substitution therapy with phenylalanine ammonia lyase  (PAL). In the past, PKU-affected people were allowed to go off diet after approximately eight, then 18 years of age. Today, most physicians recommend PKU patients must manage their Phe levels throughout life.

==Maternal phenylketonuria==
[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|250px|Phenylketonuria is inherited in an [[Dominance (genetics)|autosomal recessive]] fashion]]
For women with phenylketonuria, it is essential for the health of their children to maintain low Phe levels before and during pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Lee, P.J., Ridout, D., Walker, J.H., Cockburn, F., | title=Maternal phenylketonuria: report from the United Kingdom Registry 1978–97 | journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume=90 | pages=143–146 | year=2005 | pmid=15665165 | doi = 10.1136/adc.2003.037762 | issue=2 | pmc=1720245}}</ref> Though the developing fetus may only be a carrier of the PKU gene, the intrauterine environment can have very high levels of phenylalanine, which can cross the placenta.

In most countries, women with PKU who wish to have children are advised to lower their blood Phe levels (typically to between 2 and 6 micromol/deciliter) before they become pregnant, and carefully control their levels throughout the pregnancy. This is achieved by performing regular blood tests and adhering very strictly to a diet, in general monitored on a day-to-day basis by a specialist metabolic dietitian. In many cases, as the fetus' liver begins to develop and produce PAH normally, the mother's blood Phe levels will drop, requiring an increased intake to remain within the safe range of 2-6 micromol/dL. The mother's daily Phe intake may double or even triple by the end of the pregnancy, as a result. When maternal blood Phe levels fall below 2 micromol/dL, anecdotal reports indicate that the mothers may suffer adverse effects, including headaches, nausea, hair loss, and general malaise. When low phenylalanine levels are maintained for the duration of pregnancy, there are no elevated levels of risk of birth defects compared with a baby born to a non-PKU mother.<ref name="web">[http://www.medschool.lsuhsc.edu/genetics_center/louisiana/article_pregnancy_PKU.htm lsuhsc.edu] Genetics and Louisiana Families</ref>
Babies with PKU may drink breast milk, while also taking their special metabolic formula. Some research has indicated an exclusive diet of breast milk for PKU babies may alter the effects of the deficiency, though during breastfeeding the mother must maintain a strict diet to keep her Phe levels low. More research is needed. US scientist announced in June 2010 that they would be conducting a thorough investigation on the mutation of genes in the human genome. Their top priority is PKU, as it has become increasingly common, and sufferers often bear children who will be carriers of the recessive gene, and may themselves live past the age of sixty.

==Incidence==

United States Caucasians are affected at a rate of 1 in 10,000.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bickel, H.;, Bachmann, C.; Beckers, R.; Brandt, N.J.; Clayton, B.E.; Corrado, G; et al.| title= Neonatal mass screening for metabolic disorders: summary of recent sessions of the committee of experts to study inborn metabolic diseases| journal= public health committee, Eur.
