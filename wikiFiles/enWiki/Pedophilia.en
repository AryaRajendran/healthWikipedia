As a medical diagnosis, '''pedophilia''' or '''paedophilia''' is a [[mental disorder|psychiatric disorder]] in persons 16 years of age or older typically characterized by a primary or exclusive [[sexual interest]] toward prepubescent children (generally age 11 years or younger, though specific diagnosis criteria for the disorder extends the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13).<ref name="dsm4">{{Cite book| publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. | authorlink = http://www.psych.org|title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV TR (Text Revision) | url = http://www.psychiatryonline.com/resourceTOC.aspx?resourceID=1 | date = 2000-06 | location = Arlington, VA, USA| isbn = 978-0-89042-024-9 | doi = 10.1176/appi.books.9780890423349 | page = 943 }}</ref><ref name=ICD-10>See section F65.4 Paedophilia. {{Cite web |title=The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders Diagnostic criteria for research World|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]/[[ICD-10]]|year=1993|accessdate=2012-10-10|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/GRNBOOK.pdf|quote=B.

===Disease models===
The term '''''paedophilia erotica''''' was coined in 1886 by the [[Vienna|Viennese]] psychiatrist [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] in his writing ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]''.<ref name=Krafft-Ebing>{{Cite book| last1 = Von Krafft-Ebing | first1 = Richard |others= Translated to English by Francis Joseph Rebman| title = Psychopathia Sexualis | year = 1922 | publisher = Medical Art Agency | location = | pages = 552–560| isbn = 1-871592-55-0 }}</ref> The term appears in a section titled "Violation of Individuals Under the Age of Fourteen", which focuses on the [[forensic psychiatry]] aspect of [[Child sexual abuse#Offenders|child sexual offenders]] in general.  Krafft-Ebing describes several typologies of offender, dividing them into [[psychopathology|psychopathological]] and non-psychopathological origins, and hypothesizes several apparent causal factors that may lead to the sexual abuse of children.<ref name=Krafft-Ebing/>

Krafft-Ebing mentioned ''paedophilia erotica'' in a typology of "psycho-sexual perversion". He wrote that he had only encountered it four times in his career and gave brief descriptions of each case, listing three common traits:
# The individual is tainted [by heredity] (''hereditär belastate'')<ref name="Roudinesco">Roudinesco, Élisabeth (2009). ''Our dark side: a history of perversion,'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=W3ejX6C_qfwC&pg=PA144#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 144.] Polity, ISBN 978-0-7456-4593-3</ref>
# The subject's primary attraction is to children, rather than adults.
# The acts committed by the subject are typically not intercourse, but rather involve inappropriate touching or manipulating the child into performing an act on the subject.

He mentions several cases of pedophilia among adult women (provided by another physician), and also considered the abuse of boys by homosexual men to be extremely rare.<ref name=Krafft-Ebing/> Further clarifying this point, he indicated that cases of adult men who have some medical or [[neurology|neurological]] disorder and abuse a male child are not true pedophilia, and that in his observation victims of such men tended to be older and pubescent.  He also lists "Pseudopaedophilia" as a related condition wherein "individuals who have lost [[libido]] for the adult through masturbation and subsequently turn to children for the gratification of their sexual appetite" and claimed this is much more common.<ref name=Krafft-Ebing/>

Austrian neurologist [[Sigmund Freud]] briefly wrote about the topic in his 1905 book ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'' in section entitled "The Sexually immature and Animals as Sexual objects". He wrote that exclusive pedophilia was rare and only occasionally were prepubescent children exclusive objects. He wrote that they usually were the subject of desire when a weak person "makes use of such substitutes" or when an uncontrollable instinct which will not allow delay seeks immediate gratification and cannot find a more appropriate object.<ref>Freud, Sigmund Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex Mobi Classics pages 18-20</ref>

In 1908, [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[neuroanatomy|neuroanatomist]] and psychiatrist [[Auguste Forel]] wrote of the phenomenon, proposing that it be referred to it as "Pederosis", the "Sexual Appetite for Children".  Similar to Krafft-Ebing's work, Forel made the distinction between incidental sexual abuse by persons with [[dementia]] and other organic brain conditions, and the truly preferential and sometimes exclusive sexual desire for children.  However, he disagreed with Krafft-Ebing in that he felt the condition of the latter was largely ingrained and unchangeable.<ref name=Forel>{{Cite book| last1 = Forel  |  first1 = Auguste |others= Translated to English by C.F.

The term "pedophilia" became the generally accepted term for the condition and saw widespread adoption in the early 20th century, appearing in many popular [[Medical dictionary|medical dictionaries]] such as the 5th Edition of ''Stedman's'' in 1918. In 1952, it was included in the first edition of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic  and statistical manual of mental disorders |author=  American Psychiatric Association Committee on Nomenclature and  Statistics |year=1952 |edition= 1st|publisher=The Association |location=Washington,  D.C |page=39 }}</ref> This edition and the subsequent DSM-II listed the disorder as one subtype of the classification "Sexual Deviation", but no diagnostic criteria were provided.

===Diagnostic criteria===

====ICD-10 and DSM====
The ''[[ICD-10]]'' defines pedophilia as "a sexual preference for children, boys or girls or both, usually of prepubertal or early pubertal age".<ref name="WHOPaedophilia"/> Under this system's criteria, a person 16 years of age or older meets the definition if they have a persistent or predominant sexual preference for prepubescent children at least five years younger than them.<ref name=ICD-10/>

The ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' 4th edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) outlines specific criteria for use in the diagnosis of this disorder. These include the presence of sexually arousing fantasies, behaviors or urges that involve some kind of sexual activity with a prepubescent child (generally age 11 years or younger, though the diagnosis criteria for the disorder extends the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13) for six months or more, or that the subject has acted on these urges or suffers from distress as a result of having these feelings. The criteria also indicate that the subject should be 16 or older and that the child or children they fantasize about are at least five years younger than them, though ongoing sexual relationships between a 12–13 year old and a late adolescent are advised to be excluded.  A diagnosis is further specified by the sex of the children the person is attracted to, if the impulses or acts are limited to [[incest]], and if the attraction is "exclusive" or "nonexclusive".<ref name="dsm4"/>

Many terms have been used to distinguish "true pedophiles" from non-pedophilic and non-exclusive offenders, or to distinguish among types of offenders on a continuum according to strength and exclusivity of pedophilic interest, and motivation for the offense (see [[Child sexual abuse#Offenders|child sexual offender types]]). Exclusive pedophiles are sometimes referred to as "true pedophiles". They are attracted to prepubescent children, and prepubescent children only. They show no erotic interest in adults their own age and can only become aroused while fantasizing about or being in the presence of prepubescent children, or both.<ref name=psychiatrictimes.com/> Non-exclusive offenders—or "non-exclusive pedophiles"—may at times be referred to as non-pedophilic offenders, but the two terms are not always synonymous. Non-exclusive offenders are attracted to both children and adults, and can be sexually aroused by both, though a sexual preference for one over the other in this case may also exist. If a preference for prepubescent children, such offenders are considered pedophiles in the same vein as exclusive offenders.<ref name="WHOPaedophilia"/><ref name=psychiatrictimes.com/>

Neither the ICD nor the DSM diagnostic criteria require actual sexual activity with a prepubescent youth. The diagnosis can therefore be made based on the presence of ''fantasies'' or ''sexual urges'' even if they have never been acted upon. On the other hand, a person who acts upon these urges yet experiences no distress about their fantasies or urges can also qualify for the diagnosis. ''Acting'' on sexual urges is not limited to overt sex acts for purposes of this diagnosis, and can sometimes include [[indecent exposure]], [[voyeurism|voyeuristic]] or [[frotteurism|frotteuristic]] behaviors,<ref name="dsm4"/> or masturbating to [[child pornography]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Seto MC, Cantor JM, Blanchard R |title=Child pornography offenses are a valid diagnostic indicator of pedophilia |journal=J Abnorm Psychol |volume=115 |issue=3 |pages=610–5 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16866601 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.115.3.610 |quote=The results suggest child pornography offending is a stronger diagnostic indicator of pedophilia than is sexually offending against child victims}}</ref> Often, these behaviors need to be considered in-context with an element of clinical judgment before a diagnosis is made. Likewise, when the patient is in late adolescence, the age difference is not specified in hard numbers and instead requires careful consideration of the situation.<ref name=DSMmedem>[http://www.medem.com/MedLB/article_detaillb.cfm?article_ID=ZZZUZRUZGLC&sub_cat=355 ''Pedophilia''] DSM at the Medem Online Medical Library</ref>

[[Ego-dystonic sexual orientation]] ({{ICD10|F|66|1|f|60}}) includes people who acknowledge that they have a sexual preference for prepubertal children, but wish to change it due to the associated psychological or behavioral problems (or both).

====Debate regarding the DSM criteria====
The DSM IV criteria have been criticized simultaneously for being over-inclusive, as well as under-inclusive.<ref name=Studer>{{cite journal | author = Studer Lea H., Aylwin A.

[[Ray Blanchard]], an [[Canadians of American origin|American-Canadian]] [[Sexology|sexologist]] known for his research studies on pedophilia, noted in his literature review for the [[DSM-5]] the objections and proposed a general solution applicable to all paraphilias. Namely, a distinction between ''paraphilia'' and ''paraphilic disorder''. The latter term is proposed to identify the [[mental disorder|diagnosable condition]] which meets both Criterion A and B, whereas an individual who does not meet Criterion B can be ascertained but ''not'' diagnosed as having a paraphilia.<ref>[http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Sex%20and%20GID%20Lit%20Reviews/Paraphilias/DSMV.PEDO.pdf The DSM Diagnostic Criteria for Pedophilia]</ref> Blanchard and a number of his colleagues also proposed that hebephilia become a diagnosable mental disorder under the DSM V to resolve the physical development overlap between pedophilia and hebephilia by combining the categories under ''Pedophilic Disorder'', but with specifiers on which age range (or both) is the primary interest.<ref name="dsm5.org"/><ref name=Blanchard>{{cite doi|10.1007/s10508-008-9399-9}}</ref> This proposal was rejected by the [[American Psychiatric Association]].<ref name=prnsdhebephilia>{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/witness/201212/psychiatry-rejects-novel-sexual-disorder-hebephilia |title=Psychiatry Rejects Novel Sexual Disorder "Hebephilia" |author=Karen Franklin |authorlink=Karen Franklin |date=2 December 2012 |publisher=Psychology Today |location=USA }}</ref> If hebephilia had been accepted as a DSM V diagnosable disorder, it would have been similar to the [[ICD-10]] definition of pedophilia that already includes early pubescents,<ref name=SetoReview/> and would have raised the minimum age required for a person to be able to be diagnosed with pedophilia from 16 years to 18 years (with the individual needing to be at least 5 years older than the minor).<ref name="dsm5.org"/>

O'Donohue, however, took the issue in a different direction, suggesting instead that the diagnostic criteria be simplified to the attraction to children alone if ascertained by self-report, laboratory findings, or past behavior. He states that any sexual attraction to children is pathological and that distress is irrelevant, noting "this sexual attraction has the potential to cause significant harm to others and is also not in the best interests of the individual."<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = O'Donohue | first1 = W. | title = A critique of the proposed DSM-V diagnosis of pedophilia | journal = Arch Sex Behav | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 587–90 | month = Jun | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-010-9604-5 | pmid = 20204487 }}</ref> Also arguing for behavioral criteria in defining pedophilia, Howard E.

====Other uses====
In a 1993 review of research on child sexual abuse, Sharon Araji and [[David Finkelhor]] stated that because this field of research was underdeveloped at that time, there are "definitional problems" resulting from lack of standardization among researchers in their use of the term "pedophilia". They described two definitions, a "restrictive" form referring to individuals with strong and exclusive sexual interest in children, and an "inclusive" definition, expanding the term to include offenders who engaged in sexual contact with a child, including incest. They stated that they used the wider definition in their review paper because behavioral criteria are easier to identify and do not require complex analysis of an individual's motivations.<ref name= Finkelhor/>

==Development and sexual orientation==
Pedophilia can be described as a disorder of sexual preference, phenomenologically similar to a [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or homosexual [[sexual orientation]] because it emerges before or during puberty, and because it is stable over time.<ref>Brian L. Cutler, ''Encyclopedia of Psychology and Law'', SAGE, 2008, ISBN 978-1-4129-5189-0, p. 549</ref> These observations, however, do not exclude pedophilia from the group of mental disorders because pedophilic acts cause harm, and pedophiles can sometimes be helped by mental health professionals to refrain from acting on their impulses.<ref>[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/157/5/838 Treatments to Change Sexual Orientation, Fred S. Berlin]</ref>

==Psychopathology and personality traits==
Several researchers have reported correlations between pedophilia and certain psychological characteristics, such as low [[self-esteem]]<ref>{{cite journal | author = Marshall W.

(2002), studying child sex offenders, states that pedophiles have impaired interpersonal functioning and elevated [[passive-aggressive behavior|passive-aggressiveness]], as well as impaired [[self-concept]]. Regarding disinhibitory traits, pedophiles demonstrate elevated [[psychopathy]] and propensity for cognitive distortions. According to the authors, pathologic personality traits in pedophiles lend support to a hypothesis that such pathology is related to both motivation for and failure to inhibit pedophilic behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Cohen LJ |title=Personality impairment in male pedophiles |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=63 |issue=10 |pages=912–9 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12416601 |doi= 10.4088/JCP.v63n1009|url=http://www.psychiatrist.com/privatepdf/2002/v63n10/v63n1009.pdf|format=PDF|author-separator=,|author2=McGeoch PG|author3=Watras-Gans S|display-authors=3|last4=Acker|first4=Sara|last5=Poznansky|first5=Olga|last6=Cullen|first6=Ken|last7=Itskovich|first7=Yelena|last8=Galynker|first8=Igor}}</ref>

According to Wilson and Cox (1983), "The paedophiles emerge as significantly higher on Psychoticism, Introversion and Neurotocism than age-matched controls. [But] there is a difficulty in untangling cause and effect. We cannot tell whether paedophiles gravitate towards children because, being highly introverted, they find the company of children less threatening than that of adults, or whether the social withdrawal implied by their introversion is a result of the isolation engendered by their preference i.e., awareness of the social approbation and hostility that it evokes" (p.&nbsp;324).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wilson G.

Studying child sex offenders, a review of qualitative research studies published between 1982 and 2001 concluded that pedophiles use [[cognitive distortion]]s to meet personal needs, justifying abuse by making excuses, redefining their actions as love and mutuality, and exploiting the power imbalance inherent in all adult–child relationships.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Isolation, gratification, justification: offenders' explanations of child molesting|author= Lawson L.|journal=Issues Ment Health Nurs|date=2003 September–November;|issue=24|volume=(6-7):|pmid=12907384|pages=695–705}}</ref> Other cognitive distortions include the idea of "children as sexual beings", "uncontrollability of sexuality", and "sexual entitlement-bias".<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Implicit cognitive distortions and sexual offending|author= Mihailides S, Devilly GJ, Ward T.|journal=Sex Abuse|year=2004 | month=October|volume=16|issue=(4):|pmid=15560415|pages=333–50|doi=10.1177/107906320401600406}}</ref>

One review of the literature concludes that research on personality correlates and [[psychopathology]] in pedophiles is rarely methodologically correct, in part owing to confusion between pedophiles and child sex offenders, as well as the difficulty of obtaining a representative, community sample of pedophiles.<ref>Okami, P. & Goldberg, A. (1992). "Personality Correlates of Pedophilia: Are They Reliable Indicators?", ''Journal of Sex Research'', Vol. 29, No. 3, pp. 297–328. "For example, because an unknown percentage of true pedophiles may never act on their impulses or may never be arrested, forensic samples of sex offenders against minors clearly do not represent the population of "pedophiles", and many such persons apparently do not even belong to the population of "pedophiles"."</ref> Seto (2004) points out that pedophiles who are available from a clinical setting are likely there because of distress over their sexual preference or pressure from others. This increases the likelihood that they will show psychological problems. Similarly, pedophiles recruited from a correctional setting have been convicted of a crime, making it more likely that they will show anti-social characteristics.<ref name="seto2004" />

While not causes of pedophilia themselves, [[Child abuse|childhood abuse]] by adults or [[comorbidity|comorbid]] psychiatric illnesses—such as [[personality disorder]]s and [[substance abuse]]—are risk factors for acting on pedophilic urges.<ref name=faganJAMA>{{Cite journal|author=Fagan PJ, Wise TN, Schmidt CW, Berlin FS |title=Pedophilia |journal=JAMA |volume=288 |issue=19 |pages=2458–65 |year=2002 |month=November |pmid=12435259 |doi= 10.1001/jama.288.19.2458 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12435259}}</ref> Blanchard, Cantor, and Robichaud (2006) noted about comorbid psychiatric illnesses that, "The theoretical implications are not so clear.

==Prevalence and child molestation==
The prevalence of pedophilia in the general population is not known,<ref name=SetoReview/><ref name="seto2004">{{Cite journal|author=Seto MC |title=Pedophilia and sexual offenses against children |journal=Annu Rev Sex Res |volume=15 |issue= |pages=321–61 |year=2004 |pmid=16913283 |doi= }}</ref> but is estimated to be lower than 5% among adult men.<ref name=SetoReview/> "Most sexual offenders against children are male, although female offenders may account for 0.4% to 4% of convicted sexual offenders. On the basis of a range of published reports, McConaghy estimates a 10 to 1 ratio of male-to-female child molesters."<ref name=psychiatrictimes.com/> It is believed that the true number of female pedophiles is underrepresented by available estimates, and that reasons for this may include a "societal tendency to dismiss the negative impact of sexual relationships between young boys and adult women, as well as women’s greater access to very young children who cannot report their abuse", among other explanations.<ref name=psychiatrictimes.com/>

The term ''pedophile'' is commonly used to describe all [[child sexual abuse]] offenders, including those who do not meet the clinical diagnosis standards, which is seen as problematic by researchers,<ref name="ames"/><ref name="Edwards"/> as most distinguish between child molesters and pedophiles.<ref name=SetoReview/><ref name=Oxford/><ref name="Edwards"/><ref name=Studer/> A perpetrator of child sexual abuse is commonly assumed to be and referred to as a pedophile; however, there may be other motivations for the crime<ref name="barbaree-seto" /> (such as stress, marital problems, or the unavailability of an adult partner).<ref>Howells, K. (1981). "Adult sexual interest in children: Considerations relevant to theories of aetiology", ''Adult sexual interest in children.'' 55-94.</ref> As child sexual abuse may or may not be an indicator that its perpetrator is a pedophile, offenders may be separated into two types: Exclusive (i.e., "true pedophiles") and non-exclusive (or, in some cases, "non-pedophilic"). According to a U.S. study on 2429 adult male sex offenders who were categorized as "pedophiles", only 7% identified themselves as exclusive; indicating that many or most child sexual abusers may fall into the non-exclusive category.<ref name=mayoclinic/> However, the [[Mayo Clinic]] reports perpetrators who meet the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia offend more often than non-pedophile perpetrators, and with a greater number of victims. They state that approximately 95% of child sexual abuse incidents are committed by the 88% of child molestation offenders who meet the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia.<ref name="mayoclinic"/> A behavioral analysis report by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] states that a "high percentage of acquaintance child molesters are preferential sex offenders who have a true sexual preference for [prepubescent] children (i.e., true pedophiles)".<ref name=lanning3e>{{Cite web|title=Child Molesters: A Behavioral Analysis (Third Edition)|url=http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/publications/NC70.pdf |author=Lanning, Kenneth |year=2001 |publisher=National Center for Missing & Exploited Children |pages=25, 27, 29|format=PDF}}</ref>

A review article in the ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'' notes the overlap between extrafamilial and intrafamilial offenders. One study found that around half of the fathers and stepfathers in its sample who were referred for committing extrafamilial abuse had also been abusing their own children.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cycle of child sexual abuse: links between being a victim and becoming a perpetrator|author=M. GLASSER, FRCPsych and I. KOLVIN, FRCPsych |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/bjprcpsych;179/6/482|work=British Journal of Psychiatry|year=2001}}</ref>

As noted by Abel, Mittleman, and Becker<ref>Abel, G. G., Mittleman, M. S., & Becker, J. V. (1985). "Sex offenders: Results of assessment and recommendations for treatment". In M. H. Ben-Aron, S. J. Hucker, & C. D. Webster (Eds.), ''Clinical criminology: The assessment and treatment of criminal behavior'' (pp. 207–220). Toronto, Canada: M & M Graphics.</ref> (1985) and Ward ''et al.'' (1995), there are generally large distinctions between the two types of offenders' characteristics. Situational offenders tend to offend at times of stress; have a later onset of offending; have fewer, often familial victims; and have a general preference for adult partners. Pedophilic offenders, however, often start offending at an early age; often have a large number of victims who are frequently extrafamilial; are more inwardly driven to offend; and have values or beliefs that strongly support an offense lifestyle. Research suggests that incest offenders recidivate at approximately half the rate of extrafamilial child molesters, and one study estimated that by the time of entry to treatment, nonincestuous pedophiles who molest boys had committed an average of 282 offenses against 150 victims.<ref name=grossman>{{Cite journal|title=Are Sex Offenders Treatable?

Some child molesters—pedophiles or not—threaten their victims to stop them from reporting their actions.<ref name="dsm4"/> Others, like those that often victimize children, can develop complex ways of getting access to children, like gaining the trust of a child's parent, trading children with other pedophiles or, infrequently, get foster children from non-industrialized nations or abduct child victims from strangers.<ref name="dsm4"/> Offending pedophiles may often act interested in the child, to gain the child's interest, loyalty and affection to keep the child from letting others know about the abuse.<ref name="dsm4"/>

==Child pornography==
[[Child pornography]] is commonly collected by pedophiles who use the images for a variety of purposes, ranging from private sexual uses, trading with other pedophiles, preparing children for sexual abuse as part of the [[child grooming]] process, or enticement leading to entrapment for sexual exploitation such as production of new child pornography or [[Prostitution of children|child prostitution]].<ref name=CrossonTower208>{{cite book|title=Understanding child abuse and neglect  |first=Cynthia |last=Crosson-Tower |isbn=0-205-40183-X |publisher=Allyn & Bacon |year=2005|page=208}}</ref><ref name=Wortley14>{{cite journal|title=Child Pornography on the Internet |author=Richard Wortley, Stephen Smallbone |journal=Problem-Oriented Guides for Police |volume=No. 41|pages=p14–16}}</ref><ref name= Levesque64>{{cite book |title=Sexual Abuse of Children: A Human Rights Perspective |first=Roger J.

Pedophile viewers of child pornography are often obsessive about collecting, organizing, categorizing, and labeling their child pornography collection according to age, gender, sex act and fantasy.<ref name=CrossonTower200>{{cite book|title=Understanding child abuse and neglect |first=Cynthia |last=Crosson-Tower |isbn=0-205-40183-X |publisher=Allyn & Bacon |year=2005|pages=198–200}}</ref><ref name= Lanning/> According to FBI agent Ken Lanning,  "collecting" pornography does not mean that they merely view pornography, but that they save it, and "it comes to define, fuel, and validate their most cherished sexual fantasies". An extensive collection indicates a strong sexual preference for children and the owned collection is the single best indicator of what he or she wants to do.<ref name= Lanning>{{cite journal|title=Child Molesters: A Behavioral Analysis 4th ed|first=Kenneth V. |last=Lanning |year=2001 |publisher=National Center for Missing and Exploited Children|volume=86}}</ref>  Researchers Taylor and Quayle reported that pedophile collectors of child pornography are often involved in anonymous internet communities dedicated to extending their collections.<ref name= NSPCC>{{cite web|title=Child pornography: images of the abuse of children|year=2003 |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/research/Briefings/imagesofchildabuse_wda48219.html|publisher=National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children}}</ref> Pedophile online community bulletin boards (such as the defunct Dreamboard, taken down in [[Operation Delego]]), often include technical advice regarding [[encryption]] and other measures from experienced child pornographers to assist new perpetrators from detection from [[law enforcement]].<ref name= Lanning/>

==Causes and biological associations==
Although what causes pedophilia is not yet known, beginning in 2002, researchers began reporting a series of findings [[association (statistics)|linking]] pedophilia with brain structure and function: Pedophilic men have lower [[Intelligence quotient|IQs]],<ref name=Blanchard2007>{{cite journal | author = Blanchard R., Kolla N.

Another study, using structural [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], shows that male pedophiles have a lower volume of [[white matter]] than a [[Scientific control|control group]].<ref name = Cantor2008/>

Functional magnetic resonance imaging ([[fMRI]]) has shown that child molesters diagnosed with pedophilia have reduced activation of the [[hypothalamus]] as compared with non-pedophilic persons when viewing sexually arousing pictures of adults.<ref>Walter ''et al.'' (2007). "Pedophilia Is Linked to Reduced Activation in Hypothalamus and Lateral Prefrontal Cortex During Visual Erotic Stimulation". ''Biological Psychiatry.'' '''62'''.</ref>  A 2008 functional [[neuroimaging]] study notes that central processing of sexual stimuli in heterosexual "paedophile forensic inpatients" may be altered by a disturbance in the prefrontal networks, which "may be associated with stimulus-controlled behaviours, such as sexual compulsive behaviours".

Blanchard, Cantor, and Robichaud (2006) reviewed the research that attempted to identify [[hormone|hormonal]] aspects of pedophiles.<ref name = Blanchard2006>Blanchard, R., Cantor, J.

New York: Guilford.</ref> They concluded that there is some evidence that pedophilic men have less [[testosterone]] than controls, but that the research is of poor quality and that it is difficult to draw any firm conclusion from it.

A study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 heterosexual men by using the Wilson Sex Fantasy Questionnaire exam determined that males with a pronounced degree of [[Paraphilia|paraphilic]] interest (including pedophilia) had a greater number of older brothers, a high 2D:4D [[digit ratio]] (which would indicate excessive prenatal estrogen exposure), and an elevated probability of being [[Left-handedness|left-handed]], suggesting that disturbed hemispheric [[Lateralization of brain function|brain lateralization]] may play a role in deviant attractions.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/s10508-007-9255-3}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Although pedophilia has yet no cure, various treatments are available that are aimed at reducing or preventing the expression of pedophilic behavior, reducing the prevalence of child sexual abuse.<ref name=fullerJAMA>{{Cite journal|author=Fuller AK |title=Child molestation and pedophilia. An overview for the physician |journal=JAMA |volume=261 |issue=4 |pages=602–6 |year=1989 |month=January |pmid=2642565 |doi=10.1001/jama.261.4.602}}</ref><ref>[http://www.atsa.com/ppOffenderFacts.html Public Policy]</ref> Treatment of pedophilia often requires collaboration between law enforcement and health care professionals.<ref name=faganJAMA/><ref name=fullerJAMA/> A number of proposed treatment techniques for pedophilia have been developed, though the success rate of these therapies has been very low.<ref name="crawfordd">Crawford, David (1981). "Treatment approaches with pedophiles". ''Adult sexual interest in children''. 181–217.</ref>

===Cognitive behavioral therapy===
[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]], also known as relapse prevention, has been shown to reduce recidivism in contact sex offenders.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Marshall W.L., Jones R., Ward T., Johnston P., Bambaree H.E. | year = 1991 | title = Treatment of sex offenders | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 465–485 | doi = 10.1016/0272-7358(91)90119-F }}</ref>

According to Canadian [[sexology|sexologist]] [[Michael C. Seto]], cognitive-behavioral treatments target attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that are believed to increase the likelihood of sexual offenses against children, and "relapse prevention" is the most common type of cognitive behavioral treatment.<ref name = Seto2008>Seto, M. C. (2008). ''Pedophilia and sexual offending against children: Theory, assessment, and intervention.'' Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association.</ref> The techniques of relapse prevention are based on principles used for treating addictions.<ref name="pn.psychiatryonline.org">[http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/41/10/37 Pedophilia Often in Headlines, But Not in Research Labs — Psychiatric News]</ref> Other scientists have also done some research that indicates that recidivism rates of pedophiles in therapy are lower than pedophiles who eschew therapy.<ref name="pn.psychiatryonline.org"/>

===Behavioral interventions===
Behavioral treatments target sexual arousal to children, using satiation and aversion techniques to suppress sexual arousal to children and [[covert sensitization]] (or [[masturbation|masturbatory]] reconditioning) to increase sexual arousal to adults.<ref name = Seto2008/> Behavioral treatments appear to have an effect on sexual arousal patterns on phallometric testing, but it is not known whether the test changes represent changes in sexual interests or changes in the ability to control genital arousal during testing.<ref>Barbaree, H. E., Bogaert, A. F., & Seto, M. C. (1995). Sexual reorientation therapy for pedophiles: Practices and controversies. In L. Diamant & R. D.

New York: Guildford Press.</ref> For sex offenders with mental disabilities, [[applied behavior analysis]] has been used.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Maguth Nezu C., Fiore A. A., Nezu A. M | year = 2006 | title = Problem Solving Treatment for Intellectually Disabled Sex Offenders | url = | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 266–275 }}</ref>

===Pharmacological interventions===
Medications are used to lower sex drive in pedophiles by interfering with the activity of testosterone, such as with [[Depo-Provera]] (medroxyprogesterone acetate), Androcur (cyproterone acetate), and Lupron (leuprolide acetate).

[[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue]]s, which last longer and have fewer side-effects, are also effective in reducing libido and may be used.<ref>Cohen, L. J. & Galynker, I. I. (2002). Clinical features of pedophilia and implications for treatment. Journal of Psychiatric Practice, 8, 276-289.</ref>

These treatments, commonly referred to as "[[chemical castration]]", are often used in conjunction with the non-medical approaches noted above. According the [[Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers]], "Anti-androgen treatment should be coupled with appropriate monitoring and counseling within a comprehensive treatment plan."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ant-androgen therapy and surgical castration|work=Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers|url=http://www.atsa.com/ppantiandro.html|year=1997}}</ref>

===Limitations of treatment===
Although these results are relevant to the prevention of reoffending in contact child sex offenders, there is no [[empiricism|empirical]] suggestion that such therapy is a cure for pedophilia. Dr. [[Fred Berlin]], founder of the [[Johns Hopkins]] Sexual Disorders Clinic, believes that pedophilia could be successfully treated if the medical community would give it more attention.<ref name="berlin">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.paraphilias.com/publications/pdfs/Peer%20Comment.pdf|title=Peer Commentaries on Green (2002) and Schmidt (2002) - Pedophilia: When Is a Difference a Disorder?|first==Fred S. |last=Berlin, M.D., Ph.D.|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=31|issue=6|month=December | year=2002|pages=479–480|doi=10.1023/A:1020603214218|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-12-17}}</ref>  Castration, either physical or chemical, appears to be highly effective in removing such sexual impulses when offending is driven by the libido, but this method is not recommended when the drive is an expression of anger or the need for power and  control (e.g., violent/[[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] offenders).<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/04/AR2006070400960_pf.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Can Castration Be a Solution for Sex Offenders? | first=Candace | last=Rondeaux | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>  Chemical and surgical castration has been used in several European countries since [[World War II]], although not to the extent it was employed in [[Nazi Germany]].  The program in [[Hamburg]] was terminated after 2000, while [[Poland]] is now seeking to introduce chemical castration.<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3669718,00.html DW-world.de]</ref>  The Council of Europe works to bring the practice to an end in Eastern European countries where it is still applied through the courts.<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4004260,00.html DW-world.de]</ref>

==In law and forensic psychology==

===Definitions===
In law enforcement circles, the term ''pedophile'' is sometimes used in a broad manner to encompass a person who commits one or more sexually-based crimes that relate to [[age of consent|legally underage]] victims.  These crimes may include [[child sexual abuse]], [[statutory rape]], offenses involving [[child pornography]], [[child grooming]], [[stalking]], and [[indecent exposure]].  One unit of the United Kingdom's [[Child Abuse Investigation Command]] is known as the "Paedophile Unit" and specializes in online investigations and enforcement work.<ref>{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Metropolitan Police Service - SCD - Child Abuse Investigation Command | url = http://www.met.police.uk/scd/specialist_units/child_abuse.htm | publisher =  | date = | accessdate = 12 October 2010 }}</ref>  Some forensic science texts, such as Holmes (2008) use the term to refer to a class of psychological offender typologies that target child victims, even when such children are not the primary sexual interest of the offender.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Holmes | first1 = Ronald M. | title = Profiling Violent Crimes: An Investigative Tool | date =  | publisher = Sage Pubns| location =  | isbn = 1-4129-5998-5 | pages =  }}</ref> The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], however, makes a point of acknowledging preferential sex offenders who have a true sexual preference for prepubescent children.<ref name=lanning3e/>

===Civil and legal commitment===
{{Globalize-USA|section|date=March 2012}}<!--India, Thailand, Philippines, Brazil, etc-->

In the United States, following ''[[Kansas v. Hendricks]]'', sex offenders that can be diagnosed with certain mental disorders, including pedophilia, can be subject to indefinite [[civil commitment]].<ref name=cp>http://www.courtpsychiatrist.com/pdf/pharmacological%20treatment%20sex%20offenders.pdf</ref> In ''Kansas v. Hendricks'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] upheld as constitutional a Kansas law, the [[Sexually Violent Predator Act]] (SVPA), under which Hendricks, a pedophile, was found to have a "mental abnormality" defined as a "congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity which predisposes the person to commit sexually violent offenses to the degree that such person is a menace to the health and safety of others", which allowed the State to [[Civil confinement|confine]] Hendricks indefinitely irrespective of whether the State provided any treatment to Hendricks.<ref name=guilford>{{cite web

==Societal views==

===General===
Pedophilia and child sexual abuse are generally seen as morally wrong and abnormal by society.<ref name="Books.google.com">{{cite book | author =Christian Smith| title =What Is a Person?: Rethinking Humanity, Social Life, and the Moral Good from the Person Up |publisher= University of Chicago Press|year=2010|pages=544 pages |accessdate=2010-10-15|isbn =0-226-76591-1, 9780226765914 | url =http://books.google.com/?id=sT9r_h8X8I4C&pg=PA419&dq=Pedophilia+morally+wrong#v=onepage&q=Pedophilia%20morally%20wrong&f=false}}</ref><ref name="books.google.com">"Pedophilia is one sexual disorder that is widely looked upon as legally, socially, and morally wrong." {{cite book | author = Eric W.

===Misuse of medical terminology===
The words ''pedophile'' and ''pedophilia'' are sometimes used informally to describe an adult's sexual interest or attraction to pubescent or post-pubescent teenagers and to other situations that do not fit within the clinical definitions. The terms ''[[hebephilia]]'' or ''[[ephebophilia]]'' may be more accurate in these cases.<ref name=britannica/><ref name=mayoclinic/><ref name="www.usccb.org"/> This was especially seen in the case of [[Mark Foley]] during the [[Mark Foley congressional page incident|congressional page incident]]. Most of the media labeled Foley a pedophile, which led David Tuller of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine to state that Foley was not a pedophile but rather an ephebophile.<ref name="www.slate.com">{{cite news|first=David |last=Tuller|title=What To Call Foley.

Another common usage of ''pedophilia'' is to refer to the [[actus reus]] itself (that is, interchangeably with "sexual abuse")<ref name=britannica>{{Cite web|title=pedophilia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9058932 |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}</ref><ref name="psychtoday"/><ref name="burgess"/><ref name=americanheritage2>{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pedophilia  |title="pedophilia" (n.d.) |work=The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary |date=May 6, 2008|quote=The act or fantasy on the part of an adult of engaging in sexual activity with a child or children.}}</ref> rather than the medical meaning, which is a ''preference'' for that age group on the part of the older individual.<ref name="ames" /><ref name=lanning3e/> There are also situations where the terms are misused to refer to relationships where the younger person is an adult of legal age, but is either perceived socially as being too young in comparison to their older partner, or the older partner occupies a position of authority over them.<ref name="www.huffingtonpost.com">{{Cite news| last  =  Guzzardi| first =  Will| title = Andy Martin, GOP Senate Candidate, Calls  Opponent Mark Kirk A "De Facto Pedophile" | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/06/andy-martin-gop-senate-ca_n_413624.html  | publisher =  | date =  2010-01-06| accessdate = 15 January 2010 | work=Huffington Post}}</ref><ref>Seligman, M.
