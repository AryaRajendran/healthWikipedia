'''Belsazar de la Motte Hacquet''', (also '''Balthasar or Balthazar Hacquet''') (c. 1735 – January 10, 1815) was an [[Austria]]n physician of [[French people|French]] descent in the [[Enlightenment Era]]. He was a [[war surgeon]], a physician in the mining town of [[Idrija]], and a professor of [[anatomy]] and [[surgery]] in [[Ljubljana|Laibach]] (now Ljubljana). He researched the geology and botany of [[Carniola]], [[Istria]], and nearby places, and was the first explorer of the [[Julian Alps]]. He also did [[ethnography|ethnographical]] work among the [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] peoples, particularly among the [[Slovene language|Slovene]]-speaking population. He self-identified primarily as a [[chemist]] and introduced the methods of [[chemical analysis]] to Carniola.

Hacquet was mysterious about the time and place of his birth and the two have remained uncertain, although sources agree that he was an [[illegitimate child]]. Most sources have cited the information from his autobiography that he was born in 1739 or 1740 in [[Le Conquet]], [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]] to an aristocratic father. When he lived in Ljubljana, he told [[Sigmund Zois]] that he was born to a Russian grandee, but this has not been supported by any sources. In 1821, the German lexicon ''Das Gelehrte Teutschland'' mentioned that he had been born in [[Metz]], [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]. A 2003 investigation in the town archives in Metz has given further credence to the claim that Hacquet had been born in this town or its vicinity. The author hypothesised that Balthasar Hacquet was a son of a poor mother and an unknown father, baptised on 11 August 1736 as Jean. However, the question remains unsettled pending further research.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.sistory.si/?urn=SISTORY:ID:5292 |title=K vprašanju izvora Balthasarja Hacqueta |language=Slovene, with a French resume |first=Janez |last=Šumrada |year=2003 |volume=57 |issue=3–4 |publisher=Association of Slovenian Historical Societies |journal=Zgodovinski časopis |issn=0350-5774}}</ref>

Hacquet studied in [[Vienna]], and was a [[surgeon]] during the [[Seven Years' War]]. Later he was an instructor of [[anatomy]] and [[natural sciences]] in Laibach, and in 1788 was a professor at the [[Lviv University|University of Lemberg]] (Lviv). After 1810 he lived in Vienna.

Hacquet is remembered for his scientific journeys throughout the [[Austrian Empire]]. He was a [[polymath]], and performed research in the fields of [[geology]], [[mineralogy]], [[botany]], [[chemistry]], [[ethnography]], [[petrology]] and [[karstology]]. He is recognized as the first scientist to perform extensive exploration of the [[Julian Alps]]. In 1777 he was the first to try to ascend to the top of [[Triglav]] (2864 m), the highest peak in Slovenia, and reached [[Mali Triglav]] (2725 m). In 1789 he published a description of the 1786 [[debris flow]] at the [[Salt Mud Slide]].<ref>[http://www.sloged.si/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=8Rf%2FwkwMfYw%3D&tabid=143 Benko, Igor. 2011.

He met with Dolomieu in Laibach in 1784.<ref name="Kranjc">{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-XBSU59HS/?&language=eng |title=Balthasar Hacquet (1739/40-1815), the Pionneer of Karst Geomorphologists |first=Andrej |last=Kranjc |journal=Acta Carsologica |volume=35 |issue=2 |year=2006 |issn=0583-6050 |publisher=Institute for the Karst Research, Scientific Research Centre, Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-XYWN659P/?&language=eng |title=Žiga Zois in Déodat de Dolomieu |language=Slovene, with an English abstract |first=Janez |last=Šumrada |issn=0023-4923 |journal=Kronika: časopis za slovensko krajevno zgodovino [The Chronicle: the Newspaper for the Slovenian History of Places] |publisher=Association of Slovenian Historical Societies, Section for the History of Places |volume=49 |issue=1/2 |year=2001 |pages=65–72}}</ref>

Among Hacquet's written works is the four-volume ''[[Oryctographia Carniolica]]'', which included a geological and mineralogical study of [[Carniola]], [[Istria]], and surrounding districts. In this work, published in [[Leipzig]] in 1778 and 1789, he provided an in-depth report of the [[Idrija mercury mine]], where he get employed at 26 years of age and worked for some time with [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]]. He was also the author of an [[ethnography|ethnographical]] study of Southern Slavic peoples called ''Slavus Venedus Illyricus''. From 1771 to 1780, he was the secretary of the [[Carniolan Agricultural Society]], members of which were also other prominent members of the Enlightenment, such as [[Sigmund Zois]], [[Blaž Kumerdej]],  [[Gabriel Gruber]], [[Peter Pavel Glavar]], and [[Anton Tomaž Linhart]].

As a botanist Hacquet wrote a book on [[alpine flora]] from Carniola called ''[[Plantae alpinae Carniolicae]]''. The botanical genus ''[[Hacquetia epipactis]]'' is named after him, as well as the plant species ''[[Pedicularis hacquetii]]'' (Hacquet's [[lousewort]]). On one of his excursions, he discovered "on the evening, Trenta side of Triglav, a new species of scabious" and picked it for his [[herbarium]] collection, nowadays preserved in the [[Natural History Museum of Slovenia]]. He called the species ''[[Scabiosa trenta]]'' in the published description, and drew it. Many botanists have sought the mysterious pale yellow [[scabious]], among them also the young [[Julius Kugy]]. He searched for the secretive flower, and though he was not able to find it, this led him to became a great explorer and describer of the Julian Alps. The Austrian botanist, [[A. Kerner]], later proved Belsazar Hacquet had not found a new species, but a specimen of the already known submediterranean ''[[Cephalaria leucantha]]''.

==Commemoration==
A memorial relief to Belsazar Hacquet was erected in 1987 in Ljubljana at [[Upper Square, Ljubljana|Upper Square]] ({{lang-sl|Gornji trg}}) on the facade of the house No. 4, where he lived from 1766 to 1787. The relief is work of the sculptor Albin Ambrožič.
