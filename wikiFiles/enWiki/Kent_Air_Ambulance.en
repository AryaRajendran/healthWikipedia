The '''Kent Air Ambulance''' is an organisation providing [[emergency medical services]] through the provision of a [[helicopter]] [[air ambulance]] covering the county of [[Kent]] in the South East of England, United Kingdom.  The helicopter is funded by the '''Kent Air Ambulance Trust''' (under the operating name of the ''Kent Air Ambulance Fund''), which is a [[charitable organization|registered charity]], raising money from public and private donations in excess of £4m every year between Kent, [[Sussex]] and [[Surrey]].<ref name="Ref_">{{EW charity|1021367|Kent Air Ambulance Trust}}</ref><ref name=who>{{cite web|publisher=Kent Air Ambulance Trust|title=Who we are|url=http://www.kentairambulance.co.uk/who_we_are}}</ref>

==Overview and history==
The service is operated by the Kent Air Ambulance Trust, a [[registered charity]] established in 1989. The trust was founded by Kate Chivers (in whose honour the current helicopter is named),<ref name=kentonline>{{cite news|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kentonline/newsarchive.aspx?articleid=34777|title=Naming of air ambulance a tribute to Kate|publisher=Kent Messenger|last=Sturgess|first=Trevor|date=2007-09-25}}</ref> and was originally called the South East Thames Air Ambulance.<ref name="Ref_2007">{{cite news|work=BBC News | date=2007-09-24|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7011136.stm|title=Air ambulance founder in honoured | accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref>  Initially operated on a part-time basis, the air ambulance became a seven-day service in January 2000 and shortly afterwards moved from its original [[Rochester Airport (England)|Rochester Airport]] base to its current base at [[Marden, Kent|Marden]] near [[Maidstone]].<ref name="Horn2008">{{cite news|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kentonline/newsarchive.aspx?articleid=45315|title=Building towards a bright future|publisher=Kent Messenger|last=Horn|first=Jenni|date=2008-07-17}}</ref>

It operates one [[McDonnell-Douglas]] [[MD-902]] Explorer<ref name="Ref_a">{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.net/search/photo.search?regsearch=G-KAAT&distinct_entry=true|title=G-KAAT Information|publisher=Airliners.net}}</ref> helicopter ([[Aircraft registration|registration]] G-KAAT) from its headquarters in Marden.

In March 2008 it was announced that the trust would be collaborating with [[Sussex Police]] to provide a night time rescue service utilising the [[Hotel 900|Sussex police helicopter]], Hotel 900, which is equipped to fly at night. Prior to this, the service was restricted to daylight operation only.<ref name="Hall2008">{{cite news|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kentonline/newsarchive.aspx?articleid=39409|title=Night time air ambulance 'will save lives'|publisher=Kent Messenger|last=Hall|first=Emily|date=2008-03-26}}</ref>

The £1.6m that it costs to run each year is funded entirely by voluntary donations and fund-raising, such as the sale of its own lottery tickets as it receives no [[Government of the UK|government]], [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] or [[National Health Service|NHS]] funding. The service has flown over 12,000 missions since its inception.

==1998 Air Ambulance crash==

The trust suffered a tragedy in July 1998 when the air ambulance (at the time a [[Eurocopter AS355|Eurocopter AS355 Twin Squirrel]], registration G-MASK<ref name=aaib/>) crashed in good weather after colliding with power cables near [[Burham]] whilst returning to Rochester Airport following an aborted call to attend a road accident.<ref name=aaib>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaib.gov.uk/sites/aaib/cms_resources/dft_avsafety_pdf_500724.pdf|publisher=Air Accident Investigation Board|title=Bulletin No:2/2000 Aerospatiale AS355 F1 Ecureuil II G-MASK}}</ref> All three crew - the pilot, Graham Budden, and two paramedics, Tony Richardson and Mark Darby - were killed on impact.<ref name="Ref_1998">{{cite web|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/139680.stm|date=1998-07-27|title=UK Helicopter crash kills three | accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref>

Initial investigation established no cause for the crash, due to the fireball produced on impact. Controversy ensued when the pilot's employers, ''Police Aviation Services'', denied liability. On 19 February 2004, following a civil case brought by the pilot's widow to the High Court in Manchester, it ruled that the crash was caused by mechanical failure not, as had been suggested, flying low for fun, and ordered compensation to be paid.<ref name="Ref_2004">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/3504239.stm|title=Air ambulance crash pilot cleared|publisher=BBC News|date=19 February 2004 | accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref><ref name="Ref_1998a">{{cite web|publisher=Aviation Watch|year=1998|url=http://www.aviationwatch.co.uk/memoriam2.php?p=7|title=Review of pilot death - Graham Budden}}</ref>

==Expansion==
In June 2007, following a two-year fundraising campaign, spearheaded by [[Penelope Keith]], the trust began operating a second helicopter from a new base at [[Dunsfold Aerodrome]] in Surrey, serving the Surrey and Sussex area.<ref name="Ref_e">{{cite web|url=http://www.sussexairambulance.co.uk/who_we_are|title=Sussex Air Ambulance - Who we are}}</ref><ref name="Ref_2007a">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6735905.stm|title=New helicopter ambulance airborne|date=2007-06-08 | work=BBC News | accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref> This new service operates as the [[Surrey and Sussex Air Ambulance]].
