{{redirect|LD50}}

In [[toxicology]], the '''median lethal dose''', '''LD<sub>50</sub>''' (abbreviation for “[[lethal dose]], 50%”), '''LC<sub>50</sub>''' (lethal concentration, 50%) or '''LCt<sub>50</sub>''' (lethal concentration & time) of a [[toxin]], [[radiation]], or [[pathogen]] is the [[Dose (pharmacology)|dose]] required to kill half the members of a tested population after a specified test duration. LD<sub>50</sub> figures are frequently used as a general indicator of a substance's [[acute toxicity]]. The test was created by J.W. Trevan in 1927.<ref>[http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/ld50.html What is an LD50 and LC50]</ref> The term '''semilethal dose''' is occasionally used with the same meaning, in particular in translations from non-English-language texts, but can also refer to a ''sub''lethal dose; because of this ambiguity, it is usually avoided. LD<sub>50</sub> is usually determined by tests on animals such as [[laboratory mice]].
In 2011 the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved alternative methods to LD<sub>50</sub> for testing the cosmetic drug BOTOX.<ref>

== Conventions ==
The LD<sub>50</sub> is usually expressed as the mass of substance administered per unit mass of test subject, typically as ''milli[[gram]]s of substance'' per ''[[kilogram]] of body mass'', but stated as nanograms (suitable for [[botulinum]]), micrograms, milligrams, or grams (suitable for [[paracetamol]]) per kilogram as toxicity decreases. Stating it this way allows the relative toxicity of different substances to be compared, and normalizes for the variation in the size of the animals exposed (although toxicity does not always scale simply with body mass).

The choice of 50% lethality as a benchmark avoids the potential for ambiguity of making measurements in the extremes and reduces the amount of testing required. However, this also means that LD<sub>50</sub> is ''not'' the lethal dose for all subjects; some may be killed by much less, while others survive doses far higher than the LD<sub>50</sub>. Measures such as "LD<sub>1</sub>" and "LD<sub>99</sub>" (dosage required to kill 1% or 99%, respectively, of the test population) are occasionally used for specific purposes.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pdfs/97-119-a.pdf REGISTRY OF TOXIC EFFECTS OF CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES (RTECS)<br>COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO THE RTECS]</ref>

Lethal dosage often varies depending on the method of administration; for instance, many substances are less toxic when administered orally than when [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]] administered. For this reason, LD<sub>50</sub> figures are often qualified with the mode of administration, e.g., "LD<sub>50</sub> i.v."

The related quantities LD<sub>50</sub>/30 or an LD<sub>50</sub>/60 are used to refer to a dose that without treatment will be lethal to 50% of the population within (respectively) 30 or 60 days. These measures are used more commonly within [[Radiation Health Physics]], as survival beyond 60 days usually results in recovery.

A comparable measurement is '''LCt<sub>50</sub>''', which relates to lethal dosage from exposure, where C is concentration and t is time. It is often expressed in terms of mg-min/m³. ICt<span style="font-size:100%;"><sub>50</sub></span> is the dose that will cause incapacitation rather than death. These measures are commonly used to indicate the comparative efficacy of [[chemical warfare]] agents, and dosages are typically qualified by rates of breathing (e.g., resting = 10 l/min) for inhalation, or degree of clothing for skin penetration.  The concept of '''Ct''' was first proposed by [[Fritz Haber]] and is sometimes referred to as '''[[Haber's Law]]''', which assumes that exposure to 1 minute of 100&nbsp;mg/m³ is equivalent to 10 minutes of 10&nbsp;mg/m³ (1 × 100 = 100, as does 10 × 10 = 100).

Some chemicals, such as [[hydrogen cyanide]], are rapidly detoxified by the human body, and do not follow Haber's Law.  So, in these cases, the lethal concentration may be given simply as '''LC<sub>50</sub>''' and qualified by a duration of exposure (e.g., 10 minutes). The [[Material Safety Data Sheet]]s for toxic substances frequently use this form of the term even if the substance does follow Haber's Law.

For disease-causing organisms, there is also a measure known as the median infective dose and dosage.  The median infective dose (ID<sub>50</sub>) is the number of organisms received by a person or test animal qualified by the route of administration (e.g., 1,200 org/man per oral).  Because of the difficulties in counting actual organisms in a dose, infective doses may be expressed in terms of biological assay, such as the number of LD<sub>50</sub>'s to some test animal.  In [[biological warfare]] infective dosage is the number of infective doses per minute for a cubic meter (e.g., ICt<sub>50</sub> is 100 medium doses - min/m³).

== Limitation ==
As a measure of toxicity, LD<sub>50</sub> is somewhat unreliable and results may vary greatly between testing facilities due to factors such as the genetic characteristics of the sample population, animal species tested, environmental factors and mode of administration.<ref name="ReferenceA">Ernest Hodgson - A Textbook of Modern Toxicology; Wiley-Interscience 2004 (3rd Edition)</ref> 

There can be wide variability between species as well; what is relatively safe for rats may very well be extremely toxic for humans, and vice versa. For example, chocolate, harmless to humans, is known to be [[Health effects of chocolate#Potential toxicity in animals|toxic to many animals]]. When used to test [[venom]] from venomous creatures, such as [[snakes]], LD<sub>50</sub> results may be misleading due to the physiological differences between mice, rats, and humans. Many [[venomous snakes]] are specialized predators on mice, and their venom may be adapted specifically to incapacitate mice; and [[mongoose]]s may be exceptionally resistant. While most [[mammals]] have a very similar physiology, LD<sub>50</sub> results may or may not be directly relevant to humans.

A low LD<sub>50</sub> in animals is always a cause for concern for humans, but a high animal value does not guarantee that a substance is similarly harmless to humans.

== Examples ==

NOTE: Comparing substances (especially drugs) to each other by LD<sub>50</sub> can be misleading in many cases due (in part) to differences in [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|effective dose]] (ED<sub>50</sub>).  Therefore, it is more useful to compare such substances by [[therapeutic index]], which is simply the ratio of LD<sub>50</sub> to ED<sub>50</sub>.

The following examples are listed in reference to LD<sub>50</sub> values, in descending order, and accompanied by LC<sub>50</sub> values, {bracketed}, when appropriate.

== Animal rights concerns ==
[[Animal rights|Animal-rights]] and [[Animal welfare|animal-welfare]] groups, such as Animal Rights International,<ref>[http://www.ari-online.org/main.html Thirty-Two Years of Measurable Change]</ref> have campaigned against LD<sub>50</sub> testing on animals in particular as, in the case of some substances, causing the animals to die slow, painful deaths. Several countries, including the [[United Kingdom|UK]], have taken steps to ban the oral LD<sub>50</sub>, and the [[Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) abolished the requirement for the oral test in 2001 (see Test Guideline 401, ''Trends in Pharmacological Sciences'' Vol 22, February 22, 2001).
