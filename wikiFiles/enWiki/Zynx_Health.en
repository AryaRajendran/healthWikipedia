Zynx Health was formed in 1996 by thought leaders in evidence-based healthcare and healthcare quality improvement. As of 2004 it is a subsidiary of [[Hearst Corporation]].

== History ==
In 1996 a group of clinicians at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] founded Zynx Health as a wholly owned subsidiary of the hospital. An earlier pilot project had demonstrated the value of evidence-based guidelines in hospitals, suggesting a clear opportunity to improve patient care. The company’s first significant advancements were in 2002 and 2003, when healthcare providers realized the merit in outsourcing clinical decision support.<ref>Hagland, Mark. (June 2011). “Showing Them the Evidence.” ''Healthcare Informatics''. http://www.healthcare-informatics.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&tier=4&id=19215ECF63D44080B3B5647ADD59B3F5</ref>
