'''Sertraline hydrochloride''' (trade names '''Zoloft''', '''Lustral''') is an [[antidepressant]] of the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) class. It was introduced to the market by [[Pfizer]] in 1991. Sertraline is primarily prescribed for [[major depressive disorder]] in adult [[Patient#Outpatients and inpatients|outpatients]] as well as [[obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive–compulsive]], [[panic disorder|panic]], and [[social anxiety disorder|social anxiety]] disorders in both adults and children. In 2011, it was the second-most prescribed antidepressant on the U.S. retail market, with 37,208,000 prescriptions.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://psychcentral.com/lib/2012/top-25-psychiatric-medication-prescriptions-for-2011/|title = Top 25 Psychiatric Medication Prescriptions for 2011| accessdate = 2013-01-09|author = John M. Grohol|year = 2012|publisher = Psych Central}}</ref>

The efficacy of sertraline for depression is similar to that of older tricyclic antidepressants, but its side effects are much less pronounced. Differences with newer antidepressants are subtler and also mostly confined to side effects. Evidence suggests that sertraline may work better than [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac) for some subtypes of depression.<ref name="pmid10529069"/> Treatment of [[panic disorder]] with sertraline results in a significant decrease of the number of panic attacks and in improved quality of life.<ref name="pmid10945134"></ref> For obsessive-compulsive disorder, sertraline is not as effective as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]]; the best results have been achieved by combining these two treatments.<ref name="pmid15507582"></ref><ref name="pmid16889458"></ref> Although approved for [[social phobia]] and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], sertraline leads to only modest improvement in these conditions.<ref name="pmid14709946"/><ref name="pmid11343529">CGI-Improvement, mean ± SD: Sertraline = 2.3 ± 0.1 Placebo = 2.8 ± 0.1.

Sertraline shares the common side effects and [[contraindication]]s of other SSRIs, with high rates of nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, and sexual side effects; however, it does not cause weight gain, and its effects on both [[cognition]] and [[vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]] are relatively mild. In pregnant women taking sertraline, the drug was present in significant concentrations in fetal blood, and was also associated with a higher rate of various [[Congenital abnormality|birth defect]]s. Similarly to other antidepressants, the use of sertraline for depression may be associated with a higher rate of suicidality.

==Medical uses==
Sertraline is used for a number of conditions including: [[major depressive disorder|major depression]], [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[Body dysmorphic disorder]] (BDD), [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]] (PMDD), [[panic disorder]] and social phobia ([[social anxiety disorder]]).<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Sertraline hydrochloride|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/sertraline-hydrochloride.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> It has also been used for [[premature ejaculation]] and [[vascular headaches]] but evidence of the effectiveness in treating those conditions is less robust.<ref name=AHFS/>

===Depression===
The original pre-marketing clinical trials demonstrated only weak-to-moderate efficacy of sertraline for depression.<ref name="pmid18199864">{{cite journal |author=Turner EH, Matthews AM, Linardatos E, Tell RA, Rosenthal R |title=Selective publication of antidepressant trials and its influence on apparent efficacy |journal=N.

====Depression in the elderly====
Sertraline used for the treatment of depression in elderly (older than 60) patients was superior to [[placebo]] and comparable to another SSRI fluoxetine, and TCAs amitriptyline, [[nortriptyline]] (Pamelor) and imipramine. Sertraline had much lower rates of adverse effects than these TCAs, with the exception of nausea, which occurred more frequently with sertraline.

===Panic disorder===
In four large [[Blind experiment#Double-blind trials|double-blind]] studies sertraline was shown to be superior to [[placebo]] for the treatment of panic disorder. The response rate was independent of the dose (50–200&nbsp;mg). In addition to decreasing the frequency of panic attacks by about 80% (vs. 45% for placebo) and decreasing general anxiety, sertraline resulted in improvement of quality of life on most parameters. The patients rated as "improved" on sertraline reported better quality of life than the ones who "improved" on placebo.

===Premenstrual dysphoric disorder===
According to several double-blind studies, sertraline is effective in alleviating the symptoms of [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder|PMDD]], a severe form of [[premenstrual syndrome]]. Significant improvement was observed in 50–60% of cases treated with sertraline vs. 20–30% of cases on placebo. The improvement began during the first week of treatment, and in addition to mood, irritability, and anxiety, improvement was reflected in better family functioning, social activity and general quality of life. Work functioning and physical symptoms, such as swelling, bloating and breast tenderness, were less responsive to sertraline.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Yonkers KA, Halbreich U, Freeman E, Brown C, Endicott J, Frank E, Parry B, Pearlstein T, Severino S, Stout A, Stone A, Harrison W.|title= Symptomatic improvement of premenstrual dysphoric disorder with sertraline treatment.

According to Pfizer, sertraline is [[contraindicated]] in individuals taking [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s or the [[antipsychotic]] [[pimozide]] (Orap). Sertraline concentrate contains alcohol, and is therefore contraindicated with [[disulfiram]] (Antabuse). The prescribing information recommends that treatment of the elderly and patients with liver impairment "must be approached with caution". Due to the slower elimination of sertraline in these groups, their exposure to sertraline may be as high as three times the average exposure for the same dose.<ref name="zoloftpi">{{cite web |url=http://www.zoloft.com |title=Zoloft Prescribing Information for the U.S|format= PDF|publisher=Pfizer |accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref>

===Overdosage===
Acute overdosage is often manifested by emesis, lethargy, ataxia, tachycardia and seizures. Plasma, serum or blood concentrations of sertraline and norsertraline, its major active metabolite, may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities.<ref>R.

===In pregnancy and lactation===
The studies comparing the levels of sertraline and its principal [[metabolite]], [[desmethylsertraline]], in mother's blood to their concentration in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery indicated that fetal exposure to sertraline and its metabolite is approximately a third of the maternal exposure.<ref name="pmid11082480">{{cite journal |author=Hostetter A, Ritchie JC, Stowe ZN |title=Amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood concentrations of antidepressants in three women |journal=Biol.

===Sexual side effects===
Like other SSRIs, sertraline is associated with sexual side effects, including [[sexual arousal disorder]] and difficulty achieving orgasm. The observed frequency of sexual side effects depends greatly on whether they are reported by patients spontaneously, as in the manufacturer's trials, or actively solicited by the physicians. There have been several [[blind experiment|double-blind studies]] of sexual side effects comparing sertraline with placebo or other antidepressants.<ref name="pmid11229450">{{cite journal |author=Ferguson JM |title=The effects of antidepressants on sexual functioning in depressed patients: a review |series=62 |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=Suppl 3 |pages=22–34 |year=2001 |pmid=11229450}}</ref> While [[nefazodone]] (Serzone) and [[bupropion]] (Wellbutrin) did not have negative effects on sexual functioning, 67% of men on sertraline experienced ejaculation difficulties vs. 18% before the treatment<ref name="pmid11229450"/> (or 61% vs. 0% according to another paper).<ref name="pmid9448656"/> Similarly, in a group of women who initially did not have difficulties achieving orgasm, 41% acquired this problem during treatment with sertraline.<ref name="pmid9448656"/> A 40% rate of [[anorgasmia|orgasm dysfunction]] (vs. 9% for placebo) on sertraline was observed in a mixed group in another study.<ref name="pmid10363731">{{cite journal |author=Croft H, Settle E, Houser T, Batey SR, Donahue RM, Ascher JA |title=A placebo-controlled comparison of the antidepressant efficacy and effects on sexual functioning of sustained-release bupropion and sertraline |journal=Clinical Therapeutics |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=643–58 |year=1999 |pmid=10363731 |doi=10.1016/S0149-2918(00)88317-4}}</ref> [[Sexual arousal]] disorder, defined as "inadequate lubrication and swelling for women and erectile difficulties for men", occurred in 12% of patients on sertraline as compared with 1% of patients on placebo.

===Suicide===
The FDA requires all antidepressants, including sertraline, to carry a [[black box warning]] stating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of FDA experts that found a 2-fold increase of suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents, and a 1.5-fold increase of suicidal behavior in the 18–24 age group.<ref name=FDA>{{cite web|author = Levenson M, Holland C| title =Antidepressants and Suicidality in Adults: Statistical Evaluation.

[[Suicidal ideation]] and behavior in clinical trials are rare. For the above analysis, the FDA combined the results of 295&nbsp;trials of 11&nbsp;antidepressants for psychiatric indications in order to obtain [[statistically significant]] results. Considered separately, sertraline use in adults decreased the odds of suicidal behavior with a marginal statistical significance by 37%<ref name =FDA3/> or 50%<ref name =FDA2/> depending on the statistical technique used. The authors of the FDA analysis note that "given the large number of comparisons made in this review, chance is a very plausible explanation for this difference".<ref name =FDA2/> The more complete data submitted later by the sertraline manufacturer Pfizer indicated increased suicidal behavior.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/06n0414/06N-0414-EC32-Attach-1.pdf |title=Memorandum from Pfizer Global Pharmaceuticals Re: DOCKET: 2006N-0414&nbsp;–"Suicidality data from adult antidepressant trials" Background package for December 13 Advisory Committee|accessdate=2008-07-11 |author=Pfizer Inc. |date= 2006-11-30|format=PDF |work=FDA DOCKET 2006N-0414 |publisher=FDA}}</ref> Similarly, the analysis conducted by the UK [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] found a 50% increase of odds of suicide-related events, not reaching statistical significance, in the patients on sertraline as compared to the ones on placebo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/pl-p/documents/drugsafetymessage/con019472.pdf |title=Report of the CSM expert working group on the safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants|accessdate=2008-07-11 |date=2004-12 |format=PDF |publisher=MHRA}}</ref><ref name="pmid15718537">{{cite journal |author=Gunnell D, Saperia J, Ashby D |title=Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and suicide in adults: meta-analysis of drug company data from placebo controlled, randomised controlled trials submitted to the MHRA's safety review |journal=BMJ |volume=330 |issue=7488 |pages=385 |year=2005 |pmid=15718537 |doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7488.385 |pmc=549105}}</ref>

===Discontinuation syndrome===
{{Main|SSRI discontinuation syndrome}}
Abrupt interruption of sertraline treatment may result in withdrawal or discontinuation syndrome.

==Pharmacokinetics==

==History==
[[Image:Development of Sertraline.svg|thumb|150px|right|[[Skeletal formula]]e of chlorprothixene and tametraline, from which sertraline was derived]]
The history of sertraline dates back to the early 1970s, when [[Pfizer]] chemist Reinhard Sarges invented a novel series of psychoactive compounds based on the structures of neuroleptics [[chlorprothixene]] and [[thiothixene]].<ref name=Welch/><ref>{{cite journal |author= Sarges R, Tretter JR, Tenen SS, Weissman A |title=5,8-Disubstituted 1-Aminotetralins. A Class of Compounds with a Novel Profile of Central Nervous System Activity |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=16 |issue=9|pages=1003–1011 |year=1973 |doi=10.1021/jm00267a010 |pmid= 4795663}}</ref> Further work on these compounds led to [[tametraline]], a [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|norepinephrine]] and weaker [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]]. Development of tametraline was soon stopped because of undesired [[stimulant]] effects observed in animals. A few years later, in 1977, pharmacologist Kenneth Koe, after comparing the structural features of a variety of reuptake inhibitors, became interested in the tametraline series. He asked another Pfizer chemist, Willard Welch, to synthesize some previously unexplored tametraline derivatives. Welch generated a number of potent norepinephrine and [[serotonin-noradrenaline-dopamine reuptake inhibitor|triple reuptake]] inhibitors, but to the surprise of the scientists, one representative of the generally inactive [[cis-trans isomerism|cis-analogs]] was a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Welch then prepared [[stereoisomerism|stereoisomers]] of this compound, which were tested ''[[in vivo]]'' by animal [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral scientist]] Albert Weissman. The most potent and selective (+)-isomer was taken into further development and eventually named sertraline. Weissman and Koe recalled that the group did not set up to produce an antidepressant of the SSRI type—in that sense their inquiry was not "very goal driven", and the discovery of the sertraline molecule was [[serendipity#Pharmacology|serendipitous]]. According to Welch, they worked outside the mainstream at Pfizer, and even "did not have a formal project team". The group had to overcome initial bureaucratic reluctance to pursue sertraline development, as Pfizer was considering licensing an antidepressant candidate from another company.<ref name=Welch>The most complete account of sertraline discovery, targeted at chemists, see: {{cite journal |author=Welch WM |title=Discovery and Development of Sertraline |journal=Advances in Medicinal Chemistry |volume=3 |pages=113–148 |year=1995 |doi=10.1016/S1067-5698(06)80005-2 |series=Advances in Medicinal Chemistry |isbn=978-1-55938-798-9}}</ref><ref>See also: {{cite journal |doi=10.1021/cen-v084n010.p045 |author=Mullin R |title=ACS Award for Team Innovation |journal=Chemical & Engineering News |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=45–52 |year=2006}}</ref><ref>A short blurb on the history of sertraline, see: {{cite journal |author=Couzin J |title=The brains behind blockbusters |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=309 |issue=5735 |pages=728 |year=2005 |pmid=16051786 |doi=10.1126/science.309.5735.728}}</ref>

Sertraline was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1991 based on the recommendation of the Psychopharmacological Drugs Advisory Committee; it had already become available in [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]] the previous year.<ref name=He168>{{cite book |title=The Antidepressant Era |last=Healy |first=David |authorlink=David Healy (psychiatrist)|year=1999 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=0-674-03958-0 |pages=168}}</ref> The FDA committee achieved a consensus that sertraline was safe and effective for the treatment of [[major depressive disorder|major depression]]. During the discussion, Paul Leber, Director of the FDA Division of Neuropharmacological Drug Products, noted that granting approval was a "tough decision", since the treatment effect on [[Patient#Outpatients and inpatients|outpatients]] with depression had been "modest to minimal". Other experts emphasized that the drug's effect on inpatients had not differed from [[placebo]] and criticized poor design of the trials by Pfizer.<ref name=pdac>{{cite web |url = http://www.healyprozac.com/PDAC/PDAC-Zoloft%20Nov%2090.pdf |title= Minutes of the 33rd Meeting of Psychopharmacological Drugs Advisory Committee on November 19, 1990 |accessdate=2008-07-11 |publisher=FDA |year=1990 |format=PDF}}</ref> For example, 40% of participants dropped out of the trials, significantly decreasing their [[validity]].<ref name="pmid8573661">See also:{{cite journal |author=Fabre LF, Abuzzahab FS, Amin M, Claghorn JL, Mendels J, Petrie WM, Dubé S, Small JG |title=Sertraline safety and efficacy in major depression: a double-blind fixed-dose comparison with placebo |journal=Biol.

Until 2002, sertraline was only approved for use in adults ages 18 and over; that year, it was approved by the FDA for use in treating children aged 6 or older with severe [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD). In 2003, the UK [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] issued a guidance that, apart from [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac), [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]] are not suitable for the treatment of depression in patients under 18.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pressreleases/CON002045|title=Safety review of antidepressants used by children completed |accessdate=2008-07-11 |publisher=[[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] |date=2003-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,1103563,00.html|title = Drugs for depressed children banned|last = Boseley|first = Sarah|date = 2003-12-10|accessdate = 2007-04-19|work = [[The Guardian]]}}</ref> However, sertraline can still be used in the UK for the treatment of OCD in children and adolescents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/Safetywarningsalertsandrecalls/Safetywarningsandmessagesformedicines/CON019494 |title=Overview of regulatory status and CSM advice relating to major depressive disorder (MDD) in children and adolescents |accessdate=2008-04-17 |publisher=MHRA}}</ref> In 2005, the FDA added a [[black box warning]] concerning pediatric suicidal behavior to all [[antidepressant]]s, including sertraline.

The brand-name form of sertraline, Zoloft, was [[direct-to-consumer advertising|advertised to consumers]] by Pfizer using the following wording: "While the cause is unknown, depression may be related to an imbalance of natural chemicals between nerve cells in the brain. Prescription Zoloft works to correct this imbalance. You just shouldn't have to feel this way anymore." An essay published in the journal ''[[PLoS Medicine]]'' noted that there is no scientific support for the "serotonin imbalance" theory of depression, and criticized Pfizer and manufacturers of other SSRIs for using it. When asked to comment on this apparent breach of federal regulations, the FDA answered that such "reductionist statements" are acceptable to explain the neurochemistry of depression "to the fraction of the public that functions at no higher than a 6th-grade reading level."<ref name="PLoS">{{cite journal |author=Lacasse J, Leo J |title=Serotonin and depression: a disconnect between the advertisements and the scientific literature |journal=[[PLoS Medicine|PLoS Med]] |volume=2 |issue=12 |pages=e392 |year=2005 |pmid=16268734 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020392 |pmc=1277931}} [http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020392 Free full text, open-access source]</ref> However, the FDA reacted promptly with a [[FDA Warning Letter|Warning Letter]] when a Zoloft advertisement omitted information about the risk of suicidal behavior.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/warn/2005/zoloft_letter.pdf |format=PDF|title=Food and Drug Administration Division of Drug Marketing Advertising and Communications.
