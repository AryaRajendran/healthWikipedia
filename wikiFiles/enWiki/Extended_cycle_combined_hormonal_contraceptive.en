'''Extended cycle combined oral contraceptive''' pills are [[combined oral contraceptive pill|COCPs]] packaged to reduce or eliminate the withdrawal bleeding that occurs once every 28 days in traditionally packaged COCPs.  Extended cycle use of COCPs may also be called '''menstrual suppression'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arhp.org/healthmatters/UnderstandingMenstrualSuppression.cfm |title=Health Matters: Understanding Menstrual Suppression |accessdate=2007-11-16 |year = 2006 |month = October |publisher=Association of Reproductive Health Professionals}}</ref>

Other combined hormonal contraceptives (those containing both an [[estrogen]]<!--This is the correct American spelling, please do not edit war to change to the British "oestrogen"--> and a [[progestogen]]) may also be used in an extended or continuous cycle.  For example, the [[NuvaRing]] vaginal ring<!--

==History==
{{Expand section|date=June 2007}}

Before the advent of modern contraceptives, reproductive age women spent most of their time either pregnant or nursing.  In modern western society women typically have about 450 periods during their lives, as compared to about 160 formerly.<ref name=Rowlands>{{cite journal

Although it was evident that the pill could be used to suppress [[menstruation]] for arbitrary lengths of time, the original regimen was designed to produce withdrawal bleeding every four weeks to mimic the menstrual cycle.<ref name=gladwell>{{cite journal | last = Gladwell | first = Malcolm | title = John Rock's Error | journal = The New Yorker | date = 2000-03-10 | url= http://www.gladwell.com/2000/2000_03_10_a_rock.htm | accessdate=2009-02-04}}</ref>

==Usage==
When a woman takes COCPs ([[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s), the hormones in the pills prevent both ovulation and shedding of the [[endometrium]] ([[menstruation]]).  Traditionally, COCPs are packaged with 21 active (hormone-containing) pills and 7 [[placebo]] pills.  During the week of placebo pills, withdrawal bleeding occurs and simulates an average 28-day [[menstrual cycle]].  The placebo pills are not required for pregnancy protection, and with any monophasic COCP the placebo pills may be skipped (going straight to the next pack of active pills) to prevent the withdrawal bleeding.<!--
 --><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kripke C |title=Cyclic vs. continuous or extended-cycle combined contraceptives |journal=American Family Physician |volume=73 |issue=5 |pages=804 |year=2006 |pmid=16529087 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20060301/cochrane.html#c3 |accessdate=2007-06-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929104832/http://www.aafp.org/afp/20060301/cochrane.html#c3 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-29}}</ref>  With bi- and tri-phasic pills, skipping the placebo week results in a sudden change in hormone levels, which may cause irregular spotting or flow.

Recently, several pharmaceutical companies have gained FDA approval to package COCPs for the intended use of reducing the frequency of or completely eliminating withdrawal bleeding.

==Clinical indications==
Extended or continuous use of COCPs has been used for many years to treat [[endometriosis]], [[dysmenorrhea]], and menstruation-associated symptoms.<!--

Women's satisfaction with their contraception, compliance in taking the pills on time, and discontinuation rates are not significantly different between traditional and extended cycle regimens.<ref name="edelman" />

==Side effects==
With all extended-cycle COCPs, [[breakthrough bleeding]] is the most common side effect, although it tends to decrease over time.<!--

===Ad campaign===
One of the early extended-cycle COCPs, Seasonale, was marketed with the campaign, "''Fewer periods.  More possibilities.''"  In December 2004, Barr Pharmaceuticals was warned by the FDA concerning these television advertisements. As the warning stated, "''By omitting and minimizing the risks associated with Seasonale, the TV ad misleadingly suggests that Seasonale is safer than has been demonstrated by substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience.''"<!--
 --><ref>{{cite web|month=December | year=2003 |url= http://www.fda.gov/cder/warn/2004/12748.pdf |title= Seasonale (levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol) Tablets MACMIS ID #12748: 2004 |publisher= United States Department of Health & Human Services| accessdate=2006-10-22|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061014104309/http://www.fda.gov/cder/warn/2004/12748.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-14}}</ref> Although clinical studies had proven Seasonale to be effective in preventing pregnancy, the FDA felt the commercial advertisements omitted the common side effects of irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting.

==Brands==
''Seasonale'' is produced by Duramed Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of [[Barr Pharmaceuticals]]; Barr Pharmaceuticals also produces the same medicine as a generic called ''Jolessa''.  ''Quasense'' is the generic version produced by [[Watson Pharmaceuticals]].  Seasonale contains 30 micrograms of [[ethinylestradiol]] and 150 micrograms of [[levonorgestrel]] in each active pill. Seasonale reduces the frequency of [[menstrual periods]] from thirteen per year to four per year by changing the regimen of active pills from 21 to 84. Each package has 84 active pills and seven [[placebo]] pills to be taken at the end of the active cycle.<ref name="seasonale" />

''Seasonique'', also produced by Duramed Pharmaceuticals, has active pills and packaging identical to Seasonale, but replaces the placebo week with a low-dosage week of estrogen.

''Lybrel'' is produced by [[Wyeth Pharmaceuticals]].  It contains 90 mcg [[levonorgestrel]] and 20 mcg [[ethinyl estradiol]] in each pill, and is designed to be taken continuously with no placebos.<!--
