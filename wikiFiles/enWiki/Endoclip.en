[[Image:Resolution clip.jpg|right|thumb|A single-use rotatable endoclip in packaging]]

An '''endoclip''' is a metallic mechanical device used in [[endoscopy]] in order to close two mucosal surfaces without the need for surgery and [[surgical suture|suturing]].  Its function is similar to a [[surgical suture|suture]] in gross surgical applications, as it is used to join together two disjointed surfaces, but, can be applied through the channel of an endoscope under direct visualization.  Endoclips have found use in treating [[GI bleed|gastrointestinal bleeding]] (both in the [[upper gastrointestinal bleed|upper]] and [[lower gastrointestinal bleeding|lower GI tract]]), in preventing bleeding after therapeutic procedures such as [[polypectomy]], and in closing [[gastrointestinal perforation]]s.  Many forms of endoclips exist of different shapes and sizes, including two and three prong devices, which can be administered using single use and reloadable systems, and may or may not open and close to facilitate placement.

The endoclip was first described by Hayashi and Kudoh in 1975,<!--

-->and was termed the "staunch clip".  Initial attempts to incorporate the clip into applications in endoscopy (such as clipping bleeding [[blood vessel]]s) were limited by the applicator system of the clip.<ref name=Cliprev/>  However, by 1988, an easy to use applicator delivery system was developed, and a functional reloadable endoclip system was described.<!--

Endoclips in use today have a variety of additional shapes and sizes.  Clips with two and three prongs (TriClip, [[Cook Medical]]<!--

When a treatable lesion is identified on [[endoscopy]] (such as a bleeding vessel), an endoclip can be inserted through the channel of the endoscope until the sheathed clip is visible on the endoscopic image, and the handle for deployment handed to the [[nurse]] assistant.  The clip is unsheathed by retraction at the handle, positioned, and "fired" by the assistant to treat the lesion.

==Applications of endoclips==
===Gastrointestinal bleeding===
Endoclips have found a primary application in [[hemostasis]] (or the stopping of bleeding) during [[endoscopy]] of the upper (through [[gastroscopy]]) or lower (through [[colonoscopy]]) gastrointestinal tract.<ref name=Cliprev/>  Many bleeding lesions have been successfully clipped, including bleeding [[peptic ulcers]],<ref name=triclip/> [[Mallory-Weiss tear]]s of the [[esophagus]],<!--

===Other applications===
[[Image:Postpolypectomy ulcer.jpg|right|thumb|An ulcer seen after [[polypectomy]] (left) with a visible vessel suggesting recent bleeding is successfully closed with two endoclips (right)]]

Endoclips have also found an application in preventing bleeding when performing complicated endoscopic procedures.  For example, prophylactic clipping of the base of a polyp has been found to be useful in preventing post-[[polypectomy]] bleeding, especially in high-risk patients or patients on [[anticoagulant]] medications.<!--
