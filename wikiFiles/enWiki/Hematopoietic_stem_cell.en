'''[[Haematopoiesis|Hematopoietic]] [[stem cells]]''' ('''HSCs''') are the blood cells that give rise to all the other blood cells. 

They give rise to the [[myeloid]] ([[monocytes]] and [[macrophages]], [[neutrophils]], [[basophils]], [[eosinophils]], [[erythrocytes]], [[megakaryocytes]]/[[platelets]], [[dendritic cells]]), and [[lymphoid]] lineages ([[T-cells]], [[B-cells]], [[NK-cells]]). The definition of hematopoietic stem cells has changed in the last two decades. The hematopoietic tissue contains cells with long-term and short-term regeneration capacities and committed [[multipotent]], [[oligopotency|oligopotent]], and [[Unipotency|unipotent]] progenitors. HSCs constitute 1:10.000 of cells in [[myeloid tissue]].

HSCs are a heterogeneous population.  Three classes of stem cells exist, distinguished by their ratio of lymphoid to myeloid progeny (L/M) in blood. Myeloid-biased (My-bi) HSC have low L/M ratio (>0, <3), whereas lymphoid-biased (Ly-bi) HSC show a large ratio (>10). The third category consists of the balanced (Bala) HSC for which 3 ≤ L/M ≤ 10. Only the myeloid-biased and -balanced HSCs have durable self-renewal properties.  In addition, serial transplantation experiments have shown that each subtype preferentially re-creates its blood cell type distribution, suggesting an inherited epigenetic program for each subtype.

[[Image:Gray72-en.svg|thumb|Sketch of bone marrow and its cells]]

HSCs are found in the [[bone marrow]] of adults, with large quantities in the pelvis, [[femur]], and [[Human sternum|sternum]]. They are also found in [[umbilical cord]] blood and, in small numbers, in [[peripheral blood]].{{ref?|date=March 2013}} 

Stem and progenitor cells can be taken from the pelvis, at the iliac crest, using a needle and syringe.{{ref?|date=March 2013}} The cells can be removed a liquid (to perform a smear to look at the cell morphology) or they can be removed via a core biopsy (to maintain the architecure or relationship of the cells to each other and to the bone).{{ref?|date=March 2013}}

In order to harvest stem cells from the circulating peripheral, blood donors are injected with a cytokine, such as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), that induce cells to leave the bone marrow and circulate in the blood vessels.{{ref?|date=March 2012}}. 

In mammalian embryology, the first definitive HSCs are detected in the AGM ([[Aorta-gonad-mesonephros]]), and then massively expanded in the Fetal Liver prior to colonising the bone marrow before birth.<ref>Dzierzak & Speck, Of lineage and legacy: the development of mammalian hematopoietic stem cells, Nature Immunology, 2008</ref>

==Functional characteristics==
===Multipotency and self-renewal===
As stem cells, HSC are defined by their ability to replenish all blood cell types (Multipotency) and their ability to self-renew.

It is known that a small number of HSCs can expand to generate a very large number of daughter HSCs. This phenomenon is used in [[bone marrow transplantation]], when a small number of HSCs reconstitute the hematopoietic system. This process indicates that, subsequent to bone marrow transplantation, symmetrical cell divisions into two daughter HSCs must occur.

Stem cell self-renewal is thought to occur in the [[stem cell niche]] in the bone marrow, and it is reasonable to assume that key signals present in this niche will be important in self-renewal. There is much interest in the environmental and molecular requirements for HSC self-renewal, as understanding the ability of HSC to replenish themselves will eventually allow the generation of expanded populations of HSC ''in vitro'' that can be used therapeutically.

===Stem cell heterogeneity===
It was originally believed that all HSC were alike in their self-renewal and differentiation abilities. This view was first challenged by the 2002 discovery by the Muller-Sieburg group in San Diego, who illustrated that different stem cells can show distinct repopulation patterns that are epigenetically predetermined intrinsic properties of clonal Thy-1<sup>lo</sup> SCA-1<sup>+</sup> lin<sup>-</sup> c-kit<sup>+</sup> HSC.<ref>Muller-Sieburg CE, Cho RH, Thoman M, Adkins B, Sieburg HB, Deterministc regulation of haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Blood. 2002; 100; 1302-9</ref><ref name="MullerSieburg">Muller-Sieburg CE, Cho RH, Karlson L, Huang JF, Sieburg HB. Myeloid-biased hematopoietic stem cells have extensive self-renewal capacity but generate diminished progeny with impaired IL-7 responsiveness. Blood. 2004; 103:4111-8</ref><ref>Sieburg HB, Cho RH, Dykstra B, Eaves, CJ, Muller-Sieburg, CE. The haematopoietic stem cell compartment consists of a limited number of discrete stem cell subsets. Blood. 2006; 107:2311-6. Epub 2005 Nov 15</ref> The results of these clonal studies led to the notion of lineage bias. Using the ratio <math>\rho = L/M</math> of lymphoid (L) to myeloid (M) cells in blood as a quantitative marker, the stem cell compartment can be split into three categories of HSC. Balanced (Bala) HSC repopulate peripheral white blood cells in the same ratio of myeloid to lymphoid cells as seen in unmanipulated mice (on average about 15% myeloid and 85% lymphoid cells, or 3≤ρ≤10). Myeloid-biased (My-bi) HSC give rise to too few lymphocytes resulting in ratios 0<ρ<3, while lymphoid-biased (Ly-bi) HSC generate too few myeloid cells, which results in lymphoid-to-myeloid ratios of 10<ρ<oo. All three types are norm three types of HSC, and they do not represent stages of differentiation. Rather, these are three classes of HSC, each with an epigenetically fixed differentiation program. These studies also showed that lineage bias is not stochastically regulated or dependent on differences in environmental influence. My-bi HSC self-renew longer than balanced or Ly-bi HSC. The myeloid bias results from reduced responsiveness to the lymphopoetin [[Interleukin 7]] (IL-7).<ref name="MullerSieburg" />

Subsequent to this, other groups confirmed and highlighted the original findings (refer to the excellent mini-review by Timm Schroeder<ref>Schroeder, T. Haematopoietic Stem Cell Heterogeneity: Subtypes, Not Unpredictable Behavior. Cell Stem Cell 2010. DOI 10.1016/j.stem.2010.02.006</ref>). For example, the Eaves group confirmed in 2007 that repopulation kinetics, long-term self-renewal capacity, and My-bi and Ly-bi are stably inherited intrinsic HSC properties.<ref>Dykstra, B et al. Long-Term Propagation of Distinct Hematopoietic Differentiation Programs In Vivo. Cell Stem Cell, Volume 1, Issue 2, 218-229, 16 August 2007</ref> In 2010, the Goodell group provided additional insights about the molecular basis of lineage bias in side population [[Side population]] (SP) SCA-1<sup>+</sup> lin<sup>-</sup> c-kit<sup>+</sup> HSC.<ref>Challen, G., Boles, NC, Chambers, SM, Goodell, MA. Distinct Haematopoietic Stem Cell Subtypes Are Differentially Regulated by TGF-beta1. Cell Stem Cel 2010. DOI 10.1016/j.stem.2010.02.002</ref> As previously shown for IL-7 signaling, it was found that a member of the [[transforming growth factor]] family (TGF-beta) induces and inhibits the proliferation of My-bi and Ly-bi HSC, respectively.

===Functional assays===
A ''cobblestone area-forming cell (CAFC)'' [[assay]] is a cell culture-based empirical assay. When plated onto a confluent culture of stromal [[feeder layer]], a fraction of HSCs creep between the gaps (even though the stromal cells are touching each other) and eventually settle between the stromal cells and the substratum (here the dish surface) or trapped in the cellular processes between the stromal cells. [[Emperipolesis]] is the ''in vivo'' phenomenon in which one cell is completely engulfed into another (e.g., [[thymocyte]]s into [[thymus|thymic]] [[nurse cell]]s); on the other hand, when ''in vitro'', lymphoid lineage cells creep beneath [[nurse-like cells]], the process is called [[pseudoemperipolesis]]. This similar phenomenon is more commonly known in the HSC field by the cell culture terminology ''cobble stone area-forming cells (CAFC)'', which means areas of cluster of cells that look dull [[cobblestone]]-like under phase contrast microscopy, compared to the other HSCs, which are refractile. This happens because the cells that are floating loosely on top of the stromal cells are spherical and thus refractile. However, the cells that creep beneath the stromal cells are flattened and, thus, not refractile. The mechanism of pseudoemperipolesis is only recently coming to light. It may be mediated by interaction through [[CXCR4]] (CD184) the receptor for CXC Chemokines (e.g., [[SDF-1 (biology)|SDF1]]) and [[α4β1]] [[integrin]]s.<ref>Burger JA, Spoo A, Dwenger A, Burger M, Behringer D. 	CXCR4 chemokine receptors (CD184) and alpha4beta1 integrins mediate spontaneous migration of human CD34+ progenitors and acute myeloid leukaemia cells beneath marrow stromal cells (pseudoemperipolesis).
Br J Haematol. 2003 Aug;122(4):579-89. PMID 12899713</ref>

===Mobility===
HSCs have a higher potential than other immature blood cells to pass the [[bone marrow barrier]], and, thus, may travel in the blood from the bone marrow in one bone to another bone. If they settle in the [[thymus]], they may develop into [[T cells]]. In the case of fetuses and other [[extramedullary hematopoiesis]], HSCs may also settle in the [[liver]] or [[spleen]] and develop.

This ability is the reason why HSCs may be harvested directly from the blood.

==Physical characteristics==
With regard to morphology, hematopoietic stem cells resemble lymphocytes.  They are non-adherent, and rounded, with a rounded nucleus and low cytoplasm-to-nucleus ratio.  Since PHSC cannot be isolated as a pure population, it is not possible to identify them in a microscope.  The above description is based on the morphological characteristics of a heterogeneous population, of which PHSC are a component.

==Markers==
In reference to phenotype, hematopoeitic stem cells are identified by their small size, lack of lineage (lin) markers, low staining (side population) with vital dyes such as rhodamine 123 (rhodamine<sup>DULL</sup>, also called rho<sup>lo</sup>) or Hoechst 33342, and presence of  various antigenic markers on their surface.

===Cluster of differentiation and other markers===
Many of these markers belong to the [[cluster of differentiation]] series, like: [[CD34]], [[CD38]], [[CD90]], [[CD133]], [[CD105]], [[CD45]], and also [[c-kit]], - the receptor for [[stem cell factor]]. The hematopoietic stem cells are negative for the markers that are used for detection of lineage commitment, and are, thus, called Lin-; and, during their purification by [[flow cytometry|FACS]], a bunch of up to 14 different mature blood-lineage marker, e.g., [[CD13]] & [[CD33]] for myeloid, [[CD71]] for erythroid, [[CD19]] for B cells, [[CD61]] for megakaryocytic, etc. for humans; and, [[B220]] (murine [[CD45]]) for [[B cells]], [[Integrin alpha M|Mac-1]] ([[Integrin alpha M|CD11b]]/[[CD18]]) for [[monocytes]], [[Gr-1]] for [[Granulocyte]]s, [[Ter119]] for erythroid cells, [[Il7Ra]], [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]], [[CD4]], [[CD5 (protein)|CD5]], [[CD8]] for [[T cells]], etc. (for mice) antibodies are used as a mixture to deplete the lin+ cells or late multipotent progenitors (MPP)s.

There are many differences between the human and mice hematopoietic cell markers for the commonly accepted type of hematopoietic stem cells.[http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/scireport/chapter5.asp].
*'''Mouse HSC :''' [[CD34]]<sup>lo/-</sup>, [[SCA-1]]<sup>+</sup>, [[Thy1|Thy1.1]]<sup>+/lo</sup>, [[CD38]]<sup>+</sup>, [[C-kit]]<sup>+</sup>, lin<sup>-</sup>
*'''Human HSC :''' [[CD34]]<sup>+</sup>, [[CD59]]<sup>+</sup>, [[CD90|Thy1/CD90]]<sup>+</sup>, [[CD38]]<sup>lo/-</sup>, [[CD117|C-kit/CD117]]<sup>+</sup>, lin<sup>-</sup>

However, not all stem cells are covered by these combinations that, nonetheless, have become popular. In fact, even in humans, there are hematopoietic stem cells that are [[CD34]]<sup>-</sup>/[[CD38]]<sup>-</sup>.<ref>Bhatia, M., D. Bonnet, B. Murdoch, O.I. Gan and J.E. Dick, A newly discovered class of human haematopoietic cells with [[Severe combined immunodeficiency|SCID]]-repopulating activity, 4(9), 1038, 1998.</ref><ref>Guo, Yalin, Lubbert, Michael, Engelhardt, Monika
CD34- Hematopoietic Stem Cells: Current Concepts and Controversies
Stem Cells 2003; 21: 15-20; First published online ; doi=10.1634/stemcells.21-1-15</ref> Also some later studies suggested that earliest stem cells may lack c-kit on the cell surface.<ref>H. Doi et al. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94, 2513–2517</ref> For human HSCs use of [[CD133]] was one step ahead as  both [[CD34]]<sup>+</sup> and [[CD34]]<sup>-</sup> HSCs were [[CD133]]<sup>+</sup>.

Traditional purification method used to yield a reasonable purity level of mouse hematopoietic stem cells, in general, requires a large(~10-12) battery of markers, most of which were surrogate markers with little functional significance, and thus partial overlap with the stem cell populations and sometimes other closely related cells that are not stem cells. Also, some of these markers (e.g., [[Thy1]]) are not conserved across mouse species, and use of markers like [[CD34]]<sup>-</sup> for HSC purification requires mice to be at least 8 weeks old.

===SLAM code===
Alternative methods that could give rise to similar or better harvest of stem cells is a hot area of research and are presently emerging. One such method uses a signature of ''[[signaling lymphocyte activation molecule|SLAM]]'' family of cell surface molecules. SLAM ([[Signaling lymphocyte activation molecule]]) family is a group of >10 molecules whose genes are located mostly tandemly in a single locus on chromosome 1 (mouse), all belonging to a subset of immunoglobulin gene superfamily, and originally thought to be involved in T-cell stimulation. This family includes [[CD48]], [[CD150]], [[CD244]], etc., CD150 being the founding member, and, thus, also called slamF1, i.e., SLAM family member 1.

The signature '''SLAM code''' for the hemopoietic hierarchy are:
*'''[[Hematopoietic stem cells]] (HSC) :''' [[CD150]]<sup>+</sup>[[CD48]]<sup>-</sup>[[CD244]]<sup>-</sup>
*'''[[Multipotent progenitor cell]]s (MPPs) :''' [[CD150]]<sup>-</sup>[[CD48]]<sup>-</sup>[[CD244]]<sup>+</sup>
*'''[[Lineage-restricted progenitor cell]]s (LRPs) :''' [[CD150]]<sup>-</sup>[[CD48]]<sup>+</sup>[[CD244]]<sup>+</sup>
*'''[[Common myeloid progenitor]] (CMP) :''' [[lin]]{{dn|date=February 2012}}<sup>-</sup>[[SCA-1]]<sup>-</sup>[[c-kit]]<sup>+</sup>[[CD34]]<sup>+</sup>[[CD16/32]]<sup>mid</sup>
*'''[[Granulocyte-macrophage progenitor]] (GMP) :''' [[lin]]{{dn|date=February 2012}}<sup>-</sup>[[SCA-1]]<sup>-</sup>[[c-kit]]<sup>+</sup>[[CD34]]<sup>+</sup>[[CD16/32]]<sup>hi</sup>
*'''[[Megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor]] (MEP) :''' [[lin]]{{dn|date=February 2012}}<sup>-</sup>[[SCA-1]]<sup>-</sup>[[c-kit]]<sup>+</sup>[[CD34]]<sup>-</sup>[[CD16/32]]<sup>low</sup>

For HSCs, [[CD150]]<sup>+</sup>[[CD48]]<sup>-</sup> was sufficient instead of [[CD150]]<sup>+</sup>[[CD48]]<sup>-</sup>[[CD244]]<sup>-</sup> because CD48 is a ligand for CD244, and both would be positive only in the activated lineage-restricted progenitors. It seems that this code was more efficient than the more tedious earlier set of the large number of markers, and are also conserved across the mouse strains; however, recent work has shown that this method excludes a large number of HSCs and includes an equally large number of non-stem cells.<ref>David C Weksberg, Stuart M Chambers, Nathan C Boles, and Margaret A Goodell

===LT-HSC/ST-HSC/Early MPP/Late MPP===
[[Irving Weissman]]'s group at [[Stanford University]] was the first to isolate mouse hematopoietic stem cells in 1988 and was also the first to work out the markers to distinguish the mouse long-term (LT-HSC) and short-term (ST-HSC) hematopoietic stem cells (self-renew-capable), and the Multipotent progenitors (MPP, low or no self-renew capability — the later the developmental stage of MPP, the lesser the self-renewal ability and the more of some of the markers like CD4 and [[CD135]]):

==Nomenclature of hematopoietic colonies and lineages==
Between 1948 and 1950, the Committee for Clarification of the Nomenclature of Cells and Diseases of the Blood and Blood-forming Organs issued reports on the nomenclature of blood cells.<ref>{{cite journal | author = | title = First report of the Committee for Clarification of the Nomenclature of Cells and Diseases of the Blood and Blood-forming Organs | journal = Amer J Clin Pathol | volume = 18 | issue =  | pages = 443–450 | year = 1948 | id = }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = | title = Third, fourth and fifth reports of the committee for clarification of the nomenclature of cells and diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs | journal = Am J Clin Pathol | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 562–79 | year = 1950 | pmid = 15432355}}</ref> An overview of the terminology is shown below, from earliest to final stage of development:

*[root]blast
*pro[root]cyte
*[root]cyte
*meta[root]cyte
*mature cell name

The root for erythrocyte colony-forming units (CFU-E) is "rubri", for granulocyte-monocyte colony-forming units (CFU-GM) is "granulo" or "myelo" and "mono", for lympocyte colony-forming units (CFU-L) is "lympho" and for megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Meg) is "megakaryo". According to this terminology, the stages of red blood cell formation would be: rubriblast, prorubricyte, rubricyte, metarubricyte, and erythrocyte. However, the following nomenclature seems to be, at present, the most prevalent:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Committee'''  || '''"lympho"'''  || '''"rubri"''' || '''"granulo" or "myelo"'''  || '''"mono"''' || '''"megakaryo"'''
|-
| ''Lineage'' || [[Lymphoid]]  || [[Myeloid]] || Myeloid  || Myeloid || Myeloid
|-
| ''CFU'' || [[CFU-L]]  || [[CFU-GEMM]]→[[CFU-E]] || CFU-GEMM→[[CFU-GM]]→[[CFU-G]] || CFU-GEMM→[[CFU-GM]]→[[CFU-M]] || CFU-GEMM→[[CFU-Meg]]
|-
| ''Process'' || [[lymphocytopoiesis]]  || [[erythropoiesis]] || [[granulocytopoiesis]]  || [[monocytopoiesis]] || [[thrombocytopoiesis]]
|-
| ''[root]blast'' || [[Lymphoblast]]  || [[Proerythroblast]] || [[Myeloblast]]  || [[Monoblast]] || [[Megakaryoblast]]
|-
| ''pro[root]cyte'' || [[Prolymphocyte]]  || [[Polychromatophilic erythrocyte]] || [[Promyelocyte]]  || [[Promonocyte]] || [[Promegakaryocyte]]
|-
| ''[root]cyte'' || -  || [[Normoblast]] || [[Eosinophilic myelocyte|Eosino]]/[[neutrophilic myelocyte|neutro]]/[[basophilic myelocyte]]  ||  || [[Megakaryocyte]]
|-
| ''meta[root]cyte'' || Large [[lymphocyte]]  || [[Reticulocyte]] || Eosinophilic/neutrophilic/basophilic [[metamyelocyte]], Eosinophilic/neutrophilic/basophilic [[band cell]] || [[Early monocyte]] || -
|-
| ''mature cell name'' || Small [[lymphocyte]]  || [[Erythrocyte]] || [[granulocytes]] ([[Eosinophil|Eosino]]/[[neutrophil|neutro]]/[[basophil]])  || [[Monocyte]] ||  [[thrombocytes]] ([[Platelets]])
|}

Osteoclasts also arise from hemopoietic cells of the monocyte/neutrophil lineage, specifically CFU-GM.

==Colony-forming units==
There are various kinds of colony-forming units:
*Colony-forming unit [[lymphocyte]] (CFU-L)
*Colony-forming unit [[erythrocyte]] (CFU-E)
*Colony-forming unit granulo-[[monocyte]] (CFU-GM)
*Colony-forming unit [[megakaryocyte]] (CFU-Me)
*Colony-forming unit [[Basophil]] (CFU-B)
*Colony-forming unit [[Eosinophil]] (CFU-Eo)

The above CFUs are based on the lineage. Another CFU, the ''colony-forming unit–spleen'' ('''CFU–S''') was the basis of an ''in vivo'' clonal colony formation, which depends on the ability of infused bone marrow cells to give rise to clones of maturing hematopoietic cells in the spleens of irradiated mice after 8 to 12 days. It was used extensively in early studies, but is now considered to measure more mature progenitor or '''Transit Amplifying Cells''' rather than stem cells.

== HSC repopulation kinetics ==

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) cannot be easily observed directly, and, therefore, their behaviors need to be inferred indirectly. Clonal studies are likely the closest technique for single cell in vivo studies of HSC. Here, sophisticated experimental and statistical methods are used to ascertain that, with a high probability, a single HSC is contained in a transplant administered to a lethally irradiated host. The clonal expansion of this stem cell can then be observed over time by monitoring the percent donor-type cells in blood as the host is reconstituted. The resulting time series is defined as the repopulation kinetic of the HSC.

The reconstitution kinetics are very heterogeneous. However, using [[symbolic dynamics]], one can show that they fall into a limited number of classes.<ref>Sieburg, HB, Muller-Sieburg, CE. Classification of short kinetics by shape. In Silico Biol. 2004;4(2):209-17</ref> To prove this, several hundred experimental repopulation kinetics from clonal Thy-1<sup>lo</sup> SCA-1<sup>+</sup> lin<sup>-</sup> c-kit<sup>+</sup> HSC were translated into symbolic sequences by assigning the symbols "+", "-", "~" whenever two successive measurements of the percent donor-type cells have a positive, negative, or unchanged slope, respectively. By using the [[Hamming distance]], the repopulation patterns were subjected to cluster analysis yielding 16 distinct groups of kinetics. To finish the empirical proof, the Laplace add-one approach was used to determine that the probability of finding kinetics not contained in these 16 groups is very small. By corollary, this result shows that the hematopoietic stem cell compartment is also heterogeneous by dynamical criteria.
