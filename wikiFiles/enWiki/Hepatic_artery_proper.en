The '''hepatic artery proper''' (also '''proper hepatic artery'''), arises from the [[common hepatic artery]] and runs alongside the [[portal vein]] and the [[common bile duct]] to form the [[portal triad]]. The hepatic artery proper gives off a small supraduodenal artery to the duodenal bulb.  Then the [[right gastric artery]] comes off and runs to the left along the lesser curvature of the stomach to meet the [[left gastric artery]], which is a branch of the [[celiac trunk]].  It subsequently bifurcates into the right and left hepatic arteries.  Of note, the right and left hepatic arteries may demonstrate variant anatomy.  A replaced right hepatic artery may arise from the [[superior mesenteric artery]] (SMA) and a replaced left hepatic artery may arise from the [[left gastric artery]]. The [[cystic artery]] generally comes off of the right hepatic artery. <ref name="Balija">Balija M, Huis M, Nikolic V, Stulhofer M. Laparoscopic visualization of the cystic artery anatomy.
