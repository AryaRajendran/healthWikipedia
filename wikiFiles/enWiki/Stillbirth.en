A '''stillbirth''' occurs when a [[fetus]] has [[death|died]] in the [[uterus]].  A wide variety of definitions exist.<ref>{{cite journal

|quote=There is probably no health outcome with a greater number of conflicting, authoritative, legally mandated definitions. The basic WHO definition of fetal death is the intrauterine death of any conceptus at any time during pregnancy. However, for practical purposes, legal definitions usually require recorded fetal deaths to attain some gestational age (16, 20, 22, 24, or 28 weeks) or birth weight (350, 400, 500, or 1000 g). In the US states, there are eight different definitions by combinations of gestational age and weight, and at least as many in Europe.}}</ref> Once the fetus has died, the mother may or may not have contractions and undergo childbirth.  The term is often used in distinction to [[Live birth (human)|live birth]] or [[miscarriage]] and the word miscarriage is oftentimes used incorrectly to describe stillbirths. Most stillbirths occur in full-term pregnancies.

==Human stillbirth==
===Causes===
The causes of a large percentage of human stillbirths remains unknown, even in cases where extensive testing and [[autopsy]] have been performed. A rarely used term to describe these is '''sudden antenatal death syndrome''' or SADS, a phrase coined by Cacciatore & Collins in 2000.<ref name="pmid11876571">{{cite journal |author=Collins JH |title=Umbilical cord accidents: human studies |journal=Semin. Perinatol. |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=79–82 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11876571 |doi= 10.1053/sper.2002.29860|url=}}</ref>

In cases where the cause is known, some possibilities of the cause of death are:  
*[[bacterial infection]]
*[[congenital disorder|birth defects]], especially [[pulmonary hypoplasia]]
*[[Chromosome#Chromosomal aberrations|chromosomal aberrations]]
*[[fetal development|growth retardation]]
*[[intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy]]

**"Prolapsed umbilical cord" - Prolapse of the umbilical cord happens when the fetus is not in a correct position in the pelvis. Membranes rupture and the cord is pushed out through the cervix. When the fetus pushes on the cervix, the cord is compressed and blocks blood and oxygen flow to the fetus. The mother has approximately 10 minutes to get to a doctor before there is any harm done to the fetus.
**"Monoamniotic twins" - These twins share the same placenta and the same amniotic sac and therefore can interfere with each other's umbilical cords. When entanglement of the cords is detected, it is highly recommended to deliver the fetuses as early as 31 weeks.
**Umbilical cord length - A short umbilical cord (<30&nbsp;cm) can affect the fetus in that fetal movements can cause cord compression, constriction and ruptures. A long umbilical cord (>72&nbsp;cm) can affect the fetus depending on the way the fetus interacts with the cord. Some fetuses grasp the umbilical cord but it is yet unknown as to whether a fetus is strong enough to compress and stop blood flow through the cord. Also, an active fetus, one that frequently repositions itself in the uterus can cause entanglement with the cord. A hyperactive fetus should be evaluated with ultrasound to rule out cord entanglement.
**Cord entanglement - The umbilical cord can wrap around an extremity, the body or the neck of the fetus. When the cord is wrapped around the neck of the fetus it is called a nuchal cord. Again, these entanglements can cause constriction of blood flow. These entanglements can be visualized with ultrasound.
**Torsion - This term refers to the twisting of the umbilical around itself. Torsion of the umbilical cord is very common (especially in equine stillbirths) but it is not a natural state of the umbilical cord. The umbilical cord can be untwisted at delivery. The average cord has 3 twists.

Sometimes a pregnancy is terminated deliberately during a late phase, for example for congenital anomaly. UK law requires these procedures to be registered as "stillbirths".<ref>Bythell M, et al. (2008) The contribution of late termination of pregnancy to stillbirth rates in Northern England, 1994-2005. The British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, 115(5):664-666</ref>

===Prenatal diagnosis===
It is unknown how much time is needed for a fetus to die. Fetal behavior is consistent and a change in the fetus' movements or sleep-wake cycles can indicate fetal distress.<ref name="preginst.com"/> A decrease or cessation in sensations of [[fetal activity]] may be an indication of [[fetal distress]] or death, though it is not entirely uncommon for a healthy fetus to exhibit such changes, particularly near the end of a [[pregnancy]] when there is considerably little space in the [[uterus]] for the fetus to move about. Still, [[medical examination]], including a [[nonstress test]], is recommended in the event of any type of  any change in the strength or [[frequency]] of fetal movement, especially a complete cease; most [[midwife|midwives]] and [[obstetrician]]s recommend the use of a [[kick chart]] to assist in detecting any changes. Fetal distress or death can be confirmed or ruled out via [[fetoscopy]]/[[doptone]], [[obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasound]], and/or [[electronic fetal monitoring]]. If the fetus is alive but inactive, extra attention will be given to the [[placenta]] and [[umbilical cord]] during ultrasound examination to ensure that there is no compromise of oxygen and nutrient delivery.

====Constricted umbilical cord====
When the umbilical cord is constricted (q.v. "accidents" above), the fetus experiences periods of [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], and may respond by unusually high periods of kicking or struggling, to free the umbilical cord.  These are sporadic if constriction is due to a change in the fetus' or mother's position, and may become worse or more frequent as the fetus grows. Extra attention should be given if mothers experience large increases in kicking from previous childbirths, especially when increases correspond to position changes.<ref>http://www.preginst.com/pucp.html</ref>

===Prevention===
As many of the causes are unknown or untreatable, prevention is difficult.
Symptoms of bacterial [[infection]], such as from a dental abscess, in pregnant women may also include unusual periods of incoherence and symptoms of [[shock (circulatory)|shock]], and should be treated by a physician immediately.  [[High blood pressure]], [[diabetes]] and drug use should be regulated with physician's advice.  Umbilical cord constriction may be identified and observed by [[ultrasound]], if requested.

Research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2011 found a number of maternal factors associated with stillbirth. Among them: being age 40 or older, having diabetes, having a history of addiction to illegal drugs, being overweight or obese, and smoking cigarettes in the three months before getting pregnant.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-500368_162-57342588/studies-identify-stillbirth-risk-factors-causes/ | work=CBS News | title=Studies identify stillbirth risk factors, causes}}</ref>

===Prenatal maternal treatment===
An [[in utero]] stillbirth does not usually present an immediate health risk to the woman and labour will usually begin [[spontaneous]]ly after two weeks, so the woman may choose to wait and birth the fetal remains [[Childbirth#Second stage|vaginally]]. After two weeks, the woman is at risk of developing blood [[clot]]ting problems, and [[labor induction]] is recommended at this point. In many cases, the woman will find the idea of carrying the dead fetus [[psychological trauma|emotionally traumatizing]] and will elect to be induced. [[Caesarean]] birth is not recommended unless complications develop during [[Childbirth#Second stage|vaginal birth]].

===Prevalence===
The [[mean]] stillbirth [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] in the United States is approximately 1 in 115 births, which is roughly 26,000 stillbirths each year, or on an average one every 20 minutes. In Australia,<ref name="Aust-stat">{{cite web | last = Gordon | first = Adrienne (Dr) | title = Department of Neonatal Medicine Protocol Book: Royal Prince Alfred Hospital | url = http://www.sswahs.nsw.gov.au/RPA/neonatal/html/Newprot/stillbirths.html | accessdate = 2006-09-13 }}</ref> England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the rate is approximately 1 in every 200 births, in Scotland 1 in 167. (From The National Statistical Office and other sources.)  Many stillbirths occur at fullterm to apparently healthy mothers, and a postmortem evaluation reveals a cause of death in only about 40% of autopsied cases.<ref>Cacciatore, J.  (2007). A phenomenological exploration of stillbirth and the effects of ritualization on maternal anxiety and depression, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Press, Digital Commons ; Froen, J.F. (2005).</ref>

In [[developing country|developing countries]], where [[medical]] care can be of low quality or unavailable, the stillbirth rate is much higher.

==Legal definitions of stillbirth==
===Australia===
In Australia any stillborn weighing more than 400&nbsp;grams, or more than 20 weeks in gestation, must have its birth registered.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lahra MM, Gordon A, Jeffery HE |title=Chorioamnionitis and fetal response in stillbirth |journal=Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. |volume=196 |issue=3 |pages=229.e1–4 |year=2007 |quote=Stillbirth is defined within Australia as fetal death (no signs of life), whether antepartum or intrapartum, at ≥20 weeks of gestation or ≥400 g birthweight, if gestational age is unknown. |pmid=17346531 |doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2006.10.900}}</ref>

===Austria===
In Austria a stillbirth is defined as birth of a child of at least 500 g weight without [[vital signs]], e.g. blood circulation, breath or muscle movements.

===Canada===
Beginning in 1959, "the definition of a stillbirth was revised to conform, in substance, to the definition of fetal death recommended by the [[World Health Organization]]." <ref>Statistics Canada ("Canada's National Statistical Agency"), [http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:pg80dWnVthcJ:www.statcan.ca/english/sdds/document/3234_D2_T9_V1_E.pdf+still+birth+canada+definition&hl=en&gl=uk&ct=clnk&cd=10 History, Vital Statistics - Stillbirth Database], in [http://www.statcan.ca/cgi-bin/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=3234&lang=en&db=IMDB&dbg=f&adm=8&dis=2 Vital Statistics – Stillbirth Database].</ref>  The definition of "fetal death" promulgated by the [[World Health Organization]] in 1950 is as follows:
:''"Fetal death" means death prior to the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of human conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy and which is not an induced termination of pregnancy. The death is indicated by the fact that after such expulsion or extraction, the fetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles. Heartbeats are to be distinguished from transient cardiac contractions; respirations are to be distinguished from fleeting respiratory efforts or gasps.''<ref name="CDC-def"/>

===Germany===
In Germany a stillbirth is defined as birth of a child of at least 500g weight without blood circulation or breath. Details for burial vary amongst the federal states.<ref>http://www.initiative-regenbogen.de/gesetze.htm</ref>

===Ireland===
Since 1 Jan 1995 stillbirths occurring in the Republic of Ireland must be registered; stillbirths which occurred before that date can also be registered but evidence is required.<ref>http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/birth-family-relationships/miscarriage-and-stillbirth/registering_stillbirth</ref> For the purposes of civil registration, s.1 of the Stillbirths Registration Act 1994 refers to :-

''"...a child weighing at least 500&nbsp;grammes, or having reached a gestational age of at least 24 weeks who shows no signs of life."''

===United Kingdom===
The registration of still-births has been required in England and Wales from 1927, in Scotland from 1939 but is not required in Northern Ireland [http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/registering-a-still-birth.htm].

'''England and Wales'''

For the purposes of the [[Births and Deaths Registration Act 1926]] (as amended), section 12 contains the definition that :-

''“still-born” and “still-birth” shall apply to any child which has issued forth from its mother after the twenty fourth week of pregnancy and which did not at any time after being completely expelled from its mother, breathe or show any other signs of life.''

A similar definition is applied within the [[Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953]] (as amended), contained in s.41.

The above definitions apply within those Acts thus other legislation will not necessarily be in identical terms.

s.2 of the 1953 Act requires that registration of a birth takes place within 42 days of the birth except where an inquest takes place or the child has been "found exposed" in which latter case the time limit runs from the time of finding.

Extracts from the register of still-births are restricted to those who have obtained consent from the [[Registrar General for England and Wales]].

'''Scotland'''

Section 56(1) of the [[Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act 1965]] (as amended) contains the definition that :-

''“still-born child” means a child which has issued forth from its mother after the twenty-fourth week of pregnancy and which did not at any time after being completely expelled from its mother breathe or show any other signs of life, and the expression “still-birth” shall be construed accordingly''

s.21(1) of the same Act requires that :-

''Except so far as otherwise provided by this section or as may be prescribed, the provisions of this Part of this Act shall, so far as applicable, apply to still-births in like manner as they apply to births of children born alive.''

In the general case, s.14 of the Act requires that a birth has to be registered within 21 days of the birth or of the child being found.

Unlike the registers for births, marriages, civil partnerships and deaths, the register of still-births is not open to public access and issue of extracts requires the permission of the [[Registrar General for Scotland]].

'''Northern Ireland'''

In Northern Ireland the [[Births and Deaths Registration (Northern Ireland) Order 1976]][http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1976/1041], as amended contains the definition :-

'' “still-birth” means the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother after the twenty-fourth week of pregnancy of a child which did not at any time after being completely expelled or extracted breathe or show any other evidence of life.''

Registration of still-births can be made by a relative or certain other persons involved with the still-birth but it is '''not compulsory''' to do so. Registration takes place with the District Registrar for the Registration District where the still-birth occurred or for the District in which the mother is resident. A still-birth certificate will be issued to the registrant with further copies only available to those obtaining official consent for their issue. Registration may be made within three months of the still-birth<ref>NI Direct - Registering a Still-birth [http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/registering-a-still-birth.htm] </ref>

===United States===
In the United States, there is no standard definition of the term 'stillbirth'.<!--
  --><ref name="CDC-def">{{cite book | author =Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | authorlink=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=State Definitions and Reporting Requirements |  edition=1997 Revision | publisher =National Center for Health Statistics | url=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/misc/itop97.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> 
The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] collects statistical information on "live births, fetal deaths, and induced termination of pregnancy" from 57 reporting areas in the United States. Each reporting area has different guidelines and definitions for what is being reported; many do not use the term "stillbirth" at all. The federal guidelines suggests (at page 1) that fetal death and stillbirth can be interchangeable terms. The CDC definition of "fetal death" is based on the definition promulgated by the World Health Organization in 1950 (see [[Stillbirth#Canada|section above on Canada]]).  Researchers are learning more about the long term psychiatric sequelae of traumatic birth and believe the effects may be intergenerational <ref>Cacciatore, J. (2010). Unique stories of women and their families after the death of a baby. Journal of Healthcare Social Work, 49(2), 134-148.</ref>
 
The federal guidelines recommend reporting those fetal deaths whose birth weight is over 12.5 oz (350g), or those more than 20 weeks gestation. Forty-one areas use a definition very similar to the federal definition, thirteen areas use a shortened definition of fetal death, and three areas have no formal definition of fetal death. Only 11 areas specifically use the term 'stillbirth', often synonymously with late fetal death, however they are split between whether stillbirths are "irrespective of the duration of pregnancy", or whether some age or weight constraint is applied. A movement in the U.S. has changed the way that stillbirths are documented through vital records. Previously, only the deaths were reported. However 27 states have enacted legislation that offers some variation of a birth certificate as an option for parents who choose to pay for one.
