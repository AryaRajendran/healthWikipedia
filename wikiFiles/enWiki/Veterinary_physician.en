A '''veterinary physician''', colloquially called a '''vet''', shortened from '''veterinarian''' ([[American English]], [[Australian English]]) or '''veterinary surgeon''' ([[British English]]), is a professional who practices [[veterinary medicine]] by treating disease, disorder, and injury in non-[[human]] animals.

In many countries, the local nomenclature for a vet is a regulated and protected term, meaning that members of the public without the prerequisite qualifications and/or registration are not able to use the title.  In many cases, the activities that may be undertaken by a veterinarian (such as animal treatment or surgery) are restricted only to those professionals who are registered as vet.  For instance, in the United Kingdom, as in other jurisdictions, animal treatment may only be performed by registered vets (with a few designated exceptions, such as [[paraveterinary workers]]), and it is illegal for any person who is not registered to call themselves a vet or perform any treatment.

Most vets work in clinical settings, treating animals directly.  These vets may be involved in a general practice, treating animals of all types; may be specialised in a specific group of animals such as [[pet|companion animals]], [[livestock]], [[Zoological medicine|zoo animals]] or [[horse]]s; or may specialise in a narrow medical discipline such as [[veterinary surgery|surgery]], [[dermatology]] or [[internal medicine]].

As with healthcare professionals, vets face ethical decisions about the care of their patients.  Current debates within the profession include the ethics of purely cosmetic procedures on animals, such as [[Onychectomy|declawing]] of cats, [[docking (dog)|docking of tails]], [[cropping (animal)|cropping of ears]] and [[Devocalization|debarking]] on dogs.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
The word veterinary comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''veterinae'' meaning "[[working animals]]". "Veterinarian" was first used in print by [[Thomas Browne]] in 1646.<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Oxford University Press.</ref>

The term veterinarian is used in North America and other countries using predominantly [[American English]], whereas in the United Kingdom, and countries which are formerly part of the [[British Empire]] or are part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] tend to use the term veterinary surgeon.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==History==
The earliest written records of veterinary medicine can be found in the [[Egypt]]ian ''Papyrus of Kahun'' (1900 BCE) and [[Vedas|Vedic literature]] in [[Vedic period|ancient India]]<ref>Thrusfield, Michael (2007). [http://books.google.com/books?id=LZfevagYF4YC ''Veterinary Epidemiology''], p. 2. Wiley-Blackwell</ref>

In Europe, the first attempts to organize and regulate the practice of treating animals tended to focus on horses because of their economic significance. In the Middle Ages, [[farrier]]s combined their work in shoeing and generally caring for horses' hooves with "horse doctoring". In 1356, the [[Lord Mayor of London]], concerned at the poor standard of care given to horses in the city, requested that all farriers operating within a seven mile radius of the [[City of London]] form a "fellowship" to regulate and improve their practices.<ref> Hunter, Pamela (2004). [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TLyFllgGgu0C&pg=PA4&dq=Charles+Benoit+Vial+de+St+Bel&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oiwnUcyXK8XL0AXAnoD4Bg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Charles%20Benoit%20Vial%20de%20St%20Bel&f=false ''Veterinary Medicine: A Guide to Historical Sources''], p. 1. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.</ref> 

The first veterinary college in Europe was founded in [[Lyon]], France in 1762 by [[Claude Bourgelat]]. In the ensuing 20 years similar colleges were established in other European cities.  The [[Veterinary College of London]] was founded in 1791 by a group led by [[Granville Penn]].<ref>Hunter (2004) p. 4</ref> In the United States, the first veterinarians had been trained in Europe. However, Boston, New York and Philadelphia all had their own private veterinary schools by the 1850s. These urban schools concentrated primarily on the care of horses. By the turn of the 20th century, several American agricultural colleges had started their own veterinary schools which were focused on livestock animals. In 1879, [[Iowa Agricultural College]] became the first [[land grant college]] to establish a school of veterinary medicine.<ref>Widder, Keith R. (2005). [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aAIB3DC5KR8C&pg=PA107&dq=first+veterinary+college+United+States&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0DknUdOTJqKr0AWo6YHgCg&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=first%20veterinary%20college%20United%20States&f=false ''Michigan Agricultural College: The Evolution Of A Land-Grant Philosophy, 1855-1925''], p. 107. MSU Press</ref>

==Roles and responsibilities==
[[File:Picture 468.jpg|thumb|left]]
Vets are primarily required to treat disease, disorder or injury in animals, which includes [[diagnose|diagnosis]], treatment and aftercare.  The scope of practice, speciality and experience of the individual vets will dictate exactly what interventions they perform, but most will perform surgery (of differing complexity).

Unlike in adult human medicine, vets must rely on [[clinical signs]], as animals are unable to vocalise [[symptom]]s as a human would (and in that respect is similar to medicine on human children).  In some cases, owners may be able to provide a [[medical history]] and the vet can combine this information along with observations, and the results of pertinent diagnostic tests such as [[x-ray]]s, [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]], [[blood test]]s, [[urinalysis]] or other diagnostics.

As with human medicine, much veterinary work is concerned with [[prophylactic treatment]], in order to prevent problems occurring in the future.  Common interventions include [[vaccination]] against common animal illnesses, such as [[Canine distemper|distemper]] or [[rabies]].  This may also involve being involved in owner education so as to avoid future medical or behavioural issues.

Unlike in most human medicine, vets will often consider the appropriateness of [[animal euthanasia|euthanasia ("putting to sleep")]] if a condition is likely to leave the animal in pain or with a poor quality of life.

==Employment==
The majority of vets are employed in private practice treating animals (75% of vets in the United States, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association).{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} 

Small animal vets typically work in veterinary clinics or veterinary hospitals, or both. Large animal vets often spend more time travelling to see their patients at the primary facilities which house them, such as zoos or farms. 

Other employers include charities treating animals, colleges of veterinary medicine, research laboratories, animal food companies, and [[pharmaceutical companies]].  In many countries, the government may also be a major employer of vets, such as the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] or the [[State Veterinary Service]] in the United Kingdom.  State and local governments also employ veterinarians.<ref>http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos076.htm</ref><ref>http://www.goarmy.com/amedd/vet/index.jsp?bnrcd=C490-ITBP-MCAU-04012008-NA-8021-TEXTAD</ref>

=== Focus of practice===
Vets and their practices may be specialised in certain areas of veterinary medicine.  Areas of focus include:

* [[Exotic animal veterinarian]] - Generally considered to include [[reptile]]s, exotic birds such as [[parrot]]s and [[cockatoo]]s, and small [[mammal]]s such as [[ferret]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[chinchilla]]s, and [[degu]]s.
* [[Conservation medicine]] - The study of the relationship between animal and human health and environmental conditions.
* Small animal practice - Usually [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, and other [[companion animals]]/household pets such as [[hamster]]s and [[gerbil]]s. Some practices are canine-only or feline-only practices.
* [[Laboratory animal]] practice - Some veterinarians work in a [[university]] or industrial laboratory and are responsible for the care and treatment of laboratory animals of any species (often involving [[bovine]]s, [[porcine]] species, felines, canines, [[rodent]]s, and even exotic animals). Their responsibility is not only for the health and well being of the animals, but also for enforcing humane and ethical treatment of the animals in the facility.
* Large animal practice - Usually referring to veterinarians that work with, variously, [[livestock]] and other large farm animals, as well as [[Equus (genus)|equine species]] and large reptiles.
* Equine medicine - Some veterinarians are specialists in equine medicine. Horses are different in [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]], [[pharmacology]], and [[animal husbandry|husbandry]] to other domestic species. Specialization in [[equine]] veterinary practice is something that is normally developed after qualification, even if students do have some interest before graduation.
* Food animal medicine - Some veterinarians deal exclusively or primary with animals raised for food (such as [[meat]], [[milk]], and [[Egg (food)|eggs]]). Livestock practitioners may deal with [[Domestic sheep|ovine]] ([[sheep]]), [[Bovinae|bovine]] ([[cattle]]) and [[Suidae|porcine]] ([[Pig|swine]]) species; such veterinarians deal with management of [[herd]]s, [[nutrition]], [[reproduction]], and minor field surgery. [[Dairy]] medicine practice focuses on dairy animals. [[Poultry]] medicine practice focuses on the health of flocks of poultry; the field often involves extensive training in pathology, epidemiology, and nutrition of [[bird]]s. The veterinarian treats the flock and not the individual animals.
* [[Food safety]] practice - Veterinarians are employed by both the [[food industry]] and [[government agency|government agencies]] to advise on and monitor the handling, preparation, and storage of food in ways that prevent [[foodborne illness]].
* [[Zoological medicine|Wildlife medicine]] - A relatively recent branch of veterinary medicine, focusing on [[wildlife]]. Wildlife medicine veterinarians may work with [[Zoology|zoologists]] and conservation medicine practitioners and may also be called out to treat marine species such as [[sea otter]]s, [[dolphin]]s, or [[whale]]s after a natural disaster or [[oil spill]].

===Veterinary specialities===
{{Main|Veterinary specialities}}
Veterinary specialists are in the minority compared to general practice vets, and tend to be based at points of referral, such as veterinary schools or larger animal hospitals.  Unlike human medicine, veterinary specialities often combine both the surgical and medical aspects of a biological system.

Veterinary specialities are accredited in North America by the AVMA through the American Board of Veterinary Specialties, in Europe by the European Board of Veterinary Specialisation and in Australasia by the Australasian Veterinary Boards Council.  While some vets may have areas of interest outside of recognized specialities, they are not legally specialists.

Specialities can cover from general topics such as [[anaesthesiology]], [[dentistry]], and [[Veterinary surgery|surgery]] to organ system focus such as [[cardiology]] or [[dermatology]].  A full list can be seen at [[veterinary specialties]]

=== Salary ===
The mean salary for new graduates in the United States during 2010 was {{currency|48674}} including nearly 50% going on to advanced study programs.<ref name=avma1yr>[https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/Statistics/Pages/Market-research-statistics-First-year-employment.aspx www.avma.org/1 year employment]</ref> Those not continuing their studies made US$67,359 at first.,<ref name=avma1yr/> whereas vets in the United Kingdom earned slightly less with new graduate wages at an average of £25,000.

The average income for private practice in the United States rose from $105,510 in 2005 to $115,447 in 2007. These increased values exceed those of public practice including [[uniformed services]] and government.<ref>Burns, Katie. "AVMA Survey Measures Income Trends to 2007." AVMA Journals (1 January 2009): Javma News. American Veterinary Medical Association. 2 Mar. 2009 <https://www.avma.org/News/JAVMANews/Pages/090101a.aspx>.</ref> In Australia the profession wide average income was $67,000 in 2011 and this has declined compared to other professions for the past 30 years whilst graduate unemployment has doubled between 2006 and 2011.<ref>White, Tim. "How we make ends meet: economic sustainability of the veterinary profession" Australian Veterinary Journal (April 2012). 18 Apr. 2012 <http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-0813.2012.news_v90_i4.x/abstract>.</ref>

==Education and regulation==
In order to practice, vets must complete both an appropriate [[academic degree|degree]] in [[veterinary medicine]], and in most cases must be registered with the relevant governing body for their jurisdiction.

===Veterinary science degrees===
Degrees in veterinary medicine culminate in the award of a veterinary science degree, although the title varies by region.  For instance, in North America, graduates will receive a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM or VMD) whereas in the United Kingdom or India they would be awarded a [[Bachelor of Veterinary Science|Bachelor's degree in Veterinary Science, Surgery or Medicine]] (BVS, BVSc, BVetMed or BVMS), and in Ireland graduates receive a Medicina Veterinaria Baccalaureate (MVB).

The award of a bachelor's degree was previously commonplace in the United States, but the degree name and academic standards were upgraded to match the 'doctor' title used by graduates.

Comparatively few universities have [[veterinary schools]] that offer degrees which are accredited to qualify the graduates as registered vets.  In the United States, only 28 universities offer a degree meeting [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] (AVMA) standards,<ref>http://www.aavmc.org/students_admissions/vet_schools.htm</ref> in Canada, only 5 veterinary schools offer a vet qualifying course and in the United Kingdom only 7 universities offer a suitable degree.

Due to this scarcity of places for veterinary degrees, admission to veterinary school is competitive and requires extensive preparation.  The likelihood of acceptance is not in favour of the applicant, though is higher than acceptance rates in most academic PhD programs and medical schools.  In the United States in 2007, approximately 5,750 applicants competed for the 2,650 seats in the 28 accredited [[veterinary school]]s, with an acceptance rate of 46%.<ref>Griel, Lester C. "Advising Notes." Division of Undergraduate Studies. 7 Apr. 2008. The Pennsylvania State University. 2 Mar. 2009 <http://www.psu.edu/dus/anvet.htm>.</ref> This compares with acceptance rates of well under 25% for most PhD and MD degrees. 

With competitive admission, many schools may place heavy emphasis and consideration on a candidate's veterinary and animal experience. Formal experience is a particular advantage to the applicant, often consisting of work with veterinarians or scientists in clinics, agribusiness, research, or some area of health science. Less formal experience is also helpful for the applicant to have, and this includes working with animals on a farm or ranch or at a stable or animal shelter and basic overall animal exposure.<ref>{{dead link|date=October 2010}}"Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-09 Edition: Veterinarians." Bureau of Labor Statistics. 18 Dec. 2007. United States Department of Labor. 2 Mar. 2009 <http://www.bls.gov/oco.ocos076.htm></ref>

In the United States, approximately 80% of admitted students are female. In the early history of veterinary medicine of the USA, most veterinarians were males. However, in the 1990s this ratio reached parity, and now it has been reversed.

Preveterinary courses should emphasize the sciences. Most veterinary schools typically require applicants to have taken one year equivalent classes in [[organic chemistry|organic]], [[inorganic chemistry]], [[physics]], [[biology|general biology]]; and one semester of vertebrate embryology and biochemistry. Usually, the minimal mathematics requirement is college level calculus. Individual schools might require introduction to animal science, livestock judging, animal nutrition, cell biology, and genetics. However, due the limited availability of these courses, many schools have removed these requirements to widen the pool of possible applicants.

===Registration and licensing===
Following academic education, most countries require a vet to be registered with the relevant governing body, and to maintain this licence to practice.  

Dependent on where the vet practices (or wishes to practice), they may have to complete an examination or test in order to complete this registration.  For instance, in the United States, a prospective vet must receive a passing grade on a national board examination, the North America Veterinary Licensing Exam.  This exam must be completed over the course of eight hours, and consists of 360 multiple-choice questions, covering all aspects of veterinary medicine, as well as visual material designed to test diagnostic skills.

===Postgraduate study===
The percentage electing to undertake further study following registration in the United States has increased from 36.8% to 39.9% in 2008. About 25% of those or about 9% of graduates were accepted into traditional academic internships. (2008 -696 graduates accepted a position in advanced study, 89.2% (621) accepted an internship (private practice, 74.5%; academic, 25.3%; and other internship, 0.2%). An additional 6.0% (42) accepted a residency). Approximately 9% of veterinarians eventually board certify in one of 20 specialties.<ref name="AVMA">{{cite web|title=Market research statistics|url=https://www.avma.org/kb/resources/statistics/pages/default.aspx/|publisher=AVMA}}</ref><ref name="AVMA1">{{cite web|url=https://www.avma.org/ProfessionalDevelopment/Education/Specialties/pages/recognized-veterinary-specialty-organizations.aspx|publisher=AVMA|title=Recognized Veterinary Specialty Organizations}}</ref>

=== Curriculum comparison with human medicine ===
The first two year curriculum in both veterinary and human medical schools are very similar in the course names, but very different in the content. First two year curriculum usually include biochemistry, physiology, histology, anatomy, pharmacology, microbiology, epidemiology, pathology and hematology.<ref name="cvm.msu.edu">http://cvm.msu.edu/student-information/dvm-program/dvm-curriculum</ref> Some veterinary school uses the same biochemistry, histology, and microbiology books as human medicine students; however, the course content is greatly supplemented to include the varied animal diseases and species specific differences. Many veterinarians were trained in pharmacology using the same text books as human physicians. As the specialty of veterinary pharmacology develop, more schools are using pharmacology textbooks written specifically for veterinarians. Veterinary physiology, anatomy, and histology is complex, as physiology often varies among species. Microbiology and virology of animals share the same foundation as human microbiology, but with grossly different disease manifestation and presentations. Epidemiology is focused on herd health and prevention of herd borne diseases, and foreign animal diseases. Pathology, like microbiology and histology, is very diverse and encompasses many species and organ systems.  Most veterinary school have courses in small animal and also large animal nutrition, often taken as electives in the clinical years or as part of the core curriculum in the first two years.

The last two year curriculum of the two fields are similar only in their clinical emphasis.<ref name="cvm.msu.edu"/> A veterinary student must be well prepared to be a fully functional animal physician on the day of graduation, competent in both surgery and medicine. The graduating veterinarian must be able to pass medical board examination and be prepare to enter clinical practice on the day of graduation, while most human medical doctors in the USA complete 3 to 5 years of post-doctoral residency before practising medicine independently, usually in a very narrow and focused speciality.

==Impact on human medicine==
Some veterinarians pursue post-graduate training and enter research careers and have contributed to advances in many human and veterinary medical fields, including [[pharmacology]] and [[epidemiology]]. Research veterinarians were the first to isolate [[oncovirus]]es, ''[[Salmonella]]'' species, ''[[Brucella]]'' species, and various other [[pathogen]]ic agents. Veterinarians were in the forefront in the effort to suppress [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]] in the United States. Veterinarians identified the [[botulism]] disease-causing agent, produced an [[anticoagulant]] used to treat human [[heart disease]], and developed [[surgery|surgical]] techniques for [[human]]s, such as [[hip replacement|hip-joint replacement]], [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] and [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] [[Organ transplant|transplant]]s.

==In popular culture==
Well-known depictions of a veterinarian at work are in [[James Herriot]]'s ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'', made into a BBC series.

[[Doctor Dolittle]] is a series of children's books, one of which was turned into a [[Doctor Dolittle (film)|1967 movie]]. The movie was [[Dr. Dolittle (film)|remade in 1998]] with [[Eddie Murphy]] as Dr. Dolittle.

US-based [[Cable channel|cable network]] [[Animal Planet]], with animal-based programming, frequently features veterinarians. Two notable shows are ''[[Emergency Vets]]'' and ''[[E-Vet Interns]]'', set at [[Alameda East Veterinary Hospital]] in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]].

The song ''[[Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer]]'', performed by the husband and wife duo "Elmo & Patsy", is a song performed by a veterinarian, ''[[Elmo Shropshire]]'', DVM.

[[Fictional character]] veterinarians in [[TV series]] and films include [[Steve Parker]] in ''[[Neighbours]]'', Jim Hansen in ''[[Providence (TV series)|Providence]]'', and [[Vincent Ventresca]] in the [[horror film]] ''[[Larva (film)|Larva]]''.
In ''[[Beethoven (film)|Beethoven]]'', [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] portrayed Dr. Herman Varnick, an evil veterinarian, with his associates Harvey and Vernon played by [[Oliver Platt]] and [[Stanley Tucci]], who wanted all animals to be destroyed.  They were foiled by the Newton Family and Beethoven.  The Newton Family released other dogs from Dr. Varnick's captives.

The Garfield comic has a vet named Liz.

== Veterinary malpractice ==
Most states in the US allow for malpractice lawsuit in case of death or injury to an animal from professional negligence. Usually the penalty is not greater than the value of the animal. For that reason, malpractice insurance for veterinarians usually is well under $500 a year, compared to an average of over $15000 a year for a human doctor.<ref>http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/43147.php</ref> Some states allow for punitive penalty, loss of companionship, and suffering into the award, likely increasing the cost of veterinary malpractice insurance and the cost of veterinary care. Most veterinarians carry much higher cost business, worker's compensation, and facility insurance to protect their clients and workers from injury inflicted by animals.

==Criticisms==
Concerns about the role of veterinary physicians in helping health threats survive and spread have been raised by several commentators, particularly with respect to pedigree dogs. Koharik Arman (2007) reached the following conclusion for example: "Veterinarians also bear some responsibility for the welfare situation of purebred dogs. In fact, the veterinary profession has facilitated the evolution of purebred dogs. ‘Breeds’ that would not normally be sustainable are propagated by the compliance of veterinarians to breeder wishes.” <ref>{{cite journal|last=Arman|first=Koharik|date=September 2007|title=A new direction for kennel club regulations and breed standards|journal=[[Canadian Veterinary Journal]]|volume=48|pages=953–965|accessdate=9 December 2009|pmc=1950109|pmid=17966340}}</ref> A finding that was echoed by Sir Patrick Bateson in his Independent Review of Dog Breeding following the broadcast of the BBC documentary [[Pedigree Dogs Exposed]]: "Its only the ready availability of modern veterinary medicine that has permitted some conditions…to become widespread.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dogbreedinginquiry.com/publication-of-the-inquiry-report/|title=Independent Inquiry into Dog Breeding|last=Bateson|first=Patrick|date=14 January 2010|accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref> Before one criticizes the veterinary profession on these issues, one needs to understand the make up of the veterinary profession. Veterinarians are as diverse as the general population. Some veterinarians work for and represent the animal industry, some are involved in research using animal as models for human diseases, and some are actively working in protest against the animal industry and facilities that use animals for research. All veterinarians strive to work to improve animal welfare. However, not all veterinarians are all in agreement on all issues concerning animal research, animal husbandry, and animal rights.
