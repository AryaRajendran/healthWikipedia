'''Neurogenic diabetes insipidus''', more commonly known as '''central [[diabetes insipidus]]''', is due to a lack of [[vasopressin]] production in the brain.  Vasopressin acts to increase the volume of blood (intravascularly), and decrease the volume of urine produced. Therefore, a lack of it causes increased urine production and volume depletion.

It is also known as "[[neurohypophyseal]] diabetes insipidus".<ref name="pmid18494865">{{cite journal |author=Chitturi S, Harris M, Thomsett MJ, ''et al'' |title=Utility of AVP gene testing in familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus |journal=Clin.

==Causes==
===Idiopathic===
In at least twenty-five percent of cases (the most commonly occurring classification), neurogenic diabetes insipidus is [[idiopathic]], meaning that the lack of vasopressin production arose from an unknown cause.<ref name="LibNMS">{{Cite document

It is also due to damage of the hypothalamus, pituitary stalk, posterior pituitary, and can arise from head trauma.

===Acquired===
The lack of vasopressin production usually results from some sort of damage to the [[pituitary gland]].  The damage to the brain could have been caused by a benign tumor (20 percent of cases), trauma (17 percent of cases), neurosurgery (9 percent of cases)<ref name="LibNMS"/> or some rather rare causes which include [[hemochromatosis]], [[sarcoidosis]], and [[histiocytosis]].  

Vasopressin is released by the [[posterior pituitary]], but unlike most other pituitary hormones, vasopressin is produced in the [[hypothalamus]]. Neurogenic diabetes insipidus can be a failure of production at the hypothalamus, or a failure of release at the pituitary.<ref name="urlCentral Diabetes Insipidus: Pituitary Gland Disorders: Merck Manual Home Health Handbook">{{cite web |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/hormonal_and_metabolic_disorders/pituitary_gland_disorders/central_diabetes_insipidus.html |title=Central Diabetes Insipidus: Pituitary Gland Disorders: Merck Manual Home Health Handbook |work= |accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref>

===Genetic===
The most rare form of central DI is familial neurogenic diabetes insipidus.  This form of DI is due to an inherited mutation of the [[arginine vasopressin-neurophysin II]] (AVP-NPII) gene, inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.<ref>{{Cite document

==Treatment==
The disorder is treated with vasopressin analogs such as [[Desmopressin]].
