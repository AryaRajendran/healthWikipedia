The '''health effects of the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear accident]]''' are widely, but not universally, agreed to be very low level. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}
According to the official radiation release figures, average local radiation exposure was equivalent to a chest X-ray, and maximum local exposure equivalent to less than a year's background radiation. Local activism based on anecdotal reports of negative health effects led to scientific studies being commissioned. A variety of studies have been unable to conclude that the accident had substantial health effects, but a debate remains about some key data (such as the amount of radiation released, and where it went) and gaps in the literature. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Initial investigations==
In the aftermath of the accident, investigations focused on the amount of radiation released by the accident. The official figures have been disputed by a number of insiders, who have suggested figures hundreds or thousands of times higher (see [[Three Mile Island accident#Radiation release]]). According to the [[American Nuclear Society]], using the relatively low official radiation emission figures, "The average radiation dose to people living within ten miles of the plant was eight [[millirem]], and no more than 100 millirem to any single individual. Eight millirem is about equal to a chest [[X-ray]], and 100 millirem is about a third of the average background level of radiation received by US residents in a year.".<ref name=ANS>{{Cite web

Sternglass|Ernest Sternglass]], a specialist in [[Ionizing radiation|low-level radiation]], noted these statistics in the 1981 edition of his book ''Secret Fallout: low-level radiation from Hiroshima to Three-Mile Island''. In their final 1981 report, however, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, examining death rates within the 10-mile area around TMI for the 6 months after the accident, said that the TMI-2 accident did not cause local deaths of infants or fetuses.<ref>{{cite web

Scientific work continued in the 1980s, but focused heavily on the mental health effects due to stress,<ref name=mangano2004/> as the [[Kemeny Commission]] had concluded that this was the sole public health effect.<ref name="hatch"/> A 1984 survey by a local psychologist of 450 local residents, documenting acute radiation health effects (as well as 19 cancers 1980-84 amongst the residents against an expected 2.6<ref name=wing03/>), ultimately led the TMI Public Health Fund reviewing the data<ref>Moholdt B.

==Columbia epidemiological study==
In 1990-1 a [[Columbia University]] team, led by [[Maureen Hatch]], carried out the first epidemiological study on local death rates before and after the accident, for the period 1975-1985, for the 10-mile area around TMI.<ref name="hatch">{{cite journal

===Wing review===
Subsequently lawyers for 2000 residents asked epidemiologist Stephen Wing of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], a specialist in nuclear radiation exposure, to re-examine the Columbia study. Wing was reluctant to get involved, later writing that "allegations of high radiation doses at TMI were considered by mainstream radiation scientists to be a product of [[radiation phobia]] or efforts to extort money from a blameless industry."<ref name=wing03/> Wing later noted that in order to obtain the relevant data, the Columbia study had to submit to what Wing called "a manipulation of research" in the form of a court order which prohibited "upper limit or worst case estimates of releases of radioactivity or population doses... [unless] such estimates would lead to a mathematical projection of less than 0.01 health effects."<ref name=wing03/> Wing found cancer rates raised within a 10-mile radius two years after the accident by 0.034% +/- 0.013%, 0.103% +/- 0.035%, and 0.139% +/- 0.073% for all cancer, lung cancer, and leukemia, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal

==Further studies==
On the recommendation of the Columbia team, the TMI Public Health Fund followed up its work with a longitudinal study.<ref name=hatch97/> The 2000-3 [[University of Pittsburgh]] study<ref name=talbott>Evelyn O. Talbott et al., “Mortality Among the Residents of the Three Mile Accident Area: 1979–1992,”  Environmental Health Perspectives, vol. 108, no. 6, pp. 545–52 (2000); Evelyn O.  Talbott et al., “Long-Term Follow-up of the Residents of the Three Mile Island Accident,” Environmental Health Perspectives, vol. 111, no. 3, pp.341–48 (2003)</ref> compared post-TMI death rates in different parts of the local area, again using the wind direction on the morning of 28 March to assign fallout impact, even though, according to Joseph Mangano in the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'', the areas of lowest fallout by this criterion had the highest mortality rates.<ref name=mangano2004/>{{Verify credibility|date=July 2009}} In contrast to the Columbia study, which estimated exposure in 69 areas, the Pittsburgh study drew on the TMI Population Registry, compiled by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. This was based on radiation exposure information on 93% of the population living within five miles of the nuclear plant - nearly 36,000 people, gathered in door-to-door surveys shortly after the accident.<ref>Holzman (2003), [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1241416&blobtype=pdf "Cancer and three mile island"], ''Environmental health perspectives'', vol:111 iss:3 pg:A166 -A167</ref> The study found slight increases in cancer and mortality rates but "no consistent evidence" of causation by TMI.<ref name=talbott/> Wing et al. criticized the Pittsburgh study for making the same assumption as Columbia: that the official statistics on low doses of radiation were correct - leading to a study "in which the null hypothesis cannot be rejected due to a priori assumptions."<ref>Wing, S. and Richardson, D.

In 2005 [[R. William Field]], an epidemiologist at the [[University of Iowa]], who first described radioactive contamination of the wild food chain from the accident{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} suggested that some of the increased cancer rates noted around TMI were related to the area's very high levels of natural [[radon]], noting that according to a 1994 EPA study, the Pennsylvania counties around TMI have the highest regional screening radon concentrations in the 38 states surveyed.<ref>R. W. Field (2005), [http://rpd.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/113/2/214 "Three Mile Island epidemiologic radiation dose assessment revisited: 25 years after the accident"], Radiation Protection Dosimetry 113 (2), pp. 214-217</ref> The factor had also been considered by the Pittsburgh study<ref name=talbott/> and by the Columbia team, which had noted that "rates of childhood leukemia in the Three Mile Island area are low compared with national and regional rates."<ref name=hatch90/> A 2006 study on the standard [[mortality rate]] in children in 34 counties downwind of TMI found an increase in the rate (for cancers other than leukemia) from 0.83 (1979–83) to 1.17 (1984–88), meaning a rise from below the national average to above it.<ref name=mangano06/>

A paper in 2008 studying [[thyroid cancer]] in the region found rates as expected in the county in which the reactor is located, and significantly higher than expected rates in two neighboring counties beginning in 1990 and 1995 respectively. The research notes that "These findings, however, do not provide a causal link to the TMI accident."<ref>RJ Levin (2008), "Incidence of thyroid cancer in residents surrounding the three mile island nuclear facility", Laryngoscope 118 (4), pp. 618-628</ref> According to Joseph Mangano (who is a member of The [[Radiation and Public Health Project]], an organization with little credibility amongst epidemiologists,<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/11/nyregion/baby-teeth-test-fallout-long-shot-search-for-nuclear-peril-molars-cuspids.html</ref>) three large gaps in the literature include: no study has focused on infant mortality data, or on data from outside the 10-mile zone, or on radioisotopes other than iodine, krypton, and xenon.<ref name=mangano2004/>
