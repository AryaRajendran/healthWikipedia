Medical Technology, which is a proper subset of health technology, encompasses a wide range of [[healthcare]] products and is used to diagnose, monitor or treat diseases or medical conditions affecting [[human]]s. Such technologies (applications of [[medical science]]) are intended to improve the quality of healthcare delivered through earlier [[diagnosis]], less invasive [[Therapy|treatment]] options and reductions in [[hospital]] stays and [[rehabilitation medicine|rehabilitation]] times.<ref>{{cite web | author=ADVAMED (Advanced Medical Technology Association). | title=What is Medical Technology?. | url=http://www.advamed.org/MemberPortal/About/NewsRoom/MediaKits/whatismedtechnology.htm| date=June 8, 2009 | publisher=ADVAMED}}</ref> Recent advances in medical technology have also focused on cost reduction. Medical technology may broadly include [[medical devices]], [[information technology]], [[biotech]], and healthcare services.

==Definition of Medical Technology==
{{Quote|Medical Technology extends and improves life. It alleviates pain, injury and handicap. Its role in healthcare is essential. Incessant medical technology innovation enhances the quality and effectiveness of care. Billions of patients worldwide depend on medical technology at home, at the doctorâ€™s, at hospital and in nursing homes. Wheelchairs, pacemakers, orthopedic shoes, spectacles and contact lenses, insulin pens, hip prostheses, condoms, oxygen masks, dental floss, MRI scanners, pregnancy tests, surgical instruments, bandages, syringes, life-support machines: more than 500,000 products (10,000 generic groups) are available today. Medical technology represents only 6,3% of total healthcare expenditure in Europe - a modest share if you consider the benefits for every member of society.<ref>[http://www.eucomed.be/~/media/pdf/tl/2008/portal/aboutindustry/medtechbrief2007.ashx EUCOMED Medical Technology brief]</ref>| '''[[Eucomed]]'''.}}
