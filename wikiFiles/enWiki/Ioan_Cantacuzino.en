'''Ioan C. Cantacuzino''' ({{IPA-ro|iˈo̯an kantakuziˈno}}, also '''Ion Cantacuzino'''; November 25, 1863 – January 14, 1934) was a renowned [[Romania]]n [[physician]] and [[bacteriologist]], a professor at the [[Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy|Romanian School of Medicine and Pharmacy]] and a member of the [[Romanian Academy]]. He was the founder of the fields of [[microbiology]] and [[Medical research|experimental medicine]] in Romania, and creator of the [[Ioan Cantacuzino Institute]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Bucharest]] as a member of the [[Cantacuzino family]], he graduated from the [[University of Paris]]' Faculty of Sciences and Faculty of Medicine, and worked at several hospitals in [[Paris]], obtaining his [[doctorate]] in 1894. Later in the same year, he began his academic career as a deputy professor at the [[University of Iaşi]], and returned to Paris after two years to serve on the staff of the [[Pasteur Institute]], where he worked under the direction of [[Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov]].

In 1901, Cantacuzino was assigned a teaching position in Bucharest, where he became a major influence on a generation of scientists. His discoveries were relevant in the treatment of [[cholera]], [[epidemic typhus]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[scarlet fever]]. As a disciple of Mechnikov, he devoted part of his research to expanding on the latter's field of interest ([[phagocyte]]s, the body's [[Immune system|means of defence]] against [[pathogen]]s, as well as the issue of immunity and [[invertebrate]]s). He invented the notion of ''[[contact immunity]]''.

During the [[Second Balkan War]], Cantacuzino was appointed head of the staff combatting the cholera [[epidemic]] in the ranks of the [[Romanian Army]] stationed in [[Dobruja]]; he was assigned to the same position during the [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|Romanian campaign]] in [[World War I]], in the fight against typhus. He founded and led the scientific magazines ''Revista Ştiinţelor Medicale'' and ''Archives roumaines de pathologie expérimentale'', and regularly contributed to the [[literary magazine]] ''[[Viața Românească]]'' (replacing [[Paul Bujor]] on the editorial board).<ref>Stere, p.13</ref> A collaborator of [[Constantin Stere]], he was noted as a [[Poporanism|Poporanist]] disciple of [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]].<ref>Vulcănescu</ref>
