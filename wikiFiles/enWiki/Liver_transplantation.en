'''Liver transplantation''' or '''hepatic transplantation''' is the replacement of a diseased [[liver]] with a healthy liver from another person ([[allograft]]). The most commonly used technique is orthotopic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic location as the original liver. Liver transplantation is a viable treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. Typically three surgeons and two anesthesiologists are involved, with up to four supporting nurses. The surgical procedure is very demanding and ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome. Numerous [[anastomoses#Medicine|anastomoses]] and sutures, and many disconnections and reconnections of abdominal and hepatic tissue, must be made for the transplant to succeed, requiring an eligible recipient and a well-calibrated live or cadaveric donor match. By any standard, hepatic transplantation is a major surgical procedure with an appreciable degree of risk.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==History==
The first [[human]] liver transplant was performed in 1963 by a surgical team led by Dr. [[Thomas Starzl]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Starzl T, Marchioro T, VonKaulla K, Hermann G, Brittain R, Waddell W |title=Homotransplantation of the Liver in Humans |journal=Surg Gynecol Obstet |volume=117 |pages=659–76 |year= 1963|pmid=14100514 |pmc=2634660}}</ref> of [[Denver, Colorado]], [[United States]]. Dr. Starzl performed several additional transplants over the next few years before the first short-term success was achieved in 1967 with the first one-year survival post transplantation. Despite the development of viable surgical techniques, liver transplantation remained experimental through the 1970s, with one year patient survival in the vicinity of 25%. The introduction of [[cyclosporin]] by Sir [[Roy Calne]] markedly improved patient outcomes, and the 1980s saw recognition of liver transplantation as a standard clinical treatment for both adult and pediatric patients with appropriate indications.<ref>{{cite journal |doi = 10.1056/NEJM198107303050507 |author = Starzl TE, Klintmalm GB, Porter KA, Iwatsuki S, Schroter GP |title=Liver Transplantation with use of Cyclosporin A and Prednisone |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=305 |year=1981 |pages=266–9 |pmid=7017414 |issue = 5 |pmc = 2772056}}</ref>  Liver transplantation is now performed at over one hundred centers in the [[USA]], as well as numerous centres in Europe and elsewhere.  One-year patient survival is 80–85%, and outcomes continue to improve, although liver transplantation remains a formidable procedure with frequent complications.  However, the supply of [[liver]] [[allograft]]s from non-living donors is far short of the number of potential recipients, a reality that has spurred the development of [[#Living donor transplantation|living donor liver transplantation]].

==Indications==
Liver transplantation is potentially applicable to any acute or chronic condition resulting in irreversible liver dysfunction, provided that the recipient does not have other conditions that will preclude a successful transplant. Uncontrolled metastatic cancer outside liver, active drug or alcohol abuse and active septic infections are absolute contraindications. While infection with HIV was once considered an [[absolute contraindication]], this has been changing recently. Advanced age and serious heart, pulmonary or other disease may also prevent transplantation ([[relative contraindication]]s). Most liver transplants are performed for chronic liver diseases that lead to irreversible scarring of the liver, or [[cirrhosis of the liver]]. Some centers use the [[Milan criteria]] to select patients with liver cancers for liver transplantation.

==Techniques==
Before transplantation, liver-support therapy might be indicated (bridging-to-transplantation). Artificial liver support like [[liver dialysis]] or bioartificial liver support concepts are currently under preclinical and clinical evaluation.
Virtually all liver transplants are done in an orthotopic fashion, that is, the native liver is removed and the new liver is placed in the same anatomic location.  The transplant operation can be conceptualized as consisting of the hepatectomy (liver removal) phase, the anhepatic (no liver) phase, and the postimplantation phase.  The operation is done through a large incision in the upper abdomen.  The hepatectomy involves division of all ligamentous attachments to the liver, as well as the common bile duct, hepatic artery, hepatic vein and portal vein.  Usually, the retrohepatic portion of the inferior vena cava is removed along with the liver, although an alternative technique preserves the recipient's vena cava ("piggyback" technique).

The donor's blood in the liver will be replaced by an ice-cold organ storage solution, such as UW ([[Viaspan]]) or  [[Histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate|HTK]] until the allograft liver is implanted.  Implantation involves anastomoses (connections) of the inferior vena cava, portal vein, and hepatic artery.  After blood flow is restored to the new liver, the biliary (bile duct) anastomosis is constructed, either to the recipient's own bile duct or to the small intestine.  The surgery usually takes between five and six hours, but may be longer or shorter due to the difficulty of the operation and the experience of the surgeon.

The large majority of liver transplants use the entire liver from a non-living donor for the transplant, particularly for adult recipients.  A major advance in pediatric liver transplantation was the development of reduced size liver transplantation, in which a portion of an adult liver is used for an infant or small child.  Further developments in this area included split liver transplantation, in which one liver is used for transplants for two recipients, and living donor liver transplantation, in which a portion of a healthy person's liver is removed and used as the allograft.  Living donor liver transplantation for pediatric recipients involves removal of approximately 20% of the liver ([[Couinaud]] segments 2 and 3).

Further advance in liver transplant involves only  resection of the lobe of the liver involved in tumors and the tumor-free lobe remains within the recipient. This speeds up the recovery and the patient stay in the hospital quickly shortens to within 5–7 days.

Many major medical centers are now using radiofrequency ablation of the liver tumor as a bridge while awaiting for liver transplantation. This technique has not been used universally and further investigation is warranted.

==Immunosuppressive management==
Like most other allografts, a liver transplant will be [[Transplant rejection|rejected]] by the recipient unless [[Immunosuppression|immunosuppressive]] drugs are used.  The immunosuppressive regimens for all solid organ transplants are fairly similar, and a variety of agents are now available.  Most liver transplant recipients receive [[corticosteroid]]s plus a calcineurin inhibitor such as [[tacrolimus]] or [[ciclosporin]] plus a purine antagonist such as [[Mycophenolic acid|mycophenolate mofetil]]. Clinical outcome is better with [[tacrolimus]] than with [[cyclosporin]] during the first year of liver transplantation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Haddad EM, McAlister VC, Renouf E, Malthaner R, Kjaer MS, Gluud LL |title=Cyclosporin versus tacrolimus for liver transplanted patients |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD005161 |year=2006 |pmid=17054241 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005161.pub2 |url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&context=surgerypub}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=J.G. O'Grady, A. Burroughs, P. Hardy, D. Elbourne, A. Truesdale, and The UK and Ireland Liver Transplant Study Group | title=Tacrolimus versus emulsified cyclosporin in liver transplantation: the TMC randomised controlled trial | journal=Lancet | volume=360 | pages=1119–25 | year=2002 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)11196-2 | pmid=12387959 | issue=9340}}</ref> If the patient has a co-morbidity such as active hepatitis B, high doses of hepatitis B immunoglubins are administrated in liver transplant patients.
Liver transplantation is unique in that the risk of chronic rejection also decreases over time, although the great majority of recipients need to take immunosuppressive medication for the rest of their lives.  It is possible to be slowly taken off anti rejection medication but only in certain cases. It is theorized that the liver may play a yet-unknown role in the maturation of certain cells pertaining to the [[immune system]]. There is at least one study by Dr. Starzl's team at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] which consisted of [[bone marrow]] [[biopsies]] taken from such patients which demonstrate genotypic [[chimerism]] in the bone marrow of liver transplant recipients.

==Graft rejection==
After a liver transplantation, there are three types of graft rejection that may occur. They include hyperacute rejection, acute rejection and chronic rejection. Hyperacute rejection is caused by preformed anti-donor antibodies. It is characterized by the binding of these antibodies to antigens on vascular endothelial cells. [[Complement system|Complement activation]] is involved and the effect is usually profound. Hyperacute rejection happens within minutes to hours after the transplant procedure. Unlike hyperacute rejection, which is B cell mediated, acute rejection is mediated by T cells. It involves direct cytotoxicity and cytokine mediated pathways. Acute rejection is the most common and the primary target of immunosuppressive agents. Acute rejection is usually seen within days or weeks of the transplant. Chronic rejection is the presence of any sign and symptom of rejection after 1 year. The cause of chronic rejection is still unknown but an acute rejection is a strong predictor of chronic rejections.
Liver rejection may happen anytime after the transplant.      Lab findings of a liver rejection include abnormal AST, ALT, GGT and liver function values such as prothrombin time, ammonia level, bilirubin level, albumin concentration, and blood glucose. Physical findings include encephalopathy, jaundice, bruising and bleeding tendency. Other nonspecific presentation are malaise, anorexia, muscle ache, low fever, slight increase in white blood count and graft tender.

==Results==
Prognosis is quite good. However, those with certain illnesses may differ.<ref>http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/medicine_health/report-22829.html</ref> There is no exact model to predict survival rates; however, those with transplant have a 58% chance of surviving 15 years.<ref>https://www.uktransplant.org.uk/ukt/statistics/presentations/pdfs/april_05/liver_life_expectancy.pdf</ref> Failure of the new liver occurs in 10% to 15% of all cases. These percentages are contributed to by many complications. Early graft failure is probably due to preexisting disease of the donated organ. Others include technical flaws during surgery such as revascularization that may lead to a nonfunctioning graft.

==Living donor transplantation==
[[File:LDLT volume measure.jpg|thumb|Volume rendering image created with [[computed tomography]], which can be used to evaluate the volume of the liver of a potential donor.]]
'''Living donor liver transplantation''' (LDLT) has emerged in recent decades as a critical [[Surgery|surgical]] option for patients with end stage liver disease, such as [[cirrhosis]] and/or [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] often attributable to one or more of the following: long-term [[Alcoholism|alcohol abuse]], long-term untreated [[hepatitis C]] infection, long-term untreated [[hepatitis B]] infection. The concept of LDLT is based on (1) the remarkable regenerative capacities of the human liver and (2) the widespread shortage of [[cadaver]]ic livers for patients awaiting [[Organ transplant|transplant]]. In LDLT, a piece of healthy liver is surgically removed from a living person and transplanted into a recipient, immediately after the recipient’s diseased liver has been entirely removed.

Historically, LDLT began as a means for parents of children with severe liver disease to donate a portion of their healthy liver to replace their child's entire damaged liver. The first report of successful LDLT was by Dr. [[Christoph Broelsch]] at the [[University of Chicago Medical Center]] in November 1989, when two-year-old Alyssa Smith received a portion of her mother's liver.<ref>http://www.uchicagokidshospital.org/specialties/transplant/patient-stories/alyssa-liver.html</ref> Surgeons eventually realized that adult-to-adult LDLT was also possible, and now the practice is common in a few reputable medical institutes. It is considered more technically demanding than even standard, cadaveric donor liver transplantation, and also poses the ethical problems underlying the indication of a major surgical operation ([[hemihepatectomy]] or related procedure) on a healthy human being. In various case series, the risk of complications in the donor is around 10%, and very occasionally a second operation is needed. Common problems are [[biliary fistula]], [[gastric stasis]] and [[infection]]s; they are more common after removal of the right lobe of the liver. Death after LDLT has been reported at 0% (Japan), 0.3% (USA) and <1% (Europe), with risks likely to decrease further as surgeons gain more experience in this procedure.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Umeshita K, Fujiwara K, Kiyosawa K, ''et al.'' |title=Operative morbidity of living liver donors in Japan |journal=Lancet |volume=362 |issue=9385 |pages=687–90 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12957090 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14230-4}}</ref>

In a typical adult recipient LDLT, 55 to 70% of the liver (the right lobe) is removed from a healthy living donor. The donor's liver will regenerate approaching 100% function within 4–6 weeks, and will almost reach full volumetric size with recapitulation of the normal structure soon thereafter. It may be possible to remove up to 70% of the liver from a healthy living donor without harm in most cases. The transplanted portion will reach full function and the appropriate size in the recipient as well, although it will take longer than for the donor. [http://www.reachmd.com/xmsegment.aspx?sid=1675]

Living donors are faced with risks and/or complications after the surgery. Blood clots and biliary problems have the possibility of arising in the donor post-op, but these issues are remedied fairly easily. Although death is a risk that a living donor must be willing to accept prior to the surgery, the mortality rate of living donors in the United States is low. The LDLT donor's immune system does diminish as a result of the liver regenerating, so certain foods which would normally cause an upset stomach could cause serious illness.

===Liver donor requirements===
[[File:LDLTA.jpg|thumb|[[CT scan]] performed for evaluation of a potential donor. The image shows an unusual variation of hepatic artery. The left hepatic artery supplies not only left lobe but also segment 8. The anatomy makes right lobe donation impossible. Even used as left lobe or lateral segment donation, it would be very technically challenging in anastomosing the small arteries.]]
Any member of the family, parent, sibling, child, spouse or a volunteer can donate their liver.  The criteria for a liver donation include:

*Being in good health
*Having a [[blood type]] that matches or is compatible with the recipient's
*Having a charitable desire of donation without financial motivation
*Being between 18 and 60 years old
*Being of similar or bigger size than the recipient
*Before one becomes a living donor, the donor must undergo testing to ensure that the individual is physically fit. Sometimes CT scans or MRIs are done to image the liver. In most cases, the work up is done in 2–3 weeks <ref ="Who can be a Donor? - University of Maryland Medical Center">[http://www.umm.edu/transplant/liver_donor.htm Who can be a Donor? - University of Maryland Medical Center], Retrieved on 2010-01-20.</ref>

===Complications===

Living donor surgery is done at a major center. Very few individuals require any [[blood transfusions]] during or after surgery.  All potential donors should know there is a 0.5 to 1.0 percent chance of death. Other risks of donating a liver include bleeding, infection, painful incision, possibility of [[blood clots]] and a prolonged recovery.<ref name="Liver Transplant">[http://www.emedicinehealth.com/liver_transplant/article_em.htm Liver Transplant], Retrieved on 2010-01-20.</ref> The vast majority of donors enjoy complete and full recovery within 2–3 months.

===Pediatric transplantation===

In children, living liver donor transplantations have become very accepted. The accessibility of adult parents who want to donate a piece of the liver for their children/infants has reduced the number of children who would have otherwise died waiting for a transplant. Having a parent as a donor also has made it a lot easier for children - because both patients are in the same hospital and can help boost each other's morale.<ref name="What I need to know about Liver Transplantation">[http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/livertransplant_ez/index.htm hat I need to know about Liver Transplantation], National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse (NDDIC), Retrieved on 2010-01-20.</ref>

===Benefits===

There are several advantages of living liver donor transplantation over cadaveric donor transplantation, including:

*Transplant can be done on an elective basis because the donor is readily available
*There are fewer possibilities for complications and death while waiting for a cadaveric organ donor
*Because of donor shortages, [[UNOS]] has placed limits on cadaveric organ allocation to foreigners who seek medical help in the USA. However, with the availability of living donor transplantation, this will now allow foreigners a new opportunity to seek medical care in the USA

===Screening for donors===

Living donor transplantation is a multidisciplinary approach. All living liver donors undergo medical evaluation. Every hospital which performs transplants has dedicated nurses that provide specific information about the procedure and answer questions that families may have. During the evaluation process, confidentiality is assured on the potential donor. Every effort is made to ensure that organ donation is not made by coercion from other family members. The transplant team provides both the donor and family thorough counseling and support which continues until full recovery is made.<ref name="Liver Donor: All you need to know">[http://www.donorliver.com/ Liver Donor: All you need to know], Retrieved on 2010-01-20.</ref>

All donors are assessed medically to ensure that they can undergo the surgery. Blood type of the donor and recipient must be compatible but not always identical. Other things assessed prior to surgery include the anatomy of the donor liver. However, even with mild variations in [[blood vessels]] and [[bile duct]], surgeons today are able to perform transplantation without problems. The most important criterion for a living liver donor is to be in excellent health.<ref name="Liver Transplant Program And Center for Liver Disease">[http://www.surgery.usc.edu/divisions/hep/pediatricsurgeryandtransplant.html Liver Transplant Program And Center for Liver Disease], University of Southern California Department of Surgery, Retrieved on 2010-01-20.</ref>

==Controversy over eligibility for alcoholics==
 {{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
The high incidence of liver transplants given to those with [[alcoholic]] [[cirrhosis]] has led to a recurring controversy regarding the eligibility of such patients for liver transplant. The controversy stems from the view of [[alcoholism]] as a self-inflicted disease and the perception that those with alcohol-induced damage are depriving other patients who could be considered more deserving.<ref>http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mouse-man/200902/do-alcoholics-deserve-liver-transplants</ref>

==Preservation of the liver before transplantation==
The OrganOx Metra device is capable of maintaining the liver outside of the body for longer periods than traditional preservation of the organ on ice (which usually can only be done for about 12 hours- 20 at most- before it is damaged unfit for transplantation). The device, which was invented and tested (in two liver transplantations at the hospital) by a team from [[Oxford University]] and [[King's College Hospital]], could be ready for use in 2014 after a pilot trial of 20 more transplantations.<ref>http://vitals.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/15/17327760-liver-kept-alive-outside-body-in-medical-first?lite</ref>
