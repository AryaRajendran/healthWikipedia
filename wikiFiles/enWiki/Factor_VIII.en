'''Factor VIII''' (FVIII) is an essential [[thrombus|blood-clot]]ting [[protein]], also known as anti-hemophilic factor (AHF). In humans, factor VIII is encoded by the ''F8'' [[gene]].<ref name="pmid6438528">{{cite journal | author = Toole JJ, Knopf JL, Wozney JM, Sultzman LA, Buecker JL, Pittman DD, Kaufman RJ, Brown E, Shoemaker C, Orr EC | title = Molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding human antihaemophilic factor | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5992 | pages = 342–7 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6438528 | doi = 10.1038/312342a0| url = | issn = }}</ref><ref name="pmid3935400">{{cite journal | author = Truett MA, Blacher R, Burke RL, Caput D, Chu C, Dina D, Hartog K, Kuo CH, Masiarz FR, Merryweather JP | title = Characterization of the polypeptide composition of human factor VIII:C and the nucleotide sequence and expression of the human kidney cDNA | journal = DNA | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 333–49 | year = 1985 | month = October | pmid = 3935400 | doi = 10.1089/dna.1985.4.333| url = | issn = }}</ref> Defects in this gene results in [[hemophilia A]], a [[Dominance_(genetics)#Recessive_trait|recessive]] X-linked coagulation disorder.<ref name="pmid8578479">{{cite journal | author = Antonarakis SE | title = Molecular genetics of coagulation factor VIII gene and hemophilia A | journal = Thromb.

Factor VIII participates in [[blood coagulation]]; it is a cofactor for [[factor IX]]a which, in the presence of Ca<sup>+2</sup> and [[phospholipid]]s forms a complex that converts [[factor X]] to the activated form Xa. The factor VIII gene produces two alternatively spliced transcripts. Transcript variant 1 encodes a large [[glycoprotein]], isoform a, which circulates in plasma and associates with [[von Willebrand factor]] in a noncovalent complex. This protein undergoes multiple cleavage events. Transcript variant 2 encodes a putative small protein, isoform b, which consists primarily of the phospholipid binding domain of factor VIIIc. This binding domain is essential for coagulant activity.<ref name = "entrez">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: F8 coagulation factor VIII, procoagulant component (hemophilia A)| url =http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=2157| accessdate = }}</ref>

==Genetics==
The gene for factor VIII is located on the [[X chromosome]] (Xq28). The gene for factor VIII presents an interesting primary structure, as another gene is embedded in one of its [[intron]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Levinson B, Kenwrick S, Lakich D, Hammonds G, Gitschier J |title=A transcribed gene in an intron of the human factor VIII gene |journal=Genomics |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |year=1990 |pmid=2110545|doi=10.1016/0888-7543(90)90512-S}}</ref>

==Physiology==
FVIII is a [[glycoprotein]] pro[[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]].  Although the primary site of release in humans is ambiguous, it is synthesized and released into the bloodstream by the vascular, glomerular, and tubular [[endothelium]], and the [[Sinusoid (blood vessel)|sinusoidal cells]] of the [[liver]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Kumar, Abbas, Fausto |title=Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |publisher=Elsevier |location=Pennsylvania |year=2005 |pages=655 |isbn=1-889325-04-X |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> [[Hemophilia A]] has been corrected by liver [[organ transplant|transplantation]].<ref name="Williams2010-8">Kaushansky K, Lichtman M, Beutler E, Kipps T, Prchal J, Seligsohn U. (2010; edition 8) ''Williams Hematology''. McGraw-Hill. ISBN 978-0-07-162151-9</ref> Transplanting [[hepatocyte]]s was ineffective, but liver endothelial cells were effective.<ref name="Williams2010-8"/>

In the blood, it mainly circulates in a stable [[Noncovalent bonding|
noncovalent]] complex with [[von Willebrand factor]]. Upon activation by [[thrombin]], (factor IIa), it dissociates from the complex to interact with [[factor IX]]a in the [[coagulation#The_coagulation_cascade|coagulation cascade]]. It is a cofactor to [[factor IX]]a in the activation of [[factor X]], which, in turn, with its cofactor [[factor V]]a, activates more thrombin. Thrombin cleaves [[fibrin]]ogen into [[fibrin]] which [[polymer]]izes and crosslinks (using [[factor XIII]]) into a blood clot.

No longer protected by vWF, activated FVIII is [[proteolysis|proteolytically]] inactivated in the process (most prominently by activated [[protein C]] and [[factor IX]]a) and quickly cleared from the blood stream.

Factor VIII is not affected by liver disease. In fact, levels usually are elevated in such instances.<ref>{{cite book |author=R. Rubin, L. Leopold |title=Hematologic Pathophysiology |publisher=Fence Creek Publishing |location=Madison, Conn |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=1-889325-04-X |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>

==Therapeutic use==
{{anchor|concentrate}}
FVIII concentrated from donated blood plasma ([[Aafact]] or Alphanate, Monoclate-P®), or alternatively [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] FVIII can be given to [[hemophiliac]]s to restore [[hemostasis]].

The transfer of a [[Blood plasma|plasma]] byproduct into the blood stream of a patient with hemophilia often led to the transmission of diseases such as [[hepatitis B]] and [[hepatitis C|C]] and [[HIV]] before purification methods were improved. 

Antibody formation to factor VIII can also be a major concern for patients receiving therapy against bleeding; the incidence of these inhibitors is dependent of various factors, including the factor VIII product itself.<ref name="urlOverview of Factor VIII Inhibitors">{{cite web | url = http://www.cmeonhemophilia.com/pub/overview.of.factor.viii.inhibitors.php | title = Overview of Factor VIII Inhibitors | author = Lozier J | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2004 | format = | work = | publisher = CMEonHemophilia.com | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-01-07}}</ref>

==Contamination scandal==
{{Main|Contaminated haemophilia blood products}}In the 1980s, some pharmaceutical companies such as [[Bayer]] sparked controversy by continuing to sell [[Contaminated haemophilia blood products|contaminated factor VIII]] after new heat-treated versions were available.<ref name="NYT2003">{{cite web | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E4DA1F3EF931A15756C0A9659C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1=2157 | title = 2 Paths of Bayer Drug in 80's: Riskier One Steered Overseas | author = Bogdanich W, Koli E | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2003-05-22 | format = | work = | publisher = The New York Times | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-01-07}}</ref> Under FDA pressure, unheated product was pulled from US markets, but was sold to Asian, Latin American, and some European countries. The product was tainted with HIV, a concern that had been discussed by Bayer and the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).<ref name="NYT2003"/>  There was an impression of protecting the companies' monetary profits at the cost of infecting large numbers of hemophiliacs with HIV.

In the early 1990s, pharmaceutical companies began to produce [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] synthesized factor products, which now prevent nearly all forms of disease transmission during replacement therapy.
