'''Mad Pride''' is a mass movement of [[mental health]] services, users, and their allies. The first known event specifically organized as a Pride event by people who identify as psychiatric survivors/consumer/ex-patients was in Toronto, Canada when it was called "Psychiatric Survivor Pride Day", held on September 18, 1993. It was first held in response to local community prejudices towards people with a psychiatric history living in boarding homes in the Parkdale area of the city, and has been held every year since then in this city except 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csinfo.ca/bulletin.html  |first=Geoffrey |last=Reaume |title=A History of Psychiatric Survivor Pride Day during the 1990s |publisher=The Consumer/Survivor Information Resource Centre Bulletin, No. 374 |date=July 14, 2008}}</ref> By the late 1990s similar events were being organized as Mad Pride in London, England and around the globe from [[Australia]] to [[South Africa]] and the [[United States]], drawing thousands of participants, according to [[MindFreedom International]], a United States mental health advocacy organization that promotes and tracks events spawned by the movement.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html?partner=rssnyt 'Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma]</ref>

Mad Pride activists seek to reclaim terms such as "[[Insanity|mad]]", "nutter" and "[[psychosis|psycho]]" from misuse, such as in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspapers.  Through a series of [[mass media]] campaigns, Mad Pride activists seek to re-educate the general public on such subjects as the causes of [[mental disorder]]s, the experiences of those using the mental health system, and the global [[suicide]] pandemic.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  One of Mad Pride's founding activists was [[Pete Shaughnessy]], who later committed suicide.<ref>[http://www.mentalmagazine.co.uk/pete_shaughnessy.htm#petemain Pete Shaughnessy r.i.p.]</ref>  Robert Dellar and "Freaky Phil" Murphy were among the other founders of the movement.

== History ==
Mad Pride was launched alongside a book of the same name, ''Mad Pride:  A celebration of mad culture'', published in 2000.<ref name="Mad Pride"/>  On May 11, 2008, Gabrielle Glaser documented Mad Pride in [[The New York Times]].<ref name="'Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma">Author: Gabrielle Glaser.

The Mad Pride movement has spawned recurring cultural events in [[Toronto]], [[London]], and other cities around the world.
