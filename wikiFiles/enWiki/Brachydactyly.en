'''Brachydactyly''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] βραχύς = "short" plus δάκτυλος = "finger"), is a medical term which literally means "shortness of the fingers and toes" (digits). The shortness is relative to the length of other long [[bone]]s and other parts of the body. Brachydactyly is an inherited, usually [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] trait. It most often occurs as an isolated [[dysmelia]], but can also occur with other anomalies as part of many [[congenital]] [[syndrome]]s.

[[Nomogram]]s for normal values of finger length as a ratio to other body measurements have been published. In clinical [[genetics]] the most commonly used index of digit length is the [[dimensionless]] ratio of the length of the 3rd (middle) finger to the hand length. Both are expressed in the same units (centimeters, for example) and are measured in an open hand from the fingertip to the principal creases where the finger joins the palm and where the palm joins the wrist. A nomogram can be found in the Appendix of Jones, ed. '''Smith's Recognizable Patterns of Human Malformation''', 5th edition, Philadelphia: Saunders (1997).

==Types==
There are several types of Brachydactyly:
{| class="wikitable"
| '''Type''' || '''[[OMIM]]'''  ||   '''Gene '''   || '''[[Locus (genetics)|Locus]]'''  || '''Also known as/Description'''
 |- 
 |Type A1, BDA1|| {{OMIM2|112500}} || [[IHH (protein)|IHH]] [[BDA1B]] || 5p13.3-p13.2, 2q33-q35  ||  Brachydactyly type A1 or Farabee-type brachydactyly. BDA1 is an [[autosomal dominant]] inherited disease. Features include: Brachydactyly, Short or absent [[phalanx bones|phalanges]], Extra [[carpal bone]]s, [[Hypoplasia|Hypoplastic]] or absent [[ulna]] and Short [[metacarpal]] bones.

== Other syndromes  ==
In the above brachydactyly syndromes, short digits are the most prominent of the anomalies, but in many other syndromes ([[Down syndrome]], [[Cushing syndrome]], [[Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome]], etc.), brachydactyly is a minor feature compared to the other anomalies or problems comprising the syndrome.
