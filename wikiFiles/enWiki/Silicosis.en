It is a type of [[pneumoconiosis]].<ref>Derived from [[Ancient Greek|Gr.]] πνεῦμα ''pneúm''|a (lung) + buffer vowel ''-o-'' + κόνις ''kóni''|s (dust) + Eng. scient. suff. -''osis'' (like in asbest'''''osis''''' and silic'''''osis''''', see ref. 10).</ref>

Silicosis (particularly the acute form) is characterized by [[shortness of breath]], cough, fever, and [[cyanosis]] (bluish skin). It may often be misdiagnosed as [[pulmonary edema]] (fluid in the lungs), [[pneumonia]], or [[tuberculosis]].
  
The name ''silicosis'' (from the Latin ''silex'', or flint) was originally used in 1870 by Achille Visconti (1836-1911), [[prosector]] in the [[Ospedale Maggiore]] of Milan.<ref>''United States Bureau of Mines,'' "Bulletin: Volumes 476-478", ''U.S. G.P.O., (1995),'' p 63.</ref> The recognition of respiratory problems from breathing in dust dates to ancient Greeks and Romans.<ref>Rosen G: The History of Miners' Diseases: A Medical and Social Interpretation. New York, Schuman, 1943, pp.459-476.</ref> Agricola, in the mid-16th century, wrote about lung problems from dust inhalation in miners. In 1713, [[Bernardino Ramazzini]] noted [[asthmatic]] symptoms and sand-like substances in the lungs of stone cutters. With industrialization, as opposed to hand tools, came increased production of dust. The [[jackhammer|pneumatic hammer drill]] was introduced in 1897 and [[abrasive blasting|sandblasting]] was introduced in about 1904,<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |author= |title=Diseases associated with exposure to silica and nonfibrous silicate minerals.

==Classification==
Classification of silicosis is made according to the disease's severity (including radiographic pattern), onset, and rapidity of progression.<ref>NIOSH Hazard Review. Health Effects of Occupational Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica. DHHS 2002-129. pp. 23.</ref>  These include:

* ''Chronic simple silicosis''
Usually resulting from long-term exposure (10 years or more) to relatively low concentrations of silica dust and usually appearing 10–30 years after first exposure.<ref>Weisman DN and Banks DE. Silicosis. In: Interstitial Lung Disease. 4th ed. London: BC Decker Inc. 2003, pp391.</ref> This is the most common type of silicosis.  Patients with this type of silicosis, especially early on, may not have obvious signs or symptoms of disease, but abnormalities may be detected by x-ray. Chronic cough and [[exertion]]al [[dyspnea]] are common findings. Radiographically, chronic simple silicosis reveals a profusion of small (<10&nbsp;mm in diameter) opacities, typically rounded, and predominating in the upper lung zones. 

* ''Accelerated silicosis''
Silicosis that develops 5–10 years after first exposure to higher concentrations of silica dust.  Symptoms and x-ray findings are similar to chronic simple silicosis, but occur earlier and tend to progress more rapidly. Patients with accelerated silicosis are at greater risk for complicated disease, including progressive massive fibrosis (PMF).

* ''Complicated silicosis''
Silicosis can become "complicated" by the development of severe scarring ([[progressive massive fibrosis]], or also known as conglomerate silicosis), where the small nodules gradually become confluent, reaching a size of 1&nbsp;cm or greater.  PMF is associated with more severe symptoms and respiratory impairment than simple disease. Silicosis can also be complicated by other lung disease, such as tuberculosis, non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection, and fungal infection, certain autoimmune diseases, and [[lung cancer]]. Complicated silicosis is more common with accelerated silicosis than with the chronic variety. 

* ''Acute silicosis''
Silicosis that develops a few weeks to 5 years after exposure to high concentrations of respirable silica dust.  This is also known as silicoproteinosis. Symptoms of acute silicosis include more rapid onset of severe disabling shortness of breath, cough, weakness, and weight loss, often leading to death. The x-ray usually reveals a diffuse alveolar filling with air bronchograms, described as a [[ground-glass]] appearance, and similar to [[pneumonia]], [[pulmonary edema]], alveolar [[hemorrhage]], and alveolar cell [[lung cancer]].

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:8.- Miner's lung with silicosis and tuberculosis.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Miner's lung with silicosis and [[tuberculosis]].]]

Because chronic silicosis is slow to develop, signs and symptoms may not appear until years after exposure.<ref name="WHO"/> Signs and symptoms include:

* [[Dyspnea]] (shortness of breath) exacerbated by exertion
* Cough, often persistent and sometimes severe
* [[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]]
* [[Tachypnea]] (rapid breathing) which is often labored
* Loss of appetite and weight loss
* Chest pain
* Fever
* Gradual dark shallow rifts in nails eventually leading to cracks as protein fibers within nail beds are destroyed.

In advanced cases, the following may also occur:

* [[Cyanosis]] (blue skin)
* [[Cor pulmonale]] (right [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] heart disease)
* Respiratory insufficiency
Patients with silicosis are particularly susceptible to [[tuberculosis]] (TB) infection—known as [[silicotuberculosis]].  The reason for the increased risk—3 fold increased incidence—is not well understood.  It is thought that silica damages pulmonary [[macrophages]], inhibiting their ability to kill [[mycobacteria]]. Even workers with prolonged silica exposure, but without silicosis, are at a similarly increased risk for TB.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cowie RL |title=The epidemiology of tuberculosis in gold miners with silicosis |journal=Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. |volume=150 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=1460–2 |year=1994 |month=November |pmid=7952577 |url=http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7952577}}</ref>

Pulmonary complications of silicosis also include Chronic Bronchitis and airflow limitation (indistinguishable from that caused by smoking), non-tuberculous Mycobacterium infection, fungal lung infection, compensatory emphysema, and [[pneumothorax]]. There are some data revealing an association between silicosis and certain [[autoimmune diseases]], including [[nephritis]], [[Scleroderma]], and [[Systemic Lupus Erythematosus]], especially in acute or accelerated silicosis.  

In 1996, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) reviewed the medical data and classified crystalline silica as "[[carcinogenic]] to humans." The risk was best seen in cases with underlying silicosis, with relative risks for lung cancer of 2-4. Numerous subsequent studies have been published confirming this risk. In 2006, Pelucchi et al. concluded, "The silicosis-cancer association is now established, in agreement with other studies and meta-analysis."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pelucchi C, Pira E, Piolatto G, Coggiola M, Carta P, La Vecchia C |title=Occupational silica exposure and lung cancer risk: a review of epidemiological studies 1996–2005 |journal=Ann.

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Coupe de poumon atteint de silicose.jpg|thumb|Slice of a lung affected by silicosis]]
When small silica dust particles are inhaled, they can embed themselves deeply into the tiny [[alveoli|alveolar sacs]] and ducts in the lungs, where oxygen and carbon dioxide gases are exchanged. There, the lungs cannot clear out the dust by mucous or coughing. 

When fine particles of silica dust  are deposited in the lungs, [[macrophage]]s that ingest the dust particles will set off an [[inflammation]] response by releasing [[tumor necrosis factors]], [[interleukin-1]], [[leukotriene B4]] and other [[cytokine]]s.  In turn, these stimulate [[fibroblast]]s to proliferate and produce collagen around the silica particle, thus resulting in [[fibrosis]] and the formation of the nodular lesions.  The inflammatory effects of crystalline silica are apparently mediated by the [[Nalp3]] [[inflammasome]].<ref name="pmid18577586">{{cite journal |author=Cassel SL, Eisenbarth SC, Iyer SS, ''et al.'' |title=The Nalp3 inflammasome is essential for the development of silicosis |journal=Proc.

Characteristic lung tissue pathology in nodular silicosis consists of fibrotic [[Nodule (medicine)|nodule]]s with concentric "onion-skinned" arrangement of [[collagen]] fibers, central [[hyalinization]], and a cellular peripheral zone, with lightly [[birefringent]] particles seen under [[polarized light]]. The silicotic nodule represents a specific tissue response to crystalline silica.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In acute silicosis, microscopic pathology shows a [[Periodic acid-Schiff stain|periodic acid-Schiff]] positive alveolar [[exudate]] ([[alveolar lipoproteinosis]]) and a cellular infiltrate of the alveolar walls.<ref name="Wagner">{{cite journal | last=Wagner | first=GR | title=Asbestosis and silicosis | journal=Lancet | volume=349 | issue=9061 | pages=1311–1315 | month=May | year=1997 | pmid=9142077 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(96)07336-9 }}</ref>

===Silica===
{{main|Silicon dioxide}}
[[Silicon]] (Si) is the second most common element in the [[Earth's crust]] ([[oxygen]] is the most common). The compound [[silica]], also known as silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), is formed from silicon and [[oxygen]] atoms. Since oxygen and silicon make up about 75% of the Earth, the compound silica is quite common. It is found in many rocks, such as marble, sandstone, flint and slate, and in some metallic ores. Silica can be a main component of sand. It can also be in soil, mortar, plaster, and shingles. The cutting, breaking, crushing, drilling, grinding, or abrasive blasting of these materials may produce fine silica dust.

Silica occurs in 3 forms: [[crystalline]], [[microcrystalline]] (or [[cryptocrystalline]]) and [[amorphous]] (non-crystalline). "Free" silica is composed of pure silicon dioxide, not combined with other elements, whereas [[silicates]] (e.g. [[talc]], [[asbestos]], and [[mica]]) are SiO<sub>2</sub> combined with an appreciable portion of [[cation]]s.

* '''Crystalline silica''' exists in 7 different forms ([[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]]), depending upon the temperature of formation. The main 3 polymorphs are [[quartz]], [[cristobalite]], and [[tridymite]]. Quartz is the second most common mineral in the world (next to [[feldspar]]).<ref>Crystalline Silica Primer, US Dept of the Interior and US Bureau of Mines, 1992.</ref>

* '''Microcrystalline silica''' consists of minute quartz crystals bonded together with amorphous silica. Examples include [[flint]] and [[chert]].

* '''Amorphous silica''' consists of [[kieselgur]] ([[diatomite]]), from the skeletons of [[diatoms]], and vitreous silica, produced by heating and then rapid cooling of crystalline silica. Amorphous silica is less toxic than crystalline, but not biologically inert, and diatomite, when heated, can convert to tridymite or cristobalite.

Silica flour is nearly pure SiO<sub>2</sub> finely ground. Silica flour has been used as a polisher or buffer, as well as paint extender, abrasive, and filler for cosmetics. Silica flour has been associated with all types of silicosis, including acute silicosis. 

Silicosis is due to deposition of fine respirable dust (less than 10 [[micrometers]] in [[diameter]]) containing crystalline silicon dioxide in the form of alpha-quartz, cristobalite, or tridymite.

==Diagnosis==
There are three key elements to the diagnosis of silicosis. First, the patient history should reveal exposure to sufficient silica dust to cause this illness.  Second, chest imaging (usually chest x-ray) that reveals findings consistent with silicosis. Third, there are no underlying illnesses that are more likely to be causing the abnormalities. Physical examination is usually unremarkable unless there is complicated disease. Also, the examination findings are not specific for silicosis. [[Pulmonary function testing]] may reveal airflow limitation, restrictive defects, reduced diffusion capacity, mixed defects, or may be normal (especially without complicated disease). Most cases of silicosis do not require tissue biopsy for diagnosis, but this may be necessary in some cases, primarily to exclude other conditions.

For uncomplicated silicosis, chest x-ray will confirm the presence of small (< 10&nbsp;mm) nodules in the lungs, especially in the upper lung zones.  Using the [[ILO]] classification system, these are of profusion 1/0 or greater and shape/size "p", "q", or "r". Lung zone involvement and profusion increases with disease progression. In advanced cases of silicosis, large opacity (> 1&nbsp;cm) occurs from coalescence of small opacities, particularly in the upper lung zones. With retraction of the lung tissue, there is compensatory [[emphysema]]. Enlargement of the hilum is common with chronic and accelerated silicosis. In about 5-10% of cases, the nodes will calcify circumferentially, producing so-called "eggshell" [[calcification]].  This finding is not pathognomonic (diagnostic) of silicosis. In some cases, the pulmonary nodules may also become calcified.  

A computed tomography or [[CT scan]] can also provide a mode detailed analysis of the lungs, and can reveal cavitation due to concomitant mycobacterial infection.

==Prevention==
The best way to prevent silicosis is to identify work-place activities that produce respirable crystalline silica dust and then to eliminate or control the dust ("primary prevention"). Water spray is often used where dust emanates.  Dust can also be controlled through dry air filtering.<ref>{{cite web|last=CPWR-The Center for Construction Research and Training|title=Work Safely with Silica: methods to control silica exposure|url=http://plan.silica-safe.org}}</ref> 

Following observations on industry workers in [[Lucknow]] (India), experiments on rats found that [[jaggery]] (a traditional sugar) had a preventive action against silicosis.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sahu |first=Anand P. |coauthors=Saxena, Ashok K. |year=1994 |month=October |title=Enhanced Translocation of Particles from Lungs by Jaggery |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=102 |issue=S5 |pages=211–214 |pmid=7882934 |url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/1994/Suppl-5/sahu-full.html |accessdate=2007-05-20 |doi=10.2307/3432088 |pmc=1567304 |jstor=3432088 |publisher=Environmental Health Perspectives, Vol. 102}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Silicosis is an irreversible condition with no cure.<ref name="Wagner"/> Treatment options currently focus on alleviating the symptoms and preventing complications.  These include:

* Stopping further exposure to silica and other lung irritants, including [[tobacco smoking]].
* [[cough medicine|Cough suppressants]].
* [[Antibiotic]]s for bacterial lung infection.
* TB prophylaxis for those with positive [[tuberculin skin test]] or [[Tuberculosis diagnosis#Interferon-γ release assays|IGRA]] blood test.
* Prolonged anti-tuberculosis (multi-drug regimen) for those with active TB.
* Chest [[physiotherapy]] to help the bronchial drainage of [[mucus]].
* [[Oxygen]] administration to treat [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxemia]], if present.
* [[Bronchodilator]]s to facilitate breathing.
* [[Lung transplantation]] to replace the damaged lung tissue is the most effective treatment, but is associated with severe risks of its own.
* For acute silicosis, [[bronchoalveolar lavage]] may alleviate symptoms, but does not decrease overall mortality.

Experimental treatments include:
* Inhalation of powdered [[aluminium]], [[d-penicillamine]] and [[polyvinyl pyridine-N-oxide]].
* [[Corticosteroid]] therapy.
* The herbal extract [[tetrandine]] may slow progression of silicosis.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Chao, D.H. ; Ma, J.Y.C. ; Malanga, C.J. ; Banks, D.E. ; Hubbs, A.F. ; Rojanasakul, Y. ; Castranova, V. ; Ma, J.K.H | title=Multiple emulsion-mediated enhancement of the therapeutic effect of tetrandine against silicosis | publisher=West Virginia University School of Pharmacy | date=July 1996 | url=http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=463739 | quote=Previously it was shown that the action of tetrandrine is attributed to its ability to inhibit the release of reactive oxygen metabolites and inflammatory cytokines by alveolar macrophages, and that targeted delivery of tetrandrine to alveolar macrophages using a multiple emulsion system minimizes drug toxicity, maintains the drug's pharmacological activity, and enhances tetrandrine distribution in the lungs while reducing systemic drug distribution. This study provides  evidence of emulsion-mediated enhancement of drug action in the lungs against silica-induced lung injury using a rat model. }}</ref>

According to CDC data,<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Ch. 2: Fatal and Nonfatal Injuries, and Selected Illnesses: Respiratory Diseases: Pneumoconioses: Silicosis |chapterurl=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2004-146/ch2/ch2-10-3-5.asp.htm |title=Worker Health Chartbook 2004 |publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) |year=2004 |id=2004-146 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2004-146/ |ref={{harvid|NIOSH|2004-146}}}}</ref> silicosis in the United States is relatively rare. The incidence of deaths due to silicosis declined by 84% between 1968 and 1999, and only 187 deaths in 1999 had silicosis as the underlying or contributing cause.<ref>{{harvnb|NIOSH|2004-146|loc=[http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2004-146/detail/imagedetail.asp@imgid234.htm Fig2-192]}}</ref> Additionally, cases of silicosis in Michigan, New Jersey, and Ohio are highly correlated to industry and occupation.<ref name=Fig2_190>{{harvnb|NIOSH|2004-146|loc=[http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2004-146/detail/imagedetail.asp@imgid232.htm Fig2-190]}}</ref>

Although silicosis has been known for centuries, the [[industrialization]] of [[mining]] has led to an increase in silicosis cases. [[Jackhammer|Pneumatic drilling]] in mines and less commonly, mining using [[explosives]], would raise rock dust. In the United States, a 1930 [[Hawk's Nest incident|epidemic of silicosis]] due to the construction of the Hawk's Nest Tunnel near [[Gauley Bridge, West Virginia]] caused the death of at least 400 workers.  Other accounts place the mortality figure at well over 1000 workers, primarily African American transient workers from the southern United States.<ref>"The Hawks Nest Tunnel," Patricia Spangler, 2008</ref>  Workers who became ill were fired and left the region, making an exact mortality account difficult.<ref>{{cite web|last=Keenan |first=Steve |url=http://www.fayettetribune.com/local/local_story_093161850.html |title=Book explores Hawks Nest tunnel history » Local News » The Fayette Tribune, Oak Hill, W.Va |publisher=Fayettetribune.com |date=2008-04-02 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref>  The [[Hawks Nest Tunnel Disaster]] is known as "America's worst industrial disaster.<ref>“The Hawk’s Nest Incident: America’s Worst Industrial Disaster," Dr. Martin Cherniack 1986</ref> The prevalence of silicosis led some men to grow what is called a miner's mustache, in an attempt to intercept as much dust as possible.

Some have opined that [[cannabis]] contaminated with silica may cause silicosis in users,<ref>[http://cannabisculture.com/articles/4907.html Europe Flooded with Contaminated Cannabis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.ukcia.org/library/contam/index.php Cannabis contamination in the UK]</ref> but there are no scientific data to support this.

Chronic simple silicosis has been reported to occur from environmental exposures to silica in regions with high silica soil content and frequent dust storms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Norboo T, Angchuk PT, Yahya M, ''et al.'' |title=Silicosis in a Himalayan village population: role of environmental dust |journal=Thorax |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=341–3 |year=1991 |month=May |pmid=2068689 |pmc=463131 |url=http://thorax.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=2068689}}</ref>

Also, the mining establishment of [[Delamar Ghost Town]], Nevada was ruined by a dry-mining process that produced a silicosis-causing dust. After hundreds of deaths from silicosis, the town was nicknamed ''The Widowmaker''. The problem in those days was somewhat resolved with an addition of a nozzle to the drill which sprayed a mist of water, turning dust raised by drilling into mud, but this inhibited mining work. 

Because of work-exposure to silica dust, silicosis is an occupational hazard to [[mining]], [[sandblast]]ing, quarry, [[ceramic]]s and [[foundry]] workers, as well as grinders, stone cutters, refractory brick workers, tombstone workers, pottery workers, flint knappers and others. Brief or casual exposure to low levels of crystalline silica dust are said to not produce clinically significant lung disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Adverse effects of crystalline silica exposure. American Thoracic Society Committee of the Scientific Assembly on Environmental and Occupational Health |journal=Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. |volume=155 |issue=2 |pages=761–8 |year=1997 |month=February |pmid=9032226 |url=http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9032226}}</ref>

Protective measures such as [[respirators]] have brought a steady decline in death rates due to silicosis in Western countries. Unfortunately, this is not true of less developed countries where work conditions are poor and respiratory equipment is seldom used. For instance, life expectancy for silver miners in [[Potosí]], Bolivia is around 40 years due to silicosis.

Recently, silicosis in Turkish denim sandblasters was detected as a new cause of silicosis due to recurring, poor working conditions.<ref>[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=156301 Denim sandblasters contract fatal silicosis in illegal workshops]</ref>

Silicosis is seen in horses associated with inhalation of dust from certain [[cristobalite]]-containing soils in California.

Social Realist artist [[Noel Counihan]] depicted men who worked in industrial mines in Australia in the '40s dying of Silicosis in his series 'the miners' (1947 linocuts).
