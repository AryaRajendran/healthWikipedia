{{Bile ducts and pancreas}}
A '''bile duct''' is any of a number of long tube-like structures that carry [[bile]].

Bile, required for the [[digestion]] of food, is secreted by the [[liver]] into passages that carry bile toward the [[hepatic duct]], which joins with the [[cystic duct]] (carrying bile to and from the [[gallbladder]]) to form the [[common bile duct]], which opens into the [[intestine]].  

The '''biliary tree''' (see below) is the whole network of various sized ducts branching through the liver.

The path is as follows: [[Bile canaliculi]] '''→''' [[Canals of Hering]] '''→'''  [[interlobular bile ducts]] '''→''' [[intrahepatic bile ducts]] '''→''' left and right [[hepatic ducts]] ''merge to form'' '''→'''  [[common hepatic duct]] ''exits liver and joins'' '''→'''  [[cystic duct]] (from [[gall bladder]]) ''forming'' '''→'''  [[common bile duct]] '''→'''  ''joins with'' [[pancreatic duct]] '''→'''  ''forming'' [[ampulla of Vater]] '''→'''  ''enters'' [[duodenum]]

==Common bile duct==
Bile duct is green like the gallbladder, because of bile stains.

==Pathology==
Blockage of the bile duct by a [[cancer]], gallstones, or scarring from injury prevents the bile from being transported to the intestine and the active ingredient in the bile ([[bilirubin]]) instead accumulates in the [[blood]]. This condition results in [[jaundice]], where the [[Human skin|skin]] and [[Human eyes|eyes]] become yellow from the bilirubin in the blood. This condition also causes severe itchiness from the bilirubin deposited in the tissues. In certain types of jaundice, the urine will be noticeably darker, and the stools will be much paler than usual. This is caused by the bilirubin all going to the bloodstream and being filtered into the urine by the kidneys, instead of some being lost in the stools through the ampulla of Vater.

[[Jaundice]] is commonly caused by conditions such as [[pancreatic cancer]], which causes blockage of the bile duct passing through the cancerous portion of the pancreas; [[cholangiocarcinoma]], cancer of the bile ducts; blockage by a stone in patients with [[gallstone]]s; and from scarring after injury to the bile duct during gallbladder removal.

==Sensation==

Inflation of a balloon in the bile duct causes, through the [[vagus nerve]], activation of the [[brain stem]] and the [[insular cortex]], [[prefrontal cortex]], and [[somatosensory cortex]].<ref>

==Drainage==<!--Biliary drainage redirects here-->
Biliary drainage is performed with a tube or catheter (called a ''biliary drain'', ''biliary [[stent]]'' or ''biliary catheter'') by a [[surgeon]] or, commonly, an [[interventional radiologist]].<ref>
[http://medicalcenter.osu.edu/PatientEd/Materials/PDFDocs/procedure/tube-care/urology/biliary.pdf Biliary Drain] Patient information from The Ohio State University Medical Center. Retrieved May 2011</ref> It can be used to relieve a blockage in the bile duct, either permanently or as a temporary solution before definite treatment such as surgery. The drain can be placed [[percutaneous]]ly through the liver, with the procedure then being called ''percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage'' (PTBD).<ref>{{cite doi|10.2214/AJR.09.3461}}</ref> This can additionally be performed as part of a [[percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography]], then a form of [[interventional radiology]]. A biliary drain can also be used to take bile samples for diagnostic workup or disease monitoring, as well as providing a [[route of administration]] for medical substances.

In infants with [[biliary atresia]], [[hepatoportoenterostomy]] is an alternative method of providing bile drainage.
