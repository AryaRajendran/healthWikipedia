''BRAF'' is a human [[gene]] that makes a [[protein]] called B-Raf. The gene is also referred to as '''proto-oncogene B-Raf''' and '''v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1''', while the protein is more formally known as '''serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf'''.<ref name="pmid2284096">{{cite journal | author = Sithanandam G, Kolch W, Duh FM, Rapp UR | title = Complete coding sequence of a human B-raf cDNA and detection of B-raf protein kinase with isozyme specific antibodies | journal = Oncogene | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = 1775–80 | year = 1990 | month = December | pmid = 2284096 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid1565476">{{cite journal | author = Sithanandam G, Druck T, Cannizzaro LA, Leuzzi G, Huebner K, Rapp UR | title = B-raf and a B-raf pseudogene are located on 7q in man | journal = Oncogene | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 795–9 | year = 1992 | month = April | pmid = 1565476 | doi = | url = }}</ref>

==Biological Function==

B-Raf is a member of the [[Raf kinase]] family of growth [[signal transduction]] [[protein kinase]]s.

==== Important Subregions ====

'''P-Loop'''

The [[Walker motifs|P-loop]] of B-Raf (residues 464-471) stabilizes the non-transferable [[phosphate]] groups of ATP during enzyme ATP-binding.  Specifically, [[serine|S]]467, [[phenylalanine|F]]468, and [[glycine|G]]469 backbone [[amide]]s hydrogen-bond to the β-phosphate  of ATP to anchor the molecule.  B-Raf functional motifs have been determined by analyzing the homology of [[Protein kinase A|PKA]]  analyzed by Hanks and Hunter to the B-Raf kinase domain.<ref name="pmid7768349">{{cite journal | author = Hanks SK, Hunter T | title = Protein kinases 6.

[[valine|V]]471, [[cysteine|C]]532, [[tryptophan|W]]531, [[threonine|T]]529, [[leucine|L]]514, and [[alanine|A]]481 form a hydrophobic pocket within which the adenine of ATP is anchored through Van der Waals attractions upon ATP binding.<ref name="pmid7768349">{{cite journal | author = Hanks SK, Hunter T | title = Protein kinases 6.

Residues 574-581 compose a section of the kinase domain responsible for supporting the transfer of the γ-phosphate of ATP to B-Raf's protein substrate.  In particular, [[aspartic acid|D]]576 acts as a [[Base (chemistry)|proton acceptor]] to activate the [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] hydroxyl oxygen on substrate serine or threonine residues, allowing the phosphate transfer reaction to occur mediated by [[acid catalysis|base-catalysis]].<ref name="pmid7768349">{{cite journal | author = Hanks SK, Hunter T | title = Protein kinases 6.

'''DFG Motif'''

D594, F595, and G596 compose a motif central to B-Raf's function in both its inactive and active state.

'''Activation Loop'''

Residues 596-600 form strong hydrophobic interactions with the P-loop in the inactive conformation of the kinase, locking the kinase in its inactive state until the activation loop is phosphorylated, destabilizing these interactions with the presence of negative charge.  This triggers the shift to the active state of the kinase.  Specifically, L597 and V600 of the activation loop interact with G466, F468, and V471 of the P-loop to keep the kinase domain inactive until it is phosphorylated.<ref name="pmid15035987">{{cite journal | author = Wan, PT et al. | title = Mechanism of activation of the RAF-ERK signaling pathway by oncogenic mutations of B-RAF | journal = Cell | volume = 116 | issue = 6 | pages = 855–67 | year = 2004 | month = March | pmid = 15035987 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00215-6| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%28Wan%20PT[Author]%29%20AND%20Marais%20R[Author | issn = }}</ref>

=== Activating the Catalytic Domain ===

==== Releasing the Autoinhibitory CR1 Domain ====

The kinase (CR3) domain of human [[Raf kinase]]s is inhibited by two mechanisms: [[enzyme induction and inhibition|autoinhibition]] by its own [[Regulatory enzymes|regulatory]] [[Ras subfamily|Ras]]-[[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]]-binding CR1 domain and a lack of [[Posttranslational modification|post-translational]] phosphorylation of key serine and [[tyrosine]] residues (S338 and Y341 for c-Raf) in the CR2 hinge region.  During B-Raf activation, the protein's [[enzyme induction and inhibition|autoinhibitory]] CR1 domain first binds Ras-GTP's [[Effector (biology)|effector]] domain to the CR1 Ras-binding domain (RBD) to release the kinase CR3 domain like other members of the human [[Raf kinase| Raf kinase family]].  The CR1-Ras interaction is later strengthened through the binding of the [[cysteine]]-rich subdomain (CRD) of CR1 to Ras and [[Cell membrane|membrane]] [[phospholipid]]s.<ref name="Cutler Autoinhibition">{{cite journal | author = Cutler, RE et al. | title = Autoregulation of the Raf-1 serine/threonine kinase | journal = PNAS | volume = 95 | issue = 16 | pages = 9214–9219 | year = 1998 | month = August | pmid = 9689060 | doi = | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/95/16/9214 | issn = | pmc=21318}}</ref>  Unlike [[ARAF|A-Raf]] and [[C-Raf]], which must be phosphorylated on hydroxyl-containing CR2 residues before fully releasing CR1 to become active, B-Raf is constituitively phosphorylated on CR2 S445.<ref name="pmid10205168">{{cite journal | author = Mason, CS et al. | title = Serine and tyrosine phosphorylations cooperate in Raf-1, but not B-Raf activation | journal = EMBO J. | volume = 18 | issue = 8 | pages = 2137–2148 | year = 1999 | month = April | pmid = 10205168 | doi = 10.1093/emboj/18.8.2137 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1171298/ | issn = | pmc=1171298}}</ref>  This allows the negatively charged phosphoserine to immediately repel CR1 through steric and electrostatic interactions once the regulatory domain is unbound, freeing the CR3 kinase domain to interact with substrate proteins.

==== Transforming the Protein Kinase CR3 Domain into Active Conformation ====

After the autoinhibitory CR1 regulatory domain is released, B-Raf's CR3 [[Protein kinase|kinase]] domain must change to its [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-binding active [[Conformational isomerism|conformer]] before it can catalyze protein phosphorylation.  In the inactive conformation, F595 of the DFG motif blocks the [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] [[adenine]] binding pocket while activation loop residues form hydrophobic interactions with the P-loop, stopping ATP from accessing its binding site.  When the activation loop is phosphorylated, the negative charge of the phosphate is unstable in the hydrophobic environment of the P-loop.  As a result, the activation loop changes conformation, stretching out across the C-lobe of the kinase domain.  In this process, it forms stabilizing [[Beta sheet|β-sheet]] interactions with the β6 strand.  Meanwhile, the phosphorylated residue approaches K507, forming a stabilizing salt bridge to lock the activation loop into place.  The DFG motif changes conformation with the activation loop, causing F595 to move out of the adenine nucleotide binding site and into a hydrophobic pocket bordered by the [[alpha helix|αC and αE helices]].  Together, DFG and activation loop movement upon phosphorylation open the ATP binding site.  Since all other substrate-binding and catalytic domains are already in place, phosphorylation of the activation loop alone activates B-Raf's kinase domain through a chain reaction that essentially removes a lid from an otherwise-prepared active site.<ref name="pmid15035987">{{cite journal | author = Wan, PT et al. | title = Mechanism of activation of the RAF-ERK signaling pathway by oncogenic mutations of B-RAF | journal = Cell | volume = 116 | issue = 6 | pages = 855–67 | year = 2004 | month = March | pmid = 15035987 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00215-6| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%28Wan%20PT[Author]%29%20AND%20Marais%20R[Author | issn = }}</ref>

To effectively catalyze protein phosphorylation via the bimolecular substitution of serine and threonine residues with [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] as a [[leaving group]], B-Raf must first bind ATP and then stabilize the [[transition state]] as the γ-phosphate of ATP is transferred.<ref name="pmid7768349">{{cite journal | author = Hanks SK, Hunter T | title = Protein kinases 6.

==== ATP Binding ====

B-Raf binds ATP by anchoring the adenine nucleotide in a [[nonpolar]] pocket (yellow, Figure 1) and orienting the molecule through hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic interactions with phosphate groups.  In addition to the P-loop and DFG motif phosphate binding described above, K483 and E500 play key roles in stabilizing non-transferable phosphate groups.

==== Protein Phosphorylation ====

Once ATP is bound to the B-Raf kinase domain, D576 of the catalytic loop activates a substrate hydroxyl group, increasing its nucleophilicity to kinetically drive the phosphorylation reaction while other catalytic loop residues stabilize the transition state.(Figure 2).  N581 chelates the divalent magnesium cation associated with ATP to help orient the molecule for optimal substitution.  K578 neutralizes the negative charge on the γ-phosphate group of ATP so that the activated ser/thr substrate residue won't experience as much electron-electron repulsion when attacking the phosphate.  After the phosphate group is transferred, ADP and the new phosphoprotein are released.<ref name="pmid7768349">{{cite journal | author = Hanks SK, Hunter T | title = Protein kinases 6.

=== Inhibitors ===

Since constituitively active B-Raf mutants commonly cause cancer (see Clinical Significance) by excessively signaling cells to grow, inhibitors of B-Raf have been developed for both the inactive and active conformations of the kinase domain as cancer therapeutic candidates.<ref name="pmid15035987">{{cite journal | author = Wan, PT et al. | title = Mechanism of activation of the RAF-ERK signaling pathway by oncogenic mutations of B-RAF | journal = Cell | volume = 116 | issue = 6 | pages = 855–67 | year = 2004 | month = March | pmid = 15035987 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00215-6| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%28Wan%20PT[Author]%29%20AND%20Marais%20R[Author | issn = }}</ref><ref name="pmid18287029">{{cite journal | author = Tsai J et al. | title = Discovery of a selective inhibitor of oncogenic B-Raf kinase with potent antimelanoma activity | journal = Proc.

==== BAY43-9006 (Sorafenib) ====

[[File:Sorafenib BRAF Labeled.png| thumb | left | upright=1.5 | Figure 3: B-Raf kinase domain locked in the inactive conformation by bound BAY43-9006. Hydrophobic interactions anchor BAY43-9006 in the ATP binding site while urea group hydrogen-bonding traps D594 of the DFG motif.

BAY43-9006 ([[Sorafenib]], Nexavar)is a V600E [[mutant]] B-Raf and [[C-Raf]] inhibitor approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for the treatment of primary [[hepatocellular carcinoma|liver]] and [[renal cell carcinoma|kidney]] cancer.  Bay43-9006 disables the B-Raf [[protein kinase|kinase]] domain by locking the enzyme in its inactive form.  The inhibitor accomplishes this by blocking the ATP binding pocket through high-[[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the kinase domain.  It then binds key activation loop and DFG motif residues to stop the movement of the activation loop and DFG motif to the active conformation.  Finally, a trifluoromethyl phenyl moiety sterically blocks the DFG motif and activation loop active conformation site, making it impossible for the kinase domain to shift conformation to become active.<ref name="pmid15035987">{{cite journal | author = Wan, PT et al. | title = Mechanism of activation of the RAF-ERK signaling pathway by oncogenic mutations of B-RAF | journal = Cell | volume = 116 | issue = 6 | pages = 855–67 | year = 2004 | month = March | pmid = 15035987 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00215-6| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%28Wan%20PT[Author]%29%20AND%20Marais%20R[Author | issn = }}</ref>

The distal [[pyridine|pyridyl]] ring of BAY43-9006 anchors in the hydrophobic nucleotide-binding pocket of the kinase N-lobe, interacting with W531, F583, and F595.  The hydrophobic interactions with catalytic loop F583 and DFG motif F595 stabilize the inactive conformation of these structures, decreasing the likelihood of enzyme activation.  Further hydrophobic interaction of K483, L514, and T529 with the center phenyl ring increase the [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] of the kinase domain for the inhibitor.  Hydrophobic interaction of F595 with the center ring as well decreases the energetic favorability of a DFG conformation switch further.  Finally, polar interactions of BAY43-9006 with the kinase domain continue this trend of increasing enzyme affinity for the inhibitor and stabilizing DFG residues in the inactive conformation.  E501 and C532 hydrogen bond the [[urea]] and pyridyl groups of the inhibitor respectively while the [[urea]] [[carbonyl]] accepts a hydrogen bond from D594's backbone [[amide]] nitrogen to lock the DFG motif in place.<ref name="pmid15035987">{{cite journal | author = Wan, PT et al. | title = Mechanism of activation of the RAF-ERK signaling pathway by oncogenic mutations of B-RAF | journal = Cell | volume = 116 | issue = 6 | pages = 855–67 | year = 2004 | month = March | pmid = 15035987 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00215-6| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%28Wan%20PT[Author]%29%20AND%20Marais%20R[Author | issn = }}</ref>

The trifluoromethyl phenyl moiety cements the thermodynamic favorability of the inactive conformation when the kinase domain is bound to BAY43-9006 by sterically blocking the hydrophobic pocket between the αC and αE helices that the DFG motif and activation loop would inhabit upon shifting to their locations in the active conformation of the protein.<ref name="pmid15035987">{{cite journal | author = Wan, PT et al. | title = Mechanism of activation of the RAF-ERK signaling pathway by oncogenic mutations of B-RAF | journal = Cell | volume = 116 | issue = 6 | pages = 855–67 | year = 2004 | month = March | pmid = 15035987 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00215-6| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%28Wan%20PT[Author]%29%20AND%20Marais%20R[Author | issn = }}</ref>

By inhibiting only the active form of the kinase, Vemurafenib selectively inhibits the proliferation of cells with unregulated B-Raf, normally those that cause [[cancer]].

PLX4720 has good affinity for the ATP binding site partially because its anchor region, a 7-aza[[indole]] [[Bicyclic molecule|bicyclic]], only differs from the natural adenine that occupies the site in two places where nitrogen atoms have been replaced by carbon.  This enables strong intermolecular interactions like N7 hydrogen bonding to C532 and N1 hydrogen bonding to Q530 to be preserved.  Excellent fit within the ATP-binding hydrophobic pocket (C532, W531, T529, L514, A481) increases binding affinity as well.  [[Ketone]] linker hydrogen bonding to water and difluoro-phenyl fit in a second hydrophobic pocket (A481, V482, K483, V471, I527, T529, L514, and F583) contribute to the exceptionally high binding affinity overall.  Selective binding to active Raf is accomplished by the terminal propyl group that binds to a Raf-selective pocket created by a shift of the αC helix.  Selectivity for the active conformation of the kinase is further increased by a pH-sensitive deprotonated [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] group that is stabilized by hydrogen bonding with the backbone peptide NH of D594 in the active state.  In the inactive state, the inhibitor's sulfonamide group interacts with the backbone [[carbonyl]] of that residue instead, creating repulsion.  Thus, Vemurafenib binds preferentially to the active state of B-Raf's kinase domain.<ref name="pmid18287029">{{cite journal | author = Tsai J et al. | title = Discovery of a selective inhibitor of oncogenic B-Raf kinase with potent antimelanoma activity | journal = Proc.

==Clinical significance==
Mutations in the ''BRAF'' gene can cause disease in two ways. First, mutations can be inherited and cause birth defects. Second, mutations can appear later in life and cause cancer, as an [[oncogene]].

Inherited mutations in this gene cause [[cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome]], a disease characterized by heart defects, mental retardation and a distinctive facial appearance.<ref name="pmid16825433">{{cite journal | author = Roberts A, Allanson J, Jadico SK, Kavamura MI, Noonan J, Opitz JM, Young T, Neri G | title = The cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome | journal = J.

The V600E mutation of the BRAF gene has been associated with [[hairy cell leukemia]] in numerous [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22246856 studies] and has been suggested for use in screening for [[Lynch syndrome]] to reduce the number of patients undergoing unnecessary [[MLH1]] sequencing.<ref name="pmid19125127">{{cite journal | author = Palomaki GE, McClain MR, Melillo S, Hampel HL, Thibodeau SN | title = EGAPP supplementary evidence review: DNA testing strategies aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality from Lynch syndrome | journal = Genet.

===BRAF mutants===
More than 30 mutations of the ''BRAF'' gene associated with human cancers have been identified.

Depending on the type of mutation the kinase activity towards [[MEK]] may also vary. In the same paper it has been reported that most of the mutants stimulate enhanced B-Raf [[kinase]] activity toward MEK. However, a few mutants act through a different mechanism because although their activity toward MEK is reduced, they adopt a conformation that activates wild-type C-RAF, which then signals to [[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK]].
