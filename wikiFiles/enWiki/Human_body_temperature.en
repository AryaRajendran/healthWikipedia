'''Normal human body temperature''', also known as '''normothermia''' or '''euthermia''', depends upon the place in the [[human body|body]] at which the measurement is made, and the time of day and level of activity of the person.  [[Lies to children|Despite what many schoolchildren are taught]], there is no single number that represents a normal or healthy temperature for all people under all circumstances using any place of measurement.

Different parts of the body have different temperatures.  [[Rectal]] and [[vagina]]l measurements, or measurements taken directly inside the body cavity, are typically slightly higher than oral measurements, and oral measurements are somewhat higher than skin temperature.  The commonly accepted average core body temperature (taken internally) is {{val|37.0|u=°C}} ({{val|98.6|u=°F}}).  The typical oral (under the tongue) measurement is slightly cooler, at 36.8° ± 0.4°C (98.2° ± 0.7°F), and temperatures taken in other places (such as under the arm or in the ear) produce different typical numbers.<ref name="Longo"/>   Although some people think of these numbers as representing the normal temperature, a wide range of temperatures has been found in healthy people.<ref name="CC09"/> 

[[File:Biological clock human.svg|thumb|444px|Variations in body temperature are part of the [[circadian rhythm]] (see at 4:30 and 19:00).]]

In healthy adults, body temperature fluctuates about {{val|0.5|u=°C}} ({{val|0.9|u=°F}}) throughout the day, with lower temperatures in the morning and higher temperatures in the late afternoon and evening, as the body's needs and activities change.<ref name=Longo />  The time of day and other circumstances also affect the body's temperature.  The core body temperature of an individual tends to have the lowest value in the second half of the sleep cycle; the lowest point, called the [[wikt:nadir#Noun|nadir]], is one of the primary markers for [[circadian rhythm]]s.  The body temperature also changes when a person is hungry, sleepy, or cold.

==Methods of measurement==
[[File:Clinical thermometer 38.7.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Medical thermometer|medical/clinical thermometer]] showing the temperature of {{val|38.7|u=°C}}]]

Taking a patient's [[temperature]] is an initial part of a full [[clinical examination]].  Sites used for measurement include:

* In the anus (rectal temperature)
* In the mouth (oral temperature)
* Under the arm (axillary temperature)
* In the ear (tympanic temperature)
* In the [[vagina]] (vaginal temperature)
* On the skin of the forehead
* Over the [[temporal artery]]
* In the gut (by swallowing a small thermometer)

The [[temporal artery]] can also be used.  It is close to the surface of the skin and therefore accessible for reading. The temporal artery is part of the main trunk of the arterial system from the heart.  So long as the patient’s blood flow is permanent and regular, the method allows precise measurement of the temperature.

==Variations==
[[File:Body Temp Variation.png|thumb|250px|Diurnal variation in body temperature, ranging from about {{val|37.5|u=°C}} from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and falling to about {{val|36.4|u=°C}} from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m.]]
Temperature control ([[thermoregulation]]) is part of a [[homeostatic]] mechanism that keeps the organism at optimum [[operating temperature]], as it affects the rate of [[chemical reaction]]s. In [[human]]s the average internal temperature is {{convert|37.0|C}}, though it varies among individuals.  However, no person always has exactly the same temperature at every moment of the day.  Temperatures cycle regularly up and down through the day, as controlled by the person's [[circadian rhythm]].  The  lowest temperature occurs about two hours before the person normally wakes up.  Additionally, temperatures change according to activities and external factors.<ref name="Kelly"/>

In addition to varying throughout the day, normal body temperature may also differ as much as {{val|0.5|u=°C}} ({{val|0.9|u=°F}}) from one day to the next, so that the highest or lowest temperatures on one day will not always exactly match the highest or lowest temperatures on the next day.

Normal human body temperature varies slightly from person to person and by the time of day. Consequently, each type of measurement has a range of normal temperatures.  The range for normal human body temperatures, taken orally, is {{val|36.8|0.5|u=°C}} ({{val|98.2|0.9|u=°F}}).<ref name=Mac />  This means that any oral temperature between {{val|36.3}} and {{val|37.3|u=°C}} ({{val|97.3}} and {{val|99.1|u=°F}}) is likely to be normal.

===Natural rhythms===
Body temperature normally fluctuates over the day, with the lowest levels around 4 a.m. and the highest in the late afternoon, between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m. (assuming the person sleeps at night and stays awake during the day).<ref name="Mac"/><ref name=Longo /> Therefore, an oral temperature of {{convert|37.3|C}} would, strictly speaking, be a normal, healthy temperature in the afternoon but not in the early morning.<ref name=Longo />  An individual's body temperature typically changes by about {{val|0.5|u=°C}} ({{val|0.9|u=°F}}) between its highest and lowest points each day.<ref name=Longo /><ref name=Mac />

Body temperature is sensitive to many hormones, so women have a temperature rhythm that varies with the [[menstrual cycle]], called a ''circamensal'' rhythm.<ref name=Kelly />  A woman's [[basal body temperature]] rises sharply after ovulation, as [[estrogen]] production decreases and [[progesterone]] increases.  [[Fertility awareness]] programs use this predictable change to identify when a woman is able to become [[pregnant]].  During the [[luteal phase]] of the menstrual cycle, both the lowest and the [[mesor|average temperatures]] are slightly higher than during other parts of the cycle.  However, the amount that the temperature rises during each day is slightly lower than typical, so the highest temperature of the day is not very much higher than usual.<ref name="Kelly1"/>  [[Hormonal contraceptive]]s both suppress the circamensal rhythm and raise the typical body temperature by about {{val|0.6|u=°C}} ({{val|1.1|u=°F}}).<ref name=Kelly />

Temperature also varies with the change of [[season]]s during each year.  This pattern is called a ''circannual'' rhythm.<ref name=Kelly1 />  Studies of seasonal variations have produced inconsistent results.  People living in different climates may have different seasonal patterns.

Increased physical fitness increases the amount of daily variation in temperature.<ref name=Kelly1 />

With increased age, both average body temperature and the amount of daily variability in the body temperature tend to decrease.<ref name=Kelly1 /> Elderly patients may have a decreased ability to generate body heat during a fever, so even a [[low-grade fever|somewhat elevated temperature]] can indicate a serious underlying cause in [[geriatrics]].

===Variations due to measurement methods===
Different methods used for measuring temperature produce different results.  The temperature reading depends on which part of the body is being measured.  The typical daytime temperatures among healthy adults are as follows:
* Temperature in the anus (rectum/rectal), vagina, or in the ear (otic) is about {{val|37.5|u=°C}} ({{val|99.5|u=°F}})<ref name="Elert2005"/>
* Temperature in the mouth (oral) is about {{val|36.8|u=°C}} ({{val|98.2|u=°F}})<ref name=Mac />
* Temperature under the arm (axillary) is about {{val|36.5|u=°C}} ({{val|97.7|u=°F}}) <ref name="Elert2005" />

Generally, oral, rectal, gut, and core body temperatures, although slightly different, are well-correlated, with oral temperature being the lowest of the four.  Oral temperatures are generally about 0.4 °C (0.7 °F) lower than rectal temperatures.<ref name=Longo />

Oral temperatures are influenced by drinking, chewing, smoking, and breathing with the mouth open.  Cold drinks or food reduce oral temperatures; hot drinks, hot food, chewing, and smoking raise oral temperatures.<ref name=Kelly />

Axillary (armpit), tympanic (ear), and other skin-based temperatures correlate relatively poorly with core body temperature.<ref name=Kelly1 />  Tympanic measurements run higher than rectal and core body measurements, and axillary temperatures run lower.<ref name=Kelly1 />  The body uses the skin as a tool to increase or decrease core body temperature, which affects the temperature of the skin.  Skin-based temperatures are more variable than other measurement sites.<ref name=Kelly1 /> The peak daily temperature for axillary measurements lags about three hours behind the rest of the body.<ref name=Kelly1 /> Skin temperatures are also more influenced by outside factors, such as clothing and air temperature.

===Variations due to outside factors===
Many outside factors affect the measured temperature as well. "Normal" values are generally given for an otherwise healthy, non-fasting adult, dressed comfortably, indoors, in a room that is kept at a normal room temperature ({{val|22.7}} to {{val|24.4|u=°C}} or {{val|73}} to {{val|76|u=°F}}), during the morning, but not shortly after arising from sleep.  Furthermore, for oral temperatures, the subject must not have eaten, drunk, or smoked anything in at least the previous fifteen to twenty minutes, as the temperature of the food, drink, or smoke can dramatically affect the reading.

Temperature is increased after eating or drinking anything with calories.  Caloric restriction, as for a [[weight-loss diet]], reduces overall body temperature.<ref name=Kelly />  Drinking [[alcohol]] reduces the amount of daily change, slightly lowering daytime temperatures and noticeably raising nighttime temperatures.<ref name=Kelly />

Exercise raises body temperatures.  In adults, a noticeable increase usually requires strenuous exercise or exercise sustained over a significant time.  Children develop higher temperatures with milder activities, like playing.

Psychological factors also influence body temperature:  a very excited person often has an elevated temperature.

Wearing more clothing slows daily temperature changes and raises body temperature.<ref name=Kelly />  Similarly, sleeping with an [[electric blanket]] raises the body temperature at night.<ref name=Kelly />

Sleep disturbances also affect temperatures.  Normally, body temperature drops significantly at a person's normal bedtime and throughout the night.  Short-term [[sleep deprivation]] produces a higher temperature at night than normal, but long-term sleep deprivation appears to reduce temperatures.<ref name=Kelly />  [[Insomnia]] and poor sleep quality are associated with smaller and later drops in body temperature.<ref name=Kelly />  Similarly, waking up unusually early, sleeping in, [[jet lag]] and changes to [[shift work]] schedules may affect body temperature.<ref name=Kelly />

==Specific temperature concepts==
===Fever===
{{Main|Fever}}

A temperature setpoint is the level at which the body attempts to maintain its temperature.  When the setpoint is raised, the result is a fever.  Most fevers are caused by [[infectious disease]] and can be lowered, if desired, with [[antipyretic]] medications.

An early morning temperature higher than 37.2°C (>98.9°F) or a late afternoon temperature higher than 37.7°C (>99.9°F) is normally considered a fever, assuming that the temperature is elevated due to a change in the hypothalamus's setpoint.<ref name=Longo />  Lower thresholds are sometimes appropriate for elderly people.<ref name=Longo />  The normal daily temperature variation is typically 0.5°C (0.9°F), but can be greater among people recovering from a fever.<ref name=Longo /> 

An organism at optimum temperature is considered ''afebrile'' or ''apyrexic'', meaning "without fever".  If temperature is raised, but the setpoint is not raised, then the result is [[hyperthermia]].

===Hyperthermia===
{{Main|Hyperthermia}}

Hyperthermia occurs when the body produces or absorbs more heat than it can dissipate. It is usually caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures. The heat-regulating mechanisms of the body eventually become overwhelmed and unable to deal effectively with the heat, causing the body temperature to climb uncontrollably.  Hyperthermia at or above about {{val|40|u=°C}} ({{val|104|u=°F}}) is a life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate treatment.  Common symptoms include headache, confusion, and fatigue.  If sweating has resulted in dehydration, then the affected person may have dry, red skin.

In a medical setting, mild hyperthermia is commonly called ''heat exhaustion'' or ''heat prostration''; severe hyperthermia is called ''heat stroke''.  Heat stroke may come on suddenly, but it usually follows the untreated milder stages.  Treatment involves cooling and rehydrating the body; fever-reducing drugs are useless for this condition.  This may be done through moving out of direct sunlight to a cooler and shaded environment, drinking water, removing clothing that might keep heat close to the body, or sitting in front of a fan.  Bathing in tepid or cool water, or even just washing the face and other exposed areas of the skin, can be helpful.

With fever, the body's core temperature rises to a higher temperature through the action of the part of the brain that controls the body temperature; with hyperthermia, the body temperature is raised without the consent of the heat control centers.

===Hypothermia===
{{Main|Hypothermia}}

In hypothermia,  body temperature drops below that required for normal metabolism and bodily functions.  In humans, this is usually due to excessive exposure to cold air or water, but it can be [[Therapeutic hypothermia|deliberately induced as a medical treatment]].  Symptoms usually appear when the body's core temperature drops by {{val|1}}-{{val|2|u=°C}} ({{val|1.8}}-{{val|3.6|u=°F}}) below normal temperature.

===Basal body temperature===
{{Main|Basal body temperature}}

Basal body temperature is the lowest temperature attained by the body during rest (usually during sleep). It is generally measured immediately after awakening and before any physical activity has been undertaken, although the temperature measured at that time is somewhat higher than the true basal body temperature.  In women, temperature differs at various points in the [[menstrual cycle]], and this can be used in the long-term to track ovulation both for the purpose of aiding conception or avoiding pregnancy.  This process is called [[fertility awareness]].

===Core temperature===
'''Core temperature''', also called '''core body temperature''', is the operating [[temperature]] of an [[organism]], specifically in deep structures of the body such as the [[liver]], in comparison to temperatures of peripheral tissues.  Core temperature is normally maintained within a narrow range so that essential enzymatic reactions can occur. Significant core temperature elevation ([[hyperthermia]]) or depression ([[hypothermia]]) that is prolonged for more than a brief period of time is incompatible with human life.

Temperature examination in the [[rectum]] is the traditional [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] measurement used to estimate core temperature (oral temperature is affected by hot or cold drinks and mouth-breathing). Rectal temperature is expected to be approximately one Fahrenheit degree higher than an oral temperature taken on the same person at the same time. Ear thermometers measure eardrum temperature using [[infrared]] sensors. The blood supply to the [[tympanic membrane]] is shared with the [[brain]]. However, this method of measuring body temperature is not as accurate as rectal measurement and has a low sensitivity for fevers, missing three or four out of every ten fevers in children.<ref name="Dodd"/> Ear temperature measurement may be acceptable for observing trends in body temperature but is less useful in consistently identifying fevers.

Until recently, direct measurement of core body temperature required surgical insertion of a probe, so a variety of indirect methods have commonly been used.  The [[rectum|rectal]] or [[vagina]]l temperature is generally considered to give the most accurate assessment of core body temperature, particularly in hypothermia. In the early 2000s, ingestible [[thermistor]]s in [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]] form were produced, allowing the temperature inside the [[digestive tract]] to be transmitted to an external receiver; one study found that these were comparable in accuracy to rectal temperature measurement.<ref name="SciDirect"/>

== Human temperature variation effects ==

=== Hot ===

Fevers are not to be confused with heat stroke.  In fever the person can feel cold at high body temperatures since the body is fooled into thinking it is cold by the infectant microbe affecting the point that the body thermostat is set at.  It is literally set higher than usual.

==Measurement devices==
{{Main|Thermometer}}
There is a risk of injury from cracking '''glass thermometers''' if too much force is applied by the teeth to hold them in place, and the [[alcohol]] or [[mercury (element)|mercury]] contents are poisonous.  These older thermometers are gradually being replaced by '''electronic thermometers''' which are made from solid plastic and use a metal ([[thermocouple]]) sensor.

A '''plastic thermometer strip''' placed on the [[forehead]] gives an approximate local reading, which depends to a great extent on ambient air temperature and local circulation effects.  Using a thermometer to record the temperature under the armpit is less affected by surrounding air temperature, but is still prone to diverge from true core temperature if there are alterations in blood circulation.

Since the year 2000, small '''ear thermometers''' have become available. It is thought that the [[eardrum]] closely mirrors core temperature values, and these devices work by detecting the [[infrared]] heat emission from the [[tympanic membrane]]. A measurement is quickly taken within one second, making them popular for use with children.  While the electronic display of the temperature value is easier to read than interpreting the graduation marks on a thermometer, there are some concerns for the accuracy of ear thermometers in home use.<ref name="pmid15644134"/>
