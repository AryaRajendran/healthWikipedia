'''Dutasteride''' (trademark name '''Avodart''', manufactured by [[GlaxoSmithKline]]) is a [[5-alpha-reductase inhibitor|dual 5-a reductase inhibitor]] that [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibits conversion]] of [[testosterone]] to [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT).

Dutasteride is approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for treatment of [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH) and prescribed [[off-label]] for treatment of [[male pattern baldness]] (MPB).

==Medical uses==
===Benign prostatic hyperplasia===
Dutasteride is approved for the treatment of [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH); colloquially known as an "enlarged prostate".

===Male pattern baldness===
Phase I and II clinical trials for dutasteride as a [[Baldness|hair loss]] drug were undertaken, but called off in late 2002, with reasons for termination unreported. 

The phase II results indicated that dutasteride at both 0.5 mg and 2.5 mg/day generated a superior hair count to finasteride 5 mg at 12 and 24 weeks.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Olsen EA, Hordinsky M, Whiting D, ''et al.'' |title=The importance of dual 5alpha-reductase inhibition in the treatment of MPB: results of a randomized placebo-controlled study of dutasteride versus finasteride |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol. |volume=55 |issue=6 |pages=1014–23 |year=2006 |month=Dec |pmid=17110217 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2006.05.007 }}</ref>

In the phase II trials, an expert panel observing a one-inch diameter circle on the vertex of the head reported the following results at 24 weeks:

* Placebo: - 32.3 hairs

* Finasteride 5 mg: + 75.6 hairs

* Dutasteride 0.1 mg: + 78.5 hairs

* Dutasteride 0.5 mg: + 94.6 hairs

* Dutasteride 2.5 mg: + 109.6 hairs

In December 2006, GlaxoSmithKline launched a new phase III, six month study in [[Korea]] to test the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of a once-daily dose of dutasteride (0.5 mg) for the treatment of [[male pattern baldness]] (MPB) in the vertex region of the scalp (types IIIV, IV and V on the [[Hamilton-Norwood scale]]). The study was completed in January 2009.<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00441116}}</ref><ref>[http://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(09)01213-4/abstract Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily in male patients with male pattern hair loss: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study | Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (JAAD)]</ref> Future intentions by GlaxoSmithKline to continue or abandon plans for [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]] approval of dutasteride in treatment of MPB remain unknown.

==Contraindications==
Causes birth defects in male embryos and fetuses, but not in female. Dutasteride has [[teratogenic effect|teratogenic effects]] in male fetuses. It causes abnormalities of physiological development if during [[gestation]] a pregnant woman is exposed to dutasteride. Women who are pregnant should not handle the capsules since dutasteride is absorbed through the skin. 

The adverse effects of dutasteride are identical to [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency]], where a developing male child is naturally deficient in 5-alpha reductase type II, and thus unable to synthesize it. As dutasteride inactivates 5-alpha reductase type II developing males would have the same adverse effects as a result of the drug as they would have with the deficiency.

Men who are taking dutasteride should not donate blood, and due to its long half-life, should also not donate blood for at least 6 months after the cessation of treatment. These precautions are to be taken in order to prevent the potential risk of causing birth defects to the child of a pregnant woman who receives a transfusion with blood that contains dutasteride.<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/avodart.html Avodart Information | Drugs.com]</ref>

===Observed in practice===
The FDA has added a warning to dutasteride about an increased risk of high-grade [[prostate cancer]].<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm258529.htm 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs): Label Change - Increased Risk of Prostate Cancer | U.S. Department of Health & Human Services]</ref> While the potential for positive, negative or neutral changes to the potential risk of developing prostate cancer with dutasteride has not been established, evidence has suggested it may temporarily reduce the growth and prevalence of benign prostate tumors, but could also mask the early detection of prostate cancer. The primary area for concern is for patients who may develop prostate cancer whilst taking dutasteride for benign prostatic hyperplasia, which in turn could delay diagnosis and early treatment of the prostate cancer, thereby potentially increasing the risk of these patients developing high-grade prostate cancer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=PC|title=Chemoprevention of prostate cancer.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=2010 Apr 1|volume=362|issue=13|pages=1237–8|pmid=20357287|doi=10.1056/NEJMe1001045}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Dutasteride belongs to a class of drugs called [[5-alpha-reductase inhibitor]]s, which block the action of the [[5-alpha-reductase]] [[enzyme]]s that convert testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). 

===Dutasteride versus Finasteride===
[[Finasteride]] is also approved for the treatment of [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]], or BPH. In distinction to dutasteride, it currently has formal FDA approval for the treatment of male pattern baldness (MPB). The medications belong to the same [[chemical classification|class]] of [[drugs]]. Dutasteride inhibits two of the three isoforms of 5-alpha reductase, I and II, whereas finasteride only inhibits type II, and has a much shorter half-life. 

Drug related adverse events have been reported to be similar in comparisons of dutasteride and finasteride in BPH in a randomized clinical trial done by GlaxoSmithKline. According to the study:
<blockquote>No significant differences from placebo were observed for any of the treatment groups [comparing finasteride and dutasteride], except for an increased reporting of serious adverse events with 0.01 mg dutasteride. None of the serious adverse events were considered by the investigators to be drug related. The most common adverse events (occurring in 15% or more of patients in at least one treatment group) were: ear, nose, and throat infections; malaise and fatigue; headaches;altered libido; musculoskeletal pain; erectile dysfunction; and dizziness. There were no significant differences in the reporting of the most common adverse events between the active treatment groups and the placebo group apart
from the increased reporting of altered libido in the highest dose dutasteride group (5 mg) and the finasteride group, which both had similar reporting rates.<ref name="hobbs">Clark, RV, Herman DJ, Hobbs S, et al: Marked Suppression of Dihydrotestosterone in Men with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia by Dutasteride, a Dual 5 alpha-Reductase Inhibitor. Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism. 2004;89(5):2179–2184.</ref></blockquote>

This confirmed findings of earlier studies in patients with BPH, comparing the 5 mg dose of finasteride to the 0.5 mg dose of dutasteride.<ref>Andriole GL, Kirby R. Safety and tolerability of the dual 5alpha-reductase inhibitor dutasteride in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Eur Urol. 2003;44:82-88.</ref> The EPICS trial, a 12-month clinical study also done by GlaxoSmithKline, demonstrated treatment with dutasteride and finasteride resulted in similar decreases in prostate volume, with numerically but not statistically significantly greater improvements in symptom scores for the dutasteride group.<ref>[http://www.urotoday.com/images/pdf_files/bjui/bjuiaug1.pdf Managing the progression of lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia: therapeutic options for the man at risk | UroToday]</ref> Finasteride is marketed by [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] under trademark names ''Proscar'' (5 mg/day finasteride) for BPH and ''Propecia'' (1 mg/day finasteride) for MPB. Of note, data from clinical trials has not demonstrated efficacy of a 5 mg dose of finasteride over a 1 mg dose in androgenic alopecia.<ref>[http://www.bernsteinmedical.com/medical-treatment/medications/propecia-finasteride/ Propecia (Finasteride) - ''See "Increasing the Dose"'' | Bernstein Medical Center for Hair Restoration]</ref>
