The '''Somatosensory Rehabilitation of Pain''', is a method whose aim is to treat conditions of a reduced sense of touch or sensation ([[hypoesthesia]]) in order to decrease [[neuropathic pain]]. Neuropathic pain, with a prevalency of 6.9% of the general population, represents an important public health problem.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bouhassira D, Lantéri-Minet M, Attal N, Laurent B, Touboul C|title=Prevalence of chronic pain with neuropathic caracteristics in the general population|journal=Pain|year=2008|pages=380–87|volume=136|issue=3|pmid=17888574|doi=10.1016/j.pain.2007.08.013}}</ref> i.e. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) concerns 2.7% of the general population.;<ref>{{cite journal|author=Atroshi I, Gummesson C, Johnsson R, Ornstein E, Ranstam J, Rosén I|title=Prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome in a general population|journal= JAMA|year=1999|pages=153–8|volume=282|issue=2|pmid=10411196|doi=10.1001/jama.282.2.153}}</ref> i.e. Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) concerns 26/100,000 person-years of the general population.<ref>{{cite journal|author= de Mos M, de Bruijn AG, Huygen FJ, Dieleman JP, Stricker BH, Sturkenboom MC|title= The incidence of complex regional pain syndrome: a population-based study|journal= Pain|year=2007|pages=12–20|volume=129|issue=1-2|pmid=17084977|doi=10.1016/j.pain.2006.09.008}}</ref> Patients with chronic pain need every possible therapy to battle the pain.

== History ==
In 1869, the French surgeon Jean Joseph Emile Létiévant<ref>{{cite journal|author=Spicher C, Kohut G|title=Jean Joseph Emile Létiévant: a review of his contributions to surgery and rehabilitation|journal=J Reconstr Microsurg|year=2001|pages=169–77|volume=17|issue=3 |pmid=11336148|doi=10.1055/s-2001-14348}}</ref> was the first to map the altered sensibility of the cutaneous sense : [[aesthesiography]]. In 1872, after the [[American Civil War]] the American neurologist [[Silas Weir Mitchell]]<ref>Mitchell, S.W. (1872) Injuries of Nerves and their Consequences. Philadelphia: JB Lippincott Co</ref> was the first to observe the correlation between the altered cutaneous fibres and the burning pain that he named [[causalgia]]. For him the cohabitation of altered cutaneous fibres and non-altered was the etiology of this neuropathic pain symptom. In 1909, the British surgeons Wilfred Trotter and H. Morriston Davies studied on volunteers (themselves) the sensory recovery in altered sensibility of the skin.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Trotter W, Davies HM|title= Experimental studies in the innervation of the skin|journal= J Physiol |year=1909|pages=134–246|volume=38|issue=2-3|pmid=16992967|pmc=1533644}}[http://jp.physoc.org/content/38/2-3/134.long]</ref> In 1915, during [[World War I]] the German surgeon Paul Hoffmann<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hoffmann P, Buck-Gramcko D, Lubahn JD.|title= The Hoffmann-Tinel sign |journal=J Hand Surg Br|year=1983|pages=800–5|volume=18|issue=6 |pmid=8308447}}[[:de:Hoffmann-Tinel-Zeichen]]</ref> and the French neurologist Jules Tinel<ref>[http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/3740.html Tinel, J. Nerve wounds. London: Baillère, Tindall and Cox, 1917]</ref> discovered a sign of sensory recovery: the Hoffmann-Tinel or [[Tinel sign]]. In 1954, after [[World War II]], a council of surgeons defined a classification of sensory recovery.<ref>Zachary R B (1954). Results of nerve suture. In H.-J.

In 1979, Ulf Lindblom<ref>{{cite journal|author= Lindblom U, Verrillo RT|title=Sensory functions in chronic neuralgia |journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psych|year=1979|pages=422–35|volume=42|issue=5|pmid=448382|pmc=490230}}[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC490230/?tool=pubmed]</ref>  – at that time the president of [[International Association for the Study of Pain]] - insisted on the fact that pain itself is the centre of concern for both the patient and the physician but the sensory abnormalities which often occur in the painful area are important as well.

== The Somatosensory Rehabilitation Method ==
The aim of somatosensory rehabilitation is to increase the quality of touch or even normalize the sensation of touch in the case of neuropathic pain due to peripheral nerve lesions. Because, when hypoesthesia decreases, [[neuropathic pain]] decreases.<ref>Spicher, C.J. & Clément-Favre, S. (2008).Chronic Neuropathic Pain decreases through Somatosensory Rehabilitation. RAE : Recueil Annuel francophone belge d'Ergothérapie, 1, 25-37 [http://kasitera.asiakkaat.sigmatic.fi/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/spicher-clement-favre-2008.pdf]</ref><ref name="pmid18214230">{{cite journal |author=Mathis F, Desfoux N, Sprumont P, Hecker E, Rossier P, Spicher C |title=Peripheral neuropathic pain relieved by somatosensory rehabilitation. |journal=Rev Med Suisse |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=2745–8 |year=2007 |month=Nov |pmid=18214230}}[http://revue.medhyg.ch/article.php3?sid=32307]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author= Moseley GL, Zalucki N, Weich, K|title=Tactile discrimination, but not tactile stimulation alone, reduces chronic limb pain |journal=Pain|year=2008|pages=600–608|volume=137|pmid=18054437|doi=10.1016/j.pain.2007.10.021}}</ref>
The assessment of partial hypoaesthesia (axonotmesis) is based on the concept of the largest cutaneous distribution of the nerve branch.<ref>Spicher, C.J., Desfoux, N. & Sprumont, P. Atlas des territoires cutanés du corps humain; Esthésiologie de 240 branches. Montpellier, Paris: Sauramps Médical, 2010 [http://www.amazon.ca/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dca-books-english-tree&field-keywords=Atlas+des+territoires+cutan%E9s+du+corps+humain]</ref> The first phase is the mapping which outlines the  hypoaesthetic territory - [[aesthesiography]]. The second phase is the regular and rigorous assessment of the quality of hypoesthesia in terms of pressure perception threshold. This is an important part of this rehabilitation.<ref>Frey von, M.

Sometimes, the hypoaesthetic territory is masked by a patch of skin which is painful to touch and is therefore not accessible. Since 1979, this stimulus induced pain is to be called [[allodynia]] in medicine. The original definition comes from Merksey and Bogduk (1994) “pain due to a stimulus which does not normally provoke pain”.<ref>Merskey, H. & Bogduk, N. (Eds.) Classification of Chronic Pain. Seattle: IASP Task Force on Taxonomy, 1994</ref> In such situations, while doing the diagnostic testing of axonal lesions at the first occupational or physical therapy session, the two point discrimination test<ref>Weber, EH.

[http://doc.rero.ch/lm.php?url=1000,43,2,20080507152616-JF/rouiller_sma.pdf]</ref> hinders other physical treatments. For the reason that, any contact on the hypersensitive territory, although it can be bearable in the moment, can induce several hours of a very painful post-effect or even several sleepless nights. This hypersensitivity to touch is induced by the peripheral nerve lesion of the large myelinated A-beta fibers.<ref name="pmid19242687">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00221-009-1724-6 |author=Devor M |title=Ectopic discharge in Abeta afferents as a source of neuropathic pain |journal=Exp. Brain Res. |volume=196 |issue=1 |pages=115–28 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19242687}}</ref>

In other words, after a peripheral nerve lesion, aberrant sprouting occurs in the dorsal horn which can explain that a non-noxious stimulus is perceived as being noxious.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kohama I, Ishikawa K, Kocsis JD.|title=Synaptic reorganization in the substantia gelatinosa after peripheral nerve neuroma formation: aberrant innervation of lamina II neurons by Abeta afferents.Journal|J Neurosci |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=1538–49 |year=2000 |month=Feb |pmid=10662843 |pmc=2605372 |journal=J. Neurosci.}}</ref> This is one of the explanatory models of the different mechanisms of central sensitization.
