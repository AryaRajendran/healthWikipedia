'''False memory syndrome''' ('''FMS''') describes a condition in which a person's identity and relationships are affected by memories which are factually incorrect but are strongly believed.<ref>{{cite book | ref = harv | last = McHugh | first = PR | authorlink = Paul R.

== Definition ==
False memory syndrome is defined as:
<blockquote>[A] condition in which a person's identity and interpersonal relationships are centered around a memory of traumatic experience which is objectively false but in which the person strongly ''believes''. Note that the syndrome is not characterized by false memories as such. We all have memories that are inaccurate. Rather, the syndrome may be diagnosed when the memory is so deeply ingrained that it ''orients'' the individual's entire personality and lifestyle, in turn disrupting all sorts of other adaptive behavior...False Memory Syndrome is especially destructive because the person assiduously ''avoids confrontation with any evidence'' that might challenge the memory. Thus it takes on a life of its own, encapsulated and ''resistant'' to correction. The person may become so focused on memory that he or she may be effectively ''distracted'' from coping with the real problems in his or her life.{{sfn|McHugh|2008|pp=67–68}} <small>Emphasis in original</small></blockquote>

The concept of FMS has proven controversial,<ref name="Dallam">{{cite journal | last = Dallam | first = S. | year = 2002 | title = Crisis or Creation: A systematic examination of false memory claims | journal = Journal of Child Sexual Abuse | volume = 9 | issue = 3/4 | pages = 9–36 | url = http://www.leadershipcouncil.org/1/res/dallam/6.html |pmid=17521989  | doi = 10.1300/J070v09n03_02 | accessdate = 2008-06-27 }}

and the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] does not include it. [[Paul R. McHugh]], member of the FMSF, stated that the term was not adopted into the fourth version of the manual due to the pertinent committee being headed by believers in [[recovered memory]].{{sfn|McHugh|2008|p=55}}

"Planted memories" differ from false memories in that the sufferer was very suggestible following or during [[hypnotherapy]]. [[Medical ethics]] forbid the practice. The sufferer may not be able to tell which memories are genuine and which are not. [[Confabulation]] resultant from the planting of these memories resolves temporary conflicts in the sufferer's mind but chronic damage may become permanently disabling, resulting in one or more [[personality disorders]].{{Citation needed | date = May 2010}}

"Indoctrinated memories" differ yet again in that the sufferer has been subtly reduced to believe [[propaganda]]. Persons who have been indoctrinated severely enough may never recover any moral perspective, resulting in serious disciplinary problems.{{Citation needed | date = May 2010}}

== Recovered memory therapy ==
{{Main|Recovered memory therapy}}
Recovered memory therapy is used to describe the therapeutic processes and methods that are believed to create false memories and false memory syndrome. These methods include [[hypnosis]], sedatives and probing questions where the therapist believes [[repressed memories]] of [[child sexual abuse|childhood sexual abuse]] or other tramatic events are the cause of their client's problems.{{sfn|McHugh|2008|p=63}} The term is not listed in [[DSM-IV]] or used by any mainstream [[Psychotherapy#Specific schools and approaches|formal psychotherapy modality]].<ref name="Whitfield" />

[[Memory consolidation]] becomes a critical element of false memory and recovered memory syndromes. Once stored in the [[hippocampus]], the memory may last for years or even for life, regardless that the memorized event never actually took place. [[Fixation (psychology)|Obsession]] to a particular false memory, planted memory, or indoctrinated memory can shape a person's actions or even result in [[delusional disorder]].

Mainstream psychiatric and psychological  professional associations now harbor strong skepticism towards the notion of recovered memories of trauma. They{{who|date=September 2011}} argue that self-help books, such as ''[[The Courage to Heal]]'', and recovered memory therapists can influence adults to develop false memories{{citation  needed|date=September 2011}}. According to this theory, psychologists and psychiatrists may accidentally implant these false memories.{{Citation needed | date = April 2008}} The [[American Psychiatric Association]] and [[American Medical Association]] condemn such practices, whether they are formally called "Recovered Memory Therapy" or simply a collection of techniques that fit the description.  In 1998, the Royal College of Psychiatrists Working Group on Reported Recovered Memories of Sexual Abuse wrote:<ref>{{cite journal|title=Recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse: implications for clinical practice|journal=British Journal of Psychiatry|volume=172|pages=296–307|authors=Brandon S, Boakes J, Glaser D & Green R|year=1998}}</ref>

<blockquote><p>No evidence exists for the repression and recovery of verified, severely traumatic events, and their role in symptom formation has yet to be proved. There is also striking absence in the literature of well-corroborated cases of such repressed memories recovered through psychotherapy. Given the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse, even if only a small proportion are repressed and only some of them are subsequently recovered, there should be a significant number of corroborated cases. In fact there are none.</p></blockquote>

That such techniques have been used in the past is undeniable. Their continued use is cause for [[malpractice]] litigation worldwide.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.fortea.us/english/psiquiatria/malpractice.htm | title = Malpractice Suit Against Dr. Bennett Braun | publisher = Fortea.us | date = | accessdate = 2010-12-12 }}</ref> An Australian psychologist was de-registered for engaging in them.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWPST/2010/1.html | title = HEALTH CARE COMPLAINTS COMMISSION v TYNAN [2010&#93; NSWPST 1 | publisher = Austlii.edu.au | date = 10 February 2010 | accessdate = 2010-12-12 }}</ref>

== Evidence for ==
Human [[memory]] is created and highly suggestible, and a wide variety of innocuous, embarrassing and frightening memories can be falsely created through the use of different techniques, including guided imagery, hypnosis and suggestion by others. Though not all individuals who are exposed to these techniques will develop memories, experiments suggest a significant number of people will, and will actively defend the existence of the events, even if told they were false and deliberately implanted. The questions about the possibility of false memories created an explosion of interest in suggestibility of human memory and resulted in an enormous increase in the knowledge about how memories are [[encoding (memory)|encoded]], [[storage (memory)|stored]] and [[recall (memory)|recalled]], producing pioneering experiments such as the [[lost in the mall technique]].<ref>{{cite book | pages = [http://books.google.com/books?id=m8qMjPF1NYAC&pg=PA123 123–30] | last = Schacter | first = DL | title = [[The Seven Sins of Memory|The Seven Sins of Memory: How the Mind Forgets and Remembers]] | publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-618-21919-6 }}</ref> In Roediger and McDermott's (1995) experiment, subjects were presented with a list of related items (such as candy, sugar, honey) to study. When asked to recall the list, participants were just as, if not more, likely to recall semantically related words (such as sweet) than items that were actually studied, thus creating false memories.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roediger|first=Henry L.|coauthors=Kathleen B. McDermott|title=Creating False Memories: Remembering Words Not Presented in Lists|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1995|month=July|volume=21|series=4|pages=803–814|accessdate=10 April 2011}}</ref> This experiment, though widely replicated, remains controversial due to debate considering that people may store semantically related items from a word list [[Concept|conceptually]] rather than as [[language]], which could account for errors in recollection of [[words]] without the creation of false memories.

== Court cases ==

=== Sexual abuse cases ===
The question of the accuracy and dependability of a [[repressed memory]] that someone has later recalled has contributed to some investigations and court cases, including cases of alleged [[sexual abuse]] or [[child sexual abuse]] (CSA).<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.religioustolerance.org/rmt_reli.htm | title = Are Recovered Memories Reliable? | publisher = Religioustolerance.org | date = | accessdate = 2010-12-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/loftus.htm |author=Colleen Born | title = Elizabeth Loftus | publisher = Muskingum.edu | date = | accessdate = 2010-12-12 }}</ref> Some such recollections have been supported by enough corroborating evidence to enable successful prosecution,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Taubman_Center/Recovmem/ | title = The Recovered Memory Project | publisher = Brown.edu | date = 1993-05-03 | accessdate = 2010-12-12 }}</ref> while others have been deemed [[confabulation]]s or "false memories" that were not legally admissible.{{Citation needed | date = January 2008}}

The defense in sexual abuse cases may offer their own "expert testimony to counter the plaintiff's scientific evidence that the mind can avoid or repress traumatic information and then recall it years later." Murphy believes that there is "overwhelming evidence that the mind is capable of repressing traumatic memories of child sexual abuse."<ref>{{Cite news| last = Murphy | first = W. | title = Debunking 'false memory'myths in sexual abuse cases | url = http://www.smith-lawfirm.com/Murphy_Memory_Article.html | accessdate = 2008-01-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080107073650/http://www.smith-lawfirm.com/Murphy_Memory_Article.html |archivedate = 2008-01-07 }}</ref> Whitfield states that the "false memory" defense is "seemingly sophisticated, but mostly contrived and often erroneous." He states that this defense has been created by "accused, convicted and self-confessed child molesters and their advocates" to try to "negate their abusive, criminal behavior."<ref>{{cite journal | last = Whitfield | first = C. | year = 2002 |month=March | title = The "False Memory" Defense Using Disinformation and Junk Science In and Out of Court | journal = Journal of Child Sexual Abuse | volume = 9 | issue = 3/4 | pages = 53–78 | url = http://www.haworthpress.com/store/ArticleAbstract.asp?sid=2LCRMC1PM7DN8N8PNL9M1A42WE7UFG4B&ID=7048 | accessdate = 2008-01-11  | doi = 10.1300/J070v09n03_04 }}</ref> Brown states that when pro-false memory expert witnesses and attorneys state there is no causal connection between CSA and adult psychopathology, that CSA doesn't cause specific trauma-related problems like borderline and dissociative identity disorder, that other variables than CSA can explain the variance of adult psychopathology and that the long-term effects of CSA are non-specific and general, that this testimony is inaccurate and has the potential of misleading juries.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Brown | first = D. | year = 2001 | title = (Mis)representation of the Long-Term Effects of Childhood Sexual Abuse in the Courts | journal =  Journal of Child Sexual Abuse | volume = 9 | issue = 3/4 | pages = 79–107 | url = http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ672709&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ672709 | accessdate = 2008-01-28  | doi = 10.1300/J070v09n03_05 |pmid=17521992 }}</ref>

=== Malpractice cases ===
During the late 1990s, there were multiple lawsuits in the United States in which psychiatrists and psychologists were successfully sued, or settled out of court, on the charge of propagating [[iatrogenic]] memories of [[childhood sexual abuse]], [[incest]] and [[satanic ritual abuse]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/p991201a.html | title = Recovered Memory Lawsuit Sparks Litigation | publisher = Psychiatrictimes.com | date = | accessdate = 2010-12-12 }}</ref>

Some of these suits were brought by individuals who later deemed their [[recovered memories]] of incest and/or satanic ritual abuse to be false. The [[False Memory Syndrome Foundation]] uses the term "retractors" to describe these individuals and have shared their stories publicly.<ref>{{cite book | isbn = 0-88667-045-4 |chapterurl = http://www.stopbadtherapy.com/retracts/macdonald.shtml | year = 1999 | publisher = Laurentian University Press | title = Making of an Illness: My Experience with Multiple Personality Disorder | last = Macdonald | first = G | page = 111 |chapter-url=Women Against Women }}</ref> There is debate regarding the total number of retractions as compared to the total number of allegations,<ref name="Whitfield">{{cite book | last = Whitfield M.D. | first = Charles L. | title = Memory and Abuse&nbsp;– Remembering and Healing the Effects of Trauma | publisher = Health Communications, Inc | year = 1995 |location=Deerfield Beach, FL | page = [http://books.google.com/books?id=z1LW3u1e04YC&pg=PA83 83] | isbn = 1-55874-320-0 }}</ref> and the reasons for retractions.<ref name="Summit">{{cite journal | last = Summit | first = R. | year = 1983 | title = The child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome | journal = Child Abuse & Neglect | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 177–193  | doi =  10.1016/0145-2134(83)90070-4 }}</ref>
