Sinuses are [[mucosa]]-lined airspaces within the bones of the face and skull. The '''frontal sinuses''' are situated behind the [[superciliary arches]].

==Facts==

===Development===

The frontal sinuses are absent at birth, but are generally fairly well developed between the seventh and eighth years, only reaching their full size after [[puberty]]. The [[frontal bone]] is membranous at birth and there is rarely more than a recess until the bone tissue starts to ossify about age two. Consequently this structure does not show on radiographs before that time.   Frontal sinuses are rarely symmetrical and the [[septum]] between them frequently deviates to one or other side of the middle line. Sinus development begins in the womb, but only the [[maxillary sinus|maxillary]] and [[ethmoid sinus]]es are present at birth. Approximately 5% of people have absent frontal sinuses.<ref>[http://www.utmb.edu/otoref/grnds/Sinusitis-acute-9703/sinus-acute-9703.htm The University of Texas Medical Branch, Department of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery]</ref>

===Size===

Their average measurements are as follows: height 28&nbsp;mm, breadth 24&nbsp;mm, depth 20&nbsp;mm, creating a space of 6-7 ml.<ref>[http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:QG1MdzF0FiYJ:www.utmb.edu/otoref/grnds/Paranasal-Sinus-2002-01/Paranasal-sinus-2002-01.doc+Frontal+sinus+function&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=za University of Texas Medical Branch]</ref>

===Location===

Each opens into the anterior part of the corresponding superior meatus of the nose through the [[frontonasal duct]] which traverses the anterior part of the labyrinth of the [[ethmoid]]. These structures then open into the [[hiatus semilunaris]] in the [[middle meatus]].

The mucous membrane in this sinus is innervated by the [[supraorbital nerve]], which carries the [[postganglionic]] [[parasympathetic]] nerve fibers for [[mucus|mucous]] [[secretion]] from the ophthalmic nerve and supplied by the [[supraorbital artery]] and [[anterior ethmoidal artery]].

===Functions===
Through its copious mucus production, the sinus is an essential part of the immune defense/air filtration carried out by the nose. Nasal and sinal mucosae are [[ciliated]] and move mucus to the [[choanae]] and finally to the stomach.  The thick upper layers of nasal mucus trap bacteria and small particles in tissue abundantly provided with [[immune cells]], [[antibodies]], and antibacterial proteins.  The layers beneath are thinner and provide a substrate in which the cilia are able to beat and move the upper layer with its debris through the [[ostium|ostia]] toward the [[choanae]].

====Problems====
Infection of the frontal sinus can give rise to serious complications, as it is in close proximity to the orbit and cranial cavity ([[orbital cellulitis]], [[epidural abscess|epidural]] and [[subdural abscess]], [[meningitis]]).
