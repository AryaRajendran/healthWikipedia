'''Gingival enlargement,''' (sometimes abbreviated to '''GO''') is an increase in the size of the [[gingiva]] (gums). It is a common feature of gingival [[disease]].<ref>Carranza'a Clinical Periodontology, 9th Ed. W.B. Saunders 1996 ISBN 0-7216-8331-2, page 279.</ref>  This is strictly a clinical description of the condition and avoids the erroneous pathologic connotations of terms used in the past such as '''hypertrophic gingivitis''', '''gingival hyperplasia''' or '''gingival hypertrophy'''.  Gingival enlargement can be caused by a number of various stimuli, and "treatment is based on an understanding of the cause and underlying [[pathology|pathologic]] changes."<ref name="Carranza'a Clinical Periodontology page 754">Carranza'a Clinical Periodontology, 9th Ed. W.B. Saunders 1996 ISBN 0-7216-8331-2, page 754.</ref>

==Imprecise use of terminology==
The terms hyperplasia and hypertrophy are not precise descriptions of gingival enlargement because these terms are strictly [[histology|histologic]] [[medical diagnosis|diagnoses]], and such diagnoses require [[microscope|microscopic]] analysis of a tissue sample.  [[Hyperplasia]] refers to an increased number of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s,<ref>Merriam-Webster's Medical Desk Dictionary, 2002, ISBN 1-4018-1188-4, page 367.</ref> and [[hypertrophy]] refers to an increase in the size of individual cells.<ref>Merriam-Webster's Medical Desk Dictionary, 2002, ISBN 1-4018-1188-4, page 368.</ref>  Because these identifications obviously cannot be performed with a clinical examination and evaluation of the tissue,<ref>Oral Pathology Lecture Series Notes, New Jersey Dental School, 2004-2005, page 24.</ref> the term ''gingival enlargement'' is more properly applied.

==Etiology==
===Inflammatory enlargement===
Gingival enlargement may be caused by a multitude of causes.  The most common is [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[inflammation|inflammatory]] gingival enlargement, when the [[gingiva]]e are soft and discolored.  This is caused by tissue [[edema]] and [[infection|infective]] [[cellular infiltration]] caused by prolonged exposure  to [[bacteria]]l plaque, and is treated with conventional [[periodontics|periodontal]] treatment, such as [[scaling and root planing]].<ref name="Carranza'a Clinical Periodontology page 754"/>  

[[Gingivitis]] and gingival enlargement are often seen in [[mouth breathing|mouth breathers]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lite, T, Dimaio, DJ |title=Gingival patterns in mouth breathers: a clinical and histopathologic study and a method of treatment|journal=Oral Surg |issue=8 |pages=382 |year=1955 |doi=10.1016/0030-4220(55)90106-7 |volume=8}}</ref> as a result of irritation brought on by surface dehydration, but the manner in which it is caused has not been demonstrated.<ref name="Carranza'a Clinical Periodontology page 280">Carranza'a Clinical Periodontology, 9th Ed. W.B. Saunders 1996 ISBN 0-7216-8331-2, page 280.</ref>

===Drug-induced enlargement===
This type of gingival enlargement is sometimes termed "drug induced gingival enlargement", abreviated to "DIGO".<ref name="Subramani 2013">{{cite journal|last=Subramani|first=T|coauthors=Rathnavelu, V; Yeap, SK; Alitheen, NB|title=Influence of mast cells in drug-induced gingival overgrowth.|journal=Mediators of inflammation|date=2013|year=2013|month=2|volume=2013|pages=275172|doi=10.1155/2013/275172|pmid=23431239|pmc=3569901}}</ref> Gingival enlargement may also be associated with the administration of three different classes of drugs, all producing a similar response:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Butler, RT, Kalkwarf KL |title=Drug-induced gingival hyperplasia: phenytoin, cyclosporine, and nifedipine|journal=JADA |issue=114 |pages=56 |year=1987}}</ref>
* [[anticonvulsant]]s (such as [[phenytoin]], [[phenobarbital]], [[lamotrigine]], [[valproate]], [[vigabatrin]], [[ethosuximide]], [[topiramate]] and [[primidone]])<ref name="bolognia">{{cite book |author=Bolognia, Jean L. |title=Dermatology |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |display-authors=2}}</ref>
* [[calcium channel blocker]]s, such as [[nifedipine]], [[amlodipine]], and [[verapamil]]. The dihydropyridine derivative isradipidine can replace nifedipine and does not induce gingival overgrowth.<ref name="bolognia"/>
* [[cyclosporine]], an [[immunosuppresant]].<ref name="bolognia"/>

Of all cases of DIGO, about 50% are attributed to phenytoin, 30% to cyclosporins and the remaining 10-20% to calcium channel blockers.

===Enlargement associated with systemic factors===
Many systemic diseases can develop oral manifestations that may include gingival enlargement, some that are related to conditions and others that are related to disease:<ref>Carranza'a Clinical Periodontology, 9th Ed. W.B. Saunders 1996 ISBN 0-7216-8331-2, page 285.</ref>
* Conditioned enlargement
** [[pregnancy]]
** [[puberty]]
** [[vitamin C]] deficiency
** nonspecific, such as a [[pyogenic granuloma]]
* Systemic disease causing enlargement
** [[leukemia]]
** granulolomatous diseases, such as [[Wegener's granulomatosis]] and [[sarcoidosis]]
** [[neoplasm]]
*** [[benign]] neoplasms, such as [[fibroma]]s, [[papilloma]]s and [[giant cell granuloma]]s
*** [[malignant]] neoplasms, such as a [[carcinoma]] or [[malignant melanoma]]
** false gingival enlargements, such as when there is an underlying [[alveolar bone|bony]] or dental tissue [[lesion]]

==Risk factors==
===Inflammatory enlargement===
The accumulation and retention of [[dental plaque|plaque]] is the chief cause of inflammatory gingival enlargement.  Risk factors include poor [[oral hygiene]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hirschfield, I |title=Hypertrophic gingivitis; its clinical aspect|journal=JADA |issue=19 |pages=799 |year=1932}}</ref> as well as physical irritation of the gingiva by improper [[dental restoration|restorative]] and [[orthodontic appliance]]s.<ref name="Carranza'a Clinical Periodontology page 280"/>

===Drug-induced enlargement===
Drug-induced enlargement has been associated with a patient's [[genetic predisposition]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hassell, TM |title=Hypertrophic Oral problems and genetic aspects of individuals with epilepsy|journal=Periodontology 2000|issue=6 |pages=68 |year=1994 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0757.1994.tb00027.x |volume=6 |last2=Burtner |first2=A. Paul |last3=McNeal |first3=Donald |last4=Smith |first4=Robert G.}}</ref> and its association with inflammation is debated.  Some investigators assert that underlying inflammation is necessary for the development of drug-induced enlargement,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ciancio, SG |title=Gingival hyperplasia and diphenylhydantoin |journal=J Perio |issue=43 |pages=411|year=1972}}</ref> while others purport that the existing enlargement induced by the drug effect compounds plaque retention, thus furthering the tissue response.<ref>Carranza'a Clinical Periodontology, 9th Ed. W.B. Saunders 1996 ISBN 0-7216-8331-2, page 282.</ref>

==Management==
The first line management of gingival overgrowth is improved [[oral hygiene]], ensuring that the irritative plaque is removed from around the necks of the teeth and gums. Situations in which the chronic inflammatory gingival enlargement include significant [[fibrosis|fibrotic]] components that do not respond to and undergo shrinkage when exposed to scaling and root planing are treated with surgical removal of the excess tissue, most often with a procedure known as [[gingivectomy]].<ref name="Carranza'a Clinical Periodontology page 754"/>

In DIGO, improved oral hygiene and plaque control is still important to help reduce any inflammatory component that may be contributing to the overgrowth. Reversing and preventing gingival enlargement caused by drugs is as easy as ceasing drug therapy or substituting to another drug.  However, this is not always an option; in such a situation, alternative drug therapy may be employed, if possible, to avoid this deleterious [[Adverse effect|side effect]].  In the case of immunosuppression, [[tacrolimus]] is an available alternative which results in much less severe gingival overgrowth than ciclosporin, but is similarly as [[nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxic]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Spencer, CM |title=Tacrolimus: an update of its pharmacology and drug efficacy in the management of organ transplantation |journal=Drugs |issue=6 |pages=925â€“75 |year=1997 |pmid=9421697 |last2=Goa |first2=KL |last3=Gillis |first3=JC |volume=54}}</ref>  The dihydropyridine derivative isradipidine can replace nifedipine for some uses of calcium channel blocking and does not induce gingival overgrowth.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Westbrook, P |title=Regression of nifedipine-induced gingival hyperplasia following switch to a same class calcium channel blocker, isradipine |journal=J Perio |issue=68|pages=645|year=1997}}</ref>
==Other animals==
[[File:Gingival hyperplasia.JPG|thumb|Gingival hyperplasia]]
It is commonly seen in [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer dogs]] and other [[cephalic index|brachycephalic]] breeds,<ref>{{cite web | title = Gingival Fibroma and Epulides | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/20410.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-08 }}</ref> and in the [[English Springer Spaniel]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Gorrel | first = Cecilia | title = Periodontal Disease | work = Proceedings of the 28th World Congress of the World Small Animal Veterinary Association | year = 2003 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2003&PID=6522&O=Generic | accessdate = 2007-03-25 }}</ref>  It usually starts around middle age and progresses.  Some areas of the gingiva can become quite large but have only a small attachment to the rest of the gingiva, and it may completely cover the teeth.  Infection and inflammation of the gingiva is common with this condition.  Under anesthesia, the enlarged areas of gingiva can be cut back with a scalpel blade, but it usually recurs.  Gingival enlargement is also a potential sequela of [[gingivitis]].  As in humans, it may be seen as a side effect to the use of [[ciclosporin]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=GuaguÃ¨re E, Steffan J, Olivry T |title=Cyclosporin A: a new drug in the field of canine dermatology |journal=Vet Dermatol |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=61â€“74 |year=2004 |pmid=15030555 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3164.2004.00376.x}}</ref>
