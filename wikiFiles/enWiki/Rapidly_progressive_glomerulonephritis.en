'''Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis''' ('''RPGN''') is a [[syndrome]] of the [[kidney]] that is characterized by a rapid loss of renal function,<ref name=McGraw-Hill>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/rapidly+progressive+glomerulonephritis TheFreeDictionary > rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis] Citing: McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine. 2002</ref><ref name=emedicine>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/239504-overview eMedicine > Glomerulonephritis, Crescentic] Author: Malvinder S Parmar. Updated: Sep 25, 2008</ref> (usually a 50% decline in the [[glomerular filtration rate]] (GFR) within 3 months)<ref name=emedicine/> with glomerular '''crescent formation''' seen in at least 50%<ref name=emedicine/> or 75%<ref name=McGraw-Hill/> of glomeruli seen on kidney biopsies. If left untreated, it rapidly progresses into [[acute renal failure]]<ref>{{DorlandsDict|four/000045115|rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis}}</ref> and death within months. In 50% of cases, RPGN is associated with an underlying disease such as [[Goodpasture syndrome]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], or [[Wegener granulomatosis]]; the remaining cases are [[idiopathic]]. Regardless of the underlying cause, RPGN involves severe injury to the kidneys' [[glomeruli]], with many of the glomeruli containing characteristic [[glomerular crescent]]s ([[crescent]]-shaped [[scar]]s).<ref name="urlRenal Pathology">{{cite web |url=http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/RENAHTML/RENAL092.html |title=Renal Pathology |work= |accessdate=2008-11-25}}</ref> Because of this microscopic feature, RPGN is also called '''crescentic glomerulonephritis'''.<ref name="urliROCKET Learning Module: Glomerular Pathology, Case I">{{cite web |url=http://missinglink.ucsf.edu/lm/IDS_102_cases_glomerular/Nephritic_syndrome.htm |title=iROCKET Learning Module: Glomerular Pathology, Case I |work= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="urlRenal Pathology">{{cite web |url=http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/RENAHTML/RENAL092.html |title=Renal Pathology |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Most types of RPGN are characterized by severe and rapid loss of kidney function featuring severe [[hematuria]] (blood in the urine), [[red blood cell cast]]s in the urine, and [[proteinuria]] (protein in the urine), sometimes exceeding 3 g protein/24 h, a range associated with [[nephrotic syndrome]]. Some patients also experience [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure) and [[edema]]. Severe disease is characterized by pronounced [[oliguria]] or [[anuria]], which portends a poor prognosis.<ref name="robbins"/>

The clinical picture is consistent with [[nephritic syndrome]], although the degree of proteinuria may occasionally exceed 3 [[gram|g]]/24 h, a range associated with [[nephrotic syndrome]]. Untreated disease may progress to decreased urinary volume ([[oliguria]]), which is associated with poor kidney function.

==Diagnosis==
[[Serology|Serum analysis]] often aids in the diagnosis of a specific underlying disease. The presence of anti-GBM antibodies suggests type I RPGN; [[antinuclear antibodies]] (ANA) may support a diagnosis of [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] and type II RPGN; and type III and idiopathic RPGN are frequently associated with ANCA-positive serum.<ref name="robbins"/>

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the underlying disease process. For example, [[plasmapheresis]], [[corticosteroid]]s, and [[cytotoxic]] drugs may promote recovery in Goodpasture syndrome, a cause of type I RPGN. Despite even early treatment, however, many patients with RPGN may ultimately require [[dialysis]] and possibly [[renal transplant]].

==Classification==
RPGN can be classified into three types, based upon the [[immunofluorescence]] patterns.<ref name="isbn1-4200-8478-X">{{cite book |author=Ghosh, Amit K. |title=Mayo Clinic Internal Medicine Review: Eighth Edition (Mayo Clinic Internal Medicine Review) |publisher=Informa Healthcare |location= |year=2008 |pages=694 |isbn=1-4200-8478-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

* In type I RPGN, which accounts for approximately 20% of RPGN cases, injury is caused by [[antibodies]] directed against the [[glomerular basement membrane]]. 
* Type II RPGN accounts for roughly 25% of RPGN cases and is characterized by the deposition of [[immune complex]]es in the glomerulus. 
* The remainder of RPGN cases are type III, or [[pauci-immune]] RPGN, which features antibodies directed against [[neutrophil]]s ([[anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies]], ANCA).

===Type I===
Accounting for approximately 20% of RPGN, type I RPGN is characterized by the presence of [[autoantibodies]] directed against the [[glomerular basement membrane]] (GBM). It is also called anti-GBM glomerulonephritis. The antibodies are directed against a particular protein found in the GBM, [[type IV collagen]], specifically the noncollagenous region of its α<sub>3</sub> chain.<ref name="robbins">{{cite book |author=Cotran, Ramzi S.; Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelson; Nelso Fausto; Robbins, Stanley L.; Abbas, Abul K. |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, MO |year=2005 |pages=pp976–8 |isbn=0-7216-0187-1 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>

In addition to the anti-GBM antibodies, some cases of type I RPGN are also associated with antibodies directed against the [[basement membrane]] of lung [[alveoli]], producing [[Goodpasture syndrome]]. The majority of type I disease, however, features anti-GBM antibodies alone; these cases are considered idiopathic.<ref name="robbins"/>

===Type II===
RPGN caused by the deposition of [[immune complex]]es accounts for 25% of RPGN and is classified as type II. Thus any [[immune complex disease]] that involves the glomerulus may progress to RPGN if severe enough. These diseases include [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[acute proliferative glomerulonephritis]], [[Henoch-Schönlein purpura]], and [[IgA nephropathy]].<ref name="robbins"/> While [[polyarteritis nodosa]] also involves [[vasculitis]] associated immune complex deposition that can lead to renal failure, it is not considered part of type-II RPGN because it mainly affects medium sized vessels and does not necessarily involve the kidneys. 

===Type III===
Also known as [[pauci-immune]] RPGN, type III RPGN accounts for 55% of RPGN and features neither immune complex deposition nor anti-GBM antibodies. Instead, the glomeruli are damaged in an undefined manner, perhaps through the activation of [[neutrophil]]s in response to [[anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies]] (ANCA). Type III RPGN may be isolated to the glomerulus (primary, or idiopathic) or associated with a systemic disease (secondary). In most cases of the latter, the systemic disease is an ANCA-associated [[vasculitis]] such as [[Wegener granulomatosis]], [[microscopic polyangiitis]], or [[Churg-Strauss syndrome]].<ref name="robbins"/>

Classification of type III RPGN into primary or secondary may be unnecessary, as primary type III RPGN and secondary type III RPGN may represent a spectrum of the same disease process.<ref name="robbins"/>

The ANCA form may have a more favorable response to treatment than other forms.<ref name="pmid17078867">{{cite journal |author=Alexopoulos E, Gionanlis L, Papayianni E, Kokolina E, Leontsini M, Memmos D |title=Predictors of outcome in idiopathic rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (IRPGN) |journal=BMC Nephrol |volume=7|pages=16 |year=2006 |pmid=17078867 |pmc=1660564 |doi=10.1186/1471-2369-7-16 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2369/7/16}}</ref>

===Type IV===
Type 4 has features of both types 1 and 3. This is also called "double-antibody" positive disease.

==Crescent formation==
[[File:Crescentic glomerulonephritis (1).jpg|thumb|Crescentic glomerulonephritis]]

Despite the wide variety of diseases that cause RPGN, all types of RPGN are characterized by glomeruluar injury and the formation of crescents. Severe injury and GBM rupture leads to the leakage of [[plasma protein]]s through the GBM. Of these proteins, [[fibrin]] is thought to contribute most strongly to crescent formation. [[Epithelial cell]]s lining the [[Bowman capsule]] respond to the leaked fibrin and proliferate. Infiltrating [[white blood cell]]s such as [[monocyte]]s and [[macrophage]]s may also proliferate. These proliferating cells surround and compress the glomerulus, forming a crescent-shaped scar that is readily visible on [[light microscopy]] of a [[renal biopsy]].<ref name="robbins"/>
