The operation also has a rapid response Mercedes car for the crew to use in the event that the helicopter is grounded for any reason.  This vehicle was donated in May 2009 by Sussex Police, having formerly been one of their traffic patrol vehicles.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Mid Sussex Citizen|date=6 May 2009|title=Police gift is boost for rapid response|page=1}}</ref>
