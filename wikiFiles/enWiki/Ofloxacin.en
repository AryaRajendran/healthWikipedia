Ofloxacin was first patented in 1982 (European Patent Daiichi) and received approval from the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) on December 28, 1990. Ofloxacin is sold under a wide variety of brand names as well as [[generic drug]] equivalents, for oral and intravenous administration. Ofloxacin is also available for topical use, as [[eye drop]]s and [[ear drop]]s (marketed as Ocuflox and Floxin Otic respectively in the United States).  

Ofloxacin is a [[racemic]] mixture, which consists of 50% [[levofloxacin]] (the biologically active component) and 50% of its “mirror image” or [[enantiomer]] dextrofloxacin.<ref>http://www.wvnd.uscourts.gov/Opinions/orthoorder.pdf</ref> When levofloxacin disks were not available in early clinical trials, a 5-pg ofloxacin disk was substituted.

Ofloxacin was first patented in 1982 (European Patent Daiichi) and received [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval December 28, 1990. One of the first major adverse reactions noted with Ofloxacin were psychiatric in nature.

The otic solution continues to be listed as being available both as an original drug as well as a generic equivalent.

During the 2008 Johnson & Johnson shareholder’s meetings, the safety of both ofloxacin and levofloxacin were called into question.  Paul Cahan, a shareholder who had suffered severe and continuing adverse reactions to ofloxacin, publicly challenged Johnson and Johnson’s CEO, William Weldon, to adhere to the company’s credo.  This credo states in part “to put the needs and well-being of the people we serve first”. Mr. Cahan requested additional warnings be added to the package inserts for both ofloxacin and levofloxacin.<ref name="investor.jnj.com">http://www.investor.jnj.com/webcasts-presentations.cfm 2009 shareholders meeting; time stamped at 1 hour 42 minutes.</ref><ref name="fqresearch.org">http://fqresearch.org/j_and_j.</ref><!--which webcast is this?

During the 2009 meeting, yet another shareholder who alleges to have been crippled by these drugs, raised these same issues having seen no significant changes in the warnings (regarding the issues raised during the 2008 meeting). Once again a public request for stronger warnings for both ofloxacin and levofloxacin was made.  Though the FDA requested additional [[Black Box Warnings]] concerning the tendon issues in 2008, these warnings were still not present in the inserts for ofloxacin or levofloxacin that are being dispensed by pharmacists in 2009, prompting this second request by a shareholder for stronger warnings and Dear Doctor Letters

Prescribing ofloxacin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a [[prophylactic]] indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of severe adverse drug reactions.<ref name=ftot/>

==Available forms==
Ofloxacin for systemic use is available as tablet(multiple strengths), oral solution (250&nbsp;mg/mL), and injectable solution (multiple strengths). It is also used as eye drops and ear drops. It is also available in combination with [[ornidazole]].

==Mode of action==
Ofloxacin is a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] that is active against both
[[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] bacteria.  It functions by inhibiting [[DNA gyrase]], a type II [[topoisomerase]], and topoisomerase IV,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Drlica K, Zhao X |title=DNA gyrase, topoisomerase IV, and the 4-quinolones |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=377–92 |date=1 September 1997|pmid=9293187 |pmc=232616 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9293187 }}</ref> which is an enzyme necessary to separate (mostly in prokaryotes, in bacteria in particular) replicated DNA, thereby inhibiting bacterial cell division.

The fluoroquinolones interfere with DNA replication by inhibiting an enzyme complex called DNA gyrase. This can also affect mammalian cell replication. In particular, some [[Congener (chemistry)|congeners]] of this drug family display high activity not only against bacterial topoisomerases, but also against eukaryotic topoisomerases and are toxic to cultured mammalian cells and ''[[in vivo]]'' tumor models. Although the quinolone is highly toxic to mammalian cells in culture, its mechanism of [[cytotoxic]] action is not known. Quinolone induced DNA damage was first reported in 1986.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hussy P, Maass G, Tümmler B, Grosse F, Schomburg U |title=Effect of 4-quinolones and novobiocin on calf thymus DNA polymerase alpha primase complex, topoisomerases I and II, and growth of mammalian lymphoblasts |journal=Antimicrob.

==Contraindications==
As noted above, under licensed use, ofloxacin is now considered to be [[contraindicated]] for the treatment of certain sexually transmitted diseases by some experts due to bacterial resistance.<ref name="nycms.org"/>

Due to growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance to the fluoroquinolones in southeast Asia, the use of ofloxacin in patients who have been to southeast Asia is increasingly being contraindicated.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Fluoroquinolone resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae—Colorado and Washington, 1995 |journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. |volume=44 |issue=41 |pages=761–4 |year=1995 |month= October|pmid=7565558 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00039305.htm |author1=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref>

Ofloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population, [[pregnancy]], nursing mothers, patients with psychiatric illnesses and in patients with [[epilepsy]] or other seizure disorders.

===Pregnancy===
Research indicates that the fluoroquinolones can rapidly cross the blood-placenta and blood-milk barrier, and are extensively distributed into the fetal tissues. Peak concentration in human breast milk is similar to levels attained in [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Breast-feeding mothers who take ofloxacin may expose their infants to severe adverse reactions.

The data on the safety of the fluoroquinolones in pregnancy contains conflicting reports and is to be considered incomplete due to the lack of adequate studies.  But it should be noted that several studies have reported spontaneous abortions following the exposure to the fluoroquinolones during pregnancy, as well as therapeutic/elective abortions due to the perceived, as well as actual, risk of birth defects.<ref name="Schaefer C, Amoura-Elefant E, Vial T, et al 1996 83–9">{{cite journal |author=Schaefer C, Amoura-Elefant E, Vial T |title=Pregnancy outcome after prenatal quinolone exposure.

In regards to Floxin, within a prospective follow-up study of 93 women treated with ofloxacin during pregnancy, the authors report that there was a higher than expected (11.9%) malformation rate among the infants.<ref name="Schaefer-1996">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Schaefer | first1 = C. | last2 = Amoura-Elefant | first2 = E. | last3 = Vial | first3 = T. | last4 = Ornoy | first4 = A. | last5 = Garbis | first5 = H. | last6 = Robert | first6 = E. | last7 = Rodriguez-Pinilla | first7 = E. | last8 = Pexieder | first8 = T. | last9 = Prapas | first9 = N. | title = Pregnancy outcome after prenatal quinolone exposure.

For this reason the prescribing of ofloxacin is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of spontaneous abortions and birth defects. Such spontaneous abortions and birth defects have also been found with other drugs within this class, i.e. [[Ciprofloxacin]],<ref>Schluter (1989), Bomford et al (1993), Rosa (1993) Michigan MSS, and Schaefer et al (1996)</ref> [[Pefloxacin]],<ref>Schaefer et al (1996)</ref> [[Norfloxacin]]<ref>Rosa (1993) Michigan MSS</ref> and [[Nalidixic acid]].<ref>Deonna and Guignard (1974), Asscher (1977), Murray (1981), Czeizel et al (2001) Hyngarian CCSCA, and (Belton and Jones 1965)</ref> It is generally accepted that the fluoroquinolone class should not be used to treat women who are pregnant due to such risks.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Sullivan | first1 = Donald L. | title = The expectant mother's guide to prescription and nonprescription drugs, vitamins, home remedies, and herbal products | year = 2001 | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | location = New York  | isbn = 0-312-25190-4 | pages = 55–56 }}</ref><ref>Compliance a Key Consideration: Fewer Options in Pregnancy 
http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/406494_9 “Tetracyclines (e.g. doxycycline) and fluoroquinolones (e.g. ofloxacin) should not be used to treat women who are pregnant because of associated adverse events in the fetus. “</ref><ref>http://www.healthline.com/yodocontent/pregnancy/treatment-chlamydial-infection.html “The treatment for gonorrhea in pregnant women is essentially the same as in non-pregnant women.

===Pediatric use===
Oral and IV fluoroquinolones including ofloxacin are not licensed by the FDA for use in children due to the risk of permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system.  Within one study it was stated that the pediatric patient has a 3.8% chance of experiencing a serious musculoskeletal adverse event.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Noel GJ, Bradley JS, Kauffman RE |title=Comparative safety profile of levofloxacin in 2523 children with a focus on four specific musculoskeletal disorders |journal=Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. |volume=26 |issue=10 |pages=879–91 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17901792 |doi= 10.1097/INF.0b013e3180cbd382|url= }}</ref>

However the two most recent pediatric studies involving the use of [[levofloxacin]], the biologically active component of floxin, indicates that the pediatric patient has a greater than 50% chance of experiencing one or more adverse reactions. Which would be consistent with the studies found within the NDA (new drug application) for Levofloxacin<ref name="accessdata.fda.gov"/> which showed and ADR rate in excess of 40%, as well as a number of reported fatalities. Within the first study<ref>{{cite web| url = http://download.veritasmedicine.com/PDF/CR002392_CSR.pdf| title = SYNOPSIS | accessdate = January 29, 2009| location = USA}}</ref> it is stated that “Of the 712 subjects evaluable for safety, 275 (52%) levofloxacin-treated subjects experienced one or more adverse event.... Serious adverse events were reported in 33 (6%) levofloxacin-treated subjects.... Two serious adverse events in levofloxacin-treated subjects resulted in fatal outcomes.” Within the second study<ref>{{cite web| url = http://download.veritasmedicine.com/PDF/CR002389_CSR.pdf| title = SYNOPSIS | accessdate = January 29, 2009| location = USA}}</ref> it is stated that “Of the 204 subjects evaluable for safety, 122 experienced one or more adverse events...Twelve subjects (6%) discontinued study drug due to an adverse event.... Seven subjects (3%) experienced 8 serious adverse events.” (circa 2007)

As such the current ban on the use of ofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones in the pediatric population appears to be both reasonable and supported by various clinical studies. The risk of permanent injury may outweigh the potential benefits. Within the United States the FDA has stated that it is their intention to pursue the licensing of the fluoroquinolones for pediatric use in spite of the evidence presented at that 62 Meeting of the Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee (1996) that the fluoroquinolones cause irreversible joint damage in the pediatric population.<ref>{{cite web |title=FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, ANTI-INFECTIVE DRUGS ADVISORY COMMITTEE, 62nd MEETING, Wednesday, November 19 |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/AC/97/transcpt/3349t1.rtf |publisher=FDA |location=USA |archiveurl=http://fqresearch.org/pdf_files/62nd_fda_meeting.pdf |archivedate=2009 }}</ref>

As with all fluoroquinolones, there is a possibility of spontaneous tendon rupture.<ref name=Khaliq>{{cite journal |author=Khaliq Y, Zhanel GG |title=Fluoroquinolone-associated tendinopathy: a critical review of the literature |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=36 |issue=11 |pages=1404–10 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12766835 |doi=10.1086/375078}}</ref> Such ruptures may occur both during therapy and long after therapy has been discontinued; there are documented cases where rupture has occurred six months after therapy.<ref name=Khaliq/> The risk of tendon damage is greater in people taking [[corticosteroids]] and in the elderly.<ref name=FDA>{{cite press release |url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2008/NEW01858.html |title=FDA Requests Boxed Warnings on Fluoroquinolone Antimicrobial Drugs |publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] |accessdate= October 11, 2008 |date=July 8, 2008}}</ref> Since July 2008, all systemic fluoroquinolones (those [[route of administration|taken internally]], not as [[eye drop]]s or [[ear drop]]s) available in the United States were requested, by the FDA, to carry a [[black box warning]] of the risk of tendon damage.  However, the addition of this warning was not mandatory.<ref name=FDA/>

==Interactions==
Ofloxacin has been reported to interact with a significant number of other drugs, as well as a number of herbal and natural supplements. Such interactions increased the risk of [[cardiotoxicity]] and [[arrhythmias]], [[anticoagulant]] effects, the formation of non-absorbable complexes, as well as increasing the risk of toxicity.<ref name="drugbank.ca">{{cite web |title=Showing drug card for Ofloxacin (DB01165) |url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01165 |publisher=DrugBank |location=Canada |date=February 19, 2009 }}</ref> Concurrent administration of ofloxacin, with [[magnesium]] or aluminium antacids, [[sucralfate]] or products containing [[calcium]], [[iron]] or [[zinc]] may substantially decrease the absorption of ofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.

Specific drug interaction studies do not appear to have been conducted with ofloxacin. However, the systemic administration of some fluoroquinolones has been shown to interfere with the metabolism of caffeine, elevate plasma concentrations of [[theophylline]] and enhance the effects of the [[warfarin]] and its derivatives. Some fluoroquinolones exert an inhibitory effect on the [[cytochrome P-450]] system, thereby reducing theophylline clearance and increasing theophylline blood levels. Co-administration may dangerously increase coumadin warfarin activity, therefore [[International Normalized Ratio]] (INR) should be monitored closely. Such drug interactions appear to be related to the structural changes of the quinolone ring and the inhibitory effect on the cytochrome P-450 system. As such, these drug interactions involving the fluoroquinolones appear to be drug specific rather than a class effect.

The use of [[NSAID]]s (Non Steroid Anti Inflammatory Drugs) while undergoing fluoroquinolone therapy is contra-indicated due to the risk of severe CNS adverse reactions, including but not limited to seizure disorders. Fluoroquinolones with an unsubstituted piperazinyl moiety at position 7 have the potential to interact with NSAIDs and/or their metabolites, resulting in antagonism of GABA neurotransmission.<ref>{{cite journal |issn= 0305-7453|pmid=8056688 |year= 1994 |month= April|author= Domagala, Jm |title= Structure-activity and structure-side-effect relationships for the quinolone antibacterials |volume= 33 |issue= 4 |pages= 685–706 |journal= The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy |doi= 10.1093/jac/33.4.685}}</ref> Patients have reported reactions to NSAIDS long after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy, but there does not appear to be any research that would either confirm or deny this association other than these anecdotal reports.

The fluoroquinolones have been shown to increase the anticoagulant effect of [[Acenocoumarol]], [[Anisindione]], and [[Dicumarol]]. Additionally there is an increase the risk of cardiotoxicity and arrhythmias when co administered with drugs such as [[Dihydroquinidine]] barbiturate, [[Quinidine]], and Quinidine barbiturate.<ref name="drugbank.ca"/> The fluoroquinolones have also been reported to interact with the GABA A receptor and cause [[neurological]] symptoms; this effect is augmented by certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brouwers JR |title=Drug interactions with quinolone antibacterials |journal=Drug Saf |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=268–81 |year=1992 |pmid=1524699 |doi=10.2165/00002018-199207040-00003 |month= July|first1=JR |issn=0114-5916 }}</ref>

Current or past treatment with oral [[corticosteroids]] is associated with an increased risk of Achilles tendon rupture, especially in elderly patients who are also taking the fluoroquinolones.<ref>{{cite journal |author=van der Linden PD, Sturkenboom MC, Herings RM, Leufkens HM, Rowlands S, Stricker BH |title=Increased risk of achilles tendon rupture with quinolone antibacterial use, especially in elderly patients taking oral corticosteroids |journal=Arch.

A possible interaction between oral [[hypoglycemic]] drugs (e.g., [[glyburide]]/[[glibenclamide]]) or with insulin and fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents have been reported resulting in a potentiation of the hypoglycemic action of these drugs.<ref name=ftot/>

==Overdose==
There is only limited information on overdose with ofloxacin. Current advise for the management of an acute overdose of ofloxacin is emptying of the stomach, along with close observation, and making sure that the patient is appropriately hydrated. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is of only limited effectiveness.<ref name=ftot/> Overdose may result in [[central nervous system]] toxicity, [[cardiovascular]] toxicity, tendon/[[articular]] toxicity, and [[hepatic]] toxicity<ref name=Gold2006>{{cite book |author=Nelson, Lewis H.; Flomenbaum, Neal; Goldfrank, Lewis R.; Hoffman, Robert Louis; Howland, Mary Deems; Neal A.

==Pharmacology==
The [[bioavailability]] of ofloxacin in the tablet form is approximately 98% following oral administration reaching maximum serum concentrations within one to two hours. Between 65% and 80% of an administered oral dose of ofloxacin is excreted unchanged via the kidneys within 48 hours of dosing. Therefore elimination is mainly by [[renal]] excretion. However, four to eight percent of an ofloxacin dose is excreted in the feces. This would indicate a small degree of [[biliary]] excretion as well. Plasma [[elimination half-life]] is approximately 4 to 5 hours in patients and approximately 6.4 to 7.4 hours in elderly patients.<ref name=ftot/>

==Pharmacokinetics==
"After multiple-dose administration of 200&nbsp;mg and 300&nbsp;mg doses, peak serum levels of 2.2 μg/mL and 3.6 μg/mL, respectively, are predicted at steady-state. In vitro, approximately 32% of the drug in plasma is protein bound. Floxin is widely distributed to body tissues. Ofloxacin has been detected in blister fluid, cervix, lung tissue, ovary, prostatic fluid, prostatic tissue, skin, and sputum. Pyridobenzoxazine ring appears to decrease the extent of parent compound metabolism. Less than 5% is eliminated by the kidneys as desmethyl or N-oxide metabolites; 4% to 8% by feces."<ref name=ftot/><ref>{{cite web |author=Drugs.com |title=Complete Ofloxacin information from Drugs.com |url=http://www.drugs.com/ppa/ofloxacin.html }}</ref>
 
There are a number of the endogenous compounds that have been reported to be affected by ofloxacin as inhibitors, alteraters and depletors. See the latest package insert for Ofloxacin for additional details.<ref name=ftot/>

==Dosage==
Ofloxacin should ''only'' be administered as described within the Dosage Guidelines table found within the most current package insert. The status of the patient’s renal function and hepatic function ''must'' also be taken into consideration to avoid an accumulation that may lead to a fatal drug overdose. Ofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion. However, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the liver. Modification of the dosage ''is'' required using the table found within the package insert for those with impaired liver or kidney function (Particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction). However, since the drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. The duration of treatment depends upon the severity of infection and the usual duration is 7 to 14 days.<ref name=ftot/>
  
NOTE: The patient’s serum levels should be monitored during therapy to avoid a drug overdose. See the most current Package Insert for proper dosing guidelines and relevant warnings/precautions.

===History of the black box warnings===

[[Musculoskeletal]] disorders attributed to use of [[quinolone]] antibiotics were first reported in the medical literature in 1972, as an adverse reaction to [[nalidixic acid]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bailey RR, Natale R, Linton AL |title=Nalidixic acid arthralgia |journal=Can Med Assoc J |volume=107 |issue=7 |pages=604 passim |year=1972 |month=October |pmid=4541768 |pmc=1940945}}</ref> [[Rheumatic disease]] after use of a fluoroquinolone ([[norfloxacin]]) was first reported eleven years later.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bailey RR, Kirk JA, Peddie BA |title=Norfloxacin-induced rheumatic disease |journal=N Z Med J |volume=96 |issue=736 |pages=590 |year=1983 |month=July |pmid=6223241}}</ref> In a 1995 letter published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'', representatives of the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) stated that the agency would "update the labeling [package insert] for all marketed fluoroquinolones to include a warning about the possibility of tendon rupture."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Szarfman A, Chen M, Blum MD |title=More on fluoroquinolone antibiotics and tendon rupture |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=332 |issue=3 |pages=193 |year=1995 |month=January |pmid=7800023 |format=letter |doi=10.1056/NEJM199501193320319}}</ref>

Review of the FDA website indicates that the [[Generic drug|generic]] versions of the fluoroquinolones have ''not'' been updated to include this Black Box Warning as of June 2009. And there are numerous reports that this information has not been dessiminated to the pharmacist, the generic products (as well name branded products) continue to contain the previous labels that are absent of this warning, and the Medication Guide has not been made available to the pharmicist or physician for distribution.

Although the FDA had requested that the revised labeling (which included the Black Box Warnings)<ref name="NDA 19-735/S-057"/> accompany the package inserts for any newly shipped products (effecticve January 2009) there are continuing reports that as of September 2009, that the products continue to contain the older labels, and not the revised labels, and are absent of the required medication guides.

==Antibiotic abuse and bacterial resistance==

International Symposium on Antimicrobial Agents and Resistance 2005.</ref>

Years ago the FDA had added warnings regarding the proper use of ofloxacin within the package insert to combat such antibiotic abuse, advising physicians that ofloxacin: "...should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria....".<ref name=ftot/>

Within a recent study concerning the proper use of ofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones in the emergency room it was revealed that 99% of these prescriptions were in error. Out of the one hundred total patients studied, eighty one received a fluoroquinolone for an inappropriate indication. Out of these cases, forty three (53%) were judged to be inappropriate because another agent was considered first line, twenty seven (33%) because there was no evidence of a bacterial infection to begin with (based on the documented evaluation), and eleven (14%) because of the need for such therapy was questionable.

Ofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones had become the most commonly prescribed class of antibiotics to adults in 2002.

==Current litigation==
The manufacturers (Johnson and Johnson/Ortho McNeil) of ofloxacin are currently embroiled in litigation concerning levofloxacin/ofloxacin in regards to spontaneous tendon ruptures. There are a significant number of cases currently pending before the United States District Court, District of Minnesota, involving spontaneous tendon ruptures alleged to be caused by these drugs.  On June 13, 2008 a Judicial Panel On [[Multidistrict Litigation]] (MDL) granted the Plaintiffs’ motion to centralize individual and class action lawsuits involving [[levaquin]] in the District of Minnesota over objection of Defendants, Johnson and Johnson / Ortho McNeil.<ref name="mnd.uscourts.gov"/>
