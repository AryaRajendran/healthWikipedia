'''GMFA''' (originally '''Gay Men Fighting AIDS''') is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[health promotion]]  [[charitable organization]] that campaigns to improve [[gay]] men’s health. Its core interventions tackle issues including [[HIV]], [[AIDS]] and other areas of [[sexual health]].

== History ==
GMFA was founded in 1992 by a group of gay men who felt that there was not enough [[HIV]] prevention work being specifically targeted at gay men.

Originally named Gay Men Fighting AIDS, GMFA’s initial remit was to campaign for more targeted HIV prevention work aimed at gay men, and to raise awareness of HIV amongst gay men.

GMFA uses a model of community mobilisation and peer education, with gay men playing a central role in the design and delivery of interventions. In 2001, GMFA merged with the Black gay men’s group Big Up and, in 2002, GMFA broadened its remit to include all [[Men who have sex with men#Health issues|health issues]] which disproportionately affect gay men over other populations. As a result, the organisation changed its mission statement in 2002 and 'Gay Men Fighting AIDS' became 'GMFA - the gay men's health charity'.

== Mission ==
“Improving gay men’s health by increasing the control they have over their own lives.”

== Principles and values ==
GMFA has 8 principles upon which it is based and claims to be measured:

1. Interventions should be evidence-based.<br />
2. HIV-prevention interventions must contribute towards the targets set out within Making It Count, the planning framework for HIV health promotion recommended by the Department of Health.<br />
3. A project must not promote the health of one person over another.<br />
4. Health promotion should empower people rather than reduce their choices.<br /> 
5. Interventions should be of the greatest value to gay men within the resources available.<br />
6. Services should be provided on an equitable rather than equal basis. Sub-populations of gay men have different levels of need and so our work should attempt to reduce health inequalities amongst gay men.<br />
7. All people, regardless of their HIV status, are entitled to a satisfying sex life.<br />
8. All people, regardless of their sexual behaviour, sexual identity or HIV status, are entitled to the same rights and respect as all other people.

== Volunteer leadership ==
GMFA is a volunteer-led organisation. Volunteers lead the organisation both by being elected members of the Board of Directors and by contributing to projects as members of the groups who develop projects. All GMFA volunteers have the right to join any group within GMFA.

Volunteers are mainly recruited through promotion on all GMFA interventions, and undergo an induction process. The organisation welcomes volunteers from all sections of the community, although the majority of volunteers are gay men. The volunteer base is made up of HIV-negative and HIV-positive people.

== Funding and partnerships ==
GMFA's work is developed in partnership with the [[Elton John AIDS Foundation]], [[Big Lottery]] and other voluntary, statutory and research organisations.

The majority of GMFA's HIV prevention work for gay men in London is funded through the Pan London HIV Prevention Programme, in which its partners are [[Project for Advice, Counselling and Education]], The [[Terrence Higgins Trust]], Camden's Good Sexual Health Team, [[London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard]], the GMI Partnership, Ergo Consulting and commissioners from various London [[NHS primary care trust]]s. 

Through the [[CHAPS (health organisation)|CHAPS]] health organisation, GMFA is also partnered with other sexual health organisations across ten cities in [[England and Wales]]. The CHAPS partnership aims at providing HIV prevention initiatives to reach gay men in those cities across England with the highest prevalence of HIV.

== Interventions ==
GMFA’s interventions for gay men have included advertising campaigns, leaflets, postcards and booklets; FS, its health magazine, distributed nationally in gay venues and GU clinics; and national and London-based courses covering sex education, life skills and smoking cessation. In addition, GMFA creates targeted sexual health interventions for black gay men and HIV positive gay men.

GMFA’s interventions have included: The Arse Class,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rainbownetwork.com/UserPortal/Article/Detail.aspx?ID=26022&sid=85 |title=GaydarRadio &#124; The #1 Gay Dance & Pop Music Radio Station |publisher=Rainbownetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}</ref> a group-work course, which teaches gay men how to keep sex fun, safer and pleasurable. The first course ran in cities across the UK in 2007; Its Responsibility advertising campaign in 2005, encouraging men to take responsibility for safer sex; FS magazine, (Fit and Sexy) which is available for free in gay venues, as a download and in GUM clinics across the UK; and In The Family, a 2-volume celebration of the achievements of men and women who have helped to build the Black gay community in London.

In November 2010 the "Count me in" campaign to stop the spread of HIV was launched as that year's campaign for [[UNAIDS]]'s [[World AIDS day]].<ref>{{cite web|author=James Sanders |url=http://news.pinkpaper.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=4266 |title=Community pledge to support GMFA campaign - PinkPaper.com |publisher=News.pinkpaper.com |date=2010-11-12 |accessdate=2012-02-10|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110716164443/http://news.pinkpaper.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=4266|archivedate=2011-07-11}}</ref> The campaign was endorsed by the Lib-Con Minister for Equality Lynne Featherstone, via a Home Office video<ref>{{cite web|author=ukhomeoffice |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZceOiQID0s |title=World Aids Day 2010 |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-12-01 |accessdate=2012-02-10}}</ref> and a transcript and related statement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/media-centre/video-transcripts/world-aids-day/?view=Standard&pubID=846368 |title=World Aids Day 2010 |publisher=Home Office |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}</ref>
