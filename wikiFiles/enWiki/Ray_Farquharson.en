'''Ray Fletcher Farquharson''' [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (4 August 1897 – 1 June 1965) was a Canadian doctor, university professor, and medical researcher. Born in [[Claude, Ontario]], he attended and taught at the [[University of Toronto]] for most of his life, and was trained and employed at [[Toronto General Hospital]]. With co-researcher [[Arthur Squires]], Farquharson was responsible for the discovery of the Farquharson phenomenon, an important principle of [[endocrinology]].

He served in the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s, earning appointment as a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] for his medical work during the latter. He chaired the Penicillin Committee of Canada and served as a medical consultant for the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]. He was awarded the Queen's Coronation Medal in 1953 for his work for the Defence Review Board. Farquharson was also a charter member of the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]].

Farquharson was heavily involved in Canadian medical research and education. As a member of the [[National Research Council of Canada]], his "Farquharson Report" led to the establishment of the [[Medical Research Council of Canada]], of which he was the first president. He received numerous honorary degrees from Canadian universities, and served on the first Board of Governors of [[York University]]. He died in 1965, leaving a wife and two daughters. Farquharson was posthumously inducted into the [[Canadian Medical Hall of Fame]] in 1998.
