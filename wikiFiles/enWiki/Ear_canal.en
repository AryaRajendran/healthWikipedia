The '''ear canal''' ('''external auditory meatus''', '''external acoustic meatus''', '''EAM''') ({{lang-la|meatus acusticus externus}}), is a tube running from the [[outer ear]] to the [[middle ear]]. The adult human ear canal extends from the [[pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] to the [[eardrum]] and is about {{convert|2.5|cm|0}} in length and {{convert|0.7|cm|1}} in diameter.

== Structure==
The human ear canal is divided into two parts. The elastic cartilage part forms the outer third of the canal, Its anterior and lower wall are cartilaginous, whereas its superior and back wall are fibrous. The cartilage is the continuation of the cartilage framework of pinna. The bony part forms the inner two thirds. The bony part is much shorter in children and is only a ring (''annulus tympanicus'') in the newborn.

Size and shape of the canal vary among individuals. The canal is approximately {{convert|2.5|cm|0}} long and {{convert|0.7|cm}} in diameter.<ref>Faddis, B. T. (2008). "Structural and functional anatomy of the outer and middle ear". In W. Clark & K. Ohlemiller (Eds.), ''Anatomy and physiology of hearing for audiologists'' (pp. 93â€“108). Thomson Delmar Learning.</ref> It has a [[wikt:sigmoid|sigmoid form]] and runs from behind and above downward and forward. On the cross-section, it is of oval shape. These are important factors to consider when fitting [[earplug]]s.

==Disorders==
Due to its relative exposure to the outside world, the ear canal is susceptible to diseases and other disorders. Some disorders include:
* [[Atresia]] of the ear canal
* Bone exposure, caused by the wearing away of skin in the canal
*[[Cholesteatoma]]
* [[Contact dermatitis]] of the ear canal
* Ear fungus
*[[Ear mite]]s in animals
* Ear [[myiasis]], an extremely rare infestation of maggots
*Foreign body in ear
*[[Granuloma]], a [[scar]] usually caused by [[tympanostomy tube]]s
* [[Otitis externa]] (swimmer's ear), bacteria-caused inflammation of the ear canal
*[[Stenosis]], a gradual closing of the canal

==Earwax==
{{Main|Earwax}}
Earwax, also known as cerumen, is a yellowish, waxy substance secreted in the ear canals. It plays an important role in the human ear canal, assisting in cleaning and lubrication, and also provides some protection from [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]], and [[insect]]s. Excess or impacted cerumen can press against the eardrum and/or occlude the external auditory canal and impair hearing.
