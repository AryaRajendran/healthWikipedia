==Therapeutic uses==
In modern [[medicine]], theobromine is used as a [[vasodilator]] (a blood vessel widener), a [[diuretic]] (urination aid), and [[myocardium|heart]] [[stimulant]].<ref name="dictbiochem1943">{{cite book | title=Dictionary of Bio-Chemistry and Related Subjects | author=William Marias Malisoff | year=1943 | publisher=Philosophical Library | pages=311, 530, 573 | isbn = B0006AQ0NU}}</ref> 

Theobromine increases urine production. Because of this [[diuretic]] effect, and its ability to dilate blood vessels, theobromine has been used to treat high blood pressure.<ref name="chemistry.about.com">http://chemistry.about.com/od/factsstructures/a/theobromine-chemistry.htm</ref>  ''The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition'' notes that historic use of theobromine as a treatment for other circulatory problems including [[arteriosclerosis]], certain [[vascular disease]]s, [[angina pectoris]], and [[hypertension]] should be considered in future studies.<ref name="AJCN">{{cite journal | title=Effects of theobromine should be considered in future studies | last=Kelly | first=Caleb J | year=2005 | month=August | journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=82 |issue=2 | pages=486–7; author reply 487–8 | pmid=16087999}}</ref>

Following its discovery in the late 19th century, theobromine was put to use by 1916, when it was recommended by the publication ''Principles of Medical Treatment'' as a treatment for [[edema]] (excessive liquid in parts of the body), [[syphilis|syphilitic]] [[angina pectoris|angina]] attacks, and degenerative angina.<ref name="princimedtreat-1916">{{cite book | title=Principles of medical treatment | author=George Cheever Shattuck | pages=15, 39, 41 | year=1916 | publisher=W.M. Leonard }}</ref> 

In the human body, theobromine levels are halved between 6–10 hours after consumption.<ref name="chemistry.about.com"/>

Theobromine has also been used in [[teratology|birth defect]] experiments involving [[mouse|mice]] and [[rabbit]]s. A decreased [[fetus|fetal]] weight was noted in rabbits following [[forced feeding]], but not after other administration of theobromine. Birth defects were not seen in rats.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Rambali B, Andel I van, Schenk E, Wolterink G, Werken G van de, Stevenson H, Vleeming W | title=[The contribution of cocoa additive to cigarette smoking addiction] | journal=RIVM  | year=2002 | url=http://rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/650270002.pdf | format=PDF |issue=report 650270002/2002}}- The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Netherlands)</ref>  Possible future uses of theobromine in such fields as [[cancer]] prevention have been patented.<ref>{{Ref patent | number=6693104 | title=Theobromine with an anti-carcinogenic activity | gdate=2004-02-17 | country=US }}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Even without dietary intake, theobromine may occur in the body as it is a product of the human metabolism of [[caffeine]], which is [[metabolism|metabolised]] in the liver into 10% theobromine, 4% [[theophylline]], and 80% [[paraxanthine]].<ref name="pharmgkb">{{cite web | title = Caffeine | publisher = The Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base | url = http://www.pharmgkb.org/do/serve?objId=PA448710&objCls=Drug#tabview=tab1 | accessdate = 2011-01-08 }}</ref>

In the liver, theobromine is metabolized into [[xanthine]] and subsequently into [[methyluric acid]].<ref>{{Cite journal | title=A Study of the Metabolism of Theobromine, Theophylline, and Caffeine in Man | author=Herbert H.

As a [[phosphodiesterase inhibitor]], theobromine helps prevent the [[phosphodiesterase]] enzymes from converting the active cAMP to an inactive form.<ref name="omd-pdaseinhibitor">* {{cite web | url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?phosphodiesterase | title=Phosphodiesterase | publisher=On-Line Medical Dictionary | accessdate=2007-02-23 }}<br/> {{cite web | url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?inhibitors | title=Inhibitor | publisher=On-Line Medical Dictionary | accessdate=2007-02-23 }}</ref>  cAMP  works as a [[second messenger]] in many [[hormone]]- and [[neurotransmitter]]-controlled metabolic systems, such as the breakdown of [[glycogen]].  When the inactivation of cAMP is inhibited by a compound such as theobromine, the effects of the neurotransmitter or hormone that stimulated the production of cAMP are much longer-lived.  In general, the net result is a stimulatory effect.<ref name="lehningerbiochem">{{cite book | title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry | author=David L. Nelson, Michael M.

==Effects==
===Humans===
[[Image:Gray961.png|thumb|right|A diagram of the bronchus. The loosening of the muscles in the bronchus caused by theobromine helps alleviate the symptoms of asthma.]]
The amount of theobromine found in chocolate is small enough that chocolate can, in general, be safely consumed by humans. However, [[theobromine poisoning]] may result from the chronic or acute consumption of large quantities, especially in the elderly.<ref>[http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/f?./temp/~XkmeXY:1  See: THEOBROMINE, CASRN: 83-67-0] in the [[Hazardous Substances Data Bank]]</ref>

While theobromine and caffeine are similar in that they are related alkaloids, theobromine is weaker in both its inhibition of [[cyclic nucleotide]] [[phosphodiesterases]] and its [[Receptor antagonist|antagonism]] of [[adenosine receptors]].<ref name="therapeutics">{{cite book | editor=Joel Hardman & Lee Limbird | title=Goodman & Gilman's the pharmacological basis of therapeutics, 10th ed. | publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=New York | year=2001 | page=745 | isbn=0-07-135469-7}}</ref>  Therefore, theobromine has a lesser impact on the human [[central nervous system]] than caffeine.

As it is a myocardial stimulant as well as a vasodilator, it increases heartbeat, yet it also dilates blood vessels, causing a reduced [[blood pressure]].<ref name="arecapatent">{{Ref patent | country=US | number=20050089584 | title=Methods and compositions for oral delivery of Areca and mate' or theobromine | gdate=2005-04-28 }}</ref> However, a 2005 paper published suggested that the decrease in blood pressure may be caused by [[flavanols]].<ref name="AJCN"/> Furthermore, its draining effect allows it to be used to treat [[cardiac failure]], which leads to and is exacerbated by an excessive accumulation of fluid in the body.<ref name="arecapatent"/>

A 2004 study published by [[Imperial College London]] concluded that theobromine has an [[cough medicine|antitussive]] (cough-reducing) effect superior to [[codeine]] by suppressing [[vagus nerve]] activity.<ref name=PMID_15548587>{{cite journal | author = Usmani, Omar S.; Belvisi, Maria G.; Patel, Hema J.; Crispino, Natascia; Birrell Mark A.; Korbonits, Márta; Korbonits, Dezső; Barnes, Peter J. | title = Theobromine inhibits sensory nerve activation and cough | journal = [[Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology|FASEB]] Journal | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 231–3 | pmid = 15548587 | url = http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/reprint/04-1990fjev1 | doi = 10.1096/fj.04-1990fje | accessdate = 2008-07-04 | date = November 17, 2004 | quote = The present study demonstrates that theobromine, a methylxanthine derivative present in cocoa, effectively inhibits [[citric acid]]-induced cough in [[guinea pig|guinea-pigs]] [[in vivo]].

A study conducted in Utah between 1983 and 1986, and published in 1993, showed a possible association between theobromine and an increased risk of suffering from [[prostate cancer]] in older men.<ref name=PMID_8280834>{{cite journal | author = Slattery, Martha L.; West, Dee W. | title = Smoking, alcohol, coffee, tea, caffeine, and theobromine: risk of prostate cancer in Utah (United States) | journal = Cancer Causes Control | volume = 4 | issue = 6 | pages = 559–63 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8280834 | quote = Compared with men with very low levels of theobromine intake, older men consuming 11 to 20 and over 20 mg of theobromine per day were at increased risk of prostate cancer (odds ratio-[OR] for all tumors = 2.06, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.33-3.20, and OR = 1.47, CI = 0.99-2.19, respectively; OR for aggressive tumors -- 1.90, CI = 0.90-3.97, and OR -- 1.74, CI -- 0.91-3.32, respectively) | doi = 10.1007/BF00052432}}</ref> This association was not found to be linear for aggressive tumors.<ref name=PMID_8280834/> While the association may be spurious, it is plausible.<ref name=PMID_8280834/>  Prenatal and infant exposure to theobromine appeared possibly associated with [[hypospadias]] and testicular cancer in one population study.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 19440400 | doi=10.3390/ijerph6020578 | volume=6 | issue=2 | title=Correlation analysis of cocoa consumption data with worldwide incidence rates of testicular cancer and hypospadias | pmc=2672359 | year=2009 | month=February | author=Giannandrea F | journal=Int J Environ Res Public Health | pages=568–78}}</ref>

As with caffeine, theobromine can cause sleeplessness, tremors, restlessness, anxiety, as well as contribute to [[Polyuria|increased production of urine]].<ref name="asthma"/> Additional side effects include [[anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]], [[nausea]], and [[vomiting]].<ref name="biam">{{cite web | url=http://www.biam2.org/www1/Sub1331.html | title=Theobromine | publisher=BIAM | language=French | date=2000-03-29 | accessdate=2007-06-10 }}</ref>

===Animals===

Animals that [[metabolize]] theobromine (found in chocolate) more slowly, such as dogs, can succumb to [[theobromine poisoning]] from as little as {{convert|50|g|oz}} of general chocolate{{Clarify|date=February 2013}} for a smaller dog and {{convert|400|g|oz}}, or around nine 1.55 oz small [[Hershey bars]], for an average-sized dog. 

The same risk is reported for cats as well, although cats are less likely to ingest sweet food, having no [[Sweetness#The sweetness receptor|sweet taste receptors]].<ref>{{cite web |first=David |last=Biello |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=strange-but-true-cats-cannot-taste-sweets |title=Strange but True: Cats Cannot Taste Sweets |publisher=Scientific American |date=August 16, 2007 |accessdate=July 28, 2009}}</ref> Complications include digestive issues, dehydration, excitability, and a slow heart rate. Later stages of theobromine poisoning include [[epilepsy|epileptic]]-like [[seizure]]s and death. If caught early on, theobromine poisoning is treatable.<ref name="healthwatchcanines">{{Cite news | title=HEALTH WATCH: How to Avoid a Canine Chocolate Catastrophe! | newspaper=The News Letter | location=Belfast, Northern Ireland | date=2005-03-01}}</ref> Although not usual, the effects of theobromine poisoning, as stated, can become fatal.

The toxicity for birds is not known, but it is typically assumed that it is toxic to birds.<ref>B. Harvey, [http://www.oldworldaviaries.com/text/miscellaneous/toxicoses.html Toxicoses in Birds].</ref>

===Other===
Theobromine is known to induce [[gene]] [[mutation]]s in lower [[eukaryote]]s and [[bacteria]]. At the time of a 1991 report, further updated in 1997, by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]], genetic mutations had been found in higher eukaryotic cells, specifically cultured [[mammalian]] cells, but the compound was still listed as having inadequate evidence for classification of human carcinogenicity.<ref>{{cite web | author=International Agency for Research on Cancer | title=Volume 51: Coffee, Tea, Mate, Methylxanthines and Methylglyoxal - Theobromine | url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol51/volume51.pdf | format=PDF | work=IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans | publisher=[[World Health Organization|WHO]] | date=November 17, 1991 | accessdate=2006-09-19 | authorlink=International Agency for Research on Cancer}}</ref>
