'''Personality pathology''' refers to enduring patterns of cognition, emotion, and behavior that negatively affect a person's adaptation. In [[psychiatry]] and [[clinical psychology]], it is characterized by adaptive inflexibility, vicious cycles of maladaptive behavior, and emotional instability under stress. In the United States and elsewhere, [[personality disorders]] are diagnosed categorically on [[Axis II (psychology)|Axis II]] of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]].
