<!--DEFINITION-->
'''Facial trauma''', also called '''maxillofacial trauma''', is any [[physical trauma]] to the [[face]].  <!--While the term ''trauma'' technically refers to any injury no matter how mild, it is usually reserved in this context for more serious injury.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} --> Facial trauma can involve [[soft tissue injury|soft tissue injuries]] such as [[burn]]s, [[laceration]]s and [[bruises]], or [[bone fracture|fracture]]s of the [[facial bone]]s such as [[nasal fracture]]s and fractures of the jaw, as well as trauma such as [[eye injury|eye injuries]].  Symptoms are specific to the type of injury; for example, fractures may involve pain, swelling, loss of function, or changes in the shape of facial structures. 

<!-- RX PROGNOSIS COMPLICATIONS-->
Facial injuries have the potential to cause disfigurement and loss of function; for example, blindness or difficulty moving the jaw can result.  Although it is seldom life-threatening, facial trauma can also be deadly, because it can cause severe bleeding or interference with the [[airway]]; thus a primary concern in treatment is ensuring that the airway is open and not threatened so that the patient can breathe.  Depending on the type of facial injury, treatment may include bandaging and suturing of open [[wound]]s, administration of ice, [[antibiotic]]s and [[analgesic|pain killers]], moving bones back into place, and surgery.  When fractures are suspected, [[radiography]] is used for diagnosis. Treatment may also be necessary for other injuries such as [[traumatic brain injury]], which commonly accompany severe facial trauma. 

<!--EPIDEMIOLOGY, CAUSES, PREVENTION-->
In developed countries, the leading cause of facial trauma used to be [[motor vehicle accidents]], but this mechanism has been replaced by interpersonal violence; however auto accidents still predominate as the cause in developing countries and are still a major cause elsewhere. Thus prevention efforts include awareness campaigns to educate the public about safety measures such as [[seat belt]]s and [[motorcycle helmet]]s, and laws to prevent [[driving under the influence|drunk and unsafe driving]].  Other causes of facial trauma include falls, industrial accidents, and sports injuries.

Soft tissue injuries include [[abrasion (medical)|abrasions]], [[laceration]]s, [[avulsion]]s, [[contusion|bruises]], burns and [[cold injury|cold injuries]].<ref name="Jordan06"/>

[[File:Human skull front bones.svg|left|thumb|The facial bones]]
Commonly injured facial bones include the [[nasal bone]] (the nose), the [[maxilla]] (the bone that forms the upper jaw), and the [[human mandible|mandible]] (the lower jaw). The mandible may be fractured at its symphysis, body, angle, ramus, and condoyle.<ref name="Neuman06"/>  The [[zygoma]] (cheekbone) and the [[frontal bone]] (forehead) are other sites for fractures.<ref name="Neuman06b">[[#Neuman06b|Neuman MI, Eriksson E (2006)]]. pp. 1480–81.</ref>  Fractures may also occur in the bones of the palate and those that come together to form the orbit of the eye. 

At the beginning of the 20th&nbsp;century, [[René Le Fort]] mapped typical locations for facial fractures; these are now known as [[LeFort fracture|Le Fort I, II, and III fractures]] (right).<ref name="Allsop02"/> Le Fort I fractures, also called Guérin or horizontal maxillary fractures,<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/10084701|Le Fort I fracture}}.</ref> involve the maxilla, separating it from the palate.<ref name="Shah06"/>  Le Fort II fractures, also called pyramidal fractures of the maxilla,<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/10084713|Le Fort II fracture}}.</ref> cross the nasal bones and the orbital rim.<ref name="Shah06"/>  Le Fort III fractures, also called craniofacial disjunction and transverse facial fractures,<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/10084721|Le Fort III fracture}}.</ref> cross the front of the maxilla and involve the [[lacrimal bone]], the [[lamina papyracea]], and the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbital floor]], and often involve the [[ethmoid bone]].<ref name="Shah06"/> are the most serious.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|four/000042514|Le Fort fracture}}.</ref>  Le Fort fractures, which account for 10–20% of facial fractures, are often associated with other serious injuries.<ref name="Shah06"/>  Le Fort made his classifications based on work with cadaver skulls, and the classification system has been criticized as imprecise and simplistic since most midface fractures involve a combination of Le Fort fractures.<ref name="Shah06">{{cite web|author=Shah AR, Valvassori GE, Roure RM |title=Le Fort Fractures|url=http://www.emedicine.com/radio/TOPIC385.HTM|date=2006 |publisher=EMedicine}}</ref>  Although most facial fractures do not follow the patterns described by Le Fort precisely, the system is still used to categorize injuries.<ref name="Moore035"/>

==Causes==
Injury mechanisms such as falls, assaults, [[sports injury|sports injuries]], and vehicle crashes are common causes of facial trauma in children<ref name="Neuman06">[[#Neuman06b|Neuman MI, Eriksson E (2006)]]. pp. 1475–77.</ref> as well as adults.<ref name="Allsop02">{{cite book |author=Allsop D, Kennett K|editor=Nahum AM, Melvin J |chapter=Skull and facial bone trauma| title=Accidental injury: Biomechanics and prevention |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2002 |pages=254–258 |isbn=0-387-98820-3 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Y4l5fopEI0EC&pg=PA254&dq=facial+trauma |accessdate=2008-10-08}}</ref> Blunt assaults, blows from fists or objects, are a common cause of facial injury.<ref name="Shapiro01"/><ref name="Moore032">[[#CITEREFMoore032|Seyfer AE, Hansen JE (2003)]]. pp. 423–24.</ref>  Facial trauma can also result from wartime injuries such as [[Gunshot wounds|gunshots]] and [[blast injury|blasts]].
Animal attacks and work-related injuries such as industrial accidents are other causes.<ref name="Adeyemo05"/>  Vehicular trauma is one of the leading causes of facial injuries.  Trauma commonly occurs when the face strikes a part of the vehicle's interior, such as the steering wheel.<ref name="Moore03">

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Black eye 2.jpg|right|thumb|Bruising, a common symptom in facial trauma]]
Fractures of facial bones, like other fractures, may be associated with pain, bruising, and swelling of the surrounding tissues (such symptoms can occur in the absence of fractures as well).  Fractures of the nose, [[base of the skull]], or maxilla may be associated with profuse [[Epistaxis|nosebleed]]s.<ref name="Moore032"/> Nasal fractures may be associated with deformity of the nose, as well as swelling and bruising.<ref name="Storrow02"/>  Deformity in the face, for example a sunken cheekbone or teeth which do not align properly, suggests the presence of fractures. Asymmetry can suggest facial fractures or damage to nerves.<ref name="Jordan06"/> People with mandibular fractures often have pain and difficulty opening their mouths and may have numbness in the lip and chin.<ref name="Neuman06"/> With Le Fort fractures, the midface may move relative to the rest of the face or skull.<ref name="Moore035">[[#CITEREFMoore032|Kellman RM.]]  Commentary on Seyfer AE, Hansen JE (2003). p. 442.</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[Radiography]], imaging of tissues using [[X-ray]]s, is used to rule out facial fractures.<ref name="Storrow02">{{cite book |author=Munter DW, McGurk TD | editor = Knoop KJ, Stack LB, Storrow AB |chapter=Head and facial trauma|title=Atlas of emergency medicine |publisher=McGraw-Hill, Medical Publishing Division |location=New York |year=2002 |pages=9–10 |isbn=0-07-135294-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  [[Angiography]] (X-rays taken of the inside of blood vessels) can be used to locate the source of bleeding.<ref name="Thaller04b"/>  However the complex bones and tissues of the face can make it difficult to interpret plain radiographs; [[Computed tomography|CT scan]]ning is better for detecting fractures and examining soft tissues, and is often needed to determine whether surgery is necessary, but it is more expensive and difficult to obtain.<ref name="Neuman06"/>  CT scanning is usually considered to be more definitive and better at detecting facial injuries than X-ray.<ref name="Jordan06"/> CT scanning is especially likely to be used in people with multiple injuries who need CT scans to assess for other injuries anyway.<ref name="Perry08p1"/> 

==Prevention==
Measures to reduce facial trauma include laws enforcing seat belt use and public education to increase awareness about the importance of seat belts<ref name="Shapiro01"/> and motorcycle helmets.<ref name="Adeyemo05"/>  Efforts to reduce drunk driving are other preventative measures; changes to laws and their enforcement have been proposed, as well as changes to societal attitudes toward the activity.<ref name="Shapiro01"/> Information obtained from [[biomechanics]] studies can be used to design automobiles with a view toward preventing facial injuries.<ref name="Allsop02"/>  While seat belts reduce the number and severity of facial injuries that occur in crashes,<ref name="Shapiro01"/> airbags alone are not very effective at preventing the injuries.<ref name="Jordan06"/> In sports, safety devices including helmets have been found to reduce the risk of severe facial injury.<ref name="McIntosh05">{{cite journal |author=McIntosh AS, McCrory P |title=Preventing head and neck injury |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine (Free registration required) |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=314–18 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15911597 |pmc=1725244 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2005.018200 |url=http://bjsm.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/39/6/314}}</ref>  Additional attachments such as face guards may be added to sports helmets to prevent orofacial injury (injury to the mouth or face).<ref name="McIntosh05"/> mouth guards also used,

==Treatment==
<!--AIRWAY-->
An immediate need in treatment is to ensure that the airway is open and not threatened (for example by tissues or foreign objects), because airway compromisation can occur rapidly and insidiously, and is potentially deadly.<ref name="Thaller04">[[#Jeroukhimov|Jeroukhimov I, Cockburn M, Cohn S (2004)]]. pp.2–3.</ref>  Material in the mouth that threatens the airway can be removed manually or using a suction tool for that purpose, and supplemental oxygen can be provided.<ref name="Thaller04"/> Facial fractures that threaten to interfere with the airway can be reduced by moving the bones back into place; this both reduces bleeding and moves the bone out of the way of the airway. [[Tracheal intubation]] (inserting a tube into the airway to assist breathing) may be difficult or impossible due to swelling.<ref name="Moore032"/>  Nasal intubation, inserting an [[endotracheal tube]] through the nose, may be [[contraindication|contraindicated]] in the presence of facial trauma because if there is an undiscovered fracture at the base of the skull, the tube could be forced through it and into the brain.<ref name="Moore032"/>  If facial injuries prevent oraotracheal or nasotracheal intubation, a [[Cricothyrotomy|surgical airway]] can be placed to provide an adequate airway.<ref name="Moore032"/>  Although [[cricothyrotomy]] and [[tracheostomy]] can secure an airway when other methods fail, they are used only as a last resort because of potential complications and the difficulty of the procedures.<ref name="Neuman06"/>

[[File:Hämatom und Naht.jpg|left|thumb|Sutures may be used to close wounds.]]
<!--BLEEDING-->
A dressing can be placed over wounds to keep them clean and to facilitate healing, and [[antibiotic]]s may be used in cases where infection is likely.<ref name="Neuman06b"/> People with contaminated wounds who have not been immunized against [[tetanus]] within five years may be given a tetanus vaccination.<ref name="Jordan06"/> Lacerations may require [[surgical suture|stitches]] to stop bleeding and facilitate [[wound healing]] with as little [[scarring]] as possible.<ref name="Neuman06"/> Although it is not common for bleeding from the maxillofacial region to be profuse enough to be life threatening, it is still necessary to control such bleeding.<ref name="Perry08p3">{{cite journal |author=Perry M, O'Hare J, Porter G |title=Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) and facial trauma: Can one size fit all? Part 3: Hypovolaemia and facial injuries in the multiply injured patient |journal=International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=405–14 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18262768 |doi=10.1016/j.ijom.2007.11.005 |url=}}</ref>  Severe bleeding occurs as the result of facial trauma in 1–11% of patients, and the origin of this bleeding can be difficult to locate.<ref name="Thaller04b">[[#Jeroukhimov|Jeroukhimov I, Cockburn M, Cohn S (2004)]]. pp.10–11.</ref> Nasal packing can be used to control [[epistaxis|nose bleed]]s and [[hematoma]]s that may form on the [[septum]] between the nostrils.<ref name="Storrow02"/>  Such hematomas need to be drained.<ref name="Storrow02"/>  Mild nasal fractures need nothing more than ice and [[analgesic|pain killers]], while breaks with severe deformities or associated lacerations may need further treatment, such as moving the bones back into alignment and antibiotic treatment.<ref name="Storrow02"/>

<!--COSMETIC-->
Treatment aims to repair the face's natural bony architecture and to leave as little apparent trace of the injury as possible.<ref name="Moore032"/> Fractures may be repaired with metal plates and screws.<ref name="Moore032"/>  They may also be wired into place.  [[Bone grafting]] is another option to repair the bone's architecture, to fill out missing sections, and to provide structural support.<ref name="Moore032"/>  Medical literature suggests that early repair of facial injuries, within hours or days, results in better outcomes for function and appearance.<ref name="Perry08p1"/> 

Surgical specialists who commonly treat specific aspects of facial trauma are [[oral and maxillofacial surgery|oral and maxillofacial surgeons]].<ref name="Neuman06"/>  These surgeons are trained in the comprehensive management of trauma to the lower, middle and upper face and have to take written and oral board examinations covering the management of facial injuries.

==Prognosis and complications==
<!--LIFE THREATS AND AIRWAY-->
By itself, facial trauma rarely presents a threat to life; however it is often associated with dangerous injuries, and life-threatening complications such as blockage of the airway may occur.<ref name="Neuman06"/>
The airway can be blocked due to bleeding, swelling of surrounding tissues, or damage to structures.<ref name="Moore031">

<!--DISABILITY-->
Even when facial injuries are not life threatening, they have the potential to cause disfigurement and disability, with long-term physical and emotional results.<ref name="Allsop02"/>  Facial injuries can cause problems with eye, nose, or jaw function<ref name="Moore032"/> and can threaten eyesight.<ref name="Perry08p1">{{cite journal |author=Perry M |title=Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) and facial trauma: can one size fit all?

<!--problems with bone growth-->
Nerves and muscles may be trapped by broken bones; in these cases the bones need to be put back into their proper places quickly.<ref name="Neuman06"/>  For example, fractures of the orbital floor or medial orbital wall of the eye can entrap the [[medial rectus]] or [[inferior rectus muscle]]s.<ref name="Moore033">[[#CITEREFMoore032|Seyfer AE, Hansen JE (2003)]]. p. 434.</ref>  In facial wounds, [[tear duct]]s and nerves of the face may be damaged.<ref name="Jordan06"/>  Fractures of the frontal bone can interfere with the drainage of the [[frontal sinus]] and can cause [[sinusitis]].<ref name="Moore034">[[#CITEREFMoore032|Seyfer AE, Hansen JE (2003)]]. p. 437.</ref>  

Infection is another potential complication, for example when debris is ground into an abrasion and remains there.<ref name="Neuman06"/> Injuries resulting from bites carry a high infection risk.<ref name="Jordan06"/>

==Epidemiology==

As many as 50–70% of people who survive traffic accidents have facial trauma.<ref name="Jordan06">{{cite book |author=Jordan JR, Calhoun KH |editor=Bailey BJ, Johnson JT, Newlands SD, ''et al.''. |chapter=Management of soft tissue trauma and auricular trauma|title=Head & Neck Surgery: Otolaryngology |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2006 |pages=935–36 |isbn=0-7817-5561-1 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=u5o3illp9CUC&pg=RA1-PA935&dq=facial+trauma |accessdate=2008-10-19}}</ref> In most developed countries, violence from other people has replaced vehicle collisions as the main cause of maxillofacial trauma; however in many developing countries traffic accidents remain the major cause.<ref name="Adeyemo05">{{cite journal |author=Adeyemo WL, Ladeinde AL, Ogunlewe MO, James O |title=Trends and characteristics of oral and maxillofacial injuries in Nigeria: A review of the literature |journal=Head & Face Medicine |volume=1 |issue= 1|pages=7 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16270942 |pmc=1277015 |doi=10.1186/1746-160X-1-7 |url=http://www.head-face-med.com/content/1/1/7}}</ref>  Increased use of [[seat belt]]s and [[airbag]]s has been credited with a reduction in the incidence of maxillofacial trauma, but fractures of the [[human mandible|mandible]] (the jawbone) are not decreased by these protective measures.<ref name="Moore03"/> The risk of maxillofacial trauma is decreased by a factor of two with use of motorcycle helmets.<ref name="Moore03"/> A decline in facial bone fractures due to vehicle accidents is thought to be due to seat belt and drunk driving laws, strictly enforced speed limits and use of airbags.<ref name="Shapiro01">{{cite journal |author=Shapiro AJ, Johnson RM, Miller SF, McCarthy MC |title=Facial fractures in a level I trauma centre: the importance of protective devices and alcohol abuse |journal=Injury |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=353–56 |year=2001 |month=June |pmid=11382418 |doi= 10.1016/S0020-1383(00)00245-X|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002013830000245X}}</ref> In vehicle accidents, drivers and front seat passengers are at highest risk for facial trauma.<ref name="Moore03"/> 

<!--DEMOGRAPHICS-->
Facial fractures are distributed in a fairly [[normal curve]] by age, with a peak incidence occurring between ages 20 and 40, and children under 12 suffering only 5–10% of all facial fractures.<ref name="Neuman06q">[[#Neuman06b|Neuman MI, Eriksson E (2006)]]. p. 1475. "The age distribution of facial fractures follows a relatively normal curve, with a peak incidence between 20 and 40 years of age."</ref> Most facial trauma in children involves lacerations and soft tissue injuries.<ref name="Neuman06"/> There are several reasons for the lower incidence of facial fractures in children: the face is smaller in relation to the rest of the head, children are less often in some situations associated with facial fractures such as occupational and motor vehicle hazards, there is a lower proportion of [[cortical bone]] to [[cancellous bone]] in children's faces, poorly developed [[sinus (anatomy)|sinus]]es make the bones stronger, and fat pads provide protection for the facial bones.<ref name="Neuman06"/>

<!--ASSOCIATED INJURIES-->
[[head injury|Head]] and [[traumatic brain injury|brain injuries]] are commonly associated with facial trauma, particularly that of the upper face; brain injury occurs in 15–48% of people with maxillofacial trauma.<ref name="Thaller04c"> [[#Jeroukhimov|Jeroukhimov I, Cockburn M, Cohn S (2004)]]. p. 11. "The incidence of brain injury in patients with maxillofacial trauma varies from 15 to 48%.  The risk of serious brain injury is particularly high with upper facial injury."</ref> Coexisting injuries can affect treatment of facial trauma; for example they  may be emergent and need to be treated before facial injuries.<ref name="Perry08p1"/> People with trauma above the level of the [[clavicle|collar bone]]s are considered to be at high risk for [[cervical spine]] injuries (spinal injuries in the neck) and special precautions must be taken to avoid movement of the spine, which could worsen a spinal injury.<ref name="Perry08p2"/>
