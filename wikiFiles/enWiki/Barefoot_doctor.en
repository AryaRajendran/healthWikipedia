'''Barefoot doctors''' ({{zh|s=赤脚医生|p=chìjiǎo yīshēng}}) are farmers who received minimal basic medical and [[paramedic]]al training and worked in rural villages in the [[People's Republic of China]].  Their purpose was to bring health care to rural areas where urban-trained doctors would not settle. They promoted basic [[hygiene]], [[preventive health care]], and [[family planning]] and treated common [[illness]]es. The name comes from southern farmers, who would often work barefoot in the rice paddies. 

In the 1930s, the [[Rural Reconstruction Movement]] had pioneered village health workers trained in basic health as part of a coordinated system, and there had been provincial experiments after 1949, but after Mao Zedong's healthcare speech in 1965 the concept was developed and institutionalized. In his speech, [[Mao Zedong]] criticized the urban bias of the medical system of the time, and called for a system with greater focus on the well being of the rural population.<ref name="zhang">{{cite journal

China's health policy changed quickly after this speech and in 1968, the barefoot doctors program became integrated into national policy.<ref name="zhang" />  These programs were called "rural cooperative medical systems" (RCMS) and strove to include community participation with the rural provision of health services.<ref name="carrin">{{cite journal

Barefoot doctors became a part of the [[Cultural Revolution]], which also radically diminished the influence of the [[Weishengbu]], China's health ministry, which was dominated by Western-trained doctors.

==Training==
The barefoot doctors usually graduated from secondary school and then received about six months of training at a county or community hospital,<ref name="zhang" /> though training length varied from a few months to one and a half years. Training was focused on epidemic disease prevention,<ref name="mcconnell">

curing simple ailments that were common in the specific area, and were trained to use Western medicines and techniques.<ref name="zhang" /> An important part of the Cultural Revolution was the movement of sending intellectuals, and in this case doctors, to serve in the countryside (Chinese: 下鄉 [[pinyin]]:xìa xiāng). They would live in an area for half a year to a year and continue the education of the barefoot doctors. About a fifth of the barefoot doctors later entered [[medical school]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==Work==
Barefoot doctors acted as a primary health-care provider at the grass-roots level. They were given a set of medicines, both Western and Chinese, that they would dispense. Often they grew their own herbs in the backyard. As Mao had called for, they tried to integrate both Western and Chinese medicine, like [[acupuncture]] and [[moxibustion]]. An important feature was that they were still involved in farm work, often spending as much as 50% of their time on this - this meant that the rural farmers perceived them as peers and respected their advice more.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} They were integrated into a system where they could refer seriously ill people to township and county hospitals. 

Barefoot doctors provided mostly primary health care services, and focused on prevention rather than treatment.<ref name="zhang" /> They provided immunizations, delivery for pregnant women, and improvement of sanitation.<ref name="zhang" /> The income of the barefoot doctors was calculated as if it were agricultural work; they were paid roughly half of what a classically trained doctor made.<ref name="zhang" /> This funding came from collective welfare funds as well as from local farmer contributions (from 0.5% to 2% of their annual incomes).<ref name="carrin" /> This program was successful in part because the doctors were selected and paid by their own villages. By the 1960s, there were RCMS programs in 90% of China's rural villages.<ref name="zhang" /> 

The work of the barefoot doctors effectively reduced health care costs in the People’s Republic of China, and provided primary care treatment to the rural farming population.<ref name="zhang" />  The World Health Organization regarded RCMS as a “successful example of solving shortages or medical services in rural areas”.<ref name="zhang" /> Because of barefoot doctors providing primary health care so that basic health care is an affordable cost and give China’s entrance into the United Nations (UN) and WHO.<ref name="Cueto, M. 2004">Cueto, M. (2004). The Origins of Primary Health Care and Selective Primary Health Care. American Journal of Public Health , 1864-1872.</ref> Moreover, this also represents that some certain diseases in poor countries can be solved but just need adequate technological solution.<ref name="Cueto, M. 2004"/>

==End of barefoot doctors in China==
Two-thirds of the village doctors currently practicing in rural China began their training as barefoot doctors.<ref name="watts" /> This includes [[Chen Zhu]], China’s current Minister of Health, who practiced as a barefoot doctor for five years before going on to receive additional training.<ref name="watts">

The barefoot doctor system was abolished in 1981 with the end of the commune system of agricultural cooperatives. The new economic policy in China promoted a shift from collectivism to individual production by the family unit.<ref name="mcconnell" />  This shift caused a privatization of the medical system, which could not sustain the barefoot doctors.<ref name="mcconnell" /> The barefoot doctors were given the option to take a national exam, if they passed they became village doctors, if not they would be village health aides.  Village doctors began charging patients for their services,<ref name="mcconnell" /> and because of the new economic incentives,<ref name="zhang" /> they began to shift their focus to treatment of chronic conditions rather than preventative care.<ref name="zhang" />  

By 1984, village RCMS coverage had dropped from 90% to 4.8%.<ref name="carrin" />  In 1989 the Chinese government tried to restore a cooperative health care system in the rural provinces by launching a nationwide primary health care program.<ref name="carrin" />  This effort increased coverage up to 10% by 1993.<ref name="carrin" />  In 1994 the government established “The Program”, which was an effort to reestablish primary health care coverage for the rural population.<ref name="carrin" />

In 2003 the Chinese government proposed a new cooperative medical system that is operated and funded by the government.<ref name="zhang" /> This program is run more like an insurance program.<ref name="carrin" /> It pays 10 Renminbi per year for each person covered by the program, and by ensuring coverage for serious diseases.<ref name="zhang" /> This new program relies heavily on lessons learned from the times of the barefoot doctors, but faces many challenges in providing sufficient, cost-effective care for China’s rural populations.<ref name="zhang" />

==Historical legacy==
The system of barefoot doctors was among the most important inspirations for the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] conference in [[Alma Ata]], [[Kazakhstan]] in 1978 where the [[Alma Ata Declaration]] was signed unanimously.<ref>http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/12/08-021208/en/index.html</ref> This was hailed as a revolutionary breakthrough in international health ideology - it called for local communities participating in deciding health care priorities, called for an emphasis on [[primary health care]] and [[preventive medicine]], and most importantly sought to link medicine with trade, economics, industry, rural politics and other political and social areas.

==International development with NGOs==
[[File:Medecins aux pieds nus.PNG|Thumb|60px|right|[[NGO]]'s logo]]
In 1977, [[Jean-Pierre Willem]] created an international  humanitarian apolitical [[non-governmental organization|NGO]] of doctors called Medecins Aux Pieds Nus in France. 
Volunteers work  in [[Burundi]], [[Colombia]] and Southeast Asia with local healers to develop "medical garden" for [[herbalism]] and make essential oils for [[gemmotherapy]]. In 1999, [[Jean-Claude Rodet]] became the first president of Medecins Aux Pieds Nus [[Canada]] working with [[Mark Smith]]{{disambiguation needed|date=February 2013}} in United States. 
This NGO leads [[Ethnobiology|ethnobiological]] missions based on "proximity, [[Preventive medicine|prevention]] and humility"<ref>{{fr}} [[Jean-Pierre Willem]], ''Mémoires d'un médecin aux pieds nus'', édition Albin Michel - 2009, ISBN 978-2-226-18987-5, Paris.</ref>
