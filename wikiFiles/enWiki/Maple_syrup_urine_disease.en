'''Maple syrup urine disease''' (MSUD), also called '''branched-chain ketoaciduria''', is an [[autosomal]] [[Dominance (genetics)#Recessive trait|recessive]]<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10234605 |year=1999 |month=April |author=Podebrad F, Heil M, Reichert S, Mosandl A, Sewell AC, Böhles H |title=4,5-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-25H-furanone (sotolone)--the odour of maple syrup urine disease |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=107–114 |journal=Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease |doi=10.1023/A:1005433516026}}</ref> [[metabolic disorder]] affecting [[branched-chain amino acids]].

==Causes==
MSUD is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the [[branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex]] (BCKDC), leading to a buildup of the [[branched-chain amino acid]]s ([[leucine]], [[isoleucine]], and [[valine]]) and their toxic by-products (ketoacids) in the blood and urine. The [[multiprotein complex|enzyme complex]] consists of four [[protein subunit|subunits]] designated E<sub>1</sub>α, E<sub>1</sub>β, E<sub>2</sub>, and E<sub>3</sub>. The E<sub>3</sub> subunit is also a component of [[pyruvate dehydrogenase complex]] and [[oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex]].<ref name="Tietz2011">{{cite book |last1= Pasquali |first1= Marzia |last2= Longo |first2= Nicola |editor1-last= Burtis |editor1-first= Carl A. |editor2-last= Ashwood |editor2-first= Edward R. |editor3-last= Bruns |editor3-first= David E. |title= Tietz Textbook of Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Diagnostics |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=AiEV_gAACAAJ |edition=5th |date= December 13, 2011 |publisher= Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn= 978-1-4160-6164-9 |page=2062 |chapter= 58. Newborn screening and inborn errors of metabolism }}</ref> MSUD can result from mutations in any of the genes that code for the enzyme subunits.

== Diagnosis and symptoms ==
The disease is named for the presence of sweet-smelling urine, with an odor similar to that of [[maple syrup]]. The smell is also present and sometimes stronger in the [[ear wax]] of an affected individual.  Prior to the easy availability of plasma [[amino acid]] measurement, diagnosis was commonly made based on suggestive symptoms and odor.  Affected individuals are now often identified with characteristic elevations on plasma amino acids who do not have the characteristic odor.<ref name=omim>{{cite web|title= #248600  Maple Syrup Urine Disease; MSUD|url=http://omim.org/entry/248600|accessdate=2012-11-04|publisher=Johns Hopkins University}}</ref> The compound responsible for the odor is [[sotolon]] (sometimes spelled sotolone).<ref name=GeneReviews>{{Citation |last1= Strauss |first1= Kevin A |last2= Puffenberger |first2= Erik G |last3= Morton |first3= D Holmes |editor1-last=Pagon |editor1-first= Roberta A |editor2-last = Bird |editor2-first= Thomas D |editor3-last= Dolan |editor3-first= Cynthia R |editor4-last= Stephens |editor4-first= Karen |editor5-last= Adam |editor5-first= Margaret P |publication-date= December 15, 2009 |origyear= January 30, 2006 |title= GeneReviews™ [Internet] |chapter= Maple Syrup Urine Disease |chapter-url= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1319/ |publisher= University of Washington, Seattle |pmid= 20301495 |url= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1116/ |accessdate= May 15, 2012 }}</ref> Infants with this disease seem healthy at birth but if left untreated suffer severe [[brain damage]] and eventually die. 

From early infancy, symptoms of the condition include poor feeding, [[vomiting]], [[dehydration]], [[lethargy]], [[hypotonia]], [[seizure]]s, [[hypoglycaemia]], [[ketoacidosis]], [[opisthotonus]], [[pancreatitis]], [[coma]] and neurological decline.

==Classification==
Maple syrup urine disease can be classified by its pattern of signs and symptoms, or by its genetic cause. The most common and  severe form of the disease is the classic type, which appears soon after birth. Variant forms of the disorder may appear later in infancy or childhood and are typically less severe, but still involve mental and physical problems if left untreated.

There are several variations of the disease:

*Classic Severe MSUD
*Intermediate MSUD
*Intermittent MSUD
*Thiamine-responsive MSUD
*E3-Deficient MSUD with Lactic Acidosis

==Management==
Keeping MSUD under control requires careful monitoring of [[blood test|blood chemistry]] and involves both a special diet and frequent testing. 

A diet with minimal levels of the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine must be maintained in order to prevent neurological damage. As these three amino acids are required for proper metabolic function in all humans, specialized protein preparations containing substitutes and adjusted levels of the amino acids have been synthesized and tested, allowing MSUD patients to meet normal nutritional requirements without causing harm.<ref name="psynth">{{cite journal |author=Hallam P, Lilburn M, Lee PJ |title=A new protein substitute for adolescents and adults with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) |journal=J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=665–672 |year=2005 |pmid=16151896 |doi=10.1007/s10545-005-0061-6}}</ref> Some patients with MSUD may also improve with administration of high doses of [[thiamine]], a cofactor of the enzyme that causes the condition.

Usually, patients are also monitored by a [[dietitian]]. Their diet must be adhered to strictly and permanently. However, with proper management, those afflicted are able to live healthy, normal lives and not suffer the severe neurological damage associated with the  disease.

==Genetic prevalence==

[[Image:Autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Maple syrup urine disease has an autosomal recessive pattern of [[inheritance]].]]

Maple syrup urine disease affects approximately 1 out of 180,000 infants.<ref name="msudam" /> Due in part to the [[founder effect]],<ref name="fe">{{cite journal |author=Jaworski MA, Severini A, Mansour G, Konrad HM, Slater J, Henning K, Schlaut J, Yoon JW, Pak CY, Maclaren N, et al. |title=Genetic conditions among Canadian Mennonites: evidence for a founder effect among the old country (Chortitza) Mennonites |journal=Clin Invest Med |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=127–141 |year=1989 |pmid=2706837 }}</ref> however, MSUD has a much higher prevalence in children of [[Amish]], [[Mennonite]], and [[Jewish]] descent.<ref name="msudmp">{{cite journal |author=Puffenberger EG |title=Genetic heritage of Old Order Mennonites in southeastern Pennsylvania |journal=Am J Med Genet C Semin Med Genet. |volume=121 |issue=1 |pages=18–31 |year=2003 |pmid=12888983 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.c.20003 }}</ref><ref name="msudam">[http://rarediseases.about.com/od/rarediseases1/a/062004.htm http://rarediseases.about.com/od/rarediseases1/a/062004.htm] <br>About.com: Rare diseases - June 2004.

Mutations in the following genes cause maple syrup urine disease:

* [[BCKDHA]] ({{OMIM|608348}})
* [[BCKDHB]] ({{OMIM|248611}})
* [[DBT (gene)|DBT]] ({{OMIM|248610}})
* [[Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase|DLD]] ({{OMIM|238331}})

These four genes produce proteins that work together as the [[branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex]]. The complex is essential for breaking down the amino acids [[leucine]], [[isoleucine]], and [[valine]], which are present in many kinds of food (in particular, [[protein]]-rich foods such as milk, meat, and eggs). Mutations in any of these genes reduce or eliminate the function of the enzyme complex, preventing the normal breakdown of [[isoleucine]], [[leucine]], and [[valine]]. As a result, these amino acids and their by-products build up in the body. Because high levels of these substances are toxic to the [[brain]] and other organs, this accumulation leads to the serious medical problems associated with maple syrup urine disease.
 
This condition has an [[Human_genetics#Autosomal_recessive_inheritance|autosomal recessive inheritance pattern]], which means the defective gene is located on an [[autosome]], and two copies of the gene - one from each parent - must be inherited to be affected by the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are [[Genetic carrier|carriers]] of one copy of the defective gene, but are usually not affected by the disorder.
