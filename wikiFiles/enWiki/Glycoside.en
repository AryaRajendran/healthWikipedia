In [[chemistry]], a '''glycoside''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|l|aɪ|k|ə|s|aɪ|d}} is a [[molecule]] in which a [[sugar]] is bound to a non-carbohydrate [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]], usually a small organic molecule. Glycosides play numerous important roles in living organisms. Many plants store chemicals in the form of inactive glycosides. These can be activated by [[enzymatic|enzyme]] [[hydrolysis]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Brito-Arias|first=Marco|title=Synthesis and Characterization of Glycosides|publisher=Springer|year=2007|isbn=978-0-387-26251-2}}</ref> which causes the sugar part to be broken off, making the chemical available for use. Many such plant glycosides are used as [[medication]]s. In animals and humans, poisons are often bound to sugar molecules as part of their elimination from the body.

In formal terms, a glycoside is any molecule in which a sugar group is bonded through its [[anomeric carbon]] to another group via a [[glycosidic bond]]. Glycosides can be linked by an O- (an ''O-glycoside''), N- (a ''[[glycosylamine]]''), S-(a ''thioglycoside''), or C- (a ''C-glycoside'') glycosidic bond. The given definition is the one used by [[IUPAC]], which recommends the [[Haworth projection]] to correctly assign [[stereochemical]] configurations.<ref>{{Cite book

}}</ref> Many authors require in addition that the sugar be bonded to a ''non-sugar'' for the molecule to qualify as a glycoside, thus excluding [[polysaccharide]]s. The sugar group is then known as the '''glycone''' and the non-sugar group as the '''[[aglycone]]''' or '''genin''' part of the glycoside. The glycone can consist of a single sugar group ([[monosaccharide]]) or several sugar groups ([[oligosaccharide]]).

The first glycoside ever identified was [[amygdalin]], by the French chemists [[Pierre-Jean Robiquet|Pierre Robiquet]] and [[:fr:Antoine François Boutron Charlard|Antoine Boutron-Charlard]], in 1830.<ref>{{cite journal |title={{lang|fr|Nouvelles expériences sur les amandes amères et sur l'huile volatile qu'elles fournissent}} |last=Robiquet |last2=Boutron-Charlard |journal=Annales de chimie et de physique |volume=44 |year=1830 |issue= |pages=352–382 |doi= |pmid= }}</ref>

==Related compounds==

Molecules containing an N-glycosidic bond are known as [[glycosylamine]]s and are not discussed in this article. (Many authors in [[biochemistry]] call these compounds ''N-glycosides'' and group them with the glycosides; this is considered a misnomer and discouraged by [[IUPAC]].) Glycosylamines and glycosides are grouped together as [[glycoconjugates]]; other glycoconjugates are [[glycoproteins]], [[glycopeptides]], [[peptidoglycans]], [[glycolipids]], and [[lipopolysaccharides]].

==Chemistry==

Much of the chemistry of glycosides is explained in the article on [[glycosidic bond]]s. For example, the glycone and aglycone portions can be chemically separated by [[hydrolysis]] in the presence of [[acid]] and can be hydrolyzed by [[alkali]]. There are also numerous [[enzyme]]s that can form and break glycosidic bonds. The most important cleavage enzymes are the [[glycoside hydrolases]], and the most important synthetic enzymes in nature are [[glycosyltransferases]]. Genetically altered enzymes termed [[glycosynthases]] have been developed that can form glycosidic bonds in excellent yield.

There are a great many ways to chemically synthesize glycosidic bonds. [[Fischer glycosidation]] refers to the synthesis of glycosides by the reaction of unprotected monosaccharides with alcohols (usually as solvent) in the presence of a strong acid catalyst. The [[Koenigs-Knorr reaction]] is the condensation of glycosyl halides and alcohols in the presence of metal salts such as silver carbonate or mercuric oxide.

==Classification==

Glycosides can be classified by the glycone, by the type of glycosidic bond, and by the aglycone.

===By glycone/presence of sugar===

If the glycone group of a glycoside is [[glucose]], then the molecule is a [[glucoside]]; if it is [[fructose]], then the molecule is a [[fructoside]]; if it is [[glucuronic acid]], then the molecule is a [[glucuronide]]; etc. In the body, toxic substances are often bonded to glucuronic acid to increase their water solubility; the resulting glucuronides are then excreted.

===By type of glycosidic bond===

Depending on whether the glycosidic bond lies "below" or "above" the plane of the cyclic sugar molecule, glycosides are classified as '''α-glycosides''' or '''β-glycosides'''. Some enzymes such as [[amylase|α-amylase]] can only hydrolyze α-linkages; others, such as [[emulsin]], can only affect β-linkages.

There are four type of linkages present between glycone and aglycone:
* C-linkage/glycosidic bond, "nonhydrolysable by acids or enzymes"
* O-linkage/glycosidic bond
* N-linkage/glycosidic bond
* S-linkage/glycosidic bond

=== By aglycone ===

Glycosides are also classified according to the chemical nature of the aglycone. For purposes of biochemistry and pharmacology, this is the most useful classification.

==== Alcoholic glycosides ====
An example of an [[alcohol]]ic glycoside is [[salicin]], which is found in the genus ''[[salix]]''. Salicin is converted in the body into [[salicylic acid]], which is closely related to [[aspirin]] and has [[analgesic]], [[antipyretic]], and [[inflammation|antiinflammatory]] effects.

==== Anthraquinone glycosides ====
These glycosides contain an aglycone group that is a derivative of [[natural anthraquinone|anthraquinone]]. They have a [[laxative]] effect. They are mainly found in [[dicot]] plants except the [[Liliaceae]] family which are [[monocot]]s. They are present in [[senna (herb)|senna]], [[rhubarb]] and ''[[Aloe]]'' species. Antron and anthranol are reduced forms of anthraquinone.

==== Coumarin glycosides ====
Here the aglycone is [[coumarin]] or a derivative. An example is [[apterin]] which is reported to dilate the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]] as well as block [[calcium channel]]s. Other coumarin glycosides are obtained from dried leaves of ''[[Psoralea corylifolia]]''.

==== Chromone glycosides ====
In this case, the aglycone is benzo-gamma-pyrone.

==== Cyanogenic glycosides ====
[[File:Amygdalin skeletal.png|200px|thumb|[[Amygdalin]]]]
In this case, the aglycone contains a [[cyanide]] group. All of these plants have these glycosides stored in the [[vacuole]], but, if the plant is attacked, they are released and become activated by enzymes in the [[cytoplasm]]. These remove the sugar part of the molecule and release toxic [[hydrogen cyanide]]. Storing them in inactive forms in the cytoplasm prevents them from damaging the plant under normal conditions.

An example of these is [[amygdalin]] from [[almond]]s. They can also be found in the fruits (and wilting leaves) of the [[Rosaceae|rose family]] (including [[cherry|cherries]], [[apple]]s, [[plum]]s, almonds, [[peach]]es, [[apricot]]s, [[raspberry|raspberries]], and [[crabapple]]s). [[Cassava]], an important food plant in Africa and South America, contains cyanogenic glycosides and, therefore, has to be washed and ground under running water prior to consumption. [[Sorghum]] (''Sorghum bicolor'') expresses cyanogenic glycosides in its roots and, thus, is resistant to pests such as rootworms ([[Diabrotica]] spp.) that plague its cousin [[maize]] (''Zea mays'' L.). It was once thought that cyanogenic glycosides might have anti-[[cancer]] properties, but this idea was disproven (see [[Amygdalin#Cancer_treatment|Amygdalin]]). A recent study may also show that increasing {{co2}} levels may result in much higher levels of cyanogenic glycoside production in [[sorghum]] and [[cassava]] plants, making them highly toxic and inconsumable. A doubling of {{co2}} concentration was found to double the concentration of cyanogenic glycosides in the leaves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327163.100-cassavas-get-cyanide-hike-from-carbon-emissions.html|title=Cassavas get cyanide hike from carbon emissions - environment |date=13 July 2009 |work=New Scientist |accessdate=2009-07-13|last=|first=}}
</ref><ref name=RosGleadow>{{cite web|title=Staples such as cassava on which millions of people depend become more toxic and produce much smaller yields in a world with higher carbon dioxide levels and more drought|work=Yahoo.com|year=2009 |month=July |url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/22/20090629/tsc-environment-us-climate-crops-011ccfa.html}}</ref>

[[Dhurrin]], [[linamarin]], [[lotaustralin]], and [[prunasin]] are also classified as cyanogenic glycosides.

====Flavonoid glycosides====
Here the aglycone is a [[flavonoid]]. Examples of this large group of glycosides include:
*[[Hesperidin]] (aglycone: [[Hesperetin]], glycone: [[Rutinose]])
*[[Naringin]] (aglycone: [[Naringenin]], glycone: [[Rutinose]])
*[[Rutin]] (aglycone: [[Quercetin]], glycone: [[Rutinose]])
*[[Quercitrin]] (aglycone: [[Quercetin]], glycone: [[Rhamnose]])

Among the important effects of flavonoids are their [[antioxidant]] effect. They are also known to decrease [[capillary]] fragility.

====Phenolic glycosides (simple)====
Here the aglycone is a simple [[natural phenol|phenol]]ic structure. An example is [[arbutin]] found in the [[Bearberry|Common Bearberry]] ''Arctostaphylos uva-ursi''. It has a urinary antiseptic effect.

====Saponins====
{{main|Saponin}}
These compounds give a permanent froth when shaken with water. They also cause [[hemolysis]] of [[red blood cell]]s. Saponin glycosides are found in [[liquorice]]. Their medicinal value is due to their [[expectorant]], and [[corticoid]] and [[anti-inflammatory]] effects. Steroid saponins, for example, in [[Dioscorea]] [[wild yam]] the [[sapogenin]] [[diosgenin]]—in form of its glycoside [[dioscin]]—is an important starting material for production of semi-synthetic [[glucocorticoids]] and other [[steroid hormones]] such as [[progesterone]]. The [[ginsenosides]] are [[triterpene]] [[glycosides]] and Ginseng saponins from ''Panax Ginseng'' C. A. Meyer, (Chinese [[ginseng]]) and ''Panax quinquefolius'' ([[American Ginseng]]).
In general, the use of the term saponin in organic chemistry is discouraged, because many plant constituents can produce [[foam]], and many [[triterpene]]-[[glycosides]] are amphipolar under certain conditions, acting as a [[surfactant]].
More modern uses of saponins in biotechnology are as [[adjuvants]] in [[vaccines]]:  Quil A and its derivative QS-21, isolated from the bark of [[Quillaja saponaria]] Molina, to stimulate both the Th1 immune response and the production of [[cytotoxic T-lymphocytes]] (CTLs) against exogenous antigens make them ideal for use in subunit vaccines and vaccines directed against intracellular pathogens as well as for therapeutic cancer vaccines but with the aforementioned side-effects of [[hemolysis]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Hong-Xiang |last=Sun |first2=Yong |last2=Xie |first3=Yi-Ping |last3=Ye |year=2009 |title=Advances in saponin-based adjuvants |journal=[[Vaccine (journal)|Vaccine]] |volume=27 |issue=12 |pages=1787–1796 |url=http://www.zju-klep.com/UserUpload/fck/20100123103518.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.01.091 }}</ref>

====Steroidal glycosides or cardiac glycosides====
Here the aglycone part is a [[steroid]]al nucleus. These glycosides are found in the plant genera ''[[Digitalis]]'', ''[[Scilla]]'', and ''[[Strophanthus]]''. They are used in the treatment of [[heart disease]]s, e.g., [[congestive heart failure]] (historically as now recognised does not improve survivability; other agents are now preferred) and [[arrhythmia]].

====Steviol glycosides====
{{main|Steviol glycoside}}
These sweet glycosides found in the [[stevia]] plant ''Stevia rebaudiana'' Bertoni have 40-300 times the sweetness of [[sucrose]]. The two primary glycosides, stevioside and rebaudioside A, are used as natural [[Sugar substitute|sweeteners]] in many countries. These glycosides have [[steviol]] as the aglycone part. [[Glucose]] or [[rhamnose]]-glucose combinations are bound to the ends of the aglycone to form the different compounds.

====Thioglycosides====
As the name implies (q.v. [[thio-]]), these compounds contain [[sulfur]]. Examples include [[sinigrin]], found in [[black mustard]], and [[sinalbin]], found in [[white mustard]].
