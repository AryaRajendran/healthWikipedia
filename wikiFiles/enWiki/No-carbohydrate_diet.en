A '''no-carbohydrate diet''' ('''no-carb diet''') excludes dietary consumption of all [[carbohydrates]] and suggests [[fat]] as the main source of energy with sufficient [[protein]]. A no-carbohydrate diet is [[ketogenic]], which means it causes the body to go into a state of [[ketosis]], converting dietary fat and [[body fat]] into [[ketone bodies]] and using them to fuel the entire body and up to 95% of the [[brain]]. The remaining 5% still runs on [[glucose]] which is adequately supplied by converting dietary protein via [[gluconeogenesis]] or by converting [[glycerol]] from the breakdown of fat. It uses mainly [[animal source foods]] and requires a high [[saturated fat]] intake.

==History==
An early proponent of an all animal-based diet was [[Icelandic people|Icelandic]]-[[Immigration to Canada|Canadian]] [[Arctic exploration|explorer]] [[Vilhjalmur Stefansson]]  (1879 – 1962),  who lived with the [[Inuit]] for some time and witnessed their [[Inuit diet|diet]] as essentially consisting of [[Inuit_diet#Hunting|meat]] and [[Inuit_diet#Fish|fish]], with very few carbohydrates -— just [[berries]] during the summer. Stefansson and a friend later volunteered for a one year experiment at [[Bellevue Hospital Center]] in [[New York City]] to prove he could thrive on a diet of nothing but meat, meat fat and internal organs of animals.<ref>{{cite journal | author = McClellan WS, Du Bois EF | year = 1930 | title = Clinical calorimetry.

Chem. | volume = 87 | issue =3 | pages = 651–668 }}</ref>  His progress was closely monitored and experiments were done on his health throughout the year.  At the end of the year, he did not show any symptoms of ill health; he did not develop [[scurvy]], which many scientists had expected to manifest itself only a few months into the diet due to the lack of [[vitamin C]] in muscle meat. However, Stefansson and his partner did not eat just muscle meat but also fat, raw brain, raw liver (a significant source of vitamin C and others), and other varieties of [[offal]]. 

One of the first registries on no-carbohydrate diets was in 1860 when English [[casket]] maker [[William Banting]] was prompted to lose weight and decided to write “Letter on Corpulence”, which aimed to completely avoid [[starch]] and [[sugar]]. Banting lost 45 pounds on a diet composed by lean meat, dry toast, soft [[boiled egg]]s and a few drinks a day. Thus, the Banting diet became a very well known method back then in the [[19th century]], promoted also for weight loss and [[diabetes]] control.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_19/ai_95632084/ 1860s: first low-carb diet] CBS Money Watch. Retrieved 2010-08-26</ref>

More than a century after this, carbohydrate-restricted diets gained great popularity, particularly in the case of the [[Atkins Diet]] which emerged in 1972, thanks to [[Robert Atkins (nutritionist)|Robert Atkins]]. While his diet is not a zero-carbohydrate diet, it does reduce carb intake to a ketogenic level in its initial stages (20&nbsp;grams daily in [[Atkins_Diet#Induction|Induction]]; weekly increase of 5 thereafter), allowing followers to take advantage of the fat-burning mechanism that is [[ketosis]]. According to Atkins, this nutritional approach is more effective for weight loss than a low-fat, “high carbohydrate diet”, although there has always been much controversy and great dispute amongst healthcare professionals concerning drastic carbohydrate restriction.<ref>[http://www.buzzle.com/articles/no-carb-diet-plan.html/ No Carb Diet Plan] CBS Money Watch.

==No-carbohydrate foods==
Foods that lack carbohydrates include:
*Meats: [[beef]], [[pork]], [[venison]], etc
*[[Seafood]]:   [[tuna]], [[trout]], [[flounder]], [[sardine]]s, [[scallops]] [[herring]], etc
*[[Egg]]s
*[[Cheese]]s: [[cheddar]], [[goat cheese]], [[Gouda]], [[blue cheese]], etc
*[[Fat]]s: [[butter]], [[cream]], [[suet]], [[lard]], [[marrow]], etc

== Research on effects of no-carbohydrate diet ==
According to observational and prospectively designed studies from physicians and nutrition scientists, impaired physical performance is a common but not an obligate result of a low carbohydrate diet or no-carbohydrate diet. However, therapeutic use of ketogenic diets should not require restriction of any physical labor or recreational activity, with the particularity that only [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic performance]] is limited, such as [[Olympic weightlifting|weight lifting]]. In this case, due to the low glycogen levels in the ketogenic diet, competitive athletes cannot follow this kind of diet.

In 1939 two Danish scientists, Christensen and Hansen, made a study of low carbohydrate, moderate carbohydrate and high carbohydrate diets, each one lasting at least one week. At the end of each diet, the subjects' endurance time to exhaustion on a [[stationary bicycle]] was measured, and they found that with the low carbohydrate they lasted only 81 minutes, while they were able to ride for 206 minutes after the high carbohydrates  diet.

In 1946, another experiment was made by Kark, Johnson and Lewis to determine effects of pemmican (a mixture of fat and dry meat) as an emergency ration for infantry troops in winter training in the Canadian Arctic.  Results on this study showed that in 3 days, soldiers were unable to complete their assigned tasks. Then, in the 1960s, with the resurgence of biomedical science, new research revealed that fat had limited utility as fuel for high intensity exercise, and that humans are physically impaired if they are given a low carbohydrate or no-carbohydrate diet.<ref>Phinney, Stephen D.(2004-08-17)[http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/1/1/2/ Ketogenic diets and physical performance] Nutrition and Metabolism. Retrieved 2010-08-26</ref>

A living example that a ketogenic diet can indeed be combined with outstanding achievements in physical exercise is the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[Biathlon World Championships|biathlon]] gold medalist [[Björn Ferry]], who won his gold medal after about 6 months on a low-carbohydrate high-fat diet.<ref>Dagens Nyheter: Ferry's gold recipe , (in Swedish)[http://www.dn.se/mat-dryck/reportage/ferrys-guldrecept]</ref>

At the [[Center for Obesity Research and Education]] at [[Temple University]], [[Philadelphia]], researchers found recently that after a two-year comparison, a low carbohydrate diet is almost similar to low-fat diet in terms of weight loss, but low-carbohydrate improves cardiovascular risk factors more, such as [[blood pressure]] and [[blood lipid]] levels. This study would  suggest that low-carbohydrate diet protects individuals from potential [[coronary heart disease]]s in a more effective way. 307 patients were randomly assigned to either one of the two diets and researchers found 2 years later that [[good cholesterol]] levels were higher among the low-carbohydrate group compared to the low-fat group, 23% and 11% respectively.<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/196710.php/ Low Carb Better for Cardiovascular Health than Low Fat Diet] Medical News Today. Retrieved 2010-08-26</ref>

On the other side, a study by the [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]] (BIDMC), a teaching hospital of [[Harvard Medical School]], revealed after a study made on mice with different diets that with a low-carbohydrate there is a significant impact on atherosclerosis, even though it didn't affect cholesterol levels. Anthony Rosenzweig, a professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, found that the increase in plaque build-up in the blood vessels and the impaired ability to form new vessels were associated with a reduction in vascular progenitor cells, which some researchers claim could play a protective role in keeping vascular health.<ref>Prescott, Bonnie.

Alexander Ströhle, Maike Wolters and Andreas Hahn, with the Department of Food Science at the [[University of Hanover]], rely on Bjerregaard et al.

There are still some questions about the long term effects on health adopting a no-carbohydrate diet.  In 2005, the [[British Heart Foundation]] recommended not to follow these kind of diets, for those individuals who want to lose weight and take care of their heart. Working together with the [[Oxford University]] team, they found that the energy stored in the heart was reduced by an average of 16% among those who followed a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4435046.stm/ Low-carb diets 'cut heart energy'] BBC News. Retrieved 2010-08-26</ref>

When the [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]] (BIDMC) found in their investigation that this diet is associated with serious artery damage in animals, [[The Stroke Association]] in the UK added that with foods as red meat and dairy products, containing high levels of saturated fat, are the ones that cause the buildup in the arteries. Researchers suggested having a moderate and balanced diet, coupled with regular exercise.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8218780.stm/ Low carb diets 'damage arteries'] BBC News.
