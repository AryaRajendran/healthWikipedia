{{Main|Myocardial infarction}}

'''Myocardial infarction complications''' may occur immediately following a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] (in the [[Acute (medical)|acute]] phase), or may need time to develop (a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] problem). After an infarction, an obvious complication is a second infarction, which may occur in the domain of another atherosclerotic coronary artery, or in the same zone if there are any live cells left in the infarct.

==Congestive heart failure==
{{Main|Congestive heart failure}}
A myocardial infarction may compromise the function of the heart as a pump for the [[Circulatory system|circulation]], a state called [[heart failure]]. There are different types of heart failure; left- or right-sided (or bilateral) heart failure may occur depending on the affected part of the heart, and it is a low-output type of failure. If one of the heart valves is affected, this may cause dysfunction, such as [[mitral regurgitation]] in the case of left-sided coronary occlusion that disrupts the blood supply of the papillary muscles. The incidence of heart failure is particularly high in patients with diabetes and requires special management strategies.<ref name="Canto-2000">{{cite journal | author=Canto JG, Shlipak MG, Rogers WJ, Malmgren JA, Frederick PD, Lambrew CT, Ornato JP, Barron HV, Kiefe CI. | title=Prevalence, clinical characteristics, and mortality among patients with myocardial infarction presenting without chest pain | journal=JAMA | year=2000 | volume=283 | issue=24 | pages=3223–9 | pmid=10866870 | doi = 10.1001/jama.283.24.3223}}</ref>

==Myocardial rupture==
{{Main|Myocardial rupture}}
[[Myocardial rupture]] is most common three to five days after myocardial infarction, commonly of small degree, but may occur one day to three weeks later.  In the modern era of early revascularization and intensive pharmacotherapy as treatment for MI, the incidence of myocardial rupture is about 1% of all MIs.<ref name="Yip-2003">{{cite journal | author=Yip HK, Wu CJ, Chang HW, Wang CP, Cheng CI, Chua S, Chen MC. | title=Cardiac rupture complicating acute myocardial infarction in the direct percutaneous coronary intervention reperfusion era | journal=Chest | year=2003 | volume=124 | issue=2 | pages=565–71 | format=[[PDF]] | url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/reprint/124/2/565.pdf | pmid=12907544 | doi = 10.1378/chest.124.2.565}}</ref>  This may occur in the free walls of the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]], the [[septum]] between them, the [[papillary muscles]], or less commonly the [[Atrium (heart)|atria]]. Rupture occurs because of increased pressure against the weakened walls of the heart chambers due to heart muscle that cannot pump blood out effectively. The weakness may also lead to ventricular [[aneurysm]], a localized dilation or ballooning of the heart chamber.

Risk factors for myocardial rupture include completion of infarction (no revascularization performed), female sex, advanced age, and a lack of a previous history of myocardial infarction.<ref name="Yip-2003"/>  In addition, the risk of rupture is higher in individuals who are revascularized with a thrombolytic agent than with PCI.<ref name="Becker-1996">{{cite journal | author=Becker RC, Gore JM, Lambrew C, Weaver WD, Rubison RM, French WJ, Tiefenbrunn AJ, Bowlby LJ, Rogers WJ. | title=A composite view of cardiac rupture in the United States National Registry of Myocardial Infarction | journal=J Am Coll Cardiol | year=1996 | volume=27 | issue=6 | pages=1321–6 | pmid=8626938 | doi = 10.1016/0735-1097(96)00008-3}}</ref><ref name="Moreno-2002">{{cite journal | author=Moreno R, Lopez-Sendon J, Garcia E, Perez de Isla L, Lopez de Sa E, Ortega A, Moreno M, Rubio R, Soriano J, Abeytua M, Garcia-Fernandez MA. | title=Primary angioplasty reduces the risk of left ventricular free wall rupture compared with thrombolysis in patients with acute myocardial infarction | journal=J Am Coll Cardiol | year=2002 | volume=39 | issue=4 | pages=598–603 | pmid=11849857 | doi = 10.1016/S0735-1097(01)01796-X}}</ref>  The shear stress between the infarcted segment and the surrounding normal myocardium (which may be hypercontractile in the post-infarction period) makes it a nidus for rupture.<ref name="Shin-1983">{{cite journal | author=Shin P, Sakurai M, Minamino T, Onishi S, Kitamura H. | title=Postinfarction cardiac rupture.

Rupture is usually a catastrophic event that may result a life-threatening process known as [[cardiac tamponade]], in which blood accumulates within the [[pericardium]] or heart sac, and compresses the heart to the point where it cannot pump effectively. Rupture of the intraventricular septum (the muscle separating the left and right ventricles) causes a [[ventricular septal defect]] with [[Shunt (medical)|shunting]] of blood through the defect from the left side of the heart to the right side of the heart, which can lead to right ventricular failure as well as pulmonary overcirculation.  Rupture of the papillary muscle may also lead to acute [[mitral regurgitation]] and subsequent [[pulmonary edema]] and possibly even [[cardiogenic shock]].

==Arrhythmia==
[[File:Electrocardiogram of Ventricular Tachycardia.png|right|thumb|A 12 lead [[electrocardiogram]] showing [[ventricular tachycardia]].]]
Since the electrical characteristics of the infarcted tissue change (see [[Myocardial infarction#Pathophysiology|pathophysiology section]]), [[arrhythmias]] are a frequent complication.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cardiac Arrhythmia: Mechanisms, Diagnosis, and Management |last=Podrid |first=Philip J. |coauthors=Peter R.

==Pericarditis==
{{Main|Pericarditis}}
As a reaction to the damage of the heart muscle, [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] cells are attracted. The inflammation may reach out and affect the heart sac. This is called [[pericarditis]]. In [[Dressler's syndrome]], this occurs several weeks after the initial event.

==Cardiogenic shock==
A complication that may occur in the acute setting soon after a myocardial infarction or in the weeks following is [[cardiogenic shock]].  Cardiogenic shock is defined as a hemodynamic state in which the heart cannot produce enough of a [[cardiac output]] to supply an adequate amount of oxygenated blood to the  tissues of the body.

While the data on performing interventions on individuals with cardiogenic shock is sparse, trial data suggests a long-term mortality benefit in undergoing revascularization if the individual is less than 75 years old and if the onset of the acute myocardial infarction is less than 36 hours and the onset of cardiogenic shock is less than 18 hours.<ref name="Hochman-1999">{{cite journal | author=Hochman JS, Sleeper LA, Webb JG, Sanborn TA, White HD, Talley JD, Buller CE, Jacobs AK, Slater JN, Col J, McKinlay SM, LeJemtel TH. | title=Early revascularization in acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock.
