'''Oxytocin''' (Oxt) ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|ɒ|k|s|ɨ|ˈ|t|oʊ|s|ɪ|n}}) is a [[mammal]]ian [[neurohypophysial hormone]] that acts primarily as a [[neuromodulator]] in the [[brain]].

Oxytocin plays roles in [[sexual reproduction]], in particular during and after [[childbirth]]. It is released in large amounts after distension of the [[cervix]] and [[uterus]] during labor, facilitating [[childbirth|birth]], [[maternal bonding]], and, after stimulation of the [[nipple]]s, [[breastfeeding]]. Both childbirth and milk ejection result from [[positive feedback]] mechanisms.<ref>Marieb Human Anatomy & Physiology 9th edition, chapter:16, page:599</ref>

Recent studies have begun to investigate oxytocin's role in various behaviors, including [[orgasm]], [[social recognition]], [[pair bond]]ing, [[anxiety]], and maternal behaviors.<ref name="pmid19482229">{{cite journal | author = Lee HJ, Macbeth AH, Pagani JH, Young WS | title = Oxytocin: the great facilitator of life | journal = Prog.

== Discovery ==

==Structure and relation to vasopressin==
Oxytocin is a [[peptide]] of nine [[amino acid]]s (a [[nonapeptide]]). Its systematic name is cysteine-tyrosine-isoleucine-glutamine-asparagine-cysteine-proline-leucine-glycine-amine  ([[cysteine|cys]] – [[tyrosine|tyr]] – [[isoleucine|ile]] – [[glutamine|gln]] – [[asparagine|asn]] – [[cysteine|cys]] – [[proline|pro]] – [[leucine|leu]] – [[glycine|gly]] – NH<sub>2</sub>, or CYIQNCPLG-NH<sub>2</sub>). Oxytocin has a [[molecular mass]] of 1007 [[dalton (unit)|dalton]]s. One [[international unit]] (IU) of oxytocin is the equivalent of about 2 [[microgram]]s of pure peptide. While the structure of oxytocin is highly conserved in placental mammals, a novel structure of oxytocin was recently reported in [[marmosets]], [[tamarins]], and other new world [[primates]]. Genomic sequencing of the gene for oxytocin revealed a single [[In-frame_mutation#in-frame|in-frame mutation]]([[thymine]] for [[cytosine]]) which results in a single amino acid substitution at the 8-position ([[proline]] for [[leucine]]).<ref name="pmid21411453">{{cite journal | author = Lee AG, Cool DR, Grunwald WC, Neal DE, Buckmaster CL, Cheng MY, Hyde SA, Lyons DM, Parker KJ | title = A novel form of oxytocin in New World monkeys | journal = Biol.

The biologically active form of oxytocin, commonly measured by [[Radioimmunoassay|RIA]] and/or [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] techniques, is also known as the octapeptide "oxytocin disulfide" (oxidized form), but oxytocin also exists as a reduced dithiol nonapeptide called oxytoceine.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = du Vigneaud V. | title = Experiences in the Polypeptide Field: Insulin to Oxytocin | journal = Ann.

[[File:Oxytocin-neurophysin.png|thumb|240px|left|Oxytocin (ball-and-stick) bound to its carrier protein neurophysin (ribbons)]]
The structure of oxytocin is very similar to that of [[vasopressin]] (cys – tyr – <u>[[phenylalanine|phe]]</u> – gln – asn – cys – pro – <u>[[arginine|arg]]</u> – gly – NH<sub>2</sub>), also a nonapeptide with a sulfur bridge, whose sequence differs from oxytocin by two amino acids. A table showing the sequences of members of the vasopressin/oxytocin superfamily and the species expressing them is present in the [[vasopressin]] article. Oxytocin and vasopressin were isolated and synthesized by [[Vincent du Vigneaud]] in 1953, work for which he received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1955.

Oxytocin and vasopressin are the only known hormones released by the human posterior [[pituitary gland]] to act at a distance. However, oxytocin neurons make other peptides, including [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] and [[dynorphin]], for example, that act locally. The magnocellular neurons that make oxytocin are adjacent to magnocellular neurons that make vasopressin, and are similar in many respects.

<!-- The last paragraph should be expanded upon or deleted. It is relevant enough to remain(though only because of previous referrences to vasopressin), but that it says "and are similar in several respects" and does not give a reference or attempt to explain itself is unacceptable. This "fact" may be sufficient for the creation of another article. -->

==Actions==
Oxytocin has peripheral (hormonal) actions, and also has actions in the brain. Its actions are mediated by specific, high-affinity [[oxytocin receptor]]s. The oxytocin receptor is a [[G-protein-coupled receptor]] that requires [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup> and [[cholesterol]]. It belongs to the [[rhodopsin]]-type (class I) group of G-protein-coupled receptors.

===Peripheral (hormonal) actions===
The peripheral actions of oxytocin mainly reflect secretion from the [[pituitary gland]]. (See [[oxytocin receptor]] for more detail on its action.)

* [[Letdown reflex]]: In [[lactation|lactating]] ([[breastfeeding]]) mothers, oxytocin acts at the [[mammary gland]]s, causing milk to be 'let down' into [[areola|subareolar]] [[sinuses]], from where it can be excreted via the [[nipple]].<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/976504-overview</ref> Suckling by the [[infant]] at the nipple is relayed by spinal nerves to the [[hypothalamus]]. The stimulation causes neurons that make oxytocin to fire action potentials in intermittent bursts; these bursts result in the secretion of pulses of oxytocin from the neurosecretory nerve terminals of the pituitary gland.
*[[Uterine contraction]]: Important for [[cervical dilation]] before birth, oxytocin causes contractions during the second and third stages of [[labor (childbirth)|labor]]. Oxytocin release during breastfeeding causes mild but often painful contractions during the first few weeks of lactation. This also serves to assist the uterus in clotting the placental attachment point postpartum. However, in [[knockout mouse|knockout mice]] lacking the oxytocin receptor, reproductive behavior and [[parturition]] are normal.<ref name="Takayanagi">{{cite journal | author = Takayanagi Y, Yoshida M, Bielsky IF, Ross HE, Kawamata M, Onaka T, Yanagisawa T, Kimura T, Matzuk MM, Young LJ, Nishimori K | title = Pervasive social deficits, but normal parturition, in oxytocin receptor-deficient mice | journal = Proc.

* [[Social behavior]] and [[wound healing]]: Oxytocin is also thought to modulate [[inflammation]] by decreasing certain [[cytokines]]. Thus, the increased release in oxytocin following positive social interactions has the potential to improve wound healing. A study by Marazziti and colleagues used heterosexual couples to address this possibility. They found increases in plasma oxytocin following a social interaction were correlated with faster wound healing.  They hypothesized this was due to oxytocin reducing inflammation, thus allowing the wound to heal faster. This study provides preliminary evidence that positive social interactions may directly impact aspects of health.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Gouin JP, Carter S, Pournajafi-Nazarloo H, Glaser R, Malarkey WB, Loving TJ, Stowell J, and Kiecolt-Glaser JK|title= Marital Behavior, Oxytocin, Vasopressin, and Wound Healing|journal= Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=35|issue=7|pages=1082–1090|year=2010|doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2010.01.009|PMID=20144509|pmc=2888874|pmid=20144509}}</ref>

=== Actions within the brain ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Zoophilia]] -->
Oxytocin secreted from the [[pituitary gland]] cannot re-enter the brain because of the [[blood–brain barrier]]. Instead, the behavioral effects of oxytocin are thought to reflect release from centrally projecting oxytocin neurons, different from those that project to the pituitary gland, or that are collaterals from them.<ref name="Ross"/> Oxytocin receptors are expressed by neurons in many parts of the brain and spinal cord, including the amygdala, [[ventromedial hypothalamus]], [[septum]], [[nucleus accumbens]], and [[brainstem]].

* Sexual arousal: Oxytocin injected into the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] causes spontaneous [[erection]]s in rats,<ref name="Gimpl">{{Cite journal|author=Gimpl G, Fahrenholz F |title=The oxytocin receptor system: structure, function, and regulation |journal=Physiological Reviews |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=629–83 |year=2001 |month=April |pmid=11274341 |url=http://physrev.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11274341}}</ref> reflecting actions in the hypothalamus and spinal cord. Centrally administrated oxytocin receptor antagonists can prevent noncontact erections, which is a measure of sexual arousal.

* Bonding: In the [[prairie vole]], oxytocin released into the brain of the female during sexual activity is important for forming a monogamous pair bond with her sexual partner. Vasopressin appears to have a similar effect in males.<ref>[http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/high-on-fidelity Vacek M,  High on Fidelity.

Injected oxytocin analogues are used for [[labor induction]] and to support labor in case of difficult parturition. It has largely replaced [[ergometrine]] as the principal agent to increase uterine tone in acute [[postpartum hemorrhage]]. Oxytocin is also used in [[veterinary medicine]] to facilitate birth and to stimulate milk release. The [[tocolytic]] agent [[atosiban]] (Tractocile) acts as an antagonist of oxytocin receptors; this drug is registered in many countries to suppress premature labor between 24 and 33 weeks of gestation. It has fewer side effects than drugs previously used for this purpose ([[ritodrine]], [[salbutamol]], and [[terbutaline]]).

===Neural sources===
In the [[hypothalamus]], oxytocin is made in [[magnocellular neurosecretory cell]]s of the [[supraoptic nucleus|supraoptic]] and [[paraventricular nucleus|paraventricular]] nuclei, and is stored in [[Herring bodies]] at the axon terminals in the posterior pituitary. It is then released into the blood from the [[posterior pituitary|posterior lobe]] ([[neurohypophysis]]) of the [[pituitary gland]]. These [[axons]] (likely, but [[dendrites]] have not been ruled out) have collaterals that innervate oxytocin receptors in the [[nucleus accumbens]].<ref name="Ross">{{cite journal | author = Ross HE, Cole CD, Smith Y, Neumann ID, Landgraf R, Murphy AZ, Young LJ | title = Characterization of the oxytocin system regulating affiliative behavior in female prairie voles | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 162 | issue = 4 | pages = 892–903 | year = 2009 | month = September | pmid = 19482070 | pmc = 2744157 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.05.055 }}</ref> The peripheral hormonal and behavioral brain effects of oxytocin are thought to be coordinated through its common release through these collaterals.<ref name="Ross"/> Oxytocin is also made by some neurons in the paraventricular nucleus that project to other parts of the brain and to the spinal cord.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Landgraf R, Neumann ID |title=Vasopressin and oxytocin release within the brain: a dynamic concept of multiple and variable modes of neuropeptide communication |journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology |volume=25 |issue=3–4 |pages=150–76 |year=2004 |pmid=15589267 |doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2004.05.001}}</ref> Depending on the species, oxytocin receptor-expressing cells are located in other areas, including the [[amygdala]] and [[Bed_nucleus_of_the_stria_terminalis|bed nucleus]] of the [[stria terminalis]].

In the [[pituitary gland]], oxytocin is packaged in large, dense-core vesicles, where it is bound to [[neurophysin I]] as shown in the inset of the figure; neurophysin is a large [[peptide]] fragment of the larger precursor [[protein]] molecule from which oxytocin is derived by [[enzyme|enzymatic]] cleavage.

Secretion of oxytocin from the neurosecretory nerve endings is regulated by the electrical activity of the oxytocin cells in the hypothalamus. These cells generate [[action potential]]s that propagate down [[axon]]s to the nerve endings in the pituitary; the endings contain large numbers of oxytocin-containing vesicles, which are released by [[exocytosis]] when the nerve terminals are depolarised.

====Female====
Oxytocin is synthesized by [[corpora lutea]] of several species, including ruminants and primates. Along with estrogen, it is involved in inducing the endometrial synthesis of [[prostaglandin F2alpha|prostaglandin&nbsp;F<sub>2α</sub>]] to cause regression of the corpus luteum.

====Male====
The [[Leydig cells]] in some species have also been shown to possess the biosynthetic machinery to manufacture testicular oxytocin ''de novo'', to be specific, in rats (which can synthesize vitamin C endogenously), and in guinea pigs, which, like humans, require an exogenous source of vitamin C (ascorbate) in their diets.<ref name="pmid1456839">{{Cite journal| author = Kukucka Mark A, Misra Hara P | title = HPLC determination of an oxytocin-like peptide produced by isolated guinea pig Leydig cells: stimulation by ascorbate | journal = Arch.

==Oxytocin receptor polymorphism==
The [[oxytocin receptor]] in humans has several [[allele]]s, which differ in their effectiveness. For example, at one particular marker, individuals [[homozygous]] for the "G" allele, when compared to carriers of the "A" allele, show higher empathy and lower stress response,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Rodrigues SM, Saslow LR, Garcia N, John OP, Keltner D |title=Oxytocin receptor genetic variation relates to empathy and stress reactivity in humans |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=106 |issue=50 |pages=21437–41 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=19934046 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0909579106 |pmc=2795557}}</ref> as well as lower prevalence of [[autism]] and of poor parenting skills.<ref>{{Cite news | author = Angier N | title = The Biology Behind the Milk of Human Kindness | work = The New York Times | date = 2009-11-24 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/24/science/24angier.html }}</ref>

==Evolution==
Virtually all [[vertebrate]]s have an oxytocin-like [[nonapeptide]] hormone that supports reproductive functions and a vasopressin-like nonapeptide hormone involved in water regulation. The two genes are usually located close to each other (less than 15,000 bases apart) on the same [[chromosome]], and are transcribed in opposite directions (however, in [[fugu]],<ref name="pmid9356472">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.94.23.12462 |author=Venkatesh B, Si-Hoe SL, Murphy D, Brenner S |title=Transgenic rats reveal functional conservation of regulatory controls between the Fugu isotocin and rat oxytocin genes |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=94 |issue=23 |pages=12462–6 |year=1997 |month=November |pmid=9356472 |pmc=25001 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9356472}}</ref> the homologs are further apart and transcribed in the same direction).

The two genes are believed to result from a [[gene duplication]] event; the ancestral gene is estimated to be about 500 million years old and is found in [[cyclostomata]] (modern members of the [[Agnatha]]).<ref name="Gimpl" />
