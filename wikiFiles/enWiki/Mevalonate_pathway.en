[[Image:Mevalonate_pathway.svg|thumb|350px|right|Mevalonate pathway]]
The '''mevalonate pathway''' or '''HMG-CoA reductase  pathway''' or '''mevalonate-dependent (MAD) route''' or '''isoprenoid pathway''', is an important [[cell (biology)|cellular]] [[metabolic pathway]] present in all higher eukaryotes and many bacteria. It is important for the production of [[dimethylallyl pyrophosphate]] (DMAPP) and [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] (IPP), which serve as the basis for the biosynthesis of molecules used in processes as diverse as [[terpenoid]] synthesis, protein [[prenylation]], [[cell membrane]] maintenance, [[hormone]]s, [[lipid anchored protein|protein anchoring]], and [[glycosylation|''N''-glycosylation]]. It is also a part of [[steroid biosynthesis]].

==Regulation and feedback==
Several key enzymes can be activated through [[DNA transcription]]al regulation on activation of [[SREBP]] (sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 and -2). This intracellular sensor detects low [[cholesterol]] levels and stimulates endogenous production by the HMG-CoA reductase pathway, as well as increasing lipoprotein uptake by up-regulating the [[LDL receptor|LDL-receptor]]. Regulation of this pathway is also achieved by controlling the rate of translation of the mRNA, degradation of reductase and phosphorylation.

==Pharmacology==
A number of [[medication|drugs]] target the ''mevalonate pathway'':
* [[Statin]]s (used to [[hypercholesterolemia|decrease cholesterol levels]]);
* [[Bisphosphonate]]s (used to treat various bone-degenerative diseases)

==Alternative==
[[Plant]]s and [[apicomplexa]]n [[protozoa]] such as [[malaria]] parasites have the ability to produce their [[isoprenoids]] ([[terpenoids]]) using an additional alternative pathway called the [[methylerythritol phosphate]] (MEP) or [[non-mevalonate pathway]], which takes place in their [[plastid]]s. In addition, most [[bacteria]] including important pathogens, such as ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', synthesize IPP and DMAPP via the [[non-mevalonate pathway]] instead.

 |- 
 | [[Acetyl-CoA]] ([[citric acid cycle]]) undergoes condensation with another acetyl-CoA subunit via Acetyl-CoA Transferase to form [[acetoacetyl-CoA]] ||  || [[thiolase]]

 |- 
 | HMG-CoA is reduced to [[mevalonate]] by [[NADPH]]. This reaction occurs in the cytosol. It is the rate limiting step in cholesterol synthesis, which is why the enzyme catalyzing the reaction is a target of [[statin]]s. || [[Image:HMG-CoA reductase reaction.svg|center|400px]] || [[HMG-CoA reductase]]
