'''1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane''', '''R-134a''', '''Forane 134a''', '''Genetron 134a''', '''Suva 134a''' or '''HFC-134a''', is a [[haloalkane]] [[refrigerant]] with thermodynamic properties similar to [[dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]] (dichlorodifluoromethane), but with less [[ozone depletion potential]]. It has the formula CH<sub>2</sub>FCF<sub>3</sub>, and a [[boiling point]] of −26.3 °C (−15.34 °F) at atmospheric pressure.

==Uses==
1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane is an inert gas used primarily as a “high-temperature” refrigerant for domestic refrigeration and automobile air conditioners. These devices began using 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane in the early 1990s as a replacement for the more environmentally harmful [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]], and retrofit kits are available to convert units that were originally [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]]-equipped. Other uses include plastic foam blowing, as a cleaning solvent, a propellant for the delivery of pharmaceuticals (e.g. [[bronchodilator]]s), wine cork removers, [[gas duster]]s, and in air driers for removing the moisture from [[compressed air]]. 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane has also been used to cool computers in some [[overclocking]] attempts. It is also commonly used as a propellant for [[airsoft]] airguns.
[[Image:Tetrafluoroethane liquid.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tetrafluoroethane, when compressed as inside gas duster cans, is a clear liquid which boils when exposed to atmospheric pressure at room temperature (as seen here) and can be extracted from common [[Gas duster|"canned air"]] canisters by simply inverting them during use.]]

==History==
1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane first appeared in the early 1990s as a replacement for [[dichlorodifluoromethane]] (R-12), which has ozone depleting properties.<ref>{{cite journal| author= Franklin J  |title=The Atmospheric Degradation and Impact of 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluorethane (Hydrofluorocarbon 134a)|journal=Chemosphere |year=1993|pages=1565–1601|volume=27|doi=10.1016/0045-6535(93)90251-Y| issue= 8}}</ref> 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane has been atmospherically modeled for its impact on depleting ozone and as a contributor to global warming.

==Safety==
Contact of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane with flames or hot surfaces in excess of 250 °C (482 °F) may cause vapor [[decomposition]] and the emission of [[toxin|toxic]] gases including [[hydrogen fluoride]] and [[Carbonyl fluoride|carbonyl halides]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=[[Honeywell International]]  | title=MSDS # GTRN-0047 For Genetron 134aUV | month= December | year= 2005 }}</ref> 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane itself has an [[Lethal dose|LD<sub>50</sub>]] (lethal concentration for 50% of subjects) in rats of 1,500 g/m³, making it relatively non-toxic, apart from the dangers inherent to [[inhalant abuse]]. <!-- However, its gaseous form is denser than air, and will displace air in the lungs.

Aerosol cans containing 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, when inverted, become effective freeze sprays. Under pressure, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane is compressed into a liquid, which upon vaporization absorbs a significant amount of [[thermal energy]]. As a result, it will greatly lower the temperature of any object it contacts as it evaporates. This can result in [[frostbite]] when it contacts skin, as well as blindness upon eye contact.
