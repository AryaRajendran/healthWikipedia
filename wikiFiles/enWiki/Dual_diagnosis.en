'''Dual diagnosis''' (also called '''co-occurring disorders''', COD)<ref>{{cite web |title=Report to Congress on the prevention and treatment of co-occurring substance abuse disorders and mental disorders |publisher=[[SAMHSA]] |url=http://www.samhsa.gov/reports/congress2002/chap1ucod.htm |date=November 2001 |accessdate=May 1, 2012}}</ref> is the  condition of suffering from a [[mental illness]] and a [[comorbid]] [[substance abuse]] problem.  There is considerable debate surrounding the appropriateness using a single category for a [[heterogeneous]] group of individuals with complex needs and a varied range of problems. The concept can be used broadly, for example depression and alcoholism, or it can be restricted to specify severe mental illness (e.g. [[psychosis]], [[schizophrenia]]) and substance misuse disorder (e.g. [[cannabis abuse]]), or a person who has a milder mental illness and a drug dependency, such as [[panic disorder]] or [[generalized anxiety disorder]] and is [[opioid dependency|dependent on opioids]].  Diagnosing a primary psychiatric illness in substance abusers is challenging as drug abuse itself often induces psychiatric symptoms, thus making it necessary to differentiate between substance induced and pre-existing mental illness.

Those with co-occurring disorders face complex challenges.  They have increased rates of relapse, hospitalization, [[homelessness]], and [[HIV]] and [[Hepatitis C]] infection compared to those with either mental or substance use disorders alone.<ref name=senate>{{cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/SEN/Committe/391/soci/rep/pdf/rep02may06part1-e.pdf |title=Out of the Shadows at Last: Transforming Mental Health, Mental Illness and Addictions Services in Canada |author=Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science, and Technology |year=2006 |publisher= Government of Canada |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}</ref>  The cause of co-occurring disorders is unknown, although there are several theories.

==Differentiating pre-existing and substance induced==
Drug abuse, including alcohol and prescription drugs, can induce symptomatology which resembles mental illness, which can make it difficult to differentiate between substance induced psychiatric syndromes and pre-existing mental health problems. More often than not psychiatric disorders among drug or alcohol abusers disappear with prolonged abstinence. Substance induced psychiatric symptoms can occur both in the intoxicated state and also during the [[withdrawal]] state. In some cases these substance induced psychiatric disorders can persist long after detoxification, such as prolonged psychosis or [[major depression|depression]] after amphetamine or cocaine abuse. Abuse of [[hallucinogens]] can trigger delusional and other psychotic phenomena long after cessation of use and [[cannabis]] may trigger panic attacks during intoxication and with use it may cause a state similar to [[dysthymia]]. Severe anxiety and depression are commonly induced by sustained alcohol abuse which in most cases abates with prolonged abstinence. Even moderate sustained use of alcohol may increase anxiety and depression levels in some individuals. In most cases these drug induced psychiatric disorders fade away with prolonged abstinence. A [[protracted withdrawal syndrome]] can also occur with psychiatric and other symptoms persisting for months after cessation of use. [[Benzodiazepines]] are the most notable drug for inducing prolonged withdrawal effects with symptoms sometimes persisting for years after cessation of use.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Katie |last2=Sullivan |first2=Michael J. |title=Dual Diagnosis: Counseling the Mentally Ill Substance Abuser |url=http://books.google.com/?id=lvUzR0obihEC |edition=2nd |date=1 March 2001 |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-57230-446-8 |pages=75–76}}</ref>

==Prevalence==
The 2011 USA National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that 17.5% of adults with a mental illness had a co-occurring substance use disorder; this works out to 7.98 million people.<ref name="SAMHSA 2012"/>  Estimates of co-occurring disorders in Canada are even higher, with an estimated 40-60% of adults with a severe and persistent mental illness experiencing a substance use disorder in their lifetime.<ref name="Health Canada">{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hc-ps/alt_formats/hecs-sesc/pdf/pubs/adp-apd/bp_disorder-mp_concomitants/bp_concurrent_mental_health-eng.pdf |title=Best Practices: Concurrent Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders |author=Health Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |year=2012 |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}</ref>

A study by Kessler et al. in the United States attempting to assess the [[prevalence]] of dual diagnosis found that 47% of clients with schizophrenia had a substance misuse disorder at some time in their life, and the chances of developing a substance misuse disorder was significantly higher among patients suffering from a psychotic illness than in the those without a psychotic illness.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kessler RC |coauthors=McGonagle KA, Zhao S, Nelson CB, Hughes M, Eshleman S, Wittchen HU, Kendler KS |year=1994 |title=Lifetime and 12-month prevalence of DSM-III-R psychiatric disorders in the United States.

Another study looked at the extent of substance misuse in a group of 187 chronically mentally ill patients living in the community. According to the clinician's ratings, around a third of the sample used [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[street drug]]s, or both during the six months before evaluation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Drake RE |coauthors=Wallach MA |year=1993 |title=Moderate drinking among people with severe mental illness |journal=Hospital & Community Psychiatry |volume=44 |issue=8 |pages=780–2 |pmid=8375841}}</ref>

Further UK studies have shown slightly more moderate rates of substance misuse among mentally ill individuals. One study found that individuals suffering from schizophrenia showed just a 7% prevalence of problematic drug use in the year prior to being interviewed and 21% reported problematic use some time before that.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cantwell, R |coauthors=[[Scotland|Scottish]] Comorbidity Study Group |year=2003 |title=Substance use and schizophrenia: effects on symptoms, social functioning and service use |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=182 |issue=4 |pages=324–9 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/182/4/324 |pmid=12668408 |accessdate=26 February 2008 |doi= 10.1192/bjp.182.4.324}}</ref> 

Wright and colleagues identified individuals with psychotic illnesses who had been in contact with services in the London borough of [[Croydon]] over the previous 6 months. Cases of alcohol or substance misuse and dependence were identified through [[structured interview|standardized interviews]] with clients and keyworkers. Results showed that prevalence rates of dual diagnosis were 33% for the use of any substance, 20% for alcohol misuse only and 5% for drug misuse only.{{clarify|reason=Is this current use at the time of the study?|date=April 2013}} A lifetime history of any illicit drug use was observed in 35% of the sample.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wright S |coauthors=Gournay K, Glorney E, Thornicroft G |year=2000 |title=Dual diagnosis in the suburbs: prevalence, need, and in-patient service use |journal=[[Social Psychiatry & Psychiatric Epidemiology]] |volume=35 |issue=7 |pages=297–304 |pmid=11016524 |doi=10.1007/s001270050242}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Substance use disorders can be confused with other psychiatric disorders. There are diagnoses for substance-induced mood disorders and substance-induced anxiety disorders and thus such overlap can be complicated. For this reason, the [[DSM-IV]] advises that diagnoses of primary [[psychiatric]] disorders not be made in the absence of [[sobriety]] (of duration sufficient to allow for any substance-induced [[Post-acute-withdrawal syndrome|post-acute-withdrawal]] symptoms to dissipate) up to 1 year.

==Treatment==
Only a small proportion of those with co-occurring disorders actually receive treatment for both disorders.  In 2011, it was estimated that only 12.4% of American adults with co-occurring disorders were receiving both mental health and addictions treatment.<ref name="SAMHSA 2012">{{cite web |url=http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k11MH_FindingsandDetTables/2K11MHFR/NSDUHmhfr2011.htm |title=Results from the 2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Mental Health Findings |author=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |year=2012 |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}</ref>  Clients with co-occurring disorders face challenges accessing treatment, as they may be excluded from mental health services if they admit to a substance abuse problem, and vice versa.<ref name=senate/>

There are multiple approaches to treating concurrent disorders.  Partial treatment involves treating only the disorder that is considered primary.  Sequential treatment involves treating the primary disorder first, and then treating the secondary disorder after the primary disorder has been stabilized.  Parallel treatment involves the client receiving mental health services from one provider, and addictions services from another.<ref name=senate/>

Integrated treatment involves a seamless blending of interventions into a single coherent treatment package developed with a consistent philosophy and approach among care providers.<ref name=Drake>{{cite journal |author=Drake RE Mueser KT Brunette MR McHugo GJ |year=2004 |title=A Review of Treatments for People with Severe Mental Illness and Co-Occurring Substance Use Disorders |journal=Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=360–374}}</ref>  With this approach, both disorders are considered primary.<ref name="SAMHSA COCE">{{cite web |url=http://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content//PHD1132/PHD1132.pdf |title=Overarching Principles to Address the Needs of Persons with Co-Occcurring Disorders |author=Center for Co-Occurring Disorders |year=2006 |publisher= Substance and Mental Health Services Administration |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}</ref>  Integrated treatment can improve accessibility, service individualization, engagement in treatment, treatment compliance, mental health symptoms, and overall outcomes.<ref name=APA>{{cite web |url=http://psychiatryonline.org/content.aspx?bookid=28&sectionid=1675010 |title=Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Patients with Substance Use Disorders, 2nd ed |author=American Psychiatric Association |year=2006 |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}</ref><ref name=Rush>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccsa.ca/ceca/pdf/Main-reportFINALa.pdf |title=On the Intregation of Mental Health and Substance Use Services and Systems: Main Report |author=Rush B Fobb B Nadeau L Furlong A |year=2008 |publisher=Canadian Executive Council on Addictions |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}</ref>  The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in the United States describes integrated treatment as being in the best interests or clients, programs, funders, and systems.<ref name="SAMHSA COCE"/>  Green suggested that treatment should be integrated, and a collaborative process between the treatment team and the patient.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Green MD |title=Development of a Dual Disorders Program Methodology for Better Outcomes |journal=Psychiatric Times |date=19 March 2009 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/paranoia/article/10168/1390341}}</ref> Furthermore, recovery should to be viewed as a marathon rather than a sprint, and methods and outcome goals should be explicit. 

Although many patients may reject medications as antithetical to substance-abuse recovery and side effects, they can be useful to reduce paranoia, anxiety, and craving.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Medications that have proven effective include opioid replacement therapies, such as lifelong maintenance on methadone or buprenorphine, to minimize risk of relapse, fatality, and legal trouble amongst opioid addicts, as well as helping with cravings, [[baclofen]] for alcoholics, opioid addicts, cocaine addicts, and amphetamine addicts, to help eliminate drug cravings, and [[clozapine]], the first atypical [[antipsychotic]], which appears to reduce illicit drug use amongst stimulant addicts. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Clozapine can cause respiratory arrest when combined with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or opioids, so it is not recommended to use in these groups.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Theories of dual diagnosis==
There are a number of theories that explain the relationship between mental illness and substance abuse.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mueser KT |coauthors=Essock SM, Drake RE, Wolfe RS, Frisman L |year=2001 |title=Rural and urban differences in patients with a dual diagnosis |journal=[[Schizophrenia Research]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=93–107 |pmid= 11278157 |doi=10.1016/S0920-9964(00)00065-7}}</ref>

===Causality===
The causality theory suggests that certain types of substance abuse may causally lead to mental illness. 

There is strong evidence that using [[cannabis]] can produce temporary and usually mild [[psychosis|psychotic]] and [[mood disorder|affective experiences]].<ref name = Moore>{{cite journal |author=Moore TH |coauthors=Zammit S, Lingford-Hughes A, Barnes TR, Jones PB, Burke M, Lewis G |year=2007 |title=Cannabis use and risk of psychotic or affective mental health outcomes: a systematic review |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=370 |issue=9584 |pages=319–28 |url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/psychiatry/staff/zammit/documents/paper.pdf |pmid=17662880 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61162-3}}</ref> When it comes to persisting effects, there is a clear increase in incidence of psychotic outcomes in people who had used cannabis, even when they had used it only once. More frequent use of cannabis strongly augmented the risk for psychosis. The evidence for affective outcomes is less strong.<ref name = Moore/> However, this connection between cannabis and psychosis does not prove that cannabis ''causes'' psychotic disorders.<ref name = Moore/> The causality theory for cannabis has been challenged as despite explosive increases in cannabis consumption over the past 40 years in western society, the rate of schizophrenia (and psychosis in general) has remained relatively stable.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Degenhardt L, Hall W, Lynskey M |title=Comorbidity between cannabis use and psychosis: Modelling some possible relationships.| version = Technical Report No. 121. |publisher=Sydney: National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre.|year=2001 |url=http://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/NDARCWeb.nsf/resources/TR_18/$file/TR.121.PDF|format=[[PDF]]|accessdate=19 August 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Martin Frisher, Ilana Crome, Orsolina Martino, and Peter Croft. |year=2009 |title= Assessing the impact of cannabis use on trends in diagnosed schizophrenia in the United Kingdom from 1996 to 2005 |journal=Schizophrenia Research |volume=113 |issue=2–3 |pages=123–128 |url=http://www.ukcia.org/research/keele_study/Assessing-the-impact-of-cannabis-use-on-trend-in-diagnosed-schizophrenia.pdf |pmid=19560900 |doi=10.1016/j.schres.2009.05.031}}</ref><ref>http://www.nhsconfed.org/Publications/Documents/MHN_factsheet_August_2009_FINAL_2.pdf Key facts and trends in mental health, National Health Service, 2009</ref>

===Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder===
One in four people who have a substance use disorder also have [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]],<ref name="van Emmerik-van Oortmerssen-2012">{{Cite journal  | last1 = van Emmerik-van Oortmerssen | first1 = K. | last2 = van de Glind | first2 = G. | last3 = van den Brink | first3 = W. | last4 = Smit | first4 = F. | last5 = Crunelle | first5 = CL. | last6 = Swets | first6 = M. | last7 = Schoevers | first7 = RA. | title = Prevalence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in substance use disorder patients: a meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis. | journal = Drug Alcohol Depend | volume = 122 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 11–9 | month = Apr | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2011.12.007 | PMID = 22209385 }}</ref> which makes the treatment of both conditions more difficult.

Psychosocial therapy and/or nonstimulant medications and extended release stimulants are ADHD treatment options that reduce these risks.<ref name="Upadhyaya-2007"/>

===Past exposure to psychiatric medications theory===
The past exposure theory suggests that [[Exposure to toxins|exposure]] to psychiatric medication alters neural [[synapses]], introducing an [[:wikt:imbalance|imbalance]] that was not previously present.  Discontinuation of the drug is expected to result in symptoms of psychiatric illness which resolve once the drug is restarted.<ref name="robertwhitaker.org">http://robertwhitaker.org/robertwhitaker.org/Anatomy%20of%20an%20Epidemic.html</ref> This theory suggests that while it may appear that the medication is working, it is only treating a disorder caused by the medication itself.<ref name="robertwhitaker.org"/> New exposure to psychiatric medication may lead to heightened sensitivity to the effects of drugs and alcohol, which has a deteriorating effect on the patient.<ref>http://knowledgeisnecessity.blogspot.com/2010/11/supersensitivity-psychosis-evidence.html</ref><ref>http://www.ahrp.org/risks/biblio0100.php</ref><ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0447.1990.tb05477.x/abstract</ref><ref>http://breggin.com/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=232&Itemid=37</ref>

===Self-medication theory===
The [[self-medication]] theory suggests that people with severe mental illnesses misuse substances in order to relieve a specific set of symptoms and counter the negative side-effects of [[antipsychotic|antipsychotic medication]].<ref name=Khantzian>{{cite journal |author=Khantzian EJ |year=1997 |title=The self-medication hypothesis of substance use disorders: a reconsideration and recent applications |journal=Harv Rev Psychiatry |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=231–44 |pmid=9385000 |doi=10.3109/10673229709030550}}</ref>

Khantizan proposes that substances are not randomly chosen, but are specifically selected for their effects. For example, using stimulants such as [[nicotine]] or [[amphetamine]]s can be used to combat the [[sedation]] that can be caused by higher doses of certain types of (usually [[typical antipsychotic|typical]]) antipsychotic medication.<ref name=Khantzian/> Conversely, some people taking medications with a [[stimulant]] effect such as the [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|SNRI]] antidepressants Effexor ([[venlafaxine]]) or Wellbutrin ([[bupropion]]) may seek out [[benzodiazepines]] or [[opioid]] [[narcotics]] to counter the [[anxiety]] and [[insomnia]] that such medications sometimes evoke. 

Some studies show that nicotine administration can be effective for reducing motor side-effects of antipsychotics, with both [[bradykinesia]]<ref name=pmid12377405>{{cite journal |author=Yang YK, Nelson L, Kamaraju L, Wilson W, McEvoy JP |title=Nicotine decreases bradykinesia-rigidity in haloperidol-treated patients with schizophrenia |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=684–6 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12377405 |doi=10.1016/S0893-133X(02)00325-1}}</ref> (stiff muscles) and [[dyskinesia]]<ref name=pmid15008806>{{cite journal |author=Silvestri S, Negrete JC, Seeman MV, Shammi CM, Seeman P |title=Does nicotine affect D2 receptor upregulation?

===Alleviation of dysphoria theory===
The alleviation of [[dysphoria]] theory suggests that people with severe mental illness commonly have a negative [[self-image]], which makes them vulnerable to using [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive substances]] to alleviate these feelings. Despite the existence of a wide range of dysphoric feelings ([[anxiety]], depression, [[boredom]], and [[loneliness]]), the literature on self-reported reasons for use seems to lend support for the experience of these feelings being the primary motivator for drug and alcohol misuse.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pristach CA |coauthors=Smith CM |year=1996 |title=Self-reported effects of alcohol use on symptoms of schizophrenia |journal=Psychiatr Serv |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=421–3 |pmid=8689377}}</ref>

===Multiple risk factor theory===
Another theory is that there may be shared risk factors that can lead to both substance abuse and mental illness. Mueser hypothesizes that these may include factors such as [[social isolation]], poverty, lack of structured daily activity, lack of adult role responsibility, living in areas with high drug availability, and association with people who already misuse drugs.<ref>Anthony, J.C. & Helzer, J.E. 1991, "Syndromes of drug abuse and dependence", in Psychiatric Disorders in America: The Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study, L.N. Robins & D.A. Regier, eds., Free Press, New York, pp. 116–154.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Berman, S |coauthors=Noble, EP |year=1993 |title=Childhood antecedents of substance misuse |journal=[[Current Opinion in Psychiatry]] |volume=6 |pages=382–7 |doi=10.1097/00001504-199306000-00012 |issue=3}}</ref>

Other evidence suggests that [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] life events such as sexual [[abuse]], are associated with the development of psychiatric problems and substance abuse.<ref>Banerjee, S., Clancy, C., & Crome, I. 2002, "Co-existing Problems of Mental Disorder and Substance Misuse (dual diagnosis). An Information Manual. Found at http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk", Royal College of Psychiatrists' Research Unit.</ref>

===The supersensitivity theory===
The supersensitivity theory<ref name=mueser_AB>{{cite journal |author=Mueser KT |coauthors=Drake RE, Wallach MA |year=1998 |title=Dual diagnosis: a review of etiological theories |journal=[[Addictive Behaviors]] |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=717–34 |pmid=9801712 |doi=10.1016/S0306-4603(98)00073-2}}</ref> proposes that certain individuals who have severe mental illness also have biological and psychological vulnerabilities, caused by genetic and early [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] life events.  These interact with stressful life events and can result in either a psychiatric disorder or trigger a relapse into an existing illness. The theory states that although anti-psychotic medication can reduce the vulnerability, substance abuse may increase it, causing the individual to be more likely to experience negative consequences from using relatively small amounts of substances.  These individuals, therefore, are "supersensitive" to the effects of certain substances, and individuals with psychotic illness such as schizophrenia may be less capable of sustaining moderate substance use over time without experiencing negative symptoms. 

Although there are limitations in the research studies conducted in this area, namely that most have focused primarily on schizophrenia, this theory provides an explanation of why relatively low levels of substance misuse often result in negative consequences for individuals with severe mental illness.<ref name=mueser_AB/>
