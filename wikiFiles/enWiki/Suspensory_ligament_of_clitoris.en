The '''suspensory ligament of the clitoris''' is a fibrous band at the deep fascial level that extends from the [[pubic symphysis]] to the deep fascia of the [[clitoris]], anchoring the clitoris to the pubic symphysis. <ref>{{cite book |title=[[Stedman's Medical Dictionary]] |chapter=Suspensory ligament of clitoris |editor-last=Lathrop Stedman |editor-first=Thomas |edition=28th |year=2006 |publisher=[[Lippincott Williams & Wilkins]] |location=[[Philadelphia]] |isbn=978-0781764506 |oclc=61162300 |page= |pages= |accessdate=September 25, 2012 |chapterurl=http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=49781}}</ref> By virtue of this connection, the pubic symphysis supports the clitoris.

The suspensory ligament of clitoris consistently displayed two components: a superficial fibro-fatty structure extending from a broad base within the mons pubis to converge on the body of the clitoris and extending into the [[labia majora]]: in addition there is a deep component with a narrow origin on the symphysis pubis extending to the body and the bulbs of the clitoris.<ref>{{PubMed|11111889}}</ref>

Its form and position differs from those of the [[suspensory ligament of the penis]].
During [[sexual arousal]], the ligament shortens and swells. This pulls the clitoral shaft in such a way that the [[clitoral glans]] appears to retract beneath the [[clitoral hood]].
