'''Lobar pneumonia''' is a form of [[pneumonia]] that affects a large and continuous area of the lobe of a lung.<ref name="isbn0-7216-0187-1">{{cite book |author=Cotran, Ramzi S.; Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelson; Nelso Fausto; Robbins, Stanley L.; Abbas, Abul K. |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005 |isbn=0-7216-0187-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page=749}}</ref>

It is one of the two anatomic classifications of pneumonia (the other being [[bronchopneumonia]]).

== Stages ==

Lobar pneumonia usually has an acute progression.
Classically, the disease has four stages:

* [[Pulmonary edema|Congestion]] in the first 24 hours: This stage is characterized histologically by vascular engorgement, intra-alveolar fluid, small numbers of neutrophils, often numerous [[bacteria]]. Grossly, the [[lung]] is heavy and hyperemic
* [[Hepatization of lungs|Red hepatization]] or [[Pulmonary consolidation|consolidation]] : Vascular congestion persists, with extravasation of red cells into alveolar spaces, along with increased numbers of [[neutrophil]]s and [[fibrin]]. The filling of airspaces by the exudate leads to a gross appearance of solidification, or consolidation, of the alveolar [[parenchyma]]. This appearance has been likened to that of the [[liver]], hence the term "hepatization".
* [[Hepatization of lungs|Grey hepatization]] : Red cells disintegrate, with persistence of the neutrophils and fibrin. The alveoli still appear consolidated, but grossly the color is paler and the cut surface is drier.
* Resolution (complete recovery):The exudate is digested by enzymatic activity, and cleared by [[macrophage]]s or by cough mechanism.

==  Diagnosis ==

The most common organisms which cause lobar pneumonia are ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', also called pneumococcus, ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' and ''[[Moraxella catarrhalis]]''. ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', the tubercle bacillus, may also cause lobar pneumonia if pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] is not treated promptly.

The identification of the infectious organism (or other cause) is an important part of modern treatment of pneumonia. The anatomical patterns of distribution can be associated with certain organisms,<ref name="urlLobar Pneumonia">{{cite web |url=http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/medicine/PULMONAR/cxr/atlas/pneumonia.htm |title=Lobar Pneumonia |work= |accessdate=2008-11-16}}</ref> and can help in selection of an antibiotic while waiting for the pathogen to be cultured.
