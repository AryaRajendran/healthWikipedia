An '''abortifacient''' (Latin: that which will cause a [[miscarriage]]) is a substance that induces [[abortion]]. Abortifacients for [[animal]]s that have [[mating|mated]] undesirably are known as ''mismating shots''.

Common abortifacients used in performing [[medical abortion]]s include [[mifepristone]], which is typically used in conjunction with [[misoprostol]] in a two-step approach.<ref>

[[Mifepristone]] is a [[progesterone receptor antagonist]] also known as RU-486. It is marketed under the trade name Mifegyne in France and countries other than the U.S., and under the trade name Mifeprex in the U.S. It is used in conjunction with a prostaglandin analogue.

Misoprostol alone is sometimes used for [[self-induced abortion]] in [[Latin America]]n countries where legal abortion is not available, and by some people in the [[United States]] who cannot afford a legal [[abortion]].<ref>[[John Leland (journalist)|John Leland]]: "[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/02/weekinreview/02leland.html Abortion Might Outgrow Its Need for Roe v.

==Natural abortifacients==

Numerous non-pharmaceutial abortifacients existed during the pre-pharmaceutical era. These included herbal, mineral, and ritualistic or spiritual preparations. The effectiveness thereof is difficult to determine, as almost all such uses occurred before the days of [[clinical trials]] and the [[scientific method]]. Of those that remain in use in the modern day, some are considered effective to a lesser or greater degree; while others are very effective, but carry negative side effects (primarily toxicity) which keep them from wider prevalence.

Today, many herbs and plants sold "[[over-the-counter drug|over the counter]]" are claimed to act as abortifacients, either by themselves or if taken in certain doses or mixtures.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Examples include [[brewer's yeast]],<ref>''[[King's American Dispensatory]]'' of 1898</ref> [[vitamin C]], [[bitter melon]],<ref>''A Woman's Book of Choices: Abortion, Menstrual Extraction, RU-486'' by Rebecca Chalker and Carol Downer</ref> [[wild carrot]], [[blue cohosh]], [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]], [[nutmeg]], [[mugwort]], [[slippery elm]], [[papaya]], [[vervain]], [[Rue|common rue]], [[ergot]], [[saffron]] and [[tansy]].  [[Animal studies]] have shown that [[pomegranate]] may be an effective abortifacient.<ref name="riddle1">Riddle, John M. (1992).

== History ==
In the Bible, an ordeal is prescribed for a [[Sotah|woman suspected of adultery]] in which she drinks "water of bitterness," which can be interpreted to result, if she is guilty, in the abortion or miscarriage of a pregnancy she may be carrying.<ref>{{Cite book |work=The God of Israel |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=128 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZrGfxNqfszsC&pg=PA128 |first=R.P. |last=Gordon |year=2007}}</ref>

[[Image:Silphium.jpg|frame|right|Ancient silver coin from [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] depicting a stalk of [[Silphium]].]]
The ancient [[ancient Greece|Greek]] colony of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] at one time had an economy based almost entirely on the production and export of the plant [[silphium]], considered a powerful abortifacient.<ref name="devilsdung">Chip Rossetti, [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200904/devil.s.dung-the.world.s.smelliest.spice.htm Devil’s Dung - The World’s Smelliest Spice], Saudi Armaco World, 2009</ref>  Silphium figured so prominently in the wealth of Cyrene that the plant appeared on [[coin]]s minted there.  Silphium, which was native only to that part of [[Libya]], was [[overharvested]] by the [[Greece|Greeks]] and was effectively driven to extinction.<ref name="devilsdung" /> The standard theory, however, has been challenged by a whole spectrum of alternatives (from an extinction due to climate factors, to the so-coveted product being in fact a recipe made of a composite of herbs, attribution to a single species meant perhaps as a [[disinformation]] attempt).

In aboriginal Australia, plants such as [[cymbidium madidum]], [[petalostigma pubescens]], [[Eucalyptus gamophylla]] were ingested or the body/vagina was smoked with [[Erythropleum chlorostachyum]].<ref>Bush food: Aboriginal food and herbal medicine by Jennifer Isaacs</ref>

As [[Christianity]] and in particular the institution of the [[Catholic]] Church increasingly influenced European society, those who dispensed abortifacient herbs found themselves classified as [[witch]]es and were often persecuted (see [[witch-hunt]]).<ref name="malleus">Kramer, Heinrich, & Sprenger, Jacob.

[[Medicine in medieval Islam|Medieval Muslim physicians]] documented detailed and extensive lists of [[birth control]] practices, including the use of abortifacients, commenting on their effectiveness and prevalence. The use of abortifacients was acceptable to [[Ulema|Islamic jurists]] provided that the abortion occurs within 120 days, the point when the fetus is considered to become fully human and receive its soul.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sheikh|first=Sa'diyya|contribution=Family Planning, Contraception, and Abortion in Islam|editor-first=Daniel C.|editor-last=Maguire|title=Sacred Rights: The Case for Contraception and Abortion in World Religions|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] US|year=2003|isbn=0-19-516001-0|pages=105–128 [105–6]}}</ref>

In English law, abortion did not become illegal until 1803.  English folk practice before and after that time held that fetal life was not present until [[quickening]]. "Women who took drugs before that time would describe their actions as 'restoring the menses' or 'bringing on a period'."<ref>{{Cite book|last=McLaren|first=Angus|title=Birth Control in Nineteenth-Century England|publisher=[[Holmes & Meier Publishers, Inc.]] US|year=1978|isbn=0-8419-0349-2|pages=31, 246}}</ref> Abortifacients used by women in England in the 19th century (not necessarily safe or effective) included [[diachylon]], [[Juniperus sabina|savin]], [[ergot]] of rye, [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]], [[slippery elm]], [[nutmeg]], [[rue]], [[Drimia maritima|squills]], and [[hiera picra]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(01)40125-5 | title = The Annus Medicus 1899 | year = 1899 | journal = The Lancet | volume = 154 | issue = 3983 | pages = 1819–49 [1844–5] }}, cited by McLaren, p. 241</ref>
