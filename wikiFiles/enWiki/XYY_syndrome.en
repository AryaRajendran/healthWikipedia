'''XYY syndrome''' is an [[aneuploidy]] (abnormal number) of the [[sex chromosome]]s in which a [[human]] [[male]] receives an extra [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]], giving a total of 47 chromosomes instead of the more usual 46. This produces a '''47,XYY''' [[karyotype]], which occurs in 1 in 1,000 male births.

It has generally been observed that reproductive risks for males with 47,XYY are no higher than for euploid males, despite the fact that ''in situ'' hybridization studies demonstrated a lower frequency of single Y-bearing sperm than expected and a variably higher rate of disomic XX, XY and YY spermatozoa in males with 47,XYY.<br/>Population-based studies have demonstrated that intellectual abilities tend to be slightly lower than those of siblings and matched controls and that boys with an extra Y chromosome are more likely to require educational help.

However, FISH analyses of sperm, enabling hundreds of cells to be analyzed, have shown a very small increased faction of 24,YY spermatozoa in the ejaculate of XYY men (Table 12-1). Thus it appears the vast majority of spermatocytes lose the extra Y before entering meiosis, a very few XYY primary spermatocytes are able to slip through and produce YY (and XY) spermatozoa. These cytogenetic findings parallel the observation that XYY men have no ''discernible'' increase in risk to have children with a sex chromosome abnormality. A true increased risk of a fraction of a per cent could be distinguished only with the greatest of difficulty when the background population risk is of a similar order of magnitude. As for the autosomes, no convincing case exists for any increased risk for aneuploidy in the children of men with 47,XYY.<br/>To our knowledge, there is no report of a discernibly increased risk for the XYY male to have chromosomally abnormal children.

==Cause==
[[File:XYY syndrome.svg|thumb|right]]47,XYY is not inherited, but usually occurs as a random event during the formation of [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] cells. An error in chromosome separation during anaphase II (of [[meiosis#Meiosis II|meiosis II]]) called [[nondisjunction]] can result in sperm cells with an extra copy of the Y-chromosome. If one of these atypical sperm cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra Y-chromosome in each of the body's cells.<ref name="Robinson 1999">{{cite journal |author=Robinson, David O.; Jacobs, Patricia A. |date=November 1, 1999 |title=The origin of the extra Y chromosome in males with a 47,XYY karyotype |journal=[[Human Molecular Genetics|Hum Mol Genet]] |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=2205–2209 |pmid=10545600 |url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/8/12/2205.pdf |doi=10.1093/hmg/8.12.2205}}</ref>

In some cases, the addition of an extra Y-chromosome results from nondisjunction during cell division during a post-zygotic [[mitosis]] in early embryonic development. This can produce 46,XY/47,XYY [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]]s.<ref name="Robinson 1999"/>

For some, the urge to violence may be inborn—traced to something called the Y chromosome...<br />Once in every 500 male births, for example, the sex chromosome complement is XXY rather than XY, thus erring in the direction of femaleness. The resulting individual, called a Klinefelter male, is usually retarded, unusually tall and sterile.<br />Erring in the other direction, however, is the XYY complement resulting in the "supermale." He is also unusually tall and somewhat retarded, but appears to be highly, perhaps too highly, sexually motivated...<br />We were intrigued by Dr. Jacobs' contention that an extra Y chromosome results in tall stature, mild mental retardation, and severely disordered personality characterized by violent, aggressive behavior. We therefore planned to confirm and extend her studies.<br /><br />''Syndrome Status for the XYY''<br />The XXY male has long been thought to display a constellation of symptoms that makes him diagnosable; that is, he has achieved syndrome status. It would seem that the XYY male is fast achieving similar status. His symptoms, as we and other laboratories tend to think of them, are: extremely tall stature, long limbs and strikingly long arm span, facial acne, mild mental retardation, severe mental illness (including psychosis) and aggressive, antisocial behavior with a long history of arrests, frequently beginning at an early age.<br />On reading newspaper accounts of Richard Speck, who murdered eight Chicago student nurses in 1966, we noted all these traits and therefore concluded that Speck was a likely candidate for the XYY disorder. Independently, a cytogenetic laboratory in Chicago confirmed this hunch, reinforcing our inclination to believe that the XYY syndrome is really coming of age. It seems quite possible that in the XYY male, exemplified by Speck, biologists are describing in genetic terms a certain type of defective criminal who has long been explicitly recognized by the forensic psychiatrist.</blockquote></ref>

In May 1997, ''[[Nature Genetics]]'' published the discovery by Ercole Rao and colleagues of the X/Y chromosome [[pseudoautosomal region]] (PAR1) [[short stature homeobox gene|SHOX]] gene, [[haploinsufficiency]] of which leads to short stature in [[Turner syndrome]] (45,X).<ref name="Rao 1997">{{cite journal |last1=Rao|first1=Ercole|last2=Weiss|first2=Birgit|last3=Fukami|first3=Maki|last4=Rump|first4=Andreas|last5=Niesler|first5=Beate|last6=Mertz|first6=Annelyse|last7=Muroya|first7=Koji|last8=Binder|first8=Gerhard|last9=Kirsch|first9=Stefan|last10=Winkelmann|first10=Martina|last11=Nordsiek|first11=Gabriele|last12=Heinrich|first12=Udo|last13=Breuning|first13=Martijn H.|last14=Ranke|first14=Michael B.|last15=Rosenthal|first15=André|last16=Ogata|first16=Tsutomu|last17=Rappold|first17=Gudrun A. |date=May 1997 |title=Pseudoautosomal deletions encompassing a novel homeobox gene cause growth failure in idiopathic short stature and Turner syndrome |journal=[[Nature Genetics|Nat Genet]] |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=54–63 |doi=10.1038/ng0597-54 |pmid=9140395}}</ref> It was subsequently postulated that the increased gene dosage of three SHOX genes leads to tall stature in the sex chromosome trisomies 47,XXX, 47,XXY, and 47,XYY.<ref name="SHOX"/>

In July 1999, ''[[Psychological Medicine]]'' published a [[case-control study]] by [[Royal Edinburgh Hospital]] psychiatrist Michael Götz and colleagues that found an increased rate of criminal convictions among seventeen XYY men identified in the Edinburgh newborn screening study compared to an above-average-IQ control group of sixty XY men, which multiple [[logistic regression]] analysis indicated was mediated mainly through lowered intelligence.<ref name="Götz 1999">
