'''Hypochondroplasia''' is a developmental disorder caused by an [[autosomal dominant]] genetic defect in the [[fibroblast growth factor receptor]] 3 gene (''[[FGFR3]]'')<ref name="pmid17256796">{{cite journal |author=Santos HG, Almeida M, Fernandes H, Wilkie A |title=Clinical hypochondroplasia in a family caused by a heterozygous double mutation in FGFR3 encoding GLY380LYS |journal=Am.

It is also known as "achondroplasia tarda" and "atypical achondroplasia."

It is classified as short-limbed [[dwarfism]].<ref name="urlHypochondroplasia - Genetics Home Reference">{{cite web |url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=hypochondroplasia |title=Hypochondroplasia - Genetics Home Reference |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref>

==Features==
People affected by this disorder appear normal at [[birth]]. As the infant grows, however, their arms and legs do not develop properly and their body becomes thicker and shorter than normal. The head is normal but appears large due to the underdevelopment of other parts of the body, a symptom called "relative [[macrocephaly]]".

The clinical and radiographic features of this disorder are milder than those seen in [[achondroplasia]].

[[Intelligence]] is usually normal.

==Pathophysiology==
This disorder results from mutations in the proximal [[tyrosine kinase]] domain of the ''FGFR3'' gene.  This gene plays an important role in [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]], playing a part in regulating activities such as cell division, migration, and differentiation.

==Treatment==
Standard treatment of hypochondroplasia usually takes the form of [[orthopedic surgery]] and [[physical therapy]].  [[Genetic counseling]] is advised for patients and their families.

==Etiology==
This disorder is transmitted as an [[autosomal dominant]] trait affecting the ''FGFR3'' gene on [[chromosome]] 4p16.3.<ref name="pmid16912704">{{cite journal |author=Heuertz S, Le Merrer M, Zabel B, ''et al.'' |title=Novel FGFR3 mutations creating cysteine residues in the extracellular domain of the receptor cause achondroplasia or severe forms of hypochondroplasia |journal=Eur.

There is no cure for this condition.

==Epidemiology==
Females tend to be affected more often than males.
