'''Pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias''' (PPSH) refers to a configuration of the external [[genitalia]] of an infant. In a sense, this configuration is roughly midway between normal male genitalia and normal female genitalia in structure and appearance. It is a relatively common form of [[ambiguous genitalia|genital ambiguity]] caused by under[[virilization]] of genetic males due to several different [[intersex]] conditions.

==Presentation==
PPSH usually consists of:
* a [[phallus]] midway in size between [[penis]] and [[clitoris]],
* a [[chordee]] tethering it to the [[perineum]],
* a [[urethra]]l opening usually on the perineum (the [[hypospadias]]),
* and an incompletely closed urogenital opening, which resembles a small and shallow [[vagina]].
[[Testes]] are often palpable in the [[scrotum]] or [[inguinal canal]]s, and the [[karyotype]] is XY. In most cases there are no internal female structures such as a [[uterus]] or other [[mullerian duct]] derivatives.

==Causes==
It is considered a form of [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency]] involving [[SRD5A2]].<ref name="pmid16098368">{{cite journal |author=Bahceci M, Ersay AR, Tuzcu A, Hiort O, Richter-Unruh A, Gokalp D |title=A novel missense mutation of 5-alpha reductase type 2 gene (SRD5A2) leads to severe male pseudohermaphroditism in a Turkish family |journal=Urology |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=407–10 |year=2005 |pmid=16098368 |doi=10.1016/j.urology.2005.02.021}}</ref><ref name="NieschlagBehre2009">{{cite book|author1=Eberhard Nieschlag|author2=Hermann M.

==Management==
When an infant is born with PSH, the most difficult management decision has often been the [[sex assignment]], since genitalia with this degree of ambiguity do not resemble either sex very well with respect to looks or function. Many infants with PPHS have been assigned and [[sex of rearing|raised]] as female despite presence of testes and XY chromosomes. 

Nearly all infants with PPSH are offered [[intersex surgery|surgical reconstruction]], to either further masculinize or feminize the external genitalia. 

Treatment with testosterone postnatally does not close the [[urethra]] or change the malformation, but in some cases may enlarge the penis slightly.
