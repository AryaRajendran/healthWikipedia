'''Toxic epidermal necrolysis''' (TEN) (also known as "Lyell's syndrome"<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>) is a rare, life-threatening [[dermatology|skin]] condition that is usually caused by a reaction to drugs.<ref name=garra/> The top layer of skin (the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]) detaches from the lower layers of the skin (the [[dermis]]) all over the body.

TEN is a more severe form of [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]]. There is debate about whether it falls on a spectrum of disease that includes [[erythema multiforme]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carrozzo M, Togliatto M, Gandolfo S |title=Erythema multiforme. A heterogeneous pathologic phenotype |journal=Minerva Stomatol |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=217–26 |year=1999 |pmid=10434539}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Farthing P, Bagan J, Scully C |title=Mucosal disease series. Number IV. Erythema multiforme |journal=Oral Dis |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=261–7 |year=2005 |pmid=16120111 |doi=10.1111/j.1601-0825.2005.01141.x}}</ref> Some authors consider that there is an overlap between the two syndromes (usually between 10% and 30% of skin detachment).

The [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] is between 0.4 and 1.3 cases per million each year.<ref name=garra/>

==Signs and symptoms==
TEN affects many parts of the body, but it most severely affects the [[mucous membrane]]s, such as the [[mouth]], [[Human eyes|eyes]], and [[vagina]].  The severe findings of TEN are often preceded by 1 to 2 weeks of [[fever]].  These symptoms may mimic those of a common [[upper respiratory tract infection]].  When the [[rash]] appears it may be over large and varied parts of the body, and it is usually warm and appears red.  The dermal layer fills with fluid being deposited there by the body's immune system, usually as a result of a negative reaction to an antibiotic. The skin then begins to sag from the body and can be peeled off in great swaths.  The mouth becomes blistered and eroded, making eating difficult and sometimes necessitating feeding through a [[nasogastric tube]] through the nose or a [[Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy|gastric tube]] directly into the stomach.  The eyes are affected, becoming swollen, crusted, and ulcerated and blindness may occur.

===Pathology===
TEN, like [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]] and [[erythema multiforme]], are characterized by confluent epidermal [[necrosis]] with minimal associated inflammation.  The acuity is apparent from the (normal) basket weave-like pattern of the [[stratum corneum]].

==Cause==
Toxic epidermal necrolysis is a rare and usually severe adverse reaction to certain drugs. History of medication use exists in over 95% of patients with TEN.<ref name=garra/> The drugs most often implicated in TEN are antibiotics such as sulfonamides, [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]], [[allopurinol]],  [[antimetabolites]] ([[methotrexate]]), [[antiretroviral drugs]], [[corticosteroids]], [[chlormezanone]] ([[anxiolytic]]) and [[anticonvulsant]]s such as [[phenobarbital]], [[phenytoin]], [[carbamazepine]], and [[valproic acid]].<ref name=garra/>

The condition might also result from infection with agents such as ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'' or the [[Herpes simplex virus|herpes virus]]; and [[Organ transplant|transplant]]s of [[bone marrow]] or organs.<ref name=garra/>

==Pathogenesis==
Microscopically, TEN causes [[cell death]] throughout the epidermis.  [[Keratinocytes]], which are the cells found lower in the epidermis,  specializing in holding the skin cells together, undergo [[necrosis]] (cell death).

==Diagnosis==
{{Expand section|date=November 2007}}
Often, the diagnosis can be made clinically. Generally, if the clinical history is consistent with Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and the skin lesion covers greater than 30% of the body surface area, the diagnosis of TEN is appropriate.  Sometimes, however, examination of affected tissue under the microscope may be needed to distinguish it between other entities such as [[staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome]]. Typical histological criteria of TEN include mild infiltrate of lymphocytes which may obscure the [[dermoepidermal junction]] and prominent cell death with basal vacuolar change and individual cell necrosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pereira FA, Mudgil AV, Rosmarin DM |title=Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=181–200 |year=2007 |pmid=17224365 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2006.04.048}}</ref>

[[Nikolsky's sign]] is almost always present in toxic epidermal necrolysis<ref>{{cite journal |author=Asz J, Asz D, Moushey R, Seigel J, Mallory SB, Foglia RP |title=Treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis in a pediatric patient with a nanocrystalline silver dressing |journal=J. Pediatr. Surg. |volume=41 |issue=12 |pages=e9–12 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17161178 |doi=10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2006.08.043 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-3468(06)00609-9}}</ref>

Quite often misdiagnosis is made during the early stages of TEN.  Symptoms are often mistaken for [[Chicken Pox]], [[Scarlet Fever]] and various others. This in turn results in the offending drug still being used or prescribed leading to devastating results.

==Treatment==
The first line of treatment is early withdrawal of culprit drugs, early referral and management in [[burn unit]]s or [[intensive care unit]]s, supportive management, and nutritional support.

The second line is [[Intravenous immunoglobulin]] (IVIG). Uncontrolled trials showed promising effect of IVIG <ref>{{cite journal |author=Rajaratnam R, Mann C, Balasubramaniam P, ''et al.'' |title=Toxic epidermal necrolysis: retrospective analysis of 21 consecutive cases managed at a tertiary centre |journal=Clin. Exp. Dermatol. |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=853–62 |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=20456393 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2230.2010.03826.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0307-6938&date=2010&volume=35&issue=8&spage=853}}</ref> on treatment of TEN; a [[randomized control trial]] is needed in the future to determine the efficacy of IVIG in TEN.

The third line is [[cyclosporin]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[plasmapheresis]], [[pentoxifylline]], [[N-acetylcysteine]], [[ulinastatin]], [[infliximab]], and/or [[Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor|Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors]] (if TEN associated-[[leukopenia]] exists).

==Prognosis==
The mortality for toxic epidermal necrolysis is 30–40 percent.<ref name=garra>Garra, GP (2007). "[http://www.emedicine.com/EMERG/topic599.htm Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis]". Emedicine.com. Retrieved on December 13, 2007.</ref>  Loss of the skin leaves patients vulnerable to infections from [[fungi]] and [[bacteria]], and can result in [[sepsis]], the leading cause of death in the disease.<ref name=garra/> Death is caused either by [[infection]] or by [[respiratory distress]] which is either due to [[pneumonia]] or damage to the linings of the airway. Microscopic analysis of tissue (especially the degree of dermal mononuclear inflammation and the degree of inflammation in general) can play a role in determining the prognosis of individual cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Quinn AM et al. |title=Uncovering histological criteria with prognostic significance in toxic epidermal necrolysis |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=141 |issue=6 |pages=683–7 |year=2005 |pmid=15967913 |doi=10.1001/archderm.141.6.683}}</ref>

A Swiss medical study recorded the day-to-day evolution of the epidermis in a TEN patient. Pictures show the initial bullous stage as well as the skin healing.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Feldmeyer L, Harr T, Cozzio A, French LE, Navarini AA |title=Skin Detachment and Regrowth in Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis |journal=Case Rep Dermatol |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=60–64 |year=2010 |pmid=21173930 |pmc=3004215 |doi=10.1159/000313866 |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&file=313866}}</ref>
