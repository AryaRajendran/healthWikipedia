Under the "agreement state" legislative framework of the [[Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act]], the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] left New Mexico to handle the dam failure until October 12, 1979, when it was notified that the state would permit the uranium mill to resume operation that week.
