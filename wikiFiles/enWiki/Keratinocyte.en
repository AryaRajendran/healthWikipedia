==Function==
The primary function of keratinocytes is the formation of a barrier against environmental damage such as [[pathogens]] ([[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[parasites]], [[viruses]]), [[heat]], [[UV radiation]] and [[water loss]]. Once [[pathogens]] start to invade the upper layers of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], keratinocytes can react with the production of [[proinflammatory]] mediators and in particular [[chemokines]] such as [[CXCL10]], [[CCL2]] which attract [[leukocytes]] to the site of [[pathogen]] invasion. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Structure==
A number of structural [[proteins]] ([[filaggrin]], [[keratin]]), [[enzymes]] ([[proteases]]), [[lipids]] and [[antimicrobial peptides]] ([[defensins]]) contribute to maintain the important barrier function of the [[skin]]. Keratinization is part of the physical barrier formation ([[Keratin#Cornification|cornification]]), in which the keratinocytes produce more and more keratin and eventually undergo [[apoptosis|programmed cell death]]. The fully cornified keratinocytes that form the outermost layer are constantly shed off and replaced by new [[cell (biology)|cells]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Cell differentiation==
Keratinocytes are formed first by [[cell differentiation|differentiation]] from [[epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] [[stem cells]] (transit amplifying [[cell (biology)|cells)]], residing in the lower part of the [[stratum basale]] of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], attached to the [[basement membrane]] through [[hemidesmosomes]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid=11912004 | year=2002 | last1=Watt | first1=FM | title=The stem cell compartment in human interfollicular epidermis | volume=28 | issue=3 | pages=173–80 | journal=Journal of dermatological science | doi=10.1016/S0923-1811(02)00003-8}}</ref> Those [[stem cells]] and their [[cell differentiation|differentiated]] [[cell division|progeny]] are organized into columns named epidermal proliferation units.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid=4852053 | year=1974 | last1=Allen | first1=TD | last2=Potten | first2=CS | title=Fine-structural identification and organization of the epidermal proliferative unit | volume=15 | issue=2 | pages=291–319 | journal=Journal of Cell Science}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid=11250888 | year=2001 | last1=Ghazizadeh | first1=S | last2=Taichman | first2=LB | title=Multiple classes of stem cells in cutaneous epithelium: A lineage analysis of adult mouse skin | volume=20 | issue=6 | pages=1215–22 | doi=10.1093/emboj/20.6.1215 | pmc=145528 | journal=The EMBO Journal}}</ref> Keratinocytes in the [[stratum basale]] layer of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] are attached together through [[desmosomes]] and will [[cell proliferation|proliferate]] through a few rounds of [[cell division]]s within the [[stratum basale]] before moving up through the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] as they [[cell differentiation|differentiate]]. 

During this [[cell differentiation|differentiation]] process, keratinocytes permanently withdraw from the [[cell cycle]], initiate expression of [[epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] [[cell differentiation|differentiation]] markers, and move suprabasally as they become part of the [[stratum spinosum]], [[stratum granulosum]] and eventually become [[corneocyte]]s in the [[stratum corneum]].

[[Corneocyte]]s are keratinocytes that have completed their [[cell differentiation|differentiation]] program and have lost their [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[cytoplasm]]ic [[organelles]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04363.x | title=Making an Epidermis | year=2009 | last1=Koster | first1=Maranke I. | journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume=1170 | pages=7–10 | pmid=19686098 | pmc=2861991}}</ref> [[Corneocyte]]s will eventually be shed off through [[desquamation]] as new one come in.

At each stage of [[cell differentiation|differentiation]], keratinocytes express specific [[keratins]], such as [[keratin 1]], [[keratin 5]], [[keratin 10]] and [[keratin 14]], but also other markers such as [[involucrin]], [[loricrin]], [[transglutaminase]], [[filaggrin]] and [[caspase 14]].

In [[humans]], it is estimated that keratinocytes [[cell turnover|turnover]] from [[stem cells]] to [[desquamation]] every 40–56 days<ref>{{cite journal | pmid=4551262 | year=1972 | last1=Halprin | first1=KM | title=Epidermal "turnover time"--a re-examination | volume=86 | issue=1 | pages=14–9 | journal=The British journal of dermatology}}</ref> whereas in [[mice]] the estimated [[cell turnover|turnover]] time is 8–10 days.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid=3450396 | year=1987 | last1=Potten | first1=CS | last2=Saffhill | first2=R | last3=Maibach | first3=HI | title=Measurement of the transit time for cells through the epidermis and stratum corneum of the mouse and guinea-pig | volume=20 | issue=5 | pages=461–72 | journal=Cell and tissue kinetics}}</ref>

Factors promoting keratinocyte [[cell differentiation|differentiation]]:

* A [[calcium]] gradient, with the lowest concentration in the [[stratum basale]] and increasing concentrations until the outer [[stratum granulosum]], where it reaches its maximum. [[Calcium]] concentration in the [[stratum corneum]] is very low in part because those relatively dry [[cell (biology)|cells]] are not able to dissolve the ions.<ref name="Proksch">{{cite journal

Since keratinocyte [[cell differentiation|differentiation]] stops keratinocyte [[cell division|proliferation]], factors that promote keratinocyte [[cell division|proliferation]] should be considered as preventing [[cell differentiation|differentiation]], such as:

==Interaction with other cells==
Within the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] keratinocytes are associated with other cell types such as [[melanocytes]] and [[Langerhans cell]]s. Keratinocytes form [[tight junction]]s with the nerves of the [[skin]] and hold the [[Langerhans cell]]s and intra-dermal [[lymphocytes]] in position within the epidermis. Keratinocytes also modulate the [[immune system]]:  apart from the above mentioned [[antimicrobial peptides]] and [[chemokines]] they are also potent producers of anti-inflammatory mediators such as [[interleukin 10|IL-10]] and [[Transforming growth factor (TGF) beta|TGF-β]]. When activated, they can stimulate [[cutaneous]] [[inflammation]] and [[Langerhans cell]] activation via [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|TNFα]] and [[IL1B|IL-1β]] secretion.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Keratinocytes contribute to protecting the body from [[ultraviolet]] radiation (UVR) by taking up [[melanosome]]s, vesicles containing the endogenous [[photoprotection|photoprotectant]] [[melanin]], from [[epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] [[melanocyte]]s. Each [[melanocyte]] in the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] has several [[dendrite]]s that stretch out to connect it with many keratinocytes. The [[melanin]] is then stored within keratinocytes and melanocytes in the perinuclear area as supranuclear “caps”, where it protects the [[DNA]] from UVR-induced [[DNA_damage#DNA_damage|damage]].<ref>

==Role in wound healing==
[[Wounds]] to the [[skin]] will be repaired in part by the migration of keratinocytes to fill in the gap created by the [[wound]]. The first set of keratinocytes to participate in that repair come from the bulge region of the [[hair follicle]] and will only survive transiently. Within the healed [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] they will be replaced by keratinocytes originating from the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid=16288281 | year=2005 | last1=Ito | first1=M | last2=Liu | first2=Y | last3=Yang | first3=Z | last4=Nguyen | first4=J | last5=Liang | first5=F | last6=Morris | first6=RJ | last7=Cotsarelis | first7=G | title=Stem cells in the hair follicle bulge contribute to wound repair but not to homeostasis of the epidermis | volume=11 | issue=12 | pages=1351–4 | doi=10.1038/nm1328 | journal=Nature Medicine}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid=16203973 | year=2005 | last1=Claudinot | first1=S | last2=Nicolas | first2=M | last3=Oshima | first3=H | last4=Rochat | first4=A | last5=Barrandon | first5=Y | title=Long-term renewal of hair follicles from clonogenic multipotent stem cells | volume=102 | issue=41 | pages=14677–82 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0507250102 | pmc=1253596 | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America}}</ref>
