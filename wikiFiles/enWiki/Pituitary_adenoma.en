'''Pituitary adenomas''' are noncancerous [[tumor]]s that occur in the [[pituitary gland]]. Pituitary adenomas are generally divided into three categories dependant upon their biological functioning: benign adenoma, invasive adenoma or [[carcinomas]], with carcinomas accounting for 0.1% to 0.2%, approximately 35% being invasive adenomas and most being benign adenomas. Pituitary adenomas represent from 10% to 25% of all intracranial [[neoplasia|neoplasms]]{{cn|date=February 2013}} and the estimated [[prevalence|prevalence rate]] in the general population is approximately 17%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ezzat|first=Shereen|coauthors=Asa, S.

Non-invasive and non-secreting pituitary adenomas are considered to be [[Benign tumors|benign]] in the literal as well as the clinical sense; however a recent [[meta-analysis]] (Fernández-Balsells, ''et al.'' 2011) of available research has shown there are to date scant studies - of poor quality - to either support or refute this assumption.

Adenomas which exceed {{convert|10|mm}} in size are defined as ''macroadenomas'', with those smaller than 10&nbsp;mm referred to as ''microadenomas''. Most pituitary adenomas are microadenomas, and have an estimated prevalence of 16.7% (14.4% in [[autopsy]] studies and 22.5% in [[Medical imaging|radiologic]] studies).<ref name="pmid15274075">{{cite journal |author=Ezzat S, Asa SL, Couldwell WT, Barr CE, Dodge WE, Vance ML, McCutcheon IE. |title=The prevalence of pituitary adenomas: a systematic review |journal=Cancer |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=613–9 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15274075 |doi=10.1002/cncr.20412 |accessdate=2008-09-03}}</ref><ref name="pmid18684022">{{cite journal |author=Asa SL |title=Practical pituitary pathology: what does the pathologist need to know? |journal=Arch.

==Overview==
[[File:Gray1180.png|thumb|Pituitary gland]]
The pituitary gland or hypophysis is often referred to as the "master gland" of the human body. Part of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary axis]], it controls most of the body's [[endocrine]] functions via the secretion of various [[hormone]]s into the [[circulatory system]]. The pituitary gland is located below the brain in a depression ([[Fossa (anatomy)|fossa]]) of the [[sphenoid bone]] known as the [[sella turcica]]. Although anatomically and functionally connected to the brain, the pituitary gland is enveloped by the [[dura mater]] and sits outside the [[blood–brain barrier]]. It is separated from the [[subarachnoid space]] by the [[diaphragma sella]], therefore the [[arachnoid mater]] and thus [[cerebral spinal fluid]] cannot enter the sella turcica.   

The pituitary gland is divided into two lobes, the anterior lobe (which accounts for two thirds of the volume of the gland), and the posterior lobe (one third of the volume) separated by the [[pars intermedia]]. 

The [[Posterior pituitary|posterior lobe]] (the neural lobe or neurohypophysis) of the pituitary gland is not, despite its name, a true [[gland]]. The posterior lobe contains [[axons]] of [[neurons]] that extend from the [[hypothalamus]] to which it is connected via the pituitary stalk. The hormones [[vasopressin]] and [[oxytocin]], produced by the neurons of the [[Supraoptic nucleus|supraoptic]] and [[paraventricular nuclei]] of the hypothalamus, are stored in the posterior lobe and released from axon endings ([[dendrites]]) within the lobe.<ref>Nussey S, Whitehead S.: Endocrinology: An Integrated Approach; Oxford: BIOS Scientific Publishers; (2001)</ref>

The pituitary gland's [[Anterior pituitary|anterior lobe]] (adenohypophysis) is a true gland which produces and secretes six different hormones: [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH), [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH), [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH), [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH), [[growth hormone]] (GH), and [[prolactin]] (PRL).<ref>Yangu Zhaoa, Christina M. Maillouxa, 1, Edit Hermesza, ''et al.'' A role of the LIM-homeobox gene Lhx2 in the regulation of pituitary development. Developmental Biology. Volume 337, Issue 2, 15 January 2010, Pages 313–323 [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160609013384]</ref>

==Classification==
Pituitary adenomas are classified based on upon [[Anatomy|anatomical]], [[Histology|histological]] and functional criteria.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12890801 | volume=56 | issue=8 | title=Best Practice No 172: pituitary gland pathology | pmc=1770019 | year=2003 | month=August | author=Ironside JW | journal=J. Clin. Pathol. | pages=561–8}}</ref> 

*Anatomically  pituitary tumors are classified by their size based on radiological findings; either microadenomas (less than <10&nbsp;mm) or macroadenomas (equal or greater than ≥I0 mm).
 
:Classification based on radioanatomical findings places adenomas into 1 of 4 grades (I–IV):<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 9861546 | volume=19 | issue=6 | title=The cytogenesis and pathogenesis of pituitary adenomas | year=1998 | month=December | author=Asa SL, Ezzat S | journal=Endocr. Rev. | pages=798–827}}</ref>

:Stage I: microadenomas (<1 cm) without sella expansion.

:Stage II:  macroadenomas (≥1 cm) and may extend above the sella.

:Stage III:  macroadenomas with enlargement and invasion of the floor or suprasellar extension.

:Stage IV is destruction of the sella.

*Histological classification utilizes an immunohistological characterization of the tumors in terms of their hormone production.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12890801 | volume=56 | issue=8 | title=Best Practice No 172: pituitary gland pathology | pmc=1770019 | year=2003 | month=August | author=Ironside JW | journal=J. Clin. Pathol. | pages=561–8}}</ref>  Historically they were classed as either [[basophilic]], [[Acidophile (histology)|acidophilic]], or [[chromophobic]] on the basis of whether or not they took up the [[Tincture|tinctorial]] stains [[hematoxylin]] and [[eosin]]. This classification has fallen into disuse, in favor of a classification based on what type of [[hormone]] is secreted by the tumor. Approximately 20-25% of adenomas do not secrete any readily identifiable active hormones ('non-functioning tumors') yet they are still sometimes referred to as 'chromophobic'. 

*Functional classification is based upon the tumors endocrine activity as determined by [[Serum (blood)|serum]] hormone levels detected via [[immunohistochemical staining]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 7424602 | volume=52 | issue=3-4 | title=Functional classification of pituitary adenomas | year=1980 | author=Scanarini M, Mingrino S | journal=Acta Neurochir (Wien) | pages=195–202}}</ref> The "Percentage of hormone production cases" values are the fractions of adenomas producing each related hormone of each tumor type as compared to all cases of pituitary tumors, and does not directly correlate to the percentages of each tumor type because of smaller or greater incidences of absence of secretion of the expected hormone. Thus, nonsecretive adenomas may be either ''[[null cell]] adenomas'' or a more specific adenoma that, however, remains nonsecretive.

===Pituitary incidentalomas===
Pituitary incidentalomas are pituitary tumors that are characterized as an [[Incidental findings|incidental finding]]. They are often discovered by [[computed tomography]] (CT) or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), performed in the evaluation of unrelated medical conditions such as suspected [[Head injury|head trauma]], in [[cancer staging]] or in the evaluation  of [[nonspecific symptom]]s such as [[dizziness]] and [[headache]]. It is not uncommon for them to be discovered at [[autopsy]]. In a [[meta-analysis]], adenomas were found in an average of 16.7% in postmortem studies, with most being  microadenomas (<10mm); macrodenomas accounted for only 0.16% to 0.2% of the decedents.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15274075 | doi=10.1002/cncr.20412 | volume=101 | issue=3 | journal = Cancer | year=2004 | title = The prevalence of pituitary adenomas | month=August | pages=613–9 | author=Ezzat S, Asa SL, Couldwell WT, ''et al.''}}</ref> While non-secreting, noninvasive pituitary microadenomas are generally considered to be literally as well as [[Benign tumor|clinically benign]], there are to date scant studies of low quality to support this assertion.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 21474687 | doi=10.1210/jc.2010-1054 | volume=96 | issue=4 | title=Natural history of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas and incidentalomas: a systematic review and metaanalysis | year=2011 | month=April | author=Fernández-Balsells MM, Murad MH, Barwise A, ''et al.'' | journal=J.

Leestma</ref>

It has been recommended in the current Clinical Practice Guidelines (2011)  by the [[Endocrine Society]] - a professional, international medical organization in the field of endocrinology and metabolism - that all patients with pituitary incidentalomas undergo a complete [[medical history]] and [[physical examination]], laboratory evaluations to screen  for hormone hypersecretion and for [[hypopituitarism]]. If the lesion is in close proximity to the [[optic nerve]]s or [[optic chiasm]], a [[Visual field test|visual field examination]] should be performed. For those with incidentalomas which do not require surgical removal, follow up clinical assessments and  neuroimaging should be performed as well follow-up visual field examinations for incidentalomas that abut or compress the optic nerve and chiasm and follow-up endocrine testing for macroincidentalomas.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Freda PU, Beckers AM, Katznelson L ''et al.'' | year = 2011 | month = Apr | title = , Pituitary incidentaloma: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline | url = | journal = J Clin Endocrinol Metab | volume = 96 | issue = 4| pages = 894–904 | pmid = 21474686 | doi=10.1210/jc.2010-1048}}</ref>

===Ectopic pituitary adenoma===
An ectopic (occurring in an abnormal place) pituitary adenoma is a rare type of tumor which occurs outside of the [[sella turcica]], most often in the [[sphenoid sinus]],<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 22430769 | doi=10.1007/s12105-012-0336-9 | volume=6 | issue=1 | title=Ectopic sphenoid sinus pituitary adenoma (ESSPA) with normal anterior pituitary gland: a clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic study of 32 cases with a comprehensive review of the english literature | year=2012 | month=March | author=Thompson LD, Seethala RR, Müller S | journal=Head Neck Pathol | pages=75–100}}</ref> suprasellar region, [[nasopharynx]] and the [[cavernous sinus]]es.<ref>Leon Barnes: Pathology and genetics of head and neck tumours; p.100: World Health Organization; (2005) ISBN 92-832-2417-5</ref>

===Metastases to the pituitary gland===
Carcinomas that [[Metastasis|metastasize]] into the pituitary gland are uncommon and typically seen in the elderly,<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12470187 | volume=59 | issue=12 | title=Pituitary metastasis | year=2002 | month=December | author=Weil RJ | journal=Arch.

Symptomatic pituitary metastases account for only 7% of reported cases. In those who are symptomatic [[Diabetes insipidus]] often occurs with rates approximately 29-71%. Other commonly reported symptoms include anterior pituitary dysfunction, visual field defects, headache/pain, and [[ophthalmoplegia]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Komninos J, Vlassopoulou V, Protopapa D ''et al.'' | year = 2004 | month = Feb | title = .

==Risk factors==

===Multiple endocrine neoplasia===
Adenomas of the anterior pituitary gland are a major clinical feature of [[multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1]] (MEN1), a rare inherited endocrine syndrome that affects 1 person in every 30,000. MEN causes various combinations of benign or malignant tumors in various glands in the endocrine system or may cause the glands to become [[Hyperplasia|enlarged]] without forming tumors. It often affects the [[parathyroid gland]]s, pancreatic islet cells, and anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. MEN1 may also cause non-endocrine tumors such as facial [[angiofibroma]]s, [[collagenoma]]s, [[lipoma]]s, [[meningiomas]], [[ependymoma]]s, and [[leiomyomas]]. Approximately 25 percent of patients with MEN1 develop pituitary adenomas.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 21454234 | doi=10.4158/EP10379.RA | volume=17 Suppl 3 | title=Role of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 mutational analysis in clinical practice | year=2011 | author=Newey PJ, Thakker RV | journal=Endocr Pract | pages=8–17}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 21249756 | author=Riegert-Johnson DL, Boardman LA, Hefferon T, ''et al.''}}</ref>

===Carney complex===
[[Carney complex]] (CNC), also known as '''LAMB syndrome'''<ref name="Schwartz20110502">{{EMedicine|article|1097150|Carney Syndrome}}</ref> and '''NAME syndrome'''<ref name="Schwartz20110502" /> is an [[autosomal dominant]] condition comprising [[myxoma]]s of the heart and skin, hyperpigmentation of the skin ([[lentiginosis]]), and [[endocrine]] overactivity and is distinct from [[Carney's triad]].<ref name="Carney1985">{{cite pmid|4010501}}</ref><ref name="McCarthy1986">{{cite pmid|3951243}}</ref> Approximately 7% of all cardiac myxomas are associated with Carney complex.<ref name="Reynen1995">{{cite doi|10.1056/NEJM199512143332407}}</ref> Patients with CNC develop [[growth hormone]] (GH)-producing pituitary tumors and in some instances these same tumors also secrete [[prolactin]]. There are however no isolated prolactinomas or any other type of pituitary tumor. In some patients with CNC, the pituitary gland is characterized by [[hyperplasia|hyperplastic]] areas with the hyperplasia most likely preceding the formation of GH-producing adenomas.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15761655 | doi=10.1007/s11102-005-5348-y | volume=7 | issue=2 | title=Pituitary pathology in Carney complex patients | pmc=2366887 | year=2004 | author=Stergiopoulos SG, Abu-Asab MS, Tsokos M, Stratakis CA | journal=Pituitary | pages=73–82}}</ref>

===Familial isolated pituitary adenoma===
Familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) is a term that used to identify a condition that displays an [[autosomal dominant]] inheritance and is characterised by the presence of two or more related patients affected by adenomas of the pituitary gland only, with no other no other associated symptoms that occur in Multiple endocrine neoplasia Type 1 or [[Carney complex]].<ref>[[Medscape]]: Adrian F Daly; Jean-François Vanbellinghen; Albert Beckers: Characteristics of Familial Isolated Pituitary Adenomas [http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/565829]</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16787992 | doi=10.1210/jc.2005-2671 | volume=91 | issue=9 | title=Clinical characterization of familial isolated pituitary adenomas | year=2006 | month=September | author=Daly AF, Jaffrain-Rea ML, Ciccarelli A, ''et al.'' | journal=J.

==Symptoms==

===Physical===
[[File:Bitempvf labelled.png|right|thumb|alt=Binocular image with the outer halves of each circle removed | [[Visual field]] loss in '''[[bitemporal hemianopsia]]''': peripheral vision loss affecting both eyes, resulting from a tumor-typically a pituitary adenoma- putting pressure on the [[optic chiasm]].]]
Hormone secreting pituitary adenomas cause one of several forms of [[hyperpituitarism]]. The specifics depend on the type of hormone. Some tumors secrete more than one hormone, the most common combination being GH and [[prolactin]]. 

A pituitary adenoma may present with [[visual field]] defects, classically [[Bitemporal hemianopsia|bitemporal hemianopia]]. It arises from the compression of the [[optic nerve]] by the tumor. The specific area of the visual pathway at which compression by these tumours occurs is at the [[optic chiasma]]. 

The anatomy of this structure causes pressure on it to produce a defect in the temporal visual field on both sides, a condition called [[bitemporal hemianopsia|bitemporal hemianopia]]. If originating superior to the [[optic chiasm]], more commonly in a [[craniopharyngioma]] of the [[pituitary stalk]], the visual field defect will first appear as [[Quadrantanopia|bitemporal inferior quadrantanopia]], if originating inferior to the [[optic chiasm]] the visual field defect will first appear as [[Quadrantanopia|bitemporal superior quadrantanopia]]. Lateral expansion of a pituitary adenoma can also compress the [[abducens nerve]], causing a [[lateral rectus]] palsy.

Also, a pituitary adenoma can cause symptoms of [[Intracranial pressure#Increased ICP|increased intracranial pressure]].

Prolactinomas often start to give symptoms especially during pregnancy, when the [[hormone]] [[progesterone]] increases the tumor's growth rate.

Various types of headaches are common in patients with pituitary adenomas. The adenoma may be the prime causative factor behind the headache or may serve to exacerbate a headache caused by other factors. Amongst the types of headaches experienced are both chronic and episodic [[migraine]], and more uncommonly various unilateral headaches; primary stabbing headache,<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15888539 | doi=10.1093/brain/awh525 | volume=128 | issue=Pt 8 | title=The clinical characteristics of headache in patients with pituitary tumours | year=2005 | month=August | author=Levy MJ, Matharu MS, Meeran K, Powell M, Goadsby PJ | journal=Brain | pages=1921–30}}</ref>[[Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing|short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing]] (SUNCT)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Matharu MS, Levy MJ, Merry RT ''et al.'' | year = 2003 | month = Nov | title = SUNCT syndrome secondary to prolactinoma | url = | journal = J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry | volume = 74 | issue = 11| pages = 1590–2 | pmid = 14617728 | pmc=1738244}}</ref> - another type of stabbing headache characterized by short stabs of pain -, [[cluster headache]],<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 8984093 | volume=36 | issue=3 | title=Clusterlike headache in a patient with a pituitary adenoma.

The Journal of American Medicine. 2005;118(12) 1340–1346.</ref> CD results when a pituitary adenoma causes excessive secretion of [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) that stimulates the [[adrenal glands]] to produce excessive amounts of [[cortisol]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 10997535 | volume=62 | issue=5 | title=Cushing's disease: clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation | year=2000 | month=September | author=Kirk LF, Hash RB, Katner HP, Jones T | journal=Am Fam Physician | pages=1119–27, 1133–4}}</ref>

:Cushing's disease may cause fatigue, weight gain, fatty deposits around the abdomen and lower back (truncal obesity) and face ("moon face"), stretch marks ([[striae]]) on the skin of the abdomen, thighs, breasts and arms, [[hypertension]], [[glucose intolerance]] and various infections. In women it may cause excessive growth of facial hair ([[hirsutism]]) and in men [[erectile dysfunction]]. Psychiatric manifestations may include depression, [[anxiety]], easy irritability and emotional instability. It may also result in various [[Cognition|cognitive]] difficulties.

*[[Hyperpituitarism]] is a disease of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland which is usually caused by a functional pituitary adenoma and results in hypersecretion of adenohypophyseal hormones such as growth hormone; prolactin; thyrotropin; luteinizing hormone; follicle stimulating hormone; and adrenocorticotropic hormone.

*[[Pituitary apoplexy]] is a condition that occurs when pituitary adenomas suddenly hemorrhage internally, causing a rapid increase in size or when the tumor outgrows its' blood supply which causes [[Necrosis|tissue necrosis]] and subsequent swelling of the dead tissue. Pituitary apoplexy often presents with visual loss and sudden onset headache and requires timely treatment often with [[corticosteroids]] and if necessary surgical intervention.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11561045 | volume=71 | issue=4 | title=Precipitating factors in pituitary apoplexy | pmc=1763528 | year=2001 | month=October | author=Biousse V, Newman NJ, Oyesiku NM | journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. | pages=542–5}}</ref>

*[[Diabetes insipudus|Central diabetes insipidus]] is caused by diminished production of the [[antidiuretic hormone]] [[vasopressin]] that causes [[Polydipsia|severe thirst]] and excessive production of very dilute urine ([[polyuria]]) which can lead to [[dehydration]]. Vasopressin is produced in the [[hypothalamus]] and is then transported down the pituitary stalk and stored in the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland which then secretes it into the bloodstream.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12566720 | volume=59 Suppl 1 | title=Diabetes insipidus | year=2003 | author=Maghnie M | journal=Horm. Res. | pages=42–54}}</ref>

:The diagnosis of CDI is based on the reults of urine and blood tests, and a water deprivation test which tests the body's ability to concentrate urine. CDI is often treated with [[desmopressin acetate]] a synthetic vasopressin known as DDAVP administered via nasal spray.

==Diagnosis and workup==
Diagnosis of pituitary adenoma can be made, or at least suspected, by a constellation of related symptoms presented above. 

Tumors which cause visual difficulty are likely to be a ''macroadenoma'' greater than 10&nbsp;mm in diameter; tumors less than 10&nbsp;mm are ''microadenoma''.

The differential diagnosis includes pituitary tuberculoma, especially in developing countries and in immumocompromised patients.<ref>{{cite journal | author =  Saini KS, Patel AL, Shaikh WA, Magar LN, Pungaonkar SA  | title = Magnetic resonance spectroscopy in pituitary tuberculoma  | journal = Singapore Med J | volume = 48 | pages = 783–6 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17657390 | issue =  8}}</ref> The diagnosis is confirmed by testing hormone levels, and by radiographic imaging of the pituitary (for example, by [[CT scan]] or [[MRI]]).

==Treatment==
Treatment options depend on the type of tumor and on its size:
* '''[[Prolactinoma]]s''' are most often treated with [[bromocriptine]] or more recently, [[cabergoline]] or [[quinagolide]] which decrease tumor size as well as alleviates symptoms, both [[dopamine agonists]], and followed by serial imaging to detect any increase in size. Treatment where the tumor is large can be with [[radiation therapy]] or surgery, and patients generally respond well.  Efforts have been made to use a progesterone [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] for the treatment of prolactinomas, but so far have not proved successful.
* '''Somatotrophic adenomas''' respond to [[Somatostatin|octreotide, a long-acting somatostatin analog]], in many but not all cases according to a review of the medical literature. Unlike prolactinomas, thyrotrophic adenomas characteristically respond poorly to dopamine agonist treatment.<ref name="pmid8323093"/>
* '''Surgery''' is a common treatment for pituitary tumors. [[Transsphenoidal surgery|Trans-sphenoidal adenectomy]] surgery can often remove the tumor without affecting other parts of the brain. [[Endoscope|Endoscopic]] surgery has become common recently.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080107103837/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_4X_Surgery_61.asp?] American Cancer Society.
