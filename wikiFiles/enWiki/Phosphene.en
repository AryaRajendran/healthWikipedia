A '''phosphene''' is a [[phenomenon]] characterized by the experience of seeing [[light]] without light actually entering the [[human eye|eye]]. The word ''phosphene'' comes from the Greek words ''phos'' (light) and ''phainein'' (to show).<ref name=carr>{{cite web |url=http://www.oubliette.org.uk/Three.html |year=1995 |title=Phosphenes: The Evidence |accessdate=2008-03-25 |publisher=Suzanne Carr }}</ref> Phosphenes are flashes of light, often associated with [[optic neuritis]], induced by movement or sound.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davis F.

Phosphenes can be directly induced by mechanical, electrical, or magnetic stimulation of the [[retina]] or [[visual cortex]] as well as by random firing of cells in the [[visual system]]. Phosphenes have also been reported by [[meditation|meditators]]<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/ejvs0803/ejvs0803c.txt |title=The Soma Code, Part III: Visions, Myths, and Drugs |author=Philip T.

==Causes==

===Mechanical stimulation===

The most common phosphenes are [[pressure]] phosphenes, caused by rubbing the closed eyes. They have been known since antiquity, and described by the Greeks.<ref name="Gruesser O-J 1990">{{cite journal |author=Gruesser O. J. |author=Hagner M. | title=On the history of deformation phosphenes and the idea of internal light generated in the eye for the purpose of vision |journal=Documenta Ophthalmologica |volume=74 |date=February 1990 |issue=1–2 |pages=57–85 |pmid=2209368}}</ref> The pressure mechanically stimulates the cells of the [[retina]]. Experiences include a darkening of the visual field that moves against the rubbing, a diffuse colored patch that also moves against the rubbing, a scintillating and ever-changing and deforming light grid with occasional dark spots (like a crumpling fly-spotted flyscreen), and a sparse field of intense blue points of light. Pressure phosphenes can persist briefly after the rubbing stops and the eyes are opened, allowing the phosphenes to be seen on the visual scene. [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and others have published drawings of their pressure phosphenes.One example of a pressure phosphene is demonstrated by gently pressing the side of one's eye and observing a colored ring of light on the opposite side, as detailed by Isaac Newton.<ref>McGuire J. E., Tammy M. ''Certain philosophical Questions''. Cambridge Univ. Press, 2002. 386.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=From the library |url=http://bjo.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/87/10/1308 |journal=British Journal of Ophthalmology |year=2003 |volume=87 |issue=10 |page=1308 |doi=10.1136/bjo.87.10.1308}}</ref>

Another common phosphene is "seeing stars", from a [[sneeze]], laughter, a heavy and deep cough, blowing of the nose, a blow on the head or [[hypotension|low]] [[blood pressure]] (such as on [[postural hypotension|standing up too quickly]] or prior to fainting). It is possible these involve some mechanical stimulation of the retina, but they may also involve mechanical and [[metabolic]] (such as from low oxygenation or lack of glucose) stimulation of [[neuron]]s of the [[visual cortex]] or of other parts of the visual system.

Less commonly, phosphenes can also be caused by some diseases of the retina and nerves, such as [[multiple sclerosis]]. The British National Formulary lists phosphenes as an occasional side effect of at least one anti-anginal medication (available only by medical prescription in the United Kingdom).

The name "phosphene" was coined by J. B. H. Savigny, better known as the ship's surgeon of the wrecked ''[[Medusa (ship)|Medusa]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Savigny, J. B. H. |title=Phosphenes ou sensations loumineuses |journal=Arch. General de med. 3rd series |volume=2 |year=1838 |pages=495–97}}</ref> It was first employed by Serre d'Uzes to test retinal function prior to cataract surgery.<ref>Serre d'Uzes P. M. ''Essai sur les phosphenes ou anneaux de la retine''. Paris, Mason, 1853.</ref>

===Electrical stimulation===

Phosphenes have also been created by electrical stimulation of the brain as early as 1929 by [[neurologist]] [[Otfrid Foerster]]. Brindley and Lewin (1968) inserted a matrix of stimulating [[electrodes]] directly into the [[visual cortex]] of a 52-year-old [[blindness|blind]] man, using small pulses of [[electricity]] to create phosphenes. These phosphenes were points, spots, and bars of colorless or colored light.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=G. S. Brindley |author2=W. S. Lewin |title=The sensations produced by electrical stimulation of the visual cortex |journal=The Journal of Physiology |date=May 1, 1968 |volume=196 |issue=2 |pages=479–493 |url=http://jp.physoc.org/content/196/2/479.full.pdf+html?sid=eb57179c-8044-4a27-b590-37644ac93c5f |pmid=PMC1351724 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> Brindley and Rushton (1974) used the phosphenes to create a [[visual prosthetic|visual prosthesis]], in this case by using the phosphenes to depict [[Braille]] spots.

In recent years, researchers have successfully developed experimental [[brain-computer interfaces]] or [[neuroprosthesis]] that stimulate phosphenes to restore vision to people blinded through accidents. Notable successes include the human experiments by [[William H. Dobelle]] and Mark Humayun and animal research by Dick Normann.

Experiments with humans have shown that when the visual cortex is stimulated above the [[calcarine fissure]] phosphenes are produced in the lower part of the visual field, and vice versa.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=E. J. Tehovnik |author2=W. M. Slocum |author3=C. E. Carvey |author4=P. H. Schiller |url=http://jn.physiology.org/content/93/1/1.full.pdf |format=PDF |title=Phosphene Induction and the Generation of Saccadic Eye Movements by Striate Cortex |accessdate=2008-03-21 |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology  |doi=10.1152/jn.00736.2004 |volume=93 |pages=1–19 |year=2005}}</ref>

== Other causes ==
Phosphenes have also been created by intense, changing [[magnetic field]]s, such as with [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]]. These fields can be positioned on different parts of the head to stimulate cells in different parts of the visual system. They also can be induced by [[alternating current]]s that entrain [[neural oscillation]] as with [[trancranial alternating-current stimulation]].<ref name="Kani">Kanai R., Chaieb L., Antal A., Walsh V., Paulus W. (2008). Frequency-dependent electrical stimulation of the visual cortex. ''Curr Biol.'' 18(23):1839–43. PMID 19026538</ref> In this case they appear in the [[peripheral vision|peripheral visual field]].<ref name="Kani"/> This claim has been disputed; the alternative hypothesis is that current spread from the occipital electrode evokes phosphenes in the retina.<ref name="KarKrekelberg">Kar K, Krekelberg B.

==Explanation==

Most vision researchers believe that phosphenes result from the normal activity of the visual system after stimulation of one of its parts from some stimulus other than light. For example, Grüsser et al. showed that pressure on the eye results in activation of [[retinal ganglion cell]]s in a similar way to activation by light.<ref>Grüsser, O. J., Grüsser-Cornehls, U., Hagner, M., & Przybyszewski, A. W. (1989). Purkyne's description of pressure phosphenes and modern neurophysiological studies on the generation of phosphenes by eyeball deformation. ''Physiologia bohemoslovaca'', 38 (289–309), 1059–1068.</ref> An ancient, discredited theory is that light is generated in the eye.<ref name="Gruesser O-J 1990"/> A version of this theory has been revived, except, according to its author, that "phosphene lights are [supposed to be] due to the intrinsic perception of induced or spontaneous increased biophoton emission of cells in various parts of the visual system (from retina to cortex)"<ref>(p. 172). Bókkon, I. (2008). Phosphene phenomenon: A new concept. ''BioSystems'', 92, 168–174. {{doi|10.1016/j.biosystems.2008.02.002}}</ref>

==Anthropological research==
In 1988, [[David Lewis-Williams]] and [[T. A. Dowson]] published an article about phosphenes and other entoptic phenomena. They argued, among other things, that non-figurative art of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] depicts actual visions of phosphenes and neurological "[[form constants]]", probably enhanced by [[psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] [[psychoactive drug|drugs]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Phosphenes were used as a learning technique by French scientist and scholar, [[Francis Lefebure]]—this is called "phosphenism".{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}
