'''Prednisolone''' is a synthetic [[glucocorticoid]], a derivative of [[cortisol]], which is used to treat a variety of [[inflammation|inflammatory]] and [[auto-immune]] conditions. It is the [[active metabolite]] of the drug [[prednisone]]<ref name="Davis">{{cite journal

==Uses==
Prednisolone is a [[corticosteroid]] drug with predominant [[glucocorticoid]] and low [[mineralocorticoid]] activity, making it useful for the treatment of a wide range of inflammatory and [[auto-immune]] conditions<ref>Czock D, Keller F, Rasche FM, Häussler U.

PMID 19131851</ref> [[cluster headaches]], [[vasculitis]], [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] and [[autoimmune hepatitis]],<ref>Lambrou GI, Vlahopoulos S, Papathanasiou C, Papanikolaou M, Karpusas M, Zoumakis E, Tzortzatou-Stathopoulou F.

It is also used for treatment of [[sarcoidosis]], though the mechanism is unknown.

'''Prednisolone acetate''' ophthalmic suspension (eye drops) is an adrenocortical steroid product, prepared as a sterile ophthalmic suspension and used to reduce swelling, redness, itching, and allergic reactions affecting the eye.

Prednisolone can also be used as an [[immunosuppressive]] drug for [[organ transplants]] and in cases of adrenal insufficiency ([[Addison's disease]]).

Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and, it is presumed, delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of [[collagen]], and scar formation  with inflammation.

==Mechanism of action==
Prednisolone irreversibly binds with [[glucocorticoid receptor]]s (GR) alpha and beta for which they have a high affinity. AlphaGR and BetaGR are found in virtually all tissues  with variable numbers between 3000 and 10000 per cell, depending on the tissue involved. Prednisolone can activate and influence biochemical behaviour of most cells. The steroid/receptor complexes dimerise and interact with cellular DNA in the nucleus, binding to steroid-response elements and modifying gene transcription. They induce synthesis of some proteins, and inhibit synthesis of others.<ref>Prednisolone. Australian Medicines Handbook 2010. Adelaide: Australian Medicines handbook Pty Ltd.; 2010. 497, 598.</ref><ref>Rang HP, Dale MM, Ritter JM, Moore PK. The pituitary and the adrenal Cortex. Hunter l, editor. Pharmacology. 5th ed. London: Churchill Livingstone; 2003. 413, 415.</ref>

Not all metabolic actions on genes are known.  Most mediator proteins are enzymes, e.g., cAMP-dependent kinase

Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions:
*Inhibition of gene transcription for [[Cyclooxygenase-2|COX-2]], cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, and [[inducible NO synthase]]
*Blockage of Vit D3-mediated induction of osteocalcin gene in [[osteoblasts]]
*Modification of collegenase gene transcription
*Increase synthesis annexin-1, important in negative feedback on [[hypothalamus]] and [[anterior pituitary gland]]

Regulation of gene suppression leads to systemic suppression of inflammation and immune response. This is of clinical usefulness but ultimately leads to [[gluconeogenesis]], proteolysis and lipolysis. Gene transcription returns to normal after cessation, but sudden stoppage can cause Addison's disease. Osteoporosis is permanent.

==Adverse effects==
{{Refimprove|date=June 2011}}
Possible side-effects include [[fluid retention]] of the face (moon face, [[Cushing's syndrome]]), [[acne]], [[constipation]], and [[mood swings]].

A lengthy course of prednisolone can cause bloody or black tarry stools from bleeding into the stomach (this requires urgent medical attention); filling or rounding out of the face; muscle cramps or pain; muscle weakness; [[nausea]]; pain in back, hips, ribs, arms, shoulders, or legs; reddish-purple [[stretch marks]] on arms, face, legs, trunk, or groin; thin and shiny skin; unusual bruising; urinating at night; rapid weight gain; and wounds that will not heal.

Prolonged use of prednisolone can lead to the development of [[osteoporosis]] which makes bones more fragile and susceptible to fractures. One way to help alleviate this side effect is through the use of [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] supplements.<ref>{{Cite web |title= prednisolone, Pediapred Oral Liquid, Medrol (cont.) | url = http://www.medicinenet.com/prednisolone/page2.htm }}</ref>

Swelling of the [[pancreas]] has also been reported.<ref name="Drugs Information">{{cite web|last=Drugs Information|title=Prednisolone Tablets 1mg, 5mg (Actavis UK Ltd)|url=http://www.drugs.com/uk/prednisolone-tablets-1mg-5mg-actavis-uk-ltd-1116.html|accessdate=13 December 2012}}</ref>

Prednisolone can cause increased blood sugar levels for [[diabetes|diabetics]].

Other effects include decreased or blurred vision, increased eye pressure, increased thirst, cataract formation, confusion, rare cases of [[dementia]] in otherwise-healthy elderly patients, and nervousness.

[[Loteprednol]] is an analog drug that has reduced adverse ocular effects.

Prednisolone may cause serious mental health problems, these affect around 5% who take such [[steroids]].<ref name="Drugs Information"/> Symptoms include:
* [[Depression (mood)|depression]], including suicidal thoughts
* feeling high ([[mania]]) or mood swings
* [[anxiety]]
* [[insomnia]]
* difficulty in thinking / [[confusion]]
* [[memory loss]]
* [[visual hallucinations|visual]], [[Auditory hallucination|auditory]] or tactile hallucinations
* having strange and frightening thoughts, changing behaviour or having feelings of being alone

Nasal septum perforation and bowel perforation are also notable adverse effects that restrict steroids' use in some pathologic conditions.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1347010/ "Bowel Perforation in Steroid-Treated Patients"]</ref><ref>[http://www.rhinologyjournal.com/Rhinology_issues/128_132_Crevin.pdf "Intranasal steroids and septum perforation"]</ref>

Withdrawal from Prednisolone can be problematic after taking large doses or over more than two weeks.<ref name="Steroid Withdrawal">{{cite web|last=Kaminstein|first=David|title=Steroid Withdrawal|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/steroid_withdrawal/page3.htm|publisher=medicinenet|accessdate=23 December 2012}}</ref> This is caused by Prednisolone inhibiting the natural production of corticosteroids in the "Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis" (HPAA)<ref name="Steroid Withdrawal"/>

==Banned status in athletics==

As a glucocorticosteroid, use of prednisolone during competition via oral, intravenous, intramuscular or rectal routes is banned under [[World Anti-Doping Agency|WADA]] anti-doping rules.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The 2011 Prohibited List | url = http://www.wada-ama.org/en/World-Anti-Doping-Program/Sports-and-Anti-Doping-Organizations/International-Standards/Prohibited-List/The-2011-Prohibited-List/Prohibited-In-Competition/ }}</ref> Local or topical use of prednisolone during competition as well as any use out of competition is not regulated.
