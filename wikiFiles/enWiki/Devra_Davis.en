==Controversies==

Tackling publicly sensitive topics from tobacco, to asbestos to overuse of diagnostic radiation, Davis has been charged with junk science, especially for raising concerns about cellphone safety and climate change. She publicly criticized the prominent epidemiologist Richard Doll, noting in her book ''The Secret History of the War on Cancer'' that his work discovering the link between tobacco and lung cancer in 1955 had been influenced by earlier German studies in the 1930s that he had not acknowledged. Richard Horton, editor of ''The Lancet'', reviewed Davis' work favorably in a lengthy analysis, taking great exception to her critique of Doll in the New York Review of Books. See: http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2008/mar/06/cancer-malignant-maneuvers/

Other public health critics have defended Davis' analysis, noting that Doll had a long career of taking money from industry without acknowledging this. See: http://www.slingshotpublications.com/conflicts.html
