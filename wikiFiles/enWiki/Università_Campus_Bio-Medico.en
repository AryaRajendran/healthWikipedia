The '''Campus Bio-Medico University''' ({{lang-it|Università Campus Bio-Medico}}, UNICAMPUS) is a university located in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. It was founded in 1991 and is organized in 2 Faculties.

==Organization==
These are the 2 faculties in which the university is divided into:

* Faculty of [[Engineering]]
* Faculty of [[Medicine]]

They confer the Degree in [[Medicine]] (6 years), the Degree in [[Nursing]] (3 years), the Degree for [[Dietician]]s (3 years), the Degree in [[Nutrition science|Science of alimentation]] (5 years) and the Degree plus Master in [[Biomedical Engineering]] (5 years).

The Campus has been thought as an international centre of university education, health service and scientific research that may ensure the respect for the sick person’s dignity.

The main purpose of the Institution is to provide the students with adequate scientific knowledge and enable them to contribute to the progress of technology and health care, always striving to ensure a compassionate, patient-centred environment.

The establishment of a university nursing program is a response to the need to endow the nurses with high scientific knowledge and to acknowledge their skills and responsibilities.

The Degree in [[Biomedical Engineering]] is closely related to the Faculty of [[Medicine]]: a modern hospital is provided with complex technological equipment for diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation whose design, use and technical assistance require the specific competence of biomedical engineers.

The University is characterized by a limited number of students and a close student-teacher relationship. An intense tutorial activity ensures a constant assistance to the students who are helped throughout the university career to develop their values and abilities.

The University Hospital Campus Bio-Medico is close to the didactic seat. It includes an out patients Clinic, a day-hospital unit, operating theatres, unities of intensive care, and departments for in-patients ([[cardiology]], [[gastroenterology]], [[gynaecology]], [[heart surgery]], [[hematology]], [[immunology]], [[medicine]], [[oncology]], [[ophthalmology]], [[orthopaedics]], [[otorhinolaryngology]], [[senology]], [[surgery]] (including [[plastic surgery]]), [[urology]]).

The doctrinal and spiritual formation is entrusted to the Prelature of [[Opus Dei]].
