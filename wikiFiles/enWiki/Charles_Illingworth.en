Sir '''Charles Frederick William Illingworth''' (8 May 1899 – 23 February 1991) was a British surgeon who specialised in [[gastroenterology]]. Along with a range of teaching and research interests, he authored several surgical textbooks, and played a leading role in university and medical administration.

Born in West Yorkshire, he served as a fighter pilot in the First World War before resuming medical studies in Edinburgh. After working and teaching in the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]] in the 1920s and 1930s, Illingworth was appointed [[Regius Professor of Surgery, Glasgow]], in 1939. Over the next 25 years, he established the Glasgow School of surgery, with generations of his students influencing surgical research and teaching in Britain and abroad. His textbooks were also highly influential, including his co-authorship of ''Text Book of Surgical Pathology'' (1932). Illingworth travelled and lectured widely, and helped initiate and present a 1963 television series on postgraduate medical training. His research included early work in the 1960s on [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]].

Illingworth's administrative and leadership roles included his Presidency of the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow]] (1962 to 1964) and Dean of Faculties at the [[University of Glasgow]] (1978 to 1981). His honours included a knighthood (1961), Honorary Surgeon to the Queen in Scotland (1961 to 1965), and a range of honorary degrees. Honorary fellowships included those conferred by the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]], the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]], and the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]]. For his devotion to surgical science, Illingworth was awarded the 1964 [[Lister Medal]].

In retirement, Illingworth wrote biographies of [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]] and [[Hector Hetherington]]. He also helped established the charity Tenovus-Scotland in 1967, and was awarded the [[Nuffield Trust]]'s Rock Carling Fellowship for 1970. Portraits of Illingworth by [[Alberto Morrocco]] are held at the [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery]] and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, and the annual Illingworth Prize for medical students is administered by the University of Glasgow. Illingworth's autobiography, ''There is a History in All Men's Lives'', was published in 1988.

==Professor of Surgery (Glasgow)==
It was in 1939, with the country facing the upheaval and uncertainties of the Second World War, that Illingworth moved from Edinburgh to take up the role of [[Regius Professor of Surgery, Glasgow]]. He was appointed to this Chair during the leadership of that university by [[Hector Hetherington]], and would hold this position for 25 years from 1939 to 1964.<ref name="UGWWW">{{cite book|title=Who, Where and When: The History & Constitution of the University of Glasgow|last1=Moss|first1=Michael|last2=Rankin|first2=Moira|last3=Richmond|first3=Lesley|year=2001|publisher=University of Glasgow|ISBN=0 85261 734 8}}</ref> Illingworth, who arrived at a low point in the history of the faculty, worked to raise and re-establish the status of the [[University of Glasgow Medical School]], playing "a major role in establishing the University's high reputation in the practice and teaching of surgery after the Second World War".<ref>{{cite web|title=University of Glasgow Story: People: Sir Charles Illingworth|publisher=University of Glasgow|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH0233&type=P|accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref> According to the [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]: "Under Illingworth's leadership, the Glasgow school achieved worldwide renown for excellence in the practice and teaching of medicine and surgery, and also in research".<ref name="ODNB"/>

Illingworth continued to write on surgical methods, with revisions to existing works along with the publication of new textbooks. ''Text Book of Surgical Treatment'' (1942) would be issued in a fourth edition in 1952.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2480022/pdf/ulstermedj00163-0134b.pdf|format=pdf|journal=Ulster Medical Journal|title=Textbook of Surgical Treatment|PMC=2480022|year=1952|month=November|volume=21|issue=2|page=198}}</ref> He was also awarded lectureships and travelled abroad during this period, such as when he delivered the 1958 Strauss Lecture under the title 'The Endocrine Aspects of Breast Cancer'.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://depts.washington.edu/uwsurgap/strauss.htm| title=Strauss Lectures| publisher=University of Washington School of Medicine| accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> In 1960, Illingworth was the first McLaughlin Foundation-Edward Gallie Visiting Professor, in which capacity he visited several universities and hospitals in Canada to teach and lecture.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Canadian visit: report of the First McLaughlin-Gallie Professorship|last=Illingworth|first=C.

Illingworth's support of medical training extended beyond the traditional settings of universities and medical schools, and included the use of the medium of television. In 1963, he and his colleagues introduced a series of television programmes for doctors on [[Scottish Television]]. There were twelve episodes in the series (titled 'Post-Graduate Medicine'), broadcast monthly from 11 March 1963: "for hospital doctors and general practitioners and [...] in the nature of a post-graduate class".<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=TV Programme as Aid to Doctors |day_of_week=Saturday |date=23 February 1963 |page_number= 10 |issue= 55633|column=}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The first programme (which Illingworth introduced) was 30 minutes long and broadcast late in the evening just after 11pm.<ref>{{cite news|title=Television and Radio Programmes|date=11 March 1963|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|page=14|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jWxAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=j6MMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3577,1471644}}</ref> Two photographs of Illingworth from 1963 in the episode 'Peptic Ulcer: A Surgeon Cross-Questioned' from this series were published in a history of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Shaping of the Medical Profession: The History of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, 1858-1999, Volume 2|last1=Hull|first1=Andrew|last2=Geyer-Kordesch|first2=Johanna|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1999|at=photographs 12 and 13 between pp.96-97}}</ref>|group="n"}} In addition to these new methods, Illingworth continued his lecturing and teaching, and in 1963 was appointed a visiting professor at the University of Sheffield. Over the course of a week in November of that year, he lectured to both the public, students and fellow doctors, and delivered the Ernest Finch Memorial Lecture in memory of Sir [[Ernest Finch]].<ref name="SheffieldBelfast">{{cite news|title=Travelling Surgeon|date=22 July 1963|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|page=6|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lG5AAAAAIBAJ&sjid=i6MMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5135,3115809}}</ref> In 1964, Illingworth formally retired from hospital work. His retirement as Regius Professor of Surgery at the University of Glasgow was announced in December 1963 in the London Gazette by the [[Scottish Home and Health Department]], along with the news of his appointed successor [[Andrew Watt Kay]], though the retirement did not take effect until the following year on 30 September 1964.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=43180 |date=10 December 1963 |startpage=10099}}</ref>

==Society and university administration==
As well as practising, teaching and administrating as Glasgow's Regius Professor of Surgery, Illingworth also held positions within the hierarchies of a range of medical and learned societies, colleges and associations. In 1955 he was President of the [[Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.asgbi.org.uk/en/about_asgbi/history/asgbi_past_presidents.cfm| title=ASGBI Past Presidents| publisher=Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland| accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> and President for two terms of the [[Society of Academic and Research Surgery]] (1956 and 1957).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://surgicalresearch.org.uk/council/past-presidents-and-honorary-secretaries/| title=Past Presidents and Honorary Secretaries| publisher=Society of Academic and Research Surgery| accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|It was the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland that had sent Illingworth to the USA on a travelling fellowship nearly 30 years previously.|group="n"}}

In the early 1960s, Illingworth played a central role in the history of the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow]], or the Glasgow Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons as it was then known. From 1960 to 1962 he served two annual terms of that organisation's Visitorship,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Shaping of the Medical Profession: The History of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, 1858-1999, Volume 2|last1=Hull|first1=Andrew|last2=Geyer-Kordesch|first2=Johanna|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2003|page=250|edition=2nd|chapter=Office Bearers}}</ref> followed from 1962 to 1964 by two annual terms as President of what was by then called the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Shaping of the Medical Profession: The History of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, 1858-1999, Volume 2|last1=Hull|first1=Andrew|last2=Geyer-Kordesch|first2=Johanna|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2003|page=246|edition=2nd|chapter=Office Bearers}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|A photograph of Illingworth in 1962 as President at the centre of a formal group portrait of Council members was published in a history of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Shaping of the Medical Profession: The History of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, 1858-1999, Volume 2|last1=Hull|first1=Andrew|last2=Geyer-Kordesch|first2=Johanna|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1999|at=photograph 14 between pp.96-97}}</ref>|group="n"}} It was during this period, in 1963, that Illingworth was granted the title of Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Glasgow (FRCSGlas).<ref name="WhoWasWho"/> This award followed the recent name change (instigated by Illingworth's predecessor as President) that changed the Glasgow Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons from a Faculty to a Royal College.{{#tag:ref|While a number of changes occurred to the levels of memberships and fellowships relating to physicians, the award of FRCSGlas remained unchanged.|group="n"}} This period also saw attempts made to standardise and consolidate the range of diplomas offered across the UK medical colleges, with some of these changes proposed and debated by Illingworth during his leadership of the College.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Shaping of the Medical Profession: The History of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, 1858-1999, Volume 2|last1=Hull|first1=Andrew|last2=Geyer-Kordesch|first2=Johanna|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2003|pages=192–197|edition=2nd|chapter=The Royal College 1960-1972}}</ref>

The following year, furthering his contributions to administration, Illingworth was one of those organising the Lister Centenary events held in Glasgow from 26 to 29 September 1965; he was also involved in appeals to raise funds during the commemorative period.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Good Response To Lister Appeal|day_of_week=Tuesday |date=28 September 1965 |page_number=12 |issue=56438|column=}}</ref> The celebrations saw delegates from around the world attending a two-day scientific meeting arranged by Illingworth at the [[University of Glasgow]]. The conclusion of the event included a graduation ceremony on 29 September 1965 when honorary degrees were conferred on "twelve eminent medical men from various countries", including Illingworth himself who received an Honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] (LL.D.) degree.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Glasgow Degrees Ceremony|day_of_week=Thursday |date=30 September 1965 |page_number=14 |issue=56440|column=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |year=1965 |month=November |title=Lister Centenary |journal=Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=322–324 |pmc=2311866}}</ref> A few days later, a similar event was held to celebrate the Moynihan Centenary at the [[University of Leeds]]. Illingworth again received an Honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) degree along with three others (Sir [[Harry Platt]], [[Russell Brock, Baron Brock|Lord Brock]], [[Jan Nuboer]]), with the ceremony taking place on 4 October 1965.

As a recognised elder statesman of his profession, more honorary fellowships followed. One such had been conferred earlier in the year when Illingworth was made an Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]], together with two other surgeons: Sir [[Arthur Porritt]] and Erik Husfeldt.<ref>{{cite news|title=Three Surgeons Honoured|date=18 February 1964|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|page=10|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=v4NAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=r6MMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2242,6933425}}</ref> In 1965, Illingworth was invited by the Council of the College of Physicians, Surgeons and Gynaecologists of South Africa to give the 1965 Louis Mirvish Memorial Lecture.

==Retirement and legacy==
Following his retirement in 1964, Illingworth held the title of Emeritus Professor of Surgery at the University of Glasgow, and continued to carry out locum work into his seventies. In these later years, he still travelled and lectured, with plans reported in August 1966 for a three-month stay in Kenya to co-ordinate planning in a new medical school.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bound for Kenya|date=2 August 1966|newspaper=Evening Times|page=5|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cuhAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RacMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1982,155792}}</ref> He gave the 14th MacEwen Memorial Lecture at the University of Glasgow on 21 November 1967, under the title 'The Advancement of Surgery'.<ref name="UGWWW"/><ref>Published the following year and reviewed in {{cite journal|title=The Advancement of Surgery.

Two biographies by Illingworth were published in this period. ''The Story of William Hunter'' (1967) is a first-person account and history of the 18th-century Scottish anatomist [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]]. A review in ''Medical History'' stated that: <blockquote>"William Hunter has been neglected by medical historians in comparison with his brother John. Sir Charles Illingworth's book has done much to make good this deficiency and will, it is hoped, reawaken interest in him, not only as one of the leading gynaecologists of the eighteenth century but also as a pioneer in the promotion of reform and improvement in medical education."<ref>{{cite journal|title=Book Reviews: The Story of William Hunter, by Charles Illingworth, Edinburgh and London, E. & S.

Illingworth's ''University Statesman: Sir Hector Hetherington'' (1971) was excerpted in ''The Glasgow Herald'',<ref>{{cite news|title=Hector Hetherington - III: Vintage years as Principal at Gilmorehill|date=12 June 1971|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|page=15|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=znxAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lKMMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3779,3135153}}</ref> and reviewed in ''[[The Economist]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Outram|first=George|title=Long time passing|journal=The Economist|date=4 September 1971|page=48|issue=6680}}</ref>

Illingworth continued to write on healthcare training and reform, writing the monograph ''The Sanguine Mystery'' (1970), subtitled: This Bloody and Butcherly Department of the Healing Art.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Sanguine Mystery: This Bloody and Butcherly Department of the Healing Art|last=Illingworth|first=Charles Frederick William|publisher=Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust|year=1970|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?&id=ZZwwAAAAIAAJ}}</ref> This work was produced for his Rock Carling Fellowship, also forming the topic of the Rock Carling Lecture for 1970 from the [[Nuffield Trust]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust Ninth Report|publisher=Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust|year=1975|page=66}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The Rock Carling Fellowship was founded as a memorial to Ernest Rock Carling (1877-1960), one of the Trustees of the Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust.<ref>For more on the Rock Carling Fellowship, see {{cite web|title=The Rock Carling Fellowship|publisher=The Nuffield Trust|url=http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/get-involved/rock-carling-fellowship|accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref>|group="n"}} An article by Illingworth on medical training was published in ''The Times'' in July 1971.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |author=Illingworth, Charles Frederick William|articlename=The Case for Taking Another Look at Training System|day_of_week=Tuesday |date=27 July 1971 |page_number=I |issue=58235|column=}}</ref> The death of his wife Mary (Lady Illingworth) was announced in ''The Glasgow Herald'' in December of that year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Death of Lady Mary Illingworth|date=29 December 1971|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|page=15|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d-A9AAAAIBAJ&sjid=SEgMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3760,2568662}}</ref>

Many years later, Illingworth published an autobiographical account of his life, with royalties going to the Tenovus-Scotland charity he had helped found. Titled ''There is a History in All Men's Lives'' (1988),{{#tag:ref|The title is a quote from Shakespeare's [[Henry IV, Part 2]].|group="n"}} it had been previewed in ''The Glasgow Herald'' in December 1987,<ref>{{cite news|title=Carving a Surgical Career|date=24 December 1987|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|page=8|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8DhAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LlkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6656,6379827}}</ref> and was reviewed in the ''British Medical Journal'' in April 1988.<ref>{{cite journal |date=9 April 1988 |title=Medicine and Books: In brief... |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=296 |issue=6628 |page=1062 |pmc=2545573}}</ref> Three years later, Illingworth died on 23 February 1991 in Glasgow at the age of 91.<ref name="ODNB"/>
