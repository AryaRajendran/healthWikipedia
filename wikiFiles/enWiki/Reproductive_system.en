The '''reproductive system''' or '''genital system''' is a system of [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] within an [[organism]] which work together for the purpose of [[reproduction]]. Many non-living substances such as fluids, [[hormone]]s, and [[pheromone]]s are also important accessories to the reproductive system.<ref>[http://training.seer.cancer.gov/module_anatomy/unit12_1_repdt_intro.html  Introduction to the Reproductive System.] , Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program.</ref> Unlike most organ systems, the [[gender|sexes]] of [[sexual differentiation|differentiated]] [[species]] often have significant differences. These differences allow for a combination of genetic material between two individuals, which allows for the possibility of greater [[genes|genetic]] [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of the [[offspring]].<ref name=Adam>[http://www.besthealth.com/besthealth/bodyguide/reftext/html/repr_sys_fin.html  Reproductive System 2001] Body Guide powered by Adam</ref>

In mammals, the major organs of the reproductive system include the external [[genitalia]] (penis and vulva) as well as a number of internal organs including the [[gamete]] producing [[gonad]]s (testicles and ovaries). Diseases of the human reproductive system are very common and widespread, particularly [[Infectious disease|communicable]] [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.<ref>[http://www.cdcnpin.org/scripts/std/std.asp#2 STD's Today] National Prevention Network, Center for Disease Control, United States Government, retrieving 2007</ref>

Most other [[vertebrate]] animals have generally similar reproductive systems consisting of gonads, ducts, and openings. However, there is a great diversity of physical [[adaptation]]s as well as [[Reproduction|reproductive strategies]] in every group of vertebrates.

==Vertebrates==
{{See also|Sexual reproduction}}
[[Vertebrate]] [[animal]]s all share key elements of their reproductive systems. They all have gamete producing organs or [[gonad]]s. In females, these gonads are then connected by [[oviduct]]s to an opening to the outside of the body, typically the cloaca, but sometime to a unique pore such as a [[vagina]] or [[intromittent organ]].

=== Mammals ===

[[File:Joey in pouch.jpg|thumb|A newborn [[Joey (marsupial)|joey]] [[suckles]] from a [[teat]] found within its mother's [[Pouch (marsupial)|pouch]]]]
Most [[mammal]] reproductive systems are similar, however, there are some notable differences between the "normal" mammal and humans. For instance, most mammalian males [[mammal penis|have a penis]] which is stored internally until erect, and most have a penis bone or [[baculum]]. Additionally, males of most species do not remain continually [[sexually fertile]] as humans do. Like humans, most groups of mammals have descended testicles found within a scrotum, however, others have descended testicles that rest on the ventral body wall, and a few groups of mammals, such as elephants, have undescended testicles found deep within their body cavities near their [[kidney]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Werdelin L, Nilsonne A |title=The evolution of the scrotum and testicular descent in mammals: a phylogenetic view |journal=J. Theor. Biol. |volume=196 |issue=1 |pages=61–72 |year=1999 |month=January |pmid=9892556 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.1998.0821 |url=}}</ref><ref>[http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/descent_of_the_testicle/ Descent of the testicles.] P.Z. Myers. Pharyngula blog. 2004.</ref>

[[Marsupial]]s are unique in that the female has two vaginae, both of which open externally through one orifice but lead to different compartments within the uterus; males usually have a [[Marsupial penis|two-pronged penis]] which corresponds to the females' two vaginae. Marsupials typically develop their offspring in an external [[Pouch (marsupial)|pouch]] containing [[teat]]s to which their newborn young ([[Joey (marsupial)|joey]]s) attach themselves for post uterine development. Also, marsupials have a unique prepenial scrotum.<ref>{{cite book |author=Renfree, Marilyn; Tyndale-Biscoe, C.

The uterus and vagina are unique to mammals with no homologue in birds, reptiles, amphibians, or fish.<ref name= pharangula>[http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/evolution_of_the_mammalian_vagina/P75/ Evolution of the mammalian vagina.] P.Z. Myers. Pharyngula blog. Tuesday, November 01, 2005.</ref> In place of the uterus the other [[vertebrate]] groups have an unmodified oviduct leading directly to a [[cloaca]], which is a shared exit-hole for gametes, [[urine]], and [[feces]]. Monotremes (i.e. [[platypus]] and [[echidna]]s), a group of egg-laying mammals, also lack a uterus and vagina, and in that respect have a reproductive system resembling that of a reptile.

==== Human reproductive system ====
{{Further|Human reproduction}}
[[Human reproduction]] takes place as [[internal fertilization]] by [[sexual intercourse]].  During this process, the [[erection|erect]] [[penis]] of the [[male]] is inserted into the [[female|female's]] [[vagina]] until the male [[ejaculate]]s [[semen]], which contains [[sperm]], into the female's vagina. The sperm then travels through the vagina and cervix into the [[uterus]] or [[fallopian tube]]s for fertilization of the [[ovum]]. Upon successful [[human fertilization|fertilization]] and implantation, [[gestation]] of the [[fetus]] then occurs within the female's uterus for approximately nine months, this process is known as [[pregnancy]] in humans. Gestation ends with [[birth]], the process of birth is known as labor. Labor consists of the [[muscle]]s of the uterus contracting, the [[cervical dilation|cervix dilating]], and the baby passing out the vagina (the female genital organ). Human's babies and children are nearly helpless and require high levels of [[parental care]] for many years. One important type of parental care is the use of the [[mammary gland]]s in the female [[breast]]s to [[lactation|nurse]] the baby.<ref>[http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/S/Sexual_Reproduction.html Sexual Reproduction in Humans.] 2006. John W. Kimball. Kimball's Biology Pages, and online textbook.</ref>

The female reproductive system has two functions: The first is to produce egg cells, and the second is to protect and nourish the offspring until birth. The male reproductive system has one function, and it is to produce and deposit sperm. Humans have a high level of [[sexual differentiation]]. In addition to differences in nearly every reproductive organ, numerous differences typically occur in [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s.

=====Male reproductive system=====
{{main|Human male reproductive system}}
The human male reproductive system is a series of organs located outside of the body and around the [[pelvis|pelvic]] region of a [[male]] that contribute towards the [[Reproduction|reproductive]] process. The primary direct function of the male reproductive system is to provide the male [gamete] or [spermatozoa] for fertilization of the ovum. 

The major reproductive organs of the male can be grouped into three categories. The first category is sperm production and storage. Production takes place in the [[testes]] which are housed in the temperature regulating [[scrotum]], immature sperm then travel to the [[epididymis]] for development and storage. The second category are the ejaculatory fluid producing glands which include the [[seminal vesicles]], [[prostate]], and the [[vas deferens]]. The final category are those used for copulation, and deposition of the [[spermatozoa]] ([[sperm]]) within the male, these include the [[penis]], [[urethra]], [[vas deferens]], and [[Cowper's gland]].

Major secondary sexual characteristics includes: larger, more muscular stature, deepened voice, [[facial hair|facial]] and [[body hair]], broad shoulders, and development of an [[adam's apple]]. An important sexual hormone of males is [[androgen]], and particularly [[testosterone]].<ref name="kimball">[http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/S/SexHormones.html Hormones of the Reproductive System] 2006. John W. Kimball. Kimball's Biology Pages, and online textbook.</ref>

The testes release a hormone that controls the development of sperm. This hormone is also responsible for the development of physical characteristics in men such as facial hair and a deep voice.

=====Female reproductive system=====
{{main|Human female reproductive system}}

The human female reproductive system is a series of organs primarily located inside of the body and around the [[pelvis|pelvic]] region of a [[female]] that contribute towards the [[Reproduction|reproductive]] process. The human female reproductive system contains three main parts: the [[vagina]], which leads from the vulva, the vaginal opening, to the uterus; the [[uterus]], which holds the developing fetus; and the [[Ovary|ovaries]], which produce the female's ova. The [[breast]]s are involved during the parenting stage of reproduction, but in most classifications they are not considered to be part of the female reproductive system. 

The vagina meets the outside at the [[vulva]], which also includes the [[labia (genitalia)|labia]], [[clitoris]] and [[urethra]]; during intercourse this area is lubricated by mucus secreted by the [[Bartholin's glands]]. The vagina is attached to the uterus through the [[cervix]], while the uterus is attached to the ovaries via the [[fallopian tubes]]. Each ovary contains hundreds of egg cells or ova (singular ''[[ovum]]''). 

Approximately [[Menstrual cycle|every 28 days]], the [[pituitary gland]] releases a [[hormone]] that stimulates some of the ova to develop and grow. One ovum is released and it passes through the fallopian tube into the uterus. Hormones produced by the ovaries prepare the uterus to receive the ovum.  The lining of the uterus, called the [[endometrium]], and unfertilized ova are shed each cycle through the process of [[menstruation]]. If the ovum is fertilized by sperm, it attaches to the endometrium and the fetus develops.

===== Production of gametes=====
{{main|Spermatogenesis|Oogenesis}}
The production of gametes takes place within the gonads through a process known as [[gametogenesis]]. Gametogenesis occurs when certain types of [[germ cell]]s undergo [[meiosis]] to split the normal diploid number of [[chromosome]](n=46) into haploids cells containing only 23 chromosomes.<ref name=sexcell>[http://www.besthealth.com/besthealth/bodyguide/reftext/html/repr_sys_fin.html#development Development of sex cells] in Reproductive system, Body Guide. Adam.</ref>

In males, this process is known as [[spermatogenesis]] and takes place only after [[puberty]] in the [[seminiferous tubules]] of the testes. The immature [[spermatozoon]] or sperm are then sent to the [[epididymis]] where they gain a tail and [[motility]]. Each of the original diploid germs cells or primary [[spermatocyte]]s forms four functional gametes which is each forever young. The production and survival of sperms require a temperature that is lower than the normal core body temperature. Since the scrotum, where the testes is present, is situated outside the body cavity, it provides a temperature about 3°C below normal body temperature.

In females, gametogenesis is known as [[oogenesis]] which occurs in the [[ovarian follicle]]s of the ovaries. This process does not produce mature ovum until puberty. In contrast with males, each of the original diploid germ cells or primary [[oocyte]]s will form only one mature ovum, and three [[polar body|polar bodies]] which are not capable of fertilization It has long been understood that in females, unlike males, all of the primary [[oocyte]]s ever found in a female will be created prior to [[birth]], and that the final stages of ova production will then not resume until puberty.<ref name=sexcell /> However, recent scientific data has challenged that hypothesis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tilly JL, Niikura Y, Rueda BR |title=The Current Status of Evidence for and Against Postnatal Oogenesis in Mammals: A Case of Ovarian Optimism Versus Pessimism? |journal=Biol. Reprod. |volume= 80|issue= 1|pages= 2–12|year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18753611 |doi=10.1095/biolreprod.108.069088 |url= |pmc=2804806}}</ref> This new data indicates that in at least some species of mammal oocytes continue to be replenished in females well after birth.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Johnson J, Canning J, Kaneko T, Pru JK, Tilly JL |title=Germline stem cells and follicular renewal in the postnatal mammalian ovary |journal=Nature |volume=428 |issue=6979 |pages=145–50 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15014492 |doi=10.1038/nature02316 |url=}}</ref>

=====Development of the reproductive system=====
{{main|Development of the urinary and reproductive organs}}
The development of the reproductive system and [[urinary system]]s are closely tied in the [[prenatal development|development]] of the human fetus. Despite the differences between the [[adult]] male and female reproductive system, there are a number of [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] structures shared between them due to their common origins within the fetus. Both organ systems are derived from the [[intermediate mesoderm]]. The three main fetal precursors of the reproductive organs are the [[Wolffian duct]], [[Müllerian ducts]], and the [[gonad]]. [[endocrine system|Endocrine]] hormones are a well known and critical controlling factor in the normal differentiation of the reproductive system.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/endocrine/inventory/RTD-KELC.html EDRI Federal Project Inventory: Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Abnormal Reproductive Development] US EPA. Dr. William R. Kelce.  2006.</ref>

The Wolffian duct forms the epididymis, vas deferens, ductus deferens, [[ejaculatory duct]], and seminal vesicle in the male reproductive system and essentially disappears in the female reproductive system. For the Müllerian Duct this process is reversed as it essentially disappears in the male reproductive system and forms the fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina in the female system. In both sexes the gonad  goes on to form the testes and ovaries, because they are derived from the same undeveloped structure they are considered [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] organs. There are a number of other homologous structures shared between male and female reproductive systems. However, despite the similarity in function of the female fallopian tubes and the male epididymis and vas deferens, they are not homologous but rather [[analogy (biology)|analogous]] structures as they arise from different fetal structures.

=====Diseases of the human reproductive system=====
{{main|Reproductive system disease}}
Like all complex organ systems the human reproductive system is affected by many diseases. There are four main categories of reproductive [[disease]]s in humans. They are: 1) genetic or [[congenital abnormalities]], 2) [[cancer]]s, 3) [[infection]]s which are often [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, and 4) functional problems cause by [[environmental factor]]s, physical damage, psychological issues,  [[autoimmune disorder]]s, or other causes. The best known type of functional problems include [[sexual dysfunction]] and [[infertility]] which are both broad terms relating to many disorders with many causes.

Specific reproductive diseases are often [[symptom]]s of other diseases and [[disease|disorders]], or have multiple, or unknown causes making them difficult to classify. Examples of unclassifiable disorders include [[Peyronie's disease]] in males and [[endometriosis]] in females. Many congenital conditions cause reproductive abnormalities but are better known for their other symptoms, these include: [[Turner syndrome]], [[Klinefelter's syndrome]], [[Cystic fibrosis]], and [[Bloom syndrome]].<ref>[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/ghr/conditionsByCategory/show/reproductivesystem Genetic Conditions > Reproductive system.] 2007. Genetics Home Reference. U.S. National Library of Medicine.</ref>

===Birds===
{{Main|Avian reproductive system}}
Male and female birds have a [[cloaca]], an opening through which eggs, sperm, and wastes pass. Intercourse is performed by pressing the lips of the cloacae together, which is sometimes knowna [[intromittent organ]] which is known as a phallus that is [[analogous]] to the [[mammal penis|mammals' penis]]. The female lays [[amniote|amniotic]] eggs in which the young fetus continues to develop after it leaves the female's body.  Unlike most vertebrates female birds typically have only one functional ovary and [[oviduct]].<ref>Ritchison. BIO 554/754 Ornithology. Eastern Kentucky University.</ref> As a group, birds, like mammals, are noted for their high level of parental care.

=== Reptiles ===
{{Main|Reptiles#Reproduction}}
[[Reptiles]] are almost all [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]], and exhibit internal fertilization through the cloaca. Some reptiles lay [[egg (biology)|egg]]s while others are viviparous (animals that deliver live young). Reproductive organs are found within the cloaca of reptiles. Most male reptiles have copulatory organs, which are usually retracted or inverted and stored inside the body. In turtles and crocodilians, the male has a single median penis-like organ, while male snakes and lizards each possess a pair of penis-like organs.

[[File:Frog in frogspawn.jpg|thumb|right|A female [[frog]] sitting in a mass of its own [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]]]]

=== Amphibians ===
{{main|Amphibian#Reproduction}}
Most [[amphibian]]s exhibit external fertilization of eggs, typically within the water, though some amphibians such as [[caecilian]]s have internal fertilization.<ref>{{cite book |last=Grzimek |first=B. |year=1974 |title=Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia: Volume 5 Fishes II & Amphibians. |location=New York |publisher=Van Nostrand Reihnhold Co. |asin=B000HHFY52|pages=301–302}}</ref> All have paired, internal gonads, connected by ducts to the cloaca.

=== Fish ===
{{main|Fish#Reproductive_method}}
[[Fish]] exhibit a wide range of different reproductive strategies. Most fish however are [[oviparous]] and exhibit external fertilization. In this process, females use their cloaca to release large quantities of their gametes, called [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] into the water and one or more males release "milt", a white fluid containing many sperm over the unfertilized eggs. Other species of fish are oviparous and have internal fertilization aided by pelvic or anal [[fin]]s that are modified into an [[intromittent organ]] analogous to the human penis.<ref>[http://www.lookd.com/fish/reproduction.html Fish Reproduction]</ref> A small portion of fish species are either viviparous or [[ovoviviparous]], and are collectively known as [[livebearer]]s.<ref>[http://www.advancedaquarist.com/issues/june2002/breeder.htm Science, Biology, and Terminology of Fish reproduction: Reproductive modes and strategies-part 1]. 2002. MARTIN MOE. THE BREEDER'S NET Online Magazine</ref>

Fish gonads are typically pairs of either ovaries or testes. Most fish are sexually dimorphic but some species are [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] or [[unisexual]].<ref>[http://www.buschgardens.org/infobooks/BonyFish/reproduction.html Bony Fish Reproduction] 2002. SeaWorld/Busch Gardens Animal Information Database.</ref>

==Invertebrates==
{{See also|Reproductive system of gastropods}}

[[Invertebrate]]s have an extremely diverse array of reproductive systems, the only commonality may be that they all lay eggs. Also, aside from [[cephalopod]]s, and [[arthropod]]s, nearly all other invertebrates are [[hermaphroditic]] and exhibit [[external fertilization]].

===Cephalopods===
{{main|Cephalopod#Reproduction and life cycle}}
All [[cephalopod]]s are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] and reproduce by laying [[egg (biology)|egg]]s. Most cephalopods have semi-internal fertilization, in which the male places his gametes inside the female's mantle cavity or [[pallial cavity]] to fertilize the [[Ovum|ova]] found in the female's single [[ovary]].<ref>[http://www.weichtiere.at/Mollusks/Kopffuesser/haupt.html Cephalopods.] The Living World of Molluscs. Robert Nordsieck.</ref> Likewise, male cephalopods have only a single [[testicle]]. In the female of most cephalopods the [[nidamental gland]]s aid in development of the egg.

The "penis" in most unshelled male cephalopods ([[Coleoidea]]) is a long and muscular end of the gonoduct used to transfer spermatophores to a modified arm called a [[hectocotylus]]. That in turn is used to transfer the spermatophores to the female. In species where the hectocotylus is missing, the "penis" is long and able to extend beyond the mantle cavity and transfer the spermatophores directly to the female.
