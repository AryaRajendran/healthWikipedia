The '''adductor brevis''' is a muscle in the thigh situated immediately behind the [[pectineus muscle|pectineus]] and [[adductor longus muscle|adductor longus]].  It belongs to the [[Adductor muscles of the hip|adductor muscle group]].  The main function of the adductor brevis is to pull the thigh [[Anatomical terms of location#Left and right (lateral), and medial|medially]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Saladin|first=Kenneth|title=Anatomy & Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function 6th Ed.|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-337825-1}}</ref> The adductor brevis and the rest of the adductor muscle group is also used to stabilize left to right movements of the [[Trunk (anatomy)|trunk]], when standing on both feet, or to balance when standing on a moving surface.  The adductor muscle group is used pressing the [[thigh]]s together to ride a horse, and kicking with the inside of the foot in soccer or swimming.  Last, they contribute to [[flexion]] of the thigh when running or against resistance (squats, jumping, etc).<ref>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Keith|title=Clinically Oriented Anatomy 5th Ed.|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins}}</ref>

==Origin and insertion==
It is somewhat triangular in form, and arises by a narrow origin from the outer surfaces of the [[superior pubic ramus|superior]] and [[inferior pubic ramus|inferior rami]] of the [[pubis (bone)|pubis]], between the [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]] and [[obturator externus muscle|obturator externus]].

Its fibers, passing backward, lateralward, and downward, are inserted, by an aponeurosis, into the line leading from the [[lesser trochanter]] to the [[linea aspera]] and into the upper part of the linea aspera, immediately behind the [[pectineus muscle|pectineus]] and upper part of the [[adductor longus muscle|adductor longus]].

==Actions==
The muscle is primarily known as a [[hip adductor]]. It also functions as a [[hip flexor]]. Whether it acts to rotate the femur laterally or medially is dependent on position.

==Relations==
By its anterior surface, the adductor brevis is in relation with the [[pectineus muscle|pectineus]], [[adductor longus muscle|adductor longus]], and anterior branches of the [[Anterior branch of the obturator artery|obturator artery]], the [[obturator veins|obturator vein]], and the [[obturator nerve]].

By its posterior surface with the [[adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]] and the posterior branches of the [[Posterior branch of the obturator artery|obturator artery]], the obturator vein, and the obturator nerve.

By its outer border with the [[obturator externus muscle|obturator externus]], and the [[iliopsoas]].  By its inner border with the [[gracilis muscle|gracilis]] and adductor magnus.

It is pierced near its insertion by the middle [[perforating arteries|perforating artery]].

==Innervation==
The adductor brevis is innervated dually by the anterior and posterior branches of the obturator nerve.<ref>Miura M, Nakamura E, Kato S, Usui T, Miyauchi R. (1994), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7808725 ''The true nature of the adductor brevis dually innervated by the anterior and posterior branches of the obturator nerve in humans'']</ref>
