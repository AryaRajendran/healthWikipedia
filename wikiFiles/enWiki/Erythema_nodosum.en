Erythema nodosum usually resolves itself 3–6 weeks after an event, either internal or external to the body, that initiates a [[hypersensitivity]] reaction in [[subcutaneous]] fat.<ref>{{cite book | author = Ryan TJ | year = 1998 | title = Textbook of Dermatology | chapter = Cutaneous vasculitis | editor = Burns DA, Breathnach SM | edition = 6th | publisher = Blackwell Science Ltd | location = London | pages = 2155–225 | isbn = 0-632-05064-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = Camilleri MJ, Su WPD | year = 2003 | title = Fitzpatrick's Dermatology In General Medicine | chapter = Panniculitis | editor = Freedberg IM, Eisen AZ, Wolff K, Austen KF, Goldsmith LA, Katz SI | edition = 6th | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-07-138076-0}}</ref> EN is frequently associated with fever, malaise, and joint pain and inflammation. It presents as tender red nodules on the shins that are smooth and shiny. The nodules may occur anywhere there is fat under the skin, including the thighs, arms, trunk, face, and neck.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cribier B, Caille A, Heid E, Grosshans E | title = Erythema nodosum and associated diseases.

As the nodules age, they become bluish purple, brownish, yellowish, and finally green, similar to the color changes that occur in a resolving bruise. The nodules usually subside over a period of 2–6 weeks without ulceration or scarring.<ref name=.>{{cite book | author = Wolff K, Johnson RA, Suurmond R | year = 2005 | title = Fitzpatrick's Color Atlas & Synopsis of Clinical Dermatology | chapter = Section 7: Miscellaneous inflammatory disorders | edition = 5th | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-07-144019-4}}</ref>

[[Dermatophytids]] are similar skin lesions that result from a fungus infection such as [[ringworm]] in another area of the body.

==Causes==
In about 30-50% of cases, the cause of EN is unknown.<ref name="Mert">{{cite journal | author = Mert A, Ozaras R, Tabak F, Pekmezci S, Demirkesen C, Ozturk R | title = Erythema nodosum: an experience of 10 years | journal = Scand J Infect Dis | year = 2004 | pages = 424–7 | volume = 36 | issue = 6–7 | pmid = 15307561 | doi = 10.1080/00365540410027184}}</ref> EN may be associated with a wide variety of diseases, including infections (e.g., hepatitis C, [[tuberculosis]], [[Streptococcus|streptococcal]], ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Yersinia]]'', and [[Epstein-Barr virus]]), ''[[Coccidioides immitis]]'', [[sarcoidosis]], autoimmune disorders (e.g., [[inflammatory bowel disease]] or [[Behçet's disease]]), pregnancy, medications ([[sulfonamides]], oral contraceptives, bromides), vaccinations, and cancer.<ref name="Mert"/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Anan T, Imamura T, Yokoyama S, Fujiwara S | title = Erythema nodosum and granulomatous lesions preceding acute myelomonocytic leukemia | journal = J Dermatol | year = 2004 | pages = 741–7 | volume = 31 | issue = 9 | pmid = 15628321}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Bohn S, Buchner S, Itin P | title = Erythema nodosum: 112 cases.

A useful mnemonic for causes is SORE SHINS (Streptococci, OCP, Rickettsia, Eponymous (Bechet), Sulfonamides, Hansen's Disease (Leprosy), IBD, NHL, Sarcoidosis.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is clinical. A deep punch biopsy or an incisional biopsy may be performed in cases where the diagnosis is unclear. Microscopic examination will reveal a septal panniculitis with acute and chronic inflammation in the fat and around blood vessels.<ref name="." />  

Once EN is diagnosed, additional evaluation needs to be performed to determine the underlying cause. A complete blood count, [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR), [[Antistreptolysin O titre|antistreptolysin-O (ASO) titer]], [[urinalysis]], throat culture, intradermal tuberculin test, and chest x-ray are part of the initial examination.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Garcia-Porrua C, Gonzalez-Gay MA, Vazquez-Caruncho M, Lopez-Lazaro L, Lueiro M, Fernandez ML, Alvarez-Ferreira J, Pujol RM | title = Erythema nodosum: etiologic and predictive factors in a defined population | journal = Arthritis Rheum | year = 2000 | pages = 584–92 | volume = 43 | issue = 3 | pmid = 10728752 | doi = 10.1002/1529-0131(200003)43:3<584::AID-ANR15>3.0.CO;2-6}}</ref>

The ESR is initially very high, and falls as the nodules fade. The ASO titer is high in cases associated with a streptococcal throat infection. A [[chest X-ray]] should be performed to rule out [[pulmonary]] diseases. [[Hilar lymphadenopathy]] may be due to tuberculosis, [[sarcoidosis]], or [[Löfgren syndrome]]  (a form of acute sarcoidosis with erythema nodosum, bilateral hilar adenopathy, fever, and often accompanied by joint symptoms).

==Treatment==
Erythema nodosum is self limiting and usually resolves itself within 3–6 weeks. A recurring form does exist, and in children it is attributed to repeated infections with [[streptococcus]].<ref name="Robbins">{{cite book | author = Kumar V, Abbas A | title = Robbins and Coltran Pathological Basis of Disease | year = 2009 }}</ref> Treatment should focus on the underlying cause. Symptoms can be treated with bedrest, leg elevation, compressive bandages, wet dressings, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs).<ref name="." /> NSAIDs are usually more effective at the onset of EN versus with chronic disease.

[[Potassium iodide]] can be used for persistent lesions whose cause remains unknown. [[Corticosteroid]]s and [[colchicine]] can be used in severe refractory cases.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mat C, Yurdakul S, Uysal S, Gogus F, Ozyazgan Y, Uysal O, Fresko I, Yazici H | title = A double-blind trial of depot corticosteroids in Behcet's syndrome | journal = Rheumatology (Oxford) | year = 2005 | pmid = 16263779 | doi = 10.1093/rheumatology/kei165 | volume = 45 | pages = 348–52 | issue = 3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Wallace SL | title = Erythema nodosum treatment with colchicine | journal = JAMA | year = 1967 | pages = 1056 | volume = 202 | issue = 11 | pmid = 6072607 | doi = 10.1001/jama.202.11.1056b}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Yurdakul S, Mat C, Tuzun Y, Ozyazgan Y, Hamuryudan V, Uysal O, Senocak M, Yazici H | title = A double-blind trial of colchicine in Behcet's syndrome | journal = Arthritis Rheum | year = 2001 | pages = 2686–92 | volume = 44 | issue = 11 | pmid = 11710724 | doi = 10.1002/1529-0131(200111)44:11<2686::AID-ART448>3.0.CO;2-H}}</ref> [[Thalidomide]] has been used successfully in the treatment of Erythema nodosum leprosum,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Silverman WA |title=The schizophrenic career of a "monster drug" |journal=Pediatrics |volume=110 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=404–6 |year=2002 |month=August |pmid=12165600 |doi=10.1542/peds.110.2.404}}</ref> and it was approved by the U.S. FDA for this use in July 1998.<ref name =Chem>{{cite web|url =http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/83/8325/8325thalidomide.html |title=Thalidomide |accessdate =2006-09-21 |last =Rouhi |first =Maureen |work=Chemical & Engineering News |publisher=[[American Chemical Society]] }}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Erythema nodosum is the most common form of panniculitis (inflammation of the subcutaneous fat). The peak incidence of EN occurs between 18–36 years of age. Women are 3-6 times more affected than men.<ref name="." />
