A '''paradoxical reaction''' or '''paradoxical effect''' is an effect of medical treatment, usually a drug, opposite to the effect which would normally be expected.

An example of a paradoxical reaction is when a [[pain]] relief medication causes an increase in pain.  

For example, there are serious complications occurring in conjunction with the use of [[sedatives]] creating a series of effects in some people, that are the total opposite of those expected. The paradoxical reactions may consist of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], with or without suicidal tendencies, [[phobias]], aggressiveness, [[violence|violent behavior]] and symptoms sometimes misdiagnosed as [[psychosis]].<ref>[http://www.benzo.org.uk/paradox.htm  Benzodiazepines: Paradoxical Reactions & Long-Term Side-Effects]</ref> Some [[sedative]]s prescribed for adults actually cause [[hyperactivity]] in some children.

==Benzodiazepines==
[[Benzodiazepine]]s, a class of psychoactive drugs called the "minor" [[tranquilizer]]s, have varying [[hypnotic]], [[sedative]], [[anxiolytic]], [[anticonvulsant]], and [[muscle relaxant|muscle relaxing]] properties, but they may create the exact opposite effects. Susceptible individuals may respond to benzodiazepine treatment with an increase in [[anxiety]], [[aggressiveness]], [[Anxiety|agitation]], [[confusion]], [[disinhibition]], loss of [[impulse control]], [[talkativeness]], [[violent]] behavior, and even [[convulsions]]. Paradoxical adverse effects may even lead to [[criminal behaviour]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bramness JG, Skurtveit S, Mørland J |title=Flunitrazepam: psychomotor impairment, agitation and paradoxical reactions |journal=Forensic Sci. Int. |volume=159 |issue=2–3 |pages=83–91 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16087304 |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2005.06.009 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0379-0738(05)00392-0}}</ref> Severe behavioral changes resulting from benzodiazepines have been reported including [[mania]], [[schizophrenia]], anger, impulsivity, and [[hypomania]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cole JO |coauthors=Kando JC. |title=Adverse behavioral events reported in patients taking alprazolam and other benzodiazepines |journal=The Journal of clinical psychiatry. |volume=54 |issue=Suppl:49–61 |pages=62–3 |year=1993 |pmid=8262890}}</ref>

Paradoxical rage reactions due to benzodiazepines occur as a result of an altered level of consciousness, which generates [[automatic behaviors]], [[anterograde amnesia]] and uninhibited aggression. These aggressive reactions may be caused by a disinhibiting [[serotonergic]] mechanism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Senninger JL |coauthors=Laxenaire M. |title=[Violent paradoxal reactions secondary to the use of benzodiazepines] | doi = |journal=Annales médico-psychologiques. |volume=153 |issue=4 |pages=278–81 |year=1995 |pmid=7618826}}</ref>

Paradoxical effects of benzodiazepines appear to be dose related, that is, likelier to occur with higher doses.<ref name="pmid15460178">{{cite journal|last1=Mancuso|first1=Carissa E.|last2=Tanzi|first2=Maria G.|last3=Gabay|first3=Michael|title=Paradoxical Reactions to Benzodiazepines: Literature Review and Treatment Options|journal=Pharmacotherapy|volume=24|issue=9|pages=1177–1185|year=2004|month=September|pmid=15460178|doi=10.1592/phco.24.13.1177.38089|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/489358 Paradoxical}}</ref>

In a letter to the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', it was reported that a high proportion of parents referred for actual or threatened [[child abuse]] were taking drugs at the time, often a combination of [[benzodiazepines]] and [[tricyclic antidepressants]]. Many mothers described that instead of feeling less [[anxious]] or depressed, they became more hostile and openly aggressive towards the child as well as to other family members while consuming tranquilizers. The author warned that environmental or social stresses such as difficulty coping with a crying baby combined with the effects of tranquilizers may precipitate a child abuse event.<ref>{{cite journal |author= |coauthors= |title=Letter: Tranquilizers causing aggression |journal=British medical journal. |volume=1 |issue=5952 |pages=266 |date= February 1, 1975 |pmid=234269 |pmc= 1672080}}</ref>

Self aggression has been reported and also demonstrated in laboratory conditions in a clinical study. Diazepam was found to increase people's willingness to harm themselves.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Berman ME, Jones GD, McCloskey MS |title=The effects of diazepam on human self-aggressive behavior |journal=Psychopharmacology (Berl.) |volume=178 |issue=1 |pages=100–6 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15316710 |doi=10.1007/s00213-004-1966-8}}</ref>

Benzodiazepines can sometimes cause a paradoxical worsening of [[EEG]] readings in patients with seizure disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Perlwitz R |coauthors=Grimmberger E, Schmidtsdorf R |year=1980 |month=June |title=[Immediate effect of intravenous clonazepam on the EEG] |journal=Psychiatr Neurol Med Psychol (Leipz) |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=338–44 |pmid=7403357}}</ref>

==Barbiturates==
[[Phenobarbital]] can cause hyperactivity in children.{{Clarify|date=March 2011}} This may follow after a small dose of 20&nbsp;mg, on condition of no phenobarbital administered in previous days.<ref>http://professionals.epilepsy.com/medications/p_phenobarbital_commonside.html</ref> Prerequisity for this reaction is a continued sense of tension. The mechanism of action is not known, but it may be started by the anxiolytic action of the phenobarbital.

==Antipsychotics==
[[Chlorpromazine]], an [[antipsychotic]] and [[antiemetic]] drug, which is classed as a "major" [[tranquilizer]] may cause paradoxical effects such as agitation, excitement, insomnia, bizarre dreams, aggravation of psychotic symptoms and toxic confusional states.<ref>[http://www.rxcarecanada.com/Chlorpromazine.asp?prodid=352 Chlorpromazine - Adverse Effects- Behavioral Reactions]{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref>

==Antidepressants==
Antidepressants can rarely make users obsessively violent or have [[suicidal compulsions]], which is in marked contrast to their intended effect. This can be regarded as a paradoxical reaction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Teicher MH, Glod C, Cole JO |title=Emergence of intense suicidal preoccupation during fluoxetine treatment |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=147 |issue=2 |pages=207–10 |year=1990 |month=February |pmid=2301661 |doi= |url=}}</ref> [[Child]]ren and [[adolescence|adolescents]] are more sensitive to paradoxical reactions of [[self-harm]] and [[suicidal ideation]] while taking [[antidepressants]] but cases are still very rare.<ref>{{cite journal |author=King RA, Riddle MA, Chappell PB, ''et al.'' |title=Emergence of self-destructive phenomena in children and adolescents during fluoxetine treatment |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=179–86 |year=1991 |month=March |pmid=2016219 |doi= 10.1097/00004583-199103000-00003|url=}}</ref>

==Antibiotics==
The paradoxical effect or [[Eagle effect]] (named after H. Eagle who first described it) refers to an observation of an increase in survivors, seen when testing the activity of an [[antimicrobial]] agent.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eagle H, Musselman AD |title=The rate of bactericidal action of penicillin in vitro as a function of its concentration, and its paradoxically reduced activity at high concentrations against certain organisms |journal=J Exp Med |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=99–131 |year=1948 |month=July}}</ref> Initially when an [[antibiotic]] agent is added to a culture media, the number of [[bacteria]] that survive drops, as one would expect. But after increasing the concentration beyond a certain point, the number of bacteria that survive, paradoxically, increases.
