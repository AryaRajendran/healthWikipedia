'''''Gray's Anatomy''''' is an [[English language|English-language]] [[human anatomy]] [[textbook]] originally written by [[Henry Gray]]. Earlier editions were called '''''Anatomy: Descriptive and Surgical''''', but the book's name is commonly shortened to, and later editions are titled, ''Gray's Anatomy''. The book is widely regarded as an extremely influential work on the subject, and has continued to be revised and republished from its initial publication in 1858 to the present day. The 40th (and 150th-year anniversary) edition of the book was published in 2008.<ref name=Moore2008>{{citation |date=30 March 2008 |author=Moore, Wendy |title=Gray's Anatomy celebrates 150th anniversary |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1583282/Grays-Anatomy-celebrates-150th-anniversary.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref>

== Publication history ==
[[Image:Henry Gray bw photo portrait.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry Gray]]]]
=== Origins ===
The [[English people|English]] anatomist [[Henry Gray]] was born in 1827. He studied the development of the [[Endocrine|endocrine glands]] and [[spleen]] and in 1853 was appointed Lecturer on Anatomy at [[St George's Hospital Medical School]] in [[London]]. In 1855, he approached his colleague [[Henry Vandyke Carter]] with his idea to produce an inexpensive and accessible anatomy textbook for medical students. Dissecting unclaimed bodies from workhouse and hospital [[mortuary|mortuaries]] through the [[Anatomy Act]] of 1832, the two worked for 18 months on what would form the basis of the book. Their work was first published in 1858 by [[John William Parker]] in London.<ref name=Gray1858>{{citation |date=1858 |author=Gray, Henry & Carter, Henry Vandyke |title=Anatomy Descriptive and Surgical |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/anatomydescript09graygoog#page/n7/mode/2up |place=London |publisher=John W. Parker and Son |accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref>
It was dedicated by Gray to [[Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 1st Baronet]].
An imprint of this English first edition was published in the United States in 1859, with slight alterations.<ref name=Richardson2005>{{citation |date=2005 |author=Richardson, Ruth |chapter=A Historical Introduction to Gray's Anatomy |chapter-url= http://www.graysanatomyonline.com/content/0443066760/suppfiles/HistoricalIntro.pdf |title=Gray's Anatomy: The Anatomical Basis of Clinical Practice |edition=39th (electronic version) |editor=Susan Standring |page=4 |place=Edinburgh |publisher=Elsevier Churchill Livingston |accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref><ref name=USedition1859>{{citation |date=1859 |author=Gray, Henry & Carter, H.V |url=http://resource.nlm.nih.gov/06220300R |title=Anatomy, descriptive and surgical |place=Philadelphia |publisher=Blanchard and Lea |accessdate=16 October 2011 |postscript=&nbsp;(Per [[United States National Library of Medicine|National Library of Medicine]] holdings). Note: This is not the 'American' edition. American rights had yet to be purchased. It is an American publication of the English edition.}}</ref>
Gray prepared a second, revised edition, which was published in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1860, also by J.W. Parker.<ref name=Moore2008/><ref name=BriefHistoryGrays>{{citation |url= http://www.coursewareobjects.com/marketing/standringtimeline.pdf |title= A brief history of Gray's Anatomy |publisher= [http://www.us.elsevierhealth.com/Veterinary-Medicine/Anatomy/book/9780443066849/Grays-Anatomy/ Elsevier] |accessdate= 16 October 2011}}</ref> However, Gray died the following year, at the age of&nbsp;34, having contracted [[smallpox]]<ref name=Moore2008/> while treating his nephew (who survived). His death had come just three years after the initial publication of his ''Anatomy Descriptive and Surgical''.
Even so, the work on his much-praised book was continued by others.
[[Longman]]'s publication reportedly began in 1863, after their acquisition of the J.W. Parker publishing business.<ref name="LongmanPublication">{{citation|url= http://www-stage.pearsoned.com/about/history.htm#1800  |title= Longman's 1863 publication of ''Gray's Anatomy'' |work=Pearson Education: History |publisher=[[Pearson Education]] |accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref> This coincided with the publication date of the third British edition of ''Gray's Anatomy.''<ref name="GraysAnatomy35thBritish">{{citation| title=Gray's Anatomy | editors=Roger Warwick & Peter L. Williams | edition=35th | publisher= Longman |location=London|year=1973}} p.iv (Previous Editions and Editors - listings)</ref> Successive British editions of ''Gray's Anatomy'' continued to be published under the Longman, and more recently [[Churchill Livingstone]]/[[Elsevier]] imprints, reflecting further changes in ownership of the publishing companies over the years.

=== American editions ===
The full American rights were purchased by Blanchard and Lea, who published the first of twenty-five<ref group=lower-alpha>This count excludes the previously mentioned 1859 US publication of the English first edition.</ref> distinct American editions of ''Gray's Anatomy'' on June 18, 1908. [[Lea & Febiger]] continued publishing the American editions until the company was sold in 1990.<ref>[http://www.tehistory.org/hqda/html/v37/v37n2p063.html#LEA Lea & Febiger] in Tredyffrin East Town Historical Society ''History Quarterly'' Digital Archives, pp. 68-70 (Source: April 1999, Vol. 37, No.2, pp. 63-70)</ref>

The first American publication was edited by Richard James Dunglison, whose father [[Robley Dunglison]] was physician to [[Thomas Jefferson]].<ref>[http://jeffline.jefferson.edu/AISR/Forum/03/09/articles/grays.html "Gray's Anatomy: The Jefferson Years"] in ''Jeffline Forum'', September 2003</ref> Dunglison edited the next four editions. These were: the ''Second American Edition'' (February 1862); the ''New Third American from the Fifth English Edition'' (May 1870); the ''New American from the Eighth English Edition'' (July 1878); and the ''New American from the Tenth English Edition'' (August 1883). [[William Williams Keen|W. W. Keen]] edited the next two editions, namely: the ''New American from the Eleventh English Edition'' (September 1887); and the ''New American from the Thirteenth English Edition'' (September 1893).

In September 1896 reference to the English edition was dropped, and it was published as the ''Fourteenth Edition'', edited by Bern B. Gallaudet, F. J. Brockway, and J. P. McMurrich, who also edited the ''Fifteenth Edition'' (October 1901). The ''Sixteenth Edition'' (October 1905) was edited by J. C. DaCosta, and the ''Seventeenth'' (September 1908) by DaCosta and  [[Edward Anthony Spitzka|E. A. Spitzka]]. Spitzka edited the ''Eighteenth'' (Oct. 1910) and ''Nineteenth'' (July 1913) editions, and in October 1913, R. Howden edited the ''New American from the Eighteenth English Edition''.  The "American" editions then continued with consecutive numbering from the Twentieth onwards, with W. H. Lewis editing the 20th (September. 1918), 21st (August 1924), 22nd (August 1930), 23rd (July 1936), and 24th (May 1942). C. M. Gross edited the 25th (August 1948), 26th (July 1954), 27th (August 1959), 28th (August 1966), and 29th (January 1973). Carmine D. Clemente edited and extensively revised the 30th edition (October 1984).<ref name="GraysAnatomy30thAmerican">{{citation| title=Gray's Anatomy | editor=Carmine D. Clemente | edition=30th | publisher= Lea & Febiger |location=Philadelphia |year=1985|isbn=0-8121-0644-X }} pp. viâ€“ix</ref> With the sale of Lea & Febiger in 1990, the 30th edition was the last American Edition.

=== Discrepancies in numbering of American and British editions ===
Sometimes separate editing efforts with mismatches between British and American edition numbering led to the existence, for many years, of two main "flavors" or "branches" of ''Gray's Anatomy'': the U.S. and the British one. This can easily cause misunderstandings and confusion, especially when quoting from or trying to purchase a certain edition. For example a comparison of publishing histories shows that the American numbering kept roughly apace with the British up until the 16th editions in 1905, with the American editions either acknowledging the English edition, or simply matching the numbering in the 14th, 15th and 16th editions. Then the American numbering crept ahead, with the 17th American edition published in 1908, while the 17th British edition was published in 1909. This increased to a three-year gap for the 18th and 19th editions, leading to the 1913 publication of the ''New American from the Eighteenth English'', which brought the numbering back into line. Both 20th editions were then published in the same year (1918). Thereafter, it was the British numbering that pushed ahead, with the 21st British edition in 1920, and the 21st American edition in 1924. This discrepancy continued to increase, so that the 30th British edition was published in 1949, while the 30th and last American edition was published in 1984.<ref name="GraysAnatomy35thBritish" /><ref name="GraysAnatomy30thAmericanvii">Carmine D.

The newest, 40th edition of ''Gray's Anatomy'' was published on 26&nbsp;September 2008 by [[Elsevier]] under the [[Churchill Livingstone]] imprint in both print and on-line versions. The senior editor of this book and accompanying website is Professor [[Susan Standring]], who is Emeritus Professor of Anatomy at [[King's College London]].
<ref name=Elsevier>{{citation | title = Elsevier: Gray's Anatomy, 40th Edition | url = http://www.us.elsevierhealth.com/product.jsp?isbn=9780443066849}}</ref> The two most recent editions differ from all previous editions in an important respect: They present anatomical structures by their [[regional anatomy]] (i.e. ordered according to what part of the body the structures are located in â€“ e.g. the anatomy of the bones, blood vessels and nerves, etc. of the [[upper extremity]] is described in one place). All previous editions of Gray's Anatomy were organized by [[systemic anatomy]] (i.e. there were separate sections for the body's entire [[skeletal system]], entire [[circulatory system]] and entire [[nervous system]], etc.). The editors of the 39th edition acknowledged the validity of both approaches, but nevertheless switched to regional anatomy by popular demand.<ref name=Grays39eIntroduction>{{citation |date=2004 |title=Gray's Anatomy vol.39e Introduction |url=http://www.graysanatomyonline.com/content/0443066760/suppfiles/HistoricalIntro.pdf |isbn=0-443-06676-0 |accessdate=21 March 2012. |postscript=&nbsp;&nbsp; See page 9, bottom}}</ref>

Older, out-of-copyright editions of the book continue to be reprinted and sold. On the internet in particular, there are numerous offers for older editions. Unfortunately it is not always clear which (British or American) edition these books are republications of. Many seem to be [[reprint]]s of the 1901 (probably U.S.) edition. Also on the internet, there are several sites where various older versions can be read online.<ref>{{cite web|author=Henry Gray |url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL15399118W/Anatomy_descriptive_and_surgical |title=Anatomy, descriptive and surgical |publisher=Open Library |date= |accessdate=2012-09-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/ |title=Gray, Henry. 1918.

Although older editions may serve historic and artistic uses because their companion illustrations and anatomical [[cross section (geometry)|cross sections]] are renowned for their rustic and often haunting presentation, they no longer represent an up-to-date anatomical understanding.<ref group=lower-alpha>Depending on the version at hand, even the suitability of reprints and online versions for artistic purposes may be compromised due to limitations in resolution and reproduction quality.</ref>

Henry Gray wrote the original version of ''Gray's Anatomy'' with an audience of [[medical student]]s and [[physician]]s in mind, especially [[surgery|surgeon]]s. For many decades however, precisely because Gray's textbook became such a classic, successive editors made major efforts to preserve its position as possibly the most authoritative text on the subject in the [[English language]]. Toward this end, a long-term strategy appears to have been to make each edition come close to containing a ''fully comprehensive'' account of the anatomical medical understanding available at the time of publication.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Given the explosion of medical knowledge in the 20th century, it is easily appreciated that this led to a vast expansion of the book, which threatened to collapse under its own weight in a [[metaphor]]ical and physical sense. From the 35th edition onward, increased efforts were made to reverse this trend and keep the book readable by students. Nevertheless, the 38th edition contained 2,092 pages in large format<ref>[http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0443045607 Gray's Anatomy: The Anatomical Basis of Medicine and Surgery (British Edition. 38th Ed) (Hardcover)] Amazon</ref> â€“ the highest page count of any and an increase from the 35th edition, which had 1,471 pages.<ref name=35thEdDescription>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/grays-anatomy/oclc/2973401 Description of 35th Edition (1973) at WorldCat] Retrieved 21 March 2012</ref> The current 40th edition has 1,576 pages.
Newer editions of ''Gray's Anatomy'' â€“and even several recent older onesâ€“ are still considered about the most comprehensive and detailed textbooks on the subject.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-04-10-gray%27s-new-look_x.htm 'Gray's Anatomy' is back after major surgery], By Glenn O'Neal, Posted 4/10/2005, USATODAY.com</ref>
Despite the aforementioned efforts to keep Gray's Anatomy readable by students, when the 39th edition was published, students were identified as a secondary market for the book,<ref>cf. page 11: http://www.graysanatomyonline.com/content/0443066760/suppfiles/HistoricalIntro.pdf</ref> and companion publications such as ''[[Gray's Anatomy for Students]]'',<ref group=lower-alpha>Written by Richard L. Drake, Wayne Vogl and Adam W. M. Mitchell</ref> ''Gray's Atlas of Anatomy'' and ''Gray's Anatomy Review'' have also been published in recent years.<ref>[http://www.us.elsevierhealth.com/dsresults.jsp?lid=1&sid=959&orderby=copyright_desc&searchtype=quicksearch&pageid=55 List of publications, including companion publications to Gray's Anatomy]</ref>
