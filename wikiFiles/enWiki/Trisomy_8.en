'''Trisomy 8''' is a human [[Genetic disorder|chromosomal disorder]] caused by having three copies ([[trisomy]]) of [[chromosome]] [[chromosome 8 (human)|8]]. It can appear with or without [[mosaicism]] it is also called 'Warkany syndrome 2'. 

==Characteristics==
'''Complete trisomy 8''' causes severe effects on the developing fetus and can be a cause of [[miscarriage]].  Complete trisomy 8 is usually an early lethal condition, whereas '''trisomy 8 [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaicism]]''' is less severe and individuals with a low proportion of affected cells may exhibit a comparatively mild range of physical abnormalities and developmental delay.<ref>Jones, K. L.  (2005).  Smith's Recognizable Patterns of Human Malformation.  (6th ed.).  Philadelphia: W. B. Sanders Company.</ref> Individuals with trisomy 8 mosaicism are more likely to survive into childhood and adulthood, and exhibit a characteristic and recognizable pattern of developmental abnormalities. Common findings include retarded psychomotor development, moderate to severe mental retardation, variable growth patterns which can result in either abnormally short or tall stature, an expressionless face, and many musculoskeletal, visceral, and eye abnormalities, as well as other [[Birth defect|anomalies]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Riccardi VM |title=Trisomy 8: an international study of 70 patients |journal=Birth Defects  Orig.

==Synonym==
Trisomy 8 with or without mosaicism is occasionally referred to by the eponym [[Warkany syndrome|Warkany syndrome or Warkany syndrome 2]].

==Other conditions==
Trisomy 8 mosaicism affects wide areas of chromosome 8 containing many genes, and can thus be associated with a range of symptoms. 

* Mosaic trisomy 8 has been reported in rare cases of [[Rothmund-Thomson syndrome]], a genetic disorder associated with the [[DNA helicase]] [[RECQL4]] on chromosome 8q24.3.  The syndrome is "characterized by [[skin atrophy]], [[telangiectasia]], [[hyperpigmentation|hyper-]] and [[hypopigmentation]], [[congenital skeletal abnormalities]], short [[stature]], [[premature aging]], and increased risk of [[malignant disease]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/268400|title=MIM ID #268400 ROTHMUND-THOMSON SYNDROME; RTS|publisher=NCBI/OMIM}}</ref>  

* Some individuals trisomic for chromosome 8 were deficient in production of [[coagulation factor VII]] due to a factor 7 regulation gene (F7R) mapped to 8p23.3-p23.1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/134450|title=MIM ID *134450 FACTOR VII REGULATOR; F7R|publisher=NCBI/OMIM}}</ref>  
* Trisomy and other rearrangements of chromosome 8 have also been found in [[tricho–rhino–phalangeal syndrome]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/190350|title=MIM ID #190350 TRICHORHINOPHALANGEAL SYNDROME, TYPE I; TRPS1|publisher=NCBI/OMIM}}</ref>  

* Small regions of chromosome 8 trisomy and monosomy are also created by [[recombinant chromosome 8 syndrome]] ([[San Luis Valley syndrome]]), causing anomalies associated with [[tetralogy of Fallot]], which results from recombination between a typical chromosome 8 and one carrying a parental paracentric inversion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/179613|title=MIM ID #179613 RECOMBINANT CHROMOSOME 8 SYNDROME|publisher=NCBI/OMIM}}</ref>
  
* Trisomy is also found in some cases of [[chronic myeloid leukaemia]], potentially as a result of karyotypic instability caused by the [[bcr:abl]] [[fusion gene]].
