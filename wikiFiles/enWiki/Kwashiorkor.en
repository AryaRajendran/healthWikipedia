'''Kwashiorkor''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|k|w|ɑː|ʃ|i|ˈ|ɔr|k|ər}}) is an [[acute (medicine)|acute]] form of childhood [[protein-energy malnutrition]] characterized by [[edema]], irritability, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], ulcerating dermatoses, and an enlarged liver with fatty infiltrates. Insufficient [[protein]] consumption, but with sufficient calorie intake, distinguishes it from [[marasmus]]. Kwashiorkor cases occur in areas of famine or poor food supply.<ref>{{cite book|last=Krebs NF, Primak LE, Hambridge KM|title=Normal childhood nutrition & its disorders.

In at-risk populations, kwashiorkor may develop after a mother weans her child from breast milk, replacing it with a diet high in [[carbohydrate]]s, especially [[starch]]es, but deficient in protein.

The defining sign of kwashiorkor in a malnourished child is pedal edema (swelling of the ankles and feet).  Other signs include a distended [[abdomen]], an enlarged liver with fatty infiltrates,  thinning hair, loss of teeth, skin depigmentation and [[dermatitis]].  Children with kwashiorkor often develop irritability and [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]].

Victims of kwashiorkor fail to produce [[antibodies]] following [[vaccination]] against diseases, including [[diphtheria]] and [[typhoid]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=14037411 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14037411 |year=1962 |last1=Pretorius |first1=PJ |last2=De Villiers |first2=LS |title=Antibody response in children with protein malnutrition |volume=10 |pages=379–83 |journal=The American journal of clinical nutrition}}</ref>  Generally, the disease can be treated by adding protein to the diet; however, it can have a long-term impact on a child's physical and mental development, and in severe cases may lead to death.

In dry climates, [[marasmus]] is the more frequent disease associated with malnutrition. Another malnutrition syndrome includes [[cachexia]], although it is often caused by underlying illnesses.  These are important considerations in the treatment of the patients.

Kwashiorkor is a form of malnutrition that is deficient in protein.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)94666-X |title=Kwashiorkor |year=1935 |last1=Williams |first1=Cicely |journal=The Lancet |volume=226 |issue=5855 |pages=1151}}</ref>  The low protein intake leads to some specific signs: edema of the hands and feet, irritability, anorexia, a desquamative rash, hair discoloration, and a large fatty liver. The typical swollen abdomen is due to two causes: ascites because of [[hypoalbuminemia]] (low oncotic pressure), and enlarged fatty liver.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tierney|first=Emily P.|coauthors=Sage, Robert J.; Shwayder, Tor|title=Kwashiorkor from a severe dietary restriction in an 8-month infant in suburban Detroit, Michigan: case report and review of the literature|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|date=1 May 2010|volume=49|issue=5|pages=500–506|doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2010.04253.x}}</ref> 

Ignorance of nutrition can be a cause. Dr. Latham, director of the Program in International Nutrition at [[Cornell University]], along with Keith Rosenberg cited a case where parents who fed their child [[cassava]] failed to recognize malnutrition because of the edema caused by the syndrome and insisted the child was well-nourished despite the lack of dietary protein.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} 

Protein should be supplied only for [[anabolic]] purposes. The [[catabolic]] needs should be satisfied with [[carbohydrate]] and [[fat]]. Protein catabolism involves the [[urea]] cycle, which is located in the liver and can easily overwhelm the capacity of an already damaged organ. The resulting [[liver failure]] can be fatal.  This means in patients suffering from kwashiorkor, protein must be introduced back into the diet gradually.
