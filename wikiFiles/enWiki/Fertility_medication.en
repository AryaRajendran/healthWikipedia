'''Fertility medication''', better known as '''fertility drugs''', are drugs which enhance reproductive [[fertility]]. For women, fertility medication is used to stimulate [[ovarian follicle|follicle]] development of the [[ovary]]. There are currently very few fertility medication options available for men. 

Agents that enhance ovarian activity can be classified as either [[Gonadotropin releasing hormone]], [[Estrogen]] [[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]] or [[Gonadotropins]].

==Female==

===Gonadotropin-releasing hormone===
{{Main|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone}}

Either [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) or any [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist]] (i.e. Lupron) may be used. GnRH releases gonadotropins from the hypothalamus in the body.

===Estrogen antagonists===
Fertility medication inhibiting the effects of [[estrogen]] includes [[Clomiphene]] and [[Aromatase inhibitor]]s.

====Clomiphene====
{{Main|Clomiphene}}
[[Clomiphene]] (trademarked as '''Clomid''') is a [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] (SERM). It is the most widely used fertility drug. It is used as an [[ovarian stimulator]] by inhibiting the negative feedback of estrogen at the hypothalamus.

====Aromatase inhibitors====
{{Main|Aromatase inhibitor}}
Although primarily a breast cancer treatment, [[aromatase inhibitor]]s can also work as fertility medication, probably through a mechanism similar to clomiphene.

===Gonadotropins===
{{Main|Gonadotropin preparations}}
[[Gonadotropins]] are the hormones in the body that normally stimulate the [[gonads]] (testes and ovaries). For medication, they can be extracted from urine or by genetic modification.

For example, the so called [[menotropin]]s consist of [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] and [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]] extracted from human [[urine]] from [[menopausal]] women.<ref>{{MeshName|Menotropins}}</ref> 

There are also recombinant variants which are created by inserting the DNA coding for it into bacteriae. The bacterial DNA is then called [[Recombinant DNA]]. Examples of recombinant FSH are Follistim and Gonal F, while Luveris is a recombinant LH.

===Human chorionic gonadotropin===
{{Main|Human chorionic gonadotropin#Use as medication}}
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is normally produced during pregnancy. However, it can also replace LH as an [[ovulation inducer]].

===Other===
hMG is a medication containing a [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH).

==Male==
There currently are no effective medications to treat [[oligospermia]], so other [[Assisted reproductive technology|assisted reproductive technologies]] are used.

Research in male fertility medication is currently ongoing. A study in Egypt assessed the efficacy of a combination of [[clomiphene]] and [[vitamin E]] in improving [[sperm count]] and [[sperm motility]] in [[male infertility]].<ref>Ghanem H et al. Combination clomiphene and antioxidant therapy for idiopathic male infertility: A randomized controlled trial. Fertil Steril 2009 Mar 5; [e-pub ahead of print]. Published in Journal Watch General Medicine March 31, 2009</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Estrogen antagonists and gonadotropins may stimulate multiple follicles and other ovarian hormones leading to [[multiple birth]] and possible [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]].
