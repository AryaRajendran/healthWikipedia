Frequently touched surfaces have been found to serve as reservoirs for the spread of pathogenic microbes. This is especially true in healthcare facilities, where harmful [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], and [[fungi]] colonize and persist on [[door knobs]], push plates, [[Handrail|railings]], tray tables, [[faucet]] handles, IV poles, [[HVAC]] systems, and other equipment. These microbes can often survive on touch surfaces not made with antimicrobial materials for surprisingly long periods of time (e.g., for more than 30 days on some popular materials).

The surfaces of copper and its alloys, such as [[brass]] and [[bronze]], are [[Antimicrobial properties of copper|antimicrobial]]. They have an inherent ability to kill a wide range of harmful microbes relatively rapidly - often within two hours or less  - and with a high degree of [[efficacy]].<ref>Antimicrobial properties of copper; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_properties_of_copper</ref> These antimicrobial properties has been demonstrated by an extensive body of research. The research also suggests that if touch surfaces are made with [[copper]] alloys, the reduced or totally destroyed [[microbial]] populations on these antimicrobial alloys may ultimately result in reduced incidences of transmission of disease-causing organisms. 

Current knowledge regarding the [[antimicrobial properties of copper]] alloy touch surfaces, results of clinical trials conducted at hospitals around the world, and [[USEPA]]'s registrations of 479 different copper alloys as "antimicrobial materials" with public health benefits are discussed in this article.

==Antimicrobial properties of copper alloy touch surfaces==
''For a detailed discussion, see: [[Antimicrobial properties of copper#Antimicrobial efficacy of copper alloy touch surfaces|Antimicrobial efficacy of copper alloy touch surfaces]].

Copper alloy surfaces have intrinsic properties to destroy a wide range of [[microorganisms]]. In the interest of protecting public health, especially in heathcare environments with their susceptible patient populations, an abundance of peer-reviewed antimicrobial efficacy studies have been and continue to be conducted around the world regarding copper’s efficacy to destroy ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' O157:H7, [[methicillin]]-resistant ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (MRSA), ''[[Staphylococcus]]'', ''[[Clostridium difficile]]'', [[influenza A virus]], [[Adenoviridae|adenovirus]], and [[Fungus|fungi]].<ref>[http://coppertouchsurfaces.org/antimicrobial/bacteria/index.html Copper Touch Surfaces]</ref>

Much of this antimicrobial efficacy work has been or is currently being conducted at the [[University of Southampton]] and [[Northumbria University]] ([[United Kingdom]]), [[University of Stellenbosch]] ([[South Africa]]), [[Panjab University]] ([[India]]), [[University of Chile]] ([[Chile]]), [[Kitasato University]] ([[Japan]]), the Instituto do Mar<ref>http://www.imar.pt</ref> and [[University of Coimbra]] ([[Portugal]]), and the [[University of Nebraska]] and [[Arizona State University]] ([[U.S.A.]])

In the USA, in order to qualify copper and its alloys as registered antimicrobial substances under that nation’s federal pesticide regulations, an extensive additional body of efficacy testing under [[Good Laboratory Practice]] guidelines by an EPA-approved laboratory was required by the [[USEPA]]. After these tests were concluded in 2008, registrations of 282 different copper alloys were granted.

==Clinical trials of antimicrobial copper alloy touch surfaces in healthcare facilities==

[[Microorganisms]] are known to survive on inanimate ‘touch’ surfaces for extended periods of time.<ref>Wilks, S.A., Michels, H., Keevil, C.W., 2005, The Survival of Escherichia Coli O157 on a Range of Metal Surfaces, International Journal of Food Microbiology, Vol. 105, pp. 445–454. and  Michels, H.T. (2006), Anti-Microbial Characteristics of Copper, ASTM Standardization News, October, pp. 28-31</ref> This can be especially troublesome in hospital environments where patients with [[immunodeficiencies]] are at enhanced risk for contracting [[nosocomial infections]] (hospital-borne infections), often with fatal consequences.

Touch surfaces commonly found in hospital rooms, such as bed rails, call buttons, touch plates, chairs, door handles, light switches, grab rails, intravenous poles, dispensers (alcohol gel, paper towel, soap), dressing trolleys, and counter and table tops are known to be contaminated with high levels of potentially dangerous [[bacteria]], including ''[[Staphylococcus]]'', [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]), one of the most virulent strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and [[Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus]] (VRE).<ref>U.S. Department of Defense-funded clinical trials, as presented at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in Washington, D.C., October 28, 2008</ref> Objects in closest proximity to patients have the highest levels of ''staphylococcus'', MRSA, and VRE. This is why touch surfaces in hospital rooms can serve as abundant sources, or reservoirs, for the spread of bacteria from the hands of healthcare workers and visitors to patients. 

Hand and surface [[disinfection]] practices are the first line of defense against infection. However, these have fallen short of expectations as opportunistic organisms put patients and healthcare workers at risk. Since approximately 80% of infectious diseases are known to be transmitted by touch,<ref>TIERNO, P., 2001: The Secret Life of Germs. Atria Books: New York, NY, USA</ref> and pathogens found in healthcare facilities can survive on inanimate surfaces for days and even months,<ref>Kramer, A. et al., 2006, How long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces? A systematic review, ''BMC Infectious Diseases,'' 6:130</ref> the microbial burden of frequently touched surfaces is believed to play a significant role in infection causality.<ref>Boyce, J. M., 2007, Environmental contamination makes an important contribution to hospital infection, ''J Hosp Infect,'' 65 (S2): 50-54</ref><ref>Drees, M. et al, 2008, Prior environmental contamination increases the risk of acquisition of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. ''Clin Infect Disease,'' 46: 678-685</ref><ref>Eckstein, B. C. et al, 2007, Reduction in ''[[Clostridium difficile]]'' and [[Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus]]'' contamination of environmental surfaces after an intervention to improve cleaning methods. ''BMC Infectious Diseases,'' 7:61</ref> Surfaces in hospitals and healthcare facilities are frequently touched and therefore could become reservoirs of infection.<ref>http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/antimicrobial</ref>

To evaluate their effectiveness as secondary infection control measures, these products have been made from copper and its alloys and deployed in hospital geriatric wards, [[intensive care unit]]s, and general medical wards around the world.<ref>Michels, H.T., Estelle, AA, Michel, J.H., Moran, W.R., Clinical Testing of Antimicrobial Copper Alloys, ''Procedings of Cu 2010,'' June 6–10, 2010, Hamburg, Germany; available at: [http://www.cu2010.gdmb.de]</ref>

[[Clinical trial]]s are being conducted on microbial strains unique to individual healthcare facilities around the world to evaluate to what extent copper alloys can reduce the incidence of infection in hospital environments. 

The success of these clinical trials to date, which are summarized here, are prompting hospitals around the world to specify antimicrobial copper touch surfaces as an additional weapon in the fight against infection.<ref>http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/antimicrobial/clinical-trial.shtml</ref>

===Clinical trial in the United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], around 300,000 patients contract [[nosocomial infection]]s each year and at least 5,000 patients die of complications from infections contracted in hospitals.<ref name="CIcoUK">http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/news/press-releases/PR772-first-hospital-specifies-copper.pdf</ref>

For these reasons, a cross-over clinical trial (a test method designed to eliminate variability bias from patients, staff, cleaning efficacy, outbreaks, etc.) evaluating antimicrobial copper alloys was carried out at [[Selly Oak Hospital]] over an 18-month period in 2007-2008 by the [[University Hospital Birmingham]] [[NHS Trust]] and [[Aston University]]. 

Frequently touched surfaces typically manufactured with standard materials (i.e., plastic, chrome, aluminum) were replaced with copper alloys. These included a copper alloy set of sink tap handles (60% Cu, 40% Zn) and a ward entrance door push plate (70% Cu, 30% Zn).

Contamination reductions of 90-100% were observed for ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]], [[Escherichia coli]], [[Klebsiella pneumoniae]], [[Acinetobacter baumanii]], [[Enterococcus spp.]]'', and ''[[Candida albicans]]'' on the copper alloy surfaces versus the non-copper standard surfaces.<ref>http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/antimicrobial/clinical-trial.shtml#sellyoak</ref><ref>Michels, H.T., Estelle, A.A., and Moran, W.R., 2010, ''Procedings of Cu 2010,'' summarized at http://www.cu2010.gdmb.de , June 6–10, Hamburg, Germany</ref> A microorganism reduction of 100% was observed on the hot tap copper alloy handle.<ref>Casey, A.L et. al., 2010, Role of copper in reducing hospital environment contamination, ''J Hosp Infect''., Volume 74, Issue 1, Pages 72-77, available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2009.08.018 and http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/antimicrobial/downloads/uhb-icaac.pdf</ref>

A study completed in April 2011 analyzed the effectiveness of copper-alloy furnishings to lessen the microbial load on various frequently touched surfaces such as door handles, toilet seats, and railings.<ref name='Karpanen'>{{cite journal|last=T. J.|first=Karpanen|coauthors=A. L. Casey, P. A. Lambert, B. D. Cookson, P. Nightingale, L. Miruszenko and T. S. J. Elliott|title=The Antimicrobial Efficacy of Copper Alloy Furnishing in the Clinical Environment: A Crossover Study|journal=[[Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology]]|year=2012|month=January|volume=33|pages=3–9|doi=10.1086/663644|jstor=10.1086/663644|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]}}</ref> Of the 14 surfaces tested 8 had [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] decreases in the number of microbes found on them while the other 6 had a decrease in the number of microbes as well, but not in a statistically significant amount.<ref name='Karpanen'/> Additionally certain microbes in particular were found in far less quantities on the copper-alloy surfaces than on the normal ones, these being [[Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus]], [[Staphylococcus aureus]], and [[Coliform bacteria]].<ref name='Karpanen'/> The study concluded that copper surfaces may be an effective adjunct to safe hygiene practices in a hospital setting.<ref name='Karpanen'/> 

The high degree of clinical performance suggested that copper alloy surfaces may increase the effectiveness of existing infection control practices and may lower the risk of infections acquired in healthcare facilities. 

Based on the results of this and other laboratory and clinical studies, St. Francis Private Hospital, a 140-bed facility located in Mullingar, County Westmeath, [[Ireland]], decided to become the first hospital in the world to fully specify hygienic copper door handles throughout its facility as part of its infection control program.<ref name="CIcoUK"/> A full upgrade of all door furniture (i.e., 250 doorsets, incorporating handles, push plates and privacy locks) to antimicrobial copper in the hospital and nursing home commenced in January 2010.<ref>http://www.saintfrancishospital.ie</ref> 

Healthcare architects in the United Kingdom are now specifying antimicrobial copper. Refurbishment projects specifying copper products are anticipated across [[NHS Trust]] facilities.

===Clinical trial in Chile===
In [[Chile]], 70,000 nosocomial infections are reported each year, most commonly from common hospital-borne pathogens such as ''[[Staphylococcus aureus|S. aureus]],'' ''[[P. aeruginosa]]'' and ''[[A.baumanii]]''. 

In a 30-week clinical trial at the Hospital del Cobre, in [[Calama, Chile|Calama]], extensive microbial analyses were implemented at the facility’s [[intensive care unit]] (ICU).<ref>Prado, V. et. al., 2010, Effectiveness of copper contact surfaces in reducing the microbial burden (MB) in the intensive care unit (ICU) of hospital del Cobre, Calama, Chile, Poster Presentation, 14th International Conference on Infectious Diseases, Miami, USA, 2010</ref> Nine hundred ninety copper surfaces from 90 rooms containing 6 different copper objects were studied against an equivalent number of rooms and surfaces containing non-copper objects. Over-the-bed tables were made from copper alloy C70600. Bedrails were clad with copper alloy C11000 foils. Visitor chairs were fitted with copper alloy C70600 armrests. Copper alloy C71000 intravenous poles were provided. Writing pens used to input data on a touch screen were made from brass (70% Cu, 30% Zn). 

Results of this clinical trial demonstrated an approximately 90% reduction of microorganisms on the copper items compared to the controls after ten weeks.<ref>Michels, H.T., Estelle, A. A., Michel, J.H., and Moran, W.R., 2010, Clinical Testing of Antimicrobial Copper Alloys, ''Proceedings of Cu2010''</ref> A reduction in the total microbial burden was seen for each class of microbe evaluated. Furthermore, continuous antimicrobial activity of copper persisted throughout the study. 

Copper was effective in reducing microbial loads on all 6 surfaces tested (i.e., bed rails by 91%, bed levers by 82%, tray tables by 83%, chair arms by 92%, monitor pen by 49%, and IV poles by 88%). 

Average microbial burden counts in rooms with copper touch surfaces were significantly lower than in rooms without copper surfaces. ''[[Staphylococci]]'' were the most predominant microorganism isolated and copper was effective in reducing the ''[[Staphylococci]]'' microbial burden. Further studies regarding the clinical implications of copper’s intrinsic ability to reduce microbial burdens in hospitals are being planned.

===Clinical trials in Japan===
Researchers from the [[Kitasato University]] School of Medicine conducted antimicrobial studies of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus|S. aureus]]'', ''[[E. coli]]'', and ''[[P. aeruginosa]]'' on various [[Japan]]ese copper alloy coins and on copper alloy plates. The microbes were strains from hospital environments. Copper and its [[nickel-silver]], [[cupronickel]], and [[brass]] alloys were found to kill the bacteria within a short time. In another experiment, bacterial colonies were investigated on ball point pens made with and without copper alloys. Total bacterial colonies on the copper pens were much lower than on the non-copper pens: 2.1 [[Colony-forming unit|CFU]] versus 47.8 CFU. ''[[Staphyloccocus]]'' counts on copper ball point pens were also much lower: 0.7 CFUs versus 20.8 CFUs on non-copper pens.<ref>Sasahara, T. Niiyama, M., and Ueno, Miho, 2007, Use of copper and its alloys to reduce bacterial contamination in hospitals, Journal of Japan Research Institute for Advanced Copper-Base Materials and Technologies. Vol. 46, pp. 12-16</ref>  

Due to the success of these results, a 2-year clinical trial was conducted to monitor contamination levels of [[nosocomial]] bacteria in the [[dermatology]] ward and [[neonatal]] [[intensive care unit]] (NICU) at [[Kitasato University]] Hospital. The antimicrobial efficacy of copper on floors, sinks, push plates, showerheads and doorknobs was evaluated by comparing bacterial loads on these surfaces and on their non-copper counterparts. 

The number of viable ''[[Staphylococcus]] spp''. organisms on surfaces containing copper and its alloy were reduced by half to one-thirtieth of that on control surfaces, depending upon surface humidity and the frequency of contact. Similar definitive findings were also obtained for ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.<ref>Sasahara, T., Niiyama, M., and Ueno, M., 2007, Use of copper and its alloys to reduce bacterial contamination in hospitals, Journal of Japan Research Institute for Advanced Copper-Base Materials and Technologies, Vol. 46, pp. 12-16.</ref><ref>Sasahara, T., Kikuno, R., Fujiki, K., Takayama, Y., Sunagawa, K., and Inoue, M., 2008, ''The Journal of the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases'', 82, p. 407</ref><ref>Niiyama, N., Sasahara, T., Mase, H., 2009, Clinical Trial of the Antimicrobial Effects of Copper and its Alloy in the Hospital Ward, Journal of Japan Research Institute for Advanced Copper-Base Materials and Technologies, Vol. 48, No. 1, pp. 0. 1.</ref>

Various metals were evaluated for their antimicrobial efficacies, including [[copper]] alloys, [[zinc]], [[nickel]], [[tin]], [[silver]], and [[gold]].<ref>Sasahara, T. and Niiyama, N. 2008, Bactericidal activity and sensitization capacity of copper and its alloy, ''Journal of the JRICu'', Vol. 47, No. 1</ref> Antimicrobial efficacies generally followed [[Lewis acidity]] values of the various metals. Silver, a prohibitively expensive [[precious metal]], had the highest bactericidal activity; copper came in second.  The study also found that [[contact dermatitis]] [[allergies]] rarely occur if copper is used as a hygienic touch material.<ref>Sasahara, T., Niiyama, N., Abe, M., Fujiki, K., Takayama, Y., Ozawa, T., Kikuno, R., and Saito, H., 2008, Environmental Infection, 23, p. 224.</ref> 

The bactericidal activity of copper was also tested against two strains of [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus|S. aureus]]'' ''in vitro'' to determine whether copper alloys are effective in preventing the spread of contamination on the touch surface products used in the hospital ward.<ref>Niiyama, N., Amoh, Y., Abe, M., Saito, H., Sasahara, T., and Katsuoka, K., 2009, The Use of Metallic Copper for Prevention of Spreading Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' Contamination in Hospitals, ''Jpn J Dermatol'', 119 (5), 899 - 906</ref> [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and ''S. aureus'' counts fell below detection limits within 180 minutes. The results indicated that copper has a strong bactericidal effect against ''S. aureus'', including [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]. 

When a copper plate was situated on a [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]-infected floor in the dermatology ward  around a bed of a MRSA-infected patient, the bacterial count of ''S. aureus'', including [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and the other ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' on the floor covered with a copper plate was significantly less than on a floor unprotected by copper alloys. These results suggested that the copper plate helped to prevent the spread of [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] contamination in the hospital.

===Clinical Trial in South Africa===
Multidrug-resistant and extremely drug resistant ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' (MTB) is responsible for the spread of [[tuberculosis]] in [[South Africa]]n hospitals. Test strains of ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' meticillin-resistant ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (MRSA), and MTB were isolated from South African patients at a hospital’s intensive care unit in order to establish the minimum ''[[in-vitro]]'' copper concentrations to produce [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] against these microbes and [[yeast]].<ref>Mehtar, S., Wiid, I., and Todorov, S.D., 2007, The antimicrobial activity of copper and copper alloys against nosocomial pathogens and Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from healthcare facilities in the Western Cape: an in-vitro study, ''Journal of Hospital Infection'', 1-7</ref> ''[[Acinetobacter baumannii]]'' was isolated from a patient in a burn unit and two clinical strains of MTB were collected and tested.<ref>Fau´ndez, G., Troncoso, M., Navarrete,. P., Figueroa, G., 2004, Antimicrobial activity of copper surfaces against suspensions of Salmonella enterica and Campylobacter jejuni, ''BMC Microbiol'', 4:19</ref><ref>Singh, J.A., Upshur, R., Padayatchi, N., 2006, XDR-TB in South Africa: no time for denial or complacency. PLoS Med, 4:1</ref>

Copper and its alloys demonstrated antimicrobial activities against multiple-antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria and ''[[Candida albicans|C. albicans]]'' isolated from the hospital, whereas [[stainless steel]] and [[PVC]] did not. Copper and its alloys showed a marked inhibitory effect (88-98%) on MTB despite the strain’s drug resistance. The researchers concluded that the minimum concentration of copper to be an effective antimicrobial agent is >55% for yeasts and bacteria. Higher concentrations of copper were found to be necessary to inhibit MTB.

===Clinical trials in the USA===
In the [[USA]], a high degree of statistical significance is needed to provide a convincing argument to U.S. federal government healthcare authorities, such as the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), regarding the effectiveness of copper alloys in reducing microbial loads and cross infection in healthcare environments.  For this reason, clinical trials at three major US hospitals are currently examining environmental bacterial loads, infection rates, and impacts on cross-contamination in intensive care unit (ICU) rooms retrofitted with copper touch surfaces versus rooms without copper surfaces. 

The trials are funded by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DOD) under the [[Telemedicine_and_Advanced_Technology_Research_Center_(United_States_Army)|Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC)]], a subordinate element of the [[United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command]] (USAMRMC). DOD has extraordinary interests in the potential for antimicrobial copper surfaces to reduce hospital-acquired infections because it wants to prevent hospital-acquired infections among thousands of its enlisted armed forces servicemen and servicewomen who have been injured in recent conflicts. TATRC, which funds a Military Infectious Disease Program<ref>Internal Medicine World Report, 2007</ref> has been granted funds by the [[United States Congress]] to evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of copper, brass and bronze alloys. The studies are coordinated through the Advanced Technology Institute in Charleston, South Carolina.

The clinical studies involve intensive care units (ICUs) at [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] in New York City, one of the world’s most prestigious cancer facilities, the [[Medical University of South Carolina]], and the [[Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]]. 

An evaluation of the microbial burden of various objects in the ICU rooms has been documented and is available.<ref>http://coppertouchsurfaces.org/technical/Copper%20MB%20Poster3.pdf</ref>

Early results disclosed in 2011 indicate that the coppered rooms demonstrated a 97% reduction in surface [[pathogens]] versus the non-coppered rooms. This reduction is the same level achieved by “terminal” cleaning regimens conducted after patients vacate their rooms. Furthermore, of critical importance to health care professionals, the preliminary results indicated that patients in the coppered ICU rooms had a 40.4% lower risk of contracting a [[hospital acquired infection]] versus patients in non-coppered ICU rooms.<ref>http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1753-6561-5-s6-o53.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.coppertouchsurfaces.org/press/releases/20110701.html</ref><ref>World Health Organization’s 1st International Conference on Prevention and Infection Control (ICPIC) in Geneva, Switzerland on July 1st, 2011</ref> The U.S. Department of Defense investigation contract, which is ongoing, will also evaluate the effectiveness of copper alloy touch surfaces to prevent the transfer of [[microbe]]s to patients and the transfer of microbes from patients to touch surfaces, as well as the potential efficacy of copper-alloy based components to improve [[indoor air quality]].

The latest results from the studies at the three institutions will be developed into a manuscript for publication.

In a separate initiative not funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, clinical trials at an infectious disease outpatient ward consisting of patients with [[HIV]] and other [[infectious disease]]s are being conducted at [[North Shore University Hospital]] in [[Manhasset]], [[New York]].  An alloy of 90% Cu 10% Ni significantly lowered the microbial burden, primarily ''[[Staphylococci]]'', on arm surfaces of [[phlebotomist|phlebotomy]] chairs versus wooden arm surfaces. The median reduction for total bacteria on the copper alloy chairs arms was 90%. Use of the chair with copper arm tops resulted in a 17-fold lower risk of exposure to environmental microbes than when patients used the standard chair. The majority of the samples from the chairs with copper components were below the 500 CFU/ cm2 level believed to represent a risk to hospital patients.<ref>Dancer, S. J., 2004, How do we assess hospital cleaning? A proposal for microbiological standards for surface hygiene in hospitals,  ''J Hosp Infect'',  56:10-15</ref><ref>Malik, R. E., Cooper, R. A., and Griffith, C. J., 2003, Use of audit tools to evaluate the efficacy of cleaning systems in hospitals, ''Am J Infect Control'', 31:181-187</ref>
 
The microbiocidal properties of the copper chair arms were able to confer an ‘antimicrobial halo’ within the general vicinity of the arm top. The microbial burden associated with the wooden side arms of the copper covered chair arms was 70%, lower than those on the control chair. This halo effect may help to help reduce the transfer of pathogenc bacteria.<ref>Hirsch, B.E., et al., 2010, Copper Surfaces Reduce the Microbial Burden in an Out-Patient Infectious Disease Practice, Poster presentation, 50th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents in Chemotherapy, Boston, in September</ref>

Similarly, patients and healthcare workers who used chairs with copper trays were subjected to a 15-fold lower risk than the patients using chairs with composite trays.  The microbial burden on copper trays was reduced by 88% compared to the composite plastic surface.<ref>http://coppertouchsurfaces.org/technical/related-trials.html</ref><ref><http://coppertouchsurfaces.org/technical/documents/2010Hirsch-et-al.pdf</ref>

==USEPA registrations of antimicrobial copper alloy touch surfaces==

On February 29, 2008, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) approved the registrations of five different groups of [[copper]] alloys as “[[antimicrobial]] materials” with public health benefits.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/copper-alloy-products.htm EPA registers copper-containing alloy products], May 2008</ref> The EPA registrations now cover 479 different compositions of copper alloys within six groups ''(an up-to-date list of all approved alloys is available).''<ref>Antimicrobial Copper: Complete listing of EPA registered Antimicrobial Copper Alloys; http://www.antimicrobialcopper.com/us/news-center/news/epa-registers-124-additional-antimicrobial-copper-alloys.aspx</ref> All of the alloys have minimum nominal copper concentrations of 60%. The results of the EPA-supervised antimicrobial studies demonstrating copper's strong antimicrobial efficacies across a wide range of alloys have been published.<ref>EPA registers copper-containing alloy products; May 2008; http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/copper-alloy-products.htm</ref><ref>Collery, Ph., Maymard, I., Theophanides, T., Khassanova, L., and Collery, T., Editors, Metal Ions in Biology and Medicine: Vol. 10., John Libbey Eurotext, Paris © 2008, Antimicrobial regulatory efficacy testing of solid copper alloy surfaces in the USA, by Michels, Harold T. and Anderson, Douglas G. (2008), pp. 185-190.</ref>

These copper alloys are the only solid surface materials to be granted “antimicrobial public health claims” status by EPA. Before these registrations were granted, only antimicrobial gases, liquids, sprays, and concentrated powders, including sterilizers, disinfectants and antiseptics, were registered to make antimicrobial public health claims.

===Microbes tested and killed in EPA laboratory tests===
The [[bacteria]] destroyed by copper alloys in the EPA-supervised antimicrobial efficacy tests include: 
*''[[Escherichia coli]]'' O157:H7, a foodborne pathogen associated with large-scale food recalls.
*[[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]), one of the most virulent strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and a common culprit of hospital- and community-acquired infections.
*''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', the most common of all bacterial ''staphylococcus'' (i.e., Staph) infections that cause life-threatening disease, including pneumonia and meningitis.
*''[[Enterobacter aerogenes]]'', a pathogenic bacterium commonly found in hospitals that causes opportunistic skin infections and impacts other body tissues.
*''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', a bacterium in immunocompromised individuals that infects the pulmonary and urinary tracts, blood and skin.
*[[Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus]] (VRE), a pathogenic bacterium that is the second leading cause of hospital-acquired infections.

===EPA test protocols for copper alloy surfaces===

The registrations are based on studies supervised by EPA which found that copper alloys kill more than 99.9% of disease-causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly (i.e., the metals are free of dirt or grime that may impede the bacteria’s contact with the copper surface).

To attain the EPA registrations, the copper alloy groups had to demonstrate strong antimicrobial efficacies according to all of the following rigorous tests:
*''Efficacy as a [[sanitizer]]'': This test protocol measures surviving bacteria on alloy surfaces after two hours.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/antimicrobials/pdf_files/test_method_copper_alloy_surfaces.pdf Test Method for Efficacy of Copper Alloy Surfaces as a Sanitizer], EPA</ref>
*''Residual self-sanitizing activity'': This test protocol measures surviving bacteria on alloy surfaces before and after six wet and dry wear cycles over 24 hours in a standard wear apparatus.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/antimicrobials/pdf_files/test_meth_residual_surfaces.pdf Test Method for Residual Self-Sanitizing Activity of Copper Alloy Surfaces], EPA</ref>

===Claims granted by EPA in antimicrobial copper alloy registrations===
The following claims are now legally permitted when marketing EPA-registered antimicrobial copper alloys in the USA: 
{{Quotation|Laboratory testing has shown that when cleaned regularly:
*Antimicrobial Copper Alloys continuously reduce bacterial contamination, achieving 99.9% reduction within two hours of exposure.
*Antimicrobial Copper Alloy surfaces kill greater than 99.9% of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria within two hours of exposure.
*Antimicrobial Copper Alloy surfaces deliver continuous and ongoing antibacterial action, remaining effective in killing greater than 99% of bacteria within two hours.
*Antimicrobial Copper Alloys surfaces kill greater than 99.9% of bacteria within two hours, and continue to kill 99% of bacteria even after repeated contamination.
*Antimicrobial Copper Alloys surfaces help inhibit the buildup and growth of bacteria within two hours of exposure between routine cleaning and sanitizing steps.
*Testing demonstrates effective antibacterial activity against ''Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes,'' Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (MRSA), ''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7, and ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''}}

The registrations state that “antimicrobial copper alloys may be used in hospitals, other healthcare facilities, and various public, commercial and residential buildings.”

===Public health claims granted by EPA in antimicrobial copper alloy registrations===
The EPA copper alloy registrations were granted “with public health claims,” meaning that they permit manufacturers of copper-based products sold in the U.S. to claim on their labels the ability of copper, brass, and bronze to kill harmful, potentially deadly bacteria.

===Product stewardship requirements of EPA===

As a condition of registration established by EPA, the Copper Development Association (CDA) in the USA is responsible for the [[product stewardship]] of antimicrobial copper alloy products. CDA must ensure that manufacturers promote these products in an appropriate manner. Manufacturers must only promote the proper use and care of these products and must specifically emphasize that the use of these products is a supplement and not a substitute to routine hygienic practices. 

EPA mandated that all advertising and marketing materials for antimicrobial copper products contain the following statement: 

{{quotation|The use of a Copper Alloy surface is a supplement to and not a substitute for standard infection control practices; users must continue to follow all current infection control practices, including those practices related to cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces.  The Copper Alloy surface material has been shown to reduce microbial contamination, but it does not necessarily prevent cross-contamination.}}  

Antimicrobial copper alloys are intended to provide supplemental antimicrobial action in between routine cleaning of environmental or touch surfaces in healthcare settings, as well as in public buildings and the home. Users must also understand that in order for antimicrobial copper alloys to remain effective, they cannot be coated in any way.

CDA is currently implementing an outreach program through written communications, a product stewardship website,<ref>http://www.antimicrobialcopper.com</ref> and through a Working Group which meets periodically to expand educational efforts. 

More than 100 different potential product applications were cited in the registrations for their potential public health benefits.
