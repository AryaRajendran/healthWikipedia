A '''zygote''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ζυγωτός ''zygōtos'' "joined" or "yoked", from ζυγοῦν ''zygoun'' "to join" or "to yoke"),<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.myetymology.com/english/zygote.html |title=English etymology of zygote |work=myetymology.com}}</ref> is the initial [[cell (biology)|cell]] formed when two [[gamete]] cells are joined by means of [[sexual reproduction]]. In multicellular organisms, it is the earliest developmental stage of the [[embryo]]. In single-celled organisms, the zygote divides to produce offspring, usually through [[meiosis]]. Meiosis is the formation of gametes. [[Mitosis]] is the process of cell division.

A zygote is always synthesized from the union of two gametes, and constitutes the first stage in a unique organism's [[developmental biology|development]]. Zygotes are usually produced by a [[fertilization]] event between two [[ploidy|haploid]] cells—an [[ovum]] ([[female]] gamete) and a [[sperm]] cell ([[male]] gamete)—which combine to form the single [[ploidy|diploid]] cell. Such zygotes contain [[DNA]] derived from both parents, and this provides all the genetic information necessary to form a new individual.

==Plants==
In [[embryophyte|land plants]], the zygote is formed within a chamber called the [[archegonium]].  In seedless plants, the archegonium is usually flask-shaped, with a long hollow neck through which the sperm cell enters.  As the zygote divides and grows, it does so inside the archegonium.
zygote is formed due to fusion of sperm and ovum in oviduct.zygote is morula [[a mass of cells]] , then it undergo mitosis and cell divides and form blastocyst. zygote undergo divisions for four days and on fifth day it forms a blastocyst.

==Animals==
In animal development, the term ''zygote'' is also used more loosely to refer to the group of cells formed by the first few cell divisions, although this is properly referred to as a [[morula]].<ref>Neas, John F. [http://cwx.prenhall.com/bookbind/pubbooks/martini10/chapter28/custom3/deluxe-content.html "Human Development"]. ''Embryology Atlas''</ref>	

In [[mammalian reproduction]], after fertilization has taken place the zygote travels down the [[fallopian tube]], while [[cell division|dividing to form more cells]]<ref>O’Reilly, Deirdre. "[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002398.htm Fetal development]". ''[[MedlinePlus|MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia]]'' (2007-10-19). Retrieved 2009-02-15.</ref> without the zygote actually increasing in size. This cell division is [[mitosis|mitotic]], and is known as ''[[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]]''.<ref>Klossner, N. Jayne and Hatfield, Nancy. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=rAOTF7g6tbgC&pg=PA107&dq=zygote+cleavage+blastocyst&as_brr=3&ei=mJaYSbj2CZjEM-Hc9KQJ Introductory Maternity & Pediatric Nursing,]'' p. 107 ([[Lippincott Williams & Wilkins]], 2006).</ref> All mammals go through the zygote stage of life. Mammalian zygotes eventually develop into a [[blastocyst]], after which they are more generally termed an embryo, and then a [[fetus]].

A human zygote exists as a single cell before undergoing cleavage, forming [[blastomere| blastomeres]]<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/69084/blastomere Blastomere  Encyclopædia Britannica]. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 06 Feb. 2012.</ref>, and becomes a [[blastocyst]] on the fifth day.<ref>Blackburn, Susan. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=2y6zOSQcn14C&pg=PA77&dq=zygote&num=100&as_brr=3&ei=lwCTSf_4EoTOlQT4zdClAg#PPA80,M1 Maternal, Fetal, & Neonatal Physiology,]'' p. 80 (Elsevier Health Sciences 2007).</ref>

==In other species==
A '''biparental zygote''' is a [[Chlamydomonas]] (a kind of [[algae]]) zygote that contains [[chloroplast]] DNA ([[cpDNA]]) from both parents.
