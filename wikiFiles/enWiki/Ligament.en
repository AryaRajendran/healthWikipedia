In [[anatomy]], a '''ligament''' is the fibrous [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] that connects [[bone]]s to other bones and is also known as ''articular ligament'', ''articular larua'',<ref>{{DorlandsDict|five/000059130|ligament}}</ref> ''fibrous ligament'', or ''true ligament''.

'''Ligament''' can also refer to:
* ''Peritoneal ligament'': a fold of [[peritoneum]] or other membranes.
* ''Fetal remnant ligament'': the remnants of a tubular structure from the [[fetus|fetal]] period of life.
* ''Periodontal ligament'': a group of fibers that attach the [[cementum]] of [[tooth|teeth]] to the surrounding [[alveolar process|alveolar bone]].

The study of ligaments is known as [[wikt:desmology|desmology]] (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|δεσμός}}, ''desmos'', "bond"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'').

Ligaments are similar to [[tendon]]s and [[fasciae]] as they are all made of collagen except that ligaments join one bone to another bone, tendons join muscle to bone and fasciae connect muscles to other muscles.

==Articular ligaments ==
"Ligament" most commonly refers to a band of tough, fibrous [[dense regular connective tissue]] bundles, comprising attenuated [[collagenous]] [[animal fiber|fibers]]; with said bundles protected by [[dense irregular connective tissue]] sheaths.  Ligaments connect bones to other bones to form a [[joint]]. They do not connect [[muscle]]s to bones; that is the job of [[tendon]]s. Some ligaments limit the mobility of articulations, or prevent certain movements altogether.

Capsular ligaments are part of the articular capsule that surrounds [[synovial joint]]s.  They act as mechanical reinforcements.  Extra-capsular ligaments join  together in harmony with the other ligaments and provide joint stability.  Intra-capsular ligaments, which are much less common,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} also provide stability but permit a far larger range of motion.  [[Cruciate ligament]]s occur in pairs of three.

Ligaments are [[viscoelastic]]. They gradually shrink when under tension, and return to their original shape when the tension is removed. However, they cannot retain their original shape when compassed past a certain point or for a prolonged period of time. This is one reason why [[dislocation (medicine)|dislocated]] joints must be set as quickly as possible: if the ligaments lengthen too much, then the joint will be weakened, becoming prone to future dislocations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  Athletes, gymnasts, dancers, and martial artists perform stretching exercises to lengthen their ligaments, making their joints more supple.

The term "double-jointed" refers to people with more-elastic ligaments, allowing their joints to stretch and contort further. The medical term for describing such double-jointed persons is [[hyperlaxity]].

The consequence of a broken ligament can be instability of the joint. Not all broken ligaments need surgery, but, if surgery is needed to stabilise the joint, the broken ligament can be repaired. [[Granulation tissue|Scar tissue]] may prevent this. If it is not possible to fix the broken ligament, other procedures such as the [[Brunelli procedure]] can correct the instability. Instability of a joint can over time lead to wear of the cartilage and eventually to [[osteoarthritis]].

==Peritoneal ligaments==
Certain folds of [[peritoneum]] are referred to as ''ligaments''.  Examples include:
* The [[hepatoduodenal ligament]], that surrounds the [[hepatic portal vein]] and other vessels as they travel from the [[duodenum]] to the [[liver]].
* The [[broad ligament of the uterus]], also a fold of peritoneum.

==Fetal remnant ligaments==
Certain tubular structures from the fetal period are referred to as ''ligaments'' after they close up and turn into cord-like structures:{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

 |-
 | intra-hepatic portion of the fetal left umbilical vein (the [[ductus venosus]]) || [[ligamentum venosum]]
 |-
 | [[distal]] portions of the fetal left and right [[umbilical arteries]] || [[medial umbilical ligaments]]
