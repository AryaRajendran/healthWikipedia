'''Hariot Georgina Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava''' [[Royal Order of Victoria and Albert|VA]] [[Order of the Crown of India|CI]] [[Order of the British Empire|DBE]] (5 February 1843 – 25 October 1936) was a [[Peerage|British peeress]], known for her success in the role of "diplomatic wife", and for leading an initiative to improve medical care for women in [[British India]].

==Biography==
Born Hariot Georgina Rowan-Hamilton, she was the eldest of the seven children of [[Archibald Rowan-Hamilton]] of [[Killyleagh Castle]]. On 23 October 1862 she married her distant cousin, the [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|5th Baron Dufferin and Claneboye]] and they later had three daughters and six sons.

Her husband was created Earl of Dufferin in 1871 and she and their children travelled with him to [[Canada]] a year later, upon his appointment as [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]]. Lady Dufferin was one of the most popular of governor-general's wives, and was starting to build up her reputation as "the most effective diplomatic wife of her generation". ([[ODNB]]) She was sad to leave when the earl's term ended in 1878.

Next he was ambassador to [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] from 1879–81, and to the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1881–84, where she received the Grand Crescent of the Turkish [[Order of the Chefakat]] in 1883, followed by the Persian [[Order of the Sun (Persia)|Order of the Sun]] in 1887. In both [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Constantinople]], as at all their embassies, the couple were known for their hospitality.

Lady Dufferin then went with her husband to [[India]] in 1884 when he was appointed as the country's [[Viceroy of India|viceroy]], and set up the ''National Association for supplying Female Medical Aid to the Women of India'' (known as the [[Countess of Dufferin Fund]]) a year later. This association recruited and trained women doctors, midwives and nurses to improve the situation for Indian women in illness and in child-bearing. As well as the numerous 'Lady Dufferin' hospitals and clinics which were established, some of which still exist under that name, there are medical colleges and midwifery schools named after her. This involved her in a great deal of fund-raising and is sometimes referred to as her [[zenana]] work; it was celebrated by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in his ''Song of the Women''. She received the Crown of India in 1884 and the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert in 1889.

When the earl's term in India ended in 1888, they travelled back to their home at [[Clandeboye Estate|Clandeboye]] in [[Ireland]] and her husband was elevated in the peerage as the Marquess of Dufferin and Ava that same year. He continued his ambassadorial career in [[Europe]] and the marchioness accompanied him to [[Italy]] and [[France]]. She published her memoirs, based on the letters she had written to her mother: ''Our Viceregal Life in India'' (1889) and ''My Canadian Journal'' (1891). They retired to Clandeboye in 1896.

After her husband died in 1902, she spent much of her time in a relatively modest house in [[Chelsea, London]], economising when possible to help her sons. She wrote ''My Russian and Turkish Journals'' (1916) and was made a [[Order of the British Empire|DBE]] in 1917. None of her sons outlived her, though two daughters did. Two sons died in infancy, two in war, and her youngest, [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 3rd Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Frederick]], was killed in an accident in 1930. She died in London in 1936 and was buried at Clandeboye.
