UMHS includes the U-M Medical School, with its Faculty Group Practice and many research laboratories; the U-M Hospitals and Health Centers, which includes University Hospital, [[C.S. Mott Children's Hospital]], Von Voigtlander Women's Hospital, 120 outpatient clinics and approximately 40 health centers; the clinical programs of the U-M School of Nursing; and the activities of the Michigan Health Corporation, through which UMHS partners with other medical centers and hospitals to provide specialized care throughout [[Michigan]]. 

In July 2011, the University of Michigan Hospitals & Health Centers finished its 15th straight fiscal year in the black, with an operating margin of 2.1 percent ($44.1 million) on revenues of $2.1 billion. In 2010, the Hospitals and Health Centers attained an operating margin of 3.21 percent ($63.2 million) on revenues of about $1.97 billion. As a not-for-profit entity, UMHS uses positive operating margins to fund continued advances in patient care, education, research, and the facilities needed to support these functions.<ref name="fy2011">{{cite press release| url=http://www.uofmhealth.org/news/budget+2012+0616| title=Financially strong and growing for the future| publisher=U-M Health System| date=16 June 2011}}</ref>

==Overview==
[[Image:University of Michigan Health System East Campus.JPG|thumb|250px|UMHS East Campus]]

===Hospital and outpatient care===
UMHS is known for providing a broad range of high-quality care, with specialized centers for Alzheimer's disease, cancer, cardiovascular care, depression, diabetes, epilepsy, geriatrics, organ transplant, pediatrics, trauma/burn, vision, and women’s health research and care. Its hospitals have 925 licensed beds. As a tertiary care center, UMHS has 179 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, giving it one of the highest number of ICU beds in the country. 

UMHS is also a high-volume surgical center with a total of 66 operating rooms. The construction of the $523 million Children and Women's Hospital and the $132 million Eye Center expansion will add 18 operating rooms to the Health System for a total of 82 operating rooms. Outpatient care is provided at the main medical campus in Ann Arbor and at numerous satellite locations.<ref name="facts">{{cite web| url=http://www.med.umich.edu/1busi/facts.htm| title=U-M Health System Facts & Figures| publisher=University of Michigan Health System| accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref>

More than 1.8 million outpatient and emergency visits, 44,000 hospital stays, 46,000 surgeries and 4,000 births take place each year at facilities operated by the Hospitals and Health Centers unit of UMHS, including the University Hospital, C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital, Women’s Hospital and the A. Alfred Taubman Health Care Center.<ref name="care">{{cite web| title=Patient Care at University of Michigan Health System| url=http://www.uofmhealth.org/about+umhs/about-clinical-care| publisher=University of Michigan Health System| accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref>

The University of Michigan Hospitals & Health Centers unit has nearly 26,000 employees, including 3,500 nurses.<ref name="facts"/>  The Michigan Visiting Nurses, a wholly owned part of the Michigan Health Corporation, provides a broad range of high-quality home care services in a 13-county area of southeastern Michigan. These include home nursing, specialty treatments, therapy and palliative care. It also provides public and employer-based immunization services.
The University of Michigan Health System owns and operates three helicopters and a Cessna jet in a medical evacuation program called '''Survival Flight''' that brings critically ill patients from throughout Michigan and the nation to Ann Arbor for care. The 3 helicopters make 1400 trips annually to transport ill patients from Michigan, Ohio, and Ontario to UMHS. The Cessna twin engine jet makes 150 trips annually to locations across the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

From 1986 to 2006, the Health System included M-CARE, a managed care organization that provided health plans to University faculty, staff, retirees and dependents, and to employees of companies throughout Michigan. In late 2006, due to rapidly changing conditions in the health plan climate and the need for the Health System to focus on its core missions of patient care, research and education, it sold M-CARE to [[Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan]] and its Blue Care Network subsidiary.

===Medical school===
[[Image:University of Michigan Medical Center.JPG|thumb|350px|University of Michigan Medical Center]]
All 1,650 physicians who are part of the U-M Medical School Faculty Group Practice hold faculty positions. Patients at many hospitals and clinics in southeastern Michigan also receive U-M physicians' care through affiliations with other health institutions, including the [[Veterans Health Administration|VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System]].

A total of 683 medical students, 1,010 interns and residents, 503 graduate students and 482 postdoctoral research fellows are currently in training at the Medical School, and more than 15,000 practicing physicians and health professionals receive continuing medical education through U-M courses each year. In addition to the M.D. program and post-M.D. residency and fellowship Graduate Medical Education programs, the U-M Medical School offers master's degree, Ph.D. and post-Ph.D. training in the basic sciences through the [http://www.med.umich.edu/pibs/ Program in Biomedical Sciences (PIBS)] and the [[Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies]].

The VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System is affiliated with the U-M Medical School. All physicians who practice at VA hospital and clinics have U-M faculty appointments. Medical students receive training at the VA as part of their internal medicine rotation, but can also receive training there in other specialties as part of other rotations and elective rotations.

===Affiliations with Other Organizations===
To address the changing environment under health care reform, the University of Michigan Health System has developed affiliations with other regional health systems.

==Institutional milestones==
*'''1848''' The Board of Regents establishes a three-member medical department, known today as the U-M Medical School.
*'''1850''' The Medical School opens its doors to more than 100 students. They are charged $5 a year for two years of education.
*'''1852''' Ninety young physicians receive medical diplomas from the U-M.
*'''1867''' Overall University enrollment reaches an all-time high of 1,255 students; 525 of the students are enrolled in the Medical School.
*'''1869''' U-M opens the first university-owned medical facility in the United States. The 20-bed hospital is located in the residence of a former professor. It has no wards or operating rooms.

*'''1986''' A new 11-story, 550-bed adult general University Hospital replaces the old University Hospital. The A. Alfred Taubman Health Care Center, which houses 120 outpatient clinics, is connected to the facility. M-CARE, a managed care organization offering health plans to University staff and faculty, and to employers in southern Michigan, is launched.
*'''1990''' The expansion of the U-M Hospitals continues with the opening of integrated services for children and women in {{convert|221000|sqft|m2}} of new space and renovated units in existing hospitals.
*'''1997''' The Board of Regents officially approves "University of Michigan Health System" as a designation for the U-M Hospitals and Health Centers, Medical School, M-CARE and Michigan Health Corp. Also this year, the U-M moves its cancer and geriatrics clinical and research programs into the $88 million Cancer Center and Geriatrics Center Building, establishes the Center for Gene Therapy and enhances resources for the Center for Organogenesis.
*'''2001''' The National Institutes of Health awards a record $203 million to the U-M. In addition, this year, the U-M establishes the nation's first comprehensive Depression Center.
*'''2003''' The U-M breaks ground for a state-of-the-art clinical building for the Cardiovascular Center on the former site of the "Old Main" Hospital, to provide space for clinical care, research and teaching activities focused on the entire spectrum of cardiovascular disease.

*'''2004''' The largest gift ever given to the Health System, $44 million from Bill and Dee Brehm, is announced; it includes funds for the Brehm Center for Type 1 Diabetes Research and Analysis, a new Michigan Comprehensive Diabetes Center, faculty positions, and a research facility to be built as part of the expansion of the Kellogg Eye Center.
*'''2005''' A new Master Plan and Strategic Direction for UMHS are introduced, forming a framework for continued growth to meet the new challenges of the health care and research environment. Additionally, a group of medical students inaugurate the "Giant Burrito Challenge," consisting of a race to finish the gargantuan namesake from Big Ten Burrito (now known as BTB Burrito).
*'''2006''' The sale of M-CARE to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and its Blue Care Network is finalized. The East Ann Arbor Surgery and Medical Procedures Center, Rachel Upjohn Building (including the U-M Depression Center) and Biomedical Science Research Building open.
*'''2007''' U-M and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan launch Michigan HealthQuarters, a joint venture formed after the sale of M-CARE as a "center for healthcare quality and transformation.” The U-M Cardiovascular Center opens in June and receives an anonymous $50 million donation.
*'''2010''' U-M announces the creation of a stem-cell line—named UM4-6 -- joining fewer than 12 institutions nationally which have done so. This advance was made possible by Michigan voters’ November 2008 approval of a state constitutional amendment permitting scientists in Michigan to derive embryonic stem cell lines using surplus embryos from fertility clinics.
*'''2011''' U-M announces the creation of two new stem lines. One line carries the genetic mutations that cause hemophilia B, a hereditary condition in which the blood does not clot properly while the second carries genes for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which leads to degeneration of muscles in the foot, lower leg and hand. U-M will submit these disease-specific lines to the National Institutes of Health to be placed on the Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry. Researchers across the country will be able to use the lines for federally funded research.<ref name="umhshistory">{{cite web| url=http://www.med.umich.edu/1busi/history.htm| title=History of the University of Michigan Health System| publisher=University Health System| accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref><ref name="medschool">{{cite web| url=http://www.medicineatmichigan.org/sesqui/timeline/index.asp | title=Timeline | publisher=University of Michigan Medical School| accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref>
