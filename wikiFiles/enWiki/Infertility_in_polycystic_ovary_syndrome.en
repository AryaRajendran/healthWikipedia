==Pathophysiology==
Not all women with PCOS have difficulty becoming pregnant.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} For those who do, [[anovulation]] is a common cause. The mechanism of this anovulation is uncertain, but there is evidence of arrested [[antral follicle]] development, which, in turn, may be caused by abnormal interaction of insulin and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) on [[granulosa cells]].<ref name=gorry2006/>

Endocrine disruption may also directly decrease fertility, such as changed levels of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]],<ref name=Brot2010/> [[gonadotropins]] (especially an increase in [[luteinizing hormone]]),<ref name=Brot2010>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.cmet.2010.06.010}}</ref><ref name=firstaid>{{cite book |author=Deepak A.

This will reduce the overstimulation of gonadotroph cells in pituitary.<ref name="Brot2010"/>

==Diagnosis==
PCOS usually causes infertility associated with anovulation, and therefore, the presence of ovulation indicates absence of infertility, although it does not rule out infertility by other causes.

===Ovulation prediction===
Ovulation may be predicted by the use of urine tests that detect the preovulatory [[LH surge]], called ovulation predictor kits (OPKs). However, OPKs are not always accurate when testing on women with PCOS.<ref name="Experts 123">{{cite web|url=http://www.experts123.com/q/question-about-opks-with-pcos.html|title=Question about opks with pcos|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>  Charting of [[cervical mucus]] may also be used to predict ovulation, or certain [[fertility monitors]] (those that track urinary hormones or changes in saliva) may be used.  Methods that predict ovulation may be used to time intercourse or insemination appropriately.

While not useful for predicting ovulation,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Guermandi E, Vegetti W, Bianchi MM, Uglietti A, Ragni G, Crosignani P |title=Reliability of ovulation tests in infertile women |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=92–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11152915 |doi= 10.1016/S0029-7844(00)01083-8|url=http://www.greenjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11152915 |format= &ndash; <sup>[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3AReliability+of+ovulation+tests+in+infertile+women&as_publication=Obstet+Gynecol&as_ylo=2001&as_yhi=2001&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup>}} {{Dead link|date=December 2008}}</ref> [[basal body temperature]]s may be used to confirm ovulation.  Ovulation may also be confirmed by testing for serum [[progesterone]] in mid-luteal phase, approximately seven days after ovulation (if ovulation occurred on the average cycle day of fourteen, seven days later would be cycle day 21).  A mid-luteal phase progesterone test may also be used to diagnose [[luteal phase]] defect.  Methods that confirm ovulation may be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments to stimulate ovulation.

==Management==
Management of infertility in polycystic ovary syndrome includes lifestyle modification as well as [[assisted reproductive technology]] such as ovulation induction, oocyte release triggering and surgery.

===Lifestyle modification===
For overweight women with PCOS who are anovulatory, diet adjustments and weight loss are associated with resumption of spontaneous ovulation.

===Ovulation induction===
For those who after weightloss still are anovulatory or for anovulatory lean women, [[ovulation induction]] to reverse the anovulation is the principal treatment used to help infertility in PCOS.  [[Clomiphene citrate]] is the main medication used for this purpose, and is the first-line treatment in subfertile anovulatory patients with PCOS.<ref name=ESHRE2012/> [[Gonadotrophin]]s such as [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) are, in addition to surgery, second-line treatments.<ref name=ESHRE2012/> [[Aromatase inhibitor]]s show promising results.<ref name=ESHRE2012/>

===In vitro fertilization===
For patients who do not respond to diet, lifestyle modification and clomiphene, [[in vitro fertilisation]] can be performed. This usually includes [[controlled ovarian hyperstimulation]] with [[follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]] injections, and [[oocyte release triggering]] with [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) or a [[GnRH agonist]].

===Surgery===
Surgery can be attempted in case of inefficient result with medications for ovulation induction.<ref name=ESHRE2012/> Though surgery is not commonly performed, the polycystic ovaries can be treated with a laparoscopic procedure called "ovarian drilling" (puncture of 4-10 small follicles with electrocautery), which often results in either resumption of spontaneous ovulations or ovulations after adjuvant treatment with clomiphene or [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]].

===Inefficacy of metformin===
Previously, metformin was recommended treatment for anovulation.

A [[systematic review]] and [[meta-analysis]] in 2012<ref name=Misso2012/> came to the conclusion that there is insufficient evidence to establish a difference between metformin and clomiphene citrate in terms of ovulation, pregnancy, live birth, miscarriage and multiple pregnancy rates in women with PCOS and a BMI less than 32&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=Misso2012>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dms036}}</ref> It emphasized that a lack of superiority of one treatment is not evidence for equivalence.<ref name=Misso2012/>

Another review in 2012<ref name=Tang2012/> came to the conclusion that metformin improves [[pregnancy rate]]s in women with PCOS when compared with placebo, and in addition to clomiphene compared with clomiphene alone, but not when compared directly with clomiphene. Also, however, it came to the conclusion that metformin does not improve [[live birth rate]]s whether it is used alone or in combination with clomiphene. It therefore concluded that the benefit of metformin in the improvement of reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS appears limited.<ref name=Tang2012>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dms040}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
PCOS causes an increased time to pregnancy but the eventual family size is not necessarily reduced.<ref name=ESHRE2012>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dms019}}</ref> The frequency of [[miscarriage]] does not appear to be increased.<ref name=ESHRE2012/>
