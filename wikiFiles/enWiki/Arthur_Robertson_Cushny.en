Physician '''Arthur Robertson Cushny''' (6 March 1866 – 25 February 1926), was a Scottish pharmacologist and physiologist who became a Fellow of the Royal Society. 

Cushny was born on 6 March 1866 in [[Fochabers]], [[Moray]], [[Scotland]]. He attended a local rural school until he enrolled at the [[University of Aberdeen]] and received an [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|M.A.]] in 1866. Then in 1889 he graduated from medical studies at [[Marischal College]], [[Aberdeen]], receiving C.M., M.B. and [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degrees in 1892.<ref name="Dictionary of American Biography">{{cite book | title = Dictionary of American Biography, Vol. III | publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons | location = New York | date = 1959}}</ref>

Aroused by interests of physiological drug interaction, he traveled to the European continent and spent a year of associated study under Oswald Schmiedeberg at [[Straßburg, Austria|Strassburg]], [[Austria]] and six months in [[Berne]] under [[Hugo Kronecker]], from whom he learned elements of physiological technique.<ref name="Dictionary of American Biography"/>

Then in 1893, at age 27, he accepted the chairmanship of [[pharmacology]] at the [[University of Michigan]], replacing the newly resigned Professor J. J. Abel. While there he taught, conducted research and wrote his ''Text-Book of Pharmacology'' and ''Therapeutics'', an unrivaled book for thirty years with a posthumous edition published in 1928.<ref name="Dictionary of American Biography"/>

Cushny's contributions to the field of pharmacology were considerable. He performed, with the most modern techniques of the time, the first experimental analysis of the action of [[Digoxin|digitalis]] on warm-blooded animals and  explained its effects, thereby increasing the drug's therapeutic use and value.<ref name="Dictionary of American Biography"/> He was the first to understand the similarity between clinical and experimental auricular [[fibrillation]].<ref name="Dictionary of American Biography"/> 

He was also interested for several years in the physiological action of [[Chirality (chemistry)|optical isomers]] and, in [[Circa|c.]] 1900, the mechanisms of kidney secretion, providing three advanced papers on the subject between 1901 and 1904 in the ''Journal of Physiology''. In 1917 he presented the paper,''The Secretion of Urine'', an advancement of the "modern theory" of kidney secretion, and also wrote a second edition of it released posthumously. Here he laid aside the theories of the inexplicable vital activities of the kidneys. He claimed that their primary structures, the [[Glomerulus|Glomeruli]], simply filter out harmful bodily waste products while useful nutrients are reabsorbed into the body.<ref name="Dictionary of American Biography"/>

In 1905 he accepted the chair of pharmacology at [[University College London]] (UCL), and then in 1918, replaced the chair vacated by [[Thomas Richard Fraser|Sir Thomas Fraser]] in Edinburgh, where remained until his death.<ref name="Dictionary of American Biography"/>

While in Edinburgh, he bought an historic manor house, the "Dumbiedykes" of the ''Heart of Midlothian'', that he retired to while entertaining international medical students and physicians.<ref name="Dictionary of American Biography"/> He was an avid [[horticulture|horticulturalist]], spending more and more time in his garden. He married the English Sarah Firbank in 1896, and died of sudden apoplectic stroke at his home in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] on 25 February 1926.<ref name="Dictionary of American Biography"/>
