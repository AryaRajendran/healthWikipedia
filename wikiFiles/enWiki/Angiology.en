'''Angiology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:ἀγγεῖον|ἀγγεῖον]]}}, ''angeīon'', "vessel"; and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') is the medical specialty which studies the diseases of the [[circulatory system]] and of the [[lymphatic system]], i.e., [[arteries]], [[veins]] and lymphatic vases, and its [[diseases]].  In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] this field is more often termed ''angiology'', and in the [[United States]] the term ''vascular medicine'' is more frequent.

Most leading causes of death in the modern world are related to blood vessel pathology.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The field of vascular medicine (angiology) is the field that deals with preventing, diagnosing and treating vascular and blood vessel related diseases.

Arterial diseases include the [[aorta]] (aneurysms/dissection) and arteries supplying the legs hands, kidneys, brain, intestines.  It also covers arterial [[thrombosis]] and [[embolism]]; [[vasculitides]]; and [[vasospasm|vasospastic disorder]]s.  Naturally, it deals with preventing cardio - vascular diseases such as [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[stroke]].  Venous diseases include venous thrombosis, chronic [[venous insufficiency]], and [[varicose vein]]s.  Lymphatic diseases include primary and secondary forms of [[lymphedema]].  It also involves modification of risk factors for vascular disease like high [[cholesterol]], high [[blood pressure]].

Cardiovascular risk factors such [[high blood pressure]], elevated [[cholesterol]] and others fall under the specialty of vascular medicine. Hence a vascular medicine specialist should be able to address most of the major diseases in our age in a comprehensive manner, using a unique perspective.

==Vascular medicine training==
In [[Europe]], vascular medicine (angiology) training is well established, especially in [[France]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[Netherlands]]. In the [[United States]] there are several independent vascular medicine training programs and twelve NIH funded three-year programs as well.  These programs are suitable for either [[Internal medicine]] specialists as a [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] or for [[cardiologists]]. In 2005, the first vascular medicine boards were administered by the [[American Board of Vascular Medicine]].
