[[File:HippocraticOath.jpg|thumb|The [[Hippocratic Oath]] is an oath traditionally taken by physicians pertaining to the ethical practice of [[medicine]]. It is widely believed that the oath was written by [[Hippocrates]], the father of western medicine, in the 4th century BC, or by one of his students]]
A '''medical encyclopedia''' is a comprehensive written compendium that holds information about [[diseases]], [[medical conditions]], tests, [[symptoms]], [[injuries]], and [[surgeries]]. It may contain an extensive gallery of medicine-related photographs and illustrations.

Four major elements define a medical encyclopaedia: its subject matter, its scope, its method of organization, and its method of production:
* Encyclopaedias can be general, containing articles on topics in every field.  A medical encyclopedia provides valuable health information, tools for managing your health, and support to those who seek information.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/about-webmd-policies/default.htm?ss=ftr|title=Medical Encyclopedia WebMD| date=17 May 2009}} About WebMD.</ref>
* Works of encyclopedic scope aim to convey the important accumulated knowledge for their subject domain, such as an encyclopaedia of medicine.
* The articles on subjects in a medical encyclopedia are usually accessed alphabetically by article name or for health topics.
* As modern multimedia and the information age have evolved, they have had an ever-increasing effect on the collection, verification, summation, and presentation of information of all kinds. Medical encyclopedias such as [[Medline Plus]], [[WebMD]], and the [[Merck Manual]] are examples of new forms of the medical encyclopedias as information retrieval becomes simpler.  Some online encyclopedias, such as [[Medpedia]], use [[wiki software]] to write the information collaboratively.

The U.S. National Library of Medicine produces and maintains MedlinePlus.
