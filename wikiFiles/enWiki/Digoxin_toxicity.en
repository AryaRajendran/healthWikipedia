'''Digoxin toxicity''' is a [[poison]]ing that occurs when excess doses of [[digoxin]] (from plants of the genus ''[[Digitalis]]'') are consumed acutely or over an extended period.  The classic features of digoxin toxicity are nonspecific: fatigue, blurred vision, change in color vision (e.g. "yellow vision"), anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, confusion, delirium. 

Characteristic EKG changes include [[bradycardia]] (the most frequent [[vital sign]] abnormality in toxicity), a prolonged [[PR interval]]. An accelerated [[junctional rhythm]] or bidirectional [[ventricular tachycardia]] suggests digoxin toxicity until proven otherwise.

==Classification==
[[File:DigToxCrop.jpg|thumb|An ECG showing digoxin toxicity with the classic "scooped out" ST segment]]
Digoxin toxicity is often divided into acute or chronic. The therapeutic level for digoxin is 0.5-2 ng/mL. Low serum potassium increases the risk of digoxin toxicity and cardiac dysrhythmias. The classic arrhythmia is a paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with block. Digoxin toxicity occurs because it is very easy to overdose. Overdose commonly occurs because its therapeutic effect works only within a very narrow window. The most common source of digoxin is from the [[Digitalis purpurea|Foxglove plant]].

==Symptoms==
Symptoms include hypersalivation, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, changes in heart rate and rhythm, loss of appetite ([[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]]), diarrhea, visual disturbances (yellow or green halos around objects), confusion, dizziness, nightmares, agitation, and/or depression, as well as a higher acute sense of sensual activities.

==Treatment==
[[File:Digibind.jpg|thumb|Digoxin immune Fab used to treat digoxin toxicity]]
The primary treatment of digoxin toxicity is [[digoxin immune Fab]]. Digoxin should not be given if the apical heart rate is below 60 BPM (beats per minute).

Other treatment that may be tried to treat life-threatening arrhythmias, until digoxin Immune Fab is acquired are [[magnesium]], [[phenytoin]], and [[lidocaine]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1578 |title=BestBets: In digoxin induced life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmia what pharmacotherapy, other than Fab, should be implemented? |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Atropine is also used in cases of bradyarrhythmias.
