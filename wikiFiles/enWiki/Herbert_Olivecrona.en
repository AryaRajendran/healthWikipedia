'''Axel Herbert Olivecrona''' (July 11, 1891 – January 1980) was a Swedish professor and [[brain surgeon]], credited with founding the field of Swedish neurosurgery,<ref name="NCBI">{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8416233|journal=[[Journal of Neurosurgery]]|publisher=NCBI|title=Herbert Olivecrona: founder of Swedish neurosurgery|date=January 1993|volume=78|pages=142&ndash;149}}</ref> and pioneering developments in modern neurosurgery.

== Family, early life and education == 
Herbert Olivecrona was born July 11, 1891 in [[Visby, Sweden]], the son of Axel Olivecrona, a district court judge, and Countess Ebba Cristina Mörner af Morlanda. His brother [[Karl Olivecrona]] was a noted Swedish attorney, and his son Gustaf Olivecrona a Swedish writer and journalist.<ref name="SocietyNS"/>

Originally attending school in [[Uppsala]], he began studying medicine at the [[University of Uppsala]] in 1909, then transferring to the Karolinska Institut, where he was an assistant in Pathology. He graduated in 1918.<ref name="SocietyNS"/>

== Medical career ==
In 1919, Olivecrona received a fellowship from the [[American-Scandinavian Foundation]]. This allowed him to engage in experimental work at the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins Institute]] in Baltimore, Maryland, where he worked with surgery pioneer [[Harvey Williams Cushing|Harvey Cushing]] (1869&ndash;1939). Olivecrona was offered a residency, and to be Cushing's foreign assistant on the condition that he work for a year at [[Pierre Marie]]'s clinic in Paris. Due to financial reasons, Olivecrona declined and returned to Sweden, where, as the only neurosurgeon in the city interested in brain tumors, he established the first neurosurgery program at Serafimer Hospital in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Herbert Olivecrona 1891-1980|author=Horwitz, NH|journal=''[[Neurosurgery (journal)|Neurosurgery]]''|date=1998}}</ref> After further consultation with Cushing, Olivecrona improved his skills, and in 1930 was promoted to the position of assistant surgeon in chief, allowing him to establish a 50-bed neurosurgery department.<ref name="SocietyNS"/>

In 1935, he became the first professor of neurosurgery at the [[Karolinska Institutet|Karolinska Institute]], quite likely the first chair of neurosurgery in all of Europe.<ref name="SocietyNS">{{cite web|title=Herbert Olivecrona, MD|publisher=The Society of Neurological Surgeons|url=http://www.societyns.org/society/bio.aspx?MemberID=7636|accessdate=May 7, 2012|date=2008}}</ref> Olivecrona was a pioneer in the creation of specific surgical techniques for certain types of brain lesions such as [[acoustic neuroma]]s, [[arteriovenous malformation]]s, and berry [[aneurysm]]s, becoming one of the key neurosurgical instructors in Europe.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Department of Neurosurgery, Karolinska Institute: 60 Years|date=November 1996|volume=39|issue=5|pages=1016&ndash;1021|journal=''Neurosurgery''|url=http://journals.lww.com/neurosurgery/Abstract/1996/11000/Department_of_Neurosurgery,_Karolinska_Institute_.26.aspx|accessdate=May 8, 2012}}</ref> One of his students, [[Lars Leksell]] (1907&ndash;1986), went on to make major advances in the development of [[echoencephalography]], and is credited with the invention of [[radiosurgery]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Ultrasound in clinical diagnosis|editor=Eklof, Bo; Lindstrom, Kjell; Persson, Stig|author=Salford, Leif|chapter=The development of echoencephalography in Sweden|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2012|isbn=978-0-199-60207-0}}</ref>

Among his most famous patients was the Hungarian writer [[Frigyes Karinthy]], whose brain tumor he operated on in 1936. Karinthy put it into a novel titled "A Journey Round my Skull."

In 1955, Olivecrona was elected as a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. He retired from the Karolinska in 1960 and went into private practice, during which time he also accepted an invitation to travel to Cairo and establish a neurosurgical unit in Egypt. He later co-wrote a neurosurgical handbook, ''Handbook der Neurochirugie''.<ref name="SocietyNS"/> Olivecrona died in January 1980.<ref name="CNS">{{cite web|url=http://www.cns.org/about/history/honoredGuests/default.aspx?inID=1952 |title=Honored Guests&nbsp;– Herbert Olivecrona |publisher=Congress of Neurological Surgeons |accessdate=May 7, 2012}}</ref>

The Herbert Olivecrona Award, also known as the "Nobel Prize of Neurosurgery", is awarded annually by the Karolinska Institute to a neurosurgeon or neuroscientist who has made an outstanding contribution to the neurosurgical field.<ref name="UHN">{{cite web|url=http://www.uhn.ca/applications/iNews/ViewStory.aspx?s_id=449|publisher=University Health Network|title=Neurosurgeon awarded top prize in his field|accessdate=May 6, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Olivecrona">{{cite web|title=Olivecrona Lecturers|url=http://www.olivecrona.eu/handlers/fetchfile.ashx?file=4c6e86c3-6b95-40ee-92cf-151434461976|date=2011|publisher=Karolinska Institutet|format=pdf|accessdate=May 6, 2012}}</ref>
