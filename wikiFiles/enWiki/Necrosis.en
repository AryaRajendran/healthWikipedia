'''Necrosis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wikt:νεκρός|νεκρός]]'', "dead", ''νέκρωσις'', "death, the stage of dying, the act of killing") is  a form of [[cell injury]] that results in the premature [[death]] of [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in living [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]].<ref name="Proskuryakov">Proskuryakov, S. Y. a., Konoplyannikov, A. G. & Gabai, V. L. Necrosis: a specific form of programmed cell death? Experimental Cell Research 283, 1-16, doi:10.1016/s0014-4827(02)00027-7 (2003).</ref> Necrosis is caused by factors external to the cell or tissue, such as infection, toxins, or trauma that result in the unregulated digestion of cell components. In contrast, [[apoptosis]] is a naturally occurring programmed and targeted cause of cellular death. While apoptosis often provides beneficial effects to the organism, necrosis is almost always detrimental and can be fatal.<ref name="Kasper">Kasper D.L., Zaleznik D.F. (2001). Gas gangrene, antibiotic associated colitis, and other Clostridial infections. In Braunwald E., Kasper D.L. et.al (Eds). Harrisons’s principles of internal McGraw Hill, New York</ref>

Cells that die due to necrosis do not follow the apoptotic signal transduction pathway but rather various receptors are activated that result in the loss of cell membrane integrity and an uncontrolled release of products of cell death into the intracellular space.<ref name="Proskuryakov"/> This initiates an inflammatory response in the surrounding tissue: Nearby [[phagocytes]]  are prevented from locating and [[Phagocytosis|engulfing]] the dead cells.<ref name="Kasper"/> The result is a build-up of dead tissue and cell debris at, or near, the site of the cell death. A classic example is [[gangrene]]. For this reason, it is often necessary to remove necrotic tissue surgically, a process known as [[debridement]].

==Classification==

Necrosis is the sum of cell changes after localized cellular death through a process known as [[autolysis]]. Structural signs that indicate irreversible cell injury and the progression of necrosis include: dense clumping and progressive disruption of [[gene]]tic material: and disruption to membranes of cells and [[organelles]].<ref name="Craft">Craft, J. et al. Understanding Pathophysiology. 1 edn,  (Mosby Elsevier, 2011).</ref>

===Morphological patterns===

There are five distinctive morphological patterns of necrosis:

# [[Coagulative necrosis]] is characterized by the formation of a gelatinous (gel-like) substance in dead tissues in which the architecture of the tissue is maintained,<ref name="Kumar">Kumar, V., Abbas, A. K., Fausto, N. & Aster, J. C. Robbins and Cotran Pathological Basis of Disease. 8 edn,  (Saunders Elseveir, 2010).</ref> and can be observed by light microscopy. Coagulation occurs as a result of protein [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]], causing the [[albumin]] in protein to form a firm and opaque state.<ref name="Craft"/> This pattern of necrosis is typically seen in [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] (low-oxygen) environments, such as [[infarction]]. Coagulative necrosis occurs primarily in tissues such the kidney, heart and adrenal glands.<ref name="Craft"/> Severe [[ischemia]] most commonly causes necrosis of this form.<ref name="McConnell">McConnell, T. H. The Nature of Disease: Pathology for the Health Professional.  (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2007).</ref>
# 
# [[Liquefactive necrosis]] (or colliquative necrosis), in contrast to coagulative necrosis, is characterized by the digestion of dead cells to form a viscous liquid mass.<ref name="Kumar"/> This is typical of bacterial, or sometimes fungal, infections because of their ability to stimulate an inflammatory response. The necrotic liquid mass is frequently creamy yellow due to the presence of dead [[leukocyte]]s and is commonly known as [[pus]].<ref name="Kumar"/> [[Hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxic]] [[Infarction|infarcts]] in the brain presents as this type of necrosis, because the brain contains little connective tissue but high amounts of digestive enzymes and lipids, and cells therefore can be readily digested by their own enzymes.<ref name="Craft"/>
# 
# [[Caseous necrosis]] can be considered a combination of coagulative and liquefactive necroses,<ref name="Craft"/> typically caused by [[mycobacteria]] (e.g. [[tuberculosis]]), fungi and some foreign substances. The necrotic tissue appears as white and [[friable]], like clumped cheese. Dead cells disintegrate but are not completely digested, leaving granular particles.<ref name="Craft"/> Microscopic examination shows [[amorphous]] granular debris enclosed within a distinctive inflammatory border.<ref name="Kumar"/> [[Granuloma]] has this characteristic.<ref name="Stevens">Stevens, A., Lowe, J. S. & Young, B. Wheater's Basic Histopathology: A Colour Atlas and Text. 4 edn,  (Churchill Livingstone, 2003)</ref> 
# 
# [[Fat necrosis]] is specialized necrosis of fat tissue,<ref name="Stevens"/> resulting from the action of activated [[lipase]]s on fatty tissues such as the [[pancreas]]. In the pancreas it leads to acute [[pancreatitis]], a condition where the [[pancreatic enzymes]] leak out into the [[peritoneum|peritoneal]] cavity, and liquefy the membrane by splitting the [[triglyceride]] esters into [[fatty acids]] through fat [[saponification]].<ref name="Kumar"/> Calcium, magnesium or sodium may bind to these lesions to produce a chalky-white substance.<ref name="Craft"/> The calcium deposits are microscopically distinctive and may be large enough to be visible on radiographic examinations.<ref name="McConnell"/> To the naked eye, calcium deposits appear as gritty white flecks.<ref name="McConnell"/> 
# 
# [[Fibrinoid necrosis]] is a special form of necrosis usually caused by immune-mediated vascular damage. It is marked by complexes of [[antigen]] and [[antibodies]], sometimes referred to as “immune complexes” deposited within [[artery|arterial]] walls<ref name="Kumar"/> together with [[fibrin]].<ref name="Kumar"/>

===Other clinical classifications of necrosis===

# There are also very specific forms of necrosis such as [[gangrene]] (term used in clinical practices for limbs which have suffered severe hypoxia), [[gummatous]] necrosis (due to [[spirochaete|spirochaetal]] infections) and hemorrhagic necrosis (due to the blockage of venous drainage of an organ or tissue). 
# 
# Some [[spider bite]]s may lead to necrosis. In the United States, only spider bites from the [[brown recluse spider]] (genus [[Loxosceles]]) have been proven to cause necrosis. Other spiders of the same genus such as the [[Chilean recluse]] in South America, have similarly been shown to cause necrosis in other countries. While both the [[yellow sac spider]]s and [[Hobo spider]] are often claimed to possess necrotic [[venom]], these claims have been challenged.
# 
# In blind mole rats (genus ''[[Spalax]]''), the process of necrosis replaces the role of the systematic [[apoptosis]] normally used in many organisms. Low oxygen conditions, such as those common in blind mole rats’ burrows, usually cause cells to undergo apoptosis. In adaptation to higher tendency of cell death, blind mole rats evolved a mutation in the [[tumor suppressor]] protein [[p53]] (which is also used in humans) to prevent cells from undergoing apoptosis. Human cancer patients have similar mutations, and blind mole rats were thought to be more susceptible to cancer because their cells cannot undergo apoptosis. However, after a specific amount of time (within 3 days according to a study conducted at the University of Rochester), the cells in blind mole rats release [[interferon-beta]] (which the immune system normally uses to counter viruses) in response to over-proliferation of cells caused by the suppression of apoptosis. In this case, the interferon-beta triggers cells to undergo necrosis, and this mechanism also kills cancer cells in blind mole rats. Because of tumor suppression mechanisms such as this, blind mole rats and other [[spalacid]]s are resistant to cancer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Saey|first=Tina Hesman|title=Cancer cells self-destruct in blind mole rats|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/346267/description/Cancer_cells_self-destruct_in_blind_mole_rats|work=[[Science News]]|publisher=[[Society for Science and the Public]]|accessdate=27 November 2012|date=5 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1073/pnas.1217211109}} Retrieved 27 November 2012</ref>

==Causes==
[[File:Necrotic leg wound.png|thumb|right|Necrotic leg wound caused by a [[brown recluse spider bite]]]]

Necrosis may occur due to external or internal factors. External factors may involve mechanical trauma, physical damage to the body (that causes cellular breakdown), any damage to blood vessels (which may disrupt the blood supply to that area); and ischemia.<ref name="Raffray">Raffray, M. & Gerald M, C. Apoptosis and necrosis in toxicology: A continuum or distinct modes of cell death? Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics 75, 153-177, doi:10.1016/s0163-7258(97)00037-5 (1997).</ref>  Thermal effects (extremely high or low temperature) can result in necrosis due to the disruption of cells. In [[frostbite]], crystals form, increasing the pressure of remaining tissue and fluid causing the cells to burst.<ref name="Raffray"/> Under extreme conditions tissues and cells die through an unregulated process of destruction of membranes and cytosol.<ref name="Nzarian">Nazarian, R. M., Van Cott, E. M., Zembowicz, A. & Duncan, L. M. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology 61, 325-332, doi:10.1016/j.jaad.2008.12.039 (2009).</ref>
 
Internal factors causing necrosis include [http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/trophoneurosis trophoneurotic] disorders; injury and paralysis of nerve cells. Pancreatic enzymes (lipases) are the major cause of fat necrosis.<ref name="Raffray"/>
Necrosis can be activated by [[bacterial toxin]]s and components of the immune system, such as the [[complement system]], activated [[natural killer cells]], and [[peritoneal]] [[macrophage]]s.<ref name="Proskuryakov">Proskuryakov, S. Y. a., Konoplyannikov, A. G. & Gabai, V. L. Necrosis: a specific form of programmed cell death? Experimental Cell Research 283, 1-16, doi:10.1016/s0014-4827(02)00027-7 (2003)</ref> Pathogen-induced necrosis programs in cells with immunological barriers ([[intestinal mucosa]]) may alleviate invasion of [[pathogen]]s through surfaces affected by inflammation.<ref name="Proskuryakov"/> Toxins and pathogens may cause necrosis; toxins such as [[snake venom]]s may inhibit enzymes and cause cell death.<ref name="Raffray"/>

[[Pathological]] conditions are characterized by inadequate secretion of [[cytokines]]. [[Nitric oxide]] (NO) and [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) are also accompanied by intense necrotic death of cells.<ref name="Raffray"/>  A classic example of a necrotic condition is ischemia that leads to a drastic depletion of [[oxygen]], [[glucose]] and other [http://cellbiology.med.unsw.edu.au/units/science/project2004/Celldeathregulation.htm trophic factors] and evokes massive necrotic death of endothelial cells and non-proliferating cells of surrounding tissues (neurons, cardiomyocytes, renal cells, etc.).<ref name="Proskuryakov"/> Recent [[Cell biology|cytological]] data indicates that necrotic death occurs not only during pathological events but it is also a component of some [[physiological]] process.<ref name="Raffray"/>

Activation-induced death of primary [[T-lymphocytes]], and important constituents of the immune response, are [[caspase]]-independent and necrotic by morphology; hence current researchers have demonstrated that the occurrence of necrotic cell death can not only occur during pathological processes but also during normal processes such as tissue renewal, [[embryogenesis]] and immune response.<ref name="Raffray"/>

==Pathogenesis==

Until recently, necrosis was thought to be an unregulated process.<ref name="Kroemer">http://www.nature.com/cdd/journal/v16/n1/pdf/cdd2008150a.pdf</ref> There are two broad pathways in which necrosis may occur in an organism.<ref name="Kroemer"/>

The first of these two pathways initially involves [[oncosis]], where swelling of the cells occur.<ref name="Kroemer"/> The cell then proceeds to [[blebbing]], and this is followed by [[pyknosis]], in which nuclear shrinkage transpires.<ref name="Kroemer"/> In the final step of this pathway the nucleus is dissolved into the cytoplasm, which is referred to as [[karyorrhexis]].<ref name="Kroemer"/>

The second pathway is a secondary form of necrosis that is shown to occur after apoptosis and budding.<ref name="Kroemer"/> Cellular changes of necrosis occur in this secondary form of apoptosis, where the nucleus breaks into fragments, which is known as [[karyolysis]].<ref name="Kroemer"/>

===Cellular changes===

The nucleus changes in necrosis and characteristics of this change are determined by the way in which the DNA is broken down, as shown in figure 3. There are three different ways in which the DNA can be broken down, which are; karyolysis, pyknosis and karyorrhexis.<ref name="Kumar"/>

Karyolysis is a process where the [[chromatin]] of the nucleus fades due to the loss of the DNA by degradation.<ref name="Kumar"/> 
Pyknosis is where the nucleus shrinks and the chromatin in the nucleus condenses.<ref name="Kumar"/>
Karyorrhexis follows on from the process of pyknosis, and involves the shrunken nucleus proceeding to fragmentation until the nucleus completely disappears.<ref name="Kumar"/> 

Plasma alterations are also seen in necrosis. Plasma membranes appear discontinuous when viewed with an electron microscope. This discontinuous membrane is caused by cell blebbing and the loss of [[microvilli]].<ref name="Kumar"/>

==Treatment==

There are many causes of necrosis, and as such treatment is based upon how the necrosis came about. Treatment of necrosis typically involves two distinct processes. Usually, the underlying cause of the necrosis must be treated before the dead tissue itself can be dealt with.

•	In the case of [[ischemia]], which includes [[myocardial infarction]], the restriction of blood supply to tissues causes [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and the creation of [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) that react with, and damage proteins and membranes. [[Antioxidant]] treatments can be applied to scavenge the ROS.<ref name="Eum">Eum, H.-A., Cha, Y.-N. & Lee, S.-M. Necrosis and apoptosis: Sequence of liver damage following reperfusion after 60 min ischemia in rats. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 358, 500-505, doi:10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.04.153 (2007)</ref>

•	Wounds caused by physical agents, including direct physical [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] and injury, can be treated with [[antibiotics]] and [[anti-inflammatory]] drugs to prevent bacterial infection and inflammation. Keeping the wound clean from infection also prevents necrosis.

•	Chemical and toxic agents (e.g. pharmaceutical drugs, acids, bases) react with the skin leading to skin loss and eventually necrosis. Treatment involves identification and discontinuation of the harmful agent, followed by treatment of the wound, including prevention of infection and possibly the use of [[immunosuppressive]] therapies such as [[anti-inflammatory drugs]] or immunosuppressants.<ref name="Cooper">Cooper, K. L. Skin and Wound Care. Drug Reaction, Skin Care, Skin Loss. Crit. Care Nurse 32, 52-59, doi:10.4037/ccn2012340 (2012)</ref> In the example of a [[snake bite]], the use of [[anti-venom]] halts the spread of toxins whilst receiving [[antibiotics]] to impede infection.<ref name="Chrotenimitkhum">Chotenimitkhun, R. & Rojnuckarin, P.

Even after the initial cause of the necrosis has been halted, the necrotic tissue will remain in the body. The body's immune response to apoptosis, which involves the automatic breaking down and recycling of cellular material, is not triggered by necrotic cell death due to the apoptotic pathway being disabled.<ref name="Edinger">Edinger, A. L. & Thompson, C. B. Death by design: apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 16, 663-669, doi:10.1016/j.ceb.2004.09.011 (2004).</ref>
The standard therapy for necrosis is removal of the dead tissue ([[debridement]]) either by surgical or non-surgical means. Depending on the severity of the necrosis, this may range from removal of small patches of skin, to complete [[amputation]] of affected limbs or organs. Chemical removal of necrotic tissue is another option in which enzymatic debriding agents, categorised as [[proteolytic]], [[fibrinolytic]] or [[Collagenase|collangenases]], are used to target the various components of dead tissue.<ref name="Anu">Anu, S., Ernane, D. R. & Morris, D. K. Options for nonsurgical debridment of necrotic wounds. Advances in Skin & Wound Care 14, 96-96 (2001).</ref> In select cases, special [[maggot therapy]] using ''[[Lucilia sericata]]'' larvae has been employed to remove necrotic tissue and infection.<ref name="Horobin">Horobin, A.

==In plants==

If calcium is deficient, [[pectin]] cannot be synthesized, and therefore the cell walls cannot be bonded and thus an impediment of the meristems.  This will lead to necrosis of stem and root tips and leaf edges.<ref>Capon, Brian Botany for Gardeners, p. 178, Timber Press, 2010, 3rd edition.</ref>
