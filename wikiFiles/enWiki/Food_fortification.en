'''Food fortification''' or '''enrichment''' is the process of adding [[micronutrient]]s (essential trace elements and vitamins) to [[food]]. It can be purely a commercial choice to provide extra nutrients in a food, or sometimes it is a [[public health]] policy which aims to reduce numbers of people with dietary deficiencies in a population.

Diets that lack variety can be deficient in certain nutrients. Sometimes the [[staple food]]s of a region can lack particular nutrients, due to the soil of a region, or because of the inherent inadequacy of the normal diet.  Addition of micronutrients to staples and condiments can prevent large-scale [[deficiency disease]]s in these cases.<ref>http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/food+fortification</ref>

While it is true that both '''fortification''' and '''enrichment''' refer to the addition of nutrients to food, the true definitions do slightly vary. As defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), '''fortification''' refers to "the practice of deliberately increasing the content of an essential micronutrient, ie. vitamins and minerals (including trace elements) in a food irrespective of whether the nutrients were originally in the food before processing or not, so as to improve the nutritional quality of the food supply and to provide a public health benefit with minimal risk to health," whereas '''enrichment''' is defined as "synonymous with fortification and refers to the addition of micronutrients to a food which are lost during processing."<ref name="WHO-FAO_Guidelines">[http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/guide_food_fortification_micronutrients.pdf World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Guidelines on food fortification with micronutrients.] 2006 [cited on 2011 Oct 30].</ref>

Food fortification was identified as the second strategy of four by the WHO and FAO to begin decreasing the incidence of nutrient deficiencies at the global level.<ref name="WHO-FAO_Guidelines"/>

As outlined by the FAO, the most common fortified foods are:
* Cereals and cereal based products
* Milk and Milk products
*Fats and oils
*Accessory food items
*Tea and other beverages
*Infant formulas<ref>[http://www.fao.org/docrep/W2840E/w2840e0b.htm Micronutrient Fortification of Food: Technology and Quality Control]</ref>

== Types of Food Fortification ==

The 4 main methods of food fortification (named as to indicate the procedure that is used in order to fortify the food):
# [[Biofortification]] (i.e. breeding crops to increase their nutritional value, which can include both conventional selective breeding, and modern genetic modification)
# Microbial biofortification and synthetic biology (i.e. addition of probiotic bacteria to foods)
# Commercial and industrial fortification (i.e. flour, rice, oils (common cooking foods))
# Home fortification (e.g. vitamin D drops)<ref name="CMJ">{{Cite journal |first1=C. |last1=Liyanage |first2=M. |last2=Hettiarachchi |title=Food fortification |journal=Ceylon Medical Journal |year=2011 |volume=56 |pages=124–127 |doi=10.4038/cmj.v56i3.3607 |url=http://www.sljol.info/index.php/CMJ/article/download/3607/2908/3607-12747-1-PB.pdf |issue=3 |pmid=22164753}}</ref>

==Rationale==

The WHO and FAO, among many other nationally recognized organizations, have recognized that there are over 2 billion people worldwide who suffer from a variety of micronutrient deficiencies. In 1992, 159 countries pledged at the FAO/WHO International Conference on Nutrition to make efforts to help combat these issues of micronutrient deficiencies, highlighting the importance of decreasing the number of those with iodine, vitamin A, and iron deficiencies.<ref name="WHO-FAO_Guidelines"/> A significant statistic that led to these efforts was the discovery that approximately 1 in 3 people worldwide were at risk for either an iodine, vitamin A, or iron deficiency. Although it is recognized that food fortification alone will not combat this deficiency, it is a step towards reducing the prevalence of these deficiencies and their associated health conditions<ref>Darnton-Hill, E. (1998). Overview: Rationale and elements of a successful food-fortification programme. Food and Nutrition Bulletin. 19(2):92-100</ref>

In Canada, The Food and Drug Regulations have outlined specific criterion which justifies food fortification:
# To replace nutrients which were lost during manufacturing of the product (i.e. the manufacturing of flour<ref>http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/micronutrients/wheat_maize_fort.pdf</ref>)
# To act as a public health intervention
# To ensure the nutritional equivalence of substitute foods (i.e. to make butter and margarine similar in content, soy milk and cow's milk, etc.)
# To ensure the appropriate vitamin and mineral nutrient composition of foods for special dietary purposes (i.e. Boost, gluten-free products, low sodium, or any other products specifically designed for special dietary requirements from an individual).<ref>http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/alt_formats/hpfb-dgpsa/pdf/nutrition/fortification_factsheet1-eng.pdf</ref>

There are also several advantages to approaching nutrient deficiencies among populations via food fortification as opposed to other methods. These may include, but are not limited to: treating a population without specific dietary interventions therefore not requiring a change in dietary patterns, continuous delivery of the nutrient, does not require individual compliance, and potential to maintain nutrient stores more efficiently if consumed on a regular basis.<ref name="CMJ"/>

==Criticism==
Several organizations such as the WHO, FAO, Health Canada, and the Nestlé Research Center acknowledge that there are limitations to food fortification. Within the discussion of nutrient deficiencies the topic of nutrient toxicities can also be immediately questioned. Fortification of nutrients in foods may deliver toxic amounts of nutrients to an individual and also cause its associated side effects. As seen with the case of [[fluoride]] toxicity below, the result can be irreversible staining to the teeth. Although this may be a minor toxic effect to health, there are several that are more severe.<ref>Food Safety Network. Food Fortification. 2011 [cited 2011 Oct 30]. Available from: http://www.uoguelph.ca/foodsafetynetwork/food-fortification</ref>

The WHO states that limitations to food fortification may include: human rights issues indicating that consumers have the right to choose if they want fortified products or not, the potential for insufficient demand of the fortified product, increased production costs leading to increased retail costs, the potential that 
the fortified products will still not be a solution to nutrient deficiencies amongst low income populations who may not be able to afford the new product, and children who may not be able to consume adequate amounts thereof.<ref name="WHO-FAO_Guidelines"/>

Food safety worries led to legislation in Denmark in 2004 restricting foods fortified with extra vitamins or minerals. Products banned include: [[Rice Crispies]], [[Shreddies]], [[Horlicks]], [[Ovaltine]] and [[Marmite]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/8533896/Marmite-made-illegal-in-Denmark.html |title=Marmite made illegal in Denmark |work=The Telegraph |author=Bruno Waterfield |date=24 May 2011}}</ref>
<blockquote>Danes said [Kelloggs] Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies and Special K wanted to include "toxic" doses which, if eaten regularly, could damage children's livers and kidneys and harm fetuses in pregnant women.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/aug/12/foodanddrink |title=Denmark bans Kellogg's vitamins |work=The Guardian |author=James Meikle and Luke Harding |date=12 August 2004}}</ref></blockquote>
===Limited absorption===
One factor that limits the benefits of food fortification is that isolated nutrients added back in to a processed food that has had many of its nutrients removed, does not always result in the added nutrients being as bioavailable as they would be in the original, whole food.  An example is [[skim milk]] that has had the fat removed, and then had [[vitamin A]] and [[vitamin D]] added back.  Vitamins A and D are both fat soluble and not water soluble, so a person consuming skim milk in the absence of fats may not be able to absorb enough of these vitamins as one would be able to absorb from drinking whole milk.

Phytochemicals such as polyphenols can also impact nutrient absorption.
===Different forms of micronutrients===
There is a concern that micronutrients are legally defined in such a way that does not distinguish between different forms, and that fortified foods often have nutrients in a balance that would not occur naturally.   For example, in the U.S., food is fortified with folic acid, which is one of the many naturally-occurring forms of folate, and which only contributes a minor amount to the folates occurring in natural foods.<ref name="adavidsmith">[http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/85/1/3.full A. David Smith, "Folic acid fortification: the good, the bad, and the puzzle of vitamin", ''American Society for Clinical Nutrition'', Vol. 85, No. 1, 3-5. January 2007.]</ref>  In many cases, such as with folate, it is an open question of whether or not there are any benefits or risks to consuming folic acid in this form.

In many cases, the micronutrients added to foods in fortification are synthetic.

In some cases, certain forms of micronutrients can be actively toxic in a sufficiently high dose, even if other forms are safe at the same or much higher doses.  There are examples of such toxicity in both synthetic and naturally-occurring forms of vitamins.  [[Retinol]], the active form of Vitamin A, is toxic in a much lower dose than other forms, such as beta carotene.  [[Menadione]], a synthetic form of [[Vitamin K]], is also known to be toxic.<ref name=Higdon>{{cite web|last=Higdon|title=Vitamin K|publisher=Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University|date=February 2008|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminK/|accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref>

==Food supplements==
There are several main groups of food supplements:
*[[Vitamin]]s and co-vitamins
*[[Essential mineral]]s
*[[Essential fatty acid]]s
*[[Essential amino acid]]s
*[[Phytonutrient]]s
*[[Enzyme]]s

==Examples of fortified foods==
Many foods and beverages worldwide have been fortified, whether a voluntary action by the product developers or by law. Although some may view these additions as strategic marketing schemes to sell their product, there is a lot of work that must go into a product before simply fortifying it. In order to fortify a product, it must first be proven that the addition of this vitamin or mineral is beneficial to health, safe, and an effective method of delivery. The addition must also abide by all food and labeling regulations and support nutritional rationale. From a food developer's point of view, they also need to consider the costs associated with this new product and whether or not there will be a market to support the change.<ref>http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPNS%2FPNS49_01%2FS0029665190000106a.pdf&code=bff50d94f640323690aecae20ceafeb1{{Dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>

Examples of foods and beverages that have been fortified and shown to have positive health effects:

=== Iodized Salt ===
"[[Iodine deficiency]] disorder (IDD) is the single greatest cause of preventable mental retardation. Severe deficiencies cause [[cretinism]], stillbirth and miscarriage. But even mild deficiency can significantly affect the learning ability of populations........ Today over 1 billion people in the world suffer from iodine deficiency, and 38 million babies born every year are not protected from brain damage due to IDD."—Kul Gautam, Deputy Executive Director, UNICEF, October 2007<ref>Salt Institute. Iodized Salt. 2011 [cited 2011 Oct 30]. Available from: http://www.saltinstitute.org/Uses-benefits/Salt-in-Food/Essential-nutrient/Iodized-salt</ref>

[[Iodised salt]] has been used in the [[United States]] since before [[World War II]]. It was discovered in 1821 that [[goiters]] could be treated by the use of iodized salts. However, it was not until 1916 that the use of iodized salts could be tested in a research trial as a preventative measure against [[goiters]]. By 1924, it became readily available in the US.<ref>History of Iodized Salt. ICCID. 2011 [cited 2011 Oct 30] Available from: http://www.iccidd.org/pages/protecting-children/fortifying-salt/history-of-salt-iodization.php</ref> 

Currently in Canada and the US, the [[Recommended Dietary Allowances|RDA]] for iodine is as low as 90mcg/day for children (4–8 years) and as high as 290mcg/day for breast-feeding mothers.<ref name="LPI_iodine">Linus Pauling Institute Micronutrient Research for Optimum Health. Micronutrient Information Center. 2003 [cited 2011 Oct 30]. Available from: http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/iodine/</ref>

Diseases that are associated with an [[iodine deficiency]] include: [[mental retardation]], [[hypothyroidism]], and [[goiter]]. There is also a risk of various other growth and developmental abnormalities.<ref name="LPI_iodine"/>

=== Folic Acid ===
[[Folic acid]] (also known as folate) functions in reducing blood homosysteine levels, forming red blood cells, proper growth and division of cells, and preventing [[neural tube defects]] (NTDs).<ref>The Ohio State University Extension. Extension Fact Sheet. 2004 [cited 2011 Oct 30]. Available from: http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/5000/pdf/5553.pdf</ref>

In many industrialized countries, the addition of folic acid to flour has prevented a significant number of NTDs in infants. Two common types of NTDs, [[spina bifida]] and [[anencephaly]], affect approximately 2500-3000 infants born in the US annually. Research trials have shown the ability to reduce the incidence of NTDs by supplementing pregnant mothers with [[folic acid]] by 72%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Honein MA, Paulozzi LJ, Mathews TJ, Erickson JD, Wong LY |title=Impact of folic acid fortification of the US food supply on the occurrence of neural tube defects |journal=JAMA |volume=285 |issue=23 |pages=2981–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11410096 |url=http://jama.highwire.org/cgi/reprint/285/23/2981.pdf |doi=10.1001/jama.285.23.2981}}</ref>

The [[Recommended Dietary Allowances|RDA]] for [[folic acid]] ranges from as low as 150μg/day for children aged 1–3 years old, to 400μg/day for males and females over the age of 19, and 600μg/day during pregnancy.<ref>Office of Dietary Supplements National Institute of Health. Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Folate. [cited 2011 Oct 30] Available from:http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/folate</ref>

Diseases associated with folic acid deficiency include: [[megaloblastic anemia|megaloblastic]] or [[macrocytic anemia]], [[cardiovascular disease]], certain types of cancer, and NTDs in infants.<ref>Linus Pauling Institute Micronutrient Research for Optimum Health. Micronutrient Information Center. 2002 [cited 2011 Oct 30]. Available from: http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/fa/</ref>

=== Niacin ===
[[Niacin]] has been added to bread in the USA since 1938 (when voluntary addition started), a programme which substantially reduced the incidence of [[pellagra]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Park YK, Sempos CT, Barton CN, Vanderveen JE, Yetley EA |title=Effectiveness of food fortification in the United States: the case of [[pellagra]] |journal=American journal of public health |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=727–38 |year=2000 |pmid=10800421 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.90.5.727 |pmc=1446222}}</ref> As early as 1755, [[pellagra]] was recognized by doctors as being a niacin deficiency disease. Although not officially receiving its name of [[pellagra]] until 1771.<ref name="Prousky2001">Prousky, J., Millman, C.G.,  Kirkland, J.B. Pharmacologic Use of Niacin. Journal of Evidence-Based Complementary & Alternative Medicine. 2001; 16(2): 91-101.</ref> [[Pellagra]] was seen amongst poor families who used corn as their main dietary staple. Although corn itself does contain niacin, it is not a bioavailable form unless it undergoes [[Nixtamalization]] (treatment with alkali, traditional in Native American cultures) and therefore was not contributing to the overall intake of niacin.<ref name="LPI_niacin">Linus Pauling Institute Micronutrient Research for Optimum Health. Micronutrient Information Center. 2002 [cited 2011 Oct 30]. Available from: http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/niacin/</ref> Although [[pellagra]] can still be seen in developing countries, fortification of food with  niacin played a huge role in eliminating the prevalence of the disease.<ref name="Prousky2001"/>

The RDA for niacin is 2&nbsp;mg NE(niacin equivalents)/day ([[Adequate Intake|AI]]) for infants aged 0–6 months, 16&nbsp;mg NE/day for males, and 14&nbsp;mg NE/day for females who are over the age of 19.<ref name="LPI_niacin"/>

Diseases associated with niacin deficiency include: Pellagra which consisted of signs and symptoms called the 3D's-"Dermatitis, dementia, and diarrhea. Others may include vascular or gastrointestinal diseases.<ref name="Prousky2001"/>

Common diseases which present a high frequency of niacin deficiency: alcoholism, anorexia nervosa, HIV infection, gastrectomy, malabsorptive disorders, certain cancers and their associated treatments.<ref name="Prousky2001"/>

=== Vitamin D ===
Since [[Vitamin D]] is a [[Fat soluble vitamins|fat soluble vitamin]] it cannot be added to a wide variety of foods. Foods that it is commonly added to are margarine, vegetable oils and dairy products.<ref>FAO Agricultural and Consumer Protection. Food Fortification Technology. 1996 [cited 2011 Oct 30]. Available from:http://www.fao.org/docrep/W2840E/w2840e03.htm</ref> During the late 1800s, after the discovery of curing conditions of [[scurvy]] and [[beriberi]] had occurred, researchers were aiming to see if the disease, later known as [[rickets]], could also be cured by food. Their results showed that sunlight exposure and cod liver oil were the cure. It was not until the 1930s that [[vitamin D]] was actually linked to curing [[rickets]].<ref>Authors unknown. A dose of vitamin D history. Nature Structural Biology. 2002; 9(2):77.</ref> This discovery led to the fortification of common foods such as milk, margarine, and breakfast cereals. This took the astonishing statistics of approximately 80-90% of children showing varying degrees of bone deformations due to vitamin D deficiency to being a very rare condition.<ref name="Holick2010">Holick, M.F. The Vitamin D Deficiency Pandemic: a Forgotten Hormone Important for Health. Health Reviews. 2010; 32: 267-283.</ref>

Risk factors for vitamin D deficiencies include:
* In infants, being exclusively or primarily breast-fed
* Dark skin
* Living in cold climates and having little sun exposure
* Being elderly
* Covering all or almost all of one's skin while outdoors
* Liberal use of high-SPF sunscreens
* Fat malabsorption syndromes
* [[Inflammatory bowel diseases]]
* Obesity <ref name="LPI_vitaminD">Linus Pauling Institute Micronutrient Research for Optimum Health. Micronutrient Information Center. 2004 [cited 2011 Oct 30]. Available from: http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/</ref>

The current [[Recommended Dietary Allowances|RDA]] for infants aged 0–6 months is 25mcg's (1000 International Units (IU)/day and for adults over 19 years of age it is 100mcg's (4000IU)/day.<ref name="LPI_vitaminD"/>

Diseases associated with a vitamin D deficiency include [[rickets]], [[osteoporosis]], and certain types of cancer (breast, prostate, colon and ovaries). It has also been associated with increased risks for fractures, [[heart disease]], [[type 2 diabetes]], autoimmune and infectious diseases, [[asthma]] and other wheezing disorders, [[myocardial infarction]], [[hypertension]], [[congestive heart failure]], and [[peripheral vascular disease]].<ref name="Holick2010"/>

=== Fluoride ===
{{main|Water fluoridation}}
Although [[fluoride]] is not considered an essential mineral, it is seen as crucial in prevention of tooth decay and maintaining adequate dental health.<ref name="LPI_fluoride">Linus Pauling Institute Micronutrient Research for Optimum Health. Micronutrient Information Center. 2001 [cited 2011 Oct 30]. Available from: http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/fluoride/</ref> In the mid 1900s it was discovered that towns with a high level of [[fluoride]] in their water supply was causing the residents' teeth to have both brown spotting and a strange resistance to dental caries. This led to the fortification of water supplies with [[fluoride]] with safe amounts to retain the properties of resistance to dental caries but avoid the staining cause by [[Dental fluorosis|fluorosis]] (a condition caused by a fluoride toxicity).<ref>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. The Story of Fluoridation. 2011 [cited 2011 Oct 30]. Available from: http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/oralhealth/topics/fluoride/thestoryoffluoridation.htm</ref>

The [[Tolerable upper intake levels|tolerable upper intake level (UL)]] set for fluoride ranges from 0.7&nbsp;mg/day for infants aged 0–6 months and 10&nbsp;mg/day for adults over the age of 19. 

Conditions commonly associated with [[fluoride]] deficiency are dental caries and osteoporosis.<ref name="LPI_fluoride"/>

=== Others ===
Some other examples of fortified foods:
*[[Calcium]] is frequently added to fruit juices, carbonated beverages and rice.<ref>Linus Pauling Institute Micronutrient Research for Optimum Health. Micronutrient Information Center. 2003 [cited 2011 Oct 30]. Available from:http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/calcium/</ref>
*[[White rice]] is frequently enriched to replace lost nutrients during milling or adding extras in.<ref>USA Rice Federation. Brown and White Rice FAQ's. 2006 [cited 2011 Oct 30]. Available from: http://www.usarice.com/doclib/196/158/3403.pdf</ref>
*"[[Golden rice]]" is a variety of rice which has been [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] to produce [[beta carotene]].<ref>Dawe,D. Crop Case Study: GMO Golden Rice in Asia with Enhanced Vitamin A Benefits for Consumers. The Journal of Agrobiotechnology Management and Economics. 2007; 10(3): 154-160.</ref>
*Amylase rich flour is utilized for food making to increase dietary consumption.<ref>Hossain, M.I., Wahed, M.A., Ahmed, S. Increased food intake after the addition of amylase-rich flour to supplementary food for malnourished children in rural communities of Bangladesh. Food Nutr Bull. 2005; 26(4):323-9.</ref>

== Fortification for body building ==
Despite having some scientific basis, but with controversial ethics, is the science of using foods and food supplements to achieve a defined health goal. A common example of this use of food supplements is the extent to which body builders will use amino acid mixtures, vitamins and phytochemicals to enhance natural hormone production, increase muscle and reduce fat. The literature is not concrete on an appropriate method for use of fortification for body builders and therefore may not be recommended due to safety concerns.<ref>Chromiak, J.A., Antonio, J. Use of amino acids as growth hormone-releasing agents by athletes. Nutrition. 2002; 18(7-8): 657-661</ref>

== Fortification for medical treatment ==

There is interest in the use of food supplements in established medical conditions. This [[nutritional supplement]]ation using foods as medicine ([[nutraceutical]]s) has been effectively used in treating disorders affecting the immune system up to and including cancers.<ref>Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals. 2011 [cited 2011 Oct 30]. Available from: http://www4.agr.gc.ca/AAFC-AAC/display-afficher.do?id=1170856376710&lang=eng</ref> This goes beyond the definition of "food supplement", but should be included for the sake of completeness.
