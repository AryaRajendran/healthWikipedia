'''Neurodegeneration''' is the umbrella term for the progressive loss of structure or function of [[neurons]], including death of neurons. Many neurodegenerative diseases including [[Parkinson’s]], [[Alzheimer’s]], and [[Huntington’s]] occur as a result of neurodegenerative processes. As research progresses, many similarities appear which relate these diseases to one another on a sub-cellular level. Discovering these similarities offers hope for therapeutic advances that could ameliorate many diseases simultaneously. There are many parallels between different neurodegenerative disorders including atypical protein assemblies as well as induced cell death.<ref name="rubinsztein">{{cite journal

==Links between neurodegenerative disorders==

===Genetics===
Many neurodegenerative diseases are caused by genetic mutations, most of which are located in completely unrelated genes. In many of the different diseases, the mutated gene has a common feature: a repeat of the CAG nucleotide triplet. CAG encodes for the amino acid [[glutamine]]. A repeat of CAG results in a [[polyglutamine tract|polyglutamine (polyQ) tract]]. Diseases showing this are known as [[polyglutamine disease]]s.<ref name = thompson>{{cite journal

*'''Polyglutamine:''' A repeat in this causes dominant pathogenesis. Extra glutamine residues can acquire toxic properties through a variety of ways, including irregular protein folding and degradation pathways, altered subcellular localization, and abnormal interactions with other cellular proteins.<ref name = thompson /> PolyQ studies often use a variety of animal models because there is such a clearly defined trigger – repeat expansion. Extensive research has been done using models of worms (''C. elegans''), fruit flies (''Drosophila''), mice, and non-human primates. It is important to note that mammalian data is often needed for FDA approval of drugs, so a bulk of the research is done using mice. Using data from the other animals (C. elegans and Drosophila primarily) is often a precursor to finding the equivalent mammalian gene.<ref name = marsh /><ref name = orr>{{cite journal

For a complete list see the table under '''Polyglutamine (PolyQ) Diseases''' in the article [[Trinucleotide repeat disorder]]. While polyglutamine-repeat diseases encompass many different neurodegenerative disorders, there are many more it does not apply to. The genetics behind each disease are different and often unknown.

===Protein misfolding===
Several neurodegenerative diseases are classified as [[proteopathy|proteopathies]] as they are associated with the [[aggregation]] of [[protein folding|misfolded proteins]].
*'''[[alpha-synuclein]]:''' can aggregate to form insoluble fibrils in pathological conditions characterized by Lewy bodies, such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. Alpha-synuclein is the primary structural component of Lewy body fibrils. In addition, an alpha-synuclein fragment, known as the non-Abeta component (NAC), is found in amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease.
*'''tau:''' hyperphosphorylated [[tau protein]] is the main component of [[neurofibrillary tangles]] in Alzheimer's disease.
*'''[[beta amyloid]]:''' the major component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease.

===Intracellular mechanisms===

====Protein degradation pathways====
[[Parkinson’s]] disease and [[Huntington’s]] disease are both late-onset and associated with the accumulation of intracellular toxic proteins. Diseases caused by the aggregation of proteins are known as proteinopathies, and they are primarily caused by aggregates in the following structures:<ref name="rubinsztein"/>

* cytosol, e.g. [[Parkinson's]] & [[Huntington's]]
* nucleus, e.g. [[Spinocerebellar ataxia]] type 1 (SCA1)
* endoplasmic reticulum (ER), (as seen with neuroserpin mutations that cause familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies)
* extracellularly excreted proteins, amyloid-β in [[Alzheimer’s]] disease

There are two main avenues eukaryotic cells use to remove troublesome proteins or organelles: 

*'''ubiquitin–proteasome:''' protein [[ubiquitin]] along with enzymes is key for the degradation of many proteins that cause proteinopathies including polyQ expansions and alpha-synucleins. Research indicates proteasome enzymes may not be able to correctly cleave these irregular proteins which could possibly result in a more toxic species. This is the primary route cells use to degrade proteins.<ref name ="rubinsztein"/>
** Decreased proteasome activity is consistent with models in which intracellular protein aggregates form. It is still unknown whether or not these aggregates are a cause or a result of neurodegeneration.<ref name="rubinsztein"/>

*'''autophagy–lysosome pathways:''' a form of [[programmed cell death]] (PCD), this becomes the favorable route when a protein is aggregate-prone meaning it is a poor proteasome substrate. This can be split into two forms of autophagy: '''[[macroautophagy]]''' and '''chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)'''.<ref name="rubinsztein"/>
**'''macroautophagy''' is involved with nutrient recycling of macromolecules under conditions of starvation, certain apoptotic pathways, and if absent, leads to the formation of ubiquinated inclusions. Experiments in mice with neuronally confined macroautophagy-gene knockouts develop intraneuronal aggregates leading to neurodegeneration.<ref name ="rubinsztein"/>
**'''chaperone-mediated autophagy''' defects may also lead to neurodegeneration. Research has shown that mutant proteins bind to the CMA-pathway receptors on lysosomal membrane and in doing so block their own degradation as well as the degradation of other substrates.<ref name="rubinsztein"/>

====Membrane damage====
Damage to the membranes of organelles by monomeric or oligomeric proteins could also contribute to these diseases. Alpha-synuclein can damage membranes by inducing membrane curvature,<ref name=curvature>{{cite journal|last=Varkey|first=Jobin|coauthors=Isas JM, Mizuno N, Jensen MB, Bhatia VK, Jao CC, Petrlova J, Voss JC, Stamou DG, Steven AC, Langen R|title=Membrane curvature induction and tubulation are common features of synucleins and apolipoproteins|year=2010|pmid=20693280|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20693280|doi=10.1074/jbc.M110.139576|pmc=2952250|volume=285|issue=42|pages=32486–93}}</ref> and extensive tubulation and vesiculation were observed when these proteins were incubated with artificial phospholipid vesicles.<ref name=curvature/>

====Mitochondrial dysfunction====
The most common form of cell death in neurodegeneration is through the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This pathway controls the activation of caspase-9 by regulating the release of [[cytochrome c]] from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS). [[Reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) are normal byproducts of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity. ROS concentration is mediated by mitochondrial antioxidants such as manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and [[glutathione peroxidase]]. Over production of ROS ([[oxidative stress]]) is a central feature of all neurodegenerative disorders. In addition to the generation of ROS, mitochondria are also involved with life-sustaining functions including calcium homeostasis, PCD, [[mitochondrial fission]] and [[mitochondrial fusion|fusion]], lipid concentration of the mitochondrial membranes, and the mitochondrial permeability transition. Mitochondrial disease leading to neurodegeneration is likely, at least on some level, to involve all of these functions.<ref name = dimauro />

There is strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play a causal role in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis, including in four of the more well known diseases [[Alzheimer's]], [[Parkinson's]], [[Huntington's]], and [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]].<ref name = lin>{{cite journal

|bibcode = 2006Natur.443..787L }}</ref>

====Axonal transport====
Axonal swelling and spheroids have been observed in many different neurodegenerative diseases. This suggests that defective axons are not only present in diseased neurons, but also that they may cause certain pathological insult due to accumulation of organelles. Axonal transport can be disrupted by a variety of mechanisms including damage to: [[kinesin]] and [[cytoplasmic dynein]], [[microtubules]], cargoes, and [[mitochondria]].<ref name = devos>{{cite journal

}}</ref> There are, however, situations in which these mediated pathways are artificially stimulated due to injury or disease.<ref name = bredesen/>

====Apoptosis (type I)====
[[Apoptosis]] is a form of programmed cell death in multicellular organisms. It is one of the main types of [[programmed cell death]] (PCD) and involves a series of biochemical events leading to a characteristic cell morphology and death.

*'''Extrinsic apoptotic pathways:''' Occur when factors outside the cell activate cell surface death receptors (e.g. Fas) which result in the activation of [[caspases]]-8 or -10.<ref name = bredesen />

*'''Intrinsic apoptotic pathways:''' result from mitochondrial release of [[cytochrome c]] or endoplasmic reticulum malfunctions both of which lead to the activation of caspase-9. The [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[Golgi apparatus]] are other organelles that have damage sensors which can lead the cells down apoptotic pathways.<ref name = bredesen /><ref name = green>{{cite journal

[[Caspases]] (cysteine-aspartic acid proteases) cleave at very specific [[amino acid]] residues. There are two types of caspases: '''initiators''' and '''effectors'''. Initiator caspases cleave inactive forms of effector caspases. This activates the effectors which in turn cleave other proteins resulting in apoptotic initiation.<ref name = bredesen />

====Autophagic (type II)====
Autophagy is essentially a form of intracellular [[phagocytosis]] in which a cell actively consumes damaged organelles or misfolded proteins by encapsulating them into an autophagosome, which fuses with a lysosome to destroy the contents of the autophagosome. Many neurodegenerative diseases show unusual protein aggregates. This could potentially be a result of underlying autophagic defect common to multiple neurodegenerative diseases. It is important to note that this is a hypothesis, and more research must be done.<ref name = bredesen />

====Cytoplasmic (type III)====
The final and least understood PCD mechanism is through non-apoptotic processes. These fall under Type III, or cytoplasmic cell death. Many other forms of PCD are observed but not fully understood or accepted by the scientific community. For example, PCD might be caused by trophotoxicity, or hyperactivation of trophic factor receptors. In addition to this, other cytotoxins that induce PCD at low concentrations act to cause [[necrosis]], or aponecrosis – the combination of apoptosis and necrosis, when in higher concentrations. It is still unclear exactly what combination of apoptosis, non-apoptosis, and necrosis causes different kinds of aponecrosis.<ref name = bredesen />

===PCD and neurodegeneration===
Current research, often in transgenic animal models, implicates both apoptotic and non-apoptotic pathways in neurodegeneration. Different diseases may enter these pathways at different points, but once triggered can lead to interdependent pathways of cell death.<ref name = bredesen /> Generally, cell death in neurodegeneration is due to apoptosis and most commonly through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.<ref name = dimauro>{{cite journal

===Parkinson’s disease===
{{main|Parkinson's disease}}

Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and manifests as bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor and posture instability. The crude prevalence rate of PD has been reported to range from 15 per 100,000 to 12,500 per 100,000, and the incidence of PD from 15 per 100,000 to 328 per 100,000, with the disease being less common in Asian countries. Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. It results from the death of dopamine-generating cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain; the cause of cell-death is unknown. The following paragraph is an excerpt from the Pathophysiology section of the article [[Parkinson's disease]].

The mechanism by which the brain cells in Parkinson's are lost ''may'' consist of an abnormal accumulation of the protein [[alpha-synuclein]] bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. The [[alpha-synuclein]]-ubiquitin complex cannot be directed to the proteosome.  This [[protein]] accumulation forms proteinaceous cytoplasmic inclusions called [[Lewy bodies]]. The latest research on pathogenesis of disease has shown that the death of dopaminergic neurons by alpha-synuclein is due to a defect in the machinery that transports proteins between two major cellular organelles — the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. Certain proteins like Rab1 may reverse this defect caused by alpha-synuclein in animal models.<ref>"Parkinson's Disease Mechanism Discovered," [http://www.hhmi.org/news/lindquist20060622.html HHMI Research News] June 22, 2006.</ref>

Recent research suggests that impaired axonal transport of alpha-synuclein leads to its accumulation in the Lewy bodies. Experiments have revealed reduced transport rates of both wild-type and two familial Parkinson's disease-associated mutant alpha-synucleins through axons of cultured neurons.<ref name = devos /> Membrane damage by alpha-synuclein could be another Parkinson's disease mechanism.<ref name=curvature/>

The main known risk factor is age. Susceptibility genes including α-synuclein, leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK-2), and glucocerebrosidase (GBA) have shown that genetic predisposition is another important causal factor.

Mutant Huntingtin is an aggregate-prone protein. During the cells' natural clearance process, these proteins are retrogradely transported to the cell body for destruction by lysosomes. It is a possibility that these mutant protein aggregates damage the retrograde transport of important cargoes such as [[BDNF]] by damaging molecular motors as well as microtubules.<ref name = devos />

===Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)===
{{main|Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis}}

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS/Lou Gehrig’s Disease) is a disease in which motor neurons are selectively targeted for degeneration. In 1993, missense mutations in the gene encoding the antioxidant enzyme Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) were discovered in subsets of patients with familial ALS. This discovery led researchers to focus on unlocking the mechanisms for SOD1-mediated diseases. Unfortunately, the pathogenic mechanism underlying SOD1 mutant toxicity has yet to be resolved.

==Aging and neurodegeneration==
The greatest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases is aging. Mitochondrial DNA mutations as well as oxidative stress both contribute to aging.<ref name = lin /> Many of these diseases are late-onset, meaning there is some factor that changes as a person ages for each disease.<ref name="rubinsztein"/> One constant factor is that in each disease, neurons gradually lose function as the disease progresses with age.

==Therapeutics==
The process of neurodegeneration is not well understood so the diseases that stem from it have, as yet, no cures. In the search for effective treatments (as opposed to [[palliative care]]), investigators employ [[animal model]]s of disease to test potential therapeutic agents. Model organisms provide an inexpensive and relatively quick means to perform two main functions: target identification and target validation. Together, these help show the value of any specific therapeutic strategies and drugs when attempting to ameliorate disease severity. An example is the drug [[Dimebon]] (Medivation). This drug is in phase III clinical trials for use in Alzheimer’s disease, and also recently finished phase II clinical trials for use in Huntington’s disease.<ref name = marsh />

In another experiment using a rat model of Alzheimer's disease, it was demonstrated that systemic administration of hypothalamic proline-rich peptide (PRP)-1 offers neuroprotective effects and can prevent neurodegeneration in hippocampus [[amyloid-beta]] 25–35. This suggests that there could be therapeutic value to PRP-1.<ref name = galoyan>{{cite journal

Protein degradation offers therapeutic options both in preventing the synthesis and degradation of irregular proteins. There is also interest in upregulating autophagy to help clear protein aggregates implicated in neurodegeneration. Both of these options involve very complex pathways that we are only beginning to understand.<ref name="rubinsztein"/>

The goal of [[immunotherapy]] is to enhance aspects of the immune system. Both active and passive vaccinations  have been proposed for [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other conditions, however more research must be done to prove safety and efficacy in humans.<ref name = brody>{{cite journal
