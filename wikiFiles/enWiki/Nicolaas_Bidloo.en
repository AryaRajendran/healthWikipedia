'''Nicolaas Bidloo''' ([[Amsterdam]], ca. 1674 &ndash; March 23, 1735) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] physician who served as the personal physician of Tsar [[Peter I of Russia]] (Peter the Great). Bidloo was the director of the first hospital in Russia as well as the first medical school in Russia, and is considered one of the founders of Russian medicine.<ref name="vein">[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18257439 "Nicolaas Bidloo, the Dutch director of the first hospital in Russia; a 300-year anniversary", English-language abstract of A.A.

== Early years ==
Bidloo came from a [[Mennonites|Mennonite]] family of scientific repute. His father Lambert Bidloo (1638–1724) was an [[apothecary]] and wrote a treatise on botany <ref>[http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/B5396.html "Bidloo, Lambert (1638-1724)", Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia]</ref> and his uncle [[Govert Bidloo]] was the personal physician of King [[William III of England]]. Bidloo studied medicine at [[Leiden University]], where his uncle [[Govert Bidloo|Govert]] was a professor, and in January 1697 received a doctorate in the medical sciences. In 1701 he married Clasina Claes in Amsterdam.<ref name="boerhaave">J. Dankmeijer and Th. Roell, "Nicolaas Bidloo and the Institution of Medical Education in Moscow" in Gerrit Arie Lindeboom (ed.), ''Boerhaave and his time: Papers read at the International Symposium in Commemoration of the Tercentenary of Boerhaave's Birth, Leiden, 15–16 November 1968, Volume 1968'', Brill Archive, 1970, pp. 165-169</ref>

== Personal physician of Peter the Great ==

In 1702, Bidloo signed a contract with the Russian ambassador to serve as Tsar Peter the Great's personal physician for a period of six years, at an annual salary of 2500 Dutch guilders (an extraordinarily high pay for a physician at that time). He arrived in Russia with his family in June 1703. As the tsar's personal physician, Bidloo accompanied Peter the Great on his travels, but found himself with very little to do, as the tsar was in excellent health.<ref name="boerhaave"/>

As part of this efforts to modernize Russia, Peter the Great in 1707 ordered the establishment of the country's first hospital and appointed Bidloo as its director. Peter the Great granted Bidloo a piece of land on the [[Yauza River]], in the [[German Quarter]] on the outskirts of Moscow, to build the hospital as well as a house for himself and his family. As part of the hospital, Bidloo founded the first Russian medical school, where he gave instruction in anatomy and surgery to 50 students. The hospital and medical school also contained Russia's first anatomical theater. Here, Peter the Great regularly attended dissections.<ref>[http://ruysch.dpc.uba.uva.nl/cgi/t/text/text-idx?page=ruysch-relitaboe;c=ruysch;cc=ruysch "De anatomische preparaten van Frederick Ruysch", University of Amsterdam & Peter the Great Museum of Antropology and Ethnography, Russian Academy of Sciences]</ref> In 1710 Bidloo published the first Russian textbook on medical studies, a 1306-page manual of surgery entitled ''Instructio de chirurgia in theatro anatomico studiosis proposita a.d. 1710, januarii die 3''.<ref name="vein"/><ref name="boerhaave" /><ref>Jozien J.

The hospital burned down in 1721 but was restored and reopened in 1727.<ref>[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/lind006gesc01_01/lind006gesc01_01_0012.php G.A.

== Bidloo's gardens ==
Bidloo laid out extensive gardens on the hospital estate, including ponds, statues, a triumphal arch, and a botanical garden based on the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden|Hortus Botanicus]] in Leiden. He also advised Peter the Great on horticulture, gardens and fountains. The tsar visited Bidloo's garden frequently, even when Bidloo was not at home. Supposedly, Bidloo was also one of the original designers of the [[Summer Garden]] and [[Peterhof_Palace|Peterhof]] in St. Petersburg. In 1730 Bidloo published a manuscript on his private  garden, intended as a souvenir for his children. The manuscript included 19 drawings which Bidloo made of the gardens.<ref name="boerhaave" /><ref name="arcadia">[http://www.canaletto.nl/uploads/books/pdf/info_64.pdf Christian Bertram, "Noord-Hollands Arcadia: Ruim 400 Noord-Hollandse buitenplaatsen in tekeningen, prenten en kaarten uit de Provinciale Atlas Noord-Holland".
