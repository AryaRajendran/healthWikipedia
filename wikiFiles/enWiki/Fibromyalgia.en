Fibromyalgia has been recognized as a diagnosable disorder by the US [[National Institutes of Health]] and the [[American College of Rheumatology]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Fibromyalgia/default.asp |title=Q&A Fibromyalgia |publisher=Niams.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref><ref>http://www.rheumatology.org/practice/clinical/patients/diseases_and_conditions/fibromyalgia.pdf#search=%22fibromyalgia%22</ref> Fibromyalgia, a central nervous system disorder, is described as a "central sensitization syndrome" caused by neurobiological abnormalities which act to produce physiological pain and cognitive impairments as well as neuro-psychological symptomatology.<ref name="pmid21303476"/> Despite this there is controversy as to the cause and nature of fibromyalgia.  [[Rheumatologists]], [[neurologists]], and pain specialists tend to view fibromyalgia as a pathology of both biological and neurobiological origin. Psychiatrists often view fibromyalgia as being a type of [[affective disorder]], and specialists in [[psychosomatic medicine]] tend to view fibromyalgia as being [[somatoform disorder]]. The controversies involve both healthcare specialists as well as patients, who often object to fibromyalgia being described in purely [[somatic]] terms.<ref name="pmid19623319"/><ref name="Clauw-2011"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
The defining symptoms of fibromyalgia are chronic widespread pain, fatigue, and heightened pain in response to tactile pressure ([[allodynia]]). Other symptoms may include tingling of the skin, prolonged [[Spasm|muscle spasms]], [[Muscle weakness|weakness]] in the limbs, [[Neuropathy|nerve pain]], muscle twitching, [[palpitations]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/adamcontent/fibromyalgia |title=Information on Fibromyalgia |publisher=Healthline.com |date=2012-08-21 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> functional bowel disturbances,<ref name=p15361320/> and chronic [[Sleep disorder|sleep disturbances]].<ref name=pmid169541>{{cite journal |author=Moldofsky H, Scarisbrick P, England R, Smythe H |title=Musculoskeletal symptoms and non-REM sleep disturbance in patients with "fibrositis syndrome" and healthy subjects |journal=Psychosom Med |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=341–51 |year=1975 |pmid=169541 |doi= |url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=169541 |accessdate=21 May 2008}}</ref>

Many patients experience cognitive dysfunction<ref name=p17092441/> (known as "fibrofog"), which may be characterized by impaired concentration,<ref name=pmid17041327>{{cite journal |author=Leavitt F, Katz RS, Mills M, Heard AR |title=Cognitive and Dissociative Manifestations in Fibromyalgia |journal=J Clin Rheumatol. |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=77–84 |year=2002 |pmid=17041327|doi=10.1097/00124743-200204000-00003}}</ref> problems with [[Short-term memory|short]]<ref name=pmid17894922>{{cite journal |author=Buskila D, Cohen H |title=Comorbidity of fibromyalgia and psychiatric disorders |journal=Curr Pain Headache Rep |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=333–8 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17894922 |doi= 10.1007/s11916-007-0214-4|url= }}</ref><ref name=pmid17041327/> and [[long-term memory]], short-term memory consolidation,<ref name=pmid17894922/> impaired speed of performance,<ref name=pmid17894922/><ref name=pmid17041327/> inability to multi-task, cognitive overload,<ref name=pmid17894922/><ref name=pmid17041327/> and diminished [[attention span]]. Fibromyalgia is often associated with [[anxiety]] and [[Clinical depression|depressive]] symptoms.<ref name=pmid17894922/>

Other symptoms often attributed to fibromyalgia that may possibly be due to a [[comorbidity|comorbid]] disorder include [[myofascial pain syndrome]], also referred to as chronic myofascial pain, diffuse non-dermatomal [[paresthesia]]s, functional bowel disturbances and [[irritable bowel syndrome]], [[Urinary system|genitourinary]] symptoms and [[interstitial cystitis]], [[Dermatology|dermatological]] disorders, headaches, [[Myoclonus|myoclonic twitches]], and symptomatic [[hypoglycemia]]. Although fibromyalgia is classified based on the presence of chronic widespread pain, pain may also be localized in areas such as the [[shoulder]]s, [[neck]], low [[back]], [[hip]]s, or other areas. Many sufferers also experience varying degrees of myofascial pain and have high rates of comorbid [[temporomandibular joint disorder]]. 20–30% of patients with [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] may also have fibromyalgia.<ref name="PMID 17602995">{{cite journal

==Cause==
The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown. However, several hypotheses have been developed including "central sensitization". This theory proposes that fibromyalgia patients have a lower threshold for pain because of increased reactivity of pain-sensitive nerve cells in the spinal cord or brain.<ref name="pmid21303476" /> Neuropathic pain and major depressive disorder often co-occur with fibromyalgia - the reason for this comorbidity appears to be due to shared genetic abnormalities, which leads to impairments in [[monoaminergic]], [[glutamatergic]], [[neurotrophic]], [[opioid]] and [[proinflammatory cytokine]] signaling. In these vulnerable individuals psychological stress or illness can cause abnormalities in inflammatory and stress pathways which regulate mood and pain. Eventually a sensitisation and kindling effect occurs in certain [[neurones]] leading to the establishment of fibromyalgia and sometimes a mood disorder.<ref name="Maletic-2009">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Maletic | first1 = V. | last2 = Raison | first2 = CL. | title = Neurobiology of depression, fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain. | journal = Front Biosci | volume = 14 | issue =  | pages = 5291-338 | month =  | year = 2009 | doi =  | PMID = 19482616 }}</ref> The evidence suggests that the pain in fibromyalgia results primarily from pain processing pathways functioning abnormally. In simple terms it can be described as the volume of the neurones being set too high and this hyper-excitability of pain processing pathways and under-activity of inhibitory pain pathways in the brain results in the affected individual experiencing pain. Some of the neurochemical abnormalities that occur in fibromyalgia also regulate mood, sleep and energy, thus explaining why mood, sleep and fatigue problems are commonly co-morbid with fibromyalgia.<ref name="Clauw-2011"/>

===Genetics===
There is evidence that genetic factors may play a role in the development of fibromyalgia. For example, there is a high aggregation of fibromyalgia in families.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stormorken H |coauthors=Brosstad F |authorlink=Helge Stormorken |title=Fibromyalgia: family clustering and sensory urgency with early onset indicate genetic predisposition and thus a "true" disease |journal=Scand J Rheumatol. |volume=21 |issue=4 |page=207 |year=1992 |pmid=1529291 |doi=10.3109/03009749209099225}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Arnold LM |title=Family study of fibromyalgia |journal=Arthritis Rheum. |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=944–52 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15022338 |doi=10.1002/art.20042 |author-separator=, |author2=Hudson JI |author3=Hess EV |display-authors=3 |last4=Ware |first4=Avis E. |last5=Fritz |first5=Deborah A. |last6=Auchenbach |first6=Megan B. |last7=Starck |first7=Linsey O. |last8=Keck |first8=Paul E.}}</ref> Using self-report of chronic widespread pain (CWP) as a surrogate marker for fibromyalgia, the [http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?l=en&d=9610 Swedish Twin Registry] reports:<ref name="PMID16646040">{{cite journal |author=Kato K, Sullivan P, Evengård B, Pedersen N |title=Importance of genetic influences on chronic widespread pain |journal=Arthritis Rheum. |volume=54 |issue=5 |pages=1682–6 |year=2006 | doi=10.1002/art.21798 |pmid=16646040}}</ref><ref name="PMID16908799">{{cite journal |author=Kato K, Sullivan P, Evengård B, Pedersen N |title=Chronic widespread pain and its comorbidities: a population-based study |journal=Arch.

Two studies that employed single-voxel [[magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (1H-MRS) reported metabolic abnormalities within the hippocampal complex in patients with fibromyalgia.

Some authors have proposed that, because exposure to stressful conditions can alter the function of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis]], the development of fibromyalgia may stem from stress-induced disruption of the HPA axis.<ref>{{cite journal|author=McBeth J, Chiu YH, Silman AJ, Ray D, Morriss R, Dickens C, Gupta A, Macfarlane GJ.|title=Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis function and the relationship with chronic widespread pain and its antecedents|journal=Arthritis Res Ther. |year=2005| volume=7|issue=5|pages=R992–R1000|pmid=16207340|doi=10.1186/ar1772|pmc=1257426}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
There is no single test that can fully diagnose fibromyalgia and there is debate over what should be considered essential diagnostic criteria and whether an objective diagnosis is possible. In most cases, patients with fibromyalgia symptoms may also have laboratory test results that appear normal and many of their symptoms may mimic those of other rheumatic conditions such as arthritis or osteoporosis. In general, most doctors diagnose patients with a process called differential diagnosis, which means that doctors consider all of the possible things that might be wrong with the patient based on the patient's symptoms, gender, age, geographic location, medical history and other factors. They then narrow down the diagnosis to the most likely one. The most widely accepted set of classification criteria for research purposes was elaborated in 1990 by the Multicenter Criteria Committee of the [[American College of Rheumatology]]. These criteria, which are known informally as "the ACR 1990", define fibromyalgia according to the presence of the following criteria:
* A history of widespread pain lasting more than three months—affecting all four quadrants of the body, i.e., both sides, and above and below the waist.
* Tender points—there are 18 designated possible tender points (although a person with the disorder may feel pain in other areas as well). The patient no longer must feel pain at 11 or more of these points for fibromyalgia to be considered.<ref>{{cite web |author=American College of Rheumatology|title=FAST FACTSa&nbsp; |url=http://www.rheumatology.org/practice/clinical/patients/diseases_and_conditions/fibromyalgia.asp}}</ref>
<!-- The eleven of eighteen notation for diagnosis as that was only a criteria to participate in a study and it has somehow become a myth. Even the link referenced above does not state that as I did a search for 11 and eleven. As a matter of fact, I just found this on the following link. This is my first edit, so I am not sure if I did everythinh correctly. http://www.rheumatology.org/practice/clinical/patients/diseases_and_conditions/fibromyalgia.asp "Doctors diagnose fibromyalgia based on all the patient's relevant symptoms (what you feel), no longer just on the number of tender points." -->

The ACR criteria for classification of patients were originally established as inclusion criteria for research purposes and were not intended for clinical diagnosis but have now become the ''de facto'' diagnostic criteria in the clinical setting. It should be noted that the number of tender points that may be active at any one time may vary with time and circumstance. A controversial study done by a legal team looking to prove their client's disability based primarily on tender points and their widespread presence in non-litigious communities prompted the lead author of the ACR criteria to now question the useful validity of tender points in diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wolfe F |title=Stop using the American College of Rheumatology criteria in the clinic |journal=J. Rheumatol. |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=1671–2 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12913920 |doi= |url= http://www.jrheum.com/subscribers/03/08/1671.html}}</ref> Use of control points has been used to cast doubt on whether a person has fibromyalgia, and to claim the person is malingering, however, no research has been done for the use of control points to diagnose fibromyalgia and such diagnostic tests have been advised against and that patients complaining of pain all over should still have fibromyalgia considered as a diagnosis.<ref name="pmid19623319"/> Since the ACR criteria were originally published, research with [[dolorimeter|mechanical devices that exert defined pressure]] indicate that diagnosis of fibromyalgia cannot be done objectively by machine and require a physician's subjective estimate of how much pressure should be exerted.{{fact|date=March 2013}}

Fibromyalgia is widely under-diagnosed with up to 75 percent of people suffering with fibromyalgia not being diagnosed.<ref name="Clauw-2011"/>

==Management==
As with many other [[Medically unexplained physical symptoms|medically unexplained syndromes]], there is no universally accepted treatment or cure for fibromyalgia, and treatment typically consists of symptom management. Developments in the understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder have led to improvements in treatment, which include prescription medication, behavioral intervention and exercise. Indeed, integrated treatment plans that incorporate medication, patient education, aerobic exercise and cognitive-behavioral therapy have been shown to be effective in alleviating pain and other fibromyalgia-related symptoms.<ref name=Goldenberg2008>{{cite journal |author=Goldenberg DL |title=Multidisciplinary modalities in the treatment of fibromyalgia |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=30–4 |year=2008 |pmid=18537461 }}</ref>

===Psychological therapies===
[[Cognitive behavioural therapy]] (CBT) and related psychological/behavioral therapies are treatments which have been shown to be have a small to moderate effect in reducing symptoms of fibromyalgia in randomized controlled trials.<ref name="pmid20727679">{{cite journal |author=Glombiewski JA, Sawyer AT, Gutermann J, Koenig K, Rief W, Hofmann SG |title=Psychological treatments for fibromyalgia: a meta-analysis |journal=Pain |volume=151 |issue=2 |pages=280–95 |year=2010 |month=November |pmid=20727679 |doi=10.1016/j.pain.2010.06.011 |url=}}</ref> The greatest benefit occurs when CBT is used along with exercise.<ref name=Goldenberg2008/><ref name=Williams>{{cite journal | last=Williams| first=DA | title=Psychological and behavioural therapies in fibromyalgia and related syndromes | journal= Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol. | volume=17 | issue=4 | pages=649–65 |month=August| year=2003 | pmid=12849717 | doi=10.1016/S1521-6942(03)00034-2 }}</ref>

The [[Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany]] makes no recommendation either for or against the use of weak [[opioid]]s because of the limited amount of scientific research addressing their use in the treatment of FM. They strongly advise against using strong opioids.<ref name=German/> The [[European League Against Rheumatism]] recommends the weak opioid [[tramadol]] but not strong opioids.<ref name=EULAR/> The [[Canadian Pain Society]] says that opioids, starting with a weak opioid like tramadol, can be tried but only for patients with moderate to severe pain that is not well-controlled by non-opioid pain-killers. They discourage the use of strong opioids, and only recommend using them while they continue to provide improved pain and functioning. Healthcare providers must monitor patients on opioids for ongoing effectiveness, side effects and possible unwanted drug behaviours.<ref name=Canadian/> 

The combination of tramadol and [[paracetemol]] has demonstrated efficacy, safety and tolerability (for up to two years in the management of other pain conditions) without the development of tolerance. It is as effective as a combination of [[codeine]] (another mild opioid) and paracetamol but produces less sleepiness and constipation.<ref name = Schug_2006>{{vcite journal | author = Schug SA | year = 2006 | title = Combination analgesia in 2005&nbsp;– a rational approach: focus on paracetamol-tramadol | journal = Clinical rheumatology | volume = 25 | issue = Supplement}} PMID 16741784</ref>

A large study of US fibromyalgia patients found that between 2005 and 2007 37.4% were prescribed short-acting opioids and 8.3% were prescribed long-acting opioids,<ref name=Ngian>{{cite journal |author=Ngian GS, Guymer EK, Littlejohn GO |title=The use of opioids in fibromyalgia |journal=Int J Rheum Dis |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=6–11 |year=2011 |month=February |pmid=21303476 |doi=10.1111/j.1756-185X.2010.01567.x |url=}}</ref> with around 10% of those prescribed short-acting opioids using tramadol;<ref name=Berger>Berger A.

====Others====
The [[narcolepsy]] medication [[sodium oxybate]] has been studied in those with fibromyalgia, with moderate improvement in sleep, fatigue and pain symptoms.  However, this medication was not approved by the FDA for the indication for use in fibromyalgia patients due to the concern for [[Substance abuse|abuse]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Staud R |title=Sodium oxybate for the treatment of fibromyalgia |journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=12 |issue=11 |pages=1789–98 |year=2011 |month=August |pmid=21679091 |doi=10.1517/14656566.2011.589836 |url=}}</ref>

The muscle relaxants [[cyclobenzaprine]] and [[tizanidine]] are sometimes used [[Off-label use|off-label]] to treat fibromyalgia.<ref>{{cite journal|author=See S, Ginzburg R.|title=Am Fam Physician. 2008 Aug 1;78(3):365-70|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Tizanidine%20and%20fibromyalgia}}</ref><ref name =MicroMedex>{{cite web| title = Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride| work = MicroMedex|date=5 Feb 2010| accessdate =16 Feb 2010 |format = subscription required| url =http://www.thomsonhc.com/hcs/librarian/ND_T/HCS/ND_PR/Main/CS/367361/DUPLICATIONSHIELDSYNC/A4E03B/ND_PG/PRIH/ND_B/HCS/SBK/1/ND_P/Main/PFActionId/hcs.common.RetrieveDocumentCommon/DocId/151425/ContentSetId/100/SearchTerm/flexeril/SearchOption/BeginWith}}</ref>A small clinical trial of very low doses of cyclobenzaprine taken at bedtime demonstrated improved musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, tenderness and depression in FM patients.<ref name = Moldofsky>{{Cite journal| journal = Journal of Rheumatology|date= December 2011

[[Dopamine agonists]] (e.g. [[pramipexole]] (Mirapex) and [[ropinirole]] (ReQuip)) resulted in some improvement in a minority of patients,<ref name=pmid16052595/> but numerous side effects, including the onset of impulse control disorders like compulsive gambling and shopping, have led to concern about this approach.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Holman AJ|title=Impulse control disorder behaviors associated with pramipexole used to treat fibromyalgia |journal=J Gambl Stud|volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=425–31 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19241148 |doi=10.1007/s10899-009-9123-2}}</ref>

Evidence exists that fibromyalgia is a neuro-immuno-endocrine disorder. Elevations in [[substance P]], [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]] and [[Interleukin 8|IL-8]] as well as [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] have been found in the [[cerebral spinal fluid]] of fibromyalgia suffering individuals. Increased numbers of [[mast cell]] numbers have been found in skin biopsies of some individuals with fibromyalgia. [[Quercetin]], a [[nutraceutical|pharmacologically active natural product]] which possesses anti-inflammatory in addition to mast cell inhibiting properties may be a useful treatment.<ref name="pmid16569342">{{cite journal |author=Lucas HJ, Brauch CM, Settas L, Theoharides TC |title=Fibromyalgia—new concepts of pathogenesis and treatment |journal=Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=5–10 |year=2006 |pmid=16569342 }}</ref>

===Exercise===
Exercise improves fitness and sleep and may reduce pain and fatigue in some people with fibromyalgia.<ref name=pmid12137713>{{cite journal |author=Busch A, Schachter CL, Peloso PM, Bombardier C |title=Exercise for treating fibromyalgia syndrome |journal=[[Cochrane database of systematic reviews]] (Online) |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD003786 |year=2002 |pmid=12137713|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003786 |editor1-last=Busch |editor1-first=Angela}}</ref><ref name=pmid14770100>{{cite journal |author=Gowans SE, deHueck A |title=Effectiveness of exercise in management of fibromyalgia |journal=[[Current opinion in rheumatology]] |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=138–42 |year=2004 |pmid=14770100|doi=10.1097/00002281-200403000-00012}}</ref> In particular, there is strong evidence that cardiovascular exercise is effective for some patients.<ref name="Goldenberg2004"/> Long-term aquatic-based exercise has been proven beneficial as it combines cardiovascular exercise with resistance training.<ref name="Mannerkorpi">{{cite journal |author=Mannerkorpi, K., Nyberg, B., Ahlmén M., & Ekdahl C. |title=Pool exercise combined with an education program for patients with fibromyalgia syndrome: a prospective, randomized study |journal=Journal of Rheumatology |volume=27 |pages=2473–2481 |year=2000 |pmid=11036846 |issue=10 }}</ref> However, due to the cold sensitivities of people with fibromyalgia syndrome, [[aquatic therapy]] must take place in a warm pool. Not only that, but the air temperature outside of the pool must also be heated to prevent fibromyalgia patients from getting chills and aches when out of the water. This involves a specialised pool facility, which makes this therapy more expensive and less accessible than regular swimming exercise.

==Prognosis==
Although in itself neither degenerative nor fatal, the chronic pain of fibromyalgia is pervasive and persistent. Most fibromyalgia patients report that their symptoms do not improve over time. An evaluation of 332 consecutive new fibromyalgia patients found that disease-related factors such as pain and psychological factors such as work status, helplessness, education, and coping ability had an independent and significant relationship to FM symptom severity and function.<ref>{{cite journal | title=A model to assess severity and impact of fibromyalgia | journal=J Rheumatol. | volume=22| issue=12 | pages=2313–8 |month=December| year=1995 | pmid=8835568 | author=Goldenberg DL, Mossey CJ, Schmid CH. }}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Fibromyalgia is seen in about 2% of the general population<ref name=Chakrabarty>{{cite journal | last=Chakrabarty | first=S | coauthors=Zoorob R | title=Fibromyalgia | journal=[[American Family Physician]] | volume=76 | issue=2 | pages=247–254 |month=July | year=2007 | url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20070715/247.html | pmid=17695569 | accessdate=6 January 2008 }}</ref> and affects more females than males, with a ratio of 9:1 by ACR criteria.<ref>{{eMedicine|med|790|Fibromyalgia}}</ref> It is most commonly diagnosed in individuals between the ages of 20 and 50, though onset can occur in childhood.

==History==
Chronic widespread pain had already been described in the literature in the 19th century but the term fibromyalgia was not used until 1976 when Dr Hench used it to describe these symptoms.<ref name="pmid19623319"/> Many names, including "muscular rheumatism", "fibrositis", "psychogenic rheumatism", and "[[neurasthenia]]" were applied historically to symptoms resembling those of fibromyalgia.<ref>{{cite web |author=Health Information Team |title=Fibromyalgia |url=http://hcd2.bupa.co.uk/fact_sheets/mosby_factsheets/fibromyalgia.html |month=February | year=2004 |publisher=BUPA insurance}}</ref> The term ''fibromyalgia'' was coined by researcher Mohammed Yunus as a synonym for fibrositis and was first used in a scientific publication in 1981.<ref>{{Cite pmid|6944796}}</ref> Fibromyalgia is from the [[Latin]] ''fibra'' (fiber)<ref>{{cite web | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fibro- | title = Fibro- | publisher = Dictionary.com | accessdate =21 May 2008 }}</ref> and the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''myo'' (muscle)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/94/M0509400.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090412005428/http://www.bartleby.com/61/94/M0509400.html |archivedate=2009-04-12 |title=Meaning of myo |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-04-12 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> and ''algos'' (pain).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/59/A0195900.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090412005958/http://www.bartleby.com/61/59/A0195900.html |archivedate=2009-04-12 |title=Meaning of algos |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-04-12 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref>

===Economics===
Patients with fibromyalgia have higher health care costs and utilization. A study of almost 20,000 [[Humana]] members enrolled in [[Medicare Advantage]] and commercial plans compared costs and medical utilizations and found that persons with fibromyalgia used twice as much pain-related medication as those without fibromyalgia. Furthermore, the use of medications and medical necessities increased markedly across many measures once diagnosis was made.<ref>{{cite journal | author = |year = 2010 | title = High health care utilization and costs in patients with fibromyalgia | url =http://dbt.consultantlive.com/display/article/1145628/1582715 | journal = Drug Benefit Trends | volume = 22 | issue = 4|page = 111 }}</ref>
===Controversies===
Being a disorder defined relatively recently and still not completely understood, fibromyalgia continues to be a diagnosis that sometimes is disputed. Some members of the medical community do not consider fibromyalgia a disease because of a lack of abnormalities on physical examination and the absence of objective diagnostic tests.<ref name=FMWars>{{cite journal |doi=10.3899/jrheum.081180 |author=Wolfe F |title=Fibromyalgia wars |journal=J Rheumatol. |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=671–8 |year=2009 |pmid=19342721}}</ref><ref name=p7880118>{{cite journal |author=Goldenberg DL |title=Fibromyalgia: why such controversy? |journal=Ann.

[[Rheumatologists]], [[neurologists]], and pain specialists tend to view fibromyalgia as a pathology due to dysfunction of muscles, connective tissue as well as being due to functional abnormalities in the central nervous system. On the other hand, psychiatrists often view fibromyalgia as being a type of [[affective disorder]] whereas specialists in psychosomatic medicine tend to view fibromyalgia as being [[somatoform disorder]]. However, there is extensive research evidence to support the view that the central symptom of fibromyalgia, namely pain, has a [[neurogenic]] origin. The controversies don't just involve healthcare specialists but also patients who often object to fibromyalgia being described in purely somatic terms.<ref name="pmid19623319"/><ref name="Clauw-2011"/>

The validity of fibromyalgia as a unique clinical entity is a matter of contention because "no discrete boundary separates syndromes such as FMS, chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, or chronic muscular headaches."<ref name="Goldenberg2004">{{cite pmid|15547167}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|11346313}}</ref> Because of this considerable symptomatic overlap, some researchers have proposed that fibromyalgia and other syndromes with overlapping symptoms be classified as functional somatic syndromes for some purposes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kanaan RA, Lepine JP, Wessely SC |title=The association or otherwise of the functional somatic syndromes |journal=[[Psychosom Med]] |volume=69 |issue=9 |pages=855–9 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18040094 |pmc=2575798 |doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e31815b001a }}</ref>
