'''Christiana Care Health System''' is a network of private, non-profit hospitals providing health care services to all of [[Delaware]] and portions of seven counties bordering the state in Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey. The system includes two hospitals in Delaware, Wilmington Hospital and Christiana Hospital, as well as the Eugene du Pont Preventive Medicine & Rehabilitation Center, the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center, the Center for Heart & Vascular Health, Visiting Nurse Association and a wide range of outpatient and satellite services. It is headquartered in [[Wilmington, Delaware]].

The system's history dates to 1890, when '''Delaware Hospital''' was first opened in Wilmington.  It was expanded throughout the subsequent decades.  In 1965, it merged with Memorial Hospital and Wilmington General Hospital to form '''Wilmington Medical Center''', with each of the three facilities being known as a "division", thus Delaware Hospital became known as the '''Delaware Division of the Wilmington Medical Center'''.  Later it was decided to close the other two hospitals and replace them with a new one, '''Christiana Hospital'''.  In 1985, the Delaware Division was renamed '''Wilmington Hospital'''.

In 2007, Christiana Care saw 457,348 outpatient visits, 55,512 admissions and 7,100 childbirths.<ref name="christianacare.org">[http://issuu.com/christianacare/docs/factsandfigures/24 2008 Christiana Care Facts & Figures]</ref> Christiana Care provided $35.7 million in charity care in 2007.<ref name="christianacare.org"/> With more than 10,000 employees, it is one of the largest private employers in Delaware and among the top 10 in the greater Philadelphia region.<ref>[http://www.philly.com/philly/business/top100/21568744.html 2008 100 Top Non-Governmental Employers]</ref>
