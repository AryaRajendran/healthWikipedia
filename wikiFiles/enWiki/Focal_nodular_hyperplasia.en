'''Focal nodular hyperplasia''' (FNH) is a benign [[tumour]] of the [[liver]] ([[hepatic tumour]]), which is the second most prevalent tumour of the liver (the first is [[hepatic]] [[hemangioma]]). It is usually asymptomatic, rarely grows or bleeds, and has no malignant potential. This tumour was once often resected because it was difficult to distinguish from [[adenoma#Liver|hepatic adenoma]], but with modern multiphase imaging is usually now diagnosed by strict imaging criteria and not resected.

Focal nodular hyperplasia's most recognizable gross feature is a central stellate scar seen in 60–70% of cases.  Microscopically, a lobular proliferation of bland-appearing hepatocytes with a bile ductular proliferation and malformed vessels within the fibrous scar is the most common pattern.  Other patterns include telangiectatic, hyperplastic-adenomatous, and lesions with focal large-cell dysplasia.<ref name=Nguyen>{{cite journal |author=Nguyen BN, Flejou JF, Terris B, Belghiti J, Degott C |title=Focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver: a comprehensive pathologic study of 305 lesions and recognition of new histologic forms |journal=Am.
