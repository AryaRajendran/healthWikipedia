'''D-dimer''' is a [[fibrin degradation product]] (or FDP), a small protein fragment present in the blood after a [[thrombus|blood clot]] is degraded by [[fibrinolysis]]. It is so named because it contains two crosslinked D fragments of the fibrin protein.<ref name=Adam>{{cite journal |author=Adam SS, Key NS, Greenberg CS |title=D-dimer antigen: current concepts and future prospects |journal=Blood |volume=113 |issue=13 |pages=2878–2887 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19008457 |doi=10.1182/blood-2008-06-165845 |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/113/13/2878}}</ref>

D-dimer concentration may be determined by a [[blood test]] to help diagnose [[thrombosis]]. Since its introduction in the 1990s, it has become an important test performed in patients suspected of thrombotic disorders. While a negative result practically rules out thrombosis, a positive result can indicate thrombosis but does not rule out other potential causes. Its main use, therefore, is to exclude thromboembolic disease where the probability is low. In addition, it is used in the diagnosis of the blood disorder [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]].<ref name=Adam/>

==Principles==
[[Image:D-dimer.png|right|framed|Principles of D-dimer testing]]
[[Coagulation]], the formation of a blood clot or [[thrombus]], occurs when the proteins of the "[[coagulation cascade]]" are activated, either by contact with damaged blood vessel wall (intrinsic pathway) or by activation of [[factor VII]] by [[tissue factor|tissue activating factors]]. Both pathways lead to the generation of [[thrombin]], an enzyme that turns the soluble blood protein [[fibrin]]ogen into fibrin, which aggregates into proteofibrils. Another thrombin-generated enzyme, [[factor XIII]], then crosslinks the fibrin proteofibrils at the D fragment site, leading to the formation of an insoluble gel which serves as a scaffold for blood clot formation.<ref name=Adam/>

The circulating enzyme [[plasmin]], the main enzyme of [[fibrinolysis]], cleaves the fibrin gel in a number of places. The resultant fragments, "high molecular weight polymers", are digested several times more by plasmin to lead to intermediate and then to small polymers ([[fibrin degradation product]]s or FDPs). The cross-link between two D fragments remains intact, however, and these are exposed on the surface when the fibrin fragments are sufficiently digested. The typical D-dimer containing fragment contains two D domains and one E domain of the original fibrinogen molecule.<ref name=Adam/>

D-dimers are not normally present in human blood plasma, except when the coagulation system has been activated, for instance because of the presence of [[thrombosis]] or [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]]. The D-dimer assay depends on the binding of a [[monoclonal antibody]] to a particular [[epitope]] on the D-dimer fragment. Several detection kits are commercially available; all of them rely on a different monoclonal antibody against D-dimer. For some of these, the area of the D-dimer to which the antibody binds is known. The binding of the antibody is then measured quantitatively by one of various laboratory methods.<ref name=Adam/>

==Indications==
D-dimer testing is of clinical use when there is a suspicion of [[deep venous thrombosis]] (DVT), [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE) or [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC).<ref name=gpnotebook>[http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=26869806 General Practice Notebook > D-dimer] Retrieved September 2011</ref> It is under investigation in the diagnosis of [[aortic dissection]].<ref>{{cite pmid|20717014}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|21029872}}</ref>

For DVT and PE, there are possible various scoring systems that are used to determine the ''a priori'' clinical probability of these diseases; the best-known were introduced by Wells ''et al.'' (2003).
* For a very high score, or pretest probability, a D-dimer will make little difference and [[anticoagulant]] therapy will be initiated regardless of test results, and additional testing for DVT or pulmonary embolism may be performed.
* For a moderate or low score, or pretest probability:<ref name="pmid14507948">{{cite journal |author=Wells PS |title=Evaluation of D-dimer in the diagnosis of suspected deep-vein thrombosis |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=349 |issue=13 |pages=1227–1235 |year=2003 |pmid=14507948 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa023153|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/349/13/1227 |author-separator=, |author2=Anderson DR |author3=Rodger M |display-authors=3 |last4=Forgie |first4=Melissa |last5=Kearon |first5=Clive |last6=Dreyer |first6=Jonathan |last7=Kovacs |first7=George |last8=Mitchell |first8=Michael |last9=Lewandowski |first9=Bernard}}</ref>
** A negative D-dimer test will virtually rule out thromboembolism: the degree to which the D-dimer reduces the probability of thrombotic disease is dependent on the test properties of the specific test used in the clinical setting: most available D-dimer tests with a negative result will reduce the probability of thromboembolic disease to less than 1% if the pretest probability is less than 15-20%
** If the D-dimer reads high, then further testing ([[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] of the leg veins or lung [[scintigraphy]] or [[CTPA|CT scanning]]) is required to confirm the presence of [[thrombus]].  [[Anticoagulant]] therapy may be started at this point or withheld until further tests confirm the diagnosis, depending on the clinical situation.

In some hospitals, they are measured by laboratories after a form is completed showing the probability score and only if the probability score is low or intermediate. This reduces the need for unnecessary tests in those who are high-probability.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rathbun |first=SW |coauthors=TL Whitsett, SK Vesely, GE Raskob |year=2004 |title=Clinical utility of D-dimer in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and nondiagnostic lung scans or negative CT findings |journal=Chest |issue=  3|pages=851–855 |doi=10.1378/chest.125.3.851 |volume=125 |pmid=15006941 |pmc=1215466}}</ref> Performing the D-dimer test first can avoid a significant proportion of imaging tests and is less invasive.

==Test properties==
Various kits have a 93-95% sensitivity and about 50% specificity in the diagnosis of thrombotic disease.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12928229 | volume=49 | issue=9 | title=Comparison of diagnostic accuracies in outpatients and hospitalized patients of D-dimer testing for the evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism | year=2003 | month=September | pages=1483–1490 | author=Schrecengost JE | doi=10.1373/49.9.1483 | author-separator = , | author2 = LeGallo RD | author3 = Boyd JC | display-authors = 3 | journal = Clinical Chemistry | last4 = Moons | first4 = KG | last5 = Gonias | first5 = SL | last6 = Rose Jr | first6 = CE | last7 = Bruns | first7 = DE}}</ref>
* [[False positive]] readings can be due to various causes: [[liver]] disease, high [[rheumatoid factor]], [[inflammation]], [[cancer|malignancy]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[pregnancy]], recent [[surgery]] as well as advanced age {{citation needed|date=June 2011}}
* [[False negative]] readings can occur if the sample is taken either too early after thrombus formation or if testing is delayed for several days. Additionally, the presence of anti-coagulation can render the test negative because it prevents thrombus extension.
*False values may be obtained if the specimen collection tube is not sufficiently filled (false low value if underfilled and false high value if overfilled). This is due to the dilutional effect of the anticoagulant (the blood must be collected in a 9:1 blood to anticoagulant ratio).
* Likelihood ratios are derived from sensitivity and specificity to adjust pretest probability.

In interpretation of the d-dimer, for patients over age 50 a value of ageX10 may be abnormal.<ref name="pmid22072293">{{cite journal| author=van Es J, Mos I, Douma R, Erkens P, Durian M, Nizet T et al.| title=The combination of four different clinical decision rules and an age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off increases the number of patients in whom acute pulmonary embolism can safely be excluded. | journal=Thromb Haemost | year= 2012 | volume= 107 | issue= 1 | pages= 167–71 | pmid=22072293 | doi=10.1160/TH11-08-0587 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=22072293  }} </ref><ref name="pmid20354012">{{cite journal| author=Douma RA, le Gal G, Söhne M, Righini M, Kamphuisen PW, Perrier A et al.| title=Potential of an age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value to improve the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in older patients: a retrospective analysis of three large cohorts. | journal=BMJ | year= 2010 | volume= 340 | issue=  | pages= c1475 | pmid=20354012 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=clinical.uthscsa.edu/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=20354012 | doi=10.1136/bmj.c1475 }} </ref>
