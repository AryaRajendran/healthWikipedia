'''Mitochondrial myopathy''' is a type of [[myopathy]] associated with [[mitochondrial disease]].  On biopsy, the muscle tissue of patients with this disease usually demonstrate "ragged red" muscle fibers.  These ragged-red fibers contain mild accumulations of glycogen and neutral lipids, and may show an increased reactivity for [[succinate dehydrogenase]] and a decreased reactivity for [[cytochrome c oxidase]].  Inheritance is maternal ([[Non-Mendelian_inheritance#Extranuclear_inheritance|non-Mendelian extranuclear]]). There are several subcategories of mitochondrial myopathies.

==Treatment==
Although no cure currently exists, there is hope in treatment for this class of [[hereditary disease]]s with the use of an [[embryotic]] [[Protofection|mitochondrial transplant]].<ref Name="BBC_5_February_2008">{{cite web  | title =Three-parent embryo formed in lab  | work =Scientists believe they have made a potential breakthrough in the treatment of serious disease by creating a human embryo with three separate parents.  | publisher = BBC News  | date =  5 February 2008<!--, 11:13 GMT   -->| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7227861.stm  | format =web  | doi =  | accessdate = 2008-02-08 }}</ref>

=={{anchor|Variations of the Disease}}Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms include:

* [[Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like syndrome]] (MELAS) 
** Varying degrees of cognitive impairment and dementia
** [[Lactic acidosis]]
** [[Stroke]]s
** [[Transient ischemic attack]]s
** Hearing loss
** Weight loss

* [[Myoclonic epilepsy and ragged-red fibers]] (MERRF) 
** Progressive myoclonic epilepsy
** Clumps of diseased mitochondria accumulate in muscle fibers and appear as "ragged-red fibers" when muscle is stained with modified [[Gömöri trichrome stain]]
** Short stature

* [[Kearns-Sayre syndrome]] (KSS) 
** External [[ophthalmoplegia]]
** Cardiac conduction defects
** [[Sensorineural hearing loss]]

* [[Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia]] (CPEO) 
** Progressive [[ophthalmoparesis]] 
** Symptomatic overlap with other mitochondrial myopathies
