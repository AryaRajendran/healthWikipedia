'''Carbon tetrachloride''', also known by many other names (the most notable being '''carbon tet''' in the cleaning industry, and as Halon 104 or Freon 10 in HVAC; see Table for others), is the [[organic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] CCl<sub>4</sub>. It was formerly widely used in [[fire extinguisher]]s, as a precursor to [[refrigeration|refrigerant]]s, and as a [[cleaning agent]].  It is a colourless liquid with a "sweet" smell that can be detected at low levels.

Both carbon tetrachloride and tetrachloromethane are acceptable names under [[IUPAC nomenclature]].

==History and synthesis==
Carbon tetrachloride was originally synthesised by the French chemist [[Henri Victor Regnault]] in 1839 by the reaction of chloroform with chlorine,<ref>V. Regnault (1839) [http://books.google.com/books?id=px0AAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA104#v=onepage&q&f=false "Sur les chlorures de carbone CCl et CCl<sup>2</sup> "] (On the chlorides of carbon CCl and CCl<sup>2</sup> ), ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', vol. 70, pages 104-107.  Reprinted in German as: {{cite journal

}}</ref> but now it is mainly produced from [[methane]]:
:CH<sub>4</sub>  +  4 Cl<sub>2</sub>   →   CCl<sub>4</sub>  +  4 [[hydrogen chloride|HCl]]
The production often utilizes by-products of other [[halogenation|chlorination]] reactions, such as from the syntheses of [[dichloromethane]] and [[chloroform]].  Higher chlorocarbons are also subjected to "chlorinolysis:"
:[[Hexachloroethane|C<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>]]  +  Cl<sub>2</sub>  →  2 CCl<sub>4</sub>

Prior to the 1950s, carbon tetrachloride was manufactured by the chlorination of [[carbon disulfide]] at 105 to 130 °C:<ref name=Ross/>
:CS<sub>2</sub> + 3[[chlorine|Cl<sub>2</sub>]] → CCl<sub>4</sub> + [[Disulfur dichloride|S<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>]]

The production of carbon tetrachloride has steeply declined since the 1980s due to environmental concerns and the decreased demand for [[haloalkane|CFC]]s, which were derived from carbon tetrachloride.  In 1992, production in the U.S.-Europe-Japan was estimated at 720,000 tonnes.<ref name=Ross>Manfred Rossberg, Wilhelm Lendle, Gerhard Pfleiderer, Adolf Tögel, Eberhard-Ludwig Dreher, Ernst Langer, Heinz Jaerts, Peter Kleinschmidt, Heinz Strack, Richard Cook, Uwe Beck, Karl-August Lipper, Theodore R. Torkelson, Eckhard Löser, Klaus K. Beutel, “Chlorinated Hydrocarbons” in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2006 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.{{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a06_233.pub2}}</ref>

==Properties==
In the carbon tetrachloride [[molecule]], four [[chlorine]] [[atom]]s are positioned symmetrically as corners in a [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] configuration joined to a central [[carbon]] atom by single [[covalent bond]]s. Because of this symmetrical geometry, CCl<sub>4</sub> is non-polar. [[methane|Methane gas]] has the same structure, making carbon tetrachloride a [[halomethane]]. As a [[solvent]], it is well suited to dissolving other non-polar compounds, fats, and oils. It can also dissolve [[iodine]]. It is somewhat [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]], giving off [[vapor]]s with a smell characteristic of other chlorinated solvents, somewhat similar to the [[tetrachloroethylene]] smell reminiscent of [[dry cleaner]]s' shops.

Solid tetrachloromethane has 2 [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]]: crystalline II below &minus;47.5 °C (225.6 K) and crystalline I above &minus;47.5 °C.<ref>[http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C56235&Units=SI&Mask=4#Thermo-Phase Carbon tetrachloride<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

At &minus;47.3 °C it has [[Monoclinic crystal system|monoclinic]] crystal structure with space group ''C2/c'' and [[lattice constants]] ''a'' = 20.3, ''b'' = 11.6, ''c'' = 19.9 (.10<sup>−1</sup> nm), β = 111°.<ref name="chtas">F. Brezina, J. Mollin, R. Pastorek, Z. Sindelar. ''Chemicke tabulky anorganickych sloucenin'' (''Chemical tables of inorganic compounds''). SNTL, 1986.</ref> With a specific gravity greater than 1, carbon tetrachloride will be present as a [[dense nonaqueous phase liquid]] if sufficient quantities are spilled in the environment.

==Uses==
[[Image:070707-092045.jpg|thumb|160px|left|A brass, Pyrene carbon-tetrachloride, fire extinguisher.]]
In the 20th century, carbon tetrachloride was widely used as a [[dry cleaning]] [[solvent]], as a [[refrigerant]], and in [[lava lamp]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |title= A History of the Production and Use of Carbon Tetrachloride, Tetrachloroethylene, Trichloroethylene and 1,1,1-Trichloroethane in the United States: Part 1—Historical Background; Carbon Tetrachloride and Tetrachloroethylene |author=Doherty RE |issue=1 |year=2000 |pages=69–81 |doi=10.1006/enfo.2000.0010 |journal=Environmental Forensics | volume=1}}</ref> 

In 1910, The Pyrene Manufacturing Company of Delaware filed a patent for a using carbon tetrachloride to extinguish fires.<ref>{{US patent|1010870}}, filed April 5, 1910.</ref> The liquid vaporized and extinguished the flames by inhibiting the chemical chain reaction of the combustion process (it was an early 20th-century presupposition that the fire suppression ability of carbon tetrachloride relied on oxygen removal.) In 1911, they patented a small, portable extinguisher that used the chemical.<ref>{{US patent|1105263}}, filed Jan 7, 1911.</ref> This consisted of a [[brass]] bottle with an integrated handpump that was used to expel a jet of liquid toward the fire. As the container was unpressurized, it could be easily refilled after use.<ref>{{cite web
  | publisher= Vintage Fire Extinguishers
  | title = Pyrene Fire Extinguishers
  | url=http://www.vintagefe.com/pyrene.html
  |accessdate=23 December 2009}}
</ref>  Carbon tetrachloride was suitable for liquid and electrical fires and the extinguishers were often carried on aircraft or motor vehicles. 

One specialty use of carbon tetrachloride was in [[stamp collecting]], to reveal [[watermark]]s on postage stamps without damaging them. A small amount of the liquid was placed on the back of a stamp, sitting in a black glass or obsidian tray. The letters or design of the watermark could then be clearly seen.

However, once it became apparent that carbon tetrachloride exposure had severe adverse health effects, such as causing [[Acute liver failure|fulminant necrosis]], safer alternatives such as [[tetrachloroethylene]] were found for these applications, and its use in these roles declined from about 1940 onward. The fact that high temperatures cause it to react to produce [[phosgene]] made it especially hazardous when used against fires. This reaction also caused a rapid depletion of oxygen. Carbon tetrachloride persisted as a [[pesticide]] to kill insects in stored grain, but in 1970 it was banned in consumer products in the [[United States]].

Prior to the [[Montreal Protocol]], large quantities of carbon tetrachloride were used to produce the [[freon]] refrigerants R-11 ([[trichlorofluoromethane]]) and R-12 ([[dichlorodifluoromethane]]). However, these refrigerants play a role in [[ozone depletion]] and have been phased out.  Carbon tetrachloride is still used to manufacture less destructive refrigerants. Carbon tetrachloride has also been used in the detection of [[neutrinos]].

Carbon tetrachloride is one of the most potent [[hepatotoxins]] (toxic to the liver), and is widely used in scientific research to evaluate hepatoprotective agents.<ref name=TemaNord/><ref name=Seifert/>

===Reactivity===
Carbon tetrachloride has practically no [[flammable|flammability]] at lower temperatures.  Under high temperatures in air, it forms poisonous [[phosgene]].

Because it has no C-H bonds, carbon tetrachloride does not easily undergo [[free-radical reaction]]s. Hence, it is a useful solvent for [[halogenation]]s either by the elemental [[halogen]] or by a halogenation reagent such as [[N-Bromosuccinimide|''N''-bromosuccinimide]] (these conditions are known as Wohl-Ziegler Bromination).

In [[organic chemistry]], carbon tetrachloride serves as a source of chlorine in the [[Appel reaction]].

===Solvent===
It is used as a [[solvent]] in synthetic chemistry research, but, because of its adverse health effects, it is no longer commonly used, and in general chemists try to replace it with other solvents.<ref name=TemaNord/> It is sometimes useful as a solvent for [[infrared spectroscopy]], because there are no significant absorption bands > 1600&nbsp;cm<sup>−1</sup>. Because carbon tetrachloride does not have any hydrogen atoms, it was historically used in proton [[NMR spectroscopy]]. However, carbon tetrachloride is toxic, and its dissolving power is low.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/Spectrpy/nmr/nmr1.htm | title = Introduction to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy | publisher = [[Michigan State University]] | author = W. Reusch | work = Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry}}</ref> Its use has been largely superseded by [[deuterated solvents]]. Use of carbon tetrachloride in determination of oil has been replaced by various other solvents, such as [[tetrachloroethylene]].<ref name=TemaNord>[http://www.norden.org/pub/ebook/2003-516.pdf Use of Ozone Depleting Substances in Laboratories.
