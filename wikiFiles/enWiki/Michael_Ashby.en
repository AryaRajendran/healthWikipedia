'''Michael George Corbett Ashby''', [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians|M.R.C.P.]], [[Royal College of Physicians|F.R.C.P]]. (1 November 1914 &ndash; 10 December 2004) was a consultant [[neurologist]] at the [[Whittington Hospital]], [[London]] and an [[expert witness]] for the prosecution in the failed trial of suspected [[serial killer]] [[John Bodkin Adams]].<ref name=Cullen>Cullen, Pamela V., "A Stranger in Blood: The Case Files on Dr John Bodkin Adams", London, Elliott & Thompson, 2006, ISBN 1-904027-19-9</ref>

==Life==
Ashby (always known as "Mike") was born in [[London]], the son of Arthur Brian Ashby, a barrister and company chairman, and [[Margery Corbett-Ashby|Dame Margery Corbett-Ashby]].<ref name=Nieman>[http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/heritage/munksroll/munk_details.asp?ID=5373 Royal College of Physicians<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He was educated at [[Ashdown House Preparatory School]] and at [[Oundle School]]. He studied medicine at [[New College, Oxford|New College]], [[Oxford]], and at the [[London Hospital]]. Whilst at Oxford he rowed in the boat that won the [[Boat Race]] in 1936 and 1937.<ref name=Nieman/> At London Hospital he was United Hospitals [[light-heavyweight]] boxing champion for two successive years.<ref name=Nieman/>

==Career==
After qualifying, he was a house physician before joining the [[RAMC]], where he served from 1943<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=36182|supp=yes|startpage=4239|endpage=4240|date=21 September 1943|accessdate=2008-02-05}}</ref> until 1947, becoming a medical specialist in 1945.

On discharge from the Army in 1947 he worked at the [[National Hospital]] before returning to London Hospital as senior registrar to [[Russell Brain]] and [[Ronald Henson]].<ref name=Nieman/> In 1949 he was appointed consultant neurologist to the Whittington Hospital in north London, where he remained until his retirement in 1975. He succeeded [[Macdonald Critchley]] as consultant neurologist to the Royal Masonic Hospital in 1965, also retiring from there in 1975.

He also had a private [[Harley Street]] practice which involved much medico-legal work. He gave evidence in the [[Guenther Podola]] and [[John Bodkin Adams]] murder trials.<ref name=Nieman/> His evidence in the latter in 1957 has been criticised for being too indecisive.<ref name=Cullen/> While fellow witness [[Arthur Henry Douthwaite|Dr Arthur Douthwaite]] was adamant Adams had killed the victim, [[Edith Alice Morrell]], Ashby was more hesitant. In summing up, the judge called Ashby "the key witness", one "coming between the extremes", whose "border-line evidence" made it unsafe to convict.<ref name=Cullen/><ref>Patrick Devlin, Easing the passing: The trial of Doctor John Bodkin Adams, London, The Bodley Head, 1985</ref> Adams was acquitted of the Morrell charge but was due to be tried for the murder of [[Gertrude Hullett]] straight after. The prosecutor, [[Reginald Manningham-Buller]], withdrew the charge however by entering a [[nolle prosequi]] - partly because - in his words - the case would again be "based on the evidence of Dr Ashby".<ref name=Cullen/>

Adams was thought by [[Home Office]] [[pathologist]] [[Francis Camps]] to have killed 163 patients.<ref name=Cullen/>

==Family==
In 1944 Ashby married Pamela Mary Roffey. They had two sons and two daughters. Their elder daughter, Charlotte, died in a car crash in 1966, the day before her 21st birthday.<ref name=Nieman/>

==Personal interests==
Ashby was a [[Freemasonry|freemason]] and director of ceremonies at the London Hospital [[Masonic Lodge|Lodge]].<ref name=Nieman/>
