The '''corpus callosum''' ([[Latin]]: tough body), also known as the colossal [[commissure]], is a wide, flat bundle of neural fibers beneath the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] in the [[eutheria]]n [[brain]] at the longitudinal fissure. It connects the left and right [[cerebral hemisphere]]s and facilitates interhemispheric communication. It is the largest [[white matter]] structure in the brain, consisting of 200&ndash;250 million [[contralateral]] [[axon]]al projections.

==Anatomy==
The [[anatomical terms of location|posterior]] portion of the corpus callosum is called the [[splenium]]; the [[anatomical terms of location|anterior]] is called the [[Genu of the corpus callosum|genu]] (or "knee"); between the two is the truncus, or "body", of the corpus callosum. The part between the body and the splenium is often markedly thinned and thus referred to as the "isthmus". The [[Rostrum of corpus callosum|rostrum]] is the part of the corpus callosum that projects posteriorly and inferiorly from the anteriormost genu, as can be seen on the [[sagittal]] image of the  brain displayed on the right. The rostrum is so named for its resemblance to a bird's beak.
[[File:Choroid plexus.jpg|thumb|Corpus callosum]]
Thinner [[axon]]s in the genu connect the [[prefrontal cortex]] between the two halves of the brain, these form a fork-like bundle of fibers known as Forceps Minor. Thicker axons in the midbody of the corpus callosum, known as Trunk, interconnect areas of the  [[motor cortex|premotor and supplementary motor regions]] and [[motor cortex]], with proportionally more corpus dedicated to supplementary motor regions like Broca's area. The posterior body of the corpus, known as splenium, communicates  [[somatosensory]] information between the two halves of the [[parietal lobe]] and [[visual cortex|visual center]] at the [[occipital lobe]], these fibers are known as Forceps Major.<ref name="Caminiti">{{cite journal |first1=Roberto |last1=Caminiti |first2=Hassan |last2=Ghaziri |first3=Ralf |last3=Galuske |first4=Patrick R. |last4=Hof |first5=Giorgio M. |last5=Innocenti |doi=10.1073/pnas.0907655106 |bibcode=2009PNAS..10619551C |jstor=25593230 |pmid=19875694 |title=Evolution amplified processing with temporally dispersed slow neuronal connectivity in primates |year=2009 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=106 |issue=46 |pages=19551–6 |pmc=2770441}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.05.044 |title=Topography of the human corpus callosum revisited—Comprehensive fiber tractography using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging |year=2006 |last1=Hofer |first1=Sabine |last2=Frahm |first2=Jens |journal=NeuroImage |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=989–94 |pmid=16854598}}</ref>

==Species Differences==
The corpus callosum is found only in placental mammals (the [[eutheria]]ns), while it is absent in [[monotreme]]s and [[marsupial]]s,<ref>{{cite journal |bibcode=1933PNAS...19..609K |jstor=86284 |title=Absence of the Corpus callosum as a Mendelizing Character in the House Mouse |author1=Keeler |first1=Clyde E. |volume=19 |year=1933 |pages=609–11 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |doi=10.1073/pnas.19.6.609 |pmid=16587795 |issue=6 |pmc=1086100}}</ref> as well as other vertebrates such as birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish<ref>Sarnat, Harvey B., and Paolo Curatolo (2007).

In [[primate]]s, the speed of nerve transmission depends on its degree of [[myelination]], or lipid coating. This is reflected by the diameter of the nerve axon. In most primates, axonal diameter increases in proportion to brain size to compensate for the increased distance to travel for neural impulse transmission. This allows the brain to coordinate sensory and motor impulses. However, the scaling of overall brain size and increased  [[myelination]] has not occurred between [[chimpanzee]]s and [[human]]s. This has resulted in the human corpus callosum's requiring double the time for interhemispheric communication as a [[macaque]]'s.<ref name="Caminiti"/> [[Image:LocationOfHypothalamus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sagittal]] post-mortem section through the midline brain.

==Absence and malformations==
[[Agenesis of the corpus callosum]] (ACC) is a rare [[congenital disorder]] in which the corpus callosum is partially or completely absent.  ACC is usually diagnosed within the first two years of life and may manifest as a severe syndrome in infancy or childhood, as a milder condition in young adults, or as an asymptomatic incidental finding.  Initial symptoms of ACC usually include seizures, which may be followed by feeding problems and delays in holding the head erect, sitting, standing, and walking.  Other possible symptoms may include impairments in mental and physical development, hand-eye coordination, and visual and auditory memory. [[Hydrocephaly]] may also occur. In mild cases, symptoms such as seizures, repetitive speech, or headaches may not appear for years.

ACC is usually non-fatal.  Treatment usually involves management of symptoms, such as hydrocephaly and seizures, if they occur.  Although many children with the disorder will lead normal lives and have average intelligence, careful neuropsychological testing reveals subtle differences in higher cortical function compared to individuals of the same age and education without ACC. Children with ACC accompanied by developmental delay and/or seizure disorders should be screened for metabolic disorders.<ref>{{cite web|title=NINDS Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum Information Page: NINDS|url=http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/artic/ninds_agenesis_of_the_corpus_callosum_information_page_ninds.htm|work=RightDiagnosis.com|accessdate=Aug. 30, 2011}}</ref> 

In addition to agenesis of the corpus callosum, similar conditions are hypogenesis (partial formation), dysgenesis (malformed), and hypoplasia (underdevelopment, including too thin).

Recent studies have also linked possible correlations between corpus callosum malformation and [[autism spectrum]] disorders (ASD).<ref>{{cite web

[[Kim Peek]], a [[Savant syndrome|savant]] and the inspiration behind the movie ''[[Rain Man]]'', was found with agenesis of the corpus callosum.

== Sexual Dimorphism ==
The corpus callosum and its relation to sex has been a subject of debate in the scientific and lay communities for over a century. Initial research in the early 20th century claimed the corpus to be different in size between men and women. That research was in turn questioned, and ultimately gave way to more advanced imaging techniques that appeared to refute earlier correlations. The new advent of physiologic based imaging has altered the paradigm dramatically, with the relationship between gender and the corpus callosum becoming a subject of increasing numbers of studies in recent years.

===Original studies and dispute===
The first study of the corpus with relation to gender was by R. B. Bean, a Philadelphia anatomist, who suggested in 1906 that "exceptional size of the corpus callosum may mean exceptional intellectual activity" and that there were measurable differences between men and women. Perhaps reflecting the political climate of the times, he went on to claim differences in the size of the callosum across different races. His research was ultimately refuted by Franklin Mall, the director of his own laboratory.<ref name="Bishop">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0149-7634(96)00049-8 |title=Sex Differences in the Human Corpus Callosum: Myth or Reality? |year=1997 |last1=Bishop |first1=Katherine M. |last2=Wahlsten |first2=Douglas |journal=Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=581–601 |pmid=9353793}}</ref>

Of more mainstream impact was a 1982 ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'' article by [[Ralph Holloway|Holloway]] and Utamsing that suggested sex difference in human brain [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], which related to differences in cognitive ability.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.7089533 |title=Sexual dimorphism in the human corpus callosum |year=1982 |last1=Delacoste-Utamsing |first1=C |last2=Holloway |first2=R. |journal=Science |volume=216 |issue=4553 |pages=1431–2 |pmid=7089533}}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' published an article in 1992 that suggested that, because the corpus is "often wider in the brains of women than in those of men, it may allow for greater cross-talk between the hemispheres&mdash;possibly the basis for women’s intuition."<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sizing up the sexes|journal=Time|author=C Gorman|date=20 January 1992|pages=36–43|nopp=As cited by Bishop and Wahlsten}}</ref>

More recent publications in the psychology literature have raised doubt as to whether the anatomic size of the corpus is actually different. A meta-analysis of 49 studies since 1980 found that, contrary to de Lacoste-Utamsing and Holloway, no sex difference could be found in the size of the corpus callosum, whether or not account was taken of larger male brain size.<ref name="Bishop" /> A study in 2006 using thin slice MRI showed no difference in thickness of the corpus when accounting for the size of the subject.<ref name="Luders">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.wnr.0000227987.77304.cc |title=Gender effects on callosal thickness in scaled and unscaled space |year=2006 |last1=Luders |first1=Eileen |last2=Narr |first2=Katherine L. |last3=Zaidel |first3=Eran |last4=Thompson |first4=Paul M. |last5=Toga |first5=Arthur W. |journal=NeuroReport |volume=17 |issue=11 |pages=1103–6 |pmid=16837835}}</ref>

===Physiologic imaging ===
The ability to evaluate the form and function of the human mind has undergone almost exponential growth and a paradigm shift in recent years. Magnetic resonance imaging, for example, is now being used to analyze physiology in addition to anatomy. Using [[Diffusion MRI|diffusion tensor sequences]] on MRI machines, the rate that molecules diffuse in and out of a specific area of tissue, directionality or anisotropy, and rates of metabolism can be measured. These sequences have found consistent sex differences in human corpus callosal morphology and microstructure.{{which|date=February 2013}}<ref name="pmid14527611">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00313-6 |title=Characterization of sexual dimorphism in the human corpus callosum |year=2003 |last1=Dubb |first1=Abraham |last2=Gur |first2=Ruben |last3=Avants |first3=Brian |last4=Gee |first4=James |journal=NeuroImage |volume=20 |pages=512–9 |pmid=14527611 |issue=1}}</ref><ref name="pmid15511657">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cogbrainres.2004.07.002 |title=Effects of handedness and gender on macro- and microstructure of the corpus callosum and its subregions: A combined high-resolution and diffusion-tensor MRI study |year=2004 |last1=Westerhausen |first1=René |last2=Kreuder |first2=Frank |last3=Sequeira |first3=Sarah Dos Santos |last4=Walter |first4=Christof |last5=Woerner |first5=Wolfgang |last6=Wittling |first6=Ralf Arne |last7=Schweiger |first7=Elisabeth |last8=Wittling |first8=Werner |journal=Cognitive Brain Research |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=418–26 |pmid=15511657}}</ref><ref name="pmid15891572">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00001756-200505310-00003 |title=Sex differences in the human corpus callosum: Diffusion tensor imaging study |year=2005 |last1=Shin |first1=Yong-Wook |last2=Jin Kim |first2=Dae |last3=Hyon Ha |first3=Tae |last4=Park |first4=Hae-Jeong |last5=Moon |first5=Won-Jin |last6=Chul Chung |first6=Eun |last7=Min Lee |first7=Jong |last8=Young Kim |first8=In |last9=Kim |first9=Sun I. |journal=NeuroReport |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=795–8 |pmid=15891572}}</ref>

===Gender identity disorder===
Research has been done on the shape of the corpus callosum in those with [[gender identity disorder]]. Researchers were able to demonstrate that the shape dimorphism of the corpus callosum at birth in biological males who self-identified as female was actually reversed, and that the same held true for biological females who self-identified as male. The publishers of this article argued that the shape of the corpus callosum defined the ''mental sex'' of individuals over their ''physical sex''.<ref name="gid"/>

The relationship between the corpus callosum and gender remains an active subject of debate in the scientific and lay community.

==Brain Split Procedure==
The cerebral cortex is divided into two hemispheres and is connected by the corpus callosum. A procedure that helps patients to alleviate the severity of seizures is called split brain procedure. The result is that a seizure that starts in one hemisphere is isolated in that hemisphere since there is no longer a connection to the other side.  However, this procedure is dangerous and risky.
