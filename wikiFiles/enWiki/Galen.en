'''Aelius Galenus''' or '''Claudius Galenus''' (AD 129&ndash;{{circa|200}}/{{circa|216}}), better known as '''Galen of Pergamon''' (modern-day [[Bergama]], [[Turkey]]), was a prominent [[Ancient Roman|Roman]] (of [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] ethnicity) [[physician]], [[surgeon]] and [[Philosophy|philosopher]].<ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=HPjqJWakX7IC&pg=PA63&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Life, death, and entertainment in the Roman Empire]''".

The son of [[Aelius Nicon]], a wealthy [[architect]] with scholarly interests, Galen received a comprehensive education that prepared him for a successful career as a physician and philosopher. He traveled extensively, exposing himself to a wide variety of medical theories and discoveries before settling in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], where he served prominent members of Roman society and eventually was given the position of personal physician to several [[Roman Emperor|emperors]].

Galen's understanding of anatomy and [[medicine]] was principally influenced by the then-current theory of [[humorism]], as advanced by many [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] physicians such as [[Hippocrates]]. His theories dominated and influenced [[Western culture|Western]] medical science for more than 1,300 years. His anatomical reports, based mainly on [[dissection]] of [[Old World monkey|monkeys]], especially the [[Barbary Macaque]], and [[pig]]s, remained uncontested until 1543, when printed descriptions and illustrations of human dissections were published in the seminal work ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' by [[Andreas Vesalius]]<ref name=Vesalius1543>{{cite book

==Early life: AD 129–161==
Galen's name {{lang-el|Γαληνός}}, ''Galēnos'' comes from the adjective "γαληνός", "calm".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dgalhno%2Fs γαληνός],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref>

Galen describes his early life in ''On the affections of the mind''. He was born in September 129 AD;<ref name="nutton73"/> his father, [[Aelius Nicon]], was a wealthy [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]], an architect and builder, with eclectic interests including philosophy, mathematics, logic, astronomy, agriculture and literature. Galen describes his father as a "highly amiable, just, good and benevolent man". At that time [[Pergamon]] was a major cultural and intellectual centre, noted for its library ([[Eumenes II]]), second only to that in Alexandria,<ref name="brock"/><ref name="metzger">[http://books.google.ca/books?id=NrEeAAAAIAAJ Metzger BM. New Testament Studies: Philological, Versional, and Patristic. BRILL 1980 ISBN 90-04-06163-0, ISBN 978-90-04-06163-7]</ref>
and attracted both [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and [[Platonism|Platonic]] philosophers, to whom Galen was exposed at age 14. His studies also took in each of the principal philosophical systems of the time, including [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Epicurean]]. His father had planned a traditional career for Galen in philosophy or politics and took care to expose him to literary and philosophical influences. However, Galen states that in around 145 AD his father had a dream in which the god [[Asclepius]] (Aesculapius) appeared and commanded Nicon to send his son to study medicine. Again, no expense was spared, and following his earlier liberal education, at 16 he began studies at the prestigious local sanctuary or [[Asclepeion|Asclepieum]] dedicated to Asclepius, god of medicine, as a ''θεραπευτής'' (therapeutes, or attendant) for four years. There he came under the influence of men like [[Aeschrion of Pergamon]], Stratonicus and Satyrus. Asclepiea functioned as spas or sanitoria to which the sick would come to seek the ministrations of the priesthood. The temple at Pergamon was eagerly sought by Romans in search of a cure. It was also the haunt of notable people such as Claudius Charax the historian, [[Aelius Aristides]] the orator, [[Polemon|Polemo]] the sophist, and Cuspius Rufinus the Consul.<ref name="nutton73"/>

In 148, when he was 19, his father died, leaving him independently wealthy. He then followed the advice he found in Hippocrates' teaching<ref>[http://daedalus.umkc.edu/hippocrates/HippocratesLoeb1/page.66.php?size=240x320 Hippocrates. Airs, Waters, and Places. Jones (ed.) 70-2]</ref> and travelled and studied widely including such destinations as [[Smyrna]] (now [[Izmir]]), [[Roman Corinth|Corinth]], [[Crete]], [[Cilicia]] (now [[Çukurova]]), [[Cyprus]], and finally the great medical school of [[Medicine in ancient Greece|Alexandria]], exposing himself to the various schools of thought in medicine. In 157, aged 28, he returned to Pergamon as physician to the gladiators of the High Priest of Asia, one of the most influential and wealthiest men in Asia. Galen claims that the High Priest chose him over other physicians after he eviscerated an ape and challenged other physicians to repair the damage. When they refused, Galen performed the surgery himself and in so doing won the favor of the High Priest of Asia. Over his four years there he learnt the importance of diet, fitness, hygiene and preventive measures, as well as living anatomy, and the treatment of fractures and severe trauma, referring to their [[wounds]] as "windows into the body". Only five deaths among the gladiators occurred while he held the post, compared to sixty in his predecessor's time, a result which is generally ascribed to the attention he paid to their wounds. At the same time he pursued studies in theoretical medicine and philosophy.<ref name="nutton73"/><ref name="ustun">Ustun C. Galen and his anatomic eponym: Vein of Galen.

==Later years: AD 162–217==
Galen went to [[Rome]] in 162 AD and made his mark as a practicing physician. His impatience brought him into conflict with other doctors and he felt menaced by them. His demonstrations there antagonized the less able and original physicians in the city. They plotted against him and he feared he might be driven away or poisoned so he left the city.<ref name="D.E. Eichholz 1951, p. 60–71">[D.E. Eichholz, 1951, Galen and His Environment, Greece & Rome 20 no. 59, Cambridge University Press, p. 60–71]</ref>

Rome then engaged in the foreign wars in 161 AD. [[Marcus Aurelius]] and his colleague [[Lucius Verus]] were in the north fighting the [[Marcomanni]].<ref>[Elizabeth C. Evans, 1956, Galen the Physician as Physiognomist, American Philological Association]</ref> During the autumn of 169 AD when Roman troops were returning to [[Aquileia]], the great plague broke out and the emperor summoned Galen back to Rome. He was ordered to accompany Marcus and Verus to Germany as the court physician. In the following spring Marcus was persuaded to release Galen after receiving a report that [[Asclepius]] was against the project.<ref name="M.L. Littman p. 243–255">[R.J. Littman and M.L. Littman, 1973 Galen and the Antonine Plague, The American Journal of Philology 94 no. 3, p. 243–255]</ref> He was left behind to act as physician to the imperial heir [[Commodus]]. It was here in court that Galen wrote extensively on medical subjects. Ironically, Lucius Verus died in 169, and Marcus Aurelius himself died in 180, both victims of the plague.

Galen was the physician to Commodus for much of the emperor’s life and treated his common illnesses. According to Dio Cassius 72.14.3–4, in about 189 AD, under Commodus’ reign, a pestilence occurred, the largest of which he had knowledge, in which 2,000 people died in Rome each day. It is most likely that this was the same plague that struck Rome during Marcus Aurelius’ reign.<ref name="M.L. Littman p. 243–255"/>

Galen became physician to [[Septimius Severus]] during his reign in Rome. Galen compliments Severus and [[Caracalla]] on keeping a supply of drugs for their friends and mentions three cases in which they had been of use in 198 AD.<ref name="D.E. Eichholz 1951, p. 60–71"/>

===The Antonine Plague===
{{Main|Antonine Plague}}
The Antonine Plague was named after Marcus Aurelius’ family name of Antoninus. It was also known as the Plague of Galen and holds an important place in medicinal history because of its association with Galen. Galen had first hand knowledge of the disease. He was in Rome when it struck in 166 AD, and was also present in the winter of 168–69 during an outbreak among troops stationed at [[Aquileia]]. He had experience with the epidemic, referring to it as very long lasting, and describes its symptoms and his treatment of it. Unfortunately, his references to the plague are scattered and brief. Galen was not trying to present a description of the disease so that it could be recognized in future generations; he was more interested in the treatment and physical effects of the disease. For example, in his writings about a young man afflicted with the plague, he concentrated on the treatment of internal and external ulcerations.<ref name="M.L. Littman p. 243–255"/> According to Niebuhr "this pestilence must have raged with incredible fury; it carried off innumerable victims. The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflected upon it by the plague which visited it in the reign of M. Aurelius."
The mortality rate of the plague was 7–10 percent; the outbreak in 165–6–168 would have caused approximately 3.5 to 5 million deaths. Otto Seek believes that over half the population of the empire perished. J. F. Gilliam believes that the Antonine plague probably caused more deaths than any other epidemic during the empire before the mid-3rd century.<ref name="M.L. Littman p. 243–255"/> It is believed that the Antonine Plague was [[smallpox]], because though his description is incomplete, Galen gave enough information to enable a firm identification of the disease.

Galen notes that the [[exanthema]] covered the victim’s entire body and was usually black. The exanthem became rough and scabby where there was no ulceration. He states that those who were going to survive developed a black exanthem. According to Galen, it was black because of a remnant of blood putrefied in a fever blister that was pustular. His writings state that raised blisters were present in the Antonine plague, usually in the form of a blistery rash. Galen states that the skin rash was close to the one [[Thucydides]] described.<ref name="M.L. Littman p. 243–255"/> Galen describes symptoms of the alimentary tract via a patient’s diarrhea and stools. If the stool was very black, the patient died. He says that the amount of black stools varied. It depended on the severity of the intestinal lesions. He observes that in cases where the stool was not black, the black exanthum appeared.<ref name="M.L. Littman p. 243–255"/> Galen describes the symptoms of fever, vomiting, fetid breath, [[catarrh]], cough and ulceration of the larynx and trachea.<ref name="M.L. Littman p. 243–255"/>

===Eudemus===
When [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] philosopher Eudemus became ill with [[Plasmodium malariae|Quartan fever]], Galen felt obliged to treat him "since he was my teacher and I happened to live nearby."<ref>[Luis Garcia-Ballester, 2002, Galen and Galenism, Burlington: Ashgate-Variorum, page 1641]</ref> Galen wrote: "I return to the case of Eudemus. He was thoroughly attacked by the three attacks of quartan ague, and the doctors had given him up, as it was now mid-winter." <ref>Arthur John Brock, 1929, ''Greek Medicine'', London: J.M. Dent and Songs, Ltd., page 207.]</ref> Some Roman physicians criticized Galen for his use of the [[prognosis]] in his treatment of Eudemus. This practice conflicted with the then-current [[Standard_of_care#Medical_standard_of_care|standard of care]], which relied upon [[divination]] and [[mysticism]]. Galen retaliated against his detractors by defending his own methods. Garcia-Ballester quotes Galen as saying: "In order to diagnose, one must observe and reason. This was the basis of his criticism of the doctors who proceeded alogos and askeptos." <ref>[Luis Garcia-Ballester, 2002, Galen and Galenism, Burlington: Ashgate-Variorum, page 1663]</ref> However, Eudemus warned Galen that engaging in conflict with these physicians could lead to his assassination. "Eudemus said this, and more to the same effect; he added that if they were not able to harm me by unscrupulous conduct they would proceed to attempts at poisoning. Among other things he told me that, some ten years before, a young man had come to the city and had given, like me practical demonstrations of the resources of our art; this young man was put to death by poison, together with two servants who accompanied him."<ref>Arthur John Brock, 1929, ''Greek Medicine'', London: J.M. Dent and Songs, Ltd., page 212.]</ref>

Garcia-Ballester says the following of Galen’s use of prognosis: "In modern medicine, we are used to distinguishing between the diagnostic judgment (the scientific knowledge of what a patient has) and the prognostic judgment (the conjecture about what will happen to him.) Galen, like the Hippocratics, was not. For him, to understand a clinical case technically, ‘to diagnose’, was among other things, to know with greater or lesser certainty the outcome fore the patient, ‘to prognosticate’. Prognosis, then, is one of the essential problems and most important objectives of Galenic diagnosis. Galen was concerned to distinguish it from divination or prophecy, both to improve diagnosis technically and to enhance the physician’s reputation."<ref>[Luis Garcia-Ballester, 2002, Galen and Galenism, Burlington: Ashgate-Variorum, page 1640]</ref>

===Death===
The 11th-century ''[[Suda]]'' lexicon states that Galen died at the age of 70, therefore about the year 199. However, there is a reference in Galen's treatise ''"On Theriac to Piso"'' (which may however be spurious) to events of 204. There are also statements in Arabic sources that he died at 87, after 17 years studying medicine and 70 practicing it, therefore about 217. Nutton<ref>Nutton V. Ancient Medicine. Routledge, 2004 226–7</ref> believes that ''"On Theriac to Piso"'' is genuine, the Arabic sources are correct and that the ''Suda'' has erroneously interpreted the 70 years of Galen's career in the Arabic tradition as referring to his whole lifespan. Boudon-Millot<ref>Boudon-Millot V (ed. and trans.) Galien: Introduction générale; Sur l'ordre de ses propres livres; Sur ses propres livres; Que l'excellent médecin est aussi philosophe Paris: Les Belles Lettres. 2007, LXXVII-LXXX</ref> more or less concurs and favours a date of 216.

==Contributions to medicine==
Galen contributed a substantial amount to the Hippocratic understanding of pathology. Under Hippocrates’ bodily humors theory, differences in human moods come as a consequence of imbalances in one of the four bodily fluids: blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. Galen promoted this theory and the typology of [[Four Temperaments|human temperaments]]. An imbalance of each humor corresponded with a particular human temperament (blood&mdash;sanguine, black bile&mdash;melancholic, yellow bile&mdash;choleric, and phlegm&mdash;phlegmatic). Individuals with sanguine temperaments are extroverted and social. Choleric people have energy, passion and charisma. Melancholics are creative, kind and considerate. Phlegmatic temperaments are characterized by dependability, kindness, and affection.<ref name="Mark Grant 2000">[Mark Grant, 2000, Galen on Food and Diet, Routledge]</ref>

Galen’s principal interest was in human anatomy, but Roman law had prohibited the dissection of human cadavers since about 150 BC.<ref>'Tragically, the prohibition of human dissection by Rome in 150 BC arrested this progress and few of their findings survived', Arthur Aufderheide, 'The Scientific Study of Mummies' (2003), page 5</ref> Because of this restriction, Galen performed anatomical dissections on living ([[vivisection]]) and dead animals, mostly focusing on pigs and [[primate]]s.<ref name="brock"/> This work turned out to be particularly useful because in most cases, the anatomical structures of these animals closely mirror those of humans. Galen clarified the anatomy of the trachea and was the first to demonstrate that the larynx generates the voice.<ref>{{cite book

Among Galen’s major contributions to medicine was his work on the [[circulatory system]]. He was the first to recognize that there were distinct differences between [[venous blood|venous]] (dark) and [[artery|arterial]] (bright) blood. Although his many anatomical experiments on animal models led him to a more complete understanding of the circulatory system, [[nervous system]], [[respiratory system]] and other structures, his work was not without scientific inaccuracies.<ref name="Galen on the brain"/> Galen believed that the circulatory system consisted of two separate one-way systems of distribution, rather than a single unified system of circulation. His understanding was that venous blood was generated in the liver, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. He posited that arterial blood originated in the heart, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. The blood was then regenerated in either the liver or the heart, completing the cycle.<ref name="Mark Grant 2000"/> Galen also believed in the existence of a group of blood vessels he called the [[rete mirabile]], in the carotid sinus .<ref name="Mark Grant 2000"/> Both of these theories of the circulation of blood were later shown to be incorrect.<ref name=Furley1984/> 

In his work ''De motu musculorum'', Galen explained the difference between [[motor nerve|motor]] and [[sensory nerve]]s, discussed the concept of [[muscle tone]] and explained the difference between [[agonist (muscle)|agonists]] and [[antagonist (muscle)|antagonists]]. 

Galen was also a highly skilled surgeon, and he performed surgical operations on human patients. Many of the procedures and techniques that he utilized would not be used again for centuries. Of particular note are procedures that Galen performed on patients’ brains and eyes.<ref name="Galen on the brain"/> In order to correct [[cataract]]s in patients, Galen performed an operation that was similar to what is performed by contemporary [[ophthalmologist]]s. Using a needle-shaped instrument, Galen attempted to remove the cataract from behind the lens of the eye.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1034789/ Galen on anatomical procedures]</ref> His surgical experiments included using ligatures on the arteries of living animals.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lois N. Magner|title=A History of Medicine|publisher=CRC Press|year=1992|pages=91}}</ref>

At first reluctantly, but then with increasing vigour, Galen promoted Hippocratic teaching, including [[Venipuncture|venesection]] and [[bloodletting]], then unknown in Rome. This was sharply criticised by the [[Erasistratus|Erasistrateans]], who predicted dire outcomes, believing that it was not blood but ''[[Pneuma (Stoic)|pneuma]]'' that flowed in the veins. Galen, however, staunchly defended venesection in his three books on the subject,<ref>Brain P (trans.) Galen on Bloodletting: A study of the origins, development and validity of his opinions, with a translation of the three works. Cambridge 1986</ref> and in his demonstrations and public disputations.

==Contributions to philosophy==
Although the main focus of his work was on medicine, anatomy, and physiology, Galen also wrote about logic and philosophy. His writings were influenced by earlier Greek and Roman thinkers, including [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[Stoicism|Stoics]]. Galen was concerned to combine philosophical thought with medical practice, as in his brief work ''That the Best Physician is also a Philosopher''. He took aspects from each group and combined them with his original thought. He regarded medicine as an interdisciplinary field that was best practiced by utilizing theory, observation, and experimentation in conjunction.

Several schools of thought existed within the medical field during Galen's lifetime, the main two being the Empiricists and Rationalists (also called Dogmatists or Philosophers), with the Methodists being a smaller group. The Empiricists emphasized the importance of physical practice and experimentation, or "active learning" in the medical discipline. In direct opposition to the Empiricists were the Rationalists, who valued the study of established teachings in order to create new theories in the name of medical advancements. The Methodists formed somewhat of a middle ground, as they were not as experimental as the Empiricists, nor as theoretical as the Rationalists. The Methodists mainly utilized pure observation, showing greater interest in studying the natural course of ailments than making efforts to find remedies. Galen's education had exposed him to the four major schools of thought (Platonists, Peripatetics, Stoics, Epicureans), with teachers from the Rationalist sect and from the Empiricist sect.

==Published works==
{{Main|Galenic corpus}}
Galen may have produced more work than any author in antiquity, rivaling the quantity of work issued from [[Augustine of Hippo]].<ref name="kotrc">Kotrc RF, Walters KR. A bibliography of the Galenic Corpus. A newly researched list and arrangement of the titles of the treatises extant in Greek, Latin, and Arabic.

In AD 191, a fire in the [[Temple_of_Peace,_Rome#Temple_of_Peace|Temple of Peace]] destroyed many of his works, particularly treatises on philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Because Galen's works were not translated into Latin in the ancient period, and because of the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West, the study of Galen, along with the Greek medical tradition as a whole, went into decline in Western Europe during the [[Early Middle Ages]], when very few Latin scholars could read Greek. However, Galen and the [[Ancient Greek medicine|ancient Greek medical tradition]] generally continued to be studied and followed in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], commonly known as the Byzantine Empire. All of the extant Greek manuscripts of Galen were copied by Byzantine scholars. In the Abbasid period (after 750 AD) [[Arab Muslims]] began to be interested in Greek scientific and medical texts for the first time, and had some of Galen's texts translated into Arabic, often by Syrian Christian scholars (see below). As a result some texts of Galen exist only in Arabic translation,<ref name="iep">[http://www.iep.utm.edu/g/galen.htm Boylen M. Galen. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]</ref> while others exist only in medieval Latin translations of the Arabic. In some cases scholars have even attempted to translate from the Latin or Arabic back into Greek where the original is lost.<ref name="kotrc"/><ref>[http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=classics_papers Rosen RM.

Even in his own time, forgeries and unscrupulous editions of his work were a problem, prompting him to write ''On his Own Books''. Forgeries in Latin, Arabic or Greek continued until the [[Renaissance]]. Some of Galen's treatises have appeared under many different titles over the years. Sources are often in obscure and difficult to access journals or repositories. Although written in Greek, by convention the works are referred to by Latin titles, and often by merely abbreviations of those. No single authoritative collection of his work exists, and controversy remains as to the authenticity of a number of works attributed to Galen. Consequently research on Galen's work is fraught with hazard.<ref name="metzger"/><ref name="kotrc"/>

Various attempts have been made to classify Galen's vast output. For instance Coxe (1846) lists a Prolegomena, or introductory books, followed by 7 classes of treatise embracing Physiology (28 vols.), Hygiene (12), Aetiology (19), Semeiotics (14), Pharmacy (10), Blood letting (4) and Therapeutics (17), in addition to 4 of aphorisms, and spurious works.<ref name="Coxe">[[John Redman Coxe|Coxe, John Redman]], [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1988&chapter=128229&layout=html&Itemid=27 ''The Writings of Hippocrates and Galen.

Over 20,000 pages in length, it is divided into 22 volumes, with 676 index pages.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Many of Galen's works are included in the ''[[Thesaurus Linguae Graecae]]'', a digital library of Greek literature started in 1972.

==Legacy==

===Late antiquity===
In his time, Galen's reputation as both physician and philosopher was legendary,<ref name="nutton84a">Nutton V. Galen in the eyes of his contemporaries. BHM 58(3) fall 1984 315–24</ref> the Emperor Marcus Aurelius describing him as "Primum sane medicorum esse, philosophorum autem solum" (first among doctors and unique among philosophers ''Praen 14: 660''). Other contemporary authors in the Greek world confirm this including [[Theodotus of Byzantium|Theodotus the Shoemaker]], [[Athenaeus]] and [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]]. The 7th-century poet [[George Pisida|George of Pisida]] went so far as to refer to Christ as a second and neglected Galen.<ref>George of Pisida. Hexameron 1.1588f</ref> Galen continued to exert an important influence over the theory and practice of medicine until the mid-17th century in the Byzantine and Arabic worlds and Europe. Hippocrates and Galen form important landmarks of 600 years of Greek medicine. A. J. Brock describes them as representing the foundation and apex respectively.<ref name="brock">Arthur John Brock (translator), ''Introduction. Galen. On the Natural Faculties''. Edinburgh 1916</ref> A few centuries after Galen, [[Palladius (physician)|Palladius Iatrosophista]] stated, in his commentary on Hippocrates, that Hippocrates sowed and Galen reaped.

Thus Galen summarised and synthesised the work of his predecessors, and it is in Galen's words (Galenism) that Greek medicine was handed down to subsequent generations, such that Galenism became the means by which Greek medicine was known to the world. Frequently this was in the form of restating and reinterpreting, such as in [[Magnus of Nisibis]]' 4th-century work on urine, which was in turn translated into Arabic.<ref name="nutton84"/> Yet the full importance of his contributions was not appreciated till long after his death.<ref name="brock"/> Galen's rhetoric and prolificity were so powerful as to convey the impression that there was little left to learn. The term Galenism has subsequently taken on both a positive and pejorative meaning as one that transformed medicine in late antiquity yet so dominated subsequent thinking as to stifle further progress.<ref name="nutton84"/>

After the collapse of the Western Empire the study of Galen and other Greek works almost disappeared in the Latin West. In contrast, in the predominantly Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman empire (Byzantium), many commentators of the subsequent centuries, such as [[Oribasius]], physician to the emperor [[Julian the apostate|Julian]] who compiled a ''Synopsis'' in the 4th century, preserved and disseminated Galen's works, making Galenism more accessible. Nutton refers to these authors as the "medical refrigerators of antiquity".<ref name="brock"/><ref name="nutton84"/> In late antiquity medical writing veered increasingly in the direction of the theoretical at the expense of the practical, with many authors merely debating Galenism. Magnus of Nisibis was a pure theorist, as were [[John of Alexandria]] and Agnellus of Ravenna with their lectures on Galen's ''De Sectis''.<ref>Temkin O. Studies on late Alexandrian medicine. Bull Hist Med 3: 405–30, 1935</ref> So strong was Galenism that other authors such as Hippocrates began to be seen through a Galenic lens, while his opponents became marginalised and other medical sects such as Asclepiadism slowly disappeared.<ref name="nutton84"/> Greek medicine was part of Greek culture, and Syrian Eastern Christians came in contact with it while the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantium) ruled Syria and Western Mesopotamia, regions that were conquered from Byzantium in the 7th century by Arab Muslims. After 750 AD, Muslims had these Syrian Christians make the first translations of Galen into Arabic. From then on Galen and the Greek medical tradition in general became assimilated into the medieval and early modern Islamic Middle East.<ref name="brock"/>

===Influence on Islamic medicine===
The first major translator of Galen into Arabic was the Syrian Christian [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]]. Hunayn translated (c. 830–870) 129 works of "Jalinos"<ref>[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7100.html Dear P. Revolutionizing the Sciences: European Knowledge and Its Ambitions, 1500–1700. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press (2001), 37–39]</ref> into [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. One of the Arabic translations, ‘Kitab ila Aglooqan fi Shifa al Amraz’, which is extant in the Library of [[Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences|Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine & Sciences]], is regarded as a masterpiece of Galen's literary works. A part of the Alexandrian compendium of Galen’s work, this 10th century manuscript comprises two parts that include details regarding various types of fevers (Humyat) and different inflammatory conditions of the body. More importantly, it includes details of more than 150 single and compound formulations of both herbal and animal origin. The book provides an insight into understanding the traditions and methods of treatment in the Greek (Unani) and Roman eras. In addition, this book provides a direct source for the study of more than 150 single and compound drugs used during the Greco-Roman period.

Galen's insistence on a rational systematic approach to medicine set the template for [[Islamic medicine]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, which rapidly spread throughout the [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]]. Arabic sources, such as [[Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi|Rhazes]] (Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi 865–925 AD), continue to be the source of discovery of new or relatively inaccessible Galenic writings.<ref name="nuttonchoice"/> As the title, ''Doubts on Galen'' by [[Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi|Rhazes]] implies, as well as the writings of physicians such as [[Ibn Zuhr]] (Avenzoar) and [[Ibn al-Nafis]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reflections Chairman's | year = 2004 | title = Traditional Medicine Among Gulf Arabs, Part II: Blood-letting | url = | journal = Heart Views | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 74–85 [80] }}</ref> the works of Galen were not accepted unquestioningly, but as a challengeable basis for further [[Scientific method|inquiry]].

A strong emphasis on [[experiment]]ation and [[empiricism]] led to new results and new observations, which were contrasted and combined with those of Galen by writers such as [[Rhazes]], [[Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi]] (Haly Abbas), [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]] (Abulasis), [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna), Ibn Zuhr and Ibn al-Nafis. For example, the experiments carried out by Rāzi and Ibn Zuhr contradicted the Galenic theory of humorism,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} while Ibn al-Nafis' discovery of the [[pulmonary circulation]] contradicted the Galenic theory on the heart.<ref name="Dabbagh">{{cite journal | author = Al-Dabbagh S. A. | year = 1978 | title = Ibn Al-Nafis and the pulmonary circulation | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 311 | issue = 8074| page = 1148 }}</ref>

===Reintroduction to the Latin West===
From the 11th century onwards, [[Latin translations of the 12th century|Latin translations of Islamic medical texts]] began to appear in the West, alongside the [[Schola Medica Salernitana|Salerno]] school of thought, and were soon incorporated into the curriculum at the universities of [[Naples University|Naples]] and [[Montpellier University|Montpellier]]. From that time, Galenism took on a new, unquestioned authority, Galen even being referred to as the "Medical Pope of the Middle Ages".<ref name="brock"/> [[Constantine the African]] was amongst those who translated both Hippocrates and Galen from Arabic. In addition to the more numerous translations of Arabic texts in this period, there were a few translations of Galenic works directly from the Greek, such as [[Burgundio of Pisa]]'s translation of ''De complexionibus''. Galen's works on anatomy and medicine became the mainstay of the medieval physician's university curriculum, alongside Ibn Sina's ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' which elaborated on Galen's works. Unlike pagan Rome, Christian Europe did not exercise a universal prohibition of the dissection and autopsy of the human body and such examinations were carried out regularly from at least the 13th century.<ref>P Prioreschi, Determinants of the revival of dissection of the human body in the Middle Ages', Medical Hypotheses (2001) 56(2), 229–234</ref> However, Galen's influence, as in the Arab world, was so great that when dissections discovered anomalies compared with Galen's anatomy, the physicians often tried to fit these into the Galenic system. An example of this is [[Mondino de Liuzzi]], who describes rudimentary blood circulation in his writings but still asserts that the left ventricle should contain air. Some cited these changes as proof that human anatomy had changed since the time of Galen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Raymond F.|title=Stories of Great Physicians|publisher=Whitman|year=1963|pages=46–47|chapter=The Anatomist}}</ref>

The most important translator of Galen's works into Latin was Niccolò di Deoprepio da Reggio, who spent several years working on Galen. Niccolò worked at the Angevin Court during the reign of king [[Robert, King of Naples|Robert of Naples]]. Among Niccolò's translations is a piece from a medical treatise by Galen of which the original text is lost.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Roberto|title=The Dawn of Humanism in Italy|year=1947|publisher=H. K. Lewis & Co. Ltd.|location=London|pages=19}}</ref>

===Renaissance===
The Renaissance and fall of the Byzantine Empire (1453) was accompanied by an influx of Greek scholars and manuscripts to the West, allowing direct comparison between the Arabic commentaries and the original Greek texts of Galen. This [[New Learning]] and the [[Renaissance humanism|Humanist]] movement, particularly the work of [[Thomas Linacre|Linacre]], promoted ''[[literae humaniores]]'' including Galen in the Latin scientific canon, ''De Naturalibus Facultatibus'' appearing in London in 1523. Debates on medical science now had two traditions, the more conservative Arabian and the liberal Greek.<ref name="brock"/> The more extreme liberal movements began to challenge the role of authority in medicine, as exemplified by [[Paracelsus]]' symbolically burning the works of Avicenna and Galen at his medical school in [[University of Basel|Basle]].<ref name="brock"/> Nevertheless Galen's pre-eminence amongst the great thinkers of the millennium is exemplified by a 16th-century mural in the refectory of the [[Great Lavra]] of [[Mt Athos]]. It depicts pagan sages at the foot of the [[Tree of Jesse]], with Galen between the [[Sibyl]] and [[Aristotle]].<ref name="nutton84">[http://www.dahsm.medschool.ucsf.edu/history/IntroCourseIPDF/Nutton_Galen_to_Alex.pdf Nutton V. From Galen to Alexander, aspects of medicine and medical practice in late antiquity. Dunbarton Oaks Papers. 38, 1984]</ref>
[[Image:greek doc01.jpg|thumb|right|Galen. De pulsibus. (Manuscript; Venice, ca. 1550). This Greek manuscript of Galen’s treatise on the pulse is interleaved with a Latin translation.]]

Galenism's final defeat came from a combination of the negativism of Paracelsus and the constructivism of the Italian Renaissance anatomists, such as [[Vesalius]] in the 16th century.<ref name="brock"/> In the 1530s, the Flemish anatomist and physician Andreas Vesalius took on a project to translate many of Galen's Greek texts into Latin. Vesalius' most famous work, ''De humani corporis fabrica'', was greatly influenced by Galenic writing and form. Seeking to examine critically Galen's methods and outlook, Vesalius turned to human cadaver dissection as a means of verification. Galen's writings were shown by Vesalius to describe details present in monkeys but not in humans, and he demonstrated Galen's limitations through books and hands-on demonstrations despite fierce opposition from orthodox pro-Galenists such as [[Jacques Dubois|Jacobus Sylvius]]. Since Galen states that he is using observations of monkeys (human dissection was prohibited) to give an account of what the body looks like, Vesalius could portray himself as using Galen's approach of description of direct observation to create a record of the exact details of the human body, since he worked in a time when human dissection was allowed. Galen argued that monkey anatomy was close enough to humans for physicians to learn anatomy with monkey dissections and then make observations of similar structures in the wounds of their patients, rather than trying to learn anatomy only from wounds in human patients, as would be done by students trained by the Empiricist medical sect would.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cosans C | year = 1997 | title = Galen's Critique of Rationalist and Empiricist Anatomy | url = | journal = Journal of the History of Biology | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 35–54 | doi = 10.1023/A:1004266427468 | pmid = 11618979 }}</ref> The examinations of Vesalius also disproved medical theories of [[Aristotle]] and [[Mondino de Liuzzi]]. One of the best known examples of Vesalius' overturning of Galenism was his demonstration that the [[interventricular septum]] of the heart was not permeable, as Galen had taught (''Nat Fac III xv''). However, this had been revealed two years before by [[Michael Servetus]] in his fateful "''Christianismi restitutio''" (1553).

[[Michael Servetus]], using the name "Michel de Villeneuve" during his stay in France, was [[Vesalius]]' fellow student and the best Galenist at the University of Paris, according to [[Johann Winter von Andernach]],<ref>2011 “The love for truth. Life and work of Michael Servetus”, (El amor a la verdad. Vida y obra de Miguel Servet.), González Echeverría, Francisco Javier, printed by Navarro y Navarro, Zaragoza, collaboration with the Government of Navarra, Department of Institutional Relations and Education of the Government of Navarra, 607 pp, 64 of them illustrations. Note 481(.."''primum Andrea Vesalem..Post hunc,Michael Villanovanus familiariter milhi in consectionibus adhibitus est, vir in omni genere litterarum ornatissimus in Galenic doctrina, vix illi secundus..''" Audrey, Jean</ref> who taught both. In the Galenism of the Renaissance, editions of the ''Opera Omnia'' by Galen were very important. It was begun in Venice in 1541–1542  by the  Guinta. There were fourteen editions of the book from that date until 1625. Just one edition was produced from Lyon between 1548 and 1551. The Lyon edition has commentaries on breathing and blood streaming that correct the work of earlier renowned authors such as [[Vesalius]], [[John Caius|Caius]] or [[Janus Cornarius]]. "Michel De Villeneuve" had contracts with Jean Frellon for that work, and the Servetus scholar-researcher Francisco Javier González Echeverría <ref>2002 “ Michael Servetus in the  'Opera Omnia' of Galenus of 1548–1551 printed by Jean Frellon”, González Echeverría, Francisco Javier.

Another convincing case where understanding of the body was extended beyond where Galen had left it came from these demonstrations of the nature of human circulation and the subsequent work of [[Andrea Cesalpino]], [[Hieronymus Fabricius|Fabricio of Acquapendente]] and [[William Harvey]].<ref name="brock"/> Some Galenic teaching, such as his emphasis on [[bloodletting]] as a remedy for many ailments, however remained influential until well into the 19th century.<ref>Brian, P., 1986, ''Galen on Bloodletting,'' Cambridge University Press</ref>
