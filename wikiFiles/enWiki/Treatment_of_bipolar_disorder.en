The emphasis of the '''treatment of bipolar disorder''' is on effective management of the long-term course of the illness, which can involve treatment of emergent symptoms. Treatment methods include pharmacological and psychological techniques.

==Principles==
The primary treatment for [[bipolar disorder]] consists of [[medication]]s called [[mood stabilizer]]s, which are used to prevent or control episodes of [[mania]] or [[depression (mood)|depression]]. [[Medications]] from several classes have mood stabilizing activity. Many individuals may require a combination of medication to achieve full [[remission (medicine)|remission]] of symptoms.<ref name="Stahl">{{cite book|author= Stahl, S. M. | title=Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology: Neuroscientific basis and practical applications| publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2008}}</ref> As it is impossible to predict which medication will work best for a particular individual, it may take some trial and error to find the best medication or combination for a specific patient. [[Psychotherapy]] also has a role in the treatment of [[bipolar disorder]]. The goal of treatment is not to [[cure]] the disorder but rather to control the [[symptoms]] and the course of the disorder. Generally speaking, maintenance treatment of [[bipolar disorder]] continues long after [[symptom]] control has been achieved.

Following [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic evaluation]], the treating [[clinician]] must determine the optimal treatment setting in order to ensure the patient's safety. Assessment of [[suicide]] risk is key, as the rate of [[suicide]] completion among those with [[bipolar disorder]] may be as high as 10–15%.<ref name="APA guidelines">American Psychiatric Association, [http://psychiatryonline.org/content.aspx?bookid=28&sectionid=1669577 "Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients with Bipolar Disorder, Second Edition"], 2002</ref> [[Inpatient care|Hospitalization]] should be considered in patients whose judgment is significantly impaired by their illness, and those who have not responded to outpatient treatment; this may need to be done on an involuntary basis.<ref name="APA guidelines"/> Treatment setting should regularly be re-evaluated to ensure that it is optimal for the patient's needs.

==Mood stabilizers==

===Lithium salts===
{{Main|Lithium pharmacology}}
The use of [[lithium salt]]s as a treatment of bipolar disorder was first discovered by Dr. [[John Cade]], an Australian psychiatrist who published a paper on the use of lithium in 1949.

[[Lithium salts]] had long been used as a first-line treatment for bipolar disorder. In ancient times, doctors would send their mentally ill patients to drink from "alkali springs" as a treatment. They did not know it, but they were really prescribing lithium, which was present in high concentration in the waters. The therapeutic effect of lithium salts appears to be entirely due to the [[lithium]] ion, Li<sup>+</sup>.

Its exact mechanism of action is uncertain, although there are several possibilities such as inhibition of [[inositol monophosphatase]], modulation of [[G protein]]s or regulation of [[gene expression]] for [[growth factors]] and neuronal plasticity.<ref name="Stahl"/> There is strong evidence for its effectiveness in acute treatment and prevention of recurrence of [[mania]].  It can also be effective in [[bipolar depression]], although the evidence is not as strong.<ref name="Stahl"/> It is also effective in reducing the risk of suicide in patients with mood disorders.<ref name=bald_2003>{{cite journal |pmid=12720484 |year=2003 |last1=Baldessarini |first1=R. J. |last2=Tondo |first2=L. |last3=Hennen |first3=J. |title=Lithium treatment and suicide risk in major affective disorders: Update and new findings |volume=64 Suppl 5 |pages=44–52 |journal=The Journal of clinical psychiatry}}</ref>

Potential side effects from [[Lithium (medication)|lithium]] include [[gastrointestinal]] upset, [[tremor]], [[sedation]], [[excessive thirst]], [[frequent urination]], [[cognitive]] problems, impaired [[motor coordination]], [[hair loss]], and [[acne]].<ref name="APA guidelines"/> Excessive levels of lithium can be harmful to the kidneys, and increase the risk of side effects in general. As a result, [[kidney function]] and [[blood levels]] of lithium are monitored in patients being treated with lithium.<ref name="Stahl"/> Therapeutic plasma levels of lithium range of 0.5–1.5 mEq/L, with levels of 0.8 or higher being desirable in [[acute mania]].<ref name="APP textbook">Hales E. and Yudofsky, J. A., eds, The American Psychiatric Press Textbook of Psychiatry, Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc., 2003</ref> Monitoring is generally more frequent when lithium is being initiated, and the frequency can be decreased once a patient in stabilized on a given dose. [[Thyroid hormone]]s should also be monitored periodically, as lithium can increase the risk of [[hypothyroidism]].<ref name="APA guidelines"/>

===Anticonvulsants===

A number of [[anti-convulsant]] drugs are used as mood stabilizers, and the suspected mechanism is related to the theory that mania can "kindle" further mania, similar to the [[kindling model]] of [[seizures]].<ref name="Stahl"/> [[Valproic acid]], or valproate, was one of the first [[anti-convulsant]]s tested for use in [[bipolar disorder]]. It has proven to be effective for treating [[acute mania]].<ref name="Stahl"/> The mania prevention and antidepressant effects of [[valproic acid]] have not been well demonstrated.<ref name="Stahl"/> [[Valproic acid]] is less effective than [[lithium (medication)|lithium]] at preventing and treating [[depressive episode]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.110.084822 |title=Valproate v. Lithium in the treatment of bipolar disorder in clinical practice: Observational nationwide register-based cohort study |year=2011 |last1=Kessing |first1=L. V. |last2=Hellmund |first2=G. |last3=Geddes |first3=J. R. |last4=Goodwin |first4=G. M. |last5=Andersen |first5=P. K. |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=199 |pages=57–63 |pmid=21593515 |issue=1}}</ref>

[[Carbamazepine]] was the first [[anti-convulsant]] shown to be effective for treating bipolar [[mania]]. It has not been extensively studied in [[bipolar depression]], .<ref name="Stahl"/> It is generally considered a second-line agent due to its side effect profile.<ref name="Stahl"/> [[Lamotrigine]] is considered a first-line agent for the treatment of [[bipolar depression]]. It is effective in preventing the recurrence of both [[mania]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], but it has not proved useful in treating [[acute mania]].<ref name="Stahl"/>

[[Zonisamide]] (trade name Zonegran), another anti-convulsant, also may show promise in treating bipolar depression.<ref>Frederick K. Goodwin M.D. "[http://www.medscape.com/viewprogram/4509 The Accurate Diagnosis and Long-Term Treatment of Bipolar Depression]"</ref> Various other anti-convulsants have been tested in bipolar disorder, but there is little evidence of their effectiveness.<ref name="Stahl"/> Other anti-convulsants effective in some cases and being studied closer include [[phenytoin]], [[levetiracetam]], [[pregabalin]] and [[valnoctamide]].<ref name=kinder_gentler_valproate>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00140179|Valnoctamide in Mania}}</ref>

Each anti-convulsant agent has a unique side-effect profile. [[Valproic acid]] can frequently cause sedation or [[gastrointestinal]] upset, which can be minimized by giving the related drug [[divalproex sodium|divalproex]], which is available in an [[enteric coating|enteric-coated]] tablet.<ref name="Stahl"/> These side effects tend to disappear over time.<ref name="APA guidelines"/> According to studies conducted in [[Finland]] in patients with [[epilepsy]], valproate may increase [[testosterone]] levels in teenage girls and produce [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] in women who began taking the medication before age 20. Increased testosterone can lead to polycystic ovary syndrome with irregular or absent menses, obesity, and abnormal growth of hair. Therefore, young female patients taking valproate should be monitored carefully by a physician. Excessive levels of valproate can lead to impaired liver function, and liver enzymes and serum valproate level, with a target of 50–125 mcg/L, should be monitored periodically.<ref name="APA guidelines"/>

Side effects of [[carbamazepine]] include [[blurred vision]], [[double vision]], [[ataxia]], [[weight gain]], [[nausea]], and [[fatigue]], as well as some rare but serious side effects such as [[blood dyscrasia]]s, [[pancreatitis]], [[exfoliative dermatitis]], and [[hepatic failure]].<ref name="APA guidelines"/> Monitoring of [[liver enzymes]], [[platelets]], and [[blood cell count]]s are recommended.<ref name="APA guidelines"/>

[[Lamotrigine]] generally has minimal side effects, but the dose must be increased slowly to avoid rashes, including [[exfoliative dermatitis]].<ref name=Stahl/>

===Atypical antipsychotic drugs===

Second-generation or [[atypical antipsychotics]] (including [[aripiprazole]], [[olanzapine]], [[quetiapine]], [[paliperidone]], [[risperidone]], and [[ziprasidone]]) have emerged as effective mood stabilizers.<ref name="Stahl"/> The evidence for this is fairly recent, as in 2003 the American Psychiatric Press noted that atypical anti-psychotics should be used as adjuncts to other anti-manic drugs because their mood stabilizing properties had not been well established.<ref name="APP textbook"/> The mechanism is not well known, but may be related to effects on [[glutamate]] activity. Several studies have shown atypical antipsychotics to be effective both as single-agent and adjunctive treatments.<ref name="APA guideline watch">American Psychiatric Association, [http://psychiatryonline.org/content.aspx?bookid=28&sectionid=1682557 "Guideline Watch: Practice Guide for the Treatment of Patients with Bipolar Disorder, 2nd ed"], 2005</ref> [[Antidepressant]] effectiveness varies, which may be related to different [[serotonergic]] and [[dopaminergic]] receptor binding profiles.<ref name="Stahl"/> [[Quetiapine]] and the combination of [[olanzapine]] and [[fluoxetine]] have both demonstrated effectiveness in bipolar depression.<ref name="APA guideline watch"/>

In light of recent evidence, [[olanzapine]] (Zyprexa) has been FDA approved as an effective monotherapy for the maintenance of bipolar disorder.<ref name=Olanzapine_maintenance_therapy>[http://www.zyprexa.com/common_pages/hcp_maintenance.jsp Now Approved: ZYPREXA for maintenance therapy for bipolar disorder.] Official Zyprexa Website.</ref> A head-to-head randomized control trial in 2005 has also shown [[olanzapine]] monotherapy to be just as effective and safe as [[lithium]] in [[prophylaxis]].<ref name=Tohen_et_al_2005>{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.7.1281 |title=Olanzapine Versus Lithium in the Maintenance Treatment of Bipolar Disorder: A 12-Month, Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Clinical Trial |year=2005 |last1=Tohen |first1=M. |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=162 |issue=7 |pages=1281–90 |pmid=15994710 |last2=Greil |first2=W. |last3=Calabrese |first3=J. R. |last4=Sachs |first4=G. S. |last5=Yatham |first5=L. N. |last6=Oerlinghausen |first6=B. M. |last7=Koukopoulos |first7=A. |last8=Cassano |first8=G. B. |last9=Grunze |first9=H.}}</ref>

The [[atypical antipsychotic]]s differ somewhat in side effect profiles, but most have some risk of [[sedation]], [[weight gain]], and [[extrapyramidal symptoms]] (including [[tremor]], [[stiffness]], and [[restlessness]]).<ref name="Stahl"/> They may also increase the risk of [[metabolic syndrome]],<ref name="Stahl"/> so metabolic monitoring should be performed regularly, including checks of serum [[cholesterol]], [[triglycerides]], and [[glucose]], weight, [[blood pressure]], and waist circumference.

===New treatments===
A variety of other agents have been tried in bipolar disorder, including [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[calcium channel blocker]]s, [[L-methylfolate]], and [[thyroid hormone]].<ref name="Stahl"/> [[Modafinil]] (Provigil) and [[Pramipexole]] (Mirapex) show promise in treating cognitive deterioration related to bipolar depression. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In addition [[Riluzole]], an [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] treatment, has been shown to be effective treatment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The [[breast cancer]] medicine [[tamoxifen]] has shown quick response to manic phases.<ref name="pmid17845270">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1399-5618.2007.00530.x |title=Efficacy of a protein kinase C inhibitor (tamoxifen) in the treatment of acute mania: A pilot study |year=2007 |last1=Zarate |first1=Carlos A. |last2=Singh |first2=Jaskaran B. |last3=Carlson |first3=Paul J. |last4=Quiroz |first4=Jorge |last5=Jolkovsky |first5=Libby |last6=Luckenbaugh |first6=David A. |last7=Manji |first7=Husseini K. |journal=Bipolar Disorders |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=561–70 |pmid=17845270}}</ref>

==Antidepressants==

[[Antidepressants]] should only be used with caution in [[bipolar disorder]], as they may not be effective and may even induce [[mania]].<ref name="Stahl"/> They should not be used alone, but may be considered as an adjunct to [[lithium]].<ref name="APA guidelines"/>

A recent large-scale study found that severe depression in patients with bipolar disorder responds no better to a combination of antidepressant medications and mood stabilizers than it does to mood stabilizers alone and that antidepressant use does not hasten the emergence of manic symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder.<ref name=sachs2007>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa064135 |title=Effectiveness of Adjunctive Antidepressant Treatment for Bipolar Depression |year=2007 |last1=Sachs |first1=Gary S. |last2=Nierenberg |first2=Andrew A. |last3=Calabrese |first3=Joseph R. |last4=Marangell |first4=Lauren B. |last5=Wisniewski |first5=Stephen R. |last6=Gyulai |first6=Laszlo |last7=Friedman |first7=Edward S. |last8=Bowden |first8=Charles L. |last9=Fossey |first9=Mark D. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=356 |issue=17 |pages=1711–22 |pmid=17392295}}</ref>

The concurrent use of an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer, instead of mood stabilizer monotherapy, may lower the risk of further bipolar depressive episodes in patients whose most recent depressive episode has been resolved.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.7.1252 |title=Impact of Antidepressant Discontinuation After Acute Bipolar Depression Remission on Rates of Depressive Relapse at 1-Year Follow-Up |year=2003 |last1=Altshuler |first1=L. |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=7 |pages=1252–62 |pmid=12832239 |last2=Suppes |first2=T. |last3=Black |first3=D. |last4=Nolen |first4=W.

A. |last7=McElroy |first7=S. |last8=Kupka |first8=R. |last9=Grunze |first9=H.}}</ref> However, some studies have also found that antidepressants pose a risk of inducing hypomania or mania,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17960960 |year=2007 |last1=Truman |first1=C.

[[Saint John's Wort]], although a naturally occurring compound, is thought to function in a fashion similar to man-made antidepressants, and so unsurprisingly, there are reports that suggest that it can also induce mania.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10624554 |year=1999 |last1=Nierenberg |first1=A. A. |last2=Burt |first2=T. |last3=Matthews |first3=J. |last4=Weiss |first4=A. P. |title=Mania associated with St. John's wort |volume=46 |issue=12 |pages=1707–8 |journal=Biological Psychiatry |doi=10.1016/S0006-3223(99)00233-4}}</ref> For these reasons, some psychiatrists are hesitant to prescribe antidepressants for the treatment of bipolar disorder unless mood stabilizers have failed to have an effect, however, others feel that antidepressants still have an important role to play in treatment of bipolar disorder.

Side effects vary greatly among different classes of antidepressants.

==NMDA-receptor antagonists==

In a [[double-blind]], [[placebo-controlled]], [[proof-of-concept|proof-of-concept study]], researchers administered an N-methyl-d-aspartate–receptor antagonist ([[ketamine]]) to 18 patients already on treatment with [[lithium]] (10 patients) or [[valproate]] (8 patients) for [[bipolar depression]]. From 40 minutes following intravenous injection of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5&nbsp;mg/kg), the researchers observed significant improvements in depressive symptoms, as measured by standard tools, that were maintained for up to 3 days, an effect not observed in subjects who received the placebo.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.90 |title=A Randomized Add-on Trial of an N-methyl-D-aspartate Antagonist in Treatment-Resistant Bipolar Depression |year=2010 |last1=Diazgranados |first1=N. |last2=Ibrahim |first2=L. |last3=Brutsche |first3=N. E. |last4=Newberg |first4=A. |last5=Kronstein |first5=P. |last6=Khalife |first6=S. |last7=Kammerer |first7=W. A. |last8=Quezado |first8=Z. |last9=Luckenbaugh |first9=D. A. |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=67 |issue=8 |pages=793–802 |pmid=20679587 |pmc=3000408}}</ref> Five subjects dropped out of the ketamine study; of these, four were taking valproate and one was being treated with lithium. One patient showed signs of [[hypomania]] following ketamine administration and two experienced low mood. This study demonstrates a rapid-onset antidepressant effect of ketamine in a small group of patients with bipolar depression. The authors acknowledged the study's limitations, including the dissociative disturbances in patients receiving ketamine that could have compromised the study [[blinding]], and they emphasised the need for further research.

A more recent double-blind, placebo-controlled study by the same group found that ketamine treatment resulted in a similarly rapid alleviation of [[suicidal ideation]] in 15 patients with bipolar depression.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zarate |first=C. A. Jr|coauthors=Brutsche, N. E.; Ibrahim, L.; Franco-Chaves, J.; Diazgranados, N.; Cravchik, A.; Selter, J.; Marquardt, C. A.; Liberty, V.; Luckenbaugh, D.

Ketamine is used as a [[dissociative anaesthetic]], and is a [[Class C drug|Class C]] substance in the United Kingdom; as such, it should only be used under the direction of a health professional.

==Dopamine agonists==
In a single controlled study of twenty one patients, the [[dopamine receptor D3|dopamine D<sub>3</sub> receptor]] agonist [[pramipexole]] was found to be highly effective in the treatment of bipolar depression. Treatment was initiated at 0.125&nbsp;mg t.i.d. and increased at a rate of 0.125&nbsp;mg t.i.d. to a limit of 4.5&nbsp;mg qd until the patients' condition satisfactorily responded to the medication or they could not abide the side effects. The final average dosage was 1.7&nbsp;mg ± .90&nbsp;mg qd. The incidence of hypomania in the treatment group was no greater than in the control group.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid = 15219473 | doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2004.03.013 | volume=56 | issue=1 | title=Pramipexole for bipolar II depression: a placebo-controlled proof of concept study | year=2004 | month=July | journal=Biol.

==Psychotherapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy==
{{Main|Psychotherapy}}
Certain types of [[psychotherapy]], used in combination with medication, may provide some benefit in the treatment of bipolar disorders. [[Psychoeducation]] has been shown to be effective in improving patients' compliance with their lithium treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.52.5.873 |title=Preventing medical noncompliance in the outpatient treatment of bipolar affective disorders |year=1984 |last1=Cochran |first1=Susan D. |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=873–8 |pmid=6501672}}</ref> Several studies of [[family therapy]] report it can improve family communication, social functioning and lithium compliance, though it appears to be effective mainly on females.<ref name="parikh">{{cite journal |pmid=9288439 |year=1997 |last1=Parikh |first1=S.

Although medication and psychotherapy cannot cure the illness, therapy can often be valuable in helping to address the effects of disruptive manic or depressive episodes that have hurt a patient's career, relationships or self-esteem. Therapy is available not only from psychiatrists but from social workers, psychologists and other licensed counselors.

==Jungian therapy==
Jungian authors have likened the [[mania]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] of [[bipolar disorder]] to the [[Jungian archetypes]] 'puer' and 'senex'.<ref name="Hillman_a"/><ref name="Hillman">Hillman, J.

==Lifestyle Changes==

===Understanding One's Symptoms===
Understanding the symptoms, when they occur and ways to control them using appropriate medications and psychotherapy has given many people diagnosed with bipolar disorder a chance at a better life. Technically this is called prodrome detection and this is partly what is meant by becoming an expert on one's illness.

===Stress reduction===
Forms of stress may include having too much to do, too much complexity and conflicting demands among others. There are also stresses that come from the absence of elements such as human contact, a sense of achievement, constructive creative outlets, and occasions or circumstances that will naturally elicit positive emotions.
Stress reduction will involve reducing things that cause anxiety and increasing those that generate happiness. It is not enough to just reduce the anxiety.

===Co-morbid substance use disorder===
Co-occurring substance misuse disorders, which are extremely common in bipolar patients can cause a significant worsening of bipolar symptomatology and can cause the emergence of affective symptoms. The treatment options and recommendations for substance use disorders is wide but may include certain pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment options.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1747-597X-2-29 |title=The prevalence and significance of substance use disorders in bipolar type I and II disorder |year=2007 |last1=Cerullo |first1=Michael A. |last2=Strakowski |first2=Stephen M. |journal=Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy |volume=2 |pages=29}}</ref>

==Other Treatments==

===Omega-3 fatty acids===
[[Omega-3 fatty acid]]s may also be used as a treatment for bipolar disorder, particularly as a supplement to medication.  An initial clinical trial by Stoll et al. produced positive results.<ref name=Stoll_1999>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.56.5.407 |title=Omega 3 Fatty Acids in Bipolar Disorder: A Preliminary Double-blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial |year=1999 |last1=Stoll |first1=A. L. |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=407–12 |pmid=10232294 |last2=Severus |first2=W. E. |last3=Freeman |first3=M. P. |last4=Rueter |first4=S. |last5=Zboyan |first5=H. A. |last6=Diamond |first6=E. |last7=Cress |first7=K. K. |last8=Marangell |first8=L. B.}}</ref> However, since 1999 attempts to confirm this finding of beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids in several larger double-blind clinical trials have produced inconclusive results. It was hypothesized that the therapeutic ingredient in omega-3 fatty acid preparations is [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA) and that supplements should be high in this compound to be beneficial.<ref name=epa>{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.v66n0608 |title=Omega-3 Eicosapentaenoic Acid in Bipolar Depression |year=2005 |last1=Osher |first1=Yamima |last2=Bersudsky |first2=Yuly |last3=Belmaker |first3=R. H. |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=726–9 |pmid=15960565}}</ref> Limited results showed that 1.5 to 2 gram EPA/day may reduce depression up to 50%.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15960565</ref>

Omega-3 fatty acids may be found in fish, fish oils, algae, and to a lesser degree in other foods such as flaxseed, flaxseed oil and walnuts. Although the benefits of Omega-3 fatty acids remain debated, they are readily available at drugstores and supermarkets, relatively inexpensive, and have few known side effects. (All of these oils, however, have the capacity to exacerbate GERD—food sources may be a good alternative in such cases.)

===Exercise===
Exercise has also been shown to have antidepressant effects.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reynolds|first=Gretchen|title=Prescribing Exercise to Treat Depression|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/prescribing-exercise-to-treat-depression/|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}</ref>

===Electroconvulsive therapy===
{{Main|Electroconvulsive therapy}}
[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) may have some effectiveness in mixed mania states, and good effectiveness in bipolar depression, particularly in the presence of [[psychosis]].<ref name="APA guidelines"/> It may also be useful in the treatment of mania that is non-responsive to medications.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Small, J. G.; Milstein. V.; Klapper, M. H. et al. | title=Electroconvulsive therapy in the treatment of manic episodes | journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume=426 | year=1986 | pages=37–49 }}</ref>

The most frequent side effects of [[ECT]] include [[memory impairment]], [[headaches]], and [[muscle ache]]s.<ref name="APP textbook"/> In some instances, ECT can produce significant and long-lasting [[cognitive impairment]], including [[anterograde amnesia]], and [[retrograde amnesia]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17653292 |year=2007 |last1=MacQueen |first1=G. |last2=Parkin |first2=C. |last3=Marriott |first3=M. |last4=Bégin |first4=H. |last5=Hasey |first5=G. |title=The long-term impact of treatment with electroconvulsive therapy on discrete memory systems in patients with bipolar disorder |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=241–9 |pmc=1911194 |journal=Journal of psychiatry & neuroscience}}</ref>

===Ketogenic diet===
A [[ketogenic diet]] similar to the diet used for pediatric [[epilepsy]] was thought to have mood stabilizing and antidepressant effects.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1054/mehy.2001.1446 |title=The ketogenic diet may have mood-stabilizing properties |year=2001 |last1=El-Mallakh |first1=R. S. |last2=Paskitti |first2=M. E. |journal=Medical Hypotheses |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=724–6 |pmid=11918434}}</ref> [[Stanford University]] Medical School attempted a study using a ketogenic diet protocol on bipolar patients.<ref>http://psychiatry.stanford.edu/research/bipolar.html{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref> However due to the lack of ability to attract subjects the trial was never started. Studies have shown it to have anti-depressant properties in rats.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Cannabinoids===

While some reports indicate that cannabis can lessen the severity of mania and depression symptoms, others indicate cannabis can trigger mania and has been noted to have "a detrimental and potentially causative role in the development of psychosis."<ref>http://www.pendulum.org/bpnews/archive/001628.html{{Unreliable medical source|date=February 2012}}</ref> However, a recent study noted neurocognitive functioning improved in bipolar patients who used cannabis.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0033291709991620 |title=Opposite relationships between cannabis use and neurocognitive functioning in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia |year=2009 |last1=Ringen |first1=P.
