'''Infective endocarditis''' is a form of [[endocarditis]], or inflammation, of the inner tissue of the heart, such as its valves, caused by infectious agents. The agents are usually bacterial, but other organisms can also be responsible.

The [[heart valve|valves of the heart]] do not receive any dedicated blood supply. As a result, defensive immune mechanisms (such as [[white blood cell]]s) cannot directly reach the valves via the bloodstream. If an organism (such as [[bacterium|bacteria]]) attaches to a valve surface and forms a [[Vegetation (pathology)|vegetation]], the host immune response is blunted. The lack of blood supply to the valves also has implications for treatment, since drugs also have difficulty reaching the infected valve.

Normally, blood flows smoothly through these valves. If they have been damaged - from [[rheumatic fever]], for example - the risk of bacterial attachment is increased.<ref name=Robbins>{{cite book |author=Mitchell RS, Kumar V, Robbins SL, Abbas AK, Fausto N |title=Robbins Basic Pathology |publisher=Saunders/Elsevier |edition= 8th |year=2007 |pages=406–8 |isbn=1-4160-2973-7}}</ref>

==Classification==

===By duration===
Historically, infective endocarditis has been clinically divided into ''acute'' and ''subacute''<ref name=Robbins/> presentations (because untreated patients tended to live longer with the subacute as opposed to the acute form). This classifies both the rate of progression and severity of disease.
* ''[[Subacute bacterial endocarditis]]'' (SBE) is often due to [[streptococci]] of low virulence and mild to moderate illness which progresses slowly over weeks and months and has low propensity to hematogenously seed extracardiac sites.
* ''Acute bacterial endocarditis'' (ABE) is a [[fulminant]] illness over days to weeks, and is more likely due to ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' which has much greater virulence, or disease-producing capacity and frequently causes metastatic infection.<ref name=Robbins/>

This classification is now discouraged, because the ascribed associations (in terms of organism and prognosis) were not strong enough to be relied upon clinically. The terms ''short incubation'' (meaning less than about six weeks), and ''long incubation'' (greater than about six weeks) are preferred.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Morris AM |title=How best to deal with endocarditis |journal=Curr Infect Dis Rep |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=14–22 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16448596 |doi=10.1007/s11908-006-0030-8 |url=}}</ref>

===By culture results===
Infective endocarditis may also be classified as ''culture-positive'' or ''culture-negative''. By far the most common cause of a "culture-negative" endocarditis is prior administration of antibiotics.

Sometimes micro-organisms can take a longer period of time to grow in the culture media, such organisms are said to be ''[[Growth medium|fastidious]]'' because they have demanding growth requirements. Some examples include pathogens like ''[[Aspergillus]]'' species, ''[[Brucella]]'' species, ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', ''[[Chlamydia (bacterium)|Chlamydia]]'' species, and [[HACEK organism|HACEK bacteria]]. Due to delay in growth and identification in these cases, patients may be erroneously classified as "culture-negative" endocarditis.

===By heart side===
Endocarditis can also be classified by the side of the heart affected:
* Patients who inject [[narcotics]] or other drugs intravenously may introduce infection which will travel to the right side of the heart classically affecting the [[tricuspid valve]], and most often caused by ''S. aureus''.<ref name=Robbins/>
* In other patients without a history of intravenous exposure, endocarditis is more frequently left-sided.<ref name=Robbins/>

===By infection setting===
Another form of endocarditis is healthcare associated endocarditis when the infecting organism is believed to be transmitted in a health care setting like hospital, dialysis unit or a residential nursing home. [[Nosocomial]] endocarditis is a form of healthcare associated endocarditis in which the infective organism is acquired during stay in a hospital and it is usually secondary to presence of intravenous catheters, [[Total parenteral nutrition]] lines, [[pacemakers]], etc.<ref name=Harrison>{{cite book | author= Kasper DL, Brunwald E, [[Anthony Fauci|Fauci AS]], Hauser S, Longo DL, Jameson JL| title = [[Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine]] | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | year = 2005 | pages = 731–40 | month = May | isbn = 0-07-139140-1 | oclc = 54501403 56437106 56801936 56967424 }}</ref>

===By valve type===
Finally, the distinction between ''native-valve endocarditis'' and ''prosthetic-valve endocarditis'' is clinically important. Prosthetic valve endocarditis can be early (< 60 days of valvular surgery), intermediate (60 days to 1 year) or late (> 1 year following valvular surgery).
* Early prosthetic valve endocarditis is usually due to intraoperative contamination or a postoperative bacterial contamination which is usually [[nosocomial]] in nature.
* Late prosthetic valve endocarditis is usually due to community acquired [[microorganisms]].<ref name=Harrison/>

==Signs and symptoms==
* [[Fever]] occurs in 97% of people; [[malaise]] and endurance [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] in 90% of people.<ref name=Amal2007>{{cite book |author=Amal Mattu; Deepi Goyal; Barrett, Jeffrey W.; Joshua Broder; DeAngelis, Michael; Peter Deblieux; Gus M.

* A new or changing [[heart murmur]], weight loss, and coughing occurs in 35% of people.<ref name=Amal2007/>
* Vascular phenomena: [[septic embolism]] (causing thromboembolic problems such as [[stroke]] in the [[parietal lobe]] of the [[Human brain|brain]] or [[gangrene]] of fingers), [[Janeway lesion]]s (painless hemorrhagic cutaneous lesions on the palms and soles), intracranial hemorrhage, [[conjunctiva]]l hemorrhage, [[splinter hemorrhage]]s, renal infarcts, and splenic infarcts.
* Immunologic phenomena: [[Glomerulonephritis]] which allows for blood and albumin to enter the urine,<ref name=Robbins/> [[Osler's node]]s (painful subcutaneous [[lesions]] in the distal fingers), [[Roth's spot]]s on the [[retina]], positive serum [[rheumatoid factor]]
* Other signs may include; night sweats, rigors, anemia, splenomegaly

A common mnemonic for the signs and symptoms of endocarditis is FROM JANE:
* [[Fever]]
* [[Roth's spots]]
* [[Osler's nodes]]
* [[Murmur]]
* [[Janeway lesions]]
* [[Anemia]]
* Nail hemorrhage ([[splinter hemorrhage]]s)
* [[Emboli]]

==Cause==
In a healthy individual, a [[bacteremia]] (where bacteria get into the blood stream through a minor cut or wound) would normally be cleared quickly with no adverse consequences. If a heart valve is damaged and covered with a piece of blood clot, the valve provides a place for the bacteria to attach themselves and an infection can be established.

In the past, bacteremia caused by [[dentistry|dental]] procedures (in most cases due to [[Streptococcus viridans|streptococci viridans]], which reside in oral cavity), such as a cleaning or [[Extraction (dental)|extraction]] of a [[tooth]] was thought to be more clinically significant than it actually was. However, it is important that a [[dentist]] or a [[dental hygienist]] be told of any heart problems before commencing treatment. [[Antibiotics]] are administered to patients with certain heart conditions as a precaution, although this practice has changed in the US, with new American Heart Association [[Dental antibiotic prophylaxis|guidelines]] released in 2007,<ref name="AHA_2007">{{cite journal |author=Wilson W, Taubert KA, Gewitz M, ''et al.'' |title=Prevention of infective endocarditis: guidelines from the American Heart Association |journal=Circulation |volume=116 |issue=15 |pages=1736–54 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17446442 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.183095 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17446442}}</ref> and in the UK as of March 2008 due to new NICE guidelines. Everyday tooth brushing and flossing will similarly cause bacteremia. Although there is little evidence to support antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment, the current [[American Heart Association]] guidelines are highly accepted by clinicians<ref name="dental">{{cite journal |author=Zadik Y, Findler M, Livne S, ''et al.'' |title=Dentists' knowledge and implementation of the 2007 American Heart Association guidelines for prevention of infective endocarditis |journal=Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod |volume=106 |issue=6 |pages=e16–9 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19000604 |url=http://www.ooooe.net/article/S1079-2104(08)00597-0/abstract |doi=10.1016/j.tripleo.2008.08.009}}</ref> and patients.<ref name="survey">{{cite journal |author=Elad S, Binenfeld-Alon E, Zadik Y, Aharoni M, Findler M. |title=Survey of acceptance of the 2007 American Heart Association guidelines for the prevention of infective endocarditis: a pilot study|journal=Quintessence Int |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=243–51 |year=2011 |month=March |pmid=21465012 |url=http://www.quintpub.com/journals/qi/abstract.php?iss2_id=919&article_id=10528&article=9&title=Survey of acceptance of the 2007 American Heart Association Guidelines for the prevention of infective endocarditis: A pilot study}}</ref>

Other conditions that result in high number of bacteria entering into the bloodstream include [[Colorectal cancer]] (mostly ''[[Streptococcus bovis]]''),<ref name=Gold2004>{{cite journal|last=Gold|first=JS|coauthors=Bayar, S, Salem, RR|title=Association of Streptococcus bovis bacteremia with colonic neoplasia and extracolonic malignancy|journal=Archives of surgery (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)|date=2004 Jul|volume=139|issue=7|pages=760–5|pmid=15249410|doi=10.1001/archsurg.139.7.760}}</ref> serious [[urinary tract infection]]s (mostly [[enterococci]]), and [[drug injection]] (''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''). With a large number of bacteria, even a normal heart valve may become infected.

A more virulent organism (such as ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'') can cause infective endocarditis by infecting even a normal heart valve.

Intravenous drug users tend to get their right-sided heart valves infected because the [[vein]]s that are injected drain into the right side of the heart. In rheumatic heart disease, infection occurs on the aortic and the mitral valves on the left side of the heart.

Other factors that increase the risk of developing infective endocarditis are [[Neutropenia|low levels of white blood cells]], immunodeficiency or immunosuppression, malignancy, [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], and alcohol abuse.<ref name=Robbins/>

==Pathogenesis==
As previously mentioned, altered blood flow around the valves contributes to development of endocarditis. The valves may be damaged congenitally, from [[surgery]], by [[auto-immune]] mechanisms, or simply as a consequence of old age. The damaged part of a heart valve leads to formation of a local blood clot, a condition known as non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). Altered blood flow, and thus infective endocarditis, are more likely in high pressure areas. Consequently, ventricular septal defects create more susceptibility than atrial septal defects. Damaged vascular endothelium will also promote platelet and fibrin deposition, upon which bacteria can take hold. Valvular lesions are a major cause of such damage, as are jet lesions resulting from [[ventricular septal defect]]s or [[patent ductus arteriosus]].

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Endocarditis ultrasound.gif|thumb|Vegetation on the [[tricuspid valve]] by [[echocardiography]]. Arrow denotes the vegetation.]]

In general, a patient should fulfill the Duke criteria in order to establish the diagnosis of endocarditis.<ref name=Durack>{{cite journal | author = Durack D, Lukes A, Bright D | title = New criteria for diagnosis of infective endocarditis: utilization of specific echocardiographic findings.

As the Duke criteria rely heavily on the results of echocardiography, research has addressed when to order an [[echocardiogram]] by using signs and symptoms to predict occult endocarditis among patients with intravenous drug abuse<ref name=Weisse>{{cite journal | author = Weisse A, Heller D, Schimenti R, Montgomery R, Kapila R | title = The febrile parenteral drug user: a prospective study in 121 patients | journal = Am J Med | volume = 94 | issue = 3 | pages = 274–80 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8452151 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(93)90059-X}}</ref><ref name=Samet>{{cite journal | author = Samet J, Shevitz A, Fowle J, Singer D | title = Hospitalization decision in febrile intravenous drug users | journal = Am J Med | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 53–7 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2368794 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(90)90098-X }}</ref><ref name=Marantz>{{cite journal | author = Marantz P, Linzer M, Feiner C, Feinstein S, Kozin A, Friedland G | title = Inability to predict diagnosis in febrile intravenous drug abusers | journal = Ann Intern Med | volume = 106 | issue = 6 | pages = 823–8 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3579068}}</ref> and among non drug-abusing patients.<ref name=Leibovici>{{cite journal | author = Leibovici L, Cohen O, Wysenbeek A | title = Occult bacterial infection in adults with unexplained fever.

'''Among patients who do not use intravenous drugs and have a fever in the emergency room''', there is a less than 5% chance of occult endocarditis. Mellors in 1987 found no cases of endocarditis nor of staphylococcal bacteremia among 135 febrile patients ''in the emergency room''.<ref name=Mellors/> The upper [[confidence interval]] for 0% of 135 is 5%, so for statistical reasons alone, there is up to a 5% chance of endocarditis among these patients. In contrast, Leibovici found that among 113 non-selected adults ''admitted to the hospital'' because of fever there were two cases (1.8% with 95%CI: 0% to 7%) of endocarditis.<ref name=Leibovici/>

'''Among patients who do use intravenous drugs and have a fever in the emergency room''', there is about a 10% to 15% prevalence of endocarditis. This estimate is not substantially changed by whether the doctor believes the patient has a trivial explanation for their fever.<ref name = Marantz/> Weisse found that 13% of 121 patients had endocarditis.<ref name=Weisse/> Marantz also found a prevalence of endocarditis of 13% among such patients in the emergency room with fever.<ref name=Marantz/> Samet found a 6% incidence among 283 such patients, but after excluding patients with initially apparent major illness to explain the fever (including 11 cases of manifest endocarditis), there was a 7% prevalence of endocarditis.<ref name=Samet/>

'''Among patients with staphylococcal bacteremia (SAB)''', one study found a 29% prevalence of endocarditis in community-acquired SAB versus 5% in nosocomial SAB.<ref name=Kaech>{{cite journal | author = Kaech C, Elzi L, Sendi P, ''et al.'' | title = Course and outcome of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia: a retrospective analysis of 308 episodes in a Swiss tertiary-care centre | journal = Clin Microbiol Infect | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 345–52 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16524411 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2005.01359.x}}</ref> However, only 2% of strains were resistant to methicillin and so these numbers may be low in areas of higher resistance.

The transthoracic echocardiogram has a sensitivity and specificity of approximately 65% and 95% if the echocardiographer believes there is 'probable' or 'almost certain' evidence of endocarditis.<ref name=Shively>{{cite journal | author = Shively B, Gurule F, Roldan C, Leggett J, Schiller N | title = Diagnostic value of transesophageal compared with transthoracic echocardiography in infective endocarditis | journal = J Am Coll Cardiol | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 391–7 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1856406 | doi = 10.1016/0735-1097(91)90591-V}}</ref><ref name=Erbel>{{cite journal | author = Erbel R, Rohmann S, Drexler M, ''et al.'' | title = Improved diagnostic value of echocardiography in patients with infective endocarditis by transoesophageal approach.

===Modified Duke criteria===
Established in 1994 by the Duke Endocarditis Service and revised in 2000, the Duke criteria is a collection of major and minor criteria used to establish a diagnosis of endocarditis.<ref name="Durack"/><ref name="Li2000">{{cite pmid|10770721}}</ref> A definite diagnosis of infective endocarditis can be established if the following conditions are fulfilled: two major criteria, one major and three minor criteria, or five minor criteria. Diagnosis of infective endocarditis can only be said to be "possible" if only 1 major and 1 minor criteria are fulfilled or if only 3 minor criteria are fulfilled.

Major criteria include:
# Positive blood culture with typical IE microorganism, defined as one of the following:
#* Typical microorganism consistent with IE from 2 separate blood cultures, as noted below:
#** [[Streptococcus viridans|Viridans-group streptococci]], or
#** ''[[Streptococcus bovis]]'' including nutritional variant strains, or
#** [[HACEK]] group, or
#** ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', or
#** Community-acquired ''[[Enterococci]]'', in the absence of a primary focus
#* Microorganisms consistent with IE from persistently positive blood cultures defined as:
#** Two positive cultures of blood samples drawn >12 hours apart, or
#** All of 3 or a majority of 4 separate cultures of blood (with first and last sample drawn 1 hour apart)
#** ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'' detected by at least one positive blood culture or antiphase I IgG antibody titer >1:800
# Evidence of endocardial involvement with positive echocardiogram defined as
#* Oscillating intracardiac mass on valve or supporting structures, in the path of regurgitant jets, or on implanted material in the absence of an alternative anatomic explanation, or
#* Abscess, or
#* New partial dehiscence of prosthetic valve or new valvular regurgitation (worsening or changing of preexisting murmur not sufficient)

Minor criteria include:
# Predisposing factor: known cardiac lesion, recreational [[drug injection]]
# Fever >38°C
# Evidence of [[embolism]]: arterial emboli, [[pulmonary infarct]]s, [[Janeway lesions]], [[conjunctival hemorrhage]]
# Immunological problems: [[glomerulonephritis]], [[Osler's nodes]]
# Positive blood culture (that doesn't meet a major criterion) or serologic evidence of infection with organism consistent with IE but not satisfying major criterion
# <s>Positive echocardiogram (that doesn't meet a major criterion)</s> (this criterion has been removed from the modified Duke criteria)

==Micro-organisms responsible==
Many microorganisms can cause infective endocarditis. These are generally isolated by [[blood culture]], where the patient's blood is removed, and any growth is noted and identified. The term bacterial endocarditis (BE) commonly is used, reflecting the fact that most cases of IE are due to bacteria; however, Infective Endocarditis (IE) has become the preferred term.

===Bacterial===
''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' followed by ''[[Streptococci]]'' of the viridans group and [[Staphylococcus|Coagulase negative Staphylococci]] are the three most common organisms responsible for infective endocarditis. Other ''[[Streptococcus|Streptococci]]'' and ''[[Enterococcus|Enterococci]]'' are also a frequent cause of infective endocarditis. [[HACEK]] group of micro-organisms and [[Fungi]] are seen less frequently.<ref name=Murdoch>{{cite journal|last=Murdoch|first=DR|coauthors=et. al.|title=Clinical presentation, etiology, and outcome of infective endocarditis in the 21st century: the International Collaboration on Endocarditis-Prospective Cohort Study|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|date=9|year=2009|month=March|volume=169|issue=5|pages=463–73|pmid=19273776|doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2008.603}}</ref>

[[Streptococcus viridans|Viridans]] [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|Alpha-hemolytic]] ''[[Streptococcus|streptococci]]'', that are present in the mouth are the most frequently isolated micro-organisms when the infection is acquired in a community setting. In contrast, ''[[Staphylococcal|Staphylococcus]]'' blood stream infections are frequently acquired in a health care setting where they can enter the blood stream through procedures that cause break in the integrity of skin like surgery, catheterisation or during access of long term indwelling catheters or secondary to intravenous injection of recreational drugs.

''[[Enterococci|Enterococcus]]'' can enter the bloodstream as a consequence of abnormalities in the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts.

Some organisms, when isolated, give valuable clues to the cause, as they tend to be specific.
* ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' species, which are very resilient organisms that thrive in water, may contaminate street drugs that have been contaminated with drinking water. ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa|P. aeruginosa]]'' can infect a child through foot punctures, and can cause both endocarditis and [[septic arthritis]].<ref>[http://wordnet.com.au/Products/topics_in_infectious_diseases_Aug01.htm Topics in Infectious Diseases Newsletter, August 2001, Pseudomonas aeruginosa.]</ref>
* ''[[Streptococcus bovis|S. bovis]]'' and ''[[Clostridium septicum]]'', which are part of the natural flora of the bowel, are associated with [[colon cancer|colonic malignancies]]. When they present as the causative agent in endocarditis, it usually call for a concomitant [[colonoscopy]] due to concerns regarding hematogenous spread of bacteria from the colon due to the neoplasm breaking down the barrier between the gut lumen and the blood vessels which drain the bowel.<ref name="Gold2004" /><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1046/j.1445-1433.2001.02231.x|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1445-1433.2001.02231.x?cookieSet=1&journalCode=ans|title=Clostridium septicum and malignancy |author=Chew SSB, Lubowski DZ|year=2001|journal=ANZ Journal of Surgery |volume=71 |issue=11 |pages= 647–649|pmid=11736823}}</ref>

* Less commonly reported etiological bacteria are responsible for so called "culture negative endocarditis". Such bacteria can be identified by serology, culture of the excised valve tissue, sputum, pleural fluid, and emboli; and by polymerase chain reaction or and sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA.

===Fungal and Viral===
''[[Candida albicans]]'', a [[yeast]], is associated with endocarditis in IV drug users and [[immunocompromised]] patients. Other fungi demonstrated to cause endocarditis are ''[[Histoplasma capsulatum]]'' and [[Aspergillus]].<ref name=Lamas/> Endocarditis with ''Tricosporon asahii'' has also been reported in a case report.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Izumi|first=K|coauthors=et. al.|title=A rare case of infective endocarditis complicated by Trichosporon asahii fungemia treated by surgery.|journal=Annals of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery|year=2009|month=October|volume=15|issue=5|pages=350–353|pmid=19901894}}</ref>

==Treatment==
High dose [[antibiotic]]s are administered by the intravenous route to maximize diffusion of antibiotic molecules into vegetation(s) from the blood filling the chambers of the heart. This is necessary because neither the heart valves nor the vegetations adherent to them are supplied by blood vessels. Antibiotics are continued for a long time, typically two to six weeks depending on the characteristics of the infection and the causative micro-organisms.

In acute endocarditis, due to the fulminant inflammation empirical antibiotic therapy is started immediately after the blood has been drawn for culture. This usually includes [[vancomycin]] and [[ceftriaxone]] IV infusions until the microbial identification and susceptibility report with the [[minimum inhibitory concentration]] becomes available allowing for modification of the antimicrobial therapy to target the specific [[microorganism]]. It should be noted that the routine use of gentamicin to treat endocarditis has fallen out of favor due to the lack of evidence to support its use (except in infections caused by ''[[Enterococcus]]'' and nutritionally variant ''[[streptococci]]'') and the high rate of complications.<ref>{{cite journal

In subacute endocarditis, where patient's hemodynamic status is usually stable, [[antibiotic]] treatment can be delayed till the causative [[microorganism]] can be identified.

The most common organism responsible for infective endocarditis is ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'',<ref name=Murdoch/> which is resistant to [[penicillin]] in most cases. High rates of resistant to [[oxacillin]] are also seen, in which cases treatment with [[vancomycin]] is required.

Viridans group ''[[streptococci]]'' and ''[[Streptococcus bovis]]'' are usually highly susceptible to penicillin and can be treated with [[penicillin]] or [[ceftriaxone]].<ref name=Baddour>{{cite journal|last=Baddour|first=LM|coauthors=et. al.|title=Infective Endocarditis Diagnosis, Antimicrobial Therapy, and Management of Complications: A Statement for Healthcare Professionals From the Committee on Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease, Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young, and the Councils on Clinical Cardiology, Stroke, and Cardiovascular Surgery and Anesthesia, American Heart Association: Endorsed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America|journal=Circulation|date=14|year=2005|month=June|volume=111|issue=23|pages=e394-e434|doi=10.1161/|pmid=15956145}}</ref>

Relatively resistant strains of [[viridans streptococci|viridans group ''streptococci'']] and ''[[Streptococcus bovis]]'' are treated with [[penicillin]] or [[ceftriaxone]] along with a shorter 2 week course of an [[aminoglycoside]] during the initial phase of treatment.<ref name=Baddour/>

Highly [[penicillin]] resistant strains of viridans group ''[[streptococci]]'', nutritionally variant ''[[streptococci]]'' like ''[[Granulicatella]] sp.'', ''[[Gemella]] sp.'' and ''[[Abiotrophia]] defectiva'', and ''[[Enterococci]]'' are usually treated with a combination therapy consisting of [[penicillin]] and an [[aminoglycoside]] for the entire duration of 4–6 weeks.<ref name=Baddour/>

Selected patients may be treated with a relatively shorter course of treatment<ref name=Baddour/> (2 weeks) with benzyl [[penicillin]] IV if infection is caused by viridans goup ''[[streptococci]]'' or ''[[Streptococcus bovis]]'' as long as the following conditions are met:

‣ Endocarditis of a native valve, not of a prosthetic valve

‣ An [[minimum inhibitory concentration|MIC]] ≤ 0.12&nbsp;mg/l

‣ complication such as [[heart failure]], [[arrhythmia]], and pulmonary embolism occure 

‣ No evidence of extracardiac complication like septic [[thromboembolism]]

‣ No vegetations > 5mm in diameter |conduction defects]]

‣ Rapid clinical response and clearance of blood stream infection

Additionally [[oxacillin]] susceptible ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' native valve endocarditis of the right side can also be treated with a short 2 week course of beta lactam [[antibiotic]] like [[nafcillin]] with or without [[aminoglycosides]]

Surgical debridement of infected material and replacement of the valve with a mechanical or bioprosthetic [[artificial heart valve]] is necessary in certain situations:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bonow|first=RO|coauthors=et. al.|title=2008 focused update incorporated into the ACC/AHA 2006 guidelines for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Writing Committee to revise the 1998 guidelines for the management of patients with valvular heart disease).

‣ Patients with significant valve stenosis or regurgitation causing heart failure

‣ Evidence of hemodynamic compromise in the form of elevated end diastolic left ventricular or left atrial pressure or moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension

‣ Presence of intracardiac complications like paravalvular abscess, conduction defects or destructive penetrating lesions

‣ Recurrent septic [[emboli]] despite appropriate antibiotic treatment

‣ Large vegetations (> 10&nbsp;mm)

‣ Persistent positive blood cultures despite appropriate antibiotic treatment

‣ Prosthetic valve dehiscence

‣ Relapsing infection in the presence of a prosthetic valve

‣ Abscess formation

‣ Early closure of mitral valve

‣ Infection caused by Fungi or resistant Gram negative bacteria

Infective endocarditis is associated with 18% in-hospital mortality.<ref name=Murdoch/>

==Antibiotic Prophylaxis==
Not all patients with heart disease require antibiotics to prevent infective endocarditis. Heart diseases have been classified into high, medium and low risk of developing IE. Those falling into high risk category require IE prophylaxis before dental procedures, endoscopies and urinary tract procedures.
Diseases listed under high risk include
# Prior Endocarditis
# Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart diseases
# Completely repaired congenital heart disease in their first 6 months
# Prosthetic heart valves
# Incompletely repaired congenital heart diseases
# Cardiac transplant valvulopathy
Following are the antibiotic regimens recommended by the American Heart Association for antibiotic prophylaxis:<ref name="AHA_2007"/>
: Oral 2g Amoxicillin 1 hour before the procedure
: Intravenous/Intramuscular Ampicillin 2g 1 hour before the procedure
:In patients allergic to penicillins
:: Azithromycin/Clarithromycin 500&nbsp;mg orally 1 hour before the procedure
:: Cephalexin 2g orally 1 hour before the procedure
:: Clindamycin 600&nbsp;mg orally 1 hour before the procedure

In the UK, NICE clinical guidelines no longer advise prophylaxis because there is no clinical evidence that it reduces the incidence of IE and there are negative effects (e.g. allergy and increased bacterial resistance) of taking antibiotics that may outweigh the benefits.<ref name="NICE_CG64">{{cite web | url=http://publications.nice.org.uk/prophylaxis-against-infective-endocarditis-cg64 | title=Prophylaxis against infective endocarditis: Antimicrobial prophylaxis against infective endocarditis in adults and children undergoing interventional procedures | publisher=National Institute for Health Care and Excellence (UK) | work=NICE Clinical Guidelines | date=March 2008 | accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref>
