'''Hypothyroidism''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|aɪ|p|ɵ|ˈ|θ|aɪr|ɔɪ|d|ɪ|z|əm}} is a state in which the [[thyroid gland]] does not make enough [[thyroid hormone]].

[[Iodine deficiency]] is often cited as the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide but it can be caused by many other factors. It can result from the lack of a thyroid gland or from [[iodine-131]] treatment, and can also be associated with increased [[stress (biology)|stress]]. Severe hypothyroidism in [[infants]] can result in [[cretinism]].

A 2011 study concluded that about 8% of women over 50 and men over 65 in the UK suffer from an under-active thyroid and that as many as 100,000 of these people could benefit from treatment they are currently not receiving.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12252813 | work=BBC News | title=100,000 Older People Missing Thyroid Treatment – Study | date=2011-01-24}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Early hypothyroidism is often asymptomatic and can have very mild symptoms. ''Subclinical hypothyroidism'' is a state of normal [[thyroid hormone]] levels, [[thyroxine]] (T4) and [[triiodothyronine]] (T3), with mild elevation of thyrotropin, [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH). With higher TSH levels and low free T4 levels, symptoms become more readily apparent in ''clinical'' (or overt) ''hypothyroidism''.

Hypothyroidism can be associated with the following symptoms:<ref>{{harvnb|ATA|2003|p=4}}</ref><ref name=nlm>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000367|Hypothyroidism – primary}} – see list of Symptoms</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/hypothyroidism/print.html |title=Hypothyroidism – In-Depth Report |publisher=New York Times|year=2008 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref>

===Subclinical hypothyroidism===
Subclinical hypothyroidism occurs when thyroid stimulating hormone(TSH) levels are elevated but thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) and triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) levels are normal.<ref name="Auburn University">{{cite book |author=Jack DeRuiter |title=Endocrine Module (PYPP 5260) |chapter=Thyroid pathology |chapterurl=http://www.auburn.edu/~deruija/endp_thyroidpathol.pdf |format=PDF |year=2002 |page=30 |publisher=Auburn University School of Pharmacy}}</ref> In primary hypothyroidism, TSH levels are high and T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> levels are low.  TSH usually increases when T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> levels drop.  TSH prompts the thyroid gland to make more hormone.  In subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH is elevated but below the limit representing overt hypothyroidism. The levels of the active hormones will be within the laboratory reference ranges.

==Pregnancy and fertility==
{{main|Thyroid disease in pregnancy}}
During [[pregnancy]] there is a substantially increased need of thyroid hormones and substantial risk that a previously unnoticed, subclinical or latent hypothyroidism will turn into overt hypothyroidism.

Subclinical hypothyroidism in early [[pregnancy]], compared with normal thyroid function, has been estimated to increase the risk of [[pre-eclampsia]] with an [[odds ratio]] (OR) of 1.7 and the risk of [[perinatal mortality]] with an OR of 2.7.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmr024}}</ref>

Even mild or subclinical hypothyroidism is known to adversely affect fertility.

==Epidemiology==
0.3% of the general American population have overt hypothyroidism, and 4.3% have subclinical hypothyroidism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hollowell JG, Staehling NW, Flanders WD, ''et al.'' |title=Serum TSH, T(4), and thyroid antibodies in the United States population (1988 to 1994): National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) |journal=J.

==Causes==
[[Iodine deficiency]] is the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide.<ref name="causes"/><ref name="Approaches">{{cite journal |last1=Chakera|first1=AJ|last2=Pearce|first2=SH|last3=Vaidya|first3=B|title=Treatment for primary hypothyroidism: current approaches and future possibilities. |journal=Drug design, development and therapy |volume=6|issue= |pages=1–11 |year=2012 |month=|pmid=22291465|doi=10.2147/DDDT.S12894 }}</ref> In iodine-replete individuals hypothyroidism is frequently caused by [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]],<ref name="Approaches"/><ref name="pregnant">{{cite journal |last1=Gaberscek|first1=S|last2=Zaletel|first2=K|title=Thyroid physiology and autoimmunity in pregnancy and after delivery. |journal=Expert review of clinical immunology |volume=7|issue=5 |pages=697–706 |year=2011 |month=September |pmid=21895480|doi=10.1586/eci.11.42 }}</ref> or otherwise as a result of either an absent [[thyroid]] gland or a deficiency in stimulating hormones from the [[hypothalamus]] or [[pituitary]].

Exposure to [[iodine-131]] from [[nuclear fallout]], which is chemically indistinguishable from [[Radioactivity|non-radioactive]] [[isotope]]s and taken up by the thyroid gland with them, destroys thyroid cells and increases the risk of hypothyroidism.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

[[Congenital hypothyroidism]] is very rare, accounting for approximately 0.2% of cases, and can have several causes such as thyroid aplasia or defects in the hormone metabolism. Thyroid hormone insensitivity (most often T3 receptor defect) also falls into this category, although in this condition levels of thyroid hormones may be normal or even markedly elevated.

Hypothyroidism can result from [[postpartum thyroiditis]] up to 9 months after giving birth, characterized by transient hyperthyroidism followed by transient hypothyroidism. The syndrome is seen in 5 to 9% of women.  The first phase is typically [[hyperthyroidism]]; the thyroid then either returns to normal, or a woman develops hypothyroidism. Of those women who experience hypothyroidism associated with postpartum thyroiditis, 25 to 30% will develop permanent hypothyroidism requiring lifelong thyroxin replacement therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lazarus JH, Parkes AB, Premawardhana LD |title=Postpartum thyroiditis |journal=Autoimmunity |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=169–73 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=12389641 }}</ref> 

Hypothyroidism can result from [[de Quervain's thyroiditis]], which, in turn, is often caused by having bad case of [[flu]] that infects and destroys part, or all, of the [[thyroid]].<ref>[http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/dept/thyroid/thyroiditis.html Thyroiditis] from Columbia University Medical Center, Department of Surgery, New York, NY. Retrieved Mars 2011</ref>

Hypothyroidism can also result from sporadic inheritance, sometimes [[autosome|autosomal]] recessive.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Temporary hypothyroidism can be due to the [[Wolff-Chaikoff effect]].  A very high intake of iodine can be used to temporarily treat hyperthyroidism, especially in an emergency situation.  Although iodide is a substrate for thyroid hormones, high levels reduce iodide [[organification]] in the thyroid gland, decreasing hormone production.  The [[antiarrhythmic agent]] [[amiodarone]] can cause hyper- or hypothyroidism due to its high iodine content.

Hypothyroidism can be caused by [[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]]-based [[mood stabilizer]]s, usually used to treat [[bipolar disorder]] (previously known as manic depression).<ref name="causes" /> In fact, lithium has occasionally been used to treat hyperthyroidism.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Offermanns |first1=Stefan |last2=Rosenthal|first2=Walter|title=Encyclopedia of Molecular Pharmacology, Volume 1 |edition=2nd |year=2008 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-38916-3 |page=189 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=iwwo5gx8aX8C&pg=PA189&dq=propylthiouracil+1940s&q}}</ref>  Other drugs that may produce hypothyroidism include [[interferon alpha]], [[interleukin-2]], and [[thalidomide]].<ref name="causes" />

===Stress and hypothyroidism===
[[Stress (biology)|Stress]] is known to be a significant contributor to thyroid dysfunction; this can be environmental stress as well as lesser-considered homeostatic stress such as fluctuating blood sugar levels and immune problems.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  Stress's effect on thyroid function can be indirect, through its effects on blood sugar levels ([[dysglycemia]]),<ref>{{cite journal |pages=179–83 |doi=10.1002/jnr.490180125 |title=Central action of interleukin-1 in altering the release of tsh, growth hormone, and prolactin in the male rat |year=1987 |last1=Rettori |first1=V. |last2=Jurcovicova |first2=J. |last3=McCann |first3=S.

==Diagnosis==
{{main|Thyroid function tests}}
The only validated test to diagnose primary hypothyroidism, is to measure [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.b725 |title=Diagnosis and treatment of primary hypothyroidism |year=2009 |last1=Allahabadia |first1=A. |last2=Razvi |first2=S. |last3=Abraham |first3=P. |last4=Franklyn |first4=J. |journal=BMJ |volume=338 |pages=b725 |pmid=19325179}}</ref>  However, these levels can be affected by non-thyroidal illnesses.

High levels of TSH indicate that the thyroid is not producing sufficient levels of [[thyroid hormone]] (mainly as [[thyroxine]] (T<sub>4</sub>) and smaller amounts of triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>)). However, measuring just TSH fails to diagnose secondary and tertiary hypothyroidism, thus leading to the following suggested blood testing if the TSH is normal and hypothyroidism is still suspected:

* Free triiodothyronine (fT<sub>3</sub>)
* Free [[thyroxine]] (fT<sub>4</sub>)
* Total T<sub>3</sub>
* Total T<sub>4</sub>

Additionally, the following measurements may be needed:

* Free T<sub>3</sub> from 24-hour urine catch<ref name="24hurine">{{cite journal |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=105–13 |month=June |year=2000 |doi=10.1080/13590840050043521 |title=Thyroid Insufficiency. Is TSH Measurement the Only Diagnostic Tool? |last1=Baisier |first1=W. V. |last2=Hertoghe |first2=J. |last3=Eeckhaut |first3=W. |journal=Journal of Nutritional and Environmental Medicine}}</ref>
* Antithyroid [[antibodies]] – for evidence of [[autoimmune disease]]s that may be damaging the thyroid gland
* Serum cholesterol – which may be elevated in hypothyroidism
* [[Prolactin]] – as a widely available test of pituitary function
* Testing for anemia, including [[ferritin]]
* Basal body temperature

==Treatment==
{{Main|Thyroid hormone#Medical use of thyroid hormones|l1=Medical use of thyroid hormones}}
Hypothyroidism is treated with the levorotatory forms of [[thyroxine]] ([[levothyroxine]]) (L-T<sub>4</sub>) and [[triiodothyronine]] (liothyronine) (L-T<sub>3</sub>). Synthroid, produced by Abbott Laboratories, is the brand name counterpart to the generic Levothyroxine. Synthroid is also the most common pill prescribed by doctors that has the synthetic thyroid hormone in it, and it is taken by over 40% of people with hypothyroidism.<ref name=CDCrecords/> This medicine can improve symptoms of thyroid deficiency such as slow speech, lack of energy, weight gain, hair loss, dry skin, and feeling cold. It also helps to treat goiter. It is also used to treat some kinds of thyroid cancer along with surgery and other medicines.
Both synthetic and animal-derived thyroid tablets are available and can be prescribed for patients in need of additional thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone is taken daily, and doctors can monitor blood levels to help assure proper dosing. Levothyroxine, the generic form of synthroid, is best taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, as some food can diminish absorption. Calcium can inhibit the absorption of levothryoxine.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nippoldt|first=Todd|title=Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid)|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hypothyroidism/AN01181|publisher=Maco Clinic|accessdate=01/23/2012}}</ref> Compared to water, coffee reduces absorption of levothyroxine by about 30 percent.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=293–301 |doi=10.1089/thy.2007.0222 |title=Altered Intestinal Absorption of L-Thyroxine Caused by Coffee |year=2008 |last1=Benvenga |first1=Salvatore |last2=Bartolone |first2=Luigi |last3=Pappalardo |first3=Maria Angela |last4=Russo |first4=Antonia |last5=Lapa |first5=Daniela |last6=Giorgianni |first6=Grazia |last7=Saraceno |first7=Giovanna |last8=Trimarchi |first8=Francesco |journal=Thyroid |volume=18 |issue=3 |pmid=18341376}}</ref> Some patients might appear to be resistant to levothyroxine, when in fact they do not properly absorb the tablets – a problem which is solved by pulverizing the medication.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/10507250360731596 |title=Tablet Formulation of Levothyroxine Is Absorbed Less Well Than Powdered Levothyroxine |year=2003 |last1=Yamamoto |first1=Toshihide |journal=Thyroid |volume=13 |issue=12 |pages=1177–81 |pmid=14751040}}</ref> There are several different treatment protocols in thyroid-replacement therapy:

;Desiccated thyroid extract: [[Desiccated thyroid extract]] is an animal-based thyroid extract, most commonly from a [[Pig|porcine]] source.

===Treatment controversy===
The potential benefit from substituting some T3 for T4 has been investigated, but no conclusive benefit for combination therapy has been shown.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=4946–54 |doi=10.1210/jc.2005-0184 |title=Treatment of Hypothyroidism with Combinations of Levothyroxine plus Liothyronine |year=2005 |last1=Escobar-Morreale |first1=H.

The 2002 Laboratory Medicine Practice Guidelines of the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry state that during pregnancy,
"The L-T4 dose should be increased (usually by 50 mcg/day) to maintain a serum TSH between 0.5 and 2.0 mIU/L and a serum FT4 in the upper third of the normal reference interval."  Doctors however often assume that if your TSH is in the "normal range", sometimes defined as high as 5.5 mIu/L, it has no effect on fertility. Healthy pregnant women however have a TSH level of around 1.0 mIU/L.

===Subclinical hypothyroidism===
There is a range of opinion on the biochemical and symptomatic point at which to treat with levothyroxine, the typical treatment for overt hypothyroidism.  Reference ranges have been debated as well.  As of 2003, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (ACEE) considers 0.3–3.0&nbsp;[[International unit|mIU/L]] within normal range.<ref>{{cite web |title=Subclinical Thyroid Disease |url=https://www.aace.com/files/position-statements/subclinical.pdf |work=Guidelines & Position Statements |date=April 10, 2013 |publisher=The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists |accessdate=2008-06-08}}</ref>

There is always the risk of [[overtreatment]] and hyperthyroidism.  Some studies have suggested that subclinical hypothyroidism does not need to be treated.  A 2007 [[meta-analysis]] by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] found no benefit of thyroid-hormone replacement except "some parameters of lipid profiles and left-ventricular function."<ref name="pmid17636722">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003419.pub2 |chapter=Thyroid hormone replacement for subclinical hypothyroidism |title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2007 |last1=Villar |first1=Heloisa Cerqueira Cesar Esteves |last2=Saconato |first2=Humberto |last3=Valente |first3=Orsine |last4=Atallah |first4=Álvaro N |editor1-last=Villar |editor1-first=Heloisa Cerqueira Cesar Esteves |pmid=17636722 |issue=3 |pages=CD003419 |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)}}</ref>

===Alternative treatments===
Compounded slow-release T3 has been suggested for use in combination with T4, which proponents argue will mitigate many of the symptoms of functional hypothyroidism and improve [[quality of life]]. This is still controversial and is rejected by the [[scientific consensus|conventional medical establishment]].<ref>{{cite journal |pages=655–9 |doi=10.1136/pgmj.2008.077701 |title=Management of thyroid disorders in primary care: challenges and controversies |year=2010 |last1=Todd |first1=C H |journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal |volume=85 |issue=1010 |pmid=20075403}}</ref>

===Non-human presentation===
Hypothyroidism is also a relatively common disease in domestic dogs, with some specific breeds having a definite predisposition.<ref>{{cite web |author=Brooks W |title=Hypothyroidism in Dogs |url=http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&A=461 |work=The Pet Health Library |date=01/06/2008 |publisher=VetinaryPartner.com |accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref>
