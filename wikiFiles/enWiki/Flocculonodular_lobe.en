The '''flocculonodular lobe''' ([[Anatomy of the cerebellum#Phylogenetic and functional divisions|vestibulocerebellum]]) is a lobe of the [[cerebellum]] consisting of the [[Nodule of vermis|nodule]] and the [[Flocculus (cerebellar)|flocculus]]. The two flocculi are connected to the midline structure called the nodulus by thin pedicles. It is placed on the anteroinferior surface of cerebellum.

This region of the cerebellum has important connections to the [[vestibular nuclei]] and uses information about head movement to influence eye movement. Lesions to this area can result in multiple deficits in visual tracking and oculomotor control (such as [[nystagmus]] and [[vertigo]]), integration of vestibular information for eye and head control, as well as control of axial muscles for balance.<ref>[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~rswenson/NeuroSci/chapter_8B.html Chapter 8B: Cerebellar Systems]</ref> This lobe is also involved in the maintenance of balance equilibrium and muscle tone.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mathias Baehr| coauthors = Michael Frotscher| title = Duus' Topical Diagnosis in Neurology: Anatomy, Physiology, Signs, Symptoms| url = http://books.google.com/?id=nQ0OTiIcslMC| date = 2012-01-25| publisher = Thieme| isbn = 978-3-13-164455-8 }}</ref>
