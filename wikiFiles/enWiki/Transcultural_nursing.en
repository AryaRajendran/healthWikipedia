As a discipline, it centers on combining international and transcultural content into the training of nurses.  It includes learning cultural differences, nursing in other countries, international health issues, and international health organizations.<ref name=NCBI/>

It's international establishment as a field in nursing continued from 1983 to the present.  After being formalized as a nursing course in 1966 at the University of Colorado, transcultural nursing programs and track programs were offered as masters and doctoral preparations during the early parts of the 1970s.<ref name=NCBI/>
