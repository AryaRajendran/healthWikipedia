A '''Corpus luteum cyst''' is a type of [[ovarian cyst]] which may rupture about the time of [[menstruation]], and take up to three months to disappear entirely. A corpus luteum cyst rarely occurs at age 50+, because eggs are no longer being produced in menopausal women.

==Pathophysiology==
This type of functional cyst occurs after an egg has been released from a follicle.  The follicle then becomes a secretory gland that is known as the [[corpus luteum]].   The ruptured follicle begins producing large quantities of [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]] in preparation for conception.  If a pregnancy doesn't occur, the corpus luteum usually breaks down and disappears.  It may, however, fill with fluid or blood, causing the corpus luteum to expand into a cyst, and stay in the ovary.  Usually, this cyst is on only one side, and does not produce any symptoms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ovarian-cysts-pcos.com/ovarian-cysts.html |title=Ovarian Cysts: What You Need to Know about an Ovarian Cyst and PCOS |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.med.utah.edu/kw/human_reprod/mml/hrovt_path_screenA14.html |title=Corpus luteum cyst |format= |work=Uni.

In women of reproductive age cysts with a diameter of less than 5cm are common, clinically inconsequential, and almost always a physiological condition rather than a cancer or other disease condition.<ref name="ACRfive">{{Citation |author1 = American College of Radiology |author1-link = American College of Radiology |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American College of Radiology]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Coll_Radiology.pdf |accessdate = August 17 2012}}, citing

==Presentation==
It can, however, grow to almost 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and has the potential to bleed into itself or twist the ovary, causing pelvic or abdominal pain.  If it fills with blood, the cyst may rupture, causing internal bleeding and sudden, sharp pain. Rarely, it may cause the ovary to twist around the ovarian ligament and can cut off the blood flow to the ovary. This is known as ovarian torsion and causes pain and other symptoms.

==Interaction with medication==
The fertility drug [[clomiphene citrate]] ([[Clomid]], Serophene), used to induce [[ovulation]], increases the risk of a corpus luteum cyst developing after ovulation.  These cysts don't prevent or threaten a resulting pregnancy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ovarian-cysts/DS00129/DSECTION=3 |title=Ovarian cysts: Causes |format= |work=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/popupnowrap.cfm?objectid=B9F3AC8A-4344-4BA2-950C412324709DB2&method=display_full |title=Corpus luteum cyst |format= |work=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=}}</ref>  Women on birth control pills usually do not form these cysts; in fact, preventing these cysts is one way the combined pill works.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.cfl.rr.com/dahmd/ovary.htm |title=Photos of the Ovaries |format= |work=Women's Health Information | author=Hill DA |accessdate=}}</ref>
In contrast, the progesterone-only pill can cause increased frequency of these cysts.
