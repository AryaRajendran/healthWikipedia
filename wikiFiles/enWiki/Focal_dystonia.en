'''Focal [[dystonia]]''' is a neurological condition that affects a muscle or group of muscles in a specific part of the body causing involuntary muscular contractions and abnormal postures. For example, in [[writer's cramp|focal hand dystonia]], the [[finger]]s either curl into the [[hand|palm]] or extend outward without control. In high-level musicians, the condition is referred to as musician's dystonia. In sports, it is commonly referred to as (the) [[yips]]. It is believed that all adult-onset dystonias are a product of combined genetic factors and environmental modifiers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hallet|first=Mark|title=Neurophysiology of dystonia: The role of inhibition|journal=Neurobiology of Disease|year=2011|volume=42|pages=177–184|doi=10.1016/j.nbd.2010.08.025}}</ref>

==Causes==
The cause of dystonia is not precisely understood. Misfiring of [[neuron]]s in the sensorimotor cortex, a thin layer of neural tissue covering the brain, is thought to cause contractions. The source of this misfiring may be a result of impaired inhibitory mechanisms during muscle contraction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hallet|first=Mark|title=Neurophysiology of dystonia: The role of inhibition|journal=Neurobiology of Disease|year=2011|volume=42|pages=177–184|doi=10.1016/j.nbd.2010.08.025}}</ref> When the brain tells a given muscle to contract, it simultaneously silences muscles that would oppose the intended movement. In dystonia, it appears that the ability of the brain to inhibit the surrounding muscles is impaired, leading to loss of selectivity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hallet|first=Mark|title=Neurophysiology of dystonia: The role of inhibition|journal=Neurobiology of Disease|year=2011|volume=42|pages=177–184|doi=10.1016/j.nbd.2010.08.025}}</ref> 

The sensorimotor cortex is organized as discrete "maps" of the human body. Under normal conditions, each body part (such as individual fingers) occupies a distinct area on these cortical maps. In dystonia, these maps lose their distinct borders and overlap occurs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Byl | first1 = NN | last2 = Merzenich | first2 = MM | last3 = Jenkins | first3 = WM. | year = 1996 | title = A primate genesis model of focal dystonia and repetitive strain injury: I.

Examination of the primary somatosensory cortex in the trained animals showed grossly distorted representations of the maps pertaining to the fingers when compared to the untrained animals.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Byl | first1 = NN | last2 = Merzenich | first2 = MM | last3 = Jenkins | first3 = WM. | year = 1996 | title = A primate genesis model of focal dystonia and repetitive strain injury: I.

Imaging studies in humans with focal dystonia have confirmed this finding.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bara-Jimenez | first1 = W | last2 = Catalan | first2 = MJ | last3 = Hallett | first3 = M | last4 = Gerloff | first4 = C | title = Abnormal somatosensory homunculus in dystonia of the hand | journal = Annals of neurology | volume = 44 | issue = 5 | pages = 828–831 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9818942 | doi = 10.1002/ana.410440520 }}</ref> Also, synchronous afferent stimulation of peripheral muscles induces organizational changes in motor representations, characterized both by an increase in map size of stimulated muscles and a reduction in map separation, as assessed using [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]].<ref>Schabrun SM, & Ridding MC (2007). “The influence of correlated afferent input on motor cortical representations in humans”.

The cross-connectivity between areas that are normally segregated in the sensory cortex may prevent normal sensorimotor feedback and so contribute to the observed co-contraction of antagonist muscle groups, and inappropriately timed and sequenced movements that underlie the symptoms of focal dystonia. It is hypothesized that a deficit in inhibition caused by a genetically mediated loss of inhibitory [[interneurons]] may be the underlying cause of the deficits observed in dystonia.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hallet|first=Mark|title=Neurophysiology of dystonia: The role of inhibition|journal=Neurobiology of Disease|year=2011|volume=42|pages=177–184|doi=10.1016/j.nbd.2010.08.025}}</ref>

While usually painless, in some instances the sustained contraction and abnormal posturing in dystonia may cause pain. Focal dystonia most typically affects those who rely on fine motor skills (musicians, writers, surgeons, etc.). It is thought that the excessive motor training in these individuals may contribute to the development of dystonia as their cortical maps become enlarged and begin to overlap.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rosenkranz|first=Karin|coauthors=Katherine Butler, Aaron Williamon, and John C. Rothwell|title=Regaining Motor Control in Musician’s Dystonia by Restoring Sensorimotor Organization|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=November 18, 2009|volume=29|issue=46|pages=14627–14636|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2094-09.2009}}</ref> Focal dystonia is generally "task specific," meaning that it is only problematic during certain activities.

==Treatment==
This condition is often treated with injections of [[botox]], a commercially prepared form of botulinum toxin. Botox reduces the symptoms of the disorder but it is not a cure for dystonia. Since the root of the problem is neurological, doctors have explored sensorimotor retraining activities to enable the brain to "rewire" itself and eliminate dystonic movements. The work of several doctors has shown that sensorimotor retraining activities and proprioceptive stimulation can induce [[neuroplasticity]], making it possible for patients to recover substantial function that was lost from focal dystonia.<ref>Farias J, Yoshie M.
