'''Physical dependence''' refers to a state resulting from chronic use of a drug that has produced [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] and where negative physical symptoms<ref name="urlDefinition of physical dependence - NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms">{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=454765 |title=Definition of physical dependence - NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms |work= |accessdate=2008-12-21}} {{Dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref> of [[withdrawal]]  result from abrupt discontinuation or dosage reduction.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Drug Addiction | work = | publisher = CNN | date = | url = http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/library/DS/00183.html | doi = | accessdate =  }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> Physical dependence can develop from low-dose therapeutic use of certain medications such as benzodiazepines, opioids, antiepileptics and antidepressants, as well as misuse of recreational drugs such as alcohol, opioids and benzodiazepines. The higher the dose used, the greater the duration of use, and the earlier age use began are predictive of worsened physical dependence and thus more severe withdrawal syndromes. Acute withdrawal syndromes can last days, weeks or months, and [[protracted withdrawal syndrome]], also known as "post-acute withdrawal syndrome" or "PAWS" - a low-grade continuation of some of the symptoms of acute withdrawal, typically in a remitting-relapsing pattern, that often results in relapse into active addiction and prolonged disability of a degree to preclude the possibility of lawful employment - can last for months, years, or, in relatively common to extremely rare cases, depending on individual factors, indefinitely. Protracted withdrawal syndrome is noted to be most often caused by [[benzodiazepines]], but is also present in a majority of cases of [[ethanol|alcohol]] and [[opioid]] addiction, especially that of a long-term, high-dose, [[adolescent]]-beginning, or chronic-relapsing nature (viz. a second or third addiction after withdrawal from the self-same substance of dependence). Withdrawal response will vary according to the dose used, the type of drug used, the duration of use, the age of the patient, the age of first use, and the individual person.<ref name="pmid1575069">{{cite journal |author=Landry MJ, Smith DE, McDuff DR, Baughman OL |title=Benzodiazepine dependence and withdrawal: identification and medical management |journal=J Am Board Fam Pract |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=167–75 |year=1992 |pmid=1575069 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
Physical dependence can manifest itself in the appearance of both physical and psychological symptoms which are caused by physiological adaptions in the central nervous system and the brain due to chronic exposure to a substance. Symptoms which may be experienced during withdrawal or reduction in dosage include increased heart rate and/or blood pressure, sweating, and tremors. More serious [[withdrawal]] symptoms such as [[confusion]], [[seizures]], and [[visual hallucinations]] indicate a serious emergency and the need for immediate medical care. Sedative hypnotic drugs such as [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[benzodiazepines]], and [[barbiturates]] are the only commonly available substances that can be fatal in withdrawal due to their propensity to induce withdrawal convulsions. Abrupt withdrawal from other drugs, such as [[opioid]]s can cause an extremely physiologically and psychologically painful withdrawal that is very rarely fatal in patients of general good health and with medical treatment, but is more often fatal in patients with weakened cardiovascular systems; toxicity is generally caused by the often-extreme increases in heart rate and blood pressure (which can be treated with [[clonidine]]), or due to arrhythmia due to electrolyte imbalance caused by the inability to eat, and constant diarrhea and vomiting (which can be treated with [[loperamide]] and [[ondansetron]] respectively) associated with acute opioid withdrawal, especially in longer-acting substances where the diarrhea and emesis can continue unabated for weeks, although life-threatening complications are extremely rare, and nearly non-existent with proper medical management. Dependence itself and chronic intoxication on psychostimulants can cause mild-to-moderate neurotoxic effects due to hyperthermia and generation of free radicals.;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sharma HS, Sjöquist PO, Ali SF |title=Drugs of abuse-induced hyperthermia, blood–brain barrier dysfunction and neurotoxicity: neuroprotective effects of a new antioxidant compound H-290/51 |journal=Current pharmaceutical design |volume=13 |issue=18 |pages=1903–23 |year=2007 |pmid=17584116 |doi= 10.2174/138161207780858375|url=http://www.bentham-direct.org/pages/content.php?CPD/2007/00000013/00000018/0006B.SGM}}</ref> this is treated with discontinuation; life-threatening complications are nonexistent.

==Treatment==
Treatment for physical dependence depends upon the drug being withdrawn and often includes administration of another drug, especially for substances that can be dangerous when abruptly discontinued. Physical dependence is usually managed by a slow dose reduction over a period of weeks, months or sometimes longer depending on the drug, dose and the individual.<ref name="pmid1575069" /> A physical dependence on alcohol is often managed with a cross tolerant drug, such as long acting [[benzodiazepines]] to manage the [[alcohol withdrawal]] symptoms.

Some drugs, like [[anticonvulsants]] and [[antidepressants]], describe the drug category and not the mechanism. The individual agents and drug classes in the anticonvulsant drug category act at many different receptors and it is not possible to generalize their potential for physical dependence or incidence or severity of [[rebound syndrome]] as a group so need to be looked at individually.
