In [[medicine]], '''paronychia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ær|ə|ˈ|n|ɪ|k|i|ə}}; {{lang-el|παρονυχία}}: para-, ''around'', onukh-, ''nail'') is a [[nail disease]] that is an often-tender bacterial or fungal infection of the hand or foot where the [[Nail (anatomy)|nail]] and skin meet at the side or the base of a [[fingernail|finger]] or [[toenail]]. The infection can start suddenly ([[acute paronychia]]) or gradually ([[chronic paronychia]]).<ref name="pmid18297959">{{cite journal |author=Rigopoulos D, Larios G, Gregoriou S, Alevizos A |title=Acute and chronic paronychia |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=339–46 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18297959 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid11277548">{{cite journal |author=Rockwell PG |title=Acute and chronic paronychia |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=1113–6 |year=2001 |month=March |pmid=11277548 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Paronychia is commonly misapplied as a synonym for [[whitlow]] or felon.

== Types ==
Paronychia may be divided as follows:<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |last2=Berger |first2=Timothy G. |display-authors=3}}</ref>

* [[Candidal paronychia]]
* [[Pyogenic paronychia]]

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:Infectionofcutical.JPG|thumb|An infection of the cutical secondary to a sliver]]
The skin typically presents as red and hot. These infections can be  painful.

[[Pus]] is usually present, along with gradual thickening and browning discoloration of the nail plate.

Acute paronychia is usually caused by bacteria. Claims have also been made that the popular acne medication, [[isotretinoin]], has caused paronychia to develop in patients. Paronychia is often treated with [[antibiotics]], either topical or oral. Chronic paronychia is most often caused by a [[yeast infection]] of the soft tissues around the nail but can also be traced to a bacterial infection. If the infection is continuous, the cause is often [[fungal infection in animals|fungal]] and needs [[antifungal medication|antifungal]] cream or paint to be treated.<ref name="hicks">{{Cite web

==Cause==
Risk factors include repeatedly washing hands and trauma to the cuticle such as from biting.

[[Herpes whitlow]]s are frequently found among dentists and dental hygienists.<ref name="Lewis_2004">{{cite journal |author=Lewis MA |title=Herpes simplex virus: an occupational hazard in dentistry |journal=Int Dent J |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=103–11 |year=2004 |pmid=15119801 |doi=10.2956/indj.2004.54.2.103 |url=http://www.idjonline.org/view.php?article_id=32&journal_id=9 |doi_brokendate=2008-08-12}}</ref> Prosector's paronychia is a primary inoculation of [[tuberculosis]] of the skin and nails, named after its association with [[prosector]]s, who prepare specimens for dissection. Paronychia around the entire nail is sometimes referred to as ''runaround paronychia''.

Painful paronychia in association with a scaly, [[erythematous]], [[keratotic rash]] ([[papules]] and plaques) of the ears, nose, fingers, and toes, may be indicative of [[acrokeratosis paraneoplastica]], which is associated with [[squamous]] cell [[carcinoma]] of the [[larynx]].<ref name="Allen_2005">{{cite web | title=eMedicine - Acrokeratosis Neoplastica | author= Karen Allen, MD | url=http://www.emedicine.com/derm/topic6.htm | date=2005-08-17 }}</ref>

Paronychia can occur with [[diabetes]], drug-induced [[immunosuppression]],<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1106062-clinical</ref> or systemic diseases such as pemphigus.<ref>http://dermatology-s10.cdlib.org/1507/reviews/nail_pemphigus/rashid.html</ref>

== Treatment ==
Warm soaks can be used 3 or 4 times a day for acute paronychia to promote drainage and relieve some of the pain. Most cases of acute paronychia benefit from being treated with antibiotics such as [[cephalexin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] or [[amoxicillin]] .<ref name="dermatology.about.com">Heather Brannon, MD http://dermatology.about.com/cs/paronychia/a/paronychia.htm</ref> Topical antibiotics or anti-bacterial ointments do not effectively treat paronychia. If there is pus or an abscess involved, the infection may need to be incised and drained. Rarely, a portion of the nail may need to be removed.

Chronic paronychia is treated with topical antibacterial medication such as [[Mupirocin|Mupirocin ointment]]. A mild topical steroid like [[hydrocortisone]] may be added to the antibacterial medication to help reduce inflammation. Steroids should never be used alone on a chronic paronychia.<ref name="dermatology.about.com"/>
