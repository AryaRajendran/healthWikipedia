The portion of the [[pleura]] external to the [[pulmonary pleura]] lines the inner surface of the [[chest]] wall, covers the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]], and is reflected over the structures occupying the middle of the [[thorax]]; this portion is termed the '''parietal pleura'''. 

The parietal pleura is attached to the wall of the thoracic cavity and innervated by the [[intercostal nerves]] and [[phrenic nerve]].

Parietal pleura lines the thoracic wall, covers the superior surface of the diaphragm and separates the pleural cavity from the [[mediastinum]]. The costal portion of the parietal pleura lines the inner aspect of the ribs and intervening intercostal muscles, being separated from them by [[endothoracic fascia]]. This part of the parietal pleura is innervated by the intercostal nerves. The diaphragmatic portion of the parietal pleura overlies the diaphragm and is innervated by the phrenic nerve in its central portion and by the intercostal nerves in its peripheral portion. The mediastinal portion of the parietal pleura forms the lateral wall of the mediastinum and is innervated by the phrenic nerve.
