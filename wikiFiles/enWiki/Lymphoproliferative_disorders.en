'''Lymphoproliferative disorders''' (LPDs) refer to several conditions in which [[lymphocytes]] are produced in excessive quantities. They typically occur in patients who have compromised [[immune system]]s. They are sometimes equated with "[[immunoproliferative disorders]]", but technically Lymphoproliferative disorders are a subset of immunoproliferative disorders, along with [[hypergammaglobulinemia]] and [[paraproteinemias]].

==Examples of LPDs==
* [[follicular lymphoma]]
* [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]]
* [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]]
* [[hairy cell leukemia]]
* [[lymphoma]]s
* [[multiple myeloma]]
* [[Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia]]
* [[Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome]]
* [[post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder]]
* [[Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS)]]

==Types==
Lymphoproliferative disorders are a set of disorders characterized by the abnormal proliferation of [[lymphocyte]]s into a [[monoclonal]] [[lymphocytosis]]. The two major types of lymphocytes are B cells and T cells, which are derived from [[pluripotent]] [[hematopoetic stem cells]] in the bone marrow. Individuals who have some sort of immunodysfuction are susceptible to develop a lymphoproliferative disorder because when any of the numerous control points of the immune system become dysfunctional, [[immunodeficiency]] or deregulation of lymphocytes is more likely to occur. There are several inherited [[mutation|gene mutations]] that have been identified to cause lymphoproliferative disorders, however there are also acquired and [[iatrogenic]] causes.<ref name="item14">Winter, S.S.

===X-linked Lymphoproliferative disorder===
{{main|X-linked lymphoproliferative disease}}
There is a mutation on the [[X chromosome]] that has been found to be associated with a [[T cell]] and [[NK cell]] lymphoproliferative disorder.

===Autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder===
{{main|Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome}}
Some children with autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorders are heterozygous for a mutation in the gene that codes for the [[Fas receptor]]. Which is located on the long arm of [[chromosome 10]] at position 24.1, denoted 10q24.1.<ref name="item2">Entrez Gene. FAS Fas (TNF receptor superfamily, member 6). http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=gene&dopt=full_report&list_uids=355. Accessed March 2007.</ref> This gene is member 6 of the TNF-receptor superfamily (TNFRSF6). The Fas receptor contains a death domain and has been shown to play a central role in the physiological regulation of programmed cell death. Normally, stimulation of recently activated T cells by antigen leads to coexpression of Fas and Fas receptor on the T cell surface. The engagement of Fas by Fas receptor results in [[apoptosis]] of the cell and is important for eliminating T cells that are repeatedly stimulated by antigens.<ref name="item1">Abbas, A.K and Lichtman, A.H. Cellular and Molecular Immunology. Fifth Edition. Elsevier Saunders. Philadelphia. 2005</ref> As a result of the mutation in the Fas receptor gene, there is no recognition of Fas by [[Fas receptor]], leading to a primitive population of T cells that proliferates in an uncontrolled manner.<ref name="item14" />

===Other inherited causes===
Boys with X-linked immunodeficiency syndrome are at a higher risk of mortality associated with [[Epstein-Barr Virus]] infections, and are predisposed to develop a lymphoproliferative disorder or lymphoma. 

Children with [[common variable immune deficiency]] (CVID) are also at a higher risk of developing a lymphoproliferative disorder. 

Some disorders that predispose a person to lymphoproliferative disorders are [[severe combined immuno deficiency]] (SCID), [[Ch√©diak-Higashi syndrome]], Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (an X-linked recessive disorder) and [[Ataxia telangiectasia]]. 

Interestingly, even though Ataxia telangiectasia is an autosomal recessive disorder, people who are [[heterozygote]]s for this still have an increased risk of developing a lymphoproliferative disorder.<ref name="item14" />

===Acquired causes===
[[Viral infection]] is a very common cause of lymphoproliferative disorders. The most common is congenital [[HIV]] infection because it is highly associated with acquired immunodeficiency, which often leads to lymphoproliferative disorders.<ref name="item14" />

===Iatrogenic causes===
There are many lymphoproliferative disorders that are associated with [[organ transplantation]] and [[immunosuppressant]] therapies. In most reported cases, these cause B cell lymphoproliferative disorders, however some T cell variations have been described.<ref name="item14" /> The T cell variations are usually caused by the prolonged use of T cell suppressant drugs, such as [[sirolimus]], [[tacrolimus]] or [[cyclosporine A]].<ref name="item14" />
