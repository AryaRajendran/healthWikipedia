[[Image:Coagulation_full.svg|thumb|360px|alt=Schematic diagram of the blood coagulation and [[protein C]] pathways. In the blood coagulation pathway, thrombin acts to convert factor XI to XIa, VIII to VIIIa V to Va, fibrinogen to fibrin. In addition, thrombin promotes platelet activation and aggregation via activation of protease-activated receptors on the cell membrane of the platelet. Thrombin also cross over into the protein C pathway by converting protein C into APC. APC in turn converts factor V into Vi, and VIIIa into VIIIi. Finally APC activates PAR-1 and EPCR.|Role of thrombin in the blood coagulation cascade]]

Thrombin in turn acts as a serine protease that converts soluble [[fibrinogen]] into insoluble strands of [[fibrin]], as well as catalyzing many other coagulation-related reactions.

==History==
After the description of fibrinogen and fibrin, [[Alexander Schmidt (physiologist)|Alexander Schmidt]] hypothesised the existence of an enzyme that converts fibrinogen into fibrin in 1872.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schmidt A|year=1872|title=Neue Untersuchungen ueber die Fasserstoffesgerinnung|journal=Pflüger's Archiv für die gesamte Physiologie|volume=6|pages=413–538|doi=10.1007/BF01612263}}</ref>

==Physiology==
===Synthesis===
Thrombin is produced by the enzymatic cleavage of two sites on prothrombin by activated [[Factor X]] (Xa). The activity of factor Xa is greatly enhanced by binding to activated [[Factor V]] (Va), termed the prothrombinase complex. Prothrombin is produced in the liver and is post-translationally modified in a [[vitamin K]]-dependent reaction that converts ten glutamic acids on prothrombin to [[gamma-carboxyglutamic acid]] (Gla). In the presence of calcium, the Gla residues promote the binding of prothrombin to phospholipid bilayers (see the picture). Deficiency of vitamin K or administration of the anticoagulant [[warfarin]] inhibits the production of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues, slowing the activation of the coagulation cascade.

In human adults, the normal blood level of [[antithrombin]] activity has been measured to be around 1.1 units/mL. Newborn levels of thrombin steadily increase after birth to reach normal adult levels, from a level of around 0.5 units/mL 1 day after birth, to a level of around 0.9 units/mL after 6 months of life.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Andrew M, Paes B ''et al''.|year=1987|title=Development of the human coagulation system in the full-term infant|journal=Blood|volume=70|issue=1|pages=165–172|pmid=3593964}}</ref>

===Mechanism of action===
In the blood coagulation pathway, thrombin acts to convert [[factor XI]] to XIa, [[factor VIII|VIII]] to VIIIa, [[factor V|V]] to Va, and [[fibrinogen]] to [[fibrin]].

[[Factor XIIIa]] is a [[transglutaminase]] that catalyzes the formation of covalent bonds between lysine and glutamine residues in fibrin. The covalent bonds increase the stability of the fibrin clot. Thrombin [[Protein-protein interaction|interacts]] with [[thrombomodulin]].<ref name="pmid8663147">{{cite journal|author=Bajzar L, Morser J, Nesheim M|title=TAFI, or plasma procarboxypeptidase B, couples the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades through the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex|journal=J. Biol. Chem.|volume=271|issue=28|pages=16603–8|year=1996|month=July|pmid=8663147|doi=10.1074/jbc.271.28.16603|url=|issn=}}</ref><ref name="pmid2544585">{{cite journal|author=Jakubowski HV, Owen WG|title=Macromolecular specificity determinants on thrombin for fibrinogen and thrombomodulin|journal=J. Biol. Chem.|volume=264|issue=19|pages=11117–21|year=1989|month=July|pmid=2544585|doi=|url=|issn=}}</ref>

As part of its activity in the coagulation cascade, thrombin also promotes [[platelet]] activation and aggregation via activation of [[protease-activated receptor]]s on the cell membrane of the platelet.

===Negative feedback===
Thrombin bound to thrombomodulin activates [[protein C]], an inhibitor of the coagulation cascade. The activation of protein C is greatly enhanced following the binding of thrombin to [[thrombomodulin]], an integral membrane [[protein]] expressed by [[endothelial]] cells. Activated protein C inactivates factors Va and VIIIa. Binding of activated protein C to [[protein S]] leads to a modest increase in its activity. Thrombin is also inactivated by [[antithrombin]], a [[serpin|serine protease inhibitor]].

==Protein==
[[Image:1nl2 opm.gif|thumb|Anchoring of bovine prothrombin to the membrane through its [[Gla domain]].<ref name="pmid12923575">{{PDB|1nl2}}; {{cite journal|author=Huang M, Rigby AC, Morelli X, Grant MA, Huang G, Furie B, Seaton B, Furie BC|title=Structural basis of membrane binding by Gla domains of vitamin K-dependent proteins|journal=Nat.

The molecular weight of prothrombin is approximately 72,000 [[atomic mass unit|Da]]. The catalytic domain is released from prothrombin fragment 1.2 to create the active enzyme thrombin, which has a molecular weight of 36,000 Da.

==Gene==
The thrombin (prothrombin) gene is located on the eleventh [[chromosome]] (11p11-q12).<ref name="pmid3474786"/>

There are an estimated 30 people in the world that have been diagnosed with the congenital form of Factor II deficiency,<ref name="pmid7792730">{{cite journal|author=Degen SJ, McDowell SA, Sparks LM, Scharrer I|title=Prothrombin Frankfurt: a dysfunctional prothrombin characterized by substitution of Glu-466 by Ala|journal=Thromb. Haemost.|volume=73|issue=2|pages=203–9|year=1995|month=February|pmid=7792730|doi=|url=|issn=}}</ref> which should not be confused with the [[prothrombin G20210A]] mutation, which is also called the factor II mutation. Prothrombin G20210A is congenital.<ref name="pmid15262854">{{cite journal|author=Varga EA, Moll S|title=Cardiology patient pages. Prothrombin 20210 mutation (factor II mutation)|journal=Circulation|volume=110|issue=3|pages=e15–8|year=2004|month=July|pmid=15262854|doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000135582.53444.87|url=|issn=}}</ref>

Prothrombin G20210A is not usually accompanied by other factor mutations (i.e., the most common is factor V Leiden). The gene may be inherited [[heterozygous]] (1 pair), or much more rarely, [[homozygous]] (2 pairs), and is not related to gender or blood type. Homozygous mutations increase the risk of thrombosis more than heterozygous mutations, but the relative increased risk is not well documented. Other potential risks for thrombosis, such as oral contraceptives may be additive. The previously reported relationship of inflammatory bowel disease (i.e., Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) and prothrombin G20210A or [[factor V]] Leiden mutation have been contradicted by research.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bernstein CN, Sargent M, ''et al''.|year=2007|title=Mutations in clotting factors and inflammatory bowel disease|journal=Am. J. Gastroenterol.|volume=102|issue=2|pages=338–343|pmid=17156138|doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2006.00974.x}}</ref>

==Role in disease==
Activation of prothrombin is crucial in physiological and pathological coagulation. Various rare diseases involving prothrombin have been described (e.g., [[hypoprothrombinemia]]). Anti-prothrombin [[Antibody|antibodies]] in [[autoimmune disease]] may be a factor in the formation of the [[lupus anticoagulant]] also known as ([[antiphospholipid syndrome]]). [[Hyperprothrombinemia]] can be caused by the G20210A mutation.

Thrombin, a potent [[vasoconstrictor]] and [[mitogen]], is implicated as a major factor in [[vasospasm]] following [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]]. Blood from a ruptured [[cerebral aneurysm]] clots around a cerebral [[artery]], releasing thrombin. This can induce an acute and prolonged narrowing of the blood vessel, potentially resulting in [[cerebral ischemia]] and [[infarction]] ([[stroke]]).

Beyond its key role in the dynamic process of thrombus formation, thrombin has a pronounced pro-inflammatory character, which may influence the onset and progression of atherosclerosis. Acting via its specific cell membrane receptors (protease activated receptors: PAR-1, PAR-3 and PAR-4), which are abundantly expressed in all arterial vessel wall constituents, thrombin has the potential to exert pro-atherogenic actions such as inflammation, leukocyte recruitment into the atherosclerotic plaque, enhanced oxidative stress, migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, apoptosis and angiogenesis.<ref>Borissoff JI, Spronk HM, Heeneman S, ten Cate H.

==Applications==
===Research tool===
Due to its high proteolytic specificity, thrombin is a valuable biochemical tool. The thrombin cleavage site (Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser) is commonly included in linker regions of [[recombinant fusion protein]] constructs. Following purification of the fusion protein, thrombin can be used to selectively cleave between the Arginine and Glycine residues of the cleavage site, effectively removing the [[purification tag]] from the protein of interest with a high degree of specificity.

===Medicine and surgery===
[[Prothrombin complex concentrate]] and [[fresh frozen plasma]] are prothrombin-rich coagulation factor preparations that can be used to correct deficiencies (usually due to medication) of prothrombin. Indications include intractable bleeding due to [[warfarin]].

Manipulation of prothrombin is central to the mode of action of most [[anticoagulant]]s. [[Warfarin]] and related drugs inhibit [[vitamin K]]-dependent carboxylation of several coagulation factors, including prothrombin. [[Heparin]] increases the affinity of antithrombin to thrombin (as well as [[factor X]]a). The [[direct thrombin inhibitor]]s, a newer class of medication, directly inhibit thrombin by binding to its active site.

Recombinant thrombin is available as a powder for reconstitution into [[aqueous solution]]. It can be applied [[topical]]ly during surgery, as an aid to [[hemostasis]]. It can be useful for controlling minor bleeding from capillaries and small venules, but ineffective and not indicated for massive or brisk arterial bleeding.<ref name="pmid17660072">{{cite journal|author=Chapman WC, Singla N, Genyk Y, McNeil JW, Renkens KL, Reynolds TC, Murphy A, Weaver FA|title=A phase 3, randomized, double-blind comparative study of the efficacy and safety of topical recombinant human thrombin and bovine thrombin in surgical hemostasis|journal=J.
