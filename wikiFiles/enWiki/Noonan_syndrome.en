'''Noonan syndrome''' (NS) is a relatively common [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] [[congenital disorder]]  that affects both males and females equally<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''. (10th ed.). Saunders. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref>{{rp|550}}. It used to be referred to as the male version of [[Turner's syndrome]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Curcić-Stojković O, Nikolić L, Obradović D, Krstić A, Radić A |title=[Noonan's syndrome. (Male Turner's syndrome, Turner-like syndrome)] |journal=Med Pregl |volume=31 |issue=7–8 |pages=299–303 |year=1978 |pmid=692497}}</ref> (and is still sometimes described in this way);<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000073092|Noonan syndrome}}</ref> however, the genetic causes of Noonan syndrome and Turner syndrome are distinct. The principal features include [[congenital heart defect]] (typically [[pulmonary valve stenosis]]) also [[Atrial septal defect|ASD]], [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]], short stature, learning problems, [[pectus excavatum]], impaired blood clotting, and a characteristic configuration of facial features including a webbed neck and a flat nose bridge.  The [[syndrome]] is named after Dr. [[Jacqueline Noonan]].  It is a [[RASopathy]], as the syndrome is in the family of RAS-MAPK pathway disorders.

It is believed that between approximately 1 in 1,000 and 1 in  2,500 children worldwide are born with NS. It is one of the most common genetic syndromes associated with congenital heart disease, similar in frequency to [[Down syndrome]]. However, the range and severity of features can vary greatly in patients with NS. Therefore, the syndrome is not always identified at an early age.

== Characteristics ==
Often called a "hidden" condition, the person affected may have no obvious casual signs to the onlooker, but the problems may be many and complex.
The most prevalent (common) signs are highlighted in '''bold''' with frequency listed in parentheses.

== Cause ==
[[Image:Autosomal dominant - en.svg|thumb|right| NS may be inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] pattern with variable expression.]]
Recurrence in siblings and apparent transmission from parent to child has long suggested a genetic defect with [[autosomal dominant]] inheritance and variable expression. Mutations in the [[Ras subfamily|Ras]]/[[MAP kinase|mitogen activated protein kinase]] signaling pathways are known to be responsible for ~70% of NS cases.<ref name=Razzaque2012>Razzaque MA, Komoike Y, Nishizawa T, Inai K, Furutani M, Higashinakagawa T, Matsuoka R (2012) Characterization of a novel KRAS mutation identified in Noonan syndrome. Am J Med Genet A {{doi|10.1002/ajmg.a.34419}}.</ref> 

A person with NS has up to a 50% chance of transmitting it to a child. The fact that an affected parent is not always identified for children with NS suggests several possibilities:
# manifestations are variably expressed and could be so subtle as to go unrecognized (variable [[expressivity]])
# a high proportion of cases represent new, sporadic [[mutation]]s or
# Noonan syndrome is [[heterogeneous]], comprising more than one similar condition of differing cause, some not inherited.

A condition known as "[[neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome]]" is associated with [[neurofibromin 2|neurofibromin]].<ref>{{cite pmid|16380919}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
Despite identification of six causative genes, the diagnosis of Noonan syndrome is still based on clinical features. In other words, it is made when a physician feels that a patient has enough of the features to warrant the label indicating association. 

The following genes are known to cause NS with the percentage of cases in brackets.
PTPN11  (50%) RAF1 (3-17%) SOS1 (10%),  KRAS (1%) , NRAS (unknwown) or BRAF (unknown).

An absence of a mutation will not exclude the diagnosis as there are more as yet undiscovered genes that cause NS. The principal values of making such a diagnosis are that it guides additional medical and developmental evaluations, it excludes other possible explanations for the features, and it allows more accurate recurrence risk estimates. With more genotype-phenotype correlation studies being performed, a positive genetic diagnosis, will help the clinician to be aware of possible anomalies specific to that certain gene mutation, for example, there is an increase in  hypotrophic cardiomyopathy in patients with a mutation on the KRAS gene, and patients with a mutation on PTPN11 have an increased risk of Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. In the future, there will be scope for targeted management of Noonan Syndrome, depending on what genetic mutation the patient has.

== History ==
[[File:Noonan1883.JPG|thumb|The oldest known case of Noonan syndrome, described in 1883 by Kobylinski]]
[[Jacqueline Noonan]] was practicing as a pediatric cardiologist at the [[University of Iowa]] when she noticed that children with a rare type of heart defect, [[pulmonary stenosis|valvular pulmonary stenosis]], often had a characteristic physical appearance with [[short stature]], [[webbed neck]], [[wide spaced eyes]], and [[low-set ears]].  Both boys and girls were affected.  Even though these characteristics were sometimes seen running in families, [[karyotype|chromosomes]] appeared grossly normal.  She studied 833 patients at the congenital heart disease clinic, looking for other congenital abnormalities, and in 1962 presented a paper: "Associated non-cardiac malformations in children with congenital heart disease". This described 9 children who in addition to congenital heart disease had characteristic faces, chest deformities and short stature. Both males and females were found to be similarly affected, and the chromosomes were apparently normal.

Dr. John Opitz, a former student of Dr. Noonan, first began to call the condition "Noonan Syndrome" when he saw children who looked like those whom Dr. Noonan had described. Dr. Noonan later produced a paper entitled "Hypertelorism with Turner Phenotype", and in 1971 at the Symposium of Cardiovascular defects, the name 'Noonan Syndrome' became officially recognized.
