'''Central core disease''' (CCD), also known as '''central core myopathy''', is an [[autosomal]] [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]]<ref name=ryr>{{cite journal |pmid=12124989 |year=2002 |month=August |author=Robinson, Rl; Brooks, C; Brown, Sl; Ellis, Fr; Halsall, Pj; Quinnell, Rj; Shaw, Ma; Hopkins, Pm |title=RYR1 mutations causing central core disease are associated with more severe malignant hyperthermia in vitro contracture test phenotypes |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=88–97 |doi=10.1002/humu.10098 |journal=Human Mutation}}</ref> [[congenital myopathy]] (inborn [[skeletal muscle|muscle]] disorder). It was first described by Shy and Magee in 1956.<ref name=Quinlivan>{{cite journal |author=Quinlivan RM |title=Central core disease: clinical, pathological, and genetic features |journal=Arch. Dis.

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of CCD are variable, but usually involve [[hypotonia]] (decreased muscle tone) at birth, mild delay in [[child development]] (highly variable between cases), weakness of the [[facial muscles]], and skeletal malformations such as [[scoliosis]] and [[dislocation of hip|hip dislocation]].<ref name=Quinlivan/>

Symptoms may be present at birth or may appear at any stage of life. There appears to be a growing number of people who do not become symptomatic until adulthood to middle age. While generally not progressive, again there appears to be a growing number of people who do experience a slow clinically significant progression of symptomatology. These cases may hypothetically due to the large number of gene mutations of ryanodine receptor malfunction, and with continued research may in fact be found to be clinical variants.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is made on the combination of typical symptoms and the appearance on [[biopsy]] (tissue sample) from muscle. The name derives from the typical appearance of the biopsy on [[light microscopy]], where the muscle cells have cores that are devoid of [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and specific [[enzyme]]s.<ref name=Quinlivan/>

[[Respiratory failure|Respiratory insufficiency]] develops in a small proportion of cases. [[Creatine kinase]] and [[electromyography]] (EMG) tend to be normal.<ref name=Quinlivan/>

==Pathophysiology==

[[Image:Autosomal dominant - en.svg|thumb|right|Central core disease has an autosomal dominant pattern of [[inheritance]].]]

Central core disease is inherited in an [[autosomal]] [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] fashion. Most cases have demonstrable mutations in the [[ryanodine receptor|ryanodine receptor type 1]] (''RYR1'') gene,<ref name=ryr/> which are often ''de novo'' (newly developed). People with CCD are at risk for [[malignant hyperthermia]] (MH) when receiving [[general anesthesia]].<ref name=Quinlivan/>

==Treatment==
There is no specific treatment but triggering anesthetics are avoided and relatives are screened for ''RYR1'' mutations as these may make them susceptible to MH.<ref name=Quinlivan/>
