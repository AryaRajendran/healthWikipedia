'''Healthy Howard''' is a county-sponsored health care program offered to certain [[Uninsured in the United States|uninsured residents]] of [[Howard County, Maryland]]. The program, which provides doctors visits and [[prescription drug]]s, has been nationally hailed as a model to offer health care to local lower income people without health insurance.<ref name="baltimore.bizjournals.com">{{cite news |title=Health reform could mean the end for Healthy Howard program |first=Julekha |last=Dash |work=Baltimore Business Journal |date=August 14, 2009 |url=  http://baltimore.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/2009/08/17/story16.html }}</ref>

The program started on October 1, 2008 with a plan to accommodate 2,200 people in a salary range of $35,000 to $63,600 for a family of four.<ref>{{cite news |title=County launches Healthy Howard outreach |work=Howard County Times |date=January 8, 2009 |first=Derek |last= Simmonsen |url=http://www.explorehoward.com/news/14573/county-launches-healthy-howard-outreach/ }}</ref> Plans were to increase this number by 2000 enrollees each year thereafter.<ref name="washingtonpost.com">{{cite news |title=Howard Health Initiative Ready to Enroll Uninsured |work=The Washington Post |date=September 30, 2008 |first=Lori |last=Aratani |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/29/AR2008092902904.html }}</ref>

Services are also offered to those who become [[unemployment|unemployed]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Healthy Howard opens to newly unemployed |first=Derek |last=Simmonsen |work=Howard County Times |date=February 6, 2009 |url=http://www.explorehoward.com/news/15497/healthy-howard-opens-newly-unemployed/ }}</ref>

==Details==
The program is open to those who make between 117% and 300% of the [[federal poverty guidelines|federal poverty income level]] and are not eligible for [[Medicaid]]. It costs between $50 and $80 monthly, and it provides [[physician]] visits and [[prescription drug]]s.<ref name="baltimore.bizjournals.com"/><ref>{{cite news |title=In New Model, County Offers Low-Cost Health Care |work=National Public Radio |date=June 16, 2009 |first=Robert |last=Siegel |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105444714&ft=1&f=1001 }}</ref>

It is not considered a [[health insurance]] program and does not cover any care received outside the boundaries of Howard County.<ref name="washingtonpost.com"/>

The program, which costs $2.8 million annually to operate, is funded with a combination of premiums, county funds, and private donations<ref>{{cite news |title=Maryland county idea offers access for uninsured |work=American Medical News |date=December 3, 2007 |first=Doug |last=Trapp |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2007/12/03/gvsb1203.htm }}</ref><ref name="washingtonpost.com"/>

==Issues==
The program has shown to be difficult to sell, falling below expectations. Initially, the county had presumed that they would need to hold a lottery to determine which of the county's 15,000 uninsured residents would be getting its 2,200 slots.<ref>{{cite news |title=Low-Cost Health Care in Howard Not an Easy Sell |work=The Washington Post |first=Lori |last=Aratani |date=February 24, 2009 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/23/AR2009022302545_pf.html }}</ref>

It was found that many when they attempted to sign up for the Healthy Howard program were actually eligible for other health care programs

==Future==
It has been predicted that if national [[health care reform]] is passed, there will be no need for Healthy Howard to continue. Some, however, believe the program can be converted into a health insurance plan.<ref name="baltimore.bizjournals.com"/>
