'''Follicular lymphoma''' is the most common of the indolent [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]s, and the second-most-common form of [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]s overall. It is defined as a [[lymphoma]] of [[lymph follicle|follicle]] center [[B-cells]] (centrocytes and centroblasts), which has at least a partially follicular pattern. It is positive for the B-cell markers CD10, CD19, CD20, and CD22<ref>[http://pleiad.umdnj.edu/hemepath/follicular/follicular.html Overview] at [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey|UMDNJ]]</ref> but almost always negative for [[CD5 (protein)|CD5]].<ref name="pmid11419985">{{cite journal |author=Barekman CL, Aguilera NS, Abbondanzo SL |title=Low-grade B-cell lymphoma with coexpression of both CD5 and CD10.

There are several synonymous and obsolete terms for this disease, such as CB/CC lymphoma (Centroblastic and Centrocytic lymphoma), nodular lymphoma<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000954451|follicular lymphoma}}</ref> and Brill-Symmers Disease.

==Morphology==
The [[tumor]] is composed of follicles containing a mixture of [[centrocyte]]s (Kiel nomenclature adopted by WHO experts) or cleaved follicle center cells (older American nomenclature), "[[B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia|small cells]]", and [[centroblast]]s (Kiel nomenclature adopted by WHO experts) or large noncleaved follicle center cells (older American nomenclature), "[[large cells]]". These follicles are surrounded by non-malignant cells, mostly T-cells. In the follicles, centrocytes typically predominate; centroblasts are usually in minority.

==Grading==
[[File:Follicular lymphoma, spleen.jpg|thumb|Classic appearance of spleen involved by follicular lymphoma, namely the presence of discrete, miliary, small, white "pearly" nodules throughout the whole parenchyma.]]
According to the WHO criteria, the disease is morphologically graded into:<ref name="urlFollicular Lymphomas">{{cite web |url=http://pleiad.umdnj.edu/hemepath/follicular/follicular.html |title=Follicular Lymphomas |work= |accessdate=2008-07-26}}</ref>
* grade 1 (<5 centroblasts per high-power field (hpf))
* grade 2 (6–15 centroblasts/hpf)
* grade 3 (>15 centroblasts/hpf).

Grade 3 is further subdivided into:
** grade 3A (centrocytes still present)
** grade 3B (the follicles consist almost entirely of centroblasts)

The clinical relevance of this grading system is still being debated; Grades 1, 2, and 3A are considered to be indolent and incurable, whereas grade 3B is considered an aggressive but curable disease similar to [[diffuse large B-cell lymphoma]]. Occasional cases may show plasmacytoid differentiation or [[wiktionary:foci|foci]] of [[marginal zone]] or [[monocytoid]] B-cells.

==Causes==
A [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]] between [[chromosome]] 14 and 18 results in the overexpression of the [[bcl-2]] gene.<ref name="pmid12529293">{{cite journal |author=Bosga-Bouwer AG, van Imhoff GW, Boonstra R, ''et al.'' |title=Follicular lymphoma grade 3B includes 3 cytogenetically defined subgroups with primary t(14;18), 3q27, or other translocations: t(14;18) and 3q27 are mutually exclusive |journal=Blood |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=1149–54 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12529293 |doi=10.1182/blood.V101.3.1149 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12529293}}</ref> As the bcl-2 protein is normally involved in preventing [[apoptosis]], cells with an overexpression of this protein are basically immortal. The bcl-2 gene is normally found on chromosome 18, and the translocation moves the gene near to the site of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer element on chromosome 14.

Translocations of [[BCL6]] at 3q27 can also be involved.<ref name="pmid16075463">{{cite journal |author=Bosga-Bouwer AG, Haralambieva E, Booman M, ''et al.'' |title=BCL6 alternative translocation breakpoint cluster region associated with follicular lymphoma grade 3B |journal=Genes Chromosomes Cancer |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=301–4 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16075463 |doi=10.1002/gcc.20246}}</ref>

==Treatment==
There is no consensus regarding the best treatment protocol. Several considerations should be taken into account including age, stage, and prognostic scores. Patients with advanced disease who are asymptomatic might benefit of a watch and wait approach as early treatment does not provide survival benefit{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. When patients are symptomatic, specific treatment is required, which might include various combinations of alkylators, nucleoside analogues, anthracycline-containing regimens (e.g., [[CHOP]]) monoclonal antibodies (rituximab), radioimmunotherapy, autologous, and allogeneic [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]]. The disease is regarded as incurable (although allogeneic stem cell transplantation may be curative, the [[death|mortality]] from the procedure is too high to be a first line option). The exception is localized disease, which can be cured by local [[irradiation]].

Personalised idiotype vaccines have shown great promise, but has still to prove its efficacy in randomized clinical trials.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Inoges S, de Cerio AL, Soria E, Villanueva H, Pastor F, Bendandi M |title=Idiotype vaccines for human B-cell malignancies |journal=Curr. Pharm. Des. |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=300–7 |year=2010 |month=January |pmid=20109139 |doi= 10.2174/138161210790170111|url=http://www.benthamdirect.org/pages/content.php?CPD/2010/00000016/00000003/0006B.SGM}}</ref>

In 2010 [[Rituximab]] was approved by the EC for first-line maintenance treatment of follicular lymphoma.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/roche-gets-ec-nod-for-follicular-lymphoma-maintenance-therapy/81244149/ |title=Roche Gets EC Nod for Follicular Lymphoma Maintenance Therapy |date=October 29, 2010 }}</ref>

Trial results released in June 2012 show that [[bendamustine]], a drug first developed in East Germany in the 1960s, more than doubled disease [[progression-free survival]] when given along with [[rituximab]]. The combination also left patients with fewer side effects than the older treatment (a combination of five drugs -- rituximab, cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), doxorubicin (Adriamycin), vincristine and prednisone, collectively called [[R-CHOP]]). <ref>{{cite news |url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/news/articles/2012/06/03/rediscovered-lymphoma-drug-helps-double-survival-study|title='Rediscovered' Lymphoma Drug Helps Double Survival: Study |date=June 3, 2012 }}</ref>

There are a large number of recent and current clinical trials for FL.<ref>http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=follicular+lymphoma</ref>

==Prognosis==
[[Median]] survival is around 10 years, but the range is wide, from less than one year, to more than 20 years. Some patients may never need treatment. The overall survival rate at 5 years is 72-77%.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|203268|Lymphoma, Follicular}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Of all [[lymphoproliferative disorders|cancers involving the same class of blood cell]], 22% of cases are follicular lymphomas.<ref name="isbn0-7817-5007-5">{{cite book
