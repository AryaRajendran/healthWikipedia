'''Traction alopecia''' is a form of [[alopecia]], or gradual hair loss, caused primarily by pulling force being applied to the hair.<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''. (10th ed.). Saunders. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref>{{rp|761}}<ref name="Fitz2">Freedberg, et al. (2003). ''Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine''. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. ISBN 0-07-138076-0.</ref>{{rp|645}} This commonly results from the sufferer frequently wearing his/her hair in a particularly tight [[ponytail]], [[pigtail]]s, or [[braid]]s. It is also seen occasionally in long-haired people who use [[barrette]]s to keep hair out of their faces.

Traction alopecia is a substantial risk in [[hair weave]]s, which can be worn either to conceal [[hair loss]], or purely for [[Beauty|cosmetic]] purposes.  The former involves creating a [[braid]] around the head below the existing hairline, to which an extended-wear hairpiece, or [[Wig (hair)|wig]], is attached.  Since the hair of the braid is still growing, it requires frequent maintenance, which involves the hairpiece being removed, the natural hair braided again, and the piece snugly reattached.  The tight braiding and snug hairpiece cause tension on the hair that is already at risk for falling out. Traction Alopecia is one of the most common causes of hair loss in African American women. Although the aforementioned style is one of the culprits, hairstyles such as dreadlocks and single (extension) braids can also have the same effect.<ref>{{cite web

== Helmets, hats and headgear ==
Compressive safety helmets worn tightly and closely to the scalp are a cause of traction alopecia. The lining of tightly fitted safety helmets like those worn for activities such as motorcycling, cycling, skiing and snowboarding are responsible for the constant rubbing and tugging of localised areas of the hair and scalp. Frequent wearers or those who use such helmets for prolonged periods seem more likely to suffer traction alopecia. Remedies which contain vasodilators for the scalp such as [[Menthogen]] may help by the frequent encouragement and promotion of 'healthy' blood supply to the localised balding area/s.{{fact|date=August 2012}}
