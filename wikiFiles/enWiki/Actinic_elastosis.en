'''[[Actinic]]''', or '''solar''', '''elastosis''' is an accumulation of abnormal [[elastin]] (elastic tissue) in the [[dermis]] of the [[skin]],<ref name=weedon> {{cite book |title= Weedon's Skin Pathology, 3rd Edition |last=Weedon |first=David |authorlink=David Weedon |year=2010 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-7020-3485-5}} </ref> and in the [[conjunctiva]] of the [[human eye|eye]],<ref> {{cite book |last1=Klintworth |first1=G |last2=Cummings |first2=T |editor1-first=Mills |editor1-last=Stacey |title=Sternberg's Diagnostic Surgical Pathology |edition=5 |isbn=978-0-7817-7942-5 |chapter=24; The eye and ocular adnexa }}</ref> which occurs as a result of the cumulative effects of prolonged and excessive sun exposure, a process known as ''photoaging''.

==Clinical features==
Actinic elastosis usually appears as thickened, dry, wrinkled skin.  Several clinical variants have been recorded.  One of the most readily identifiable is the thickened, deeply fissured skin seen on the back of the chronically sun-exposed neck, known as ''[[cutis rhomboidalis nuchae]]''.<ref name=weedon/> These features are a part of the constellation of changes that are seen in photoaged skin.<ref name=weedon/>

==Causes / Aetiology==
The origin of the elastotic material in the dermis remains a subject of debate.  Theories on the formation of the elastotic material include actinic stimulation of [[fibroblast]]s, promoting synthesis of this material; or that the material is a degradation product of [[collagen]], [[elastin]] or both.<ref name=weedon/>

==Histopathology==
In the earlier stages of actinic elastosis, elastic fiber proliferation can be seen in the dermis. As the condition becomes more established, the collagen fibers of the [[papillary dermis]] and [[reticular dermis]] become increasingly replaced by thickened and curled fibers that form tangled masses and appear [[basophilic]] under routine [[haematoxylin]] and [[eosin]] staining.  These fibers stain black with the [[Verhoeff stain]].<ref name=weedon/>

==Treatment==
There are numerous treatment options for photoaged skin.  These include [[dermabrasion]], topical application of [[retinoic acid]], [[carbon dioxide laser]] resurfacing, [[hyaluronic acid]] injection into the dermis, [[Imiquimod]], [[tacrolimus]] ointment and topical [[oestrogen]] therapy.  These treatments have variable [[efficacy]].<ref name=weedon/>

The most effective prevention strategy for photoaging remains minimization of sun-exposure through use of sunscreen and other sun exposure avoidance measures.<ref name=weedon/>
