'''Multiple chemical sensitivity''' ('''MCS''') is a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic medical condition]] characterized by [[symptoms]] that the affected person attributes to low-level chemical exposure. Commonly accused substances include smoke, pesticides, plastics, synthetic fabrics, scented products, petroleum products, and paint fumes. Symptoms are often [[vagueness|vague]] and [[non-specific symptoms|non-specific]], such as [[nausea]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[dizziness]] and [[headache]]s, but also commonly include [[inflammation]] of [[skin]], [[joints]], [[gastrointestinal tract]] and [[airways]].

MCS is a disputed diagnosis and is controversially not recognized as an organic, chemical-caused illness by the [[American Medical Association]] and some other US based organisations.<ref name="Gots"/> [[Blinding (medicine)|Blinded]] clinical trials have shown MCS patients react as often and as strongly to [[placebo]]s, including clean air,<ref name="Das-Munshi 2006"/><ref name="Bornschein"/> as they do to the chemicals they say harm them. This has led some in the healthcare profession to believe MCS symptoms are due to odor hypersensitivity<ref name="Thriel"/> or are mainly psychological.<ref name="Gots"/> Regardless of the [[etiology]], some people with severe symptoms are [[disabled]] as a result.

MCS has been given many different names by proponents, including '''toxic injury''' (TI), '''chemical sensitivity''' (CS), '''chemical injury syndrome''' (CI), '''20th century syndrome''', '''environmental illness''' (EI), '''[[sick building syndrome]]''', '''[[idiopathic]] environmental intolerance''' (IEI), and '''toxicant-induced loss of tolerance''' (TILT).  These names generally are intended to name the cause favored by the proponent or to emphasize the severity of symptoms.<ref>Michaels, ''supra'', states: "Some advocates refer to this disability as Chemical Injury Syndrome (CIS), which they believe more effectively communicates the severity of this disability."</ref>

==Definition==
Six consensus criteria were identified by researchers for the diagnosis and definition of MCS in 1989 (later edited in 1999):<ref name=Joffres2005>{{cite journal|author=Joffres MR, Sampalli T, Fox RA|title=Physiologic and symptomatic responses to low-level substances in individuals with and without chemical sensitivities: a randomized controlled blinded pilot booth study |accessdate=2007-03-04 |journal=Environ Health Perspect |volume=113|issue=9|pages=1178–83 |pmid=16140624|doi=10.1289/ehp.7198|year=2005|pmc=1280398 }}</ref>  

#Symptoms are reproducible with repeated (chemical) exposures.
#The condition has persisted for a significant period of time.
#Low levels of exposure (lower than previously or commonly tolerated) result in manifestations of the syndrome (i.e. increased sensitivity).
#The symptoms improve or resolve completely when the triggering chemicals are removed.
#Responses often occur to multiple chemically unrelated substances.
#Symptoms involve multiple-organ symptoms (runny nose, itchy eyes, headache, scratchy throat, ear ache, scalp pain, mental confusion or sleepiness, palpitations of the heart, upset stomach, nausea and/or diarrhea, abdominal cramping, aching joints).<ref name="pmid10444033">{{cite journal |author= |title=Multiple chemical sensitivity: a 1999 consensus |journal=Arch.

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (a division of the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]]) defines MCS as a "chronic, recurring disease caused by a person's inability to tolerate an environmental chemical or class of foreign chemicals".<ref name=NIEHSFAQ>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070516181511/http://www.niehs.nih.gov/external/faq/mcss.htm MCSS factsheet] &mdash; United States National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</ref>  MCS has also been described as a group of "sensitivities to extraordinarily low levels of environmental chemicals" appearing "to develop ''de novo'' in some individuals following acute or chronic exposure to a wide variety of environmental agents including various pesticides, solvents, drugs, and air contaminants", including those found in sick buildings.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Miller CS|title=Toxicant-induced Loss of Tolerance-An Emerging Theory of Disease? |accessdate=2007-03-04 |journal=Environ Health Perspect. |volume=105|issue=2|pages=445–53 |pmid=9167978|doi=10.2307/3433351|year=1997|pmc=1469811|publisher=Brogan &#38|jstor=3433351 }}</ref> 

Environmental medicine specialists claim MCS causes negative health effects in multiple organ systems, and respiratory distress, seizures, cognitive dysfunction, [[Cardiac arrhythmia|heart arrhythmia]], nausea, headache, and fatigue can result from exposure to levels of common chemicals that are normally deemed as safe.<ref name="Gibson&Ruding 2003">{{Cite pmid|12948890 }}</ref><ref name="Rea et al. 2006">Rea, WJ, Johnson, AR, Ross, GH, Butler, JR, Fenyves, EJ, Griffiths, B,& Laseter, J (2006).

===Lack of widespread recognition===
The [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD), maintained by the [[World Health Organization]], does not recognize multiple chemical sensitivity or environmental sensitivity as a valid diagnosis.<ref name=Sears>Sears, Margaret E. 2007.

The [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) has stated that because of the lack of scientific evidence, based on well-controlled clinical trials, that supports a cause-and-effect relationship between exposure to very low levels of chemicals and the myriad symptoms reported by clinical ecologists, MCS is not recognized as an established [[organic disease]]. The [[American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology]], the [[California Medical Association]], the [[American College of Physicians]], and the [[International Society of Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology]] also do not recognise it.<ref name="Gots"/><ref name="AMA">{{cite journal

Although sometimes misrepresented as evidence these groups recognize MCS as a specific disease, the booklet states a pathogenesis of MCS has not been definitively proven.  The booklet further states symptoms that have been self-diagnosed by a patient as related to MCS could actually be related to allergies or have a psychological basis.

In 1995, an Interagency Workgroup on Multiple Chemical Sensitivity was formed under the supervision of the Environmental Health Policy Committee within the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] to examine the body of research that had been conducted on MCS to that date.  The work group included representatives from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], [[United States Department of Energy]], [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]], and the [[National Institutes of Health]].  The Predecisional Draft document generated by the workgroup in 1998  recommended additional research in the basic epidemiology of MCS, the performance of case-comparison and challenge studies, and the development of a case definition for MCS.  However, the workgroup also concluded it was unlikely MCS would receive extensive financial resources from federal agencies due to budgetary restraints and the allocation of funds to other, extensively overlapping syndromes with [[medically unexplained symptoms|unknown etiology]], such as [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[fibromyalgia]], and [[Gulf War syndrome]].  The Environmental Health Policy Committee is currently inactive, and the workgroup document has not been finalized.<ref>http://web.health.gov/environment/mcs/</ref>

With regard to the potential for exposure to chemicals in the workplace and MCS, the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has indicated MCS is highly controversial and there is insufficient scientific evidence to explain the relationship between the theorized causes of MCS and its symptoms.  However, OSHA recommends "…an evaluation must be performed by a physician knowledgeable of the symptoms of this condition."<ref>http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/multiplechemicalsensitivities/index.html</ref>

A 1997 court decision held that MCS "is untested, speculative, and far from generally accepted in the medical or toxicological community," and thus cannot be used as the basis for disability claims.<ref>''Frank v. New York'', 972 F. Supp. 130 (N.D.N.Y. 1997)</ref> Furthermore, accommodations sought for MCS are sometimes denied as being unreasonable as a matter of law.<ref>Andrew K. Kelley, "COMMENT: Sensitivity Training: Multiple Chemical Sensitivity and the ADA," 25 B.C. Envtl. Aff. L. Rev. 485; see, for example, ''Whillock v. Delta Air Lines'', 926 F.Supp. 1555 (N.D.Ga. 1995) http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/ealr/vol25/iss2/5/</ref>

===Limited recognition in some situations===
In 1997, U.S. [[Social Security Administration]] Commissioner John Callahan issued a court memorandum officially recognizing MCS "as a medically determinable impairment" on an agency-wide basis.<ref>October 31, 1997, R-164, Creamer v. Callahan</ref>  That is, without making any statement about the cause of MCS or the role of chemicals in MCS, the Social Security administration agrees that some MCS patients are too disabled to be meaningfully employed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0424515064!opendocument |title=DI 24515.064 Evaluation Of Specific Issues — Environmental Illness|publisher=[[Social Security Administration]] |accessdate=8 May 2010 |quote=Therefore, in evaluating claims based on environmental illness, all of the claimant's symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings must be considered to determine if there is a medically determinable impairment and the impact of any impairment on the claimant's ability to work. This evaluation should be made on an individual case-by-case basis to determine if the impairment prevents substantial gainful activity.}}</ref>

==Clinical trials==

There have been both trials that support and don't support the claim that the symptoms of multiple chemical sensitivity are caused by chemicals.

A double-blind inhalant challenge in 1991 concluded, "The conclusion of the study is that in these patients, chemical sensitivity clearly does exist (pulse rate differences between positive responses and placebo - p .001)"<ref name="rea">Confirmation of chemical sensitivity by means of double-blind inhalant challenge of toxic volatile chemicals [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=Retrieve&list_uids=1807272&dopt=abstractplus]</ref>

A 1991 controlled comparison of symptoms and chemical intolerances reported by Gulf War veterans, implant recipients and persons with multiple chemical sensitivity suggests that "some patients with antecedent chemical exposures, whether exogenous (chemical spill, pesticide application, indoor air contaminants) or endogenous (implant), develop new chemical, food, and drug intolerances."<ref name="miller2">A controlled comparison of symptoms and chemical intolerances reported by Gulf War veterans, implant recipients and persons with multiple chemical sensitivity, CS Miller, Toxicol Ind Health. 1999 Apr-Jun;15(3-4):386-97 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10416290]</ref>

A 1993 double-blind study suggested that MCS subjects could not discriminate between their chemical triggers and clean air when an olfactory masker was introduced that eliminated the ability to discriminate on the basis of odor.<ref>Staudenmayer H, Selner JC, Buhr MP., Double-blind provocation chamber challenges in 20 patients presenting with "multiple chemical sensitivity". ul Toxicol Pharmacol. 1993 Aug;18(1):44-53.</ref> 

In a 2008 double-blind study, a variety of responses, including the subjective perception of being exposed to solvents, increases in blood pressure or heart rate, or increased symptom severity, were measured following the double-blind exposure to several solvents. People with an MCS diagnosis showed no differences in these parameters when they were exposed to clean air or to solvents at a concentration too low to smell.<ref name="Bornschein">{{cite journal |author=Bornschein S, Hausteiner C, Römmelt H, Nowak D, Förstl H, Zilker T. |title=Double-blind placebo-controlled provocation study in patients with subjective Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) and matched control subjects |journal=Clin Toxicol (Phila). |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=443–9 |year=2008 |pmid=18568800 |doi=10.1080/15563650701742438}}</ref> The trial did not support the hypothesis that MCS is directly related to the effects of chemical exposures.  Since MCS sufferers seem to have symptoms only when they perceive exposure to chemicals, the syndrome is proposed to be a result of odor hypersensitivity in which individuals have an exaggerated response to scents,<ref name="Thriel">{{cite journal |author=van Thriel C, Kiesswetter E, Schäper M, Juran SA, Blaszkewicz M, Kleinbeck S |title=Odor annoyance of environmental chemicals: sensory and cognitive influences |journal=J.

A 2010 Italian study that genotyped patients diagnosed with MCS, with suspected MCS, and healthy controls suggested inhibition of expression and activity of metabolizing and [[antioxidant]] enzymes in MCS, accelerated lipid oxidation, increased [[nitric oxide]] production and [[glutathione]] depletion and increased plasma inflammatory [[cytokine]]s.<ref name="deluca">Biological definition of multiple chemical sensitivity from redox state and cytokine profiling and not from polymorphisms of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20430047]</ref>

==Symptoms==

Symptoms of MCS may be mild to disabling. Symptoms may be physical or psychological in nature and are essentially those that are disruptive to the individuals’ mental or physical wellness and that the individual attributes to exposure to a chemical or scent. 

By far, the most common symptoms are vague, [[non-specific symptom|non-specific]] complaints:  [[fatigue (medical)|feeling tired]], "brain fog" (short-term memory problems, difficulty concentrating) and muscle pain.<ref name=Gibson>[http://www.ilru.org/html/publications/bookshelf/MCS.html Understanding and Accommodating People With MCS], Pamela Reed Gibson, Ph.D.</ref>  These complaints are common to a large number of medical conditions, from psychiatric conditions, such as [[major depressive disorder]], to neurological conditions, such as [[orthostatic intolerance]], to [[sleep disorder]]s, [[high blood pressure]], [[autoimmune diseases]] and [[cancer]].

A partial list of other symptoms patients have attributed to MCS include [[dyspnea|difficulty breathing]], pains in the throat, chest, or abdominal region, [[asthma]], skin irritation, contact [[dermatitis]], and [[hives]] or other forms of [[skin rash]], [[headaches]], neurological symptoms ([[neuralgia|nerve pain]], [[Paresthesia|pins and needles]] feelings, [[weakness]], trembling, [[restless leg syndrome]], etc.), [[tendonitis]], [[seizure]]s, visual disturbances (blurring, halo effect, inability to focus), extreme [[anxiety]], panic and/or anger, sleep disturbance, suppression of immune system, digestive difficulties, [[nausea]], [[indigestion]]/[[heartburn]], [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], joint pains, vertigo/dizziness, abnormally acute sense of smell ([[hyperosmia]]), sensitivity to natural plant fragrance or natural pine [[terpene]]s, insomnia, dry mouth, dry eyes, and an overactive bladder.<ref name="Gibson&Ruding 2003"/><ref name=Gibson/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Ross PM, Whysner J, Covello VT, Kuschner M, Rifkind AB, Sedler MJ, Trichopoulos D, Williams GM | year = 1999 | title = Olfaction and Symptoms in the Multiple Chemical Sensitivities Syndrome | url = | journal = Preventative Medicine | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 467–480 | pmid = 10329337 | doi=10.1006/pmed.1998.0469}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Graveling RA, Pilkington A, George JPK, Butler MP, Tannahill SN | year = 1999 | title = A review of multiple chemical sensitivity | url = | journal = Occupational and Environmental Medicine | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 73–85 | pmid = 10448311 }}</ref>

==Causes==
There is no clear consensus as to what causes the symptoms of MCS; there may be several.

===Misdiagnosis===
More than half of 54 people from one study about MCS instead had [[somatoform disorder]]<ref name="pmid16314597">{{cite journal |author=Bailer J, Witthöft M, Paul C, Bayerl C, Rist F |title=Evidence for overlap between idiopathic environmental intolerance and somatoform disorders |journal=[[Psychosom Med]] |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=921–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16314597 |doi=10.1097/01.psy.0000174170.66109.b7 |url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16314597}}</ref> or [[panic disorder]].<ref>Binkley KE, Kutcher S. Panic response to sodium lactate infusion in patients with multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome. J Allergy Clin Immunol 1997;99:570-4.</ref>  Other possible explanations include [[migraine]], [[anxiety disorder]], [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]], [[postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome]] or other forms of [[orthostatic intolerance]], [[hay fever]] and other allergies, [[hypercalcemia]], [[hypothyroidism]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[fibromyalgia]], or mast cell activation diseases such as [[mastocytosis]], where symptoms such as brain fog and headaches can be triggered by  chemicals or inhalants.  Sufferers may also have a tendency to "catastrophically misinterpret benign physical symptoms"<ref name="titleMedscape & eMedicine Log In">{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/411615 |title= Idiopathic Environmental Intolerance May Have Psychological Component |accessdate=2008-01-13 |format= |work=}}</ref> or simply a disturbingly acute sense of smell.<ref name="titlestoppingSmell">{{cite web |url=http://www.myhealthsense.com/F010508_stoppingSmell.html |title=stoppingSmell |accessdate=2008-01-13 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071212083747/http://www.myhealthsense.com/F010508_stoppingSmell.html |archivedate = December 12, 2007}}</ref>

===Psychological===<!-- DO NOT DELETE JUST BECAUSE YOU DISAGREE.  See the Talk page for more information. -->
Several mechanisms for psychological etiology have been proposed, including theories based on stress, Pavlovian conditioning, or misdiagnoses of an underlying mental illness. Behavior exhibited by MCS sufferers may reflect broader sociological fears about industrial pollution.<ref>E. Shorter, Multiple chemical sensitivity: pseudodisease in historical perspective, ''Scand J Work Environ Health'' '''23''' (1997) (suppl 3), pp. 35–42</ref>

The distinction between physiological and psychological causes is often difficult to test,<ref name="Das-Munshi 2006">J. Das-Munshi, G. J. Rubin, S. Wessely, Multiple chemical sensitivities: A systematic review of provocation studies, ''Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology'', '''118''', pp.1257-1264 (2006)</ref> and it is particularly challenging for MCS because substances used to test for sensitivity can often be detected by scent. Odor cues make [[double blind]] studies of MCS patients difficult, and scents might provoke a [[Psychosomatic illness|psychosomatic response]]. Research in 2005 found patients only experienced symptoms when they themselves initiated the challenge tests. When they were given random prompts, there was no difference between MCS patients and controls in terms of physical and psychologic symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Saito M, ''et al.'' |title=Symptom profile of multiple chemical sensitivity in actual life |accessdate=2007-04-01 |journal=Psychosomatic Medicine |volume=67 |issue=2 (2005 Mar-Apr) |pages=318–25 |pmid=15784800 |doi=10.1097/01.psy.0000155676.69030.28 |year=2005 }}</ref> Their conclusion was "MCS patients do not have either somatic or psychologic symptoms under chemical-free conditions, and symptoms may be provoked only when exposed to chemicals," although their results showed it was not the chemicals themselves that caused the symptoms.

A review of 37 provocation studies concluded "persons with MCS do react to chemical challenges; however, these responses occur when they can discern differences between active and sham substances, suggesting that the mechanism of action is not specific to the chemical itself and might be related to expectations and prior beliefs".<ref name="Das-Munshi 2006"/>

An alternative psychological cause has been suggested by a recent case-control study in which MCS was associated with a personality trait called ''absorption'', in which individuals are predisposed to becoming deeply immersed in sensory experiences, leading to self-altered states of consciousness (see [[Flow (psychology)|Flow]]). When 54 MCS sufferers were compared to 44 subjects with a somatoform disorder and 54 normal individuals, only those with MCS had increased absorption scores, leading the authors to suggest absorption contributes to MCS by making individuals more susceptible to harboring beliefs in MCS, and these beliefs are reinforced by conditioning.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Witthöft M, Rist F, Bailer J |title=Evidence for a specific link between the personality trait of absorption and idiopathic environmental intolerance |journal=J. Toxicol. Environ. Health Part A |volume=71 |issue=11-12 |pages=795–802 |year=2008 |pmid=18569578 |doi=10.1080/15287390801985687 |url=}}</ref>

The cause and existence of MCS are disputed. In particular, doctors disagree about whether symptoms are physiologically or psychologically generated, or both. United States courts and several medical organizations reject MCS as a physiological disease. An approach called [[clinical ecology]] attempts to treat the disease, but this work is controversial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19850109&id=d2oVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ieEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6681,1850952|title='Clinical ecologists' hold controversial views|accessdate=2009-10-26|publisher=[[Eugene, OR|Eugene]] [[The Register-Guard|Register-Guard]]}}</ref>  Critics charge:

The scientific community remains divided, however, with many proponents of the psychosomatic school rejecting physiological explanations outright.

===Neurological===
One of the first studies on MCS (1993) focused on possible long-term potentiation in the [[hippocampi]] and neural sensitization as a central mechanism.<ref>Bliss, TV; Collingridge, GL.

In 2004, McKeown-Eyssen and colleagues showed polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 allele responsible for variation in toxicant metabolism pathways may cause differences in susceptibility to MCS.<ref name="McKeown et al. 2004"/>  Pall has suggested elevated nitric oxide and peroxynitrite (NO/ONOO-) as the etiology for MCS and several related conditions, including fibromyalgia, posttraumatic stress disorder, Gulf War syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome.<ref name="Pall 2003"/> This seems to be supported by a study by Reid et al. (2001) into the prevalence of MCS amongst British Gulf War syndrome sufferers. This study concluded veterans who had used personal organophosphate pesticides during the second Gulf War were 12 times more likely to develop MCS.<ref>Reid, S et al.

McKeown-Eyssen studied 203 MCS sufferers and 162 controls; blood tests revealed genetic differences relating to the body's detoxification processes were present more often in those with MCS than those without.<ref name="McKeown et al. 2004">{{cite journal | author = McKeown-Eyssen G, Baines C, Cole DE, Riley N, Tyndale RF, Marshall L, Jazmaji V. | title = Case-control study of genotypes in multiple chemical sensitivity: CYP2D6, NAT1, NAT2, PON1, PON2 and MTHFR | volume = 33| issue = 5 | pages = 971–8 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15256524 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyh251 | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine }}</ref> The data showed five genetic polymorphisms have a statistically significant role in determining MCS prevalence.<ref name="McKeown et al. 2004"/> Each of these genes encode proteins that metabolize chemicals previously implicated in MCS, notably the organophosphate pesticides ([[PON1]] and PON2 genes) and the organic solvents (CYP2D, NAT1 and [[NAT2]] genes). People with a ''high'' expression of two specific genes (CYP2D6 and NAT2) were 18 times more likely to have MCS than those without. They concluded "a genetic predisposition for MCS may involve altered biotransformation of environmental chemicals." Haley found similar, confirmatory results with the PON1 gene in studies of the Gulf War syndrome veterans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Haley RW, Billecke S, La Du BN |title=Association of low PON1 type Q (type A) arylesterase activity with neurologic symptom complexes in Gulf War veterans |journal=Toxicol.

(2006) confirmed the genetic variation previously found by McKeown-Eyssen and Haley.<ref name="Schnackenberget" /> A total of 521 unrelated individuals participated in the study. Genetic variants of four genes were analyzed: NAT2, [[GSTM1]], GSTT1, and [[GSTP1]]. The researchers concluded the individuals who are NAT2 slow acetylators and those with homozygously deleted [[GSTM1]] and GSTT1 genes are significantly more likely to develop chemical sensitivity. According to the study, the glutathione S-transferases act to inactivate chemicals, so people without these [[GSTM1]] and GSTT1 genes are less able to metabolize environmental chemicals, because "glutathione S-transferases play an important role in the detoxification of chemicals". The deletion of another gene, the [[GSTP1]] gene, leaves individuals more susceptible to developing these diseases, as lack of these genes means a loss of protection from oxidative stress.

A specific laboratory rat, the Flinders Sensitive line, has been bred by Dr. Overstreet to be sensitive to an [[organophosphate]], and displays "Increased sensitivity to [[cholinergic]] agents [that] has also been observed in several human populations, including individuals suffering from chemical intolerance."<ref>"David H. Overstreet & Veljko Djuric, [http://www.annalsnyas.org/cgi/content/abstract/933/1/92 A Genetic Rat Model of Cholinergic Hypersensitivity: Implications for Chemical Intolerance, Chronic Fatigue, and Asthma]. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 933: 92-102 (2001).</ref>  In particular, Flinders Sensitive rats show increased responses to nicotine, alcohol, and other chemicals known to act on acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin receptors.  However, these rats have not reacted abnormally to other chemicals thought to trigger MCS, such as perfume, in any known studies. Study of these rats may therefore provide useful clues about the mechanisms involved in some, but not all, forms of chemical intolerance in humans.

===Miscellaneous theories===

;Emotional stresses
People who have stronger emotional states will react more strongly to a smell.<ref>[http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2008/327/2]</ref>  The brain's emotional regions do not discriminate well between the different odors. That discrepancy between brain regions may relate to [[anxiety disorder]]s.  If the olfactory region does not distinguish a dangerous odor signal from a benign smell, the brain's [[fight-or-flight response|fight-or-flight region]] can overreact.<ref name=neergaard2008>{{cite news

Self-reported sensitivity to chemical exposures in five clinical populations and healthy controls. Psychiatry Res. 2000 Jul 24;95(1):67-74.</ref>

==Chemical triggers==
{{Refimprove|date=July 2008}}
Multiple chemicals have been reported to trigger MCS symptoms.<ref name="Rea et al. 2006"/><ref name="Magill"/>  In addition to anything which is perfumed or scented, complaints are commonly formed about everyday items:

;Food
* [[Tartrazine]] (a.k.a. FD&C Yellow #5 or E102), and other azo dyes{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} (true [[allergy]] must first be excluded)
* [[Caffeine]]
* [[Monosodium glutamate]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pall ML |title=NMDA sensitization and stimulation by peroxynitrite, nitric oxide, and organic solvents as the mechanism of chemical sensitivity in multiple chemical sensitivity |journal=FASEB J. |volume=16 |issue=11 |pages=1407–17 |year=2002 |month=September |pmid=12205032 |doi=10.1096/fj.01-0861hyp |url=}}</ref>

Multiple [[food intolerance]]s can be masked by a delayed reaction. These are not allergic reactions, and cannot be tested, only discovered by an elimination diet.

;Substances with strong scents
In a review of a two-phase population study, respondents with MCS indicated cleaning agents (88.4%), pesticides (81.2%), perfumes (81.2%), vehicle exhaust (72.5%), the products used in barber shops and beauty salons (60.9%), new carpeting (53.6%), new furniture (39.1%), chlorine in drinking water (29.1%), and fresh ink (26.1%) were the products most often reported to trigger reactions in the respondents.  They also indicated smoke from a fireplace, wood stove, or barbecue grill, and secondhand tobacco smoke were triggers for reactions.<ref>Caress SM, and Steinemann, AC (September 2003).  "A review of a two-phase population study of multiple chemical sensitivities."  "Environmental Health Perspectives.'' '''111(12)''':1490-1497.</ref>

Other reported {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} chemical triggers include:
* Gasoline (petrol) or diesel fuel
* Petroleum-based products, including petroleum jelly, tar, or asphalt
* Pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, and other agricultural chemicals
* Industrial cleaning chemicals, such as dry cleaning fluid
* Formaldehyde
* Glues, varnishes, polishes, paints, solvents, paint thinners, and [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs)
* [[sodium hypochlorite|Bleach]], [[fabric softener]]s, wool-wash, and laundry detergents<!-- NOTE:  Dryer sheets are a kind of fabric softener.  We do not need to list every possible form of fabric softener.  -->
* [[Perfumes]], lotion, aftershave lotion, nail polish, or skin care products
* Air fresheners, deodorizers and scented candles
* Shampoos, hairsprays and hair care products
* Dishwashing liquid and dishwasher detergent
* Marking pens, such as highlighters

==Diagnosis==
People who have developed symptoms of MCS have attributed a wide assortment of symptoms to chemical exposure, though symptoms are generally consistent for each individual.  The first step in diagnosing a potential MCS sufferer is to identify and treat all other conditions which are present and which often explain the reported symptoms.  For example, true allergy, thyroid disorders, orthostatic syndromes, anxiety, and depression need to be carefully evaluated and, if present, properly treated.

The "gold standard" procedure for identifying a person who has MCS is to test his or her response to the random introduction of chemicals the patient has self-identified as relevant, such as scented soaps or [[dryer sheet]]s.  This may be done in a carefully designed challenge booth to eliminate the possibility of contaminants in the room.  Chemicals and controls, sometimes called prompts, are introduced in a random method, usually scent-masked.  The test subject does not know when a prompt is being given.  Objective and subjective responses are measured.  Objective measures, such as the [[galvanic skin response]]<ref name=Joffres2005/> electrodermal response, indicate psychological arousal, such as fear, anxiety, or anger.  Subjective responses include patient self-reports.  A diagnosis of MCS can only be justified when the subject cannot consciously distinguish between chemicals and controls, and when responses are consistently present with exposure to chemicals and consistently absent when prompted by a control.

==Treatment==
In various studies, about one half of the patients who present with symptoms of MCS meet the criteria for [[Clinical depression|depressive]] and [[anxiety disorder]]s, and these conditions must be treated when present.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lax MB, Henneberger PK |title=Patients with multiple chemical sensitivities in an occupational health clinic: presentation and follow-up |journal=Arch. Environ. Health |volume=50 |issue=6 |pages=425–31 |year=1995 |pmid=8572720 |doi= 10.1080/00039896.1995.9935978|url=}}</ref> The use of [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI antidepressants]] with a 53-year-old man with multiple chemical sensitivities showed a dramatic improvement, which suggests, as with the general population, a subgroup of MCS patients may have an atypical depression and should be evaluated for this condition.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Andiné P, Rönnbäck L, Järvholm B |title=Successful use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in a patient with multiple chemical sensitivities |journal=Acta Psychiatr Scand |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=82–3 |year=1997 |month=July |pmid=9259230 |doi= 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1997.tb09910.x|url=}}</ref>

Another study showed psychotherapy resulted in significant, long-term improvement in MCS symptoms, although there was no control group to which to compare results.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lacour M, Zunder T, Dettenkofer M, Schönbeck S, Lüdtke R, Scheidt C |title=An interdisciplinary therapeutic approach for dealing with patients attributing chronic fatigue and functional memory disorders to environmental poisoning—a pilot study |journal=Int J Hyg Environ Health |volume=204 |issue=5-6 |pages=339–46 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11885358 |doi= 10.1078/1438-4639-00103|url=}}</ref>

While patients typically resist the potentially stigmatizing diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, many MCS sufferers benefit strongly from lifestyle changes.  A 2003 survey of 917 MCS patients revealed the two most effective treatments for MCS, in order of self-perceived harm/benefit ratio, were a chemical-free living space and chemical avoidance.  Next came [[prayer]] and [[meditation]], which presumably did no harm.<ref name="Gibson&Ruding 2003"/>  By comparison, two-thirds of patients who had tried [[Zoloft]] thought it was harmful. Other treatments with perceived harm included other pharmaceutical drugs, provocative neutralization, [[Hydrogen peroxide#Therapeutic use|hydrogen peroxide]], Metagenics' UltraClear medical food, and microhydrin antioxidants.  Overall, one or more antidepressants and anxiolytics were rated harmful by about half of survey respondents who had tried them, and as either harmless or helpful by the remaining respondents.

Other treatment modalities variably consist of the avoidance of known irritants, nutritional support to purge the body of its toxic load, sauna detoxification and autolymphycyte factor treatment.<ref name="Rea et al. 2006"/>

Because many people eliminate whole categories of food in an effort to reduce symptoms, a complete review of the patient's diet may be needed to avoid nutritional deficiencies.<ref name="titleOn Her Last Legs - New York Times">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/magazine/26wwln_diagnosis.html?_r=1&n=Top/News/Health/Diseases,%20Conditions,%20and%20Health%20Topics/Allergies&pagewanted=print&oref=slogin |title=On Her Last Legs - New York Times |accessdate=2008-01-25 |format= |work=The New York Times | first1=Lisa | last1=Sanders | date=2006-02-26}}</ref>

==History==
Allergist [[Theron Randolph|Theron G. Randolph]] (1906–1995) was the first to describe "the chemical intolerance phenomenon" in the mid-20th century, calling it "unwitting addiction" and comparing it to drug and alcohol addiction, with the addiction cycle being transparent to the patient as a masked intolerance.<ref name="Miller 2000">Miller, Claudia. Toxicant-induced Loss of Tolerance. Addiction 96 (2000), 115–139.</ref> When Randolph formulated his views, the term ''allergy'' was not connected with [[immunology]], as it has been since the late 1960s.<ref name="Miller 2000"/> It was then that non-immune-mediated hypersensitivities came to be called "intolerances", "idiopathic" or "idiosyncratic reactions" or "pseudoallergies". Randolph's theory was dismissed from the realm of [[allergology]] as the condition is not mediated by the [[humoral immune system]].<ref name="Miller 2000"/>

==Epidemiology==
As Magill and Seruda report:
<blockquote>Most patients (85 to 90 percent) complaining of MCS syndrome are women. Most present between the ages of 30 and 50 years. Much additional basic descriptive and epidemiologic information is still unknown. The incidence and prevalence are unknown. The question of whether MCS is becoming more or less common is unanswered, as is the question of whether it is preventable. The natural history and biologic outcomes of MCS are unknown, and descriptions of MCS in primary care settings have not been reported. Selected patients from specialty settings comprise reports of the syndrome.<ref name="Magill">{{cite journal |author=Magill MK, Suruda A |title=Multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=721–8 |year=1998 |month=September |pmid=9750540 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/980901ap/magill.html}}</ref></blockquote>

===Relationship to Gulf War syndrome===
Several clinical and epidemiological studies conducted in the United States and in the United Kingdom have investigated the occurrence of MCS in military personnel deployed to the Persian Gulf during the 1990s.  Some of the health complaints and symptoms reported by veterans of the Gulf War attributed to [[Gulf War syndrome]] are similar to those reported for MCS, including headache, fatigue, muscle stiffness, joint pain, inability to concentrate, sleep problems, and gastrointestinal issues.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gray GC, Gackstetter GD, Kang HK, Graham JT, Scott KC | year = 2004 | title = After more than 10 years of Gulf War Veteran medical evaluations, what have we learned? | url = | journal = American Journal of Preventative Medicine | volume = 26 | issue = 5| pages = 443–452 }}</ref>

A population-based, cross-sectional epidemiological study involving American veterans of the Gulf War, non-Gulf War veterans, and non-deployed reservists enlisted both during Gulf War era and outside the Gulf War era concluded the prevalence of MCS-type symptoms in Gulf War veterans was somewhat higher than in non-Gulf War veterans.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Black DW, Doebbeling BN, Voelker MD, Clarke WR, Woolson RF, Barrett DH, Schwartz DA | year = 2000 | title = Multiple Chemical Sensitivity Syndrome.  Symptom prevalence and the risk factors in a military population | url = | journal = Archive of Internal Medicine | volume = 160 | issue = | pages = 1169–1176 }}</ref>  After adjusting for potentially confounding factors (i.e., age, sex, and military training), there was a robust association between individuals with MCS-type symptoms and psychiatric treatment (either therapy or medication) before deployment and, therefore, before any possible deployment-connected chemical exposures.

The odds of reporting MCS or chronic multiple-symptom illness was 3.5 times greater for Gulf War veterans than non-Gulf veterans.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Thomas HV, Stimpson NJ, Weightman AL, Dunstan F, Lewis G | year = 2006 | title = Systematic review of multi-symptom conditions in Gulf War veterans."  Multi-symptom illnesses, unexplained illness, and Gulf War Syndrome" | url = | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 735–747 }}</ref>

Gulf War veterans have an increased rate of multiple-symptom conditions compared to military personnel deployed to other conflicts, and although it is unexplained, Gulf War syndrome is not considered distinct from other medically unexplained syndromes observed in civilian populations, including MCS.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ismail K, Lewis G | year = 2006 | title = Multi-symptom illnesses, unexplained illness, and Gulf War Syndrome | url = | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B | volume = 361 | issue = | pages = 543–551 }}</ref>
