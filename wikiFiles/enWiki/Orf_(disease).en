'''Orf''' is an exanthemous [[disease]] caused by a [[parapox virus]] and occurring primarily in [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s.  It is also known as '''contagious pustular dermatitis''', '''infectious labial dermatitis''', '''ecthyma contagiosum''', '''thistle disease'''<ref name=Winter_Charnley/> and '''scabby mouth'''. ''Orf virus'' is [[zoonotic]] - it can also infect humans.<ref name=Winter_Charnley>{{cite book|author=Winter, Agnes; Charmley, Judith|title=The Sheep Keeper's Veterinary Handbook|publisher=Crowood Press Ltd (Marlborough, UK)|year=1999|isbn=1-86126-235-3}}</ref>

==In humans==
Orf is a [[Zoonoses|zoonotic]] [[disease]], meaning humans can contract this disorder through direct contact with infected sheep and goats or with fomites carrying the orf virus. It causes a [[purulent]]-appearing [[papule]] locally and generally no systemic symptoms. Infected locations can include the finger, hand, arm, face and even the penis (caused by infection from the hand during urination). Consequently it is important to observe good personal hygiene and to wear gloves when treating infected animals.<ref name=Winter_Charnley/> The papule may persist for 7 to 10 weeks and spontaneously resolves. It is an uncommon condition and may be difficult to diagnose. There have been no reported cases of human to human contraction.  

While orf is usually a benign self-limiting illness, it can be very progressive and even life-threatening in the immune-compromised host. One percent topical [[cidofovir]] has been successfully used in a few patients with progressive disease. Serious damage may be inflicted on the eye if it is infected by orf, even among healthy individuals. The virus can survive in the soil for at least six months.<ref name=Couch>{{cite web|author=Couch,   Alan John;|year=1983|title=The Development of, and Host Response to,  Ovine Contagious Pustular Dermatitis|work=A thesis submitted to the  Faculty of Science of the University of New England, Armidale, N.S.W.,  in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Bachelor of  Science with Honours| url=http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.96642|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref>

==In sheep and  goats==
[[Image:sheep with orf.jpg|thumb|A sheep with orf infection on nose and lips]]
It has been  recorded since the late 19th century and has been reported from most sheep- or goat-raising areas  including those in Europe, the Middle East, the United States, Africa,  Asia, Alaska, South America, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.<ref name=Couch/> Orf is spread by [[fomite]]s and direct contact. In some  environments infection is injected by scratches from [[thistle]]s<ref  name=Winter_Charnley/> of both growing and felled plants.  Symptoms include [[papule]]s  and [[pustule]]s  on the lips and muzzle, and less commonly in the mouth of young lambs  and on the eyelids, feet, and [[teat]]s of ewes.  The lesions progress  to thick crusts which may bleed.  Orf in the mouths of lambs may prevent  suckling and cause weight loss, and can infect the udder of the mother  ewe, thus potentially leading to [[mastitis]].<ref  name=Winter_Charnley/> Sheep are prone to reinfection.<ref name=Fenner_1993>{{cite book|author=Fenner,  Frank J.; Gibbs, E. Paul J.; Murphy, Frederick A.; Rott, Rudolph;  Studdert, Michael J.; White, David O.|title=Veterinary Virology (2nd ed.)|publisher=Academic  Press, Inc|year=1993|isbn=0-12-253056-X}}</ref> Occasionally  the infection can be extensive and persistent if the animal does not  produce an immune response.<ref  name=Winter_Charnley/>

A live virus [[vaccine]] ([[ATCvet]] code: {{ATCvet|I04|AD01}})  is made from scab material and usually given to ewes at the age of two  months, but only to lambs when there is an outbreak.<ref name=Carter>{{cite web|author=Carter,  G.R.; Wise, D.J.|year=2006|title=Poxviridae|work=A Concise Review of  Veterinary Virology| url=http://www.ivis.org/advances/Carter/Part2Chap10/chapter.asp?LA=1|accessdate=2006-06-13}}</ref>  The vaccine  can cause disease in humans.

In sheep and goats the lesions  mostly appear on or near the hairline and elsewhere on the lips and  muzzle. In some cases the lesions appear on and in the nostrils, around  the eyes, on the thigh, coronet, vulva, udder and axilla. In rare cases,  mostly involving young lambs, lesions are found on the tongue, gums,  roof of the mouth and the oesophagus. It has also been reported a number  of times to cause lesions in the rumen. In one case it was shown that a  severe form of orf virus caused an outbreak involving the  gastrointestinal tract, lungs, heart, as well as the buccal cavity,  cheeks, tongue and lips. Another severe case was reported pharyngitis,  genital lesions and infection of the hooves which led to lameness and,  in some cases, sloughing of the hoof.<ref  name=Couch/>

More typically sheep will become free of orf within a week or so as the disease runs its course. Sheep  custodians can assist by applying antibiotic sprays on to large scabs,  ensuring infected lambs receive sufficient milk and separating out the  infected stock to slow down cross-transmission to healthy animals. It is  advisable for those handling infected animals to wear disposable gloves  to prevent cross-infection  and self-infection.  Vets need to be contacted if there is a risk of misdiagnosis with  other, more serious conditions.<ref  name=Winter_Charnley/>

==In other animals==

Primarily, orf is a disease of sheep and goats although it has been reported as a natural disease in the following: [[human]]s, [[steenbok]] and [[alpaca]]s, [[chamois]] and [[Tahr|thar]], [[reindeer]], [[musk ox]], the [[dog]], the [[cat]], the [[mountain goat]], [[bighorn sheep]], [[dall sheep]], and the [[red squirrel]] .<ref name=Couch/>
