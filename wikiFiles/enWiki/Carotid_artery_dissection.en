'''Carotid artery dissection''' is a separation of the layers of the artery wall supplying oxygen-bearing blood to the head and brain, and is the most common cause of [[stroke]] in young adults.<ref name="Amal Mattu; Deepi Goyal; Barrett, Jeffrey W.; Joshua Broder; DeAngelis, Michael; Peter Deblieux; Gus M.

==Signs and symptoms==

The signs and symptoms of carotid artery dissection may be divided into [[ischaemic]] and non-ischaemic categories:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kerry | first1 = R | last2 = Taylor | first2 = AJ | title = Cervical arterial dysfunction assessment and manual therapy | journal = Manual therapy | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 243–53 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17074613  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | doi=10.1016/j.math.2006.09.006}}</ref>

''Non-ischaemic signs and symptoms''

* Headache or neck pain
* Decreased pupil size with drooping of the upper eyelid ([[Horner syndrome]])

''Ischaemic signs and symptoms''

* Transient vision loss
* Ischaemic stroke

== Causes ==

The causes of internal carotid artery dissection can be broadly categorised into two classes: spontaneous or traumatic.

=== Spontaneous ===

Once considered uncommon, spontaneous carotid artery dissection is an increasingly recognised cause of stroke that preferentially affects the middle-aged.<ref>In: Neurology 2006;67:1809-1812. {{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00127893-199703000-00005 | last1 = Mokri | first1 = B. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1997 | title = Spontaneous dissections of internal carotid arteries | url = | journal = Neurologist | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 104–119 }}</ref>

The incidence of spontaneous carotid artery dissection is low, and incidence rates for internal carotid artery dissection have been reported to be 2.6 to 2.9 per 100,000.<ref name="Lee2006">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000244486.30455.71 | last1 = Lee | first1 = VH | author-separator =, | last2 = Brown Jr | author-name-separator=  | first2 = RD| year = 2006 | last3 = Mandrekar | first3 = JN | last4 = Mokri | first4 = B | title = Incidence and outcome of cervical dissection; a population-based  study | url = | journal = Neurology | volume = 67 | issue = 10| pages = 1809–1812 | pmid = 17130413 }}</ref> 

Observational studies and case reports published since the early 1980s show that patients with spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection may also have a history of stroke in their family and/or hereditary connective tissue disorders, such as [[Marfan syndrome]], [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]], autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, [[fibromuscular dysplasia]], and [[osteogenesis imperfecta]] type I.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1001/archneur.62.7.1168 | last1 = De Bray | first1 = JM | author-separator =, | last2 = Baumgartner | author-name-separator=  | first2 = RW| year = 2005 | title = History of spontaneous dissection of the cervical carotid artery | url = | journal = Arch Neurol | volume = 62 | issue = 7| pages = 1168–1170 | pmid = 16009782 }}</ref>

However, although an association with connective tissue disorders does exist, most people with spontaneous arterial dissections do not have associated connective tissue disorders. Also, the reports on the prevalence of hereditary connective tissue diseases in people with spontaneous dissections are highly variable, ranging from 0% to 0.6% in one study to 5% to 18% in another study.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

=== Traumatic ===

Carotid artery dissection is thought to be more commonly caused by severe violent trauma to the head and/or neck.  An estimated 0.67% of patients admitted to the hospital after major motor vehicle accidents were found to have blunt carotid injury, including intimal dissections, pseudoaneurysms, thromboses, or fistulas.<ref name="Blunt Carotid Injury">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00000658-199605000-00007 | last1 = Fabian | first1 = TC | author-separator =, | author-name-separator=  | last2 = Patton| year = 1996 | first2 = Joe | last3 = Croce | first3 = Martin | last4 = Minard | first4 = Gayle | last5 = Kudsk | first5 = Kenneth | last6 = Pritchard | first6 = F. | title = Blunt Carotid Injury | url = | journal = Annals of Surgery | volume = 223 | issue = 5| pages = 513–52 }}</ref> Of these, 76% had intimal dissections, pseudoaneurysms, or a combination of the two.

The probable mechanism of injury for most internal carotid injuries is rapid deceleration, with resultant hyperextension and rotation of the neck, which stretches the internal carotid artery over the upper [[cervical vertebrae]] , producing an intimal tear.<ref name="Blunt Carotid Injury"/> After such an injury, the patient may remain asymptomatic, have a hemispheric transient ischemic event, or suffer a stroke.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1583/1074-6218(1997)004<0339:TCADAP>2.0.CO;2 | last1 = Matsuura | first1 = JH | author-separator =, | author-name-separator=  | last2 = Rosenthal | first2 = D| year = 1997 | last3 = Jerius | first3 = H | last4 = Clark | first4 = MD | last5 = Owens | first5 = DS | title = Traumatic Carotid Artery Dissection and Pseudoaneurysm Treated With Endovascular Coils and Stent | url = | journal = Journal of Endovascular Surgery | volume = 4 | issue = 4| pages = 339–343 | pmid = 9418195 }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Arterial dissection of the [[carotid artery|carotid arteries]] occurs when a small tear forms in the innermost lining of the arterial wall (known as the [[tunica intima]]).  Blood is then able to enter the space between the inner and outer layers of the vessel, causing narrowing ([[stenosis]]) or complete [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]].  The stenosis that occurs in the early stages of arterial dissection is a dynamic process and some occlusions can return to stenosis very quickly.<ref name="C Lucas, 2648">{{cite journal | last1 = Lucas | first1 = C | author-separator =, | author-name-separator=  | last2 = Moulin | first2 = T| year = 1998 | last3 = Deplanque | first3 = D | last4 = Tatu | first4 = L | last5 = Chavot | first5 = D | title = Stroke patterns of internal carotid artery dissection in 40 patients | url = | journal = Stroke | volume = 29 | issue = 12| pages = 2646–2648 | pmid = 9836779 | doi = 10.1161/01.STR.29.12.2646 }}</ref>  When complete occlusion occurs, it may lead to [[ischaemia]].  Often, even a complete occlusion is totally [[asymptomatic]] because bilateral circulation keeps the brain well perfused.  However, when blood clots form and break off from the site of the tear, they form [[emboli]], which can travel through the [[arteries]] to the brain and block the blood supply to the brain, resulting in an ischaemic [[stroke]], otherwise known as a cerebral [[infarction]].  Blood clots, or emboli, originating from the dissection are thought to be the cause of infarction in the majority of cases of stroke in the presence of carotid artery dissection.<ref name="C Lucas, 2648"/>  Cerebral infarction causes irreversible damage to the brain. In one study of patients with carotid artery dissection, 60% had infarcts documented on neuroimaging.<ref name="Lee2006" />

==Treatment==
The goal of treatment is to prevent the development or continuation of neurologic deficits. Treatments include observation, [[anticoagulation]], stent implantation and carotid artery ligation.

==Epidemiology==
70% of patients with carotid arterial dissection are between the ages of 35 and 50, with a mean age of 47 years.<ref name="Amal Mattu; Deepi Goyal; Barrett, Jeffrey W.; Joshua Broder; DeAngelis, Michael; Peter Deblieux; Gus M. Garmel; Richard Harrigan; David Karras; Anita L'Italien; David Manthey 2007 46"/>
