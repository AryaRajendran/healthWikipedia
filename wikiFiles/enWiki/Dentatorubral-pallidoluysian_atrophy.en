'''Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA)''' is an [[autosomal dominant]] spinocerebellar degeneration caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat encoding a [[polyglutamine tract]] in the [[ATN1|atrophin-1]] protein.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kanazawa I |title=Molecular pathology of dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy |journal=Philos.

Although this condition was perhaps first described by Smith et al. in 1958, and several sporadic cases have been reported from Western countries, this disorder seems to be very rare except in Japan.

There are at least eight neurodegenerative diseases that are caused by expanded CAG repeats encoding polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches (see: [[Trinucleotide repeat disorder]]). The expanded CAG repeats create an adverse gain-of-function mutation in the gene products. Of these diseases, DRPLA is most similar to [[Huntington's disease]].

==Signs and symptoms==
DRPLA can be juvenile-onset (< 20 years), early adult-onset (20–40 years), or late adult-onset (> 40 years). Late adult-onset DRPLA is characterized by [[ataxia]], [[choreoathetosis]] and [[dementia]]. Early adult-onset DRPLA also includes [[seizures]] and [[myoclonus]]. Juvenile-onset DRPLA presents with ataxia and symptoms consistent with progressive myoclonus epilepsy <ref name=Tsuji1999>{{

==Pathology==
DRPLA is characterized by marked, generalized brain atrophy and the accumulation of [[ATN1|atrophin-1]] with expanded [[glutamine]] stretches. Mutant [[ATN1|atrophin-1]] proteins have been found in neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NII) and diffusely accumulated in the neuronal nuclei. While the role of NIIs (pathologic or protective) is unclear, the diffuse accumulation of mutant protein is regarded as toxic.

===Brain atrophy===
There is significant reduction in CNS tissue throughout the brain and [[spinal cord]], with brain weights of DRPLA patients often becoming less than 1000g.<ref name=Naito1982>{{

}}</ref> In regions lacking obvious neuronal depletion, atrophy of the [[neuropil]] is noted. The [[globus pallidus]] (lateral greater than medial segment) and [[subthalamic nucleus]] demonstrate consistent neuronal loss and astrocytic [[gliosis]]. The [[dentate nucleus]] shows neuronal loss with the remaining atrophic neurons exhibiting grumose degeneration. In general, the pallidoluysian degeneration is more severe than the dentatorubral degeneration in juvenile-onset and the reverse is true for the late adult-onset.<ref name=Yamada2008/> 

[[Transgenic]] DRPLA mice demonstrated several neuronal abnormalities including a reduction in the number and size of [[dendritic spine]]s as well as in the area of [[perikarya]] and diameter of [[dendrites]].<ref name=Sakai2006/> Spine morphology and density have been linked to learning and memory functions as well as [[epilepsy]]. The stubby-type spines seen in DRPLA mice are morphologically different from the thin and mushroom-type spines seen in [[Huntington's disease|Huntington’s]] mice. 

Morphometric analysis of DRPLA mouse brains has shown a loss of normal inter-microtubule spacing in neuronal axons. The [[microtubules]] were relatively compacted, suggesting abnormalities in protein transport may play a role in neuronal degeneration.<ref name=Sakai2006/> In humans, [[ATN1|atrophin-1]] interacts with IRSp53, which interacts with [[Rho family of GTPases|Rho GTPases]] to regulate the organization of the actin [[cytoskeleton]] and the pathways that regulate [[lamellipodia]] and [[filopodia]].<ref name=Mackie2005>{{

NIIs have also been demonstrated to alter the distribution of the intranuclear structures, such as [[promyelocytic leukemia protein]] (PML) nuclear bodies. Although the role of PML bodies is unclear, they are believed to be involved in [[apoptosis]].

===Diffuse accumulation in the nuclei===
In DRPLA, diffuse accumulation of mutant [[ATN1]] occurs far more extensively than NII formation. The extent and frequency of neurons showing the diffuse nuclear accumulations changes depending on CAG repeat length. It is believed that the diffuse nuclear accumulations contribute to the clinical features such as [[dementia]] and [[epilepsy]].

ATN1 contains both a nuclear localization sequence and a nuclear export sequence. Cleavage of ATN1 to an N terminal fragment relieves ATN1 of its nuclear export signal and concentrates it in the nucleus. Increased nuclear concentrations have been demonstrated via transfection assay to enhance cellular toxicity.<ref name=Nucifora2003/>

In both the juvenile and adult forms, regions in which more than 40% of neurons became immunoreactive to 1C2 (a [[Monoclonal antibodies|monoclonal antibody]] against expanded polyglutamine stretches) included: the nucleus basalis of Meynert, large striatal neurons, [[globus pallidus]], [[subthalamic nucleus]], thalamic [[intralaminar nucleus]], [[lateral geniculate body]], [[oculomotor nucleus]], [[red nucleus]], [[substantia nigra]], [[trigeminal motor nucleus]], [[nucleus raphe pontis]], [[pontine nuclei]], [[vestibular nucleus]], [[inferior olive]] and the cerebellar [[dentate nucleus]]. The juvenile type also shows reactivity in the [[cerebral cortex]], [[hippocampal]] CA1 area, and the [[reticular formation]] of the brainstem.<ref name=Yamada2008/> Nuclei containing accumulations of mutant [[ATN1|atrophin-1]] are deformed with nuclear membrane indentations.<ref name=Takahashi2001>{{

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of DRPLA rests of positive family history, clinical findings, and [[genetic testing]]. Family history can be difficult to obtain if a relative was misdiagnosed, died young, or experiences late onset of symptoms.

Other diseases in the [[differential diagnosis]] of adult-onset DRPLA include [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's]] and the [[spinocerebellar ataxias]]. For juvenile-onset, familial essential myoclonus and epilepsy (FEME), [[Lafora disease|Lafora]], [[Unverricht-Lundborg disease|Unverricht-Lundborg]], Neuroaxonal dystrophy, [[Gaucher's disease]], [[Sialidosis]], and Galactosialidosis.

==Management==
To quantify the extent of the disease, an [[MRI]], [[EEG]] and neuropsychological testing are recommended. Seizures are treated with anticonvulsants and psychiatric disturbances with psychotropic medications.

==Epidemiology==
The prevalence of DRPLA in the Japanese population is believed to be 0.2-0.7 in 100,000. DRPLA is observed relatively less frequently in other ethnic populations and an analysis of normal [[ATN1]] alleles has demonstrated that CAG repeat length greater than 17 are significantly more frequent in the Japanese population.<ref name=Burke1994>{{
