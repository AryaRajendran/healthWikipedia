'''Ralph Bathurst''' (1620 – June 14, 1704) was an [[England|English]] [[theologian]] and [[physician]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Hothorpe]], [[Northamptonshire]] in 1620 and educated at [[King Henry VIII School, Coventry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thepeerage.com/p11814.htm#i118139 |title=Person Page 11814 |publisher=thePeerage.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref>

He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree from [[Trinity College, Oxford]] in 1638, where he had a family connection with the President, [[Ralph Kettell]] (1563–1643).<ref name = Pyle>[[Andrew Pyle (philosopher)|Andrew Pyle]] (editor), ''Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers'' (2000), pp. 74–75.</ref>

==Oxford science and medicine==
He originally intended a career in the [[Church of England]], and was ordained in 1644, but his prospects were disrupted by the [[English Civil War]], and he turned to [[medicine]]. He collaborated with [[Thomas Willis]], and worked on rewriting Willis's major publication ''Cerebri Anatomi''.<ref name = Pyle/>

Bathurst was active in the intellectual ferment of the time, and very well connected. In the account given by [[John Wallis]] of the precursor groups to the [[Royal Society of London]], Bathurst is mentioned as one of the [[Oxford experimentalists]] who gathered from 1648–9. Also in that group were Willis, [[William Petty]] and [[Seth Ward (bishop)|Seth Ward]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110629013647/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1662royalsociety.html Modern History Sourcebook: Dr. John Wallis: The Origin of The Royal Society, 1645–1662]. fordham.edu</ref> The group expanded in the 1650s when it gathered around [[John Wilkins]] of [[Wadham College]], close however to [[Oliver Cromwell]], and then included also [[Jonathan Goddard]], [[Thomas Millington (physician)|Thomas Millington]], [[Laurence Rooke]], and [[Christopher Wren]].<ref>[[Lisa Jardine]], ''The Curious Life of Robert Hooke'' (2003), p. 69.</ref> Later [[Robert Boyle]] joined.

Bathurst belonged also to the overlapping circle of physicians following the tradition of [[William Harvey]], and which included again Willis, [[George Ent]] , [[Walter Charleton]], [[Nathaniel Highmore (physician)|Nathaniel Highmore]], and [[Charles Scarburgh]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.she-philosopher.com/ib/bios/holder.html |title=BIOGRAPHIES: Susan Holder (16271688) |publisher=She-philosopher.com |date=2009-09-27 |accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref> these were [[Cavalier|royalists]] who had attended [[Charles I of England]].<ref>Lisa Jardine, ''On a Grander Scale'' (2002), p. 54 ISBN 006095910X.</ref> In the celebrated case of [[Anne Greene]], who survived a hanging, the physicians intending to dissect the cadaver were Bathurst, Petty, Willis, and [[Henry Clerke]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Jane Shaw|title=Miracles in Enlightenment England|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4_UXe_Cat7wC&pg=PA58|accessdate=10 May 2012|date=13 November 2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-11272-6|pages=58–}}</ref>

He worked in practical medicine under the physician [[Daniel Whistler]] (1619–1684). This was during the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] of 1652 to 1654, when Whistler was in charge of wounded naval personnel.<ref name = Pyle/> He theorised fruitfully in 1654 on [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]], in a dissertation for his higher medical degree, and his ideas were later taken up, by Boyle and [[John Mayow]].<ref name = Pyle/><ref>Nicholas Tyacke, ''The History of the University of Oxford: Volume IV: Seventeenth-Century Oxford'', Oxford University Press, USA (1984), p. 15 ISBN 0199510148.</ref>

==Later life==
On the [[English Restoration]] in 1660 he reverted to a career in the church. There is a story that he had acted as archdeacon and deputy to [[Robert Skinner]], [[Bishop of Oxford]], who was imprisoned by the Parliamentarians.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090410071012/http://www.ray-jones.org.uk/stories.htm Some stories and notes]. ray-jones.org.uk</ref>  He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1663, and was made President of Trinity College in 1664, where he initiated building work to designs by [[Christopher Wren]], a personal friend.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090322012857/http://www.trinity.ox.ac.uk/college/history/ A Historical Guide]. Trinity College Oxford</ref> He also swayed [[Samuel Parker (English bishop)|Samuel Parker]] from [[Presbyterian]] views to an Anglican outlook.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan Bruce Parkin|title=Science, Religion, and Politics in Restoration England: Richard Cumberland's De Legibus Naturae|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H6hH2ZwudCMC&pg=PA37|accessdate=10 May 2012|year=1999|publisher=Boydell & Brewer Ltd|isbn=978-0-86193-241-2|pages=37–}}</ref>

In 1670, he was [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[Wells Cathedral]].
