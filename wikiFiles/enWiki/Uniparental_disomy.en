'''Uniparental disomy''' ('''UPD''') occurs when a person receives two copies of a [[chromosome]], or of part of a chromosome, from one parent and no copies from the other parent.<ref name="pmid10797485">{{cite journal |author=Robinson WP |title=Mechanisms leading to uniparental disomy and their clinical consequences |journal=Bioessays |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=452–9 |year=2000 |month=May |pmid=10797485 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(200005)22:5<452::AID-BIES7>3.0.CO;2-K}}</ref> UPD can be the result of heterodisomy, in which a pair of non-identical chromosomes are inherited from one parent (an earlier stage [[meiosis I]] error) or isodisomy, in which a single chromosome from one parent is duplicated (a later stage [[meiosis II]] error).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Human Molecular Genetics 3|publisher=Garland Science|isbn=0-8153-4183-0|pages=58}}</ref>  Because it may lead to the duplication of lethal [[recessive]] genes, isodisomy is potentially dangerous, while heterodisomy is essentially benign.

==Pathophysiology==
UPD can occur as a random event during the formation of [[Ovum|egg]] or [[sperm]] cells or may happen in early [[fetus|fetal]] development. It can also occur during [[trisomic rescue]]. 

* When the child receives two (different) ''[[homologous chromosomes]]'' (inherited from both grandparents) from one parent, this is called an '''heterodisomic''' UPD. [[Heterodisomy]] ([[heterozygous]]) indicates a [[Meiosis#Meiosis I|meiosis I]] error.
* When the child receives two (identical) replica copies of a single ''homolog'' of a [[chromosome]], this is called an '''isodisomic''' UPD. [[Isodisomy]] ([[homozygous]]) indicates either a [[Meiosis#Meiosis II|meiosis II]] or [[postzygotic]] [[chromosomal duplication]].

==Phenotype==
Most occurrences of UPD result in no [[phenotypical]] anomalies. However, if the UPD causing event happens during [[meiosis]] II, the [[genotype]] may include identical copies of the uniparental chromosome (isodisomy), leading to the manifestation of rare [[recessive]] disorders. UPD should be suspected in an individual manifesting a recessive disorder, where only one parent is a [[Genetic carrier|carrier]].

Uniparental [[Biological inheritance|inheritance]] of [[Imprinting (genetics)|imprinted]] genes can also result in [[phenotypical]] anomalies.  Though few imprinted genes have been identified, uniparental inheritance of an imprinted gene can result in the loss of gene function which can lead to delayed development, mental retardation, or other medical problems.

* The most well-known conditions include [[Prader-Willi syndrome]] and [[Angelman syndrome]]. Both of these disorders can be caused by UPD or other errors in imprinting involving genes on the long arm of [[chromosome 15]].<ref name="OMIM">[http://omim.org/entry/105830], Angelman Syndrome, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man</ref>
* Other conditions, such as [[Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome]], are associated with abnormalities of imprinted genes on the short arm of [[chromosome 11]].
* [[Chromosome 14]] is also known to cause particular symptoms such as skeletal abnormalities, [[mental retardation]] and joint contractures among others.<ref>{{OMIM2|608149}}</ref><ref>{{DiseasesDB2|32320}}</ref>

==All chromosomes (uniparental diploidy)==
Occasionally, all chromosomes will be inherited from one parent, due to either a sperm fertilizing an empty egg and duplicating itself, or a diploid egg that is not fertilized. The effect is similar to [[triploidy]], with either a [[molar pregnancy]] with no embryo if only paternal genes are present, or an embryo with no placenta if only maternal genes are present.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}  Neither condition ever results in a liveborn infant.

==History==
The first clinical case of UPD was reported in 1988 and involved a girl with [[cystic fibrosis]] and unusually short stature who carried two copies of maternal [[chromosome 7]].<ref>{{Cite journal| journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |title=Uniparental disomy as a mechanism for human genetic disease |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=217–226 |year=1988 |doi= |pmid=2893543 |author=Spence JE, Perciaccante RG, Greig GM, Willard HF, Ledbetter DH, Hejtmancik JF, Pollack MS, O'Brien WE, Beaudet AL| pmc=1715272}}</ref> Since 1991, out of the 47 possible disomies, 29 have been identified among individuals ascertained for medical reasons. This includes [[chromosome]]s 2, 5–11, 13–16, 21 and 22.
