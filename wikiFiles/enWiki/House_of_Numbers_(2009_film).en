'''''House of Numbers''''' is a controversial 2009 [[documentary film]] about [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) and [[acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]] (AIDS) produced and directed by Brent Leung.<ref name=Baywindows>{{cite news | url = http://baywindows.com/crazy-house-90259 | work = [[Bay Windows]] | first = Ethan | last = Jacobs | date = April 22, 2009 | accessdate= September 8, 2009 | title = Crazy 'House'}}</ref> Leung describes the film as an objective examination of the idea that HIV causes AIDS.<ref name=Baywindows /> The film's claims of impartiality have generally been rejected by reviewers, who have dismissed the film as [[AIDS denialism]] and [[conspiracy theory]] disguised as objective examination.<ref name="nyt" /><ref name="lancet">{{cite journal | journal = Lancet Infect Dis | title = House of Numbers | volume = 9 | issue = 12 | year = 2009 | pages = 735 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70316-0 | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2809%2970316-0/fulltext | author = Burki T}}</ref><ref name="Aaronovitch">{{cite news|title=A Conspiracy-Theory Theory.

In the film, Leung interviews a range of scientists and AIDS denialists, including [[Christine Maggiore]], an HIV-positive denialist whose 3-year-old daughter died of untreated AIDS. Maggiore herself died with [[pneumonia]] and several AIDS-related infections several months before the film's release, although her death is only mentioned in small print in the closing credits along with a claim that it was "unrelated to HIV."<ref name="lancet"/> A group of scientists interviewed for the film later complained that they had been interviewed under false pretenses, and that the film promotes [[pseudoscience]].<ref name="nyt"/>

== Critical reception ==

===Reviewers===
The film's promotion of AIDS denialism rendered it controversial and "bitterly divisive".<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.nashvillescene.com/2009-04-30/film/for-the-nashville-film-festival-there-s-clearly-life-after-forty/ | work = [[Nashville Scene]] | first = Jim | last = Ridley | date = April 29, 2009 | accessdate = September 8, 2009 | title = For the Nashville Film Festival, there's clearly life after 40}}</ref> A [[KDVR|Denver Fox affiliate TV station]] described the film as poorly organized and unfocused, but presenting "a barrage of intriguing theories."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kdvr.com/entertainment/la-et-capsules21-2009aug21,0,6959533.story | publisher = [[KDVR]] | title = Capsule movie reviews | date = August 21, 2009 | accessdate = September 8, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Promotional material for the [[Raindance Film Festival]] described the film as raising "a number of challenging and disturbing thoughts."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raindance.org/site/index.php?id=401,4439,0,0,1,0&highlight=house%20numbers |title=Raindance Film Festival |accessdate=2010-01-15 }}</ref>

The ''[[New York Times]]'' was more critical, describing the film as "a weaselly support pamphlet for AIDS denialists", "willfully ignorant", and "a globe-trotting pseudo-investigation that should raise the hackles of anyone with even a glancing knowledge of the basic rules of reasoning."<ref name="nyt">{{cite news |first=Jeanette |last= Catsoulis |title=AIDS Seen From a Different Angle  |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/09/04/movies/04house.html |work = [[New York Times]]  |date=4 September 2009  |accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref> ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' cited the film as part of "this season's fashion in conspiracy theories."<ref name="Aaronovitch"/> The ''[[Portland Oregonian]]'' criticized Leung for "not being entirely honest with viewers," and decried the film's reliance on "selective editing, anomalies and anecdotes, unsupported conclusions... and suppression of inconvenient facts."<ref name="oregonian">{{cite news | work = [[Portland Oregonian]] | publisher = OregonLive.com | first = Stan | last = Hall | title = 'House of Numbers' blurs facts on HIV | url = http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/index.ssf/2010/01/review_house_of_numbers_blurs.html | date = January 21, 2010 | accessdate = May 10, 2010}}</ref>

===Scientific community===
Reaction from the [[scientific community]] was similarly negative. ''[[The Lancet|Lancet Infectious Diseases]]'' criticized the film's arguments, calling them a "toxic combination of misrepresentation and sophistry."<ref name="lancet"/> AIDSTruth.org,<ref name=AIDSTruth>[http://www.aidstruth.org AIDSTruth.org]</ref> a website created by HIV researchers to address AIDS denialism,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cohen J |title=HIV/AIDS.

Eighteen scientists interviewed in the film state that their answers to Leung's questions were selectively [[Video editing|edited]] to convey a false sense that the scientific community disagrees on basic facts about HIV/AIDS.<ref name="lancet"/> Two interviewees, Neil Constantine and Robin Weiss, cite examples supporting the allegation that Leung misrepresented their words in a "surely intentional" manner.<ref name="WeissConstantine">{{cite web | publisher = Aidstruth.org | title = Constantine and Weiss pinpoint misrepresentations | date = November 26, 2009 | accessdate = November 27, 2009 | url = http://www.aidstruth.org/features/2009/constantine-and-weiss}}</ref>

A panel discussion of the film at a [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] film festival was disrupted by Leung and by AIDS denialists in the audience, who attempted to shout down members of the panel with whom they disagreed.<ref name="Baywindows"/>
