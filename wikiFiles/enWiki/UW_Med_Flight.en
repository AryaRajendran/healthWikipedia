==History==
The first operational flight was in April 1985 and carried a heart attack patient from [[Coloma, Wisconsin]] who survived. The initial staff was three doctors, six nurses, three pilots and one mechanic. There was no aircraft hangar and maintenance on the aircraft was performed outside with a helipad in the parking lot. There was also some controversy in nearby [[Shorewood Hills, Wisconsin]] over noise from the helicopter. 20 years later, it was staffed by a rotating crew of 23 doctors, 12 nurses, eight communications specialists and six pilots and had three helicopters and a ground ambulance.<ref>TIME-TESTED AT 20 ; FOR TWO DECADES, UW MED FLIGHT HAS TAKEN TO THE AIR TO BRING THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CARE; ELIZABETH WACHOWSKI.

On May 10, 2008, helicopter {{airreg|N|135UW}}, known as Med Flight 1, crashed near [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]], fatally injuring all three crew members.  Initial reports indicated that the helicopter "may have flown into a hill and or struck some trees."<ref>{{cite news | last=Grooms | first=Autumn | title=Three dead in Med Flight helicopter crash | publisher=La Crosse Tribune | date=2008-05-11 | url=http://www.lacrossetribune.com/articles/2008/05/11/breakingnews/03helicopter.txt | accessdate=2008-05-11 }}</ref> Impact debris and rotor blade fragments were found near the top of the 1,160 feet elevation ridgeline about 4.5 miles south of La Crosse Airport.
