'''AIDS dementia complex''' ('''ADC'''; also known as '''HIV dementia''', '''HIV encephalopathy''', '''HIV-associated dementia''' and '''HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder''') is a common neurological disorder associated with [[HIV]] [[infection]] and [[AIDS]]. It is a metabolic [[encephalopathy]] induced by [[HIV]] infection and fueled by immune activation of [[macrophage]]s and [[microglia]].<ref name=Gray>

ADC typically occurs after years of HIV infection and is associated with low CD4+ T cell levels and high plasma viral loads. It is sometimes seen as the first sign of the onset of AIDS. Prevalence is between 10-24% in Western countries<ref name=Grant>

[[Dementia]] only exists when neurocognitive impairment in the patient is severe enough to interfere markedly with day-to-day function. That is, the patient is typically unable to work and may not be able to take care of him or herself. Before this, the patient is said to have a mild neurocognitive disorder.

==Diagnostic criteria==
#Marked acquired impairment of at least two ability domains of cognitive function (e.g. memory, attention): typically, the impairment is in multiple domains, especially in learning, information processing and concentration/attention. The cognitive impairment is ascertained by [[medical history]], mental status examination or neuropsychological testing.
#Cognitive impairments identified in 1 interfere markedly with day-to-day functioning.
#Cognitive impairments identified in 1 are present for at least one month.
#Cognitive impairments identified in 1 do not meet the criteria for [[delirium]], or if delirium is present, dementia was diagnosed when delirium was not present.
#No evidence of another, pre-existing [[etiology (medicine)|aetiology]] that could explain the dementia (e.g. another CNS infection, CNS neoplasm, cerebrovascular disease, pre-existing neurological disease, severe substance abuse compatible with CNS disorder.<ref name=Atkinson>

While the progression of dysfunction is variable, it is regarded as a serious complication and untreated can progress to a fatal outcome. Diagnosis is made by [[neurologist]]s who carefully rule out alternative diagnoses. This routinely requires a careful neurological examination, brain scans ([[MRI]] or [[CT scan]]) and a [[lumbar puncture]] to evaluate the [[cerebrospinal fluid]]. No single test is available to confirm the diagnosis, but the constellation of history, laboratory findings and examination can reliably establish the diagnosis when performed by experienced clinicians. The amount of virus in the brain does not correlate well with the degree of [[dementia]], suggesting that secondary mechanisms are also important in the manifestation of ADC.

==Research==
AIDS Dementia Complex (ADC) is not a true [[opportunistic infection]]; it is one of the few conditions caused directly by HIV itself. However, the etiology of ADC can be difficult to discern because the central nervous system can be damaged by a number of other causes related to HIV infection: 
*opportunistic infections
*[[AIDS-related lymphoma|Primary cerebral lymphoma]] or [[metastasis]] of other [[AIDS-related cancer]]s
*direct effects of HIV in the brain
*toxic effects of drug treatments
*[[malnutrition]]

Many researchers believe that HIV damages the vital brain cells, [[neurons]], indirectly. According to one theory, HIV either infects or activates cells that nurture and maintain the brain, known as [[macrophages]] and [[microglia]]. These cells then produce toxins that can set off a series of reactions that instruct [[neurons]] to kill themselves. The infected macrophages and microglia also appear to produce additional factors such as [[chemokine]]s and [[cytokine]]s that can affect neurons as well as other brain cells known as [[astrocyte]]s. The affected astrocytes, which normally nurture and protect neurons, also may now end up harming neurons. HIV protein [[gp120]] inhibits the stem cells in the brain from producing new nerve cells.<ref>

==ADC stage characteristics==
*'''Stage 0''' ''(Normal)'' Normal Mental and [[motor skill|Motor Function]]
*'''Stage 0.5''' ''(Subclinical)'' Minimal symptoms of cognitive or motor dysfunction characteristic of ADC, or mild signs ([[snout reflex|snout response]], slowed extremity movements), but without impairment of work or capacity to perform activities of daily living (ADL). Gait and strength are normal.
*'''Stage 1''' ''(Mild)'' Evidence of functional intellectual or motor impairment characteristic of ADC, but able to perform all but the more demanding aspects of work or ADL. Can walk without assistance.
*'''Stage 2''' ''(Moderate)'' Cannot work or maintain the more demanding aspects of daily life, but able to perform basic activities of self care. Ambulatory, but may require a single prop.
*'''Stage 3''' ''(Severe)'' Major intellectual incapacity - cannot follow news or personal events, cannot sustain complex conversation, considerable slowing of all output. And/or motor disability - cannot walk unassisted, requiring walker or personal support, usually with slowing and clumsiness of arms as well.
*'''Stage 4''' ''(End Stage)'' Nearly vegetative. Intellectual and social comprehension and responses are at a rudimentary level. Nearly or absolutely mute. [[paraparesis|Paraparetic]] or [[paraplegic]] with [[urinary incontinence]] and [[fecal incontinence]].
