'''''Mycobacterium canettii''''', a novel pathogenic taxon of the ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' complex (MTBC), was first reported in 1969 by the French microbiologist [[Georges Canetti]] from which the organism has been named. It formed smooth and shiny colonies, which is highly exceptional for the MTBC. It was described in detail in 1997 by D van Soolingen, et al. in International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, 47, 1236-1245 owing to the isolation of a new strain from a 2-year-old Somali patient with lymphadenitis. It did not differ from ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' in the biochemical tests and in its 16S rRNA sequence. It had shorter generation time than clinical isolates of ''M. tuberculosis'' and presented a unique, characteristic phenolic glycolipid and lipo-oligosaccharide. In 1998, Pfyffer described abdominal lymphatic TB in a 56-year-old Swiss man who lived in Kenya with HIV infection. Tuberculosis caused by ''M. canettii'' appears to be an emerging disease in the Horn of Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1013–9 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2010.03347.x |title=Clinical characteristics of the smooth tubercle bacilli 'Mycobacterium canettii' infection suggest the existence of an environmental reservoir |year=2011 |last1=Koeck |first1=J.-L. |last2=Fabre |first2=M. |last3=Simon |first3=F. |last4=Daffé |first4=M. |last5=Garnotel |first5=É. |last6=Matan |first6=A.
