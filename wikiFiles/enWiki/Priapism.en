'''Priapism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|r|aɪ|ə|p|ɪ|z|əm}}<ref>''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989 as {{IPA|/'praɪəpɪz(ə)m/}}.</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/priapism Entry "priapism"] in ''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]''.</ref>)  a potentially painful medical condition, in which the [[erection|erect]] [[penis]] does not return to its flaccid state, despite the absence of both physical and psychological stimulation, within four hours. There are two types of priapism: low-flow and high-flow; 80% to 90% of clinically presented priapisms are low flow disorders.<ref name="scielo.br">PRIAPISM – ETIOLOGY, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT, C. VAN DER HORST, HENRIK STUEBINGER, CHRISTOPH SEIF, DIETHILD MELCHIOR, F.J. MARTÍNEZ-PORTILLO, K.P. JUENEMANN; http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ibju/v29n5/18554.pdf</ref> Low-flow involves the blood not adequately returning to the body from the organ. High-flow involves a short-circuit of the vascular system partway along the organ. Treatment is different for each type. Priapism is considered a [[medical emergency]], which should receive proper treatment by a qualified medical practitioner. Early treatment can be beneficial for a functional recovery.

Not all sources give four hours as the guideline for priapism occurring: "The duration time of a normal erection before it is classifiable as priapism is still controversial. Ongoing penile erections for more than 6 hours can be classified as priapism..."<ref name="scielo.br"/>

The name comes from the Greek god [[Priapus]] ({{lang-grc|Πρίαπος}}), a fertility god often represented with a disproportionately large and permanent erection.

==Causes==
The causative mechanisms are poorly understood but involve complex neurological and [[vascular]] factors. Priapism may be associated with [[hematology|haematological]] disorders, especially [[sickle-cell disease]], sickle-cell trait, and other conditions such as [[leukemia]], [[thalassemia]], and [[Fabry's disease]], and [[neurology|neurologic disorders]] such as [[spinal cord]] lesions and spinal cord trauma (priapism has been reported in hanging victims; see [[death erection]]).

Priapism may also be associated with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], which leads to decreased [[NADPH]] levels. NADPH is a co-factor involved in the formation of nitric oxide, which may result in priapism.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Finley DS | title = Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency associated stuttering priapism: report of a case | journal = [[J Sex Med]] | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = 2963–6 | year = 2008 | month = December | pmid = 18823322 | doi = 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2008.01007.x }}</ref> Raised levels of [[adenosine]] may also contribute to the condition by causing blood vessels to dilate, thus influencing blood flow into the penis.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mi T, Abbasi S, Zhang H, Uray K, Chunn JL, Xia LW, Molina JG, Weisbrodt NW, Kellems RE, Blackburn MR, Xia Y | title = Excess adenosine in murine penile erectile tissues contributes to priapism via A2B adenosine receptor signaling | journal = [[J.

Sickle cell disease often presents special treatment obstacles. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has also been used with success in some patients.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Macaluso JN | title = Priapism: Update for the non-urologist | journal = Sexual Medicine Today | volume = 9 | pages = 11–15 | year = 1985 }}</ref>
Priapism is also found to occur in extreme cases of rabies.
Priapism can also be caused by reactions to [[medication]]s.  The most common medications that cause priapism are intra-cavernous injections for treatment of [[erectile dysfunction]] ([[papaverine]], [[alprostadil]]). Other groups reported are [[antihypertensives]], [[antipsychotic]]s (e.g., [[chlorpromazine]], [[clozapine]]), [[antidepressant]]s (most notably [[trazodone]]), [[anticoagulants]], [[cantharides]] (''Spanish Fly'') and recreational drugs ([[alcohol]], [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]]).  Priapism has also been linked to [[achalasia]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Priapism is also known to occur from bites of the [[Brazilian wandering spider]] and the [[black widow spider]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}  PDE-5 inhibitors have been evaluated as preventive treatment for recurrent priapism.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Burnett AL, Bivalacqua TJ, Champion HC, Musicki B | title = Long-term oral phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor therapy alleviates recurrent priapism | journal = [[Urology]] | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 1043–8 | year = 2006 | month = May | pmid = 16698365 | doi = 10.1016/j.urology.2005.11.045 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Burnett AL, Bivalacqua TJ, Champion HC, Musicki B | title = Feasibility of the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in a pharmacologic prevention program for recurrent priapism | journal = [[J Sex Med]] | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 1077–84 | year = 2006 | month = November | pmid = 17100941 | doi = 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2006.00333.x }}</ref>

== Complications ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
Potential complications include [[ischemia]], clotting of the blood retained in the penis ([[thrombosis]]), and damage to the blood vessels of the penis which may result in an impaired erectile function or [[Erectile dysfunction|impotence]].  In serious cases, the ischemia may result in [[gangrene]], which could necessitate [[Penectomy|penis removal]].

==Treatment==

{{Refimprove section|date=March 2013}}

Medical advice should be sought immediately for cases of erection beyond four hours.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Generally, this is done at an [[emergency department]]. In [[sickle-cell anaemia]] patients with priapism, the first step in management is a blood exchange transfusion, not a surgical intervention.  For other patients, orally administered [[pseudoephedrine]] may be effective, pseudoephedrine being an [[alpha-agonist]], agent that exert a constriction effect on smooth muscle of corpora cavernosum, that in turn facilitate venous outflow. Likewise, other [[sympathomimetic]] drugs of the [[amphetamine]] class have been observed to induce erectile dysfunction, although in a small number of cases they may have the opposite effect. Otherwise, the therapy at this stage is to aspirate blood from the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]] under [[local anesthetic|local anaesthetic]]. If this is still insufficient, then [[intracavernosal injection]]s of [[phenylephrine]] are administered. This should only be performed by a specialist trained in the procedure, with the patient under constant [[hemodynamic]] monitoring, as phenylephrine can cause severe [[hypertension]], [[bradycardia]], [[tachycardia]], and [[arrhythmia]].

[[Terbutaline]] being a [[beta-2 agonist]] causes smooth muscle relaxation; in priapism it probably acts by relaxation of the stretched corporeal smooth muscles, or increasing permeability of erectile cavernous tissue permitting easy flow of fluid from sinusoids into the venous system. In priapism, it was suggested to be administered orally.<ref name="nature.com">Oral terbutaline in the management of pharmacologically induced prolonged erection, S Priyadarshi, Department of Urology, SMS Medical College & Hospital, Jaipur, India, http://www.nature.com/ijir/journal/v16/n5/pdf/3901180a.pdf</ref>

[[Methylene blue]] is used intracavernously to treat priapism, but it should not be used in treatment of recurrent priapism or fibrosis because it can induce penile necrosis. Temporary blue discoloration of the [[penis]] is also of concern.<ref name="nature.com"/>

If aspiration fails and [[tumescence]] recurs, surgical [[Shunt (medical)|shunts]] are next attempted. These attempt to reverse the priapic state by shunting blood from the rigid corpora cavernosa into the [[corpus spongiosum]] (which contains the [[Glans penis|glans]] and the [[urethra]]). Distal shunts are the first step, followed by more proximal shunts. 

Distal shunts, such as the Winter's,{{clarify|date=November 2009}} involve puncturing the glans (the distal part of the penis) into one of the cavernosa, where the old, stagnant blood is held. This causes the blood to leave the penis and return to the circulation. This procedure can be performed by a urologist at the bedside. Winter's shunts are often the first invasive technique used, especially in hematologic induced priapism, as it is relatively simple and repeatable over time.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Macaluso JN, Sullivan JW | title = Priapism: A review of 34 cases | journal = Urology | volume = 26 | pages = 233–236 | year = 1985 | doi = 10.1016/0090-4295(85)90116-5 | pmid = 4035837 | issue = 3 }}</ref>

Proximal shunts, such as the Quackel's,{{clarify|date=November 2009}} are more involved and entail operative dissection in the [[perineum]] to where the corpora meet the spongiosum, making an incision in both, and suturing both openings together.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Montague DK, Jarow J, Broderick GA, Dmochowski RR, Heaton JP, Lue TF, Nehra A, Sharlip ID | title = American Urological Association guideline on the management of priapism | journal = [[J. Urol.]] | volume = 170 | issue = 4 Pt 1 | pages = 1318–24 | year = 2003 | month = October | pmid = 14501756 | doi = 10.1097/01.ju.0000087608.07371.ca }}</ref> 

Shunts created between corpora cavernosa and saphenous vein called Grayhack shunt can be done though rarely.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

As the complication of shortened, indurated and non-erectile penis is high in prolonged priapism, early penile prosthesis implantation can be performed. Apart from early resumption of sexual activity, early implantation can avoid the formation of dense fibrosis and hence a shortened penis.
