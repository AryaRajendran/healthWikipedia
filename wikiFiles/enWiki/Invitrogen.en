'''Invitrogen Corporation''' (was traded as {{NASDAQ|IVGN}}) was a large, multinational biotechnology company headquartered in Carlsbad, California. In November 2008, a merger between [[Applied Biosystems]] and Invitrogen<ref>[http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/corporate/Investor-Relations/Invitrogen-News.html?CID=fl-tellmemore].</ref> was finalized. The new company is called [[Life Technologies]] (now traded as {{NASDAQ|LIFE}}) .

==History==
===Founding===
Invitrogen was founded in 1987 by Lyle Turner, Joe Fernandez, and William McConnell and was incorporated in 1989. The company initially found success with its kits for molecular [[cloning]]—notably, The Librarian, a kit for making [[cDNA]] libraries, and the FastTrack Kit for [[mRNA]] isolation from biological samples.

William McConnell left the company in 1989.

In 1999, the company, which had reached sales of $33 million the prior year, went public, with a plan of consolidating biotechnology research boutique suppliers. The company had become quite successful at licensing technologies into its niche market, of cloning and expression, but determined that many niche leaders were not interested in licensing, and M&A needed to be added to the companies set of tools for growth.

===Mergers and acquisitions===
Invitrogen acquired Novatech, a leader in cloned protein characterization, within 60 days of going public. Then purchased ResGen, a leader in genomics and synthetic DNA chemistry, becoming a $100 million (annual sales) company within a year of its IPO.

The business scope expanded significantly when it acquired the rival [[biotechnology]] and [[cell culture]] company Life Technologies/GIBCO in 2000. Since then, the company has continued to add technologies through a series of mergers and acquisitions, which have broadened its customer base and strengthened its intellectual property portfolio. Among these, established companies such as Ethrog Biotechnology, Molecular Probes ([[fluorescence]]-based detection),  Dynal (magnetic bead–based separation), Panvera (proteins and assays for [[drug screening]]), InforMax (software for computational biology and bioinformatics), BioSource (cellular pathway analysis), CellzDirect (cell products and services for research) and Zymed and Caltag Laboratories (primary and secondary [[antibodies]]) have been brought under the Invitrogen brand.  

In 2008, Invitrogen virtually doubled its size with the purchase of biotech instrumentation company [[Applied Biosystems]], maker of DNA sequencing and PCR machines and reagents.  The company then renamed the overall organization as Life Technologies.  The Invitrogen brand and most of the brands acquired still exist on product packaging, although the overall company is called Life Technologies.  In summer 2010, the company acquired the computer chip DNA sequencing company Ion Torrent Systems.  Through this history of acquisitions and continued product research and development, Invitrogen / Life Technologies now has over 50,000 products.

==Portfolio==
===Key products and technologies===
Utilizing this business strategy, Invitrogen now represents a large number of products: [[Dynabeads]] magnetic separation technology, GIBCO cell culture media and reagents, SuperScript [[reverse transcriptase]], Platinum [[Taq polymerase]], [[TOPO Cloning|TOPO cloning]] and expression products, Novex protein [[gel electrophoresis|electrophoresis]] products, and numerous fluorescent reagents such as [[quantum dot|Qdot nanocrystals]] and [[Alexa Fluor]] and [[SYBR Green|SYBR]] dyes. Invitrogen currently offers more than 25,000 products and services to support research in cellular analysis, [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], and [[drug discovery]], and has sought to leverage their extensive technology portfolio to address research problems in developing fields, including [[biodefense]] and environmental diagnostics, [[bioinformatics]], [[epigenetics]], and [[stem cell]] research.

===Innovation and impact===
Under a contract from the [[Dtra|Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)]], the company developed a prototype hand-held [[pathogen]] detection system for the detection of multiple toxins such as [[ricin]], [[staphylococcal enterotoxin]], and [[botulinum toxin]], as well as bacteria that cause [[anthrax]], [[Plague (disease)|plague]], and other diseases, in a single sample.<ref>Invitrogen Delivers Prototype Handheld Biothreat Detector [http://www.zibb.com/article/1551632/Invitrogen+Delivers+Prototype+Handheld+Biothreat+Detector].</ref> Invitrogen was also awarded a contract to provide kits for detecting possible ''[[E. coli]]'' O157 contamination in food at the [[2008 Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]].{{Fact|date=January 2008}} The monitoring program, based on [[World Health Organization]] food standards, is conducted by the Beijing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Olympic Food Safety program. Similarly, the company's PathAlert technology was selected to monitor ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', the causative agent of the plague, at the [[Torino Winter Games in 2006]]. Their Qubit platform for RNA, DNA, and protein quantitation was awarded an [[R&D 100 Award]] as being a "Top 100 Technologically Significant New Product" by [http://www.rdmag.com/ ''R&D Magazine''].<ref>Invitrogen's Qubit Platform Wins 2007 R&D 100 Award [http://www.genengnews.com/news/bnitem.aspx?name=21819576&taxid=17].</ref> 

Invitrogen develops and introduces [[stem cell]] products. Among more than 1,200 products for stem cell research, the company offers an engineered stem cell line (BG01v/hOG) and various STEMPRO products for manual passaging of human embryonic stem cells (hESC), to promote hESC growth and expansion, and to allow scientists to ascertain hESC [[pluripotency]].

===Customer resources===
Invitrogen offers as online resources the [http://www.invitrogen.com/linnea/ Linnea Online Guides] and ''[http://probes.invitrogen.com/handbook/ The Handbook—A Guide to Fluorescent Probes and Labeling Technologies]''. Linnea guides provide researchers with free access to research protocols, product selection and design tools, pathway maps, and gene information. Now in its tenth edition, ''The Handbook'' is designed as a reference for fluorescence detection technology and its application.
