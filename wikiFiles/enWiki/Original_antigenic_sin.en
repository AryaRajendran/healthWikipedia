[[File:Original Antigenic Sin.jpg|thumb|400px|'''The original antigenic sin:''' When the body first encounters an infection it produces effective antibodies against its '''dominant [[antigen]]s''' and thus eliminates the infection. But when it encounters the same infection, at a later evolved stage, with a '''new dominant antigen''', with the original antigen now being recessive, the immune system will still produce the former antibodies against this old " now recessive antigen" and not develop new antibodies against the new dominant one, this results in the production of ineffective antibodies and thus a weak immunity.]]

'''Original antigenic sin''', also known as the '''Hoskins effect''',<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/01/transcripts/3769t1.rtf FDA Center for Biologics Evaluaion and Research Vaccines and Related Biological Products: Advisory Committee]([[Rich Text Format|RTF]]) </ref> refers to the propensity of the body's [[immune system]] to preferentially utilize [[immunity (medical)|immunological memory]] based on a previous [[infection]] when a second slightly different version, of that foreign entity (e.g. a [[virus]] or [[bacterium]]) is encountered.  This leaves the immune system "trapped" by the first response it has made to each [[antigen]], and unable to mount potentially more effective responses during subsequent infections. The phenomenon of original antigenic sin has been described in relation to [[influenza virus]], [[dengue fever]], [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV), and to several other viruses.<ref>Deem, Michael W.[http://www.mwdeem.rice.edu/mwdeem/ ''The Adaptive Immune Response''] Rice University</ref>

This phenomenon was first described in 1960 by Thomas Francis, Jr. in the article "On the Doctrine of Original Antigenic Sin".<ref name=Francis>Thomas Francis, Jr. (Dec. 15, 1960).

"The swine flu episode and the fog of epidemics". ''Emerg Infect Dis'' 12(1): 40-43, PMID 16494715.</ref>  It is named by analogy to the [[theological]] concept of [[original sin]]. According to Thomas Francis who originally described the idea <ref name=Francis /> and cited by Richard Krause:<ref name=Krause />

<blockquote>"The antibody of childhood is largely a response to dominant antigen of the virus causing the first type A influenza infection of the lifetime. [...] The imprint established by the original virus infection governs the antibody response thereafter. This we have called the Doctrine of the Original Antigenic Sin."</blockquote>

==In B cells== 
[[Image:Original antigenic sin.svg|thumb|200px|right|A high affinity memory B cell, specific for Virus A, is preferentially activated by a new strain, Virus A<sup>1</sup>, to produce antibodies that ineffectively bind to the A<sup>1</sup> strain. The presence of these antibodies inhibits activation of a naive B cell that produces more effective antibodies against Virus A<sup>1</sup>. This effect leads to a diminished immune response against Virus A<sup>1</sup>, and heightens the potential for serious infection.]]

During a primary [[infection]], long-lived [[memory B cell]]s are generated, which remain in the body, and provide protection from subsequent infections.  These memory B cells respond to specific [[epitopes]] on the surface of viral proteins in order to produce antigen-specific [[antibodies]], and are able to respond to infection much faster than B cells are able to respond to novel antigens. This effect shortens the amount of time required to clear subsequent infections.

Between primary and secondary infections, or following [[vaccination]], a virus may undergo [[antigenic drift]], in which the viral surface proteins (the epitopes) are altered through natural mutation, allowing the virus to escape the immune system. When this happens, the altered virus preferentially reactivates previously activated high-affinity memory B cells and spur antibody production.  However, the antibodies produced by these B cells generally ineffectively bind to the altered [[epitopes]]. In addition, these antibodies inhibit the activation of lower-affinity naive [[B cells]] that ''would'' be able to make more effective antibodies to the second virus.  This leads to a less effective immune response and recurrent infections may take longer to clear.<ref name=Lambert>Lambert PH, Liu M, Siegrist CA (2005).

Original antigenic sin is of particular importance in the application of [[vaccines]].<ref name=Choi>{{cite journal|coauthors=Yoon Seok Choi, Yun Hee Baek, Wonseok Kang, Seung Joo Nam, Jino Lee, Sooseong You, Dong-Yeop Chang, Jong-Chan Youn, Young Ki Choi, Eui-Cheol Shin|title=Reduced Antibody Responses to the Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Vaccine after Recent Seasonal Influenza Vaccination|journal=Clinical and Vaccine Immunology|year=2011|month=September|volume=18|issue=9|pages=1519–1523|doi=10.1128/CVI.05053-11|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165229/|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref> In [[dengue fever]], the effect of original antigenic sin has important implications for vaccine development. Once a response against a dengue virus serotype has been established, it is unlikely that vaccination against a second will be effective, implying that balanced responses against all four virus serotypes have to be established with the first vaccine dose.<ref name=Midgley>{{cite journal|last=Midgley|first=Claire|coauthors=Claire M.

The  specificity and the quality of the immune response against novel strains of influenza is often diminished in individuals who are repeatedly immunized (by vaccination or recurrent infections).<ref name=Kim>{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=J.H.|coauthors=Skountzou I., Compans R., Jacob J.|title=Original antigenic sin responses to influenza viruses.|journal=Journal of Immunology|date=1 September 2009|volume=183|issue=5|pages=3294–301|doi=10.4049/jimmunol.0900398|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19648276/|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref> However, the impact of antigenic sin on protection has not been well established, and appears to differ with each infectious agent vaccine, geographic location, and age.<ref name=Lambert/> Researchers found reduced antibody responses to the [[2009 flu pandemic|2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza]] [[2009 flu pandemic vaccine|vaccine]] in individuals who had been vaccinated against the seasonal A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1) within the previous three months.<ref name=Choi />

==In cytotoxic T cells==
A similar phenomenon has been described in [[cytotoxic T cells]] (CTL).<ref name=McMichael>McMichael AJ (1998). "The original sin of killer T cells". ''Nature'' 394(6692): 421-422, PMID 9697760, {{DOI|10.1038/28738}}.</ref> Several groups have attempted to design [[vaccine]]s for HIV and [[hepatitis C]] based on induction of [[cytotoxic]] (CTL) responses. The finding that CTL may be biased by original antigenic sin, may help to explain the limited effectiveness of these vaccines. Viruses like HIV are highly variable and undergo mutation frequently, and thus, due to original antigenic sin, HIV infection induced by viruses that express slightly different epitopes (than those in a viral vaccine) would fail to be controlled by the vaccine. In fact, the vaccine might make the infection even worse, by "trapping" the immune response into the first, ineffective, response it made against the virus.<ref name=McMichael/>
