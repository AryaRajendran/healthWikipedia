:''This page is the redirect for portal vein. For a vein that connects two systems of capillary beds see [[portal venous system]].''
The '''hepatic portal vein''' is a [[blood vessel]] that conducts blood from the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and [[spleen]] to the [[liver]]. This blood is rich in nutrients that were extracted from food, and the liver processes these nutrients; it also filters toxins that may have been ingested with the food. The liver receives about 75% of its blood through the hepatic portal vein, with the remainder coming from the [[hepatic artery proper]]. The blood leaves the liver to the heart in the [[hepatic veins]].

The hepatic portal vein is not a true [[vein]], because it conducts blood to [[capillary]] beds in the liver and not directly to the heart. It is a major component of the [[hepatic portal system]], one of only two [[portal venous system]]s in the body. The other is the [[hypophyseal portal system]].

The hepatic portal vein is usually formed by the confluence of the [[superior mesenteric vein|superior mesenteric]] and [[splenic vein]]s and also receives blood from the [[inferior mesenteric vein|inferior mesenteric]], [[gastric vein (disambiguation)|gastric]], and [[cystic vein]]s. 

Conditions involving the hepatic portal vein cause considerable illness and death. An important example of such a condition is elevated [[blood pressure]] in the hepatic portal vein. This condition, called [[portal hypertension]], is a major complication of [[cirrhosis]].

In most individuals, the hepatic portal vein is formed by the union of the [[superior mesenteric vein]] and the [[splenic vein]].<ref name="isbn1-55009-364-9">{{cite book |author=Benjamin L. Shneider; Sherman, Philip M. |title=Pediatric Gastrointestinal Disease |publisher=PMPH-USA |location=Connecticut |year=2008 |pages=751 |isbn=1-55009-364-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> For this reason, the hepatic portal vein is occasionally called the '''''splenic-mesenteric confluence'''''.<ref name="phtn">{{cite book |author=Plinio Rossi; L.

Other tributaries of the hepatic portal vein include the [[cystic vein|cystic]] and [[gastric veins]].<ref name="grays"/>

Immediately before reaching the liver, the portal vein divides into right and left. It ramifies further, forming smaller venous branches and ultimately portal venules. Each portal venule courses alongside a hepatic arteriole and the two vessels form the vascular components of the [[portal triad]]. These vessels ultimately empty into the [[hepatic sinusoid]]s to supply blood to the liver.<ref name="grays"/>

===Portacaval anastomoses===
The [[portal venous system]] has several [[anastomoses]] with the [[systemic venous system]].  In cases of [[portal hypertension]] these anastamoses may become engorged, dilated, or varicosed and subsequently rupture.

===Accessory hepatic portal veins===
Accessory hepatic portal veins are those veins that drain directly into the liver without joining the hepatic portal vein. These include the [[paraumbilical vein]]s as well as veins of the [[lesser omentum]], [[falciform ligament]], and those draining the [[gallbladder]] wall.<ref name="phtn"/>

==Physiology==
The hepatic portal vein and [[hepatic arteries]] form the liver's dual blood supply. Approximately 75% of hepatic blood flow is derived from the hepatic portal vein, while the remainder is from the hepatic arteries.<ref name="phtn"/>

Unlike most veins, the hepatic portal vein does not drain into the [[heart]]. Rather, it is part of a [[portal venous system]] that delivers venous blood into another [[capillary system]], namely the [[hepatic sinusoid]]s of the liver. In carrying venous blood from the gastrointestinal tract to the liver, the hepatic portal vein accomplishes two tasks; namely, it supplies the liver with metabolic substrates and it ensures that substances ingested are first processed by the liver before reaching the [[systemic circulation]]. This accomplishes two things.  First, possible toxins that may be ingested can be detoxified by the hepatocytes before they are released into the systemic circulation.  Second, the liver is the first organ to absorb nutrients just taken in by the intestines.  After draining into the liver sinusoids, blood from the liver is drained by the [[hepatic vein]].

Increased [[blood pressure]] in the portal vein, called [[portal hypertension]], is a major complication of liver disease, most commonly [[cirrhosis]].<ref name="isbn0-632-05582-0">{{cite book |author=Dooley, James; Sherlock, Sheila |title=Diseases of the liver and biliary system |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Oxford |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-632-05582-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Stigmata of portal hypertension include those of chronic liver disease: [[ascites]], [[esophageal varices]], [[spider nevi]], [[caput medusae]], and [[palmar erythema]].<ref name="isbn1-85996-164-9">{{cite book |author= |title=Key Topics in General Surgery |publisher=Informa Healthcare |location= |year=2002 |pages= |edition=2 |isbn=1-85996-164-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>
