A '''glioma''' is a type of [[tumor]] that starts in the brain or spine. It is called a glioma because it arises from [[glial cell]]s.  The most common site of gliomas is the [[brain tumor|brain]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mamelak AN, Jacoby DB |title=Targeted delivery of antitumoral therapy to glioma and other malignancies with synthetic chlorotoxin (TM-601) |journal=Expert Opin Drug Deliv |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=175–86 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17335414 |doi=10.1517/17425247.4.2.175 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1517/17425247.4.2.175}}</ref> Gliomas make up ~30% of all brain and central nervous system tumors and 80% of all malignant brain tumors.<ref name=Goodenberger2012>{{cite journal | author = Goodenberger ML, Jenkins RB | year = 2012 | title = Genetics of adult glioma | url = | journal = Cancer Genet | volume =  | issue = | page = | doi = 10.1016/j.cancergen.2012.10.009 }}</ref>

==Classification==

Gliomas are classified by cell type, by grade, and by location.

===By type of cell===
Gliomas are named according to the specific type of cell they share histological features with, but not necessarily originate from. The main types of gliomas are:

* [[Ependymoma]]s—[[ependymal cell]]s.
* [[Astrocytoma]]s—[[astrocyte]]s ([[glioblastoma multiforme]] is the most common astrocytoma).
* [[Oligodendroglioma]]s—[[oligodendrocyte]]s.
* Mixed gliomas, such as [[oligoastrocytomas]], contain cells from different types of glia.

===By grade===
Gliomas are further categorized according to their [[Grading (tumors)|grade]], which is determined by [[pathology|pathologic]] evaluation of the tumor.

[[Image:MRI glioma 28 yr old male.JPG|thumb|right|Low-grade brain glioma in a 28-year-old male. (Taken on 10 July 2007)]]
* '''Low-grade''' gliomas [WHO grade II] are well-differentiated (not [[Anaplasia|anaplastic]]);  these are [[cancer|benign]] and portend a better prognosis for the patient.
* '''High-grade''' [WHO grade III–IV] gliomas are undifferentiated or [[anaplastic]];  these are [[cancer|malignant]] and carry a worse prognosis.

Of numerous grading systems in use, the most common is the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) grading system for astrocytoma, under which tumors are graded from I (least advanced disease—best prognosis) to IV (most advanced disease—worst prognosis).

===By location===
Gliomas can be classified according to whether they are above or below a membrane in the brain called the [[tentorium cerebelli|tentorium]]. The tentorium separates the [[cerebrum]] (above) from the [[cerebellum]] (below).

* [[supratentorial]]: above the tentorium, in the cerebrum, mostly found in adults (70%).
* [[infratentorial]]: below the tentorium, in the cerebellum, mostly found in children (70%).
* pontine: located in the [[pons]] of the brainstem. The brainstem has three parts (pons, midbrain and medulla); the pons controls critical functions such as breathing, making surgery on these extremely dangerous.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of gliomas depend on which part of the central nervous system is affected.  A [[brain tumor|brain glioma]] can cause [[headaches]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[seizures]], and [[cranial nerve]] disorders as a result of increased intracranial pressure. A glioma of the [[optic nerve]] can cause visual loss.  Spinal cord gliomas can cause [[pain]], [[weakness]], or [[numbness]] in the extremities.  Gliomas do not [[metastasis|metastasize]] by the bloodstream, but they can spread via the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and cause "drop metastases" to the spinal cord.

A child who has a subacute disorder of the central nervous system that produces cranial nerve abnormalities (especially of cranial nerve VII and the lower bulbar nerves), long-tract signs, unsteady gait secondary to spasticity, and some behavioral changes is most
likely to have a pontine glioma.<ref>PRETEST pediatrics pg 224</ref>

==Causes==
The exact causes of gliomas are not known.  Hereditary [[genetic disorders]] such as [[neurofibromatoses]] (type 1 and type 2) and [[tuberous sclerosis complex]] are known to predispose to their development.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reuss|first=D|coauthors=von Deimling, A|title=Hereditary tumor syndromes and gliomas.|journal=Recent results in cancer research.

Gliomas have been correlated to the [[electromagnetic radiation]] from [[cell phones]], and a link between the cancer and cell phone usage is considered plausible, though there is no conclusive evidence.<ref>http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf</ref> Most glioblastomas are infected with [[cytomegalovirus]], however the significance of this is not known.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Michaelis|first=M|coauthors=Baumgarten, P, Mittelbronn, M, Driever, PH, Doerr, HW, Cinatl J, Jr|title=Oncomodulation by human cytomegalovirus: novel clinical findings open new roads.|journal=Medical microbiology and immunology|date=2011 Feb|volume=200|issue=1|pages=1–5|pmid=20967552|doi=10.1007/s00430-010-0177-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Barami|first=K|title=Oncomodulatory mechanisms of human cytomegalovirus in gliomas.|journal=Journal of Clinical Neuroscience |date=2010 Jul|volume=17|issue=7|pages=819–23|pmid=20427188|doi=10.1016/j.jocn.2009.10.040}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
High-grade gliomas are highly-[[vascular tumor (disambiguation)|vascular tumors]] and have a tendency to infiltrate.  They have extensive areas of [[necrosis]] and [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].  Often tumor growth causes a breakdown of the [[blood–brain barrier]] in the vicinity of the tumor.  As a rule, high-grade gliomas almost always grow back even after complete surgical excision, and so are commonly called recurrent cancer of the brain.

On the other hand, low-grade gliomas grow slowly, often over many years, and can be followed without treatment unless they grow and cause symptoms.

Several acquired (not inherited) genetic mutations have been found in gliomas. [[P53|Tumor suppressor protein 53]] (p53) is an early mutation. p53 is the "guardian of the genome," which, during DNA and cell duplication, makes sure that the DNA is copied correctly and destroys the cell ([[apoptosis]]) if the DNA is mutated and can't be fixed. When p53 itself is mutated, other mutations can survive. [[Phosphatase and tensin homolog]] (PTEN), another protein that also helps destroy cells with dangerous mutations, is itself lost or mutated. [[Epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR), a growth factor that normally stimulates cells to divide, is amplified and stimulates cells to divide too much. Together, these mutations lead to cells dividing uncontrollably, a hallmark of cancer. Recently, mutations in IDH1 and [[IDH2]] were found to be part of the mechanism and associated with a more favorable prognosis.<ref>{{Cite journal

Mitochondria are involved in [[apoptosis]]. Furthermore, the altered [[glycolysis]] metabolism in some cancer cells leads to low oxygen ([[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]). The normal response to hypoxia is to stimulate the growth of new blood vessels ([[angiogenesis]]). So these two genes may contribute to both the lack of apoptosis and vascularization of gliomas.

==Prognosis==

Gliomas are rarely curable.  The prognosis for patients with high-grade gliomas is generally poor, and is especially so for older patients.  Of 10,000 Americans diagnosed each year with malignant gliomas, about half are alive one year after diagnosis, and 25% after two years. Those with anaplastic astrocytoma survive about three years. Glioblastoma multiforme has a worse prognosis with less than a 12-month average survival after diagnosis, though this has extended to 14 months with more recent treatments .<ref>{{cite news |author=Rob Stein |title=Malignant Gliomas Affect About 10,000 Americans Annually |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/20/AR2008052001376.html |publisher=Washington Post |date=May 20, 2008 }}</ref>

===Low Grade Glioma===
For low-grade tumors, the prognosis is somewhat more optimistic. Patients diagnosed with a low-grade glioma are 17 times as likely to die as matched patients in the general population.<ref name="lgg">{{cite web | title=Relative Survival of Patients with Supratentorial Low Grade Gliomas | publisher=Neuro-Oncology | date=July 6, 2012 | accessdate=July 7, 2012 | author=Smoll N, Gautschi OP, Schatlo B, Schaller K, Weber DC}}</ref> The age-standardized 10-year relative survival rate was 47%.<ref name="lgg">{{cite web | title=Relative Survival of Patients with Supratentorial Low Grade Gliomas | publisher=Neuro-Oncology | date=July 6, 2012 | accessdate=July 7, 2012 | author=Smoll, Nicolas}}</ref> One study reported that low-grade [[oligodendroglioma]] patients have a median survival of 11.6 years;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ohgaki H, Kleihues P |title=Population-based studies on incidence, survival rates, and genetic alterations in astrocytic and oligodendroglial gliomas |journal=J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. |volume=64 |issue=6 |pages=479–89 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15977639 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0022-3069&volume=64&issue=6&spage=479}}</ref> another reported a median survival of 16.7 years.<ref>http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/54/7/1442</ref>

===High Grade Glioma===
This group comprises anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastoma multiforme.

==Treatment==
Treatment for [[brain tumor|brain gliomas]] depends on the location, the cell type and the grade of malignancy. Often, treatment is a combined approach, using surgery, [[radiation therapy]], and [[chemotherapy]].  The radiation therapy is in the form of external beam radiation or the [[stereotactic surgery|stereotactic]] approach using [[radiosurgery]]. Spinal cord tumors can be treated by surgery and radiation. [[Temozolomide]] is a chemotherapeutic drug that is able to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] effectively and is currently being used in therapy for high-grade tumors.

===Refractory disease===
For recurrent high-grade glioblastoma, recent studies have taken advantage of [[angiogenic]] blockers such as [[bevacizumab]] in combination with conventional chemotherapy, with encouraging results.<ref name="pmid17947716">{{cite journal |author=Wong ET, Brem S |title=Taming glioblastoma: targeting angiogenesis |journal=J.

== Oncophage, or vitespen ==
The European [[orphan status]] vaccine and Russian approved vaccine/drug Oncophage, now renamed "vitespen", are currently used at the Brain Tumor Research Center at the University of California, San Francisco, which has begun enrolling patients into a Phase 2 clinical trials in combination with the standard of care—radiation therapy plus [[temozolomide]]—for newly diagnosed glioma patients. The overall goals of the investigator-sponsored study are to evaluate median overall survival, progression-free survival and immunologic response to vaccine treatment.<ref>Www.antigenics.com</ref><ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00293423|GP96 Heat Shock Protein-Peptide Complex Vaccine in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioma}}</ref> The FDA has now set a provision allowing patients to receive such care using experimental drugs such as Oncophage to those in need with no other resource for care in the United States.

"To date, improvements in overall survival for newly diagnosed glioma patients have been negligible", said the principal investigator, Andrew T. Parsa. "The rationale for moving Oncophage into this patient population and combining it with radiation and Temodar was underscored by the encouraging results from the ongoing Phase 2 study in recurrent glioma, a more challenging patient population where the results showed overall survival increasing to approximately 10.5 months" from a median of 6.5 months after surgery.

The [[autologous]] tumour derived [[heat shock protein]]–[[peptide]] complex 96 ([[HSPPC-96]]) vaccine called "vitespen" has shown a promising safety profile in trials to date. In [[phase III clinical trials]] against melanoma and kidney cancer, it was shown to have very low toxicity.<ref>{{cite journal
