'''Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies''' ('''ANCAs''') are a group of [[autoantibodies]], mainly of the [[IgG]] type, against [[antigen]]s in the [[cytoplasm]] of [[neutrophil granulocyte]]s (the most common type of [[white blood cell]]) and [[monocytes]]. They are detected as a [[blood test]] in a number of [[autoimmune disorder]]s, but are particularly associated with systemic [[vasculitis]], so called [[ANCA-associated vasculitides]].

==ANCA IF patterns==
{{see also|C-ANCA|P-ANCA}}
[[Immunofluorescence]] (IF) on ethanol-fixed neutrophils is used to detect ANCA, although formalin-fixed neutrophils may be used to help differentiate ANCA patterns. ANCA can be divided into four patterns when visualised by IF; cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA), C-ANCA (atypical), perinuclear ANCA (p-ANCA) and atypical ANCA (a-ANCA), also known as x-ANCA. c-ANCA shows cytoplasmic granular fluorescence with central interlobular accentuation. c-ANCA (atypical) shows cytoplasmic staining that is usually uniform and has no interlobular accentuation. p-ANCA has three subtypes, classical p-ANCA, p-ANCA without nuclear extension and granulocyte specific-antinuclear antibody (GS-ANA). Classical p-ANCA shows perinuclear staining with nuclear extension, p-ANCA without nuclear extension has perinuclear staining without nuclear extension and GS-ANA shows nuclear staining on granulocytes only. a-ANCA often shows combinations of both cytoplasmic and perinuclear staining.<ref name="isbn0704485109">{{cite book|last=Mead|first=A.R. Bradwell, R.P. Stokes, G.P.|title=Advanced atlas of autoantibody patterns|year=1999|publisher=The Binding Site|location=Birmingham|isbn=0704485109}}</ref>

==ANCA antigens==
The c-ANCA antigen is specifically [[proteinase 3]] (PR3). c-ANCA (atypical) antigens include [[myeloperoxidase]] (MPO) and bacterial permiability increasing factor (BPI). Other antigens exist for c-ANCA (atypical), however many are as yet unknown. Classical p-ANCA occurs with antibodies directed to MPO. p-ANCA without nuclear extension occurs with antibodies to BPI, [[cathepsin G]], [[elastase]], [[lactoferrin]] and [[lysozyme]]. GS-ANA are antibodies directed to granulocyte specific nuclear antigens. Atypical ANCA are thought to be antigens similar to that of the p-ANCAs, however may occur due to differences in neutrophil processing.<ref name="isbn0704485109"/>

Other less common antigens include [[HMGB1|HMG1]] (p-ANCA pattern), [[HMGB2|HMG2]] (p-ANCA pattern), [[alpha enolase]] (p and c-ANCA pattern), [[catalase]] (p and c-ANCA pattern), [[beta-glucuronidase|beta glucuronidase]] (p-ANCA pattern), [[azurocidin 1|azurocidin]] (p and c-ANCA pattern), [[actin]] (p and a-ANCA) and [[LAMP2|h-lamp-2]] (c-ANCA).<ref name="isbn0704485109"/>

==ELISA==
[[Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA) is used in diagnostic laboratories to detect ANCAs. Although IF can be used to screen for many ANCAs, ELISA is used to detect antibodies to individual antigens. The most common antigens used on an ELISA [[microtitre plate]] are MPO and PR3, which are usually tested for after a positive IF test.<ref name = "PMID10820938">{{cite journal|last=Savige|first=J|coauthors=Davies, D; Falk, RJ; Jennette, JC; Wiik, A|title=Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and associated diseases: a review of the clinical and laboratory features.|journal=Kidney international|date=2000 Mar|volume=57|issue=3|pages=846–62|pmid=10720938}}</ref>

==Development==
It is poorly understood how ANCA are developed, although several hypotheses have been suggested. There is probably a genetic contribution, particularly in genes controlling the level of immune response – although genetic susceptibility is likely to be linked to an environmental factor, some possible factors including vaccination or exposure to silicates. Two possible mechanisms of ANCA development are postulated, although neither of these theories answers the question of how the different ANCA specificities are developed, and there is much research still being undertaken on the development of ANCA.<ref name=Reumaux>Reumaux D, Duthilleul P, Roos D. Pathogenesis of diseases associated with antineutrophil cytoplasm autoantibodies. ''Hum Immunol'' 2004;'''65'''(1):1-12. PMID 14700590.</ref>

===Theory of molecular mimicry===
Microbial [[superantigen]]s are molecules expressed by bacteria and other microorganisms that have the power to stimulate a strong immune response by activation of [[T-cells]]. These molecules generally have regions that resemble self-antigens that promote a residual autoimmune response – this is the theory of molecular mimicry. Staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens have been characterised in autoimmune diseases – the classical example in post group A streptococcal [[rheumatic heart disease]], where there is similarity between M proteins of ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' to cardiac [[myosin]] and [[laminin]]. It has also been shown that up to 70% of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (previously known as [[Wegener's granulomatosis]]) are chronic nasal carriers of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', with carriers having an eight times increased risk of relapse.<ref name=Reumaux/>  This would therefore be considered a [[type II hypersensitivity]] reaction.

===Theory of defective apoptosis===
Neutrophil [[apoptosis]], or programmed cell death, is vital in controlling the duration of the early inflammatory response, thus restricting damage to tissues by the neutrophils. ANCA may be developed either via ineffective apoptosis or ineffective removal of apoptotic cell fragments, leading to the exposure of the immune system to molecules normally sequestered inside the cells. This theory solves the paradox of how it could be possible for antibodies to be raised against the intracellular antigenic targets of ANCA.<ref name=Reumaux/>

==Role in disease==

===Disease associations===
ANCAs are associated with small vessel vasculitides including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (previously known as [[Wegener's granulomatosis]]), [[microscopic polyangiitis]], primary pauciimmune necrotizing cresentric glomerulonephritis (a type of renal-limited microscopic polyangiitis), [[Churg-Strauss syndrome]] and drug induced vasculitides. PR3 directed c-ANCA is present in 80-90% of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, 20-40% of microscopic polyangiitis, 20-40% of pauciimmune cresentric glomerulonephritis and 35% of Churg-Strauss syndrome. c-ANCA (atypical) is present in 80% of cystic fibrosis (with BPI as the target antigen) and also in [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] and [[rheumatoid arthritis]] (with antibodies to multiple antigenic targets). p-ANCA with MPO specificity is found in 50% of microscopic polyangiitis, 50% of primary pauciimmune necrotizing cresentric glomerulonephritis and 35% of Churg-Strauss syndrome. p-ANCA with specificity to other antigens are associated with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, drug-induced vasculitis, [[autoimmune hepatitis|autoimmune liver disease]], drug induced syndromes and parasitic infections. Atypical ANCA is associated with drug-induced systemic vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis.<ref name = "PMID10820938"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Bossuyt|first=X|title=Serologic markers in inflammatory bowel disease.|journal=Clinical chemistry|date=2006 Feb|volume=52|issue=2|pages=171–81|pmid=16339302}}</ref>

The presence or absence of ANCA can not indicate presence or absence of disease and results are correlated with clinical features. The association of ANCA and disease activity remains controversial; however, the reappearance of ANCA after treatment can indicate a relapse.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sinclair|first=D|coauthors=Stevens, JM|title=Role of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and glomerular basement membrane antibodies in the diagnosis and monitoring of systemic vasculitides.|journal=Annals of clinical biochemistry|date=2007 Sep|volume=44|issue=Pt 5|pages=432–42|pmid=17761028}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Stegeman|first=CA|title=Predictive value of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies

===Pathogenesis===
Although the pathogenic role of ANCA is still controversial, ''in vitro'' and animal models support the idea that the antibodies have a direct pathological role in the formation of small vessel vasculitides. MPO and PR3 specific ANCA can activate neutrophils and monocytes through their [[Fc receptor|Fc]] and Fab'2 receptors, which can be enhanced by cytokines which cause neutrophils to display MPO and PR3 on their surface. Activated neutrophils adhere to endothelial cells where degranulation occurs. This releases free oxygen radicals and lytic enzymes, resulting in damage to the endothelium via the induction of [[necrosis]] and [[apoptosis]]. Furthermore, neutrophils release chemoattractive signalling molecules that recruit more neutrophils to the endothelium, acting as a positive feedback loop. Animal models have shown that MPO antibodies can induce necrotizing cresentric glomerulonephritis and systemic small vessel vasculitis. In these animal models the formation of glomerulonephritis and vasculitis can occur in the absence of T cells, however neutrophils must be present.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Falk|first=RJ|coauthors=Jennette, JC|title=ANCA disease: where is this field heading?|journal=Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN|date=2010 May|volume=21|issue=5|pages=745–52|pmid=20395376}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Seo|first=P|coauthors=Stone, JH|title=The antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides.|journal=The American journal of medicine|date=2004 Jul 1|volume=117|issue=1|pages=39–50|pmid=15210387}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Jennette|first=JC|coauthors=Xiao, H; Falk, RJ|title=Pathogenesis of vascular inflammation by anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies.|journal=Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN|date=2006 May|volume=17|issue=5|pages=1235–42|pmid=16624929}}</ref><ref>[[Ronald J.
