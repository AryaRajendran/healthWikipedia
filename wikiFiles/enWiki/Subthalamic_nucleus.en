The '''subthalamic nucleus''' is a small lens-shaped [[Nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nucleus]] in the [[brain]] where it is, from a functional point of view, part of the [[basal ganglia]] system. In terms of anatomy, it is the major part of [[subthalamus]]. As suggested by its name, the subthalamic nucleus is located [[Anatomical terms of location|ventral]] to the [[thalamus]]. It is also dorsal to the [[substantia nigra]] and medial to the [[internal capsule]]. It was first described by [[Jules Bernard Luys]] in 1865,<ref>{{cite book | last=Luys | first=Jules Bernard | authorlink=Jules Bernard Luys | year=1865 | title=Recherches sur le système cérébro-spinal, sa structure, ses fonctions et ses maladies | publisher=Baillière | location=Paris | language=French}}</ref> and the term ''corpus Luysi'' or ''Luys' body'' is still sometimes used.

==Anatomy==

===Structure===
The principal type of [[neuron]] found in the subthalamic nucleus has rather long sparsely spiny [[dendrite]]s.<ref name=Afsharpour1985>{{Cite doi|10.1002/cne.902360102}}</ref><ref>{{Cite doi|10.1002/cne.901680105}}</ref> The dendritic arborizations are ellipsoid, replicating in smaller dimension the shape of the nucleus.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Yelnik, J. & Percheron, G. | title=Subthalamic neurons in primates : a quantitative and comparative anatomy | journal=Neuroscience | year=1979 | pages=1717–1743 | volume=4 | issue=11 | pmid=117397 | doi=10.1016/0306-4522(79)90030-7}}</ref> The dimensions of these arborizations (1200,600 and 300 μm) are similar across many species—including rat, cat, monkey and man—which is unusual. However, the number of neurons increases with brain size as well as the external dimensions of the nucleus. The principal neurons are [[glutamatergic]], which give them a particular functional position in the basal ganglia system. In humans there are also a small number (about 7.5%) of [[GABA]]ergic [[interneuron]]s that participate in the local circuitry; however, the dendritic arborizations of subthalamic neurons shy away from the border and majorly interact with one another.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Levesque J.C. & Parent A. | title=GABAergic interneurons in human subthalamic nucleus | journal=Movement Disorders | year=2005 | pages=574–584 | volume=20 | issue=5 | pmid=15645534 | doi=10.1002/mds.20374}}</ref>

===Afferent axons===
The subthalamic nucleus receives its main input from the [[GPe|globus pallidus]],<ref name="pmid2350684">{{cite journal |author=Canteras NS, Shammah-Lagnado SJ, Silva BA, Ricardo JA |title=Afferent connections of the subthalamic nucleus: a combined retrograde and anterograde horseradish peroxidase study in the rat |journal=Brain Res. |volume=513 |issue=1 |pages=43–59 |year=1990 |month=April |pmid=2350684 |doi= 10.1016/0006-8993(90)91087-W|url=}}</ref> not so much through the [[ansa lenticularis]] as often said but by radiating fibers crossing the medial pallidum first and the internal capsule (see figure). These afferents are GABAergic, inhibiting neurons in the subthalamic nucleus. Excitatory, glutamatergic inputs come from the [[cerebral cortex]] (particularly the motor cortex), and from the pars [[parafascicularis]] of the [[central complex]]. The subthalamic nucleus also receives [[neuromodulator]]y inputs, notably [[dopaminergic]] axons from the [[substantia nigra]] pars compacta.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Cragg S.J.; Baufreton J.; Xue Y.; Bolam J.P.; & Bevan M.D. | title=Synaptic release of dopamine in the subthalamic nucleus | journal=European Journal of Neuroscience | year=2004 | pages=1788–1802 | volume=20 | issue=7 | pmid=15380000 | doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2004.03629.x}}</ref>
It also receives inputs from the [[pedunculopontine nucleus]].

===Efferent targets===
The axons of subthalamic nucleus neurons leave the nucleus dorsally. The efferent axons are glutamatergic (excitatory). Except for the connection to the striatum (17.3% in macaques), most of the subthalamic principal neurons are multitargets and directed to the other elements of the core of the basal ganglia.<ref name="pmid418083">{{cite journal |author=Nauta HJ, Cole M |title=Efferent projections of the subthalamic nucleus: an autoradiographic study in monkey and cat |journal=J. Comp. Neurol. |volume=180 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |year=1978 |month=July |pmid=418083 |doi=10.1002/cne.901800102 |url=}}</ref> Some send axons to the substantia nigra medially and to the medial and lateral nuclei of the pallidum laterally (3-target, 21.3%). Some are 2-target with the lateral pallidum and the substantia nigra (2.7%) or the lateral pallidum and the medial (48%). Less are single target for the lateral pallidum. In the pallidum, subthalamic terminals end in bands parallel to the pallidal border.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Nauta, H.J.W. & Cole, M. | title=Efferent projections of the subthalamic nucleus : an autoradiographic study in monkey and cat | journal=Journal of Comparative Neurology | year=1978 | pages=1–16 | volume=180 | issue=1 | pmid=418083 | doi=10.1002/cne.901800102}}</ref><ref name=Smith1990>{{cite journal | author=Smith, Y.; Hazrati, L-N. & Parent, A. | title=Efferent projections of the subthalamic nucleus in the squirrel monkey as studied by the PHA-L anterograde tracing method | journal=Journal of Comparative Neurology | year=1990 | pages=306–323 | volume=294 | issue=2 | pmid=2332533 | doi=10.1002/cne.902940213}}</ref> When all axons reaching this target are added, the main afference of the subthalamic nucleus is, in 82.7% of the cases, clearly the [[medial pallidum]] (internal segment of the globus pallidus).

Some researchers have reported internal [[axon]] collaterals.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Kita, H.; Chang, H.T.; & Kitai, S.T. | title=The morphology of intracellularly labeled rat subthalamic neurons: A light microscopic analysis | journal=Neuroscience | year=1983 | pages=245–257 | volume=215 | issue=3 | pmid=6304154 | doi=10.1002/cne.902150302}}</ref> However, there is little functional evidence for this.

===Subthalamic nucleus===
The first intracellular electrical recordings of subthalamic neurons were performed using sharp electrodes in a rat slice preparation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  In these recordings three key observations were made, all three of which have dominated subsequent reports of subthalamic firing properties.  The first observation was that, in the absence of current injection or synaptic stimulation, the majority of cells were spontaneously firing.  The second observation is that these cells are capable of transiently firing at very high frequencies.    The third observation concerns non-linear behaviors when cells are transiently depolarized after being hyperpolarized below –65mV.  They are then able to engage voltage-gated calcium and sodium currents to fire bursts of action potentials.

Several recent studies have focused on the autonomous pacemaking ability of subthalamic neurons.  These cells are often referred to as "fast-spiking pacemakers",<ref>{{cite journal | author=Surmeier D.J.; Mercer J.N.; & Chan C.S. | title=Autonomous pacemakers in the basal ganglia: who needs excitatory synapses anyway? | journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology | year=2005 | pages=312–318 | volume=15 | issue=3 | pmid=15916893 | doi=10.1016/j.conb.2005.05.007}}</ref> since they can generate spontaneous [[action potential]]s at rates of 80 to 90&nbsp;Hz in primates.

=== Lateropallido-subthalamic system===
Strong reciprocal connections link the subthalamic nucleus and the external segment of the [[globus pallidus]]. Both are fast-spiking pacemakers. Together, they are thought to constitute the "central pacemaker of the basal ganglia"<ref>{{cite journal | author=Plenz, D. & Kitai, S.T. | title=A basal ganglia pacemaker formed by the subthalamic nucleus and external globus pallidus | journal=Nature | year=1999 | pages=677–682 | volume=400 | issue=6745 | pmid=10458164 | doi=10.1038/23281}}</ref> with synchronous bursts.

The connection of the lateral pallidum with the subthalamic nucleus is also the one in the [[basal ganglia]] system where the reduction between emitter/receiving elements is likely the strongest. In terms of volume, in humans, the lateral pallidum measures 808&nbsp;mm³, the subthalamic nucleus only 158&nbsp;mm³.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Yelnik, J. | title=Functional anatomy of the basal ganglia | journal=Movement Disorders | year=2002 | pages=S15–S21 | volume=17 | issue=Suppl. 3 | pmid=11948751 | doi=10.1002/mds.10138}}</ref> This translated in numbers of neurons represents a strong compression with loss of map precision.

Some axons from the lateral pallidum go to the striatum.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Sato, F.; Lavallée, P.; Levesque, M. & Parent, A. | title=Single-axon tracing study of neurons of the external segment of the globus pallidus in primate | journal=Journal of Comparative Neurology | year=2000 | pages=17–31 | volume=417 | issue=1 | pmid=10660885 | doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-9861(20000131)417:1<17::AID-CNE2>3.0.CO;2-I}}</ref> The activity of the medial pallidum is influenced by afferences from the lateral pallidum and from the subthalamic nucleus.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Smith, Y.; Wichmann, T. & DeLong, M.R. | title=Synaptic innervation of neurones in the internal pallidal segment by the subthalamic nucleus and the external pallidum in monkeys | journal=Journal of Comparative Neurology | year=1994 | pages=297–318 | volume=343 | issue=2 | pmid=8027445 | doi=10.1002/cne.903430209}}</ref> The same for the [[nigra reticulata]].<ref name=Smith1990 /> The subthalamic nucleus  sends axons to another regulator: the pedunculo-pontine complex (id).

The lateropallido-subthalamic system is thought to play a key role in the generation of the patterns of activity seen in [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Bevan M.D.; Magill P.J.; Terman D.; Bolam J.P.; & Wilson CJ. | title=Move to the rhythm: oscillations in the subthalamic nucleus-external globus pallidus network | journal=Trends in Neurosciences | year=2002 | pages=525–531 | volume=25 | issue=10 | pmid=12220881 | doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(02)02235-X}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Chronic stimulation of the STN, called [[deep brain stimulation]] (DBS), is used to treat patients with [[Parkinson disease]]. The first to be stimulated are the terminal arborisations of afferent axons, which modify the activity of subthalamic neurons. However, it has been shown in thalamic slices from mice,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Bekar L., Libionka W., Tian G., Xu Q., Torres A., Wang X., Lovatt D., Williams E., Takano T., Schnermann J., Bakos R., Nedergaard M. | title=Adenosine is crucial for deep brain stimulation–mediated attenuation of tremor| journal=Nature Medicine | year=2008 | pages=75–80 | volume=14 | issue=1 | doi=10.1038/nm1693 | pmid=18157140 }}</ref> that the stimulus also causes nearby astrocytes to release [[Adenosine Triphosphate]] (ATP), a precursor to [[adenosine]] (through a catabolic process). In turn, adenosine A1 receptor activation depresses excitatory transmission in the thalamus, thus mimicking [[ablation]] of the subthalamic nucleus.

Unilateral destruction or disruption of the subthalamic nucleus – which can commonly occur via a small vessel stroke in patients with diabetes, hypertension, or a history of smoking – produces [[hemiballismus]].

As one of the STN's suspected functions is in impulse control, dysfunction in this region has been implicated in [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Rita|title=The Human Brain Book|pages=58,233}}</ref> Artificially stimulating the STN has shown some promise in correcting severe implusive behavior and may later be used as an alternative treatment for the disorder.<ref>{{cite journal|last=L|first=Mallet|coauthors=Polosan M, Jaafari N, Baup N, Welter ML, Fontaine D, etc.|title=Subthalamic nucleus stimulation in severe obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|year=2008}}</ref>

==Function==
The function of the STN is unknown, but current theories place it as a component of the [[basal ganglia]] control system that may perform action selection. STN dysfunction has also been shown to increase impulsivity in individuals presented with two equally rewarding stimuli.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Frank, M.; Samanta, J.; Moustafa, A.; Sherman, S. | title=Hold Your Horses: Impulsivity, Deep Brain Stimulation, and Medication in Parkinsonism | journal=Science | year=2007 | pages=1309–12 | volume=318 | issue=5854 | pmid=17962524 | doi=10.1126/science.1146157}}</ref>
