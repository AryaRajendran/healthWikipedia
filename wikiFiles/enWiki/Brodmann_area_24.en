'''Brodmann area 24''' is part of the [[anterior cingulate]] in the [[human brain]]. 

==Human==
In the human this area is known as '''ventral anterior cingulate area 24''', and it refers to a subdivision of the [[cytoarchitecture|cytoarchitecturally]] defined [[cingulate cortex]] region of [[cerebral cortex]] (area [[cingularis anterior ventralis]]). It occupies most of the [[anterior cingulate gyrus]] in an arc around the [[genu]] of [[corpus callosum]]. Its outer border corresponds approximately to the [[cingulate sulcus]]. Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded internally by the [[pregenual area 33]], externally by the [[dorsal anterior cingulate area 32]], and caudally by the [[ventral posterior cingulate area 23]] and the [[dorsal posterior cingulate area 31]].

[[Francis Crick]], one of the discoverers of [[DNA]], listed area 24 as the seat of free will because of its centrality in [[abulia]] and amotivational syndromes {{Fact|date=December 2007}}.

==Guenon==
In the [[guenon]] this area is referred to as '''area 24 of Brodmann-1905'''. It includes portions of the [[cingulate gyrus]] and the [[frontal lobe]]. The [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] is thin; it lacks the internal [[granular layer]] (IV) so that the densely distributed, plump [[pyramidal cell]]s of sublayer 3b of the external [[pyramidal layer]] (III) merge with similar cells of the internal pyramidal layer (V); the multiform layer (VI) is very thin (Brodmann-1905). Note that Brodmann later divided this area into two areas, area 24 of Brodmann-1909 and [[Brodmann area 25|area 25 of Brodmann]]-1909 (Brodmann-1909).

== Subdivisions ==
The area has been subdivided further, and Vogt et al.<ref>[[Brent A. Vogt]], Deepak N. Pandya, Douglas L. Rosene, "[http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/cne.902620207 Cingulate cortex of the rhesus monkey: I. Cytoarchitecture and thalamic afferents]," ''[[The Journal of Comparative Neurology]]'', '''262'''(2):256-270, 1987.</ref> make three division for the area in the [[rhesus monkey]] (''Macaca mulatta''):
* 24a: "adjacent to the callosal sulcus"
* 24b: "has more clearly defined layers II, III, and Va"
* 24c: "the lower bank of the anterior cingulate sulcus"
