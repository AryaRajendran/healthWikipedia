'''Medical tourism''' (MT) is patient movement from highly developed nations to other areas of the world for medical care, usually to find treatment at a lower cost.  Medical tourism is different from the traditional model of international medical travel where patients generally journey from less developed nations to major medical centers in highly developed countries for medical treatment that is unavailable in their own communities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medical Tourism: Globalization of the Healthcare Marketplace|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2234298/|publisher=MedGenMed|accessdate=16 September 2012|author=Michael D.

Services typically sought by travelers include elective procedures as well as complex specialized [[surgery|surgeries]] such as [[joint replacement]] ([[Knee replacement|knee]]/[[Hip replacement|hip]]), [[cardiac surgery]], [[dental surgery]], and [[Cosmetic surgery|cosmetic surgeries]]. Individuals with rare [[genetic disorder]]s may travel to another country where treatment of these conditions is better understood. However, virtually every type of health care, including psychiatry, alternative treatments, convalescent care and even burial services are available.

Over 50 countries have identified medical tourism as a national industry.<ref name="Gahlinger2008">Gahlinger, PM. The Medical Tourism Travel Guide: Your Complete Reference to Top-Quality, Low-Cost Dental, Cosmetic, Medical Care & Surgery Overseas. Sunrise River Press, 2008</ref>

==History==
The first recorded instance of medical tourism dates back thousands of years to when [[Greeks|Greek]] pilgrims traveled from all over the [[Mediterranean]] to the small territory in the [[Saronic Gulf]] called [[Epidauria]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} This territory was the sanctuary of the healing god [[Asklepios]]. Epidauria became the original travel destination for medical tourism.

[[Spa town]]s and [[sanatorium|sanitarium]]s may be considered an early form of medical tourism. In eighteenth century England, for example, patients visited [[spa town|spa]]s because they were places with supposedly health-giving [[mineral water]]s, treating diseases from [[gout]] to [[liver]] disorders and [[bronchitis]].<ref name="Gahlinger2008"/>

==Description==
Factors that have led to the increasing popularity of medical travel include the high cost of health care, long wait times for certain procedures, the ease and affordability of international travel, and improvements in both technology and standards of care in many countries.<ref name="Goering March 28, 2008">Laurie Goering, [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-medical-tourism_goeringmar28,0,4555735.story  "For big surgery, Delhi is dealing,"] The [[Chicago Tribune]], March 28, 2008</ref>  The avoidance of waiting times is the leading factor for medical tourism from the UK, whereas in the US, the main reason is cheaper prices abroad. In 2009, there were 60,000 patients going for treatment abroad in the UK.<ref name="Medical Tourism highlights">[http://www.medbeaver.co.uk/advice-articles/infographic#infomercial Medical tourism highlights] MedBeaver.co.uk, April 2012</ref>

Many surgery procedures performed in medical tourism destinations cost a fraction of the price they do in the [[First World]].  For example a liver transplant that costs $300,000 USD in America costs about $91,000 USD in Taiwan.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2004023,00.html | work=Time | first=Sarah | last=Tung | title=Is Taiwan Asia's Next One-Stop Plastic-Surgery Shop? | date=July 16, 2010}}</ref> A large draw to medical travel is convenience and speed. Countries that operate public health-care systems are often so taxed that it can take considerable time to get non-urgent medical care.  Using Canada as an example, an estimated 782,936 Canadians spent time on medical waiting lists in 2005, waiting an average of 9.4 weeks.<ref>[http://www.fraserinstitute.org/Commerce.Web/product_files/PrivateCostofPublicQueues2005.pdf The Private Cost of Public Queues in 2005], [[Fraser Institute]]</ref> Canada has set waiting-time benchmarks, e.&nbsp;g. 26 weeks for a hip replacement and 16 weeks for cataract surgery, for non-urgent medical procedures.<ref>[http://www.canada.com/Wait+times+shorter+some+medical+procedures+report/1528971/story.html Wait times shorter for some medical procedures: report.], [[Canwest News Service]]</ref>

Medical tourists come from a variety of locations including Europe, the Middle East, Japan, the United States, and Canada. Factors that drive demand for medical services abroad in First World countries include: large populations, comparatively high wealth, the high expense of health care or lack of health care options locally, and increasingly high expectations of their populations with respect to health care.

In First World countries like the United States medical tourism has large growth prospects and potentially destabilizing implications.  A forecast by [[Deloitte Consulting]] published in August 2008 projected that medical tourism originating in the US could jump by a factor of ten over the next decade.  An estimated 750,000 Americans went abroad for health care in 2007, and the report estimated that 1.5 million would seek health care outside the US in 2008.  The growth in medical tourism has the potential to cost US health care providers billions of dollars in lost revenue.<ref>Linda A. Johnson, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/03/BUGA121GPF.DTL&type=health "Americans look abroad to save on health care: Medical tourism could jump tenfold in next decade,"] The [[San Francisco Chronicle]], August 3, 2008</ref>

An authority at the Harvard Business School recently stated that "medical tourism is promoted much more heavily in the United Kingdom than in the United States".<ref>Lagace, Martha [http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5814.html "The Rise of Medical Tourism"], Harvard Business School Working Knowledge, December 17, 2007. Retrieved July 1, 2008.</ref>

Additionally, some patients in some First World countries are finding that insurance either does not cover orthopedic surgery (such as knee/hip replacement) or limits the choice of the facility, surgeon, or prosthetics to be used. Medical tourism for knee/hip replacements has emerged as one of the more widely accepted procedures because of the lower cost and minimal difficulties associated with the traveling to/from the surgery.

Popular medical travel worldwide destinations include: [[Argentina]], [[Brunei]], [[Cuba]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Hungary]], [[India]], [[Jordan]], [[Lithuania]], [[Malaysia]], [[The Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[South Africa]], [[Thailand]], and recently, [[Saudi Arabia]], [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]], [[South Korea]], [[Tunisia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[New Zealand]].<ref name="Gahlinger2008"/>

Popular '''cosmetic surgery travel''' destinations include: [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Cuba]], [[Mexico]], [[Turkey]], [[Thailand]] and [[Ukraine]]. In South America, countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil and Colombia lead on plastic surgery medical skills relying on their experienced plastic surgeons. In Bolivia and Colombia, plastic surgery has also become quite common. According to the "Sociedad Boliviana de Cirugia Plastica y Reconstructiva", more than 70% of middle and upper class women in the country have had some form of plastic surgery. Colombia also provides advanced care in cardiovascular and transplant surgery.

In Europe [[Belgium]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Ukraine]] are also breaking into the business.
[[South Africa]] is taking the term "medical tourism" very literally by promoting their "medical safaris".<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/healthcare/medicaltourism.html "Medical tourism: Need surgery, will travel"] ''CBC News Online'', June 18, 2004. Retrieved September 5, 2006.</ref>

A specialized subset of medical tourism is '''reproductive tourism''' and '''reproductive outsourcing''',<ref>Jones CA, Keith LG. Medical tourism and reproductive outsourcing: the dawning of a new paradigm for healthcare. [[Int J Fertil Womens Med]], 2006;51:251-255</ref> which is the practice of traveling abroad to undergo [[in-vitro fertilization]], [[surrogate pregnancy]] and other [[assisted reproductive technology]] treatments including freezing embryos for retro-production.<ref>Jones C, "Ethical and legal conundrums of post-modern procreation" [[Int J Gynaecol Obstet]] Dec 4, 2007</ref>

However, perceptions of medical tourism are not always positive. In places like the US, which has high standards of quality, medical tourism is viewed as risky. In some parts of the world, wider political issues can influence where medical tourists will choose to seek out health care.

[[Health tourism provider]]s have developed as intermediaries to unite potential medical tourists with provider hospitals and other organisations. Companies are beginning to offer global health care options that will enable North American and European patients to access world health care at a fraction of the cost of domestic care. Companies that focus on medical value travel typically provide nurse case managers to assist patients with pre- and post-travel medical issues. They also help provide resources for follow-up care upon the patient's return.

== Process ==
The typical process is as follows: the person seeking medical treatment abroad contacts a [[health tourism provider|medical tourism provider]]. The provider usually requires the patient to provide a medical report, including the nature of ailment, local doctor’s opinion, medical history, and diagnosis, and may request additional information. Certified physicians or consultants then advise on the medical treatment. The approximate expenditure, choice of hospitals and tourist destinations, and duration of stay, etc., is discussed. After signing consent bonds and agreements, the patient is given recommendation letters for a medical visa, to be procured from the concerned embassy. The patient travels to the destination country, where the medical tourism provider assigns a case executive, who takes care of the patient's accommodation, treatment and any other form of care. Once the treatment is done, the patient can remain in the tourist destination or return home.

==International healthcare accreditation==
{{Main|International healthcare accreditation}}

International healthcare accreditation is the process of certifying a level of quality for healthcare providers and programs across multiple countries.  [[List of international healthcare accreditation organizations|International healthcare accreditation organizations]] certify a wide range of healthcare programs such as hospitals, primary care centers, medical transport, and ambulatory care services.<ref>{{citation |title=Joint Commission International Accreditation & Certificationweb|url=http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/Accreditation-and-Certification-Process/|publisher=Joint Commission International|accessdate=19 July 2011}}</ref>

The oldest international accrediting body is Accreditation Canada, formerly known as the Canadian Council on Health Services Accreditation,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accreditation.ca/about-us/history/ |title=Accreditation Canada History |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}</ref> which accredited the Bermuda Hospital Board as soon as 1968.  Since then, it has accredited hospitals and health service organizations in ten other countries.

In the United States, the accreditation group [[Joint Commission International]] (JCI) has been inspecting and accrediting health care facilities and hospitals outside of the United States since 1999.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Many international hospitals today see obtaining international accreditation as a way to attract American patients.<ref>[http://www.medicaltravelauthority.com/Medical-Tourism-Magazine-Issue-2.pdf "Medical Tourism Magazine"], Medical Tourism Association, February 2008</ref>

Joint Commission International is a relative of the Joint Commission in the United States. Both are US-style independent private sector not-for-profit organizations that develop nationally and internationally recognized procedures and standards to help improve patient care and safety. They work with hospitals to help them meet Joint Commission standards for patient care and then accredit those hospitals meeting the standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jointcommission.org/AboutUs/Fact_Sheets/jci_facts.htm |title=Facts about Joint Commission International |publisher=Joint Commission |date=2008-12-11 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}</ref>

[[QHA Trent Accreditation]], based in the UK, is an active independent holistic accreditation scheme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qha-international.co.uk |title=QHA Trent |publisher=Qha-international.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1tqmu/ITIJissue128Hospital/resources/22.htm |title=ITIJ issue 128 - Hospitals Review |publisher=Content.yudu.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref>

The different international healthcare accreditation schemes vary in quality, size, cost, intent and the skill and intensity of their marketing. They also vary in terms of cost to hospitals and healthcare institutions making use of them.<ref>[http://www.imtjonline.com/news/india-accreditation-a-must "INDIA: Accreditation a must"], International Medical Travel Journal</ref>  A forecast by Deloitte Consulting regarding medical tourism published in August 2008 noted the value of accreditation in ensuring quality of healthcare and specifically mentioned JCI, ISQUA and Trent.

Increasingly, some hospitals are looking towards dual international accreditation, perhaps having both JCI to cover potential US clientele, QHA Trent for potential British and European clientele, and Accreditation Canada. As a result of competition between clinics for American medical tourists, there have been initiatives to rank hospitals based on patient-reported metrics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldhospitalmonitor.com |title=Home |publisher=World Hospital Monitor |date= |accessdate=2010-09-15}}</ref>

Other organizations providing contributions to quality practices include:
* The [[United Kingdom Accreditation Forum]] (UKAF) is an established network of accreditation organisations with the intention of sharing experience good practice and new ideas around the methodology for accreditation programmes, covering issues such as developing healthcare quality standards, implementation of standards within healthcare organisations, assessment by peer review and exploration of the peer review techniques to include the recruitment, training, monitoring and evaluation of peer reviewers and the mechanisms for awards of accredited status to organisations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukaf.org.uk/TAS.htm |title=United Kingdom Accreditation Forum |publisher=Ukaf.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref>

==Risks==
Medical tourism carries some risks that locally-provided medical care does not.

Some countries, such as India, South Africa, or Thailand have very different infectious disease-related epidemiology to Europe and North America. Exposure to diseases without having built up natural immunity can be a hazard for weakened individuals, specifically with respect to gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. [[Hepatitis A]], [[amoebic dysentery]], [[paratyphoid]]) which could weaken progress and expose the patient to [[Mosquito-borne disease|mosquito-transmitted diseases]], [[influenza]], and [[tuberculosis]]. However, because in poor tropical nations diseases run the gamut, doctors seem to be more open to the possibility of considering any infectious disease, including [[HIV]], TB, and [[typhoid]], while there are cases in the West where patients were consistently misdiagnosed for years because such diseases are perceived to be "rare" in the West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lungil.org/il/copd/TBMisdiagnosed.asp|title=TB Often Misdiagnosed|publisher=American Lung Association of Illinois|accessdate=2007-03-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070301064539/http://www.lungil.org/il/copd/TBMisdiagnosed.asp |archivedate = March 1, 2007}}</ref>

The quality of post-operative care can also vary dramatically, depending on the hospital and country, and may be different from US or European standards. Also, traveling long distances soon after surgery can increase the risk of complications. Long flights and decreased mobility associated with window seats can predispose one towards developing [[deep vein thrombosis]] and potentially a [[pulmonary embolism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chestnet.org/accp/article/new-dvt-guidelines-no-evidence-support-economy-class-syndrome |title=New DVT Guidelines: No Evidence to Support "Economy Class Syndrome"; Oral Contraceptives, Sitting in a Window Seat, Advanced Age, and Pregnancy Increase DVT Risk in Long-distance Travelers |date=7 February 2012 |publisher=American College of Chest Physicians |accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref> Other vacation activities can be problematic as well &mdash; for example, scars may become darker and more noticeable if they sunburn while healing.<ref>[http://familydoctor.org/095.xml "Incision Care"], ''American Academy of Family Physicians'', July, 2005. Retrieved September 18, 2006.</ref> 

Also, health facilities treating medical tourists may lack an adequate complaints policy to deal appropriately and fairly with complaints made by dissatisfied patients.<ref>[http://www.pat.nhs.uk/Docs/ComplaintsPolicyProcedure.pdf ]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref>

Differences in healthcare provider standards around the world have been recognised by the [[World Health Organization]], and in 2004 it launched the [[World Alliance for Patient Safety]]. This body assists hospitals and government around the world in setting patient safety policy and practices that can become particularly relevant when providing medical tourism services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/patientsafety/en/ |title=World Alliance for Patient Safety |publisher=Who.int |date=2010-05-05 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref>

If there are complications, the patient may need to stay in the foreign country for longer than planned or if they have returned home, will not have easy access for follow up care.<ref name="Ginger Rough">{{cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2009/06/07/20090607rxtourism0607.html?nclick_check=1#reply17699291|title=Globe-trotting to cut down on medical costs|last=Ginger Rough|date=June 7, 2009|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref>

===Legal issues===
Receiving medical care abroad may subject medical tourists to unfamiliar legal issues.<ref name="AHC">{{cite web|url=http://www.ahcpub.com/hot_topics/?htid=1&httid=1874 |title=Medical Tourism: Ethical Pitfalls of Seeking Health Care Overseas |publisher=Ahcpub.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> The limited nature of [[litigation]] in various countries is one reason for the lower cost of care overseas. While some countries currently presenting themselves as attractive medical tourism destinations provide some form of legal remedies for [[medical malpractice]], these legal avenues may be unappealing to the medical tourist. Should problems arise, patients might not be covered by adequate personal insurance or might be unable to seek compensation via [[malpractice]] lawsuits. Hospitals and/or doctors in some countries may be unable to pay the financial damages awarded by a court to a patient who has sued them, owing to the hospital and/or the doctor not possessing appropriate insurance cover and/or medical indemnity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalprotection.org/uk |title=Medical Protection Society &#124; MPS UK |publisher=Medicalprotection.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref>

===Ethical issues===
There can be major ethical issues around medical tourism.<ref name="AHC"/> For example, the illegal purchase of organs and tissues for transplantation had been alleged in countries such as India<ref>{{cite web|url=http://future.iftf.org/2006/04/the_dark_side_o.html |title=IFTF's Future Now: The dark side of medical tourism |publisher=Future.iftf.org |date=2006-04-19 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/09/MN23UPQ0K.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Organ-transplant black market thrives in India | first=Anuj | last=Chopra | date=February 9, 2008}}</ref> and China<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.epochtimes.com/news/7-5-23/55627.html |title= Transplants and Ethics in San Francisco |publisher=The Epoch Times |date=2007-05-23 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> prior to 2007. The [[Declaration of Istanbul]] distinguishes between ethically problematic "transplant tourism" and "travel for transplantation".<ref>Participants in the International Summit on Transplant Tourism and Organ Trafficking convened by The Transplantation Society and International Society of Nephrology in Istanbul, Turkey, 30 April to 2 May 2008. "The Declaration of Istanbul on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism." Kidney International 74, no. 7 (2008): 854-59.</ref>

Medical tourism may raise broader ethical issues for the countries in which it is promoted. For example in India, some argue that a "policy of 'medical tourism for the classes and health missions for the masses' will lead to a deepening of the inequities" already embedded in the health care system.<ref>http://www.issuesinmedicalethics.org/132ed042.html</ref> In Thailand, in 2008 it was stated that, "Doctors in Thailand have become so busy with foreigners that Thai patients are having trouble getting care".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16735157 |title=Medical Tourism Creates Thai Doctor Shortage |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> Medical tourism centred on new technologies, such as [[stem cell treatments]], is often criticized on grounds of fraud, blatant lack of scientific rationale and patient safety. However, when pioneering advanced technologies, such as providing 'unproven' therapies to patients outside of regular clinical trials, it is often challenging to differentiate between acceptable medical innovation and unacceptable patient exploitation.<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19556497 |title=Lindvall O, Hyun I.

== Employer-sponsored health care in the US ==
Some US employers have begun exploring medical travel programs as a way to cut employee health care costs.  Such proposals have raised stormy debates between employers and [[trade union]]s representing workers, with one union stating that it deplored the "shocking new approach" of offering employees overseas treatment in return for a share of the company's savings.  The unions also raise the issues of [[legal liability]] should something go wrong, and potential job losses in the US health care industry if treatment is [[outsourcing|outsourced]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/11/business/worldbusiness/11health.html Union Disrupts Plan to Send Ailing Workers to India for Cheaper Medical Care], [[The New York Times]]</ref>

Employers may offer incentives such as paying for air travel and waiving out-of-pocket expenses for care outside of the US. For example, in January 2008, Hannaford Bros., a supermarket chain based in Maine, began paying the entire medical bill for employees to travel to Singapore for hip and knee replacements, including travel for the patient and companion.<ref>McGinley, Laurie,

==Subfields==

===Dental===
{{Main|Dental tourism}}
''Dental tourism'' involves individuals seeking [[dental care]] outside of their local healthcare systems. Over 60,000 UK patients have already travelled abroad in 2011 with majority of them choosing dental treatments across Hungary, Poland and Turkey.<ref name="Medical Tourism highlights"/> Slovakia, Czech Republic and Romania are another rising destinations for dental tourism.  The number one reason for travelling abroad was the price difference, patients on average saved 50%-70% of the treatment costs. 

However, for patients with small amount of dental work or other medical difficulties such as heart, blood, respiratory or mobility problems dental tourism might not be the best option given the required travelling costs and risks associated with flying. If patients are in need of a major dental restoration or reconstruction involving dental implants, a bone graft or a full smile makeover, then there is a huge potential to make great savings and have better access to excellent dental doctors and top-level facilities and dental tourism can be great mean to achieve these goals.

===Fertility===
{{Main|Fertility tourism}}
''Fertility tourism'' is the practice of traveling to another country for fertility treatments.<ref>{{cite web|author=Paul McFedries |url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/fertilitytourism.asp |title=fertility tourism |publisher=Word Spy |date=2006-05-17 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> The main reasons for fertility tourism are legal regulation of the sought procedure in the home country, or lower price. [[In-vitro fertilization]], [[donor insemination]] and [[surrogacy]] are major procedures involved.

However, Albert Einstein Jewish Hospital in São Paulo was the first JCI-accredited facility outside of the US,<ref>[http://www.einstein.br/ingles/ Why opt for the Albert Einstein Jewish Hospital]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> and more than a dozen Brazilian medical facilities have since been similarly accredited.<ref name="JCI"/> Brazil requires visas for US citizens based on a reciprocal arrangement since Brazilians are required to obtain a visa to visit the US. Unlike in the U.S and other countries where medical procedures are simply done in an office, Plastic surgery in Brazil is done only in specialized clinics or hospitals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmeticvacations.com/pressroom/pressroom.php |title=Press Room News Releases Medical Tourism Plastic Surgery |publisher=CosmeticVacations |date= |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref>

====Canada====
[[Canada]] has entered the medical tourism field.  In comparison to US health costs, medical tourism patients can save 30 to 60 percent on health costs in Canada.<ref>[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/subscriber/business/local/story/4089007p-4687597c.html Surgery in Canada Marketed to U.S. Patients]{{Dead link|date=December 2010}}, Winnipeg Free Press, Dec 6, 2007</ref>

====Colombia====
[[Colombia]] is most likely the most underestimated destination for Global Healthcare in the Americas. Struggling with security and drug-related issues more than 15 years ago, [[Colombia]] is today one of the most thriving economies in South America and safe for tourists.<ref>[http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/pa/pa_1766.html Current Travel Warnings], Bureau of Consular Affairs, US State Department, Dec 30, 2011</ref> [[Colombia]]'s major cities like [[Bogota]], [[Medellin]], [[Cali]] and [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] are already receiving more than 1.45 million tourist each year and the numbers are increasing.<ref>[https://www.mincomercio.gov.co/publicaciones.php?id=16590 Tourism Statistics Colombia], Ministry of Commerce and Tourism, Colombia, Dec 30, 2011</ref>
Global Healthcare has been identified as one of the main drivers for economic growth in the medical sector. Patients from the Caribbean already know [[Colombia]] as a first class destination for medical procedures and cosmetic treatments. Now hospitals and facilitators are beginning to successfully convince also US-Americans of the quality of medical services provided in the country. An independent platform to compare the quality and prices of medical and cosmetic services is being supported by the government's export agency and regional initiatives.<ref>[http://www.flyclinic.com FlyClinic - Global Medical Services], Comparison Platform for Global Healthcare, Colombia</ref>
Colombia is overcoming its stigma and becoming a major player in Global Healthcare, serving needs of patients all over the Americas.

====Costa Rica====
Costa Rica's popularity in the medical tourism industry has been growing steadily over the years. Currently there are 3 [[Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations#International accreditation|Joint Commission International]] accredited (JCI) Hospitals all of which are in San Jose, Costa Rica.  Recently announced by JCI accredited Clinica Biblica, is a $40 million dollar hospital in Guanacaste designed to target the influx of medical tourism arriving in the Liberia International airport every year. This will make for a total of over six major private hospitals and 22 public hospitals. When the World Health Organization (WHO) ranked the world’s health systems in the year 2000, Costa Rica was ranked as no. 36, which was higher than the U.S., and together with Dominica it dominated the list amongst the Central American countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imtj.com/news/?entryid82=290909&source=email&campaign=imtj_news_110527 |title=South Korea wants to expand medical tourism beyond cosmetic surgery |publisher=Imtj.com |date=2009-05-08 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref>

Costa Rica offers these levels of care ranging from Intermediate Life Saving capabilities, Complex Life Saving Treatment Capabilities, Advanced Life Savings Treatment Capabilities, and Life Style Treatment Services (Full range of dental work and cosmetic surgery).<ref>[http://www.traveling4health.org/best-places/costa-rica/Medical-Tourism Medical Treatments in Costa Rica] Traveling4Health inc</ref>

Costa Rica's proximity to the U.S. helps attract over 48,000 patients a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.costamedicaltourism.com/news/fourth-international-medical-tourism-congress-2013.html |title=Costa Rica to host 250 companies for fourth International Medical Tourism Congres|publisher=www.costamedicaltourism.com |date=2013-03-17 |accessdate=2013-03-17}}</ref> The Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, in their 2009 report "Medical Tourism Consumers in Search of Value" reported cost savings average of between 30-70% of US prices.<ref>[http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-Croatia/Local%20Assets/Documents/hr_Medical_tourism(3).pdf Medical Tourism Consumers in Search of Value] 2008 Deloitte Development LLC</ref>

====Cuba====
Cuba has been a popular medical tourism destination for more than 40 years. Thousands of patients travel to Cuba, particularly from Latin America and Europe, attracted by the "fine reputation of Cuban doctors, the low prices and nearby beaches on which to recuperate."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1535358.stm "CubasMedicalSuccess"],
BBC News, September 10, 2001. Retrieved July 20, 2007.</ref> In 2006, Cuba attracted nearly 20,000 medical tourists.<ref>[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html "Commentary: A Novel Tourism Concept"], Caribbean Net News, August 18, 2007. Retrieved August 18, 2007.</ref>

Medical treatments included joint replacement, cancer treatment, eye surgery, cosmetic surgery and addictions rehabilitation. Costs are about 60 to 80 percent less than US costs.

Cuba has hospitals for Cuban residents and others that focus on serving foreigners and diplomats. In the 2007 American documentary film, ''[[Sicko]]'', which criticizes the US healthcare system, producer [[Michael Moore]] leads a group of uninsured American patients to Cuba to obtain more affordable medical treatment.  ''Sicko'' has greatly increased foreigners' interest in Cuban healthcare.  A recent [[Miami Herald]] story focused on the high quality of health care that Canadian and American medical tourism patients receive in Cuba.<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/548/v-print/story/263172.html "Canadian Firms Offer Cuban Healthcare to US, Canadian Patients"], Miami Herald, October 7, 2007. Retrieved October 31, 2007.</ref>

The Cuban government has developed Cuban medical tourism to generate income for the country.  Residents of Canada, the UK and most other countries can travel to Cuba without any difficulty, although a tourist visa is generally required.  For Americans, however, because of the US trade policy towards Cuba, travelers must either obtain US government approval, or, more frequently, travel to Cuba from Canada, Mexico, the Bahamas,
To date no Cuban facility has achieved JCI Accreditation.<ref name="JCI">{{cite web|url=http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/JCI-Accredited-Organizations/ |title=(JCI) Accredited Organizations |publisher=Joint Commission International |date= |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref>

====Mexico====
Americans, particularly those living near the Mexican border, now routinely cross to Mexico for medical care.<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/nationworld/stories/072807dninthospitals.36608c1.html U.S. patients choosing Mexican hospitals for price, quality], ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', July 20, 2007</ref><ref name="NYTimes">Philip J.

Mexican dentists often charge one-fifth to one-fourth of US prices,<ref name="WashPost"/> while other procedures typically cost a third what they would in the US.<ref name="NYTimes"/>

In Texas, legislators explored the possibility of allowing health maintenance organizations to operate on both sides of the border. However, physicians in south Texas lobbied against the changes, arguing that local doctors could not compete with the lower costs in Mexico".<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/11/13/california_health_costs_send_patients_to_mexico_facilities/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=California health costs send patients to Mexico facilities | date=November 13, 2005 | first1=Sonya | last1=Geis | first2=Washington | last2=Post}}</ref> US doctors point out that the Mexican legal system makes it almost impossible to sue Mexican doctors for malpractice.<ref name="WashPost">Manuel Roig-Franzia, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/17/AR2007061701297.html Discount Dentistry, South of The Border], Washingtonpost.com, June 18, 2007.

However, many who travel to Mexico for care report that they are satisfied.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> According to a report commissioned by Families U.S.A., a Washington advocacy group for health-care issues, "About 90 percent [feel] the care they had received in Mexico had been good or excellent. About 80 percent rated the care they had received in the United States as good or excellent".<ref name="NYTimes" />

Indeed "some U.S. dentists ... have conceded to the competition and begun a 'reverse migration' opening offices in Mexico to take advantage of lower costs".<ref name="WashPost"/>  More American insurers are providing coverage for travelers, as the out-of-pocket costs to them are much lower. "With healthcare costs in the United States continuing to rise, many employers in Southern California are turning to insurance plans that send their workers to Mexico for routine care, plans that are growing by nearly 3,000 people a year."

Tijuana has proven to be a convenient center for 'medical tourism'.  Due to its strategic geographic location, patients from California and much of the west coast have turned to Tijuana for elective procedures as well as for others such as chemotherapy, among others.  According to the San Diego Union Tribune, about 1 million Californians go to Mexico for healthcare, and most of these patients go to Tijuana.<ref>{{cite web|first=San Diego Union Tribune|title=Health-care challenged Californians flocking to Mexico

In addition to dental and plastic surgery, Mexican hospitals are popular for bariatric surgery for weight loss, considered an elective procedure that is not covered by some US insurers. A popular bariatric procedure, lap band surgery, which was approved by the FDA in the US in 2001, has been performed for longer by Mexican surgeons.<ref>See also

====Panama====
In [[Panama]], health and medical tourism is growing rapidly.  Factors drawing medical tourists include Panama's tourist appeal, position as a hub for international travel, and use of the American dollar as the official currency.  Many of Panama’s doctors are bilingual, board certified, and accustomed to working with the same medical equipment and technology used in the United States and Europe. On most procedures, Panama offers savings of more than 50% compared to the US and Europe.<ref name="Gahlinger2008"/> No Panamanian hospitals currently have international healthcare accreditation, whether through US, British, Australian or Canadian sources.

====United States====

Several major medical centers and teaching hospitals offer international patient centers that cater to patients from foreign countries who seek medical treatment in the U.S.<ref>[http://stanfordhospital.org/forPatients/patientServices/internationalMedicalServices.html International Medical Services], [[Stanford Hospital|Stanford Hospital & Clinics]]</ref> Many of these organizations offer service coordinators to assist international patients with arrangements for medical care, accommodations, finances and transportation including [[air ambulance]] services.

====China====
China is fast emerging as a desirable destination for individuals seeking medical care in a wide range of medical specialties, including cardiology, neurology, orthopedics and others.  A number of private and government hospitals in major cities have established international departments.  Many leading hospitals provide treatments integrating Traditional Chinese Medicine with Western medical technology and techniques.<ref>{{cite web|last=Einhorn |first=Bruce |url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2008/gb2008119_464684.htm?chan=globalbiz_special+report+--+asia+medical+tourism_special+report+-+asia+medical+tourism |title=A Traditional Chinese Alternative to U.S. Hospitals |publisher=BusinessWeek |date=2008-11-09 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}</ref>  China is home to leading stem cell research and treatment hospitals that offer Westerners who want to take advantage of stem cell treatments that are still considered experimental or have yet to be approved in their home country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071129/LIFESTYLE03/711290381 |title=More travel abroad for stem cell therapy |publisher=The Detroit News |date= |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22455125/ |title=Americans seek stem cell treatments in China - Cloning and stem cells |publisher=MSNBC |date=2008-01-06 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref>

=====Hong Kong=====
As of 2006, [[Hong Kong]] had 12 private hospitals and 39 public hospitals, providing 3,124 and 27,755 beds respectively. A wide range of health care services are offered. All 12 of Hong Kong's private hospitals have been surveyed and accredited by the UK's Trent Accreditation Scheme since early 2001.<ref>[http://www.1stor.co.uk/trentaccreditationscheme.org/news/tasnews6-200110.pdf Trent Accreditation Scheme Newsletter], Iss. 6, 2001</ref> This has been a major factor in the ascent of standards in Hong Kong's private hospitals. The Trent scheme works closely with the hospitals it assesses to generate standards appropriate to the locality (with respect to culture, geography, public health, primary care interfaces etc.), and always uses combinations of UK-sourced and Hong Kong-sourced surveyors. Some of Hong Kong's private hospitals have now gone on to obtain dual international accreditation, with both Trent and JCI (and have therefore attained a standard surpassing some of the best hospitals in Thailand and Singapore). Others are looking towards dual international accreditation with Trent and the Australian group. Hong Kong public hospitals have yet to commit to external accreditation.

Other patients, mainly of Pakistani origin, especially from the Middle East, United Kingdom and United States, also travel to Pakistan to seek a range of treatments which they cannot otherwise get in their resident countries either due to expensiveness or lack of insurance cover there; common treatments that these patients seek include cardiac surgery, infertility treatments and cosmetic surgery. In the past, a sizable number of global patients traveled to Pakistan for kidney transplants although these cases have dropped ever since a legislation came into place that sought to regulate the illegal trade of selling kidneys.<ref name="et"/> According to Pakistani medical experts, medical tourism is still an untapped market that can be turned into a huge opportunity if the government "focuses on key issues".<ref name="et">{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/365757/untapped-market-can-pakistan-become-a-hub-for-medical-tourism/|title=Untapped market: Can Pakistan become a hub for medical tourism?|work=Express Tribune|date=17 April 2012|accessdate=18 April 2012}}</ref>

====Philippines====
The [[Philippines]] has been growing as a destination for medical tourism. The US Medical Tourism Association magazine reported that this services sub-sector grew 8.0% in 2007.<ref>[http://www.asianjournal.com/?c=186&a=30335 asianjournal.com, RP Medical tourism to get big push]</ref>
The number can be expected to grow as American health-care costs rise, or if pending legislation results in an increase in patient wait times for surgical procedures (as has been seen in other countries where care has been nationalized), due to the traditional political, economic and cultural connections between the United States and the Philippines.   International accreditation of hospitals has increased, and QHA Trent has now accredited hospitals in the Philippines.

The Philippines is one of a few countries that sends qualified nurses, physicians and dentists to the US, the thousands serving in American medical facilities being a testament to its quality of medical education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/1550.html |title=IMGs by Country of Origin |publisher=Ama-assn.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jada.ada.org/cgi/content/full/138/2/219 |title=Foreign-trained dentists licensed in the United States: Exploring their origins - Sweis and Guay 138 (2): 219 - The Journal of the American Dental Association |publisher=Jada.ada.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-15}}</ref> Many also work in the UK.

Patients come from neighboring countries, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, and patient numbers from Indochina, South Asia, the Middle East and Greater China are growing. Patients from developed countries such as the United States and the UK are also beginning to choose Singapore as their medical travel destination for relatively affordable health care services in a clean cosmopolitan city.

Singapore recently launched the region’s first cardiology clinic catering especially for the needs of women. This is in recognition of the fact that cardiovascular disease (heart disease and stroke) is the top killer among women in Singapore and in many other countries in the Asia Pacific. The Women’s Heart Health Clinic is located in the National University Hospital. Its emphasis is on prevention as well as treatment. Women are treated by an all-women team comprising a cardiologist, dietician (heart-healthy diet), occupational therapists (lifestyle management) and physiotherapist (exercise prescription).<ref>[Channel News Asia. 15 March 2011. http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1116703/1/.html.

====Taiwan====
The Taiwanese government has declared its determination for the country to become a medical tourism center. In 2007, the Department of Health launched a campaign to promote inbound medical tourism, focusing on integrating the resources of the government and academia to build Taiwan's brand as a medical tourism destination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imtj.com/news/?EntryId82=172651 |title=Taiwan government to promote inbound medical tourism |publisher=Imtj.com |date=2009-05-08 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}</ref> Costs for procedures remain comparatively low. [[Taiwan]] is known for liver transplants, joint replacement surgery, bone marrow transplants, and reconstructive and plastic surgery.

====Thailand====
Medical tourism has been a growing segment of [[Thailand]]'s tourism and health-care sectors. In 2005, one Bangkok hospital took in 150,000 treatment seekers from abroad. In 2006, medical tourism was projected to earn the country 36.4 billion [[baht]].<ref>[http://www.expresshospitality.com/20060630/market08.shtml "Medical Tourism: Hidden dimensions"] by Rabindra Seth, ''Express Hospitality'', June, 2006. Retrieved September 12, 2006.</ref>

Treatments for medical tourists in Thailand range from cosmetic, organ transplants, cardiac, and orthopaedic treatments to dental and cardiac surgeries. Treatments also include [[spa in Thailand|spa]], physical and mental therapies, as well as procedures that are considered more along the lines of fringe medical practices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thailawforum.com/medical-practices-thailand-stem-cell-cloning-cancer-sex-change.html |title=Thailand Sex Change Surgery &#124; Stem Cell Research &#124; Cloning in Thailand |publisher=Thailawforum.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> One patient who had [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] at [[Bumrungrad International]] hospital in Bangkok said the operation cost him [[United States dollar|US]]$12,000 (8,200 euros), as opposed to the $100,000 (68,000 euros) he estimated the operation would have cost him at home.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/04/21/60minutes/main689998.shtml "Vacation, Adventure And Surgery?"] ''[[60 Minutes|CBS News: 60 Minutes]]'', September 4, 2005.

====Japan====
To promote medical tourism, the Japanese government issues six-month entry visas to travelers entering Japan to receive medical care, double the duration of regular tourist visas.  An estimated two percent of foreign visitors to Japan came for medical care.  Japan's medical system is reportedly strong in the area of cancer treatment.<ref>Aoki, Mizuho, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120605i1.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+japantimes+(The+Japan+Times%3A+All+Stories) Medical tourism — a boat to be on]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 5 June 2012, p. 3</ref>

===Europe===
<!-- do not add a country subsection unless you can cite a reliable source.  Medical tourism blogs are not reliable sources. -->

Countries in Europe that have active medical tourism sectors include [[Turkey]], [[Romania]], [[Cyprus]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Estonia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Malta]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Spain]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Ukraine]].

In 2006 it was ruled that under the conditions of the E112 European health scheme, UK health authorities had to pay the bill if one of their patients could establish urgent medical reasons for seeking quicker treatment in another European union country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thompsons.law.co.uk/clinical-negligence/nhs-waiting-lists-targets.htm |title=NHS Waiting lists: targets and England&Wales comparison |publisher=Thompsons.law.co.uk |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref>

====Bulgaria====
[[Bulgaria]] is a member of European Union since 2007,<ref>{{cite web |title=European Union Members-Bulgaria|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/bulgaria/index_en.htm}}</ref> which helps medical tourists from Europe reduce their travel costs.  Bulgarian standard of living is lower in comparison with other developing European countries. However, this fact is significant for its lower prices for providing health care services. On the other hand, Bulgarian physicians are highly qualified and have specialized in renowned Bulgarian and international universities. There are a number of modernly equipped hospitals, clinics and medical centers, therefore, health services in Bulgaria offer excellent combination of high value and state of the art medical care offered at competitive pricing.

The biggest private hospital in Bulgaria [[Tokuda Hospital]] Sofia, which is a member of Tokushukai Medical Corporation and Cambridge University Hospitals affiliated, have served over 8,000 international patients<ref>{{cite web |title=Medical Tourism at Tokuda Hospital|url=http://www.tokudabolnica.bg/en/page/813/Medical_Tourism}}</ref> EU, Russia and the former republics, and the Middle East for the past five years.

The unique combination of highly qualified medical care at competitive price and the numerous places of interest in Bulgaria give the opportunity to combine travel for health reason with recreational, balneological, historical, religious, pilgrim, adventurous tourism and many others. Spa tourism in Bulgaria is very well developed, thanks to the great number of mineral and thermal springs and the modern facility infrastructure of Bulgarian tourism.

====Czech Republic====
[[Czech Republic]] has built its medical tourism on spas and medical care equalling the world standards (for example Ostrava University Hospital). The Czech Republic is well known for its affordable and high quality medical treatment. The most of Czech doctors studied at Charles University in Prague which was founded in 1348. Back in the 14th century it was the first university in Central Europe region and currently it is one of the oldest universities in Europe. The study demands enormous attention to practical training in combination with a broad theoretical knowledge. As a result the medical education in Prague is honored abroad as one of the top in the world.

====Cyprus====
[[Cyprus]] is actively developing its medical tourism industry.  Currently very few hospitals have independent accreditation.

====Estonia====
[[Estonia]] is particularly popular among Scandinavians for medical tourism. The medical tourism industry achieves world standards and has to comply with EU regulation since it joined the EU in 2004. Estonia is known for its good medical care and scored particularly high in the Health Consumer Powerhouse report, produced on behalf of the European Union.<ref>http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/ECHCI_2008_Full_Report_final.pdf</ref>

====France====
British NHS patients have been offered treatment in [[France]] to reduce waiting lists for hip, knee and cataract surgery since 2002.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1770348.stm | work=BBC News | title=NHS patients recover after surgery abroad | date=January 19, 2002}}</ref> France is a popular tourist destination but also ranked the world's leading health care system. This ranking reflects the expertise offered by doctors and surgeons to patients cared for in France. The French National Authority for Health (HAS) issues high-level quality requirements for French health care, with which clinics and hospitals must comply in order to be accredited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.france-surgery.com/en/clinics-and-hospitals.php |title=Why choose France for medical treatment ? |publisher=France-surgery.com |date=2011-02-18 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref>

====Germany====
[[Germany]] is a destination for patients seeking advanced medical technology, high standards, safety, and quick treatment.<ref>Boscher, L (2009) „European Legends – More to come“ (Online) The Medical Tourism Magazine. Available: http://www.medicaltourismmag.com/issue-detail.php?item=181&issue=8</ref>
All German citizens have health coverage,<ref>NPR (2008) Compare International Medical Bills (online) Available: http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=110997469 (accessed: 7 October 2009)</ref> resulting in a high hospital density, with twice as many hospitals per capita as the United States.<ref>Osterkamp, R. (2002) „Warten auf Operationen“ – Ein Internationaler Vergleich“, IFO Schnelldients, vol. 55 no. 10, pp. 14-21 (online).

Costs for medical treatment compete well with other developed European countries and are commonly 50% of those in the USA.<ref>NPR (2008) Compare International Medical Bills (online) Availalble: http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=110997469 (accessed: 7 October 2009)</ref>

Germany is an attractive destination for patients from the Middle East since traveling to the USA has become more difficult for them since the [[September 11 attacks]]. US citizens sometimes travel to Germany to seek treatments such as artificial cervical disc replacement that are not US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved.

====Hungary====
Because of an advantageous geographical location thermal water can be found with good quality and in great quantities on over 80% of [[Hungary]]'s territory. Approximately 1,500 thermal springs can be found in Hungary. There are approximately 450 public baths in Hungary.

The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] heralded the first age of spa in Hungary, the remains of their bath complexes are still to be seen in [[Óbuda]], to this day. The spa culture was revived during the [[Ottoman Invasion of Hungary]] who used the thermal springs of [[Buda]] for the construction of a number of bathhouses, some of which are still functioning ([[Király Baths]], [[Rudas Baths]]).

In the 19th century the advancement in deep drilling and medical science provided the springboard for a further leap in bathing culture. Grand spas such as [[Gellért Baths]], Lukács Baths, [[Margaret Island]], and [[Széchenyi Medicinal Bath]] are a reflection of this resurgence in popularity.

====Lithuania====
[[Lithuania]] is one of several countries actively promoting medical tourism.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/healthcare/medicaltourism.html | work=CBC News}}</ref> Treatments involve cosmetic surgery, eye surgery, and other services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medic8.com/medical-tourism/country/lithuania.html |title=Lithuania - A guide to Medical Tourism |publisher=Medic8.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref>

====Poland====
Since 2004, when [[Poland]] joined the [[European Union]], it has become another locale for people seeking cheaper medical treatments.<ref>A.P. Lubowiecki-Vikuk, 2011, Turystyka medyczna jako produkt eksportowy polskiej gospodarki (Medical Tourism as an export product in polish economy). Ekonomiczne Problemy Usług, 79 p.125-136.</ref> The quality of care in Poland must comply with EU standards. <!-- Source of this assertion -->

====Romania====
[[Romania]] is a member state of the [[European Union]]. Medical tourism services in [[Romania]] varied but cover a large scope. The quality of services is implemented by both national and EU bodies of accreditation. Medical tourism in Romania is quality driven as outlined in the Medical Tourism Magazine, issue 18.<ref>[http://www.medicaltourismmag.com/detail.php?Req=390&issue=18] Quality Medical Holidays - Cuntry Focus on Romania</ref>

The private healthcare system in Romania is amongst the most dynamic in the country in terms of investments and growth. Market reports state that growth can still be expected in the private system in the years to come.<ref>[http://www.slideshare.net/JackieBP/the-romanian-market-of-private-medical-services-2009] FRD CENTER MARKET ENTRY SERVICES ROMANIA</ref>

There are facilitators in Romania helping traveling patients access services, both medical and touristic services.

====Turkey====
[[Turkey]] attracts medical tourists from Europe and the Balkans, the United States, Eurasia and the Middle East, hosting about 200,000 patients annually.<ref>[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=americans-prefer-turkey-for-low-cost-health-services-2009-08-17] Americans prefer Turkey for low-cost health services (Hurriyet Daily News, August 17, 2009)</ref>

Over 34 hospitals and medical institutions have achieved Joint Commission International accreditation.<ref>[http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/JCI-Accredited-Organizations/#Turkey] (Joint Commission International Accredited Organizations, August 18, 2009)</ref>

In Turkey, all medical tourism activities will be distributed to all the activities to which the Ministry of Health participate overseas and within the country, to the culture and tourism directorates in provinces and to the offices in the country by Culture and Tourism Ministry, to all the activities held abroad and in the country the Medical Tourism Association and OHSAD (Private Hospitals and Medical Institutions Association ) take part to, to the representatives of TUMSIAD<ref>[http://www.tumsiad.org.tr/tr/news.asp?ID=519] (Industrial and Businessmen Association)</ref> in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Austria, Iran, Jordan, Syria, Kosovo, Macedonia and Bosnia, with a view to promote the Turkish health services.

====United Kingdom====
The United Kingdom is one of the most active of medical tourism destinations, especially London.<ref>[http://www.imtj.com/articles/2009/the-forgotten-medical-tourism-destination-30026/?locale=en The forgotten medical tourism destination]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imtj.com/news/?EntryId82=285641 |title=UK: New London agency could promote medical tourism |date=20 April 2011}}</ref> Nevertheless, as at the present time very few UK private hospitals have gone through independent international accreditation (they only have the mandatory registration with the UK's watchdog, the Care Quality Commission), so they have not as yet measured themselves against the best clinics and hospitals elsewhere in the world.
