'''Carol Friedman''' is a scientist and [[Health informatics|biomedical informatician]]. She is among the pioneers the use of expert systems in  [[Natural language processing|Medical language processing]] and the explicit [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|medical concept representation]] underpinning the use of [[Entity–attribute–value model]]ing underpinning [[Electronic health records|electronic medical records]]. Before her doctoral degree, working under the direction of Naomi Sager at New York University, she also contributed to the development  of second generation [[Natural language processing|Medical language processing]] systems. After her doctoral degree in computer science (natural language processing) under Dr. Ralph Grishman at the Courant Institute of Mathematics at New York University, she has developed annotative clinical information systems that have been integrated in the [[New York–Presbyterian Hospital]], and the [[Columbia University Medical Center]] . She is recognized for her development, translation to clinical practice and evaluation of the MedLEE <ref>http://www.cat.columbia.edu/medlee.htm</ref> [[Natural language processing|Medical language processing]] system. MedLEE is in daily use for clinical decision support at [[NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital]]. She adapted and evaluated the MEdLEE system to build biomolecular  and genotype-phenotype networks (GENIES<ref>http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/suppl_1/S74.long</ref> and BioMedLEE<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3041541/</ref> respectively). MedLEE and GENIES exemplify the translation to practice of the sub-language theory<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellig_Harris#Sublanguage_and_linguistic_information</ref> proposed by [[Zellig Harris]] that Dr. Friedman pursued. In summary, she has been demonstrating the value of natural language processing for a broad range of clinical and biomedical applications that include decision support, automated encoding, vocabulary development, sub-language grammar applied to biomedicine, clinical research, outcomes analysis, error detection, and genomics research. 
Currently, Dr. Friedman is Professor of Biomedical Informatics at [[Columbia University]]. Dr. Friedman was a member of the Board of Regents of the National Library of Medicine from 2007–11 and has published over 150 articles.
