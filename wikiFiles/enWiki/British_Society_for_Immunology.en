The '''British Society for Immunology''', or '''BSI''', is a [[UK]] based organisation of British [[immunology|immunologists]] but accepts members from all countries. It was founded in 1956 and is one of the oldest and largest Immunology societies in the world and the largest in Europe. It publishes two [[scientific journals]]: ''[[Immunology (journal)|Immunology]]'' and ''[[Clinical and Experimental Immunology]]''.

BSI members work throughout the entire [[Immunology]] chain, stretching from the laboratory bench right through to the clinics and hospitals in which patients are treated - from discovery to delivery. The fields in which they work are wide and extensive, from [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] to [[allergy]], [[diabetes]], [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]], [[animal health]], [[arthritis]], [[Organ transplantation|transplantation]], [[vaccination]] and [[infectious disease]]. 

The BSIâ€™s main objective is to promote and support excellence in research, scholarship and clinical practice in [[immunology]] for the benefit of human and animal [[health]] and welfare. The BSI seeks to help British Immunology accomplish the highest possible goals. 

To meet this objective, the BSI undertakes the following:

* Running innovative events in research, public engagement and education
* Promoting and disseminating research and good practice in Immunology, translational medicine and vaccination
* Working with its members to develop the benefits of membership and the relevance of the Society
* Providing bursaries and grants
* Enhancing public awareness of immunology
* Influencing policy and decision makers
* Working with other societies

The current General Secretary is Professor David Gray ([[University of Edinburgh]])

The Board of Trustees is composed of: Dr Lindsay Nicholson, Dr David Morgan (both [[University of Bristol]]), Professor Robert Barker ([[University of Aberdeen]]), Professor Arne Akbar ([[University College London]]), Professor Tracy Hussell ([[Imperial College London]]), Dr Stephen Jolles ([[Cardiff University]]), Professor Adrian Hayday ([[King's College London]]) and Professor Paul Lehner ([[University of Cambridge]])
