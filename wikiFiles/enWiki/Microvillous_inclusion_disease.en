'''Microvillus inclusion disease''', also known as '''Davidson's disease''', '''congenital microvillus atrophy''' and, less specifically, '''microvillus atrophy''' (note: microvillus is often misspelled as microvillous), is a rare [[genetic disorder]] of the [[small intestine]] that is inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern.<ref name="chehade">{{Cite book

This results in [[metabolic acidosis]] and severe [[dehydration]]. Pregnancy and birth are usually normal.

==Prognosis==
It is nearly always fatal unless, like short bowel syndrome patients, treated with [[parenteral nutrition]] or an [[intestinal transplant]].<ref name="salvatore"/> The patient is often classified as being in "intestinal failure" and treated with the cohort of patients known as "short bowel syndrome" patients.

==Pathophysiology==
It is caused by a congenital lack of apical [[microvilli]] in the [[epithelial cells]] of the small intestine.<ref>{{Cite book

==Diagnosis==
Prenatal  screening ''[[in utero]]'' is currently offered by several medical centers since the [[gene]](s) involved in the disease were  recently discovered to be [[MYO5B]];<ref name=mueller>{{cite journal |author=Mueller T|title=MYO5B mutations cause microvillus inclusion disease and disrupt epithelial cell polarity |journal=Nat Genet |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1163–5 |year=2008 |pmid=18724368 |doi=10.1038/ng.225 |last2=Hess |first2=MW |last3=Schiefermeier |first3=N |last4=Pfaller |first4=K |last5=Ebner |first5=HL |last6=Heinz-Erian |first6=P |last7=Ponstingl |first7=H |last8=Partsch |first8=J |last9=Röllinghoff |first9=B }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Szperl A, Golachowska M, Rings E, IJzendoorn S, et al | title=Functional characterization of mutations in the myosin Vb gene associated with microvillus inclusion disease. | year=2011 | journal=[[JPGN|J Ped Gastroenterol Nutr]] | doi= | volume=52 | pmid=21206382 | pages=307–13}}</ref> Diagnosis is typically made by [[biopsy]] of the small intestine.<ref name=chehade/>

===Biopsy===
The appearance of microvillous inclusion disease on [[light microscopy]] is similar to [[celiac sprue]]; however, it usually lacks the intraepithelial [[lymphocyte|lymphocytic]] infiltration characteristic of celiac sprue and stains positive for [[carcinoembryonic antigen]] (CEA).<ref name=sternbergs/>  
The definitive diagnosis is dependent on [[electron microscopy]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kennea N, Norbury R, Anderson G, Tekay A |title=Congenital microvillous inclusion disease presenting as antenatal bowel obstruction |journal=Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=172–4 |year=2001 |pmid=11251929 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-0705.2001.00211.x}}</ref>

===Differential diagnosis===

==Genetic prevalence==

[[File:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Microvillous inclusion disease has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.]]

Microvillous inclusion disease is thought to be extremely rare; only approximately 200 cases have been identified in children in Europe.<ref>{{OMIM|251850|Microvillous atrophy}}</ref> 

One patient, a teenage female living in Arizona, suddenly began to grow microvilli after thirteen years of TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) and Lipid dependency. She now enjoys a typical teenage diet and is seen regularly by her Gastroenterologist.

One patient from the UK was documented to achieve nutritional independence at age 3.<ref name=croft>{{cite journal |author=Croft NM|title=Microvillous inclusion disease: An evolving Condition |journal=J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=185–189 |year=2000 |pmid=10941974 |last2=Howatson |first2=AG |last3=Ling |first3=SC |last4=Nairn |first4=L |last5=Evans |first5=TJ |last6=Weaver |first6=LT }}</ref>

On 26 June 2009 a six year old girl diagnosed with microvillous inclusion disease became the third person in the UK to die of swine flu.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/8126095.stm | work=BBC News | title=Swine flu girl 'had tough life' | date=30 June 2009 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref>

==History==
Microvillous inclusion disease was first described in 1978 by Davidson et al.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davidson GP, Cutz E, Hamilton JR, Gall DG |title=Familial enteropathy: a syndrome of protracted diarrhea from birth, failure to thrive, and hypoplastic villus atrophy |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=75 |issue=5 |pages=783–90 |year=1978 |pmid=100367 |doi=}}</ref>  It was originally described as ''familial enteropathy''.
