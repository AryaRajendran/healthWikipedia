'''Intravenous [[Fluorescein]] [[angiography]] (IVFA)''' or '''fluorescent angiography''' is a technique for examining the circulation of the [[retina]] and [[choroid]] using a fluorescent dye and a specialized camera.  It involves injection of sodium [[fluorescein]]<ref>{{MeshName|Fluorescein+Angiography}}</ref> into the systemic circulation, and then an [[angiogram]] is obtained by photographing the [[fluorescence]] emitted after illumination of the retina with blue light at a [[wavelength]] of 490 [[nanometer]]s.  The test uses the [[dye tracing]] method.  

The fluorescein dye also reappears in the patient urine, causing the urine to appear darker, and sometimes orange.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fluorescein angiography|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003846.htm|work=U.S. National Library of Medicine|publisher=MedLine Plus|accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref>  It can also cause discolouration of the saliva.

Fluorescein angiography is one of several [[health care]] applications of this dye, all of which have a risk of severe [[adverse effect]]s.  See [[Fluorescein#Safety|fluorescein safety in health care applications]].  Fluorescein angiography does not involve the use of [[ionizing radiation]].<ref name=WillsEye4th />

==Equipment==
*'''Exciter filter:''' Allows only  blue light to illuminate the retina.  Depending on the specific filter, the excitation wavelength hitting the retina will be between 465-490&nbsp;nm. Most only allow light through at a wavelength of 490&nbsp;nm. 
*'''[[Barrier filter]]:''' Allows only yellow-green light (from the fluorescence) to reach the camera. Both filters are [[interference filter|interference bandpass filter]]s, which means they block out all light except that at a specific wavelength. The barrier filter only allows light with a wavelength of 525&nbsp;nm, but depending on the filter it can be anywhere from 520-530&nbsp;nm. 
*[[Fundus Camera]], either digital or with camera body containing black and white, or slide positive film.

==Technique==
*Baseline color and black and white red-free filtered images are taken prior to injection. The black and white images are filtered red-free (a green filter) to increase contrast and often gives a better image of the fundus than the color image.  

*A 6 second [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]] injection of 2-5cc of sodium fluorescein into a vein in the arm or hand.

*A series of black-and-white or digital photographs are taken of the retina before and after the fluorescein reaches the retinal circulation (approximately 10 seconds after injection). The early images allow for the recognition of autofluorescence of the retinal tissues.  Photos are taken approximately once every second for about 20 seconds, then less often.  A delayed image is obtained at 5 and 10 minutes.  Some doctors like to see a 15 minute image as well.
*A filter is placed in the camera so only the fluorescent, yellow-green light (530&nbsp;nm) is recorded.  The camera may however pick up signals from [[pseudofluorescence]] or [[autofluorescence]].  In pseudofluorescence, non-fluorescent light is imaged.  This occurs when blue light reflected from the retina passes through the filter.  This is generally a problem with older filters, and annual replacement of these filters is recommended.  In autofluorescence, fluorescence from the eye occurs without injection of the dye.  This may be seen with [http://www.revoptom.com/handbook/SECT50a.HTM optic nerve head drusen], [http://www.revoptom.com/handbook/sect6l4b.htm astrocytic hamartoma], or calcific scarring.
*Black-and-white photos give better contrast than color photos, which aren't necessary since only one color is being transmitted though the filter.

==Normal circulatory filling==
''times are approximate''
*0 seconds &mdash; injection of fluorescein
*9.5 sec &mdash; posterior ciliary arteries
*10 sec &mdash; [[choroid]]al flush (or "pre-arterial phase")
*10-12 sec &mdash; retinal arterial stage
*13 sec &mdash; [[capillary]] transition stage
*14-15 sec &mdash; early venous stage (or "lamellar stage", "arterial-venous stage")
*16-17 sec &mdash; venous stage
*18-20 sec &mdash; late venous stage
*5 minutes &mdash; late staining

Fluorescein enters the ocular circulation from the [[internal carotid artery]] via the [[ophthalmic artery]]. The ophthalmic artery supplies the choroid via the short posterior ciliary arteries and the retina via the [[retinal artery|central retinal artery]], however, the route to the choroid is typically less circuitous than the route to the retina. This accounts for the short delay between the "choroidal flush" and retinal filling.

==Pathologic findings==
Pathologic changes are recognized by the detection of either '''hyperfluorescence''' or '''hypofluroescence'''.  

'''Causes of hyperfluorescence:'''
:leaking defects (i.e. capillary leakage, [[aneurysm]], [[neovascularization]])
:pooling defects
:staining 
:transmission (filling) defects
:abnormal vasculature

'''Causes of hypofluorescence:'''
:blocking defect (i.e. blood)
:filling defect (capillary blockage)

Fluorescein angiography is used by physicians specializing in the treatment of eye diseases ([[ophthalmologists]]) to evaluate the vasculature of the [[retina]], [[choroid]], [[optic disc]], and [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]].<ref name=WillsEye4th />  Among the common groups of ophthalmologic disease, fluorescein angiography can detect [[diabetic retinopathy]] ([[neovascularization]]), vein occlusions, [[retinal artery occlusion]]s,<ref>{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Vinay|title=Robbins basic pathology|year=2007|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1416029731|chapter=Chapter 29: Eye, Retina and Vitreous, Retinal Vascular Disease|edition=8th}}</ref> edema of the optic disc, and tumors.  Additionally, the transit time (the period between injection of the dye and when it appears in the examined blood vessels) can provide an objective measurement of the rate of blood flow through the imaged blood vessels.<ref name=WillsEye4th>{{cite book|last=Kunimoto|first=Derek |coauthors=Kunal Kanitkar, and Mary Makar|title=The Wills eye manual: office and emergency room diagnosis and treatment of eye disease.|year=2004|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-0781742078|pages=365|edition=4th}}</ref>
