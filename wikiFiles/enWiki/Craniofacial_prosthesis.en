'''Craniofacial prostheses''' are [[prostheses]] made by individuals trained in [[anaplastology]] or [[Prosthodontics|maxillofacial prosthodontics]] who medically help rehabilitate those suffering from facial defects caused by [[disease]] (mostly progressed forms of [[skin cancer]], and [[head and neck cancer]]), trauma ([[outer ear trauma]], [[eye trauma]]) or [[birth defects]] ([[microtia]], [[anophthalmia]]).  They have the ability to replace almost any part of the face, but most commonly is the [[ear]], [[Human nose|nose]] or [[human eye|eye]]/[[eyelids]].  An [[ocular prosthesis]] and [[hair prosthesis]] can also be classified as craniofacial prostheses.  Prostheses are held in place either by biocompatible drying [[adhesives]], [[Osseointegration|osseointegrated implants]], [[magnets]], or another mechanical form (although rare) such as glasses or straps. Prostheses are designed to be as similar as possible to the natural anatomy of each individual.  Their purpose is to cover, protect, and disguise facial disfigurements or underdevelopments.

When surgical reconstruction is not ideal, craniofacial prosthetics are favored when they can better restore the form and function of the absent facial feature.  Craniofacial prosthetics are not wholly considered [[wikt:cosmetic|cosmetic]]<ref>http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/600_699/0620.html</ref><ref>https://www.noridianmedicare.com/eula.php?t=/dme/coverage/lcd.html%3f</ref> because they replace the physical [[wikt:form|form]] and  functional [[mechanics]] of the absent anatomy and serve a significant role in the emotional stability and rehabilitation of those suffering from facial defects.
