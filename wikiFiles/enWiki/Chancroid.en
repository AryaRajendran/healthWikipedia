'''Chancroid''' (also known as '''soft chancre'''<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=|pages=274}}</ref> and '''ulcus molle'''<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>) is a bacterial [[sexually transmitted infection]] characterized by painful sores on the genitalia. Chancroid is known to spread from one individual to another solely through sexual contact.

==Causes==
Chancroid is a [[bacteria]]l [[infection]] caused by the [[Growth medium|fastidious]] [[Gram-negative]] streptobacillus ''[[Haemophilus ducreyi]]''. It is a disease found primarily in [[developing countries]], most prevalent in low socioeconomic groups, associated with commercial sex workers.

Infection levels are very low in the Western world, typically around one case per two million of the population (Canada, France, Australia, UK and US).{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Most individuals diagnosed with chancroid have visited countries or areas where the disease is known to occur frequently, although outbreaks have been observed in association with crack cocaine use and prostitution.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Chancroid is a risk factor for contracting [[HIV]], due to their ecological association or shared risk of exposure, and biologically facilitated transmission of one infection by the other.

==Pathogenesis==
[[H. ducreyi]] enters skin through microabrasions incurred during sexual intercourse. A local tissue reaction leads to development of erythomatous [[Cutaneous conditions#Primary lesions|papule]], which progresses to [[Cutaneous conditions#Primary lesions|pustule]] in 4–7 days. It then undergoes central [[necrosis]] to ulcerate.<ref name=cur>{{cite book|title=CURRENT Diagnosis & Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases|year=2007|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies,Inc.|isbn=9780071509619|pages=69–74}}</ref>

==Symptoms and signs==
[[File:Haemophilus ducreyi 5811 lores.jpg|thumb|Buboes in a male]]
These are only local and no systemic manifestations are present.<ref>{{cite book|title=Medical Microbiology: The Big Picture|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=9780071476614|pages=243}}</ref> 
The ulcer characteristically:

*Ranges in size dramatically from 3 to 50&nbsp;mm (1/8&nbsp;inch to two inches) across
*Is painful
*Has sharply defined, undermined borders
*Has irregular or ragged borders
*Has a base that is covered with a gray or yellowish-gray material
*Has a base that bleeds easily if traumatized or scraped
* painful lymphadenopathy occurs in 30 to 60% of patients.
* [[dysuria]] (pain with urination) and [[dyspareunia]] (pain with intercourse) in females

About half of infected men have only a single ulcer. Women frequently have four or more ulcers, with fewer symptoms.

The initial ulcer may be mistaken as a "hard" [[chancre]], the typical sore of primary [[syphilis]], as opposed to the "soft chancre" of chancroid.

Approximately one-third of the infected individuals will develop enlargements of the [[inguinal lymph node]]s, the nodes located in the fold between the leg and the lower abdomen.

Half of those who develop swelling of the inguinal lymph nodes will progress to a point where the nodes rupture through the skin, producing draining abscesses. The swollen lymph nodes and abscesses are often referred to as [[buboes]].

==Sites==

===Males===
* Internal and external surface of [[Foreskin|prepuce]].
* [[Coronal sulcus]]
* [[Frenulum]]
* Shaft of [[penis]]
* Prepucial orifice
* [[External urethral orifice (male)|Urethral meatus]]
* [[Glans penis]]

===Females===
* [[Labia majora]] is most common site. "Kissing ulcers" may develop. These are ulcers that occur on opposing surfaces of the labia.
* [[Labia minora]]
* [[Frenulum labiorum pudendi|Fourchette]]
* [[Vulval vestibule|Vestibule]]
* [[Clitoris]]
* [[perineum|Perineal]] area
* Inner thighs

==Diagnosis==

===Clinical variants===
Some of clinical variants are as follows.<ref name=cur />
{|class="wikitable sortable sorted"
|-
! Variant!! Characteristics
|-
|Dwarf chancroid|| Small, superficial, relatively painless ulcer.
|-
|Giant chancroid|| Large granulomatous ulcer at the site of a ruptured inguinal bubo, extending beyond its margins.
|-
|Follicular chancroid|| Seen in females in association with hair follicles of the labia majora and [[Mons pubis|pubis]]; initial follicular pustule evolves into a classic ulcer at the site.
|-
|Transient chancroid|| Superficial ulcers that may heal rapidly,followed by a typical inguinal [[bubo]].
|-
|Serpiginous chancroid|| Multiple ulcers that coalesce to form a serpiginous pattern.
|-
|Mixed chancroid|| Nonindurated tender ulcers of chancroid appearing together with an indurated nontender ulcer of syphilis having an incubation period of 10 to 90 days.
|-
|Phagedenic chancroid|| Ulceration that causes extensive destruction of genitalia following secondary or [[superinfection]] by anaerobes such as [[Fusobacterium]] or [[Bacteroides]].
|-
|Chancroidal ulcer|| Most often a [[tenderness (medicine)|tender]], nonindurated, single large ulcer caused by organisms other than ''[[Haemophilus ducreyi]]''; [[lymphadenopathy]] is conspicuous by its absence.
|-

===Laboratory findings===
From bubo pus or ulcer secretions, ''H. ducreyi'' can be identified. PCR-based identification of organisms is available. Simple, rapid, sensitive and inexpensive antigen detection methods for ''H. ducreyi'' identification are also popular. Serologic detection of ''H. ducreyi'' is and uses [[Virulence-related outer membrane protein family|outer membrane protein]] and [[lipooligosaccharide]].

===Differential diagnosis===
{{Quote box

|title = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]'s standard clinical definition for a probable case of chancroid|
|quote =
# Patient has one or more painful genital ulcers. The combination of a painful ulcer with tender [[adenopathy]] is suggestive of chancroid; the presence of suppurative adenopathy is almost pathognomonic.
# No evidence of ''[[Treponema pallidum]]'' infection by [[darkfield microscopy|darkfield microscopic examination]] of ulcer exudate or by a serologic test for syphilis performed greater than or equal to 7 days after onset of ulcers and
# Either a clinical presentation of the ulcer(s) not typical of disease caused by [[herpes simplex virus]] (HSV) or a culture negative for HSV.
}}
Despite many distinguishing features, the clinical spectrums of following diseases may overlap with chancroid:
* [[Primary syphilis]]
* [[Genital herpes]]

=== Comparison with syphilis ===
There are many differences and similarities between the conditions syphilitic [[chancre]] and chancroid.

;Similarities
* Both originate as [[pustule]]s at the site of inoculation, and progress to [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcerated]] lesions
* Both lesions are typically 1–2&nbsp;cm in diameter
* Both lesions are caused by sexually transmissible organisms
* Both lesions typically appear on the genitals of infected individuals
* Both lesions can be present at multiple sites and with multiple lesions

;Differences
* Chancre is a lesion typical of infection with the bacterium that causes [[syphilis]], [[Treponema pallidum]]
* Chancroid is a lesion typical of infection with the bacterium [[Haemophilus ducreyi]]
* Chancres are typically painless, whereas chancroid are typically painful
* Chancres are typically non-exudative, whereas chancroid typically have a grey or yellow purulent [[exudate]]
* Chancres have a hard (indurated) edge, whereas chancroid have a soft edge
* Chancres heal spontaneously within three to six weeks, even in the absence of treatment
* Chancres can occur in the [[pharynx]] as well as on the genitals

==Treatment==
The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] recommendation for chancroid is a single oral dose (1&nbsp;gram) of [[Azithromycin]], or a single IM dose of [[Ceftriaxone]], or oral [[Erythromycin]] for seven days.

Abscesses are drained.

''H. ducreyi'' is [[Antibiotic resistance|resistant]] to [[sulfonamides]], [[tetracyclines]], [[penicillins]], [[chloramphenicol]], [[ciprofloxacin]], [[ofloxacin]], [[trimethoprim]] and [[aminoglycosides]]. Recently, several erythromycin resistant isolates have been reported.<ref name=cur /> 

Treatment failure is possible with HIV co-infection and extended therapy is sometimes required.

==Complications==
* Extensive adenitis may develop.
* Large inguinal [[abscess]]es may develop and rupture to form draining [[Sinus (anatomy)|sinus]] or giant ulcer.
* [[Superinfection]] by ''[[Fusarium]]'' and ''[[Bacteroides]]''. These later require debridement and may result in disfiguring scars.
* [[Phimosis]] can develop in long standing lesion by scarring and thickening of foreskin, which may subsequently require [[circumcision]].

==Prevention==
Chancroid spreads in populations with high sexual activity, such as [[prostitutes]]. Use of condom, prophylaxis by [[azithromycin]], syndromic management of genital ulcers, treating patients with reactive syphilis serology are some of the strategies successfully tried in [[Thailand]].<ref name=cur />

==Prognosis==
Prognosis is excellent with proper treatment. Treating sexual contacts of affected individual helps break cycle of infection.

==History==
Chancroid has been known to humans since time of ancient Greeks.<ref name=std>{{cite book|title=Sexually Transmitted Diseases, 4th ed|year=2007|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=9780071417488|pages=689–698}}</ref> Some of important events on historical timeline of chancre are:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Year !! Event
|-
| 1852|| Leon Bassereau distinguished chancroid from syphilis (i.e. soft chancre from hard chancre)
|-
| 1890s || Augusto Ducrey identified ''H. ducreyi''
|-
| 1900|| Benzacon and colleagues isolated H. ducreyi
|-
| 1970s|| Hammond and colleagues developed selective media
