'''Lacosamide''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], formerly known as '''erlosamide''') is a medication developed by [[UCB (company)|UCB]] for the adjunctive treatment of [[Focal seizures|partial-onset seizure]]s and [[diabetic neuropathy|diabetic neuropathic pain]] marketed under the [[trade name]] '''Vimpat'''.

==Mechanism of action==
Lacosamide is a functionalized amino acid that has activity in the maximal electroshock seizure test, like antiepileptic drugs that are believed to act through [[Voltage_gated_sodium_channel#Voltage-gated|voltage-gated sodium channels]].<ref name="pmid16621450">{{cite journal |author=Rogawski MA |title=Diverse mechanisms of antiepileptic drugs in the development pipeline |journal=Epilepsy Res. |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=273–94 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16621450 |pmc=1562526 |doi=10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2006.02.004}}</ref> However, lacosamide does not act in a conventional way to stabilize fast sodium channel inactivation. Rather, recent studies indicate that it enhances slow inactivation<ref name="pmid17940193">{{cite journal |author=Errington AC, Stöhr T, Heers C, Lees G |title=The investigational anticonvulsant lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels |journal=Molecular Pharmacology |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=157–69 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=17940193 |doi=10.1124/mol.107.039867 |url=}}</ref>
. During an action potential, voltage-gated sodium channels undergo [[Voltage_gated_sodium_channel#Gating|fast inactivation]]. This inactivation prevents the channel from opening, and helps end the action potential. Many antiepileptic drugs, like [[carbamazepine]] or [[lamotrigine]], slow the recovery from inactivation and hence reduce the ability of neurons to fire action potentials. Inactivation only occurs in neurons firing action potentials; this means that drugs that modulate fast inactivation selectively reduce the firing in active cells. Slow inactivation is similar but does not produce complete blockade of voltage gated sodium channels, with both activation and inactivation occurring over hundreds of milliseconds or more. 
Lacosamide makes this inactivation happen at less depolarized [[membrane potential]]s. This means that lacosamide only affects neurons which are depolarized or active for long periods of time, typical of neurons at the focus of an epileptic focus.<ref name="pmid17940193"/>

Lacosamide does not affect [[AMPA receptor|AMPA]], [[Kainate receptor|kainate]], [[NMDA receptor|NMDA]], [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]], [[GABA B receptor|GABA<sub>B</sub>]] or a variety of dopaminergic, serotonergic, adrenergic, muscarinic or cannabinoid receptors and does not block potassium or calcium currents <ref name="pmid16620882">{{cite journal |author=Errington AC, Coyne L, Stöhr T, Selve N, Lees G |title=Seeking a mechanism of action for the novel anticonvulsant lacosamide |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=50 |issue=8 |pages=1016–29 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16620882 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2006.02.002 |url=}}</ref>

==Clinical trials==
In a large [[double-blind]], [[randomized controlled trial|randomized]] [[clinical trial]] of people with poorly controlled partial-onset seizures, lacosamide was found to [[statistical significance|significantly]] reduce seizure frequency when given in addition to other antiepileptics, at doses of 400 and 600&nbsp;milligrams a day.<ref name=Ben-Menachem>{{cite journal |author=Ben-Menachem E, Biton V, Jatuzis D, Abou-Khalil B, Doty P, Rudd GD |title=Efficacy and safety of oral lacosamide as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures |journal=Epilepsia |volume=48 |issue=7 |pages=1308–17 |year=2007 |pmid=17635557 |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2007.01188.x}}</ref> In a smaller trial of people with [[diabetic neuropathy]], lacosamide also provided significantly better [[Pain management|pain relief]] when compared to [[placebo]].<ref name=Rauck>{{cite journal |author=Rauck RL, Shaibani A, Biton V, Simpson J, Koch B |title=Lacosamide in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a phase 2 double-blind placebo-controlled study |journal=Clin J Pain |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=150–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17237664 |doi=10.1097/01.ajp.0000210957.39621.b2}}</ref>

==Tolerability==
Lacosamide was generally well tolerated in adult patients with partial-onset seizures. Dizziness was the most common treatment-related adverse event.<ref name="lacosa">Cross SA, Curran MP.[http://adisonline.com/drugs/abstract/2009/69040/Lacosamide__In_Partial_Onset_Seizures.5.aspx].Drugs 2009;69(4):449-459. {{doi|10.2165/00003495-200969040-00005}}.</ref>
