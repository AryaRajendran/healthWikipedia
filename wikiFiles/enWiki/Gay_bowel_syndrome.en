'''Gay bowel syndrome''' is a medical term first used by Henry L Kazal and colleagues in 1976 to describe the various sexually transmitted perianal and [[rectal diseases]] and sexual traumas seen in Kazal's [[proctology]] practice, which had many [[gay]] patients.

==History==

After Kazal, the term was used sporadically in medical literature from the 1970s to refer to a complex of [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] symptoms affecting [[men who have sex with men|gay men]]. The term was first used in the [[HIV|pre-HIV]] era, by Kazal et al. in 1976.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kazal HL, Sohn N, Carrasco JI, Robilotti JG, Delaney WE |title=The gay bowel syndrome: clinico-pathologic correlation in 260 cases |journal=Ann.

Reported causes include [[hepatitis virus]]es, [[syphilis]], [[gonorrhea]], [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[campylobacter]], and [[shigellosis]], as well as a variety of [[protozoal infection]]s.<ref name="Borchardt1997"/> The concept of "gay bowel syndrome" was later expanded to include various opportunistic [[cancer]]s.  Transmission of disease was considered to take place by two routes: [[anal sex]], and fecal-oral route ([[anal–oral sex]] or [[coprophagia]]). Sometimes, difficulty in specifying the method may be a result of transmission by both methods.<ref name="Borchardt1997"/> Following the onset of the [[AIDS epidemic]], the reported incidence of these complaints has declined, likely as a result of [[safe sex|changing sexual practices]].<ref>{{cite web|last= Bartlett|first=John|date=March 15, 2004|title=New Look at "Gay Bowel Syndrome",  Etiology of Clinical Proctitis Among Men Who Have Sex With Men.  |publisher = [[Medscape]]| url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/470936_4}}</ref>

== Obsolescence ==
The term "gay bowel syndrome" is considered obsolete and derogatory. The ''McGraw-Hill Manual of Colorectal Surgery'' says:
{{quote|Coined in the pre-HIV era, the term "gay bowel syndrome" comprised a rather unselective [[potpourri]] of unusual anorectal and GI symptoms experienced by homosexual males... with better understanding of the underlying causes, this term is outdated: the derogatory terminology should be abandoned and more specific entities and terms recognized and used.<ref name="mgh-handbook">{{cite book|last=Kaiser|first=Andreas|title=McGraw-Hill Manual of Colorectal Surgery|year=2008|pages=205|isbn=0-07-159070-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=bnjWQZAxOZ0C&pg=PA205&dq}}</ref>}}

A 1997 article in the ''[[Journal of Homosexuality]]'' concluded:
{{quote|It is apparent that Gay Bowel Syndrome is an essentialized category of difference that is neither gay-specific, confined to the bowel, nor a syndrome. The use and diagnosis of Gay Bowel Syndrome must be abandoned.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Scarce M |title=Harbinger of plague: a bad case of gay bowel syndrome |journal=J Homosex. |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=1&ndash;35 |year=1997|pmid=9328857 |doi= |url=}}</ref>}}

The term "gay bowel syndrome" was withdrawn as "outdated" by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterologists in 2004,<ref>{{cite web | work = Gmax.co.za | first = Jon | last = Garbo | date = December 21, 2004 | accessdate = June 24, 2009 | title = "Gay Bowel Syndrome" struck from textbook | url = http://www.gmax.co.za/think/health/2004/041221-gbs.html}}</ref> and the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control]] described the term as informal and no longer in use in 2005.<ref>{{cite news | title = Activist fights 'outdated' medical phrase: Effort to debunk 'gay bowel syndrome' may face new challenge | work = [[Washington Blade]] | first = Ryan | last = Lee | date = April 8, 2005 | accessdate = June 24, 2009 | url = http://www.aegis.org/news/wb/2005/WB050411.html}}</ref> The [[LGBT social movements|gay activist]] and author [[Michael Scarce]] criticized the concept of "gay bowel syndrome" in his book ''Smearing the Queer: Medical Bias in the Health Care of Gay Men'' (1999), saying that "gay bowel syndrome has been, and remains today, a powerful tool for the specific surveillance, regulation, definition, medicalization, identification, and fragmentation of gay men's bodies."<ref>{{cite book | title = Smearing the Queer: Medical Bias in the Health Care of Gay Men | first = Michael | last = Scarce |authorlink = Michael Scarce | publisher = Routledge | page = 13 | isbn = 1-56023-926-3 | year = 1999 }}</ref> Scarce's work has been cited in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' with a positive review.<ref>''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' (2000). pp. 284</ref> The term does however remain in use in the fifth edition of the Australian textbook "John Murtagh's General Practice", considered the "bible" of General Practice/Family Medicine in that country - page 459.
