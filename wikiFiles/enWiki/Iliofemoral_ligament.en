The '''iliofemoral ligament''' is a [[ligament]] of the [[hip joint]] which extends from the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] to the [[femur]] in front of the joint.  It is also referred to as the '''Y-ligament''' (see below) or the '''ligament of [[Henry Jacob Bigelow|Bigelow]]''', and any combinations of these names.

With a tensile strength exceeding 350&nbsp;kg (772&nbsp;lbs),<ref name="Platzer-198">Platzer (2004), p 198</ref> the iliofemoral ligament is not only stronger than the two other ligaments of the hip joint, the [[ischiofemoral ligament|ischiofemoral]] and the [[pubofemoral ligament|pubofemoral]], but also the strongest ligament in the human body and as such is an important constraint to the hip joint.<ref name="Thieme-Atlas-380">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 380</ref>

==Structure==
Arising from the [[anterior inferior iliac spine]] and the rim of the [[acetabulum]], the iliofemoral ligament spreads obliquely downwards and lateralwards to the [[intertrochanteric line]] on the anterior side of the [[femur head|femoral head]].  It is divided into two parts or bands which act differently: the transverse part above, is strong and runs parallel to the axis of the [[femur neck|femoral neck]]. The descending part below, is weaker and runs parallel to the [[Body of femur|femoral shaft]].  As the lateral portion is twisted like a screw, the two parts together take the form of an inverted Y.<ref name="Platzer-200">Platzer (2004), p 200</ref>

It is intimately connected with the [[joint capsule]], and serves to strengthen the joint by resisting [[hyperextension]].  Its upper band is sometimes named the '''iliotrochanteric ligament'''.  Between the two bands is a thinner part of the capsule.  In some cases there is no division, and the ligament spreads out into a flat triangular band which is attached to the whole length of the intertrochanteric line.

==Function==
In a standing posture, when the [[pelvis]] is tilted posteriorly, the ligament is twisted and tense, which prevents the trunk from falling backwards and the posture is maintained without the need for muscular activity.  In this position the ligament also keeps the [[femur head|femoral head]] pressed into the acetabulum.<ref name="Platzer-200" />

As the thighs flexes, the tension in the ligament is reduced and the amount of possible rotations in the hip joint is increased, which permits the pelvis to tilt backwards into its sitting angle.  Lateral rotation and adduction in the hip joint is controlled by the strong transversal part, while the descending part limits medial rotation.<ref name="Platzer-200" />

[[turnout (ballet)|Turnout]] used in the classical [[ballet]] style requires a great deal of flexibility in this ligament. As does the [[front split]] where the rear leg is hyper-extended at the hip. Many externally rotate the rear leg while doing a front split, this external rotation when the hip is not flexed stretches the ligament even more. This "martial arts split" is distinguished by the rear knee pointing outward sideways (usually the foot along with it) rather than pointing straight down with the patella facing the floor, in a pure extension front split.
