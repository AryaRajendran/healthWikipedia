'''Pre-medical''' (often referred to as '''pre-med''') is an educational track that [[undergraduate]] students in the United States pursue prior to becoming medical students. It involves activities that prepare a student for [[Medical school in the United States|medical school]], such as pre-med coursework, volunteer activities, clinical experience, research, and the application process.

==Major==
At most colleges and universities, students do not have the option of pre-medical [[Academic major|major]]. A student on a pre-med track is permitted to choose any undergraduate major in any field of study, so long as certain required courses are completed. Such courses are generally focused in the scientific fields of [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], and [[physics]], which are necessary for an individual to be prepared for the [[Medical College Admission Test|Medical College Admission Test (MCAT)]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.aamc.org/students/applying/mcat/preparing/ | title=Preparing for the MCAT Exam | publisher=AMCAS | accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref> and satisfy most medical school prerequisites.<ref name=AAMCReq /> It is for this reason students on a pre-med track generally undertake a major associated with one of those fields; however, an increasing number of students with a background in humanities have been applying in recent years,<ref name="AAMC2010MajorData">{{cite web | url=https://www.aamc.org/download/161692/data/table18-facts2010mcatgpabymaj1-web.pdf.pdf | title=MCAT and GPAs for Applicants and Matriculants to U.S. Medical Schools by Primary Undergraduate Major, 2010 | publisher=AAMC | accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref> a situation applauded by medical schools.<ref name="newsweek">{{Citation | last=Kliff | first=Sarah | url=http://saveksuhistory.wordpress.com/2007/09/06/newsweek-med-schools-seek-more-nonscience-students/ | title=Med Schools Seek More Nonscience Students | newspaper=[[Newsweek]] | date=10 September 2007}}</ref> For example, [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] has created a program specifically for non-science majors.

==Pre-med timeline==
Typical pre-med students will structure their coursework in their first year in [[university]] to accommodate the required courses. After a semester, many pursue extracurricular activities that demonstrate a commitment to medicine. Once junior year arrives, students register for and take the [[Medical College Admission Test|MCAT]], the required standardized exam that medical schools use to identify qualified candidates.<ref name="newsweek">{{cite news | last=Kliff | first=Sarah | url=http://saveksuhistory.wordpress.com/2007/09/06/newsweek-med-schools-seek-more-nonscience-students/ | title=Med Schools Seek More Nonscience Students | newspaper=[[Newsweek]] | date=10 September 2007}}</ref> Once the test is taken, students apply to various schools using the automated [[American Medical College Application Service|AMCAS]] system, AACOMAS system, or in some cases, the school's own application system. AMCAS primary applications are verified by AMCAS staff, a process that often takes four to six weeks.<ref name="newsweek">{{cite news | last=Kliff | first=Sarah | url=http://saveksuhistory.wordpress.com/2007/09/06/newsweek-med-schools-seek-more-nonscience-students/ | title=Med Schools Seek More Nonscience Students | newspaper=[[Newsweek]] | date=10 September 2007}}</ref> The application process consists of a review of academic records, MCAT scores, activities, work experience, and a personal statement.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hms.harvard.edu/admissions/default.asp?page=selection | title=Selection Factors | publisher=Harvard Medical School | accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref> Applicants can expect to hear from schools within a few months, at which point they may receive "secondary applications".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://prehealthadvising.com/2010/11/2011-2012-medical-school-application-timeline/ | title=2011-2012 Medical School Application Timeline | publisher=prehealthadvising.com | accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref> Different schools have different policies on sending secondary applications to students; many send secondary applications to all students, others screen applications prior to inviting an applicant to submit a secondary application. These applications are generated by each individual school. They generally contain essay questions that the applicant must answer to demonstrate that the applicant possesses qualities that the schools deem necessary to be a good medical student and physician.<ref name=PRMSA>{{cite web | url=http://www.princetonreview.com/medical/medical-school-applications.aspx | title=Medical School Applications | publisher=The Princeton Review | accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref> Qualified applicants can next expect to receive invitations to interview at schools. Upon completion of an interview and receipt of any additional application materials, the application is considered to be complete, and the student then waits for the school's decision to either accept or reject the student.<ref name=PRMSA />

Increasingly, more non-traditional applicants are pursuing admittance to medical school through a "post-baccalaureate" pre-medical program.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} These programs may be formal, such as the programs offered through [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]], [[Mayo Clinic]] with Barrett, The Honors College, [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]], [[Goucher]] and [[Scripps College|Scripps]], or semi-formal, such as the program offered at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], but often consist of a student informally enrolling in a college to complete science coursework required for admission to medical school prior to sitting for the MCAT. The [[Association of American Medical Colleges|AAMC]] maintains a list of all formal and semi-formal post-baccalaureate pre-medical programs in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://services.aamc.org/postbac/ | title=Postbaccalaureate Premedical Programs - Search | publisher=AAMC | accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref>

==Coursework==
The [[Association of American Medical Colleges]] has created a list of required courses that every pre-med student must take.<ref name=AAMCReq /> Each school is allowed to place its own further requirements.

The pre-medical coursework is offered at many American colleges and [[universities]]; however, it is considered to be a "track" that follows a certain curriculum. Most pre-medical students major in the natural sciences, such as [[biology]], [[chemistry]], or [[physics]], though this is not a requirement.

The courses that must be taken to meet the pre-medical requirements as set forth by the [[Association of American Medical Colleges|AAMC]] are two years of [[chemistry]], with one being in [[organic chemistry]], one year of [[biology]], and one year of [[physics]].<ref name=AAMCReq>{{cite web | url=https://www.aamc.org/students/applying/requirements/ | title=Admission Requirements | publisher=AAMC | accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref> These course requirements are expected to change since the MR5 Committee, charged with revising the [[Medical College Admissions Test]] has created a new set of core competencies for success in medical education and practice.  Those core competencies will include a greater emphasis on molecular genetics within the biology curriculum and will include biochemistry.  In addition, the 2015 MCAT will test in areas related to multicultural sensitivity and in critical analysis of ethics and philosophy.<ref name=newAAMCReq>{{cite web | url=https://www.aamc.org/students/download/266006/data/2015previewguide.pdf | title=2015 MCAT preview | publisher=AAMC | accessdate=March 24, 2012}}</ref><ref name="New York Times">{{cite web | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/education/edlife/pre-meds-new-priorities-heart-and-soul-and-social-science.html?_r=3&ref=elisabethrosenthal | title=Pre-Medâ€™s New Priorities: Heart and Soul and Social Science, NYT, April 13, 2012 | accessdate=April 24, 2012}}</ref> Many colleges of medicine and undergraduate pre-medical advising offices have yet to formalize pre-medical curricular recommendations.  Though it did not address changes in the mathematics, physics, psychosocial or humanities portion of pre-medical education, the [[American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology]] (ASBMB) developed a set of pre-medical curricular recommendations.  ASBMB advocated that the year of biology includes genetics; that general and organic chemistry be taught with an orientation toward the chemistry of molecules encountered in living things; that one semester of biochemistry be required and two semester of biochemistry be recommended; and that the laboratory course requirement can be taught in biology, chemistry or biochemistry, so long as research methods and data analysis are emphasized.<ref name=ASBMBcurriculum>{{cite web | url=http://www.asbmb.org/asbmbtoday/asbmbtoday_article.aspx?id=16052| title=ASBMB pre-medical curriculum | publisher=ASBMB | accessdate=March 24, 2012}}</ref>

Pre-medical students may be advised or required to take upper level [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] electives, such as [[cellular biology]], [[physical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]]. Specific requirements for these courses vary by institution. Schools may also have requirements for non-science classes. Some require a certain number of general [[humanities]] credits, while others have specific requirements for courses in [[English studies|English]], [[Psychology]], or other disciplines.

==Other countries==
In [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]], a number of universities offer a three or four year [[Bachelor of Medical Science]], [[Bachelor of Health Sciences]] or [[Bachelor of Biomedical Science|Biomedical Science]] degree, which is similar in content and aim to pre-med courses in the US.  However, it is also possible to gain entry to a professional degree program in medicine (usually the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degree) directly from college/sixth form if the applicant achieves high grades upon graduation and is successful in the Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test ([[UMAT]]), for Australian and New Zealand medicine courses, and the UK Clinical Aptitude Test ([[UKCAT]]) /  BioMedical Admissions Test ([[BMAT]]) for British medicine courses.
