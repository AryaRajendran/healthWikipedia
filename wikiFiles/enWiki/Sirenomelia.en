'''Sirenomelia''', alternatively known as '''Mermaid Syndrome''', is a very rare [[congenital deformity]] in which the legs are fused together, giving them the appearance of a [[mermaid]]'s tail.

This condition is found in approximately one out of every 100,000 live births<ref name="Kallen">{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jmg.29.1.30 |title=The cyclops and the mermaid: An epidemiological study of two types of rare malformation |year=1992 |last1=Kallen |first1=B |last2=Castilla |first2=E E |last3=Lancaster |first3=P A |last4=Mutchinick |first4=O |last5=Knudsen |first5=L B |last6=Martinez-Frias |first6=M L |last7=Mastroiacovo |first7=P |last8=Robert |first8=E |journal=Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=29 |pages=30–5 |pmid=1552541 |issue=1 |pmc=1015818}}</ref> (about as rare as [[conjoined twins]]) and is usually fatal within a day or two of birth because of complications associated with abnormal [[kidney]] and [[urinary bladder]] development and function.

VACTERL-H is an expanded form of the [[VACTERL association]] that concludes that this diagnosis is a less severe form of sirenomelia.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1055/s-2007-993925 |title=Prenatal Diagnosis of Sirenomelia with Bilateral Hydrocephalus: Report of a Previously Undocumented form of VACTERL-H Association |year=2008 |last1=Onyeije |first1=Chukwuma |last2=Sherer |first2=David |last3=Handwerker |first3=Sara |last4=Shah |first4=Leena |journal=American Journal of Perinatology |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=193–7 |pmid=9572377}}</ref> The disorder was formerly thought to be an extreme case of [[caudal regression syndrome]]; however, it was reclassified to be considered a separate condition.

==Notable cases==
Only a handful of patients who did not have the usual kidney and bladder complications have survived beyond birth with this condition, 3 of them being:

=== Milagros Cerrón ===
{{Infobox person
| name                 = Milagros Cerrón Arauco
| birth_date           = {{birth-date and age|April 27, 2004}}
| birth_place          = [[Huancayo]], [[Peru]]
}}
Milagros Cerrón Arauco was born on April 27, 2004, in [[Huancayo]], [[Peru]]. Although most of Milagros’ internal organs, including her heart and lungs, are in perfect condition, she was born with serious internal defects, including a deformed left [[kidney]] and a very small right one located very low in her body. In addition, her [[gastrointestinal tract|digestive]], [[urinary system|urinary tract]]s and [[sex organ|genitals]] share a single tube.
This birth defect occurs during the gastrulation week (week 3) of embryological development. Gastrulation establishes the three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. It seems that complications such as defects in the urogenital system as mentioned above can be possibly due to malformations in the intermediate mesoderm.

A four-hour operation to insert silicone bags between her legs to stretch the skin was successfully completed on February 8, 2005. A successful operation to separate her legs to just above the knee took place May 31, 2005, in a "Solidarity Hospital" in the district of [[Surquillo]] in [[Lima]]. The procedure, however, was so intensive that she became [[Psychological trauma|traumatized]] to the degree of losing her ability to form proper speech patterns, leaving her nearly [[speech disorder|mute]]. It is not yet known if this is a [[physiological]] or [[psychological]] condition. However, at Milagros' second birthday, her mother reported that she knew more than 50 words. A second operation to complete the separation up to the groin took place on September 7, 2006.<ref>BBC News 24, September 7, 2006,''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5325082.stm "Mermaid" girl's legs separated]'' </ref> A few weeks later, she took her first steps.<ref>Daily Mail September 27, 2006, ''[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-407134/Mermaid-girl-takes-unaided-steps.html "Mermaid" girl takes her first unaided steps]'' </ref>

Her doctor Luis Rubio said he was pleased with the progress Milagros had made, but cautioned that she still needed 10 to 15 years of rehabilitation and more operations before she could lead a normal life. Particularly, she will require reconstructive surgery to rebuild her rudimentary [[anus]], [[urethra]] and genitalia.

Milagros' parents are from a poor village in Peru's [[Andes|Andes Mountains]]; the Solidarity Hospital has given a job to her father Ricardo Cerrón so that the family can remain in [[Lima]], while the City of Lima has pledged to pay for many of the operations.<ref>BBC News September 28, 2006, ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5381616.stm "Mermaid" girl takes first steps]'' </ref>

Shiloh Jade Pepin (August 4, 1999 – October 23, 2009) was born in [[Kennebunkport, Maine]], [[United States]] on August 4, 1999, with her lower extremities fused, no bladder, no [[uterus]], no rectum, only 6&nbsp;inches of large [[colon (anatomy)|colon]], no [[vagina]], and with only one quarter of a [[kidney]] and one [[ovary]]. Her parents initially anticipated she could expect only a few months of life. Her natural kidney failed when she was just 3 months old. After that she was on [[dialysis]].<ref>TV program ''Body Shock'', 10–11 pm, 18 May 2010, [[Channel 4]]</ref> A [[kidney transplantation|kidney transplant]] at age 2 lasted a number of years, and in 2007 a second kidney transplant was successful.
