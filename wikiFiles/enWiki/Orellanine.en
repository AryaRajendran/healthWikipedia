'''Orellanine''' or '''Orellanin''' is a [[mycotoxin]] found in some mushrooms of the [[Cortinariaceae]] family.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Journal of Chromatography| year=1997 |title=Novel methods for identification and quantification of the mushroom nephrotoxin orellanine | author = Oubrahim H.; Richard J.-M.; Cantin-Esnault D.; Seigle-Murandi F.; Trecourt F |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2591101 |volume=758 |issue =1 |pages=145–157| doi=10.1016/S0021-9673(96)00695-4| pmid=9181972}}</ref> Structurally, it is a [[pyridine N-oxide]].

==History==
In Poland during the 1950s there was a small epidemic where over 100 people became ill. What caused the illness remained a mystery until 1952 when Polish physician Dr. Stanisław Grzymala<ref>See:

In 1962 he isolated a substance from the fungus. He named it orellanine after the [[Latin]] name of the [[toadstool]]. Given orally to research animals, he produced the same reaction as in humans.<ref>[http://folk.uio.no/klaush/cort_rub.htm Slørsoppene omfatter noen av våre farligste giftsopper] [Veiled mushrooms include some of our most dangerous toxic mushrooms] (Article in Norwegian)</ref>

In 1973 orellanine was discovered in the toadstool ''[[Cortinarius rubellus]]''.

==Chemistry==
The chemical constitution of orellanine remained unknown until the Polish [[chemist]]s Antkowiak and Gessner in the last half of the 1970s discovered that it was a [[bipyridine]] [[amine oxide|dioxide]].<ref>Antkowiak, W.Z. and Gessner, W. P. (1975) "Isolation and characteristics of toxic components of ''Cortinarius orellanus'', Fries.," ''Bulletin de l'Academie Polonaise des Sciences, Serie des Sciences Chemiques'', vol. 23, pages 729-733.</ref><ref>
Wieław Z. Antkowiak and Wiesł P. Gessner (1979) "The structures of orellanine and orelline," ''Tetrahedron Letters'', vol. 20, no. 21, pages 1931-1934.</ref> The more stable [[tautomer]] is the [[amine oxide]] form.

An interesting feature of orellanine is its ability to bind [[aluminium]] ions to organic complexes.<ref>Høiland, K. (1994) "Suppression of the toxic effect of soluble aluminium on fungi by dermocybin-1-ß-D-glucopyranoside and orellanine from ''Cortinarius sanguineus'' and ''C. orellanoides''." ''Nord. J. Bot.'' 14: 221-228.</ref>

==Toxicity==
Bipyridines with positively charged nitrogen atoms were already known to be [[poisonous]] before the structure of orellanine was elucidated. The [[herbicides]] [[paraquat]] and [[diquat]] are toxic not only to plants, but also to animals including humans. Bipyridines with charged nitrogen atoms confound important [[redox]] reactions in [[organisms]], ‘stealing’ one or two [[electrons]] and sometimes bypass the electrons into other and often undesirable redox reactions. The terminal product can be [[peroxide]] or [[superoxide]] [[ions]], the latter of which is harmful to the cells. It is likely that orellanine works in the same way, although the process from disturbed redox reactions to the serious clinical kidney damage has not been properly resolved.

In humans, a characteristic of poisoning by the [[nephrotoxin]] orellanine is the long latency; the first symptoms usually do not appear until 2–3 days after ingestion and can in some cases take as long as 3 weeks. The first symptoms of orellanine poisoning are similar to the common [[Influenza|flu]] ([[nausea]], vomiting, stomach pains, [[headaches]], [[myalgia]], etc.), these symptoms are followed by early stages of [[renal failure]] (immense thirst, frequent urination, pain on and around the [[kidneys]]) and eventually decreased or nonexistent urine output and other symptoms of renal failure occur. If left untreated death will follow.

The {{LD50}} of orellanine in mice is 12 to 20&nbsp;mg per kg body weight;<ref>{{cite journal

}}{{Dead link|date=January 2013}}</ref> this is the dose which leads to death within two weeks. From cases of orellanine-related [[mushroom poisoning]] in humans it seems that the lethal dose for humans is considerably lower.

==Treatment==
Although there is no known [[antidote]] against orellanine poisoning, early hospitalization can sometimes prevent serious injury and usually prevent death. Research is ongoing. Some treatments make use of anti-oxidant therapy and [[corticosteroids]] to help victims recover from their renal failure.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Rachael G.
