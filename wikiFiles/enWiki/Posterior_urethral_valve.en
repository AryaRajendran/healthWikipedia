'''Posterior urethral valve''' (PUV) disorder is an obstructive developmental anomaly in the [[urethra]] and [[genitourinary system]] of male newborns.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Manzoni C, Valentini A | title = Posterior urethral valves. | journal = Rays | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–4 | year = 2002| pmid = 12696266}}</ref> A posterior urethral valve is an obstructing membrane in the posterior male urethra as a result of abnormal ''[[in utero]]'' development. It is the most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns. The disorder varies in degree, with mild cases followed conservatively. More severe cases can have [[renal failure|renal]] and [[respiratory failure]] from [[pulmonary hypoplasia|lung underdevelopment]] as result of [[oligohydramnios|low amniotic fluid volumes]], requiring [[intensive care unit|intensive care]] and close monitoring.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/412226-overview|title = Emedicine - Posterior urethral valves - overview and treatment.|accessdate = July 26, 2010|publisher = Emedicine}}</ref> Incidence is one in 8000 babies.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site1471/mainpageS1471P0.html|title = Posterior urethral valves - Disease Information.|accessdate = January 31, 2011|publisher = Children's hospital, Boston}}</ref>

==Classification==
[[Image:Gray1142.png|thumb|right|The male urethra laid open on its anterior (upper) surface. Posterior valves are usually fusion of the ''plicae colliculi'' between the entrance of the seminal vesicles at the veromontanum, and extend to the membranous urethra.]] Posterior urethral obstruction was first classified by H. H. Young in 1919.  The ''[[verumontanum]]'', or mountain ridge, is a distinctive landmark in the [[prostate|prostatic]] urethra, important in the systemic division of posterior valve disorders:

* Type I - Most common type; due to anterior fusing of the ''plicae colliculi'', mucosal fins extending from the bottom of the verumontanum distally along the prostatic and membranous urethra<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nationwidechildrens.org/gd/applications/radiology/atlas/Urethra%20Atlas/Plicae%20colliculi.html|title = Nationwide Children's Hospital, Radiology - Posterior urethral valves|accessdate = July 26, 2010|publisher = Nationwide Children's Hospital}}</ref>
* Type II - Least common variant; vertical or longitudinal folds between the verumontanum and proximal prostatic urethra and bladder neck
* Type III - Less common variant; a disc of tissue distal to verumontanum, also theorized  to be a developmental anomaly of congenital urogenital remnants in the bulbar urethra

Researchers have suggested that obstructions in the posterior urethra are more appropriately termed congenital obstructions of the posterior urethral membrane (COPUMs). The congenital urothelial remnants of type III posterior urethral valves have been [[eponymous]]ly referred to as Cobb's collar or Moorman's ring.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nationwidechildrens.org/gd/applications/radiology/atlas/Urethra%20Atlas/Plicae%20colliculi.html|title = Nationwide Children's Hospital, Radiology - Cobb's Collar|accessdate = July 26, 2010|publisher = Nationwide Children's Hospital}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Urethralklappe.jpg|thumb|Postvesicular obstruction due to urethral valves.]]
Abdominal [[ultrasound]] is of some benefit, but not diagnostic.  Features that suggest posterior urethral valves are bilateral hydronephrosis, a thickened bladder wall with thickened [[smooth muscle]] trabeculations, and bladder [[diverticula]]. 

[[Voiding cystourethrogram]] (VCUG) is more specific for the diagnosis. Normal ''plicae circularis'' are variable in appearance and often not seen on normal VCUGs.  PUV on voiding cystourethrogram is characterized by an abrupt tapering of urethral caliber near the [[seminal colliculus|verumontanum]], with the specific level depending on the developmental variant. [[Vesicoureteral reflux]] is also seen in over 50% of cases.  

Diagnosis can also be made by [[cystoscopy]], where a small camera is inserted into the urethra for direct visualization of the posteriorly positioned valve. A limitation of this technique is that posterior valve tissue is translucent and can be pushed against the wall of the [[urethra]] by inflowing irrigation fluid, making it difficult to visualize. 

Centers in Europe and Japan have also had excellent results with cystosonography, although it has not been approved for use in the United States yet.<ref name="emedicine">{{cite web|url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/412226|title =Emedicine - Posterior Urethral Valves - Diagnosis and Treatment|accessdate = July 18, 2010|publisher = [[Emedicine]]}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment is by endoscopic valve ablation. Fetal surgery is a high risk procedure reserved for cases with severe [[oligohydramnios]], to try to limit the associated lung underdevelopment, or [[pulmonary hypoplasia]], that is seen at birth in these patients. The risks of fetal surgery are significant and include limb entrapment, abdominal injury, and fetal or maternal death. Specific procedures for ''in utero'' intervention include infusions of [[amniotic fluid]], serial bladder aspiration, and creating a connection between the amniotic sac and the fetal bladder, or vesicoamniotic shunt.<ref name="emedicine"/>

There are three specific endoscopic treatments of posterior urethral valves:
*Vesicostomy followed by valve ablation - a [[stoma]], or hole, is made in the [[urinary bladder]], also known as ''high diversion'', after which the valve is ablated and the stoma is closed.
*Pyelostomy followed by valve ablation -  stoma is made in the pelvis of the kidney as a slightly lower ''high diversion'', after which the valve is ablated and the stoma is closed
*Primary (transurethral) valve ablation - the valve is removed through the urethra without creation of a stoma

The standard treatment is primary (transurethral) ablation of the valves.<ref name=warren>Warren J, Pike JG, Leonard MP. Posterior urethral valves in Eastern Ontario - a 30 year perspective.

The long-term outcome of posterior urethral valves treated with primary valve ablation and observation. J Urol. 1996 May;155(5):1730-4. PMID 8627873.</ref> 

Following surgery, the follow-up in patients with posterior urethral valve syndrome is long term, and often requires a multidisciplinary effort between [[urologists]], [[pulmonologists]], [[neonatology|neonatologists]], [[radiologists]] and the family of the patient. Care must be taken to  promote proper bladder compliance and renal function, as well as to monitor and treat the significant lung underdevelopment that can accompany the disorder.
