A '''relapse''' or '''recidivism''' is a recurrence of a past (typically medical) condition. For example, MS or malaria often exhibit peaks of activity and sometimes long periods of dormancy.

'''Relapse''', in relation to [[drug misuse]], is resuming the use of a [[drug]] or a [[chemical substance]] after one or more periods of [[abstinence]]. The term is a landmark feature of both  [[substance dependence]] and [[substance abuse]], which are [[learned behaviors]], and is maintained by [[neuronal]] [[adaptations]] that mediate learning and processing of various motivational [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]].<ref name="  kadden">{{cite web | url = http://www.bhrm.org/guidelines/CBT-Kadden.pdf | title = Cognitive-Behavior Therapy for Substance Dependence: Coping Skills Training | author = Kadden RM  | date = 2002-09-10 | format = pdf | work = | publisher = Behavioral Health Recovery Management, University of Chicago | accessdate = 2011-12-03 }}</ref><ref name= vanden/> An important aspect of drug use is the propensity for repeated use and dependence, tendencies that are influenced by the nature of the drug itself and thus vary from substance to substance.

==Causes==   
Substances that may cause dependence or abuse can be classified based on their given effects on the [[brain]] and [[nervous system]].

**[[Amphetamines]]
**[[Methamphetamines]]
**[[Caffeine]]
*''' [[Depressants]] ''' slow down [[neuronal]] activity.

***[[Alcohol]] produces [[disinhibition]] in the nervous system when introduced, and it depresses the [[frontal cortex]] while speeding up the rest of the brain.  This can lead to decreased ability to perceive and evaluate [[risk|risks]] and make good decisions, and other characteristics of what is commonly known as [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxication]].

===DEA schedules of controlled substances===
The [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) has categorized [[controlled substances]] into 5 major categories based on the drug’s [[substance dependence#Addictive potential|addictive potential]] and intended use.  Drugs with the highest addictive potential are listed in [[List of Schedule I drugs (US)|DEA Schedules I]] and [[List of Schedule II drugs (US)|II]].  Schedule I drugs are those with no accepted medical or therapeutic use whereas Schedule II drugs are those that can be used therapeutically but may lead to severe [[physical dependence|physical]] or [[psychological dependence]].<ref>Section 812. Schedules of Controlled Substances. (2007). Retrieved November 21, 2011from http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/812.htm</ref>

===Addictive potential===
:''Related article: [[Substance dependence]]
The addictive potential, also sometimes called [[substance abuse#Drug misuse|abuse potential]], varies greatly between substances and is based on both the pleasurable effects associated with the drug and the likelihood that the drug will induce dependent behavior.  The system for quantifying addictive potential based on scientific knowledge was first established by Professor [[David Nutt]] in 2007. The addictive potential for the 14 substances examined in this study was derived by scoring the drugs on a four-point scale in 9 different [[parameters]].  The parameters were established by dividing the three categories of harm into 3 further subgroups.

====Categories of harm====
The three main categories to determine addictive potential are the physical harm of the drug to the user, the drug’s tendency to cause dependence, and effects of the drug on [[society]].

=====Physical harm=====
The first category can be further divided into three parameters of harm: [[acute (medicine)|acute]] physical harm, [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] physical harm, and [[intravenous]] harm.  Acute harm is defined as the immediate effects associated with use of the given drug such as [[respiratory depression]] or [[myocardial infarction]].  Chronic harm is the consequence of continued and repeated use such as [[psychosis]] or [[lung disease]].  Lastly, intravenous harm refers to problems associated with the route of administration such as the spread of [[blood-borne pathogens]] like [[HIV]].<ref name= nutt/>

=====Dependence=====
The second parameter of harm is subdivided into three smaller categories: the pleasurable effects of the drug, the induced physical dependence, and the induced psychological dependence.  The intensity of pleasure experienced is influenced by the initial rapid effect, called the [[rush (psychology)|rush]], and the subsequent lasting euphoria, called the [[Substance intoxication|high]].<ref name= nutt/>

=====Social harm=====
This category is subdivided into the last three parameters: [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], other social harms, and [[healthcare]] costs.  These parameters attempt to rate a drug’s impact on [[families]], [[communities]], and [[societies]].<ref name= nutt/>

The availability of the [[Dopamine receptor D2]] plays a role in [[self-administration]] and the [[reinforcement|reinforcing effects]] of [[cocaine]] and other [[stimulants]].  The D2 receptor availability has an [[inverse relationship]] to vulnerability to the reinforcing effects of the [[drug]].  That is, as D2 receptors become limited the user becomes more susceptible to the reinforcing effects of cocaine.  It is currently unknown if a [[Genetic predisposition|predisposition]] to low D2 receptor availability is possible; however, most studies support the idea that changes in D2 receptor availability are a [[result]], rather than a [[wikt:Special:Search/precursor|precursor]], of cocaine use.  It has also been noted that D2 receptors may return to the level existing prior to drug exposure during long periods of [[abstinence]], a fact which may have implications in relapse [[#Treatment|treatment]].<ref name= czoty2005>{{cite journal | author = Czoty PW, Gage HD, Nader MA | title = PET imaging of striatal dopamine D2 receptors in nonhuman primates: increases in availability produced by chronic raclopride treatment | journal = Synapse | volume = 58 | issue = 4 | pages = 215–9 | year = 2005 | month = December | pmid = 16206180 | doi = 10.1002/syn.20200 }}</ref>

===Social hierarchy===
[[Social interaction]]s, such as the formation of [[Social Dominance Theory#Group hierarchy|linear dominance hierarchies]], also play a role in vulnerability to drug abuse.  [[Animal studies]] suggest that there exists a difference in D2 receptor availability between [[Dominance hierarchy|dominant]] and subordinate animals within a [[social hierarchy]] as well as a difference in the function of cocaine to [[reinforce]] self-administration in these animal groups.  Socially dominant animals exhibit higher availability of D2 receptors and fail to maintain self-administration.<ref name = czoty2004>{{cite journal | author = Czoty PW, Morgan D, Shannon EE, Gage HD, Nader MA | title = Characterization of dopamine D1 and D2 receptor function in socially housed cynomolgus monkeys self-administering cocaine | journal = Psychopharmacology (Berl.) | volume = 174 | issue = 3 | pages = 381–8 | year = 2004 | month = July | pmid = 14767632 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-003-1752-z }}</ref>

==Triggers==
Drug taking and relapse are heavily influenced by a number of factors including the [[pharmacokinetics]], [[dose (biochemistry)|dose]], and [[neurochemistry]] of the drug itself, as well as the drug taker’s [[Social environment|environment]], and drug-related history.  Reinstatement of drug use after a period of non-use or abstinence is typically initiated by one or a combination of the three main triggers: [[stress (psychological)|stress]], re-exposure to the drug or drug-priming, and environmental [[sensory cue|cues.]] These factors may induce a [[neurochemical]] response in the drug taker that mimics the drug and thus triggers reinstatement.<ref name= murnane>{{cite journal | author = Murnane KS, Howell LL | title = Neuroimaging and drug taking in primates | journal = Psychopharmacology (Berl.) | volume = 216 | issue = 2 | pages = 153–71 | year = 2011 | month = July | pmid = 21360099 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-011-2222-7 }}</ref> These cues may lead to a strong desire or intention to use the drug, a feeling termed [[craving (withdrawal)|craving]] by Abraham Wikler in 1948.  The propensity for craving is heavily influenced by all three triggers to relapse and is now an accepted hallmark of [[substance dependence]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wikler A | title = Recent progress in research on the neurophysiologic basis of morphine addiction | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 105 | issue = 5 | pages = 329–38 | year = 1948 | month = November | pmid = 18890902 | doi = | url = }}</ref> Stress is one of the most powerful stimuli for reinstating drug use because stress cues stimulate craving and drug-seeking behavior during [[abstinence]].  Stress-induced craving is also predictive of time to relapse. Comparably, addicted individuals show an increased susceptibility to [[stressor]]s than do non-addicted controls.  Examples of stressors that may induce reinstatement include emotions of [[fear]], [[sadness]], or [[anger]], a physical stressor such as a footshock or elevated sound level, or a social event.<ref name= breese>{{cite journal | author = Breese GR, Sinha R, Heilig M | title = Chronic alcohol neuroadaptation and stress contribute to susceptibility for alcohol craving and relapse | journal = Pharmacol.

==Treatment==
Relapse treatment is somewhat of a [[misnomer]] because relapse itself is a treatment failure; however there exist three main approaches that are currently used to reduce the likelihood of drug relapse.  These include [[pharmacotherapy]], [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioral techniques]], and [[contingency management]]. The main goals of treating substance dependence and preventing relapse are to identify the [[needs]] that were previously met by use of the drug and to develop the skills needed to meet those needs in an alternative way.<ref name= Larimer/>

===Pharmacotherapy===
:''Related article: [[Drug rehabilitation]]
Various [[medications]] are used to stabilize an addicted user, reduce the initial drug use, and prevent reinstatement of the drug.  Medications can normalize the long-term changes that occur in the [[brain]] and [[nervous system]] as a result of prolonged drug use.  This method of therapy is complex and multi-faceted because the brain target for the desire to use the drug may be different from the target induced by the drug itself.<ref name= nader>{{cite journal | author = Nader MA, Czoty PW | title = PET imaging of dopamine D2 receptors in monkey models of cocaine abuse: genetic predisposition versus environmental modulation | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 162 | issue = 8 | pages = 1473–82 | year = 2005 | month = August | pmid = 16055768 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.162.8.1473 }}</ref> The availability of various [[neurotransmitter receptor]]s, such as the [[dopamine receptor D2]], and changes in the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] are prominent targets for pharmacotherapy to prevent relapse because they are heavily linked to drug-induced, stress-induced, and cue-induced relapse.  Receptor recovery can be [[downregulation and upregulation|upregulated]] by administration of [[receptor antagonists]], while pharmacotherapeutic treatments for [[neural adaptation|neruoadaptations]] in the medial prefrontal cortex are still relatively ineffective due to lacking knowledge of these [[adaptations]] on the [[molecular]] and [[cell (biology)|cell]]ular level.<ref name=vanden>{{cite journal | author = Van den Oever MC, Spijker S, Smit AB, De Vries TJ | title = Prefrontal cortex plasticity mechanisms in drug seeking and relapse | journal = Neurosci Biobehav Rev | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 276–84 | year = 2010 | month = November | pmid = 19932711 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.11.016 }}</ref><ref name= czoty2005/>

===Cognitive behavioral techniques===
The various behavioral approaches to treating relapse focus on the precursors and consequences of drug taking and reinstatement.  Cognitive behavioral techniques (CBT) incorporate [[Pavlovian conditioning]] and [[operant conditioning]], characterized by [[positive reinforcement]] and [[negative reinforcement]], in order to alter the [[cognitions]], [[thoughts]], and [[emotions]] associated with drug taking behavior.  A main approach of CBT is cue exposure, during which the abstinent user is repeatedly exposed to the most salient triggers without exposure to the substance in hopes that the substance will gradually lose the ability to induce drug-seeking behavior.  This approach is likely to reduce the severity of a relapse than to prevent one from occurring altogether. Another method teaches addicts basic [[coping (psychology)|coping mechanisms]] to avoid using the [[illicit drug]].  It is important to address any deficits in [[coping skills]], to identify the needs that likely induce [[substance dependence#Behavior|drug-seeking]], and to develop another way to meet them.<ref name= kadden/>

====Relapse prevention====
{{Main|Relapse prevention}}
[[Relapse prevention]] attempts to group the factors that contribute to relapse into two broad categories: immediate determinants and covert antecedents.  Immediate determinants are the environmental and emotional situations that are associated with relapse, including high-risk situations that threaten an individual’s sense of control, [[coping (psychology)|coping strategies]], and [[expectancy theory|outcome expectancies]].  Covert antecedents, which are less obvious factors influencing relapse, include lifestyle factors such as stress level and balance, and urges and [[craving (withdrawal)|craving]]s.  The relapse prevention model teaches addicts to anticipate relapse by recognizing and coping with various immediate determinants and covert antecedents.  The RP model shows the greatest success with treatment of [[alcoholism]] but it has not been proven superior to other treatment options.<ref name= Larimer/><ref name= kadden/>

===Contingency management===
{{Main|Contingency management}}
In contrast to the behavioral approaches above, [[Contingency management]] concentrates on the consequences of drug use as opposed to its precursors.  Addict behavior is [[reinforcement|reinforced]], by reward or [[punishment]], based on ability to remain [[abstinent]].  A common example of contingency management is a [[token economy|token]] or [[contingency management#Token economies|voucher system]], in which abstinence is rewarded with tokens or vouchers that individuals can redeem for various retail items.<ref name="pmid16445548">{{cite journal | author = Lussier JP, Heil SH, Mongeon JA, Badger GJ, Higgins ST | title = A meta-analysis of voucher-based reinforcement therapy for substance use disorders | journal = Addiction | volume = 101 | issue = 2 | pages = 192–203 | year = 2006 | month = February | pmid = 16445548 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2006.01311.x }}</ref>

==Animal models==
There are vast [[ethics|ethical limitations]] in [[drug addiction]] research because humans cannot be allowed to self-administer drugs for the purpose of being studied.<ref name= nader/> However, much can be learned about drugs and the neurobiology of drug taking by the examination of laboratory animals.<ref name= howellpsyc>{{cite journal | author = Howell LL, Votaw JR, Goodman MM, Lindsey KP | title = Cortical activation during cocaine use and extinction in rhesus monkeys | journal = Psychopharmacology (Berl.) | volume = 208 | issue = 2 | pages = 191–9 | year = 2010 | month = February | pmid = 19924404 | pmc = 2819208 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-009-1720-3 }}</ref> Most studies are performed on rodents or [[non-human primate]]s with the latter being most comparable to humans in [[pharmacokinetics]], [[anatomy]] of the [[prefrontal cortex]], [[social behavior]], and [[life expectancy|life span]].<ref name= howelljpet>{{cite journal | author = Howell LL, Murnane KS | title = Nonhuman primate positron emission tomography neuroimaging in drug abuse research | journal = J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. | volume = 337 | issue = 2 | pages = 324–34 | year = 2011 | month = May | pmid = 21317354 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.108.136689 }}</ref>  Other advantages to studying relapse in non-human primates include the ability of the animal to reinstate [[self-administration]], and to learn complex behaviors in order to obtain the drug.<ref name= nader/>  Animal studies have shown that a reduction in negative withdrawal symptoms is not necessary to maintain drug taking in laboratory animals; the key to these studies is operant conditioning and reinforcement.<ref name= murnane/>

===Protocols===
====Self administration====
To self-administer the drug of interest the animal is implanted with an i.v. [[catheter]] and seated in a primate chair equipped with a response lever.  The animal is seated in a ventilated chamber and trained on a schedule of drug self-administration.  In many studies the self-administration task begins with presentation of a stimulus light (located near the response panel) that may change colors or turn off upon completion of the operant task.  The change in visual stimulus is accompanied by an injection of the given drug through the implanted catheter.  This schedule is maintained until the animals learn the task.<ref name= porche>{{cite journal | author = Kirkland Henry P, Davis M, Howell LL | title = Effects of cocaine self-administration history under limited and extended access conditions on in vivo striatal dopamine neurochemistry and acoustic startle in rhesus monkeys | journal = Psychopharmacology (Berl.) | volume = 205 | issue = 2 | pages = 237–47 | year = 2009 | month = August | pmid = 19365621 | pmc = 2796974 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-009-1534-3 | url = }}</ref>

====Extinction====
[[Extinction]] in non-human primates is analogous, with some limitations, to abstinence in humans.  In order to extinguish drug-seeking behavior the drug is substituted with a [[saline (medicine)|saline]] solution.  When the animal performs the task it has been trained to perform it is no longer reinforced with an injection of the drug.  The visual stimulus associated with the drug and completion of the task is also removed.  The extinction sessions are continued until the animal ceases the drug-seeking behavior by pressing the lever.<ref name="pmid20386883">{{cite journal | author = Andersen ML, Kessler E, Murnane KS, McClung JC, Tufik S, Howell LL | title = Dopamine transporter-related effects of modafinil in rhesus monkeys | journal = Psychopharmacology (Berl.) | volume = 210 | issue = 3 | pages = 439–48 | year = 2010 | month = June | pmid = 20386883 | pmc = 2874656 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-010-1839-2 }}</ref>

====Reinstatement====
Reinstatement is the animal equivalent to relapse in humans.  After the animal’s drug-seeking behavior is extinguished a stimulus is presented to promote the reinstatement of that same drug-seeking behavior.  For example, if the animal receives an injection of the drug in question it will likely begin working on the operant task for which is was previously reinforced.<ref name= mcclung/> The stimulus may be the drug itself, the visual stimulus that was initially paired with the drug intake, or a stressor such as an [[startle response#acoustic startle response|acoustic startle]] or foot shock.<ref name= porche/>

====Neuroimaging====
[[Image:FMRI.jpg|thumb|left|A transverse segment fMRI scan showing activated regions in orange.]]
[[Neuroimaging]] has contributed to the identification of the [[neural]] components involved in drug reinstatement as well as drug-taking determinants such as the [[pharmokinetics]], [[neurochemistry]], and [[dose (biochemistry)|dose]] of the drug.  The neuroimaging techniques used in non-human primates include [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), which uses [[radiolabeled]] [[ligand]] tracers to measure neurochemistry [[in vivo]] and [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT).<ref name= murnane/>  [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) is widely used in human subjects because it has much higher resolution and eliminates exposure to [[radiation]].<ref name= howelljpet/>

===Limitations===
Although the reinstatement [[Medical guideline|protocols]] are used frequently in [[laboratory]] settings there are some limitations to the [[validity]] of the procedures as a model of [[craving (withdrawal)|craving]] and relapse in humans.  The primary limiting factor is that in humans, relapse rarely follows the strict [[extinction]] of drug-seeking behavior.  Additionally, human self-reports show that drug-associated [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] play a lesser role in craving in humans than in the laboratory models.  The [[validity]] of the model can be examined in three ways: [[formal equivalence]], correlational models, and [[functional equivalence]].  There is moderate formal equivalence, or [[face validity]], meaning that the model somewhat resembles relapse as it occurs outside of the laboratory setting; however, there is little face validity for the procedures as a model of craving.  The [[predictive validity]], which is assessed by correlational models, has yet to be determined for the procedures.   There is sound functional equivalence for the model, which suggests that relapse in the laboratory is reasonably similar to that in nature. Further research into other manipulations or reinforcements that could limit drug taking in non-human primates would be extremely beneficial to the field.<ref name="pmid12695875">{{cite journal | author = Katz JL, Higgins ST | title = The validity of the reinstatement model of craving and relapse to drug use | journal = Psychopharmacology (Berl.) | volume = 168 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 21–30 | year = 2003 | month = July | pmid = 12695875 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-003-1441-y }}</ref>

==Differences between sexes==
There exists a higher rate of relapse, shorter periods of [[abstinence]], and higher responsiveness to drug-related cues in women as compared to men. One study suggests that the [[ovarian hormones]], [[estradiol]] and [[progesterone]], that exist in females at fluctuating levels throughout the [[menstrual cycle]] (or [[estrous cycle]] in rodents), play a significant role in drug-primed relapse.  There is a marked increase in progesterone levels and a decrease in estradiol levels during the [[luteal phase]].  [[Anxiety]], irritability, and [[depression (mood)|depression]], three symptoms of both [[withdrawal]] and the human menstrual cycle, are most severe in the luteal phase.  Symptoms of withdrawal not associated with the cycle, such as hunger, are also enhanced during the luteal phase, which suggests the role of estradiol and progesterone in enhancing symptoms above the naturally occurring level of the menstrual cycle.  The symptoms of craving also increase during the luteal phase in humans (it is important to note that the opposite result occurs in female subjects with cocaine addiction suggesting that cyclic changes may be specific for different drugs of abuse).  Further, the drug-primed response is reduced during the luteal phase suggesting a time in the cycle during which the urge to continue use may be reduced.  These findings implicate a cyclic, hormone-based timing for quitting a drug of abuse and preparing for magnified symptoms of withdrawal or susceptibility to relapse.<ref name="pmid20488201">{{cite journal | author = Hudson A, Stamp JA | title = Ovarian hormones and propensity to drug relapse: a review | journal = Neurosci Biobehav Rev | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 427–36 | year = 2011 | month = January | pmid = 20488201 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.05.001 }}</ref><ref name="pmid18256593">{{cite journal | author = Czoty PW, Riddick NV, Gage HD, Sandridge M, Nader SH, Garg S, Bounds M, Garg PK, Nader MA | title = Effect of menstrual cycle phase on dopamine D2 receptor availability in female cynomolgus monkeys | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 548–54 | year = 2009 | month = February | pmid = 18256593 | doi = 10.1038/npp.2008.3 }}</ref>
