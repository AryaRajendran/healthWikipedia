'''Continuous spontaneous ventilation''' is any [[mode of mechanical ventilation]] where every breath is spontaneous (i.e., patient triggered and patient cycled).

==Dependent modes==
Some modes of mechanical ventilation require spontaneous ventilation, some of these include:

* [[Bilevel positive airway pressure]] (BPAP, BiPAP®)
* [[Continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP)
* [[Airway pressure release ventilation]]<ref name="pmid21285342">{{cite journal | author = Modrykamien A, Chatburn RL, Ashton RW | title = Airway pressure release ventilation: an alternative mode of mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome | journal = [[Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 78 | issue = 2 | pages = 101–10 | year = 2011 | month = February | pmid = 21285342 | doi = 10.3949/ccjm.78a.10032 | url = http://www.ccjm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=21285342 | issn = }}</ref> (APRV, (BiVent®)
