'''William Shainline Middleton, M.D., M.A.C.P.''' (7 January 1890 - 9 September 1975) was a prestigious American [[internist]] and [[military]] [[physician]]. He was one of the founders of the [[American Board of Internal Medicine]] and its first Secretary-Treasurer. Middleton was also the second Dean of the [[University of Wisconsin Medical School]].

==Early life and education==
Middleton was born in January 1890 in [[Norristown, Pennsylvania]], to Daniel and Anne Middleton, the second of their four children. His father was a salesman for a candy company.<ref>''http://search.ancestry.com/browse/view.aspx?dbid=7884&iid=PAT624_1379-0577&pid=110508829&ssrc=&fn=William+S&ln=Middleton&st=g'', Accessed 9-30-2009.</ref> Middleton entered the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1907 and obtained an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in 1911.<ref name="Warthin">Warthin TA: Memorial-- William Shainline Middleton.  ''Trans Am Clin Climatol Assoc'' 1977; 88: 57-59</ref> Thereafter, Dr. Middleton served as an intern at [[Philadelphia General Hospital]] under the direction of Dr. David Riesman. Middleton later stated that his own practices in physical examination of patients, teaching of medical students and house officers, and ethics were derived from those of Riesman.<ref name="Lowe">Lowe S: The University medical school-- a personal history. William Shainline Middleton: an interview. ''University of Wisconsin Archives Oral History Project'', 1972.</ref>

==Career at the University of Wisconsin==
Middleton was invited to join the faculty at the [[University of Wisconsin]] (UW; in Madison, WI) - then a 2-year medical school - immediately after his internship. He moved to Madison in 1912 as a Clinical Instructor in Medicine, principally serving students at the fledgling UW student health center, along with its director, Dr. Joseph Spragg Evans.<ref name="Oliver">Oliver R: ''Making the modern medical school: the Wisconsin stories'',  Science History Publications, Sagamore Beach, MA, 2002. ISBN 0-88135-362-0</ref> Middleton had broad interests regarding areas of clinical investigation, but they especially centered on [[sarcoidosis]], [[pneumoconiosis]], [[hematological]] disorders, [[infectious diseases]] and [[medical history]].<ref name="Becker">Becker IM: William Shainline Middleton: 1890-1975.

''Ann Med Hist'' 1941; 3rd Series #3: 461-486.</ref> He steadily rose through the academic ranks, and when the medical school became a four-year degree-granting entity in 1924 and built a university hospital, Middleton emerged as a central figure in the education of third- and fourth-year clinical clerks as well as house officers in [[internal medicine]]. He was known for his mastery of the [[physical examination]] <ref>Lawrence PF, Bell RM, Dayton MT, Ahmed MI (Eds): ''Essentials of General Surgery'', 4th Ed., Lippincott-Williams-Wilkins, Philadelphia, 2006; p. 430. ISBN 0-7817-5003-2</ref> and for his consummate professionalism. A novel and innovative program of "preceptorships" was initiated in 1926, wherein senior medical students were assigned to work with community practitioners throughout Wisconsin as a prelude to internship.<ref name="Oliver"/> That system of mentoring continues to this day. After the death of UW medical school Dean [[Charles Russell Bardeen]] in 1935, Middleton was named as his successor. The deanship was a difficult position at that time, because of growing factionalism among academic departments and their faculty members.<ref name="Lowe"/> In spite of that problem, the school flourished under Dean Middleton's guidance over 20 years. He continued to teach actively and to pursue his own research interests despite the administrative demands on his time, ultimately producing more than 300 contributions to the peer-reviewed medical literature.<ref name="Becker"/> In 1939, the [[American Board of Internal Medicine]] was constituted under the aegis of the [[American Board of Medical Specialties]]. Middleton was asked to serve as one of the eight initial Board members, and was named Secretary-Treasurer of the organization.<ref name="Warthin"/> He was instrumental in formulating a national curriculum for residency training in internal medicine and a structured system of examination to achieve board-certification in that [[medical specialty]].<ref>Middleton WS: The destiny of the American College of Physicians.  ''Ann Intern Med'' 1951; 35: 1-7.</ref>

==Military service==
[[File:wsmiddleton1918.jpg|thumb|250px|'''Captain W.S. Middleton in France, 1918. (US Army Photograph)''']]
Middleton served as a general medical officer with the U.S. Expeditionary Forces in France during [[World War I]], from 1917 to 1919. He remained in the [[U.S. Army Reserve]] following the end of the war, and, after the renewed outbreak of world hostilities in 1939, Middleton began to serve an increasingly active role as an advisor to the [[U.S. Army Medical Corps]]. When the U.S. entered the war, Middleton was recalled to active duty as Chief Consultant in Medicine, in the [[European Theater of Operations]].<ref name="Warthin"/> He had an Army counterpart-consultant in surgery, Dr. [[Elliott Cutler]],<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/redgold/innovators/bio_cutler.html Elliot Cutler]. Accessed 7-27-09.</ref> and, together, they shaped the process for the care of sick and injured American soldiers in Europe. In addition, Middleton was asked to care personally for several high-profile, high-ranking officers in both the American and British armies during the conflict.<ref>Clark PF: ''The University of Wisconsin Medical School: A Chronicle, 1848-1948''.  University of Wisconsin Press, Madison, WI, 1967; pp. 58-62. ASIN: B0014LYEME</ref> Middleton attained the rank of [[Colonel]] (O6) in the Army Medical Corps. He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]], the [[Legion of Merit]] with Oak Leaf Cluster, the [[Croix de Guerre]] with Palm, and the [[Order of the British Empire]].<ref name="Warthin"/>

==Service to the U.S. Veterans Administration==
In 1955, Middleton was appointed by President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] as Chief Medical Director of the Department of Medicine & Surgery of the U.S. [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]].<ref name="Becker"/> He relinquished his deanship and served the government in that capacity for eight years, but retained a presence at UW as well.<ref>[http://www.med.wisc.edu/education/md/resources/learning-communities/middleton-house/662 Middleton House]. Accessed 7-27-09.</ref> Programs for veterans that were developed during his tenure included improved access to [[physical rehabilitation]] services, [[mental health]] care, and treatment for [[cardiovascular disease]]s.<ref name="Becker"/> In recognition of that work, the Veterans Hospital in Madison was named the "William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Administration Hospital" in the mid-1970s.<ref>''http://www.madison.va.gov/''</ref>

According to the [[Veterans Health Administration Office of Research and Development]], the William S. Middleton Award is the highest honor awarded annually by their Biomedical Laboratory Research & Development Service "to VA biomedical research scientists in recognition of their outstanding scientific contributions and achievements in the areas of biomedical and bio-behavioral research relevant to the healthcare of veterans."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.research.va.gov/programs/blrd/research-awards.cfm |title=VA BLR&D Research Awards |first= |last= |author=Veterans Health Administration Office of Research and Development |authorlink=Veterans Health Administration Office of Research and Development |work=http://www.research.va.gov/ |publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref>
