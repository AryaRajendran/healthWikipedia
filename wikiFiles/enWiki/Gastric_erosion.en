'''Gastric erosion''' occurs when the [[mucous membrane]] lining the [[stomach]] becomes inflamed. Some drugs, as tablets, can irritate this mucous membrane, especially drugs taken for [[arthritis]] and muscular disorders, [[steroids]], and [[aspirin]]. A gastric erosion may also occur because of emotional [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], or as a side effect of [[burn]]s or stomach injuries.

== Symptoms ==
There is basically one symptom of gastric erosion: bleeding from the area where the stomach lesion is. [[Bowel movements]] may contain [[blood]]. [[Vomiting|Vomit]] may be bloody as well, but a gastric erosion may not cause vomiting. Blood may be black because it will be partially digested. Loss of blood may cause one to develop [[anemia]].

== Risks ==
Anemia and other problems related to blood loss may occur. Sometimes a person with a gastric erosion will experience severe bleeding all at once; here red (bloody) vomiting may occur, and/or black bowel movements.
