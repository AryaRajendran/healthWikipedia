'''Psychosis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ψυχή "psyche", for mind/soul, and -ωσις "-osis", for abnormal condition or derangement) refers to an abnormal condition of the mind, and is a generic [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] term for a mental state often described as involving a "loss of contact with [[reality]]". People suffering from psychosis are described as ''psychotic.'' Psychosis is given to the more severe forms of psychiatric disorder, during which [[hallucinations]] and [[delusions]], gross excitement or stupor and impaired [[insight]] may occur.<ref>Gelder, Michael (2005). "Psychiatry", P. 12. Oxford University Press Inc., New York. ISBN 978-0-19-852863-0.</ref>

The term "psychosis" is very broad and can mean anything from relatively normal aberrant experiences through to the complex and [[catatonic]] expressions of [[schizophrenia]] and [[Bipolar I disorder|bipolar type 1 disorder]].<ref>American Psychological Association (APA), 1994 The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Revision IV ([[DSM-IV]])</ref><ref>Gelder, Mayou & Geddes 2005</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Yuhas|first=Daisy|title=Throughout History, Defining Schizophrenia Has Remained a Challenge (Timeline)|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=throughout-history-defining-schizophrenia-has-remained-challenge|publisher=Scientific American Mind (March 2013)|accessdate=2 March 2013}}</ref>  Moreover a wide variety of [[central nervous system]] diseases, from both external substances and internal physiologic illness, can produce symptoms of psychosis. This led many professionals to say that psychosis is not specific enough as a diagnostic term. Despite this, "psychosis" is generally given to noticeable deficits in normal behavior (negative signs) and more commonly to diverse types of hallucinations or delusional beliefs (e.g. grandiosity, delusions of persecution). Someone exhibiting very obvious signs may be described as "frankly psychotic", whereas one exhibiting very subtle signs could be classified in the category of an "attenuated psychotic risk syndrome".

An excess in [[dopamine]]rgic signalling is traditionally linked to the [[Symptom#Positive_and_negative_symptoms|positive symptoms]] of psychosis, especially those of schizophrenia. This is thought to occur through a mechanism of aberrant salience of environmental stimuli.<ref name=Kapur>{{cite journal |author=Kapur S, Mizrahi R, Li M |title=From dopamine to salience to psychosis--linking biology, pharmacology and phenomenology of psychosis |journal=Schizophr.

</ref> Many [[antipsychotic]] drugs accordingly target the dopamine system; meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials of these drugs, however, show either no significant difference between drug and placebo, or a very small [[effect size]], suggesting that the pathophysiology of psychosis is much more complex than an overactive dopamine system.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Leucht|first=S|coauthors=D Arbter, RR Engel, W Kissling, JM Davis|title=How effective are second-generation antipsychotic drugs?

People experiencing psychosis may exhibit some personality changes and [[thought disorder]]. Depending on its severity, this may be accompanied by unusual or bizarre behavior, as well as difficulty with [[social interaction]] and impairment in carrying out daily life activities.

==Signs and symptoms==
People with psychosis may have one or more of the following: [[hallucination]]s, [[delusion]]s, [[catatonia]], or a [[thought disorder]], as described below. Impairments in [[social cognition]] also occur.<ref name="Fusar-Poli-2012">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fusar-Poli | first1 = P. | last2 = Deste | first2 = G. | last3 = Smieskova | first3 = R. | last4 = Barlati | first4 = S. | last5 = Yung | first5 = AR. | last6 = Howes | first6 = O. | last7 = Stieglitz | first7 = RD. | last8 = Vita | first8 = A. | last9 = McGuire | first9 = P. | title = Cognitive functioning in prodromal psychosis: a meta-analysis | journal = Arch Gen Psychiatry | volume = 69 | issue = 6 | pages = 562–71 | month = Jun | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.1592 | pmid = 22664547 }}</ref><ref name="Brown-2012">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Brown | first1 = EC. | last2 = Tas | first2 = C. | last3 = Brüne | first3 = M. | title = Potential therapeutic avenues to tackle social cognition problems in schizophrenia | journal = Expert Rev Neurother | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 71–81 | month = Jan | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1586/ern.11.183 | pmid = 22149657 }}</ref>

===Hallucinations===
A [[hallucination]] is defined as sensory perception in the absence of external stimuli. Hallucinations are different from [[illusion]]s, or perceptual distortions, which are the misperception of external stimuli.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=hallucinate&searchmode=none |title=hallucinate |accessdate=October 15, 2006 |last=Harper |first=Douglas |year=2001 |month=November |work=Online Etymology Dictionary }}</ref> Hallucinations may occur in any of the five senses and take on almost any form, which may include simple sensations (such as lights, colors, tastes, and smells) to experiences such as seeing and interacting with fully formed animals and people, hearing voices, and having complex tactile sensations.

[[Auditory hallucination]]s, particularly experiences of hearing voices, are a common and often prominent feature of psychosis. Hallucinated voices may talk about, or to, the person, and may involve several speakers with distinct personas. Auditory hallucinations tend to be particularly distressing when they are derogatory, commanding or preoccupying. However, the experience of hearing voices need not always be a negative one. One research study has shown that the majority of people who hear voices are not in need of psychiatric help.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Honig A, Romme MA, Ensink BJ, Escher SD, Pennings MH, deVries MW |title=Auditory hallucinations: a comparison between patients and nonpatients |journal=J. Nerv. Ment. Dis. |volume=186 |issue=10 |pages=646–51 |year=1998 |month=October |pmid=9788642 |doi=10.1097/00005053-199810000-00009 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0022-3018&volume=186&issue=10&spage=646}}</ref> The [[Hearing Voices Movement]] has subsequently been created to support voice hearers, regardless of whether they are considered to have a mental illness or not.

===Delusions===
Psychosis may involve [[delusion]]al beliefs, some of which are [[Paranoia|paranoid]] in nature. Put simply, delusions are false beliefs which a person holds on to, without adequate evidence. It may be difficult to change the belief even with evidence to the contrary. Common themes of delusions are persecutory (person believes that others are out to harm him), grandiose (person believing that he or she has special powers or skills) etc. Depressed persons may have delusions consistent with their low mood e.g: delusions that they have sinned, or have contracted serious illness etc. [[Karl Jaspers]] has classified psychotic delusions into ''primary'' and ''secondary'' types.  Primary delusions are defined as arising suddenly and not being comprehensible in terms of normal mental processes, whereas secondary delusions may be understood as being influenced by the person's background or current situation (e.g., ethnicity, religious beliefs, superstitious belief).<ref name=Jaspers>{{cite book |last=Jaspers |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Jaspers |others=Translated by J. Hoenig & M.W. Hamilton from German |title=Allgemeine Psychopathologie (General Psychopathology) |origyear=1963 | edition = Reprint |date=1997-11-27 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore, Maryland  |isbn=0-8018-5775-9}}</ref>

===Catatonia===
[[Catatonia]] describes a profoundly agitated state in which the experience of reality is generally considered to be impaired.  There are two primary manifestations of catatonic behavior.  The classic presentation is a person who does not move or interact with the world in any way while awake.  This type of catatonia presents with [[waxy flexibility]].  Waxy flexibility is when someone physically moves part of a catatonic person's body and the person stays in the position even if it is bizarre and otherwise nonfunctional (such as moving a person's arm straight up in the air and the arm stays there). 

The other type of catatonia is more of an outward presentation of the profoundly agitated state described above.  It involves excessive and purposeless motor behavior as well as extreme mental preoccupation which prevents intact experience of reality.  An example would be someone walking very fast in circles to the exclusion of anything else with a level of mental preoccupation (meaning not focused on anything relevant to the situation) that was not typical of the person prior to the symptom onset.  In both types of catatonia there is generally no reaction to anything that happens outside of them.  It is important to distinguish catatonic agitation from severe bipolar mania although someone could have both.

===Thought disorder===
[[Thought disorder]] describes an underlying disturbance to conscious thought and is classified largely by its effects on speech and writing.  Affected persons show loosening of associations, that is, a disconnection and disorganization of the semantic content of speech and writing. In the severe form speech becomes incomprehensible and it is known as "[[word salad]]".

== Psychiatric disorders ==
From a diagnostic standpoint, organic disorders were those held to be caused by physical illness affecting the brain (that is, psychiatric disorders secondary to other conditions), while functional disorders were considered to be disorders of the functioning of the mind in the absence of physical disorders (that is, primary psychological or psychiatric disorders). The [[materialism|materialistic]] view of the [[mind–body problem]] holds that mental disorders arise from physical processes; in this view, the distinction between brain and mind, and therefore between organic and functional disease, is an artificial one. Subtle physical abnormalities have been found in illnesses traditionally considered functional, such as [[schizophrenia]]. The [[DSM-IV-TR]] avoids the functional/organic distinction, and instead lists traditional psychotic illnesses, psychosis due to general medical conditions, and substance-induced psychosis.

Primary psychiatric causes of psychosis include the following:<ref name="ICD-10">[[World Health Organization]], [http://www.who.int/entity/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf ''The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders: Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines (CDDG)''], 1992.</ref><ref name="DSM-IV-TR">[[American Psychiatric Association]], [[DSM-IV|''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'']], fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR), American Psychiatric Association, 2000.</ref><ref name="Cardinal_2011_diagnosis_psychosis">Cardinal, R.N. & Bullmore, E.T., ''The Diagnosis of Psychosis'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 2011, ISBN 978-0-521-16484-9</ref>
* [[schizophrenia]] and [[schizophreniform disorder]]
* affective (mood) disorders, including severe [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and severe depression or mania in [[bipolar disorder]] (manic depression). People experiencing a psychotic episode in the context of depression may experience persecutory or [[Self-blame|self-blaming]] delusions or hallucinations, while people experiencing a psychotic episode in the context of mania may form grandiose delusions.
* [[schizoaffective disorder]], involving symptoms of both schizophrenia and mood disorders
* [[brief psychotic disorder]], or acute/transient psychotic disorder
* [[delusional disorder]] (persistent delusional disorder)
* [[chronic hallucinatory psychosis]]

Psychotic symptoms may also be seen in<ref name="Cardinal_2011_diagnosis_psychosis"/>
* [[schizotypal disorder]]
* certain [[personality disorders]] at times of stress (including [[paranoid personality disorder]], [[schizoid personality disorder]], and [[borderline personality disorder]])
* [[major depressive disorder]] in its severe form although it is possible and more likely to have severe depression without psychosis
* [[bipolar disorder]] in severe mania and/or severe depression although it is possible to have severe mania and/or severe depression without psychosis as well, in fact that is more commonly the case
* [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]
* [[induced delusional disorder]]
* Sometimes in [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]]

Stress is known to contribute to and trigger psychotic states. A history of psychologically traumatic events, and the recent experience of a stressful event, can both contribute to the development of psychosis. Short-lived psychosis triggered by stress is known as [[brief reactive psychosis]], and patients may spontaneously recover normal functioning within two weeks.<ref name=Jaunch_1988>{{cite journal |last=Jauch |first=D. A. |coauthors=William T. Carpenter, Jr. |year=1988 |month=February |title=Reactive psychosis. I.

B12 deficiency can also cause characteristics of psychosis and mania.  Most hospitals and mental facilities do not check for B12 deficiencies.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Psychoactive drugs===
{{main|Substance-induced psychosis}}
Various psychoactive substances (both legal and illegal) have been implicated in causing, exacerbating, and/or precipitating psychotic states and/or disorders in users. This may be upon intoxication, for a more prolonged period after use, or upon withdrawal.<ref name="Cardinal_2011_diagnosis_psychosis"/> Individuals who have a substance induced psychosis tend to have a greater awareness of their psychosis and tend to have higher levels of suicidal thinking compared to individuals who have a primary psychotic illness.<ref name="pmid21728034">{{cite journal |author=Grant KM, LeVan TD, Wells SM, ''et al.'' |title=Methamphetamine-associated psychosis |journal=J Neuroimmune Pharmacol |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=113–39 |year=2012 |month=March |pmid=21728034 |pmc=3280383 |doi=10.1007/s11481-011-9288-1 |url=}}</ref> Drugs that can induce psychotic symptoms include [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[cocaine]], [[amphetamine]]s, [[cathinone]]s, [[psychedelic drug]]s (such as [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and [[psilocybin]]), [[κ-opioid receptor]] [[agonist]]s (such as [[enadoline]] and [[salvinorin A]]) and [[NMDA receptor antagonists]] (such as [[phencyclidine]] and [[ketamine]]).<ref name="Cardinal_2011_diagnosis_psychosis"/>

;Alcohol
Approximately 3 percent of people who are suffering from [[alcoholism]] experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal. Alcohol related psychosis may manifest itself through a [[kindling (sedative-hypnotic withdrawal)|kindling mechanism]]. The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis is due to the [[long-term effects of alcohol]] resulting in distortions to neuronal membranes, [[gene expression]], as well as [[thiamin]] deficiency. It is possible in some cases that alcohol abuse via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance induced psychotic disorder, i.e. schizophrenia. The effects of an alcohol-related psychosis include an increased risk of depression and suicide as well as causing psychosocial impairments.<ref name=emedicine>{{EMedicine|med|3113|Alcohol-Related Psychosis}}</ref>

;Methamphetamine
Methamphetamine induces a psychosis in 26-46 percent of heavy users. Some of these people develop a long-lasting psychosis that can persist for longer than 6 months. Those who have had a short-lived psychosis from methamphetamine can have a relapse of the methamphetamine psychosis years later after a stress event such as severe insomnia or a period of heavy alcohol abuse despite not relapsing back to methamphetamine. Individuals who have long history of methamphetamine abuse and who have experienced psychosis in the past from methamphetamine abuse are highly likely to rapidly relapse back into a methamphetamine psychosis within a week or so of going back onto methamphetamine. Violence is common during a methamphetamine psychosis.<ref name="pmid21728034"/>

===Medication===
Administration, or sometimes withdrawal, of a large number of medications may provoke psychotic symptoms.<ref name="Cardinal_2011_diagnosis_psychosis"/> Drugs that can induce psychosis experimentally and/or in a significant proportion of patients include [[amphetamine]] and other [[sympathomimetics]], [[dopamine]] agonists, [[ketamine]], [[corticosteroids]] (often with mood changes in addition), and some anticonvulsants such as [[vigabatrin]].<ref name="Cardinal_2011_diagnosis_psychosis"/><ref>{{cite journal | author=Sander JW, Hart YM, Trimble MR, Shorvon SD | title=Vigabatrin and psychosis | journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry  | volume=54 | issue=5 | year=1991 | pages=435–9 | pmid=1865207 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.54.5.435 | pmc=488544}}</ref>

== Pathophysiology ==
The first brain image of an individual with psychosis was completed as far back as 1935 using a technique called [[pneumoencephalography]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=M T |authorlink= |coauthors=Nathan D, Elliot AR, Laubach C|title=Encephalographic studies in mental disease |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=92|issue=1|pages=43–67|publisher= |year=1935 }}</ref> (a painful and now obsolete procedure where [[cerebrospinal fluid]] is drained from around the brain and replaced with air to allow the structure of the brain to show up more clearly on an [[X-ray]] picture).

The purpose of the brain is to collect information from the body (pain, hunger, etc.), and from the outside world, interpret it to a coherent world view, and produce a meaningful response. The information from the senses  enter the brain in the [[primary sensory areas]].  They  process the information and send it to the secondary areas where the information is interpreted. Spontaneous activity in the primary sensory  areas may produce [[hallucinations]] which are misinterpreted by the secondary areas as information from the real world.

For example, a [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] or [[Functional MRI|fMRI]] scan of a person who claims to be hearing voices may show activation in the primary auditory cortex, or parts of the brain involved in the perception and understanding of speech.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Copolov DL, Seal ML, Maruff P, ''et al.'' |title=Cortical activation associated with the experience of auditory hallucinations and perception of human speech in schizophrenia: a PET correlation study |journal=Psychiatry Res |volume=122 |issue=3 |pages=139–52 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12694889 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S092549270200121X |doi=10.1016/S0925-4927(02)00121-X}}</ref>

Tertiary brain cortex collects the interpretations from the secondary cortexes and creates a coherent world view of it. A study investigating structural changes in the brains of people with psychosis showed there was significant [[grey matter]] reduction in the [[Temporal lobe|right medial temporal, lateral temporal]], and [[inferior frontal gyrus]], and in the [[cingulate cortex]] bilaterally of people before and after they became psychotic.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pantelis |first=C |authorlink= |coauthors=Velakoulis D, McGorry PD, Wood SJ, Suckling J, Phillips, LJ, Yung AR, Bullmore ET, Brewer W, Soulsby B, Desmond, P, McGuire PK |title=Neuroanatomical abnormalities before and after onset of psychosis: a cross-sectional and longitudinal MRI comparison |journal=Lancet|volume=25|issue=361 (9354)|pages=281–8 |year=2003| pmid = 12559861|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12323-9 }}</ref> Findings such as these have led to debate about whether psychosis itself causes  [[excitotoxicity|excitotoxic brain damage]] and whether potentially damaging changes to the brain are related to the length of psychotic episode. Recent research has suggested that this is not the case<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ho |first=BC |authorlink= |coauthors=Alicata D, Ward J, Moser DJ, O'Leary DS, Arndt S, Andreasen NC|title=Untreated initial psychosis: relation to cognitive deficits and brain morphology in first-episode schizophrenia|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=160|issue=1|pages=142–8 |year=2003| pmid = 12505813|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.1.142 }}</ref> although further investigation is still ongoing.

Studies with [[sensory deprivation]] have shown that the brain is dependent on signals from the outer world to function properly. If the spontaneous activity in the brain is not counterbalanced with information from the senses, loss from reality and psychosis may occur after some hours. A similar phenomenon is [[paranoia]] in the elderly when poor eyesight, hearing and memory causes the person to be abnormally suspicious of the environment.

On the other hand, loss from reality may also occur if the spontaneous cortical activity is increased so that it is no longer counterbalanced with information from the senses. The [[5-HT2A receptor]] seems to be important for this, since psychedelic drugs which activate them produce hallucinations.

However, the main feature of psychosis is not hallucinations, but the inability to distinguish between internal and external stimuli. Close relatives to psychotic patients may hear voices, but since they are aware that they are unreal they can ignore them, so that the hallucinations do not affect their reality perception.  Hence they are not considered to be psychotic.

Psychosis has been traditionally linked to the [[neurotransmitter]] [[dopamine]]. In particular, the [[dopamine hypothesis of psychosis]] has been influential and states that psychosis results from an overactivity of dopamine function in the brain, particularly in the [[mesolimbic pathway]]. The two major sources of evidence given to support this theory are that [[dopamine receptor D2]] blocking drugs (i.e., [[antipsychotic]]s) tend to reduce the intensity of psychotic symptoms, and that drugs which boost dopamine activity (such as [[amphetamines]] and [[cocaine]]) can trigger psychosis in some people (see [[amphetamine psychosis]]).<ref name=Kapur/> However, increasing evidence in recent times has pointed to a possible dysfunction of the excitory neurotransmitter [[glutamate]], in particular, with the activity of the [[NMDA receptor]].

This theory is reinforced by the fact that [[dissociative]] [[NMDA receptor antagonists]] such as [[ketamine]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] and [[dextromethorphan]] (at large overdoses) induce a psychotic state more readily than dopaminergic stimulants, even at "normal" recreational doses. The symptoms of dissociative [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] are also considered to mirror the symptoms of schizophrenia, including negative psychotic symptoms, more closely than amphetamine psychosis. Dissociative induced psychosis happens on a more reliable and predictable basis than amphetamine psychosis, which usually only occurs in cases of overdose, prolonged use or with [[sleep deprivation]], which can independently produce psychosis. New antipsychotic drugs which act on glutamate and its receptors are currently undergoing clinical trials.

The connection between dopamine and psychosis is generally believed to be complex.  While dopamine receptor D2 suppresses [[adenylate cyclase]] activity, the  [[Dopamine receptor D1|D1]] receptor increases it.  If D2-blocking drugs are administered the blocked dopamine spills over to the D1 receptors. The increased adenylate cyclase activity affects [[genetic expression]] in the nerve cell, a process which takes time. Hence antipsychotic drugs take a week or two to reduce the symptoms of psychosis. Moreover, newer and equally effective antipsychotic drugs actually block slightly less dopamine in the brain than older drugs whilst also blocking 5-HT2A receptors, suggesting the 'dopamine hypothesis' may be oversimplified.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jones HM, Pilowsky LS |title=Dopamine and antipsychotic drug action revisited |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=181 |issue= 4|pages=271–5 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12356650 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12356650 |doi=10.1192/bjp.181.4.271}}</ref> Soyka and colleagues found no evidence of dopaminergic dysfunction in people with alcohol-induced psychosis<ref>{{cite journal |last=Soyka |first=Michael |coauthors=Thomas Zetzsche, Stefan Dresel, and Klaus Tatsch |year=2000 |month=May |title=FDG-PET and [[IBZM]]-SPECT Suggest Reduced Thalamic Activity but No Dopaminergic Dysfunction in Chronic Alcohol Hallucinosis |journal=Journal of  Neuropsychiatry & Clinical Neurosciences |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=287–288 | pmid = 11001615 |doi= 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.12.2.287}}</ref> and  Zoldan et al. reported moderately successful use of [[ondansetron]], a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, in the treatment of [[levodopa]] psychosis in [[Parkinson's disease]] patients.<ref name=Zoldan_et_al_1995>{{cite journal |last=Zoldan |first=J. |coauthors=G.

Psychiatrist [[David Healy (psychiatrist)|David Healy]] has criticised pharmaceutical companies for promoting simplified biological theories of mental illness that seem to imply the primacy of pharmaceutical treatments while ignoring social and developmental factors which are known to be important influences in the aetiology of psychosis.<ref>{{cite book|last=Healy|first=David|authorlink=David Healy (psychiatrist) |coauthors= |title=The Creation of Psychopharmacology|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2002 |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-674-00619-4 }}</ref>

Some theories regard many psychotic symptoms to be a problem with the perception of ownership of internally generated thoughts and experiences.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Blakemore |first=SJ |authorlink= |coauthors=Smith J, Steel R, Johnstone CE, Frith CD |title=The perception of self-produced sensory stimuli in patients with auditory hallucinations and passivity experiences: evidence for a breakdown in self-monitoring |journal=Psychological Medicine|volume=30|issue=5|pages=1131–9|year=2000| pmid = 12027049|doi=10.1017/S0033291799002676 }}</ref> For example, the hallucination of hearing voices may arise from internally generated speech that is mislabeled by the psychotic person as coming from an external source.

It has been suggested that persons with [[bipolar disorder]]  may have increased activity of the left hemisphere compared to the right hemisphere of the brain, while persons  with [[schizophrenia]]  have increased activity in the right hemisphere.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lohr |first=JB |authorlink= |coauthors=Caligiuri MP|title=Lateralized hemispheric dysfunction in the major psychotic disorders: historical perspectives and findings from a study of motor asymmetry in older patients|journal=Schizophrophrenia Research|volume=30|issue=27 (2–3)|pages=191–8 |year=1997| pmid = 9416648|doi=10.1016/S0920-9964(97)00062-5 }}</ref>

Increased level of right hemisphere activation has also been found in people who have high levels of [[paranormal]] beliefs<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pizaagalli |first=D |authorlink= |coauthors=Lehmann D, Gianotti L, Koenig T, Tanaka H, Wackermann J, Brugger P. |title=Brain electric correlates of strong belief in paranormal phenomena: intracerebral EEG source and regional Omega complexity analyses|journal=Psychiatry Research|volume=100|issue=3|pages=139–154 |year=2000| pmid = 11120441|doi=10.1016/S0925-4927(00)00070-6 }}</ref> and in people who report [[mystical]] experiences.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Makarec |first=K |authorlink= |coauthors=Persinger, MA |title=Temporal lobe signs: electroencephalographic validity and enhanced scores in special populations|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=60|issue=3|pages=831–42 |year=1985| pmid = 3927256|doi=10.2466/pms.1985.60.3.831 }}</ref>
It also seems to be the case that people who are more creative are also more likely to show a similar pattern of brain activation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weinstein |first=S |authorlink= |coauthors=Graves RE |title=Are creativity and schizotypy products of a right hemisphere bias? |journal=Brain and Cognition|volume=49|issue=1|pages=138–51 |year=2002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0278262601914939 | pmid = 12027399 |accessdate=2006-08-19|doi=10.1006/brcg.2001.1493 }}</ref> Some researchers have been quick to point out that this in no way suggests that paranormal, mystical or creative experiences are in any way ''by themselves'' a symptom of mental illness, as it is still not clear what makes some such experiences beneficial and others distressing.

=== Neurobiology ===
<!-- I hope it's the correct place-->
In otherwise normal individuals, exogenous [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] can produce psychotic symptoms. [[NMDA receptor antagonists]], such as [[ketamine]], can produce a similar psychosis to that experienced in [[schizophrenia]].<ref>(Krystal,J Subanesthetic Effects of the Noncompetitive NMDA Antagonist, Ketamine, in Humans,Arch Gen Psychiatry, 1994)</ref>

Prolonged or high dose use of [[psychostimulants]] can alter normal functioning to be similar to the manic phase of bipolar disorder.<ref>(Curran, C, Stimulant psychosis: systematic review, British Journal of Psychiatry, 2004)</ref> NMDA antagonists replicate some of the so-called "negative" symptoms like [[thought disorder]] in subanesthetic doses (doses insufficient to induce [[anesthesia]]), and [[catatonia]] in high doses. Psychostimulants, especially in one already prone to psychotic thinking, can cause some "positive" symptoms, such as delusional beliefs, particularly those persecutory in nature.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosing the presence and/or extent of psychosis may be distinguished from diagnosing the cause of psychosis.<ref name="Cardinal_2011_diagnosis_psychosis"/>

The presence of psychosis is typically diagnosed by clinical interview, incorporating mental state examination.<ref name="ICD-10"/><ref name="DSM-IV-TR"/> Its extent may be established by formal rating scales. The [[Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale]] (BPRS)<ref>Overall JE, Gorham DR. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Psychol Rep. 1962;10:799-812</ref> assesses the level of 18 symptom constructs of psychosis such as [[hostility]], [[Suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]], [[hallucination]], and [[grandiosity]]. It is based on the clinician's interview with the patient and observations of the patient's behavior over the previous 2–3 days. The patient's family can also provide the behavior report. During the initial assessment and the follow-up, both positive and negative symptoms of psychosis can be assessed  using the 30 item Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS).<ref>Kay, S.R., Fiszbien, A., & Opler, L.A. 1987. The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANNS) for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia Bulletin, 13, pp261-276</ref>

Establishing the cause of psychosis requires [[clinical examination]], and sometimes special investigations, to diagnose or exclude secondary causes of psychosis; if these are excluded, a primary psychiatric diagnosis can be established.<ref name="Cardinal_2011_diagnosis_psychosis"/>

The treatment of psychosis depends on the cause or diagnosis or diagnoses (such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and/ or substance intoxication). The [[first line treatment]] for many psychotic disorders is [[antipsychotic]] medication (oral or intramuscular injection), and sometimes [[Inpatient care|hospitalization]] is needed. There is growing evidence that [[cognitive behavior therapy]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Birchwood |first=M |authorlink= |coauthors=Trower P |title=The future of cognitive-behavioural therapy for psychosis: not a quasi-neuroleptic |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=188 |issue= 2|pages=108–108 |publisher= |year=2006 | pmid = 16449695|doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.105.014985 }}</ref>, [[acceptance and commitment therapy]]<ref>{{cite web |title=APA website on empirical treatments |url=http://www.div12.org/PsychologicalTreatments/treatments.html |accessdate=2009-09-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Ruiz |first=F.

When other treatments for psychosis are ineffective, [[electroconvulsive therapy]] or ECT (also known as shock treatment) is sometimes applied to relieve the underlying symptoms of psychosis due to depression. There is also increasing research suggesting that [[animal-assisted therapy]] can contribute to the improvement in general well-being of people with schizophrenia.<ref name=Nathans-Barel_et_al_2005>{{cite journal |last=Nathans-Barel |first=I. |coauthors=P.

===Early intervention===
{{Main|Early intervention in psychosis}}
[[Early intervention in psychosis]] is a relatively new concept based on the observation that identifying and treating someone in the early stages of a psychosis can significantly improve their longer term outcome.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Birchwood |first=M |authorlink= |coauthors=P. Todd, C. Jackson |title=Early Intervention in Psychosis: The Critical Period Hypothesis |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=172 |issue=33|pages=53–59 |publisher= |year=1998 |pmid=9764127}}</ref> This approach advocates the use of an intensive multi-disciplinary approach during what is known as the [[critical period]], where intervention is the most effective, and prevents the long term morbidity associated with chronic psychotic illness.

Newer research into the effectiveness of [[cognitive behavioural therapy]] during the early pre-cursory stages of psychosis (also known as the "[[prodrome]]" or "[[at risk mental state]]") suggests that such input can prevent or delay the onset of psychosis.<ref>{{cite book|last=French|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul French (psychologist)|coauthors=Anthony Morrison|title=Early Detection and cognitive therapy for people at high risk of developing psychosis|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2004|location=Chichester |isbn=0-470-86314-5|unused_data=Paul French }}</ref>

==History==
The word ''psychosis'' was introduced to the psychiatric literature in 1841 by [[Karl Friedrich Canstatt]] in his work ''Handbuch der Medizinischen Klinik''. He used it as a shorthand for 'psychic neurosis'. At that time neurosis meant any disease of the [[nervous system]], and Canstatt was thus referring to what was thought to be a psychological manifestation of brain disease.<ref name=Burgy>{{cite journal|last=Burgy|first=M.|title=The Concept of Psychosis: Historical and Phenomenological Aspects|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|date=20 August 2008|volume=34|issue=6|pages=1200–1210|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbm136|url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/6/1200.full.pdf|pmid=18174608|pmc=2632489}}</ref> [[Baron Ernst Von Feuchtersleben|Ernst von Feuchtersleben]] is also widely credited as introducing the term in 1845,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Beer|first=M D |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Psychosis: from mental disorder to disease concept |journal=Hist Psychiatry|volume=6|issue=22(II)|pages=177–200|year=1995| pmid = 11639691|doi=10.1177/0957154X9500602204 }}</ref> as an alternative to [[insanity]] and [[mania]].

The term stems from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ψύχωσις'' (''psychosis''), "a giving soul or life to, animating, quickening" and that from ''ψυχή'' (''psyche''), "soul" and the suffix ''-ωσις'' (''-osis''), in this case  "abnormal condition".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23115982 |title=Psychosis, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work= |publisher=Douglas Harper|year=2001|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=psychosis&searchmode=none|accessdate=2006-08-19 }}</ref>

The word was also used to distinguish disorders which were thought to be disorders of the mind, as opposed to "[[neurosis]]", which was thought to be a disorder of the nervous system.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Berrios G E | year = 1987 | title = Historical Aspects of Psychoses: 19th Century Issues | url = | journal = British Medical Bulletin | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 484–498 | pmid = 3322481 }}</ref>  The psychoses thus became the modern equivalent of the old notion of [[Insanity|madness]], and hence there was much debate on whether there was only one [[Unitary psychosis|(unitary)]] or many forms of the new disease.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0957154X9400501702 | author = Berrios G E, Beer D | year = 1994 | title = The notion of Unitary Psychosis: a conceptual history | url = | journal = History of Psychiatry | volume = 5 | issue = 17 Pt 1| pages = 13–36 | pmid = 11639278 }}</ref> One type of broad usage would later be narrowed down by [[Julius Ludwig August Koch|Koch]] in 1891 to the 'psychopathic inferiorities' - later renamed abnormal personalities by [[Kurt Schneider|Schneider]].<ref name=Burgy/>

The division of the major psychoses into manic depressive illness (now called [[bipolar disorder]]) and dementia praecox (now called [[schizophrenia]]) was made by [[Emil Kraepelin]], who attempted to create a synthesis of the various mental disorders identified by 19th century [[Psychiatry|psychiatrists]], by grouping diseases together based on classification of common symptoms. Kraepelin used the term 'manic depressive insanity' to describe the whole spectrum of [[mood disorder]]s, in a far wider sense than it is usually used today.

In Kraepelin's classification this would include 'unipolar' [[clinical depression]], as well as bipolar disorder and other mood disorders such as [[cyclothymia]]. These are characterised by problems with mood control and the psychotic episodes appear associated with disturbances in mood, and patients will often have periods of normal functioning between psychotic episodes even without medication. [[Schizophrenia]] is characterized by psychotic episodes which appear to be unrelated to disturbances in mood, and most non-medicated patients will show signs of disturbance between psychotic episodes.

During the 1960s and 1970s, psychosis was of particular interest to [[counterculture]] critics of mainstream psychiatric practice, who argued that it may simply be another way of constructing reality and is not necessarily a sign of illness. For example, [[R. D. Laing]] argued that psychosis is a symbolic way of expressing concerns in situations where such views may be unwelcome or uncomfortable to the recipients. He went on to say that psychosis could be also seen as a transcendental experience with healing and spiritual aspects.

[[Arthur J. Deikman]] suggested use of the term "[[mystical psychosis]]" to characterize first-person accounts of psychotic experiences that are similar to reports of mystical experiences. [[Thomas Szasz]] focused on the social implications of [[Labeling theory|labeling]] people as psychotics, a label he argues unjustly medicalises different views of reality so such unorthodox people can be controlled by society. [[Psychoanalysis]] has a detailed account of psychosis which differs markedly from that of psychiatry. Freud and Lacan outlined their perspective on the structure of psychosis in a number of works.

Since the 1970s, the introduction of a [[recovery approach]] to mental health, which has been driven mainly by people who have experienced psychosis (or whatever name is used to describe their experiences), has led to a greater awareness that mental illness is not a lifelong disability, and that there is an expectation that recovery is possible, and probable with effective support.

==Other views==
A 2012 paper suggested that psychiatric conditions associated with psychotic spectrum symptoms may be possible explanations for revelatory driven experiences and activities such as those of Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Saint Paul.<ref>Murray, ED.; Cunningham MG, Price BH. (1). "The role of psychotic disorders in religious history considered". J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neuroscience 24 (4): 410–26. doi:10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214. PMID 23224447</ref>

==Subtypes==
Subtypes of psychosis include:
* [[Menstrual psychosis]], including circa-mensual (approximately monthly) periodicity, in rhythm with the [[menstrual cycle]].
* [[Postpartum psychosis]], occurring recently after [[childbirth]]
* [[Monothematic delusions]]
* [[Myxedematous psychosis]]
* [[Occupational psychosis]]
* [[Stimulant psychosis]]
* [[Tardive psychosis]]
* [[Shared psychosis]]
* ''Cycloid psychosis''

===Cycloid psychosis===
Cycloid psychosis is psychosis that progresses from normal to full-blown usually within a few hours, not related to drug intake or brain injury.<ref name=Marneros2004>[http://books.google.se/books?id=aI-BAIcrUYkC&pg=PA188 Page 188] in: {{cite book |author=Frank Pillmann; Andreas Marneros |title=Acute and transient psychoses |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-521-83518-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> In addition, [[diagnostic criteria]] include at least four of the following symptoms:<ref name=Marneros2004/>
* Confusion
* Mood-incongruent delusions
* Hallucinations
* Pan-anxiety, a severe anxiety not bound to particular situations or circumstances
* Happiness or ecstasy of high degree
* Motility disturbances of akinetic or hyperkinetic type
* Concern with death
* Mood swings to some degree, but less than what is needed for diagnosis of an [[affective disorder]]s

Cycloid psychosis occurs in people of generally 15–50 years of age.<ref name=Marneros2004/>
