'''Flupentixol''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), also known as '''flupenthixol''' (former [[British Approved Name|BAN]]), marketed under brand names such as '''Depixol''' and '''Fluanxol''', is a [[typical antipsychotic]] [[drug]] of the [[thioxanthene]] class. In addition to single drug preparations, it is also available as Anxiset, Deanxit, Mixit, a combination product containing both [[melitracen]] and flupentixol.

Flupentixol is not approved for use in the United States.

== Indications ==

It is also available under the name anxistream. Flupentixol's main use is as a long-acting injection given once in every two or three weeks to individuals with [[schizophrenia]] who have poor compliance with medication and suffer frequent relapses of illness.

Flupentixol is also used in low doses as an [[antidepressant]].<ref name="pmid7291129">{{cite journal | author = Robertson MM, Trimble MR | title = The antidepressant action of flupenthixol | journal = The Practitioner | volume = 225 | issue = 1355 | pages = 761–3 | year = 1981 | month = May | pmid = 7291129 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid6674820">{{cite journal | author = Pöldinger W, Sieberns S | title = Depression-inducing and antidepressive effects of neuroleptics.

== Pharmacology ==

Flupentixol acts as an [[receptor_antagonist|antagonist]] at various [[dopamine receptor|dopamine]] ([[D1 receptor|D<sub>1</sub>]]-[[D5 receptor|D<sub>5</sub>]]), [[serotonin receptor|serotonin]] ([[5-HT2 receptor|5-HT<sub>2</sub>]]), [[adrenergic receptor|adrenaline]] ([[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>]]), and [[histamine receptor|histamine]] ([[H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub>]]) [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s,<ref name="urlPDSP Database - UNC">{{cite web | url = http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/pdsp.php | title = PDSP Database - UNC}}</ref> without affecting the [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]s.<ref name="pmid7052344">{{cite journal | author = Golds PR, Przyslo FR, Strange PG | title = The binding of some antidepressant drugs to brain muscarinic acetylcholine receptors | journal = [[British Journal of Pharmacology]] | volume = 68 | issue = 3 | pages = 541–9 | year = 1980 | month = March | pmid = 7052344 | pmc = 2044199 | doi = | url = }}</ref>

Its antipsychotic effects are likely caused by D<sub>2</sub> and/or 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> antagonism, whereas its antidepressant effects at lower doses may be mediated by preferential D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>3</sub> [[autoreceptor]] blockade, resulting in increased postsynaptic activation.

== Adverse effects ==

The side effects of flupentixol are similar to most other typical antipsychotics, namely [[extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal]] symptoms of [[akathisia]], [[muscle tremor]]s, and [[muscle rigidity|rigidity]] and [[antihistamine]] effects like [[sedation]] and [[somnolence]]. However, it lacks [[anticholinergic]] adverse effects.
