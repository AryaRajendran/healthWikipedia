'''Giggle incontinence''', '''giggle enuresis''' or '''''enuresis risoria''''' is  the involuntary release of [[urine]] in response to [[giggle|giggling]] or laughter.  The [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] may empty completely or only partially.<ref name=BJUI/>  

Giggle incontinence is more common in children than adults, typically appearing at ages 5 to 7,<ref name=Medscape/> and is most common in girls near the onset of [[puberty]].<ref name=FPH/>  The condition tends to improve with age, with fewer episodes during the teenage years,<ref name=Medscape/>  but may persist into adulthood.<ref name=FPH/>  A survey of 99 student nurses indicated that about 25% had experienced such a wetting event during their lifetime, and about 10% were still susceptible in their late teens.<ref name=BJUI/>

Giggle incontinence is a special form of [[urge incontinence]],<ref name= utb/> and is not the same as [[stress incontinence]], which is generally brought on by participating in vigorous sport.<ref name=FPH/>

==Cause==
In voluntary [[urination]], the bladder's normally relaxed [[detrusor urinae muscle|detrusor muscle]] contracts to squeeze urine from the bladder.
One study, of 109 children diagnosed with giggle incontinence at Schneider Children's Hospital in New York, concluded that the cause of giggle incontinence is involuntary contraction of the detrusor muscle induced by laughter.<ref name=pmid12394756/>  
Because the complaint is difficult to reproduce under controlled conditions, its triggering mechanism is not clearly understood,<ref name=Urodynamics/> but may be related to [[cataplexy]], a sudden transient episode of loss of [[muscle tone]] often triggered by strong emotions.<ref name=CPN/>

==Social consequences==
Episodes of giggle incontinence are [[embarrassment|embarrassing]] and socially incapacitating, diminishing the quality of life.  Those having the condition learn to adapt by avoiding activities that may bring on laughter.<ref name=FPH/>  Other approaches include limiting fluid intake, trying to remain seated, and concealing leakage by wearing absorbent pads and dark clothing.<ref name=CanPar/>

==Treatment==
Favorable response to treatment with the [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] drug [[methylphenidate]] (Ritalin) has been reported,<ref name=FPH/><ref name=CPN/><ref name=pmid19695642/> but this treatment option is not acceptable to all patient families.<ref name=pmid19695642/> 
Dr. Lane Robson, of The Children’s Clinic in Calgary, Alberta, says "If a child is having a wetting episode once a month, medicating them daily is probably not a good treatment. If it’s a daily issue, you may have to make that decision."<ref name=CanPar/>
