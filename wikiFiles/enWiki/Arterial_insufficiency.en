'''Arterial Insufficiency''' is a lack of enough blood flow through the [[arteries]] typically caused by [[atherosclerosis]]. Arterial insufficiency can affect many different parts of the body. The specific [[symptoms]] may indicate which artery is involved. If heart arteries are involved, it can cause symptoms of [[heart attack]]. If [[brain arteries]] are involved, it can cause symptoms of [[stroke]]. If the arteries of the lower [[abdomen]] or legs are involved, you might have repeated episodes of leg cramping when you walk. Arterial insufficiency also can affect the arteries in the abdomen, causing pain after eating meals.

==Epidemiology==

*Symptomatic arterial insufficiency is present in 5% to 15% of the adult population over 55 years old
*Incidence and prevalence increases with age; rare in patients <40 years old.
*Males are affected more often than females in patients under 70 years old, whereas no gender differences observed in patients over 70 years old.

== Etiology ==
* Atherosclerosis - 70%
* Nonspecific aorto-arteritis - 10%
* CTD - 8%
**Marfan syndrome
**Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
**Erdheim syndrome (medianekroz)
*Other causes - 2%

==Atherosclerosis== 
A common disorder of the arteries elastic and muscular-elastic types (large and medium-sized), characterized infiltration into the vessel wall atherogenic apoprotein-ß-containing lipoproteins and the subsequent development of connective tissue, atheromatous plaques, organ and general blood circulation disorders

== Risk factor for atherosclerosis ==


# Irreversible<ol><li>age (40-50 years)</li><br /><li>male gender (males atherosclerosis appears more and 10 years earlier than women)</li><br /><li>genetic predisposition to the development of atherosclerosis</li>
# Reversible:<ol><li>smoking</li><br /><li>hypertension (blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg)</li><br /><li>obesity</li></blockquote>

# Potentially or partially reversible:<ol><li>hyperlipidemia</li><li>high cholesterol and / or triglycerides</li><li>Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus</li><li>low levels of high density lipoprotein (α-LA) in the blood (less than 35 mg / dL or 0.9 mmol / L)</li>
# Other possible factors:<ol><li>physical inactivity (lack of exercise)</li><li>mental and emotional stressors</li>

== Atherosclerosis ==
#multifocal process
#Begins in the subintimal layer
#Vessels target:
*aorta
*arteries of the lower limbs
*brachycephalic artery
*The coronary arteries

== Causes of impaired patency of arteries in atherosclerosis ==

*stenosis
*occlusion
*aneurysm

== Nonspecific aorto-arteritis ==

#Related to primary vasculitis
#Autoimmune damage to the adventitia of the artery media and subsequent fibrosis formation of local "coupling"

Macroscopically the aorta and its branches are transferred traces of inflammation:

The presence of dense fibrous capsule
The increase in para-aortic lymph nodes
Diameter of the aorta is increased due to thickening of the outer layers of the wall


== Histology ==
Outer shell is presented in the form of connective collagen bundles
Thickened muscle layer in the vasa vasorum
Proliferation, giperelastoz tunica
Smooth muscle and elastic membranes are fragmented between granulation tissue

in short 
#Multifocal process
#Vessels target:
#The branches of the aortic arch
#Thoraco-abdominal aorta
#Less commonly the iliac arteries
#Mostly young women
  

In children, the disease is often the type of SARS
After puberty - begins to dominate ischemic syndromes defeat respective pools

==Topical methods of diagnosis ==
*Digital subtraction aortoarteriografiya
*CT scanning of the virtual
*MRI
*Duplex ultrasonography

==Principles of conservative therapy ==

Antiplatelet therapy - Leading

Required: complete cessation of smoking, the compensation related diabetes and hypertension

diet
Normalization of body weight
Antiplatelet drugs and rheological
Lipid funds
Antispasmodic
Antioxidants
Efferent therapy
Physiotherapy

Vazaprostan (alprostadil)

Complex action (antiplatelet agents, selective spazmalytic)
Drug of choice for critical limb ischemia

==Indications for surgical treatment ==
Stenosing or occlusive lesions of the aorta and / or arteries, symptomatic limb ischemia
   
Aneurysm of the abdominal aorta

Local or diffuse enlargement of its
diameter greater than 3 cm

Takes the 10th place among the causes of death for men over 55
Prevalence:
2 - 5% of men over 60 years
6% of men older than 65 years (in the presence of hypertension or atherosclerotic occlusive        arterial aneurysm prevalence - 10%)
11% of men older than 75 years
4% of women over 65 years

==Aneurysm of the abdominal aorta ==
The disease is mainly of acquired character
The main reasons
Atherosclerosis - 85%
CTD - 6%
Nonspecific aorto-arteritis - 5%
Injuries - 4%


== Treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms==

Indications for elective surgical reconstruction:
The outer diameter of the aneurysm> = 4 cm
Outer diameter of aneurysm <4 cm and an increase of 0.5 cm in 6 months
Perioperative mortality rate of 3-5%
Alternative to surgical treatment - arthroplasty (CFR 1.5-2%)

Conservative therapy is indicated for:
Aneurysm diameter <4 cm
Increasing the diameter of less than 2 mm 


== Clinic carotid arteries ==

Numbness and paresthesias hands
Monoparezy (cortical type) and hemiparesis
Transient aphasia, dysarthria, cortical
Transient blindness in one eye
Homolateral Horner's syndrome
Optical-paretic and paretic-afatooptiko syndromes

== Instrumental methods ==

duplex scanning
transcranial Doppler
computed tomography
electroencephalography
ultrasound scanning
Radiopaque angiography 

== Indications for carotid reconstructions ==

Asymptomatic carotid stenosis of more than 60% and more
Symptomatic carotid stenosis greater than 50%
Ultrasound signs of the "unstable" plaque
Hemodynamically significant carotid artery pathological tortuosity




== Connective tissue dysplasia syndrome ==

Marfan Syndrome - a genetic defect in 15 pairs of chromosomes, resulting in disturbed synthesis of fibrillin, which is one of the main components of fibro-elastic connective tissue
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome - a congenital defect of the connective tissue. One of its forms (type IV) is associated with severe pathology of the cardiovascular system



=== Leading cause of death in Marfan's syndrome - cardiovascular complications  ===

Dilatation of the aortic root - (cause of death in 75 - 85%) 
Occlusion of the mouths of the coronary arteries Exfoliating aortic 
Prolapse and mitral regurgitation 
Dilatation of the left ventricle and heart failure 
Aortic valve insufficiency as a result of aortic root dilatation 
The risk of aortic rupture increases significantly when the diameter of the aorta is greater than 5.5 cm 


==Pathophysiology==

*Initial lesion is a [[fatty streak]] in [[Tunica intima|intimal layer]].
*Intermediate phase of insufficiency formation is [[smooth muscle]] [[Cell growth|proliferation]].
*Final phase of formation is a [[Atherosclerotic_plaques|fibrous plaque]] overlying a soft tissue core of [[lipids]] and [[necrotic]] debris.

==Diagnosis==

*Inspection may reveal [[muscle atrophy]] from disuse, trophic skin changes ([[loss of hair]], [[dry skin]]), or thickened nails.
*[[Arterial_insufficiency_ulcer|Ulcers]] or [[gangrene]] is present in [[Acute_limb_ischemia|critical limb ischemia]].
*Pulses should be palpated in the [[femoral artery|femoral]], [[popliteal artery|popliteal]], [[dorsalis pedis]], and [[posterior tibial artery|posterior tibial]] positions.

===Lab tests===

*Routine [[Medical_laboratory|laboratory tests]] show no changes
*Serum chemistry (complete [[blood count]], including [[platelet count]]; [[lipid profile]]; fasting [[blood glucose]] and [[hemoglobin]] A1C; [[creatinine|BUN/creatinine]]; [[homocysteine]])
*Noninvasive vascular laboratory
**Segmental limb pressures, [[Doppler_ultrasound|Doppler]] waveform analysis
**[[Treadmill]] testing
**Toe [[plethysmography]] and pressures 
**[[Medical_ultrasonography|Duplex]]

===Imaging===

*[[Angiography|Contrast angiography]]
*[[X-ray computed tomography|CT]] and [[Magnetic resonance angiography|MR angiography]]

==Differential diagnosis==

*[[Compartment syndrome]]
*[[Osteoarthritis]]
*[[Arterial embolus]]
*[[Vasculitis]]
*[[Buerger disease]]

==Treatment==

[[Smoking cessation]] and [[exercise]] therapy (regular walking) are useful both for treatment of arterial insufficiency and its [[prophylaxis]]. Two medications currently are approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for treatment of intermittent claudication: [[pentoxifylline]] (hemorheologic agent) and [[cilostazol]] (phosphodiesterase inhibitor).

===Surgery===

The type of operation depends on the anatomic level and extent of arterial disease:
*[[Aortofemoral]] or extra-anatomic bypass for ''aortoiliac disease''
*Infrainguinal bypass for ''[[femoral artery|femoral]]'', ''[[popliteal artery|popliteal]]'', ''[[Posterior tibial artery|tibial]]'' disease

===Diet===

While there is no direct association between arterial insufficiency and [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], a [[low fat]], [[cholesterol|low cholesterol]] [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] is generally recommended.

===Activity===
Regular [[Walking|walking exercise]] at least 30 minutes 3 times a week is recommended.
