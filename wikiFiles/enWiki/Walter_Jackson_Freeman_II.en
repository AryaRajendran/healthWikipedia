==Biography and early years==
Walter J. Freeman was born on November 14, 1895 to a privileged family.<ref name=rowland>{{cite journal|last=Rowland|first=Lewis|title=Walter Freeman's Psychosurgery and Biological Psychiatry: A Cautionary Tale|journal=Neurology Today|year=2005|month=April|volume=5|issue=4|pages=70–72|url=http://journals.lww.com/neurotodayonline/Fulltext/2005/04000/Walter_Freeman_s_Psychosurgery_and_Biological.18.aspx|accessdate=07/09/2011}}</ref> He was raised in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] by his parents. Freeman was also known for being a bit of an oddball and he complemented his theatrical approach to demonstrating surgery by sporting a cane, goatee, and a wide-brimmed hat.<ref name=rowland/> Working in the field of medicine ran in his family and his grandfather, [[William Williams Keen]], was well known as a surgeon in the [[Civil War]].<ref name=rowland/> His father was also a very successful doctor. Freeman attended [[Yale University]], which at the time was Yale College, beginning in 1912 and graduated with his undergraduate degree in 1916.<ref name=Yale>{{cite web|title=Guide to the Walter Freeman, Class of 1916, Yale College, Photograph Albums Documenting Life at Yale|url=http://drs.library.yale.edu:8083/fedora/get/mssa:ru.0657/PDF|publisher=Yale University Library Manuscripts and Archives|accessdate=07/08/2011}}</ref> He then moved on to study [[neurology]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania Medical School]]. While attending medical school he studied the work of [[William Spiller]] and idolized his groundbreaking work in the new field of the neurological sciences.<ref name=rowland/> William Spiller also worked in Philadelphia and was credited by many in the world of psychology as being the founder of neurology.<ref name=rowland/> Freeman applied for a coveted position working alongside Spiller in his home town of Philadelphia, but was rejected.<ref name=rowland/>

Shortly afterward, in 1924, Freeman relocated to [[Washington D.C.]] and started practicing as the first [[neurologist]] in the city.<ref name=rowland/> Upon his arrival in D.C., Walter Freeman began work directing labs at [[St. Elizabeth’s Hospital]].<ref name=rowland/> Working at the hospital and witnessing the pain and distress suffered by the patients encouraged him to continue his education in the field.<ref name=rowland/> Freeman earned his PhD in [[neuropathology]] within the following few years and secured a position at [[George Washington University]] as head of the neurology department.<ref name=rowland/>

The first systematic attempt at human psychosurgery is commonly attributed to the Swiss psychiatrist [[Gottlieb Burckhardt]].<ref>For example,

However, Kotowicz notes a difference, irregularly observed, among medical historians and medical practitioners in their location of the origin of psychosurgery. The latter group, he contends, tend to favour beginning the narrative with Burckhardt whilst the former group favour starting with Moniz.

In the context of early psychosurgery, Berrios unusually also refers to the operations performed in 1889 by a surgeon (Harrison Cripps) at the behest of the British psychiatrist Thomas Claye Shaw in which fluid was drawn from the brain of a patient diagnosed with General Paralysis of the Insane. While the purpose of the operation was aimed towards the alleviation of mental symptoms attendant on the condition the procedure did not aim to interfere directly with brain tissue and therefore it has been excluded from most conventional accounts of psychosurgery.

}}</ref> On November 12, 1935,  a new psychosurgery procedure was performed in [[Portugal]] under the direction of the neurologist and physician [[Egas Moniz]].<ref name=timeline>{{cite web|title=A Lobotomy Timeline|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5014576&ps=rs|publisher=NPR|accessdate=07/10/2011}}</ref> His new “[[leucotomy]]” procedure was used to treat patients with mental illness. Moniz became a mentor and idol for Freeman who modified the procedure renaming it the “lobotomy.”<ref name=timeline/> One year after the first leucotomy, on September 14, 1936 Walter J. Freeman performed the very first [[prefrontal lobotomy]] in the United States on housewife Alice Hood Hammatt of [[Topeka, Kansas]] beginning his now infamous career as a neurosurgeon in the United States.<ref name=timeline/> Freeman’s [[lobotomy]] procedure was assisted by fellow neurosurgeon and research partner, [[James W. Watts|James Watts]]. By November after only two months performing their first lobotomy surgery, Freeman and Watts had already worked on 20 cases including several second, follow-up operations.<ref name=rowland/> By 1942, the duo had performed over 200 lobotomy procedures and had published results claiming sixty three percent improved, 23 percent were reported to be unchanged and fourteen percent were worse after the surgery.<ref name=rowland/>

After almost ten years of performing lobotomies Freeman heard of a doctor in [[Italy]] named [[Amarro Fiamberti]] who operated on the brain through his patients’ eye sockets, allowing him to access the brain without drilling through the skull.<ref name=timeline/> After experimenting with novel ways of performing these brain surgeries, Freeman formulated a new procedure called the [[transorbital lobotomy]].<ref name=timeline/> This new procedure became known as the [[icepick lobotomy]] and was performed by inserting a metal pick into the corner of each eye-socket and moving it back and forth, severing the connections to the [[prefrontal cortex]] in the [[frontal lobes]] of the brain.<ref name=cordingley>{{cite web|last=Cordingley|first=Gary|title=Walter Freeman's Lobotomies at Athens State Hospital|url=http://www.cordingleyneurology.com/lobotomies.html|accessdate=07/12/2011}}</ref> He performed the transorbital lobotomy surgery for the first time in Washington D.C. on a housewife named [[Sallie Ellen Ionesco]].<ref name=timeline/> This transorbital lobotomy method did not require a [[neurosurgeon]] and could be performed outside of an operating room without the use of [[anesthesia]] by using [[electroconvulsive therapy]] to induce [[seizure]].<ref name=cordingley/> The modifications to his lobotomy allowed Freeman to broaden the use of the surgery, which could be performed in [[state mental hospitals]] throughout the United States that were overpopulated and understaffed.<ref name=cordingley/> In 1950 Walter Freeman’s longtime partner [[James W. Watts|James Watts]] left their practice and split from Freeman due to his opposition to the cruelty and overuse of the transorbital lobotomy.<ref name=timeline/>

Following his development of the icepick lobotomy, Freeman began traveling across the country visiting [[mental institutions]] in his personal van, which he called the "lobotomobile."<ref name="lisas history">{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Lisa|title=The Ice Pick Lobotomist: Dr. Walter Freeman|url=http://lisawallerrogers.wordpress.com/2009/01/16/266/|accessdate=07/11/2011}}</ref>  He toured around the nation performing lobotomies and spreading their use by educating and training staff to perform the operation. Freeman’s name gained popularity despite the widespread criticism of his methods following a lobotomy on President [[John F. Kennedy]]’s sister [[Rosemary Kennedy]], which left her with severe mental and physical disability.<ref name=rowland /> A memoir written by former patient [[Howard Dully]], called ''My Lobotomy'' documented his experiences with Freeman and his long recovery after undergoing a lobotomy surgery at 12 years old.<ref name=dully>{{cite book|last=Dully|first=Howard|title=My Lobotomy|year=2007|publisher=Crown|isbn=0-307-38126-9}}</ref> Walter Freeman charged just $25 for each procedure that he performed.<ref name=cordingley/>  After four decades Freeman had personally performed as many as 3,400 lobotomy surgeries in 23 states, despite the fact that he had no formal surgical training.<ref name=rowland /> In February 1967, Freeman performed his final surgery on [[Helen Mortensen]].<ref name=timeline /> Mortensen was a longterm patient and was receiving her third lobotomy from Freeman.<ref name=timeline /> She died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] as did many of his other patients{{Quantify|date=August 2011}} and he was finally banned from performing surgery.<ref name=timeline /> At age 57, Freeman retired from his position at [[George Washington University]] and opened up a modest practice in [[California]].<ref name=rowland />

==Contributions to psychiatry==
However controversial his techniques may have been, Walter Freeman did make a number of important contributions to the studies of psychiatry and neurology. Walter Freeman nominated his mentor [[António Egas Moniz]] for a [[Nobel prize]] and in 1949 Moniz won the Nobel prize in physiology and medicine.<ref name=timeline /> He pioneered and helped open up the psychiatric world to the idea of [[neurosurgery]] as a possible treatment for severe mental illness.<ref name=amex /> He also supported and helped to demonstrate the idea that mental events have a [[physiological]] basis.<ref name=amex /> Despite his interest in the mind, Freeman was “uninterested in animal experiments or understanding what was happening in the brain”.<ref name=rowland /> Freeman was also co-founder and president of the [[American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology]] from 1946 to 1947<ref name=rowland />  and a contributor and member of the American Psychiatric Association.<ref name=amex /> It is interesting to mention that, up to this day, the very idea of "biological" psychiatry and the physiological problems of mentally ill people remain controversial for the vast majority of mental illnesses.
