A '''wheeze''' (formally called "sibilant rhonchi" in medical terminology) is a continuous, coarse, whistling sound produced in the respiratory [[airways]] during breathing. For wheezes to occur, some part of the respiratory tree must be narrowed or obstructed, or airflow velocity within the respiratory tree must be heightened. Wheezing is commonly experienced by persons with a [[lung disease]]; the most common cause of recurrent wheezing is [[asthma attacks]], though it can also be a symptom of [[lung cancer]].

The [[differential diagnosis]] of wheezing is wide, and the cause of wheezing in a given patient is determined by considering the characteristics of the wheezes and the historical and clinical findings made by the examining physician.

== Characteristics ==
Wheezes occupy different portions of the [[respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] cycle depending on the site of airway obstruction and its nature. The fraction of the respiratory cycle during which a wheeze is produced roughly corresponds to the degree of airway obstruction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baughman RP, Loudon RG |title=Quantitation of wheezing in acute asthma |journal=Chest |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=718–22 |year=1984 |month=Nov |pmid=6488909 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6488909 |doi=10.1378/chest.86.5.718 |format= &ndash; <sup>[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3AQuantitation+of+wheezing+in+acute+asthma&as_publication=Chest&as_ylo=1984&as_yhi=1984&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup>}} {{dead link|date=November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Pasterkamp H, Tal A, Leahy F, Fenton R, Chernick V |title=The effect of anticholinergic treatment on postexertional wheezing in asthma studied by phonopneumography and spirometry |journal=Am Rev Respir Dis. |volume=132 |issue=1 |pages=16–21 |year=1985 |month=Jul |pmid=3160273 }}</ref> [[Bronchiole|Bronchiolar]] disease usually causes wheezing that occurs in the expiratory phase of respiration.

This is especially true if the wheeze is [[monotone|monotonal]], occurs throughout the inspiratory phase (i.e. is "holoinspiratory"), and is heard more proximally, in the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. Inspiratory wheezing also occurs in hypersensitivity pneumonitis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Earis JE, Marsh K, Pearson MG, Ogilvie CM |title=The inspiratory "squawk" in extrinsic allergic alveolitis and other pulmonary fibroses |journal=Thorax |volume=37 |issue=12 |pages=923–6 |year=1982 |month=Dec |pmid=7170682 |pmc=459459 |doi=10.1136/thx.37.12.923 }}</ref> Wheezes heard at the end of both expiratory and inspiratory phases usually signify the periodic opening of deflated [[pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], as occurs in some diseases that lead to collapse of parts of the [[lung]]s. 

The location of the wheeze can also be an important clue to the diagnosis. Diffuse processes that affect most parts of the lungs are more likely to produce wheezing that may be heard throughout the [[chest]] via a stethoscope. Localized processes, such as the occlusion of a portion of the respiratory tree, are more likely to produce wheezing at that location, hence the sound will be loudest and radiate outwardly. The pitch of a wheeze does not reliably predict the degree of narrowing in the affected airway.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Meslier N, Charbonneau G, Racineux JL |title=Wheezes |journal=Eur Respir J. |volume=8 |issue=11 |pages=1942–8 |year=1995 |month=Nov |pmid=8620967 |url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8620967 |doi=10.1183/09031936.95.08111942}}</ref>

A special type of wheeze is '''[[stridor]]'''. Stridor — the word is from the Latin, ''strīdor''<ref>Simpson JA, Weiner ESC (eds). "''stridor, n. 2''." ''Oxford English Dictionary'' 2nd ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. OED Online Oxford University Press. Accessed September 10, 2005. http://dictionary.oed.com.</ref> — is a harsh, high-pitched, vibrating sound that is heard in respiratory tract obstruction. Stridor heard solely in the expiratory phase of respiration usually indicates an upper respiratory tract obstruction, "as with aspiration of a foreign body (such as the fabled pediatric peanut)."<ref>{{cite book |author=Sapira JD, Orient JM |title=Sapira's art & science of bedside diagnosis |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2000 |isbn=0-683-30714-2 |edition=2nd }}</ref> Stridor in the inspiratory phase is usually heard with obstruction in the upper airways, such as the trachea, epiglottis, or larynx; because a block here means that no air may reach either lung, this condition is a medical emergency. Biphasic stridor (occurring during both the inspiratory and expiratory phases) indicates narrowing at the level of the [[glottis]] or [[subglottis]], the point between the upper and lower airways.

==Diagnosis==
{{globalize|section|the United States|date=December 2012}}
1 out of 3 preschool children and 2 out of 3 school children with recurrent wheezing/coughing are [[allergic]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} . The reaction creates an inflammation which, in turn, can lead to a variety of symptoms such as wheezing.

Over the last decade allergy has increased by 18% in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1881985,00.html |title=Why We're Going Nuts Over Nut Allergies - TIME |work= Time|accessdate=2 March 2009 | date=2009-02-26 | first=Alice | last=Park}}</ref> Today one child in four is allergic.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Early diagnosis of allergy is important for the development of the child later in life.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} There are many patients with symptoms suggesting [[eczema]], [[rhinitis]], [[hay fever]], [[asthma]] or wheezing.
