The '''biliary tract''' (or '''biliary tree''') is the common [[anatomy|anatomical]] term for the path by which [[bile]] is secreted by the [[liver]] then transported to the first part of the [[small intestine]], also known as the [[duodenum]]. A structure common to most members of the [[mammal]] family, it is referred to as a tree because it begins with many small branches which end in the common bile duct, sometimes referred to as the trunk of the biliary tree. The duct, the branches of the [[Common hepatic artery|hepatic artery]], and the [[hepatic portal vein|portal vein]] form the central axis of the [[portal triad]]. Bile flows in the direction opposite to that of the blood present in the other two channels. 

The name usually excludes the [[liver]],<ref>{{MeshName|Biliary+tract}}</ref> but sometimes does include it.<ref name="urlDorlands Medical Dictionary:biliary tract">{{cite web |url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/eight/000109910.htm |title=Dorlands Medical Dictionary:biliary tract |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Clinical significance==
Pressure inside in the biliary tree can give rise to [[gallstone]]s and lead to [[cirrhosis of the liver]].

Blockage can cause [[jaundice]].<ref name="urlDefinition: biliary tract from Online Medical Dictionary">{{cite web |url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?biliary+tract |title=Definition: biliary tract from Online Medical Dictionary |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

The biliary tract can also serve as a reservoir for intestinal tract infections.  Since the biliary tract is an internal organ, it has no [[somatic nervous system|somatic nerve supply]], and colicky pain due to infection and inflammation of the biliary tract is not a somatic pain. Rather, pain may be caused by luminal distension, which causes stretching of the wall. This is the same mechanism that causes pain in [[bowel obstruction]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Path==
<!-- An image might say more than these words ;-) -->
The path is as follows: 
* [[Bile canaliculi]] >> [[Canals of Hering]] >> bile ductules (in portal tracts) >> intrahepatic bile ducts >> left and right hepatic ducts >> 
* ''merge to form'' >> [[common hepatic duct]] >> 
* ''exits liver and joins'' >> [[cystic duct]] (from [[gall bladder]]) >> 
* ''forming'' >> [[common bile duct]] >> ''joins with'' >> [[pancreatic duct]] >> 
* ''forming'' >> [[ampulla of Vater]] >> ''enters duodenum''

==Pathology==
An obstruction of the biliary tract can result in [[jaundice]], a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes.
