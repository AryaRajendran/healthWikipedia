The '''right ventricle''' is one of four [[heart chamber|chambers]] (two [[atrium (anatomy)|atria]] and two [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]s) in the [[human heart]]. It receives [[Oxygenation_(medical)|deoxygen]]ated [[blood]] from the [[right atrium]] via the [[tricuspid valve]], and pumps it into the [[pulmonary artery]] via the [[pulmonary valve]] and [[pulmonary trunk]]. 

It is triangular in form, and extends from the right atrium to near the [[apex of the heart]]. 

==Boundaries==
Its anterosuperior surface is rounded and convex, and forms the larger part of the sternocostal surface of the heart. 

Its under surface is flattened, rests upon the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]], and forms a small part of the diaphragmatic surface of the heart. 

Its posterior wall is formed by the [[ventricular septum]], which bulges into the right ventricle, so that a transverse section of the cavity presents a semilunar outline. 

Its upper and left angle forms a conical pouch, the [[conus arteriosus]], from which the [[pulmonary artery]] arises. 

A tendinous band, called the tendon of the conus arteriosus, extends upward from the right atrioventricular fibrous ring and connects the posterior surface of the conus arteriosus to the aorta. 

The left ventricular wall is three times the thickness of the right.  The right ventricle wall is thickest at the base and thins towards the apex. 

The upper left corner of the right ventricle, where the deoxygenated [[blood]]  is pumped into the [[pulmonary artery]], is called the [[conus arteriosus|infundibulum]] or [[conus arteriosus]].

The cavity equals in size that of the [[left ventricle]], and contains roughly {{convert|85|ml|0}} in a normal adult.
