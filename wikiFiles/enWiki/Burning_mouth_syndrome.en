==Classification==
A burning sensation in the mouth may be primary (i.e. burning mouth syndrome) or secondary to systemic or local factors.<ref name="Scully 2008" /> Other sources refer to a "secondary BMS" with a similar definition, i.e. a burning sensation which is caused by local or systemic factors,<ref name="Maltsman-Tseikhin 2007" /> however this contradicts the accepted definition of BMS which specifies that no cause can be identified. "Secondary BMS" could therefore be considered a misnomer. BMS is an example of [[dysesthesia]], or a distortion of sensation.<ref name="Bouquot 2002" /> Some consider BMS to be a variant of [[atypical facial pain]].<ref name="Porter 2002">{{cite book|last=Porter|first=R.A. Cawson, E.W. Odell ; avec la collab. de S.|title=Cawsonś essentials of oral pathology and oral medicine.|year=2002|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0443071063|edition=7. ed.|page=216}}</ref> BMS has been subdivided into three general types, with type two being the most common and type three being the least common.<ref name="Scully 2008" /> Types one and two have unremitting symptoms, whereas type three may show remitting symptoms.<ref name="Scully 2008" />

* Type 1 - Symptoms not present upon waking, and then increase throughout the day
* Type 2 - Symptoms upon waking and through the day
* Type 3 - No regular pattern of symptoms

==Signs and symptoms==
By definition, BMS has no signs. Sometimes affected persons will attribute the symptoms to sores in the mouth, but these are in fact normal anatomic structures (e.g. lingual papillae, [[vein|varices]]).<ref name="Treister 2010" /> Symptoms of BMS are variable, but the typical clinical picture is given in the table.<ref name="Scully 2008" /><ref name="Zakrzewska 2005" /><ref name="Bouquot 2002" /><ref name="Treister 2010" /><ref name="Coulthard 2008" /><ref name="Glick 2003" /> If clinical signs are visible, then another explanation for the burning sensation may be present. [[Erythema]] (redness) and [[edema]] (swelling) of papillae on the tip of the tongue may be a sign that the tongue is being habitually pressed against the teeth. The number and size of [[filiform papilla]]e may be reduced. If the tongue is very red and smooth, then there is likely a local or systemic cause (e.g. eythematous candidiasis, [[anemia]]).<ref name="Bouquot 2002" />

==Causes==

===Causes of burning mouth syndrome===
About 50% of cases where there is a burning sensation in the mouth have no identifiable cause.<ref name="Scully 2008" /> The cause of BMS is unknown.<ref name="Coulthard 2008" /> Several theories have been proposed, and these are supported by varying degrees of evidence, but none is proven.<ref name="Bouquot 2002" /><ref name="Coulthard 2008">{{cite book|last=Coulthard [et al.]|first=P|title=Master dentistry.|year=2008|publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780443068966|pages=231–232|edition=2nd ed.}}</ref> As most people with BMS are postmenopausal women, one theory of the cause of BMS is of [[estrogen]] or [[progesterone]] deficit, but a strong statistical correlation has not been demonstrated.<ref name="Bouquot 2002" /> Another theory is that BMS is related to [[autoimmunity]], as abnormal antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor can be found in the serum of more than 50% of persons with BMS, but these levels may also be seen in elderly people who do not have any of the symptoms of this condition.<ref name="Bouquot 2002" /> Whilst salivary flow rates are normal and there are no clinical signs of a dry mouth to explain a complaint of dry mouth, levels of salivary proteins and phosphate may be elevated and salivary pH or buffering capacity may be reduced.<ref name="Bouquot 2002" /> Depression and [[anxiety]] are common in this group.<ref name="Kalantzis 2005" /> It is not known if depression is a cause or result of BMS, as it may develop in the setting of constant unrelieved pain and sleep disturbance.<ref name="Glick 2003" /><ref name="Grushka 2002" /> BMS has been proposed to be a [[psychosomatic illness]], caused by [[cancerophobia]] or other form of [[hypochondriasis]].<ref name="Kalantzis 2005" /> Chronic low-grade trauma due to parafunctional habits (e.g. rubbing the tongue against the teeth or pressing it against the palate), may be involved.<ref name="Glick 2003" /> BMS is more common in persons with [[Parkinson’s disease]], so it has been suggested that it is a disorder of reduced pain threshold and increased sensitivity. Often people with BMS have unusually raised taste sensitivity ("super tasters")<ref name="Scully 2008" /> [[Dysgeusia]] (usually a bitter or metallic taste) is present in about 60% of people with BMS, a factor which lead to the concept of a defect in sensory peripheral neural mechanisms.<ref name="Glick 2003" /> Changes in the oral environment, such as changes in the composition of saliva, may induce neuropathy or interruption of nerve transduction.<ref name="Scully 2008" /><ref name="Coulthard 2008" /> The onset of BMS is often spontaneous, although it may be gradual. There is sometimes a correlation with a major life event or stressful period in life.<ref name="Treister 2010" /> In women, the onset of BMS is most likely three to twelve years following menopause.<ref name="Bouquot 2002" />

Several local and systemic factors can give a burning sensation in the mouth without any clinical signs, and therefore may be [[misdiagnosis|misdiagnosed]] as BMS. Other causes of a burning mouth sensation may have clinical signs in the mouth or elsewhere on the body. One suggested cause of burning mouth pain is a contact sensitivity [[Type IV hypersensitivity]] in the oral tissues to common substances such as [[sodium lauryl sulfate]], [[cinnamaldehyde]] or dental materials.<ref name="Andrews"/> However, inflammatory, lichenoid (lesions resembling oral [[lichen planus]]), or [[mouth ulcer|ulcerative]] lesions are present in cases of true contact sensitivity.<ref name="Glick 2003">{{cite book|last=Glick|first=Martin S. Greenberg, Michael|title=Burket's oral medicine diagnosis & treatment|year=2003|publisher=BC Decker|location=Hamilton, Ont.|isbn=1550091867|pages=332–333|edition=10th ed.}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
BMS is a [[diagnosis of exclusion]], i.e. all other explanations for the symptoms are ruled out before the diagnosis is made.<ref name="Scully 2008" /><ref name="Maltsman-Tseikhin 2007">{{cite journal|last=Maltsman-Tseikhin|first=A|coauthors=Moricca, P; Niv, D|title=Burning mouth syndrome: will better understanding yield better management?|journal=Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain|date=2007 Jun|volume=7|issue=2|pages=151–62|pmid=17559486}}</ref> There are no clinically useful investigations that would help to support a diagnosis of BMS<ref name="Zakrzewska 2005" /> (by definition all tests would have normal results),<ref name="Scully 2008" /> but [[blood test]]s and / or [[urinalysis]] may be useful to rule out anemia, deficiency states, hypothyroidism and diabetes. Investigation of a dry mouth symptom may involve [[sialometry]], which objectively determines if there is any reduction of the salivary flow rate (hyposalivation). Oral candidiasis can be tested for with use of a swabs, smears, an oral rinse or saliva samples.<ref name="Coulthard 2008" />  It has been suggested that allergy testing (e.g. [[patch test (medicine)|patch test]]) is inappropriate in the absence of a clear history and clinical signs in people with a burning sensation in the mouth.<ref name="Coulthard 2008" /> The diagnosis of a people with a burning symptom may also involve psychologic screening e.g. depression questionnaires.<ref name="Scully 2008" />

==Treatment==
<!-- DO NOT ADD PRIMARY SOURCES TO THIS SECTION ; AS PER [[WP:MEDRS]] -->
If a cause can be identified for a burning sensation in the mouth, then treatment of these underlying factor(s) will be cause related, and the symptom may resolve or persist despite treatment (which confirms a diagnosis of BMS).<ref name="Coulthard 2008" /> BMS has been traditionally treated by reassurance and with [[antidepressant]]s, [[anxiolytic]]s or [[anticonvulsant]]s. However a [[systematic review]] of treatments for BMS concluded that clear, conclusive evidence of an effective treatment was not available in published research.<ref name="Zakrzewska 2005" /> There is a suggestion that [[Alpha lipoic acid]] and [[clonazepam]] (a [[benzodiazepine]]) may have some benefit, but the research methods used in these [[randomized control trial]]s were imperfect or their results have not been corroborated by multiple trials. Similarly with the results of one randomized control trial which reported some evidence that [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] may be beneficial.<ref name="Zakrzewska 2005" />
<!-- DO NOT ADD PRIMARY SOURCES TO THIS SECTION ; AS PER [[WP:MEDRS]] -->

==Prognosis==
BMS is benign (importantly, it is not a symptom of [[oral cancer]]), but as a cause of chronic pain which is poorly controlled, it can detriment [[quality of life]], and may become a fixation which cannot be ignored, thus interfering with work and other daily activities.<ref name="Treister 2010" /> Two thirds of people with BMS have a spontaneous partial recovery six to seven years after the initial onset, but in others the condition is permanent.<ref name="Bouquot 2002" /><ref name="Grushka 2002" /> Recovery is often preceded by a change in the character of the symptom from constant to intermittent.<ref name="Grushka 2002" /> No clinical factors predicting recovery have been noted.<ref name="Grushka 2002" />

==Epidemiology==
BMS is fairly common worldwide, and affects up to five individuals per 100,000 general population. People with BMS are more likely to be middle aged or elderly, and females are three to seven times more likely to have BMS than males.<ref name="Scully 2008" /><ref>Greenberg MS; Glick M; Ship JA. Burket's Oral Medicine. 11th edition. 2012</ref> Some report a female to male ratio of as much as 33 to 1.<ref name="Mock 2010" /> BMS is reported in about 10-40% of women seeking medical treatment for [[menopause|menopausal]] symptoms, and BMS occurs in about 14% of postmenopausal women.<ref name="Bouquot 2002" /><ref name="Grushka 2002">{{cite journal|last=Grushka|first=M|coauthors=Epstein, JB; Gorsky, M|title=Burning mouth syndrome.|journal=American family physician|date=2002 Feb 15|volume=65|issue=4|pages=615–20|pmid=11871678}}</ref> Males and younger individuals of both sexes are sometimes affected.<ref name="Treister 2010">{{cite book|last=Treister|first=Jean M.
