'''Erectile dysfunction''' ('''ED''') is [[sexual dysfunction]] characterized by the inability to develop or maintain an [[erection]] of the [[human penis|penis]] during sexual performance.<ref>[http://www.muschealth.com/gs/glossary.aspx?pageid=P00522 Erectile dysfunction] glossary - [[MUSC]] Health</ref> 

A penile erection is the [[hydraulic]] effect of [[blood]] entering and being retained in sponge-like bodies within the penis. The process is often initiated as a result of [[sexual arousal]], when signals are transmitted from the [[Human brain|brain]] to [[nerves]] in the penis.  Erectile dysfunction is indicated when an erection is difficult to produce.  There are various circulatory causes, including alteration of the [[voltage-gated potassium channel]], as in [[arsenic poisoning]] from drinking water.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Risk of erectile dysfunction induced by arsenic exposure through well water consumption in Taiwan|authors=Hsieh FI, Hwang TS, Hsieh YC, Lo HC, Su CT, Hsu HS, Chiou HY, Chen CJ|location=School of Public Health, Topnotch Stroke Research Center, [[Taipei Medical University]], Taipei 110, Taiwan|pmid=18414639|doi=10.1289/ehp.10930|journal=Environ Health Perspect.|date=2008 Apr|volume=116|issue=4|pages=532–6}}</ref> The most important organic causes are [[cardiovascular]] disease and [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], neurological problems (for example, trauma from [[prostatectomy]] surgery), [[hormones|hormonal]] insufficiencies ([[hypogonadism]]) and [[Adverse drug reaction|drug side effects]]. 

Psychological impotence is where erection or penetration fails due to [[thought]]s or [[feeling]]s (psychological reasons) rather than physical impossibility; this is somewhat less frequent but often can be helped. Notably in psychological impotence, there is a strong [[placebo effect|response to placebo treatment]]. Erectile dysfunction, tied closely as it is about ideas of physical well being, can have severe psychological consequences.

Besides treating the underlying causes such as potassium deficiency or arsenic contamination of drinking water, the first line treatment of erectile dysfunction consists of a trial of [[PDE5 inhibitor]] drugs (the first of which was [[sildenafil]] or Viagra). In some cases, treatment can involve [[prostaglandin]] tablets in the [[urethra]], injections into the penis, a [[penile prosthesis]], a [[penis pump]] or vascular reconstructive surgery.<ref name="pmid15947645">{{cite journal |author=Montague DK |title=Chapter 1: The management of erectile dysfunction: an AUA update |journal=J.

The Latin term ''impotentia coeundi'' describes simple inability to insert the penis into the [[vagina]]. It is now mostly replaced by more precise terms. {{Vague|date=May 2010}} The study of erectile dysfunction within medicine is covered by [[andrology]], a sub-field within [[urology]].

==Signs and symptoms==

Erectile dysfunction is characterized by the regular or repeated inability to obtain or maintain an [[erection]]. It is analyzed in several ways:

* Obtaining full erections at some times, such as when asleep (when the mind and psychological issues, if any, are less present), tends to suggest that the physical structures are functionally working.
* Other factors leading to erectile dysfunction are [[diabetes mellitus]] (causing [[neuropathy]]).

==Causes==
* Drugs (anti-depressants ([[SSRI]]s) and  [[nicotine]] are most common)
* Neurogenic disorders<ref name=msn>{{cite web | title =Erectile Dysfunction causes| publisher=Healthwise | work =Erection Problems (Erectile Dysfunction) | url=http://health.msn.com/centers/mensexualhealth/articlepage.aspx?cp-documentid=100062424 | year = 2006 | accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref>{{dead link|date=February 2013}}

A few causes of impotence may be [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] (medically caused).

Surgical intervention for a number of conditions may remove anatomical structures necessary to erection, damage nerves, or impair blood supply. Complete removal of the prostate  gland or external beam radiotherapy of the gland are common causes of impotence; both are treatments for prostate cancer.

ED can also be associated with bicycling due to both neurological and vascular problems due to compression.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sommer|first=F|coauthors=Goldstein, I; Korda, JB|title=Bicycle riding and erectile dysfunction: a review.|journal=The journal of sexual medicine|date=2010 Jul|volume=7|issue=7|pages=2346–58|pmid=20102446}}</ref> The increase risk appears to be about 1.7 fold.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=V|coauthors=Munarriz, R; Goldstein, I|title=Bicycle riding and erectile dysfunction: an increase in interest (and concern).|journal=The journal of sexual medicine|date=2005 Sep|volume=2|issue=5|pages=596–604|pmid=16422816}}</ref>

February 2011: Men who use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 3 times a day for more than 3 months are at a 22 percent increased risk of erectile dysfunction. A link between NSAID use and erectile dysfunction still existed for different age, race, ethnicity, smoker, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, coronary diasease and other health problems. But due to benefit of NSAID, it's too early for men to avoid NSAIDs based solely on the research stated at [[Journal of Urology]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://yourlife.usatoday.com/health/story/2011/03/New-study-links-pain-relievers-to-erectile-dysfunction/44363996/1?csp=34news&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+usatoday-NewsTopStories+%28News+-+Top+Stories%29 | work=USA Today | title=Most Popular E-mail Newsletter}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
Penile erection is managed by two mechanisms: the reflex erection, which is achieved by directly touching the penile shaft, and the psychogenic erection, which is achieved by erotic or emotional stimuli. The former uses the peripheral nerves and the lower parts of the spinal cord, whereas the latter uses the [[limbic system]] of the [[Human brain|brain]]. In both conditions, an intact neural system is required for a successful and complete erection. Stimulation of the penile shaft by the [[nervous system]] leads to the secretion of [[nitric oxide]] (NO), which causes the relaxation of smooth muscles of [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpora cavernosa]] (the main erectile tissue of penis), and subsequently penile erection.  Additionally, adequate levels of [[testosterone]] (produced by the [[testes]]) and an intact [[pituitary gland]] are required for the development of a healthy [[erectile system]]. As can be understood from the mechanisms of a normal erection, impotence may develop due to hormonal deficiency, disorders of the neural system, lack of adequate penile blood supply or psychological problems.  Restriction of blood flow can arise from impaired [[endothelial]] function due to the usual causes associated with [[coronary artery disease]], but can also be caused by [[over-illumination|prolonged exposure to bright light]].

==Diagnosis==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
There are no formal tests to diagnose erectile dysfunction. Some [[blood test]]s are generally done to exclude underlying disease, such as [[hypogonadism]] and [[prolactinoma]]. [[Diabetes]] is considered a disorder, but is also a risk. Impotence is also related to generally poor physical health, poor dietary habits, [[obesity]], and most specifically [[cardiovascular disease]] such as [[coronary artery disease]] and [[peripheral vascular disease]].

A useful and simple way to distinguish between physiological and psychological impotence is to determine whether the patient ''ever'' has an erection. If ''never'', the problem is likely to be physiological; if ''sometimes'' (however rarely), it could be physiological or psychological.  The current diagnostic and statistical manual of mental diseases ([[DSM-IV]]) has included a listing for impotence.

;Duplex ultrasound:[[Duplex ultrasound]] is used to evaluate blood flow, venous leak, signs of atherosclerosis, and scarring or calcification of erectile tissue. Injecting [[prostaglandin]], a hormone-like stimulator produced in the body, induces erection. Ultrasound is then used to see vascular dilation and measure penile [[blood pressure]].

;Penile nerves function:Tests such as the [[bulbocavernosus reflex]] test are used to determine if there is sufficient nerve sensation in the penis. The physician squeezes the glans (head) of the penis, which immediately causes the anus to contract if nerve function is normal. A physician measures the latency between squeeze and contraction by observing the anal sphincter or by feeling it with a gloved finger inserted past the anus.

;Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT):It is normal for a man to have five to six erections during sleep, especially during rapid eye movement (REM). Their absence may indicate a problem with nerve function or blood supply in the penis. There are two methods for measuring changes in penile rigidity and circumference during nocturnal erection: snap gauge and strain gauge. A significant proportion of men who have no sexual dysfunction nonetheless do not have regular nocturnal erections.

;Penile biothesiometry:This test uses electromagnetic vibration to evaluate sensitivity and nerve function in the glans and shaft of the penis.

;Dynamic infusion cavernosometry (DICC): technique in which fluid is pumped into the penis at a known rate and pressure. It gives a measurement of the vascular pressure in the corpus cavernosum during an erection.

;Corpus cavernosometry:[[#Corpus Cavernosometry|Cavernosography]] measurement of the vascular pressure in the corpus cavernosum.  Saline is infused under pressure into the corpus cavernosum with a butterfly needle, and the flow rate needed to maintain an erection indicates the degree of venous leakage. The leaking veins responsible may be visualised by infusing a mixture of saline and x ray contrast medium and performing a cavernosogram.;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dawson C, Whitfield H |title=ABC of urology. Subfertility and male sexual dysfunction |journal=BMJ |volume=312 |issue=7035 |pages=902–5 |year=1996 |month=April |pmid=8611887 |pmc=2350600 |doi= |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/312/7035/902}}</ref> Digital Subtraction Angiography: In DSA, the images are acquired digitally.

;Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA): This is similar to [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. Magnetic resonance angiography uses magnetic fields and radio waves to provide detailed images of the blood vessels. Doctors may inject a "contrast agent" into the patient's bloodstream that causes vascular tissues to stand out against other tissues. The contrast agent provides for enhanced information regarding blood supply and vascular anomalies.

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the cause.

[[Exercise]], particularly [[aerobic exercise]] is an effective treatment for erectile dysfunction.<ref>[http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/abstract/139/3/161 Sexual Function in Men Older Than 50 Years of Age], annals.org, August 5, 2003</ref>{{Better source|date=May 2010}}

When pharmacological methods fail, a purpose-designed external vacuum pump can be used to attain erection, with a separate compression ring fitted to the penis to maintain it. These pumps should be distinguished from other [[penis pump]]s (supplied without compression rings) which, rather than being used for temporary treatment of impotence, are claimed to increase penis length if used frequently, or vibrate as an aid to [[masturbation]]. More drastically, inflatable or rigid penile implants may be fitted surgically. Medications carry risk of [[priapism]].

All these mechanical methods are based on simple principles of hydraulics and mechanics and are quite reliable, but have their disadvantages.

===Medication===
;Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors
The cyclic nucleotide [[phosphodiesterase]]s constitute a group of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of the cyclic nucleotides cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP. They exist in different molecular forms and are unevenly distributed throughout the body.

One of the forms of phosphodiesterase is termed [[PDE5]]. The prescription [[PDE5 inhibitor]]s [[sildenafil]] (Viagra), [[vardenafil]] (Levitra) and [[tadalafil]] (Cialis) are prescription drugs which are taken orally.<ref>John P. Mulhall, M.D., ''Saving Your Sex Life: A Guide for Men with Prostate Cancer'', Chicago, Hilton Publishing Company, 2008</ref> They work by blocking the action of PDE5, which causes [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]] to degrade.

;Alprostadil
[[Alprostadil]] in combination with the permeation enhancer [[DDAIP]] has been approved in Canada under the brand name [[Vitaros]] as a topical cream first line treatment for erectile dysfunction.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bujdos|first=Brian|title=New Topical Erectile Dysfunction Drug Vitaros Approved in Canada; Approved Topical Drug Testim Proves Helpful for Erectile Dysfunction|url=http://www.accessrx.com/blog/current-health-news/vitaros-testim-topical-drugs-treat-erectile-dysfunction-a1115|accessdate=15 April 2011}}</ref>

Another treatment regimen is injection therapy.  One of the following drugs is injected into the penis: [[papaverine]], [[phentolamine]], and [[prostaglandin E1]].<ref>American vein and aesthetic institute, "Intra-Corporeal Injections For Erectile Dysfunction" http://www.medrehab.com/ICI_Impotence.php</ref>

===Surgery===
{{Main|Penile prosthesis}}
Often, as a last resort if other treatments have failed, the most common procedure is prosthetic implants which involves the insertion of artificial rods into the penis.<ref>[http://www.seekwellness.com/mensexuality/penimpl.htm Penile prostheses (implants)] Chris Steidle, MD, SeekWellness.com</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=May 2010}}

===Devices===
{{Main|penis pump}}
The device helps draw blood into the penis by applying negative pressure. This type of device is sometimes referred to as [[penis pump]] and may be used just prior to [[sexual intercourse]]. Several types of FDA approved vacuum therapy devices are available with a doctor's prescription.

===Alternative medicine===
The FDA does not recommend alternative therapies (ie. those that have not received FDA approval) to treat sexual dysfunction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/562177 |title=Dangers of Sexual Enhancement Supplements |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Many products are advertised as "[[herbal viagra]]" or "natural" sexual enhancement products, but no clinical trials or scientific studies support the effectiveness of these products for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, and synthetic chemical compounds similar to sildenafil have been found as [[adulterant]]s in many of these products.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gryniewicz | first1 = CM | last2 = Reepmeyer | first2 = JC | last3 = Kauffman | first3 = JF | last4 = Buhse | first4 = LF | title = Detection of undeclared erectile dysfunction drugs and analogues in dietary supplements by ion mobility spectrometry | journal = Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 601–6 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19150190 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpba.2008.12.002 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Choi, Dong Mi; Park, Sangaeh; Yoon, Tae Hyung; Jeong, Hye Kyoung; Pyo, Jae Sung; Park, Janghyun; Kim, Deukjoon; Kwon, Sung Won | title = Determination of analogs of sildenafil and vardenafil in foods by column liquid chromatography with a photodiode array detector, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry | journal = Journal of AOAC International | year = 2008 | volume = 91 | issue = 3 | pages = 580–588 | pmid = 18567304}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jpba.2007.04.011 | author = Reepmeyer, John C.; Woodruff, Jeffrey T.  | title = Use of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and a chemical cleavage reaction for the structure elucidation of a new sildenafil analogue detected as an adulterant in an herbal dietary supplement | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis | year = 2007 | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 887–893 | pmid = 17532168}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jpba.2006.11.037 | author = Reepmeyer, John C.; Woodruff, Jeffrey T.; 'Avignon, D.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
[[File:Zibik.jpg|thumb|200px|An unhappy wife is complaining to the [[Qadi]] about her husband's impotence. [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] miniature.]]
During the late 16th and 17th centuries in France, male impotence was considered a crime, as well as legal grounds for a divorce. The practice, which involved inspection of the complainants by court experts, was declared obscene in 1677.<ref>{{cite book|last=Roach|first=Mary|title=[[Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex]]|year=2009|publisher=W.W.

Dr. [[John R. Brinkley]] initiated a boom in male impotence cures in the US in the 1920s and 1930s. His radio programs recommended expensive goat gland implants and "mercurochrome" injections as the path to restored male virility, including operations by surgeon [[Serge Voronoff]].

Modern drug therapy for ED made a significant advance in 1983, when British physiologist [[Giles Brindley]], Ph.D. dropped his trousers and demonstrated to a shocked Urodynamics Society audience his [[papaverine]]-induced erection.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Klotz | first1 = L. | title = How (not) to communicate new scientific information: a memoir of the famous Brindley lecture | journal = BJU Int | volume = 96 | issue = 7 | pages = 956–7 | month = Nov | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2005.05797.x | pmid = 16225508 }}</ref> The drug Brindley injected into his penis was a non-specific vasodilator, an alpha-blocking agent, and the mechanism of action was clearly corporal smooth muscle relaxation.
