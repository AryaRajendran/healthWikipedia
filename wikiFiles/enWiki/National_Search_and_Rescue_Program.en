Combat support squadrons flying the Griffon are located at [[CFB Cold Lake]], [[CFB Bagotville]] and [[CFB Goose Bay]].  In 2005 [[424 Transport and Rescue Squadron]] at [[CFB Trenton]] re-equipped with the Griffon to replace its fleet of [[CH-149 Cormorant]]s as a primary SAR helicopter for central Canada.]]

The '''National Search and Rescue Program''' (NSP) is the name given by the [[Government of Canada]] to the collective [[search and rescue]] (SAR) activities in [[Canada]].  The NSP is administered by the [[National Search and Rescue Secretariat]] (NSS) and it provides for the coordination of public policy for the provision of SAR services.

The primary goal of the NSP is to save lives at risk throughout Canada's Search and Rescue Region of Responsibility (SRR); this includes all of Canada's land mass as well as areas of the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans as designated by the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) and [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO).  The NSP involves federal departments, provincial and territorial governments, municipalities, non-profit organizations, and volunteers working together to provide search and rescue in Canada.

==Organizational structure==
The Lead Minister for Search and Rescue (LMSAR) in the [[Government of Canada]] is the [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]].
Responsibilities are broken down within the federal government as follows:

;Operational SAR response

The [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] is the lead ministry responsible for providing and coordinating SAR response for incidents involving aircraft, and incidents involving vessels in federal or international waters.  This is accomplished through the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF), which operates 3 [[Rescue coordination centre|Joint Rescue Coordination Centres]] (JRCCs) as well as various dedicated SAR squadrons of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft.

The three JRCCs are:

* [[Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Halifax]] (JRCC Halifax)
* [[Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Trenton]] (JRCC Trenton)
* [[Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Victoria]] (JRCC Victoria)

The [[Department of Fisheries and Oceans (Canada)|Department of Fisheries and Oceans]], through the [[Canadian Coast Guard]] (CCG), is tasked with responding to emergencies involving vessels that occur in waters of federal responsibility (all navigable ocean waters on Canada's Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic coasts, plus the [[Great Lakes]], [[St. Lawrence River]], and portions of connecting waterways).  CCG personnel, in coordination with RCAF personnel, also staff the 3 JRCCs and CCG exclusively staffs a [[Rescue coordination centre|Maritime Rescue Sub-Centre]] (MRSC): [[Maritime Rescue Sub-Centre Quebec]]. There was also an MRSC located in St. John's, Newfoundland until it was closed for budget cuts in early 2012.

;Regulatory SAR policy

The [[National Search and Rescue Secretariat]] (NSS) is an independent agency of the federal government, reporting to the LMSAR, and supports and promotes the activities of the National SAR Program (NSP) as a means to achieve highly effective and economically responsible search and rescue programs throughout Canada.  The NSS was established as a national coordinating authority for SAR policy in Canada; this was one of the key recommendations resulting from the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the ''[[Ocean Ranger]]'' disaster.

The [[Transport Canada|Department of Transport]], through its civil aviation and marine safety programs, plays a supporting role to the NSP by working to prevent air and marine transport incidents requiring a search and rescue response. This is accomplished through policies relating to regulations, inspections, enforcement, and safety promotion functions.

==Air SAR resources==
Air resources for responding to search and rescue incidents in Canada are coordinated by, and often supplied by, the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF).  Due to their rapid response, air resources are often the first equipment tasked to respond in remote inland, coastal or offshore locations, regardless of whether it is for an aircraft or marine incident.

*  The RCAF provides all primary air resources for responding to an air or marine SAR incident.  RCAF squadrons dedicated to SAR operations are stationed at [[CFB Gander]], [[CFB Greenwood]], [[CFB Trenton]], [[CFB Winnipeg]], and [[CFB Comox]].  Combat support squadrons are also located at [[CFB Cold Lake]], [[CFB Bagotville]], and [[CFB Goose Bay]].

*  Other aircraft operated by other federal government departments and agencies such as the RCMP, Department of Transport, or the Department of Fisheries and Oceans may be requested as secondary air resources by the RCAF.

*  The [[Civil Air Search and Rescue Association]] (CASARA) supplies civilian aircraft flown by volunteer pilot owners in support of the RCAF's SAR operations upon the request of the RCAF.

*  Under ICAO conventions, any aircraft of opportunity that may be transiting the search area may be requested by the RCAF to participate in the search, provided the aircraft of opportunity is able to.

==Marine SAR resources==
Marine resources for responding to search and rescue incidents in Canada are coordinated by, and often supplied by, the [[Canadian Coast Guard]] (CCG).  Marine resources are most often tasked to respond to a marine incident in waters of federal jurisdiction, however, they can also be tasked to respond to incidents involving an aircraft if that should also occur in waters of federal jurisdiction.

*  The CCG provides all primary marine resources for responding to SAR incidents in waters of federal jurisdiction.  This includes dedicated SAR vessels stationed at strategic locations as well as the rest of the CCG fleet.

*  Other vessels operated by other federal government departments and agencies such as the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] (RCN) or RCMP may be requested as secondary marine resources by the CCG.

*  The [[Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary]] (CCGA) supplies civilian vessels sailed by volunteer owners in support of the CCG's SAR operations upon the request of the CCG.

*  Under IMO conventions, any vessel of opportunity that may be transiting the search area may be requested by the CCG to participate in the search, provided the vessel of opportunity is able to.

==Parks Canada SAR resources==
Within Canada's [[national park]]s, SAR resources and operations are supplied and coordinated by [[Parks Canada]].  This also includes [[national marine conservation area]]s, [[national park reserve]]s, [[National Historic Sites of Canada|national historic site]]s, and [[national historic canal]]s.  In larger national parks that see a high degree of visitor usage, or have unique dangers for park visitors (e.g. ocean waters, mountains, back country, etc.), Parks Canada supplies its own dedicated SAR resources in the form of specialized staff and equipment. Parks Canada often requests support from other federal resources, including the RCAF, CCG, [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) as well as provincial/territorial or municipal resources, depending on the location of the incident.

==Ground and inland water SAR resources==
In areas of provincial or territorial jurisdiction (e.g. on land or in inland lakes and rivers that are non-federal waters), SAR resources are coordinated by provincial or territorial governments.  Response to, and the coordination and supply of resources to, a ground or inland  water SAR incident in a province or territory is the responsibility of the provincial or territorial police agency (or a municipal police agency).  That police agency, in coordination with the provincial or territorial (or municipal) government, may request federal resources to assist in responding to a ground or inland water SAR incident.  This is often in the form of RCAF or CASARA aircraft and occasionally in the form of CCG or CCGA vessels (usually trailer deployed small craft).  These requests are coordinated through inter-government agreements.

All provinces and territories have volunteer ground search and rescue (GSAR) organizations that assist the responding police agency by providing the large amount of manpower necessary for a ground search, as well as specialized expertise, equipment, and local knowledge.  The [http://www.sarvac.ca Search and Rescue Volunteer Association of Canada (SARVAC)] is the national body representing ground and inland water SAR volunteers in Canada.
