'''Interstitial Keratitis''' (IK) basically means [[corneal]] [[scarring]] due to [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[inflammation]] of the [[corneal stroma]]. Interstitial means space between [[Cell (biology)|cells]] i.e. [[corneal stroma]] which lies between the [[epithelium]] and the [[endothelium]]. [[Keratitis]] means corneal inflammation.

==Pathophysiology==

The corneal scarring is the end result of the initial invasion of [[blood vessels]] into the corneal stroma as part of the inflammatory response. Since normal corneal tissue should be avascular (no blood vessel) and therefore clear to allow light to pass, the presence of blood vessel and the infiltration of cells as part of the inflammatory process results in scarring or hazing of the cornea.<ref>Dr Khairul Nazri Mohammad (Articles' Author), Waterford General Hospital, IRELAND</ref>

==Aetiology==

By far the most common cause of IK is [[syphilitic]] disease. However, there are two possible causes of the corneal inflammatory response: an infection and/or an immunological response, such as a [[hypersensitivity]] type reaction, or (rarely) Cogan syndrome.<ref name=Cogan>{{cite web|last=Ramachandran|first=Tarakad|title=Cogan Syndrome|url=http://www.medlink.com/CIP.ASP=MLT000PJ|work=Medlink|publisher=MedLink Corporation|accessdate=1/11/2012}}</ref> Infectious causes include syphilis (commonest), followed by other bacterial infections ([[Tuberculosis|TB]], [[Leprosy]] and [[Lyme disease]]) and parasitic infections ([[Acanthamoeba]], [[Onchocerciasis]] or [[river blindness]], [[Leishmaniasis]], [[Trypanosoma cruzi]] or ''[[Chagas disease]]'', [[Trypanosoma brucei]] or ''[[African trypanosomiasis|African sleeping sickness]]'' and microsporidia)<ref>Majmudar PA.

==History==

Previous long-standing eye infection which possibly during childhood time recalled as being treated with antibiotic and/or hospitalized over long period of time.

==Symptoms and signs==

Acutely or at the early sign includes painful, [[photophobic]], red and watery eye. This is due to active corneal inflammation resulting in vascular invasion and stromal [[necrosis]] which can be diffuse or localized. This cause the pinkish discoloration of what was a clear transparent normal corneal tissue (called ''[[Salmon patch of Hutchinson]]'').

Chronically or the end result will cause blurring of vision secondary to corneal stromal scarring, presence of ghost vessel and thinning of the cornea especially if it involves the [[visual axis]].

==Treatment==

The underlying cause must be treated as soon as possible to stop the disease process. [[Corticosteroid]] drop can be used to minimize the scarring on the cornea along with [[antibiotic]] cover. However, residual scarring cannot be avoided which can result in long term visual impairment and corneal transplantation is not suitable due to high rejection rate from the corneal vascularization.<ref>Kanski JJ.
