'''Angiokeratoma''' a is benign [[cutaneous]] lesion of capillaries, resulting in small marks of red to blue color and characterized by [[hyperkeratosis]]. ''Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum'' refers to [[Fabry's disease]],<ref name="pmid16988295">{{cite journal |author=Trickett R, Dowd H |title=Angiokeratoma of the scrotum: a case of scrotal bleeding |journal=Emerg Med J |volume=23 |issue=10 |pages=e57 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=16988295 |doi=10.1136/emj.2006.038745 |url=http://emj.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16988295 |pmc=2579622}}</ref> but this is usually considered a distinct condition.

==Possible misdiagnosis==
Due to the rarity of different types of vascular conditions, angiokeratomas may be misdiagnosed.  A [[biopsy]] of the lesion can produce a more accurate diagnosis.

===Histopathology===
Angiokeratomas characteristically have large dilated [[blood vessel]]s in the superficial [[dermis]] and [[hyperkeratosis]] (overlying the dilated vessels).

==Potential complications==
In some instances nodular angiokeratomas can produce necrotic tissue and valleys that can harbor fungal, bacterial and viral infections.  Infections can include staphylococcus.  If the lesion becomes painful, begins draining fluids or pus, or begins to smell, consult a physician.  In these instance a doctor may recommend excision and grafting.

==Treatment== 
Outpatient treatments such as interventional radiology, lasers, and physical therapy are employed to reduce the severity of the vascular lesions.  However, in some cases lasers have caused a reaction in the tissue causing it to expand and become exposed to infection.  Excision and grafting may be necessary to remove the lesion.  Recovery time on such an operation ranges from 3 to 12 weeks depending on location of the graft, healing time and the possibility of complications.
