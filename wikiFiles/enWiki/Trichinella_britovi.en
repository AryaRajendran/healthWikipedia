'''''Trichinella britovi''''' is a [[nematode]] [[parasite]] responsible for a [[zoonosis|zoonotic disease]] called [[trichinellosis]]. There are currently eight known species of ''Trichinella''.<ref name="Mowlavi">Mowlavi, G., Marucci, G., Mobedi, I., Zahabiioon, F., Mirjalali, H., Pozio, E., ''Trichinella britovi'' in a leopard (''Panthera pardus saxicolor'') in Iran. Veterinary Parasitology. 2009. 164:350–352</ref> Only three of the ''Trichinella'' species cause trichinellosis, and ''Trichinella britovi'' is one of them.<ref name="wildBoar">Gari-Toussaint, M., Tieulié, N., Baldin, J.L, Dupouy-Camet, J., Delaunay, P., Fuzibet, J.G., , Fichoux, Y. L., Pozio, E., Marty, P. Human trichinellosis due to ''Trichinella britovi'' in Southern France after consumption of wild boar meat. Eurosurveillance. 2005; 10(6): 117–118</ref> Numerous mammal species as well as birds and crocodiles<ref name="Mowlavi" /><ref name="wildBoar" /> can harbor the parasite worldwide, but the [[sylvatic cycle]] is mainly maintained by wild carnivores.<ref name="wildBoar" />

Humans represent only a possible [[Host (biology)|host]] and the parasite is exclusively transmitted through consumption of raw or [[Temperature (meat)|rare]] meat.<ref name="wildBoar" /> In Europe, [[pork]], [[wild boar]] meat and [[horse meat]] are the main sources for human infection.<ref name="wildBoar" />

Because of mandatory veterinary controls in [[slaughterhouse]]s, large trichinellosis outbreaks due to horse meat consumption are rare, but cases in hunters and their families after raw or rare wild boar meat consumption are regularly reported, with over one hundred cases since 1975.<ref>Dupoy-Camet J. Ancelle T. Zoonoses parasitaires transmises par la chair animale en France. La Lettre de l'Infectiologue. 2002; XVII (5): 143–148</ref>

''T. britovi'' in wild boar is relatively resistant to freezing. It was observed in France that meat from naturally infected wild boar meat frozen for three weeks at {{convert|−20|°C|0}} remained infectious, whereas they were not viable after four weeks.<ref>Pozio E.

In the 1960s, ''trichinella infection'' was documented in [[Senegal]], [[West Africa]]. A survey of 160 wild animals from that region produced plausible evidence that European strains may have originated in Africa. It has also been proposed that strains of ''Trichella britovi'' are isolated to both African and European populations.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=17007233|title=''Trichinella britovi'' etiological agent of sylvatic trichinellosis in the Republic of Guinea (West Africa) and a re-evaluation of geographical distribution for encapsulated species in Africa|last=Pozio |first=E.|coauthors=Pagani P., Marucci G., Zarlenga D.

==Prevention==
To prevent trichinellosis, an official European directive<ref>Council Directive 77/96/EEC of 21 December 1976 on the examination for trichinae (''Trichinella spiralis'') upon importation from third countries of fresh meat derived from domestic swine. O.J. No L26 of 31.1.1977, p. 67.</ref> recommends the freezing of meat at {{convert|−25|°C|0}} for at least 10 days for pieces of meat less than {{convert|25|cm|abbr=on|0}} thickness. Patients froze wild boar steaks at {{convert|−35|°C|0}} for seven days, but this freezing time appears insufficient to kill larvae, since ''T.&nbsp;britovi'' is a species relatively resistant to freezing.<ref>Pozio E, Zarlenga DS. Recent advances on the taxonomy, systematics and epidemiology of Trichinella. International Journal for Parasitology. In Press.</ref>

Thus according to the International Commission on Trichinellosis, meat should be heated at {{convert|65|°C|0}} for at least 1 minute to kill ''Trichinella'' larvae; larvae die when the color of the meat at the core changes from pink to brown.<ref>Gamble HR, Bessonov AS, Cuperlovic, K, Gajadhar AA, van Knapen F, Noeckler, K, Schenone H, Zhu, X.
