'''Sleep sex''', or '''sexsomnia''', is a condition in which a person will engage in sexual acts while still asleep. This condition falls within the broad classes of sleep disorders known as [[parasomnia]]. Sexsomnia includes<ref>.http://www.springerlink.com/content/ckx0l197986l3ux6/</ref> [[fondling]], heterosexual and homosexual intercourse, [[masturbation]], and [[oral sex]]. In extreme cases sexsomnia has even been alleged as the cause of rare instances of [[sexual assault]] and [[rape]].<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20340562</ref><ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-20758315</ref>
The proposed medical diagnosis is NREM Arousal Parasomnia – Sexual Behaviour in Sleep. Sexsomnia is considered a type of [[non-rapid eye movement sleep]] (NREM) [[parasomnia]]. Sexsomniacs do not remember the acts that they perform while they are asleep.
Sexsomnia can co-occur alongside other sleep disorders such as [[sleepwalking]], [[sleep apnea]], [[night terrors]] and [[bedwetting]] and can be triggered by stress, previous [[sleep deprivation]] and excessive consumption of alcohol or drugs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sexsomnia |publisher=Sleep.com |url=http://www.sleep.com/content/sexsomnia}}</ref><ref name="psychologytoday">{{cite news |title=Sexsomnia |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sleepless-in-america/200902/sexsomnia |work=Psychology Today |year=2009 }}</ref> Sleep related epilepsy may be associated with [[sexual arousal]], pelvic thrusting and orgasms, though in these sorts of cases the acts are often not remembered.<ref name="psychologytoday" /> Sexsomnia episodes could be triggered by physical contact with a bed partner.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Trajanovic NN, Mangan M, Shapiro CM |title=Sexual behaviour in sleep: an internet survey |journal=Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=1024–31 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=17932612 |doi=10.1007/s00127-007-0258-0}}</ref>
Sexsomnia which is a fairly new medically recognized behaviour has been used in criminal defense cases of rape.<ref name="psychologytoday" /><ref name=Salkeld>{{cite news |author=Salkeld, Luke |title="Sexomniac" RAF Man Sobs as he is Cleared of Raping a Girl in his Sleep |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-473525/Sexsomniac-RAF-man-sobs-cleared-raping-girl-sleep.html |work=Daily Mail |location=London |date=7 August 2007 }}</ref>  There have also been several cases of sexsomnia which have appeared in the news and also in pop culture as reality shows, movies etc.

== History of sleep sex ==
The first research paper that suggested that sexual behavior during sleep may be a new type of parasomnia was published in 1996 by three researchers from the [[University of Toronto]] (Colin Shapiro and Nik Trajanovic) and the [[University of Ottawa]] (Paul Fedoroff).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shapiro CM, Fedoroff JP, Trajanovic NN |title=Sexual behavior in sleep: a newly described parasomnia |journal=Sleep Research |volume=25 |pages=367 |year=1996 |url=http://www.websciences.org/cftemplate/NAPS/archives/indiv.cfm?ID=19960381}}</ref>  The term "sleepsex" was used in a 1998 case report by David Saul Rosenfeld, a neurologist and sleep specialist from Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=9604116 | volume=27 | issue=3 | title=Sleepsex: a variant of sleepwalking | year=1998 | month=June | author=Rosenfeld DS, Elhajjar AJ | journal=Arch Sex Behav | pages=269–78}}</ref>  The term 'sexsomnia' was coined by Colin Shapiro in a case report published in June 2003.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Sexsomnia – A New Parasomnia? |author=Shapiro CM, Trajanovic NN, Fedoroff JP |pmid=12866336 |journal=[[Canadian Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=48 |issue=5 |year=2003 |month=June |pages=311–7}}</ref>

==The psychology of sexsomnia==
Sleep sex may accompany relationship difficulties and feelings of embarrassment.<ref name="sleepsex.org" /> Often the actions of the person who has sexsomnia are reported by his or her partner as the sexsomniacs are unaware of the event.<ref name="sleepsex.org" /[[Polysomnography]].<ref name="sleepsex.org">[http://www.sleepsex.org/ Sexual behavior in sleep ] Retrieved on 3 March 2010</ref>

[[Clonazepam]] has been used as a first line of treatment for this condition,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shapiro CM, Trajanovic NN, Fedoroff JP |title=Sexsomnia—a new parasomnia? |journal=Can J Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=311–7 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12866336 |url=http://ww1.cpa-apc.org:8080/Publications/Archives/CJP/2003/june/shapiro.asp}}</ref><ref>A patient treated with clonazepam was featured on the television documentary ''[[Strange Sex]]'' that aired on TLC 27 January 2010</ref> when other measures are not enough to solve a case of sexsomnia.

==Pop Culture==
Sexsomnia, although unknown to much of the population, is evidently present in much of daily pop culture. The [[medical drama]] television series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' included an episode dealing with sexsomnia in its first season, [[Role Model (House)|"Role Model"]], in which a woman who claimed she was not sexually active mysteriously became pregnant and found hickeys and other marks on her body. The titular character, Doctor House, eventually diagnosed the woman as a sexsomniac, explaining her strange situation. The condition has also been featured in episodes of many other television shows such as ''[[Law and Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' [[List of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episodes#Season 9: 2007–08|season 9]], episode #2 "Avatar", and ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' [[List of Desperate Housewives episodes#Season 7: 2010–2011|Season seven]], episode #2, " You Must Meet My Wife". It has also been a theme in novels and plays. In [[Ralph Ellison]]'s novel ''[[Invisible Man (novel)|Invisible Man]],'' a farmer claims to have had sex with his daughter while asleep. In the play ''Yakish and Popcha'' by [[Hanoch Levin]], Yakish only manages to have intercourse with his wife Popcha while both are asleep, by the end of the play.
