'''The Seattle & King County Emergency Medical Services System''' is a fire-based two-tier response system providing prehospital basic and advanced life support services.

There are six paramedic provider programs in the system. The Seattle Fire Department operates Seattle Medic One. The program is funded by the city's general fund and has a different administrative structure than the five other Medic One programs.<ref>EMS Division 2002, 2002 Strategic Plan Update pg. 53</ref> The five other Medic One programs with the exception of King County Medic One are operated by fire departments under a formal contract with the EMS Division of [[Public Health - Seattle & King County]].<ref>EMS Division 2002, 2002 Strategic Plan Update pg. 24</ref> King County Medic One is directly operated by the EMS Division. 

The modern EMS system in King County began operation in 1970 with 15 paramedics staffing one [[paramedic]] unit in Seattle. In 2009 there are 255 paramedics<ref name="number of paramedics">[http://depts.washington.edu/survive/local-action.php The local action plan to improve community cardiac arrest survival], section 7</ref> from six paramedic programs staffing 26 paramedic units.<ref name="seattle fire personnel apparatus profile">Seattle Fire Department 2008, pg. 2</ref><ref name="ems division 2009 pg 75">EMS Division 2009, pg. 75</ref>

The system is a dynamic layered response system. An EMS response to an emergency begins with a telephone call to [[9-1-1]]. Calls are transferred from a primary call taker to [[emergency medical dispatcher|emergency medical call taker]] who gathers information from the caller, gives instructions to the caller, and determines what types of emergency personnel to send. For very serious and life threatening emergencies [[firefighter]]s trained in [[basic life support]] and paramedics trained in [[advanced life support]] respond simultaneously. Paramedics transport patients in critical condition. For less severe emergencies only firefighters will be dispatched. Basic life support personnel from either a fire department or private ambulance company transport non-critical patients. <!--In 2008 paramedics were dispatched 29% of the time. The system is designed to have a few paramedics performing many advanced skills.-->

==History==

[[Image:seattle fire department medic 80.jpg|thumb|Seattle Paramedic Unit]]
[[Image:King County Medic 4.jpg|thumb|King County Paramedic Unit]]

In 1968, motivated by the work of [[Frank Pantridge]] cardiologist [[Leonard Cobb]] proposed to the chief of the [[Seattle Fire Department]], [[Gordon Vickery]], training firefighters to treat cardiac arrest. The department was attractive to Cobb because it already provided first aid and tracked its performance electronically.<ref>Cardiac Arrest: The Science and Practice of Resuscitation Medicine, pg. 20</ref>

In 1969, they trained fifteen firefighters and used a grant from the Washington/Alaska Regional Medical Program to convert a large [[Recreational vehicle|motor home]] into a Mobile Coronary Care Unit (nicknamed “Moby Pig”) which would respond to calls with both the firefighter paramedics and a physician on board.

The first Medic One call was on March 7, 1970 and during the program's first year, 31 lives were saved.<ref name ="USA Today">{{cite news |last=Davis |first=Robert |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/ems-day1-seattle.htm |title=Seattle: Firefighters, medics unite to save lives |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=2005-05-20 |accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>  The following year the program was changed, replacing the on-board doctors with fire department paramedics given advanced special training and remote access to the doctors.

In 1974, TV news-magazine, ''[[60 Minutes]]'', profiled the success of Medic One, lauding the high standards of training and education provided by the Seattle training program.  [[Correspondent]] [[Morley Safer]] declared, “If you have to have a heart attack, have it in Seattle.” A phrase still used frequently in conjunction with Medic One, due to its continued success which is reflected in the area's high survival rate for heart attacks and their comprehensive CPR training program.<ref name="DYK">{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.mediconefoundation.org/facts/did-you-know.htm |title=Medic One Facts – Did You Know|publisher=Medic One Foundation |date= |accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref><ref name="KC"/>

That same year Medic One [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] as a privately held, [[non-profit organization]] and established the Medic One Foundation, which works on behalf of both fund raising and the expansion of the program. The program is financed by local property tax levies, which are voted on by the public every six years, along with private and corporate donations.<ref name="KC">{{cite news|last=|first=|url=http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/ems/MedicOne.aspx|title=King County Medic One|publisher=Public Health Seattle & King County|date=|accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>

Medic One service was expanded throughout King County in 1976<ref>Belew, Ellie 2004, pg. 78 - 79 [http://www.iaff2595.org/?zone=/unionactive/view_page.cfm&page=History20of20Local202595 History of Local 2595]</ref> and, at that time, had been credited with saving the lives of 655 people who were clinically dead at the time paramedics arrived on scene. As the program's reputation grew, other counties in Washington State began adopting their own Medic One programs in conjunction with the Medic One Foundation.

In 1979, the program further evolved when Cobb worked with UW professor Mickey Eisenberg to start the training of fire department [[emergency medical technician - basic]]s to administer [[defibrillation]] treatment, as these EMTs are first on the scene, often arriving prior to the paramedics by several minutes. In 1982 a program was launched training 9-1-1 dispatchers to provide CPR instructions over the phone. The advent of automatic heart defibrillators in 1984 made it even easier for EMTs to treat heart attack victims.<ref name="UW">{{cite news|last=|first=|url=http://www.washington.edu/research/pathbreakers/1970a.html|title=1970 Medic One |publisher=University of Washington Department of Research|date=1996-09-01|accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>

[[King County Medic One]] is the paramedic service serving all of [[South King County]] provided by [[Public Health - Seattle & King County]].<ref name="ems division 11"/> Its medical director is [[Tom Rea]].
<br clear="all" />

==Structure==

Founded on strong physician leadership Medic One is structured around [[Emergency management|response]], [[training]], and [[quality improvement]].

One of the primary components to the success of Medic One is their “Tiered Response System” which begins with the citizen call to the 9-1-1 center. Emergency Medical Dispatchers are trained to rapidly triage the call to dispatch the appropriate level of assistance, while providing pre-arrival instruction of CPR. Firefighters, with EMT training, respond first to deliver immediate Basic Life Support (BLS), pending the arrival of the paramedics. Specially trained paramedics arrive within minutes to provide Advanced Life Support (ALS) and, if needed, can provide transportation to the nearest appropriate Medical Center.<ref name="Strategic Plan">{{cite news|last=|first=|url=http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/ems/~/media/health/publichealth/documents/ems/Strategic_Plan_2008_2013.ashx |title=Medic One/Emergency Medical Services – 2008-2013 Strategic Plan |publisher=Public Health Seattle & King County|date=2007-01-01|accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>

The system is successful due to the blended cooperation between the fire department and paramedic/ambulance services, as well as, a strict policy of meticulous measurement of system performance and cardiac arrest survival information. Strong leadership and regional programs promote uniformity in medical care and response, regardless of jurisdiction.<ref name ="USA Today"/>

Another critical element to the Medic One program is the comprehensive training program for the paramedics, one of the most stringent anywhere, making their paramedics some of the most thoroughly trained in the world. Only paramedics with at least three years of prior firefighter or EMT experience may enter the program. Medic One paramedics receive 2,000 hours of instruction, using both “book” studies and hands on field and clinical application through both the University of Washington and Harborview Medical Center. The national standard for paramedic training is just 1,100 hours. Medic One paramedics will have more than 700 patient contacts during their training, which is three times the national standard. Upon completion of training Medic One paramedics are considered to be an extension of the ER doctors and may perform advanced medical care, open airways and administer a variety of medications<ref name="DYK"/>

The final component is an emphasis on community based CPR training, called Medic Two. The Seattle/[[King County, Washington|King County]] area has the highest per capita number of citizens that are trained in the administration of CPR techniques, approximately 50% of its residents.<ref name="QPR">{{cite news|last=|first=|url=http://www.qprinstitute.com/Whatis.htm|title=In One Hour You Can Become a Gatekeeper |publisher=QPR Institute|year=1999|accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>

===Leadership===

Medic One is operated as a partnership between physicians and administrators. Medical directors review patient care by paramedics and can make recommendations including decertification and termination. Administrators act upon the recommendations of the medical director.<ref>Eisenberg 2009, pg. 123</ref>

===Response===

The major components of Medic One's response system are universal access, dispatcher triage, basic life support services, advanced life support services, and transport to hospitals.<ref name="EMS Division 2009 pg 9"/>

A medical [[9-1-1]] call is handled by one of the following communication centers [[Seattle Fire Department Alarm Center]], [[Valley Communications Center]], [[North East King County Regional Public Safety Communication Agency]], [[Port of Seattle Police Department Communications Center]], or [[Enumclaw Police Department Communications Center]]. 

Medic One dispatchers use [[criteria based dispatch]] guidelines to send the most appropriate care providers. The three response levels are basic with advanced life support units, emergency BLS only, and non-emergency BLS only.<ref>[http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/ems/community/~/media/health/publichealth/documents/ems/cbdarticle.ashx Criteria Based Dispatch: Improving Emergency Medical Dispatching]</ref>

The first tier is [[basic life support]] provided by cross-trained firefighter [[emergency medical technician - basic]]s.

The second tier is [[advanced life support]].

Basic life support transports for 9-1-1 calls are provided by either a fire department or one of the private ambulance companies [[American Medical Response]] and [[Tri-Med Ambulance]]. Advanced life support transports for 9-1-1 calls are provided by paramedics.

===Education===

[[Image:Uw paramedic training program hours.png|thumb|Break down of training<ref>http://www.hecb.wa.gov/autheval/dpr/documents/UWBofParamedWEB.pdf</ref>]]

All paramedics in King County are graduates of the [[University of Washington Paramedic Training Program]] regardless of previous training. The training is 1,866 total hours consisting of 380 lecture hours, 120 lab hours, 466 clinical hours in the [[operating room]] and [[emergency department]] at [[Harborview Medical Center]] and [[critical care unit]] and [[labor and delivery]] at [[Seattle Children's|Seattle Children's Hospital]], and 900 field internship hours with [[Seattle Medic One]].<ref>Seattle Channel, minute 33:18</ref> Students see an average of 700 patient contacts.

===Improvement===

The paramedic medical director for the one of six Medic One programs that provided care reviews every resuscitation, intubation, and central-line placement attempt. That director provides both positive and negative feedback. For probationary paramedics a more rigorous review is conducted.<ref name="Eisenberg 2009, pg. 129"/>

==Funding==

Medic One paramedic programs are funded by a property tax levy. Basic life support services receive partial funding from the levy. The levy passed in 1979, 1985, 1991, 1998, 2001, and 2008.<ref>EMS Division 2008, Strategic Plan pg. 11</ref> The levy did not pass in 1997.<ref>EMS Division 2008, Strategic Plan pg. 12</ref>

The Medic One Foundation is a nonprofit charitable foundation supporting paramedic training, research, medical oversight and quality review, and the purchasing of emergency medical equipment.<ref>Medic One Foundation, [http://www.mediconefoundation.org/docs/2006-07_Financial_Highlights.pdf 2006-07 Financial Highlights]</ref>

==Performance==

===Cardiac Arrest===

A change in the protocol of emergency response personnel is also credited as contributing to the high survival rate in the region. Guidelines set by the American Heart Association in 2000, recommend repeated shocks from a defibrillator and to check for a pulse prior to starting CPR. Medic One guidelines, established in 2005, are to provide a single shock from a defibrillator followed immediately by two minutes of CPR, beginning with chest compressions. This has dropped the average time between first shock to starting CPR from twenty-eight seconds to seven seconds, resulting in a near 50% increase in the previous rate of survival. For every one-hundred cardiac arrest calls, now an additional thirteen patients will live.<ref name="SPI">{{cite news |last=Black |first=Cherie |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/health/295585_cpr12.html   |title=SCounty boosts cardiac survival rate - Reason may be a new resuscitation method used by emergency crews |publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=2006-12-12 |accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>

In King County outcomes of attempted out-of-hospital resuscitations are recorded, following the [[Utstein Style|Utstein uniform reporting guidelines]], in a cardiac arrest registry. In 2008 Medic One's survival rate for witnessed cardiac arrests due to heart disease prior to EMS arrival with initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia was 49%.<ref name="ems division 2009 pg 70"/>
