'''Doctor of Chiropractic''' (D.C.) is a  [[degree]] of [[chiropractic]] for chiropractors in [[North America]]. Chiropractors practice chiropractic medicine, a health care profession concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disorders of the neuromusculoskeletal system and the effects of these disorders on general health.<ref name=WHO-guidelines/> Chiropractors emphasize [[manual therapy|manual and manipulative therapy]] for the treatment of [[joint dysfunction]]s.  Chiropractic is generally classified as [[complementary/alternative medicine]].<ref name=Chapman-Smith/>

In some countries it is a [[professional doctorate]]  where training is entered after obtaining between 90 and 120 credit hours of university level work (see [[second entry degree]]) and in most cases after obtaining a Bachelors Degree.  The World Health Organization lists three potential educational paths involving full‐time chiropractic education across the globe. This includes: 1 – 4 years of pre-requisite training in basic sciences at university level followed by a 4 year full‐time Doctorate program; DC. A 5 year integrated [[bachelor degree]]; BSc (Chiro).  A  2 - 3 year [[Masters degree]] following the completion of a bachelor degree leads to the MSc (Chiro).<ref name=WHO-guidelines/> In South Africa the Masters of Technology in Chiropractic (M.Tech Chiro) is granted following 6 years of university. No less than 4200 student/teacher contact hours (or the equivalent) in four years of full‐time education. This includes a minimum of 1000 hours of supervised clinical training.<ref name=WHO-guidelines>{{cite journal |author= World Health Organization |year=2005 |title= WHO guidelines on basic training and safety in chiropractic |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/Chiro-Guidelines.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-03-03}}</ref> Health professionals with advanced clinical degrees, such as medical doctors, can meet the educational and clinical requirements to practice as a chiropractor in 2200 hours, which is most commonly done in countries where the profession is in its infancy.<ref name=WHO>http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/Chiro-Guidelines.pdf</ref> 

Upon meeting all clinical and didactic requirements of chiropractic school, a degree in chiropractic medicine is granted. However, in order to practice, chiropractors must be [[licensed]].

==Training==

{{Main|Chiropractic education|List of chiropractic schools}}
Regardless of the model of education utilized, prospective chiropractors without relevant prior health care education or experience, must spend no less than 4200 student/teacher contact hours (or the equivalent) in four years of full‐time education. This includes a minimum of 1000 hours of supervised clinical training.<ref name=WHO-guidelines>{{cite journal |author= World Health Organization |year=2005 |title= WHO guidelines on basic training and safety in chiropractic |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/Chiro-Guidelines.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-03-03}}</ref> Health professionals with advanced clinical degrees, such as medical doctors, can meet the educational and clinical requirements to practice as a chiropractor in 2200 hours, which is most commonly done in countries where the profession is in its infancy.<ref name=WHO /> Upon meeting all clinical and didactic requirements of chiropractic school, a degree in chiropractic medicine is granted. However, in order to legally practice, chiropractors, like all [[regulated|self regulated]] health care professionals, must be [[licensed]].  All Chiropractic Examining Boards require candidates to complete a 12 month clinical internship to obtain licensure. Licensure is granted following successful completion of all state/provincial and national board exams so long as the chiropractor maintains [[malpractice]] insurance. Nonetheless, there are still some variations in educational standards internationally, depending on admission and graduation requirements. Chiropractic medicine is regulated in North America by state/provincial [[statute]]. The regulatory boards are responsible for protecting the public, standards of practice, disciplinary issues, quality assurance and maintenance of competency.<ref>[http://www.ccachiro.org/Client/cca/cca.nsf/web/Facts%20%26%20FAQs?OpenDocument Facts & FAQs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Regulation and accreditation==
{{main|Councils on Chiropractic Education International}}
Regulations for chiropractic practice vary considerably from country to country. In some countries, such as. the United States of America, Canada and some European countries, chiropractic has been legally recognized and formal university degrees have been established. In these countries, the profession is regulated and the prescribed
educational qualifications are generally consistent, satisfying the requirements of the respective accrediting agencies.  However, many countries have not yet developed chiropractic education or established laws to regulate the qualified practice of chiropractic. In addition, in some countries, other qualified health professionals and lay practitioners may use techniques of spinal manipulation and claim to provide chiropractic services, although they may not have received chiropractic training in an accredited programme.

Chiropractic is governed internationally by the Councils on Chiropractic Education International (CCEI).  This body is officially recognized by the [[World Federation of Chiropractic]] and the [[World Health Organization]] as the accrediting agency for schools of chiropractic across the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Basic training and safety in chiropractic|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/m/abstract/Js14076e/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref>  
The minimum prerequisite for enrollment in a chiropractic college set forth by the CCEI is 90 semester hours, and the minimum cumulative GPA for a student entering is 3.0 on a 4.0 scale.[http://www.cce-usa.org/] Common prerequisite classes include those of the biological, chemical, & physical sciences, including: [[human anatomy]] and [[human physiology|physiology]], [[embryology]], [[genetics]], [[microbiology]], [[immunology]], [[cellular biology]], [[exercise physiology]], [[kinesiology]], [[general chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[analytical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], [[pharmacology|toxicology/pharmacology]], [[nutrition]], [[nuclear medicine]], [[physics]], [[biomechanics]], and [[statistics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmer.edu/PrerequisitesDC/ |title=Admissions Requirements - D.C |publisher=Palmer.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}</ref> Chiropractic programs require at least 4,200 hours of combined classroom, laboratory, and clinical experience.

===Australia===
In Australia, a minimum of five-years worth of chiropractic education is needed before one may register as a practicing chiropractor. Chiropractic is taught at four public universities: [[RMIT University|RMIT]] in Melbourne, [[Murdoch University]] in Perth, [[Macquarie University]] in Sydney and new in 2012 [[Central Queensland University]] in Mackay. The RMIT, UCQ and Macquarie programs graduate chiropractors with a bachelors degree followed by a masters degree while Murdoch University graduates attain a double bachelors degree, any of which is necessary for registration with state registration boards.<ref name="autogenerated3">[http://www.ccea.com.au/Program%20Accreditation/Programs.htm ]{{dead link|date=September 2012}}</ref>

A graduate of RMIT will have attained a Bachelor of Applied Science (Chiropractic) and a Master of Clinical Chiropractic.<ref>[http://www.rmit.edu.au/programs/bp187 RMIT Chiropractic]</ref> Similarly, a typical graduate of Macquarie University will have a Bachelor of Chiropractic Science followed by a Master of Chiropractic.<ref>[http://www.chiro.mq.edu.au/aboutus/Chiropractic.htm Macquarie University Department of Chiropractic]</ref> Murdoch University graduates possess the double-degree of Bachelor of Science (Chiropractic Science) / Bachelor of Chiropractic.<ref>[http://www.chiropractic.murdoch.edu.au/course_details.html Murdoch University Chiropractic]</ref> Students at University of Central Queensland graduate with a Bachelor of Science (Chiropractic) followed by a Master of Chiropractic Science.<ref>[http://www.cqu.edu.au/study/what-can-i-study/health-and-medical-sciences/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-of-science-chiropractic CQU - Bachelor of Science (Chiropractic)]</ref>

===Canada===
Canadian chiropractors received their Doctorate in Chiropractic (D.C.) following a minimum of 7 years of university.  There are currently two schools of chiropractic in Canada: [[Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College]], in Toronto, Ontario and the [[Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières|Universite du Quebec a Trois Rivieres]], in Trois Rivieres, Quebec. Both programs are fully accredited by the Canadian Federation of Chiropractic Regulatory and Educational Accrediting Boards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chirofed.ca/english/accreditation.html |title=Accreditation of Educational Programmes |work=Canadian Federation of Chiropractic Regulatory and Educational Accrediting Boards |accessdate=2009-10-16 }}</ref>  In 2010, the majority of students (87%) entering the CMCC program had completed a baccalaureate university degree, and approximately 3% have a graduate degree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmcc.ca/Page.aspx?pid=339 |title=An Overview of CMCC Admissions - Shortcuts: Admissions Brochure |work=Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College |accessdate=2011-08-21 }}</ref>

===South Africa===
In SA (South Africa) there are two schools of chiropractic: the [[Durban Institute of Technology]] and the [[University of Johannesburg]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chiropractic.co.za/index.html?lf=1;pg=14 |title=CASA : Student Info |accessdate=2009-10-19 }}</ref> They are both 6-year full-time courses leading to an MTECH or Masters of technology in Chiropractic. It's a legal requirement that chiropractors must be registered with the [http://www.ahpcsa.co.za Allied Health Professions Council of SA (AHPCSA)] the governmental statutory body in order to practice Chiropractic in SA. Being a member of the [http://www.chiropractic.co.za Chiropractic Association of SA (CASA)] is voluntary. CASA is the only voluntary national association in the country and aims to promote the profession through publications in newspaper, interviews, internet and public enquires over the phone.

===United Kingdom===
In 1993 Princess Diana visited the [[Anglo-European College of Chiropractic]] and became its patron by calling for legislation to prevent unqualified individuals from practicing Chiropractic in the UK.<ref name=patron>{{cite journal|last=Staff|first=|title=Chiropractic Report Calls for Registry of DCs in United Kingdom|journal=Dynamic Chiropractic |volume=11|page=|issue=13|date=June 18, 1993|url=http://www.chiroweb.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=42352}}</ref> In 1994, Parliament passed legislation regulating the practice of Chiropractic, like other health care professions, and creating the [[General Chiropractic Council]] as the regulatory board. Since that time, it is illegal to call oneself a Chiropractor in the UK without being registered with the General Chiropractic Council.<ref>{{cite web| title = Regulation of chiropractic| url = http://www.chiropractic-uk.co.uk/default.aspx?m=3&mi=19&ms=8&title=Regulation+of+chiropractic | accessdate = 12/02/2009 }}</ref> There are three UK chiropractic colleges with chiropractic courses recognised by the [[General Chiropractic Council]] (GCC), the statutory governmental body responsible for the regulation of chiropractic in the UK.<ref>[http://www.gcc-uk.org/page.cfm?page_id=25 GCC Criteria for Recognition of Degrees in Chiropractic]</ref>  [[McTimoney College of Chiropractic]] offers an Undergraduate Master Degree in human Chiropractic and two post-graduate Masters programmes in Animal Manipulation, plus a masters in Paediatric Chiropractic.<ref>[http://www.mctimoney-college.ac.uk/page/7_Prospectus.html McTimoney College Prospectus]</ref> The Anglo-European College of Chiropractic and the University of Glamorgan chiropractic graduates with the Masters degree (MChiro).

===United States===
American chiropractors received their Doctorate in Chiropractic (D.C.) following a minimum of 7 years of university.  There are currently 18 schools of chiropractic in the United States. In the United States, schools of chiropractic follow either a 'mixer' or 'straight' paradigm; the two schools of thought lead to two national bodies, the [[International Chiropractors Association]] and the [[American Chiropractic Association]].  Mixers form the majority of American chiropractors;<ref name="Keating05">{{cite book|author= Keating JC Jr|chapter= Philosophy in chiropractic|pages=77–98|title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic|edition=3rd|editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.''

==Chiropractic specialities==

===Chiropractic scientists (DC/PhD)===
Chiropractors can conduct clinical and basic scientific [[research]] and publish in [[peer-reviewed journal]]s during training and after graduation. Chiropractors can also pursue a [[doctor of philosophy|Ph.D]]  degree in various health care disciplines including [[epidemiology]], [[biomechanics]], [[neurophysiology]] and [[kinesiology]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Research chairs and professorships|url=http://www.canadianchiropracticresearchfoundation.com/research-chairs--professorships.html|publisher=Canadian Chiropractic Research Foundation|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref>

===Fellowships and other credentials===
Chiropractors, like other health care professionals, can pursue [[post-graduate]] education in various chiropractic specialties. Most are 2 year post-graduates degrees in chiropractic specialities such as clinical sciences, [[sports chiropractic]], radiology, [[animal chiropractic]] and others.There are other chiropractic credentials that may or may not be recognized by the major health care organizations, medical or chiropractic communities.  


==Chiropractic career==

Realistic median annual wage of chiropractors was $67,200 in May 2010 <ref>Occupational Outlook Handbook, Bureau of Labor Statistics, March 29, 2012: http://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/chiropractors.htm
</ref>.  According to Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Chiropractic Student Loan Default Rates for October 1999, May 2010, and January 2012 are 54%, 53.8%, and 52.8% respectively <ref>Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), January 2012:  http://www.chirobase.org/03Edu/
</ref>. Chiropractic school graduates default on their loans more often than law school graduates, engineers, medical doctors, and business school graduates.
