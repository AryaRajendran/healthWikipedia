The most common causes of viral hepatitis are the five unrelated hepatotropic viruses [[Hepatitis A]], [[Hepatitis B]], [[Hepatitis C]], [[Hepatitis D]], and [[Hepatitis E]].  In addition to the nominal hepatitis viruses, other viruses that can also cause liver inflammation include [[Herpes simplex]], [[Cytomegalovirus]], [[Epstein-Barr virus]], or [[Yellow fever]].

== Hepatitis viruses ==

The most common cause of the hepatits is by viral means. Although they are classified under the disease [[hepatitis]], these viruses are not all related.

=== Hepatitis A ===

{{main|Hepatitis A}}

''Hepatitis A'' or [[infectious jaundice]] is caused by hepatitis A virus (HAV), a [[picornavirus]] transmitted by the [[fecal-oral route]] often associated with ingestion of [[contaminated food]]. It causes an acute form of hepatitis and does not have a chronic stage. The patient's [[immune system]] makes [[antibodies]] against HAV that confer [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] against future infection. People with hepatitis A are advised to rest, stay hydrated and avoid alcohol. A vaccine is available that will prevent HAV infection for up to 10 years. Hepatitis A can be spread through personal contact, consumption of raw sea food or drinking [[contaminated water]]. This occurs primarily in [[third world countries]]. Strict personal hygiene and the avoidance of raw and unpeeled foods can help prevent an infection. Infected people excrete HAV with their [[feces]] two weeks before and one week after the appearance of [[jaundice]]. The time between the infection and the start of the illness averages 28 days (ranging from 15 to 50 days),<ref>{{cite web | title = CDC Hepatitis A FAQ | url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hepatitis/a/faqa.htm#general | accessdate = 2008-03-03}}</ref> and most recover fully within 2 months, although approximately 15% of [[sufferers]] may experience continuous or [[relapsing symptoms]] from six months to a year following initial [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]].<ref>{{cite web | title = CDC Hepatitis A Fact Sheet | url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hepatitis/a/fact.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-03}}</ref>

=== Hepatitis B ===

{{main|Hepatitis B}}

''Hepatitis B'' is caused by hepatitis B virus, a [[hepadnavirus]] that can cause both acute and chronic hepatitis. Chronic hepatitis develops in the 15% of adults who are unable to eliminate the virus after an initial infection. Identified methods of transmission include [[blood]] ([[blood transfusion]], now rare), [[tattoo]]s (both amateur and professionally done), [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually]] (through [[sexual intercourse]] or through contact with blood or bodily fluids), or via mother to child by [[breast feeding]] (minimal evidence of [[transplacental crossing]]). However, in about half of cases the source of infection cannot be determined. Blood contact can occur by sharing syringes in intravenous drug use, shaving accessories such as razor blades, or touching wounds on infected persons. [[Needle-exchange programme]]s have been created in many countries as a form of prevention.

Patients with chronic hepatitis B have antibodies against hepatitis B, but these antibodies are not enough to clear the infection of the affected [[liver cells]]. The continued production of virus combined with antibodies is a likely cause of the immune complex disease seen in these patients. A vaccine is available that will prevent infection from hepatitis B for life. Hepatitis B infections result in 500,000 to 1,200,000 deaths per year worldwide due to the complications of chronic hepatitis, [[cirrhosis]], and [[hepatocellular carcinoma]]. Hepatitis B is [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in a number of (mainly [[South-East Asia]]n) countries, making cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma big killers. There are six treatment options approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) available for persons with a chronic hepatitis B infection: [[alpha-interferon]], [[pegylated interferon]] [[adefovir]], [[entecavir]], [[telbivudine]] and [[lamivudine]]. About 65% of persons on treatment achieve a sustained response.

=== Hepatitis C ===

{{main|Hepatitis C}}

''Hepatitis C'' (originally "non-A non-B hepatitis") is caused by hepatitis C virus ([[HCV]]), an [[RNA virus]] that is a member of the [[Flaviviridae]] family. HCV can be transmitted through contact with blood (including through sexual contact if the two parties' blood is mixed) and can also cross the [[placenta]]. Hepatitis C usually leads to chronic hepatitis, culminating in [[cirrhosis]] in some people. It usually remains [[asymptomatic]] for decades. Patients with hepatitis C are susceptible to severe hepatitis if they contract either hepatitis A or B, so all persons with hepatitis C should be immunized against hepatitis A and hepatitis B if they are not already immune, and avoid alcohol. HCV viral levels can be reduced to undetectable levels by a combination of [[interferon]] and the [[antiviral drug]] [[ribavirin]]. The genotype of the [[virus]] is the primary determinant of the rate of response to this treatment regimen, with genotype 1 being the most resistant.

Hepatitis C is the most common chronic blood-borne infection in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HCV/index.htm |title=CDC DVH - Hepatitis C Information For the Health Professional |accessdate=2010-01-14}}</ref>

=== Hepatitis D ===

{{main|Hepatitis D}}

The ''Hepatitis D virus'' (HDV) or hepatitis delta agent is similar to a [[viroid]] as it can only propagate in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.

=== Hepatitis E ===

{{main|Hepatitis E}}

The ''Hepatitis E virus'' (HEV), probably from a Calicivirus family, produces symptoms similar to [[hepatitis A]], although it can take a [[fulminant]] course in some patients, particularly pregnant women; it is more prevalent in the [[Indian subcontinent]].

=== Hepatitis F virus ===

{{main|Hepatitis F}}

''Hepatitis F virus'' (HFV) is a hypothetical virus linked to hepatitis. Several hepatitis F virus candidates emerged in the 1990s; none of these reports have been substantiated.

=== GB virus C ===

{{main|GB virus C}}

The ''GB virus C'' is another potential viral cause of hepatitis that is probably spread by blood and sexual contact.<ref>{{cite journal
