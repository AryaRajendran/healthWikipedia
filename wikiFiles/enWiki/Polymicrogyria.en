  Caption        = This child presented with seizures. The coronal true inversion recovery sequence shows thickened and disordered cortex in superior frontal and cingulate gyri bilaterally (arrow). There are small convolutions visible at the corticomedullary junction. The appearance is that of cortical dysplasia, with polymicrogyria more likely than pachygyria due to the small convolutions visible. There are also small foci of grey matter signal in the corpus callosum, deep to the dysplastic cortex (double arrows). These probably represent areas of grey matter heterotopia. |

'''Polymicrogyria''' (PMG) is a [[human development (biology)|developmental]] malformation of the human [[brain]] characterized by an excessive number of small convolutions ([[gyri]]) on the surface of the brain. Either the whole surface (generalized) or parts of the surface (focal) can be affected.

==Clinical presentation==
The diagnosis of PMG is merely descriptive and is not a [[disease]] in itself, nor does it describe the underlying [[etiology]] or cause of the brain malformation.

Polymicrogyria may in fact be just one piece of a [[syndrome]] of developmental abnormalities, because children born with it may suffer from a wide spectrum of other problems, including: global [[developmental disabilities]], mild to severe [[mental retardation]], [[motor skills|motor]] dysfunctions including [[speech]] and [[swallowing]] problems, [[respiratory system|respiratory]] problems, and [[seizures]]. Though it is difficult to make a predictable [[prognosis]] for children with the diagnosis of PMG, there are some generalized clinical findings according to the areas of the brain that are affected.
*Bilateral frontal polymicrogyria (BFP)-Cognitive and motor delay, spastic [[quadriparesis]], epilepsy
*Bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP)-Severe cognitive and motor delay, seizures, dysconjugate gaze, [[cerebellar]] dysfunction
*Bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria (BPP)-Pseudobulbar signs, cognitive impairment, epilepsy, some with [[arthrogryposis]] and/or lower motor neuron disease
*Bilateral parasagittal parieto-occipital polymicrogyria (BPPP)-Partial seizures, some with mental retardation
*Bilateral generalized polymicrogyria (BGP)-Cognitive and motor delay of variable severity, seizures

==Diagnosis==
With increased use of [[Medical imaging|imaging techniques]] such as [[MRI]] and [[Computed tomography|CT]], polymicrogyria is becoming more widely diagnosed. However, polymicrogyria is often misdiagnosed as [[pachygyria]], [[ulegyria]] or [[lissencephaly]], even by experienced [[radiologist]]s, since the differences between these conditions can be difficult to see on an MRI or CT scan.

==Pathology==
Polymicrogyria is a disorder of [[neuronal]] migration resulting in structurally abnormal [[cerebral hemispheres]]. The Greek roots of the name describe its salient feature: many [poly] small [micro] gyri (convolutions in the surface of the brain). It is also characterized by shallow [[sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]], a slightly thicker [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]], neuronal [[Heterotopia (medicine)|heterotopia]] and enlarged [[Ventricular system|ventricles]]. When many of these small folds are packed tightly together, PMG may resemble [[pachygyria]] (a few "thick folds" - a mild form of [[lissencephaly]]).

==Etiology==
The etiology of polymicrogyria is unclear. It is currently classified as resulting from abnormalities during late neuronal migration or early cortical organization of fetal development. Evidence for both genetic and non-genetic etiologies exists. Polymicrogyria appears to occur around the time of neuronal migration or early cortical development. Non-genetic causes include defects in placental oxygenation and in association with congenital infections, particularly cytomegalovirus. 

An association with the gene [[WDR62]] has been identified.<ref name=pmid21496009>{{cite journal|last=Bhat|first=V|coauthors=Girimaji, SC, Mohan, G, Arvinda, HR, Singhmar, P, Duvvari, MR, Kumar, A|title=Mutations in WDR62, encoding a centrosomal and nuclear protein, in Indian primary microcephaly families with cortical malformations.|journal=Clinical genetics|date=2011 Apr 15|pmid=21496009|doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.2011.01686.x|pages=noâ€“no|volume=80|issue=6}}</ref><ref name=Murdock2011>Murdock DR, Clark GD, Bainbridge MN, Newsham I, Wu YQ, Muzny DM, Cheung SW, Gibbs RA, Ramocki MB (2011) Whole-exome sequencing identifies compound heterozygous mutations in WDR62 in siblings with recurrent polymicrogyria.Am J Med Genet A. 2011 Aug 10. {{doi|10.1002/ajmg.a.34165}}.</ref>
