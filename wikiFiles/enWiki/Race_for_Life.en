'''Race for Life''' is a series of fundraising events for women only, organised by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[charitable organization|charity]], [[Cancer Research UK]]. They involve [[running]], jogging or walking a 5-kilometre course and raising [[sponsorship]] for doing so.<br>
The money raised funds [[cancer research]] in all 200 types of cancer, however, none of the money from the entry fee (£14.99 for adults and £10 for children in 2012) actually benefits Cancer Research UK, only the additional sponsorship raised by participants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://raceforlife.cancerresearchuk.org/utilities/faqs/fees/index.html|title=Entry fees|work=Cancer Research UK Race for Life|accessdate=2012-06-21}}</ref> Following complaints from John Taylor, the 5K Run for Moore was launched - see Run for Moore

Race for Life was conceived, designed and launched by [http://www.cowanglobal.com/about/ Jim Cowan] specifically for raising awareness of women's cancers. The first Race for Life event took place in 1994 when 680 participants participated in a race in [[Battersea Park]], London and raised £36,000. Race for Life has subsequently grown to become one of the UK's largest fundraising events, which in 2006 involved 240 races, 750,000 participants and raised £46 million. Since Race for Life began in 1994, 6 million participants across the UK have raised over £493 million for the charity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raceforlife.org/about-us/what-is-race-for-life.aspx|title=About us|work=Cancer Research UK Race for Life|accessdate=2010-07-05}}</ref> Notable participants include [[Jane Tomlinson]], whose first fundraising event was a Race for Life in 2001 after being diagnosed with terminal [[breast cancer]].

Following complaints from John Taylor, stressing that the (5K Race for Life) was in breach of "Section 29 of the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act", which stated it was illegal to discriminate in the provision of Goods, Facilities and Services, the Equal Opportunities Commission wrote to Cancer Research UK which then launched the (5K Run for Moore).Kate Bracken See http://www.gazetteherald.co.uk/archive/2006/02/16/Ryedale+Archive/6670131.Men_urged_to_run_for_their_rights/

The proceeds from this event only went towards [[bowel cancer]] research and campaigns and the venture was discontinued in 2010.{{not in source|date=March 2012}}<ref name="Moore">[http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/bobbymoorefund/ Bobby Moore Fund website]</ref>
