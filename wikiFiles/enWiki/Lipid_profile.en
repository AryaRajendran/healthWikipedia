'''Lipid profile''' or ''lipid panel'', is a [[Test panel|panel]] of blood tests that serves as an initial broad medical screening tool for abnormalities in [[lipids]], such as [[cholesterol]] and [[triglycerides]]. The results of this test can identify certain [[Inborn error of lipid metabolism|genetic diseases]] and can determine approximate risks for [[cardiovascular disease]], certain forms of [[pancreatitis]], and other diseases.

Lipid panels are commonly ordered as part of a [[physical exam]], along with other panels such as the [[complete blood count]] (CBC) and [[basic metabolic panel]] (BMP).

== Components ==

The lipid profile typically includes:

* [[Low-density lipoprotein]]
* [[High-density lipoprotein]]
* [[Triglycerides]]
* [[cholesterol|Total cholesterol]]

Using these values, a laboratory may also calculate:
* [[Very low-density lipoprotein]]
* Cholesterol:HDL ratio

== Procedure and Indication ==
Current recommendations for cholesterol testing come from the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines, and are based on many large clinical studies, such as the [[Framingham Heart Study]].

For healthy adults with no cardiovascular risk factors, the ATP III guidelines recommend screening once every five years.<ref>{{cite pmid|12485966}}</ref> A lipid profile may also be ordered at regular intervals to evaluate the success of lipid-lowering drugs such as [[statins]].

In the pediatric and adolescent population, lipid testing is not routinely performed. However, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] and [[NHLBI]] now recommend that children aged 9–11 be screened once for severe cholesterol abnormalities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pediatric Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Guidelines - NHLBI, NIH|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cvd_ped/}}</ref> This screening can be valuable to detect [[Inborn error of lipid metabolism|genetic diseases]] such as [[familial hypercholesterolemia]] that can be lethal if not treated early.

Traditionally, most laboratories have required patients to fast for 9–12 hours before screening. However, recent studies have questioned the utility of fasting before lipid panels, and some diagnostic labs now routinely accept non-fasting samples.<ref>{{cite pmid|23147400}}</ref>

== Implications ==
This test is used to identify [[hyperlipidemia]] (various disturbances of cholesterol and triglyceride levels), many forms of which are recognized risk factors for [[cardiovascular disease]] and rarely [[pancreatitis]].

A total cholesterol reading can be used to assess an individual's risk for heart disease, however, it should not be relied upon as the only indicator. The individual components that make up total cholesterol reading –- LDL, HDL, and VLDL –- are also important in measuring risk.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}{{vague|date=December 2012}}

For instance, one's total cholesterol may be high, but this may be due to very high good (HDL) cholesterol levels –- which can actually help prevent heart disease{{vague|date=December 2012}}. So, while a high total cholesterol level may help give an indication that that there is a problem with cholesterol levels, the components that make up total cholesterol should also be measured.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}{{vague|date=December 2012}}
