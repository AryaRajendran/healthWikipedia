'''Post-exposure prophylaxis''' ('''PEP''') is any [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]] treatment started immediately after exposure to a pathogen (such as a disease-causing [[virus]]), in order to prevent infection by the pathogen and the development of disease.

==Rabies==
PEP is commonly and very effectively used to prevent the outbreak of [[rabies]] after a bite by a rabid animal.

The treatment consists of repeated injections of [[Rabies_vaccine | rabies vaccine]] and [[immunoglobulin]].<ref name="titleWHO | Guide for post-exposure prophylaxis">{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/rabies/human/postexp/en/index.html |title=WHO | Guide for post-exposure prophylaxis |accessdate=2008-03-05 |work=}}</ref>

==Tetanus==

Tetanus post-exposure consists of 2 to 3 injections of [[tetanus vaccine]] and tetanus immunoglobulin.

==HIV==

===History===
[[Zidovudine|AZT]] was approved as a treatment for AIDS in 1987.  As AIDS patients started seeking treatment in medical centers, it sometimes happened that a healthcare worker would be exposed to HIV during work.  Some people thought to try giving health care workers AZT to prevent [[seroconversion]].  This practice dramatically decreased the incidence of seroconversion among health workers when done under certain conditions.<ref name="healthcareworkers">{{cite PMID|9366579}}</ref>

Later the question arose of whether to give HIV treatment to people who had non-occupational exposure, for example, when a condom breaks while a person with HIV has unprotected sex with an HIV-negative person in a single incidence, or in the case of unprotected sex with an anonymous partner, or in the case of a non-habitual incident of sharing a syringe for [[Drug injection|injection drug use]].  Evidence suggests that PEP also reduces the risk of HIV infection in these cases.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1056/NEJM199704103361512}}</ref>

Since taking HIV-attacking medications shortly after exposure was proven to reduce the risk of contracting HIV, this led to research into [[pre-exposure prophylaxis]], which would mean taking medication before any exposure to HIV in anticipation of being in a situation which was likely to expose one to HIV infection.

===Treatment===
In the case of [[HIV]] exposure, post-exposure prophylaxis is a course of [[antiretroviral]] drugs which reduces the risk of [[seroconversion]] after events with high risk of exposure to HIV (e.g., unprotected [[anal sex|anal]] or [[vaginal sex]], [[needlestick injuries]], or [[needle sharing|sharing needles]]).<ref name="CDC">{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5402a1.htm |title=Antiretroviral Postexposure Prophylaxis After Sexual, Injection-Drug Use, or Other Nonoccupational Exposure to HIV in the United States |last1=Smith |first1=Dawn K. |last2=Grohskopf |first2=Lisa A. |last3=Black |first3=Roberta J. |last4=Auerbach |first4=Judith D. |last5=Veronese |first5=Fulvia |last6=Struble |first6=Kimberly A. |date=21 January 2005 |work=cdc.gov |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control]] |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref>  The [[Centers for Disease Control|CDC]] recommends PEP for any HIV negative person who has recently been exposed to HIV for any reason.<ref name="CDC"/>

To be most effective, treatment should begin within an hour of exposure.<ref name="ignorance">{{cite journal |last1=Diprose |first1=P |last2=Deakin |first2=C.D. |last3=Smedley |first3=J |year=2000 |title=Ignorance of post-exposure prophylaxis guidelines following HIV needlestick injury may increase the risk of seroconversion |journal=[[British Journal of Anaesthesia]] |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=767â€“770 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/84/6/767 |accessdate=7 July 2009 }}</ref> After 72 hours post-exposure PEP is much less effective, and may not be effective at all.<ref name="CDC"/> Prophylactic treatment for HIV typically lasts four weeks.<ref name="CDC"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://hab.hrsa.gov/tools/HIVpocketguide/PktGPEP.htm |title=HIV/AIDS Bureau - HIV Care Pocket Guide 2006 - Occupational HIV Postexposure Prophylaxis (PEP) |accessdate=2008-03-05 |work=}}</ref>

While there is compelling data to suggest that PEP after HIV exposure is effective, there have been cases where it has failed. Failure has often been attributed to the delay in receiving treatment (greater than 72 hours post-exposure), the level of exposure, duration of treatment (lack of adherence to the 28 day regimen), or all three. However, given that &mdash; for non-occupational exposures &mdash; the time and level of exposure are based on patient-supplied information, absolute data is unavailable. PEP can also slow down the development of antibodies while the medications are still being taken.  This can result in false negatives on an antibody test if the proper waiting period is not observed after completion of medications. The standard antibody window period begins after the last day of PEP treatment. Doctors will advise patients who received PEP to get an antibody test at 6 months post-exposure as well as the standard 3 month test.<ref name="CDC"/>

The antiretroviral regimen used in PEP is the same as the standard [[highly active antiretroviral therapy]] used to treat AIDS.  It requires close compliance and can have unpleasant side effects including [[malaise]], [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[diarrhea]], [[headache]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]].<ref name="CDC"/>

==Hepatitis A==
Human Normal Immunoglobulin (HNIG) and/or [[hepatitis A vaccine]] may be used as PEP depending on the clinical situation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Hepatitis B==

If the person exposed is an HBsAg positive source (a known responder to [[hepatitis B vaccine|HBV vaccine]]) then if exposed to hepatitis B a booster dose should be given. If they are in the process of being vaccinated or are a non-responder they need to have hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and the vaccine.  For known non-responders HBIG + vaccine should be given whilst those in the process of being vaccinated should have an accelerated course of HBV vaccine.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Hepatitis C==

Persons exposed to Hepatitis C should get monthly PCR - if seroconversion then interferon +/- ribavirin.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
