'''Anorectal varices''' refers to the [[vasodilation|dilation]] of collateral submucousal vessels due to backflow in the veins of the [[rectum]].<ref name="Katz1993">{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=JA|coauthors=Rubin, RA, Cope, C, Holland, G, Brass, CA|title=Recurrent bleeding from anorectal varices: successful treatment with a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.|journal=The American journal of gastroenterology|date=1993 Jul|volume=88|issue=7|pages=1104–7|pmid=8317414}}</ref> Typically this occurs due to [[portal hypertension]] which shunts venous blood from the [[portal venous system|portal system]] through the [[Portacaval anastomosis|portosystemic anastomosis]] that are present at this site into the [[systemic circulation|systemic venous system]].<ref>Hunt AH.

==Pathogenesis==
Blood from the superior portion of the [[rectum]] normally drains into the [[superior rectal veins|superior rectal vein]] via the [[inferior mesenteric vein]] to the [[liver]] as part of the [[portal venous system]]. Blood from the middle and inferior portions of the [[rectum]] is drained via the [[middle rectal vein|middle]] and [[inferior rectal vein]]s. In [[portal hypertension]] venous resistance is increased within the [[portal venous system]], when the pressure in the [[portal venous system]] increases above that of the [[systemic venous system|systemic]] blood is shunted through the [[Portacaval anastomosis|portosystemic anastomoses]]. The shunting of blood and consequential increase of pressure through the collateral veins causes the [[varicose veins|varicosities]].

==Diagnosis==
The terms [[rectal varices]] and [[haemorrhoids]] are often used interchangeably, but this is not correct.<ref>McCormack TT BHSJJA. Rectal varices are not piles. Br J Surg. Fev 1984;71(2):163.</ref> Haemorrhoids occur due to prolapse of the [[rectal venous plexus]] and are no more common in patients with portal hypertension than those without.<ref>Jacobs DM, Bubrick MP, Onstad GP, Hitchcock CR. The relationship of haemorrhoids to portal hypertension. Dis Col Rect 1980:23(8):567-9.</ref> Rectal varices however are only found in patients with portal hypertension and are common in conditions such as cirrhosis.<ref>Zuberi FF ZBKMKM. Frequency of rectal varices in patients with cirrhosis. J Coll Physicians Surg Pak. Feb 2004;14(2):94-7.</ref>

==Treatment==
Unlike [[esophageal varices|oesophageal varices]] rectal varices are less prone to bleeding, are less serious when a bleed does occur and are easier to treat because of the more accessible location.<ref>Johansen K. Bardin J. Orloff MJ. Massive bleeding from hemorrhoidal varices in portal hypertension. JAMA 1980:224 (18): 2084-5.</ref>

Typically, treatment consists of addressing the underlying portal hypertension. Some treatments include portosystemic shunting, ligation, and under-running suturing.<ref name="Hosking1989" /> Insertion of a [[transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt]] (TIPS) has been shown to alleviate varices caused by portal hypertension.<ref name="Katz1993" /> Successful treatment of portal hypertension that subsequently reduces anorectal varices provides a confirmation of the initial diagnosis, allowing for a distinction between varices and hemorrhoids, which would not have been alleviated by reduction of portal hypertension.
