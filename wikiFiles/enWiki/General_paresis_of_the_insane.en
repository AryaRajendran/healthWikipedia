'''General paresis''', also known as '''general paralysis of the insane''' or '''paralytic dementia''', is a [[neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatric]] disorder affecting the brain, caused by late-stage [[syphilis]]. GPI was originally considered a [[psychiatric]] disorder when it was first scientifically identified around the nineteenth century, as the patient usually presented with [[psychosis|psychotic]] symptoms of sudden and often dramatic onset. It is rare in most developed countries.

General paresis is based on the chronic [[meningoencephalitis]] that leads to [[cerebral atrophy]]. Degenerative changes are associated primarily with the frontal and temporal lobar cortex. Like syphilis itself, general paralysis is also treated with [[penicillin]]. The disease affects around 7 % of infected individuals, it also prevails among men.



==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of the disease first appear from 10 to 30 years after infection. Incipient GPI is usually manifested by [[neurasthenia|neurasthenic]] difficulties, such as fatigue, headaches, insomnia, dizziness, etc. As the disease progresses, the mental deterioration and personality changes occurs. Typical symptoms include loss of social inhibitions, asocial behavior, gradual impairment of judgement, concentration and short-term memory, [[euphoria]], [[mania]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], or [[apathy]]. Subtle shivering, minor defects in speech and [[Argyll Robertson pupil]] may become noticeable. 

[[Delusion]]s, which are common, tend to be poorly systematized and absurd. They can be grandiose, melancholic, or paranoid. These delusions include ideas of great wealth, immortality, thousands of lovers, unfathomable power, but also apocalypse, nihilism, self-blame, or bizarre hypochondriacal complaints. Later, the patient suffers from [[dysarthria]], [[intention tremor]]s, [[hyperreflexia]], [[myoclonus|myoclonic]] jerks, confusion, seizures and [[paresis|pareses]]. Eventually, the paretic dies bedridden, cachectic and completely disoriented. 

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis could be differentiated from other known psychoses and dementias by a characteristic abnormality in eye pupil reflexes ([[Argyll Robertson pupil]]), and, eventually, the development of muscular reflex abnormalities, [[seizure]]s, memory impairment ([[dementia]]) and other signs of relatively pervasive neurocerebral deterioration. Definitive diagnosis is based on the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and tests for syphilis.

==Prognosis==
Although there were recorded cases of remission of the symptoms, especially if they had not passed beyond the stage of psychosis, these individuals almost invariably suffered relapse within a few months to a few years. Otherwise, the patient was seldom able to return home because of the complexity, severity and unmanageability of the evolving symptom picture. Eventually, the patient would become completely incapacitated, bedfast, and die, the process taking about three to five years on average.

==History==
<!-- Needs citation -->
While retrospective studies have found earlier instances of what may have been the same disorder, the first clearly identified examples of paresis among the insane were described in Paris after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. General paresis of the insane was first described as a distinct disease in 1822 by [[Antoine Laurent Bayle|Antoine Laurent Jesse Bayle]]. General paresis most often struck people (men far more frequently than women) between twenty and forty years of age. By 1877, for example, the superintendent of an asylum for men in New York reported that in his institution this disorder accounted for more than twelve percent of the admissions and more than two percent of the deaths.

Originally, the cause was believed to be an inherent weakness of character or constitution. While [[Johannes Friedrich August von Esmarch|Esmarch]] and [[Peter Willers Jessen (junior)|Jessen]] had asserted as early as 1857 that [[syphilis]] caused general paresis, progress toward the general acceptance by the medical community of this idea was only accomplished later by the eminent nineteenth-century syphilographer [[Alfred Fournier]] (1832â€“1914).  In 1913 all doubt about the syphilitic nature of paresis was finally eliminated when [[Hideyo Noguchi]] and [[J. W. Moore]] demonstrated the syphilitic [[spirochaete]]s in the brains of paretics.

In 1917 [[Julius Wagner-Jauregg]] discovered that [[Pyrotherapy|infecting paretic patients]] with [[malaria]] could halt the progression of general paresis. He won a [[Nobel Prize]] for this discovery in 1927. After [[World War II]] the use of [[penicillin]] to treat syphilis made general paresis a rarity:  even patients manifesting early symptoms of actual general paresis were capable of full recovery with a course of penicillin.  The disorder is now virtually unknown outside [[developing countries]], and even there the epidemiology is substantially reduced.

In her 1915 novel, ''[[The Song of the Lark]]'', [[Willa Cather]] referred to the insanity of the wife of a main character as having been caused by general paresis but there is no hint that the character had contracted syphilis.  In her 1953 novel, ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'', [[Agatha Christie]] used paresis as an explanation for the  behavior of the victim. She did not mention the syphilitic connection.
