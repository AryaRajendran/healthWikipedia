'''Charles Everett Koop''', [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] (October 14, 1916&nbsp;– February 25, 2013) was an American [[pediatric surgeon]] and public health administrator. He was a [[Vice Admiral (United States)|vice admiral]] in the [[United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps|Public Health Service Commissioned Corps]],<ref name="Bloomberg death"/> and served as the 13th [[Surgeon General of the United States]] under President [[Ronald Reagan]] from 1982 to 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/499/000022433/ |title=C.

Koop was known for his work on tobacco prevention, AIDS, abortion, and the rights of disabled children.

==Early life and education==
Koop was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York, the only child of John Everett Koop (1883–1972), a banker and descendant of 17th-century Dutch settlers, and Helen (née Apel) Koop (1894–1970).<ref name="NYT death forceful"/> In 1937, he earned his A.B.<!--{{clarify|date=February 2013|reason=Bachelor's?

==Career==
===Medical career===
From 1946 to 1981, Koop was the surgeon-in-chief at the [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]] (CHOP).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2013/02/former-surgeon-general-c-everett-koop-leaves-public-health-legacy-on-aids.html|title=Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop Leaves Legacy on AIDS, Smoking|date=February 25, 2013|publisher=PBS|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}</ref> Koop was able to establish the nation's first neonatal surgical intensive care unit there in 1956.<ref name="NIH2">{{cite web|url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/QQ/p-nid/84|title=The C. Everett Koop Papers: Biographical Information|date=2013|publisher=Profiles.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}</ref>  He helped establish the [[biliary atresia]] program at CHOP when pioneering surgeon Morio Kasai came to work with him in the 1970s.  He also established the pediatric surgery fellowship training program at CHOP.  During his tenure there he graduated thirty-five residents and fourteen foreign fellows, many of whom went on to become professors of pediatric surgery, directors of divisions of pediatric surgery, and surgeons-in-chief of children's hospitals.

Koop became a professor of pediatric surgery in 1959 and professor of [[pediatrics]] in 1971 at the [[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania|University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]].<ref name="Dartmouth School of Medicine bio"/>

While a surgeon in Philadelphia, Koop performed groundbreaking surgical procedures on [[conjoined twins]], invented techniques which today are commonly used for infant surgery, and saved the lives of countless children who otherwise might have been allowed to die. He invented anesthetic and surgical techniques for small bodies and metabolisms and participated in the separation of several sets of conjoined twins whose condition other physicians at the time considered hopeless. He first gained international recognition in 1957 by the separation of two female pygopagus infants (conjoined at the [[Human pelvis|pelvis]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/conjoined/separation.html |title=From 'Monsters' to Modern Medical Miracles – Separation Surgeries (20th century-present) |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=September 23, 2009}}</ref> and then, again, in 1974 by the separation of two ischiopagus twins (conjoined at the [[Vertebral column|spine]]) sharing a liver, colon, and parts of the intestines with their entire trunks merged.

Koop was active in publishing articles in the medical literature.  Koop later wrote that "each day of those early years in pediatric surgery I felt I was on the cutting edge.  Some of the surgical problems that landed on the operating table at Children's had not even been named.  Many of the operations I performed had never been done before.  It was an exuberant feeling, but also a little scary.  At times I was troubled by fears that I wasn't doing things the right way, that I would have regrets, or that someone else had performed a certain procedure successfully but had never bothered to write it up for the medical journals, or if they had I couldn't find it."<ref>{{cite book|last=Koop|first=Charles Everett|title=Koop: The Memoirs of America's Family Doctor|publisher=HarperPaperbacks|date=March 1, 1993|pages=127|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=czrZOVnx3EQC|accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref>  Koop helped rectify this by publishing his own findings and results.  Additionally, he became the first editor of the ''Journal of Pediatric Surgery'' when it was founded in 1966.<ref name="Dartmouth School of Medicine bio"/>

In contrast to his years as surgeon general, when it was his policies and speeches that had bearing on other people, his years as an operating pediatric surgeon involved a more individualized, direct, hands-on effect on others.  During the course of his long career, for example, he performed some seventeen thousand [[inguinal hernia]] repairs and over seven thousand orchidopexies (surgery for correcting [[undescended testicle]]).  He developed new procedures, such as the colon interposition graft for correcting [[esophageal atresia]] (congenital lack of continuity of the esophagus) or ventriculoperitoneal shunts for treatment of [[hydrocephalus]] (accumulation of excessive cerebral spinal fluid in and around the brain causing neurological problems).<ref name="NIH2"/>  He also tackled many difficult cases ranging from childhood cancer to surgeries done on [[conjoined twins]], of which he and his colleagues operated upon ten pairs during his 35-year tenure.  In all he operated on many children and babies with congenital defects 'incompatible with life but amenable to surgical correction'.

In 1976, Koop wrote ''The Right to Live, The Right to Die'', setting down his concerns about abortion, infanticide, and euthanasia.<ref name="NIH2"/>  Koop also took some time off from his surgical practice to make a series of films with Christian apologist [[Francis Schaeffer]] in 1978, entitled ''Whatever Happened to the Human Race?'' in 1978.<ref name="NIH2"/>

President Ronald Reagan, shortly after his first inauguration, appointed Koop Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health in February 1981.<ref name="Bloomberg death"/> It was understood that Reagan would later nominate Koop to be surgeon general.<ref name="Bloomberg death"/>

===U.S. Surgeon General===
As expected, Koop was nominated for U.S. surgeon general by Reagan later in 1981.<ref name="HuffPost Ring Cass"/> Many liberal politicians and women's groups opposed the nomination because of Koop's very conservative views and strong anti-abortion beliefs.<ref name="HuffPost Ring Cass"/> His nomination was confirmed by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] on November 16, 1981, by a vote of 60–24.<ref name="Pittsburgh Press sworn in">{{cite news|title=Koop Takes Office as Surgeon General in Quite Ceremony|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IckdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CV4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=2328,2875603&dq=c-everett-koop+surgeon-general+confirmation&hl=en|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=January 22, 1982}}</ref> He was sworn into office on January 21 the following year.<ref name="Pittsburgh Press sworn in"/>

====Koop Report====
Koop, an opponent of abortion, resisted pressure from the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] in 1987 to prepare a report stating that abortion was psychologically harmful to women.<ref name="NYT abortion">{{cite news|title=U.S. Data on Abortion Censored, House Unit Says|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/11/us/us-data-on-abortion-censored-house-unit-says.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 11, 1989}}</ref> He said it was not a public-health issue, but rather a moral one.<ref name="Bloomberg death">{{cite news|last=Schoifet|first=Mark|title=C.

Walter obtained a list of articles from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), authored mostly by CDC abortion-surveillance staff, and consulted with [[Alan Guttmacher Institute]] personnel. Walter wrote a draft report on his findings and gave it to Koop.

In a January 10, 1989, letter to Reagan, Koop said that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate issuing the finding desired by the administration.<ref name="NYT abortion"/><ref name="Bloomberg death"/><ref name="NYT Leary">{{cite news|last=Leary|first=Warren E.|title=Koop Says Abortion Report Couldn't Survive Challenge|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/17/us/koop-says-abortion-report-couldn-t-survive-challenge.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 17, 1989}}</ref> He also commented about how some of the president's advisers thought "it was a foregone conclusion that the negative health effects of abortion on women were so overwhelming that the evidence would force the reversal of [[Roe vs. Wade]]".<ref name="NYT Leary"/>

Koop did not present the draft report to Reagan and claimed he never approved it.<ref name="NYT Leary"/> In March 1989, the "Koop Report" became public after it was [[subpoena]]ed and became part of a [[United States House of Representatives|Congressional]] subcommittee hearing.<ref name="NYT Leary"/> Although there were allegations that the report had not been released previously because it was biased, the document contained all arguments on both sides of the issue.<ref name="NYT Leary"/>

===Later career===
Following his career as Surgeon General, Koop was on The Firestorm Solutions Expert Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firestorm.com/en/cms/?800 |title=Firestorm Solutions – Surgeon General C. Everett Koop Joins Firestorm Expert Council |publisher=Firestorm.com |accessdate=September 23, 2009}}</ref> Koop hosted a documentary series in 1991, simply titled ''[[C. Everett Koop, M.D.]]'' It aired for six episodes on [[NBC]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Goodman |first=Walter |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DB123DF937A35755C0A967958260 |title=Review/Television; Health Care of America's Children – New York Times |work=New York Times |date=June 4, 1991 |accessdate=September 23, 2009}}</ref>

Koop and other investors established drkoop.com in 1997, during the [[dot-com bubble]].<ref name="USA Today death"/> This medical information website was one of the first major online sources of health information. Critical review of the site content revealed that many of the private care listings, medicinal recommendations, and medical trial referrals were paid advertisements. The website went bankrupt in 2001<ref name="USA Today death"/> and the address now re-directs to another health-related website. Koop continued to endorse [[Life Alert]] bracelets for the elderly.

In 1999 testimony before Congress, Koop minimized concerns from health groups about the severity of allergies to latex gloves.<ref name="Bloomberg death"/> It was later discovered that a company that manufactured latex gloves had previously paid Koop $650,000 for consulting work.<ref name="Bloomberg death"/>

Koop held three professorships at [[Dartmouth Medical School]], where he was also the senior scholar at the C. Everett Koop Institute.<ref name="Dartmouth School of Medicine bio"/>

==Legacy==
Koop is perhaps most remembered for four facets of his professional work:

; Abortion: Though Koop was opposed to abortion on personal and religious grounds,<ref name="NYT Koop's Stand">{{cite news|last=Tolchin|first=Martin|title=Koop's Stand on Abortion's Effect Surprises Friends and Foes Alike|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/11/us/koop-s-stand-on-abortion-s-effect-surprises-friends-and-foes-alike.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 11, 1989}}</ref><ref name="NYT death forceful">{{cite news|last=Noble|first=Holcomb B.|title=C.

; Tobacco: In his 1988 Report of the Surgeon General, it was reported that [[nicotine]] has an addictiveness similar to that of heroin or [[cocaine]]. Koop's report was somewhat unexpected, especially by those who expected him to maintain the status quo in regard to his office's position on tobacco products. During his tenure, in 1984, Congress passed legislation providing for new, rotated health warning labels on cigarette packs and required advertising to include the labels. Those labels remain unchanged today. New labels containing graphic depictions of smoking-caused illness and death have been announced by the FDA, but are on hold pending the outcome of tobacco industry legal challenges. Koop issued a challenge to Americans in 1984 to "create a smoke-free society in the United States by the year 2000."<ref>Koop CE. Call for a smoke-free society. Pediatric Pulmonology 1985;1:4–5</ref>  As Surgeon General, he released eight reports on the health consequences of tobacco use,<ref>

Profiles.nlm.nih.gov. Retrieved on 2013-02-27.</ref> Gay activists and their supporters were unhappy with the way in which he targeted gay sex and the risk of infection through anal sexual intercourse as primary vectors of the disease, but Koop was unapologetic claiming such activities entail risks several orders of magnitude greater than other means of transmission.  Religious activists, upset over the pamphlet's frank discussion of sexual practices and advocacy of condom use, called for Koop's resignation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/QQ/p-nid/87 |title=The C. Everett Koop Papers: AIDS, the Surgeon General, and the Politics of Public Health |publisher=Profiles.nlm.nih.gov |date=October 22, 1986 |accessdate=September 23, 2009}}</ref> Koop also infuriated some former supporters by advocating sex education in schools, possibly as early as the third grade, including later instruction regarding the proper use of condoms to combat the spread of AIDS.  While a straightforward telling to the public about the disease was controversial, Koop was also criticized by some health activists who claimed that his office had not gone far enough in attempting to develop a cure or vaccine, reducing the role of his office to educating the public on health concerns.
;Baby Doe and the Rights of Handicapped Children: In April 1982, a child born in [[Bloomington, Indiana]], was diagnosed with [[Down syndrome]] as well as [[esophageal atresia]] with [[tracheoesophageal fistula]].  Six days later, after court involvement and parental discussion involving disagreement among physicians about whether or not to treat the baby or let him die, the baby died, having been denied surgical treatment to correct his esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula. Baby Doe, as he would be known, became a symbol for children with birth defects, handicapped infants, and the debate over infanticide.  Koop was not initially involved with the Baby Doe case but had a special interest in it.  As a pediatric surgeon in Philadelphia, he and his colleagues had operated on 475 such babies during his 35 years there, with ever-increasing survival rates.  During his last eight years in active practice, Koop never lost a full-term baby upon whom he had operated to correct esophageal atresia.  It was due to this background that he became actively involved championing policies to protect the rights of newborns with defects, which led to Congress passing the [[Baby Doe Amendment]].

These four issues combined with Koop's personality and his willingness to make use of mass media brought to the office of Surgeon General a higher public profile than it previously had merited; he is, for instance, the first Surgeon General to have been the subject of a popular song – "Promiscuous", by [[Frank Zappa]]. Koop was well known for his [[Chin curtain|mustache-less beard]] and colorful [[bow tie]]s. During much of his day-to-day work, Koop wore the Surgeon General's US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps uniform, a uniform similar to that of a U.S. Navy Vice Admiral's.  During his tenure he re-instated the daily wearing of the PHS uniform by the officers of the PHS.

==Personal life==
In early 1968, Koop's son David was killed in a rock climbing accident on [[Cannon Mountain]] during his junior year at Dartmouth College. Koop later wrote that because of his son's death he thought, "I might be better able to help parents of dying children, but for quite a while I felt less able, too emotionally involved.  And from that time on, I could rarely discuss the death of a child without tears welling up into my eyes."<ref name="memoir">''Koop: The Memoirs of America's Family Doctor'',Charles Everett Koop, HarperPaperbacks Mar 1, 1993, p. 126</ref> Years later, he and his wife wrote a book called ''Sometimes Mountains Move'' to help others who had lost a child.

In February 2007, Elizabeth Koop, his wife of nearly 70 years, died.  On April 17, 2010, he married Cora Hogue, a former staff member of [[Tenth Presbyterian Church]] in Philadelphia.

At a 2010 news conference, Koop spoke from a wheelchair and said that he was "very, very deaf" and legally blind.<ref name="USA Today death"/>
