'''Desomorphine''' ('''dihydrodesoxymorphine''', '''Permonid''') is an [[opioid]] invented in 1932 in the United States that is a derivative of [[morphine]], where the 6-hydroxyl group has been removed and the 7,8 double bond has been reduced.<ref>{{cite patent

== "Krokodil" ==
Desomorphine attracted attention in 2010 in [[Russia]] due to an increase in clandestine production, presumably due to its relatively simple synthesis from [[codeine]]. The drug is easily made from codeine, [[iodine]] and [[red phosphorus]],<ref>{{cite journal |pages=361–70 |doi=10.1134/S1061934808040096 |title=Chromatographic study of expert and biological samples containing desomorphine |year=2011 |last1=Savchuk |first1=S.

The street name in Russia for home-made desomorphine is "'''krokodil'''" (крокодил, crocodile), reportedly due to the scale-like appearance of skin of its users and the derivation from chlorocodide.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.pravda.ru/hotspots/crimes/23-06-2011/118296-desomorphine-0/ |title=Desomorphine, drug for the poor, kills all of its victims |first=Arthur |last=Priymak |date=June 23, 2011 |work=[[Pravda]]}}</ref> Due to difficulties in procuring [[heroin]], combined with easy and cheap access to over-the-counter pharmacy products containing codeine in Russia, use of "krokodil" has been on the increase. The high associated with krokodil is akin to that of heroin, but lasts a much shorter period. While the effects of heroin use can last four to eight hours, the effects of krokodil do not usually extend past one and one half hours, with the symptoms of withdrawal setting in soon after. Krokodil takes roughly 30 minutes to an hour to prepare with over-the-counter ingredients in a kitchen.<ref>{{cite web|last=Veronese|first=Keith|title=Krokodil: Russia’s Designer Drug That Will Eat Your Flesh|url=http://io9.com/5859291/krokodil-russias-designer-drug-that-will-eat-your-flesh|accessdate=11/27/2012}}</ref> Since the home-made mix is routinely injected immediately with little or no further purification, "krokodil" has become notorious for producing severe tissue damage, [[phlebitis]] and [[gangrene]], sometimes requiring limb amputation in long-term users.<ref>http://mosmedservice.com/index/dezomorfin/0-80</ref> The amount of tissue damage is so high that addicts' life expectancies are said to be as low as two to three years, especially as they are often highly susceptible to infections and gangrene due to widespread [[HIV]] infection among injecting drug users in Russia. <ref name="independent">{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/krokodil-the-drug-that-eats-junkies-2300787.html |title=Krokodil: The drug that eats junkies |date=June 22, 2011 |work=The Independent |first=Shaun |last=Walker}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2078355,00.html |title=The Curse of the Crocodile: Russia's Deadly Designer Drug |first=Simon |last=Shuster |date=June 20, 2011 |work=Time}}</ref><ref>[http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/marina-akhmedova/snap-goes-crocodile Snap goes the Crocodile.

Abuse of home-made desomorphine was first reported in middle and eastern Siberia in 2002, but has since spread throughout Russia and the neighboring former Soviet republics. In October 2011, indications of "krokodil" use were found in Germany, with some media outlets claiming several dead users.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bild.de/news/inland/ueberdosis/deutschland-kaempft-gegen-neue-todesdroge-20456878.bild.html |title=Deutschland kämpft gegen neue todesdroge |trans_title=Germany fights new death-drug |language=German |date=October 14, 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-10 |work=[[Bild]]}}</ref> One death in Poland in December 2011 was also believed to be caused by "krokodil" use, and its use has been confirmed among Russian expatriate communities in a number of other European countries.<ref>{{Cite pmid|22385107}}</ref>

===Other ingredients===
While crude amateur attempts to make krokodil will almost invariably still contain some remaining codeine as well as other, "accidentally produced" synthetic [[opioids]] such as iodocodeine, some of the krokodil produced also contains other drugs. For example, the codeine pills sold in Russia may also contain ingredients such as caffeine, [[paracetamol]], or [[diphenhydramine]] (coincidentally an opioid potentiator); while chemicals such as [[tropicamide]], found in over the counter eyedrops, may also be added to the mixture in attempt to prolong or enhance the experience. <ref name="vicedoc">{{cite web | url=http://www.vice.com/vice-news/siberia-krokodil-tears-full-length | title=Siberia: Krokodil Tears - Full Length | accessdate=May 14, 2012}}</ref>
