'''Emergency medical services in [[Israel]]''' are provided by the [[Magen David Adom]] (MDA) organization, supplemented in some areas by [[Hatzalah]], and the [[Palestinian Red Crescent Society]].

==Organization==
===Land Ambulance===
[[Image:MDA Armoured Ambulance.jpg|thumb|Armoured Mobile Intensive Care Unit]]
While the MDA currently has approximately 1,200 medics, paramedics and emergency physicians on staff, it still relies heavily on over 12,000 volunteers who serve in both operational and administrative capacities. The organization operates 95 stations with a fleet of over 700 ambulances.  The majority of the fleet consists of [[Basic Life Support]] (BLS) ambulances. These are supplemented by [[Advanced Life Support]] (ALS) ambulances, [[Mobile Intensive Care Ambulance|mobile intensive care unit]]s (MICU) and a variety of first responders.  First responders sometimes include the United [[Hatzalah]] organization.  In an unusual feature, armored ambulances are not uncommon nationwide.   The system is highly dependent on volunteers, many of whom are from outside of Israel.  As a recognized [[national aid society]], according to the [[Geneva Conventions]] MDA may become an auxiliary arm of the [[Israeli Defence Force]] during wartime.  Young people holding dual citizenship, often from the U.S., are permitted to fulfill their [[national service]] obligations by serving in MDA, instead of in the regular military.
Most major stations also include special units for responding to mass-casualty incidents like natural disasters or terrorist attacks.  The system, for the most part, conforms to the Franco-German (as opposed to the Anglo-American) <ref>{{cite journal |author=Dick WF |title=Anglo-American vs. Franco-German  emergency medical services system |journal=Prehosp Disaster Med |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=29–35; discussion 35–7 |year=2003 |pmid=14694898 |doi= |url=}}</ref> model of EMS care, and the presence of physicians at high-acuity emergencies is not uncommon.  In addition, emergency ambulance service is supplemented by a variety of private carriers who are tasked with interfacility transfers only.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ambulanceisrael.com/?page_id=5 | title=Ambulance Israel website| accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>

===Air Ambulance===
[[Image:IAF-AS-565.jpg|thumb|Prior to 2008, air ambulance service was provided by the military.]]
Air ambulance service was provided by [[Israeli Air Force]] [[MEDEVAC]] [[helicopters]], however, in 2008 civil HEMS was introduced by Magen David Adom in partnership with a private company called Lahak Aviation Ltd, utilizing four [[Germany|German]]-made [[MBB Bo 105]]s staffed with MDA paramedics.  Lahak deployed them throughout the country in order to improve response times in peripheral areas. Previous attempts to integrate independent helicopter service in the 1970s were unsuccessful due to high cost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shephard.co.uk/Rotorhub/default.aspx?Action=745115149&ID=740a002d-49f9-4da1-99e7-660482976627|title=Rotorhub website|accessdate=2008-09-26}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  Non-emergency and repatriation air ambulance service is normally provided by a variety of private charter carriers such as Arrow Aviation in Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.arrowaviation.biz/medical-flights.php?lang=en|title=Air Ambulance website|accessdate=2011-08-02}}</ref>

==Standards==
===Vehicles===
[[Image:Mda motorcycle.JPG|thumb|MDA First Responder]]
Most of the fleet is made up of regular size vans staffed by "medics" (Hovesh) and "advanced medics" (Hovesh Bacir) as well as teenage and international volunteers (often qualified as first responders) and advanced life support ambulances, staffed by paramedics; mobile intensive care units, staffed by paramedics and physicians, respond only to the most medically serious cases.  The vehicles compare in general terms with American or European ambulances, however compliance with either the [[KKK 1822]] or [[CEN 1789]] standard is not compulsory.  In addition, first responders will often proceed to calls in their own vehicles, and could be anything from a private car to a motor scooter.

===Training and staffing===

As previously stated, the MDA uses a broad range of staff from First Responders to Physicians, and both volunteers and paid staff.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ellis DY, Sorene E|title=Magen David Adom: The EMS in Israel|journal=Resuscitation|volume=76|number=1|year=2008|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=19976417|doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2007.07.014|pages=5|pmid=17767990|issue=1}}</ref>  First responders typically receive 60 hours of training to prepare them for their roles.  Paid employees are required to be certified at the Hovesh level, which requires approximately 170–200 hours of training.  The next step is the Hovesh Bacir which requires a further two weeks of training.  Those certified at the Hovesh level are permitted to operate AEDs and to start IVs.([[Automated external defibrillator|AED]]) <ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.international-ems.com/il.htm |title=International EMS website|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>  Paramedics may be trained over a period of 15 months, with nine months of didactic and hospital clinical time, and a six month preceptorship with a qualified paramedic on a mobile intensive care unit ambulance.  Increasingly, however, paramedics are choosing another option; obtaining a three year B-EMS in Emergency Medicine from Ben Gurion University in Beer Sheva with the MDA paramedics course as part of their curriculum.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Levy G, Goldstein L, Erez Y, Levite R|title=Physician versus Paramedic in the Setting of Ground Forces Operations: Are They Interchangeable?|journal=Military Medicine|volume=March 2007|pages=2|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3912/is_200703/ai_n18755588/pg_2|year=2007}}</ref>
In an unusual move aimed at raising revenue to offset operating costs, MDA has begun to market its expertise at emergency care and system organization on an international level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdais.org/e/316/3665.htm|title=MDA Training website|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>  They have achieved some success in this endeavour, assisting the nation of [[Chile]] with the development of a national EMS system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Mashav%20%E2%80%93%20International%20Development/Publications/1999/Operating%20a%20National%20Emergency%20Medical%20Service%20Net|title=Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs website|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>

===Dispatch===
Ambulances are dispatched from regional dispatch centres, except during wars or other emergencies when service is provided from a national dispatch centre.  This centre uses dispatch technologies such as Automatic Vehicle Locating ([[AVL]]) and decision-support software that are comparable with U.S. and European systems.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P1-89862917.html|title=Jerusalem Post article|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>  The national emergency number for an ambulance in Israel is 101.  This number is answered by MDA around the clock.

===Response times===
MDA claims response times of under six minutes for major emergencies, the majority of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.pioneerlocal.com/northbrook/news/1129709,nb-medic-082808-s1.article|title=Northbrook News website|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>  It is unclear whether this is the  result of extremely dense ambulance coverage (1:10,000 pop.),  the high number of volunteer first responders, or the method used for calculating response time.
