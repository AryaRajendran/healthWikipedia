A '''delusion''' is a [[belief]] held with strong conviction despite superior evidence to the contrary.<ref name=wordnet>{{cite web|title=Delusion|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=delusion|publisher=Princeton - Wordnet|accessdate=8 April 2011}}</ref> As a pathology, it is distinct from a belief based on false or incomplete information, [[confabulation]], [[dogma]], [[illusion]], or other effects of [[perception]].

Delusions typically occur in the context of neurological or [[mental illness]], although they are not tied to any particular disease and have been found to occur in the context of many pathological states (both physical and mental). However, they are of particular diagnostic importance in [[psychosis|psychotic]] disorders including [[schizophrenia]], [[paraphrenia]], [[Mania|manic]] episodes of [[bipolar disorder]], and [[psychotic depression]].

==Definition==
Although non-specific concepts of madness have been around for several thousand years, the psychiatrist and philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]] was the first to define the three main criteria for a belief to be considered delusional in his 1913 book ''General Psychopathology''.<ref>{{Cite book

| last = Jaspers
| first = Karl
| title = Allgemeine Psychopathologie. Ein Leitfaden für Studierende, Ärzte und Psychologen.

| year = 1913
}}</ref> These criteria are:
* certainty (held with absolute conviction)
* incorrigibility (not changeable by compelling counterargument or proof to the contrary)
* impossibility or falsity of content (implausible, bizarre or patently untrue)<ref>{{harvnb|Jaspers|1997|p=106}}</ref>

Furthermore, when a false belief involves a value judgment, it is only considered as a delusion if it is so extreme that it cannot be or ever can be proven true (example: a man claims that he flew into the sun and flew back home. This would be considered a delusion).<ref name="A">{{cite web|url=http://www.abess.com/glossary.html#D |title=Terms in the Field of Psychiatry and Neurology |date=|accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>

==Types==
Delusions are categorized into four different groups:
* '''Bizarre delusion:''' A delusion that is very strange and completely implausible; an example of a bizarre delusion would be that aliens have removed the reporting person's brain.
* '''Non-bizarre delusion:''' A delusion that, though false, is at least possible, e.g., the affected person mistakenly believes that he is under constant police surveillance.
* '''Mood-congruent delusion:''' Any delusion with content consistent with either a depressive or manic state, e.g., a depressed person believes that news anchors on television highly disapprove of him, or a person in a manic state might believe she is a powerful deity.
* '''Mood-neutral delusion:''' A delusion that does not relate to the sufferer's emotional state; for example, a belief that an extra limb is growing out of the back of one's head is neutral to either depression or mania.<ref name="minddisorders.com">Source: http://www.minddisorders.com/Br-Del/Delusions.html</ref>

===Themes===
In addition to these categories, delusions often manifest according to a consistent theme. Although delusions can have any theme, certain themes are more common. Some of the more common delusion themes are:<ref name="minddisorders.com" />
* '''Delusion of control''': This is a false belief that another person, group of people, or external force controls one's general thoughts, feelings, impulses, or behavior.
* '''[[Cotard delusion]]''': This is a false belief that one does not exist or has become deceased.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Berrios G.E., Luque R. | year = 1995 | title = Cotard Syndrome: clinical analysis of 100 cases | url = | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | volume = 91 | issue = 3| pages = 185–188 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1995.tb09764.x | pmid = 7625193 }}</ref>
* '''[[Delusional jealousy]]''': A person with this delusion falsely believes that a person is lying to them or that a spouse or lover is having an affair, with no proof to back up their claim.
* '''Delusion of guilt or sin (or delusion of self-accusation)''': This is a false feeling of remorse or guilt of delusional intensity.
* '''Delusion of mind being read''': The false belief that other people can know one's thoughts.
* '''Delusions of thought insertion''': The belief that you can read other people's minds
* '''[[Ideas of reference|Delusion of reference]]''': The person falsely believes that insignificant remarks, events, or objects in one's environment have personal meaning or significance.
* '''[[Erotomania]]''' A delusion where someone believes another person is in love with them.
* '''[[Religious delusion|Grandiose Religious delusion]]''': the belief that the affected person is a god, or chosen to act as a god.<ref name=ReligiousDelusion1>{{cite web|title=Religious delusions are common symptoms of schizophrenia.|url=http://www.sciforums.com/showthread.php?t=51361|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref><ref name=ReligiousDelusion2>{{cite web|last=M|first=Raja|title=Religious delusion|url=http://www.sanp.ch/pdf/2000/2000-01/2000-01-058.PDF|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref>
* '''Somatic delusion''': A delusion whose content pertains to bodily functioning, bodily sensations, or physical appearance. Usually the false belief is that the body is somehow diseased, abnormal, or changed—for example, individuals effected by [[Anorexia nervosa]] or [[Bulimia nervosa]] may perceive their own body as being much larger than it actually is.
* '''[[Delusional parasitosis]]''': a delusion in which one feels infested with an [[insect]], [[bacteria]], [[mite]], [[spiders]], [[lice]], [[fleas]], [[worm]]s, or other organisms. Affected individuals may also report being repeatedly bitten. In some cases, [[entomologists]] are asked to investigate cases of mysterious bites. Sometimes physical manifestations may occur including [[skin lesions]].<ref name="D">{{cite web|url=http://www.livingwithbugs.com/del_pho.html |title=Difference between delusion and phobia |date=|accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>
* '''Delusion of poverty''': The person strongly believes that he is financially incapacitated. Although this type of delusion is less common now,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} it was particularly widespread in the days before state support.<ref>Barker, P. 1997. Assessment in Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing In Search of the Whole Person. UK: Nelson Thornes Ltd. P243.</ref>

===Grandiose delusions===
{{main|Grandiose delusions}}
Grandiose delusions are distinct from [[grandiosity]], in that the sufferer does not have [[Insight in psychology and psychiatry|insight]] into his loss of touch with reality. An individual is convinced he has special powers, talents, or abilities. Sometimes, the individual may actually believe they are a famous person or character.

Grandiose delusions or delusions of grandeur are principally a subtype of [[delusional disorder]] but could possibly feature as a symptom of [[schizophrenia]] and [[mania|manic]] episodes of [[Current diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder|bipolar disorder]].<ref name="DSM-IV-TR">[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000)</ref> Grandiose delusions are characterized by fantastical beliefs that one is famous, [[omnipotent]], or otherwise very powerful. The delusions are generally fantastic, often with a [[supernatural]], [[science-fiction]]al, or religious bent. In colloquial usage, one who overestimates one's own abilities, talents, stature or situation is sometimes said to have 'delusions of grandeur'. This is generally due to excessive [[pride]], rather than any actual delusions. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Persecutory delusions===
{{main|Persecutory delusion}}
Persecutory delusions are the most common type of delusions and involve the theme of being followed, harassed, cheated, poisoned or drugged, conspired against, spied on, attacked, or otherwise obstructed in the pursuit of goals.
Persecutory delusions are a condition in which the affected person wrongly believes that they are being [[Persecution|persecuted]]. Specifically, they have been defined as containing two central elements:<ref name="FreemanGarety2004">Freeman, D. & Garety, P.A. (2004) Paranoia: The Psychology of Persecutory Delusions. Hove: PsychoIogy Press. ISBN 1-84169-522-X</ref>{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}
# The individual thinks that harm is occurring, or is going to occur.
# The individual thinks that the persecutor has the intention to cause harm.

According to the [[DSM-IV-TR]], persecutory delusions are the most common form of delusions in [[schizophrenia]], where the person believes they are "being tormented, followed, tricked, spied on, or ridiculed."<ref>{{cite book

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Airloom.gif|thumb|[[John Haslam (physician)|John Haslam]] illustrated this picture of a machine described by [[James Tilly Matthews]] called an "air loom," which Matthews believed was being used to torture him and others for political purposes.]]
The modern definition and Jaspers' original criteria have been criticised, as counter-examples can be shown for every defining feature.

Studies on psychiatric patients show that delusions vary in intensity and conviction over time, which suggests that certainty and incorrigibility are not necessary components of a delusional belief.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Myin-Germeys I, Nicolson NA, Delespaul PA |title=The context of delusional experiences in the daily life of patients with schizophrenia |journal=Psychol Med |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=489–98 |year=2001 |month=April |pmid=11305857 }}</ref>

Delusions do not necessarily have to be false or 'incorrect inferences about external reality'.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-440X(90)90023-L |author=Spitzer M |title=On defining delusions |journal=Compr Psychiatry |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=377–97 |year=1990 |pmid=2225797 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0010-440X(90)90023-L}}<br /></ref> Some religious or spiritual beliefs by their nature may not be falsifiable, and hence cannot be described as false or incorrect, no matter whether the person holding these beliefs was diagnosed as delusional or not.<ref>{{cite book |author=Young, A.W. |chapter=Wondrous strange: The neuropsychology of abnormal beliefs |editor=Coltheart M., Davis M. |title=Pathologies of belief |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=2000 |isbn=0-631-22136-0 |pages=47–74 }}</ref>

In other situations the delusion may turn out to be true belief.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jones E |title=The phenomenology of abnormal belief |journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry and Psychology |volume=6 |pages=1–16 |year=1999 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_psychiatry_and_psychology/toc/ppp6.1.html}}</ref> For example, [[delusional jealousy]], where a person believes that their partner is being unfaithful (and may even follow them into the bathroom believing them to be seeing their lover even during the briefest of partings) may result in the faithful partner being driven to infidelity by the constant and unreasonable strain put on them by their delusional spouse. In this case the delusion does not cease to be a delusion because the content later turns out to be true.

In other cases, the delusion may be assumed to be false by a doctor or psychiatrist assessing the belief, because it ''seems'' to be unlikely, bizarre or held with excessive conviction. Psychiatrists rarely have the time or resources to check the validity of a person’s claims leading to some true beliefs to be erroneously classified as delusional.<ref>{{cite book |author=Maher B.A. |chapter=Anomalous experience and delusional thinking: The logic of explanations |editor=Oltmanns T., Maher B. |title=Delusional Beliefs |publisher=Wiley Interscience |location=New York |year=1988 |isbn=0-471-83635-4 }}</ref> This is known as the [[Martha Mitchell effect]], after the wife of the [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]] who alleged that illegal activity was taking place in the [[White House]]. At the time her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness, and only after the [[Watergate scandal]] broke was she proved right (and hence sane).

Similar factors have led to criticisms of Jaspers' definition of true delusions as being ultimately 'un-understandable'. Critics (such as [[R. D. Laing]]) have argued that this leads to the diagnosis of delusions being based on the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] understanding of a particular psychiatrist, who may not have access to all the information that might make a belief otherwise interpretable. R.D. Laing's hypothesis has been applied to some forms of projective therapy to "fix" a delusional system so that it cannot be altered by the patient. Psychiatric researchers at [[Yale University]], [[Ohio State University]] and the Community Mental Health Center of Middle Georgia have used novels and motion picture films as the focus. Texts, plots and cinematography are discussed and the delusions approached tangentially.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Giannini AJ |title=Use of fiction in therapy |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=56 |year=2001 }}</ref> This use of fiction to decrease the malleability of a delusion was employed in a joint project by science-fiction author [[Philip Jose Farmer]] and Yale psychiatrist A. James Giannini. They wrote the novel ''[[Red Orc's Rage]]'', which, recursively, deals with delusional adolescents who are treated with a form of projective therapy. In this novel's fictional setting other novels written by Farmer are discussed and the characters are symbolically integrated into the delusions of fictional patients.This particular novel was then applied to real-life clinical settings.<ref>AJ Giannini. Afterword. (in) PJ Farmer. Red Orc's Rage.NY, Tor Books, 1991, pp.279-282.</ref>

Another difficulty with the diagnosis of delusions is that almost all of these features can be found in "normal" beliefs. Many religious beliefs hold exactly the same features, yet are not universally considered delusional. These factors have led the psychiatrist [[Anthony David (neuropsychiatrist)|Anthony David]] to note that "there is no acceptable (rather than accepted) definition of a delusion."<ref>{{cite journal |author=David AS |title=On the impossibility of defining delusions |journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry and Psychology |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=17–20 |year=1999 }}</ref> In practice psychiatrists tend to diagnose a belief as delusional if it is either patently bizarre, causing significant distress, or excessively pre-occupies the patient, especially if the person is subsequently unswayed in belief by counter-evidence or reasonable arguments.

It is important to distinguish true delusions from other symptoms such as [[anxiety]], [[fear]], or [[paranoia]]. To diagnose delusions a mental state examination may be used. This test includes [[Human physical appearance|appearance]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], affect, [[behavior]], rate and continuity of speech,evidence of hallucinations or abnormal beliefs, thought content, orientation to time, place and person, attention and [[concentration]], insight and judgment, as well as short-term [[memory]].<ref name="E">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/symptoms/delusions/tests.htm |title=Diagnostic Test List for Delusions |date=|accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>

Johnson-Laird suggests that delusions may be viewed as the natural consequence of failure to distinguish conceptual relevance. That is, the person takes irrelevant information and puts it in the form of disconnected experiences, then it is taken to be relevant in a manner that suggests false causal connections. Furthermore, the person takes the relevant information, in the form of counterexamples, and ignores it.<ref name="F">{{cite web|url=http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/13/3/403-a |title=A New Definition of Delusional Ideation in Terms of Model Restriction|date=|accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>

==Development of specific delusions==
The top two factors mainly concerned in the germination of delusions are: 1. Disorder of brain functioning; and 2. background influences of temperament and personality.<ref>{{cite book |author=Sims, Andrew |title=Symptoms in the mind: an introduction to descriptive psychopathology |publisher=W. B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2002 |pages=127 |isbn=0-7020-2627-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Higher levels of dopamine qualify as a symptom of disorders of brain function. That they are needed to sustain certain delusions was examined by a preliminary study on delusional disorder (a psychotic syndrome) instigated to clarify if schizophrenia had a dopamine psychosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Morimoto K, Miyatake R, Nakamura M, Watanabe T, Hirao T, Suwaki H |title=Delusional disorder: molecular genetic evidence for dopamine psychosis |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=794–801 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12007750 |doi=10.1016/S0893-133X(01)00421-3 |url=http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v26/n6/full/1395864a.html}}</ref> There were positive results - delusions of jealousy and persecution had different levels of dopamine metabolite [[Homovanillic acid|HVA]] and [[Homovanillyl alcohol]] (which may have been genetic). These can be only regarded as tentative results; the study called for future research with a larger population.

It is too simplistic to say that a certain measure of dopamine will bring about a specific delusion. Studies show age<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mazure CM, Bowers MB |title=Pretreatment plasma HVA predicts neuroleptic response in manic psychosis |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=83–6 |date=1 February 1998 |pmid=9495606 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(97)00159-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yamada N, Nakajima S, Noguchi T |title=Age at onset of delusional disorder is dependent on the delusional theme |journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica |volume=97 |issue=2 |pages=122–4 |year=1998 |month=February |pmid=9517905 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1998.tb09973.x }}</ref> and gender to be influential and it is most likely that HVA levels change during the life course of some syndromes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tamplin A, Goodyer IM, Herbert J |title=Family functioning and parent general health in families of adolescents with major depressive disorder |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |date=1 February 1998 |pmid=9495597 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(97)00105-5}}</ref>

On the influence personality, it has been said: "Jaspers considered there is a subtle change in personality due to the illness itself; and this creates the condition for the development of the delusional atmosphere in which the delusional intuition arises."<ref>{{cite book |author=Sims, Andrew |title=Symptoms in the mind: an introduction to descriptive psychopathology |publisher=W. B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2002 |pages=128 |isbn=0-7020-2627-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Cultural factors have "a decisive influence in shaping delusions".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Draguns JG, Tanaka-Matsumi J |title=Assessment of psychopathology across and within cultures: issues and findings |journal=Behav Res Ther |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=755–76 |year=2003 |month=July |pmid=12781244 |doi= 10.1016/S0005-7967(02)00190-0|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0005796702001900}}</ref> For example, delusions of guilt and punishment are frequent in a Western, Christian country like Austria, but not in Pakistan - where it is more likely persecution.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stompe T, Friedman A, Ortwein G, ''et al'' |title=Comparison of delusions among schizophrenics in Austria and in Pakistan |journal=Psychopathology |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=225–34 |year=1999 |pmid=10494061 |doi= 10.1159/000029094|url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&file=psp32225}}</ref> Similarly, in a series of case studies, delusions of guilt and punishment were found in Austrian patients with Parkinson's being treated with l-dopa - a dopamine agonist.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Birkmayer W, Danielczyk W, Neumayer E, Riederer P |title=The balance of biogenic amines as condition for normal behaviour |journal=J.

==Causes==
{{See also|Psychosis#Causes|l1=Psychosis (causes)}}
To define delusional thinking in a specific patient, it is important to consult a local psychiatrist who can make a thorough examination before diagnosing the problem.<ref name="G">{{cite web|url=http://www.delusional.com/ |title=Delusional Disorder Definition |date=|accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref> Explaining the causes of delusions continues to be challenging and several theories have been developed. One is the [[Genetics|genetic]] or biological theory, which states that close relatives of people with delusional disorder are at increased risk of delusional traits. Another theory is the dysfunctional cognitive processing, which states that delusions may arise from distorted ways people have of explaining life to themselves. A third theory is called motivated or defensive delusions. This one states that some of those persons who are predisposed might suffer the onset of delusional disorder in those moments when coping with life and maintaining high [[self-esteem]] becomes a significant challenge. In this case, the person views others as the cause of their personal difficulties in order to preserve a positive self-view.<ref name="H">{{cite web|url=http://www.minddisorders.com/Br-Del/Delusional-disorder.html |title=Delusional Disorder |date=|accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>

This condition is more common among people who have poor [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] or [[Visual perception|sight]]. Also, ongoing stressors have been associated with a higher possibility of developing delusions. Examples of such stressors are [[immigration]] or low socio-economic status.<ref name="I">{{cite web|url=http://www.depression-treatment-help.com/mental-disorders/delusional-disorder.htm |title=Causes of Delusional Disorder |date=|accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>

Researcher, Orrin Devinsky, MD, from the NYU Langone Medical Center, performed a study that revealed a consistent [[pattern]] of injury to the [[frontal lobe]] and right hemisphere of the [[human brain]] in patients with certain delusions and brain disorders. Devinsky explains that the cognitive deficits caused by those injuries to the right hemisphere, results in the over compensation by the left hemisphere of the brain for the injury, which causes delusions.<ref name="J">{{cite web|url=http://machineslikeus.com/news/what-causes-delusions |title=What causes delusions? |date=|accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>

A study carried out by a team from The Warwick Medical School at the [[University of Warwick]], Coventry, England, led by Andrea Schreier, Ph. D., indicated that [[children]] who suffered [[bullying]] are more likely to develop psychotic symptoms in early [[adolescence]]. The background facts demonstrated that hallucinations and delusions are common in childhood as well as in adulthood and that children who experience such symptoms are more prone to develop psychosis later in life. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that the risk of psychotic symptoms, including delusions, was multiplied by two for children who suffered bullying at age eight or ten. The authors remark that bullying can cause [[chronic stress]] that may have an effect on a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia and result in setting off the symptoms.<ref name="K">{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/149130.php |title=Children Who Suffered Bullying Are More Likely To Develop Psychotic Symptoms In Early Adolescence |date=|accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>
