'''Transient global amnesia''' (TGA) is a syndrome in clinical neurology whose key defining characteristic is a temporary but almost total disruption of short-term memory with a range of problems accessing older memories.  A person in a state of TGA exhibits no other signs of impaired [[cognitive function]]ing but recalls only the last few moments of consciousness plus deeply encoded facts of the individual’s past, such as his or her own name.<ref name= Logan1983>{{cite journal |pmid=6658982 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/14/6/1005 |journal=Stroke |title=Transient global amnesia |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=1005–7 |author=Logan, W |first2=D |year=1983 |last2=Sherman |doi=10.1161/01.STR.14.6.1005}}</ref><ref name=Hodges&Warlow1990b>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.53.10.834 |pmid=2266362 |year=1990 |author1=Hodges |first2=CP |title=Syndromes of transient amnesia: towards a classification.

==Symptoms==
A person having an attack of TGA has almost no capacity to establish new memories, but generally appears otherwise mentally alert and lucid,  possessing full knowledge of self-identity and identity of close family, and maintaining  intact perceptual skills  and a wide repertoire of complex learned behavior. The individual simply cannot recall anything that happened outside the last few minutes, while memory for more temporally distant events may or may not be largely intact.<ref name= Logan1983/><ref name=Hodges&Warlow1990b/> The degree of amnesia is profound, and, in the interval during which the individual is aware of his or her condition, is often accompanied by anxiety.<ref name= Noel>{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.107.045716 |title=Psychopathological factors, memory disorders and transient global amnesia |year=2008 |last1=Noel |first1=A. |first2=P. |first3=B. |first4=J. |first5=P. |first6=S. |first7=V. |first8=F. |first9=B. |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=193 |pages=145–51 |pmid=18670000 |issue=2 |last2=Quinette |last3=Guillery-Girard |last4=Dayan |last5=Piolino |last6=Marquis |last7=De La Sayette |last8=Viader |last9=Desgranges}}</ref>
The diagnostic criteria for TGA, as defined for purposes of clinical research, include:<ref name=Hodges&Warlow1990b/>
* The attack was witnessed by a capable observer and reported as being a definite loss of recent memory ([[anterograde amnesia]]).
* There was an absence of clouding of consciousness or other cognitive impairment other than amnesia.
* There were no focal neurological signs or deficits during or after the attack.
* There were no features of [[epilepsy]], or active epilepsy in the past two years, and the patient did not have any recent head injury.
* The attack resolved within 24 hours.

===Progression of a TGA event===
This onset of TGA is generally fairly rapid, and its duration varies but generally lasts between 2 to 8 hours.<ref name=Hodges&Warlow1990b/> A person experiencing TGA typically has memory only of the past few minutes or less, and cannot retain new information beyond that period of time. One of its bizarre features is perseverance, in which the victim of an attack faithfully and methodically repeats statements or questions, complete with profoundly identical intonation and gestures "as if a fragment of a sound track is being repeatedly rerun."<ref name=Frederiks>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0303-8467(93)90102-M |title=Transient global amnesia |year=1993 |last1=Frederiks |first1=J |journal=Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery |volume=95 |pages=265–83 |pmid=8299284 |issue=4}}</ref> This is found in almost all TGA attacks and is sometimes considered a defining characteristic of the condition.<ref name=Hodges&Warlow1990b/><ref name=Butler2008>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/brain/awn127 |title=Recent insights into the impairment of memory in epilepsy: transient epileptic amnesia, accelerated long-term forgetting and remote memory impairment |year=2008 |last1=Butler |first1=C.

There is emerging evidence for observable impairments in a minority of cases weeks or even years following a TGA attack.<ref name=Guillery-Girard/><ref name=Nakada>{{cite journal |doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000156158.48587.EA  |pmid=15824342 |year=2005 |author1=Nakada |first2=IL |first3=Y |first4=RT |title=High-field, T2 reversed MRI of the hippocampus in transient global amnesia |volume=64 |issue=7 |pages=1170–4 |journal=Neurology |last2=Kwee |last3=Fujii |last4=Knight}}</ref><ref name=Kessler2001>{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/00207450109149746 |title=Continuing Cognitive Impairment After Isolated Transient Global Amnesia |year=2001 |last1=Kessler |first1=Josef |first2=Hans |first3=Jobst |first4=Wolf-Dieter |journal=International Journal of Neuroscience |volume=106 |pages=159–68 |pmid=11264917 |issue=3–4 |last2=Markowitsch |last3=Rudolf |last4=Heiss|authorlink2 = Hans Markowitsch}}</ref>

There is also evidence that the victim is aware that something is not quite right, even though they can't pinpoint it. The person suffering from the attack may vocalize signs that 'they just lost their memory', or that they believed they had a stroke, although they aren't aware of the other signs that they are displaying. The main sign of this condition is the repetitive actions of something that is not usually repeated.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

If the event lasts less than one hour, [[transient epileptic amnesia]] (TEA) might be implicated.<ref name=Hodges&Warlow1990b/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Engmann |first1=Birk |last2=Reuter |first2=Mike |title=A case history of sudden memory dysfunction – caused by transient epileptic amnesia |journal=Aktuelle Neurologie |year=2003 |volume=30 |pages=350–353 |doi=10.1055/s-2003-41889 |issue=7}}</ref>

If the condition lasts longer than 24 hours, it is not considered TGA by definition.  A diagnostic investigation would then probably focus on some form of undetected ischemic attack or cranial bleed.<ref name=Landres2003/><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11764138 |year=2000 |author1=Monzani |first2=A |first3=G |first4=V |title=Transient global amnesia or subarachnoid haemorrhage?

==Causes==
The underlying cause of TGA remains enigmatic. 
The leading hypotheses are some form of epileptic event, a problem with blood circulation around, to or from the brain, or some kind of migraine-like phenomenon.<ref name=Hodges&Warlow1990a/><ref name= Enzinger2008>{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.508655 |title=Transient Global Amnesia: Diffusion-Weighted Imaging Lesions and Cerebrovascular Disease |year=2008 |last1=Enzinger |first1=C. |first2=F. |first3=P. |first4=S. |first5=R. |first6=F. |first7=F. |journal=Stroke |volume=39 |pages=2219–25 |pmid=18583561 |issue=8 |last2=Thimary |last3=Kapeller |last4=Ropele |last5=Schmidt |last6=Ebner |last7=Fazekas}}</ref><ref name=Bauer2005>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/qjmed/hci060 |title=Transient global amnesia or transient epileptic amnesia? |year=2005 |last1=Bauer |first1=G. |journal=QJM |volume=98 |pages=383; author reply 383–4 |pmid=15833772 |first2=T |first3=I |first4=E |first5=E |issue=5 |last2=Benke |last3=Unterberger |last4=Schmutzhard |last5=Trinka}}</ref><ref name=Zorzon1995>{{cite journal |pmid=7660394 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/9/1536 |journal=Stroke |title=Transient Global Amnesia and Transient Ischemic Attack : Natural History, Vascular Risk Factors, and Associated Conditions |volume=26 |issue=9 |pages=1536–42 |author=Zorzon, Marino |first2=L |first3=G |first4=E |first5=B |first6=G |year=1995 |last2=Antonutti |last3=Masè |last4=Biasutti |last5=Vitrani |last6=Cazzato |doi=10.1161/01.STR.26.9.1536}}</ref>
The differences are sufficiently meaningful that transient amnesia may be considered a heterogeneous clinical syndrome<ref name=Hodges&Warlow1990b/> with multiple etiologies, corresponding mechanisms, and differing prognoses.<ref name=Quinette2006/> Another widely disputed cause of TGA is excessive contact with bleach products. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Precipitating events===
TGA attacks are associated with some form of precipitating event in at least one-third of cases.<ref name=Miller1987>{{cite journal |pmid=3574671 |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/37/5/733 |journal=Neurology |title=Transient global amnesia: Clinical characteristics and prognosis |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=733–7 |author=Miller, J. W. |first2=R |first3=E |first4=C |first5=T |year=1987 |last2=Petersen |last3=Metter |last4=Millikan |last5=Yanagihara}}</ref> In females, this event is more often of a strong emotional character; in males, it is more often related to some physical exertion.<ref name=Quinette2006/> The most commonly cited precipitating events include vigorous exercise (including sexual intercourse), swimming in cold water or enduring other temperature changes, and emotionally traumatic or stressful events.<ref name=Hodges&Warlow1990b/> There are reports of TGA-like conditions following certain medical procedures and disease states.<ref name=Bauer2005/> There is a slight (2%) familial incidence.<ref name=Hodges&Warlow1990b/>

If the definition of a precipitating event is widened to include events days or weeks earlier, and to take in emotionally stressful burdens such as money worries, attending a funeral or exhaustion due to overwork or unusual childcare responsibilities, a large majority, over 80%, of TGA attacks are said to correlate with precipitating events.<ref name=Quinette2006/>

The role of psychological co-factors has been addressed by some research. It is the case that people in a state of TGA exhibit measurably elevated levels of anxiety and/or depression.<ref name=Noel/> Emotional instability may leave some people vulnerable to stressful triggers and thus be associated with TGA.<ref name=Quinette2006/> Individuals who have experienced TGA, compared with similar people with TIA, are more likely to have some kind of emotional problem (such as depression or phobias) in their personal or family history<ref name=Pantoni2005>{{cite journal |pmid=15804264 |year=2005 |author1=Pantoni |first2=E |first3=M |first4=G |first5=D |title=Clinical features, risk factors, and prognosis in transient global amnesia: a follow-up study |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=350–6 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-1331.2004.00982.x |journal=European Journal of Neurology |last2=Bertini |last3=Lamassa |last4=Pracucci |last5=Inzitari}}</ref> or to have experienced some kind of phobic or emotionally challenging precipitating event.<ref name=Inzitari>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archneur.1997.00550190056015  |pmid=9236576 |year=1997 |author1=Inzitari |first2=L |first3=M |first4=S |first5=G |first6=P |title=Emotional arousal and phobia in transient global amnesia |volume=54 |issue=7 |pages=866–73 |journal=Archives of neurology |last2=Pantoni |last3=Lamassa |last4=Pallanti |last5=Pracucci |last6=Marini}}</ref>

===Vascular hypotheses===
[[Cerebral ischemia]] is a frequently disputed possible cause, at least for some segment of the TGA population, and until the 1990s it was generally thought that TGA was a variant of [[transient ischemic attack]] (TIA) secondary to some form of cerebrovascular disease.<ref name= Hodges&Warlow1990a/><ref name=Zorzon1995/> Those who argue against a vascular cause point to evidence that those experiencing TGA are no more likely than the general population to have subsequent [[cerebral vascular disease]].<ref name= Hodges&Warlow1990a/> In fact, "in comparison with TIA patients, TGA patients had a significantly lower risk of combined stroke, [[myocardial infarct]], and death."<ref name=Pantoni2005/>

Other vascular origins remain a possibility, however, according to research of jugular vein valve insufficiency in patients with TGA. In these cases, mostly men, TGA has followed vigorous exertion. One current hypothesis is that TGA may be due to [[venous]] [[:wikt:congestion|congestion]] of the brain,<ref name=lewis1998>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)01442-1 |title=Aetiology of transient global amnesia |year=1998 |last1=Lewis |first1=S |journal=The Lancet |volume=352 |issue=9125 |pages=397–9 | pmid=9717945}}</ref> leading to [[ischemia]] of structures involved with memory, such as the [[hippocampus]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000219620.69618.9d |title=Detection of intracranial venous reflux in patients of transient global amnesia |year=2006 |last1=Chung |first1=C. -P. |journal=Neurology |volume=66 |pages=1873–7 |pmid=16801653 |first2=HY |first3=AC |first4=FC |first5=WY |first6=HH |issue=12 |last2=Hsu |last3=Chao |last4=Chang |last5=Sheng |last6=Hu}}</ref>  It has been shown that performing a [[Valsalva maneuver]] (involving ""bearing down"" and increasing breath pressure against a closed glottis, which occurs frequently during exertion) may be related to retrograde flow of blood in the jugular vein, and therefore, presumably, cerebral blood circulation, in patients with TGA.<ref name=lewis1998/><ref name=Sander&Sander2005>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70121-6 |title=New insights into transient global amnesia: recent imaging and clinical findings |year=2005 |last1=Sander |first1=Kerstin |first2=Dirk |journal=The Lancet Neurology |volume=4 |page=437 |last2=Sander |issue=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8681172 |year=1996 |author1=Moreno-lugris |first2=J |first3=F |first4=F |first5=JA |title=Transient global amnesia.

===Migraine===
A history of [[migraine]] is a statistically significant risk factor identified in the medical literature.<ref name= Hodges&Warlow1990a/><ref name=Quinette2006/> "When comparing TGA patients with normal control subjects… the only factor significantly associated with an increased risk for TGA was migraine."<ref name=Zorzon1995/> 14% of people with TGA had a history of migraine in one study,<ref name=Miller1987/> and approximately a third of the participants in another clinical study reported such a history.<ref name=Hodges&Warlow1990b/>

However, migraine does not appear to occur simultaneously with TGA nor serve as a precipitating event. Headache frequently occurs during TGA, as does nausea, both symptoms often associated with migraine, but it appears that these do not indicate migraine in patients during a TGA event. The connection remains conceptual, and muddied further by a lack of consensus about the definition of migraine itself, and by the differences in age, gender, and psychological characteristics of migraine sufferers when compared to those variables in the TGA cohort.<ref name=Quinette2006/>

===Epilepsy===
Amnesia is often a symptom in [[epilepsy]], and for that reason people with known epilepsy are disqualified from most studies of TGA.  In a study where strict criteria were applied to TGA diagnosis, no epileptic features were seen in EEGs of over 100 patients with TGA.<ref name=Quinette2006/> However, despite the fact that [[EEG]] readings are usually normal during a TGA attack, and other usual symptoms of epilepsy are not observed with TGA <ref name=Zorzon1995/> it has been speculated that some initial epileptic attacks present as TGA.<ref name=Hodges&Warlow1990b/> The observation that 7% of people who experience TGA will develop epilepsy calls into question whether those case are, in fact, TGA or [[transient epileptic amnesia]] (TEA).<ref name= Hodges&Warlow1990a/> TEA attacks tend to be short (under one hour) and tend to recur, so that a person who has experienced both repeated attacks of temporary amnesia resembling TGA and if those events lasted less than one hour is very likely to develop epilepsy.<ref name=Hodges&Warlow1990b/>

There is additional speculation that atypical cases of TEA in the form of nonconvulsive [[status epilepticus]] may present with duration similar to TGA.<ref name= Vuilleumier1996>{{cite journal |pmid=8780086 |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/46/4/1036 |journal=Neurology |title=Failure to recall (but not to remember): Pure transient amnesia during nonconvulsive status epilepticus |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=1036–9 |author=Vuilleumier, P. |first2=P |first3=F |year=1996 |last2=Despland |last3=Regli}}</ref> This may constitute a distinct subgroup of TGA.
TEA, as opposed to "pure" TGA, is also characterized by "two unusual forms of memory deficit …: (i) accelerated long-term forgetting (ALF): the excessively rapid loss of newly acquired memories over a period of days or weeks and (ii) remote autobiographical memory loss: a loss of memories for salient, personally experienced events of the past few decades."<ref name=Butler2008/>

Whether an amnestic event is TGA or TEA thus presents a diagnostic challenge,<ref name=Bauer2005/> especially in light of the recently published descriptions of possible long-term cognitive deficits with (presumably correctly diagnosed) TGA.

===Other putative associations===
There have been assertions of a possible link between TGA and the use of [[statin]]s (a class of drug used in treating cholesterol).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bcr.06.2008.0033 |title=Transient global amnesia associated with statin intake |year=2009 |last1=Healy |first1=D. |first2=R. |first3=S. |journal=Case Reports |volume=2009 |pages=bcr0620080033 |last2=Morgan |last3=Chinnaswamy}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Duane |last=Graveline |title=Statins and Amnesia |url=http://www.spacedoc.net/statin_amnesia_true_cost.html |accessdate=19 October 2009}}{{Verify credibility|date=October 2009}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The prognosis of "pure" TGA is very good. It does not affect mortality or morbidity<ref name=Sucholeiki20081203/> and unlike earlier understanding of the condition, TGA is not a risk factor for stroke or ischemic disease.<ref name= Hodges&Warlow1990a/> Rates of recurrence are variously reported, with one systematic calculation suggesting the rate is under 6% per year.<ref name=Pantoni2005/>  TGA “is universally felt to be a benign condition which requires no further treatment other than reassurance to the patient and their family.” <ref name=Landres2003>Landres B: UCLA Department of Medicine Clinical Vignette: Transient Global Amnesia. Last Revised: Sun, 13-Apr-2003. http://www.med.ucla.edu/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=38 accessed 9/26/09</ref> 
"The most important part of management after diagnosis is looking after the psychological needs of the patient and his or her relatives. Seeing a once competent and healthy partner, sibling or parent become incapable of remembering what was said only a minute ago is very distressing, and hence it is often the relatives who will require reassurance." <ref name="TGA">{{cite journal| journal=Emerg Med J| author=Magnus Harrison and Mark Williams 
|title=The diagnosis and management of transient global amnesia in the emergency department |volume=24 |pages=444–445 |year=2007 |doi=10.1136/emj.2007.046565| pmid=17513554| issue=6| pmc=2658295}}</ref>

TGA may have multiple etiologies and prognoses.<ref name=Quinette2006/> Atypical presentations may masquerade as epilepsy<ref name= Hodges&Warlow1990a/> and be more properly considered TEA. In addition to such probable TEA cases, some people experiencing amnestic events diverging from the diagnostic criteria articulated above may have a less benign prognosis than those with "pure" TGA.<ref name=Hodges&Warlow1990b/>

Recently, moreover, both imaging and neurocognitive testing studies question whether TGA is as benign as has been thought.  MRI scans of the brain in one study showed that among people who had experienced TGA, all had cavities in the hippocampus, and these cavities were far more numerous, larger, and more suggestive of pathological damage than in either healthy controls or a large control group of people with tumor or stroke.<ref name=Nakada/> Verbal and cognitive impairments have been observed days after TGA attacks, of such severity that the researchers estimated the effects would be unlikely to resolve within a short time frame.<ref name=Kessler2001/> A large neurocognitive study of patients more than a year after their attacks has shown persistent effects consistent with amnestic [[mild cognitive impairment]] (MCI-a) in a third of the people who had experienced TGA.<ref name=Borroni>{{cite journal |pmid=15372257 |year=2004 |author1=Borroni |first2=C |first3=C |first4=V |first5=E |first6=N |first7=A |title=Is transient global amnesia a risk factor for amnestic mild cognitive impairment? |volume=251 |issue=9 |pages=1125–7 |doi=10.1007/s00415-004-0497-x |journal=Journal of neurology |last2=Agosti |last3=Brambilla |last4=Vergani |last5=Cottini |last6=Akkawi |last7=Padovani}}</ref> In another study, "selective cognitive dysfunctions after the clinical recovery" were observed, suggesting a prefrontal impairment.<ref name=LePira2005/> These dysfunctions  may not be in memory ''per se'' but in retrieval, in which speed of access is part of the problem among people who have had TGA and experience ongoing memory problems.<ref name=Guillery-Girard/>

Recently, it has been shown that observation of  amateur [[soccer]]   has been positively correlated with full recovery in patients who experienced TGA. <ref name=Miller1987/>

== Epidemiology ==
The estimated annual incidence of TGA varies from a minimum of 2.9 cases per 100,000 population (in Spain) and 5.2 per 100,000 (in USA),<ref name=Sucholeiki20081203/> but among people aged over 50, the rate of TGA incidence is  reported to range from approximately 23 per 100,000 (in a US population) to 32 per 100,000 (in a population in Scandinavia).<ref name=Miller1987/><ref name=Koski>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0404.1990.tb01571.x |pmid=2360405 |year=1990 |author1=Koski |first2=RJ |title=Transient global amnesia: incidence in an urban population |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=358–60 |journal=Acta neurologica Scandinavica |last2=Marttila}}</ref>

TGA is most common in people between age 56 and 75,<ref name=Quinette2006/> with the average age of a person experiencing TGA being approximately 62.<ref name=Hodges&Warlow1990a/>
