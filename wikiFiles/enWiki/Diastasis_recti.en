'''Diastasis recti''' (also known as '''abdominal separation''') is a disorder defined as a separation of the [[rectus abdominis muscle]] into right and left halves.<ref name=MedlinePlus>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001602.htm MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Diastasis Recti]</ref> Normally, the two sides of the muscle are joined at the [[Linea alba (abdomen)|linea alba]] at the body midline.  It is essentially a [[cosmetic surgery|cosmetic]] condition, with no associated morbidity or mortality.<ref name="Norton, Jeffrey A. 2003 350">{{cite book |author=Norton, Jeffrey A. |title=Essential practice of surgery: basic science and clinical evidence |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2003 |pages=350 |isbn=0-387-95510-0}}</ref>

Diastasis of this muscle occurs principally in two populations: [[Infant|newborns]] and [[Pregnancy|pregnant women]]. 

* In the newborn, the rectus abdominis is not fully developed and may not be sealed together at midline. Diastasis recti is more common in [[Premature birth|premature]] and [[black]] newborns.
* In pregnant or [[Postnatal|postpartum]] women, the defect is caused by the stretching of the rectus abdominis by the growing uterus. It is more common in [[Parity (medicine)|multiparous]] women due to repeated episodes of stretching. When the defect occurs during pregnancy, the uterus can sometimes be seen bulging through the abdominal wall beneath the skin.<ref name=MedlinePlus/>

==Presentation==
A diastasis recti may appear as a ridge running down the midline of the abdomen, anywhere from the [[xiphoid process]] to the [[Navel|umbilicus]]. It becomes more prominent with straining and may disappear when the abdominal muscles are relaxed. The medial borders of the right and left halves of the muscle may be palpated during contraction of the rectus abdominis.<ref>[http://www.pennhealth.com/ency/article/001602.htm University of Pennsylvania Health System Encyclopedia: Diastasis Recti]</ref> The condition can be diagnosed by physical exam, and must be differentiated from an [[epigastric hernia]] or [[incisional hernia]], if the patient has had abdominal surgery.<ref name="Norton, Jeffrey A. 2003 350"/>  Hernias may be ruled out using ultrasound.

In infants, they typically result from a minor defect of the [[Linea alba (abdomen)|linea alba]] between the [[rectus abdominis]] muscles. This allows tissue from inside the abdomen to herniate anteriorly. On infants, this may manifest as an apparent 'bubble' under the skin of the belly between the [[Navel|umbilicus]] and [[xiphisternum]] (bottom of the breastbone).

==Treatment==
No treatment is necessary for women while they are still pregnant. In children, complications include development of an [[Umbilical hernia|umbilical]] or ventral hernia, which is rare and can be corrected with surgery.<ref name=MedlinePlus/>

In adults, diastasis recti can in some cases be corrected and/or mitigated by physiotherapy. A study conducted at Columbia University Program in Physical Therapy established that the women utilizing the Tupler Technique exercises had a smaller diastasis than the control group who did not do these exercises.<ref>Journal of Women's Health Physical Therapy Volume 29, No. 1, Spring, 2005</ref>

In extreme cases, diastasis recti is corrected during the [[cosmetic surgery]] procedure known as a [[tummy tuck]] by creating a plication or folding of the linea alba and suturing together. This creates a tighter abdominal wall.

In adult females, a laparoscopic Venetian blind technique can be used for plication of the recti.<ref>Laparoscopic repair of diastasis recti using the 'Venetian blinds' technique of plication with prosthetic reinforcement: a retrospective study
