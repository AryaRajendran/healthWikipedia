'''Sangassou virus''' is a species of the genus [[Hantavirus|hantavirus]] in the [[Bunyaviridae]] family. It was first isolated in an [[Murinae|African wood mouse]] in the forest in [[Guinea]], [[West Africa]] in 2010. It is named for the village near where the mouse was trapped. <ref>Strecker, T.; Ter Meulen, J. et al. (2012). "Sangassou Virus, the First Hantavirus Isolate from Africa, Displays Genetic and Functional Properties Distinct from Those of Other Murinae-Associated Hantaviruses". Journal of Virology 86 (7): 3819â€“3827. doi:10.1128/JVI.05879-11. PMC 3302504. PMID 22278233.</ref>

== Genetics == 

The virus genome consists of three segments of negative-stranded RNA; the large (L) segment encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the medium (M) segment encodes the envelope glycoproteins Gn and Gc (cotranslationally cleaved from a glycoprotein precursor), and the small (S) segment encodes the nucleocapsid (N) protein.<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22278233 |title=Sangassou virus, the first hantavirus isolate from A...

== Renal syndrome ==
In rodents, hantavirus produces a chronic infection with no adverse sequelae. In humans, hantavirus produces two major clinical syndromes: hemorrhagic fever or pulmonary syndrome. European, Asian, and African rodent-borne hantaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever. The pulmonary syndrome, caused by the species [[Sin Nombre virus]], has not been found anywhere other than the United States where [[Deer mouse|deer mice]] are the natural hosts. It was discovered in 1993 during an [[1993 Four Corners hantavirus outbreak|outbreak]] in the [[Four Corners]] region of the southwestern United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/hfrs/index.html |title=CDC - Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) - Hantavirus |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=2011-05-17 |accessdate=2013-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/10073292/reload=0;jsessionid=hqD8dPnZVxFkZhZzWZxH.10 |title=Spectrum of hantavirus infection: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus... - Abstract - Europe PubMed Central |publisher=Europepmc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13}}</ref>

== Reservoirs == 

Natural reservoirs for this hantavirus species include the split faced bat, moles, and shrews. Rodent-borne hantaviruses form three major evolutionary clades corresponding to the subfamilies of their rodent hosts. HTNV, SEOV, and DOBV are examples of Murinae-associated hantaviruses. PUUV and Tula virus (TULV) belong to the Arvicolinae-associated hantaviruses, and SNV and ANDV are representatives of Neotominae- and Sigmodontinae-associated hantaviruses.<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3302504/ |title=Sangassou Virus, the First Hantavirus Isolate from Africa, Displays Genetic and Functional Properties Distinct from Those of Other Murinae-Associated Hantaviruses |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2725914/ |title=Novel Hantavirus Sequences in Shrew, Guinea |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=2013-03-25 |accessdate=2013-04-17}}</ref>
