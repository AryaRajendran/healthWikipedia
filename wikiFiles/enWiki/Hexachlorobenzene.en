'''Hexachlorobenzene''', or '''perchlorobenzene''', is a [[organochloride|chlorocarbon]] with the molecular formula C<sub>6</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>. It is a [[fungicide]] formerly used as a seed treatment, especially on wheat to control the fungal disease [[karnal bunt|bunt]]. It has been banned globally under the [[Stockholm Convention]] on [[persistent organic pollutants]].<ref>[http://www.pops.int/documents/pops/default.htm Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants website]</ref> 

==Physical and chemical properties==
HCB is a white crystalline solid that has negligible solubility in water (0.00000002 M) and variable solubility in different organic solvents. It is most soluble in halogenated solvents like [[chloroform]] (approx 0.03 M) less soluble in esters and hydrocarbons ((approx 0.020 M), and even less soluble in short chain alcohols (0.002-0.006 M).  Its vapour pressure is 1.09×10<sup>−5</sup> mmHg (1.45 mPa) at 20 °C.  Its flash point is 242 °C and it sublimes at 322 °C.

==Safety==
Hexachlorobenzene is an animal [[carcinogen]] and is considered to be a probable human carcinogen.<ref name="carcinogens">{{PDF|[http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/eleventh/profiles/s093hexa.pdf Report on Carcinogens, Eleventh Edition]|208&nbsp;KB}}</ref> After its introduction as a fungicide in 1945, for crop seeds, this toxic chemical was found in all food types{{Fact|date=May 2009}}. Hexachlorobenzene was banned from use in the United States in 1966.

This material has been classified by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) as a [[List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens|Group 2B carcinogen]] (possibly carcinogenic to humans). Animal carcinogenicity data for hexachlorobenzene show increased incidences of [[liver cancer|liver]], [[kidney cancer|kidney]] (renal tubular tumours) and [[thyroid cancer]]s.<ref name="berkeley">{{cite web | title=Hexachlorobenzene | publisher=The Carcinogenic Potency Database Project | url=http://potency.berkeley.edu/chempages/HEXACHLOROBENZENE.html | accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref> Chronic oral exposure in humans has been shown to give rise to a liver disease ([[porphyria cutanea tarda]]), skin lesions with discoloration, [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulceration]], [[photosensitivity]], thyroid effects, bone effects and loss of hair. Neurological changes have been reported in rodents exposed to hexachlorobenzene. Hexachlorobenzene may cause embryolethality and [[teratogenic]] effects. Human and animal studies have demonstrated that hexachlorobenzene crosses the placenta to accumulate in foetal tissues and is transferred in breast milk.

HCB is very toxic to [[aquatic organisms]]. It may cause long term adverse effects in the aquatic [[Ecosystem|environment]]. Therefore, release into waterways should be avoided. It is persistent in the environment. Ecological investigations have found that [[biomagnification]] up the food chain does occur. Hexachlorobenzene has a half life in the soil of between 3 and 6 years.  Risk of bioaccumulation in an aquatic species is high.

===Toxicology===
* Oral LD50 (rat): 10,000&nbsp;mg/kg
* Oral LD50 (mice): 4,000&nbsp;mg/kg
* Inhalation LC50 (rat): 3600&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>
Material has relatively low acute toxicity but is toxic because of its persistent and cumulative nature in body tissues in rich lipid content{{Fact|date=May 2009}}.

===Unique Exposure Incident===
In [[Anatolia]], Turkey between 1955 and 1959, during a period when bread wheat was unavailable, 500 people were fatally poisoned and more than 4,000 people fell ill by eating bread made with HCB-treated seed that was intended for agriculture use. Most of the sick were affected with a liver condition called [[porphyria cutanea tarda]], which disturbs the metabolism of hemoglobin and results in skin lesions. Almost all breastfeeding children under the age of two, whose mothers had eaten tainted bread, died from a condition called "pembe yara" or "pink sore," most likely from high doses of HCB in the breast milk.<ref>Natural Resources Defense Council (2001). Healthy Milk, Healthy Baby: Chemical Pollution and Mother's Milk. Retrieved September 13, 2008 from the World Wide Web: http://www.nrdc.org/breastmilk/chem4.asp</ref> In one mother's breast milk the HCB level was found to be 20 parts per million in lipid, approximately 2,000 times the average levels of contamination found in breast-milk samples around the world.<ref>Jensen, A.A. and S.A.

In the same follow-up study of 252 patients (162 males and 90 females, avg. current age of 35.7 years), 20–30 years postexposure, many subjects had dermatologic, neurologic, and orthopedic symptoms and signs. The observed clinical findings include scarring of the face and hands (83.7%), hyperpigmentation (65%), hypertrichosis (44.8%), pinched faces (40.1%), painless arthritis (70.2%), small hands (66.6%), sensory shading (60.6%), myotonia (37.9%), cogwheeling (41.9%), enlarged thyroid (34.9%), and enlarged liver (4.8%). Urine and stool porphyrin levels were determined in all patients, and 17 have at least one of the porphyrins elevated. Offspring of mothers with three decades of HCB-induced porphyria appear normal.<ref name="Gocmen"/>
