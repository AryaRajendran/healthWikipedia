A '''retrospective cohort study''', also called a '''historic cohort study''', (from Latin retr, "look back") generally means to take a look back at events that already have taken place. For example, the term is used in medicine, describing a look back at a patient's medical history or lifestyle. Retrospective cohort studies have existed for approximately as long as [[prospective cohort studies]].<ref>http://www.epidemiology.ch/history/papers/doll-paper2.pdf</ref>

==Design==
It is a [[medical research]] study in which the [[medical records]] of groups of individuals who are alike in many ways but differ by a certain characteristic (for example, female nurses who smoke and those who do not smoke) are compared for a particular [[outcome]] (such as [[lung cancer]]).<ref name="urlDefinition of historic cohort study - NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=286525|title=Definition of historic cohort study - NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> In retrospective cohort studies, a [[risk ratio]] or [[odds ratio]] gives an assessment of [[relative risk]].<ref name="statsdirect.com">http://www.statsdirect.com/help/basics/prospective.htm</ref>

In the case of a retrospective cohort study, the investigator collects data from past records and does not follow patients up as is the case with a prospective study. ''However, the starting point of this study is the same as for all cohort studies.'' The first objective is still to establish two groups - exposed versus non-exposed; and these groups are followed up in the ensuing time period. 

In a nutshell, in Retrospective Cohort Study, all the events - exposure, latent period, and subsequent outcome (ex. development of disease) have already occurred in the past. We merely collect the data now, and establish the risk of developing a disease if exposed to a particular risk factor. On the other hand, Prospective Cohort Study is conducted by starting with two groups at the current point, and following up in future for occurrence of disease, if any.

It is important to understand that the methodology of prospective and retrospective cohort studies is fundamentally the same, but the retrospective study is performed post-hoc, as the cohort is followed retrospectively. The time to complete a retrospective study is only as long as it takes to collect and interpret the data.<ref>http://emj.bmj.com/content/20/1/54.full</ref> Retrospective studies examine possible risk and protection variables in relation to a result that is already established at the start of the study.<ref name="statsdirect.com"/>

Caution needs to be exercised in particular with retrospective cohort studies because errors due to confounding and bias are more common in retrospective studies than in prospective studies.<ref name="statsdirect.com"/>

==Advantages==
Retrospective cohort studies, do have distinct advantages as well when compared with prospective cohort studies, including the smaller scale which retrospective studies often entail.<ref name="medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com"/> Another key benefit of retrospective cohort studies is that they typically require less time to complete.<ref name="medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com"/> Another chief advantage is that retrospective studies are better for analysing multiple outcomes.<ref name="ocw.tufts.edu"/> And one of the biggest benefits to a retrospective study in a medical context is its ability to address rare diseases, which would necessitate extremely large cohorts in prospective studies.<ref name="medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com"/> In such a study, diseased people have already been identified, so retrospective studies are especially helpful in addressing diseases of low incidence.<ref>http://www.fao.org/Wairdocs/ILRI/x5436E/x5436e06.htm</ref> The fact that retrospective studies are generally less expensive than prospective studies also can be a key benefit.<ref name="ocw.tufts.edu"/> These studies tend to be less expensive in part because outcome and exposure have already occurred, and the resources are mainly directed at collection of data only.<ref name="ocw.tufts.edu"/> Additionally, it has essentially all the benefits of a [[Cohort Study (Statistics)]]

==Disadvantages==
Retrospective studies have disadvantages vis-a-vis prospective studies. Among the disadvantages are that some key statistics cannot be measured, and significant biases may affect the selection of controls.<ref name="medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com">http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/retrospective+study</ref> Additionally, major biases with retrospective cohort studies can impact the recall of former exposure to risk variables.<ref name="medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com"/> Among the biases which can negatively impact the veracity of this type of study are [[selection bias]] and misclassification or [[information bias]] as a result of the retrospective aspect.<ref>https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat507/node/54</ref> With retrospective studies, the temporal relationship is frequently difficult to assess.<ref name="ocw.tufts.edu">http://ocw.tufts.edu/Content/1/lecturenotes/194039/194062</ref> Further, those conducting retrospective studies can't control exposure or outcome assessment, but instead need to rely on others for accurate record-keeping.<ref name="ocw.tufts.edu"/> This is particularly problematic because it can be very difficult to make accurate comparisons between the exposed and non-exposed.<ref name="ocw.tufts.edu"/> Retrospective studies also can need very large sample sizes for rare outcomes.<ref name="ocw.tufts.edu"/>
