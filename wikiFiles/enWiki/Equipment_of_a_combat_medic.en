This article discusses the standard '''equipment of a [[Combat Medic]]'''.

==Role==
An armed medic, or a medic engaging in any combat role (such as manning an artillery piece), is considered a combatant and is not subject to protection under the [[Geneva Conventions]]. In order to enjoy those protections, a medic must be unarmed and also wear large, clear identifying insignia such as a red cross. However, in the type of [[asymmetric warfare]] which typifies modern conflicts, the enemy often has no respect for the laws of war and may in fact actively target medics (in addition to officers and radio operators), for the significant value they have in keeping the unit combat-effective. Thus, in most modern forces, medics are armed and do not wear large identifying insignia. A rifle or carbine is standard, often augmented with a sidearm because the medic may have to pass his rifle off in order to treat the wounded.

There is actually no requirement to wear identifying insignia or to be unarmed.  Geneva Conventions require that Medics use weapons to defend only themselves or their patients.  To understand this, one must know that litter-bearers fall under the same protection, but are not required to be marked or unarmed.  [[Chaplain]]s can also carry weapons to defend themselves.

==Weapons==
The [[Combat Medic]] is commonly referred to as "Doc."{{fact|date=August 2012}} With a combat unit, they function as a member of an infantry platoon up until the point that one of their comrades is wounded. Therefore, the Medic carries basically what a [[Rifleman]] or any other soldier carries. His Basic Equipment is usually:

* An M4 rifle and in some units an M9 pistol.
* A [[MOLLE]] Vest with a full "combat load," being (most often) 210 rounds for the M-4/M-16 rifle.
* An [[Interceptor body armor|IBA]] or Interceptor Body Armor, now being phased out in favor for the newer [[Improved Outer Tactical Vest|IOTV]];
* The [[Army Combat Uniform]];
* An ACH, or [[Advanced Combat Helmet]].

==Medical Equipment==
A combat medic will typically carry a backpack styled bag known as a "Unit One Pack". Aid bags are available from many different manufacturers, in many different styles. Depending on the unit and their standard operating procedures, the medic may have to follow a strict packing list, or may have the liberty of choosing their kit depending on the mission at hand. A typical aid bag will include:

'''Fluid Resuscitation''' 

* IV fluids and tubing. The amount will depend on the length of mission. Normal Saline/Sodium Chloride, Hetastarch/Hextend, and Lactated Ringers(LR) are usually carried.
* 18, 16, and 14 gauge IV catheters.
* FAST 1 intra-osseous fluid administration kit.  The FAST 1 is a quick way to administer fluids when peripheral and external jugular venous access is unavailable due to massive blood loss, burns, or loss of limbs.

'''Hemorrhage (blood loss) Control'''

* CAT, SOFT-T or improvised tourniquets. [[Tourniquets]] are used for the care under fire phase of tactical combat casualty care, to stop massive life threatening hemorrhage. 
* Emergency Trauma Bandages, a newer version of the first aid pressure dressing. 
* Kerlix gauze, for stopping hemorrhage, or creating a bulky dressing. 
* Hemostatic agents, such as Celox, Hemcon bandages, and others.  Some hemostatic agents are controversial due to their thermodynamic nature, which causes collateral damage if the user is not properly trained. 

'''Airway Management'''

* 14 gauge [[catheter]], at least 3.25&nbsp;inches long, for needle chest decompression. 
* Asherman chest seal, Bolin chest seal or Hyphin chest seal, as an occlusive dressing for sucking chest wounds.
* Nasopharyngeal Airway (NPA)w/surgilube or "nasal trumpet." This flexible tube secures a nasal airway when the casualty does not have, or may lose their ability to keep their own airway open. Contraindicated by signs of skull fracture.
* Oropharyngeal Airway, a hard "J" shaped plastic device that secures an oral airway, and can also be used to keep the teeth open for a more permanent airway device.
* King LTD, a simple tube airway with an inflatable cuff to create a sealed airway.
* Combitube, like a King LTD, but designed to be able to function almost no matter how the tube is placed due to the dual lumen tube design.
* Surgical [[Cricothyrotomy]] kit. Many different styles and kits exist, the choice is up to the individual medic's supply or preference. The most simple is a scalpel to open an airway, and to use an NPA to keep the airway patent.

'''Assorted Equipment'''

* Nitrile gloves
* Alcohol or Providine/Iodine swabs
* Cravats (muslin bandages)
* Assorted gauze bandages
* Band-Aids
* Assorted sizes of tape
* Coban, a stretchy, self clinging wrap
* Ace Bandages
* Assorted hypodermic needles and syringes
* Combat Casualty Card
* SAM Splint -- a flexible, reusable splint with a metal core covered in closed cell foam.
* Water Jel burn dressing
* Small sharps shuttle
* Trauma Shears
* Safety pins

'''Battlefield Medicine'''

* [[Morphine]]
* Antibiotics
* [[Narcan]], a narcotics antagonist, to counter morphine's respiratory-depressing effects.
* [[Phenergan]], an anti-nausea treatment, which also increases the pain-reducing effects of morphine.
* [[Epi-pen]], [[epinephrine]] in an auto injecting "pen" to counter [[anaphylactic]] (severe allergic) reactions.

A combat medic is generally expected to care for the needs of the soldiers in his group, including their everyday ailments. A medic will usually carry a small amount of what are referred to as "snivel" or "sick call meds."  These are common [[over-the-counter medication]]s that do not require a prescription.

* [[Paracetamol]] (Tylenol), anti-pyretic and pain reducer.
* [[Naproxen]] and [[ibuprofen]], different [[NSAID]]s which reduce pain and inflammation.
* [[Diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl), an antihistamine with a sedative side effect.
* [[Pseudoephedrine]], a nasal decongestant.
* [[Guaifenesin]], an expectorant.
* Loperamide (Imodium AD) an anti-diarheal agent.
* Pepto Bismol tablets, to settle upset stomachs, treat diarrhea, and heartburn.
* Colace (docusate sodium), a medium strength stool softener.

A Combat Medic may also carry other supplies as the mission dictates. A [[stethoscope]], [[blood pressure cuff]], [[pulse oximeter]], [[otoscope]], [[ophthalmoscope]], and [[thermometer]] may help the medic treat his/her soldiers or civilians on the battlefield (COBs) while on an extended mission, as space dictates.
