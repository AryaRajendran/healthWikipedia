Has possibly the earliest onset compared to  all other schizophrenias, considered to begin in some within childhood. Symptomatic of the ''simplex'' is an absence of will, impoverished thinking and flattening of affect. There is a gradual deterioration of functioning with increased amotivation and reduced  [[socialization]].<ref>[[Brown University]] - [http://www.brown.edu/Courses/BI_278/Other/Clerkship/Didactics/Readings/Schizophrenia.pdf Schizophrenia DSM-IV TR#295.1-295.30, 295.90)] Retrieved 2012-01-22</ref><ref>Baiceng Lou, Thomas Dey - Soothing the troubled mind: acupuncture and moxibustion in the treatment of schizophrenia [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xxqMQ7QVsLYC&pg=PA21&dq=%22Simple-type+schizophrenia%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ytAbT9rKMcSZ8gOdkJmfCw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22Simple-type%20schizophrenia%22&f=false Paradigm Publications, 1999] Retrieved 2012-01-22</ref> It is considered to be rarely diagnosed and is a schizophrenia without psychotic symptoms (Mueser & Jeste  2008).<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KFMFzuL3husC&dq=schizophrenia+Simple-type&source=gbs_navlinks_s  Kim Tornvall Mueser & Dilip V.

==Causes==

A progressive state of simple dementia results often in cases of adolescent onset Juvenile general paresis. Paresis is being caused by placental-foetal transfer of infection and results in intellectual (mental) subnormality. Occurrence of this type of paresis is altogether uncommon (Lishman  1998).<ref name="Poem 1"/>

ICD-10 specifies the continuation of symptoms for a period of two years in the diagnosis of simple schizophrenia. This is because of disagreement on the classification validity of the sub-type, that having been retained by the ICD classification, has been omitted from DSM classifications.<ref>Armenian Medical Network - [http://www.health.am/psy/more/subtypes-of-schizophrenia/  subtypes-of-schizophrenia] Retrieved 2012-01-31 [content is found under heading ''Course and sub-types of schizophrenia'']</ref>
