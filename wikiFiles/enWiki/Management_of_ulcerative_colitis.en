'''Management of [[ulcerative colitis]]''' involves first treating the [[acute (medical)|acute]] symptoms of the disease, then maintaining [[Remission (medicine)|remission]]. Ulcerative colitis is a form of [[colitis]], a [[disease]] of the [[intestine]], specifically the large intestine or [[colon (anatomy)|colon]], that includes characteristic [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]], or open sores, in the colon. The main symptom of active disease is usually [[diarrhea]] mixed with blood, of gradual onset which often leads to [[anaemia]]. Ulcerative colitis is, however, a [[systemic disease]] that affects many parts of the body outside the intestine.

==Medications==
Standard treatment for ulcerative colitis depends on ''extent of involvement'' and disease ''severity''. The goal is to induce [[remission (medicine)|remission]] initially with medications, followed by the administration of maintenance medications to prevent a relapse of the disease. The concept of induction of remission and maintenance of remission is very important. The medications used to induce and maintain a remission somewhat overlap, but the treatments are different. Physicians first direct treatment to inducing a remission which involves relief of symptoms and mucosal healing of the lining of the colon and then longer term treatment to maintain the remission.

[[Anaemia]], caused by both chronic blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract and reduced absorption due to the up-regulation of [[hepcidin]] should also be treated, and this often requires the use of [[parenteral iron]].<ref>http://chinesefms.com/doc/zhw/doc_zhw_xzzn/201104/P020110416418498436822.pdf</ref>

The following sections are sorted first by drug type and, second, by the type of ulcerative colitis.

===Aminosalicylates===
'''Aminosalicylates''' are the main [[anti-inflammatory]] drugs used to treat ulcerative colitis. Sometimes remission can be achieved, or at least maintained, with these drugs alone. If not, they are usually used in combination with the drugs listed in the ensuing sections.

The anti-inflammatory action in all these drugs is produced by 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), the active ingredient in Mesalazine. 5-ASA is produced from the other drugs in the intestine. The aminosalicylates used to treat ulcerative colitis include the following:
*[[Mesalazine]], also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid, mesalamine, or 5-ASA. Brand names include: Asacol, Octasa, Pentasa, Salofalk, Lialda, Ipocol and Mezavant.
*[[Sulfasalazine]], also known as Azulfidine. This drug belongs a traditional class of antibiotics, but decomposes in the intestine, releasing 5-ASA.
*[[Balsalazide]], also known as Colazal, intended to release 5-ASA only in the large intestine.
*[[Olsalazine]], also known as Dipentum, intended to release 5-ASA only in the large intestine.

5-ASA is poorly-absorbed by the intestines, and hence provides topical relief within the intestine. It is therefore a non-systemic drug. 5-ASA is related to the systemic [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs), such as [[Aspirin]] and [[Ibuprofen]].

The free radical induction theory, discussed below, proposes that 5-ASA is serving not just as an anti-inflammatory agent, but also as a free radical trap, destroying the hydroxyl and other radicals that may damage colonic epithelial barrier.<ref name=Pravda>{{cite journal |author=Pravda J |title=Radical induction theory of ulcerative colitis |journal=World J. Gastroenterol. |volume=11 |issue=16 |pages=2371–84 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15832404 |url=http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/11/2371.asp}}</ref>  5-ASA may also be an inhibitor of [[TNF]].

====Sulfasalazine side-effects====

Possible side effects of 5-ASA include, nausea and vomiting, reduced sperm count and damage to red or white blood cells, or to the liver, kidneys, pancreas, nerves or hearing. Allergic reactions to sulfasalazine characterized by dizziness, fever and skin rash have been reported in a small percentage of patients. In some cases, sulfasalazine can exacerbate ulcerative colitis resulting in diarahea, abdominal cramps and discomfort.

In the intestine sulfasalazine is converted to 5-ASA and sulfapyridine, which is responsible for some of its side-effects, and which should be monitored in patients taking sulfasalazine. Sulfapyridine levels above 50 mcg/L are associated with the side-effects.

Patients on high dose sulfasalazine require [[Folic acid|folic supplementation]] (1&nbsp;mg/day) (1000 mcg/day) to maintain normal cell division. This may, however, be counter-productive for patients who are also taking methotrexate, which is a folic acid inhibitor. Folic acid might also be counter-productive for patients taking 6-MP and related drugs that inhibit all cell division.

===Corticosteroids===
It is often necessary to use [[Corticosteroid]]s in conjunction with 5-ASA drugs to bring about remission of ulcerative colitis. Thereafter it may be possible to maintain remission with 5-ASAs alone, or it may be necessary to continue administering corticosteroids to maintain.

Corticosteroids reduce inflammation by blocking portions of the [[leukocyte adhesion cascade]] which results in inflammation.

Side effects of corticosteroids include [[Cushing's syndrome]], which most often exhibits itself as temporary facial puffyness, called "moon face". Cushing's syndrome can, however, involve [[psychosis]], including [[mania|manic]] behavior. These drugs have been known to trigger [[bipolar disorder]]. In prescribing these drugs it might be well to inquire as to any family history of bipolar disorder.

Corticosteroids should not be confused with [[anabolic steroid]]s, the controversial performance-building "steroids" that are banned in certain sports.   

The following corticosteroids are used as immune system suppressants in treatment of ulcerative colitis:
*[[Cortisone]]
*[[Prednisone]]
*[[Hydrocortisone]]
*[[Methylprednisolone]]
*[[Budesonide]], also known as Entocort, available for oral use or as an enema. Budesonide is metabolized faster than traditional steroids and appears to produce fewer side effects.

===Immunosuppressive drugs===
[[Immunosuppressive drug]]s inhibit the immune system generally. These include the [[cytotoxic|cytostatic drugs]] that inhibit cell division, including the [[cloning]] of [[white blood cell]]s that is a part of the immune response. Immunosuppressive drugs used with ulcerative colitis include:

*[[Mercaptopurine]], also known as 6-Mercaptopurine, 6-MP and Purinethiol.
*[[Azathioprine]], also known as Imuran (US) or Azasan, which metabolises to 6-MP.
*[[Methotrexate]], which inhibits folic acid

Mercaptopurine is a cytostatic drug that is an [[antimetabolite]]. The mercaptopurine molecule mimics [[purine]], which is necessary for the synthesis of [[DNA]]. With mercaptopurine present, cells are not able to make DNA, and cell division is inhibited. 

In administering mercaptopurine it is necessary to monitor the levels of mercaptopurine metabolites in the blood to establish the correct dosage for a patient. An initial concern is [[hepatotoxicity]].

Mercaptopurine inhibits the production of [[white blood cells]] generally. Because this makes the body more susceptible to infection, patients need to watched for infections. [[Vaccination]]s should also be done with caution.

Frequent [[complete blood count|blood cell count]]s are also recommended during administration of mercaptopurine. The drug may be toxic to [[bone marrow]], where many blood components are made. If there is an abnormally large drop in white blood cell count, or any blood cell count, administration of the drug should be halted at least temporarily.

Methotrexate is another immunosuppressive drug. It works by inhibiting [[folic acid]], which is necessary for DNA replication and, therefore, cell division.

===TNF inhibitors===
{{Main|Biological therapy for inflammatory bowel disease}}
[[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|TNF]] is a protein that is released by activated white blood cells, triggering more inflammation, an immune system response and more damage to the mucosa of the colon because of the immune activation. Certain drugs inhibit TNF, hence reducing inflammation and immune system involvement. Infliximab was approved by the FDA for treating ulcerative colitis in March 2005. It is usually given as an intravenous infusions at weeks 0,2 and 6 and then every eight weeks thereafter. It is very useful for inducing and maintaining a remission of ulcerative colitis. Some physicians think that infliximab works better when used in combination with immunmodulators such as 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine, but there is no definitive evidence based medicine to conclude that infliximab must be used with 6-mp or azathioprine. 

*[[Infliximab]]

===Treatment for proctitis===
''[[Proctitis]]'' usually involves the distal, or lower, {{convert|10|-|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} of the colon, including the [[rectum]]. Approximately 30% of ulcerative colitis patients initially present with proctitis. 

Standard treatment for active disease includes Mesalazine suppositories and cortisone foam (Cortifoam). Mesalazine 1 g SUPP QHS or Cortifoam QHS/BID is continued until remission, with response seen usually within three weeks. 

Maintenance therapy is with Mesalazine 1g QHS or Q3HS. Those with anal irritation or discomfort from the suppositories may switch to oral medications, such as sulfasalazine, Mesalazine, or Colazol, although they are not as effective as suppositories for proctitis. Maintenance therapy is not recommended for those with a first episode that responded to the Mesalazine. Steroid foam is not shown to prevent relapse. 

Systemic steroids such as prednisone are not used unless proctitis fails to respond to the above treatments.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kornbluth A, Sachar DB |title=Ulcerative colitis practice guidelines in adults (update): American College of Gastroenterology, Practice Parameters Committee |journal=Am. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=99 |issue=7 |pages=1371–85 |year=2004 |month=July |pmid=15233681 |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2004.40036.x}}</ref>

===Treatment for proctosigmoiditis and left-sided colitis===
''Proctosigmoiditis and left-sided colitis'' involves the lower colon, from the rectum up the left side of the patient. 

Patients often respond to topical agents alone, such as Mesalazine, or hydrocortisone enemas. Again, the Mesalazine is preferred for maintenance therapy. 

*Initially a 4 g Mesalazine enema (Rowasa) is given nightly.
*If response is seen, the enemas can be tapered to every third night.
*If no response, a morning Mesalazine, or hydrocortisone enema (Cortenema) can be given.
*If still no response, oral anti-inflammatory drugs, with or without enemas, can be given, such as sulfasalazine, Mesalazine (Asacol, Pentasa), olsalazine (Dipentum), or balsalazide (Colazal).
*If still no response, dose should be increased to maximum: sulfasalazine maxes at 4-6 g/day, Mesalazine maxes at 4.8 g/day, and olsalazine at 3 g/day. They are usually divided tid or bid.

Oral anti-inflammatory drugs require four to six weeks to work. 

Once remission is induced, maintenance levels can be used: sulfasalazine 2 g/day, mesalamine 1.2-2.4 g/day, or olsalazine 1 g/day. Patients on high dose sulfasalazine require [[Folic acid|folic supplementation]] (1&nbsp;mg/day) because it inhibits folate absorption. 

If oral Mesalazine is still not working, prednisone is often given, starting at 40–60&nbsp;mg/day. Prednisone often takes effect within 10–14 days. The dose should then be tapered by about 5&nbsp;mg/week until it can be stopped altogether.

===Treatment for extensive or pancolitis===
''Extensive or pancolitis''. Patients usually require a combination of oral Mesalazine or sulfasalazine along with topical Mesalazine or steroid enemas. Oral prednisone (40–60&nbsp;mg/day) should be given only in severe cases or if oral Mesalazine fails. Once remission is induced, maintenance therapy is with standard oral Mesalazine doses. Supplemental iron ([[ferrous sulfate]] or [[ferrous gluconate]]) may be given due to chronic blood loss. [[Loperamide]] may be given for symptomatic relief of chronic diarrhea, but should not be given in suspected toxic megacolon.

===Treatment for severe or fulminant colitis===
''Severe or fulminant colitis''. Patients need to be hospitalized immediately with subsequent bowel rest, nutrition, and IV steroids. Typical starting choices are hydrocortisone 100&nbsp;mg IV q8h, prednisolone 30&nbsp;mg IV q12h, or methylprednisolone 16–20&nbsp;mg IV q8h. The last two are preferred due to less sodium retention and potassium wasting. 24-hour continuous infusion is preferred than the stated dosing. If the patient has not had any corticosteroids within the last 30 days, IV ACTH 120 units/day as continuous infusion is superior than the IV steroids mentioned above. In either case, if symptoms persist after 2–3 days, Mesalazine or hydrocortisone enemas daily or bid can be given. The use of antibiotics in those with severe colitis is not clear. However, there are those patients who have sub-optimal response to corticosteroids and continue to run a low grade fever with bandemia. Typically they can be treated with IV ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. However, in those with fulminant colitis or megacolon, with high fever, leukocytosis with high bandemia, and peritoneal signs, broad spectrum antibiotics should be given (i.e., [[ceftazidime]], [[cefepime]], [[imipeneum]], [[meropenem]], etc.). Abdominal x-ray should also be ordered. If intestinal dilation is seen, patients should be decompressed with NG tube and or rectal tube.

===Treatment for refractory ulcerative colitis===
''Refractory ulcerative colitis''. Patients with toxic megacolon (colonic dilation > 6&nbsp;cm and toxic appearing) who do not respond to steroid therapy within 72 hours should be consulted for colectomy. Those with less severe disease but do not respond to IV steroids within 7–10 days should be considered for colectomy or IV cyclosporine. IV cyclosporine at a rate of 2&nbsp;mg/kg/day and if no response in 7–10 days, colectomy should be considered. If response is seen, oral cyclosporine at 8&nbsp;mg/kg/day should be continued for 3–4 months while 6-MP or azathioprine is introduced. Those already on 6-MP or azathioprine should continue with these medications. A cholesterol level should be checked in patients taking cyclosporine as low cholesterol may predispose to seizures. Also, prophylaxis against PCP ([[Pneumocystis carinii]]) pneumonia is advised.

==Surgery==
Unlike Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis can generally be cured by surgical removal of the large intestine. This procedure is necessary in the event of [[exsanguination|exsanguinating]] [[internal bleeding|hemorrhage]], frank perforation, or documented or strongly suspected [[carcinoma]]. Surgery is also indicated for patients with severe colitis or toxic megacolon. Patients with symptoms that are disabling and do not respond to drugs may wish to consider whether surgery would improve the quality of life.

Ulcerative colitis is a disease that affects many parts of the body outside the intestinal tract. In rare cases the extra-intestinal manifestations of the disease may require removal of the colon.<ref name=ACGGuideline>Ulcerative Colitis Practice Guidelines in Adults, Am. Coll. Gastroenterology, 2004. [http://www.acg.gi.org/physicians/guidelines/UlcerativeColitisUpdate.pdf PDF]</ref>

==Alternative treatments==
===Dietary modification===
*[[Lactose intolerance]] is noted in many ulcerative colitis patients. Those with suspicious symptoms should get a lactose breath hydrogen test. If lactose is restricted, calcium may need to be supplemented to avoid bone loss {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}.
*Patients with abdominal cramping or diarrhea should avoid fresh fruit, caffeine, carbonated drinks, high fructose corn syrup and [[sorbitol]]-containing foods {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}.
* The [[Specific Carbohydrate Diet]] has been promoted as helping with the [[symptom]]s of various auto-immune and gastrointestinal problems, including ulcerative colitis {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}.

===Fats and oils===
* '''Fish oil'''. [[Eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), derived from fish oil. This is an [[Eicosanoid]] that inhibits [[leukotriene]] activity. It is effective as an adjunct therapy. Usual dose is 15-18 capsules a day.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/patient-fishoil.html |title = MedlinePlus Herbs and Supplements: Omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil, alpha-linolenic acid |accessdate = 2008-06-30}}</ref>
*Slow release [[phosphatidylcholine]] has some evidence of benefit in ulcerative colitis.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Stremmel W, Merle U, Zahn A, Autschbach F, Hinz U, Ehehalt R | title =Retarded release phosphatidylcholine benefits patients with chronic active ulcerative colitis | journal = Gut | volume = 54 | issue = 7 | pages = 966–971 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15951544 | pmc = 1774598 | doi = 10.1136/gut.2004.052316 }}</ref>

===Antioxidants===
The free radical induction theory suggests that the initial cause of ulcerative colitis may be a metabolic defect that allows a build up of chemicals related to hydrogen peroxide beneath the membrane that protects the cells of the intestinal wall from the bacteria inside the intestine, resulting in destruction of the membrane. During remission the membrane is reestablished, but may be subject to new damage, resulting in a flare up of the disease.<ref name=Pravda/> To the extent this may be true, it would be appropriate to take [[antioxidant]]s, dietary supplements that may support the body's defenses against oxidants like hydrogen peroxide. Antioxidants include:

* Vitamins [[vitamin A|A]], [[vitamin C|C]] and [[vitamin E|E]]
* [[Coenzyme Q10]]
* [[Selenium]] and [[manganese]].

[[Vitamin B6]] and [[iron]] may be associated with increased hydrogen peroxide levels, and should not be taken in excess under this theory.<ref name=Pravda/>

*[[Boswellia]] is an ayurvedic (Indian traditional medicine) herb, used as a natural alternative to manufactured drugs. One study has found its effectiveness similar to sulfasalazine.<ref>{{pmid|9049593}}</ref>

*[[Medicinal cannabis]] has been reported to significantly reduce abdominal discomfort and irritability that is often caused by ulcerative colitis.

===Helminthic therapy===
Inflammatory bowel disease is less common in the developing world {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. Some{{Who|date=October 2011}} have suggested that this may be because intestinal parasites are more common in underdeveloped countries. Some parasites are able to reduce the immune response of the intestine, an adaptation that helps the parasite colonize the intestine{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. The decrease in immune response could reduce or eliminate the inflammatory bowel disease.

[[Helminthic therapy]] using the [[whipworm]] ''Trichuris suis'' has been shown in a [[randomized control trial]] from Iowa to show benefit in patients with ulcerative colitis. The therapy tests the hygiene [[hypothesis]] which argues that the absence of [[helminths]] in the [[colon (anatomy)|colons]] of patients in the western world may lead to [[inflammation]]. Both [[helminthic therapy]] and [[fecal bacteriotherapy]] induce a characteristic [[Th2]] white cell response in the diseased areas, which is somewhat paradoxical given that ulcerative colitis immunology was thought to classically involve Th2 overproduction<ref>{{cite journal |author=Summers RW, Elliott DE, Urban JF, Thompson RA, Weinstock JV |title=Trichuris suis therapy for active ulcerative colitis: a randomized controlled trial |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=128 |issue=4 |pages=825–32 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15825065 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016508505000259 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2005.01.005}}</ref>
