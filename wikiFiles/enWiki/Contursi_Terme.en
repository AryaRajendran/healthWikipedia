'''Contursi Terme''' is a village and ''[[comune]]'' in the [[province of Salerno]] in the [[Campania]] region of south-western [[Italy]].

==Early history==
No secure identification of Contursi Terme, where ancient remains confirm a settlement at the confluence of the [[Tanagro]] (ancient Tanager) with the [[Sele]], is likely. The Roman ''Ursentum'' noted in [[Pliny's Natural History]] (III.2), is more usually identified with [[Caggiano]].<ref>[http://www.albedimare.org/castrum/MH_topos.html#U Megale Hellas: Glossario dei Toponomastica Antica]</ref> The local historian A. Filomarino,<ref>Filomarino, ''Contursi figlia di Saginara''  Rome, 1923.</ref> based on etymologies of [[toponym]]s, placed the commune's origins as early as the fourth century AD, the result of efforts by the inhabitants of the former Saginara and Contursi to fortify a site that was destroyed by Alaric's Goths at the end of the fourth century. Under the [[Lombards]] it appears to have belonged to the [[Gastaldo|gastaldate]] of [[Conza]],<ref>[http://www.contursiterme.com/franco_pignata.html Franco Pignata "Il Sentiero dei passi perduti"]</ref> when a fortress was built in 840 by Orso, count of Conza, from whom the stronghold probably took its name ''Castrum comitis Ursi'', the "castle of count Orso")<ref>Vito Lembo, ''op.cit.''</ref> Orso took the part of his kinsman [[Siconulf of Salerno]] (839-51) in internecine wars with [[Radelchis I of Benevento]], who had been a former gastaldo of Conza.

The later history of Contursi Termi<ref>The history is taken from [http://www.contursiterme.com/storia_delle_terme.html Storia delle Termi] and from  Vito Lembo, historical notes in ''Per la Campania'', December 1905 ([http://www.contursiterme.com/vito_lembo.html on-line text])..</ref> formed a local part of the [[Principality of Salerno]], which was retained as a title until the territory was divided in three by [[Charles II of Naples]] in 1287, Contursi passing to the prince of Citerione (or Citra) and held by the family Sanseverino. In 1348, Contursi was taken by [[Louis of Taranto]], king of Naples by right of his wife Joanna; he   passed the title to his adherents, the Origlia.  In 1448 Antonio Sanseverino succeeded in reclaiming title to Contursi, but the Sanseverino heirs held it only until the early sixteenth century, under the [[List of viceroys of Naples|Viceroys of Naples]]. From the seventeenth century the commune passed successively through a number of families, the Bernalli, Pepe, Ludovisi and Parisani Bonanno. The last to hold the contado before the reunification of Italy were the Pisani di Tolentino, marchesi di Caggiano.

==The thermal springs==
The thermal baths, insecurely linked to notices by Roman writers, were described in a manuscript ''Balnea Contursi'' of 1231;<ref>The manuscript is conserved in the Archivio della Badia della SS. Trinità di Cava dei Tirreni ([http://www.contursiterme.com/storia_delle_terme.html Storia delle termi]).</ref> The fifteen thermal springs, with varying mineral content, have retained their curative reputation, for bathing, both in warm pools and in a cold plunge, and for drinking.

==Parkinson's disease==
Families from the village have played an important role in the understanding of [[Parkinson's disease]]. In 1986, Larry Golbe, a doctor based at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, came across a family with six Parkinson's patients, and found that they had originated in Contursi.<ref name="UMDNJ">{{Citation  | last =Jacobs | first =Eve | author-link = | publication-date =Fall 2004 | date = | year =2004 | title =Gene Hunter | periodical =UMDNJ Magazine | publisher =University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey | volume =I | issue =II | pages = | url =http://www.umdnj.edu/umcweb/marketing_and_communications/publications/umdnj_magazine/fall2004/2.htm  | issn = | doi = | oclc = | accessdate =2008-05-30}}</ref> A few months later he found a second family with several Parkinson's patients, who also had ancestors from the village.<ref name="UMDNJ" /> This prompted Golbe to collaborate with Giuseppe DiIorio at the University of Naples, to analyse the DNA from Contursani and people who had emigrated from the village across the world.<ref name="UMDNJ" /> They identified three families in Italy and three families in the US, all of whom were descendants from a single couple who lived in Contursi in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.<ref name="UMDNJ" />  Of 400 members of this extended family, known as the "Contursi kindred", 61 are known to have had Parkinson's.<ref name="UMDNJ" /> This showed for the first time that Parkinson's could be inherited.<ref>{{Citation  | last =Golbe | first =LI et al.| author-link = | publication-date = | year =1990 | title =A large kindred with autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease | periodical =Ann Neurol. | volume =27 | issue =3 | pages =276–82 | issn = | doi = 10.1002/ana.410270309| oclc =| pmid =2158268  | last2 =Di Iorio  | first2 =G  | last3 =Bonavita  | first3 =V  | last4 =Miller  | first4 =DC  | last5 =Duvoisin  | first5 =RC}}</ref>

Geneticists Alice Lazzarini and William Johnson worked through the early 1990s trying to isolate the mutation that caused the disease.<ref name="UMDNJ" /> They tracked it down to chromosome 4q21-q23 in 1996,<ref>{{Citation  | last =Polymeropoulos | first = M.H. et al. | author-link = | publication-date = | date = | year =1996 | title = Mapping of a gene for Parkinson's disease to chromosome 4q21-q23 | periodical =Science | volume = 274 | issue = 5290| pages =1197–1100 | url =http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/274/5290/1197 | issn = | doi = 10.1126/science.274.5290.1197| oclc = | accessdate =  | last2 =Higgins  | first2 =J.

}}</ref> and the following year identified the mutation in the [[alpha-synuclein]] gene.<ref>{{Citation |author=Polymeropoulos M, Lavedan C, Leroy E et al. |title=Mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene identified in families with Parkinson's disease |journal=Science |volume=276 |issue=5321 |pages=2045–7 |year=1997 |pmid=9197268 |doi=10.1126/science.276.5321.2045}}</ref> Within days, other researchers found α-synuclein in the [[Lewy bodies]], the blobs of protein found in the brains of Parkinson's patients.<ref name="UMDNJ" /> This suggested that the protein is involved in the normal course of Parkinson's, even when the patient has not inherited a mutated α-synuclein gene. It has also allowed fresh approaches to the study of Parkinson's, such as animal models with mutated α-synuclein genes.<ref name="UMDNJ" />

Golbe continues to work with the Contursi kindred to uncover more details of the mechanism of Parkinson's. He has already discovered that variations in the gene for [[glutathione-S-transferase]] can affect the age at which the disease starts.<ref name="UMDNJ" /> GST appears to detoxify one or more agents that play a part in neuron loss.<ref name="UMDNJ" />
