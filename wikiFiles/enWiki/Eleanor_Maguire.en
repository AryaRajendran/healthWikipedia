'''Eleanor A. Maguire''' FMedSci is an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[neuroscientist]] who works in London, UK.<ref name="MaguireQA">{{cite journal|last1=Maguire|first1=Eleanor A.|title=Eleanor A. Maguire|journal=Current Biology|volume=22|issue=24|year=2012|pages=R1025–R1027|issn=09609822|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2012.10.007}}</ref> She undertook her PhD at [[University College Dublin]], Ireland, where she first became interested in the neural basis of memory while working with patients as a neuropsychologist. She is a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow and Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at the [[Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging]] at [[University College London]],<ref name="MaguireFIL">{{cite web|title=Memory & Space: Professor Eleanor Maguire FMedSci|url=http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/Maguire/|publisher=Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at UCL|accessdate=1 November 2012}}</ref> UK, where she is also the Deputy Head. Maguire heads the Memory and Space research laboratory at the Centre. In addition, she is an honorary member of the Department of Neuropsychology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, London.

== Research ==
Maguire and others have noted that a distributed set of brain regions supports human [[Episodic memory|episodic (autobiographical) memory]], defined as the memory for personal everyday
events,<ref name="Maguire2001">{{cite journal|last1=Maguire|first1=E. A.|title=Neuroimaging studies of autobiographical event memory|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=356|issue=1413|year=2001|pages=1441–1451|issn=0962-8436|doi=10.1098/rstb.2001.0944}}</ref>
and that this brain network overlaps considerably with that supporting navigation in large-scale space and other diverse cognitive functions such as
imagination and thinking about the future.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hassabis|first=Demis|coauthors=Maguire, Eleanor A.|title=Deconstructing episodic memory with construction|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|year=2007|volume=11|issue=7|pages=299–306|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2007.05.001|pmid=17548229}}</ref>
In her research Maguire seeks to place episodic memory in the context of wider cognition so as to understand how common
brain areas, and possibly common processes, support such disparate functions. In this way she hopes to gain novel and fundamental insights into the mechanisms that
are involved.<ref name="MaguireFIL" />

Her team uses standard whole brain and high resolution structural and functional [[magnetic resonance imaging]] in
conjunction with behavioural testing and neuropsychological examination of amnesic patients in order to pursue
their aims. They mainly employ ecologically valid or 'real life' experimental paradigms to examine brain-behaviour
relationships; examples include using virtual reality to examine navigation<ref name="Maguire1998">{{cite journal|last1=Maguire|first1=Eleanor A.|title=Knowing Where and Getting There: A Human Navigation Network|journal=Science|volume=280|issue=5365|year=1998|pages=921–924|issn=00368075|doi=10.1126/science.280.5365.921|pmid=9572740}}</ref><ref name="SpiersMaguire2006">{{cite journal|last1=Spiers|first1=Hugo J.|last2=Maguire|first2=Eleanor A.|title=Thoughts, behaviour, and brain dynamics during navigation in the real world|journal=NeuroImage|volume=31|issue=4|year=2006|pages=1826–1840|issn=10538119|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.01.037}}</ref>
, investigating autobiographical memories of people’s personal past experiences, and their ability to imagine fictitious and future scenes and events.
Perhaps the most famous of these is her series of studies on London taxi drivers<ref name="WoollettMaguire2011">{{cite journal|last1=Woollett|first1=Katherine|last2=Maguire|first2=Eleanor A.|title=Acquiring "the Knowledge" of London's Layout Drives Structural Brain Changes|journal=Current Biology|volume=21|issue=24|year=2011|pages=2109–2114|issn=09609822|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.11.018}}</ref><ref name="MaguireGadian2000">{{cite journal|last1=Maguire|first1=E.

, where she documented changes in hippocampal structure associated with acquiring the knowledge of London’s layout. This work on hippocampal
plasticity not only interested scientists, but also engaged the public and media world-wide.

This is also true of her other work such as that showing that patients with amnesia cannot imagine the future <ref name="HassabisKumaran2007">{{cite journal|last1=Hassabis|first1=D.|last2=Kumaran|first2=D.|last3=Vann|first3=S.

and her other studies demonstrating that it is possible to decode people’s memories from the
pattern of fMRI activity in the hippocampus.<ref name="ChadwickHassabis2010">{{cite journal|last1=Chadwick|first1=Martin J.|last2=Hassabis|first2=Demis|last3=Weiskopf|first3=Nikolaus|last4=Maguire|first4=Eleanor A.|title=Decoding Individual Episodic Memory Traces in the Human Hippocampus|journal=Current Biology|volume=20|issue=6|year=2010|pages=544–547|issn=09609822|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.01.053}}</ref><ref name='Bonnici2012'>{{cite journal | title = Detecting representations of recent and remote autobiographical memories in vmPFC and hippocampus | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | date = in press | first = HM | last = Bonnici | coauthors = Chadwick MJ, Lutti A, Hassabis D, Weiskopf N, Maguire EA | accessdate = 2012-11-02}}</ref>

Maguire’s interest is mainly focused on the [[hippocampus]], a brain structure known to be crucial for
learning and memory, whilst also exploring the roles of the [[parahippocampal cortex]], the [[retrosplenial cortex]] and the
[[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]].<ref name='Bonnici2012' />

engagement agenda, involving public lectures, school visits and demonstrations, TV, radio and
internet contributions, and collaborations with several artists, encouraging people of all ages to
think about the value of science in their everyday lives.
