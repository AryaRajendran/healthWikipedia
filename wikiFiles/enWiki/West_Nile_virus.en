'''West Nile virus''' (WNV) is a [[Mosquito-borne disease|mosquito-borne]] [[zoonotic]] [[arbovirus]] belonging to the [[genus]] Flavivirus in the [[Family (biology)|family]] ''[[Flaviviridae]]''. This [[flavivirus]] is found in [[temperate]] and [[tropics|tropical]] regions of the world. It was first identified in the [[West Nile sub-region|West Nile subregion]] in the [[East Africa]]n nation of [[Uganda]] in 1937.
Prior to the mid-1990s, WNV disease occurred only sporadically and was considered a minor risk for humans, until an outbreak in [[Algeria]] in 1994, with cases of WNV-caused encephalitis, and the first large outbreak in [[Romania]] in 1996, with a high number of cases with  [[Neurotropic virus|neuroinvasive disease]]. WNV has now spread globally, with the first case in the [[Western Hemisphere]] being identified in [[New York City]] in 1999;<ref name=Nash01>{{cite journal |author=Nash D, Mostashari F, Fine A, ''et al.'' |title=The outbreak of West Nile virus infection in the New York City area in 1999 |journal=N.

WNV also spread to [[Europe]], beyond the [[Mediterranean Basin]] [a new strain of the virus was recently (2012) identified in [[Italy]]]. WNV is now considered to be an [[endemic]] [[pathogen]] in Africa, Asia, [[Australia]], the Middle East, Europe and in the United States, which in 2012 has experienced one of its worst [[epidemic]]s.

The main mode of WNV transmission is via various [[species]] of [[mosquito]]es which are the prime [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], with [[bird]]s being the most commonly infected animal and serving as the prime [[Host (biology)|reservoir host]] — especially  [[passerines]] which are of the largest order ([[Passeriformes]]) of birds. WNV has been found in various species of [[ticks]], but current research suggests they are not important vectors of the virus. WNV also infects various [[mammal]] [[species]], including  [[human]]s, and has been identified in [[Reptile|reptilian]] species, including [[alligator]]s and [[crocodile]]s, and also in [[amphibians]]. Not all animal species which are susceptible to WNV infection&nbsp;– humans included, and not all bird species develop sufficient viral levels to transmit the disease to uninfected mosquitoes, and are thus not considered major factors in WNV transmission.<ref name="Steinman 2003">{{Cite pmid|12899140}}</ref><ref name="Klenk 2004">{{Cite pmid| 15663852}}</ref>

Approximately 80% of West Nile virus infections in humans are [[Subclinical infection|subclinical]], which cause [[Asymptomatic|no symptoms]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.CDC.gov/ncidod/Dvbid/westnile/WNV_factsheet.htm |title=West Nile Virus: What You Need to Know CDC Fact Sheet  |publisher=www.CDC.gov |accessdate=2012-04-09 }}</ref> In the cases where symptoms do occur&nbsp;– termed West Nile fever in cases without neurological disease&nbsp;– the time from infection to the appearance of symptoms ([[incubation period]]) is typically between 2 and 15 days. Symptoms may include [[fever]], [[headache]]s, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[muscle pain]] or [[Muscle ache|aches]], [[malaise]], [[nausea]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[Emesis|vomiting]], [[myalgia]]s and [[rash]]. Less than 1% of the cases are severe and result in neurological disease when the [[central nervous system]] is affected. People of advanced age, the very young, or those with [[immunosuppression]], either medically induced, such as those taking [[immunosupressive drug]]s, or due to a pre-existing medical condition such as [[HIV/AIDS|HIV infection]], are most susceptible. The specific neurological diseases which may occur are West Nile [[encephalitis]], which causes [[inflammation]] of the [[Human brain|brain]], West Nile [[meningitis]], which causes inflammation of the [[meninges]] which are the protective [[membrane]]s that cover the brain and [[spinal cord]], West Nile meningoencephalitis, which causes inflammation of the brain and also the meninges surrounding it, and West Nile [[poliomyelitis]] — spinal cord inflammation which results in a syndrome similar to [[polio]], which may cause [[acute flaccid paralysis]].

Currently, no [[vaccine]] against WNV infection is available. The best method to reduce the rates of WNV infection is [[mosquito control]] on the part of municipalities, businesses and individual citizens to reduce breeding populations of mosquitoes in public, commercial and private areas via various means including eliminating standing pools of water where mosquitoes breed, such as in old [[tire]]s, buckets, disused [[swimming pool]]s, etc. On an individual basis, the use of personal protective measures to avoid being bitten by an infected mosquito, via the use of [[mosquito repellent]], [[window screen]]s, avoiding areas where mosquitoes are more prone to congregate, such as near [[marsh]]es, areas with heavy vegetation etc., and being more vigilant from dusk to dawn when mosquitoes are most active offers the best defense. In the event of being bitten by an infected mosquito, familiarity of the symptoms of WNV on the part of [[layperson]]s, [[physician]]s and [[allied health]] professionals affords the best chance of receiving timely medical treatment which may aid in reducing associated possible [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] and also appropriate [[palliative care]].

==Signs and symptoms==
The [[incubation period]] for WNV&nbsp;– the amount of time from infection to symptom onset&nbsp;– is typically from between 2 and 15 days.  Headache can be a prominent symptom of WNV fever, meningitis, encephalitis, menigoencephalitis and it may or may not be present in poliomyelytis-like syndrome thus headache is not a useful indicator of neuroinvasive disease.(CDC)

*'''West Nile fever (WNF)''', which occurs in 20 percent of cases, is a [[fever|febrile]] [[syndrome]] that causes [[flu-like symptoms]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Olejnik E |title=Infectious adenitis transmitted by ''Culex molestus |journal=Bull Res Counc Isr |volume=2 |pages=210–1 |year=1952}}</ref> Most characterizations of WNF generally describe it as a mild, [[acute (medicine)|acute]] syndrome lasting 3 to 6 days after symptom onset. Systematic follow-up studies of patients with WNF have not been done, so this information is largely [[Anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]]. In addition to a high fever, headache, chills, [[diaphoresis|excessive sweating]], weakness, fatigue, [[lymphadenopathy|swollen lymph nodes]], drowsiness, pain in the joints and [[flu-like symptoms]]. [[Gastrointestinal tract|Gastrointestinal]] symptoms which may occur include [[nausea]], [[emesis|vomiting]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]], and [[diarrhea]]. Fewer than one-third of patients develop a [[rash]].

*'''West Nile [[Neurotropic virus|neuroinvasive disease]] (WNND)''', which occurs in less than 1 percent of cases, is when the virus infects the [[central nervous system]] resulting in  [[meningitis]], [[encephalitis]], meningoencephalitis or a [[poliomyelitis]]-like syndrome.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal | author = Davis LE, DeBiasi R, Goade DE ''et al.'' | year = 2006 | month = Sep | title = West Nile virus neuroinvasive disease | journal = Ann Neurol | volume = 60 | issue = 3| pages = 286–300 | pmid = 16983682 | doi = 10.1002/ana.20959 }}</ref> Many patients with WNND have normal [[neuroimaging]] studies, although abnormalities may be present in various cerebral areas including the [[basal ganglia]], [[thalamus]], [[cerebellum]], and [[brainstem]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

*'''West Nile virus encephalitis (WNE)''' is the most common neuroinvasive manifestation of WNND. WNE presents with similar symptoms to other viral encephalitis with fever, headaches, and altered mental status. A prominent finding in WNE is [[muscular weakness]] (30 to 50 per cent of patients with encephalitis), often with [[lower motor neuron]] symptoms, [[flaccid paralysis]], and [[hyporeflexia]] with no [[Sensory system|sensory]] abnormalities.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Flores Anticona EM, Zainah H, Ouellette DR, Johnson LE |title=Two case reports of neuroinvasive west nile virus infection in the critical care unit |journal=Case Rep Infect Dis |volume=2012 |pages=839458 |year=2012 |pmid=22966470 |pmc=3433121 |doi=10.1155/2012/839458 }}</ref>"WNV is now the most common cause of epidemic viral encephalitis in the United States, and it will likely remain an important cause of neurological disease for the foreseeable future.("Carson PJ, ''et al.'' 2006)<ref name=Carson06>{{cite journal |author=Carson PJ, Konewko P, Wold KS, ''et al.'' |title=Long-term clinical and neuropsychological outcomes of West Nile virus infection |journal=Clin.

*'''West Nile meningitis (WNM)''' usually involves fever, headache, and stiff neck. Pleocytosis (?) is present. Changes in consciousness are not usually seen and are mild when present.

*'''West Nile meningoencephalitis''' is inflammation of both the brain (encephalitis) and meninges (meningitis).

*'''West Nile poliomyelitis (WNP)''', an [[acute flaccid paralysis]] syndrome associated with WNV infection, is less common than WNM or WNE. This syndrome is generally characterized by the acute onset of asymmetric limb weakness or paralysis in the absence of sensory loss. Pain sometimes precedes the paralysis. The paralysis can occur in the absence of fever, headache, or other common symptoms associated with WNV infection. Involvement of respiratory muscles, leading to acute respiratory failure, can sometimes occur.

*'''Cutaneous manifestations''' specifically rashes, are not uncommon in WNV-infected patients; however, there is a paucity of detailed descriptions in case reports and there are few clinical images widely available. Punctate erythematous (?), macular, and papular eruptions, most pronounced on the extremities have been observed in WNV cases and in some cases histopathologic findings have shown a sparse superficial [[perivascular]] lymphocytic infiltrate, a manifestation commonly seen in viral exanthems (?). A literature review provides support that this punctate rash is a common cutaneous presentation of WNV infection.

WNV is one of the [[Japanese encephalitis]] antigenic [[Serotype|serocomplex]] of viruses.
Image reconstructions and [[cryoelectron microscopy]] reveal a 45–50&nbsp;nm [[virion]] covered with a relatively smooth [[protein]] surface. This structure is similar to the [[dengue fever]] virus; both belong to the genus ''[[Flavivirus]]'' within the family ''[[Flaviviridae]]''. The genetic material of WNV is a [[Sense (molecular biology)|positive-sense]], single strand of [[RNA]], which is between 11,000 and 12,000 [[nucleotide]]s long; these [[genes]] encode seven nonstructural proteins and three structural proteins. The RNA strand is held within a nucleocapsid formed from 12-[[kDa]] protein blocks; the capsid is contained within a host-derived [[Biological membrane|membrane]] altered by two viral [[glycoprotein]]s.

The US virus was very closely related to a lineage 1 strain found in Israel in 1998. Since the first North American cases in 1999, the virus has been reported throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America. There have been human cases and equine cases, and many birds are infected. The [[Barbary macaque]], ''[[Macaca sylvanus]]'', was the first nonhuman [[primate]] to contract WNV.<ref>Hogan, C. Michael (2008). [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=31757 Barbary Macaque: Macaca sylvanus, GlobalTwitcher.com]</ref> Both the US and Israeli strains are marked by high mortality rates in infected avian populations; the presence of dead birds—especially [[Corvidae]]—can be an early indicator of the arrival of the virus.

===Transmission===
[[File:West Nile virus transmission cycle.jpg|thumb|The West Nile virus maintains itself in nature by cycling between mosquitoes and certain species of birds. A mosquito (the [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]) bites an uninfected bird (the [[Host (biology)|host]]), the virus amplifies within the bird, an uninfected mosquito bites the bird and is in turn infected. Other species such as humans and horses are incidental infections, as they are not the mosquitoes' preferred [[blood meal]] source. The virus does not amplify within these species and they are known as dead-end hosts. ]]
The West Nile virus (WNV) is transmitted through female mosquitoes, which are the prime [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of the virus. Only females feed on blood, and different species have evolved to take a [[blood meal]]  on preferred types of [[vertebrate]] [[Host (biology)|host]]s. The infected mosquito species vary according to geographical area; in the US, ''[[Culex pipiens]]'' (Eastern US), ''[[Culex tarsalis]]'' (Midwest and West), and ''[[Culex quinquefasciatus]]'' (Southeast) are the main sources.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hayes EB, Komar N, Nasci RS, Montgomery SP, O'Leary DR, Campbell GL|title=Epidemiology and transmission dynamics of West Nile virus disease |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=11|issue=8|pages=1167–73 |year=2005 |pmid=16102302 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no08/05-0289a.htm |doi=10.3201/eid1108.050289a |pmc=3320478}}</ref>

The various species that transmit the WNV prefer birds of the ''[[Passeriformes]]'' [[Order (biology)|order]], the largest order of birds. Within that order there is further selectivity with various mosquito species exhibiting preference for different [[species]]. In the United States WNV mosquito vectors have shown definitive preference for members of the''[[Corvidae]]'' and [[Thrush (bird)|Thrush]] [[Family (biology)|family]] of birds. Amongst the preferred [[species]] within these families are the  [[American crow]], a Corvid and the [[American Robin]] (''Turdus migratorius''), a thrush.
[[File:CulexNil.jpg|thumb|left| The [[proboscis]] of a female mosquito&nbsp;– here a Southern House Mosquito (''Culex quinquefasciatus'') — pierces the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and [[dermis]] to allow it to [[Blood meal|feed]] on human [[blood]] from a [[capillary]]: this one is almost fully engorged. The mosquito injects [[saliva]] which contains an [[anesthetic]], and an [[anticoagulant]] into the puncture wound; and in infected mosquitoes, the West Nile virus.]]
The birds develop sufficient viral levels after being infected, to transmit the infection to other biting mosquitoes which in turn go on to infect other birds. In crows and robins, the infection is fatal in 4–5 days. This [[epizootic]] viral amplification cycle has been shown to peak 15–16 days before humans become ill. This may be due to the high mortality, and thus depletion of the preferred hosts, i.e., the specific bird species. The mosquitoes become less selective and begin feeding more readily on other animal types such as humans and horses which are considered incidental hosts.<ref>{{cite web |title=First Evidence of West Nile Virus Amplification and relationship to Human Infection |format=PDF |publisher= |url=http://www.geography.hunter.cuny.edu/~carsi/INDEX/PUBLICATIONS/wnv_ijgis.pdf}}</ref>

In mammals, the virus does not multiply as readily (i.e. does not develop high [[viremia]] during infection), and mosquitoes biting infected mammals are not believed to ingest sufficient virus to become infected,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Taylor RM, Hurlbut HS, Dressler HR, Spangler EW, Thrasher D |title=Isolation of West Nile virus from Culex mosquitoes |journal=J Egypt Med Assoc |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=199–208 |year=1953 |pmid=13084817 }}</ref> making mammals so-called [[Host (biology)|dead-end hosts]].

====Vertical transmission====
[[Vertical transmission]]; the transmission of a viral or bacterial disease from the female of the species to her offspring, has been observed in various West Nile virus studies, amongst different species of mosquitoes in both the laboratory and in nature.<ref>{{cite journal | first = LM | last = Bugbee | coauthors = Forte LR | year = 2004 | month = September | title = The discovery of West Nile virus in overwintering ''Culex pipiens'' (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|journal = Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 326–7 | pmid = 15532939}}</ref> Mosquito progeny infected vertically in autumn, may potentially serve as a mechanism for WN virus to overwinter and initiate [[enzootic]] [[Horizontal disease transmission|horizontal]] transmission the following spring.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goddard LB, Roth AE, Reisen WK, Scott TW |title=Vertical transmission of West Nile Virus by three California Culex (Diptera: Culicidae) species |journal=J.

===Risk factors===
Risk factors independently associated with developing a clinical infection with WNV include a suppressed immune system and a patient history of organ transplantation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kumar D, Drebot MA, Wong SJ, ''et al.'' |title=A seroprevalence study of West Nile virus infection in solid organ transplant recipients |journal=Am.

A genetic factor also appears to increase susceptibility to West Nile disease. A mutation of the gene ''[[CCR5]]'' gives some protection against [[HIV]] but leads to more serious complications of WNV infection. Carriers of two mutated copies of ''CCR5'' made up 4.0 to 4.5% of a sample of West Nile disease sufferers, while the incidence of the gene in the general population is only 1.0%.<ref>{{cite journal | first = WG | last = Glass | coauthors = Lim JK, Cholera R, Pletnev AG, Gao JL, Murphy PM | year = 2005 | month = October 17 | title = Chemokine receptor CCR5 promotes leukocyte trafficking to the brain and survival in West Nile virus infection | journal = Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 202 | issue = 8 | pages = 1087–98 | pmid = 16230476 | doi = 10.1084/jem.20042530 | pmc = 2213214}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | first = WG | last = Glass | coauthors = McDermott DH, Lim JK, Lekhong S, Yu SF, Frank WA, Pape J, Cheshier RC, Murphy PM | year = 2006 | month = January 23 | title = CCR5 deficiency increases risk of symptomatic West Nile virus infection | journal = Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 203 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–40 | pmid = 16418398 | doi = 10.1084/jem.20051970 | pmc = 2118086}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:IgM.png|thumb|left|An [[IgM|Immunoglobulin M]] (IgM) [[antibody]] [[molecule]]. Definitive diagnosis of WNV is obtained through detection of virus-specific IgM and [[Neutralizing antibody|neutralizing antibodies]].]]
Preliminary diagnosis is often based on the patient's clinical symptoms, places and dates of travel (if patient is from a non-[[endemic]] country or area), activities, and [[epidemiology|epidemiologic]] history of the location where infection occurred. A recent history of mosquito bites and an acute febrile illness associated with neurologic signs and symptoms should cause clinical suspicion of WNV.

Diagnosis of West Nile Virus infections is generally accomplished by [[serology|serologic]] testing of [[blood serum]] or [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF), which is obtained via a [[lumbar puncture]].
Typical findings of WNV infection include [[lymphocytic pleocytosis]], elevated [[protein]] level, reference [[glucose]] and [[lactic acid]] levels, and no [[erythrocytes]].

Definitive diagnosis of WNV is obtained through detection of virus-specific [[antibody]] [[IgM|Immunoglobulin M]], (IgM) and [[Neutralizing antibody|neutralizing antibodies]]. Cases of West Nile virus meningitis and encephalitis which have been serologically confirmed produce similar degrees of CSF pleocytosis and are often associated with substantial CSF [[neutrophilia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tyler KL, Pape J, Goody RJ, Corkill M, Kleinschmidt-DeMasters BK |title=CSF findings in 250 patients with serologically confirmed West Nile virus meningitis and encephalitis |journal=Neurology |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=361–5 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16382032 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000195890.70898.1f }}</ref>
Specimens collected within 8 days following onset of illness may not test positive for West Nile IgM, and testing should be repeated.   A positive test for West Nile [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]] in the absence of a positive West Nile IgM is indicative of a previous flavavirus infection and is not by itself evidence of an acute West Nile virus infection.<ref>{{cite web |title=2012 DOHMH Advisory  #8: West Nile Virus |format=PDF |publisher=NYC |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/cd/2012/12md08.pdf}}</ref>

If cases of suspected West Nile virus infection, sera should be collected on both the acute and
convalescent phase of the illness.  Convalescent specimens should be collected 2–3 weeks after acute specimens.

It is common in serologic testing for [[cross-reactivity|cross-reactions]] to occur among flaviviruses such as [[Dengue virus]] (DENV) and [[tick-borne encephalitis virus]], this necessitates caution when evaluating serologic results of flaviviral infections.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Papa A, Karabaxoglou D, Kansouzidou A |title=Acute West Nile virus neuroinvasive infections: cross-reactivity with dengue virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus |journal=J. Med. Virol. |volume=83 |issue=10 |pages=1861–5 |year=2011 |month=October |pmid=21837806 |doi=10.1002/jmv.22180 }}</ref>

Four [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]-cleared WNV IgM [[ELISA]] kits are commercially available from different manufacturers in the U.S., each of these kits is indicated for use on serum to aid in the presumptive laboratory diagnosis of WNV infection in patients with clinical symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis. Positive WNV test kits obtained via use of these kits should be confirmed by additional testing at a state health department laboratory or CDC.

In fatal cases, [[nucleic acid]] amplification, [[histopathology]] with [[immunohistochemistry]] and virus culture of [[autopsy]] tissues can also be useful. Only a few state laboratories or other specialized laboratories, including those at CDC, are capable of doing this specialized testing
{{clear}}

===Differential diagnosis===
A number of various diseases may present with symptoms similar to those caused by a clinical West Nile virus infection. Those causing neuroinvasive disease symptoms include the [[enteroviruses|enterovirus infection]] and bacterial meningitis. Accounting for [[differential diagnoses]] is a crucial step in the definitive diagnosis of WNV infection. Consideration of a differential diagnosis is required when a patient presents with unexplained febrile illness, extreme headache, encephalitis or meningitis. Diagnostic and serologic laboratory testing utilizing [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR testing]] and [[viral culture]] of CSF to identify the specific pathogen causing the symptoms, is the only currently available means of differentiating between causes of encephalitis and meningitis.

==Prevention==
[[Image:Mosquito Netting.jpg|thumb|Low-cost, ceiling hung [[mosquito netting]] for a bed.]]
Personal protective measures can be taken to greatly reduce the risk of being bitten by an infected mosquito:
*Using insect repellent on exposed skin to repel mosquitoes. [[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA-registered]] repellents include products containing [[DEET]] (N,N-diethylmetatoluamide) and [[picaridin]] (KBR 3023). DEET concentrations of 30% to 50% are effective for several hours. Picaridin, available at 7% and 15% concentrations, needs more frequent application. DEET formulations as high as 50% are recommended for both adults and children over 2 months of age. Protect infants less than 2 months of age by using a carrier draped with [[mosquito netting]] with an elastic edge for a tight fit.
*When using [[sunscreen]], apply sunscreen first and then repellent. Repellent should be washed off at the end of the day before going to bed.
*Wear long-sleeved shirts which should be tucked in, long pants, and hats to cover exposed skin.
*The application of [[permethrin]]-containing (e.g., Permanone) or other insect repellents to clothing, shoes, tents, mosquito nets, and other gear for greater protection. Permethrin is not labeled for use directly on skin. Most repellent is generally removed from clothing and gear by a single washing, but permethrin-treated clothing is effective for up to 5 washings.
*Be aware that most mosquitoes that transmit disease are most active during twilight periods (dawn and dusk or in the evening). A notable exception is the [[Asian Tiger mosquito]] which is a daytime feeder and is more apt to be found in, or on the periphery of, shaded areas with heavy vegetation. They are now widespread in the United States and in states such as Florida they have been found in all 67 counties.<ref name=A_albopictus/>
*Staying in air-conditioned or well-[[Window screen|screened]] housing, and/or sleeping under an insecticide treated [[Mosquito net|bed net]]. Bed nets should be tucked under mattresses and can be sprayed with a repellent if not already treated with an insecticide.

===Monitoring and control===
West Nile virus can be sampled from the environment by the pooling of trapped mosquitoes via [[carbon dioxide]]-baited [[light trap]]s and [[gravid]] traps, testing blood samples drawn from wild birds, dogs and sentinel monkeys, as well as testing brains of dead birds found by various animal control agencies and the public.

Testing of the mosquito samples requires the use of [[RT-PCR]] to directly amplify and show the presence of virus in the submitted samples. When using the blood sera of wild birds and sentinel chickens, samples must be tested for the presence of WNV [[antibodies]] by use of [[immunohistochemistry]] (IHC)<ref>{{cite journal | first = M | last = Jozan | coauthors = Evans R, McLean R, Hall R, Tangredi B, Reed L, Scott J | year = 2003 | month = Fall | title = Detection of West Nile virus infection in birds in the United States by blocking ELISA and immunohistochemistry | journal = Vector-borne and Zoonotic Diseases |volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 99–110 | pmid = 14511579 | doi = 10.1089/153036603768395799}}</ref> or Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).<ref>{{cite journal | first = RA | last = Hall | coauthors = Broom AK, Hartnett AC, Howard MJ, Mackenzie JS | year = 1995 | month = February | title = Immunodominant epitopes on the NS1 protein of MVE and KUN viruses serve as targets for a blocking ELISA to detect virus-specific antibodies in sentinel animal serum | journal = Journal of Virological Methods | volume = 51 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 201–10 | pmid = 7738140 | doi = 10.1016/0166-0934(94)00105-P}}</ref>

Dead birds, after [[necropsy]], have their various tissues tested for virus by either [[RT-PCR]] or IHC, where virus shows up as brown-stained tissue because of a substrate-[[enzyme]] reaction.

West Nile control is achieved through [[mosquito control]], by elimination of mosquito breeding sites such as abandoned pools, applying [[larvacide]] to active breeding areas and targeting the adult population via [[aerial spraying]] of [[pesticide]]s.

[[Environmentalist]]s have condemned attempts to control the transmitting mosquitoes by spraying pesticide, saying the detrimental health effects of spraying outweigh the relatively few lives which may be saved, and more environmentally friendly ways of controlling mosquitoes are available. They also question the effectiveness of insecticide spraying, as they believe mosquitoes that are resting or flying above the level of spraying will not be killed; the most common vector in the northeastern US, ''Culex pipiens'', is a [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]] feeder.

==Treatment==
No specific treatment is available for WNV infection. In severe cases treatment consists of supportive care that often involves hospitalization, [[intravenous fluid]]s, respiratory support, and prevention of secondary infections.

==Prognosis==
While the general prognosis is favorable, current studies indicate that West Nile Fever can often be more severe than previously recognized, with studies of various recent outbreaks indicating that it may take as long as 60–90 days to recover.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Watson JT, Pertel PE, Jones RC, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical characteristics and functional outcomes of West Nile Fever |journal=Ann.

The first appearance of WNV in the Western Hemisphere was in 1999<ref name=Nash01/>  with encephalitis reported in humans, dogs, cats, and horses, and the subsequent spread in the [[United States]] may be an important milestone in the evolving history of this virus. The American outbreak began in [[College Point, Queens]] in [[New York City]] and was later spread to the neighboring states of [[New Jersey]] and [[Connecticut]].

West Nile virus is now [[endemic]] in [[Africa]], [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]], west and central [[Asia]], [[Oceania]] (subtype [[Kunjin virus|Kunjin]]), and most recently, North America and is spreading into Central and South America.

Recent outbreaks of West Nile virus encephalitis in humans have occurred in [[Algeria]] (1994), [[Romania]] (1996 to 1997), the [[Czech Republic]] (1997), [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] (1998), [[Russia]] (1999), the United States (1999 to 2009), Canada (1999–2007), [[Israel]] (2000) and [[Greece]] (2010).

[[Epizootic]]s of disease in horses occurred in [[Morocco]] (1996), [[Italy]] (1998), the United States (1999 to 2001), and [[France]] (2000), Mexico (2003) and [[Sardinia]] (2011).

==Research==
A vaccine for horses ([[ATCvet]] code: {{ATCvet|I05|AA10}}) based on killed viruses exists; some [[zoo]]s have given this vaccine to their birds, although its effectiveness is unknown. Dogs and cats show few if any signs of infection. There have been no known cases of direct canine-human or feline-human transmission; although these pets can become infected, it is unlikely they are, in turn, capable of infecting native mosquitoes and thus continuing the disease cycle.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vertebrate Ecology |date=30 April 2009 |work=West Nile Virus |publisher=Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, CDC |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/birds&mammals.htm}}</ref>
