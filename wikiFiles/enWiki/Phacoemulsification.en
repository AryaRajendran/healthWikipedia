'''Phacoemulsification''' refers to modern [[cataract surgery]] in which the [[human eye|eye]]'s internal [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] is [[emulsion|emulsified]] with an [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] handpiece and aspirated from the eye. Aspirated fluids are replaced with irrigation of [[balanced salt solution]], thus maintaining the [[Anterior chamber of eyeball|anterior chamber]], as well as cooling the handpiece.

==Etymology==
phaco- (< Gk phako-, comb. form of phakÃ³s lentil; see lens ) + emulsification<ref>http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Phacoemulsification</ref>

==Preparation and precautions==
Being a delicate organ, the eye requires extreme care before, during and after a surgical procedure. An [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] must diagnose a [[cataract]] and conduct or supervise the operation. University programs typically allow patients to specify if they want to be operated upon by the consultant or the resident or fellow. 

Proper anesthesia is a must for ocular surgery. [[Topical anesthetic|Topical anesthesia]] is most commonly employed, typically by the instillation of a [[local anesthetic]] such as [[tetracaine]] or [[lidocaine]]. Alternatively, lidocaine and/or longer-acting [[bupivacaine]] anesthestic may be injected into the area surrounding ([[Nerve block|peribulbar block]]) or behind ([[retrobulbar block]]) the eye muscle cone to more fully immobilize the [[extraocular muscles]] and minimize pain sensation. A [[facial nerve]] block using lidocaine and bupivacaine may occasionally be performed to reduce lid squeezing. [[General anaesthesia|General anesthesia]] is recommended for children, traumatic eye injuries with cataract, for very apprehensive or uncooperative patients and animals. Cardiovascular monitoring is preferable in [[local anesthesia]] and is mandatory in the setting of general anesthesia. Proper sterile precautions are taken to prepare the area for surgery, including use of antiseptics like [[povidone-iodine]]. Sterile drapes, gowns and gloves are employed. A plastic sheet with a receptacle helps collect the fluids during phacoemulsification. An eye [[Speculum (medical)|speculum]] is inserted to keep the eyelids open.

==Surgical technique==

Before the phacoemulsification can be performed, one or more incisions are made in the eye to allow the introduction of [[surgical instrument]]s. The surgeon then removes the anterior face of the capsule that contains the lens inside the eye. Phacoemulsification surgery involves the use of a machine with microprocessor-controlled [[fluid dynamics]]. These can be based on [[Peristalsis|peristaltic]] or a [[Aspirator|venturi]] type of pump. 

The phaco probe is an ultrasonic handpiece with a [[titanium]] or [[steel]] needle. The tip of the needle vibrates at ultrasonic frequency to sculpt and emulsify the cataract while the pump aspirates particles through the tip. In some techniques, a second fine steel instrument called a "chopper" is used from a side port to help with chopping the nucleus into smaller pieces. The cataract is usually broken into two or four pieces and each piece is emulsified and aspirated out with suction. The nucleus emulsification makes it easier to aspirate the particles. After removing all hard central lens nucleus with phacoemulsification, the softer outer lens cortex is removed with suction only. 

An irrigation-aspiration probe or a bimanual system is used to aspirate out the remaining peripheral cortical matter, while leaving the posterior capsule intact. As with other cataract extraction procedures, an [[intraocular lens|intraocular lens implant]] (IOL), is placed into the remaining lens capsule. For implanting a PMMA IOL, the incision has to be enlarged. For implanting a foldable IOL, the incision does not have to be enlarged. The foldable IOL, made of [[silicone]] or acrylic of appropriate power is folded either using a holder/folder, or a proprietary insertion device provided along with the IOL. 

It is then inserted and placed in the posterior chamber in the capsular bag (in-the-bag implantation). Sometimes, a sulcus implantation may be required because of posterior capsular tears or because of zonular dialysis.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacoemulsification | title = Management of zonular dialysis in phacoemulsification and IOL implantation using the capsular tension ring. | accessdate = 2011-09-07}}</ref> Because a smaller incision is required, few or no stitches are needed and the patient's recovery time is usually shorter when using a foldable IOL.<ref>[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Pa-St/Phacoemulsification-for-Cataracts.html Surgery Encyclopedia - Phacoemulsification for cataracts]</ref><ref>[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Ce-Fi/Extracapsular-Cataract-Extraction.html Surgery Encyclopedia - Extracapsular cataract extraction]</ref>

==History==
[[Charles Kelman]] introduced phacoemulsification in 1967 after being inspired by his dentist's ultrasonic probe.
