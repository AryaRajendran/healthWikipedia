The '''Lazarus sign''' or '''Lazarus reflex''' is a [[reflex]] movement in [[brain-dead]] or [[Brain stem death|brainstem failure]] patients,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://medethics.org.eg/ESME/e-brain_death5.htm |publisher=The Egyptian Society of Medical Ethics  |year=2009 |title=Brain death and brainstem failure |accessdate=August 26, 2011}}</ref> which causes them to briefly raise their arms and drop them crossed on their chests (in a position similar to some [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian [[mummies]]).<ref name=Han>{{cite journal|year=2006|author=S.G Han et. al|title= Reflex Movements in Patients with Brain Death: A Prospective Study in A Tertiary Medical Center|journal=Journal of Korean medical science|pages=588–90|issn=1011-8934|pmid=16778413|volume=21|issue=3|pmc=2729975}}</ref><ref name=Ropper>{{cite journal|year=1984|title=Unusual spontaneous movements in brain-dead patients|author=Allan H Ropper|journal=Neurology|url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/34/8/1089?ijkey=06e05d11bada7b6a4b70f962591dfd2d96b3d91a&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha|pmid=6540387|volume=34|issue=8|pages=1089–90}}</ref> The phenomenon is named after the Biblical character [[Lazarus of Bethany]],<ref name=Machado /> whom [[Jesus]] is described as having raised from the dead in the [[Gospel of John]].

==How it happens==

Like the [[knee jerk]] reflex, the Lazarus sign is an example of a reflex mediated by a [[reflex arc]] – a [[neural pathway]] which passes via the [[spinal column]] but not through the brain. As a consequence the movement is possible in brain-dead patients whose organs have been kept functioning by life-support machines, precluding the use of complex involuntary motions as a test for brain activity.<ref name=Ropper /> It has been suggested by [[neurologists]] studying the phenomenon that increased awareness of this and similar reflexes "may prevent delays in brain-dead diagnosis and misinterpretations."<ref name=Han />

The reflex is often preceded by slight shivering motions of the patient's arms, or the appearance of [[goose bumps]] on the arms and torso. The arms then begin to flex at the elbows before lifting to be held above the [[Human sternum|sternum]]. They are often brought from here towards the neck or chin and touch or cross over. Short exhalations have also been observed coinciding with the action.<ref name=Ropper />

== Occurrences ==

The phenomenon has been observed to occur several minutes after the removal of [[medical ventilator]]s used to pump air in and out of brain-dead patients to keep their bodies alive.<ref name=Machado /> It also occurs during testing for [[apnea]] – that is, suspension of external breathing and motion of the lung muscles - which is one of the criteria for determining brain death used for example by the [[American Academy of Neurology]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[American Academy of Neurology]]|url=http://www.aan.com/professionals/practice/pdfs/pdf_1995_thru_1998/1995.45.1012.pdf|title=Practice Parameters: Determining Brain Death in Adults|year=1994|accessdate=12 July 2009}}</ref>

Occurrences of the Lazarus sign in [[intensive-care unit]]s have been mistaken for evidence of resuscitation of patients. They may frighten those who witness the movement, and have been viewed by some as [[Miracle|miraculous]] events.<ref name=Ropper />
