'''Louis Robinson''' was a 19th Century [[England|English]] [[physician]], [[paediatrician]] and [[author]]. An ardent [[evolutionist]], he helped pioneer modern child medicine during the later [[Victorian era]], writing prolifically in journals on the emerging science of [[paediatrics]].<ref>See ''The Nineteenth Century'', ''Journal of Anatomy'' and ''British Medical Journal'' amongst others</ref> Active in scientific debate, Robinson was critiqued in some parts of the press for his outspoken evolutionary views in the wider debate between [[human evolution|scientific theories of human origin]] and the [[Genesis creation narrative|religious view]].

==Early life==

Born 8 August 1857 to a [[Quaker]] family in [[Saddlescombe]] near [[Brighton]], Robinson was educated at Quaker schools in [[Ackworth, West Yorkshire|Ackworth]] and [[York]]. His younger sister was the English novelist [[Maude Robinson]]. He went on to study medicine in [[London]] (at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]]) and [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], before graduating top of his class in 1889. He was married the previous year to Edith Aline Craddock, with whom he went to have four children.

==Medical career==

Drawing on his extensive research, Robinson's interest in evolution was expressed in a series of articles,<ref>Examples include: "Darwinism in the Nursery" (1891), "The Meaning of a Baby's Footprint" (1892), "Darwinism and Swimming: a theory" (1893), "Evolution and the Amateur Naturalist" (1897), "Eye Language: the natural history of Ocular Expression" (1898)</ref> which led to an appearance before the [[British Association]] at [[Edinburgh]] to present his paper "The Prehensile Power of Infants".<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E05E6DF1538E233A25751C2A9639C94639ED7CF ''A Baby's Footprint''], [[The New York Times]], May 22, 1892</ref> A keen practitioner as well as theorist, Robinson was one of the first doctors of his era to conduct experiments with young babies, testing over sixty subjects immediately after birth on their power of grip.<ref>An account of this is provided in ''Science in the Nineteenth-Century Periodical'' (2004), by Cantor, Dawson and Gooday: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q50m1PCOcZ8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:%22Journalism,+Scientific%3B+Great+Britain%3B+History%3B+19th+century.%22&sig=ACfU3U02PBPq9_zpp4tMKvsOg3DxsYuFZQ</ref> This echoed the approach of the pioneering German physician [[Adolph Kussmaul]].

==Later years==

Following a series of [[lectures]] at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] on [[vestigial]] [[reflexes]], he was sought after to teach in both [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[United States|American]] universities, and increasingly noticed by prominent scientists like [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]], [[John Scott Burdon-Sanderson|Burdon-Sanderson]] and [[William Henry Flower|Flower]]. However, Robinson opted to focus on his work as a doctor in [[Streatham]]. Nonetheless, he continued his research, employing several assistants, and leading to his publication of a volume on evolution that focused on [[ethology|animal behaviour]].<ref>Robinson, L (1897) ''Wild Traits in Tame Animals'': William Blackwood & Sons, Edinburgh</ref>
