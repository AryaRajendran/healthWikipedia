A '''douche''' {{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|d|uː|ʃ}} is a device used to introduce a stream of water into the body for medical or hygienic reasons, or the stream of water itself.

Douche usually refers to '''vaginal irrigation''', the rinsing of the [[vagina]], but it can also refer to the rinsing of any body cavity. A '''douche bag''' is a piece of equipment for douching—a bag for holding the fluid used in douching. To avoid transferring intestinal bacteria into the vagina, the same bag must not be used for an [[enema]] and a vaginal douche.

== Etymology ==
First Known Use: 1766
The word ''[[wikt:douche#French|douche]]'' came to English via [[French language|French]], from {{lang-it|doccia}} "conduit pipe" and {{lang|it|''docciare''}} "pour by drops" to douche, from doccia water pipe, probably back-formation from doccione conduit, from Latin duction-, ductio means of conveying water, from ducere to lead – where today it means ''[[shower]]''.<ref>http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/douche</ref>

Vaginal douches may consist of water, water mixed with [[vinegar]], or even [[antiseptic]] chemicals. Douching has been touted as having a number of supposed but unproven benefits. In addition to promising to clean the vagina of unwanted odors, it can also be used by women who wish to avoid smearing a sexual partner's penis with menstrual blood while having [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] during [[menstruation]]. In the past, douching was also used after intercourse as a method of [[birth control]], though it is not effective (see below).

Many health care professionals state that douching is dangerous, as it interferes with both the vagina's normal self-cleaning and with the natural bacterial culture of the vagina, and it might spread or introduce infections. Douching is implicated in a wide variety of dangers, including: adverse pregnancy outcomes including [[ectopic pregnancy]], [[low birth weight]], preterm labor, [[preterm birth]], and [[chorioamnionitis]]; serious gynecologic outcomes, including increased risk of [[cervical cancer]], [[pelvic inflammatory disease]], [[endometritis]], and increased risk for [[sexually transmitted infections]], including [[HIV]]; it also predisposes women to develop [[bacterial vaginosis]] (BV),<ref name="slate">{{cite website | url = http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2013/01/microbial_balance_in_vagina_miscarriage_infertility_pre_term_birth_linked.html | title = What’s in Your Vagina? A healthy microbiome, hopefully. | first = Moises | last = Velasquez-Manoff | date = Jan. 11, 2013 | work = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] }}</ref> which is further associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and increased risk of sexually transmitted infections.<ref name="Cottrell">{{cite pmid|20215951}}</ref> Due to this, the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] strongly discourages douching, citing the risks of irritation, bacterial vaginosis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Frequent douching with water may result in an imbalance of the [[pH]] of the vagina, and thus may put women at risk for possible vaginal infections, especially yeast infections.<ref>[http://women.webmd.com/tc/Vaginal-Problems-Home-Treatment WebMD article on the causes of yeast infections, including douching.]</ref>

In May 2003, a randomized, controlled, multi-center study was conducted with 1827 women ages 18–44 who were regular users of a douche product and who had been treated recently for a sexually transmitted bacterial infection or bacterial vaginosis. Women were randomly assigned to use either a newly designed and marketed douche product or a soft cloth towelette. There was little or no indication of a greater risk of PID among women assigned to use the douche product (versus soft cloth towelette). Douching may be related to a lower probability that a woman becomes pregnant.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rothman KJ, Funch DP, Alfredson T, Brady J, Dreyer NA|title=Randomized field trial of vaginal douching, pelvic inflammatory disease and pregnancy|journal=Epidemiology |volume=14|issue=3|pages=340–8|year=2003|month=May|pmid=12859036|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1044-3983&volume=14&issue=3&spage=340|doi=10.1097/00001648-200305000-00015}}</ref>

Antiseptics may also result in an imbalance of the natural bacteria in the vagina, also resulting in an increased likelihood of infection.<ref name=sciencenews>{{cite journal |last=Seppa |first=N. |title=Douching associated with pregnancy risk |journal=Science News |date=2 January 1999 |volume=155 |issue=1 |page=7 |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/pdfs/data/1999/15501/15501-12.pdf |accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref> Furthermore, unclean douching equipment may also introduce undesirable foreign bodies into the vagina. For these reasons, the practice of douching is now strongly discouraged except when ordered by a physician for specific medical reasons.<ref name="sciencenews"/> Douching may also wash bacteria into the [[uterus]] and [[Fallopian tubes]], causing fertility problems.<ref>[http://health.ivillage.com/gynoperiod/prhygiene/0,,4r3b,00.html Warning from Kelly Shanahan, MD on douching.]</ref>

Douching after intercourse is estimated to reduce the chances of conception by only 15–25%.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} In comparison, proper [[condom]] use reduces the chance of conception by as much as 97%. In some cases douching may force the [[ejaculate]] further into the [[vagina]], increasing the chance of pregnancy. A review of studies by researchers at the [[University of Rochester Medical Center]] (N.Y.) showed that women who douched regularly and later became pregnant had higher rates of [[ectopic pregnancy]], [[infection]]s, and low birth weight infants than women who only douched occasionally or who never douched.<ref name="sciencenews"/>

A 1995 survey quoted in the [[University of Rochester]] study found that 27% of U.S. women age 15 to 44 douched regularly, but that douching was more common among African-American women (over 50%) than among white women (21%),<ref name="sciencenews"/> and higher douching is cited as a reason for the higher prevalence of bacterial vaginosis among African-American women, compared to the population at large.<ref name="slate" />

==Slang uses==
''Douche bag'', or simply ''douche'', is considered to be a [[pejorative]] term. The slang usage of the term originated in the 1960s.<ref>[http://www.drbilllong.com/SpellersDiary/Interlude.html Terms of Derogation]</ref>
