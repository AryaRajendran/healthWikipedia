In [[orthopedics]], a '''varus deformity''' is a term for the inward angulation of the distal segment of a bone or joint.  The opposite of varus is called [[valgus deformity|valgus]].

The terms varus and valgus always refer to the direction that the [[distal]] segment of the joint points.

For example, in a '''varus''' deformity of the knee, the distal part of the leg below the knee is deviated ''inward'', resulting in a ''[[bowlegged]]'' appearance.  Conversely, a ''valgus'' deformity at the knee results in a ''[[knock-kneed]]'' appearance, with the distal part of the leg deviated ''outward''.

==Terminology==
The terminology is made confusing by the '''etymology''' of these words.

*Application of these words in adjectival form to other portions of the body by the medical community has resulted in their definitions changing so that they now refer to the angle of the distal segment (i.e. valgus impaction in a Garden I femoral neck fracture).
*It is correct for a knock-kneed deformity to be called both a ''varus'' deformity at the hip (''coxa vara'') and a ''valgus'' deformity at the knee (''genu valgum''); although the common terminology is to simply refer to it as a ''valgus'' knee.

If this is confusing, just remember that "varus = inward" and "valgus = outward" and always refers to the direction that the distal part of the joint points.
The English-speaking orthopedist's mnemonic is: valgus with a ''g'' as in ''gum'' means knees that stick together, and varus means a variance or divergence.  Another mnemonic is that ''varus'' (which sounds like "v-AIR-us") means "more AIR between your legs".

When the terminology refers to a bone rather than a joint, the distal segment of the bone is being described.  Thus, a varus deformity of the tibia (i.e. a mid-shaft tibial fracture with varus deformity) refers to the distal segment in a varus alignment compared to the proximal segment.

==Examples==
*'''Hip:''' ''[[coxa vara]]'' &mdash;  the angle between the head and the shaft of the femur is reduced, resulting in a limp.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1259556-overview |title=Congenital Coxa Vera: eMedicine Orthopedic Surgery}}</ref>
*'''Knee:''' ''[[genu varum]]'' (from Latin ''genu'' = knee) &mdash; the tibia is turned inward in relation to the femur, resulting in a bowlegged deformity.
*'''Ankle:''' ''[[talipes equinovarus]]'' (from Latin ''talus'' = ankle and ''pes'' = foot) &mdash; inward turning of the heel, resulting in clubfoot with the person walking on the outer part of the foot.
*'''Toe:''' ''[[hallux varus]]'' (Latin ''hallux'' = big toe) &mdash; inward deviation of the big toe away from the second toe.

*'''Elbows:''' ''[[cubitus varus]]'' (Latin ''cubitus'' = elbow) &mdash; turned inward elbows
