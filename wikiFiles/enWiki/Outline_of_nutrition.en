The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to nutrition:

'''[[Nutrition]]''' (also called '''nutrition science''') &ndash; studies the relationship between [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and states of [[health]] and [[disease]]. The scope of nutrition science ranges from [[malnutrition]] to optimal health.  Many common symptoms and diseases can often be prevented or alleviated with better nutrition.
