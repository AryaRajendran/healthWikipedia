A '''rectovaginal fistula''' is a medical condition where there is a [[fistula]] or abnormal connection between the [[rectum]] and the [[vagina]].<ref name="pmid16221302">{{cite journal |author=Kumaran SS, Palanivelu C, Kavalakat AJ, Parthasarathi R, Neelayathatchi M |title=Laparoscopic repair of high rectovaginal fistula: Is it technically feasible? |journal=BMC Surg |volume=5|pages=20 |year=2005 |pmid=16221302 |pmc=1266383 |doi=10.1186/1471-2482-5-20 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2482/5/20}}</ref>

Rectovaginal fistula may be extremely debilitating. If the opening between the rectum and vagina is wide it will allow both [[flatulence]] and [[feces]] to escape through the vagina, leading to [[fecal incontinence]]. There is an association with recurrent urinary and vaginal infections. This type of fistula can cause pediatricians to misdiagnose [[imperforate anus]]. The severity of the symptoms will depend on the size of fistula. Most often, it appears after about one week or so following delivery.

==Causes==
Rectovaginal fistulae are often the result of trauma during childbirth (in which case it is known as [[obstetric fistula]]) in situations where there is inadequate health care, such as in some [[developing countries]]. Risk factors include prolonged labour, difficult instrumental delivery and paramedian episiotomy. Rates in [[Eritrea]] are estimated as high as 350 per 100,000 vaginal births. Fistulas can also develop in women and children who are raped; women with rectovaginal fistulae are often stigmatized in third world countries, and become outcasts.<ref>http://www.msmagazine.com/spring2005/congo.asp</ref>

Rectovaginal fistulae can also be a symptom of various diseases, including infection by [[lymphogranuloma venereum]],<ref name="pmid10449269">{{cite journal |author=Lynch CM, Felder TL, Schwandt RA, Shashy RG |title=Lymphogranuloma venereum presenting as a rectovaginal fistula |journal=Infect Dis Obstet Gynecol |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=199â€“201 |year=1999 |pmid=10449269 |pmc=1784745 |doi=10.1155/S1064744999000344}}</ref> or the unintended result of surgery, such as [[episiotomy]] or [[sexual reassignment surgery]].   They may present as a complication of vaginal surgery, including vaginal [[hysterectomy]]. They are a recognized presentation of rectal [[carcinoma]] or rarely [[diverticular disease]] of the bowel or [[Crohn's]] disease.  They are seen rarely after [[radiotherapy]] treatment for [[cervical cancer]].

==Treatment==
After diagnosing rectovaginal fistula, it is best to wait for around 3 months to allow the inflammation to subside. If the fistula is small, it will heal spontaneously during this time interval. For low fistulae, a vaginal approach is best, while an abdominal repair would be necessary for a high fistula at the posterior fornix.<br />
A circular incision is made around the fistula and vagina is separated from the underlying rectum with a sharp circumferential dissection. The entire fistulous tract, along with a small rim of rectal mucosa is incised. The rectal wall is then closed extramucosally.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rectovaginal fistula: Treatment and Management|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/193277-treatment|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref>
