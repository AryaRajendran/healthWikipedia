'''Ophthalmology''' is the branch of [[medicine]] that deals with the anatomy, physiology and diseases of the [[human eye|eye]]. An '''ophthalmologist''' is a specialist in medical and surgical eye problems. Since ophthalmologists perform operations on eyes, they are both [[surgery|surgical]] and [[medicine|medical]] specialists.

==Etymology==

The word ''ophthalmology'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] roots ''ophthalmos'' meaning ''eye'' and ''logos'' meaning ''word'', ''thought,'' or ''discourse''; ophthalmology literally means "the science of eyes". As a discipline, it applies to animal eyes also, since the differences from human practice are surprisingly minor and are related mainly to differences in anatomy or prevalence, not differences in disease processes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==History==

===Ancient India===
[[Image:Shushrut statue.jpg|thumb|240px|Statue of Sushruta (सुश्रुत) in Patanjali Yogpeeth, Haridwar]]
The Indian surgeon [[Sushruta]] wrote ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'' in [[Sanskrit]] in about 800 <small>BC</small> which describes 76 ocular diseases (of these 51 surgical) as well as several ophthalmological surgical instruments and techniques.<ref>Bidyadhar, N.K. (1939), Sushruta's Ophthalmic Operations, [[Archives of Ophthalmology]], 22, page 553.</ref><ref>Agarwal, R.K.

===Pre-Hippocrates===
The pre-[[Hippocrates|Hippocratics]] largely based their anatomical conceptions of the eye on speculation, rather than [[empiricism]]. They recognized the sclera and transparent cornea running flushly as the outer coating of the eye, with an inner layer with pupil, and a fluid at the centre. It was believed, by [[Alcamaeon]] and others, that this fluid was the medium of vision and flowed from the eye to the brain via a tube. [[Aristotle]] advanced such ideas with empiricism. He dissected the eyes of animals, and discovering three layers (not two), found that the fluid was of a constant consistency with the lens forming (or congealing) after death, and the surrounding layers were seen to be juxtaposed. He, and his contemporaries, further put forth the existence of three tubes leading from the eye, not one. One tube from each eye met within the skull.

===Rufus===
[[Rufus of Ephesus]] recognised a more modern eye, with [[conjunctiva]], extending as a fourth epithelial layer over the eye. Rufus was the first to recognise a two chambered eye; with one chamber from cornea to lens (filled with water), the other from lens to retina (filled with an egg-white-like substance). The Greek physician [[Galen]] remedied some mistakes including the curvature of the cornea and lens, the nature of the optic nerve, and the existence of a [[posterior chamber of eyeball|posterior chamber]].

Though this model was a roughly correct modern model of the eye, it contained errors. Still, it was not advanced upon again until after [[Vesalius]]. A [[ciliary body]] was then discovered and the sclera, retina, choroid and cornea were seen to meet at the same point. The two chambers were seen to hold the same fluid as well as the lens being attached to the choroid. Galen continued the notion of a central canal, but he dissected the optic nerve and saw that it was solid. He mistakenly counted seven optical muscles, one too many. He also knew of the [[tear duct]]s.

===Middle Eastern ophthalmology===
{{Main|Ophthalmology in medieval Islam}}

Medieval Islamic scientists (unlike their classical predecessors) considered it normal to combine theory and practice, including the crafting of precise instruments, and therefore found it natural to combine the study of the eye with the practical application of that knowledge.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Science in the Middle Ages|author=David C. Lindberg|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1980|isbn=0-226-48233-2|page=21|authorlink=David C. Lindberg}}</ref>

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) wrote extensively on [[optics]] and the [[anatomy]] of the eye in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021).

[[Ibn al-Nafis]] wrote a large textbook, ''The Polished Book on Experimental Ophthalmology'', divided into two parts, ''On the Theory of Opthalmology'' and ''Simple and Compounded Opthalmic Drugs''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures|editor=Helaine Selin|author=David C. Lindberg|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|year=1997|isbn=0792340663|page=410}}</ref>

===17th and 18th centuries===
[[Image:François Pourfour du Petit.jpg|thumb|170px|François Pourfour du Petit]]
The 17th and 18th century saw the use of [[hand lens]]es (by [[Malpighi]]), [[microscope]]s (van Leeuwenhoek), preparations for fixing the eye for study ([[Frederik Ruysch|Ruysch]]) and later the freezing of the eye ([[Francois Pourfour du Petit|Petit]]). This allowed for detailed study of the eye and an advanced model. Some mistakes persisted such as: why the pupil changed size (seen to be vessels of the iris filling with blood), the existence of the [[posterior chamber of eyeball|posterior chamber]], and of course the nature of the retina. In 1722 [[Leeuwenhoek]] noted the existence of rods and cones{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} though they were not properly discovered until [[Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus]] in 1834 by use of a microscope.

[[Georg Joseph Beer]] (1763–1821) was an Austrian ophthalmologist and leader of the First Viennese School of Medicine. He introduced a flap operation for treatment of [[cataract]]s ([[Beer's operation]]), as well as popularizing the instrument used to perform the surgery (Beer's knife).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U2Iigywli08C&printsec=titlepage&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0|Fuchs |title=Fuchs, Ernst, and Alexander Duane.Text-book of Ophthalmology.

===Ophthalmic surgery in Great Britain===
The first ophthalmic surgeon in Great Britain was [[John Freke]], appointed to the position by the Governors of [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] in 1727.  A major breakthrough came with the appointment of  Baron Michael Johann Baptist de Wenzel (1724–90), a German who became oculist to King George III of England in 1772. His skill at removing cataracts legitimized the field.<ref>A.L. Wyman, "Baron De Wenzel, Oculist to King George III: His Impact on British Ophthalmologists," ''Medical History'' (1991) 35#1 pp 78-88.</ref>  The first dedicated ophthalmic hospital opened in 1805 in London; it is now called [[Moorfields Eye Hospital]].  Clinical developments at Moorfields and the founding of the Institute of Ophthalmology (now part of the [[University College London]]) by [[Stewart Duke-Elder|Sir Stewart Duke Elder]] established the site as the largest eye hospital in the world and a nexus for ophthalmic research.<ref>Luke Davidson, "'Identities Ascertained': British Ophthalmology in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century," ''Social History of Medicine'' (1996) 9#3 pp p313-333.</ref>

===20th century===
The  prominent opticians of the late 19th and early 20th century included  [[Ernst Abbe]] (1840–1905), a co-owner of  at the Zeiss Jena factories in Germany where he developed numerous optical instruments. [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1821-1894) was a polymath who made contributions to many fields of science and invented the [[ophthalmoscope]] in 1851. They both made theoretical calculations on image formation in optical systems and had also studied the optics of the eye.

===Central Europe===
Numerous ophthalmologists fled Germany after 1933 as the nazis persecuted Jews.  A representative leader was [[Joseph Igersheimer]] (1879–1965), best known for his discoveries with arsphenamine for the treatment of syphilis.  He fled to Turkey in 1933. As one of eight emigrant directors in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Istanbul, he built a modern clinic and trained students. In 1939 he went to the United States, becoming a professor at Tufts University.<ref>Arin Namal, and Arnold Reisman, "Joseph Igersheimer (1879–1965): A Visionary Ophthalmologist and his Contributions before and after Exile," ''Journal of Medical Biography'' (2007) 15#4 pp 227–234</ref>

Polish  ophthalmology dates to the 13th century. The Polish Ophthalmological Society was founded in 1911. A representative leader was [[Adam Zamenhof]] (1888–1940), who introduced certain diagnostic, surgical and nonsurgical eye-care procedures and was shot by the Nazis in 1940.<ref>Andrzej  Wincewicz, et al., "Dr Adam Zamenhof (1888-1940) and his insight into ophthalmology," ''Journal of Medical Biography '' (2009) 17#1 pp 18–22</ref> Zofia Falkowska (1915–93) head of the Faculty and Clinic of Ophthalmology in Warsaw from 1963 to 1976, was the first to use lasers in her practice.

==Professional requirements==
Ophthalmologists are [[physicians]] ([[Doctor of Medicine|MD/MBBS]] or [[D.O.]], not [[Doctor of Optometry|OD or BOptom]]) who have completed a college degree, [[medical school]], and [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in ophthalmology. In many countries, ophthalmologists also undergo additional specialized training in one of the many subspecialties. Ophthalmology was the first branch of medicine to offer [[board certification]], now a standard practice among all specialties.

===Australia and New Zealand===
In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the FRACO/FRANZCO is the equivalent postgraduate specialist qualification. It is a very competitive speciality to enter training and has a closely monitored and structured training system in place over the five years of postgraduate training. Overseas-trained ophthalmologists are assessed using the pathway published on the RANZCO website. Those who have completed their formal training in the UK and have the CCST/CCT are usually deemed to be comparable.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], an ophthalmology residency after medical school is undertaken. The residency lasts a minimum of five years after the MD degree although subspecialty training is undertaken by about 30% of fellows (FRCSC). There are about 35 vacancies per year for ophthalmology training in all of Canada.

===Finland===
In [[Finland]], physicians willing to become ophthalmologists must undergo a five year specialization which includes practical training and theoretical studies.

===India===
In [[India]], after completing MBBS degree, post-graduation in ophthalmology is required. The degrees are Doctor of Medicine (MD), Master of Surgery (MS), Diploma in Ophthalmic Medicine and Surgery (DOMS), and Diplomate of National Board (DNB). The concurrent training and work experience is in the form of a junior residency at a medical college, eye hospital or institution under the supervision of experienced faculty. Further work experience in form of fellowship, registrar or senior resident refines the skills of these eye surgeons. All India Ophthalmological Society (AIOS) and various state level ophthalmological societies (like DOS) hold regular conferences and actively promote continuing medical education.

===Pakistan===
In [[Pakistan]], after an MBBS, a four-year full-time residency programme leads to an exit level FCPS examinations in ophthalmology, held under the auspices of the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Pakistan. The tough examination is assessed by both highly qualified Pakistani & eminent international ophthalmic consultants. As a prerequisite to the final examinations, an intermediate module, an optics and  refraction module, and a dissertation written on a research project carried out under supervision is also assessed.
Moreover, a two and a half years residency programme leads to MCPS while a two-year training of DOMS is also being offered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cpsp.edu.pk |title=College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan |publisher=Cpsp.edu.pk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}</ref> For candidates in the, ilitary, a stringent two-year graded course, with quarterly assessments, is held under Armed Forces Post Graduate Medical Institute in Rawalpindi.
The M.S. in ophthalmology is also one of the specialty programmes. In addition to programmes for doctors, various diplomas and degrees for opticians are also being offered to produce competent optic technicians in this field. These programmes are being offered notably by the Punjab Institute of Preventive Ophthalmology (PIPO) in  Lahore and the Pakistan Institute of Community Ophthalmology in Peshawar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kemu.edu.pk/pipo.html |title=King Edward Medical University |publisher=Kemu.edu.pk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}</ref> Sub-specialty fellowships are also being offered in the fields of [[pediatric ophthalmology]] and vitreo-retinal ophthalmology. [[King Edward Medical University]], Al Shifa trust eye hospital Rawalpindi & Al- Ibrahim eye shospital Karachi has also started a degree program in this field.

===Philippines===
Ophthalmology is a considered a medical specialty that uses medicine and surgery to treat diseases of the eye. To become a general ophthalmologist, a candidate must have completed a Doctor of Medicine degree or its equivalent (e.g. MBBS), have passed the physician licensure exam, completed an internship in medicine, and completed residency at any Philippine Academy of Ophthalmology (PAO)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pao.org.ph/pbo.php |title=PBO Officers &nbsp; &nbsp; |publisher=Pao.org.ph |date=2012-12-01 |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref> accredited program. Attainment of board certification in ophthalmology from PBO is optional, but is preferred and required to gain privileges in most major health institutions. Graduates of residency programs can receive further training in subspecialties of ophthalmology such as neuro-ophthalmology, etc. by completing a fellowship program which varies in length depending on each program's requirements. The leading professional organization in the country is the Philippine Academy of Ophthalmology<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pao.org.ph |title=Pao.org.ph |publisher=Pao.org.ph |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}</ref> which also regulates ophthalmology residency programs and board certification through its accrediting agency, the Philippine Board of Ophthalmology.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], there are three colleges that grant postgraduate degrees in ophthalmology. The Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth) grants MRCOphth and FRCOphth (postgraduate exams), the Royal College of Edinburgh grants MRCSEd, the Royal College of Glasgow grants FRCS. Postgraduate work as a [[specialist registrar]] and one of these degrees is required for specialisation in [[eye disease]]s. Such clinical work is within the NHS.
There are only 2.3 ophthalmologists per 100,000 population in the UK – fewer pro rata than in any other nation in the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uems.net |title=European Union of medical specialists |publisher=Uems.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref>

===Republic of Ireland===
{{See also|Irish College of Ophthalmologists}}
In [[Ireland]], the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland]] grants Membership (MRCSI (Ophth)) and Fellowship (FRCSI (Ophth)) qualifications in conjunction with the [[Irish College of Ophthalmologists]]. Total postgraduate training involves an intern year, a minimum of 3 years of Basic Surgical Training and a further 4.5 years of Higher Surgical Training. Clinical training takes place within public, [[Health Service Executive]]-funded hospitals in [[Dublin]], [[Sligo]], [[Limerick]], [[Galway]], and [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. A minimum of 8.5 years of training is required before eligibility to work in [[Consultant (medicine)|consultant]] posts. Some trainees take extra time to obtain [[MSc]], [[Doctor of Medicine#UK, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries|MD]] or [[PhD]] degrees and to undertake clinical fellowships in the UK, Australia and the United States.

===United States===
{{See also|Medical education in the United States}}
In the [[United States]], four years of [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] training after [[Medical school in the United States|medical school]] are required, with the first year being an [[Internship (medicine)|internship]] in surgery, internal medicine, pediatrics, or a general transition year. Optional [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowships]] in advanced topics may be pursued for several years after residency.  Most currently practicing ophthalmologists train in medical residency programs accredited by the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] (ACGME) or the [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA) and are board-certified by the [[American Board of Ophthalmology]] or the [[American Osteopathic Board of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology]].  United States physicians who train in [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States#Current status|osteopathic medical schools]] hold the [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] ([[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]]) degree rather than an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degree. The same residency and certification requirements for ophthalmology training must be fulfilled by osteopathic physicians.

Physicians must complete the requirements of [[continuing medical education]] in order to maintain licensure and for re-certification. Professional bodies like the [[American Academy of Ophthalmology|AAO]] and [[eye surgery|ASCRS: The American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery]] organizes conferences, helps physician members through [[continuing medical education]] programs for maintaining [[board certification]], and provides political advocacy and peer support.

==Sub-specialities==
Ophthalmology includes sub-specialities which deal either with certain diseases or diseases of certain parts of the eye. Some of them are:
* [[Anterior segment]] surgery
* Retinal ophthalmology, which emphasizes such things as [[laser]] treatment of the retina and actual retinal surgery.
* [[Cataract]]s — not usually considered a subspecialty ''per se'', since most general ophthalmologists perform cataract surgery
* [[Cornea]], ocular surface, and external disease
* [[Glaucoma]]
* [[retina|Medical retina]], deals with treatment of retinal problems through non-surgical means.
* [[Neuro-ophthalmology]]
* [[Ocular oncology]]
* [[Oculoplastics]] & Orbit surgery
* [[Ophthalmic pathology]]
* [[Pediatric ophthalmology]]/[[Strabismus]] (mis-alignment of the eyes)
* [[Refractive surgery]]
* [[Uveitis]]
* [[Immunology]]
* [[Veterinary|Veterinary Formal]] specialty training programs in veterinary ophthalmology now exist in some countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acvo.com/ |title=Acvo.com |publisher=Acvo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecvo.org/ |title=Ecvo.org |publisher=Ecvo.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}</ref>
* [[Eye surgery#Vitreo-retinal surgery|Vitreo-retinal surgery]], deals with surgical management of retinal and posterior segment diseases and disorders. Medical retina and vitreo-retinal surgery sometimes together called [[posterior segment]] subspecialisation.

* [[Theodor Leber]] Discovered Leber's congenital amaurosis, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, Leber's miliary aneurysm, and Leber's Stellate Nueroretinitis.
* Sir [[William Adams (oculist)|William Adams]] (UK) Founder of [[Exeter]]'s West of [[England]] Eye Infirmary.
* [[Carl Ferdinand von Arlt]] (1812–1887), the elder (Austrian) proved that myopia is largely due to an excessive axial length, published influential textbooks on eye disease, and ran annual eye clinics in needy areas long before the concept of volunteer eye camps became popular. His name is still attached to some disease signs, e.g., von Arlt's line in trachoma. His son Ferdinand Ritter von Arlt, the younger, was also an ophthalmologist.
* [[Jacques Daviel]] (France) claimed to be the 'father' of modern [[cataract]] surgery in that he performed extracapsular extraction instead of needling the cataract or pushing it back into the vitreous. It is said that he carried out the technique on 206 patients in 1752–3, out of which 182 were reported to be successful. These figures are not very credible, given the total lack of both anaesthesia and aseptic technique at that time.
* [[Frans Cornelis Donders]] (1818–1889) (Dutch) published pioneering analyses of ocular biomechanics, intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and physiological optics. Made possible the prescribing of combinations of spherical and cylindrical lenses to treat astigmatism.
* [[Joseph Forlenze]] (1757-1833) (Italy), specialist in [[cataract surgery]], became popular during the [[First French Empire]], healing, among many, personalities such as the minister [[Jean-Étienne-Marie Portalis]] and the poet [[Ponce Denis Écouchard Lebrun|Ponce Denis Lebrun]]. He was nominated by [[Napoleon]] "chirurgien oculiste of the lycees, the civil hospices and all the charitable institutions of the departments of the Empire".<ref>[[Jan E. Goldstein|Jan Ellen Goldstein]], ''Console and Classify. The French Psychiatric Profession in the Nineteenth Century'', Chicago Press, 2002, p. 63</ref> He was known also for his free interventions, mainly in favour of poor people.
[[File:Allvar Gullstrand 02.jpg|thumb|160px|Allvar Gullstrand]]
* [[Albrecht von Graefe]] (1828–1870) (Germany) Along with Helmholtz and Donders, one of the 'founding fathers' of ophthalmology as a specialty. A brilliant clinician and charismatic teacher who had an international influence on the development of ophthalmology. A pioneer in mapping visual field defects and diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma. Introduced a cataract extraction technique that remained the standard for over 100 years, and many other important surgical techniques such as iridectomy. Rationalised the use of many ophthalmically important drugs, including mydriatics & miotics. The founder of one of the earliest ophthalmic societies (German Ophthalmological Society, 1857) and one of the earliest ophthalmic journals (Graefe's Archives of Ophthalmology). The most important ophthalmologist of the nineteenth century.
* [[Allvar Gullstrand]] (Sweden), [[Nobel Prize]] winner in 1911 for his research on the eye as a light-refracting apparatus. Described the ''schematic eye'' a mathematical model of the [[human eye]] based on his measurements known as the ''optical constants'' of the eye. His measurements are still used today.
* [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], great German polymath, invented the ophthalmoscope (1851) and published important work on physiological optics, including colour vision (1850s).
* [[Polara family|Socrate Polara]] (1800–1860) (Italy), founded the first dedicated ophthalmology clinic in Sicily in 1829 entirely as a philanthropic endeavor; later appointed as the first director of the ophthalmology department at the Grand Hospital of Palermo, Sicily (Italy) in 1831 after the Sicilian government became convinced of the importance of state support for the specialization.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parisi|first=Antonino|title=Annuario Storico del Regno della Due Sicilie, dal Principio del Governo, di Ferdinando II Borbone|year=1838|publisher=Tipografica Trani (Napoli)|pages=66–67}}</ref>
* [[Hermann Snellen]] (Netherlands) introduced the [[Snellen chart]] to study [[visual acuity]].
* [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] (United Kingdom). English writer, primarily of the Sherlock Holmes stories. Trained in but apparently never practiced Ophthalmology.
* [[Jose Rizal]] (Philippines). The Philippines' national hero was an ophthalmologist. One of his works was an operation of both his mother's eyes for removal of a cataract.
