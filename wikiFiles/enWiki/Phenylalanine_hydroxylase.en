'''Phenylalanine hydroxylase''' (PheOH, alternatively PheH or PAH) ({{EC number|1.14.16.1}}) is an [[enzyme]] that catalyzes the [[hydroxylation]] of the aromatic side-chain of [[phenylalanine]] to generate [[tyrosine]]. PheOH is one of three members of the pterin-dependent amino acid hydroxylases, a class of [[monooxygenase]] that uses [[tetrahydrobiopterin]] (BH<sub>4</sub>, a [[pteridine]] cofactor) and a non-heme iron for catalysis. During the reaction, molecular oxygen is heterolytically cleaved with sequential incorporation of one oxygen atom into BH<sub>4</sub> and phenylalanine substrate.<ref name=Fitzpatrick1999>{{cite journal | author = Fitzpatrick PF | title = Tetrahydropterin-dependent amino acid hydroxylases | journal = Annu.

Phenylalanine hydroxylase is the [[Rate-determining step|rate-limiting]] enzyme of the [[metabolic pathway]] that degrades excess phenylalanine. Research on phenylalanine hydroxylase by Seymour Kaufman led to the discovery of tetrahydrobiopterin as a biological cofactor.<ref name="pmid13525410">{{cite journal | author = KAUFMAN S | title = A new cofactor required for the enzymatic conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine | journal = J.

==Enzyme mechanism==
The reaction is thought to proceed through the following steps: 

# formation of a Fe(II)-O-O-BH<sub>4</sub> bridge.
# heterolytic cleavage of the O-O bond to yield the ferryl oxo hydroxylating intermediate Fe(IV)=O
# attack on Fe(IV)=O to hydroxylate phenylalanine substrate to tyrosine.<ref name="Fitzpatrick_2003">{{cite journal | author = Fitzpatrick PF | title = Mechanism of aromatic amino acid hydroxylation | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 42 | issue = 48 | pages = 14083–91 | year = 2003 | month = December | pmid = 14640675 | pmc = 1635487 | doi = 10.1021/bi035656u }}</ref>

Two pathways have been proposed based on models that differ in the proximity of the iron to the pterin cofactor and the number of water molecules assumed to be iron-coordinated during catalysis. According to one model, an iron dioxygen complex is initially formed and stabilized as a resonance hybrid of Fe<sup>2+</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and Fe<sup>3+</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>. The activated O<sub>2</sub> then attacks BH<sub>4</sub>, forming a transition state characterized by charge separation between the electron-deficient pterin ring and the electron-rich dioxygen species.<ref name="Bassan_2003_diox">{{cite journal | author = Bassan A, Blomberg MR, Siegbahn PE | title = Mechanism of dioxygen cleavage in tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent amino acid hydroxylases | journal = Chemistry | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 106–15 | year = 2003 | month = January | pmid = 12506369 | doi = 10.1002/chem.200390006 }}</ref> The Fe(II)-O-O-BH4 bridge is subsequently formed.

'''Hydroxylation of phenylalanine by ferryl oxo intermediate.''' Because the mechanism involves a Fe(IV)=O (as opposed to a peroxypterin) hydroxylating intermediate, oxidation of the BH<sub>4</sub> cofactor and hydroxylation of phenylalanine can be decoupled, resulting in unproductive consumption of BH4 and formation of H2O2.<ref name="Fitzpatrick_2003"/>  When productive, though, the Fe(IV)=O intermediate is added to phenylalanine in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction that reduces iron from the ferryl to the ferrous state.<ref name="Fitzpatrick_2003"/>  Although initially an arene oxide or radical intermediate was proposed, analyses of the related tryptophan and tyrosine hydroxylases have suggested that the reaction instead proceeds through a cationic intermediate that requires Fe(IV)=O to be coordinated to a water ligand rather than a hydroxo group.<ref name="Fitzpatrick_2003"/><ref name="Bassan_2003_arom">{{cite journal | author = Bassan A, Blomberg MR, Siegbahn PE | title = Mechanism of aromatic hydroxylation by an activated FeIV&amp;#61;O core in tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent hydroxylases | journal = Chemistry | volume = 9 | issue = 17 | pages = 4055–67 | year = 2003 | month = September | pmid = 12953191 | doi = 10.1002/chem.200304768 }}</ref> This cationic intermediate subsequently undergoes a 1,2-hydride NIH shift, yielding a dienone intermediate that then tautomerizes to form the tyrosine product.<ref name="Pavon_2006">{{cite journal | author = Pavon JA, Fitzpatrick PF | title = Insights into the catalytic mechanisms of phenylalanine and tryptophan hydroxylase from kinetic isotope effects on aromatic hydroxylation | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 45 | issue = 36 | pages = 11030–7 | year = 2006 | month = September | pmid = 16953590 | pmc = 1945167 | doi = 10.1021/bi0607554 }}</ref> The pterin cofactor is regenerated by hydration of the carbinolamine product of PheOH to quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (qBH<sub>2</sub>), which is then reduced to BH<sub>4</sub>.<ref name="Flatmark_1999">{{cite journal | author = Flatmark T, Stevens RC | title = Structural Insight into the Aromatic Amino Acid Hydroxylases and Their Disease-Related Mutant Forms | journal = Chem.

== Structure ==
The PheOH monomer (51.9 kDa) consists of three distinct domains: a regulatory N-terminal domain (residues 1-117), the catalytic domain (residues 118-427), and a C-terminal domain (residues 428-453) responsible for oligomerization of identical monomers. Extensive crystallographic analysis has been performed, especially on the pterin- and iron-coordinated catalytic domain to examine the active site. The structure of the N-terminal regulatory domain has also been determined, and together with the solved structure of the homologous tyrosine hydroxylase C-terminal tetramerization domain, a structural model of tetrameric PheOH has been proposed.<ref name="Flatmark_1999"/>

=== Catalytic domain ===
Solved crystal structures of the catalytic domain indicate that the active site consists of an open and spacious pocket lined primarily by hydrophobic residues, though three glutamic acid residues, two histidines, and a tyrosine are also present and critical for pterin- and iron-binding.<ref name="Flatmark_1999"/> Contradictory evidence exists about the coordination state of the ferrous atom and its proximity to BH4 within the active site.

Prokaryotic PheOH is monomeric, whereas eukaryotic PheOH exists in an equilibrium between homotetrameric and homodimeric forms.<ref name="Fitzpatrick_2003"/><ref name="Flatmark_1999"/> The dimerization interface is composed of symmetry-related loops that link identical monomers, while the overlapping C-terminal tetramerization domain mediates the association of conformationally distinct dimers that are characterized by a different relative orientation of the catalytic and tetramerization domains (Flatmark, Erlandsen). The resulting distortion of the tetramer symmetry is evident in the differential surface area of the dimerization interfaces and distinguishes PheOH from the tetramerically symmetrical tyrosine hydroxylase.<ref name="Flatmark_1999"/> A domain-swapping mechanism has been proposed to mediate formation of the tetramer from dimers, in which C-terminal alpha-helixes mutually alter their conformation around a flexible C-terminal five-residue hinge region to form a coiled-coil structure, shifting equilibrium toward the tetrameric form.<ref name="Fitzpatrick_2003"/><ref name="Flatmark_1999"/><ref name="Bjørgo_2001">{{cite journal | author = Bjørgo E, de Carvalho RM, Flatmark T | title = A comparison of kinetic and regulatory properties of the tetrameric and dimeric forms of wild-type and Thr427-->Pro mutant human phenylalanine hydroxylase: contribution of the flexible hinge region Asp425-Gln429 to the tetramerization and cooperative substrate binding | journal = Eur.

== Disease relevance ==
Deficiency in PheOH activity due to mutations in the PAH gene causes [[hyperphenylalaninemia]] (HPA), and when blood phenylalanine levels increase above 20 times the normal concentration, the metabolic disease [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU) results.<ref name="Kaufman_1999"/> PKU is both genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous: Over 300 distinct pathological mutants have been identified, the majority of which correspond to missense mutations that map to the catalytic domain.<ref name="Flatmark_1999"/><ref name="Erlandsen_1997"/> When a cohort of identified PheOH mutants were expressed in recombinant systems, the enzymes displayed altered kinetic behavior and/or reduced stability, consistent with structural mapping of these mutations to both the catalytic and tetramerization domains of the enzyme.<ref name="Flatmark_1999"/> Interestingly, BH4<sub>4</sub> has been administered as a pharmacological treatment and has been shown to reduce blood levels of phenylalanine for a segment of PKU patients whose genotypes lead to some residual PAH activity but have no defect in BH4<sub>4</sub> synthesis or regeneration. Follow-up studies suggest that in the case of certain PheOH mutants, excess BH4<sub>4</sub> acts as a [[pharmacological chaperone]] to stabilize mutant enzymes with disrupted tetramer assembly and increased sensitivity to proteolytic cleavage and aggregation.<ref name="Muntau_2010">{{cite journal | author = Muntau AC, Gersting SW | title = Phenylketonuria as a model for protein misfolding diseases and for the development of next generation orphan drugs for patients with inborn errors of metabolism | journal = J.

Since phenylketonurea can cause irreversible damage, it is imperative that deficiencies in the Phenylalanine Hydroxylase are determined early on in development. One method is a post-parturition screening test known as the [[Guthrie test|Guthrie Test]]. The common method is via drawing blood from a small needle prick at the heel of the newborn and testing it for phenylketonurea, indicative of a PH deficiency. Placing the individual on a low phenylalanine, high tyrosine diet can help prevent any long-term damage to their development.

== Related enzymes ==
Phenylalanine hydroxylase is closely related to two other enzymes:
* [[tryptophan hydroxylase]] (EC number 1.14.16.4), which controls levels of [[serotonin]] in the brain and the [[gastrointestinal tract]]
* [[tyrosine hydroxylase]] (EC number 1.14.16.2), which controls levels of [[dopamine]], [[epinephrine]], and [[norepinephrine]] in the brain and the adrenal medulla.

The three enzymes are homologous, that is, are thought to have evolved from the same ancient hydroxylase.
