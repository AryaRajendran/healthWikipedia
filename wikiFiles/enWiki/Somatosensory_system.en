The '''somatosensory system''' is a diverse [[sensory system]] comprising the receptors and processing centres to produce the [[sensory modality|sensory modalities]] such as touch, [[temperature]], [[proprioception]] (body position), and [[nociception]] (pain). The [[sensory receptors]] cover the [[skin]] and [[epithelia]], [[skeletal muscle]]s, [[bone]]s and [[joint]]s, internal [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s, and the [[cardiovascular system]].

While '''touch'''<ref>Also called '''tactile perception''', '''tactual perception''', '''tactition''', or '''haptic perception'''. The [[adjectival form]]s are "tactile", "somatosensory", "tactual", and "haptic".</ref> is considered one of the five traditional [[sense]]s, the impression of touch is formed from several modalities. In medicine, the colloquial term "touch" is usually replaced with "'''somatic senses'''" to better reflect the variety of mechanisms involved.

Somatic senses are sometimes referred to as '''somesthetic senses''', with the understanding that somesthesis includes touch, proprioception and (depending on usage) also haptic perception.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Robles-De-La-Torre G |title=The Importance of the Sense of Touch in Virtual and Real Environments |journal=IEEE Multimedia |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=24–30 |year=2006 |doi=10.1109/MMUL.2006.69 |url=http://www.roblesdelatorre.com/gabriel/GR-IEEE-MM-2006.pdf}}</ref>

The system reacts to diverse [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] using different receptors: [[thermoreceptors]], [[nociceptors]], [[mechanoreceptors]] and [[chemoreceptors]]. Transmission of information from the receptors passes via [[sensory nerve]]s through tracts in the [[spinal cord]] and into the brain. Processing primarily occurs in the [[postcentral gyrus|primary somatosensory area]] in the [[parietal lobe]] of the [[cerebral cortex]].
[[File:Sensory Homunculus.png|thumb|right|The [[cortical homunculus]] was devised by [[Wilder Penfield]]. ]]
At its simplest, the system works when activity in a sensory [[neuron]] is [[sensory transduction|triggered]] by a specific stimulus such as heat; this signal eventually passes to an area in the brain uniquely attributed to that area on the body—this allows the processed stimulus to be felt at the correct location. The point-to-point mapping of the body surfaces in the brain is called a [[homunculus]] and is essential in the creation of a [[body image]].  This brain-surface ("cortical") map is not immutable, however.  Dramatic shifts can occur in response to stroke or injury.

== Anatomy ==
The somatosensory system is spread through all major parts of a [[mammal]]'s body (and other [[vertebrates]]).  It consists both of [[sensory receptors]] and sensory ([[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]]) [[neurons]] in the periphery (skin, muscle and organs for example), to deeper neurones within the [[central nervous system]].

===General somatosensory pathway===

A somatosensory pathway  will typically have three long neurons:<ref>Saladin KS. Anatomy and Physiology 3rd edd. 2004. McGraw-Hill, New York.</ref> primary, secondary and tertiary (or first, second, and third). 
* The ''first'' neuron always has its [[cell body]] in the [[dorsal root ganglion]] of the [[spinal nerve]] (if sensation is in head or neck, it will be the [[Trigeminal ganglion|trigeminal nerve ganglia]] or the ganglia of other sensory [[cranial nerves]]). 
* The ''second'' neuron has its [[cell body]] either in the spinal cord or in the brainstem.  This neuron's ascending [[axons]] will cross ([[decussate]]) to the opposite side either in the [[spinal cord]] or in the [[brainstem]].  The [[axons]] of many of these [[neurones]] terminate in the [[thalamus]] (for example the [[ventral posterior nucleus]], VPN), others terminate in the [[Reticular activating system|reticular system]] or the [[cerebellum]]. 
* In the case of touch and certain types of pain, the ''third'' neuron has its [[cell body]] in the VPN of the thalamus and ends in the [[postcentral gyrus]] of the [[parietal lobe]].

===Periphery===
In the periphery, the somatosensory system detects various stimuli by [[sensory receptors]], e.g. by [[mechanoreceptors]] for tactile sensation and [[nociceptors]] for [[pain sensation]].  The sensory information (touch, pain, temperature etc.,) is then conveyed to the [[central nervous system]] by afferent [[neurones]].  There are a number of different types of afferent [[neurones]] which vary in their size, structure and properties.  Generally there is a correlation between the type of [[sensory modality]] detected and the type of afferent neurone involved. For example, slow, thin, unmyelinated [[neurones]] conduct pain whereas faster, thicker, [[myelinated]] [[neurones]] conduct casual touch.

The [[receptive field]] of a particular afferent  neuron is given by the sensory receptors supplying it, and in turn from a particular region of the skin.

===Spinal cord===
In the spinal cord, the somatosensory system <ref>Nolte J.The Human Brain 5th ed. 2002. Mosby Inc, Missouri.</ref> includes ascending pathways from the body to the [[brain]].  One major target within the [[brain]] is the [[postcentral gyrus]] in the [[cerebral cortex]].  This is the target for neurons of the [[Dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway|Dorsal Column Medial Lemniscal]] pathway and the [[Ventral spinothalamic tract|Ventral Spinothalamic pathway]].  Note that many ascending somatosensory pathways include synapses in either the thalamus or the reticular formation before they reach the cortex. Other ascending pathways, particularly those involved with control of [[Human position|posture]] are projected to the [[cerebellum]].  These include the [[Ventral spinocerebellar tract|ventral]] and [[dorsal spinocerebellar tract]]s.  Another important target for afferent [[somatosensory]] [[neurons]] which enter the [[spinal cord]] are those neurons involved with local segmental [[reflexes]].

===Brain===
The primary somatosensory area in the human cortex (also called '''primary somatic sensory cortex''' or '''SI''') is located in the [[postcentral gyrus]] of the [[parietal lobe]] and makes up four distinct fields or regions known as [[Brodmann area]] '''3a,''' '''3b,''' '''1,''' and '''2'''.<ref name="PurvesDale">{{cite book|last=Purves|first=Dale|title=Neuroscience, Fifth Edition|year=2012|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc.|location=Sunderland, MA|isbn=978-0-87893-695-3|pages=202–203}}</ref>  The postcentral gyrus is the location of the ''primary somatosensory area'', the main sensory receptive area for the sense of touch. Any individual neuron has its [[receptive field]] on the skin.

A relationship between the somatosensory cortical areas and their projection of the body was discovered by recording electrical activity in the human cortex after mechanosensory stimulation of different body parts during neurosurgical procedures. These data led to the construction of ''somatotopic maps''<ref name="PurvesDale" /> in which a [[Somatotopic arrangement]] was generated. Like other sensory areas, there is a map of sensory space called a [[homunculus]] at this location. For the primary somatosensory cortex, this is called the [[sensory homunculus]]. Areas of this part of the [[human brain]] map to certain areas of the body, dependent on the amount or importance of somatosensory input from that area. For example, there is a large area of cortex devoted to sensation in the hands, while the [[Human back]] has a much smaller area. Somatosensory information involved with [[proprioception]] and posture also targets an entirely different part of the brain, the [[cerebellum]].

==Fine touch and Crude touch==
Fine touch, (or discriminative touch), is a sensory modality which allows a subject to sense and localise touch. The form of [[touch]] where localisation is not possible is known as [[crude touch]]. The [[posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway]] is the pathway responsible for the sending of fine touch information to the [[cerebral cortex]] of the brain.

Crude touch (or non-discriminative touch) is a sensory modality which allows the subject to sense that something has touched them, without being able to localize where they were touched (contrasting "fine touch"). Its fibres are carried in the [[spinothalamic tract]]. Unlike the fine touch which is carried in the dorsal column 

As fine touch normally works in parallel to crude touch, a person will be able to localize touch until fibres carrying fine touch ([[Posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway]]) have been disrupted. Then the subject will feel the touch, but be unable to identify where they were touched.

==Physiology==
[[File:Tickle.jpg|thumb|Touch can result in many different physiological reactions. Here, a baby laughs at being [[tickling|tickled]] by an older sister.]]
Initiation of somatosensation begins with activation of a physical "receptor". These somatosensory receptors tend to lie in organs, most notably in the skin, or muscle. The structure of these receptors is broadly similar in all cases, consisting of either a "[[free nerve ending]]" or a nerve ending embedded in a specialised capsule. They can be activated by movement ([[mechanoreceptor]]), pressure ([[mechanoreceptor]]), chemical ([[chemoreceptor]]) and/or temperature. Another activation is by [[vibration]]s generated as a finger scans across a surface. This is the means by which we can sense fine textures in which the spatial scale is less than 200&nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]]. Such vibrations are around 250&nbsp;Hz, which is the optimal frequency sensitivity of [[Pacinian corpuscle]]s.<ref>Scheibert J, Leurent S, Prevost A, Debrégeas G. (2009). The role of fingerprints in the coding of tactile information probed with a biomimetic sensor. Science. 323(5920):1503-6. PMID 19179493 {{DOI|10.1126/science.1166467 }}</ref> In each case, the general principle of activation is similar; the stimulus causes [[depolarisation]] of the nerve ending and then an [[action potential]] is initiated. This [[action potential]] then (usually) travels inward towards the [[spinal cord]].

==Diseases and disorders==
A somatosensory deficiency may be caused by a [[peripheral neuropathy]] involving peripheral nerves of the somatosensory system.

This may present as [[numbness]] or [[paresthesia]].

Certain types of seizures are associated with the somatosensory system. Cortical injury may lead to loss of thermal sensation or the ability to discriminate pain. An [[Aura (symptom)]] involving thermal and painful sensations is a pheomenon known to precede the onset of an [[Epileptic seizure]] or focal seizures. Another type of seizure, called a sensory [[Jacksonian seizure]] involves an abnormal, localizable, cutaneous sensation but does not have apparent stimulus. This sensation may progress along a limb or to adjacent cutaneous body areas, reflecting abnormal neuronal firing in the postcentral gyrus where an epileptic discharge is propagated. These episodes in which patients are consciously aware during a seizure have been useful for identifying problems associated with the somatosensory cortex. Patients can describe the nature of the seizure and how they feel during it.<ref name="Human Neuroanatomy">{{cite book|last=Augustine|first=James R.|title=Human Neuroanatomy|year=2008|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=978-0-12-068251-5|pages=360}}</ref> 

The absence of proprioception or two point tactile discrimination on one side of the body suggests injury to the contralateral side of the primary somatosensory cortex. However, depending on the extent of the injury, damage can range in loss of proprioception of an individual limb or the entire body. A deficit known as '''cortical''' [[Astereognosis]] '''of the receptive type''' describes an inability to utilize tactile sensory information for identifying objects placed in the hand. For example, if this type of injury effects the hand region in the primary somatosensory cortex for one cerebral hemisphere, a patient with closed eyes cannot perceive the position of the fingers on the contralateral hand and will not be able to identify objects such as keys or a cell phone if they are placed into that hand.<ref name="Human Neuroanatomy" />   

Evaluation of any suspected disease of the somatosensory system is included in a [[Neurological_examination#Peripheral_nervous_system|neurological examination of the peripheral nervous system]]

==Technology==
	
The new research area of [[haptic technology]] can provide touch sensation in virtual and real environments. This new discipline has started to provide critical insights into touch capabilities. In the field of [[speech therapy]], tactile feedback has begun to be used to treat speech disorders.
