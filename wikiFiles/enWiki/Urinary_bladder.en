The '''urinary bladder''' is the organ that collects [[urine]] excreted by the [[kidney]]s before disposal by [[urination]].  A hollow<ref>Howard A. Werman, Keith J. Karren.</ref> [[muscle|muscular]], and distensible (or elastic) organ, the bladder sits on the [[pelvic floor]]. Urine enters the bladder via the [[ureter]]s and exits via the [[urethra]].

Bladders occur throughout much of the [[Animal|animal kingdom]], but are very diverse in form{{further explanation needed|date=February 2013}} and in some cases are not [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] with the urinary bladder in humans.

The human urinary bladder is derived in embryo from the [[urogenital sinus]] and, it is initially continuous with the [[allantois]].  In males, the base of the bladder lies between the rectum and the pubic symphysis. It is superior to the [[prostate]], and separated from the [[rectum]] by the [[rectovesical excavation]].  In females, the bladder sits inferior to the uterus and anterior to the vagina; thus, its maximum capacity is lower than in males. It is separated from the [[uterus]] by the [[vesicouterine excavation]]. In [[infants]] and young children, the urinary bladder is in the [[abdomen]] even when empty.<ref>{{cite book |author=Moore, Keith L.; Dalley, Arthur F |title=[[Clinically Oriented Anatomy]] |edition=5th |year=2006 |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins }}</ref>

==Detrusor muscle==

The [[detrusor muscle]] is a layer of the urinary bladder wall made of [[smooth muscle]] [[muscle fibers|fibers]] arranged in spiral, longitudinal, and circular [[Fiber bundle|bundles]]. When the bladder is stretched, this signals the [[parasympathetic]] nervous system to contract the [[detrusor muscle]]. This encourages the bladder to expel urine through the urethra.

For the urine to exit the bladder, both the [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]]ally controlled internal [[sphincter]] and the [[somatic|voluntarily]] controlled external sphincter must be opened. Problems with these muscles can lead to [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]]. 

The urinary bladder usually holds 300-350 ml of urine. As urine accumulates, the [[rugae]] flatten and the wall of the bladder thins as it stretches, allowing the bladder to store larger amounts of urine without a significant rise in internal pressure.<ref>{{cite book |author=Marieb, Mallatt |title=Human Anatomy |edition=5th |publisher=Pearson International |chapter=23 |page=700}}</ref>

Since the urinary bladder has a [[transitional epithelium]], it does not produce mucus.<ref>{{cite journal  |author=Chin T, Liu , Tsai H, Wei C |title=Vaginal reconstruction using urinary bladder flap in a patient with cloacal malformation |journal=Journal of Pediatric Surgery |volume=42 |issue=9 |date=September 2007  |pmid=17848259 |pages=1612–5 |doi=10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2007.04.040 }}</ref>

==Fundus== <!--Fundus of the bladder redirects here-->
[[File:Bladder.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Bladder]]

The fundus of the bladder is the base of the bladder, formed by the posterior wall. It is [[lymphatic]]ally drained by the [[external iliac lymph nodes]]. The [[peritoneum]] lies superior to the fundus.

==Urination frequency==
Males with an [[enlarged prostate]] urinate more frequently. One definition of [[overactive bladder]] is when a person urinates more than eight times per day, though there can be other causes of urination frequency. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Innervation==
The bladder receives motor innervation from both sympathetic fibers, most of which arise from the hypogastric plexuses and nerves, and parasympathetic fibers, which come from the pelvic splanchnic nerves and the inferior hypogastric plexus.<ref name="Moore227">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Keith|title=Essential Clinical Anatomy, Third Edition|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=0-7817-6274-X|pages=227–228|coauthors=Anne Agur}}</ref>

Sensation from the bladder is transmitted to the central nervous system (CNS) via [[general visceral afferent fibers]] (GVA).  GVA fibers on the superior surface follow the course of the sympathetic efferent nerves back to the CNS, while GVA fibers on the inferior portion of the bladder follow the course of the parasympathetic efferents.<ref name="Moore227"/>

==Disorders==
{{main|Urinary bladder disease}}
[[File:Bladderdiverticulum.png|thumb|A [[diverticulum]] of the bladder]]
Disorders of or related to the bladder include:
* [[Bladder cancer]]
* [[Bladder exstrophy]]
* [[Bladder infection]]
* [[Bladder spasm]]
* [[Bladder sphincter dyssynergia]], a condition in which the sufferer cannot coordinate relaxation of the urethra sphincter with the contraction of the bladder muscles
* [[Bladder stone]]s
* [[Cystitis]]
* [[Hematuria]], or presence of blood in the urine, is a reason to seek medical attention without delay, as it is a symptom of bladder cancer as well as bladder and [[kidney stone]]s
* [[Interstitial Cystitis]]
* [[Overactive bladder]], a condition that affects a large number of people
* [[Urinary incontinence]]
* [[Urinary retention]]
