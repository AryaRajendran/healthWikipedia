'''Blood squirt''' ('''blood spurt''', '''blood spray''', '''blood gush''', or '''blood jet''') is the effect when an [[artery]], a blood vessel in the [[human body]] (or other organism's body), is [[cutting|cut]]. [[Blood pressure]] causes the blood to [[bleeding|bleed]] out at a rapid, intermittent rate, in a [[wikt:spray|spray]], [[wikt:squirt|squirt]], [[wikt:gush|gush]] or [[jet (fluid)|jet]], coinciding with the beating of the heart, rather than the slower, but steady flow of [[vein|venous]] bleeding. Also known as '''arterial bleeding''', '''arterial spurting''', or '''arterial gushing''', the amount of blood loss can be copious, occur very rapidly,<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.brooksidepress.org/Products/OperationalMedicine/DATA/operationalmed/Manuals/Standard1stAid/chapter3.html|title=U.S. Navy Standard First Aid Manual, Chapter 3 (online)|accessdate=3 Feb 2003}}</ref> and can [[exsanguination|lead to death]].

==Anatomy==
In cut [[carotid arteries]] with 100 mL of blood through the heart at each beat (at 65 beats a minute), a completely severed artery will spurt blood for about 30 seconds and the blood will not spurt much higher than the human head. If the artery is just nicked, on the other hand, the blood will spurt longer but will be coming out under pressure and spraying much further.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2004/jul/22/research.science1 "How writers fill in all the gory details"], Humphrey Evans, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 22 July 2004, retrieved 17 March 2010</ref>

To prevent [[hand]] [[ischemia]], there is a "squirt test" that involves squirting blood from the [[radial artery]], which is used in [[intraoperative]] assessment of collateral arm blood flow before radial artery [[Organ harvesting|harvest]].<ref>[http://ats.ctsnetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/74/1/271 Intraoperative confirmation of ulnar collateral blood flow during radial artery harvesting using the "squirt test"], Inderpaul Birdi and Andrew J. Ritchie of [[Papworth Hospital]], ''[[The Annals of Thoracic Surgery]]'' at [[CTSNet]], 2002</ref>

In 1933, a [[murder]] [[trial (law)|trial]] prompted a testimony from Dr. Clement Harrisse Arnold about how far blood could spurt from the neck: six inches vertically and 18 inches laterally.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,748742,00.html "Medicine: Blood Spurt"], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', 8 April 1935, retrieved 17 March 2010</ref>

==Iconography==
[[Chhinnamasta]], a self-decapitated Hindu goddess, is [[iconography|depicted]] holding her head with three '''jets of blood''' spurting out of her bleeding neck, which are drunk by her severed head and two attendants. [[Saint Miliau]], a Christian martyr killed c. 6th century AD, is sometimes represented holding his severed head, as in the retable of the Passion of the Christ at [[Lampaul-Guimiliau]], where blood gushes from his neck.

==Insects and animals==
Some animals deliberately [[Autohaemorrhaging|autohaemorrhage]] or spurt/squirt blood as a [[antipredator adaptation|defense mechanism]]. [[Armored cricket]]s, which are native to Namibia, South Africa, and Botswana, have a unique way of driving away predators: they spew [[vomit]] and spurt [[hemolymph]] (the mollusk and arthropod version of blood) from under their legs and through slits in their exoskeleton. [[Katydid]]s do it too; in fact, in Germany the species has acquired the nickname "blutspritzer", or "blood squirter". The [[horned lizard|regal horned lizard]], too, uses the blood-spewing tactic, shooting the substance from a pocket near its eyes.<ref>[http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/discoblog/2009/07/28/see-it-to-believe-it-animals-vomit-and-spurt-blood-to-thwart-predators/ "See It to Believe It: Animals Vomit, Spurt Blood to Thwart Predators"], Allison Bond, ''[[Discover Magazine]]'' blog, 28 July 2009, retrieved 17 March 2010</ref>

One of the [[oriental rat flea]] mouth's two functions is to squirt partly [[digested]] blood into a bite.

==Popular culture==
Squirting blood is used as a [[special effect|special]]/[[visual effect]] in [[theater]],<ref>[http://www.theatrebayarea.org/mag/article.jsp?id=191 USING STAGE BLOOD], Russell Blackwood, [[Theatre Bay Area]], retrieved 6 April 2010</ref> film (mostly [[horror film|horror]] – particularly [[slasher film|slasher]] – and [[action film|action]]), [[television series]] (mostly [[Horror television series|horror]] and [[drama]]), [[cartoons]], [[anime]], [[comic book]]s, and [[video game]]s.

Cormac McCarthy's 1985 novel ''[[Blood Meridian, Or the Evening Redness in the West]]'' includes a scene in which one of the two Jacksons decapitates the other by a campfire, leading to a graphically described blood spurt.

The 2003 film ''[[Kill Bill]]'' has multiple scenes where [[katana]] is used in combat, often resulting in exaggerated squirting of blood.

The 1991 film ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country#Effects|Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' has a scene where a Klingon gets shot (phasered) in [[zero gravity]]. The blood that spurts out of the Klingon's wounds was created using [[computer generated imagery]] (CGI); the animators had to make sure that the blood floated in a convincing manner while still looking interesting and not too gory. The effects artist looked at [[NASA]] footage of floating water globules to match the physics of the blood particles.<ref>[[Mark A. Altman|Altman, Mark]] (April 1992). "Star Trek VI: the making of 'The Undiscovered Country'". ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' 22 (5): 24–55.</ref>

Video games can use a [[particle system]] to create blood squirt/splat/pool effects.<ref>[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3157/building_an_advanced_particle_.php Building an Advanced Particle System], John Van Der Burg, [[Gamasutra]], 23 June 2000, retrieved 6 April 2010</ref> The blood-gushing special effects in ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' (1992) engendered controversy which only served to boost its popularity.<ref>{{cite web |first= Lewis |last= Beale |authorlink=Lewis Beale |title= 'KOMBAT' GEARS DOWN THE MARTIAL-ARTS JUGGERNAUT PULLS ITS PUNCHES TO BRING A LASER LOLLAPALOOZA TO RADIO CITY |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1995/09/14/1995-09-14__kombat__gears_down__the_mar.html |date= 1995-09-14 |publisher= ''[[Daily News (New York)]]'' |accessdate= 2009-11-19}}</ref>

The 2010 television series ''[[Spartacus: Blood and Sand]]'' has "[[geyser]]s of blood [that] gush from the bodies of the newly dead" and "every blood spurt is filmed in [[slow motion]] and [[stop-action]]".<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2010/01/22/2010-01-22_starz_spartacus_blood_and_sand_starring_andy_whitfield_is_orgy_of_sex_violence_a.html Starz' 'Spartacus: Blood and Sand,' starring Andy Whitfield, is orgy of sex, violence and swearing], David Hinckley, ''[[New York Daily News]]'', 22 Jan 2010, retrieved 23 March 2010</ref>

The television series ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'' is centered around the life of a blood-spatter analysis specialist Dexter Morgan working in the Miami Police Department (who is also a serial killer).
