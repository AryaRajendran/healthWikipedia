The '''March of Dimes Foundation''' is a United States [[nonprofit organization]] that works to improve the health of mothers and babies.<ref name="March of Dimes Foundation">{{cite web|title=One day...all babies will be born healthy: Annual report 2009|url=http://www.marchofdimes.com/downloads/2009AnnualReport.pdf|publisher=March of Dimes Foundation|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}</ref>  It was founded by then-President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1938 to combat [[polio]]. It has since taken up promoting general health for pregnant women and babies.

==Organization==
The '''March of Dimes''' is a not-for-profit organization with 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. The mission of the March of Dimes is to improve the health of babies by preventing birth defects, premature birth and infant mortality.<ref>{{cite web|title=March of Dimes Website|url=http://www.marchofdimes.com/Mission/mission.html|accessdate=November 5, 2010}}</ref> The foundation is headquartered in [[White Plains, NY]] and has 51 chapters across the U.S., including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The March of Dimes provides mothers, pregnant women and women of childbearing age with educational resources on baby health, pregnancy, preconception and new motherhood, as well as supplying information and support to families affected by prematurity, birth defects, or other infant health problems.<ref>{{cite web|title=Baby Talk: March of Dimes Rebrands|url=http://www.adweek.com/aw/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003696985|publisher=Adweek|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}</ref>

===Name===

The organization began as the '''National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis'''. The name "March of Dimes"—coined in the late 1930s by vaudeville star [[Eddie Cantor]] as a play on the contemporary newsreel series "[[The March of Time]]"—was originally used for the foundation's annual fundraising event that requested each child donate a dime.  At the Christmas season, booths were set up in cities where the children could drop their dime in a slot.  These were out on the street and sometimes not even overseen by anyone.  Gradually the name became synonymous with that of the organization.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[William H. Helfand]]|title='...So that others may walk': So be good. The March of Dimes.|year=2001|publisher=American Journal of Public Health|pages=1190}}</ref>   It was officially adopted as the organization’s name in 1976, when it became known as the '''March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation'''. In 2007, the name became the '''March of Dimes Foundation'''.<ref name="Baghdady Spring 2008 60–65"/>

==History==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:March of dimes.jpg|right|thumb|250px|March of Dimes poster ca. late 1950s]] -->

===Anti-polio efforts===
The group was founded by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on January 3, 1938, as a response to U.S. epidemics of [[polio]], a condition that can leave people with permanent physical disabilities. Roosevelt was himself diagnosed with polio in 1921, and it left him unable to move his legs. The foundation was an alliance between scientists and volunteers, with volunteers raising money to support research and education efforts.<ref name="Baghdady Spring 2008 60–65">{{cite journal|last=Baghdady|first=Maddock J.|title=Marching to a Different Mission|journal=Stanford Social Innovation Review|year=Spring 2008|pages=60–65|url=http://www.ssireview.org/images/articles/2008SP_casestudy_baghdady_maddock.pdf|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}</ref> [[Basil O'Connor]], an attorney and close associate of Roosevelt, helped establish the foundation. He became its president in 1938, a position he held for more than three decades. His first task was to create a network of local chapters that could raise money and deliver aid; more than 3,100 county chapters were established during his tenure.<ref name="Baghdady Spring 2008 60–65"/> From 1938 through the approval of the [[Jonas Salk|Salk]] [[Polio vaccine|vaccine]] in 1955, the foundation spent $233 million on polio patient care, which led to more than 80 percent of U.S. polio patients' receiving significant{{clarify|date=October 2011}} foundation aid.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oshinsky|first=David|title=Polio: an American Story|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-515294-8|pages=65}}</ref>{{verify source|date=October 2011}}

===Change of mission===

With its original goal of eliminating polio accomplished, the March of Dimes faced a choice: to either disband or dedicate its resources to a new mission. Basil O’Connor, president of the March of Dimes at the time, directed his staff to identify strengths and weaknesses of the organization and reformulate its mission.<ref name="Baghdady Spring 2008 60–65"/> In 1958, the NFIP shortened its name to the National Foundation (NF) and launched its "Expanded Program" against birth defects, arthritis, and virus diseases, seeking to become a "flexible force" in the field of public health. In the mid-1960s, the organization focused its efforts on the prevention of birth defects and infant mortality, which became its mission thereafter.<ref>Katz, Michael. "A Genetic Pioneer Focused On Child Health Challenges." ''Nature Neuroscience'' 9.10 (Oct. 2006): ''PsycINFO.'' Web. 21 Dec. 2011.</ref><ref>Bustos, Joseph. "Volunteers march on." ''The Daily Gazette'' (Sterling, IL) 07 Apr. 2008: ''Newspaper Source Plus.'' Web. 21 Dec. 2011.</ref> At this time, the cause of birth defects was unknown; only the effects were visible. In 1976, the organization changed its name to the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation.<ref name="Baghdady Spring 2008 60–65"/> In 2005, reducing the toll of premature birth was added as a mission objective.

==Initiatives after polio==
===Rubella===
[[Rubella]], also called German measles, is associated with a disorder called congenital rubella syndrome, which can cause [[miscarriages]] and birth defects such as [[deafness]], [[blindness]] and [[mental retardation]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Siegel M, Fuerst HT, Guinee VF|title=Rubella epidemicity and embryopath.

====Prematurity campaign====

Awareness about [[preterm birth]], which is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes, is an organizational goal. According to an editorial in the May 2004 issue of the ''Journal of the [[National Medical Association]]'', the original goals of the campaign were to raise awareness of the problem from 35 percent to at least 60 percent and to decrease the rate of premature births by at least 15 percent (from 11.9 percent to 10.1 percent).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Allen & Green|title=March of Dimes Prematurity Campaign: A Call to Action|journal=J Natl Med Assoc.|year=2004|volume=96|pages=686–688|pmc=2640653|pmid=15160986}}</ref> In 2008, the Prematurity Campaign was extended by the Board of Trustees until 2020, and global targets were set for prematurity prevention.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Prematurity Campaign Report and Future Recommendations|journal=March of Dimes Foundation|year=2008}}</ref> In 2008, the March of Dimes started its annual Premature Birth Report Card, which grades the nation and each individual state on preterm birth rates.<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. Gets a 'D' for Preterm Birth Rates|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/womens-health/articles/2008/11/12/us-gets-a-d-for-preterm-birth-rates.html|accessdate=November 5, 2010|newspaper=U.S. News & World Report|date=November 12, 2008}}</ref>

===Newborn screening===
March of Dimes states on its website that it supports mandated newborn screening of all babies in all states in the U.S. for at least 30 life-threatening conditions for which effective treatment and reliable testing is available to prevent catastrophic consequences to the child.<ref>{{cite web|title=March of Dimes Website|url=http://www.marchofdimes.com/professionals/24279_15455.asp|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bern|first=S|title=Expanding newborn screening: From advocacy to program implementation|url=http://apha.confex.com/apha/133am/techprogram/paper_104900.htm|work=American Public Health Association website|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}</ref> 
    
In 2003, the March of Dimes began releasing an annual, state-by-state report card on each state’s adoption of expanded newborn screening recommended by the [[American College of Medical Genetics]]. March of Dimes president [[Jennifer L. Howse]], Ph.D. has stated that this program is intended to inform parents of the tests available in their state, enabling those with affected babies to pursue early treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The March of Dimes Release Annual Report Card on Newborn Screening Program: A Newsmaker Interview with Jennifer Howse, PhD|journal=Medscape Medical News|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/508876|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}</ref>

According to a presentation a    t the 2005 annual meeting of the American Public Health Association, individual, state-based March of Dimes chapters work with governors, state legislators, health departments, health professionals, and parents to improve state newborn screening programs and to make comprehensive newborn screening programs available to every newborn throughout the country.<ref>{{cite web|last=Berns|first=S|title=Expanding newborn screening: From advocacy to program implementation|url=http://apha.confex.com/apha/133am/techprogram/paper_104900.htm|work=American Public Health Association|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}</ref>

In 2005, only 38 percent of infants were born in states that required screening for 21 or more of 29 core conditions recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics; but by 2009, all 50 states and the [[District of Columbia]] required screening for 21 or more of these treatable disorders.<ref>{{cite web|title=Science Daily|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090218080936.htm|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}</ref>

===SCHIP reauthorization===
The March of Dimes has lobbied the United States' Congress to support the continuation of the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP) in 2007 and 2009.

===White paper on prematurity===
In 2009, the March of Dimes partnered with the Department of Reproductive Health and Research of the [[World Health Organization]] (RHR/WHO) to publish a white paper on the global and regional toll of preterm birth worldwide. This report, which was the first attempt to identify the global scope of premature births and related infant deaths, found that an estimated 13 million infants worldwide are born premature each year and more than one million of them die in their first month of life.  Further, premature births account for 9.6 percent of total births and for 28 percent of newborn deaths.  The highest rates of premature birth are in [[Africa]], followed by [[North America]] ([[Canada]] and the [[United States]] combined).<ref>{{cite news|title=1 Million "Preemie" Babies Die Each Year|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/womens-health/articles/2009/10/04/1-million-preemie-babies-die-each-year-report.html|accessdate=November 7, 2010|newspaper=U.S. News & World Report|date=October 4, 2009}}</ref>

Animal rights organizations have raised concerns about March of Dimes-funded medical research involving animals.<ref>{{cite web|title=March of Crimes: A website run by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]]|url=http://marchofcrimes.com/|accessdate=April 17, 2008}}</ref> The foundation states it supports the use of non-animal research alternatives wherever possible.

==Criticism==

In his book ''Essentials of Sociology: A Down-To-Earth Approach'', sociologist Professor James M. Henslin describes March of Dimes as a [[bureaucracy]] that has taken on a life of its own through a classic example of a process called goal displacement.  Faced with redundancy after Jonas Salk discovered the polio vaccine, it adopted a new mission, "fighting birth defects", which was recently changed to a vaguer goal of "breakthrough for babies", rather than disbanding.<ref>http://wps.ablongman.com/ab_henslin_sociology_7/19/5062/1295985.cw/content/index.html</ref><ref>{{cite book |title= Organizations: Management Without Control|last= Greenwald|first= Howard P.|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2007|publisher= Sage Publications, Inc.|location= |isbn= 1-4129-4247-0|pages= 369}}</ref> 

[[Charity Navigator]] has given the organization a rating of two stars (out of four), meaning "Meets or nearly meets industry standards but underperforms most charities in its Cause." It also notes that president Jennifer Howse's compensation was $631,877 in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=4045|title= Charity Navigator Rating - March of Dimes|accessdate=2012-11-08 |format= |work= }}</ref>
