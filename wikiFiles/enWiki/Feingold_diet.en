The '''Feingold diet'''  is a food elimination program developed by [[Ben F. Feingold]], MD to treat [[hyperactivity]]. It eliminates a number of [[food coloring|artificial color]]s and [[artificial flavor]]s, [[aspartame]], three petroleum-based [[preservative]]s, and (at least initially) certain [[salicylate]]s. There has been much debate about the efficacy of this program. The mainstream medical establishment dismissed it as an "outmoded approach" lacking evidence and efficacy,<ref>{{cite journal

The debate has continued for more than 30 years, involving not only consumers and physicians, but scientists, politicians, and the pharmaceutical and food industries.

==The Feingold Program==
The Feingold Program eliminates three groups of synthetic [[food additive]]s and one class of synthetic [[Sugar substitute|sweetener]]s:

*synthetic [[food coloring|colors]] ([[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|FD&C]] and D&C colors)
*synthetic [[flavor]]s (several thousand different chemicals)
*synthetic [[preservatives]] ([[Butylated hydroxyanisole|BHA]], [[Butylated hydroxytoluene|BHT]], and [[TBHQ]])
*artificial sweeteners ([[Aspartame]], [[Neotame]], and [[Alitame]])

The above-listed colorings and preservatives are made from [[petroleum]].<ref name="FDA-petroleum">

For example, [[titanium dioxide]] and coloring made from iron oxides are acceptable, posing no problem for most people. Only FD&C and D&C colorings are eliminated.  There are thousands of synthetic flavorings, from a variety of sources, most of which are not specified in ingredient lists.  Due to the "[[de minimis]]" principle,<ref name="TTC">

During the initial weeks of the program, certain foods containing [[salicylates]] are removed and may later be reintroduced and tested for tolerance, one at a time.  Most of the problematic salicylate-rich foods are common
temperate-zone fruits, as well as a few vegetables, spices, and one tree nut. During this early period, foods like [[pear]]s, [[cashew]]s and [[banana]]s are used instead of foods like [[apple]]s, [[almond]]s and
[[grape]]s.

Contrary to popular misconception, [[soft drink]]s, [[chocolate]] and [[sugar]] have never been eliminated on the Feingold Program, although moderation is encouraged when consuming such items. Families can often continue to eat the types of food to which they are accustomed, including desserts.  It is a matter of picking brands free of the unwanted additives.  Most of the acceptable foods are easily available at [[supermarket]]s.

==History==

Dr. Feingold was a pediatrician and allergist, and was considered a pioneer in the fields of [[allergy]] and [[immunology]].<ref>{{cite book

===First recorded case===

Since the 1940s, researchers worldwide had discussed cross-reactions of [[aspirin]] (a common [[salicylate]]) and [[Tartrazine]] (FD&C Yellow #5).<ref name="history tartrazine">

  }}</ref>  at the [[Mayo Clinic]] and later Dr. Feingold at Kaiser, found that eliminating both salicylates and synthetic food additives from patients' diets not only eliminated allergic-type reactions, but also induced behavioral changes in some of their patients.

The first clear case for Dr. Feingold was an adult patient referred to him for treatment of her severe [[hives]] in 1965.<ref>{{cite book | author=Feingold, B.F.
| title=Why Your Child is Hyperactive (pp.1-2)| publisher=Random House
| year=1985 | isbn=0-394-73426-2}}</ref>  Typical treatments had not worked for her.  Dr. Feingold placed her on a low-salicylate diet with no synthetic coloring or flavoring. Soon her hives were gone, and the patient was happy.

Ten days later, however, her psychiatrist called Dr. Feingold to ask, "What did you do to my patient?" She had been receiving treatment for a [[personality disorder]] for years, but in less than two weeks on the diet, her behavior had noticeably improved.  Both doctors were puzzled.  Dr. Feingold asked his staff to watch for other patients who did not respond to standard treatments. He suggested the diet regimen to them, and sometimes it worked. As more reports of behavioral improvement came in, he began to use the diet for people - especially children - with behavioral problems as well as allergy, and eventually found the diet often worked for children with behavioral problems even without allergy symptoms.

He named the diet the K-P Diet for Kaiser-Permanente (and he liked the pun of "K-P" as Kitchen Police).<ref>{{cite book | author=Feingold, B.F.
| title=Why Your Child is Hyperactive (p.37)
| publisher=Random House
| year=1985 | isbn=0-394-73426-2}}</ref> Later, as this diet became more well known for helping [[hyperactive]] and [[learning disabled]] children, the media dubbed it the "Feingold diet."

===Early use of the K-P / Feingold diet===

In his early work with children (and adults) who suffered from what was then called "minimal brain dysfunction" (MBD), Hyperkinesis, or Hyperkinesis-Learning Disability (H-LD), Dr. Feingold found that response was variable, depending on the age of the child and the presence or absence of a history suggestive of neurological damage. In 1976, he reported that in five separate programs, totalling 360 children managed with the K-P diet, 30% to 50% of them showed favorable responses and could be removed from medication.<ref>{{cite journal

In 1977, Dr. Arnold Brenner published a study he had begun with the intention of disproving Dr. Feingold's claims.  Of 32 children who had been under various medication treatments for years with poor success, and who were now put on the K-P diet, 11 (about 33%) were "markedly improved."  Surprised, Dr. Brenner wrote that "the startling changes in patients who had been followed for years with other forms of therapy suggest strongly that this improvement was genuine."<ref>{{cite journal

In the beginning, Dr. Feingold did not eliminate the preservatives [[Butylated hydroxyanisole|BHA]] or [[Butylated hydroxytoluene|BHT]].  By 1979, he reported having treated over 600 children with the diet, and that his success rate had risen to 60-70% once he had begun eliminating the preservatives as well.<ref>{{cite journal

===Initial controversy===

In late 1972, Dr. Feingold was invited to present his findings at the annual conference of the [[American Medical Association]] in June 1973, which he did.<ref>{{cite journal

Dramatic improvement in behavior was repeated in this group as well.  Dr. Feingold was again invited to participate in the June 1974 AMA conference, where he reported on 169 children in five separate samples that had experienced a success rate of 30 to 50 percent, depending on the age of the child and the sample. (Note, this was also before the diet eliminated preservatives.)

This led to the first controlled double-blind crossover study, at the University of Pittsburgh, which was funded by the National Institute of Education. It was directed by Dr. C. Keith Connors, with Dr. Feingold as consultant, and the favorable results were published in the August 1976 issue of ''Pediatrics'', the official publication of the American Academy of Pediatrics.<ref>{{cite journal

Meanwhile, in 1974, the food industry became involved via its industry-supported organization called the "Nutrition Foundation of New York."<ref name="press"/>  This is an organization whose members included [[Dow Chemical]], [[Coca Cola]], and several companies who make, use, and distribute the [[food additives]] removed from the K-P diet.<ref>[http://www.feingold.org/nut.html Feingold Association website: Who is the Nutrition Foundation?]</ref>  In December, 1974, the Nutrition Foundation issued a "proposal for the study of dietary relationship to hyperkenesis" which promised, in its final paragraph, that "no publicity will be given to the findings until the committee has approved the report for release."   A two-week long conference, by invitation only, was arranged in January, 1975, in Glen Cove, Long Island.  There, they created what they called the National Advisory Committee, which was not government-related in any way. One week later - and certainly long before any of the planned studies had been done, let alone published - this committee widely published its preliminary report concluding that "no controlled studies have demonstrated that hyperkinesis is related to the ingestion of food additives."<ref name="press"/>

This conclusion is still quoted today, more than 30 years later.<ref name="Quackwatch">[http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/feingold.html Quackwatch website page]</ref><ref>[http://www.nncc.org/Nutrition/hyper.html Elisabeth Schafer, Iowa State University Professor, quoted in National Network for Child Care website]</ref> Adding to the confusion is the assumption that the National Advisory Committee is a governmental agency rather than an arm of industry. Over the next few years, the Nutrition Foundation funded and designed several small studies, each concluding that the diet produced little effect.<ref>{{cite journal

Meanwhile, the media had begun calling the K-P Diet the "Feingold Diet," but because of the confusion with weight-loss diets, and because more than just food is involved in the management of ADHD suggested by the Feingold Association, the "Feingold Diet" was renamed the "Feingold Program."

==Research findings==
{{Original research|date=September 2007}}
Many studies show that 70% or more of hyperactive children respond positively to the removal of synthetic additives, especially when salicylates or allergens are removed.<ref name="Rowe94"/><ref name="Boris94"/> There is controversy, however, over what happens when researchers take children whose behavior has improved on a diet that eliminates several thousand additives, and then challenge them with one or a few additives, usually synthetic colors.

Especially in the early studies, if such a challenge did not produce a change in behavior, researchers often concluded that the diet had not directly caused the initial improvement in behavior.  Rather, the assumption was that the improvement had been due to a placebo effect.

There are other possible reasons for the failure of a challenge to evoke a response, however.  For example, the amount of additive used as a challenge might have been too small to cause an effect.<ref name="Rimland83"/>  Rowe & Rowe in 1994 found a dose-related effect; the higher the amount of coloring used in the double-blind challenge, the stronger (and longer) the reaction of the children.<ref name="Rowe94">

Considering that in 1976 an FDA scientist estimated that children may be consuming up to 315&nbsp;mg food dye per day,<ref name="CSPI">[http://www.cspinet.org/new/adhd_resch_bk02.pdf Center for Science in the Public Interest, Quarter-Century Review, pg.11]</ref> all the above studies appear to be overly conservative in their choice of challenge amounts.
In addition, the effect of an additive might only be seen in [[synergy]] with other additives or foods,<ref name="Lau06" /> or the additive used for the challenge may simply not be among those causing the original effect.<ref name="CSPI"/>

===Early studies===

As with many new developments, the first reports of improvement of behavior via diet were anecdotal.  This was followed by clinical trials and eventually by larger, double-blind placebo-controlled studies.

In 1976, a double-blind crossover diet trial found that both parents and teachers saw fewer hyperkinetic symptoms on the K-P diet as compared to the pretreatment baseline.<ref name="Conners76">

Seven small studies adding up to a total of 190 children were published starting in the late 1970s. Some of them were elaborate double-blind diet studies using a Feingold-type diet.  In some of these studies, the children were taken off their medication, while in others, they continued on stimulant medications including artificial colorants, in spite of the interference that this would create with the diet.

One of the studies in 1978,<ref name="Harley78">

The teachers of the school-aged children did not record any improvement, but 63% of the mothers reported improved behavior, as well as 100% of the mothers of the preschoolers; however, since the improvement was reported by the parents of the children rather than teachers, and [[locomotor system|locomotor]] activity tests were unaffected, it was reported that there was "no diet effect."

In 1980 the Nutrition Foundation set up a review team to review studies related to the Feingold diet.<ref name="nac">Wender EH, Lipton MA. The National Advisory Committee Report on Hyperkinesis and Food Additives -- Final Report to the Nutrition Foundation. Washington D.C: The Nutrition Foundation, 1980.</ref> They published a report that stated that there was no response at all to the diet.  In 1983, the review team's co-chairman and a colleague reviewed a variety of studies and concluded that no more than 2% of children respond adversely to dye additives.<ref name="Lipton83"/>

An influential comparative diet study was conducted in 1987 by Gross et al.<ref name="Gross87">

This was a study of 39 children, of whom 18 were hyperactive, and the balance had other learning disorders. Of those 18, all but one were on behavior-modifying medications during the entire study.  The researchers provided a Feingold-type diet for a single week that was, by their own description, unpalatable.  They particularly noted that the children missed mustard and ketchup; however, mustard is not eliminated by the Feingold diet, and no reason was given for its exclusion.

This diet week was followed by an additive-rich diet the next week.  Although the study reported that the camp director and all teachers felt that the children were noisier and more active during the second, additive-rich week, they discounted these observations in favor of filmed 4-minute sequences made during meals.  These films were intended to measure reaction to additives in the meals in spite of the fact that any such reaction would not be expected to occur for some time after eating.

During the course of the study, three children were dropped: one who was not on stimulant medication, whose behavior became worse during the second week; one who refused to behave altogether; and one whose dose of [[Cylert]] became "inadequate" and whose behavior worsened when additives were allowed during the second week.

They concluded that the "Feingold diet has no beneficial effect on most children with learning disorders" and moreover that the diet was "distasteful to the typical American child."

===Later studies===

A number of studies conducted since 1980 using diets similar to the Feingold Program report greater than 70% of children responding positively to the diets.  Others that eliminated synthetic colors and flavors, but included salicylates still reported greater than 50% positive response.<ref name="Rowe94" /><ref name="Boris94" /><ref name="Rowe88">

In the biggest such study ever performed, published in 1986, the performance of over a million children in 803 New York City public schools was studied for seven years. The children's average standardized test scores rose 8.1% when levels of [[sucrose]] (normal table sugar) were restricted to 11 percent along with the removal of two synthetic food colors; when the remaining food colors and all artificial flavors were removed the next academic year, performance rose another 3.8%; when no further changes were made the following academic year, test performance also remained stable; finally, when the petroleum-based preservatives BHT and BHA were removed from the menu in the next academic year, performance improved another 3.7% for an overall improvement of 15.7% in mean national percentile rankings (from 39.2% to 54.9%).<ref name="Schoenthaler86">

Although it appears that improvement increases as the diet approaches the guidelines of the Feingold Program, the researchers suggest that by removing sugar and additives - thereby removing [[empty calorie]]s and processed foods - malnutrition is reduced. It is not clear what portion of the effects can be contributed to limiting sugar intake or the foods containing BHT and BHA (the related preservative TBHQ did not exist at that time) and what portion can be attributed to the removal of the artificial colorants themselves.

A most important and often overlooked detail in this study is that all the children did not improve equally.  There was a dramatic decline in learning disabled and repeat-failure children.  In 1979, 12.4% of the million children were performing two or more grades below their proper level. By the end of the study in 1983, the percent of children two or more grades below proper level had dropped to 4.9%.  Moreover, before the dietary changes, the more school food that was consumed, the worse the children did academically.  After the changes, however, the more school food the children ate, the better they did academically.<ref name="Schoenthaleranalysis86">

The study concluded that artificial colors or a sodium benzoate preservative (or both) in the diet result in increased hyperactivity in 3-year-old and 8/9-year-old children in the general population. In response to this study and a massive media and grass-roots campaign, the major supermarket chains in the UK have removed additives from their house brands. Several American-based candy companies have done the same with the candies they sell in the UK.

In response to that study, which had been financed by Britain’s [[Food Standards Agency]] and published online by the British medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] concluded that a low-additive diet is a valid intervention for children with [[ADHD]]. It released the following statement in the February 2008 issue of its publication, ''AAP Grand Rounds'':

<blockquote>“Although quite complicated, this was a carefully conducted study in which the investigators went to great lengths to eliminate bias and to rigorously measure outcomes. The results are hard to follow and somewhat inconsistent. For many of the assessments there were small but statistically significant differences of measured behaviors in children who consumed the food additives compared with those who did not. In each case increased hyperactive behaviors were associated with consuming the additives. For those comparisons in which no statistically significant differences were found, there was a trend for more hyperactive behaviors associated with the food additive drink in virtually every assessment. Thus, the overall findings of the study are clear and require that even we skeptics, who have long doubted parental claims of the effects of various foods on the behavior of their children, admit we might have been wrong.”</blockquote>

==Criticism of Feingold diet==
Over the years, a number of criticisms of the Feingold Program have been presented.  Many of these center on the difficulty in avoiding synthetic additives, especially in processed or fast food or while eating out, or with social or emotional side-effects the diet may cause.  Others center on the range of symptoms claimed to be improved by the Feingold Program.

===Food- and diet-related issues===
Some critics say that the Feingold Program requires a significant change in family lifestyle and eating patterns because families are limited to a narrow selection of foods, and that such foods are often expensive, and must be prepared "from scratch", greatly increasing the amount of time and effort a family must put into preparing a meal.<ref name="Quackwatch"/> However, the Feingold Association publishes a ''Foodlist & Shopping Guide'' that provides thousands of acceptable brand-name items to choose from, including many convenience foods available in local supermarkets.  The Foodlist books are organized by region (seven regions in the U.S., one encompassing Canada).  They also provide a ''Fast Food & Restaurant Guide'' as well as other help.

Like any change in diet, the Feingold Program does require that patients make changes in the food that they eat.  However, these changes do not usually require significant changes in the types or cost of food a family may choose or the way a family chooses to prepare them.  Such choices can be more difficult when little is known about the exact ingredients used in a product, such as at a restaurant or when purchasing food from a vending machine.  This requires that a family identify restaurants or products that are not likely to create a problem. Questionable choices can also be avoided by bringing appropriate food when necessary, such as bringing a lunch to school.  Parents are encouraged to keep treats available at home and school, so that the children never need feel deprived or left out.<ref name="handbook">
{{The Feingold Program Handbook, page 36}}
</ref>

Nutritionally, the Feingold Program is little different from a normal diet.  While some fruits and a few vegetables are eliminated in the first weeks of the Program, they are replaced by others.  Often, some or all of these items can be returned to the diet, once the level of tolerance is determined.  Studies have found that children on the Feingold Program actually ate better than those eating a "usual" diet, and were more likely to achieve the [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]] (RDA) of various nutrients.<ref name="Dumbrell78">

===Psychological or behavioral issues===
Other critics express concerns about social or emotional effects of putting children on a specific diet.  These include that their self-esteem may be undermined by implanting notions that they are unhealthy and fragile, or that children may experience situations in which the children's eating behavior or "fear of chemicals" are regarded as peculiar by other children.

No clinical evidence supports these speculations, although the attitude of the parents may be important.  The issues that a child on the Feingold Program faces are very similar to the issues that a child with an allergy to a common product such as eggs or peanuts must deal with, or a medical condition such as diabetes.  Compared to these situations, the Feingold Program could be seen as relatively liberal, as it includes sugary foods, junk foods and even fast food.

===Treating multiple symptoms===
Some feel that it is absurd to think that one intervention could improve symptoms as diverse as asthma, allergies, bedwetting, chronic ear infections, headaches, and insomnia all at once.  Critics point to the fact that effectiveness against a wide range of unrelated symptoms is frequently a hallmark of treatments that work via the [[placebo effect]].

The diet was originally designed as a diagnostic elimination diet to improve food-related asthma and allergic reactions and was only later found to also be effective in treating behavioral issues.  In addition, many children with ADHD suffer from multiple [[comorbid]] symptoms.  It has been found that there is a profile of the child most likely to benefit from the diet.

==Support for parents==
{{Primary sources|section|date=February 2010}}
Dr. Feingold wrote a book directed to parents, entitled ''Why Your Child is Hyperactive,''<ref>
{{cite book | author=Feingold, B.F. | title=Why Your Child is Hyperactive
| publisher=Random House | year=1985 | isbn=0-394-73426-2}}
</ref> as well as ''The Feingold Cookbook'',<ref>{{cite book | author=Feingold, B.F.
| title=The Feingold Cookbook for Hyperactive Children | publisher=Random House
| year=1979 | isbn=0-394-73664-8}}</ref> written in collaboration with his wife, Helene.  In addition, more up-to-date books have also been published.

As parents began using this diet for their children, many saw dramatic success and formed grass roots support groups. When they gathered in 1976 to form a non-profit national organization, they chose the name "Feingold Association" to honor Dr. Feingold.  As time passed, due to the increasing number of double-income families, fewer mothers were available to run these local "kitchen table" support groups, and today the Feingold Association of the United States provides member support services. Recently, some support has been added for Canadian members, and there is some information on the website suitable for people in other countries, as well.

The Feingold Association provides information and support for those starting the Program. Members can purchase comprehensive materials<ref name="Program">
