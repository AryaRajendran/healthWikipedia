'''Dermatophagia''' (sufferers can be called '''wolf-biters''') is a type of Impulse Control Disorder wherein a sufferer compulsively bites his or her own skin.<ref name="wrondia">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/d/dermatophagia/intro.htm|title=Dermatophagia|accessdate=2008-09-21|publisher=Adviware Pty Ltd|work=wrongdiagnosis.com}}</ref><ref name="ncbi">{{cite journal |author=Scott MJ, Scott MJ |title=Dermatophagia: "wolf-biter" |journal=Cutis |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=19–20 |year=1997 |month=January |pmid=9013066 }}</ref><ref name="produkte">{{Cite journal |url=http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&ArtikelNr=70535&Ausgabe=229178&ProduktNr=224228&filename=70535.pdf |title=Dermatophagia Simulating Callosities |year=2003|author=Al Aboud, Khalid; V.

While this disorder involves behavioral symptoms appearing compulsive in nature, Dermatophagia is not (as is commonly mistaken) classifiable or diagnosable as Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, a type of anxiety disorder; rather, it is most widely recognized as an impulse control disorder,<ref>{{cite web|last=AST Consultancy|title=Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): ICD (Impulse Control Disorders)|url=http://www.cbtsouthwest.co.uk/icd.html}}</ref>  and is coded in the ''DSM-IV TR'' as 312.30 Impulse Control Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). The behavior associated with skin-biting is not exclusively the compulsory response to anxious/obsessive cognition; it is impulsive, and while the skin-biting may present with anxiety/obsessive thoughts, the presence of anxiety/obsessions is not diagnostically required to precede the behavior (while such anxiety/obsessions are diagnostically required with OCD). 

However, contemporary research suggests a link between impulse control disorders and Obsessive Compulsive Disorders,<ref>{{cite web|last=Grant, et al.|title=Impulse-control disorders in children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder.|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20004481|publisher=PubMed.gov (NCBI)}}</ref> and this is rumored to be addressed in the ''DSM 5'', due for publication in May of 2013. <ref>{{cite web|title=Nail-Biting May Be Classified As OCD In New DSM|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/01/nail-biting-ocd-obsessive-compulsive-disorder_n_2060183.html?utm_hp_ref=mostpopular|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|last=American Psychiatric Association|title=DSM-5: The Future of Psychiatric Diagnosis|url=http://www.dsm5.org/Pages/Default.aspx|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref> Further information on differentiation between OCD, other anxiety disorders, and Dermatophagia and other impulse-control disorders can be found in the ''DSM-IV TR.'' <ref name="DSM-IV TR">{{cite book|last=American Psychiatric Association|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disoders (4th. ed., text revision)|year=2000|location=Washington, DC: Author}}</ref> 

==Behavior==

Dermatophagia sufferers chew their skin out of compulsion, and can do so on a variety of places on their body.<ref name="produkte"/> Sufferers typically chew the skin surrounding their fingernails and joints. They could also chew on the inside of their mouth, cheeks, and/or lips, causing blisters in and outside of the mouth. If the behavior is left unchecked for an extended period, calluses may start to develop where most of the biting is done.<ref name="produkte"/>

Skin chewing can be bolstered by times of apprehension and other unpleasant events.<ref name="produkte"/> [[Blister]]s in particular can cause a feeling of desire to pull or bite off the affected skin (since the skin is dead, thus easily pulled off), which could be detrimental, causing [[infection]]. Another disorder, known as [[dermatillomania]], the act of picking at one's skin, can sometimes accompany dermatophagia.
People who suffer from dermatophagia can also be prone to infection as when they bite their fingers so frequently, they make themselves vulnerable to bacteria seeping in and causing infection. 
Dermatophagia can be considered a "sister" disorder to [[Trichophagia]], which involves compulsively biting and eating one's hair.<ref name="FingerFreak.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fingerfreak.com/related-disorders-and-habits/dermatophagia|title=Dermatophagia|accessdate=April 27, 2009|publisher=FingerFreak.com|work=fingerfreak}}</ref>
