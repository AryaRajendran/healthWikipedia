A '''neural pathway''', '''neural tract''', or '''neural face''',  connects one part of the [[nervous system]] with another and usually consists of bundles of elongated, [[myelin]]-insulated [[neuron]]s, known collectively as [[white matter]]. Neural pathways serve to connect relatively distant areas of the [[brain]] or nervous system, compared to the local communication of [[grey matter]].

==Naming of neural pathways==
The first named pathways are evident to the naked eye even in a poorly-preserved [[brain]], and were named by the great anatomists of the [[Renaissance]] using cadaver material.  Examples of these include the great ''commissures'' of the brain such as the [[corpus callosum]] ([[Latin]], "hard body"; not to be confused with the Latin word "colossus" - the "huge" statue), ''anterior commissure'', and ''posterior commissure''.  Further examples of this (by no means a complete list) include the [[Corticospinal tract|pyramidal tract]], [[cerebral peduncle|crus cerebri]] ([[Latin]], "leg of the brain"), and ''cerebellar peduncles'' ([[Latin]], "little foot of the [[cerebellum]]"). Note that these names describe the ''appearance'' of a structure but give one no information on its function or location.

Later, as [[neuroanatomy|neuroanatomical]] knowledge became more sophisticated, the trend was toward naming pathways by their origin and termination.  For example, the [[nigrostriatal pathway]], which is degenerated in [[Parkinson's disease]], runs from the [[substantia nigra]] ([[Latin]], "black substance") to the [[striatum|corpus striatum]] ([[Latin]], "striped body").  This naming can extend to include any number of structures in a pathway, such that the cerebellorubrothalamocortical pathway originates in the [[cerebellum]], [[synapse]]s in the [[red nucleus]] ("ruber" in Latin), on to the [[thalamus]], and finally terminating in the [[cerebral cortex]].

Sometimes, these two naming conventions coexist.  For example, the name "[[Corticospinal tract|pyramidal tract]]" has been mainly supplanted by [[Corticospinal tract|lateral corticospinal tract]] in most texts.  Note that the "old" name was primarily descriptive, evoking the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|pyramids]] of antiquity, from the appearance of this neural pathway in the [[medulla oblongata]].  The "new" name is based primarily on its origin (in the primary motor [[cerebral cortex|cortex]], [[Brodmann area]] 4) and termination (onto the [[motoneuron|alpha motor neurons]] of the [[spinal cord]]).

== Functional aspects ==
In general, [[neuron]]s receive information either at their [[dendrite]]s or [[cell body|cell bodies]].  The [[axon]] of a nerve cell is, in general, responsible for transmitting information over a relatively long distance.  Therefore, most neural pathways are made up of [[axon]]s.  If the [[axon]]s have [[myelin]] sheaths, then the pathway appears bright white because [[myelin]] is primarily [[lipid]].  If most or all of the axons lack [[myelin]] sheaths (i.e., are ''unmyelinated''), then the pathway will appear a darker beige color, which is generally called ''grey'' ([[British English]], or ''gray'' in [[American English]]).  

Some neurons are responsible for conveying information over long distances.  For example, [[motoneuron|motor neurons]], which travel from the spinal cord to the muscle, can have axons up to a meter in length in humans; the longest axon in the human body is almost two meters long in tall individuals and runs from the great [[toe]] to the [[medulla oblongata]] of the [[brainstem]].  These are archetypical examples of neural pathways.
