'''[[Aspirin]] poisoning''' or '''''salicylism''''' can be acute or chronic. A single overdose may cause acute poisoning; continuous usage of an elevated dosage over long periods of time may cause chronic poisoning.  Acute overdose has a [[mortality rate]] of 2%.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal with a mortality rate of 25%;{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} chronic overdose may be especially severe in children.<ref name="Pediatrics1982-gaudreault">{{cite journal |title=The relative severity of acute versus chronic salicylate poisoning in children: a clinical comparison |journal=Pediatrics |year=1982 |pages=566–9 |volume=70 |issue=4 |pmid=7122154 |month=October |issn=0031-4005 |last1=Gaudreault |first1=P |last2=Temple |last3=Lovejoy Fh |first2=AR |first3=FH}}</ref> Symptoms may range from mild [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], abdominal pain, lethargy, [[tinnitus]], and [[dizziness]] to severe such as [[seizure]] or [[cerebral edema]] depending on the dose consumed.

[[File:Symptoms of aspirin overdose.svg|thumb|Main symptoms of aspirin overdose.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682878.html MedlinePlus > Aspirin] Last Reviewed - 02/01/2009.</ref>]]

Aspirin overdose has potentially serious consequences, sometimes leading to significant [[morbidity]] and [[death]]. Patients with mild [[drug intoxication|intoxication]] frequently have [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], abdominal pain, lethargy, [[tinnitus]], and [[dizziness]]. More significant symptoms occur in more severe poisonings and include [[hyperthermia]], [[tachypnea]], [[respiratory alkalosis]], [[metabolic acidosis]], [[hypokalemia]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[hallucinations]], [[Mental confusion|confusion]], [[seizure]], [[cerebral edema]], and [[coma]]. The most common cause of death following an aspirin overdose is cardiopulmonary arrest usually due to [[pulmonary edema]].<ref name="ActaAnaesthesiol1987-Thisted">{{cite journal |title=Acute salicylate self-poisoning in 177 consecutive patients treated in ICU |year=1987 |pages=312–6 |volume=31 |issue=4 |pmid=3591255 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-6576.1987.tb02574.x |month=May |issn=0001-5172 |last1=Thisted |first1=B |last2=Krantz |last3=Strøom |last4=Sørensen |journal=Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica |first2=T |first3=J |first4=MB}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The acutely [[toxic]] dose of aspirin is generally considered greater than 150&nbsp;mg per kg of body mass.<ref name="Chyka2007">{{cite journal |author=Chyka PA, Erdman AR, Christianson G, Wax PM, Booze LL, Manoguerra AS, Caravati EM, Nelson LS, Olson KR, Cobaugh DJ, Scharman EJ, Woolf AD, Troutman WG |title=Salicylate poisoning: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management |journal=Clinical Toxicology (Philadelphia, Pa.) |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=95–131 |year=2007 |pmid=17364628 |doi=10.1080/15563650600907140}}</ref> Moderate toxicity occurs at doses up to 300&nbsp;mg/kg, severe toxicity occurs between 300 to 500&nbsp;mg/kg, and a potentially lethal dose is greater than 500&nbsp;mg/kg.<ref name="ArchInternMed1981-Temple">{{cite journal |title=Acute and chronic effects of aspirin toxicity and their treatment |year=1981 |pages=364–9 |volume=141 |issue=3 Spec No |pmid=7469627 |doi=10.1001/archinte.141.3.364 |month=February |issn=0003-9926 |last1=Temple |first1=AR |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine}}</ref>  Chronic toxicity may occur following doses of 100&nbsp;mg/kg per day for two or more days.<ref name="ArchInternMed1981-Temple"/>

Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as electrolytes, liver and kidney function, [[urinalysis]], and [[complete blood count]] is undertaken along with frequent checking of [[salicylate]] and [[blood sugar]] levels. [[Arterial blood gas]] assessments will typically find [[alkalosis|respiratory alkalosis]] early in the course of the overdose due to hyperstimulation of the respiratory center, and may be the only finding in a mild overdose. An anion-gap [[metabolic acidosis]] occurs later in the course of the overdose especially if it is a moderate to severe overdose, due to the increase in protons (acidic contents) in the blood.

The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels generally range from 30–100&nbsp;mg/L (3–10&nbsp;mg/dL) after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300&nbsp;mg/L in patients taking high doses and 700–1400&nbsp;mg/L following acute overdose.<ref>R.

==Treatment==
When aspirin overdose is suspected, immediately contact a doctor, or any medical professional if no doctor is available. All overdosed patients should be conveyed to a hospital immediately for assessment. Initial treatment of an acute overdose involves [[resuscitation]] followed by gastric decontamination by administering [[activated charcoal]], which [[Adsorption|adsorbs]] the aspirin in the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. [[gastric lavage|Stomach pumping]] is no longer routinely used in the treatment of poisonings but is sometimes considered if the patient has ingested a potentially lethal amount less than one hour before presentation.<ref name="jtoxclintox2004-vale">{{cite journal |author=Vale JA, Kulig K |title=Position paper: gastric lavage |journal=Journal of Toxicology.

===Intravenous fluids===
Intravenous fluids containing dextrose such as D5W are recommended to keep a urinary output between 2 - 3 ml/kg/hr.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice |last=Marx |first=John |year=2006 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |isbn=978-0-323-02845-5 |page=2341}}</ref>

===Alkalinization of the urine===
[[Sodium bicarbonate]] is given in a significant aspirin overdose (salicylate level greater than 35&nbsp;mg/dl 6 hours after ingestion) regardless of the serum pH as it enhances elimination of aspirin in the urine. It is given until a urine pH between 7.5 and 8.0 is achieved.<ref name=marxp2342>{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice |last=Marx |first=John |year=2006 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |isbn=978-0-323-02845-5 |page=2342}}</ref>

===Dialysis===
[[Hemodialysis]] can be used to enhance the removal of salicylate from the blood. Hemodialysis is usually used in severely poisoned patients; for example, patients with significantly high salicylate blood levels [ 7.25&nbsp;mmol/L (100&nbsp;mg/dL) in acute ingestions or 40&nbsp;mg/dL in chronic ingestions],<ref name=marxp2342/> or significant neurotoxicity (agitation, coma, convulsions), renal failure, pulmonary edema, or cardiovascular instability.<ref name="EmergMed2002-Dargan"/> Hemodialysis also has the advantage of restoring [[electrolyte]] and [[acid-base]] abnormalities while removing salicylate<ref name="Pediatrics1982-gaudreault" />

==Epidemiology==
During the latter part of the 20th century, the number of  poisonings from salicylates  declined, mainly because of the increased popularity of other over-the-counter analgesics such as [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen). Fifty-two deaths involving single-ingredient aspirin were reported in the [[United States]] in 2000; however, in all but three of these cases, the reason for the ingestion of lethal doses was intentional—predominantly suicidal.<ref name="AmJEmergMed2001-Litovitz">{{cite journal |title=2000 Annual report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers Toxic Exposure Surveillance System |year=2001 |pages=337–95 |volume=19 |issue=5 |pmid=11555795 |doi=10.1053/ajem.2001.25272 |month=Sep |issn=0735-6757 |last1=Litovitz |first1=TL |last2=Klein-Schwartz |last3=White |last4=Cobaugh |last5=Youniss |last6=Omslaer |last7=Drab |last8=Benson |journal=The American journal of emergency medicine |first2=W |first3=S |first4=DJ |first5=J |first6=JC |first7=A |first8=BE}}</ref>
