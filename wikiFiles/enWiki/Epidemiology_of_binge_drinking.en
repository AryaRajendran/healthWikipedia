[[Binge drinking]] is more common in men than it is in women. Among students in the USA approximately 50 percent of men and 39 percent of women binge drink. 

Racial differences exist among binge drinking with Hispanics followed by white people having the highest level of binge drinking. Individuals of African descent have a lower level of binge drinking followed by those of Asian descent. In the case of Asians their low level of binge drinking may be due to the presence of the [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] gene ([[ALDH2]], Chromosome 12) in many (but by no means the vast majority) that results in poor metabolism of alcohol which leads to severe adverse effects such as facial flushing.<ref name="Courtney-2009">{{Cite journal | last1 = Courtney | first1 = KE. | last2 = Polich | first2 = J. | title = Binge drinking in young adults: Data, definitions, and determinants. | journal = Psychol Bull | volume = 135 | issue = 1 | pages = 142–56 | month = Jan | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1037/a0014414 | pmid = 19210057 | pmc = 2748736 }}</ref>

Men are more likely to binge drink (up to 81 percent of alcohol binges are done by men) than women and men are also more likely to develop alcohol dependence than women. People who are homozygous for the ALDH2 gene are less likely to binge drink due to severe adverse effects which occur even with moderate amounts of alcohol consumption.

===Singapore===
According to the [http://www.moh.gov.sg/mohcorp/uploadedfiles/Publications/Reports/2005/NHS_2004(Part5).pdf National Health Survey 2004] conducted by the [http://www.hpb.gov.sg Health Promotion Board Singapore], binge drinking is defined as consumption of five or more alcoholic drinks over a short period of time.

The survey results showed that the frequency of binge drinking was 15.6% in males, 11.9% higher than that for females (3.7%). The largest proportion of males and females who binge drink fall within the 18 – 29 age group.

In 2007, [[Asia Pacific Breweries]] Singapore (APBS) spearheaded [[Get Your Sexy Back]] (GYSB), Singapore’s first youth-for-youth initiative to promote responsible and moderate drinking among young adults. The programme seeks to widen awareness and educate individuals about responsible drinking behaviour by raising the [[social currency]] of moderation. The programme engages youths in events and activities that are close to their lifestyles, focusing on four major platforms – Music, Fashion, Sports and Friends to spread the message of responsible drinking.

==Europe==
The drinking age in most countries is either 16 or 18, though in many countries national or regional regulations ban the consumption and/or the sale of alcoholic drinks stronger than beer or wine to those less than 18 years of age. Licensees may sometimes choose to provide beverages such as diluted [[wine]] or beer mixed with lemonade (''shandy'' or'' Lager Top'') with a meal to encourage responsible consumption of alcohol. It is generally perceived that binge drinking is most prevalent in the [[Vodka Belt]] (most of Northern and some of Eastern Europe) and least common in the southern part of the continent, in Italy, France, Portugal and the Mediterranean (the [[Alcohol belts of Europe#Wine belt|Wine Belt]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Alcohol Alert Digest |date=1997 |publisher=Institute of Alcohol Studies UK |url=http://www.ias.org.uk/resources/publications/alcoholalert/alert199701/al199701_p20.html}}</ref> 

Using a "5-drink, 30-days" (5 standard drinks in a row during the last 30 days) definition, Denmark leads European binge drinking, with 60% of 15–16-year-olds reporting participating in this behavior (and 61% reporting intoxication).<ref name=CompareDrinkRate>http://www.udetc.org/documents/CompareDrinkRate.pdf Youth Drinking Rates and Problems: A Comparison of European Countries and the United States (Sources: 2003 ESPAD Survey and 2003 United States Monitoring the Future Survey)</ref> However, there currently appears to be at least some convergence of drinking patterns and styles between the northern and southern countries, with the south beginning to drink more like the north more so than the other way around.

===Malta===
A notable exception to the lower rates of binge drinking in [[Southern Europe]] is the Mediterranean island of [[Malta]], which has adopted the British culture of binge drinking, and where teenagers, often still in their early teens, are able to buy alcohol and drink it in the streets of the main [[nightclub|club]] district, [[Paceville]], due to a lack of police enforcement of the legal drinking age of 17.<ref>{{cite news |title=They’re closing the tap |newspaper=Malta Today |date=15 January 2006 |issue=323 |url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/2006/01/15/t10.html}}</ref> Statistics show that alcohol consumption in Malta exceeds that in the UK (but binge drinking is slightly lower and intoxication is significantly lower),<ref name=CompareDrinkRate/> and report that Malta ranks 5th in the world in common binge drinking.<ref>{{cite news |author=Piscopo, R.V.; D’Emanuele, A.O. |title=Don’t Risk it — sedqa’s new binge-drinking campaign |newspaper=malta INDEPENDENT |date=22 June 2005 |url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2005-06-22/news/dont-risk-it-sedqas-new-binge-drinking-campaign-77082/}}</ref> Maltese 15–16-year-olds report binge drinking at a rate of 50%, using a 5-drink, 30-day definition, but only 20% report intoxication in the past 30 days.<ref name=CompareDrinkRate/>

===Spain===
Since the mid-1990s the [[botellón]] has been growing in popularity among young people. Botellón, which literally means "big bottle" in Spanish, is a drinking party or gathering that involves consuming alcohol, usually spirits (often mixed with soft drinks), in a public or semi-public place (beaches, parks, streets, etc.).  This can be considered a case of binge drinking since most people that attend it consume three to five drinks in less than five hours.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Among 15–16-year-olds, 23% report being intoxicated in the past 30 days.<ref name=CompareDrinkRate/>

{{See|Alcoholism in Russia}}
<!-- [[zapoy]] redirects here-->
Binge drinking in Russia ("''Zapoy''" ("''Запой''") in [[Russian language|Russian]]), often takes the form of two or more days of continuous drunkenness. Sometimes it can even last up to a week.  One study found that among men ages 25–54, about 10% had at least one episode of ''zapoy'' in the past year, which can be taken as a sign that one has a drinking problem.<ref name=Tomkins07>{{cite journal |author=Tomkins S, Saburova L, Kiryanov N, ''et al.'' |title=Prevalence and socio-economic distribution of hazardous patterns of alcohol drinking: study of alcohol consumption in men aged 25–54 years in Izhevsk, Russia |journal=Addiction |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=544–53 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17362291 |pmc=1890567 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2006.01693.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2006.01693.x}}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, parallels have been drawn between binge drinking and the [[Gin Crisis]] of 18th century England.<ref name="historyandpolicy">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-62.html|title=Binge drinking and moral panics: historical parallels??|last=Borsay|first=Peter|date=September 2007|work=History & Policy|publisher=History & Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=[[United Kingdom]]}}</ref> Some areas of the media are spending a great deal of time reporting on what they see as a social ill that is becoming more prevalent as time passes. In 2003, the cost of binge drinking was estimated as £20 billion a year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Binge drinking costing billions |date=19 September 2003 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3121440.stm}}</ref> In response, the [[Her Majesty's Government|government]] has introduced measures to deter disorderly behavior and sales of alcohol to people under 18, with special provisions in place during the holiday season. In January 2005, it was reported that one million admissions to UK [[emergency department]] units each year are alcohol-related; in many cities, Friday and Saturday nights are by far the busiest periods for [[ambulance]] services.

The culture of drinking in the UK is markedly different from that of some other European nations. In mainland Europe, alcohol tends to be consumed more slowly over the course of an evening, often accompanied by a restaurant meal. In Scandinavia, occasional bouts of heavy drinking are the norm. In the UK (as well as [[Ireland]]), by contrast, alcohol is commonly consumed in rapid binges, leading to more regular instances of severe intoxication. In this way the British combine Northern European volumes of consumption with frequency resembling that of Southern Europe. This "drinking urgency" may have been inspired by traditional pre-midnight [[public house|pub]] [[Last call (bar term)|closing hours]] in the UK, whereas bars in continental Europe would typically remain open for the entire night. This may have stemmed from the [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914]], emergency legislation dating back to the [[World War I|first world war]] regulating pub opening times with the intention of getting workers out of the pub and into the [[munitions]] factories. Consequently, it was criticised for being draconian and denying the working classes their pleasures. This is one of the reasons for introducing the [[Licensing Act 2003]] which came into effect in [[England and Wales]] in 2005, and which allows 24 hour licensing (although not all bars have taken advantage of the change). Some observers, however, believed it would exacerbate the problem.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1535010/24-hour-laws-haven't-cured-binge-drinking.html 24-hour laws haven't cured binge drinking] telegraph.co.uk</ref>

===Canada===
Canadian binge drinking rates are comparable to the United States, and resemble most the geographically similar states that border on it. For example, 29% of 15–19-year-olds (35% male, 22% female) and 37% of 20–24-year-olds (47% male, 17.9% female) report having 5 or more drinks on one occasion, 12 or more times a year in 2000–01.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faslink.org/Frequency_of_drinking.htm |title=Frequency of Drinking |publisher=Faslink.org |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref>

In university, binge drinking is especially common during the first week of orientation, commonly known as "frosh week." The first ever known study comparing the drinking patterns of Canadian and American college students under age 25 (in 1998 and 1999, respectively) found that although Canadian students were more likely to drink, American students drank more heavily overall.<ref name="First National Comparison">http://alcoholism.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/cas/Documents/Canadian1%2DpressRelease/ First National Comparison</ref> 

"Heavy alcohol use" was defined as ''usually'' having 5/4 drinks or more on the days that the person drinks in the past 30 days (American) or 2–3 months (Canadian).  Among past year drinkers, 41% and 35% of American and Canadian students, respectively, reported participated in this behavior.  Among the total sample, it was 33% and 30%, respectively. Differences included the lack of a gender gap in Canada compared with America, as well some as age-related differences. Canadians exceeded Americans in reported heavy alcohol use until age 19 (especially among the 1% percentage of students under 18), at which point Americans overtook and then began to exceed Canadians, especially among 21–22-year-olds. After age 23, there was no longer much of a difference.<ref name="First National Comparison" /> In Canada, the legal drinking age is 18 or 19, depending on the province.

A relatively popular drinking game among the Canadian skateboarders and heavy metal culture is "wizard sticks", in which drinkers tape a stack of their empty beer cans to the can from which they are currently drinking.  The name comes from the fact that when the stack gets tall enough, it resembles a wizard's staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jointogether.org/news/headlines/inthenews/2008/wizard-stick-parties-a.html |title='Wizard Stick' Parties a Binge Drinking concern |publisher=Jointogether.org |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref>

Despite having a [[legal drinking age]] of 21, binge drinking in the United States remains very prevalent among high school and college students. Using the popular 5/4 definition of "binge drinking", one study found that, in 1999, 44% of American college students (51% male, 40% female) engaged in this practice at least once in the past two weeks.<ref>{{cite web |author=Wechsler H, ''et al.'' |title=College Binge Drinking in the 1990s: A Continuing Problem.

One can also look at the prevalence of "extreme drinking" as well.  A more recent study of US first-semester college freshmen in 2003 found that, while 41% of males and 34% of females "binged" (using the 5/4 threshold) at least once in the past two weeks, 20% of males and 8% of females drank 10/8 or more drinks (double the 5/4 threshold) at least once in the same period, and 8% of males and 2% of females drank at least 15/12 drinks (triple the threshold).<ref>{{cite journal |author=White AM, Kraus CL, Swartzwelder H |title=Many college freshmen drink at levels far beyond the binge threshold |journal=Alcohol.

A main concern of binge drinking on college campuses is how the negative consequences of binge drinking affect the students.

The population of people who binge drink mainly comprises young adults aged 18–29, although it is by no means rare among older adults.  For example, in 2007 (using a 5-drinks definition per occasion for both genders), 42% of 18–25-year-olds "binged" at least once a month, while 20% of 16–17-year-olds and 19% of those over age 35 did so.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kennet, Joel |chapter=3.

===American Indians and First Nations===
{{See|American Indian alcoholism}}

Binge drinking is a common pattern among [[American Indian alcoholism|Native Americans]] in both Canada and the United States. Anastasia M. Shkilnyk who conducted an observational study of the [[Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation]] of Northwestern Ontario in the late 1970s when they were demoralized by [[Ontario Minamata disease]] has observed that heavy Native American drinkers may not be physiologically dependent on alcohol, but abuse it by engaging in binge drinking, a practice associated with child neglect, violence, and impoverishment. After binges during which entire families and their friends drink until they are unconscious and their funds are exhausted, they go about their business without drinking.<ref name=PSL>{{cite book|title=A Poison Stronger than Love: The Destruction of an Ojibwa Community|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300033257|author=Anestasia M.

===Australia===
In 2004–2005, statistics from the National Health Survey<ref name=ABS2004>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/allprimarymainfeatures/9C513A3DB275E740CA257A0100135A89?opendocument |title=Alcohol Consumption'&#39; in Australia: A Snapshot, 2004–05 |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |date=25 August 2006 |id=4832.0.55.001}}</ref> show that among the general population over 18; 88% of males and 60% of females engaged in binge drinking at least once in the past year, with 12% and 4%, respectively, doing so at least once a week. Among 18- to 24-year-olds, 49% of males and 21% of females did so at least once a week. At the time, the definition for "binge drinking" corresponded to 7 or more standard Australian drinks per occasion for males and 5 or more for females, roughly equivalent to (but slightly less than) the 5/4 (standard American) drinks definition.<ref name=ABS2004/>

In March 2008, the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] earmarked [[Australian dollar|A$]]53 million towards a campaign against binge drinking, citing two studies done in the past eight years which showed that binge drinking in Australia was at what [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Kevin Rudd]] called "epidemic levels".<ref>{{cite web |title=Rudd sets aside $53-million to tackle binge drinking |date=10 March 2008 |work=PM |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2008/s2185516.htm}}</ref> On June 15, the [[Australian Medical Association]] released new guidelines defining binge drinking as four standard Australian drinks a night.<ref>{{cite web |title=Binge drinking on people's minds: AMA” |date=15 June 2008 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/06/15/2275181.htm}}</ref>

The last survey of drinking habits by the Australian Bureau of Statistics found there was an increase in drinking outside the home. In 1999, 34 percent of spending on alcoholic drinks took place on licensed premises. By 2004 this figure had risen to 38 percent. This figure is expected to fall in 2008 in Australia because of stricter licensing laws, smoking bans in pubs and the extra premium people have to pay for buying alcohol in a bar.<ref>{{cite news |author=Lee J |title=Back to the bottle shop as drinkers stay at home |date=24 April 2008 |newspaper=[[The Age]] |url=http://business.theage.com.au/back-to-the-bottle-shop-as-drinkers-stay-at-home/20080423-285p.html}}</ref>

===New Zealand===
Concerns over binge drinking by teenagers has led to a review of liquor advertising being announced by the New Zealand government in January 2006. The review considered regulation of sport sponsorship by liquor companies, which at present is commonplace. Previously the drinking age in New Zealand was 20, then dropped to 18 in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |title=Minimum Drinking and Purchasing Age Laws |date=February 2007 |publisher=International Center for Alcohol Policies |url=http://www.icap.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=DZtSxPV1Vxw%3D&tabid=206 |format=PDF}}</ref>  

In direct conjunction with the age-lowering, the Police were found to strictly enforce the on-license (bar, restaurant) code for underage-drinking, less so for the off-licences (liquor stores, supermarkets).  As a result, young people ages 15–17 found it significantly ''harder'' to get into (or be served at) bars and restaurants than it was before with a poorly enforced (though higher) drinking age of 20. This asymmetric enforcement led to a period of many of New Zealand's youth getting strangers to purchase high alcohol content beverages for them (e.g. cheap vodka or rum) at liquor stores.<ref>{{cite news |author=Palmer A |title=Binge drinking: Does Britain need to look to Italy to solve booze problem?? |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] |date=18 August 2009 |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/08/18/binge-drinking-does-britain-need-to-look-to-italy-to-solve-booze-problem-115875-21604245/ |accessdate=2009-12-20}}</ref> 

A propensity to consume an entire bottle of spirits developed and led to an instant increase in the amount of youths under 18 being admitted to [[Emergency department|A&E]] hospitals.
