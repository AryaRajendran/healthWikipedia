It is uncommonly bilateral.<ref name=pmid1757522>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Skibsted | first1 = L. | last2 = Sperling | first2 = L. | last3 = Hansen | first3 = U. | last4 = Hertz | first4 = J. | title = Salpingitis isthmica nodosa in female infertility and tubal diseases. | journal = Hum Reprod | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 828–31 | month = Jul | year = 1991 | doi =  | PMID = 1757522 }}</ref>
