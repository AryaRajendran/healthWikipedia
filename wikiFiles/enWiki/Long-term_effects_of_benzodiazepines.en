Other concerns about the long-term effects of benzodiazepines, in some, include dose escalation, [[benzodiazepine abuse]], [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[benzodiazepine dependence]] and benzodiazepine withdrawal problems. Both physiological tolerance and dependence can lead to a worsening of the adverse effects of benzodiazepines. Increased risk of death has been associated with long-term use of benzodiazepines in several studies, however, other studies have not found increased mortality. Due to conflicting findings in studies regarding benzodiazepines and increased risks of death including from cancer, further research in long-term use of benzodiazepines and mortality risk has been recommended. Most of the research has been conducted in prescribed users of benzodiazepines; even less is known about the mortality risk of illicit benzodiazepine users.<ref name="Charlson-2009">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Charlson | first1 = F | last2 = Degenhardt | first2 = L | last3 = McLaren | first3 = J | last4 = Hall | first4 = W | last5 = Lynskey | first5 = M | title = A systematic review of research examining benzodiazepine-related mortality | journal = Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 93–103 | month= February| year = 2009 | doi = 10.1002/pds.1694 | pmid = 19125401 }}</ref> The long-term use of benzodiazepines is controversial and has generated significant controversy within the medical profession.

===Effect on sleep===
[[Sleep architecture]] can be adversely affected by benzodiazepine dependence. Possible adverse effects on sleep include induction or worsening of sleep disordered breathing. Long-term use is associated with increased alpha and beta activity, a decrease in [[K complex]]es and delta activity. There is also a decrease in stage 1 NREM, NREM stage 3 and 4 sleep and [[REM sleep]] as well as a decrease in REM sleep eye movements.<ref name="sleep_medicine_a04">{{Cite book | last1 = Lee-chiong | first1 = Teofilo | title = Sleep Medicine: Essentials and Review | date = 24 April 2008 | publisher = Oxford University Press, USA | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=s1F_DEbRNMcC&pg=PT105 | isbn = 0-19-530659-7 | page = 105 }}</ref>

===Mental and physical health===
Long-term benzodiazepine use may lead to the creation or exacerbation of physical and mental health conditions, which improve after 6 or more months of abstinence. After a period of about 3 to 6 months of abstinence after completion of a gradual-reduction regime, marked improvements in mental and physical wellbeing become apparent. For example, one study of hypnotic users gradually withdrawn from their hypnotic medication reported after 6 months of abstinence that they had less severe sleep and anxiety problems, were less distressed, and had a general feeling of improved health. Those having remained on [[hypnotic]] medication had no improvements in their insomnia, anxiety, or general health ratings.<ref name="pmid18377143"/> A study found that individuals having withdrawn from benzodiazepines showed a marked reduction in use of medical and mental health services.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Burke KC, Meek WJ, Krych R, Nisbet R, Burke JD |title=Medical services use by patients before and after detoxification from benzodiazepine dependence |journal=Psychiatr Serv |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=157–60 |year=1995 |month=February |pmid=7712252 |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7712252}}</ref>

Approximately half of patients attending mental health services for conditions including [[anxiety disorders]] such as [[panic disorder]] or [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]] may be the result of alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence. Sometimes anxiety disorders pre-existed [[ethanol|alcohol]] or benzodiazepine dependence but the alcohol or [[benzodiazepine dependence]] often act to keep the anxiety disorders going and often progressively making them worse.<ref name="pmid7769598"/> Many people who are addicted to alcohol or prescribed benzodiazepines when it is explained to them they have a choice between ongoing ill mental health or quitting and recovering from their symptoms decide on quitting alcohol and or their benzodiazepines. It was noted that every individual has an individual sensitivity level to alcohol or sedative hypnotic drugs and what one person can tolerate without ill health another will suffer very ill health and that even moderate drinking in sensitive individuals can cause rebound anxiety syndromes and sleep disorders. A person who is suffering the toxic effects of alcohol or benzodiazepines will not benefit from other therapies or medications as they do not address the root cause of the symptoms. Recovery from benzodiazepine dependence tends to take a lot longer than recovery from alcohol but people can regain their previous good health.<ref name="pmid7769598">{{cite journal |author=Cohen SI |title=Alcohol and benzodiazepines generate anxiety, panic and phobias |journal=J R Soc Med |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=73–7 |year=1995 |month=February |pmid=7769598 |pmc=1295099 |doi= }}</ref> A review of the literature regarding benzodiazepine [[hypnotic]] drugs concluded that these drugs cause an unjustifiable risk to the individual and to public health.

A study of 50 patients who attended a benzodiazepine withdrawal clinic found that long-term use of benzodiazepines causes a wide range of psychological and physiological disorders. It was found that, after several years of chronic benzodiazepine use, a large portion of patients developed various mental and physical health problems including [[agoraphobia]], [[irritable bowel syndrome]], [[paraesthesiae]], increasing anxiety, and [[panic attacks]], which were not preexisting. The mental health and physical health symptoms induced by long-term benzodiazepine use gradually improved significantly over a period of a year following completion of a slow withdrawal. Three of the 50 patients had wrongly been given a preliminary diagnosis of [[multiple sclerosis]] when the symptoms were actually due to chronic benzodiazepine use. Ten of the patients had taken [[drug overdoses]] whilst on benzodiazepines, despite the fact that only two of the patients had any prior history of depressive symptomatology. After withdrawal, no patients took any further overdoses after 1 year post-withdrawal. The cause of the deteriorating mental and physical health in a significant proportion of patients was hypothesised to be caused by increasing tolerance where withdrawal type symptoms emerged, despite the administration of stable prescribed doses.<ref>{{cite journal | author =Professor C Heather Ashton | url =http://www.benzo.org.uk/ashbzoc.htm | year =1987 | title =Benzodiazepine Withdrawal: Outcome in 50 Patients | journal =British Journal of Addiction | volume =82 | pages =655–671 }}</ref> Another theory is that chronic benzodiazepine use causes subtle increasing toxicity, which in turn leads to increasing psychopathology in long-term users of benzodiazepines.<ref>{{cite journal | author =Michelini S |coauthors=Cassano GB, Frare F, Perugi G | year =1996 | month=July | title =Long-term use of benzodiazepines: tolerance, dependence and clinical problems in anxiety and mood disorders | journal =Pharmacopsychiatry | volume =29 |issue=4 | pages =127–34 | pmid =8858711 | doi =10.1055/s-2007-979558}}</ref>

Long-term use of benzodiazepines can induce [[perceptual]] disturbances and [[depersonalisation]] in some people, even in those taking a stable daily dosage, and it can also become a [[protracted withdrawal]] feature of the [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal=J Subst Abuse Treat | year =1991 | volume=8 | issue=1–2 | pages=19–28 | title=Protracted withdrawal syndromes from benzodiazepines | author=Ashton H |pmid=1675688 |url=http://www.benzo.org.uk/ashpws.htm |publisher=benzo.org.uk | doi=10.1016/0740-5472(91)90023-4 }}</ref>

===Carcinogenicity===
There has been some controversy around the possible link between benzodiazepine use and development of cancer; early cohort studies in the 1980s suggested a possible link, but follow-up case-control studies have found no link between benzodiazepines and cancer. In the second U.S. national cancer study in 1982, the [[American Cancer Society]] conducted a survey of over 1.1 million participants. A marked increased risk of cancer was found in the users of sleeping pills, mainly benzodiazepines.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=eurekah.section.28844| title = Mortality Associated with Prescription Hypnotics| author = Daniel F.

The cancers included cancer of the [[brain]], [[lung]], [[bowel]], [[breast]], and [[bladder]], and other [[neoplasms]]. It has been hypothesised that either depressed immune function or the viral infections themselves were the cause of the increased rates of cancer. While initially [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] reviewers expressed concerns about approving the [[nonbenzodiazepine]] [[Z drugs]] due to concerns of cancer, ultimately they changed their minds and approved the drugs.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Kripke | first = Daniel F | year = 2008 | title = Evidence That New Hypnotics Cause Cancer | journal = Department of Psychiatry, UCSD | publisher = University of California | url = http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=ucsdpsych | format = PDF | quote = the likelihood of cancer causation is sufficiently strong now that physicians and patients should be warned that hypnotics possibly place patients at higher risk for cancer.}}</ref> A recent case-control study, however, found no link between use of benzodiazepines and cancers of the breast, lung, large bowel, lung, uterine lining, ovaries, testes, thyroid, liver, or Hodgkin's Disease, melanoma, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rosenberg L |title=Relation of benzodiazepine use to the risk of selected cancers: breast, large bowel, malignant melanoma, lung, endometrium, ovary, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, testis, Hodgkin's disease, thyroid, and liver |journal=Am.

===Brain damage speculation===
In a study in 1980 in a group of 55 consecutively admitted patients having abused exclusively sedatives or hypnotics, neuropsychological performance was significantly lower and signs of intellectual impairment significantly more often diagnosed than in a matched control group taken from the general population. These results suggested a relationship between abuse of sedatives or hypnotics and cerebral disorder.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Borg S |coauthors= Bergman H, Holm L. |title=Neuropsychological impairment and exclusive abuse of sedatives or hypnotics |journal=The American journal of psychiatry. |volume=137 |issue=2 |pages=215–7 |date=1 February 1980|url=http://www.ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/137/2/215 |pmid=7352578 }}</ref>

A publication has asked in 1981 if [[lorazepam]] is more toxic than [[diazepam]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=van Hiele LJ |title=[Can lorazepam be distinguished from other short-acting benzodiazepines in regard to brain damage and withdrawal symptoms?] |language=Dutch; Flemish |journal=Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd |volume=125 |issue=4 |pages=156 |year=1981 |month=January |pmid=6111030 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

In a study in 1984, 20 patients having taken long-term benzodiazepines were submitted to brain CT scan examinations. Some scans appeared abnormal. The mean ventricular/brain area measured by planimetry was increased over mean values in an age- and sex-matched group of control subjects but was less than that in a group of alcoholics. There was no significant relationship between CT scan appearances and the duration of benzodiazepine therapy. The clinical significance of the findings was unclear.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=6143338 |year=1984 |month=Feb |author=Lader, Mh; Ron, M; Petursson, H |title=Computed axial brain tomography in long-term benzodiazepine users |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=203–6 |issn=0033-2917 |journal=Psychological Medicine |url= |format= |doi=10.1017/S0033291700003214 }}</ref>

In 1986, it was presumed that permanent brain damage may result from chronic use of benzodiazepines similar to [[alcohol-related brain damage]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2872582 |url=http://www.benzo.org.uk/lennane.htm |year=1986 |month=May |author=Lennane, Kj |title=Treatment of benzodiazepine dependence |volume=144 |issue=11 |pages=594–7 |issn=0025-729X |journal=The Medical journal of Australia }}</ref> 

In 1987, 17 high-dose inpatient abusers of benzodiazepines have anecdotally shown enlarged [[cerebrospinal fluid]] spaces with associated brain shrinkage.
Brain shrinkage reportedly appeared to be dose dependent with low-dose users having less brain shrinkage than higher-dose users.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2893406 |year=1987 |month=Nov |author=Schmauss, C; Krieg, Jc |title=Enlargement of cerebrospinal fluid spaces in long-term benzodiazepine abusers |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=869–73 |issn=0033-2917 |journal=Psychological Medicine |url= |format= |doi=10.1017/S0033291700000660 }}</ref>

In 1989, in a 4- to 6-year follow-up study of 30 inpatient benzodiazepine abusers, [[Neuropsychological]] function was found to be permanently affected in some chronic high-dose abusers of benzodiazepines . [[Brain damage]] similar to [[alcoholic]] brain damage was observed. The [[CT scan]] abnormalities showed dilatation of the [[ventricular system]]. However, unlike alcoholics, sedative hypnotic abusers showed no evidence of widened [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] [[sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]]. The study concluded that, when [[Cerebrum|cerebral]] disorder is diagnosed in sedative hypnotic benzodiazepine abusers, it is often permanent.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Borg S |coauthors= Bergman H, Engelbrektson K, Vikander B. |title=Dependence on sedative-hypnotics: neuropsychological impairment, field dependence and clinical course in a 5-year follow-up study |journal=British journal of addiction. |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=547–53 |year=1989 |pmid=2743035 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1989.tb00612.x }}</ref>

Withdrawal from high-dose abuse of [[nitrazepam]] anecdotally was alleged in 2001 to have caused severe [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] of the whole brain with diffuse slow activity on [[EEG]] in one patient after 25 years of abuse. After withdrawal, abnormalities in hypofrontal brain wave patterns persisted beyond the withdrawal syndrome, which suggested to the authors that organic brain damage occurred from chronic high-dose abuse of nitrazepam.<ref name="pmid11900604">{{cite journal |author=Kitabayashi Y |title=Chronic high-dose nitrazepam dependence 123I-IMP SPECT and EEG studies |journal=Addict Biol |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=257–261 |year=2001 |pmid=11900604 |doi=10.1080/13556210120056507 |author-separator=, |author2=Ueda H |author3=Narumoto J |display-authors=3 |last4=Iizumi |first4=Hideyuki |last5=Tsuchida |first5=Hideto |last6=Murata |first6=Nobufumi |last7=Nakajima |first7=Shosaku |last8=Fukui |first8=Kenji}}</ref>

Professor Ashton, a leading expert on benzodiazepines from [[Newcastle University]] Institute of Neuroscience, has stated that there is no structural damage from benzodiazepines, and advocates for further research into long-lasting or possibly permanent symptoms of long-term use of benzodiazepines as of 1996.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.benzo.org.uk/ashprop.htm | title = Long-Term Effects of Benzodiazepine Usage: Research Proposals, 1995-96 | accessdate = 10 December 2008 | author = Professor C Heather Ashton | publisher = benzo.org.uk | location = University of Newcastle - School of Neurosciences}}</ref> She has stated that she believes that the most likely explanation for lasting symptoms is persisting but slowly resolving functional changes at the [[GABAA|GABA<sub>A</sub>]] [[benzodiazepine receptor]] level.

==History==
Benzodiazepines when introduced in 1961 were widely believed to be safe drugs but as the decades went by increased awareness of [[adverse effects]] connected to their long-term use became known. There was initially widespread public approval but this was followed by widespread public disapproval and recommendations for more restrictive medical guidelines followed.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Marshall | first1 = KP. | last2 = Georgievskava | first2 = Z. | last3 = Georgievsky | first3 = I. | title = Social reactions to Valium and Prozac: a cultural lag perspective of drug diffusion and adoption | journal = Res Social Adm Pharm | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 94–107 | month = Jun | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.sapharm.2008.06.005 | pmid = 19524858 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Fraser AD |title=Use and abuse of the benzodiazepines |journal=Ther Drug Monit |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=481–9 |year=1998 |month=October |pmid=9780123 |doi= 10.1097/00007691-199810000-00007|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0163-4356&volume=20&issue=5&spage=481}}</ref> Concerns regarding the long-term effects of benzodiazepines have been raised since 1980.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Edwards RA, Medlicott RW |title=Advantages and disadvantages of benzodiazepine prescription |journal=N.

In 1980, the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]]'s [[Committee on the Safety of Medicines]] issued guidance restricting the use of benzodiazepines to short-term use and updated and strengthened these warnings in 1988. When asked by [[Phil Woolas]] in 1999 whether the Department of Health had any plans to conduct research into the long-term effects of benzodiazepines, the Department replied, saying they have no plans to do so, as benzodiazepines are already restricted to short-term use and monitored by regulatory bodies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1999/nov/11/benzodiazepine#S6CV0337P0_19991111_CWA_817 |title=Benzodiazepine |author=Yvette Cooper |authorlink=Yvette Cooper |coauthors=[[Phil Woolas]] |date=11 November 1999 |publisher=Handsard, UK Parliament |location=United Kingdom }}</ref> In a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debate, Phil Woolas has claimed that there has been a cover-up with regard to the problems associated with benzodiazepines because they are of too large of a scale for governments, regulatory bodies, and the pharmaceutical industry to deal with.

Additionally the APPGITA complaint alleged that there is a "''virtual prohibition''" on the collection of statistical information on benzodiazepines across government departments, whereas with other controlled drugs there are enormous volumes of statistical data. The complaint alleged that the discrimination is deliberate, large scale and that government departments are aware of what they are doing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.addictiontoday.org/files/appg-ita-submission-to-ehrc.pdf |title=ALL-PARTY PARLIAMENTARY GROUP ON INVOLUNTARY TRANQUILLISER ADDICTION, SUBMISSION TO EQUALITIES AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION |author=Michael Behan |coauthors=[[Jim Dobbin]] |date=20 July 2009 |publisher=AddictionToday.org |format=PDF |quote=The discrimination is large scale, long-standing and deliberate.

====Declassified Medical Research Council meeting====
The [[Medical Research Council (UK)]] held a closed meeting among top UK medical doctors and representatives from the pharmaceutical industry between the dates of 30 October 1980 and 3 April 1981. The meeting was classified under the [[Public Records Act 1958]] until 2014 but became available in 2005 as a result of the [[Freedom of Information Act]]. The meeting was called due to concerns that 10–100,000 people could be dependent; this estimate was later revised by the Chairman Professor Malcolm Lader, of the meeting to approximately half a million members of the British public were suspected of being dependent on therapeutic dose levels of benzodiazepines, about half of those on long-term benzodiazepines. It was reported that benzodiazepines may be the third- or fourth-largest drug problem in the UK (the largest being alcohol and tobacco). The Chairman of the meeting followed up after the meeting with additional information, which was forwarded to the Medical Research Council neuroscience board, raising concerns regarding tests that showed definite cortical atrophy in 2 of 14 individuals tested and borderline abnormality in five others. He felt that, due to the methodology used in assessing the scans, the abnormalities were likely an underestimate, and more refined techniques would be more accurate. Also discussed were findings that tolerance to benzodiazepines can be demonstrated by injecting diazepam into long-term users; in normal subjects, increases in [[growth hormone]] occurs, whereas in benzodiazepine-tolerant individuals this effect is blunted. Also raised were findings in animal studies that showed the development of tolerance in the form of a 15 percent reduction in binding capacity of benzodiazepines after seven days administration of high doses of the partial agonist benzodiazepine drug [[flurazepam]] and a 50 percent reduction in binding capacity after 30 days of a low dose of diazepam. The Chairman was concerned that papers soon to be published would "''stir the whole matter up''" and wanted to be able to say that the Medical Research Council "''had matters under consideration if questions were asked in parliament''". The Chairman felt that it "''was very important, politically that the MRC should be 'one step ahead'''" and recommended epidemiological studies be funded and carried out by Roche Pharmaceuticals and MRC sponsored research conducted into the biochemical effects of long-term use of benzodiazepines. The meeting aimed to identify issues that were likely to arise, alert the Department of Health to the scale of the problem and identify the pharmacology and nature of benzodiazepine dependence and the volume of benzodiazepines being prescribed. The [[World Health Organisation]] was also interested in the problem and it was felt the meeting would demonstrate to the WHO that the MRC was taking the issue seriously. Among the psychological effects of long-term use of benzodiazepines discussed was a reduced ability to cope with stress. The Chairman stated that the "''withdrawal symptoms from valium were much worse than many other drugs including, e.g., heroin''". It was stated that the likelihood of withdrawing from benzodiazepines was "''reduced enormously''" if benzodiazepines were prescribed for longer than four months. It was concluded that benzodiazepines are often prescribed inappropriately, for a wide range of conditions and situations. Dr Mason ([[Department of Health (UK)|DHSS]]) and Dr Moir ([[SHHD]]), felt it important to determine the effectiveness and toxicity of benzodiazepines due to the large numbers of people using benzodiazepines for long periods of time before deciding what regulatory action to take.<ref name=bdmrch2005>{{cite journal |author=Professor Lader |coauthors=Professor Morgan, Professor Shepherd, Dr Paul Williams, Dr Skegg, Professor Parish, Dr Peter Tyrer, Dr Inman, Dr John Marks (Ex-Roche), Peter Harris (Roche), Tom Hurry (Wyeth) |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |date=30th of October 1980 - 3rd of April 1981 |title=Benzodiazepine Dependence Medical Research Council headquarters, Closed until 2014 - Opened 2005 |publisher=[[The National Archives]] |location=England |url=http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=6&CATID=7798554&j=1 |format=PDF }}</ref>

Controversy resulted in 2010 when the previously secret files came to light over the fact that the Medical Research Council was warned that benzodiazepines prescribed to millions of patients appeared to cause brain shrinkage similar to alcohol abuse in some patients and failed to carry out larger and more rigorous studies. ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' reported allegations that "scores" of the 1.5 million the UK public who use benzodiazepines long-term have symptoms that are consistent with brain damage. It has been described as a 'huge scandal' by Jim Dobbin, and legal experts and MPs have predicted a class action lawsuit. A solicitor said she was aware of the past failed litigation against the drug companies and the relevance the documents had to that court case and said it was strange that the documents were kept 'hidden' by the MRC.<ref name=dltbd30ya>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/drugs-linked-to-brain-damage-30-years-ago-2127504.html |title=Drugs linked to brain damage 30 years ago |author=Nina Lakhani |date=7 November 2010 |publisher=The Independent on Sunday |location=United Kingdom }}</ref>

Professor Lader, who chaired the MRC meeting, declined to speculate as to why the MRC declined to support his request to set up a unit to further research benzodiazepines and why they did not set up a special safety committee to look into these concerns. Professor Lader stated that he regrets not being more proactive on pursuing the issue, stating that he did not want to be labeled as the guy who pushed only issues with benzos. Professor Ashton also submitted proposals for grant-funded research using MRI, EEG, and cognitive testing in a ramdomised controlled trial to assess whether benzodiazepines have permanent damage to the brain, but similar to Professor Lader got turned down by the MRC.<ref name=dltbd30ya/>

The MRC spokesperson said they accept the conclusions of Professor Lader's research and said that they fund only research that meets required quality standards of scientific research, and stated that they were and continue to remain receptive to applications for research in this area. No explanation was reported for why the documents were sealed by the Public Records Act.<ref name=dltbd30ya/>

Jim Dobbin, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Involuntary Tranquilliser Addiction, stated that:<ref name=dltbd30ya/>
<blockquote>
"Many victims have lasting physical, cognitive and psychological problems even after they have withdrawn. We are seeking legal advice because we believe these documents are the bombshell they have been waiting for. The MRC must justify why there was no proper follow-up to Professor Lader's research, no safety committee, no study, nothing to further explore the results. We are talking about a huge scandal here."
</blockquote>

The legal director of Action Against Medical Accidents said urgent research must be carried out and said that, if the results of larger studies confirm professor Lader's research, the government and MRC could be faced with one of the biggest group actions for damages the courts have ever seen given the large number of people potentially affected. People who report enduring symptoms post-withdrawal such as neurological pain, headaches, cognitive impairment, and memory loss have been left in the dark as to whether these symptoms are drug-induced damage or not due to the MRC's inaction, it was reported. Professor Lader reported that the results of his research did not surprise his research group given that it was already known that alcohol could cause permanent brain changes.<ref name=dltbd30ya/>

====Class-action lawsuit====
Benzodiazepines have a unique history in that they were responsible for the largest-ever [[class-action lawsuit]] against [[drugs manufacturers|drug manufacturers]] in the United Kingdom, in the 1980s and early 1990s, involving 14,000 patients and 1,800 [[law firms]] that alleged the manufacturers knew of the dependence potential but intentionally withheld this information from doctors. At the same time, 117 general practitioners and 50 health authorities were sued by patients to recover damages for the harmful effects of [[benzodiazepine dependence|dependence]] and [[withdrawal]]. This led some doctors to require a signed consent form from their patients and to recommend that all patients be adequately warned of the risks of dependence and withdrawal before starting treatment with benzodiazepines.<ref name="King-1992">{{cite journal |author=King MB |title=Is there still a role for benzodiazepines in general practice? |journal=Br J Gen Pract |volume=42 |issue=358 |pages=202–5 |year=1992 |pmid=1389432 |pmc=1372025 }}</ref> The court case against the drug manufacturers never reached a verdict; [[legal aid]] had been withdrawn, leading to the collapse of the trial, and there were allegations that the consultant psychiatrists, the expert witnesses, had a conflict of interest.

[[Neurodevelopmental disorders]] and clinical symptoms are commonly found in babies exposed to benzodiazepines [[in utero]]. Benzodiazepine-exposed babies have a [[low birth weight]] but catch up to normal babies at an early age, but smaller head circumferences found in benzo babies persists. Other adverse effects of benzodiazepines taken during pregnancy are deviating [[neurodevelopmental]] and clinical symptoms including [[craniofacial]] anomalies, delayed development of pincer grasp, deviations in [[muscle tone]] and pattern of movements.

Concerns regarding whether benzodiazepines during pregnancy cause major malformations, in particular cleft palet have been hotly debated in the literature. A [[meta analysis]] of the data from [[cohort studies]] found no link but [[meta analysis]] of [[case control studies]] did find a significant increase in major malformations (however, the cohort studies were homogenous and the case control studies were heterogeneous, thus reducing the strength of the case control results). There have also been several reports that suggest that benzodiazepines have the potential to cause a syndrome similar to [[fetal alcohol syndrome]], but this has been disputed by a number of studies. As a result of conflicting findings use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy is controversial. The best available evidence suggests that benzodiazepines are not a major cause of [[birth defects]], i.e. major malformations or [[cleft lip]] or [[cleft palet]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dolovich LR, Addis A, Vaillancourt JM, Power JD, Koren G, Einarson TR |title=Benzodiazepine use in pregnancy and major malformations or oral cleft: meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies |journal=BMJ |volume=317 |issue=7162 |pages=839–43 |year=1998 |month=September |pmid=9748174 |pmc=31092 |doi= }}</ref>
