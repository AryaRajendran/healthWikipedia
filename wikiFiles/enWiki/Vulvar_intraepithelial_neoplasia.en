The term '''Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia''' ('''VIN''') refers to particular changes that can occur in the skin that covers the [[vulva]]. VIN is not [[cancer]], and in some women it disappears without treatment. If the changes become more severe, there is a chance that cancer might develop after many years, and so it is referred to as a [[precancerous condition]].<ref name=Macmillan>{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertypes/Vulva/Pre-cancerousconditions/Vin.aspx|title=Vulval intra-epithelial neoplasia (VIN)|publisher=Macmillan Cancer Support|accessdate=2010-06-09}}</ref>

==ISSVD Classification==
Medically speaking, the term denotes a squamous intraepithelial [[lesion]] of the [[vulva]] that shows [[dysplasia]] with varying degrees of [[atypia]]. The epithelial [[basement membrane]] is intact and the lesion is thus not invasive but has invasive potential.

The terminology of VIN evolved over several decades. In 1989<ref name="pmid2707802">{{cite journal |author=Ridley CM, Frankman O, Jones IS, ''et al.'' |title=New nomenclature for vulvar disease: International Society for the Study of Vulvar Disease |journal=Hum. Pathol. |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=495–6 |year=1989 |month=May |pmid=2707802 |doi= 10.1016/0046-8177(89)90019-1|url=}}</ref> the Committee on Terminology, [[International Society for the Study of Vulvar Disease]] (ISSVD) replaced older terminology such as vulvar [[:wikt:dystrophy|dystrophy]], [[Bowen's disease]], and Kraurosis vulvae by a new classification system for ''Epithelial Vulvar Disease'':

* Nonneoplastic epithelial disorders of vulva and mucosa:
** [[Lichen sclerosus]]
** Squamous hyperplasia
** Other dermatoses
* Mixed neoplastic and nonneoplastic disorders
* Intraepithelial neoplasia
** Squamous vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN)
*** VIN I, mildest form	
*** VIN II, intermediate
*** VIN III, most severe form including [[carcinoma in situ]] of the vulva
** Non-squamous intraepithelial neoplasia
*** [[Extramammary Paget's disease]]
*** Tumors of [[melanocyte]]s, non invasive
*Invasive disease ([[vulvar carcinoma]])

The ISSVD further revised this classification in 2004, replacing the three-grade system  with a single-grade system in which only the high-grade disease is classified as VIN. This is subdivided into: 1) usual-type VIN (including warty, basaloid and mixed subtypes)commonly associated with carcinogenic genotypes of HPV and/or HPV persistence factors such as cigarette smoking or immunocompromised states and 2) differentiated VIN, commonly associated with vulvar dermatoses such as lichen sclerosis. Differentiated VIN associated with lichen sclerosis, however, is more likely to be associated with squamous carcinoma than is usual-type VIN.

Flat lesions with basal atypia (formerly VIN I) are considered condylomas and can be treated as such.<ref>Committee Opinion No.509, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Obstet Gynecol 2011; 118:1192-4.</ref>

==Causes==
The exact cause of VIN is unknown. Studies are being done to determine the cause of VIN. The following factors have been associated with VIN: 
<br>• HPV Human Papilloma Virus) 
<br>• HSV-2 (Herpes simplex Virus - Type 2) 
<br>• Smoking 
<br>• Immunosuppression 
<br>• Chronic vulvar irritation 
<br>• Conditions such as Lichen Sclerosus

==Diagnosis==

The patient may have no symptoms, or local symptomatology including itching, burning, and pain.
The diagnosis is always based on a careful inspection and a targeted [[biopsy]].

==Prevention==
Vaccinating girls with [[HPV vaccine]] before their initial sexual contact has been claimed to reduce incidence of VIN.<ref name=VulvarCA>{{cite web|url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2008/ucm116945.htm| title = FDA Approves Expanded Uses for Gardasil to Include Preventing Certain Vulvar and Vaginal Cancers | accessdate = 2010-02-13 | date = 2008-09-12}}</ref>

==Treatment==
The treatment of VIN is local to wide excision, in case of very extensive involvement or recurrency even a simple [[vulvectomy]]. Laser therapy has also been useful for VIN.
