'''Cholesterol embolism''' (often '''cholesterol crystal embolism''' or '''atheroembolism''', sometimes '''blue toe''' or '''purple toe syndrome''' or '''trash foot''' or '''warfarin blue toe syndrome'''<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|338}}) occurs when [[cholesterol]] is released, usually from an [[atheroma|atherosclerotic plaque]], and travels along with the bloodsteam ([[embolism]]) to other places in the body, where it obstructs [[blood vessel]]s. Most commonly this causes skin symptoms (usually [[livedo reticularis]]), [[gangrene]] of the extremities and sometimes [[renal failure]]; problems with other organs may arise, depending on the site at which the cholesterol crystals enter the bloodstream.<ref name=Scolari>{{cite journal |author=Scolari F |title=The challenge of diagnosing atheroembolic renal disease: clinical features and prognostic factors |journal=Circulation |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=298–304 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17606842 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.680991 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/116/3/298 |author-separator=, |author2=Ravani P |author3=Gaggi R |display-authors=3 |last4=Santostefano |first4=M. |last5=Rollino |first5=C. |last6=Stabellini |first6=N. |last7=Colla |first7=L. |last8=Viola |first8=B.

Cholesterol embolism is treated by removing the cause and with supportive therapy; [[statin]] drugs have been found to improve the prognosis.<ref name=Scolari/>

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms experienced in cholesterol embolism depend largely on the organ involved. [[Non-specific symptom]]s often described are [[fever]], [[myalgia|muscle ache]] and [[weight loss#Unintentional weight loss|weight loss]]. Embolism to the legs causes a mottled appearance and purple discoloration of the [[toe]]s, small [[infarct]]s and areas of [[gangrene]] due to [[necrosis|tissue death]] that usually appear black, and areas of the skin that assume a marbled pattern known as ''[[Livedoid vasculitis|livedo reticularis]]''.<ref name=Modi/> The pain is usually severe and requires opiates. If the ulcerated plaque is below the renal arteries the manifestations appear in both lower extremities. Very rarely the ulcerated plaque is below the aortic bifurcation and those cases the changes occur only in one lower extremity.

Kidney involvement leads to the symptoms of renal failure, which are non-specific but usually cause [[nausea]], reduced [[appetite]] ([[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]]), raised [[blood pressure]] (hypertension), and occasionally the various symptoms of [[electrolyte disturbance]] such as an [[cardiac arrhythmia|irregular heartbeat]]. Some patients report [[hematuria]] (bloody urine) but this may only be detectable on microscopic examination of the urine. Increased amounts of [[protein]] in the urine may cause [[edema]] (swelling) of the skin (a combination of symptoms known as [[nephrotic syndrome]]).<ref name=Modi/>

If emboli have spread to the [[digestive tract]], reduced appetite, nausea and vomiting may occur, as well as nonspecific [[abdominal pain]], [[gastrointestinal hemorrhage]] (vomiting blood, or [[hematochezia|admixture of blood in the stool]]), and occasionally [[acute pancreatitis]] (inflammation of the [[pancreas]]).<ref name=Modi/>

Both the [[central nervous system]] (brain and [[spinal cord]]) and the [[peripheral nervous system]] may be involved. Emboli to the brain may cause [[stroke]]-like episodes, [[headache]] and episodes of loss of vision in one eye (known as [[amaurosis fugax]]).<ref name=Modi/> Emboli to the eye can be seen by [[ophthalmoscopy]] and are known as [[Hollenhorst plaque|plaques of Hollenhorst]].<ref name=Schwarcz>{{cite journal| author=Schwarcz TH|title=Hollenhorst plaques: retinal manifestations and the role of carotid endarterectomy| journal=J Vasc Surg. |volume=11|issue=5|pages=635–641|pmid=2335833|month=May| doi=10.1067/mva.1990.19748| year=1990| author-separator=,| author2=Eton D| author3=Ellenby MI| author4=Stelmack T| author5=McMahon TT| author6=Mulder S| author7=Meyer JP| author8=Eldrup-Jorgensen J| author9=Durham JR| display-authors=10}}</ref> Emboli to the spinal cord may cause [[paraparesis]] (decreased power in the legs) or [[cauda equina syndrome]], a group of symptoms due to loss of function of the distal part of the spinal cord - loss of control over the [[bladder]], [[rectum]] and skin sensation around the anus.<ref name=Modi/> If the blood supply to a single nerve is interrupted by an embolus, the result is loss of function in the muscles supplied by that nerve; this phenomenon is called a ''[[mononeuropathy]]''.<ref name=Modi/>

==Causes==
It is relatively unusual (25% of the total number of cases) for cholesterol emboli to occur spontaneously; this usually happens in people with severe [[atherosclerosis]] of the large arteries such as the [[aorta]]. In the other 75% it is a complication of medical procedures involving the blood vessels, such as [[vascular surgery]] or [[angiography]]. In [[coronary catheterization]], for instance, the incidence is 1.4%.<ref name=Fukumoto>{{cite journal |author=Fukumoto Y, Tsutsui H, Tsuchihashi M, Masumoto A, Takeshita A |title=The incidence and risk factors of cholesterol embolization syndrome, a complication of cardiac catheterization: a prospective study |journal=J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=211–6 |year=2003 |month=July |pmid=12875753 |doi=10.1016/S0735-1097(03)00579-5 | url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0735109703005795}}</ref> Furthermore, cholesterol embolism may develop after the commencement of [[anticoagulant]]s or [[thrombolysis|thrombolytic]] medication that decrease blood clotting or dissolve blood clots, respectively. They probably lead to cholesterol emboli by removing blood clots that cover up a damaged atherosclerotic plaque; cholesterol-rich debris can then enter the bloodsteam.<ref name=Modi/>

==Diagnosis==

===Differential diagnosis===
Findings on general investigations (such as [[blood test]]s) are not specific for cholesterol embolism, which makes diagnosis difficult. The main problem is the distinction between cholesterol embolism and [[vasculitis]] (inflammation of the small blood vessels), which may cause very similar symptoms - especially the skin findings and the kidney dysfunction.<ref name=Modi/> Worsening kidney function after an angiogram may also be attributed to kidney damage by substances used during the procedure ([[Radiocontrast#Contrast-induced nephropathy|contrast nephropathy]]). Other causes that may lead to similar symptoms include [[acute tubular necrosis|ischemic renal failure]] (kidney dysfunction due to an interrupted blood supply), a group of diseases known as [[microangiopathic hemolytic anemia|thrombotic microangiopathies]] and [[endocarditis]] (infection of the [[heart valve]]s with small clumps of infected tissue embolizing through the body).<ref name=Modi/>

===Blood and urine===
Tests for [[inflammation]] ([[C-reactive protein]] and the [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]]) are typically elevated, and abnormal [[liver enzyme]]s may be seen.<ref name=Modi/> If the kidneys are involved, tests of [[renal function]] (such as [[urea]] and [[creatinine]]) are elevated.<ref name=Modi/> The [[complete blood count]] may show particularly high numbers of a type of [[white blood cell]] known as ''[[eosinophil]]s'' (more than 0.5 billion per liter); this occurs in only 60-80% of cases, so normal eosinophil counts do not rule out the diagnosis.<ref name=Modi/><ref name=Fukumoto/> Examination of the urine may show [[red blood cell]]s (occasionally in [[urinary casts|casts]] as seen under the microscope) and increased levels of protein; in a third of the cases with kidney involvement, eosinophils can also be detected in the urine.<ref name=Modi/> If vasculitis is suspected, [[Complement system|complement]] levels may be determined as reduced levels are often encountered in vasculitis; complement is a group of proteins that forms part of the innate [[immune system]]. Complement levels are frequently reduced in cholesterol embolism, limiting the use of this test in the distinction between vasculitis and cholesterol embolism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cosio FG, Zager RA, Sharma HM |title=Atheroembolic renal disease causes hypocomplementaemia |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8447 |pages=118–21 |year=1985 |month=July |pmid=2862317 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(85)90225-9}}</ref>

===Tissue diagnosis===
The microscopic examination of tissue ([[histology]]) gives the definitive diagnosis.  The diagnostic [[histopathology|histopathologic]] finding is intravascular cholesterol crystals, which are seen as cholesterol clefts in routinely processed tissue (embedded in [[paraffin wax]]).<ref>{{cite book |author= Mills, Stacey E; Carter, Darryl; Greenson, Joel K; Reuter, Victor E; Stoler, Mark H   |title=Sternberg's Diagnostic Surgical Pathology |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location= |year=2009 |pages= 1735–6 |edition=5th |isbn=978-0-7817-7942-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> The cholesterol crystals may be associated with [[macrophage]]s, including [[giant cell]]s, and [[eosinophil]]s.  

The [[sensitivity (test)|sensitivity]] of small core biopsies is modest, due to [[sampling error]], as the process is often patchy.  Affected organs show the characteristic histologic changes in 50-75% of the clinically diagnosed cases.<ref name=Modi/><ref name=Fukumoto/> Non-specific tissue findings suggestive of a cholesterol embolization include [[ischemia|ischemic changes]], [[necrosis]] and unstable-appearing complex [[atherosclerotic plaques]] (that are cholesterol-laden and have a thin fibrous cap).  While biopsy findings may not be diagnostic, they have significant value, as they help exclude alternate diagnoses, e.g. [[vasculitis]], that often cannot be made confidently based on clinical criteria.

==Treatment==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Treatment of an episode of cholesterol emboli is generally symptomatic, i.e. it deals with the symptoms and complications but cannot reverse the phenomenon itself.<ref name=Fukumoto/> In kidney failure resulting from cholesterol crystal emboli, [[statin]]s (medication that reduces cholesterol levels) have been shown to halve the risk of requiring [[hemodialysis]].<ref name=Scolari/>

==History==
The phenomenon of embolisation of cholesterol was first recognized by the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[pathologist]] Dr. [[Peter Ludvig Panum]] and published in 1862.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Panum PL | title=Experimentelle Beitrage zur Lehre von der Embolie | language=German | journal=Virchows Arch Pathol Anat Physiol | year=1862 | volume=25 | pages=308–310 | doi=10.1007/BF01879803 | issue=5–6}}</ref> Further evidence that eroded atheroma was the source of emboli came from American [[pathology|pathologist]] Dr. Curtis M. Flory, who in 1945 reported the phenomenon in 3.4% of a large [[autopsy]] series of older individuals with severe atherosclerosis of the [[aorta]].<ref name=Modi/><ref>{{cite journal | author=Flory CM | title=Arterial occlusions produced by emboli from eroded aortic atheromatous plaques | journal=Am J Pathol | year= 1945 | volume=21 | pages=549–565 | pmid=19970827 | issue=3 | pmc=1934118}}</ref>
