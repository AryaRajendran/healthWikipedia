'''Pyloric stenosis''' (or '''infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis or pylorostenosis''')<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hulka F, Campbell TJ, Campbell JR, Harrison MW |title=Evolution in the recognition of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis |journal=Pediatrics |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=E9 |year=1997 |pmid=9233980 |doi= 10.1542/peds.100.2.e9|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/100/2/e9}}</ref> is a condition that causes severe projectile non-bilious vomiting in the first few months of life.  There is narrowing ([[stenosis]]) of the opening from the stomach to the first part of the [[small intestine]] known as the [[duodenum]], due to enlargement ([[hypertrophy]]) of the muscle surrounding this opening (the [[pylorus]], meaning "gate"), which spasms when the stomach empties. This hypertrophy is felt classically as an olive-shaped mass in the [[Epigastric|middle upper]] part or [[Right upper quadrant (abdomen)|right upper quadrant]] of the infant's abdomen.  In pyloric stenosis, it is uncertain whether there is a real congenital narrowing or whether there is a functional hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle.  This condition typically develops in male babies in the first 2–6 weeks of life.

Pyloric stenosis also occurs in adults where the cause is usually a narrowed pylorus due to scarring from chronic peptic ulceration. This is a different condition from the infantile form.

==Signs and symptoms==
Babies with this condition usually present any time in the first weeks to months of life with progressively worsening [[vomiting]].  The vomiting is often described as non-bile stained ("non bilious") and "projectile vomiting", because it is more forceful than the usual spittiness ([[gastroesophageal reflux]]) seen at this age.  Some infants present with poor feeding and weight loss but others demonstrate normal weight gain. Dehydration may occur which causes a baby to cry without having tears and to produce less wet or dirty diapers due to not urinating for hours or for a few days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/pyloric-stenosis/DS00815/DSECTION=symptoms |title=Pyloric stenosis: Symptoms |publisher=MayoClinic.com |date=2010-08-21 |accessdate=2012-02-21}}</ref> Constant hunger, belching, and [[Baby colic|colic]] are other possible signs that the baby is unable to eat properly.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is via a careful history and physical examination, often supplemented by radiographic studies.  There should be suspicion for pyloric stenosis in any young infant with severe vomiting.  On exam, [[palpation]] of the abdomen may reveal a mass in the [[epigastrium]].  This mass, which consists of the enlarged pylorus, is referred to as the 'olive', and is sometimes evident after the infant is given formula to drink.  It is an elusive diagnostic skill requiring much patience and experience.  There are often palpable (or even visible) [[peristalsis|peristaltic]] waves due to the stomach trying to force its contents past the narrowed pyloric outlet. 

Most cases of pyloric stenosis are diagnosed/confirmed with [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]], if available, showing the thickened pylorus.  Although somewhat less useful, an [[upper GI series]] (x-rays taken after the baby drinks a special [[contrast agent]]) can be diagnostic by showing the narrowed pyloric outlet filled with a thin stream of contrast material; a "[[string sign]]" or the "railroad track sign".  For either type of study, there are specific measurement criteria used to identify the abnormal results.  Plain x-rays of the abdomen are not useful, except when needed to rule out other problems.

Blood tests will reveal [[hypokalemia|hypokalemic]], [[hypochloremia|hypochloremic]] [[metabolic alkalosis]] due to loss of [[gastric acid]] (which contain hydrochloric acid and potassium) via persistent vomiting; these findings can be seen with severe vomiting from any cause. The potassium is decreased further by the body's release of aldosterone, in an attempt to compensate for the [[Hypovolemia|hypovolaemia]] due to the severe vomiting.

==Pathophysiology==
The gastric outlet obstruction due to the hypertrophic pylorus impairs emptying of gastric contents into the [[duodenum]]. As a consequence, all ingested food and gastric secretions can only exit via vomiting, which can be of a projectile nature. The exact cause of the hypertrophy remains unknown.<ref name=AskewOverview>{{cite journal|last=Askew|first=Nathan|title=An overview of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.|journal=Paediatric nursing|year=2010|month=October|volume=22|issue=8|pages=27–30|pmid=21066945|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/54358896/overview-infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis|accessdate=30 August 2012}}</ref>

The vomited material does not contain [[bile]] because the pyloric obstruction prevents entry of duodenal contents (containing bile) into the stomach.

This results in loss of gastric acid ([[hydrochloric acid]]). The [[chloride]] loss results in [[hypochloremia]] which impairs the kidney's ability to excrete bicarbonate. This is the significant factor that prevents correction of the alkalosis.<ref name="Acidbase">Kerry Brandis, [http://www.anaesthesiamcq.com/AcidBaseBook/ab7_3.php Acid-Base Physiology]. Retrieved December 31, 2006.</ref>

A secondary [[hyperaldosteronism]] develops due to the [[hypovolemia]]. The high [[aldosterone]] levels causes the kidneys to avidly retain [[Sodium|Na<sup>+</sup>]] (to correct the intravascular [[volume depletion]]), and excrete increased amounts of [[Potassium|K<sup>+</sup>]] into the urine (resulting in [[hypokalaemia]]).

The body's compensatory response to the metabolic alkalosis is hypoventilation resulting in an elevated arterial pCO<sub>2</sub>.

Infantile pyloric stenosis is typically managed with surgery;<ref name=AskewOverview /> very few cases are mild enough to be treated medically.

The danger of pyloric stenosis comes from the dehydration and electrolyte disturbance rather than the underlying problem itself. Therefore, the baby must be initially stabilized by correcting the dehydration and hypochloremic alkalosis with IV fluids. This can usually be accomplished in about 24–48 hours. 

Intravenous and oral [[atropine]] may be used to treat pyloric stenosis. It has a success rate of 85-89% compared to nearly 100% for pyloromyotomy, however it requires prolonged hospitalization, skilled nursing and careful follow up during treatment.<ref name="pmid17210480">{{cite journal |author=Aspelund G, Langer JC |title=Current management of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis |journal=Semin. Pediatr. Surg. |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=27–33 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17210480 |doi=10.1053/j.sempedsurg.2006.10.004 |url=}}</ref> It might be an alternative to surgery in children who have contraindications for anesthesia or surgery.

===Surgery===
The definitive treatment of pyloric stenosis is with surgical [[pyloromyotomy]] known as Ramstedt's procedure (dividing the [[muscle]] of the [[pylorus]] to open up the gastric outlet).  This is a relatively straightforward surgery that can possibly be done through a single incision (usually 3–4&nbsp;cm long) or [[Laparoscopic surgery|laparoscopically]] (through several tiny incisions), depending on the surgeon's experience and preference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/Surgery/ThoracicSurgery/12497 |title=Medical News:Laparoscopic Repair of Pediatric Pyloric Stenosis May Speed Recovery - in Surgery, Thoracic Surgery from |publisher=MedPage Today |date=2009-01-16 |accessdate=2012-02-21}}</ref>

Today, the laparoscopic technique has largely supplanted the traditional open repairs which involved either a tiny circular incision around the navel or the Ramstedt procedure.  Compared to the older open techniques, the complication rate is equivalent, except for a markedly lower risk of wound infection.<ref name="pmid19635317">{{cite journal |author=Sola JE, Neville HL |title=Laparoscopic vs open pyloromyotomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=J. Pediatr. Surg. |volume=44 |issue=8 |pages=1631–7 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19635317 |doi=10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2009.04.001 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-3468(09)00313-3}}</ref>  This is now considered the standard of care at the majority of Children Hospitals across the US, although some surgeons still perform the open technique. Following repair, the small 3mm incisions are hard to see.

The vertical incision, pictured and listed above, is no longer usually required. Though many incisions have been horizontal in the past years.

Once the stomach can empty into the [[duodenum]], feeding can commence. Some vomiting may be expected during the first days after surgery as the gastro-intestinal tract settles. Very occasionally the [[myotomy]] was incomplete and projectile vomiting continues, requiring repeat surgery. But the condition generally has no long term side-effects or impact on the child's future.

==Epidemiology==
Males are more commonly affected than females, with firstborn males affected about four times as often, and there is a [[genetic predisposition]] for the disease.<ref name="kh">{{cite web |url= http://www.kidshealth.org/parent/medical/digestive/pyloric_stenosis.html |title= Pyloric Stenosis |publisher= The Nemours Foundation |month= November | year= 2007 |last= Dowshen |first= Steven |accessdate= 2007-12-30 }}</ref> It is commonly associated with people of Jewish ancestry, and has multifactorial inheritance patterns.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fried K, Aviv S, Nisenbaum C |title=Probable autosomal dominant infantile pyloric stenosis in a large kindred |journal=Clin. Genet. |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=328–30 |year=1981 |month=November |pmid=7333028 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.1981.tb01043.x}}</ref> Pyloric stenosis is more common in Caucasians than Hispanics, Blacks, or Asians. The incidence is 2.4 per 1000 live births in Caucasians, 1.8 in Hispanics, 0.7 in Blacks, and 0.6 in Asians. It is also less common amongst children of mixed race parents.<ref>{{EMedicine|EMERG|397|Pediatrics, Pyloric Stenosis}}</ref>  Caucasian babies with [[blood type]] B or O are more likely than other types to be affected.<ref name="kh"/>

Infants exposed to [[erythromycin]] are at increased risk for developing hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, especially when the drug is taken around two weeks of life.<ref name=Erythromycin>{{cite journal|last=Maheshwai|first=Nitin|title=Are young infants treated with erythromycin at risk for developing hypertrophic pyloric stenosis?|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|year=2007|month=March|volume=92|issue=3|pages=271–3|pmid=17337692|url=http://adc.bmj.com/content/92/3/271|accessdate=30 August 2012|doi=10.1136/adc.2006.110007|pmc=2083424}}</ref>
