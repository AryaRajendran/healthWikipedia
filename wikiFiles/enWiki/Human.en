This mental capability, combined with an adaptation to [[bipedal]] locomotion that frees the hands for manipulating objects, has allowed humans to make far greater use of [[tool]]s than any other species.

The scientific study of humans is the discipline of [[anthropology]].

Humans are uniquely adept at utilizing systems of symbolic communication such as language and art for self-expression, the exchange of ideas, and organization. Humans create complex [[social structure]]s composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from [[family|families]] and [[kinship]] networks to [[state (polity)|states]]. [[Social interaction]]s between humans have established an extremely wide variety of values, [[norm (sociology)|social norms]], and [[ritual]]s, which together form the basis of human society. Humans are noted for their desire to understand and influence their environment, seeking to explain and manipulate phenomena through [[science]], [[philosophy]], [[mythology]], and [[religion]].

Humans began to practice sedentary agriculture about 12,000 years ago, domesticating plants and animals which allowed for the growth of [[civilization]]. Humans subsequently established various forms of government, religion, and culture around the world, unifying people within a region and leading to the development of states and empires. The rapid advancement of scientific and medical understanding in the 19th and 20th centuries led to the development of fuel-driven technologies and improved health, causing the human population to rise exponentially.

==Etymology and definition==
{{Further|Man (word)|List of alternative names for the human species}}
With the discovery and study of fossil ancestors of modern humans the meaning of the word "human" changed, as the previously clear boundary between human and ape blurred, now encompassing multiple [[species]]. Today in scientific usage "human" may refer to any member of the genus  ''Homo''. Furthermore within ''Homo sapiens'', there is a distinction between ''[[Anatomically modern humans|anatomically modern Homo sapiens]]'' and ''[[Archaic Homo sapiens]]'', the earliest fossil members of the species. Sometimes groups such as the [[Neanderthals]] are classified as a [[subspecies]] of ''Homo sapiens'' - ''Homo sapiens neanderthalensis''. However, in everyday usage, and in this article, the word "human" generally refers to the only extant species of the genus - anatomically and behaviorally modern '' Homo sapiens''. The open question about possible extinct subspecies will be briefly covered. Fossil humans are covered in the article "[[Homo]]", and in the articles about individual species of the genus.

The English adjective ''human'' is a [[Middle English]]  [[loanword]] from [[Old French]] ''{{lang|fro|humain}}'', ultimately from [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|hūmānus}}'', the adjective form of ''{{lang|la|homō}}'' "man". The word's use as a noun (with a plural: ''humans'') dates to the 16th century.<ref>[[OED]], [[sub verbo|s.v.]] "human".</ref> The native English term ''[[Man (word)|man]]'' can refer to the species generally (a synonym for ''mankind''), and could formerly refer to specific individuals of either sex. The latter use is now obsolete.<ref>The [[OED]]
considers ''obsolete'' the sense "a designation applied equally to particular individuals of either sex", citing a 1597 source as the most recent (''The Lord had but one paire of men in Paradise.'') while it continues to endorse the sense "as a general or indefinite designation" as current in English.</ref> Generic uses of the term "man" are declining, in favor of reserving it for referring specifically to adult males. The word is from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''{{lang|gem|*[[mannaz]]}}'', from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) root ''{{PIE|*man-}}''.

The species [[binomial]] ''Homo sapiens'' was coined by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his 18th century work ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', and he himself is the [[lectotype]] specimen.<ref>{{cite jstor|4065043}}</ref> The [[Name of a biological genus|generic name]] ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' is a learned 18th century derivation from Latin ''{{lang|la|homō}}'' "man", ultimately "earthly being" ([[Old Latin]] ''{{lang|la|hemō}}'', a [[cognate]] to Old English ''{{lang|ang|guma}}'' "man", from [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''{{PIE|*dʰǵʰ<sub>e</sub>mon-}}'', meaning 'earth' or 'ground').<ref>[[IEW|Porkorny (1959)]] s.v. "g'hðem" pp. 414–416; "Homo." Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Random House, Inc. 23 Sep. 2008. {{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Homo |publisher=Dictionary.com |title=Homo }}</ref> The species-name ''sapiens'' means "wise" or "sapient". Note that the Latin word ''homo'' refers to humans of either gender, and that ''sapiens'' is the singular form (there is no word ''sapien'').

==History==
===Evolution===
{{Main|Human evolution}}
{{Further|Anthropology|Homo (genus)|Timeline of human evolution}}

Scientific study of [[human evolution]] studies the development of the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'', reconstructing the evolutionary divergence of the human lineage from other [[hominini|hominins]] (shared ancestors of humans and [[chimpanzees]]), [[Hominidae|hominids]] (great apes) and [[primates]]. Modern humans are defined as belonging to the [[species]] ''Homo sapiens'', specifically to the single extant [[subspecies]] ''Homo sapiens sapiens''.

There is little fossil evidence for the divergence of the gorilla, chimpanzee and hominin lineages.<ref>Begun, David R. 2010. Miocene Hominids and the Origins of the African Apes and Humans.

Each of these have been argued to be a [[bipedal]] ancestor of later hominins, but in each cases the claims have been contested. It is also possible that either of these species are ancestors of another branch of African apes, or that they represent a shared ancestor between hominins and other apes. The question of the relation between these early fossil species and the hominin lineage is still to be resolved. From these early species the [[Australopithecines]] arose around {{mya|4}} diverged into  [[Robust australopithecines|robust]] (also called [[Paranthropus]]) and [[gracile australopithecines|gracile]] branches, one of which (possibly ''[[Australopithecus garhi|A. garhi]]'') went on to become ancestors of the genus ''Homo''.

The earliest members of the genus ''Homo'' are ''[[Homo habilis]]'' which evolved around {{Mya|2.3}}. ''Homo habilis'' is the first species for which we have positive evidence of use of [[stone tools]]. The brains of these early hominins were about the same size as that of a chimpanzee, and their main adaptation was bipedalism as an adaptation to terrestrial living.  During the next million years a process of [[encephalization]] began, and with the arrival of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' in the fossil record, cranial capacity had doubled. ''Homo erectus'' were the first of the hominina to leave Africa, and these species spread through Africa, Asia, and Europe between {{Mya|1.3|1.8}}. One population of ''H. erectus'', also sometimes classified as a separate species [[Homo ergaster]], stayed in Africa and evolved into ''Homo sapiens''. It is believed that these species were the first to use fire and complex tools. The earliest transitional fossils between ''H. ergaster/erectus'' and [[archaic humans]] are from Africa such as ''[[Homo rhodesiensis]]'', but seemingly transitional forms are also found at [[Dmanisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. These descendants of African ''H. erectus'' spread through Eurasia from ca. 500,000 years ago evolving into ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'', ''[[Homo heidelbergensis|H. heidelbergensis]]'' and ''[[Homo neanderthalensis|H. neanderthalensis]]''.  The earliest fossils of [[anatomically modern humans]] are from the [[Middle Paleolithic]], about 200,000 years ago such as the [[Omo remains]] of Ethiopia and the fossils of Herto sometimes classified as ''[[Homo sapiens idaltu]]''.<ref name="White03">{{Citation |last=White |first=Tim D. |authorlink=Tim White (anthropologist) |last2=Asfaw |first2=B. |last3=DeGusta |first3=D. |last4=Gilbert |first4=H. |last5=Richards |first5=G.

====Anatomical adaptations====
[[File:Homo habilis-2.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Reconstruction of ''Homo habilis'', the first human ancestor to use stone tools]]
Human evolution is characterized by a number of [[morphology (biology)|morphological]], [[human development (biology)|developmental]], [[human physiology|physiological]], and [[Human behavior|behavioral]] changes that have taken place since the split between the [[chimpanzee-human last common ancestor|last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees]]. The most significant of these adaptations are 1. bipedalism, 2. increased brain size, 3. lengthened [[ontogeny]] (gestation and infancy), 4. decreased [[sexual dimorphism]]. The relationship between all these changes is the subject of ongoing debate.<ref name=Boyd2003>{{cite book |author=Boyd, Robert; Silk, Joan B. |year=2003 |title=How Humans Evolved |location=New York, New York |publisher=Norton |isbn=0-393-97854-0}}</ref> Other significant morphological changes included the evolution of a [[Thumb#Grips|power and precision grip]], a change first occurring in ''H. erectus''.<ref name=Brues1965>{{cite journal |author=Brues, Alice M.; Snow, Clyde C. |title=Physical Anthropology |journal=Biennial Review of Anthropology |year=1965 |volume=4 |pages=1–39 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9WemAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1}}</ref>

[[Bipedal]]ism is the basic adaption of the ''Hominin'' line, and it is considered the main cause behind a suite of [[Human skeletal changes due to bipedalism|skeletal changes]] shared by all bipedal hominins. The earliest bipedal [[Hominini|Hominin]] is considered to be either ''[[Sahelanthropus]]''<ref name=Brunet2002>{{cite journal |author=Brunet, M.; Guy, F.; Pilbeam, D.; Mackaye, H.; Likius, A.; Ahounta, D.; Beauvilain, A.; Blondel, C.; Bocherens, H.; Boisserie, J.; De Bonis, L.; Coppens, Y.; Dejax, J.; Denys, C.; Duringer, P.; Eisenmann, V.; Fanone, G.; Fronty, P.; Geraads, D.; Lehmann, T.; Lihoreau, F.; Louchart, A.; Mahamat, A.; Merceron, G.; Mouchelin, G.; Otero, O.; Pelaez Campomanes, P.; Ponce De Leon, M.; Rage, J.; Sapanet, M.; Schuster, M.; Sudre, J.; Tassy, P.; Valentin, X.; Vignaud, P.; Viriot, L.; Zazzo, A.; Zollikofer, C. |title=A new hominid from the Upper Miocene of Chad, Central Africa |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v418/n6894/full/nature00879.html |journal=Nature |volume=418 |issue=6894 |pages=145–151 |year=2002 |pmid=12110880 |doi=10.1038/nature00879}}</ref> or ''[[Orrorin]]'', with [[Ardipithecus]], a full bipedal, coming somewhat later. The knuckle walkers, the [[gorilla]] and [[chimpanzee]], diverged around the same time, and either Sahelanthropus or Orrorin may be humans' last shared ancestor with those animals. The early bipedals eventually evolved into the ''[[Australopithecines]]'' and later the genus ''[[Homo]]''. There are several theories of the adaptational value of bipedalism. It is possible that bipedalism was favored because it freed up the hands for reaching and carrying food, because it saved energy during locomotion, because it enabled long distance running and hunting, or as a strategy for avoiding hyperthermia by reducing the surface exposed to direct sun.

The human species developed a much larger brain than that of other primates – typically 1,330 [[cubic centimetres|cc]] in modern humans, over twice the size of that of a chimpanzee or gorilla.<ref name="Schoeneman">{{cite journal|title=Evolution of the Size and Functional Areas of the Human Brain|author= P. Thomas Schoenemann|journal=Annu. Rev. Anthropol|year= 2006|volume=35|pages=379–406}}</ref> The pattern of [[encephalization]] started with ''Homo habilis'' which at approximately 600 cc had a brain slightly larger than chimpanzees, and continued with ''Homo erectus'' (800-1100 cc), and reached a maximum in Neanderthals with an average size of 1200-1900cc, larger even than ''Homo sapiens''. The pattern of human postnatal [[neural development|brain growth]] differs from that of other apes ([[heterochrony]]), and allows for extended periods of [[Observational learning|social learning]] and [[language acquisition]] in juvenile humans.

The reduced degree of sexual dimorphism is primarily visible in the reduction of the male [[canine tooth]] relative to other ape species (except [[gibbons]]). Another important physiological change related to sexuality in humans was the evolution of [[hidden estrus]]. Humans are the only ape in which the female is fertile year round, and in which no special signals of fertility are produced by the body (such as [[genital swelling]] during estrus). Nonetheless humans retain a degree of sexual dimorphism in the distribution of body hair and subcutaneous fat, and in the overall size, males being around 25% larger than females. These changes taken together have been interpreted as a result of an increased emphasis on [[pair bonding]] as a possible solution to the requirement for increased parental investment due to the prolonged infancy of offspring.

===Transition to civilization===
{{Main|Neolithic Revolution|Cradle of Civilization}}
{{Further|History of the world}}
[[File:Farmer plowing.jpg|thumb|The rise of [[agriculture]], and [[domestication]] of animals, led to stable [[human settlements]].]]

Until c.&nbsp;10,000 years ago, humans lived as [[hunter-gatherer]]s. They generally lived in small nomadic groups known as [[band societies]]. The advent of agriculture prompted the [[Neolithic Revolution]], when access to food surplus led to the formation of permanent [[human settlement]]s, the [[domestication]] of animals and the [[Chalcolithic|use of metal tools]] for the first time in history. Agriculture encouraged [[trade]] and cooperation, and led to complex society. Because of the significance of this date for human society, it is the epoch of the [[Holocene calendar]] or Human Era.

About 6,000 years ago, the first proto-states developed in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]]'s [[Nile Valley]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]]. Military forces were formed for protection, and government bureaucracies for administration. States cooperated and competed for resources, in some cases waging wars. Around 2,000–3,000 years ago, some states, such as [[Persian Empire|Persia]], [[History of India|India]], [[China]], [[Roman Empire|Rome]], and [[Macedonian Empire|Greece]], developed through conquest into the first expansive [[empire]]s. [[Ancient Greece]] was the seminal civilization that laid the foundations of [[Western culture]], being the birthplace of Western [[philosophy]], [[democracy]], major scientific and mathematical advances, the [[Olympic Games]], [[Western literature]] and [[historiography]], as well as Western [[drama]], including both [[tragedy]] and [[comedy]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Greek Ways: How the Greeks Created Western Civilization |last=Thornton |first=Bruce |year=2002 |publisher=Encounter Books |location=San Francisco, CA, USA |isbn=1-893554-57-0 |pages=1–14 |page=198 |url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=fa6swJv64xkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Greek+Ways:+How+the+Greeks+Created+Western+Civilization&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5O1xT__KCImGhQfgztC4AQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Greek%20Ways%3A%20How%20the%20Greeks%20Created%20Western%20Civilization&f=false }}</ref> Influential religions, such as [[Judaism]], originating in [[West Asia]], and [[Hinduism]], originating in South Asia, also rose to prominence at this time.

The late [[Middle Ages]] saw the rise of revolutionary ideas and technologies. In China, an advanced and urbanized society promoted innovations and sciences, such as [[history of printing in East Asia|printing]] and [[seed drill]]ing. In India, major advancements were made in mathematics, philosophy, religion and [[metallurgy]]. The [[Islamic Golden Age]] saw major scientific advancements in [[Islam|Muslim]] empires. In Europe, the rediscovery of [[classical antiquity|classical]] learning and inventions such as the [[printing press]] led to the [[Renaissance]] in the 14th and 15th centuries. Over the next 500&nbsp;years, [[Age of Discovery|exploration]] and [[colonialism]] brought great parts of the world under European control, leading to later struggles for independence. The [[Scientific Revolution]] in the 17th century and the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 18th–19th centuries promoted major innovations in transport, such as the railway and automobile; [[energy development]], such as coal and electricity; and government, such as [[representative democracy]] and [[Communism]].

With the advent of the [[Information Age]] at the end of the 20th century, modern humans live in a world that has become increasingly [[globalization|globalized]] and interconnected. As of 2010, almost 2&nbsp;billion humans are able to communicate with each other via the [[Internet]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm |title=Internet Usage Statistics - The Internet Big Picture |publisher=internetworldstats.com/ |accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref> and 3.3 billion by [[mobile phone]] subscriptions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20081217165448/http://investing.reuters.co.uk/news/articleinvesting.aspx?type=media&storyID=nL29172095 |title=Reuters homepage |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref>

Although interconnection between humans has encouraged the growth of [[science]], [[art]], [[discussion]], and [[technology]], it has also led to culture clashes and the development and use of [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Human civilization has led to [[Environmental degradation|environmental destruction]] and [[pollution]] significantly contributing to the ongoing [[mass extinction]] of other forms of life called the [[holocene extinction event]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pimm S, Raven P, Peterson A, Sekercioglu CH, Ehrlich PR |title=Human impacts on the rates of recent, present, and future bird extinctions |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0604181103 |journal=Proc.

==Habitat and population==
{{Further|Human migration|Demography|World population}}
[[File:Earthlights dmsp small.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The [[Earth]], as seen from [[space]] in October 2000, showing the extent of human occupation of the planet. The bright lights are the most densely inhabited areas.]]

Early human settlements were dependent on proximity to [[water resources|water]] and, depending on the [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], other [[natural resources]] used for [[subsistence]], such as populations of animal prey for [[hunting]] and [[arable land]] for growing crops and grazing [[livestock]]. But humans have a great capacity for altering their [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] by means of technology, through [[irrigation]], [[urban planning]], [[construction]], [[transport]], [[manufacturing]] goods, [[deforestation]] and [[desertification]]. Deliberate habitat alteration is often done with the goals of increasing material [[wealth]], increasing [[thermal comfort]], improving the amount of food available, improving [[aesthetics]], or improving ease of access to resources or other human settlements. With the advent of large-scale trade and [[transport infrastructure]], proximity to these resources has become unnecessary, and in many places, these factors are no longer a driving force behind the growth and decline of a population. Nonetheless, the manner in which a habitat is altered is often a major determinant in population change.

Technology has allowed humans to colonize all of the continents and adapt to virtually all climates. Within the last century, humans have explored [[Antarctica]], the ocean depths, and [[outer space]], although large-scale colonization of these environments is not yet feasible. With a population of over seven billion, humans are among the most numerous of the large mammals. Most humans (61%) live in Asia. The remainder live in the Americas (14%), Africa (14%), Europe (11%), and Oceania (0.5%).{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Human habitation within [[closed ecological system]]s in hostile environments, such as Antarctica and outer space, is expensive, typically limited in duration, and restricted to scientific, military, or industrial expeditions. Life in space has been very sporadic, with no more than thirteen humans in space at any given time.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nancy Atkinson |url=http://www.universetoday.com/27924/soyuz-rockets-to-space-13-humans-now-in-orbit/ |title=Soyuz Rockets to Space; 13 Humans Now in Orbit |publisher=Universetoday.com |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> Between 1969 and 1972, two humans at a time spent brief intervals on the [[exploration of the Moon|Moon]].

{{Further|Human physical appearance|Anatomically modern humans|Sex differences in humans}}
Human body types vary substantially. Although body size is largely determined by [[gene]]s, it is also significantly influenced by environmental factors such as [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[exercise]]. The average [[human height|height]] of an adult human is {{height|m=1.4|precision=0}} to {{height|m=1.9|precision=0}} tall, although this varies significantly from place to place and depending on ethnic origin.<ref>{{cite journal | author = de Beer H | title = Observations on the history of Dutch physical stature from the late-Middle Ages to the present | journal = Econ Hum Biol | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–55 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15463992 | doi = 10.1016/j.ehb.2003.11.001}}</ref> The average [[human weight|mass]] of an adult human is 54–64&nbsp;kg (120–140&nbsp;lbs) for females and 76–83&nbsp;kg (168–183&nbsp;lbs) for males.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.articleworld.org/index.php/Human_weight |title=Human weight|publisher=Articleworld.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> Weight can also vary greatly (e.g. [[obesity]]).

Although humans appear hairless compared to other primates, with notable [[hair]] growth occurring chiefly on the top of the head, underarms and pubic area, the average human has more [[hair follicles]] on his or her body than the average chimpanzee. The main distinction is that human hairs are shorter, finer, and less heavily pigmented than the average chimpanzee's, thus making them harder to see.<ref>''Why Humans and Their Fur Parted Way'' by Nicholas Wade, ''New York Times'', August 19, 2003.</ref> Humans, like other primates, have [[sweat glands]], better enabling them to conserve energy in tropical environments.

The hue of human skin and hair is determined by the presence of [[pigment]]s called [[melanin]]s. Human skin hues can range from dark brown to pale pink, or even nearly white or colorless, such as in cases of [[Albinism]]. Human hair ranges from white to [[brown hair|brown]] to [[red hair|red]] to most commonly [[black hair|black]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Rogers, Alan R., Iltis, David & Wooding, Stephen | year=2004 | title=Genetic variation at the MC1R locus and the time since loss of human body hair | journal=Current Anthropology | volume=45 | issue=1 | pages=105–108 | doi=10.1086/381006}}</ref> This depends on the amount of melanin (an effective sun blocking pigment) in the skin and hair, with hair melanin concentrations in hair fading with increased age, leading to [[grey hair|grey]] or even white hair. Most researchers believe that skin darkening was an adaptation that evolved as a protection against [[ultraviolet]] [[solar radiation]], which also helps balancing [[folate]], which is destroyed by ultraviolet radiation, and [[vitamin D]], which requires sunlight to form.<ref>Jablonski, N.G. & Chaplin, G. (2000).

''Biological Perspectives on Human Pigmentation''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> Humans tend to be physically weaker than other similarly sized primates.{{cn|date=September 2012}}

The construction of the [[human pelvis]] differs from other primates, as do the toes. As a result, humans are slower for short distances than most other animals, but are among the best long-distance runners in the animal kingdom.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/health/27well.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Human Body Is Built for Distance | first=Tara | last=Parker-Pope | date=October 27, 2009}}</ref> Humans' thinner body hair and more productive [[sweat gland]]s also help avoid [[heat exhaustion]] while running for long distances. A trade-off for these advantages of the modern human pelvis is that childbirth is more difficult and dangerous, especially given the larger head size of human babies compared to other primates. This means that human babies must turn around as they pass through the birth canal which other primates do not do, and it makes humans the only species in which females require help from their conspecifics to reduce the risks of birthing.

The [[dentition|dental formula]] of Humans is: {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.2.3|lower=2.1.2.3}}. Humans have proportionately shorter [[palate]]s and much smaller teeth than other primates. They are the only primates to have short, relatively flush [[canine teeth]]. Humans have characteristically crowded teeth, with gaps from lost teeth usually closing up quickly in young individuals. Humans are gradually losing their [[wisdom teeth]], with some individuals having them congenitally absent.<ref name="Revolution">{{cite book | author = Collins, Desmond |url = | title = The Human Revolution: From Ape to Artist | year = 1976 | page = 208  }}</ref>

===Genetics===

[[File:Karyotype.png|250px|thumb|right|A graphical representation of the ideal human [[karyotype]], including both the male and female variant of the sex chromosome (number 23).]]
Like all mammals humans are a [[ploidy|diploid]] [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] species. Each [[Somatic cell|somatic]] [[cell (biology)|cell]] has two sets of 23 [[chromosome]]s, each set received from one parent, [[gamete]]s have only one set of chromosomes which is a mixture of the two parental sets. Among the 23 chromosomes there are 22 pairs of [[autosome]]s and one pair of [[sex-determination system|sex chromosomes]]. Like other mammals, humans have an [[XY sex-determination system]], so that [[female]]s have the sex chromosomes XX and [[male]]s have XY.

One [[human genome]] was sequenced in full in 2003, and currently efforts are being made to achieve a sample of the genetic diversity of the species (see [[International HapMap Project]]).

By comparing the parts of the genome that are not under natural selection and which therefore accumulate mutations at a fairly steady rate, it is possible to reconstruct a genetic tree incorporating the entire human species since the last shared ancestor. Each time a certain mutation ([[Single nucleotide polymorphism]]) appears in an individual and is passed on to his or her descendants a [[haplogroup]] is formed including all of the descendants of the individual who will also carry that mutation. By comparing [[mtDNA|mitochondrial DNA]] which is inherited only from the mother, geneticists have concluded that the last female common ancestor whose genetic marker is found in all modern humans, the so-called [[mitochondrial Eve]], must have lived around 200,000 years ago.

The forces of [[natural selection]] have continued to operate on human populations, with evidence that certain regions of the [[genome]] display [[directional selection]] in the past 15,000 years.<ref name="urlNYT">{{cite news |author=Wade, Nicholas |title=Still Evolving, Human Genes Tell New Story |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/07/science/07evolve.html |date=March 7, 2007 |accessdate=2012-02-13 |publisher=The New York Times}}</ref>

As with other mammals, ''[[human reproduction]]'' takes place as [[internal fertilization]] by [[human sexual intercourse|sexual intercourse]].  During this process, the [[erection|erect]] [[human penis|penis]] of the male is inserted into the female's [[vagina]] until the male [[ejaculate]]s semen, which contains sperm. The sperm travels through the vagina and cervix into the uterus or Fallopian tubes for fertilization of the ovum.  Upon [[human fertilization|fertilization]] and [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]], gestation then occurs within the female's uterus.

The [[zygote]] divides inside the female's [[uterus]] to become an [[embryo]], which over a period of 38 weeks (9 months) of [[gestation]] becomes a [[fetus]]. After this span of time, the fully grown fetus is [[childbirth|birthed]] from the woman's body and breathes independently as an infant for the first time. At this point, most modern cultures recognize the baby as a person entitled to the full protection of the law, though some jurisdictions extend various levels of [[personhood]] earlier to human fetuses while they remain in the uterus.

Compared with other species, human childbirth is dangerous. Painful labors lasting 24 hours or more are not uncommon and sometimes lead to the death of the mother, the child or both.<ref>According to the July'' 2: 2007 [[Newsweek]]'' magazine, a woman dies in childbirth every minute, most often due to uncontrolled bleeding and infection, with the world's poorest women most vulnerable.

Nonetheless, there is important biological variation in the human species – with traits such as skin color, eye color, hair color and texture, height and build, and cranial features varying clinally across the globe. Those aspects of genetic variation that give clues to human evolutionary history, or which are relevant for medical research have received particular attention. For example the genes that cause adult humans to be able to [[lactase|digest lactose]] are present in high frequencies in population that have long histories of cattle domestication, suggesting natural selection having favored that gene in populations that depend on cow milk. Some hereditary diseases such as [[Sickle cell anemia]] are frequent in populations from areas in which [[Malaria]] has been endemic throughout history – it is believed that the same gene causes increased resistance to Malaria among those who are unaffected [[heterozygous|carriers]]. Similarly populations that have inhabited specific climates such as arctic or tropical regions or high altitudes, tend to have developed specific phenotypes that are beneficial for conserving energy in those environments — [[Allen's rule|short stature and stocky build in cold regions]], tall and lanky in hot regions, and with high lung capacities in [[Effects of high altitude on humans|high altitudes]]. Similarly variation in skin color varies clinally with darker colors around the equator where the added protection from the sun is thought to give an evolutionary advantage, and lighter skin tones closer to the poles where there is less sunlight and the lighter colored skin improves [[Vitamin D]] synthesis.

Today it is possible to determine, by [[Human genetic variation|genetic analysis]], the geographic ancestry of a person and the degree of ancestry from each region. Such analyses can pinpoint the [[Early human migrations|migrational history]] of a person's ancestors with a high degree of accuracy. Often, due to practices of group [[endogamy]], [[allele]] frequencies cluster locally around [[kinship|kin groups]] and lineages, or by [[nation]]al, [[culture|cultural]] or [[language|linguistic]] boundaries, giving a detailed degree of correlation between genetic clusters and population groups when considering many alleles simultaneously.

There is considerable biological variation in between human populations across the globe, resulting in fairly variable phenotypes. Traditionally human phenotypical variation has been described as breaking down into large continental races, characterized by easily definable traits. Humans were then classified into one of four or five phenotypical groups often based on [[skin color]], hair texture, and facial anatomy, and which were matched to a continent with which each group were associated. Often racial classification of humans was described in terms of essential characteristics, and came to serve as a way of naturalizing social and cultural stereotypes about racial groups, in turn justifying or motivating different forms of [[racism]]. As the study of human biological variation advanced it became clear that most variation is [[cline (biology)|clinally distributed]] and blends gradually from one area to the next, with no clear boundaries between continents, additionally different traits have different clinal distributions. This realization made many anthropologists and biologists abandon the idea of major human races, instead describing biological variation in terms of populations and clinally distributed traits. 

Today there is no scientific consensus on the biological relevance of race. While biological characteristics of an individual can give many clues about the geographical origin of their ancestors, anthropologists generally reject the notion of human "race" as a biological classification scheme. Instead they see it as a set of [[social construction]]s that map onto, but partly obscures, biological variation. Most anthropologists also maintain that the term "race" tacitly assumes that races are clearly bounded groups with essential characteristics, often ordered hierarchically and used to justify social inequality.<ref>{{cite book | last1= Marks |first1=J |year=1995 |title= Human biodiversity: genes, race, and history |publisher= Aldine de Gruyter | location= New York | isbn = 0-585-39559-4 |ref=harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=AAA| url=http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm |title=American Anthropological Association Statement on "Race" |publisher=Aaanet.org |date=1998-05-17 |accessdate=2009-04-18|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Smedley |first=Audrey |title=The History of the Idea of Race... and Why It Matters |publisher=presented at the conference “Race, Human Variation and Disease: Consensus and Frontiers” sponsored by the American Anthropological Association (AAA) |date=2007-March-14-17 |url=http://www.understandingrace.org/resources/pdf/disease/smedley.pdf |ref=harv}}</ref> An opposing view has it that it is possible to talk about "races" without making essentialist or hierarchical assumptions, and some biologists and many forensic scientists use the word race to describe biological variation associated with continental ancestry.

The use of the term "race" to mean something like "[[subspecies]]" among humans is obsolete; ''Homo sapiens'' has no existing subspecies (with the exception of ''Homo sapiens sapiens'', the subspecies which includes all existing humans). In its modern scientific connotation, the term is not applicable to a species as genetically homogeneous as the human one, as stated in the declaration on race (UNESCO 1950, re-ratified 1978<ref name="1978UNESCO">[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13161&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html "Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice"], [[UNESCO]], 1978.

{{Further|Human brain|Mind}}
[[File:NIA human brain drawing.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Drawing of the human brain, showing several important structures]]

The [[human brain]], the focal point of the [[central nervous system]] in humans, controls the [[peripheral nervous system]]. In addition to controlling "lower", involuntary, or primarily [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] activities such as [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and [[digestion]], it is also the locus of "higher" order functioning such as [[thought]], [[reason]]ing, and [[abstraction]].<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/brain/3d/index.html 3-D Brain Anatomy], ''The Secret Life of the Brain'', Public Broadcasting Service. Retrieved April 3, 2005.</ref> These [[mental function|cognitive processes]] constitute the [[mind]], and, along with their [[behavior]]al consequences, are studied in the field of [[psychology]].

Generally regarded as more capable of these higher order activities, the human brain is believed to be more "intelligent" in general than that of any other known species. While some non-human species are capable of creating structures and [[Tool use by animals|using simple tools]]—mostly through instinct and mimicry—human technology is vastly more complex, and is constantly evolving and improving through time.

===Sleep and dreaming===
{{Main|Sleep|Dream}}
Humans are generally [[Diurnality|diurnal]]. The average [[sleep]] requirement is between seven and nine hours per day for an adult and nine to ten hours per day for a child; elderly people usually sleep for six to seven hours. Having less sleep than this is common among humans, even though [[sleep deprivation]] can have negative health effects. A sustained restriction of adult sleep to four hours per day has been shown to correlate with changes in physiology and mental state, including reduced memory, fatigue, aggression, and bodily discomfort.<ref name=Grandner2010>{{cite journal |author=Grandner, Michael A.; Patel, Nirav P.; Gehrman, Philip R.; Perlis, Michael L.; Pack, Allan I. |title=Problems associated with short sleep: bridging the gap between laboratory and epidemiological studies |journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews |year=2010 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=239–47 |pmid=19896872 |pmc=2888649 |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2009.08.001}}</ref><!--cites previous two sentences--> During sleep humans [[dream]].

[[File:FBE CTU lecture.jpg|thumb|Lecture at the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, [[Czech Technical University in Prague|CTU]] in Prague.]]
The human brain [[perception|perceives]] the external world through the [[sense]]s, and each individual human is influenced greatly by his or her experiences, leading to [[subjectivity|subjective]] views of [[existence]] and the passage of time. Humans are variously said to possess [[consciousness]], [[self-awareness]], and a mind, which correspond roughly to the mental processes of [[thought]]. These are said to possess qualities such as self-awareness, [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and the ability to perceive the relationship between [[Personal identity (philosophy)|oneself]] and one's [[natural environment|environment]]. The extent to which the mind constructs or experiences the outer world is a matter of debate, as are the definitions and validity of many of the terms used above.

The physical aspects of the mind and brain, and by extension of the nervous system, are studied in the field of [[neurology]], the more behavioral in the field of psychology, and a sometimes loosely defined area between in the field of psychiatry, which treats mental illness and behavioral disorders. Psychology does not necessarily refer to the brain or nervous system, and can be framed purely in terms of [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] or [[information processing]] theories of the mind. Increasingly, however, an understanding of brain functions is being included in psychological theory and practice, particularly in areas such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[neuropsychology]], and [[cognitive neuroscience]].

The nature of thought is central to psychology and related fields. [[Cognitive psychology]] studies [[cognition]], the [[mental function|mental processes']] underlying behavior. It uses [[information processing]] as a framework for understanding the mind. Perception, learning, problem solving, memory, attention, language and emotion are all well researched areas as well. Cognitive psychology is associated with a school of thought known as [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], whose adherents argue for an [[information processing]] model of mental function, informed by [[positivism]] and [[experimental psychology]]. Techniques and models from cognitive psychology are widely applied and form the mainstay of psychological theories in many areas of both research and applied psychology. Largely focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, [[developmental psychology]] seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or [[moral development]].

Some philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, which is experience itself, and access consciousness, which is the processing of the things in experience.<ref name="Bl">Ned Block: ''On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness'' in: ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 1995.</ref> Phenomenal consciousness is the state of being conscious, such as when they say "I am conscious." Access consciousness is being conscious ''of'' something in relation to abstract concepts, such as when one says "I am conscious of these words." Various forms of access consciousness include awareness, self-awareness, conscience, [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Husserl's phenomenology]], and [[intentionality]]. The concept of phenomenal consciousness, in modern history, according to some, is closely related to the concept of [[qualia]]. [[Social psychology]] links sociology with psychology in their shared study of the nature and causes of human social interaction, with an emphasis on how people think towards each other and how they relate to each other. The behavior and mental processes, both human and non-human, can be described through [[animal cognition]], [[ethology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[comparative psychology]] as well. [[Human ecology]] is an [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] that investigates how humans and human [[society|societies]] interact with both their natural environment and the human [[social environment]].

===Motivation and emotion===
{{Main|Motivation|Emotion}}
[[File:Plate depicting emotions of grief from Charles Darwin's book The Expression of the Emotions.jpg|right|thumb|Illustration of grief from [[Charles Darwin]]'s book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''.]]
[[Motivation]] is the driving force of desire behind all deliberate [[Action (philosophy)|actions]] of humans. Motivation is based on emotion—specifically, on the search for [[Contentment|satisfaction]] (positive emotional experiences), and the avoidance of conflict. Positive and negative is defined by the individual brain state, which may be influenced by [[social norm]]s: a person may be driven to [[self-injury]] or [[violence]] because their [[Human brain|brain]] is conditioned to create a positive response to these actions. Motivation is important because it is involved in the performance of all learned responses. Within [[psychology]], [[conflict avoidance]] and the [[libido]] are seen to be primary motivators. Within [[economics]], motivation is often seen to be based on [[incentive]]s; these may be [[financial]], [[moral]], or [[coercive]]. [[Religion]]s generally posit divine or [[demon]]ic influences.

[[Happiness]], or the state of being happy, is a human emotional condition. The definition of happiness is a common [[philosophy|philosophical]] topic. Some people might define it as the best condition that a human can have—a condition of [[mental health|mental]] and physical [[health]]. Others define it as [[wikt:freedom|freedom]] from want and [[suffering|distress]]; consciousness of the [[goodness and value theory|good]] order of things; assurance of one's place in the [[universe]] or [[society]].

Emotion has a significant influence on, or can even be said to control, human behavior, though historically many [[culture]]s and [[philosopher]]s have for various reasons discouraged allowing this influence to go unchecked. Emotional experiences perceived as [[pleasure|pleasant]], such as [[love]], admiration, or joy, contrast with those perceived as [[suffering|unpleasant]], like [[hate]], [[envy]], or [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]]. There is often a distinction made between refined emotions that are socially learned and [[wikt:survival|survival]] oriented emotions, which are thought to be innate. Human exploration of emotions as separate from other neurological phenomena is worthy of note, particularly in cultures where emotion is considered separate from physiological state. In some cultural medical theories emotion is considered so synonymous with certain forms of physical health that no difference is thought to exist. The [[Stoicism|Stoics]] believed excessive emotion was harmful, while some [[Sufi]] teachers felt certain extreme emotions could yield a conceptual perfection, what is often translated as [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]].

In modern scientific thought, certain refined emotions are considered a complex neural trait innate in a variety of [[domesticated animal|domesticated]] and non-domesticated [[mammal]]s. These were commonly developed in reaction to superior survival mechanisms and intelligent interaction with each other and the environment; as such, refined emotion is not in all cases as discrete and separate from natural neural function as was once assumed. However, when humans function in civilized tandem, it has been noted that uninhibited acting on extreme emotion can lead to social disorder and [[crime]].

===Sexuality and love===
{{Main|Love|Human sexuality}}
[[File:Sweet Baby Kisses Family Love.jpg|thumb|Human parents continue caring for their offspring long after they are born.]]
For humans, [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] has important social functions: it creates physical intimacy, bonds and hierarchies among individuals, besides ensuring biological [[reproduction]]. Humans are one of only two primate species, the other being the [[bonobo]], that frequently have sex outside of female fertile periods and that also often engage in sexual activity for no other purpose than pleasure and enjoyment, something that is very rare among other animals.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Sexual desire or [[libido]], is experienced as a bodily urge, often accompanied by strong emotions such as [[love]], [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]] and [[jealousy]]. The significance of sexuality in the human species is reflected in a number of physical features among them hidden [[ovulation]], the evolution of external [[scrotum]] and [[human penis|penis]] suggesting [[sperm]] competition, the absence of an [[Baculum|os penis]], permanent [[secondary sexual characteristics]] and the forming of [[pair bond]]s based on sexual attraction as a common social structure. Contrary to other primates that often advertise [[estrus]] through visible signs, human females do not have a distinct or visible signs of ovulation plus they experience sexual desire outside of their fertile periods. These adaptations indicate that the meaning of sexuality in humans is similar to that found in the [[Bonobo]], and that the complex human sexual behavior has a long [[evolution]]ary history.<ref name=Haviland2010>{{cite book |author=Haviland, Wiliam A.; Prins, Harald E.L.; McBride, Bunny; Walrath, Dana |title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge |year=2010 |publisher=Wadsworth/Cengage Learning |location=Belmont, California |page=82 |isbn=978-0-495-81082-7 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yP6TrXRpPdMC&pg=PA82}}</ref><!--cites last sentence-->

Human choices in acting on sexuality are commonly influenced by cultural norms which vary widely. Restrictions are often determined by religious beliefs or social customs. The pioneering researcher [[Sigmund Freud]] believed that humans are born [[Psychosexual development|polymorphously perverse]], which means that any number of objects could be a source of pleasure. According to Freud humans then pass through five stages of [[psychosexual development]] and can fixate on any stage because of various traumas during the process. For [[Alfred Kinsey]], another influential sex researcher, people can fall anywhere along a continuous scale of [[sexual orientation]], with only small minorities fully [[heterosexual]] or [[homosexual]]. Recent studies of [[neurology]] and [[genetics]] suggest people may be born predisposed to various sexual tendencies.<ref name=Buss2003>{{cite book |author=Buss, David M. |year=2003 |title=The Evolution of Desire: Strategies of Human Mating.

{{main|Culture|Society}}
Humans are highly social beings and tend to live in large complex social groups. More than any other creature, humans are adept at utilizing systems of [[communication]] for self-expression, the exchange of ideas, and [[social organization|organization]], and as such have created complex [[social structures]] composed of many cooperating and competing groups. Human groups range from families to [[nations]]. Social interactions between humans have established an extremely wide variety of values, social norms, and rituals, which together form the basis of human [[society]].

[[Culture]] is defined here as patterns of complex symbolic behavior, i.e. all behavior that is not innate but which has to be learned through social interaction with others; such as the use of distinctive [[material culture|material]] and [[symbolic system]]s, including language, ritual, social organization, traditions, beliefs and technology.

===Language===
{{Main|Language|Origin of language}}
The human capacity to exchange [[information]] and [[idea]]s through speech (and recently, writing) is unparalleled in other species. Unlike the closed sign systems of other primates in which sounds are unique and mutually exclusive, human language is open – an infinite number of meanings can be produced by combining a limited number of sounds and words. Human language also has the capacity of [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], using words to represent things and happenings that are not presently or locally occurring, but reside in the shared imagination of interlocutors.<ref name="Revolution"/> Basic displacement may occur in other species, but is uniquely elaborated in humans, allowing symbols and language to refer to abstract or even purely imaginary states, and underpinning the complex symbolic culture of the species. Humans are the only species able to ask [[question]]s. Unlike [[chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobo]]s, who are able to answer complex questions but can not formulate and ask questions themselves, humans ask questions from a very early age.<ref>{{cite book | title = [[Who Asked the First Question?]] The Origins of Human Choral Singing, Intelligence, Language and Speech | last1 = Jordania | first1=Joseph | isbn = 99940-31-81-3 |year = 2006 | publisher = Logos | location = Tbilisi}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title =  The mind of an ape | first1= David | last1=Premack |first2=Ann J. |last2= Premack |year = 1983 | publisher =  [[W. W. Norton & Company]] | location = New York, London |page=29}}</ref> Human language is also unique in being a [[Origin of speech#Modality-independence|modality independent]] sign system, the same meanings can be conveyed through different media, auditively in speech, visually by gestural signs or writing and even through tactile media such as [[braille]]. The faculty of language is a defining feature of humanity, and a [[cultural universal]].
Language is central to the communication between humans, and to the sense of identity that unites nations, cultures and ethnic groups. The invention of writing systems at least five thousand years ago allowed the preservation of language on material objects, and was a major technological advancement. The science of [[linguistics]] describes the structure and function of language and the relationship between languages. There are approximately six thousand different languages currently in use, including [[sign language]]s, and many thousands more that are [[extinct language|extinct]].<ref name=Comrie1996>{{cite book |author=Comrie, Bernard; Polinsky, Maria; Matthews, Stephen |title=The Atlas of Languages: The Origin and Development of Languages Throughout the World |year=1996 |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York, New York |pages=13–15 |isbn=978-0-8160-3388-1}}</ref>

===Gender roles===
{{Main|Gender role|Gender}}
The sexual division of humans into male and female has been marked culturally by a corresponding division of roles, norms, [[practice (social theory)|practices]], dress, behavior, [[rights]], [[duty|duties]], [[privilege]]s, [[social status|status]], and [[power (philosophy)|power]]. [[Cultural identity|Cultural differences]] by gender have often been believed to have arisen naturally out of a division of reproductive labor; the biological fact that women give birth led to their further cultural responsibility for nurturing and caring for children. [[Gender role]]s have varied historically, and challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies.

===Kinship===
{{main|Kinship|marriage}}
[[File:Indian family in Brazil posed in front of hut.jpg|thumb|right|Humans often live in family-based social structures.]]
All human societies organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations between parents and children ([[consanguinity]]), and relations through [[marriage]] ([[Affinity (law)|affinity]]). These kinds of relations are generally called kinship relations. In most societies kinship places mutual responsibilities and expectations of solidarity on the individuals that are so related, and those who recognize each other as kinsmen come to form networks through which other social institutions can be regulated. Among the many functions of kinship is the ability to form [[descent group]]s, groups of people sharing a common line of descent, which can function as political units such as [[clan]]s. Another function is the way in which kinship unites families through marriage, forming [[Alliance theory|kinship alliances]] between groups of wife-takers and wife-givers. Such alliances also often have important political and economical ramifications, and may result in the formation of political organization above the community level. Kinship relations often includes regulations for whom an individual should or shouldn't marry. All societies have rules of [[incest taboo]], according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations are prohibited - such rules vary widely between cultures. Some societies also have rules of preferential marriage with certain kin relations, frequently with either [[Parallel and cross cousins|cross or parallel cousins]]. Rules and norms for marriage and social behavior among kinsfolk is often reflected in the systems of [[kinship terminology]] in the various languages of the world. In many societies kinship relations can also be formed through forms of co-habitation, adoption, fostering, or companionship, which also tends to create relations of enduring solidarity.

===Ethnicity===
{{main|Ethnic group}}
Humans often form [[ethnic groups]], such groups tend to be larger than kinship networks and be organized around a common identity  defined variously in terms of shared ancestry and history, shared cultural norms and language, or shared biological phenotype. Such ideologies of shared characteristics are often perpetuated in the form of powerful, compelling narratives that give legitimacy and continuity to the set of shared values.  Ethnic groupings often correspond to some level of political organization such as the [[Band society|band]], [[tribe]], [[city state]] or [[nation]]. Although ethnic groups appear and disappear through history, members of ethnic groups often conceptualize their groups as having histories going back into the deep past. Such ideologies give ethnicity a powerful role in defining [[social identity]] and in constructing solidarity between members of an ethno-political unit.  This unifying property of ethnicity has been closely tied to the rise of the [[nation state]] as the predominant form of political organization in the 19th and 20th century.<ref>J. Hutchinson & A.D.

===Society, government, and politics===
[[File:United Nations HQ - New York City.jpg|thumb|right|The [[United Nations]] complex in [[New York City]], which houses one of the largest political organizations in the world]]
{{Main|Origins of society|Society|Government|Politics|State (polity)}}
[[Society]] is the system of organizations and institutions arising from interaction between humans. A [[State (polity)|state]] is an organized [[politics|political]] community occupying a definite territory, having an organized [[government]], and possessing internal and external [[sovereignty]]. Recognition of the state's claim to independence by other states, enabling it to enter into international agreements, is often important to the establishment of its statehood. The "state" can also be defined in terms of domestic conditions, specifically, as conceptualized by [[Max Weber]], "a state is a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the 'legitimate' use of physical force within a given territory."<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20020612070242/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/www/study/xWeb.htm Max Weber's definition of the modern state 1918], by [[Max Weber]], 1918. Retrieved March 17, 2006.</ref>

[[Government]] can be defined as the [[politics|political]] means of creating and enforcing [[law]]s; typically via a [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] [[hierarchy]]. [[Politics]] is the process by which decisions are made within groups; this process often involves conflict as well as compromise. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within [[government]]s, politics is also observed in all human group interactions, including corporate, academic, and religious institutions. Many different political systems exist, as do many different ways of understanding them, and many definitions overlap. Examples of governments include [[monarchy]], [[Communist state]], [[military dictatorship]], [[theocracy]], and [[liberal democracy]], the last of which is considered dominant today. All of these issues have a direct relationship with economics.

===Trade and economics===
{{Main|Trade|Economics}}
[[File:Tengeru market.jpg|thumb|right|[[Buyer]]s and [[seller]]s [[bargaining]] in a market]]
Trade is the voluntary exchange of goods and services, and is a form of [[economics]]. A mechanism that allows trade is called a [[market]]. The original form of trade was [[barter (economics)|barter]], the direct exchange of goods and services. Modern traders instead generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as money. As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or [[earnings|earning]]. The invention of money (and later [[Credit (finance)|credit]], paper money and non-physical money) greatly simplified and promoted trade. Because of specialization and [[division of labor]], most people concentrate on a small aspect of manufacturing or service, trading their labor for products. Trade exists between regions because different regions have an [[Absolute advantage|absolute]] or [[comparative advantage]] in the production of some tradable commodity, or because different regions' size allows for the benefits of [[mass production]].

Economics is a [[social science]] which studies the production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods and services. Economics focuses on measurable variables, and is broadly divided into two main branches: [[microeconomics]], which deals with individual agents, such as households and businesses, and macroeconomics, which considers the economy as a whole, in which case it considers [[aggregate supply]] and [[aggregate demand|demand]] for money, [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[commodity|commodities]]. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are [[resource allocation]], production, distribution, trade, and [[competition]]. Economic logic is increasingly applied to any problem that involves choice under scarcity or determining economic [[Value (economics)|value]].

===War===
{{Main|War}}
[[File:MokoShuraiE-Kotoba IV.jpg|thumb|Japanese samurai attacking a Mongol ship in the 13th century. Warfare has been an integral aspect of all human societies since before the rise of civilization.]]
War is a state of widespread conflict between states or other large groups of humans, which is characterized by the use of lethal [[violence]] between combatants and/or upon [[civilians]]. (Humans also engage in lesser conflicts, such as brawls, [[riots]], [[revolts]], and [[melees]]. A [[revolution]] may or [[Nonviolent revolution|may not]] involve warfare.) It is estimated that during the 20th century between 167 and 188 million humans died as a result of war.<ref>Ferguson, Niall. "The Next War of the World." Foreign Affairs, Sep/Oct 2006</ref> A common perception of war is a series of [[military campaign]]s between at least two opposing sides involving a dispute over [[sovereignty]], territory, [[natural resource|resources]], [[religion]], or other issues. A war between internal elements of a state is a [[civil war]].

There have been a wide variety of [[Revolution in Military Affairs|rapidly advancing]] [[military tactics|tactics]] throughout the history of war, ranging from [[conventional war]] to [[asymmetric warfare]] to [[total war]] and [[unconventional warfare]]. Techniques include [[hand to hand combat]], the use of [[ranged weapons]], [[Naval warfare]], and, more recently, [[air support]]. Military intelligence has often played a key role in determining victory and defeat. Propaganda, which often includes information, slanted opinion and disinformation, plays a key role in maintaining unity within a warring group, and/or sowing discord among opponents. In modern warfare, [[soldier]]s and [[combat vehicle]]s are used to control the land, [[warships]] the sea, and [[aircraft]] the sky. These fields have also overlapped in the forms of marines, paratroopers, naval aircraft carriers, and surface-to-air missiles, among others. [[Satellites]] in [[low Earth orbit]] have made outer space a factor in warfare as well as it is used for detailed intelligence gathering, however no known aggressive actions have been taken from [[space warfare|space]].

Since then, humans have made major advances, developing complex technology to create tools to aid their lives and allowing for other advancements in culture. Major leaps in technology include the discovery of [[agriculture]] – what is known as the [[Neolithic Revolution]], and the invention of automated machines in the [[Industrial Revolution]].

[[Archaeology]] attempts to tell the story of past or lost cultures in part by close examination of the [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] they produced. Early humans left [[stone tools]], [[pottery]], and [[jewelry]] that are particular to various regions and times.

[[Body modification]] is the deliberate altering of the [[human anatomy|human body]] for any non-medical reason, such as aesthetics, sexual enhancement, a rite of passage, religious reasons, to display group membership or affiliation, to create [[body art]], shock value, or self-expression.<ref name="DeMello2007"/> In its most broad definition it includes [[plastic surgery]], socially acceptable decoration (''e.g.'', common [[earring|ear piercing]] in many societies), and religious rites of passage (e.g., [[circumcision]] in a number of cultures).<ref name="DeMello2007">{{cite book|author=Margo DeMello|title=Encyclopedia of Body Adornment|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=s0122BsqrZwC&pg=PR17|accessdate=6 April 2012|year=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-33695-9|pages=17–}}</ref>

===Religion and spirituality===
{{Main|Religion|Spirituality}}

[[File:Nsibidi.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Nsibidi]] script from [[Nigeria]]. A means of communication among the initiates of the [[Ekpe]] [[secret society]].<ref>Diringer, David, "The alphabet: a key to the history of mankind", Volume 1, p 107,  Funk & Wagnalls, 1968.</ref>]]

[[Religion]] is generally defined as a [[belief]] system concerning the [[supernatural]], [[sacred]] or [[divinity|divine]], and practices, [[values]], institutions and [[ritual]]s associated with such belief.  Some religions also have a [[moral code]].  The [[Evolutionary psychology of religion|evolution]] and the history of the [[Evolutionary origin of religions|first religions]] have recently become areas of active scientific investigation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://evolution.binghamton.edu/religion/|title=Evolutionary Religious Studies: A New Field of Scientific Inquiry}}</ref><ref name=Boyer2008>{{cite journal |author=Boyer, Pascal |title=Being human: Religion: bound to believe? |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7216 |pages=1038–1039 |year=2008 |pmid=18948934 |doi=10.1038/4551038a}}</ref><ref name=Emmons2003>{{Cite journal |author=Emmons, Robert A.; Paloutzian, Raymond F. |title=The psychology of religion |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |year=2003 |pmid=12171998 |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages= 377–402 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145024}}</ref> However, in the course of its [[development of religion|development]], religion has taken on many forms that vary by culture and individual perspective. Some of the chief questions and issues religions are concerned with include life after death (commonly involving belief in an [[afterlife]]), the [[origin of life]], the nature of the [[universe]] ([[religious cosmology]]) and its [[ultimate fate of the universe|ultimate fate]] ([[eschatology]]), and what is [[morality|moral]] or immoral. A common source for answers to these questions are beliefs in [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] [[divinity|divine]] beings such as [[deity|deities]] or a singular [[God]], although not all religions are [[theism|theistic]]. Spirituality, belief or involvement in matters of the [[soul]] or [[spirit]], is one of the many different approaches humans take in trying to answer fundamental questions about humankind's place in the universe, the [[meaning of life]], and the ideal way to live one's life. Though these topics have also been addressed by philosophy, and to some extent by science, spirituality is unique in that it focuses on [[mystical]] or supernatural concepts such as [[karma]] and God.

Although the exact level of religiosity can be hard to measure,<ref name=Hall2008>{{cite journal |author=Hall, Daniel E.; Meador, Keith G.; Koenig, Harold G. |title=Measuring religiousness in health research: review and critique |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=134–163 |year=2008 |pmid=19105008 |doi=10.1007/s10943-008-9165-2}}</ref> a majority of humans professes some variety of religious or spiritual belief, although some are [[irreligion|irreligious]]. Other humans have no religious beliefs or are [[atheism|atheists]], [[scientific skeptics]], [[agnostics]] or simply [[non-religious]]. [[Humanism]] is a philosophy which seeks to include all of humanity and all issues common to humans; it is usually non-religious. Most religions and spiritual beliefs are clearly distinct from science on both a philosophical and methodological level; the two are not generally considered mutually exclusive and a majority of humans hold a mix of both scientific and religious views. The distinction between philosophy and religion, on the other hand, is at times less clear, and the two are linked in such fields as the [[philosophy of religion]] and [[theology]].

===Philosophy and self-reflection===

[[Philosophy]] is a discipline or field of study involving the investigation, analysis, and development of ideas at a general, abstract, or fundamental level. It is the discipline searching for a general understanding of reality, reasoning and values. Major fields of philosophy include [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[axiology]] (which includes [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]). Philosophy covers a very wide range of approaches, and is used to refer to a [[worldview]], to a perspective on an issue, or to the positions argued for by a particular philosopher or school of philosophy.

===Science and mathematics===
{{Main|Science|Mathematics}}

Another unique aspect of human culture and thought is the development of complex methods for acquiring knowledge through observation and quantification. The [[scientific method]] has been developed to acquire knowledge of the physical world and the rules, processes and principles of which it consists, and combined with [[mathematics]] it enables the prediction of complex patterns of causality and consequence. Some other animals are able to recognize differences in small quantities, but humans are able to understand and recognize much larger, even abstract, quantities, and to recognize and understand algorithmic patterns which enables infinite [[counting]] routines and algebra, something that is not found in any other species.

===Art, music, and literature===
{{Main|Art|Music|Literature}}
[[File:Lorenzo Lippi 001.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Allegory of Music'' (ca. 1594), a [[painting]] of a woman writing [[sheet music]] by [[Lorenzo Lippi]]]] Art is a [[cultural universal]], and humans have been producing artistic works at least since the days of [[Cro Magnon]].  As a form of [[culture|cultural]] expression by humans, art may be defined by the pursuit of [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and the usage of [[narrative]]s of liberation and exploration (i.e. [[art history]], [[art criticism]], and [[art theory]]) to mediate its boundaries. This distinction may be applied to objects or performances, current or historical, and its prestige extends to those who made, found, exhibit, or own them. In the modern use of the word, art is commonly understood to be the process or result of making material works that, from concept to creation, adhere to the "creative impulse" of human beings. Art is distinguished from other works by being in large part unprompted by necessity, by biological drive, or by any undisciplined pursuit of recreation.

Music is a natural [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] phenomenon based on the three distinct and interrelated organization structures of rhythm, harmony, and melody. Listening to music is perhaps the most common and universal form of [[entertainment]] for humans, while learning and understanding it are popular [[discipline]]s. There are a wide variety of [[music genre]]s and [[ethnic music]]s. [[Literature]], the body of written—and possibly oral—works, especially creative ones, includes prose, poetry and drama, both fiction and [[non-fiction]]. Literature includes such genres as [[epic poetry|epic]], legend, myth, ballad, and folklore.
