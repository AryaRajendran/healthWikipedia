[[Image:Amphetamine-2D-skeletal.svg|thumb|right|200px|[[Amphetamine]], the prototypical releasing agent, which acts on norepinephrine and dopamine.]]

A '''releasing agent''' ('''RA'''), or simply '''releaser''', is a [[drug]] that induces the [[synapse|release]] of a [[neurotransmitter]] from the [[synapse|presynaptic neuron]] into the [[synapse]], leading to an increase in the [[extracellular]] [[concentration]]s of the [[neurotransmitter]]. Many drugs use [[neurotransmitter]] [[synapse|release]] to exert their [[psychological]] and [[physiological]] effects, namely the [[amphetamine]]s and related [[chemical compound|compound]]s. Virtually all currently known releasing agents affect the [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s [[serotonin]] (5-HT), [[norepinephrine]] (NE), and/or [[dopamine]] (DA), and as such, they are often referred to more formally as ''monoamine releasing agents'' (''MRAs'').

==Mechanism of action==
Releasing agents cause the [[synapse|release]] of [[monoamine]] [[neurotransmitter]]s by a complex [[mechanism of action]]. First, they enter the [[synapse|presynaptic]] [[neuron]] primarily via [[membrane transport protein|membrane transporters]], including the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT), [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET), and/or [[serotonin transporter]] (SERT). Some, such as [[amphetamine]] and [[methamphetamine]], can also [[passive transport|diffuse]] directly across the [[cell membrane]] to varying degrees. Next, they inhibit vesicular uptake of the neurotransmitter by interfering with a [[vesicular transporter]] such as [[vesicular monoamine transporter 2]] (VMAT2)<ref>Question: Is release restricted to MAs only?</ref> (via [[binding site|binding]] or [[pH]]-gradient), and thus inhibit the [[active transport|repackaging]] of the neurotransmitter(s) from the [[cytoplasm]] into [[Synaptic vesicle|vesicles]]. Finally, releasing agents [[transporter reversal|reverse]] the action of monoamine reuptake [[transport protein|transporter(s)]] via a process known as [[phosphorylation]], allowing the neurotransmitter(s) to flow out from the [[cytoplasm]] into the [[nerve terminal]] or [[synapse]].  The result is increased [[monoamine]]rgic [[neurotransmission]].  The postsynaptic effect is enhanced due to the agents' interaction with reupake transporters; one method by which the action of monoamines is terminated is via reuptake into the presynaptic neuron, and disruption of this process causes further increases in extracellular monoamine concentration.

==Selectivity==
Releasing agents act to varying extents on serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Some induce the release of all three neurotransmitters to a similar degree, like [[3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine|MDMA]], while others are more [[binding selectivity|selective]]. As examples, [[methamphetamine]] is a [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] releasing agent of norepinephrine and dopamine but only a very weak releaser of serotonin (~30- and 60-fold less than dopamine and norepinephrine, respectively) and [[1,3-benzodioxolyl-N-methylbutanamine|MBDB]] is a fairly balanced releaser of serotonin and norepinephrine but a weak releaser of dopamine (~6- and 10-fold lower for dopamine than norepinephrine or serotonin, respectively). Even more selective include agents like [[fenfluramine]] and [[ephedrine]], which are selective releasing agents of serotonin and norepinephrine, respectively.

As of present, no selective dopamine releasing agents are known. This is because it has proven virtually impossible to separate DAT affinity from NET affinity and retain releasing efficacy at the same time.<ref name="pmid17408232">{{cite journal | author = Rothman RB, Blough BE, Baumann MH | title = Dual dopamine/serotonin releasers as potential medications for stimulant and alcohol addictions | journal = The AAPS Journal | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = E1–10 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17408232 | pmc = 2751297 | doi = 10.1208/aapsj0901001 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1208/aapsj0901001}}</ref> Accordingly, no known selective serotonin and dopamine releasing agents are known either; though, [[UWA-101]], a [[serotonin-dopamine reuptake inhibitor]],<ref name="pmid22345403">{{cite journal | author = Johnston TH, Millar Z, Huot P, ''et al.'' | title = A novel MDMA analogue, UWA-101, that lacks psychoactivity and cytotoxicity, enhances l-DOPA benefit in parkinsonian primates | journal = FASEB Journal : Official Publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology | volume = 26| issue = 5| pages = 2154–63| year = 2012 | month = February | pmid = 22345403 | doi = 10.1096/fj.11-195016 | url = http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=22345403}}</ref> is an amphetamine derivative as well as analogue of MDMA and could possess some releasing efficacy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The values above are expressed as [[dissociation constant|equilibrium dissociation constant]]s ([[Half maximal effective concentration|EC<sub>50</sub>]] ([[nanomolar|nM]])). Lower values correspond to higher binding at the site, or in other words, less is more. NE, DA, and 5-HT correspond to the abilities of the compounds to induce the release of [[norepinephrine]], [[dopamine]], and [[serotonin]], respectively. All compounds listed are [[racemic]] unless noted otherwise.

==Neurotoxicity==
Many releasing agents, notably many of those derived from [[amphetamine]], have been found to be [[neurotoxic]] to [[serotonin]] and/or [[dopamine]] [[neurons]] via damage to [[axon]]s and [[dendrite]]s, [[enzyme]]s, [[mitochondria]], [[DNA]], [[membrane transport protein|plasmalemmal]] and [[vesicular transport protein|vesicular transporter]]s, and the [[cell membrane]], ultimately causing [[cell death]] or [[apoptosis]] as a result. Examples include amphetamine, [[methamphetamine]], [[methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA]], [[fenfluramine]], and [[parachloroamphetamine|PCA]], among others. In contrast, [[piperazine]], [[aminoindane]], [[aminotetralin]], and [[oxazoline]] releasing agents, as well as those from various other [[chemical family|chemical families]], are considered to be either significantly less [[toxicity|toxic]], or fully non-[[toxicity|toxic]] in comparison, depending varyingly on the compound in question.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The neurotoxicity of some of these drugs is believed to be caused by [[oxidative stress]] induced by the generation of [[reactive oxygen species]] or [[free radical]]s, highly [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] [[particle]]s that rip apart [[protein]]s and induce [[chain reaction]]s of destruction. The [[free radical]]s are thought to be generated as [[byproduct]]s when either the base [[chemical compound|compound]] or one or more of its [[metabolite]]s are broken down by the [[enzyme]]s [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO-B) and/or [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX), among others, from within the presynaptic cell. [[Hyperthermia]] and simultaneous serotonin and dopamine release may play a major role in augmenting the damage as well. Monoamines themselves can be seen neurotoxic due to [[oxidative metabolism]]. This means even if a releasing agent is non-neurotoxic, the caused flood of [[monoamine]]s that are then metabolized by [[monoamine oxidase]] generate oxidative stress.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

These observations are supported by the facts that [[antioxidant]]s such as [[ascorbic acid]], [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO-B inhibitors]] like [[selegiline]], drugs that induce [[hypothermia]] such as [[5-HT2 receptor|5-HT<sub>2</sub>]], [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub>]], [[β-adrenergic receptor|β-adrenergic]], and [[NMDA receptor|NMDA]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]]s, as well as [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]] and [[GABAB receptor|GABA<sub>B</sub>]] receptor [[agonist]]s, and [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s and [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]]s, respectively, are [[neuroprotective]], and can help reduce damage caused by neurotoxic releasing agents.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}
