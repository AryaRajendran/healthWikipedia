In [[human anatomy]], the '''superior mesenteric artery''' (SMA) arises from the anterior surface of the [[abdominal aorta]], just inferior to the origin of the [[celiac artery|celiac trunk]], and supplies the [[intestine]] from the lower part of the [[duodenum]] through two-thirds of the [[transverse colon]], as well as the [[pancreas]].

==Location and path==
It arises anterior to lower border of vertebra L1 in an adult. It is usually 1cm lower than the celiac trunk. It initially travels in an anterior/inferior direction, passing behind/under the neck of the pancreas and the [[splenic vein]].  Located under this portion of the superior mesenteric artery, between it and the aorta, are the following:
* left [[renal vein]] - travels between the left [[kidney]] and the [[inferior vena cava]] (can be compressed between the SMA and the [[abdominal aorta]] at this location, leading to [[Nutcracker Syndrome]]).
* the third part of the [[duodenum]], a segment of the [[small intestines]] (can be compressed by the SMA at this location, leading to [[Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome]]).
* [[uncinate process of pancreas]] - this is a small part of the pancreas that hooks around the SMA.

The SMA typically runs to the left of the similarly named vein, the [[superior mesenteric vein]]. After passing the neck of the pancreas it starts giving off its branches.

==Branches==

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Branch''' || '''Supplies'''
 |- 
 | [[inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery]] || head of the [[pancreas]] and to the ascending and inferior parts of the [[duodenum]]
|- 
 | [[intestinal arteries]] || branches to [[ileum]], branches to [[jejunum]]
 |- 
 | [[ileocolic artery]]|| supplies last part of ileum, [[cecum]], and [[vermiform appendix|appendix]]
 |- 
| [[right colic artery]] || to ascending colon
 |- 
 | [[middle colic artery]] || to the transverse colon 
 |- 
|}

The middle, right, and [[ileocecal]] branches anastomose with each other to form a [[marginal artery of the colon|marginal artery]] along the inner border of the colon. This artery is completed by branches of the left colic which is a branch of the [[inferior mesenteric artery]].

==Pathophysiology==
* Compared to other vessels of similar size, the SMA is largely spared from the effects of [[atherosclerosis]]. This may be due to protective haemodynamic conditions.{{Fact|date=January 2009}}
* Acute occlusion of the SMA almost invariably leads to [[ischemic colitis|intestinal ischemia]] and often has devastating consequences, with up to 80% of SMA occlusions leading to death.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9845564 |year=1998 |month= |author=Redaelli CA, Schilling MK, Büchler MW |title=Intraoperative laser Doppler flowmetry: a predictor of ischemic injury in acute mesenteric infarction |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=55–9 |issn=0253-4886 |journal=Digestive surgery |doi=10.1159/000018587}}</ref>
* The SMA can compress the left [[renal vein]], leading to [[nutcracker syndrome]]; and/or the third (horizontal) part of the [[duodenum]], leading to [[superior mesenteric artery syndrome]].
