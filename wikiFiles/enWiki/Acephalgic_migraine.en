'''Acephalgic migraine''' (also called '''acephalalgic migraine''', '''migraine aura without headache''', '''amigrainous migraine''', '''isolated visual migraine''' and '''optical migraine''') is a neurological syndrome. It is a relatively uncommon variant of [[migraine]] in which the patient may experience [[Aura (symptom)|aura]], [[nausea]], [[photophobia]], [[hemiparesis]] and other migraine [[symptoms]] but does not experience [[headache]].<ref name=Goroll>{{cite book | title = Primary Care Medicine: Office Evaluation and Management of the Adult Patient | edition= 6th | last = Goroll |first = Allan H. | coauthors = Albert G.
