'''Cryotherapy''' is the local or general use of low temperatures in medical therapy. Cryotherapy is used to treat a variety of benign and malignant [[lesion]]s.<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1125851-overview</ref> The term "cryotherapy" comes from the Greek ''cryo'' (κρυο) meaning ''cold'', and ''therapy'' (θεραπεια) meaning ''cure''. Cryotherapy has been used as early as the seventeenth century.

Its goal is to decrease [[cellular metabolism]], increase cellular survival, decrease [[inflammation]], decrease [[pain]] and spasm, promote [[vasoconstriction]], and when using extreme temperatures, to destroy cells by crystallizing the [[cytosol]]. The most prominent use of the term refers to the surgical treatment, specifically known as [[cryosurgery]].  Other therapies that use the term are cryogenic chamber therapy and ice pack therapy.

== Hyperbaric gaseous cryotherapy ==
In 1993, the company [http://www.cryoinic-medical.com Cryonic Medical<ref>filed for bankruptcy in 2012</ref>] developed the hyperbaric gaseous cryotherapy also called NeuroCryoStimulation or NCS that can immediately relieve pain by acting on four physiological effects :
# Painkiller
# Vasomotor
# Anti-inflammatory
# Muscle relaxation

This technique, practiced by some doctors, physiotherapists and veterinarians consists in applying for a short time on the skin up to the painful area, [[carbon dioxide]] at -78°C with a pressure of 50 bars and a frequency of 400 Hz. Sessions can be repeated at will.
Unlike ice packs, the usage of carbon dioxide does not produce pain. Even if not as dangerous as liquid nitrogen used in cryosurgery, the low temperature could cause burns. This risk can be mitigated by using a limited volume of gas (80 gr) and by cutting the power supply of device as soon as the temperature of the skin reaches 2°C.

== Cryosurgery ==
{{Main|Cryosurgery}}
[[Image:Cryogun.jpg|right|thumb|Medical cryotherapy gun]]
Cryosurgery is the application of extreme cold to destroy abnormal or diseased tissue. Cryotherapy is used to treat a number of diseases and disorders, most especially skin conditions like [[warts]], [[Melanocytic_nevus|moles]], [[skin tags]] and [[solar keratoses]].  [[Liquid nitrogen]] is usually used to freeze the tissues at the cellular level. The procedure is used often because of its efficacy and low rates of side effects.

== Hilotherapy ==

Hilotherapy is a treatment, which allows the controlled application of cooling to selected areas of the face and body. A cuff is wrapped around the traumatized area, which is connected to the device that allows the traumatized area to be cooled at a specific temperature.  The difference between [http://hilotherapy.co.uk Hilotherapy] and other cryotherapy approaches is the range of temperature and the constant application.  By controlling the temperature between 10°C and 20°C, the typical benefits from cryotherapy occur, such as immediate [[vasoconstriction]] with reflexive [[vasodilation]], decreased local [[metabolism]] and [[enzymatic]] activity, and decreased oxygen demand.  However, by not reducing below 10°C, the [[lymphatic drainage]] is not disturbed, nor is the creation of [[fibroblasts]] and the [[microcirculation]], all of which cease to function during the normal application of ICE and when the tissue falls below the 10°C.  Hilotherapy is commonly used for the recovery of [[orthopedic surgery]], [[plastic surgery]] and [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery]].

== Ice pack therapy ==

Ice pack therapy is a treatment of cold temperatures to an injured area of the body. An [[ice pack]] is placed over an injured area and is intended to absorb heat of a closed traumatic or edematous injury by using conduction to transfer thermal energy. The physiologic effects of cold application include immediate [[vasoconstriction]] with reflexive [[vasodilation]], decreased local [[metabolism]] and [[enzymatic]] activity, and decreased oxygen demand. Cold decreases muscle [[spindle fiber]] activity and slows nerve conduction velocity, therefore it is often used to decrease spasticity and muscle guarding.  It is commonly used to alleviate the pain of minor injuries.

== Cryogenic chamber therapy ==

According to ''Costello et al'',<ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2011.01292.x/abstract</ref> a relatively new modality of cryotherapy, called Whole Body Cryotherapy (WBC), is currently being offered by clinicians as an alternative to cold water immersion or ice packs. Administered through the use of a cryogenic chamber, WBC is a treatment whereby the patient is placed in a [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] chamber for a short duration (i.e. no more than three minutes, which is comparable to [[ice swimming]]), and if used properly, will not destroy tissue.  Whole body cryotherapy originated in Japan in 1978. However, it was a group of Polish scientists who took the idea and made whole body cryotherapy the physical therapy it is today. The Olympic rehabilitation centre in Spala, Poland opened in May 2000 and has been used as a training and injury rehabilitation centre for many sporting bodies.

The chamber is cooled, typically with [[liquid nitrogen]], usually to a temperature of {{convert|-120|C}}—although temperatures of {{convert|-140|C}} or even {{convert|-160|C}} have been used.<ref name=Warburton>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/wales/rugby/story/143011.html |title=Warburton pushes through pain barrier |work=ESPN Scrum |date=2011-07-05 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}</ref> The patient is protected from acute frostbite with socks, gloves and mouth and ear protection, but in addition to that, wears nothing but a bathing suit. The patient spends a few minutes in the chamber. During treatment the average skin temperature drops to {{convert|12|C}}, while the coldest skin temperature can be {{convert|5|C}}. The core body temperature remains unchanged during the treatment, however it may drop slightly afterwards. Therapy triggers the release of [[endorphin]]s which induce [[analgesia]] (immediate pain relief).{{facts|date=November 2011}}

Patients report that the experience is invigorating and improves a variety of conditions such as psychological stress, insomnia, [[rheumatism]], muscle and joint pain, [[fibromyalgia]], [[itching]], and [[psoriasis]].{{facts|date=November 2011}} The immediate effect of skin cooling and analgesia lasts for 5 minutes, but the release of endorphins can have a lasting effect, where the pains and signs of inflammation as found in blood tests remain suppressed for weeks.{{facts|date=November 2011}} The effects of extreme cold and endorphin release are scientifically studied. Curiously, some patients compare the feeling to [[sauna]] at {{convert|110|C}}.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales rugby union international]] [[Sam Warburton]], who along with his teammates used the Spala facilities whilst training for the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]], has dubbed the chambers "evil saunas", but added:<blockquote>"I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a pretty savage experience, but the other side of the coin is that it is definitely working and allowing us to train in a way that would be impossible under normal conditions."<ref name=Warburton/></blockquote>

==Cryotherapy and headaches==
A study published in the September 2000 edition of the Archives of Family Medicine showed that a combination of pressure and cold temperatures can successfully mitigate [[headach]]e-related pain and also decrease the duration of a headache.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archfami.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/9/9/792| title=Pressure, Heat and Cold Help Relieve Headache Pain|date=|accessdate= 2010-07-21}}</ref> Eighty-seven percent of participants (p=.004) said that the combination of pressure as well as temperature therapy was "optimally effective"; 13% said that the temperature therapy was "moderately effective". Many products exist that provide temperature therapy, many times cryotherapy, to combat headaches.
