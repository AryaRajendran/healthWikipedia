The '''hip bone''' ('''innominate bone''', '''pelvic bone'''<ref>Merriam Webster, http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/hip+bone</ref> or '''coxal bone''') is a large, [[Flat bone]], constricted in the center and expanded above and below. In some [[vertebrate]]s (including humans) it is composed of three bones; [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]], [[ischium]], and [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]].

The two hip bones [[joints|joins]] at the [[pubic symphysis]] and together with the [[sacrum]] and [[coccyx]], the hip bone comprises the skeletal component of the [[pelvis]], the [[pelvic girdle]], which surrounds the [[pelvic cavity]]. The hip bone forms the primary connection between the bones of the [[lower limb]] and the [[axial skeleton]] at the [[sacroiliac joint]]. The hip bone also contains a large [[ball and socket joint]], the [[hip joint]], which connects the [[femur]] to the pelvis.<ref name=Bojsen>{{cite book |last=Bojsen-Møller |first=Finn  |last2=Simonsen |first2=Erik B. |last3=Tranum-Jensen |first3=Jørgen| year=2001 |title=Bevægeapparatets anatomi |edition=12th |language=Danish |trans_title=Anatomy of the Locomotive Apparatus | isbn =978-87-628-0307-7|pages=237-239 |accessdate=October 29, 2012}}</ref>

==Human anatomy==
The hip bone is formed by three bones; [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]], [[ischium]], and [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]].  At birth, these three component bones are separated by [[hyaline cartilage]]. By the end of [[puberty]] the three bones will have grown together. The fusion is usually complete by the age 25. The bones connect at the [[acetabulum]]. ''See [[Hip bone#Ossification|Ossification]] for further details''. The two hip bones [[joints|joins]] at the [[pubic symphysis]] and together with the [[sacrum]] and [[coccyx]], the hip bone comprises the skeletal component of the [[pelvis]]. The three bones of the hip joint joins each other in a Y-shaped portion of cartilage in the acetabulum.<ref name=Bojsen/>

===Ilium===
{{Main|Ilium (bone)}}
Ilium ([[plural]] Ilii) is the uppermost and largest bone. It makes up two-fifth of the acetabulum. It is divisible into two parts, the [[Body of ilium|body]] and the [[Wing of ilium|ala or wing of ilium]]; the separation is indicated on the top surface by a curved line, the [[Arcuate line of ilium|arcuate line]], and on the external surface by the margin of the acetabulum. The body of ilium forms the [[sacroiliac joint]] with the [[sacrum]]. The edge of the wing of ilium forms the S-shaped [[iliac crest]] which is easily located through the [[human skin|skin]]. The iliac crest show clear marks of the attachment of the three [[abdominal wall|abdominal wall muscles]].<ref name=Bojsen/>

===Ischium===
{{Main|Ischium}}
The ischium forms the lower and back part of the hip bone and is located below the ilium and behind the pubis. The ischium is the strongest of the three bones that forms the hip bone. It is divisible into three portions; [[Body of ischium|The body]], the [[Superior ramus of the ischium|superior ramus]] and the [[Inferior ramus of the ischium|inferior ramus]]. The body forms approximately one-third of the acetabulum.

The ischium forms a large swelling, the [[tuberosity of the ischium]], also referred to colloqially as the "sit bone". When sitting, the weight is frequently placed upon the ischial tuberosity. The [[gluteus maximus]] covers it in the upright posture, but leaves it free in the seated position.<ref name=Bojsen/>

===Pubis===
{{Main|Pubis (bone)}}
The pubic bone or pubis is the ventral and anterior of the three bones forming the hip bone. It is divisible into a [[Body of pubic bone|body]], a [[Superior pubic ramus|superior ramus]] and an [[Inferior pubic ramus|inferior ramus]]. The body forms one-fifth of the acetabulum. The body forms the wide, strong, medial and flat portion of the pubic bone which unite with the other pubic bone in the [[pubic symphysis]].<ref name=Bojsen/> The fibrocartilaginous pad which lies between the symphysial surfaces of the pubic bones, that secures the pubic symphysis, is called the interpubic disc.  

The superior pubic ramus is a part of the pubic bone which forms a portion of the [[obturator foramen]]. It extends from the body to the median plane where it articulates with its fellow of the opposite side. It is conveniently described in two portions; a medial flattened part and a narrow lateral [[prismoid]] portion.

The inferior pubic ramus is thin and flat. It passes laterally and downward from the medial end of the superior ramus. it becomes narrower as it descends and joins with the inferior ramus of the ischium below the obturator foramen.

===Muscle attachments===
Several muscles attaches to the hip bone including the [[Pelvic floor|internal muscles of the pelvic]], [[abdominal muscles]], [[Human back#Muscles of the back|back muscles]], all the [[gluteal muscles]], muscles of the [[lateral rotator group]], [[hamstrings|hamstring muscles]], two muscles from the [[Anterior compartment of thigh|anterior compartment of the thigh]] and even a single [[Shoulder#Muscles|shoulder muscle]].

'''Abdominal muscles'''
*The [[abdominal external oblique muscle]] attaches to the [[iliac crest]].
*The [[abdominal internal oblique muscle]] attaches to [[pecten pubis]].
*The [[transversus abdominis muscle]] attaches to the [[pubic crest]] and pecten pubis via a conjoint tendon

'''Back muscles'''
*The [[multifidus muscle]] in the sacral region attaches to the medial surface of [[posterior superior iliac spine]], the [[posterior sacroiliac ligaments]] and several places to the sacrum.

'''Gluteal muscles'''
*The [[gluteus maximus muscle]] arises from the [[posterior gluteal line]] of the inner upper ilium, and the rough portion of bone including the iliac crest, the fascia covering the [[gluteus medius]] ([[gluteal aponeurosis]]), as well as the sacrum, coccyx, the [[erector spinae]] ([[lumbodorsal fascia]]), the [[sacrotuberous ligament]].
*The [[gluteus medius muscle]]: originates on the outer surface of the ilium between the iliac crest and the posterior gluteal line above, and the [[anterior gluteal line]] below. The gluteus medius also originates from the gluteal aponeurosis that covers its outer surface.
*Gluteus minimus muscle originates between the anterior and [[inferior gluteal line]]s, and from the margin of the [[greater sciatic notch]].

'''Lateral rotator group'''
*The [[piriformis muscle]] originates from the superior margin of the [[greater sciatic notch]] (as well as the [[sacroiliac joint]] capsule and the [[sacrotuberous ligament]] and  part of the [[Vertebral column|spine]] and sacrum.
*The [[superior gemellus muscle]] arises from the outer surface of the [[ischial spine]]
*The [[obturator internus muscle]] arises from the inner surface of the antero-lateral wall of the hip bone, where it surrounds the greater part of the [[obturator foramen]], being attached to the inferior rami of the pubis and ischium, and at the side to the inner surface of the hip bone below and behind the [[pelvic brim]], reaching from the upper part of the [[greater sciatic foramen]] above and behind to the obturator foramen below and in front. It also arises from the pelvic surface of the [[obturator membrane]] except in the posterior part, from the [[tendinous arch]], and to a slight extent from the [[obturator fascia]], which covers the muscle.
*The [[inferior gemellus muscle]]arises from the upper part of the [[tuberosity of the ischium]], immediately below the groove for the obturator internus tendon.
*The [[obturator externus muscle]] arises from the margin of bone immediately around the medial side of the obturator foramen, from the rami of the pubis, and the inferior ramus of the ischium; it also arises from the medial two-thirds of the outer surface of the obturator membrane, and from the tendinous arch.

'''Hamstrings'''
*The long head [[biceps femoris]] arises from the lower and inner impression on the back part of the [[tuberosity of the ischium]], by a tendon common to it and the [[semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]], and from the lower part of the [[sacrotuberous ligament]];<ref name="Gray's">{{cite web
 |title=Gray's Anatomy |year=1918
 |url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/gray/subjects/subject/128#p478
}}</ref>
*The [[semitendinosus]] arises from the lower and medial impression on the tuberosity of the ischium, by a tendon common to it and the long head of the biceps femoris; it also arises from an [[aponeurosis]] which connects the adjacent surfaces of the two muscles to the extent of about 7.5 cm. from their origin.
*The [[semimembranosus]] arises from the lower and medial impression on the tuberosity of the ischium

'''Anterior compartment of thigh'''
*The [[rectus femoris muscle]] arises by two tendons: one, the anterior or straight, from the anterior inferior iliac spine; the other, the posterior or reflected, from a groove above the rim of the acetabulum.
*The [[sartorius muscle]] arises by tendinous fibres from the anterior superior iliac spine,

'''Shoulder muscles'''
*The [[latissimus dorsi muscle]] atteches to the iliac crest and severeal places on the [[Human vertebral column|spine]] and [[Rib|ribs]].

===Ossification===
[[File:Gray237.png|thumbnail|right|Plan of ossification of the hip bone. Left hip bone, external surface.]]
The hip bone is ossified from eight [[ossification center|centers]]: three primary —one each for the ilium, ischium, and pubis; and five secondary —one each for the [[iliac crest]], the [[anterior inferior spine]] (said to occur more frequently in the male than in the female), the tuberosity of the ischium, the pubic symphysis (more frequent in the female than in the male), and one or more for the Y-shaped piece at the bottom of the acetabulum. The centers appear in the following order: in the lower part of the ilium, immediately above the [[greater sciatic notch]], about the eighth or ninth week of fetal life; in the superior ramus of the ischium, about the third month; in the superior ramus of the pubis, between the fourth and fifth months. At birth, the three primary centers are quite separate, the crest, the bottom of the acetabulum, the ischial tuberosity, and the inferior rami of the ischium and pubis being still cartilaginous. By the seventh or eighth year, the inferior rami of the pubis and ischium are almost completely united by bone. About the thirteenth or fourteenth year, the three primary centers have extended their growth into the bottom of the acetabulum, and are there separated from each other by a Y-shaped portion of cartilage, which now presents traces of ossification, often by two or more centers. One of these, the os acetabuli, appears about the age of twelve, between the ilium and pubis, and fuses with them about the age of eighteen; it forms the pubic part of the acetabulum. The ilium and ischium then become joined, and lastly the pubis and ischium, through the intervention of this Y-shaped portion. At about the age of puberty, ossification takes place in each of the remaining portions, and they join with the rest of the bone between the twentieth and twenty-fifth years. Separate centers are frequently found for the pubic tubercle and the ischial spine, and for the crest and angle of the pubis.

==Evolution==
The hip bone first appears in fishes, where it consists of a simple, usually triangular bone, to which the [[pelvic fin]] articulates. The hip bones on each side usually connect with each other at the forward end, and are even solidly fused in [[lungfish]]es and [[shark]]s, but they never attach to the vertebral column.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 188–192|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>

In the early [[tetrapod]]s, this early hip bone evolved to become the ischium and pubis, while the ilium formed as a new structure, initially somewhat rod-like in form, but soon adding a larger bony blade. The acetabulum is already present at the point where the three bones meet. In these early forms, the connection with the vertebral column is not complete, with a small pair of ribs connecting the two structures; nonetheless the pelvis already forms the complete ring found in most subsequent forms.<ref name=VB/>

In practice, modern [[amphibian]]s and [[reptile]]s have substantially modified this ancestral structure, based on their varied forms and lifestyles. The obturator foramen is generally very small in such animals, although most reptiles do possess a large gap between the pubis and ischium, referred to as the ''thyroid fenestra'', which presents a similar appearance to the obturator foramen in mammals. In [[bird]]s, the pubic symphysis is present only in the [[ostrich]], and the two hip bones are usually widely separated, making it easier to lay large eggs.<ref name=VB/>

In [[therapsid]]s, the hip bone came to rotate counter-clockwise, relatives to its position in reptiles, so that the ilium moved forward, and the pubis and ischium moved to the rear. The same pattern is seen in all modern mammals, and the thyroid fenestra and obturator foramen have merged to form a single space. The ilium is typically narrow and triangular in mammals, but is much larger in [[ungulate]]s and [[human]]s, in which it anchors powerful gluteal muscles. Monotremes and marsupials also possess a fourth pair of bones, the '''prepubes''' or "marsupial bones", which extend forward from the pubes, and help to support the abdominal muscles and, in marsupials, the pouch. In placentral mammals, the pelvis as a whole is generally wider in females than in males, to allow for the birth of the young.<ref name=VB/>

==Fractures==
{{Main|Pelvic fracture}}
Fractures of the hip bone are termed [[pelvic fracture]]s, and should not be confused with [[hip fracture]]s, which are actually [[femoral fracture]]<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hip+fracture TheFreeDictionary > hip fracture] Citing: McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine. Copyright 2002</ref> that occur in the [[proximal]] end of the [[femur]].
