'''Gabapentin''' ('''Neurontin''') is a pharmaceutical drug, specifically a [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] [[Analogue (chemistry)|analog]].  It was originally developed to treat [[epilepsy]], and currently is also used to relieve [[neuropathic pain]]. There are, however, concerns regarding the quality of the trials conducted for a number of conditions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vedula|first=SS|coauthors=Bero L; Scherer RW; Dickersin K|title=Outcome reporting in industry-sponsored trials of gabapentin for off-label use |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]| year = 2009 | month = November|volume=361|issue=20|pages=1963–71|pmid=19907043|doi=10.1056/NEJMsa0906126}}</ref>

===Negative===
Gabapentin has been prescribed in the mental health context. Numerous trials show that it is not effective alone as a [[mood stabilizer|mood-stabilizing]] treatment for [[bipolar disorder]] and so has no therapeutic advantage in having fewer side-effects over better established bipolar drugs such as [[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]] and [[valproic acid]]. Gabapentin is useful in the treatment of [[anxiety]] associated with bipolar disorder, but has limited usefulness in disorders such as [[social anxiety disorder]] and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], in [[treatment-resistant depression]], and for [[insomnia]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chouinard|first=G|year=2006|month=May|title=The search for new off-label indications for antidepressant, antianxiety, antipsychotic and anticonvulsant drugs|url=|journal=J Psychiatry Neurosci|issn=1180-4882|volume=31|issue=3|pages=168–176|pmid=16699602|pmc=1449873}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| last=Frye|first=MA |coauthors=Ketter TA; Kimbrell TA; Dunn RT; Speer AM; Osuch EA; Luckenbaugh DA; Cora-Ocatelli G; Leverich GS; Post RM |title=A placebo-controlled study of lamotrigine and gabapentin monotherapy in refractory mood disorders |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology|volume=20|issue=6|pages=607–14|year=2000 | month = December |doi=10.1097/00004714-200012000-00004| pmid=11106131}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Gabapentin's most common side effects in adult patients include dizziness, fatigue, weight gain, drowsiness, and [[peripheral edema]] (swelling of extremities);<ref name="Neurontin label" /> these mainly occur at higher doses in the elderly. Also, in children 3 to 12 years of age, researchers observed susceptibility to mild-to-moderate mood swings, hostility, concentration problems, and hyperactivity. Though rare, the literature reports several cases of [[hepatotoxicity]].<ref>

An increase in formation of [[adenocarcinoma]]s was observed in rats during preclinical trials; however, the clinical significance of these results remains undetermined. Gabapentin is also known to induce pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas in rats through an unknown mechanism, perhaps by stimulation of DNA synthesis; these tumors did not affect the lifespan of the rats and did not [[metastasize]].<ref name="FDA">[http://www.drugs.com/pro/gabapentin.html Gabapentin Official FDA information, side effects and uses<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Gabapentin should not be discontinued abruptly after long term use.

==Pharmacology==
Gabapentin was initially synthesized to mimic the [[chemical structure]] of the [[neurotransmitter]] gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), but is not believed to act on the same brain receptors. The mechanism of action that leads to its rapid{{dubious|date=February 2013}} [[analgesic]] effect is simply unknown.

Some of its activity may involve interaction with [[voltage-gated calcium channels]]. Gabapentin binds to the α2δ subunit ([[CACNA2D1|1]] and [[CACNA2D2|2]]) and has been found to reduce calcium currents after chronic but not acute application via an effect on trafficking<ref name="pmid18299583">{{cite journal | last1 = Hendrich | first1 = J | last2 = Van Minh | first2 = AT | last3 = Heblich | first3 = F | last4 = Nieto-Rostro | first4 = M | last5 = Watschinger | first5 = K | last6 = Striessnig | first6 = J | last7 = Wratten | first7 = J | last8 = Davies | first8 = A | last9 = Dolphin | first9 = AC |title=Pharmacological disruption of calcium channel trafficking by the alpha2delta ligand gabapentin |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=105 |issue=9 |pages=3628–33 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18299583 |pmc=2265195 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0708930105 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/9/3628.full.pdf | bibcode=2008PNAS..105.3628H}}</ref> of voltage-dependent calcium channels in the [[central nervous system]].<ref name="pmid17403543">{{cite journal | last1 = Davies | first1 = A | last2 = Hendrich | first2 = J | last3 = Van Minh | first3 = AT | last4 = Wratten | first4 = J | last5 = Douglas | first5 = L | last6 = Dolphin | first6 = AC | title = Functional biology of the alpha(2)delta subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels | journal = Trends Pharmacol Sci | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 220–8 | year = 2007 | month = May | pmid = 17403543 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2007.03.005 }}</ref> Another possible [[mechanism of action]], reported by Ben Barres and colleagues in ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]]'' in 2009, is that gabapentin halts the formation of new synapses.<ref>{{cite journal

Compared to gabapentin, pregabalin is more potent, absorbs faster and has greater bioavailability. Higher potency means that less of the medication is required for the same effect.

==Society and culture==

===Sales===
Gabapentin is best known under the brand name Neurontin manufactured by [[Pfizer]] subsidiary [[Parke-Davis]]. A Pfizer subsidiary named Greenstone markets generic gabapentin.

In December 2004 the FDA granted final approval to a generic equivalent to Neurontin made by the Israeli firm [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]].

Neurontin is one of Pfizer's best-selling drugs, and was one of the 50 most-prescribed [[Medication|drugs]] in the [[United States]] in 2003. However, Pfizer has come under heavy criticism and serious litigation for its marketing of Neurontin. They face allagations that, behind the scenes, [[Parke-Davis]] marketed the drug for at least a dozen supposed uses that the [[David Franklin (scientist)|FDA]] had not approved.<ref name="pmid16908923">

===FDA approval===
Gabapentin was originally approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1994, for use as an adjunctive medication to control [[focal seizure|partial seizures]] (effective when added to other antiseizure drugs). In 2002, an [[indication (medicine)|indication]] was added for treating [[postherpetic neuralgia]] (neuropathic pain following [[shingles]]).<ref>Pfizer: Product Monograph{{PDF|[http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/download/uspi_neurontin.pdf Neurontin]|251&nbsp;KB}} Retrieved 14 August 2006</ref>

===Legal action===
Numerous cases have been brought against the makers of Neurontin, with convictions arising not only for the illegal promotion of off-label uses. In the first such case, [[Franklin v. Parke-Davis]], whistleblower [[David Franklin (scientist)|David Franklin]] sued under the [[False Claims Act]] on behalf of the Federal Government, and secured a $430 million settlement, of which the majority was incurred as fines and penalties in respect of guilty [[plea]]s to two [[felony]] counts of misbranding drugs under the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], some awarded for customer restitution schemes, and around $24m awarded personally to Franklin in recognition of his importance in revealing the matter.<ref name="justice">http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2004/May/04_civ_322.htm</ref> 

Much of the popular use of Neurontin among physicians stems from the widespread illicit marketing that Pfizer was convicted of, which was communicated via promotional messages through advisory boards, consultants' meetings, and accredited continuing medical education events posing as independent third-party organizations, co-opting opinion leaders, educational enterprises and academia in their marketing campaign.<ref name="Steinman 284–293">{{cite journal|last=Steinman|first=MA|coauthors=Bero LA; Chren MM; Landefeld CS |title=Narrative review: the promotion of gabapentin: an analysis of internal industry documents |journal=[[Annals of Internal Medicine]] | year = 2006 | month = August |volume=145|issue=4|pages=284–293 |pmid=16908919}}</ref> As part of a case<ref>CIVIL ACTION NO. 04-cv-10739-PBS{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref> brought by Kaiser Foundation Health Plan against Pfizer, it was noted that "The general neuropathic pain indication cannot be granted for Neurontin based on the clinical trials in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)."<ref>{{cite journal|title=Saris Decision|url=http://lieffcabraser.com/media/pnc/0/media.750.pdf|author1=<Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.>}}</ref>

While it is often prescribed [[off-label use|off-label]] (that is, at the discretion of a physician) for various conditions, this may partially stem from the illicit marketing mentioned above.<ref name="Steinman 284–293"/>

In addition, the FDA black box warning states: "Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Neurontin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication."<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Label_ApprovalHistory{{verify source|date=December 2011}}</ref>

Despite this controversy, many psychiatrists continue to prescribe it for a variety of off-label purposes. Oftentimes, it is tried as an alternative treatment when patients are unable to tolerate the side effects of more proven mood stabilizers such as lithium. More frequently, it is prescribed on a speculative basis as an auxiliary treatment, when single-drug therapy has consistently failed to yield sufficient positive results.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Baldessarini | first = Ross J | coauthors = Leahy L; Arcona S; Gause D; Zhang W; Hennen J | title = Patterns of Psychotropic Drug Prescription for U.S. Patients With Diagnoses of Bipolar Disorders | journal = Psychiatric Services | issue = 1 |pages = 85–91 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17215417 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ps.58.1.85 | volume = 58 | url = http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/data/Journals/PSS/3790/07ps85.pdf }}</ref>

====''Franklin v. Pfizer'' case====
{{main|Franklin v. Parke-Davis}}

By some estimates, ''[[Off-label use|off-label]]'' prescriptions account for roughly 90&nbsp;percent of Neurontin sales.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/05/14/BUGKK6L0LB1.DTL |title=Huge penalty in drug fraud, Pfizer settles felony case in Neurontin off-label promotion |work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2004-05-14|page=C-1 | first=Bernadette | last=Tansey}}</ref>
While off-label prescriptions are common for a number of drugs and are perfectly legal (if not always appropriate), marketing of off-label uses of a drug is strictly illegal.<ref name="pmid16908923" /> In 2004, Warner-Lambert agreed to plead guilty and pay $430&nbsp;million in fines to settle civil and criminal charges regarding the illegal marketing of Neurontin for off-label purposes, and further legal action is pending. The 2004 settlement was [[List of Largest Pharmaceutical Settlements|one of the largest]] in U.S. history, and the [[List of off-label promotion pharmaceutical settlements|first off-label promotion case]] brought successfully under the False Claims Act. The courts of New York State, for example, have refused to certify a class of injured parties who took Neurontin for off-label use, finding that they had failed to state that they had any injury.<ref>[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/3dseries/2007/2007_05813.htm "Baron v Pfizer, Inc."] 2007 NY Slip Op 05813 [42 AD3d 627].

The [[University of California, San Francisco]] (UCSF) has archived<ref>[http://dida.library.ucsf.edu Drug Industry Document Archive]</ref> and studied<ref>[http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/145/4/284 Narrative Review: The Promotion of Gabapentin: An Analysis of Internal Industry Documents – Steinman et al. 145 (4): 284 – Annals of Internal Medicine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the documents made public by this case, which opens a unique window into the illegal promotion and marketing of pharmaceuticals. However, Pfizer maintains that the illegal activity originated in 1996, well before it acquired [[Parke-Davis]] (through its acquisition of [[Warner-Lambert]]) in 2000. Several lawsuits are underway after people who had been prescribed gabapentin for off-label treatment of bipolar disorder later attempted or committed [[suicide]].

===Recreational use===

Although gabapentin is not a controlled substance, it does produce psychoactive effects that cause it to have potential for recreational use. Even in low doses, gabapentin causes sensations of reduced acute pain and reduced anxiety. Larger doses can cause the user to become numb and even fully insensate. Tolerance to gabapentin occurs extremely rapidly with recreational use, with the user often needing to double the dosage within a day or two of misuse. Although it is widely regarded as having little or no potential for misuse, it is often a misused drug in Canadian Northern communities{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} and among inmates in California State prisons.<ref name="bc_dpic">{{cite web |url=http://dpic.org/article/professional/gabapentin-abuse |author=Janet Webb |title=Gabapentin – another drug of misuse?}}</ref> However, [[Pregabalin]], a subsequent Pfizer spin-off, is a controlled substance under [[Schedule V (US)|Schedule V]] of the United States' [[Controlled Substances Act]].

'''Neurocognitive effects with other interactions'''

''Alcohol dependence''

While symptoms of abrupt gabapentin withdrawal are many, a study has combined gabapentin and flumazenil—a benzodiazepine antagonist—to measure cognitive performance on individuals in the beginning stages of alcohol withdrawal. The research impetus came from the GABA and glutamate signaling that occurs during alcohol withdrawal. The study observed for improvement of response inhibitions between subjects that had received treatment versus a group receiving a placebo. Over 60 alcohol-dependent participants were evaluated.
The results were moderate; the gabapentin and flumazenil treatment slightly improved response inhibition task during the early phases of abstinence, and this corresponds to many self-testimonials. However the quality of the overall impact was mixed and the medication cannot be said to improve avoidance of alcoholic relapse; however it has the potential to subdue early withdrawal discomforts when combined with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist.<ref name="pmid21631542">{{cite journal

''Cocaine''

Frequently mentioned online in drug-experience sharing websites, Gabapentin has been considered for reducing cocaine use or assisting in cocaine withdrawal because of its GABAergic feedback properties. One study chose nine individuals with cocaine withdrawal symptoms from a clinical setting. Gabapentin presence was tested over a 24-week trial; the study concluded that Gabapentin may be a useful medicine for reducing cocaine usage in addicted patients, especially during the early weeks of any attempt to cease cocaine usage.<ref name="pmid14744174">{{cite journal

===Brand names===

A number of brand names include: Neurostil, Neurontin, Fanatrex, Gabarone, Gralise, Nupentin, Gabrion.<ref>http://thepharmaguide.com/content/view/5336/31/.</ref>

==Veterinary use==
Gabapentin is also used for some animal treatments, but formulations (especially liquid forms) for human use may contain the sweetener [[Xylitol]], which is toxic to dogs—so veterinary use of the human version requires caution.<ref>{{cite web |author=Barbara Forney |title=Gabapentin for Veterinary Use |url=http://www.wedgewoodpetrx.com/learning-center/professional-monographs/gabapentin-for-veterinary-use.html}}</ref>
