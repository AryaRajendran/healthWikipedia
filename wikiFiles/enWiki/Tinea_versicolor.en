==Symptoms==
The symptoms of this condition include:
* Generally oval or irregularly-shaped spots of {{convert|1/4|to|1|in|cm|1}} in diameter, often merging to form a larger patch
* Occasional fine scaling of the skin producing a very superficial ash-like scale
* Pale, dark tan, or pink in color, with a reddish undertone that can darken when the patient is overheated, such as in a hot shower or during/after exercise. Tanning typically makes the affected areas contrast more starkly with the surrounding skin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tineaversicolor.us/whattoavoid.html |title=What to Avoid While Treating Tinea Versicolor |work= |accessdate=2013-01-05}}</ref>
* They may be mildly itchy.
* Sharp border <ref name="dermnetnz.org">http://www.dermnetnz.org/fungal/pityriasis-versicolor.html</ref>
* Pityriasis versicolor is more common in hot, humid climates or in those who sweat heavily, so it may recur each summer.<ref name="dermnetnz.org"/>
* Sometimes severe "pin-prick" itching in the affected areas; usually when the person's body temperature is elevated by exercise or a hot/warm environment, but the person hasn't started sweating yet. Once sweating begins the "pin-prick" itching subsides.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}<!-- dubious, ?OR - needs good 2nd source citation else remove -->

These spots commonly affect the [[back]], [[underarm]], [[upper arm]], [[chest]], lower legs, and [[neck]]. Occasionally it can also be present on the [[face]]. The yeasts can often be seen under the microscope within the lesions and typically have a so-called "spaghetti and meat ball appearance"<ref name="urlAdolescent Health Curriculum - Medical Problems - Dermatology - Papulosquamous Lesions (B4)">{{cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/student-affairs/Health_Center/adolhealth/content/b4derm4.html |title=Adolescent Health Curriculum - Medical Problems - Dermatology - Papulosquamous Lesions (B4) |work= |accessdate=2008-12-10}}</ref> as the round yeasts produce filaments.

In people with dark skin tones, pigmentary changes such as [[hypopigmentation]] (loss of color) are common, while in those with lighter skin color, [[hyperpigmentation]] (increase in skin color) are more common. These discolorations have led to the term "sun fungus".<ref name="urlTioconazole (Topical Route) - MayoClinic.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/drug-information/DR601345 |title=Tioconazole (Topical Route) - MayoClinic.com |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-12-10}}</ref>

==Prevalence==
Tinea versicolor is a common condition. It is estimated that 2 to 8% of the population of the [[United States]] has it. This skin disease commonly affects [[adolescent]]s and young adults, especially in warm and humid climates. It is thought that the yeast feeds on skin oils ([[lipid]]s) as well as dead skin cells. Infections are more common in people who have [[Seborrhoeic dermatitis|seborrheic dermatitis]], [[dandruff]], and [[hyperhidrosis]].<ref name="Weedon, D 2002"/>

==Diagnosis==
Tinea versicolor may be diagnosed by a [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) preparation and lesions may fluoresce copper-orange when exposed to [[Wood's lamp]].<ref name="Athlete">{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21771922|last1=Likness|first1=LP|title=Common dermatologic infections in athletes and return-to-play guidelines.|journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association|year=2011|month=June|volume=111|issue=6|pages=373-379|pmid=21771922}}</ref> 
The differential diagnosis for Tinea versicolor infection includes:
*[[Pityriasis alba]]
*[[Pityriasis rosea]]
*[[Seborrheic dermatitis]]
*[[Erythrasma]]
*[[Vitiligo]]
*[[Leprosy]]
*[[Syphilis]]
*Post-inflammatory [[hypopigmentation]]<ref>http://dermind.tripod.com/tv.htm</ref>

==Treatment==

Treatments for tinea versicolor include:
* Tinaderm ([[Tolnaftate]] topical solution) is a very effective lotion. Its effect is moderately long lasting. This is a water-soluble lotion and is externally applied on the affected parts of skin, preferably during night hours. Its composition is 10&nbsp;mg of [[Tolnaftate]] USP in [[Polyethylene]] and [[Glycol]] 400 USP NF base q.s.

* [[Topical]] [[Antifungal drug|antifungal medications]] containing 2.5% [[selenium sulfide]] (Selsun Extra Strength shampoo) are often recommended.<ref name="Athlete"/>  [[Selsun Blue]] works for some people, but not all, because it only contains 1% selenium sulfide.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Preparations containing more than 1% selenium sulfide are considered prescription strength.  Products that contain 1% selenium sulfide include [ZunSpot] medicated cream.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001465.htm#Treatment MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Tinea versicolor]</ref> [[Ketoconazole]] ([[Nizoral]] ointment and shampoo) is another treatment.  It is normally applied to dry skin and washed off after 10 minutes, repeated daily for 2 weeks. [[Ciclopirox]] (Ciclopirox olamine) is an alternative treatment to [[ketoconazole]] as it suppresses growth of the yeast Malassezia furfur. Initial results show similar efficacy to [[ketoconazole]] with a relative increase in subjective symptom relief due to its inherent anti-inflammatory properties.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ratnavel RC, Squire RA, Boorman GC |title=Clinical efficacies of shampoos containing ciclopirox olamine (1.5%) and [[ketoconazole]] (2.0%) in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis |journal=J Dermatolog Treat |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=88–96 |year=2007 |pmid=17520465 |doi=10.1080/16537150601092944}}</ref> Other topical antifungal agents such as [[clotrimazole]], [[miconazole]] or  [[terbinafine]] can lessen symptoms in some patients{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. Additionally, [[hydrogen peroxide]] has been known to lessen symptoms, and on certain occasions, remove the problem, although permanent scarring has occurred with this treatment in some sufferers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Clotrimazole (1%) is also used combined with selenium sulfide (2.5%) (Candid-TV).

* Oral antifungal [[Prescription drug|prescription-only medication]]s include 400&nbsp;mg of [[ketoconazole]] or [[fluconazole]] in a single dose, or [[ketoconazole]] 200&nbsp;mg daily for 7 days, or [[itraconazole]]<ref name="pmid11790169">{{cite journal |author=Faergemann J, Gupta AK, Al Mofadi A, Abanami A, Shareaah AA, Marynissen G |title=Efficacy of itraconazole in the prophylactic treatment of pityriasis (tinea) versicolor |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=138 |issue=1 |pages=69–73 |year=2002 |month=January |pmid=11790169 |doi= 10.1001/archderm.138.1.69|url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11790169}}</ref><ref name="pmid17664760">{{cite journal |author=Mohanty J, Sethi J, Sharma MK |title=Efficacy of itraconazole in the treatment of tinea versicolor |journal=Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol |volume=67 |issue=5 |pages=240–1 |year=2001 |pmid=17664760 |doi= |url=http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2001;volume=67;issue=5;spage=240;epage=241;aulast=Mohanty}}</ref> 400&nbsp;mg daily for 3–7 days. The single-dose regimens, or [http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/pulse+therapy pulse therapy] regimes, can be made more effective by having the patient exercise 1–2 hours after the dose, to induce sweating. The sweat is allowed to evaporate, and showering is delayed for a day, leaving a film of the medication on the skin.<ref>[http://www.fpnotebook.com/ID/Pharm/Ktcnzl.htm Ketoconazole<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

* Some success with ''[[Senna alata]]'' has been reported.<ref name="pmid8046939">{{cite journal |author=Damodaran S, Venkataraman S |title=A study on the therapeutic efficacy of Cassia alata, Linn. leaf extract against Pityriasis versicolor |journal=J Ethnopharmacol |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=19–23 |year=1994 |month=March |pmid=8046939 |doi= 10.1016/0378-8741(94)90018-3|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0378-8741(94)90018-3}}</ref>

* Recurrence is common and may be reduced by intermittent application of topical anti-fungal agents like tea tree oil{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} or selenium sulfide.
