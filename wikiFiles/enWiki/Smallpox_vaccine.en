The '''smallpox vaccine''' was the first successful [[vaccine]] to be developed. The process of vaccination was first publicised by [[Edward Jenner]] in 1796, who acted upon his observation that milkmaids who caught the [[cowpox]] virus did not catch [[smallpox]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stewart AJ, Devlin PM |title=The history of the smallpox vaccine |journal=J.

==History before vaccination==
[[Image:Variolation vial India.jpg|thumb|right|upright|An Indian variolation vial containing live smallpox virus.]]

Before the introduction of a vaccine, the mortality of the severe form of smallpox—variola major—was very high. Historical records show a method of [[Artificial induction of immunity|inducing immunity]] was already known. A process called [[inoculation]], also known as [[Wiktionary:insufflation|insufflation]] or "[[variolation]]" was practiced in [[India]] as early as 1000 BC.<ref name=Bourzac_2002>{{cite journal | author = Bourzac K| title = Smallpox: Historical Review of a Potential Bioterrorist Tool | journal = Journal of Young Investigators | year = 2002 | volume = 6 | issue = 3|pages = –|url= http://www.jyi.org/volumes/volume6/issue3/features/bourzac.html| doi = | last2 = Bernoulli | first2 = D}}</ref> This interpretation is disputed, however; other investigators contend the ancient [[Sanskrit]] medical texts of India do not describe these techniques.<ref>{{cite book | author = Wujastyk D | year=1995 | chapter=Medicine in India | title=Oriental Medicine: An Illustrated Guide to the Asian Arts of Healing | pages= 19–38. | location=London | publisher=Serindia Publications | isbn=0-906026-36-9}}</ref> The first clear reference to smallpox inoculation was made by the [[China|Chinese]] author Wan Quan (1499–1582) in his ''Douzhen xinfa'' (痘疹心法) published in 1549.<ref>{{cite book | author=Needham J| year=1999 | title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 6, Biology and Biological Technology | chapter= Part 6, Medicine | location=Cambridge|publisher= Cambridge University Press | pages=134}}</ref> Inoculation for smallpox does not appear to have been widespread in China until the reign era of the [[Longqing Emperor]] (r. 1567–1572) during the [[Ming Dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book | author= Temple R | year=1986 | title=The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention | location=New York | publisher= Simon and Schuster | isbn=0-671-62028-2| pages=137}}</ref> In China, powdered smallpox scabs were blown up the noses of the healthy. The patients would then develop a mild case of the disease and from then on were immune to it. The technique did have a 0.5-2.0% mortality rate, but that was considerably less than the 20-30% mortality rate of the disease itself.

Variolation was also practiced throughout the latter half of the 17th century by physicians in [[Turkey]], [[Persia]], and [[Africa]]. In 1714 and 1716, two reports of the [[Ottoman Empire]] Turkish method of inoculation were made to the [[Royal Society]] in [[England]], by Emmanuel Timoni, a doctor affiliated with the British Embassy in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]],<ref name=Behbehani_1983>{{cite journal |author=Behbehani AM |title=The smallpox story: life and death of an old disease |journal=Microbiol Rev |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=455–509 |year=1983 |pmid=6319980 |doi= |pmc=281588 |last2=Blower |first2=Sally}}</ref> and [[Giacomo Pylarini]]. Lady [[Mary Wortley Montagu]], wife of the British ambassador to Ottoman Constantinople, is widely credited with introducing the process to Great Britain in 1721.

Doctors told them it was a dangerous procedure, so they decided to try it on other people first. The test subjects they used were condemned prisoners.  The doctors inoculated the prisoners and all of them recovered in a few weeks. So assured, the British royal family inoculated themselves and reassured the English people that it was safe.

Stimulated by a severe epidemic, variolation was first employed in North America in 1721. The practice had been known in Boston since 1706, when [[Cotton Mather]] (of [[Salem witch trial]] fame) discovered his slave, Onesimus had been inoculated while still in Africa, and many slaves imported to Boston had also received inoculations.<ref name=Willoughby_2004>{{cite web | title= BLACK HISTORY MONTH II: Why Wasn't I Taught That? | author=Willoughby B | work=Tolerance in the News | url=http://www.tolerance.org/news/article_tol.jsp?id=942 | date=12 February 2004| accessdate=4 December 2008}}</ref> The practice was, at first, widely criticized.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Open Collections Program: Contagion, The Boston Smallpox Epidemic, 1721 | accessdate = 27 August 2008 | url = http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/contagion/smallpox.html }}</ref> However, a limited trial showed six deaths occurred out of 244 who were vaccinated (2.5%), while 844 out of 5980 died of natural disease, and the process was widely adopted throughout the colonies.<ref name= Fenner>{{cite book |author=Fenner, Frank |title=Smallpox and Its Eradication (History of International Public Health, No. 6) |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |year=1988 |isbn=92-4-156110-6 }}</ref><!-- By 1777, [[George Washington]], who initially hesitated to have his [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] troops inoculated during a smallpox outbreak, wrote, "should We inoculate generally, the Enemy, knowing it, will certainly take Advantage of our Situation;”, and eventually ordered mandatory inoculation of all troops and recruits who had not had the disease.<ref>{{cite book |author=Grizzard FE, Washington G, Chase PD, Twohig D |title= George Washington to Major General Horatio Gates, 5–6 February 1777.

The inoculation technique was documented as having a mortality rate of only one in a thousand. Two years after Kennedy's description appeared, March 1718, Dr. [[Charles Maitland (physician)|Charles Maitland]] successfully inoculated the five-year-old son of the British ambassador to the Turkish court under orders from the ambassador's wife [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]],  who four years later introduced the practice to England.<ref>{{cite book | author = Robertson, Patrick | title = The book of firsts | publisher = C.

An account from letter by Lady [[Mary Wortley Montagu]] to Sarah Chiswell, dated 1 April 1717, from the Turkish Embassy describes this treatment:
<blockquote>The small-pox so fatal and so general amongst us is here entirely harmless by the invention of ingrafting (which is the term they give it). There is a set of old women who make it their business to perform the operation. Every autumn in the month of September, when the great heat is abated, people send to one another to know if any of their family has a mind to have the small-pox. They make parties for this purpose, and when they are met (commonly fifteen or sixteen together) the old woman comes with a nutshell full of the matter of the best sort of small-pox and asks what veins you please to have opened. She immediately rips open that you offer to her with a large needle (which gives you no more pain than a common scratch) and puts into the vein as much venom as can lye upon the head of her needle, and after binds up the little wound with a hollow bit of shell, and in this manner opens four or five veins. . . . The children or young patients play together all the rest of the day and are in perfect health till the eighth. Then the fever begins to seize them and they keep their beds two days, very seldom three. They have very rarely above twenty or thirty in their faces, which never mark, and in eight days time they are as well as before the illness. . . . There is no example of any one that has died in it, and you may believe I am very well satisfied of the safety of the experiment since I intend to try it on my dear little son. I am patriot enough to take pains to bring this useful invention into fashion in England, and I should not fail to write to some of our doctors very particularly about it if I knew any one of them that I thought had virtue enough to destroy such a considerable branch of their revenue for the good of mankind, but that distemper is too beneficial to them not to expose to all their resentment the hardy wight that should undertake to put an end to it. Perhaps if I live to return I may, however, have courage to war with them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ic.arizona.edu/ic/mcbride/ws200/montltrs.htm |title=Montagu, Turkish Embassy Letters |accessdate=4 December 2008}}</ref></blockquote>

== Early vaccination ==
[[Image:The cow pock.jpg|thumb|right|An 1802 cartoon depicting the early controversy surrounding Jenner's vaccination theory]]

In the early empirical days of vaccination, before [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur's]] work on establishing a [[germ theory]] and [[Joseph_Lister,_1st_Baron_Lister|Lister's]] on antisepsis and asepsis, there was considerable cross-infection.  One of the early vaccinators is thought to have contaminated the cowpox matter—the vaccine—with smallpox matter (he worked in a smallpox hospital) and this essentially produced variolation.  Other vaccine material was not reliably derived from cowpox, but from other skin eruptions of cattle.<ref>http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/london2001/august2001/18aug2001c/</ref>  In modern times, an effective scientific model and controlled production were important in reducing these causes of apparent failure or iatrogenic illness.

During the earlier days of empirical experimentation in 1758, American [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] died from a smallpox inoculation.
Some of the earliest [[statistics|statistical]] and [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies were performed by [[James Jurin]] in 1727 and [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1766.<ref name="pmid15334536">{{cite journal | author = Blower S, Bernoulli D | title = An attempt at a new analysis of the mortality caused by smallpox and of the advantages of inoculation to prevent it. 1766 | journal = Rev.

Fewster was a contemporary and friend of Jenner. Dr. Rolph, another Gloucestershire physician, stated that all experienced physicians of the time were aware of this.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

At the age of 13, Jenner was apprenticed to Dr. Ludlow in [[Sodbury]]. He observed that people who caught cowpox while working with cattle were known not to catch smallpox.  He assumed a causal connection. The idea was not taken up by Dr. Ludlow at that time.  After Jenner returned from medical school in London, a smallpox epidemic struck his home town of [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], England. He advised the local cattle workers to be inoculated. The farmers told him that cowpox prevented smallpox. This confirmed his childhood suspicion, and he studied cowpox further, presenting a paper on it to his local medical society.

Perhaps there was already an informal public understanding of some connection between disease resistance and working with cattle.  The "beautiful [[milkmaid]]” seems to have been a frequent image in the art and literature of this period. But we know for a fact: In the years following 1770, at least six people in England and Germany (Sevel, Jensen, [[Benjamin Jesty|Jesty]] 1774, Rendall, Plett 1791), tested successfully the possibility of using the cowpox vaccine as an immunization for smallpox in humans. In 1796, [[Sarah Nelmes]], a local milkmaid, contracted cowpox and went to Jenner for treatment. Jenner took the opportunity to test his theory.  He inoculated James Phipps, the eight-year-old son of his gardener, not with smallpox, but with cowpox.  After an extremely weak bout of cowpox, James recovered. Jenner then tried to infect James with smallpox, but nothing happened—the boy was immune to smallpox.

Jenner reported his observations to the Royal Society.  Further work was suggested, and Jenner published a series of 23 cases, including his son Edward, where none suffered severely from smallpox<!-- did any contract it at all? -->. Two years later, a society to oppose vaccination had been established in Boston, Massachusetts{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} — an indication of rapid spread and deep interest. By 1800, Jenner's work had been published in all of the major European languages. The process was performed all over Europe and the United States. The death rate was close to zero with the process, which became known as [[vaccination]] (from the Latin ''vacca'' for cow), and was continued to around 1974 in the UK.  Due to the development of the smallpox [[vaccine]], the disease was officially [[eradication of infectious diseases|eradicated]] in 1979.
[[File:Real Expedición Filantrópica de la Vacuna 01.svg|thumb|250px|right|Expedition by Balmis and his collaborators to America]]
The [[Balmis Expedition]] (1803) carried the vaccine to Spanish America, the [[Philippines]], and China under commission of the Spanish Crown.

Some years before Dr Jenner, [[Benjamin Jesty]], a [[farmer]] at [[Yetminster]] in [[Dorset]] (he later moved to and is buried at [[Worth Matravers]]), is recorded as observing the two milkmaids living with his family to have been immune to smallpox and then inoculating his family with cowpox to protect them from smallpox. This was done in 1774 and can be found with Crookshank's History and Pathology of Vaccination, London 1889, vol. 1, p.&nbsp;110ff. But the question of who first initiated smallpox inoculation/vaccination can not be answered properly, as there is in the sources the exact date and time only for the predecessor Plett (1791), but not for Sevel, Jensen and Rendall.

[[Leslie Collier]] developed a freeze-drying method to produce a more heat-stable smallpox vaccine in the late 1940s.<ref>{{Cite journal | issn = 0022-1724 | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 76-101 | last = Collier | first = L H | title = The development of a stable smallpox vaccine | journal = The Journal of hygiene | year = 1955 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | title = Professor Leslie Collier | work = The Telegraph | accessdate = 2 May 2013 | date = 22 March 2011 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8399116/Professor-Leslie-Collier.html }}</ref> Collier added a key component, [[Peptide#Peptide classes|peptone]], a soluble protein, to the process. This protected the virus, enabling the production of a heat-stable vaccine in powdered form. Previously, smallpox vaccines would become ineffective after one to two days at ambient temperature.

The development of his vaccine production method played a large role in enabling the [[World Health Organization]] to initiate its global smallpox eradication campaign in 1967.

== Eradication ==
[[Image:Poster for vaccination against smallpox.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Smallpox eradication promotional poster]]
{{main|Smallpox#Eradication}}
By 1977, smallpox, long considered to be the most deadly and persistent human [[pathogenic disease]], was eradicated by the [[World Health Organization]].  This was accomplished through a massive, worldwide outbreak search and [[vaccination]] program. However, the [[Smallpox|variola]] virus was not completely exterminated with the disease it caused. Three known repositories of the virus were left, one in Birmingham, England, which was later destroyed after an accidental escape from containment caused the death of [[Janet Parker]], and two still remaining at the [[Centers for Disease Control]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] and the [[State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology]] (VECTOR) in [[Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Oblast|Koltsovo, Russia]].  Each of those States reports that the repositories are retained for possible anti[[biological warfare|bioweaponry]] research and against the possibility that some obscure reservoir of natural smallpox may be discovered in the future.

== Post-eradication vaccination ==
[[Image:Smallpoxday10.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Smallpox vaccination lesion, ten days after vaccination.]]

The vaccine consists of the virus which causes the related, yet far milder, [[cowpox]] disease; this virus is named [[vaccinia]] (the term '''[[vaccine]]''' is derived from it), from the Latin ''vacca'' which means [[cow]]. This vaccine has functional viruses in it which improves its effectiveness, but causes serious complications for people with impaired [[immune system]]s (for example [[chemotherapy]] and [[AIDS]] patients, and people with [[eczema]]), and is not yet considered safe for pregnant women. A woman planning on conceiving within one month should not receive the smallpox immunization until after the pregnancy. In the event of an outbreak, the woman should delay pregnancy if possible. A small, yet significant, percentage of healthy individuals also suffer adverse side effects which, in rare  cases, include permanent [[neurological]] damage.{{cn|date=January 2013}} Vaccines that only contain attenuated vaccinia viruses (an attenuated virus is one in which the pathogenicity has been decreased through [[serial passage]]) have been proposed, but some researchers have questioned the possible effectiveness of such a vaccine. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), "vaccination within 3 days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms in the vast majority of people. Vaccination 4 to 7 days after exposure likely offers some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease." This, along with vaccinations of so-called first-responders, is the current plan of action being devised by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (including [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]) in the [[United States]].

In May 2007, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee of the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] voted unanimously that a new live virus vaccine produced by [[Acambis]], [[ACAM2000]], is both safe and effective for use in persons at high risk of exposure to smallpox virus. However, due to the high rate of serious adverse effects, the vaccine will only be made available to the CDC (a part of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]) for the [[Strategic National Stockpile]].<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Food and Drug Administration | title = Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee Meeting | date = 17 May 2007 | accessdate = 2 May 2013 | url = http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/07/briefing/2007-4292B2-00-index.htm }}</ref>

The main problem with developing a new, safer vaccine, is that, barring a bioterrorist attack on immunized individuals, its effectiveness cannot be tested on humans, and other animals do not naturally contract smallpox. [[Monkey]]s at [[USAMRIID]] research facilities have been infected, but tests on animals that are artificially infected with a human disease may give false or misleading results. To demonstrate safety and effectiveness, human trials always have to confirm data obtained from animal testing.

In the United States, the smallpox vaccine is the only FDA-approved treatment for smallpox and [[monkeypox]]. As with smallpox, vaccination after infection is effective if the vaccine is given before symptoms develop.

Currently, the United States Air Force has made it mandatory that any airman deploying to the Middle East must receive the smallpox vaccination before leaving stateside. The same is true of the US Army, and any US Marine being deployed outside the contiguous United States (OCONUS), as well as any US Marine or Navy sailor being deployed ship side.  It is also an option for all Department of Defense employees and contractors traveling to the United States Central Command's Area of Responsibility.

== HIV protection ==
Recent studies suggest the smallpox vaccine provides some level of defense against [[HIV]].  Both the smallpox vaccine and HIV exploit a receptor called [[CCR5]], which is expressed on the surface of white blood cells.  Researchers theorize that one factor in the sudden spread of HIV in the early 1980s was the result of eradication of smallpox in the late 1970s, and the subsequent and abrupt decline in smallpox vaccinations worldwide. The smallpox vaccine appeared to cut HIV replication five-fold.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8686750.stm| title=Smallpox demise linked to spread of HIV infection | date=17 May 2010 |accessdate=18 May 2010|publisher=The BBC}}</ref>

== Vaccine stockpiles ==
In late 2001, the governments of the United States and the [[United Kingdom]] considered stockpiling smallpox vaccines, even while assuring the public that there was no "specific or credible" threat of bioterrorism.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/10/22/wthrax22.xml| title=Talks on medicines to fight bio-terrorism |first=Sara| last=Womack| date=22 October 2001 |accessdate=23 November 2007|publisher=The Telegraph| location=London}}</ref>  Later, the director of [[State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR]] warned that terrorists could easily lure underpaid former Soviet researchers to turn over samples to be used as a weapon, saying "All you need is a sick fanatic to get to a populated place.
