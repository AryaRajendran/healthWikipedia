'''Bronchiolitis''' is inflammation of the [[bronchiole]]s, the smallest air passages of the lungs. It usually occurs in children less than two years of age with the majority being aged between three and six months.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Paediatric Society of New Zealand.|journal=The Society|year=2005|url=http://www.paediatrics.org.nz/documents/ 2005%20documents%20denise/guidelines/Wheezeendorsed.pdf}}</ref> It presents with coughing, wheezing and [[shortness of breath]] which can cause some children difficulty feeding. This inflammation is usually caused by [[respiratory syncytial virus]] (70% of cases)<ref name="Association of rhinovirus infection with increased disease severity in acute bronchiolitis">{{cite journal|last=Papadopoulos NG|coauthors=Moustaki M, Tsolia M, Bossios A, Astra E, Prezerakou A|journal=Am J Respir Crit Care Med|year=2002}}</ref>  and is much more common in the winter months. Treatment is typically supportive and may involve the use of [[nebulized]] [[epinephrine]] or [[hypertonic saline]]. Bronchiolitis is common with up to one third of children being affected in their first year of life.

== Signs and symptoms ==
In a typical case, an infant under two years of age develops [[cough]], [[wheeze]], and shortness of breath over one or two days. Crackles and/or wheeze are typical findings on listening to the chest with a stethoscope. The infant may be breathless for several days. After the acute illness, it is common for the airways to remain sensitive for several weeks, leading to recurrent cough and wheeze.

Some signs of severe disease include:<ref>{{cite book|title=BRONCHIOLITIS IN CHILDREN (Sign Guideline 91)|year=2006|publisher=Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network|isbn=9781905813018|url=http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/91/index.html}}</ref> 
* poor feeding (less than half of usual fluid intake in preceding 24 hours)
* lethargy
* history of [[apnea]]
* respiratory rate >70/min
* presence of nasal flaring and/or grunting
* severe chest wall recession
* [[cyanosis]]

== Causes ==
The term usually refers to acute viral bronchiolitis, a common disease in infancy. This is most commonly caused by [[respiratory syncytial virus]]<ref name="pmid16860701">{{cite journal |author=Smyth RL, Openshaw PJ |title=Bronchiolitis |journal=[[Lancet]] |volume=368 |issue=9532 |pages=312–22 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16860701 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69077-6 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(06)69077-6}}</ref> (RSV, also known as human pneumovirus). Other viruses which may cause this illness include [[metapneumovirus]], [[influenza]], [[parainfluenza]], [[coronavirus]], [[adenovirus]], and [[rhinovirus]].

Studies have shown there is a link between voluntary [[caesarean section|caesarean]] birth and an increased prevalence of bronchiolitis. A recent study by [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]'s [[Telethon Institute for Child Health Research]] has shown an 11% increase in hospital admissions for children delivered this way.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-31/elective-caesarean-heightens-respiratory-risk/3611358</ref> Children born prematurely (less than 35 weeks), with a low birth weight or who suffer from congenital heart disease may have higher rates of Bronchiolitis and are more likely to require hospital admission. There is evidence that breastfeeding provides some protection against bronchiolitis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carbonell-Estrany X, Figueras-Aloy J,|title=Identifying risk factors for severe respiratory syncytial virus among infants born after 33 through 35 completed weeks of gestation: different methodologies yield consistent findings.|journal=. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2004;23(11 Suppl):S193-201|year=2004}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis is typically made by clinical examination. [[Chest X-ray]] is sometimes useful to exclude [[pneumonia]], but not indicated in routine cases.<ref name=Peds10>{{cite journal|last=Zorc|first=JJ|coauthors=Hall, CB|title=Bronchiolitis: recent evidence on diagnosis and management|journal=Pediatrics|date=2010 Feb|volume=125|issue=2|pages=342–9|pmid=20100768|doi=10.1542/peds.2009-2092}}</ref> 

Testing for the specific viral cause can be done but has little effect on management and thus is not routinely recommended.<ref name=Peds10/> RSV testing by [[direct immunofluorescence]] testing on nasopharyngeal aspirate had a sensitivity of 61% and specificity of 89%.<ref name="pmid14757603">{{cite journal| author=Bordley WC, Viswanathan M, King VJ, Sutton SF, Jackman AM, Sterling L et al.| title=Diagnosis and testing in bronchiolitis: a systematic review | journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med | year= 2004 | volume= 158 | issue= 2 | pages= 119–26 | pmid=14757603 | doi=10.1001/archpedi.158.2.119 }}</ref> Identification of  those who are RSV-positive can help for: disease surveillance, grouping ("cohorting") people together in hospital wards to prevent cross infection, predicting whether the disease course has peaked yet, reducing the need for other diagnostic procedures (by providing confidence that a cause has been identified).

Infant with bronchiolitis between the age of two and three months have a second infection by bacteria (usually a [[urinary tract infection]]) less than 6% of the time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ralston|first=S|coauthors=Hill, V, Waters, A|title=Occult serious bacterial infection in infants younger than 60 to 90 days with bronchiolitis: a systematic review.|journal=Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine|date=2011 Oct|volume=165|issue=10|pages=951–6|pmid=21969396|doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2011.155}}</ref>

== Prevention ==
Prevention of bronchiolitis relies strongly on measures to reduce the spread of the viruses that cause respiratory infections (that is, handwashing, and  avoiding exposure to those symptomatic with respiratory infections).  In addition to good hygiene an improved immune system is a great tool for prevention.  One way to improve the immune system is to feed the infant with breast milk, especially during the first month of life.<ref name="pmid22103307">{{cite journal | author = Belderbos ME, Houben ML, van Bleek GM, ''et al.'' | title = Breastfeeding modulates neonatal innate immune responses: a prospective birth cohort study | journal = [[Pediatric Allergy and Immunology : Official Publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology]] | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–74 | year = 2012 | month = February | pmid = 22103307 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3038.2011.01230.x | url =  }}</ref>  [[passive immunization|Immunizations]] are available for premature infants who meet certain criteria (some [[cardiac]] and [[respiratory]] disorders) such as [[Palivizumab]] (a [[monoclonal antibody]] against RSV).  [[Passive immunization]] therapy requires monthly injections every winter.

== Management ==
Treatment and management of bronchiolitis is usually focused on the symptoms instead of the infection itself (supportive therapies) since the infection will run its course and complications are typically from the symptoms themselves.<ref name="Wright">{{cite journal | last=Wright | first=M | coauthors=Mullett CJ, Piedimonte G et al. | title=Pharmacological management of acute bronchiolitis |journal=Veterinary Research | volume=4 | issue=5 | pages=895–903 | month=October | year=2008 | pmid=19209271 | pmc=2621418 }}</ref>

=== Inhaled epinephrine ===
[[Nebulized]]  and inhaled [[epinephrine]] (both [[Racemic epinephrine|racemic]] and [[Epinephrine|levo(1)-epinephrine]]) has been shown to decrease hospitalization rates.<ref name="pmid21678340">{{cite journal| author=Hartling L, Bialy LM, Vandermeer B, Tjosvold L, Johnson DW, Plint AC et al.| title=Epinephrine for bronchiolitis | journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev | year= 2011 | volume= | issue= 6 | pages= CD003123 | pmid=21678340 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003123.pub3 | pmc= | url=| editor1-last=Hartling| editor1-first=Lisa }}</ref><ref name=BMJ11>{{cite journal|last=Hartling|first=L|coauthors=Fernandes, RM, Bialy, L, Milne, A, Johnson, D, Plint, A, Klassen, TP, Vandermeer, B|title=Steroids and bronchodilators for acute bronchiolitis in the first two years of life: systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=2011 Apr 6|volume=342|pages=d1714|pmid=21471175|doi=10.1136/bmj.d1714|pmc=3071611}}</ref>

=== Inhaled hypertonic saline ===
Inhaled [[hypertonic saline]] (3%) appears to be effective in improving clinical outcomes and shortening the duration of hospital stay.<ref name="Peds10" />

=== Other medications ===
Currently other medications do not yet have evidence to support their use.<ref name=BMJ11/>

=== Non-effective treatments ===
[[Ribavirin]] is an antiviral drug which does not appear to be effective for bronchiolitis.<ref name=Bourke11>{{cite journal|last=Bourke|first=T|coauthors=Shields, M|title=Bronchiolitis|journal=Clinical evidence|date=2011 Apr 11|volume=2011|pmid=21486501}}</ref> [[Antibiotic]]s are often given in case of a bacterial infection complicating bronchiolitis, but have no effect on the underlying viral infection.<ref name=Bourke11/> [[Corticosteroids]] have no proven benefit in bronchiolitis treatment and are not advised.<ref name=Bourke11/> [[DNAse]] has not been found to be effective.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=847 |title=BestBets: Do recombinant DNAse improve clinical outcome in an infant with RSV positive bronchiolitis? |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
90% of the patients are aged between 1 and 9 months old. Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospitalization up to the first year of life. It is epidemic in winters.
