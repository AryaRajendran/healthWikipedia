'''Thomas Burbacher''', PhD, is  professor of environmental and [[occupational health]] sciences and the director of the [[Infant Primate Research Laboratory]] at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]].<ref>http://depts.washington.edu/chdd/iddrc/res_aff/burbacher.html</ref>

==Education==

Burbacher earned his bachelor's degree in [[psychology]] from the [[University of Cincinnati]] in 1973, and his doctorate from the University of Washington in 1983, also in psychology.

==Research==

Burbachers research interests include [[behavioral toxicology]] and the [[Neural development|neurodevelopmental effects]] of pre- and postnatal exposure to environmental contaminants, including [[pesticide]]s and [[heavy metals]]. His studies using primate models have revealed significant long-term effects of prenatal exposure to [[methylmercury]], a common neurotoxin, and to [[methanol]], a potential motor fuel alternative. In-utero exposure to methylmercury has been linked to mental retardation, sensory disturbances such as blindness and deafness, and significant delays in motor development.

===Infant Primate Research Laboratory===

Over one hundred monkeys reside at the University of Washington's [[Infant Primate Research Laboratory]] (IPRL), where Burbacher and other researchers conduct some of the world's most expensive and exclusive medical research. "It's one of the only facilities in the country where we can observe animals as they mature from infancy," said Thomas Burbacher

Burbacher studied a group of [[macaque]] monkeys, from birth to sixteen years of age, to evaluate near- and long-term effects of in-utero methylmercury exposure on physical development, [[cognition]], and sensory function. The similarity of macaque monkey [[DNA]] to that of humans, 92% identical, makes them useful as models of the human body and brain. Burbacher's research on macaques has been used in the development of safety policies aimed at setting maximum human exposure levels for environmental contaminants associated with adverse health effects and developmental disabilities.
