'''Tachycardia''' is  a [[heart rate]] that exceeds the normal range.  A heart rate over 100 beats per minute is generally accepted as tachycardia. Tachycardia can be caused by various factors which often are benign. However, tachycardia can be dangerous depending on the speed and type of rhythm. ''Tachycardia'' comes from the Greek words ''tachys'' (''rapid'' or ''accelerated'') and ''cardia'' (''of the heart'').

==Definition==
The upper threshold of a normal human resting heart rate is based upon age. Tachycardia for different age groups is as listed below:<ref>Custer JW, Rau RE, eds. Johns Hopkins: The Harriet Lane Handbook. 18th ed. Philadelphia, PA: Mosby Elsevier Inc; 2008. Data also available through [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/804613-overview eMedicine: Pediatrics, Tachycardia].</ref>
*1–2 days: >159 beats per minute (bpm)
*3–6 days: >166 bpm
*1–3 weeks: >182 bpm
*1–2 months: >179 bpm
*3–5 months: >186 bpm
*6–11 months: >169 bpm
*1–2 years: >151 bpm
*3–4 years: >137 bpm
*5–7 years: >133 bpm
*8–11 years: >130 bpm
*12–15 years: >119 bpm
*>15 years – adult: >100 bpm
 
When the heart beats excessively rapidly, the heart pumps less efficiently and provides less blood flow to the rest of the body, including the heart itself.  The increased heart rate also leads to increased work and oxygen demand by the heart, which can lead to rate related [[ischemia]].<ref name=harrisons>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 17th Edition</ref>

==Differential diagnosis==
[[Image:Electrocardiogram of Ventricular Tachycardia.png|thumb|12 lead [[electrocardiogram]] showing a [[ventricular tachycardia]] (VT)]]
An [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) is used to classify the type of tachycardia. They may be classified into narrow and wide complex based on the [[QRS complex]].<ref name=ACLS2010/> Presented in the order of most to least common they are:<ref name=ACLS2010/>

Narrow complex
*[[Sinus tachycardia]], which originates from the [[Sino-atrial node|sino-atrial (SA) node]], near the base of the [[superior vena cava]].
*[[Atrial fibrillation]]
*[[Atrial flutter]]
*[[AV nodal reentrant tachycardia]]
*[[Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome|Accessory pathway mediated tachycardia]]
*[[Atrial tachycardia]]
*[[Multifocal atrial tachycardia]]
*[[Junctional tachycardia]]

Wide complex
*[[Ventricular tachycardia]], any tachycardia which originates in the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]].
*Any narrow complex tachycardia combined with a problem with the [[Bundle branch block|conduction system]] of the heart, often termed "supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy."
*A narrow complex tachycardia with an accessory conduction pathway, often termed "supraventricular tachycardia with pre-excitation" (e.g. [[Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome]]).
*Pacemaker-tracked or pacemaker-mediated tachycardia.

Tachycardias may be classified as either narrow complex tachycardias (supraventricular tachycardias) or wide complex tachycardias. Narrow and wide refer to the width of the [[QRS complex]] on the [[ECG]]. Narrow complex tachycardias tend to originate in the atria, while wide complex tachycardias tend to originate in the ventricles. Tachycardias can be further classified as either regular or irregular.

===Sinus===
{{Main|Sinus tachycardia}}
{{Anchor|Reflex tachycardia}}
The body has several [[feedback mechanism]]s to maintain adequate blood flow and [[blood pressure]].  If blood pressure decreases, the heart beats faster in an attempt to raise it. This is called [[reflex]] tachycardia. This can happen in response to a decrease in blood volume (through [[dehydration]] or [[bleeding]]), or an unexpected change in [[blood flow]]. The most common cause of the latter is [[orthostatic hypotension]] (also called [[postural hypotension]]).  [[Fever]], [[hyperventilation]], [[diarrhea]] and severe [[infections]] can also cause tachycardia, primarily due to increase in [[metabolic]] demands.

An increase in [[sympathetic nervous system]] stimulation causes the heart rate to increase, both by the direct action of [[sympathetic nerve]] fibers on the heart and by causing the [[endocrine]] system to release [[hormone]]s such as [[epinephrine|epinephrine (adrenaline)]], which have a similar effect.  Increased sympathetic stimulation is usually due to physical or psychological stress.  This is the basis for the so-called [[Fight-or-flight response|"Fight or Flight"]] response, but such stimulation can also be induced by [[stimulant]]s such as [[ephedrine]], [[amphetamines]] or [[cocaine]].  Certain [[endocrine disorders]] such as [[pheochromocytoma]] can also cause epinephrine release and can result in tachycardia independent nervous system stimulation. [[Hyperthyroidism]] can also cause tachycardia.<ref name=AmbMed2003>Barker RL, Burton JR, Zieve, PD eds. Principles of Ambulatory Medicine. Sixth Edition. Philadelphia, PA: Lippinocott, Wilkins & Williams 2003</ref> The upper limit of normal rate for sinus tachycardia is thought to be 220 bpm minus age.

===Ventricular===
{{Main|Ventricular tachycardia}}
Ventricular tachycardia (VT or V-tach) is a potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia that originates in the ventricles. It is usually a regular, wide complex tachycardia with a rate between 120 and 250 beats per minute. Ventricular tachycardia has the potential of degrading to the more serious [[ventricular fibrillation]]. Ventricular tachycardia is a common, and often lethal, complication of a [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack).

Exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia is a phenomenon related to [[cardiac arrest|sudden death]]s, especially in patients with severe heart disease ([[ischemia]], acquired [[valvular heart disease|valvular heart]] and [[congenital heart disease]]) accompanied with left [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] [[:wikt:dysfunction|dysfunction]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medinet.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/medic/nckh/nhthat/e_nhthat.htm |title=Ventricular tachycardia and ST segment elevation during Exercise |accessdate=2007-07-21 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071014054004/http://medinet.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/medic/nckh/nhthat/e_nhthat.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-14}}</ref>

Both of these rhythms normally last for only a few [[second]]s to [[minute]]s'' ([[paroxysmal tachycardia]])'', but if VT persists it is extremely dangerous, often leading to [[ventricular fibrillation]].

===Supraventricular===
{{Main|Supraventricular tachycardia}}
This is a type tachycardia that originates from above the ventricles, such as the atria.  It is sometimes known as paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (PAT).  Several types of supraventricular tachycardia are known to exist.

====Atrial fibrillation====
[[Atrial fibrillation]] is one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias. It is generally an irregular, narrow complex rhythm. However, it may show wide QRS complexes on the ECG if a [[bundle branch block]] is present. At high rates, the QRS complex may also become wide due to the [[Ashman phenomenon]]. It may be difficult to determine the rhythm's regularity when the rate exceeds 150 beats per minute. Depending on the patient's health and other variables such as medications taken for rate control, atrial fibrillation may cause heart rates that span from 50 to 250 beats per minute (or even higher if an [[Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome|accessory pathway]] is present). However, new onset atrial fibrillation tends to present with rates between 100 and 150 beats per minute.

====AV nodal reentrant tachycardia====
[[AV nodal reentrant tachycardia]] (AVNRT) is the most common reentrant tachycardia. It is a regular [[supraventricular tachycardia|narrow complex tachycardia]] that usually responds well to the [[Valsalva maneuver]] or the drug [[adenosine]]. However, unstable patients sometimes require synchronized [[cardioversion]]. Definitive care may include [[catheter ablation]].

====AV reentrant tachycardia====
AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) requires an [[Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome|accessory pathway]] for its maintenance. AVRT may involve orthodromic conduction (where the impulse travels down the AV node to the ventricles and back up to the atria through the accessory pathway) or antidromic conduction (which the impulse travels down the accessory pathway and back up to the atria through the AV node). Orthodromic conduction usually results in a narrow complex tachycardia, and antidromic conduction usually results in a wide complex tachycardia that often mimics [[ventricular tachycardia]]. Most [[antiarrhythmics]] are [[contraindicated]] in the emergency treatment of AVRT, because they may paradoxically increase conduction across the accessory pathway.

====Junctional tachycardia====
Junctional tachycardia is an automatic tachycardia originating in the AV junction. It tends to be a regular, narrow complex tachycardia and may be a sign of digitalis toxicity.

==Management==
The management of tachycardia depends on its type (wide complex versus narrow complex), whether or not the person is stable or unstable, and if the instability is due to the tachycardia.<ref name=ACLS2010>{{cite journal |author=Neumar RW, Otto CW, Link MS, ''et al.'' |title=Part 8: adult advanced cardiovascular life support: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care |journal=Circulation |volume=122 |issue=18 Suppl 3 |pages=S729–67 |year=2010 |month=November |pmid=20956224 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970988 |url=}}</ref> Unstable means that either important organ functions are affected or [[cardiac arrest]] is about to occur.<ref name=ACLS2010/>

===Stable===
In those who are stable, treatment is determined by the exact [[ECG]] findings: wide versus narrow complex, regular versus irregular heart rate, and whether the QRS is [[QRS complex#Monomorphic or polymorphic|monomorphic or polymorphic]].

===Unstable===
In those who are unstable with a narrow complex tachycardia, intravenous [[adenosine]] may be attempted.<ref name=ACLS2010/> In all others immediate [[cardioversion]] is recommended.<ref name=ACLS2010/>
