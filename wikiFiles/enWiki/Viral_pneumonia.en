'''Viral pneumonia''' is a [[pneumonia]] caused by a [[virus]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000084236|viral pneumonia}}</ref>
Viruses are one of the two major causes of pneumonia, the other being [[bacterial pneumonia|bacteria]]; less common causes are fungi and parasites. Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children, while in adults bacteria are a more common cause.<ref>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, U.S.A. [http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/pnu/pnu_causes.html ''What Causes Pneumonia?'']</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Symptom]]s of viral pneumonia include [[fever]], non-productive [[cough]], [[runny nose]], and systemic symptoms (e.g. [[myalgia]], [[headache]]). Different viruses cause different symptoms.

==Cause==
Common causes of viral pneumonia are:
* ''[[Influenza virus]]'' A and B<ref name=Kumar13-7/>
* ''[[Human respiratory syncytial virus|Respiratory syncytial virus]]'' (RSV)<ref name=Kumar13-7/>
* ''[[Human parainfluenza viruses]]'' (in children)<ref name=Kumar13-7>Table 13-7 in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology: With STUDENT CONSULT Online Access |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.</ref>

Rarer viruses that commonly result in pneumonia include:
* ''[[Adenovirus]]es'' (in military recruits)<ref name=Kumar13-7/>
* ''[[Metapneumovirus]]''<ref name=Lancet11/>
* ''[[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus]]'' (SARS coronavirus) <ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/factsheet.htm http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/factsheet.htm]</ref>

Viruses that primarily cause other diseases, but sometimes cause pneumonia include:
* ''[[Herpes simplex virus]]'' (HSV), mainly in newborns
* ''[[Varicella-zoster virus]]'' (VZV)
* ''[[Measles|Measles virus]]''
* ''[[Rubella virus]]''
* ''[[Cytomegalovirus]]'' (CMV), mainly in people with immune system problems

The most commonly identified agents in children are ''respiratory syncytial virus'', ''[[rhinovirus]]'', ''human metapneumovirus'', ''human [[bocavirus]]'', and ''parainfluenza viruses''.<ref name=Lancet11/>

==Pathophysiology==

Viruses must invade cells in order to reproduce. Typically, a virus will reach the lungs by traveling in droplets through the [[mouth]] and [[Human nose|nose]] with [[inhalation]]. There, the virus invades the cells lining the airways and the [[Alveolus|alveoli]]. This invasion often leads to cell death either through direct killing by the virus or by self-destruction through [[apoptosis]].

Further damage to the lungs occurs when the immune system responds to the infection. [[White blood cell]]s, in particular [[lymphocyte]]s, are responsible for activating a variety of chemicals ([[cytokine]]s) which cause leaking of fluid into the alveoli. The combination of cellular destruction and fluid-filled alveoli interrupts the transportation of oxygen into the bloodstream.

In addition to the effects on the lungs, many viruses affect other [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and can lead to illness affecting many different bodily functions. Viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infection; for this reason, bacterial pneumonia often complicates viral pneumonia.

==Prevention==

The best prevention against viral pneumonia is vaccination against [[influenza vaccines|influenza]], [[adenovirus vaccine|adenovirus]], [[varicella vaccine|chickenpox, herpes zoster]], [[measles vaccine|measles]], and [[rubella vaccine|rubella]].

==Treatment==
In cases of viral pneumonia where influenza A or B are thought to be causative agents, patients who are seen within 48 hours of symptom onset may benefit from treatment with [[oseltamivir]] or [[zanamivir]]. [[Human respiratory syncytial virus|Respiratory syncytial virus]] (RSV) may be treated with [[ribavirin]]. [[Herpes simplex virus]] and [[varicella-zoster virus]] infections are usually treated with [[aciclovir]], whilst [[ganciclovir]] is used to treat [[cytomegalovirus]]. There is no known efficacious treatment for pneumonia caused by [[SARS|SARS coronavirus]], [[adenovirus]], [[hantavirus]], [[parainfluenza]] or [[Swine flu|H1N1]] virus {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}; treatment is largely supportive.

==Epidemiology==
Viral pneumonia occurs in about 200&nbsp;million people a year which includes about 100&nbsp;million children and 100&nbsp;million adults.<ref name=Lancet11>{{cite journal|last=Ruuskanen|first=O|coauthors=Lahti, E, Jennings, LC, Murdoch, DR|title=Viral pneumonia.|journal=Lancet|date=2011-04-09|volume=377|issue=9773|pages=1264â€“75|pmid=21435708|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61459-6}}</ref>
