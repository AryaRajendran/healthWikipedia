==Signs and symptoms==
The most common presentation is a single large, deep ulcer (although several smaller ulcers may occur) in the internal surface of one or both [[labia minora]].<ref name=Heller>{{cite book |author=Heller DS, Wallach RC |title=Vulvar disease: a clinicopathological approach |publisher=Informa Healthcare |year=2007 |pages=51–2 |isbn=0-8493-3793-3 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-u8ki9L4HL0C&pg=PT65}}</ref> The [[labia majora]] may be affected, as may the [[vagina]] and [[urethra]]. The ulcer develops very quickly, and is usually preceded by sudden onset of fever and malaise.<ref name=Heller/>

==Treatment==
Treatment is symptomatic, and usually of little value; in most cases, the ulcer heals spontaneously within four to six weeks, leaving scars. Topical [[analgesic]]s and anesthetics, as well as topical application of disinfectants/[[astringent]]s such as [[potassium permanganate]] (in [[sitz bath]]s), is commonly used.<ref name=Heller/> In severe cases, a combination of systemic [[glucocorticoid]]s and [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]]s has been recommended.

==History==
The disease was first described in October 1912 by [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galician]]-born Austrian dermatologist and microbiologist [[Benjamin Lipschütz]], who published a series of four cases in girls aged 14 to 17.<ref name=Lipschutz/> He initially ascribed the ulcer to infection with "''Bacillus crassus''" (''[[Lactobacillus acidophilus]]'').<ref name=whonamedit/><ref name=Lipschutz/>
