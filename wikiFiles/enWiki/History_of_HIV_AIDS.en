[[AIDS]] is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]), which originated in non-human [[primate]]s in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and was transferred to humans during the late 19th or early 20th century.

Two types of HIV exist: [[HIV-1]] and [[HIV-2]]. HIV-1 is more virulent, is more easily transmitted and is the cause of the vast majority of HIV infections globally.<ref name=Reeves>{{cite journal |first1=Jacqueline D. |last1=Reeves |first2=Robert W. |last2=Doms |title=Human immunodeficiency virus type 2. |journal=The Journal of general virology |volume=83 |issue=Pt 6 |pages=1253–65 |year=2002 |pmid=12029140 |doi=10.1099/vir.0.18253-0}}</ref> The pandemic strain of HIV-1 is closely related to a virus found in the [[chimpanzee]]s of the subspecies ''Pan troglodytes troglodytes'', which lives in the forests of the Central African nations of [[Cameroon]], Equatorial Guinea, [[Gabon]], [[Republic of Congo]] (or Congo-Brazzaville), and [[Central African Republic]].

== Transmission from non-humans to humans ==
Most HIV researchers agree that HIV evolved at some point from the closely related [[Simian immunodeficiency virus]] (SIV), and that SIV or HIV (post mutation) was transferred from non-human primates to humans in the recent past (as a type of [[zoonosis]]). Research in this area is conducted using [[molecular phylogenetics]], comparing viral genomic sequences to determine relatedness.

=== HIV-1 from chimpanzees and gorillas to humans ===

Scientists generally accept that the known strains (or groups) of [[HIV-1]] are most closely related to the simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) endemic in wild [[ape]] populations of West Central African forests. Particularly, each of the known HIV-1 strains is either closely related to the [[Simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] that infects the [[chimpanzee]] subspecies ''Pan troglodytes troglodytes'' (SIVcpz), or to the SIV that infects [[Western lowland gorilla]]s (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla''), called SIVgor.<ref name=Keele>{{cite journal |last1=Keele |first1=B.

Using [[HIV-1]] sequences preserved in human biological samples along with estimates of viral mutation rates, scientists calculate that the jump from chimpanzee to human probably happened during the late 19th or early 20th century, a time of rapid urbanisation and colonisation in equatorial Africa. Exactly when the [[zoonosis]] occurred is not known. Some molecular dating studies suggest that HIV-1 group M had its [[most recent common ancestor]] (MRCA) (that is, started to spread in the human population) in the early 20th century, probably between 1915 and 1941.<ref name=Salemi>{{cite journal |last1=Salemi |first1=M. |title=Dating the common ancestor of SIVcpz and HIV-1 group M and the origin of HIV-1 subtypes by using a new method to uncover clock-like molecular evolution |journal=The FASEB Journal |pages=276–78 |year=2000 |doi=10.1096/fj.00-0449fje |pmid=11156935 |volume=15 |issue=2}}</ref><ref name=Korber>{{cite journal |last1=Korber |first1=B. |last2=Muldoon |first2=M |last3=Theiler |first3=J |last4=Gao |first4=F |last5=Gupta |first5=R |last6=Lapedes |first6=A |last7=Hahn |first7=BH |last8=Wolinsky |first8=S |last9=Bhattacharya |first9=T |title=Timing the Ancestor of the HIV-1 Pandemic Strains |journal=Science |volume=288 |issue=5472 |pages=1789–96 |year=2000 |pmid=10846155 |doi=10.1126/science.288.5472.1789|bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1789K }}</ref><ref name=Lemey2004/> A study published in 2008, analyzing viral sequences recovered from a recently discovered biopsy made in [[Kinshasa]], in 1960, along with previously known sequences, suggested a common ancestor between 1873 and 1933 (with central estimates varying between 1902 and 1921).<ref name=Worobey2008>{{cite journal |last1=Worobey |first1=Michael |last2=Gemmel |first2=Marlea |last3=Teuwen |first3=Dirk E. |last4=Haselkorn |first4=Tamara |last5=Kunstman |first5=Kevin |last6=Bunce |first6=Michael |last7=Muyembe |first7=Jean-Jacques |last8=Kabongo |first8=Jean-Marie M. |last9=Kalengayi |first9=Raphaël M. |title=Direct evidence of extensive diversity of HIV-1 in Kinshasa by 1960 |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7213 |pages=661–4 |year=2008 |pmid=18833279 |doi=10.1038/nature07390|bibcode = 2008Natur.455..661W }}</ref><ref name="Breitbart">[http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=081001175219.6q8ulcz0&show_article=1 "AIDS virus leapt the species barrier early last century: study"] Breitbart, October 1, 2008.

=== HIV-2 from sooty mangabeys to humans ===

Similar research has been undertaken with [[Simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] strains collected from several wild [[sooty mangabey]] (''Cercocebus atys atys'') (SIVsmm) communities of the West African nations of [[Sierra Leone]], Liberia, and [[Ivory Coast]]. The resulting phylogenetic analyses show that the viruses most closely related to the two strains of [[HIV-2]] which spread considerably in humans (HIV-2 groups A and B) are the SIVsmm found in the sooty mangabeys of the Tai forest, in western [[Ivory Coast]].<ref name=Santiago2005/>

There are six additional known [[HIV-2]] groups, each having been found in just one person. They all seem to derive from independent transmissions from [[sooty mangabey]]s to humans. Groups C and D have been found in two people from [[Liberia]], groups E and F have been discovered in two people from [[Sierra Leone]], and groups G and H have been detected in two people from the [[Ivory Coast]]. These [[HIV-2]] strains are probably [[dead-end infection|dead-end infections]], and each of them is most closely related to SIVsmm strains from [[sooty mangabeys]] living in the same country where the human infection was found.<ref name=Santiago2005/><ref name=Hooper2000/><ref name=Marx2001>{{cite journal |authors=Marx PA, Alcabes PG, Drucker E |title=Serial human passage of simian immunodeficiency virus by unsterile injections and the emergence of epidemic human immunodeficiency virus in Africa |volume=356 |pages=911–20 |year=2001 |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |pmc=1088484 | pmid=11405938 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2001.0867 |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/356/1410/911.abstract |issue=1410}}</ref>

=== Bushmeat practice ===

According to the [[natural transfer]] theory (also called 'Hunter Theory' or 'Bushmeat Theory'), the "simplest and most plausible explanation for the cross-species transmission"<ref name=Sharp2001/> of SIV or HIV (post mutation), the virus was transmitted from an [[ape]] or [[monkey]] to a human when a hunter or [[bushmeat]] vendor/handler was bitten or cut while hunting or butchering the animal. The resulting exposure to blood or other bodily fluids of the animal can result in SIV infection.<ref name="avert">{{cite web|author=Annabel Kanabus & Sarah Allen.

== Emergence ==

=== Conditions for successful zoonosis ===

[[Zoonosis]] (transfer of a [[pathogen]] from non-human animals to humans) and subsequent spread of the pathogen between humans, requires the following conditions:
#a human population;
#a nearby population of a host animal;
#an infectious pathogen in the host animal that can spread from animal to human;
#interaction between the species to transmit enough of the pathogen to humans to establish a human foothold, which could have taken millions of individual exposures;
#ability of the pathogen to spread from human to human (perhaps acquired by [[mutation]]);
#some process allowing the pathogen to disperse widely, preventing the infection from "burning out" by either killing off its human hosts or provoking immunity in a local population of humans.

=== The unresolved issues about HIV origins and emergence ===

It is clear that the several HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains descend from SIVcpz, SIVgor, and SIVsmm viruses,<ref name=Santiago2005/><ref name=VanHeuv/><ref name=Plantier/><ref name=Sharp2001/><ref name=Gao/><ref name=Marx2001/> and that bushmeat practice provides the most plausible venue for cross-species transfer to humans.<ref name=Sharp2001/><ref name=Gao/><ref name=Kalish2005/> However, some loose ends remain unresolved.

It is not yet explained why only four HIV groups ([[HIV-1]] groups M and O, and [[HIV-2]] groups A and B) spread considerably in human populations, despite [[bushmeat]] practices being very widespread in Central and West Africa,<ref name=Sousa2010/> and the resulting human [[Simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] infections being common.<ref name=Kalish2005/>

It remains also unexplained why all epidemic HIV groups emerged in humans nearly simultaneously, and only in the 20th century, despite very old human exposure to SIV (a recent phylogenetic study demonstrated that SIV is at least tens of thousands of years old).<ref name=Worobey2010>{{cite journal |last1=Worobey |first1=M. |last2=Telfer |first2=P. |last3=Souquiere |first3=S. |last4=Hunter |first4=M. |last5=Coleman |first5=C. A. |last6=Metzger |first6=M.

The discovery of the main HIV / SIV phylogenetic relationships permits explaining ''broadly'' HIV [[biogeography]]: the early centers of the [[HIV-1]] groups were in Central Africa, where the  primate reservoirs of the related SIVcpz and SIVgor viruses ([[chimpanzee]]s and [[gorilla]]s) exist; similarly, the [[HIV-2]] groups had their centers in West Africa, where [[sooty mangabey]]s, which harbor the related SIVsmm virus, exist. However these relationships do not explain more detailed patterns of biogeography, such as why epidemic HIV-2 groups (A and B) only evolved in the [[Ivory Coast]], which is only one of six countries harboring the [[sooty mangabey]]. It is also unclear why the SIVcpz endemic in the [[chimpanzee]] subspecies ''Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii'' (inhabiting the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], Central African Republic, [[Rwanda]], Burundi, [[Uganda]], and [[Tanzania]]) did not spawn an epidemic HIV-1 strain to humans, while the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] was the main center of HIV-1 group M, a virus descended from SIVcpz strains of a subspecies (''Pan troglodytes troglodytes'') that does not exist in this country.

=== Theories of HIV origin and epidemic emergence ===

Several of the theories of HIV origin put forward (described below) attempt to explain the unresolved loose ends described in the previous section. Most of them accept the (above described) established knowledge of the HIV/SIV phylogenetic relationships, and also accept that [[bushmeat]] practice was the most likely cause of the initial transfer to humans. All of them propose that the simultaneous epidemic emergences of four HIV groups in the late 19th-early 20th century, and the lack of previous emergences, are explained by new factor(s) that appeared in the relevant African regions in that timeframe. These new factor(s) would have acted either to increase human exposures to SIV, to help it to adapt to the human organism by [[mutation]] (thus enhancing its between-humans transmissibility), or to cause an initial burst of transmissions crossing an [[epidemiological threshold]], and therefore increasing the odds of continued spread.

==== Social changes and urbanization ====

It was proposed by Beatrice Hahn, Paul Sharp, and colleagues that "[the epidemic emergence of HIV] most likely reflects changes in population structure and behaviour in Africa during the 20th century and perhaps medical interventions that provided the opportunity for rapid human-to-human spread of the virus".<ref name=Sharp2001/> After the [[Scramble for Africa]]  started in the 1880s, European colonial powers established cities, towns, and other colonial stations. A largely masculine labor force was hastily recruited to work in fluvial and sea ports, railways, other infrastructures, and in plantations. This disrupted traditional tribal values, and favored [[sexual promiscuity]]. In the nascent cities women felt relatively liberated from rural tribal rules<ref name=Egerton1938>Egerton FC (1938) African Majesty: A Record of Refuge at the Court of the King of Bangangté in the French Cameroons. London: George Routledge & Sons.</ref> and many remained unmarried or divorced during long periods,<ref name=Sousa2010/><ref name=Gondola1997>{{cite book |first=Charles Didier |last=Gondola |title=Villes miroirs: migrations et identités urbaines à Kinshasa et Brazzaville, 1930–1970 |language=French |publisher=L'Harmattan |location=Paris |year=1996 |isbn=978-2-7384-4868-2}}{{page needed|date=December 2010}}</ref> this being very rare in African traditional societies.<ref name=Friedrichs1924>Friedrichs A (Herzogs zu Mecklenbourg), editor (1924) Wissenschaftliche Ergebnisse der Deutschen Zentral-Afrika Expedition 1907–1908.

Michael Worobey and colleagues observed that the growth of cities had probably a role in the epidemic emergence of HIV, since the phylogenetic datations of the two older strains of [[HIV-1]] (groups M and O), suggest that these viruses started to spread soon after the main Central African colonial cities were founded.<ref name=Worobey2008/>

==== Heart of Darkness ====

Amit Chitnis, Diana Rawls, and Jim Moore proposed that HIV may have emerged epidemically as a result of the harsh conditions, forced labor, displacement, and unsafe injection and [[vaccination]] practices associated with [[colonialism]], particularly in [[French Equatorial Africa]].<ref name=Chitnis2000>{{cite journal |last1=Chitnis |first1=Amit |last2=Rawls |first2=Diana |last3=Moore |first3=Jim |title=Origin of HIV Type 1 in Colonial French Equatorial Africa? |journal=AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=5–8 |year=2000 |pmid=10628811 |doi=10.1089/088922200309548}}</ref> The workers in plantations, construction projects, and other colonial enterprises were supplied with [[bushmeat]], this contributing to increase this activity, and then exposures to SIV. Several historical sources support the view that [[bushmeat]] hunting indeed increased, both because of the necessity to supply workers and  because firearms became more widely available.<ref name=Chitnis2000/><ref name=Merfield>Merfield FG (1957) Gorillas were my Neighbours.

The colonial authorities also gave many [[vaccination]]s against [[smallpox]], and injections, of which many would be made without sterilising the equipment between uses (unsafe or unsterile injections). Chitnis ''et al.'' proposed that both these [[parenteral]] risks and the prostitution associated with forced labor camps could have caused serial transmission (or [[serial passage]]) of SIV between humans (see discussion of this in the next section).<ref name=Chitnis2000/> In addition, they proposed that the conditions of extreme stress associated with forced labor could depress the [[immune system]] of workers, therefore prolonging the primary [[acute HIV infection|acute infection]] period of someone newly infected by SIV, thus increasing the odds of both adaptation of the virus to humans, and of further transmissions.<ref name=Moore2001>Moore J (2001) About this paper and comments on 'The River' url=http://weber.ucsd.edu/~jmoore/publications/HIVorigin.html</ref>

The authors predicted that HIV-1 originated in the area of [[French Equatorial Africa]], and in the early 20th century (when the colonial abuses and forced labor were at their peak). Later researches proved these predictions mostly correct: HIV-1 groups M and O started to spread in humans in late 19th–early 20th century.<ref name=Salemi/><ref name=Korber/><ref name=Lemey2004>{{cite journal |last1=Lemey |first1=P. |last2=Pybus |first2=OG |last3=Rambaut |first3=A |last4=Drummond |first4=AJ |last5=Robertson |first5=DL |last6=Roques |first6=P |last7=Worobey |first7=M |last8=Vandamme |first8=AM |title=The Molecular Population Genetics of HIV-1 Group O |journal=Genetics |volume=167 |issue=3 |pages=1059–68 |year=2004 |pmid=15280223 |pmc=1470933 |doi=10.1534/genetics.104.026666}}</ref><ref name=Worobey2008/> And all groups of HIV-1 descend from either SIVcpz or SIVgor from [[ape]]s living to the west of the [[Ubangi River]], either in countries which belonged to the [[French Equatorial Africa]] federation of colonies, in [[Equatorial Guinea]] (then a Spanish colony), or in [[Cameroon]] (which was a German colony between 1884 and 1916, then fell to Allied forces in World War I, and had most of its area administered by France, in close association with [[French Equatorial Africa]]).

This theory was later dubbed 'Heart of Darkness' by Jim Moore,<ref name=Moore2004>{{cite journal |author=Moore J |title=The Puzzling Origins of AIDS |journal=American Scientist |volume=92 |pages=540–47 |year=2004 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/my_amsci/restricted.aspx?act=pdf&id=3539589813439}}</ref> alluding to [[Heart of Darkness|the book of the same title]] written by [[Joseph Conrad]], the main focus of which is colonial abuses in equatorial Africa.

==== Unsterile injections ====

In several articles published since 2001, Preston Marx, Philip Alcabes, and Ernest Drucker proposed that HIV emerged because of rapid serial human-to-human transmission of [[Simian Immunodeficiency Virus|SIV]] (after a [[bushmeat]] hunter or handler became SIV-infected) through unsafe or unsterile injections.<ref name=Breitbart/><ref name=Marx2001/><ref name=Drucker2001>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)06967-7 |author=Drucker E, Alcabes PG, Marx PA |title=The injection century: massive unsterile injections and the emergence of human pathogens |journal=Lancet |volume=358 |issue=9297 |pages=1989–92 |year=2001 |pmid=11747942}}</ref><ref name=syringe>{{cite news |author=[[Donald G.

Central to Marx ''et al.'' argument is the concept of adaptation by [[serial passage]] (or serial transmission): an adventitious virus (or other [[pathogen]]) can increase its biological [[adaptation]] to a new host species if it is rapidly transmitted between hosts, while each host is still in the [[acute HIV infection|acute infection]] period. This process favors the accumulation of [[adaptive mutation]]s more rapidly, therefore increasing the odds that a better adapted viral variant will appear in the host before the [[immune system]] suppresses the virus.<ref name=Marx2001/> Such better adapted variant could then survive in the human host for longer than the short [[acute HIV infection|acute infection]] period, in high numbers (high [[viral load]]), which would grant it more possibilities of epidemic spread.

Marx ''et al.'' reported experiments of cross-species transfer of SIV in captive monkeys (some of which made by themselves), in which the use of [[serial passage]] helped to adapt SIV to the new monkey species after passage by three or four animals.<ref name=Marx2001/>

In agreement with this model is also the fact that, while both [[HIV-1]] and [[HIV-2]] attain substantial [[viral load]]s in the human organism, adventitious [[simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] infecting humans seldom does so: people with SIV antibodies often have very low or even undetectable SIV [[viral load]].<ref name=Kalish2005/> This suggests that both [[HIV-1]] and [[HIV-2]] are adapted to humans, and [[serial passage]] could have been the process responsible for it.

Marx ''et al.'' proposed that unsterile injections (that is, injections where the needle or syringe is reused without sterilization or cleaning between uses), which were likely very prevalent in Africa, during both the colonial period and afterwards, provided the mechanism of [[serial passage]] that permitted HIV to adapt to humans, therefore explaining why it emerged epidemically only in the 20th century.<ref name=Marx2001/><ref name=Drucker2001/>

===== Massive injections of the antibiotic era =====

Marx ''et al.'' emphasize the massive number of injections administered in Africa after [[antibiotic]]s were introduced (around 1950) as being the most likely implicated in the origin of HIV because, by these times (roughly in the period 1950 to 1970), injection intensity in Africa was maximal. They argued that a [[serial passage]] chain of 3 or 4 transmissions between humans is an unlikely event (the probability of transmission after a needle reuse is something between 0.3% and 2%, and only a few people have an acute SIV infection at any time), and so HIV emergence may have required the very high frequency of injections of the [[antibiotic]] era.<ref name=Marx2001/>

The molecular dating studies place the initial spread of the epidemic HIV groups before that time (see above).<ref name=Salemi/><ref name=Korber/><ref name=Lemey2004/><ref name=Worobey2008/><ref name=Lemey2003/><ref name=Wertheim/> According to Marx ''et al.'', these studies could have overestimated the age of the HIV groups, because they depend on a [[molecular clock]] assumption, may not have accounted for the effects of [[natural selection]] in the viruses, and the [[serial passage]] process alone would be associated with strong [[natural selection]].<ref name=Marx2001/>

===== The injection campaigns against sleeping sickness =====

David Gisselquist proposed that the mass injection campaigns to treat [[trypanosomiasis]] ([[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]]) in Central Africa were responsible for the emergence of HIV-1.<ref name=Gisselquist2003>{{cite journal |author=Gisselquist D |title=Emergence of the HIV type 1 epidemic in the twentieth century: comparing hypotheses to evidence |journal=AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses |volume=19 |issue=12 |pages=1071–78 |year=2003 |pmid=14709242 |doi=10.1089/088922203771881158 |url=http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089%2F088922203771881158}}</ref> Unlike Marx ''et al.'',<ref name=Marx2001/> Gisselquist argued that the millions of unsafe injections administered during these campaigns were sufficient to spread rare HIV infections into an epidemic, and that evolution of HIV through [[serial passage]] was not essential to the emergence of the HIV epidemic in the 20th century.<ref name=Gisselquist2003/>

This theory focuses on injection campaigns that peaked in the period 1910–40, that is, around the time the [[HIV-1]] groups started to spread.<ref name=Salemi/><ref name=Korber/><ref name=Lemey2004/><ref name=Worobey2008/> It also focuses on the fact that many of the injections in these campaigns were intravenous (which are more likely to transmit SIV/HIV than subcutaneous or intramuscular injections), and many of the patients received many (often more than 10) injections per year, therefore increasing the odds of SIV [[serial passage]].<ref name=Gisselquist2003/>

===== Other early injection campaigns =====

Jacques Pépin and Annie-Claude Labbé reviewed the colonial health reports of [[Cameroon]] and [[French Equatorial Africa]] for the period 1921–59, calculating the incidences of the diseases requiring intravenous injections. They concluded that [[trypanosomiasis]], [[leprosy]], [[yaws]], and [[syphilis]] were responsible for most intravenous injections. [[Schistosomiasis]], [[tuberculosis]], and vaccinations against [[smallpox]] represented lower [[parenteral]] risks: schistosomiasis cases were relatively few; tuberculosis patients only became numerous after mid century; and there were few smallpox vaccinations in the lifetime of each person.<ref name=Pepin2008>{{cite journal |author=Pépin J, Labbé AC |title=Noble goals, unforeseen consequences: control of tropical diseases in colonial Central Africa and the iatrogenic transmission of blood-borne viruses |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=744–53 |year=2008 |journal=Trop Med Int Health |pmid=18397182 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02060.x}}</ref>

The authors suggested that the very high prevalence of the [[Hepatitis C]] virus in southern [[Cameroon]] and forested areas of [[French Equatorial Africa]](around 40–50%) can be better explained by the unsterile injections used to treat [[yaws]], because this disease was much more prevalent than [[syphilis]], [[trypanosomiasis]], and [[leprosy]] in these areas. They suggested that all these parenteral risks caused, not only the massive spread of [[Hepatitis C]], but also the spread of other [[pathogen]]s, and the emergence of [[HIV-1]]: "the same procedures could have exponentially amplified HIV-1, from a single hunter/cook occupationally infected with SIVcpz to several thousand patients treated with arsenicals or other drugs, a threshold beyond which sexual transmission could prosper."<ref name=Pepin2008/> They do not suggest specifically [[serial passage]] as the mechanism of adaptation.

According to Pépin's 2011 book, ''The Origins of AIDS'',<ref name=AIDS>{{cite book|last= Pépin|first=Jacques|title=The Origins of AIDS|year=2011|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]| isbn=978-0-521-18637-7}}</ref> the virus can be traced to a central African bush hunter in 1921, with colonial medical campaigns using improperly sterilized syringe and needles playing a key role in enabling a future epidemic.  Pépin concludes that AIDS spread silently in Africa for decades, fueled by urbanization and prostitution since the initial cross-species infection. Pépin also claims that the virus was brought to the Americas by a Haitian teacher returning home from Zaire in the 1960s.<ref name=isbn9780521186377>{{cite book|author=Jacques Pépin|title=The Origins of AIDS|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2011|pages=311|isbn=978-0-521-18637-7|oclc=|quote=}}</ref> 
Sex tourism and contaminated blood transfusion centers ultimately propelled AIDS to public’s consciousness in the 80s and a worldwide pandemic.<ref name=AIDS/>

==== Genital ulcer diseases and sexual promiscuity ====

João Dinis de Sousa, Viktor Müller, Philippe Lemey, and Anne-Mieke Vandamme proposed that HIV became epidemic through sexual serial transmission, in nascent colonial cities, helped by a high frequency of [[genital ulcer]]s, caused by [[genital ulcer disease]]s (GUD).<ref name=Sousa2010/> GUD are simply [[sexually transmitted disease]]s that cause genital ulcers; examples are [[syphilis]], [[chancroid]], [[lymphogranuloma venereum]], and [[genital herpes]]. These diseases increase the probability of HIV transmission dramatically, from around 0.01–0.1% to 4–43% per heterosexual act, because the genital ulcers provide a portal of viral entry, and contain many activated [[T cell]]s expressing the [[CCR5]] co-receptor, the main cell targets of HIV.<ref name=Sousa2010/><ref name=Cameron>{{cite journal |author=Cameron DW, Simonsen JN, D'Costa LJ, Ronald AR, Maitha GM, ''et al.'' |title=Female to male transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1: risk factors for seroconversion in men |journal=Lancet |volume=334 |issue=8660 |pages=403–407 |year=1989 |pmid=2569597 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(89)90589-8 |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(89)90589-8/abstract}}</ref>

===== The probable time interval of cross-species transfer =====

Sousa ''et al.'' use molecular dating techniques to estimate the time when each HIV group split from its closest [[simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] lineage. Each HIV group necessarily crossed to humans between this time and the time when it started to spread (the time of the [[most recent common ancestor|MRCA]]), because after the MRCA certainly all lineages were already in humans, and before the split with the closest [[simian]] strain, the lineage was in a simian. HIV-1 groups M and O, split from their closest SIVs around 1876 (1847–1907), 1741 (1606–1870), respectively. HIV-2 did so around 1889 (1856–1922). This information, together with the datations of the HIV groups' [[Most recent common ancestor|MRCAs]] (described above) mean that all HIV groups likely crossed to humans in late 19th—early 20th century.<ref name=Sousa2010/>

===== Strong GUD incidence in nascent colonial cities =====

The authors reviewed colonial medical articles and archived medical reports of the countries at or near the ranges of [[chimpanzee]]s, [[gorilla]]s and [[sooty mangabey]]s, and found that [[genital ulcer disease]]s peaked in the colonial cities during their early growth period (up to 1935). The colonial authorities recruited men to work in railways, fluvial and sea ports, and other infrastructure projects, and most of these men did not bring their wives with them. Then, the highly male-biased [[sex ratio]] favoured prostitution, which in its turn caused an explosion of [[genital ulcer disease|GUD]] (especially [[syphilis]] and [[chancroid]]). After the mid-1930s, people's movements were more tightly controlled, and mass surveys and treatments (of [[arsenical]]s and other drugs) were organized, and so the GUD incidences started to decline. They declined even further after World War II, because of the heavy use of [[antibiotic]]s, so that, by the late 1950s, [[Kinshasa]] (which is the probable center of HIV-1 group M) had a very low GUD incidence. Similar processes happened in the cities of [[Cameroon]] and [[Ivory Coast]], where HIV-1 group O and HIV-2 respectively evolved.<ref name=Sousa2010/>

Therefore, the peak GUD incidences in cities<ref name=Sousa2010/> have a good temporal coincidence with the period when all main HIV groups crossed to humans and started to spread.<ref name=Sousa2010/><ref name=Salemi/><ref name=Korber/><ref name=Lemey2004/><ref name=Worobey2008/><ref name=Lemey2003/><ref name=Wertheim/> In addition, the authors gathered evidence that [[syphilis]] and the other GUDs were, like injections, absent from the densely forested areas of Central and West Africa before organized [[colonialism]] socially disrupted these areas (starting in the 1880s).<ref name=Sousa2010/> Thus, this theory also potentially explains why HIV emerged only after late 19th century.

===== Female circumcision =====

Uli Linke has argued that the practice of [[female circumcision]] is responsible for the high incidence of AIDS in Africa, since intercourse with a circumcised female is conducive to exchange of blood.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Linke | first=Uli | title = AIDS in Africa | journal = Science | volume = 231 | pages = 203 | date = January 1986 | doi=10.1126/science.231.4735.203-b | issue=4735|bibcode = 1986Sci...231..203L }}</ref>

=====Male circumcision distribution and HIV origins=====

Male [[circumcision]] may reduce the probability of HIV acquisition by men (see article [[Circumcision and HIV]]). Leaving aside blood [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]]s, the highest [[HIV-1]] transmissibility ever measured was from GUD-suffering female prostitutes to uncircumcised men—the measured risk was 43% in a single sexual act.<ref name=Cameron/> Sousa ''et al.'' reasoned that the adaptation and epidemic emergence of each HIV group may have required such extreme conditions, and thus reviewed the existing [[ethnography|ethnographic]] literature for patterns of male [[circumcision]] and hunting of [[ape]]s and [[monkey]]s for [[bushmeat]], focusing on the period 1880–1960, and on most of the 318 [[ethnic group]]s living in Central and West Africa.<ref name=Sousa2010/> They also collected censuses and other literature showing the ethnic composition of colonial cities in this period. Then, they estimated the circumcision frequencies of the Central African cities over time.

[[Circumcision]] is nowadays almost universal in almost all countries of Central and West Africa. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
However, Sousa ''et al.'' charts reveal that male circumcision frequencies were much lower in several cities of these areas in early 20th century. The reason is that many [[ethnic group]]s not performing circumcision by that time gradually adopted it, to imitate other ethnic groups and enhance the social acceptance of their boys ([[colonialism]] produced massive intermixing between African ethnic groups).<ref name=Sousa2010/><ref name=Friedrichs1924/> About 15–30% of men in [[Kinshasa]] and [[Douala]] in early 20th century should be uncircumcised, and these cities were the probable centers of HIV-1 groups M and O, respectively.<ref name=Sousa2010/>

The authors studied early [[circumcision]] frequencies in 12 cities of Central and West Africa, to test if this variable correlated with HIV emergence. This [[correlation]] was strong for [[HIV-2]]: among 6 West African cities that could have received immigrants infected with SIVsmm, the two cities from the [[Ivory Coast]] studied ([[Abidjan]] and [[Bouaké]]) had much higher frequency of uncircumcised men (60–85%) than the others, and epidemic [[HIV-2]] groups emerged initially in this country only. This correlation was less clear for [[HIV-1]] in Central Africa.<ref name=Sousa2010/>

===== Computer simulations of HIV emergence =====

Sousa ''et al.'' then built [[computer simulation]]s to test if an 'ill-adapted SIV' (meaning a [[simian immunodeficiency virus]] already infecting a human but incapable of transmission beyond the short [[acute HIV infection|acute infection]] period) could spread in colonial cities. The simulations used [[parameter]]s of sexual transmission obtained from the current HIV literature. They modelled people's 'sexual links', with different levels of sexual partner change among different categories of people (prostitutes, single women with several partners a year, married women, and men), according to data obtained from modern studies of [[sexual promiscuity]] in African cities. The simulations let the parameters (city size, proportion of people married, [[genital ulcer disease|GUD]] frequency, male [[circumcision]] frequency, and transmission parameters) vary, and explored several scenarios. Each scenario was run 1,000 times, to test the probability of SIV generating long chains of sexual transmission. The authors postulated that such long chains of sexual transmission were necessary for the SIV strain to adapt better to humans, becoming a HIV capable of further epidemic emergence.

The main result was that [[genital ulcer]] frequency was by far the most decisive factor. For the GUD levels prevailing in [[Kinshasa]], in early 20th century, long chains of SIV transmission had a high probability. For the lower [[genital ulcer disease|GUD]] levels existing in the same city in the late 1950s (see above), they were much less likely. And without GUD (a situation typical of villages in forested equatorial Africa before [[colonialism]]) SIV could not spread at all. City size was not an important factor. The authors propose that these findings explain the temporal patterns of HIV emergence: no HIV emerging in tens of thousands of years of human slaughtering of [[ape]]s and [[monkey]]s, several HIV groups emerging in the nascent, GUD-riddled, colonial cities, and no epidemically successful HIV group emerging in mid-20th century, when GUD was more controlled, and cities were much bigger.

Male [[circumcision]] had little to moderate effect in their simulations, but given the geographical [[correlation]] found, the authors propose that it could have had an indirect role, either by increasing [[genital ulcer disease]] itself (it is known that [[syphilis]], [[chancroid]], and several other GUDs have higher incidences in uncircumcised men), or by permitting further spread of the HIV strain, after the first chains of sexual transmission permitted [[adaptation]] to the human organism.

One of the main advantages of this theory is stressed by the authors: "It [the theory] also offers a conceptual simplicity because it proposes as causal factors for SIV adaptation to humans and initial spread the very same factors that most promote the continued spread of HIV nowadays: promiscuous sex, particularly involving sex workers, GUD, and possibly lack of circumcision."<ref name=Sousa2010/>

==== Iatrogenic and other theories ====

[[Iatrogenic]] theories propose that medical interventions were responsible for HIV origins. By proposing factors that only appeared in Central and West Africa after the late 19th century, they seek to explain why all HIV groups also started after that.

The theories centered on the role of [[parenteral]] risks, such as unsterile injections, [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]]s,<ref name=Marx2001/><ref name=Chitnis2000/><ref name=Gisselquist2003/><ref name=Pepin2008/> or [[smallpox]] vaccinations<ref name=Chitnis2000/> are accepted as plausible by most scientists of the field, and were already reviewed above.

== Pathogenicity of SIV in non-human primates ==

In most non-human primate species, natural [[simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] infection does not cause a fatal disease (but see below). Comparison of the gene sequence of SIV with HIV should therefore give us information about the factors necessary to cause disease in humans. The factors that determine the virulence of HIV as compared to most SIVs are only now being elucidated. Non-human SIVs contain a ''nef'' gene that down-regulates [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]], [[CD4]], and [[MHC class I]] expression; most non-human SIVs therefore do not induce immunodeficiency; the [[HIV-1]] ''nef'' gene however has lost its ability to down-regulate CD3, which results in the immune activation and apoptosis that is characteristic of chronic HIV infection.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Schindler M, Münch J, Kutsch O, ''et al.''|title=Nef-mediated suppression of T cell activation was lost in a lentiviral lineage that gave rise to HIV-1|journal=Cell|year=2006|volume=125|pages=1055–67|doi= 10.1016/j.cell.2006.04.033|pmid=16777597|issue=6}}</ref>

In addition, a long term survey of [[chimpanzee]]s naturally infected with SIVcpz in Gombe, [[Tanzania]], found that, contrary to the previous [[paradigm]], chimpanzees with SIVcpz infection do experience an increased mortality, and also suffer from a Human AIDS-like illness.<ref name=Keele2009>{{cite journal |author=Keele BF, Jones JH, Terio KA, Estes JD, Rudicell RS, ''et al.'' |title=Increased mortality and AIDS-like immunopathology in wild chimpanzees infected with SIVcpz |journal=Nature |volume=460 |issue=7254 |pages=515–19 |year=2009 |pmc=2872475 | pmid=19626114 |doi=10.1038/nature08200 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7254/full/nature08200.html |bibcode=2009Natur.460..515K}}</ref> SIV pathogenicity in wild animals could exist in other chimpanzee subspecies and other primate species as well, and stay unrecognized by lack of relevant long term studies.

===1959: David Carr===

David Carr was an apprentice printer (usually referred to, mistakenly, as a sailor; Carr had served in the Navy between 1955 and 1957) from Manchester, England who died in October 1959 following the failure of his immune system; he succumbed to pneumonia. Doctors, baffled by what he had died from, preserved 50 of his tissue samples for inspection. In 1990, the tissues were found to be HIV-positive. However, in 1992, a second test by AIDS researcher David Ho found that the strain of HIV present in the tissues was similar to those found in 1990 rather than an earlier strain (which would have mutated considerably over the course of 30 years). He concluded that the DNA samples provided actually came from a 1990 AIDS patient.

Because of the long incubation period of HIV (up to a decade or longer) before symptoms of AIDS appear, and because of the initially low incidence, HIV was not noticed at first.

===Canadian flight attendant theory===
{{main|Gaëtan Dugas}}
A Canadian [[airline steward]] named [[Gaëtan Dugas]] was referred to as "Patient 0" in an early AIDS study by Dr. [[William Darrow]] of the [[Centers for Disease Control]]. Because of this, many people had considered Dugas to be responsible for bringing HIV to North America. This is not accurate, however, as HIV had spread long before Dugas began his career. This rumor may have started with [[Randy Shilts]]' 1987 book ''[[And the Band Played On]]'' (and the 1993 movie based on it, in which Dugas is referred to as AIDS' [[Index case|Patient Zero]]), but neither the book nor the movie state that he had been the first to bring the virus to North America. He was called "Patient Zero" because at least 40 of the 248 people known to be infected by HIV in 1983 had had sex with him, or with someone who had sexual intercourse with him.

===1981: From GRID to AIDS===
The AIDS epidemic officially began on June 5, 1981, when the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in its ''[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]]'' newsletter reported unusual clusters of [[Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)]] caused by a form of [[Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)|''Pneumocystis carinii'']] (now recognized as a distinct species [[Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)|''Pneumocystis jirovecii'']]) in five homosexual men in Los Angeles.<ref name=MMWR2>{{cite journal |title=Pneumocystis pneumonia—Los Angeles |journal=MMWR Morb.

Over the next 18 months, more PCP clusters were discovered among otherwise healthy men in cities throughout the country, along with other opportunistic diseases (such as [[Kaposi's sarcoma]]<ref>{{cite journal |title=Update on Kaposi's sarcoma and opportunistic infections in previously healthy persons—United States |journal=MMWR Morb.

In June 1982, a report of a group of cases amongst gay men in [[Southern California]] suggested that a [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted]] [[infectious disease|infectious agent]] might be the [[etiology|etiological]] agent,<ref name="MMWR Weekly, 1982">{{cite journal |title=A cluster of Kaposi's sarcoma and ''Pneumocystis carinii'' pneumonia among homosexual male residents of Los Angeles and Orange Counties, California |journal=MMWR Morb.

Health authorities soon realized that nearly half of the people identified with the syndrome were not homosexual men.

By August 1982, the disease was being referred to by its new CDC-coined name: Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Marx JL |title=New disease baffles medical community |journal=Science |volume=217 |issue=4560 |pages=618–21 |year=1982 |month=August |pmid=7089584 |doi=10.1126/science.7089584 |bibcode = 1982Sci...217..618M }}</ref>

==Identification of the virus==

===May 1983: LAV===
In May 1983, doctors from Dr. [[Luc Montagnier]]'s team at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in France reported that they had isolated a new [[retrovirus]] from [[lymph node|lymphoid ganglions]] that they believed was the cause of AIDS.<ref name=Barre/> The virus was later named lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) and a sample was sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, which was later passed to the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI).<ref name=Barre>{{cite journal|author=Barré-Sinoussi, F., Chermann, J.

===May 1984: HTLV-III===
In May 1984 a team led by [[Robert Gallo]] of the United States confirmed the discovery of the virus, but they renamed it human T lymphotropic virus type III ([[HTLV-III#HTLV-III and HTLV-IV|HTLV-III]]).<ref name=Popovic>{{cite journal|author=Popovic, M., Sarngadharan, M.

===Jan 1985: both found to be the same===
In January 1985 a number of more detailed reports were published concerning LAV and HTLV-III, and by March it was clear that the viruses were the same, were from the same source, and were the etiological agent of AIDS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Marx JL |title=A virus by any other name . . |journal=Science |volume=227 |issue=4693 |pages=1449–51 |year=1985 |month=March |pmid=2983427 |doi=10.1126/science.2983427 |bibcode = 1985Sci...227.1449M }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Chang SY, Bowman BH, Weiss JB, Garcia RE, White TJ |title=The origin of HIV-1 isolate HTLV-IIIB |journal=Nature |volume=363 |issue=6428 |pages=466–9 |year=1993 |month=June |pmid=8502298 |doi=10.1038/363466a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v363/n6428/abs/363466a0.html|bibcode = 1993Natur.363..466C }}</ref>

===May 1986: the name HIV===
In May 1986, the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] ruled that both names should be dropped and a new name, HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), be used.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Coffin J, Haase A, Levy JA, ''et al.'' |title=What to call the AIDS virus? |journal=Nature |volume=321 |issue=6065 |page=10 |year=1986 |pmid=3010128 |doi=10.1038/321010a0 |bibcode = 1986Natur.321...10. }}</ref>

===Nobel===
Whether Gallo or Montagnier deserve more credit for the discovery of the virus that causes AIDS has been a matter of [[Robert Gallo#HIV/AIDS research and subsequent controversy|considerable controversy]].  Together with his colleague [[Françoise Barré-Sinoussi]], Montagnier was awarded one half of the 2008 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his "discovery of human immunodeficiency virus".<ref name="Nobel_2008">{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2008/index.html | title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2008 | accessdate=October 28, 2009 | publisher=Nobel Foundation

==Classification==
Since June 5, 1981, many definitions have been developed for [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] surveillance such as the [[1985 World Health Organization AIDS surveillance case definition|Bangui definition]] and the [[1994 expanded World Health Organization AIDS case definition]].

==Genetic studies==
According to a 2008 [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] study, a team led by Robert Shafer at [[Stanford University School of Medicine]] has discovered that the [[Gray Mouse Lemur]] has an [[endogenous]] [[lentivirus]] (the genus to which HIV belongs) in its genetic makeup. This suggests that lentiviruses have existed for at least 14 million years, much longer than the currently known existence of HIV. In addition, the time frame falls into place when Madagascar was still yet connected to what is now the African continent; the said lemurs later developed immunity to the virus strain and [[Middle Miocene disruption|survived an era]] when the lentivirus was widespread among other [[Mammals|mammalia]]. The study is being hailed as crucial, because it fills the blanks in the origin of the virus, as well as in its evolution, and may be important in the development of new antiviral drugs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gifford RJ, Katzourakis A, Tristem M, Pybus OG, Winters M, Shafer RW |title=A transitional endogenous lentivirus from the genome of a basal primate and implications for lentivirus evolution |journal=Proc.

== Discredited hypotheses ==
{{main|Discredited AIDS origins theories}}

Other hypotheses for the origin of AIDS have been proposed. [[AIDS denialism]] argues that HIV or AIDS does not exist or that AIDS is not caused by HIV; some of its proponents believe that AIDS is caused by lifestyle, including sexuality or drug use, and not by HIV. Some conspiracy theories allege that HIV was created in a bioweapons laboratory, perhaps as an agent of [[genocide]] or an accident. These hypotheses have been rejected by [[scientific consensus]].
