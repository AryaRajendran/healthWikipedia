'''Medical Scientist Training Programs''' (MSTPs) are extremely competitive [[MD/PhD]] training programs that streamline the education towards [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] [[Academic degree|graduate degree]] degrees. MSTPs are offered by a small number of [[United States]] medical schools with financial support from the [[National Institute of General Medical Sciences]] (NIGMS), a branch of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH). The goal of these training programs is to produce physician scientists who have the unique ability to translate laboratory discoveries into effective treatments for patients. There are currently 45  participating institutions with MSTPs for a total of 933 trainees in all stages of the programs.<ref name="MSTP">{{cite web|url=http://publications.nigms.nih.gov/multimedia/map/mstp/ |title=Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) Institutions - National Institute of General Medical Sciences |publisher=Publications.nigms.nih.gov |date=2011-08-16 |accessdate=2012-06-15}}</ref> MSTPs exist primarily at prominent medical schools, and, as of 2011, all top 20 medical school as ranked by the US News and Report had a MSTP. The most recent MSTP grant was awarded to [[The Ohio State University College of Medicine]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://medicalcenter.osu.edu/mediaroom/releases/Pages/Ohio-State%27s-College-of-Medicine-Advances-Medical-Scientist-Program.aspx/ |title=Ohio State's College of Medicine Advances Medical Scientist Program |publisher=Medicalcenter.osu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-15}}</ref>

==History==
The program has its origins in the non-NIH funded MD/PhD training offered at the nation's research-centric medical schools. The first true dual-degree program began at [[Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine]] in 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mstp.cwru.edu/ |title=CWRU Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) |publisher=cwru.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref> Other prominent medical schools quickly followed this example and developed explicit MD/PhD training structures. In 1964 the NIH created Medical Scientist Training Program to begin funding this medical and research education. The first programs to receive funding were at [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]], [[Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine]], and [[New York University School of Medicine]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} In the decades that followed, the MSTP saw a significant expansion in NIH funding and  institutions with MSTP designation.

==Admissions==

Admission to MSTPs is the most competitive of all graduate medical education programs, with only 170 NIH-funded positions available nationwide each year for 1,779 applicants (a 9.6% acceptance rate). In comparison MD-only programs had 42,742 applicants for 18,665 positions (a 44% acceptance rate).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Training/InstPredoc/PredocOverview-MSTP.htm |title=Medical Scientist Training Program - National Institute of General Medical Sciences |publisher=Nigms.nih.gov |date=2011-08-19 |accessdate=2012-06-15}}</ref> Applicants must have strong [[MCAT]] scores and [[GPA]]s to be considered for positions in MST programs. Reflecting this fact, from 2008 to 2010 the average GPA and MCAT for matriculants to MSTPs was 3.76 and 34.5, respectively. MSTP applicants will often have strong research experience as well.
Interviews at MSTPs tend to focus on the applicant's past experiences in scientific research. These may include short research talks or presentations followed by rigorous questioning by an interviewer or interviewing committee. At some MSTPs, applicants may also have to interview with the MD-only program.

==Financial Support==

MSTP matriculants receive substantial financial awards that make them financially competitive to their MD-only counterparts even with the longer training periods.  These allowances cover all tuition expenses, provide travel and supply allowances, and accommodate living expenses through an annual stipend (ranging from $22,000 to $33,000). Together, these monetary awards compare to approximately $200,000 of pre-tax income.

While MSTP-designated schools have NIH grant funding, a considerable portion of the financial support comes from the institution itself. Furthermore, this grant funding for each student expires before the completion of the program. Therefore, the institution must provide 100% of the funding at that time. For clarification, even with these financial changes, a MSTP student never sees a loss of funding (tuition or stipend).

Since MSTP grants are a type of National Research Service Award, students must be nationals (citizens or noncitizens) of the United States or possess a I-151 or I-551 alien registration receipt. However many MSTPs offer non-MSTP grant funded positions, allowing for non-citizens and non-legalized nationals to be accepted into the MD/PhD program at that particular school. These programs are indistuishable between the students besides the funding source. Furthermore, many non-MSTP medical schools have MD/PhD programs that are not supported by the NIH but offer similar training opportunities and grant money.

==Allied-Institution Programs==
Several MSTPs allow for the PhD portion of the MSTP to be completed outside the home university at an allied institution. These relationships provide additional and sometimes stronger research opportunities to students in these MSTPs.
