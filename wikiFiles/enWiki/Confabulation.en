Two distinct types of confabulation are often distinguished: spontaneous and provoked.

Spontaneous, or primary, confabulations do not occur in response to a cue<ref name="models of confabulation" /> and seem to be involuntary.<ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation">{{cite journal|last=Gilboa|first=A.|title=Mechanisms of spontaneous confabulations: a strategic retrieval account|journal=Brain|date=13 April 2006|volume=129|issue=6|pages=1399–1414|doi=10.1093/brain/awl093}}</ref> Spontaneous confabulation is relatively rare, may result from the interaction between frontal lobe pathology and organic amnesia, and is more common in cases of dementia.<ref name="ReferenceA">Kopelman, M.D. Two types of confabulation.

Provoked, momentary, or secondary, confabulation represents a normal response to a faulty memory and is common in both amnesia and dementia.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Provoked confabulations can become apparent during memory tests.<ref name="models of confabulation" /> Another distinction found in confabulations is that between verbal and behavioral. Verbal confabulations are spoken false memories and are more common, while behavioral confabulations occur when an individual acts on their false memories.<ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /> Confabulated memories of all types most often occur in [[autobiographical memory]], and are indicative of a complicated and intricate process that can be led astray at any point during [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]], [[Storage (memory)|storage]], or [[Recall (memory)|recall]] of a memory.<ref name=book/> This type of confabulation is commonly seen in [[Korsakoff's syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=D.

==Theories==
Theories of confabulation range in emphasis. Some theories propose that confabulations represent a way for memory-disabled individuals to maintain their self-identity.<ref name="models of confabulation">{{cite journal|last=Metcalf|first=Kasey|coauthors=Langdon, Robyn, Coltheart, Max|title=Models of confabulation: A critical review and a new framework|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|date=1 February 2007|volume=24|issue=1|pages=23–47|doi=10.1080/02643290600694901}}</ref> Other theories use neurocognitive links to explain the process of confabulation.<ref name="Spontaneous and Fantastic Review">{{cite journal|last=Glowinski|first=Remy|coauthors=Payman, Vahid, Frencham, Kate|title=Confabulation: a spontaneous and fantastic review|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry|date=1 January 2008|volume=42|issue=11|pages=932–940|doi=10.1080/00048670802415335}}</ref> Still other theories frame confabulation around the more familiar concept of delusion.<ref name="varieties of confabulation and delusion">{{cite journal|last=Kopelman|first=Michael D.|title=Varieties of confabulation and delusion|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry|date=1 January 2010|volume=15|issue=1-3|pages=14–37|doi=10.1080/13546800902732830}}</ref> Other researchers frame confabulation within the [[fuzzy-trace theory]].<ref name="fuzzy trace theory">{{cite journal|last=Brainerd|first=C.J.|coauthors=Reyna, V.F.|title=Fuzzy-Trace Theory and Children's False Memories|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|date=1 November 1998|volume=71|issue=2|pages=81–129|doi=10.1006/jecp.1998.2464}}</ref> Finally, some researchers call for theories that rely less on neurocognitive explanations and more on [[epistemic]] accounts.<ref name="faultless ignorance">{{cite journal|last=Bortolotti|first=Lisa|coauthors=Cox, Rochelle E.|title=‘Faultless’ ignorance: Strengths and limitations of epistemic definitions of confabulation|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|date=1 December 2009|volume=18|issue=4|pages=952–965|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2009.08.011}}</ref>

===Neuropsychological theories===
The most popular theories of confabulation come from the field of neuropsychology or cognitive neuroscience.<ref name="Spontaneous and Fantastic Review"/> Research suggests that confabulation is associated with dysfunction of cognitive processes that control the retrieval from long-term memory. Frontal lobe damage often disrupts this process, preventing the retrieval of information and the evaluation of its output.<ref>Baddeley, A.D &amp; Wilson, B. (1986) Amnesia, autobiographical memory and confabulation., (Editor): Rubin, D.C In: Autobiographical Memory. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 225–252.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Moscovitch M., Melo B. | year = 1997 | title = Strategic retrieval and the frontal lobes: evidence from confabulation and amnesia | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 1017–1034 }}</ref> Furthermore, researchers argue that confabulation is a disorder resulting from failed “reality monitoring/source monitoring” (i.e. deciding whether a memory is based on an actual event or whether it is imagined.<ref>Johnson, M.K. (1991). Reality monitoring: Evidence from confabulation in organic brain disease patients. In G.P. Prigatano & D.L. Schacter (Eds.), Awareness of deficit after brain injury (pp. 176-197). New York: Oxford.</ref> Some neuropsychologists suggest that errors in retrieval of information from long-term memory that are made by normal subjects involve different components of control processes than errors made by confabulators.<ref name="Burgess">Burgess, P. W. and Shallice, T. (1996) Confabulation and the control of recollection. Memory 4, 359–411.</ref> Detection of these errors are considered part of the Supervisory System,<ref>Norman, D.A., & Shallice, T. (1980). Attention to action. Willed and automatic control of behavior. University of California San Diego CHIP Report 99.</ref> which is believed to be a function of the frontal cortex.

===Self-identity theory===
Some argue confabulations have a self-serving, emotional component in those with memory deficits that aids to maintain a coherent, self-concept.<ref name="models of confabulation" /> In other words, individuals who confabulate are motivated to do so, because they have gaps in their memory that they want to fill in and cover up.

===Temporality theory===
Support for the temporality account suggests that confabulations occur when an individual is unable to place events properly in time.<ref name="models of confabulation" /> Thus, an individual might correctly state an action they performed, but say they did it yesterday, when they did it weeks ago. In the Memory, Consciousness, and Temporality Theory, confabulation occurs because of a deficit in temporal consciousness or awareness.<ref name="temporal theory">{{cite journal|last=Dalla Barba|first=Gianfranco|coauthors=Boissé, Marie-Françoise|title=Temporal consciousness and confabulation: Is the medial temporal lobe "temporal"?|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry|date=1 January 2010|volume=15|issue=1-3|pages=95–117|doi=10.1080/13546800902758017}}</ref>

===Monitoring theory===
Along a similar notion are the theories of reality and source monitoring theories.<ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /> In these theories, confabulation occurs when individuals incorrectly attribute memories as reality, or incorrectly attribute memories to a certain source. Thus, an individual might claim an imagined event happened in reality, or that their friend told them about an event, they actually heard about on television.

===Strategic retrieval account theory===
Supporters of the strategic retrieval account suggest that confabulations occur when an individual cannot actively monitor a memory for truthfulness after its retrieval.<ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /> An individual recalls a memory, but there is some deficit after recall that interferes with the person establishing its falseness.

===Executive control theory===
Still others propose that all types of false memories, including confabulation, fit into a general memory and executive function model.<ref name="varieties of false memory">{{cite journal|last=Kopelman|first=Michael D.|title=VARIETIES OF FALSE MEMORY|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|date=1 May 1999|volume=16|issue=3-5|pages=197–214|doi=10.1080/026432999380762}}</ref> In 2007, a framework for confabulation was proposed that stated confabulation is the result of two things: problems with executive control and problems with evaluation. In the executive control deficit, the incorrect memory is retrieved from the brain. In the evaluative deficit, the memory will be accepted as a truth due to an inability to distinguish a belief from an actual memory.<ref name="models of confabulation" />

===Confabulation in the context of delusion theories===
Recent models of confabulation have attempted to build upon the link between [[delusion]] and confabulation.<ref name="varieties of confabulation and delusion"/> More recently, a monitoring account for delusion, applied to confabulation, proposed both the inclusion of conscious and unconscious processing. The claim was that by encompassing the notion of both processes, spontaneous versus provoked confabulations could be better explained. In other words, there are two ways to confabulate. One is the unconscious, spontaneous way in which a memory goes through no logical, explanatory processing. The other is the conscious, provoked way in which a memory is recalled intentionally by the individual to explain something confusing or unusual.<ref name="confabulation and delusion">{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Martha|coauthors=Coltheart, Max|title=Confabulation and delusion: A common monitoring framework|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry|date=1 January 2010|volume=15|issue=1-3|pages=346–376|doi=10.1080/13546800903441902}}</ref>

===Fuzzy-trace theory===
[[Fuzzy-trace theory]], or FTT, is a concept more commonly applied to the explanation of judgment decisions.<ref name="fuzzy trace theory" /> According to this theory, memories are encoded generally (gist), as well as specifically (verbatim). Thus, a confabulation could result from recalling the incorrect verbatim memory or from being able to recall the gist portion, but not the verbatim portion, of a memory.

FTT uses a set of five principles to explain false-memory phenomena. Principle 1 suggests that subjects store verbatim information and gist information parallel to one another. Both forms of storage involve the surface content of an experience. Principle 2 shares factors of retrieval of gist and verbatim traces. Principle 3 is based on dual-opponent processes in false memory. Generally, gist retrieval supports false memory, while verbatim retrieval suppresses it. Developmental variability is the topic of Principle 4. As a child develops into an adult, there is obvious improvement in the acquisition, retention, and retrieval of both verbatim and gist memory. However, during late adulthood, there will be a decline in these abilities. Finally, Principle 5 explains that verbatim and gist processing cause vivid remembering. Fuzzy-trace Theory, governed by these 5 principles, has proved useful in explaining false memory and generating new predictions about it.<ref name="Fuzzy-Trace Theory and False Memory">Brainerd, C. J., & Reyna, V. F. (2002). Fuzzy-Trace Theory and False Memory. Current Directions In Psychological Science (Wiley–Blackwell), 11(5), 164–169.</ref>

===Epistemic theory===
However, not all accounts are so embedded in the neurocognitive aspects of confabulation. Some attribute confabulation to epistemic accounts.<ref name="faultless ignorance"/> In 2009, theories underlying the causation and mechanisms for confabulation were criticized for their focus on neural processes, which are somewhat unclear, as well as their emphasis on the negativity of false remembering. Researchers proposed that an epistemic account of confabulation would be more encompassing of both the advantages and disadvantages of the process.

==Presentation==

===Associated neurological and psychological conditions===
Confabulations are often symptoms of various syndromes and psychopathologies in the adult population including: [[Korsakoff's syndrome]], [[Alzheimer’s Disease]], [[Schizophrenia]], and [[traumatic brain injury]].

Wernicke–[[Korsakoff syndrome]] is a neurological disorder typically characterized by years of chronic alcohol abuse and a nutritional thiamine deficiency.<ref>Homewood, J., & Bond, N. W. (1999). Thiamin deficiency and Korsakoff’s syndrome: Failure to find memory impairments following nonalcoholic Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Alcohol, 19, 75–84.</ref> Confabulation is one salient symptom of this syndrome.<ref>Dalla Barba, G., Cipolotti, L., & Denes, G. (1990). Autobiographical memory loss and confabulation in Korsakoff’s syndrome: A case report. Cortex, 26, 525–534.</ref><ref>Kessels RP, Kortrijk HE, Wester AJ, Nys GM. Confabulation behavior and false memories in Korsakoff's syndrome: role of source memory and executive functioning. Psychiatry Clin Neurosci. 2008 Apr;62(2):220–5.</ref> A study on confabulation in Korsakoff’s patients found that they are subject to provoked confabulation when prompted with questions pertaining to [[episodic memory]], not [[semantic memory]], and when prompted with questions where the appropriate response would be “I don’t know.”<ref name="Korsakoff's">{{cite journal|last=Damme|first=Ilse|coauthors=d'Ydewalle, Géry|title=Confabulation versus experimentally induced false memories in Korsakoff patients|journal=Journal of Neuropsychology|year=2010|volume=4|issue=2|pages=211–230|doi=10.1348/174866409X478231}}</ref> This suggests that confabulation in these patients is “domain-specific.” Korsakoff’s patients who confabulate are more likely than healthy adults to falsely recognize distractor words, suggesting that false recognition is a “confabulatory behavior.”

[[Alzheimer’s Disease]] is a condition with both neurological and psychological components. It is a form of dementia associated with severe frontal lobe dysfunction. Confabulation in individuals with Alzheimer’s is often more spontaneous than it is in other conditions, especially in the advanced stages of the disease. Alzheimer’s patients demonstrate comparable abilities to encode information as healthy elderly adults, suggesting that impairments in encoding are not associated with confabulation.<ref name=Alzheimer>{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Janine M.|coauthors=Shanks, Michael F., Venneri, Annalena|title=Provoked confabulations in Alzheimer's disease|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=11 May 2006|volume=44|issue=10|pages=1697–1707|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.03.029}}</ref> However, as seen in Korsakoff's patients, confabulation in Alzheimer’s patients is higher when prompted with questions investigating episodic memory. Researchers suggest this is due to damage in the posterior cortical regions of the brain, which is a symptom characteristic of Alzheimer’s Disease.

[[Schizophrenia]] is a psychological disorder in which confabulation is sometimes observed. Although confabulation is usually coherent in its presentation, confabulations of schizophrenic patients are often delusional<ref>Wing, J. K., Cooper, J. E., [[Norman Sartorius|Sartorius, N.]] 1974. The description and classification of psychiatric symptoms: An instruction manual for the PSE and catego system. London: Cambridge University Press.</ref> Researchers have noted that these patients tend to make up delusions on the spot which are often fantastic and become increasingly elaborate with questioning.<ref>Lorente-Rovira , E. , Pomarol-Clotet , E. , McCarthy , R.A. , Berrios, G.E. , & McKenna , P.J. ( 2007 ). Confabulation in schizophrenia and its relationship to clinical and neuropsychological features of the disorder . Psychological Medicine , 1 – 10.</ref> Unlike patients with Korsakoff's and Alzheimer's, patients with schizophrenia are more likely to confabulate when prompted with questions regarding their semantic memories, as opposed to episodic memory prompting.<ref name=schizophrenia>{{cite journal|last=LORENTE-ROVIRA|first=E.|coauthors=SANTOS-GÓMEZ, J.L., MORO, M., VILLAGRÁN, J.M., MCKENNA, P.J.|title=Confabulation in schizophrenia: A neuropsychological study|journal=Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society|date=1 November 2010|volume=16|issue=06|pages=1018–1026|doi=10.1017/S1355617710000718}}</ref> In addition, confabulation does not appear to be related to any memory deficit in schizophrenic patients. This is contrary to most forms of confabulation. Also, confabulations made by schizophrenic patients often do not involve the creation of new information, but instead involve an attempt by the patient to reconstruct actual details of a past event.

[[Traumatic brain injury]] (TBI) can also result in confabulation. Research has shown that patients with damage to the inferior medial frontal lobe confabulate significantly more than patients with damage to the posterior area and healthy controls.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Martha S.|coauthors=Cipolotti, Lisa, Yousry, Tarek A., Shallice, Tim|title=Confabulation: Damage to a specific inferior medial prefrontal system|journal=Cortex|date=1 June 2008|volume=44|issue=6|pages=637–648|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2007.01.002}}</ref> This suggests that this region is key in producing confabulatory responses, and that memory deficit is important but not necessary in confabulation. Additionally, research suggests that confabulation can be seen in patients with frontal lobe syndrome, which involves an insult to the frontal lobe as a result of disease or traumatic brain injury (TBI).<ref>Baddeley, A.D. &Wilson, B. (1988). Frontal amnesia and the dysexecutive

Baddeley, A.D. (1996). Exploring the Central Executive. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 49A (1): 5–28.</ref> Finally, rupture of the anterior or posterior communicating artery, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and encephalitis are also possible causes of confabulation.<ref name="DallaBarba1993a">Dalla Barba, G.

(1986) Amnesia, autobiographical memory and confabulation., (Editor): Rubin, D.C In: Autobiographical Memory. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 225–252.</ref>

===Location of brain lesions===
Confabulation is believed to be a result of damage to the right frontal lobe of the brain.<ref name="Moscovitch"/> In particular, damage can be localized to the ventromedial frontal lobes and other structures fed by the anterior communicating artery (ACoA), including the basal forebrain, septum, fornix, cingulate gyrus, cingulum, anterior hypothalamus, and head of the caudate nucleus.<ref>Alexander MP, Freedman M. Amnesia after anterior communicating artery aneurysm rupture. Neurology 1984; 34: 752–7.</ref><ref>Irle E, Wowra B, Kunert HJ, Hampl J, Kunze S. Memory disturbances following anterior communicating artery rupture. Ann Neurol 1992; 31: 473–80.</ref>

===Developmental differences===
While some recent literature has suggested that older adults may be more susceptible than their younger counterparts to have false memories, the majority of research on forced confabulation centers around children.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brainerd |first=C.

Due to underdeveloped encoding and critical reasoning skills, children's ability to distinguish real memories from false memories may be impaired. It may also be that younger children lack the meta-memory processes required to remember confabulated versus non-confabulated events.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ghetti |first=Simona |coauthors=Castelli, Paola, Lyons, Kristen E. |title=Knowing about not remembering: developmental dissociations in lack-of-memory monitoring |journal=Developmental Science |year=2010 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=611–621 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00908.x}}</ref> Children's meta-memory processes may also be influenced by expectancies or biases, in that they believe that highly plausible false scenarios are not confabulated.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ghetti |first=Simona |coauthors=Alexander, Kristen Weede|title="If It Happened, I Would Remember It": Strategic Use of Event Memorability in the Rejection of False Autobiographical Events |journal=Child Development |year=2004 |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=542–561 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00692.x}}</ref> However, when knowingly being tested for accuracy, children are more likely to respond, “I don’t know” at a rate comparable to adults for unanswerable questions than they are to confabulate.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Roebers |first=Claudia |coauthors=Fernandez, Olivia |title=The Effects of Accuracy Motivation on Children's and Adults' Event Recall, Suggestibility, and Their Answers to Unanswerable Questions |journal=Journal of Cognition and Development|2002 |year=2002 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=415–443 |doi=10.1207/S15327647JCD3,4-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Scoboria|first=Alan|coauthors=Mazzoni, Giuliana, Kirsch, Irving|title="Don't know" responding to answerable and unanswerable questions during misleading and hypnotic interviews. |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied|2008 |year=2008 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=255–265 |doi=10.1037/1076-898X.14.3.255}}</ref> Ultimately, misinformation effects can be minimized by tailoring individual interviews to the specific developmental stage, often based on age, of the participant.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Holliday |first=Robyn E. |coauthors=Albon, Amanda J. |title=Minimising misinformation effects in young children with cognitive interview mnemonics |journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology |year=2004 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=263–281 |doi=10.1002/acp.973}}</ref>

===Provoked versus spontaneous confabulations===
There is evidence to support different cognitive mechanisms for provoked and spontaneous confabulation.<ref name="Provoked Versus Spontaneous">{{cite journal|last=Schnider|first=Armin|coauthors=von Däniken, Christine, Gutbrod, Klemens|title=The mechanisms of spontaneous and provoked confabulations|journal=Brain|date=19 February 1996|volume=119|issue=4|pages=1365–1375|doi=10.1093/brain/119.4.1365}}</ref> One study suggested that spontaneous confabulation may be a result of an amnesic patient’s inability to distinguish the chronological order of events in his memory. In contrast, provoked confabulation may be a compensatory mechanism, in which the patient tries to make up for his memory deficiency by attempting to demonstrate competency in recollection.

===Confidence in false memories===
Confabulation of events or situations may lead to an eventual acceptance of the confabulated information as true.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pickel|first=Kerri|title=When a lie becomes the truth: The effects of self‐generated misinformation on eyewitness memory|journal=Memory|year=2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=14–26|doi=10.1080/09658210244000072}}</ref> For instance, people who knowingly lie about a situation may eventually come to believe that their lies are truthful with time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Polage|first=Danielle C.|title=Fabrication deflation?

===Among normal subjects===
On rare occasions, confabulation can also be seen in normal subjects.<ref name="Burgess"/> It is currently unclear how completely healthy individuals produce confabulations. It is possible that these individuals are in the process of developing some type of organic condition that is causing their confabulation symptoms. It is not uncommon, however, for the general population to display some very mild symptoms of provoked confabulations. Subtle distortions and intrusions in memory are commonly produced by normal subjects when they remember something poorly.

==Diagnosis and treatment==
Spontaneous confabulations, due to their involuntary nature, cannot be manipulated in a laboratory setting.<ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /> However, provoked confabulations can be researched in various theoretical contexts. The mechanisms found to underlie provoked confabulations can be applied to spontaneous confabulation mechanisms. The basic premise of researching confabulation comprises finding errors and distortions in memory tests of an individual.

===Deese–Roediger–McDermott lists===
Confabulations can be detected in the context of the [[Deese–Roediger–McDermott paradigm]] by using the Deese–Roediger–McDermott lists.<ref name="True and False">{{cite journal|last=Howe|first=Mark L.|coauthors=Cicchetti, Dante, Toth, Sheree L., Cerrito, Beth M.|title=True and False Memories in Maltreated Children|journal=Child Development|date=1 September 2004|volume=75|issue=5|pages=1402–1417|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00748.x}}</ref> Participants listen to audio recordings of several lists of words centered around a theme, known as the critical word. The participants are later asked to recall the words on their list. If the participant recalls the critical word, which was never explicitly stated in the list, it is considered a confabulation. Participants often have a false memory for the critical word.

===Recognition tasks===
Confabulations can also be researched by using continuous recognition tasks.<ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /> These tasks are often used in conjunction with confidence ratings. Generally, in a recognition task, participants are rapidly presented with pictures. Some of these pictures are shown once; others are shown multiple times. Participants press a key if they have seen the picture previously. Following a period of time, participants repeat the task. More errors on the second task, versus the first, are indicative of confusion, representing false memories.

===Free recall tasks===
Confabulations can also be detected using a free recall task, such as a self-narrative task.<ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /> Participants are asked to recall stories ([[Semantic memory|semantic]] or [[Autobiographical memory|autobiographical]]) that are highly familiar to them. The stories recalled are encoded for errors that could be classified as distortions in memory. Distortions could include falsifying true story elements or including details from a completely different story. Errors such as these would be indicative of confabulations.

===Treatment===
Treatment for confabulation is somewhat dependent on the cause or source, if identifiable. For example, treatment of Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome involves large doses of vitamin B in order to reverse the thiamine deficiency.<ref>Spiegel, D., & Lim, K.J. 2011. A Case of Probable Korsakoff's Syndrome: A Syndrome of Frontal Lobe and Diencephalic Structural Pathogenesis and a Comparison with Medial Temporal Lobe Dementias. Innov Clin Neurosci. 2011 June; 8(6): 15–19.</ref> If there is no known physiological cause, more general cognitive techniques may be used to treat confabulation. In a recent case study, Self-Monitoring Training (SMT)<ref>B. Dayus and M.D. van den Broek. 2000. Treatment of stable delusional confabulations using self-monitoring training. NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION, 10 (4), 415–427.</ref> was shown to reduce delusional confabulations. Furthermore, improvements were maintained at a three-month follow-up and were found to generalize to everyday settings. Although this treatment seems promising, more rigorous research is necessary to determine its efficacy in the general confabulation population.

==Research==
Although significant gains have been made in the understanding of confabulation within recent years, there is still much to be learned. One group of researchers in particular has laid out several important questions for future study. They suggest that more information is necessary regarding the neural systems that support the different cognitive processes needed for normal source monitoring. They also proposed the idea of developing a standard neuropsychological test battery that is able to discriminate between the different types of confabulations. Furthermore, there is a considerable amount of debate regarding the best way to organize and combine neuroimaging, pharmacological, and cognitive/behavioral approaches to understand confabulation.<ref>Johnson, M. K., & Raye, C. L. (1998). False memories and confabulation: Trends in Cognitive Sciences Vol 2(4) Apr 1998, 137–145.</ref> 

In a recent review article, another group of researchers contemplate issues concerning the distinctions between delusions and confabulation. They question whether delusions and confabulation should be considered distinct or overlapping disorders and, if overlapping, to what degree? They also discuss the role of unconscious processes in confabulation. Some researchers suggest that unconscious emotional and motivational processes are potentially just as important as cognitive and memory problems. Finally, they raise the question of where to draw the line between the pathological and the nonpathological. Delusion-like beliefs and confabulation-like fabrications are commonly seen in healthy individuals. What are the important differences between patients with similar etiology who do and do not confabulate? Since the line between pathological and nonpathological is likely blurry, should we take a more dimensional approach to confabulation? Research suggests that confabulation occurs along a continuum of implausibility, bizarreness, content, conviction, preoccupation, and distress, and impact on daily life.<ref name=LangdonTurne2010>{{citation |date=January 2010 |author=Langdon, R. & Turner, M |title=Delusion and confabulation: Overlapping or distinct distortions in reality? |journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry |volume= 15 |issue=1 |pages= 1–13 |pmid=20043251 |accessdate=21 March 2012}}</ref>
