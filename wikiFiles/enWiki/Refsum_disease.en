==Classification==
Adult Refsum disease may be divided into the adult Refsum disease 1 and adult Refsum disease 2 subtypes. The former stems from mutations in the [[phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase]] (''PAHX'' aka ''PHYH'') gene, while the latter stems from mutations in the [[peroxin 7]] (''PEX7'') gene.<ref name=omim/>

Adult Refsum disease should not be confused with [[infantile Refsum disease]], a [[peroxisome biogenesis disorder]] resulting from deficiencies in the catabolism of very long chain fatty acids and branched chain fatty acids (such as [[phytanic acid]]) and [[plasmalogen]] biosynthesis.<ref name=omim/><ref>{{OMIM|266510}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
Individuals with Refsum disease present with neurologic damage, cerebellar degeneration, and peripheral neuropathy. Onset is most commonly in childhood/adolescence with a progressive course, although periods of stagnation or remission occur. Symptoms also include [[ataxia]], scaly skin ([[ichthyosis]]), difficulty hearing, and eye problems including cataracts and night blindness.

==Cause==
Refsum disease is a [[peroxisomal disorder]] caused by the impaired [[alpha-oxidation]] of branched chain fatty acids resulting in buildup of [[phytanic acid]] and its derivatives in the plasma and tissues. This may be due to deficiencies of [[phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase]] or [[peroxin-7]] activity. In general, Refsum disease is caused by ''PHYH'' mutations.

==Treatment==
Individuals with Refsum disease are commonly placed on a phytanic acid-restricted diet and avoid the consumption of fats from ruminant animals and certain fish.<ref name="ARD">{{cite web | last =National Institutes of Health | first = | title =Synonym(s): Phytanic Acid Storage Disease, Heredopathia Atactica Polyneuritiformis <Internet> | url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/refsum/refsum.htm | accessdate=8 July 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Baldwin |first=R.

==Biological sources of phytanic acid==
In ruminant animals, the gut fermentation of consumed plant materials liberates [[phytol]], a constituent of [[chlorophyll]], which is then converted to [[phytanic acid]] and stored in fats.<ref name="pmid9819701">{{cite pmid|9819701}}</ref> Although humans cannot derive significant amounts of phytanic acid from the consumption of chlorophyll present in plant materials, it has been proposed that the great apes (bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans) can derive significant amounts of [[phytanic acid]] from the [[hindgut fermentation]] of plant materials.<ref name="pmid20932325">{{cite pmid|20932325}}</ref>
