'''Te Rangi Hīroa''', also known as '''Sir Peter Henry Buck''', [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (ca. October 1877 &ndash; 1 December 1951), was a prominent member of the [[Ngati Mutunga|Ngāti Mutunga]] [[Māori people|Māori]] [[iwi]]. He was a doctor, military leader, health administrator, politician, anthropologist and museum director.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Urenui]], [[New Zealand]], the only child of William Henry Buck. He was raised by William and his wife Ngarongo-ki-tua, though she was not his biological mother. According to local custom, when the couple found themselves unable to have children, one of Ngarongo's relatives, Rina, became part of the household and produced a child for the couple. Rina died soon after her child was born, and Ngarongo raised Peter as her own. He claimed to have been born in 1880, but it is more likely that an entry in the primary school register pointing to October 1877 is correct.<ref name="DNZB updateme">{{cite web | url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/3b54/1 | title= Buck, Peter Henry - Biography | last= Sorrenson | first= M. P. K. | date= updated 1 September 2010 |publisher= [[Dictionary of New Zealand Biography]] | accessdate= 11 December 2010}}</ref>

Te Rangi Hīroa was descended on his Māori (maternal) side from the [[Taranaki (iwi)|Taranaki]] iwi of Ngati Mutunga, whose elders renamed him Te Rangi Hīroa in honour of a notable ancestor. His paternal ancestry was English and Irish. Though he was largely brought up within the [[Pākehā]] community, Ngarongo-ki-tua and his great aunt Kapuakore instilled a love of Māori tradition and [[Māori language|language]] in him.

After Ngarongo's death in 1892 he moved with his father to the [[Wairarapa]]. In 1896 he started attending [[Te Aute College]], a school that produced many Māori leaders of the time. In 1899 he was named dux and passed a medical examination, entitling him to attend the [[University of Otago]] Medical School. He was later associated with the [[Young Māori Party]].

==Medical school and practice==

Buck did well at Otago Medical School, where he also excelled in sport, becoming national [[long jump]] champion in 1900 and 1903. He completed his MB and ChB in 1904, and an MD six years later. During this time, in 1905, he married Irish-born Margaret Wilson. Their long marriage was often fiery, but was strong, and it was Margaret who often gave the impetus to Peter's career.

In November 1905 Buck was appointed as a medical officer to Māori, working under [[Maui Pomare]], initially in the southern [[North Island]], then in the far north. Between them Pomare and Buck campaigned successfully to improve sanitation in the small Māori communities around the country.

Buck was singled out by Native Minister [[James Carroll (New Zealand politician)|James Carroll]] to be his replacement.

During the [[First World War]], Buck helped in the recruitment of a Māori volunteer contingent. Buck joined this contingent as medical officer, travelling to the Middle East in 1915. He took part at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], later being awarded a [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his heroism. He later saw action in France and Belgium, before being posted to the No 3 New Zealand General Hospital at [[Codford]], [[England]] in 1918.

Returning to New Zealand, Buck was appointed as Chief Maori Medical Officer, and in 1921 was named director of the Maori Hygiene Division in the Department of Health.
