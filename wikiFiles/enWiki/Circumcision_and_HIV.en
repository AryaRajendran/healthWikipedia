 |quote=Thirty-five articles and a number of abstracts have been published in the medical literature looking at the relationship between male circumcision and HIV infection. Study designs have included geographical analysis, studies of high-risk patients, partner studies and random population surveys. Most of the studies have been conducted in Africa. A meta-analysis was performed on the 29 published articles where data were available. When the raw data are combined, a man with a circumcised penis is at greater risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV than a man with a non-circumcised penis (odds ratio (OR)=1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.01-1.12). Based on the studies published to date, recommending routine circumcision as a prophylactic measure to prevent HIV infection in Africa, or elsewhere, is scientifically unfounded.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal

 |quote=The results from this re-analysis thus support the contention that male circumcision may offer protection against HIV infection, particularly in high-risk groups where genital ulcers and other STDs 'drive' the HIV epidemic.  A systematic review is required to clarify this issue. Such a review should be based on an extensive search for relevant studies, published and unpublished, and should include a careful assessment of the design and methodological quality of studies. Much emphasis should be given to the exploration of possible sources of heterogeneity. In view of the continued high prevalence and incidence of HIV in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the question of whether circumcision could contribute to prevent infections is of great importance, and a sound systematic review of the available evidence should be performed without delay. }}</ref><ref name="Siegfriedmeta">{{cite journal

 |quote=We found insufficient evidence to support an interventional effect of male circumcision on HIV acquisition in heterosexual men. The results from existing observational studies show a strong epidemiological association between male circumcision and prevention of HIV, especially among high-risk groups. However, observational studies are inherently limited by confounding which is unlikely to be fully adjusted for. In the light of forthcoming results from RCTs, the value of IPD analysis of the included studies is doubtful. The results of these trials will need to be carefully considered before circumcision is implemented as a public health intervention for prevention of sexually transmitted HIV.

 |quote=Male circumcision is associated with a significantly reduced risk of HIV infection among men in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly those at high risk of HIV. These results suggest that consideration should be given to the acceptability and feasibility of providing safe services for male circumcision as an additional HIV prevention strategy in areas of Africa where men are not traditionally circumcised.

In 1995 Ntozi noted: "There are now two schools of thought about the link between lack of circumcision and HIV infection in Africa. One school is that of Bongaarts et al. (1989), Moses et al. (n.d.) and Caldwell and Caldwell (1994) who use geographical distribution evidence to argue that the association between lack of circumcision and a high level of HIV infection in Africa is so convincing that the likelihood of a link should be recognized and taken into account where possible in the battle against AIDS. Moses et al. (n.d.) have gone further to recommend circumcision interventions for Africa. In contrast, De Vincenzi and Mertens (1994) argue that the evidence for an association, at least from small-scale surveys, is doubtful and hence not conclusive enough to qualify circumcision as an intervention.<ref>{{cite journal

Van Howe conducted a meta-analysis in 1999 and found circumcised men at a greater risk for HIV infection.<ref name="VanHoweHIVmeta" /> He further speculated that circumcision may be responsible for the increased number of partners, and therefore, the increased risk. Van Howe's work was reviewed by O'Farrell and Egger (2000) who said Van Howe used an inappropriate method for combining studies, stating that re-analysis of the same data revealed that the presence of the foreskin was associated with increased risk of HIV infection (fixed effects OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.32 to 1.54; random effects OR 1.67, 1.25 to 2.24).<ref>{{cite journal |author=O'Farrell N, Egger M |title=Circumcision in men and the prevention of HIV infection: a 'meta-analysis' revisited |journal=Int J STD AIDS |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=137–42 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10726934 |url=http://ijsa.rsmjournals.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10726934 |quote=The results from this re-analysis thus support the contention that male circumcision may offer protection against HIV infection, particularly in high-risk groups where genital ulcers and other STDs 'drive' the HIV epidemic.

(1999) also criticised Van Howe's paper, stating that his results were a case of "[[Simpson's paradox]], which is a type of confounding that can occur in epidemiological analyses when data from different strata with widely divergent exposure levels are combined, resulting in a combined measure of association that is not consistent with the results for each of the individual strata." They concluded that, contrary to Van Howe's assertion, the evidence that lack of circumcision increases the risk of HIV "appears compelling".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moses S, Nagelkerke NJ, Blanchard J |title=Analysis of the scientific literature on male circumcision and risk for HIV infection |journal=International journal of STD & AIDS |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages=626–8 |year=1999 |month=September |pmid=10492434 |doi= 10.1258/0956462991914681|url=http://ijsa.rsmjournals.com/cgi/reprint/10/9/626?ijkey=a1ca8d961969d1a6970456a1a43f7ac7aa24304a&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha | format= PDF}}</ref>

These results suggest that consideration should be given to the acceptability and feasibility of providing safe services for male circumcision as an additional HIV prevention strategy in areas of Africa where men are not traditionally circumcised."

The USAID document summarised research as of September 2002. It states:

:A systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 published studies by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, published in the journal AIDS in 2000, found that circumcised men are less than half as likely to be infected by HIV as uncircumcised men. A subanalysis of 10 African studies found a 71 percent reduction among higher-risk men. A September 2002 update considered the results of these 28 studies plus an additional 10 studies and, after controlling for various potentially confounding religious, cultural, behavioral, and other factors, had similarly robust findings. Recent laboratory studies in Chicago found HIV uptake in the inner foreskin tissue to be up to nine times more efficient than in a control sample of cervical tissue.<ref>{{cite conference

Siegried ''et al.'' (2003) surveyed 35 observational studies relating to HIV and circumcision: 16 conducted in the general population and 19 in high-risk populations. They state:

:We found insufficient evidence to support an interventional effect of male circumcision on HIV acquisition in heterosexual men. The results from existing observational studies show a strong epidemiological association between male circumcision and prevention of HIV, especially among high-risk groups. However, observational studies are inherently limited by confounding which is unlikely to be fully adjusted for. In the light of forthcoming results from RCTs, the value of IPD analysis of the included studies is doubtful. The results of these trials will need to be carefully considered before circumcision is implemented as a public health intervention for prevention of sexually transmitted HIV.<ref name="Siegfried2003">{{cite journal |author=Siegfried N, Muller M, Volmink J, ''et al'' |editor1-last=Siegfried |editor1-first=Nandi |title=Male circumcision for prevention of heterosexual acquisition of HIV in men |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD003362 |year=2003 |pmid=12917962 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003362 |url=}}</ref>

In 2005, Siegfried ''et al.'' published a review including 37 observational studies. Most studies indicated an association between lack of circumcision and increased risk of HIV, but the quality of evidence was judged insufficient to warrant implementation of circumcision as a public health measure. The authors stated that the results of the three randomised controlled trials then underway would therefore provide essential evidence about the effects of circumcision as an HIV intervention.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Siegfried N, Muller M, Deeks J, ''et al'' |title=HIV and male circumcision--a systematic review with assessment of the quality of studies |journal=The Lancet infectious diseases |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=165–73 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15766651 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(05)01309-5 |url=}}</ref>

Kiwanuka ''et al.'''s (1996) study on the relationship between religion and HIV in rural Uganda was presented at the 1996 10th ''International AIDS Conference'' He said that: "Lower rates of HIV infection among [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]] appear to be associated with less [[alcohol]] consumption, [[sexual abstinence]] and fewer sexual partners, whereas the low HIV prevalence in [[Muslim]]s appears to be associated with low reported alcohol consumption and male circumcision." Muslims, despite having the lowest rate of sexual abstinence and the highest rate of having two or more sexual partners, had the lowest level of HIV infection compared with the other religious groups in the study ([[Catholic Church|Catholics]], [[Protestantism|Protestants]], and Pentecostals). The factor in common between the Muslims (14.5% seropositive) and the Pentecostals (14.6% seropositive) was the lower alcohol consumption rate in these two groups than amongst Protestants (19.2%) and Catholics (19.9%).<ref>{{cite conference

Kelly ''et al.'' (1999) investigated the age of male circumcision and risk of prevalent HIV infection in rural Uganda and found that circumcision before the age of 12 resulted in a reduction to 0.39 of the odds of being infected. The degree of protection varied with the age at which circumcision was performed. Those circumcised at between 13 and 20 years had an odds ratio of 0.46, and those circumcised after the age of 20 at an odds ratio of 0.78. They concluded: "Prepubertal circumcision is associated with reduced HIV risk, whereas circumcision after age 20 years is not significantly protective against HIV-1 infection."<ref>{{cite journal

Buvé and colleagues (1999) investigated the reasons why the HIV prevalence rate among pregnant women in many large towns in Central, East and southern Africa was higher (>30%) than in the cities and towns of most of West Africa (<10%). Between June 1997 and March 1998 surveys were carried out and blood samples were taken in 4 sites. Kisumu (Kenya) and Ndola (Zambia), in Central/East Africa, were selected as the towns with high HIV prevalence, while the low-prevalence towns in West Africa were Cotonou (Benin) and Yaoundé (Cameroon).  "In conclusion, differences in the rate of HIV spread between the East African and West African cities studied cannot be explained away by differences in sexual behaviour alone. In fact, behavioural differences seem to be outweighed by differences in HIV transmission probability."<ref>{{cite journal

Bailey et al. (1999) interviewed 188 circumcised and 177 uncircumcised consenting Ugandan men in one of four native languages during April and May, 1997.  Non-[[Muslim]] circumcised men were found to have a higher risk profile than uncircumcised men.  Muslims generally had a lower risk profile than other circumcised men except they were less likely to have ever used a condom  or to have used a condom during the last sex encounter. Bailey et al. concluded that "these results suggest that differences between circumcised and uncircumcised men in their sex practices and hygienic behaviors do not account for the higher risk of HIV infection found among uncircumcised men. Further consideration should be given to male circumcision as a prevention strategy in areas of high prevalence of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Studies of the feasibility and acceptability of male circumcision in traditionally non-circumcising societies are warranted."<ref>{{cite journal

Bonner (2001) reserved caution over using circumcision to prevent HIV: "Until we know why and how circumcision is protective, exactly what the relationship is between circumcision status and other STIs, and whether the effect
seen in high-risk populations is generalisable to other groups, the wisest course is to recommend risk
reduction strategies of proven efficacy, such as condom use."<ref>{{cite journal

Bailey ''et al.'' looked at the possible adverse effects of introducing male circumcision on a public health scale and the post operative satisfaction levels of 380 circumcisions on 18-24 year old consenting men. As to satisfaction; "At 30 days post-surgery, 99.3% of men reported being very satisfied and 0.7% somewhat satisfied with circumcision. None were dissatisfied." And with regard to adverse effects; "All were mild or moderate and resolved within hours or several days of detection."

Van Howe ''et al.'' criticise the drive to promote circumcision in Africa, asking "Why are circumcision proponents expending so much time and energy promoting mass circumcision to North Americans when their supposed aim is to prevent HIV in Africa? The circumcision rate is declining in the US, especially on the west coast; the two North American national paediatric organisations have elected not to endorse the practice, and the practice’s legality has been questioned in both the medical and legal literature. ‘Playing the HIV card’ misdirects the fear understandably generated in North Americans by the HIV/AIDS pandemic into a concrete action: the perpetuation of the outdated practice of neonatal circumcision."<ref>{{cite journal

==Randomized controlled trials==
[[Africa]] has a higher [[List of countries by HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate|rate of adult HIV infection]] than anywhere else in the world.  Three [[randomized controlled trial]]s were commissioned in Africa to investigate whether circumcision could lower the rate of HIV contraction.

The first study to be published was named ANRS-1265.  It was funded by the French government’s research agency, Agence Nationale de Recherches sur la SIDA (ANRS) and carried out in [[Orange Farm, Gauteng]] in [[South Africa]].  The purpose was to test the effect of adult male circumcision on HIV acquisition.<ref name=NIAIDQA>{{cite web

The principal investigator was Dr. Bertran Auvert of [[Versailles University]]. The study enrolled 3,274 men aged 18–24.  The participants were split into two equal groups.  One group was circumcised straight away; the other group, serving as a control, was to be circumcised 21 months later. 146 of the original participants were found to have HIV at the start of the trial - to avoid stigmatization, they were not excluded.  It was planned that all the men would visit the research clinic four times during this 21-month period, and that they would be tested for HIV each time. They were instructed not to have sex for six weeks after the operation, and asked at each clinic visit to provide detailed information about their sexual activity. The circumcision procedure used was the forceps-guided method,<ref>http://www.phru.co.za/pdf/circumcision/pitfalls.pdf</ref> carried out by three local general practitioners in their surgical offices.  After 17 months, 20 men had contracted HIV in the circumcised group and 49 in the control group.  The trial was halted on ethical grounds. The results of the trial were published in November 2005.<ref name = "ANRS">{{cite journal

The authors said, “Male circumcision provides a degree of protection against acquiring HIV infection, equivalent to what a vaccine of high efficacy would have achieved. Male circumcision may provide an important way of reducing the spread of HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa.”<ref name = "ANRS"/>

Williams ''et al.''(2006) looked at the potential impact of circumcision on HIV in Africa, based upon the South African RCT, saying that that male circumcision (MC) could substantially reduce the burden of HIV in Africa, particularly in southern Africa where the existing prevalence of male circumcision is low and the existing prevalence of HIV is high.  More specifically it predicted that if full coverage with MC was achieved in sub-Saharan Africa over the next ten years, MC could prevent approximately 2.0 (1.1 to 3.8) million new HIV infections over that ten-year period and a further 3.7 million in the ten years after that.<ref name = "PLoS-7-06">{{cite journal

The above conclusions drawn from the Orange Farm study have been criticised by Michel Garenne (2006) of the [[Institut Pasteur]]. In his critique, published in the PLOS Medicine, he concludes that: "'male circumcision should be regarded as an important public health intervention for preventing the spread of HIV' appears overstated. Even though large-scale male circumcision could avert a number of HIV infections, theoretical calculations and empirical evidence show that it is unlikely to have a major public health impact, apart from the fact that achieving universal male circumcision is likely to be more difficult than universal vaccination coverage or universal contraceptive use."<ref name = "Garenne"/>

Mills and Siegfried (2006) point out that trials that are stopped early tend to overestimate treatment effects.
They argued that a meta-analysis should be done before further feasibility studies are done.<ref>{{cite journal

The [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases|NIAID]], part of the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]], supported two further trials, conducted in Kenya and in Uganda.  The primary objectives of these studies were to determine whether adult male circumcision can be administered safely, and whether it would reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection through heterosexual contact.<ref name = "NIAIDQA"/>  After an initial HIV screening and a medical exam, eligible men were randomly assigned either to receive circumcision immediately or to wait two years before circumcision. All participants were closely followed for two years to collect information about their health, sexual activity, and their and their partners’ attitudes about circumcision; to counsel participants in HIV prevention and safe sex practices; and to check the HIV status of the volunteer. Participants in the Kenyan study were scheduled for six visits over the two-year follow-up, compared with four visits for the Ugandan trial participants. In addition to the study visits, men enrolled in the Kenyan trial were encouraged to receive all of their outpatient health care at the study clinics, which enabled researchers to collect information on the safety of the procedure and the number of other sexually transmitted diseases the men had during follow-up.

The Kenyan trial, also known as the UNIM trial (Universities of Nairobi, Illinois and Manitoba trial), began in February 2002, in [[Kisumu]], [[Kenya]]. It was a collaborative effort between US, Canadian and Kenyan researchers, led by Dr. Robert Bailey, of the [[University of Illinois]]. Also involved were Stephen Moses, [[University of Manitoba]], Jeckoniah Ndinya-Achola, [[University of Nairobi]], and Kwango Agot, [[UNIM]].  The trial was funded by the NIAID and the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]]. This trial enrolled 2,784 men between 18 and 24 years old.  The participants were assessed by HIV testing, medical examinations, and behavioural interviews during follow-ups at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.  The circumcision procedure used in the Ugandan trial is known as the sleeve method and takes about 30 minutes. The Ugandan trial used cauterization of the blood vessels to control bleeding and stitches to close the wound.  22 men in the intervention group and 47 in the control group had tested positive for HIV when the study was stopped on ethical grounds.

The Ugandan trial began August, 2003 in [[Rakai District|Rakai]], [[Uganda]], with 4,996 men aged between 15 and 49 years old.<ref>http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/InSite?page=jl-11-03 Male Circumcision for HIV Prevention in Men in Rakai, Uganda: A Randomised Trial</ref>  It was led by Ronald Gray and Maria Wawer of [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]] and  David Serwadda and Nelson Sewankambo of [[Makerere University]] in [[Kampala]], Uganda. The circumcision procedure used in the Kenyan trial was the foreskin clamp method. The Kenyan trial procedure took about 25 minutes and used stitches to control bleeding and improve wound closure.  Trained and certified physicians performed the circumcisions in well-equipped operating rooms. Post-operative follow-up visits were scheduled at 24–48 hours, 5–9 days, and 4–6 weeks. HIV testing, physical examination, and interviews were repeated at 4–6 weeks, 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up visits.<ref>{{cite web

On Wednesday, March 28, 2007, the [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO) and [[UNAIDS]] issued joint recommendations concerning male circumcision and HIV/AIDS.<ref name="WHOpr0307"/>  These recommendations are:

* Male circumcision should now be recognized as an efficacious intervention for HIV prevention.
* Promoting male circumcision should be recognized as an additional, important strategy for the prevention of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men.<ref name="WHO-C&R" />

Kim Dickson, coordinator of the working group that authored the report, commented:
* Male circumcision "would have greatest impact" in countries where the HIV infection rate among heterosexual males is greater than 15 percent and fewer than 20 percent of males are circumcised.
* WHO further recommends that the procedure must be done by a trained physician.
* Protection is incomplete and men must continue to use condoms and have fewer partners.
* Newly circumcised men should abstain from sex for at least six weeks.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn11481&feedId=online-news_rss20 | title = WHO hails circumcision as vital in HIV fight | accessdate = 2008-09-18 | date = March 28, 2007 | publisher = [[New Scientist]]}}</ref>

The World Health Organization (WHO) said: “Although these results demonstrate that male circumcision reduces the risk of men becoming infected with HIV, the UN agencies emphasize that it does not provide complete protection against HIV infection. Circumcised men can still become infected with the virus and, if HIV-positive, can infect their sexual partners. Male circumcision should never replace other known effective prevention methods and should always be considered as part of a comprehensive prevention package, which includes correct and consistent use of male or female condoms, reduction in the number of sexual partners, delaying the onset of sexual relations, and HIV testing and counselling.”<ref name="WHOsec">{{cite web | url = http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2007/s04/en/index.html | title = WHO and UNAIDS Secretariat welcome corroborating findings of trials assessing impact of male circumcision on HIV risk | accessdate = 2007-02-23 | date = February 23, 2007 | publisher = World Health Organization}}</ref>

Others have also expressed concern that some may mistakenly believe they will be fully protected against HIV through circumcision and see circumcision as a safe alternative to other forms of protection, such as condoms.<ref>{{cite web

Dowsett et al. urged caution over using circumcision as a HIV prevention strategy saying that there were still questions that needed to be answered: "We need to investigate the effects of those other social and contextual factors that will be in play in real world settings – because the effectiveness of male circumcision will not be generated by the efficacy of the surgery alone."  He contrasts the preventative effect of circumcision taken from the RCT's (55%) with the preventative effect of condoms (80-90%).  He criticises the fact that the trials were not double-blinded - the participants knew their circumcision status and so this could have affected how the men responded behaviourally, psychologically and sexually.  He criticised the randomisation measures used in the trial: sexual practices (number of partners, condom use) and sexual health measures (presence of STIs), saying that  "Effective measures were not used, and differences related to sexual subjectivity, such as sexual network participation, pleasure preferences, body image, sexual history effects (e.g. abuse), partner preferences (younger, older, peers, groups) and so on were never assessed or analysed."  He also asks how the extensive counselling and education might have influenced the participants' sexual activity.  He adds that "all participants were subject to
regular monitoring (e.g. behaviour surveys, clinical check-ups), which clearly might have enhanced compliance with suggested safety regimes and lowered risk-taking during the follow-up period. Such compliance cannot be
guaranteed in real world settings."  He also said the trials were subject to the [[Hawthorne effect]].<ref name="Dowsett2007">{{cite journal |last=Dowsett |first=G.W. |coauthors=M.

An interim analysis from the Rakai Health Sciences Program in Uganda suggested that newly circumcised HIV positive men may be more likely to spread HIV to their female partners if they have sexual intercourse before the wound is fully healed. “Because the total number of men who resumed sex before certified wound healing is so small, the finding of increased transmission after surgery may have occurred by chance alone. However, we need to err on the side of caution to protect women in the context of any future male circumcision programme,” said Maria Wawer, the study's principal investigator.<ref>{{cite web

(2007) argue that any protective effects circumcision could offer would be partially offset by increased HIV risk behavior, or “risk compensation" including reduction in condom use or increased numbers of sex partners.  They note that circumcised men in the South African trial had 18% more sexual contacts than uncircumcised men at follow-up.  They also said that because participants were given ongoing risk-reduction counseling and free condoms, it "reduced the utility of these trials for estimating the potential behavioral impact of male circumcision when implemented in a natural setting."  They also criticised current models for failing to account for increased HIV risk behaviour.  Increased HIV risk behaviour would mean more women would be infected which would consequently increase the risk of men.  It would also mean that non-HIV STI's, which have been associated with increased HIV risk, would increase.<ref name="kalichman">{{cite journal

==Estimated impact of circumcision programs==

Modelling of the population-level impact of circumcision has shown mixed results.  Podder ''et al.'' found that although circumcision would not eliminate HIV, it would "significantly reduce" the HIV burden in a population, stating that reduction was more effective when circumcision was combined with anti-retroviral drugs than with [[condom]]s.  Disease elimination was considered feasible when all interventions were combined.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Podder CN, Sharomi O, Gumel AB, Moses S |title=To cut or not to cut: a modeling approach for assessing the role of male circumcision in HIV control |journal=Bull.

Studies of the cost-effectiveness of circumcision programmes have been similarly mixed.  Kahn ''et al.'' studied sub-Saharan African settings with a high or moderate HIV prevalence, reporting that adult circumcision is "likely to be a cost-effective HIV prevention strategy" even when deployed among only a small fraction of the population.  The authors concluded that circumcision "generates large net savings after adjustment for averted HIV medical costs".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kahn JG, Marseille E, Auvert B |title=Cost-effectiveness of male circumcision for HIV prevention in a South African setting |journal=PLoS Med |year=2006 |volume=3 |issue=12 |pages=e157 |pmid=17194197 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030517 |pmc=1716193}}</ref> White ''et al.'' concluded that circumcision "is a cost-saving intervention in a wide range of scenarios of HIV and initial circumcision prevalence but the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS/WHO recommended target age group should be widened to include older HIV-uninfected men and counselling should be targeted at both newly and already circumcised men to minimize risk compensation".<ref>{{cite journal |author=White RG, Glynn JR, Orroth KK, Freeman EE, Bakker R, Weiss HA, Kumaranayake L, Habbema JD, Buvé A, Hayes RJ |title=Male circumcision for HIV prevention in sub-Saharan Africa: who, what and when? |journal=AIDS |year=2008 |volume=22 |issue=14 |pages=1841–50 |pmid=18753931 |doi=10.1097/QAD.0b013e32830e0137}}</ref> The UNAIDS/WHO/SACEMA Expert Group on Modelling the Impact and Cost of Male Circumcision for HIV Prevention found "large benefits" of circumcision in settings with high HIV prevalence and low circumcision prevalence.

Dowsett (2007) questioned why it was just males that were being encouraged to circumcise: "Langerhans cells occur in the [[clitoris]], the [[labia]] and in other parts of both male and female genitals, and no one is talking of removing these in the name of HIV prevention."<ref name="Dowsett2007"/>
