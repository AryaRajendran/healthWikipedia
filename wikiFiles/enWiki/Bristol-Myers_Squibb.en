'''Bristol-Myers Squibb''', often referred to as '''BMS''', is a [[pharmaceutical company]], headquartered in New York City.  The company was formed in 1989, following the merger of its predecessors Bristol-Myers and the Squibb Corporation.  Squibb was founded in 1858 by [[Edward Robinson Squibb]] in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], New York, while Bristol-Myers was founded in 1887 by [[William McLaren Bristol]] and [[John Ripley Myers]] in [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton]], New York (both were graduates of [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]]).

Bristol-Myers Squibb manufactures prescription pharmaceuticals in several therapeutic areas, including cancer, HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis and psychiatric disorders.  Its mission is to "discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases."

BMS' primary R&D sites are located in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] (formerly Squibb) and [[Wallingford, Connecticut]] (formerly Bristol-Myers), with other sites in Hopewell and New Brunswick, New Jersey, and in Braine-l'Alleud, Belgium, Tokyo, and Bangalore, India.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bristol-Myers Squibb and Biocon’s Syngene open new R&D Facility at Biocon Park|url=http://www.bmsi.co.in/bbrc.aspx?section=2|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref>

==History==
In 1999, President Clinton awarded Bristol-Myers Squibb the [[National Medal of Technology]], the nation's highest recognition for technological achievement, "for extending and enhancing human life through innovative pharmaceutical research and development and for redefining the science of clinical study through groundbreaking and hugely complex clinical trials that are recognized models in the industry." In 2005, BMS was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Drinkard |title=Donors get good seats, great access this week |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-01-16-inauguration-donors_x.htm |work=USA Today | date=January 17, 2005 | accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref>

A major restructuring involves focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, along with productivity initiatives and cost-cutting and streamlining business operations through a multi-year program of on-going layoffs.  As another cost-cutting measure Bristol-Myers also reduced subsidies for health-care to retirees and plans to freeze their pension plan at the end of 2009.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In August 2009, BMS acquired the [[biotechnology]] firm [[Medarex]] as part of the company's "String of Pearls" strategy of alliances, partnerships and acquisitions.<ref>http://finance.yahoo.com/news/BristolMyers-Squibb-to-bw-571310065.html?x=0&.v=1</ref>

In November 2009, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that it was "splitting off" Mead Johnson Nutrition by offering BMY shareholders the opportunity to exchange their stock for shares in Mead Johnson. According to Bristol-Myers Squibb, this move was expected to further sharpen the company's focus on biopharmaceuticals. 

BMS is a Fortune 500 Company (#114 in 2010 list). Newsweek's 2009 Green Ranking recognized Bristol-Myers Squibb as 8th among 500 of the largest United States corporations. Also, BMS was included in the 2009 Dow Jones Sustainability [[North America]] Index of leading sustainability-driven companies. 

In October 2010, the company acquired ZymoGenetics, securing an existing product as well as pipeline assets in hepatitis C, cancer and other therapeutic areas.

Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. agreed to pay around $2.5 billion in cash to buy Inhibitex Inc. in concern to compete with [[Gilead]]/[[Pharmasset]] to produce [[Hepatitis C]] drugs. The settlement will be finished in 2 months for its Inhibitex's shareholders acceptance of 126 percent premium price of its price over the previous 20 trading days ended at January 6, 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.businessweek.com/article.asp?documentKey=1376-LXGOIL0UQVI901-5RJORL8I6BNJBGJ76B844E0GQP |title=Bristol Buys Inhibitex for $2.5 Billion to Compete in Hepatitis |date=January 8, 2012}}</ref>

In 2012, the company donated $ 6.9 million to the [[HealthWell Foundation]], which provides financial assistance to eligible people for covering co-insurance, co-payments, healthcare premiums and deductibles for certain treatments.

On June 29, 2012 Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMS) extend its portfolio of [[diabetes]] treatments when it agreed to buy [[Amylin Pharmaceuticals]] Inc for around $5.3 billion in cash and will pay $1.7 billion to [[Eli Lilly]] to cover Amylin's debt and its obligations to Eli Lilly from ending the collaboration with Amylin. [[Astra Zeneca]], who already collaborates on several diabetes treatments with BMS, will pay $3.4 billion in cash for the rights to develop Amylin's products.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/06/30/uk-amylin-bristolmyerssquibb-idUKBRE85T01U20120630 |title=Bristol-Myers to buy Amylin for about USD 5.3 billion |date=June 30, 2012}}</ref>

==Scandals and allegations==

The company was involved in an [[accounting scandal]] in 2002 that resulted in a significant restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. The restatement was the result of an improper booking of sales related to "[[channel stuffing]]", or the practice of offering excess inventory to customers to create higher sales numbers. The company has since settled with the [[United States Department of Justice]] and [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], agreeing to pay $150 million while neither admitting nor denying guilt.<ref>[http://www.sec.gov/news/digest/dig080904.txt SEC News Digest], August 9, 2004.</ref>

According to an [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] [[consent order]] filed in 2003, the company
{{quote|[...] engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts over the past decade to obstruct the entry of low-price [[generic drug|generic]] competition for three of Bristol's widely used pharmaceutical products: two anti-cancer drugs, Taxol and [[Cisplatin|Platinol]], and the anti-anxiety agent [[BuSpar]].  Bristol avoided competition by abusing federal regulations to block generic entry; deceived the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (PTO) to obtain unwarranted patent protection; paid a would-be generic rival over $70 million not to bring any competing products to market; and filed baseless [[patent infringement]] lawsuits to deter entry by generics.<ref>[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2003/03/bms.htm News Release about Consent Order against Bristol-Myers], March 7, 2003</ref>}}
The company has also been sued in this matter by state attorneys general to recover monetary damages.

As part of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the company was placed under the oversight of a monitor appointed by the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey. In addition, the former head of the Pharma group, [[Richard Lane]], and the ex-CFO, Fred Schiff, were indicted for federal securities violations.

An investigation of the company was made public in July 2006, and the [[FBI]] raided the company's corporate offices. The investigation centered around the distribution of Plavix and charges of [[collusion]].<ref>[http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=565&fArticleId=3367635 Business Report]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}, July 31, 2006. Retrieved September 7, 2006. Archived at [http://web.archive.org/web/20070817193955/http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=565&fArticleId=3367635 Archive.org]</ref>

On September 12, 2006, the monitor, former Federal Judge [[Frederick B. Lacey]], urged the company to remove then CEO Peter Dolan over the Plavix dispute. Later that day, BMS announced that Dolan would indeed step down.<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2006/09/12/news/companies/bristol/index.htm?postversion=2006091217 CNN.com], September 12, 2006. Retrieved September 12, 2006</ref>

The Deferred Prosecution Agreement expired in June 2007 and the Department of Justice did not take any further legal action against the company for matters covered by the DPA. Under CEO Jim Cornelius, who was CEO following Dolan until May 2010, all executives involved in the "channel-stuffing" and generic competition scandals have since left the company.
