'''Aerosolization''' is the process or act of converting some physical substance into the form of particles small and light enough to be carried on the air i.e. into an [[aerosol]].

The term is often used in medicine to refer specifically to the production of airborne particles (e.g. tiny liquid droplets) containing infectious virus or bacteria. The infectious organism is said to be ''aerosolized''. This can occur when an infected individual coughs,<ref name=COUGH>{{Cite doi|10.1056/NEJMicm072576}}</ref> sneezes<ref name=SNEEZE>{{cite journal |url=http://www.sgm.ac.uk/pubs/micro_today/pdf/110503.pdf |title=Microbe-laden aerosols |format=PDF 217&nbsp;KB |journal=Microbiology Today |issue=November 2005}}</ref> exhales,<ref name=JAMPDD>{{cite doi|10.1089/jamp.2008.0720}}</ref> or vomits,<ref name=CDC>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/hcp/clinical-overview.html |title=Norovirus, Clinical Overview |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)}}</ref> but can also arise from flushing a toilet,<ref name=NCBI>{{cite pmid|22137761}}</ref> or disturbing dried contaminated feces.<ref name=Hanta>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/noframes/HPS_WhatYouNeedToKnow.pdf |format=PDF 1.4&nbsp;MB |title=Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS): What You Need To Know |publisher=CDC}}</ref>

Treatment of some respiratory diseases utilize aerosolization of a liquid medication using a [[nebulizer]], which is then breathed in for direct transport to the lungs.

In the context of [[chemical weapons|chemical]] and [[biological weapons]], aerosolization is a means of dispersing a chemical or biological [[biological agent|agent]] in an attack. See for example "[[Botulinum Toxin]] as a Biological Weapon".<ref name=CIDRAP>
