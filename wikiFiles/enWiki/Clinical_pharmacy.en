'''Clinical pharmacy''' is the branch of [[Pharmacy]] where [[pharmacist]]s provide [[patient]] [[health care|care]] that optimizes the use of [[Drug|medication]] and promotes [[health]], [[Wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]], and [[disease]] [[Preventive medicine|prevention]].<ref>[http://www.accp.com/docs/positions/commentaries/Clinpharmdefnfinal.pdf Clinical Pharmacy Defined (Pharmacotherapy 2008;28(6):816–817)]</ref> Clinical pharmacists care for patients in all health care settings but the clinical pharmacy movement initially began inside [[hospital]]s and clinics. Clinical pharmacists often collaborate with [[physician]]s and other [[healthcare professional]]s. 

Clinical pharmacists have extensive [[education]] in the biomedical, [[pharmaceutical]], sociobehavioral and clinical sciences.  Most clinical pharmacists have a [[Doctor of Pharmacy]] (Pharm.D.) [[academic degree|degree]] and many have completed one or more years of [[post-graduate]] training (e.g. a general and/or specialty pharmacy residency). Many clinical pharmacists also choose to become Board Certified through the [http://www.bpsweb.org/index.cfm Board of Pharmacy Specialties] (BPS) which was organized in 1976 as an independent certification agency of APhA (American Pharmacists Association). A pharmacist may become a Board Certified Pharmacotherapy Specialist (BCPS), a Board Certified Oncology Pharmacist (BCOP), Board Certified Nuclear Pharmacist (BCNP), Board Certified Nutrition Support Pharmacist (BCNSP), a Board Certified Psychiatric Pharmacist (BCPP), or a Board Certified Ambulatory Care Pharmacist (BCACP) through the Board of Pharmacy Specialties (BPS). There are also subspecialties within the Pharmacotherapy specialty: Cardiology and Infectious Disease. It is denoted as an "Added Qualification" or AQ. In order to obtain one of these specialties you must first be a Board Certified Pharmacotherapy Specialist (BCPS) and then submit a portfolio to the Board of Pharmacy Specialties for review to determine if they will grant you the added qualifications.<ref>[http://www.bpsweb.org/specialties/specialties.cfm  Board Certification in Pharmacy]</ref>  An up-to-date explanation of pharmacy education leading to the Doctor of Pharmacy degree and Specialty Board Certification can be viewed at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvPb5peBnAY.  

Within the system of [[health care]], clinical pharmacists are [[expert]]s in the therapeutic use of medications. They routinely provide medication [[therapy]] evaluations and [[recommendation]]s to patients and other health care professionals. Clinical pharmacists are a primary source of scientifically valid [[information]] and advice regarding the safe, appropriate, and cost-effective use of medications.<ref>http://www.accp.com/docs/positions/whitePapers/EconEvalClinPharmSvcsFinalkjsedit-gts.pdf</ref> Clinical pharmacists are also making themselves more readily available to the public. In the past, access to a clinical pharmacist was limited to hospitals, clinics, or educational institutions. However, clinical pharmacists are making themselves available through a medication information hotline, and reviewing medication lists, all in an effort to prevent medication errors in the foreseeable future.

In some states, clinical pharmacists are given prescriptive authority under protocol with a medical provider (i.e., MD or DO), and their scope of practice is constantly evolving.<ref>Collaborative drug therapy management (CDTM). Pharmacist's Letter/Prescriber's Letter 2009;25(8):250801.</ref><ref>http://www.amcp.org/amcp.ark?p=AA22E90C</ref><ref>http://www.accp.com/docs/positions/positionStatements/pos2309.pdf</ref>
In the United Kingdom clinical pharmacists are given independent prescriptive authority.
