'''Asteroid hyalosis''' is a degenerative condition of the [[eye]] involving small white [[Opacity (optics)|opacities]] in the [[vitreous humor]].  It is known to occur in humans, [[dog]]s, and [[chinchilla]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wang M, Kador P, Wyman M |title=Structure of asteroid bodies in the vitreous of galactose-fed dogs |journal=Mol Vis |volume=12 |issue= |pages=283–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16617295}}</ref>  Clinically, these opacities are quite refractile, giving the appearance of stars (or asteroids) shining in the night sky—except that ocular asteroids are often quite mobile.  Ocular asteroids must be distinguished from the more common typical vitreous [[floater]]s, which are usually fibrillar or cellular condensates.  The cause of asteroid hyalosis is unknown, but it has been associated with [[diabetes mellitus]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Akram A, Niazi M, Ishaq M, Azad N | title = Frequency of diabetics in asteroid hyalosis patients. | journal = J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 10–1 | year = 2003| pmid = 14727330}}</ref> [[hypertension]], [[hypercholesterolemia]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bergren R, Brown G, Duker J | title = Prevalence and association of asteroid hyalosis with systemic diseases. | journal = Am J Ophthalmol | volume = 111 | issue = 3 | pages = 289–93 | year = 1991 | pmid = 2000898}}</ref> and, in certain animals, tumors of the [[ciliary body]].<ref name=Gelatt_1999>{{cite book|author=Gelatt, Kirk N.
