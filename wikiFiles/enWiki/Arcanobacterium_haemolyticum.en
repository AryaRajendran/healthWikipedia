'''Arcanobacterium haemolyticum''', formerly known as '''Corynebacterium hæmolyticum''', is a [[bacteria]]l species.

==History==

It was first described by MacClean et al. in 1946 from US servicemen and peoples of the South Pacific suffering from [[sore throat]].<ref>MacLean PD, Liebow AA, Rosenberg AA. A hemolytic Corynebacterium resembling Corynebacterium ovis and Corynebacterium pyogenes in man. J Infect Dis. 1946;79:69-90.</ref> 
Due to is resemblance to another type of bacteria, [[Corynebacterium]],  ''A. haemolyticum'' was initially classified as ''C. pyogenes'' subspecies ''hominus''.<ref name="pmid9204295">{{cite journal |author=Linder R |title=Rhodococcus equi and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum: two "coryneform" bacteria increasingly recognized as agents of human infection |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=145–53 |year=1997 |pmid=9204295 |doi= 10.3201/eid0302.970207|url= |pmc=2627624}}</ref>
Controversies regarding classification were resolved in 1982 when a new  genus, ''Arcanobacterium'' (enigmatic bacterium) was created based on its [[peptidoglycan]], fatty acid, and [[DNA]] characteristics.

Since its initial description, the spectrum of diseases caused by ''A. haemolyticum'' has been expanded to include [[sepsis]] and [[osteomyelitis]]. Organisms are [[Gram-positive]],<ref name="urlArcanobacterium Haemolyticum: Overview - eMedicine">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1054547-overview |title=Arcanobacterium Haemolyticum: Overview - eMedicine |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-12-11| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081229113719/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1054547-overview| archivedate= 29 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> facultative [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]], [[catalase]] negative rods (but transition to the [[cocci|coccal]] shape occurs as the organism grows) with arrangements described as matchbox or Chinese letters arrangements. Growth is enhanced in blood and by [[carbon dioxide]].

==Detection==
[[Hemolysis]] is detected on human blood [[agar]] plates, and routine plating of specimens suspected of containing ''A. haemolyticum'' on human blood agar is suggested to distinguish it from ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' as ''A. haemolyticum'' can easily be confused with this organism. The most reliable way to distinguish it from ''S. pyogenes'' is to perform a Gram Stain.

''A. haemolyticum'' infection is most common in 15- to 25-year-old persons and manifests as exudative [[pharyngitis]] and/or [[tonsillitis]] accompanied by cervical [[lymphadenopathy]]. Symptoms look like those of β-hemolytic streptococci or viral infection. A rash of the chest and of the abdomen, neck, or extremities is seen in 20% to 25% of cases enhancing the risk of diagnostic error as streptococcal infection or [[penicillin]] allergy, when β-lactam therapy is initiated without exact diagnosis.<ref name="urlEID V3 N2: Rhodococcus equi and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum: Two Coryneform Bacteria Increasingly Recognized as Agents of Human Infection">{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol3no2/linder.htm |title=EID V3 N2: Rhodococcus equi and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum: Two Coryneform Bacteria Increasingly Recognized as Agents of Human Infection |work= |accessdate=2008-11-04| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080927224712/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol3no2/linder.htm| archivedate= 27 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

''A. haemolyticum'' often occurs in polymicrobic infections together with typical respiratory [[pathogen]]s such as streptococci. The isolation of classical pathogens from specimens that also contain ''A. haemolyticum'' might be in part responsible for the tendency to miss the organism.

==Pathology==

A. haemolyticum is the cause of pharyngitis (sore throat) in up to 2.5% of cases.<ref>Mackenzie A, Fuite LA, Chan FT, King J, Allen U, MacDonald N, Diaz-Mitoma F. Incidence and pathogenicity of Arcanobacterium haemolyticum during a 2-year study in Ottawa. Clin Infect Dis. 1995;21(1):177–81</ref> In one study, it was the causative agent of pharyngitis in 1.4% of military conscripts.<ref>Carlson P, Kontianinen S, Renkonen OV, Sivonen A, Vorpi R Arcanobacterium haemolyticum and streptococcal pharyngitis in army conscripts Scand J Infect Dis. 1995; 27 (1) 17–8</ref> It is rarely found in the skin or throat of healthy people, meaning it is not a member of the usual bacterial flora.<ref name="pmid9204295"/>

Little is known about the means by which ''A. haemolyticum'' causes infection or the associated skin manifestations. The organism is known to produce uncharacterized hemolytic agent(s), a [[neuraminidase]] and a [[phospholipase]] D (PLD) acting preferentially on [[sphingomyelin]]. PLD is known to result in tissue damage, but the role in disease of  the [[cytotoxic]] effect caused by this extracellular toxin is not established. 

[[Pyothorax]] has been reported.<ref name="pmid16144543">{{cite journal |author=Parija SC, Kaliaperumal V, Kumar SV, Sujatha S, Babu V, Balu V |title=Arcanobacterium haemolyticum associated with pyothorax: case report |journal=BMC infectious diseases |volume=5|pages=68 |year=2005 |pmid=16144543 |pmc=1236925 |doi=10.1186/1471-2334-5-68 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/5/68}}</ref>

==Treatment==
''A. hæmolyticum'' isolated from humans is susceptible to [[erythromycin]]<ref name="pmid18445965">{{cite journal |author=Malini A, Deepa EK, Manohar PV, Borappa K, Prasad SR |title=Soft tissue infections with Arcanobacterium haemolyticum: report of three cases |journal=Indian J Med Microbiol |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=192–5 |year=2008 |pmid=18445965 |doi= 10.4103/0255-0857.40543|url=http://www.ijmm.org/article.asp?issn=0255-0857;year=2008;volume=26;issue=2;spage=192;epage=195;aulast=Malini}}</ref> (proposed as the first line drug), [[clindamycin]], [[gentamicin]], and [[cephalosporin]]s. 

The use of parenteral antimicrobial drugs must be limited to serious infections.
