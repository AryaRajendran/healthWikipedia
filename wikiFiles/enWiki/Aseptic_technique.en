'''Aseptic technique''' refers to a procedure that is performed under sterile conditions. This includes medical and laboratory techniques, such as with [[culture]]s. It includes techniques like flame sterilization. The largest example of aseptic techniques is in hospital [[operating theatre]]s.

==Medical procedures==
Aseptic technique is the effort taken to keep patients as free from [[Nosocomial infection|hospital micro-organisms]] as possible (Crow 1989). It is a method used to deter [[wound]]s and other susceptible sites from organisms that could cause infection. This can be achieved by ensuring that only sterile equipment and fluids are used during invasive medical and nursing procedures. Ayliffe et al. (2000) suggest that there are two types of asepsis: medical and surgical asepsis. Medical or clean asepsis reduces the number of organisms and prevents their spread; surgical or sterile asepsis includes procedures to eliminate [[micro-organism]]s from an area and is practiced by [[surgical technologist|surgical technologists]] and nurses in operating theaters and treatment areas. In an operating room, while all members of the surgical team should demonstrate good aseptic technique, it is the role of the [[Perioperative Nursing#Scrub nurse|scrub nurse]] or surgical technologist to set up and maintain the sterile field.
