The '''optic radiation''' (also known as the '''geniculo-calcarine tract''' or as the '''geniculostriate pathway''') is a collection of [[axon]]s from [[relay neuron]]s in the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] of the [[thalamus]] carrying visual information to the [[visual cortex]] (also called ''striate cortex'') along the [[calcarine fissure]]. 

There is one such tract on each side of the [[Human brain|brain]].

==Parts==
A distinctive feature of the optic radiations is that they split into two parts on each side:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Source''' || '''Path''' || '''Information''' || '''Damage'''
 |- 
 | Fibers from the ''inferior [[retina]]'' (also called "Meyer's loop" or "Archambault's loop") || must pass through the [[temporal lobe]] by looping around the [[Lateral ventricles|inferior horn of the lateral ventricle]].  || Carry information from the ''superior part'' of the [[visual field]] || A lesion in the temporal lobe that results in damage to Meyer's loop causes a characteristic loss of [[Visual perception|vision]] in a superior quadrant ([[quadrantanopia]] or "pie in the sky" defect.)
 |- 
 | Fibers from the ''superior retina'' (also called "Baum's loop") || travel straight back through the [[parietal lobe]] to the [[occipital lobe]] in the [[internal capsule|retrolenticular limb of the internal capsule]] to the visual cortex.  || Carry information from the ''inferior part'' of the visual field || Taking the shorter path, these fibers are less susceptible to damage.
