'''Obesity hypoventilation syndrome''' (also known as '''Pickwickian syndrome''') is a condition in which severely overweight people [[hypoventilation|fail to breathe rapidly enough or deeply enough]], resulting in low blood [[oxygen]] levels and high blood [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels.  Many people with this condition also frequently stop breathing altogether for short periods of time during sleep ([[obstructive sleep apnea]]), resulting in many partial awakenings during the night, which leads to continual sleepiness during the day.<ref name=Olson2005>{{cite journal |author=Olson AL, Zwillich C |title=The obesity hypoventilation syndrome |journal=Am.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is defined as the combination of [[obesity]] ([[body mass index]] above 30&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (falling [[oxygen]] levels in blood) during sleep, and [[hypercapnia]] (increased blood [[carbon dioxide]] levels) during the day, resulting from [[hypoventilation]] (excessively slow or shallow breathing).<ref name=Mokhlesi/><ref name=Sleep1999>{{cite journal |author=Anonymous |title=Sleep-related breathing disorders in adults: recommendations for syndrome definition and measurement techniques in clinical research. The Report of an American Academy of Sleep Medicine Task Force |journal=Sleep |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=667–89 |year=1999 |pmid=10450601}}</ref> The disease has been known since the 1950s, initially as "Pickwickian syndrome" in reference to a [[Charles Dickens|Dickensian]] character but currently under a more descriptive name.<ref name=Mokhlesi/>

== Classification ==
Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is a form of [[sleep disordered breathing]]. Two subtypes are recognized, depending on the nature of disordered breathing detected on further investigations. The first is OHS in the context of obstructive sleep apnea; this is confirmed by the occurrence of 5 or more episodes of apnea, hypopnea or respiratory-related arousals per hour (high [[apnea-hypopnea index]]) during sleep. The second is OHS primarily due to "sleep hypoventilation syndrome"; this requires a rise of CO<sub>2</sub> levels by 10 mmHg (1.3 kPa) after sleep compared to awake measurements and overnight drops in oxygen levels without simultaneous apnea or hypopnea.<ref name=Olson2005/><ref name=Sleep1999/> Overall, 90% of all people with OHS fall into the first category, and 10% in the second.<ref name=Mokhlesi/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Most people with obesity hypoventilation syndrome have concurrent [[sleep apnea|obstructive sleep apnea]], a condition characterized by [[snoring]], brief episodes of [[apnea]] (cessation of breathing) during the night, interrupted sleep and [[excessive daytime sleepiness]]. In OHS, sleepiness may be worsened by elevated blood levels of [[carbon dioxide]], which causes drowsiness ("CO<sub>2</sub> narcosis"). Other symptoms present in both conditions are [[clinical depression|depression]], and [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure) that is difficult to [[antihypertensive|control with medication]].<ref name=Olson2005/> The high carbon dioxide can also cause [[headache]]s, which tend to be worse in the morning.<ref name="McNicholas">{{cite book | last=McNicholas | first=WT | coauthors=Phillipson EA | title=Breathing Disorders in Sleep | publisher=Saunders Ltd. | year=2001 | pages=80 | isbn=0-7020-2510-0}}</ref>

The low oxygen level leads to excessive strain on the right side of the heart, known as ''[[cor pulmonale]]''.<ref name=Olson2005/> Symptoms of this disorder occur because the heart has difficulty pumping blood from the body through the lungs. Fluid may therefore accumulate in the skin of the legs in the form of [[edema]] (swelling), and in the abdominal cavity in the form of [[ascites]]; decreased exercise tolerance and exertional [[chest pain]] may occur. On [[physical examination]], characteristic findings are the presence of a raised [[jugular venous pressure]], a palpable parasternal heave, a [[heart murmur]] due to [[tricuspid insufficiency|blood leaking through the tricuspid valve]], [[hepatomegaly]] (an enlarged liver), ascites and leg edema.<ref>{{cite book |author=Braunwald E |editor=Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, ''et al.'' |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|edition=16th |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-07-139140-1 |pages=1367–78 |chapter=Chapter 216: heart failure and cor pulmonale}}</ref> Cor pulmonale occurs in about a third of all people with OHS.<ref name=Mokhlesi/>

==Mechanism==
It is not fully understood why some obese people develop obesity hypoventilation syndrome while others do not. It is likely that it is the result of an interplay of various processes. Firstly, work of breathing is increased as [[adipose tissue]] restricts the normal movement of the chest muscles and makes the chest wall less [[Compliance (physiology)|compliant]], the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] moves less effectively, respiratory muscles are fatigued more easily, and airflow in and out of the lung is impaired by excessive tissue in the head and neck area. Hence, people with obesity need to expend more energy to breathe effectively.<ref name="Bray">{{cite book | last=Bray | first=GA | coauthors=Bouchard C, James WPT | title=Handbook of Obesity | publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc. | year=1998 | pages=726 | isbn=0-8247-9899-6 }}</ref><ref name="Bjorntorp">{{cite book | last=Björntorp | first=P | coauthors=Brodoff BN | title=Obesity | publisher=JB Lippincott | year=1992 | pages=569 | isbn=0-397-50999-5 }}</ref> These factors together lead to sleep-disordered breathing and inadequate removal of carbon dioxide from the circulation and hence hypercapnia; given that carbon dioxide in aqueous solution combines with water to form an acid (CO<sub>2</sub>[g] + H<sub>2</sub>O[l] + excess H<sub>2</sub>O[l] --> H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>[aq]), this causes [[acidosis]] (increased acidity of the blood). Under normal circumstances, [[central chemoreceptors]] in the [[brain stem]] detect the acidity, and respond by increasing the [[respiratory rate]]; in OHS, this "ventilatory response" is blunted.<ref name=Mokhlesi/><ref name=Piper>{{cite journal |author=Piper AJ, Grunstein RR |title=Current perspectives on the obesity hypoventilation syndrome |journal=Curr. Opin. Pulm. Med. |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=490–6 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17901754 |doi=10.1097/MCP.0b013e3282ef6894}}</ref>

The blunted ventilatory response is attributed to several factors. Obese people tend to have raised levels of the hormone [[leptin]], which is secreted by adipose tissue and under normal circumstances increases ventilation. In OHS, this effect is reduced.<ref name=Mokhlesi/><ref name=Piper/> Furthermore, episodes of nighttime acidosis (e.g. due to sleep apnea) lead to [[renal compensation|compensation by the kidneys]] with retention of the [[alkali]] [[bicarbonate]]. This normalizes the acidity of the blood. However, bicarbonate stays around in the bloodstream for longer, and further episodes of hypercapnia lead to relatively mild acidosis and reduced ventilatory response in a [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]].<ref name=Mokhlesi/><ref name=Piper/>

Low oxygen levels lead to [[hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction]], the tightening of small blood vessels in the lung to create an optimal distribution of blood through the lung. Persistently low oxygen levels causing chronic vasoconstriction leads to increased pressure on the [[pulmonary artery]] ([[pulmonary hypertension]]), which in turn puts strain on the [[right ventricle]], the part of the heart that pumps blood to the lungs. The right ventricle undergoes [[Ventricular remodeling|remodeling]], becomes distended and is less able to remove blood from the veins. When this is the case, raised [[hydrostatic pressure]] leads to accumulation of fluid in the skin (edema), and in more severe cases the liver and the abdominal cavity.<ref name=Mokhlesi/>

The chronically low oxygen levels in the blood also lead to increased release of [[erythropoietin]] and the activation of [[erythropoeisis]], the production of [[red blood cell]]s. This results in [[polycythemia]], abnormally increased numbers of circulating red blood cells and an elevated [[hematocrit]].<ref name=Mokhlesi/>

==Diagnosis==
Formal criteria for diagnosis of OHS are:<ref name=Olson2005/><ref name=Mokhlesi/><ref name=Sleep1999/>
* [[Body mass index]] over 30&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (a measure of obesity, obtained by taking one's weight in kilograms and dividing it by one's height in meters squared)
* Arterial carbon dioxide level over 45&nbsp;[[Torr|mmHg]] or 6.0&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]] as determined by [[arterial blood gas]] measurement
* No alternative explanation for hypoventilation, such as use of [[narcotic]]s, severe [[obstructive lung disease|obstructive]] or [[interstitial lung disease]], severe chest wall disorders such as [[kyphoscoliosis]], severe [[hypothyroidism]] (underactive thyroid), [[neuromuscular disease]] or [[congenital central hypoventilation syndrome]]

If OHS is suspected, various tests are required for its confirmation. The most important initial test is the demonstration of elevated carbon dioxide in the blood. This requires an [[arterial blood gas]] determination, which involves taking a blood sample from an [[artery]], usually the [[radial artery]]. Given that it would be complicated to perform this test on every patient with sleep-related breathing problems, some suggest that measuring bicarbonate levels in normal (venous) blood would be a reasonable screening test. If this is elevated (27&nbsp;mmol/l or higher), further investigations for OHS may be needed.<ref name=Mokhlesi/>

To distinguish various subtypes, [[polysomnography]] is required. This usually requires brief admission to a hospital with a specialized sleep medicine department where a number of different measurements are conducted while the subject is asleep; this includes [[electroencephalography]] (electronic registration of electrical activity in the brain), [[electrocardiography]] (same for electrical activity in the heart), [[pulse oximeter|pulse oximetry]] (measurement of oxygen levels) and often other modalities.<ref name=Olson2005/> Blood tests are also recommended for the identification of [[hypothyroidism]] and [[polycythemia]].<ref name=Olson2005/><ref name=Mokhlesi/>

To distinguish between OHS and various other lung diseases that can cause similar symptoms, [[medical imaging]] of the lungs (such as a [[chest X-ray]] or [[Computed tomography|CT/CAT scan]]), [[spirometry]], electrocardiography and [[echocardiography]] may be performed. Echo- and electrocardiography may also show strain on the right side of the heart caused by OHS, and spirometry may show a [[restrictive lung disease|restrictive]] pattern related to obesity.<ref name=Mokhlesi/>

==Treatment==
In people with stable OHS, the most important treatment is [[Weight loss#Intentional weight loss|weight loss]]—by diet, through [[physical exercise|exercise]], with medication, or sometimes [[bariatric surgery|weight loss surgery]] (bariatric surgery). This has been shown to improve the symptoms of OHS and resolution of the high carbon dioxide levels. Weight loss may take a long time and is not always successful.<ref name=Olson2005/> Bariatric surgery is avoided if possible, given the high rate of complications, but may be considered if other treatment modalities are ineffective in improving oxygen levels and symptoms.<ref name=Mokhlesi/> If the symptoms are significant, nighttime [[positive airway pressure]] (PAP) treatment is tried; this involves the use of a machine to assist with breathing. PAP exists in various forms, and the ideal strategy is uncertain. Some medications have been tried to stimulate breathing or correct underlying abnormalities; their benefit is again uncertain.<ref name=Mokhlesi/>

While many people with obesity hypoventilation syndrome are cared for on an outpatient basis, some deteriorate suddenly and when admitted to hospital may show severe abnormalities such as markedly deranged blood acidity (pH<7.25) or depressed [[level of consciousness]] due to very high carbon dioxide levels. On occasions, admission to an [[intensive care unit]] with [[intubation]] and [[mechanical ventilation]] is necessary. Otherwise, "bi-level" positive airway pressure (see the next section) is commonly used to stabilize the patient, followed by conventional treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mokhlesi B, Kryger MH, Grunstein RR |title=Assessment and management of patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome |journal=Proc Am Thorac Soc |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=218–25 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18250215 |doi=10.1513/pats.200708-122MG |url=http://pats.atsjournals.org/cgi/content/full/5/2/218 |pmc=2645254}}</ref>

===Positive airway pressure===
[[Positive airway pressure]], initially in the form of ''continuous'' positive airway pressure (CPAP), is a useful treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, particularly when obstructive sleep apnea co-exists. CPAP requires the nighttime use of a machine that delivers a continuous positive pressure to the airways and preventing the collapse of soft tissues in the throat during breathing; it is administered through a mask on either the mouth and nose together, or if that is not tolerated on the nose only (nasal CPAP). This relieves the features of obstructive sleep apnea, and is often sufficient to remove the resultant accumulation of carbon dioxide. The pressure is increased until the obstructive symptoms (snoring and periods of apnea) have disappeared. CPAP alone is effective in more than 50% of people with OHS.<ref name=Mokhlesi/>

In some occasions, the oxygen levels are persistently too low ([[Oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve|oxygen saturations]] below 90%). In that case, the hypoventilation itself may be improved by switching from CPAP treatment to an alternate device that delivers "bi-level" positive pressure: higher pressure during inspiration (breathing in) and a lower pressure during expiration (breathing out). If this too is ineffective in increasing oxygen levels, addition of [[oxygen therapy]] may be necessary. As a last resort, [[tracheostomy]] may be necessary; this involves making a surgical opening in the trachea to bypass obesity-related airway obstruction in the neck. This may be combined with mechanical ventilation with an assisted breathing device through the opening.<ref name=Mokhlesi/>

===Other treatments===
[[Medroxyprogesterone]], a form of the hormone [[progesterone]], has been shown to improve the ventilatory response, but this has been poorly studied and is associated with an increased risk of [[thrombosis]].<ref name=Olson2005/><ref name=Mokhlesi/> Similarly, the drug [[acetazolamide]] can reduce bicarbonate levels, and thereby augment to normal ventilatory response, but this has been researched insufficiently to recommend wide application.<ref name=Mokhlesi/>

==Prognosis==
Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is associated with a reduced [[quality of life]], and people with the condition incur increased healthcare costs, largely due to hospital admissions including observation and treatment on [[intensive care unit]]s. OHS often occurs together with several other disabling medical conditions, such as [[asthma]] (in 18–24%) and [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] (in 30–32%). Its main complication of heart failure affects 21–32% of patients.<ref name=Mokhlesi/>

Those with abnormalities severe enough to warrant treatment have an increased risk of death, reported to be 23% over 18 months and 46% over 50 months. This risk is reduced to less than 10% in those receiving treatment with PAP. Treatment also reduces the need for hospital admissions and reduces healthcare costs.<ref name=Mokhlesi/>

==Epidemiology==
The exact prevalence of obesity hypoventilation syndrome is unknown, and it is thought that many people with symptoms of OHS have not been diagnosed.<ref name=Olson2005/> About a third of all people with morbid obesity (a [[body mass index]] exceeding 40&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) have elevated [[carbon dioxide]] levels in the blood.<ref name=Mokhlesi/>

When examining groups of people with obstructive sleep apnea, researchers have found that 10–20% of them meet the criteria for OHS as well. The risk of OHS is much higher is those with more severe obesity, i.e. a body mass index (BMI) of 40&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup> or higher. It is twice as common in men compared to women. The average age at diagnosis is 52. American [[Black people]] are more likely to be obese than American whites, and are therefore more likely to develop OHS, but obese Asians are more likely than people of other ethnicities to have OHS at a lower BMI as a result of physical characteristics.<ref name=Mokhlesi/>

It is anticipated that rates of OHS will rise as the prevalence of obesity rises. This may also explain why OHS is more commonly reported in the [[United States]], where obesity is more common, than in other countries.<ref name=Mokhlesi/>

==History==
The discovery of obesity hypoventilation syndrome is generally attributed to the authors of a 1956 report of a professional [[poker]] player who, after gaining weight, became somnolent and fatigued and prone to fall asleep during the day, as well as developing [[edema]] of the legs suggesting [[heart failure]]. The authors coined the condition "Pickwickian syndrome" after the character Joe from [[Charles Dickens|Dickens']] ''[[The Pickwick Papers|The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club]]'' (1837), who was markedly obese and tended to fall asleep uncontrollably during the day.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Burwell CS, Robin ED, Whaley RD, Bicklemann AG |title=Extreme obesity associated with alveolar hypoventilation; a Pickwickian syndrome |journal=Am.
