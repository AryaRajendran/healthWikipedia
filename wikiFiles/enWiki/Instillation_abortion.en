'''Instillation abortion''' is a rarely used method of [[abortion|induced abortion]], performed in the second trimester, by injecting a solution into the uterus to cause uterine contractions.

==Procedure==
Instillation abortion is performed by injecting a [[chemistry|chemical]] [[solution]] consisting of either [[Saline (medicine)|saline]], [[urea]], or [[prostaglandin]] through the [[abdomen]] and into the [[amniotic sac]]. The [[cervix]] is [[Cervical dilation|dilated]] prior to the injection, and the chemical solution induces [[uterine contraction]]s which expel the [[fetus]]. <ref>James, Denise. (2006). [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/266440-treatment Therapeutic Abortion]. Retrieved February 24, 2009.</ref> Sometimes a [[dilation and curettage]] procedure is necessary to remove any remaining tissue. <ref name="UIHC" />

Instillation methods can require [[Inpatient care|hospitalization]] for 12 to 48 hours. <ref name="UIHC" /> In one study, when [[laminaria]] were used to dilate the cervix overnight, the time between injection and completion was reduced from 29 to 14 hours. <ref>Stubblefield, Phillip G., Carr-Ellis, Sacheen, & Borgatta, Lynn.

==Usage==
The method of instillation abortion was first developed in 1934 by [[Eugen Aburel]]. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Potts DM |title=Termination of pregnancy |journal=Br. Med.

In a 1998 [[Guttmacher Institute]] [[statistical survey|survey]], sent to hospitals in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], 9% of those  [[hospital]]s in the province which offered abortion services used saline instillations, 4% used urea, and 25% used prostaglandin. <ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2991628 |author=Ferris LE, McMain-Klein M, Iron K |title=Factors influencing the delivery of abortion services in Ontario: a descriptive study |journal=Fam Plann Perspect |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=134–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9635262 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3013498.html |jstor=2991628}}</ref> A 1998 study of facilities in [[Nigeria]] which provide abortion found that only 5% of the total number in the country use saline. <ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2991973 |author=Henshaw, Stanley K., Singh, Susheela, Oye-Adeniran, Boniface A., Adewole, Isaac F., Iwere,  Ngozi, & Cuca, Yvette P. |title=The Incidence of Induced Abortion in Nigeria |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=156–64 |year=1998 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2415698.html |jstor=2991973}}</ref>

==Complications==
Once in common practice, abortion by intrauterine instillation has fallen out of favor, due to its association with serious [[adverse effect]]s and its replacement by procedures which require less time and result in less physical discomfort. <ref>Trupin, Suzanne R. (2006). [http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic5.htm Abortion]. Retrieved August 14, 2006.</ref> 

Saline is in general safer and more effective than the other intrauterine solutions because it is likely to work in one dose. However, it poses a risk of [[medical emergency]] if it enters the [[blood|blood stream]]. Prostaglandin is fast-acting, but often requires a second injection, and carries more side effects, such as [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[diarrhea]]. <ref name="UIHC" />

Instillation of either saline or prostaglandin is associated with a higher risk of immediate complications than surgical [[dilatation and curettage|D&C]]. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Ferris LE, McMain-Klein M, Colodny N, Fellows GF, Lamont J |title=Factors associated with immediate abortion complications |journal=CMAJ |volume=154 |issue=11 |pages=1677–85 |year=1996 |month=June |pmid=8646655 |pmc=1487918 }}</ref> [[Dilation and evacuation]] is also reported to be safer than instillation methods. <ref name="grimes">{{cite journal |author=Grimes DA, Schulz KF |title=Morbidity and mortality from second-trimester abortions |journal=J Reprod Med |volume=30 |issue=7 |pages=505–14 |year=1985 |month=July |pmid=3897528 }}</ref> One study found that the risk of complications associated with the injection of a combination of urea and [[prostaglandin]] into the [[amniotic fluid]] was 1.9 times that of D&E. <ref name="grimes" /> 

The rate of [[death|mortality]] reported in the [[United States]] between 1972 to 1981 was 9.6 per 100,000 for instillation methods. This is in comparison to rates of 4.9 per 100,000 for D&E and 60 per 100,000 for abortion by [[hysterotomy abortion|hysterotomy]] and [[hysterectomy]]. <ref name="grimes" />

There have been at least two documented cases of unsuccessful instillation abortions that resulted in  live births.<ref>Elliott, Jane. "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4500022.stm 'I survived an abortion attempt']." (December 6, 2005.) ''BBC News.'' Retrieved April 26, 2007.<br />
