'''Diabetes mellitus type&nbsp;2''' (formerly '''noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)''' or '''adult-onset diabetes''') is a [[metabolic disorder]] that is characterized by high [[blood glucose]] in the context of [[insulin resistance]] and relative [[insulin]] deficiency.<ref name="Pathologic Basis of Disease"/> This is in contrast to [[diabetes mellitus type&nbsp;1]], in which there is an absolute insulin deficiency due to destruction of [[Islets of Langerhans|islet cells]] in the [[pancreas]].<ref name=Green2011>{{cite book|last=Shoback|first=edited by David G. Gardner, Dolores|title=Greenspan's basic & clinical endocrinology|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=0-07-162243-8|pages=Chapter 17|edition=9th}}</ref> The classic symptoms are [[polydipsia|excess thirst]], [[polyuria|frequent urination]], and [[polyphagia|constant hunger]]. Type&nbsp;2 diabetes makes up about 90% of cases of [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] with the other 10% due primarily to [[diabetes mellitus type 1]] and [[gestational diabetes]]. [[Obesity]] is thought to be the primary cause of type&nbsp;2 diabetes in people who are genetically predisposed to the disease.

<!-- Treatment -->
Type&nbsp;2 diabetes is initially managed by increasing [[physical exercise|exercise]] and [[diabetic diet|dietary modification]]. If blood glucose levels are not adequately lowered by these measures, medications such as [[metformin]] or [[insulin]] may be needed. In those on insulin, there is typically the requirement to routinely check [[blood sugar]] levels.

<!--Prognosis and Epidemiology  -->
Rates of type&nbsp;2 diabetes have increased markedly over the last 50 years in parallel with obesity: As of 2010 there are approximately 285&nbsp;million people with the disease compared to around 30&nbsp;million in 1985.<ref name=Will2011/><ref name=Epi2006/> Long-term complications from high blood sugar can include [[heart disease]], [[strokes]], [[diabetic retinopathy]] where eyesight is affected, [[kidney failure]] which may require [[dialysis]], and poor circulation of limbs leading to [[amputation]]s. The acute complication of [[Diabetic ketoacidosis|ketoacidosis]], a feature of [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type&nbsp;1 diabetes]], is uncommon.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fasanmade|first=OA|coauthors=Odeniyi, IA, Ogbera, AO|title=Diabetic ketoacidosis: diagnosis and management|journal=African journal of medicine and medical sciences|date=2008 Jun|volume=37|issue=2|pages=99–105|pmid=18939392}}</ref> However, [[nonketotic hyperosmolar coma]] may occur.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Main symptoms of diabetes.png|thumb|300px|Overview of the most significant symptoms of diabetes.]]
The classic symptoms of diabetes are [[polyuria]] (frequent urination), [[polydipsia]] (increased thirst), [[polyphagia]] (increased hunger), and [[weight loss]].<ref name=Vij2010>{{cite journal|last=Vijan|first=S|title=Type 2 diabetes|journal=Annals of internal medicine|date=2010-03-02|volume=152|issue=5|pages=ITC31–15; quiz ITC316|pmid=20194231|doi=10.1059/0003-4819-152-5-201003020-01003}}</ref> Other symptoms that are commonly present at diagnosis include: a history of [[blurred vision]], [[pruritus|itchiness]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], recurrent [[vulvovaginitis|vaginal infections]], and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].<!-- <ref name=Green2011/> --> Many people, however, have no symptoms during the first few years and are diagnosed on routine testing.<!-- <ref name=Green2011/> --> People with type&nbsp;2 diabetes mellitus may rarely present with [[nonketotic hyperosmolar coma]] (a condition of very high blood sugar associated with a [[decreased level of consciousness]] and [[hypotension|low blood pressure]]).<ref name=Green2011/>

===Complications===
{{Main|Complications of diabetes mellitus}}
Type&nbsp;2&nbsp;diabetes is typically a chronic disease associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy.<ref name=Will2011/> This is partly due to a number of complications with which it is associated, including: two to four times the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]], including [[ischemic heart disease]] and [[stroke]]; a 20-fold increase in lower limb [[amputations]], and increased rates of hospitalizations.<ref name=Will2011/> In the developed world, and increasingly elsewhere, type&nbsp;2&nbsp;diabetes is the largest cause of nontraumatic [[blindness]] and [[Chronic kidney disease|kidney failure]].<ref name=AFP09/> It has also been associated with an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction and [[dementia]] through disease processes such as [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Multi-infarct dementia|vascular dementia]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pasquier|first=F|title=Diabetes and cognitive impairment: how to evaluate the cognitive status?|journal=Diabetes & metabolism|date=2010 Oct|volume=36 Suppl 3|pages=S100–5|pmid=21211730|doi=10.1016/S1262-3636(10)70475-4}}</ref> Other complications include: [[acanthosis nigricans]], [[impotence|sexual dysfunction]], and frequent infections.<ref name=Vij2010/>

The development of type&nbsp;2 diabetes is caused by a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors.<ref name=AFP09/><ref name=Fat2009>{{cite journal |author=Risérus U, [[Walter Willett|Willett WC]], Hu FB |title=Dietary fats and prevention of type 2 diabetes |journal=Progress in Lipid Research |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=44–51 |year=2009 |month=January|pmid=19032965 |doi=10.1016/j.plipres.2008.10.002 |pmc=2654180}}</ref> While some are under personal control, such as diet and [[obesity]], others, such as increasing age, female gender, and genetics, are not.<ref name=Will2011/> A lack of sleep has been linked to type&nbsp;2 diabetes.<ref name=Sleep2011>{{cite journal|last=Touma|first=C|coauthors=Pannain, S|title=Does lack of sleep cause diabetes?|journal=Cleveland Clinic journal of medicine|date=2011 Aug|volume=78|issue=8|pages=549–58|pmid=21807927|doi=10.3949/ccjm.78a.10165}}</ref> This is believed to act through its effect on metabolism.<ref name=Sleep2011/> The nutritional status of a mother during fetal development may also play a role, with one proposed mechanism being that of altered [[DNA methylation]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Christian|first=P|coauthors=Stewart, CP|title=Maternal micronutrient deficiency, fetal development, and the risk of chronic disease|journal=The Journal of nutrition|date=2010 Mar|volume=140|issue=3|pages=437–45|pmid=20071652|doi=10.3945/jn.109.116327}}</ref>

===Lifestyle===
{{Main|Lifestyle causes of diabetes mellitus type 2}}
A number of lifestyle factors are known to be important to the development of type&nbsp;2 diabetes, including: [[obesity]] (defined by a [[body mass index]] of greater than thirty), lack of physical activity, poor diet, stress, and [[urbanization]].<ref name=Will2011/> Excess body fat is associated with 30% of cases in those of Chinese and Japanese descent, 60-80% of cases in those of European and African descent, and 100% of Pima Indians and Pacific Islanders.<ref name=Green2011/> Those who are not obese often have a high [[waist–hip ratio]].<ref name=Green2011/>

Dietary factors also influence the risk of developing type&nbsp;2 diabetes.

==Pathophysiology==
Type&nbsp;2 diabetes is due to insufficient insulin production from [[beta cells]] in the setting of [[insulin resistance]].<ref name=Green2011/> Insulin resistance, which is the inability of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s to respond adequately to normal levels of insulin, occurs primarily within the muscles, liver, and fat tissue.<ref>{{cite book|title=Diabetes mellitus a guide to patient care.|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-58255-732-8|page=15|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=fiAclxvKblkC&pg=PA15}}</ref> In the liver, insulin normally suppresses glucose release. However, in the setting of insulin resistance, the liver inappropriately releases glucose into the blood.<ref name=Will2011/> The proportion of insulin resistance versus beta cell dysfunction differs among individuals, with some having primarily insulin resistance and only a minor defect in insulin secretion and others with slight insulin resistance and primarily a lack of insulin secretion.<ref name=Green2011/>

Other potentially important mechanisms associated with type&nbsp;2 diabetes and insulin resistance include: increased breakdown of [[lipids]] within [[fat cell]]s, resistance to and lack of [[incretin]], high [[glucagon]] levels in the blood, increased retention of salt and water by the kidneys, and inappropriate regulation of metabolism by the [[central nervous system]].<ref name=Will2011/> However, not all people with insulin resistance develop diabetes, since an impairment of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells is also required.<ref name=Green2011/>

There are several classes of [[anti-diabetic medications]] available.
