'''Keratoconus''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''kerato-'' horn, cornea; and ''konos'' cone) is a [[Degenerative disease|degenerative]] disorder of the [[Human eye|eye]] in which structural changes within the [[cornea]] cause it to thin and change to a more [[Cone (geometry)|conical]] shape than its normal gradual [[curve]].

Keratoconus can cause substantial distortion of [[Visual perception|vision]], with multiple images, streaking and [[photophobia|sensitivity to light]] all often reported by the patient. It is typically diagnosed in the patient's [[Adolescence|adolescent]] years. If afflicting both eyes, the deterioration in vision can affect the patient's ability to drive a car or read normal print.

In most cases, [[corrective lens]]es fitted by a specialist are effective enough to allow the patient to continue to drive legally and likewise function normally. Further progression of the disease may require [[surgery]], for which several options are available, including intrastromal corneal ring segments, cross-linking, mini asymmetric radial keratotomy and, in 25% of cases, [[corneal transplantation]].

Estimates of the prevalence for keratoconus range from 1 in 500 to 1 in 2000 people,<ref>{{cite web|last=Weissman|first=Barry|title=Keratoconus|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1194693-overview#showall|work=WebMD, LLC|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=24 December 2012}}</ref> but difficulties with [[differential diagnosis]] cause uncertainty as to its prevalence.  It seems to occur in populations throughout the world, although it is observed more frequently in certain ethnic groups, such as South Asians. Environmental and genetic factors are considered possible causes, but the exact cause is uncertain. It has been associated with detrimental [[enzyme]] activity within the cornea, and is more common in patients with [[Down syndrome]].

People with early keratoconus typically notice a minor blurring of their vision and come to their clinician seeking corrective lenses for reading or driving.<ref name="feder">{{cite book | first = | last =Feder R, Kshettry P| authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2005| month = | title = Cornea| chapter = Non-inflammatory Ectactic Disorders, Chapter 78 | editor = Krachmer J | others = | edition = | pages = | publisher = Mosby | location = | isbn = 0-323-02315-0| url = }}</ref><ref name="epstein">{{cite web | author=Epstein A| year=2000| title=Keratoconus and related disorders| format=PDF | work=North Shore Contact Lens | url=http://www.northshorecontactlens.com/KeratoconusText.pdf | accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref> At early stages, the [[symptom]]s of keratoconus may be no different from those of any other [[Refractive error|refractive defect]] of the eye. As the disease progresses, vision deteriorates, sometimes rapidly. [[Visual acuity]] becomes impaired at all distances, and [[night vision]] is often poor. Some individuals have vision in one eye that is markedly worse than that in the other. The disease is often bilateral, though asymmetrical. Some develop [[photophobia]] (sensitivity to bright light), [[eye strain]] from squinting in order to read, or [[itch]]ing in the eye,<ref name="feder"/> but there is normally little or no sensation of [[pain]]. It may, in certain cases cause luminous objects appear like cylindrical pipes with the same luminous intensity at all points.

The classic symptom of keratoconus is the perception of multiple "ghost" images, known as [[monocular polyopia]]. This effect is most clearly seen with a high [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] field, such as a point of light on a dark background. Instead of seeing just one point, a person with keratoconus sees many images of the point, spread out in a chaotic pattern. This pattern does not typically change from day to day, but over time, it often takes on new forms. Patients also commonly notice streaking and [[Lens flare|flaring]] distortion around light sources. Some even notice the images moving relative to one another in time with their heart beat. 
The predominant [[optical aberration]] of the eye in keratoconus is the so-called [[coma (optics)|coma]].<ref name="pmid17553566">{{cite journal |author=Pantanelli S, MacRae S, Jeong TM, Yoon G |title=Characterizing the wave aberration in eyes with keratoconus or penetrating keratoplasty using a high-dynamic range wavefront sensor |journal=Ophthalmology |volume=114 |issue=11 |pages=2013–21 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17553566 |doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2007.01.008}}</ref><ref name="pmid19029032">{{cite journal |author=Nakagawa T |title=Higher-order aberrations due to the posterior corneal surface in patients with keratoconus |journal=Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science |volume=50 |issue=6 |pages=2660–5 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19029032 |doi=10.1167/iovs.08-2754 |author-separator=, |author2=Maeda N |author3=Kosaki R |display-authors=3 |last4=Hori |first4=Y. |last5=Inoue |first5=T. |last6=Saika |first6=M. |last7=Mihashi |first7=T. |last8=Fujikado |first8=T. |last9=Tano |first9=Y.}}</ref> The visual distortion experienced by the patient comes from two sources, one being the irregular deformation of the surface of the cornea, and the other being scarring that occurs on its exposed highpoints. These factors act to form regions on the cornea that map an image to different locations on the [[retina]]. The effect can worsen in low light conditions, as the dark-adapted [[pupil]] dilates to expose more of the irregular surface of the cornea.

== Diagnosis ==
[[Image:Keratoconus.svg|thumb|right|A schematic digram showing change in [[cornea]]]]
Prior to any [[physical examination]], the [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of keratoconus frequently begins with an [[ophthalmologist]]'s or [[optometrist]]'s assessment of the patient's [[medical history]], particularly the [[chief complaint]] and other visual symptoms, the presence of any history of ocular disease or injury which might affect vision, and the presence of any family history of ocular disease. An [[eye chart]], such as a standard [[Snellen chart]] of [[optotype|progressively smaller letters]], is then used to determine the patient's [[visual acuity]]. The [[eye examination]] may proceed to measurement of the localized curvature of the cornea with a manual [[keratometer]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nordan LT |title=Keratoconus: diagnosis and treatment |journal=International Ophthalmology Clinics |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=51–63 |year=1997 |pmid=9101345 |doi=10.1097/00004397-199703710-00005}}</ref> with detection of irregular [[Astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]] suggesting a possibility of keratoconus. Severe cases can exceed the instrument's measuring ability.<ref name="epstein"/> A further indication can be provided by [[retinoscopy]], in which a light beam is focused on the patient's [[retina]] and the reflection, or reflex, observed as the examiner tilts the light source back and forth. Keratoconus is amongst the ophthalmic conditions that exhibit a scissor reflex action of two bands moving toward and away from each other like the blades of a pair of [[scissors]].<ref name="epstein"/><ref>{{cite book | first = | last =Zadnik K | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1997| month = | title =  The ocular examination : measurements and findings | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | pages = | publisher = W.B. Saunders| location = Philadelphia | isbn = 0-7216-5209-3| url = }}</ref>

If keratoconus is suspected, the ophthalmologist or optometrist will search for other characteristic findings of the disease by means of [[slit lamp]] examination of the cornea.<ref name="rabonitz">{{cite book | first = | last =Rabonitz Y | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2004 | month = | title = The Cornea| chapter = Ectatic Disorders of the Cornea | edition =4th| editor = Foster C ''et al.'' | others = | pages = 889–911| publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins| location = Philadelphia| isbn = 0-7817-4206-4 | url = }}</ref> An advanced case is usually readily apparent to the examiner, and can provide for an unambiguous diagnosis prior to more specialized testing. Under close examination, a ring of yellow-brown to olive-green pigmentation known as a [[Fleischer ring]] can be observed in around half of keratoconic eyes.<ref name="Edrington">{{cite journal |author=Edrington TB, Zadnik K, Barr JT |title=Keratoconus |journal=Optometry Clinics |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=65–73 |year=1995 |pmid=7767020}}</ref> The Fleischer ring, caused by deposition of the iron oxide [[hemosiderin]] within the corneal epithelium, is subtle and may not be readily detectable in all cases, but becomes more evident when viewed under a [[cobalt blue]] filter.<ref name="epstein"/> Similarly, around 50% of subjects exhibit Vogt's [[striae]], fine stress lines within the cornea caused by stretching and thinning.<ref name="Edrington"/> The striae temporarily disappear while slight pressure is applied to the eyeball.<ref name="epstein"/> A highly pronounced cone can create a V-shaped indentation in the lower [[eyelid]] when the patient's gaze is directed downwards, known as [[Munson's sign]].<ref name="feder"/> Other [[clinical sign]]s of keratoconus will normally have presented themselves long before Munson's sign becomes apparent,<ref name="Krachmer">{{cite journal |author=Krachmer JH, Feder RS, Belin MW |title=Keratoconus and related noninflammatory corneal thinning disorders |journal=Survey of Ophthalmology |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=293–322 |year=1984 |pmid=6230745 |doi=10.1016/0039-6257(84)90094-8}}</ref> and so this finding, though a classic sign of the disease, tends not to be of primary diagnostic importance.

[[Image:Corneal topography right ax.jpg|thumb|Corneal topogram of a keratoconic eye]]
A handheld [[keratoscope]], sometimes known as "Placido's disk", can provide a simple [[Non-invasive (medical)|noninvasive]] visualization of the surface of the cornea by projecting a series of concentric rings of light onto the cornea. A more definitive diagnosis can be obtained using [[corneal topography]], in which an automated instrument projects the illuminated pattern onto the cornea and determines its topology from analysis of the digital image. The topographical map indicates any distortions or scarring in the cornea, with keratoconus revealed by a characteristic steepening of curvature which is usually below the centreline of the eye.<ref name="puco"/> The technique can record a snapshot of the degree and extent of the deformation as a benchmark for assessing its rate of progression. It is of particular value in detecting the disorder in its early stages when other signs have not yet presented.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maguire LJ, Bourne WM |title=Corneal topography of early keratoconus |journal=American Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=107–12 |year=1989 |month=August |pmid=2757091}}</ref>

Once keratoconus has been diagnosed, its degree may be classified by several metrics:<ref name="Gupta">{{cite web | author=Gupta D| title=Keratoconus: A clinical update| format=PDF | work= | url=http://www.optometry.co.uk/files/882ed4bcea848897cbbe928e8bd1b0c3_gupta20050715.pdf | accessdate=2006-03-26|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060515104049/http://www.optometry.co.uk/files/882ed4bcea848897cbbe928e8bd1b0c3_gupta20050715.pdf |archivedate = May 15, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

:* The steepness of greatest curvature from 'mild' (< 45 [[dioptre|D]]), 'advanced' (up to 52 [[dioptre|D]]) or 'severe' (> 52 [[dioptre|D]]);
:* The morphology of the cone: 'nipple' (small: 5 mm and near-central), 'oval' (larger, below-center and often sagging), or 'globus' (more than 75% of cornea affected);
:* The corneal thickness from mild (> 506 μm) to advanced (< 446 μm).

Increasing use of corneal topography has led to a decline in use of these terms.<ref name="Gupta"/>

Despite considerable research, the [[etiology]] of keratoconus remains unclear.<ref name="puco"/> Several sources suggest that keratoconus likely arises from a number of different factors: genetic, environmental or cellular, any of which may form the trigger for the onset of the disease.<ref name="grayson">{{cite book | first = | last =Arffa R| authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1997| month = | title =  Grayson's Diseases of the Cornea.

As the two come into contact, cellular and structural changes in the cornea adversely affect its integrity and lead to the bulging and scarring characteristic of the disorder. Within any individual keratoconic cornea, regions of degenerative thinning coexisting with regions undergoing wound healing may be found. Scarring appears to be an aspect of the corneal degradation; however, a recent, large, multicenter study suggests abrasion by contact lenses may increase the likelihood of this finding by a factor over two.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barr JT |title=Estimation of the incidence and factors predictive of corneal scarring in the Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Keratoconus (CLEK) Study |journal=Cornea |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=16–25 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16331035 |doi=10.1097/01.ico.0000164831.87593.08 |author-separator=, |author2=Wilson BS |author3=Gordon MO |display-authors=3 |last4=Rah |first4=Marjorie J |last5=Riley |first5=Colleen |last6=Kollbaum |first6=Pete S |last7=Zadnik |first7=Karla |last8=Clek Study |first8=Group}}</ref>

=== Contact lenses ===
{{main|Contact lens}}
[[Image:KC-lens.jpg|thumb|Rigid, gas-permeable lens for keratoconus]]
In early stages of keratoconus, [[Glasses|spectacles]] or soft contact lenses can suffice to correct for the mild astigmatism. As the condition progresses, these may no longer provide the patient with a satisfactory degree of visual acuity, and most clinical practitioners will move to manage the condition with rigid contact lenses, known as [[Rigid Gas Permeable|rigid, gas-permeable]], (RGP) lenses. RGP lenses provide a good level of visual correction, but do not arrest progression of the condition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsite/public_cornealdyst.hcsp|title=Corneal Dystrophies (including Keratoconus)|work=Eye Info|publisher=[[RNIB]]|accessdate=20 January 2009}}</ref>

In keratoconic patients, rigid contact lenses improve vision by means of [[tears|tear fluid]] filling the gap between the irregular corneal surface and the smooth regular inner surface of the lens, thereby creating the effect of a smoother cornea. Many specialized types of contact lenses have been developed for keratoconus, and affected people may seek out both doctors specialized in conditions of the cornea, and contact lens fitters who have experience managing patients with keratoconus. The irregular cone presents a challenge<ref name="grayson"/> and the fitter will endeavor to produce a lens with the optimal contact, stability and steepness. Some trial-and-error fitting may prove necessary.<ref name="Krachmer"/>

Traditionally, contact lenses for keratoconus have been the 'hard' or RGP variety, although manufacturers have also produced specialized 'soft' or [[hydrophilic]] lenses and, most recently, silicone hydrogel lenses. A soft lens has a tendency to conform to the conical shape of the cornea, thus diminishing its effect. To counter this, hybrid lenses have been developed which are hard in the centre and encompassed by a soft skirt. However, soft or earlier generation hybrid lenses did not prove effective for every patient.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rubinstein MP, Sud S |title=The use of hybrid lenses in management of the irregular cornea |journal=Contact Lens & Anterior Eye |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=87–90 |year=1999 |pmid=16303411 |doi=10.1016/S1367-0484(99)80044-7}}</ref> Early generation lenses like SoftPerm have been discontinued.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.contactlensheadlines.com/2010/06/softperm-hybrid-contact-lenses-discontinued/|title = SoftPerm Hybrid Contact Lenses Discountinued=}}</ref> The fourth generation of hybrid lens technology has improved significantly, giving more patients an option that combines the comfort of a soft lens with the visual acuity of an RGP lens.<ref>Davis Robert, Eiden Barry. ''Hybrid Contact Lens Management''. Contact Lens Spectrum: [http://www.clspectrum.com/article.aspx?article=104099].</ref> The new generation of technology fixes the issues prevalent in earlier generations and allows contact lenses to be fitted for the majority of patients.<ref>Davis Robert. ''Recent Hybrid Lens Technology''. TreatKerataconus: [http://treatkeratoconus.com/blog/evolution-of-a-hybrid-lens-part-2/].</ref>

Some patients also find good vision correction and comfort with a "piggyback" lens combination, in which RGP lenses are worn over soft lenses, both providing a degree of vision correction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yeung K, Eghbali F, Weissman BA |title=Clinical experience with piggyback contact lens systems on keratoconic eyes |journal=Journal of the American Optometric Association |volume=66 |issue=9 |pages=539–43 |year=1995 |month=September |pmid=7490414}}</ref> One form of piggyback lens makes use of a soft lens with a countersunk central area to accept the rigid lens. Fitting a piggyback lens combination requires experience on the part of the lens fitter, and tolerance on the part of the keratoconic patient.

In the USA, corneal transplants (also known as corneal grafts) for keratoconus are usually performed under sedation as [[outpatient]] surgery. In other countries, such as Australia and the UK, the operation is commonly performed with the patient undergoing a general anaesthetic. All cases require a careful follow-up with an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) for a number of years. Frequently, vision is greatly improved after the surgery, but even if the actual visual acuity does not improve, because the cornea is a more normal shape after the healing is completed, patients can more easily be fitted with corrective lenses. Complications of corneal transplants are mostly related to vascularization of the corneal tissue and [[transplant rejection|rejection]] of the donor cornea. [[Vision loss]] is very rare, though difficult-to-correct vision is possible. When rejection is severe, repeat transplants are often attempted, and are frequently successful.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Al-Mezaine H, Wagoner MD |title=Repeat penetrating keratoplasty: indications, graft survival, and visual outcome |journal=The British Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=324–7 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16488955 |pmc=1856933 |doi=10.1136/bjo.2005.079624}}</ref> Keratoconus will not normally reoccur in the transplanted cornea; incidences of this have been observed, but are usually attributed to incomplete excision of the original cornea or inadequate screening of the donor tissue.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rubinfeld RS, Traboulsi EI, Arentsen JJ, Eagle RC |title=Keratoconus after penetrating keratoplasty |journal=Ophthalmic Surgery |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=420–2 |year=1990 |month=June |pmid=2381677}}</ref> The long-term outlook for corneal transplants performed for keratoconus is usually favorable once the initial healing period is completed and a few years have elapsed without problems.

==== Corneal ring segment inserts ====
{{main|Intrastromal corneal ring segments}}
A recent surgical alternative to corneal transplant is the insertion of intrastromal corneal ring segments. A small incision is made in the periphery of the cornea and two thin arcs of [[polymethyl methacrylate]] are slid between the layers of the stroma on either side of the [[pupil]] before the incision is closed.<ref name="ophthalmology">{{cite book | first = | last =Yanoff M, Duker J | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2004 | month = | title = Ophthalmology| chapter = | editor =  | others = | edition =2nd | pages = | publisher = Mosby | location = | isbn = 0-323-01634-0| url = }}</ref> The segments push out against the curvature of the cornea, flattening the peak of the cone and returning it to a more natural shape. The procedure, carried out on an outpatient basis under [[local anaesthesia]], offers the benefit of being reversible and even potentially exchangeable as it involves no removal of eye tissue.<ref name="ophthalmology"/>

The principal intrastromal ring available is known by the trade name Intacs. Internationally, Ferrara rings are also available. Intacs are a patented technology and are placed outside the optical zone, whereas the smaller prismatic Ferrara rings are placed just inside the 5&nbsp;mm optical zone. Intacs are the only corneal implants to have gone through the FDA Phase I, II and III clinical trials and were first approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in the United States in 1999 for [[myopia]]; this was extended to the treatment of keratoconus in July 2004.<ref>US FDA, ''New Humanitarian Device Approval'' [http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/mda/docs/h040002.html INTACS Prescription Inserts for Keratoconus - H040002]</ref>

[[Image:IntacsAfterInsertion.jpg|thumb|left|A pair of Intacs after insertion into the cornea]]

In common with penetrating keratoplasty, the requirement for some vision correction in the form of spectacles or hydrophilic contact lenses may remain subsequent to the operation. Potential complications of intrastromal rings include accidental penetration through to the anterior chamber when forming the channel, postoperative [[infection]] of the cornea, and migration or extrusion of the segments.<ref name="Ferrara"/> The rings offer a good chance of vision improvement even in otherwise hard-to-manage eyes, but results are not guaranteed and in a few cases may worsen.

Early studies on intrastromal corneal rings involved use of two segments to cause global flattening of the cornea.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Boxer Wachler | first1 = BS | last2 = Christie | first2 = JP | last3 = Chandra | first3 = NS | last4 = Chou | first4 = B | last5 = Korn | first5 = T | last6 = Nepomuceno | first6 = R | title = Intacs for keratoconus | journal = Ophthalmology | volume = 110 | issue = 5 | pages = 1031–40 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12750109 | doi = 10.1016/S0161-6420(03)00094-0 }}</ref> A later study reported better results could be obtained for those cones located more to the periphery of the cornea by using a single Intacs segment.

==== Radial keratotomy ====
{{main|Radial keratotomy}}
Radial keratotomy is a [[refractive surgery]] procedure developed by Russian ophtalmologist [[Svyatoslav Fyodorov]] in 1974, where the surgeon makes a spoke-like pattern of incisions into the cornea to modify its shape. This early surgical option for [[myopia]] has been largely superseded by [[LASIK]] and other similar procedures. LASIK is absolutely contraindicated in keratoconus and other corneal thinning conditions as removal of corneal stromal tissue will further damage an already thin and weak cornea.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jabbur NS, Stark WJ, Green WR |title=Corneal ectasia after laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis |journal=Archives of Ophthalmology |volume=119 |issue=11 |pages=1714–6 |year=2001 |month=November |pmid=11709027 |doi=10.1001/archopht.119.11.1714}}</ref>

For similar reasons, radial keratotomy has also generally not been used for keratoconic patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Colin J, Velou S |title=Current surgical options for keratoconus |journal=Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=379–86 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12648653 |doi=10.1016/S0886-3350(02)01968-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bergmanson JP, Farmer EJ |title=A return to primitive practice?

====Mini asymmetric radial keratotomy====
{{main|Mini asymmetric radial keratotomy}}
The mini asymmetric radial keratotomy is a surgical technique developed by Italian ophthalmologist [[Marco Abbondanza]] in 1994 and improved in 2005. It consists of a series of micro-incisions, always made with a diamond knife, designed to cause a controlled scarring of the [[cornea]], which changes its thickness and shape. This procedure, if done properly, is able to correct [[astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]] and cure the first and second stage of keratoconus, avoiding the need for a [[cornea transplant]].<ref>{{cite pmid|9183763}}</ref><ref>http://www.centronazionalelaser.com/sito%20dentro/mini%20cheratotomia.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Felicita Donalisio - Sab, 24/05/2008 - 02:05 |url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/medicina/la_curva_pericolosa__cornea/24-05-2008/articolo-id=263900-page=0-comments=1 |title=La curva pericolosa della cornea |language={{it icon}} |publisher=IlGiornale.it |date=2008-05-24 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1055/s-2008-1045898}}</ref>The Mini Asymmetric Radial Keratotomy can also be used in combination with the [[Cross-linking (surgery)|cross-linking]] (also known as CXL, CCR, CCL and KXL), parasurgical treatment for keratoconus.<ref>[http://bmctoday.net/crstodayeurope/2009/08/article.asp?f=0709_12.php Da bmctoday.net]</ref><ref>[http://www.tv.mediaset.it/quimediaset/comunicati/comunicato_3124.shtml Da tv.mediaset.it]</ref>

==== DALK transplants ====
One way of reducing the risk of rejection is to use a technique called deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK). In a DALK graft, only the outermost epithelium and the main bulk of the cornea, the stroma, are replaced; the patient's rearmost [[Corneal endothelium|endothelium]] layer and the [[Descemet's membrane]] are left, giving some additional structural integrity to the postgraft cornea.<ref name="sugita">{{Cite journal | last = Sugita | first = Juntaru | title = Advances in Corneal Research: Selected Transactions of the World Congress on the Cornea | volume = IV | pages = 163–166 | year = 1997}}</ref> Furthermore, it is possible to transplant [[Freeze drying|freeze-dried]] donor tissue. The freeze-drying process ensures this tissue is dead, so there is no chance of rejection.<ref name="sugita"/>

Some surgeons prefer to remove the donor epithelium; others leave it in place. Removing it can cause a slight improvement in overall vision, but a corresponding increase in visual recovery time.

==== Epikeratophakia ====
Rarely, a nonpenetrating keratoplasty known as an epikeratophakia (or epikeratoplasty) may be performed in cases of keratoconus. The corneal epithelium is removed and a lenticule of donor cornea is grafted on top of it.<ref name="grayson"/> The procedure requires a greater level of skill on the part of the surgeon, and is less frequently performed than a penetrating keratoplasty, as the outcome is generally less favorable. However, it may be seen as an option in a number of cases, particularly for young patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wagoner MD, Smith SD, Rademaker WJ, Mahmood MA |title=Penetrating keratoplasty vs. epikeratoplasty for the surgical treatment of keratoconus |journal=Journal of Refractive Surgery |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=138–46 |year=2001 |pmid=11310764}}</ref>

== Prognosis ==
[[File:David G Cogan collection Case 244 photo 2 keratoconus Descemet rupture.gif|thumb|A small rupture of [[Descemet's membrane]] (magnified view) ...]]
Patients with keratoconus typically present initially with mild [[Astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]] and myopia, commonly at the onset of [[puberty]], and are diagnosed by the late teenage years or early 20s. The disease can, however, present or progress at any age; in rare cases, keratoconus can present in children or not until later adulthood.<ref name="epstein"/> A diagnosis of the disease at an early age may indicate a greater risk of severity in later life.<ref name="puco"/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0953-4431(96)00201-9 |title=Keratoconus: Current understanding of diagnosis and management |year=1997 |last1=Davis |first1=L |journal=Clinical Eye and Vision Care |volume=9 |page=13}}</ref> Patients' vision will seem to fluctuate over a period of months, driving them to change lens prescriptions frequently, but as the condition worsens, [[contact lens]]es are required in the majority of cases. The course of the disorder can be quite variable, with some patients remaining stable for years or indefinitely, while others progress rapidly or experience occasional exacerbations over a long and otherwise steady course. Most commonly, keratoconus progresses for a period of 10 to 20 years<ref name="Krachmer"/> before the course of the disease generally ceases in the third and fourth decades of life.

[[Image:Hydrops (descemets membrane rupture) due to keratoconus.jpg|right|thumb|... leads to corneal hydrops.]]
In advanced cases, bulging of the cornea can result in a localized rupture of [[Descemet's membrane]], an inner layer of the cornea. [[Aqueous humor]] from the eye's [[anterior chamber]] seeps into the cornea before Descemet's membrane reseals. The patient experiences pain and a sudden severe clouding of vision, with the cornea taking on a translucent milky-white appearance known as a corneal hydrops.<ref name="Grewal">{{cite journal |author=Grewal S, Laibson PR, Cohen EJ, Rapuano CJ |title=Acute hydrops in the corneal ectasias: associated factors and outcomes |journal=Transactions of the American Ophthalmological Society |volume=97 |issue= |pages=187–98; discussion 198–203 |year=1999 |pmid=10703124 |pmc=1298260}}</ref> Although disconcerting to the patient, the effect is normally temporary and after a period of six to eight weeks, the cornea usually returns to its former transparency. The recovery can be aided nonsurgically by bandaging with an [[osmosis|osmotic]] [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] solution. Although a hydrops usually causes increased scarring of the cornea, occasionally it will benefit a patient by creating a flatter cone, aiding the fitting of contact lenses.<ref name="Grewal"/> Occasionally, the cornea thins to the point where a partial rupture occurs at the level of Descemet's membrane, resulting in a small, bead-like swelling on the cornea that may become filled with fluid (cornea hydropsy). When this occurs, severe vision decrease may occur until the edema slowly resolves. Corneal transplantation is not usually indicated while the hydropsy persists.

Keratoconus is normally bilateral<ref name="Kennedy"/> (affecting both eyes) although the distortion is usually asymmetric and is rarely completely identical in both corneas.<ref name="epstein"/> Unilateral cases tend to be uncommon, and may in fact be very rare if a very mild condition in the better eye is simply below the limit of clinical detection.<ref name="Krachmer"/> It is common for keratoconus to be diagnosed first in one eye and not until later in the other. As the condition then progresses in both eyes, the vision in the earlier-diagnosed eye will often remain poorer than that in its fellow.

== History ==
[[Image:Conicalcornea.jpg|thumb|''Practical observations on conical cornea'', Nottingham's ground-breaking text on keratoconus, 1854]]
The German [[ophthalmology|oculist]] [[Burchard Mauchart]] provided an early description in a 1748 doctoral dissertation of a case of keratoconus,<ref name="puco">{{cite web | author=Caroline P, Andre M, Kinoshita B, and Choo, J| title=Etiology, Diagnosis, and Management of Keratoconus: New Thoughts and New Understandings| work=Pacific University College of Optometry | url=http://www.pacificu.edu/optometry/ce/courses/15167/etiologypg1.cfm | accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref> which he called ''staphyloma diaphanum''. However, it was not until 1854 that British physician [[John Nottingham]] clearly described keratoconus and distinguished it from other [[ectasia]]s of the cornea.<ref name="puco"/> Nottingham reported the cases of "conical cornea" that had come to his attention, and described several classic features of the disease, including [[Diplopia|polyopia]], weakness of the cornea, and difficulty matching corrective lenses to the patient's vision.<ref name="nottingham">Nottingham J. ''Practical observations on conical cornea: and on the short sight, and other defects of vision connected with it.'' London: J. Churchill, 1854.</ref> In 1859, British surgeon [[Sir William Bowman, 1st Baronet|William Bowman]] used an [[ophthalmoscope]] (recently invented by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]) to diagnose keratoconus, and described how to angle the instrument's mirror so as to best see the conical shape of the cornea.<ref>Bowman W, ''On conical cornea and its treatment by operation.''

He reported that he had had a measure of success with the technique, restoring vision to an 18-year old woman who had previously been unable to count fingers at a distance of 8&nbsp;inches (20&nbsp;cm). By 1869, when the pioneering Swiss ophthalmologist [[Johann Horner]] wrote a thesis entitled ''On the treatment of keratoconus'',<ref>Horner JF, ''Zur Behandlung des Keratoconus.'' Klinische Monatsblätter für Augenheilkunde. 1869.</ref> the disorder had acquired its current name. The treatment at that time, endorsed by the leading German ophthalmologist [[Albrecht von Graefe]], was an attempt to physically reshape the cornea by chemical cauterization with a [[silver nitrate]] solution and application of a [[miosis]]-causing agent with a pressure dressing.<ref name="puco"/> In 1888, the treatment of keratoconus became one of the first practical applications of the then newly invented [[contact lens]], when the French physician [[Eugène Kalt]] manufactured a glass scleral shell that improved vision by compressing the cornea into a more regular shape.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pearson RM |title=Kalt, keratoconus, and the contact lens |journal=Optometry and Vision Science |volume=66 |issue=9 |pages=643–6 |year=1989 |month=September |pmid=2677884 |doi=10.1097/00006324-198909000-00011}}</ref> Since the start of the 20th century, research on keratoconus has both improved understanding of the disease and greatly expanded the range of treatment options.

Several other noninflammatory eye disorders, generally rarer than keratoconus, also cause thinning of the cornea:<ref name="Krachmer"/>

*'''[[Keratoglobus]]''' is a very rare condition that causes corneal thinning primarily at the margins, resulting in a spherical, slightly enlarged eye. It may be genetically related to keratoconus.<ref name="grayson"/>
*'''[[Pellucid marginal degeneration]]''' causes thinning of a narrow (1–2&nbsp;mm) band of the cornea, usually along the inferior corneal margin. It causes irregular astigmatism that, in the early stages of the disease can be corrected by spectacles. Differential diagnosis may be made by slit-lamp examination.<ref name="rabonitz"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Jinabhai|first=Amit|coauthors=Hema Radhakrishnan, Clare O’Donnell|title=Pellucid corneal marginal degeneration: A review|journal=Contact Lens & Anterior Eye|date=23|year=2010|month=December|volume=34|pages=56–63|pmid=21185225|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367048410001530|accessdate=9 July 2012|issue=2|doi=10.1016/j.clae.2010.11.007}}</ref> 
*'''[[Posterior keratoconus]]''', a distinct disorder despite its similar name, is a rare abnormality, usually congenital, which causes a nonprogressive thinning of the inner surface of the cornea, while the curvature of the anterior surface remains normal. Usually only a single eye is affected.<ref name="grayson"/>
