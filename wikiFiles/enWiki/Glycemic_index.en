The '''glycemic index''', or '''glycaemic index''', ('''GI''') provides a measure of how quickly [[blood sugar]] levels (i.e., levels of [[glucose]] in the blood) rise after eating a particular type of food. The effects that different foods have on blood sugar levels vary considerably. The glycemic index estimates how much each gram of available [[carbohydrate]] (total carbohydrate minus fiber) in a food raises a person's blood glucose level following consumption of the food, relative to consumption of pure glucose.<ref name="glycemic1">{{cite web|url=http://www.glycemic.com/GlycemicIndex-LoadDefined.htm |title=Glycemic Index Defined |publisher=Glycemic Research Institute |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref> Glucose has a glycemic index of 100.

A practical limitation of the glycemic index is that it does not take into account the amount of carbohydrate actually consumed. A related measure, the [[glycemic load]], factors this in by multiplying the glycemic index of the food in question by the carbohydrate content of the actual serving.

==Accuracy==
Glycemic index charts often give only one value per food, but variations are possible due to variety, ripeness, cooking methods, processing, and the length of storage. [[Potatoes]] are a notable example, ranging from moderate to very high GI even within the same variety.<ref name="web.archive">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090215175517/http://ziag4.mmb.usyd.edu.au/FMPro?-db=gidb2.fp5&-format=resultsv4a.htm&-lay=tableview&-sortfield=none&-sortorder=descend&FoodName=potato&-max=20&-skip=20&-find= |title=GI Database |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref><ref name="freeman"/>

The glycemic response is different from one person to another, and even in the same person from day to day, depending on blood glucose levels, [[insulin resistance]], and other factors.<ref name="freeman">{{cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Janine|title=The Glycemic Index debate: Does the type of carbohydrate really matter?|url=http://www.diabetes.org/glycemic-index.jsp |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070214135006/http://www.diabetes.org/glycemic-index.jsp|archivedate=February 14, 2007|month=September|year=2005|journal=Diabetes Forecast}}</ref>

Most of the values on the glycemic index do not show the impact on glucose levels after two hours. Some people with diabetes may have elevated levels after four hours.<ref name="freeman" />

==Determining the GI of a food==
Foods with carbohydrates that break down quickly during digestion and release glucose rapidly into the [[bloodstream]] tend to have a high GI; foods with carbohydrates that break down more slowly, releasing glucose more gradually into the bloodstream, tend to have a low GI. The concept was developed by Dr. [[David J. Jenkins]] and colleagues<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jenkins DJ, Wolever TM, Taylor RH, ''et al.'' |title=Glycemic index of foods: a physiological basis for carbohydrate exchange |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=362–6 |year=1981 |month=March |pmid=6259925 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6259925}}</ref> in 1980–1981 at the [[University of Toronto]] in their research to find out which foods were best for people with [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]].
A lower glycemic index suggests slower rates of digestion and absorption of the foods' carbohydrates and may also indicate greater extraction from the liver and periphery of the products of carbohydrate digestion. A lower glycemic response usually equates to a lower insulin demand but not always, and may improve long-term blood glucose control<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jenkins DJ, Kendall CW, McKeown-Eyssen G, ''et al.'' |title=Effect of a low-glycemic index or a high-cereal fiber diet on type 2 diabetes: a randomized trial |journal=JAMA |volume=300 |issue=23 |pages=2742–53 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19088352 |doi=10.1001/jama.2008.808 |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.2008.808}}</ref> and [[blood lipids]]. The [[insulin index]] is also useful for providing a direct measure of the insulin response to a food.

The glycemic index of a food is defined as the incremental area under the two-hour blood glucose response curve ([[Area under the curve|AUC]]) following a 12-hour fast and ingestion of a food with a certain quantity of available carbohydrate (usually 50 g). The AUC of the test food is divided by the AUC of the standard (either glucose or white bread, giving two different definitions) and multiplied by 100. The average GI value is calculated from data collected in 10 human subjects. Both the standard and test food must contain an equal amount of available carbohydrate. The result gives a relative ranking for each tested food.<ref name="glycemic1"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Brouns F, Bjorck I, Frayn KN, ''et al.'' |title=Glycaemic index methodology |journal=Nutr Res Rev |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=145–71 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=19079901 |doi=10.1079/NRR2005100 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0954422405000119}}</ref>

The current validated methods use glucose as the reference food, giving it a glycemic index value of 100 by definition. This has the advantages of being universal and producing maximum GI values of approximately 100. White bread can also be used as a reference food, giving a different set of GI values (if white bread = 100, then glucose ≈ 140). For people whose [[Staple food|staple]] carbohydrate source is white bread, this has the advantage of conveying directly whether replacement of the dietary staple with a different food would result in faster or slower blood glucose response. The disadvantages with this system are that the reference food is not well-defined.

==Glycemic index of foods==
GI values can be interpreted intuitively as percentages on an absolute scale and are commonly interpreted as follows:

A low-GI food will release glucose more slowly and steadily, which leads to more suitable postprandial (after meal) blood glucose readings.
A high-GI food causes a more rapid rise in blood glucose levels and is suitable for energy recovery after exercise or for a person experiencing [[hypoglycemia]].

The glycemic effect of foods depends on a number of factors such as the type of [[starch]] ([[amylose]] versus [[amylopectin]]), physical entrapment of the starch molecules within the food, fat and protein content of the food and organic acids or their salts in the meal — adding [[vinegar]], for example, will lower the GI. The presence of fat or soluble [[dietary fiber]] can slow the gastric emptying rate, thus lowering the GI. In general, coarse, grainy breads with higher amounts of fiber have a lower GI value than white breads.<ref name="nord2005:589">{{cite book |title=Glycemic Index: From Research to Nutrition Recommendations? |publisher=Nordic Council of Ministers |location=Copenhagen |year=2005 |isbn=92-893-1256-4 |url=http://www.norden.org/en/publications/publikationer/2005-589 |id=TemaNord2005:589 }}</ref> However, most breads made with 100% wholewheat or wholemeal flour have a GI not a whole lot different than [[endosperm]] only (white) bread.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Atkinson FS, Foster-Powell K, Brand-Miller JC |title=International tables of glycemic index and glycemic load values: 2008 |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=31 |issue=12 |pages=2281–3 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=18835944 |pmc=2584181 |doi=10.2337/dc08-1239 |url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18835944}}</ref> Many brown breads are treated with [[enzyme]]s to soften the crust, which makes the starch more accessible (high GI).

While adding fat or protein will lower the glycemic response to a meal, the relative differences remain. That is, with or without additions, there is still a higher blood glucose curve after a high GI bread than after a low-GI bread such as [[pumpernickel]].

Fruits and vegetables tend to have a low glycemic index. The glycemic index can be applied only to foods where the test relies on subjects consuming an amount of food containing 50 g of available carbohydrate. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}} But many fruits and vegetables (not potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn) contain less than 50 g of available carbohydrate per typical serving. Carrots were originally and incorrectly reported as having a high GI.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Jennie |last1=Brand-Miller |first2=Kaye |last2=Foster-Powell |title=The Low GI Diet Revolution: The Definitive Science-Based Weight Loss Plan |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cUz1wJMlGDkC&pg=PA139 |year=2005 |publisher=Marlowe & Company |isbn=978-1-56924-413-5 |page=139}}</ref> Alcoholic beverages have been reported to have low GI values, but it should be noted that beer has a moderate GI.

Many modern diets rely on the glycemic index, including the [[South Beach Diet]], Transitions by Market America and [[Nutrisystems Diet|NutriSystem Nourish Diet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080306183614/http://www.nutrisystem.com/nourishprogram/gichart.cfm |title=Nutrisystem |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-03-06 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref> However, others have pointed out that foods generally considered to be unhealthy can have a low glycemic index, for instance, [[chocolate cake]] (GI 38), ice cream (37), or pure [[fructose]] (19), whereas foods like potatoes and rice, eaten in countries with low rates of diabetes, have GIs around 100.<ref name=McDougall>[[John A.

The GI Symbol Program is an independent worldwide GI certification program that helps consumers identify low-GI foods and drinks. The symbol is only on foods or beverages that have had their GI values tested according to standard and meet the GI Foundation's certification criteria as a healthy choice within their food group, so they are also lower in kilojoules, fat and/or salt.

==Weight control==
Recent animal research provides compelling evidence that high-GI carbohydrate is associated with increased risk of [[obesity]]. In one study,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pawlak DB, Kushner JA, Ludwig DS |title=Effects of dietary glycaemic index on adiposity, glucose homoeostasis, and plasma lipids in animals |journal=Lancet |volume=364 |issue=9436 |pages=778–85 |year=2004 |pmid=15337404 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16937-7 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673604169377}}</ref> male rats were split into high- and low-GI groups over 18 weeks while mean [[body weight]] was maintained. Rats fed the high-GI diet were 71% fatter and had 8% less lean body mass than the low-GI group. Postmeal [[glycemia]] and [[insulin]] levels were significantly higher, and plasma [[triglyceride]]s were threefold greater in the high-GI-fed rats. Furthermore, [[Islets of Langerhans|pancreatic islet cells]] suffered "severely disorganised architecture and extensive [[fibrosis]]." However, the GI of these diets was not experimentally determined. Because high-amylose [[cornstarch]] (the major component of the assumed low-GI diet) contains large amounts of [[resistant starch]], which is not digested and absorbed as glucose, the lower glycemic response and possibly the beneficial effects can be attributed to lower energy density and fermentation products of the resistant starch, rather than the GI.

In humans, a 2012 study shows that, after weight loss, the energy expenditure is higher on a low-glycemic index diet than on a low-fat diet (but lower than on the [[Atkins diet]]).<ref name=Ebbeling2012>{{cite journal |author=Ebbeling CB, Swain JF, Feldman HA, ''et al.'' |title=Effects of dietary composition on energy expenditure during weight-loss maintenance |journal=JAMA |volume=307 |issue=24 |pages=2627–34 |year=2012 |month=June |pmid=22735432 |doi=10.1001/jama.2012.6607 |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.2012.6607 |pmc=3564212}}</ref> See also news coverage<ref>{{cite news |last=Wanjek |first=Christopher |url= http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=when-dieting-not-all-calo&fb_source=message |title=When Dieting, Not All Calories Are Created Equal |work=Scientific American |date=27 June 2012 }}</ref> and reactions from other obesity researchers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bray GA |title=Diet and exercise for weight loss |journal=JAMA |volume=307 |issue=24 |pages=2641–2 |year=2012 |month=June |pmid=22735436 |doi=10.1001/jama.2012.7263 |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.2012.7263}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Kolata |first=Gina |title=In Dieting, Magic Isn't a Substitute for Science |newspaper=The New York Times |date=9 July 2012 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/10/health/nutrition/q-and-a-are-high-protein-low-carb-diets-effective.html}}</ref>

==Disease prevention==
Several lines of recent [1999] scientific evidence have shown that individuals who followed a low-GI diet over many years were at a significantly lower risk for developing both [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], [[coronary disease|coronary heart disease]], and age-related macular degeneration than others.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chiu CJ, Liu S, Willett WC, ''et al.'' |title=Informing food choices and health outcomes by use of the dietary glycemic index |journal=Nutr.

High blood glucose levels or repeated glycemic "spikes" following a meal may promote these diseases by increasing [[systemic glycative stress]], other [[oxidative stress]] to the vasculature, and also by the direct increase in insulin levels.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Temelkova-Kurktschiev TS, Koehler C, Henkel E, Leonhardt W, Fuecker K, Hanefeld M |title=Postchallenge plasma glucose and glycemic spikes are more strongly associated with atherosclerosis than fasting glucose or HbA1c level |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=23 |issue=12 |pages=1830–4 |year=2000 |month=December |pmid=11128361 |url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11128361 |doi=10.2337/diacare.23.12.1830}}</ref>
The glycative stress sets up a vicious cycle of systemic protein glycation, compromised protein editing capacity involving the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway and autophagic pathways, leading to enhanced accumulation of glycated and other obsolete proteins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Uchiki T, Weikel KA, Jiao W, ''et al.'' |title=Glycation-altered proteolysis as a pathobiologic mechanism that links dietary glycemic index, aging, and age-related disease (in nondiabetics) |journal=Aging Cell |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |year=2012 |month=February |pmid=21967227 |doi=10.1111/j.1474-9726.2011.00752.x |pmc=3257376 }}</ref>

In the past, [[postprandial]] [[hyperglycemia]] has been considered a risk factor associated mainly with diabetes. However, more recent evidence shows that it also presents an increased risk for [[atherosclerosis]] in the non-diabetic population<ref>{{cite journal |author=Balkau B, Shipley M, Jarrett RJ, ''et al.'' |title=High blood glucose concentration is a risk factor for mortality in middle-aged nondiabetic men. 20-year follow-up in the Whitehall Study, the Paris Prospective Study, and the Helsinki Policemen Study |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=360–7 |year=1998 |month=March |pmid=9540016 |doi=10.2337/diacare.21.3.360 }}</ref> and that high GI diets<ref>{{cite web|author=Allan L said at October 23, 2006 6:20 AM: |url=http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/003818.html |title=High Glycemic Index Diet Kidney Cancer Risk? |work=FuturePundit |date=2006-10-21 |accessdate=2012-02-21}}</ref> and high blood-sugar levels more generally<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/complications/kidney-disease-nephropathy.html |title=Kidney Disease (Nephropathy) - American Diabetes Association |work=Diabetes.org |accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref> and<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Diabetes_and_kidney_failure |title=Diabetes and kidney failure |work=Better Health Channel |publisher=State Government of Victoria |accessdate=2012-02-21}}</ref> are related to kidney disease as well.

Conversely, there are areas such as [[Peru]] and Asia, where people eat high-glycemic index foods such as potatoes and high-GI rices, but without a high level of obesity or diabetes.<ref name=McDougall/> The high consumption of [[legume]]s in South America and fresh fruit and vegetables in Asia likely lowers the glycemic effect in these individuals. The mixing of high- and low-GI carbohydrates produces moderate GI values.

A study from the [[University of Sydney]] in Australia suggests that having a breakfast of white bread and sugar-rich cereals, over time, may make a person susceptible to diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer.<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/White_bread_breakfast_unhealthy/articleshow/2851289.cms "White bread breakfast unhealthy?"]. {{dead link|date=July 2012}} ''The Times of India''., 10 March 2008.</ref>

A study published in the [[American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] found that age-related adult [[macular degeneration]] (AMD), which leads to blindness, is 42% higher among people with a high-GI diet, and concluded that eating a lower-GI diet would eliminate 20% of AMD cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chiu CJ, Milton RC, Gensler G, Taylor A |title=Association between dietary glycemic index and age-related macular degeneration in nondiabetic participants in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study |journal=Am.

The [[American Diabetes Association]] supports glycemic index but warns that the total amount of carbohydrate in the food is still the strongest and most important indicator, and that everyone should make their own custom method that works best for them.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sheard NF, Clark NG, Brand-Miller JC, ''et al.'' |title=Dietary carbohydrate (amount and type) in the prevention and management of diabetes: a statement by the american diabetes association |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=2266–71 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15333500 |url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15333500 |doi=10.2337/diacare.27.9.2266}}

The [[International Life Sciences Institute]] concluded in 2011 that because there are many different ways of lowering glycemic response, not all of which have the same effects on health, "It is becoming evident that modifying the glycaemic response of the diet should not be seen as a stand-alone strategy but rather as an element of an overall balanced diet and lifestyle."<ref>{{cite book |last=Sadler |first=Michele |title=Food, Glycaemic Response and Health |year=2011 |publisher=ILSI Europe |location=Brussels, Belgium |isbn=9789078637318 |pages=1–30 |url=http://www.ilsi.org/Europe/Pages/ViewItemDetails.aspx?WebId=84D7FA4A-0FD5-40CD-A49A-2DA6FCDFD654&ListId=0348EB34-DF85-49DD-9ADE-77ED136643F1&ItemID=253}}</ref>

==Other factors==
The number of grams of carbohydrate can have a bigger impact than glycemic index on blood sugar levels, depending on quantities. Consuming fewer calories, losing weight, and carbohydrate counting can be better for lowering the blood sugar level.<ref name="freeman" /> Carbohydrates impact glucose levels most profoundly,<ref name="joslin">{{cite web |url=http://www.joslin.org/info/the_glycemic_index_and_diabetes.html |title=The Glycemic Index and Diabetes |publisher=Joslin Diabetes Center |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref> and two foods with the same carbohydrate content are, in general, comparable in their effects on blood sugar.<ref name="joslin" /> A food with a low glycemic index may have a high carbohydrate content or vice versa; this can be accounted for with the glycemic load. Consuming carbohydrates with a low glycemic index and calculating carbohydrate intake would produce the most stable blood sugar levels.

The GI of foods is determined under experimental conditions after an overnight fast, and might not apply to foods consumed later during the day because glycemic response is strongly influenced by the composition of the previous meal, particularly when meals are consumed within an interval of a few hours. Indeed, it has been shown that a high-GI breakfast cereal (GI = 124) elicited a lower increase in blood glucose concentrations at lunch than at breakfast. Also, the difference in glycemic responses induced by the low- and the high-GI breakfast cereals at lunch were lower than that predicted by the large difference in their GI, which was determined at breakfast.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Alternatives and related scales==
The glycemic index does not take into account other factors besides glycemic response, such as [[Insulin#Physiological effects|insulin response]], which is measured by the insulin index and can be more appropriate in representing the effects from some food contents other than carbohydrates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mendosa.com/insulin_index.htm |title=David Mendosa. Insulin Index. July 13, 2003 |publisher=Mendosa.com |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>

Although the Glycemic Index provides some insights into the relative diabetic risk within specific food groups it contains many counter-intuitive ratings. These include suggestions that bread generally has a higher glycemic ranking than sugar and that some potatoes are more glycemic than glucose.

More significantly studies such as that by Bazzano et al.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bazzano LA, Li TY, Joshipura KJ, Hu FB |title=Intake of fruit, vegetables, and fruit juices and risk of diabetes in women |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=1311–7 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18390796 |pmc=2453647 |doi=10.2337/dc08-0080 |url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/31/7/1311.full }}</ref> demonstrate a significant beneficial diabetic effect for fruit compared to a substantial detrimental impact for fruit juice despite these having similar “Low GI” ratings.

From blood glucose curves presented by Brand-Miller et al.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brand-Miller JC, Stockmann K, Atkinson F, Petocz P, Denyer G |title=Glycemic index, postprandial glycemia, and the shape of the curve in healthy subjects: analysis of a database of more than 1,000 foods |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=97–105 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19056599 |doi=10.3945/ajcn.2008.26354 |url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/89/1/97.full }}</ref> the main distinguishing feature between average fruit and fruit juice curves is the maximum slope of the leading edge of 4.38 (mmol/L)/hr for fruit and 6.71 (mmol/L)/hr for fruit juice. This slope represents the maximum rate at which glucose accumulates in the blood stream or MGR and is the rate at which glucose entry into the blood exceeds the ability of the body to remove it.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Extending the assessment from fruit to simple homogeneous solids consisting largely of similar carbohydrates reveals that other diabetic-beneficial foods such as Pasta, low GI white bread and low GI rice also have a MGR around or below 5.0 (mmol/L)/hr. Homogeneous solids associated with high diabetic risk such as potatoes and high GI bread however are observed to have a MGR above 6.0 (mmol/L)/hr.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

As there is a clear relationship between the MGR and GI for homogeneous solids this leads to the alternative concept of a MGR Index. Although the MGR and GI give consistent ratings for homogenous solids, carbohydrate liquids including fruit juice and readily dissolvable sugars such as refined sucrose are highly glycemic using the MGR criteria. As processed carbohydrates are largely a combination of homogeneous solids and sucrose these are also determined to be significantly more glycemic using the MGR as a benchmark.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
