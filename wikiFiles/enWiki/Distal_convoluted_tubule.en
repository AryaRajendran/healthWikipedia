The '''distal convoluted tubule''' ('''DCT''') is a portion of [[kidney]] [[nephron]] between the [[loop of Henle]] and the [[collecting duct system]]. 

== Physiology ==
It is partly responsible for the regulation of [[potassium]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], and [[pH]]. It is the primary site for the kidneys' hormone based regulation of calcium (Ca). 

On its [[Apical membrane|apical]] surface (lumen side), cells of the DCT have a [[thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter]] and are [[Semipermeable membrane|permeable]] to Ca, via TRPV5 channel. On the [[basolateral]] surface (blood) there is an ATP dependent Na/K antiport pump, a secondary active Na/Ca transporter-- [[antiport]], and an [[ATP dependent]] Ca transporter. The basolateral ATP dependent Na/K pump produces the gradient for Na to be absorbed from the apical surface via the Na/Cl [[synport]] and for Ca to be reclaimed into the blood by the Na/Ca basolateral antiport.

* It regulates pH by absorbing [[bicarbonate]] and secreting [[proton]]s (H<sup>+</sup>) into the filtrate, or by absorbing [[proton]]s and secreting [[bicarbonate]] into the filtrate. 

* Sodium and potassium levels are controlled by secreting K<sup>+</sup> and absorbing Na<sup>+</sup>. Sodium absorption by the distal tubule is mediated by the [[hormone]] [[aldosterone]]. Aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption. Sodium and chloride (salt) reabsorption is also mediated by a group of kinases called WNK kinases. There are 4 different WNK kinases, {{Gene|WNK1}}, {{Gene|WNK2}}, {{Gene|WNK3}}, and {{Gene|WNK4}}.

* It also participates in [[calcium]] regulation by reabsorbing Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to parathyroid hormone. <ref>{{LoyolaMedEd|mech/cases/case24/kidney.htm}}</ref> PTH effect is mediated through phosphorylation of regulatory proteins and enhancing the synthesis of all transporters within the distal convoluted tubule.  

* [[Arginine vasopressin receptor 2]] is also expressed in the DCT.

==Clinical significance==
[[Thiazide]] [[diuretic]]s inhibit Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> reabsorption from the DCT by blocking the [[thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter]]. 

By inhibiting the cotransporter, thiazide diuretics increase the gradient potential for Na. This increases the activity of the basolateral Na/Ca antiport and causes the increase in calcium reclamation associated with thiazide diuretics.   

== Histology == <!--Kidney distal tubule cell redirects here-->
The DCT is lined with simple cuboidal cells that are shorter than those of the [[proximal convoluted tubule]] (PCT).  The lumen appears larger in DCT than the PCT lumen because the PCT has a brush border (microvilli).  DCT can be recognized by its numerous [[mitochondria]], basal infoldings and lateral membrane interdigitations with neighboring cells.  

The point where DCT contacts afferent arteriole of renal corpuscle is called [[macula densa]].  It has tightly packed columnar cells which display reversed polarity and may monitor the osmolarity of blood.  

[[Histology|Histologically]], cells of the DCT can be differentiated from cells of the [[proximal convoluted tubule]]:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Characteristic''' || '''PCT''' || '''DCT''' 
 |- 
 | [[Apical membrane|Apical]] [[brush border]] || Usually present|| Not present 
 |- 
 | [[Eosinophil]]icity || More  || Less 
 |- 
 | [[Cytoplasm]] || More || Less 
 |- 
 | Readily discernible [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] || Less likely || More likely
