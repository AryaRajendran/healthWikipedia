The '''globe''' of the [[Human eye|eye]], or '''bulbus oculi''', is the [[Human eye|eyeball]] apart from its [[appendage]]s.<ref>[http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Globe_of_eye "Globe of eye "], ''[[Biology Online]]'', 2009-08-20. Retrieved on 2009-08-20.</ref> A hollow structure, the bulbus oculi is composed of a wall enclosing a cavity filled with fluid with three coats: the [[Sclera]], [[Choroid]], and the [[Retina]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Frederick Randolph|title=Text-book of histology|publisher=W.
