A '''lensmeter''' or '''lensometer''', also known as a '''focimeter''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeiss.de/de/ophthalmic/glossary_e.nsf/frameset.html?ReadForm&Redirect=/C1256E7B002D2A69/0/8BE738D3614A7DD0C1256E8200232F89|title=Ophthalmology Glossary on Carl Zeiss Vision GmbH website}}</ref> is an [[ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] instrument. It is mainly used by [[optometrists]] and [[opticians]] to verify the correct prescription in a pair of [[glasses|eyeglasses]], to properly orient and mark uncut lenses, and to confirm the correct mounting of lenses in spectacle frames. Lensmeters can also verify the power of [[contact lenses]], if a special lens support is used.

The parameters appraised by a lensmeter are the values specified by an [[ophthalmologist]] or [[optometrist]] on the patient's [[Eyeglass prescription|prescription]]: sphere, cylinder, axis, add, and in some cases, prism. The lensmeter is also used to check the accuracy of [[progressive lenses]], and is often capable of marking the lens center and various other measurements critical to proper performance of the lens. It may also be used prior to an [[eye examination]] to obtain the last prescription the patient was given, in order to expedite the subsequent examination.

== History ==
In 1876, [[Hermann Snellen]] introduced a phakometer which was a similar set up to an [[optical table|optical bench]] which could measure the power and find the [[optical centre]] of a convex lens. Troppman went a step further in 1912, introducing the first direct measuring instrument.

In 1922, a patent was filed for the first projection lensmeter, which has a similar system to the standard lensmeter pictured above, but projects the measuring target onto a screen eliminating the need for correction of the observer's [[refractive error]] in the instrument itself and reducing the requirement to peer down a small telescope into the instrument. Despite these advantages the above design is still predominant in the optical world.<ref>http://www.college-optometrists.org/index.aspx/pcms/site.college.What_We_Do.museyeum.online_exhibitions.optical_instruments.focimeter/ accessed 20 Jan 2009</ref>
