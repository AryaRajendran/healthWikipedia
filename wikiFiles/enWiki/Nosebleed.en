'''Epistaxis''' (from {{lang-el|{{lang|grc|επιστάζω}}}} (''epistazo'') to bleed from the nose: {{lang|grc|επί}} (''epi'') - "above", "over" + {{lang|grc|στάζω}} (''stazo'') - "to drip [from the nostrils]") or a '''nosebleed''' is the relatively common occurrence of [[hemorrhage]] from the [[human nose|nose]], usually noticed when the [[blood]] drains out through the [[nostril]]s. There are two types: anterior (the most common), and posterior (less common, more likely to require medical attention). Sometimes in more severe cases, the blood can come up the [[nasolacrimal duct]] and out from the eye. Fresh blood and clotted blood can also flow down into the stomach and cause [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} It is rarely fatal, accounting for only 4 of the 2.4 million deaths in the U.S. in 1999.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statab/vs00199wktbli.pdf  Work Table I.

== Cause ==
The causes of nosebleeds can generally be divided into two categories, local and [[:wikt:systemic|systemic]] factors, although a significant number of nosebleeds occur with no obvious cause.

=== Local factors ===
* [[Blunt trauma]] (usually a sharp blow to the face such as a punch, sometimes accompanying a [[nasal fracture]])
* [[Foreign body|Foreign bodies]] (such as fingers during [[nose-picking]])
* [[Inflammation|Inflammatory reaction]] (''e.g.'' acute [[respiratory tract infection]]s, [[chronic sinusitis]], [[allergic rhinitis]] or environmental [[Irritant (biology)|irritant]]s)

==== Other possible factors ====
* [[Deformity|Anatomical deformities]] (''e.g.'' septal spurs or [[Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia]])
* [[Insufflation (medicine)|Insufflated]] drugs (particularly [[cocaine]])
* Intranasal [[tumor]]s (''e.g.'' [[Nasopharyngeal carcinoma]] or [[nasopharyngeal angiofibroma]])
* Low [[relative humidity]] of inhaled air (particularly during cold winter seasons)
* [[Nasal cannula]] O<sub>2</sub> (tending to dry the [[olfactory mucosa]])
* [[Nasal spray]]s (particularly prolonged or improper use of nasal steroids)
* [[Otic]] [[barotrauma]] (such as from descent in aircraft or ascent in scuba diving)
* Consumption of tainted [[whey]] [[protein supplement|protein supplements]] that contain [[arsenic]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine-archive/2010/july/food/protein-drinks/whats-in-your-protein-drink/index.htm |title=What's in your protein drink |accessdate=29 January 2012}}</ref>
* Surgery (''e.g.'' [[septoplasty]] and [[Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery]])

=== Systemic factors ===
==== Most common factors ====
* [[Infectious diseases]] (''e.g.'' common cold)
* [[Hypertension]]

== Pathophysiology ==
Nosebleeds are due to the rupture of a blood vessel within the richly perfused nasal mucosa. Rupture may be spontaneous or initiated by trauma. Nosebleeds are reported in up to 60% of the population with peak incidences in those under the age of ten and over the age of 50 and appear to occur in males more than females.<ref name="AAFP">{{cite web |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20050115/305.html |title=Management of Epistaxis |author=Corry J. Kucik & Timothy Clenney |date=January 15, 2005 |accessdate=January 31, 2010 |publisher=[[American Academy of Family Physicians]]}}</ref> An increase in blood pressure (e.g. due to general hypertension) tends to increase the duration of spontaneous epistaxis.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00005537-199907000-00019 |author=J. F. Lubianca Neto, F. D. Fuchs, S. R. Facco, M. Gus, L. Fasolo, R. Mafessoni & A. L. Gleissner |title=Is epistaxis evidence of end-organ damage in patients with hypertension? |journal=Laryngoscope |year=1999 |volume=109 |issue=7 |pages=1111–1115 |pmid=10401851}}</ref> [[Anticoagulant]] medication and disorders of blood clotting can promote and prolong bleeding. Spontaneous epistaxis is more common in the elderly as the nasal mucosa (lining) becomes dry and thin and blood pressure tends to be higher. The elderly are also more prone to prolonged nose bleeds as their blood vessels are less able to constrict and control the bleeding.

The vast majority of nose bleeds occur in the [[anterior]] (front) part of the nose from the nasal septum. This area is richly endowed with blood vessels ([[Kiesselbach's plexus]]). This region is also known as [[Little's area]]. Bleeding farther back in the nose is known as a posterior bleed and is usually due to bleeding from Woodruff's plexus, a venous plexus situated in the posterior part of inferior meatus.<ref>
The Journal of Laryngology & Otology (2008), 122: 1074-1077</ref> Posterior bleeds are often prolonged and difficult to control. They can be associated with bleeding from both nostrils and with a greater flow of blood into the mouth.<ref> name="AAFP"/</ref>

== Treatment ==
The flow of blood normally stops when the blood [[coagulation|clots]], which may be encouraged by [[Emergency bleeding control|direct pressure]]  applied by pinching the soft fleshy part of the nose. This applies pressure to [[Little's area]] (Kiesselbach's area), the source of the majority of nose bleeds and promotes clotting. Pressure should be firm and be applied for at least five minutes and up to 20 minutes; tilting the head forward will help decrease the chance of nausea and airway obstruction.<ref name="AAFP"/> Swallowing excess blood can irritate the stomach and cause vomiting.

The local application of a vasoconstrictive agent has been shown to reduce the bleeding time in benign cases of epistaxis. The drugs [[oxymetazoline]] or [[phenylephrine]] are widely available in over-the-counter nasal sprays for the treatment of [[allergic rhinitis]], and may be used for this purpose.<ref name="pmid2676467">{{cite journal |author=Guarisco JL, Graham HD |title=Epistaxis in children: causes, diagnosis, and treatment |journal=Ear Nose Throat J |volume=68 |issue=7 |pages=522, 528–30, 532 passim |year=1989 |pmid=2676467 |doi=}}</ref>
 
If these simple measures do not work then medical intervention may be needed to stop bleeding. In the first instance this can take the form of chemical [[cauterization|cautery]] of any bleeding vessels or packing of the nose with ribbon gauze or an absorbent dressing (called anterior nasal packing). Such procedures are best carried out by a medical professional. Chemical cauterisation is most commonly conducted using local application of [[silver nitrate]] compound to any visible bleeding vessel. This is a painful procedure and the nasal mucosa should be anaesthetised first, preferably with the addition of topical adrenaline to further reduce bleeding. If bleeding is still uncontrolled or no focal bleeding point is visible then the nasal cavity should be packed with a sterile dressing, which by applying pressure to the nasal mucosa will tamponade the bleeding point. Ongoing bleeding despite good nasal packing is a surgical emergency and can be treated by endoscopic evaluation of the nasal cavity under general anaesthesia to identify an elusive bleeding point or to directly ligate (tie off) the blood vessels supplying the nose. These blood vessels include the [[sphenopalatine artery|sphenopalatine]], anterior and posterior [[ethmoidal]] arteries. More rarely the maxillary or a branch of the external [[Common carotid artery|carotid artery]] can be ligated. The bleeding can also be stopped by intra-arterial [[embolization]] using a catheter placed in the groin and threaded up the aorta to the bleeding vessel by an interventional radiologist. Continued bleeding may be an indication of more serious underlying conditions.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003106.htm MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Nosebleed] [[U.S.]] [[National Library of Medicine]] [[Medline Plus]] service.

===Prevention===
Application of a topical [[antibiotic]] ointment to the nasal mucosa has been shown to be an effective treatment for recurrent epistaxis.<ref name="pmid11843924">{{cite journal |author=Kubba H, MacAndie C, Botma M, Robison J, O'Donnell M, Robertson G, Geddes N |title=A prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial of antiseptic cream for recurrent epistaxis in childhood |journal=Clin Otolaryngol Allied Sci |volume=26|issue=6 |pages=465–8 |year=2001 |pmid= 11843924|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2273.2001.00502.x}}</ref> One study found it to be as effective as nasal cautery in the prevention of recurrent epistaxis in patients without active bleeding at the time of treatment - both had a success rate of approximately 50 percent.<ref name="pmid10384851">{{cite journal |author=Murthy P, Nilssen EL, Rao S, McClymont LG |title=A randomised clinical trial of antiseptic nasal carrier cream and silver nitrate cautery in the treatment of recurrent anterior epistaxis |journal=Clin Otolaryngol Allied Sci |volume=24|issue=3 |pages=228–31 |year=1999 |pmid= 10384851|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2273.1999.00236.x}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Nosebleeds are rarely dangerous unless prolonged and heavy. However, in posterior bleeds, a great deal of blood may be swallowed and therefore the amount of blood lost can be underestimated.  Recurrent nosebleeds may cause [[anemia]] due to [[iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]].

==Society and culture==
In the visual language of Japanese comics ([[manga]]) and animation ([[anime]]), a sudden, violent nosebleed indicates  that the bleeding person is sexually aroused.<ref name=Metroactive>{{cite news|title=Manga: The Complete Guide, reviewed by Richard von Busack|url=http://www.metroactive.com/metro/01.16.08/books-manga-0803.html|accessdate=5 August 2011|newspaper=[[Metroactive]]}}</ref><ref name="Sydney Morning Herald">{{cite news|last=Morgan|first=Joyce|title=Superheroes for a complex world|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/superheroes-for-a-complex-world/2007/02/08/1170524225116.html|accessdate=5 August 2011|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=February 10, 2007}}</ref> This is based on a Japanese folk belief according to which nosebleeds are signs of sexual excitement.<ref name=ANN>{{cite news|title=Anime Physics: Nosebleeds|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2010-07-17/anime-physics/nosebleeds|accessdate=5 August 2011|newspaper=[[Anime News Network]]|date=17 July 2010}}</ref> (Interestingly, the nose is now known to contain erectile tissue which may become engorged during sexual arousal: [[honeymoon rhinitis]] is a condition in which nasal stuffiness or sneezing accompanies sexual thoughts or activities.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7792102.stm Sneezing 'can be sign of arousal']</ref>)

In American usage, the [[nosebleed section]] or nosebleed seats are common slang for seating at sporting or other spectator events that are the highest up and farthest away from the desired event to be seen. The reference alludes to the propensity for nasal hemorrhage at high altitudes, usually owing to lower barometric pressure. Rarely, the term might be used to reference areas in clubs where [[mosh pit]]s happen frequently, as the violence of mosh pits is known to cause various blunt force traumas, including nosebleeds{{fact|date=March 2013}}.

In [[Finnish language]], "begging for a nosebleed" is commonly used in abstract meaning to describe self-destructive behaviour, for example ignoring safety procedures or deliberately aggravating stronger parties.<ref>http://saaressa.blogspot.fr/2011/01/finnsh-idioms.html</ref>
