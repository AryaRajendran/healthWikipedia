The '''Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate''' (SGR) is a method currently used by the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) in the United States to control spending by [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] on physician services.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SustainableGRatesConFact/ |title=Sustainable Growth Rates & Conversion Factors |publisher=CMS |accessdate=March 2, 2010}}</ref>  Enacted by the [[Balanced Budget Act of 1997]] to amend Section 1848(f) of the [[Social Security Act]], the SGR replaced the ''Medicare Volume Performance Standard'' (MVPS), which was the previous method that CMS used in an attempt to control costs.<ref name="sgr2010">{{cite web| url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SustainableGRatesConFact/Downloads/sgr2010f.pdf |title=Sustainable Growth Rates & Conversion Factors |publisher=CMS |accessdate=March 2, 2010}}</ref>  Generally, this is a method to ensure that the yearly increase in the expense per Medicare beneficiary does not exceed the growth in GDP.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jacob Goldstein |title=Why Medicare Pay Cuts for Doctors Will Be Back |date=July 10, 2008 |publisher=Wall Street Journal Health Blog |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2008/07/10/why-medicare-pay-cuts-for-doctors-will-be-back/}}</ref> Every year, the CMS sends a report to the [[Medicare Payment Advisory Commission]], which advises the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] on the previous year's total expenditures and the target expenditures.  The report also includes a conversion factor that will change the payments for physician services for the next year in order to match the target SGR.  If the expenditures for the previous year exceeded the target expenditures, then the conversion factor will decrease payments for the next year.  If the expenditures were less than expected, the conversion factor would increase the payments to physicians for the next year.  On March 1 of each year, the physician fee schedule is updated accordingly.  The implementation of the physician fee schedule update to meet the target SGR can be suspended or adjusted by Congress, as has been done regularly in the past (a '''doc fix''').<ref>Ezra Klein (June 26, 2010). "[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/06/what_to_do_about_the_doc_fix.html What to do about the doc fix?]" ''The Washington Post'' Accessed July 27, 2011.</ref>  Physician groups, including the [[American Medical Association]], lobby for a permanent reform to the SGR so that physician payment rates are not subject to annual cuts (a '''permanent doc fix''').

==Formula==
Section 1848(f)2 of the Social Security Act specifies the formula for calculating the SGR.<ref name="sgr2010"/>  There are four factors used in calculating the SGR:
#The estimated percentage change in fees for physicians’ services.
#The estimated percentage change in the average number of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries.
#The estimated 10-year average annual percentage change in real GDP per capita.
#The estimated percentage change in expenditures due to changes in law or regulations.

Prior to the enactment of the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] (MMA), the SGR was calculated using a single year's real [[GDP per capita]].  Since the MMA was enacted in 2003, the SGR is calculated using a 10-year annual average growth in real GDP per capita.

==Conversion factor==
In order to meet the target SGR for the next calendar year, the physician fee schedule is updated accordingly.  The update is calculated using two factors:
#One plus the Medicare Economic Index (MEI)
#One plus the Update Adjustment Factor (UAF)

The MEI measures the weighted average price change for various inputs involved with producing physicians’ services.<ref name="sgr2010"/> The UAF compares actual and target expenditures, and is determined by a formula that includes the target and actual expenditures and the SGR.  By law, the UAF can not exceed -7.0%.<ref name="sgr2010"/>

===Past adjustments===
====2000 - 2009 adjustments====
Section 101 of the [[Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006]] (MIEA-TRHCA) provided a 1-year update of 0% for the conversion factor for CY 2007 and specified that the conversion factor for CY 2008 must be computed as if the 1-year update had never applied. Section 101 of the [[Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007]] (MMSEA) provided a 6-month increase of 0.5% in the CY 2008 conversion factor, from January 1, 2008, through June 30, 2008, and specified that the conversion factor for the remaining portion of 2008 and the conversion factors for CY 2009 and subsequent years must be computed as if the 6-month increase had never applied. Section 131 of the [[Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008]] (MIPPA) extended the increase in the CY 2008 conversion factor that was applicable for the first half of the year to the entire year, provided for a 1.1%  increase to the CY 2009 conversion factor, and specified that the conversion factors for CY 2010 and subsequent years must be computed as if the increases had never applied.<ref name="sgr2010"/>

====2010 - 2013 adjustments====
The estimated SGR to go into effect on March 1, 2010 was -8.8%, and the conversion factor for the physician fee schedule was -21.3%.<ref name="sgr2010"/>  On March 3, 2010, Congress delayed the enforcement of the conversion factor until April 1, 2010 with the passage of the [[Temporary Extension Act of 2010]].<ref>{{citation |author=James Arvantes |newspaper=AAFP News Now |title=21.2 Percent Medicare Cut Averted: Senate Acts to Reverse Deep Reductions in Physician Payments  |url=http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/publications/news/news-now/government-medicine/20100303sgr-patch.html |date=March 3, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{citation |newspaper=Washington Independent |title=On Health Care Reform, a Major Step Remains: Newly Passed Bill Doesn't Address Medicare Payment Flaw |author=Mike Lillis  |url=http://washingtonindependent.com/80175/on-health-care-reform-a-major-step-remains |date=March 24, 2010}}</ref> On April 15, 2010, Congress enacted the [[Continuing Extension Act of 2010]] to again delay the implementation and extended the 2009 rate to June 1, 2010.<ref>{{citation |author=AMA |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/advocacy/current-topics-advocacy/practice-management/medicare-physician-payment-reform-regulatory-relief/federal-legislative-activities-medicare.shtml |date=May 18, 2010 |title=Medicare physician payment reform}}</ref>  On June 25, 2010, President Obama signed the [[Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010]] that not only delayed implementation of the conversion factor until December 1, 2010 but also increased reimbursements by 2.2%.<ref name="june2010">{{cite web | url=http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Daily-Reports/2010/June/25/Medicare-Pay-Fix.aspx |publisher=Kaiser Health News |title=Obama signs 6-month fix for medicare reimbursements to doctors |date=June 25, 2010 |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}</ref>  The 2.2% increase was retroactive to June 1, 2010, and expired on November 30, 2010.

When President Obama signed the [[Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012]] on February 22, 2012, the implementation of the conversion factor was again delayed until January 1, 2013, when the cut was estimated to be 27.4%.<ref>http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/stories/2011/december/15/faq-doc-fix.aspx</ref><ref>http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Daily-Reports/2012/February/17/sgr-doc-fix.aspx</ref><ref name="sgr2012">{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SustainableGRatesConFact/Downloads/sgr2012f.pdf |title=Sustainable Growth Rates & Conversion Factors |publisher=CMS |accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref>  Congress passed the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]] on January 1, 2013, which states in section 601 that the conversion factor for 2013 "shall be zero percent."<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Text 112th Congress (2011-2012) H.R.8.

==Previous MVPS/SGRs and conversion factors==
The table on the left is a table of past years' SGR.<ref name="sgr2013">{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SustainableGRatesConFact/Downloads/sgr2013f.pdf |title=Sustainable Growth Rates & Conversion Factors |publisher=CMS |accessdate=January 2, 2013}}</ref>  Prior to the MMA, the MVPS was in use instead of the SGR. The [[Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999]] (BBRA) changed the calculation from [[fiscal year]] (FY) to calendar year (CY).  The table on the right is a list of the actual yearly MEI and physician fee update conversion factor.  The physician update reflects a weighted average for FY 1991-1993 when there were two different updates (one for surgery and one for other services), and for FY 1994 through FY 1997 when there were three different updates (for surgery, primary care, and other services).<ref name="sgr2013"/>  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 consolidated service-specific updates so that starting in FY 1998, primary care, surgical, and nonsurgical services were updated by the same rate.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miriam J.
