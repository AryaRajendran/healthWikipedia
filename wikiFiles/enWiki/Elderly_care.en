'''Elderly care''', or simply '''eldercare''' (also known in parts of the English speaking world as '''aged care'''), is the fulfillment of the special needs and requirements that are unique to [[senior citizen]]s.  This broad term encompasses such services as [[assisted living]], [[Adult daycare center|adult day care]], [[Long-term care|long term care]], [[nursing home]]s, [[Hospice care|hospice]] care, and [[home care]]. Because of the wide variety of elderly care found globally, as well as differentiating cultural perspectives on elderly citizens, the subject cannot be limited to any one practice. For example, many countries in [[Asia]] use government-established elderly care quite infrequently, preferring the traditional methods of being cared for by younger generations of family members.  

Elderly care emphasizes the social and personal requirements of senior citizens who need some assistance with daily activities and health care, but who desire to age with dignity. It is an important distinction, in that the design of housing, services, activities, employee training and such should be truly customer-centered. It is also noteworthy that a large amount of global elderly care falls under the unpaid market sector.<ref>[http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_691.pdf "Unpaid and Paid Care: The Effects of Child Care and Elder Care on the Standard of Living," Kim et al. 2011]</ref>

==Cultural and geographic differences==
[[File:Nursing home corridor.JPG|thumb|Nurse at a [[nursing home]] in Norway]]
The form of elderly care provided varies greatly among countries and is changing rapidly.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/stable/4194376?seq=1 "The Elderly, Women's Work and Social Security Costs," Sundstrom, 1982]</ref> Even within the same country, regional differences exist with respect to the care for the elderly.<ref>[http://aseniorcompanionllc.com/senior-resources-elderly-care.html A Senior Companion, LLC 2009]</ref> However, it has been observed that the global elderly consume the most health expenditures out of any other age group,<ref>[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents "Health and Elderly Care Expenditure in an Aging World," 2000]</ref> an observation that shows worldwide eldercare may be very similar. We must also account for an increasingly large proportion of global elderly, especially in developing nations, as continued pressure is put on limiting fertility and decreasing family size.<ref name="World Population Aging">World Population Aging: [http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/WPA2009/WPA2009_WorkingPaper.pdf "World Population Aging, 2009"]</ref>

Traditionally, elderly care has been the responsibility of family members and was provided within the [[extended family]] home.<ref name="Elder care">Elder Care: [http://hkag.org/Publications/AJGG/V4N2/OA2009-62.pdf "Elder care: is legislation of family responsibility the solution?" Ting et al. 2009]</ref> Increasingly in modern societies, elderly care is now being provided by state or charitable institutions.<ref name="Elder care" /> The reasons for this change include decreasing family size, the greater [[life expectancy]] of elderly people, the geographical dispersion of families, and the tendency for women to be educated and work outside the home.<ref name="Elder care" />  Although these changes have affected European and North American countries first, they are now increasingly affecting Asian countries as well.<ref>Global Networks: Transnational mobilities for care: rethinking the dynamics of care in Asia, Huang et al. 2012</ref>

In most western countries, elderly care facilities are residential family care homes, freestanding [[assisted living]] facilities, [[nursing homes]], and [[Continuing care]] retirement communities (CCRCs).<ref>[Medical Care for the Elderly in Other Western Countries, Kane 2008]</ref> A family care home is a residential home with support and supervisory personnel by an agency, organization, or individual that provides room and board, personal care and habilitation services in a family environment for at least two and no more than six persons.<ref>[http://www.ptcog.org/aaa/area_providers/documents/AlamanceFCH.pdf "Family Care Homes," Piedmont Triad Council of Governments]</ref>

===Gender discrepancies in elderly care===

According to [[Family Caregiver Alliance]], the majority of family caregivers are women:<ref name="FCA">FCA: [http://www.caregiver.org/caregiver/jsp/content_node.jsp?nodeid=439 Family Caregiver Alliance]</ref> 

“Many studies have looked at the role of women and family caregiving.  Although not all have addressed gender issues and caregiving specifically, the results are still generalizable [sic] to women because they are the majority of informal care providers in this country. Consider:
•	Estimates of the percentage of family or informal caregivers who are women range from 59% to 75%.
•	The average caregiver is age 46, female, married and working outside the home earning an annual income of $35,000.
•	Although men also provide assistance, female caregivers may spend as much as 50% more time providing care than male caregivers."<ref name="FCA" />

===In developed nations===
====United States====
According to the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] the older population—persons 65 years or older—numbered 39.6 million in 2009.<ref name="Aging Statistics">[http://www.aoa.gov/aoaroot/aging_statistics/index.aspx Aging Statistics, U.S Department of Health and Human Services, June 2010]</ref> They represented 12.9 percent of the U.S. population, about one in every eight Americans.<ref name="Aging Statistics" /> By 2030, there will be about 72.1 million older persons, more than twice their number in 2000.<ref name="Aging Statistics" /> People 65-plus years old represented 12.4 percent of the population in the year 2000, but that is expected to grow to be 19 percent of the population by 2030.<ref name="Aging Statistics" /> This will mean more demand for elderly care facilities in the coming years. There were more than 36,000 assisted living facilities in the United States in 2009, according to the Assisted Living Federation of America <ref name="ALFA">ALFA: [http://www.alfa.org/alfa/default.asp Assisted Living Federation of America ]</ref> in 2009. More than 1 million senior citizens are served by these assisted living facilities.<ref name="ALFA" />

In the [[United States]], most of the large multi-facility providers are publicly owned and managed as for-profit businesses.<ref name="FCA" /> There are exceptions; the largest operator in the US is the Evangelical Lutheran Good Samaritan Society, a not-for-profit organization that manages 6,531 beds in 22 states, according to a 1995 study by the [[American Health Care Association]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Assessing the Financial Implications of Alternative Reimbursement Policies for Nursing Facilities|coauthors=The Moran Company|date=December 2011|publisher=American Health Care Association}}</ref>

Given the choice, most elders would prefer to continue to live in their own homes ([[aging in place]]).<ref name="Age in Place">{{cite web|title=What Is Aging In Place?|url=http://ageinplace.com/aging-in-place-basics/what-is-aging-in-place/|publisher=AgeInPlace.com}}</ref> Unfortunately, the majority of elderly people gradually lose functioning ability and require either additional assistance in the home or a move to an eldercare facility.<ref name="Age in Place" />  The adult children of these elders often face a difficult challenge in helping their parents make the right choices.<ref>{{cite news | first= Jane| last= Gross| coauthors= | title=Faced with Caregiving, Even the Experts Struggle | date=July 2008 | publisher= | url =http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/14/faced-with-caregiving-even-experts-struggle/ | work =New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2008-07-26 | language = }}</ref>  Assisted living is recommended for the elderly who need assistance with everyday tasks, and costs less than [[home care]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/assistedliving.html|title=Assisted Living|publisher=MedLine Plus|accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref> however, home care services may allow seniors to live in their own home for a longer period of time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gericarefinder.com/blog/senior-care|title=Senior Care|publisher=GeriCareFinder|accessdate=27 September 2012}}</ref>  

One relatively new service in the United States that can help keep the elderly in their homes longer is [[respite care]].<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Caregivers Catch a Break with Respite Care | date=September 2008 | publisher= | url =http://www.bestassistedliving.com/assistedliving-advice/Advice_and_Help/Care_Givers_Catch_a_Break_with_Respite_Care.html| work =BestAssistedLiving.com | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-01 | language = }}</ref> This type of care allows caregivers the opportunity to go on vacation or a business trip and know that their elder has good quality temporary care, for without this help the elder might have to move permanently to an outside facility. Another unique type of care cropping in U.S. hospitals is called acute care of elder units, or ACE units, which provide "a homelike setting" within a medical center specifically for the elderly.<ref>[http://www.sfghf.net/programs/ace_project.html Acute Care for Elders Project, 2011]</ref>

Some United States companies, like Senior Helpers, [[Home Instead Senior Care]], Help Find Care, FirstLight Home Care, Home Helpers, Professional HealthCare At Home, Visiting Angels, All Valley Home Care, Home Care Assistance, Medi Home Private Care, Concerning Aging<ref>[http://www.ConcerningAging.com Concerning Aging 2011]</ref> and Comfort Keepers, offer long-term, in-home care for seniors. 

Information about long term care options in the United States can be found by contacting the local [http://www.eldercare.gov Area Agency on Aging] or elder referral agencies such as [[Silver Living]], or [[A Place for Mom]].  Furthermore, the U.S. government recommends evaluation of health care facilities through websites using data collected from sources such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.gov/topics/health/caregivers/health-care-facility.shtml|title=Tips for Choosing a Health Care Facility|publisher=USA.gov|accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref>

====Canada====
In [[Canada]], such privately run for-profit facilities also exist, but they must compete with government-funded public facilities run by each province's or territory's Ministry of Health. In these care homes, elderly Canadians pay for their care on a sliding scale based on annual income. The scale that they are charged on depends on whether they utilize “Long Term Care” or “Assisted Living.” For example, commencing in January 2010 seniors living in British Columbia’s government subsidized “Long Term Care” (also called “Residential Care”) will pay 80% of their after tax income unless their After Tax Income is less than $16,500. The “Assisted Living” tariff is calculated more simply as 70% of the After Tax Income.<ref>Elder Care BC, "[http://www.eldercarebc.com/assisted-living-vs-long-term-care Assisted Living Vs Long Term Care]", ElderCareBC.com</ref>

====Australia====
[[File:ABS-6291.0.55.003-LabourForceAustraliaDetailedQuarterly-EmployedPersonsByIndustrySubdivisionSex-EmployedTotal-ResidentialCareServices-Persons-A2545766W.svg|thumb|right|Total employment in residential care services in Australia (thousands of people) since 1984]]
Aged care in Australia is designed to make sure that every Australian can contribute as much as possible toward their cost of care, depending on their individual income and assets. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agedcareaustralia.gov.au/internet/agedcare/publishing.nsf/Content/What%20will%20I%20pay |title=Department of Health and Ageing- Aged care Australia |accessdate=2010-11-22}} {{Dead link|date=November 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  This means that residents pay only what they can afford, and the Commonwealth government pays what a resident cannot. An Australian [[statutory authority]], the [[Productivity Commission]], conducted a review of aged care commencing in 2010 and reporting in 2011. That review concluded that approximately 80 percent of care for older Australians is informal care provided by family, friends and neighbours. Around a million people received government-subsidised aged care services, most of these receiving low-level community care support, with 160 000 people in permanent residential care. Expenditure on aged care by all governments in 2009-10 was approximately $11 billion. <ref name="PCoverview">{{cite book|last=Productivity Commission|title=Caring for Older Australians: Overview|publisher=Productivity Commission|location=Canberra|date=2011|url=http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/110932/aged-care-overview-booklet.pdf}}</ref>

The need for increasing amounts of care, and known weakneses in the care system (such as skilled workforce shortages and rationing of available care places), led several reviews in the 2000s to conclude that Australia's aged care system needs reform. This culminated in the 2011 Productivity Commission report and subsequent reform proposals.<ref name="PCoverview"/>
Aged Care recipients in Australia are subject to rebates and assistance from the Australian Federal Government provided they are assessed by an Aged Care Assessor (ACAT). Their care can fall into a number of categories including high care, low care and veterans home care.

===In developing nations===
====Nepal====
Due to health and economic benefits, the life expectancy in Nepal jumped from 27 years in 1951 to 65 in 2008.<ref name="Elderly People in Nepal">Nepal: [http://www.globalaging.org/health/world/2010/nepal.pdf+elderly+in+nepal&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiwlP3_-O92CzH-f2c_LuUUdBB_Q0RjIaDGx7dL_BouJRQFx5gmmi9oe9HDSp0WMpfuhzhoBnSjjZjl1TAEa5pdCrc-Ms5t3zIvJqKeaIGQbIJqBLO1imggssgbfIf2JoEJXvII&sig=AHIEtbRUUGEpP7zry8zviVCHheV6wIDYSQ "Status Report on Elderly People in Nepal," 2010]</ref> Most elderly Nepali citizens, roughly 85 percent, live in rural areas.<ref name="Elderly People in Nepal" /> Because of this, there is a significant lack of government sponsored programs or homes for the elderly. Traditionally, parents live with their children, and today, it is estimated that 80 percent of the elderly do.<ref name="Elderly People in Nepal" /> This number is changing as more children leave home for work or school, leading to loneliness or mental problems in Nepali elderly.<ref name="Elderly People in Nepal" /> 

The Ninth [[Five-Year Plans of Nepal|Five-Year Plan]] included policies in an attempt to care for the elderly left without children as caretakers.<ref name="Elderly People in Nepal" /> A Senior Health Facilities Fund has been established in each district.<ref name="Elderly People in Nepal" /> The Senior Citizens Health Facilities Program Implementation Guideline, 2061BS provides medical facilities to the elderly, and to those that are poverty stricken, free medicine and health care in all districts.<ref name="Elderly People in Nepal" /> In its yearly budget, the government has planned to fund free health care to all heart and kidney patients older than 75.<ref name="Elderly People in Nepal" /> Unfortunately, many of these plans are overly ambitious, which has been recognized by the Nepali government.<ref name="Elderly People in Nepal" /> Nepal is a developing nation and may not be able to fund all of these programs after the development of [[Old-Age-Allowance]], or OAA. OAA provides a monthly stipend to all citizens over 70 and widows over 60.<ref name="Elderly People in Nepal" />

Several charitable organizations have since opened in Nepal, with roughly 1500 elderly citizens living in them.<ref name="Elderly People in Nepal" /> Most of these are not government sponsored and are volunteer staffed.

====Thailand====
Thailand has observed global pattern of an enlarging elderly class: as fertility control is encouraged and medical advances are made, births shrink and lives age.<ref name="World Population Aging" /> The Thai government is noticing and concerned about this trend, but tends to let families care for their elderly members rather than create extraneous policies for them.<ref name="Thailand">Thailand: [http://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/pubs/pdf/rr11-732.pdf Intergenerational Family Care for and by Older People in Thailand, 2011]</ref> As of 2011, there are only 25 state sponsored homes for the elderly, with no more than a few thousand members of each home.<ref name="Thailand" /> Such programs are largely run by volunteers and are questionable on the basis of quality of care, considering there is not always a guarantee care will be available. Private care is very difficult to follow, often based on assumptions. Because children are less likely to care for their parents, private caretakers are in demand.<ref name="Thailand" /> Volunteer NGOs are available but in very limited quantities.<ref name="Thailand" />

While there are certainly programs available for use by the elderly in Thailand, questions of equity have risen since their introduction.<ref name="Thai Aging">Thai Aging: [http://iussp2009.princeton.edu/download.aspx?submissionId=91381 Health Equity in Thai Aging, Khananurak]</ref> The rich elderly in Thailand are much more likely to have access to care resources, while the poor elderly are more likely to actually use their acquired health care, as observed in a study by Bhumisuk Khananurak.<ref name="Thai Aging" /> However, over 96 percent of the nation has health insurance with varying degrees of care available.<ref name="Thai Aging" />

====India====
India's cultural view of elderly care is similar to that of Nepal's. Parents are typically cared for by their children into old age, most commonly by their sons.<ref>[http://ihds.umd.edu/IHDS_files/09HDinIndia.pdf Desai, Sonalde, Amaresh Dubey, B.L. Joshi, Mitali Sen, Abusaleh Shariff and Reeve Vanneman.  2010. India Human Development in India: Challenges for a Society in Transition.  New Delhi: Oxford University Press.]</ref><ref name="India elderly" /> It should be noted that in these countries, elderly citizens, especially men, are viewed in very high regard. Traditional values demand honor and respect for older, wiser people.<ref name="India elderly">India: [http://www.iussp.org/Brazil2001/s50/S55_P04_Sivamurthy.pdf+elderly+care+in+india&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiQvNzkWPYt-wkk7MCqkJfjT2WMEf_L36OZr6vsgBySBQkCeMBZQk5-z2yDUmZwTC334VzaUBmb1kmH_koLlFXiqivNz92AGU4ql6HUKF0M2zUdT3nbIKKtRkWnX8qARP4YLuDO&sig=AHIEtbT3w5vie02K8aTpDqBuUDbj-WKFNA Care and Support for the Elderly in India]</ref> India is facing the same problem as many developing nations in that its elderly population is increasing tremendously, with a current estimate of 90 million over the age of 60.<ref name="HelpAge">HelpAge: [http://www.helpageindia.org/about-us.php HelpAge India, 2009]</ref>  Using data on health and living conditions from the India's 60th National Sample Survey, a study found that almost a quarter of the elderly reported poor health. Reports of poor health were clustered among the poor, single, lower-educated and economically inactive groups.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sumit|first=Mazumdar|coauthors=Ulf-Goran Gerdtham|title=Heterogeneity in Self-Assessed Health Status Among the Elderly in India|journal=Asia-Pacific Journal of Public Health|date=13|year=2011|month=September|doi=10.1177/1010539511416109|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/heterogeneity-in-self-assessed-health-status-among-the-elder.html|accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref>    

Under its eleventh [[Five-Year Plans of India|Five-Year plan]], the Indian government has made many strides similar to that of Nepal. Article 41 of the [[Indian Constitution]] states that elderly citizens will be guaranteed Social Security support for health care and welfare.<ref name="HelpAge" /> A section of the 1973 Criminal Procedure Code, alluding to its traditional background, mandates that children support their parents if they no longer can themselves.<ref name="HelpAge" /> NGOs, however, are prevalent in Indian elderly care, providing homes and volunteer care, but governmental policies and organizations are more popular.<ref name="HelpAge" />

==Medical (skilled care) versus non-medical (social care)==

A distinction is generally made between [[medical care|medical]] and non-medical care, care provided by people who are not medical professionals. The latter is much less likely to be covered by insurance or public funds.  In the US, 67 percent of the one million or so residents in assisted living facilities pay for care out of their own funds.<ref>[http://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/post-import/fs62r_assisted.pdf AARP Assisted Living in the US, 2000]</ref> The rest get help from family and friends and from state agencies. [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] does not pay unless skilled-nursing care is needed and given in certified skilled nursing facilities or by a skilled nursing agency in the home. Assisted living facilities usually do not meet Medicare's requirements. However, Medicare does pay for some skilled care if the elderly person meets the requirements for the [[Home care|Medicare home health benefit]].
<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=How to Pay for Senior Care | date=August 2008 | publisher= | url =http://www.vidaseniorresource.com/pay.php| work =VidaSeniorResource.com | pages = | accessdate = 2009-03-30 | language = }}</ref>

Thirty-two U.S. states pay for care in [[assisted living]] facilities through their [[Medicaid]] waiver programs.  Similarly, in the [[United Kingdom]] the [[National Health Service]] provides medical care for the elderly, as for all, free at the point of use, but social care is only paid for by the state in Scotland; England, Wales and Northern Ireland are yet to introduce any legislation on the matter, so currently social care is only funded by public authorities when a person has exhausted their private resources, for example, by selling their home.

However, elderly care is focused on satisfying the expectations of two tiers of customers: the resident customer and the purchasing customer, who are often not identical, since relatives or public authorities rather than the resident may be providing the cost of care.  Where residents are confused or have communication difficulties, it may be very difficult for relatives or other concerned parties to be sure of the standard of care being given, and the possibility of [[elder abuse]] is a continuing source of concern. The Adult Protective Services Agency — a component of the human service agency in most states — is typically responsible for investigating reports of domestic elder abuse and providing families with help and guidance. Other professionals who may be able to help include doctors or nurses, police officers, lawyers, and social workers.<ref>Maria M. Meyer and Paul Derr, "What to Do When You Suspect Elder Abuse," ''Caring.com, Senior Care and Elder Care'', December 2008</ref>

==Promoting independence in the elderly==

Promoting independence in self-care can provide older adults with the capability to maintain independence longer and can leave them with a sense of achievement when they complete a task unaided [36]. Older adults that require assistance with activities of daily living are at a greater risk of losing their independence with self-care tasks as dependent personal behaviours are often met with reinforcement from caregivers [37]. It is important for caregivers to ensure that measures are put into place to preserve and promote function rather than contribute to a decline in status in an older adult that has physical limitations. Caregivers need to be conscious of actions and behaviors that cause older adults to become dependent on them and need to allow older patients to maintain as much independence as possible. Providing information to the older patient on why it is important to perform self-care may allow them to see the benefit in performing self-care independently. If the older adult is able to complete self-care activities on their own, or even if they need supervision, encourage them in their efforts as maintaining independence can provide them with a sense of accomplishment and the ability to maintain independence longer [36].

==Improving mobility in the elderly==

Impaired mobility is a major health concern for older adults, affecting fifty percent of people over 85 and at least a quarter of those over 75.  As adults lose the ability to walk, to climb stairs, and to rise from a chair, they become completely disabled. The problem cannot be ignored because people over 65 constitute the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population.

Therapy designed to improve mobility in elderly patients is usually built around diagnosing and treating specific impairments, such as reduced strength or poor balance.  It is appropriate to compare older adults seeking to improve their mobility to athletes seeking to improve their split times.  People in both groups perform best when they measure their progress and work toward specific goals related to strength, [[aerobic capacity]], and other physical qualities.  Someone attempting to improve an older adult’s mobility must decide what impairments to focus on, and in many cases, there is little scientific evidence to justify any of the options.  Today, many caregivers choose to focus on leg strength and balance.  New research suggests that limb [[velocity]] and [[core strength]] may also be important factors in mobility.<ref>Bean, Jonathan. “Three Big Risks For Older Adults: Walking, Climbing Stairs and Rising from a Chair - Evidence-based Rehabilitative Care for Older Adults.” CIMIT Forum. November 6, 2007.</ref>

The family is one of the most important providers for the elderly.  In fact, the majority of caregivers for the elderly are often members of their own family, most often a daughter or a granddaughter.  Family and friends can provide a home (i.e. have elderly relatives live with them), help with money and meet social needs by visiting, taking them out on trips, etc.

One of the major causes of elderly falls is hyponatremia, an electrolyte disturbance when the level of sodium in a person's serum drops below 135 mEq/L. Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the elderly patient population. Studies have shown that older patients are more prone to hyponatremia as a result of multiple factors including physiologic changes associated with aging such as decreases in glomerular filtration rate, a tendency for defective sodium conservation, and increased vasopressin activity. Mild hyponatremia ups the risk of fracture in elderly patients because hyponatremia has been shown to cause subtle neurologic impairment that affects gait and attention, similar to that of moderate alcohol intake.<ref>Sandhu, Harminder S. et al. "Hyponatremia associated with large-bone fracture in elderly patients." Int Urol Nephrol (2009) 41:733-737,</ref>

===Legal issues about incapacity===

Legal incapacity is an invasive and sometimes, difficult legal procedure.  It requires that a person file a petition with the local courts, stating the elderly person lacks the [[capacity (law)|capacity]] to carry out activities that include making medical decisions, voting, making gifts, seeking public benefits, marrying, managing property and financial affairs, choosing where to live and who they socialize with. Most states' laws require that a minimum of two doctors or other health professionals, provide reports as evidence of such incompetence and the person must be represented by an attorney.  Only then can the individual's legal rights be removed and legal supervision by a guardian or conservator be initiated.  The [[legal guardian]] or conservator is the person to whom the court delegates the responsibility of acting on the incapacitated person's behalf and must report regularly his or her activities to the court. 

A less restrictive alternative to legal incapacity is the use of "Advance Directives"; 
powers of attorney, [[trusts]], [[living wills]] and health care directives.  The person who has these documents in place, should have prepared them with their attorney when that person had capacity.  So, if the time comes when that person lacks capacity to carry out those tasks laid out in the documents, the person they named (their agent) can step in to make decisions on their behalf.  The agent has a duty to act as that person would have and in their best interest.
