'''Blood sugar regulation''' is the process by which the levels of [[blood sugar]], primarily [[glucose]], are maintained by the body.

==Mechanisms of blood sugar regulation==

Blood sugar levels are regulated by [[negative feedback]] in order to keep the body in [[homeostasis]].  The levels of [[glucose]] in the blood are monitored by the cells in the [[pancreas]]'s [[Islets of Langerhans]].  If the blood glucose level falls to dangerous levels (as in very heavy exercise or lack of food for extended periods), the [[Alpha cells]] of the pancreas release [[glucagon]], a [[hormone]] whose effects on liver cells act to increase blood glucose levels. They  convert [[glycogen]] into glucose (this process is called [[glycogenolysis]]).  The glucose is released into the bloodstream, increasing blood sugar levels.

When levels of blood sugar rise, whether as a result of [[glycogen]] conversion, or from digestion of a meal, a different hormone is released from [[beta cells]] found in the [[Islets of Langerhans]] in the pancreas. This hormone, [[insulin]], causes the liver to convert more glucose into glycogen (this process is called [[glycogenesis]]), and to force about 2/3 of body cells (primarily [[muscle]] and fat tissue cells) to take up glucose from the blood through the [[GLUT4]] transporter, thus decreasing blood sugar. When insulin binds to the receptors on the cell surface, vesicles containing the GLUT4 transporters come to the plasma membrane and fuse together by the process of exocytosis, thus enabling a facilitated diffusion of glucose into the cell. As soon as the glucose enters the cell, it is phosphorylated into Glucose-6-Phosphate in order to preserve the concentration gradient so glucose will continue to enter the cell.<ref>Ebey Soman, [[Scienceray]], [http://scienceray.com/biology/human-biology/regulation-of-glucose-by-insulin Regulation of Glucose by Insulin], May 4, 2009. Retrieved November 1, 2009.</ref> Insulin also provides signals to several other body systems, and is the chief regulatory metabolic control in humans.  

There are also several other causes for an increase in blood sugar levels. Among them are the 'stress' hormones such as epinephrine (also known as adrenaline), several of the steroids, infections, trauma, and of course, the ingestion of food.

[[Diabetes mellitus]] type 1 is caused by insufficient or non-existent production of insulin, while type 2 is primarily due to a decreased response to insulin in the tissues of the body ([[insulin resistance]]). Both types of diabetes, if untreated, result in too much glucose remaining in the blood ([[hyperglycemia]]) and many of the same complications.  Also, too much insulin and/or exercise without enough corresponding food intake in diabetics can result in low blood sugar ([[hypoglycemia]]).
