'''Aripiprazole''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|ɛər|ɨ|ˈ|p|ɪ|p|r|ə|z|oʊ|l}} {{respell|AIR|i|PIP|rə-zohl}}; brand names: '''Abilify''', '''Aripiprex''') is a partial [[dopamine agonist]] of the second generation class of [[atypical antipsychotic]]s with additional [[antidepressant]] properties that is used in the treatment of [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar disorder]], and [[clinical depression]]. It was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for schizophrenia on November 15, 2002 and the [[European Medicines Agency]] on 4 June 2004; for acute [[mania|manic]] and [[mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed episodes]] associated with bipolar disorder on October 1, 2004; as an adjunct for [[major depressive disorder]] on November 20, 2007; and to treat irritability in children with autism on 20 November 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/depression/news/20071120/fda-oks-abilify-for-depression |title=FDA OKs Abilify for Depression |accessdate=8 December 2008 |last=Hitti |first=Miranda |publisher=WebMD |date=20 November 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081205110249/http://www.webmd.com/depression/news/20071120/fda-oks-abilify-for-depression| archivedate= 5 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2023065120091121/ |title=FDA OKs Abilify for child autism irritability |accessdate=22 September 2010 |last=Keating |first=Gina |publisher=Reuters |date=23 November 2009}}</ref> Aripiprazole was developed by [[Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co.|Otsuka]] in [[Japan]], and in the [[United States]], [[Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co.|Otsuka America]] markets it jointly with [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]].

== Medical uses ==
Aripiprazole is used for the treatment of [[schizophrenia]] or [[bipolar disorder]].<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=abilify|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/abilify.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

In the [[United States]], the FDA has approved aripiprazole for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and adolescents (aged 13–17), of [[Manic episode#Signs and symptoms|manic]] and [[Mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed episodes]] associated with [[Bipolar I Disorder]] with or without psychotic features in adults, children and adolescents (aged 10–17),<ref>{{cite web | url = http://psychcentral.com/news/2008/05/09/abilify-receives-approval-for-expanded-use-in-children-teens/2261.html | title = Abilify Receives Approval for Expanded Use in Children, Teens | publisher = Psych Central | accessdate = 2012-07-16}}</ref> of irritability associated with [[autism]] in pediatric patients (aged 6–17),<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.furiousseasons.com/archives/2009/11/abilify_gets_fda_approval_for_autism_irritability.html | title = Abilify Gets FDA Approval For Autism Irritability | publisher = Furious Seasons | accessdate = 2012-07-16}}</ref> and of depression when used along with antidepressants in adults.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.webmd.com/depression/news/20071120/fda-oks-abilify-for-depression | title = FDA OKs Abilify for Depression : Antipsychotic Drug Approved for Use in Addition to Antidepressants for Treating Depression | publisher = WebMD | accessdate = 2012-07-16}}</ref>

Aripiprazole is also used [[off-label]] for schizophrenia in children (aged 10–12), and to treat dementia-related psychosis in geriatric patients, though Bristol-Myers Squibb was penalized for promoting such uses in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2007/September/07_civ_782.html | title = Bristol-Myers Squibb to Pay More Than $515 Million to Resolve Allegations of Illegal Drug Marketing and Pricing | publisher = US Department of Justice | accessdate = 2012-07-16}}</ref>

===Major depression===
In 2007, aripiprazole was approved by the FDA for the treatment of [[unipolar depression]] when used adjunctively with an antidepressant medication.<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2008/021436s21,021713s16,021729s8,021866s8lbl.pdf Section 2.3 pp 7-8</ref> It has not been FDA-approved for use as monotherapy in unipolar depression.

===Autism===
In 2009, the United States FDA approved aripiprazole to treat irritability in "children and adolescents ages 6 to 17 years old" who have been diagnosed with [[autism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/713006 |title=FDA Approves Aripiprazole to Treat Irritability in Autistic Children |author=Yael Waknine |date=24 November 2009 |work=Medscape Today |publisher=WebMD |accessdate=23 February 2010}}</ref> It was approved on the basis of two studies that showed it reduced aggression towards others, self-injury, quickly changing moods, and irritability.

===Cocaine dependency===
Perhaps owing to its mechanism of action relating to dopamine receptors, there is some evidence to suggest that aripiprazole blocks cocaine-seeking behavior in animal models without significantly affecting other rewarding behaviors (such as food self-administration).<ref>'Aripiprazole Blocks Reinstatement of Cocaine Seeking in an Animal Model of Relapse' Biological Psychiatry.  Volume 61, Issue 5, Pages 582-590 (1 March 2007) http://www.journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/bps/article/S0006-3223%2806%2900484-7/abstract</ref>

===Methamphetamine dependency===
The book ''Addiction Medicine'' mentions studies, suggesting aripiprazole would be counter-therapeutic as treatment for methamphetamine dependency because it increased methamphetamine's stimulant and euphoric effects, and increased the baseline level of desire for methamphetamine. The author mentions studies that suggest that dopamine agonist treatment would be counter-therapeutic for methamphetamine/amphetamine dependency.<ref>'Addiction Medicine:Science and Practice.

===Discontinuation===
Aripiprazole should be discontinued gradually, with careful consideration from the prescribing doctor, to avoid withdrawal symptoms or relapse.

The [[British National Formulary]] recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing anti-psychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=BMJ |editor1-last=Group |title=British National Formulary |edition=57 |year=2009 |month=March |publisher=Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain |location=United Kingdom |isbn=978-0-85369-845-6 |page=192 |chapter=4.2.1 |quote=Withdrawal of antipsychotic drugs after long-term therapy should always be gradual and closely monitored to avoid the risk of acute withdrawal syndromes or rapid relapse.}}</ref> Due to compensatory changes at dopamine, serotonin, adrenergic and histamine receptor sites in the central nervous system, withdrawal symptoms can occur during abrupt or over-rapid reduction in dosage. Withdrawal symptoms reported to occur after discontinuation of antipsychotics include nausea, [[emesis]], lightheadedness, [[diaphoresis]], [[dyskinesia]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], [[tachycardia]], nervousness, dizziness, headache, excessive non-stop crying, and [[anxiety]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = DR. | last2 = Staab | first2 = JP. | title = Quetiapine discontinuation syndrome | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/162/5/1020 | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 162 | issue = 5 | pages = 1020 | month = May | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.162.5.1020 | pmid = 15863814 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Michaelides | first1 = C. | last2 = Thakore-James | first2 = M. | last3 = Durso | first3 = R. | title = Reversible withdrawal dyskinesia associated with quetiapine | journal = Mov Disord | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 769–70 | month = Jun | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1002/mds.20427 | pmid = 15747370 }}</ref>  Some have argued that additional somatic and psychiatric symptoms associated with dopaminergic super-sensitivity, including dyskinesia and acute psychosis, are common features of withdrawal in individuals treated with neuroleptics.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Chouinard | first1 = G. | last2 = Jones | first2 = BD. | title = Neuroleptic-induced supersensitivity psychosis: clinical and pharmacologic characteristics | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=157922  |

===Overdosage===
Children or adults who ingested acute overdoses have usually manifested central nervous system depression ranging from mild sedation to coma; serum concentrations of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole in these patients were elevated by up to 3-4 fold over normal therapeutic levels, yet to date no deaths have been recorded.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 105-106.</ref>

=== Drug interactions ===
Aripiprazole is a substrate of [[CYP2D6]] and [[CYP3A4]]. Coadministration with medications that inhibit (e.g. [[paroxetine]], [[fluoxetine]]) or induce (e.g. [[carbamazepine]]) these metabolic enzymes are known to increase and decrease, respectively, plasma levels of aripiprazole.<ref name="drugLabelWP">{{cite web |url=http://www.druglib.com/druginfo/abilify/warnings_precautions/ |title=Abilify (Aripiprazole) - Warnings and Precautions |accessdate=8 December 2008 |publisher=DrugLib.com |date=14 February 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081204161824/http://www.druglib.com/druginfo/abilify/warnings_precautions/| archivedate= 4 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> As such, anyone taking aripiprazole should be aware that their dosage of aripiprazole may need to be decreased.

Aripiprazole's [[mechanism of action]] is different from those of the other FDA-approved [[atypical antipsychotic]]s (e.g., [[clozapine]], [[olanzapine]], [[quetiapine]], [[ziprasidone]], and [[risperidone]]).

Aripiprazole produces [[2,3-dichlorophenylpiperazine]] (DCPP) as a [[metabolite]] similarly to how [[trazodone]] and [[nefazodone]] reduce to [[meta-Chlorophenylpiperazine|3-chlorophenylpiperazine]] (''m''CPP) and [[niaprazine]] converts to [[para-Fluorophenylpiperazine|4-fluorophenylpiperazine]] (pFPP).<ref name="pmid17691920">{{cite journal | author = Caccia S | title = N-dealkylation of arylpiperazine derivatives: disposition and metabolism of the 1-aryl-piperazines formed | journal = Current Drug Metabolism | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 612–22 | year = 2007 | month = August | pmid = 17691920 | doi = 10.2174/138920007781368908| url = http://www.bentham-direct.org/pages/content.php?CDM/2007/00000008/00000006/0005F.SGM}}</ref> It is unknown whether DCPP contributes to aripiprazole's pharmacology.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Aripiprazole displays linear kinetics and has an elimination half-life of approximately 75 hours. Steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved in about 14 days. C<sub>max</sub> (maximum plasma concentration) is achieved 3–5 hours after oral dosing. [[Bioavailability]] of the oral tablets is about 90% and the drug undergoes extensive hepatic metabolization (dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation), principally by the enzymes [[CYP2D6]] and [[CYP3A4]]. Its only known active metabolite is dehydro-aripiprazole, which typically accumulates to approximately 40% of the aripiprazole concentration. The parenteral drug is excreted only in traces, and its metabolites, active or not, are excreted via feces and urine.<ref name="drugLabelPC">{{cite web |url=http://www.druglib.com/druginfo/abilify/pharmacology/ |title=Abilify (Aripiprazole) - Clinical Pharmacology |accessdate=8 December 2008 |publisher=DrugLib.com |date=14 February 2007 }}</ref> When dosed daily, brain concentrations of aripiprazole will increase for a period of 10–14 days, before reaching stable constant levels.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
