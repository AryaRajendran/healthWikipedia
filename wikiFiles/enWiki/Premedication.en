'''Premedication''' refer to a [[medication|drug]] treatment given to a patient before a (surgical or invasive) medical procedure. These drugs are typically [[sedative]] or [[analgesic]].

Premedication before [[chemotherapy]] for cancer often refers to special drug regimens (usually 2  or more drugs, e.g. [[dexamethasone]], [[diphenhydramine]] and [[omeprazole]]) given to a patient minutes to  hours  before the chemotherapy to avert side effects or  [[hypersensitivity]] reactions (i.e. allergic reactions).

[[Melatonin]] has been found to be effective as a premedication in both adults and children due to its pharmacological properties of [[hypnotic]], [[antinociceptive]] and [[anticonvulsant]] which produce effective anxiolosis and sedation. Unlike midazolam melatonin does not impair psychomotor skills or adversely affect the quality of recovery. It has a faster recovery time compared to midazolam and has a reduced incidence of post-operative excitement and results in a reduction in dose required of [[propofol]] and [[thiopental]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Naguib | first1 = M. | last2 = Gottumukkala | first2 = V. | last3 = Goldstein | first3 = PA. | title = Melatonin and anesthesia: a clinical perspective. | journal = J Pineal Res | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–21 | month = Jan | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-079X.2006.00384.x | pmid = 17198534 }}</ref>

[[Midazolam]] is effective in children in reducing anxiety associated with separation from parents and induction of [[anesthesia]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cox | first1 = RG. | last2 = Nemish | first2 = U. | last3 = Ewen | first3 = A. | last4 = Crowe | first4 = MJ. | title = Evidence-based clinical update: does premedication with oral midazolam lead to improved behavioural outcomes in children? | journal = Can J Anaesth | volume = 53 | issue = 12 | pages = 1213–9 | month = Dec | year = 2006 | doi =  10.1007/BF03021583| pmid = 17142656 }}</ref> [[Sufentanil]] is also sometimes used as a premedication. [[Clonidine]] is becoming increasingly popular as a premedication for children. One drawback of clonidine is that it can take up to 45 minutes to take full effect.<ref name="Rosenbaum-2009">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Rosenbaum | first1 = A. | last2 = Kain | first2 = ZN. | last3 = Larsson | first3 = P. | last4 = Lönnqvist | first4 = PA. | last5 = Wolf | first5 = AR. | title = The place of premedication in pediatric practice. | journal = Paediatr Anaesth | volume = 19 | issue = 9 | pages = 817–28 | month = Sep | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1111/j.1460-9592.2009.03114.x | pmid = 19691689 }}</ref> In children, clonidine has been found to be equal to and possibly superior to benzodiazepines as a premedication. It has a more favourable side effect profile. It also reduces the need for an [[General anesthesia#Induction|induction]] agent. It improves post-operative pain relief, is better at inducing sedation at induction, reduces [[agitated emergence]], reduces shivering and [[post-operative nausea and vomiting]] and reduces post-operative delirium associated with [[sevoflurane]] anaesthesia. [[Benzodiazepine]]s such as [[midazolam]] are more commonly used due largely to a lack of a marketing effort by the pharmaceutical companies. As a result clonidine is becoming increasingly popular with [[anesthesiologists]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bergendahl | first1 = H. | last2 = Lönnqvist | first2 = PA. | last3 = Eksborg | first3 = S. | title = Clonidine in paediatric anaesthesia: review of the literature and comparison with benzodiazepines for premedication. | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118557949/HTMLSTART | journal = Acta Anaesthesiol Scand | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–43 | month = Feb | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-6576.2006.00940.x | pmid = 16430532 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Dahmani | first1 = S. | last2 = Brasher | first2 = C. | last3 = Stany | first3 = I. | last4 = Golmard | first4 = J. | last5 = Skhiri | first5 = A. | last6 = Bruneau | first6 = B. | last7 = Nivoche | first7 = Y. | last8 = Constant | first8 = I. | last9 = Murat | first9 = I. | title = Premedication with clonidine is superior to benzodiazepines.
