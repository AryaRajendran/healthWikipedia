'''Door-to-balloon''' is a time measurement in emergency cardiac care (ECC), specifically in the treatment of [[myocardial infarction|ST segment elevation myocardial infarction]] (or STEMI). The interval starts with the patient's arrival in the [[emergency department]], and ends when a catheter guidewire crosses the culprit lesion in the [[cardiac catheterization|cardiac cath lab]]. Because of the adage that "time is muscle", meaning that delays in treating a myocardial infarction increase the likelihood and amount of [[cardiac muscle]] damage due to localised [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Soon CY, Chan WX, Tan HC |title=The impact of time-to-balloon on outcomes in patients undergoing modern primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction |journal=Singapore medical journal |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=131–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17304392 |doi=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Arntz HR, Bossaert L, Filippatos GS |title=European Resuscitation Council guidelines for resuscitation 2005.

Although incorporating a prehospital 12 lead ECG into critical pathways for STEMI patients is listed as an optional strategy by the D2B Alliance, the fastest median door-to-balloon times have been achieved by hospitals with paramedics who perform 12 lead ECGs in the field.<ref name="Bradley_JACC">{{cite journal |author=Bradley EH |title=Achieving door-to-balloon times that meet quality guidelines: how do successful hospitals do it? |journal=J.

==Common themes in hospitals achieving rapid door-to-balloon times==
Bradley et al. (Circulation 2006) performed a qualitative analysis of 11 hospitals in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction that had median door-to-balloon times = or < 90 minutes. They identified 8 themes that were present in all 11 hospitals:<ref name="Bradley_D2B"/>
# An explicit goal of reducing door-to-balloon times
# Visible support of senior management
# Innovative, standardized protocols
# Flexibility in implementing standardized protocols
# Uncompromising individual clinical leaders
# Collaborative interdisciplinary teams
# Data feedback to monitor progress and identify problems or successes
# Organizational culture that fostered persistence despite challenges and setbacks

==Criteria for an ideal primary PCI center==
Granger et al. (Circulation 2007) identified the following criteria of an ideal primary PCI center.<ref name=Granger_2007/>

===Institutional resources===
# Primary PCI is the routine treatment for eligible STEMI patients 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
# Primary PCI is performed as soon as possible
# Institution is capable of providing supportive care to STEMI patients and handling complications
# Written commitment by hospital administration to support the program
## Identifies physician director for PCI program
## Creates multidisciplinary group that includes input from all relevant stakeholders, including cardiology, emergency medicine, nursing, and EMS
# Institution designs and implements a continuing education program
# For institution without on-site surgical backup, there is a written agreement with tertiary institution and EMS to provide for rapid transfer of STEMI patients when needed

===Physician resources===
# Interventional cardiologists meet ACC/AHA criteria for competence
# Interventional cardiologists participate in, and are responsive to formal on-call schedule

===Program requirements===
# Minimum of 36 primary PCI procedures and 400 total PCI procedures annually
# Program is described in a "manual of operations" that is compliant with ACC/AHA guidelines
# Mechanisms for monitoring program performance and ongoing quality improvement activities

===Other features of ideal system===
# Robust data collection and feedback including door-to-balloon time, first door-to-balloon time (for transferred patients), and the proportion of eligible patients receiving some form of reperfusion therapy
# Earliest possible activation of the cardiac cath lab, based on prehospital ECG whenever possible, and direct referral to PCI-hospital based on field diagnosis of STEMI
# Standardized ED protocols for STEMI management
# Single phone call activation of cath lab that does not depend on cardiologist interpretation of ECG

==Gaps and barriers to timely access to primary PCI==
Granger et al. (Circulation 2007) identified the following barriers to timely access to primary PCI.<ref name=Granger_2007/>
# Busy PCI hospitals may have to divert patients
# Significant delays in ED diagnosis of STEMI may occur, particularly when patient does not arrive by EMS
# Manpower and financial considerations may prevent smaller PCI programs from providing primary PCI for STEMI 24 hours a day
# Reimbursement for optimal coordination of STEMI patients needs to be realigned to reflect performance
# In most PCI centers, cath lab staff is off-site during off hours, requiring a mandate that staff report with 20–30 minutes of cath lab activation
