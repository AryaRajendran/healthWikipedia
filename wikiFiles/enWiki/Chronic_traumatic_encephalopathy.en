'''Chronic traumatic encephalopathy''' ('''CTE''') is a form of [[encephalopathy]] that is a progressive [[degenerative disease]], which can only be definitively diagnosed ''[[postmortem]]'' in individuals with a history of multiple [[concussion]]s and other forms of [[head injury]]. The disease was previously called [[dementia pugilistica]] (DP), as it was initially found in those with a history of [[boxing]]. CTE has been most commonly found in professional athletes participating in [[American football]], [[ice hockey]], [[professional wrestling]] and other [[contact sport]]s who have experienced repetitive brain trauma. It has also been found in soldiers exposed to a blast or a concussive injury,<ref name="CTE"/> in both cases resulting in characteristic degeneration of brain tissue and the accumulation of [[tau protein]]. Individuals with CTE may show symptoms of [[dementia]], such as [[memory loss]], [[aggression]], confusion and [[depression (mood)|depression]], which generally appear years or many decades after the trauma.

Repeated concussions and injuries less serious than concussions ("sub-concussions") incurred during the play of contact sports over a long period can result in CTE. In the case of blast injury, a single exposure to a blast and the subsequent violent movement of the head in the blast wind can cause the condition.<ref name="CTE"/>

==Epidemiology==
CTE is a neurological degenerative disease found in individuals who have been subjected to repetitive traumatic brain injuries<ref name="pmid19535999" /> by way of the acceleration and deceleration of the head on impact and the subsequent damage to axons. While repetitive brain trauma is thought to be necessary to cause CTE, it is not sufficient, meaning that not everyone exposed to repetitive brain trauma will get the disease. Other risk factors are possible but have not yet been reported, due to the donated brains in the brain bank at the Boston University School of Medicine and elsewhere, which consists mostly of the brains of athletes with a history of professional participation in contact sports.<ref name="Saulle M and Greenwald B">{{cite journal |author=Saulle M and Greenwald B | title=Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy: A Review |journal=Rehabilitation Research and Practice | year: 2012 | Article ID: 816069.| doi:10.1155/2012/816069}}</ref> Professional level athletes are the largest demographic to suffer from CTE due to frequent concussions from play in [[contact-sport]].

==Pathology==
The primary physical manifestations of CTE include a reduction in brain weight, associated with atrophy of the frontal and temporal cortices and [[medial temporal lobe]]. The lateral ventricles and the third ventricle are often enlarged, with rare instances of dilation of the fourth ventricle.<ref name="Baugh C et al 2012 244–254">{{cite journal |author=Baugh C “et al” | title=Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy: Neurodegeneration following repetitive concussive and subconcussive brain trauma. |journal=Brain Imaging and Behavior |volume=6|pages=244–254|year=2012}}</ref> Other physical manifestations of CTE include pallor of the [[substantia nigra]] and locus ceruleus, and atrophy of the olfactory bulbs, thalamus, mammillary bodies, brainstem and cerebellum. As CTE progresses, there may be marked atrophy of the hippocampus, [[entorhinal cortex]], and [[amygdala]].<ref name="pmid19535999">{{cite journal |author=McKee AC, Cantu RC, Nowinski CJ, ''et al.'' |title=Chronic traumatic encephalopathy in athletes: progressive tauopathy after repetitive head injury |journal=J.

On a microscopic scale the pathology includes neuronal loss, [[tau deposition]],TAR DNA-binding Protein 43 (TDP 43)<ref name="McKee A et al 2012 1–22">{{cite journal |author=McKee A “et al” | title=The Spectrum of Disease in Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy |journal=Brain |pages=1–22 |year=2012}}</ref>  [[Beta amyloid|beta-amyloid]] deposition, [[white matter]] changes, and other abnormalities. The tau deposition occurs as dense [[neurofibrillary tangle]]s (NFT), [[neurites]], and glial tangles, which are made up of [[astrocytes]] and other glial cells<ref name="Baugh C et al 2012 244–254"/> Beta-amyloid deposition is relatively uncommon feature of CTE.

A small group of individuals with CTE have chronic traumatic encephalomyopathy (CTEM), characterized by motor neuron disease symptoms and mimics [[Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis]] (ALS) or [[Lou Gehrig’s disease]]. Progressive muscle weakness and balance and gait problems seem to be early signs of CTEM.<ref name="Baugh C et al 2012 244–254"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Other than repeated brain trauma, the risk factors for CTE remain unknown.<ref name="Baugh C et al 2012 244–254"/> So far, CTE can only be diagnosed posthumously. Research studies are looking into possible genetic, exposure level, and other risk factors.

Researchers who conducted a CTE pilot study at UCLA described the findings as a significant step toward being able to diagnose CTE, in living patients. <ref>http://www.espn.go.com/pdf/2013/0122/espn_otl_CTELiving.pdf</ref>

Clinical symptoms of CTE are only beginning to be understood. They are thought to include changes in mood(i.e. depression, suicidality, apathy, anxiety), cognition (i.e. memory loss, executive dysfunction), behavior (short fuse, aggression), and in some cases motor disturbance (i.e. difficulty with balance and gait). While the pathology of CTE has been broken up into stages <ref name="McKee A et al 2012 1–22">{{cite journal |author=McKee A “et al” | title=The Spectrum of Disease in Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy |journal=Brain |pages=1–22 |year=2012}}</ref> the clinical symptoms and clinical progression of CTE are not yet fully understood.

==Prevention==
No agreement has been reached about how much or little head trauma is needed for CTE to develop, or the overarching mechanism of injury.<ref name="Saulle M and Greenwald B"/> Recently, investigators demonstrated that immobilizing the head during a blast exposure prevented the learning and memory deficits associated with CTE that occurred when the head was not immobilized. This research, represents the first case series of postmortem brains from U.S. military personnel who were exposed to a blast and/or a concussive injury.

==Diagnosis==
The lack of [[in-vivo]] techniques to show distinct [[biomarker]]s for CTE is the reason for why CTE cannot be diagnosed during lifetime. The only known diagnosis for CTE occurs by studying the brain tissue after death. Concussions are non-structural injuries and do not result in brain bleeding, which is why most concussions cannot be seen on routine neuroimaging tests such as CT or MRI.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poirier MP |title=Concussions: Assessment, management, and recommendations for return to activity. |journal=Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine | volume=4|issue=3|pages=179–85|year=2003}}</ref> Acute concussion symptoms (those that occur shortly after an injury) should not be confused with CTE. Differentiating between prolonged post-concussion syndrome (PCS, where symptoms begin shortly after a concussion and last for weeks, months, and sometimes even years) and CTE symptoms can be difficult. Research studies are currently examining whether neuroimaging can detect subtle changes in [[axon]]al integrity and structural lesions that can occur in CTE.<ref name="pmid19535999" /> Recently, more progress in [[in-vivo]] diagnostic techniques for CTE has been made, using [[DTI]], [[fMRI]], [[MRI]], and [[MRS]] imaging; however, more research needs to be done before any such techniques can be validated.<ref name="Baugh C et al 2012 244–254"/>

==History==
CTE was first noticed as a “peculiar condition” casually referred to as a “punch-drunk” syndrome in boxers and prizefighters before the 1930s. It was recognized as affecting individuals who took considerable blows to the head, but was believed to be confined to boxers and not other athletes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Martland H | title=Punch Drunk|journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=91|issue=15|pages=1103–1107 |year=1928}}</ref>

In 2008, the CSTE at Boston University at the BU School of Medicine started the CSTE brain bank at the Bedford VA Hospital to analyze the effects of CTE and other neurodegenerative diseases on the brain and spinal cord of athletes, military veterans, and civilians<ref name="McKee A et al 2012 1–22"/> To date the CSTE Brain Bank is the largest CTE tissue repository in the world.<ref name="Baugh C et al 2012 244–254"/>
On December 21, 2009, the [[National Football League Players Association]] announced that it would collaborate with the CSTE at the [[Boston University School of Medicine]] to support the Center's study of repetitive brain trauma in athletes.<ref>Staff.

In 2010, Professional Wrestlers [[Mick Foley]] and [[Matt Morgan]] also agreed to donate their brains upon their deaths. Also in 2010, MLS soccer player [[Taylor Twellman]], who had to retire from the New England Revolution because of post-concussion symptoms, agreed to donate his brain upon his death.  As of 2010, the CSTE Brain Donation Registry consists of over 250 current and former athletes.<ref>Staff.

Also in 2011, boxer [[Mickey Ward]], whose career inspired the film [[The Fighter]], agreed to donate his brain upon his death.

In related research, the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes, which is part of the Department of Exercise and Sport Science at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], is conducting research funded by National Football League Charities to "study former football players, a population with a high prevalence of exposure to prior Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) and sub-concussive impacts, in order to investigate the association between increased football exposure and recurrent MTBI and neurodegenerative disorders such as cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease (AD)".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exss.unc.edu/research-and-laboratories/center-for-the-study-of-retired-athletes/current-research/|title=A Study on the Association Between Football Exposure and Dementia in Retired Football Players|publisher=UNC College of Arts and Sciences}}</ref>

These elevated levels, which were abnormally clumped and pooled along the brain sulci,<ref name="McKee A et al 2012 1–22"/> are indicative of CTE.<ref name="Deardorff"/>

In July 2010, NHL enforcer Bob Probert died of heart failure.  Before his death, he asked his wife to donate his brain to CTE research because it was noticed that Probert experienced a mental decline in his 40s.  In March 2011, researchers at Boston University concluded that Probert had CTE upon analysis of the brain tissue he donated.  He is the second NHL player from the program at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy to be diagnosed with CTE postmortem.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/sports/hockey/03fighter.html |author= Schwarz, Alan |title= Hockey Brawler Paid Price, With Brain Trauma |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 2, 2011 |accessdate=March 14, 2011}}</ref>

BUSM has also found indications of links between [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)]] and CTE in athletes who have participated in contact sports. Tissue for the study was donated by twelve athletes and their families to the CSTE Brain Bank at the Bedford, Massachusetts [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]] Medical Center.<ref>[http://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm-news/2010/08/17/researchers-discover-brain-trauma-in-sports-may-cause-a-new-disease-that-mimics-als/ "Researchers Discover Brain Trauma in Sports May Cause a New Disease That Mimics ALS"], BUSM press release, August 17th, 2010 3:41 pm.
