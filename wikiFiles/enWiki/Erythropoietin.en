'''Erythropoietin''', also known as '''erythropoetin''' or '''erthropoyetin''' ({{IPAc-en|ɨ|ˌ|r|ɪ|θ|r|ɵ|ˈ|p|ɔɪ|.|ɨ|t|ɨ|n}}, {{IPAc-en|ɨ|ˌ|r|ɪ|θ|r|ɵ|ˈ|p|ɔɪ|t|ən}}, and {{IPAc-en|ɨ|ˌ|r|iː|θ|r|ɵ|-}}) or '''EPO''', is a [[glycoprotein]] [[hormone]] that controls [[erythropoiesis]], or red blood cell production.  It is a [[cytokine]] (protein signaling molecule) for [[erythrocyte]] ([[red blood cell]]) precursors in the [[bone marrow]]. Human EPO has a molecular weight of 34 kDa.

Also called '''hematopoietin''' or '''hemopoietin''', it is produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney in close association with [[peritubular capillary]] and tubular epithelial cells.  It is also produced in perisinusoidal cells in the [[liver]].  While liver production predominates in the fetal and perinatal period, renal production is predominant during adulthood.  In addition to erythropoiesis, erythropoietin also has other known biological functions. For example, it plays an important role in the brain's response to neuronal injury.<ref name="USA 2001">{{cite journal |author=Siren AL et al. |title=Erythropoietin prevents neuronal apoptosis after cerebral ischemia and metabolic stress |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=98 |pages=4044–4049 |year=2001|doi=10.1073/pnas.051606598 |pmid=11259643 |issue=7 |pmc=31176 |last2=Fratelli |first2=M. |last3=Brines |first3=M. |last4=Goemans |first4=C. |last5=Casagrande |first5=S. |last6=Lewczuk |first6=P. |last7=Keenan |first7=S. |last8=Gleiter |first8=C. |last9=Pasquali |first9=C.}}</ref> EPO is also involved in the wound healing process.<ref name="pmid12937140">{{cite journal | author = Haroon ZA, Amin K, Jiang X, Arcasoy MO | title = A novel role for erythropoietin during fibrin-induced wound-healing response | journal = Am.

When [[exogenous]] EPO is used as a [[performance-enhancing drug]], it is classified as an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA). Exogenous EPO can often be detected in blood, due to slight differences from the endogenous protein, for example, in features of [[posttranslational modification]].

== Function ==
=== Primary role in red blood cell production ===
Erythropoietin is an essential hormone for red cell production. Without it, definitive erythropoiesis does not take place. Under [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] conditions, the kidney will produce and secrete erythropoietin to increase the production of red blood cells by targeting [[CFU-E]], pro[[erythroblast]] and basophilic erythroblast subsets in the differentiation. Erythropoietin has its primary effect on red blood cell progenitors and precursors (which are found in the bone marrow in humans) by promoting their survival through protecting these cells from [[apoptosis]].

Erythropoietin is the primary erythropoietic factor that cooperates with various other growth factors (e.g., [[interleukin 3|IL-3]], [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]], [[glucocorticoid]]s, and [[stem cell factor|SCF]]) involved in the development of [[erythroid]] lineage from [[stem cell|multipotent progenitors]]. The burst-forming unit-erythroid ([[BFU-E]]) cells start [[erythropoietin receptor]] expression and are sensitive to erythropoietin. Subsequent stage, the colony-forming unit-erythroid ([[CFU-E]]), expresses maximal erythropoietin receptor density and is completely dependent on erythropoietin for further differentiation. Precursors of red cells, the proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts also express erythropoietin receptor and are therefore affected by it.

=== Additional nonhematopoietic roles ===
Erythropoietin has a range of actions including [[vasoconstriction]]-dependent [[hypertension]], stimulating [[angiogenesis]], and inducing proliferation of [[smooth muscle]] fibers. It can increase iron absorption by suppressing the hormone [[hepcidin]].<ref name="hepcidin">{{cite journal | author = Ashby DR, Gale DP, Busbridge M, Murphy KG, Duncan ND, Cairns TD, Taube DH, Bloom SR, Tam FW, Chapman R, Maxwell PH, Choi P | title = Erythropoietin administration in humans causes a marked and prolonged reduction in circulating hepcidin | journal = Haematologica | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 505–8 | year = 2010 | month = March | pmid = 19833632 | pmc = 2833083 | doi = 10.3324/haematol.2009.013136 }}</ref>

EPO also affects neuronal protection during hypoxic conditions (stroke, etc.).<ref name="pmid11259643">{{cite journal | author = Sirén AL, Fratelli M, Brines M, Goemans C, Casagrande S, Lewczuk P, Keenan S, Gleiter C, Pasquali C, Capobianco A, Mennini T, Heumann R, Cerami A, Ehrenreich H, Ghezzi P | title = Erythropoietin prevents neuronal apoptosis after cerebral ischemia and metabolic stress | journal = Proc.

== Mechanism of action ==
Erythropoietin has been shown to exert its effects by [[protein-protein interaction|binding]] to the [[erythropoietin receptor]] (EpoR).<ref name="pmid10318834">{{cite journal | author = Middleton SA, Barbone FP, Johnson DL, Thurmond RL, You Y, McMahon FJ, Jin R, Livnah O, Tullai J, Farrell FX, Goldsmith MA, Wilson IA, Jolliffe LK | title = Shared and unique determinants of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor are important for binding EPO and EPO mimetic peptide | journal = J.

EPO is highly glycosylated (40% of total molecular weight), with half-life in blood around five hours. EPO's half-life may vary between endogenous and various recombinant versions. Additional glycosylation or other alterations of EPO via recombinant technology have led to the increase of EPO's stability in blood (thus requiring less frequent injections). EPO binds to the erythropoietin receptor on the red cell progenitor surface and activates a [[janus kinase 2|JAK2]] signaling cascade. Erythropoietin receptor expression is found in a number of tissues, such as bone marrow and peripheral/central nervous tissue. In the bloodstream, red cells themselves do not express erythropoietin receptor, so cannot respond to EPO. However, indirect dependence of red cell longevity in the blood on plasma erythropoietin levels has been reported, a process termed neocytolysis.

== Synthesis and regulation ==
Erythropoietin levels in blood are quite low in the absence of anemia, at around 10 mU/ml. However, in hypoxic stress, EPO production may increase a 1000-fold, reaching 10,000 mU/ml of blood. EPO is produced mainly by peritubular capillary lining cells of the [[renal cortex]], which are highly specialized, epithelial-like cells. It is synthesized by renal peritubular cells in adults, with a small amount being produced in the liver.<ref name=Jacobson1957>{{cite journal |author=Jacobson LO, Goldwasser E, Fried W, Plzak L |title=Role of the kidney in erythropoiesis |journal=Nature |volume=179 |issue=4560 |pages=633–4 |year=1957 |month=March |pmid=13418752 |doi= 10.1038/179633a0|url=}}</ref><ref name=Fisher1996>{{cite journal |author=Fisher JW, Koury S, Ducey T, Mendel S |title=Erythropoietin production by interstitial cells of hypoxic monkey kidneys |journal=British journal of haematology |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=27–32 |year=1996 |month=October |pmid=8857934 |doi= 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1864.x|url=}}</ref> Regulation is believed to rely on a feedback mechanism measuring blood oxygenation.<ref name=pmid17253966>{{cite journal |author=Jelkmann, W |title=Erythropoietin after a century of research: younger than ever |journal=Eur J Haematol. |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=183–205 |year=2007 |pmid=17253966|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00818.x}}</ref> Constitutively synthesized transcription factors for EPO, known as [[hypoxia-inducible factors]], are hydroxylated and proteosomally digested in the presence of oxygen.

[[Darbepoetin alfa]] is a form created by five substitutions (Asn-57, Thr-59, Val-114, Asn-115 and Thr-117) that create two new N-glycosylation sites.

More recently, a novel erythropoiesis-stimulating protein (NESP) has been produced.<ref name="pmid10928340">{{cite journal | author = Macdougall IC | title = Novel erythropoiesis stimulating protein | journal = Semin.

NESP offers chronic renal-failure patients a lower dose of hormones to maintain normal [[hemoglobin]] levels.

== Blood doping ==
[[Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent]]s (ESAs) have a history of use as [[blood doping]] agents in endurance [[sport]]s, such as [[horseracing]], [[boxing]],<ref name="The 13 most shocking scandals in boxing history.">{{cite news | url = http://bleacherreport.com/articles/965780-13-most-shocking-scandals-in-boxing-history#/articles/965780-13-most-shocking-scandals-in-boxing-history/page/5| title = Boxing Scandals | date = 2011-12| publisher = Bleacher Report| accessdate = 2011-12-22}}</ref> [[cycling]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[Distance running#Running as a sport|distance running]], [[race walking]], [[snowshoeing]], [[cross country skiing]], [[biathlon]], and [[triathlon]]. The overall oxygen delivery system (blood oxygen levels, as well as heart stroke volume, vascularization, and lung function) is one of the major limiting factors to muscles' ability to perform endurance exercise. Therefore, the primary reason athletes may use ESAs is to improve oxygen delivery to muscles, which directly improves their endurance capacity. With the advent of recombinant erythropoietin in the 1990s, the practice of autologous and homologous blood transfusion has been partially replaced by injecting erythropoietin such that the body naturally produces its own red cells. ESAs increase hematocrit (% of blood volume that is red cell mass) and total red cell mass in the body, providing a good advantage in sports where such practice is banned.<ref name="pmid21652677">{{cite journal | author = Jelkmann W, Lundby C | title = Blood doping and its detection | journal = Blood. | volume = 118 | issue = 9 | pages = 2395–404 | year = 2011 | month = September | pmid = 21652677 | isbn = 1102303271 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2011-02-303271  }}</ref> In addition to ethical considerations in sports, providing an increased red cell mass beyond the natural levels reduces blood flow due to increased viscosity, and increases the likelihood of thrombosis and stroke. Due to dangers associated with using ESAs, their use should be limited to the clinic where anemic patients are boosted back to normal hemoglobin levels (as opposed to going above the normal levels for performance advantage, leading to an increased risk of death).

Though EPO was believed to be widely used in the 1990s in certain sports, there was no way at the time to directly test for it, until in 2000, when a test developed by scientists at the French national antidoping laboratory (LNDD) and endorsed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was introduced to detect pharmaceutical EPO by distinguishing it from the nearly identical natural hormone normally present in an athlete's urine.

In 2002, at the [[2002 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City]], Dr. [[Don Catlin]], the founder and then-director of the UCLA Olympic Analytical Lab, reported finding darbepoetin alfa, a form of erythropoietin, in a test sample for the first time in sports.<ref name="urlCatlin has made a career out of busting juicers - USATODAY.com">{{cite news | url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2007-02-28-catlin-drug-lab_N.htm | title = Catlin has made a career out of busting juicers - USATODAY.com | author = Steeg JL | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2007-02-28 | work = | publisher = USA TODAY | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-03-31}}</ref> At the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, [[Alex Schwazer]], the gold medalist in the 50-kilometer [[race walk]] in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], tested positive for EPO and was disqualified.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2008-olympic-race-walk-champ-i-bought-epo-in-turkey-hid-doping-from-kostner-im-destroyed/2012/08/29/5c7b3c7a-e14d-11e1-89f7-76e23a982d06_story.html "Ousted Olympic race walk champion says he bought EPO in Turkey, hid it in refrigerator at home"]{{dead link|date=August 2012}} [[Associated Press]] story in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' (August 8, 2012)</ref>

== History ==
In 1905, [[Paul Carnot]], a professor of medicine in Paris, and his assistant, Clotilde Deflandre, proposed the idea that hormones regulate the production of red blood cells. After conducting experiments on rabbits subject to [[bloodletting]], Carnot and Deflandre attributed an increase in red blood cells in rabbit subjects to a hemotropic factor called hemopoietin. Eva Bonsdorff and Eeva Jalavisto continued to study red cell production and later called the hemopoietic substance 'erythropoietin'. Further studies investigating the existence of EPO by K.R. Reissman (unknown location) and Allan J. Erslev (Thomas Jefferson Medical College) demonstrated that a certain substance, circulated in the blood, is able to stimulate red blood cell production and increase [[hematocrit]]. This substance was finally purified and confirmed as erythropoietin, opening doors to therapeutic uses for EPO in diseases such as [[anemia]].<ref name="pmid17253966">{{cite journal | author = Jelkmann W | title = Erythropoietin after a century of research: younger than ever | journal = Eur.

[[Haematologist]] John Adamson and nephrologist [[Joseph W. Eschbach]] looked at various forms of renal failure and the role of the natural hormone EPO in the formation of red blood cells. Studying sheep and other animals in the 1970s, the two scientists helped establish that EPO stimulates the production of red cells in bone marrow and could lead to a treatment for anemia in humans. In 1968, Goldwasser and Kung began work to purify human EPO, and managed to purify milligram quantities of over 95% pure material by 1977.<ref name="pmid18467">{{cite journal | author = Miyake T | last2 = Kung | first2 = CK | last3 = Goldwasser | first3 = E | title = Purification of human erythropoietin | journal = J.

Columbia University patented the technique, and licensed it to [[Amgen]]. Controversy has ensued over the fairness of the rewards that Amgen reaped from NIH-funded work, and Goldwasser was never financially rewarded for his work.<ref name="isbn0-375-76094-6">{{cite book | author = Angell, Marcia | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = The Truth About the Drug Companies : How They Deceive Us and What to Do About It | edition = | language = | publisher = Random House Trade Paperbacks | location = New York | year = 2005 | origyear = | page = 60 | quote = | isbn = 0-375-76094-6 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>

In the 1980s, Adamson, [[Joseph W. Eschbach]], Joan C. Egrie, Michael R. Downing and Jeffrey K. Browne conducted a clinical trial at the [[Northwest Kidney Centers]] for a synthetic form of the hormone, [[Epogen]], produced by Amgen. The trial was successful, and the results were published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' in January 1987.<ref name="pmid3537801">{{cite journal | author = Eschbach JW, Egrie JC, Downing MR, Browne JK, Adamson JW | title = Correction of the anemia of end-stage renal disease with recombinant human erythropoietin.

In 1985, Lin ''et al'' isolated the human erythropoietin gene from a genomic phage library and were able to characterize it for research and production.<ref name="pmid3865178">{{cite journal | author = Lin FK, Suggs S, Lin CH, Browne JK, Smalling R, Egrie JC, Chen KK, Fox GM, Martin F, Stabinsky Z | title = Cloning and expression of the human erythropoietin gene | journal = Proc.

The industrial production of recombinant human erythropoietin (RhEpo) for treating anemia patients would begin soon after.

In 1989, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the hormone Epogen, which remains in use today.
