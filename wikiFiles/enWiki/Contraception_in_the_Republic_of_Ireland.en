The availability of '''[[contraception]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]]''' was illegal in the [[Irish Free State]] (later the [[Republic of Ireland]]) from 1935 until 1980, when it was legalised with strong restrictions, later loosened. This reflected [[Catholic teachings on sexual morality]].

==History==
=== Papal encyclicals ===
The [[Encyclical]] ''[[Casti Connubii]]'' (1930) followed the industrial production and widespread use of [[condom]]s that usually prevent [[fertilisation]]. It specified that - ''"... any use whatsoever of matrimony exercised in such a way that the act is deliberately frustrated in its natural power to generate life is an offense against the law of God and of nature, and those who indulge in such are branded with the guilt of a grave sin."'' 

Following the marketing of [[Oral contraceptive pill|"the pill"]] in the 1960s, a [[Pontifical Commission on Birth Control]] was set up. It has often been cited that there was a majority in favour of contraception, but there is no proof of this. The encyclical ''[[Humanae Vitae]]'' (1968) decreed that artificial contraception in all forms was immoral. Catholics are obliged not to use artificial contraception; as opposed to some Protestant points of view whereby one may follow one's own conscience.<ref>{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|year=1994|publisher=Veritas|isbn=1-85390-241-1|pages=395|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a6.htm#I}}</ref>

=== Ban on sales 1935-1978 ===
Owning and using contraceptive devices and pills was always legal, but they could not be sold or imported legally after a 1935 Act.<ref>Irish Statute Book: [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZA6Y1935S17.html Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935 (Section 17)]</ref> During this time a [[loophole]] was used, where a device such as a [[condom]] could not be "[[Offer and acceptance|offer]]ed for sale", but a buyer could be "[[Invitation to treat|invited to treat]]" to buy it. Also people made [[donation]]s to family planning associations to obtain contraception as a "[[Gift (law)|gift]]". The reality for almost all of the population was that such a simple matter as contraception was illegal, and few outlets wanted to stock a product that could bring the attention of the police or public opprobrium.

In early 1971 Senator [[Mary Robinson]] (who later became president) attempted to introduce the first bill proposing to liberalise the law on contraception into the [[Seanad]], but was not allowed a reading, so it could not be discussed. On 31 March a number of supporters managed to get into the grounds of Leinster House and then broke into the building to register their protests.<ref>Irish Independent, 1 April 1971</ref> On 22 May 1971 a group of [[Feminism in Ireland|Irish feminists]] including [[Mary Kenny]] travelled to [[Belfast]] by rail and made their return to [[Dublin]], laden with contraceptive devices, into a statement on the illogicality of the law. This provoked criticism from the [[Roman Catholic Church in Ireland]]; Thomas Ryan, [[Bishop_of_clonfert#Roman_Catholic_succession|Bishop of Clonfert]], said that ''"... never before, and certainly not since [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|penal times]] was the Catholic heritage of Ireland subjected to so many insidious onslaughts on the pretext of conscience, civil rights and women's liberation."''<ref>The Field day anthology of Irish writing: Irish women's writing and traditions edited by Angela Bourke; NYU Press 2002, pp. 200-201</ref> 

In 1973, the [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]] affirmed that there was a [[constitutional right]] to marital privacy which also allowed for the use of contraceptives; nevertheless it found that the Act forbidding their import or sale was not repugnant to the Constitution.<ref>BAILII: [http://www.bailii.org/ie/cases/IESC/1973/2.html McGee v. A.G. & Anor &#091;1973&#093; IESC 2; &#091;1974&#093; IR 284]</ref> Faced with the conundrum that the Irish people could legally use contraception but could not legally obtain them, the Government was embarrassed into action. A number of bills were proposed, but all failed to make it to the statute book. Indeed [[Taoiseach]] at the time, [[Jack Lynch]], admitted at one point that the issue had been put "on the long finger".

=== Reforms allowing sales ===
In 1978 the Health (Family Planning) Bill was introduced by [[Charles Haughey]]. This bill limited the provision of contraceptives to [[bona fide]] "family planning or for adequate medical reasons".<ref>Irish Statute Book: [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZA20Y1979S4.html Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979 (Section 4)]</ref> A controversial part of the bill was that contraceptives could only be dispensed by a [[pharmacist]] on the presentation of a valid [[medical prescription]] from a practising doctor. It is often wrongly stated that the recipient of the prescription had to be [[married]], but the legislation required no such terms. The reason for this compromise was the strong position of conservative elements in Irish society at the time, particularly the [[Roman Catholic Church]] which made it difficult for the government to provide for a more liberal law. Contraception was also not seen by politicians as a vote-getter at the time. Haughey famously described the 1979 Act as "[[an Irish solution to an Irish problem]]". On November 1, 1980 the Act came into operation by order<ref>Irish Statute Book: [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZSI247Y1980.html Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979 (Commencement) Order, 1980]</ref> of the Minister.

The Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1985<ref>Irish Statute Book: [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1985/en/act/pub/0004/index.html Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1985]</ref> liberalised the law by allowing [[condom]]s and [[spermicide]]s to be sold to people over 18 without having to present a prescription; however sale was limited to categories of places named in the act. The Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1992<ref>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1992/en/act/pub/0020/index.html The Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act of 1992]</ref> repealed Section 4 of the 1979 act, as amended in 1985, and continued the provision of contraceptives without prescription, allowing sale to individuals over the age of 17. As of 2010, the 1992 Act and the [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0016/index.html Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act of 1993] are the main Irish legislation on contraceptive and family planning services.

As well as allowing sales, Ireland's [[Censorship in the Republic of Ireland|censorship laws]] had to be reformed to allow contraceptives to be advertised or even mentioned. As late as 1976 the [[Censorship of Publications Board (Ireland)|Censorship of Publications Board]] had banned the [[Irish Family Planning Association]]'s booklet "Family Planning". The Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979 deleted references to "the unnatural prevention of conception" in the 1929 and 1949 censorship Acts, thus allowing publications with information about contraception to be distributed in Ireland. The Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for the Termination of Pregnancies) Act, 1995 modified the 1929, 1946 and 1967 Acts to allow publications with information about "services provided outside the State for the termination of pregnancies". However, no publications that advocate or promote [[abortion]]s are permitted.

A small percentage of the Irish population still opposes the use of artificial contraception within marriage, <!-- Do they approve of it outside marriage?? --> in line with ''Humanae Vitae'', including sports personality [[Mickey Harte]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/GAA'S+HARTE+BACKS+CONDOM+BAN%3B+Hero+supports+controversial+book.(News)-a0196914275 |title=GAA's Harte backs condom ban; Hero supports controversial book. |publisher=Irish Daily Mirror |date=April 1, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hliireland.ie/sexual_health_or_contraceptive_evangelism.html |title=Sexual Health or Contraceptive Evangelism? |publisher=Northern Ireland Pharmacy in Focus |date=January 2007 |page=25}}</ref> Newspapers such as ''[[The Irish Catholic]]'' and ''[[The Brandsma Review]]'' also have editorialized against the use of artificial contraception.
