'''Paroxysmal Nonkinesigenic Dyskinesia''' ('''PNKD''') is an [[episodic movement disorder]] first described by Mount and Reback in 1940 under the name "Familial paroxysmal choreoathetosis".<ref>Mount, L. A.; Reback, S. : 
Familial paroxysmal choreoathetosis: preliminary report on a hitherto undescribed clinical syndrome. Arch. Neurol. Psychiat. 44: 841-847, 1940.</ref>  It is a rare hereditary disease that affects various [[Muscular system|muscular]] and [[nervous system]]s in the body, passing to roughly fifty percent of the offspring.

==Genetics==
It has been mapped to [[chromosome]] 2q31-36.<ref name="archneurol">[http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/56/6/721 Archives of Neurology - Familial Paroxysmal Dystonic Choreoathetosis]</ref>

It has been associated with [[PNKD]].<ref>{{OMIM|118800}}</ref>

==Alternate names==
The condition can and has been referred to by a number of different names since it was first described, including the following:
* Paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia
* PNKD
* Paroxysmal dystonic choreoathetosis
* PDC
* Mount-Reback syndrome (in honor of [[Lester Adrian Mount]] and [[S. Reback]]; the two doctors that classified it)<ref>http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/950.html</ref>
* Nonkinesigenic choreoathetosis
* Familial paroxysmal choreoathetosis
* Choreoathetosis familial paroxysmal
* FPD1
* DYT8
* Dystonia 8

==Symptoms==
The condition manifests itself as attacks lasting from a few minutes to several hours.  Episodes only happen when the individual is awake, and they remain conscious throughout the attack. Symptoms are most severe in youth and lessen with age. Sufferers can have multiple attacks on a daily basis or may have periods of weeks or months between attacks. Symptoms experienced during attacks can vary and include [[dystonia]], [[Chorea (disease)|chorea]], [[athetosis]], [[ballismus]], or a combination.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=gene&part=pnknd NCBI Bookshelf -- GeneReviews -- Familial Paroxysmal Nonkinesigenic Dyskinesia]</ref>

== Triggers ==
While not the same in all people, there are several common triggers that can precipitate an attack:<ref name="archneurol"/><ref>[http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/medical/mount_reback_syndrome.htm WrongDiagnosis.com - Mount-Reback syndrome]</ref>
* Moderate to high consumption of [[stimulants]], such as [[alcohol]], [[caffeine]], or [[nicotine]].
* Low amounts of energy due to [[hunger]], [[sleep deprivation|lack of sleep]], [[illness]], or [[Fatigue (medical)|physical fatigue]].
* Moderate to high presence of [[Stress (biological)|stress]].
* [[Menstruation]] and [[ovulation]].

==Treatment==
Most [[pharmacological]] treatments work poorly, but the best treatment is a low dosage of [[clonazepam]], a [[muscle relaxant]].  Patients may also benefit from other [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[phenobarbital]], and other [[anticonvulsant]]s such as [[valproic acid]].<ref>[http://www.mdvu.org/library/disease/dyskinesias/pdys_tre.asp Dyskinesias (Paroxysmal) - Treatment]</ref> Affected individuals have reported [[garlic]] to be effective for softening the attacks, but no studies have been done on this.<ref name="archneurol"/>
