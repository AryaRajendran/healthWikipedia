'''Rapid urease test''', also known as the CLO test (Campylobacter-like organism test), is a rapid test for diagnosis of ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''.<ref name="urlMedscape & eMedicine Log In">{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/488068 |title=Medscape & eMedicine Log In |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  The basis of the test is the ability of ''H. pylori'' to secrete the [[urease]] enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of [[urea]] to [[ammonia]] and [[carbon dioxide]].

==Process==
The test is performed at the time of [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy|gastroscopy]].  A [[biopsy]] of mucosa is taken from the [[antrum]] of the [[stomach]], and is placed into a medium containing urea and an indicator such as [[phenol red]].  The urease produced by ''H. pylori'' hydrolyzes urea to ammonia, which raises the [[pH]] of the medium, and changes the color of the specimen from yellow (NEGATIVE) to red (POSITIVE).

==Limitations==
There is evidence to suggest that ''[[H. pylori]]'' moves proximal in the stomach in patients on therapy with [[proton pump inhibitors]], and, as such, samples from the [[fundus]] and [[body]] should be taken in these patients.

The specificity and sensitivity of this test is high compared with histopathological examination or [[urea breath test]].  The test is often done as part of point-of-care diagnostics, to eliminate the time and expense required to detect ''H. pylori'' on [[pathology]] testing.
