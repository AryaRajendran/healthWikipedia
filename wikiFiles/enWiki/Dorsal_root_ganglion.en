In [[anatomy]] and [[neuroscience]], a '''dorsal root [[ganglion]]''' (or '''spinal ganglion''') is a nodule on a [[dorsal root]] of the spine that contains cell bodies of nerve cells ([[neuron]]s) that carry signals from sensory organs toward the appropriate integration center. Nerves that carry signals toward the central nervous system (brain or spinal cord) are known as [[afferent nerve]]s.

==Unique unipolar structure==
The [[axons]] of dorsal root ganglion neurons are known as [[afferent nerve fiber|afferents]]. In the [[peripheral nervous system]], afferents refer to the axons that relay sensory information into the [[central nervous system]] (i.e. the [[brain]] and the [[spinal cord]]). These neurons are of the [[pseudo-unipolar neuron|pseudo-unipolar]] type, meaning they have an axon with two branches that act as a single axon, often referred to as a ''distal process'' and a ''proximal process''. 

<br>Note: the neuron can consist of three parts:</br>
<br>1. [[Dendrite]] that receives the information and relays it to the [[Soma (biology)|Soma, or cell body.]]
</br>2. [[Soma (biology)|Soma]] - the cell body of the neuron
<br>3. [[Axon]]: which relays information from the soma.</br>
<br>In a neuron, the dendrite receives information from another neuron's axon at the synapse, and the axon sends information to the next neuron's dendrites, even though the dendrite may be covered with [[myelin]].

Unlike the majority of neurons found in the [[central nervous system]], an [[action potential]] in dorsal root ganglion neuron may initiate in the ''distal process'' in the periphery, bypass the cell body, and continue to propagate along the ''proximal process'' until reaching the [[synaptic terminal]] in the [[posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn]] of the spinal cord.

==Distal section==
The distal section of the axon may either be a bare nerve ending or encapsulated by a structure that helps relay specific information to nerve. For example, a [[Meissner's corpuscle]] or [[Pacinian corpuscle]] may encapsulate the nerve ending, rendering the ''distal process'' sensitive to mechanical stimulation, such as stroking or vibration, respectively.<ref>[[Eric R. Kandel|Kandel ER]], Schwartz JH, Jessell TM. ''[[Principles of Neural Science]]'', 4th ed., p.431-433. McGraw-Hill, New York (2000). ISBN 0-8385-7701-6</ref>

==Location==
The dorsal root ganglia lie along the vertebral column by the spine.

==Embryology==
The dorsal root ganglia develops in the embryo from [[neural crest]] cells, not [[neural tube]]. Hence, the spinal ganglia can be regarded as gray matter of the spinal cord that became translocated to the periphery.

==Nociception==
[[Proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptors]] are expressed by DRG sensory neurons and might play a role in acid-induced [[nociception]].<ref name="pmid17720533">{{cite journal |author=Huang CW, Tzeng JN, Chen YJ, Tsai WF, Chen CC, Sun WH |title=Nociceptors of dorsal root ganglion express proton-sensing G-protein-coupled receptors |journal=Mol. Cell. Neurosci. |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=195â€“210 |year=2007 |pmid=17720533 |doi=10.1016/j.mcn.2007.06.010}}</ref>

==Mechanosensitive Channels==
The nerve endings of dorsal root ganglion neurons have a variety of sensory receptors that are activated by mechanical, thermal, chemical, and noxious stimuli.<ref name="pmid11850451">{{cite pmid | 11850451}}</ref>  In these sensory neurons, a group of [[ion channel]]s thought to be responsible for [[somatosensory system|somatosensory]] transduction have been identified.  Compression of the dorsal root ganglion by a mechanical stimulus lowers the voltage threshold needed to evoke a response and causes [[action potential]]s to be fired.<ref name="pmid8893432">{{cite pmid | 8893432}}</ref>  This firing may even persist after the removal of the stimulus.<ref name="pmid8893432"/>  

Two distinct types of [[mechanosensitive ion channel]]s have been found in the dorsal root ganglion neurons.  The two channels are broadly classified as either high-threshold (HT) or low threshold (LT) .<ref name="pmid11850451"/>  As their names suggest, they have different thresholds as well as different sensitivities to pressure.  These are cationic channels whose activity appears to be regulated by the proper functioning of the [[cytoskelton]] and cytoskeleton associated proteins.<ref name="pmid11850451"/>  The presence of these channels in the dorsal root ganglion gives reason to believe that other sensory neurons may contain them as well.

===High-Threshold Mechanosensitive Channels===
HT channels have a possible role in [[nociception]]. These channels are found predominantly in smaller sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion cells and are activated by higher pressures, two attributes that are characteristic of nociceptors.<ref name="pmid11850451"/> Also, the threshold of HT channels was lowered in the presence of PGE2 (a compound that sensitizes neurons to mechanical stimuli and mechanical hyperalgesia) which further supports a role for HT channels in the transduction of mechanical stimuli into nociceptive neuronal signals.<ref name="pmid11850451"/><ref name="pmid8893432"/><ref>{{cite pmid | 10579219}}</ref>
