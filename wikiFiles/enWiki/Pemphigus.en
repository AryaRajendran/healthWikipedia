In pemphigus, [[autoantibody|autoantibodies]] form against [[desmoglein]]. Desmoglein forms the "glue" that attaches adjacent [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] cells via attachment points called '''[[desmosomes]]'''. When autoantibodies attack desmogleins, the cells become separated from each other and the epidermis becomes "unglued", a phenomenon called [[acantholysis]]. This causes [[blister]]s that slough off and turn into [[Ulcer (dermatology)|sores]]. In some cases, these blisters can cover a significant area of the skin.<ref>[http://pemphigus.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=364&Itemid=100073/ International Pemphigus & Pemphigoid Foundation: What is Pemphigus?]</ref>

Originally, the cause of this disease was unknown, and "pemphigus" was used to refer to any blistering disease of the skin and mucosa. In 1964, a historic paper that changed the understanding of pemphigus was published.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Beutner|first1= E.

==Types==
There are several types of pemphigus which vary in severity: pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus, Intraepidermal neutrophilic IgA dermatosis, and paraneoplastic pemphigus.

*'''[[Pemphigus vulgaris]]''' (PV - [[ICD|ICD-10]] L10.0) is the most common form of the disorder and occurs when [[Antibody|antibodies]] attack ''[[Desmoglein 3]]''. Sores often originate in the [[mouth]], making eating difficult and uncomfortable. Although pemphigus vulgaris may occur at any age, it is most common among people between the ages of 40 and 60. It is more frequent among [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. Rarely, it is associated with [[myasthenia gravis]].  [[Nail disease]] may be the only finding and has prognostic value in management.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* '''[[Pemphigus foliaceus]]''' (PF) is the least severe of the three varieties. ''[[Desmoglein 1]]'', the protein that is destroyed by the autoantibody, is only found in the top dry layer of the skin. PF is characterized by crusty sores that often begin on the [[scalp]], and may move to the chest, back, and face. Mouth sores do not occur. This form is also frequent among Askenazi Jews. It is not as painful as pemphigus vulgaris, and is often mis-diagnosed as [[dermatitis]] or [[eczema]].
*'''[[Intraepidermal neutrophilic IgA dermatosis]]''' is characterized histologically by intraepidermal bullae with neutrophils, some eosinophils, and acantholysis.
* The least common and most severe type of pemphigus is '''[[paraneoplastic pemphigus]]''' (PNP). This disorder is a complication of [[cancer]], usually [[lymphoma]] and [[Castleman's disease]]. It may precede the diagnosis of the tumor. Painful sores appear on the mouth, lips, and the [[esophagus]]. In this variety of pemphigus, the disease process often involves the lungs, causing [[bronchiolitis obliterans]] (constrictive bronchiolitis). Though much less frequent, it is still found the most on the Askenazi Jewish population. Complete removal and/or cure of the tumor may improve the skin disease, but lung damage is generally irreversible .

Note that [[Hailey-Hailey disease]], also called '''familial benign pemphigus''', is an inherited (genetic) skin disease, not an autoimmune disease. It is therefore not considered part of the Pemphigus group of diseases.<ref>[http://www.haileyhailey.com/WhatIsHHD.htm Hailey Hailey Disease Society]</ref>

==Classification==
Pemphigus is a group of autoimmune blistering diseases that may be classified into the following types:<ref name="Fitz2">{{Fitzpatrick 6|59|559}}</ref>
:* [[Pemphigus vulgaris]], of which there several forms:
::* [[Pemphigus vegetans]]
:::* [[Pemphigus vegetans of Hallopeau]]
:::* [[Pemphigus vegetans of Neumann]]
:* [[Pemphigus foliaceus]], of which there several forms:
::* [[Pemphigus erythematosus]]
::* [[Endemic pemphigus]]
:* [[Paraneoplastic pemphigus]]
:* [[IgA pemphigus]], of which there several forms:
::* [[Subcorneal pustular dermatosis]]
::* [[Intraepidermal neutrophilic IgA dermatosis]]

==Diagnosis==
Pemphigus is recognized by a [[dermatologist]] from the appearance and distribution of the skin lesions. It is also commonly diagnosed by specialists practicing [[otolaryngology- head and neck surgery]], periodontists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons (highly specialized surgeons with an extensive background and qualifications in both medicine and dentistry), and [[ophthalmology|eye doctors]] as lesions can affect the eyes and mucous membrane of the oral cavity. Intraorally it resembles the more common diseases [[lichen planus]] and [[mucous membrane pemphigoid]].<ref>Sapp, J. Philip. Contemporary Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, 2nd Edition. C.V. Mosby, 092003. 8.2.4). 
<vbk:0-323-01723-1#outline(8.2.4)></ref> Definitive diagnosis requires examination of a skin or mucous membrane [[biopsy]] by a [[dermatopathologist]] or oral pathologist. The skin biopsy is taken from the edge of a blister, prepared for [[histopathology]] and examined with a [[microscope]]. The pathologist looks for an intraepidermal [[Vesicle (dermatology)|vesicle]] caused by the breaking apart of [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] cells ([[acantholysis]]). Thus, the superficial (upper) portion of the epidermis sloughs off, leaving the bottom layer of cells on the "floor" of the blister. This bottom layer of cells is said to have a "tombstone appearance".

Definitive diagnosis also requires the demonstration of anti-desmoglein autoantibodies by [[Immunofluorescence|direct immunofluorescence]] on the skin biopsy. These antibodies appear as [[IgG]] deposits along the [[desmosomes]] between epidermal cells, a pattern reminiscent of chicken wire. Anti-desmoglein antibodies can also be detected in a blood sample using the [[ELISA]] technique.

Half of pemphigus patients have oral lesions alone during the first year but develop skin lesions later.

==Treatment==
If not treated, pemphigus can be fatal from an overwhelming [[infection]] of the sores. The most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids, especially [[prednisone]], often in high doses. The side effects of corticosteroids may require the use of so-called steroid-sparing or adjuvant drugs. The immunosuppressant CellCept ([[mycophenolic acid]]) is among those being used.<ref>[http://www.bad.org.uk/public/leaflets/bad_patient_information_gateway_leaflets/pemphigus/treated/steroid.asp British Association of Dermtologists, Steroid sparing (or adjuvant) drugs]</ref>

Intravenous [[gamma globulin]] (IVIG) may be useful in severe cases, especially paraneoplastic pemphigus. Mild cases sometimes respond to the application of topical steroids. Recently, [[Rituximab]], an anti-[[CD20]] antibody, was found to improve otherwise untreatable severe cases of Pemphigus vulgaris.<ref name="pmid17065638">{{cite journal|author=Ahmed AR, Spigelman Z, Cavacini LA, Posner MR|title=Treatment of pemphigus vulgaris with rituximab and intravenous immune globulin|journal=N. Engl. J. Med.|volume=355|issue=17|pages=1772–9|year=2006|pmid=17065638|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa062930 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17687130">{{cite journal|author=Joly P, Mouquet H, Roujeau JC, ''et al.''|title=A single cycle of rituximab for the treatment of severe pemphigus|journal=N. Engl. J. Med.|volume=357|issue=6|pages=545–52|year=2007|pmid=17687130|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa067752}}</ref> 

All of these drugs may cause severe side effects, so the patient should be closely monitored by doctors. Once the outbreaks are under control, dosage is often reduced, to lessen side effects.

If paraneoplastic pemphigus is diagnosed with pulmonary disease, a powerful cocktail of immune suppressant drugs is sometimes used in an attempt to halt the rapid progression of [[bronchiolitis obliterans]], including [[methylprednisolone]], [[ciclosporin]], [[azathioprine]], and [[thalidomide]]. [[Plasmapheresis]] may also be useful.

If skin lesions do become infected, [[antibiotic]] may be prescribed. Tetracycline antibiotics have a mildly beneficial effect on the disease and are sometimes enough for Pemphigus Foliaceus. In addition, [[talcum powder]] is helpful to prevent oozing sores from adhering to bedsheets and clothes.

Pain is a common part of the disease.  Only one literature review on peer-reviewed articles reporting pemphigous pain management has been published in the professional medical literature.<ref>This can be read at:

==Pemphigus in domestic animals==
[[Image:Canine pemphigus foliaceus 3.jpg|thumb|Pemphigus foliaceus skin eruption on the ventral abdomen of a dog]]

Pemphigus foliaceus has been recognized in pet dogs, cats, and horses and is the most common autoimmune skin disease diagnosed in veterinary medicine. Pemphigus foliaceus in animals produces clusters of small vesicles that quickly evolve into pustules. Pustules may rupture, forming erosions or become crusted. Left untreated, pemphigus foliaceus in animals is life-threatening leading to loss of condition and secondary infection.

Pemphigus vulgaris is a very rare disorder described in pet dogs and cats. Paraneoplastic pemphigus has been identified in pet dogs.
