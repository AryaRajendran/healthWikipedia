'''Metabolic bone disease''' is an umbrella term referring to abnormalities of bones caused by a broad spectrum of disorders.

Most commonly these disorders are caused by abnormalities of minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, magnesium or vitamin D leading to dramatic clinical disorders that are commonly reversible once the underlying defect has been treated. These disorders are to be differentiated from a larger group of genetic bone disorders where there is a defect in a specific signaling system or cell type that causes the bone disorder. There may be overlap. For example, [[Genetics|genetic]] or [[hereditary hypophosphatemia]] may cause the metabolic bone disorder [[osteomalacia]]. Although there is currently no treatment for the genetic condition, replacement of [[phosphate]] often corrects or improves the metabolic bone disorder.

==Conditions considered to be metabolic bone disorders==
* [[osteoporosis]]
* [[Paget's disease]] of bone
* [[osteomalacia]] (adults) & [[rickets]] (children)
* [[osteitis fibrosa cystica]]

[[Osteoporosis]] is due to causal factors like [[atrophy]] of disuse and gonadal deficiency. Hence osteoporosis is common in post menopausal women and in men above 50 yrs. Hypercorticism may also be causal factor- osteoporosis may be seen as a feature of Cushing's syndrome.
