'''Phytosterols''', which encompass plant [[sterol]]s and [[plant stanol ester|stanols]], are steroid compounds similar to [[cholesterol]] which occur in plants and vary only in carbon side chains and/or presence or absence of a double bond. Stanols are [[saturated fat|saturated]] sterols, having no double bonds in the sterol ring structure. More than 200 sterols and related compounds have been identified.<ref>{{cite book |title=Physiology and Biochemistry of Sterols |year=1991 |publisher=American Oil Chemists' Society |location=Champaign, IL |pages=172–228 |last1=Akhisa |first1=T. |last2=Kokke |first2=W. |editor1-first=G. W. |editor1-last=Patterson |editor2-first=W. D. |editor2-last=Nes |chapter=Naturally occurring sterols and related compounds from plants}}</ref> Free phytosterols extracted from oils are insoluble in water, relatively insoluble in oil, and soluble in alcohols.  

Phytosterol-enriched foods and dietary supplements have been marketed for decades. Despite well documented cholesterol-lowering effect, no evidence of any beneficial effect on [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD) or overall mortality exists.<ref name=Weingaertner_2008/>

*By removing carbon 24<sup>1</sup>, [[campesterol]] is obtained.
*By removing carbons 24<sup>1</sup> and 24<sup>2</sup>, [[cholesterol]] is obtained.
*Removing a hydrogen from carbons 22 and 23 yields [[stigmasterol]] (stigmasta-5,22-dien-3β-ol).
*By hydrogenating the double bond between carbon 5 and 6, β-[[sitostanol]] is obtained.
*By hydrogenating the double bond between carbon 5 and 6 and removing carbon 24<sup>1</sup>, [[campestanol]] is obtained.
*Removing carbon 24<sup>2</sup> and hydrogens from carbons 22 and 23, and inverting the stereochemistry at C-24 yields [[brassicasterol]] (ergosta-5,22-dien-3β-ol).
*Further removal of hydrogens from carbons 7 and 8 from brassicasterol yields [[ergosterol]] (ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3β-ol). Important: Ergosterol is not a plant sterol. Ergosterol is a component of fungal cell membranes, serving the same function in fungi that cholesterol serves in animal cells.

==Dietary phytosterols==
The richest naturally occurring sources of phytosterols are vegetable oils and products made from them. Nuts, which are rich in phytosterols, are often eaten in smaller amounts, but can still significantly contribute to total phytosterol intake. Cereal products, vegetables, fruit and berries, which are not as rich in phytosterols, may also be significant sources of phytosterols due to their higher intakes.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=671–8 |doi=10.1079/BJN20041234 |title=Estimation of plant sterol and cholesterol intake in Finland: Quality of new values and their effect on intake |year=2007 |last1=Valsta |first1=L.

==Health claims==

===EFSA===
The European Foods Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that blood cholesterol can be reduced on average by 7 to 10.5% if a person consumes 1.5 to 2.4 grams of plant sterols and stanols every day. The scientists found that the effect is usually established within the first 2–3 weeks. Longer-term studies extending up to 85 weeks showed that the cholesterol-lowering effect could be sustained.<ref>{{cite web|last=European Food Safety Authority|title=Blood cholesterol reduction health claims on phytosterols can now be judged against EFSA new scientific advice|url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/nda090731.htm}}</ref> 
Based on this and other efficacy data the EFSA scientists consider the following health claims to reflect the available scientific knowledge: “Plant sterols have been shown to lower/reduce blood cholesterol. Blood cholesterol lowering may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease" and “[[Plant stanol ester]]s have been shown to lower/reduce blood cholesterol. Blood cholesterol lowering may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease".<ref>{{cite web|last=European Food Safety Authority|title=Plant Sterols and Blood Cholesterol - Scientific substantiation of a health claim related to plant sterols and lower/reduced blood cholesterol and reduced risk of (coronary) heart disease pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006[1]|url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/781.pdf}}</ref>

===FDA===
The FDA has approved the following claim for phytosterols:  ''For plant [[sterol ester]]s'': (i) Foods containing at least 0.65 g per serving of plant sterol esters, eaten twice a day with meals for a daily total intake of at least 1.3 g, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease.

The FDA is currently reviewing the health claims for phytosterols.<ref>{{cite web|last=FDA|title=Food Labeling; Health Claim; Phytosterols  and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease;  Proposed Rule|url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/2010-30386.pdf}}</ref> When reviewing clinical trials involving phytosterol supplementation, the FDA concluded that when consumed in the range of 1 to 3 grams in enriched foods, phytosterols resulted in statistically significant (5-15%) reductions in blood LDL cholesterol levels relative to placebo. The FDA also concluded that a daily dietary intake of 2 grams a day of phytosterols (expressed as non-esterified phytosterols) is required to make an authorized health claim relating phytosterol consumption to cholesterol lowering and CVD risk.<ref>{{cite web|last=FDA|title=Food Labeling; Health Claim; Phytosterols  and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease;  Proposed Rule|url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/2010-30386.pdf}}</ref>

===Health Canada===
Health Canada reviewed the evidence of 84 randomized controlled trials published between 1994-2007 involving phytosterol supplementation. An average of 8.8% reduction in LDL-cholesterol was observed at a mean intake of 2 grams per day.<ref>{{cite web|last=Health Canada|title=Plant Sterols and Blood Cholesterol  Lowering|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/alt_formats/pdf/label-etiquet/claims-reclam/assess-evalu/phytosterols-claim-allegation-eng.pdf}}</ref>  Health Canada concluded that sufficient scientific evidence exists to support a relationship between phytosterol consumption and blood cholesterol lowering. Based on this evidence Health Canada approved the following statements for qualifying foods intended for moderately to highly hypercholesterolemic individuals:
Primary statement:
"[serving size from Nutrition Facts table in metric and common household measures] of [naming the product] provides X% of the daily amount* of plant sterols shown to help reduce/lower cholesterol in adults."
Two additional statements that could be used in combination or alone, adjacent to the primary statement, without any intervening printed, written or graphic material:

==Cholesterol lowering==
The ability of phytosterols to reduce [[cholesterol]] levels was first demonstrated in humans in 1953.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=13042924 |year=1953 |last1=Pollak |first1=OJ |title=Reduction of blood cholesterol in man |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=702–6 |journal=Circulation |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.7.5.702}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3942097 |year=1986 |last1=Tilvis |first1=RS |last2=Miettinen |first2=TA |title=Serum plant sterols and their relation to cholesterol absorption |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=92–7 |journal=The American journal of clinical nutrition}}</ref> They were subsequently marketed as a pharmaceutical under the name Cytellin as a treatment for elevated cholesterol from 1954-1982.<ref name="Jones2007">{{cite journal |pmid=17951490 |year=2007 |last1=Jones |first1=PJ |title=Ingestion of phytosterols is not potentially hazardous |volume=137 |issue=11 |pages=2485; author reply 2486 |journal=The Journal of nutrition}}</ref>

Unlike the [[statin]]s, where cholesterol lowering has been proven to reduce CVD risk and overall mortality under well-defined circumstances, no such effect has ever been documented with phytosterol-enriched foods or phytosterol OTC medications.<ref name=Weingaertner_2008/><ref name=Genser_2012>{{cite pmid| 22334625}}</ref> While cholesterol lowering was frequently used as a [[surrogate endpoint]] for beneficial effects on CVD, counter-examples exist where specific medications for cholesterol lowering were found to have unfavorable effect on clinical endpoints, such as with [[ezetimibe]].

Coadministration of statins with phytosterol-enriched foods increases the cholesterol-lowering effect of phytosterols, again without any proof of clinical benefit and with anecdotal evidence of dangerous adverse effects.<ref name=Weingaertner_2008/> 

Statins work by reducing cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting the rate-limiting HMG-CoA reductase enzyme. Phytosterols reduce cholesterol levels by competing with cholesterol absorption in the gut, a mechanism which complements statins.  Phytosterols further reduce cholesterol levels by about 9% to 17% in statin users.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=20439548 |year=2009 |last1=Scholle |first1=JM |last2=Baker |first2=WL |last3=Talati |first3=R |last4=Coleman |first4=CI |title=The effect of adding plant sterols or stanols to statin therapy in hypercholesterolemic patients: Systematic review and meta-analysis |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=517–24 |journal=Journal of the American College of Nutrition}}</ref> The type or dose of statin does not appear to affect phytosterols’ cholesterol-lowering efficacy.<ref name="Katan2003">{{cite journal |pages=965–78 |doi=10.4065/78.8.965 |title=Efficacy and Safety of Plant Stanols and Sterols in the Management of Blood Cholesterol Levels |year=2003 |last1=Katan |first1=M.

A potential safety concern regarding phytosterol consumption is in patients with [[sitosterolemia|phytosterolaemia]], a rare genetic disorder which results in a 50- to 100-fold increase in blood plant sterol levels and is associated with rapid development of coronary atherosclerosis.  Phytosterolaemia has been linked to mutations in the ABCG5/G8 proteins which pump plant sterols out of enterocytes and hepatocytes into the lumen and bile ducts, respectively. Plant sterol levels in the blood have been shown to be positively, negatively or not associated with CVD risk, depending on the study population investigated.<ref name="Silbernagel2009">{{cite journal |pages=334–41 |doi=10.1194/jlr.P800013-JLR200 |title=The relationships of cholesterol metabolism and plasma plant sterols with the severity of coronary artery disease |year=2008 |last1=Silbernagel |first1=G. |last2=Fauler |first2=G. |last3=Renner |first3=W. |last4=Landl |first4=E.

The link between plant sterols and CVD or CHD risk is complicated because phytosterol levels reflect cholesterol absorption. (See [[#Phytosterols as a marker for cholesterol absorption|Phytosterols as a marker for cholesterol absorption]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Sterol vs stanol===
The equivalent ability and safety of plant sterols and plant stanols to lower cholesterol continues to be a hotly debated topic.

In phytosterolemia, the rapid development of CVD is most likely due to the improper handling of cholesterol, which is elevated and accounts for the vast majority of sterols in phytosterolemics.<ref name="Pp" /> Because plant sterol levels actually reflect cholesterol absorption, some have concluded elevated cholesterol absorption, not plant sterols are atherogenic or otherwise associated with CVD risk.<ref name="Silbernagel2009" /><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=14749249 |year=2004 |last1=Vanstone |first1=CA |last2=Jones |first2=PJ |title=Limitations of plasma plant sterols as indicators of cholesterol absorption |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=340–1 |journal=Am J Clin Nutr}}</ref>
