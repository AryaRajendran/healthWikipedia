In [[medicine]], '''splenic infarction''' is a condition in which oxygen supply to the [[spleen]] is interrupted, leading to partial or complete [[infarction]] (tissue death due to oxygen shortage) in the organ.<ref name="pmid3764696">{{cite journal |author=Jaroch MT, Broughan TA, Hermann RE |title=The natural history of splenic infarction |journal=Surgery |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages=743–50 |year=1986 |month=October |pmid=3764696 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Splenic infarction occurs when the [[splenic artery]] or one of its branches are occluded, for example by a [[blood clot]]. Although it can occur [[asymptomatic]]ally, the typical symptom is severe [[abdominal pain|pain]] in the [[left upper quadrant (abdomen)|left upper quadrant of the abdomen]], sometimes radiating to the left shoulder. Fever and chills develop in some cases.<ref name="pmid9486895"/> It has to be differentiated from other causes of [[acute abdomen]].

An abdominal [[CT scan]] is the most commonly used modality to confirm the diagnosis,<ref name="pmid9486895"/> although abdominal ultrasound can also contribute.<ref name="pmid15290950">{{cite journal |author=Görg C, Seifart U, Görg K |title=Acute, complete splenic infarction in cancer patient is associated with a fatal outcome |journal=Abdom Imaging |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=224–7 |year=2004 |pmid=15290950 |doi=10.1007/s00261-003-0108-9 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid3773568">{{cite journal |author=O'Keefe JH, Holmes DR, Schaff HV, Sheedy PF, Edwards WD |title=Thromboembolic splenic infarction |journal=Mayo Clin.

There is no specific treatment, except treating the underlying disorder and providing adequate [[analgesia|pain relief]]. Splenectomy is only required if complications ensue; surgical removal predisposes to [[overwhelming post-splenectomy infection]]s.<ref name="pmid18510036">{{cite journal |author=Salvi PF, Stagnitti F, Mongardini M, Schillaci F, Stagnitti A, Chirletti P |title=Splenic infarction, rare cause of acute abdomen, only seldom requires splenectomy.

==Causes==
Several factors may increase the [[hypercoagulability|tendency for clot formation]], such as specific [[infection]]s (such as [[infectious mononucleosis]],<ref name="pmid17562611">{{cite journal |author=Suzuki Y, Shichishima T, Mukae M, ''et al.'' |title=Splenic infarction after Epstein-Barr virus infection in a patient with hereditary spherocytosis |journal=Int.

In some conditions, blood clots form in one part of the circulatory system and then dislodge and travel to another part of the body, which could include the spleen. These [[embolism|emboligenic]] disorders include [[atrial fibrillation]], [[patent foramen ovale]], [[endocarditis]] or [[cholesterol embolism]].

Splenic infarction is also more common in hematological disorders with associated [[splenomegaly]], such as the [[myeloproliferative disorder]]s. Other causes of [[splenomegaly]] (for example, [[Gaucher disease]] or [[hemoglobinopathy|hemoglobinopathies]]) can also predispose to infarction. Splenic infarction can also result from a [[sickle cell crisis]] in patients with [[sickle cell anemia]]. Both splenomegaly and a tendency towards clot formation feature in this condition. In sickle cell disease, repeated splenic infarctions lead to a non-function spleen ([[autosplenectomy]]).

Any factor that directly compromises the splenic artery can cause infarction. Examples include abdominal traumas, [[aortic dissection]], torsion of the splenic artery (for example, in [[wandering spleen]]) or external compression on the artery by a [[tumor]]. It can also be a complication of vascular procedures.<ref name="pmid18684317">{{cite journal |author=Almeida JA, Riordan SM |title=Splenic infarction complicating percutaneous transluminal coeliac artery stenting for chronic mesenteric ischaemia: a case report |journal=J Med Case Reports |volume=2 |issue= |pages=261 |year=2008 |pmid=18684317 |pmc=2533016 |doi=10.1186/1752-1947-2-261 |url=}}</ref>

Splenic infarction can be due to [[vasculitis]] or [[diffuse intravascular coagulation]]. Various other conditions have been associated with splenic infarction in case reporters, for example [[Wegener's granulomatosis]]<ref name="pmid10852290">{{cite journal |author=Rentsch J, McColl G |title=Splenic infarction in Wegener's granulomatosis |journal=J. Rheumatol. |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=1554–5 |year=2000 |month=June |pmid=10852290 |doi= |url=}}</ref> or treatment with drugs that predispose to [[vasospasm]] or [[thrombosis]], like vasoconstrictors used to treat [[esophageal varices]], [[sumatriptan]]<ref name="pmid16767537">{{cite journal |author=Arora A, Arora S |title=Spontaneous splenic infarction associated with sumatriptan use |journal=J Headache Pain |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=214–6 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16767537 |doi=10.1007/s10194-006-0291-5 |url=}}</ref> or [[bevacizumab]].<ref name="pmid17138227">{{cite journal |author=Malka D, Van den Eynde M, Boige V, Dromain C, Ducreux M |title=Splenic infarction and bevacizumab |journal=Lancet Oncol. |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=1038 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17138227 |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(06)70980-9 |url=}}</ref>

==Therapeutic splenic infarction==
Splenic infarction can be induced for the treatment of such conditions as [[portal hypertension]] or [[Ruptured spleen|splenic injury]].<ref name="pmid15761342">{{cite journal |author=Haan JM, Bochicchio GV, Kramer N, Scalea TM |title=Nonoperative management of blunt splenic injury: a 5-year experience |journal=J Trauma |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=492–8 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15761342 |doi= 10.1097/01.TA.0000154575.49388.74|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0022-5282&volume=58&issue=3&spage=492}}</ref> It can also be used prior to [[splenectomy]] for the prevention of [[blood loss]].
