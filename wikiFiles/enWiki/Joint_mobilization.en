{{See also |Joint manipulation}}

'''Joint mobilization''' is a type of passive movement of a skeletal joint. It is usually aimed at a 'target' [[synovial joint]] with the aim of achieving a [[therapeutic]] effect. When applied to the spine, it is known as [[spinal mobilization]]. These techniques are often used by chiropractors, osteopaths, [[occupational therapists]], and physical therapists. 

== Terminology ==

Mobilization is a [[manual therapy]] intervention and is classified by five 'grades' of motion, each of which describes the [[range of motion]] of the target joint during the procedure.<ref> Maitland, G.D. ''Peripheral Manipulation'' 2nd ed. Butterworths, London, 1977.<br>
Maitland, G.D. ''Vertebral Manipulation'' 5th ed. Butterworths, London, 1986.</ref>

[[Roman numerals]] are generally used in labelling the grades of motion (i.e. Grades I to V). Grade V is the same as [[joint manipulation|manipulation]].

==Mechanisms of action==

The different grades of mobilization are believed to produce selective activation of different [[mechanoreceptors]] in the joint:{{PDFlink|[http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/hkjo/view/47/4700061.pdf How Manipulation Works]}}.

* Grade I - Activates Type I mechanoreceptors with a low threshold and which respond to very small increments of tension.

: Activates cutaneous mechanoreceptors.

: Oscillatory motion will selectively activate the dynamic, rapidly adapting receptors, i.e., [[Meissner's corpuscle|Meissner's]] and [[Pacinian corpuscle|Pacinian Corpuscles]]. The former respond to the rate of skin indentation and the latter respond to the acceleration and retraction of that indentation.

* Grade II - Similar effect as Grade I.

:
* Grade III - Similar to Grade II.

: Selectively activates more of the muscle and joint mechanoreceptors as it goes into resistance, and less of the cutaneous ones as the slack of the subcutaneous tissues is taken up.

* Grade IV - Similar to Grade III.

: With its more sustained movement at the end of range will activate the static, slow adapting, Type I mechanoreceptors, whose resting discharge rises in proportion to the degree of change in joint capsule tension.

* Grade V - This is the same as [[joint manipulation]]. Use of the term 'Grade V' is only valid if the joint is positioned near to its end range of motion during joint manipulation. Evans and Breen<ref>{{cite journal | author = Evans DW, Breen AC. | title = A biomechanical model for mechanically efficient cavitation production during spinal manipulation: prethrust position and the neutral zone. | journal = J Manipulative Physiol Ther | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 72â€“82 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16396734 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmpt.2005.11.011}}</ref> recently contested this assumption, in fact arguing that an individual synovial joint should be positioned near to its resting, neutral position.
