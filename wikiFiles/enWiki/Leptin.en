'''Leptin''' (Greek ''λεπτός'' (''leptos'') meaning "thin") is a 16-[[Atomic mass unit|kDa]] [[protein]] [[hormone]] that plays a key role in regulating energy intake and expenditure, including [[appetite]]/hunger, [[metabolism]], as well as [[behavior]]. It is one of the most important [[adipose-derived hormones]].<ref name="pmid16932309">{{cite journal | author = Brennan AM, Mantzoros CS | title = Drug Insight: the role of leptin in human physiology and pathophysiology--emerging clinical applications | journal = Nat Clin Pract Endocrinol Metab | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | pages = 318–327 | year = 2006 | month = June | pmid = 16932309 | doi = 10.1038/ncpendmet0196 }}</ref>  Leptin functions by binding to the [[leptin receptor]].

== Discovery ==
The effects of leptin were observed by studying [[mutant]] [[ob/ob mouse|obese mice]] that arose at random within a mouse colony at the [[Jackson Laboratory]] in 1950.<ref name="pmid14824537">{{cite journal | author = Ingalls AM, Dickie MM, Snell GD | title = Obese, a new mutation in the house mouse | journal = J.

Ultimately, several strains of laboratory mice have been found to be [[zygosity|homozygous]] for single-gene mutations that cause them to become obese, and they fall into two classes: "ob/ob", those having mutations in the gene for the protein hormone leptin, and "db/db", those having mutations in the gene that encodes the receptor for leptin. When ob/ob mice are treated with injections of leptin, they lose their excess fat and return to normal body weights.

Leptin itself was co-discovered in 1994 by [[Jeffrey M. Friedman]] and [[Rudolph Leibel]] at the [[Rockefeller University]] and [[Douglas L.

== Biosynthesis ==
Human leptin is a protein of 167 amino acids. It is manufactured primarily in the adipocytes of [[white adipose tissue]], and the level of circulating leptin is proportional to the total amount of fat in the body.

In addition to white adipose tissue&mdash;the major source of leptin&mdash;it can also be produced by [[brown adipose tissue]], [[placenta]] (syncytiotrophoblasts), [[ovaries]], [[skeletal muscle]], [[stomach]] (the lower part of the fundic glands), [[mammary gland|mammary]]  [[epithelial cell]]s, [[bone marrow]], [[pituitary]], and [[liver]].<ref name=Margetic>{{cite journal |author=Margetic S, Gazzola C, Pegg GG, Hill RA |title=Leptin: a review of its peripheral actions and interactions |journal=Int.

== Function ==

Leptin acts on receptors in the hypothalamus of the brain, where it inhibits appetite 
#counteracting the effects of [[neuropeptide Y]] (a potent feeding stimulant secreted by cells in the gut and in the hypothalamus)
#counteracting the effects of [[anandamide]] (another potent feeding stimulant that binds to the same receptors as [[THC]])
#promoting the synthesis of [[α-MSH]], an appetite suppressant.  
This appetite inhibition is long-term, in contrast to the rapid inhibition of eating by [[cholecystokinin]] (CCK) and the slower suppression of hunger between meals mediated by [[PYY3-36]].  The absence of leptin (or its receptor) leads to uncontrolled food intake and resulting obesity. Several studies have shown [[fasting]] or following a [[very-low-calorie diet]] (VLCD) lowers leptin levels.<ref>Studies include:

In the short-term, leptin might be an indicator of energy balance.

=== Adiposity signal ===

To date, only leptin and [[insulin]] are known to act as [[adiposity]] signals.  In general,

* Leptin circulates at levels directly proportional to [[adipose tissue|body fat]].
* It enters the [[central nervous system]] in proportion to its [[blood plasma|plasma]] concentration.
* Its receptors are found in brain neurons involved in regulating energy intake and expenditure.
* It controls food intake and energy expenditure by acting on receptors in the mediobasal [[hypothalamus]].<ref name="pmid19176744">{{cite journal | author = Williams KW, Scott MM, Elmquist JK | title = From observation to experimentation: leptin action in the mediobasal hypothalamus | journal = Am.

=== Interaction with amylin ===

Coadministration of two neurohormones known to have a role in body weight control, [[amylin]] (produced by beta cells in the pancreas) and leptin (produced by fat cells), results in sustained, fat-specific weight loss in a leptin-resistant animal model of obesity.<ref name="pmid18458326">{{cite journal | author = Roth JD, Roland BL, Cole RL, Trevaskis JL, Weyer C, Koda JE, Anderson CM, Parkes DG, Baron AD | title = Leptin responsiveness restored by amylin agonism in diet-induced obesity: evidence from nonclinical and clinical studies | journal = Proc.

=== Satiety ===

Leptin binds to [[neuropeptide Y]] (NPY) neurons in the [[arcuate nucleus]] in such a way as to decrease the activity of these neurons. Leptin signals the brain that the body has had enough to eat, producing a feeling of satiety.  Moreover, this fullness hormone may make it easier for people to resist the temptation of foods high in calories.<ref name="pmid17986612">{{cite journal | author = Baicy K, London ED, Monterosso J, Wong ML, Delibasi T, Sharma A, Licinio J | title = Leptin replacement alters brain response to food cues in genetically leptin-deficient adults | journal = Proc.

Circulating leptin levels give the brain input regarding energy storage, so it can regulate [[appetite]] and [[metabolism]]. Leptin works by inhibiting the activity of [[neurons]] that contain neuropeptide Y (NPY) and [[agouti-related peptide]] (AgRP), and by increasing the activity of [[neurons]] expressing [[α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone]] (α-MSH). The NPY neurons are a key element in the regulation of appetite; small doses of NPY injected into the brains of experimental animals stimulates feeding, while selective destruction of the NPY neurons in mice causes them to become [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexic]]. Conversely, α-MSH is an important mediator of satiety, and differences in the [[gene]] for the receptor at which α-MSH acts in the brain are linked to [[obesity]] in humans.

A very small group of humans possesses [[homozygous]] mutations for the leptin gene, leading to a constant desire for food and resulting in severe obesity. This condition can be treated somewhat successfully by the administration of recombinant human leptin.<ref name="pmid15472169">{{cite journal | author = Gibson WT, Farooqi IS, Moreau M, DePaoli AM, Lawrence E, O'Rahilly S, Trussell RA | title = Congenital leptin deficiency due to homozygosity for the Delta133G mutation: report of another case and evaluation of response to four years of leptin therapy | journal = J.

Large and frequent doses are needed to provide only modest benefit because of leptin’s low circulating half-life, low potency, and poor solubility. Furthermore, these injections caused some participants to drop out of the study due to inflammatory responses of the skin at the injection site. Some of these problems can be alleviated by a form of leptin called Fc-leptin, which takes the Fc fragment from the immunoglobulin gamma chain as the N-terminal fusion partner and follows it with leptin. This Fc-leptin fusion has been experimentally proven to be highly soluble, more biologically potent, and contain a much longer serum half-life. As a result, this Fc-leptin was successfully shown to treat obesity in both leptin-deficient and normal mice, although studies have not been undertaken on human subjects. This makes Fc-leptin a potential treatment for obesity in humans after more extensive testing.<ref name="pmid9796811">{{cite journal | author = Friedman JM, Halaas JL | title = Leptin and the regulation of body weight in mammals | journal = Nature | volume = 395 | issue = 6704 | pages = 763–770 | year = 1998 | month = October | pmid = 9796811 | doi = 10.1038/27376 }}</ref><ref name="pmid10546697">{{cite journal | author = Heymsfield SB, Greenberg AS, Fujioka K, Dixon RM, Kushner R, Hunt T, Lubina JA, Patane J, Self B, Hunt P, McCamish M | title = Recombinant leptin for weight loss in obese and lean adults: a randomized, controlled, dose-escalation trial | journal = JAMA | volume = 282 | issue = 16 | pages = 1568–1575 | year = 1999 | month = October | pmid = 10546697 | doi = 10.1001/jama.282.16.1568}}</ref><ref name="pmid15790575">{{cite journal | author = Lo KM, Zhang J, Sun Y, Morelli B, Lan Y, Lauder S, Brunkhorst B, Webster G, Hallakou-Bozec S, Doaré L, Gillies SD | title = Engineering a pharmacologically superior form of leptin for the treatment of obesity | journal = Protein Eng.

=== Lung surfactant activity ===
In [[fetal]] lung, leptin is induced in the alveolar interstitial fibroblasts ("lipofibroblasts") by the action of [[PTHrP]] secreted by formative alveolar epithelium (endoderm) under moderate stretch.

=== Reproduction ===

In mice, leptin is also required for male and female [[fertility]]. It has a lesser effect in humans. In [[mammals]] such as humans, ovulatory cycles in females are linked to energy balance (positive or negative depending on whether a female is losing or gaining weight) and energy flux (how much energy is consumed and expended) much more than energy status (fat levels). When energy balance is highly negative (meaning the woman is starving) or energy flux is very high (meaning the woman is exercising at extreme levels, but still consuming enough calories), the ovarian cycle stops and females stop menstruating. Only if a female has an extremely low body fat percentage does energy status affect menstruation. Some studies have indicated leptin levels outside an ideal range can have a negative effect on egg quality and outcome during ''in vitro'' fertilization.<ref name="pmid15798029">{{cite journal | author = Anifandis G, Koutselini E, Louridas K, Liakopoulos V, Leivaditis K, Mantzavinos T, Sioutopoulou D, Vamvakopoulos N | title = Estradiol and leptin as conditional prognostic IVF markers | journal = Reproduction | volume = 129 | issue = 4 | pages = 531–534 | year = 2005 | month = April | pmid = 15798029 | doi = 10.1530/rep.1.00567 }}</ref>

=== Inflammatory marker ===

Factors that acutely affect leptin levels are also factors that influence other markers of inflammation, e.g., testosterone, sleep, emotional stress, caloric restriction, and body fat levels. While it is well-established that leptin is involved in the regulation of the [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] response,<ref name="pmid9732873">{{cite journal | author = Lord GM, Matarese G, Howard JK, Baker RJ, Bloom SR, Lechler RI | title = Leptin modulates the T-cell immune response and reverses starvation-induced immunosuppression | journal = Nature | volume = 394 | issue = 6696 | pages = 897–901 | year = 1998 | month = August | pmid = 9732873 | doi = 10.1038/29795 }}</ref><ref name="Fantuzzi_2000">{{cite journal | author = Fantuzzi G, Faggioni R | title = Leptin in the regulation of immunity, inflammation, and hematopoiesis | journal = J.

Similar to what is observed in chronic inflammation, chronically elevated leptin levels are associated with obesity, overeating, and inflammation-related diseases, including [[hypertension]], [[metabolic syndrome]], and [[cardiovascular disease]]. However, while leptin is associated with body fat mass, the size of individual fat cells, and the act of overeating, it is interesting that it is not affected by exercise (for comparison,  [[Inflammation#Post-inflammatory muscle growth and repair|IL-6 is released in response to muscular contractions]]). Thus, it is speculated that leptin responds specifically to adipose-derived inflammation.<ref name="pmid7585224">{{cite journal | author = Hamilton BS, Paglia D, Kwan AY, Deitel M | title = Increased obese mRNA expression in omental fat cells from massively obese humans | journal = Nat.

Taken as such, increases in leptin levels (in response to caloric intake) function as an acute pro-inflammatory response mechanism to prevent excessive cellular stress induced by overeating. When high caloric intake overtaxes fat cells' ability to [[hypertrophy|grow larger]] or [[hyperplasia|increase in number]] in step with caloric intake, the ensuing stress response leads to inflammation at the cellular level and ectopic fat storage, i.e., the unhealthy storage of body fat within internal organs, arteries, and/or muscle. The insulin increase in response to the caloric load provokes a dose-dependent rise in leptin, an effect potentiated by high cortisol levels.<ref name="pmid8826983">{{cite journal | author = Wabitsch M, Jensen PB, Blum WF, Christoffersen CT, Englaro P, Heinze E, Rascher W, Teller W, Tornqvist H, Hauner H | title = Insulin and cortisol promote leptin production in cultured human fat cells | journal = Diabetes | volume = 45 | issue = 10 | pages = 1435–1438 | year = 1996 | month = October | pmid = 8826983 | doi = 10.2337/diabetes.45.10.1435}}</ref> (This insulin-leptin relationship is notably similar to insulin's effect on the increase of IL-6 gene expression and secretion from [[adipocytes|preadipocytes]] in a time- and dose-dependent manner.)<ref name="pmid18617614">{{cite journal | author = LaPensee CR, Hugo ER, Ben-Jonathan N | title = Insulin stimulates interleukin-6 expression and release in LS14 human adipocytes through multiple signaling pathways | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 149 | issue = 11 | pages = 5415–5422 | year = 2008 | month = November | pmid = 18617614 | pmc = 2584585 | doi = 10.1210/en.2008-0549  }}</ref> Furthermore, plasma leptin concentrations have been observed to gradually increase when [[acipimox]] is administered to prevent [[lipolysis]], concurrent hypocaloric dieting and weight loss notwithstanding.<ref name="pmid11022182">{{cite journal | author = Worm D, Vinten J, Vaag A, Henriksen JE, Beck-Nielsen H | title = The nicotinic acid analogue acipimox increases plasma leptin and decreases free fatty acids in type 2 diabetic patients | journal = Eur.

This response may then protect against the harmful process of ectopic fat storage, which perhaps explains the connection between chronically elevated leptin levels and ectopic fat storage in obese individuals.

=== Obesity and leptin resistance ===
Although leptin reduces appetite as a circulating signal, obese individuals generally exhibit an unusually high circulating concentration of leptin.<ref name="pmid8532024">{{cite journal | author = Considine RV, Sinha MK, Heiman ML, Kriauciunas A, Stephens TW, Nyce MR, Ohannesian JP, Marco CC, McKee LJ, Bauer TL | title = Serum immunoreactive-leptin concentrations in normal-weight and obese humans | journal = N.

The  sustained high concentrations of leptin from the enlarged [[adipose]] stores result in leptin desensitization. The pathway of leptin control in obese people might be flawed at some point, so the body does not adequately receive the satiety feeling subsequent to eating.

Some researchers attempted to explain the failure of leptin to prevent obesity in modern humans as a metabolic disorder, possibly caused by a specific nutrient or a combination of nutrients not present or uncommon in the prehistoric diet. Some proposed "villain" nutrients include [[lectin]]s<ref name="pmid16336696">{{cite journal | author = Jönsson T, Olsson S, Ahrén B, Bøg-Hansen TC, Dole A, Lindeberg S | title = Agrarian diet and diseases of affluence--do evolutionary novel dietary lectins cause leptin resistance? | journal = BMC Endocr Disord | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 10 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16336696 | pmc = 1326203 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6823-5-10 }}</ref> and [[fructose]].<ref name="pmid18703413">{{cite journal | author = Shapiro A, Mu W, Roncal C, Cheng KY, Johnson RJ, Scarpace PJ | title = Fructose-induced leptin resistance exacerbates weight gain in response to subsequent high-fat feeding | journal = Am.

A [[signal-to-noise ratio]] theory has been proposed to explain the phenomenon of leptin resistance.<ref name="Pilon"/> In healthy individuals, baseline leptin levels are between 1 and 5&nbsp;ng/dl in men and 7 and 13&nbsp;ng/dl in women.<ref name="Pilon"/> A large intake of calories triggers a leptin response that reduces hunger, thereby preventing an overload of the inflammatory response induced by caloric intake. In obese individuals, the leptin response to caloric intake is theorized to be blunted due to chronic, low-grade hyperleptinemia, depressing the signal-to-noise ratio such that acute leptin responses have less of a physiological effect on the body.

Although leptin resistance is sometimes described as a metabolic disorder that contributes to obesity, similar to the way [[insulin resistance]] is sometimes described as a metabolic disorder that has the potential to progress into type 2 diabetes, it is not certain that it is true in most cases. The mere fact that leptin resistance is extremely common in obese individuals suggests it may simply be an adaptation to excess body weight. The major physiological role of leptin is suggested to be not as a “satiety signal” to prevent obesity in times of energy excess, but as a “starvation signal” to maintain adequate fat stores for survival during times of energy deficit,<ref name="pmid19644451">{{cite journal | author = Oswal A, Yeo G | title = Leptin and the control of body weight: a review of its diverse central targets, signaling mechanisms, and role in the pathogenesis of obesity | journal = Obesity (Silver Spring) | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 221–9 | year = 2010 | month = February | pmid = 19644451 | doi = 10.1038/oby.2009.228 }}</ref><ref name="pmid16781741">{{cite journal | author = Banks WA, Farr SA, Morley JE | title = The effects of high fat diets on the blood-brain barrier transport of leptin: failure or adaptation? | journal = Physiol.

Although the notion of obesity as a state of 'leptin resistance' has become ingrained in the minds of many researchers, some observations do not directly support this contention. For example, the work of Rudolph Leibel at Columbia University has shown that, in both obese and lean individuals, leptin injections do not reduce body mass. Despite the lack of response in obese and lean subjects, there is little argument that lean subjects are also leptin-resistant; hence, whether obese subjects are in fact resistant to leptin remains to be empirically demonstrated. This finding also underscores the notion that the brain is not designed to respond to increased leptin by decreasing food intake; rather, as discussed above, lack of leptin acts as a signal to increase food intake. Indeed, Leibel's work has shown that the decreases in serum leptin that occur post-weight-loss constitute a state of leptin deficiency, which drives increased appetite. As such, leptin injections in weight-reduced patients can prevent the increases in appetite and thereby allow patients to maintain weight loss. These studies therefore demonstrate that leptin treatment may be a useful strategy to treat obesity in humans, if not by driving weight loss directly then by allowing weight loss (as a result of diet and exercise) to be more readily maintained.

=== Interactions with fructose ===

The consumption of high amounts of [[fructose]] is suggested to cause leptin resistance and elevated [[triglyceride]]s in rats.  The rats consuming the high-fructose diet subsequently ate more and gained more weight than controls when fed a high-fat, high-calorie diet.<ref name="pmid18703413">{{cite journal | author = Shapiro A, Mu W, Roncal C, Cheng KY, Johnson RJ, Scarpace PJ | title = Fructose-induced leptin resistance exacerbates weight gain in response to subsequent high-fat feeding | journal = Am.

=== Leptin and weight regain ===

Dieters who lose weight experience a drop in levels of circulating leptin. This drop causes reversible decreases in thyroid activity, sympathetic tone, and energy expenditure in skeletal muscle, and increases in muscle efficiency and parasympathetic tone. The result is that a person who has lost weight has a lower basal metabolic rate than an individual at the same weight who has never lost weight; these changes are leptin-mediated, homeostatic responses meant to reduce energy expenditure and promote weight regain. Many of these changes are reversed by peripheral administration of recombinant leptin to restore pre-diet levels.<ref name="Ahima_2008">{{cite journal | author = Ahima RS | title = Revisiting leptin's role in obesity and weight loss | journal = J.

A decline in levels of circulating leptin also changes brain activity in areas involved in the regulatory, emotional, and cognitive control of food intake that are reversed by administration of leptin.<ref name="Ahima_2008"/>

Whether leptin can cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] to access receptor neurons is unknown, because the blood–brain barrier is attenuated in the area of the [[median eminence]], close to where the NPY neurons of the arcuate [[nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nucleus]] are located.  Leptin is generally thought to enter the brain at the [[choroid plexus]], where the intense expression of a form of leptin receptor molecule could act as a transport mechanism.

Once leptin has bound to the Ob-Rb receptor, it activates the stat3, which is phosphorylated and travels to the nucleus to presumably effect changes in gene expression. One of the main effects on gene expression is the down-regulation of the expression of [[endocannabinoids]], responsible for increasing appetite.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Other intracellular pathways are activated by leptin, but less is known about how they function in this system.  In response to leptin, receptor neurons have been shown to remodel themselves, changing the number and types of synapses that fire onto them.

Leptin action is recognized to be more decentralized than previously assumed. In addition to its endocrine action at a distance (from adipose tissue to brain), leptin also acts as a [[paracrine]] mediator.<ref name=Margetic />

Recently, leptin microinjections into the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) have been shown to elicit sympathoexcitatory responses, and potentiate the cardiovascular responses to activation of the chemoreflex.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ciriello J, Moreau JM | title = Systemic administration of leptin potentiates the response of neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract to chemoreceptor activation in the rat | journal = J.

== Metreleptin ==

An analog of human leptin, [[metreleptin]], is under investigation for the treatment of diabetes and/or [[hypertriglyceridemia]], in patients with rare forms of [[lipodystrophy]], syndromes characterized by abnormalities in adipose tissue distribution, and severe metabolic abnormalities. [[Amylin Pharmaceuticals]], the drug's developer, has received [[orphan drug designation]] for metreleptin from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Orphan Products Development, as well as fast track designation for this indication. In a three-year study of metreleptin in patients with lipodystrophy organized by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, metreleptin treatment was associated with a significant decrease in blood glucose (A1c decreased from 9.4% at baseline to 7.0% at study end) and triglyceride concentration (from 500&nbsp;mg/dl at baseline to 200&nbsp;mg/dl at study end).<ref name="url_Amylin_Pharmaceuticals_Press_Release">{{cite web | url = http://investors.amylin.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=101911&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1550945&highlight | title =Amylin to Present Data Showing Investigational Metreleptin Treatment Led to Long-Term Improvements in Diabetes and Lipid Control in Patients with Lipodystrophy | date = 2011-04-15 | work = Press Release | publisher =  Amylin Pharmaceuticals | accessdate = 2011-10-27 }}</ref> The [[Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation]] has also partnered with [[Amylin Pharmaceuticals]] and researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center to study whether metreleptin can be used to improve the treatment of [[type 1 diabetes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=JDRF & Amylin Partner to Investigate Therapy to Improve Blood Glucose Control|url=http://www.jdrf.org/index.cfm?page_id=114682|work=Press Release|publisher=JDRF}}</ref>
