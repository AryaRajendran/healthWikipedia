:''Compare: [[Brain fog]]''

'''Brain fag''' is an example of a [[culture-bound syndrome]].  Now a common term for mental exhaustion, it was initially a term used almost exclusively in West Africa. Brain fag can be defined as one's reaction to the demanding tasks or situations of school. Seen predominantly in male students, with symptoms such as [[depression (mood)|depression]], difficulty concentrating, remembering, and thinking. Additional symptoms are pain and pressure around the head and neck,and blurring of vision. <ref>Katona, C & Robertson, M. (2005, 3rd ed.) ''Psychiatry at a Glance'', Oxford: Blackwell Publishing. ISBN 1-4051-2404-0</ref>  It has similar symptoms to the Trinidadian illness ''studiation madness''. 

Medical electricity machines were sold to treat "brain fag" and other "nervous" ailments in England in the late 19th Century.<ref>Advertisement featured on ''Who Do You Think You Are'', BBC1, 26th Sep 2012</ref> "The term "brain fag" was used in the US as far back as 1852, describing an overworked brain,<ref>Forbes Winslow, M.D, The Journal of Psychological Medicine and Mental Pathology, 1852,5(270)</ref> in 1877 to describe mental exhaustion in professionals similar to [[neurasthenia]],<ref>John Forsyth Meigs,''A History of the First Quarter of the Second Century of the Pennsylvania Hospital'', 1877</ref> and later in 1919 to describe [[mental fatigue]] in the elderly.<ref>Malford Wilcox Thewlis, ''Geriatrics ; a treatise on senile conditions, diseases of advanced life, and care of the aged'', 1919</ref> The term 'fag' is believed to have been derived from 'fatigue'.  This American usage declined by the 1950s. The modern African usage was first described in 1960. Brain fag occurs most commonly in sub-Saharan Africa.

A Nigerian study in 2002 found that proficiency in English may be a risk factor.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Morakinjo | first = O. | coauthors = Peltzer, K. | year = 2002 | title = 'Brain fag' symptoms in apprentices in Nigeria | journal = Psychopathology | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 362–6 | publisher = | issn = | pmid = 12590195 | doi = 10.1159/000068594| format = Abstract | accessdate = 2009-01-06 | quote = }}</ref>  In South Africa, another large study found that [[socioeconomic]] status, female birth order, and depression were linked to the illness. A possible [[etiology (medicine)|aetiology]] may be the "[[cultural clash]]" between African and Western societies.<ref>{{Cite pmid|8163359}}</ref> Generally brain fag is  considered to be a depressive disorder, possibly linked with [[anxiety]] disorders.<ref>{{cite pmid|10079714}}</ref> Various possible aetiological aspects are discussed and it is felt that the syndrome is not directly related to genetic factors, intelligence, parental literacy, study habits or family responsibilities. The hypothesis is presented that the syndrome is in some way related to the imposition of European learning techniques upon the Nigerian personality. It is suggested that European learning techniques emphasize isolated endeavour, individual responsibility and orderlines—activities and traits which are foreign to the Nigerian by reason of the collectivistic society from which he derives, with its heightened “orality” and permissiveness. <ref>http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/106/443/559.abstract</ref>
