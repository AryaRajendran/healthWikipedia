== Signs and Symptoms ==

Symptoms are very similar to those found in [[benign fasciculation syndrome]] and include:<ref name="Cramp-fasciculation syndrome: a treatable hyperexcitable peripheral nerve disorder.">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1648679</ref>

== Diagnosis ==

The procedure of diagnosis for Cramp Fasciculation Syndrome (CFS) is closely aligned with the diagnosis procedure for [[benign fasciculation syndrome]] (BFS). The differentiation between a diagnosis of BFS versus CFS is usually more severe and prominent pain, cramps and stiffness associated with CFS.

== Treatment ==

Treatment is similar to treatment for [[benign fasciculation syndrome]]. 

[[Carbamazepine]] therapy has been found to provide moderate reductions in symptoms.<ref name="Cramp-fasciculation syndrome: a treatable hyperexcitable peripheral nerve disorder."/>
