In [[oncology]], '''small intestine cancer''', also '''small bowel cancer''' and '''cancer of the small bowel''', is a [[cancer]] of the [[small intestine]]. It is relatively rare compared to other [[Gastrointestinal cancer|gastrointestinal malignancies]] such as [[gastric cancer]] (stomach cancer) and [[colorectal cancer]].<ref name=terry>Terry SM, Santora T. Benign Neoplasm of the Small Intestine. eMedicine.com. URL: [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2652.htm http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2652.htm]. Accessed on: June 2, 2006.</ref> 

Small intestine cancer can be subdivided into [[duodenal cancer]] (the first part of the small intestine) and cancer of the [[jejunum]] and [[ileum]] (the later two parts of the small intestine).  Duodenal cancer has more in common with [[stomach cancer]], while cancer of the jejunum and ileum have more in common with [[colorectal cancer]].

Several different subtypes of small intestine cancer exist.  These include:
*[[adenocarcinoma]]
*[[gastrointestinal stromal tumor]]
*[[lymphoma]]
*[[ileal carcinoid tumor]]

*[[Crohn's disease]] 
*[[Celiac disease]]
*[[Ionizing radiation|Radiation exposure]]
*Hereditary gastrointestinal [[cancer syndrome]]s: [[familial adenomatous polyposis]], [[hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer]], [[Peutz-Jeghers syndrome]]
*[[Male]]s are 25% more likely to develop the disease

[[Benign tumour]]s and conditions that may be mistaken for cancer of the small bowel:
*[[Hamartoma]]
*[[Tuberculosis]]
