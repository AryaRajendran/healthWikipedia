'''Asepsis''' is the state of being free from disease-causing contaminants (such as [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[fungi]], and [[parasitism|parasites]]) or, preventing contact with microorganisms. The term '''asepsis'''  often refers to those practices used to promote or induce asepsis in an operative field in [[surgery]] or [[medicine]] to prevent [[infection]]. Ideally, a surgical field is "[[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]]," meaning it is free of all biological contaminants, not just those that can cause disease, putrefaction, or fermentation, but that is a situation that is difficult to attain, especially given the patient is often a source of infectious agents. Therefore, there is no current method to safely eliminate all of the patients' contaminants without causing significant tissue damage.  However, elimination of infection is the goal of asepsis, not sterility.

==History==
The modern concept of asepsis evolved in the 19th century. [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] showed that washing the hands prior to delivery reduced [[puerperal fever]]. After the suggestion by [[Louis Pasteur]], [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister]] introduced the use of [[carbolic acid]] as an antiseptic and reduced surgical infections rates. [[Lawson Tait]] went from antisepsis to asepsis, introducing principles and practices that have remained valid to this day. [[Ernst von Bergmann]] introduced the [[autoclave]], a device used for the practice of the sterilization of surgical instruments.

==Methods==
Today's techniques include a series of steps that complement each other. Foremost remains good [[hygiene|hygienic]] practice. The procedure room is laid out according to specific guidelines, subject to regulations concerning filtering and [[air current|airflow]], and kept clean between surgical cases. A patient who is brought for the procedure is washed and wears a clean gown. The surgical site is washed, possibly shaved, and skin is exposed to a [[germicide]] (e.g., an [[iodine]] solution such as [[betadine]]). In turn, members of the surgical team wash hands and arms with germicidal solution. Operating surgeons and nurses wear sterile gowns and gloves. Hair is covered and a surgical mask is worn. Instruments are sterilized through autoclaving, or, if disposable, are used  once. Irrigation is used in the surgical site. [[Surgical suture|Suture]] material or [[xenograft]]s have been sterilized beforehand. Dressing material is sterile. Antibiotics are often not necessary in a "clean" case, that is, a surgical procedure where no infection is apparent; however, when a case is considered "contaminated," they are usually indicated.

Dirty and biologically contaminated material is subject to regulated disposal.
