The '''[[GM1]] [[gangliosidoses]]''' are caused by a deficiency of [[beta-galactosidase]], with resulting abnormal storage of acidic [[lipid]] materials in [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of the central and peripheral [[nervous system]]s, but particularly in the nerve cells.

==Types==
GM1 has three forms:  early infantile, late infantile, and adult.

===Early infantile GM1===
Symptoms of early infantile GM1 (the most severe subtype, with onset shortly after birth) may include [[neurodegeneration]], [[seizures]], [[liver]] ([[hepatomegaly]]) and [[spleen]] ([[splenomegaly]])  enlargement, coarsening of facial features, skeletal irregularities, joint stiffness, distended abdomen, muscle weakness, exaggerated startle response to sound, and problems with [[gait]].  

About half of affected patients develop cherry-red spots in the [[human eye|eye]].  

Children may be [[deaf]] and [[Blindness|blind]] by age 1 and often die by age 3 from [[cardiac]] complications or [[pneumonia]].

Autosomal recessive disorder; beta-galactosidase deficiency; neuronal storage of GM1 ganglioside and visceral storage of galactosyl oligosaccharides and keratan sulfate.
Early psychomotor deterioration: decreased activity and lethargy in the first weeks; never sit; feeding problems - failure to thrive; visual failure (nystagmus noted) by 6 months; initial hypotonia; later spasticity with pyramidal signs; secondary microcephaly develops; decerebrate rigidity by 1 year and death by age 1–2 years (due to pneumonia and respiratory failure); some have hyperacusis.
Macular cherry-red spots in 50% by 6–10 months; corneal opacities in some 
Facial dysmorphology: frontal bossing, wide nasal bridge, facial edema (puffy eyelids); peripheral edema, epicanthus, long upper lip, microretrognathia, gingival hypertrophy (thick alveolar ridges), macroglossia 
Hepatomegaly by 6 months and splenomegaly later; some have cardiac failure
Skeletal deformities: flexion contractures noted by 3 months; early subperiosteal bone formation (may be present at birth); diaphyseal widening later; demineralization; thoracolumbar vertebral hypoplasia and beaking at age 3–6 months; kyphoscoliosis. Dysostosis multiplex (as in the mucopolysaccharidoses).
10-80% of peripheral lymphocytes are vacuolated; foamy histiocytes in bone marrow; visceral mucopolysaccharide storage similar to that in Hurler disease; GM1 storage in cerebral gray matter is 10 fold elevated (20-50-fold increased in viscera)
Galactose-containing oligosacchariduria and moderate keratan sulfaturia 
Morquio disease Type B: Mutations with higher residual beta-galactosidase activity for the GM1 substrate than for keratan sulfate and other galactose-containing oligosaccharides have minimal neurologic involvement but severe dysostosis resembling Morquio disease type A (Mucopolysaccharidosis type 4).

===Late infantile GM1===
Onset of late infantile GM1 is typically between ages 1 and 3 years.  

Neurological symptoms include [[ataxia]], seizures, [[dementia]], and difficulties with speech.

===Adult GM1===
Onset of adult GM1 is between ages 3 and 30.  

Symptoms include muscle atrophy, neurological complications that are less severe and progress at a slower rate than in other forms of the disorder, corneal clouding in some patients, and [[dystonia]] (sustained muscle contractions that cause twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures). [[Angiokeratomas]] may develop on the lower part of the trunk of the body. Most patients have a normal size liver and spleen.
