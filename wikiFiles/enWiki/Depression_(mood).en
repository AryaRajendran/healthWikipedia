'''Depression''' is a state of low [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] and aversion to activity that can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, feelings and [[subjective well-being|sense of well-being]].<ref name="Salmans1995">{{cite book |last=Salmans |first=Sandra |title=Depression: Questions You Have&nbsp;– Answers You Need |year=1997 |publisher=People's Medical Society |isbn=978-1-882606-14-6}}</ref> Depressed people may feel sad, [[Anxiety|anxious]], empty, hopeless, worried, helpless, [[self-esteem#Low self-esteem|worthless]], guilty, irritable, hurt, or restless. They may lose interest in activities that once were pleasurable, experience loss of appetite or overeating, have problems concentrating, remembering details, or making decisions, and may contemplate or attempt [[suicide]]. [[Insomnia]], [[hypersomnia|excessive sleeping]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], loss of energy, or aches, pains, or digestive problems that are resistant to treatment may also be present.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/depression/complete-index.shtml |title=NIMH · Depression |work=[[National Institute of Mental Health|nimh.nih.gov]] |accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref>

Depressed mood is not necessarily a psychiatric disorder. It may be a normal reaction to certain life events, a symptom of some medical conditions, and a side effect of some medical treatments. Depressed mood is also a primary or associated feature of certain psychiatric [[syndrome]]s such as [[major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].

== Causes ==

=== Life events ===
[[File:Depression-loss of loved one.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A young woman facing severe distresses.]]
Life events and changes that may precipitate depressed mood include [[menopause]], financial difficulties, job problems, relationship troubles, separation, bereavement, and [[catastrophic injury]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schmidt |first=Peter |year=2005 |pmid=16414327|title=Mood, Depression, and Reproductive Hormones in the Menopausal Transition |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=118 Suppl 12B |pages=54–8 |doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2005.09.033 |issue=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rashid |first1=T. |last2=Heider |first2=I. |title=Life Events and Depression |year=2008 |journal=Annals of Punjab Medical College |volume=2 |issue=1 |url=http://www.pmc.edu.pk/Downloads/apmc/apmc_v2n1/Life%20Events%20And%20Depression.pdf |accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref>

=== Medical treatments, alcohol and other drugs ===
Certain medications are known to cause depressed mood in a significant number of patients. These include [[hepatitis C]] drug therapy and some drugs used to treat high blood pressure, such as [[beta-blockers]] or [[reserpine]].
High rates of [[major depressive disorder]] occur in heavy alcohol drinkers and those who abuse alcohol. Whether major depressive disorder causes self-medicating alcohol abuse, or alcohol abuse increases the risk for the disorder is not known.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Fergusson DM, Boden JM, Horwood LJ|title=Tests of causal links between alcohol abuse or dependence and major depression|journal=Arch. Gen. Psychiatry|volume=66|issue=3|pages=260–6|year=2009|month=March|pmid=19255375|doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2008.543|url=http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=483005}}</ref>

=== Non-psychiatric illnesses ===
Depressed mood can be the result of a number of infectious diseases and physiological problems including [[hypoandrogenism]] (in men), [[Addison's disease]], [[Lyme disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[sleep apnea]], and disturbed [[circadian rhythm]]. It is often one of the early symptoms of [[hypothyroidism]] (reduced activity of the thyroid gland). [[Chronic pain]] causes depression. For a discussion of non-psychiatric conditions that can cause depressed mood, see [[Depression (differential diagnoses)]].

=== Psychiatric syndromes ===
A number of psychiatric syndromes feature depressed mood as a main symptom. The [[mood disorder]]s are a group of disorders considered to be primary disturbances of mood. These include [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD; commonly called major depression or clinical depression) where a person has at least two weeks of depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities; and [[dysthymia]], a state of chronic depressed mood, the symptoms of which do not meet the severity of a [[major depressive episode]]. Another mood disorder, [[bipolar disorder]], features one or more episodes of abnormally elevated energy levels, cognition, and mood, but may also involve one or more depressive episodes.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gabbard |first=Glen O. |title=Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders |edition=3rd |volume=2 |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |location=[[Washington, DC]] |page=1296}}</ref> When the course of depressive episodes follows a seasonal pattern, the disorder (major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, etc.) may be described as a [[seasonal affective disorder]].

Outside the mood disorders: [[borderline personality disorder]] commonly features depressed mood; [[Adjustment disorder|adjustment disorder with depressed mood]] is a mood disturbance appearing as a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor, in which the resulting emotional or behavioral symptoms are significant but do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode;<ref name="psychiatric355">{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a| p=355}}</ref> and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], an [[anxiety disorder]] that sometimes follows trauma, is commonly accompanied by depressed mood.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vieweg |first1=W.

== Prevention ==
There is an increasing focus on [[Mental disorders#Prevention|prevention of mental disorders]]. Research has shown a reduction in incidence of new cases of depressive disorders when people participated in therapeutic interventions, for instance by 22% and 38% in meta-analyses.<ref>{{cite report|author=Cuijpers, P.|date=September 20, 2012|title=Prevention and early treatment of mental ill-health|url=http://congres.efpa.eu/downloads/Pim-Cuijpers_Prevention-and-early-treatment-of-mental-ill-health-EFPASep%202012.pdf|VU university medical center}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=100218|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.07091422|title=Preventing the Onset of Depressive Disorders: A Meta-Analytic Review of Psychological Interventions|year=2008|last1=Cuijpers|first1=Pim|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=165|issue=10|pages=1272–80|pmid=18765483|last2=Van Straten|first2=A|last3=Smit|first3=F|last4=Mihalopoulos|first4=C|last5=Beekman|first5=A}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|pmc = 3397158|year = 2012|last1 = Cuijpers|first1 = P|last2 = Beekman|first2 = AT|last3 = Reynolds Cf|first3 = III|title = Preventing Depression: A Global Priority|volume = 307|issue = 10|pages = 1033–1034|doi = 10.1001/jama.2012.271|journal = Jama|pmid = 22416097 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1598159|doi=10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-033109-132040|title=Prevention of Major Depression|year=2010|last1=Muñoz|first1=Ricardo F.|last2=Cuijpers|first2=Pim|last3=Smit|first3=Filip|last4=Barrera|first4=Alinne Z.|last5=Leykin|first5=Yan|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=6|pages=181–212|pmid=20192789}}</ref><ref name="annualreviews.org">{{Cite journal|author=Muñoz R.F., Cuijpers P., Smit F., Barrera A.Z., and Leykin Y.|year=2010|title=Prevention of Major Depression|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=6|pages=181–212|doi=10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-033109-132040 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-033109-132040}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid = 15100560 | doi=10.1097/00004583-200405000-00007 | volume=43 | issue=5 | title=A randomized placebo-controlled trial of a school-based depression prevention program | year=2004 | month=May | author=Merry S, McDowell H, Wild CJ, Bir J, Cunliffe R | journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry | pages=538–47}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Gillham J.E., Gallop R., Reivich K.J., Freres D.R., Chaplin T.M., Shatte´A.J., Samuels B., Elkon A.G.L., Litzinger S., Lascher M. and Seligman M.E.P.|year=2007|title=School-Based Prevention of Depressive Symptoms: A Randomized Controlled Study of the Effectiveness and Specificity of the Penn Resiliency Program|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|volume=75|issue=1|pages=9–19|publisher=American Psychology Association|doi=10.1037/0022-006X.75.1.9|url=http://www.corstone.org/html/downloads/Penn%20Resiliency%20Program.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid = 17907851 | doi=10.1037/0022-006X.75.5.693 | volume=75 | issue=5 | title=Prevention of depressive symptoms in adolescents: a randomized trial of cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal prevention programs | year=2007 | month=October | author=Horowitz JL, Garber J, Ciesla JA, Young JF, Mufson L | journal=J Consult Clin Psychol | pages=693–706}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|pmc = 2737625|year = 2009|last1 = Garber|first1 = J|last2 = Clarke|first2 = GN|last3 = Robin Weersing|first3 = V|last4 = Beardslee|first4 = WR|last5 = Brent|first5 = DA|last6 = Gladstone|first6 = TR|last7 = Debar|first7 = LL|last8 = Lynch|first8 = FL|last9 = d’Angelo|first9 = E|title = Prevention of Depression in At-Risk Adolescents: A Randomized Controlled Trial|volume = 301|issue = 21|pages = 2215–2224|doi = 10.1001/jama.2009.788|journal = JAMA : the journal of the American Medical Association }}</ref><ref name="psycnet.apa.org">http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/67/4/285/</ref> In a study of patients with sub-threshold depression, those who received minimal-contact psychotherapy had an incidence of a major depressive disorder one year later a third lower (an incidence rate of 12% rather than 18%) than the control group.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid = 15516551 | doi=10.1192/bjp.185.5.416 | volume=185 | title=Minimal-contact psychotherapy for sub-threshold depression in primary care.

== Assessment ==
{{main|Rating scales for depression}}
[[File:Dysthymia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A woman facing depression.]]
A depression rating scale is a psychiatric measuring instrument having descriptive words and phrases that indicate the severity of depression symptoms for a time period.[1] When used, an observer may make judgements and rate a person at a specified scale level with respect to identified characteristics. Rather than being used to diagnose depression, a depression rating scale may be used to assign a score to a person's behaviour where that score may be used to determine whether that person should be evaluated more thoroughly for a depressive disorder diagnosis. Several rating scales are used for this purpose.

A full patient medical history, physical assessment, and thorough evaluation of symptoms helps determine the cause of the depression. Standardized questionnaires can be helpful such as the [[Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zimmerman |first1=M. |last2=Chelminski |first2=I |last3=Posternak |first3=M. |date=September 2004 |title=A Review of Studies of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale in Healthy Controls: Implications for the Definition of Remission in Treatment Studies Of Depression |journal=J Nerv Ment Dis |volume=192 |issue=9 |pages=595–601 |pmid=15348975 |doi=10.1097/01.nmd.0000138226.22761.39}}</ref> and the [[Beck Depression Inventory]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2850.2009.01469.x |title=A Narrative Review of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Implications for its Use in an Alcohol-Dependent Population |last1=McPherson |first1=A. |last2=Martin |first2=C.

A doctor generally performs a medical examination and selected investigations to rule out other causes of symptoms. These include blood tests measuring [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] and [[thyroxine]] to exclude [[hypothyroidism]], [[Blood tests#Biochemical analysis|basic electrolytes]], and serum [[calcium]] to rule out a [[Metabolic disorder|metabolic disturbance]] and a [[Complete blood count|full blood count]] including [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR]] to rule out a [[systemic infection]] or chronic disease.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dale |first1=J. |last2=Sorour |first2=E. |last3=Milner |first3=G. |year=2008 |title=Do Psychiatrists Perform Appropriate Physical Investigations for Their Patients?

==Treatment==

Different sub-divisions of depression have different treatment approaches.<ref>http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/12329/45890/45890.pdf,</ref>

== Incidence ==

=== In young adults ===

Forty-four percent of American college students report feeling symptoms of depression.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ranking America's Mental Health: An Analysis of Depression Across the States |url=http://www.nmha.org/go/state-ranking |publisher=Mental Health America |accessdate=19 January 2012}}</ref> This data suggests that traditional college aged students may be at high risk for depression or depressed mood.

Each year 44 colleges and universities use random sampling to administer the American College Health Association's (ACHA) National College Health Assessment (NCHA) survey to 28,000 students. This assessment surveys students' health status and behavior, including depression and depressive symptoms, for their previous academic year. Based on the findings, the rates of students reporting having been diagnosed with depression have increased from 10% in 2000<ref name="Reference Group Data Report 2000">{{cite web |title=Reference Group Data Report 2000 |url=http://www.acha-ncha.org/docs/ACHA-NCHA_Reference_Group_Report_Fall2000.pdf |publisher=American College Health Association National College Health Assessment |accessdate=20 February 2012}}</ref> to 21% in 2011.<ref name="acha-ncha.org">{{cite web |title=Reference Group Data Report Spring 2011 |url=http://www.acha-ncha.org/docs/ACHA-NCHA-II_ReferenceGroup_DataReport_Spring2011.pdf |publisher=American College Health Association National College Health Assessment |accessdate=20 February 2012}}</ref> In 2011, female students reported depressive symptoms, including 22% feeling that things were hopeless; 23% feeling lonely; and 26% feeling very sad within the preceding two weeks<ref name="Reference Group Data Report 2000"/> to 21% in 2011.<ref name="acha-ncha.org"/> Women are at higher risk than men to experience depression.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Nolen-Hoeksema|first=Susan|title=Gender Differences in Depression|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |year=2001 |month=October |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=173–176 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00142}}</ref>

=== In prisoners ===
Offenders have very high rates of mental ill health with recent estimates suggesting that between  50-70% of individuals serving custodial sentences have some diagnosable unipolar depression.<ref>{{cite isbn|9781906633059|noedit}}</ref>  The way depression is managed in prisons has also been the topic of much discussion.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=LD|title=Psychosocial treatments for depression in UK Criminal Justice&nbsp;– A Review of the Evidence|journal=Scottish Universities Medical Journal|year=2012|month=Aug|volume=1:008|pages=1–13|url=http://sumj.dundee.ac.uk/data/uploads/epub-article/008-sumj.review.pdf}}</ref> An American  study  of  5,305  Texan  prisoners with a diagnosed depressive disorder noted considerable variation in prescribing patterns and use of psychosocial  interventions between prison instituitions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baillargeon|first=J|coauthors=Black Contreras S, Grady J & Pulvino J|title=Anti‐depressant Prescribing Patterns among Prison Inmates with Depressive Disorders|journal=J Affect Disord|volume=63|issue=1–3|pages=225‐33|doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(00)00188-9|year=2001}}</ref> The study showed that just over a fifth of patients with depression remained untreated despite a confirmed diagnosis. Similar concerns have been voiced in the UK by John Podmore, the former Head of Community Prisons and Transitional Facilities, noting that, 'Even the best prisons with the best regimes and most committed staff will struggle to create an environment where anxiety and depression do not flourish.'<ref>{{cite journal|last=Podmore J|title=Mental Health in Prisons|journal=Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health Lecture|year=2006|url=http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/news/2006_prison_mental_health_care_major_priority_says_former _governor.aspx}}</ref>
