The '''alternative pathway''' of the [[complement system]] is an [[Innate immune system|innate]] component of the [[immune system]]'s natural defense against infections.

The alternative pathway is one of three complement pathways that [[opsonize]] and kill pathogens.  The pathway is triggered when the C3b protein directly binds the microbe.

==Cascade==
It is initiated by the spontaneous [[hydrolysis]] of [[C3 (complement)|C3]], which is abundant in the blood plasma.
"Tickover" occurs through the spontaneous cleavage of the thioester bond in C3 to form C3(H<SUB>2</SUB>O).  

This change in shape allows the binding of plasma protein [[Complement factor B|Factor B]], which allows [[Factor D]] to cleave Factor B into Ba and Bb.  

Bb remains part of the C3(H<SUB>2</SUB>O) to form C3(H<SUB>2</SUB>O)Bb. This complex is also known as a fluid-phase [[C3-convertase]].  This convertase, although only produced in small amounts, can cleave multiple C3 proteins into C3a and C3b.

The alternative pathway C3-convertase consists of the activated B and C3b factors, forming an unstable compound that can become stable after binding [[properdin]], a serum protein. 

After the creation of C3 convertase, the complement system follows the same path regardless of the means of activation (alternative, classical, or lectin). Binding of another C3b-fragment to the C3-convertase of the alternative pathway creates a C5-convertase analoguous to the lectin or classical pathway.

The C5-convertase of the alternative pathway consists of C3bBbC3b also referred to as C3b<sub>2</sub>Bb (instead of C4b2a3b in the other pathways).

==Regulation==
Since C3b is free and abundant in the plasma, it can bind to either a host cell or a pathogen surface.  To prevent complement activation from proceeding on the host cell, there are several different kinds of regulatory proteins that disrupt the complement activation process:
* Complement Receptor 1 (CR1 or [[CD35]]) and DAF ([[decay accelerating factor]] also known as [[CD55]]) compete with Factor B in binding with C3b on the cell surface and can even remove Bb from an already formed C3bBb complex
* The formation of a C3 convertase can also be prevented when a plasma protease called [[complement factor I]] cleaves C3b into its inactive form, iC3b.  Factor I requires a C3b-binding protein cofactor such as complement factor H, CR1, or Membrane Cofactor of Proteolysis (MCP or [[CD46]])
* [[Factor H|Complement Factor H]] can inhibit the formation of the C3 convertase by competing with factor B for binding to C3b;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Conrad DH, Carlo JR, Ruddy S |title=Interaction of beta1H globulin with cell-bound C3b: quantitative analysis of binding and influence of alternative pathway components on binding |journal=J.
