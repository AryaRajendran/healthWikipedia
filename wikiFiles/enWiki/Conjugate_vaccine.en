A '''conjugate vaccine''' is created by covalently attaching a poor (polysaccharide organism) [[antigen]] to a [[carrier protein]] (preferably from the same microorganism), thereby conferring the immunological attributes of the carrier on the attached antigen.  This technique for the creation of an effective immunogen is most often applied to bacterial [[polysaccharide]]s for the prevention of invasive bacterial disease.
