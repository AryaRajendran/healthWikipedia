'''Personalized medicine''' or '''PM''' is a [[medical model]] that proposes the customization of healthcare - with medical decisions, practices, and/or products being tailored to the individual patient. The use of genetic information has played a major role in certain aspects of personalized medicine, and the term was even first coined in the context of genetics (though it has since broadened to encompass all sorts of personalization measures). To distinguish from the sense in which medicine has always been inherently "personal" to each patient, '''PM''' commonly denotes the use of some kind of technology or discovery enabling a level of personalization not previously feasible or practical.

==Background==
Traditional clinical diagnosis and management focuses on the individual patient's [[Medical sign|clinical signs]] and symptoms, medical and family history, and data from laboratory and imaging evaluation to diagnose and treat illnesses. This is often a reactive approach to treatment, i.e., treatment/medication starts after the signs and symptoms appear.

Advances in [[medical genetics]] and [[human genetics]] have enabled a more detailed understanding of the impact of genetics in disease.  Large collaborative research projects (for example, the [[Human genome project]]) have laid the groundwork for the understanding of the roles of genes in normal [[Human development (biology)|human development]] and physiology, revealed [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) that account for some of the [[genetic variability]] between individuals, and made possible the use of [[Genome-wide association study|genome-wide association studies (GWAS)]] to examine genetic variation and risk for many common diseases.

Historically, the [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical industry]] has developed medications based on empiric observations and more recently, known disease mechanisms. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} For example, [[antibiotics]] were based on the observation that [[microbes]] produce substances that inhibit other species.  Agents that lower [[blood pressure]] have typically been designed to act on certain pathways involved in [[hypertension]] (such as renal salt and water absorption, vascular contractility, and [[cardiac output]]).  Medications for [[hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]] target the absorption, [[metabolism]], and generation of cholesterol.  Treatments for [[diabetes]] are aimed at improving insulin release from the pancreas and sensitivity of the muscle and fat tissues to insulin action.  Thus, medications are developed based on mechanisms of disease that have been extensively studied over the past century.  It is hoped that recent advancements in the genetic etiologies of common diseases will improve pharmaceutical development.

==Potential applications (note that these may overlap)==

===Pharmacogenetics, proteomics, and metabolomics===

Since the late 1990s, the advent of research using [[biobanks]] has brought advances in [[molecular biology]], [[proteomics]], [[metabolomic]] analysis, [[genetic testing]], and [[molecular medicine]]. Another significant development has been the notion of [[companion diagnostics]], whereby molecular [[assays]] that measure levels of proteins, genes, or specific mutations are used to provide a specific therapy for an individual's condition - by ''stratifying'' disease status, selecting the proper [[medication]], and tailoring [[Dose (biochemistry)|dosages]] to that patient's specific needs.  Additionally, such methods might be used to assess a patient's [[risk factor]] for a number of conditions and tailor individual [[Preventative medicine|preventative treatments]] such as [[nutritional immunology]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} approaches.

[[Pharmacogenetics]] (also termed pharmacogenomics) is the field of study that examines the impact of [[Genetic diversity|genetic variation]] and drug responses by [[biomarker (medicine)]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shastry BS |title=Pharmacogenetics and the concept of individualized medicine |journal=Pharmacogenomics J. |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=16–21 |year=2006 |pmid=16302022 |doi=10.1038/sj.tpj.6500338 |url=}}</ref>  This approach is aimed at tailoring [[Pharmacology|drug therapy]] at a dosage that is most appropriate for an individual patient, with the potential benefits of increasing the efficacy and safety of medications. Other benefits include reduced time, cost, and failure rates of clinical trials in the production of new drugs by using precise [[biomarkers (medicine)]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Galas, D. J., & Hood, L. |title=Systems Biology and Emerging Technologies Will Catalyze the Transition from Reactive Medicine to Predictive, Personalized, Preventive and Participatory (P4) Medicine |journal=Interdisciplinary Bio Central |volume=1 |pages=1–4|year=2009 |doi=10.4051/ibc.2009.2.0006 |url=}}</ref>  Gene-centered research may also speed the development of novel therapeutics.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shastry BS |title=Pharmacogenetics and the concept of individualized medicine |journal=Pharmacogenomics J. |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=16–21 |year=2006 |pmid=16302022 |doi=10.1038/sj.tpj.6500338 |url=}}</ref>

Some examples of pharmacogenetics include:
* Genotyping for SNPs in genes involved in the action and metabolism of [[warfarin]] (Coumadin).  This medication is used clinically as an anticoagulant but requires periodic monitoring and is associated with adverse side affects.  Recently, genetic variants in the gene encoding [[Cytochrome P450]] enzyme [[CYP2C9]], which metabolizes warfarin,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schwarz UI |title=Clinical relevance of genetic polymorphisms in the human CYP2C9 gene |journal=Eur.

* Genotyping variants in genes encoding Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2D6, [[CYP2C19]], and CYP2C9), which metabolize neuroleptic medications, to improve drug response and reduce [[Side effect|side-effects]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cichon S, Nöthen MM, Rietschel M, Propping P |title=Pharmacogenetics of schizophrenia |journal=Am.

The field of [[proteomics]], or the comprehensive analysis and characterization of all of the proteins and [[protein isoform]]s encoded by the [[human genome]], may eventually have a significant impact on medicine. This is because while the DNA genome<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=personal-genome-sequencing&print=true |title=Genome Sequencing for the Rest of Us |publisher=Scientific American |date= 2010-06-28 |accessdate=2010-08-13 | first=Katherine | last=Harmon}}</ref> is the information archive, it is the proteins that do the work of the cell: the functional aspects of the cell are controlled by and through proteins, not genes.

Important biological functions: growth, death, cellular movement and localization, differentiation, etc. are controlled by a process called [[signal transduction]]. This process is nearly entirely epi-genetic and governed by protein [[enzyme activity]]. Diseases such as cancer, while based on genomic mutations, are functionally manifest as dysfunctional protein signal transduction. Pharmaceutical interventions aim to modulate the aberrant protein activity, not [[Genetic disorder|genetic defect]]. Comparative analysis of [[gene expression]] and [[protein expression]] have largely found little concordance between the two information archives{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}, thus some scientists now feel a direct analysis of the proteome may be required. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}.

It has also been demonstrated that pre-dose [[metabolomics|metabolic profiles]] from urine can be used to predict drug metabolism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clayton TA, Lindon JC, Cloarec O, ''et al.'' |title=Pharmaco-metabonomic phenotyping and personalized drug treatment |journal=Nature |volume=440 |issue=7087 |pages=1073–7 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16625200 |doi=10.1038/nature04648 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Clayton TA, Baker D, Lindon JC, Everett JR, Nicholson JK |title=Pharmacometabonomic identification of a significant host-microbiome metabolic interaction affecting human drug metabolism |journal=Proc.

===Cancer management===
[[Oncology]] is a field of medicine with a long history of classifying tumor stages and subtypes based on anatomic and pathologic findings.  This approach includes histological examination of tumor specimens from individual patients (such as HER2/NEU in [[breast cancer]]) to look for markers associated with prognosis and likely treatment responses.  Thus, "personalized medicine" was in practice long before the term was coined.  New molecular testing methods have enabled an extension of this approach to include testing for global gene, protein, and protein pathway activation expression profiles and/or somatic mutations in [[Cancer|cancer cells]] from patients in order to better define the prognosis in these patients and to suggest treatment options that are most likely to succeed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mansour JC, Schwarz RE |title=Molecular mechanisms for individualized cancer care |journal=J. Am. Coll. Surg. |volume=207 |issue=2 |pages=250–8 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18656055 |doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2008.03.003 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=van't Veer LJ, Bernards R |title=Enabling personalized cancer medicine through analysis of gene-expression patterns |journal=Nature |volume=452 |issue=7187 |pages=564–70 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18385730 |doi=10.1038/nature06915 |url=}}</ref>

[[Cancer genetics]] is a specialized field of [[medical genetics]] that is concerned with hereditary cancer risk.  Currently, there are a small number of cancer predisposition syndromes in which an [[allele]] segregates in an [[autosomal dominant]] fashion, leading to significantly elevated risk for certain cancers.  It is estimated that familial cancer accounts for about 5-10% of all cancers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}  However, other genetic variants with more subtle effects on individual cancer risk may enable more precise cancer risk assessment in individuals without a strong family history. 

Examples of personalized cancer management include:
* Testing for disease-causing mutations in the ''BRCA1'' and ''BRCA2'' genes, which are implicated in [[hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndrome]]s.  Discovery of a disease-causing mutation in a family can inform "at-risk" individuals as to whether they are at higher risk for cancer and may prompt individualized prophylactic therapy including [[mastectomy]] and [[oophorectomy|removal of the ovaries]]. This testing involves complicated personal decisions and is undertaken in the context of detailed [[genetic counseling]]. More detailed molecular stratification of breast tumors may pave the way for future tailored treatments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-17740690 |title=Breast cancer rules rewritten in 'landmark' study |author=Gallagher, James |date=19 April 2012 |work=BBC News |publisher= |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>  

* Minimal residual disease (MRD) tests are used to quantify residual cancer, enabling detection of [[tumor marker]]s before physical signs and symptoms return. This assists physicians in making clinical decisions sooner than previously possible.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

* '''Targeted therapy''' is the use of medications designed to target aberrant molecular pathways in a subset of patients with a given cancer type.  For example, [[trastuzumab]] (marketed as Herceptin) is used in the treatment of women with breast cancer in which [[HER2]] protein is overexpressed.  [[Tyrosine kinase]] inhibitors such as [[imatinib]] (marketed as Gleevec) have been developed to treat [[chronic myeloid leukemia]] (CML), in which the [[Philadelphia chromosome|BCR-ABL]] [[fusion gene]] (the product of a [[Chromosomal translocation|reciprocal translocation]] between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22) is present in >95% of cases and produces hyperactivated abl-driven protein signaling.  These medications specifically inhibit the Ableson tyrosine kinase (ABL) protein and are thus a prime example of "'''rational drug design'''" based on knowledge of disease pathophysiology.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Saglio G, Morotti A, Mattioli G, ''et al.'' |title=Rational approaches to the design of therapeutics targeting molecular markers: the case of chronic myelogenous leukemia |journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. |volume=1028 |issue= 1|pages=423–31 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15650267 |doi=10.1196/annals.1322.050 |url=}}</ref>

===Customized drug products (in general)===
In general, physicians have wide discretion to prescribe '''customized drug products''' containing one or more drug substances in particular respective doses, and/or specific excipients or formulations for such products, specifically for individual patients. These prescriptions can then be custom-produced in a [[compounding pharmacy]]. In addition to such customized drug products themselves being a form of personalized medicine (a form that, ironically, was more common before most drugs began being mass-produced; although as noted below new tools and technologies are rekindling this aspect of PM), there can also now be a ''pharmacogenomic'' aspect to this traditional practice (to the extent a given patient's genomics might be a factor in informing such as prescription, ''along with other'' individualized considerations such as weight, age, condition severity, etc.). 

For ''oral'' (ingested) dosage forms, some kinds or compositions of pills or [[polypill]]s are more amenable to custom-compounding than others, and most retail pharmacies no longer offer compounding services (although hospital pharmacies still commonly compound ''intravenous'' medications). But while fewer pharmacists are trained and experienced in the relevant skills anymore, such compounding pharmacies nevertheless can be found and utilized via mail-order (if not available locally) with sufficient notice and planning.<ref>"5-in-1 PolyPill Treatment May Prevent Heart Disease". Bayviewrx.com. 2009-04-01. Retrieved 2012-02-05.</ref> Generally, if a customized drug product is produced for a specific patient in response to a prescription specifying said patient's drug(s)/dosage(s), it is not subject to regulatory approval (e.g., FDA in the US) but is instead regulated under the practice of pharmacy (governed at the state-level in the US).

Technologies are under development to facilitate production of customized polypills, such as for example by the use of ink-jet printing mechanisms to precisely deposit selected drug substance(s) onto sheets which can then be inserted into capsules (enabling "individualized dosing and automated fabrication of medicines containing multiple drugs," in addition to custom single-drug products).<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21360709</ref> Similar technology can also be used to print tablets, more directly. Ink-jet or fluid-jet approaches do require each drug substance to be dissolved in a liquid solvent, but they can be particularly conducive to custom formulation with various possible excipients (in addition to custom drug/dose selections).

==Notable concerns and opportunities==

*One of the significant barriers to genetic testing is thought to be the fear of discrimination, such as from an insurer or employer, as the data could be used in much the same way any other actuarial statistics are processed (the term "discrimination" has a connotation of illegitimacy, suggesting policy objections to treating genetic information the same way as other actuarial data). The [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]], was signed by president George W. Bush in 2008, which despite certain exemptions may alleviate a barrier in the US to widespread use of genetic testing (and thus associated forms of personalized medicine).

*Some technologies underpinning personalized medicine could enable the pharmaceutical industry to develop a more efficient drug development process, based on the latest research on disease pathophysiology and genetic [[risk factors]].  Furthermore, a therapeutic agent could be marketed on the basis of a companion [[theranostic]] test result.

*The advent of new molecular diagnostic tests may open opportunities for using molecular blood fingerprint panels with health and disease states in patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Galas, D. J., & Hood, L. |title=Systems Biology and Emerging Technologies Will Catalyze the Transition from Reactive Medicine to Predictive, Personalized, Preventive and Participatory (P4) Medicine |journal=Interdisciplinary Bio Central |volume=1 |pages=1–4|year=2009 |doi=10.4051/ibc.2009.2.0006 |url=}}</ref>

*There is little evidence that diagnostics companies are embracing partnerships with pharma companies to develop [[theranostics]]. The development risk and [[time to market]] associated with drug candidates make the prospect of developing a ''companion diagnostic'' significantly less attractive to major diagnostics manufacturers than the revenues they generate from their traditional target market of clinical laboratories.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pgxnews.org/web/press-releases/82-dxs-collaborates-with-astrazeneca-to-provide-a-companion-diagnostic-for-iressa | title=DxS Collaborates with AstraZeneca to Provide a Companion Diagnostic for IRESSA | author=PGxNews.Org| publisher=PGxNews.Org| accessdate=2009-07-31| month=July | year=2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><sup>dead link</sup>

*Personalized medicine can raise new issues for those who pay for treatment. The cost of ''new diagnostic tests'' and ''individualized medications'' may be more expensive, but the predictive potential of personalized medicine could avert more costly treatments required after the onset of a disease.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Insurance premiums today are based on actuarial statistics that apply to large, predictable populations. By contrast, personalized medicine targets small populations, which are far less stable and predictable from an actuarial standpoint. Payers would need to develop new actuarial assumptions on which to base their reimbursement models.   Personalized medicine has the potential to reduce payers’ costs in the long term by providing the precise diagnostics required to avoid unnecessary or ineffective treatments, prevent adverse events, develop prevention strategies, and deliver more effective, targeted therapeutics. A trend towards pay for performance could accelerate the adoption of personalized medicine, if clinical data shows that targeted diagnostics and therapies reduce payers’ costs.

*For healthcare providers, personalized medicine offers the potential to improve the quality of care through more precise diagnostics, better therapies, and access to more accurate and up-to-date patient data. Primary care providers may have to build new service lines around prevention and wellness in order to replace revenues lost from traditional medical procedures. Physicians will also require a solid background in genomics and proteomics to make the best use of new data.

*The ''Genomics and Personalized Medicine Act'' was introduced in the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] to address scientific barriers, adverse market pressures, and regulatory obstacles.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s109-3822 | title=Genomics and Personalized Medicine Act of 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-976 | title=Genomics and Personalized Medicine Act of 2007}}</ref>
In addition, [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services]] [[Mike Leavitt]] created a committee known as the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetics Health and Society ([http://www4.od.nih.gov/oba/sacghs.htm SACGHS]) to study issues related to personalized medicine.

==Education==
There are several universities increasing their focus on personalized medicine and certain related areas. One difficulty is that [[medical education]] in all countries does not provide adequate genetic instruction.

Some universities are developing relevant sub-specialties of medicine for personalized medicine, which depending on the emphasis can also be termed [[molecular medicine]] or even prospective medicine. These include, [[Duke University]], [[Harvard]], The [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]] in [[New York City]]. A [[medical school]] is currently being constructed in [[Arizona]], to teach the field of personalized medicine; this is a project of [[Arizona State University]] and the [[not-for-profit]] Translational Genomics Research Institute ([[TGen]]). Lastly, the first private medical practice focusing solely on Personalized Medicine, Helix Health of Connecticut, is currently teaching medical residents about the utility of pharmacogenomics and family history in personalized medicine.
