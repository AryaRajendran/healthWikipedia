'''Spinal manipulation''' is a therapeutic intervention performed on spinal articulations which are [[synovial joints]]. These articulations in the spine that are amenable to spinal manipulative therapy include the [[zygapophysial|z-joints]], the  [[atlanto-occipital joint|atlanto-occipital]], [[atlanto-axial joint|atlanto-axial]], [[Vertebral column#Lumbar|lumbosacral]], [[sacroiliac joint|sacroiliac]], [[costotransverse joint|costotransverse]] and [[costovertebral joints|costovertebral]] joints.  
National guidelines come to different conclusions with  respect to spinal manipulation with some not recommending it, some describing manipulation as optional, and others recommending a short course in those who do not improve with other treatments.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Koes|first=BW|coauthors=van Tulder, M; Lin, CW; Macedo, LG; McAuley, J; Maher, C|title=An updated overview of clinical guidelines for the management of non-specific low back pain in primary care.|journal=European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society|date=2010 Dec|volume=19|issue=12|pages=2075-94|pmid=20602122}}</ref>

== History ==
Spinal manipulation is a therapeutic intervention that has roots in [[traditional medicine]] and has been used by various cultures, apparently for thousands of years. [[Hippocrates]], the "father of medicine" used manipulative techniques,<ref name=Swedlo>Dean C. Swedlo, "[http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2002.pdf The Historical Development of Chiropractic.]" pp. 55-58, ''The Proceedings of the 11th Annual History of Medicine Days'', Faculty of Medicine, The University of Calgary</ref> as did the ancient Egyptians and many other cultures.<ref name=Burke>Burke, G.L., "[http://www.macdonaldpublishing.com Backache from Occiput to Coccyx]" Chapter 1</ref> A modern re-emphasis on [[manipulative therapy]] occurred in the late 19th century in North America with the emergence of [[osteopathic]] and [[chiropractic]] medicine.<ref name=Keating-pathways>{{cite journal |journal= J Manipulative Physiol Ther |year=2003 |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=300–21 |title= Several pathways in the evolution of chiropractic manipulation |author= Keating JC Jr |doi=10.1016/S0161-4754(02)54125-7 |pmid=12819626}}</ref> Spinal manipulative therapy gained recognition by mainstream medicine during the 1960s.<ref name=Burke2>Burke, G.L., "[http://www.macdonaldpublishing.com/Chapter_7.html Backache from Occiput to Coccyx]" Chapter 7</ref><ref name="titleInternational MUA Academy of Physicians - Historical Considerations">{{cite web |url=http://www.muaphysicians.com/historical.html |title=International MUA Academy of Physicians - Historical Considerations |accessdate=2008-03-24 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=}}</ref>

== Current providers ==
Spinal manipulation is now most commonly provided various health care disciplines. In [[North America]], it is most commonly performed by [[chiropractor]]s, [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|osteopathic physicians]], [[occupational therapists]] and [[physical therapist]]s. In [[Europe]], [[chiropractors]], [[osteopaths]] and [[physiotherapists]] are the majority providers, although the precise figure varies between countries.

== Terminology ==
Manipulation is known by several other names. The British orthopaedic surgeon [[Arthur Bankart|A. S. Blundell Bankart]] used the term "manipulation" in his text ''Manipulative Surgery''.<ref>  A. S. Blundell Bankart. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bjs.1800207825/abstract Manipulative surgery]. 1932. London: Constable & Co.</ref> Chiropractors often refer to manipulation of a spinal joint as an '[[spinal adjustment|adjustment]]'. Following the labelling system developed by Geoffery Maitland,<ref>Maitland, G.D. ''Peripheral Manipulation'' 2nd ed. Butterworths, London, 1977.<br>
Maitland, G.D. ''Vertebral Manipulation'' 5th ed. Butterworths, London, 1986.</ref> manipulation is synonymous with Grade V [[joint mobilization|mobilization]]. Because of its distinct biomechanics (see section below), the term [[high velocity low amplitude thrust|high velocity low amplitude]] (HVLA) thrust is often used interchangeably with manipulation.

== Biomechanics ==
Spinal manipulation can be distinguished from other [[manual therapy]] interventions such as [[joint mobilization|mobilization]] by its [[biomechanics]], both [[Dynamics (physics)|kinetics]] and [[kinematics]].

=== Kinetics ===
Until recently, force-time histories measured during spinal manipulation were described as consisting of three distinct phases: the preload (or prethrust) phase, the thrust phase, and the resolution phase{{Technical-statement|date=July 2011}}.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Herzog W, Symons B. | title = The biomechanics of spinal manipulation. | journal = Crit Rev Phys Rehabil Med | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 191–216 | year = 2001}}</ref> Evans and Breen<ref>{{cite journal | author = Evans DW, Breen AC. | title = A biomechanical model for mechanically efficient cavitation production during spinal manipulation: prethrust position and the neutral zone. | journal = J Manipulative Physiol Ther | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 72–82 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16396734 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmpt.2005.11.011}}</ref> added a fourth ‘orientation’ phase to describe the period during which the patient is [[orientation (geometry)|orientated]] into the appropriate position in preparation for the prethrust phase.

=== Kinematics ===
The [[kinematics]] of a complete [[functional spinal unit|spinal motion segment]], when one of its constituent spinal joints is manipulated, are much more complex than the kinematics that occur during manipulation of an independent peripheral [[synovial joint]].

== Suggested mechanisms of action and clinical effects ==
The effects of spinal manipulation have been shown to include:

* Temporary relief of musculoskeletal [[pain]]

* Shortened time to recover from [[acute (medical)|acute]] [[back pain]]

* Temporary increase in passive range of motion (ROM)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nilsson N, Christensen H, Hartvigsen J | title = Lasting changes in passive range motion after spinal manipulation: a randomized, blind, controlled trial. | journal = J Manipulative Physiol Ther | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 165–8 | year = 1996| pmid = 8728459}}</ref>

* Altered sensorimotor integration<ref>[http://www.jmptonline.org/article/S0161-4754(07)00344-2/abstract Elsevier]</ref>

Common [[adverse effect|side effect]]s of spinal manipulation are characterized as mild to moderate and may include: local discomfort, headache, tiredness, or radiating discomfort.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Senstad O, Leboeuf-Yde C, Borchgrevink C |title=Frequency and characteristics of side effects of spinal manipulative therapy (Adverse) |journal=Spine |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=435–40; discussion 440–1 |year=1997 |month=February |pmid=9055373 |doi= 10.1097/00007632-199702150-00017|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0362-2436&volume=22&issue=4&spage=435}}</ref>

== Effectiveness ==
=== Back pain ===

A 2004 [[Cochrane review]] found that spinal manipulation (SM) was no more or less effective than other commonly used therapies such as [[pain medication]], [[physical therapy]], exercises, back school or the care given by a general practitioner.<ref name=Cochrane04>{{cite journal |last= Assendelft|first= WJJ|coauthors= Morton, SC; Yu, EI; Suttorp, MJ; Shekelle, PG|year= 2004|title= Spinal manipulative therapy for low-back pain|journal= [[Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews]]|volume= 2004|issue= 1|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD000447.pub2|id= Art.

== Safety ==
{{see also|Spinal adjustment#Safety}}

As with all interventions, there are risks associated with spinal manipulation. Infrequent, but potentially serious side effects, include: vertebrobasilar accidents (VBA), [[stroke]]s, [[death]], [[spinal disc herniation]], [[vertebral]] and [[rib]] [[bone fracture|fracture]]s, and [[cauda equina syndrome]].<ref>[http://www.spinejournal.com/pt/re/spine/abstract.00007632-199702150-00017.htm;jsessionid=FH9Bf7CrSQgjsWn2H8t45y8QJp9zmTyWRddxKvBbhCb1tQjJnQNX!1408571515!-949856144!8091!-1 Frequency and Characteristics of Side Effects of Spinal Manipulative Therapy.

In a 1993 study, J.D. Cassidy, DC, and co-workers concluded that the treatment of lumbar intervertebral disk herniation by side posture manipulation is "both safe and effective."<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cassidy JD, Thiel H, Kirkaldy-Willis W | title = Side posture manipulation for lumbar intervertebral disk herniation | journal = J Manip Physiol Ther | volume = 16 | pages = 96–103 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8445360 | issue = 2}}</ref>

=== Risks of upper cervical manipulation ===

The degree of serious [[risk]]s associated with [[cervical manipulation|manipulation of the cervical spine]] is uncertain, with widely differing results being published.

A 1996 Danish chiropractic study confirmed the risk of stroke to be low, and determined that the greatest risk is with manipulation of the first two vertebra of the cervical spine, particularly passive [[rotation]] of the neck, known as the "master cervical" or "rotary break."<ref>{{cite journal | author = Klougart N, Leboeuf-Yde C, Rasmussen L | title = Safety in chiropractic practice, Part I; The occurrence of cerebrovascular accidents after manipulation to the neck in Denmark from 1978-1988 | journal = J Manip Physiol Ther | volume = 19 |  pages = 371–7 | year = 1996| pmid = 8864967 | issue = 6}}</ref>

Serious complications after manipulation of the cervical spine are estimated to be 1 in 4 million manipulations or fewer.<ref>Lauretti W "What are the risk of chiropractic neck treatments?" retrieved online 08 028 2006 from [http://www.chiro.org/chimages/chiropage/cva-1.html www.chiro.org]</ref> A [[RAND]] Corporation extensive review estimated "one in a million."<ref name="Coulter">Coulter ID, Hurwitz EL, Adams AH, ''et al.''

Understandably, vascular accidents are responsible for the major criticism of spinal manipulative therapy. However, it has been pointed out that "critics of manipulative therapy emphasize the possibility of serious injury, especially at the brain stem, due to arterial trauma after cervical manipulation. It has required only the very rare reporting of these accidents to malign a therapeutic procedure that, in experienced hands, gives beneficial results with few adverse side effects".<ref>Kleynhans AM, Terrett AG.

[[Edzard Ernst]] has written:

:"...there is little evidence to demonstrate that spinal manipulation has any specific therapeutic effects. On the other hand, there is convincing evidence to show that it is associated with frequent, mild [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]] as well as with serious complications of unknown incidence. Therefore, it seems debatable whether the benefits of spinal manipulation outweigh its risks. Specific risk factors for vascular accidents related to spinal manipulation have not been identified, which means that any patient may be at risk, particularly those below 45 years of age. Definitive, prospective studies that can overcome the limitations of previous investigations are now a matter of urgency. Until they are available, clinicians might tell their patients to adopt a cautious approach and avoid the type of spinal manipulation for which the risk seems greatest: forceful manipulation of the upper spine with a rotational element."<ref name="ernst_safety"/>

In a 2007 followup report in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, Ernst concluded: "Spinal manipulation, particularly when performed on the upper spine, is frequently associated with mild to moderate adverse effects. It can also result in serious complications such as vertebral artery dissection followed by stroke. Currently, the incidence of such events is not known. In the interest of patient safety we should reconsider our policy towards the routine use of spinal manipulation."<ref>[http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/content/full/100/7/330?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&author1=ernst,+edzard&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&resourcetype=HWCIT Adverse effects of spinal manipulation: a systematic review - Ernst 100 (7)  330 - Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]</ref>

=== Potential for incident underreporting ===

Statistics on the reliability of incident reporting for injuries related to manipulation of the cervical spine vary. The [[RAND]] study assumed that only 1 in 10 cases would have been reported. However, [[Edzard Ernst|Prof Ernst]] surveyed neurologists in Britain for cases of serious neurological complications occurring within 24 hours of cervical spinal manipulation by various types of practitioners; 35 cases had been seen by the 24 neurologists who responded, but none of the cases had been reported. He concluded that underreporting was close to 100%, rendering estimates "nonsensical." He therefore suggested that ''"clinicians might tell their patients to adopt a cautious approach and avoid the type of spinal manipulation for which the risk seems greatest: forceful manipulation of the upper spine with a rotational element."''<ref name="ernst_safety">[http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/166/1/40 Spinal manipulation: Its safety is uncertain]. Edzard Ernst, ''CMAJ'', January 8, 2002; 166 (1)</ref>  The NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination stated that the survey had methodological problems with data collection.<ref name = "NHS Chiro Maim">[http://www.nelh.nhs.uk/hth/chiro.asp NHS Evaluation of the evidence base for the adverse effects of spinal manipulation by chiropractors]</ref> Both NHS and Ernst noted that bias is a problem with the survey method of data collection.

A 2001 study in the journal ''Stroke'' found that vertebrobasilar accidents (VBAs) were five times more likely in those aged less than 45 years who had visited a chiropractor in the preceding week, compared to controls who had not visited a chiropractor. No significant associations were found for those over 45 years. The authors concluded: ''"While our analysis is consistent with a positive association in young adults... The rarity of VBAs makes this association difficult to study despite high volumes of chiropractic treatment."''<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rothwell D, Bondy S, Williams J | title = Chiropractic manipulation and stroke: a population-based case-control study | journal = Stroke | volume = 32 | pages = 1054–60 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11340209 | issue = 5 | doi = 10.1161/01.STR.32.5.1054}} Original [http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/32/5/1054 article]</ref> The NHS notes that this study collected data objectively by using administrative data, involving less recall bias than survey studies, but the data were collected retrospectively and probably contained inaccuracies.<ref name = "NHS Chiro Maim"/>

In 1996, Coulter ''et al.''<ref name ="Coulter"/> had a multidisciplinary group of 4 MDs, 4 DCs and 1 MD/DC look at 736 conditions where it was used. Their job was to evaluate the appropriateness of manipulation or mobilization of the cervical spine in those cases (including a few cases not performed by chiropractors).

: "According to the report ... 57.6% of reported indications for cervical manipulation was considered inappropriate, with 31.3% uncertain. Only 11.1% could be labeled appropriate. A panel of chiropractors and medical practitioners concluded that '. . . much additional scientific data about the efficacy of cervical spine manipulation are needed.'"<ref name="Finding">[http://archfami.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/7/1/20 Finding A Good Chiropractor.] Samuel Homola, DC. ''Arch Fam Med.'' 1998;7:20-23.</ref>

=== Misattribution problems ===

Studies of stroke and manipulation do not always clearly identify what professional has performed the manipulation. In some cases this has led to confusion and improper placement of blame. In a 1995 study, chiropractic researcher Allan Terrett, DC, pointed to this problem:

:"The words chiropractic and chiropractor have been incorrectly used in numerous publications dealing with SMT injury by medical authors, respected medical journals and medical organizations. In many cases, this is not accidental; the authors had access to original reports that identified the practitioner involved as a nonchiropractor. The true incidence of such reporting cannot be determined. Such reporting adversely affects the reader's opinion of chiropractic and chiropractors."<ref name="Terrett">{{cite journal | author = Terrett A | title = Misuse of the literature by medical authors in discussing spinal manipulative therapy injury | journal = J Manipulative Physiol Ther | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 203–10 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7636409}}</ref>

This error was taken into account in a 1999 review<ref name="Di Fabio">{{cite journal | author = Di Fabio R | title = Manipulation of the cervical spine: risks and benefits | journal = Phys Ther | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 50–65 | year = 1999 | pmid = 9920191 | url = http://ptjournal.apta.org/content/79/1/50.full | accessdate=2011-11-24}}</ref> of the scientific literature on the risks and benefits of manipulation of the cervical spine (MCS). Special care was taken, whenever possible, to correctly identify all the professions involved, as well as the type of manipulation responsible for any injuries and/or deaths. It analyzed 177 cases that were reported in 116 articles published between 1925 and 1997, and summarized:

: "The most frequently reported injuries involved arterial dissection or spasm, and lesions of the brain stem. Death occurred in 32 (18%) of the cases. Physical therapists were involved in less than 2% of the cases, and no deaths have been attributed to MCS provided by physical therapists. Although the risk of injury associated with MCS appears to be small, this type of therapy has the potential to expose patients to vertebral artery damage that can be avoided with the use of mobilization (nonthrust passive movements)."<ref name="Di Fabio"/>

In Figure 1 in the review, the types of injuries attributed to manipulation of the cervical spine are shown,<ref>[http://www.ptjournal.org/cgi/content/full/79/1/50/F1 Figure 1. Injuries attributed to manipulation of the cervical spine.]</ref> and Figure 2 shows the type of practitioner involved in the resulting injury.<ref>[http://www.ptjournal.org/cgi/content/full/79/1/50/F2 Figure 2. Practitioners providing manipulation of the cervical spine that resulted in injury.]</ref> For the purpose of comparison, the type of practitioner was adjusted according to the findings by Terrett.<ref name="Terrett"/>

The review concluded:

: "The literature does not demonstrate that the benefits of MCS outweigh the risks. Several recommendations for future studies and for the practice of MCS are discussed."<ref name="Di Fabio"/>

== Emergency medicine ==

In [[emergency medicine]] joint manipulation can also refer to the process of bringing fragments of [[Fracture (bone)|fractured]] bone or [[dislocation (medicine)|dislocated]] joints into normal [[Anatomy|anatomical]] alignment (otherwise known as 'reducing' the fracture or dislocation). These procedures have no relation to the HVLA thrust procedure.
