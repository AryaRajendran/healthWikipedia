A '''Spigelian hernia''' (or '''lateral ventral hernia''') is a [[hernia]] through the spigelian [[fascia]], which is the [[aponeurotic]] layer between the [[rectus abdominis muscle]] medially, and the [[linea semilunaris|semilunar line]] laterally. These hernias almost always develop at or below the [[Arcuate line (anterior abdominal wall)|linea arcuata]], probably because of the lack of posterior rectus sheath. These are generally interparietal hernias, meaning that they do not lie below the [[subcutaneous]] fat but penetrate between the muscles of the [[abdominal wall]]; therefore, there is often no notable swelling.

Spigelian hernias are usually small and therefore risk of [[Strangulating|strangulation]] is high. Most occur on the right side. (4th–7th decade of life). Compared to other types of hernias they are rare.<ref name=larson>{{cite journal |author=Larson DW, Farley DR |title=Spigelian hernias: repair and outcome for 81 patients |journal=World journal of surgery |volume=26 |issue=10 |pages=1277–81 |year=2002 |pmid=12205553 |doi=10.1007/s00268-002-6605-0}}</ref>

==Symptoms and diagnosis==
Patients typically present with either an intermittent mass, localized pain, or signs of [[bowel obstruction]].<ref name=larson/> [[Ultrasonography]] or a [[CT scan]] can establish the diagnosis, although CT scan provides the greatest sensitivity and specificity.<ref name="Bittner">{{cite journal |author=Bittner JG, Edwards MA, Shah MB, MacFadyen BV, Mellinger JD |title=Mesh-free laparoscopic spigelian hernia repair |journal=Am Surg |volume=74 |issue=8 |pages=713–20; discussion 720 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18705572 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&issn=0003-1348&volume=74&issue=8&spage=713&aulast=Bittner%20JG}}</ref>

==Treatment==
These hernias should be repaired because of the high risk of strangulation;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vos DI, Scheltinga MR |title=Incidence and outcome of surgical repair of spigelian hernia |journal=The British journal of surgery |volume=91 |issue=5 |pages=640–4 |year=2004 |pmid=15122618 |doi=10.1002/bjs.4524}}</ref> fortunately, surgery is straightforward, with only larger defects requiring a [[mesh prosthesis]]. Varied Spigelian hernia mesh repair techniques have been described, although evidence suggests laparoscopy results in less morbidity and shorter hospitalization compared with open procedures. Mesh-free laparoscopic suture repair is feasible and safe. This novel uncomplicated approach to small Spigelian hernias combines the benefits of laparoscopic localization, reduction, and closure without the morbidity and cost associated with foreign material.<ref name="Bittner" />

==Eponym==
[[Adriaan van den Spiegel]], a [[surgeon]]-[[anatomist]] born in [[Brussels]], described this hernia. The first publication  was in 1645, twenty years after Spiegel's death.
