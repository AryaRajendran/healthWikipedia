It is largely seen in children under five years of age. It affects many organ systems, mainly those including the [[blood vessel]]s, [[skin]], [[mucous membrane]]s, and [[lymph node]]s; however its rare but most serious effect is on the [[heart]] where it can cause fatal [[coronary artery aneurysm]]s in untreated children. Without treatment, mortality may approach 1%, usually within six weeks of onset. With treatment, the mortality rate is less than 0.01% in the U.S.<ref name=kdmerck>{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec19/ch286/ch286d.html |title=Merck Manual, Online edition: Kawasaki Disease |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}</ref>

== Classification ==

Other reported [[non-specific symptom]]s include [[cough]], [[rhinorrhea]], [[sputum]], [[vomiting]], [[headache]], and [[seizure]].<ref name="pmid21860641" />

The course of the disease can be divided into three clinical phases.<ref name="pmid19851663" /> The [[acute (medicine)|acute]] febrile phase, which usually lasts for 1 to 2 weeks, is characterized by fever, [[conjunctival injection]], erythema of the oral mucosa, erythema and swelling of the hands and feet, rash, cervical adenopathy, [[aseptic meningitis]], diarrhea, and [[hepatic dysfunction]].<ref name="pmid19851663" /> Myocarditis is common during this time, and a pericardial effusion may be present.<ref name="pmid9665974" /> [[arteritis|Coronary arteritis]] may be present, but [[aneurysms]] are generally not yet visible by [[echocardiography]].

[[Desquamation]] of the fingers and toes and [[thrombocytosis]] are seen during this stage, which generally lasts until about 4 weeks after the onset of fever. [[Coronary artery]] [[aneurysms]] usually develop during this time, and the risk for [[sudden cardiac death|sudden death]] is highest during this stage.<ref name="pmid9665974" /><ref name="pmid7264399">{{cite journal | author = Hirose O | title = [Two-dimensional echocardiography of coronary artery in Kawasaki disease (MCLS): detection, changes in acute phase, and follow-up observation of the aneurysm (author's transl)] | language = Japanese | journal = Journal of Cardiography | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 89–104 | year = 1981 | month = March | pmid = 7264399 | doi = | url = | author-separator = , | author2 = Misawa H | author3 = Kijima Y | display-authors = 3 | last4 = Yamada | first4 = O | last5 = Arakaki | first5 = Y | last6 = Kajino | first6 = Y | last7 = Ryujin | first7 = Y | last8 = Kowata | first8 = T | last9 = Echigo | first9 = S }}</ref> The [[convalescent]] stage begins when all clinical signs of illness have disappeared and continues until the [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate|sedimentation rate]] returns to normal, usually at 6 to 8 weeks after the onset of illness.<ref name="pmid19851663" />

There is differences in clinical presentation between [[adults]] and children, as adults have more affection of neck lymph nodes (93% of adults versus 15% of children); [[hepatitis]] (65% versus 10%), and [[arthralgia]] (61% versus 24-38%).<ref name="pmid19851663"/><ref name="pmid17443379">{{cite journal | author = Wolff AE, Hansen KE, Zakowski L | title = Acute Kawasaki Disease: Not Just for Kids | journal = [[Journal of General Internal Medicine]] | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 681–4 | year = 2007 | month = May | pmid = 17443379 | pmc = 1852903 | doi = 10.1007/s11606-006-0100-5 | url = }}</ref> Some patients have atypical presentations and may not have the classical symptoms and this occurs in particular in young [[infants]],<ref name="pmid3772656">{{cite journal | author = Burns JC | title = Clinical spectrum of Kawasaki disease in infants younger than 6 months of age | journal = [[The Journal of Pediatrics]] | volume = 109 | issue = 5 | pages = 759–63 | year = 1986 | month = November | pmid = 3772656 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-3476(86)80689-8| url = | author-separator = , | author2 = Wiggins JW | author3 = Toews WH | display-authors = 3 | last4 = Newburger | first4 = J | last5 = Leung | first5 = D | last6 = Wilson | first6 = H | last7 = Glode | first7 = M }}</ref> and those patients are especially at higher risk for [[cardiac artery aneurysms]].<ref name="pmid9665974" /><ref name="pmid1505575">{{cite journal | author = Boven K, De Graeff-Meeder ER, Spliet W, Kuis W | title = Atypical Kawasaki disease: an often missed diagnosis | journal = [[European Journal of Pediatrics]] | volume = 151 | issue = 8 | pages = 577–80 | year = 1992 | month = August | pmid = 1505575 | doi = 10.1007/BF01957725| url = }}</ref>

Kawasaki disease can only be diagnosed clinically (i.e. by [[medical sign]]s and [[symptom]]s). There exists no specific laboratory test for this condition. It is difficult to establish the diagnosis, especially early in the course of the illness, and frequently children are not diagnosed until they have seen several health care providers. Many other serious illnesses can cause similar symptoms, and must be considered in the [[differential diagnosis]], including [[scarlet fever]], [[toxic shock]] syndrome, [[juvenile idiopathic arthritis]], and childhood mercury poisoning ([[infantile acrodynia]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Classically, five days of fever<ref name="urlKawasaki Disease - June 1999 - American Academy of Family Physicians">{{cite web |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/990600ap/3093.html |title=Kawasaki Disease - June 1999 - American Academy of Family Physicians |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> plus four of five [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] criteria must be met in order to establish the diagnosis. The criteria are: (1) [[erythema]] of the lips or oral cavity or cracking of the lips; (2) rash on the trunk; (3) swelling or erythema of the hands or feet; (4) red eyes (conjunctival injection) (5) swollen lymph node in the neck of at least 15 millimeters.

Many children, especially infants, eventually diagnosed with Kawasaki disease do not exhibit all of the above criteria. In fact, many experts now recommend treating for Kawasaki disease even if only three days of fever have passed and at least three diagnostic criteria are present, especially if other tests reveal abnormalities consistent with Kawasaki disease. In addition, the diagnosis can be made purely by the detection of coronary artery aneurysms in the proper clinical setting.

=== Investigations ===
A physical examination will demonstrate many of the features listed above.

Blood tests
* [[Complete blood count]] (CBC) may reveal normocytic [[anemia]] and eventually [[thrombocytosis]]
* [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR) will be elevated
* [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP) will be elevated
* [[Liver function tests]] may show evidence of hepatic inflammation and low [[serum albumin]]

Other optional tests
* [[Electrocardiogram]] may show evidence of [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] dysfunction or, occasionally, [[arrhythmia]] due to [[myocarditis]]
* [[Echocardiogram]] may show subtle coronary artery changes or, later, true aneurysms.
* [[Ultrasound]] or [[computerized tomography]] may show hydrops (enlargement) of the [[gallbladder]]
* [[Urinalysis]] may show white blood cells and protein in the urine ([[pyuria]] and [[proteinuria]]) without evidence of bacterial growth
* [[Lumbar puncture]] may show evidence of [[aseptic meningitis]]
* [[Angiography]] was historically used to detect coronary artery aneurysms and remains the gold standard for their detection, but is rarely used today unless coronary artery aneurysms have already been detected by echocardiography.
* [[Temporal artery]] [[biopsy]]

== Treatment ==
Children with Kawasaki disease should be hospitalized and cared for by a physician who has experience with this disease. When in an academic medical center, care is often shared between pediatric [[cardiology]], pediatric rheumatology and pediatric [[infectious disease]] specialists (although no specific [[infectious agent]] has been identified as yet).<ref name="childrens" /> It is imperative that treatment be started as soon as the diagnosis is made to prevent damage to the [[coronary arteries]].

[[Intravenous immunoglobulin]] ([[IVIG]]) is the standard treatment for Kawasaki disease<ref name="pmid14584002">{{cite journal |author=Oates-Whitehead RM |title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD004000 |year=2003 |pmid=14584002 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004000 |chapter=Intravenous immunoglobulin for the treatment of Kawasaki disease in children |editor1-last=Baumer |editor1-first=J Harry |author-separator=, |author2=Baumer JH |author3=Haines L |display-authors=3 |last4=Love |first4=S |last5=MacOnochie |first5=IK |last6=Gupta |first6=A |last7=Roman |first7=K |last8=Dua |first8=JS |last9=Flynn |first9=I}}</ref> and is administered in high doses with marked improvement usually noted within 24 hours. If the fever does not respond, an additional dose may have to be considered. In rare cases, a third dose may be given to the child. IVIG by itself is most useful within the first seven days of onset of fever, in terms of preventing coronary artery aneurysm.

[[Salicylate]] therapy, particularly [[aspirin]], remains an important part of the treatment (though questioned by some)<ref name="pmid15545617">{{cite journal |author=Hsieh KS, Weng KP, Lin CC, Huang TC, Lee CL, Huang SM |title=Treatment of acute Kawasaki disease: aspirin's role in the febrile stage revisited |journal=Pediatrics |volume=114 |issue=6 |pages=e689–93 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15545617 |doi=10.1542/peds.2004-1037 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15545617}}</ref> but salicylates alone are not as effective as IVIG. Aspirin therapy is started at high doses until the fever subsides, and then is continued at a low dose when the patient returns home, usually for two months to prevent blood clots from forming. Except for Kawasaki disease and a few other indications, aspirin is otherwise normally not recommended for children due to its association with [[Reye's syndrome]]. Because children with Kawasaki disease will be taking aspirin for up to several months, vaccination against [[varicella]] and [[influenza]] is required, as these infections are most likely to cause Reye's syndrome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/804960-treatment |title=Pediatrics, Kawasaki Disease: Treatment & Medication - eMedicine Emergency Medicine |publisher=Emedicine.medscape.com |date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2010-05-19}}</ref> 

[[Corticosteroids]] have also been used,<ref name="pmid12838187">{{cite journal |author=Sundel RP, Baker AL, Fulton DR, Newburger JW |title=Corticosteroids in the initial treatment of Kawasaki disease: report of a randomized trial |journal=J.

In cases of Kawasaki disease refractory to IVIG, cyclophosphamide and plasma exchange have been investigated as possible treatments, with variable outcomes.
 
There are also treatments for iritis and other eye symptoms.
Another treatment may include the use of Infliximab (Remicade). Infliximab works by binding tumour necrosis factor alpha.<ref>[http://www.jnj.com/connect/NewsArchive/all-news-archive/20071106_141812 REMICADE® Becomes First Anti-TNF Biologic Therapy to Treat One Million Patients Worldwide]</ref>

== Prognosis ==
With early treatment, rapid recovery from the acute symptoms can be expected and the risk of coronary artery aneurysms greatly reduced. Untreated, the acute symptoms of Kawasaki disease are self-limited (''i.e.'' the patient will recover eventually), but the risk of coronary artery involvement is much greater. Overall, about 2% of patients die from complications of coronary vasculitis. Patients who have had Kawasaki disease should have an [[echocardiogram]] initially every few weeks, and then every one or two years to screen for progression of cardiac involvement.

Laboratory evidence of increased inflammation combined with demographic features (male sex, age less than six months or greater than eight years) and incomplete response to IVIG therapy create a profile of a high-risk patient with Kawasaki disease.<ref name="pmid3950818" /><ref name="pmid9605052">{{cite journal | author = Beiser AS, Takahashi M, Baker AL, Sundel RP, Newburger JW | title = A predictive instrument for coronary artery aneurysms in Kawasaki disease.

It is also not uncommon that a [[relapse]] of symptoms may occur soon after initial treatment with [[IVIG]]. This usually requires re-hospitalization and re-treatment. Treatment with [[IVIG]] can cause allergic and non-allergic acute reactions, aseptic meningitis, [[fluid overload]] and, rarely, other serious reactions. Overall, life-threatening complications resulting from therapy for Kawasaki disease are exceedingly rare, especially compared with the risk of non-treatment. There is also evidence that Kawasaki disease produces altered [[lipid metabolism]] that persists beyond clinical resolution of the disease.

== Epidemiology ==
Kawasaki disease affects boys more than girls with people of Asian ethnicity, particularly Japanese and Korean people are most susceptible as well as people of Afro-Caribbean ethnicity. The disease was rare in Caucasians until the last few decades and incidence rate fluctuates from country to country.

Currently, Kawasaki disease is the most commonly diagnosed pediatric vasculitis in the world.  By far the highest incidence of Kawasaki disease occurs in [[Japan]], with the most recent study placing the attack rate at 218.6 per 100,000 children <5 years of age (~1 in 450 children).  At this present attack rate, more than 1 in 150 children in Japan will develop Kawasaki disease during their lifetime.

However, its incidence in the [[United States]] is increasing. Kawasaki disease is predominantly a disease of young children, with 80% of patients younger than five years of age. Approximately 2,000-4,000 cases are identified in the United States each year.<ref name="childrens">{{cite web |url=http://www.childrenshospital.org/clinicalservices/Site468/mainpageS468P5.html |title=Who Kawasaki Disease Affects |accessdate=2009-01-04 |publisher=[[Children's Hospital Boston]]}}</ref><ref name="urlKawasaki Disease - Signs and Symptoms">{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsfchildrenshospital.org/conditions/kawasaki_disease/signs_and_symptoms.html |title=Kawasaki Disease - Signs and Symptoms |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> 

In the [[United Kingdom]], estimates of incidence rate vary because of the rarity of Kawasaki disease. However, Kawasaki disease is believed to affect fewer than 1 in every 25,000 people.<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC - Health: Kawasaki Disease |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/physical_health/conditions/kawasaki2.shtml |date=31 March 2009}}</ref> Incidence of the disease doubled from 1991 to 2000 however, with 4 cases in per 100,000 children in 1991 compared with a rise of 8 cases per 100,000 in 2000.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Rare heart disease rate doubles |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2043402.stm |publisher=BBC |date=17 June 2002}}</ref>

==History==

The disease was first reported by [[Tomisaku Kawasaki]] in a four-year-old child with a rash and fever at the Red Cross Hospital in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] in January 1961, and later published a report on 50 similar cases.<ref name="pmid6062087">{{cite journal | author = Kawasaki T | title = [Acute febrile mucocutaneous syndrome with lymphoid involvement with specific desquamation of the fingers and toes in children] | language = Japanese | journal = [[Arerugī = [Allergy]]] | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 178–222 | year = 1967 | month = March | pmid = 6062087 | doi = | url =  }}</ref> Later Kawasaki and colleagues were persuaded that there is definite cardiac involvement when they studied and reported 23 cases, of which 11(48%) patients had abnormalities detected by an [[electrocardiogram]].<ref>Yamamoto T, Oya T, Watanabe A, et al. Clinical features of Kawasaki disease [in Japanese] Shonika Rinsho (Jpn J Pediatr) 1968;21:291–297.</ref> It was not until 1974 that the first description of this disorder was published in the English language literature.<ref name="pmid4153258">{{cite journal | author = Kawasaki T, Kosaki F, Okawa S, Shigematsu I, Yanagawa H | title = A new infantile acute febrile mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (MLNS) prevailing in Japan | journal = [[Pediatrics]] | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 271–6 | year = 1974 | month = September | pmid = 4153258 | doi = | url =  }}</ref> in the year 1976 Melish et al., described the same illness in 16 children in Hawaii.<ref name="pmid7134">{{cite journal | author = Melish ME, Hicks RM, Larson EJ | title = Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome in the United States | journal = [[American Journal of Diseases of Children (1960)]] | volume = 130 | issue = 6 | pages = 599–607 | year = 1976 | month = June | pmid = 7134 | doi = | url =  }}</ref> Melish and Kawasaki had independently developed the same diagnostic criteria for the disorder, which are still used today to make the diagnosis of classic KD.

A question was raised whether the disease only started during the period between 1960 and 1970, but later a preserved heart of a 7 year old boy who died in 1870 was examined and showed three aneurysms of the [[coronary arteries]] with clots, as well as pathologic changes consistent with KD.<ref>Gee S J.
