'''Babesiosis''' is a [[malaria|malaria-like]] [[parasitic disease]] caused by infection with ''[[Babesia]]'', a [[genus]] of [[protozoa]]l [[piroplasmida|piroplasms]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Stephen A. |last1=Berger |first2=John S. |last2=Marr |title=Human Parasitic Diseases Sourcebook |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AB39e6KZ8MMC |year=2006 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning |isbn=978-0-7637-2962-2}}</ref> After [[Trypanosoma|trypanosome]]s, ''Babesia'' is thought to be the second most common blood [[parasite]]s of mammals, and they can have a major impact on health of domestic animals in areas without severe winters. Human babesiosis is uncommon, but reported cases have risen recently because of expanded medical awareness.<ref name="Hunfeld">{{cite journal |author=Hunfeld KP, Hildebrandt A, Gray JS |title=Babesiosis: Recent insights into an ancient disease |journal=Int J Parasitol |volume=38 |issue=11 |pages=1219–37 |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpara.2008.03.001 |pmid=18440005}}</ref>

== Symptoms and signs ==
Most cases of ''Babesia'' infection are asymptomatic, but can include mild fevers and diarrhea. The symptoms are often unnoticed or unexplained. In more severe cases, there are symptoms similar to [[malaria]], with fevers up to 40.5°C (105°F), shaking chills, and severe anemia (hemolytic anemia). Organ failure may follow, including adult respiratory distress syndrome. Severe cases occur mostly in people who have had [[splenectomy|their spleen removed surgically]]. Severe cases are also more likely to occur in the very young, very old, and persons with [[immunodeficiency]], such as [[HIV/AIDS]] patients.

A reported increase in babesiosis diagnoses in the 2000s is thought to be caused by more widespread testing and higher numbers of people with immunodeficiencies coming in contact with ticks, the disease vector.<ref name="Hunfeld"/> Little is known about the occurrence of ''Babesia'' species in malaria-[[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] areas, where ''Babesia'' can easily be misdiagnosed as ''[[Plasmodium]]''.

== Pathophysiology ==
[[Image:Babesia life cycle human en.svg|thumb|450px|''Babesia'' life cycle]]
''Babesia'' parasites reproduce in [[red blood cell]]s, where they can be seen as cross-shaped inclusions (four [[merozoite]]s asexually budding, but attached together forming a structure looking like a "[[Maltese cross]]")<ref name="Noskoviak2008">{{cite journal | author =Noskoviak K, Broome E | title = Images in clinical medicine. Babesiosis | journal = N Engl J Med. | volume = 358 | issue = 17 | pages = e19 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18434647 | doi =10.1056/NEJMicm070903 }}</ref> and cause [[hemolytic anemia]], quite similar to [[malaria]].

Unlike the ''[[Plasmodium]]'' parasites that cause malaria, ''Babesia'' species lack an exoerythrocytic phase, so the liver is usually not affected.

'''In animals''', ''[[Babesia canis]] rossi'', ''[[Babesia bigemina]]'', and ''[[Babesia bovis]]'' cause particularly severe forms of the disease, including a severe haemolytic anaemia, with positive erythrocyte-in-saline-agglutination test indicating an immune-mediated component to the haemolysis. Common sequelae include haemoglobinuria "red-water", disseminated intravascular coaguation and "cerebral babesiosis" caused by sludging of erythrocytes in cerebral capillaries.

In bovine species, the organism causes hemolytic anemia, so an infected animal will show pale mucous membranes initially. As the levels of billirubin (a byproduct of red blood cell lysis) continue to increase, the visible mucous membranes will become yellow in color (icterus) due to the failure of the liver to metabolise the excess bilirubin. Hemoglobinuria will be seen due to excretion of red-blood-cell lysis byproducts via the kidneys. Fever of 40.5°C (105°F) develops due to release of inflammatory byproducts.

== Diagnosis ==
Only specialized laboratories can adequately diagnose Babesia infection in humans, and as a result Babesia infections are considered highly under-reported. It develops in patients who live in or travel to an endemic area or receive a contaminated [[blood transfusion]] within the preceding 9 weeks, so this aspect of the medical history is vital.<ref name="idsa-guidelines"/> Babesiosis may be suspected when a person with such an exposure history develops persistent fevers and hemolytic anemia. The definitive diagnostic test is the identification of parasites on a [[Giemsa stain|Giemsa-stained]] [[blood film|thin blood smear]].<ref name="idsa-guidelines">{{cite journal |author=Wormser GP, Dattwyler RJ, Shapiro ED, ''et al.'' |title=The clinical assessment, treatment, and prevention of lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis: clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America |journal=Clin. Infect. Dis. |volume=43 |issue=9 |pages=1089–134 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17029130 |doi=10.1086/508667 |url=}}</ref> 

So-called "Maltese cross formations" on the blood film are essentially diagnostic of babesiosis, since they are not seen in malaria, the primary differential diagnosis.<ref name="Noskoviak2008"/> Careful examination of multiple [[smear test|smear]]s may be necessary, since ''Babesia'' may infect less than 1% of circulating red blood cells and thus be easily overlooked.<ref name="krause">{{cite journal |author=Krause PJ |title=Babesiosis diagnosis and treatment |journal=Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=45–51 |year=2003 |pmid=12804380 |doi=10.1089/153036603765627451 |url=}}</ref>

[[Serology|Serologic testing]] for [[antibody|antibodies]] against ''Babesia'' (both [[IgG]] and [[IgM]]) can detect low-level infection in cases with a high clinical suspicion, but negative blood film examinations. Serology is also useful for differentiating babesiosis from [[malaria]] in cases where people are at risk for both infections. Since detectable antibody responses require about a week after infection to develop, serologic testing may be falsely negative early in the disease course.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Krause PJ, Telford SR, Ryan R, ''et al.'' |title=Diagnosis of babesiosis: evaluation of a serologic test for the detection of ''Babesia microti'' antibody |journal=J. Infect. Dis. |volume=169 |issue=4 |pages=923–6 |year=1994 |month=April |pmid=8133112 |doi= 10.1093/infdis/169.4.923|url=}}</ref>

A [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) test has been developed for the detection of ''Babesia'' from the peripheral blood.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Persing DH, Mathiesen D, Marshall WF, ''et al.'' |title=Detection of Babesia microti by polymerase chain reaction |journal=J. Clin. Microbiol. |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=2097–103 |year=1992 |month=August |pmid=1500517 |pmc=265450 |doi= |url=http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1500517}}</ref> PCR may be at least as [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitive and specific]] as blood film examination in diagnosing babesiosis, though it is also significantly more expensive.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Krause PJ, Telford S, Spielman A, ''et al.'' |title=Comparison of PCR with blood smear and inoculation of small animals for diagnosis of ''Babesia microti'' parasitemia |journal=J. Clin. Microbiol. |volume=34 |issue=11 |pages=2791–4 |year=1996 |month=November |pmid=8897184 |pmc=229405 |doi= |url=http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/reprint/34/11/2791.pdf }}</ref> Most often, PCR testing is used in conjunction with blood film examination and possibly [[serology|serologic testing]].<ref name="idsa-guidelines"/>

Other laboratory findings include decreased numbers of [[red blood cells]] and [[platelets]] on [[complete blood count]].

In animals, babesiosis is suspected by observation of clinical signs (haemoglobinuria and anaemia) in animals in endemic areas. Diagnosis is confirmed by observation of merozoites on thin film blood smear examined at maximum magnification under oil using Romonovski stains (methylene blue and eosin). This is a routine part of the veterinary examination of dogs and ruminants in regions where babesiosis is endemic.

''Babesia canis'' and ''B. bigemina'' are "large babesias" that form paired merozoites in the erythrocytes, commonly described as resembling "two pears hanging together", rather than the "Maltese Cross" of the "small babesias". Their merozoites are approximately twice the size of small babesias.

Cerebral babesiosis is suspected ''in vivo'' when neurological signs (often severe) are seen in cattle that are positive for ''B. bovis'' on blood smear, but this has yet to be proven scientifically. Outspoken red discolouration of the grey matter ''post mortem'' further strengthens suspicion of cerebral babesiosis. Diagnosis is confirmed ''post mortem'' by observation of babesia-infected erythrocytes sludged in the cerebral cortical capillaries in a brain smear.

== Treatment ==

Most cases of babesiosis resolve without any specific treatment. For ill patients, treatment is usually a two-drug regimen, [[quinine]] and [[clindamycin]].<ref name="pmid14560566">{{cite journal |author=Setty S, Khalil Z, Schori P, Azar M, Ferrieri P |title=Babesiosis.

In this procedure, the infected red blood cells are removed and replaced with uninfected ones.

== Epidemiology ==
Babesiosis is a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector-borne]] illness usually transmitted by ''[[Ixodes scapularis]]'' [[tick]]s. ''Babesia microti'' uses the same tick vector as [[Lyme disease]] and [[ehrlichiosis]], and may occur in conjunction with these other diseases.<ref name="Hunfeld"/> The organism can also be transmitted by [[blood transfusion]].<ref>{{cite journal

==History==
The disease is named for the genus of the causative organism,<ref>[http://mw4.m-w.com/dictionary/babesia "babesia"] at [[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster]] online.</ref> which was named after the [[Romanian people|Romanian]] [[bacteriology|bacteriologist]] [[Victor Babeş]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|doctor|367|Victor Babeş}}</ref> [[Horse|Equine]] babesiosis is also known as piroplasmosis (from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''piro'', meaning [[pear]] + [[German language|German]] ''plasma'', a thing formed).<ref name=lexic>{{ cite web|url=http://www.lexic.us/definition-of/piroplasma |title=Definition of Piroplasma |publisher=lexic.us|accessdate=November 9, 2011}}</ref>

==In other animals==
Veterinary treatment of babesiosis does not normally use antibiotics. In animals, [[diminazen]] (Berenil), [[imidocarb]] or [[trypan blue]] would be the drugs of choice for treatment of ''B. canis rossi'' (dogs in Africa), ''B. bovis'', and ''B. bigemina'' (cattle in Southern Africa).

A vaccine is effective against ''B. canis canis'' (dogs in the Mediterranean region), but is ineffective against ''B. c. rossi''. ''[[Babesia imitans]]'' causes a mild form of the disease that frequently resolves without treatment (dogs in southeast Asia).
