'''Reactive hypoglycemia''', or '''postprandial hypoglycemia''', is a medical term describing recurrent episodes of symptomatic [[hypoglycemia]] occurring within 4 hours<ref name="NDIC">"Hypoglycemia." National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse, October 2008. http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/hypoglycemia/</ref> after a high [[carbohydrate]] meal (or oral glucose load) in people who do not have [[diabetes]]. It is thought to represent a consequence of excessive [[insulin]] release triggered by the carbohydrate meal but continuing past the [[digestion]] and disposal of the [[glucose]] derived from the meal.

The prevalence of this condition is difficult to ascertain because a number of stricter or looser definitions have been used. It is recommended that the term reactive hypoglycemia be reserved for the pattern of postprandial hypoglycemia which meets the [[Whipple criteria]] (symptoms correspond to measurably low glucose and are relieved by raising the glucose), and that the term [[idiopathic postprandial syndrome]] be used for similar patterns of symptoms where abnormally low glucose levels at the time of symptoms cannot be documented.

For diagnosis, a doctor can administer an Hb[[Glycated hemoglobin|A1c]] test to measure the blood sugar average over the past 2–3 months. Additionally, a 6-hour glucose tolerance test will chart blood sugar during the past six hours.

According to the U.S. National Institute of Health (NIH), a blood glucose level below 70&nbsp;mg/dL at the time of symptoms followed by relief after eating confirms a diagnosis for reactive hypoglycemia.<ref name="NDIC"/>

== Common symptoms ==
Symptoms vary according to individuals' hydration level and sensitivity to the rate and/or magnitude of decline of their blood glucose concentration. Some of the food-induced [[hypoglycemia]] symptoms include:
*Double vision or blurry vision
*Unclear thinking
*Sleeping Trouble
*[[heart]] [[palpitation]] or [[fibrillation]]
*[[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]
*dizziness
*light-headedness
*sweating
*headaches
*depression
*nervousness
*[[Myoclonus|muscle twitches]]
*irritability
*tremors
*[[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]]
*craving sweets
*increased appetite
*[[rhinitis]]
*nausea, vomiting
*[[panic attack]]
*numbness/coldness in the extremities
*confusion
*[[coma]] can be a result in severe untreated episodes

== Causes ==

The NIH states: "The causes of most cases of reactive hypoglycemia are still open to debate. Some researchers suggest that certain people may be more sensitive to the body’s normal release of the hormone epinephrine, which causes many of the symptoms of hypoglycemia. Others believe deficiencies in glucagon secretion might lead to reactive hypoglycemia.<ref name="NDIC"/>

Stomach surgery or [[hereditary fructose intolerance]] are both believed to be causes, albeit uncommon, of reactive hypoglycemia.<br/>
myo-inositol or D-chiro-inositol withdrawal can cause temporary reactive hypoglycemia.

==Types of reactive hypoglycemia==

There are different kinds of reactive hypoglycemia:<ref name="Brun"/>

# '''Alimentary Hypoglycemia''' (consequence of [[dumping syndrome]]; it occurs in about 15% of people who have had stomach surgery)
# '''Hormonal Hypoglycemia''' (e.g., [[hypothyroidism]])
# '''[[Helicobacter pylori]]-induced gastritis''' (some reports suggest this bacteria may contribute to the occurrence of reactive hypoglycemia)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Açbay O, Celik AF, Kadioğlu P, Göksel S, Gündoğdu S |title=Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis may contribute to occurrence of postprandial symptomatic hypoglycemia |journal=Dig.

# '''Late Hypoglycemia '''(Occult Diabetes; characterized by a delay in early insulin release from pancreatic [[β-cell]]s, resulting in initial exaggeration of hyperglycemia during a [[glucose tolerance test]])<ref name=health.am>{{cite web | title =Postprandial Hypoglycemia (Reactive Hypoglycemia) |

'''"Idiopathic Reactive Hypoglycemia"''' is a term no longer used because researchers now know the underlying causes of reactive hypoglycemia and have both the tools to perform the diagnosis
and the pathophysiological data explaining the mechanisms.<ref name="Brun"/>

To check if there is real hypoglycemia when symptoms occur, neither an [[glucose tolerance test|oral glucose tolerance test]] nor a breakfast test is effective; instead, a hyperglucidic breakfast test or ambulatory glucose testing is the current standard.<ref name="Brun">[http://www.alfediam.org/media/pdf/RevueBrunD&M5-2000.pdf J.F. Brun, C. Fedou, J. Mercier, "Postprandial Reactive Hypoglycemia," ''Diabetes & Metabolism'' (Paris) 2000, 26, 337-351]</ref><ref>[http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/79/5/1428 I Berlin, A Grimaldi, C Landault, F Cesselin and A J Puech, "Suspected postprandial hypoglycemia is associated with beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity and emotional distress," ''Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism'', November 1994]</ref>

== Treatment ==
To relieve reactive hypoglycemia, the NIH recommends taking the following steps <ref name="NDIC"/>

* Eating small meals and snacks about every 3 hours;
* Avoiding or limiting sugar intake;<ref>Kenrose, S. The Reactive Hypoglycemia Sourcebook, 2009. ISBN 978-0-557-07407-5"</ref>
* Exercising regularly; exercise increases sugar uptake which decrease excessive insulin release
* Eating a variety of foods, including meat, poultry, fish, or nonmeat sources of protein, foods such as whole-grains, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products;
* Choosing high-fiber foods.

[[Low-carbohydrate]] diet and/or frequent small split meals is the first treatment of this condition. The first important point is to add small meals at the middle of the morning and of the afternoon, when glycemia would start to decrease. If adequate composition of the meal is found, the fall in blood glucose is thus prevented. Patients should avoid rapidly absorbable sugars and thus avoid popular soft drinks rich in glucose or sucrose. They should also be cautious with drinks associating sugar and alcohol, mainly in the fasting state.<ref name="Brun"/>

==Postprandial syndrome and adrenergic postprandial syndrome==

If there is no hypoglycemia at the time of the symptoms, this condition is called "postprandial syndrome." It might be an "adrenergic postprandial syndrome" &mdash; blood glucose levels are normal, but the symptoms are caused through autonomic adrenergic counterregulation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Postprandial Hypoglycemia|url=http://www.insulinoma.net/english%20homepage/mainpage/subpage/Epostpran_hypo.htm#APS|accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref>  Often, this syndrome is associated with emotional distress and anxious behaviour of the patient.<ref name="Brun"/> Dietary recommendations for reactive hypoglycemia can help to relieve symptoms of postprandial syndrome.
