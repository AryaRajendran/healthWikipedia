'''Self-harm''' (SH) or '''deliberate self-harm''' (DSH) includes '''self-injury''' (SI) and '''self-poisoning''' and is defined as the intentional, direct injuring of body tissue most often done without [[suicide|suicidal]] intentions. These terms are used in the more recent literature in an attempt to reach a more neutral terminology. The older literature, especially that which predates the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR), almost exclusively refers to '''self-mutilation'''. The term is synonymous with "self-injury".<ref name=Gindhu05>{{citation |author=Laye-Gindhu, A. |title=Nonsuicidal Self-Harm Among Community Adolescents: Understanding the "Whats" and "Whys" of Self-Harm |journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence |volume=34 |year=2005 |pages=447–457 |doi=10.1007/s10964-005-7262-z |last2=Schonert-Reichl |first2=Kimberly A. |issue=5}}</ref><ref name="Klonsky07">{{citation |author=Klonsky, E.

Self-harm (SH), also referred to as ''self-injury'' (SI), ''self-inflicted violence'' (SIV), ''Non-Suicidal Self Injury'' (NSSI) or ''self-injurious behavior'' (SIB), refers to a spectrum of behaviors where demonstrable injury is self-inflicted.<ref name="firstsigns-book">{{citation |title=Self Injury Awareness Book |url=http://www.firstsigns.org.uk/publications |year=2007 |isbn=0-9555506-0-2 |accessdate=2008-05-26 |publisher=FirstSigns |location=S. l.}}</ref> The most common form of self-harm involves cutting of the skin using a sharp object, e. g. a knife or razor blade. The term ''self-mutilation'' is also sometimes used, although this phrase evokes connotations that some find worrisome, inaccurate, or offensive.<ref name="firstsigns-book"/> ''[[Self-inflicted wound]]s'' is a specific term associated with soldiers to describe non-lethal injuries inflicted in order to obtain early dismissal from combat.<ref>{{citation |author=Duffy, M. |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/siw.htm |title=Example of Self-inflicted wounds in World War I |accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{citation |author=Spartacus Educational |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWblighty.htm |title=Reasons for Self inflicted wounds |accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> This differs from the common definition of self-harm, as damage is inflicted for a specific secondary purpose. A broader definition of self-harm might also include those who inflict harm on their bodies by means of disordered eating.

A common belief regarding self-harm is that it is an [[attention-seeking]] behavior; however, in most cases, this is inaccurate. Many self-harmers are very self-conscious of their wounds and scars and feel guilty about their behavior leading them to go to great lengths to conceal their behavior from others.<ref name="MHF"/> They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or conceal their scars with clothing.<ref name="spandler">{{citation |year=1996 |title=Who's Hurting Who?

== Pathophysiology ==

[[File:Self-injury.svg|right|thumb|350px|A flow chart of two theories of self-harm.]]
Self-harm is not typically suicidal behaviour, although there is the possibility that a self-inflicted injury may result in life-threatening damage.<ref name="helpguide">{{citation |author=Cutter, D., Jaffe, J. and Segal, J. |year=2008 |url=http://www.helpguide.org/mental/self_injury.htm |title=Self-Injury: Types, Causes and Treatment |accessdate=2008-05-26 |publisher=HELPGUIDE.org}}</ref> Although the person may not recognise the connection, self-harm often becomes a response to profound and overwhelming emotional pain that cannot be resolved in a more functional way.<ref name="MHF"/>

The motivations for self-harm vary as it may be used to fulfill a number of different functions.<ref name="welcometrust"/> These functions include self-harm being used as a coping mechanism which provides temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness and a sense of failure or [[self-loathing]]. There is also a positive statistical correlation between self-harm and emotional abuse.<ref name="meltzer"/><ref name="rea"/> Self-harm may become a means of managing and controlling [[suffering|pain]], in contrast to the pain experienced earlier in the sufferers life of which they had no control over (e. g. through abuse).<ref name="helpguide"/>

Other motives for self-harm do not fit into medicalised models of behaviour and may seem incomprehensible to others, as demonstrated by this quotation:
"My motivations for self-harming were diverse, but included examining the interior of my arms for hydraulic lines. This may sound strange. "<ref name="pembroke"/>

Assessment of motives in a medical setting is usually based on precursors to the incident, circumstances and information from the patient.<ref name="fox_hawton"/> However, limited studies show that professional assessments tend to suggest more manipulative or punitive motives than personal assessments.<ref>{{citation |author=Hawton, K., Cole, D., O'Grady, J., Osborn, M. |year=1982 |title=Motivational Aspects of Deliberate Self Poisoning in Adolescents |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=141 |pages=286–291 |doi=10.1192/bjp.141.3.286 |pmid=7139213 |issue=3}}</ref>

The UK [[Office for National Statistics|ONS]] study reported only two motives: "to draw attention" and "because of anger".<ref name="meltzer"/> For some people harming themselves can be a means of drawing attention to the need for help and to ask for assistance in an indirect way. It may also be an attempt to affect others and to manipulate them in some way emotionally.<ref name="welcometrust"/><ref name="helpguide"/> However, those with chronic, repetitive self-harm often do not want attention and hide their scars carefully.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.enotalone.com/article/3002.html |title=LifeSIGNS: "Self Injury Facts", eNotAlone |accessdate=2008-01-13}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.harmless.org.uk/faq.php?%20cat_id=2 |title=Myths about self harm |publisher=Harmless |accessdate=2009-12-13}}</ref>

Many people who self-harm state that it allows them to "go away" or [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociate]], separating the mind from feelings that are causing anguish. This may be achieved by tricking the mind into believing that the present suffering being felt is caused by the self-harm instead of the issues they were facing previously: the [[pain|physical pain]] therefore acts as a distraction from the original emotional pain.<ref name="spandler"/> To complement this theory, one can consider the need to "stop" feeling emotional pain and mental agitation. "A person may be hyper-sensitive and overwhelmed; a great many thoughts may be revolving within their mind, and they may either become triggered or could make a decision to stop the overwhelming feelings. "<ref name="lifesigns-precursors">{{Citation |accessdate= 2012-10-05 |url=http://www.lifesigns.org.uk/what/precursors |title=Precursors to Self Injury |publisher=LifeSIGNS}}</ref> The sexual organs may be deliberately hurt as a way to deal with unwanted feelings of sexuality, or as a means of punishing sexual organs that may be perceived as having responded in contravention to the person's wellbeing (e. g., responses to childhood sexual abuse).<ref name="Suyemoto98"/>

Those who engage in self-harm face the contradictory reality of harming themselves while at the same time obtaining relief from this act. It may even be hard for some to actually initiate cutting, but they often do because they know the relief that will follow. For some self-harmers this relief is primarily psychological while for others this feeling of relief comes from the [[endorphin|beta endorphins]] released in the brain.<ref name="welcometrust">{{citation |author=Swales, M. |url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/en/pain/microsite/culture4.html|title=Pain and deliberate self-harm |publisher=The Welcome Trust |accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> Endorphins are endogenous opioids that are released in response to physical injury, act as natural painkillers, and induce pleasant feelings and would act to reduce tension and emotional distress.<ref name="Klonsky07">{{citation |author=Klonsky, D. |year=2007 |title=The functions of deliberate self-injury: A review of the evidence |journal=Clinical Psychological Review |volume=27 |pages=226–239 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2006.08.002 |pmid=17014942 |issue=2}}</ref> Many self-harmers report feeling very little to no pain while self-harming<ref name="strong"/> and, for some, deliberate self-harm may become a means of seeking pleasure.

Alternatively, self-harm may be a means of feeling ''something'', even if the sensation is unpleasant and painful. Those who self-harm sometimes describe feelings of [[emptiness]] or numbness ([[anhedonia]]), and physical pain may be a relief from these feelings. "A person may be detached from himself or herself, detached from life, numb and unfeeling. They may then recognise the need to function more, or have a desire to feel real again, and a decision is made to create sensation and 'wake up'.

As a coping mechanism, self-harm can become psychologically [[behavioural addiction|addictive]] because, to the self-harmer, it works; it enables him or her to deal with intense stress in the current moment. The patterns sometimes created by it, such as specific time intervals between acts of self-harm, can also create a behavioural pattern that can result in a wanting or craving to fulfill thoughts of self-harm.<ref name="Nixon02">{{citation |author=Nixon, M. K. et al. |title=Affect Regulation and Addictive Aspects of Repetitive Self-Injury in Hospitalized Adolescents |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Physchiatry |volume=41 |issue=11 |year=2002}}</ref>

===Autonomic nervous system ===
Everyone has a natural set point for their ability to experience stress. For some people, this is a very high threshold; whereas other people can become overwhelmed very quickly. Emotional pain activates the same regions of the brain as physical pain,<ref>{{citation |year=2011 |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. |volume=108 |issue=15 |pages=6270–6275 |title= Social rejection shares somatosensory representations with physical pain }}</ref> so this can be a significantly intolerable state for some people. Some of this is environmental and some of this is due to physiological differences in responding.<ref>{{citation |year=2001 |journal=International Journal of Psychophysiology |volume=42 |pages=123–146 |title= The polyvagal theory: Phylogenetic substrates of a social nervous system}}</ref> The [[autonomic nervous system]] is composed of two components: the [[sympathetic nervous system]] controls arousal and physical activation (i. e. the [[fight-or-flight response]]) and the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] controls physical processes that are automatic (e. g. saliva production). The sympathetic nervous system innervates (i. e. is physically connected to and regulates) many parts of the body involved in stress responses. Studies of adolescents have shown that adolescents who self-injure have greater physiological reactivity (i. e. skin conductance) to stress than adolescents who do not self-injure.<ref>{{citation |year=2005 |journal= Development and Psychopathology |volume=17 |pages=1105–1127 |title=Psychological, physiological, and serotonergic correlates of parasuicidal behavior among adolescent girls }}</ref><ref>{{citation |year=2008 |journal= Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=76 |issue=1 |pages=28–38 |title= Physiological arousal, distress tolerance, and social problem-solving deficits among adolescent self-injurers}}</ref> This stress response persists over time, staying constant or even increasing in self-injuring adolescents, but gradually decreases in adolescents who do not self-injure.

== Treatment ==

There is considerable uncertainty about which forms of [[psychosocial]] and physical treatments of patients who harm themselves are most effective and as such further clinical studies are required.<ref name="Hawton98">{{citation |author=Hawton, K. et al. |title=Deliberate self harm: systematic review of efficacy of psychosocial and pharmacological treatments in preventing repetition |journal=[[British Medical Journal]] |volume=317 |year=1998}}</ref> Psychiatric and [[personality disorder]]s are common in individuals who self-harm and as a result self-harm may be an indicator of depression and/or other psychological problems.<ref name="Haw01"/> Many people who self-harm suffer from moderate or severe clinical depression and therefore treatment with [[antidepressant]] drugs may often be effective in treating these patients.<ref name="Haw01"/> [[Cognitive therapy|Cognitive behavioural therapy]] may also be used (where the resources are available) to assist those with [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual#Multi-axial system|Axis I]] diagnoses, such as depression, [[schizophrenia]], and [[bipolar disorder]]. [[Dialectical behaviour therapy]] (DBT) can be very successful for those individuals exhibiting a personality disorder, and could potentially be used for those with other mental illnesses who exhibit self-harming behaviour. Diagnosis and treatment of the causes of self-harm is thought by many to be the best approach to treating self-harm.<ref name="Suyemoto98"/> But in some cases, particularly in clients with a personality disorder, this is not very effective, so more clinicians are starting to take a DBT approach in order to reduce the behaviour itself. People who rely on habitual self-harm are sometimes psychiatrically hospitalised, based on their stability, their ability and especially their willingness to get help.<ref>{{citation |author=American Self-Harm Information Clearinghouse |url=http://www.selfinjury.org/docs/selfhelp.html |title=Self-help – how do I stop right now? |accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref>

In individuals with developmental disabilities, occurrence of self-harm is often demonstrated to be related to its effects on the environment, such as obtaining attention or desired materials or escaping demands. As developmentally disabled individuals often have communication or social deficits, self-harm may be their way of obtaining these things which they are otherwise unable to obtain in a socially appropriate way (such as by asking). One approach for treating self-harm thus is to teach an alternative, appropriate response which obtains the same result as the self-harm.<ref name="bird">{{citation |author= Bird, F. et al. |year=1989 |title=Reducing severe aggressive and self-injurious behaviors with functional communication training |journal=American Journal on Mental Retardation |volume=94 |pages=37–48 |pmid= 2751890 |issue=1}}</ref><ref name="carr">{{citation |author=Carr, E.

=== Gender differences ===

In general, the latest aggregated research has found no difference in the prevalence of self-harm between men and women.<ref name=kerr2010/> This is in contrast to past research which indicated that up to four times as many females as males have direct experience of self-harm.<ref name="fox_hawton"/> However, caution is needed in seeing self-harm as a greater problem for females, since males may engage in different forms of self-harm (e. g. hitting themselves) which could be easier to hide or explained as the result of different circumstances.<ref name="MHF"/><ref name=kerr2010/> Hence, there remain widely opposing views as to whether the gender paradox is a real phenomenon, or merely the artifact of bias in data collection.<ref name="Bowen2001"/>

The [[WHO]]/EURO Multicentre Study of Suicide, established in 1989, demonstrated that, for each age group, the female rate of self-harm exceeded that of the males, with the highest rate among females in the 13–24 age group and the highest rate among males in the 12–34 age group. However, this discrepancy has been known to vary significantly depending upon population and methodological criteria, consistent with wide-ranging uncertainties in gathering and interpreting data regarding rates of self-harm in general.<ref>{{citation |author=O'Brien, A. |title=Women and Parasuicide: a Literature Review |accessdate=2008-05-26 |url=http://www.whc.ie/publications/reports_parasuicide.html |publisher=Women's Health Council}}{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> Such problems have sometimes been the focus of criticism in the context of broader psychosocial interpretation. For example, feminist author Barbara Brickman has speculated that reported gender differences in rates of self-harm are due to deliberate socially biased methodological and sampling errors, directly blaming medical discourse for pathologising the female.<ref>{{citation |author=Brickman, Barbara Jane |year=2004 |title='Delicate' Cutters: Gendered Self-mutilation and Attractive Flesh in Medical Discourse |journal=Body and Society |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=87–111 |doi=10.1177/1357034X04047857}}</ref>

This gender discrepancy is often distorted in specific populations where rates of self-harm are inordinately high, which may have implications on the significance and interpretation of psychosocial factors other than gender. A study in 2003 found an extremely high prevalence of self-harm among 428 homeless and runaway youth (age 16 to 19) with 72% of males and 66% of females reporting a past history of self-harm.<ref>{{citation |author=Tyler, Kimberly A., Les B. Whitbeck, Dan R. Hoyt, and Kurt D. Johnson |year=2003 |title=Self Mutilation and Homeless Youth: The Role of Family Abuse, Street Experiences, and Mental Disorders |journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=457–474 |doi=10.1046/j.1532-7795.2003.01304003.x}}</ref> However, in 2008, a study of young people and self-harm saw the gender gap close, with 32% of young females, and 22% of young males admitting to self-harm.<ref name=affinity08/> Studies also indicate that males who self-harm may also be at a greater risk of completing suicide.<ref name=Hawton_BMJ_03/>

There does not appear to be a difference in motivation for self-harm in adolescent males and females. For example, for both genders there is an incremental increase in deliberate self-harm associated with an increase in consumption of cigarettes, drugs and alcohol. Triggering factors such as low self-esteem and having friends and family members who self-harm are also common between both males and females.<ref name="Rodham05"/> One limited study found that, among those young individuals who do self-harm, both genders are just as equally likely to use the method of skin-cutting.<ref>{{citation |author=Marchetto, M. J. |title=Repetitive skin-cutting: Parental bonding, personality and gender |journal=Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice |volume=79 |issue=3 |date=September 2006 |pages=445–459(15) |doi= 10.1348/147608305X69795}}</ref> However, females who self-cut are more likely than males to explain their self-harm episode by saying that they had wanted to punish themselves. In New Zealand, more females are hospitalised for intentional self-harm than males. Females more commonly choose methods such as self-poisoning that generally are not fatal, but still serious enough to require hospitalisation.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.nzhis.govt.nz/moh.nsf/pagesns/323?Open |title=Hospitalisation for intentional self-harm |publisher=New Zealand Health Information Service |accessdate=2008-05-03}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

=== Elderly ===

In a study of a district general hospital in the UK, 5.4% of all the hospital's self-harm cases were aged over 65. The male to female ratio was 2:3 although the self-harm rates for males and females over 65 in the local population were identical. Over 90% had depressive conditions, and 63% had significant physical illness. Under 10% of the patients gave a history of earlier self-harm, while both the repetition and suicide rates were very low, which could be explained by the absence of factors known to be associated with repetition, such as personality disorder and alcohol abuse.<ref name=Pierce87/> However, NICE Guidance on Self-harm in the UK suggests that older people who self-harm are at a greater risk of completing suicide, with 1 in 5 older people who self-harm going on to end their life.<ref name=NICE04/> A study completed in Ireland showed that older Irish adults have high rates of deliberate self-harm, but comparatively low rates of suicide.<ref name="pmid20716390"/>

=== Developing world ===

Only recently have attempts to improve health in the developing world concentrated on not only physical illness but mental health also.<ref name="Eddleston98">{{citation |author=Eddleston, M. et al. |title= Deliberate self-harm in Sri Lanka: an overlooked tragedy in the developing world |journal=[[British Medical Journal]] |volume=317 |pages=133–135 |year=1998}}</ref> Deliberate self-harm is common in the developing world. Research into self-harm in the developing world is however still very limited although an important case study is that of Sri Lanka, which is a country exhibiting a high incidence of suicide<ref>Ministry of Health. Annual health bulletin, Sri Lanka, 1995. Colombo, Sri Lanka: Ministry of Health (1997)</ref> and self-poisoning with agricultural [[pesticide]]s or natural poisons.<ref name="Eddleston98"/> Many people admitted for deliberate self-poisoning during a study by Eddleston ''et al. ''<ref name="Eddleston98"/> were young and few expressed a desire to die, but death was relatively common in the young in these cases. The improvement of medical management of acute poisoning in the developing world is poor and improvements are required in order to reduce mortality.

Some of the causes of deliberate self-poisoning in Sri Lankan adolescents included [[bereavement]] and harsh discipline by parents. The coping mechanisms are being spread in local communities as people are surrounded by others who have previously deliberately harmed themselves or attempted suicide.<ref name="Eddleston98"/> One way of reducing self-harm would be to limit access to poisons;<ref name="Eddleston98"/> however many cases involve pesticides or yellow [[Nerium oleander|oleander]] seeds, and the reduction of access to these agents would be difficult. Great potential for the reduction of self-harm lies in education and prevention, but limited resources in the developing world make these methods challenging.

=== Prison inmates ===

Deliberate self-harm is especially prevalent in prison populations. A proposed explanation for this is that prisons are often violent places, and prisoners who wish to avoid physical confrontations may resort to self-harm as a ruse, either to convince other prisoners that they are dangerously insane and resilient to pain or to obtain protection from the prison authorities.<ref>Diego Gambetta.

The term reappeared in an article in 1935 and a book in 1938 when [[Karl Menninger]] refined his conceptual definitions of self-mutilation. His study on self-destructiveness differentiated between suicidal behaviours and self-mutilation. For Menninger, self-mutilation was a non-fatal expression of an attenuated death wish and thus coined the term ''partial suicide''. He began a classification system of six types:

# religious – self-flagellants and others.
# puberty rites – hymen removal, circumcision or clitoral alteration.

J. |year=1993 |title=Diagnostic issues in self-mutilation |journal=Hospital and Community Psychiatry |pages=134–140 |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |url=http://www.ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/44/2/134 |accessdate=2009-06-22 |pmid=8432496 |volume=44 |issue=2}}</ref> Favazza also created two subcategories of sanctioned self-mutilations; ''rituals'' and ''practices''. The ''rituals'' are mutilations repeated generationally and "reflect the traditions, symbolism, and beliefs of a society" (p.&nbsp;226). ''Practices'' are historically transient and cosmetic such as piercing of earlobes, nose, eyebrows as well as male circumcision (for non-Jews) while ''Deviant self-mutilation'' is equivalent to self-harm.<ref name="Roe-Sepowitz"/><ref name="Favazza (1996)">{{citation |author=Favazza, A.

== Society and culture ==
[[Image:Orange ribbon.svg|thumb|100px || The orange ribbon of self-harm awareness.]]

Self-harm is known to have been a regular [[ritual]] practice by cultures such as the ancient [[Maya civilization]], in which the [[Maya priesthood]] performed auto-[[sacrifice]] by cutting and piercing their bodies in order to draw blood.<ref>{{citation |author=Gualberto, A. |year=1991 |title=An Overview of the Maya World |pages=207–208 |publisher=Produccion Editorial Dante |isbn=968-7232-19-6}}</ref> A reference to the priests of [[Baal]] "cutting themselves with blades until blood flowed" can be found in the Hebrew Bible.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:28|HE}}</ref> However, in Judaism, such self-harm is forbidden under [[Mosaic law]].<ref>Maimonides, [[Mishneh Torah]], ''Hilchot Khovel u-Mazik'' ch. 5, etc. ''See also'' [[Damages (Jewish law)]].</ref>

Self-harm is also practised by the [[sadhu]] or Hindu [[ascetic]], in Catholic [[mortification of the flesh]], in ancient Canaanite mourning rituals as described in the [[Ras Shamra]] tablets and in the Shi'ite annual ritual of [[Flagellant|self-flagellation]], using chains and swords, that takes place during [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] where the Shi'ite sect mourne the martyrdom of Imam Hussein.<ref>{{Citation|publisher=Jafariya news|author= Zabeeh I|title=Ashura observed with blood streams to mark Karbala tragedy |url=http://www.jafariyanews.com/2k5_news/feb/20ashur.htm|accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref>

=== Awareness ===
There are many movements among the general self-harm community to make self-harm itself and treatment better known to mental health professionals, as well as the general public. For example, March 1 is designated as [[Self-injury Awareness Day]] (SIAD) around the world.<ref>{{citation|publisher=LifeSIGNS|url=http://www.lifesigns.org.uk/siad/|title=Self injury awareness day|accessdate=2012-05-10}}</ref> On this day, some people choose to be more open about their own self-harm, and awareness organisations make special efforts to raise awareness about self-harm. Some people wear an orange [[list of awareness ribbons|awareness ribbon]] or [[gel bracelet|wristband]] to encourage awareness of self-harm.<ref name="lifesigns">{{citation |publisher= LifeSIGNS |url=http://www.lifesigns.org.uk |title=LifeSIGNS web pages|accessdate=2012-05-10}}</ref>

Self-harm in non-human mammals is a well-established but not widely known phenomenon. Its study under zoo or laboratory conditions could lead to a better understanding of self-harm in human patients.<ref name=Jones07/> 

Zoo or laboratory rearing and isolation are important factors leading to increased susceptibility to self-harm in higher mammals, e.g. macaque monkeys.<ref name=Jones07/> Lower mammals are also known to mutilate themselves under laboratory conditions after administration of drugs.<ref name=Jones07/> For example [[pemoline]], [[clonidine]], [[amphetamine]], and very high (toxic) doses of [[caffeine]] or [[theophylline]] are known to precipitate self-harm in lab animals.<ref>{{citation |author=Mueller K. and Nyhan W. L. |title=Clonidine potentiates drug induced self-injurious behavior in rats |journal=Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behaviour |year=1983 |volume=18 |pages=891–894 |pmid=6684300 |doi=10.1016/S0091-3057(83)80011-2 |issue=6}}</ref><ref>{{citation |author=Kies S.

In dogs, canine obsessive-compulsive disorder can lead to self-inflicted injuries, for example canine [[lick granuloma]]. Captive birds are sometimes known to engage in [[feather-plucking]], causing damage to feathers that can range from feather shredding to the removal of most or all feathers within the bird's reach, or even the mutilation of skin or muscle tissue. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Breeders of show mice have noticed similar behaviors.
One known as "barbering" involves a mouse obsessively grooming the whiskers and facial fur off of themselves and cage-mates.
Other behaviors include itching ears so severely, that large sections are lost.{{cn|date=February 2013}}
