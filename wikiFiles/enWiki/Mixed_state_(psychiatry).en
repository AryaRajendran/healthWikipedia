In the context of [[mental disorder]], a '''mixed state''', also known as '''dysphoric mania''', '''agitated depression''', or a '''mixed episode''', is a condition during which symptoms of [[mania]] and [[clinical depression|depression]] occur simultaneously, such as [[psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[anxiety]], [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[impulsiveness]], [[irritability]], morbid or [[suicidal ideation]], [[panic attack|panic]], [[paranoia]], [[pressured speech]] and [[rage (emotion)|rage]]. Typical examples include [[tearfulness]] during a manic episode or [[racing thoughts]] during a depressive episode. One may also feel incredibly frustrated or be prone to fits of rage in this state, since one may feel like a failure and at the same time have a [[flight of ideas]]. Mixed states are often the most problematic period of [[mood disorder]]s, during which susceptibility to [[substance abuse]], [[panic disorder]], commission of [[violence]], [[suicide]] attempts, and other complications increase greatly.

== Diagnostic criteria ==
As affirmed by the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV), a mixed state must meet the criteria for a major depressive episode and a manic episode nearly every day for at least one week.<ref>American Psychiatric Association. ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders''. 4th ed. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Press, Inc., 1994.</ref> However, mixed episodes rarely conform to these qualifications; they may be described more practically as any combination of depressive and manic symptoms.<ref>Akiskal, H.S. Pinto, O. (1999). The evolving bipolar spectrum. Prototypes I, II, III, and IV. ''Psychiatr Clin North Am''. 22(3):517–34.</ref><ref>Goldman, E. (1999). Severe Anxiety, Agitation are Warning Signals of Suicide in Bipolar Patients. ''Clin Psychiatr News''. pg 25.</ref><ref name="Perugi">Perugi, G. Toni, C. Akiskal, H.S. (1999). Anxious-bipolar comorbidity. Diagnostic and treatment therefore challenges. ''Psychiatr Clin North Am''. 22(3):565–83.</ref> The [[Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy]] (MMDT) splits the DSM-IV diagnosis into dysphoric mania and an agitated depression state.

A dysphoric mania consists of a manic episode with depressive symptoms. Increased energy and some form of anger, from irritability to full blown rage, are the most common symptoms (MMDT). Symptoms may also include [[auditory hallucination]]s, confusion, [[insomnia]], [[persecutory delusion]]s, racing thoughts, [[psychomotor agitation|restlessness]], and suicidal ideation. Alcohol, drug abuse, and some [[antidepressant]] drugs may trigger dysphoric mania in susceptible individuals.

An agitated depression is a "major depressive [episode] with superimposed [[hypomanic]] symptoms".<ref>Benazzi, F. (2000).

''Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci''. 250(5):249–53.</ref> A study by Goodwin and Ghaemi (2003) reported manic symptoms in two-thirds of patients with agitated depression, which they suggest calling "mixed-state agitated depression".<ref name="pmid14638572">{{cite journal |author=Goodwin FK, Ghaemi SN |title=The course of bipolar disorder and the nature of agitated depression |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=12 |pages=2077–9 |year=2003 |month=December |pmid=14638572 |doi= |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14638572}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
Treatment of mixed states is typically based upon administration of [[mood stabilizer|mood stabilizing]] medication, which may include [[anticonvulsant]]s such as [[valproic acid]]; [[atypical antipsychotic]]s such as [[olanzapine]], [[aripiprazole]], and [[ziprasidone]]; or first-generation [[antipsychotics]] such as [[haloperidol]]. There is question of [[lithium pharmacology|lithium's]] efficacy for treatment of mixed states due to conflicting conclusions drawn from various trials and research.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16511729 Pharmacotherapy of manic-depressive mixed States]</ref><ref>Muzina, D. J. (2009), Pharmacologic treatment of rapid cycling and mixed states in bipolar disorder: an argument for the use of lithium.
