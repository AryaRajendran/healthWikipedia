A '''tension headache''' (renamed a '''tension-type headache''' by the [[International Headache Society]] in 1988) is the most common type of primary  [[headache]]. The [[pain]] can radiate from the lower back of the head, the neck, eyes, or other muscle groups in the body. Tension-type headaches account for nearly 90% of all headaches. Approximately 3% of the population has chronic tension-type headaches.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rasmussen BK, Jensen R, Schroll M, Olesen J |title=Epidemiology of headache in a general population—a prevalence study |journal=J Clin Epidemiol |volume=44 |issue=11 |pages=1147–57 |year=1991 |pmid=1941010 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0895-4356(91)90147-2}}</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==

Tension-type headache pain is often described as a constant pressure, as if the head were being squeezed in a [[vice (tool)|vice]]. The pain is frequently [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]] which means it is present on both sides of the head at once. Tension-type headache pain is typically mild to moderate, but may be severe.

=== Frequency and duration ===

Tension-type headaches can be [[wikt:episodic|episodic]] or [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The International Classification of Headache Disorders: 2nd edition |journal=Cephalalgia |volume=24 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=9–160 |year=2004 |pmid=14979299 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2982.2004.00653.x |author1= Headache Classification Subcommittee of the International Headache Society}} [http://www.i-h-s.org/upload/ct_clas/ihc_II_main_no_print.pdf as PDF]</ref> Episodic tension-type headaches are defined as tension-type headaches occurring fewer than 15 days a month, whereas chronic tension headaches occur 15 days or more a month for at least 6 months. Tension-type headaches can last from minutes to days, months or even years, though a typical tension headache lasts 4–6 hours.

== Cause ==

Various precipitating factors may cause tension-type headaches in susceptible individuals:<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1142908|Muscle Contraction Tension Headache}}</ref>

* Stress: usually occurs in the afternoon after long stressful work hours or after an exam
* [[Sleep deprivation]]
* Uncomfortable stressful position and/or bad posture
* Irregular meal time ([[hunger]])
* Eyestrain

One half of patients with tension-type headaches identify stress or hunger as a precipitating factor.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Tension-type headaches may be caused by [[muscle tension]] around the head and neck. One of the theories says that the main cause for tension-type headaches and [[migraine]] is teeth clenching which causes a chronic contraction of the [[temporalis muscle]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Another theory is that the pain may be caused by a malfunctioning pain filter which is located in the brain stem. The view is that the brain misinterprets information--for example from the temporal muscle or other muscles--and interprets this signal as pain. One of the main neurotransmitters that is probably involved is [[serotonin]]. Evidence for this theory comes from the fact that chronic tension-type headaches may be successfully treated with certain antidepressants such as [[amitriptyline]]. However, the analgesic effect of amitriptyline in chronic tension-type headache is not solely due to serotonin reuptake inhibition, and likely other mechanisms are involved. Recent studies of [[nitric oxide]] (NO) mechanisms suggest that NO may play a key role in the pathophysiology of CTTH.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ashina M, Lassen LH, Bendtsen L, Jensen R, Olesen J |title=Effect of inhibition of nitric oxide synthase on chronic tension-type headache: a randomised crossover trial |journal=Lancet |volume=353 |issue=9149 |pages=287–9 |year=1999 |month=January |pmid=9929022 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673698010794 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)01079-4}}</ref> The sensitization of pain pathways may be caused by or associated with activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and the generation of NO. Patients with chronic tension-type headache have increased muscle and skin pain sensitivity, demonstrated by low mechanical, thermal and electrical pain thresholds. Hyperexcitability of central [[nociception|nociceptive]] neurons (in [[trigeminal nucleus|trigeminal spinal nucleus]], [[thalamus]], and [[cerebral cortex]]) is believed to be involved in the pathophysiology of chronic tension-type headache.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ashina S, Bendtsen L, Ashina M |title=Pathophysiology of tension-type headache |journal=Curr Pain Headache Rep |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=415–22 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16282042 }}</ref> Recent evidence for generalized increased pain sensitivity or [[hyperalgesia]] in CTTH strongly suggests that pain processing in the central nervous system is abnormal in this primary headache disorder. Moreover, a dysfunction in pain inhibitory systems may also play a role in the pathophysiology of chronic tension-type headache.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pielsticker A, Haag G, Zaudig M, Lautenbacher S |title=Impairment of pain inhibition in chronic tension-type headache |journal=Pain |volume=118 |issue=1-2 |pages=215–23 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16202520 |doi=10.1016/j.pain.2005.08.019 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0304-3959(05)00418-5}}</ref>

==Prevention==
[[Tricyclics]] have been found to be more effective than [[SSRIs]] but have greater side effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jackson JL, Shimeall W, Sessums L, ''et al.'' |title=Tricyclic antidepressants and headaches: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=341 |issue= |pages=c5222 |year=2010 |pmid=20961988 |pmc=2958257 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c5222|url=}}</ref> Evidence is insufficient for the use of [[propranolol]] and [[muscle relaxants]] for prevention of tension headaches.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Verhagen AP, Damen L, Berger MY, Passchier J, Koes BW |title=Lack of benefit for prophylactic drugs of tension-type headache in adults: a systematic review |journal=Fam Pract |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=151–65 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20028727 |doi=10.1093/fampra/cmp089 |url=}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
Episodic tension-type headaches generally respond well to over-the-counter [[analgesic]]s such as ibuprofen, paracetamol/acetaminophen, and aspirin. Analgesic/sedative combinations are widely used (e.g., analgesic/antihistamine combinations like Syndol, Mersyndol and Percogesic, analgesic/barbiturate combinations such as Fiorinal). Frequent use of analgesics may, however, lead to [[medication overuse headache]]. The first-line treatment for chronic tension type headache is [[amitriptyline]], whereas [[mirtazapine]] and [[venlafaxine]] are second-line treatment options.<ref name="pmid21247362">{{cite journal |author=Bendtsen L, Jensen R |title=Treating tension-type headache — an expert opinion |journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=1099–109 |year=2011 |month=May |pmid=21247362 |doi=10.1517/14656566.2011.548806 }}</ref> Other medication options include [[topiramate]] and [[sodium valproate]] (as [[prophylaxis]]).<ref name="pmid18231713">{{cite journal |author=Yurekli VA, Akhan G, Kutluhan S, Uzar E, Koyuncuoglu HR, Gultekin F |title=The effect of sodium valproate on chronic daily headache and its subgroups |journal=J Headache Pain |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=37–41 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18231713 |doi=10.1007/s10194-008-0002-5 |url=}}</ref> [[Biofeedback]] techniques may also help.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nestoriuc Y, Rief W, Martin A |title=Meta-analysis of biofeedback for tension-type headache: efficacy, specificity, and treatment moderators |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=379–96 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18540732 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.76.3.379 }}</ref><ref name="pmid18471128">{{cite journal |author=Rains JC |title=Change mechanisms in EMG biofeedback training: cognitive changes underlying improvements in tension headache |journal=Headache |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=735–6; discussion 736–7 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18471128 |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2008.01119_1.x |url=}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==

Tension headaches affect about 1.4&nbsp;billion people (20.8% of the population) and are more common in women than men (23% to 18% respectively).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vos|first=T|title=Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.|journal=Lancet|date=2012 Dec 15|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2163–96|pmid=23245607}}</ref>
== Prognosis ==
Tension headaches that do not occur as a symptom of another condition may be painful, but are not harmful. It is usually possible to receive relief through treatment. Tension headaches that occur as a symptom of another condition are usually relieved when the underlying condition is treated. Frequent use of pain medications in patients with tension-type headache may lead to the development of medication overuse headache or [[rebound headache]].
