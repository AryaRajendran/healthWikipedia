'''Footspeed''', or '''sprint speed''', is the maximum [[speed]] at which a human can run. It is affected by many factors, varies greatly throughout the population, and is important in [[athletic]]s and many sports, such as [[association football]], [[rugby football|rugby]], and [[American football]].

==Factors in speed==

The key determinant of footspeed in [[Sprint (running)|sprinting]] is the predominance of one distinct type of [[muscle fibre]] over another, specifically the ratio of fast-twitch muscles to slow-twitch muscles in a sprinter's physical makeup.  Though fast-twitch muscles produce no more energy than slow-twitch muscles when they contract, they do so more rapidly through a process of [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] metabolism, though at the cost of inferior efficiency over longer periods of firing.<ref name = "fibers">Quinn, Elizabeth. [http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/anatomyandphysiology/a/MuscleFiberType.htm "Fast and Slow Twitch Muscle Fibers"], ''About.com'', retrieved November 26, 2007.</ref>  The average human has an almost-equal ratio of fast-twitch to slow-twitch fibers, but top sprinters may have as much as 80% fast-twitch fibers, while top [[long-distance track event|long-distance runners]] may have only 20%.<ref name = "fibers"/> This ratio is believed to have genetic origins, though some assert that it can be adjusted by muscle training.<ref name = "Zeigler">Zeigler, Mark. [http://www.usoc.org/11611_32384.htm "The NFL treats 40-yard dash times as sacred"], ''USOC.com'', April 20, 2005, retrieved November 25, 2007.</ref><sup>[''[[Wikipedia:Dead link|Dead link]]'']</sup>  "Speed camps" and "Speed Training Manuals", which purport to provide fractional increases in maximum footspeed, are popular among budding professional athletes, and some sources estimate that 17% to 19% of speed can be trained.<ref name = "Zeigler"/><sup>[''[[Wikipedia:Dead link|Dead link]]'']</sup>

Though good running form is useful in increasing speed, fast and slow runners have been shown to move their legs at nearly the same rate – it is the [[force]] exerted by the leg on the ground that separates fast sprinters from slow.<ref name = "Human speed">Herper, Matthew. [http://www.forbes.com/2004/05/14/cx_mh_0514running.html "What's The Human Speed Limit?"], ''Forbes.com'', May 14, 2004, retrieved November 26, 2007.</ref>  Top short-distance runners exert as much as four times their [[body weight]] in [[pressure]] on the running surface. For this reason, [[muscle mass]] in the [[human leg|legs]], relative to total body weight, is a key factor in maximizing footspeed.<ref name = "Human speed"/>

==Limits of speed==

The fastest human footspeed on record is 44.72&nbsp;km/h (27.79&nbsp;mph), seen during a [[100 metres]] sprint (average speed between the 60th and the 80th meter) by [[Usain Bolt]].<ref>[http://berlin.iaaf.org/mm/document/competitions/competition/05/30/83/20090817081546_httppostedfile_wch09_m100_final_13529.pdf IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations) Biomechanical Research Project: Berlin 2009.]</ref>
Maximum human sprint speed is strikingly slower than that of many animals. Compared to other land animals, humans are exceptionally capable of [[endurance]], but exceptionally incapable of great speed.<ref name="Humans and animals">[http://www.physorg.com/news95954919.html "Humans hot, sweaty, natural-born runners"], ''Physorg.com'', April 16, 2007, retrieved November 27, 2007.</ref>  For example, [[cheetah]]s can attain short bursts of speed well over 100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph),<ref>Kruszelnicki, Karl. [http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/moments/gmis9911.htm "Fake Flies and Cheating Cheetahs"], ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation'', 1999, retrieved November 27, 2007.</ref> the [[American quarter horse]] has topped 88&nbsp;km/h (55&nbsp;mph),<ref>Rinehart, Janet. [http://www.iqhra.com/], ''Iowa Quarter Horse Racing Association'', retrieved November 27, 2007.</ref> [[greyhound]]s can reach 70&nbsp;km/h (43&nbsp;mph), and the [[Mongolian Wild Ass]] has been measured at 64&nbsp;km/h (40&nbsp;mph).<ref name="Animal speeds">American Museum of Natural History. [http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0004737.html "Speed of Animals"], ''Infoplease.com'', retrieved November 27, 2007.</ref>  Even the [[domestic cat]] may reach 48&nbsp;km/h (30&nbsp;mph).<ref name="Animal speeds" /> Some people incorrectly believe that all these animals would lose in a long distance race with a human.{{verification needed|date=July 2010}}  An example would be the [[Man versus Horse Marathon]], where horses with saddle and rider have bested almost all runners often by more than 25%.<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_versus_Horse_Marathon#Winners_of_the_race</ref>  

The primary advantage humans have over most land animals is a superior method of cooling themselves.  Most land animals cool themselves by panting, while humans are able to shed heat via perspiration.  On a hot day, similar to the African climate where humans evolved, many land animals would overheat and fatigue much faster than humans.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/health/27well.html?_r=0]</ref>  In Wales, where the Man versus Horse Marathon is held, the highest average temperature for any month is only 22 °C (72 °F).<ref>[http://www.united-kingdom.climatemps.com/]</ref>  The lower temperature reduces the cooling advantage humans possess.  Indeed, in the years that humans have won the Man versus Horse Marathon, the weather was reported as hot.
