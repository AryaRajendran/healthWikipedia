'''Nicogel''' is a "tobacco gel", applied to skin as a substitute for cigarette use.  Nicogel is a tobacco product, and is not a [[smoking cessation]] product.

==Usage==
Nicogel claims to be a cigarette alternative and designed so tobacco users can continue using "tobacco" in a discreet form.<ref name="nbc">[http://www.nbc4.com/health/10753838/detail.html Gel Could Help Satisfy Nicotine Cravings.] However use of Nicogel does not provide the characteristics of traditional tobacco usage.  Accessed on April 20, 2007.</ref>  Nicogel is sold as 50ml dispensers (containing "50 cigarette-equivalents") and as boxes of individually wrapped, single-use packets (containing either 10 or 120 cigarette-equivalents).<ref name="gelusa">[http://www.nicogelusa.com/index.htm Nicogel ::: Smoking Satisfaction in a Hand Gel]</ref>  Nicogel is "a water soluble gel containing liquefied tobacco."[http://www.nicogeldirect.com]

Because many public places have placed bans on smoking, Nicogel touts itself as a more convenient tobacco product.[http://www.nicogeldirect.com]


==Health Effects==
Nicogel claims that the product has 1/10 the nicotine of a cigarette.However, independent testing shows much less than 100 mcg per 1 ml.<ref name="nbc"/> With so little Nicotine, whether the product actually works is unclear.  [[American Cancer Society|American Cancer Society's]] director, Thomas J. Glynn, [[Ph.D.]], warns that "no independent research has been conducted to validate whether it's effective and safe," and that there is "no indication of [the] toxicity or level of nicotine it delivers."<ref name="mptoday">[http://www.medpagetoday.com/Psychiatry/Addictions/tb/4847 Nicogel in the Hand a Surrogate for Tobacco in the Lungs.] ''MedPage Today.'' Accessed on May 5, 2007.</ref> 

Nicogel has not been proven to be dermatologically tested, so there is no public data on whether the product is safe for use on normal skin. Nicogel may irritate [[sensitive skin type|sensitive skin]] and cause rashes, allergies, or red and swollen skin.[http://www.nicogeldirect.com] The makers advise pregnant or breast-feeding women to avoid Nicogel,[http://www.nicogeldirect.com/index.php] and assert that drinking [[alcohol]] in moderation is safe while using Nicogel.[http://www.nicogeldirect.com/index.php]

Nicogel contains on average only .015&nbsp;mg to max. 0.03&nbsp;mg of nicotine per serving of approx. 1ml. According to the manufacturer, Nicogel does not contain (N)-Nitrosamines.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}.  However, that has not been substantiated and no documents are available.
