An '''electrical burn''' is a [[burn]] that results from [[electricity]] passing through the body causing rapid injury. Approximately 1,000 deaths per year due to electrical injures are reported in the United States, with a mortality rate of 3-5%.<ref name="WB9">“Electrical Injuries in Emergency Medicine.” Medscape Reference. n.p. n.d. Web. 29 September 2011. < http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/770179-overview>.</ref> Electrical burns differ from [[Burn|thermal]] or [[Chemical burn|chemical]] burns in that they cause much more [[subdermal]] damage.<ref name="WB7">“Electrocution Burns.” Burn Survivor Resource Center. n.p. n.d. Web. 29 September 2011. <http://www.burnsurvivor.com/injury_examples_electrocution.html>.</ref> They can exclusively cause surface damage, but more often tissues deeper underneath the skin have been severely damaged. As a result, electrical burns are difficult to accurately diagnose, and many people underestimate the severity of their burn. In extreme cases, electricity can cause [[Electric shock|shock]] to the brain, strain to the heart, and injury to other organs.<ref name="WB1">Health Care Advisor: Burn Treatment Self Help Guide. n.p. n.d..

==Pathophysiology==
Three electrical factors determine the severity of the damage caused by electrical burns: [[voltage]], [[Electrical current|current]], and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]]. The severity of the burn also depends on the pathway the [[Electric current|current]] takes through the body.<ref name="WB2">“Electrical Burns: Causes and Treatment.” Anapol Schwartz: Attorneys at Law. Anapol Schwartz Weiss Cohan Feldman & Smalley. n.d. Web. 29 September 2011. <http://www.anapolschwartz.com/practices/burn-injury/electrical-burns.asp>.</ref> Generally, the pathway of the current will follow the course the least resistant tissues: firstly blood vessels, nerves, and muscle, then skin, tendon, fat, and bone.<ref name="r1">Docking, P. “Electrical Burn Injuries.” [[Accident and emergency nursing]] 7.2 (1999): 70-76. Print.</ref> Most commonly, electric injuries primarily damage the outer limbs, but more critical portions of the body may be affected as well causing severe complications.<ref name="r5">Xu, X ; Zhu, W ; Wu, Y. “Experience of the treatment of severe electric burns on special parts of the body.” Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences Vol.888 (1999): 121-30. Print.</ref>

As the body comes into contact with an electrical source, it becomes part of the electrical current. As such the current has a point of entry and an exit at two different points on the body. The point of entry tends to be depressed and leathery whereas the exit wound is typically more extensive and explosive.<ref name="r1"/> It is hard to accurately diagnose an electrical burn because only the entry and exit wounds are visible and the internal damage is not.<ref name="WB4">“What is an Electrical Burn?” Electrical Safety. n.p. n.d. Web. 29 September 2011. <http://www.electricalsafety.org/what-is-an-electrical-burn/>.</ref>

==Causes and classification==
Electrical burns can be caused by a variety of ways such as touching or grasping electrically live objects, [[short-circuiting]], inserting fingers into electrical sockets, and falling into electrified water. [[Lightning strike]]s are also a cause of electrical burns, but this is a less common event.<ref name="WBebi">“Electrical Burn Injuries.” Department of Surgery, Government Medical College, Miraj and General Hospital, Sangli, Maharashtra, India. 17 August 2003. Web. 29 September 2011. <http://www.medbc.com/annals/review/vol_17/num_1/text/vol17n1p9.asp>.</ref>
With the advances in technology, electrical injuries are becoming more common and are the fourth leading cause of work-related traumatic death.<ref name="Wbei">“Etiology.” Medscape Reference. n.p. n.d. Web. 29 September 2011. <http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/433682-overview#a0102>.</ref> One third of all electrical traumas and most [[high-voltage]] injuries are job related, and more than 50% of these injures result from power line contact.<ref name="Wbei"/>

Electrical burns can be classified into six categories, and any combination of these categories may be present on an electrical burn victim:
*'''Low-voltage burn'''. A burn produced by contact with a power source of 500 volts or less is classified as a low-voltage burn. The current at this voltage is not enough to cause tissue damage along its path except at the contact site. This type of burn may be mild, superficial, or severe depending on the contact time.<ref name="WB3">“Electrical Burns.” Burnsurgery.org. n.p. n.d. Web. 29 September 2011. <http://www.burnsurgery.org/Modules/initial_mgmt/sec_7.htm>.</ref>
*'''High voltage burn'''. This burn is very severe as the victim makes direct contact with the high voltage supply and the damage runs its course throughout the body. Exterior injuries are misleading as most of the damage occurs underneath the skin. In this case, subdermal tissues are severely damaged.<ref name="r1"/>
*'''Arc burn'''. This type of burn occurs when electrical energy passes from a high-resistance area to a low-resistance area.<ref name="WB4"/> No contact is required with an [[Electric arc|arc]] burn as the electricity ionizes air particles to complete the circuit. The heat generated can be as high as 4,000 degrees Celsius - hot enough to vaporize metal and ignite a victim’s clothing. A form of explosion dissipates excess energy from the arc.<ref name="WB3"/>                                                    In addition, a high-amperage arc can produce a [[pressure wave]] blast in excess of 1000 pounds per square inch of pressure. This can throw the victim and cause severe injuries.<ref name="WBbif">“Burn Injury Facts: Arc Flash/ Blast.” Hazard Prevention. April 2006. 1-2. Print.</ref>
*'''Flash burn'''. Flash burns are caused by electrical arcs that pass over the skin. The intense heat and light of an arc flash can cause severe burns.  Although the burns on the skin are largely superficial and cover a large area, tissues beneath the skin are generally undamaged and unaffected.<ref name="WB4"/>
*'''Flame burn'''. Associated with flash and arc burns, flame burns are caused by contact to objects that were ignited by an electrical source.<ref name="WB4"/>
* '''Oral burns'''. This is caused by biting or sucking on electrical cords, and it most commonly happens to children.<ref name="r2">Toon, Michael H ; Maybauer, Dirk M ; Arceneaux, Lisa L ; Fraser, John F ; Meyer, Walter ; Runge, Antoinette ; Maybauer, Marc O. “Children with burn injuries--assessment of trauma, neglect, violence and abuse.” Journal of injury & violence research 3.2 (2011): 98-110. Print.</ref> Electrical current typically passes from one side of the child’s mouth to the other, possibly causing deformity.

==Treatment==

===First aid===
An electrically burned patient should not be touched or treated until the source of electricity has been removed.<ref name="WB2"/> Electrical injuries often extend beyond burns and include cardiac arrhythmia, such as ventricular fibrillation. First aid treatments include assessment of consciousness of the victim, evaluation of pulse and circulation, and treatment of burns. <ref name="WB5">“How to Treat and Electrical Burn.” Livestrong.com. Demand Media, Inc. n.d. Web. 29 September 2011. <http://www.livestrong.com/article/234861-how-to-treat-an-electrical-burn/>.</ref> 

===Hospitalization===
Typically, an electrical burn patient has a lower affected body surface area than other burn patients, yet complication risks are much higher due to internal injury.<ref name="r4">Tredget, E E ; Shankowsky, H A ; Tilley, W A. “Electrical injuries in Canadian burn care. Identification of unsolved problems.” Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences Vol. 888 (1999): 75-87. Print.</ref> Often, the damaged internal tissue demands hospitalization. If not treated, this damaged tissue can cause complications (such as gaseous [[gangrene]] from dead tissue or loss of blood flow to limbs) and the damaged body parts may need to be [[amputate]]d.<ref name="WB4"/> Burn treatment for severe wounds may require [[skin grafting]], [[debridement]], excision of dead tissue, and repair of damaged organs.<ref name="r3">Orgill, D P; Pribaz, J J. “Functional Reconstruction following Electrical Injury.” Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences Vol.888. (1999): 96-104. Print.</ref>

===Rehabilitation===
Electrical burning has an effect on most vital body functions and is accompanied by several other electrical related injuries:
*Damage to the veins and arteries which can cause [[ischaemic]] [[necrosis]].
*Involuntary contraction of muscles due to [[electrical interference]] which can cause bone fractures and dislocations.
*Interference with the electrical conductivity of organs such as the heart and nerves. This can lead to [[seizures]], lung injury due to severe central nervous system damage, and [[cardiac arrest]].
*Forceful propulsion of the body, producing such injuries as spinal and limb fractures.<ref name="r1"/>

These injuries must be treated in addition to the burns themselves.

==Prevention==
The following are some basic safety rules for preventing electric injury:
*Avoid using electrical equipment and appliances while showering or wet.
*Use child safety plugs in all outlets.
*Keep children away from electrical cords.
*Follow manufacturer safety instructions when using electrical appliances.
*Turn off circuit breakers before making repairs to wiring.
*Never touch electrical appliances while touching faucets or cold water pipes.<ref name="WBebp">“Electrical Burns Prevention.” ThirdAge.com. ThirdAge Media, LLC. n.d. Web. 29 September 2011. <http://www.thirdage.com/hc/c/electrical-burns-prevention>.</ref> 
In addition, electricians, power-line repair men, and other industry workers should always follow proper safety procedures.
