In the [[nervous system]], '''efferent nerves''', otherwise known as [[motoneuron|motor]] or effector [[neurons]], carry [[action potential|nerve impulses]] ''away'' from the [[central nervous system]] to effectors such as [[muscle]]s or [[gland]]s (and also the ciliated cells of the inner ear). The term can also be used to describe relative connections between nervous structures (for example, a neuron's efferent synapse provides input to another neuron, and not vice-versa). The opposite activity of direction or flow is '''[[afferent nerve|afferent]]'''.

The [[motor nerve]]s are efferent nerves involved in muscular control. The [[cell (biology)|cell]] [[soma (biology)|body]] of the efferent neuron is connected to a single, long [[axon]] and several shorter [[dendrite]]s projecting out of the cell body itself. This axon then forms a [[neuromuscular junction]] with the effectors. The cell body of the motor neuron is [[satellite]]-shaped. The motor neuron is present in the [[grey matter]] of the [[spinal cord]] and [[medulla oblongata]], and forms an electrochemical pathway to the [[wikt:effector|effector organ]] or muscle. Besides motor nerves, there are efferent sensory nerves that often serve to adjust the sensitivity of the signal relayed by the afferent sensory nerve.

==Etymology and mnemonics==
Both '''afferent''' and '''efferent''' come from [[French language|French]], evolved from [[Latin]] (the basis of many terms in medicine and biology) for the terms, respectively, ''ad ferens'' (Latin verb ''ferre'': carry), meaning ''carrying into'', and ''ex ferens'', meaning ''carrying away''. ''Ad'' and ''ex'' give an easy [[mnemonic device]] for remembering the relationship between ''afferent'' and ''efferent'': '''''a'''fferent connection '''a'''rrives'' and an '''''e'''fferent connection '''e'''xits''.<ref>{{MedicalMnemonics|3502|3463|367|115}}</ref>
