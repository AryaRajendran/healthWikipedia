==History==
Until the last decade{{When|date=May 2012}}, coagulase-negative staphylococci occurring in urine specimens were usually regarded as a contaminant. In the early 1970s, more than ten years after the original demonstration of ''Staphylococcus saprophyticus'' in urine specimens, this species became recognized as a frequent cause of urinary tract infections. The bacterium has a capacity for selective adherence to human urothelium. It causes direct [[hemagglutination]]. The [[adhesin]] for ''S. saprophyticus'' is a lactosamine structure. This staphylococcal species produces an extracellular enzyme complex that can inhibit growth of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

Strains of ''S. saprophyticus'' have been isolated from humans and animal [[gastrointestinal tract]]s, meat and cheese products, vegetables, and environmental sources.

==Pathogenicity==
''S. saprophyticus'' is implicated in 10-20% of [[urinary tract infection]]s (UTIs). In females between the ages of about 17-27 it is the second most common causative agent of acute UTIs, after ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. The bacteria may also reside in the urinary tract and bladder of sexually active females.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rupp|first=ME|coauthors=Soper, DE; Archer, GL|title=Colonization of the female genital tract with Staphylococcus saprophyticus.|journal=Journal of clinical microbiology|date=1992 Nov|volume=30|issue=11|pages=2975–9|pmid=1452668}}</ref> It is referred to as "honeymooner's" UTI due to its association with intercourse. 

''S. saprophyticus'' is [[phosphatase]]-negative, [[urease]]- and [[lipase]]-positive. Two subspecies for saprophyticus exist: ''S. saprophyticus'' subsp. ''bovis'' and ''S. saprophyticus'' subsp. ''saprophyticus'', the latter more commonly found in human UTIs. ''S. Saprophyticus'' subsp. ''saprophyticus'' is distinguished by its being nitrate reductase negative and pyrrolidonyl arylamidase negative while ''S. Saprophyticus'' subsp. ''bovis'' is nitrate reductase positive and pyrolidonyl arymamidase negative.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hájek|first=V|coauthors=Meugnier, H; Bes, M; Brun, Y; Fiedler, F; Chmela, Z; Lasne, Y; Fleurette, J; Freney, J|title=Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. bovis subsp. nov., isolated from bovine nostrils.|journal=International journal of systematic bacteriology|date=1996 Jul|volume=46|issue=3|pages=792–6|pmid=8782691}}</ref>

===Symptoms of infection===
Some of the symptoms of infection by these bacteria are burning sensation when passing urine, the urge to urinate more often than usual, a 'dripping effect' after urination, weak bladder, a bloated feeling with sharp razor pains in the lower abdomen around the bladder and ovary areas, and razor-like pains during sexual intercourse.

Patients with UTIs caused by ''S. saprophyticus'' usually present with symptomatic [[cystitis]]. Signs and symptoms of renal involvement are also often registered.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jordan|first=PA|coauthors=Iravani, A; Richard, GA; Baer, H|title=Urinary tract infection caused by Staphylococcus saprophyticus.|journal=The Journal of infectious diseases|date=1980 Oct|volume=142|issue=4|pages=510–5|pmid=7192302}}</ref> The urine sediment of a patient with UTI caused by ''S. saprophyticus'' has a characteristic appearance under the microscope. Chemical screening methods for bacteriuria do not always succeed in diagnosing UTI caused by ''S. saprophyticus''. Even when such an infection occurs above the neck of the bladder, low numbers of colony-forming units (less than 10(5) cfu/ml) of ''S. saprophyticus'' are comparatively often found in the bladder and voided urine.

==Antibiotic susceptibility==
''S. saprophyticus'' is resistant to the antibiotic [[novobiocin]], a characteristic that is used in laboratory identification to distinguish it from ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis|S. epidermidis]]'', which is also coagulase-negative but novobiocin-sensitive.''S. saprophyticus'' is usually susceptible to antibiotics commonly prescribed for patients with UTI, with the exception of [[nalidixic acid]]. [[Quinolones]] are commonly used in treatment of ''S. saprophyticus'' urinary tract infections.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
