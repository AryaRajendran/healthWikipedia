'''Alcohol detoxification''', or ''detox'', for individuals with [[alcohol dependence]], is the abrupt cessation of alcohol intake coupled with substitution of [[Cross-tolerance|cross-tolerant]] drugs that have effects similar to the effects of alcohol in order to prevent [[Alcoholism#Alcohol withdrawal|alcohol withdrawal]]. As such, the term "detoxification" is somewhat of a misnomer since the process does not in any way involve the removal of toxic substances from the body. Detoxification may or may not be necessary depending upon an individual's age, medical status, and history of alcohol intake. For example, a young man who binge drinks and seeks treatment one week after his last use of alcohol may not require detoxification before beginning treatment for alcoholism.  [[Benzodiazepines]] are the most common family of drugs used for this,<ref name="pmid9214531">{{cite journal |author=Mayo-Smith MF |title=Pharmacological management of alcohol withdrawal.

==Benzodiazepines==
''[[Benzodiazepines]]'' such as [[chlordiazepoxide]] (Librium), [[diazepam]] (Valium), [[lorazepam]] (Ativan) or [[oxazepam]] (Serax) are the most commonly used drugs used to reduce alcohol withdrawal symptoms.  There are several treatment patterns in which it is used.

# The first option takes into consideration the varying degrees of tolerance. In it, a standard dose of the benzodiazepine is given every half hour until light sedation is reached. Once a baseline dose is determined, the medication is tapered over the ensuing 3&ndash;10 days.
# Another option is to give a standard dose of benzodiazepine based on history and adjust based on withdrawal phenomenon.
# A third option is to defer treatment until symptoms occur. This method should not be used in patients with prior, alcohol-related seizures. This has been effective in [[randomized controlled trials]].<ref name="pmid8046805">{{cite journal |author=Saitz R, Mayo-Smith MF, Roberts MS, Redmond HA, Bernard DR, Calkins DR |title=Individualized treatment for alcohol withdrawal.

Dosing of the benzodiazepines can be guided by the [[CIWA]] scale.<ref name="pmid2597811">{{cite journal |author=Sullivan JT, Sykora K, Schneiderman J, Naranjo CA, Sellers EM |title=Assessment of alcohol withdrawal: the revised clinical institute withdrawal assessment for alcohol scale (CIWA-Ar) |journal=British Journal of Addiction |volume=84 |issue=11 |pages=1353&ndash;7 |year=1989 |pmid=2597811 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1989.tb00737.x}}</ref> The scale is available online.<ref name="pmid10102003">{{cite journal |author=Holbrook AM, Crowther R, Lotter A, Cheng C, King D |title=Diagnosis and management of acute alcohol withdrawal |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=160 |issue=5 |pages=675&ndash;80 |year=1999 |pmid=10102003 |doi= |pmc=1230114}} ([http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&artid=1230114 see appendix 2])</ref>

Regarding the choice of benzodiazepine:
* Chlordiazepoxide (Librium) is the benzodiazepine of choice in uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal due to its long half-life.<ref>{{cite web

* Lorazepam or diazepam is available as an injection for patients who cannot safely take medications by mouth.
* Lorazepam and oxazepam are indicated in patients with impaired liver function because they are metabolised outside of the liver.

==Nitrous oxide==
Nitrous oxide has been shown to be an effective and safe treatment for alcohol withdrawal.<ref>Gillman M.A, Lichtigfeld, F.J. Enlarged double-blind randomised trial of benzodiazepines against psychotropic analgesic nitrous oxide for alcohol withdrawal, Addictive Behaviors, Volume 29, Issue 6, August 2004, Pages 1183â€“1187</ref> Over 20,000 cases of the alcoholic withdrawal state have been successfully treated with psychotropic analgesic nitrous oxide (PAN) in South Africa and Finland. In 1992 it was officially approved for the treatment of addictive withdrawal states by the medical authorities in South Africa. Consequently, patients receiving it can claim a refund from their medical insurance. The gas therapy reduces the use of highly addictive sedative medications (like benzopdiazepines and barbiturates) by over 90%. The technique thus reduces the danger of secondary addiction to benzodiazepines, which can be a real problem amongst alcoholics who have been treated with these agents.<ref>[http://www.sabri.org.za/  South African Brain Research Institute]</ref>

==Other drugs==
[[File:Alcover 17,5 - Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid.JPG|thumb|GHB sold in Italy for therapeutic use.]]
Some hospitals administer alcohol to prevent alcohol withdrawal although there are potential problems with this practice.<ref name="pmid12578486">{{cite journal |author=Blondell RD, Dodds HN, Blondell MN, ''et al.'' |title=Ethanol in formularies of US teaching hospitals |journal=JAMA |volume=289 |issue=5 |pages=552 |year=2003 |pmid=12578486 |doi=10.1001/jama.289.5.552}}</ref>

Various vitamins, especially from the [[B vitamin|B]] group, are often used during alcohol withdrawal treatment.

[[Sodium oxybate]] is the sodium salt of [[gamma-hydroxybutyric acid]] (GHB).  It is used for both acute alcohol withdrawal and medium to long-term detoxification. This drug enhances GABA neurotransmission and reduces glutamate levels.  It is used in [[Italy]] in small amounts under the trade name [[Alcover]].

[[Baclofen]] has been shown in animal studies and in small human studies to enhance detoxification. This drug acts as a GABA B receptor agonist and this may be beneficial.
