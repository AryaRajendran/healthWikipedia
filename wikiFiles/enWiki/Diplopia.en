'''Diplopia''', commonly known as '''double vision''', is the simultaneous [[perception]] of two images of a single object that may be displaced horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (i.e. both vertically and horizontally) in relation to each other.{{ref|Cassin}} It is usually the result of impaired function of the [[extraocular muscles]] (EOMs), where both eyes are still functional but they cannot converge to target the desired object.<ref name=osullivan>O'Sullivan, S.B & Schmitz, T.J.

==Classification==
===Binocular===
Binocular diplopia is double vision arising as a result of [[strabismus]] (in layman's terms ''cross-eyed''), the misalignment of the two eyes relative to each other either [[esotropia]] (inward) or [[exotropia]] (outward). In such a case while the [[fovea]] of one eye is directed at the object of regard, the fovea of the other is directed elsewhere, and the image of the object of regard falls on an extra-foveal area of the [[retina]]. 

The brain calculates the 'visual direction' of an object based upon the position of its image relative to the fovea. Images falling on the fovea are seen as being directly ahead, while those falling on retina outside the fovea may be seen as above, below, right or left of straight ahead depending upon the area of retina stimulated. Thus, when the eyes are misaligned, the brain will perceive two images of one target object, as the target object simultaneously stimulates different, non-corresponding, retinal areas in either eye, thus producing double vision. 

This correlation of particular areas of the retina in one eye with the same areas in the other is known as [[retinal correspondence]]. This relationship also gives rise to an associated phenomenon of binocular diplopia, although one that is rarely noted by those experiencing diplopia: Because the fovea of one eye corresponds to the fovea of the other, images falling on the two foveas are 'projected' to the same point in space. Thus, when the eyes are misaligned, the brain will 'project' two different images in the same visual direction. This phenomenon is known as 'confusion'. 

The brain naturally guards against double vision. In an attempt to avoid double vision, the brain can sometimes ignore the image from one eye; a process known as [[Suppression (eye)|suppression]]. The ability to suppress is to be found particularly in childhood when the brain is still developing. Thus, those with childhood [[strabismus]] almost never complain of diplopia while adults who develop [[strabismus]] almost always do. While this ability to suppress might seem an entirely positive adaptation to [[strabismus]], in the developing child this can prevent the proper development of vision in the affected eye resulting in [[amblyopia]]. Some adults are also able to suppress their diplopia, but their suppression is rarely as deep or as effective and takes longer to establish, and thus they are not at risk of permanently compromising their vision. Hence, in some cases diplopia disappears without medical intervention, but in other cases the cause of the double vision may still be present.

===Monocular===
More rarely, diplopia can also occur when viewing with only one eye; this is called '''monocular diplopia''', or, where the patient perceives more than two images, '''monocular polyopia'''. In this case, the differential diagnosis of multiple image perception includes the consideration of such conditions as corneal surface [[keratoconus]], subluxation of the lens, a structural defect within the eye, a lesion in the anterior [[visual cortex]] (rarely cause diplopia, more commonly [[polyopia]] or [[palinopsia]]) or [[non-organic]] conditions.

===Temporary===
Temporary diplopia can be caused by [[alcohol intoxication]] or head injuries, such as [[concussion]]. If temporary double vision does not resolve quickly, one should see an [[ophthalmologist]] immediately. It can also be a side effect of the anti-epileptic drugs [[Phenytoin]] and [[Zonisamide]], and the anti-convulsant drug [[Lamotrigine]], as well as the hypnotic drug [[Zolpidem]] and the dissociative drugs [[Ketamine]] and [[Recreational use of dextromethorphan|Dextromethorphan]]. Temporary diplopia can also be caused by tired and/or strained eye muscles or voluntarily. If diplopia appears with other symptoms such as fatigue and acute or chronic pain, the patient should see an optometrist immediately.

===Voluntary===
Some people are able to consciously uncouple their eyes, either by over focusing closely (i.e. going cross eyed) or unfocusing.  Also, while looking at one object behind another object, the foremost object's image is doubled (for example, placing one's finger in between one's face while reading text on a computer monitor). In this sense double vision is neither dangerous nor harmful, and may even be enjoyable. It makes viewing [[stereogram]]s possible.<ref>http://www.focusillusion.com/Instructions/  Instructions on how to view stereograms such as [[magic eye]]</ref>

==Treatment==
The appropriate treatment for binocular diplopia will depend upon the cause of the condition producing the symptoms. Efforts must first be made to identify and treat the underlying cause of the problem. Treatment options include eye exercises,<ref name=osullivan/> wearing an eye patch on alternative eyes,<ref name=osullivan/> [[prism correction]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Phillips PH. |year=2007|title= Treatment of diplopia | journal= Semin Neurol.|volume= 27|issue=3|pages=288–98 | doi = 10.1055/s-2007-979680 | pmid = 17577869 }}</ref> and in more extreme situations, surgery<ref name=kernich/> or [[botulinum toxin]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Taub, M.B. |year=2008|title= Botulinum toxin represents a new approach to managing diplopia cases that do not resolve | journal = Journal of the American Optometric Association| volume = 79|issue=4|pages= 174–175 | doi = 10.1016/j.optm.2008.01.003 }}</ref>
