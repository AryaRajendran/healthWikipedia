'''Repetitive strain injuries''' (RSIs) are "injuries to the [[musculoskeletal]] and [[nervous system]]s that may be caused by repetitive tasks, forceful exertions, vibrations, mechanical compression, or sustained or awkward positions".<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/health/eoh/peoshweb/ctdib.pdf Public Employees Occupational Safety and Health Program of the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services]</ref>  RSI is also known as ''cumulative trauma disorders'', ''repetitive stress injuries'', ''repetitive motion injuries or disorders'', ''musculoskeletal disorders'', and ''occupational or sports overuse syndromes''.

==Definition==

Repetitive strain injury (RSI) is a syndrome incorporating several discrete conditions associated with activity-related arm pain such as [[edema]], [[tendinitis]], [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], [[cubital tunnel syndrome]], [[thoracic outlet syndrome]], [[stenosing tenosynovitis]], [[intersection syndrome]], golfer's elbow or [[medial epicondylitis]], tennis elbow or [[lateral epicondylitis]], [[radial tunnel syndrome]], and [[focal dystonia]].<ref>J. Barondes, chair, "Musculoskeletal Disorders and the Workplace: Low Back and Upper Extremity", National Research Concil, 2001 (National Academy Press, Washington D. C.).</ref>

RSI is also used as a generalized umbrella term for non-specific illnesses popularly referred to as [[Blackberry thumb]], [[iPod finger]],  [[gamer's thumb]], Rubik's wrist or "cuber's thumb",<ref> Douglas Waugh MD, Can Med Assoc Journ.,125:1023-1024, </ref>, [[Trigger finger]], [[Stylus Finger]]<ref>[[http://ctsplace.com/5-injuries-made-possible-by-modern-technology.php/]]</ref>, Raver's Wrist<ref><a href="http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Raver%e2%80%99s+Wrist">Raver’s Wrist</a></ref>, and others.

== History ==

Although seemingly a modern phenomenon, RSIs have long been documented in the medical literature.  In 1700, the Italian physician Bernardino Ramazzini first described RSI in more than 20 categories of industrial workers in Italy, including musicians and clerks.<ref>Ramazzini, ''De Morbis Artificum Diatriba'' (Diseases of Workers), Modena Italy,1700.</ref>  Carpal tunnel syndrome was first identified by the British surgeon James Paget in 1854.<ref>Pearce JM (April 2009). "James Paget's median nerve compression (Putnam's acroparaesthesia)". Pract Neurol 9 (2): 96–9.</ref>  The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[surgery|surgeon]] [[Fritz de Quervain]] first identified Dequervain’s tendinitis in Swiss factory workers in 1895.<ref> Ahuja NK, Chung KC, "Fritz de Quervain, MD (1868-1940): stenosing tendovaginitis at the radial styloid process", J Hand Surg., vol.29 #6 pp. 1164–70.</ref>  The French neurologist Jules Tinel (1879-1952) developed his percussion test for compression of the median nerve in 1900.<ref>  Tinel, J., “Nerve wounds” London: Baillère, Tindall and Cox, 1917</ref>, <ref>Tinel, J., ‘’Le signe du fourmillement dans les lésions des nerfs périphériques’’, “Presse médicale”, 47, 388-389,1915</ref>,<ref>Tinel, J. ‘’The "tingling sign" in peripheral nerve lesions’’ (Translated by EB Kaplan). In: M. Spinner M (Ed.), “Injuries to the Major Branches of Peripheral Nerves of the Forearm”, 2nd ed. pp 8-13, Philadelphia: WD Saunders Co, 1978.</ref>  George Phalen improved the understanding of the aetiology of carpal tunnel syndrome with his clinical experience of several hundred patients during the 1950s and 1960s.[5]

==Treatment==
RSIs are assessed using a number of objective clinical measures.  These include effort-based tests such as grip and pinch strength, diagnostic tests such as [[Finkelstein's test]] for Dequervain's tendinitis,  [[Phalen maneuver|Phalen's Contortion]], [[Tinel sign|Tinel's Percussion]] for carpal tunnel syndrome, and [[electrophysiological|nerve conduction velocity]] tests that show nerve compression in the wrist.  Various imaging techniques can also be used to show nerve compression such as [[radiological|x-ray]] for the wrist, and [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] for the thoracic outlet and cervico-brachial areas.

The most-often prescribed treatments for early-stage RSIs include drug therapies such as anti-inflammatory medications combined with passive forms of physical therapy such as rest, splinting, massage and the like. Low-grade RSIs can sometimes resolve themselves if treatments begin shortly after the onset of symptoms. However, some RSIs may require more aggressive intervention including surgery and can persist for years.

General exercise has been shown to decrease the risk of developing RSI.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Work-Related Repetitive Strain Injury and Leisure-Time Physical Activity|last=Ratzlaff|first=C. R.|coauthors=J. H. Gillies, M. W. Koehoorn|journal=Arthritis & Rheumatism (Arthritis Care & Research) |volume=57 |issue=3 |year=2007 |month=April |pages=495–500 |pmid=17394178|doi=10.1002/art.22610}}</ref>  Doctors sometimes recommend that RSI sufferers engage in specific strengthening exercises, for example to improve sitting posture, reduce excessive [[kyphosis]], and potentially [[thoracic outlet syndrome]].<ref>Carolyn Kisner & Lyn Allen Colby, Therapeutic Exercise: Foundations and Techniques, at 473 (5th Ed. 2007).</ref>

Since workstation design often contributes to RSIs, ergonomic adjustments of the workstations are often recommended.

==Adjunct Intervention==

===Ergonomics===
Modifications of posture and arm use ([[ergonomics]]) are often recommended.<ref>Berkeley Lab. [http://www.lbl.gov/ehs/pub811/hazards/ergonomics.html ''Integrated Safety Management: Ergonomics'']. Website. Retrieved 9 July 2008.</ref> Specially designed tools such as [[pliers]] are now widely available for production line workers to minimise the risks of repetitive strain injuries. The handles of such pliers are bent so that the workpiece is aligned with the arm, wrist and hand. The [[handles]] are also designed to maximise [[grip]] using both [[thermoplastics]] and [[rubber]].

===Adaptive software===
{{Main|List of repetitive strain injury software}}

There are several kinds of software designed to help in repetitive strain injury. Among them, there are [[speech recognition]] software, and break timers.
Break timers software reminds the user to pause frequently and perform exercises while working behind a computer.
There is also automated mouse-clicking software that has been developed, which can automate repetitive tasks in games and applications.

===Adaptive hardware===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2012}}
[[Adaptive technology]] ranging from special keyboards, mouse replacements to pen tablet interfaces might help improve comfort.

====Mouse====
Switching to a much more ergonomic mouse, such as a roller mouse, vertical mouse or joystick, or switching from using a mouse to a stylus pen with graphic tablet may provide relief, but in chronic RSI they may result only in moving the problem to another area. Using a graphic tablet for general pointing, clicking, and dragging (i.e. not drawing) may take some time to get used to as well. Switching to a [[Touchpad|trackpad]] or [[pointing stick]], which requires no gripping or tensing of the muscles in the arms may help as well. Inertial mice (which do not require a surface to operate) might offer an alternative where the user's arm is in a less stressful thumbs up position rather than rotated to thumb inward when holding a normal mouse. Also, since they do not need a surface to operate ("air mice" function by small, forceless, wrist rotations), the wrist and arm can be supported by the desktop. 

Ergonomic accessories for the mouse can also make a difference. An accessory developed recently includes finger pads to create a softer surface for clicking as well as for helping the joints bend more when clicking. Additionally the accessory developed by the gel pads on mouse manufacturer includes a palm pad on the mouse to help the hand achieve a more grasping position further increasing overall ergonomics.

====Keyboards and keyboard alternatives====
Keyboard layouts such as [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]] and [[Colemak]] are promoted as alternatives to mitigate some of the strain arising from the standard QWERTY keyboard layout. Exotic keyboards by manufacturers such as [[Datahand]], OrbiTouch, [[Maltron keyboard|Maltron]] and [[Kinesis (keyboard)|Kinesis]] are also available. One can even use [[digital pen]]s to avoid the strain coming from typing itself{{dubious|date=August 2012}}. Other solutions move the mode of input from one's hands entirely. These include the use of [[speech recognition|voice recognition]] software or [[:wikt:pedal|pedal]]s designed for ergonomics and gaming to supplant normal keyboard input.
