'''Muscle Energy Technique''' is a type of [[osteopathic manipulative treatment]] used in [[osteopathic medicine]], [[physical therapy]], massage therapists and [[occupational therapy]].<ref>[http://www.ptadvantage.com/muscle_energy_techniques/index.htm "Athletic Advantage Physical Therapy"], Accessed April 28, 2008.</ref>  It is a form of osteopathic manipulative diagnosis and treatment in which the patient's muscles are actively used on request, from a precisely controlled position, in a specific direction, and against a distinctly executed physician counterforce. It was first described in 1948 by Fred Mitchell, Sr, [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]]<ref name=OsteoGlossary>{{cite web|title=Glossary of Osteopathic Terminology|url=http://www.aacom.org/resources/bookstore/Documents/GOT2011ed.pdf|publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|page=28|date=April 2009|accessdate=25 August 2012}}</ref> Muscle energy techniques are used to treat [[somatic dysfunction]], especially decreased [[range of motion]], [[muscular hypertonicity]], and pain.

== Pathophysiology ==
'''Injury''' can occur as a result of trauma, accidents, overuse, strain/sprain, etc., not all of which should be treated with muscle energy.  These techniques are most appropriate for the following injury patterns:
* Decreased range of motion secondary to muscular spasticity, rigidity, hypertonicity or hypotonicity.  Hypertonicity often follows overuse and can result in altered joint position, increased irritability and decreased elasticity.  This injury pattern is often accompanied by a non-specific muscle ache in the area of injury.<ref name="autogenerated83">{{cite book |last= DiGiovanna|first= Eileen|coauthors= Stanley Schiowitz, Dennis J. Dowling|editor= |others= |title= An Osteopathic Approach to Diagnosis and Treatment|origyear= 1991|accessdate= |edition= Third|year= 2005|publisher= Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 83–85|chapter= Muscle Energy (Chapter 13)}}</ref>
* Interneuronal injury—when dysfunction occurs at one joint or segment, the related [[Agonist (muscle)|agonist muscles]] are also affected.  If uncorrected, the [[Antagonist (muscle)|antagonistic muscles]] eventually become involved as well, leading to dysfunction of both muscle groups.  This presents as decreased range of motion with pain and/or tenderness in the area.

== Mechanism of Action for Muscle Energy Techniques ==
Muscle energy is a '''direct''' and '''active''' technique; meaning it engages a restrictive barrier and requires the patient's participation for maximal effect.  As the patient performs an [[muscle contraction|isometric contraction]], the following physiologic changes occur: 
* [[Golgi tendon organ]] activation results in direct inhibition of agonist muscles
* A reflexive [[reciprocal inhibition]] occurs at the antagonistic muscles
* As the patient relaxes, agonist and antagonist muscles remain inhibited allowing the joint to be moved further into the restricted range of motion.

Studies have shown that muscle energy techniques may significantly decrease disability and improve functionality in patients with disorders such as low back pain.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=14524509 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14524509|year=2003 |last1=Wilson |first1=E |last2=Payton |first2=O |last3=Donegan-Shoaf |first3=L |last4=Dec |first4=K |title=Muscle energy technique in patients with acute low back pain: a pilot clinical trial |volume=33 |issue=9 |pages=502–512 |journal=The journal of orthopaedic and sports physical therapy}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid= |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1443846103800151|year=2003 |last1=Ballantyne |first1=F |last2=Fryer |first2=G |last3=McLaughlin |first3=P  |title=The effect of muscle energy technique on hamstring extensibility: the mechanism of altered flexibility  |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=59–63 |journal=Journal of Osteopathic Medicine}}</ref>

== Indications/Contraindications ==
Muscle energy techniques can be employed to reposition a dysfunctional joint and treat the affected musculature.  Indications include, but are not limited to: muscular shortening, [[low back pain]], pelvic imbalance, [[edema]], limited range of motion, somatic dysfunction, respiratory dysfunction, cervicogenic headaches, and many others.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

These techniques are inappropriate when a patient has injuries such as [[Bone fracture|fractures]], [[Avulsion injury|avulsion injuries]], severe [[osteoporosis]], open wounds, or has [[Metastasis|metastatic disease]]. Additionally, because these techniques require active patient participation, they are inappropriate for any patient that is unable to cooperate.

== Techniques ==

Muscle energy techniques can be applied to most areas of the body. Each technique requires 8 essential steps:<ref name="autogenerated83"/>
# Perform and obtain an accurate structural diagnosis.
# Engage the restrictive barrier in as many planes as possible.
# Physician and patient engage in an unyielding counterforce where the patient's force matches the physician's force.
# The patient's isometric contraction has the correct amount of force, the correct direction of effort (away from the restrictive barrier), and the correct duration (3–5 seconds).
# Complete relaxation occurs after the muscular effort.
# The patient is repositioned into the new restrictive barrier in as many planes as possible.
# Steps 3-6 are repeated approximately 3-5 times or until no further improvement in range of motion is observed.
# The structural diagnosis is repeated to evaluate if the dysfunction has resolved or improved.
