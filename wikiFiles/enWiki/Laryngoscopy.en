'''Laryngoscopy''' ([[larynx]] + [[scope|scopy]]) is a medical procedure that is used to obtain a view of the [[vocal folds]] and the [[glottis]]. Laryngoscopy may be performed to facilitate [[tracheal intubation]] during [[general anesthesia]] or [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] or for procedures on the [[larynx]] or other parts of the upper [[tracheobronchial tree]].

==Direct laryngoscopy==
Direct laryngoscopy is carried out (usually) with the [[patient]] lying on his or her back; the laryngoscope is inserted into the [[mouth]] on the right side and flipped to the left to trap and move the [[tongue]] out of the line of sight, and, depending on the type of blade used, inserted either anterior or posterior to the [[epiglottis]] and then lifted with an upwards and forward motion ("away from you and towards the roof "). This move makes a view of the [[glottis]] possible. There are at least ten different types of laryngoscope used for this procedure, each of which has a specialized use for the otolaryngologist and medical speechpathologist. This procedure is most often employed in direct diagnostic laryngoscopy with biopsy. It is extremely uncomfortable and is not typically performed on [[conscious]] [[patient]]s, or on patients with an intact [[gag reflex]].

==Indirect laryngoscopy==
Indirect laryngoscopy is performed whenever the provider visualizes the patient's vocal cords by a means other than obtaining a direct line of sight.  For the purpose of intubation, this is facilitated by fiberoptic bronchoscopes, video laryngoscopes, fiberoptic stylets and mirror or prism optically-enhanced laryngoscopes.

All previous observations of the glottis and larynx had been performed under indirect vision (using mirrors) until 23 April 1895, when [[Alfred Kirstein]] (1863–1922) of Germany first described direct visualization of the vocal cords. Kirstein performed the first direct laryngoscopy in Berlin, using an esophagoscope he had modified for this purpose; he called this device an ''autoscope''.<ref name=Hirsch1986>{{cite journal |author=Hirsch NP, Smith GB, Hirsch PO |title=Alfred Kirstein.

With this in mind, he developed a laryngoscope designed for the sole purpose of tracheal intubation. Similar to Jackson's device, Janeway's instrument incorporated a distal light source. Unique however was the inclusion of [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] within the handle, a central notch in the blade for maintaining the tracheal tube in the midline of the oropharynx during intubation, and a slight curve to the distal tip of the blade to help guide the tube through the glottis. The success of this design led to its subsequent use in other types of surgery. Janeway was thus instrumental in popularizing the widespread use of directand tracheal intubation in the practice of anesthesiology.<ref name=Burkle2004/>

==Applications==
*Helps in intubation during the administration of general anaesthesia or for mechanical ventilation.
*Detects causes of voice problems, such as breathing voice, hoarse voice, weak voice, or no voice.
*Detects causes of throat and ear pain.
*Evaluates difficulty in swallowing : a persistent sensation of lump in the throat, or mucous with blood.
*Detects strictures or injury to the throat, or obstructive masses in the airway.

==Conventional laryngoscope==
[[File:Laryngoscopes-Miller blades.JPG|thumb|Laryngoscope handles with an assortment of Miller blades (large adult, small adult, [[pediatrics|pediatric]], [[infant]], and [[neonate]])]]
[[File:Macintosh Blades.jpg|thumb|'''Laryngoscope''' handle with an assortment of [[Robert Reynolds Macintosh|Macintosh]] blades (large adult, small adult, [[pediatrics|pediatric]], [[infant]], and [[neonate]])]]

The vast majority of tracheal intubations involve the use of a [[viewing instrument]] of one type or another. Since its introduction by Kirstein in 1895,<ref name="Hirsch1986"/> the conventional laryngoscope has been the most popular device used for this purpose. Today, the conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries with a [[light source]], and a set of interchangeable [[blade]]s.

===Laryngoscope blades===
Early laryngoscopes used a straight [[Ivan Magill|"Magill Blade"]], and this design is still the standard pattern veterinary laryngoscopes are based upon; however the blade is difficult to control in adult humans and can cause pressure on the [[vagus nerve]], which can cause unexpected [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s to spontaneously occur in adults.

Two basic styles of laryngoscope blade are currently commercially available: the curved blade and the straight blade. The [[Robert Reynolds Macintosh|Macintosh]] blade is the most widely used of the curved laryngoscope blades,<ref name=Scott2009>{{cite journal|author=Scott J, Baker PA|title=How did the Macintosh laryngoscope become so popular?|journal=Paediatric Anaesthesia|volume=19 | issue= Suppl 1|pages=24–9|year=2009|pmid=19572841|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9592.2009.03026.x|accessdate=27 August 2010}}</ref> while the Miller blade<ref>{{cite journal|author=Robert A.

There are many other styles of curved and straight blades (e.g., Phillips, Robertshaw, Sykes, Wisconsin, Wis-Hipple, etc.) with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging the field of view and even ports for the administration of [[oxygen]]. These specialty blades are primarily designed for use by [[Anesthesiologist|anesthetist]]s, most commonly in the [[Operating theater|operating room]].<ref name=Berry2007>{{cite book

The Macintosh blade is positioned in the [[vallecula]], anterior to the [[epiglottis]], lifting it out of the visual pathway, while the Miller blade is positioned posterior to the epiglottis, trapping it while exposing the glottis and vocal folds. Incorrect usage can cause [[dental trauma|trauma]] to the front [[incisor]]s; the correct technique is to displace the [[chin]] upwards and forward at the same time, not to use the blade as a lever with the teeth serving as the [[Fulcrum (mechanics)|fulcrum]].

The Miller, Wisconsin, Wis-Hipple, and Robertshaw blades are commonly used for infants. It is easier to visualize the glottis using these blades than the Macintosh blade in infants, due to the larger size of the epiglottis relative to that of the glottis.

==Fiberoptic laryngoscopes==
Besides the conventional laryngoscopes, many other devices have been developed as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. These include a number of indirect [[Optical fiber|fiberoptic]] viewing laryngoscopes such as the [[fiberscope|flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope]]. The flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope or [[rhinoscope]] can be used for office-based diagnostics or for tracheal intubation. The patient can remain conscious during the procedure, so that the [[vocal folds]] can be observed during [[phonation]]. [[Surgical instrument]]s passed through the scope can be used for performing procedures such as biopsies of suspicious masses. These instruments have become indispensable within the [[otolaryngology]], [[pulmonology]] and [[anesthesia]] communities.

Other available fiberoptic devices include the Bullard scope,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gorback MS |title=Management of the challenging airway with the Bullard laryngoscope |journal=Journal of Clinical Anesthesia |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=473–7 |year=1991 |pmid=1760171

|doi=10.1097/00000542-199410000-00044|accessdate=27 August 2010}}</ref> These devices are widely employed for tracheal intubation, especially in the setting of the difficult intubation (see below).

==Video laryngoscope==
[[File:Laryngoscope-Glidescope 02.JPG|thumb|Glidescope video laryngoscope, showing 60-degree angulated blade. The [[CMOS]] [[active pixel sensor]] (CMOS APS) [[video camera]] and [[Light#Light_sources|light source]] are located at the point of angulation of the blade. An [[Anaesthetic machine|anesthesia machine]] is visible on the [[Image resolution|high resolution]] [[TFT LCD|LCD monitor]].]]

The conventional direct laryngoscope uses a line of sight provided by a rigid [[viewing instrument]] with a light on the blade or intra-oral portion which requires a direct view of the target larynx; this view is clearly seen in 80-90% of attempts. The frequent failure of direct laryngoscopy to provide an adequate view for tracheal intubation led to the development of alternative devices such as the lighted stylet, and a number of indirect [[Optical fiber|fiberoptic]] viewing laryngoscopes, such as the [[fiberscope]], Bullard scope, Upsher scope, and the WuScope. Though these devices can be effective alternatives to direct laryngoscopy, they each have certain limitations, and none of them is effective under all circumstances. One important limitation commonly associated with these devices is fogging of the [[Lens (optics)|lens]].<ref>{{cite journal

|accessdate=16 July 2010}}</ref> In an attempt to address some of these limitations, Dr. Jon Berall, a [[New York City]] [[Internal medicine|internist]] and [[emergency medicine]] [[physician]], designed the camera screen straight video laryngoscope in 1998.

The [[Information Age|Digital Revolution]] has brought new technology to the practice of tracheal intubation. Several manufacturers have developed [[video laryngoscope]]s which employ [[Digital electronics|digital technology]] such as the [[CMOS]] [[active pixel sensor]] (CMOS APS) to generate a view of the glottis so that the trachea may be intubated. The [[Glidescope Video Laryngoscope|Glidescope]] video laryngoscope is one example of such a device. Other examples include the McGrath laryngoscope, Daiken Medical Coopdech C-scope vlp-100, the Storz C-Mac, Pentax AWS, and the Berci DCI laryngoscopes.

===Glidescope===
[[File:Glidescope 02.JPG|thumb|[[Anesthesiologist]] using Glidescope video laryngoscope to [[Tracheal intubation|intubate]] the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] of a [[Morbid#Morbidity|morbidly]] [[Obesity|obese]] patient with challenging [[airway]] [[Human anatomy|anatomy]]]]
In 2001, the Glidescope (designed by vascular and [[General surgery|general surgeon]] John Allen Pacey) became the first commercially available video laryngoscope. It incorporates a [[Image resolution|high resolution]] digital camera, connected by a video cable to a high resolution [[TFT LCD|LCD monitor]]. It can be used for tracheal intubation to provide controlled [[mechanical ventilation]], as well as for removal of foreign bodies from the airway. The Glidescope owes its superior results to a combination of five key factors:
#The steep 60-degree angulation of its blade improves the view of the glottis by reducing the requirement for anterior displacement of the tongue.
#The CMOS APS digital camera is located at the point of angulation of the blade (rather than at the tip). This placement allows the operator to more effectively view the field in front of the camera.
#The video camera is recessed for protection from blood and secretions which might otherwise obstruct the view.
#The video camera has a relatively wide viewing angle of 50 degrees.
#The heated lens innovation helps to prevent fogging of the lens, which might otherwise obscure the view.

Tracheal intubation with the GlideScope can be facilitated by the use of the Verathon Stylet, a rigid stylet that is curved to follow the 60° angulation of the blade.<ref name=Agro2003/> To achieve a 99% successful rate of intubation with the GlideScope requires the operator to acquire a new skill set with this stylet.

In a 2003 study, the authors noted that the GlideScope provided adequate vision of the glottis (Cormack and Lehane grade I-II) <ref>{{cite journal

Despite this significant limitation, the average time to intubate the trachea with the GlideScope was only 38 seconds.<ref name=Agro2003/> In 2005, the first major clinical study comparing the Glidescope to the conventional laryngoscope was published. In 133 patients in whom both Glidescope and conventional laryngoscopy were performed, excellent or good laryngeal exposure was obtained in 124/133 (93%) of Glidescope laryngoscopy patients, compared with only 98/133 (74%) of patients in whom conventional laryngoscopy was used.

The Verathon design team later produced the Ranger Video Laryngoscope for a [[United States Air Force]] requirement that is now rolling forward into [[Emergency medical services|EMS]] and military use. The Cobalt series of Glidescopes then introduced a single use variant that encompasses weights from 1000&nbsp;grams to morbid obesity and is successful in many airway syndromes as well. The Glidescope Ranger is a variant designed for use in pre-hospital airway management including air, land, and sea applications. This device weighs 1.5 pounds, and is waterproof as well as airworthy to 20,000 feet altitude. The Glidescope Cobalt is a variant that has a reusable video camera with light-emitting core which has a disposable or single use external shell for prevention of cross infection.

In August 2009, the team at Verathon collaborated with Professor John Sakles from the University of Arizona Emergency Department in achieving the world's first tracheal intubation conducted with the assistance of [[telemedicine]] technology. During this demonstration, Dr. Sakles and the University of Arizona Telemedicine service guided physicians in a [[rural]] [[hospital]] as they performed a tracheal intubation using the Glidescope.

===Other video laryngoscopes===
Several types of [[Laryngoscope#Video_laryngoscope|video laryngoscopes]] are also currently available, such as the Glidescope,<ref name=Agro2003/><ref name=Cooper2005/> McGrath laryngoscope,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shippey B, Ray D, McKeown D |title=Use of the McGrath videolaryngoscope in the management of difficult and failed tracheal intubation |journal=[[British Journal of Anaesthesia]] |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=116–9 |year=2008 |pmid=17959584

==Complications==
Cases of mild or severe injury caused by rough and inexperienced use of laryngoscopes have been reported. These include minor damage to the soft tissues within the throat which causes a sore throat after the operation to major injuries to the larynx and pharynx causing permanent scarring, ulceration and abscesses if left untreated.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}.  Additionally, there is a risk of causing tooth damage.
