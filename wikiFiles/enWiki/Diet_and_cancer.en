== Flavonoids ==

Flavonoids (specifically flavonoids such as the catechins) are "the most common group of [[polyphenolic]] compounds in the human diet and are found ubiquitously in plants."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Jeremy P.E|title=Flavonoids: modulators of brain function?|journal=British Journal of Nutrition|year=2008|month=May|volume=99|issue=E-S1|pages=ES60-ES77|doi=10.1017/S0007114508965776|pmid=18503736|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=1884724|accessdate=Nov. 25 2012}}</ref>  The widespread distribution of flavonoids, their variety and their relatively low [[toxicity]] compared to other active [[phytochemical|phytocompounds]] (for instance [[alkaloids]]) mean that many animals, including [[humans]], ingest significant quantities in their diet. Foods such as green and black tea, chocolate, wine, and grapes provide the most the significant source of flavonoids in the human diet.<ref name="Abdulla 2008 45–51">{{cite journal|last=Abdulla|first=Mohamed|coauthors=Per Gruber|title=Role of diet modification in cancer prevention|journal=BioFactors|date=16|year=2008|month=December|volume=12|issue=1-4|pages=45–51|doi=10.1002/biof.5520120108|pmid=11216504|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/biof.5520120108/abstract|accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref>

Recently, flavonoids (specifically catechins) have emerged as potential anticancer agents. Although much of the research is still in a preliminary stage, it is clear that flavonoids might induce mechanisms that affect cancer cells and inhibit tumor invasion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Frei|first=Balz|title=Studies force new view on biology of flavonoids|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-03/osu-sfn030507.php|publisher=Oregon State University|accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref>
[[UCLA]] cancer researchers have proposed that smokers who ate foods containing certain flavonoids, such as the [[flavan-3-ols]] (catechins) found in strawberries and green and black teas, [[kaempferol]] from brussel sprouts and apples, and [[quercetin]] from beans, onions and apples, may have reduced risk of developing lung cancer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Irwin|title=Fruits, vegetables, teas may protect smokers from lung cancer|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/fruits-vegetables-and-teas-may-51210.aspx|publisher=UCLA Newsroom|accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref>

Other examples of  foods high in flavonoids are garlic, onions, shallots, and leeks, which also contain [[vitamin C]], [[selenium]], and [[sulfur]] compounds that together, increase the metabolic disposal of chemical [[carcinogens]], thus potentially lowering the risk of cells turning cancerous.<ref name="Abdulla 2008 45–51"/>

[[Methionine]] breakdown products are also recycled back into [[methionine]] by [[homocysteine]] remethylation and methylthioadenosine (MTA) conversion (see the figure on the right). Vitamins B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>, [[folic acid]] and [[choline]] are essential cofactors for these reactions. SAM is the substrate for [[methylation]] reactions catalyzed by DNA, RNA and protein [[methyltransferase]]s.

The products of these reactions are [[methylated]] [[DNA]], [[RNA]] or [[proteins]] and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAH has a negative feedback on its own production as an inhibitor of methyltransferase [[enzymes]].

==Arginine methyltransferase==
Protein [[arginine]] N-[[methyltransferase]]-4 (PRMT4) [[methylation]] of [[arginine]] residues within [[proteins]] plays a critical key role in [[transcriptional]] regulation (see the PRMT4 pathway on the left). PRMT4 binds to the classes of [[transcriptional]] activators known as p160 and CBP/p300.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Zika |first=E. |first2=L |last3=Vandel |first3=L |last4=Ting |first4=JP |title=Interplay among coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1, CBP, and CIITA in IFN-gamma-inducible MHC-II gene expression |journal=[[Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] |year=2005 |volume=102 |issue=45 |pmid=16254053 |pmc=1283426 |pages=16321–16326 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0505045102 |display-authors=2 |last2=Fauquier }}</ref> The modiﬁed forms of these [[proteins]] are involved in stimulation of [[gene expression]] via steroid [[hormone receptor]]s. Signiﬁcantly, PRMT4 methylates core [[histone]]s H3 and H4, which are also targets of the [[histone]] acetylase activity of CBP/p300 coactivators. PRMT4 recruitment [[chromatin]] by binding to coactivators increases [[histone]] [[methylation]] and enhances the accessibility of [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] regions for [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. [[Methylation]] of the [[transcriptional]] coactivator CBP by PRMT4 inhibits binding to CREB and thereby partitions the limited cellular pool of CBP for [[steroid hormone]] receptor interaction.
