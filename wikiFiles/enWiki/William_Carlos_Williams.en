'''William Carlos Williams''' (September 17, 1883 – March 4, 1963) was an American poet closely associated with [[Modernist poetry|modernism]] and [[imagism]]. He was also a pediatrician and [[general practitioner]] of medicine with a [[medical degree]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]]. Williams "worked harder at being a writer than he did at being a physician" but excelled at both.<ref>Colgan, Richard (2009) ''Advice to the Young Physician: On the Art of Medicine''. Springer Press. p120</ref>

==Life and career==
Williams was born in [[Rutherford, New Jersey]]. His grandmother, an Englishwoman deserted by her husband, had come to the United States with her son, remarried, and moved to Puerto Rico. Her son, Williams' father, married a Puerto Rican woman of [[Northern Basque Country|French Basque]] and [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jewish]] descent. He received his primary and secondary education in Rutherford until 1897, when he was sent for two years to a school near Geneva and to the [[Lycée Condorcet]] in Paris. He attended the [[Horace Mann School]] upon his return to New York City and after having passed a special examination, was admitted in 1902 to the [[Perelman School of Medicine|medical school of the University of Pennsylvania]], from which he graduated in 1906.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpaulbishop.com/GPB%20History/GPB%20Archive/Section%20-%205/W.C.%20Williams/w_c__williams.htm |title=William Carlos Williams |publisher=Gpaulbishop.com |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Heather|title=William Carlos Williams|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/node/4009|publisher=Penn Current|accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref> He published his first book, ''Poems'', in 1909.

Williams married Florence Herman (1891–1976) in 1912, after his first proposal to her older sister was refused.<ref>{{Cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mrs. William Carlos Williams. |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0615FE3D5B167493C2AB178ED85F428785F9 | work=The New York Times |date=1976-05-20 |accessdate=2008-04-20 }}</ref>  They moved into a house in Rutherford, New Jersey, which was their home for many years. Shortly afterward, his second book of poems, ''The Tempers'', was published by a London press through the help of his friend [[Ezra Pound]], whom he met while studying at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

Although his primary occupation was as a family doctor, Williams had a successful literary career as a poet. In addition to poetry (his main literary focus), he occasionally wrote short stories, plays, novels, essays, and translations. He practiced medicine by day and wrote at night. Early in his career, he briefly became involved in the [[Imagist]] movement through his friendships with Ezra Pound and [[H.D.]] (also known as Hilda Doolittle, another well-known poet whom he befriended while attending the University of Pennsylvania), but soon he began to develop opinions that differed from those of his poet/friends.

In 1915 Williams also began to associate with a group of New York artists and writers known as "The Others."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=7349 |title=Poetry Archive bio on Williams |publisher=Poetryarchive.org |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref> Founded by the poet [[Alfred Kreymborg]] and the artist [[Man Ray]], this group included [[Walter Conrad Arensberg]], [[Wallace Stevens]], [[Mina Loy]], [[Marianne Moore]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]].

In 1920, Williams was sharply criticized by many of his peers (like H.D., Pound, and Wallace Stevens) when he published one of his most experimental books, ''Kora in Hell: Improvisations''. Pound called the work "incoherent" and H.D. thought the book was "flippant."<ref>{{cite web|last=Burt |first=Stephen |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-carlos-williams |title=Poetry Foundation bio on Williams |publisher=Poetryfoundation.org |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref> The dada artist and poet [[Baroness Elsa|Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]] critiqued Williams's sexual and artistic politics in her experimental prose poem review entitled "Thee I call 'Hamlet of Wedding Ring'", published in ''[[The Little Review]]'' in March 1921.<ref>Gammel, Irene. ''Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada, and Everyday Modernity.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002, 272.</ref>

A few years later, Williams published one of his seminal books of poetry, ''Spring and All'', which contained classic Williams poems like "By the road to the contagious hospital," "The Red Wheelbarrow," and "To Elsie." However, in 1922, the year before Williams published ''Spring and All'', [[T.S. Eliot]] published ''[[The Waste Land]]'' which became a literary sensation and overshadowed Williams' very different brand of poetic Modernism. In his ''Autobiography'', Williams would later write, "I felt at once that [''The Waste Land''] had set me back twenty years and I'm sure it did. Critically, Eliot returned us to the classroom just at the moment when I felt we were on a point to escape to matters much closer to the essence of a new art form itself—rooted in the locality which should give it fruit." And although he respected the work of Eliot, Williams became openly critical of Eliot's highly intellectual style with its frequent use of foreign languages and allusions to classical and European literature.<ref>Williams, William Carlos.

In his modernist epic collage of place, ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' (published between 1946 and 1958), an account of the history, people, and essence of Paterson, New Jersey, he tried to write his own Modernist epic poem, focusing on "the local" on a wider scale than he had previously attempted. He also examined the role of the poet in American society and famously summarized his poetic method in the phrase "No ideas but in things" (found in his poem "A Sort of a Song" and repeated again and again in [[Paterson (poem)|''Paterson'']]).

In his later years, Williams took on the role of elder statesman and mentored and influenced younger poets. He had an especially significant influence on many of the American literary movements of the 1950s, including the [[Beat movement]], the [[San Francisco Renaissance]], the [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain school]], and the [[New York School]].<ref>X. J. Kennedy & Dana Gioai, ''An Introduction to Poetry'', New York: Addison Wesley Longman Inc, 1998. ISBN 0-321-01556-8</ref>

One of Williams's most dynamic relationships as a mentor was with fellow New Jerseyite [[Allen Ginsberg]]. Williams included several of Ginsberg's letters in ''Paterson'', stating that one of them helped inspire the fifth section of that work.  Williams also wrote the introduction to Ginsberg's important first book, ''[[Howl and Other Poems]]'' in 1956.

After Williams suffered a heart attack in 1948, his health began to decline, and after 1949 a series of strokes followed. Williams died on March 4, 1963 at the age of seventy-nine at his home in Rutherford.<ref>{{Cite news|first= Phil|last= Casey|title=Poet Williams Dies of Stroke.

==Poetry==
The poet and critic [[Randall Jarrell]] said of his poetry, "William Carlos Williams is as magically observant and mimetic as a good novelist. He reproduces the details of what he sees with surprising freshness, clarity, and economy; and he sees just as extraordinarily, sometimes, the forms of this earth, the spirit moving behind the letters. His quick transparent lines have the nervous  and contracted strength, move as jerkily and intently as a bird."<ref>Jarrell, Randall. "Fifty Years of American Poetry." ''No Other Book: Selected Essays''. New York: HarperCollins, 1999.</ref> [[R. P. Blackmur]] said of Williams poetry "the Imagism of 1912 , self-transcended."<ref>Pratt, William. ''The Imagist Poem, Modern Poetry in Miniature'' (Story Line Press, 1963, expanded 2001). ISBN 1-58654-009-2</ref>

Williams' major collections are ''[[Spring and All]]'' (1923), ''[[The Desert Music and Other Poems]]'' (1954), ''[[Pictures from Brueghel and Other Poems]]'' (1962), and ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' (1963, repr. 1992). His most anthologized poem is "[[The Red Wheelbarrow]]", an example of the [[imagism|Imagist]] movement's style and principles (see also "[[This Is Just To Say]]"). However, Williams, like his peer and friend Ezra Pound, had already rejected the Imagist movement by the time this poem was published as part of ''Spring and All'' in 1923.

Williams is strongly associated with the American [[Modernist]] movement in literature and saw his poetic project as a distinctly American one; he sought to renew language through the fresh, raw idiom that grew out of America's cultural and social heterogeneity, at the same time freeing it from what he saw as the worn-out language of British and European culture. In 1920, this project took shape in ''Contact'', a periodical launched by Williams and fellow writer [[Robert McAlmon]]: "The two editors sought American cultural renewal in the local condition in clear opposition to the internationalists—Pound, ''The Little Review'', and the Baroness."<ref>Gammel, Irene. ''Baroness Elsa'', 264-65.</ref> [[Yvor Winters]], the poet/critic, judged that Williams' verse bears a certain resemblance to the best [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] poets of the 13th century.<ref>''Primitivism and Decadence: A Study of American Experimental Poetry''. New York: Arrow Editions, 1937.</ref>

Williams tried to invent an entirely fresh and uniquely American form of poetry whose subject matter centered on everyday circumstances of life and the lives of common people. He came up with the concept of the "variable foot" which Williams never clearly defined, although the concept vaguely referred to Williams' method of determining line breaks. Williams commented that the "variable foot" was a metrical device to resolve the conflict between form and freedom in verse.<ref>Interview with Stanley Koehler, ''Paris Review'', Vol. 6, 1962.</ref>

One of Williams' aims, in experimenting with his "variable foot", was to show the American (opposed to European) rhythm that he claimed was present in everyday American language. Stylistically, Williams also worked with variations on a line-break pattern that he labeled "[[triadic-line poetry]]" in which he broke a long line into three free-verse segments. A well-known example of the "triadic line [break]" can be found in Williams' love-poem "[[Asphodel, That Greeny Flower]]."<ref>''Encyclopedia of American Poetry: The Twentieth Century'', ISBN 978-1-57958-240-1</ref>

In a review of Herbert Leibowitz's biography of William Carlos Williams, ''"Something Urgent I Have to Say to You": The Life and Works of William Carlos Williams'', book critic Christopher Benfey wrote of Williams' poetry: "Early and late, Williams held the conviction that poetry was in his friend Kenneth Burke's phrase, 'equipment for living, a necessary guide amid the bewilderments of life.' The American ground was wild and new, a place where a blooming foreigner needed all the help he could get. Poems were as essential to a full life as physical health or the love of men and women."<ref>{{cite news | last = Benfey | first = Christopher | title = The Blooming Foreigner | url = http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/97770/william-carlos-williams-america-whitman | work = The New Republic | date = 2011-12-15 | accessdate=2011-12-07}}</ref> Williams expressed this viewpoint most famously in a line from his poem "Asphodel, That Greeny Flower" in which he wrote:
<poem>        It is difficult
to get the news from poems
         yet men die miserably every day
                     for lack
of what is found there.<ref>Williams, William Carlos. "Asphodel, That Greeny Flower." ''Collected Poems''. NY: New Directions, 1962.</ref>

==Legacy, awards and honors==

The U.S. [[National Book Award]] was reestablished in 1950 with awards by the book industry to authors of 1949 books in three categories. Williams won the first [[National Book Award for Poetry]], recognizing both the third volume of ''Paterson'' and ''Selected Poems''.<ref name=nba1950>
[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1950.html "National Book Awards – 1950"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-02-25.
<br/>With [[Neil Baldwin]] and [[Ross Gay]] essays from the Awards 50(?) and 60-year anniversary publications. Baldwin covers the award-sharing book: "The edition of the ''Selected Poems'' brought out in 1949 has of necessity over the past half-century been emended and expanded many times. ..."</ref>

In May 1963, he was posthumously awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for ''[[Pictures from Brueghel and Other Poems]]'' (1962) and the Gold Medal for Poetry of the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]]. The Poetry Society of America continues to honor William Carlos Williams by presenting an annual award in his name for the best book of poetry published by a small, non-profit or university press.

[[William Carlos Williams House|Williams' house]] in Rutherford is now on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. He was inducted into the [[New Jersey Hall of Fame]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Santi|first=Angela Delli|title=N.J. to Bon Jovi: You Give Us a Good Name|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-207_162-4769368.html|accessdate=2012-10-14|newspaper=CBS News|date=2010-06-01}}</ref>
