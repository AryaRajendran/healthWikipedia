[[File:Filariasis 01.png|thumb|right|300px|Life cycle of ''Wuchereria bancrofti'', a parasite that causes filariasis]]
'''Filariasis (philariasis)''' is a [[parasitic disease]] (usually an [[infection|infectious]] [[tropical disease]]) that is caused by thread-like [[nematode]]s (roundworms) belonging to the superfamily [[Filarioidea]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/lymphaticfilariasis/index.htm |title=Lymphatic Filariasis |accessdate=18 July 2010 |author=Center for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref> also known as "filariae".<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000040249|filariasis}}</ref> These are transmitted from host to host by blood-feeding [[arthropod]]s, mainly [[Black fly|black flies]] and [[mosquito]]es.

Eight known filarial nematodes use humans as their definitive hosts. These are divided into three groups according to the niche within the body they occupy: 
*Lymphatic filariasis is caused by the worms ''[[Wuchereria bancrofti]]'', ''[[Brugia malayi]]'', and ''[[Brugia timori]]''. These worms occupy the [[lymphatic system]], including the lymph nodes; in chronic cases, these worms lead to the disease [[elephantiasis]].
*Subcutaneous filariasis is caused by ''[[Loa loa]]'' (the eye worm), ''[[Mansonella streptocerca]]'', and ''[[Onchocerca volvulus]]''. These worms occupy the [[subcutaneous]] layer of the skin, in the fat layer. ''L. loa'' causes [[Loa loa filariasis|''Loa loa'' filariasis]], while ''O. volvulus'' causes [[onchocerciasis|river blindness]].
*Serous cavity filariasis is caused by the worms ''[[Mansonella perstans]]'' and ''[[Mansonella ozzardi]]'', which occupy the [[serous membrane|serous cavity]] of the [[abdomen]].

The adult worms, which usually stay in one tissue, release early [[larva]]l forms known as [[microfilaria]]e into the host's bloodstream. These circulating microfilariae can be taken up with a blood meal by the arthropod vector; in the vector, they develop into infective larvae that can be transmitted to a new host. 

Individuals infected by filarial worms may be described as either "microfilaraemic" or "amicrofilaraemic", depending on whether or not microfilariae can be found in their peripheral blood. Filariasis is diagnosed in microfilaraemic cases primarily through direct observation of microfilariae in the peripheral blood.  '''Occult filariasis''' is diagnosed in amicrofilaraemic cases based on clinical observations and, in some cases, by finding a circulating antigen in the blood.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most spectacular symptom of lymphatic filariasis is [[elephantiasis]]—edema with thickening of the skin and underlying tissues—which was the first disease discovered to be transmitted by mosquito bites.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://allcountries.org/health/lymphatic_filariasis.html |title=Lymphatic filariasis |work=Health Topics A to Z |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=2011-09-25}}</ref>  Elephantiasis results when the parasites lodge in the [[lymphatic system]].

Elephantiasis affects mainly the lower extremities, while the [[ear]]s, [[mucous membrane]]s, and [[amputation]] stumps are affected less frequently.  However, different species of filarial worms tend to affect different parts of the body: ''[[Wuchereria bancrofti]]'' can affect the legs, arms, vulva, breasts, and scrotum (causing hydrocele formation), while ''[[Brugia timori]]'' rarely affects the genitals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Interestingly, those who develop the chronic stages of elephantiasis are usually amicrofilaraemic, and often have adverse immunological reactions to the microfilariae, as well as the adult worms. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The subcutaneous worms present with skin rashes, urticarial [[papule]]s, and [[arthritis]], as well as hyper- and hypopigmentation [[macule]]s. ''Onchocerca volvulus'' manifests itself in the eyes, causing "river blindness" ([[onchocerciasis]]), one of the leading causes of blindness in the world.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Serous cavity filariasis presents with symptoms similar to subcutaneous filariasis, in addition to abdominal pain, because these worms are also deep-tissue dwellers.

==Diagnosis==
Filariasis is usually diagnosed by identifying microfilariae on [[Giemsa stain]]ed, thin and thick blood film smears, using the "gold standard" known as the finger prick test. The finger prick test draws blood from the capillaries of the finger tip; larger veins can be used for blood extraction, but strict windows of the time of day must be observed. Blood must be drawn at appropriate times, which reflect the feeding activities of the vector insects. Examples are ''W. bancrofti'', whose vector is a mosquito; night is the preferred time for blood collection. ''Loa loa's'' vector is the deer fly; daytime collection is preferred. This method of diagnosis is only relevant to microfilariae that use the blood as transport from the lungs to the skin. Some filarial worms, such as ''M. streptocerca'' and ''O. volvulus'', produce microfilarae that do not use the blood; they reside in the skin only. For these worms, diagnosis relies upon skin snips, and can be carried out at any time.

=== Concentration methods ===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
Various concentration methods are applied: membrane filter, Knott's concentration method, and sedimentation technique.

[[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) and antigenic assays, which detect circulating filarial antigens, are also available for making the diagnosis. The latter are particularly useful in amicrofilaraemic cases. Spot tests for antigen [http://www.jbtdrc.org/SEVA_FILA.pdf] are far more sensitive, and allow the test to be done any time, rather in the late hours.

Lymph node aspirate and chylus fluid may also yield microfilariae.  Medical imaging, such as CT or MRI, may reveal "filarial dance sign" in chylus fluid; X-ray tests can show calcified adult worms in lymphatics.
The DEC provocation test is performed to obtain satisfying numbers of parasites in daytime samples.  Xenodiagnosis is now obsolete, and eosinophilia is a nonspecific primary sign.

==Worm lifecycle==
Human filarial nematode worms have complicated lifecycles, which primarily consists of five stages. After the male and female worms mate, the female gives birth to live microfilariae by the thousands. The microfilariae are taken up by the [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] insect (intermediate host) during a blood meal. In the intermediate host, the microfilariae molt and develop into third-stage (infective) larvae. Upon taking another blood meal, the vector insect injects the infectious larvae into the dermis layer of the skin. After about one year, the larvae molt through two more stages, maturing into the adult worms.

Filariasis is considered endemic in 73 countries; 37 of these are in Africa. 

In the Americas, it is present in [[Brazil]], [[Costa Rica]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Guyana]], [[Haiti]], [[Suriname]], and [[Trinidad]] and [[Tobago]]. 

In the Middle East, it is present only in [[Yemen]]. 

In Asia, it is present in [[Bangladesh]], [[Cambodia]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]], [[Maldives]], the [[Philippines]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Timor-Leste]] and [[Vietnam]]. 

In the Pacific region, it is endemic in [[American Samoa]], the [[Cook Islands]], [[Fiji]], [[French Polynesia]], [[Micronesia]], [[Niue]], [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and [[Vanuatu]].  

In many of these countries, considerable progress has been made towards elimination of filariasis. Elimination of the disease may have been achieved in several countries, but awaits official confirmation by the [[WHO]].

==History==
Lymphatic filariasis is thought to have affected humans since about 4000 years ago.<ref name="titleLymphatic Filariasis Discovery">{{Citation |url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/humbio103/ParaSites2006/Lymphatic_filariasis/Discovery.htm |title=Lymphatic Filariasis Discovery |accessdate=2008-11-21 |work=}}</ref>  Artifacts from ancient Egypt (2000 BC) and the [[Nok culture|Nok civilization]] in West Africa (500 BC) show possible elephantiasis symptoms.  The first clear reference to the disease occurs in ancient Greek literature, where scholars differentiated the often similar symptoms of lymphatic filariasis from those of [[leprosy]].

The first documentation of symptoms occurred in the 16th century, when [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]] wrote about the disease during the exploration of Goa.  Similar symptoms were reported by subsequent explorers in areas of Asia and Africa, though an understanding of the disease did not begin to develop until centuries later.

In 1866, [[Timothy Lewis]], building on the work of [[Jean-Nicolas Demarquay]] and [[O. E. H. Wucherer|Otto Henry Wucherer]], made the connection between microfilariae and elephantiasis, establishing the course of research that would ultimately explain the disease.  In 1876, [[Joseph Bancroft]] discovered the adult form of the worm.  In 1877, the lifecycle involving an arthropod vector was theorized by [[Patrick Manson]], who proceeded to demonstrate the presence of the worms in mosquitoes.  Manson incorrectly hypothesized that the disease was transmitted through skin contact with water in which the mosquitoes had laid eggs. In 1900, [[George Carmichael Low]] determined the actual transmission method by discovering the presence of the worm in the proboscis of the mosquito vector.<ref name="titleLymphatic Filariasis Discovery"/>

==In other animals==
Filariasis can also affect [[domesticated animals]], such as [[cattle]], [[sheep]], and [[dogs]].

===In cattle===
* [[Verminous haemorrhagic dermatitis (cattle)|Verminous haemorrhagic dermatitis]] is a clinical disease in cattle due to ''Parafilaria bovicola''.
* Intradermal onchocercosis of cattle results in losses in [[leather]] due to ''Onchocerca dermata'', ''O. ochengi'', and ''O. dukei''. ''O. ochengi'' is closely related to human ''O. volvulus'' ([[river blindness]]), sharing the same vector, and could be useful in human medicine research.
* ''Stenofilaria assamensis'' and others  cause different diseases in Asia, in cattle and [[zebu]].

===In horses===
* "Summer bleeding" is hemorrhagic subcutaneous nodules in the head and upper forelimbs, caused by ''[[Parafilaria multipapillosa]]'' ([[North Africa]], [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Eastern Europe]], Asia and South America).

===In dogs===
* [[Heartworm|Heart filariasis]] is caused by ''Dirofilaria immitis''.
