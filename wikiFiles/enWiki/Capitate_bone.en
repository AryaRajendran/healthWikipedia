The '''capitate bone''' is the largest of the [[carpal]] bones in the [[human]] [[hand]], and occupies the center of the [[wrist]]. It presents, above, a rounded portion or head, which is received into the concavity formed by the [[scaphoid]] and [[lunate bone]]s; a constricted portion or neck; and below this, the body.<ref name="Gray's">''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'' (1918).  See infobox.</ref>
The bone is also found in many other mammals, and is [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the "third distal carpal" of reptiles and amphibians.

The etymology derives from the Latin ''capitƒÅtus'', "having a head," from ''capit-'', meaning "head."

== Surfaces ==
The ''superior surface'' is round, smooth, and articulates with the [[lunate bone]].<ref name="Gray's" />

The ''inferior surface'' is divided by two ridges into three facets, for articulation with the second, third, and fourth [[metacarpal bone]]s, that for the third being the largest.<ref name="Gray's" />

The ''dorsal surface'' is broad and rough.<ref name="Gray's" />

The ''palmar surface'' is narrow, rounded, and rough, for the attachment of ligaments and a part of the [[adductor pollicis muscle]].<ref name="Gray's" />

The ''lateral surface'' articulates with the lesser multangular by a small facet at its anterior inferior angle, behind which is a rough depression for the attachment of an [[Interosseous intercarpal ligaments|interosseous ligament]]. Above this is a deep, rough groove, forming part of the neck, and serving for the attachment of ligaments; it is bounded superiorly by a smooth, convex surface, for articulation with the [[scaphoid bone]].<ref name="Gray's" />

The ''medial surface'' articulates with the [[hamate bone]] by a smooth, concave, oblong facet, which occupies its posterior and superior parts; it is rough in front, for the attachment of an interosseous ligament.<ref name="Gray's" />

== Articulations ==
The capitate articulates with seven bones: the [[scaphoid bone|scaphoid]] and [[lunate bone|lunate]] proximally, the [[second metacarpal]], [[third metacarpal]], and [[fourth metacarpal]] distally, the lesser multangular on the radial side, and the hamate on the ulnar side.<ref name="Gray's" />
