'''Health care quality''' refers to a level of value of any health care resources as determined by some a measurement. The goal of health care is to provide medical resources of high quality to all who need them. Researchers use many different measures to attempt to determine health care quality, including counts of a therapy's reduction or lessening of diseases identified by [[medical diagnosis]], a decrease in the number of [[risk factors]] which people have following [[preventative care]], or a survey of [[health indicators]] in a population who are accessing certain kinds of care.

==History==
The modern field of determining health care quality began in about 1970 and became a much greater topic of interest by the mid 1990s.<ref name="Brook">{{cite doi|10.1056/NEJM199609263351311}}</ref>

==Areas for development==
Some areas for development which have been proposed to improve the accuracy and research of measures of health care quality are the following:
*systems for allowing patients to provide information into their medical records<ref name="Brook"/>
*systems for better allowing patients to request their medical records<ref name="Brook"/>
*standard algorithm for measuring quality<ref name="Brook"/>
*standard system for reporting results<ref name="Brook"/>
*development of public domain tool kits for use by physicians, administrators, and patient groups who want to participate in assessing and improving quality<ref name="Brook"/>
*an international effort so that all countries participate in developing their own national quality reports<ref name="Brook"/>
*for the 100 most common medical procedures, there should be a computer-based decision system which prompts physicians to ask patients standardized questions to decide whether to do a procedure, and this process should generate efficacy data<ref name="Brook"/>

==Identifying problems==
Researchers measure health care quality to identify problems caused by [[overutilization|over use]], under use, or misuse of health resources.<ref name="Chassin">{{cite doi|10.1001/jama.280.11.1000}}</ref>  A study in the United States found that quality problems existed with equal frequency in both large and small communities.<ref name="Chassin"/>

==Organizations which determine quality==
Organizations which work to set standards and measures for health care quality include [[Health systems by country|Government health systems]]; accreditation programs such as those for [[hospital accreditation]], [[health associations]], or those who wish to establish [[international healthcare accreditation]]; [[Foundation (nonprofit)|philanthropic foundations]]; and health research institutions.<ref name="Cleary">{{cite doi|10.1001/jama.1997.03550190072047}}</ref> These organizations seek to define the concept of quality in healthcare, measure that quality, and then encourage the regular measurement of quality so as to provide evidence that health interventions are effective.<ref name="Cleary"/>
