===Research advances===

Researchers affiliated with Siteman and/or Washington University School of Medicine have pioneered important advances in cancer research, prevention, education and treatment. Highlights and ongoing studies include these projects:

'''2013 — Endometrial cancer and leukemia'''

*In separate studies, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine and [[The Genome Institute]] help identify major genetic mutations that promote [[endometrial cancer]] and [[acute myeloid leukemia]]. The research, part of the [[The Cancer Genome Atlas]] project, provides new information that could change treatments for patients and aid drug development.<ref>{{cite news | last = Winslow | first = Ron | title = Genomic Studies Unlock Details on Two Cancers | newspaper = The Wall Street Journal | date = 1 May 2013 | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324582004578456701717954658.html | accessdate = 1 May 2013}}</ref>

'''2012 — Leukemia, breast cancer research and cancer prevention'''

*Siteman leukemia doctor Lukas Wartman, MD, who was diagnosed with the disease himself, goes into remission for an unprecedented third time after [[Timothy Ley]], M.D., and his colleagues at The Genome Institute sequenced Wartman’s cancerous and normal genes. Researchers also analyzed his [[RNA]]. By doing so, his treatment team, which includes John DiPersio, MD, PhD, deputy director of Siteman, discovered that a normal gene might be contributing to the growth of Wartman's cancer by producing mass amounts of a certain protein. They found that a drug used to treat a type of kidney cancer was able to inhibit the gene.<ref>{{cite news | last = Kolata | first = Gina | title = In Treatment for Leukemia, Glimpses of the Future | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 7 July 2012 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/health/in-gene-sequencing-treatment-for-leukemia-glimpses-of-the-future.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate = 20 July 2012}}{{cite episode | title = Frontiers in Cancer Research | episodelink = | url = http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/12455 | series = Charlie Rose | serieslink = | network = PBS | city = New York | airdate = 17 July 2012 | minutes = 28}}</ref>

*Scientists including Matthew Ellis, M.B., Ph.D., use [[whole genome sequencing]] to compare differences between the [[DNA]] of breast cancer tumors and healthy cells in 46 women.

'''2008 — Genetic sequencing'''

*For the first time, scientists decode all the genes of a cancer patient and find a suite of mutations that might have caused the disease or aided its progression. [[Timothy Ley]], M.D., [[Elaine Mardis]], Ph.D., [[Richard K. Wilson]], Ph.D., and their colleagues at [[The Genome Institute]] say the finding could lead to new therapies and could help doctors make better choices among existing treatments, based on a more detailed genetic picture of each patient's cancer. Though the research involved [[acute myelogenous leukemia]] (AML), the same techniques can also be used to study other cancers.<ref>{{cite news | last = Grady | first = Denise | title = Experts Decode Cancer Patient’s Genes, Seeking Treatment Clues  | newspaper = They New York Times | date = 6 November 2008 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E6D9123DF935A35752C1A96E9C8B63 | accessdate = 20 July 2012}}</ref>

'''2007 — Nanotechnology and radiation therapy'''

*Gregory Lanza, M.D., Ph.D., Samuel Wickline, M.D., and researchers in their labs announce the development of [[nanoparticles]], significantly smaller than the width of a human hair, aimed at attacking cancer by locating and “latching on” to tumors. Used in conjunction with [[magnetic resonance imaging]], the nanoparticles could help physicians monitor cancerous tissue and deliver medicine directly to the tumor, not to the rest of the body.<ref>{{cite news | title = Nanoparticles used to track cells | newspaper = UPI | date = 27 July 2007 | url = http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2007/03/27/Nanoparticles-used-to-track-cells/UPI-90741175008534/ | accessdate = 25 July 2012}}</ref>

'''2006 — Photoacoustic imaging'''

*Lihong Wang, Ph.D., announces his work on [[photoacoustic imaging]], a new technique that uses light and sound to create detailed, color pictures of tumors and organs. The noninvasive imaging technique, which can be performed without the dangers of radiation exposure associated with [[X-ray]] and [[CT scans]], also may help doctors detect cancer earlier than ever before, its developers say.<ref>{{cite video | people = Lihong Wang, Ph.D. | title = New technique brings cancer screening into sharper focus | medium = Web news | publisher = Reuters | location = St. Louis | date = 30 April 2012 | url = http://www.reuters.com/video/2012/04/30/new-technique-brings-cancer-screening-in?videoId=234198822 | accessdate = 25 June 2012}}ß</ref>

'''2003 — Breast cancer'''

*Thalachallour Mohanakumar, Ph.D., and other researchers at Siteman develop and test on mice a prototype vaccine that causes cancerous tumors to stop growing, then to shrink. The vaccine, which is being developed to fight breast cancer in humans, helps the immune system target a protein found in 80 percent of breast tumors.<ref>{{cite news | title = Breast cancer vaccine ready for tests soon | newspaper = The Daily Telegraph | date = 10 March 2005 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/3315963/Breast-cancer-vaccine-ready-for-tests-soon.html | accessdate = 15 June 2012}}</ref>

'''2001 — Imaging and the immune system’s role in controlling cancer'''

*Research led by Joanne Mortimer, M.D., shows that [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scans can often identify within two weeks which women with advanced breast cancer are likely to respond to [[hormone therapy]], a gentler alternative to chemotherapy that is usually just as effective.<ref>{{cite news | last = Hesman | first = Tina | title = Scan test may aid choice for breast cancer therapy | newspaper = St. Louis Post-Dispatch | location = St. Louis | pages = C5 | date = 15 June 2001 | accessdate = 26 June 2012}}</ref>
