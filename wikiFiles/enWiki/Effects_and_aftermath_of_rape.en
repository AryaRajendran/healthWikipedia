This article deals primarily with the female victims of male-on-female rape, and until such time as research into other variants added e.g. male-on-male, female-on-female, female-on-male. For male-on-female rape: The effects and aftermath of rape can include both [[physical trauma]] and [[psychological trauma]]. However, physical force is not necessarily used in [[rape]], and physical injuries are not always a consequence. Deaths associated with rape are known to occur, though the prevalence of fatalities varies considerably across the world. For rape victims the more common consequences of sexual violence are those related to reproductive health, [[mental health]], and social wellbeing.

===Pregnancy===
{{Main|Pregnancy from rape}}

* Pregnancy may result from rape. The rate varies between settings and depends particularly on the extent to which [[non-barrier contraceptives]] are being used. 
* In 1982, ''[[Fertility and Sterility]]'', the journal of the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine]], reported that the risk of pregnancy from a rape is the same as the risk of pregnancy from a consensual sexual encounter, 2-4%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Yuzpe|first=A.

* A 1996 [[longitudinal study]] in the [[United States]] of over 4000 women followed for three years found that the national rape related pregnancy rate was 5.0% per rape among victims aged 12–45 years, producing over 32,000 pregnancies nationally among women from rape each year.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9378(96)70141-2 | last1 = Holmes | first1 = MM | last2 = Resnick | year = 1996 | first2 = HS | last3 = Kilpatrick | first3 = DG | last4 = Best | first4 = CL | title = Rape-related pregnancy: estimates and descriptive characteristics from a national sample of women | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 175 | issue = 2| pages = 320–324 | pmid = 8765248 }}</ref> 
* In 1991, a study in a maternity hospital in [[Lima]] found that 90% of new mothers aged 12–16 had become pregnant from being raped, the majority by their father, stepfather or other close relative. An organization for teenage mothers in [[Costa Rica]] reported that 95% of its clients under the age of 15 had been victims of incest.<ref>{{cite book|first=ed. by Laura L.

* Experience of coerced sex at an early age reduces a woman's ability to see her sexuality as something over which she has control.

===Sexually transmitted diseases===

Violent or forced sex can increase the risk of transmitting [[HIV]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199003153221101 | last1 = Jenny | first1 = C | last2 = Hooton | year = 1990 | first2 = TM | last3 = Bowers | first3 = A | last4 = Copass | first4 = MK | last5 = Krieger | first5 = JN | last6 = Hillier | first6 = SL | last7 = Kiviat | first7 = N | last8 = Corey | first8 = L | last9 = Stamm | first9 = WE | title = Sexually transmitted diseases in victims of rape | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 322 | issue = 11| pages = 713–716 | pmid = 2155389 }}</ref> In forced vaginal penetration, abrasions and cuts commonly occur, thus facilitating the entry of the virus through the [[vaginal mucosa]]. Adolescent girls are particularly susceptible to HIV infection through forced sex, and even through unforced sex, because their vaginal mucous membranes have not yet acquired cellular density sufficient to provide an effective barrier that develops in the later teenage years.

Being a victim of sexual violence and being susceptible to HIV share a number of risk behaviors. Forced sex in childhood or adolescence, for instance, increases the likelihood of engaging in unprotected sex, having multiple partners, participating in sex work, and substance abuse. People who experience forced sex in intimate relationships often find it difficult to negotiate condom use either because using a condom could be interpreted as mistrust of their partners or as an admission of promiscuity, or else because they fear experiencing violence from their partners. Sexual coercion among adolescents and adults is also associated with low self-esteem and depression factors that are associated with many of the risk behaviors for HIV infection.

Research on women in shelters has shown that women who experience both sexual and physical abuse from intimate partners are significantly more likely to have had sexually transmitted diseases.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0749-3797(00)00228-2 |

==Male-on-Female rape: Psychological impact==
{{main|Rape trauma syndrome}}

===Self-blame===
{{main|Blame#Self-blame}}
'''Self-blame''' is among the most common of both short- and long-term effects and functions as an avoidance [[Coping (psychology)|coping skill]] that inhibits the healing process and can often be remedied by a [[cognitive therapy]] technique known as [[cognitive restructuring]].

There are two main types of self-blame: behavioral self-blame (undeserved blame based on actions) and characterological self-blame (undeserved blame based on character). Victims who experience behavioral self-blame feel that they should have done something differently, and therefore feel at fault. Victims who experience characterological self-blame feel there is something inherently wrong with them which has caused them to deserve to be assaulted.

Unfortunately, the victim's support system is not always the best place for the victim to seek consolation. Sometimes in an effort to shield oneself from believing such a thing could happen to their loved one, a supporter will make excuses for why the event occurred. Some support will decide that the victim put themselves in a bad situation, even though they didn't deserve to be raped- which does not help the victim in his or her recovery to hear. The victim will often already internally blame themselves, especially because the violation of boundaries, broken trust, and the feeling of personal danger occurs with rape. If the support system they look to for support is a partner or spouse, some may be unwilling to accept reality and leave or blame the victim. In that situation, it is even more important to be able to find support in others. 

Most victims cannot be reassured enough that what happened to them is "not their fault." This helps them fight through shame and feel safe, secure, and grieve in a healthy way. In most cases, a length of time, and often therapy, are necessary to allow the victim and people close to the victim to process and heal.

A leading researcher on the psychological causes and effects of [[shame]], June Tangney, lists five ways shame can be destructive:<ref name=tagney/> 
*lack of motivation to seek care;
*lack of [[empathy]];
*cutting themselves off from other people;
*[[anger]];
*[[aggression]].
Tangney says shame has a special link to anger. "In day-to-day life, when people are shamed and angry they tend to be motivated to get back at a person and get revenge."

In addition, shame is connected to psychological problems – such as eating disorders, substance abuse, anxiety, depression, and other mental disorders as well as problematic moral behavior. In one study over several years shame-prone kids were prone to substance abuse, earlier sexual activity, less safe sexual activity, and involvement with the criminal justice system.<ref name=tagney>Tangney, June Price and Dearing, Ronda L., Shame and Guilt, The Guilford Press, 2002 ISBN 1-57230-987-3</ref>

Behavioral self-blame is associated with feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] within the victim. While the belief that one had control during the assault (past control) is associated with greater psychological distress, the belief that one has more control during the recovery process (present control) is associated with less distress, less withdrawal, and more cognitive reprocessing.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-0167.52.3.267 | last1 = Frazier | year = 2005 | first1 = Patricia A. | last2 = Mortensen | first2 = Heather | last3 = Steward | first3 = Jason | title= Coping Strategies as Mediators of the Relations Among Perceived Control and Distress in Sexual Assault Survivors |journal = Journal of Counseling Psychology |volume= 52 |issue=3 |pages= 267–278 }}</ref>

Counseling responses found helpful in reducing self-blame are supportive responses, psychoeducational responses (learning about rape trauma syndrome) and those responses addressing the issue of blame.<ref>Matsushita-Arao, Yoshiko. (1997). Self-blame and depression among forcible rape survivors. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering. 57(9-B). pp. 5925.</ref> A helpful type of therapy for self-blame is cognitive restructuring or cognitive-behavioral therapy. Cognitive reprocessing is the process of taking the facts and forming a logical conclusion from them that is less influenced by shame or guilt.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1207/S15324834BASP2504_1 | last1=Branscombe | year=2003 | first1=Nyla | last2=Wohl | first2=Michael | last3=Owen | first3=Susan | last4=Allison | first4=Julie | last5=N'gbala | first5=Ahogni |title= Counterfactual Thinking, Blame Assignment, and Well-Being in Rape Victims | journal = Basic & Applied Social Psychology | volume= 25 | issue = 4 | pages= 265–273 }}</ref>

===Suicide===
Childhood and adulthood victims of rape are more likely to attempt or commit [[suicide]].<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Davidson JR et al.| title = The association of sexual assault and attempted suicide within the community | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 53 | issue = 6| pages = 550–555 | pmid = 8639039 | year=1996 | month=June}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/353667 | author = Luster T and Small SA | year = 1997 | title = Sexual abuse history and problems in adolescence: exploring the effects of moderating variables| journal = Journal of Marriage and the Family | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 131–142 | jstor = 353667 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.277.17.1362 | author= McCauley J et al.| title = Clinical characteristics of women with a history of childhood abuse: unhealed wounds | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 277 | issue = 17| pages = 1362–1368 | pmid = 9134941 }}</ref> The association remains, even after controlling for sex, age, education, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and the presence of psychiatric disorders.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Nagy S et al. | year = 1994 | title = A comparison of risky health behaviors of sexually active, sexually abused, and abstaining adolescents | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 93 | issue = 4| pages = 570–575 | pmid = 8134211 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | author= Romans SE et al.| title = Sexual abuse in childhood and deliberate self-harm | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 152 | issue = 9| pages = 1336–1342 | pmid = 7653690 | year=1995 | month=September}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wiederman | first1 = MW | last2 = Sansone | first2 = RA | last3 = Sansone | first3 = LA. | year = 1998 | title = History of trauma and attempted suicide among women in a primary care setting | journal = Violence and Victims | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 3–9 | pmid = 9650241 }}</ref> The experience of being raped can lead to suicidal behavior as early as adolescence.

==Male-on-Female rape: Sociological impact==
===Secondary victimization===
Rape is especially [[Social stigma|stigmatizing]] in cultures with strong customs and [[taboos]] regarding sex and sexuality. For example, a rape victim (especially one who was previously a [[virgin]]) may be viewed by society as being "damaged." Victims in these cultures may suffer [[solitude|isolation]], be disowned by friends and family, be prohibited from marrying, be divorced if already married, or even killed. This phenomenon is known as secondary [[victimization]].<ref>[http://www.nycagainstrape.org/survivors_factsheet_49.html#6 Alliance: Factsheets: Trauma of Victimization]. Nycagainstrape.org. Retrieved on 2011-10-01.</ref> 

Secondary victimization is the re-traumatization of the sexual assault, abuse, or rape victim through the responses of individuals and institutions. Types of secondary victimization include victim blaming and inappropriate post-assault behavior or language by medical personnel or other organizations with which the victim has contact.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=10606433|journal=Violence Vict. |year=1999|volume=14|issue=3|pages=261–75|title=Secondary victimization of rape victims: insights from mental health professionals who treat survivors of violence|author=Campbell R, Raja S.}}</ref> Secondary victimization is especially common in cases of [[date rape drug|drug-facilitated]], [[date rape|acquaintance]], and [[statutory rape]].

===Victim blaming===
{{main|Victim blaming}}
The term ''victim blaming'' refers to holding the victim of a crime to be responsible for that crime, either in whole or in part. In the context of rape, it refers to the attitude that certain victim behaviors (such as [[flirting]] or wearing sexually provocative clothing) may have encouraged the assault. In extreme cases, victims are said to have "asked for it" simply by not behaving demurely.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

It has been proposed that one cause of victim blaming is the ''[[just world hypothesis]]''. People who believe that the world is intrinsically fair may find it difficult or impossible to accept a situation in which a person is badly hurt for no reason. This leads to a sense that victims must have done something to deserve their fate. Another theory entails the psychological need to protect one's own sense of invulnerability, which can inspire people to believe that rape only happens to those who provoke the assault. Believers use this as a way to feel safer: If one avoids the behaviours of the past victims, one will be less vulnerable. A global survey of attitudes toward sexual violence by the [[Global Forum for Health Research]] shows that victim-blaming concepts are at least partially accepted in many countries.

It has also been proposed by Dr Roxanne Agnew- Davies, a clinical psychologist and an expert on the effects of sexual violence, that victim-blaming correlates with fear. "It is not surprising when so many rape victims blame themselves. Female jurors can look at the woman in the witness stand and decide she has done something 'wrong' such as flirting or having a drink with the defendant. She can therefore reassure herself that rape won't happen to her as long as she does nothing similar."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmainteractive.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=27312&Itemid=3158 |title=EMMA - Most Londoners Believe Rape Victims are to Blame |publisher=Emmainteractive.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-24}}</ref>

Many of the countries in which victim blaming is more common are those in which there is a [[sexism|significant social divide]] between the freedoms and status afforded to men and women.

===In Islamic countries===
Rape is forbidden under Islamic law.<ref>Uzma Mazhar (2002) [http://www.muslimaccess.com/articles/Women/rape_in_islam.asp Rape & Incest: Islamic Perspective]</ref> Some female rape victims are accused and punished for having sex outside of marriage. 
* "Local [[Sharia]] courts in some third world countries regularly punish raped minor girls and women by flogging and beating them with shoes."<ref>[http://www.aina.org/news/20081117111817.htm How Sharia Law Punishes Raped Women]. Aina.org. Retrieved on 2011-10-01.</ref>

* "In 1979, the government of Pakistan adopted the ''Zina'' Ordinance to bring the Penal Code into accord with Islamic principles. Under this ordinance, women who report having been raped must prove that the intercourse was without consent. If unable to prove this lack of consent, they can be charged with fornication. As a result, women are less likely to report rape ..."<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/geoimlj12&div=26&id=&page= |title=Women Persecuted under Islamic Law: The Zina Ordinance in Pakistan as a Basis for Asylum Claims in the United States|journal=Georgetown Immigration Law Journal|page=379 |year=1998|author=Polk, Michael F. |volume=12}}</ref>

Some rights advocates say that this aspect of [[Sharia law]] "not only negates the rights of women but is also a misinterpretation of [[Islam]]."<ref>[http://www.jihadwatch.org/2006/07/will-pakistan-ease-harsh-sharia-rape-laws.html Will Pakistan ease harsh Sharia rape laws?]. Jihad Watch. July 2006</ref> (see also [[Hudood Ordinance]].)

Mainstream Sunni Islamic scholars, like Imam Malik, clearly state that no punishment is applied on the raped women.
