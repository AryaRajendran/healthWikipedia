The '''history of virology''' – the scientific study of viruses and the infections they cause – begins  in the closing years of the 19th century. Although [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Edward Jenner]] developed the first [[vaccine]]s to protect against viral infections, they did not know that viruses existed. The first evidence of the existence of viruses came from experiments with  filters that had pores small enough to retain bacteria.  In 1892, [[Dmitry Ivanovsky]]  used one of these filters to show that sap from a diseased [[tobacco plant]] remained infectious to healthy tobacco plants despite having been filtered. [[Martinus Beijerinck]] called the filtered, infectious substance a "virus" and this discovery is considered to be the beginning of [[virology]]. In the 20th century many viruses were discovered.

Despite his other successes, [[Louis Pasteur]] (1822–1895) was unable to find a causative agent for [[rabies]] and speculated about a pathogen too small to be detected using a microscope.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bordenave G |title=Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) |journal=Microbes and Infection / Institut Pasteur |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=553–60 |year=2003 |month=May |pmid=12758285 |doi=10.1016/S1286-4579(03)00075-3}}</ref> In 1884, the French [[microbiologist]] [[Charles Chamberland]] (1851–1931) invented a filter – known today as the [[Chamberland filter]] – that had pores smaller than bacteria.

In 1892, the Russian biologist [[Dmitry Ivanovsky]] (1864–1920) used this filter to study what is now known as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]]. His experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration. Ivanovsky suggested the infection might be caused by a [[toxin]] produced by bacteria, but did not pursue the idea.<ref name="Collier 3">{{cite book |author=Sussman, Max; Topley, W. W.

In 1881, [[Carlos Finlay]]  (1833–1915), a Cuban physician, first suggested that mosquitoes were carrying the cause of yellow fever,<ref name="pmid2684378">{{cite journal |author=Chiong MA |title=Dr. Carlos Finlay and yellow fever |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=141 |issue=11 |page=1126 |year=1989 |month=December |pmid=2684378 |pmc=1451274}}</ref> a theory that was proved in 1900 by [[Walter Reed]] (1851–1902).

By 1928 enough was known about viruses to enable the publication of ''Filterable Viruses'', a collection of essays covering all known viruses edited by [[Thomas Milton Rivers]] (1888–1962). Rivers, who survived [[typhoid fever]] at the age of twelve, went on to have a distinguished career in virology. In 1926, he was invited to speak at a meeting organised by the Society of American Bacteriology where he said for the first time, "Viruses appear to be obligate parasites in the sense that their reproduction is dependent on living cells."<ref>[http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/trivers.pdf Frank L.

That viruses were particles was not considered unnatural and fitted in nicely with the [[Germ theory of disease|germ theory]]. It is assumed that Dr. J. Buist of Edinburgh was the first person to see virus particles in 1886, when he reported seeing "micrococci" in vaccine lymph. But he had  probably seen clumps of [[vaccinia virus]].<ref>*In 1887, Buist visualised one of the largest, Vaccinia virus, by optical microscopy after staining it. Vaccinia was not known to be a virus at that time. (Buist J.B.(1887) ''Vaccinia and Variola: a study of their life history'' Churchill, London)</ref> In the years that followed, as optical microscopes were improved "inclusion bodies" were seen in many virus-infected cells, but these aggregates of virus particles were still too small to reveal any detailed structure. It was not until the invention of [[electron microscopy|the electron microscope]] in 1931 by the German engineers [[Ernst Ruska]] (1906–1988) and [[Max Knoll]] (1887–1969),<ref>From ''Nobel Lectures, Physics 1981–1990'', (1993) Editor-in-Charge Tore Frängsmyr, Editor Gösta Ekspång, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore.</ref> that virus particles, especially [[bacteriophage]]s, were shown to have a complex structure. The sizes of viruses determined using this new microscope fitted in well with those estimated by filtration experiments. Viruses were expected to be small, but the range of sizes came as a surprise. Some were only a little smaller than the smallest known bacteria, and the smaller viruses were of similar sizes to complex organic molecules.<ref>{{cite book |author=Carr, N. G.; Mahy, B. W.

In Pasteur's day, and for many years after his death the word "virus" was used to describe any cause of infectious disease. Painstaking work, by many [[bacteriologist]]s, soon discovered the cause of numerous infections. However, some infections remained, many of them horrendous, but for which no bacterial cause could be found. These agents were invisible and could only be grown in living animals. The discovery of viruses was the key that unlocked the door that withheld the secrets of the cause of these mysterious infections. And, although [[Koch's postulates]] could not be fulfilled for many of these infections, this did not stop the pioneer virologists from looking for viruses in infections for which no other cause could be found.<ref>{{cite book |author=Carr, N.

==Bacteriophages==

===Discovery===
Bacteriophages are the viruses that infect and reproduce in bacteria. They were discovered in the early 20th century, by the English bacteriologist [[Frederick Twort]] (1877–1950).<ref name="Shors 589 ">{{cite book |author=Teri Shors |title=Understanding Viruses |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers |location=Sudbury, Mass |year=2008 |page=589 |isbn=0-7637-2932-9}}</ref> But before this time, in 1896, the bacteriologist [[Ernest Hanbury Hankin]] (1865–1939) reported that something in the waters of the [[River Ganges]] could kill ''[[Vibrio cholera]]'' – the cause of [[cholera]]. Whatever it was in the water could be passed through filters that remove bacteria but was destroyed by boiling.<ref name = "Ackerman p3">{{cite book |author=Ackermann H-W |title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology |publisher=Academic Press |location=Oxford |year=2009 |page=3|isbn=0-12-375146-2 }}</ref> Twort  discovered the action of bacteriophages on [[staphylococcus|staphylococci]] bacteria. He noticed that when grown on nutrient agar some colonies of the bacteria became watery or "glassy". He collected some of these watery colonies and passed them through a Chamberland filter to remove the bacteria and discovered that when the filtrate was added to fresh cultures of bacteria, they in turn became watery.<ref name="Shors 589 "/> He proposed that the agent might be "an amoeba, an ultramicroscopic virus, a living protoplasm, or an enzyme with the power of growth".<ref name = "Ackerman p3"/>

Félix d'Herelle (1873–1949) was a mainly self-taught French-Canadian microbiologist. In 1917 he discovered that "an invisible antagonist", when added to bacteria on [[agar]], would produce areas of dead bacteria.<ref name="Shors 589 "/> The antagonist, now known to be a bacteriophage could pass through a Chamberland filter. He accurately diluted a suspension of these viruses and discovered that the highest dilutions (lowest virus concentrations), rather than killing all the bacteria, formed discrete areas of dead organisms. Counting these areas and multiplying by the dilution factor allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the original suspension.<ref name="D'Herelle F 2007">{{cite journal | pmid = 17855060 | doi=10.1016/j.resmic.2007.07.005 | volume=158 | issue=7 | year=2007 | month=September | pages=553–4 | author=D'Herelle F | title = On an invisible microbe antagonistic toward dysenteric bacilli: brief note by Mr. F.

Between 1918 and 1921 d'Herelle discovered different types of bacteriophages that could infect several other species of bacteria including ''Vibrio cholera''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ackermann H-W |title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology |publisher=Academic Press |location=Oxford |year=2009 |page=4 Table 1|isbn=0-12-375146-2 }}</ref>  Bacteriophages were heralded as a potential treatment for diseases such as [[typhoid]] and [[cholera]], but their promise was forgotten with the development of [[penicillin]].<ref name="Ackermann H-W 2009 4"/> Since the early 1970s, bacteria have continued to develop resistance to [[antibiotic]]s such as [[penicillin]], and this has led to a renewed interest in the use of [[phage therapy|bacteriophages to treat serious infections]].<ref name="Shors 591 ">{{cite book |author=Teri Shors |title=Understanding Viruses |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers |location=Sudbury, Mass |year=2008 |page=591|isbn=0-7637-2932-9}}</ref>

===Early research 1920–1940===
[[File:Felix d'Herelle.png|right|thumb|Felix d'Herelle]]
D'Herelle travelled widely to promote the use of bacteriophages in the treatment of bacterial infections. In 1928, he became professor of biology at [[Yale]] and  founded several research institutes.<ref name="Shors 590 ">{{cite book |author=Teri Shors |title=Understanding Viruses |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers |location=Sudbury, Mass |year=2008 |page=590|isbn=0-7637-2932-9}}</ref> He was convinced that bacteriophages were viruses despite opposition from established bacteriologists such as  the Nobel Prize winner [[Jules Bordet]] (1870–1961). Bordet argued that bacteriophages were not viruses but just [[enzyme]]s released from [[lysogenic cycle|"lysogenic"]] bacteria. He said "the invisible world of d'Herelle does not exist".<ref>Quoted in: {{cite book |author=Ackermann H-W |title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology |publisher=Academic Press |location=Oxford |year=2009 |page=4|isbn=0-12-375146-2 }}</ref>  But in the 1930s, the proof that bacteriophages were viruses was provided by [[Christopher Andrewes]] (1896–1988) and others. They showed that these viruses differed in size and in their chemical and [[serology|serological]] properties.
In 1940, the first [[electron microscope|electron micrograph]] image of a bacteriophage was published and this silenced sceptics who had argued that bacteriophages were relatively simple enzymes and not viruses.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ackermann H-W |title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology |publisher=Academic Press |location=Oxford |year=2009 |pages=3–5|isbn=0-12-375146-2 }}</ref>
Numerous other types of bacteriophages were quickly discovered and were shown to infect bacteria wherever they are found. But this early research was interrupted by [[World War II]]. Even d'Herelle was silenced. Despite his Canadian citizenship, he was interned by the [[Vichy France|Vichy Government]] until the end of the war.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ackermann H-W |title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology |publisher=Academic Press |location=Oxford |year=2009 |page=5|isbn=0-12-375146-2 }}</ref>

===Modern era===
Knowledge of  bacteriophages increased in the 1940s following the formation of the [[Phage group|Phage Group]] by scientists throughout the US. Among the members were [[Max Delbrück]] (1906–1981) who founded a course on bacteriophages at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]].<ref name="Shors 591 "/>  Other key members of the Phage Group included [[Salvador Luria]] (1912–1991) and [[Alfred Hershey]] (1908–1997). During the 1950s, [[Hershey–Chase experiment|Hershey and Chase]] made important discoveries on the replication of DNA during their studies on  a bacteriophage  called [[Enterobacteria phage T2|T2]]. Together with Delbruck they were jointly awarded the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for their discoveries concerning the replication mechanism and the genetic structure of viruses".<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1969/ Nobel Organisation]</ref> Since then, the study of bacteriophages has provided insights into the switching on and off of genes, and a useful mechanism for introducing foreign genes into bacteria and many other fundamental mechanisms of [[molecular biology]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Ackermann H-W |title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology |publisher=Academic Press |location=Oxford |year=2009 |pages=5–10 Table 1|isbn=0-12-375146-2 }}</ref>

==Plant viruses==
In 1882, [[Adolf Mayer]] (1843–1942) described a condition of tobacco plants, which he called  "mosaic disease" ("mozaïkziekte"). The diseased plants had [[variegation|variegated]] leaves that were [[mottle]]d.<ref>Mayer A (1882) Over de moza¨ıkziekte van de tabak: voorloopige mededeeling. Tijdschr
Landbouwkunde Groningen 2: 359–364 (In German)</ref> He excluded the possibility of a fungal infection and could not detect any bacterium and speculated that a "soluble, enzyme-like infectious principle was involved".<ref name="pmid16732421">Quoted in: {{cite journal |author=van der Want JP, Dijkstra J |title=A history of plant virology |journal=Archives of Virology|volume=151 |issue=8 |pages=1467–98 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16732421 |doi=10.1007/s00705-006-0782-3}}</ref> He did not pursue his idea any further, and it was the filtration experiments of Ivanovsky and Beijerinck that suggested the cause was a previously unrecognised infectious agent. After tobacco mosaic was recognized as a virus disease, virus infections of many other plants were discovered.<ref name="pmid16732421"/>

The importance of tobacco mosaic virus in the history of viruses cannot be overstated. It was the first virus to be discovered, and the first to be [[crystal]]lised and its structure shown in detail. The first [[X-ray diffraction]] pictures of the crystallised virus were obtained by Bernal and Fankuchen in 1941. On the basis of her pictures, [[Rosalind Franklin]] discovered the full structure of the virus in 1955.<ref name="pmid18702397">{{cite journal|author=Creager AN, Morgan GJ|title=After the double helix: Rosalind Franklin's research on Tobacco mosaic virus|journal=Isis

By 1935 many plant diseases were thought to be caused by viruses. In 1922, [[John Kunkel Small]] (1869–1938) discovered that insects could act as [[vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] and transmit virus to plants.

In 1970, the Russian plant virologist [[Joseph Atabekov]] discovered that many plant viruses only infect a single species of host plant.<ref name="pmid11718380"/> The [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] now recognises over 900 plant viruses.<ref name="Shors 564 ">{{cite book |author=Teri Shors |title=Understanding Viruses |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers |location=Sudbury, Mass |year=2008 |page=564 |isbn=0-7637-2932-9}}</ref>

==20th century==

By the end of the 19th century, viruses were defined in terms of their [[infectivity]], their ability to be filtered, and their requirement for living hosts. Up until this time, viruses had only been grown in plants and animals, but in 1906, [[Ross Granville Harrison]] (1870–1959) invented a method for growing [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] in [[lymph]],<ref>[http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/rharrison.pdf J.

===Poliomyelitis===
{{main|Poliomyelitis}}
In 1949, [[John F. Enders]] (1897–1985) [[Thomas Huckle Weller|Thomas Weller]] (1915–2008), and [[Frederick Robbins]] (1916–2003) grew polio virus for the first time in cultured human embryo cells, the first virus to be grown without using solid animal tissue or eggs. Infections by poliovirus most often cause the mildest of symptoms. This was not known until the virus was isolated in cultured cells and many people were shown to have had mild infections that did not lead to poliomyelitis. But, unlike other viral infections, the incidence of polio – the rarer severe form of the infection – increased in the 20th century and reached a peak around 1952. The invention of a [[cell culture]] system for growing the virus enabled  [[Jonas Salk]] (1914–1995) to make an effective [[polio vaccine]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rosen FS | year = 2004 | title = Isolation of poliovirus—John Enders and the Nobel Prize | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 351 | issue = 15| pages = 1481–83 | pmid = 15470207 | doi=10.1056/NEJMp048202}}</ref>

===Epstein–Barr virus===
[[Denis Parsons Burkitt]] (1911–1993) was born in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Ireland. He was the first to describe a type of cancer that now bears his name [[Burkitt's lymphoma]]. This type of cancer was endemic in equatorial Africa and was the commonest malignancy of children in the early 1960s.<ref name="pmid19620863">{{cite journal |author=Magrath I |title=Lessons from clinical trials in African Burkitt lymphoma |journal=Current Opinion in Oncology |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=462–8 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19620863 |doi=10.1097/CCO.0b013e32832f3dcd}}</ref> In an attempt to find a cause for the cancer, Burkitt sent cells from the tumour to [[Anthony Epstein]] (b. 1921) a British virologist, who along with [[Yvonne Barr]] and [[Bert Achong]] (1928–1996), and after many failures, discovered viruses that resembled herpes virus in the fluid that surrounded the cells. The virus was later shown to be a previously unrecognised herpes virus, which is now called [[Epstein–Barr virus]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Epstein |first= M. Anthony |authorlink= M.
