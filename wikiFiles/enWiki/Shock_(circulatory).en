'''Circulatory shock''', commonly known simply as '''shock''', is a life-threatening [[medical]] condition that occurs due to inadequate [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] for [[Cellular_respiration#Aerobic_respiration|aerobic cellular respiration]].<ref name=EMB05/> In the early stages this is generally an inadequate tissue level of [[oxygen]].<ref name=Tint10>{{cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli))|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=165–172|isbn=0-07-148480-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

The typical signs of shock are [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], a [[tachycardia|rapid heartbeat]] and signs of poor end-organ [[perfusion]] or "decompensation/peripheral shut down" (such as low urine output, confusion or loss of consciousness). There are times that a person's blood pressure may remain stable, but may still be in circulatory shock, so it is not always a sign.<ref name=Guyton>{{cite book |last1=Guyton |first1=Arthur |last2=Hall |first2=John |editor1-first=Rebecca |editor1-last=Gruliow |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |edition=11th |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier Inc. |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=0-7216-0240-1 |pages=278–288  |chapter=Chapter 24: Circulatory Shock and Physiology of Its Treatment}}</ref>

Circulatory shock is not related to the [[shock (psychological)|emotional state of shock]]. Circulatory shock is a life-threatening [[medical emergency]] and one of the most common causes of death for critically ill people. Shock can have a variety of effects, all with similar outcomes, but all relate to a problem with the body's circulatory system. For example, shock may lead to [[hypoxemia]] (a lack of oxygen in arterial blood) or [[cardiac arrest]].<ref name="Marino">{{cite book |last = Marino |first = Paul L. |title = The ICU Book  |url = http://www.lww.com/product/?978-0-7817-4802-5 |publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia & London |year = 2006 |month = September |isbn = 0-7817-4802-X}}</ref>

One of the key dangers of shock is that it progresses by a [[positive feedback]] mechanism. Once shock begins, it tends to make itself worse, so immediate treatment of shock is critical to the survival of the sufferer.<ref name=Guyton/>
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Signs and symptoms==
The presentation of shock is variable with some people having only minimal symptoms such as confusion and weakness.<ref name=Tint10/> While the general signs for all types of shock are [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], decreased urine output, and confusion these may not always be present.<ref name=Tint10/> While a fast heart rate is common, those on [[Beta blocker|β-blockers]], those who are athletic and in 30% of cases those with shock due to intra abdominal bleeding may have a normal or slow heart rate.<ref name=Tint10,2>{{cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli))|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=174–175 |isbn=0-07-148480-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Specific subtypes of shock may have additional symptoms.

===Hypovolemic===
{{Class of Hemorrhage}}
Direct loss of effective circulating blood volume leading to:
*A rapid, weak, thready pulse due to decreased blood flow combined with tachycardia
*Cool, clammy skin due to [[vasoconstriction]] and stimulation of vasoconstriction
*Rapid and shallow breathing due to sympathetic nervous system stimulation and acidosis
*[[Hypothermia]] due to decreased perfusion and evaporation of sweat
*Thirst and dry mouth, due to fluid depletion and
*Cold and mottled skin ([[Livedo reticularis]]), especially extremities, due to insufficient perfusion of the skin

The severity of hemorrhagic shock can be graded on a 1-4 scale on the physical signs. This approximates to the effective loss of blood volume.

===Cardiogenic===
*Distended [[jugular vein]]s due to increased [[jugular venous pressure]]
*Weak or absent pulse
*[[Arrhythmia]], often tachycardic
*[[Pulsus paradoxus]] in case of [[Cardiac tamponade|tamponade]]

===Distributive===
{{SIRS}}
Distributive shock includes [[Sepsis|infectious]], [[Anaphalaxis|anaphylactic]], [[Endocrine]] and [[Neurogenic shock|neurogenic]] causes. The [[Systemic inflammatory response syndrome|SIRS]] features typically occur in early septic shock.<ref name=Tint10/>

====Anaphylaxis====
*[[Hives]] may present on the skin
*Localised [[edema]], especially around the face
*Weak and rapid pulse
*Breathlessness and cough due to [[bronchospasm|narrowing of airways]] and [[oedema|swelling of the throat]]

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Shock-cell2.svg|500px|thumb|Effects of inadequate perfusion on cell function.]]

There are four stages of shock. As it is a complex and continuous condition there is no sudden transition from one stage to the next.<ref name="Armstrong">{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=D.J.|year=2004|title=Shock|location=In: Alexander, M.F., Fawcett, J.N., Runciman, P.J. ''Nursing Practice. Hospital and Home. The Adult.''(2nd edition)|publisher=Edinburgh: Churchill Livingstone}}</ref> At a cellular level shock is oxygen demand greater than oxygen supply.<ref name=Tint10/>

===Initial===
During this stage, the state of hypoperfusion causes [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. Due to the lack of oxygen, the cells perform [[lactic acid fermentation]]. Since oxygen, the terminal electron acceptor in the electron transport chain is not abundant, this slows down entry of [[pyruvate]] into the [[Citric acid cycle|Krebs cycle]], resulting in its accumulation. Accumulating pyruvate is converted to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase and hence lactate accumulates (causing [[lactic acidosis]]).

===Compensatory===
This stage is characterised by the body employing physiological mechanisms, including neural, hormonal and bio-chemical mechanisms in an attempt to reverse the condition.  As a result of the [[acidosis]], the person will begin to [[hyperventilate]] in order to rid the body of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).  CO<sub>2</sub> indirectly acts to acidify the blood and by removing it the body is attempting to raise the pH of the blood.  The [[baroreceptors]] in the [[artery|arteries]] detect the resulting [[hypotension]], and cause the release of [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]]. Norepinephrine causes predominately [[vasoconstriction]] with a mild increase in [[heart rate]], whereas [[epinephrine]] predominately causes an increase in [[heart rate]] with a small effect on the [[Blood vessel|vascular]] tone; the combined effect results in an increase in [[blood pressure]]. [[Renin]]-[[angiotensin]] axis is activated and [[arginine vasopressin]] ([[Anti-diuretic hormone]]; ADH) is released to conserve fluid via the kidneys.  These hormones cause the vasoconstriction of the [[kidneys]], [[gastrointestinal tract]], and other organs to divert blood to the heart, [[lungs]] and [[brain]].  The lack of blood to the [[renal]] system causes the characteristic low [[urine]] production. However the effects of the [[Renin]]-[[angiotensin]] axis take time and are of little importance to the immediate [[homeostatic]] mediation of shock.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Progressive===
Should the cause of the crisis not be successfully treated, the shock will proceed to the progressive stage and the compensatory mechanisms begin to fail.  Due to the decreased perfusion of the cells, [[sodium]] ions build up within while [[potassium]] ions leak out. As anaerobic metabolism continues, increasing the body's metabolic acidosis, the arteriolar smooth muscle and precapillary [[sphincters]] relax such that blood remains in the [[capillaries]].<ref name=Robbins>Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; & Mitchell, Richard N. (2007). ''Robbins Basic Pathology'' (8th ed.). Saunders Elsevier. pp. 102-103 ISBN 978-1-4160-2973-1</ref>  Due to this, the hydrostatic pressure will increase and, combined with [[histamine]] release, this will lead to leakage of fluid and [[protein]] into the surrounding tissues.  As this fluid is lost, the blood concentration and [[viscosity]] increase, causing sludging of the micro-circulation. The prolonged vasoconstriction will also cause the vital organs to be compromised due to reduced perfusion.<ref name=Robbins/>  If the bowel becomes sufficiently [[ischemic]], bacteria may enter the blood stream, resulting in the increased complication of [[septic shock|endotoxic shock]].<ref name=Guyton/><ref name=Robbins/>

===Refractory===
At this stage, the vital organs have failed and the shock can no longer be reversed. [[Brain damage]] and cell death are occurring, and death will occur imminently.  One of the primary reasons that shock is irreversible at this point is that much cellular [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] has been degraded into [[adenosine]] in the absence of oxygen as an electron receptor in the mitochondrial matrix.  Adenosine easily perfuses out of cellular membranes into extracellular fluid, furthering capillary [[vasodilation]], and then is transformed into [[uric acid]].  Because cells can only produce adenosine at a rate of about 2% of the cell's total need per hour, even restoring oxygen is futile at this point because there is no adenosine to [[phosphorylate]] into ATP.<ref name=Guyton/>

===Septic shock===
*Systemic [[leukocyte]] adhesion to endothelial tissue<ref name=Robbins/>
*Reduced contractility of the heart<ref name=Robbins/>
*Activation of the coagulation pathways, resulting in [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]]<ref name=Robbins/>
*Increased levels of [[neutrophils]]<ref name=Robbins/>
Main manifestations are produced due to massive release of histamine which causes intense vasodilatation

==Diagnosis==
The first changes seen in shock is an increased [[cardiac output]] followed by a decrease in [[mixed venous oxygen saturation]] (SmvO2) as measured in the [[pulmonary artery]] via a [[pulmonary artery catheter]].<!-- <ref name=Tint10/> --> [[Central venous oxygen saturation]] (ScvO2) as measured via a central line correlates well with SmvO2 and are easier to acquire.<!-- <ref name=Tint10/> --> If shock progresses [[anaerobic metabolism]] will begin to occur with an increased blood [[lactic acid]] as the result.<!-- <ref name=Tint10/> --> While many laboratory tests are typically performed there is no test that either makes or excludes the diagnosis.<!-- <ref name=Tint10/> --> A [[chest X-ray]] or emergency department ultrasound may be useful to determine volume state.<ref name=Tint10/><ref name=Tint10,2/>

==Differential diagnosis==
Shock is a common end point of many medical conditions.<ref name=EMB05>{{cite journal|last=Silverman|first=Adam|title=Shock: A Common Pathway For Life-Threatening Pediatric Illnesses And Injuries|journal=Pediatric Emergency Medicine Practice|year=2005|month=Oct|volume=2|issue=10|url=http://www.ebmedicine.net/topics.php?paction=showTopic&topic_id=149}}</ref> It has been divided into four main types based on the underlying cause: hypovolemic, distributive, cardiogenic and obstructive.<ref>{{cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli))|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=168 |isbn=0-07-148480-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> A few additional classifications are occasionally used including: endocrinologic shock.<ref name=EMB05/>

===Hypovolemic===
This is the most common type of shock and is caused by insufficient circulating [[blood volume|volume]].<ref name=Tint10/>  Its primary cause is hemorrhage (internal and/or external), or loss of fluid from the [[Circulatory system|circulation]]. [[Vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]] are the most common cause in children.<ref name=EMB05/> With other causes including burns, environmental exposure and excess urine loss due to [[diabetic ketoacidosis]] and [[diabetes insipidus]].<ref name=EMB05/>

===Cardiogenic===
This type of shock is caused by the failure of the heart to pump effectively.<ref name=Tint10/> This can be due to damage to the heart muscle, most often from a large [[myocardial infarction]]. Other causes of cardiogenic shock include [[cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]]s, [[cardiomyopathy]]/[[myocarditis]], [[congestive heart failure]] (CHF), [[Myocardial contusion|contusio cordis]], or [[cardiac valve]] problems.<ref name=EMB05/>

===Obstructive===
Obstructive shock is due to obstruction of blood flow outside of the heart.<ref name=Tint10/> Several conditions can result in this form of shock.
*[[Cardiac tamponade]]<ref name=EMB05/> in which fluid in the pericardium prevents inflow of blood into the heart (venous return). [[Constrictive pericarditis]], in which the [[pericardium]] shrinks and hardens, is similar in presentation.
*[[Tension pneumothorax]]<ref name=EMB05/> Through increased intrathoracic pressure, bloodflow to the heart is prevented (venous return).
*[[Pulmonary embolism]] is the result of a thromboembolic incident in the blood vessels of the [[lung]]s and hinders the return of blood to the heart.
*[[Aortic stenosis]] hinders circulation by obstructing the [[ventricular outflow tract]]

===Distributive===
Distributive shock is due to impaired utilization of oxygen and thus production of energy by the cell.<ref name=Tint10/> Examples of this form of shock are:
*[[Septic shock]] is the most common cause of distributive shock.<ref name=EMB05/> Caused by an overwhelming systemic infection resulting in [[vasodilation]] leading to hypotension. Septic shock can be caused by [[Gram negative]] bacteria such as (among others) ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', Proteus species, ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' which release an [[endotoxin]] which produces adverse biochemical, immunological and occasionally neurological effects which are harmful to the body, and other [[Gram-positive]] cocci, such as [[pneumococci]] and [[streptococci]], and certain fungi as well as Gram-positive bacterial toxins. Septic shock also includes some elements of cardiogenic shock. In 1992, the ACCP/SCCM Consensus Conference Committee defined septic shock: ". . .sepsis-induced hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg or a reduction of 40 mm Hg from baseline) despite adequate fluid resuscitation along with the presence of perfusion abnormalities that may include, but are not limited to, lactic acidosis, oliguria, or an acute alteration in mental status. Patients who are receiving inotropic or vasopressor agents may have a normalized blood pressure at the time that perfusion abnormalities are identified."
*[[Anaphylactic shock]] Caused by a severe [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reaction]] to an [[allergen]], [[antigen]], [[drug]] or foreign protein causing the release of [[histamine]] which causes widespread vasodilation, leading to hypotension and increased capillary permeability.
*High spinal injuries may cause [[neurogenic shock]].<ref name=Trauma07/> The classic symptoms include [[bradycardia|a slow heartrate]] due to loss of cardiac [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic tone]] and warm skin due to dilation of the peripheral blood vessels.<ref name=Trauma07/> (This term can be confused with [[spinal shock]] which is a recoverable loss of function of the [[spinal cord]] after injury and does not refer to the haemodynamic instability per se.)

===Endocrine===
Based on [[endocrine]] disturbances such as:
*[[Hypothyroidism]] (Can be considered a form of [[Cardiogenic shock]]) in critically ill patients, reduces [[cardiac output]] and can lead to [[hypotension]] and respiratory insufficiency.
*[[Hyperthyroidism|Thyrotoxicosis]] ([[Cardiogenic shock]])
**may induce a reversible cardiomyopathy.
*Acute [[adrenal insufficiency]] ([[Distributive shock]]) is frequently the result of discontinuing [[corticosteroid]] treatment without tapering the dosage. However, surgery and intercurrent disease in patients on corticosteroid therapy without adjusting the dosage to accommodate for increased requirements may also result in this condition.
*Relative adrenal insufficiency ([[Distributive shock]]) in critically ill patients where present [[cortisol|hormone levels]] are insufficient to meet the higher demands

==Management==
The best evidence exists for the treatment of [[septic shock]] in adults and as the pathophysiology appears similar in children and other types of shock treatment this has been extrapolated to these areas.<ref name=EMB05/> Management may include securing the airway via [[intubation]] to decrease the work of breathing, oxygen supplementation, intravenous fluids and a [[passive leg raise]] (not [[Trendelenburg position]]), and blood transfusions.<ref name=Tint10/> It is important to keep the person warm as well as adequately manage pain and anxiety as these can increase oxygen consumption.<ref name=Tint10/>

===Fluids===
Aggressive intravenous fluids are recommended in most types of shock (e.g. 1-2 liter [[normal saline]] bolus over 10 minutes or 20ml/kg in a child) which is usually instituted as the person is being further evaluated.<ref>{{cite book |author=American College of Surgeons |title=Atls, Advanced Trauma Life Support Program for Doctors |publisher=Amer College of Surgeons |location= |year=2008 |pages=58 |isbn=1-880696-31-6{{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (6) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |oclc= |doi= }}</ref> Which intravenous fluid is superior, [[colloids]] or [[Crystalloid fluid|crystalloids]], remains undetermined.<ref name=Tint10/> Thus as crystalloids are less expensive they are recommended.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Perel|first=P|coauthors=Roberts, I|title=Colloids versus crystalloids for fluid resuscitation in critically ill patients|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2007 Oct 17|issue=4|pages=CD000567|pmid=17943746|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000567.pub3|editor1-last=Perel|editor1-first=Pablo}}</ref> If the person remains in shock after initial resuscitation [[packed red blood cells]] should be administered to keep the [[hemoglobin]] greater than 100&nbsp;gms/l.<ref name=Tint10/>

For those with hemorrhagic shock the current evidence supports limiting the use of fluids for penetrating thorax and abdominal injuries allowing mild [[hypotension]] to persist (known as [[permissive hypotension]]).<ref name=Rosen2010>{{cite book|title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition|last=Marx|first=J|year=2010|publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-0-323-05472-0|page=2467}}</ref> Targets include a [[mean arterial pressure]] of 60&nbsp;mmHg, a [[systolic blood pressure]] of 70-90&nbsp;mmHg,<ref name=Tint10>{{cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli))|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York|year=2010 |pages=176 |isbn=0-07-148480-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name=EMB11/> or until their adequate mentation and peripheral pulses.<ref name=EMB11>{{cite journal|last=Cherkas|first=David|title=Traumatic Hemorrhagic Shock: Advances In Fluid Management|journal=Emergency Medicine Practice|year=2011|month=Nov|volume=13|issue=11|url=http://www.ebmedicine.net/store.php?paction=showProduct&catid=8&pid=244}}</ref>

===Medications===
[[Vasopressors]] may be used if blood pressure does not improve with fluids. There is no evidence of superiority of one vasopressor over another.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Havel|first=C|coauthors=Arrich, J, Losert, H, Gamper, G, Müllner, M, Herkner, H|title=Vasopressors for hypotensive shock|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2011-05-11|volume=5|pages=CD003709|pmid=21563137|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003709.pub3|editor1-last=Herkner|editor1-first=Harald|issue=5}}</ref> Vasopressors have not been found to improve outcomes when used for [[hemorrhagic shock]] from [[Trauma (medical)|trauma]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Diez|first=C|coauthors=Varon, AJ|title=Airway management and initial resuscitation of the trauma patient|journal=Current opinion in critical care|date=2009 Dec|volume=15|issue=6|pages=542–7|pmid=19713836|doi=10.1097/MCC.0b013e328331a8a7}}</ref> but may be of use in [[neurogenic shock]].<ref name=Trauma07>{{cite journal|last=Cocchi|first=MN|coauthors=Kimlin, E, Walsh, M, Donnino, MW|title=Identification and resuscitation of the trauma patient in shock|journal=Emergency medicine clinics of North America|date=2007 Aug|volume=25|issue=3|pages=623–42, vii|pmid=17826209|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2007.06.001}}</ref> [[Activated protein C]] (Xigris) while once aggressively promoted for the management of [[septic shock]] has been found to improve survival and is associated with a number of complications, thus recommended.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Martí-Carvajal|first=AJ|coauthors=Solà, I, Lathyris, D, Cardona, AF|title=Human recombinant activated protein C for severe sepsis|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2011 Apr 13|issue=4|pages=CD004388|pmid=21491390|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004388.pub4|editor1-last=Martí-Carvajal|editor1-first=Arturo J}}</ref> The use of [[sodium bicarbonate]] is controversial as it has not been shown to improve outcomes.<ref name=bicarb08>{{cite journal|last=Boyd|first=JH|coauthors=Walley, KR|title=Is there a role for sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic acidosis from shock?|journal=Current opinion in critical care|date=2008 Aug|volume=14|issue=4|pages=379–83|pmid=18614899|doi=10.1097/MCC.0b013e3283069d5c}}</ref> If used at all it should only be considered if the pH is less than 7.0.<ref name=bicarb08/>

===Treatment goals===
The goal of treatment is to achieve a urine output of greater than 0.5&nbsp;cc/kg/hr, a [[central venous pressure]] of 8-12&nbsp;mmHg and a [[mean arterial pressure]] of 65-95&nbsp;mmHg. In trauma the goal is to stop the bleeding which in many cases requires surgical interventions.

==Epidemiology==
Hemorrhagic shock occurs in about 1-2% of trauma cases.<ref name=EMB11/>

==Prognosis==
The prognosis of shock depends on the underlying cause and the nature and extent of concurrent problems. Hypovolemic, anaphylactic and neurogenic shock are readily treatable and respond well to medical therapy. Septic shock however, is a grave condition with a mortality rate between 30% and 50%. The prognosis of cardiogenic shock is even worse.<ref name="IrwinRippe">{{cite book |last= Irwin|first= Richard S. |coauthors= Rippe, James M. |title= Intensive Care Medicine  |url= http://www.lww.com/product/?0-7817-3548-3 |publisher= Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia & London |year= 2003 |month= January |isbn= 0-7817-3548-3}}</ref>

==History==
In 1972 Hinshaw and Cox suggested the classification system for shock which is still used today.<ref name="IrwinRippe"/>
