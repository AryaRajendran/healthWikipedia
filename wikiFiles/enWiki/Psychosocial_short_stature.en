The symptoms include decreased [[growth hormone]] (GH) and [[somatomedin]] secretion, very short stature, weight that is inappropriate for the height, and immature [[skeletal age]]. This disease is a progressive one, and as long as the child is left in the stressing environment, his or her cognitive abilities continue to degenerate. Though rare in the population at large, it is common in [[feral children]] and in children kept in abusive, confined conditions for extended lengths of time. It can cause the body to completely stop growing but is generally considered to be temporary; regular growth will resume when the source of stress is removed.

==Etiology==
Children with PSS have extremely low levels of [[growth hormone]].  These children possibly have a problem with [[somatostatin|growth hormone inhibiting hormone]] (GHIH) or [[growth hormone releasing hormone]] (GHRH). The children could either be unresponsive to these hormones or too sensitive.

Children who have PSS exhibit signs of [[failure to thrive]]. Even though they appear to be receiving adequate [[nutrition]], they do not grow and develop normally compared to other children of their age.

An environment of constant and extreme stress causes PSS. Stress releases hormones in the body such as [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]], engaging what is known as the 'fight or flight' response. The heart speeds up and the body diverts resources away from processes that are not immediately important; in PSS, the production of growth hormone (GH) is thus affected.  As well as lacking growth hormone, children with PSS exhibit [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] problems due to the large amounts of epinephrine and norepinephrine, resulting in their bodies lacking proper digestion of nutrients and further affecting development.

While the cure for PSS is questionable, some studies show that placing the child affected with the disease in a foster or group home increases growth rate and socialization skills.

==Cases==

One case was a child who was admitted to a hospital with an extremely low weight. One nurse took over his care and he began to rapidly gain weight and his growth hormone levels increased during this time. The child was so dependent on the nurse emotionally that when she left, his levels returned to what they had been when he was admitted to the hospital, and once she returned, they stabilized once more.<ref name=sapolsky>{{cite book

When a police raid in 1987 released the children held by an Australian cult known as [[Santiniketan Park Association|The Family]], one twelve-year-old girl weighed under 20&nbsp;kg (44&nbsp;lbs) and was under 120&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;ft) tall. She grew 11&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;in) in the following year and her growth hormone levels returned to normal.<ref>{{cite journal

 |quote= My name is Sarah Hamilton-Byrne. I grew up in a cult called 'The Family'... Cassandra, my
youngest sister, was 12 years old but under 120 cm and weighed under 20 kg. She looked like a four- or five-year-old.

Writer [[J. M. Barrie]] has been speculated to have experienced PSS.  His brother died when Barrie was six years old, and their mother – mourning the loss of her favorite child – neglected him for a time afterward.  He was famously shorter than average (5&nbsp;ft 3½&nbsp;in. according to his 1934 passport), and his marriage was reportedly never consummated, prompting speculation that he was in some ways physically immature.<ref name=sapolsky/> He is most famous for his story of [[Peter Pan]], the boy who never grew up.

==Fictional characters==
In [[Günter Grass]]'s 1959 novel ''[[The Tin Drum]]'' (''Die Blechtrommel''), the character Oskar Matzerath  "willfully stunted his growth at three feet tall as a three-year-old, although later in the novel he grows to four feet one inch" <ref>Grass's own [http://www.bookrags.com/notes/ttd/CHR.html description]</ref> in reaction to the stress he experiences&nbsp;– the petit-bourgeois German society, the rise of Nazism, etc.
