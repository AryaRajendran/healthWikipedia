'''''Cyclospora cayetanensis''''' is a [[protozoa]]n that causes [[disease]] in humans, and perhaps other primates. It has been linked in the [[United States]] from [[faeces|fecally]]-contaminated imported [[raspberry|raspberries]] and was virtually unknown before about 1990, but has been on the rise since. The health risk associated with the disease is usually confined to adult foreigners visiting endemic regions and acquiring the infection: this is why ''C. cayetanensis'' has been labeled as causing "traveler's [[diarrhea]]."

This species was placed in the Cyclospora genus because of the spherical shape of its sporocysts. The species name refers to the [[Cayetano Heredia University]] in Lima, Peru, where early epidemiological and taxonomic work was done.<ref name="urlCyclospora cayetanensis">{{cite web|url=http://www.k-state.edu/parasitology/cyclospora/cyclospora.html|title=Cyclospora cayetanensis|accessdate=2009-01-21}}</ref>

==Characterization==
''Cyclospora cayetanensis'' is an [[apicomplexa]]n, cyst-forming [[coccidia]]n [[protozoa]]n that causes a self-limiting diarrhea. Morphologically speaking, ''C. cayetanensis'' has spherical [[oocyst]]s that are between 7.5 and 10 [[micrometre|micrometers]] in diameter that also have a 50 [[nanometer]] thick wall with an outer threadlike coat that has been called a wrinkle by some researchers. 

The only hosts ''C. cayentanensis'' uses are humans. The protozoan lives out its lifecycle intracellularly within the host’s [[epithelial cell]]s and [[gastrointestinal tract]]. Infection is transmitted through the oral-fecal route, and begins when a person ingests oocysts in fecally contaminated food or water. Various chemicals in the host's gastrointestinal tract cause the oocysts to excyst and release [[sporozoite]]s; generally, two are observed per oocyst. After these sporozoites invade the epithelial cells, they undergo [[Protozoal merogony|merogony]], a form of [[asexual reproduction]] that results in many daughter merozoites. These daughter cells may either infect new host cells and initiate yet another round of [[Protozoal merogony|merogony]], or they can take on a sexual track via [[Gametogonium|gametogony]]: daughter merozoites become male macrogamonts — which form many microgametes — and female macrogamonts. After fertilization has occurred via male microgamete fusion with female macrogamont, the [[zygote]] matures into an oocyst and ruptures the host cell, from which point it is passed with the [[faeces|stool]]. The oocysts that are passed are not, however, immediately infectious. Sporulation can take anywhere from one to several weeks, meaning that person-to-person transmission is not a likely problem. This differentiates ''C. cayentanensis'' from ''Cryptosporidium parvum'' — a closely related organism that causes a similar disease — since ''C. parvum'' oocysts are immediately infectious upon release from the host.

==Symptoms==
''C. cayentanensis'' causes [[gastroenteritis]], with the extent of the illness varying based on age, condition of the host, and size of the infectious dose. Symptoms include "watery diarrhea, loss of appetite, weight loss, abdominal bloating and cramping, increased [[flatulence]], [[nausea]], fatigue, and low-grade [[fever]]," though this can be augmented in more severe cases by vomiting, substantial weight loss, explosive diarrhea, and muscle aches. Typically, patients who come in with a persistent watery diarrhea lasting over several days may be suspected of harboring the disease, especially if they have traveled to a region where the protozoan is endemic. The [[incubation period]] in the host is typically around a week, and illness can last six weeks before self-limiting. Unless treated, illness may relapse. It is important to note here that the more severe forms of the disease can occur in [[Immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] patients such as those with [[AIDS]].

==Recognition==
Due to its small size, intracellular habitat, and inability to properly uptake many histological stains, diagnosis of ''Cyclospora cayetanensis'' can be very difficult. Four methods have thus far been established for positive diagnosis of the protozoan: microscopic detection in stool samples of oocysts; recovering oocysts in intestinal fluid/small bowel biopsy specimens; demonstration of oocyst sporulation; and amplification by [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) of ''C. cayetanensis'' [[DNA]]. Since detection is so hard, one negative result should not discount the possibility of ''C. cayetanensis'': tests involving fresh stool samples over the next few days should also be considered.

Except for PCR amplification, once a sample with suspected oocysts has been recovered, standard tests are followed to identify ''C. cayetanensis''. These tests include [[Microscopy#Phase Contrast Optical Microscopy|phase contrast microscopy]] to check for the spherical oocysts described earlier, modified acid-fast staining to check for variable staining (all the way from pale to red), and [[autofluorescence]] with [[ultra violet|UV]] lights. Obtaining these oocysts is usually the challenge, though recent studies show easier methods of obtaining them. In a recent study on different techniques used in fecal exams to identify oocysts, it was demonstrated that centrifuging a sample of feces in a sucrose solution and then transferring a small amount to a slide was remarkably effective — both in oocysts found and relative ease of labor — in detecting ''C. cayetanensis'' oocysts: indeed, the paper concluded that the total number of positive samples obtained was around 84%.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

''C. cayetanensis'' has been confused with other protozoan infections in the past, most commonly being misidentified as ''Cryptosporidium parvum''. There are several differences that can be noted between the two, however, to ensure proper diagnosis. These differences include: size difference — ''C. parvum'' is smaller; differing results from modified acid-fast staining — ''C. parvum'' has consistent red staining, whereas ''C. cayetanensis'' shows variable staining; and autofluorescence under UV light — ''C. cayetanensis'' exhibits this, whereas ''C. parvum'' does not.

==Treatment==
Though the diarrhea caused by ''C. cayetanensis'' is self-limiting, relapses can and do occur. To date, the most effective drug for the treatment of the protozoan is a seven-day course of oral [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]] (TMP-SMX). Effects of the drug include a significant decrease in the duration of oocyst excretion, cessation of diarrhea, and stool samples negative for oocysts within two to three days. Relapses respond promptly to therapy, and there has been talk of using TMP-SMX as a [[prophylaxis]] for HIV/AIDS patients and immunocompromised patients (ex: organ transplant recipients<ref>http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra064928</ref>).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Prevention==
Since infection occurs via fecally contaminated food and water in endemic environments, there are several simple solutions to suggest for the prevention of C. cayetanensis infections. The simplest one is to warn travelers not to visit regions where the protozoan is endemic (generally tropical and sub-tropical regions where [[sanitation]] is poor such as [[Peru]], [[Brazil]], and [[Haiti]]), especially when the disease is in its best season for spreading: such was the reason behind the first reported case of [[cyclosporiasis]] in [[Korea]]. This is not to say that natives of a region are completely free from possible infection: a middle-aged [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[lawyer]] living in an urban area with water sanitized by the local government and with no travel history recently became Turkey’s first [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/autochthon autochthonous] case. This woman most likely received the infection from consuming some infected foodstuffs (possibly raspberries) that were not thoroughly washed before consumption. Thus, better health practices in the originating agricultural setting — such as ensuring produce is fully washed and kept away from human feces — and in the individual's environment—taking an extra few seconds to wash that produce as well — would lead to a lower incidence of infection.
