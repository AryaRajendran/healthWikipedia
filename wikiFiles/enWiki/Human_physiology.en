'''Human physiology''' is the science of the mechanical, [[Human body|physical]], [[Bioelectromagnetism|bioelectrical]], and [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] functions of humans in good [[health]], their [[organs]], and the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of which they are composed. [[Physiology]] focuses principally at the level of organs and systems. Most aspects of human physiology are closely [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to corresponding aspects of [[animal]] physiology, and [[animal experimentation]] has provided much of the foundation of physiological knowledge.  [[Human anatomy|Anatomy]] and physiology are closely related fields of study: anatomy, the study of form, and physiology, the study of function, are intrinsically related and are studied in tandem as part of a [[medicine|medical]] curriculum.

== The concept of homeostasis ==
The term "[[homeostasis]]" refers to the maintenance of overall inner resistance in the body. Homeostasis stabilizes the body by regulating the internal environment. This is required for the body to function sufficiently. The Homeostatic process is essential for the survival of each cell, tissue, and body system. Homeostasis in a general sense refers to stability, balance or equilibrium. Maintaining a stable internal environment requires constant monitoring, mostly by the brain and nervous system. The brain receives information from the body and responds appropriately through the release of various substances like [[neurotransmitters]], [[catecholamines]], and [[hormones]]. Individual organ physiology furthermore facilitates the maintenance of homeostasis of the whole body e.g. Blood pressure regulation: the release of renin by the kidneys allow blood pressure to be stabilized (Renin, Angiotensinogen, Aldosterone System), though the brain helps regulate blood pressure  by the Pituitary releasing Anti-Diuretic Hormone (ADH). Thus, homeostasis is maintained within the body as a whole, dependent upon its parts.

==Systems==
Traditionally, the academic discipline of physiology views the body as a collection of interacting systems, each with its own combination of functions and purposes. Each body system contributes to the homeostasis of other systems and of the entire organism. No system of the body works in isolation, and the well-being of the person depends upon the well-being of all the interacting body systems.

 | [[File:Human brain NIH.jpg|50px]] || The '''[[nervous system]]''' consists of the [[central nervous system]] (which is the [[human brain|brain]] and [[spinal cord]]) and [[peripheral nervous system]]. The brain is the organ of thought, emotion, memory, and sensory processing, and serves many aspects of communication and control of various other systems and functions. The '''[[special senses]]''' consist of [[Visual perception|vision]], [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[taste]], and [[olfaction|smell]]. The [[human eye|eye]]s, [[ear]]s, [[tongue]], and [[human nose|nose]] gather information about the body's environment.   || [[neuroscience]], [[neurology]] (disease), [[psychiatry]] (behavioral), [[ophthalmology]] (vision), [[otolaryngology]] (hearing, taste, smell) || [[neurophysiology]]

It gives the body basic structure and the ability for movement. In addition to their structural role, the larger bones in the body contain [[bone marrow]], the site of production of blood cells.

 | [[File:Diagram of the human heart (cropped).svg|50px]] || The '''[[circulatory system]]''' consists of the [[heart]] and blood vessels ([[artery|arteries]], [[vein]]s, [[capillary|capillaries]]). The heart propels the circulation of the [[blood]], which serves as a "transportation system" to transfer [[oxygen]], fuel, nutrients, waste products, immune cells, and signalling molecules (i.e., [[hormones]]) from one part of the body to another. The '''[[blood]]''' consists of fluid that carries [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s in the circulation, including some that move from tissue to blood vessels and back, as well as the [[spleen]] and [[bone marrow]].  || [[cardiology]] (heart), [[hematology]] (blood) || [[cardiovascular physiology]]

 | [[File:Male anatomy.png|50px]] || The '''[[reproductive system]]''' consists of the [[gonad]]s and the internal and external [[sex organ]]s.

The immune system provides a mechanism for the body to distinguish its own cells and tissues from alien cells and substances and to neutralize or destroy the latter by using specialized proteins such as [[antibodies]], [[cytokines]], and [[toll-like receptors]], among many others. ||  [[immunology]]  || immunology

 | [[File:Illu endocrine system.png|50px]] || The '''[[endocrine system]]''' consists of the principal endocrine glands: the [[pituitary]], [[thyroid]], [[adrenal]]s, [[pancreas]], [[parathyroid]]s, and [[gonad]]s, but nearly all organs and tissues produce specific endocrine [[hormone]]s as well. The endocrine hormones serve as signals from one body system to another regarding an enormous array of conditions, and resulting in variety of changes of function.  There is also the [[Exocrine gland|exocrine system]]. || [[endocrinology]] || endocrinology

The traditional divisions by system are somewhat arbitrary. Many body parts participate in more than one system, and systems might be organized by function, by embryological origin, or other categorizations. In particular, is the "'''[[neuroendocrinology|neuroendocrine system]]'''", the complex interactions of the neurological and endocrinological systems which together regulate physiology. Furthermore, many aspects of physiology are not as easily included in the traditional organ system categories.

The study of how physiology is altered in disease is [[pathophysiology]].

During the [[Middle Ages]], the ancient Greek and Indian medical traditions were further developed by [[Islamic medicine|Muslim physicians]]. Notable work in this period was done by [[Avicenna]] (980-1037), author of the ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'', and [[Ibn al-Nafis]] (1213â€“1288), among others.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
[[File:Vesalius Fabrica portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Vesalius]] from his ''De humani corporis fabrica'' (1543).]]
Following from the Middle Ages, the [[Renaissance]] brought an increase of physiological research in the [[Western world]] that triggered the modern study of anatomy and physiology. [[Andreas Vesalius]] was an author of one of the most influential books on [[human anatomy]], ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]''.<ref>{{cite web

[[Herman Boerhaave]] is sometimes referred to as a father of physiology due to his exemplary teaching in Leiden and textbook ''Institutiones medicae'' (1708).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In the 18th century, important works in this field were by [[Pierre Cabanis]], a French doctor and physiologist.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

In the 19th century, physiological knowledge began to accumulate at a rapid rate, in particular with the 1838 appearance of the [[Cell theory]] of [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Matthias Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]]. It radically stated that organisms are made up of units called cells. [[Claude Bernard]]'s (1813â€“1878) further discoveries ultimately led to his concept of ''[[milieu interieur]]'' (internal environment), which would later be taken up and championed as "[[homeostasis]]" by American physiologist [[Walter Cannon]] (1871â€“1945).{{Clarify|date=October 2009|"taken up and championed as 'homeostasis'" implies that homeostasis and internal environment are the same thing, which the absolutely are not. Homeostasis uses the concept of an internal environment.}}

In the 20th century, biologists also became interested in how organisms other than human beings function, eventually spawning the fields of [[comparative physiology]] and [[ecophysiology]].<ref>{{Cite book

The biological basis of the study of physiology, integration refers to the overlap of many functions of the systems of the human body, as well as its accompanied form. It is achieved through communication that occurs in a variety of ways, both electrical and chemical.

In terms of the human body, the endocrine and nervous systems play major roles in the reception and transmission of signals that integrate function. Homeostasis is a major aspect with regard to the interactions within an organism, humans included.
