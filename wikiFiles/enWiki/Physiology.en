==History==
The study of human physiology dates back to at least 420&nbsp; BC and the time of [[Hippocrates]],also known as the father of medicine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceclarified.com/Ph-Py/Physiology.html |title=Physiology|work=Science Clarified |publisher= Advameg, Inc. |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> The critical thinking of [[Aristotle]] and his emphasis on the relationship between structure and function marked the beginning of physiology in [[Ancient Greece]], while Claudius Galenus (c. 126–199&nbsp;AD), known as [[Galen]], was the first to use experiments to probe the function of the body. Galen was the founder of experimental physiology.<ref>{{Cite journal | first1 = C. | last1 = Fell | first2 = F. | last2 = Griffith Pearson | title = Historical Perspectives of Thoracic Anatomy | journal = Thoracic Surgery Clinics | year = 2007 | month = November | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 443–8| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1547412706001034 | doi = 10.1016/j.thorsurg.2006.12.001}}</ref>

[[Jean Fernel]], a French physician, introduced the term "physiology" in 1525.

In the 19th century, physiological knowledge began to accumulate at a rapid rate, in particular with the 1838 appearance of the [[Cell theory]] of [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Matthias Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]]. It radically stated that organisms are made up of units called cells. [[Claude Bernard]]'s (1813–1878) further discoveries ultimately led to his concept of ''[[milieu interieur]]'' (internal environment), which would later be taken up and championed as "[[homeostasis]]" by American physiologist [[Walter Cannon]] (1871–1945).{{Clarify|date=October 2009|"taken up and championed as 'homeostasis'" implies that homeostasis and internal environment are the same thing, which they absolutely are not. Homeostasis uses the concept of an internal environment.}}

In the 20th century, biologists also became interested in how organisms other than human beings function, eventually spawning the fields of [[comparative physiology]] and [[ecophysiology]].<ref>{{Cite book | last1=Feder | first1=ME |last2=Bennett |first2=AF |first3=Burggren |last3=WW |last4=Huey |first4=RB  | title = New directions in ecological physiology | year = 1987 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-521-34938-3}}</ref> Major figures in these fields include [[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen]] and [[George Bartholomew (biologist)|George Bartholomew]]. Most recently, [[evolutionary physiology]] has become a distinct subdiscipline.<ref>{{Cite journal | first1 = Theodore | last1 = Garland, Jr | author1-link=Theodore Garland, Jr. | last2 = Carter | first2 = P.

The biological basis of the study of physiology, integration refers to the overlap of many functions of the systems of the human body, as well as its accompanied form. It is achieved through communication that occurs in a variety of ways, both electrical and chemical.

The endocrine and nervous systems play major roles in the reception and transmission of signals that integrate function in animals.  Homeostasis is a major aspect with regard to such interactions within plants as well as animals.

==Human physiology==
{{Main|Human physiology}}
Human physiology is the science of the mechanical, physical, and biochemical functions of humans, their organs, and the cells of which they are composed. The principal level of focus of physiology is at the level of organs and systems within systems. Much of the foundation of knowledge in human physiology was provided by animal experimentation. Physiology is closely related to [[anatomy]]; anatomy is the study of form, and physiology is the study of function. Due to the frequent connection between form and function, physiology and anatomy are intrinsically linked and are studied in tandem as part of a medical curriculum.
