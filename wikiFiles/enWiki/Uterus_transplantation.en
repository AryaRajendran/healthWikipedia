The '''uterine transplant''' is the surgical procedure whereby a healthy uterus is [[Organ transplants|transplanted]] into an organism whose [[uterus]] is absent or diseased. As part of the normal [[Sexual reproduction|mammalian sexual reproduction]] process, a diseased or absent uterus does not allow for normal embryonic [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] to occur, effectively rendering a female infertile. This phenomenon is known as [[Female infertility|uterine factor infertility (UFI)]]. The uterine transplant is currently being proposed as a potential treatment to this form of infertility. The world's first successful uterine transplant was conducted by a team of doctors from Akdeniz University Hospital in southern Turkey on the 9th of August 2011.{{synthesis-inline|date=November 2012}}<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2050401/Married-nurse-hopes-worlds-baby-womb-transplant-donated-MOTHER.html | location=London | newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]] | title=Nurse hopes to have world's first baby from a transplant womb donated by her own MOTHER}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20111010/health-fitness/turkish-woman-has-world-s-first-womb-transplant.388596 |title=Turkish woman has world's first womb transplant |publisher=timesofmalta.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/9926041-revolutionary-womb-transplant-performed-in-turkey-worlds-first |title=Revolutionary ‘Womb Transplant’ performed in Turkey - World’s First |publisher=Allvoices.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/first-uterus-surgery-success-845/ |title=World’s first successful uterus transplant performed in Turkey — RT |publisher=Rt.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=<!--[if IE 6]> <![endif]--> |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/10/01/169542.html |title=World’s first womb transplant in Turkey promises hope for women |publisher=Alarabiya.net |date=2011-10-01 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/doctors-hopeful-for-uterus-transplant.aspx?pageID=238&nID=12614&NewsCatID=373 |title=HEALTH - Doctors hopeful for uterus transplant |publisher=Hurriyetdailynews.com |date=2011-09-13 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trt-world.com/trtworld/en/newsDetail.aspx?HaberKodu=0222eb41-3a81-41b9-9123-2a256f5f2b31 |title=World's first uterus transplant performed in Turkey/TRT-English |publisher=Trt-world.com |date=2012-02-27 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/?aType=haber&ArticleID=77268 |title=Turkish surgeons perform world's first uterus transplant &#124; Family & Health |publisher=World Bulletin |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref>

In 1896, Knauer published the first study of ovarian [[autotransplantation]] documenting normal function (in a rabbit) and that led to the investigation of uterine transplantation in 1918.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Knauer |first=Emil |year=1896 |title=Einige Versuche über Ovarientransplantation bei Kaninchen |trans_title=An attempt at ovary transplantation in rabbits |language=German |journal=Zentralblatt für Gynäkologie |volume=20 |pages=524–8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/humupd/3.3.267 |title=Transplantation in reproductive medicine: Previous experience, present knowledge and future prospects |year=1997 |last1=Nugent |first1=D |journal=Human Reproduction Update |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=267–80 |pmid=9322102 |last2=Meirow |first2=D |last3=Brook |first3=PF |last4=Aubard |first4=Y |last5=Gosden |first5=RG}}</ref>  <!-- originally read: "In 1896 Knauer published the first study of ovarian transplantation and Grigor’ve that lead to the investigation of uterine autotransplantation in 1918." removed "Grigor've" but the correct name should be added back in with the proper citation.

==Turkey==

A 21-years-old [[Turkey|Turkish]] woman named Derya Sert, who was born without a uterus, was the first woman in history to have received a womb from a deceased donor. The operation, performed on August 9, 2011 by Dr. [[Ömer Özkan]], Dr. [[Munire Erman Akar]] and their team at [[Akdeniz University]] Hospital in [[Antalya]], Turkish Riviera was and still is the world's first successful uterus transplant surgery. Ms. Sert has had 6 menstrual periods post-surgery and it is said that the uterus is fully functioning. However, the Turkish medical team who performed the delicate surgery is still cautious about declaring the operation a complete success. "The surgery was a success. But we will be successful when she has her baby", Ozkan said. "For now, we are happy that the tissue is living".<ref>{{cite web | date=Oct 2011 | title=World's first successful uterus transplant performed in Turkey | url=http://rt.com/news/first-uterus-surgery-success-845/|publisher=Rt.com|accessdate=2012-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | date= 18-Oct-2011 | newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]]| title=Nurse hopes to have world's first baby from a transplant womb donated by her own mother | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2050401/Married-nurse-hopes-worlds-baby-womb-transplant-donated-MOTHER.html}}</ref>

On the 12th of April 2013, [[Akdeniz University]] announced that Derya Sert the first female to have successfully received a uterus transplant was pregnant<ref>http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/womb-transplant-recipient-derya-sert-pregnant/story-fn5fsgyc-1226619553524</ref><ref>http://shine.yahoo.com/healthy-living/womb-transplant-patient-derya-sert-is-pregnant--confirms-doctor-210119461.html</ref><ref>http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/worlds-first-uterus-transplant-patient-pregnant-say-doctors.aspx?pageID=238&nID=44790&NewsCatID=373</ref>. The statement made by the University Hospital also added that Mrs. Sert would give birth by C-Section to prevent any complications.

==Procedure==
Uterus transplantation starts with uterus retrieval surgery on the donor. Working techniques for this exist for animals, including primates.<ref name=brannstrom>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmp049 |title=Experimental uterus transplantation |year=2009 |last1=Brannstrom |first1=M. |last2=Wranning |first2=C. A. |last3=Altchek |first3=A. |journal=Human Reproduction Update |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=329–45 |pmid=19897849}}</ref> It may need to be stored for e.g. transportation to the location of the donor. Studies on cold-ischemia/reperfusion indicate an ischemic tolerance of >24 h.<ref name=brannstrom/> The following insertion procedure, with vascular anastomosis, has not been fully developed in animal models, indicated by frequent thrombosis formation.<ref name=brannstrom/>

==The Montreal Criteria for the Ethical Feasibility of Uterine Transplantation==
In their paper entitled "''The Montreal Criteria for the Ethical Feasibility of Uterine Transplantation''" published in ''Transplant International'',<ref name="Doi" /> Ariel Lefkowitz, Marcel Edwards, and Jacques Balayla from [[McGill University]] developed a set of criteria deemed to be required for the ethical execution of the uterine transplant in humans. These findings were presented at the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics' 20th World Congress in Rome in October 2012.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Application on transgender women==
It may be possible for [[trans women]] to receive uteruses in the future. Some concerns regarding [[Sex-determination system|genetics]], [[Sexual dimorphism|anatomy]] and [[Endocrine system|hormones]] addressed below:
# Women with [[Swyer syndrome]] have male genetics and lack ovaries, but have a uterus. Similarly to trans women, they need [[Hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormone replacement therapy]] to induce female puberty and maintain female [[secondary sex characteristics]]. Such women have had successful pregnancies, though obviously requiring [[egg donation]] and [[IVF]].
# In the case of most trans women who began [[Hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|HRT]] past male puberty, the pelvis has failed to develop femininely and broaden as it would have before or during puberty. However, as proven by [[Nadya Suleman]] (octuplets), [[Lina Medina]] (youngest mother) and [[Stacey Herald]] (smallest mother at 71&nbsp;cm <ref>{{cite journal | title=World's smallest mother shows off baby number three |newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]] | date=2010-07-26| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1292367/Worlds-smallest-mother-Stacey-Herald-shows-baby-number-three.html}}</ref>), a small pelvis is not an obstacle to gestation, even in extreme cases. Delivery would be via [[c-section]].
