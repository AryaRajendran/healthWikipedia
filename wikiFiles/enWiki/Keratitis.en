'''Keratitis''' is a condition in which the [[human eye|eye]]'s [[cornea]], the front part of the eye, becomes [[inflammation|inflamed]]. The condition is often marked by moderate to intense pain and usually involves impaired eyesight. May cause feelings of scratching each time individual blinks eye<ref>[http://www.uic.edu/com/eye/PatientCare/EyeConditions/Keratitis.shtml Keratitis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Types==
Superficial keratitis involves the superficial layers (i.e. the epithelium) of the cornea. After healing, this form of keratitis does not generally leave a [[scar]].

Deep keratitis involves deeper layers of the cornea (i.e. The epithelium, Bowman's Membrane and often stroma), and the natural course leaves a [[scar]] upon healing that impairs [[Visual perception|vision]] if on or near the visual axis. This can be reduced or avoided with the use of topical [[corticosteroid]] eyedrops.

==Causes==
Keratitis has multiple causes, one of which is an infection of a present or previous [[herpes simplex virus]] secondary to an [[upper respiratory infection]], involving cold sores.

===Pathogens===
*[[Amoebic]] keratitis. Amoebic infection of the cornea is the most serious corneal infection, usually affecting [[contact lens]] wearers.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1099/jmm.0.2008/003459-0}}</ref> It is usually caused by [[Acanthamoeba]]. On May 25, 2007, the CDC issued a health advisory due to increased risk of [[Acanthamoeba keratitis]] (AK) associated with use of [[Advanced Medical Optics]] (AMO) Complete Moisture Plus Multi-Purpose eye solution.<ref>[http://www2a.cdc.gov/HAN/ArchiveSys/ViewMsgV.asp?AlertNum=00260 CDC Advisory]</ref>
*[[Bacterial]] keratitis. Bacterial infection of the cornea can follow from an injury or from wearing contact lenses. The bacteria  involved are ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' and for contact lens wearers, ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]. ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' contains enzymes that can digest the cornea.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Invest Ophthalmol Vis  Sci|year=2009|volume=50|issue=8|pages=3794&ndash;801|title=Properties of PASP: A Pseudomonas Protease Capable of Mediating Corneal Erosions|author=Tang A, Marquart ME, Fratkin JD, McCormick CC, Caballero AR, Gatlin HP, O'Callaghan RJ|pmid=19255155|doi=10.1167/iovs.08-3107|pmc=2874894}}</ref>
*[[Fungal keratitis]] (cf. [[Fusarium]], causing recent incidences of keratitis through the possible [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] of [[Bausch & Lomb]] [[ReNu]] with MoistureLoc [[contact lens]] solution)
*[[virus|Viral]] keratitis
:*[[Herpes of the eye|Herpes simplex keratitis]] ('''dendritic keratitis'''). Viral infection of the cornea is often caused by the [[herpes simplex virus]] which frequently leaves what is called a 'dendritic ulcer'.
:*[[Herpes zoster]] keratitis
*[[Onchocerciasis|Onchocercal]] keratitis, which follows [[Onchocerca volvulus|O. volvulus]] infection by infected [[Black_fly#Role_in_human_disease|blackfly bite]]. [[Simulium|These blackfly]] usually dwell near fast-flowing African streams, so the disease is also called "river blindness".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/onchocerciasis/factsht_onchocerciasis.htm#what |title= What is onchocerciasis? |publisher = CDC |accessdate= 2010-06-28 |quote= transmission is most intense in remote African rural agricultural villages, located near rapidly flowing streams...(WHO) expert committee on onchocerciasis estimates the global prevalence is 17.7 million, of whom about 270,000 are blind. }}</ref>

===Other===
*Exposure keratitis — due to dryness of the cornea caused by incomplete or inadequate eye-lid closure.
*[[Photokeratitis]] — keratitis due to intense [[ultraviolet radiation]] exposure (e.g. snow blindness or [[welder]]'s arc eye.)
*[[Corneal ulcer|Ulcerative keratitis]]
*Contact lens acute red eye (CLARE) — a non-ulcerative sterile keratitis associated with colonization of [[Gram-negative]] bacteria on contact lenses.
*Severe allergic response may lead to corneal inflammation and [[corneal ulcer|ulceration]] (i.e. [[vernal keratoconjunctivitis]]).<ref>[http://www.optometry.co.uk/files/0cd52f986c6c4d460c454802aa7cc5b3_schmid20010223.pdf Optometry.co.uk]</ref>
*Feline eosinophilic keratitis — affecting cats and horses; possibly initiated by [[feline herpesvirus 1]] or other viral infection.<ref>[http://www.vet.uga.edu/VPP/clerk/mackey/index.php VET.uga.edu]</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Effective diagnosis is important in detecting this condition and subsequent treatment as keratitis is sometimes mistaken for an allergic [[conjunctivitis]].

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the cause of the keratitis. Infectious keratitis can progress rapidly, and generally requires urgent antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral therapy to eliminate the pathogen.  Treatment is usually carried out by an ophthalmologist and can involve prescription eye medications, systemic medication, or even intravenous therapy.  It is inadvisable to use over-the-counter eye drops as they are typically not helpful in treating infections, also using them could delay correct treatment, increasing the likelihood of sight threatening complications. In addition, contact lens wearers are typically advised to discontinue contact lens wear and replace contaminated contact lenses and contact lens cases. (Contaminated lenses and cases should not be discarded as cultures from these can be used to identify the pathogen).

Antibacterial solutions include Quixinex ([[levofloxacin]]), Zymar ([[gatifloxacin]]), Vigamox ([[moxifloxacin]]), Ocuflox ([[ofloxacin]] &mdash; available generically). Steroid containing medications should not be used for bacterial infections, as they may exacerbate the disease and lead to severe corneal ulceration and corneal perforation{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}. These include Maxitrol ([[neomycin]]+[[polymyxin]]+[[dexamethasone]] &mdash; available generically), as well as other steroid medications. Aciclovir is the mainstay of treatment for HSV keratitis and steroids should be avoided at all costs in this condition. Application of steroids to a dendritic ulcer caused by HSV will result in rapid and significant worsening of the ulcer to form an 'amoeboid' or 'geographic' ulcer, so named because of the ulcer's map like shape{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}. One should consult an ophthalmologist or optometrist for treatment of an eye condition.

Some infections may scar the cornea to limit vision. Others may result in perforation of the cornea,  (an infection inside the eye), or even loss of the eye. With proper medical attention, infections can usually be successfully treated without long-term visual loss.
