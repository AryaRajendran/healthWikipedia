{{Health care reform in the United States}}
In the [[United States]], '''direct primary care''' (DPC) is [[primary care]] offered directly to the [[consumer]], without [[Health insurance in the United States|insurance]] administration. It is an [[umbrella term]], incorporating various [[health care]] delivery systems that involve direct financial relationships between patients and health care providers.

==Background==
Direct primary care is intended to remove many of the financial barriers of healthcare.{{POV-statement|date=May 2012}} Often, there are no [[Co-pay|insurance co-pay]]s, [[deductible]]s or [[co-insurance]] fees thus avoiding the overhead and complexity of maintaining relationships with insurers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health401k.com/2011/12/direct-primary-care/|title=Direct Primary Care|date=30 December 2011|publisher=Health 401k|accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref>

Under this model, patients may pay a combination of visit fees and/or fixed monthly fees which grant them access to a set of medical services, including same and next-day appointments, both in the form of house-calls and office visits.

Typically a direct primary care arrangement is paired with either:
* A [[high-deductible health plan]], as DPC alone will not cover catastrophic health care such as most surgeries
* A [[health savings account]], or health reimbursement account as the associated tax-benefits can generally be applied to DPC and other medical expenses.

One of the lesser known provisions of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] can be found on page 77. This provision allows for direct primary care to compete with traditional health insurance options in the mandated [[Health insurance exchange]] when combined with a low cost high deductible plan.

== Advantages ==
Direct primary care practices do not typically accept insurance payments, thus avoiding the overhead and complexity of maintaining relationships with insurers, which can take as much as $0.10  - $0.20 of each medical dollar spent.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pierre|first=Yong|title=The Healthcare Imperative: Lowering Costs and Improving Outcomes: Workshop Series Summary|year=2010|publisher=The National Academies Press|location=Washington DC|pages=141-174|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12750}}</ref> Consequently, because direct pay members are usually automatically billed a physicians practice's cash flow can also be improved. 

Because direct primary care payments are typically paid over time, rather than in return for specific services, the economic incentives are such that the long-term health of the patient is the most lucrative situation for the doctor.  As such, preventative care gains greater emphasis under DPC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2011/07/direct-primary-care-reduces-primary-care-costs.html|title=How direct primary care reduces primary care costs| last=Chase|first=Dave|publisher=KevinMD.com|accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref>

==Medicare pilot program==
The Direct M.D. Care Act of 2011, sponsored by Representative [[Bill Cassidy]] [R-LA], proposes a [[pilot program]] of direct primary care projects under [[Medicare (United States)#PartB|Medicare Part B]]. {{As of|2012|5}}, the bill has seven co-sponsors, five Democrats ([[Luis V. Gutierrez]], [D-IL], 
[[Mike Honda]] [D-CA],
<!-- [[Jay Inslee]], [D-WA], (quit to run for governor) -->
[[Jared Polis]] [D-CO], 
[[Allyson Schwartz]] [D-PA] 
[[Adam Smith (politician)|Adam Smith]], [D-WA]) and two Republicans ([[Dan Benishek]] [R-MI], [[Phil Gingrey]], [R-GA]).<ref>[[112th United States Congress|112th U.S. Congress]]: {{USBill|112|H.R.|3315|pipe=Direct M.D. Care Act of 2011 (H.R. 3315)}} from [[THOMAS]]</ref>{{primary source-inline|date=May 2012}}
