The '''FEV1/FVC ratio''', also called Tiffeneau-Pinelli<ref>Minelli R. Appunti dalle lezioni di fisiologia umana. La Goliardica Pavese, Pavia, 1992.</ref> index, is a calculated ratio used in the diagnosis of [[obstructive lung disease|obstructive]] and [[restrictive lung disease]].<ref name="pmid18786983">{{cite journal |author=Swanney MP, Ruppel G, Enright PL, ''et al'' |title=Using the lower limit of normal for the FEV1/FVC ratio reduces the misclassification of airway obstruction |journal=Thorax |volume=63 |issue=12 |pages=1046–51 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=18786983 |doi=10.1136/thx.2008.098483 |url=http://thorax.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18786983}}</ref><ref name="pmid8989055">{{cite journal |author=Sahebjami H, Gartside PS |title=Pulmonary function in obese subjects with a normal FEV1/FVC ratio |journal=Chest |volume=110 |issue=6 |pages=1425–9 |year=1996 |month=December |pmid=8989055 |doi= 10.1378/chest.110.6.1425|url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8989055}}</ref> It represents the proportion of a person's [[vital capacity]] that they are able to expire in the first second of expiration.<ref name="gp-training.net">http://www.gp-training.net/protocol/respiratory/copd/spirometry.htm</ref> See the Wikipedia article on [[spirometry]] for the definitions of FEV1 and FVC.

A derived value of FEV1% is '''FEV1% predicted''', which is defined as FEV1% of the patient divided by the average FEV1% in the population for any person of similar age, sex and body composition.

== Disease states ==
In obstructive lung disease, the FEV1 is reduced due to an obstruction of air escaping from the lungs. Thus, the FEV1/FVC ratio will be reduced.<ref name="gp-training.net"/>  More specifically, according to the [[National Institute for Clinical Excellence]], the diagnosis of COPD is made when the FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio is less than 70%, however, other authoritative bodies have different diagnostic cutoff points.<ref name=Nathell/> The [[Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease]] (GOLD) criteria also require that values are after [[bronchodilator]] medication has been given to make the diagnosis. According to the [[European Respiratory Society]] (ERS) criteria, it is ''FEV1% predicted'' that defines when a patient has COPD—that is, when the patient's FEV1% is less than 88% of the predicted value for men, or less than 89% for women.<ref name=Nathell>{{cite doi|10.1186/1465-9921-8-89}} [http://respiratory-research.com/content/8/1/89]</ref> 

In restrictive lung disease, the FEV1 ''and'' FVC are equally reduced due to fibrosis or other lung pathology (not obstructive pathology). Thus, the FEV1/FVC ratio should be approximately normal, or even increased due to an increased FEV1 value (because of the decreased compliance associated with the presence of fibrosis in some pathological conditions).<ref name="gp-training.net"/>
