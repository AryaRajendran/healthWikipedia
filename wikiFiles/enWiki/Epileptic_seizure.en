An '''epileptic seizure''' (colloquially a '''fit''') is a transient symptom of "abnormal excessive or [[Neural oscillation|synchronous neuronal activity]] in the brain".<ref name="Fisher2005">{{cite journal|author=Fisher R, van Emde Boas W, Blume W, Elger C, Genton P, Lee P, Engel J|title=Epileptic seizures and epilepsy: definitions proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) and the International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE)|journal=Epilepsia|volume=46|issue=4|pages=470–2|year=2005|pmid=15816939|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0013-9580.2005.66104.x|doi=10.1111/j.0013-9580.2005.66104.x}}</ref> The outward effect can be as dramatic as a wild thrashing movement (tonic-clonic seizure) or as mild as a brief loss of awareness (absence seizure). It can manifest as an alteration in [[:wikt:mental state|mental state]], [[tonic (physiology)|tonic]] or [[clonic]] movements, [[convulsion]]s, and various other psychic symptoms (such as [[déjà vu]] or [[jamais vu]]). Sometimes it is not accompanied by convulsions but a full body "slump", where the person simply will lose body control and slump to the ground. The medical syndrome of recurrent, unprovoked seizures is termed epilepsy, but seizures can occur in people who do not have epilepsy. For more information, see [[non-epileptic seizure]].

[[Epilepsy]] affects more than 50 million people worldwide, nearly 80% of whom live in [[developing country|developing countries]].<ref name="who-2009">{{cite web | url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs999/en/ | title = Epilepsy | series = Fact Sheets |date =October 2012 | accessdate = January 24, 2013 | publisher = [[World Health Organization]]}}</ref> About 4% of all people will have an unprovoked seizure by the age of 80 and the chance of experiencing a second seizure is between 30% and 50%.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11940-004-0016-5|last1=Herman|first1=ST.|year=2004|title=Single Unprovoked Seizures|journal=Curr Treat Options Neurol|volume=6|issue=3|pages=243–255|pmid=15043807}}</ref><ref name="Berg">{{cite journal |last=Berg |first=AT |title=Risk of recurrence after a first unprovoked seizure |journal=Epilepsia |volume=49 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=13–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18184149 |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2008.01444.x}}</ref> Treatment may reduce the chance of a second one by as much as half.<ref name="Berg"/> Most single episode seizures are managed by primary care physicians (emergency or general practitioners), whereas investigation and management of ongoing epilepsy is usually done by neurologists.

==Classification==
{{Main|Seizure types}}
Clinicians organize different types of seizure according to whether the source of the seizure within the brain is localized (''partial-'' or ''focal-''onset seizures) or distributed (''generalized'' seizures). Partial seizures are further divided on the extent to which consciousness is affected ([[simple partial seizures]] and [[complex partial seizures]]). If consciousness is unaffected, then it is a ''simple partial'' seizure; otherwise it is a ''complex partial'' seizure. A partial seizure may spread within the brain—a process known as ''secondary generalization''. Generalized seizures are divided according to the effect on the body, but all involve loss of consciousness. These include [[Absence seizure|absence]], [[Myoclonus|myoclonic]], [[Clonic seizure|clonic]], [[tonic seizure|tonic]], [[Tonic–clonic seizure|tonic–clonic]], and [[Atonic seizure|atonic]] seizures. A ''mixed seizure'' is defined as the existence of both generalized and partial seizures in the same patient.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chen LS, Mitchell WG, Horton EJ, Snead OC |title=Clinical utility of video-EEG monitoring |journal=Pediatr.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Bittentongue.JPG|thumb|Someone who has bitten the tip of their tongue while having a seizure]]
The signs and symptoms of seizures vary depending on the type.<ref name=EB06/> Seizures may cause involuntary changes in body movement or function, sensation, awareness, or behavior. Seizures are often associated with a sudden and involuntary contraction of a group of muscles and loss of consciousness. However, a seizure can also be as subtle as a fleeting numbness of a part of the body, a brief or long term loss of [[memory]], visual changes, sensing/discharging of an unpleasant odor, a strange [[epigastric]] sensation, or a sensation of fear and total state of confusion. A seizure can last from a few seconds to [[status epilepticus]], a continuous group of seizures that is often life-threatening without immediate intervention. Therefore seizures are typically classified as [[motoneuron|motor]], [[sensory neuron|sensory]], [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]], [[emotion]]al or [[cognitive]]. After the active portion of a seizure, there is typically a period referred to as [[postictal]] before a normal [[level of consciousness]] returns.<ref name=EB06/>

In some cases, the full onset of a seizure event is preceded by some of the sensations described above, called [[vertiginous epilepsy]]. These sensations can serve as a warning to that a generalized [[tonic–clonic seizure]] is about to occur. These warning sensations are cumulatively called an [[Aura (symptom)|aura]] and are due to a [[focal seizure]].<ref name=EB06/>

Some patients can tell when a seizure is about to happen. Some symptoms experienced by the person before a seizure may include dizziness, lightheadedness, tightening of the chest, and some experience things in slow-motion just prior to the seizure. Symptoms experienced by a person during a seizure depend on where in the brain the disturbance in electrical activity occurs. Partial and frontal seizures and focal epileptic discharges tend to happen more during sleep than during wakefulness. In contrast, psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are rare between midnight and 6&nbsp;am and never occur during sleep.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1528-1157.1997.tb01077.x | last1 = Bazil | first1 = CW | last2 = Walczak | first2 = TS. | year = 1997 | title = Effects of sleep and sleep stage on epileptic and nonepileptic seizures | url = | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 56–62 | pmid = 9024184 }}</ref> Generalized epilepsy but not focal epilepsy is higher in the morning probably reflecting a [[wikt:diurnal|diurnal]] variation in cortical excitability.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Badawy | first1 = RA | last2 = MacDonell | first2 = RA | last3 = Jackson | first3 = GD | last4 = Berkovic | first4 = SF | title = Why do seizures in generalized epilepsy often occur in the morning? | journal = Neurology | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 218–22 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19620610 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181ae7ca6 }}</ref> A person having a tonic–clonic seizure may cry out, lose consciousness and fall to the ground, and convulse, often violently. A person having a [[complex partial seizure]] may appear confused or dazed and will not be able to respond to questions or direction. Some people have seizures that are not noticeable to others. Sometimes, the only clue that a person is having an [[absence seizure]] is rapid blinking, extreme confusion for a few seconds or sometimes into hours.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==Causes==
{{Main|Seizure trigger}}
Unprovoked seizures are often associated with epilepsy and related [[seizure disorder]]s.

Causes of ''provoked'' seizures include:
* [[dehydration]]
* [[sleep deprivation]]
* [[cavernoma]] or [[cavernous malformation]] is a treatable medical condition that can cause seizures, headaches, and brain hemorrhages.  An MRI can quickly confirm or reject this as a cause.
* [[arteriovenous malformation]] (AVM) is a treatable medical condition that can cause seizures, headaches, and brain hemorrhages.
* [[traumatic brain injury|head injury]] may cause non-epileptic [[post-traumatic seizures]] or [[post-traumatic epilepsy]], in which the seizures chronically recur.
* [[drug overdose]] or toxicity, for example [[aminophylline]] or [[local anaesthetics]]
* normal doses of certain drugs that lower the seizure threshold, such as [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s
* [[infection]], such as [[encephalitis]] or [[meningitis]]
* [[fever]] leading to [[febrile convulsions]] (but see above)
* [[metabolism|metabolic]] disturbances, such as [[hypoglycaemia]], [[hyponatremia]] or [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]
* [[withdrawal]] from drugs ([[anticonvulsant]]s, [[antidepressant]]s, and [[sedative]]s such as [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[barbiturates]], and [[benzodiazepines]],)
* space-occupying lesions in the brain ([[abscess]]es, [[tumour]]s). In people with [[brain tumour]]s, the frequency of epilepsy depends on the location of the tumor in the [[cerebral cortex|cortical region]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hildebrand |first=J |title=Management of epileptic seizures |journal=Curr Opin Oncol |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=314–7 |year=2004 |month=July |pmid=15187884}}</ref>
* seizures during (or shortly after) pregnancy can be a sign of [[eclampsia]].
* seizures in a person with [[hydrocephalus]] may indicate severe [[shunt (medical)|shunt]] failure.
* haemorrhagic [[stroke]] can occasionally present with seizures, [[embolism|embolic]] strokes generally do not (though epilepsy is a common later complication); [[cerebral venous sinus thrombosis]], a rare type of stroke, is more likely to be accompanied by seizures than other types of stroke
* [[multiple sclerosis]] sufferers may rarely experience seizures
* parasitic infections such as cerebral malaria
Some medications produce an increased risk of seizures and [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) deliberately sets out to induce a seizure for the treatment of major depression. Many seizures have unknown causes.

Seizures which are provoked are not associated with epilepsy, and people who experience such seizures are normally not diagnosed with epilepsy. However, the seizures described above resemble those of epilepsy both outwardly, and on [[EEG]] testing.

Seizures can occur after a subject witnesses a traumatic event. This type of seizure is known as a [[psychogenic non-epileptic seizure]] and is related to posttraumatic stress disorder.

==Diagnosis==
Only about 25 percent of people who have a seizure or develop status epilepticus have [[epilepsy]].<ref name="Stasiukyniene-2009">{{Cite journal | last1 = Stasiukyniene | first1 = V. | last2 = Pilvinis | first2 = V. | last3 = Reingardiene | first3 = D. | last4 = Janauskaite | first4 = L. | title = [Epileptic seizures in critically ill patients] | journal = Medicina (Kaunas) | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 501–7 | month =  | year = 2009 | doi =  | pmid = 19605972 }}</ref> It is important to distinguish primary epileptic seizures from secondary causes.

===Physical examination===
Most patients are in a [[postictal state]] following a seizure. In this state they are drowsy and often confused. There may be signs of other injuries. A small study found that finding a bite to the side of the tongue was very helpful when present: while only a quarter of those with seizures had such a bite ([[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] of 24%), the finding was very specific for seizures, with only 1% due to other causes ([[specificity (tests)|specificity]] of 99%).<ref name="pmid7487261">{{cite journal |author=Benbadis SR, Wolgamuth BR, Goren H, Brener S, Fouad-Tarazi F |title=Value of tongue biting in the diagnosis of seizures |journal=Arch.

===Serum prolactin level===
Two [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] have quantified the role of an elevated [[prolactin|serum prolactin]].
The first meta-analysis found that:<ref name="pmid14988379">{{cite journal |author=Ahmad S, Beckett MW |title=Value of serum prolactin in the management of syncope |journal=Emergency medicine journal : EMJ |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=e3 |year=2004 |pmid=14988379 |pmc=1726305 |doi=10.1136/emj.2003.008870}}</ref>
"If a serum prolactin concentration is greater than three times the baseline when taken within one hour of syncope, then in the absence of test "modifiers":
# the patient is nine times more likely to have suffered a GTCS as compared with a pseudoseizure positive LR = 8.92 (95% CI  (1.31 to 60.91)), SN = 0.62 (95% CI (0.40 to 0.83)), SP = 0.89 (95% CI (0.60 to 0.98))

The second meta-analysis found:<ref name="pmid16157897">{{cite journal |author=Chen DK, So YT, Fisher RS |title=Use of serum prolactin in diagnosing epileptic seizures: report of the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology |journal=Neurology |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=668–75 |year=2005 |pmid=16157897 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000178391.96957.d0}}</ref>

# "Serum prolactin assay does not distinguish epileptic seizures from syncope (Level B).
#"The use of serum PRL assay has not been established in the evaluation of status"  epilepticus, repetitive seizures, and neonatal seizures (Level U)."

The serum prolactin level is less [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitive]] for detecting partial seizures.<ref name="pmid15256189">{{cite journal |author=Shukla G, Bhatia M, Vivekanandhan S, ''et al.'' |title=Serum prolactin levels for differentiation of nonepileptic versus true seizures: limited utility |journal=Epilepsy & behavior : E&B |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=517–21 |year=2004 |pmid=15256189 |doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2004.03.004}}</ref>

===EEG===
An isolated abnormal electrical activity recorded by an [[electroencephalography]] examination without a clinical presentation is called [[subclinical seizure]]. They can identify background epileptogenic activity, as well as help identify causes of seizures.

===Determining the underlying cause===
Additional diagnostic methods include [[CT Scan]]ning and [[MRI]] imaging or [[angiography]].  These may show structural lesions within the brain and heart, but the majority of those with epilepsy show nothing unusual.

As seizures have a broad [[differential diagnosis]], it is common for patients to be simultaneously investigated for cardiac and endocrine causes. Checking [[glucose]] levels, for example, is a mandatory action in the management of seizures as [[hypoglycemia]] may cause seizures, and failure to administer glucose would be harmful to the patient. Other causes typically considered are [[Fainting|syncope]] and [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s, and occasionally [[panic attack]]s and [[cataplexy]]. In addition, 5% of patients with a positive [[tilt table test]] may have seizure-like activity that seems to be due to [[cerebral hypoxia]].<ref name="pmid12963568">{{cite journal |author=Passman R, Horvath G, Thomas J, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical spectrum and prevalence of neurologic events provoked by tilt table testing |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=163 |issue=16 |pages=1945–8 |year=2003 |pmid=12963568 |doi=10.1001/archinte.163.16.1945}}</ref> For more information, see [[non-epileptic seizures]].

===Differential===
Differentiating an epileptic seizure from other conditions such as [[Fainting|syncope]] can be difficult.<ref name=EB06/> Other possible conditions that can mimic a seizure include: [[decerebrate posturing]], psychogenic seizures, [[dystonia]], [[migraine headache]]s, and [[strychnine#Symptoms|strychnine poisoning]].<ref name=EB06/>

==Management==
Potentially sharp or dangerous objects should also be moved from the vicinity, so that the individual is not hurt. After the seizure if the person is not fully conscious and alert, they should be placed in the [[recovery position]].

A seizure longer than five minutes is a medical emergency. [[Voluntary caregiver|Caregivers]] may carry medicine.

===Medication===
The treatment of choice for someone who is actively seizing is [[lorazepam]].<ref name=EB10/> This may be repeated if there is no effect after 10 minutes.<ref name=EB10/> If there is no effect after two doses, [[barbiturate]]s or [[propofol]] may be used.<ref name=EB10/> Ongoing medication is not typically needed after a first seizure and is generally only recommended after a second has occurred or those with structural lesions in the brain.<ref name=EB10/> However, in severe cases where patients experience frequent unpredictable seizures everyday, the use of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are recommended to reduce the likelihood and duration of seizures.  Approximately 70% of the patients could have the seizures fully under control with continuous use of medication. The National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) suggests patients taking only one type of AEDs at a time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Epilepsy Society|title=Medication for adults:Treatment of adults aged 13 and over|url=http://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/aboutepilepsy/treatment/medicationforadults|accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref>
