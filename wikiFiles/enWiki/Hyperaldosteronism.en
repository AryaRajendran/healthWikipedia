'''Hyperaldosteronism''', also '''aldosteronism''',<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000002750|aldosteronism}}</ref> is a [[medical condition]] where too much [[aldosterone]] is produced by the [[adrenal glands]], which can lead to lowered levels of [[potassium]] in the [[blood]] also known as [[hypokalemia]].

==Types==
In [[endocrinology]], the terms ''primary'' and ''secondary'' are used to describe the abnormality (e.g., elevated aldosterone) in relation to the defect, i.e., the tumor's location.

===Primary===
{{main|Primary aldosteronism}}
Primary aldosteronism (hyporeninemic hyperaldosteronism) was previously thought to be most commonly caused by an [[adrenal adenoma]], termed [[Conn's syndrome]]. However, recent studies have shown that bilateral idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia is the cause in up to 70% of cases{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}. Differentiating between the two is important as this determines treatment. Also see [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]].
Adrenal carcinoma is an extremely rare cause of primary hyperaldosteronism.
Two familial forms have been identified: Type I ( [[Dexamethasone suppression test|dexamethasone]] suppressible ) and Type II ( that has been linked to 7p22.<ref name="pmid11073536">{{cite journal |author=Lafferty AR, Torpy DJ, Stowasser M, ''et al.'' |title=A novel genetic locus for low renin hypertension: familial hyperaldosteronism type II maps to chromosome 7 (7p22) |journal=J.

'''Features'''
* [[hypertension]]
* [[hypokalemia]] (e.g. may cause muscle weakness)
* [[alkalosis]]

'''Investigations'''
* high serum [[aldosterone]]
* low serum [[renin]]
* high-resolution CT abdomen

'''Management'''
* adrenal adenoma: surgery
* bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia: aldosterone antagonist e.g., [[spironolactone]]

===Secondary ===
*Secondary hyperaldosteronism (also hyperreninism, or hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism) is due to overactivity of the [[renin-angiotensin system]].

''Secondary'' refers to an abnormality that indirectly results in pathology through a predictable physiologic pathway, i.e., a [[renin]] producing tumor leads to increased aldosterone, as the body's aldosterone production is normally regulated by renin levels.

One cause is a [[juxtaglomerular cell tumor]]. Another is [[renal artery stenosis]] in which the reduced blood supply across the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus]] stimulates the production of renin. Also fibromuscular hyperplasia may cause secondary hyperaldosteronism.
Other causes can come from the tubules: hyporeabsorption of sodium (as seen in Bartter and Gitelman syndromes) will lead to hypovolemia/hypotension, which will activate the RAA system.

==Symptoms==
It can be [[asymptomatic]], but the following symptoms may be present:
* [[Fatigue (physical)|Fatigue]]
* [[Headache]]
* [[High blood pressure]]
* [[Hypokalemia]]
* [[Hypernatraemia]]
* [[Hypomagnesemia]]
* Intermittent or temporary [[paralysis]]
* [[Muscle spasms]]
* [[Muscle weakness]]
* [[Numbness]]
* [[Polyuria]]
* [[Polydipsia]]
* Tingling
* [[Metabolic alkalosis]]<ref name="urlHyperaldosteronism: eMedicine Pediatrics: General Medicine">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/920713-overview |title=Hyperaldosteronism: eMedicine Pediatrics: General Medicine |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>

==Diagnostic workup==
When taking a [[blood test]], the [[aldosterone-to-renin]] ratio is abnormally increased in [[primary hyperaldosteronism]], and decreased or normal but with high [[renin]] in secondary hyperaldosteronism.

*[[Glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism]]

==Treatment==
Treatment includes [[Spironolactone]], a [[K+ sparing diuretic]] that works by acting as an [[aldosterone antagonist]].
