{{About|the scientific field|the journal|Genomics (journal)}}
{{Genetics sidebar}}
'''Genomics''' is a discipline in [[genetics]] that applies [[recombinant DNA]], [[DNA sequencing]] methods, and [[bioinformatics]] to sequence, assemble, and analyze the function and structure of [[genome]]s (the ''complete'' set of DNA within a single cell of an organism).<ref name="gov2010"/><ref name="klug2012"/>  The field includes efforts to determine the entire [[DNA sequence]] of organisms and fine-scale [[genetic mapping]].  The field also includes studies of intragenomic phenomena such as [[heterosis]], [[epistasis]], [[pleiotropy]] and other interactions between [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] and [[allele]]s within the genome.<ref name="pevsner2009"/> In contrast, the investigation of the roles and functions of single genes is a primary focus of [[molecular biology]] or [[genetics]] and is a common topic of modern medical and biological research. Research of single genes does not fall into the definition of genomics unless the aim of this genetic, pathway, and functional information analysis is to elucidate its effect on, place in, and response to the entire genome's networks.<ref name="gov2010a"/><ref name="culver2002"/>

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
While the word "genome" (from the [[German language|German]] ''Genom'',
attributed to [[Hans Winkler]]) was in use in [[English language|English]] as
early as 1926,<ref name="oxford"/> the term "genomics" was coined by Dr. Tom Roderick, a [[geneticist]] at the [[Jackson Laboratory]] ([[Bar Harbor, Maine]]), over beer at a meeting held in [[Maryland]] on the mapping of the human genome in 1986.<ref name="yadav2007"/>

=== Early sequencing efforts ===
Following [[James D. Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Francis Crick's]] discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 and [[Fred Sanger|Fred Sanger's]] publication of the [[Amino acid]] sequence of insulin in 1955, nucleic acid sequencing became a major target of early [[molecular biology|molecular biologists]].<ref name="ankeny2003"/> In 1964, [[Robert W. Holley]] and colleagues published the first nucleic acid sequence ever determined, the [[ribonucleic acid|ribonucleotide]] sequence of [[alanine]] [[tRNA|transfer RNA]].<ref name="holley1965a"/><ref name="holley1965b"/> Extending this work, [[Marshall Nirenberg]] and [[Philip Leder]] revealed the triplet nature of the [[genetic code]] and were able to determine the sequences of 54 out of 64 [[codons]] in their experiments.<ref name="pmid5330357"/> In 1972, [[Walter Fiers]] and his team at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of the [[University of Ghent]] ([[Ghent]], [[Belgium]]) were the first to determine the sequence of a gene: the gene for [[Bacteriophage MS2]] coat protein.<ref name="min1972"/> Fiers' group expanded on their MS2 coat protein work, determining the complete nucleotide-sequence of bacteriophage MS2-RNA (whose genome encodes just four genes in 3569 [[base pair]]s &#91;bp&#93;) and [[SV40|Simian virus 40]] in 1976 and 1978, respectively.<ref name="fiers1976"/><ref name="fiers1978"/>

In addition to his seminal work on the amino acid sequence of insulin, [[Frederick Sanger]] and his colleagues played a key role in the development of DNA sequencing techniques that enabled the establishment of comprehensive genome sequencing projects.<ref name="pevsner2009"/> In 1975, he and Alan Coulson published a sequencing procedure using DNA polymerase with radiolabelled nucleotides that he called the ''Plus and Minus technique''.<ref name="tamarin2004"/><ref name="lecture80"/> This involved two closely related methods that generated short oligonucleotides with defined 3' termini. These could be fractionated by [[electrophoresis]] on a [[polyacrylamide]] gel and visualised using autoradiography. The procedure could sequence up to 80 nucleotides in one go and was a big improvement on what gone before but was still very laborious.  Nevertheless, in 1977 his group was able to sequence most of the 5,386 nucleotides of the single-stranded [[bacteriophage]] [[Phi X 174|φX174]], completing the first fully sequenced DNA-based genome.<ref name="sanger1977"/> The refinement of the ''Plus and Minus'' method resulted in the chain-termination, or [[Sanger method]] (see [[Genomics#Shotgun sequencing|below]]), which formed the basis of the techniques of DNA sequencing, genome mapping, data storage, and bioinformatic analysis most widely used in the following quarter-century of research.<ref name="kaiser2003"/><ref name="sanger1977a"/> In the same year [[Walter Gilbert]] and [[Allan Maxam]] of [[Harvard University]] independently developed the [[Maxam-Gilbert sequencing|Maxam-Gilbert]] method (also known as the ''chemical method'') of DNA sequencing, involving the preferential cleavage of DNA at known bases, a less efficient method.<ref name="gilbert1977"/><ref name="darden2010"/> For their groundbreaking work in the sequencing of nucleic acids, Gilbert and Sanger shared half the 1980 [[Nobel Prize]] in chemistry with [[Paul Berg]] ([[recombinant DNA]]).

=== Complete genomes ===
The advent of these technologies resulted in a rapid intensification in the scope and speed of completion of [[Genome project|genome sequencing projects]]. The first complete genome sequence of an [[eukaryotic organelle]], the human [[mitochondrion]] (16,568 bp, about 16.6 kb &#91;kilobase&#93;), was reported in 1981,<ref name="anderson1981"/> and the first [[chloroplast]] genomes followed in 1986.<ref name="shinozaki1986"/><ref name="ohyama1986"/> In 1992, the first eukaryotic [[chromosome]], chromosome III of brewer's yeast ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' (315 kb) was sequenced.<ref name="oliver1992"/> The first free-living organism to be sequenced was that of ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' (1.8 Mb &#91;megabase&#93;) in 1995.<ref name="fleischmann1995"/> The following year a consortium of researchers from laboratories across [[North America]], [[Europe]], and [[Japan]] announced the completion of the first complete genome sequence of a eukaryote, ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|S. cerevisiae]]'' (12.1 Mb), and since then genomes have continued being sequenced at an exponentially growing pace.<ref name="goffeau1996"/> {{As of|2011|October}}, the complete sequences are available for: 2,719 [[virus]]es, 1,115 [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]], and 36 [[eukaryote]]s, of which about half are [[fungi]].<ref name="viruses2011"/><ref name="entrez2011"/> 

[[File:Number of prokaryotic genomes and sequencing costs.svg|left|thumb|300px|The number of genome projects has increased as technological improvements continue to lower the cost of sequencing.

'''(C)''' The cost in USD to sequence a 3,000 Mb (human-sized) genome on a log-transformed scale.|alt="Hockey stick" graph showing the exponential growth of public sequence databases.]]

Most of the microorganisms whose genomes have been completely sequenced are problematic [[pathogen]]s, such as ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', which has resulted in a pronounced bias in their phylogenetic distribution compared to the breadth of microbial diversity.<ref name="zimmer2009a"/><ref name="geba2009"/> Of the other sequenced species, most were chosen because they were well-studied model organisms or promised to become good models. Yeast (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') has long been an important [[model organism]] for the [[eukaryotic cell]], while the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' has been a very important tool (notably in early pre-molecular [[genetics]]). The worm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' is an often used simple model for [[multicellular organism]]s. The zebrafish ''[[Brachydanio rerio]]'' is used for many developmental studies on the molecular level, and the flower ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is a model organism for flowering plants.  The [[Japanese pufferfish]] (''[[Takifugu rubripes]]'') and the  [[spotted green pufferfish]] (''[[Tetraodon nigroviridis]]'') are interesting because of their small and compact genomes, which contain very little [[noncoding DNA]] compared to most species.<ref name="bbc2004"/><ref name="yue2001"/> The mammals dog (''[[Canis familiaris]]''),<ref name="nhgriDog2004"/> brown rat (''[[Rattus norvegicus]]''), mouse (''[[Mus musculus]]''), and chimpanzee (''[[Pan troglodytes]]'') are all important model animals in medical research.<ref name="darden2010"/>

A rough draft of the [[human genome]] was completed by the [[Human Genome Project]] in early 2001, creating much fanfare.<ref name="mcelheny2010"/> This project, completed in 2003, sequenced the entire genome for one specific person, and by 2007 this sequence was declared "finished" (less than one error in 20,000 bases and all chromosomes assembled).<ref name='mcelheny2010'/> In the years since then, the genomes of many other individuals have been sequenced, partly under the auspices of the [[1000 Genomes Project]], which announced the sequencing of 1,092 genomes in October 2012.<ref name="1000genomes2012"/> Completion of this project was made possible by the development of dramatically more efficient sequencing technologies and required the commitment of significant [[bioinformatics]] resources from a large international collaboration.<ref name="neilsen2012"/> The continued analysis of human genomic data has profound political and social repercussions for human societies.<ref name="barnes2008"/>

=== The "omics" revolution ===
{{Main|Omics}}

The English-language [[neologism]] '''omics''' informally refers to a field of study in [[biology]] ending in ''-omics'', such as genomics, [[proteomics]] or [[metabolomics]]. The related suffix '''-ome''' is used to address the objects of study of such fields, such as the [[genome]], [[proteome]] or [[metabolome]] respectively. The suffix ''-ome'' as used in molecular biology refers to a ''totality'' of some sort; similarly '''omics''' has come to refer generally to the study of large, comprehensive biological data sets. While the growth in the use of the term has led some scientists ([[Jonathan Eisen]], among others<ref>{{cite doi|10.1186/2047-217X-1-6}}</ref>) to claim that it has been oversold,<ref name="wsj2012">{{Cite news

== Genome analysis ==
{{Main|Genome project}}
After an organism has been selected, genome projects involve three components: the sequencing of DNA, the assembly of that sequence to create a representation of the original chromosome,  and the annotation and analysis of that representation.<ref name="pevsner2009"/>
[[File:Genome sequencing project flowchart.svg|thumb|width300px|Overview of a genome project. First, the genome must be selected, which involves several factors including cost and relevance. Second, the sequence is generated and assembled at a given sequencing center (such as [[Beijing Genomics Institute|BGI]] or [[Joint Genome Institute|JGI]]). Third, the genome sequence is annotated at several levels: DNA, protein, gene pathways, or comparatively.]]

=== Sequencing ===
{{Main|DNA Sequencing}}
Historically, sequencing was done in ''sequencing centers'', centralized facilities (ranging from large independent institutions such as [[Joint Genome Institute]] which sequence dozens of terabases a year, to local molecular biology core facilities)  which contain research laboratories with the costly instrumentation and technical support necessary. As sequencing technology continues to improve, however, a new generation of effective fast turnaround benchtop sequencers has come within reach of the average academic laboratory.<ref name="baker2012blog"/><ref name="quail2012"/> On the whole, genome sequencing approaches fall into two broad categories, ''shotgun'' and ''high-throughput'' (aka ''next-generation'') sequencing.<ref name="pevsner2009"/>

==== Shotgun sequencing ====
<!-- [[File:Sanger-sequencing.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|The Sanger (chain-termination) method for DNA sequencing.]] -->
[[Image:ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer 3.jpg|left|thumbnail|An ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer. Such capillary sequencers automated early large-scale genome sequencing efforts.]]
{{main|Sanger sequencing}}
Shotgun sequencing (Sanger sequencing is used interchangeably) is a sequencing method designed for analysis of DNA sequences longer than 1000 base pairs, up to and including entire chromosomes.<ref name=Staden /> It is named by analogy with the rapidly expanding, quasi-random firing pattern of a [[shotgun]]. Since the [[DNA sequencing#Chain-termination methods|chain termination]] method of [[DNA sequencing]] can only be used for fairly short strands (100 to 1000 basepairs), longer DNA sequences must be broken into random small segments which are then sequenced to obtain ''reads''. Multiple overlapping reads for the target DNA are obtained by performing several rounds of this fragmentation and sequencing. Computer programs then use the overlapping ends of different reads to assemble them into a continuous sequence.<ref name="Staden"/><ref name="anderson1981a"/>  Shotgun sequencing is a random sampling process, requiring over-sampling to ensure a given [[nucleotide]] is represented in the reconstructed sequence; the average number of reads by which a genome is over-sampled is referred to as [[Shotgun sequencing#Coverage|coverage]].<ref name="pop2008"/>

For much of its history, the technology underlying shotgun sequencing was the classical chain-termination method, which is based on the selective incorporation of chain-terminating [[dideoxynucleotide]]s by [[DNA polymerase]] during [[in vitro]] [[DNA replication]].<ref name="sanger1977"/><ref name="sanger1975"/> Developed by [[Frederick Sanger]] and colleagues in 1977, it was the most widely used sequencing method for approximately 25 years. More recently, Sanger sequencing has been supplanted by [[Dna sequencing#Next-generation methods|"Next-Gen"]] sequencing methods, especially for large-scale, automated [[genome]] analyses. However, the Sanger method remains in wide use in 2012, primarily for smaller-scale projects and for obtaining especially long contiguous DNA sequence reads (>500 nucleotides).<ref name=mavro2012/> Chain-termination methods require a single-stranded DNA template, a DNA [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]], a [[DNA polymerase]], normal deoxynucleosidetriphosphates (dNTPs), and modified nucleotides (dideoxyNTPs) that terminate DNA strand elongation. These chain-terminating nucleotides lack a 3'-[[hydroxyl|OH]] group required for the formation of a [[phosphodiester bond]] between two nucleotides, causing DNA polymerase to cease extension of DNA when a ddNTP is incorporated. The ddNTPs may be radioactively or [[fluorescence|fluorescent]]ly labelled for detection in automated sequencing machines.<ref name=pevsner2009/> Typically, these automated DNA-sequencing instruments ([[DNA sequencers]]) can sequence up to 96 DNA samples in a single batch (run) in up to 48 runs a day.<ref name="illumina2012"/>

==== High-throughput sequencing ====
The high demand for low-cost sequencing has driven the development of high-throughput sequencing (or next-generation sequencing [NGS]) technologies that [[multiplex (assay)|parallelize]] the sequencing process, producing thousands or millions of sequences at once.<ref name="hall2007"/><ref name="church2005"/> High-throughput sequencing technologies are intended to lower the cost of DNA sequencing beyond what is possible with standard dye-terminator methods. In ultra-high-throughput sequencing as many as 500,000 sequencing-by-synthesis operations may be run in parallel.<ref name="tenBosch2008"/><ref name="Tucker2009"/>

While NGS methods' high throughput are associated with the sequencing of large eukaryotic genomes,  their scalability gives them applications in the sequencing of smaller prokaryotic genomes.<ref name="illumina2012"/> In a December 2012 comparison of NGS technologies, researchers from the [[Integrated Microbial Genomes]] project found comparison <ref name="mavro2012"/>

===== Illumina (Solexa) sequencing =====
[[File:Illumina Genome Analyzer II System.jpg|thumb|Illumina Genome Analyzer II System. Illumina technologies have set the standard for high throughput massively parallel sequencing.<ref name="baker2012blog"/>]]
[[Solexa]], now part of [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]], developed a sequencing method based on reversible dye-terminators technology acquired from [[Manteia Predictive Medicine]] in 2004.  This technology had been invented and developed in late 1996 at Glaxo-Welcome's Geneva Biomedical Research Institute (GBRI), by Dr. Pascal Mayer and Dr Laurent Farinelli.<ref name="DNA_colony_patents"/> In this method, DNA molecules and primers are first attached on a slide and amplified with [[polymerase]] so that local clonal colonies, initially coined "DNA colonies", are formed. To determine the sequence, four types of reversible terminator bases (RT-bases) are added and non-incorporated nucleotides are washed away. Unlike pyrosequencing, the DNA chains are extended one nucleotide at a time and image acquisition can be performed at a delayed moment, allowing for very large arrays of DNA colonies to be captured by sequential images taken from a single camera. 

Decoupling the enzymatic reaction and the image capture allows for optimal throughput and theoretically unlimited sequencing capacity.  With an optimal configuration, the ultimately reachable instrument throughput is thus dictated solely by the analogic-to-digital conversion rate of the camera, multiplied by the number of cameras and divided by the number of pixels per DNA colony required for visualizing them optimally (approximately 10 pixels/colony). In 2012, with cameras operating at more than 10&nbsp;MHz A/D conversion rates and available optics, fluidics and enzymatics, throughput can be multiples of 1 million nucleotides/second, corresponding roughly to 1 human genome equivalent at 1x coverage per hour per instrument, and 1 human genome re-sequenced (at approx. 30x) per day per instrument (equipped with a single camera). The camera takes images of the [[Fluorescent labeling|fluorescently labeled]] nucleotides, then the dye along with the terminal 3' blocker is chemically removed from the DNA, allowing the next cycle.<ref name="mardis2008"/>

 }}
[[Sequence assembly]] refers to [[sequence alignment|aligning]] and merging fragments of a much longer [[DNA]] sequence in order to reconstruct the original sequence.<ref name="pevsner2009"/> This is needed as current [[DNA sequencing]] technology cannot read whole genomes as a continuous sequence, but rather reads small pieces of between 20 and 1000 bases, depending on the technology used. Typically the short fragments, called reads, result from [[shotgun sequencing]] [[genome|genomic]] DNA, or [[Transcription (genetics)|gene transcript]]s ([[expressed sequence tag|ESTs]]).<ref name="pevsner2009"/>

==== Assembly approaches ====
Assembly can be broadly categorized into two approaches: ''de novo'' assembly, for genomes which are not similar to any sequenced in the past, and comparative assembly which use the existing sequence of a closely related organism as a reference during assembly.<ref name="pop2008">{{cite doi| 10.1093/bib/bbp026}}</ref> Relative to comparative assembly, ''de novo'' assembly is computationally difficult ([[NP-hard]]), making it less favorable for short-read NGS technologies.

==== Finishing ====
Finished genomes are defined as having a single contiguous sequence with no ambiguities representing each [[Replicon (genetics)|replicon]].<ref name="finishing"/>

=== Annotation ===
The DNA sequence assembly alone is of little value without additional analysis.<ref name='pevsner2009'/> '''Genome annotation''' is the process of attaching biological information to [[DNA sequence|sequences]], and consists of three main steps:<ref name="Stein2001"/>
# identifying portions of the genome that do not code for proteins
# identifying elements on the [[genome]], a process called [[gene prediction]], and
# attaching biological information to these elements.
Automatic annotation tools try to perform these steps ''[[in silico]]'', as opposed to manual annotation (a.k.a. curation) which involves human expertise and potential experimental verification.<ref name="brent2008"/> Ideally, these approaches co-exist and complement each other in the same annotation [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]] (also see [[Genomics#Sequencing pipelines|below]]).

Traditionally, the basic level of annotation is using [[BLAST]] for finding similarities, and then annotating genomes based on homolouges.<ref name="pevsner2009"/> More recently, additional information is added to the annotation platform. The additional information allows manual annotators to deconvolute discrepancies between genes that are given the same annotation. Some databases use genome context information, similarity scores, experimental data, and integrations of other resources to provide genome annotations through their Subsystems approach. Other databases (e.g. [[Ensembl]]) rely on both curated data sources as well as a range of software tools in their automated genome annotation pipeline.<ref name="ensmbl2013"/> ''Structural annotation'' consists of the identification of genomic elements, primarily [[Open reading frame|ORFs]] and their localisation, or gene structure. ''Functional annotation'' consists of attaching biological information to genomic elements.

=== Sequencing pipelines and databases ===
<!-- [[File:Integrated microbial genomes.jpg|thumb|Genome analysis tools in Integrated Microbial Genomes (v. 2.9) pipeline.]] -->
The need for reproducibility and efficient management of the large amount of data associated with genome projects mean that [[Pipeline (software)|computational pipelines]] have important applications in genomics.<ref name="bioinfMethods"/>

== Research areas ==

=== Functional genomics ===
{{main|Functional genomics}}
[[Functional genomics]] is a field of [[molecular biology]] that attempts to make use of the vast wealth of data produced by genomic projects (such as [[genome project|genome sequencing projects]]) to describe [[gene]] (and [[protein]]) functions and interactions. Functional genomics focuses on the dynamic aspects such as gene [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], [[translation (biology)|translation]], and [[protein–protein interaction]]s, as opposed to the static aspects of the genomic information such as [[DNA sequence]] or structures. Functional genomics attempts to answer questions about the function of DNA at the levels of genes, RNA transcripts, and protein products. A key characteristic of functional genomics studies is their genome-wide approach to these questions, generally involving high-throughput methods rather than a more traditional “gene-by-gene” approach.

A major branch of genomics is still concerned with [[sequencing]] the genomes of various organisms, but the knowledge of full genomes has created the possibility for the field of [[functional genomics]], mainly concerned with patterns of [[gene expression]] during various conditions. The most important tools here are [[microarray]]s and [[bioinformatics]].

=== Structural genomics ===
{{Main|Structural genomics}}
[[File:Argonne's Midwest Center for Structural Genomics deposits 1,000th protein structure.jpg|An example of a protein structure determined by the Midwest Center for Structural Genomics.|thumb|300px]]
[[Structural genomics]] seeks to describe the [[Protein Structure|3-dimensional structure]] of every protein encoded by a given [[genome]].<ref name="marsden2007"/><ref name="brenner2000"/> This genome-based approach allows for a high-throughput method of structure determination by a combination of [[protein structure prediction|experimental and modeling approaches]]. The principal difference between structural genomics and [[protein structure prediction|traditional structural prediction]] is that structural genomics attempts to determine the structure of every protein encoded by the genome, rather than focusing on one particular protein. With full-genome sequences available, structure prediction can be done more quickly through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, especially because the availability of large number of sequenced genomes and previously solved protein structures allows scientists to model protein structure on the structures of previously solved homologs. Structural genomics involves taking a large number of approaches to structure determination, including experimental methods using genomic sequences or modeling-based approaches based on sequence or [[homology modeling|structural homology]] to a protein of known structure or based on chemical and physical principles for a protein with no homology to any known structure. As opposed to traditional [[structural biology]], the determination of a [[protein structure]] through a structural genomics effort often (but not always) comes before anything is known regarding the protein function. This raises new challenges in [[structural bioinformatics]], i.e. determining protein function from its [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] structure.<ref name="brenner2001"/>

=== Epigenomics ===
{{Main|Epigenomics}}
[[Epigenomics]] is the study of the complete set of [[epigenetic]] modifications on the genetic material of a cell, known as the [[epigenome]].<ref name="francis2011"/>   Epigenetic modifications are reversible modifications on a cell’s DNA or histones that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence (Russell 2010 p.&nbsp;475).  Two of the most characterized epigenetic modifications are [[DNA methylation]] and [[Epigenetics#DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling|histone modification]].  Epigenetic modifications play an important role in gene expression and regulation, and are involved in numerous cellular processes such as in [[Epigenetics#Development|differentiation/development]] and [[Epigenetics#Cancer and developmental abnormalities|tumorigenesis]].<ref name="francis2011"/>  The study of epigenetics on a global level has been made possible only recently through the adaptation of genomic high-throughput assays.<ref name="laird2010"/>

=== Metagenomics ===
[[File:Environmental shotgun sequencing.png|thumb|right|upright|Environmental Shotgun Sequencing (ESS) is a key technique in metagenomics. (A) Sampling from habitat; (B) filtering particles, typically by size; (C) Lysis and DNA extraction; (D) cloning and library construction; (E) sequencing the clones; (F) sequence assembly into contigs and scaffolds.]]

{{Main|Metagenomics}}
[[Metagenomics]] is the study of ''metagenomes'', [[genetics|genetic]] material recovered directly from [[Natural environment|environmental]] samples.  The broad field may also be referred to as environmental genomics, ecogenomics or community genomics. While traditional [[microbiology]] and microbial [[genome sequencing]] rely upon cultivated [[clone (genetics)|clonal]] [[microbiological culture|cultures]], early environmental gene sequencing cloned specific genes (often the [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]] gene) to produce a [[microbial ecology|profile of diversity]] in a natural sample.  Such work revealed that the vast majority of [[biodiversity|microbial biodiversity]] had been missed by [[Microbiological culture|cultivation-based]] methods.<ref name="Hugenholz1998"/> Recent studies use "shotgun" [[chain termination method|Sanger sequencing]] or massively parallel [[pyrosequencing]] to get largely unbiased samples of all genes from all the members of the sampled communities.<ref name="Eisen2007"/> Because of its power to reveal the previously hidden diversity of microscopic life, metagenomics offers a powerful lens for viewing the microbial world that has the potential to revolutionize understanding of the entire living world.<ref name="MarcoD"/><ref name="MarcoD2011"/>

=== Study systems===

==== Viruses and bacteriophages ====

[[Bacteriophage]]s have played and continue to play a key role in bacterial [[genetics]] and [[molecular biology]]. Historically, they were used to define [[gene]] structure and gene regulation. Also the first [[genome]] to be sequenced was a [[bacteriophage]]. However, bacteriophage research did not lead the genomics revolution, which is clearly dominated by bacterial genomics. Only very recently has the study of bacteriophage genomes become prominent, thereby enabling researchers to understand the mechanisms underlying [[phage]] evolution.  Bacteriophage genome sequences can be obtained through direct sequencing of isolated bacteriophages, but can also be derived as part of microbial genomes. Analysis of bacterial genomes has shown that a substantial amount of microbial DNA consists of [[prophage]] sequences and prophage-like elements.<ref name="canchaya2003"/> A detailed database mining of these sequences offers insights into the role of prophages in shaping the bacterial genome.<ref name="McGrath"/><ref name="fouts2005"/>

==== Cyanobacteria ====

At present there are 24 [[cyanobacteria]] for which a total genome sequence is available. 15 of these cyanobacteria come from the marine environment. These are six ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' strains, seven marine ''[[Synechococcus]]'' strains, ''[[Trichodesmium erythraeum]]'' IMS101 and ''[[Crocosphaera watsonii]]'' [[WH8501]]. Several studies have demonstrated how these sequences could be used very successfully to infer important ecological and physiological characteristics of marine cyanobacteria. However, there are many more genome projects currently in progress, amongst those there are further ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' and marine ''[[Synechococcus]]'' isolates, ''[[Acaryochloris]]'' and ''[[Prochloron]]'', the N<sub>2</sub>-fixing filamentous cyanobacteria ''[[Nodularia spumigena]]'', ''[[Lyngbya aestuarii]]'' and ''[[Lyngbya majuscula]]'', as well as [[bacteriophage]]s infecting marine cyanobaceria. Thus, the growing body of genome information can also be tapped in a more general way to address global problems by applying a comparative approach. Some new and exciting examples of progress in this field are the identification of genes for regulatory RNAs, insights into the evolutionary origin of [[photosynthesis]], or estimation of the contribution of horizontal gene transfer to the genomes that have been analyzed.<ref name="Herrero"/>
