The '''levator ani'''  is a broad, thin [[muscle]], situated on the side of the [[pelvis]].

It is attached to the inner surface of the side of the lesser pelvis, and unites with its fellow of the opposite side to form the greater part of the floor of the pelvic cavity.

It supports the viscera in pelvic cavity, and surrounds the various structures that pass through it.

In combination with the [[coccygeus muscle]], it forms the [[pelvic diaphragm]].

==Parts==
The levator ani is divided into three parts:
* [[Iliococcygeus muscle]]
* [[Pubococcygeus muscle]]
* [[Puborectalis muscle]]

==Origin and insertion==
The levator ani arises, in front, from the posterior surface of the superior ramus of the [[pubis (bone)|pubis]] lateral to the [[pubic symphysis|symphysis]]; behind, from the inner surface of the spine of the [[ischium]]; and between these two points, from the [[obturator fascia]].

Posteriorly, this fascial origin corresponds, more or less closely, with the tendinous arch of the pelvic fascia, but in front, the muscle arises from the fascia at a varying distance above the arch, in some cases reaching nearly as high as the canal for the obturator vessels and nerve.

The fibers pass downward and backward to the middle line of the floor of the pelvis; the most posterior are inserted into the side of the last two segments of the [[coccyx]]; those placed more anteriorly unite with the muscle of the opposite side, in a median fibrous raphé (anococcygeal raphé), which extends between the coccyx and the margin of the [[anus]].

The middle fibers are inserted into the side of the [[rectum]], blending with the fibers of the Sphincter muscles; lastly, the anterior fibers descend upon the side of the prostate to unite beneath it with the muscle of the opposite side, joining with the fibers of the [[Sphincter ani externus muscle|sphincter ani externus]] and [[transversus perinei (disambiguation)|transversus perinei]], at the central tendinous point of the [[perineum]].

The anterior portion is occasionally separated from the rest of the muscle by connective tissue.

From this circumstance, as well as from its peculiar relation with the [[prostate]], which it supports as in a sling, it has been described as a distinct muscle, under the name of ''levator prostatæ''.

In the female the anterior fibers of the levator ani descend upon the side of the [[vagina]].

==Innervation==
The levator ani muscles are mostly innervated by the [[pudendal nerve]], [[perineal nerve]] and [[inferior rectal nerve]] in concert.<ref name=grigorescu>{{cite journal |author=Grigorescu BA |title=Innervation of the levator ani muscles: description of the nerve branches to the pubococcygeus, iliococcygeus, and puborectalis muscles |journal=Int Urogynecol J Pelvic Floor Dysfunct |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=107–116 |year=2008 |pmid=17565421 |doi=10.1007/s00192-007-0395-8 |author-separator=, |author2=Lazarou G |author3=Olson TR |display-authors=3 |last4=Downie |first4=Sherry A. |last5=Powers |first5=Kenneth |last6=Greston |first6=Wilma Markus |last7=Mikhail |first7=Magdy S.}}</ref> In addition, [[sacral spinal nerves]] ([[sacral spinal nerve 3|S3]], [[sacral spinal nerve 4|S4]]) innervate the muscles directly as well (in ~70% <ref name=grigorescu/> of people). Sometimes (in ~40% <ref name=grigorescu/> of people) the inferior rectal nerve innervates the levator ani muscles independently of the pudendal nerve.

==Tail-wagging in animals==
The levator ani muscles, in [[quadruped]] animals with tails, are responsible for moving the tail around in the act of "wagging." These muscles are not as strong as their human equivalents, as tail-wagging is more demanding than the support function that the muscles serve in humans.<ref>Sloan, Ethel (2001, p. 53).

==Levator ani syndrome==
'''Levator ani syndrome''' (also known as '''levator syndrome''' and '''proctodynia''') is episodic [[rectum|rectal]] pain, caused by spasm of the levator ani muscle.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}  The [[etiology (medicine)|etiology]] is unknown, however it has been suggested that inflammation of the arcus tendon is the possible cause of levator ani syndrome[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15526112]

[[Symptom]]s include a dull ache to the left 2&nbsp;inches above the Anus or higher in the rectum and a feeling of constant rectal pressure or burning.  The pain may also be felt in the low [[pelvis]] or [[perineum]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The discomfort may be relieved by walking or pelvic tightening exercises similar to [[Kegel exercise]]s.  Other treatments include [[massage]] of the muscle, warm baths, [[muscle relaxant]] medications, [[therapeutic ultrasound]] and [[biofeedback]].  Electrical stimulation of the levator ani muscle has been used to try to break the spastic cycle.  Injection of [[botulinum toxin|botulinum toxin A]] has also been used.

Variants of levator ani syndrome include [[proctalgia fugax]] (fleeting pain in the rectum) and [[coccydynia]] (pain in the [[coccyx|coccygeal]] region).  Proctalgia fugax and levator ani syndrome have not been found to be of psychosomatic origin, although stressful events may trigger attacks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
