'''Added sugar(s)''' refer to [[sugar]] [[carbohydrates]] ([[caloric]] [[sweeteners]]) added to [[food]] and [[beverage]]s during its production ([[Convenience food|industrial processing]]).<ref name="AllenPrentice2012"/><ref name=welsh/> This type of sugar is chemically indistinguishable from naturally occurring ones, but the term "added sugar" has become increasingly used in nutrition and medicine, to help identify foods characterized by added energy.<ref name=welsh/> Added sugars have no nutritional value, only adding "[[empty calories]]".<ref name="AllenPrentice2012"/> Consumption of added sugar is positively correlated with high calorie intake, and through it, with excess weight and [[obesity]].<ref name="AllenPrentice2012"/>  Added sugars are also known as extrinsic, and naturally occurring ones, as intrinsic.<ref name="SymbolsMedicine2010"/>

The consumption of added sugars has been positively associated with multiple measures known to increase [[cardiovascular disease]] risk amongst adolescents as well as adults.<ref name="Consumption of Added Sugars and Indicators of Cardiovascular Disease Risk Among US Adolescents"/> They are also a [[risk factor]] for [[Type 2 Diabetes]] and [[high blood pressure]], and increase of body weight and obesity.<ref name="AllenPrentice2012"/><ref name=welsh/>

==Added sugar consumption in the United States==
In the USA the most popular types of added sugar are [[sucrose]] (table sugar) and [[high-fructose corn syrup]], both primarily composed of about half [[glucose]] and half [[fructose]].<ref name=welsh/> Other types of added sugar include: all types of [[beet sugar|beet]] and [[cane sugar]]s, all types of [[corn syrup]] (including solids), [[malt syrup]], [[maple syrup]], [[pancake syrup]], [[fructose sweetener]], [[liquid fructose]], [[fruit juice concentrate]], [[honey]], [[molasses]], [[anhydrous dextrose]], and [[crystal dextrose]].<ref name="SymbolsMedicine2010"/> The most common types of foods containing added sugars are [[sweetened beverage]]s such as most [[Soft drink|sodas]].<ref name="AllenPrentice2012"/><ref name=welsh/> In the [[United States]], 20% of daily calorie consumption comes from that single source.<ref name="AllenPrentice2012"/> [[World Health Organization]] recommends that this number should be no higher than 10%.<ref name="AllenPrentice2012"/> 13% of American population receives over 25% of their calories from added sugars, which often means they are not getting enough of other key nutrients.<ref name="Intake of Added Sugars and Selected Nutrients in the United States, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003—2006"/>

Data collected in multiple nationwide surveys in the USA from mid-1970s show that the intake of added sugars has increased by over 35%.<ref name=welsh/> However, new data collected between 1999 and 2008 show that the intake of added sugars has declined by 23.4 percent with declines occurring in all age, ethnic and income groups.<ref name="welsh"/><ref name="Reducing sugar intake"/> Welsh et al. note that the decrease in added sugar consumption in the USA is related to decrease in the consumption of sweetened beverage, encouraged by the government health awareness initiatives and other programs.<ref name=welsh/>
