'''Parastremmatic dwarfism''' is a rare [[osteochondrodysplasia|bone disease]] that features severe [[dwarfism]], thoracic [[kyphosis]] (a type of [[scoliosis]] that affects the upper back), a distortion and twisting of the limbs, [[contracture]]s of the large joints, malformations of the [[vertebra]]e and [[pelvis]], and [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]]. The disease was first reported in 1970 by Leonard Langer and associates; they used the term ''parastremmatic'' from the Greek ''parastremma'', or ''distorted limbs'', to describe it. On [[X-ray]]s, the disease is distinguished by a "flocky" or lace-like appearance to the bones.<ref name=pdad/> The disease is [[congenital disorder|congenital]], which means it is apparent at birth. It is caused by a [[mutation]] in the ''[[TRPV4]]'' gene, located on [[chromosome 12 (human)|chromosome 12]] in humans. The disease is inherited in an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] manner.<ref name=pdad/><ref name=pd70/><ref name=pdgene/>

== Characteristics ==

Parastremmatic dwarfism is apparent at birth, with affected infants usually being described as "stiff", or as "twisted dwarfs" when the skeletal deformities and appearance of dwarfism further present themselves. Skeletal deformities usually develop in the sixth to twelfth month of an infant's life. The deformities may be attributed to [[osteomalacia]], a lack of [[bone mineralization]].

== Cause and genetics ==

[[File:Chromosome 12.svg|thumb|left|90px|The location of genes on chromosome 12]]
Parastremmatic dwarfism is caused by a [[missense mutation]] (where one [[amino acid]] is replaced by another in a [[gene sequence]]) in the ''[[TRPV4]]'' gene,<ref name=pdgene/> [[locus (genetics)|located]] on the long arm of human [[chromosome]] [[chromosome 12 (human)|12]], at 12q24.11.<ref name=omim/> The mutation is in [[exon]] 11 of the gene, and is labelled R594H; this means that the [[codon]] (the code for an amino acid molecule) for [[arginine]] was erroneously substituted by a codon for [[histidine]] at position 594 in that exon. This same mutation in the ''TRVP4'' gene is known to cause the [[spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Kozlowski type|Kozlowski type]] of [[spondylometaphyseal dysplasia]].<ref name=pdgene/><ref name=pdog/> 

Parastremmatic dwarfism is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner,<ref name=pdbk/> which means that the defective gene responsible for the disease is located on an [[autosome]] (chromosome 12 is an autosome), and one copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the disorder when inherited from a parent who also has the disorder.<ref name=pdad/>
