He was born on April 20, 1932 displaced in Antioch, French Protectorate, Syria, from parents who were forced to leave their homeland of Western Armenia, and were orphaned survivors of the Armenian holocaust and genocide during 1915. He received his university education and a Medical Research Council Award at St. Edmund Hall, Oxford University (BA’64, MA’69), received his medical education, a Middlesex Award and a Suckling Research Prize at University College London, University of London (MD’57), and was the first surgeon conferred the research degrees (ScM’67, ScD’69) in Nutrition, Immunology, and Genetics from Harvard University. His academic appointments have included: Founding Chief and Faculty Member of the Division of Immunology and Laboratory, Department of Surgery, Peter Bent Brigham Hospital at Harvard Medical School in Boston; Founder of the first interdisciplinary credit course on Transplantation Biology and Medicine at Harvard Medical School; Assistant Professor of Surgery, and Committee on Immunology, University of Chicago, Professor of Surgery, Director, and Chief, Division of Renal Transplantation at Hahnemann University in Philadelphia; Chair, Department of Surgery with 190 faculty members and 25 resident trainees, and Associate Vice President for Medical Affairs at St. John Hospital Medical Center in Detroit; Clinical Professor of Surgery, Georgetown University Medical Center, and Founding President and CEO, the nation's oldest Vein Institute in Metropolitan Washington, DC.

==Service==
He has served in philanthropy in twelve universities in the USA and abroad. Joint Simon J. Simonian Awards are conferred annually in “Leadership” at Oxford, in “Nutrition” at Tufts and Harvard, in “Pathology” at Harvard. The "Surgery" Award at Harvard is held jointly with Nobel Laureate Joseph E. Murray. Since 1992, a Simonian award has been offered annually in Surgery at Georgetown University Medical Center. He is recognized as a participant in the eradication of smallpox, and as one of the leaders in the establishment of Immunogenetics, Kidney Transplantation, Phlebology and Lymphology as new medical specialties. He co-established the first successful Venous Vascular Phlebology program at Georgetown University Hospital. He has lectured extensively both nationally and internationally. He is the co-author of over 300 articles and four books that span his four major research interests: immunology and immunogenetics, organ transplantation, venous vascular disease, and lymphatic vascular disease.<ref>"Simon John Simonian," ''Marquis Who's Who'', Marquis Who's Who, 2009, 2010, 2011.

==Contributions==
His research contributions include: 
# Research assistance in the production of the first freeze-dried, heat-stable globally effective sheep-pox vaccine subsequently used by [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) for the first eradication of a disease in history: smallpox, in 1977, which is saving two million lives annually and is a Nobel Prize nominee.
# Co-discovery of the genetic control of antibody formation in the rat, in 1966, which helped establish Immunogenetics as a new biomedical specialty, and is helping matching organ transplants, resolve autoimmune and other chronic human diseases. Months earlier unknown to him a colleague using the guinea pig had obtained identical results, and deservedly received a Nobel Prize.
# Co-isolation of the IgG fraction of antilymphocyte serum which as ATGAM doubled the survival of human cadaveric renal allografts. His team leader, the pioneer of renal transplantation, Joseph E. Murray, MD was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1990.
# Co-covalent linkage of a cytotoxic agent to a protein carrier for the specific targeting of transplant rejection cells and cancer cells. As team leader, he consulted with 1966 Nobel Laureate Charles Huggins.
