{{Sociology}}

'''Medicalization''' is the process by which human conditions and problems come to be defined and treated as [[medical conditions]], and thus become the subject of medical study, diagnosis, [[Preventive medicine|prevention]], or treatment. Medicalization can be driven by new evidence or hypotheses about conditions; by changing social attitudes or economic considerations; or by the development of new medications or treatments.

Medicalization is studied from a [[sociology|sociologic perspective]] in terms of the role and power of professionals, patients, and corporations, and also for its implications for ordinary people whose self-identity and life decisions may depend on the prevailing concepts of health and illness. Once a condition is classified as medical, a [[medical model of disability]] tends to be used in place of a [[social model of disability|social model]]. Medicalization may also be termed "'''pathologization'''" or (pejoratively) "[[disease mongering]]".

==Development of the concept==
The concept of medicalization was devised by sociologists to explain how medical knowledge is applied to behaviors which are not self-evidently medical or biological.<ref name=White>{{cite book|last=White|first=Kevin|title=An introduction to the sociology of health and illness|year=2002|publisher=SAGE|isbn=0-7619-6400-2|pages=42|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5bHxQBNWGHMC&pg=PA42}}</ref> The term ''medicalization'' entered the sociology literature in the 1970s in the works of [[Irving Zola]], [[Peter Conrad (sociologist)|Peter Conrad]] and [[Thomas Szasz]], among others. These sociologists viewed medicalization as a form of social control in which medical authority expanded into domains of everyday existence, and they rejected medicalization in the name of liberation. This critique was embodied in works such as Conrad's "The discovery of hyperkinesis: notes on medicalization of deviance", published in 1973 ([[hyperkinesis]] was the term then used to describe what we might now call [[ADHD]]).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Conrad P |title=The discovery of hyperkinesis: notes on the medicalization of deviant behavior |journal=Soc Probl |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=12&ndash;21 |year=1975 |month=October |pmid=11662312 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

These sociologists did not believe medicalization to be a new phenomenon, arguing that medical authorities had always been concerned with social behavior and traditionally functioned as agents of social control (Foucault, 1965; Szasz,1970; Rosen). However, these authors took the view that increasingly sophisticated technology had extended the potential reach of medicalization as a form of social control, especially in terms of "psychotechnology" (Chorover,1973).

In the 1975 book ''Limits to medicine: Medical nemesis'' (1975), [[Ivan Illich]] put forth one of the earliest uses of the term "medicalization". Illich, a philosopher, argued that the medical profession harms people through [[iatrogenesis]], a process in which illness and social problems increase due to medical intervention. Illich saw iatrogenesis occurring on three levels: the ''clinical'', involving serious [[side effects]] worse than the original condition; the ''social'', whereby the general public is made docile and reliant on the medical profession to cope with life in their society; and the ''structural'', whereby the idea of aging and dying as medical illnesses effectively "medicalized" human life and left individuals and societies less able to deal with these "natural" processes.

The concept of medicalization dovetailed with some aspects of the 1970s [[feminist]] movement. Critics such as [[Barbara Ehrenreich|Ehrenreich]] and English (1978) argued that women's bodies were being medicalized by the predominantly male medical profession. Menstruation and pregnancy had come to be seen as medical problems requiring interventions such as [[hysterectomies]].

[[Marxist]]s such as Vicente Navarro (1980) linked medicalization to an oppressive [[capitalist]] society. They argued that medicine disguised the underlying causes of disease, such as [[social inequality]] and poverty, and instead presented health as an individual issue. Others{{Who|date=March 2012}} examined the power and prestige of the medical profession, including use of terminology to mystify and of professional rules to exclude or subordinate others.

== Professionals, patients, corporations and society ==

Several decades on, the definition of medicalization is complicated, if for no other reason than because the term is so widely used. Many contemporary critics position [[pharmaceutical companies]] in the space once held by doctors as the supposed [[catalysts]] of medicalization. Titles such as ''"The making of a disease"'' or ''"Sex, drugs, and marketing"'' critique the [[pharmaceutical industry]] for shunting everyday problems into the domain of professional [[biomedicine]]. At the same time, others reject as implausible any suggestion that society rejects [[drugs]] or [[drug companies]], and highlight that the same drugs that are allegedly used to treat [[deviance]]s from [[societal norms]] also help many people live their lives. Even scholars who critique the societal implications of brand-name drugs generally remain open to these drugs' curative effects — a far cry from earlier calls for a revolution against the biomedical establishment.  The emphasis in many quarters has come to be on "overmedicalization" rather than "medicalization" in itself.

Others, however, argue that in practice the process of medicalization tends to strip subjects of their social context, so they come to be understood in terms of the prevailing biomedical [[ideology]], resulting in a disregard for overarching social causes such as unequal distribution of power and resources.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15210098 | doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.01.003 | volume=59 | issue=6 | title=The medical text: between biomedicine and hegemony | year=2004 | month=September | author=Filc D | journal=Soc Sci Med | pages=1275–85}}</ref> A series of publications by [[Mens Sana Monographs]] have focused on medicine as a [[corporate]] capitalist enterprise.<ref>Ajai R Singh, Shakuntala A Singh, 2005, [http://www.msmonographs.org/article.asp?issn=0973-1229;year=2005;volume=3;issue=2;spage=19;epage=51;aulast=Singh "Medicine as a corporate enterprise, patient welfare centered profession, or patient welfare centered professional enterprise?"] Mens Sana Monographs, 3(2), p19-51</ref><ref>Ajai R Singh, Shakuntala A Singh, 2005, [http://www.msmonographs.org/article.asp?issn=0973-1229;year=2005;volume=3;issue=1;spage=5;epage=35;aulast=Singh "The connection between academia and industry"], Mens Sana Monographs, 3(1), p5-35</ref><ref>Ajai R Singh, Shakuntala A Singh, 2005, [http://www.msmonographs.org/article.asp?issn=0973-1229;year=2005;volume=3;issue=1;spage=41;epage=80;aulast=Singh "Public welfare agenda or corporate research agenda?"], Mens Sana Monographs, 3(1), p41-80.</ref>

The physician's role in this present-day notion of medicalization is similarly complex. On the one hand, the doctor remains an authority figure who [[prescribes]] [[pharmaceuticals]] to [[patient]]s. However, in some countries such as the US, ubiquitous [[direct-to-consumer advertising]] encourages patients to ask for particular drugs by name, thereby creating a conversation between consumer and drug company that threatens to cut the doctor out of the loop. And there is also widespread concern regarding the extent of the [[pharmaceutical marketing]] direct to doctors and other healthcare professionals, for example through visits by sales people, funding of journals, training courses or conferences, incentives for prescribing, and the routine provision of "information" written by the pharmaceutical company.

The role of patients in this economy has also changed. Once regarded as passive victims of medicalization, patients can now occupy active positions as [[advocates]], [[consumer]]s, or even agents of change.

The antithesis of medicalization is the process of [[paramedicalization]], where human conditions come under the attention of [[alternative medicine]], [[traditional medicine]] or any of numerous non-medical health approaches. Medicalization and paramedicalization can sometimes be contradictory and conflicting, but they also feed each other: they both ensure that questions of health and illness stay in sharp focus in defining human conditions and problems.

An editorial in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' warned of inappropriate medicalization leading to disease mongering, where the boundaries of the definition of illnesses are expanded to include personal problems as medical problems or risks of diseases are emphasized to broaden the market for medications. The authors noted "Inappropriate medicalisation carries the dangers of unnecessary labelling, poor treatment decisions, iatrogenic illness, and economic waste, as well as the opportunity costs that result when resources are diverted away from treating or preventing more serious disease. At a deeper level it may help to feed unhealthy obsessions with health, obscure or mystify sociological or political explanations for health problems, and focus undue attention on pharmacological, individualised, or privatised solutions."  Citing anecdotal case studies they were familiar with, the authors suggested further systematic research into this field to better understand the extent of influence this inappropriate medicalization has on public perception and the medical field.<ref name=Moynihan>{{cite journal|last1=Moynihan|first1=Ray|last2=Heath|first2=Iona|last3=Henry|first3=David|title=Selling sickness: the pharmaceutical industry and disease mongering|journal=[[BMJ]]|year=2002|month=13 April|volume=324(7342)|pages=886–891|pmid=11950740|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1122833|accessdate=22 March 2012|pmc=1122833|doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7342.886}}</ref>
