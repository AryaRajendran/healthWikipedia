'''Pelvic splanchnic nerves''' or '''nervi erigentes''' are [[splanchnic nerves]] that arise from sacral [[spinal nerve]]s [[sacral spinal nerve 2|S2]], [[sacral spinal nerve 3|S3]], [[sacral spinal nerve 4|S4]] to provide [[parasympathetic]] innervation to the [[hindgut]]. 

==Structure==
The pelvic splanchnic nerves arise from the ventral rami of the S2-S4 and enter the sacral plexus.  They travel to their side's corresponding [[inferior hypogastric plexus]], located bilaterally on the walls of the rectum.  

From there, they contribute to the innervation of the [[pelvis|pelvic]] and [[genital]] organs.  The nerves regulate the emptying of the [[urinary bladder]] and the [[rectum]] as well as [[sex]]ual functions like [[erection]].

They contain both [[preganglionic]] parasympathetic fibers as well as visceral afferent fibers.  

The [[parasympathetic nervous system]] is referred to as the ''craniosacral outflow''; the pelvic splanchnic nerves are the ''sacral'' component.  They are in the same region as the [[sacral splanchnic nerves]], which arise from the [[sympathetic trunk]] and provide sympathetic efferent fibers.  

The proximal 2/3 of the [[transverse colon]], and the rest of the proximal [[gastrointestinal tract]] is supplied its parasympathetic fibers by the [[vagus nerve]].  In the distal 1/3 of the transverse colon, and through the sigmoid and rectum, the pelvic splanchnic nerves take over.
