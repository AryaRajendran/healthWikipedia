{{mergefrom|Pain withdrawal reflex|date=April 2011}}
The '''withdrawal reflex''' ('''nociceptive''' or '''flexor withdrawal reflex''') is a [[spinal reflex]] intended to protect the body from damaging stimuli.<ref name="soscad">{{cite book |last1=Solomon |last2=Schmidt  |coauthors=Adragna |editor1-first=Field |editor1-last=Carol |title=Human Anatomy & physiology |type= |edition=2 |year=1990 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=0-03-011914-6 |page=470 |chapter=13}}</ref>  It is [[polysynaptic]], causing stimulation of sensory, association, and motor neurons.<ref name="soscad" />

==Example==
When a person touches a hot object and withdraws their hand from it without thinking about it, the heat stimulates [[Thermoreceptor|temperature]] and [[Nociceptor|danger receptors]] in the skin, triggering a sensory impulse that travels to the [[central nervous system]]. The sensory neuron then [[synapse]]s with [[interneuron]]s that connect to motor [[neuron]]s.<ref name="thpa">{{cite book |last1=Thibodeau |first1=Gary |last2=Patton |first2=Kevin  |editor1-first=Sally|editor1-last=Schrefer |title=Structure & Function of the Body |type= |edition=11 |year=2000 |publisher=Mosby, Inc |isbn=0-323-01082-2 |page=170 |chapter=7}}</ref> Some of these send motor impulses to the [[flexor]]s to allow withdrawal; some motor neurons send inhibitory impulses to the extensors so [[flexion]] is not inhibited - this is referred to as [[reciprocal innervation]].<ref name="sestta">{{cite book |last1=Seeley |first1=Rod |last2=Stephens |first2=Trent |coauthors=Philip Tate |editor1-first=Deborah |editor1-last=Allen |title=Anatomy and physiology |type= |edition=2 |year=1992 |publisher=Mosby-Year Book, Inc}}</ref>

==Crossed extension reflex following withdrawal reflex==
{{main|Crossed extensor reflex}}
Once a danger receptor (called 'nociceptor') has been stimulated, the signal travels via the sensory nerve to the posterior horn of the spinal cord. The nerve synapses with ipsilateral motor neurons that exit the anterior horn of the spinal cord and work to pull the injured body part away from danger within 0.5 seconds.<ref name="soscad" /> At the same time the sensory neuron synapses with the ipsilateral motor neuron, it also synapses with the motor neuron in the contralateral anterior horn.<ref name="sestta" /> This motor neuron stabilizes the uninjured side of the body (for instance, preparing the opposite leg to support the entire body weight when the other foot has stepped on a tack). At the same time as these two synapses, the sensory neuron also sends signals up the spinal cord to get motor neurons to contract muscles that shift the center of gravity of the body to maintain balance. This contralateral stimulation of motor neurons to stabilize the body is called the crossed extension reflex, and is a result of the withdrawal reflex (usually in the lower extremities).
