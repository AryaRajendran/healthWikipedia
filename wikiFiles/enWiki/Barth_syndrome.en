Barth syndrome is manifested in a variety of ways at birth. A majority of BTHS patients are hypotonic at birth, show signs of cardiomyopathy within the first few months of life, and experience a deceleration in growth in the first year, despite adequate nutrition. As patients progress into childhood, their height and weight lag significantly behind other children. While most patients express normal intelligence, a high proportion of BTHS patients also express mild or moderate learning disabilities. Physical activity is also hindered due to diminished muscular development and muscular hypotonia. Many of these disorders are resolved after puberty. Growth accelerates during puberty, and many patients reach a normal adult height.<ref>Kelley RI, [cited 6 Dec 2011]. “Barth Syndrome - X-linked Cardiomyopathy and Neutropenia”. Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. Available from: http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/cmsl/Barth_Summary.html</ref> 

Cardiomyopathy is one of the more severe manifestations of BTHS. The myocardium is dilated, reducing the systolic pump of the ventricles. For this reason, most BTHS patients have left myocardial thickening (hypertrophy). While cardiomyopathy can be life-threatening, it is commonly resolved or substantially improved in BTHS patients after puberty.<ref>Kelley RI, [cited 6 Dec 2011]. “Barth Syndrome - X-linked Cardiomyopathy and Neutropenia”. Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. Available from: http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/cmsl/Barth_Summary.html</ref>

[[Neutropenia]] is another deadly manifestation of BTHS. Neutropenia is a granulocyte disorder that results in a low production of neutrophils, the body’s primary defenders against bacterial infections. Surprisingly, however, BTHS patients have relatively fewer bacterial infections than other patients with neutropenia.<ref>Barth Syndrome Foundation, 28 Jun 2011. “Diagnosis of Barth Syndrome”.

==Incidence==
It has been documented in greater than 120 males to date (see Human Tafazzin (''TAZ'') Gene Mutation & Variation Database).<ref name=bs1357>http://barthsyndrome.org/english/View.asp?x=1357</ref> It is believed to be severely under-diagnosed<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cantlay AM, Shokrollahi K, Allen JT, Lunt PW, Newbury-Ecob RA, Steward CG |title=Genetic analysis of the G4.5 gene in families with suspected Barth syndrome |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |volume=135 |issue=3 |pages=311–5 |year=1999 |month=September |pmid=10484795 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(99)70126-5}}</ref> and may be estimated to occur in 1 out of approximately 300,000 births. Family members of the Barth Syndrome Foundation and its affiliates live in the US, Canada, the UK, Europe, Japan, South Africa, Kuwait, and Australia. 

To date, Barth syndrome is found exclusively in males.

==History==
The syndrome was named after Dr. Peter Barth (pediatric neurologist) (1932-) in the [[Netherlands]] for his research and discovery in 1983.<ref name=pmid6142097/> He described a [[pedigree chart]], showing that this is an inherited trait.

==Cause==
[[Mutations]] in the [[tafazzin]] [[gene]] (''TAZ'', also called G4.5) are closely associated with 
Barth syndrome. The tafazzin gene product is believed to function as an acyltransferase in complex lipid metabolism.<ref name=pmid14662265/><ref name=pmid11118295/> In 2008, Dr. Kulik found that all the BTHS individuals that he tested had abnormalities in their [[cardiolipin]] molecules, a lipid found inside the mitochondria of cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kulik W, van Lenthe H, Stet FS, ''et al.'' |title=Bloodspot assay using HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry for detection of Barth syndrome |journal=Clinical Chemistry |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=371–8 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18070816 |doi=10.1373/clinchem.2007.095711}}</ref> Cardiolipin is intimately connected with the [[electron transport chain]] proteins and the membrane structure of the mitochondria which is the energy producing organelle of the cell. The human tafazzin gene, NG_009634, is listed as over 10,000 base pairs in length and the full-length mRNA, NM_000116, is 1919 nucleotides long encoding 11 exons with a predicted protein length of 292 amino acids and a molecular weight of 33.5 kDa. The tafazzin gene is located at Xq28;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bione S, D'Adamo P, Maestrini E, Gedeon AK, Bolhuis PA, Toniolo D |title=A novel X-linked gene, G4.5. is responsible for Barth syndrome |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=385–9 |year=1996 |month=April |pmid=8630491 |doi=10.1038/ng0496-385}}</ref> the long arm of the X chromosome. Mutations in tafazzin that cause Barth syndrome span many different categories: missense, nonsense, deletion, frameshift, splicing (see Human Tafazzin (''TAZ'') Gene Mutation & Variation Database).<ref name=bs1357/>

[[iPLA2-VIA]] has been suggested as a target for treatment.<ref name="pmid19164547">{{cite journal |author=Malhotra A, Edelman-Novemsky I, Xu Y, ''et al.'' |title=Role of calcium-independent phospholipase A2 in the pathogenesis of Barth syndrome |journal=Proc.

== Barth Syndrome Foundation ==
The Barth Syndrome Foundation (BSF), together with its affiliates, are the only worldwide volunteer organizations dedicated to saving lives through education, advances in treatment, and finding a cure for Barth syndrome. The Barth Syndrome Foundation sponsors a competitive Research Grant Program and International Conferences for affected families, attending physicians, and scientists every two years.
