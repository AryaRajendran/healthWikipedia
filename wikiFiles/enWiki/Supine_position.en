The '''supine position''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|s|uː|p|aɪ|n}}) is a position of the [[human body|body]]: lying down with the [[face]] up, as opposed to the [[prone position]], which is face down, sometimes with the hands behind the head or neck. When used in surgical procedures, it allows access to the [[peritoneal]], [[thoracic]] and [[pericardium|pericardial]] regions; as well as the head, neck and extremities.<ref>Rothrock, J. C. (2007) ''Alexander's Care of the Patient in Surgery 13th Ed.'' Mobsy Elsevier: St Louis, Missouri. p. 148.</ref> 

Using terms defined in the [[anatomical position]], the dorsal side is down, and the ventral side is up.

== Semi-supine ==
In scientific literature "semi-supine" commonly refers to positions where the upper body is tilted (at 45° or variations) and not horizontal.<ref>Petropoulou, E; Lancellotti, P; Piérard, LA. (2006) "Quantitative analysis of semi-supine exercise echocardiography--influence of age on myocardial Doppler imaging indices." Acta Cardiol. 2006 Jun;61(3):271-7</ref> In the [[Alexander technique]] ''semi-supine'' position, the knees are raised bent upward while the soles of the feet and the upper body remain in contact with the horizontal surface.
