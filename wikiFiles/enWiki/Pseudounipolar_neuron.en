A '''pseudounipolar neuron''' (''pseudo'' - false, ''uni'' - one) is a [[sensory neuron|sensory]] [[neuron]] in the [[peripheral nervous system]]. This neuron contains an axon that has split into two branches; one branch runs to the periphery and the other to the spinal cord.<ref>Principles of neural science. Eric R. Kandel, James Schwartz, and Thomas Jessell. Fourth Edition. 2000</ref>

==Central and peripheral axons of a pseudounipolar neuron==
By definition, a pseudounipolar neuron has one axon with two branches: central and peripheral. These axonal branches should not be confused with dendrites. Pseudounipolar neurons do not have dendrites.<ref>http://htmlimg4.scribdassets.com/58p2i1eb43pry2o/images/31-d30ed6869f/000.jpg</ref> Each axon has a peripheral branch (from the cell body to the periphery: skin, joint and muscle) and a central branch (from the cell body to spinal cord).<ref>Principles of neural science. Eric R. Kandel, James Schwartz, and Thomas Jessell. Fourth Edition. 2000</ref>

==Anatomy==

The soma (cell body) of each pseudounipolar neuron is located within a [[dorsal root ganglion]]. The axon leaves the cell body (and out of the dorsal root ganglion) into the dorsal root, where it splits into two branches.  The central branch goes to the [[posterior horn of spinal cord|posterior (dorsal) horn]] of the spinal cord, where it forms [[synapse]]s with other neurons. The peripheral branch travels through the distal [[dorsal root]] into the spinal nerve all the way until skin, joint, and muscle.

==Signal Pathway==

These neurons have sensory receptors on skin, joints, muscles, and other parts of the body.  The signal is conducted through the axon to the dorsal root ganglion's cell body, then through the axon and ending at the sensory nuclei in the posterior horn of the spinal cord.
