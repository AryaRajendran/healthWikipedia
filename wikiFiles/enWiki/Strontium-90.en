'''Strontium-90''' ('''{{SimpleNuclide2|strontium|90}}''') is a [[radioactive]] [[isotope]] of [[strontium]] produced by [[nuclear fission]] with a [[half-life]] of 28.8 years. It undergoes [[beta decay|β<sup>−</sup> decay]] into [[yttrium-90]], with a decay energy of 0.546&nbsp;MeV.<ref name="hyperphysics">{{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/fisfrag.html#c5 |title=Nuclear Fission Fragments |accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref> Strontium-90 has applications in medicine and industry and is an isotope of concern in [[nuclear fallout|fallout]] from [[nuclear weapons]] and [[nuclear accidents]].<ref name="EPA">{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/rpdweb00/radionuclides/strontium.html#environment |title=Strontium &#124; Radiation Protection &#124; US EPA |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] |date=24 April 2012 |accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref>

==Radioactivity==
Natural strontium is nonradioactive and nontoxic, but <sup>90</sup>Sr is a radioactivity hazard.  <sup>90</sup>Sr undergoes [[beta decay|β<sup>−</sup> decay]] with a [[half-life]] of 28.79 years and a [[decay energy]] of 0.546 [[electronvolt|MeV]] distributed to an [[electron]], an anti-neutrino, and the [[yttrium]] isotope '''[[isotopes of yttrium#90|<sup>90</sup>Y]]''', which in turn undergoes [[beta decay|β<sup>−</sup> decay]] with half-life of 64 hours and decay energy 2.28 MeV distributed to an electron, an anti-neutrino, and [[zirconium|<sup>90</sup>Zr]] (zirconium), which is stable.<ref>Decay data from [http://www.nndc.bnl.gov National Nuclear Data Center] at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the US.</ref> Note that <sup>90</sup>Sr/Y is almost a perfectly pure [[beta particle|beta]] source; the [[gamma photon]] emission from the decay of <sup>90</sup>Y is so infrequent that it can normally be ignored.

{{Medium-lived fission products}}

==Fission product==
<sup>90</sup>Sr is a product of [[nuclear fission]]. It is present in significant amount in [[spent nuclear fuel]] and in [[radioactive waste]] from [[nuclear reactor]]s and in [[nuclear fallout]] from [[nuclear test]]s.
For [[thermal neutron]] fission as in today's nuclear power plants, the [[fission product yield]] from [[Uranium-235|U-235]] is 5.8%, from [[Uranium-233|U-233]] 6.8%, but from [[Pu-239]] only 2.1%.

==Biological Effects==

===Biological Activity===
Strontium-90 is a "[[bone seeker]]" that exhibits biochemical behavior similar to [[calcium]], the next lighter [[group 2 element]]. After entering the organism, most often by ingestion with contaminated food or water, about 70–80% of the dose gets excreted. Virtually all remaining strontium-90 is deposited in [[bone]]s and [[bone marrow]], with the remaining 1% remaining in blood and soft tissues. Its presence in bones can cause [[bone cancer]], cancer of nearby tissues, and [[leukemia]]. Exposure to <sup>90</sup>Sr can be tested by a [[bioassay]], most commonly by [[urinalysis]].  Strontium-90 is probably the most dangerous component of the radioactive fallout from a [[nuclear weapon]].

The [[biological half life]] of Strontium-90 in Humans has variously been reported as from 14 to 600 days,<ref>http://hanford-site.pnnl.gov/envreport/2001/env01_45.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10136486-6sLptZ/native/10136486.pdf</ref> 1000 days,<ref>http://www.areaivenvirothon.org/freshwaterecology.htm</ref> 18 years,<ref>http://www.epi.alaska.gov/eh/radiation/RadioisotopesInFood.pdf</ref> 30 years<ref>http://www.gsseser.com/FactSheet/Strontium.pdf</ref> and finally at an upper limit, 49 years.<ref>http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nuclear/biohalf.html</ref> The wide ranging published biological half life figures are explained by the isotope's complex metabolism within the body, but by averaging over all excretion paths the biological half life is about 18 years.<ref>http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/effects/eonw_12.pdf#zoom=100 Glasstone and Dolan The effects of Nuclear Weapons 1977 page 605</ref>

Together with the caesium isotopes [[caesium|<sup>134</sup>Cs]], [[caesium-137|<sup>137</sup>Cs]], and iodine isotope [[iodine-131|<sup>131</sup>I]] it was among the most important isotopes regarding health impacts after the [[Chernobyl disaster]].
As strontium has an affinity to the [[calcium-sensing receptor]] of [[parathyroid]] [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s that is similar to that of calcium, the increased risk of [[Liquidator (Chernobyl)|liquidator]]s of the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] power plant to suffer from [[primary hyperparathyroidism]] could be explained by binding of strontium-90.<ref name=BoehmNEJM>{{cite journal|last=Boehm|first=Bernhard O.|coauthors=Rosinger, Silke, Belyi, David, Dietrich, Johannes W.|title=The Parathyroid as a Target for Radiation Damage|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|year=2011|month=08|volume=365|issue=7|pages=676–678|doi=10.1056/NEJMc1104982|pmid=21848480|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1104982|accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>

===Medical Applications===
<sup>90</sup>Sr finds extensive use in medicine as a radioactive source for superficial [[radiotherapy]] of some cancers. Controlled amounts of <sup>90</sup>Sr and [[strontium-89|<sup>89</sup>Sr]] can be used in treatment of [[bone cancer]]. It is also used as a [[radioactive tracer]] in medicine and agriculture.

===<sup>90</sup>Sr in Fallout===
Strontium-90 is not quite as likely as caesium-137 to be released as a part of a nuclear reactor accident because it is much less volatile, but is probably the most dangerous component of the radioactive fallout from a nuclear weapon.<ref name="hyperphysics" /> 

A study of hundreds of thousands of [[deciduous teeth]], collected by Dr. [[Louise Reiss]] and her colleagues as part of the [[Baby Tooth Survey]], found a large increase in <sup>90</sup>Sr levels through the 1950s and early 1960s.  The study's final results showed that children born in 1963 had levels of <sup>90</sup>Sr in their deciduous teeth that was 50 times higher than that found in children born in 1950, before the advent of large-scale atomic testing. Commentators on the study said that the fallout was likely to cause increased cases of diseases in those who absorb Strontium-90 into their bones.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schneir|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Schneir|title=Strontium-90 in U.S. Children|journal=[[The Nation]]|date=April 25, 1959|volume=188|issue=17|pages=355–357}}</ref> 

An article with the study's initial findings was circulated to U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1961, and helped convince him to sign the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] with the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Soviet Union]], ending the above-ground [[nuclear weapons testing]] that placed the greatest amounts of [[nuclear fallout]] into the atmosphere.<ref name=Reiss>Hevesi, Dennis. [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/science/10reiss.html "Dr. Louise Reiss, Who Helped Ban Atomic Testing, Dies at 90"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 10, 2011. Accessed January 10, 2011.</ref>

==Industrial and Aerospace Applications==
<sup>90</sup>Sr finds use in industry as a radioactive source for thickness gauges.

===Heat source for RTGs===
The radioactive decay of strontium-90 generates significant amount of heat (0.921 W/g) of the isotope or approximately 0.536 W/g of the compound.<ref>[Properties of
Selected Radioisotopes http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19680020487_1968020487.pdf]</ref> and is cheaper than the alternative [[plutonium-238|<sup>238</sup>Pu]]. It is used as a heat source in many Russian/Soviet [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s, usually in the form of [[strontium fluoride]]. It was also used in the US Sentinel series of RTGs in the form of [[strontium titanate]].<ref name=OTA94>{{cite web |title = Power Sources for Remote Arctic Applications

===Dispersal hazards===
Accidental mixing of radioactive sources containing strontium with metal scrap can result in production of radioactive steel. Discarded radioisotope thermoelectric generators are a major source of <sup>90</sup>Sr contamination in the area of the former Soviet Union.
