In [[human anatomy]], the '''axillary artery''' is a large [[blood vessel]] that conveys oxygenated [[blood]] to the lateral aspect of the [[thorax]], the [[axilla]] (armpit) and the [[upper limb]].  Its origin is at the lateral margin of the first [[rib]], before which it is called the [[subclavian artery]].  

After passing the lower margin of [[teres major muscle|teres major]] it becomes the [[brachial artery]].  

==Relation to pectoralis minor: division into three parts==
The axillary artery is often referred to as having three parts, with these divisions based on its location relative to the [[Pectoralis minor]] muscle, which is superficial to the artery.  
* First part - the part of the artery medial to pectoralis minor
* Second part - the part of the artery that lies behind pectoralis minor
* Third part - the part of the artery lateral to pectoralis minor

==Relation to nerves and vein==
The axillary artery is accompanied by the [[axillary vein]] along its length.  

In the axilla, it is surrounded by the [[brachial plexus]]. The second part of the axillary artery is the reference for the locational descriptions of the cords in the [[brachial plexus]].  For example, the [[posterior cord]] of the brachial plexus is so named because it lies posterior to the second part of the artery.  

==Branches==
[[Image:Axillary branches.PNG|thumb|right|350px|Branches of axillary artery]]

The axillary artery has several smaller branches. The branches can be remembered, in order, when traveling from the heart, with the [[mnemonic]] "Screw The Lawyers Save A Patient", "Summertime: The Lakers Schedule Another Parade", or "She Tastes Like Sweet Apple Pie." <ref>{{MedicalMnemonics|1208|852|663|}}</ref>  The origin of these branches is highly variable (e.g. the posterior and anterior circumflex arteries often have a common trunk). An arterial branch is named for its course, not its origin.

* First part (1 branch)
** [[Superior thoracic artery|'''S'''uperior thoracic artery]] (Supreme thoracic artery)
* Second part (2 branches)
** [[Thoraco-acromial artery|'''T'''horaco-acromial artery]]
** [[Lateral thoracic artery|'''L'''ateral thoracic artery]].  If the lateral thoracic artery is not branching from the axillary artery, will most likely branch from the following (in order of likelihood): (1) thoracoacrominal, (2) third part of axillary artery, (3) suprascapular artery, (4) subscapular artery
* Third part (3 branches)
** [[Subscapular artery|'''S'''ubscapular artery]]
** [[Anterior circumflex humeral artery|'''A'''nterior humeral circumflex artery]]
** [[Posterior humeral circumflex artery|'''P'''osterior humeral circumflex artery]]

Continues as the [[brachial artery]] past the inferior border of the [[teres major]].

==Clinical Significance==

The axillary artery may be safely clamped without endangering the arm, but only in a location proximal to the origin of the subscapular artery. The anastomotic network surrounding the scapula provides an alternate path for collateral circulation to the arm from arteries including the [[dorsal scapular artery]] and [[suprascapular artery]].

The right axillary artery is often used as an arterial [[cannula|cannulation]] site in [[cardiac surgery]], particularly for repair of [[aortic dissection]] and replacement of the [[ascending aorta]] and [[aortic arch]].
