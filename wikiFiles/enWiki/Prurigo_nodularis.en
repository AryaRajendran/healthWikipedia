'''Prurigo nodularis''' (PN) is a [[skin disease]] characterised by pruritic ([[itch]]y) nodules which usually appear on the arms or legs. Patients often present with multiple [[excoriation|excoriated]] lesions caused by scratching. PN is also known as Hyde prurigo nodularis, ''Picker's nodules'', atypical nodular form of neurodermatitis circumscripta, lichen corneus obtusus. 

[[Lichen simplex chronicus]] is a distinct clinical entity.

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[Image:Prurigo nodularis.jpg|thumb|Pruritic [[papules]] and scattered nodules can be seen (a) on the legs, (b) on the arms and (c) on the trunk of this patient with prurigo nodularis.]]
*Nodules are discrete, generally symmetric, hyperpigmented or [[purpuric]], and firm. They are greater than 0.5&nbsp;cm in both width and depth (as opposed to [[papules]] which are less than 0.5&nbsp;cm). They can appear on any part of the body, but generally begin on the arms and legs.
*Excoriated lesions are often flat, umbilicated, or have a crusted top.
*Nodules may appear to begin in the hair follicles.
*Nodule pattern may be follicular.
*In true [[prurigo nodularis]], a nodule forms before any itching begins. Typically, these nodules are extremely pruritic and are alleviated only by steroids.

==Causes==
The cause of prurigo nodularis is unknown, although other conditions may induce PN.

== Pathophysiology ==
[[Habit (psychology)|Chronic]] and repetitive scratching, picking, or rubbing of the nodules may result in permanent changes to the skin, including nodular lichenification, hyperkeratosis, hyperpigmentation, and skin thickening. Unhealed, excoriated lesions are often scaly, crusted or scabbed. Many patients report a lack of wound healing even when medications relieve the itching and subsequent scratching.

Patients often:
* seek treatment during middle-age, although PN can occur at any age.
* have a history of chronic severe pruritus.
* have a significant medical history for unrelated conditions.
* suffer from liver or kidney dysfunctions.
* suffer secondary skin infections.
* have a personal or family history of [[atopic dermatitis]].
* have other autoimmune disorders.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is based on visual examination and the presence of itching. A skin biopsy is often performed to exclude other diseases. Lesion biopsies will typically show a high level of [[Eosinophil granulocyte|eosinophils]] in PN.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Johansson O, Liang Y, Marcusson JA, Reimert CM |title=Eosinophil cationic protein- and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin/eosinophil protein X-immunoreactive eosinophils in prurigo nodularis |journal=Arch.

== Treatment ==
Prurigo nodularis is very hard to treat, but current therapies include steroids, vitamins, [[cryosurgery]], [[thalidomide]] and [[light therapy|UVB light]]. In the event that staphylococcus or other infection is present, antibiotics have proven effective. In at least one case, the root cause of PN was MRSA which was treated with intravenous vancomycin, affecting a complete cure(paper in progress; treat as anecdotal).
A physician may administer a strong dose of [[prednisone]], which will almost immediately stop the itch/scratch cycle. However, cessation of steroids allows relapse to occur, usually within a few weeks. Horiuchi et al. recently reported significant improvement in PN with antibiotic therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Horiuchi Y, Bae S, Katayama I |title=Uncontrollable prurigo nodularis effectively treated by roxithromycin and tranilast |journal=Journal of drugs in dermatology : JDD |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=363–5 |year=2006 |pmid=16673805 |doi=}}</ref>

== History ==
Prurigo nodularis was first described by Hyde and Montgomery in 1909.<ref>Hyde JN, Montgomery FH: A practical treatise on disease of the skin for the use of students and practitioners. 1909; 174–175.</ref>
