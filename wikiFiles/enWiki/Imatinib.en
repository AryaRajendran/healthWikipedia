'''Imatinib''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), marketed by [[Novartis]] as '''Gleevec''' (U.S.) or '''Glivec''' (Europe/Australia/Latin America), is a [[tyrosine-kinase inhibitor]] used in the treatment of multiple cancers, most notably [[Philadelphia chromosome]]-positive (Ph<sup>+</sup>) [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] (CML).<ref>Novartis Pharma AG. Gleevec® (imatinib mesylate) tablets prescribing information. East Hanover, NJ; 2006 Sep. Anon. Drugs of choice for cancer. Treat Guidel Med Lett. 2003; 1:41–52</ref> Like all tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, imatinib works by preventing a tyrosine kinase enzyme, in this case [[Bcr-Abl|BCR-Abl]], from [[phosphorylation|phosphorylating]] subsequent proteins and initiating the signaling cascade necessary for cancer development, thus preventing the growth of cancer cells and leading to their death by [[apoptosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Goldman |first=J.

Imatinib has been cited as the first of the gratuitously expensive cancer drugs, costing $92,000 a year. Doctors and patients complain that this is excessive, given that its development costs have been recovered many times over, and that the costs of synthesizing the drug are orders of magnitude lower. In the USA, the patent protecting the active principal will expire on 4 January 2015 while the patent protecting the beta crystal form of the active principal ingredient will expire on 23 May 2019.<ref name="Novartis fails to patent Glivec (Gleevec) in India">{{cite web|title=Novartis fails to patent Glivec (Gleevec) in India|url=http://cambridgeip.com/component/content/article/52-blog/705-novartis-fails-to-patent-glivec-gleevec-in-india.html}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Imatinib is used in [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] (CML), [[gastrointestinal stromal tumor]]s (GISTs) and a number of other [[malignancy|malignancies]]. One study demonstrated that imatinib mesylate was effective in patients with systemic [[mastocytosis]], including those who had the D816V mutation in c-Kit.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Droogendijk HJ, Kluin-Nelemans HJ, van Doormaal JJ, Oranje AP, van de Loosdrecht AA, van Daele PL |title=Imatinib mesylate in the treatment of systemic mastocytosis: a phase II trial |journal=Cancer |volume=107 |issue=2 |pages=345–51 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16779792 |doi=10.1002/cncr.21996 |url=}}</ref> Experience has shown, however, that imatinib is much less effective in patients with this mutation, and patients with the mutation comprise nearly 90% of cases of mastocytosis.

===Chronic myelogenous leukemia===
The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has approved imatinib as first-line treatment for [[Philadelphia chromosome]] (Ph)-positive CML, both in adults and children.

''[[In vitro]]'' studies identified that a modified version of imatinib can bind to [[gamma-secretase]] activating protein ([[GSAP]]), which selectively increases the production and accumulation of neurotoxic [[beta-amyloid]] plaques.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacokinetics===
Imatinib is rapidly absorbed when given by mouth, and is highly [[bioavailability|bioavailable]]: 98% of an oral dose reaches the bloodstream. Metabolism of imatinib occurs in the [[liver]] and is mediated by several [[isozyme]]s of the [[cytochrome P450]] system, including [[CYP3A4]] and, to a lesser extent, [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP2D6]], [[CYP2C9]], and [[CYP2C19]]. The main [[metabolite]], ''N''-demethylated [[piperazine]] derivative, is also active. The major route of elimination is in the bile and feces; only a small portion of the drug is excreted in the urine. Most of imatinib is eliminated as metabolites, only 25% is eliminated unchanged. The [[half-life|half-lives]] of imatinib and its main metabolite are 18 and 40 hours, respectively. It blocks the activity of Abelson cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (ABL), c-Kit and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). As an inhibitor of PDGFR, imatinib mesylate appears to have utility in the treatment of a variety of dermatological diseases. Imatinib has been reported to be an effective treatment for FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha+ mast cell disease, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Scheinfeld N, Schienfeld N |title=A comprehensive review of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) for dermatological diseases |journal=J Drugs Dermatol |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=117–22 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16485879 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Mechanism of action===
[[Image:Mechanism imatinib.svg|right|Mechanism of action of imatinib]]
Imatinib is a 2-[[phenyl]] [[amino]] [[pyrimidine]] derivative that functions as a specific inhibitor of a number of tyrosine kinase enzymes. It occupies the ''TK'' active site, leading to a decrease in activity.

There are a large number of ''TK'' enzymes in the body, including the [[insulin receptor]]. Imatinib is specific for the ''TK'' domain in ''[[Philadelphia chromosome|abl]]'' (the Abelson proto-oncogene), [[c-kit]] and [[PDGF-R]] ([[platelet-derived growth factor]] receptor).

In [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]], the [[Philadelphia chromosome]] leads to a fusion protein of ''abl'' with ''bcr'' (''breakpoint cluster region''), termed ''bcr-abl''. As this is now a [[wikt:constitutive|constitutively active]] [[tyrosine kinase]], imatinib is used to decrease ''bcr-abl'' activity.

The [[active site]]s of tyrosine kinases each have a [[binding site]] for [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. The enzymatic activity [[Catalysis|catalyzed]] by a tyrosine kinase is the transfer of the terminal [[phosphate]] from ATP to [[tyrosine]] residues on its [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]], a process known as protein tyrosine [[phosphorylation]]. Imatinib works by binding close to the ATP binding site of ''bcr-abl'', locking it in a closed or self-inhibited conformation, and therefore inhibiting the enzyme activity of the protein [[enzyme inhibitor|semi-competitively]].<ref>Takimoto CH, Calvo E. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter03/article/10165/1402628 "Principles of Oncologic Pharmacotherapy"] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.</ref> This fact explains why many BCR-ABL mutations can cause resistance to imatinib by shifting its equilibrium toward the open or active conformation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gambacorti-Passerini CB, Gunby RH, Piazza R, Galietta A, Rostagno R, Scapozza L |title=Molecular mechanisms of resistance to imatinib in Philadelphia-chromosome-positive leukaemias |journal=Lancet Oncol. |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=75–85 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12573349 |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(03)00979-3  |url=}}</ref>

Imatinib is quite selective for ''bcr-abl'' – it does also inhibit other targets mentioned above (c-kit and PDGF-R), but no other known [[tyrosine kinase]]s. Imatinib also inhibits the ''abl'' protein of non-cancer cells but cells normally have additional redundant tyrosine kinases which allow them to continue to function even if ''abl'' tyrosine kinase is inhibited. Some [[Cancer cell|tumor cells]], however, have a dependence on ''bcr-abl''.<ref name="DeiningerDruker">{{cite journal |author=Deininger MW, Druker BJ |title=Specific targeted therapy of chronic myelogenous leukemia with imatinib |journal=Pharmacol. Rev. |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=401–23 |year=2003 |month=September |pmid=12869662 |doi=10.1124/pr.55.3.4 |url=}}</ref> Inhibition of the ''bcr-abl'' tyrosine kinase also stimulates its entry in to the nucleus, where it is unable to perform any of its normal anti-[[apoptosis|apoptopic]] functions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vigneri P, Wang JY |title=Induction of apoptosis in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells through nuclear entrapment of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase |journal=Nat.

The Bcr-Abl pathway has many downstream pathways including the Ras/MapK pathway, which leads to increased proliferation due to increased growth factor-independent cell growth. It also affects the Src/Pax/Fak/Rac pathway. This affects the cytoskeleton, which leads to increased cell motility and decreased adhesion. The PI/PI3K/AKT/BCL-2 pathway is also affected. BCL-2 is responsible for keeping the mitochondria stable; this suppresses cell death by apoptosis and increases survival. The last pathway that Bcr-Abl affects is the JAK/STAT pathway, which is responsible for proliferation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weisberg|first=Ellen|coauthors=Paul W. Manley, Sandra W. Cowan-Jacob, Andreas Hochhaus, and James Griffin|title=Second Generation Inhibitors of BCR-ABL for the Treatment of Imatinib-resistant Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia.|journal=Nature Reviews Cancer 7|year=2007|pages=345–56|doi=10.1038/nrc2126|volume=7|issue=5}}</ref>

==Interactions==
Since imatinib is mainly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4, substances influencing the activity of this enzyme change the plasma concentration of the drug. An example of a drug that increases imatinib activity and therefore side effects by blocking CYP3A4 is [[ketoconazole]]. The same could be true of [[itraconazole]], [[clarithromycin]], [[grapefruit juice]], among others. Conversely, CYP3A4 inductors like [[rifampicin]] and [[St. John's Wort]] reduce the drug's activity, risking therapy failure. Imatinib also acts as an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 2C9 and 2D6, increasing the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs like [[simvastatin]], [[ciclosporin]], [[pimozide]], [[warfarin]], [[metoprolol]], and possibly [[paracetamol]]. The drug also reduces plasma levels of [[levothyroxin]] via an unknown mechanism.<ref name="AustriaCodex" />

As with other immunosuppressants, application of [[live vaccine]]s is contraindicated because the microorganisms in the vaccine could multiply and infect the patient. [[Inactivated vaccine|Inactivated]] and [[toxoid]] vaccines do not hold this risk, but may not be effective under imatinib therapy.<ref name="Arzneimittel-Interaktionen">{{cite book|title=Arzneimittel-Interaktionen|editor=Klopp, T|publisher=Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Pharmazeutische Information|year=2010|edition=2010/2011|isbn=978-3-85200-207-1|language=German}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Time cover on Glivec 28 May 2001.png|thumb|200px|right]]
Imatinib was developed in the late 1990s by biochemist [[Nicholas Lydon]], a former researcher for Novartis, and oncologist [[Brian Druker]] of [[Oregon Health & Science University]] (OHSU). Other major contributions to imatinib development were made by [[Carlo Gambacorti-Passerini]], a physician scientist and hematologist at [[University of Milano Bicocca]], Italy, John Goldman at [[Hammersmith Hospital]] in London, UK, and later on by [[Charles Sawyers]] of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.<ref name=nyt>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/science/03conv.html A Conversation With Brian J. Druker, M.D., Researcher Behind the Drug Gleevec] by [[Claudia Dreifus]], ''The New York Times'', 2 November 2009</ref> Druker led the clinical trials confirming its efficacy in [[chronic myelogenous leukemia|CML]].<ref>{{cite journal |author =Gambacorti-Passerini C |title=Part I: Milestones in personalised medicine—imatinib |journal=Lancet Oncology|year=2008 |page =600|volume=9|issue=600|pmid=18510992|doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(08)70152-9}}</ref>

Imatinib was developed by [[rational drug design]]. After the [[Philadelphia chromosome]] mutation and hyperactive ''bcr-abl'' protein were discovered, the investigators screened chemical libraries to find a drug that would inhibit that protein. With [[high-throughput screening]], they identified 2-[[phenylaminopyrimidine]]. This [[lead compound]] was then tested and modified by the introduction of methyl and [[benzamide]] groups to give it enhanced binding properties, resulting in imatinib.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Druker BJ, Lydon NB |title=Lessons learned from the development of an abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor for chronic myelogenous leukemia |journal=J.

Gleevec received FDA approval in May 2001. On the same month it made the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine as the "magic bullet" to cure cancer. Druker, Lydon and Sawyers received the [[Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award]] in 2009 for "converting a fatal cancer into a manageable chronic condition".<ref name=nyt/>

Gleevec also holds the record for the drug with the fastest approval time by the FDA. According to Brian Druker, one of the developers of Imatinib, the biggest obstacle to being approved was the name of the drug. At that time, the drug was being called "Glivec", which is also the current spelling in most parts of the world. However, the United States Food and Drug Administration did not want people to mispronounce "Glivec" as "GLIE-VEC" which could be confused with a diabetic drug at the time. Therefore, Novartis, the pharmaceutical company who markets Gleevec, changed the name of "Glivec" to include two "e's" and avoid the phonetic confusion: Gleevec.  Shortly thereafter, Gleevec was approved by the FDA.

In 2013, more than 100 cancer specialists published a letter in ''Blood'' saying that the prices of many new cancer drugs, including imatinib, is so high that U.S. patients couldn't afford them, and that the level of prices, and profits, was so high as to be immoral. Signatories of the letter included Brian Drucker, Carlo Gambacorti-Asserini, and John Goldman, developers of imatinib. In 2001, imatinib was priced at $30,000 a year, which was based on the price of interferon, then the standard treatment, and would have recouped the development costs in 2 years. After unexpectedly becoming a blockbuster, its price was increased to $92,000 per year in 2012, with annual revenues of $4.7 billion. All its research and development costs were covered in the first $1 billion, and everything else was profit.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/business/cancer-physicians-attack-high-drug-costs.html Doctors Denounce Cancer Drug Prices of $100,000 a Year] By ANDREW POLLACK, New York Times, April 25, 2013</ref><ref>[http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/early/2013/04/23/blood-2013-03-490003.full.pdf Price of drugs for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), reflection of the unsustainable cancer drug prices: perspective of CML Experts] Experts in chronic myeloid leukemia, Blood, Published online before print April 25, 2013, doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-03-490003</ref> Other doctors have complained about the cost.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schiffer CA |title=BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors for chronic myelogenous leukemia |journal=N.

===Legal challenge to generics===
{{Main|Novartis v. Union of India & Others}}
The [[active pharmaceutical ingredient]] of Glivec/Gleevec is a specific chemical form of imatinib, namely, the [[Conformational polymorphism|beta polymorph]] of imatinib [[mesylate]], which exhibits greater stability and bioavailability than the ''alpha'' polymorph. A patent for the [[free base]] of imatinib was first granted in 1996; Novartis later filed and obtained separate patents for the specific formulation used as the active ingredient of Glivec/Gleevec in several countries.<ref name=Basheer/> In India, however, such a patent application was rejected in 2005 for a variety of reasons, including lack of [[novelty (patent)|novelty]] and lack of enhanced [[efficacy]]; under Section 3(d) of the [[Indian Patent Act]], alternative forms of a chemical compound (including its [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], [[isomer]]s and [[Conformational polymorphism|crystal polymorphs]]) are not eligible for patent protection unless they exhibit a difference in efficacy as compared with the parent compound.<ref name=Basheer>{{cite journal |author=Basheer S, Reddy P |title='Ducking' TRIPS in India: A Saga Involving Novartis and the Legality of Section 3(d) |year=2008 |journal=National Law School of India Review |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=131&ndash;55 |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1329201}}</ref>

In 2007, this rejection of the imatinib patent claim became a [[test case (law)|test case]] through which Novartis challenged [[India|India's]] patent laws. A win for Novartis would make it harder for Indian companies to produce [[generic drugs|generic versions of drugs]] still manufactured under patent elsewhere in the world. [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders]] argues a change in law would make it impossible for Indian companies to produce cheap generic antiretrovirals (anti-HIV medication), thus making it impossible for developing countries to buy these [[essential medicines]].<ref>[[Médecins Sans Frontières]]. ''[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=1870 "As Novartis Challenges India's Patent Law, MSF Warns Access to Medicines Is Under Threat"]'', 2006-09-26. Accessed 2013-04-04.</ref> On 6 August 2007, the [[Madras High Court]] dismissed the writ petition filed by Novartis challenging the constitutionality of Section 3(d) of [[Indian Patent Act]], and deferred to the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) forum to resolve the [[TRIPS]] compliance question. In 2009 Novartis filed a case with the [[Supreme Court of India]] challenging the patent denial and the Section 3(d) of Indian Patent Act on the basis that it defined innovation too narrowly. On 1 April 2013, Novartis lost the case.<ref name="Novartis fails to patent Glivec (Gleevec) in India"/>  The court cited that the chemical form of imatinib that Novartis wanted to repatent in India is not significantly different from imatinib free base, which had patents that have already expired; hence, Novartis' claim to the patent was considered invalid, as there was no change in efficacy with the new compound that Novartis was trying to patent. This process of repatenting modified formulations of a drug after the original composition of matter patent has expired is an example of [[evergreening]], which is prohibited under Indian patent law. Novartis responded by indicating that it will continue to refrain from research and development activities in India.<ref>Kaustubh Kulkarni and Suchitra Mohanty.
