The '''Association of American Cancer Institutes''' ('''AACI''') is a membership association of 95 academic and freestanding [[cancer]] research centers in the [[United States]].  AACI's membership roster consists of [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI)-designated centers and academic-based cancer research programs that receive [[National Institute of Health]] (NIH) and NCI support.

The association is headquartered in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. AACI cancer centers serve as the headquarters for most of the NCI sponsored clinical trials. 

In addition to providing their local populations ready access to a wide array of cancer specialists&mdash;multidisciplinary experts in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and cancer care&mdash;AACI cancer centers have developed partnerships with local community and state health agencies to design and implement programs aimed at reducing the overall cancer burden of the region.
