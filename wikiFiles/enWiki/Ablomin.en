'''Ablomin''' is a [[toxin]] present in the venom of the [[Japanese Mamushi]] snake, which blocks L-type voltage-gated calcium channels.

== Etymology ==
The protein ablomin is a component of the venom of the Japanese [[Mamushi]] snake, ''[[Gloydius blomhoffi]]''. The term ‘ablomin’ is an acronym derived from ''[[Agkistrodon]] blomhoffi'', an old name for this snake.

== Source ==
The protein can be found in the venom of the [[Japanese Mamushi]] snake, a member of the [[Viperidae]] family.

== Chemistry ==
Ablomin is part of the [[Cysteine-rich secretory protein|Cystein-Rich Secretory Protein]] (CRISP) family. CRISPs comprise a particular group of snake venom proteins distributed among the venom of several families of snakes, such as [[elapids]], [[colubrids]] and [[Viperidae|vipers]].

The protein exists of 240 [[amino acids]], coded by an [[mRNA]] of 1336 [[base pairs]].<ref name=one /> Structurally, it is composed of three distinct regions: an N-terminal protein domain, a hinge region and a C-terminal cystein-rich domain.<ref name=two /> It has a [[molecular mass]] of 25 [[kDa]].

Ablomin shows great sequence [[Homology (biology)|homology]] with [[triflin]] (83.7%) and [[latisemin]] (61.5%), two other snake venom components of the CRISP family, which also target voltage-dependent calcium channels. In addition, it shows partial homology with helothermine (52.8%), a venom protein of the Mexican beaded lizard; this protein, however, targets other ion channels than ablomin.<ref name=one />

== Target ==
Ablomin reduces potassium-induced contraction of smooth muscles, suggesting that it blocks [[L-type voltage-gated calcium channel]]s.<ref name=three /> Moreover, ablomin may slightly inhibit rod-type [[cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel]]s ([[Cyclic nucleotide-gated channel alpha 1|CNGA1]]) channels.<ref name=three />

== Toxicity ==
Ablomin affects high potassium-induced contraction of arterial smooth muscle in rat-tails in a concentration-dependent matter. Reduction of arterial smooth muscle contraction in a rat-tail results in vasodilation of the rat-tails artery, which may lead to hypothermia.<ref name=one /> Blocking other L-type voltage gated Ca2+ channels, for instance in the heart, may lead to arrhythmias and even cardiac arrest.
