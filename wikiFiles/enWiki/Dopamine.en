'''Dopamine''' (abbreviated as '''DA'''<ref>{{cite book|author=Ian P. Stolerman|title=Encyclopedia of Psychopharmacology, Volume 2 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qoyYobgX0uwC&pg=PA212&dq=Dopamine+DA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3tXaT5uWJoSC2wXoivW-CA&ved=0CEQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Dopamine%20DA&f=false|date=2 August 2010|publisher=[[Springer Publishing]]|isbn=3-540-68698-3}}</ref>), a simple organic chemical in the [[catecholamine]] family, is a [[monoamine neurotransmitter]] and [[hormone]], which has a number of important physiological roles in the bodies of animals. In addition to being a catecholamine and a monoamine, dopamine may be classified as a [[substituted phenethylamine]]. Its name derives from its chemical structure, which consists of an [[amine]] group (NH<sub>2</sub>) linked to a [[catechol]] structure, called dihydroxyphenethylamine, the decarboxylated form of [[L-DOPA|dihydroxyphenylalanine]] (acronym DOPA). In the [[brain]], dopamine functions as a [[neurotransmitter]]—a chemical released by nerve cells to send signals to other nerve cells. The human brain uses five known types of [[dopamine receptor]]s, labeled [[Dopamine D1 receptor|D<sub>1</sub>]], [[Dopamine D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub>]], [[Dopamine D3 receptor|D<sub>3</sub>]], [[Dopamine D4 receptor|D<sub>4</sub>]], and [[Dopamine D5 receptor|D<sub>5</sub>]]. Dopamine is produced in several areas of the brain, including the [[substantia nigra]] and the [[ventral tegmental area]].

Dopamine plays a major role in the brain system that is responsible for reward-driven learning. Every type of reward that has been studied increases the level of dopamine transmission in the brain, and a variety of addictive drugs, including [[stimulant]]s such as [[cocaine]], [[amphetamine]], and [[methamphetamine]], act directly on the dopamine system.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dopamine - A Sample Neurotransmitter|url=http://www.utexas.edu/research/asrec/dopamine.html}}</ref> Personality traits such as [[extraversion]] and reward seeking have been linked to higher sensitivity to rewarding stimuli of the mesolimbic dopamine system.<ref>Depue, R.

Several important diseases of the nervous system are associated with dysfunctions of the dopamine system. [[Parkinson's disease]], an age-related degenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment, is caused by loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in the substantia nigra. [[Schizophrenia]] has been shown to involve elevated levels of dopamine activity in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] and decreased levels of dopamine in the [[prefrontal cortex]].<ref>[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?Volume=148&page=1474&journalID=13] Davis, K.L., Kahn, R.S., Ko, G., Davidson, M.

Dopamine is available as an intravenous medication acting on the [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] [[nervous system]], producing effects such as increased [[heart rate]] and [[blood pressure]]. However, because dopamine cannot cross the [[blood–brain barrier]], dopamine given as a drug does not directly affect the [[central nervous system]]. To increase the amount of dopamine in the brains of patients with diseases such as [[Parkinson's disease]] and dopa-responsive [[dystonia]], [[L-DOPA]] (the precursor of dopamine) is often given because it crosses the blood–brain barrier relatively easily.

==History==
{{Main|History of catecholamine research}}
Dopamine was first synthesized in 1910 by [[George Barger]] and James Ewens at [[Wellcome Trust|Wellcome]] Laboratories in London, England.<ref>[http://movementdisorders.org/education/onlinecme/levodopa/print.pdf Fahn, Stanley, "The History of Levodopa as it Pertains to Parkinson's disease," Movement Disorder Society's 10th International Congress of Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders on November 1, 2006, in Kyoto, Japan.]</ref> It was named dopamine because it is a [[monoamine]] whose [[Precursor chemical|precursor]] in the Barger-Ewens synthesis is 3,4-''d''ihydr''o''xy''p''henyl''a''lanine (levodopamine or [[L-DOPA]]). Dopamine's function as a neurotransmitter was first recognized in 1958 by [[Arvid Carlsson]] and Nils-Åke Hillarp  at the Laboratory for Chemical Pharmacology of the National Heart Institute of [[Sweden]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0165-6147(00)01607-2 | last1 = Benes | first1 = F.M. | year = 2001 | title = Carlsson and the discovery of dopamine | url = | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 46–47 | pmid = 11165672 }}</ref> Carlsson was awarded the 2000 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for showing that dopamine is not only a precursor of [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline) and [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline), but also a neurotransmitter.

==Chemistry==
Structurally, dopamine belongs to the [[catecholamine]] and [[phenethylamine]] classes. The crystal structure of dopamine hydrochloride has been determined.<ref>J. Giesecke (1980). "Refinement of the structure of dopamine hydrochloride." ''Acta Cryst. Sect. B'' '''36''' 178–181.</ref>

In the laboratory, dopamine may be synthesized by [[demethylation]] of [[3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine]] using [[hydrogen bromide]]:<ref>J. S. Bayeler, Ann. Chem., 513, 196 (1934).</ref><ref>G. Hahn, K. Stiehl, Chem. Ber., 69, 2640 (1936).</ref>

[[File:Dopamine synthesis.png|400px|center]]

Basicity: protonated dopamine has three [[acidity constant]]s: pKa<sub>1</sub> = 8.89 (first OH); pKa<sub>2</sub> = 10.41 (-NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>); pKa<sub>3</sub> = 13.1 (second OH); the two phenolic acidity constants cannot be attributed  to a specific -OH group.<ref>T. Kiss and A. Gergely (1979). "Complexes of 3,4-dhydroxyphenyl derivatives. III. Equilibrium study of parent and some mixed ligand complexes of dopamine, alanine and pyrocatechol with nickel(II), copper(II) and zinc(II) ions." ''Inorg. Chim. Acta'' '''36''' 31-36.</ref> Because of the variables involved in pKa determination (see discussions in cited papers), other values may be found in the literature. For example, a careful set of experiments reported by Armstrong and Barlow for dopamine hydrochloride yielded these data: pKa at 25°C and 10mM concentration = 8.81 and 10.5.<ref>J. Armstrong and R. B. Barlow (1976). "The ionization of phenolic amines, including apomorphine, dopamine and catecholamines and an assessment of zwitterion constants." ''Brit. J. Pharmacol.'' '''57''' 501-516.</ref>

==Regulation==

===Biosynthesis===
[[File:Catecholamines biosynthesis.svg|thumb|right|300px|Catecholamine biosynthesis]]

Dopamine is [[biosynthesis|synthesized]] in the body from within [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s (mainly by [[neuron]]s and cells in the [[adrenal medulla|medulla]] of the [[adrenal gland]]s) and can be created from any one of the following three [[amino acid]]s:

* [[L-Phenylalanine|<small>L</small>-Phenylalanine]] (PHE)
* [[L-Tyrosine|<small>L</small>-Tyrosine]] (<small>L</small>-4-hydroxyphenylalanine; TYR)
* [[L-DOPA|<small>L</small>-DOPA]] ('''<small>L</small>'''-3,4-'''d'''ihydr'''o'''xy'''p'''henyl'''a'''lanine; DOPA)

These amino acids are provided from natural sources such as the ingestion of various kinds of food, with <small>L</small>-tyrosine being the most common of the three. Although dopamine itself is also commonly found in many types of food, unlike the amino acids that form it, it is incapable of crossing the protective [[blood-brain-barrier]] (BBB), which severely restricts its functionality upon consumption. It must be formed from within the walls of the BBB to properly perform its cognitive duties, though not its peripheral actions. Dopamine itself is also used in the synthesis of the following related catecholamine neurotransmitters:

* [[Norepinephrine]] (β,3,4-trihydroxyphenethylamine; Noradrenaline; NE, NA)
* [[Epinephrine]] (β,3-dihydroxy-''N''-methylphenethylamine; Adrenaline; EPI, ADR)

This is the complete [[metabolic pathway]]:

* <small>L</small>-Phenylalanine → <small>L</small>-Tyrosine → <small>L</small>-DOPA → Dopamine → Norepinephrine → Epinephrine

<small>L</small>-Phenylalanine is converted into <small>L</small>-tyrosine by the [[enzyme]] [[phenylalanine hydroxylase]] (PAH) with [[molecular]] [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) and [[tetrahydrobiopterin]] (THB) as [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s. <small>L</small>-Tyrosine is converted into <small>L</small>-DOPA by the enzyme [[tyrosine hydroxylase]] (TH) with [[tetrahydrobiopterin]] (THB), O<sub>2</sub>, and [[ferrous]] [[iron]] (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) as cofactors. <small>L</small>-DOPA is converted into dopamine by the enzyme [[aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase|aromatic <small>L</small>-amino acid decarboxylase]] (AAAD; also known as DOPA decarboxylase (DDC)) with [[pyridoxal phosphate]] (PLP) as the cofactor. The reactions are illustrated as follows:

* [[Phenylalanine hydroxylase|PAH]]: <small>L</small>-Phenylalanine + [[Tetrahydrobiopterin|THB]] + [[oxygen|O<sub>2</sub>]] + [[Ferrous|Fe<sup>2+</sup>]] → <small>L</small>-Tyrosine + [[Dihydrobiopterin|DHB]] + [[Water (molecule)|H<sub>2</sub>O]] + [[Ferrous|Fe<sup>2+</sup>]]
* [[Tyrosine hydroxylase|TH]]: <small>L</small>-Tyrosine + [[Tetrahydrobiopterin|THB]] + [[oxygen|O<sub>2</sub>]] + [[Ferrous|Fe<sup>2+</sup>]] → <small>L</small>-DOPA + [[Dihydrofolic acid|DHFA]] + [[Water (molecule)|H<sub>2</sub>O]] + [[Ferrous|Fe<sup>2+</sup>]]
* [[Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase|AAAD]]: <small>L</small>-DOPA + [[Pyridoxal phosphate|PLP]] → Dopamine + [[Pyridoxal phosphate|PLP]] + [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]

Dopamine is converted into norepinephrine by the enzyme [[dopamine beta hydroxylase|dopamine β-hydroxylase]] (DBH) with O<sub>2</sub> and [[ascorbic acid|<small>L</small>-ascorbic acid]] as cofactors. Finally, norepinephrine is converted into epinephrine by the enzyme [[phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase|phenylethanolamine ''N''-methyltransferase]] (PNMT) with [[S-adenosyl-L-methionine|''S''-adenosyl-<small>L</small>-methionine]] (SAMe) as the cofactor. The reactions are illustrated as follows:

* [[Dopamine beta hydroxylase|DBH]]: Dopamine + [[Ascorbic Acid]] + [[Oxygen|O<sub>2</sub>]] → Norepinephrine + [[Dehydroascorbic acid|DHA]] + [[Water (molecule)|H<sub>2</sub>O]]
* [[Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase|PNMT]]: Norepinephrine + [[S-adenosyl-L-methionine|SAMe]] → Epinephrine + [[Homocysteine]]

It should be noted that some of the cofactors also require their own synthesis. These include:

* [[Guanine]] → [[Guanosine]] → [[Guanosine monophosphate|Guanosine Monophosphate]] (GMP) → [[Guanosine diphosphate|Guanosine Diphosphate]] (GDP) → [[Guanosine triphosphate|Guanosine Triphosphate]] (GTP)
* [[GTP cyclohydrolase I|GTP Cyclohydrolase I]] (GTPCH, GCH): [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] → [[7,8-Dihydroneopterin triphosphate|7,8-Dihydroneopterin Triphosphate]] (DHNTP)
* [[6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase|6-Pyruvoyltetrahydropterin Synthase]] (PTS, PTPS): [[7,8-Dihydroneopterin triphosphate|DHNTP]] → [[6-Pyruvoyltetrahydropterin]] (Dyspropterin)
* [[Sepiapterin reductase|Sepiapterin Reductase]] (SPR): [[Dyspropterin]] → [[Tetrahydrobiopterin]] (THB)

* [[Folic acid|Folic Acid]] → [[Dihydrofolic acid|DHFA]] → [[Tetrahydrofolic acid|THFA]]

* [[Pyridoxine]] → [[Pyridoxamine]] → [[Pyridoxal]] → [[Pyridoxal phosphate|PLP]] (requires [[Zinc|Zn<sup>2+</sup>]] as a cofactor)

* [[Niacin]] → [[Nicotinamide]] → [[N-Methylnicotinamide|NMN]] → [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD<sup>+</sub>]] → [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]] / [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADP<sup>+</sub>]] → [[NADPH]]

Deficiency in any required amino acid or cofactor will result in subsequent dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine biosynthesis impairment and deficiency as well. Conversely, supplementation with L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine, L-DOPA, or any of the cofactors will increase their respective concentrations.

===Storage, release, and reuptake===
Upon synthesis, dopamine is [[active transport|transported]] from the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] [[cytosol]] into [[vesicle (biology)|synaptic vesicle]]s by the [[vesicular monoamine transporter 2]] (VMAT2). Dopamine is stored in and remains in these vesicles until an [[action potential]] occurs and forces them to merge with the [[cell membrane]] via a process known as [[exocytosis]], thereby dumping dopamine into [[synapse]]s.

Once in the synapse, dopamine [[binding (molecular)|bind]]s to and activates [[postsynaptic]] [[dopamine receptor]]s, resulting in the signal of the [[presynaptic]] cell being propagated to the postsynaptic neuron. Dopamine also binds to presynaptic dopamine receptors, which can either excite the presynaptic cell or inhibit it depending on their [[electrical potential]]. Presynaptic receptors with an inhibitory potential are called [[autoreceptor]]s and inhibit neurotransmitter synthesis and release. They serve to keep dopamine levels normalized in certain pathways when release is acutely disrupted and becomes too high or too low.

After dopamine has performed its synaptic duties, it is taken up via [[reuptake]] back into the presynaptic cell by either the high-affinity [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT) or the low-affinity [[plasma membrane monoamine transporter]] (PMAT). Once back in the cytosol, it is subsequently repackaged into vesicles by VMAT2.

===Degradation===
[[File:Dopamine degradation.svg|thumb|right|400px|Dopamine degradation]]

Dopamine is directly broken down into inactive metabolites by two enzymes, [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO) and [[catechol-O-methyl transferase|catechol-''O''-methyl transferase]] (COMT). It is equally metabolized by the two respective [[isoform]]s of MAO, [[MAO-A]] and [[MAO-B]].

Dopamine is metabolized by MAO into [[3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde]] (DOPAL). DOPAL is further metabolized into [[3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid]] (DOPAC) by the enzyme [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] (ALDH). DOPAL can also be reduced to [[3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol]] (DOPET; also known as [[hydroxytyrosol]]) by [[aldose reductase]] (AR) to a lesser extent. Finally, COMT reduces DOPAC and DOPET to [[homovanillic acid]] (HVA) and [[3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethanol]] (MOPET), respectively, which are then excreted in the urine. COMT can also directly metabolize dopamine into [[3-methoxytyramine]] (3-MT), which is then subsequently metabolized to HVA by MAO and is excreted in the urine as well. The reactions are illustrated and summarized here:

* Dopamine → DOPAL → DOPAC → HVA
* Dopamine → DOPAL → DOPET → MOPET
* Dopamine → 3-MT → HVA

In most areas of the brain, including the [[striatum]] and [[basal ganglia]], dopamine is inactivated by reuptake via the DAT, then enzymatic breakdown by MAO into DOPAC. In the [[prefrontal cortex]], however, there are very few DAT proteins, and dopamine is inactivated instead by reuptake via the [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET), presumably on neighboring norepinephrine neurons, then enzymatic breakdown by COMT into 3-MT.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morón |first1=JA |last2=Brockington |first2=A |last3=Wise |first3=RA |last4=Rocha |first4=BA |last5=Hope |first5=BT |title=Dopamine uptake through the norepinephrine transporter in brain regions with low levels of the dopamine transporter: evidence from knock-out mouse lines. |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/22/2/389 |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=389–95 |year=2002 |pmid=11784783 }}</ref> The DAT pathway is roughly an order of magnitude faster than the NET pathway: in mice, dopamine concentrations decay with a half-life of 200 milliseconds in the [[caudate nucleus]] (which uses the DAT pathway) versus 2,000 milliseconds in the prefrontal cortex.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0665-07.2007 |last1=Yavich |first1=L |last2=Forsberg |first2=MM |last3=Karayiorgou |first3=M |last4=Gogos |first4=JA |last5=Männistö |first5=PT |title=Site-specific role of catechol-O-methyltransferase in dopamine overflow within prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum. |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/38/10196 |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=27 |issue=38 |pages=10196–209 |year=2007 |pmid=17881525 }}</ref> Dopamine that is not broken down by enzymes is repackaged into vesicles for reuse by [[VMAT2]].

==Receptors==
{{Main|Dopamine receptor}}

Dopamine binds to and activates a group of [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s called the [[dopamine receptor]]s to mediate its physiological effects in the body. The dopamine receptors are a series of five [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s (GPCRs), which consist of the [[dopamine receptor D1|D<sub>1</sub>]], [[dopamine receptor D2|D<sub>2</sub>]], [[dopamine receptor D3|D<sub>3</sub>]], [[dopamine receptor D4|D<sub>4</sub>]], and [[dopamine receptor D5|D<sub>5</sub> receptor]]s. As GPCRs, they work by modulating the [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP) [[second messenger system]] to produce a cellular response. The five receptors are individually categorized into two distinctive groups based on their varying properties and effects, the [[D1-like receptor|D1-like]] and [[D2-like receptor|D2-like]] [[protein family|subfamilies]]. The D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>5</sub> receptors belong to the D1-like subfamily. They are coupled to [[G(s)alpha|G<sub>s</sub>]] and increase the cellular [[concentration]]s of cAMP  by the activation of the enzyme [[adenylate cyclase]]. The D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, and D<sub>4</sub> receptors belong to the D2-like subfamily. They are coupled to [[Gi alpha subunit|G<sub>i</sub>/G<sub>o</sub>]] and decrease the cellular concentrations of [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] by inhibition of [[adenylate cyclase]]. Ultimately, the cAMP second messenger system, through several downstream mechanisms, works by modulating the opening of [[plasmalemmal]] [[ion channel]]s that allow [[electric charge|positively charged]] [[ion]]s such as [[Na+|Na<sup>+</sup>]] and [[Potassium|K<sup>+</sup>]] to enter or exit the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell, thereby generating or inhibiting an [[action potential]]. The receptors also couple directly to ion channels via the G-proteins. The D1-like receptors have various effects on neuronal activity, while the D2-like receptors tend to decrease action potential generation and are therefore usually [[inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibitory]].

The D<sub>1</sub> receptor is the most widespread dopamine receptor in the central nervous system. The D<sub>3</sub>, D<sub>4</sub>, and D<sub>5</sub> receptors are present in significantly lower levels than are the D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors. In fact, the D<sub>1</sub> receptors are approximately 100x more common than the D<sub>5</sub> receptors. However, dopamine binds to the D<sub>3</sub>, D<sub>4</sub>, and D<sub>5</sub> receptors with [[molar concentration|nanomolar]] or [[molar concentration|submicromolar]] [[chemical affinity|affinity]] [[dissociation constant|constant]]s, while its corresponding constants for D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors are in the [[molar concentration|micromolar]] ranges. As an example, dopamine has 20-fold higher binding affinity for the D<sub>3</sub> receptor in comparison to the D<sub>2</sub> receptor, and 10-fold higher binding affinity for the D<sub>5</sub> receptor over the D<sub>1</sub> receptor. Hence, overall activation of the system seem to be more or less well-balanced.

==Functions in the brain== <!-- Neurotransmitter systems has a link to here -->
[[File:Dopamine pathways.svg|thumb|Dopamine pathways. In the brain, dopamine plays an important role in the regulation of reward and movement. As part of the reward pathway, dopamine is manufactured in nerve cell bodies located within the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and is released in the nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex. Its motor functions are linked to a separate pathway, with cell bodies in the substantia nigra that manufacture and release dopamine into the striatum.]]
Dopamine has many functions in the brain, including important roles in behavior and [[cognition]], [[animal locomotion|voluntary movement]], [[motivation]], [[punishment]] and [[reward system|reward]], inhibition of [[prolactin]] production (involved in [[lactation]] and [[prolactin#Effects|sexual gratification]]), [[sleep]], [[dream]]ing,<ref>/http://www.dukehealth.org/health_library/news/9904</ref> [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], [[attention]], [[working memory]], and [[learning]]. [[Dopaminergic]] neurons (i.e., neurons whose primary neurotransmitter is dopamine) are present chiefly in the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) of the [[midbrain]], the [[substantia nigra|substantia nigra pars compacta]], and the [[arcuate nucleus]] of the hypothalamus.

It has been hypothesized that dopamine transmits reward prediction error, although this has been questioned.<ref name="dopamine function">{{cite journal | author=Peter Redgrave, Kevin Gurney|title=The short-latency dopamine signal: a role in discovering novel actions? |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=7 |pages=967–975 |year=2006 |doi=10.1038/nrn2022 | pmid=17115078 | issue=12}}</ref> According to this hypothesis, the phasic responses of dopamine neurons are observed when an unexpected reward is presented. These responses transfer to the onset of a [[Classical conditioning|conditioned stimulus]] after repeated pairings with the reward. Further, dopamine neurons are depressed when the expected reward is omitted. Thus, dopamine neurons seem to [[Neural encoding|encode]] the prediction error of rewarding outcomes. In nature, we learn to repeat behaviors that lead to maximizing rewards. Dopamine is therefore believed to provide a teaching signal to parts of the brain responsible for acquiring new behavior.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9658025 Predictive reward signal of dopamine neurons] - 2005: ''By signaling rewards according to a prediction error, dopamine responses have the formal characteristics of a teaching signal postulated by reinforcement learning theories''</ref> [[Temporal difference learning]] provides a computational model describing how the prediction error of dopamine neurons is used as a teaching signal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Anatomy===
{{Main|Dopaminergic pathways}}
[[Dopaminergic]] neurons form a [[neurotransmitter system]] which originates in ''[[substantia nigra pars compacta]]'', [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA), and [[hypothalamus]]. These project [[axon]]s to large areas of the brain which are typically divided into four major pathways:

* [[Mesocortical pathway]] connects the ventral tegmental area to the frontal lobe of the [[pre-frontal cortex]]. Neurons with [[Soma (biology)|somas]] in the ventral tegmental area project axons into the pre-frontal cortex.
* [[Mesolimbic pathway]] carries dopamine from the ventral tegmental area to the [[nucleus accumbens]] via the [[amygdala]] and [[hippocampus]].  The somas of the projecting neurons are in the ventral tegmental area.
* [[Nigrostriatal pathway]] runs from the substantia nigra to the [[neostriatum]].  Somas in the substantia nigra project axons into the [[caudate nucleus]] and [[putamen]].  The pathway is involved in the basal ganglia motor loop.
* [[Tuberoinfundibular pathway]] runs from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland.

This innervation explains many of the effects of activating this dopamine system. For instance, the [[mesolimbic pathway]] connects the VTA and ''[[nucleus accumbens]]''; both are central to the brain [[reward system]].<ref>[http://www.pdn.cam.ac.uk/staff/schultz/ Schultz, Cambridge university, UK]</ref>

Whilst the distinction between pathways is widely used, and is regarded as a "convenient heuristic when considering the dopamine system", it is not absolute, and there is some overlap in the projection targets of each group of neurons.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Bjorklund A, Dunnett SB |title=Dopamine neuron systems in the brain: an update |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |year=2007 |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=194–202 |pmid=17408759 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2007.03.006 }}</ref>

===Cellular effects===

====Tonic and phasic activity====
The level of extracellular dopamine is modulated by two mechanisms: tonic and phasic dopamine transmission. Tonic dopamine transmission occurs when small amounts of dopamine are released independently of neuronal activity, and is regulated by the activity of other neurons and neurotransmitter reuptake.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Grace AA, |title=Phasic versus tonic dopamine release and the modulation of dopamine system responsivity: A hypothesis for the eitiology of schizophrenia |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T0F-485YGDY-4&_user=128590&_coverDate=12%2F31%2F1991&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1403836309&_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&_acct=C000010619&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=128590&md5=1c4978d564d1aaa5afc501a3454d469c |format=PDF |journal=Neuroscience |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=1–24 |year=1991 |pmid=1676137 |doi=10.1016/0306-4522(91)90196-U }}</ref> Phasic dopamine release results from the activity of the dopamine-containing cells themselves.

====Reuptake inhibition and synaptic release====
Cocaine and amphetamines inhibit the [[re-uptake]] of dopamine; however, they influence separate mechanisms of action. Cocaine is a [[dopamine transporter]] and [[norepinephrine transporter]] blocker that competitively inhibits dopamine uptake to increase the lifetime of dopamine and augments an overabundance of dopamine (an increase of up to 150 percent) within the parameters of the dopamine neurotransmitters. Like cocaine, amphetamines increase the concentration of dopamine in the [[synapse|synaptic]] gap, but by a different mechanism. Amphetamines and [[methamphetamine]] are similar in structure to dopamine, and so can enter the terminal bouton of the presynaptic neuron via its dopamine transporters as well as by diffusing through the neural membrane directly.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} By entering the presynaptic neuron, amphetamines force dopamine molecules out of their storage [[Synaptic vesicle|vesicles]] and expel them into the synaptic gap by making the dopamine transporters work in reverse.

===Motor control===
Dopamine reduces the influence of the indirect pathway while increasing the actions of the direct pathway within the [[basal ganglia]].<ref name="australianprescriber.com">http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/17/1/17/21</ref> Insufficient dopamine [[biosynthesis]] in the dopaminergic neurons can cause [[Parkinson's disease]], a condition in which one loses the ability to execute smooth, controlled movements.<ref name="australianprescriber.com"/>

===Regulating prolactin secretion===
Dopamine is the primary [[neuroendocrine]] inhibitor of the secretion of [[prolactin]] from the [[anterior pituitary]] gland.<ref name="prolactininhibition">{{cite journal |author=Ben-Jonathan N, Hnasko R  |title=Dopamine as a Prolactin (PRL) Inhibitor|journal=Endocrine Reviews |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=724–763 |year=2001| doi = 10.1210/er.22.6.724|url=http://edrv.endojournals.org/cgi/reprint/22/6/724.pdf|format=PDF |pmid=11739329}}</ref> Dopamine produced by neurons in the [[arcuate nucleus]] of the hypothalamus is secreted into the [[Hypophyseal portal system|hypothalamo-hypophysial blood vessels]] of the [[median eminence]], which supply the [[pituitary gland]]. The lactotrope cells that produce [[prolactin]], in the absence of dopamine, secrete prolactin continuously; dopamine inhibits this secretion. Thus, in the context of regulating prolactin secretion, dopamine is occasionally called prolactin-inhibiting factor (PIF), prolactin-inhibiting hormone (PIH), or prolactostatin.

===Cognition and frontal cortex===
In the [[frontal lobe]]s, dopamine controls the flow of information from other areas of the brain. Dopamine disorders in this region of the brain can cause a decline in [[neurocognitive]] functions, especially [[memory]], [[attention]], and [[problem-solving]]. Reduced dopamine concentrations in the prefrontal cortex are thought to contribute to [[attention deficit disorder]]. It has been found that D1 receptors<ref name="Inhibitorydopamine">{{cite journal |author=Heijtz RD, Kolb B, Forssberg H |title=Motor inhibitory role of dopamine D1 receptors: implications for ADHD |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6T0P-4NTB97R-Y-1&_cdi=4868&_user=308069&_orig=search&_coverDate=09%2F30%2F2007&_sk=999079998&view=c&wchp=dGLbVzz-zSkzV&md5=c49d721e7e713190c2ac6fab7a491093&ie=/sdarticle.pdf |format=PDF|journal=Physiol Behav |volume=92 |issue=1–2 |pages=155–160 |year=2007 |pmid=17585966 |doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2007.05.024 }}</ref> as well as D4 receptors<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Browman | first1 = KE | last2 = Curzon | first2 = P | last3 = Pan | first3 = JB | last4 = Molesky | first4 = AL | last5 = Komater | first5 = VA | last6 = Decker | first6 = MW | last7 = Brioni | first7 = JD | last8 = Moreland | first8 = RB | last9 = Fox | first9 = GB | title = A-412997, a selective dopamine D4 agonist, improves cognitive performance in rats | journal = Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior | volume = 82 | issue = 1 | pages = 148–55 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16154186 | doi = 10.1016/j.pbb.2005.08.002 }}</ref> are responsible for the cognitive-enhancing effects of dopamine, whereas D2 receptors are more specific for motor actions.

===Chemoreceptor trigger zone===
Dopamine is one of the neurotransmitters implicated in the control of [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]] via interactions in the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]].  [[Metoclopramide]] is a D2-receptor antagonist that functions as a [[prokinetic]]/[[antiemetic]].

===Effects of drugs that reduce dopamine activity===
In humans, drugs that reduce dopamine activity ([[neuroleptic]]s, e.g. [[antipsychotic]]s) have been shown to impair concentration, reduce motivation, cause [[anhedonia]] (inability to experience pleasure), and long-term use has been associated with [[tardive dyskinesia]], an irreversible movement disorder.<ref name="fn2">{{cite journal | author = Lambert M, Schimmelmann B, Karow A, Naber D | title = Subjective well-being and initial dysphoric reaction under antipsychotic drugs - concepts, measurement and clinical relevance | journal = Pharmacopsychiatry | volume = 36 | issue = Suppl 3| pages = S181–90 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14677077 | doi = 10.1055/s-2003-45128}}</ref> Antipsychotics have significant effects on gonadal hormones including significantly lower levels of estradiol and progesterone in women, whereas men display significantly lower levels of testosterone and [[DHEA]] when undergoing antipsychotic drug treatment compared to controls.

The effects of hyperprolactinemia in men are [[gynaecomastia]], [[lactation]], [[impotence]], loss of [[libido]], and [[spermatogenesis|hypospermatogenesis]].<ref name="Raji2005">{{cite journal | last1 = Raji  | first1 = Y.| last2 = Ifabunmi | first2 = S.O. | last3 = Akinsomisoye | first3 = O.S. | last4 = Morakinyo | first4 = A.O. | last5 = Oloyo | first5 = A.K. | title = Gonadal Responses to Antipsychotic Drugs: Chlorpromazine and Thioridazine Reversibly Suppress Testicular Functions in Albino Rats | journal = International Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | year = 2005 | page = 287292 | issn = 18117775 | doi = 10.3923/ijp.2005.287.292}}</ref> Furthermore, antipsychotic drugs are associated with [[weight gain]], [[diabetes]], [[drooling]], [[dysphoria]] (abnormal depression and discontent), [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[sexual dysfunction]], [[heart rhythm]] problems, [[stroke]] and [[heart attack]].

===Opioid and cannabinoid transmission===
[[Opioid]] and [[cannabinoid]] transmission instead of dopamine may modulate consummatory pleasure and food palatability (liking).<ref name="fn4">{{cite journal | author = Peciña S, Berridge K | title = Hedonic hot spot in nucleus accumbens shell: where do mu-opioids cause increased hedonic impact of sweetness? | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 25 | issue = 50 | pages = 11777–86 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16354936 | url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/jneuro;25/50/11777 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2329-05.2005}}</ref>
This could explain why animals' liking of food is independent of brain dopamine concentration. Other consummatory pleasures, however, may be more associated with dopamine. One study found that both anticipatory and consummatory measures of sexual behavior (male rats) were disrupted by DA receptor antagonists.<ref name="fn6">{{cite journal | author = Pfaus J, Phillips A | title = Role of dopamine in anticipatory and consummatory aspects of sexual behavior in the male rat | journal = Behav Neurosci | volume = 105 | issue = 5 | pages = 727–43 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1840012 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7044.105.5.727}}</ref> Libido can be increased by drugs that affect dopamine, but not by drugs that affect [[opioid peptide]]s or other neurotransmitters.

===Learning, reinforcement, and reward-seeking behavior===
Dopamine is commonly associated with the [[reward system]] of the brain, providing feelings of enjoyment and [[reinforcement]] to motivate a person to perform certain activities. Dopamine is released (particularly in areas such as the [[nucleus accumbens]] and [[prefrontal cortex]]) as a result of [[reward system|rewarding]] experiences such as [[food]], [[Human sexual behaviour|sex]], [[drugs]], and [[neutral stimulus|neutral stimuli]] that become [[Classical conditioning|associated]] with them.<ref name="fn5">{{cite journal | author = Arias-Carrión O, Pöppel E | title = Dopamine, learning and reward-seeking behavior | journal = Act Neurobiol Exp | volume = 67 | issue = 4 | pages = 481–488 | year = 2007|url=http://www.ane.pl/pdfdownload.php?art=6738 }} {{Dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> Recent studies indicate that [[aggression]] may also stimulate the release of dopamine in this way.<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/94023.php ''Dopamine Involved In Aggression - Medical News Today'']</ref>

Dopaminergic neurons of the midbrain are the main source of dopamine in the brain.<ref name="fn5"/>  Dopamine has been shown to be involved in the control of movements, the signaling of error in prediction of reward, motivation, and cognition. Cerebral dopamine depletion is the hallmark of Parkinson's disease.<ref name="fn5">{{cite journal | author = Arias-Carrión O, Freundlieb N, Oertel WH, Höglinger GU | title = Adult neurogenesis and Parkinson's disease | journal = CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets. | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 326–335. | year = 2007 | pmid = 18045161 | doi = 10.2174/187152707783220875}}</ref> Other pathological states have also been associated with dopamine dysfunction, such as [[schizophrenia]], [[autism]], and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], as well as [[drug abuse]].

====Animal studies====
Clues to dopamine's role in motivation, desire, and pleasure have come from studies performed on animals. In one such study, rats were depleted of dopamine by up to 99 percent in the [[nucleus accumbens]] and [[neostriatum]] using 6-hydroxydopamine.<!--
--><ref name="fn5">{{cite journal | author = Berridge K, Robinson T | title = What is the role of dopamine in reward: hedonic impact, reward learning, or incentive salience? | journal = Brain Res Brain Res Rev | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 309–69 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9858756 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0173(98)00019-8}}</ref>
With this large reduction in dopamine, the rats would no longer eat of their own volition. The researchers then force-fed the rats food and noted whether they had the proper facial expressions indicating whether they liked or disliked it. The researchers of this study concluded that the reduction in dopamine did not reduce the rat's consummatory pleasure, only the desire to eat. In another study, mutant hyperdopaminergic (increased dopamine) mice show higher "wanting" but not "liking" of sweet rewards.<!--

Dopamine modulates foraging behavior in animals, by activating brain systems registering reward when food sources are found.<ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15516709cog0000_50/abstract</ref> When monkeys are given a highly palatable food, dopamine levels rise, but levels then decline when the palatable food is available for prolonged periods of time and is no longer novel.<ref>http://www.jneurosci.org/content/13/3/900.full.pdf</ref>

===Salience===
{{Further|Incentive salience}}
Dopamine may also have a role in the [[Salience (neuroscience)|salience]] of potentially important stimuli, such as sources of reward or of danger.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Schultz W | title = Getting formal with dopamine and reward | journal = Neuron | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 241–263 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12383780 | doi = 10.1016/S0896-6273(02)00967-4}}</ref> This hypothesis argues that dopamine assists decision-making by influencing the priority, or level of desire, of such stimuli to the person concerned.

Dopamine's role in experiencing pleasure has been questioned by several researchers. It has been argued that dopamine is more associated with anticipatory desire and motivation (commonly referred to as "wanting") as opposed to actual consummatory pleasure (commonly referred to as "liking").{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Latent inhibition and creative drive===
Dopamine in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] increases general [[arousal]] and goal directed behaviors and decreases [[latent inhibition]]; all three effects increase the creative drive of idea generation. This has led to a three-factor model of [[creativity]] involving the [[frontal lobe]]s, the [[temporal lobe]]s, and mesolimbic dopamine.<ref>{{cite journal | author= Flaherty, A.W, | year = 2005 | journal = Journal of Comparative Neurology | title = Frontotemporal and dopaminergic control of idea generation and creative drive | volume = 493 | issue = 1 | pages = 147–153 | pmid = 16254989 | doi = 10.1002/cne.20768 | pmc= 2571074}}</ref>

===Sociability===
Since dopamine drives reward-seeking behavior and successive sensations of contentment from social interactions,<ref>{{cite web|last=Poquérusse|first=Jessie|title=The Neuroscience of Sharing|url=https://www.uniiverse.com/neuroscience|accessdate=16 August 2012}}</ref> sociability is also closely tied to dopamine neurotransmission. Low D2 receptor-binding is found in people with [[social anxiety]]. Traits common to negative [[schizophrenia]] ([[social withdrawal]], [[apathy]], [[anhedonia]]) are thought to be related to a hypodopaminergic state in certain areas of the brain.

===Dopaminergic mind hypothesis===
The dopaminergic mind hypothesis seeks to explain the differences between modern humans and their hominid relatives by focusing on changes in dopamine.<ref name=Previc>Previc F (2009). ''The Dopaminergic Mind in Human Evolution and History'' Cambridge University Press. ISBN 978-0-521-51699-0.</ref> It theorizes that increased levels of dopamine were part of a general physiological adaptation due to an increased consumption of meat around two million years ago in ''[[Homo habilis]]'', and later enhanced by changes in diet and other environmental and social factors beginning approximately 80,000 years ago. Under this theory, the "high-dopamine" personality is characterized by high intelligence, a sense of personal destiny, a religious/cosmic preoccupation, an obsession with achieving goals and conquests, an emotional detachment that in many cases leads to ruthlessness, and a risk-taking mentality. High levels of dopamine are proposed to underlie increased psychological disorders in industrialized societies. According to this hypothesis, a "dopaminergic society" is an extremely goal-oriented, fast-paced, and even manic society, "given that dopamine is known to increase activity levels, speed up our internal clocks and create a preference for novel over unchanging environments."<ref name=Previc/> In the same way that high-dopamine individuals lack empathy and exhibit a more masculine behavioral style, dopaminergic societies are "typified by more conquest, competition, and aggression than nurturance and communality."<ref name=Previc/> Although behavioral evidence and some indirect anatomical evidence (e.g., enlargement of the dopamine-rich striatum in humans)<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0165-0173(90)90004-8 | last1 = Rapoport | first1 = S.

[[L-DOPA|Levodopa]] is a dopamine precursor used in various forms to treat [[Parkinson's disease]] and dopa-responsive [[dystonia]]. It is typically co-administered with an inhibitor of peripheral decarboxylation (DDC, [[Aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase|dopa decarboxylase]]), such as [[carbidopa]] or [[benserazide]].

==In plants==

===Fruit browning===
[[Polyphenol oxidase]]s (PPOs) are a family of enzymes responsible for the [[Browning (chemical process)|browning]] of fresh fruits and vegetables when they are cut or bruised. These enzymes use molecular [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) to [[redox|oxidise]] various [[benzenediol|1,2-diphenols]] to their corresponding [[quinone]]s. The natural substrate for PPOs in [[banana]]s is dopamine. The product of their oxidation, dopamine quinone, spontaneously oxidises to other quinones. The quinones then [[polymerisation|polymerise]] and [[condense]] with [[amino acid]]s and [[protein]]s to form brown [[biological pigment|pigments]] known as [[melanin]]s. The quinones and melanins derived from dopamine may help protect damaged fruit and vegetables against growth of [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]].<ref name="mayer">{{cite journal | author = Mayer, AM | title = Polyphenol oxidases in plants and fungi: Going places?
