== External reviews ==

=== GiveWell review ===

VillageReach was given a "Gold" rating by charity evaluator [[GiveWell]], a US-based non-profit that rates charities. Until November 2011, it was the top recommended charity. GiveWell estimated<ref>[http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/villagereach#Whatdoyougetforyourdollar GiveWell review of VillageReach]</ref> that it costs between $400–$800 of donor money to save an additional life. GiveWell estimated<ref>[http://blog.givewell.org/2011/02/08/stats-on-givewells-money-moved-and-web-traffic/ GiveWell money moved and web traffic summary for 2010]</ref> that in 2010, it directed about 1.1 million USD in charitable donations to VillageReach.

In late November 2011, GiveWell updated its list of recommended charities.<ref>[http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities GiveWell's list of top rated charities]</ref> Although GiveWell continued to consider VillageReach an outstanding charity, VillageReach was removed from the list of top rated charities because GiveWell believed that VillageReach does not have enough room for more funding in the short term.<ref>[http://blog.givewell.org/2011/10/26/givewell-is-aiming-to-have-a-new-1-charity-by-december/ GiveWell blog post describing their decision to have new top rated charities before December 2011]</ref>

In March 2012, GiveWell published an update on VillageReach indicating that VillageReach's project had run into some unexpected troubles and would therefore cost more and proceed slower than previously anticipated, but applauding VillageReach for its continued commitment to transparency and sharing their data with GiveWell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/villagereach/updates#March262012update| title = VillageReach update (March 26, 2012)|date = 2012-03-26|publisher = GiveWell}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/2012/03/26/villagereach-update/|title = VillageReach update (blog post)|publisher = GiveWell|date = 2012-03-26}}</ref> John Beale of VillageReach wrote a guest post for GiveWell with his thoughts on this latest update.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/2012/03/26/guest-post-from-john-beale-at-villagereach/|title = Guest post from John Beale at VillageReach|last = Beale|first = John|date = 2012-03-26|publisher = GiveWell}}</ref>

In July 2012, GiveWell published a blog post revisiting their past review of VillageReach's pilot project. GiveWell staff came to the conclusion that in their original review of VillageReach, they had overlooked or underestimated various sources of uncertainty and that this may have led them to overstate their confidence in VillageReach's approach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/2012/07/26/rethinking-villagereachs-pilot-project/|title = Rethinking VillageReach’s pilot project|last = Hassenfeld|first = Elie|publisher=GiveWell|date = 2012-07-26}}</ref>

==Media and blog coverage==

VillageReach was covered in an article in the US weekly [[Newsweek]] in 2005.<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/2005/07/24/blaise-judja-sato.html Newsweek article on VillageReach]</ref>
