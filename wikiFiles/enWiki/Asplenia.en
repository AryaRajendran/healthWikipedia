'''Asplenia''' refers to the absence of normal [[spleen]] function and is associated with some serious infection risks. '''Hyposplenism''' is used to describe reduced ('hypo-') splenic functioning, but not as severely affected as with asplenism.

==Causes==
===Congenital===
* '''[[Congenital]] asplenia''' (rare) may be due to genetic disorders, (i.e. [[heterotaxy syndrome]]).

===Acquired===
* '''[[Acquired disorder|Acquired]] asplenia''' occurs for several reasons:
**Following [[splenectomy]] due to [[splenic rupture]] from [[Physical trauma|trauma]] or because of [[tumor]]
**After splenectomy with the ''goal'' of interfering with splenic function, as a treatment for diseases (e.g. [[idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]], [[thalassemia]], [[spherocytosis]]), in which the spleen's usual activity exacerbates the disease
**Due to underlying diseases that destroy the spleen ([[autosplenectomy]]), e.g. [[sickle-cell disease]].
* '''''Functional'' asplenia''' occurs when splenic tissue is present but does not work well, e.g. sickle-cell disease, [[polysplenia]]; such patients are managed as if asplenic.

===Partial splenectomy and preservation of splenic function===
In an effort to preserve some of the spleen's protective roles,<ref name="pmid957066">{{cite journal |author=Grosfeld JL, Ranochak JE |title=Are hemisplenectomy and/or primary splenic repair feasible? |journal=J. Pediatr.

This may be particularly important in poorer countries where protective measures for patients with asplenia are not available.<ref name="pmid18031639">{{cite journal |author=Sheikha AK, Salih ZT, Kasnazan KH, ''et al.'' |title=Prevention of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection in thalassemia patients by partial rather than total splenectomy |journal=Can J Surg |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=382–6 |year=2007 |pmid=18031639 |doi= |pmc=2386178}}</ref>
However it has been advised that preoperative vaccination is advisable until the remnant splenic tissue can reestablish its function.<ref name="pmid9660206">{{cite journal |author=Kimber C, Spitz L, Drake D, ''et al.'' |title=Elective partial splenectomy in childhood |journal=J. Pediatr. Surg. |volume=33 |issue=6 |pages=826–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9660206 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3468(98)90651-0}}</ref>

==Risks==
Asplenia is a form of [[immunodeficiency]], increasing the risk of [[sepsis]] from [[polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria]],<ref name=Brigden2001/> and can result in [[overwhelming post splenectomy infection]] (OPSI), often fatal within a few hours. In particular, patients are at risk from [[Pneumococcus]], ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', and [[meningococcus]].<ref name=Brigden2001>{{cite pmid|11272299}}</ref> The risk is elevated as much as 350&ndash;fold.<ref name="RedBook2006">[[AAP Red Book]] 2006.</ref>

The risk to asplenic patients has been expressed as equivalent to an adult dying in a road traffic accident (in every 100 people without spleens, 1 to 5 would develop a severe infection per decade) (reference UK Splenectomy Trust Advice)&mdash;hence sensible precautions are advisable.<!--

==Management==
To minimise the risks associated with splenectomy, [[antibiotic]] and [[vaccination]] protocols have been established,<ref name="BMJ1996">{{cite journal | author=Working Party of the British Committee for Standards in Haematology Clinical Haematology Task Force | title=Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of infection in patients with an absent or dysfunctional spleen.

===Antibiotic prophylaxis===
Because of the increased risk of infection, physicians administer oral antibiotics as a [[prophylaxis]] after a surgical splenectomy (or starting at birth, for congenital asplenia or functional asplenia). The duration suggested varies: one suggestion is that antibiotics be taken for two years or until the age of sixteen years old is reached, whichever is longer.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Patients are also cautioned to start a full-dose course of antibiotics at the first onset of an [[upper respiratory tract infection|upper]] or [[lower respiratory tract infection]] (for example, sore throat or cough), or at the onset of any fever.

===Vaccinations===
It is suggested that splenectomized persons receive the following vaccinations, and ideally prior to planned splenectomy surgery:
*[[Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine]] (not before 2 years of age).  Children may first need one or more boosters of  [[pneumococcal conjugate vaccine]] if they did not complete the full childhood series.
*[[Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine]], especially if not received in childhood.  For adults who have not been previously vaccinated,  two doses given two months apart was advised in the new 2006 UK vaccination guidelines (in the UK may be given as a combined Hib/MenC vaccine).<ref name="GreenBook">{{cite book |author=Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation |editor=Editors Salisbury D, Ramsay M, Noakes K |title=Immunisation Against Infectious Disease 2006 |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Policyandguidance/Healthandsocialcaretopics/Greenbook/DH_4097254 |chapter=Chapter 7 : Immunisation of individuals with underlying medical conditions |chapterurl=http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dID=115681&Rendition=Web |format=PDF |publisher=Stationery Office |location=Edinburgh |date=21 December 2006 |pages= |isbn=0-11-322528-8 |oclc= |doi= }} - ''see pages 50-1 and table 7.1''</ref>
*[[Neisseria meningitidis#Vaccines|Meningococcal conjugate vaccine]], especially if not received in adolescence.  Previously vaccinated adults require a single booster and non-immunised adults advised, in UK since 2006, to have two doses given two months apart.<ref name="GreenBook"/>  Children too young for the conjugate vaccine should receive [[Neisseria meningitidis#Vaccines|meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine]] in the interim.<ref name="RedBook2006"/>
*[[Influenza vaccine]], every winter, to help prevent getting secondary bacterial infection.

===Travel measures===
In addition to the normal immunisations advised for the countries to be visited, Group A [[meningococcus]] should be included if visiting countries of particular risk (e.g. sub-saharan Africa).<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Meningococcal - Children and adults with asplenia or splenic dysfunction |title=Immunisation against infectious disease - 'The Green Book' |origyear=2006 |date=24 August 2009|page=244 |chapterurl=http://www.dh.gov.uk/dr_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_104554.pdf |format=PDF |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Healthprotection/Immunisation/Greenbook}}</ref> The non-conjugated Meningitis A and C vaccines usually used for this purpose give only 3 years coverage and provide less-effective long-term cover for Meningitis C than the conjugated form already mentioned.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Chief Medical Officer| title=Meningococcal immunisation for asplenic patients| work=Professional Letter: Chief Medical Officer - Current vaccine and immunization issues| volume=1| page=4| year=2001| publisher=Department of Health| url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/dr_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_4013404.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=2009-11-07}}</ref>

Those lacking a functional spleen are at higher risk of contracting [[malaria]],<ref name="pmid7496237">{{cite journal |author=Boone KE, Watters DA |title=The incidence of malaria after splenectomy in Papua New Guinea |journal=BMJ |volume=311 |issue=7015 |pages=1273 |year=1995 |month=November |pmid=7496237 |pmc=2551185 |doi= |url=}}</ref> and succumbing to its effects. Travel to malarial areas will carry greater risks and is best avoided. Travellers should take the most appropriate anti-malarial prophylaxis medication and be extra vigilant over measures to prevent mosquito bites.<ref name="BMJ1996"/>

The pneumococcal vaccinations may not cover some of the other strains of pneumococcal bacteria present in other countries. Likewise their antibiotic resistance may also vary, requiring a different choice of stand-by antibiotic.

===Additional measures===
* ''Surgical and dental procedures'' - Antibiotic prophylaxis may be required before certain surgical or dental procedures.
* ''Animal bites'' - adequate antibiotic cover is required after even minor dog or other animal bites. Asplenic patients are particularly susceptible to infection by [[capnocytophaga canimorsus]] and should receive a five-day course of [[amoxicillin/clavulanate]] ([[erythromycin]] in patients allergic to penicillin).<!--

* ''Tick bites'' - ''[[Babesiosis]]'' is a rare tickborne infection. Patients should check themselves or have themselves inspected for tick bites if they are in an at-risk situation. Presentation with fever, fatigue, and haemolytic anaemia requires diagnostic confirmation by identifying the parasites within red blood cells on blood film and by specific [[serology]]. [[Quinine]] (with or without [[clindamycin]]) is usually an effective treatment.<!--
  --><ref name="SHB2002-measures"/>
* ''Alert warning'' - People without a working spleen can carry a card, or wear a [[Medical alert jewelry|special bracelet or necklet]] which says that they do not have a working spleen. This would alert a healthcare professional to take rapid action if they become are seriously ill and cannot notify them of their condition.
