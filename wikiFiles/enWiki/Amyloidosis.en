In [[medicine]], '''amyloidosis''' refers to a variety of conditions wherein normally soluble [[protein]]s become [[insoluble]] and are deposited in the [[extracellular space]] of various [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s or [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s, disrupting normal function.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Vinay|title=Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease|year=2009|publisher=Saunders|isbn=1416031219}}</ref> The insoluble fibrous protein aggregates that develop in amyloidosis are known as [[amyloid]]s.

==Classification of amyloid==

The modern classification of amyloid disease tends to use an abbreviation of the protein that makes the majority of deposits, prefixed with the letter A. For example, amyloidosis caused by [[transthyretin]] is termed "ATTR". Deposition patterns vary between patients but are almost always composed of just one amyloidogenic protein. Deposition can be [[Systemic disease|systemic]] (affecting many different organ systems) or organ-specific. Many amyloidoses are [[genetic disorder|inherited]], due to [[mutations]] in the precursor protein. 

Other forms are due to different diseases causing overabundant or abnormal protein production - such as with overproduction of [[immunoglobulin light chains]] in [[multiple myeloma]] (termed [[AL amyloidosis]]), or with continuous overproduction of [[acute phase protein]]s in [[chronic inflammation]] (which can lead to [[AA amyloidosis]]).

Out of the approximately 60 amyloid proteins that have been identified so far,<ref name="pmid17223074">{{cite journal |author=Mok KH, Pettersson J, Orrenius S, Svanborg C |title=HAMLET, protein folding, and tumor cell death |journal=Biochem.

==Pathogenesis==
Native cells have two different methods of making different proteins. For some proteins cells make the whole protein in one piece; for other proteins cells only make protein fragments, and the fragments come and join together to form the whole protein. But such a protein can sometimes fall apart into the original protein fragments. This process of "flip flopping" happens frequently for certain protein types, especially the ones that cause amyloidosis. 

The fragments or actual proteins are at risk of [[Protein#Structure|mis-folding]] as they are synthesized, to make a bad protein. This causes [[proteolysis]], which is the directed degradation of proteins by cellular [[enzyme]]s called [[protease]]s or by intramolecular digestion; proteases come and digest the mis-folded fragments and proteins. The problem occurs when the proteins do not dissolve in proteolysis. This happens because the mis-folded proteins sometimes become robust enough that they are not dissolved by normal proteolysis. When the fragments do not dissolve, they get spit out of proteolysis and they aggregate to form [[oligomer]]s. The reason they aggregate is that the parts of the protein that do not dissolve in proteolysis are the β-pleated sheets, which are extremely [[hydrophobic]]. They are usually sequestered in the middle of the protein, while parts of the protein that are more soluble are found near the outside. When they are exposed to water, these hydrophobic pieces tend to aggregate with other hydrophobic pieces. This ball of fragments gets stabilized by [[Glycosaminoglycan|GAG's (glycosaminoglycans)]] and [[Serum amyloid P component|SAP (serum amyloid P)]], a component found in amyloid aggregations that is thought to stabilize them and prevent proteolytic cleavage). The stabilized balls of protein fragments are called [[oligomers]]. The oligomers can aggregate together and further stabilize to make amyloid fibrils. 

Both the oligomers and amyloid fibrils can cause cell toxicity and organ dysfunction.<ref name="bob">[http://www.springerlink.com/content/j50110/#section=715613&page=1&locus=11], Karp, Judith E., ed. Amyloidosis Diagnosis and Treatment. Rochester: Humana, 2010. Online Source. .</ref>

==Classification==
The names of the amyloid usually start with the letter "A". Following is a brief description of the more common types of amyloid:

As of 2010, there were 27 human and nine animal fibril proteins classified, along with eight [[inclusion bodies]].<ref name="pmid21039326">{{cite journal |author=Sipe JD, Benson MD, Buxbaum JN, ''et al.'' |title=Amyloid fibril protein nomenclature: 2010 recommendations from the nomenclature committee of the International Society of Amyloidosis |journal=Amyloid |volume=17 |issue=3–4 |pages=101–104 |year=2010 |month=September |pmid=21039326 |doi=10.3109/13506129.2010.526812 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/13506129.2010.526812}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
There are numerous symptoms that are associated with this disease. The most common ones have to do with the [[Heart#In_humans|heart]], such as [[heart failure]] and [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|arrhythmia]]. Also, the respiratory tract can be affected and cause [[hemoptysis]]. Usually, the [[spleen]] enlarges and sometimes ruptures. The [[gastrointestinal tract]] is usually affected and causes vomiting, hemorrhaging and diarrhea. Amyloidosis can also affect the body's motor functions and cause [[polyneuropathy]]. 

When the amyloid fibrils and oligomers get to the skin, they can cause skin [[lesions]] and [[petechiae]]. 

One of the most well known symptoms is [[macroglossia]].<ref name="bob" />

==Diagnosis==
If diagnosis of amyloidosis is suspected, a tissue sample of abdominal wall fat, the [[rectum]] or a [[salivary gland]], can be examined in [[biopsy]] for evidence of characteristic amyloid deposits. 

The tissue is treated with various [[Histology#Common laboratory stains|stains]]. The most useful stain in the diagnosis of amyloid is [[Congo red]], which, combined with [[Polarization (waves)|polarized light]], makes the amyloid proteins appear apple-green on [[microscopy]]. Alternatively, [[Thioflavin|thioflavin T]] stain may be used.<ref name=Dember2006>{{cite journal |author=Dember LM |title=Amyloidosis-associated kidney disease |journal=J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. |volume=17 |issue=12 |pages=3458–71 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17093068 |doi=10.1681/ASN.2006050460 |url=http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/17/12/3458.long}}</ref> An abdominal wall fat biopsy is not completely sensitive and, sometimes, biopsy of an involved organ (such as the kidney) is required to achieve a diagnosis.<ref name=Dember2006/>

The nature of the amyloid protein can be determined by various ways: the detection of abnormal proteins in the bloodstream (on [[protein electrophoresis]] or light chain determination), binding of particular antibodies to the amyloid found in the tissue, or extraction of the protein and identification of its individual [[amino acid]]s.<ref name=Dember2006/>

==Alternative classifications==
An older, clinical, method of classification refers to amyloidoses as '''systemic''' or '''localised'''
* '''Systemic''' amyloidoses affect more than one body organ or system. Examples are: AL, AA and Aβ2m.<ref name=Kumar5-12>Table 5-12 in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= 2007|pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.</ref>

* '''Localised''' amyloidoses affect only one body organ or tissue type. Examples are: [[Aβ]], [[Amylin|IAPP]], [[Atrial natriuretic factor]] (in [[isolated atrial amyloidosis]]) and [[Calcitonin]] (in [[medullary carcinoma of the thyroid]])<ref name=Kumar5-12/>

Another classification is '''primary''' or '''secondary'''.
* [[primary amyloidosis|'''Primary''' amyloidoses]] arise from a disease with disordered immune cell function such as [[multiple myeloma]] and other immunocyte dyscrasias.

* '''Secondary''' (reactive) amyloidoses are those occurring as a complication of some other chronic inflammatory or tissue destructive disease. Examples are [[reactive systemic amyloidosis]] and [[secondary cutaneous amyloidosis]].<ref name=Kumar5-12/>
