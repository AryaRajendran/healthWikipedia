'''Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci''' ({{IPA-it|leoˈnardo da ˈvintʃi}} {{Audio|it-Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci.ogg|pronunciation}}) (April 15, 1452&nbsp;– May 2, 1519, [[Old Style]]) was an [[Italian Renaissance]] [[polymath]]: painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, [[cartographer]], [[botanist]], and writer. His [[genius]], perhaps more than that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal.<!-- NOTE The following paragraph is about HISTORIC OPINION not POV. It does not contravene Wiki policy, even though it uses words like "archetype", "greatest" and "most". It states how Leonardo has been DESCRIBED and CONSIDERED for 500 years. It cites 8 references which make these statements. -->
Leonardo has often been described as the archetype of the [[Polymath|Renaissance Man]], a man of "unquenchable curiosity" and "feverishly inventive imagination".<ref name=HG>{{Cite book|first=Helen|last=Gardner|title=Art through the Ages|year=1970|pages= 450–456}}</ref> He is widely considered to be one of the [[greatness|greatest]] painters of all time and perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived.<ref name=genius>Vasari, Boltraffio, Castiglione, "Anonimo" Gaddiano, Berensen, Taine, Fuseli, Rio, Bortolon.</ref> According to art historian [[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]], the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent and "his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, the man himself mysterious and remote".<ref name=HG/> Marco Rosci states that while there is much speculation about Leonardo, his vision of the world is essentially logical rather than mysterious, and that the empirical methods he employed were unusual for his time.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Marco|last=Rosci|title=Leonardo|year=1977|page= 8}}</ref>

Born [[out of wedlock]] to a [[notary]], Piero da Vinci, and a peasant woman, Caterina, at [[Vinci, Italy|Vinci]] in the region of [[Florence]], Leonardo was educated in the studio of the renowned Florentine painter, [[Verrocchio]]. Much of his earlier working life was spent in the service of [[Ludovico il Moro]] in [[Milan]]. He later worked in [[Rome]], [[Bologna]] and [[Venice]], and he spent his last years in France at the home awarded him by [[Francis I of France|Francis&nbsp;I]].

Leonardo was, and is, renowned<ref name=genius/> primarily as a painter. Among his works, the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' is the most famous and most parodied portrait<ref>John Lichfield, ''[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-moving-of-the-mona-lisa-6149165.html The Moving of the Mona Lisa]'', The Independent, 2005-04-02 (accessed 2012-03-09)</ref> and ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'' the most reproduced religious painting of all time, with their fame approached only by [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Creation of Adam]]''.<ref name=HG/> Leonardo's drawing of the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' is also regarded as a [[cultural icon]],<ref>Vitruvian Man is referred to as "iconic" at the following websites and many others:[http://www.italian-renaissance-art.com/Vitruvian-Man.html Vitruvian Man], [http://artpassions.com/art/1109-Fine-Art-Classics/0000067329-Leonardo-Da-Vinci-Vitruvian-Man.html Fine Art Classics], [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=403230&sectioncode=26 Key Images in the History of Science]; [http://www.ingenious.org.uk/read/identity/bodyimage/Curiosityanddifference/ Curiosity and difference]; [http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2006/aug/30/art1 The Guardian: The Real da Vinci Code]</ref> being reproduced on items as varied as the euro, textbooks, and T-shirts. Perhaps fifteen of his paintings survive, the small number because of his constant, and frequently disastrous, experimentation with new techniques, and his chronic procrastination.<ref group="nb">There are 15 significant artworks which are ascribed, either in whole or in large part, to Leonardo by most art historians. This number is made up principally of paintings on panel but includes a mural, a large drawing on paper and two works which are in the early stages of preparation. There are a number of other works that have also been variously attributed to Leonardo.</ref> Nevertheless, these few works, together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting, compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary, [[Michelangelo]].

Leonardo is revered<ref name=genius/> for his technological ingenuity. He conceptualised a [[helicopter]], a [[tank]], concentrated [[solar energy|solar power]], a calculator,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://192.220.96.166/leonardo/leonardo.html|title=The Controversial Replica of Leonardo's Adding Machine|publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-12-22}}</ref> and the [[double hull]], and he outlined a rudimentary theory of [[plate tectonics]]. Relatively few of his designs were constructed or were even feasible during his lifetime,<ref group="nb">Modern scientific approaches to [[metallurgy]] and engineering were only in their infancy during the Renaissance.</ref> but some of his smaller inventions, such as an automated [[bobbin]] winder and a machine for testing the [[tensile strength]] of wire, entered the world of manufacturing unheralded.<ref group="nb">A number of Leonardo's most practical inventions are displayed as working models at the Museum of Vinci.</ref> He made important discoveries in [[anatomy]], [[civil engineering]], [[optics]], and [[fluid dynamics|hydrodynamics]], but he did not publish his findings and they had no direct influence on later science.<ref>Capra, pp.5–6</ref>

Leonardo was born on April 15, 1452 (Old Style), "at the third hour of the night"{{#tag:ref|His birth is recorded in the diary of his paternal grandfather Ser Antonio, as cited by Angela Ottino della Chiesa in ''Leonardo da Vinci'', and Reynal & Co., ''Leonardo da Vinci'' (William Morrow and Company, 1956): "A grandson of mine was born April 15, Saturday, three hours into the night". The date was recorded in the Julian calendar; as it was Florentine time and sunset was 6:40 pm, three hours after sunset would be sometime around 9:40 pm which was still April 14 by modern reckoning. The conversion to the New Style calendar adds nine days; hence Leonardo was born April 23 according to the modern calendar.<ref name=AV/>|group="nb"}} in the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] hill town of [[Vinci, Italy|Vinci]], in the lower valley of the [[Arno River]] in the territory of the [[Medici]]-ruled [[Republic of Florence]].<ref name= SerA>His birth is recorded in the diary of his paternal grandfather Ser Antonio, as cited by Angela Ottino della Chiesa in ''Leonardo da Vinci'', p. 83</ref> He was the [[out-of-wedlock]] son of the wealthy Messer Piero Fruosino di Antonio da Vinci, a Florentine [[Civil law notary|legal notary]], and Caterina, a peasant.<ref name=AV>{{Cite book|first=Alessandro|last=Vezzosi|title=Leonardo da Vinci: Renaissance Man|year=1997}}</ref><ref name=Chiesa83>{{Cite book|first=Angela Ottino|last=della Chiesa|title=The Complete Paintings of Leonardo da Vinci|year=1967|page=83}}</ref><ref group="nb">It has been suggested that Caterina may have been a slave from the Middle East "or at least, from the Mediterranean". According to Alessandro Vezzosi, head of the Leonardo Museum in Vinci, there is evidence that Piero owned a Middle Eastern slave called Caterina. That Leonardo had Middle Eastern blood is claimed to be supported by the reconstruction of a fingerprint as reported by {{Cite news|first=Marta|last=Falconi|agency= Associated Press|publisher=Fox|place=USA|url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Dec01/0,4670,LeonardoapossFingerprint,00.html|title=Experts Reconstruct Leonardo Fingerprint|date=December 12, 2006 |accessdate=2010-01-06|edition=News|origyear=2006-12-1}}. The evidence, as stated in the article, is that 60% of people of Middle Eastern origin share the pattern of whirls found on the reconstructed fingerprint. The article also states that the claim is refuted by Simon Cole, associate professor of criminology, law and society at the University of California at Irvine: "You can't predict one person's race from these kinds of incidences, especially if looking at only one finger."</ref> Leonardo had no surname in the modern sense, "da Vinci" simply meaning "of Vinci": his full birth name was "Lionardo di ser Piero da Vinci", meaning "Leonardo, (son) of (Mes)ser Piero from Vinci".<ref name=SerA/> The inclusion of the title "ser" indicated that Leonardo's father was a gentleman.

Little is known about Leonardo's early life. He spent his first five years in the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Anchiano]] in the home of his mother, then from 1457 he lived in the household of his father, grandparents and uncle, Francesco, in the small town of Vinci. His father had married a sixteen-year-old girl named Albiera, who loved Leonardo but died young.<ref name="LB">{{Cite book| first = Liana|last = Bortolon|title=The Life and Times of Leonardo|publisher=Paul Hamlyn|publication-place=London|year=1967}}</ref> When Leonardo was sixteen his father married again, to twenty-year-old Francesca Lanfredini. It was not until his third and fourth marriages that Ser Piero produced legitimate heirs.<ref>Rosci, p. 20.</ref>

Leonardo received an informal education in Latin, geometry and mathematics. In later life, Leonardo recorded only two childhood incidents. One, which he regarded as an omen, was when a [[Kite (bird)|kite]] dropped from the sky and hovered over his cradle, its tail feathers brushing his face.<ref>Rosci, p. 21.</ref> The second occurred while exploring in the mountains. He discovered a cave and was both terrified that some great monster might lurk there and driven by curiosity to find out what was inside.<ref name=LB/>

Leonardo's early life has been the subject of historical conjecture.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brigstoke|first=Hugh|title=The Oxford Companion the Western Art|location=Oxford, ENG, UK|year= 2001}}</ref> [[Vasari]], the 16th-century biographer of Renaissance painters, tells of how a local peasant made himself a round shield and requested that Ser Piero have it painted for him. Leonardo responded with a painting of a monster spitting fire which was so terrifying that Ser Piero sold it to a Florentine art dealer, who sold it to the [[Duke of Milan]]. Meanwhile, having made a profit, Ser Piero bought a shield decorated with a heart pierced by an arrow, which he gave to the peasant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vasari|first=Giorgio|title=Lives of the Artists|year=1568|publisher= Penguin Classics|pages=258–9}}</ref>

===Verrocchio's workshop, 1466–76===
In 1466, at the age of fourteen, Leonardo was apprenticed to the artist Andrea di Cione, known as [[Verrocchio]], whose workshop was "one of the finest in Florence".<ref name="Rosci">Rosci, p.13</ref> Other famous painters apprenticed or associated with the workshop include [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], [[Perugino]], [[Botticelli]], and [[Lorenzo di Credi]].<ref name=LB/><ref name=DA/> Leonardo would have been exposed to both theoretical training and a vast range of technical skills<ref>Rosci, p.27</ref> including drafting, chemistry, metallurgy, metal working, plaster casting, leather working, mechanics and carpentry as well as the artistic skills of drawing, painting, sculpting and modelling.<ref name=AM>{{Cite book|first=Andrew|last=Martindale|year=1972|title=The Rise of the Artist}}</ref><ref group="nb">The "diverse arts" and technical skills of Medieval and Renaissance workshops are described in detail in the 12th century text ''On Divers Arts'' by [[Theophilus Presbyter]] and in the early 15th century text ''Il Libro Dell'arte O Trattato Della Pittui '' by [[Cennino Cennini]].</ref>

Much of the painted production of Verrocchio's workshop was done by his employees. According to Vasari, Leonardo collaborated with Verrocchio on his ''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|The Baptism of Christ]]'', painting the young angel holding Jesus' robe in a manner that was so far superior to his master's that Verrocchio put down his brush and never painted again.<ref>Vasari, p.258</ref> On close examination, the painting reveals much that has been painted or touched up over the [[tempera]] using the new technique of [[oil painting|oil paint]], with the landscape, the rocks that can be seen through the brown mountain stream and much of the figure of Jesus bearing witness to the hand of Leonardo.<ref>della Chiesa, p.88</ref> Leonardo may have been the model for two works by Verrocchio: the bronze statue of ''[[David (Verrocchio)|David]]'' in the [[Bargello]] and the [[Archangel Raphael]] in ''[[Tobias and the Angel (Verrocchio)|Tobias and the Angel]]''.<ref name=Chiesa83/>

By 1472, at the age of twenty, Leonardo qualified as a master in the [[Guild of St Luke]], the guild of artists and doctors of medicine,{{#tag:ref|That Leonardo joined the guild before this time is deduced from the record of payment made to the Compagnia di San Luca in the company's register, Libro Rosso A, 1472–1520, Accademia di Belle Arti.<ref name=Chiesa83/>|group="nb"}} but even after his father set him up in his own workshop, his attachment to Verrocchio was such that he continued to collaborate with him.<ref name=LB/> Leonardo's earliest known dated work is a drawing in pen and ink of the [[Arno]] valley, drawn on August 5, 1473.<ref group="nb">This work is now in the collection of the [[Uffizi]], Drawing No. 8P.</ref><ref name= DA/>

Leonardo was employed on many different projects for Ludovico, including the preparation of floats and pageants for special occasions, designs for a dome for [[Milan Cathedral]] and a model for a huge [[equestrian statue|equestrian monument]] to [[Francesco Sforza]], Ludovico's predecessor. Seventy tons of [[bronze]] were set aside for casting it. The monument remained unfinished for several years, which was not unusual for Leonardo. In 1492 the clay model of the horse was completed. It surpassed in size the only two large equestrian statues of the Renaissance, Donatello's ''[[Equestrian statue of Gattamelata|Gattemelata]]'' in Padua and Verrocchio's ''[[Bartolomeo Colleoni]]'' in Venice, and became known as the "Gran Cavallo".<ref name=DA/><ref group="nb">Verrocchio's statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni was not cast until 1488, after his death, and after Leonardo had already begun work on the statue for Ludovico.</ref> Leonardo began making detailed plans for its casting;<ref name=DA/> however, Michelangelo insulted Leonardo by implying that he was unable to cast it.<ref name=LB/> In November 1494 Ludovico gave the bronze to be used for cannon to defend the city from invasion by [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]].<ref name=DA/>

[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - Plan of Imola - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|Leonardo da Vinci's very accurate map of Imola, created for Cesare Borgia]]

In [[Cesena]], in 1502 Leonardo entered the service of [[Cesare Borgia]], the son of [[Pope Alexander VI]], acting as a military architect and engineer and travelling throughout Italy with his patron.<ref name=Chiesa85/> Leonardo created a map of Cesare Borgia's stronghold, a town plan of [[Imola]] in order to win his patronage. Maps were extremely rare at the time and it would have seemed like a new concept; upon seeing it, Cesare hired Leonardo as his chief [[military engineer]] and architect. Later in the year, Leonardo produced another map for his patron, one of [[Chiana Valley]], Tuscany so as to give his patron a better overlay of the land and greater strategic position. He created this map in conjunction with his other project of constructing a dam from the sea to Florence in order to allow a supply of water to sustain the canal during all seasons.

Leonardo returned to Florence where he rejoined the Guild of St Luke on October 18, 1503, and spent two years designing and painting a mural of ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|The Battle of Anghiari]]'' for the Signoria,<ref name=Chiesa85/> with Michelangelo designing its companion piece, ''[[Battle of Cascina (Michelangelo)|The Battle of Cascina]]''.{{#tag:ref|Both works are lost.

In 1506 Leonardo returned to Milan.

Leonardo died at [[Clos Lucé]], on May 2, 1519. Francis I had become a close friend. Vasari records that the king held Leonardo's head in his arms as he died, although this story, beloved by the French and portrayed in romantic paintings by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[:File:DeathOfLeonardo.jpg|Ménageot]] and other French artists, as well as by [[Angelica Kauffmann]], may be legend rather than fact.<ref group="nb">On the day of Leonardo's death, a royal edict was issued by the king at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], a two-day journey from [[Clos Lucé]].

Florence, at the time of Leonardo's youth, was the centre of Christian [[Renaissance humanism|Humanist]] thought and culture.<ref name="Rosci" /> Leonardo commenced his [[apprenticeship]] with Verrocchio in 1466, the year that Verrocchio's master, the great sculptor [[Donatello]], died. The painter [[Uccello]], whose early experiments with perspective were to influence the development of landscape painting, was a very old man. The painters [[Piero della Francesca]] and [[Fra Filippo Lippi]], sculptor [[Luca della Robbia]], and architect and writer [[Leon Battista Alberti]] were in their sixties. The successful artists of the next generation were Leonardo's teacher Verrocchio, [[Antonio Pollaiuolo]] and the portrait sculptor, [[Mino da Fiesole]] whose lifelike busts give the most reliable likenesses of Lorenzo Medici's father Piero and uncle Giovanni.<ref name=Hartt>{{Cite book| first=Frederich|last=Hartt|title=A History of Italian Renaissance Art|year=1970|pages=127–333}}</ref><ref name=Rosci1>Rosci, ''Leonardo'', chapter 1, ''the historical setting'', pp.9–20</ref><ref name=Bruck/><ref name=Rach/>

Leonardo's youth was spent in a Florence that was ornamented by the works of these artists and by Donatello's contemporaries, [[Masaccio]], whose figurative [[fresco]]es were imbued with realism and emotion and [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]] whose ''[[Florence Baptistery#Lorenzo Ghiberti|Gates of Paradise]]'', gleaming with [[gold leaf]], displayed the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of perspective,<ref>Piero della Francesca, ''On Perspective for Painting (De Prospectiva Pingendi)''</ref> and was the first painter to make a scientific study of light. These studies and [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti's]] Treatise<ref>Leon Battista Alberti, ''De Pictura'', 1435. [http://www.noteaccess.com/Texts/Alberti/ ''On Painting'', in English], [http://www.liberliber.it/biblioteca/a/alberti/de_pictura/html/depictur.htm ''De Pictura'', in Latin]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> were to have a profound effect on younger artists and in particular on Leonardo's own observations and artworks.<ref name=Hartt/><ref name=Bruck/><ref name=Rach/>

Massaccio's "[[The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden]]" depicting the naked and distraught [[Adam and Eve]] created a powerfully expressive image of the human form, cast into three dimensions by the use of [[chiaroscuro|light and shade]] which was to be developed in the works of Leonardo in a way that was to be influential in the course of painting. The humanist influence of Donatello's "David" can be seen in Leonardo's late paintings, particularly ''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|John the Baptist]]''.<ref name=Hartt/><ref name= Rosci1/>

[[File:1 Workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio (Botticini) 1460s Metropolitan Museum N-Y.jpg|thumb|upright|Small devotional picture by Verrocchio, c. 1470]]

A prevalent tradition in Florence was the small altarpiece of the [[Madonna (art)|Virgin and Child]]. Many of these were created in [[tempera]] or glazed [[terracotta]] by the workshops of Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio and the prolific [[Luca della Robbia|della Robbia]] family.<ref name=Hartt/> Leonardo's early Madonnas such as ''[[Madonna of the Carnation|The Madonna with a carnation]]'' and ''[[The Benois Madonna]]'' followed this tradition while showing idiosyncratic departures, particularly in the case of the Benois Madonna in which the Virgin is set at an oblique angle to the picture space with the Christ Child at the opposite angle. This compositional theme was to emerge in Leonardo's later paintings such as ''The [[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne (Leonardo da Vinci)|Virgin and Child with St. Anne]]''.<ref name=LB/>

Leonardo was a contemporary of [[Botticelli]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Perugino]], who were all slightly older than he was.<ref name=Rosci1/> He would have met them at the workshop of Verrocchio, with whom they had associations, and at the [[Academy#Modern use of the term academy|Academy]] of the [[Medici]].<ref name=LB/> Botticelli was a particular favourite of the Medici family, and thus his success as a painter was assured. Ghirlandaio and Perugino were both prolific and ran large workshops. They competently delivered commissions to well-satisfied patrons who appreciated Ghirlandaio's ability to portray the wealthy citizens of Florence within large religious frescoes, and Perugino's ability to deliver a multitude of saints and angels of unfailing sweetness and innocence.<ref name=Hartt/> [[File:Hugo van der Goes 006.jpg|thumb|left|''The Portinari Altarpiece'', by [[Hugo van der Goes]] for a Florentine family]] These three were among those commissioned to paint the walls of the [[Sistine Chapel]], the work commencing with Perugino's employment in 1479. Leonardo was not part of this prestigious commission. His first significant commission, The ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' for the Monks of Scopeto, was never completed.<ref name=LB/>

In 1476, during the time of Leonardo's association with Verrocchio's workshop, the [[Portinari Altarpiece]] by [[Hugo van der Goes]] arrived in Florence, bringing [[Early Netherlandish painting|new painterly techniques]] from Northern Europe which were to profoundly affect Leonardo, Ghirlandaio, Perugino and others.<ref name=Rosci1/> In 1479, the Sicilian painter [[Antonello da Messina]], who worked exclusively in oils, traveled north on his way to [[Venice]], where the leading painter [[Giovanni Bellini]] adopted the technique of [[oil painting]], quickly making it the preferred method in Venice. Leonardo was also later to visit Venice.<ref name=Rosci1/><ref name=Rach/>

Like the two contemporary architects [[Bramante]] and [[Antonio da Sangallo the Elder]] Leonardo experimented with designs for centrally planned churches, a number of which appear in his journals, as both plans and views, although none was ever realised.<ref name=Rosci1/><ref>Hartt, pp.391–2</ref>

[[File:Ghirlandaio a-pucci-lorenzo-de-medici-f-sassetti 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Lorenzo de' Medici between Antonio Pucci and Francesco Sassetti, with Giulio de' Medici, fresco by Ghirlandaio]] Leonardo's political contemporaries were [[Lorenzo Medici]] (il Magnifico), who was three years older, and his younger brother Giuliano who was slain in the [[Pazzi Conspiracy]] in 1478. [[Ludovico il Moro]] who ruled [[Milan]] between 1479–1499 and to whom Leonardo was sent as ambassador from the Medici court, was also of Leonardo's age.<ref name=Rosci1/>

With Alberti, Leonardo visited the home of the Medici and through them came to know the older Humanist philosophers of whom [[Marsiglio Ficino]], proponent of [[Neo Platonism]]; [[Cristoforo Landino]], writer of commentaries on Classical writings, and [[John Argyropoulos]], teacher of Greek and translator of [[Aristotle]] were the foremost. Also associated with the Academy of the Medici was Leonardo's contemporary, the brilliant young poet and philosopher [[Pico della Mirandola]].<ref name=Rosci1/><ref name=Rach/><ref>{{Cite book|first=Hugh Ross|last=Williamson|title=Lorenzo the Magnificent|year=1974}}</ref> Leonardo later wrote in the margin of a journal "The Medici made me and the Medici destroyed me." While it was through the action of Lorenzo that Leonardo received his employment at the court of Milan, it is not known exactly what Leonardo meant by this cryptic comment.<ref name=LB/>

Although usually named together as the three giants of the [[High Renaissance]], Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael were not of the same generation. Leonardo was twenty-three when Michelangelo was born and thirty-one when Raphael was born.<ref name=Rosci1/> Raphael only lived until the age of 37 and died in 1520, the year after Leonardo, but Michelangelo went on creating for another 45 years.<ref name=Bruck>{{Cite book|first=Gene A.|last=Brucker|title=Renaissance Florence|year=1969}}</ref><ref name=Rach>{{Cite book|first=Ilan|last=Rachum|title=The Renaissance, an Illustrated Encyclopedia|year=1979}}</ref>

===Personal life===
{{Main|Leonardo da Vinci's personal life}}

Within Leonardo's lifetime, his extraordinary powers of invention, his "outstanding physical beauty", "infinite grace", "great strength and generosity", "regal spirit and tremendous breadth of mind" as described by Vasari,<ref>Vasari, p.253</ref> as well as all other aspects of his life, attracted the curiosity of others. One such aspect is his respect for life evidenced by his vegetarianism and his habit, according to Vasari, of purchasing caged birds and releasing them.<ref>Vasari, p.257</ref><ref>Eugene Muntz, ''Leonardo da Vinci Artist, Thinker, and Man of Science'' (1898), quoted at [http://www.ivu.org/history/davinci/hurwitz.html Leonardo da Vinci's Ethical Vegetarianism]</ref>

Leonardo had many friends who are now renowned either in their fields or for their historical significance. They included the mathematician [[Luca Pacioli]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Leonardo_Master_Draftsman/draftsman_left_essay.asp|title=Leonardo, Left-Handed Draftsman and Writer|accessdate=2009-10-18|last=Bambach|first=Carmen|year= 2003|location=New York|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091110221047/http://www.metmuseum.org/special/leonardo_master_draftsman/draftsman_left_essay.asp <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=November 10, 2009}}</ref> with whom he collaborated on the book ''[[De divina proportione|De Divina Proportione]]'' in the 1490s, as well as [[Niccolò Machiavelli]],  [[Cesare Borgia]], [[Franchinus Gaffurius]] and [[Isabella d'Este]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Leonardo appears to have had no close relationships with women except for his friendship with [[Cecilia Gallerani]] and the two Este sisters, [[Beatrice d'Este|Beatrice]] and Isabella.<ref>Cartwright Ady, Julia.

Dent, 1903.</ref> He drew a portrait of Isabella while on a journey which took him through [[Mantua]], and which appears to have been used to create a painted portrait, now lost.<ref name=LB/>

Beyond friendship, Leonardo kept his private life secret. His sexuality has been the subject of satire, analysis, and speculation. This trend began in the mid-16th century and was revived in the 19th and 20th centuries, most notably by [[Sigmund Freud]].<ref>Sigmund Freud, ''Eine Kindheitserinnerung des Leonardo da Vinci'', (1910)</ref> Leonardo's most intimate relationships were perhaps with his pupils Salai and Melzi. Melzi, writing to inform Leonardo's brothers of his death, described Leonardo's feelings for his pupils as both loving and passionate.
It has been claimed since the 16th century that these relationships were of a sexual or erotic nature. Court records of 1476, when he was aged twenty-four, show that Leonardo and three other young men were charged with [[sodomy]] in an incident involving a well-known male prostitute. The charges were dismissed for lack of evidence, and there is speculation that since one of the accused, Lionardo de Tornabuoni, was related to [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], the family exerted its influence to secure the dismissal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bnl.gov/bera/activities/globe/leonardo_da_vinci.htm |title=How do we know Leonardo was gay?|publisher=Bnl.gov |date=2001-05-03 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> Since that date much has been written about his presumed homosexuality and its role in his art, particularly in the androgyny and eroticism manifested in ''John the Baptist'' and ''Bacchus'' and more explicitly in a number of erotic drawings.<ref>Michael Rocke, ''Forbidden Friendships'' epigraph, p. 148 & N120 p.298</ref> <!-- The info contained here is beyond dispute.

===Assistants and pupils===
[[Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno]], nicknamed ''Salai'' or ''Il Salaino'' ("The Little Unclean One" i.e., the devil), entered Leonardo's household in 1490. After only a year, Leonardo made a list of his misdemeanours, calling him "a thief, a liar, stubborn, and a glutton", after he had made off with money and valuables on at least five occasions and spent a fortune on clothes.<ref>Leonardo, Codex C. 15v, Institut of France. Trans. Richter</ref> Nevertheless, Leonardo treated him with great indulgence, and he remained in Leonardo's household for the next thirty years.<ref>della Chiesa, p.84</ref> Salai executed a number of paintings under the name of Andrea Salai, but although Vasari claims that Leonardo "taught him a great deal about painting",<ref name="Vasari, p.265"/> his work is generally considered to be of less artistic merit than others among Leonardo's pupils, such as [[Marco d'Oggione]] and [[Boltraffio]]. In 1515, he painted a nude version of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', known as ''[[Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno#Life|Monna Vanna]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gross|first=Tom|title=Mona Lisa Goes Topless|work= |publisher=Paintingsdirect.com|date= |url= http://www.paintingsdirect.com/content/artnews/032001/artnews1.html|accessdate=2007-09-27 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070403073656/http://www.paintingsdirect.com/content/artnews/032001/artnews1.html |archivedate=2007-04-03}}</ref> Salai owned the ''Mona Lisa'' at the time of his death in 1525, and in his will it was assessed at 505 lire, an exceptionally high valuation for a small panel portrait.<ref name=NR>{{cite web|last=Rossiter|first=Nick|title=Could this be the secret of her smile?|work= |publisher=Telegraph.co.UK|date=2003-07-04|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/04/07/banr.xml|accessdate=2007-10-03|location=London}}</ref>

In 1506, Leonardo took on another pupil, Count [[Francesco Melzi]], the son of a [[Lombardy|Lombard]] aristocrat, who is considered to have been his favourite student. He travelled to France with Leonardo and remained with him until Leonardo's death.<ref name=LB/> Melzi inherited the artistic and scientific works, manuscripts, and collections of Leonardo and administered the estate.

[[File:Leonardo Da Vinci - Annunciazione.jpeg|thumb|400px|''[[Annunciation (Leonardo)|Annunciation]]'' (1475–1480)—Uffizi, is thought to be Leonardo's earliest complete work.]]
Despite the recent awareness and admiration of Leonardo as a scientist and inventor, for the better part of four hundred years his fame rested on his achievements as a painter and on a handful of works, either authenticated or attributed to him that have been regarded as among the masterpieces.<ref>By the 1490s Leonardo had already been described as a "Divine" painter. His fame is discussed by Daniel Arasse in ''Leonardo da Vinci'', pp.11–15</ref>

These paintings are famous for a variety of qualities which have been much imitated by students and discussed at great length by connoisseurs and critics. Among the qualities that make Leonardo's work unique are the innovative techniques that he used in laying on the paint, his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology, his interest in [[physiognomy]] and the way in which humans register emotion in expression and gesture, his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition, and his use of the subtle gradation of tone. All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, the ''Mona Lisa'', the ''Last Supper'' and the ''Virgin of the Rocks''.<ref>These qualities of Leonardo's works are discussed by Frederick Hartt in ''A History of Italian Renaissance Art'', pp.387–411.</ref>

[[File:Leonardo, san girolamo.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Unfinished painting of ''St. Jerome in the Wilderness'', (c.&nbsp;1480), [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]].]]

===Early works===
Leonardo's early works begin with the ''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|Baptism of Christ]]'' painted in conjunction with Verrocchio. Two other paintings appear to date from his time at the workshop, both of which are [[Annunciation]]s. One is small, {{nowrap|{{convert|59|cm}}}} long and {{nowrap|{{convert|14|cm}}}} high. It is a "predella" to go at the base of a larger composition, in this case a painting by [[Lorenzo di Credi]] from which it has become separated. The other is a much larger work, {{nowrap|{{convert|217|cm}}}} long.<ref>della Chiesa, pp. 88, 90</ref> In both these Annunciations, Leonardo used a formal arrangement, such as in Fra Angelico's two well-known pictures of the same subject, of the [[Virgin Mary]] sitting or kneeling to the right of the picture, approached from the left by an angel in profile with rich flowing garment, raised wings and bearing a lily. Although previously attributed to Ghirlandaio, the larger work is now generally attributed to Leonardo.<ref name=Berti>{{Cite book | first = Luciano | last = Berti | title = The Uffizi | year = 1971 | pages = 59–62}}</ref>

In the smaller picture Mary averts her eyes and folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised submission to God's will. In the larger picture, however, Mary is not submissive. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise.<ref name=Hartt/> This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the [[Mother of God]] not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.{{#tag:ref|Michael Baxandall lists 5 "laudable conditions" or reactions of Mary to the presence and announcement of the angel. These are: Disquiet, Reflection, Inquiry, Submission and Merit. In this painting Mary's attitude does not comply with any of the accepted traditions.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Michael|last=Baxandall|title=Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy|year=1974|pages=49–56}}</ref>|group="nb"}}

===Paintings of the 1480s===
[[File:Virgin of the Rocks.jpg|thumb|''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'', [[Louvre]], demonstrates Leonardo's interest in nature.]]
In the 1480s Leonardo received two very important commissions and commenced another work which was also of ground-breaking importance in terms of composition. Two of the three were never finished, and the third took so long that it was subject to lengthy negotiations over completion and payment. One of these paintings is that of ''[[St. Jerome in the Wilderness]]''. Bortolon associates this picture with a difficult period of Leonardo's life, as evidenced in his diary: "I thought I was learning to live; I was only learning to die."<ref name=LB/>

Although the painting is barely begun, the composition can be seen and it is very unusual.{{#tag:ref|The painting, which in the 18th century belonged to [[Angelica Kauffmann]], was later cut up. The two main sections were found in a junk shop and cobbler's shop and were reunited.<ref name=Wasser2>Wasserman, pp.104–6</ref> It is probable that outer parts of the composition are missing.|group="nb"}} [[St Jerome|Jerome]], as a [[penitent]], occupies the middle of the picture, set on a slight diagonal and viewed somewhat from above. His kneeling form takes on a trapezoid shape, with one arm stretched to the outer edge of the painting and his gaze looking in the opposite direction. J. Wasserman points out the link between this painting and Leonardo's anatomical studies.<ref name=Wasser2/> Across the foreground sprawls his symbol, a great lion whose body and tail make a double spiral across the base of the picture space. The other remarkable feature is the sketchy landscape of craggy rocks against which the figure is silhouetted.

The daring display of figure composition, the landscape elements and personal drama also appear in the great unfinished masterpiece, the ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'', a commission from the Monks of San Donato a Scopeto. It is a complex composition, of about 250 x 250 centimetres. Leonardo did numerous drawings and preparatory studies, including a detailed one in linear perspective of the ruined [[classical architecture]] which makes part of the backdrop to the scene. But in 1482 Leonardo went off to Milan at the behest of [[Lorenzo Medici|Lorenzo de' Medici]] in order to win favour with [[Ludovico il Moro]], and the painting was abandoned.<ref name=Chiesa83/><ref name=Berti/>

The third important work of this period is the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' which was commissioned in Milan for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception. The painting, to be done with the assistance of the [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis|de Predis brothers]], was to fill a large complex altarpiece, already constructed.<ref>Wasserman, p.108</ref> Leonardo chose to paint an apocryphal moment of the infancy of Christ when the infant [[John the Baptist]], in protection of an angel, met the Holy Family on the road to Egypt. In this scene, as painted by Leonardo, John recognizes and worships Jesus as the Christ. The painting demonstrates an eerie beauty as the graceful figures kneel in adoration around the infant Christ in a wild landscape of tumbling rock and whirling water.<ref>{{cite web | title =The Mysterious Virgin | work = | publisher =[[National Gallery, London]] | url =http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collection/features/potm/2006/may/feature1.htm | accessdate = 2007-09-27 }}</ref>
While the painting is quite large, about {{nowrap|200 × 120 centimetres}}, it is not nearly as complex as the painting ordered by the monks of St Donato, having only four figures rather than about fifty and a rocky landscape rather than architectural details. The painting was eventually finished; in fact, two versions of the painting were finished, one which remained at the chapel of the Confraternity and the other which Leonardo carried away to France. But the Brothers did not get their painting, or the de Predis their payment, until the next century.<ref name=DA>{{Cite book | first = Daniel | last = Arasse | title = Leonardo da Vinci | year = 1998 }}</ref><ref name="Chiesa85"/>

[[File:Última Cena - Da Vinci 5.jpg|thumb|left|400px|''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'' (1498)—[[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Convent of Sta. Maria delle Grazie]], Milan, Italy]]

===Paintings of the 1490s===
Leonardo's most famous painting of the 1490s is ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'', painted for the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria della Grazie in Milan. The painting represents the last meal shared by Jesus with his disciples before his capture and death. It shows specifically the moment when Jesus has just said "one of you will betray me". Leonardo tells the story of the consternation that this statement caused to the twelve followers of Jesus.<ref name=DA/>

The novelist [[Matteo Bandello]] observed Leonardo at work and wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk without stopping to eat and then not paint for three or four days at a time.<ref>Wasserman, p.124</ref> This was beyond the comprehension of the [[prior]] of the convent, who hounded him until Leonardo asked Ludovico to intervene. Vasari describes how Leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces of Christ and the traitor Judas, told the Duke that he might be obliged to use the prior as his model.<ref>Vasari, p.263</ref>

When finished, the painting was acclaimed as a masterpiece of design and characterisation,<ref>Vasari, p.262</ref> but it deteriorated rapidly, so that within a hundred years it was described by one viewer as "completely ruined".<ref>della Chiesa, p.97</ref> Leonardo, instead of using the reliable technique of fresco, had used tempera over a ground that was mainly gesso, resulting in a surface which was subject to mold and to flaking.<ref>della Chiesa, p.98</ref> Despite this, the painting has remained one of the most reproduced works of art, countless copies being made in every medium from carpets to cameos.

===Paintings of the 1500s===
[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|''[[Mona Lisa]]'' or ''La Gioconda'' (1503–1505/1507)—[[Louvre]], Paris, France]]
Among the works created by Leonardo in the 16th century is the small portrait known as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' or "la Gioconda", the laughing one. In the present era it is arguably the most famous painting in the world. Its fame rests, in particular, on the elusive smile on the woman's face, its mysterious quality brought about perhaps by the fact that the artist has subtly shadowed the corners of the mouth and eyes so that the exact nature of the smile cannot be determined. The shadowy quality for which the work is renowned came to be called "[[sfumato]]" or Leonardo's smoke. Vasari, who is generally thought to have known the painting only by repute, said that "the smile was so pleasing that it seemed divine rather than human; and those who saw it were amazed to find that it was as alive as the original".<ref>Vasari, p.267</ref>{{#tag:ref|Whether or not Vasari had seen the Mona Lisa is the subject of debate. The opinion that he had ''not'' seen the painting is based mainly on the fact that he describes the Mona Lisa as having eyebrows. Daniel Arasse in ''Leonardo da Vinci'' discusses the possibility that Leonardo may have painted the figure with eyebrows which were subsequently removed. (They were not fashionable in the mid-16th century.)<ref name=DA/> The analysis of high resolution scans made by Pascal Cotte has revealed that the Mona Lisa had eyebrows and eyelashes which have been subsequently removed.<ref>{{cite news| publisher=BBC News |title= The Mona Lisa had brows and lashes | date = October 22, 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7056041.stm | accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref>|group="nb"}}

Other characteristics found in this work are the unadorned dress, in which the eyes and hands have no competition from other details, the dramatic landscape background in which the world seems to be in a state of flux, the subdued colouring and the extremely smooth nature of the painterly technique, employing [[oil paint|oils]], but laid on much like [[tempera]] and blended on the surface so that the brushstrokes are indistinguishable.{{#tag:ref|Jack Wasserman writes of "the inimitable treatment of the surfaces" of this painting.<ref>Wasserman, p.144</ref>|group="nb"}} Vasari expressed the opinion that the manner of painting would make even "the most confident master&nbsp;... despair and lose heart."<ref>Vasari, p.266</ref> The perfect state of preservation and the fact that there is no sign of repair or overpainting is rare in a panel painting of this date.<ref>della Chiesa, p.103</ref>

In the painting ''[[Virgin and Child with St. Anne]]'' the composition again picks up the theme of figures in a landscape which Wasserman describes as "breathtakingly beautiful"<ref>Wasserman, p.150</ref> and harkens back to the St Jerome picture with the figure set at an oblique angle. What makes this painting unusual is that there are two obliquely set figures superimposed. Mary is seated on the knee of her mother, St Anne. She leans forward to restrain the Christ Child as he plays roughly with a lamb, the sign of his own impending sacrifice.<ref name=DA/> This painting, which was copied many times, influenced Michelangelo, Raphael, and [[Andrea del Sarto]],<ref>della Chiesa, p.109</ref> and through them [[Pontormo]] and [[Correggio]]. The trends in composition were adopted in particular by the Venetian painters [[Tintoretto]] and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]].

===Drawings===
Leonardo was not a prolific painter, but he was a most prolific draftsman, keeping journals full of small sketches and detailed drawings recording all manner of things that took his attention. As well as the journals there exist many studies for paintings, some of which can be identified as preparatory to particular works such as ''The Adoration of the Magi'', ''The Virgin of the Rocks'' and ''The Last Supper''.<ref name=Popham/>
His earliest dated drawing is a ''Landscape of the Arno Valley'', 1473, which shows the river, the mountains, Montelupo Castle and the farmlands beyond it in great detail.<ref name=LB/><ref name=Popham>{{Cite book | first = A.E. | last = Popham | title = The Drawings of Leonardo da Vinci
 | year = 1946 }}</ref>

Among his famous drawings are the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', a study of the proportions of the human body, the ''Head of an Angel'', for ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'' in the Louvre, a botanical study of ''Star of Bethlehem'' and a large drawing (160×100&nbsp;cm) in black chalk on coloured paper of ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist]]'' in the National Gallery, London.<ref name=Popham/> This drawing employs the subtle ''[[sfumato]]'' technique of shading, in the manner of the ''Mona Lisa''. It is thought that Leonardo never made a painting from it, the closest similarity being to ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Virgin and Child with St. Anne]]'' in the Louvre.<ref>della Chiesa, p.102</ref>

Other drawings of interest include numerous studies generally referred to as "caricatures" because, although exaggerated, they appear to be based upon observation of live models. Vasari relates that if Leonardo saw a person with an interesting face he would follow them around all day observing them.<ref>Vasari, p.261</ref> There are numerous studies of beautiful young men, often associated with Salai, with the rare and much admired facial feature, the so-called "Grecian profile".<ref group = "nb">The "Grecian profile" has a continuous straight line from forehead to nose-tip, the bridge of the nose being exceptionally high. It is a feature of many [[Ancient Greek sculpture|Classical Greek]] statues.</ref> These faces are often contrasted with that of a warrior.<ref name=Popham/> Salai is often depicted in fancy-dress costume. Leonardo is known to have designed sets for pageants with which these may be associated. Other, often meticulous, drawings show studies of drapery. A marked development in Leonardo's ability to draw drapery occurred in his early works. Another often-reproduced drawing is a macabre sketch that was done by Leonardo in Florence in 1479 showing the body of Bernardo Baroncelli, hanged in connection with the murder of Giuliano, brother of Lorenzo de' Medici, in the [[Pazzi Conspiracy]].<ref name=Popham/> With dispassionate integrity Leonardo has registered in neat [[mirror writing]] the colours of the robes that Baroncelli was wearing when he died.

===Journals and notes===
{{See also|List of works by Leonardo da Vinci#Manuscripts}}

[[Renaissance humanism]] recognized no mutually exclusive polarities between the sciences and the arts, and Leonardo's studies in science and engineering are as impressive and innovative as his artistic work.<ref name=DA/> These studies were recorded in 13,000 pages of notes and drawings, which fuse art and [[natural philosophy]] (the forerunner of modern science), made and maintained daily throughout Leonardo's life and travels, as he made continual observations of the world around him.<ref name=DA/>

Leonardo's writings are mostly in mirror-image cursive. The reason may have been more a practical expediency than for reasons of secrecy as is often suggested. Since Leonardo wrote with his left hand, it is probable that it was easier for him to write from right to left.<ref group = "nb">Left-handed writers using a split nib or quill pen experience difficulty pushing the pen from left to right across the page.</ref> [[File:Da Vinci Studies of Embryos Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|left|A page showing Leonardo's study of a foetus in the womb (c.&nbsp;1510) Royal Library, [[Windsor Castle]]]]
His notes and drawings display an enormous range of interests and preoccupations, some as mundane as lists of groceries and people who owed him money and some as intriguing as designs for wings and shoes for walking on water. There are compositions for paintings, studies of details and drapery, studies of faces and emotions, of animals, babies, dissections, plant studies, rock formations, whirlpools, war machines, helicopters and architecture.<ref name=DA/>

These notebooks—originally loose papers of different types and sizes, distributed by friends after his death—have found their way into major collections such as the Royal Library at [[Windsor Castle]], [[the Louvre]], the [[Biblioteca Nacional de España]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]] in Milan which holds the twelve-volume [[Codex Atlanticus]], and [[British Library]] in London which has put a selection from the [[Codex Arundel]] (BL Arundel MS 263) online.<ref>{{cite web | title =Sketches by Leonardo | work =Turning the Pages | publisher =[[British Library]] | url =http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/ttp/ttpbooks.html | accessdate =2007-09-27 }}</ref> The ''[[Codex Leicester (Leonardo da Vinci)|Codex Leicester]]'' is the only major scientific work of Leonardo's in private hands. It is owned by [[Bill Gates]] and is displayed once a year in different cities around the world.

Leonardo's notes appear to have been intended for publication because many of the sheets have a form and order that would facilitate this. In many cases a single topic, for example, the heart or the human fetus, is covered in detail in both words and pictures on a single sheet.<ref>Windsor Castle, Royal Library, sheets RL 19073v-19074v and RL 19102 respectively.</ref><ref group = "nb">This method of organisation minimises of loss of data in the case of pages being mixed up or destroyed.</ref> Why they were not published within Leonardo's lifetime is unknown.<ref name=DA/>

===Scientific studies===
[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|upright|[[Rhombicuboctahedron]] as published in [[Luca Pacioli|Pacioli's]] ''[[De divina proportione|De Divina Proportione]]'']]
Leonardo's approach to science was an observational one: he tried to understand a phenomenon by describing and depicting it in utmost detail and did not emphasize experiments or [[Theory|theoretical]] explanation. Since he lacked formal education in [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[mathematics]], contemporary scholars mostly ignored Leonardo the scientist, although he did teach himself Latin. In the 1490s he studied mathematics under [[Luca Pacioli]] and prepared a series of drawings of regular solids in a skeletal form to be engraved as plates for Pacioli's book ''[[De divina proportione|De Divina Proportione]]'', published in 1509.<ref name=DA/>

It appears that from the content of his journals he was planning a series of treatises to be published on a variety of subjects. A coherent treatise on [[anatomy]] was said to have been observed during a visit by Cardinal Louis 'D' Aragon's secretary in 1517.<ref>
{{Cite book

}}</ref> Aspects of his work on the studies of anatomy, light and the landscape were assembled for publication by his pupil Francesco Melzi and eventually published as ''[[A Treatise on Painting|Treatise on Painting by Leonardo da Vinci]]'' in France and Italy in 1651 and Germany in 1724,<ref>della Chiesa, p.117</ref> with engravings based upon drawings by the Classical painter [[Nicholas Poussin]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} According to Arasse, the treatise, which in France went into sixty two editions in fifty years, caused Leonardo to be seen as "the precursor of French academic thought on art".<ref name=DA/>

While Leonardo's experimentation followed clear scientific methods, a recent and exhaustive analysis of Leonardo as scientist by Frtijof Capra argues that Leonardo was a fundamentally different kind of scientist from [[Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and other scientists who followed him in that, as a Renaissance Man, his theorising and hypothesising integrated the arts and particularly painting.<ref>Capra, Fritjof. The Science of Leonardo; Inside the Mind of the Genius of the Renaissance. (New York, Doubleday, 2007)</ref>

[[File:Studies of the Arm showing the Movements made by the Biceps.jpg|left|thumb|Anatomical study of the arm, (c.&nbsp;1510)]]

===Anatomy===
Leonardo's formal training in the [[anatomy]] of the [[human body]] began with his apprenticeship to [[Andrea del Verrocchio]], who insisted that all his pupils learn anatomy. As an artist, he quickly became master of ''topographic anatomy'', drawing many studies of [[muscle]]s, [[tendon]]s and other visible anatomical features.

As a successful artist, he was given permission to [[Dissection|dissect]] human corpses at the [[Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova]] in Florence and later at hospitals in Milan and Rome. From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies with the doctor [[Marcantonio della Torre]]. Leonardo made over 200 pages of drawings and many pages of notes towards a treatise on anatomy. These papers were left to his heir, Francesco Melzi, for publication, a task of overwhelming difficulty because of its scope and Leonardo's idiosyncratic writing.<ref name=KDK/> It was left incomplete at the time of Melzi's death more than fifty years later, with only a small amount of the material on anatomy included in Leonardo's ''Treatise on painting'', published in France in 1632.<ref name=DA/><ref name=KDK>Kenneth D. Keele, ''Leonardo da Vinci's Influence on Renaissance Anatomy'', (1964)[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1033412/pdf/medhist00157-0072.pdf]</ref> During the time that Melzi was ordering the material into chapters for publication, they were examined by a number of anatomists and artists, including Vasari, [[Benvenuto Cellini|Cellini]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]] who made a number of drawings from them.<ref name=KDK/>

Leonardo drew many studies of the [[human skeleton]] and its parts, as well as muscles and sinews. He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied to it in a manner that prefigured the modern science of [[biomechanics]].<ref name=Mason>

He drew the heart and [[Circulatory system|vascular system]], the [[sex organs]] and other internal organs, making one of the first scientific drawings of a [[fetus]] ''in utero''.<ref name=Popham/> As an artist, Leonardo closely observed and recorded the effects of age and of human emotion on the physiology, studying in particular the effects of rage. He also drew many figures who had significant facial deformities or signs of illness.<ref name=DA/><ref name=Popham/> 

Leonardo also studied and drew the anatomy of many animals, dissecting cows, birds, monkeys, bears, and frogs, and comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. He also made a number of studies of horses.

===Engineering and inventions===
[[File:Design for a Flying Machine.jpg|thumb|A design for a flying machine, (c.&nbsp;1488) Institut de France, Paris]]
During his lifetime Leonardo was valued as an engineer. In a letter to [[Ludovico il Moro]] he claimed to be able to create all sorts of machines both for the protection of a city and for siege. When he fled to Venice in 1499 he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack. He also had a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno River, a project on which [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] also worked.<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Roger Masters]] | title = Machiavelli, Leonardo and the Science of Power | year = 1996 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = [[Roger Masters]] | title = Fortune is a River: Leonardo Da Vinci and Niccolò Machiavelli's Magnificent Dream to Change the Course of Florentine History | year = 1998 }}</ref> Leonardo's journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical. They include [[Viola organista|musical instruments]], hydraulic pumps, reversible crank mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a [[steam cannon]].<ref name=LB/><ref name=DA/>

In 1502, Leonardo produced a drawing of a single span {{convert|720|ft|m|adj=on}} bridge as part of a [[civil engineering]] project for Ottoman [[Sultan]] [[Beyazid II]] of [[Constantinople]]. The bridge was intended to span an inlet at the mouth of the [[Bosporus]] known as the [[Golden Horn]]. Beyazid did not pursue the project because he believed that such a construction was impossible. Leonardo's vision was resurrected in 2001 when a [[Vebjørn Sand Da Vinci Project|smaller bridge]] based on his design was constructed in Norway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vebjorn-sand.com/ |title=The Leonardo Bridge Project |publisher=Vebjorn-sand.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last =Levy | first =Daniel S. | title =Dream of the Master | publisher =''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine | date = October 4, 1999 | url =http://www.vebjorn-sand.com/dreamsofthemaster.html | accessdate =2007-09-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070912033510/http://www.vebjorn-sand.com/dreamsofthemaster.html|archivedate = 2007-09-12}}</ref>

For much of his life, Leonardo was fascinated by the phenomenon of [[flight]], producing many studies of the flight of birds, including his c.&nbsp;1505 [[Codex on the Flight of Birds]], as well as plans for several flying machines, including a light [[hang glider]] and a machine resembling a [[helicopter]].<ref name=DA/> The British television station [[Channel Four]] commissioned a documentary ''Leonardo's Dream Machines'', for broadcast in 2003. Leonardo's machines were built and tested according to his original designs.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365434/ Leonardo's Dream Machines]</ref> Some of those designs proved a success, whilst others fared less well when practically tested.

==Fame and reputation==
{{Main|Cultural references to Leonardo da Vinci}}
[[File:Francois I recoit les derniers soupirs de Leonard de Vinci by Ingres.jpg||left|thumb|''Francis I of France receiving the last breath of Leonardo da Vinci'', by [[Ingres]], 1818]]
Within Leonardo's own lifetime his fame was such that the King of France carried him away like a trophy and was claimed to have supported him in his old age and held him in his arms as he died. Interest in Leonardo has never diminished. The crowds still queue to see his most famous artworks, [[T-shirt]]s bear his most famous drawing, and writers continue to marvel at his genius and speculate about his private life and, particularly, about what one so intelligent actually believed in.<ref name=DA/>

[[Giorgio Vasari]], in the enlarged edition of ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'', 1568,<ref>Vasari, p.255</ref> introduced his chapter on Leonardo da Vinci with the following words:{{quote|In the normal course of events many men and women are born with remarkable talents; but occasionally, in a way that transcends nature, a single person is marvellously endowed by Heaven with beauty, grace and talent in such abundance that he leaves other men far behind, all his actions seem inspired and indeed everything he does clearly comes from God rather than from human skill. Everyone acknowledged that this was true of Leonardo da Vinci, an artist of outstanding physical beauty, who displayed infinite grace in everything that he did and who cultivated his genius so brilliantly that all problems he studied he solved with ease.|[[Giorgio Vasari]]}}
The continued admiration that Leonardo commanded from painters, critics and historians is reflected in many other written tributes. [[Baldassare Castiglione]], author of ''Il Cortegiano'' ("The Courtier"), wrote in 1528: "...&nbsp;Another of the greatest painters in this world looks down on this art in which he is unequalled&nbsp;..."<ref>
{{Cite journal
 | author-link = Baldassare Castiglione
 | first = Baldassare
 | last = Castiglione
 | title = Il Cortegiano

}}</ref> while the biographer known as "Anonimo Gaddiano" wrote, c.&nbsp;1540: "His genius was so rare and universal that it can be said that nature worked a miracle on his behalf&nbsp;...".<ref>"Anonimo Gaddiani", elaborating on ''Libro di Antonio Billi'', 1537–1542</ref>

[[File:Leonardo IMG 1759.JPG|thumb|Statue of Leonardo in [[Amboise]]]]
The 19th century brought a particular admiration for Leonardo's genius, causing [[Henry Fuseli]] to write in 1801: "Such was the dawn of modern art, when Leonardo da Vinci broke forth with a splendour that distanced former excellence: made up of all the elements that constitute the essence of genius&nbsp;..."<ref>
{{Cite journal
 | first = Henry
 | last = Fuseli

{{Cite journal

By the 19th century, the scope of Leonardo's notebooks was known, as well as his paintings. [[Hippolyte Taine]] wrote in 1866: "There may not be in the world an example of another genius so universal, so incapable of fulfilment, so full of yearning for the infinite, so naturally refined, so far ahead of his own century and the following centuries."<ref>
{{Cite journal

Art historian [[Bernard Berenson]] wrote in 1896: "Leonardo is the one artist of whom it may be said with perfect literalness: Nothing that he touched but turned into a thing of eternal beauty. Whether it be the cross section of a skull, the structure of a weed, or a study of muscles, he, with his feeling for line and for light and shade, forever transmuted it into life-communicating values."<ref>

The interest in Leonardo's genius has continued unabated; experts study and translate his writings, analyse his paintings using scientific techniques, argue over attributions and search for works which have been recorded but never found.<ref>

Leonardo can be considered, quite rightly, to have been the universal genius par excellence, and with all the disquieting overtones inherent in that term. Man is as uncomfortable today, faced with a genius, as he was in the 16th century. Five centuries have passed, yet we still view Leonardo with awe."<ref name= LB/>
