The '''Epilepsy Foundation''', also '''Epilepsy Foundation of America''' (EFA), is a non-profit national foundation, headquartered in [[Landover, Maryland]], dedicated to the welfare of people with [[epilepsy]] and seizure disorders. The foundation was established in 1968 and now has a network of 59 affiliates.  The foundation's programs aim to "ensure that people with seizures are able to participate in all life experiences; and to prevent, control and cure epilepsy through research, education, advocacy and services."

The Epilepsy Foundation came into existence as the result of a merger of the Epilepsy Association of America and the Epilepsy Foundation in 1967. It has since been joined by the National Epilepsy League. In December 2012, it merged with The Epilepsy Therapy Project. The new mission of the Foundation is to "stop seizures and SUDEP, find a cure and overcome the challenges created by epilepsy through efforts including education, advocacy and research to accelerate ideas into therapies".<ref name="newmission">{{cite news |title=Epilepsy Foundation And Epilepsy Therapy Project Finalize Merger To Create Strong, Unified Organization To Support People With Epilepsy|url=http://www.epilepsyfoundation.org/resources/newsroom/pressreleases/Epilepsy-Foundation-And-Epilepsy-Therapy-Project-Finalize-Merger-To-Create-Strong-Unified-Organization-To-Support-People-With-Epilepsy.cfm |date=December 26, 2012 |accessdate=April 10, 2013}}</ref> Programs included educational, counseling, referral, and employment assistance. In addition the EFA has advisory and youth programs, training grants and programs.

==2008 forum invasion==
On March&nbsp;28, 2008, ''[[Wired News]]'' reported that "Internet [[griefer]]s"—a slang term for people whose only interests are in harassing others<ref name="ramadgeepilepsy"/>—assaulted an [[epilepsy]] support forum run by the [[Epilepsy Foundation of America]].<ref name="wiredepilepsy">{{cite news |author=Kevin Poulsen |title=Hackers Assault Epilepsy Patients via Computer |url=http://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2008/03/epilepsy |work=[[Wired News]]  |date=March 28, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> [[JavaScript]] code and flashing computer animations were posted to trigger [[migraine]] headaches and [[seizure]]s in [[photosensitive epilepsy|photosensitive and pattern-sensitive epileptics]].<ref name="wiredepilepsy"/> According to ''Wired News'', circumstantial evidence suggested that the attack was perpetrated by Anonymous users, with the initial attack posts on the epilepsy forum blaming [[eBaum's World]]. Members of the epilepsy forum claimed they had found a thread in which the attack was being planned at 7chan.org, an [[imageboard]] that has been described as a stronghold for Anonymous. The thread, like all old threads eventually do on these types of imageboards, has since cycled to deletion.<ref name="wiredepilepsy"/>

''[[RealTechNews]]''{{Verify credibility|date=September 2008}} reported that the forum at the United Kingdom-based [[National Society for Epilepsy]] was also subjected to an identical attack. It stated that "apparent members of Anonymous" had denied responsibility for both attacks and posted that it had been the Church of Scientology who carried them out.<ref name="realtechnewsepilepsy">{{cite news |author=Michael Santo |title=Hackers Attack Epilepsy Forum; Cause Headaches, Seizures |url=http://www.realtechnews.com/posts/5548 |work=[http://www.realtechnews.com/ RealTechNews] |publisher=Underground Networks |date= March 29, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> ''[[News.com.au]]'' reported that the administrators of 7chan.org had posted an open letter claiming that the attacks had been carried out by the Church of Scientology "to ruin the public opinion of Anonymous, to lessen the effect of the lawful protests against their virulent organization" under the Church's [[Fair Game (Scientology)|fair game]] policy.<ref name="ramadgeepilepsy">{{cite news |author=Andrew Ramadge |title=Anonymous attack targets epilepsy sufferers |url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0,25642,23460969-5014239,00.html |work=News.com.au  |date=April 1, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> The church has previously been involved in [[False Flag#Ideological|false flag]] operations to frame and discredit groups or peoples it disagrees with such as [[Operation Freakout#Harassment|Operation Freakout]] and [[Gabe Cazares#Endures harassment|Gabe Cazares]].{{Syn|date=March 2011}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikisource/en/wiki/United_States_of_America_v._Jane_Kember,_Morris_Budlong,_Sentencing_Memorandum |title=United States of America v.

''[[The Tech Herald]]''{{Verify credibility|date=September 2008}} reported that when the attack began, posts referenced multiple groups, including Anonymous. The report attributes the attack to a group named "The Internet Hate Machine" (a reference to the [[#KTTV Fox 11 news report|KTTV Fox 11 news report]]), who claim to be part of Anonymous, but are not the same faction that are involved in the campaign against Scientology.<ref name="TechEpilepsy">{{cite web |url=http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/200814/568/Targeted-physical-attack-takes-aim-at-Epilepsy |accessdate=April 2, 2008 |title=Targeted physical attack takes aim at Epilepsy |author=Steve Ragan |date=March 31, 2008 |publisher=The Tech Herald}}</ref> Some Anonymous participants of [[Project Chanology]] suggest that the perpetrators are Internet users who merely remained anonymous in the literal sense, and thus had no affiliation with the larger anti-Scientology efforts attributed to Anonymous.<ref name="TechEpilepsy"/> During an interview with CNN, Scientologist Tommy Davis accused Anonymous of hacking into the Epilepsy Foundation website to make it display imagery intended to cause epileptic seizures.

==Controversy==
According to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', the foundation, with its local affiliates, has been [[lobbying]] for state laws in 25 states that would prevent pharmacists from substituting generic epilepsy drugs for brand-name drugs unless the pharmacist had written consent of the physician or patient. The pharmaceutical industry has also been lobbying state legislatures for the change, and working with the foundation.

The pharmaceutical industry spent $8.8 million in state campaign contributions in 2006. In its annual report, the Epilepsy Foundation reported that it got $500,000 to $999,999 from [[GlaxoSmithKline]], and $100,000 to $499,999 from each of [[Abbott Laboratories]] and [[Johnson & Johnson]]. Representatives of four pharmaceutical companies sit on the Epilepsy Foundation's board, as does [[Billy Tauzin]], head of [[PhRMA]], which gave $25,000 to $49,999. The Foundation denied that pharmaceutical funding had anything to do with its support of the laws.

Generic drug substitution is significant, according to the Journal, because four major branded drugs, with $5 billion revenue last year, will be going off-patent by 2010. (The five best-selling drugs are [[Topamax]], [[Lamictal]], [[Lyrica]], [[Keppra]] and [[Depakote]].) Pharmacists can now substitute generics, because every generic drug, in order to be approved, has to demonstrate that it is equivalent to the branded drug.

The Epilepsy Foundation received anecdotal reports of patients experiencing seizures and side effects after switching drugs, and tried to convince the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1999 that there was a problem, but the FDA decided there was no evidence. In 2006, the Foundation convened a committee of medical experts, and its own experts also found no evidence. Nonetheless, the Foundation recommended that doctors be required to give permission to switch to generics.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article_print/SB118426152232264867.html Pill push: Industry fights switch to generics for epilepsy, big drug makers help patient groups lobby; more attention to states], Sarah Rubenstein, Wall Street Journal, July 13, 2007.
