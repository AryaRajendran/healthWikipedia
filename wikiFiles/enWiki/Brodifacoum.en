'''Brodifacoum''' is a highly lethal [[4-hydroxycoumarin]] [[vitamin K antagonist]] [[anticoagulant]] [[poison]]. In recent years, it has become one of the world's most widely used [[pesticides]]. It is typically used as a [[rodenticide]] but is also used to control larger mammalian pests such as [[possum]].<ref name="DoCManual">Eason, C.T. and Wickstrom, M. ''Vertebrate pesticide toxicology manual'', [[New Zealand Department of Conservation]]</ref> 

Brodifacoum has an especially long half-life in the body, which ranges to several months, requiring prolonged treatment with antidotal vitamin K for both human and pet poisonings.

== Toxicology ==
Brodifacoum is a [[4-hydroxycoumarin]] anticoagulant, with a similar mode of action to its historical predecessors [[dicoumarol]] and [[warfarin]]. However, due to very high potency and long duration of action (elimination [[half-life]] of 20 &ndash; 130 days), it is characterised as a "second generation" or "superwarfarin" anticoagulant.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.inchem.org/documents/hsg/hsg/hsg093.htm Brodifacoum (HSG 93, 1995)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Brodifacoum inhibits the [[enzyme]] ''[[vitamin K epoxide reductase]]''. This enzyme is needed for the reconstitution of the vitamin K in its cycle from vitamin K-epoxide, and so brodifacoum steadily decreases the level of active vitamin K in the blood. Vitamin K is required for the synthesis of important substances including [[prothrombin]], which is involved in [[blood clotting]]. This disruption becomes increasingly severe until the blood effectively loses any ability to clot.
 
In addition, brodifacoum (as with other anticoagulants in toxic doses) increases [[Vascular permeability|permeability]] of blood capillaries; the blood plasma and blood itself begins to leak from the smallest blood vessels. A poisoned animal will suffer progressively worsening internal bleeding, leading to [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], loss of consciousness, and eventually [[death]].

Brodifacoum is highly lethal to mammals and birds, and extremely lethal to fish. It is a highly [[bioaccumulation|cumulative]] poison, due to its high [[lipophilicity]] and extremely slow [[Clearance (medicine)|elimination]].

Following are acute {{LD50}} values for various animals (mammals):<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.inchem.org/documents/pds/pds/pest57_e.htm Brodifacoum (PDS)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

* guinea-pigs (oral) 0.28&nbsp;mg/kg b.w.

LD<sub>50</sub> values for various birds varies from about 1&nbsp;mg/kg b.w. — 20&nbsp;mg/kg b.w.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

LC<sub>50</sub> for fish:
* trout (96 hours exposure) 0.04 ppm<ref>http://www.wil-kil.com/public/2005-06_labels-msds/WeatherBlok%20XT%20M.pdf#search=%22LC50%2Bbrodifacoum%22</ref>

Given these extremely high toxicities in various mammals, brodifacoum is classified as "extremely toxic" (LD<sub>50</sub> < 1.0&nbsp;mg/kg b.w.) and "very toxic" (T+; LD<sub>50</sub> < 25&nbsp;mg/kg b.w.), respectively. Because of its persistency, cumulative potential and high toxicities for various wildlife species, it is also considered an environmental pollutant (N; noxious to the environment).
The readiness of brodifacoum to penetrate intact skin should be noted, and brodifacoum and commercial preparations containing it should be handled with respective care and precaution because of its skin resorptivity.

The estimated average fatal dose for an adult man (60&nbsp;kg b.w.) is about 15&nbsp;mg, without treatment.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> However, due to low bait concentrations (usually 10 – 50&nbsp;mg/kg bait, i.e. 0.001 — 0.005%) and slow onset of symptoms, and the existence of a highly effective antidote (appropriately dosed vitamin K<sub>1</sub>), brodifacoum is considered to be of relatively low hazard to humans. A caveat is that the poisoning must be identified specifically, so that vitamin K supplementation and monitoring may be maintained for periods that range up to months. The same is true for pets which ingest the substance.

== Brand names ==
[[File:Brodifacoum notice.jpg|thumb|DOC Notice to hikers of poison baits in New Zealand.]]
[[File:Ratpoison Bait Box.JPG|thumb|Baitbox from Finland containing brodifacoum]] 
Brodifacoum is marketed under a large variety of trade names, including ''Biosnap'', ''d-Con'', ''Finale'', ''Fologorat'', ''Havoc'', ''Jaguar'', ''Klerat'', ''Matikus'', ''Mouser'', ''Pestanal'' (Sigma-Aldrich BT), ''Pestoff'', ''Ratak+'', ''Rodend'', ''Rodenthor'', ''Ratsak'', ''Talon'', ''Volak'', Vertox and ''Volid'', "Rataquill Colombia".

== Treatment for humans==
The primary antidote to brodifacoum poisoning is immediate administration of [[vitamin K|vitamin K<sub>1</sub>]] (dosage for humans: initially slow intravenous injections of 10–25&nbsp;mg repeated all 3&ndash;6 hours until normalisation of the prothrombin time; then 10&nbsp;mg orally four times daily as a "maintenance dose"). It is an extremely effective antidote, provided the poisoning is caught before excessive bleeding ensues.  As high doses of brodifacoum can affect the body for many months, the antidote must be administered regularly for a long period (several months, in keeping with the substance's half-life) with frequent monitoring of the [[prothrombin time]].<ref>Clin Toxicol (Phila). 2007 Jun-Aug;45(5):487-9. Brodifacoum poisoning with toxicokinetic data. Olmos V, López CM. PMID 17503253 Brodifacoum half-life</ref>

If unabsorbed poison is still in the digestive system, [[gastric lavage]] followed by administration of [[activated charcoal]] may be required.

Further treatments to be considered include infusion of [[blood]] or [[Blood plasma|plasma]] to counteract [[Hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]]; and in severe cases, infusion of blood clotting factor concentrate.

Another potential treatment is [[phenobarbital]], which is believed to accelerate the metabolism of  some anticoagulants via [[Enzyme induction and inhibition|enzyme induction]].{{fact|date=August 2012}}

== Poisoning case reports ==
There have been at least ten case reports of brodifacoum intoxication in the medical literature.

In one report,<ref name="LiptonKlass">Lipton, R.A. & Klass, E.M. (1984) ''Human ingestion of a 'superwarfarin' rodenticide resulting in a prolonged anticoagulant effect.'' [[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] 252:3004-3005.</ref> a woman deliberately consumed over 1.5 kilograms of rat bait, constituting about 75&nbsp;mg brodifacoum, but made a full recovery after receiving conventional medical treatment.

In another report,<ref name="LaRosaEtAl">La Rosa, F, Clarke, S. & Lefkowitz, J. B. (1997) ''Brodifacoum intoxication with marijuana smoking.'' Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine 121:67-69.</ref> a 17-year-old boy presented to the hospital with a severe bleeding disorder. It was discovered that he habitually smoked a mixture of brodifacoum and [[marijuana]]. Despite treatment with vitamin K, the bleeding disorder persisted for several months. He eventually recovered.

==Environmental toxicology==
The [[American Bird Conservancy]] has advocated that brodifacoum not be used by the general public.  They cite several studies indicating that secondary poisonings of predatory birds and animals are common due to the extreme persistence of the pesticide within both target and non-target species.  It may also be dispersed by insects that feed on poisoned bait without harm and retain the pesticide within their bodies.
