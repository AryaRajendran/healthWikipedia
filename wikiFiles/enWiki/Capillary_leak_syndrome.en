'''Capillary leak syndrome''' (usually '''Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome''', '''SCLS''' or '''Clarkson’s Disease''') is a rare medical condition
characterized by self-reversing episodes during which the [[endothelial]] cells which line the capillaries are thought to separate for a few days, allowing for a leakage of fluid from the [[circulatory system]] to the [[interstitial space (biology)|interstitial space]], resulting in a dangerous [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure), [[hemoconcentration#Elevated|hemoconcentration]], and [[hypoalbuminemia]]. It is a life-threatening illness because each episode has the potential to cause damage to, or the failure of, vital organs due to limited [[perfusion]]. It is often misdiagnosed as [[polycythemia]], [[polycythemia vera]] or [[sepsis]].

==History==
The [[syndrome]] was first described by B. Clarkson in 1960,<ref name="clarkson">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(60)90018-8 |title=Cyclical edema and shock due to increased capillary permeability |year=1960 |last1=Clarkson |first1=Bayard |last2=Thompson |first2=David |last3=Horwith |first3=Melvin |last4=Luckey |first4=E.Hugh |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=29 |issue=2 |pmid=13693909 |pages=193–216}}</ref> after whom it was later informally named. Beyond numerous case reports published since then, two comprehensive reviews of clinical and research experience were published in 2010.<ref name="druey">{{cite journal |first1=Kirk M. |last1=Druey |first2=Philip R. |last2=Greipp |title=Narrative Review: Clarkson Disease-Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |pmid=20643990 |pages=90–8 |doi=10.1059/0003-4819-153-2-201007200-00005 |pmc=3017349 |year=2010 |volume=153 |issue=2}}</ref><ref name="kapoor">{{cite journal |pages=905–12 |doi=10.4065/mcp.2010.0159 |pmc=2947962 |title=Idiopathic Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome (Clarkson's Disease): The Mayo Clinic Experience |year=2010 |last1=Kapoor |first1=Prashant |last2=Greipp |first2=Patricia T. |last3=Schaefer |first3=Eric W. |last4=Mandrekar |first4=Sumithra J. |last5=Kamal |first5=Arif H. |last6=Gonzalez-Paz |first6=Natalia C. |last7=Kumar |first7=Shaji |last8=Greipp |first8=Philip R. |journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings |volume=85 |issue=10 |pmid=20634497}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
Most patients report having a runny nose and/or other flu-like symptoms, or else gastro-intestinal disorders (diarrhea or vomiting), or a general weakness or pain in their limbs, but others get no particular or consistent warning signs ahead of their episode. They subsequently develop thirst and lightheadedness and the following measurable conditions:<ref name="druey"/><ref name="kapoor"/>

* [[hemoconcentration]];
* low blood pressure ([[hypotension]]);
* [[hypoalbuminemia]]; and
* partial or generalized [[edema]].

==Treatment==
An episode of SCLS usually consists of two distinct phases:<ref name="druey"/><ref name="kapoor"/>

===The capillary leak phase===
The initial stage is the capillary leak phase, lasting from 1 to 3 days, during which up to 70% of total plasma volume may invade cavities in the trunk and extremities.<ref name="druey" /> The most common clinical features are fatigue; lightheadedness up to and including [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]] (fainting); limb, abdominal or generalized pain; facial or other [[edema]]; [[dyspnea]]; and [[hypotension]] that results in [[shock (circulatory)|circulatory shock]] and potentially in cardiopulmonary collapse and other organ distress or damage.<ref name="druey" /><ref name="kapoor" /> Acute renal failure is a risk due to acute tubular necrosis consequent to [[hypovolemia]] and  [[rhabdomyolysis]].<ref name="druey" /><ref name="kapoor" />

The loss of fluid out of the capillaries has similar effects on the circulation as dehydration, slowing both the flow of oxygen delivered to tissues and organs as well as the output of [[urine]]. Urgent medical attention in this phase consists of fluid resuscitation efforts, mainly the intravenous administration of [[saline (medicine)|saline solution]] plus hetastarch or [[albumin]] and [[colloids]] (to increase the remaining blood flow to vital organs like the kidneys), as well as [[glucocorticoids]] (steroids like methylprednisolone, to reduce or stop the capillary leak).<ref name="druey" /> However, it is important to avoid overly aggressive intravenous fluid administration during this leak phase, because it may cause massive swelling of the extremities and thus serious collateral damage because of induced [[compartment syndrome|compartment syndromes]].<ref name="kapoor" />

===The recruitment phase===
The second stage features the reabsorption of the initially extravasated fluid and it usually lasts just as long as the leak phase. Intravascular fluid overload leads to [[polyuria]] and can cause flash [[pulmonary edema]] with possibly fatal consequences.<ref name="druey" /><ref name="kapoor" /> The severity of the problem depends on to the quantity of fluid supplied in the initial phase, the damage that may have been sustained by the kidneys, and the promptness with which [[diuretics]] are administered to help the patient discharge the accumulated fluids quickly.<ref name="druey" />

The prevention of episodes of SCLS has involved two approaches. The first has long been identified with the Mayo Clinic and it recommends treatment with [[beta agonists]] such as [[theophylline]], [[terbutaline]] and [[montelukast sodium]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1580299 |year=1992 |last1=Droder |first1=RM |last2=Kyle |first2=RA |last3=Greipp |first3=PR |title=Control of systemic capillary leak syndrome with aminophylline and terbutaline |volume=92 |issue=5 |pages=523–6 |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(92)90749-2}}</ref> The second, more recent  approach pioneered in France involves monthly intravenous infusions of [[intravenous immunoglobulin]] (IVIG), and the growing case-report evidence is encouraging.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=2184–7 |doi=10.1097/CCM.0b013e31817d7c71 |title=High-dose intravenous immunoglobulins dramatically reverse systemic capillary leak syndrome |year=2008 |last1=Lambert |first1=Marc |last2=Launay |first2=David |last3=Hachulla |first3=Eric |last4=Morell-Dubois |first4=Sandrine |last5=Soland |first5=Vincent |last6=Queyrel |first6=Viviane |last7=Fourrier |first7=François |last8=Hatron |first8=Pierre-Yves |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=36 |issue=7 |pmid=18552679}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pages=e3–4 |doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2009.09.034 |title=Immunoglobulins for Treatment of Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome |year=2010 |last1=Abgueguen |first1=Pierre |last2=Chennebault |first2=Jean Marie |last3=Pichard |first3=Eric |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=123 |issue=6 |pmid=20569743}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zipponi|first1=Manuel|last2=Eugster|first2=Roland|last3=Birrenbach|first3=Tanja|year=2011|title =High-dose intravenous immunoglobulins: A promising therapeutic approach for idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome|journal=BMJ Case Reports|volume=2011|doi=10.1136/bcr.12.2010.3599|url=http://casereports.bmj.com/content/2011/bcr.12.2010.3599.abstract}}</ref><ref name="pecker">{{cite journal |first1=Mark |last1=Pecker |first2=Michael |last2=Adams |first3=Walter |last3=Graham |title=The Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome: Comment |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |pmid=21893630 |pages=335 |doi=10.1059/0003-4819-155-5-201109060-00017 |year=2011 |volume=155 |issue=5}}</ref>

A recent review of clinical experience with 28 European SCLS patients suggests that either prophylactic treatment may reduce the frequency and severity of attacks and may improve survival.<ref name="gousseff">{{cite journal |first1=Marie |last1=Gousseff |first2=Laurent |last2=Arnaud |first3=Marc |last3=Lambert |first4=Arnaud |last4=Hot |first5=Mohamed |last5=Hamidou |first6=Pierre |last6=Duhaut |first7=Thomas |last7=Papo |first8=Martin |last8=Soubrier |first9=Marc |last9=Ruivard |title=The Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome: A Case Series of 28 Patients From a European Registry |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |pmid=21464348 |pages=464–71 |doi=10.1059/0003-4819-154-7-201104050-00004 |year=2011 |volume=154 |issue=7}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
In the Mayo Clinic’s experience, the median survival of 25 patients that were followed over 30 years (counting only SCLS-related deaths) was approximately 15 years, and their 5-year survival rate was 76%.<ref name="druey"/><ref name="kapoor"/> In European experience, the 5-year post-diagnosis survival rate was 85% in 23 patients who had received prophylactic treatment and 20% in 5 patients who had not.<ref name="gousseff" /> However, better identification and management of this condition appears to be resulting in lower mortality and improving survival and quality-of-life results as of late.
