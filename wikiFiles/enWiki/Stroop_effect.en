The Stroop effect is the finding that naming the color of the first set of words is easier and quicker than the second.
</div>

In [[psychology]], the '''Stroop effect''' is a demonstration of interference in the [[reaction time]] of a task. When the name of a color (e.g., "blue," "green," or "red") is printed in a color not denoted by the name (e.g., the word "red" printed in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color. The effect is named after [[John Ridley Stroop]] who first published the effect in English in 1935.<ref name="stroop">{{cite journal|title=Studies of interference in serial verbal reactions|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1935|first=John Ridley|last=Stroop|volume=18|issue=6|pages=643–662|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Stroop/|accessdate=2008-10-08|doi=10.1037/h0054651}}</ref> The effect had previously been published in Germany in 1929.<ref name="Jaensch">{{cite book|last=Jaensch|first=E.R|title=Grundformen menschlichen Seins|publisher=Otto Elsner|year = 1929|location = Berlin}}</ref><ref name="pmid5328883">{{cite journal|author=Jensen AR, Rohwer WD|title=The Stroop color-word test: a review|journal=Acta psychologica|volume=25|issue=1|pages=36–93|year=1966|pmid=5328883|doi=10.1016/0001-6918(66)90004-7}}</ref><ref name="pmid2034749">{{cite journal|author=MacLeod CM|title=Half a century of research on the Stroop effect: an integrative review|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=109|issue=2|pages=163–203|year=1991|month=March|pmid=2034749|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.109.2.163|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/bul/109/2/163}}{{registration required}}</ref> The original paper has been one of the most cited papers in the history of [[experimental psychology]], leading to more than 700 replications.<ref name="pmid2034749"/> The effect has been used to create a psychological test ('''Stroop Test''') that is widely used in clinical practice and investigation.

The effect is named after [[John Ridley Stroop]], who published the effect in English in 1935 in an article entitled ''Studies of interference in serial verbal reactions'' that includes three different experiments.<ref name="stroop"/> However, the effect was first published in 1929 in Germany, and its roots can be followed back to works of [[James McKeen Cattell]] and [[Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt]] in the nineteenth century.<ref name="Jaensch"/><ref name="pmid5328883"/><ref name="pmid2034749"/>

In his experiments, Stroop administered several variations of the same test for which three different kinds of stimuli were created. In the first one, names of colors appeared in black ink. In the second, names of colors appeared in a different ink than the color named. Finally in the third one, there were squares of a given color.<ref name="stroop"/>

In the first experiment, 1 and 2 were used (see first figure). The task required the participants to read the written color names of the words independently of the color of the ink (for example, they would have to read "purple" no matter what the color of its ink was). In the second experiment, stimulus 2 and 3 were used, and participants were required to say the color of the letters independently of the written word with the second kind of stimulus and also name the color of the dot squares. If the word "purple" was written in red, they would have to say "red", but not "purple"; when the squares were shown, the participant would have to say its color. Stroop, in the third experiment, tested his participants at different stages of practice at the tasks and stimulus used in the first and second experiments, to account for the effects of association.<ref name="stroop"/>

Stroop noted that participants took much longer to complete the color reading in the second task than they had taken to name the colors of the squares in Experiment 2. This delay had not appeared in the first experiment. Such interference was explained by the automation of reading, where the mind automatically determines the [[semantic]] meaning of the word (it reads the word "red" and thinks of the color "red"), and then must intentionally check itself and identify instead the color of the word (the ink is a color other than red), a process that is not automatized.<ref name="stroop"/>

Unlike researchers performing the Stroop test that is most commonly used in psychological evaluation,<ref name="Golden">{{cite book|last=Golden|first=CJ|title=Stroop Color and Word Test: A Manual for Clinical and Experimental Uses|publisher=Skoelting|year=1978|location=Chicago, Illinois|pages=1–32}}</ref> J.R Stroop never compares the time used for reading black words and the time needed for naming colors that conflicted with the written word.

== Experimental findings ==
Stimuli in Stroop paradigms can be divided into 3 groups: neutral, congruent and incongruent. Neutral stimuli are those stimuli in which only the text (similarly to stimuli 1 of Stroop's experiment), or color (similarly to stimuli 3 of Stroop's experiment) are displayed.<ref name="pmid19966248"/> Congruent stimuli are those in which the ink color and the word refer to the same color (for example the "pink" word written in pink). Incongruent stimuli are those in which ink color and word differ.<ref name="pmid19966248"/> Three experimental findings are recurrently found in Stroop experiments.<ref name="pmid19966248">{{cite journal |author=van Maanen L, van Rijn H, Borst JP |title=Stroop and picture-word interference are two sides of the same coin |journal=Psychon Bull Rev |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=987–99 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=19966248 |doi=10.3758/PBR.16.6.987 |url=}}</ref> A first finding is ''semantic interference'', which states that naming the ink color of neutral stimuli (e.g. when the ink color and word do not interfere with each other) is faster than in incongruent conditions. It is called semantic interference since it is usually accepted that the relationship in meaning between ink color and word is at the root of the interference.<ref name="pmid19966248"/> The second finding, ''semantic facilitation'', explains the finding that naming the ink of congruent stimuli is faster (e.g. when the ink color and the word match) than when neutral stimuli are present (e.g. when the ink is black, but the word describes a color). The third finding is that both semantic interference and facilitation disappear when the task consists of reading the word instead of naming the ink. It has been sometimes called ''Stroop asynchrony'', and has been explained by a reduced automatization when naming colors compared to reading words.<ref name="pmid19966248"/>

In the study of [[interference theory]], the most commonly used procedure has been similar to Stroop's second experiment in which subjects are tested on naming colors of incompatible words and of control patches; however the first experiment (reading words in black versus incongruent colors) has received less interest. In both cases, the interference score is expressed as the difference between the times needed to read each of the two types of cards.<ref name="pmid2034749"/> Usually lists of stimuli are used, but time measures for individual words permit more control on research variables.<ref name="pmid2034749"/> Rather than naming or reading stimuli aloud, subjects have also been asked to sort stimuli into categories.<ref name="pmid2034749"/> Different characteristics of the stimulus such as ink colors or direction of words have also been systematically varied.<ref name="pmid2034749"/> None of all these modifications eliminates the effect of interference.<ref name="pmid2034749"/>

The Stroop effect has been used to investigate a person's psychological capacities; since its discovery during the twentieth century, it has become a popular [[neuropsychological test]].<ref name="isbn0-19-511121-4">{{cite book |author=Howieson, Diane Black; Lezak, Muriel Deutsch; Loring, David W. |chapter=Orientation and attention|title=Neuropsychological assessment |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2004 |pages=3365–367 |isbn=0-19-511121-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2009-03-06|url=http://books.google.com/?id=FroDVkVKA2EC&pg=PA365}}</ref>

There are different test variants commonly used in [[Clinical neuropsychology|clinical settings]], with differences between them in the number of subtasks, type and number of stimulus, times for the task, or scoring procedures.<ref name="isbn0-19-511121-4"/><ref name="isbn0-19-515957-8">{{cite book|author=Spreen, Otfried; Strauss, Esther; Elisabeth M.

In the first trial, the written color name differs from the color ink it is printed in, and the participant must say the written word. In the second trial, the participant must name the ink color instead. However, there can be up to four different subtasks, adding in some cases stimuli consisting of groups of letters "X" or dots printed in a given color with the participant having to say the color of the ink; or names of colors printed in black ink that have to be read.<ref name="isbn0-19-511121-4"/> The number of stimuli varies between less than twenty items to more than 150, being closely related to the scoring system used. While in some test variants the score is the number of items from a subtask read in a given time, in others it is the time that it took to complete each of the trials.<ref name="isbn0-19-511121-4"/> The number of errors and different derived punctuations are also taken into account in some versions.<ref name="isbn0-19-511121-4"/>

In the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]], several variations of the Stroop task have been used to study the relations between [[speed of processing]] and [[executive functions]] with [[working memory]] and [[cognitive development]] in various domains. This research shows that reaction time to Stroop tasks decreases systematically from early childhood through early adulthood. These changes suggest that speed of processing increases with age and that cognitive control becomes increasingly efficient. Moreover, this research strongly suggests that changes in these processes with age are very closely associated with development in working memory and various aspects of thought.<ref>Demetriou, A., Christou, C., Spanoudis, G., & Platsidou, M. (2002). The development of mental processing: Efficiency, working memory, and thinking. ''Monographs of the Society of Research in Child Development, 67'', Serial Number 268.

A drawback to the original test was that it required verbal skills. This led researchers to look for alternative methods to implement the task in a way that gave the same interference but that didn't require reading abilities. One study found that two blocks of differing color, with the subject having to say the color of the block on the right produced a similar interference. Authors also found that the closer the blocks the longer the response time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Koch|first=Christopher|title=Time course of the color-color Stroop task|journal=Abstracts of the Psychonomic Society|year=2004|volume=9|page=59}}</ref>
