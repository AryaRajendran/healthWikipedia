The concept of Medix was developed by Professor [[Michael F Smith|M F Smith]] during 1999 and early 2000.<ref>Smith MF. Internet facilitates in situ survey research of practising clinicians. Pharmaceutical Visions 2001; (Summer):48-52. ISSN 0966-1719.</ref> Medix was incorporated and launched in early 2000 with Robin Guenier as Chairman (until 2006) and Dr Rino Coladangelo as [[CEO]]; Mike Smith was CTO until 2007. The basic idea of Medix was to recruit medical doctors on a country-by-country panel basis to respond to Internet based [[Statistical survey|survey]]s sponsored primarily by pharmaceutical companies. It was assumed that offering doctors email and equity in the venture would be sufficient to induce them to respond to surveys; this proved not to be the case, however, and direct [[remuneration]] per response was introduced early in the life of Medix. Medix independently developed the panel concept of respondents, which has become a common model for Internet surveying. The original Medix [[software]] has continued as the basis for the application and data service provider, fm2x limited [http://fm2x.com/fm2x/index.html].
