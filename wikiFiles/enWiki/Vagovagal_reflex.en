'''Vagus influence on gastric secretions.<ref>{{MeshName|Enterochromaffin-like+Cells}}</ref>

'''Vagovagal reflex''' refers to [[gastrointestinal tract]] reflex circuits where [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] and [[efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] fibers of the [[vagus nerve]]<ref name="pmid19008339">{{cite journal |author=Herman MA, Cruz MT, Sahibzada N, Verbalis J, Gillis RA |title=GABA signaling in the nucleus tractus solitarius sets the level of activity in dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus cholinergic neurons in the vagovagal circuit |journal=Am.

The vagovagal reflex controls contraction of the gastrointestinal muscle layers in response to distension of the tract by food.  This reflex also allows for the accommodation of large amounts of food in the gastrointestinal tracts. 

The parasympathetic vagus nerve composed of both afferents and efferents carries signals from stretch receptors, osmoreceptors, and chemoreceptors to dorsal vagal complex where the signal may be further transmitted to autonomic centers in the medulla. Efferent fibers of the vagus then carry signals to the gastrointestinal tract up to 2/3 of the Tranverse Colon (coinciding with the second GI Watershed Point).

==Function==
 
The vagovagal reflex is active during the receptive relaxation of the stomach in response to swallowing of food (prior to it reaching the stomach). When food enters the stomach a "vagovagal" reflex goes from the stomach to the brain, and then back again to the stomach causing active relaxation of the smooth muscle in the stomach wall. If vagal innervation is interrupted then intra-gastric pressure increases.

The vagal afferents are activated during the gastric phase of [[digestion]] when the corpus and fundus of the [[stomach]] are distended secondary to the entry of a food bolus. The stimulation of the mechanical receptors located in the gastric mucosa stimulates the vagus afferents. The completion of the reflex circuit by vagus efferents leads to the stimulation of postganglionic muscarinic nerves. These nerves release [[acetylcholine]] to stimulate two end effects. One, the parietal cells in the body of the stomach are stimulated to release H<sup>+</sup>. Two, the ECL cells of the [[lamina propria]] of the body of the stomach are stimulated to release [[histamine]]. Vagal stimulation of the peptidergic neurons, occurring simultaneously, leads to the release of gastrin-releasing-peptide. Finally, the [[Delta cells]] are inhibited to reduce the inhibition of [[gastrin]] release.
