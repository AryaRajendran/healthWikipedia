'''Penile plethysmography''' ('''PPG'''), or "phallometry", refers to measurement of [[blood]]flow to the [[human penis|penis]]. The most commonly reported methods of conducting penile plethysmography involve the measurement of the circumference of the penis with a mercury-in-rubber or electromechanical [[strain gauge]], or the volume of the penis with an airtight cylinder and inflatable cuff at the base of the penis. Corpus cavernosa nerve penile plethysmographs measure changes in response to inter-operative electric stimulation during surgery. The volumetric procedure was invented by [[Kurt Freund]] and is considered to be particularly sensitive at low arousal levels. The easier to use circumferential measures are more widely used, however, and more common in studies using erotic film stimuli.

For sexual offenders it is typically used to determine the level of [[sexual arousal]] as the subject is exposed to sexually suggestive content, such as pictures, movies or audio. Although there are individuals who have claimed that phallometry is not always appropriate for the evaluation of sexual preferences or treatment effects,<ref name="simon">Simon, W. T., & Schouten, P.

For [[prostatectomy]] [[nerve-sparing surgery]], the surgeon applies a mild electrical stimulation near the [[cavernous nerves of penis]] to verify their locations and avoid operative trauma. Damage to these difficult to see nerves can cause [[erectile dysfunction]] outcomes. At the surgery's conclusion, the electrical stimulation penile plethysmograph result is a [[prognostic]] which helps to manage the erectile function outcomes earlier than the many months required for recovery.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Klotz L, Heaton J, Jewett M, ''et al'' |title=A randomized phase 3 study of intraoperative cavernosa nerve stimulation with penile tumescence monitoring to improve nerve sparing during radical prostatectomy |journal=J.

==Types==
There are two types of penile plethysmograph:

*Volumetric air chamber
:When this is placed over the subject's penis, as [[tumescence]] increases, the air displaced is measured.
*Circumferential transducer
:This uses a mercury-in-rubber or indium/gallium-in-rubber ring or electromechanical [[strain gauge]] and is placed around the shaft of the subject's penis to measure changes in circumference.

The circumferential type is more common,<ref>Howes, R. J. (1995). A survey of plethysmographic assessment in North America. ''Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, 7,'' 9-24.</ref> but the volumetric method is believed to be more accurate at low arousal levels.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kuban M, Barbaree HE, Blanchard R |title=A comparison of volume and circumference phallometry: response magnitude and method agreement |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=345–59 |year=1999 |month=August |pmid=10553495 |doi= 10.1023/A:1018700813140|url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0004-0002&volume=28&page=345}}</ref>

Significant suppliers of PPG machines include Behavioral Technology Inc. and Medical Monitoring Systems. The device is known to be used in [[Brazil]], [[UK|Britain]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Hong Kong]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Slovak Republic]], [[Spain]], and the [[United States]].

The surgical machine is supplied as CaverMap by Blue Torch Medical Technology, Inc.

A roughly equivalent procedure for women, [[vaginal photoplethysmograph]]y, measures blood through the walls of the [[vagina]], which researchers claim increases during sexual arousal.

==History==
The original volumetric was developed during the 1950s by [[Kurt Freund]] in then-[[Czechoslovakia]]. Freund later wrote, "In the early fifties homosexual interaction was still an indictable offense in Czechoslovakia. I was of course opposed to this measure, but I still thought, as did my colleagues at the psychiatric university hospital in Prague where I was working, that homosexuality was an experientially acquired neurosis" (p.&nbsp;223)<ref>Freund, K. (1991). Reflections on the development of the phallometric method of assessing sexual preference. ''Annals of Sex Research, 4,'' 221–228. {{doi|10.1007/BF00850054}}</ref> He then developed phallometry to replace [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] methods of assessment because "[P]sychoanalysis had turned out to be a failure, virtually unusable as an instrument for individual diagnosis or research....When phallometry began to look promising as a test of erotic sex and age preferences, we started using it mainly as a test of pedophilia, that is determining who has an erotic preference for children over adults" (p.&nbsp;223-224).

In post-World-War-II Czechoslovakia, Freund was assigned by the communist government the task of identifying among military conscripts men who were falsely declaring themselves to be gay.<ref name = wilson2006>Wilson, R.

==Reliability and validity==
In 1994, the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (Fourth Edition) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] stated that penile plethysmography has been used in research settings to assess various paraphilias by measuring an individual's sexual arousal in response to visual and auditory stimuli. The reliability and validity of this procedure in clinical assessment have not been well established, and clinical experience suggests that subjects can simulate response by manipulating mental images."<ref name="dsmiv">DSM-IV, p. 524.</ref>

In 1998, Hanson and Bussière published a comprehensive meta-analysis of 61 scientific reports on the prediction of sexual offenses spanning more than 40,000 individual cases. They ascertained that of all the methods attempted and reported, penile phethysmographic responses to imagery depicting children was the single most accurate predictor of future offenses.<ref name = Hanson1998/> Another meta-analysis in 2005 of 73 studies repeated the finding that phallometric responses to children was a highly effective technique.<ref>Hanson, R. K., & Morton-Bourgon, K. E. (2005). The characteristics of persistent sexual offenders: A meta-analysis of recidivism studies. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 73,'' 1154-1163.</ref>

==Utility==

=== Erectile dysfunction ===
The penile plethysmograph has value in screening organic versus psychogenic [[erectile dysfunction]] in [[urological]] [[polysomnography]] centres.<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5377691.html Patent]</ref> Lack of sexual response during [[REM sleep]] may indicate that further evaluation by a [[urologist]] is required.<ref name="marshall">{{cite journal |author=Marshall P, Surridge D, Delva N |title=The role of nocturnal penile tumescence in differentiating between organic and psychogenic impotence: the first stage of validation |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |year=1981 |month=February |pmid=7212992 |doi= 10.1007/BF01542669|url=}}</ref>

When applied during nerve-sparing surgery, electrical stimulation penile plethysmograph is an erectile dysfunction prognostic.

A phallometric study indicated that men who are more homophobic show greater penile arousal to stimuli depicting gay sex than do less homophobic men.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Adams HE, Wright LW, Lohr BA |title=Is homophobia associated with homosexual arousal? |journal=J Abnorm Psychol |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=440–5 |year=1996 |month=August |pmid=8772014 |doi= 10.1037/0021-843X.105.3.440|url=http://blogs.psychologytoday.com/files/u47/Henry_et_al.pdf}}.[http://www.oogachaga.com/downloads/homophobia_and_homosexual_arousal.pdf]</ref>

===Pedophilia and hebephilia===
Studies examining the efficiency of using penile plethysmograph to distinguish between pedophilic men from non-pedophilic men show that a majority can be correctly assigned to the proper category.<ref name="13-1-118">{{cite journal |author=Blanchard R, Klassen P, Dickey R, Kuban ME, Blak T |title=Sensitivity and specificity of the phallometric test for pedophilia in nonadmitting sex offenders |journal=Psychol Assess |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=118–26 |year=2001 |month=March |pmid=11281033 |doi= 10.1037/1040-3590.13.1.118|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/pas/13/1/118}}</ref><ref name="57-1-100">{{cite journal |author=Freund K, Blanchard R |title=Phallometric diagnosis of pedophilia |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=100–5 |year=1989 |month=February |pmid=2925958 |doi= 10.1037/0022-006X.57.1.100|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/ccp/57/1/100}}</ref><ref>Murphy, W. & Barbaree, H.

===Cross-dressing===
Phallometry might distinguish men with erotic interests in [[cross-dressing]] from non-cross-dressers.<ref>Buhrich, N., & McConaghy, N. (1977). The discrete syndromes of transvestism and transsexualism. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 6, 483–495.</ref><ref>Freund, K., Seto, M. C., & Kuban, M. (1996). Two types of fetishism. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 34, 687–694.</ref>

===Biastophilia===
There is some evidence that phallometry can distinguish groups of men with [[biastophilia]] (a [[paraphilia]] involving [[rape]]) from groups of men without it.<ref>Seto, M. C., & Kuban, M. (1996). Criterion-related validity of a phallometric test for paraphilic rape and sadism. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 34, 175–183.</ref>

==Legal admissibility==
In general, phallometric test results are employed as part of the sentencing and rehabilitation phase of forensic systems, but ''not'' for determining whether a specific defendant is guilty of any specific offense against any specific person.

=== United States ===

====Use as trial evidence====
In the [[United States]], a scientific technique could not be used as evidence in court unless the technique was "generally accepted" as reliable in the relevant scientific community. This was known as the [[Frye standard]], adopted in 1923. In 1993, the doctrine was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in favor of a more comprehensive "reliable foundation" test in ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals]]''. In the [[Daubert standard]], the "generally accepted" test was no longer determinative. Several other factors could now be considered, including whether the technique had been published and peer reviewed. Myers notes, "Courts that have considered penile plethysmography generally rule that the technique is not sufficiently reliable for use in court." <ref name="myers">Myers JEB (2005). ''Myers on Evidence in Child, Domestic, and Elder Abuse Cases.'' Aspen Publishers Online ISBN 0-7355-5668-7</ref>

In ''United States v. Powers'' the court excluded the penile plethysmograph test because it failed to qualify under Daubert's scientific validity prong for two reasons: the scientific literature does not regard the test as a valid diagnostic tool, and "a vast majority of incest offenders who do not admit their guilt, such as Powers, show a normal reaction to the test. The Government argues that such [[false negative]]s render the test unreliable." <ref name="powers">''United States v. Powers'', 59 F.3d 1460 (4th Cir. 1995)</ref>

According to Barker and Howell, penile plethysmography (PPG) does not meet the legal threshold for the guilt phase for the following reasons:<ref name="barker">Barker and Howell, The Plethysmograph: A Review of Recent Literature, 20 ''Bull. Am. Acad. of Psychiatry and Law'' 13 (1992)</ref>

*No standardization
*Test results are not sufficiently accurate
*Results are subject to faking and voluntary control by test subjects
*High incidence of false negatives and false positives
*Results are open to interpretation

They concluded, "Until a way can be devised to detect and/or control false negatives and false positives, the validity of the test data will be questionable."<ref name="barker"/> Responding to Barker and Howell, Simon and Schouten noted, "Our own analysis suggests that the standardization and faking issues, as well as other problems not addressed in the Barker and Howell paper, warrant much more guarded conclusions about the use of the plethysmograph in legal and clinical settings." <ref name="simon"/> Prentky noted "the increased likelihood in forensic settings that dissimulation may compromise the validity of the assessment." <ref name="prentky">Prentky RA, Knight RA, Lee AFS (1997) Risk factors associated with recidivism among extrafamilial child molesters. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology.''</ref> Hall and Crowther noted penile plethysmography "may be even more problematic than other [methods] in assessing susceptibility of the test to faking." <ref name="hall">Hall GCN, Crowther JH (1991). Psychologists' involvement in cases of child maltreatment: additional limits of assessment methods. ''[[American Psychologist]]'' Jan Vol 46(1) 79-80</ref>

In ''State of North Carolina v. Spencer'',<ref name="spencer">North Carolina v. Spencer, 459 S.E.2d 812, 815 (N.C. Ct. App. 1995),</ref> the court reviewed the literature and case law and concluded that penile plethysmography was scientifically unreliable: "Despite the sophistication of the current equipment technology, a question remains whether the information emitted is a valid and reliable means of assessing sexual preference." 

More recently, a substantial amount of research data has been gathered and reviewed, and significant steps have been taken toward standardization.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} According to Launay (1999), "[T]he validity of the technique for research and clinical assessment is now established;"<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/cbm.317 | last1 = Launay | first1 = G. | year = 1999 | title = The phallometric assessment of sex offenders: an update | url = | journal = Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 254–274 }}</ref> it is only the use in guilt-determination proceedings that is inappropriate.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Fedoroff and Moran called it an "experimental procedure" and noted, "Virtually every expert who has written about phallometry has cautioned that it is insufficiently sensitive or specific to be used to determine the guilt or innocence of a person accused of a sex crime."<ref name="fedoroff">{{Cite journal | last1 = Fedoroff | first1 = JP | last2 = Moran | first2 = B | year = 1997 | title = Myths and Misconceptions about Sex Offenders | url = | journal = The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 1997 }}</ref>

====Post-conviction use====
Phallometry is widely considered appropriate for treatment and supervision of convicted [[Sex and the law|sex offenders]]: "Courts have permitted plethysmographic testing for monitoring compliance by convicted sex offenders with the conditions of their community placement as part of crime-related treatment for sexual deviancy."<ref>Sachsenmaier, S.

During the [[Catholic sex abuse cases]], the reliability of the test was questioned by some officials in the [[Sexual abuse scandal in Philadelphia archdiocese|Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia]].

=== Canada ===

Courts in [[Canada]] came to a similar conclusion as those in the United States. The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] adopted the [[Daubert standard|Daubert doctrine]] in ''R. v . J.-L.J.'' [2000] 2 S.C.R. 600, which upheld a lower court's decision to exclude testimony by a psychiatrist who had administered several tests on the accused, including a penile plethysmograph:

{{quote|A level of reliability that is quite useful in therapy because it yields some information about a course of treatment is not necessarily sufficiently reliable to be used in a court of law to identify or exclude the accused as a potential perpetrator of an offence. In fact, penile plethysmography has received a mixed reception in Quebec courts: ''Protection de la jeunesse'' – 539, [1992] R.J.Q. 1144; ''R. c. Blondin'', [1996] Q.J. No. 3605 (QL) (S.C.); L.

As of 2010, all youth in sex offender treatment programs administered by the Youth Forensic Psychiatric Service of [[British Columbia]] were offered a voluntary penile plethysmograph test to predict whether they can properly control their deviant arousal, or whether they will require medication or other forms of treatment. According to sceptics, however, the test does not reliably predict recurrent violations.<ref>[http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/07/29/adrian-macnair-b-c-government-rethinks-penis-arousal-tests/ Adrian MacNair: B.C. government rethinks penis-arousal tests (National Post, July 29, 2010)]</ref>

The EU's leading human rights agency, the Fundamental Rights Agency, has criticised the use of phallometric tests by the Czech Republic to determine whether asylum seekers presenting themselves as homosexual were in fact gay. According to the Agency, the Czech Republic was in 2010 the only EU country to employ a sexual arousal test, which the Agency said could violate the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11954499 Czech gay asylum 'phallometric test' criticised by EU (BBC, December 8, 2010)]</ref> In 2011 the [[EU commission]] issued a statement calling the Czech practice illegal, saying "The practice of phallometric tests constitutes a strong interference with the person's private life and human dignity. This kind of degrading treatment should not be accepted in the European Union, nor elsewhere." <ref>[http://euobserver.com/22/32349 Czech sexuality tests not legal, EU commission says (EUobserver, 17.05.2011)]</ref>
