The '''history of [[chronic fatigue syndrome]]''' ('''CFS''', also known by [[Alternative names for chronic fatigue syndrome|many other names]]) is thought to date back to the 19th century and before.

==Timeline==
Several descriptions of illness resembling those of chronic fatigue syndrome have been reported for at least two hundred years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lorusso L, Mikhaylova SV, Capelli E, Ferrari D, Ngonga GK, Ricevuti G |title=Immunological aspects of chronic fatigue syndrome |journal=Autoimmun Rev |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=287–91 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=18801465 |doi=10.1016/j.autrev.2008.08.003 |url=}}</ref> In the 19th century neurologist [[George Miller Beard]] popularised the concept of [[neurasthenia]] with symptoms including fatigue, anxiety, headache, impotence, neuralgia and depression.<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=George Miller Beard |last=Beard |first=G |year=1869 | title = Neurasthenia, or nervous exhaustion |journal=The [[Boston Medical and Surgical Journal]] |pages=217–221 }}</ref> This concept remained popular well into the 20th century, eventually coming to be seen as a behavioural rather than physical condition, with a diagnosis that excluded postviral syndromes.

In 1938, Alexander Gilliam described an illness that resembled [[poliomyelitis]], interviewing patients and reviewing records of one of several clusters which had occurred in Los Angeles, United States in 1934.<ref name="Gilliam38">{{cite journal |last=Gilliam |first=AG |year=1938| title= Epidemiological study on an epidemic, diagnosed as poliomyelitis, occurring among the personnel of Los Angeles County General Hospital during the summer of 1934, |journal=United States Treasury Department Public Health Service Public Health Bulletin |volume=240| pages=1–90 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]] }}</ref> The [[Los Angeles County Hospital]] outbreak included all or most of its nurses and doctors.<ref name="ISBN 078902196X"/> Gilliam called the outbreak "atypical [[poliomyelitis]]" and described the symptoms as: rapid muscle weakness, vasomotor instability, clonic twitches and cramps, ataxia, severe pain (usually aggravated by exercise), neck and back stiffness, menstrual disturbance and dominant sensory involvement.

Novices and convent candidates at a [[Wisconsin]] convent were diagnosed with "encephalitis" in 1936. Two towns in [[Switzerland]] had outbreaks of "abortive poliomyelitis" in 1937, and 73 Swiss soldiers were given the same diagnosis in 1939. Outbreaks in [[Iceland]] were called "Akureyri disease" or "simulating poliomyelitis" and were later called "Iceland disease." 800 people in [[Adelaide]], Australia became ill during 1949-1951 with a disease "resembling poliomyelitis." Two smaller clusters in the United States during 1950 were diagnosed as "Epidemic neuromyasthenia" and "resembling Iceland disease simulating acute anterior poliomyelitis." Additional outbreaks of poliomyelitis-like "mystery diseases" occurred from the 1950s through the 1980s in [[Denmark]], the United States, South Africa, and Australia, among others.<ref name="ISBN 078902196X">{{cite book |author=Roberto Patarca-Montero |title=Medical Etiology, Assessment, and Treatment of Chronic Fatigue and Malaise |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2004|pages=6–7 |isbn=0-7890-2196-X |oclc= }}</ref>

===ICD-8===
Since its introduction into the eighth edition of the WHO ICD-8 in 1969 (code 323), (Benign) myalgic encephalomyelitis has been classified as a disease of the central nervous system.<ref name="ICD_8_ME">{{Cite book | title = International Classification of Diseases | publisher=World Health Organization | year = 1969 | volume = I | edition = | pages = 158, (vol 2, pp. 173) | url = | id = | isbn = }}</ref>

===ICD-9===
The term "benign myalgic encephalomyelitis" appears in the 1975 [[List of ICD-9 codes|ICD-9]] alphabetic index, and references code 323.9, Encephalitis of unspecified cause.<ref name="ICD_9_ME">{{Cite book | title = International Classification of Diseases | publisher=World Health Organization | year = 1975 | volume = II | edition = | pages = 182 | url = http://www.icd9data.com/2008/Volume1/320-389/320-326/323/323.61.htm | id = | isbn = }}</ref> The code 323.9 did not include reference to postviral syndrome. The term “postviral syndrome” was classified to code 780.7, Malaise and fatigue, in Chapter 16, Symptoms, signs and ill-defined conditions.<ref name="CDC_Class"/>

<!--The name Chronic Fatigue Syndrome was apparently coined in 1959 by Italian researchers.<ref name="pmid14438664">{{cite journal |author=RONCHI W |title=[A new drug in the therapy of chronic fatigue syndrome] |language=Italian |journal=Minerva Med. |volume=50 |pages=3884–5 |year=1959 |pmid=14438664 }}</ref> -->The name Chronic Fatigue Syndrome has been attributed to the USA [[Centers for Disease Control]] 1988 research case definition for the illness, "Chronic fatigue syndrome: a working case definition".<ref name="isbn0-19-263049-0"/><ref name=Holmes1988/>
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) was added to ICD-9 after 1988 and listed under [[List of ICD-9 codes 780-799: Symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions|code 780.71]], Symptoms Signs and Ill-defined Conditions.

====ICD-9CM====
Since 1979 the U.S. has used a clinical modification of WHO's ICD 9th revision (ICD-9-CM),<ref name="CDC_Class"/> and ME is under index: "Encephalomyelitis (chronic) (granulomatous) (hemorrhagic necrotizing, acute) (myalgic, benign) (see also Encephalitis) 323.9."<ref name="ICD_9CM_ME">{{cite web | author=Centers for Disease Control | title = International Classification of Diseases 9th Revision Clinical Modification | publisher=National Center for Health Statistics | year = 2006 | edition = | pages = g 516 | url = ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Publications/ICD9-CM/2006/ | id = | isbn = | accessdate =April 29, 2008 }} Index to Diseases ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Publications/ICD9-CM/2006/Dindex07.zip</ref>

For CFS, a modification to the alphabetic index was made effective on October 1, 1991 to direct users to code 780.7, Malaise and fatigue, the same code used to identify cases of postviral syndrome. In 1998, a new five-digit code included 780.71, Chronic fatigue syndrome, consistent with the WHO version of ICD-9.<ref name="CDC_Class"/> Chronic fatigue syndrome is classified in tabular list: "Symptoms, Signs and Ill-Defined Conditions," under the sub-heading of "General Symptoms".<ref name="ICD_9CM_CFS">{{cite web | author=Centers for Disease Control | title = International Classification of Diseases 9th Revision Clinical Modification | publisher=National Center for Health Statistics | year = 2006 | edition = | pages = g 532 | url = ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Publications/ICD9-CM/2006/ | id = | isbn = | accessdate =April 29, 2008 }} Tabular List ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Publications/ICD9-CM/2006/Dtab07.zip</ref>

===ICD-10===
CFS is not included as a coded term in the 1992 [[ICD-10 Chapter VI: Diseases of the nervous system|ICD-10]], WHO created a new category G93, Other disorders of brain, in Chapter VI, Diseases of the Nervous System, and created a new code G93.3, [[post-viral fatigue syndrome]] (PVFS), a condition which was previously in the symptom chapter of ICD-9. WHO also moved benign myalgic encephalomyelitis to G93.3, subordinate to PVFS. The alphabetic index contains other terms, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, to which WHO assigned the same code.<ref name="CDC_Class"/><ref name="ICD_10_ME">{{Cite book | title = International Classification of Diseases | publisher=World Health Organization | year = 2007 | edition = Tabular List | url = http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gg90.htm+g93 | id = | isbn = }}</ref>

====ICD-10-CM====
The proposed U.S. classification [[ICD-10-CM]] (2010 Update replaces July 2009 version) separates CFS and Postviral fatigue syndrome into mutually exclusive categories. "Chronic fatigue, unspecified | Chronic fatigue syndrome not otherwise specified" appears in Chapter XVIII under R53.82. "Postviral fatigue syndrome | benign myalgic encephalomyelitis" appears in Chapter VI under G93.3.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10cm.htm International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), 2010 Update. Retrieved 2010-05-21.</ref> The [[Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Advisory Committee]] (CFSAC) had previously recommended CFS to be placed under the same neurological code as ME and PVFS, G93.3.<ref name="CFSAC_6">{{cite web | last = Jarman | first = John | title = Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Advisory Committee Sixth Meeting | publisher=U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | date = January 25, 2006 | url = http://www.hhs.gov/advcomcfs/cfsac050912_min.html | accessdate =April 30, 2008 }}</ref>
