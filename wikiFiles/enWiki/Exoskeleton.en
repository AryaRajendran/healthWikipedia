An '''exoskeleton''' (From Greek ἔξω, éxō = "outer" + σκελετός, skeletos = "skeleton") is the external [[skeleton]] that supports and protects an animal's body, in contrast to the internal skeleton ([[endoskeleton]]) of, for example, a [[Human skeleton|human]]. In popular usage, some of the larger kinds of exoskeletons are known as "'''shells'''". Examples of exoskeleton animals include [[insect]]s such as [[grasshopper]]s and [[cockroach]]es, and [[crustacean]]s such as [[crab]]s and [[lobster]]s. The [[Mollusc shell|shells]] of the various groups of shelled mollusks, including those of [[snail]]s, [[clam]]s, [[tusk shell]]s, [[chiton]]s and [[nautilus]], are also exoskeletons.

Mineralized exoskeletons first appeared in the [[fossil record]] about {{Ma|550}}, and their evolution is considered by some to have played a role in the subsequent [[Cambrian explosion]] of animals.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Some animals, such as the [[tortoise]], have both an endoskeleton and an exoskeleton.

==Role of the exoskeleton==
Exoskeletons contain rigid and resistant components that fulfil a set of functional roles including protection, excretion, sensing, support, feeding and acting as a barrier against desiccation in terrestrial organisms. Exoskeletons have a role in defense from pests and predators, support, and in providing an attachment framework for musculature.<ref name="Bengtson2004">{{Cite journal |contribution=Early skeletal fossils| author = S.

Exoskeletons contain [[chitin]]; the addition of [[calcium carbonate]] makes them harder and stronger.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Ingrowths of the arthropod exoskeleton known as '''apodemes''' serve as attachment sites for [[muscle]]s. These structures are composed of [[chitin]], and are approximately 6 times as strong and twice as stiff as vertebrate [[tendon]]s. Similar to tendons, apodemes can stretch to store elastic energy for jumping, notably in [[locust]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=H. C. Bennet-Clark |year=1975 |title=The energetics of the jump of the locust, ''Schistocerca gregaria'' |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Biology]] |volume=63 |pages=53–83 |pmid=1159370 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/63/1/53.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |issue=1}}</ref>

==Diversity==
Many produce exoskeletons, which are composed of a range of materials. Bone, cartilage, or dentine is used in the [[Ostracoderm]] fish and [[turtle]]s. [[Chitin]] forms the exoskeleton in [[arthropod]]s including [[insect]]s, [[arachnid]]s such as [[spider]]s, [[crustacean]]s such as [[crab]]s and [[lobster]]s (see [[arthropod exoskeleton]]), and in some [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[bacteria]]. Calcium carbonates constitute the shells of [[Mollusca|molluscs]] (see [[Mollusc shell]]), [[brachiopod]]s, and some tube-building [[polychaete]] worms. [[Silicon dioxide|Silica]] forms the exoskeleton in the microscopic [[diatom]]s and [[Radiolarian|radiolaria]].

Some organisms, such as some [[foraminifera]], agglutinate exoskeletons by sticking grains of sand and shell to their exterior. Contrary to a common misconception, [[echinoderm]]s do not possess an exoskeleton, as their [[Test (biology)|test]] is always contained within a layer of living tissue.

Exoskeletons have evolved independently many times; 18 lineages evolved [[Calcification|calcified]] exoskeletons alone.<ref name=Porter2007>{{cite journal | author = Susannah M. Porter | year = 2007 | title = Seawater chemistry and early carbonate biomineralization | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 316 | issue = 5829 | page = 1302 | doi = 10.1126/science.1137284 | pmid = 17540895 | bibcode=2007Sci...316.1302P}}</ref> Further, other lineages have produced tough outer coatings analogous to an exoskeleton, such as some mammals – (constructed from bone in the [[armadillo]], and hair in the [[pangolin]]) – and reptiles (turtle and [[Ankylosauria|Ankylosaur]] armor are constructed of bone; crocodiles have bony [[scute]]s and [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]y scales).

==Growth in an exoskeleton==
{{main|Ecdysis}}
Since exoskeletons are rigid, they present some limits to growth. Organisms with open shells can grow by adding new material to the aperture of their shell, as is the case in [[snail]]s, [[bivalve]]s and other [[mollusca]]ns. A true exoskeleton, like that found in [[arthropod]]s must be shed ([[Ecdysis|moulted]]) when it is outgrown.<ref name=Ewer>{{Cite journal |journal= PLoS Biology |volume=3 |issue=10 |pages=e349 |url=http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030349 |title=How the Ecdysozoan Changed Its Coat |date=2005-10-11 |author=John Ewer | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030349 |pmid= 16207077 |pmc= 1250302}}</ref> A new exoskeleton is produced beneath the old one. As the old one is shed, the new skeleton is soft and pliable. The animal will pump itself up to expand the new shell to maximal size, then let it harden. When the shell has set, the empty space inside the new skeleton can be filled up as the animal eats.<ref name=Ewer/> Failure to shed the exoskeleton once outgrown can result in the animal being suffocated within its own shell, and will stop subadults from reaching maturity, thus preventing them from reproducing. This is the mechanism behind some insect pesticides, like [[Azadirachtin]].<ref>{{cite journal | title = Synthesis of Azadirachtin: A Long but Successful Journey | author = Gemma E. Veitch, Edith Beckmann, Brenda J. Burke, Alistair Boyer, Sarah L. Maslen, Steven V.

==Paleontological significance==
[[File:BoredEncrustedShell.JPG|thumb|280px|Borings in exoskeletons can provide evidence of animal behavior. In this case, boring [[sponge]]s attacked this [[hard clam]] shell after the death of the clam, producing the trace fossil ''[[Entobia]]''.]]
Exoskeletons, as hard parts of organisms, are greatly useful in assisting preservation of organisms, whose soft parts usually rot before they can be fossilized. Mineralized exoskeletons can be preserved "as is", as shell fragments, for example. The possession of an exoskeleton also permits a couple of other routes to fossilization. For instance, the tough layer can resist compaction, allowing a mold of the organism to be formed underneath the skeleton, which may later decay.<ref name=Fedonkin2007>{{cite journal |author=M. A.

Butterfield | pmid=21680421}}</ref> or transformed to the resistant polymer [[keratin]], which can resist decay and be recovered.

However our dependence on fossilized skeletons also significantly limits our understanding of evolution. Only the parts of organisms that were already [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralized]] are usually preserved, such as the shells of mollusks. It helps that exoskeletons often contain "muscle scars", marks where muscles have been attached to the exoskeleton, which may allow the reconstruction of much of an organism's internal parts from its exoskeleton alone.<ref name=Fedonkin2007/> The most significant limitation is that, although there are 30-plus [[phylum|phyla]] of living animals, two-thirds of these phyla have never been found as fossils, because most animal species are soft-bodied and decay before they can become fossilized.<ref name="CowenHistLife">{{cite book | author=Richard Cowen |year=2004 |edition=4th | title=History of Life | publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |isbn=978-1-4051-1756-2}}</ref>

Mineralized skeletons first appear in the fossil record shortly before the base of the Cambrian period, {{Ma|550}}. The evolution of a mineralized exoskeleton is seen by some as a possible driving force of the Cambrian explosion of animal life, resulting in a diversification of predatory and defensive tactics. However, some Precambrian ([[Ediacaran]]) [[Ediacara biota|organisms]] produced tough outer shells,<ref name=Fedonkin2007/> while others, such as ''[[Cloudinid|Cloudina]]'', had a calcified exoskeleton.<ref name=Hua2003/>
Some ''Cloudina'' shells even show evidence of predation, in the form of borings.<ref name=Hua2003>{{Cite journal | author = Hong Hua, Brian R.

==Evolution==
{{further|Small shelly fauna}}
On the whole, the fossil record only contains mineralised exoskeletons, since these are by far the most durable. Since most lineages with exoskeletons are thought to have started out with a non-mineralised exoskeleton which they later mineralised, this makes it difficult to comment on the very early evolution of each lineage's exoskeleton.  We do know that in a very short course of time just before the [[Cambrian]] period exoskeletons made of various materials – silica, [[calcium phosphate]], [[calcite]], [[aragonite]], and even glued-together mineral flakes – sprang up in a range of different environments.<ref name=Dzik2007>{{cite journal |author=J.

Some Precambrian (Ediacaran) organisms produced tough but non-mineralized outer shells,<ref name=Fedonkin2007/> while others, such as ''Cloudina'', had a calcified exoskeleton,<ref name=Hua2003/> but mineralized skeletons did not become common until the beginning of the Cambrian period, with the rise of the "[[small shelly fauna]]". Just after the base of the Cambrian, these miniature fossils become diverse and abundant – this abruptness may be an illusion, since the chemical conditions which preserved the small shellies appeared at the same time.<ref name=Dzik1994>{{cite journal| author =J. Dzik| title = Evolution of 'small shelly fossils' assemblages of the early Paleozoic| year = 1994| journal = [[Acta Palaeontologica Polonica]]| volume = 39| issue = 3| pages = 27–313| url = http://www.paleo.pan.pl/people/Dzik/Dzik1994d.htm}}</ref> Most other shell forming organisms appear during the Cambrian period, with the [[Bryozoa]]ns being the only calcifying phylum to appear later, in the [[Ordovician]]. The sudden appearance of shells has been linked to a change in ocean chemistry which made the calcium compounds of which the shells are constructed stable enough to be precipitated into a shell. However this is unlikely to be a sufficient cause, as the main construction cost of shells is in creating the [[protein]]s and [[polysaccharide]]s required for the shell's [[composite material|composite structure]], not in the precipitation of the mineral components.<ref name="Bengtson2004" /> Skeletonisation also appeared at almost exactly the same time that animals started burrowing to avoid predation, and one of the earliest exoskeletons was made of glued-together mineral flakes, suggesting that skeletonisation was likewise a response to increased pressure from predators.<ref name=Dzik2007 />

Ocean chemistry may also control which mineral shells are constructed of. Calcium carbonate has two forms, the stable calcite, and the [[Metastability|metastable]] [[aragonite]], which is stable within a reasonable range of chemical environments but rapidly becomes unstable outside this range. When the oceans contain a relatively high proportion of magnesium compared to calcium, aragonite is more stable, but as the magnesium concentration drops, it becomes less stable, hence harder to incorporate into an exoskeleton, as it will tend to dissolve.

With the exception of the mollusks, whose shells often comprise both forms, most lineages use just one form of the mineral. The form used appears to reflect the seawater chemistry – thus which form was more easily precipitated – at the time that the lineage first evolved a calcified skeleton, and does not change thereafter.<ref name=Porter2007/> However, the relative abundance of calcite- and aragonite-using lineages does not reflect subsequent seawater chemistry – the magnesium/calcium ratio of the oceans appears to have a negligible impact on organisms' success, which is instead controlled mainly by how well they recover from mass extinctions.<ref name=Kiessling2008>{{cite journal| author = Wolfgang Kiessling, Martin Aberhan & Loïc Villier| year = 2008| title = Phanerozoic trends in skeletal mineralogy driven by mass extinctions| journal = [[Nature Geoscience]]| doi = 10.1038/ngeo251| volume = 1| pages = 527–530| issue=8|bibcode = 2008NatGe...1..527K }}</ref> A recently-discovered<ref name=Waren2003>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1087696 | pmid = 14605361 | year = 2003 | author=Anders Warén, Stefan Bengtson, Shana K.

== Artificial "exoskeletons" ==
[[Human]]s have long used [[armor]] as an artificial exoskeleton for protection, especially in combat. Exoskeletal machines (also called [[powered exoskeleton]]s) are also starting to be used for medical and industrial purposes, while powered human exoskeletons are a feature of science fiction writing, they are also currently moving into prototype stage.

[[Orthotics|Orthoses]] are a limited, medical form of exoskeleton. An orthosis (plural ''orthoses'') is a device which attaches to a limb, or the torso, to support the function or correct the shape of that limb or the spine. [[Orthotics]] is the field dealing with orthoses, their use, and their manufacture. An [[orthotist]] is a person who designs and fits orthoses. A [[prosthesis]] (plural ''prostheses'') is a device that substitutes for a missing part of a limb. If the prosthesis is a hollow shell and self-carrying, it is exoskeletal. If internal tubes are used in the device and the cover ([[cosmesis]]) to create the outside shape is made of a soft, non-carrying material, it is endoskeletal. Prosthetics is the field that deals with prostheses, use, and their manufacture. A [[prosthetist]] is a person who designs and fits prostheses.

Perhaps the first animals to use a naturally-occurring "artificial exoskeleton" were the [[hermit crab]]s,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}  the majority of which are obliged constantly to "wear" an empty gastropod shell, in order to protect their soft abdomens.

Parenthetically, the exoskeleton has been used as an architectural model as in the [[St. Martin Island Light]]. The building technique is called [[monocoque]], and is used in architecture and in construction of [[car]]s and [[aeroplane]]s.
