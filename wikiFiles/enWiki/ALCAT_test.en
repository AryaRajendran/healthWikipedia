The '''ALCAT test''', or '''antigen leukocyte antibody test''', is one that claims to measure adverse reactions to dietary substances. It  was created by American Medical Testing Laboratories and is now marketed by Cell Science Systems (also known as ALCAT Diagnostic Systems) of [[Deerfield Beach, Florida]]. 

The test is not supported by research and is not considered to be a reliable medical diagnostic tool; since it has not been appropriately [[Validation (drug manufacture)|validated]] it is not a suitable guide for therapeutic decisions.<ref name="pmid16047707"> {{cite journal |author=Wüthrich B |title=Unproven techniques in allergy diagnosis |journal=J Investig Allergol Clin Immunol |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=86–90 |year=2005 |pmid=16047707 |url=http://www.jiaci.org/issues/vol15issue02/1.pdf |format=pdf}}</ref><ref name="pmid20200768">{{cite journal |journal=Singapore Med J  |date=2010 Jan |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=4–9 |title=Diagnostic tests for food allergy |author=Gerez IF, Shek LP, Chng HH, Lee BW |pmid=20200768 |url=http://smj.sma.org.sg/5101/5101ra1.pdf}}</ref><ref name="pmid16097911">{{cite journal |journal=Med J Aust |year=2005 |volume=183 |issue=4 |pages=173–4 |author=Mullins Raymond J, Heddle Robert J, Smith Pete |title=Non-conventional approaches to allergy testing: reconciling patient autonomy with medical practitioners’ concerns |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/183_04_150805/mul10358_fm.html|quote=|pmid=16097911}}</ref><ref name="pmid9538667">{{cite journal| author=| title=Evaluation of the cytotoxic food test and the ALCAT (antigen leukocyte cellular antibody test) | journal=Pol Merkur Lekarski | year= 1997 | volume= 2 | issue= 8 | pages= 154–9 | pmid=9538667 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=9538667  }} </ref><ref name="pmid14653218">{{cite journal| author=Yasuhara A, Yamazaki D| title=The method of utilizing food allergy test. | journal=Rinsho Byori | year= 2003 | volume= Suppl 127 | issue=  | pages= 73–8 | pmid=14653218 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=14653218}}</ref><ref name="pmid19052505">{{cite journal| author=Ito K| title=Practical diagnosis of food allergy. | journal=Arerugi | year= 2008 | volume= 57 | issue= 11 | pages= 1109–16 | pmid=19052505 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=19052505  }}</ref> In a position statement, the [[Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy]] classified the ALCAT with other forms of cytotoxic tests as [[inappropriate test]]s, saying of them<blockquote>"These results have been shown to not be reproducible, give different results when duplicate samples are analysed blindly, don't correlate with those from conventional testing, and 'diagnose' food hypersensitivity in subjects with conditions where food allergy is not considered to play a pathogenic role."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allergy.org.au/health-professionals/papers/unorthodox-techniques-for-diagnosis-and-treatment#s4|publisher=Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy|title=Unorthodox Techniques for the Diagnosis and Treatment of allergy, Asthma and Immune Disorders|accessdate=2012-10-09|date=November 2007}}</ref></blockquote>
