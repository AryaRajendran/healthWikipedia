'''Ann Preston''' (December 1, 1813 – April 18, 1872) was an [[United States|American]] doctor and educator.

==Biography==
Born in [[West Grove, Pennsylvania]], as one of eight siblings, she was raised as a [[Quaker]] by a Quaker minister Amos and his wife Margaret (née Smith) Preston. Three of the children were girls, but Ann was the only one to survive until adulthood. She was educated in a local school then attended a boarding school in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]]. However, she had to return home to care for her mother, who was terminally ill.<ref name=nlm/>

She became a member of the [[temperance movement]] and the Clarkson [[Anti-Slavery Society]]. After her younger brothers were old enough to care for themselves, she worked as a schoolteacher. In 1849, she published a book of nursery rhymes, ''Cousin Ann's Stories''. By the 1840s, she became interested in educating women about their bodies and taught all-female classes on hygiene and physiology.<ref name=nlm/> She was privately educated in medicine by Nathaniel Moseley from 1847–1849. Unable to gain admittance to male medical school because of biases against women, she entered the Quaker-run [[Female Medical College of Pennsylvania]] when it first opened, where she was one of five women awarded an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in 1851.<ref name=ogilvie_harvey2000/>

Dr. Preston returned to the college the following year for postgraduate work, then ran a series of lectures on hygiene for women. Beginning in 1853 she was a professor of physiology and hygiene at the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania. During the [[American Civil War]], the college was closed due to lack of financial support. Preston began to suffer from [[rheumatic fever]] and exhaustion at this time. She was confined to [[Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane]] for three months to recuperate.<ref name=ogilvie_harvey2000/>

After the college was re-opened, student [[Mary Putnam Jacobi]] was refused a medical degree by Edwin Fussel, even though she met the required qualifications. This resulted in a rift among the staff because most of them, including Dr. Preston, disagreed with the decision. Fussell
resigned following the incident<ref name=windsor2002/> and Preston became [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the college from 1866–1872.

She was the first woman to become the dean of a medical school, a position that allowed her to champion the right of women to become physicians.<ref name=ogilvie_harvey2000/><ref name=derosa2005/> In 1867 the [[Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia County]] Medical Society objected to the practice of medicine by women, and Preston's defense disarmed much of the adverse criticism.<ref name=acab>{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Preston, Ann|year=1892}}</ref>

In 1871 she suffered from an attack of acute articular [[rheumatism]], which left her in a weakened state. She suffered a relapse the following year and died on April 18, 1872.<ref name=kelly1912/>
