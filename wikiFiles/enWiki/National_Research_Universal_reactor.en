The '''National Research Universal''' (NRU) '''reactor''' is a 135 MWt nuclear research reactor built in the [[Chalk River Laboratories]], [[Ontario]], one of [[Canada]]’s national science facilities. It is a multipurpose science facility that serves three main roles. It generates [[nuclear medicine|isotopes]] used to treat or diagnose over 20 million people in 80 countries every year (and, to a lesser extent, other isotopes used for non-medical purposes). It is the neutron source for the [[National Research Council of Canada|NRC]] [[Canadian Neutron Beam Centre]]: a materials research centre that grew from the Nobel Prize-winning work of [[Bertram Brockhouse]]. It is the test bed for [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] to develop fuels and materials for the [[CANDU reactor]].

==History==
The NRU reactor design was started in 1949, and is fundamentally a Canadian design{{Cn|date=March 2012}}, significantly advanced from NRX. It was built as the successor to the NRX reactor at the Atomic Energy Project of the [[National Research Council of Canada]] at [[Chalk River Laboratories]]. The NRX reactor was the world's most intense source of [[neutron]]s when it started operation in 1947 and had attracted a large scientific community who were using those neutrons in research that was then possible for the first time.<ref name="eggleston">W. Eggleston, Canada's Nuclear Story, Pub. Clarke Irwin and Co. 1965</ref> It was not known how long a research reactor could be expected to operate so the management of Chalk River Laboratories began planning the NRU reactor to ensure continuity of the research programs.<ref name="eggleston" />

NRU started self-sustained operation (or went "critical") on November 3, 1957, a decade after NRX, and was ten times more powerful. It was initially designed as a 200 MW reactor, fueled with [[natural uranium]]. NRU was converted to 60 MW with highly-[[enriched uranium]] (HEU) fuel in 1964 and converted a third time in 1991 to 135 MW running on low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel.

On 24 May 1958 the NRU suffered a major accident.<ref>[http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#nru1958 The Canadian Nuclear FAQ - Section D: Safety and Liability<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://archives.cbc.ca/IDCC-1-75-104-911/science_technology/candu/ An accident at NRU - Candu: The Canadian Nuclear Reactor - Science and Technology - CBC Archives<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A damaged uranium [[fuel rod]] caught fire and was torn in two as it was being removed from the core. The fire was extinguished, but a sizeable quantity of [[radioactive]] combustion products had contaminated the interior of the reactor building and, to a lesser degree, an area of the surrounding laboratory site. The clean-up and repair took three months. NRU was operating again in August 1958. Care was taken to ensure no one was exposed to dangerous levels of radiation and staff involved in clean-up were monitored over the following decades.<ref>Myers, D.K., Morrison, D.P. and Werner, M.M., "Follow-up of AECL employees involved in the decontamination of NRU in 1958", AECL Report, AECL-7901, 1982 September 1.</ref> No health effects were observed.

NRU's calandria, the vessel which contains its nuclear reactions, is made of [[aluminum]], and was replaced in 1971 because of corrosion. But it has not been replaced since, although this second replacement is likely needed. A complete shutdown of perhaps one year would be needed for the replacement. One strong advantage of NRU's design is that it can be taken apart to allow for replacements such as this. Since NRX was decommissioned in 1992, after 45 years of service, there has been no backup for NRU.

In October 1986, the NRU reactor was recognized as a nuclear historic landmark by the [[American Nuclear Society]].<ref>[http://www.ans.org/honors/recipients/va-nuclandmark ANS : Honors and Awards : Recipients : Nuclear Historic Landmark Award<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 1994, Bertram Brockhouse was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], for his pioneering work carried out in the NRX and NRU reactors in the 1950s. He gave birth to a scientific technique which is now used around the world.<ref>[http://neutron.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/brock_e.html Brockhouse and the Nobel Prize - Canadian Neutron Beam Centre<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 1996, [[AECL]] informed the [[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission]] (then known as the [[Atomic Energy Control Board]]) that operation of the NRU reactor would not continue beyond December 31, 2005. It was expected that a replacement facility would be built inside that time. However, no replacement was built and in 2003, AECL advised the CNSC that they intended to continue operation of the NRU reactor beyond December 2005. The operating licence was initially extended to July 31, 2006, and a 63-month licence renewal was obtained in July 2006, allowing full operating of NRU until October 31, 2011.<ref>[http://www.aecl.ca/NewsRoom/News/Press-2006/060731.htm "CNSC Approves Renewal of AECL's Chalk River Site Operating Licence"] AECL, July 31, 2006. URL accessed August 8, 2006.</ref>

In May 2007, the NRU reactor set a new record for the production of medical isotopes.<ref>[http://www.aecl.ca/NewsRoom/Bulletins/E-0706/E05.htm Email Bulletin - 2007 June - Nearing 50, National Research Universal Still Setting Records<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In June 2007, a new [[neutron scattering]] instrument was opened in NRU.<ref>[http://neutron.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/news/reflectom_e.html Canada's first Neutron Reflectometer Officially Open - Canadian Neutron Beam Centre<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The D3 Neutron Reflectometer is designed for examining surfaces, thin films and interfaces. The technique of [[Neutron Reflectometry]] is relatively new, and capable of providing unique information on materials in the nanometre length scale.

===2007 shutdown===

On November 18, 2007, the National Research Universal reactor, which makes medical radioisotopes, was shut down for routine maintenance.  This shutdown was voluntarily extended when AECL decided to install seismically-qualified emergency power systems (EPS) to two of the reactor's cooling pumps (in addition to the AC and DC backup power systems already in place), which had been required as part of its August 2006 operating license issued by the [[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission]] (CNSC), whose staff had discovered that the status of the NRU facility was not in compliance with CNSC license conditions. This resulted in a worldwide shortage of radioisotopes for medical treatments because Chalk River makes the majority of the world's supply of radioisotopes, (including two-thirds of the world's [[technetium-99]]<ref>[http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/highlights/2006/0605chalkriver_e.html NRC's Diamond in the Rough] National Research Council Canada's website</ref>) and because AECL had not pre-arranged for an alternate supply.  On December 11, 2007, the [[Canadian House of Commons]], acting on what the government described as "independent expert" advice, passed emergency legislation authorizing the restarting of the NRU reactor with one of the two seismic connections complete (one pump being sufficient to cool the core), and authorizing the reactor's operation for 120 days without CNSC approval.  The legislation, C-38, was passed by the Senate and received Royal Assent on December 12. Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] accused the "Liberal-appointed" CNSC for this shutdown which "jeopardized the health and safety of tens of thousands of Canadians".  Others viewed the actions and priorities of the Prime Minister and government in terms of protecting the eventual sale of AECL to private investors.<ref>"[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071211.wisotope1211/BNStory/National/] theglobeandmail.com pay-site"</ref><ref>"David Ljunggren, [http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1154689120071213 Canadian parliament orders isotope reactor restart] Reuters.com"</ref><ref>"Peter Calamai, [http://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/285210 Future of AECL, Candu may figure in push to reopen Chalk River] thestar.com"</ref><ref>"CBC News, [http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/12/13/chalk-river-reactor.html Chalk River plant to begin making radioisotopes in a week] CBC.ca"</ref>  The government later announced plans to sell part of AECL in May 2009.<ref>"CBC News, [http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2009/05/28/aecl-future-sale.html Canada eyes sale of stake in AECL reactor business] CBC.ca, retrieved May 31, 2009"</ref>

The NRU reactor was restarted on December 16, 2007.

On January 29, 2008, the [[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission#Political storm over dismissal of CNSC chair|former President]] of the CNSC, Linda Keen, testified before a Parliamentary Committee that the risk of fuel failure in the NRU reactor was "1 in 1000 years", and claimed this to be a thousand times greater risk than the "international standard".  These claims were refuted by AECL.<ref>[http://www.aecl.ca/NewsRoom/News/Press-2008/080129.htm 2008 News Releases - AECL Clarifies Inaccurate Statements by Former CNSC CEO Linda Keen]</ref>

On February 2, 2008 the second seismic connection was complete.  This timing was well within the above 120-day window afforded by Bill C-38.

===2009 Shutdown===

In mid-May 2009 a heavy water leak at the base of the reactor vessel was detected prompting a temporary shutdown of the reactor.  The leak was estimated to be 5KG (<5 litres) per hour and determined to be due to corrosion. This was the second heavy water leak since late 2008. The reactor was defuelled and drained of all of its heavy water moderator. No administrative levels of radioactivity were exceeded, during the leak or defuelling, and all leaked water was contained and treated on site.

The reactor remained shut down until [http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2010/08/18/isotopes-medical-chalk-river-aecl.html August 2010]. The lengthy shutdown was necessary to first completely defuel the entire reactor, then ascertain the full extent of the corrosion to the vessel, and finally to effect the repairs&nbsp;— all with remote and restricted access from a minimum distance of 8 metres due to the residual radioactive fields in the reactor vessel. The 2009 shutdown occurred at a time when only one of the other four worldwide regular medical isotope sourcing reactors was producing, resulting in a worldwide shortage.

==Production of isotopes==
{| cellpadding="10" border="1" style="width:400px; float:right; background:#eee;"
|-
| [[Atom]]s are the building blocks of nature. The [[periodic table]] of the elements lists as many as 118 different types of [[atom]], called ''elements'', such as [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]] or [[carbon]]. Atoms of any element can occur in more than one weight, depending on the number of [[neutron]]s they contain. Two atoms of [[carbon]] for instance may weigh 12 and 13 [[Atomic mass unit|a.m.u.]]. They are both carbon atoms, but one has an extra neutron. They are referred to as ''[[isotope]]s'' of carbon.

Not all [[isotope]]s are stable. An unstable isotope will [[Radioactive decay|decay]] to a more stable state, releasing energy and possibly one or more particles. These particles and/or the energy emitted by said ''[[radionuclides|radioisotopes]]'' is used in a great variety of medical, industrial and scientific applications.
|}

With the construction of the earlier [[NRX]] reactor, it was possible for the first time to commercially manufacture isotopes that were not commonly found in nature. In the core of an operating reactor there are billions of [[free neutron]]s. By inserting a piece of target material into the core, atoms in the target can capture some of those neutrons and become heavier isotopes. Manufacturing medical isotopes was a Canadian medical innovation in the early 1950s.

The NRU reactor continued the legacy of NRX and today produces more medical isotopes than any facility in the world.
*[[Cobalt-60]] from NRU is used in [[Radiation therapy]] machines that treat cancer in 15 million patients in 80 counties each year.<ref>http://www.cna.ca/english/Nuclear_Facts/CNA_Best_Kept_Secret_August04.pdf</ref> The NRU produces about 75% of the global supply.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.mds.nordion.com/about/about.htm MDS Nordion - We Make a Difference<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Cobalt-60 emits a lot of energy as it decays, enough to kill a cancer cell.
*[[Technetium-99m]] from NRU is used in the diagnosis of 5 million patients each year,<ref>http://www.cna.ca/seminar2007/docs/DrCoulombespeech.pdf</ref> representing about 80 per cent of all nuclear medicine procedures.<ref>[http://www.mds.nordion.com/products/medical-isotopes-molybdenum-99.htm MDS Nordion - Medical Isotopes - Molybdenum-99<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The NRU produces over half of the world's total supply.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Technetium-99m emits less energy as it decays than most gamma emitters, roughly as much as the X-rays from an X-ray tube.  This can act as an ''in situ'' source for a special camera that creates an image of the patient called a [[SPECT scan]].  NRU actually produces the more stable parent isotope, [[molybdenum-99]], which is shipped to medical labs.  There it decays into [[technetium-99m]], which is separated and used for testing.<ref>See [[Technetium-99m generator|Technetium cow]] for details.</ref>
*NRU produces xenon-133, iodine-131 and iodine-125, which are used in a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications.
*[[Carbon-14]] produced in NRU is sold to chemistry, bioscience and environmental labs to use as a [[Carbon label|tracer]].
* Iridium-192 from NRU is used in several industries to [[Industrial radiography#Inspection of welds|inspect welds]] or other metal components to ensure they are safe for use.

The core of the NRU reactor is about 3 m wide and 3 m high, which is unusually large for a research reactor. That large volume enables the bulk production of isotopes. Other research reactors in the world produce isotopes for medical and industrial uses, for example the European [[Petten nuclear reactor|High Flux Reactor]] at Petten in the Netherlands, and the [[OPAL]] reactor in Australia which began operation in April 2007.

==Neutron beam research==
The NRU reactor is home to Canada's national facility for [[neutron scattering]]: the [[National Research Council of Canada|NRC]] [[Canadian Neutron Beam Centre]]. Neutron scattering is a technique where a beam of neutrons shines through a sample of material, and depending on how the neutrons scatter from the atoms inside, scientists can determine many details about the crystal structure and movements of the atoms within the sample.

An early pioneer of the technique was Bertram Brockhouse who built some of the early neutron spectrometers in the NRX and NRU reactors and was awarded the 1994 Nobel Prize in physics for the development of [[Neutron triple-axis spectrometry|neutron spectroscopy]].<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1994/ Physics 1994<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The NRC Canadian Neutron Beam Centre continues that field of science today, operating as an open-access user facility allowing scientists from across Canada and around the world to use neutrons in their research programs.

It is common for a developed country to support a national facility for neutron scattering and one for [[X-ray scattering techniques|X-ray scattering]]. The two types of facility provide complementary information about materials.

An unusual feature of the NRU reactor as Canada's national neutron source is its multipurpose design: able to manufacture isotopes, and support nuclear R&D at the same time as it supplies neutrons to the suite of neutron scattering instruments.

The NRU reactor is sometimes (incorrectly) characterized as simply a ''nuclear'' research facility. Neutron scattering however is not [[Nuclear physics|nuclear research]], it is ''materials research''. Neutrons are an ideal probe of materials including metals, alloys, biomaterials, ceramics, magnetic materials, minerals, polymers, composites, glasses, nano-materials and many others. The neutron scattering instruments at the [[National Research Council of Canada|NRC]] [[Canadian Neutron Beam Centre]] are used by universities and industries from across Canada every year because knowledge of materials is important for innovation in many sectors.<ref>[http://neutron.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/home_e.html Welcome to the Canadian Neutron Beam Centre - Canadian Neutron Beam Centre<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Nuclear power research and development==
{| cellpadding="10" border="1" style="width:400px; float:right; background:#eee;"
| Inside the core of a large electricity-producing reactor like a [[CANDU]] or a [[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]], there are a great many [[free neutron]]s and high levels of [[gamma radiation]] from the [[nuclear fission]] process. It is important for engineers and scientists to understand how that environment will affect the materials that the reactor is made from. That knowledge is needed to design a reactor with a long service-life.
|}
The NRU reactor has test facilities built into its core that can replicate conditions inside a large electricity-producing reactor. NRU itself does not generate steam (or electricity); its cooling water heats up to approximately 55 degrees Celsius. Inside the test facilities though, high temperatures and pressures can be produced. It is essential to test out different materials before they are used in the construction of a nuclear generating station.

The fundamental knowledge gained from NRU enabled the development of the [[CANDU reactor]], and is the foundation for the [[Nuclear power in Canada|Canadian nuclear industry]].
