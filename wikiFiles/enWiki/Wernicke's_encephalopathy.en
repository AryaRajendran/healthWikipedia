'''Wernicke's encephalopathy''' is a [[syndrome]] characterised by [[ataxia]], [[ophthalmoplegia]], [[nystagmus]], confusion, and impairment of [[short-term memory]].<ref name="Aminoff">Aminoff, Michael J., Greenberg, David A., Simon, Roger P. (2005) ''Clinical Neurology (6th ed.),'' page 113. Lange Medical Books/McGraw-Hill. ISBN 0-07-142360-5</ref><ref name="Beers">Beers, Mark H. et al. (2006), ''The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy (18th ed.),'' pages 1688-1689. Merck Research Laboratories 2006, ISBN 0-911910-18-2</ref> It is caused by lesions in the medial [[thalamic nuclei]], [[mammillary bodies]], periaqueductal and periventricular brainstem nuclei, and superior cerebellar vermis, often resulting from inadequate intake or absorption of [[thiamine]] ([[Vitamin B1|vitamin B<sub>1</sub>]]), especially in conjunction with [[carbohydrate]] ingestion.

Wernicke's encephalopathy is most commonly correlated with prolonged alcohol consumption resulting in thiamine deficiency. [[Alcoholism|Alcoholics]] are therefore particularly at risk, but it may also occur with thiamine deficiency states arising from other causes, particularly in patients with such digestive system disorders as [[carcinoid syndrome]], chronic gastritis, [[Crohn's disease]], and repetitive vomiting, particularly after [[bariatric surgery]].<ref name="pmid18948797">{{cite journal |author=Aasheim ET |title=Wernicke encephalopathy after bariatric surgery: a systematic review |journal=Ann. Surg. |volume=248 |issue=5 |pages=714–20 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=18948797 |doi=10.1097/SLA.0b013e3181884308}}</ref> Despite its name, Wernicke's encephalopathy is not related to [[Wernicke's area]], a region of the brain associated with speech and language interpretation, although both were described by the German neurologist [[Carl Wernicke]] (1848–1905).

==Signs and symptoms==
Wernicke's encephalopathy begins abruptly, usually with eye movement disorders ([[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], [[gaze palsies]], and [[ophthalmoplegia]], especially of the lateral rectus muscles), [[gait ataxia]], [[confusion]], [[confabulation]], and short-term memory loss.

The classic triad of the syndrome is confusion, [[ophthalmoplegia]] (eye paralysis), and [[ataxia]] (loss of coordination), though these are only seen in combination in 10% of cases.<ref>Trust Protocol:The Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals, [http://www.newcastle-hospitals.org.uk/downloads/clinical-guidelines/Internal%20Medicine/Alcohol_withdrawal.pdf] accessed 10th August 2011.</ref> Untreated it may progress to [[Korsakoff's psychosis]], [[coma]] and death.<ref name="Aminoff"/><ref name="Beers"/> The pathological changes seen in Wernicke's encephalopathy are concentrated in the [[mammillary bodies]], [[cranial nerve nuclei]] III, IV, VI and VIII, the [[thalamus]], [[hypothalamus]], [[periaqueductal grey]], [[cerebellar vermis]], and the [[dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve]]. The ataxia and ophthalmoparesis are related to lesions in the oculomotor, trochlear, abducens, and vestibular (IIIrd, IVth, VIth, and VIIIth cranial) nerve nuclei. 

==Mechanism==
The [[neuropathy]] of Wernicke's encephalopathy  causes [[neuron]] death due to the effects of [[thiamine deficiency]] upon [[astrocyte]]s. This causes alterations in their [[glutamate]] uptake, through changes in the levels of the astrocytic glutamate transporters [[EAAT1]] and [[EAAT2]] creating [[excitotoxicity]]. Other changes include those to the [[GABA]] transporter subtype [[GAT-3]], [[GFAP]], [[glutamine synthetase]], the water channel protein [[Aquaporin 4]]. These create [[lactic acidosis]], [[brain edema]], [[oxidative stress]], [[inflammation]], and [[white matter]] damage.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hazell | first1 = AS | title = Astrocytes are a major target in thiamine deficiency and Wernicke's encephalopathy | journal = Neurochemistry international | volume = 55 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 129–35 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19428817 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuint.2009.02.020 }}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment begins with [[intravenous]] or [[intramuscular]] [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] of [[thiamine]], followed by assessment of [[central nervous system]] and metabolic conditions. In the presence of sub-clinical thiamine deficiency, a large dose of sugar (especially glucose) can precipitate the onset of overt encephalopathy;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zimitat C, Nixon PF |title=Glucose loading precipitates acute encephalopathy in thiamin-deficient rats |journal=Metab Brain Dis |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=1–20 |year=1999 |pmid=10348310 |doi=10.1023/A:1020653312697 |url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0885-7490&volume=14&page=1}}</ref> therefore, correcting hypoglycemia should not be attempted before thiamine replenishment. Rehydration to restore [[blood volume]] should follow, as needed.

Prognosis depends on severity. When treated early, recovery is normally rapid and complete. Established Wernicke's encephalopathy, by contrast, can have serious long-term consequences, with patients requiring permanent in-patient care.<ref>NHS Fife Pharmacy Services.
