'''Tropicamide''' ('''Mydriacyl''') is an [[anticholinergic]] used as a [[mydriatic]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Effects of anticholinergic drugs selective for muscarinic receptor subtypes on prepulse inhibition in mice |author=Makoto Ukai, Ami Okuda, Takayoshi Mamiya |journal=European Journal of Pharmacology |volume=492 |issue=2–3 |year=2004 |pages=183–187 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299904003383}}</ref>

== Uses ==

Tropicamide is an antimuscarinic drug that produces short acting [[mydriasis]] (dilation of the [[pupil]]) and [[cycloplegia]]<ref name="pmid11431435">{{cite journal |author=Manny RE, Hussein M, Scheiman M, Kurtz D, Niemann K, Zinzer K |title=Tropicamide (1%): an effective cycloplegic agent for myopic children |journal=Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science |volume=42 |issue=8 |pages=1728–35 |year=2001 |month=July |pmid=11431435 |doi= |url=http://www.iovs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11431435}}</ref> when applied as [[eye drop]]s. It is used to allow better examination of the [[lens (anatomy)|lens]], [[vitreous humor]], and [[retina]]. Due to its relatively short duration of effect (4&ndash;8 hours), it is typically used during [[eye examination]]s such as the [[dilated fundus examination]], but it may also be used before or after [[eye surgery]].  Cycloplegic drops are often also used to treat anterior [[uveitis]], decreasing risk of posterior [[Synechia (eye)|synechiae]] and decreasing inflammation in the anterior chamber of the eye.

[[Image:Anizokoria.JPG|thumb|left|210px|alt=Right eye was instilled with tropicamide, leading to [[mydriasis]] and therefore [[anisocoria]] (unequal pupil size)|[[Anisocoria]] caused by Tropicamide instilled into the right eye only.]]
Tropicamide is occasionally administered in combination with [[p-Hydroxyamphetamine|p-hydroxyamphetamine]] (brand name [[Paremyd]]), which is a [[sympathomimetic]].  The use of the sympathomimetic drug causes the iris dilator muscle to be directly stimulated, causing increased dilation.  In the United States, the sympathomimetic drop most commonly used along with tropicamide, is 2.5% [[phenylephrine]] hydrochloride (brand name AK-Dilate).

== Side effects ==

Tropicamide induces transient stinging and a slight and transient rise in [[intraocular pressure]] in the majority of patients. It may cause redness or [[conjunctivitis]] (inflammation) and also [[Defocus aberration|blurs]] near vision for a short while after instillation (care must be taken, and the patient must only drive when vision returns to normal). Tropicamide may, in very rare cases [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1325111/], cause an attack of [[Glaucoma#Classification|acute angle-closure glaucoma]]. This tends to be in patients with narrow [[anterior chamber]] [[trabecular meshwork|angles]], and closure risk must be assessed by the practitioner prior to instillation.

Tropicamide is often preferred to [[atropine]] because atropine has a longer [[half-life]], causing prolonged dilation and blurry vision for up to a week. Atropine has less sting effect, but can be toxic or fatal if ingested in large quantities by children or adults.

Systemic side effects are very rare.

== Illicit use ==

In Russia, it is used to some degree as an inexpensive recreational drug. Like other [[anticholinergics]], when taken recreationally, tropicamide acts as a [[deliriant]]. According to one reporter, when injected intravenously, the drug often "brings on suicidal feelings."<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/krokodil-the-drug-that-eats-junkies-2300787.html Krokodil: The drug that eats junkies]</ref>
