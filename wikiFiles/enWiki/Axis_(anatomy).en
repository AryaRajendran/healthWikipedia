In [[anatomy]], the second [[cervical vertebra]] (C2) of the [[vertebral column|spine]] is named the '''axis''' (from Latin ''axis'', "axle") or '''epistropheus'''. 

It forms the pivot upon which the first cervical [[vertebra]] (the [[atlas (anatomy)|atlas]]), which carries the [[head (anatomy)|head]], rotates. 

The most distinctive characteristic of this [[bone]] is the strong [[odontoid process]] ("dens") which rises perpendicularly from the upper surface of the body.  That peculiar feature gives to the vertebra a rarely used third name:  '''vertebra dentata'''.  In some [[Hanging|judicial hangings]] the odontoid process may break and hit the medulla oblongata, causing death.

== The body ==
The body is deeper in front than behind, and prolonged downward anteriorly so as to overlap the upper and front part of the third vertebra.

It presents in front a median longitudinal ridge, separating two lateral depressions for the attachment of the ''[[Longus colli]]'' [[muscle]]s. 

Its under surface is concave from before backward and convex from side to side.

== Other features ==
The [[dens (anatomy)|dens]], or [[odontoid process]], exhibits a slight constriction or neck where it joins the body. 

The [[pedicle of vertebral arch|pedicles]] are broad and strong, especially in front, where they coalesce with the sides of the body and the root of the odontoid process. They are covered above by the superior articular surfaces. 

The [[lamina of the vertebral arch|laminae]] are thick and strong, and the [[vertebral foramen]] large, but smaller than that of the [[Atlas_(anatomy)|atlas]]. 

The [[transverse processes]] are very small, and each ends in a single tubercle; each is perforated by the [[transverse foramen]], which is directed obliquely upward and laterally. 

The superior [[articular surface]]s are round, slightly convex, directed upward and laterally, and are supported on the body, pedicles, and transverse processes. 

The inferior [[articular surface]]s have the same direction as those of the other [[cervical vertebrae]]. 

The superior [[vertebral notches]] are very shallow, and lie behind the [[articular processes]]; the inferior lie in front of the articular processes, as in the other cervical vertebrae. 

The [[spinous process]] is large, very strong, deeply channelled on its under surface, and presents a [[bifid rib|bifid]], [[tuberculated]] extremity.
