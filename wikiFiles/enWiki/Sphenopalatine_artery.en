The '''sphenopalatine artery''' ('''nasopalatine artery''') is an [[artery]] of the head, commonly known as the '''artery of [[Nosebleed|epistaxis]]'''.<ref>[http://drbatraent.com/archives/8 Dr.Padampreet Singh Batra’s ENT , Head and Neck » Blog Archive » Epistaxis (NASAL BLEEDING)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Course==
The sphenopalatine artery is a branch of the [[maxillary artery]] which passes through the [[sphenopalatine foramen]] into the cavity of the [[Human nose|nose]], at the back part of the [[superior meatus]]. Here it gives off its [[posterior lateral nasal branches]].

Crossing the under surface of the sphenoid, the sphenopalatine artery ends on the [[nasal septum]] as the [[posterior septal branches]].  Here it will [[anastomosis|anastomose]] with the branches of the [[greater palatine artery]].

==Clinical significance==
The sphenopalatine artery is the artery responsible for the most serious, posterior nosebleeds (also known as as epistaxis). It can be ligated surgically to control such nosebleeds.
