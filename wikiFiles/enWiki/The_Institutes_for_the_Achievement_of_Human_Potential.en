'''The Institutes for The Achievement of Human Potential''' is a [[non-profit organization]] providing teaching programs and literature which it promotes as improving the health and [[neurological]] development of normal children and of children who have sustained a brain injury. 

Although the institute's programs were supported by some notable individuals such as [[Linus Pauling]] (1901–1994) and [[Raymond Dart]] (1893–1988), their programs for brain injured children have been widely criticized.<ref name="robards1994"/> According to the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], the institute's patterning treatment is based on an outmoded and oversimplified theory of [[brain development]], its effectiveness is not supported by [[evidence-based medicine]], and its use is unwarranted.<ref name=pediatrics/> 

IAHP has its own journal titled ''In-Report'', which publishes results that are to be shared among fellow professionals.<ref>[http://www.iahp.org/The-Journal-of-the-Institutes-T.220+M52087573ab0.0.html "IN-REPORT"], Institutes for The Achievement of Human Potential</ref>

==History==
Founded in 1955, the Institutes for The Achievement of Human Potential (IAHP, also known as "The Institutes") is located in [[Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania|Wyndmoor, Pa.]], a suburb of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. The founder, [[Glenn Doman]] (a [[physical therapist]]), together with [[Carl Delacato]] (an educational [[psychologist]]), developed an approach to treating children with brain injury,  published in 1960 in the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] (JAMA).<ref name="doman1960">{{cite journal | author=Doman RJ, Spitz EB, Zucman E, Delacato CH, Doman G | title=Children with severe brain injuries.

Another aspect of the IAHP's theories is that a lack of oxygen to the brain is a key cause of many problems in brain-injured children. The IAHP asserts that their program includes techniques that improve this oxygen supply, and that increased oxygen to the brain will help their patients recover.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==Programs==
===Programs for brain-injured children===
Before initiation of an IAHP program with their "brain-injured" children, parents attend a five day seminar that the IAHP presents called the "What To Do About Your Brain-Injured Child Course". The IAHP states that this course gives a good basis of understanding of their programs to parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iahp.org/What-To-Do-About-Your-Brain-Inju.28.0.html |title=IAHP website |publisher=Iahp.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-09}}</ref> This course is presented in [[Philadelphia]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], and [[Singapore]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iahp.org/Upcoming-Courses.37.0.html |title=Upcoming Courses |publisher=iahp.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-09}}</ref>

The program for "brain-injured" children includes:

* ''Patterning'' – manipulation of limbs and head in a rhythmic fashion
* ''Creeping'' – forward bodily movement with the abdomen in contact with the floor
* ''Crawling'' – forward bodily movement with the abdomen raised from the floor
* ''Receptive stimulation'' – visual, tactile and auditory stimulation
* ''Expressive activities'' – e.g. picking up objects
* ''Masking'' – breathing into a rebreathing mask to increase the amount of carbon dioxide inhaled, which is believed to increase cerebral blood flow
* ''Brachiation'' – swinging from a bar or vertical ladder
* ''Gravity/Antigravity activities'' – rolling, somersaulting and hanging upside down.

(The above is taken from ''Understanding Mental Retardation'', page 185-186.)<ref name="zigler1986">{{cite book

 | isbn = 0-521-31878-5

}}</ref>

The program is designed to be used by a parent at home. Patterning is perhaps the key technique. IAHP state "if we have to put everything we do on one hook, patterning is really not a bad place to hang our hat"<ref name="domanJanetPatterning">Janet Doman in an article "The Honorable Corps of Patterners" on the IAHP website.</ref> and "that if these patterns were applied rigorously, on a specific schedule, and done with a religious zeal, brain-injured kids improved." They believe the order of brain development occurs as higher brain stages are successively brought into play.<ref name=DevProf>The Institutes Developmental Profile, on the IAHP web site.</ref>

===Programs for well children===
The IAHP also provides programs and literature to the parents of well children. Glenn Doman believes that because the neurological development of brain injured children could be speeded, that the same should be true of well children. The IAHP provides a series of books and early education kits called the ''"Gentle Revolution Series"'', which state that their use will accelerate development of well children. For example, one program is "How to teach your baby to read"[http://www.gentlerevolution.com/mm5/merchant.mvc http://www.gentlerevolution.com].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The IAHP teaches a week-long seminar called the ''"How To Multiply Your Baby's Intelligence Course"'', which provides demonstrations of children taught with the IAHP's methods. The IAHP claims that at the course, "parents learn how to teach their children to read, how to learn a foreign language...mathematics, and music appreciation. Parents learn about sensory and motor development and the fundamentals of a good nutritional program for the family."<ref>The IAHP website:http://www.iahp.org/How-to-Multiply-Your-Baby.328.0.html</ref>

===Epilepsy treatment===
The IAHP requires that all brain-injured children be gradually weaned off [[anticonvulsant]]s. They claim that seizures are a "natural reflex defense response to a lethal threat to the brain",<ref name=autogenerated1>Glenn Doman and Dr. Ralph Peligra, "Ictogenesis: the origin of seizures in humans. A new look at an old theory." ''Medical Hypotheses'' Volume 10, Issue 1. pp. Pages 129–132 (January 2003)
</ref> but that the seizures themselves are not directly harmful to the brain. Instead of placing children on [[anticonvulsant]] medications, the IAHP claims that resources should be directed at "developing methods and bioactive agents that promote [[neuroplasticity]]", the brain's ability to grow and change.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iahp.org/Detoxification.302.0.html |title= Detoxification from anticonvulsants: 25 years of experience with brain-injured children |accessdate=2008-04-29 |author=Roselise H. Wilkinson, MD |publisher=IAHP |quote=...our rationale is also based on our strong belief that seizures serve a physiological function, as do the many other defense mechanisms of the body. Coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, fainting, and fever could also be viewed as dysfunctions, but we know that they are designed to protect the organism. So also are seizures. A seizure is an activity of great metabolic activity of the brain, and during its presence cerebral blood flow increases, providing more oxygen and glucose and increasing excitatory amino acids necessary for establishing the neuronal wiring and function.}}</ref> The IAHP asserts that [[status epilepticus]] can be caused by anticonvulsants and may be best left untreated by them. Instead, they believe that seizures can be reduced or eliminated by a "masking" program, which they claim periodically reduces oxygen intake and increases [[carbon dioxide]] intake. The IAHP also claims that seizures can be reduced by decreasing intake of salt and fluids, supplements of [[magnesium]] [[calcium]] and [[pyridoxine]], and a healthy diet and environment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iahp.org/Detoxification.302.0.html |title= Detoxification from anticonvulsants: 25 years of experience with brain-injured children |accessdate=2008-04-29 |author=Roselise H. Wilkinson, MD |publisher=IAHP |quote=Additional measures are: I. Optimize respiratory function to increase oxygen availability. II. Masking—a procedure of rebreathing for short periods to gain CO2 enrichment resulting in a favorable acid base balance and to increase cerebral circulation. This technique is useful to shorten individual seizures as well. III. Restriction of sodium and liquids to prevent fluid retention and increased intracranial pressure. IV. Excellent nutrition to maintain good health and structures and to provide for energy and all needed vitamins, minerals, and neurotransmitter precursors. V. Magnesium and calcium supplements to promote central nervous system membrane stability. VI. Pyridoxine to support GABA and to increase the efficient use of oxygen by the brain. VII. Control the environment: Pollution, toxins, hyperthermia, reduced oxygen availability. VIII. Maintain excellent health—avoidance of infections, etc.}}</ref>

==Scientific criticism==
The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] Committee on Children With Disabilities issued warnings regarding patterning, one of the IAHP's therapies for brain injured children, as early as 1968<ref name=AAP1968>American Academy of Pediatrics. Doman-Delacato treatment of neurologically handicapped children. ''AAP Newsletter''. June 1, 1968(suppl)</ref> and repeated in 1982.<ref name=AAP1982>American Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Children With Disabilities.

PMID 6182521</ref> Their latest cautionary policy statement was in 1999, which was reaffirmed in 2002 and 2005. It stated:<ref name=pediatrics>{{cite journal |author= Committee on Children with Disabilities, [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] |title= The treatment of neurologically impaired children using patterning |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=104 |issue= 5 Pt 1 |pages=1149–51 |year=1999 |pmid=10545565 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/104/5/1149 |doi= 10.1542/peds.104.5.1149}}</ref>

<blockquote>
This statement reviews patterning as a treatment for children with neurologic impairments. This treatment is based on an outmoded and oversimplified theory of brain development. Current information does not support the claims of proponents that this treatment is efficacious, and its use continues to be unwarranted.... [T]he demands and expectations placed on families are so great that in some cases their financial resources may be depleted substantially and parental and sibling relationships could be stressed.

Since 1960 the IAHP has published multiple studies professing to show the effectiveness of the program. These studies, upon review, have not stood up to scientific scrutiny and have not been reproduced by other sources.<ref name=western>{{cite journal | author= Holm VA | title= A western version of the Doman-Delacato treatment of patterning for developmental disabilities |journal= West J Med |year=1983 |pages=553–6 |volume=139 |issue=4 |pmid=6196919 |pmc=1021589}}</ref> In 1978, Sara Sparrow (professor emerita and senior research scientist at Yale Child Study Center)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://childstudycenter.yale.edu/faculty/sparrow.html |title=Sara S.

PMID 7258304</ref> According to Edward Zigler and Robert Hodapp, in their book ''Understanding Mental Retardation'', the Doman-Delacato method has major flaws:<ref name="zigler1986"/>

*The recapitulation theory it is built upon has been discarded by the natural sciences.
*The  suggestion that motor development has stages, which depend on earlier developments, is not supported by evidence.
*There is no evidence that passive movements by a child, forced to engage in crawling movements, affects neurological organization.
*Children who voluntarily perform an activity (such as sitting or walking) before mastering preceding stages, are prevented from doing so by the IAHP—possibly harming the child.
*The only scientific paper published by Doman on patterning (in 1960) contains many methodological errors and overstatements of findings. The study had no control group so was unable to compare with children who would naturally show some developmental progress over time. When independent scientists compared the results with the progress made by untreated children, the "results of patterning appear singularly unimpressive".
*The patterning procedure may be harmful to its participants (the parents experience guilt at being unable to achieve the intensive program required) and other family members through neglect.
*It is cruel to offer hope through a program that is impossible to fully carry out.

<blockquote>The Doman-Delacato patterning technique is premised on a bankrupt and discarded theory and has failed when tested under controlled conditions. Its promotion with unsubstantiated claims can cause significant financial and emotional damage. Such claims can instill false hope in many people who are already plagued by guilt and depression, setting them up for a further disappointment, guilt, and feelings of inadequacy. The process can also waste their time, energy, emotion, and money. These resources may be taken away from their children. Parents can also be distracted from dealing with the situation in other practical ways and coping psychologically as a family with the reality of having a brain-injured or mentally retarded child. Parents are encouraged, in fact, to remain in a state of denial while they are pursuing a false cure.<ref name=Novella/></blockquote>
