'''Low-level laser therapy''' ('''LLLT''') is a [[medicine|medical]] and [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary]] treatment that uses low-level [[laser]]s or [[light-emitting diode]]s to alter cellular function.  LLLT is controversial in mainstream medicine with ongoing research to determine whether there is a demonstrable effect.  Also disputed are the ideal location of treatment (specifically whether LLLT is more appropriately used over [[nerve]]s versus [[joint]]s<ref name = Brosseau/>), dose, wavelength, timing, pulsing and duration.<ref name = Huang>{{cite pmid | 20011653 }}</ref>  The effects of LLLT appear to be limited to a specified set of wavelengths of laser,<ref name = Bjordal2008/> and administering LLLT below the dose range does not appear to be effective.<ref name = Bjordal2003/>

Despite a lack of consensus over its ideal use, specific test and protocols for LLLT suggest it is effective in relieving short-term pain for [[rheumatoid arthritis]],<ref name = Brosseau>{{cite pmid | 16235295 }}</ref> osteoarthritis,<ref name = "PMID17986496" >{{cite pmid | 17986496 }}</ref> acute and chronic [[neck pain]],<ref name = Chow2010>{{cite pmid | 19913903 }}</ref> [[tendinopathy]],<ref name = Bjordal2008>{{cite pmid | 18510742 }}</ref><ref name = pmid19708800 >{{cite pmid | 19708800 }}</ref> and possibly chronic joint disorders.<ref name = Bjordal2003>{{cite pmid | 12775206 }}</ref>  The evidence for LLLT being useful in the treatment of [[low back pain]],<ref name = Cochrane2008>{{cite pmid | 18425909 }}</ref><ref name = Middelkoop>{{cite pmid | 20640863 }}</ref> dentistry<ref name = Cobb/><ref name = Sculean/> and [[wound healing]] is equivocal.<ref name = Silva2010>{{cite pmid | 19764898 }}</ref>

==History==
In 1967 a few years after the first working laser was invented, [[Endre Mester]] in [[Semmelweis University]] in Budapest, Hungary experimented with the effects of lasers on skin cancer.  While applying lasers to the backs of shaven [[mouse|mice]], he noticed that the shaved hair grew back more quickly on the treated group than the untreated group.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mester |first=E. |coauthors=Szende, B., and Tota, J.G. |year=1967 |title=Effect of laser on hair growth of mice |journal=Kiserl Orvostud |volume=19 |pages=628â€“631}}</ref>

==Clinical applications==
LLLT has primarily been shown useful in the short-term treatment of acute [[pain]] caused by [[rheumatoid arthritis]],<ref name = Brosseau/> osteoarthritis,<ref name = "PMID17986496"/> [[tendinopathy]],<ref name = Bjordal2008/><ref name = pmid19708800/> and possibly chronic joint disorders.<ref name = Bjordal2003/>  LLLT has also been useful in the treatment of both acute and chronic [[neck pain]].<ref name = Chow2010/>  A [[Cochrane Library]] review concluded that low level laser therapy (LLLT) has insufficient evidence for treatment of nonspecific [[low back pain]],<ref name = Cochrane2008/> a finding echoed in a later review of treatments for chronic low back pain.<ref name = Middelkoop/>  Though it has been suggested for decades that LLLT could be useful in speeding [[wound healing]], the appropriate parameters (dose, type of laser, materials, wavelength, etc.) have not been identified.<ref name = Silva2010/>  Similarly, the use of lasers to treat [[chronic periodontitis]]<ref name = Cobb>{{cite pmid | 16584335 }}</ref> and to speed healing of [[Peri-implantitis|infections around dental implants]]<ref name = Sculean>{{cite pmid | 16288590 }}</ref> is suggested, but there is insufficient evidence to indicate a use superior to traditional practices.<ref name = Karlsson>{{cite pmid | 18980508 }}</ref>

[[Stephen Barrett]], writing for [[Quackwatch]], concluded there was evidence to support LLLT use for temporary pain relief, but "there's no reason to believe that they will influence the course of any ailment or are more effective than other forms of heat delivery."<ref>{{cite web | last = Barrett | first = S | authorlink = Stephen Barrett | title = A Skeptical Look at Low Level Laser Therapy | url = http://www.devicewatch.org/reports/lllt.shtml | publisher = [[Quackwatch]] | accessdate = 2010-07-23 | date = 2009-07-17 }}</ref>

The insurance company, [[Cigna]], has reviewed the evidence for LLLT and concluded that it is still considered an experimental treatment.  Therefore, Cigna does not provide coverage for it.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cigna.com/customer_care/healthcare_professional/coverage_positions/medical/mm_0115_coveragepositioncriteria_lowlevel_laser_therapy.pdf | format = pdf | title = Cigna Medical Coverage Policy - Subject: Low Level Laser Therapy | date = 2010-07-15 | accessdate = 2010-08-06 | publisher = [[Cigna]]}}</ref>

==Mechanism==
It is unclear how LLLT works.  LLLT may reduce [[pain]] related to [[inflammation]] by lowering, in a [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose-dependent]] manner, levels of [[prostaglandin E2]], [[PTGS2|prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2]], [[IL1B|interleukin 1-beta]], [[tumor necrosis factor-alpha]], the cellular influx of [[neutrophil granulocyte]]s, [[oxidative stress]], [[edema]], and [[bleeding]].  The appropriate dose appears to be between 0.3 and 19 [[joule]]s per square centimetre.<ref>{{cite pmid | 16706694 }}</ref>  Another mechanism may be related to stimulation of [[mitochondrion]] to increase the production of [[adenosine triphosphate]] resulting in an increase in [[reactive oxygen species]], which influences [[redox]] signalling, affecting intracellular [[homeostasis]] or the proliferation of cells.<ref>{{cite pmid | 18665762 }}</ref>  The final enzyme in the production of ATP by the mitochondria, [[cytochrome c oxidase]], does appear to accept energy from laser-level lights, making it a possible candidate for mediating the properties of laser therapy.<ref>{{cite pmid | 18651871 }}</ref>

The effects of LLLT appear to be limited to a specified set of wavelengths of laser,<ref name = Bjordal2008/> and though more research is required to determine the ideal wavelengths, durations of treatment, dose and location of treatment (specifically whether LLLT is more appropriately used over [[nerve]]s versus [[joint]]s).<ref name = Brosseau/>  Administering LLLT below the dose range does not appear to be effective.<ref name = Bjordal2003/>  The factors of wavelength, effective dose, dose-rate effects, beam penetration, the role of [[coherence (physics)|coherence]], and pulses (peak power and repetition rates) are still poorly understood in the clinical setting. The typical laser average [[power (physics)|power]] is in the range of 1-500&nbsp;[[watt|mW]]; some high-peak-power, short-pulse-width devices are in the range of 1-100&nbsp;W with typical pulse-widths of 200&nbsp;ns. The typical average beam irradiance then is 10&nbsp;mW/cm<sup>2</sup> - 5&nbsp;W/cm<sup>2</sup>. The typical wavelength is in the range 600-1000&nbsp;nm (red to near [[infrared]]), but some research has been done and products outside of this range are available.<ref name="Huang"/>
