A '''pox party''', or '''flu party''' or '''flu fling''', is a social activity where children are deliberately exposed to a virus to promote immunity. Such parties are typically organized by parents on the premise of building the immune systems of their children against diseases such as chickenpox and [[measles]] (which can be more dangerous to adults than to children) or [[flu]]. Such practices are highly controversial and are discouraged by public health officials.<ref>

|quote=Chickenpox parties, at which children gather so they can all be infected by a child who has the pox, are often held by parents who distrust chickenpox vaccine or want their children to have the stronger immunity that surviving a full-blown infection affords and are willing to take the risk that their child will not get serious complications.

==Effectiveness and risk==
Parents who expose their children to the virus in this manner believe that this method is safer and more effective than receiving a vaccination.<ref name="nypost-10-09-2011">

Similar ideas have been applied to other diseases such as [[measles]]. However, pediatricians have warned against holding pox parties, citing dangers arising from possible complications associated with chicken pox, such as [[encephalitis]], chickenpox-associated [[pneumonia]], and invasive group A strep.<ref name="nypost-10-09-2011"/><ref name=Lollipops /> Although such complications are not common, they can cause brain damage or death. Before the chickenpox vaccine became available there were 100 to 150 deaths from chickenpox among children in the U.S. annually.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chickenpox lollipops?

Some parents have attempted to collect infected material, such as [[saliva]], licked [[lollipop]]s, or other infected items from people who claim to have children infected with chickenpox.<ref name=Lollipops />  The parents use [[social networking service]]s to make contact with these strangers.  The unknown person then mails the potentially infectious matter to the requester, who gives it or feeds it to his or her child in the hope that the child will become ill.<ref name=Lollipops /> <ref name="ReutersNov2011" />

Experts say it is unlikely that these methods will transmit the chickenpox virus effectively or reliably, because the varicella virus cannot survive for very long on the surface of such items.  However, it may be a reliable method of transmitting other diseases, including [[hepatitis B]], [[group A streptococcal infection]], and [[staphylococcal infection]]s—potentially deadly diseases that the parents never intended to expose their children to.<ref name=Lollipops />  Additionally, deliberately sending infectious matter through the [[U.S. Postal Service]] is illegal.<ref name=Lollipops>{{cite news

==History==
Historically, [[smallpox]] parties and other forms of controlled [[inoculation]] reduced significantly the death rate due to smallpox (see [[Inoculation|Variolation]]). With the introduction of a smallpox vaccine, inoculations of wild smallpox virus fell into disuse. 

Similarly, the [[rubella]] party was sometimes considered a [[rite of passage]] for pubescent females after the link between rubella infections early in pregnancy and severe birth defects was established, but before the development of effective rubella immunizations. 

In the United Kingdom and United States, pox parties were popular before the introduction of the [[varicella vaccine]] in  1989 in the UK, and 1995 in the US.<ref name=Lollipops />

==Flu parties==
During the [[2009 flu pandemic in Canada]], doctors noted an increase in what were termed ''flu parties'' or ''flu flings''. These gatherings, as with the pox parties, were designed explicitly to allow a parent's children to contract the "swine flu" influenza virus.<ref>{{cite news |first=CTV |last=News staff |title=Doctors say 'flu parties' not a good idea |url= http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20090702/flu_parties_090702/20090703/?hub=TorontoNewHome |publisher=CTV News| date=3 July 2009 |accessdate=3 July 2009}}</ref> Researchers such as Dr. Michael Gardam note that because the pandemic is caused by a [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|flu subtype]] that most people have had no exposure to, the parents are just as likely to get the disease and further the spread.  Although these events were heavily discussed in the media, very few were confirmed to have happened.<ref>[http://www.atlantamagazine.com/june2010/flustory.aspx "The Golden Boy and the Invisible Army"]</ref>
