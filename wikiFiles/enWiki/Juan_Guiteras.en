When the [[Spanish-American War]] broke out, Guiteras went to Cuba with the [[U.S. Army]] and joined the yellow fever research team led by [[William C. Gorgas]].<ref name=biog/>

Around this same time, [[Carlos Finlay]] and [[Walter Reed]] discovered that the [[Aedes]] mosquito was the [[disease vector]] for yellow fever.<ref name="pierce">Pierce J.R., J, Writer. 2005.

ISBN 0-471-47261-1</ref> Guiteras confirmed Finlay's results and collaborated with him to help eradicate Aedes from Cuba, reducing the incidence of yellow fever there. In 1900 he became chair of the Pathology and Tropical Diseases department at the [[University of Havana]] and founded the ''[[Journal of Tropical Medicine]]''. In 1902 he became director of the Cuban Department of Public Health and continued research in pathology.<ref name=biog/> He was a member of the Yellow Fever Commission of the [[International Health Board]] in 1916.<ref name=ajph/>
