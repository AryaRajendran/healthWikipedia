The '''buffy coat''' is the [[Blood fractionation|fraction]] of an [[anticoagulant|anticoagulated]] [[blood]] sample that contains most of the [[white blood cell]]s and [[platelet]]s following [[centrifugation|density gradient centrifugation]] of the blood. 
==Description==
After centrifugation, one can distinguish a layer of clear fluid (the [[blood plasma|plasma]]), a layer of red fluid containing most of the [[red blood cell]]s, and a thin layer in between. Making up less than 1% of the total volume of the blood sample, the buffy coat (so-called because it is usually [[buff (colour)|buff]] in hue), contains most of the white blood cells and [[platelet]]s. The buffy coat is used, for example, to extract [[DNA]] from the blood of [[mammal]]s (since mammalian red blood cells are [[cell nucleus|anucleate]] and do not contain DNA).

The buffy coat is usually whitish in color, but is sometimes green if the blood sample contains large amounts of [[neutrophil granulocyte|neutrophils]] (which are high in green [[myeloperoxidase]]). The layer next to buffy coat contains [[granulocytes]] and [[red blood cells]].

==Diagnostic uses of the buffy coat==
*'''Quantitative buffy coat''' (QBC) is a [[Medical laboratory|laboratory]] test to detect infection with [[malaria]] or other blood [[parasite]]s. The blood is taken in a QBC capillary tube which is coated with [[acridine orange]] (a fluorescent dye) and centrifuged;  the [[fluorescence|fluorescing]] parasites can then be observed under [[ultraviolet]] light at the interface between red blood cells and buffy coat. This test is more sensitive than the conventional [[thick smear]] and in > 90% of cases the species of parasite can also be identified.
*In cases of extremely low white blood cell count, it may be difficult to perform a manual differential of the various types of white cells, and it may be virtually impossible to obtain an automated differential. In such cases the [[medical technologist]] may obtain a buffy coat, from which a blood smear is made. This smear contains a much higher number of white blood cells than whole blood.
