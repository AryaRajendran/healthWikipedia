'''Malaria prophylaxis''' is a preventive treatment of [[malaria]]. 

Most adults from endemic areas have a degree of long-term infection, which tends to recur, and also possess partial [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] (resistance); the resistance reduces with time, and such adults may become susceptible to severe malaria if they have spent a significant amount of time in non-endemic areas. They are strongly recommended to take full precautions if they return to an endemic area.  Several [[malaria vaccine]]s are under development.

* Awareness of risk;
* Bite prevention - Travelers to malarious areas are advised to wear long clothes that cover as much of the skin as possible.  Exposed parts of the body should be treated with insect repellent.  When sleeping, insecticide-impregnated bed nets should be used. See also: [[Indoor residual spraying]]
* Chemoprophylaxis; and
* rapid diagnosis and treatment.

Recent improvements in malaria prevention strategies have further enhanced its effectiveness in combating areas highly infected with the malaria parasite.  Additional bite prevention measures include mosquito and insect repellents that can be directly applied to skin.  This form of mosquito repellent is slowly replacing [[indoor residual spraying]], which is considered to have high levels of toxicity by WHO (World Health Organization).  Further additions to preventive care are sanctions on blood transfusions.  Once the malaria parasite enters the erythorocytic stage, it can adversely affect blood cells, making it possible to contract the parasite through infected blood.

[[Chloroquine]] may be used where the parasite is still sensitive.<ref name="pmid19821371"/> However due to resistance one of three medications: [[mefloquine]] (''Lariam''), [[doxycycline]] (available generically), and the combination of [[atovaquone]] and [[proguanil]] hydrochloride (''Malarone'') is frequently needed.<ref name="pmid19821371"/> Doxycycline and the atovaquone and proguanil combination are the best tolerated with mefloquine associated with higher rates of neurological and psychiatric symptoms.<ref name="pmid19821371">{{Cite journal|author=Jacquerioz FA, Croft AM |title=Drugs for preventing malaria in travellers |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=4 |pages=CD006491 |year=2009 |pmid=19821371 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006491.pub2}}</ref>

==Medications==
In choosing the agent, it is important to weigh the risk of infection against the risks and side effects associated with the medications.<ref name="McMillanFeigin2006">{{cite book|author1=Julia A.

===Suppressive prophylaxis===
[[Chloroquine]], [[proguanil]], [[mefloquine]], and [[doxycycline]] are suppressive prophylactics.  This means that they are only effective at killing the malaria parasite once it has entered the erythrocytic stage (blood stage) of its life cycle, and therefore have no effect until the liver stage is complete.  That is why these prophylactics must continue to be taken for four weeks after leaving the area of risk.

===Causal prophylaxis===
Causal prophylactics target not only the blood stages of malaria, but the initial liver stage as well.  This means that the user can stop taking the drug seven days after leaving the area of risk.  [[Malarone]] and [[primaquine]] are the only causal prophylactics in current use.

===Regimens===

Specific regimens are recommended by the [[World Health Organisation|WHO]],<ref>The [http://www.who.int/ith/en/ World Health Organisation] provides country-specific advice on malaria prevention.</ref> [[Health Protection Agency|UK HPA]]<ref>2007 guidelines are available from the [http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/malaria/guidelines.htm UK Health Protection Agency] website as a PDF file and includes detailed country-specific information for UK travellers.</ref> and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]<ref>the [http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] website hosts constantly updated country-specific information on malaria.  The advice on this website is less detailed, is very cautious and may not be appropriate for all areas within a given country.  This is the preferred site for travellers from the US.</ref> for prevention of [[P. falciparum]] infection. HPA and WHO advice are broadly in line with each other (although there are some differences).  CDC guidance frequently contradicts HPA and WHO guidance.

These regiments include:
* [[doxycycline]] 100&nbsp;mg once daily (started one day before travel, and continued for four weeks after returning);
* [[mefloquine]] 228 to 250&nbsp;mg once weekly (started two-and-a-half weeks before travel, and continued for four weeks after returning);
* [[atovaquone]]/[[proguanil]] (Malarone) 1 tablet daily (started one day before travel, and continued for 1 week after returning).

In areas where chloroquine remains effective:
* [[chloroquine]] 300 to 310&nbsp;mg once weekly, and [[proguanil]] 200&nbsp;mg once daily (started one week before travel, and continued for four weeks after returning);

What regimen is appropriate depends on the person who is to take the medication as well as the country or region travelled to.  This information is available from the UK HPA, WHO or CDC (links are given below).  Doses depend also on what is available (e.g., in the US, mefloquine tablets contain 228&nbsp;mg base, but 250&nbsp;mg base in the UK). The data is constantly changing and no general advice is possible.

Doses given are appropriate for adults and children aged 12 and over.

Other chemoprophylactic regimens that have been used on occasion:
* [[Dapsone]] 100&nbsp;mg and [[pyrimethamine]] 12.5&nbsp;mg once weekly (available as a combination tablet called Maloprim or Deltaprim): this combination is not routinely recommended because of the risk of [[agranulocytosis]];
* [[Primaquine]] 30&nbsp;mg once daily (started the day before travel, and continuing for seven days after returning): this regimen is not routinely recommended because of the need for [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase|G-6-PD]] testing prior to starting primaquine (''see the article on'' [[primaquine]] for more information).
* [[Quinine]] sulfate 300 to 325&nbsp;mg once daily: this regimen is effective but not routinely used because of the unpleasant side effects of quinine.

Prophylaxis against [[Plasmodium vivax]] requires a different approach given the long liver stage of this parasite.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schwartz E, Parise M, Kozarsky P, Cetron M |title=Delayed onset of malaria--implications for chemoprophylaxis in travelers |journal=N.

==Vaccines==
In November 2012, findings from a Phase III trials of an experimental [[malaria vaccine]] known as [[RTS,S]] reported that it provided modest protection against both clinical and severe malaria in young infants. The RTS,S vaccine was engineered using genes from the outer protein of ''Plasmodium falciparum'' malaria parasite and a portion of a hepatitis B virus and a chemical adjuvant to boost the immune system response.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1056/NEJMoa1208394}}</ref> It is being developed by PATH and [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK), which has spent about $300 million on the project, plus about $200 million more from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]<ref>Stein, R.

==History==
Malaria is one of the oldest known pathogens, and began having a major impact on human survival about 10,000 years ago with the birth of agriculture. The development of virulence in the parasite has been demonstrated using genomic mapping of samples from this period, confirming the emergence of genes conferring a reduced risk of developing the malaria infection. References to the disease can be found in manuscripts from [[ancient Egypt]], [[History of India|India]] and [[ancient China|China]], illustrating its wide geographical distribution. The first treatment identified is thought to be [[Quinine]], one of four [[alkaloid]]s from the bark of the [[Cinchona]] tree. Originally it was used by the tribes of Ecuador and Peru for treating fevers. Its role in treating malaria was recognised and recorded first by an Augustine monk from [[Lima, Peru]] in 1633. Seven years later the drug had reached Europe and was being used widely with the name 'the Jesuit's bark'. From this point onwards the use of Quinine and the public interest in malaria increased, although the compound was not isolated and identified as the active ingredient until 1820. By the mid-1880s the Dutch had grown vast plantations of cinchona trees and monopolised the world market. 

Quinine remained the only available treatment for malaria until the early 1920s. During the [[First World War]] German scientists developed the first synthetic antimalarial compound – [[Atabrin]] and this was followed by [[Resochin]] and [[Sontochin]] derived from [[4-aminoquinoline]] compounds. American troops, on capturing Tunisia during the [[Second World War]], acquired, then altered the drugs to produce [[Chloroquine]].

The development of new [[antimalarial drug]]s spurred the [[World Health Organization]] in 1955 to attempt a [[global malaria eradication program]]. This was successful in much of Brazil, the US and Egypt but ultimately failed elsewhere. Efforts to control malaria are still continuing, with the development of drug-resistant parasites presenting increasingly difficult problems.
