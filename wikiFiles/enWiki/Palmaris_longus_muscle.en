The '''palmaris longus''' is seen as a small tendon between the [[flexor carpi radialis]] and the [[flexor carpi ulnaris]], although it is not always present. The muscle is absent in about 14 percent of the population, however this varies greatly with ethnicity. Absence of palmaris does not have any known effect on grip strength.<ref name=grip-strenght>{{Cite pmid|15935531}}</ref> However, lack of the palmaris longus muscle is disadvantageous in that its tendon can not be harvested as a graft if necessary.  

Palmaris longus can be palpated by touching the pads of the fifth and first fingers and flexing the wrist. The tendon, if present, will be very visible.

==Course==
It is a slender, fusiform muscle, lying on the medial side of the [[Flexor carpi radialis muscle|flexor carpi radialis]].<ref name="Gray's">''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'' (1918), see infobox</ref>

It arises from the [[Medial epicondyle of the humerus|medial epicondyle]] of the [[humerus]] by the [[common flexor tendon]], from the intermuscular septa between it and the adjacent muscles, and from the [[antebrachial fascia]].<ref name="Gray's" />

It ends in a slender, flattened tendon, which passes over the upper part of the [[Flexor retinaculum of the hand|flexor retinaculum]], and is inserted into the central part of the flexor retinaculum and lower part of the [[palmar aponeurosis]], frequently sending a tendinous slip to the short muscles of the [[thumb]].<ref name="Gray's" />

The palmaris longus tendon is responsible for exposing the claws in other mammals. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Variation==
The palmaris longus muscle is a variable muscle. The most common variation is its absence. Several in vivo and in vitro studies have documented the prevalence of absence of the PL tendon in different ethnic groups. The overall prevalence of the absence of the PL tendon in Caucasian populations (European and North American) has been reported between 5.5 and 24% . On the other hand, the overall prevalence of absence of the PL tendon in Asian populations (Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Turkish, Malaysian) has been reported between 4.6 and 26.6%.

There are also variations related to its form. It may be tendinous above and muscular below; or it may be muscular in the center with a tendon above and below; or it may present two muscular bundles with a central tendon; or finally it may consist solely of a tendinous band. The muscle may be double, or missing entirely. Slips of origin from the [[coronoid process of the ulna|coronoid process]] or from the radius have been seen. Partial or complete insertion into the fascia of the forearm, into the tendon of the [[flexor carpi ulnaris]] and [[pisiform bone]], into the [[scaphoid]], and into the muscles of the [[little finger]] have been observed.

==Use in tendon grafts==

The palmaris longus muscle is the most popular for use in tendon grafts for the wrist due to the length and diameter of the palmaris longus tendon, and the fact that it can be used without producing any functional deformities.<ref>{{Cite web

The tendons most commonly replaced or supplemented by the palmaris longus tendon when ruptured are the long flexors of the fingers and  the [[flexor pollicis longus]] tendon.<ref>{{Cite journal

The palmaris longus muscle itself is a weak flexor, and provides no substantial flexing force that would inhibit movement in the wrist if its tendon was cut and moved elsewhere. If the palmaris longus muscle is not available for harvesting in an individual, the anatomically analogous [[plantaris]] muscle in the leg may be taken instead.<ref>{{Cite web
