'''Peribronchial cuffing''', also referred to as '''peribronchial thickening''' or '''bronchial wall thickening''', is a [[radiologic sign]] which occurs when excess fluid or [[mucus]] buildup in the small airway passages of the [[lung]] causes localized patches of [[atelectasis]] (lung collapse).<ref name="PMID15983074">{{cite journal |author=Bramson RT, Griscom NT, Cleveland RH. |title=Interpretation of chest radiographs in infants with cough and fever. |journal=Radiology |volume=236 |issue=1 |pages=22â€“29 |year=2005 |pmid=15983074 |doi=10.1148/radiol.2361041278}}</ref> This causes the area around the bronchus to appear more prominent on an [[x-ray computed tomography|X-ray]]. It has also been described as donut sign, considering the edge is thicker, and the center contains air.

Peribronchial cuffing is seen in a number of conditions including: 
* [[acute bronchitis]]
* [[asthma]] following exercise or during an acute episode
* [[bronchopulmonary dysplasia]]
* [[congestive heart failure]]
* [[cystic fibrosis]]
* [[diffuse parenchymal lung disease]]
* Extreme exertion through physical exercise
* [[Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome]]
* [[human metapneumovirus]]
* [[Kawasaki disease]]
* [[Lung cancer]]
* [[Pneumonia]]
* [[pulmonary edema]]
* Smoke inhalation

==Treatment==
As peribronchial cuffing is a sign rather than a symptom or condition, there is no specific treatment except to treat the underlying cause.
