'''Ebstein anomaly''' is a [[congenital heart defect]] in which the septal leaflet of the [[tricuspid valve]] is displaced towards the apex of the [[right ventricle]] of the [[heart]].

==Presentation==
The annulus of the valve is still in the normal position. The valve leaflets, however, are to a varying degree, attached to the walls and septum of the right ventricle.  There is subsequent 'atrialization' of a portion of the morphologic right ventricle (which is then contiguous with the right atrium).  This causes the right atrium to be large and the anatomic right ventricle to be small in size.

* S3 heart sound
* S4 heart sound
* Systolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation
* Middiastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border
* Right atrial hypertrophy
* Right ventricular conduction defects
* [[Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome]] often accompanies

==Risk factors==
There is an enlargement of the aorta, which may cause an increased risk of abnormality in infants of women taking [[lithium pharmacology|lithium]] during the first trimester of pregnancy (though some have questioned this)<ref name="pmid18982835">{{cite journal |author=Yacobi S, Ornoy A |title=Is lithium a real teratogen?

==History==
Ebstein anomaly was named after [[Wilhelm Ebstein]],<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|435}}</ref><ref>W. Ebstein. Über einen sehr seltenen Fall von Insufficienz der Valvula tricuspidalis, bedingt durch eine angeborene hochgradige Missbildung derselben. Archiv für Anatomie, Physiologie und wissenschaftliche Medicin, Leipzig, 1866, 238-254.</ref> who in 1866 described the heart of the 19 year old Joseph Prescher. More recently it has also been named Kassamali's Anomaly.

==Related abnormalities==

While Ebstein anomaly is defined as the congenital displacement of the tricuspid valve towards the apex of the right venticle, it is often associated with other abnormalities.

===Anatomic abnormalities===
Typically, there are anatomic abnormalities of the tricuspid valve, with enlargement of the anterior leaflet of the valve. The other leaflets are described as being plastered to the endocardium.

About 50% of individuals with Ebstein anomaly have an associated shunt between the right and left atria, either an [[atrial septal defect]] or a [[patent foramen ovale]].

===Electrophysiologic abnormalities===
About 50% of individuals with Ebstein anomaly have evidence of [[Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome]], secondary to the atrialized right ventricular tissue.

[[Image:Ebstein's anomaly ECG.png|thumb|10-lead ECG of a woman with '''Ebstein anomaly'''. The ECG shows signs of right atrial enlargement, best seen in V1. Other P waves are broad and tall, these are termed "Himalayan" P waves. There is also a right bundle branch block pattern and a first degree atrioventricular block (prolonged PR-interval) due to intra-atrial conduction delay. There is no evidence of a Kent-bundle in this patient. There is T wave inversion in V1-4 and a marked Q wave in III; these changes are characteristic for Ebstein's anomaly and do not reflect ischemic ECG changes in this patient.]]
Other abnormalities that can be seen on the ECG include (1) signs of right atrial enlargement or tall and broad 'Himalayan' P waves, (2) [[first degree atrioventricular block]] manifesting as a prolonged PR-interval, (3) low amplitude QRS complexes in the right precordial leads, (4) atypical [[right bundle branch block]], (5) T wave inversion in V1-V4 and Q waves in V1-V4 and II, III and aVF.<ref name="pmid18056539">{{cite journal |author=Khairy P, Marelli AJ |title=Clinical use of electrocardiography in adults with congenital heart disease |journal=Circulation |volume=116 |issue=23 |pages=2734–46 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18056539 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.691568 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18056539}}</ref>

==Management==

===Pharmacological===
Ebstein's cardiophysiology typically presents as an (antidromic) [[AV reentrant tachycardia]] with associated [[pre-excitation]]. In this setting, the preferred pharmacological treatment agent is [[procainamide]]. Since AV-blockade may promote conduction over the accessory pathway, drugs like [[beta blockers]], [[calcium channel blocker]]s and [[digoxin]] are contraindicated.

If there is [[atrial fibrillation]] with pre-excitation, treatment options include [[procainamide]], [[flecainide]], [[propafenone]], [[dofetilide]] and [[ibutilide]] since these medications slow conduction in the accessory pathway causing the tachycardia and should be administered before considering electrical [[cardioversion]]. Intravenous [[amiodarone]] may also convert atrial fibrillation and/or slow the ventricular response.

===Surgical===
The [[Canadian Cardiovascular Society]] (CCS) recommends surgical intervention for the following indications:<ref name="CCS2009">{{Cite pmid|20352139|noedit}}</ref>
* Limited exercise capacity ([[New York Heart Association Functional Classification|NYHA III-IV]]).
* Increasing heart size (cardiothoracic ratio greater than 65%).
* Important [[cyanosis]] (resting [[oxygen saturation]] of less than 90%). (Level B)
* Severe [[tricuspid regurgitation]] with symptoms.
* [[Transient ischemic attack]] or [[stroke]]
The CCS further recommends patients who require operation for Ebstein anomaly should be operated on by congenital heart surgeons who have substantial specific experience and success with this operation. Every effort should be made to preserve the native tricuspid valve.<ref name="CCS2009" />
