The '''''stratum corneum''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for 'horned layer') is the outermost layer of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], consisting of dead [[cell (biology)|cell]]s (corneocytes) that lack [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] and [[organelle]]s.

The purpose of the ''stratum corneum'' is to form a barrier to protect underlying tissue from [[infection]], [[dehydration]], chemicals and mechanical stress. [[Desquamation]], the process of cell shedding from the surface of the ''stratum corneum'', balances proliferating [[keratinocyte]]s that form in the ''[[stratum basale]]''. These cells migrate through the epidermis towards the surface in a journey that takes approximately fourteen days.<ref name="ovaere">{{cite journal

==Function==
During cornification, the process whereby living keratinocytes are transformed into non-living corneocytes, the [[cell membrane]] is replaced by a layer of [[ceramide]]s which become covalently linked to an envelope of structural proteins (the cornified envelope).<ref name="ovaere" /><ref name="haftek">

This complex surrounds cells in the ''stratum corneum'' and contributes to the skin's barrier function. Corneodesmosomes (modified [[desmosome]]s) facilitate cellular adhesion by linking adjacent cells within this epidermal layer. These complexes are degraded by [[proteases]], eventually permitting cells to be shed at the surface. Desquamation and formation of the cornified envelope are both required for the maintenance of skin homeostasis. A failure to correctly regulate these processes leads to the development of skin disorders.<ref name="ovaere"/>

Cells of the ''stratum corneum'' contain a dense network of [[keratin]], a [[protein]] that helps keep the skin hydrated by preventing [[water]] [[evaporation]]. These cells can also [[absorption (chemistry)|absorb]] water, further aiding in hydration. In addition, this layer is responsible for the "spring back" or stretchy properties of skin. A weak glutenous protein bond pulls the skin back to its natural shape.

The thickness of the ''stratum corneum'' varies throughout the body. In the palms of the [[hand]]s and the [[Sole (foot)|sole]]s of the feet this layer is typically thicker, since these regions require additional protection in order to grasp objects and avoid injury. In general, the ''stratum corneum'' contains 15 to 20 layers of dead cells. The stratum corneum has a thickness between 10 and 40 μm.

In [[reptile]]s, the ''stratum corneum'' is permanent, and is replaced only during times of rapid growth, in a process called [[ecdysis]] or [[moulting]]. This is conferred by the presence of [[beta-keratin]], which provides a much more rigid skin layer.

In the human forearm, about 1300 cells per cm<sup>2</sup> per hour are shed. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

== Skin disease ==
An inability to correctly maintain the skin barrier function due to the dysregulation of epidermal components can lead to skin disorders. For example, a failure to modulate the activity of [[kallikrein#Tissue kallikreins|kallikreins]] via the disruption of the [[protease inhibitor (biology)|protease inhibitor]] [[LEKTI]] causes the debilitating disorder [[Netherton syndrome]].<ref name="pmid15619623">{{cite journal | author = Descargues P, Deraison C, Bonnart C, Kreft M, Kishibe M, Ishida-Yamamoto A, Elias P, Barrandon Y, Zambruno G, Sonnenberg A, Hovnanian A. | title = Spink5-deficient mice mimic Netherton syndrome through degradation of desmoglein 1 by epidermal protease hyperactivity | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–65 | year = 2005 | month = Jan | pmid = 15619623  | pmc =  | doi =  10.1038/ng1493}}</ref>
