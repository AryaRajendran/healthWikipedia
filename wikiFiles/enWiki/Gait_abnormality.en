'''Gait abnormality''' is a deviation from normal walking ([[gait (human)|gait]]). Watching a patient walk is the most important part of the neurological examination. Normal gait requires that many systems, including strength, sensation and coordination, function in an integrated fashion. Many common problems in the [[nervous system]] and [[musculoskeletal system]] will show up in the way a person walks.<ref>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th ed., Ch. 346, Approach to the Paitent with Neurological Disease</ref>

==Presentation and causes==
Persons suffering from [[peripheral neuropathy]] experience [[numbness and tingling]] in their hands and feet.  This can cause ambulation impairment, such as trouble climbing stairs or maintaining [[Balance (ability)|balance]]. Gait abnormality is also common in persons with nervous system affections such as [[Multiple sclerosis]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Myasthenia gravis]], and [[Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease]]. [[Orthopedic]] corrective treatments may also manifest into gait abnormality, such as lower extremity [[amputation]], post-[[fracture]], and [[arthroplasty]] ([[joint replacement]]). Difficulty in ambulation that results from [[chemotherapy]] is generally temporary in nature, though recovery times of six months to a year are common. Likewise, difficulty in walking due to [[arthritis]] or joint pains (antalgic gait) sometimes resolves spontaneously once the pain is gone.<ref>[http://www.selmanholman.com/SHAweb_tools.htm Gait Abnormality Coding Checklist by Jun Mapili, PT, MAEd]</ref><ref>[http://icd9cm.chrisendres.com/index.php?action=child&recordid=7657 ICD-9-cm Chrisenders]</ref>
