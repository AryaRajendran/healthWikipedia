A '''resuscitative thoracotomy''' (sometimes referred to as an '''emergency department thoracotomy''') is a [[thoracotomy]] typically done in order to [[resuscitate]] a person who has been severely injured after sustaining a severe [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] involving the [[thoracic cavity]].<ref>{{cite video | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naUT46aLIDM | title=Resuscitative Thoracotomy | publisher=The Division of Trauma/Surgical Critical Care/Burns is part of the Department of Surgery, UC San Diego Health System | people=November 27, 2012 | location=San Diego}}</ref> For most persons with [[thoracic trauma]] the procedure is not necessary; only 15% of those with thoracic injury require the procedure.<ref name="p462">Moore 2012, p.462</ref>

==Indications==
A resuscitative thoracotomy is indicated when severe injuries within the thoracic cavity prevent the physiologic functions needed to sustain life (such as [[hemorrhage]]). The injury may also affect a specific organ such as the heart which can develop an [[air embolism]] or a [[cardiac tamponade]] (which prevents the heart from beating properly). Other indications for the use of this procedure would be the appearance of blood from a [[thoracostomy]] tube placed that returns more than 1500 mL of blood, or ≥200 mL of blood per hour. 

For resuscitative thoracotomy to be indicated, signs of life must also be present including [[cardiac electrical activity]] and a [[systolic blood pressure]] >70 mm Hg.<ref name="p462"/><ref name="biffl">{{cite journal | title=Resuscitative thoracotomy | author=Biffl, L. Walter | journal=Operative Techniques in General Surgery | year=2000 | month=September | volume=2 | issue=3 | pages=168–175 | doi=10.1053/otgn.2000.17741}}</ref> In [[blunt trauma]], if signs of life, such as eye dilatation, are found en route to the hospital by first responders, but not found when the patient arrives, then further resuscitative interventions are contraindicated; however; when first responders find signs of life and [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] time is under 15 minutes, the procedure is indicated.<ref>Peitzman 2002, p. 227</ref> 

The use of a [[focused assessment with sonography for trauma]] may be performed to determine the need of the procedure by finding free floating fluid in the thoracic cavity.<ref name="Seamon">{{cite journal |author=Seamon MJ, Chovanes J, Fox N, ''et al.'' |title=The use of emergency department thoracotomy for traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest |journal=[[Injury]] |volume=43 |issue=9 |pages=1355–61 |year=2012 |month=September |pmid=22560130 |doi=10.1016/j.injury.2012.04.011 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020-1383(12)00139-8 |accessdate=2013-01-01}}</ref>

==Technique==
A left anterolateral thoracotomy is the common method of opening the chest as it provides rapid access, can be easily extended into the right hemithorax, and provides access to most of the important anatomical structures during resuscitation including the [[aorta]].<ref name="hunt"/> First an incision is made along the fourth or fifth [[intercostal space]] (between the ribs), intercostal muscles and the parietal [[pleura]] are divided, and then the ribs are retracted to provide visualization.<ref name="biffl"/> When the incision covers both the right and left hemothroaxes it is referred to as a "clamshell" thoracotomy. The clamshell thoracotomy is used when there is a right side [[pulmonary]] or [[vascular]] injury.<ref name="p242">Moore 2012, p. 242</ref>

==Recovery==
Usually those who undergo resuscitative thoracotomy do not recover—only 10% of those receiving it after sustaining a blunt injury and 15–30% of those with penetrating trauma survive.<ref name="hunt">{{cite journal |author=Hunt PA, Greaves I, Owens WA |title=Emergency thoracotomy in thoracic trauma-a review |journal=[[Injury]] |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=1–19 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16410079 |doi=10.1016/j.injury.2005.02.014 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020-1383(05)00053-7 |accessdate=2013-01-01}}</ref><ref>American College of Surgeons 2008, p. 92</ref><ref>Moore 2012, p. 240</ref>

==History==
The procedure was first utilized during the late 1800s by Schiff in conjunction with open cardiac massage. Shortly after it was also used by Block to treat heart [[lacerations]], and the first suture repair preformed in 1900.<ref name="trauma.org">{{cite web | url=http://www.trauma.org/archive/thoracic/EDTintro.html | title=Emergency Department Thoracotomy | publisher=Trauma.org | date=6, June 2001 | accessdate=January 01, 2013 | author=Brohi, Karim}}</ref> Before external [[defibrillation]] and [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] came in the 1960s, emergency thoracotomy was the preferred way to treat cardiac arrest.<ref>Moore 2012, p. 236</ref>
