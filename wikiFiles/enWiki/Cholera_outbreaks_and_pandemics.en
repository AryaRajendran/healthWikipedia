Although much is known about the mechanisms behind the spread of [[cholera]], this has not led to a full understanding of what makes cholera outbreaks happen some places and not others. Lack of treatment of human [[feces]] and lack of treatment of drinking water greatly facilitate its spread. Bodies of water have been found to serve as a [[Natural reservoir|reservoir]], and seafood shipped long distances can spread the disease. Cholera did not occur in [[the Americas]] for most of the 20th century after the early 1900s in New York City. It reappeared in the Caribbean toward the end of that century and seems likely to persist.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Blake|first1=PA|title=Epidemiology of cholera in the Americas.|journal=Gastroenterology clinics of North America|volume=22|issue=3|pages= 639–60|year=1993|pmid=7691740}}</ref>

Deaths in [[Indian subcontinent|India]] between 1817 and 1860, in the first three pandemics of the nineteenth century, are estimated to have exceeded 15 million people. Another 23 million died between 1865 and 1917, during the next three pandemics.

==Pandemics==

===First===
* 1816–1826: The '''[[first cholera pandemic]]''', though previously restricted, began in [[Bengal]], and then spread across [[India]] by 1820. Hundreds of thousands of Indians and ten thousand [[British troops]] died during this pandemic.<ref>{{cite web |author=Pike J | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/intro/bio_cholera.htm |title=Cholera- Biological Weapons |work=Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) |publisher=GlobalSecurity.com |date=2007-10-23 |accessdate=2010-02-01}}</ref> The cholera outbreak extended as far as [[China]], [[Indonesia]] (where more than 100,000 people succumbed on the island of [[Java]] alone) and the [[Caspian Sea]] in Europe, before receding.

===Second===
* 1829–1851: A '''[[second cholera pandemic]]''' reached Russia (see [[Cholera Riots]]), [[Hungary]] (about 100,000 deaths) and [[Germany]] in 1831; it killed 150,000 people in [[Egypt]] that year.<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/bulletin/1947-1948/Vol1-No2/bulletin_1948_1(2)_353-381.pdf Cholera Epidemic in Egypt (1947)].</ref>  In 1832 it reached [[London]] and the United Kingdom (where more than 55,000 people died)<ref>[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/EPI/snow/pandemic1826-37.html Asiatic Cholera Pandemic of 1826-37]</ref> and [[Paris]].

In 1849, a second major outbreak occurred in Paris. In London, it was the worst outbreak in the city's history, claiming 14,137 lives, over twice as many as the 1832 outbreak. Cholera hit [[Ireland]] in 1849 and killed many of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] survivors, already weakened by starvation and fever.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20091027105918/http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Congress/2807/irishfamine.html The Irish Famine].</ref>{{Needs better source}} In 1849, cholera claimed 5,308 lives in the major port city of [[Liverpool]], [[England]], an embarkation point for immigrants to North America, and 1,834 in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], England.<ref name="Rosenberg" /> 

An outbreak in North America took the life of former [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[James K. Polk]].

In 1851, a ship coming from Cuba carried the disease to [[Gran Canaria]]. It is considered that more than 6,000 people died in the island during summer, out of a population of 80,000.

During this pandemic, the scientific community varied in its beliefs about the causes of cholera. In France doctors believed cholera was associated with the poverty of certain communities or poor environment. Russians believed the disease was contagious, although doctors did not understand how it spread. The United States believed that cholera was brought by recent immigrants, specifically the Irish, and epidemiologists understand they were carrying disease from British ports. Lastly, some British thought the disease might rise from divine intervention.<ref name="Hayes 2005 214–219">{{cite book|last=Hayes|first=J.N.|title=Epidemics and Pandemics: Their Impacts on Human History|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=214–219}}</ref>

===Third===
* 1852–1860: The '''[[third cholera pandemic]]''' mainly affected Russia, with over one million deaths. In 1852, cholera spread east to Indonesia, and later was carried to [[China]] and Japan in 1854. The [[Philippines]] were infected in 1858 and [[Korea]] in 1859. In 1859, an outbreak in Bengal contributed to transmission of the disease by travelers and troops to [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Arabia]] and Russia.<ref name="Pandemic" /> Japan suffered at least seven major outbreaks of cholera between 1858 and 1902. The [[Ansei]] outbreak of 1858-60, for example, is believed to have killed between 100,000 and 200,000 people in [[Tokyo]] alone.<ref>''[http://books.google.cz/books?id=2Ps-IesBlzkC&pg=PA313&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Kaoru Sugihara, Peter Robb, Haruka Yanagisawa, ''Local Agrarian Societies in Colonial India: Japanese Pperspectives''], (1996), p. 313.</ref>

They blamed their sanitation practices. Some United States scientists began to believe that cholera was somehow associated with African Americans, as the disease was prevalent in the South in areas of black populations. Current researchers note their populations were underserved in terms of sanitation infrastructure, and health care, and they lived near the waterways by which travelers and ships carried the disease.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hayes|first=J.N.|title=Epidemics and Pandemics: Their Impacts on Human History|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=233}}</ref>

: In London,{{when|date=April 2013}} a localized epidemic in the East End claimed 5,596 lives, just as the the city was completing construction of its major sewage and water treatment systems (see [[London sewerage system]]); the East End section was not quite complete. [[William Farr]], using the work of John Snow, ''et al.'', as to contaminated drinking water being the likely source of the disease, relatively quickly identified the East London Water Company as the source of the contaminated water. Quick action prevented further deaths.<ref name="Rosenberg" /> Also, a minor outbreak occurred at [[Ystalyfera]] in South Wales, caused by the local water works using contaminated canal water. Workers associated with the company and their families were most affected, and 119 died. In the same year, more than 21,000 people died in [[Amsterdam, The Netherlands]]. In the 1870s, cholera spread in the U.S. as an epidemic from New Orleans along the Mississippi River and to ports on its tributaries; thousands of people died.

===Fifth===

This was the last serious European cholera outbreak, as cities improved their sanitation and water systems.

===Sixth===
* 1899–1923: The '''[[sixth cholera pandemic]]''' had little effect in western Europe because of advances in public health, but major Russian cities and the [[Ottoman Empire]] were particularly hard hit by cholera deaths.

From [[North Africa]], it spread into Italy by 1973. In the late 1970s, there were small outbreaks in Japan and in the South Pacific. There were also many reports of a cholera outbreak near [[Baku]] in 1972, but information about it was suppressed in the [[USSR]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} In 1970, a cholera outbreak struck [[Sağmalcılar]] district of Istanbul, then an impoverished slum, claiming more than 50 lives; eventually the incident led to the renaming of the district as present-day [[Bayrampaşa]] by the authorities who were harshly criticized.

The causative agent was an O1, El Tor strain, with small differences from the seventh pandemic strain. In 1992 a new strain appeared in Asia, a non-O1, nonagglutinable vibrio (NAG), which was named O139 Bengal. It was first identified in [[Tamil Nadu]], India and for a while displaced El Tor in southern Asia. It decreased in prevalence from 1995 to around 10% of all cases. It is considered to be an intermediate between El Tor and the classic strain, and occurs in a new serogroup. Scientists warn of evidence of wide-spectrum resistance by cholera bacteria to drugs such as [[trimethoprim]], [[sulfamethoxazole]] and [[streptomycin]].

* A persistent strain of Gulf Coast cholera, 01, has been found in the brackish waters of marshes in [[Louisiana]] and [[Texas]] in the United States, leading to a situation of possible transmission by shipments of seafood from those areas to other parts of the country. Medical personnel were advised to think of cholera when assessing symptoms for people who had not been traveling. There have been occurrences in the South but no major outbreaks because of good sanitation and warning systems. It was noted there were more cases in two years from the Latin American epidemic, the El Tor strain, than in 20 years from the Gulf Coast strain.<ref>{{cite journal|author= P.A.

==Notable outbreaks (2010–present)==
* August 2010: Cholera in [[Nigeria]] was reaching epidemic proportions after widespread confirmation of the disease outbreaks in 12 of its 36 states. 6400 cases have been reported with 352 reported deaths. The health ministry blamed the outbreak on heavy seasonal rainfall and poor sanitation.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38852637/ns/health/ Cholera epidemic death toll rises to 352], MSNBC, 25 August 2010.</ref>

* October 2010 - January 2012, [[Haiti]] and [[Dominican Republic]]: Late in October 2010, a [[2010 Haitian cholera outbreak|cholera outbreak]] was reported in [[Haiti]].<ref>{{cite news| title=Haiti’s Latest Misery|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/opinion/27wed2.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 October 2010|accessdate=26 February 2011}}</ref> As of November 16, the Haitian Health Ministry reported the number of dead to be 1,034, with hospitalizations for cholera symptoms totaling over 16,700.<ref name="msnbc_16nov">{{cite news|title=Official: Cholera death toll in Haiti has passed 1,000|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40216940/|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[msnbc.com]]|date=16 November 2010|accessdate=26 February 2011}}</ref> The outbreak was blamed on a camp of Nepalese United Nations peacekeepers, but this was disputed. Scientists have found that Vibrio cholera bacteria can survive between outbreaks in brackish warm water, and it exists in Haitian waterways. The outbreak started on the upper [[Artibonite River]].;<ref name="Parker"/> people first contracted the disease from this river.<ref>[http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/haiti/UN-cholera-report-final.pdf WHO, "Final Report of the Independent Panel of Experts on the Cholera Outbreak in Haiti"]</ref> In addition, scientists think the hurricane and weather conditions in Haiti worsened the consequences of the outbreak, and damaged sanitation systems allowed it to spread.<ref name="Parker">[http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2010/world/hold-cholera-in-haiti-the-climate-connection Aubrey Ann Parker, "Cholera in Haiti: the Climate Connection"], Circle of Blue, 2010</ref> In the USA, a Florida woman who had recently moved from Haiti had cholera but was effectively treated.

* In January 2011, about 411 [[Venezuela]]n citizens attended a wedding in the Dominican Republic, where they ate ceviche (raw fish cooked in lemon juice) at the celebration. By the time they returned to Caracas and other Venezuelan cities, some of these travelers were suffering from symptoms of cholera. By January 28, almost 111 cases had been confirmed by the Venezuelan Health Authorities, who quickly set up an 800 number for people to call who wondered whether they were infected. Internationally, Colombia secured its eastern border against immigrants and probable transmission of the disease. Dominican officials started a nationwide study to determine the cause of the outbreak, and warned residents of the imminent danger associated with the consumption of raw fish and shellfish. As of January 29, 2011, none of the cases in Venezuela proved fatal, but two patients were hospitalized. Since the victims had quickly sought help, the outbreak was detected and contained.<ref>[http://www.wral.com/lifestyles/healthteam/story/9020742/ ], WRAL</ref>

* 2011: [[Nigeria]] and [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] have had outbreaks; the latter has suffered years of disruption from warfare. [[Somalia]] has suffered a double hit of cholera and [[2011 Horn of Africa famine|famine]], associated with the refugee camps, limited sanitation, and severe drought causing famine and lowered resistance.<ref>[http://www.bendbulletin.com/article/20110813/NEWS0107/108130383/ Jeffrey Gettleman / New York Times News Service, "U.N.: Cholera scourge now ravaging Somalia"], ''Bend Bulletin,'' 13 August 2011</ref>

* Cholera has returned to southern [[India]] in 2012, once thought to be eradicated, in relatively affluent [[Kerala]], ironically, due to efforts to improve sanitation, toilets were constructed.  While these toilets were under construction, workers defecated and contaminated community wells, causing the outbreak.<ref>http://dailypioneer.com/nation/99107-cholera-makes-a-comeback-in-kerala.html</ref>

* Cholera outbreak in 2011 and 2012 in multiple African nations, in all regions except North Africa, among them [[Ghana]] has led to intense campaign for handwashing.<ref>http://allafrica.com/stories/201210081462.html</ref>  In [[Sierra Leone]], some 21,500 cases with 290 deaths have been reported in 2012.<ref>http://vaccinenewsdaily.com/africa/320429-cholera-outbreak-in-sierra-leone-slows/</ref>

* Since 2010, fatal cholera outbreaks, not just travelers, have been reported in Haiti, Dominican Republic, Cuba, Venezuela, Iraq, Nepal, Pakistan, Iran, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Afghanistan, India, China, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Kenya, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Angola, Somalia, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, DRC, Congo, Mozambique, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Ukraine, and Niger.

== False reports ==
{{Main|Chicago 1885 cholera epidemic myth}}
A persistent urban myth states 90,000 people died in Chicago of cholera and [[typhoid fever]] in 1885, but this story has no factual basis.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/041112.html| title=Did 90,000 people die of typhoid fever and cholera in Chicago in 1885?| publisher=The Straight Dope| date=2004-11-12| accessdate=2010-02-01}}</ref> In 1885, a torrential rainstorm flushed the [[Chicago River]] and its attendant pollutants into [[Lake Michigan]] far enough that the city's water supply was contaminated. But, as cholera was not present in the city, there were no cholera-related deaths. As a result of the pollution, the city made changes to improve its treatment of sewage and avoid similar events.
