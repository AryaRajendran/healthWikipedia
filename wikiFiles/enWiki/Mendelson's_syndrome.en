'''Mendelson's syndrome''' is [[chemical pneumonitis]] caused by [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]] during [[anaesthesia]], especially during [[pregnancy]]. Aspiration contents may include gastric juice, blood, bile, water or an association of them.<ref>Г.А.Рябов, СИНДРОМЫ КРИТИЧЕСКИХ СОСТОЯНИЙ. Аспирационный пневмонит (синдром Мендельсона),  http://surgerycom.net/critical/4/4_3.html</ref>

==Presentation==
Mendelson's syndrome is characterised by a [[bronchopulmonary]] reaction following aspiration of gastric contents during general anaesthesia due to abolition of the [[laryngeal]] reflexes. The main clinical features are signs of general [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], two to five hours after anaesthesia. Such features may include cyanosis, dyspnoea, fever, pulmonary wheeze, crepitant rales, rhonchi, and tachycardia with a low blood pressure. Decreased [[arterial oxygen tension]] is also likely to be evident. [[Pulmonary edema]] can cause sudden death or death may occur later from pulmonary complications.

==Risk==
Historically it is said that a patient is at risk if they have:<ref name=Levy2006>{{cite journal|last=Levy|first=DM|title=Pre-operative fasting—60 years on from Mendelson|journal=Continuing Education in Anaesthesia, Critical Care & Pain|volume=6|issue=6|pages=215|year=2006|pmid=|pmc=|doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkl048|url=http://ceaccp.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/6/215.short}}</ref>
* Residual gastric volume of greater than 25ml, with
* [[pH]] of less than 2.5
However these are indirect measurements and are not factors that directly influence aspiration risk.<ref name=Levy2006/>

Patients with a high risk should have a [[rapid sequence induction]]. High risk is defined as these factors:<ref name=Levy2006/>
# Non-elective surgical procedure
# Light anaesthesia/unexpected response to stimulation
# Acute or chronic, upper or lower GI pathology
# [[Obesity]]
# [[Opioid]] medication
# Neurological disease, impaired conscious level, or sedation
# [[Lithotomy position]]
# Difficult intubation/airway
# Gastrointestinal reflux
# [[Hiatal hernia]]

==Treatment==
The risk may be reduced by administering a non-particulate [[antacid]] (e.g. Sodium Citrate) or an [[H2 antagonist|H<sub>2</sub>-antagonist]] like [[Ranitidine]].

==Eponym==
It is named for [[Curtis Mendelson]].<ref name=whonamedit>{{cite web|last=Enersen|first=OD|title=Whonamedit - Mendelson's syndrome|work=Whonamedit?
