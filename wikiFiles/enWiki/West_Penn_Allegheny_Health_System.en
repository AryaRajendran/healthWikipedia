'''West Penn Allegheny Health System''' ('''WPAHS''') is an academic medical center located in the [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area]]. The second-largest provider of healthcare in its region, WPAHS was formed by the merger of the [[Western Pennsylvania Hospital]] (West Penn), founded in 1848 as Pittsburgh's first chartered public hospital, and [[Allegheny General Hospital]] (AGH), which was founded in 1886. WPAHS is made up of these two tertiary hospitals, both located in [[Pittsburgh]], as well as three community hospitals:  Alle-Kiski Medical Center in [[Harrison Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Harrison Township]], [[Canonsburg General Hospital]] in [[Canonsburg, Pennsylvania|Canonsburg]],  and The Western Pennsylvania Hospital – Forbes Regional Campus in [[Monroeville, Pennsylvania|Monroeville]]. The system also includes Forbes Hospice, now located in West Penn Hospital, which opened in 1979 as Pittsburgh’s first end-of-life and palliative care program,<ref>http://www.wpahs.org/hospice/index.html</ref> and West Penn Allegheny Health System’s STAR Center (Simulation, Training and Academic Research Center), which provides simulation training for medical, nursing, and other health care professionals.<ref>http://www.wpahs.org/star/index.html</ref>

WPAHS employs approximately 13,000 people with a medical staff of 2,726. The system offers 46 graduate medical programs, operates two nursing schools, and serves as a clinical campus for the medical schools of [[Drexel University]] and [[Temple University]], which are located in [[Philadelphia]].<ref name="wpahs.org">http://www.wpahs.org/about/index.html</ref> WPAHS is also home to the Allegheny-Singer Research Institute, which sponsors interdisciplinary programs to understand, treat, and prevent human diseases. WPAHS's specialty programs have received national and international recognition, particularly those based in its Bone and Joint, Cardiovascular, Neurosciences, and Oncology institutes.

==History==
West Penn Allegheny Health System was formed from two of Pittsburgh's major historical hospitals: the Western Pennsylvania Hospital and Allegheny General Hospital. The Western Pennsylvania Hospital (West Penn), founded in 1848 and originally located in Pittsburgh's [[Strip District]] neighborhood moved to its current location in [[Bloomfield (Pittsburgh)|Bloomfield]] in 1912.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A27576 | first=Chris | last=Potter | date=2004-12-09 | title=My father once told me that West Penn Hospital got its start in the Strip District. Is that true? | newspaper=Pittsburgh City Paper | accessdate=2010-06-25}}</ref> Allegheny General Hospital (AGH) was founded in 1886 in Pittsburgh's [[North Side (Pittsburgh)|North Side]], then the separate municipality of [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania|Allegheny City]]. In 1930 construction began on one of the nation's first "skyscraper" hospitals, a 22-story high rise which is now designated a [[Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation]] historic landmark.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/aherf/timeline.asp | title=Anatomy of a Bankruptcy: Lifeline for an institution | newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | date=1999-01-17 | accessdate=2010-06-25}}</ref>

==AHERF==
Allegheny Health, Education and Research Foundation (AHERF) was established in 1983 as a nonprofit corporation to oversee the Allegheny General Hospital organization's affairs. In 1986 Sherif Abdelhak was hired as CEO and instituted a plan to create a statewide integrated health care delivery system. To accomplish this, and in reaction to its rivalry with local medical center competitor [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] (UPMC), AHERF undertook an aggressive acquisition of physician practices and hospitals across the state of Pennsylvania. By the mid-1990s, AHERF had acquired two medical schools (the Medical College of Pennsylvania and Hahnemann Medical College) and five hospitals located in the Philadelphia area, as well as additional hospitals in the Pittsburgh area. However, by 1997 financial problems started to appear and AHERF initiated hospital closures to divest itself of its operations in the eastern portion of the state. In July 1998 AHERF declared bankruptcy, the largest nonprofit health care failure in U.S. history. As a result, [[Drexel University]] took over the medical school operated by AHERF. In order to avoid bankruptcy, Allegheny General Hospital and some of AHERF's other hospitals in western Pennsylvania were sold to Pittsburgh's West Penn Health System in 1999, thus forming the current West Penn Allegheny Health System.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1377/hlthaff.19.1.7 | url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/reprint/19/1/7.pdf | first=Lawton R. | last=Burns | first2=John | last2=Cacciamani | first3=James | last3=Clement | first4=Welman | last4=Aquino | pages=7–41 | title=The Fall of the House of AHERF: The Allegheny Bankruptcy | journal=Health Affairs | volume=19 | issue=1 |date=January/February 2000 | accessdate=2010-06-25 | pmid=10645071}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/aherf/default.asp | title=Anatomy of a Bankruptcy | newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | year=1999 | format=6 part series | accessdate=2010-06-25}}</ref>

==Regional competition==
WPAHS competes against much larger health care organizations including UPMC. In April 2009 WPAHS filed an [[Competition law|antitrust]] lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh against UPMC and [[Highmark|Highmark Inc.]], the region’s largest insurer. The suit claimed that UPMC and Highmark had conspired to create a monopoly. WPAHS stated that UPMC had refused to contract with smaller health insurance companies at reasonable rates and in exchange, Highmark had agreed to pay UPMC at inflated rates.<ref>{{cite web |title=West Penn Allegheny Health System Inc.

==Financials==
In 2007 the hospital group issued more than $750 million in [[high-yield debt]], the largest [[junk bond]] offering by a nonprofit health care concern.  In 2008 the system had an operating loss of $89 million and a net loss of $57.8 million.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/30/business/30gret.html |work=New York Times |title=Fresh Air in the Muni Market |author=Gretchen Morgenson |date=August 29, 2009}}</ref> That same year, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] began an investigation of West Penn for "potentially erroneous evaluation and management claims" after the health system found $73 million in overstated accounts receivables.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09066/953781-28.stm | title=Hospital facing 2 U.S. probes | date=2009-03-07 | first=Steve | last=Twedt | newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref>  For fiscal year 2009, the health system posted a net loss of $25.2 million compared with a $57.8 million loss in fiscal 2008, when they were forced to make a $73 million writedown.

On June 29, 2010, WPAHS announced major consolidation plans to eliminate 1,500 positions and 300 beds. The plans would also close the emergency department, oncology, neuroscience, critical care, orthopedic, and cardiovascular services at West Penn Hospital in order to consolidate services at what would become the sole facility – Allegheny General Hospital.<ref name="consolidation2010">{{cite news | url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/pittsburgh/s_688118.html | title=West Penn Hospital to lay off 1,500 in Bloomfield | newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review | date=2010-06-30 | accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref> Plans were finalized in October 2010.

However, WAPHS lost $56 million in the last half of 2011, had $740 million in outstanding bonds, had a pension fund underfunded by $20 million,<ref name="bonds">{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/business/municipal-bonds-are-sometimes-still-lost-in-the-fog.html?_r=2 | title=A Fog Warning, Again, for Municipal Bonds | first=Gretchen | last=Morgenson | newspaper=The New York Times | location=New York, NY | date=2012-02-18 | accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref> and had its bond rating reduced by [[Moody's]] to Caa1 with a negative outlook.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.moodys.com/research/MOODYS-DOWNGRADES-WEST-PENN-ALLEGHENY-HEALTH-SYSTEMS-PA-BOND-RATING--PR_231737 | title=Rating Action: Moody's Downgrades West Penn Allegheny Health System's (PA) Bond Rating to Caa1 from B2; Outlook Remains Negative| publisher=Moody's Investors Service | date=2011-11-22 | accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref>

WPAHS received financial support from a partnership with regional insurance giant [[Highmark]] in 2011. Highmark pledged $475 million over three years to strengthen and acquire the hospital system, however the partnership has prompted a [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] investigation due to anti-trust concerns.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_782403.html | title=Federal investigators take look at Highmark's acquisition plans|first=Jeremy | last=Boren | first2=Alex |last2=Nixon | newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review | date=2012-02-19|accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref>  The system received $100 million through 2011 and  reopened the emergency department at West Penn Hospital.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/health/s_781389.html | title=West Penn Hospital emergency department reopens Tuesday | first=Alex | last=Nixon | newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review | date=2012-02-13 | accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref>
