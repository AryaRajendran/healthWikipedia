'''Molybdenum cofactor deficiency''' is a rare human disease in which the absence of [[molybdenum cofactor]] leads to accumulation of toxic levels of [[sulphite]] and neurological damage. Usually this leads to death within months of birth, due to the lack of active [[sulfite oxidase]]. Furthermore, a mutational block in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis causes absence of enyzme activity of [[xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase]] and [[aldehyde oxidase]].

When caused by a mutation in the [[MOCS1]] gene it is the type A variant.  It can also be caused by a mutation in the [[MOCS2]] gene or the [[GEPH]] gene.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12754701 "Mutations in the molybdenum cofactor biosynthetic genes MOCS1, MOCS2, and GEPH."</ref> As of 2010, there had been approximately 132 reported cases.<ref name="pmid17065069">{{cite journal |author=Ichida K, Aydin HI, Hosoyamada M, ''et al.'' |title=A Turkish case with molybdenum cofactor deficiency |journal=Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids |volume=25 |issue=9-11 |pages=1087â€“91 |year=2006 |pmid=17065069 |doi=10.1080/15257770600894022 |url=}}</ref>

It should not be confused with [[molybdenum deficiency]].

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of Molybdenum cofactor deficiency includes early seizures, low blood levels of [[uric acid]], and high levels of [[sulphite]], [[xanthine]], and [[uric acid]] in [[urine]]. Additionally, the disease produces characteristic MRI images that can aid in diagnosis.<ref>http://www.imoa.info/HSE/environmental_data/biology/molybdenum_cofactor.html</ref>

== Breakthrough ==

In 2009, Monash Children's Hospital at Southern Health in Melbourne, Australia reported that a patient known as Baby Z became the first person to be successfully treated for molybdenum cofactor deficiency type A.  The patient was treated with [[cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate|cPMP]], a precursor of the [[molybdenum cofactor]].<ref name=news.com.au>{{cite news|title=Doctor cures 'Baby Z' of molybdenum cofactor deficiency in medical world first|date=November 5, 2009|work=news.com.au|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,26307721-421,00.html|accessdate=November 5, 2009 | first=Grant | last=McArthur}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Dying baby cured in world first|author=Samantha Donovan|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/05/2734004.htm|date=2009-11-05|work=abc.net.au/news|accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref> Baby Z will require daily injections of [[cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate]] (cPMP) for the rest of her life.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article6903996.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Doctors risk untried drug to stop babys brain dissolving | first=Sophie | last=Tedmanson | date=November 5, 2009 | accessdate=May 13, 2010}}</ref>
