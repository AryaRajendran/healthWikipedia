A '''protein synthesis inhibitor''' is a substance that stops or slows the growth or proliferation of cells by disrupting the processes that lead directly to the generation of new proteins.<ref name="urlDefinition: protein synthesis inhibitor from Online Medical Dictionary">{{cite web |url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?protein+synthesis+inhibitor |title=Definition: protein synthesis inhibitor from Online Medical Dictionary |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

While a broad interpretation of this definition could be used to describe nearly any [[antibiotic]], in practice, it usually refers to substances that act at the [[ribosome]] level (either the ribosome itself or the translation factor),<ref name="urlMIT OpenCourseWare | Biology | 7.344 Antibiotics, Toxins, and Protein Engineering, Spring 2007 | Lecture Notes">{{cite web |url=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Biology/7-344Spring-2007/LectureNotes/index.htm |work=MIT OpenCourseWare |title= 7.344 Antibiotics, Toxins, and Protein Engineering, Spring 2007 |accessdate=}}</ref> taking advantages of the major differences between [[prokaryotic]] and [[eukaryotic]] ribosome structures.

[[Toxin]]s such as [[ricin]] also function via protein synthesis inhibition.<ref name="pmid3167211">{{cite journal |author=Leonard JE, Grothaus CD, Taetle R |title=Ricin binding and protein synthesis inhibition in human hematopoietic cell lines |journal=Blood |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=1357–1363 |year=1988 |month=October |pmid=3167211 |doi= |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3167211}}</ref> Ricin acts at the eukaryotic [[60S]].<ref name="pmid3391162">{{cite journal |author=Terao K, Uchiumi T, Endo Y, Ogata K |title=Ricin and alpha-sarcin alter the conformation of 60S ribosomal subunits at neighboring but different sites |journal=Eur.

Examples:
* [[Neomycin]]
* Geneticin, also called G418

==Mechanism==
In general, protein synthesis inhibitors work at different stages of [[Prokaryotic translation|prokaryotic mRNA translation]] into proteins, like initiation, elongation (including [[aminoacyl tRNA]] entry, [[Proofreading (biology)|proofreading]], [[peptidyl transfer]], and [[ribosomal translocation]]) and termination:

===Earlier stages===
* [[Rifamycin]] inhibits [[Prokaryotic transcription|prokaryotic DNA transcription]] into mRNA by inhibiting DNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]] by binding its beta-subunit.

===Initiation===
* [[Linezolid]] acts at the initiation stage,<ref name="pmid9835522">{{cite journal |author=Swaney SM, Aoki H, Ganoza MC, Shinabarger DL |title=The Oxazolidinone Linezolid Inhibits Initiation of Protein Synthesis in Bacteria |journal=Antimicrob.

===Proofreading===

===Peptidyl transfer===

* [[Puromycin]] has a structure similar to that of the [[tyrosine|tyrosinyl]] aminoacyl-tRNA. Thus, it binds to the ribosomal A site and participates in peptide bond formation, producing peptidyl-puromycin. However, it does not engage in translocation and quickly dissociates from the ribosome, causing a premature termination of polypeptide synthesis.
*[[Streptogramin]]s also cause premature release of the peptide chain.<ref name=lange2008/>
