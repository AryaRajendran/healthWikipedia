'''Medical foods''' are [[food]]s that are specially formulated and intended for the dietary management of a [[disease]] that has distinctive [[nutrition]]al needs that cannot be met by normal diet alone.  They
were defined in the [[Food and Drug Administration]]'s 1988 Orphan Drug Act Amendments<ref name="CFR21.109">{{cite book|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/CFR101-9.HTML|title=CFR 21 Part 101 Subpart A|author=FDA}}</ref> and are subject to the general food and safety labeling requirements of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]].

Medical foods are distinct from the broader category of foods for special dietary use and from traditional foods that bear a [[health claim]]. In order to be considered a medical food the product must, at a minimum:
* be a food for oral ingestion or tube feeding ([[nasogastric tube]])
* be labeled for the dietary management of a specific medical disorder, disease or condition for which there are distinctive nutritional requirements, and
* be intended to be used under medical supervision.

Medical foods can be classified into the following categories:
*Nutritionally complete formulas
*Nutritionally incomplete formulas
*Formulas for metabolic disorders
*Oral rehydration products

==Examples==

===Allergic conditions===
Medical foods for management of [[Allergy|allergic conditions]] may contain both [[gamma-linolenic acid]] (GLA), a short chain [[omega-6 fatty acid]] primarily sourced from the seeds of the borage plant, and [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid sourced from fish.  These [[fatty acids]] help to inhibit the production of [[leukotrienes]] in the system.  Sufficient quantities of GLA and EPA necessary for reduction of leukotrienes cannot be obtained from a normal diet.  Leukotrienes are inflammatory molecules produced by immune cells (neutrophils, basophils, mast cells, macrophages and eosinophils) in the body. They are involved in the [[inflammatory response]] and cause the narrowing of the airways, increased mucus production and tissue swelling associated with both [[allergies]] and [[asthma]]. In order to control allergic symptoms, research shows that it helps to inhibit the production of [[leukotrienes]] in the body.

===Diabetes mellitus===
Medical foods for management of [[diabetes mellitus]] generally contain slowly digested carbohydrates, which helps minimize peaks in blood sugar. Consistent maintenance of optimal blood sugar levels (avoiding highs and lows) over time can help reduce the complications of [[diabetes]].

===Gastrointestinal tract impairment===
Medical foods for management of [[gastrointestinal tract]] (GI tract) impairment provide an amino acid-based diet in its most easily digestible (elemental) form to aid in poor nutrient absorption due to [[digestive disease]], [[malabsorption]], severe [[food allergies]], or other conditions in which the GI tract is severely compromised.

===Metabolic stress===
Medical foods for management of metabolically stressed patients provide supplemental [[glutamine]] to nourish the GI tract and restore glutamine while a patient is in a stressed, catabolic state.

==Regulation==
Medical foods are regulated by the [[US Food and Drug Administration]] under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act regulations.  21 CFR 101.9(j) (8).<ref  name="CFR21.109"/>  

The term medical food, as defined in section 5(b) of the [[Orphan Drug Act of 1983|Orphan Drug Act]] (21 U.S.C. 360ee (b) (3)) is "a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation."<ref>http://www.fda.gov/food/foodsafety/product-specificinformation/medicalfoods/default.htm</ref>

Medical foods are not required to undergo premarket review or approval by FDA.  Additionally, they are exempted from the labeling requirements for health claims and nutrient content claims under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/GuidanceDocuments/MedicalFoods/ucm054048.htm</ref>
