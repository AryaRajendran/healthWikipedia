'''MenAfriVac''' is a vaccine developed for use in sub-Saharan Africa that protects people 1 to 29 years of age against [[meningococcal bacterium Neisseria meningitidis group A]]. MenAfriVac costs under US$.50 per dose and reduces carriage of the bacteria from one person to another.<ref>{{cite web|last= Butler|first=Declan|title=Vaccine offers meningitis hope|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101109/full/468143a.html?s=news_rss|work=November 9, 2010|publisher=Nature News|accessdate=24 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Bowdler|first=Neil|title=New jab for millions across African ‘meningitis belt|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11813238|work=November 22, 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=November 23, 2010|date=22 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=New Meningitis Vaccine a ‘Revolution|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201010140944.html|work=October 14, 2010|publisher=allAfrica.com|accessdate=November 24, 2010}}</ref> The [[Meningitis Vaccine Project]], a partnership between the [[Program for Appropriate Technology in Health]] (PATH) and the [[World Health Organization]], worked with a consortium of international partners to develop the vaccine.<ref name="Anderson">{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Tatum|title=Africa hails new meningitis vaccine|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11534311|work=14 October 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 November 2010|date=14 October 2010}}</ref>

== History ==
The largest meningitis epidemic in African history swept across sub-Saharan Africa from 1996 to 1997, numbering 250,000 new cases of the disease and taking 25,000 lives. Three years later, the World Health Organization held a technical consultation in Cairo, Egypt with African ministers of health and global health leaders to discuss meningitis and the development of a new vaccine. At that meeting, representatives from eight African countries issued a statement saying that the development of a meningococcal vaccine to prevent epidemics was a high priority for them, and concluded that a conjugate meningococcal vaccine would have the potential to prevent future epidemics. They estimated that the new vaccine could become available in three to seven years for US$ 0.40 to $ 1 a dose, providing protection for at least ten years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Improved meningitis vaccine for Africa could signal eventual end to deadly scourge|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2007/pr28/en/|work=8 June 2007|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=24 November 2010}}</ref>

A year later, in 2001, the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] provided a ten-year, $70 million grant to establish the [[Meningitis Vaccine Project]], a partnership between PATH and the World Health Organization. The foundation charged the new project with development, testing, licensure, and mass introduction of a meningococcal conjugate vaccine.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Announces Grant for the Elimination of Epidemic Meningitis in Sub-Saharan Africa|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/press-releases/Pages/path-and-who-receive-grant-010530.aspx|work=May 30, 2001|publisher=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|accessdate=24 November 2010}}</ref> In 2002, the newly-funded collaboration supported reinforced meningitis surveillance activities in 12 countries in Africa: [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], [[Côte d’Ivoire]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Ghana]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Togo]]. Data from the surveillance indicated an increased risk of outbreaks in the future and the continued need for a conjugate A meningitis vaccine.<ref>{{cite web|title=WHO weekly epidemiology record|url=http://www.who.int/wer/2005/wer8037.pdf|work=September 16. 2005|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=24 November 2010}}</ref> MenAfriVac is available for widespread use in [[African meningitis belt]] countries.<ref name="Anderson"/>

==Manufacture==
The Meningitis Vaccine Project partnered with [[SynCo Bio Partners]], a Dutch biotech company, and the US government’s [[Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research]] to develop MenAfriVac, and the [[Serum Institute of India]] to manufacture it.

MenAfriVac is a [[Freeze-drying|freeze-dried]] vaccine of a [[polysaccharide]] from a type of [[Neisseria meningitidis]] called group A.  The polysaccharide has been purified by [[affinity chromatography]] and bound to a [[carrier protein]] called [[Tetanospasmin|tetanus toxoid]]. The TT is prepared by extraction by [[ammonium sulfate precipitation]] and the toxin is inactivated with [[Formaldehyde|formalin]] the toxin from cultures of [[Clostridium tetani]] grown in a modified [[Mueller-Hinton agar]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.seruminstitute.com/content/products/product_menafrivac.htm |title=MenAfriVac Meningococcal A Conjugate Vaccine |first= |last= |publisher=[[Serum Institute of India]] |work=seruminstitute.com |year=2011 |accessdate=17 June 2011}}</ref>
