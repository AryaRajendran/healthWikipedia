==Gene location==

The human ''BRCA1'' gene is located on the long (q) arm of [[chromosome 17 (human)|chromosome 17]] at region 2 band 1, from [[base pair]] 41,196,312 to base pair 41,277,500 (Build GRCh37/hg19) [http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19&singleSearch=knownCanonical&position=BRCA1 (map)].<ref>National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/672 EntrezGene reference information for BRCA1 breast cancer 1, early onset (Homo sapiens)]</ref> ''BRCA1'' [[orthologs]]<ref name="OrthoMaM">{{cite web | title = OrthoMaM phylogenetic marker: BRCA1 coding sequence | url = http://www.orthomam.univ-montp2.fr/orthomam/data/cds/detailMarkers/ENSG00000012048_BRCA1.xml }}</ref> have been identified in most [[mammals]] for which complete genome data are available.

==Protein structure==
The BRCA1 [[protein]] contains the following domains:<ref name="pmid9553742">{{cite journal | author = Paterson JW | title = BRCA1: a review of structure and putative functions | journal = Dis.

* Zinc finger, C3HC4 type ([[RING finger domain|RING finger]])
* BRCA1 C Terminus ([[BRCT domain|BRCT]]) domain
This protein also contains [[nuclear localization signal]] and [[nuclear export signal]] motifs.<ref name="pmid16108063">{{cite journal | author = Henderson BR | title = Regulation of BRCA1, BRCA2 and BARD1 intracellular trafficking | journal = BioEssays | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 884–93 | year = 2005 | month = September | pmid = 16108063 | doi = 10.1002/bies.20277   }}</ref>

The human [[BRCA1 protein]] consists of four major protein domains; the [[RING finger domain|Znf C3HC4- RING domain]], the BRCA1 serine domain and two [[BRCT domain|BRCT]] domains. These domains encode approximately 27% of BRCA1 protein. There are six known isoforms of {{uniprot|P38398}} BRCA1, with isoforms 1 and 2 comprising 1863 amino acids each.

=== Zinc ring finger domain ===

The [[RING finger domain|RING motif]], a [[Zn finger]] found in eukaryotic peptides, is 40-60 amino acids long and consists of eight conserved metal-binding residues, two quartets of [[cysteine]] or [[histidine]] residues that coordinate two zinc atoms.<ref name="pmid11573085">{{cite journal | author = Brzovic PS, Rajagopal P, Hoyt DW, King MC, Klevit RE | title = Structure of a BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimeric RING-RING complex | journal = Nat. Struct. Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 10 | pages = 833–7 | year = 2001 | month = October | pmid = 11573085 | doi = 10.1038/nsb1001-833 }}</ref>  This motif contains a short anti-parallel [[beta-sheet]], two zinc binding loops and a central [[alpha helix]] in a small domain.  This [[RING]] domain interacts with associated proteins including [[BARD1]], which also contains a RING motif, to form a heterodimer. The BRCA1 [[RING]] motif is flanked by alpha helices formed by residues 8-22 and 81-96 of the BRCA1 protein. It interacts with a homologous region in [[BARD1]] also consisting of a RING finger flanked by two [[alpha-helices]] formed from residues 36-48 and 101-116. These four helices combine to form a [[heterodimerization]] interface and stabilise the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer complex. Additional stabilisation is achieved by interactions between adjacent residues in the flanking region and hydrophobic interactions. The BARD1/BRCA1 interaction is disrupted by tumorigenic amino acid substitutions in BRCA1, implying that the formation of a stable complex between these proteins may be an essential aspect of BRCA1 tumor suppression.<ref name="pmid11573085"/>

The ring domain is an important element of [[Ubiquitin_ligase#Individual_E3_ubiquitin_ligases|ubiquitin E3 ligases]] which catalyse protein ubiquitination2. [[Ubiquitin]] is a small regulatory protein found in all tissues which directs proteins to compartments within the cell. BRCA1 polypeptides, in particular Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains, are dispersed throughout within the resting cell nucleus but when [[DNA replication]] begins they gather in restrained groups that also contain [[BRCA2]] and BARD1. BARD1 is thought to be involved in the recognition and binding of protein targets for ubiquitination.<ref name="pmid11573079">{{cite journal | author = Baer R | title = With the ends in sight: images from the BRCA1 tumor suppressor | journal = Nat. Struct. Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 10 | pages = 822–4 | year = 2001 | month = October | pmid = 11573079 | doi = 10.1038/nsb1001-822 }}</ref> It attaches to proteins and labels them for destruction. Ubiquitination occurs via the BRCA1 fusion protein and is abolished by zinc [[chelation]].<ref name="pmid11573085"/> The enzyme activity of the fusion protein is dependent on the proper folding of the ring domain.

=== Serine cluster domain ===

The BRCA1 serine cluster domain (SCD) spans amino acids 1280-1524. A portion of the domain is located in exons 11-13. High rates of mutation occur in exons 11-13. Reported phosphorylation sites of BRCA1 are concentrated in the SCD where they are phosphorylated by [[ataxia telangiectasia mutated|ATM/ATR kinases]] both [[in vitro]] and [[in vivo]]. ATM/ATR are kinases activated by [[DNA damage]]. Mutation of serine residues may affect localization of BRCA1 to sites of [[DNA damage]] and DNA damage response function.<ref name="pmid22737296">{{cite journal | author = Clark SL, Rodriguez AM, Snyder RR, Hankins GD, Boehning D | title = Structure-Function Of The Tumor Suppressor BRCA1 | journal = Comput Struct Biotechnol J | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = | year = 2012 | month = April | pmid = 22737296 | pmc = 3380633 | doi = 10.5936/csbj.201204005 }}</ref>

=== BRCT domains ===

The dual repeat [[BRCT domain]] of the BRCA1 protein is an elongated structure approximately 70 Å long and 30-35 Å wide.<ref name="Williams_2001">{{cite journal | author = Williams RS, Green R, Glover JN | title = Crystal structure of the BRCT repeat region from the breast cancer-associated protein BRCA1 | journal = Nat.

These all contribute to the tightly packed knob-in-hole structure that comprises the interface. These homologous domains interact to control cellular responses to [[DNA damage]]. It is therefore no surprise, that a [[missense mutation]] at the interface of these two proteins can have devastating consequences on the [[cell cycle]], resulting in protein dysfunction and a greater risk of developing cancer.  The linker that joins these two homologs also needs to be considered, since its poorly defined [[electron density]] alludes to a possible complex function; the ability to flex.<ref name="Williams_2001"/>

==Function and mechanism==

BRCA1 repairs double-strand breaks in DNA. The strands of the DNA double helix are continuously breaking from damage. Sometimes one strand is broken, and sometimes both strands are broken simultaneously. DNA cross linking agents are an important source of chromosome/DNA damage. Double strand breaks occur as intermediates after the cross links are removed. BRCA1 is part of a protein complex that repairs DNA when both strands are broken. When both strands are broken, it is difficult for the repair mechanism to "know" how to replace the correct DNA sequence, and there are multiple ways to attempt the repair. The double-stranded repair mechanism that BRCA1 participates in is [[homologous recombination]], in which the repair proteins utilize homologous intact sequence from a [[sister chromatid]], from a [[homologous chromosome]], or from the same chromosome (depending on cell cycle phase) as a template.<ref>[http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/D/DNArepair.html#DSBs Kimball's Biologh Pages]</ref> This DNA repair takes place with the DNA in the cell nucleus, wrapped around the [[histone]]. Several proteins, including BRCA1, arrive at the histone-DNA complex for this repair. Regulatory aspect to BRCA1 nuclear ⁄ non-nuclear distribution was first shown by Dr Rao laboratory in 1997<ref name="pmid9244350">{{cite journal | author= Wang H, Shao N, Ding QM, Cui J, Reddy ES, Rao VN | title = BRCA1 proteins are transported to the nucleus in the absence of serum and splice variants BRCA1a, BRCA1b are tyrosine phosphoproteins that associate with E2F, cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases | journal = Oncogene | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–57 | year = 1997 | month = Jul | pmid = 9244350 | doi =  10.1038/sj.onc.1201252| url =  }}</ref> 

In the nucleus of many types of normal cells, the BRCA1 protein interacts  with [[RAD51]] during repair of DNA double-strand breaks.<ref name="pmid17052168">{{cite journal | author = Boulton SJ | title = Cellular functions of the BRCA tumour-suppressor proteins | journal = Biochem. Soc. Trans. | volume = 34 | issue = Pt 5 | pages = 633–45 | year = 2006 | month = November | pmid = 17052168 | doi = 10.1042/BST0340633 }}</ref> These breaks can be caused by natural radiation or other exposures, but also occur when [[chromosome]]s exchange genetic material (homologous recombination, e.g., "crossing over" during meiosis). The [[BRCA2]] protein, which has a function similar to that of BRCA1, also interacts with the RAD51 protein. By influencing DNA damage repair, these three proteins play a role in maintaining the stability of the human genome.

BRCA1 directly binds to DNA, with higher affinity for branched DNA structures. This ability to bind to DNA contributes to its ability to inhibit the nuclease activity of the [[Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1|MRN]] complex as well as the nuclease activity of Mre11 alone.<ref name=Paull2001>{{cite journal| author = Paull TT, Cortez D, Bowers B, Elledge SJ, Gellert M | year = 2001| title = Direct DNA binding by Brca1| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| pages = 6086–6091| doi = 10.1073/pnas.111125998| volume = 98| pmid = 11353843| issue = 11| pmc = 33426}}</ref> This may explain a role for BRCA1 to promote lower fidelity DNA repair by [[non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ).<ref name=Durant2005>{{cite journal| doi = 10.4161/cc.4.9.2027| author = Durant ST, Nickoloff JA | year = 2005| title = Good timing in the cell cycle for precise DNA repair by BRCA1| journal = Cell Cycle| volume = 4| issue = 9| pages = 1216–22| pmid = 16103751}}</ref> BRCA1 also colocalizes with γ-H2AX (histone H2AX phosphorylated on serine-139) in DNA double-strand break repair foci, indicating it may play a role in recruiting repair factors.<ref name=Starita2003 /><ref name=Ye2001>{{cite journal | author = Ye Q, Hu YF, Zhong H, Nye AC, Belmont AS, Li R | year = 2001 | title = BRCA1-induced large-scale chromatin unfolding and allele-specific effects of cancer-predisposing mutations | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 155 | issue = 6 | pages = 911–922 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.200108049 | pmid = 11739404 | pmc = 2150890 }}</ref>

===Other roles===
Research suggests that both the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins regulate the activity of other genes and play a critical role in embryo development. The BRCA1 protein probably interacts with many other proteins, including tumor suppressors and regulators of the cell division cycle.

==Mutations and cancer risk==
{{Further|BRCA mutation}}
Certain variations of the ''BRCA1'' gene lead to an increased risk for [[breast cancer]] as part of a [[hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome]]. Researchers have identified hundreds of [[mutation]]s in the ''BRCA1'' gene, many of which are associated with an increased risk of cancer. Women with an abnormal BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene have up to a 80% risk of developing breast cancer by age 90; increased risk of developing ovarian cancer is about 55% for women with BRCA1 mutations and about 25% for women with BRCA2 mutations.<ref name="urlGenetics">{{cite web | url = http://www.breastcancer.org/risk/factors/genetics | title = Genetics | author = | date = 2012-09-17  | work = | publisher = Breastcancer.org | accessdate = }}</ref>

These mutations can be changes in one or a small number of DNA [[base pair]]s (the building-blocks of DNA). Those mutations can be identified with PCR and DNA sequencing.

In some cases, large segments of DNA are rearranged. Those large segments, also called large rearrangements, can be a deletion or a duplication of one or several exons in the gene.

A mutated ''BRCA1'' gene usually makes a [[protein]] that does not function properly because it is abnormally short. Researchers believe that the defective BRCA1 protein is unable to help fix mutations that occur in other genes. These defects accumulate and may allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor.

BRCA1 mRNA [[three prime untranslated region|3' UTR]] can be bound by an [[miRNA]], [[Mir-17 microRNA precursor family|Mir-17 microRNA]]. It has been suggested that variations in this miRNA along with [[Mir-30 microRNA precursor|Mir-30 microRNA]] could confer susceptibility to breast cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shen J, Ambrosone CB, Zhao H |title=Novel genetic variants in microRNA genes and familial breast cancer |journal=Int. J. Cancer |volume=124 |issue=5 |pages=1178–82 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19048628 |doi=10.1002/ijc.24008}}</ref>

In addition to breast cancer, mutations in the ''BRCA1'' gene also increase the risk of [[ovarian cancer|ovarian]], [[fallopian tube]], and [[prostate cancer]]s. Moreover, precancerous lesions ([[dysplasia]]) within the Fallopian tube have been linked to ''BRCA1'' gene mutations. Pathogenic mutations anywhere in a model pathway containing BRCA1 and BRCA2 greatly increase risks for a subset of leukemias and lymphomas.<ref name="pmid17683622"/>

Women having inherited a defective BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene have risks for breast and ovarian cancer that are so high and seem so selective that many mutation carriers choose to have prophylactic surgery. There has been much conjecture to explain such apparently striking tissue specificity. Major determinants of where BRCA1/2 hereditary cancers occur are related to tissue specificity of the cancer pathogen, the agent that causes chronic inflammation or the carcinogen. The target tissue may have receptors for the pathogen, become selectively exposed to an inflammatory process or to a carcinogen. An innate genomic deficit in a tumor suppressor gene impairs normal responses and exacerbates the susceptibility to disease in organ targets. This theory also fits data for several tumor suppressors beyond BRCA1 or BRCA2. A major advantage of this model is that it suggests there may be some options in addition to prophylactic surgery.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Germ line mutations and founder effect==

All germ-line BRCA1 mutations identified to date have been inherited, suggesting the possibility of a large “founder” effect in which a certain mutation is common to a well-defined population group and can, in theory, be traced back to a common ancestor. Given the complexity of mutation screening for BRCA1, these common mutations may simplify the methods required for mutation screening in certain populations. Analysis of mutations that occur with high frequency also permits the study of their clinical expression.<ref name="Lacroix2005">{{cite journal | author = [[Marc Lacroix (biochemist)|Lacroix M]], Leclercq G | title= The "portrait" of hereditary breast cancer | journal= Breast Cancer Research and Treatment | year=2005 | volume=89 |pages=297–304 | pmid= 15754129 | doi=10.1007/s10549-004-2172-4 | issue=3  }}</ref> Examples of manifestations of a founder effect are seen among Ashkenazi Jews.

According to an article published in the journal, Genetic Medicine, in 2010, "The patent story outside the United States is more complicated.... For example, patents have been obtained but the patents are being ignored by provincial health systems in Canada. In Australia and the UK, Myriad’s licensee permitted use by health systems, but announced a change of plans in August 2008. ... Only a single mutation has been patented in Myriad’s lone European-wide patent, although some patents remain under review of an opposition proceeding.
