==Human==
'''Brodmann area 18''', or BA18, is part of the [[occipital lobe|occipital]] [[cerebral cortex | cortex]] in the [[human brain]]. It accounts for the bulk of the volume of the occipital lobe. It is known as a "Visual Association Area" and is responsible for the interpretation of images.

This area is also known as parastriate area 18. It is a subdivision of the [[cytoarchitecture|cytoarchitecturally]] defined occipital region of [[cerebral cortex]]. In the human it is located in parts of the [[cuneus]], the [[lingual gyrus]] and the [[lateral occipital gyrus]] (H) of the [[occipital lobe]]. Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded on one side by the [[Brodmann area 17]], from which it is distinguished by absence of a [[band of Gennari]], and on the other by the [[peristriate area 19]] (Brodmann-1909). 

==Guenon==
'''Brodmann area 18''' is a subdivision of the cerebral cortex of the [[guenon]] defined on the basis of cytoarchitecture. It is topographically and cytoarchitecturally [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to parastriate area 18 of the human (Brodmann-1909). Distinctive features (Brodmann-1905): a wide, dense internal [[granular cell]] layer (IV); a distinct sublayer 3b of closely packed large [[pyramidal cell]]s positioned in the external [[pyramidal layer]] (III) directly above layer IV; an almost cell free, narrow internal pyramidal layer (V) with no larger [[ganglion cell]]s; a likewise very narrow, dense [[multiform layer]] (VI) composed of small [[polymorphic cell]]s that form a distinct boundary with the underlying subcortical [[white matter]]. Like [[area 17 of Brodmann]]-1905, area 18 is relatively thin; the three deep layers are thin relative to the three outer layers; distinct boundaries between layers; abundance of [[granule cell]]s; narrow layer VI; and sharp boundary between cortex and subcortical white matter.
