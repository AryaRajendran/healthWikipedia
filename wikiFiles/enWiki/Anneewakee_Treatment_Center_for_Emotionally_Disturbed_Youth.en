The '''Anneewakee Treatment Center for Emotionally Disturbed Youth''' was a [[Douglasville, Georgia]], [[USA]], based adolescent treatment center which changed name to the New Annewakee, Inner Harbour Hospital and now Inner Harbour, Ltd (DBA)Inner Harbour for Children and Families. There was physical and sexual abuse, exploitation of child labor, and deprivation of education in the 1980s.<ref>http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1990/Settlement-Ends-Psychiatric-Center-Suits/id-b923b6ea58de5f1f42011b9d1e7c50ac</ref>

Opening in 1962, the center was a [[wilderness therapy|wilderness treatment]] center for troubled boys. Anneewakee expanded from the single Douglasville, Georgia, center to include a boys campus near [[Carrabelle, Florida]] and a girls campus near [[Rockmart, Georgia]].

Scandals emerged in the 1980s with decades long history of forced [[child labor]], [[sexual abuse]] and [[physical abuse]]. Survivors of this center today range from people who say it saved their lives, to people who refer to it as the [[Chernobyl]] of treatment centers.

Anneewakee is now an organization now known as Inner Harbour Ltd or DBA Inner Harbour for Children & Families. After the scandals, the court awarded the management of the organization to Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) out of Nashville, TN. A medical model was instituted where care is supervised by medical doctors/psychiatrists. 

Today it helps children and their families. It is a 501(c)3 private non profit organization that treated around 850 children and their families in 2008.  Inner Harbour is accredited by both the Joint Commission on Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)and Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). It is  licensed in Georgia as a Residential Mental Health Facility (RMHF) and a (PRTF) Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility.
