'''Anti-gliadin antibodies''' are produced in response to [[gliadin]], a [[prolamin]] found in [[wheat]]. In [[bread wheat]] it is encoded by three different [[allele]]s, AA, BB, and DD. These alleles can produce slightly different gliadins, which can cause the body to produce different [[antibody|antibodies]]. Some of these antibodies can detect [[protein]]s in specific grass [[taxa]] such as ''[[Triticeae]]'' ([[Triticeae glutens|''Triticeae'' glutens]]), while others react sporadically with certain species in those taxa, or over many [[taxonomic]]ally defined grass [[tribe (biology)|tribe]]s.

'''What is the relationship of gluten and anti-gliadin antibodies?'''. In [[gluten sensitivity|gluten-sensitive]] individuals AGA testing is a routinely used blood test for possible presence of coeliac disease, allergies or idiopathic phenomena. The measurement of AGA is done with [[ELISA]] or radioimmunoassay. Such tests measure the level of AGA relative to a standard, such as a level of 10 = point which 85% of normal population falls below. Greater than 10 equals disease and a value of 3 is expected (mean). 

Individuals who have coeliac disease may have values in excess of 200. There is the common expectation that removal of gluten results in the loss of AGA; however, since gluten is the target of the antibodies, that which would deplete them from the body, removal of gluten results in the benign circulation of antibodies. The half life of these antibodies is typically 120 days. Given an expected normal of 3 and assuming that the individual starts with a score of 203, we can predict the levels of AGA at various future time points. Based on these initial numbers, patients with very high
AGA values may take 2 years to return to the normal range. 

'''Refractory coeliac disease''' (RCD). [[Gluten-sensitive_enteropathy_associated_conditions#GSEA_Cancers|RCD]] or non-strict gluten-free diet are two causes of failure of AGA to return to normality on the GF diet. In the first instance lymphocytes may remain stimulated even though the antigen that originally stimulated them was removed from the diet.

==Diagnostic serology==
Anti-gliadin antibodies were one of the first serological markers for coeliac disease. Problematic with AGA is the typical sensitivity and specificity was about 85%. Gliadin peptides which are synthesized as the deamidated form have much higher sensitivity and specificity, creating 2 serological tests for CD that approach

==Uses of anti-gliadin antibodies in testing==
Anti-gliadin antibodies can be generated in mice or rabbits by immunizing whole purified gliadins, proteolytic fragments of gliadin, or synthetic peptides that represent epitopes of gliadin. After developing an immune response, B-cells from mice can be fused with immortalizing cells to form a [[hybridoma]] that produces [[monoclonal antibodies]] (Mab or MoAb). Mab can be expressed in culture or via [[ascites|ascites fluid]] production to produce large amounts of a single antibody isoform. 

Mab can be used to detect levels of [[gluten]] in food products. Some of these antibodies can recognize only [[wheat]] [[prolamin]]s or very closely related grass seeds; others can detect [[antigen]]s over broad [[taxa]]. The G12 antibody is the newest example, developed by the Spanish company Biomedal. It recognizes the toxic fraction of wheat, barley, rye and also of oat.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Comino|first=Isabel|coauthors=Ana Real, Laura de Lorenzo, Hugh Cornell, Miguel Ángel López-Casado, Francisco Barro, Pedro Lorite, Ma Isabel Torres, Ángel Cebolla, Carolina Sousa|title=Diversity in oat potential immunogenicity: basis for the selection of oat varieties with no toxicity in coeliac disease|journal=Gut|date=12|year=2011|month=February|issue=First Online|url=http://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2011/02/11/gut.2010.225268.abstract|accessdate=12 March 2011|pmid=21317420|doi=10.1136/gut.2010.225268|volume=60|pages=915–22|pmc=3112367}}</ref> The R5 sandwich assay is another such assay. This assay can recognize wheat, barley and rye, which makes it ideal for evaluating the presence of contaminants in gluten-free foods that do not contain oat. This antibody is a recommended testing protocol in a proposed revision of the [[Codex Alimentarius]]. 

The new standards came about in part because of new sensitive and specific testing procedures.<ref name= CAC_GF>''"Draft Revised Standard for Foods for Special Dietary Use for Persons intolerant to Gluten (at Step 8)"''. page 50-51.
