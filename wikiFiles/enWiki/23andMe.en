'''23andMe''' is a privately held [[personal genomics]] and [[biotechnology]] company based in [[Mountain View, California]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.manta.com/coms2/dnbcompany_6k1rd8 |title=23andMe, Inc. Company Profile |publisher=Manta.com }}</ref> that provides rapid genetic testing. The company is named for the 23 pairs of [[chromosome]]s in a normal human [[cell (biology)|cell]]. Their personal genome test kit was named "Invention of the Year" by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] in 2008.<ref name = Time/>

==Founding==
The company was founded by [[Linda Avey]], Paul Cusenza and [[Anne Wojcicki]] after they recognized the need for a way to organize and study genetic data, the possibility for individual consumers to use the information and the need for expertise to interpret the results.<ref name = Wired2011>{{cite web | url = http://www.wired.com/medtech/genetics/magazine/15-12/ff_genomics?currentPage=all | title = 23AndMe Will Decode Your DNA for $1,000.

Cusenza left the company in 2007 and has been CEO of Nodal Exchange since 2008.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.nodalexchange.com/about_nodal/management_team.php |title = Nodal Exchange Management Team }}</ref>

Avey left the company in 2009 to establish a [[Foundation (non-profit)|foundation]] for the causes and treatment of [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2009/08/31/daily96.html | title = Co-founder Avey leaves 23andMe  | publisher = [[American City Business Journals|San Jose Business Journal]] | date = 2009-09-04 | accessdate = 2012-04-05 }}</ref>

==Services==
23andMe began offering DNA testing services in November, 2007, the results of which are posted online and allow an assessment of [[Heredity|inherited traits]], [[genealogy]] and possible [[congenital disorder|congenital risk factors]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2007-11-20-23andme-launch_N.htm|title=Google-backed 23andMe offers $999 DNA test|accessdate=2012-04-05 | work= [[USA Today]] | first=L|last=Baertlein|date=2007-11-20}}</ref>  Customers provide a 2.5 [[Litre#SI prefixes applied to the litre|mL]] spit sample which is analyzed on a [[DNA microarray]] manufactured by [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]], for 960,000 specific [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs).  An eventual goal is to provide [[whole genome sequencing]].<ref name = Wired2011/>  In June 2011, 23andMe announced it had accumulated a database of more than 100,000 individuals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.23andme.com/about/press/23andme_database_100000k_users/ |title=23andMe Database Surpasses 100,000 Users | publisher= 23andMe |accessdate=2012-02-21 }}</ref>  The organization also provides testing for certain research initiatives<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.23andme.com/research/ | title = 23andWe Research | accessdate = 2012-04-05 | publisher = 23andMe }}</ref> providing confidential customer datasets to and partnering with research foundations with a goal of establishing genetic associations with specific illnesses and disorders.<ref name = Wired2011/>  Co-founder of [[Google]] [[Sergey Brin]] (whose mother suffers from [[Parkinson's disease]] and who is married to 23andMe co-founder Anne Wojcicki) underwrote the cost of the company's Parkinson's disease genetics initiative to provide free testing for people suffering from the condition.<ref>{{cite web | last = Epstein | first = N | title = Genia Brin’s Double Parkinson’s Mutation | url = http://momentmag.com/moment/issues/2012/08/sciencewatch_brin.html | publisher = [[Moment (magazine)|Moment]] | accessdate=2012-07-17 }}</ref>  An analysis of the results of research on [[Parkinson's disease]] comparing 23andMe with a [[National Institutes of Health]] initiative suggested that the company's use of large amounts of computational power and datasets might offer comparable results, though in much less time.<ref name = Wired2010>{{cite web | url = http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/06/ff_sergeys_search/all/1 | title = Sergey Brin’s Search for a Parkinson’s Cure | last = Goetz | first = S | date = 2010-06-22 | accessdate = 2012-04-05 | publisher = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref>  

In 2008, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named the company's [[saliva]]-based [[DNA]]-testing service "Invention of the Year".  The service and ability to map significant portions of the genome has raised controversial questions including whether the results can be meaningfully interpreted, and if they will lead to [[genetic discrimination]].  The states of [[New York]] and [[California]] unsuccessfully attempted to block the tests (provided by 23andMe as well as other companies) under the grounds that they were not properly [[Licensing|licensed]]<ref name = Time>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1852747_1854493,00.html | title = TIME's Best Inventions of 2008 | publisher = ''[[Time magazine]]'' | date=2008-10-29 | accessdate = 2012-04-05 }}</ref> and attempted to require tests to be conducted only when ordered by a physician.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2008/04/17/genes-regulation-testing-biz-cx_mh_bl_0418genes.html |title=States Crack Down On Online Gene Tests |author=Robert Langreth and Matthew Herper |publisher=Forbes.com |date=2008-04-18 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/17/AR2008061702720.html |title=Cease And Desist: California Tries to Unravel 23andMe's Genetic Testing |author=Jason Kincaid |work=TechCrunch.com |publisher=WashingtonPost.com |date=2008-06-18 }}</ref>  By August 2008, 23andMe had received licenses that allow them to continue to do business in California.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/business/20gene.html?_r=4&ref=health&oref=slogin&oref=slogin&oref=slogin&oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | first=Andrew | last=Pollack | title=California Licenses 2 Companies to Offer Gene Services | date=2008-08-20}}</ref>

In 2007, [[Google]], whose co-founder [[Sergey Brin]] is married to the co-founder of 23andMe [[Anne Wojcicki]], invested $3,900,000 in the company, along with [[Genentech]], [[New Enterprise Associates]] and [[Mohr Davidow Ventures]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Google invests in genetics firm |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6682451.stm |publisher=[[BBC]] News |date=2007-05-22 |accessdate=2007-06-28 }}</ref>

In 2012, 23andMe raised $50 million in a Series D [[venture round]], almost doubling its existing financing of $52.6 million. This enabled the company to further reduce the price of its product, which was originally priced at $999, from $299 to $99 in an effort to increase its customer base from 180,000 to one million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Release: 23andMe Raises More Than $50 Million in New Financing|url=https://www.23andme.com/about/press/12_11_2012/|date=11 December 2012|publisher=23andme.com|accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Tsotsis|first=Alexia|title=Another $50M Richer, 23andMe Drops Its Price To $99 Permanently.
