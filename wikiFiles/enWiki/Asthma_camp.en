The camp counselor role is fulfilled by [[respiratory therapists]] and [[registered nurses]] in order to provide a safe and positive experience for children who would otherwise not be able to go to a summer camp.  Asthma camps aim to provide a positive experience for children with asthma through activities like hiking, swimming, canoeing, rope games, arts and crafts, campfires and more all with special considerations and attention to asthma.  Children that attend asthma camps tend to have improved asthma self-management skills and an increase in overall quality of life.<ref name="pmid18219829">{{cite journal| author=Welch MJ, Carlson AM, Larson D, Fena P| title=Clinical profile, health-related quality of life, and asthma control in children attending US asthma camps. | journal=Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol | year= 2007 | volume= 99 | issue= 6 | pages= 496–501 | pmid=18219829 | doi=10.1016/S1081-1206(10)60377-8 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=18219829  }}</ref>
