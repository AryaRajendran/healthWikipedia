'''[[Frédéric Chopin]]'s disease''', and the reason for his premature death at age 39, remain unclear.  Though he was diagnosed in his lifetime with [[tuberculosis]] and treated for it, since his death in 1849 a number of alternative diagnoses have been suggested.

Frédéric Chopin was, from childhood, sickly and under medical care. He showed intolerance of fatty foods, especially pork &ndash; these caused [[stomachache]]s, [[diarrhea]] and weight loss. Later he endeavored to avoid such symptoms with diet; he obtained substantial improvement with ingredients such as [[honey]] and [[oat bran]]. Chopin attained a height of {{convert|170|cm|ftin}} — the 25th [[percentile]]; and at age 28 he weighed {{convert|45|kg|lb}} — below the 3rd percentile.

Chopin is known at 22 to have had no [[facial hair]]: as he wrote in the winter of 1832, he grew [[sideburns]] on only one side of his face.<ref name="a">{{Cite journal|last1=Kuzemko |first1=JA |title=Chopin's illnesses |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=87 |issue=12 |pages=769–72 |year=1994 |pmid=7853308 |pmc=1294992}}</ref> In 1826 he was sick for six months, suffering from enlarged [[cervical lymph nodes]] and severe [[headache]]s. In 1830 a chronic cold caused nasal [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] which prompted him to cancel planned concerts in Vienna. 

In 1831, in Paris, 21-year-old Chopin experienced his first [[hemoptysis]] (coughing up of blood). In 1835 he suffered a severe two-month [[laryngitis]] and [[bronchitis]], and the resulting interruption in his correspondence with Warsaw gave rise to gossip that he had died.<ref>John O'Shea: Music & Medicine: Medical Profiles of Great Composers. London: Dent, 1990, p. 144. ISBN 0-460-86106-9</ref> 

In early youth he treated himself with [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]]. In the final decade of his life, he treated the coughing fits from which he had suffered all his life, with a blend of sugar and [[opium]]. Chopin coughed up abundant [[mucus]], especially about ten in the morning.<ref>John O'Shea: Music & Medicine: Medical Profiles of Great Composers. London: Dent, 1990, p. 143. ISBN 0-460-86106-9</ref> He occasionally drank alcohol, sometimes smoked and &ndash; as some authors noted &ndash; suffered the consequences of inhaling others' smoke while enjoying the company of his Parisian friends.<ref name="a" /> In the last year of his life, he endured diarrheas, caused either by [[cor pulmonale]] or by [[exocrine pancreatic insufficiency]] (see below).

On 17 October 1849, at 2 a.m., after a sudden coughing fit, Chopin died in the 39th year of his life. His physician, [[Jean Cruveilhier]], confirmed his death by holding a mirror to Chopin's mouth and by illuminating his pupils with light from a candle. Pursuant to Chopin's will, Dr. Cruveilhier, a renowned professor of [[pathology]], carried out an [[autopsy]]. The postmortem report was destroyed either in the Paris fire of 1871 or during World War Two. The [[death certificate]] stated the cause of Chopin's death as tuberculosis of the lungs and larynx. However, [[Wojciech Grzymała]], in a letter to [[Auguste Leo]] dated October 1849, wrote that the autopsy had not confirmed tubercular pulmonary changes and that his actual disease was unknown to contemporary medicine. The postmortem findings were also communicated to Chopin's sister [[Ludwika Jędrzejewicz|Ludwika]], [[Adolf Guttmann]] and [[Jane Stirling]], and their later letters were consistent as to the findings.<ref>John O'Shea: Music & Medicine: Medical Profiles of Great Composers. London: Dent, 1990, p. 149. ISBN 0-460-86106-9</ref>

==Physicians==
It is uncertain how many physicians Chopin had; various authors have given the number as 14,<ref>K. Barry, "Chopin and His Fourteen Doctors", Sydney Austral. Med. Publish. Co., 1934, cited from Sielużycki, 1976.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> 31<ref name="sieluzycki">{{cite journal | author = Sielużycki C | year = 1976 | title = Lekarze Chopina | url = | journal = Archiwum Historii Medycyny | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 305–32 }}</ref> or "nearly 50".<ref>E. Stocki (1956), ''"Zapomniani lekarze-przyjaciele Fryderyka Chopina"'', ''Polski Tygodnik Lekarski'', 24, pp. 1102-4 (1956). Cited from Sielużycki, 1976.</ref> In addition, the composer had friendly relations with other physicians, who may also have occasionally provided him with assistance.<ref name="sieluzycki" />

In [[Warsaw]], Chopin's physicians were Jan Fryderyk Wilhelm Malcz, Franciszek Girardot and Fryderyk Adolf Roemer. In [[Vienna]], Chopin was provided medical care by Johann Malfatti. Chopin's physicians in [[Paris]] included Aleksander Hofman, Jean-Jacques Molin, André François Cauviere, Jan Matuszyński, Adam Raciborski, Pierre Gaubert, Gustave Papet and Coste. During his 1848 stay in [[London]] &ndash; Mallan and James Clark. In Paris, in 1848–49, he was treated by Léon Simon, Fraenkel, David Koreff, Louis and Roth.<ref name="a" /> Chopin's last physician was [[Jean Cruveilhier]].

==Family history==
Little is known about the health of Frédéric’s father. [[Mikołaj Chopin]] lived to age 74 and suffered several times from [[respiratory infection]]s. The composer's mother had no chronic illness and reached the age of 87. 

Of Frédéric’s three sisters, Izabela died at age 70 and had no illnesses; [[Ludwika Jędrzejewicz|Ludwika]] suffered from recurrent respiratory infections and died at 47; the youngest, Emilia, was of frail health from earliest childhood. Emilia suffered from recurrent coughs and [[dyspnea]]; at 11 she began having [[hemorrhage]]s from the [[upper gastrointestinal tract]], and she died of a massive hemorrhage at 14.

==Hypotheses==
===Tuberculosis===
Chopin was diagnosed with tuberculosis and treated for it in accordance with contemporary practice, including [[bloodletting]] and [[purging]]. Tuberculosis figured in his death certificate, despite the alleged absence of typical organ changes. Critics of  alternative hypotheses about Chopin's disease point out the abundant evidence for tuberculosis.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cheng |first1=TO |title=Chopin's illness |journal=Chest |volume=114 |issue=2 |pages=654–5 |year=1998 |pmid=9726766 |doi=10.1378/chest.114.2.654-a}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1378/chest.114.2.655 |last1=Margolis |first1=ML |title=The long suffering of Frederic Chopin, revisited |journal=Chest |volume=114 |issue=2 |pages=655 |year=1998 |pmid=9726767}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1378/chest.114.2.655-a |last1=Carter |first1=ER |title=Chopin's malady |journal=Chest |volume=114 |issue=2 |pages=655–6 |year=1998 |pmid=9726768}}</ref> Chronic coughs and hemoptysis are common symptoms of tuberculosis; complications may include both [[pericarditis]], causing right-heart insufficiency, and [[bronchiectasis]], manifesting in productive cough and respiratory failure.

A 20-year history of [[hemoptysis]] is rare in tuberculosis, but not impossible.  Similarly, cavernous tuberculosis is rare in childhood, but cannot be excluded in the case of Emilia Chopin. Frédéric could have contracted tuberculosis from his younger sister.<ref>{{Cite book|first1=John M. |last1=O'Shea |title=Music & medicine: medical profiles of great composers |publisher=Dent |location=London |year=1990 |pages=142–3 |isbn=0-460-86106-9}}</ref> Against the diagnosis of tuberculosis stands the fact that some physicians who cared for Chopin did not diagnose him with that common, well-known disease. Another argument against tuberculosis would be the absence, in Cruveilhier’s report, of organ changes typical of tuberculosis, and gastrointestinal symptoms that cannot be explained by tuberculosis.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cheng |first1=T. O. |title=Chopin's Illness |journal=Chest |volume=114 |issue=2 |pages=654–5 |year=1998 |pmid=9726766 |doi=10.1378/chest.114.2.654-a}}</ref>

A monograph on historic methods of treating tuberculosis has discussed individual treatments on the example of Chopin, since his history well illustrates mid-19th-century views on treating tuberculosis.<ref>{{Cite book|first1=Esmond R. |last1=Long |year=1956 |title=A History of the Therapy of Tuberculosis and the Case of Frederic Chopin |publisher=[[University Press of Kansas]] |location=[[Lawrence, Kansas]] |pages= |oclc=14617261}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>

===Cystic fibrosis===
[[File:Cast of Chopin's hand.JPG|thumb|upright|Cast of Chopin's left hand]]
The hypothesis that Chopin suffered from [[cystic fibrosis]] was first presented by O’Shea in 1987.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=O'Shea |first1=JG |title=Was Frédéric Chopin's illness actually cystic fibrosis? |journal=The Medical journal of Australia |volume=147 |issue=11-12 |pages=586–9 |year=1987 |pmid=3320707}}</ref> It has been supported and popularized by physicians from the [[Poznan University of Medical Sciences|Medical University of Poznań]].<ref name="majka"/> Arguments for cystic fibrosis as the chief cause of Chopin’s complaints are: the onset of the condition in early childhood, possible familial occurrence (Emilia), gastrointestinal symptoms, intolerance of fat-rich meals, recurrent infections of the lower respiratory tract, also suppurative, with exacerbations in  winter, recurrent infections of the upper respiratory tract (laryngitis, sinusitis), barrel chest (visible in some photographs and caricatures), low tolerance of physical exercise, an episode of [[heatstroke]] (more frequent in cystic fibrosis), caries (more pronounced in this disease), putative [[infertility]].<ref>John O'Shea: Music & Medicine: Medical Profiles of Great Composers. London: Dent, 1990, p. 152. ISBN 0-460-86106-9</ref> 

There is no evidence for [[clubbed fingers]] &ndash; a symptom of [[hypertrophic osteoarthropathy]], frequent in cystic fibrosis &ndash; but hand and ankle [[arthralgia]] in his last year of life may relate to this condition.<ref>John O'Shea: Music & Medicine: Medical Profiles of Great Composers. London: Dent, 1990, p. 141. ISBN 0-460-86106-9</ref> It has been suggested that Chopin suffered from a mild form of cystic fibrosis, its course worsened by coexisting tuberculosis or another [[mycobacteriosis]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Persson |first1=H |last2=Wikman |first2=B |last3=Strandvik |first3=B |title=Frederic Chopin--the man, his music and his illness. |journal=Przeglad lekarski |volume=62 |issue=6 |pages=321–5 |year=2005 |pmid=16225061}}</ref> Confirmation for the [[cystic fibrosis]] hypothesis might be obtained by genetic testing of preserved body tissues, but so far scientists have not been granted permission to take samples from Chopin's heart, which is immured in a pillar inside Warsaw's [[Holy Cross Church, Warsaw|Holy Cross Church]].<ref>http://przekroj.pl/cywilizacja_nauka_artykul,6198,0.html</ref> A full review of the possible causes of Chopin's illness has recently been published.<ref>Lagerberg, Steven. "Chopin's Heart - The Quest to Identify the Mysterious Illness of the World's Most Beloved Composer." Lagerberg, 2011, ISBN 1-4564-0296-X.</ref>

Alfa 1-antitrypsin deficiency
A hypothesis of [[alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency]] was proposed by Kuzemko in 1994.<ref name="a" /> According to this hypothesis, Emilia's fatal hemorrhage was caused by [[Esophageal varices|ruptured esophageal varices]], secondary to [[liver cirrhosis]] in the course of alfa 1-antitrypsin deficiency. Frédéric's symptoms of liver insufficiency would be [[hypoproteinemia]], [[Feminization (biology)|feminization features]] (no facial hair) and [[gastrointestinal bleeding]]. His death would be explained by liver failure and respiratory failure due to [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].

Supporters of the [[cystic fibrosis|cystic-fibrosis]] hypothesis argue, against Kuzemko, that cystic fibrosis would explain Chopin’s symptoms equally well.<ref name="majka">{{Cite journal|last1=Majka |first1=L |last2=Goździk |first2=J |last3=Witt |first3=M |title=Cystic fibrosis--a probable cause of Frédéric Chopin's suffering and death |journal=Journal of applied genetics |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=77–84 |year=2003 |pmid=12590184}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Phelan |first1=PD |title=Chopin's illnesses |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=88 |issue=8 |pages=483–4 |year=1995 |pmid=7562840 |pmc=1295316}}</ref> Kuzemko himself has conceded that typical symptoms of [[liver cirrhosis]] in the course of alfa 1-antitripisin deficiency would be [[jaundice]] and [[ascites]].

Kuzemko’s hypothesis has been cited by Reuben<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Reuben |first1=A |title=Chopin's serpin |journal=Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.) |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=485–8 |year=2003 |pmid=12540812 |doi=10.1002/hep.510370244}}</ref> and Eriksson<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Eriksson |first1=S |title=Did Chopin suffer of antitrypsin deficiency? Lost autopsy protocol has caused frustration among physicians of our time in their attempts to confirm the diagnosis |journal=Lakartidningen |volume=100 |issue=30-31 |pages=2449–54 |year=2003 |pmid=12914142}}</ref> in 2003.

===Mitral stenosis===
[[Mitral stenosis]] is a possible, if unlikely, cause for the artist’s complaints and was discussed by Kubba and Young in 1998.<ref name="kubba">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1378/chest.113.1.210 |last1=Kubba |first1=AK |last2=Young |first2=M |title=The long suffering of Frederic Chopin |journal=Chest |volume=113 |issue=1 |pages=210–6 |year=1998 |pmid=9440592}}</ref> The most important argument against this hypothesis is the absence of evidence that Chopin suffered from [[rheumatic fever]] in childhood, which is the most common cause of [[mitral valve stenosis]].

===Other diseases===
Kubba and Young have pointed out a number of other conceivable, if unlikely, diagnoses, besides cystic fibrosis and alfa 1-antitripsin deficiency: [[Churg-Strauss syndrome]], [[allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis]], [[hypogammaglobulinemia]], [[idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis]], [[lung abscess]]es, and [[pulmonary]] [[arteriovenous malformation]]s.<ref name="kubba" />

===Infertility===
Chopin possibly was sexually active from early adulthood, but left no descendants. Some authors consider this evidence for [[infertility]], which would tend to strengthen the [[cystic fibrosis|cystic-fibrosis]] hypothesis.<ref name="majka" />

===Depression, etc.===
Chopin's biographers have often touched on the subject of depression, but the topic has rarely been broached by psychiatrists. One of the few studies of Chopin’s mental condition is a 1920 work by [[:pl:Bronislaw Onuf-Onufrowicz|Bronislaw Onuf-Onufrowicz]]. The author cited biographers concerning Chopin's character and psyche and pointed out some symptoms that might indicate a [[manic-depressive disorder]] (aka bipolar disorder) or [[dementia praecox]] (now termed [[schizophrenia]]), but he emphasized the absence of evidence for severe [[psychosis]] and the fact that single symptoms may only suggest a predisposition to such mental illnesses.<ref>{{Cite journal|first1=Bronislaw |last1=Onuf-Onufrowicz |authorlink1=Bronislaw Onuf-Onufrowicz |year=1920 |title=Frederick Chopin’s Mental Makeup |journal=Dementia Praecox Studies |volume=3 |issue=1–2 |pages=199–204 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=O4tXAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA199}}</ref>
