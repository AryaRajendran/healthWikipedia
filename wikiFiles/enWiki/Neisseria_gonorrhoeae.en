'''''Neisseria gonorrhoeae''''', also known as '''''gonococci''''' (plural), or '''''gonococcus''''' (singular), is a species of [[Gram-negative]] [[coffee bean]]-shaped [[diplococci]] [[bacteria]] responsible for the [[sexually transmitted infection]] [[gonorrhea]].<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}</ref>

''N. gonorrhoea'' was first described by [[Albert Ludwig Sigesmund Neisser|Albert Neisser]] in 1879.

== Microbiology ==

''[[Neisseria]]'' are [[fastidious]] Gram-negative cocci that require nutrient supplementation to grow in laboratory cultures. Specifically, they grow on [[chocolate agar]] with [[carbon dioxide]]. These cocci are facultatively intracellular and typically appear in pairs (diplococci), in the shape of coffee beans. Of the eleven species of ''Neisseria'' that colonize humans, only two are pathogens. ''N. gonorrhoeae'' is the causative agent of [[gonorrhea]] (also called "The Clap," which is derived from the French word "clapier," meaning "brothel") and is transmitted via [[Human sexual activity|sexual contact]].<ref name= GencoWetzler>{{cite book |author= Genco, C; Wetzler, L (editors)| year=2010 |title=Neisseria: Molecular Mechanisms of Pathogenesis | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-51-6}}</ref>

''Neisseria'' is usually isolated on [[Thayer-Martin agar]] (or VPN agar)—an [[agar plate]] containing [[antibiotic]]s ([[vancomycin]], [[colistin]], [[nystatin]], and [[Co-trimoxazole|TMP-SMX]]) and nutrients that facilitate the growth of ''Neisseria'' species while inhibiting the growth of contaminating bacteria and fungi. Further testing to differentiate the species includes testing for [[oxidase]] (all clinically relevant ''Neisseria'' show a positive reaction) and the [[carbohydrates]] [[maltose]], [[sucrose]], and [[glucose]] test in which ''N. gonorrhoeae'' will only oxidize (that is, utilize) the glucose.

''N. gonorrhoeae'' are motile (twitching motility) and possess [[type IV pilus|type IV pili]] to adhere to surfaces. The type IV pili operate mechanistically similar to a [[grappling hook]].  Pili extend and attach to a [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] which signals the pilus to retract, dragging the cell forward. ''N. gonorrhoeae'' are able to pull 100,000 times their own weight and it has been claimed that the [[Type IV pilus|pili]] used to do so are the strongest biological motor known to date, exerting one [[newton (unit)|nanonewton]].<ref name="newscientist">{{cite news|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19826525.300-mighty-microbe-pulls-100000-times-its-bodyweight.html|title=Mighty microbe pulls 100,000 times its bodyweight |date=19 April 2008 |publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=2009-07-01}}</ref>

''N. gonorrhoeae'' has surface proteins called Opa proteins, which bind to receptors on immune cells. In so doing, ''N. gonorrhoeae'' is able to prevent an immune response. The host is also unable to develop an immunological memory against ''N. gonorrhoeae'' – which means that future reinfection is possible. ''N. gonorrhoeae'' can also evade the immune system through a process called [[antigenic variation]], in which the ''N. gonorrhoeae'' bacterium is able to alter the antigenic determinants (sites where antibodies bind) such as the Opa proteins<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stern|first=Anne|coauthors=Brown, Nickel, Meyer|title=Opacity genes in Neisseria gonorrhoeae: Control of phase and antigenic variation|journal=Cell|date=10|year=1986|month=October|volume=47|issue=1|accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref>  and Type IV pili<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cahoon|first=Laty|coauthors=Seifert|title=Focusing homologous recombination: pilin antigenic variation in the pathogenic Neisseria|journal=Mol. Microbiol.|date=4|year=2011|month=August|volume=81|issue=5|pages=1136-1143|accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref>  that adorn its surface. The many permutations of surface proteins make it more difficult for immune cells to recognize ''N. gonorrhoeae'' and mount a defense.<ref>[http://blog.advocatesaz.org/2011/04/11/sti-awareness-gonorrhea/ STI Awareness: Gonorrhea].

''N. gonorrhoeae'' is naturally competent for DNA transformation as well as being capable of conjugation. Both of these concepts allow for the DNA of ''N. gonorrhoeae'' the ability to undergo conformational changes. Especially dangerous to the health industry is the ability to conjugate since this can lead to antibiotic resistance.

In 2011, researchers at Northwestern University found evidence of a human DNA fragment in a ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'' genome, the first example of [[horizontal gene transfer]] from humans to a bacterial pathogen.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110213174143.htm |date=13 February 2011 |accessdate=15 February 2011 |title=Gonorrhea Acquires a Piece of Human DNA: First Evidence of Gene Transfer from Human Host to Bacterial Pathogen |work=ScienceDaily.com}}</ref><ref name=anderson2011>{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Mark T.|coauthors=H.

== Disease ==
{{main|Gonorrhoea}}
Symptoms of infection with ''N. gonorrhoeae'' differ depending on the site of infection. Note also that 10% of infected males and 80% of infected females are asymptomatic. {{Citation needed|reason=change made to statistic-citation would help clarify|date=May 2011}}

Infection of the genitals can result in a purulent (or [[pus]]-like) discharge from the genitals which may be foul smelling.  Symptoms may include inflammation, redness, swelling, and [[dysuria]]

''N. gonorrhoeae'' can also cause [[conjunctivitis]], [[pharyngitis]], [[proctitis]] or [[urethritis]], [[prostatitis]] and [[orchitis]].

[[Conjunctivitis]] is common in [[neonates]] (newborns), and [[silver nitrate]] or [[antibiotics]] are often applied to their eyes as a preventive measure against gonorrhoea. Neonatal gonorrheal conjunctivitis is contracted when the infant is exposed to ''N. gonorrhoeae'' in the birth canal and can lead to corneal scarring or perforation, resulting in blindness in the neonate.

Disseminated ''N. gonorrhoeae'' infections can occur, resulting in [[endocarditis]], [[meningitis]] or gonococcal dermatitis-arthritis syndrome. Dermatitis-arthritis syndrome presents with [[arthralgia]], [[tenosynovitis]] and painless non-[[pruritic]] (non-itchy) [[dermatitis]].

Infection of the genitals in females with ''N. gonorrhoeae'' can result in [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] if left untreated, which can result in infertility. [[Pelvic inflammatory disease]] results if ''N. gonorrhoeae'' travels into the pelvic [[peritoneum]] (via the [[cervix]], [[endometrium]] and [[fallopian tubes]]). Infertility is caused by inflammation and scarring of the fallopian tube. Infertility is a risk to 10 to 20% of the females infected with ''N. gonorrhoeae''.

==Treatment and prevention==

If ''N. gonorrhoeae'' is [[Antibiotic resistance|resistant]] to the [[penicillin]] family of antibiotics, then [[ceftriaxone]] (a third-generation [[cephalosporin]]) is often used. Sexual partners should also be notified and treated.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15238613 | work=BBC News | title=UK doctors advised gonorrhoea has turned drug resistant | date=10 October 2011}}</ref>

Antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea has been noted by epidemiologists; beginning in the 1940s gonorrhea was treated with penicillin, but doses had to be continually increased in order to remain effective, and by the ’70s, penicillin- and tetracycline-resistant gonorrhea emerged in the Pacific Basin. These resistant strains then spread to Hawaii, California, the rest of the United States, and Europe. Fluoroquinolones were the next line of defense, but soon resistance to this antibiotic emerged as well. Since 2007, standard treatment has been third-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone, which are considered to be our “last line of defense.”<ref name="blog.advocatesaz.org">[http://blog.advocatesaz.org/2012/03/06/sti-awareness-antibiotic-resistant-gonorrhea STI Awareness: Antibiotic-Resistant Gonorrhea]. Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona. 6 March 2012. Retrieved 6 March 2012.</ref>

Recently, a high-level ceftriaxone-resistant strain of gonorrhea, called H041, was discovered in Japan. Lab tests found it to be resistant to high concentrations of ceftriaxone, as well as most of the other antibiotics tested. Within ''N. gonorrhoeae'', there are genes that confer resistance to every single antibiotic used to cure gonorrhea, but thus far they do not coexist within a single gonococcus. Because of ''N. gonorrhoeae''’s high affinity for horizontal gene transfer, however, antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea is seen as an emerging public health threat.<ref name="blog.advocatesaz.org"/>

Patients should also be tested for other [[sexually transmitted infections]], especially  ''[[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]]'' infections, since co-infection is frequent (up to 50% of cases). Antibacterial coverage is often included for Chlamydia because of this.

Transmission can be reduced by the usage of latex barriers, such as condoms or dental dams, during intercourse, oral and anal sex, and by limiting sexual partners.

===Vaccine===

Due to the relative frequency of infection and the emerging development of antibiotic resistance in strains of ''N. gonorrhoeae'', vaccines are thought to be an important goal in the prevention of infection.  However, there have been a relatively low emphasis on research to such a vaccine in the medical literature and few human clinical trials for prospective vaccines.  The ability to develop an effective vaccine has been limited by the lack of acquired immunity to infection to model a vaccine after and the current lack of commitment in effort and resources.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhu W, Chen CJ, Thomas CE, Anderson JE, Jerse AE, Sparling PF |title=Vaccines for gonorrhea: can we rise to the challenge? |journal=Front Microbiol |volume=2 |issue= |pages=124 |year=2011 |pmid=21687431 |pmc=3109613 |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2011.00124 |url=}}</ref>

==Survival of gonococci==	

The exudates from infected individuals contain many polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) with ingested ''gonococci''.  These ''gonococci'' stimulate the PMN to release an internal oxidative burst involving reactive oxygen species in order to kill the ''gonococci''.<ref>Simons MP, Nauseef WM, Apicella MA (2005). Interactions of Neisseria gonorrhoeae with adherent polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Infect Immun 73(4):1971-1977. PMID: 1578453</ref> However, a significant fraction of the ''gonococci'' can resist killing and are able to reproduce within the PMN phagosomes.  

Stohl and Seifert showed that the bacterial RecA protein, that mediates recombinational repair of DNA damage, plays an important role in ''gonococcal'' survival.<ref>Stohl EA, Seifert HS (2006). Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA recombination and repair enzymes protect against oxidative damage caused by hydrogen peroxide. J Bacteriol 188(21):7645-7651. PMID: 16936020</ref> The protection afforded by RecA protein may be linked to transformation, the process by which recipient ''gonococci'' take up DNA from neighboring ''gonococci'' and integrate this DNA into the recipient genome through recombination.  Michod et al. have suggested that an important benefit of transformation in ''N. gonorrhoeae'' may be recombinational repair of oxidative DNA damages caused by oxidative attack by the hosts phagocytic cells.<ref>Michod RE, Bernstein H, Nedelcu AM (2008). Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens. Infect Genet Evol 8(3):267-285. Review. PMID: 18295550  http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Faculty/Michod/Downloads/IGE%20review%20sex.pdf</ref>
