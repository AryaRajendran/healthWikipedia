In [[anatomy]], the '''orbit''' is the cavity or socket of the [[human skull|skull]] in which the [[human eye|eye]] and [[Accessory visual structures|its appendages]] are situated. "Orbit" can refer to the bony socket,<ref name="urlOrbit – Definition and More from the Free Merriam–Webster Dictionary">{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/orbit |title=Orbit – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> or it can also be used to imply the contents.<ref>{{MeshName|Orbit}}</ref> In the adult human, the volume of the orbit is 30&nbsp;ml, of which the eye occupies 6.5&nbsp;ml.<ref>Duane's Ophthalmology, Chapter 32 ''Embryology and Anatomy of the Orbit and Lacrimal System''. (eds Tasman W, Jaeger EA) Lippincott/Williams & Wilkins, 2007</ref>

==Definition==
The orbits are conical or four-sided pyramidal cavities, which open into the midline of the face and point back into the head. Each consists of a base, an apex and four walls.  They protect the eye from mechanical injury.<ref>"eye, human."Encyclopædia Britannica from [[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] 2009</ref>

The base, which opens in the face, has four borders. The following bones take part in their formation:
# Superior margin: [[frontal bone]]
# Inferior margin: [[maxilla]], [[palatine bone|palatine]] and [[zygomatic bone|zygomatic]]
# Medial margin: frontal, [[lacrimal bone|lacrimal]] and [[ethmoid]]
# Lateral margin: zygomatic and [[sphenoid]]

==Anatomy==
The apex lies near the medial end of [[superior orbital fissure]] and contains the [[optic canal]] (containing the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery), which communicates with [[middle cranial fossa]]. 

The roof (superior wall) is formed primarily by the orbital plate [[frontal bone]], and also the lesser wing of [[Sphenoid bone|sphenoid]] near the apex of the orbit. The orbital surface presents medially by trochlear fovea and laterally by lacrimal fossa.<ref name="Moore 2010">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Keith L.|title=Clinically Oriented Anatomy 6th Ed|year=2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-07817-7525-0}}</ref> 

The floor (inferior wall) is formed by the orbital surface of [[maxilla]], the orbital surface of [[zygomatic bone]] and the minute orbital process of [[palatine bone]]. Medially, near the orbital margin, is located the groove for [[nasolacrimal duct]]. Near the middle of the floor, located infraorbital groove, which leads to the infraorbital foramen. The floor is separated from the lateral wall by [[inferior orbital fissure]], which connects the orbit to [[Pterygopalatine fossa|pterygopalatine]] and [[infratemporal fossa]].

The medial wall is formed primarily by the orbital plate of [[ethmoid]], as well as contributions from the frontal process of maxilla, the [[lacrimal bone]], and a small part of the body of the sphenoid. It is the thinnest wall of the orbit, evidenced by pneumatized ethmoidal cells.<ref name="Moore 2010"/>

The lateral wall is formed by the frontal process of zygomatic and more posteriorly by the orbital plate of the greater wing of sphenoid. The bones meet at the zygomaticosphenoid suture. The lateral wall is the thickest wall of the orbit, important because it is the most exposed surface, highly vulnerable to blunt force trauma.

==Protrusion of the eye==
In the orbit, fat tissue, which surrounds the eyeball and its muscles, keeps the rotation smooth with respect to the center of the eye. If excess fat or other abnormal tissue is collected in the orbit, the eye may protrude, a condition known as [[exophthalmos]].<ref>"eye, human</ref>

[[Image:Tear system.svg|150px|right|thumb|'''Tear system''':<br>a. tear gland / lacrimal gland,<br>b. superior lacrimal punctum,<br>c. superior lacrimal canal,<br>d. tear sac / lacrimal sac,<br>e. inferior lacrimal punctum,<br>f. inferior lacrimal canal,<br>g. nasolacrimal canal]]Enlargement of the [[lacrimal gland]], located superotemporally within the orbit, produces protrusion of the eye inferiorly and medially (away from the location of the lacrimal gland). Lacrimal gland may be enlarged from [[inflammation]] (e.g. [[Sarcoidosis|sarcoid]]) or [[neoplasm]] (e.g. [[lymphoma]] or [[adenoid cystic carcinoma]]).<ref>Kumar V, Abbas AK, Fausto N. Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease. Seventh Edition. Philadephia: Elsevier Saunders, 2005, p. 1423.</ref> 

Tumors (e.g. [[glioma]] and [[meningioma]] of the [[optic nerve]]) within the cone formed by the horizontal rectus muscles produce axial protrusion (bulging forward) of the eye.

[[Graves disease]] may also cause axial protrusion of the eye, known as [[Graves' ophthalmopathy]], due to buildup of [[extracellular matrix]] [[protein]]s and [[fibrosis]] in the rectus muscles. Development of Graves' ophthalmopathy may be independent of thyroid function.<ref>Hatton MP, Rubin PA. The pathophysiology of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy. Ophthalmol Clin North Am 15:113–119, 2002.</ref>

* [[Lacrimal bone]]
* [[Ethmoid bone]] ([[Lamina papyracea]])
* [[Zygomatic bone]] ([[Orbital process of the zygomatic bone]])
* [[Maxillary bone]] ([[Orbital surface of the body of the maxilla]])
