A '''healthy diet''' is one that helps maintain or improve general [[health]]. It is thought to be important for lowering health risks, such as [[obesity]], [[heart disease]], [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]] and [[cancer]].<ref name=WHO123>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/fruit/en/index.html |title=WHO &#124; Promoting fruit and vegetable consumption around the world |work=WHO |accessdate=}}</ref> A healthy diet involves consuming primarily fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to satisfy caloric requirements, provide the body with [[essential nutrient]]s, [[phytochemical]]s, and [[fibre]], and provide adequate [[water]] intake. A healthy diet supports energy needs and provides for [[human nutrition]] without exposure to toxicity or excessive weight gain from consuming excessive amounts.

==Dietary recommendations==
{{main|List of nutrition guides}}
There are numerous diets and recommendations by medical and governmental institutions that promote health.

===World Health Organization===
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) makes the following 5 recommendations with respect to both populations and individuals:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/diet/en/index.html |title=WHO &#124; Diet |work=WHO |accessdate=}}</ref>
*Eat roughly the same amount of calories that your body is using. A healthy weight is a balance between energy consumed and energy that is 'burnt off'.
*Increase consumption of plant foods, particularly [[fruits]], [[vegetables]], [[legumes]], [[whole grains]] and [[nut (fruit)|nuts]].
*Limit intake of fats, namely [[saturated fats]] and [[trans fats]] and replace with healthier [[unsaturated fats]].
*Limit the intake of granulated [[sugar]]. A 2003 report recommends less than 10% simple sugars.<ref>{{cite web|title=WHO/FAO release independent Expert Report on diet and chronic disease |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr20/en/|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=21 February 2011}}</ref>
*Limit [[salt]] / [[sodium]] consumption from all sources and ensure that [[Iodised salt|salt is iodized]].

Other recommendations include:
*Essential micronutrients such as [[vitamins]] and certain minerals.
*Avoiding directly poisonous (e.g. heavy metals) and carcinogenic (e.g. [[benzene]]) substances.
*Avoiding foods contaminated by human [[pathogens]] (e.g. ''[[E. coli]]'', [[tapeworm]] eggs).

===American Heart Association / World Cancer Research Fund / American Institute for Cancer Research===
The American Heart Association, World Cancer Research Fund, and American Institute for Cancer Research recommends a diet that consists mostly of unprocessed plant foods, with emphasis a wide range of whole grains, legumes, and non-starchy vegetables and fruits. This healthy diet is replete with a wide range of various non-starchy vegetables and fruits, that provide different colors including red, green, yellow, white, purple, and orange. They note that tomato cooked with oil, allium vegetables like garlic, and cruciferous vegetables like cauliflower, provide some protection against cancer. This healthy diet is low in energy density, which may protect against weight gain and associated diseases. Finally, limiting consumption of sugary drinks, limiting energy rich foods, including “fast foods” and red meat, and avoiding processed meats improves health and longevity. Overall, researchers and medical policy conclude that this healthy diet can reduce the risk of chronic disease and cancer.<ref name="World Cancer Research Fund / American Institute for Cancer Research">{{cite web |url=http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/4841/1/4841.pdf |title=Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective |format= |work=Washington DC: AICR, 2007 |ISBN= 978-0-9722522-2-5 |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="urlwww.cancer.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cid/documents/webcontent/002577-pdf.pdf |title=American Cancer Society Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Prevention |format= |work=Last Revised: 1/11/2012 |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Harvard School of Public Health===
The Nutrition Source of [[Harvard School of Public Health]] makes the following 10 recommendations for a healthy diet:<ref name=nsm>{{cite web|title=What Should I Eat?|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/index.html|work=The Nutrition Source|publisher=Harvard School of Public Health|accessdate=17 October 2012}}</ref> 
*Choose good carbohydrates: whole grains (the less processed the better), vegetables, fruits and beans. Avoid white bread, white rice, and the like as well as pastries, sugared sodas, and other highly-processed food.<ref>http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/carbohydrates/index.html</ref>
*Pay attention to the protein package: good choices include fish, poultry, nuts, and beans. Try to avoid red meat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/index.html|title=The Bottom Line: Pay attention to the protein package. Fish, poultry, and beans are your best bets|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}</ref>
*Choose foods containing healthy fats. Plant oils, nuts, and fish are the best choices. Limit consumption of saturated fats, and avoid foods with trans fat.<ref name=nsm />
*Choose a [[fiber]]-filled diet which includes whole grains, vegetables, and fruits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fiber/index.html|title=The Bottom Line: Choose a fiber-filled diet, rich in whole grains, vegetables, and fruits|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}</ref>
*Eat more vegetables and fruits—the more colorful and varied, the better.<ref name=nsm />
*[[Calcium]] is important, but milk is not its best source. Good sources of calcium are collards, bok choy, fortified soy milk, baked beans, and supplements which contain calcium and vitamin D.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/calcium-and-milk/index.html|title=The Bottom Line: Calcium is important. But milk isn’t the only, or even best, source|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}</ref>
*[[Water]] is the best source of liquid. Avoid sugary drinks, and limit intake of juices and milk. Coffee, tea, artificially-sweetened drinks, 100-percent fruit juices, low-fat milk and alcohol can fit into a healthy diet but are best consumed in moderation. Sports drinks are recommended only for people who exercise more than an hour at a stretch to replace substances lost in sweat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-drinks/healthy-drinks-full-story/index.html|title=The Nutrition Source Healthy Beverage Guidelines|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}</ref> 
*Limit salt intake. Choose more fresh foods, instead of processed ones.<ref name=nsm />
*Moderate [[alcohol]] drinking has health benefits, but is not recommended for everyone.<ref name=nsm />
*Daily [[multivitamin]] and extra [[vitamin D]] intake has potential health benefits.<ref name=nsm />

Other than nutrition, the guide recommends frequent [[physical activity]] (exercise) and maintaining a healthy [[body weight]].<ref name=nsm />

==For specific conditions==
In addition to dietary recommendations for the general population, there are many specific diets that have primarily been developed to promote better health in specific population groups, such as people with [[high blood pressure]] (as in [[low sodium diet]]s or the more specific [[DASH diet]]), or people who are [[overweight]] or [[obesity|obese]] (in [[dieting|weight control diet]]s). However, some of them may have more or less evidence for beneficial effects in normal people as well.

===Hypertension===
A [[low sodium diet]] is beneficial for people with [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]. A [[Cochrane review]] published in 2008 concluded that a long term (more than 4 weeks) low sodium diet in [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] has a useful effect to reduce blood pressure, both in people with [[hypertension]] and in people with normal blood pressure.<ref name=cochrane2008>He FJ, MacGregor GA. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD004937/frame.html Effect of longer-term modest salt reduction on blood pressure.] Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2004, Issue 1. Art. No.: CD004937. {{doi|10.1002/14651858.CD004937}}.</ref> 

The [[DASH diet]] (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) is a [[dieting|diet]] promoted by the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]] (part of the [[NIH]], a United States government organization) to control [[hypertension]]. A major feature of the plan is limiting intake of [[sodium]],<ref name="dashguide">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/hbp/dash/new_dash.pdf|title=Your Guide To Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref> and it also generally encourages the consumption of nuts, whole grains, fish, poultry, fruits and vegetables while lowering the consumption of red meats, sweets, and sugar. It is also "rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium, as well as protein". Evidence shows that the [[Mediterranean diet]] improves cardiovascular outcomes.<ref name="Walker C, Reamy BV 2009 571–8">{{cite journal |author=Walker C, Reamy BV |title=Diets for cardiovascular disease prevention: what is the evidence? |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=79 |issue=7 |pages=571–8 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19378874 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Obesity===
{{Further|Dieting}}
[[Dieting|Weight control diets]] aim to maintain a controlled weight. In most cases dieting is used in combination with [[physical exercise]] to [[weight loss|lose weight]] in those who are [[overweight]] or [[obese]].

Diets to promote [[weight loss]] are generally divided into four categories: [[low-fat diet|low-fat]], [[low-carbohydrate diet|low-carbohydrate]], [[calorie restriction|low-calorie]], and [[very low calorie diet|very low calorie]].<ref name=Strychar>{{cite journal |author=Strychar I |title=Diet in the management of weight loss |journal=CMAJ |volume=174 |issue=1 |pages=56–63 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16389240 |pmc=1319349 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.045037 |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/174/1/56}}</ref> A [[meta-analysis]] of six randomized controlled trials found no difference between the main diet types (low calorie, low carbohydrate, and low fat), with a 2–4 kilogram weight loss in all studies.<ref name=Strychar/>  At two years, all calorie-reduced diet types cause equal weight loss irrespective of the macronutrients emphasized.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sacks FM, Bray GA, Carey VJ, ''et al.'' |title=Comparison of weight-loss diets with different compositions of fat, protein, and carbohydrates |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=360 |issue=9 |pages=859–73 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19246357 |pmc=2763382 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0804748}}</ref>

==Diet and possible reduced disease risk==
{{Further|Diet and cancer}}
There may be a relationship between lifestyle including food consumption and potentially lowering the risk of [[cancer]] or other [[chronic disease]]s. A healthy diet may consist mostly of whole plant foods, with limited consumption of [[energy-dense food]]s, [[red meat]], [[alcoholic drink]]s and [[salt]] while reducing consumption of [[sugary drink]]s, and [[processed meat]].<ref>{{cite book|title=EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Policy and Action for Cancer Prevention Food, Nutrition, and Physical Activity|year=2010|isbn=978-0-9722522-5-6|pages=1}}</ref> A healthy diet may contain non-starchy vegetables and fruits, including those with red, green, yellow, white, purple or orange [[pigment]]s. Tomato cooked with oil, [[allium]] vegetables like [[garlic]], and [[cruciferous]] vegetables like [[cauliflower]] "probably" contain compounds which are under research for their possible anti-cancer activity.<ref name="World Cancer Research Fund / American Institute for Cancer Research">{{cite web |url=http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/4841/1/4841.pdf |title=Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective |format= |work=Washington DC: AICR, 2007 |ISBN= 978-0-9722522-2-5 |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="urlwww.cancer.org"/> 

A healthy diet is low in energy density, lowering caloric content, thereby possibly inhibiting weight gain and lowering risk against chronic diseases.<ref name="World Cancer Research Fund / American Institute for Cancer Research">{{cite web |url=http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/4841/1/4841.pdf |title=Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective |format= |work=Washington DC: AICR, 2007 |isbn= 978-0-9722522-2-5 |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="urlwww.cancer.org"/><ref name="urlCancer Trends Progress Report - Fruit and Vegetable Consumption">{{cite web |url=http://progressreport.cancer.gov/doc_detail.asp?pid=1&did=2007&chid=71&coid=707&mid= |title=Cancer Trends Progress Report - Fruit and Vegetable Consumption |format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-14}}</ref>  Chronic Western diseases are associated with pathologically increased [[IGF-1]] levels.  Findings in molecular biology and epidemiologic data suggest that milk consumption is a promoter of chronic diseases of Western nations, including atherosclerosis, carcinogenesis and neurodegenerative diseases.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Melnik B.|title=Milk consumption: aggravating factor of acne and promoter of chronic diseases of Western societies.|journal=J Dtsch Dermatol Ges.|date=Apr 2009|pages=364-70|pmid=19243483|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19243483}}</ref>

==Unhealthy diets==
An unhealthy diet is a major risk factor for a number of chronic diseases including: [[high blood pressure]], [[diabetes]], abnormal blood lipids, [[overweight]]/[[obesity]], [[cardiovascular diseases]], and [[cancer]].<ref name=WHOD>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/en/ |title=WHO &#124; Diet and physical activity: a public health priority |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

The WHO estimates that 2.7 million deaths are attributable to a diet low in fruit and vegetable every year.<ref name=WHOD/>  Globally it is estimated to cause about 19% of [[gastrointestinal cancer]], 31% of [[ischaemic heart disease]], and 11% of [[strokes]],<ref name=WHO123/> thus making it one of the leading [[preventable causes of death]] worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lopez AD, Mathers CD, Ezzati M, Jamison DT, Murray CJ |title=Global and regional burden of disease and risk factors, 2001: systematic analysis of population health data |journal=Lancet |volume=367 |issue=9524 |pages=1747–57 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16731270 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68770-9 |url=}}</ref>

===Fad diets===
{{Main|Fad diet}}
''[[Fad]] diet'' usually refers to idiosyncratic diets and eating patterns. They are diets that claim to promote [[weight loss]] or treat [[obesity]] by various mechanisms,<ref name=Fad03>{{cite journal |author=Katz DL |title=Pandemic obesity and the contagion of nutritional nonsense |journal=Public Health Rev |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=33–44 |year=2003 |pmid=14656042 |doi= |url=}}</ref> provide little to no scientific reasoning behind their purported health benefits, and have little or no proof to support them.

== Public health ==
Fears of high [[cholesterol]] were frequently voiced up until the mid-1990s. However, more recent research has shown that the distinction between high- and low-density [[lipoprotein]] ('good' and 'bad' cholesterol, respectively) must be addressed when speaking of the potential ill effects of cholesterol. Different types of dietary fat have different effects on blood levels of cholesterol. For example, polyunsaturated fats tend to decrease both types of cholesterol; monounsaturated fats tend to lower LDL and raise HDL; saturated fats tend to either raise HDL, or raise both HDL and LDL;<ref name=Mensink2003>{{cite journal | title = Effects of dietary fatty acids and carbohydrates on the ratio of serum total to HDL cholesterol and on serum lipids and apolipoproteins: a meta-analysis of 60 controlled trials | url=http://www.ajcn.org/content/77/5/1146.full?ijkey=846a72387ebc0d82545acd5442a0c3a9e9fc3566 | journal =American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | author = Mensink RP, Zock PL, Kester ADM, Katan MB | volume=77 | issue=5  | pages = 1146–1155 | month = May | year = 2003 | issn = 0002-9165|pmid=12716665}}</ref><ref name=Thijssen>Thijssen, M.A. and R.P.

''Atherosclerosis: Diet and Drugs''. Springer. pp. 171–172. ISBN 978-3-540-22569-0.</ref> and trans fat tend to raise LDL and lower HDL. Dietary cholesterol itself is only found in animal products such as meat, eggs, and dairy, but studies have shown that even large amounts of dietary cholesterol only have negligible effects on blood cholesterol.<ref name=Fernandez2010>{{cite journal | title = Revisiting dietary cholesterol recommendations: does the evidence support a limit of 300 mg/d? | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/0ml5027045n1k473 | journal = Current Atherosclerosis Reports | author = Fernandez ML, Calle M | volume=12 | issue=6  | pages = 377–383 | month = November | year = 2010}}</ref> 

[[Vending machine]]s in particular have come under fire as being avenues of entry into schools for [[junk food]] promoters. However, there is little in the way of regulation and it is difficult for most people to properly analyze the real merits of a company referring to itself as "healthy." Recently, the United Kingdom removed the rights for [[McDonald's]] to advertise its products, as the majority of the foods that were seen have low nutrient values and high fat counts were aimed at children under the guise of the "Happy Meal"{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. The [[British Heart Foundation]] released its own government-funded advertisements, labeled "[http://food4thought.bhf.org.uk/ Food4Thought]", which were targeted at children and adults displaying the gory nature of how fast food is generally constituted.

== Cultural and psychological factors ==
From a psychological and cultural perspective, a healthier diet may be difficult to achieve for people with poor eating habits.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/25/health/policy/25vegetables.html "Told to Eat Its Vegetables, America Orders Fries"] article by Kim Severson in ''[[The New York Times]]'' September 24, 2010, accessed September 25, 2010</ref> This may be due to tastes acquired in childhood and preferences for sugary, salty and/or fatty foods.<ref>{{cite journal |author=James WP |journal=Obesity Research |issue=Mar;9 Suppl 1:6-13 |title=The fundamental drivers of the obesity epidemic |year=2008 |pmid=18307693 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2007.00432.x |volume=9 Suppl 1 |pages=6–13}}</ref>
