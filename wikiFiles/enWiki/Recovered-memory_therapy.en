'''Recovered-memory therapy''' (RMT) is catch-all [[psychotherapy]] term for therapy using one or more method or technique for the purpose of recalling memories.<ref name="lief">

Proponents of recovered memory therapy claim that traumatic memories can be buried in the subconscious and affect current behavior, and that these can be recovered.

Studies by [[Elizabeth Loftus]] and others have concluded that it is possible to produce false memories of childhood incidents.<ref name=Loftus>{{cite journal | last = Loftus | first = E | coauthors = Davis D | year = 2006 | title = Recovered Memories | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 2 | pages = 469–98 | url = https://webfiles.uci.edu/eloftus/LoftusDavisAnnualReview06.pdf?uniq=-qcmbr3 | accessdate = 2008-05-16 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095315 | pmid = 17716079}}</ref> The experiments involved manipulating subjects into believing that they had some fictitious experience in childhood, such as being lost in a shopping mall at age 6. This involved using a suggestive technique called "familial informant false narrative procedure," in which the experimenter claims the validity of the false event is supported by a family member of the subject. The study has been used to support the theory that false memories of traumatic sexual abuse can be implanted in a patient by therapists.   Critics of these studies argue that the techniques do not resemble any approved or mainstream treatment modality,<ref name=KSPope/> and there are criticisms that the implanted events used are not emotionally comparable to sexual abuse.<ref name=Williams>{{cite journal |author=Williams LM | title = Recall of childhood trauma: a prospective study of women's memories of child sexual abuse |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=62 |issue=6 |pages=1167–76 |year=1994 |month=December |pmid=7860814 |doi= 10.1037/0022-006X.62.6.1167|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/ccp/62/6/1167}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Rogers, Richard | title = Clinical Assessment of Malingering and Deception, Third Edition |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=1-59385-699-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Critics{{who|date=November 2012}} contend that Loftus's conclusions overreach the evidence.<ref name=Williams/><ref name=KSPope>{{cite journal |url=http://kspope.com/memory/repweb2a.php |last=Pope |first=KS | title = Pseudoscience, Cross-examination, and Scientific Evidence in the Recovered Memory Controversy |volume= 4| issue = #4 |pages=1160–1181 |journal=Psychology, Public Policy, and Law |publisher=American Psychological Association |doi=10.1037/1076-8971.4.4.1160 |year=1998}}</ref>

Some patients later retract memories they had previously believed to be recovered. While false or contrived memories are possible reasons for such retractions, other explanations{{by whom?|date=November 2012}} suggested for the retraction of allegations of abuse made by children and adults include guilt, a feeling of obligation to protect their family and a reaction to familial stress rather than a genuine belief that their memories are false.<ref name="Summit">{{cite journal |last= Summit |first= R. |year= 1983 |month= | title = The child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome. |journal= Child Abuse & Neglect |volume=7 |issue= 2|pages=177–193|doi= 10.1016/0145-2134(83)90070-4 }}</ref> The number of retractions is reported{{by whom?|date=November 2012}} to be small compared to the actual number of child sexual abuse allegations made based on recovered memories.<ref name=Whitfield/>

A study at the Dissociative Disorders and Trauma Program of the McLean Hospital concluded that recovered memories are mostly unconnected to [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic treatment]] and that memories are often corroborated by independent evidence, often appearing while home or with family and friends, with suggestion being generally denied as a factor in recovering memories.<ref name=chu>{{cite journal |last=Chu |first=J |coauthors= Frey L, Ganzel B, Matthews J |year=1999 |month=May | title = Memories of childhood abuse: dissociation, amnesia, and corroboration. |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=156 |issue=5 |pages=749–55 |pmid = 10327909|accessdate= 2008-01-16}}</ref> Very few participants were in therapy during their first memory recovery and a majority of participants in this study found strong corroboration of their recovered memories.<ref name=chu/>

== Professional guidelines ==
There are several individuals and groups that have published guidelines, criticisms or cautions about recovered memory therapy and techniques to stimulate recall:
* In the ''Brandon Report'', a set of training, practice, research and professional development recommendations, the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] advised psychiatrists to avoid use of RMT or any "memory recovery techniques", citing a lack of evidence to support the accuracy of memories recovered in this way.<ref name=Brandon1997>{{cite journal | author = Brandon, S. | coauthors = Boakes, J.; Glaser, D.; Green, R.; MacKeith, J.; Whewell, P. | year = 1997 | title = Reported recovered memories of child sexual abuse: Recommendations for good practice and implications for training, continuing professional development and research | journal = Psychiatric Bulletin | volume = 21 | issue = 10 | pages = 663–665 | doi = 10.1192/pb.21.10.663}}</ref>
* In 2004, the government of the Health Council of the Netherlands issued a report in response to inquiries from professionals regarding RMT and memories of traumatic child sexual abuse.<ref name="HC" /> The Health Council stated that while traumatic childhood experiences were major risk factors for psychological problems in adulthood, most traumatic memories are well remembered but can be forgotten or become inaccessible though the influence of specific circumstances precludes a simple description of the relationship between memory and trauma. The report also notes that memories can be [[confabulation|confabulated]], re-interpreted and even apparently vivid or dramatic memories can be false, a risk that is increased when therapists use suggestive techniques, attempt to link symptoms to past trauma, with certain patients and through the use of methods to stimulate memories.<ref name="HC" />
* The Australian Hypnotherapists Association (AHA) issued a similar statement, for contexts where false memories of child sexual abuse may arise. The AHA acknowledges that child sexual abuse is serious, damaging and at least some memories are genuine, while cautioning that some questioning techniques and interventions may lead to illusory memories leading to false beliefs about abuse.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ahahypnotherapy.org.au/downloads/AHA%20Code%20of%20Ethics.pdf | title = Australian Hypnotherapists Association Code of Ethics: Guidelines for AHA Members working with clients in contexts in which issues related to false memories of childhood sexual abuse may arise | publisher = Australian Hypnotherapists Association | accessdate = 2008-05-16 | format = PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070830083446/http://www.ahahypnotherapy.org.au/downloads/AHA+Code+of+Ethics.pdf |archivedate = August 30, 2007}}</ref>
* The [[Canadian Psychological Association]] has issued guidelines for psychologists addressing recovered memories.<ref>{{cite book | url = http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/publications/Recovered%20memory.pdf | format = PDF | year = 1996 | isbn = 1-896538-38-X | last = Ogloff | first = JRP | publisher = [[Canadian Psychological Association]] | title = Guidelines for psychologists addressing recovered memories |accessdate = 2008-05-16 }}</ref> Psychologists are urged to be aware of their limitations in knowledge and training regarding memory, trauma and development and "that there is no constellation of symptoms which is diagnostic of child sexual abuse". The guidelines also urge caution and awareness of the benefits and limitations of "relaxation, hypnosis, guided imagery, free associations, inner child exercises, age regression, body memory interpretation, body massage, dream interpretation, and the use of projective techniques" and special caution regarding any legal involvement of memories, abuse and therapy.

Discussing RMT in parliament in 1995, an Australian state Minister for Health, Dr Andrew Refshauge – a former medical practitioner – stated that the general issue of admissibility of evidence based on recovered memories was one for the Attorney General.<ref name="parliament.nsw.gov.au" /> In 2004 Australian Counseling Association issued a draft position statement regarding recovered memories in which they informed their membership of possible legal difficulties if they affirm accusations as true based solely upon discussion of a patient's recovered memories without adequate corroborating evidence.<ref name="aca_newsletter" />

A degree of controversy does remain within legal circles, with some holding the view that therapists and courts should consider repressed memories the same as they consider regular memories.

Implanted memories of [[incest]] is one of two central [[story arc]]s in [[Robert J. Sawyer]]'s 1998 [[science fiction]] novel ''Factoring Humanity''. 

One episode of ''[[Law & Order:  Special Victims Unit]]'' focused on a victim of recovered-memory therapy who falsely accused her father and then murdered him when he got out on bail.  The girl was put in the hospital and the psychiatrist was arrested for causing the man's death.
