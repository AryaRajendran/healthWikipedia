The '''sulfur mustards''', or '''sulphur mustards''',<ref>[http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/suppl7/mustardgas.html Mustard Gas (Sulphur Mustard) (IARC Summary & Evaluation, Supplement7, 1987)]. Inchem.org (1998-02-09). Retrieved on 2011-05-29.</ref> commonly known as '''mustard gas''', are a class of related [[cytotoxic]] and [[Blister agent|vesicant]] [[chemical warfare agent]]s with the ability to form large [[blister]]s on the exposed skin and in the lungs. Pure sulfur mustards are colorless, viscous liquids at room temperature. When used in impure form, such as warfare agents, they are usually [[tawny (color)|yellow-brown]] in color and have an odor resembling [[mustard plant]]s, [[garlic]] or [[horseradish]], hence the name. Mustard gas was originally assigned the name ''LOST'', after the scientists [[Wilhelm Lommel]] and [[Wilhelm Steinkopf]], who developed a method for the large-scale production of mustard gas for the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]] in 1916.<ref>{{cite book

Mustard agents are regulated under the 1993 [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] (CWC). Three classes of chemicals are monitored under this Convention, with sulfur and nitrogen mustard grouped in [[List of Schedule 1 substances (CWC)|Schedule 1]], as substances with no use other than in [[chemical warfare]]. Mustard agents could be deployed on the battlefield by means of [[artillery shell]]s, [[aerial bomb]]s, [[rocket]]s, or by spraying from [[warplane]]s.

==Synthesis==
Sulfur mustard is the [[organic compound]] with [[chemical formula|formula]] (Cl-CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S. In the Depretz method, sulfur mustard is synthesized by treating [[sulfur dichloride]] with [[ethylene]]:
:SCl<sub>2</sub> + 2 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> → (Cl-CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S
In the Levinstein process, [[disulfur dichloride|sulfur monochloride]] is used instead:<ref name="Stewart, Charles D. 2006 47">{{Cite book|author=Stewart, Charles D. |title=Weapons of mass casualties and terrorism response handbook |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |location=Boston |year=2006 |page=47 |isbn=0-7637-2425-4 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=7ZnXZfwWwgcC&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=levinstein+inventor+mustard}}</ref><ref name="Federation of American Scientists">{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/bio/chemweapons/production.html |title=Chemical Weapons Production and Storage |publisher=Federation of American Scientists}}</ref>
:8 S<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> + 16 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> → 8 (Cl-CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S + S<sub>8</sub>
In the Meyer method, [[thiodiglycol]] is produced from [[chloroethanol]] and [[potassium sulfide]] and chlorinated with [[phosphorus trichloride]]:<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2058&page=71|title=Chapter 5: Chemistry of Sulfur Mustard and Lewisite|author=Institute of Medicine |year=1993 |work=Veterans at Risk: The Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite |publisher=The National Academies Press |isbn=0-309-04832-X}}</ref>
:3 (HO-CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S + 2 PCl<sub>3</sub> → 3 (Cl-CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S + 2 P(OH)<sub>3</sub>
In the Meyer-Clarke method, concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) instead of PCl<sub>3</sub> is used as the chlorinating agent:
:(HO-CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S + 2 HCl → (Cl-CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O
[[Thionyl chloride]] and [[phosgene]] have also been used as chlorinating agents.

It is a viscous liquid at normal temperatures. The pure compound has a melting point of 14&nbsp;°C (57&nbsp;°F) and decomposes before boiling at 218&nbsp;°C (424.4&nbsp;°F).

==Mechanism of toxicity==
The compound readily eliminates a [[chloride]] ion by intramolecular [[nucleophilic substitution]] to form a cyclic [[sulfonium]] ion. This very reactive intermediate tends to permanently [[Alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylate]] the [[guanine]] [[nucleotide]] in [[DNA]] strands, which prevents cellular division and generally leads directly to [[apoptosis|programmed cell death]],<ref name="opcw.org">[http://www.opcw.org/about-chemical-weapons/types-of-chemical-agent/mustard-agents/ Mustard agents: description, physical and chemical properties, mechanism of action, symptoms, antidotes and methods of treatment]. Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Accessed June 8, 2010.</ref> or, if cell death is not immediate, the damaged DNA may lead to the development of cancer.<ref name="opcw.org" /> Sulfur mustard is not very soluble in water but is very soluble in fat, contributing to its rapid absorption into the skin.<ref name="opcw.org" />

:[[Image:Mustard-dna.png|400px]]

In the wider sense, compounds with the structural element BCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>X, where ''X'' is any [[leaving group]] and ''B'' is a [[Lewis base]] are known as ''mustards''. Such compounds can form cyclic "onium" ions (sulfonium, [[ammonium]]s, etc.) that are good [[alkylating agent]]s. Examples are bis(2-chloroethyl)ether, the (2-haloethyl)amines ([[nitrogen mustard]]s), and sulfur sesquimustard, which has two α-chloroethyl thioether groups (ClH<sub>2</sub>C-CH<sub>2</sub>-S-) connected by an ethylene (-CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>-) group.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} These compounds have a similar ability to alkylate DNA, but their physical properties, e.g. melting point, vary.

==Physiological effects==
[[Image:mustard gas burns.jpg|thumb||left|Soldier with moderate mustard gas burns sustained during [[World War I]] showing characteristic [[Bulla (dermatology)|bullae]] on neck, armpit and hands]]

Mustard gas has extremely powerful [[vesicant]] effects on its victims. In addition, it is strongly [[mutagen]]ic and [[carcinogen]]ic, due to its alkylating properties. It is also [[lipophilic]]. Because people exposed to mustard gas rarely suffer immediate symptoms, and mustard-contaminated areas may appear completely normal, victims can unknowingly receive high dosages. Within 24 hours of exposure to mustard agent, victims experience intense itching and skin irritation, which gradually turns into large blisters filled with yellow fluid wherever the mustard agent contacted the skin. These are [[chemical burn]]s and are very debilitating. Mustard gas vapour easily penetrates clothing fabrics such as wool or cotton, so it is not only the exposed skin of victims that gets burned. If the victim's eyes were exposed then they become sore, starting with [[conjunctivitis]], after which the eyelids swell, resulting in temporary blindness. [[Miosis]] may also occur, which is probably the result from the cholinomimetic activity of mustard.<ref>[http://www.brooksidepress.org/Products/OperationalMedicine/DATA/operationalmed/Manuals/RedHandbook/004Vesicants.htm Vesicants]. brooksidepress.org</ref> At very high concentrations, if inhaled, mustard agent causes bleeding and blistering within the [[respiratory system]], damaging [[mucous membrane]]s and causing [[pulmonary edema]]. Depending on the level of contamination, mustard gas burns can vary between [[first degree burn|first]] and [[second degree burn]]s, though they can also be every bit as severe, disfiguring and dangerous as [[third degree burn]]s.<ref>[http://www.vlib.us/wwi/resources/archives/images/i040823a/key.html Effects of mustard gas, WW1|Gas Warfare Medical Aspects|World War II Resource Centre]. Vlib.us (2004-08-23). Retrieved on 2011-05-29.</ref> Severe mustard gas burns (i.e. where more than 50% of the victim's skin has been burned) are often fatal, with death occurring after some days or even weeks have passed. Mild or moderate exposure to mustard agent is unlikely to kill, though victims require lengthy periods of medical treatment and [[convalescence]] before recovery is complete. The [[mutagenic]] and [[carcinogenic]] effects of mustard agent mean that victims who recover from mustard gas burns have an increased risk of developing [[cancer]] in later life.

[[Image:blister-arm.jpg|right|thumb|Typical appearance of [[Bulla (dermatology)|bullae]] on arm caused by [[blister agent]] burns]]
Skin damage can be reduced if [[povidone-iodine]], ([[Betadine]]), in a base of [[glycofurol]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB0756949.htm |title=GLYCOFUROL&#124;9004-76-6 |publisher= chemicalbook.com |accessdate=May 29, 2011}}</ref> is rapidly applied, but since mustard agent initially has no symptoms, exposure is usually not recognised until skin irritation begins, at which point it is too late for countermeasures. The vesicant property of mustard gas can be neutralised by [[oxidation]] or [[halogenation|chlorination]], using household bleach ([[sodium hypochlorite]]), or by nucleophilic attack using e.g. decontamination solution "DS2" (2% [[sodium hydroxide|NaOH]], 70% [[diethylenetriamine]], 28% [[ethylene glycol monomethyl ether]]). After initial decontamination of the victim's wounds is complete, medical treatment is similar to that required by any conventional burn. The amount of pain and discomfort suffered by the victim is comparable as well. Mustard gas burns heal slowly, and, as with other types of burn, there is a risk of [[sepsis]] caused by [[pathogen]]s such as [[Staphylococcus aureus]] and [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]].

A British nurse treating soldiers with mustard gas burns during [[World War I]] commented:

{{Quote|They cannot be bandaged or touched. We cover them with a tent of propped-up sheets. Gas burns must be agonizing because usually the other cases do not complain, even with the worst wounds, but gas cases are invariably beyond endurance and they cannot help crying out.}}<ref>{{cite book|author=Van Bergen, Leo |title=Before My Helpless Sight: Suffering, Dying and Military Medicine on the Western Front, 1914–1918|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qR-mzZkvaMoC&pg=PA184|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-5853-5|page=184}}</ref>

==Formulations==
In its history, various types and mixtures of sulfur mustard have been employed. These include:

* '''H'''&nbsp;– Also known as '''HS''' ("Hun Stuff") or ''Levinstein mustard''. This is named after the inventor of the quick but dirty '''Levinstein Process''' for manufacture,<ref name="Stewart, Charles D. 2006 47"/><ref name="Federation of American Scientists"/> reacting dry [[ethylene]] with [[disulfur dichloride|sulfur monochloride]] under controlled conditions. Undistilled sulfur mustard contains 20–30% impurities, for which reason it does not store as well as '''HD'''. Also, as it decomposes, it increases in [[vapor pressure]], making the munition it is contained in likely to split, especially along a seam, releasing the agent to the atmosphere<ref name="FM 3-8" />

* '''HD'''&nbsp;– Codenamed '''Pyro''' by the British, and '''Distilled Mustard''' by the US.<ref name="FM 3-8" /> [[distillation|Distilled]] sulfur mustard (bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide); approximately 96% pure. The term "mustard gas" usually refers to this variety of sulfur mustard. A much-used path of synthesis was based upon the reaction of [[thiodiglycol]] with [[hydrochloric acid]].
* '''HT'''&nbsp;– Codenamed '''Runcol''' by the British, and '''Mustard T- mixture''' by the US.<ref name="FM 3-8" /> A mixture of 60% sulfur mustard (HD) and 40% T (bis[2-(2-chloroethylthio)ethyl] ether), a related vesicant with lower [[freezing point]], lower [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] and similar vesicant characteristics.
* '''HL'''&nbsp;– A blend of distilled mustard (HD) and [[Lewisite]] (L), originally intended for use in winter conditions due to its lower freezing point compared to the pure substances. The Lewisite component of HL was used as a form of [[antifreeze]].<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/EmergencyResponseCard_29750007.html The Emergency Response Safety and Health Database: MUSTARD-LEWISITE MIXTURE (HL)].

==History==

===Development===
Mustard gas was possibly developed as early as 1822 by [[César-Mansuète Despretz]] (1798–1863).<ref name="mustardgas">[http://itech.dickinson.edu/chemistry/?p=408 By Any Other Name: Origins of Mustard Gas]. Itech.dickinson.edu (2008-04-25). Retrieved on 2011-05-29.</ref> Despretz described the reaction of [[sulfur dichloride]] and [[ethylene]] but never made mention of any irritating properties of the reaction product, which makes the claim doubtful. In 1854, another French chemist, Alfred Riche (1829–1908), repeated this procedure but he did not describe any adverse physiological properties. In 1860, the British scientist [[Frederick Guthrie]] synthesized and characterized the mustard gas compound, and he also noted its irritating properties, especially in tasting.<ref name="Guthrie">{{cite journal |author=F. Guthrie |title=XIII.—On some derivatives from the olefines |journal=Q. J. Chem. Soc. |volume=12 |pages=109–126 |year=1860 |doi=10.1039/QJ8601200109 |issue=1 }}</ref> In 1860, chemist [[Albert Niemann (chemist)|Albert Niemann]], known as a pioneer in [[cocaine]] chemistry, repeated the reaction, and recorded blister-forming properties. In 1886, [[Viktor Meyer]] published a paper describing a synthesis that produced good yields. He combined [[2-Chloroethanol|2-chloroethanol]] with [[aqueous]] [[potassium sulfide]], and then treated the resulting [[thiodiglycol]] with [[phosphorus trichloride]]. The purity of this compound was much higher, and so were the adverse health effects on exposure much more severe. These symptoms presented themselves in his assistant, and in order to rule out the possibility that his assistant was suffering from a mental illness (psychosomatic symptoms), Meyer had this compound tested on laboratory [[rabbit]]s, most of which died. In 1913, the English chemist [[Hans Thacher Clarke]] (known for the [[Eschweiler-Clarke reaction]]) replaced the phosphorus trichloride with [[hydrochloric acid]] in Meyer's formulation while working with [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] in [[Berlin]]. Clarke was hospitalized for two months for burns after one of his flasks broke. According to Meyer, Fischer's report on this accident to the [[German Chemical Society]] sent the [[German Empire]] on the road to chemical weapons.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Duchovic, Ronald J.; Vilensky, Joel A. |title=Mustard Gas: Its Pre-World War I History |journal=J.

Mustard gas can have the effect of turning a patient's skin different colors, including reds, oranges, pinks, and in unusual cases, blues.</ref> The [[German Empire]] during [[World War I]] relied on the Meyer-Clarke method with the [[2-Chloroethanol|2-chloroethanol]] chemical structure already available from the German [[chemical industry|chemical dye industry]] of that time.

===Use===
[[Image:155mmMustardGasShells.jpg|thumb|Pallets of 155 mm [[artillery shell]]s containing "HD" (distilled sulfur mustard agent) at [[Pueblo Chemical Depot|Pueblo chemical weapons storage facility]]. The distinctive [[Bottled gas#Colour coding|color-coding]] scheme on each shell is visible]]
Mustard gas was first [[use of poison gas in World War I|used effectively in World War I]] by the German army against British soldiers near [[Ypres]], [[Belgium]], in 1917 and later also against the [[French Second Army]]. The name '''''Yperite''''' comes from its usage by the German army near the town of Ypres. The Allies did not use mustard gas until November 1917 at [[Cambrai]], France, after the armies had captured a stockpile of German mustard-gas shells. It took the British more than a year to develop their own mustard gas weapon. (The only option available to the British was the Despretz–Niemann–Guthrie process). This was used first in September 1918 during the breaking of the [[Hindenburg Line]].

Mustard gas was dispersed as an [[particulate|aerosol]] in a mixture with other chemicals, giving it a yellow-brown color and a distinctive odor. Mustard gas has also been dispersed in such munitions as [[aerial bomb]]s, [[land mine]]s, [[mortar (weapon)|mortar rounds]], [[artillery shell]]s, and [[rocket]]s.<ref name="FM 3-8" /> Exposure to mustard gas was lethal in about one percent of cases. Its effectiveness was as an [[incapacitating agent]]. The early countermeasures against mustard gas were relatively ineffective, since a soldier wearing a [[gas mask]] was not protected against absorbing it through his skin and being blistered.

Mustard gas is a persistent weapon that remains on the ground for days and weeks, and it continues to cause ill effects. If mustard gas contaminates a soldier's clothing and equipment, then the other soldiers that he comes into contact with are also poisoned. Towards the end of World War I, mustard gas was used in high concentrations as an [[area denial weapons|area-denial weapon]] that forced troops to abandon heavily-contaminated areas.

The results of this study were not published until 1946, when they were declassified.<ref name="gilman" /> In a parallel track, after the [[air raid on Bari]] in December 1943, the doctors of the U.S. Army noted that white blood cell counts were reduced in their patients. Some years after World War II was over, the incident in Bari and the work of the Yale University group with nitrogen mustard converged, and this prompted a search for other similar [[chemical compound]]s. Due to its use in previous studies, the nitrogen mustard called  "HN2" became the first cancer [[chemotherapy]] drug, [[mustine]], to be used.

====Disposal====
Most of the sulfur mustard gas found in [[Nazi Germany]] after [[World War II]] was dumped into the [[Baltic Sea]]. Between 1966 and 2002, fishermen have found about 700 chemical weapons in the region of [[Bornholm]], most of which contain sulfur mustard. One of the more frequently-dumped weapons was the "Sprühbüchse 37" (SprüBü37, Spray Can 37, 1937 being the year of its fielding with the German Army). These weapons contain sulfur mustard mixed with a [[thickener]], which gives it a tar-like viscosity. When the content of the SprüBü37 comes in contact with water, only the sulfur mustard in the outer layers of the lumps of viscous mustard [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzes]], leaving behind amber-colored residues that still contain most of the active sulfur mustard. On mechanically breaking these lumps, e.g., with the drag board of a fishing net or by the human hand, the enclosed sulfur mustard is still as active as it had been at the time the weapon was dumped. These lumps, when washed ashore, can be mistaken for amber, which can lead to severe health problems. [[shell (projectile)|Artillery shells]] containing sulfur mustard and other toxic ammunition from World War I (as well as conventional explosives) can still be found in France and Belgium. These were formerly disposed of by explosion undersea, but since the current environmental regulations prohibit this, the [[French government]] is building an automated factory to dispose of the accumulation of chemical shells.

In 1972, the [[U.S. Congress]] banned the practice of disposing of chemical weapons into the ocean by the United States. 64 million pounds of nerve and mustard agents had already been dumped into the ocean off the United States by the [[U.S. Army]]. According to a report created in 1998 by William Brankowitz, a deputy project manager in the [[U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency]], the Army created at least 26 chemical weapons dumping sites in the ocean offshore from at least 11 states on both the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] (in [[Operation CHASE]], [[Operation Geranium]], etc.). In addition, due to poor recordkeeping, about one-half of the sites have only their rough locations known.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bull|first=John|title=The Deadliness Below|url=http://articles.dailypress.com/2005-10-30/news/0510300001_1_chemical-weapons-army-chemical-materials-agency-mustard-gas|publisher=Daily Press Virginia|date=2005-10-30}}</ref>

A significant portion of the [[stockpile (military)|stockpile]] of mustard agent in the United States was stored at the Edgewood Area of [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] in [[Maryland]]. Approximately 1,621 tons of mustard agent were stored in one-ton containers on the base under heavy guard. An incineration plant built on the Proving Ground neutralized the last of this stockpile in February 2005. This stockpile had priority because of the potential for quick reduction of risk to the community. The nearest schools were fitted with overpressurization machinery to protect the students and faculty in the event of a catastrophic explosion and fire at the site. These projects, as well as planning, equipment, and training assistance, were provided to the surrounding community as a part of the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program (CSEPP), a joint program of the Army and the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/government/grant/csepp1.shtm |title=CSEPP Background Information |publisher=US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) |date=02-May-2006 }}</ref> Unexploded shells containing mustard agent and other chemical agents are still present in several test ranges in proximity to schools in the Edgewood area, but the smaller amounts of poison gas (four to 14 pounds) present considerably lower risks. These remnants are being detected and excavated systematically for disposal. The U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency oversaw disposal of several other chemical weapons stockpiles located across the United States in compliance with international chemical weapons treaties. These include the complete incineration of the chemical weapons stockpiled in [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Indiana]], and [[Oregon]]. Earlier, this agency had also completed destruction of the chemical weapons stockpile located on [[Johnston Atoll]] located south of [[Hawaii]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref>[http://www.cma.army.mil/fndocumentviewer.aspx?docid=003676918 Milestones in U.S. Chemical Weapons Storage and Destruction, fact sheet]. [[United States Army Chemical Materials Agency|US Chemical Materials Agency]]</ref> The largest mustard gas stockpile, of about 6,196 [[ton]]s, was stored at the [[Deseret Chemical Depot]] in northern [[Utah]]. The incineration of this stockpile began in 2006. In May 2011, the last one-ton tank of mustard gas was incinerated at the Deseret Chemical Depot, and the last mustard gas artillery shells at Deseret were incinerated in January 2012.

The storage and incineration of mustard gas and other poison gasses was carried out by the U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency.<ref>[http://www.cma.army.mil/home.aspx The U.S. Army's Chemical Materials Agency (CMA)]. cma.army.mil. Retrieved on 2011-11-23.</ref> Disposal projects at the two remaining American chemical weapons sites, will be carried out at their sites near [[Richmond, Kentucky]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado]],

In 2002, an archaeologist at the Presidio Trust archaeology lab in San Francisco was exposed to mustard gas, which had been dug up at the Presidio of San Francisco, a former military base.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sullivan, Kathleen|title=Vial found in Presidio may be mustard gas / Army experts expected to identify substance|publisher=sfgate.com|date=2002-10-22|url=http://www.sfgate.com/green/article/Vial-found-in-Presidio-may-be-mustard-gas-Army-2760483.php}}</ref>

===Detection in biological fluids===
Urinary concentrations of the thiodiglycol hydrolysis products of sulfur mustard have been used to confirm a diagnosis of chemical poisoning in hospitalized victims. The presence in urine of 1,1'-sulfonylbismethylthioethane (SBMTE), a conjugation product with glutathione, is considered a more specific marker, since this metabolite is not found in specimens from unexposed persons. Intact sulfur mustard was detected in postmortem fluids and tissues of a man who died one week post-exposure.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 1463–1465.</ref>
