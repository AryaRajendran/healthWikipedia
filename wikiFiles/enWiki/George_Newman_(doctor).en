'''Sir George Newman''' [[GBE]], [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] (23 October 1870 - 26 May 1948) was an [[England|English]] [[public health]] [[physician]], [[Quaker]], the first [[Chief Medical Officer, United Kingdom|Chief Medical Officer]] to the [[Ministry of Health]] in [[England]], and wrote a seminal treatise on the social problems causing [[infant mortality]].

==Biography==
George Newman was born in [[Leominster]], [[Herefordshire]], the fourth of six children of Henry Stanley Newman and Mary Ann Pumphrey.  His father was a Quaker who undertook several missionary journeys, including one to [[India]], and edited [[The Friend (Quaker magazine)|The Friend]], a Quaker journal. Newman was educated at two  Quaker schools, [[Sidcot School]] in [[North Somerset]] (1881–1885) and [[Bootham School]] in [[York]] (1885–1887). He initially planned to become a missionary, but then decided to study [[medicine]], starting at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]] and continuing at [[King's College London]]. After qualifying he studied for his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] at Edinburgh, receiving the gold medal for his year, before winning a scholarship to study public health and gaining his Diploma in Public Health in 1895 from the [[University of Cambridge]].

He became a demonstrator in [[bacteriology]] and lecturer in infectious diseases at King's.<ref name=Dunn>[http://fn.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/90/3/F278.pdf "Sir George Newman, MD (1870–1948) and the prevention of perinatal disease" ''Arch. Dis. Child. Fetal Neonatal Ed. 2005;90;278-280.'' Accessed 26 February 2007]</ref>  In 1900 he became Medical Officer to the Borough of [[Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury|Finsbury]] in inner [[London]] and the rural county of [[Bedfordshire]]. His experiences in these posts led him to publish ''Infant Mortality: a Social Problem'' in 1906. This has remained a medical classic, pointing out the unchanged infant mortality rate over the preceding fifty years, and identifying the causes and areas potentially open to intervention. In 1907 he was appointed by Sir [[Robert Laurie Morant|Robert Morant]], [[Permanent Secretary]] to the [[Board of Education]], as Chief Medical Officer to the Board, and in 1919 he was also appointed Chief Medical Officer to the Ministry of Health. The annual reports he wrote for both these posts were widely acclaimed as important and influential<ref name=Anon>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1558992&blobtype=pdf "Sir George Newman" ''Am J Publ Health. 1935;  ;754-755.'' Accessed 26 February 2007]</ref>

In August 1898 he married Adelaide Constance Thorp, who was an artist; they had no children.  They lived at [[Harrow Weald]] after he retired in 1935. He died in 1948 at [[The Retreat]], York.

==Quaker==
Born into a Quaker family, he remained a committed Christian throughout his life.  From 1899, for some forty years, he was the (anonymous) editor of the ''Friends' Quarterly Examiner'', a Quaker journal. In autumn 1914 he was involved in the establishment of the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]], which provided medical care for soldiers and civilians in the war zone, and following the introduction of [[conscription]] in 1916 he helped to negotiate exemptions for Quakers already serving with the FAU.

==Education==
In 1923 Newman was invited to address the centenary celebrations of his old school, Bootham.  He referred to [[Alcuin]], an eighth century educator and deacon whose three guiding principles were: holy living and holy learning; teaching understanding rather than repetition; and, finally, that education should be 'wisely and liberally furnished'.<ref name=Walker-Smith>[http://adc.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/85/5/440 "York, Alcuin, and Sir George Newman" ''Arch Dis Child 2001;85:440-441.'' Accessed 26 February 2007]</ref>  Newman believed that Quaker schools such as Bootham embodied these principles.  He maintained an interest in medical education, and in 1923 he wrote ''Recent Advances in Medical Education.''

==Public Health==
His initial contribution, ''Infant Mortality: a Social Problem'', was the forerunner of many writings about public health which proved respected and influential, including: ''Hygiene and Public Health'' in 1917, ''Outline of the Practice of Preventative Medicine'' in 1919, ''The Rise of Preventative Medicine'' in 1932, and ''The Building of the Nation’s Health'' in 1939.  His annual reports as the Chief Medical Officer to the Ministry of Health were eagerly awaited each year, and were widely regarded as authoritative monographs on a variety of aspects of this field.
