'''[[Human lung|Lung]] volumes''' and '''lung capacities''' refer to the [[volume]] of air associated with different phases of the respiratory cycle. Lung volumes are directly measured; Lung capacities are inferred from lung volumes.

The average total lung capacity of an adult human male is about 6 [[litres]] of [[air]],<ref name="mariebhoehn">{{cite book |title=Human Anatomy and Physiology (8th Ed.)|last=Marieb |first=Elaine |authorlink= |coauthors=Hoehn, Katja |year=2010 |publisher=Prentice Hall PTR |location= |isbn=978-0-321-69415-7 |page=824 |url= |accessdate=March 2012}}</ref> but only a small amount of this capacity is used during normal [[breath]]ing.

Tidal breathing is normal, resting breathing; the [[tidal volume]] is the volume of air that is inhaled or exhaled in only a single such breath.
{{Pulmonary function}}

The average human [[respiratory rate]] is 30-60 breaths per minute at birth,<ref name="DeBoer2004">{{cite book|author=Scott L. DeBoer|title=Emergency Newborn Care|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TooUSUFZkY4C&pg=PA30|date=4 November 2004|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4120-3089-2|page=30}}</ref> decreasing to 12-20 breaths per minute in adults.<ref name="LindhPooler2009">{{cite book|author1=Wilburta Q.

==Factors affecting volumes==
Several factors affect lung volumes; some can be controlled and some cannot. Lung volumes vary with different people as follows:

A person who is born and lives at [[sea level]] will develop a slightly smaller lung capacity than a person who spends their life at a high [[altitude]]. This is because the partial pressure of oxygen is lower at higher altitude which, as a result means that oxygen less readily diffuses into the bloodstream. In response to higher altitude, the body's diffusing capacity increases in order to process more air.

When someone living at or near sea level travels to locations at high altitudes (e.g., the [[Andes]]; [[Denver, Colorado]]; [[Tibet]]; the [[Himalayas]]; etc.) that person can develop a condition called [[altitude sickness]] because their lungs remove adequate amounts of carbon dioxide but they do not take in enough oxygen. (In normal individuals, carbon dioxide is the primary determinant of respiratory drive.)

[[Maternal physiological changes in pregnancy#Respiratory|Specific changes]] in lung volumes also occur during pregnancy. Decreased [[functional residual capacity]] is seen, typically falling from 1.7 to 1.35 litres,{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} due to the compression of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] by the uterus. The compression also causes a decreased [[total lung capacity]] (TLC) by 5% and decreased [[expiratory reserve volume]]. [[Tidal volume]] increases with 30-40%, from 0.45 to 0.65 litres,{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} and [[minute ventilation]] by 30-40%<ref name="isbn81-8147-920-3">{{cite book |author= Guyton and hall |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |edition=11 |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2005 |origyear= |pages= 103g |quote= |isbn=81-8147-920-3 |oclc= |doi= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> giving an increase in pulmonary ventilation. This is necessary to meet the increased oxygen requirement of the body, which reaches 50&nbsp;mL/min, 20&nbsp;mL of which goes to reproductive tissues. Overall, the net change in maximum breathing capacity is zero.<ref name="simpson breathing">{{cite book |last= Simpson |first= Kathleen Rice |coauthors= Patricia A Creehan |title= Perinatal Nursing |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=oz_4cTmVFD4C&pg=PA66 |edition= 3rd |year= 2007 |publisher= Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |isbn= 978-0-7817-6759-0 |pages= 65–66}}</ref>

The ''tidal volume'', ''vital capacity'', ''inspiratory capacity'' and ''expiratory reserve volume'' can be measured directly with a [[spirometer]]. These are the basic elements of a ventilatory ''[[pulmonary function test]]''.

Determination of the ''residual volume'' is more difficult as it is impossible to "completely" breathe out. Therefore measurement of the residual volume has to be done via indirect methods such as radiographic planimetry, [[body plethysmography]], closed circuit dilution (including the [[helium dilution technique]]) and [[nitrogen washout]].

In absence of such, estimates of ''residual volume'' have been prepared as a proportion of body mass for infants (18.1ml/kg),<ref>{{cite journal | author =  Morris, Mohy G.| title = Comprehensive integrated spirometry using raised volume passive and forced expirations and multiple-breath nitrogen washout in infants | journal =  Respiratory Physiology & Neurobiology | volume = 170 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–140  | year = 2010 | issn = 15699048 | doi = 10.1016/j.resp.2009.10.010 | pmid =  19897058 | pmc =  2858579}}</ref> or as a proportion of ''vital capacity'' (0.24 for men and 0.28 for women)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wilmore, J.

==Restrictive and obstructive==
The results (in particular [[FEV1/FVC]] and FRC) can be used to distinguish between restrictive and obstructive pulmonary diseases:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Type''' || '''Examples''' || '''Description''' || '''FEV1/FVC'''
 |-
 | ''restrictive diseases''  || [[pulmonary fibrosis]], Infant Respiratory Distress Syndrome, weak respiratory muscles, pneumothorax || volumes are decreased  || often in a normal range (0.8 - 1.0)
 |-
 | ''obstructive diseases'' || [[asthma]] or [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] || volumes are essentially normal but flow rates are impeded || often low (Asthma can reduce the ratio to 0.6, Emphysema can reduce the ratio to 0.78 - 0.45)
