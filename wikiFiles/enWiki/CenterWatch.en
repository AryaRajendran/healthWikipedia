CenterWatch was founded in 1994 by Ken Getz, a senior [[research fellow]] at [[Tufts University]], and [[Robert Whitaker]], an author and medical journalist. In 1998, CenterWatch became Thomson CenterWatch when the company was acquired by Medical Economics, a division of [[The Thomson Corporation]], now [[Thomson Reuters]]. In 2007, Thomson sold the company to Jobson Medical Information LLC, an integrated healthcare information and communications services provider. In April 2010, Getz reacquired CenterWatch along with a group of private equity investors.<ref name= "nineteentharticle">{{cite news | title = CenterWatch Acquired by Founder Ken Getz | publisher = Applied Clinical Trials Online| url = http://appliedclinicaltrialsonline.findpharma.com/appliedclinicaltrials/News/CenterWatch-Acquired-by-Founder-Ken-Getz/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/669031?contextCategoryId=3300&ref=25| accessdate = 2010-07-15}}</ref>
