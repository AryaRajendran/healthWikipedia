[[File:Normal Epidermis and Dermis with Intradermal Nevus 10x-cropped.JPG|thumb|330px|Normal Epidermis and Dermis with Intradermal Nevus 10x-cropped]]A '''benign tumor''' is a mass of cells ([[tumor]]) that lacks the ability to invade neighboring tissue or [[Metastasis|metastasize]]. These characteristics are required for a tumor to be defined as [[cancer]]ous and therefore benign tumors are non-cancerous. Also, benign tumors generally have a slower growth rate than malignant tumors and the tumor cells are usually more differentiated (cells have normal features).<ref name="isbn0-443-10101-9">{{cite book |author=Wilson, Kathleen Atkins; Waugh, Anne; Chambers, Graeme; Grant, Allison; Ross, Janet |title=Ross and Wilson anatomy and physiology in health and illness |publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh |year=2006 |pages=53–54 |isbn=0-443-10101-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="isbn0-7613-2833-5">{{cite book |author=Nunn, Laura Silverstein; Silverstein, Alvin; Silverstein, Virginia B.|title=Cancer|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books |location=Brookfield, Conn |year=2006|pages=11–12|isbn=0-7613-2833-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="isbn0-7817-9516-8">{{cite book|author=David Lowell Strayer; Raphael Rubin; Rubin, Emanuel |title=Rubin's pathology: clinicopathologic foundations of medicine |publisher=Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2008 |pages=138–139|isbn=0-7817-9516-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Benign tumors are typically surrounded by an outer surface (fibrous sheath of [[connective tissue]]) or remain with the epithelium.<ref name="isbn0-321-31198-1">{{cite book|author=Ober, William B.; Martini, Frederic |title=Fundamentals of anatomy & physiology |publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings |location=San Francisco |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-321-31198-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Common examples of benign tumors include [[Melanocytic nevus|moles]] (nevi) and [[uterine fibroid]]s (leiomyomas).

Benign neoplasms are typically but not always composed of cells which bear a strong resemblance to a normal cell type in their organ of origin. These tumors are named for the cell or tissue type from which they originate, followed by the suffix "-oma" (but not -carcinoma, -sarcoma, or -blastoma, which are generally cancers). For example, a [[lipoma]] is a common benign tumor of fat cells ([[lipocyte]]s), and a [[chondroma]] is a benign tumor of cartilage-forming cells ([[chondrocyte]]s). [[Adenoma]]s are benign tumors of gland-forming cells, and are usually specified further by their cell or organ of origin, as in [[hepatic adenoma]] (a benign tumor of [[hepatocyte]]s, or [[liver]] cells). [[Teratoma]]s contain many cell types such as skin, nerve, brain and thyroid, among others, because they are derived from germ cells.<ref name="isbn0-7817-9516-8"/> [[Hamartoma]]s are a group of benign tumors that have relatively normal [[cellular differentiation]] but the architecture of the tissue is disorganised.<ref name="pmid15624019">{{cite journal |author=Inoki K, Corradetti MN, Guan KL |title=Dysregulation of the TSC-mTOR pathway in human disease|journal=Nat.

==Health effects==
Benign tumors are very diverse, and may be asymptomatic or may cause specific symptoms depending on their anatomic location and tissue type. They grow outwards, producing large rounded masses, which can cause what is known as a "mass effect". This growth can cause compression of local tissues or organs, which can cause many effects such as blockage of ducts, reduced blood flow ([[ischaemia]]), tissue death ([[necrosis]]) and nerve pain or damage.<ref name="isbn0-443-10101-9"/> Some tumors also produce hormones that can lead to life-threatening situations. [[Insulinoma]]s can produce large amounts of insulin leading to [[hypoglycemia]].<ref name="pmid1665409">{{cite journal |author=Marks V, Teale JD |title=Tumours producing hypoglycaemia |journal=Diabetes Metab Rev |volume=7|issue=2 |pages=79–91 |year=1991 |month=June |pmid=1665409 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid16253900">{{cite journal|author=Grant CS |title=Insulinoma |journal=Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=783–98|year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16253900 |doi=10.1016/j.bpg.2005.05.008 |url=}}</ref> [[Pituitary adenoma]]s can cause elevated levels of hormones such as [[growth hormone]] and [[insulin-like growth factor-1]], which cause[[acromegaly]]; [[prolactin]]; [[ACTH]] and [[cortisol]], which cause [[Cushings disease]]; [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]], which causes [[hyperthyroidism]]; and [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]] and [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]].<ref name="isbn92-832-2416-7">{{cite book |author=Charis Eng; DeLellis, Ronald A.; Lloyd, Ricardo V.; Phillipp U.

==Treatment==
Some benign tumors need no treatment; others may be removed if they cause problems such as seizures, discomfort or cosmetic concerns. [[Surgery]] is usually the most effective approach and is used to treat most benign tumors. In some case other treatments may be of use.

==Benign vs malignant==
[[File:BENIGN AND MALIGNANT TUMOUR.png|thumb|Diagram showing two [[epithelium|epithelial]] tumours. The upper tumour is a benign tumour that is non-invasive. Benign tumours are usually round in shape and encapsulated by fibrous connective tissue. The lower picture depicts a malignant tumour. It is irregularly shaped, vascular, and it is invasive, crossing the [[basement membrane]].]]
One of the most important factors in classifying a tumor as benign or malignant is its invasive potential. If a tumor lacks the ability to invade adjacent [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s or spread to distant sites by metastastasizing then it is benign, whereas invasive or metastatic tumours are malignant.<ref name="isbn0-443-10101-9"/> For this reason, benign tumours are not classed as cancer.<ref name="isbn0-7613-2833-5"/> Benign tumours will grow in a contained area usually encapsulated in a fibrous [[connective tissue]] capsule. The growth rates of benign and malignant tumors also differ; benign tumors generally grow more slowly than malignant tumors. Although benign tumors pose a lower health risk than malignant tumors, they can both be life-threatening in certain situations. There are many general characteristics which apply to either benign or malignant tumors, but sometimes one type may show characteristics of the other. For example, benign tumors are mostly well differentiated and malignant tumors are often undifferentiated. However, undifferentiated benign tumors and differentiated malignant tumors can occur.<ref name="pmid10366409">{{cite journal |author=Skorić T, Korsić M, Zarković K, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical and morphological features of undifferentiated monomorphous GH/TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma |journal=Eur.

==Multistage carcinogenesis==
Tumours are formed by [[carcinogenesis]], a process in which cellular alterations lead to the formation of cancer. Multistage carcinogenesis involves the sequential [[genetics|genetic]] or [[epigenetic]] changes to a cells [[DNA]], where each step produces a more advanced tumour. It is often broken down into three stages; initiation, promotion and progression, and several mutations may occur at each stage. Initiation is where the first genetic mutation occurs in a cell. Promotion is the clonal expansion (repeated division) of this transformed cell into a visible tumour that is usually benign. Following promotion, progression may take place where more genetic mutations are acquired in a sub-population of tumor cells. Progression changes the benign tumor into a malignant tumor.<ref name="pmid1911211"/><ref name="pmid8354184">{{cite journal |author=Barrett JC |title=Mechanisms of multistep carcinogenesis and carcinogen risk assessment |journal=Environ. Health Perspect. |volume=100 |issue= |pages=9–20 |year=1993 |month=April |pmid=8354184|pmc=1519586 |doi= |url=}}</ref> A prominent and well studied example of this phenomenon is the tubular adenoma, a common type of [[colon polyp]] which is an important precursor to colon cancer. The cells in tubular adenomas, like most tumors which frequently progress to cancer, show certain abnormalities of cell maturation and appearance collectively known as [[dysplasia]]. These cellular abnormalities are not seen in benign tumors that rarely or never turn cancerous, but are seen in other pre-cancerous tissue abnormalities which do not form discrete masses, such as [[cervical intraepithelial neoplasia|pre-cancerous lesions of the uterine cervix]]. Some authorities{{who|date=March 2013}} prefer to refer to dysplastic tumors as "pre-malignant", and reserve the term "benign" for tumors which rarely or never give rise to cancer.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Syndromes==

===PTEN hamartoma syndrome===
PTEN hamartoma syndrome comprises four distinct hamartomatous disorders characterised by genetic mutations in the [[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]] gene; [[Cowden syndrome]], [[Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome]], [[Proteus syndrome]] and [[Proteus-like syndrome]]. Although they all have distinct clinical features, the formation of [[hamartoma]]s is present in all four syndromes. PTEN is a [[tumor suppressor]] gene that is involved in [[cellular signalling]]. Absent or dysfunctional PTEN protein allows cells to over-proliferate, causing hamartomas.<ref name="pmid19668082">{{cite journal|author=Hobert JA, Eng C |title=PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome: an overview |journal=Genet.

===Familial adenomatous polyposis===

[[Familial adenomatous polyposis]] (FAP) is a familial cancer syndrome caused by mutations in the [[APC gene]]. In this disorder adenomatous polyps are present in the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] that invariably progress into [[colon cancer]].<ref name="pmid16454848">{{cite journal |author=Galiatsatos P, Foulkes WD |title=Familial adenomatous polyposis|journal=Am.

These cause the upregulation of many genes involved in cell [[cell growth|proliferation]], [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]], [[cell migration|migration]] and [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death), causing the growth of benign tumors.<ref name="pmid17881494">{{cite journal |author=Aoki K, Taketo MM |title=Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC): a multi-functional tumor suppressor gene |journal=J.

===Tuberous sclerosis complex===
[[Tuberous sclerosis complex]] (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in the genes[[TSC1]] and [[TSC2]], which produce the proteins [[hamartin]] and [[tuberin]], respectively. This disorder presents with many benign hamartomatous tumors including [[angiofibroma]]s, renal [[angiomyolipoma]]s, pulmonary [[lymphangiomyomatosis]]. Tuberin and hamartin inhibit the [[mTOR]] protein in normal cellular physiology and the inactivation of the TSC tumour suppressors causes an increase in mTOR activity. This leads to the activation of genes and the production of proteins that increase cell growth.<ref name="pmid15624019"/><ref name="pmid17005952">{{cite journal |author=Crino PB, Nathanson KL, Henske EP |title=The tuberous sclerosis complex |journal=N.

===Von Hippel-Lindau disease===
[[Von Hippel-Lindau disease]] is a dominantly inherited cancer syndrome that massively increases the risk of various tumors including benign [[hemangioblastoma]]s and malignant [[pheochromocytoma]]s, [[renal cell carcinoma]]s, [[pancreatic endocrine tumor]]s and [[endolymphatic sac tumor]]s. It is caused by genetic mutations in the [[Von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor]] gene. The VHL protein (pVHL) is involved in cellular signalling in oxygen starved ([[Tumor hypoxia|hypoxic]]) cells. One role of pVHL is to cause the cellular degradation of another protein, [[HIF1A|HIF1α]]. Dysfunctional pVHL leads to accumulation of HIF1α, which in turn activates the production of several genes involved in cell growth and blood vessel production ([[VEGF]], [[PDGFB|PDGFβ]], [[TGFα]] and [[erythropoietin]]).<ref name="pmid15579030">{{cite journal |author=Maher ER |title=Von Hippel-Lindau disease |journal=Curr.
