'''Siddhartha Mukherjee''' ({{lang-bn|<big>সিদ্ধার্থ মুখার্জী</big>}}; born 1970) is an [[Indian American|Indian-born American]] physician, scientist and author. He wrote the 2010 book, ''[[The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer]]'', which won the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction]] and the [[Guardian Prize]], was nominated for the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] and was described by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as one of the 100 most influential books of the last 100 years, and by ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' as among the 100 best works of non-fiction. 

Currently he is an assistant professor of medicine at [[Columbia University]] and staff physician at [[Columbia University Medical Center]] in [[New York City]]. He has been the Plummer Visiting Professor at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Rochester, the Joseph Garland lecturer at the [[Massachusetts Medical Society]] and an honorary visiting professor at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]].

A [[hematology|hematologist]] and [[oncology|oncologist]], Mukherjee is also known for his work on the formation of blood and the interactions between the micro-environment (or "niche") and cancer cells.

==Early life and education==
Siddhartha Mukherjee was born in [[New Delhi]], [[India]] to Sibeswar Mukherjee, an executive with [[Mitsubishi]], and Chandana Mukherjee, a former schoolteacher. He attended [[St. Columba's School, Delhi|St. Columba's School]] in Delhi. As a biology major at [[Stanford University]], he worked in Nobel Laureate [[Paul Berg]]'s laboratory defining cellular genes that change the behaviours of cancer cells.
Mukherjee then won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[Oxford University]], where he earned a [[DPhil]] in [[immunology]] from [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. After graduation, he attended [[Harvard Medical School]] (HST) where he earned an M.D.  His postgraduate years consisted of a residency in [[internal medicine]] followed by an [[oncology]] [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Cancer's Biographer | url = http://news.columbia.edu/record/2238 | last = Levin | first = Ann | publisher = The Record (Columbia University) | accessdate = 6 September 2011}}</ref>

==Career==
Mukherjee is currently serving as Assistant Professor of Medicine at Medicine (Oncology) Department, [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/books/09mukherjee.html | title = How Cancer Acquired Its Own Biographer | last = McGrath | first = Charles | date = 8 November 2010 | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 6 September 2011}}</ref> He is also a staff cancer physician at [[Columbia University Medical Center]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/books/ci_16711249 | work=Denver Post | title=Review: "The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer," by Siddhartha Mukherjee | last =Okie | first = Susan |date=November 28, 2010 | accessdate = 6 September 2011}}</ref> 

In 2010, [[Simon & Schuster]] published his book, ''The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer'',<ref name="Mukherjee2010">{{cite book|last=Mukherjee|first=Siddhartha|title=The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5rF_31RVTnMC|accessdate=6 September 2011|date=16 November 2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-0795-9}}</ref> detailing the evolution of diagnosis and treatment of human cancers from ancient Egypt to the latest developments in [[chemotherapy]] and [[targeted therapy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1091110/jsp/frontpage/story_11718907.jsp | publisher = The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | title = Chronicler of cancer, emperor of maladies | last = Roy | first = Amit | date = 10 November 2009 | accessdate = 6 September 2011}}</ref> [[O: The Oprah Magazine|The Oprah magazine]] listed it in its "Top 10 Books of 2010".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.oprah.com/book/The-Emperor-of-All-Maladies-A-Biography-of-Cancer-by-Siddhartha-Mukherjee?cat_id= | title = The Emperor of All Maladies (Book Review) | publisher = Oprah.com | last = Sehgal | first = Parul | accessdate = 6 September 2011}}</ref> It was also listed in "The 10 Best Books of 2010" by ''The New York Times''<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/books/review/10-best-books-of-2010.html | work=The New York Times | title=The 10 Best Books of 2010 | date=1 December 2010 | accessdate = 6 September 2011}}</ref> and the "Top 10 Nonfiction Books" by Time magazine.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2035319_2034029_2034019,00.html | work=Time | title=The Top 10 Everything Of 2010 | date=9 December 2010 | accessdate = 6 September 2011}}</ref> 

In 2011 ''The Emperor of All Maladies: A History of Cancer'' was nominated as a [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] finalist. On April 18, it was announced that Mukherjee's book had won the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction]]. Mukherjee also received the [[PEN/E. O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award]] in 2011. [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine also nominated Mukherjee to its "100 most influential people" list and selected his book for its list of the 100 best non-fiction books since 1923.

A hematologist and oncologist by training, Mukherjee's scientific work addresses the links between normal [[stem cell]]s and cancer cells. Mukherjee's lab has performed investigations on the microenvironment—or niche—of stem cells, focusing particularly on blood-forming stem cells.  Blood-forming stem cells (called [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s or HSCs) reside in the [[bone marrow]] in very specific microenvironments.  [[Osteoblast]]s, or bone-forming cells, comprise an important element of this niche, and they regulate the physiology of HSCs, by providing HSCs with signals to divide, remain quiescent, or maintain their stem cell properties. Mukherjee's scientific work has been recognized through many [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] and private foundation grants, including the prestigious NIH "Challenge Grant" awarded to pioneering researchers in 2009.

In work performed with collaborators in the 1990s and 2000s,  Mukherjee's lab identified genes and chemicals that can alter the microenvironment, or niche, and thereby alter the behaviour of normal stem cells, as well as cancer cells.  Two such chemicals studied in the lab - [[proteasome inhibitor]]s and [[Activin and inhibin|Activin A inhibitor]]s—are currently in [[clinical trial]]s with novel therapeutic uses as defined by these studies.  The lab has also identified novel [[Mutation|genetic mutation]]s in [[Myelodysplastic syndrome|myelodysplasia]] and [[Acute myeloid leukemia|acute myelogenous leukemia]] and has played a leading role in finding therapies for these diseases in the clinical setting. Mukherjee's lab is based at Columbia University's Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center. Previously, he was affiliated with the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and with [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in Boston. 

Mukherjee has published widely in scientific journals, including papers in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', ''[[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]]'', the ''[[Journal of Clinical Investigation]]'', ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' and others.

==Personal life==
Mukherjee lives in New York and is married to artist [[Sarah Sze]], winner of a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur "Genius" grant]] and chosen as the U.S. representative at the 2013 [[Venice Biennale]]. They have two daughters, Leela and Aria.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.npr.org/2010/11/17/131382460/an-oncologist-writes-a-biography-of-cancer | title = An Oncologist Writes 'A Biography Of Cancer' | publisher = NPR | date = 17 November 2010 | accessdate = 6 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/11/08/101108crbo_books_shapin | title = Cancer World: The Making of a Modern Disease | publisher = The New Yorker | date = 8 November 2010 | last = Shapin | first = Steven | accessdate = 6 September 2011}}</ref>
