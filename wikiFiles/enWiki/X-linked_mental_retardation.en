'''X-linked mental retardation''' (also known as '''X-linked intellectual disability''') refers to forms of [[mental retardation]] which are specifically associated with [[X-linked recessive inheritance]].

As with most X-linked disorders, males are more heavily affected than females.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibis-birthdefects.org/start/frafact.htm |title=Fragile X Syndrome - X-linked Mental Retardation and Macroorchidism |publisher=International Birth Defect Information Systems |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref> Females with one affected [[X chromosome]] and one normal X chromosome tend to have milder symptoms.

Unlike many other types of mental retardation, the genetics of these conditions are relatively well understood.<ref name="pmid15630421">{{cite doi|10.1038/nrg1501}}</ref><ref name="pmid17873643">{{cite doi|10.1097/GIM.0b013e318149e647}}</ref> It has been estimated there are ~200 genes involved in this syndrome; of these ~100 have been identified.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1002/ddrr.81}}</ref>

X-linked mental retardation accounts for ~16% of all cases of intellectual disability in males.

==Syndromes==
Several X-linked syndromes include retardation as part of the presentation. These include [[Coffin-Lowry syndrome]], [[MASA syndrome]], and [[X-linked alpha thalassemia mental retardation syndrome]].

==List of genes==
Following is a list of genes located on the X chromosome and linked to mental retardation. There are also several loci that have not been associated with a specific gene.

AFF2/FMR2, AFF3/LAF4 and AFF4/AF5q31 localize in nuclear speckles (subnuclear structures considered to be storage/modification sites of pre-mRNA splicing factors) and are able to bind RNA with a high apparent affinity for the G-quadruplex structure. They appear to modulate alternative splicing via the interaction with the G-quadruplex RNA-forming structure.
