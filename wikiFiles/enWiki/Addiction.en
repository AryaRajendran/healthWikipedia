Addictions can include, but are not limited to, [[drug abuse]], [[exercise addiction]], [[sexual addiction]] and [[gambling]].  Classic hallmarks of addiction include impaired control over substances or behavior, preoccupation with substance or behavior, continued use despite consequences, and denial.<ref name="pmid1501306">{{cite journal | author = Morse RM, Flavin DK | title = The definition of alcoholism.

[[Physiological dependence]] occurs when the body has to adjust to the substance by incorporating the substance into its 'normal' functioning.<ref name="pmid10511013">{{cite journal | author = Torres G, Horowitz JM | title = Drugs of abuse and brain gene expression | journal = Psychosom Med | volume = 61 | issue = 5 | pages = 630–50 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10511013 | doi =  }}</ref> This state creates the conditions of [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[withdrawal]]. Tolerance is the process by which the body continually adapts to the substance and requires increasingly larger amounts to achieve the original effects. Withdrawal refers to physical and psychological symptoms experienced when  reducing or discontinuing a substance that the body has become dependent on. Symptoms of withdrawal generally include but are not limited to [[anxiety]], [[irritability]], intense [[craving (withdrawal)|craving]]s for the substance, [[nausea]], [[hallucinations]], [[headaches]], cold sweats, and [[tremors]].

==Behavioral addiction==
{{Main|Behavioral addiction|Addictive behavior}}
The term ''addiction'' is also sometimes applied to compulsions that are not substance-related, such as compulsive shopping, sex addiction/compulsive sex, overeating, problem gambling, exercise/sport and [[computer addiction]]. Sometimes the compulsion is not to "do" something but to avoid or "do nothing" e.g. [[procrastination]] (compulsive task avoidance).<ref>Procrastinators Anonymous website http://procrastinators-anonymous.org/node/8</ref><ref>Pychyl, T.

There may be biological and psychological factors contributing to these addictions.<ref>{{Cite document | author = Pargman D, Burgess S | title = Hooked on Exercise: A Psycho-Biological Explanation | work=1977 Annual Meeting of North American Society for the Psychology of Sport and Physical Activity | year = 1977 | oclc = 425154924 }}</ref>

==Biological mechanisms==
{{Refimprove|date=August 2012}}
Addiction research indicates that biological mechanisms are present. There are many variables, which the studies disagree over, among the primary contributing factors. As discussed in [[Nature versus nurture]], the biological "nature" of individual innate qualities can account for many decisions and actions, such as a family history in which [[genetics]], [[DNA]], and other [[mental disorder]]s remain dormant for generations and then are triggered. Professional treatment providers have differing opinions on this issue. 

On the other hand, addictive behavior can be due to the environmental "nurture" of an individual's [[behavioral modification]], from positive relationships to negative abuse, including the social interactions and environmental elements, like toxic poisoning, that can exist in each person's "world". Some groups accept both "nature" and "nurture" as equally valid sides of a person's psyche, while studying each individual major action on a case-by-[[case analysis]] basis. For example, a patient's liver problem might be caused by [[hepatitis]] and abuse of alcohol, with one factor not ruling out the other.

==Personality theories of addiction==

===Role of affect dysregulation in addiction===
Research has consistently shown strong associations between [[affective disorders]] and [[substance use disorders]]. Specifically, people with [[mood disorders]] are at increased risk of substance use disorders.<ref name="Cheetham_2010">{{cite journal | author = Cheetham A, Allen NB, Yücel M, Lubman DI | title = The role of affective dysregulation in drug addiction | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 621–34 | year = 2010 | month = August | pmid = 20546986 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2010.04.005 | url = }}</ref> Affect and addiction can be related in a variety of ways as they play a crucial role in influencing motivated behaviours. For instance, affect facilitates action, directs attention, prepares the individual for a physical response, and guides behaviour to meet particular needs.<ref name=Gross_1998>{{cite journal | author = Gross JJ | title = The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review | journal = Review of General Psychology | year = 1998 | month = September | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 271–299 | doi = 10.1037/1089-2680.2.3.271 }}</ref>  Moreover, affect is implicated in a range of concepts relevant to addiction: [[negative reinforcement]] and [[positive reinforcement]], behaviour [[motivation]], regulation of [[cognition]] and [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], and [[reasoning]] and [[decision making]].<ref name="pmid11992656">{{cite journal | author = Bechara A, Damasio H | title = Decision-making and addiction (part I): impaired activation of somatic states in substance dependent individuals when pondering decisions with negative future consequences | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 40 | issue = 10 | pages = 1675–89 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11992656 | doi =10.1016/S0028-3932(02)00015-5 }}</ref><ref name=Quirk_2009>{{cite journal | author= Quirk SW| title = Emotion concepts in models of substance abuse | journal = Drug and Alcohol Review | year = 2009 | month = May | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 95–104 | doi = 10.1080/09595230125185 }}</ref>  Emotion-motivated reasoning has been shown to influence addictive behaviours via selecting outcomes that minimize negative affective states while maximizing positive affective states.<ref name="pmid17069484">{{cite journal | author = Westen D, Blagov PS, Harenski K, Kilts C, Hamann S | title = Neural bases of motivated reasoning: an FMRI study of emotional constraints on partisan political judgment in the 2004 U.S. Presidential election | journal = J Cogn Neurosci | volume = 18 | issue = 11 | pages = 1947–58 | year = 2006 | month = November | pmid = 17069484 | doi = 10.1162/jocn.2006.18.11.1947 }}</ref>

====Negative affect====
The relationship between negative affect and substance use disorders has been the most widely studied model of addiction. It proposes that individuals who experience the greatest levels of [[negative affect]] are at the greatest risk of using substances or behaviours as a [[coping (psychology)]] mechanism.<ref name="pmid7365134">{{cite journal | author = McCollam JB, Burish TG, Maisto SA, Sobell MB | title = Alcohol's effects on physiological arousal and self-reported affect and sensations | journal = J Abnorm Psychol | volume = 89 | issue = 2 | pages = 224–33 | year = 1980 | month = April | pmid = 7365134 | doi =10.1037/0021-843X.89.2.224 }}</ref><ref name="pmid16938060">{{cite journal | author = Measelle JR, Stice E, Springer DW | title = A prospective test of the negative affect model of substance abuse: moderating effects of social support | journal = Psychol Addict Behav | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 225–33 | year = 2006 | month = September | pmid = 16938060 | pmc = 1560098 | doi = 10.1037/0893-164X.20.3.225 }}</ref> Here, substances and behaviours are used to improve mood and distract from unpleasant feelings. Once [[physical dependence]] has been established, substance abuse is primarily motivated by a desire to avoid negative affective states associated with withdrawal. Individuals high in affective mood disorders ([[anxiety]]) most commonly report high levels of negative affect associated with [[craving (withdrawal)|craving]]s.<ref name="pmid8201629">{{cite journal | author = Childress AR, Ehrman R, McLellan AT, MacRae J, Natale M, O'Brien CP | title = Can induced moods trigger drug-related responses in opiate abuse patients? | journal = J Subst Abuse Treat | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–23 | year = 1994 | pmid = 8201629 | doi =10.1016/0740-5472(94)90060-4 }}</ref><ref name="pmid9131844">{{cite journal | author = Cooney NL, Litt MD, Morse PA, Bauer LO, Gaupp L | title = Alcohol cue reactivity, negative-mood reactivity, and relapse in treated alcoholic men | journal = J Abnorm Psychol | volume = 106 | issue = 2 | pages = 243–50 | year = 1997 | month = May | pmid = 9131844 | doi =10.1037/0021-843X.106.2.243 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17295723">{{cite journal | author = Fox HC, Bergquist KL, Hong KI, Sinha R | title = Stress-induced and alcohol cue-induced craving in recently abstinent alcohol-dependent individuals | journal = Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 395–403 | year = 2007 | month = March | pmid = 17295723 | doi = 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2006.00320.x }}</ref> However, the relationship between negative affect and addiction is not unidirectional. That is, while positive affect increases the likelihood of initiation of substance use, the negative affective states produced by withdrawal are the most commonly reported factors for continued use.<ref name="Cheetham_2010"/> 

Key to this concept is the '''Hedonic Hypothesis,''' which states that individuals initiate use of the substance or behaviour for their pleasurable effects, but then take it compulsively to avoid withdrawal symptoms, resulting in dependence.<ref name="pmid12185211">{{cite journal | author = Robinson TE, Berridge KC | title = Addiction | journal = Annu Rev Psychol | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = 25–53 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12185211 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145237 }}</ref>  Based on this hypothesis, some researchers believe that individuals engaging in risky use of substances or behaviours may be over-responsing to negative stimuli, which leads to addiction. 

Negative affect has also been a powerful predictor in terms of [[vulnerability]] to addiction in adolescents. High-risk adolescents have been found to be highly reactive to negative stimuli, which increases their motivation to engage in substance use following a negative emotion-arousing situation.<ref name="randall">{{cite journal | author = Randall DM, Cox WM | title = Experimental mood inductions in persons at high and low risk for alcohol problems | journal = Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 183–7 | year = 2001 | month = February | pmid = 11373034 | doi =10.1081/ADA-100103126 }}</ref>  Moreover, it has been established that adolescents high in negative affect are at increased risk for moving from recreational use to problematic use despite a family history of addiction.<ref name="randall"/> 

Furthermore, the trait '''negative urgency''', the propensity to engage in risky behaviour in response to [[distress (medicine)|distress]], is highly predictive of certain aspects of substance abuse in adolescents.<ref name="cyders">{{cite journal | author = Cyders MA, Smith GT, Spillane NS, Fischer S, Annus AM, Peterson C | title = Integration of impulsivity and positive mood to predict risky behavior: development and validation of a measure of positive urgency | journal = Psychol Assess | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 107–18 | year = 2007 | month = March | pmid = 17371126 | doi = 10.1037/1040-3590.19.1.107 | url = }}</ref> Early individual differences in emotional differences in reactivity and regulation underlie the later emergence of the trait 'negative urgency'.<ref name=Whiteside_2001>{{cite journal | author = Whiteside SP, Lynam DR | title = The Five Factor Model and impulsivity: using a structural model of personality to understand impulsivity | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | year = 2001 | month = March | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 669–689 | doi = 10.1016/S0191-8869(00)00064-7 }}</ref>

====Positive affect====
Unlike negative affect, positive affect is related to addiction in both high and low forms. For example, individuals high in positive affect are more likely to engage in risky behaviour, such as drug use. Individuals with high positive affect in response to use are more likely to seek out substances for [[hedonic]] reasons. Conversely, low  positive affect may prompt initial use due to lack of responsiveness to natural rewards.<ref name="Cheetham_2010"/>

Extensive personality research has been done that links positive emotional states to individual differences in risky behaviour.<ref name="Cheetham_2010"/> The trait '''positive urgency''', defined as the tendency to engage in risky behaviour under conditions of extreme positive affect, is predictive of substance or behavioural problems that lead to addiction.<ref name="pmid18954158">{{cite journal | author = Cyders MA, Smith GT | title = Emotion-based dispositions to rash action: positive and negative urgency | journal = Psychol Bull | volume = 134 | issue = 6 | pages = 807–28 | year = 2008 | month = November | pmid = 18954158 | pmc = 2705930 | doi = 10.1037/a0013341 }}</ref> This trait represents an underlying dysregulation in response to extreme affective states and has a direct impact on behaviour. The trait 'positive urgency' has been shown to have a predictive relationship with increases in drinking quantity and alcohol-related problems in college, as well as drug use in college.<ref name="cyders"/><ref name="pmid19586152">{{cite journal | author = Zapolski TC, Cyders MA, Smith GT | title = Positive urgency predicts illegal drug use and risky sexual behavior | journal = Psychol Addict Behav | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 348–54 | year = 2009 | month = June | pmid = 19586152 | pmc = 2709762 | doi = 10.1037/a0014684 }}</ref> Furthermore, this trait provides important information on how positive affect can increase the likelihood of engaging in substance abuse. 

Another important factor to consider is the individual differences in the experience of pleasurable effects brought on by the substance or behaviour. It is reasoned that certain individuals may be more sensitive to the pleasurable effects and thus experience them with greater intensity, resulting in addiction.<ref name="Cheetham_2010"/> For example, over-responsiveness to substance affects has been found in cocaine addicts - an increased response to methylphenidate in the brain regions associated with emotional reactivity and mood.<ref name="pmid10484959">{{cite journal | author = Volkow ND, Wang GJ, Fowler JS, Logan J, Gatley SJ, Gifford A, Hitzemann R, Ding YS, Pappas N | title = Prediction of reinforcing responses to psychostimulants in humans by brain dopamine D2 receptor levels | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 156 | issue = 9 | pages = 1440–3 | year = 1999 | month = September | pmid = 10484959 | doi = }}</ref><ref name="pmid15556111">{{cite journal | author = Volkow ND | title = The reality of comorbidity: depression and drug abuse | journal = Biol. Psychiatry | volume = 56 | issue = 10 | pages = 714–7 | year = 2004 | month = November | pmid = 15556111 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2004.07.007 }}</ref><ref name="pmid15829645">{{cite journal | author = Volkow ND, Wang GJ, Ma Y, Fowler JS, Wong C, Ding YS, Hitzemann R, Swanson JM, Kalivas P | title = Activation of orbital and medial prefrontal cortex by methylphenidate in cocaine-addicted subjects but not in controls: relevance to addiction | journal = J. Neurosci. | volume = 25 | issue = 15 | pages = 3932–9 | year = 2005 | month = April | pmid = 15829645 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0433-05.2005 }}</ref> Thus, strong emotional responses that addicted individuals show in response to substances or behaviours might be results of enhanced sensitivity to their effects.

Individuals differ in the way by which they [[metabolize]] substances, such as [[alcohol]]; these positive reinforcing effects are partly predetermined.<ref name="Cheetham_2010"/> Individual reactivity to the effects of substances may affect motivation to use. For example, if a person experiences strong positive (and weak negative) effects from a substance, due to their [[biochemical]] profile, their expectations of the positive effects from the substance will be heightened, therefore increasing their desire for continued use, resulting in dependence.<ref name="Cheetham_2010"/> According to this model, the experience of the positive mood enhances implicit attention to substance cues and implicit associations between [[Reward system|reward]] and substance use.<ref name="pmid3290306">{{cite journal | author = Cox WM, Klinger E | title = A motivational model of alcohol use | journal = J Abnorm Psychol | volume = 97 | issue = 2 | pages = 168–80 | year = 1988 | month = May | pmid = 3290306 | doi =10.1037/0021-843X.97.2.168 }}</ref>

Interestingly, many addicts report symptoms of [[anhedonia]] (i.e., the inability to experience pleasure).<ref name="pmid15942262">{{cite journal | author = Janiri L, Martinotti G, Dario T, Reina D, Paparello F, Pozzi G, Addolorato G, Di Giannantonio M, De Risio S | title = Anhedonia and substance-related symptoms in detoxified substance-dependent subjects: a correlation study | journal = Neuropsychobiology | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–44 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15942262 | doi = 10.1159/000086176 }}</ref> Results of chronic deviation of the brain's reward set point, which follow a prolonged intoxication, diminish responsiveness to natural positive stimuli. This may result in an over-responsiveness to substance-related cues, coupled with an impaired capacity to initiate behaviours in response to natural rewards.<ref name="pmid9311926">{{cite journal | author = Koob GF, Le Moal M | title = Drug abuse: hedonic homeostatic dysregulation | journal = Science | volume = 278 | issue = 5335 | pages = 52–8 | year = 1997 | month = October | pmid = 9311926 | doi =10.1126/science.278.5335.52 }}</ref> Thus, low positive affect inhibits the individual's ability to replace drug-taking with other rewarding activities. It has also been proposed that during substance dependence the [[somatic]] states that guide decision-making are weakened in relation to natural rewards, while at the same time they enhance the emotional response to drug-related stimuli.<ref name="pmid12635539">{{cite journal | author = Bechara A | title = Risky business: emotion, decision-making, and addiction | journal = J Gambl Stud | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–51 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12635539 | doi =10.1023/A:1021223113233 }}</ref>

Compulsive behaviours characterized by addiction are underpinned by two interacting systems: (a) impulsivity, and (b) reflection. Impulsivity is responsible for the rapid signalling of the affective importance of a stimuli. Reflection cognitively evaluates the signal before altering the behavioural response. Dysfunction in impulsivity exaggerates the emotional impact of the drug-related stimuli and attenuates the impact of natural reinforcement.<ref name="Cheetham_2010"/> Dysregulation in reflection results in the inability to override impulsivity, thus resulting in addiction.<ref name="Cheetham_2010"/> Under-responsiveness to naturally occurring positive stimuli is a crucial element that biases the individual towards the use of substances or behaviours and away from non-drug alternatives.

====Effortful control====
Temperamental effortful control is defined as the ability to suppress a [[dominant response]] in order to perform a [[subdominant]] response.<ref name="pmid14633060">{{cite journal | author = Rothbart MK, Ellis LK, Rueda MR, Posner MI | title = Developing mechanisms of temperamental effortful control | journal = J Pers | volume = 71 | issue = 6 | pages = 1113–43 | year = 2003 | month = December | pmid = 14633060 | doi =10.1111/1467-6494.7106009 }}</ref> In other words, it is the degree of control the individual has over impulses and emotions, which includes the ability to focus or shift attention. Temperamental effortful control can influence addiction in a number of ways. 

Low levels of effortful control can render the individual less able to distract themselves from unpleasant feelings or overcome strong affective impulses, resulting in maladaptive responses to distress - such as continued substance use.<ref name="Cheetham_2010"/> Low effortful control may also interact with negative and positive affect, predisposing individuals to substance or behavioural use, and impair their ability to control use.<ref name="Cheetham_2010"/> 

A general inability to control affective states may impair the conditioning of behaviour associated with rewards and punishment, may increase susceptibility to biasing by substance-related cues, and could tax self-regulatory capacity.<ref name="Cheetham_2010"/> Such conditions may render individuals unable to interrupt automatic drug-seeking behaviours. Abnormal levels of positive and negative affect can be increased by low effortful control.<ref name=Colder_1997>{{cite journal | author = Colder CR, Chassin L | title = Affectivity and impulsivity: Temperament risk for adolescent alcohol involvement | journal = Psychology of Addictive Behaviors | year = 1997 | month = June | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 83–97 | doi = 10.1037/0893-164X.11.2.83 }}</ref><ref name="pmid7861800">{{cite journal | author = Hussong AM, Chassin L | title = The stress-negative affect model of adolescent alcohol use: disaggregating negative affect | journal = J.

===Gray's reinforcement sensitivity theory===
Gray's [[Reinforcement sensitivity theory]] (RST) consists of two motivational systems: the Behaviour Inhibition System (BIS) and the Behaviour Activation System (BAS).<ref name="Gray">{{cite journal | author = Gray JA | title = The psychophysiological basis of introversion-extraversion | journal = Behav Res Ther | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 249–66 | year = 1970 | month = August | pmid = 5470377 | doi = 10.1016/0005-7967(70)90069-0| url = }}</ref><ref name="gray">{{cite book | author = McNaughton N, Gray ,JA | title = The neuropsychology of anxiety: an enquiry into the function of the septo-hippocampal system | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford [Oxfordshire] | year = 2000 | pages = | isbn = 0-19-852270-3 }}</ref>  The BIS is responsible for organizing behaviour in response to adverse stimuli. In other words, stimuli associated with punishment or the omission/termination of reward, are believed to underlie anxiety. The purpose of the BIS is to initiate behaviour inhibition, or interrupt ongoing behaviour,  while the BAS is sensitive to stimuli that signal reward and/or relief from punishment (impusivity).<ref name="Gray"/><ref name="gray"/> In accordance with the RST, an association was found between people with extreme scores in BIS/BAS and adjustment problems. BIS and BAS reactivity correspond with individual trait differences in positive affect and [[negative affect]] - The BAS is associated with trait impulsivity and positive affect, while the BIS is associated with trait negative affect.<ref name="pmid15456380">{{cite journal | author = Campbell-Sills L, Liverant GI, Brown TA | title = Psychometric evaluation of the behavioral inhibition/behavioral activation scales in a large sample of outpatients with anxiety and mood disorders | journal = Psychol Assess | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 244–54 | year = 2004 | month = September | pmid = 15456380 | doi = 10.1037/1040-3590.16.3.244 }}</ref><ref name="Jorm">{{cite journal | author = Jorm AR, Christensen H, Henderson AS, Jacomb PA, Korten AE, Rodgers B | title=Using the BIS/BAS scales to measure behavioural inhibition and behavioural activation: Factor structure, validity and norms in a large community sample | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | year=1998 | month = January | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–58 | doi = 10.1016/S0191-8869(98)00143-3 }}</ref> For instance, it has been postulated that high BIS is related to anxiety, while high BAS is related to conduct disorders or impulsivity.<ref name="gray"/><ref name="pmid9093895">{{cite journal | author = Quay HC | title = Inhibition and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder | journal = J Abnorm Child Psychol | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–13 | year = 1997 | month = February | pmid = 9093895 | doi =10.1023/A:1025799122529 }}</ref> 

According to this model substance abuse problems may arise under two different personality traits: low BIS and high BAS. Since the BAS promotes the individual to pursue actions that may result in reward, BAS sensitivity is involved in the initiation of addiction. Significant associations have been found between high BAS such as alcohol misuse in school girls, hazardous drinking in men, illicit drug abuse, and tobacco use. BAS sensitivity is a significant predictor of reactivity to substance cues, or cravings.<ref name=Franken_2006>{{cite journal | author = Franken IHA, Muris P | title = BIS/BAS personality characteristics and college students' substance use|journal=Personality and Individual Differences | year = 2006 | volume = 40 | issue = 7 | pages = 1497–1503 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2005.12.005 }}</ref><ref name="pmid18232522">{{cite journal | author = Genovese JE, Wallace D | title = Reward sensitivity and substance abuse in middle school and high school students | journal = J Genet Psychol | volume = 168 | issue = 4 | pages = 465–9 | year = 2007 | month = December | pmid = 18232522 | doi = 10.3200/GNTP.168.4.465-469 }}</ref><ref name=Kimbrel_2007>{{cite journal | author = Kimbrel NA, Nelson-Gray RO, Mitchell JT | title = Reinforcement sensitivity and maternal style as predictors of psychopathology | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | year = 2007 | month = April | volume = 42 | issue = 6 | pages = 1139–1149 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2006.06.028 }}</ref><ref name="pmid15283952">{{cite journal | author = Knyazev GG | title = Behavioural activation as predictor of substance use: mediating and moderating role of attitudes and social relationships | journal = Drug Alcohol Depend | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 309–21 | year = 2004 | month = September | pmid = 15283952 | doi = 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2004.03.007 }}</ref><ref name="pmid16846665">{{cite journal | author = Loxton NJ, Dawe S | title = Reward and punishment sensitivity in dysfunctional eating and hazardous drinking women: associations with family risk | journal = Appetite | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 361–71 | year = 2006 | month = November | pmid = 16846665 | doi = 10.1016/j.appet.2006.05.014 }}</ref><ref name=Loxton_2007>{{cite journal | author = Loxton NJ, Dawe S | title = How do dysfunctional eating and hazardous drinking women perform on behavioural measures of reward and punishment sensitivity?| journal = Personality and Individual Differences | year = 2007 | month = April | volume = 42 | issue = 6 | pages = 1163–1172 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2006.09.031}}</ref><ref name="O’Connor_2009">{{cite journal | author = O’Connor RM, Stewart SH, Watt MC|title=Distinguishing BAS risk for university students' drinking, smoking, and gambling behaviors|journal=Personality and Individual Differences | year = 2009 | month = March | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 514–519 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2008.12.002 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17407802">{{cite journal | author = Pardo Y, Aguilar R, Molinuevo B, Torrubia R | title = Alcohol use as a behavioural sign of disinhibition: evidence from J.A.

Low BIS has been positively associated with continuing the addiction to relieve feelings of withdrawal, or for continued use to alleviate negative affect.

===Model of impulsivity===
The model of [[impulsivity]] states that individuals high in impulsivity are at greater risk of addictive behaviours. The model proposes a two dimensional trait characteristic for the initiation and continuation of substance/behavioural abuse:
*'''Reward Drive (RD)''' - reflects individual differences in sensitivities to incentive motivation and engagement of addictive behaviour when reward cues are detected.<ref name="Dawe">{{cite journal | author = Dawe S, Loxton NJ | title = The role of impulsivity in the development of substance use and eating disorders | journal = Neurosci Biobehav Rev | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 343–51 | year = 2004 | month = May | pmid = 15225976 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2004.03.007 }}</ref>
*'''Rash Impulsiveness (RI)''' - reflecting individual differences in the ability to modify the addictive behaviour due to negative consequences.<ref name="Dawe"/> Individuals high in RI are oblivious or insensitive to the negative consequences as a result of addictive behaviour when engagement is craved.
Both high RD and RI individuals are found to have difficulty in making decisions that have future consequences. Individuals high in RD experience greater reinforcement when initially engaging in the addictive behaviour, and experience stronger conditioned associations with continued use. Individuals high in RI experience greater difficulty resisting [[craving (withdrawal)|craving]]s even in the face of negative consequences.<ref name="Dawe"/> Some moderators of RD and RI on the severity of addiction are stress and [[negative affect]] (such as feeling depressed).<ref name="pmid11120394">{{cite journal | author = Koob GF, Le Moal M | title = Drug addiction, dysregulation of reward, and allostasis | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 97–129 | year = 2001 | month = February | pmid = 11120394 | doi = 10.1016/S0893-133X(00)00195-0 }}</ref> That is, individuals high in RD/RI who also experience high levels of negative affect or stress, present more severe addictive behaviours. For example, if an individual is experiencing emotional distress, the distress experienced may lessen impulse control if they believe that engaging in addictive behaviour will decrease negative affect. According to this model, adolescents who are high in RI are at greater risk for developing addictions. Interestingly, low RI has been shown to moderate some of the risk of addiction due to family history.<ref name="pmid10624731">{{cite journal | author = Brook JS, Kessler RC, Cohen P | title = The onset of marijuana use from preadolescence and early adolescence to young adulthood | journal = Dev.

===Cloninger's tri-dimensional personality theory===
Cloninger's Tri-Dimensional Personality Theory states that personality comprises three genetically independent dimensions:<ref name="cloninger">{{cite journal | author = Cloninger CR | title = A systematic method for clinical description and classification of personality variants. A proposal | journal = Arch. Gen. Psychiatry | volume = 44 | issue = 6 | pages = 573–88 | year = 1987 | month = June | pmid = 3579504 | doi =10.1001/archpsyc.1987.01800180093014 }}</ref> 
* [[Novelty seeking]] (NS) - tendency towards exploration and intense exhilaration in response to novel stimuli
* [[Harm avoidance]] (HA) - intense response to adverse stimuli and learned inhibited behaviour to avoid punishment
* [[Reward dependence]] (RD) - resistance to extinction of previously rewarded behaviour.
Each personality dimension lies on a spectrum ranging from low to high. For example, individuals high in NS are impulsive, while individual's low in NS are reflective. Interactions between each of these three personality dimensions lead to different responses to novelty, punishment and rewards.<ref name="cloninger"/>

This model was extended to alcohol use disorders proposing that individuals with alcohol use disorders have extreme temperaments (i.e. are very high or very low in NS, HA, and RD).<ref name="pmid8979213">{{cite journal | author = Howard MO, Kivlahan D, Walker RD | title = Cloninger's tridimensional theory of personality and psychopathology: applications to substance use disorders | journal = J.

'''Type II alcoholics''' have an earlier onset of alcohol-related problems, less ability to abstain from alcohol, more frequent alcohol-related antisocial behaviour, less loss of control once drinking commenced, and less guilt or fear associated with drinking.<ref name="cloningers"/> These individuals are high in NS, and low in HA and RD, which means they may be typically aggressive, impulsive, active, talkative, and impatient.<ref name="cloningers"/>

== Criticism of the addiction model ==
In the mid-20th century critics of the addiction model, notably [[Thomas Szasz]], claimed that the concept of addiction was not normatively neutral, but inherently included a normative component that was arguably out of place in scientific discourse. Szasz cited, for example, Goodman and Gilman's ''The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics'', which defined "drug abuse" as "the use, usually by self-administration, of any drug in a manner that deviates from the approved medical or social patterns within a given culture."<ref name="Thomas Szasz 1974 p. 9">Thomas Szasz, ''Ceremonial Chemistry'' (1974), p. 9</ref> In investigating the history of the word "addiction," Szasz found that until the 20th century, the term meant "simply a strong inclination toward certain kinds of conduct, with little or no pejorative meaning attached to it."<ref name="Thomas Szasz 1974 p. 6">Thomas Szasz, ''Ceremonial Chemistry'' (1974), p. 6</ref> The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' included examples of addiction "to civil affairs" and "to useful reading."<ref name="Thomas Szasz 1974 p. 6"/> Szasz observed that the term transformed over time into a "stigmatizing label" with "pejorative meaning."<ref>Thomas Szasz, ''Ceremonial Chemistry'' (1974), p. 7</ref> Szasz drew an analogy between this stigmatization of minority psychopharmacological habits and the stigmatization of minority sexual habits<blockquote>Just as socially disapproved pharmacological behavior constitutes "drug abuse," and is officially recognized as an illness by a medical profession that is a licensed agency of the state, so socially disapproved sexual behavior constitutes a "perversion" and is also officially recognized as an illness; and so, more generally, socially disapproved personal behavior of any kind constitutes "mental illness."<ref name="Thomas Szasz 1974 p. 9"/></blockquote>

Szasz's views were criticized for failing to account for the effect of physiological dependence.<ref>See, for example, David M. Warburton, ''Addiction Controversies'' (1992).</ref>
