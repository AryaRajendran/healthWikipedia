A '''health care provider''' is an individual or an institution that provides preventive, curative, promotional, or rehabilitative [[health care]] services in a systematic way to individuals, families or communities.

An individual health care provider (also known as a '''health worker''') may be a health care professional within [[medicine]], [[nursing]], or a field of [[allied health]].  Health care providers may also be a  [[Public health|public]]/[[community health]] professional.  Institutions (also known as '''health facilities''') include [[hospital]]s, [[clinic]]s, [[primary care]] centres, and other service delivery points. The practice of health professionals and operation of health care institutions is typically [[Regulation|regulated]] by national or state/provincial authorities through appropriate regulatory bodies for purposes of [[quality assurance]].<ref>World Health Organization, 2003. ''Quality and accreditation in health care services''. Geneva http://www.who.int/hrh/documents/en/quality_accreditation.pdf</ref> Together, they form part of an overall [[health care system]].

== Medical facility == 
{{main|Medical facility}}

A '''medical facility''' is, in general, any location at which [[medicine]] is practiced regularly. Medical facilities range from small [[clinic]]s and [[doctor's office]]s to [[urgent care]] centers and large [[hospital]]s with elaborate [[emergency room]]s and [[trauma center]]s. The number and quality of medical facilities in a [[country]] or region is one common measure of that area's [[prosperity]] and [[quality of life]]. In many countries, medical facilities are [[regulation|regulated]] to some extent by [[health law|law]]; [[licensing]] by a regulatory agency is often required before a facility may open for business. Medical facilities may be owned and operated by [[business|for-profit business]]es, [[non-profit organization]]s, [[government]]s, and in some cases by [[individual]]s, with proportions varying by country.

== Practitioners and professionals ==
{{health pro}}
Health care practitioners include [[physician]]s, [[dentist]]s, [[pharmacist]]s (including clinical pharmacists), [[physician assistant]]s, [[nurse]]s (including [[advanced practice registered nurse]]s), [[Midwifery|midwives]], [[dietitian]]s, [[therapist]]s, [[psychologist]]s, [[Chiropractic|chiropractors]], [[clinical officer]]s, [[Phlebotomy|phlebotomists]], [[Physical therapy|physical therapists]], [[respiratory therapist]]s, [[occupational therapist]]s, [[audiologist]]s, [[speech pathologist]]s, [[Optometry|optometrists]], [[emergency medical technician]]s, [[paramedic]]s, [[medical laboratory scientist]]s, medical prosthetic technicians, radiographers, social workers, and a wide variety of other [[Health Human Resources|human resources]] trained to provide some type of health care service. They often work in hospitals, health care centres, and other service delivery points, but also in academic training, research, and administration. Some provide care and treatment services for patients in private homes. Many countries have a large number of [[community health worker]]s who work outside of formal health care institutions. [[Health administration|Managers of health care services]], [[Health information management|health information technicians]], and other [[unlicensed assistive personnel|assistive personnel]] and support workers are also considered a vital part of health care teams.<ref>World Health Organization, 2006. ''World Health Report 2006: working together for health.'' Geneva: WHO.</ref>

Health care practitioners are commonly grouped into four key fields:
#[[Medical]] (including generalist practitioners and specialists);
#[[Nursing]] (including various professional titles);
#[[Dentistry]];
#[[Health Professions]], including [[occupational therapy]], [[pharmacy]], [[physical therapy]], [[paramedicine]], [[respiratory therapy]], and many others health specialists.

Within each field, practitioners are often classified according to skill level and skill specialization. “Health professionals” are highly skilled workers, in professions that usually require extensive knowledge including university-level study leading to the award of a first degree or higher qualification.<ref>World Health Organization, 2010. ''Classifying health workers''. Geneva http://www.who.int/hrh/statistics/Health_workers_classification.pdf</ref> This category includes physicians, physician assistants, dentists, registered nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, optometrists, and others. Allied health professionals, also referred to as "health associate professionals" in the [[International Standard Classification of Occupations]], support implementation of health care, treatment and referral plans usually established by medical, nursing, and other health professionals, and usually require formal qualifications to practice their profession. In addition, [[unlicensed assistive personnel]] assist with providing health care services as permitted.

Another way to categorize health care practitioners is according to the sub-field in which they practice, such as mental health care, pregnancy and childbirth care, surgical care, rehabilitation care, or public health.

==Practice conditions and regulations ==

=== Shortages of health professionals ===
{{See also|Health workforce|Doctor shortage|Nursing shortage}}
Many jurisdictions report shortfalls in the number of trained [[Health Human Resources|health human resources]] to meet population health needs and/or service delivery targets, especially in medically underserved areas. For example, in the United States, the [[2010 United States federal budget|2010 federal budget]] invested $330 million to increase the number of doctors, nurses, and dentists practicing in areas of the country experiencing shortages of health professionals. The Budget expands [[loan]] repayment programs for physicians, nurses, and dentists who agree to practice in medically underserved areas. This funding will enhance the capacity of [[nursing school]]s to increase the number of nurses. It will also allow states to increase access to [[oral health care]] through dental workforce development [[Grant (money)|grant]]s. The Budget’s new resources will sustain the expansion of the health care workforce funded in the [[Recovery Act]].<ref>http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/fy2010_new_era/A_New_Era_of_Responsibility2.pdf</ref>

In Canada, the 2011 federal budget announced a [[Student loans in Canada|Canada Student Loan]] forgiveness programme to encourage and support new family physicians, nurse practitioners and nurses to practise in underserved rural or remote communities of the country, including communities that provide health services to [[First Nations]] and [[Inuit]] populations.<ref>Government of Canada. 2011. [http://www.actionplan.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=4122 ''Canada's Economic Action Plan'']: ''Forgiving Loans for New Doctors and Nurses in Under-Served Rural and Remote Areas''. Ottawa, 22 March 2011. Accessed 23 March 2011.</ref>

In Uganda, the [[Ministry of Health (Uganda)|Ministry of Health]] reports that as many as 50% of staffing positions for health workers in rural and underserved areas remain vacant. As of early 2011, the Ministry was conducting research and costing analyses to determine the most appropriate attraction and retention packages for medical officers, nursing officers, pharmacists, and laboratory technicians in the country’s rural areas.<ref>Rockers P et al. [http://www.capacityplus.org/determining-priority-retention-packages ''Determining Priority Retention Packages to Attract and Retain Health Workers in Rural and Remote Areas in Uganda''.] CapacityPlus Project. February 2011.</ref>

At the international level, the [[World Health Organization]] estimates a shortage of almost 4.3 million doctors, midwives, nurses, and support workers worldwide to meet target coverage levels of essential primary health care interventions.<ref>World Health Organization, 2006. ''The World Health Report 2006 - Working together for health''. Geneva: WHO http://www.who.int/whr/2006/en/index.html</ref> The shortage is reported most severe in 57 of the poorest countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.

=== Health and stress among health care practitioners ===
Some studies suggest that [[workplace stress]] is pervasive in the health care industry because of [[Health Human Resources|inadequate staffing levels]], [[working time|long work hours]], exposure to [[infectious diseases]] and [[hazardous substances]] leading to illness or death, and in some countries threat of [[malpractice]] litigation. According to a report from the United States' [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], "health care workers have higher rates of [[substance abuse]] and [[suicide]] than other professions and elevated rates of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[anxiety]] linked to job stress." Elevated levels of stress were also linked to high rates of [[burnout (psychology)|burnout]], [[absenteeism]] and diagnostic errors, and to reduced rates of [[patient]] satisfaction.<ref> National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). [http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2008-136/default.html ''Exposure to Stress: Occupational Hazards in Hospitals.''] NIOSH Publication No. 2008–136. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, July 2008. Retrieved on December 2, 2008.</ref> In Canada, a national report [[Canada's Health Care providers, 2007|''Canada's Health Care Providers'']] also indicated higher rates of absenteeism due to illness or disability among health care workers compared to the rest of the working population, although those working in health care reported similar levels of good health and fewer reports of being injured at work.<ref>Canadian Institute for Health Information. [https://secure.cihi.ca/estore/productSeries.htm?pc=PCC56 ''Canada's Health Care Providers, 2007''.] Ottawa, 2007.</ref>

Female health care workers may face specific types of workplace-related health conditions and stress. According to the [[World Health Organization]], women predominate in the formal health workforce in many countries, and are prone to [[musculoskeletal injury]] (caused by physically demanding job tasks such as lifting and moving patients) and burnout. Female health workers are exposed to hazardous drugs and chemicals in the workplace which may cause adverse reproductive outcomes such as [[Miscarriage|spontaneous abortion]] and [[congenital disorder|congenital malformations]]. In some contexts, female health workers are also subject to gender-based violence including from coworkers and patients.<ref>World Health Organization. [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241563857_eng.pdf ''Women and health: today's evidence, tomorrow's agenda''.] Geneva, 2009. Retrieved on March 9, 2011.</ref>

=== Practicing without a license ===
{{Main|Healthcare provider requisites}}

[[Practicing without a license]] that is valid and current is typically illegal. In most jurisdictions, the provision of health care services is regulated by government, and individuals found to be providing medical, nursing or other professional services without the appropriate certification or licence may face sanctions including even criminal charges leading to prison. The number of professions subject to regulation, [[Healthcare provider requisites|requisites for individuals to receive professional licensure]], and nature of sanctions that can be imposed for failure to comply vary across jurisdictions.

For instance, in the United States, under [[Michigan]] state laws, an individual is guilty of a felony if found to be practicing a health profession subject to regulation without a valid license or registration of their own, or exceeding what a limited license or registration allows. The state laws define the [[scope of practice]] for medicine, nursing, and a number of allied health professions.<ref>wiki.bmezine.com --> Practicing Medicine. In turn citing [[Michigan laws]]</ref> In Florida, practicing medicine without the appropriate license is a crime classified as a third degree felony,<ref name=flrules>[http://laws.flrules.org/files/Ch_2004-256.pdf CHAPTER 2004-256 Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 1118] State of Florida, Department of State.</ref> which may give imprisonment up to five years. Practicing a health care profession without a license which results in serious bodily injury classifies as a second degree felony,<ref name=flrules/> providing up to 15 years' imprisonment.

In the United Kingdom, healthcare professionals are regulated by the state; the UK [[Health Professions Council]] (HPC)<ref>http://www.hpc-uk.org/</ref> protects the 'title' of each profession it regulates. For example, it is illegal for someone to call themself an Occupational Therapist or Radiographer if they are not on the register held by the HPC.
