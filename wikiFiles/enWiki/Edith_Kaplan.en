'''Edith F. Kaplan''' (February 16, 1924 – September 3, 2009) was an [[United States|American]] [[psychologist]]. She was a pioneer of [[neuropsychological test]]s and did most of her work at the [[VA Boston Healthcare System|Boston VA Hospital]].<ref>{{cite book

Kaplan is known for her promotion of [[clinical neuropsychology]] as a specialty area in psychology. She examined brain-behavioral relationships in [[aphasia]], [[apraxia]], developmental issues in clinical neuropsychology, as well as normal and abnormal [[aging]]. Kaplan helped develop a new method of assessing brain function with [[neuropsychological assessment]], called the "[[Boston process approach]]."<ref>{{cite book

As a graduate student Kaplan worked with [[Heinz Werner (psychologist)|Heinz Werner]], and then collaborated further with [[Norman Geschwind]] and [[Harold Goodglass]].

==Personal history==
Kaplan was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. She earned her bachelor's degree at [[Brooklyn College]], then did her graduate work at [[Clark University]] in Worcester, with a dissertation focusing on the development of word meanings and [[apraxia]] in children.

Kaplan was a Professor in the departments of Neurology and Psychiatry, and in the Behavioral Neuroscience Ph.D. Program at [[Boston University]] School of Medicine at the time of her death. Kaplan was also Professor of Psychology at [[Suffolk University]] and Affiliate Professor of Psychology at Clark University. She was also a member of the Psychology Department at the [[Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care|Baycrest Hospital]] in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

==Mentorship==
Kaplan was a leader in developing education and training of neuropsychologists. From 1976 to 1987, Kaplan was the director of Clinical Neuropsychological Services at the Boston Veterans Administration Medical Center where she was responsible for the development of pre- and post-doctoral clinical neuropsychological internship training program. Later, at Suffolk University, Boston University School of Medicine, and [[Tewksbury Hospital]], she continued this work. She also did philanthropic work with the [[National Head Injury Foundation]] and the [[World Health Organization]].

==Clinical contributions==
Kaplan made important contributions to clinical [[neuropsychological assessment]]. Her observations and assessment methods evolved into a philosophical school of neuropsychological assessment, called by most people the "Boston Process Approach."<ref>{{cite book

Kaplan also re-purposed [[intelligence tests]] such as the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]] as tools to localize functional deficits in the brain (whether developmental or due to [[lesion]]s).

Prior to the introduction of the process-oriented approach, clinical neuropsychological assessment followed a fixed-battery global-achievement approach, and stressed quantitative interpretation of test results (for example the [[Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Battery|Halstead-Reitan]] battery). The process-oriented approach offered advances in test interpretation, stressing the qualitative aspects of patients' performance profiles. The Boston Process Approach examines the qualitative process by which the patient solves a problem rather than simply looking at the patient's quantitative numerical scores. The Boston Process also tailors which tests to give a patient instead of administering an entire test battery to every subject, regardless of their condition. This alternative approach improved clinical understanding  of brain functions and generated discussion about diagnostic issues in clinical neuropsychology.<ref>{{cite book

She also investigated [[Parkinson's disease]], [[schizophrenia]], [[dementia]], and other [[neuropsychological disorder]]s.

==Professional achievements and awards==
Kaplan was one of the founders of the [[American Board of Clinical Neuropsychology]] and was among the first to be awarded the Diplomat in Clinical Neuropsychology.  Kaplan was president of the [[International Neuropsychological Society]], president of the Clinical Neuropsychology Division of the [[American Psychological Association]] ([[Division of Clinical Neuropsychology|Division 40]]), and president of the Boston Neuropsychological Foundation, which she co-founded in 1983. 

She received many awards, including The National Academy of Neuropsychology Distinguished Clinical Neuropsychologist Award in 1993, The Edith Kaplan Neuroscience Scholarship Fund in 1994, and The New England Psychological Association first annual Distinguished Contributions Award in 1996. She also won The Massachusetts Psychological Association Career Contribution Award in 1998 and The Massachusetts Neuropsychological Society Career Contribution Award in 1999. Kaplan had one son.
