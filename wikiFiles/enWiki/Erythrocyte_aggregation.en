'''Erythrocyte aggregation''' is the reversible clumping of these cells under low shear forces or at stasis. [[Erythrocyte]]s aggregate in a special way, forming [[rouleaux]]. Rouleaux are stacks of erythrocytes which form because of the unique discoid shape of the cells in [[vertebrate]] body. The flat surface of the discoid RBCs give them a large surface area to make contact and stick to each other; thus, forming a rouleaux. Rouleaux formation takes place only in suspensions of RBC containing high-molecular, fibrilar proteins or polymers in the suspending medium. The most important protein causing rouleaux formation in plasma is fibrinogen. RBC suspended in simple salt solutions do not form rouleaux.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Chien S, Sung LA |title= Physicochemical basis and clinical implications of red cell aggregation |journal=Clinical Hemorheology |volume=7 |pages=71–91 |year=1987 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/0026-2862(73)90068-X |author= Chien S, Jan KM |title= Ultrastructural basis of the mechanism of rouleaux formation|journal=Microvascular Research |volume=5 |issue= 2 |pages=155–66 |year=1973 |pmid= 4694282 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author= Mesielman HJ |title= Red blood cell role in RBC aggregation: 1963-1993 and beyond |journal=Clinical Hemorheology |volume=13 |pages=575–592 |year=1993 }}</ref>

==Mechanism==
Erythrocyte aggregation is a physiological phenomenon that takes places in normal blood under low-flow conditions or at stasis. The presence or increased concentrations of acute phase proteins, particularly [[fibrinogen]], results in enhanced erythrocyte aggregation. 

Current experimental and theoretical evidence supports the mechanism related to the depletion of high-molecular weight molecules (e.g., [[fibrinogen]]) for rouleau formation.<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/S0006-3495(02)75259-4 |author= Neu B, Meiselman HJ |title= Depletion-mediated red blood cell aggregation in polymer solutions |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=83 |issue= 5 |pages=2482–2490 |year=2002 |pmid= 12414682 |pmc= 1302334 }}</ref> This mechanism is also known as “chemiosmotic hypothesis” for aggregation.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Meiselman HJ |title= Red blood cell aggregation: 45 years being curious |journal=Biorheology |volume=46 |issue= 1 |pages=1–19 |year=2009 |pmid= 19252224 |doi= 10.3233/BIR-2009-0522 }}</ref>
Erythrocyte aggregation is determined by both suspending phase ([[blood plasma]]) and cellular properties. Surface properties of erythrocytes, such as [[surface charge density]] strongly influence the extent and time course of aggregation.

==Effects==
Erythrocyte aggregation is the main determinant of blood viscosity at low shear rate. Rouleau formation also determines [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] which is a non-specific indicator of the presence of disease.<ref>Oxford Textbook of Medicine</ref>

Influence of erythrocyte aggregation on in vivo blood flow is still a controversial issue.<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1080/10739680802107447 |author= Baskurt OK,  Meiselman HJ |title= RBC Aggregation: More Important than RBC Adhesion to Endothelial Cells as a Determinant of ''In Vivo'' Blood Flow in Health and Disease |journal=Microcirculation |volume=15 |issue= 7 |pages=585–590 |year=2008 |pmid= 18608991 }}</ref> Enhanced aggregation affects venous hemodynamics.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Cabel M, Meiselman HJ, Popel AS, Johnson PC

==Causes==
Conditions which cause increased rouleaux formation include [[infections]], [[inflammation|inflammatory]] and [[connective tissue]] disorders, and [[cancers]]. It also occurs in [[diabetes mellitus]] and is one of the causative factors for microvascular occlusion in [[diabetic retinopathy]]. 

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate closely reflects the extent of aggregation, therefore can be used as a measure of aggregation. Erythroyte aggregation can also be quantitated by monitoring optical properties of blood during the time course of aggregation process.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Baskurt OK, Uyuklu M, Ulker P, et al. |title= Comparison of three instruments for measuring red blood cell aggregation |journal=Clinical Hemorheology and Microcirculation |volume=43 |issue= 4|pages=283–298 |year=2009 |pmid= 19996518 |doi= 10.3233/CH-2009-1240 }}</ref>
