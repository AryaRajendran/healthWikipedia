'''''Bloodless surgery''''' is a phrase that was popularized at the beginning of the 20th century by the practice of an internationally famous [[Orthopedic surgery|orthopedic surgeon]], [[Adolf Lorenz]], who was known as "the bloodless surgeon of [[Vienna]]".<ref>''The New York Times'' Oct 26, 1902 p 7</ref><ref>''The New York Times'' Sep 10, 1906 p 1</ref><ref>New York Times Dec 25, 1902 p 3</ref><ref>New York Times Nov 22, 1926 p 3</ref> This expression reflected Lorenz's methods for treating patients with noninvasive techniques. His medical practice was a consequence of his severe [[allergy]] to [[carbolic acid]] routinely used in [[Operating theatre|operating rooms]] of the era. His condition forced him to become a "dry surgeon".<ref>Jackson et al., Baylor University Medical Center Proceedings, January 2004; 17(1): 3–7.</ref>

Contemporary usage of ''bloodless surgery'' refers to both invasive and noninvasive medical techniques and protocols. The phrase is somewhat confusing.<ref>Farmer S, Webb D, Your Body Your Choice The layman's complete guide to bloodless medicine and surgery, 2000 pgs. Preface, 11, 16.</ref> The expression does not mean "[[surgery]] that makes no use of blood or [[blood transfusion]]". Rather, it refers to surgery performed without transfusion of [[Allograft|allogeneic]] blood.<ref>Farmer S, Webb D, Your Body Your Choice The layman's complete guide to bloodless medicine and surgery, 2000 pg. 11, 14, 75.</ref><ref>Dailey, John F, Dailey's Notes on Blood Fourth Edition, 2002 pg. 198.</ref> Champions of bloodless surgery do, however, transfuse products made from allogeneic blood and they also make use of pre-donated blood for autologous transfusion.<ref>Farmer S, Webb D, Your Body Your Choice The layman's complete guide to bloodless medicine and surgery, 2000 pg. 144-5.</ref> The last twenty years have witnessed a surge of interest in bloodless surgery, for a variety of reasons. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] [[Jehovah's Witnesses and blood transfusions|reject blood transfusions]] on religious grounds; others may be concerned about [[Hematology|bloodborne diseases]], such as [[hepatitis]] and [[AIDS]].

During the early 1960s, American heart surgeon [[Denton Cooley]] successfully performed numerous bloodless open-heart surgeries on [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]] patients. Fifteen years later, he and his associate published a report<ref>Ott DA, Cooley DA. Cardiovascular surgery in Jehovah's Witnesses. Report of 542 operations without blood transfusion. JAMA. 1977;232:1256-1258.</ref> of more than 500 cardiac surgeries in this population, documenting that cardiac surgery could be safely performed without [[blood transfusion]].

[[Ron Lapin|Ronald Lapin]] (1941–1995) was a maverick Israeli-born American surgeon, who became interested in bloodless surgery in the mid 1970s. He was known as a "bloodless surgeon" due to his willingness to perform surgeries on severely anemic [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]] patients without the use of [[blood transfusions]].

==Principles of bloodless surgery==

Several principles of bloodless surgery have been published.<ref>Goher et al., Ann R Coll Surg Engl 2005; 87: 3–14.</ref>

Preoperative techniques such as [[erythropoietin]] (EPO) or iron administration are designed to stimulate the patient's own [[erythropoiesis]].

In surgery, control of bleeding is achieved with the use of laser or sonic scalpels, [[minimally invasive]] surgical techniques, electrocautery, low central venous pressure anesthesia (for select cases), or suture ligation of vessels.<ref name="Magner">{{cite journal |last=Magner |first=David |authorlink= |coauthors=Ouellette, James R.; Lee, Joseph R.; Colquhoun, Steven; Lo, Simon; Nissen, Nicholas N. |year=2006 |month=May |title=Pancreaticoduodenectomy after neoadjuvant therapy in a Jehovah's witness with locally advanced pancreatic cancer: case report and approach to avoid transfusion. |journal=The American surgeon |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=435–437 |id= |pmid=16719200}}</ref>  Other methods include the use of [[blood substitutes]], which at present do not carry oxygen but expand the volume of the blood to prevent [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]. Blood substitutes which do carry oxygen, such as [[PolyHeme]], are also under development.  Many doctors view acute normovolemic hemodilution, a form of storage of a patient's own blood, as a pillar of "bloodless surgery" but the technique is not an option for patients who refuse autologous [[blood transfusions]].

[[Intraoperative blood salvage]] is a technique which recycles and cleans blood from a patient during an operation and redirects it into the patient's body.

Postoperatively, surgeons seek to minimize further blood loss by continuing administration of medications to augment blood cell mass and minimizing the number of blood draws and the quantity of blood drawn for testing, for example, by using pediatric blood tubes for adult patients.<ref name="Magner"/>
HBOC's such as Polyheme and Hemepure have been discontinued due to severe adverse reactions including death. South Africa was the only country where they were legally authorized as standard treatment but they are no longer available.

==Benefits==

Bloodless medicine appeals to many doctors because it carries low risk of post-operative infection when compared with procedures requiring [[blood transfusion]]. Additionally, it may be economically beneficial in some countries. For example, the cost of blood in the [[United States|US]] hovers around $500 a unit ( Feb 2012 Red Cross charges $700/unit - according to union rep in OH and hospitals' cost is about $1000 to $1500/unit- real cost is usually 5 times these amounts when everything is added in ), including testing.<ref>Time Magazine, Bloodless Surgery, by John Langone, October 1997; page 5 [http://www.time.com/time/reports/heroes/bloodless.html].</ref> These costs are further increased as, according to Jan Hoffman (an administrator for the blood conservation program at [[Geisinger Medical Center]] in [[Danville, Pennsylvania]]), hospitals must pick up the tab for the first three units of blood infused per patient per calendar year. By contrast, hospitals may be reimbursed for drugs that boost a patient's red blood cell count, a treatment approach often used before and after surgery to reduce the need for a [[blood transfusion]]. Geisinger Medical Center began a blood conservation program in 2005 and reported a recorded savings of $273,000 in its first six months of operation.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2006/03/27/story8.html?page=2 | first=Kris B. | last=Mamula | title='Bloodless' surgical program attracts new patients to AGH | date=27 March 2006}}</ref>
John Hopkins lowered their direct costs from $35.5 million in 2009 to $25.4 million in 2012 -a saving of $10 million a year.<sup><ref>18</ref></sup>

Health risks appear to be another contributing factor in their appeal, especially in light of recent studies that suggest that [[blood transfusions]] can increase the risk of complications and reduce survival rates.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21449243 The team focus on improving blood transfusion.]</ref><ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22901922 Early death and late morbidity after blood transfusion of injured children: a pilot study.]</ref> Thus the recovery rate is faster with bloodless surgery allowing the patient to leave earlier.

==Risks==
In cases where a significant amount of blood is lost, an unwillingness to transfuse a patient could lead to exsanguination and death. This is especially true when doctors have little or no knowledge or desire to learn severe bloodless trauma techniques.<sup>[17]</sup> Sometimes there is nothing that can be done.
