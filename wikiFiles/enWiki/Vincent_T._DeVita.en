DeVita, Jr., MD Honored by ASCO], ''Webwire'' (press release), Retrieved October 28, 2010</ref> 

DeVita spent the early part of his career at the National Cancer Institute ([[NCI]]). In 1980, the president of the United States appointed him as director of the NCI and the National Cancer Program,<ref name="cancer1">Greenberg, Daniel S. [http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM198010233031744 A Conversation with Vincent T. DeVita, Jr., M.D.], ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'',  1980; 303:1014-1016, Retrieved October 28, 2010</ref> a position he held until 1988. While at the NCI, he was instrumental in developing combination chemotherapy programs that ultimately led to an effective regimen of curative chemotherapy for [[Hodgkin's disease]] and diffuse large cell [[lymphoma]]s. Along with colleagues at the NCI, he developed the four-drug combination, known by the [[acronym]] [[MOPP (medicine)|MOPP]], which increased the cure rate for patients with advanced Hodgkin's disease from nearly zero to over 70%. 

In addition, in collaboration with Dr. [[George Canellos]], DeVita developed the combination chemotherapy [[Cyclophosphamide Methotrexate Fluorouracil|CMF]], which still remains a useful therapy for [[breast cancer]]. 

DeVita was the Director of [[Yale Cancer Center]] from 1993 to 2003. He is currently the chair of the Yale Cancer Center advisory board and is professor of [[internal medicine]] and of [[epidemiology]] and [[public health]] at [[Yale School of Medicine|Yale's medical school]]. 

DeVita currently serves on the editorial boards of numerous scientific journals and is the author or co-author of more than 450 scientific articles. He is one of the three editors of ''Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology'' and serves as the editor-in-chief of ''The Cancer Journal''.

== Personal ==

Vincent DeVita diagnosed his son [[Ted DeVita|Ted]] as a child with [[aplastic anemia]]. Ted thereafter was placed in a sterile environment for his safety, and died in 1980 at the age of 17. Ted's [[boy in the bubble|situation]], and that of [[David Vetter]], inspired the 1976 TV movie ''[[The Boy in the Plastic Bubble]]'' starring [[John Travolta]].
