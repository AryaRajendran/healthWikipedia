[[File:Symptoms of multiple sclerosis.png|thumb|right|250px|Main symptoms of multiple sclerosis.]]
'''[[Multiple sclerosis]]''' can cause a variety of symptoms: changes in sensation ([[hypoesthesia]]), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, or difficulty moving; difficulties with coordination and balance; problems in speech ([[dysarthria]]) or swallowing ([[dysphagia]]), visual problems ([[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], [[optic neuritis]], [[phosphene]]s or [[diplopia]]), [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and acute or chronic pain syndromes, [[urinary bladder|bladder]] and [[bowel]] difficulties, [[cognitive]] impairment, or emotional symptomatology (mainly [[major depressive disorder|major depression]]). The main clinical measure in progression of the disability and severity of the symptoms is the [[Expanded Disability Status Scale]] or EDSS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kurtzke JF |title=Rating neurologic impairment in multiple sclerosis: an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) |journal=Neurology |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=1444–52 |year=1983 |pmid=6685237 |doi=}}</ref>

The initial attacks are often transient, mild (or asymptomatic), and self-limited. They often do not prompt a health care visit and sometimes are only identified in retrospect once the diagnosis has been made after further attacks. The most common initial symptoms reported are: changes in sensation in the arms, legs or face (33%), complete or partial vision loss ([[optic neuritis]]) (20%), weakness (13%), [[diplopia|double vision]] (7%), unsteadiness when walking (5%), and balance problems (3%); but many rare initial symptoms have been reported such as [[aphasia]] or [[psychosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Navarro S, Mondéjar-Marín B, Pedrosa-Guerrero A, Pérez-Molina I, Garrido-Robres J, Alvarez-Tejerina A |title=[Aphasia and parietal syndrome as the presenting symptoms of a demyelinating disease with pseudotumoral lesions] |journal=Rev Neurol |volume=41 |issue=10 |pages=601–3 |year= 2005|pmid=16288423}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Jongen P |title=Psychiatric onset of multiple sclerosis |journal=J Neurol Sci |volume=245 |issue=1–2 |pages=59–62 |year=2006 |pmid=16631798 |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2005.09.014}}</ref> Fifteen percent of individuals have multiple symptoms when they first seek medical attention.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 8017875 | volume=36 Suppl | title=MS COSTAR: a computerized patient record adapted for clinical research purposes | year=1994 | author=Paty D, Studney D, Redekop K, Lublin F | journal=Ann.

==Bladder and bowel==
[[Urinary bladder|Bladder]] problems (See also [[urinary system]] and [[urination]]) appear in 70–80% of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and they have an important effect both on [[hygiene]] habits and social activity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hennessey A, Robertson NP, Swingler R, Compston DA |title=Urinary, faecal and sexual dysfunction in patients with multiple sclerosis |journal=J. Neurol. |volume=246 |issue=11 |pages=1027–32 |year=1999 |pmid=10631634 |doi=10.1007/s004150050508}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Burguera-Hernández JA |title=[Urinary alterations in multiple sclerosis] |language=Spanish; Castilian |journal=Revista de neurologia |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=989–92 |year=2000 |pmid=10919202}}</ref>
Bladder problems are usually related with high levels of [[disability]] and [[corticospinal tract|pyramidal]] signs in lower limbs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Betts CD, D'Mellow MT, Fowler CJ |title=Urinary symptoms and the neurological features of bladder dysfunction in multiple sclerosis |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=245–50 |year=1993 |pmid=8459239 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.56.3.245 |pmc=1014855}}</ref>

The most common problems are an increase in frequency and urgency ([[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]]) but difficulties to begin urination, hesitation, leaking, sensation of incomplete urination, and retention also appear. When retention occurs secondary [[urinary infection]]s are common.

There are many [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] and [[subcortical]] structures implicated in urination<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nour S, Svarer C, Kristensen JK, Paulson OB, Law I |title=Cerebral activation during micturition in normal men |journal=Brain |volume=123 |issue= 4|pages=781–9 |year=2000 |pmid=10734009 |doi=10.1093/brain/123.4.781}}</ref> and MS lesions in various [[central nervous system]] structures can cause these kind of symptoms.

Treatment objectives are the alleviation of symptoms of urinary dysfunction, treatment of urinary infections, reduction of complicating factors and the preservation of [[kidney|renal]] function. Treatments can be classified in two main subtypes: pharmacological and non-pharmacological.
Pharmacological treatments vary greatly depending on the origin or type of dysfunction and some examples of the medications used are:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ayuso-Peralta L, de Andrés C |title=[Symptomatic treatment of multiple sclerosis] |language=Spanish; Castilian |journal=Revista de neurologia |volume=35 |issue=12 |pages=1141–53 |year=2002 |pmid=12497297 |doi=}}</ref>

==Cognitive==

Some of the most common deficits affect recent [[memory]], [[attention]], processing speed, visual-spatial abilities and [[executive function]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bobholz J, Rao S |title=Cognitive dysfunction in multiple sclerosis: a review of recent developments |journal=Curr Opin Neurol |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=283–8 |year=2003 |pmid=12858063 |doi=10.1097/00019052-200306000-00006}}</ref> Symptoms related to cognition include [[labile affect|emotional instability]] and [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] including [[neurological fatigue]].

Measures of tissue atrophy are well correlated with, and predict, cognitive dysfunction. Neuropsychological outcomes are highly correlated with linear measures of sub-cortical atrophy. Cognitive impairment is the result of not only tissue damage, but tissue repair and adaptive functional reorganization.<ref name="pmid15228758">{{cite journal |author=Benedict RH, Carone DA, Bakshi R |title=Correlating brain atrophy with cognitive dysfunction, mood disturbances, and personality disorder in multiple sclerosis |journal=J Neuroimaging |volume=14 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=36S–45S |year=2004 |month=July |pmid=15228758 |doi=10.1177/1051228404266267 |url=}}</ref> [[Neuropsychological test]]ing is important for determining the extent of cognitive deficits.

==Emotional==
Emotional symptoms are also common and are thought to be both a normal response to having a debilitating disease and the result of damage to specific areas of the central nervous system that generate and control emotions. 

[[Clinical depression]] is the most common neuropsychiatric condition: lifetime depression prevalence rates of 40–50% and 12 month prevalence rates around 20% have been typically reported for samples of people with MS; these figures are considerably higher than those for the general population or for people with other chronic illnesses.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sadovnick A, Remick R, Allen J, Swartz E, Yee I, Eisen K, Farquhar R, Hashimoto S, Hooge J, Kastrukoff L, Morrison W, Nelson J, Oger J, Paty D |title=Depression and multiple sclerosis |journal=Neurology |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=628–32 |year=1996 |pmid=8618657}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Patten S, Beck C, Williams J, Barbui C, Metz L |title=Major depression in multiple sclerosis: a population-based perspective |journal=Neurology |volume=61 |issue=11 |pages=1524–7 |year=2003 |pmid=14663036}}</ref> Brain imaging studies have tried to relate depression to lesions in certain regions of the brain have met with variable success.

Other feelings such as [[anger]], [[anxiety]], [[frustration]], and hopelessness also appear frequently and [[suicide]] is a very real threat since it results in 15% of deaths in MS sufferers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sadovnick A, Eisen K, Ebers G, Paty D |title=Cause of death in patients attending multiple sclerosis clinics |journal=Neurology |volume=41 |issue=8 |pages=1193–6 |year=1991 |pmid=1866003}}</ref>

==Internuclear ophthalmoplegia==
[[File:Internuclear ophthalmoplegia.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''Schematic demonstrating right internuclear ophthalmoplegia, caused by injury of the right [[medial longitudinal fasciculus]] ]]
{{Main|Internuclear ophthalmoplegia}}

Internuclear ophthalmoplegia is a disorder of conjugate lateral gaze.  The affected eye shows impairment of [[adduction]].  The partner eye diverges from the affected eye during abduction, producing [[diplopia]]; during extreme abduction, compensatory [[physiologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] can be seen in the partner eye. Diplopia means double vision while nystagmus is involuntary [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]] characterized by alternating [[smooth pursuit]] in one direction and a [[saccadic movement]] in the other direction.

Internuclear ophthalmoplegia occurs when MS affects a part of the [[brain stem]] called the [[medial longitudinal fasciculus]], which is responsible for communication between the two eyes by connecting the [[abducens nucleus]] of one side to the [[oculomotor nucleus]] of the opposite side. This results in the failure of the [[medial rectus muscle]] to contract appropriately, so that the eyes do not move equally (called disconjugate gaze).

Different drugs as well as optic compensatory systems and prisms can be used to improve these symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leigh RJ, Averbuch-Heller L, Tomsak RL, Remler BF, Yaniglos SS, Dell'Osso LF |title=Treatment of abnormal eye movements that impair vision: strategies based on current concepts of physiology and pharmacology |journal=Ann.

==Mobility restrictions==
Restrictions in mobility (walking, transfers, bed mobility etc.) are common in individuals suffering from multiple sclerosis. Within 10 years after the onset of MS one-third of patients reach a score of 6 on the [[Expanded Disability Status Scale]] (EDSS), requiring the use of a unilateral walking aid, and by 30 years the proportion increases to 83%. Within five years of onset the EDSS is six in 50% of those with the progressive form of MS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weinshenker BG, Bass B, Rice GP, ''et al.'' |title=The natural history of multiple sclerosis: a geographically based study. I. Clinical course and disability |journal=Brain |volume=112 |issue= 1|pages=133–46 |year=1989 |pmid=2917275 |doi=}}</ref>
 
A wide range of impairments may exist in MS sufferers which can act either alone or in combination to impact directly on a person's balance, function and mobility. Such impairments include [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[Muscle weakness|weakness]], hypertonicity, low exercise tolerance, impaired [[Balance (ability)|balance]], [[ataxia]] and [[tremor]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Freeman JA |title=Improving mobility and functional independence in persons with multiple sclerosis |journal=J. Neurol. |volume=248 |issue=4 |pages=255–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11374088 |doi=10.1007/s004150170198}}</ref>

Interventions may be aimed at the individual impairments that reduce mobility or at the level of disability. This second level intervention includes provision, education, and instruction in the use of equipment such as walking aids, wheelchairs, [[motorized scooter]]s and car adaptations as well as instruction on compensatory strategies to accomplish an activity — for example undertaking safe transfers by pivoting in a flexed posture rather than standing up and stepping around.

==Optic neuritis==
{{Main|Optic neuritis}}
Up to 50% of patients with MS will develop an episode of optic neuritis and 20% of the time optic neuritis is the presenting sign of MS. The presence of demyelinating white matter lesions on brain [[MRI]]s at the time of presentation for optic neuritis is the strongest predictor in developing clinical diagnosis of MS. Almost half of the patients with optic neuritis have white matter lesions consistent with multiple sclerosis.

At five year follow-ups the overall risk of developing MS is 30%, with or without MRI lesions. Patients with a normal MRI still develop MS (16%), but at a lower rate compared to those patients with three or more MRI lesions (51%). From the other perspective, however, 44% of patients with any demyelinating lesions on MRI at presentation will not have developed MS ten years later.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beck RW, Trobe JD |title=What we have learned from the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial |journal=Ophthalmology |volume=102 |issue=10 |pages=1504–8 |year=1995 |pmid=9097798}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=The 5-year risk of MS after optic neuritis: experience of the optic neuritis treatment trial. 1997 |journal=Neurology |volume=57 |issue=12 Suppl 5 |pages=S36–45 |year=2001 |pmid=11902594}}</ref> 

Individuals experience rapid onset of pain in one eye followed by blurry [[Visual perception|vision]] in part or all its [[visual field]].

It is strong and debilitating and has a profound effect on the [[quality of life]] and [[mental health]] of the sufferer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Archibald CJ, McGrath PJ, Ritvo PG, ''et al.'' |title=Pain prevalence, severity and impact in a clinic sample of multiple sclerosis patients |journal=Pain |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=89–93 |year=1994 |pmid=7970843 |doi=10.1016/0304-3959(94)90188-0}}</ref> 
It usually appears after a lesion to the ascending or descending tracts that control the transmission of painful stimulus, such as the [[anterolateral system]], but many other causes are also possible.<ref name="Clanet MG, Brassat D 2000 263–70"/>
Most frequent pains reported are [[headache]]s (40%), [[Dysesthesia|dysesthetic]] limb pain (19%), back pain (17%), and painful [[spasm]]s (11%).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pöllmann W, Feneberg W, Erasmus LP |title=[Pain in multiple sclerosis—a still underestimated problem.

===Trigeminal neuralgia===
[[Trigeminal neuralgia]] (or "tic douloureux") is a disorder of the [[trigeminal nerve]] that causes episodes of intense pain in the eyes, lips, nose, scalp, forehead, and jaw, affecting 1–2% of MS patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brisman R |title=Trigeminal neuralgia and multiple sclerosis |journal=Arch. Neurol. |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=379–81 |year=1987 |pmid=3493757 |doi=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bayer DB, Stenger TG |title=Trigeminal neuralgia: an overview |journal=Oral Surg. Oral Med.

The episodes of pain occur paroxysmally (suddenly) and the patients describe it as trigger area on the face, so sensitive that touching or even air currents can bring an episode of pain. Usually it is successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as 
[[carbamazepine]],<ref name="nlm.nih.gov">[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a682237.html Information from the USA National library of medicine on carbamazepine]</ref> 
or [[phenytoin]]<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a682022.html Information from the USA National library of medicine on phenytoin]</ref>
although others such as [[gabapentin]]<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a694007.html Information from the USA National library of medicine on gabapentin]</ref> can be used.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Solaro C, Messmer Uccelli M, Uccelli A, Leandri M, Mancardi GL |title=Low-dose gabapentin combined with either lamotrigine or carbamazepine can be useful therapies for trigeminal neuralgia in multiple sclerosis |journal=Eur.

When drugs are not effective, surgery may be recommended. [[Glycerol rhizotomy]] (surgical injection of [[glycerol]] into a nerve) has been studied<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kondziolka D, Lunsford LD, Bissonette DJ |title=Long-term results after glycerol rhizotomy for multiple sclerosis-related trigeminal neuralgia |journal=The Canadian journal of neurological sciences. Le journal canadien des sciences neurologiques |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=137–40 |year=1994 |pmid=8087740 |doi=}}</ref>

===Lhermitte's sign===
[[Lhermitte's sign]] is an electrical sensation that runs down the back and into the limbs and is produced by bending the neck forwards. The sign suggests a lesion of the dorsal columns of the cervical cord or of the caudal [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]], correlating significantly with cervical [[MRI]] abnormalities.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gutrecht JA, Zamani AA, Slagado ED |title=Anatomic-radiologic basis of Lhermitte's sign in multiple sclerosis |journal=Arch. Neurol. |volume=50 |issue=8 |pages=849–51 |year=1993 |pmid=8352672 |doi=}}</ref>
Between 25 and 40% of MS patients report having Lhermitte's sign during the course of their illness.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Al-Araji AH, Oger J |title=Reappraisal of Lhermitte's sign in multiple sclerosis |journal=Mult.

===Dysesthesias===
[[Dysesthesias]] are  disagreeable sensations produced by ordinary [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. The abnormal sensations are caused by lesions of the peripheral or central sensory pathways, and are described as painful feelings such as burning, wetness, itching, electric shock or pins and needles. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond well to treatment with [[carbamazepine]], [[clonazepam]] or [[amitriptyline]].<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a682279.html Information from the USA National library of medicine on clonazepam]</ref><ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a682388.html Information from the USA National library of medicine on amitriptyline]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Moulin DE, Foley KM, Ebers GC |title=Pain syndromes in multiple sclerosis |journal=Neurology |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=1830–4 |year=1988 |pmid=2973568 |doi=}}</ref>

==Sexual==
[[Sexual dysfunction]] (SD) is one of many symptoms affecting persons with a diagnosis of MS.  SD in men encompasses both [[Erectile dysfunction|erectile]] and ejaculatory disorder.  The prevalence of SD in men with MS ranges from 75 to 91%.<ref>O'Leary et al., 2007</ref>  Erectile dysfunction appears to be the most common form of SD documented in MS. SD may be due to alteration of the ejaculatory reflex which can be affected by neurological conditions such as MS.<ref>O'Leary, M., Heyman, R., Erickson, J., Chancellor, M.B.: Premature ejaculation and MS: A Review, Consortium of MS Centers, http://www.mscare.org, June 2007</ref>

==Spasticity==
[[Spasticity]] is characterised by increased stiffness and slowness in limb movement, the development of certain postures, an association with weakness of voluntary muscle power, and with involuntary and sometimes painful [[spasm]]s of limbs.<ref name="isbn = 1-86016-182-0" /> A physiotherapist can help to reduce spasticity and avoid the development of [[contracture]]s with techniques such as [[passive stretching]].<ref name="pmid10871810">{{cite journal |author=Cardini RG, Crippa AC, Cattaneo D |title=Update on multiple sclerosis rehabilitation |journal=J.

==Transverse myelitis==
{{Main|Transverse myelitis}}

Some MS patients develop rapid onset of [[paresthesia|numbness]], weakness, [[bowel]] or [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] dysfunction, and/or loss of [[motor neuron|muscle]] function, typically in the lower half of the body.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} This is the result of MS attacking the [[spinal cord]]. The symptoms and signs depend upon the <!--''Needs clarifying'': the level of the spinal -->nerve cords involved and the extent of the involvement.

Prognosis for complete recovery is generally poor. Recovery from transverse myelitis usually begins between weeks 2 and 12 following onset and may continue for up to 2 years in some patients and as many as 80% of individuals with transverse myelitis are left with lasting disabilities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==Tremor and ataxia==
 {{Main|Tremor}}

[[Tremor]] is an unintentional, somewhat rhythmic, muscle movement involving to-and-fro movements (oscillations) of one or more parts of the body. It is the most common of all involuntary movements and can affect the hands, arms, head, face, vocal cords, trunk, and legs. 
[[Ataxia]] is an unsteady and clumsy motion of the limbs or torso due to a failure of the gross coordination of muscle movements. People with ataxia experience a failure of muscle control in their arms and legs, resulting in a lack of balance and coordination or a disturbance of [[Gait (human)|gait]].

Tremor and ataxia are frequent in MS and present in 25 to 60% of patients. They can be very disabling and embarrassing, and are difficult to manage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Koch M, Mostert J, Heersema D, De Keyser J |title=Tremor in multiple sclerosis |journal=J. Neurol. |volume=254 |issue=2 |pages=133–45 |year=2007 |pmid=17318714 |doi=10.1007/s00415-006-0296-7 |pmc=1915650}}</ref> The origin of tremor in MS is difficult to identify but it can be due to a mixture of different factors such as damage to the [[cerebellar]] connections, weakness, [[spasticity]], etc.

Many medications have been proposed to treat tremor; however their efficacy is very limited. Medications that have been reported to provide some relief are [[isoniazid]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bozek CB, Kastrukoff LF, Wright JM, Perry TL, Larsen TA |title=A controlled trial of isoniazid therapy for action tremor in multiple sclerosis |journal=J.

An example is the use of wrist bandages with weights, which can be useful to increase the [[inertia]] of movement and therefore reduce tremor.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aisen ML, Arnold A, Baiges I, Maxwell S, Rosen M |title=The effect of mechanical damping loads on disabling action tremor |journal=Neurology |volume=43 |issue=7 |pages=1346–50 |year=1993 |pmid=8327136 |doi=}}</ref> Daily use objects are also adapted so they are easier to grab and use. 

If all these measures fail patients are candidates for [[thalamus]] [[surgery]]. This kind of surgery can be both a [[thalamotomy]] or the implantation of a [[thalamic stimulator]]. Complications are frequent (30% in thalamotomy and 10% in deep brain stimulation) and include a worsening of ataxia, [[dysarthria]] and [[hemiparesis]]. Thalamotomy is a more efficacious surgical treatment for intractable MS tremor though the higher incidence of persistent neurological deficits in patients receiving lesional surgery supports the use of deep brain stimulation as the preferred surgical strategy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bittar RG, Hyam J, Nandi D, Wang S, Liu X, Joint C, Bain PG, Gregory R, Stein J, Aziz TZ |title=Thalamotomy versus thalamic stimulation for multiple sclerosis tremor |journal=Journal of Clinical Neuroscience |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=638–42 |year=2005 |pmid=16098758 |doi=10.1016/j.jocn.2004.09.008}}</ref>
