'''Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM)''' is a form of [[dilated cardiomyopathy]] that is defined as deterioration in cardiac function presenting typically between the last month of [[pregnancy]] and up to five months [[postpartum]].  As with other forms of dilated cardiomyopathy, PPCM involves systolic dysfunction of the heart with a decrease of the [[left ventricular ejection fraction]] (EF) with associated [[congestive heart failure]] and an increased risk of [[atrial]] and [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] [[arrhythmias]], [[thromboembolism]] (blockage of a blood vessel by a blood clot), and even [[sudden cardiac death]].  In essence, the heart muscle cannot contract forcefully enough to pump adequate amounts of blood for the needs of the body's vital organs.<ref name="Pearson">{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.283.9.1183 |author=Pearson GD, Veille JC, Rahimtoola S, ''et al.'' |title=Peripartum cardiomyopathy: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Office of Rare Diseases (National Institutes of Health) workshop recommendations and review |journal=JAMA |volume=283 |issue=9 |pages=1183–8 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10703781  |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/283/9/1183}}</ref><ref name="Elkayam2005">{{cite journal |author=Elkayam U, Akhter MW, Singh H, ''et al.'' |title=Pregnancy-associated cardiomyopathy: clinical characteristics and a comparison between early and late presentation |journal=Circulation |volume=111 |issue=16 |pages=2050–5 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15851613 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000162478.36652.7E |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/111/16/2050}}</ref><ref name="SliwaFett">{{cite journal |author=Sliwa K, Fett J, Elkayam U |title=Peripartum cardiomyopathy |journal=Lancet |volume=368 |issue=9536 |pages=687–93 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16920474 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69253-2}}</ref><ref name="Murali">{{cite journal |author=Murali S, Baldisseri MR |title=Peripartum cardiomyopathy |journal=Crit.

PPCM is a diagnosis of exclusion, wherein patients have no prior history of heart disease and there are no other known possible causes of heart failure. [[Echocardiogram]] is used to both diagnose and monitor the effectiveness of treatment for PPCM.<ref name="Pearson"/><ref name="Elkayam2005"/><ref name="SliwaFett"/><ref name="Murali"/><ref name="Phillips"/>

The cause of PPCM is unknown.  Currently, researchers are investigating cardiotropic viruses, [[autoimmunity]] or [[immune system]] dysfunction, other toxins that serve as triggers to immune system dysfunction, [[micronutrient]] or trace mineral definciencies, and genetics as possible components that contribute to or cause the development of PPCM.<ref name="Pearson"/><ref name="SliwaFett"/><ref name="Ansari">{{cite journal |author=Ansari AA, Fett JD, Carraway RE, Mayne AE, Onlamoon N, Sundstrom JB |title=Autoimmune mechanisms as the basis for human peripartum cardiomyopathy |journal=Clin Rev Allergy Immunol |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=301–24 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12402414 |doi=10.1385/CRIAI:23:3:301}}</ref>

The process of PPCM begins with an unknown trigger (possibly a cardiotropic virus or other yet unidentified catalyst) that initiates an inflammatory process in the heart. Consequently, heart muscle cells are damaged; some die or become scar tissue. Scar tissue has no ability to contract; therefore, the effectiveness of the pumping action of the heart is decreased. Also, damage to the cytoskeletal framework of the heart causes the heart to enlarge, stretch or alter in shape, also decreasing the heart's systolic function or output. The initial inflammatory process appears to cause an autoimmune or immune dysfunctional process, which in turn fuels the initial inflammatory process. Progressive loss of heart muscle cells leads to eventual heart failure.<ref name="Fett2008">{{cite journal |author=Fett JD |title=Understanding peripartum cardiomyopathy, 2008 |journal=Int. J. Cardiol. |volume=130 |issue=1 |pages=1–2 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18590935 |doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2008.03.076}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms usually include one or more of the following: [[orthopnea]] (difficulty breathing while lying flat), [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath on exertion), pitting [[edema]] (swelling), cough, frequent night-time urination, excessive weight gain during the last month of pregnancy (1-2+ kg/week; two to four or more pounds per week), [[palpitations]] (sensation of racing heart-rate, skipping beats, long pauses between beats, or fluttering), and chest pain.<ref name="Pearson"/><ref name="SliwaFett"/>

The shortness of breath is often described by PPCM patients as the inability to take a deep or full breath or to get enough air into the lungs.  Also, patients often describe the need to prop themselves up overnight by using two or more pillows in order to breathe better.  These symptoms, swelling, and/or cough may be indications of [[pulmonary edema]] (fluid in the lungs) resulting from acute heart failure and PPCM.

Unfortunately, patients and clinicians sometimes dismiss early symptoms because they appear to be typical of normal pregnancy.  Yet, early detection and treatment are critically important to the patient with PPCM.  Delays in diagnosis and treatment of PPCM are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.<ref name="Pearson"/><ref name="SliwaFett"/><ref name="Murali"/><ref name="Phillips"/><ref name="Desai"/><ref name="FettChristie">{{cite journal |author=Fett JD, Christie LG, Carraway RD, Ansari AA, Sundstrom JB, Murphy JG |title=Unrecognized peripartum cardiomyopathy in Haitian women |journal=Int J Gynaecol Obstet |volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=161–6 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=15961090 |doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2005.05.004}}</ref>

It is important to note that occasionally patients present with other signs or symptoms.  This is demonstrated by one report of a woman with [[liver failure]] five weeks postpartum who was being considered for liver transplant.  An echocardiogram was performed and revealed PPCM and heart failure as the cause of her severe liver failure.  Conventional heart failure medications were administered.  She survived and completely recovered from both the liver failure and PPCM.<ref name="Fussell">{{cite journal |author=Fussell KM, Awad JA, Ware LB |title=Case of fulminant hepatic failure due to unrecognized peripartum cardiomyopathy |journal=Crit. Care Med. |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=891–3 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15818120 |doi=10.1097/01.CCM.0000158517.25962.8E}}</ref>

It is also quite common for women to present with evidence of having an [[embolus]] (clot) passing from the heart to a vital organ, causing such complications as [[stroke]], loss of circulation to a limb, even [[coronary artery]] occlusion (blockage) with typical [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack).<ref name="Lasinska">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF03016693 |author=Lasinska-Kowara M, Dudziak M, Suchorzewska J |title=Two cases of postpartum cardiomyopathy initially misdiagnosed for pulmonary embolism |journal=Can J Anaesth |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=773–7 |year=2001 |month=September |pmid=11546718}}</ref>

For these reasons, it is paramount that clinicians hold a high suspicion of PPCM in any peri- or postpartum patient where unusual or unexplained symptoms or presentations occur.<ref name="Pearson"/><ref name="SliwaFett"/><ref name="Fett2008"/><ref name="Fussell"/><ref name="Lasinska"/>

==Treatment==
Early detection and treatment are associated with higher rates of recovery and decreased morbidity and mortality.<ref name="Pearson"/><ref name="SliwaFett"/><ref name="Murali"/><ref name="Phillips"/><ref name="Desai"/><ref name="FettChristie"/>

Treatment for PPCM is similar to treatment for congestive heart failure. Conventional heart failure treatment includes the use of diuretics, beta blockers (B-B), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) after delivery.  Diuretics, preferably [[furosemide]], help the body to get rid of excess water weight and also lower blood pressure.  ACE-I and B-B improve blood circulation and contribute to the reversal of the immune system dysfunction associated with PPCM.  If ACE-I is not well tolerated by the patient, it can be replaced by angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB).    Hydralazine with nitrates may replace ACE-I in [[breastfeeding]] mothers or before delivery; however, evidence suggests that this course of treatment may not be as effective as ACE-I but beneficial when necessary.<ref name="Pearson"/><ref name="SliwaFett"/><ref name="Murali"/><ref name="Phillips"/><ref name="Fett2008"/><ref name="FettChristie"/><ref name="Amos"/>

If EF is less than 35%, [[anticoagulation]] is indicated, as there is a greater risk of developing left ventricular thrombi (blood clots).  Sometimes implantation of a [[left ventricular assist device]] (LVAD) or even [[heart transplant]] also becomes necessary.<ref name="Pearson"/><ref name="Murali"/><ref name="Phillips"/><ref name="Fett2008"/><ref name="Aziz">{{cite journal |author=Aziz TM, Burgess MI, Acladious NN, ''et al.'' |title=Heart transplantation for peripartum cardiomyopathy: a report of three cases and a literature review |journal=Cardiovasc Surg |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=565–7 |year=1999 |month=August |pmid=10499901 |doi=10.1016/S0967-2109(99)00014-9}}</ref>

It is important that the patient receives regular follow-up care including frequent echocardiograms to monitor improvement or the lack thereof, particularly after changes of medical treatment regimes.

Patients who do not respond to initial treatment, defined as left ventricular EF remaining below 20% at two months or below 40% at three months with conventional treatment may merit further investigation, including cardiac [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), [[cardiac catheterization]], and endomyocardial biopsy for special staining and for viral [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) analysis. Antiviral therapy, immunoabsorption, intravenous [[gamma globulin]], or other immunomodulation therapy may then be considered accordingly, but following a controlled research-type protocol.<ref name="Fett2008"/>

Since no one knows for sure exactly when to discontinue treatment, even when recovery occurs quickly, it is still recommended that both ACE-I and B-B be continued for at least one year after diagnosis.<ref name="SliwaFett"/>

==Prognosis==
The most recent studies indicate that with newer conventional heart failure treatment consisting of [[diuretics]], [[ACE inhibitors]] and [[beta blockers]], the survival rate is very high at 98% or better, and almost all PPCM patients improve with treatment.<ref name="Amos">{{cite journal |author=Amos AM, Jaber WA, Russell SD |title=Improved outcomes in peripartum cardiomyopathy with contemporary treatments|journal=Am.

It is a misconception that hope for recovery depends upon improvement or recovery within the first six to 12 months of diagnosis.  Many women continue to improve or recover even years after diagnosis with continued medicinal treatment.<ref name="SliwaFett"/><ref name="Fett2005"/>  Once fully recovered, if there is no subsequent pregnancy, the possibility of relapse or recurrence of heart failure is minimal.<ref name="Amos"/><ref name="McNamara"/>

Subsequent pregnancy should be avoided when left ventricular function has not recovered and the EF is lower than 55%.<ref name="Pearson"/><ref name="Elkayam2001"/>  However, many women who have fully recovered from PPCM have gone on to have successful subsequent pregnancies.<ref name="Fett2008"/>  A significant study reports that the risk for recurrence of heart failure in recovered PPCM patients as a result of subsequent pregnancy is approximately 21% or better.<ref name="Elkayam2001"/>  The chance of relapse may be even smaller for those with normal contractile reserve as demonstrated by stress echocardiography.<ref name="Lampert">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0002-9378(97)80034-8 |author=Lampert MB, Weinert L, Hibbard J, Korcarz C, Lindheimer M, Lang RM |title=Contractile reserve in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy and recovered left ventricular function |journal=Am.

Where relapse occurs, conventional treatment should be resumed, including [[hydralazine]] with [[nitrates]] plus beta-blockers during pregnancy, or ACE-inhibitors plus beta-blockers following pregnancy.

==Epidemiology==
It is estimated that the incidence of PPCM in the United States is between 1 in 1300 to 4000 live births.<ref name="Pearson"/><ref name="Fett2005">{{cite journal |author=Fett JD, Christie LG, Carraway RD, Murphy JG |title=Five-year prospective study of the incidence and prognosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy at a single institution |journal=Mayo Clin.

Some studies assert that PPCM may be slightly more prevalent among  older women who have had higher numbers of liveborn children and among women of older and younger extremes of childbearing age.<ref name="Desai"/><ref name="Mielniczuk"/>   However, a quarter to a third of PPCM patients are young women who have given birth for the first time.<ref name="Elkayam2005"/><ref name="SliwaFett"/><ref name="Desai"/><ref name="Fett2005"/><ref name="SliwaForster">{{cite journal |author=Sliwa K, Förster O, Libhaber E, ''et al.'' |title=Peripartum cardiomyopathy: inflammatory markers as predictors of outcome in 100 prospectively studied patients |journal=Eur.

While the use of [[tocolytic]] agents or the development of [[preeclampsia]] (toxemia of pregnancy) and [[pregnancy-induced hypertension]] (PIH) may contribute to the worsening of heart failure, they do not cause PPCM; the majority of women have developed PPCM who neither received tocolytics nor had preeclampsia nor PIH.<ref name="Fett2005"/><ref name="SliwaForster"/>
