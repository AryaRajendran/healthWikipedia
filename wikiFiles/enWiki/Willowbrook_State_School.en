'''Willowbrook State School''' was a state-supported institution for children with [[intellectual disabilities]] located in the [[Willowbrook, Staten Island|Willowbrook]] neighborhood on [[Staten Island]] in [[New York City]] from 1947 until 1987.

The school was designed for 4,000, but by 1965 it had a population of 6,000. At the time it was the biggest state-run institution for people with mental disabilities in the United States.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=BosLzxdIEdgC&pg=PA10&lpg=PA10&dq=willowbrook+state+school+largest&source=bl&ots=xqt5Kfwuvg&sig=RYYn4RLz2hCO2aMxLknDhLYqZ8I&hl=en&ei=29OVSqv0DJDilAeji8C5DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3#v=onepage&q=willowbrook%20state%20school%20largest&f=false The Praeger Handbook of Special Education - by Alberto M.

Robert Kennedy]] to call it a "snake pit."<ref>[http://www.library.csi.cuny.edu/archives/WillowbrookRG.htm A Guide to Willowbrook State School Resources at Other Institutions] Retrieved August 25, 2009</ref>

Public outcry led to its closure in 1987, and to [[Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act|federal civil rights]] legislation protecting the disabled.

A portion of the grounds and some of the buildings were incorporated into the campus of the [[College of Staten Island]], which moved to Willowbrook in the early 1990s. The rest of the buildings sit abandoned and dilapidated in the [[Staten Island Greenbelt]].

==History==

===Construction and early conversion===
In 1938, plans were drawn up to build a facility for mentally disabled children on a {{convert|375|acre|km2}} site in the [[Willowbrook, Staten Island|Willowbrook]] section of Staten Island. Construction was completed in 1942, but instead of opening for its original purpose, it was converted into a [[United States Army]] hospital and named Halloran General Hospital, after the late Colonel Paul Stacey Halloran. After World War II, proposals were introduced to turn the site over to the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]], but in October 1947, the [[New York State Department of Mental Hygiene]] opened its facility there as originally planned, and the institution was named Willowbrook State School.

===Hepatitis studies===
Throughout the first decade of its operation, outbreaks of [[hepatitis]], primarily [[hepatitis A]] were common at the school. This led to a controversial medical study carried out there between the mid-1950s up to the 1970s by medical researchers [[Saul Krugman]] and [[Robert W. McCollum]], who monitored to gauge the effects of [[gamma globulin]] in combating it.<ref>Hevesi, Dennis. [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/education/26mccollum.html "Robert W. McCollum, Dean of Dartmouth Medical School, Dies at 85"],''[[The New York Times]]'', September 25, 2010. Accessed September 26, 2010. The took these kids and took blood samples from them and simply injected the diseases into their bodies.</ref> A public outcry forced the study to be discontinued.

===More scandals and abuses===
By 1965, Willowbrook housed over 6,000 mentally disabled children, despite having a maximum capacity of 4,000. Senator [[Robert Kennedy]] toured the institution in 1965 and proclaimed that individuals in the overcrowded facility were "living in filth and dirt, their clothing in rags, in rooms less comfortable and cheerful than the cages in which we put animals in a zoo" and offered a series of recommendations for improving conditions.<ref>Staff. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30E17F63C5A157A93C2A81782D85F418685F9 "Excerpts From Statement by Kennedy"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 10, 1965. Accessed September 26, 2010.</ref> Although the hepatitis study had been discontinued, the residential school's reputation was that of a warehouse for New York City's mentally disabled children, many of whom were presumably abandoned there by their families, foster care agencies or other systems designed to care for them. [[Donna J. Stone]], an advocate for mentally disabled children as well as victims of [[child abuse]], gained access to the school by posing as a recent social work graduate. She then shared her observations with members of the press.<ref>[[Geraldo Rivera|Rivera, Geraldo]]. ''Willowbrook: A Report on How It Is and Why It Doesn’t Have to Be That Way.'' New York: Random House, 1972. ISBN 0-394-71844-5</ref> 

A series of articles in local newspapers, including the ''[[Staten Island Advance]]'' and the ''[[Staten Island Register]]'', described the crowded, filthy living conditions at Willowbrook, and the [[negligent]] treatment of some of its residents. Shortly thereafter, in early 1972, [[Geraldo Rivera]], then an [[investigative reporter]] for [[WABC-TV]] in New York, conducted a series of investigations at Willowbrook uncovering a host of deplorable conditions, including overcrowding, inadequate sanitary facilities, and [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse|sexual]] abuse of residents by members of the school's staff. The exposé, entitled ''Willowbrook: The Last Disgrace'', garnered national attention and won a [[Peabody Award]] for Rivera.<ref name="Powers185">{{citation

As a result of the overcrowding, a [[class-action lawsuit]] was filed against the State of New York in federal court on March 17, 1972. A settlement in the case was reached on May 5, 1975, mandating reforms at the site, but several years would pass before all of the violations were corrected. The publicity generated by the case was a major contributing factor to the passage of a [[federal law]], the [[Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act|Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act of 1980]].

===Closing the school===
In 1975, a ''Willowbrook [[Consent Decree]]'' was signed that committed New York state to improve community placement for the now designated "Willowbrook Class."<ref name=omrdd>[http://www.omr.state.ny.us/journal/20aniv/hp_journal2mile.jsp Milestones in OMRDD's History], ''[[OMRDD]]'', (2001-09-19){{accessdate|2007-09-05}}</ref>

In 1983, the state of New York announced plans to close Willowbrook, which had been renamed the Staten Island Developmental Center in 1974. By the end of March 1986, the number of residents housed there had dwindled to 250, and the last children left the grounds on September 17, 1987.

After the developmental center closed, the site became the focus of intense local debate about what should be done with the property. In 1989 a portion of the land was acquired by the city of New York, with the intent of using it to establish a new campus for the College of Staten Island, and the new campus opened at Willowbrook in 1993. At {{convert|0.8|km2|acre|sp=us}}, this campus is the largest maintained by the [[City University of New York]].

Within the year, one of CSI's two other existing campuses, located in the [[Sunnyside, Staten Island|Sunnyside]] neighborhood, was closed, renovated, and opened in 1995 as the home of a new K-12 [[Michael J. Petrides School]].
 
The remaining {{convert|0.7|km2|acre|abbr=on}} of the state school's original property, at the south end, is still under the administration of the Office for People with Developmental Disabilities (OPWDD), an agency of the [[New York State Department of Mental Hygiene]], and houses the New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities and the Staten Island Developmental Disabilities Services Office.

On February 25, 1987, the [[United States federal courts|Federal Court]] approved the Willowbrook "1987 Stipulation," which set forth guidelines that required [[OMRDD]] community placement for the "Willowbrook Class".<ref name=omrdd/> Significant members of the "Willowbrook Class" were not as intellectually limited as the term "Developmental delay" would indicate. [[Cerebral Palsy]], a developmental disability that can be accompanied by varying degrees of intellectual impairment, but some members of this class were cognitively quite intact, yet unable to communicate verbally due to their physical condition. These ex-residents of Willowbrook, many now in their 50's and 60's, live in a variety of community residences and attend day programs throughout New York State, under the care of organizations such as [[United Cerebral Palsy]] or the Jewish Guild for the Blind.

In March, 2009, a fire in a residence in upstate [[Wells, New York]], killed four members of the "Willowbrook Class".<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/willowbrook-class-members-killed-fire-group-home-part-infamous-suit-s-i-school-article-1.370717 Willowbrook Class Members Killed in Fire] NY Daily News</ref>

==Miscellaneous==
Willowbrook State Hospital is mentioned in the 2009 documentary movie [[Cropsey (film)|Cropsey]], as having reportedly housed convicted child kidnapper Andre Rand, who had previously worked there as an orderly.<ref>2009 documentary Cropsey</ref>  One of Rand's supposed victims, Jennifer Schweiger, was found buried in a shallow grave behind the grounds of the abandoned Willowbrook State School which was built under the same design as [[Pilgrim State Hospital]].
In 2011, a former resident of Willowbrook State School, a [[Savant syndrome|savant]] named [[Anthony Torrone]] wrote a [[Christian]] [[prayer]] [[book]] titled [[Anthony's Prayers]] that was inspired by his time and the abuse he experienced at the school.<ref>http://www.mlive.com/living/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2011/11/anthonys_prayers_a_simple_book.html 'Anthony's Prayers': A simple book by Grand Rapids' Anthony Torrone, a grateful survivor</ref><ref>http://www.silive.com/worship/2012/01/my_lord_savior_god_helped_me_s.html 'My Lord Savior God helped me survive'</ref>
A mock homage to this film is briefly portrayed in Season 2 episode 13 of American Horror Story: Asylum entitled "Madness Ends" in which the fictional journalist Lana Winters brings In a camera crew into the Briarcliff Insane Asylum capturing deplorable and inhumane treatment of patients which Winters later names "Briarcliff:An Exposé" and thus launches her career and brings her the fame she had worked for. The depiction is eerily similar to Geraldo Riveras' "Willowbrook: The Final Disgrace" documentary.
