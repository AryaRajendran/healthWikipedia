'''Vaginal cancer''' is any type of [[cancer]] that forms in the tissues of the [[vagina]].  Primary vaginal cancer is rare in the general population of women and is usually a [[squamous-cell carcinoma]]. Metastases are more common. Vaginal cancer occurs more often in women over age 50, but can occur at any age, even in infancy. It often can be cured if found and treated in early [[cancer staging|stages]]. Surgery alone or surgery combined with pelvic radiation is typically used to treat vaginal cancer.

==Types==

There are two primary types of vaginal cancer: [[squamous-cell carcinoma]] and adenocarcinoma.<ref name="urlVaginal Cancer Treatment - National Cancer Institute">{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/vaginal/Patient |title=Vaginal Cancer Treatment - National Cancer Institute |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-12-29}}</ref>

* Vaginal squamous-cell carcinoma arises from the thin, flat [[squamous cell]]s that line the vagina. This is the most common type of vaginal cancer. It is found most often in women aged 60 or older.
* Vaginal [[adenocarcinoma]] arises from the glandular (secretory) cells in the lining of the vagina that produce some vaginal fluids. Adenocarcinoma is more likely than squamous cell cancer to spread to the [[lung]]s and [[lymph node]]s. It is found most often in women aged 30 or younger.

* A specific subtype of [[adenocarcinoma]] ("Clear Cell") occurs in a small percent of women (termed "DES-Daughters") born between 1938 and 1973 (later outside the United States) that were exposed to the drug [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) in utero. DES was prescribed to 5 to 10 million mothers in that timespan to prevent possible miscarriages and premature birth.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/DES/consumers/about/index.html</ref> Typically, patients present with DES-related adenocarcinoma before age 30, but increasing evidence suggests possible effects or cancers (including other forms of vaginal glandular tumors) at a later age for DES-exposed women. DES-exposure in women is also linked to various infertility and pregnancy complications. Daughters exposed to DES in utero may also have an increased risk of moderate/severe cervical squamous cell dysplasia and an increased risk of breast cancer.<ref name="urlAbout DES">{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/DES/consumers/about/index.html |title=About DES |work= |accessdate=2009-12-29}}</ref> Approximately one in 1,000 (0.1%) DES Daughters will be diagnosed with CCA. The risk is virtually non-existent among premenopausal women not exposed to DES.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/des/consumers/about/effects_daughters.html</ref>

There are also less common forms of vaginal cancer:
* Vaginal [[germ cell tumor]]s (primarily [[teratoma]] and [[endodermal sinus tumor]]) are rare.  They are found most often in infants and children.
* [[Sarcoma botryoides]], a [[rhabdomyosarcoma]] also is found most often in infants and children.

==Signs and symptoms==
Often, there are no symptoms, and the cancer is found through a routine [[Gynaecology|gynecologic]] exam. If there are symptoms, they are commonly abnormal vaginal bleeding, which may be post-coital, intermenstrual, prepubertal, or postmenopausal.<ref name=health.am>{{cite web | title =Vaginal Cancer | work =Gynocologic Malignancies | url=http://www.health.am/cr/more/vaginal-cancer/| year = 2005 |  publisher=Armenian Health Network, Health.am | accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref>  Other, less specific signs include difficult or painful urination, pain during intercourse, and pain in the pelvic area. Women who suspect exposure to DES should undergo a more extensive gynecological exam on a regular basis because the normal exam procedure does not closely examine the areas of the vagina usually obscured by the speculum in standard gynecological exams.

==Diagnosis==

Several tests are used to diagnose vaginal cancer, including:

* Physical exam and history
* [[Pelvic exam]]
* [[Pap smear]]
* Biopsy
* [[Colposcopy]]
