'''Pus''' is an [[exudate]], typically white-yellow, yellow, or yellow-brown, formed at the site of [[inflammation]] during [[infection]].<ref>

</ref> An accumulation of pus in an enclosed tissue space is known as an [[abscess]], whereas a visible collection of pus within or beneath the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] is known as a [[pustule]] or [[pimple]].

Pus consists of a thin, [[protein]]-rich fluid, known as ''liquor puris'', and dead [[leukocytes]] from the body's [[immune response]] (mostly [[neutrophils]]). During infection, [[macrophage]]s  release [[cytokine]]s  which trigger neutrophils to seek the site of infection by [[chemotaxis]]. There, the neutrophils engulf and destroy the bacteria and the bacteria resist the immune response by releasing toxins called [[leukocidin]]s.<ref name=Biology>Madigan, Michael T. and Martin, John M. Brock Biology of Microorganisms 11th ed. Pearson Prentice Hall. USA. 2006: 734</ref> As the neutrophils die off from toxins and old age, they are [[phagocytosis|destroyed]] by macrophages, forming the viscous pus.

Bacteria that cause pus are called '''suppurative''', '''pyogenic''',<ref name=Biology/><ref>{{DorlandsDict|seven/000088920|pyogenic}}</ref> or '''purulent'''. If the agent also creates [[mucus]], it is called ''mucopurulent''. Purulent infections can be treated with an [[antiseptic]].

Despite normally being of a whitish-yellow hue, changes in the color of pus can be observed under certain circumstances.  Pus is sometimes green because of the presence of [[myeloperoxidase]], an intensely green antibacterial protein produced by some types of white blood cells.  Green, foul-smelling pus is found in certain infections of ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''. The greenish color is a result of the pyocyanin bacterial pigment it produces. [[amoeba|Amoebic]] abscesses of the [[liver]] produce brownish pus, which is described as looking like "anchovy paste". Pus can also have a foul odor.

In almost all cases when there is a collection of pus in the body, the clinician will try to create an opening for it to evacuate - this principle has been distilled into the famous Latin aphorism "[[Ubi pus, ibi evacua]]!"

Some common disease processes caused by pyogenic infections are [[impetigo]], [[osteomyelitis]], [[septic arthritis]], and [[necrotizing fasciitis]].<ref name=Dermatopathology>{{citation|pages=83–85|title=Infections Caused by Common Pyogenic Bacteria|work=Dermatopathology|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|doi=10.1007/3-540-30244-1_12}}</ref>{{not in source|date=March 2013}}
