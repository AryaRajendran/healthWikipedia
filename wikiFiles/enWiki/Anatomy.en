'''Anatomy''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνατέμνω }} - ''anatemnō'', "cut up, cut open", from ἀνά - ''ana'', "on, upon", and τέμνω - ''temnō'', "I cut") is a branch of [[biology]] and [[medicine]] that considers the [[body plan|structure of living things]]. It is a general term that includes [[human anatomy]], [[animal anatomy]] (zootomy), and [[plant anatomy]] (phytotomy). In some of its facets anatomy is closely related to [[embryology]], [[comparative anatomy]] and [[Phylogenetics|comparative embryology]],<ref name="intro HGray">{{cite web | url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html| title= Introduction page, "Anatomy of the Human Body". Henry Gray. 20th edition. 1918| accessdate =19 March 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070316005206/http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html| archivedate= 16 March 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> through common roots in [[evolution]].

Anatomy is subdivided into gross anatomy (or [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] anatomy) and [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] anatomy.<ref name="intro HGray" /> [[Gross anatomy]] is the study of anatomical structures that can, when suitably presented or [[dissection|dissected]], be seen by unaided vision with the naked eye.<ref name="intro HGray" /> [[Microscopic anatomy]] is the study of minute anatomical structures on a microscopic scale. It includes [[histology]] (the study of tissues),<ref name="intro HGray" /> and [[Cell biology|cytology]] (the study of cells). The terms microanatomy and histology are also sometimes used synonymously (in which case the distinction between histology and cell biology isn't strictly made as described here).

The [[history of anatomy]] has been characterized, over time, by a continually developing understanding of the functions of [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and structures in the body. Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from examination of [[animal]]s through dissection of [[cadaver]]s (dead human bodies) to technologically complex techniques developed in the 20th century including [[X-ray machine|X-ray]], [[Ultrasound imaging|ultrasound]], and [[MRI]].

Anatomy should not be confused with [[anatomical pathology]] (also called morbid anatomy or [[histopathology]]), which is the study of the gross and microscopic appearances of [[disease]]d [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s.

== Superficial anatomy ==
[[Superficial anatomy]] or surface anatomy is important in anatomy being the study of anatomical landmarks that can be readily seen from the contours or the surface of the body.<ref name="intro HGray"/> With knowledge of superficial anatomy, [[physician]]s or [[veterinary surgeon]]s gauge the position and anatomy of the associated deeper structures.
Superficial is a directional term that indicates one structure is located more externally than another, or closer to the surface of the body.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marieb|first=Elaine|title=Human Anatomy & Physiology|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|location=San Francisco|page=12}}</ref>

Human anatomy, including gross [[human anatomy]] and histology, is primarily the scientific study of the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the adult [[human]] body.<ref name="intro HGray" />

Generally, students of certain [[biology|biological sciences]], [[paramedic]]s, prosthetists and orthotists, [[physical therapy|physiotherapists]], [[occupational therapy|occupational therapists]], [[nurse]]s, and [[medical school|medical students]] learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials, and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of [[dissection]] and inspection of [[cadaver]]s. The study of microscopic anatomy (or [[histology]]) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a [[microscope]].

[[Human anatomy]], [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]] are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school. Human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically;<ref name="intro HGray" /> that is, respectively, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems. The major anatomy textbook, [[Gray's Anatomy]], has recently been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format,<!--

A thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by [[physicians]], especially [[surgery|surgeons]] and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties, such as [[histopathology]] and [[radiology]].

[[Academic]] human anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells.
