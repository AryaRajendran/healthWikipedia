'''''JAMA''', The Journal of the American Medical Association'', is a weekly [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[medical journal]] published by the [[American Medical Association]]. Since 2011, the [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Howard C. Bauchner]] ([[Boston University]]), who succeeded [[Catherine D. DeAngelis]], who had served since 2000.<ref>[http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/new-editor-in-chief-named-at-journal-of-the-american-medical-association/31246?sid=at&utm_source=at&utm_medium=en "New Editor in Chief Named at "Journal of the American Medical Association'" ''Chronicle of Higher Education,'' March 10, 2011]</ref> The journal was established in 1883, with [[Nathan Smith Davis]] as founding editor. The acronym JAMA was added in 1960. The journal has [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] language editions.

== Aims and scope ==
''JAMA'' was established in 1883 by the American Medical Association and has been published continuously since then. It publishes original research, reviews, commentaries, editorials, essays, medical news, correspondence, and ancillary content (such as abstracts of the ''[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]]''). The journal covers all aspects of the [[Biomedicine|biomedical sciences]].

== Continuing medical education ==
''Continuing Education Opportunities for Physicians'' is a semianual journal section providing lists for regional or national levels of [[continuing medical education]] (CME). ''JAMA'' has provided this information since 1937. Prior to 1955, the list was produced either quarterly or semiannually. Between 1955 and 1981, the list was available annually, as the number of ''CME'' offerings increased from 1,000 (1955) to 8,500 (1981). The AMA website states that [[webinar]]s are available for CME.<ref name=CME1987>

== Policy shift ==
After the controversial firing of an editor-in-chief, [[George D. Lundberg]], a process was put in place to ensure editorial freedom. A seven member oversight committee was created to evaluate the editor-in-chief and to help ensure editorial independence. Since its inception, the committee has met at least once a year. Presently, ''JAMA'' states that article content should be attributed to authors and not the publisher.<ref name="sciencenow.sciencemag">[http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/1999/115/2 Constance Holden, JAMA Editor Gets the Boot, Science Now, 15 January 1999]</ref><ref>Jerome P.
