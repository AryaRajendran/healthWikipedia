'''Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome''' (PRES), also known as '''reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome''' (RPLS),  is a syndrome characterized by [[headache]], [[confusion]], [[seizure]]s and [[visual loss]]. It may occur due to a number of causes, predominantly [[malignant hypertension]], [[eclampsia]] and some medical treatments. On [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) of the brain, areas of [[cerebral edema|edema]] (swelling) are seen. The symptoms tend to resolve after a period of time, although visual changes sometimes remain.<ref name=Garg>{{cite journal |author=Garg RK |title=Posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome |journal=Postgrad Med J |volume=77 |issue=903 |pages=24–8 |year=2001 |month=January |pmid=11123390 |pmc=1741870 |doi=10.1136/pmj.77.903.24 |url=http://pmj.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/77/903/24}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Pula JH, Eggenberger E |title=Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome |journal=Curr Opin Ophthalmol |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=479–84 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=18854692 |doi=10.1097/ICU.0b013e3283129746 |url=}}</ref> It was first described in 1996.<ref name=Hinchey>{{cite journal | author = Hinchey J, Chaves C, Appignani B, Breen J, Pao L, Wang A, Pessin M, Lamy C, Mas J, Caplan L | title = A reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 334 | issue = 8 | pages = 494–500 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8559202 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199602223340803}}</ref>

==Causes==
PRES occurs due to the use of drugs like [[tacrolimus]] and [[cyclosporine]], hence it may occur in people who have undergone an [[organ transplant]], in which these drugs may be used to suppress [[transplant rejection]]. It also occurs due to [[eclampsia]], [[hypertensive emergency|severe high blood pressure]], dramatic changes in blood pressure, and [[hypercalcemia]]. Low magnesium levels can augment PRES.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is typically made on [[magnetic resonance imaging]] of the brain; this may show hyperintensities on [[Spin-spin relaxation time|''T<sub>2</sub>''-weighed imaging]]. Three different patterns have been described on MRI imaging.<ref>Peter P, George A. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and the pediatric population. J Pediatr Neurosci 2012;7:136-8.</ref> [[Cerebral angiography]] may provide a more definite diagnosis.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Treatment==
The treatment of PRES depends on the underlying cause. For instance, if the main problem is high blood pressure, blood pressure control will accelerate the resolution of the abnormalities. If the likely cause is medication, the withdrawal of the drug in question is needed.<ref>Pedraza R, Marik PE, Varon J (November 2009). Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome: A Review.
