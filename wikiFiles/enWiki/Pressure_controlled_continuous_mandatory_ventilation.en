'''Pressure Controlled Continuous Mandatory Ventilation''' ('''PC-CMV''') is any [[mode of mechanical ventilation]] with preset inspiratory pressure and inspiratory time. Every breath is mandatory (ie, patient or machine triggered and machine cycled).

==Pressure control==
'''PCV''' â€” Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV) also Pressure Control (PC) is a controlled mode of ventilation. The ventilator delivers a flow to maintain the preset pressure at a preset [[respiratory rate]] over a preset inspiratory time.<ref>MAQUET, "Modes of ventilation in SERVO-i, Invasive and Non-invasive, 2008 MAQUET Critical Care AB, Order No 66 14 692</ref>

The pressure is constant during the inspiratory time and the flow is decelerating. If for any reason pressure decreases during isnpiration, the flow from the ventilator will immediately increase to maintain the set inspiratory pressure.<ref>MAQUET, "Modes of ventilation in SERVO-s, Invasive and Non-invasive", 2009 MAQUET [[Intensive care medicine|Critical Care]] AB, Order No 66 61 131</ref>
