The '''frontal bone''' or '' '''os frontis''' ''is a [[bone]] in the [[human skull]]. The name comes from the Latin word ''frons'' (meaning "[[forehead]]").  The bone resembles a [[Cockle (bivalve)|cockleshell]] in form, and consists of three portions:<ref name="Gray's">''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'' (1918). (See infobox)</ref>

* a large vertical portion, the [[squama frontalis]], corresponding with the region of the [[forehead]].
* an orbital or horizontal portion, the [[pars orbitalis]], which enters into the formation of the roofs of the [[orbital cavity|orbital]] and [[nasal cavity|nasal cavities]].
* a nasal portion, it articulates with the nasal bones and the [[frontal process of maxilla|frontal process of the maxilla]] to form the root of the [[nose]].

==Embryology==
The frontal bone is presumed to be derived from [[neural crest cell]]s.<ref>Kirby, ML; Waldo, KL. ''Circulation'' (1990) 82:332-340.</ref>

==Borders==
The border of the squama frontalis is thick, strongly serrated, bevelled at the expense of the inner table above, where it rests upon the parietal bones, and at the expense of the outer table on either side, where it receives the lateral pressure of those bones; this border is continued below into a triangular, rough surface, which articulates with the great wing of the [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]]. The posterior borders of the orbital plates are thin and serrated, and articulate with the small wings of the sphenoid.

==In other animals==
In most vertebrates, the frontal bone is paired, rather than presenting the single, fused structure found in humans (see [[frontal suture]]). It typically lies on the upper part of the head, between the eyes, but in many non-[[mammal]]ian animals it does not form part of the orbital cavity. Instead, in [[reptile]]s, [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]] and [[amphibian]]s it is often separated from the orbits by one or two additional bones not found in mammals. These bones, the [[prefrontal bone|prefrontals]] and [[postfrontal]]s, together form the upper margin of the eye sockets, and lie to either side of the frontal bones.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 226–241|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>
