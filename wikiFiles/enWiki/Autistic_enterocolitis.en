==Background==
Until the 1970s, [[autism]] was rarely accepted to be a distinctive diagnosis, but, following changes to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] it is diagnosed much more often. How much of this increase is due to greater diagnostic vigilance by doctors, changes in diagnostic categories, or an actual increase in [[prevalence]], remains unclear.  Late-onset autism cases are estimated at 25% and reported by sources including the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' as not having changed in recent years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Taylor B, Miller E, Lingam R, Andrews N, Simmons A, Stowe J |title=Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination and bowel problems or developmental regression in children with autism: population study |journal=BMJ |volume=324 |issue=7334 |pages=393–6 |year=2002 |pmid=11850369 |pmc=65532 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11850369 |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7334.393}}</ref>

Despite others{{Who|date=August 2011}} describing common bowel features, there have been no [[peer review]]ed studies yet published, as of 2006, corroborating the existence of ''autistic enterocolitis''; other studies have explicitly refuted its existence.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Black C, Kaye JA, Jick H |title=Relation of childhood gastrointestinal disorders to autism: nested case-control study using data from the UK General Practice Research Database |journal=BMJ |volume=325 |issue=7361 |pages=419–21 |year=2002 |pmid=12193358 |pmc=119436 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12193358 |doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7361.419}}</ref>  Thus, it is not generally accepted that the types of colitis diagnosed in autistic individuals are either unique to autism, or more common in autistic people than in the general population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/mmr_prog_summary.shtml|title=Does the MMR Jab Cause Autism?|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2007-11-25| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071021200325/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/mmr_prog_summary.shtml| archivedate= 21 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==''Lancet'' study==
When Wakefield and his colleagues first reported in 1998 a possible association between autistic regression, IBD, and [[MMR vaccine]]s in the ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'', they evaluated a dozen children with [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s, apparent developmental regression, and intestinal symptoms, referred to the [[Royal Free Hospital]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= [[Andrew Wakefield|Wakefield A]], Murch S, Anthony A ''et al.'' |title= Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=Lancet |volume=351 |issue=9103 |pages=637–41 |year=1998 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0 |pmid=9500320 |url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm |accessdate=2007-09-05| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070927010149/http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm| archivedate= 27 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}{{Retracted paper|PMID 20137807|intentional=yes}}</ref>

According to parents, onset of behavioral symptoms was linked to recent (within two weeks) immunization with MMR vaccine in eight of the children diagnosed with developmental disorders. The most consistent report was lymphoid nodular hyperplasia of the terminal [[ileum]] in nine of the children.  This feature has also been reported to be very common in non-autistic children.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://briandeer.com/wakefield/ileal-hyperplasia.htm|title=Wakefield MMR-autism sign was recognized for years: as benign finding in children|publisher=[[Brian Deer]]|accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref>  A variety of colonic and rectal mucosal features were reported in eight cases. Biopsies of the ileum were reported to have shown reactive lymphoid follicular hyperplasia in seven.  Biopsies of the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] were reported to have shown a diffuse mononuclear cell infiltrate in six.

Wakefield and his colleagues said they described features of regressive autism with bowel disorders, or what Wakefield would later call ''autistic enterocolitis'', although these findings have been questioned, with claims that the association of features is substantially an artifact of preselection of vaccinated children with both developmental disorders and bowel symptoms for a UK lawsuit:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-summary.htm |title= The MMR-autism crisis - our story so far |accessdate=2008-12-06 |author= Deer B |date=2008-11-02| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081206015353/http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-summary.htm| archivedate= 6 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
* Most of the children were reported to have swelling of the [[lymph]]oid tissue lining the [[intestine]]s, particularly near where the small and [[large intestine]]s meet, and inflammation of the large intestine, associated with [[constipation]], [[diarrhea]] and, in some cases, pain.
* In some affected children, impaired cellular immunity to common recall [[antigen]]s, with low numbers of circulating [[white blood cell]]s were reported.
* A specific [[measles]] protein signal is claimed to have been detected in inflamed lymphoid tissue.
* In some cases, loss of speech and language, bowel disturbances, self-injury, and a self-limited diet, associated with cravings for particular foods.
* [[Allergy|Allergies]], [[food intolerance]]s are also reported in some children.

In an April 2010 investigation into the origins of claims for "autistic enterocolitis", reporter [[Brian Deer]] revealed in the [[BMJ]] that the original pathology results on the children in the study (obtained from the Royal Free hospital) had been subjected to wholesale changes, from normal to abnormal, in the medical school.<ref name="Deer B"/> On 2 January 2011, Deer provided two tables comparing the data on the twelve children, showing the original hospital data and the data with the wholesale changes as used in the 1998 ''Lancet'' article.<ref name=Deer_tables>[http://www.bmj.com/content/suppl/2011/01/05/bmj.c5347.DC1/deeb200710.ww1_default.pdf "MMR & Autism: Fixing a Link"], Tables prepared by Brian Deer as a supplement to his peer reviewed report “How the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed”, published in the BMJ in January 2011 (BMJ 2011;342:c5347).</ref>

A 2011 article in the [[British Medical Journal]] described how the data in the study had been falsified by Wakefield so it would arrive at a predetermined conclusion.<ref name=Deer2011>{{cite journal | title=How the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed| author=Deer B| journal=BMJ| year=2011| volume=342| pages=c5347| url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347.full |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c5347| pmid=21209059}}</ref> An accompanying editorial in the same journal described Wakefield's work as an "elaborate [[fraudulent|fraud]]" which led to lower vaccination rates, putting hundreds of thousands of children at risk and diverting energy and money away from research into the true cause of autism.<ref name=BMJ2011>{{cite journal |year= 2011 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c7452 |pages= c7452 |volume= 342:c7452

==Discredited link to MMR vaccinations==
Wakefield has hypothesized that ''autistic enterocolitis'' is an emergent IBD [[phenotype]] that follows from exposure to the [[vaccination]]s given to children during a period when their immune systems are rapidly developing.  Other research, however, rejects this hypothesis, and other groups have not reproduced Wakefield's findings.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thjodleifsson B, Davídsdóttir K, Agnarsson U, Sigthórsson G, Kjeld M, Bjarnason I |title=Effect of Pentavac and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination on the intestine |journal=Gut |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=816–7 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12427783 |pmc=1773472 |url=http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12427783 |doi=10.1136/gut.51.6.816}}

This [[conflict of interest]], which Wakefield denies, has led many to criticize Wakefield and his results. The British [[General Medical Council]] has launched an inquiry into possible dishonesty by Wakefield regarding his research.<ref name=LegalAid/>

=="Retraction of an interpretation"==
The  ''Lancet'' paper has been widely cited as an impetus for concerns regarding the MMR vaccine being a cause of autism.  Wakefield gave interviews after the publication of the paper, including on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' where he raised concerns regarding administration of the MMR vaccine.  In the ''Lancet'' paper, Wakefield and his co-authors said on the issue:
:"''We did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described. Virological studies are underway that may help to resolve this issue''"

In 2004, 10 of the 13 authors issued a statement in the ''Lancet''  entitled "Retraction of an interpretation".<ref name=PMID15016483>{{cite journal |author=Murch SH, Anthony A, Casson DH, ''et al.'' |title=Retraction of an interpretation |journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9411 |page=750 |year=2004 |pmid=15016483 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15715-2}}</ref> In this, the authors retracted the conclusion section of the paper, formally known in the Lancet and in many biomedical journals, as the "interpretation". The section of the paper retracted said:

:"''Interpretation.  We identified associated gastrointestinal disease and developmental regression in a group of previously normal children, which was generally associated in time with possible environmental triggers.''"

In the retraction, issued in March 2004, they said:

:"''We wish to make it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between MMR vaccine and autism as the data were insufficient. However, the possibility of such a link was raised and consequent events have had major implications for public health. In view of this, we consider now is the appropriate time that we should together formally retract the interpretation placed upon these findings in the paper, according to precedent.''"

The authors also said:

:"''The main thrust of this paper was the first description of an unexpected intestinal lesion in the children reported. Further evidence has been forthcoming in studies from the Royal Free Centre for Paediatric Gastroenterology and other groups to support and extend these findings.  While much uncertainty remains about the nature of these changes, we believe it important that such work continues, as autistic children can potentially be helped by recognition and treatment of gastrointestinal problems.''"

Just before the retraction, criticism arose over the fact that the [[Royal Free Hospital]] had received £55,000 in August 1996 from lawyers preparing to sue MMR manufacturers for support of Dr. Wakefield's research. Wakefield asserted that the donation was to fund a second clinical study; some of the children involved were subjects in both studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4743|title=Controversial MMR and autism study retracted|date=4 March 2004|publisher=NewScientist.com|author=McKee, Maggie|accessdate=2007-11-25| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071024030731/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4743| archivedate= 24 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> However, it was subsequently revealed by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' of London that Wakefield had personally been paid more than £400,000.<ref name=LegalAid>{{cite news| title=MMR Doctor given legal aid thousands|work=The Sunday Times |date=December 31, 2006|author=Deer, Brian|url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/st-dec-2006.htm|accessdate=2007-11-25|authorlink=Brian Deer| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071028093457/http://briandeer.com/mmr/st-dec-2006.htm| archivedate= 28 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Wakefield, who did not sign the retraction, currently faces disciplinary charges before the [[General Medical Council]] over the conduct of this research.<ref>{{cite news |author=Deer B |title= MMR scare doctor faces list of charges |work= Sunday Times |date=2005-09-11 |url=http://briandeer.com/wakefield/gmc-alleges.htm |format=Reprint |accessdate=2007-08-10 |authorlink= Brian Deer| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070809053218/http://briandeer.com/wakefield/gmc-alleges.htm| archivedate= 9 August 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In February 2009 ''The Sunday Times'' reported that Wakefield had manipulated patient data and misreported results in his 1998 paper, creating the appearance of a link with autism.<ref name=Deer2009>{{cite news |author= Deer B |title= MMR doctor Andrew Wakefield fixed data on autism |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece |work= Sunday Times |date=2009-02-08 |accessdate=2009-02-09 | location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090208234919/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece| archivedate= 8 February 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In February 2012, the [[Cochrane Library]] published its analysis of dozens of "high quality" medical studies which concluded no link could be found between the MMR vaccine and bowel disease, autism or other [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s.  To increase the rigor of the meta-analysis, the criteria of the meta-analysis excluded smaller studies and studies that had the potential for bias.  Wakefield's work was specifically excluded in the meta-analysis due to small sample size.  With regard to the vaccine, Cochrane said that its survey of research "strongly supports its use".<ref name=cd004407>{{cite journal |author=Demicheli V, Rivetti A, Debalini MG, Di Pietrantonj C |title=Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=2 |issue= |pages=CD004407 |year=2012 |pmid=22336803 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub3}}</ref>

==U.S. Court of Federal Claims==
On February 12, 2009, three Special Masters of the [[United States Court of Federal Claims]] rendered three opinions<ref>[http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/node/5026 Court of Federal Claims opinions]</ref> in three "test cases" that were proceeding in that court, each of which addressed causation issues relating to MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).  The opinions were critical of [[Arthur Krigsman]] and his testimony about autistic enterocolitis, which the court said that he described as a "new form of gastrointestinal [GI] disorder." Typical of their criticism was the following passage found at page 199 of the opinion in the Snyder case:<ref>[http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/vaccine_files/Vowell.Snyder.pdf Court of Federal Claims opinion in the Snyder case]</ref> "Doctor Krigsman was qualified to testify about gastroenterology [but his] qualifications to establish the validity of a new form of gastrointestinal disorder, unrecognized by other authorities in the field, were ... sadly lacking." The court noted that the "medical textbooks" do not recognize autistic enterocolitis. At page 27, the same opinion stated that "Dr. Krigsman’s testimony about autistic enterocolitis as a diagnostic entity was speculative."

In his judgment in Cedillo v Secretary for Health and Human Services, February 12, 2009, Special Master George Hastings said:

:"''To be sure, the petitioners in this case have stressed that they rely upon Dr Krigsman as their expert concerning the causation of GI symptoms, not Dr Wakefield. Thus, they argue that criticisms of the personal integrity of Dr Wakefield are not relevant here. However, because Dr Krigsman’s general causation approach clearly was strongly influenced by Dr Wakefield’s theory, criticisms of Dr Wakefield’s “autistic enterocolitis” theory are relevant, and criticisms relating to Dr Wakefield’s credibility in developing that theory are of relevance as well. Therefore, it is a noteworthy point that not only has that “autistic enterocolitis” theory not been accepted into gastroenterology textbooks, but that theory, and Dr Wakefield’s role in its development, have been strongly criticized as constituting defective or fraudulent science.''"
