'''Typhoid fever''', also known simply as '''typhoid''',<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|001332|Typhoid fever}}</ref> is a common worldwide bacterial disease, transmitted by the ingestion of food or water contaminated with the [[feces]] of an infected person, which contain the bacterium ''[[Salmonella enterica enterica]]'', [[serovar]] Typhi.<ref>http://textbookofbacteriology.net/salmonella.html</ref>

The disease has received various names, such as '''gastric fever''', '''abdominal typhus''', '''infantile remittant fever''', '''slow fever''', '''nervous fever''' or '''pythogenic fever'''. The name "typhoid" means "resembling [[typhus]]" and comes from the neuropsychiatric symptoms common to typhoid and typhus.<ref name=oxford>Oxford English Dictionary. ''typhoid, adj. and n.'' and ''typhus, n''. Online version March 2011.  Retrieved May 2011.</ref> Despite this similarity of their names, typhoid fever and typhus are distinct diseases and are caused by different species of bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cunha BA |title=Osler on typhoid fever: differentiating typhoid from typhus and malaria |journal=Infect. Dis. Clin. North Am. |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=111–25 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15081508 |doi=10.1016/S0891-5520(03)00094-1}}</ref>

The impact of this disease fell sharply in the developed world with the application of 20th century sanitation techniques.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

== Signs and symptoms ==
Classically, the course of untreated typhoid fever is divided into four individual stages, each lasting approximately one week. In the first week, the temperature rises slowly and fever fluctuations are seen with relative [[bradycardia]], [[malaise]], headache, and cough. A bloody nose ([[epistaxis]]) is seen in a quarter of cases and abdominal pain is also possible. There is  a decrease in the number of circulating white blood cells ([[leukopenia]]) with [[eosinopenia]] and relative [[lymphocytosis]], a positive  reaction and blood cultures are positive for ''[[Salmonella]] typhi'' or ''paratyphi''. The [[Widal test]] is negative in the first week.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In the second week of the infection, the patient lies prostrate with high fever in plateau around {{convert|40|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and [[bradycardia]] (sphygmothermic dissociation or [[Faget sign]]), classically with a [[dicrotic pulse]] wave. Delirium is frequent, frequently calm, but sometimes agitated.  This [[delirium]] gives to typhoid the nickname of "nervous fever". Rose spots appear on the lower chest and abdomen in around a third of patients. There are [[rhonchi]] in lung bases.

The abdomen is distended and painful in the right lower quadrant where [[borborygmi]] can be heard. Diarrhea can occur in this stage: six to eight stools in a day, green, comparable to pea soup, with a characteristic smell. However, constipation is also frequent. The spleen and liver  are enlarged ([[hepatosplenomegaly]]) and tender, and there is elevation of liver [[transaminases]]. The [[Widal test]] is strongly positive with antiO and antiH antibodies. Blood cultures are sometimes still positive at this stage.
(The major symptom of this fever is that the [[fever]] usually rises in the afternoon up to the first and second week.)

In the third week of typhoid fever, a number of complications can occur:
* [[Gastrointestinal bleeding|Intestinal hemorrhage]] due to bleeding in congested [[Peyer's patches]]; this can be very serious but is usually not fatal.
* Intestinal perforation in the distal [[ileum]]: this is a very serious complication and is frequently fatal. It may occur without alarming symptoms until [[septicaemia]] or diffuse [[peritonitis]] sets in.
* [[Encephalitis]]
* Neuropsychiatric symptoms (described as "muttering delirium" or "coma vigil"), with picking at bedclothes or imaginary objects.
* Metastatic abscesses, [[cholecystitis]], [[endocarditis]] and [[osteitis]]
The fever is still very high and oscillates very little over 24 hours. [[Dehydration]] ensues and the patient is delirious (typhoid state). By the end of third week the fever starts subsiding ([[wikt:defervescence|defervescence]]). This carries on into the fourth and final week.

== Transmission ==
The bacterium which causes typhoid fever may be spread through poor hygiene habits and public sanitation conditions, and sometimes also by flying insects feeding on feces. Public education campaigns encouraging people to wash their hands after defecating and before handling food are an important component in controlling spread of the disease. According to statistics from the United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), the [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] of drinking water has led to dramatic decreases in the transmission of typhoid fever in the U.S.A.

A person may become an [[asymptomatic carrier]] of typhoid fever, suffering no symptoms, but capable of infecting others. According to the CDC approximately 5% of people who contract typhoid continue to carry the disease after they recover.  The most famous asymptomatic carrier was Mary Mallon (commonly known as "[[Typhoid Mary]]"), a young cook who was responsible for infecting at least 53 people with typhoid, three of whom died from the disease.<ref>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title='Typhoid Mary' Dies Of A Stroke At 68. Carrier of Disease, Blamed for 51 Cases and 3 Deaths, but She Was Held Immune |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D15FE3859117389DDAB0994D9415B888FF1D3 |quote=Mary Mallon, the first carrier of typhoid bacilli identified in America and consequently known as Typhoid Mary, died yesterday in Riverside Hospital on North Brother Island.  |work=[[New York Times]] |date=November 12, 1938 |accessdate=2010-02-28 }}</ref>  Mallon was the first apparently perfectly healthy person known to be responsible for a Typhoid "epidemic".

In the early 20th century, many carriers of typhoid were locked into an isolation ward never to be released to prevent further typhoid cases. These people often deteriorated mentally, driven mad by the conditions they lived in.<ref>BBC on Long Grove Hospital Surrey GB url: http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7523000/7523680.stm</ref>

=== Possible protective effects of heterozygosity for cystic fibrosis ===
It has been hypothesized that [[cystic fibrosis]] may have risen to its present levels (1 in 2,500 in UK) due to the [[heterozygous advantage]] that it confers against typhoid fever.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weinberg ED |title=Survival advantage of the hemochromatosis C282Y mutation |journal=Perspectives in biology and medicine |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=98–102 |year=2008 |pmid=18192769 |doi=10.1353/pbm.2008.0001 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/cgi-bin/resolve_openurl.cgi?issn=0031-5982&volume=51&issue=1&spage=98&aulast=Weinberg}}</ref> The [[Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator|CFTR protein]] is present in both the lungs and the intestinal epithelium, and the mutant cystic fibrosis form of the CFTR protein prevents entry of the typhoid bacterium into the body through the intestinal epithelium.  However, the heterozygous advantage hypothesis was proposed in one review in which the author himself writes, "Although cellular/molecular evidence presently is not available for this hypothesis, the CF mutation may be one of several mutations that have spread in European populations because they increased resistance to infectious diseases." Since no molecular experimental evidence has been presented in support of this theory, this theory is not accepted by the majority of the scientific community.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis is made by any [[blood culture|blood]], [[bone marrow]] or [[Human feces|stool]] [[culture]]s and with the [[Widal test]] (demonstration of salmonella [[antibody|antibodies]] against [[antigens]] [[O-somatic]] and [[H-flagellar]]). In [[epidemic]]s and less wealthy countries, after excluding [[malaria]], [[dysentery]] or [[pneumonia]], a therapeutic trial time with [[chloramphenicol]] is generally undertaken while awaiting the results of [[Widal test]] and cultures of the blood and stool.<ref name="Sherris">{{cite book |author=Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors) |title=Sherris Medical Microbiology |edition=4th |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=2004 |isbn=0-8385-8529-9}}</ref>

The [[Widal test]] is time consuming and often, when a diagnosis is reached, it is too late to start an [[antibiotic]] regimen.

The term "enteric fever" is a collective term that refers to typhoid and paratyphoid.<ref name="BMJ2009">{{cite journal|author=Parry CM, Beeching NJ|title=Treatment of enteric fever|year=2009|volume=338|pages=b1159–b1159|doi=10.1136/bmj.b1159|journal=BMJ|pmid=19493937}}</ref>

== Prevention ==
{{main|Typhoid vaccine}}

[[File:Typhoid inoculation2.jpg|thumb|250px|Doctor administering a typhoid [[vaccination]] at a school in [[San Augustine County, Texas]], 1943.]]
[[File:ForskeligeVeje ad hvilkenBroen kan inficeres medTyfusbaciller.png|thumb|250px|A 1939 conceptual illustration showing various ways that typhoid bacteria can contaminate a [[water well]] (center)]]

Sanitation and hygiene are the critical measures that can be taken to prevent typhoid.  Typhoid does not affect animals and therefore transmission is only from human to human.  Typhoid can only spread in environments where human feces or urine are able to come into contact with food or drinking water.  Careful food preparation and washing of hands are crucial to prevent typhoid.

There are two vaccines licensed for use for the prevention of typhoid:<ref name="pmid17636661">{{cite journal |author=Fraser A, Goldberg E, Acosta CJ, Paul M, Leibovici L |title=Vaccines for preventing typhoid fever |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=3 |pages=CD001261 |year=2007 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001261.pub2 |pmid=17636661 |editor1-last=Fraser |editor1-first=Abigail}}</ref> the live, oral [[Ty21a]] vaccine (sold as ''Vivotif Berna'') and the injectable [[Typhoid polysaccharide vaccine]] (sold as ''Typhim Vi'' by Sanofi Pasteur and ''Typherix'' by GlaxoSmithKline). Both are between 50% to 80% protective and are recommended for travellers to areas where typhoid is endemic. Boosters are recommended every five years for the oral vaccine and every two years for the injectable form.  There exists an older killed whole-cell vaccine that is still used in countries where the newer preparations are not available, but this vaccine is no longer recommended for use, because it has a higher rate of side effects (mainly pain and inflammation at the site of the injection).<ref name="pmid17636661"/>

==Medical treatment==
The rediscovery of [[oral rehydration therapy]] in the 1960s provided a simple way to prevent many of the deaths of [[diarrhea]]l diseases in general.

Where resistance is uncommon, the treatment of choice is a [[fluoroquinolone]] such as [[ciprofloxacin]].<ref name="BMJ2009"/><ref name="pmid21975746">{{cite journal |author=Effa EE, Lassi ZS, Critchley JA, ''et al.'' |title=Fluoroquinolones for treating typhoid and paratyphoid fever (enteric fever) |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=10 |pages=CD004530 |year=2011 |pmid=21975746 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004530.pub4 |editor1-last=Bhutta |editor1-first=Zulfiqar A}}</ref> Otherwise, a third-generation cephalosporin such as [[ceftriaxone]] or [[cefotaxime]] is the first choice.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Treatment of typhoid fever and other systemic salmonelloses with cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, and other newer cephalosporins|author=Soe GB, Overturf GD|journal=Rev Infect Dis|volume=9|issue=4|year=1987|pages=719–36|pmid=3125577|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|jstor=4454162|doi=10.1093/clinids/9.4.719}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Wallace MR|title=Ciprofloxacin versus ceftriaxone in the treatment of multiresistant typhoid fever|journal=Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis|volume=12|issue=12|year=1993|doi=10.1007/BF01992163|pages=907–910|pmid=8187784|author-separator=,|author2=Yousif AA|author3=Mahroos GA|display-authors=3|last4=Mapes|first4=T.|last5=Threlfall|first5=E.

Typhoid fever in most cases is not fatal. [[Antibiotics]], such as [[ampicillin]], [[chloramphenicol]],  [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]], [[amoxicillin]] and [[ciprofloxacin]], have been commonly used to treat typhoid fever in microbiology. (''Baron S'' et al.)  Treatment of the disease with antibiotics reduces the case-fatality rate to approximately 1%.<ref>http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/diarrhoeal/en/index7.html</ref>

When untreated, typhoid fever persists for three weeks to a month. Death occurs in between 10% and 30% of untreated cases.<ref name=who/> In some communities, however, case-fatality rates may reach as high as 47%.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Surgical treatment===
Surgery is usually indicated in cases of [[intestinal perforation]]. Most surgeons prefer simple closure of the perforation with drainage of the [[peritoneum]]. Small-bowel resection is indicated for patients with multiple perforations.

If antibiotic treatment fails to eradicate the [[hepatobiliary]] carriage, the [[gallbladder]] should be resected. [[Cholecystectomy]] is not always successful in eradicating the carrier state because of persisting hepatic infection.

===Resistance===
Resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and [[streptomycin]] is now common, and these agents have not been used as first–line treatment now for almost 20 years.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  Typhoid that is resistant to these agents is known as multidrug-resistant typhoid (MDR typhoid).

Ciprofloxacin resistance is an increasing problem, especially in the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]].  Many centres are therefore moving away from using ciprofloxacin as the first line for treating suspected typhoid originating in South America, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Thailand, or Vietnam.  For these patients, the recommended first line treatment is [[ceftriaxone]]. It has also been suggested that [[azithromycin]] is better at treating typhoid in resistant populations than both fluoroquinolone drugs and ceftriaxone.<ref name="pmid21975746"/> Azithromycin significantly reduces relapse rates compared with ceftriaxone.

There is a separate problem with laboratory testing for reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin: current recommendations are that isolates should be tested simultaneously against ciprofloxacin (CIP) and against [[nalidixic acid]] (NAL), and that isolates that are sensitive to both CIP and NAL should be reported as "sensitive to ciprofloxacin", but that isolates testing sensitive to CIP but not to NAL should be reported as "reduced sensitivity to ciprofloxacin".  However, an analysis of 271 isolates showed that around 18% of isolates with a reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ([[Minimum inhibitory concentration|MIC]] 0.125–1.0&nbsp;mg/l) would not be picked up by this method.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Fluoroquinolone resistance in ''Salmonella typhi'' (letter) |author=Cooke FJ, Wain J, Threlfall EJ |journal=Brit Med J |year=2006 |volume=333 |issue=7563 |pages=353–354  |doi=10.1136/bmj.333.7563.353-b |pmid=16902221 |pmc=1539082}}</ref>  It is not certain how this problem can be solved, because most laboratories around the world (including the West) are dependent on [[Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing|disk testing]] and cannot test for MICs.

== History ==
Around 430–424&nbsp;BC, a devastating [[pandemic|plague]], which some believe to have been typhoid fever, killed one third of the population of [[History of Athens|Athens]], including their leader [[Pericles]].  The balance of power shifted from Athens to [[Sparta]], ending the [[Golden Age of Pericles]] that had marked Athenian dominance in the Greek ancient world.  Ancient historian [[Thucydides]] also contracted the disease, but he survived to write about the plague.  His writings are the primary source on this outbreak and modern academics and medical scientists consider [[epidemic typhus]] the most likely cause. However, 2006 study detected [[DNA]] sequences similar to those of the bacterium responsible for typhoid fever.<ref name="Papagrigorakis_2006">{{cite journal |author=Papagrigorakis MJ, Yapijakis C, Synodinos PN, Baziotopoulou-Valavani E |title=DNA examination of ancient dental pulp incriminates typhoid fever as a probable cause of the Plague of Athens |journal=Int J Infect Dis |year=2006 |pages=206–214 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pmid=16412683 |doi=10.1016/j.ijid.2005.09.001 }}</ref>

The most notorious carrier of typhoid fever—but by no means the most destructive—was [[Mary Mallon]], also known as Typhoid Mary. In 1907, she became the first [[United States|American]] carrier to be identified and traced. She was a cook in [[New York]]. She is closely associated with fifty-three cases and three deaths.<ref name="Nova">{{cite web |title=Nova: The Most Dangerous Woman in America |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/typhoid/letter.html}}</ref> Public health authorities told Mary to give up working as a cook or have her [[gall bladder]] removed. Mary quit her job but returned later under a [[Pseudonym|false name]]. She was detained and [[quarantine]]d after another typhoid outbreak. She died of pneumonia after 26 years in quarantine.

In 1880 [[Karl Joseph Eberth]] described a bacillus that he suspected was the cause of typhoid. In 1884 pathologist [[Georg Theodor August Gaffky]] (1850–1918) confirmed Eberth's findings, and the organism was given names such as Eberth's bacillus, Eberthella typhi and Gaffky-Eberth bacillus. Today the bacillus that causes typhoid fever goes by the scientific name of ''[[Salmonella enterica enterica]]'', serovar Typhi.

[[Almroth Edward Wright]] developed an effective inactivated whole-cell typhoid vaccine that was introduced in 1896.<ref name="pmid17636661"/> In 1909, [[Frederick F. Russell]], a [[U.S. Army]] physician, developed an American typhoid vaccine and two years later his vaccination program became the first in which an entire army was immunized.

Most developed countries saw declining rates of typhoid fever throughout the first half of the 20th century due to vaccinations and advances in public sanitation and hygiene. In 1908, the chlorination of drinking water was a significant step in the control of typhoid fever in the U.S.  The first permanent disinfection of drinking water in the U.S. occurred on the [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] water supply.  Credit for the decision to build the chlorination system has been given to [[John L. Leal]]<ref>Leal, John L. (1909). “The Sterilization Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company at Boonton, N.J.” ''Proceedings American Water Works Association.'' pp. 100-9.</ref> The [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] facility was designed by [[George W.

Today, the incidence of typhoid fever in developed countries is around 5 cases per 1,000,000 people per year.

[[Aberdeen typhoid outbreak 1964|A notable outbreak]] occurred in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]] in 1964. This was due to contaminated tinned meat sold at the city's branch of the [[William Low]] chain of stores. No fatalies resulted.

An outbreak in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in 2004–05 recorded more than 42,000 cases and 214 deaths.<ref name="who" />

Typhoid fever was also known as ''suette milliaire'' in nineteenth-century France.
