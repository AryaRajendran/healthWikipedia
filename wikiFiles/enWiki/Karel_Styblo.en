==Personal life==
Styblo was born in Klaster, Czechoslovakia in 1921.<ref name=Walton/> Toward the end of World War II, he was imprisoned at the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] in Austria, where he contracted [[tuberculosis]].<ref name= StopTB>{{cite web |url= http://www.stoptb.org/assets/documents/events/meetings/partners_forum/2001/tb50_50.pdf |format= PDF |publisher= World Health Organization |work= Stop TB Partnership |year = 2001 |title= Partners forum: 50-50 |accessdate= 28 March 2012}}</ref> After his recovery and release, Styblo entered [[Charles University in Prague]]. During his medical studies the tuberculosis infection acquired in Mauthausen reactivated and he was admitted and treated at Bulovka Hospital in Prague from October 1948 till April 1950.<ref>{{Personal correspondence with son Charles Styblo, September 2012}}</ref> After earning his medical degree in 1950, he returned to Bulovka Hospital to become a chest physician, followed by five years of postgraduate study at the Tuberculosis Research Institute.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Obituaries say Styblo studied under Sir [[John Crofton]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]], Scotland in the 1950s;<ref name=Walton/><ref name=StopTB/> the IUATLD says Crofton and Styblo worked together in Edinburgh in the early 50s.<ref name=History>{{cite web |url= http://www.theunion.org/index.php/en/who-are-we/history-of-the-union |title= History of The Union | publisher= International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease |accessdate= 30 March 2012}}</ref> Crofton said in an interview that they met in 1960 while Styblo was still in Czechoslovakia.<ref name=WHOObit/> Of Styblo, Crofton said:<blockquote>He was a quiet man, but wonderfully persistent and an enormous worker. Several east African countries had asked for help with tuberculosis and Styblo was sent there. He proved to have a genius for persuading governments that tuberculosis was a major economic problem as well as a public health concern. He was also able to convince them that they could handle diagnosis and treatment through their routine health services, without special tuberculosis clinics and services. Above all he stressed the importance of monitoring patients throughout the course of treatment, as he had seen done in Edinburgh.<ref name= WHOObit>{{cite journal |author=Sir [[John Crofton]] |title=Fighting resistance |journal=Bull.

Styblo moved to the Netherlands after the unsuccessful [[Prague Spring]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jata.or.jp/rit/re/13kiyose.htm |title = Newsletter from Kiyose |publisher= The Research Institute of Tuberculosis, Japan |date= No. 13, October 1998 |accessdate= 28 March 2012}}</ref> and became a Dutch citizen in 1971.<ref name=Walton/> He was still active when he died suddenly on 13 March 1998 at the age of 76;<ref name=StopTB/> his wife, Lida, predeceased him.<ref name=Walton/>

==Career==
Styblo's life's work was to develop, pioneer, and demonstrate the "proof of principle" for the strategy used to control TB by the [[World Bank]] and promulgated by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).<ref name=Obermeyer>{{cite journal |author=Obermeyer Z, Abbott-Klafter J, Murray CJ |title=Has the DOTS strategy improved case finding or treatment success?

In a historical review of tuberculosis, Murray (2004) writes:<blockquote>In the mid-1970s, a redoubtable Czech, Karel Styblo, harnessed the meager resources of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and showed that, contrary to expert opinion, tuberculosis could be controlled in extremely poor countries: beginning in Tanzania, one of the poorest of them all.<ref name=Murray/></blockquote>

According to the [[World Health Organization]]:<blockquote>The role of Dr Karel Styblo, IUAT Scientific Director, in the development of these innovative programmes cannot be understated. He combined an astonishing knowledge of the epidemiology of TB with a remarkable understanding of the management principles of TB control and a tenacious commitment to excellence in his work. His contribution to TB was immense, and he will go down in history as the father of modern TB control and one of the heroes of public health of the 20th century. The principles developed by him in Africa were later adapted and promoted by WHO as DOTS, and adopted in places as diverse as China, New York, and India.<ref name= WorldsCollide>{{cite book |url=http://www.stoptb.org/assets/documents/global/plan/GLOBAL_PLAN_TO_STOP_TB_2001_2005.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=World Health Organization | title=The Global Plan to Stop TB (2000 - 2005) |chapter=Chapter 2: When worlds collide: the power and potential of DOTS |year=2002 |accessdate=28 March 2012}} (see also the [http://www.stoptb.org/assets/documents/global/plan/TB_GlobalPlanToStopTB2011-2015.pdf 2011 - 2015 version])</ref></blockquote>

Styblo was responsible for a guiding [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] rule of thumb for TB known as "Styblo's rule", which stated that "an annual incidence of 50 sputum-smear-positive TB cases in a population of 100,000 generates an annual risk of infection of 1%" (the rule is no longer used to estimate [[prevalence]] of TB).<ref name=Dye>{{cite journal |author= [[Christopher Dye|Dye, Christopher]] |url=http://www.scielosp.org/pdf/bwho/v86n1/04.pdf |format=PDF |title=Breaking a law: tuberculosis disobeys Styblo's rule |journal=Bull. World Health Organ. [online] |year=2008 |volume=86 |issue=1 |page=4 |issn=0042-9686}}</ref>  He was also responsible for instituting a systematic feedback method for analyzing outcomes of TB cases, known as the "cohort review" principle (CR), which was adopted in London and outside of the UK.<ref name=CohortReview>{{cite journal |title=P61 Karel Styblo comes to town: staff perspectives on TB cohort review |journal=Thorax |year=2011 |volume=66 |page=A93 |doi= 10.1136/thoraxjnl-2011-201054c.61}}</ref>
