'''Pruritus ani''' (also known as '''anusitis''') is the irritation of the skin at the exit of the [[rectum]], known as the [[anus]], causing the desire to scratch.<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''. (10th ed.). Saunders. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref> The intensity of anal [[itch]]ing increases from moisture,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} pressure, and rubbing caused by clothing and sitting. At worst, anal itching causes intolerable discomfort that often is accompanied by burning and soreness.  It is estimated that up to 5% of the population of the United States experiences this type of discomfort daily.

==Causes==

The irritation can be caused by intestinal parasites, anal [[perspiration]], frequent liquid stools, [[diarrhea]], residual stool deposits, or the escape of small amounts of stool as a result of [[Fecal incontinence|incontinence]] or [[flatulence]]. Another cause is [[yeast infection]] or [[Candidiasis]]. Some diseases increase the possibility of yeast infections, such as [[diabetes mellitus]] or [[HIV]] infection. Treatment with [[antibiotic]]s can bring about a disturbance of the natural balance of intestinal flora, and lead to perianal [[thrush]], a [[yeast infection]], affecting the anus. [[Psoriasis]] also can be present in the anal area and cause irritation. Abnormal passageways ([[fistula]]s) from the small intestine or colon to the skin surrounding the anus can form as a result of disease (such as [[Crohn's disease]]), acting as channels which may allow leakage of irritating fluids to the anal area. Other problems that can contribute to anal itching include [[pinworms]], [[hemorrhoid]]s, tears of the anal skin near the mucocutaneous junction ([[Anal fissure|fissures]]), and [[skin tag]]s (abnormal local growth of anal skin).
Anal itching is conjectured to be possibly caused by irritating chemicals in foods consumed, but no clinical evidence based on scientific enquiry has been asserted to demonstrate this.

Some authorities describe “psychogenic pruritus” or "functional itch disorder" [http://www.medicaljournals.se/acta/content/download.php?doi=10.2340/00015555-0266], where psychological factors may contribute to awareness of itching.

The helminth (worm) Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm, or threadworm) can cause severe pruritus ani from migration of gravid females (from the bowel), leading to haemorrhage and eczema.

==Treatment==
For pruritus ani of unknown cause treatment typically begins with measures to reduce irritation and trauma to the perianal area.<ref name=NA10>{{cite journal|last=Markell|first=KW|coauthors=Billingham, RP|title=Pruritus ani: etiology and management.|journal=The Surgical clinics of North America|date=2010 Feb|volume=90|issue=1|pages=125–35, Table of Contents|pmid=20109637}}</ref> [[Stool softener]]s can help prevent constipation.<ref name=NA10/> If this is not effective topical [[steroids]] or injected [[methylene blue]] may be tried.<ref name=NA10/> If the itchiness is secondary to another condition such as infection or psoriasis these are typically treated.<ref name=NA10/>
