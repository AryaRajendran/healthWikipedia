'''Baby Gender Mentor''' is the [[trade name]] of a controversial [[blood test]] designed for [[prenatal sex discernment]], that is, to determine whether a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman is carrying a male or female child. The test is made by Acu-Gen Biolab, Inc., a [[biotechnology|biotech]] company in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], [[United States]], and is marketed to detect the sex of a [[fetus]] as early as five weeks after [[Fertilisation|conception]].<ref name="Associated Press - Moms sue">{{cite news | url=http://news.aol.com/article/baby-sex-tests-lawsuit/528219 | title=Moms Sue, Saying Baby Sex Tests Flawed | publisher=Associated Press | date=June 19, 2009 | accessdate=June 16, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090619120142/http://news.aol.com/article/baby-sex-tests-lawsuit/528219?| archivedate= 19 June 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name="Pew Charitable Trust">{{cite web | url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=19814 | publisher=Pew Charitable Trust | title=Gender Bender | accessdate=July 29, 2009}}</ref><ref name="BGM - Guide ">{{cite web | url=http://babygendermentor.com/information.php?information_id=1 | title=Step by Step Guide to Baby Gender Mentor Test | publisher=BabyGenderMentor.com | accessdate=July 29, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://babygendermentor.com/information.php?information_id=4 | title=A Total Advantage | publisher=Babygendermentor.com | accessdate=January 16, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070202131214/http://babygendermentor.com/information.php?information_id=4| archivedate= 2 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  The test made a prominent media debut on 17 June 2005 on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]''<ref name="Newhouse">{{Failed verification|date=August 2009}}{{cite news | title=Parents May Welcome Baby Gender Test, But Bioethicists Worry | author=O'Crowley, Peggy | url=http://www.newhousenews.com/archive/ocrowley071105.html  | year=2005 | publisher=Newhouse News Service|accessdate=January 16, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060427041104/http://www.newhousenews.com/archive/ocrowley071105.html |archivedate = April 27, 2006}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}<ref name="Today-flash">{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}{{cite web | url=http://www.webantidote.com/pregnancystore/today_show_flash/ | title=Today Show video segment | publisher=PregnancyStore.com | format=Flash | accessdate=July 18, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060203015704/http://www.webantidote.com/pregnancystore/today_show_flash/ |archivedate = February 3, 2006}}</ref><ref name="Globe">{{cite news | title=Test reveals gender early in pregnancy | work=The Boston Globe | date= June 27, 2005 | author=Goldberg, Carey | accessdate=January 16, 2007 | url=http://www.boston.com/yourlife/health/women/articles/2005/06/27/test_reveals_gender_early_in_pregnancy/| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070224111955/http://www.boston.com/yourlife/health/women/articles/2005/06/27/test_reveals_gender_early_in_pregnancy/| archivedate= 24 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and it was featured in Newsweek in October 2005.<ref name="Pew Charitable Trust"/><ref name="Newsweek"/> About 4,500 people had purchased the test by March 2006.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news | url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2006/03/19/2003298170 | title=Parents sue manufacturer of Baby Gender Mentor | work=The Taipei Times / The Guardian, Washington | date= March 16, 2006 | accessdate=July 17, 2006}}</ref>

The test and its competitors represent an alternative to medical procedures which determine the sex of the fetus, such as [[amniocentesis]] and [[ultrasound]]. One possible advantage of using blood tests for prenatal sex testing is the minimally invasive nature of this method. In contrast, there are small, demonstrated risks associated with amniocentesis, and some authorities believe that there could be theoretical risks associated with ultrasound.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Church CC, Miller MW |title=Quantification of risk from fetal exposure to diagnostic ultrasound |journal=Prog.

According to the Baby Gender Mentor  web site,<ref name="BGM-Science"/> the test involves using [[real-time polymerase chain reaction]] and a proprietary technology to detect markers on the [[Y-chromosome]], which can be isolated from the pregnant woman's blood if the fetus is male.

==Test methodology==
Acu-Gen say that after eight weeks, accuracy is consistent throughout the pregnancy and the test may be taken at any time. The test kit costs [[United States dollar|US$]]25.00. To use, the pregnant woman pricks her finger to draw a small amount of blood, which is placed on card; the card is placed in the kit and sent to Acu-Gen, where the test is processed for an additional US$250 fee.<ref name="NY Daily News"/><ref name="how">{{cite web | url=http://babygendermentor.com/information.php?information_id=5 | title=Prick finger and collect blood | publisher=Babygendermentor.com| accessdate=January 16, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070202094115/http://babygendermentor.com/information.php?information_id=5| archivedate= 2 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

According to the company, the Baby Gender Mentor laboratory analysis will report one of four possible results to the pregnant woman: Male, Female, Twins, or Inconclusive. A result of "Male" indicates that only male fetal [[DNA]] was present and so the pregnant woman must be carrying one or more boys. Similarly, a result of "Female" indicates that only female fetal DNA was detected and the woman is expecting one or more girls. If the result is "Twins" then both male and female fetal DNA were detected and the pregnancy includes one or more boys and one or more girls. If the test is "Inconclusive" then Acu-Gen refers the customer to their [[warranty]] policy and procedure.<ref name="Agu-Gen FAQ">{{cite web | url=http://babygendermentor.com/information.php?information_id=6 | title=FAQ—Is The Baby Gender Mentor Test Right For Me? | publisher=BabyGenderMentor.com | accessdate=January 22, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070202111312/http://babygendermentor.com/information.php?information_id=6| archivedate= 2 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Also interviewed was Sherry Bonelli, the CEO of PregnancyStore.com, an [[Illinois]]-based on-line retailer where Osburn purchased her test.  Bonelli said that the test had only been available for two weeks and that numerous people had inquired about it in that short time. She also said that Acu-Gen had followed 2,000 pregnancies through to completion and that the lab results given by the Baby Gender Mentor had never been wrong in those trials.{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}<ref name="Today-flash" /> She did not mention how these 2,000 pregnancies are related to the 20,000 pregnancies mentioned separately by Acu-Gen.{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}<ref name="Today-flash" />{{Failed verification|date=August 2009}}<ref name="Science-Mag" />

Osburn said that she wanted to know the sex of her baby because her house was filled with "pink and purples and lots of green" and she wanted to know whether to paint the nursery blue. She had agreed to have her test results announced to her on the show, and Bonelli informed her that she was going to have a girl, according to the results of the test.{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}<ref name="Today-flash" />

Wapner said that one positive aspect of the Baby Gender Mentor test is the non-invasive nature of the test, which means there should be no risk of harm to the fetus.{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}<ref name="Today-flash" />

==Accuracy of the test disputed==
At least 40&nbsp;women have come forward to say their Baby Gender Mentor tests predicted the wrong sex.<ref name="Parents sue"/> According to a [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) report, the company has explained certain inaccurate results as being the result of a [[vanishing twin]], a fetus that stopped growing soon after fertilization.<ref name="Boyce2" /> Vanishing Twin Syndrome occurs when one of the fetuses in a [[twin]] pregnancy spontaneously aborts, usually during the first trimester. The fetal tissue is absorbed by either the other twin, the [[placenta]], or the mother, thus giving the appearance that the twin "vanished". This usually results in a normal, "single" pregnancy.  Vanishing twins would theoretically explain apparent errors in the Baby Gender Mentor test:  if fraternal twins, one male and female, were present when the test was taken, the test should indicate the presence of a male embryo and a female embryo;  when the male embryo later "vanishes", leaving the female baby to develop normally, the test would appear to be in error, despite being accurate at the time.

The medical community is not in agreement about how frequently vanishing-twin phenomena occurs.<ref name=Landy_1998>{{cite journal |author=Landy H, Keith L |title=The vanishing twin: a review |journal=Hum Reprod Update |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=177–83 |year=1998 |pmid=9683354 |doi=10.1093/humupd/4.2.177}}</ref>

However, even if vanishing twins are assumed to be a common occurrence, they do not explain all of the apparent incorrect results.  According to Acu-Gen's website, they can predict a mixed sex set of fraternal twins, so the test should have predicted twins instead of predicting a single baby whose sex turned out to be incorrect.<ref name="Agu-Gen FAQ"/>

With Acu-Gen choosing not to publish proof of its claims and evidence of several women receiving inaccurate predictions, doctors are concerned about the test.  Among the [[scientific evidence]] cited by Acu-Gen's web site is a paper co-authored by Diana Bianchi, an expert on fetal [[DNA]] at [[Tufts University]]. The NPR story quoted Bianchi as saying, "I think at the present time we need to be concerned whether the test is accurate or not", and "I think it's [[caveat emptor]]. Let the buyer beware."<ref name = "Boyce1" />  Another criticism has come from Sandra Carson, professor of [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrics and gynecology]] and involved in research in sex selection. Carson says, "Until Acu-Gen releases its data, there's no way to know the test's reliability.  Until that's out, I think it shouldn't be on the market."<ref name="Wash-Post">{{cite news | author=Ault, Alicia | date= July 19, 2005 | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/18/AR2005071801128.html | title=The Gender Flap |work=The Washington Post | accessdate=October 21, 2005}}</ref>  Carson at that time was at the [[Baylor College of Medicine]].<ref name="Wash-Post"/>  Dr. [[Charles Lockwood (gynecologist)|Charles Lockwood]], chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at [[Yale School of Medicine]], said that it is possible for fetal DNA to be found in maternal blood as soon as the placenta has developed, and that detection after five weeks "is not impossible" and the president of Acu-Gen said the suit was "totally bogus".<ref name="Parents sue"/>

===Concerns about sex selection===
The National Public Radio investigative report on Acu-Gen predicted that parents may use the Baby Gender Mentor test as a basis for determining whether to get a [[sex-selective abortion]].<ref name="Boyce2" /> [[KMSP-TV]] interviewed [[Genetic counseling|genetic counselor]] Dr. Analia Bortz who made the same prediction.{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}<ref name="Fox9">{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}{{cite news | url=http://www.kmsp.com/news/health/story.asp?1649175 | title=Baby Gender Mentor | publisher=Fox9 News | year=2006|accessdate=July 17, 2006}}</ref>  The concern is that learning the sex at such an early point may lead parents to terminate the pregnancy if they were hoping for a baby of the opposite sex to that indicated by the test. [[Americans United for Life]] argues that women disappointed by the result of their test would find it easier to have an abortion if they get the results early. They say that women who want to have a specific sex will be learning the results at a time when it is safer for them to have an abortion, without the complications associated with aborting later in pregnancy.<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite news | title=Revolutionary foetus sex test raises eugenics fears | author=Langton, James | work=Daily Telegraph | date= October 7, 2005 }}</ref>

===Alleged use for medical diagnoses===
Acu-Gen's website specifically states that the test is not a medical test:
{{cquote|Acu-Gen Biolab, Inc. (“Acu-Gen”) and the www.babygendermentor.com website (“Web Site”) do not offer medical advice or professional services.  The products and information provided with the Baby Gender Mentor Test '''cannot''' and '''should not''' be used for diagnosing or treating a known or suspected health condition or illness.

Tests similar to the Baby Gender Mentor test can be used for medical diagnoses.  For instance, scientists have shown that it is possible to use fetal DNA from a woman's blood to screen the fetus for [[Genetic disorder|genetic defects]] such as [[Down syndrome]].  In a validation study sponsored by the National Institute for Child Health and Development, 5 different labs used fetal cells from maternal blood to search for evidence of Down syndrome in 2,744 pregnancies.  On average, the labs correctly spotted Down syndrome babies 74% of the time.<ref name="Science-Mag" />

In at least one case, Chang Wang, the president of Acu-Gen, has phoned a pregnant woman one month after giving her the sex prediction to inform her that her test indicated an "excess of [[genetic material]] in her blood" and advised her to see her doctor in order "to rule out problems like Down's syndrome or Trisomy 18". Wang explains this means "with a certain possibility, that her fetus has a kind of genetic problem. Of course later on, we had used our technology to prove that she has a chromosome problem: [[Edwards syndrome|Trisomy 18]].  That means that this baby [is] going to have a developmental problem and is going to probably cease to exist right after the birth."    Dr. Diana Bianchi of Tufts disputes the possibility of the test being used for such a diagnosis. She says, "The test involves looking at genetic sequences on the [[X chromosome]] and the Y chromosome. If he gave a diagnosis of Trisomy 18, that involves a different chromosome, [[Chromosome 18]]. That is certainly something that is not advertised in the packaging associated with the test. "It is possible that, upon being told of a problem by Acu-Gen, a woman may seek to have an amniocentesis or other [[invasive (medical)|invasive procedure]] which may be an unnecessary risk if the Acu-Gen diagnosis was in error.<ref name="NJSL">{{cite news |  title=Prenatal test reveals more than gender | work=The Star-Ledger|date=October 31, 2005 }}</ref> In this case, the woman delivered a healthy baby free from both Trisomy 18 and Down syndrome.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The class action lawsuit filed by Gainey & McKenna alleges that Acu-Gen is improperly dispensing medical advice.  The law firm claims Wang has contacted "many women" and advised them that their fetuses have chromosomal  abnormalities.  They claim that Dr. Wang, who is listed as a Ph.D., is providing women "with all sorts of medical advice and diagnoses". They say their clients have suffered great [[Negligent infliction of emotional distress|emotional distress]] and have undergone unnecessary medical testing based upon Dr. Wang's "advice".<ref name="Allegations"/>

==Warranty and availability==
Acu-Gen has allegedly created new requirements for people who want to take advantage of the money-back guarantee.{{Verify credibility|date=August 2009}}<!--this is a commercial sales blog--><ref name="balks">{{Verify credibility|date=August 2009}}{{cite web | url=http://www.in-gender.com/cs/blogs/Gender_Selection_News/archive/2005/12/29/4559.aspx | title=Acu-Gen balks at giving refunds for birth certificates showing Baby Gender Mentor was wrong |  publisher=InGender.com | date=December 30, 2005 | accessdate=January 19, 2007}}</ref> The attorney Barry Gainey, of Gainey & McKenna, says that Chang Wang, Acu-Gen's President, is "making people send in the original [[birth certificate]].

None of those requirements were on the boxes shipped to early customers, but the requirements have since appeared on Acu-Gen's website.<ref name="Parents sue">{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=1668125 | title=ABC News: Parents Sue Over Pregnancy Test Said to Tell Baby's Sex | author=Zand M.D., Sarvenaz|date=February 26, 2006 | accessdate=January 19, 2007}}</ref>  Gainey has filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of 40&nbsp;people who claim they received inaccurate results but were unable to obtain refunds from Acu-Gen.<ref name="Parents sue"/>

There have been conflicting reports about how often the company has refunded money to consumers who received an erroneous result with the test.  In February 2006, Wang said, "We don't mistakes {{sic}}.

Their website states:
{{cquote|To date, Acu-Gen has issued 200% refund checks to a few customers—NOT for incorrectly identifying the baby's gender at birth, though. Two are for cases involving vanishing twins, one case due to insufficient blood sample, two cases caused by incomplete reactions and three reversal cases of no obvious reasons.

In March 2006, Wang wrote in an [[e-mail]] to NPR, he has "decided to defer all his energies regarding the BGM product and service for one more year, when results of actual births compared to the results provided by Baby Gender Mentor should answer any concern about the accuracy of the test."<ref name="Revisit" />

Initial news reports and the Acu-Gen website touted a 200% money-back guarantee.<ref name="Newsweek"/> In May 2006, Baby Gender Mentor website was modified to show a different warranty than the one that had originally promised to refund 200% of the purchase price of the test.  The new warranty states:

==About Acu-Gen==
Acu-Gen is a biotech company in Lowell, Massachusetts and is led by Chang-ning Wang, the company's President.  A National Public Radio reporter visited the address given as the headquarters of Acu-Gen in September 2005.  They found that the building at that address contains a [[Hindu|Hindu temple]] and a company called [[BioTronics]], but no sign for Acu-Gen.  According to NPR, their inquiries at BioTronics revealed the two companies have common ownership, but no one was available to comment for the NPR story.<ref name="Boyce2" />  Acu-Gen does not mention a direct link to [[BioTronics]] in their marketing materials.  However, they do state on their web-site that they utilize BioTronics' [[BioTronics|AmpliSensor]] technology, according to the Baby Gender Mentor website.<ref name="BGM-Science"/> AmpliSensor is a real-time quantitative PCR assay invented by Wang and marketed by BioTronics, according to the Baby Gender Mentor website.<ref name="BGM-Science"/>{{Failed verification|date=August 2009}}<ref>{{Failed verification|date=August 2009}}{{cite web | url=http://www.biotech-register.com/listcogo.cfm?state=MA&company=Biotronics%5ECorporation&defn=POLYMERASE-CHAIN-REACTION&code=ASSA%20POJH | title=Biotronics corporation | publisher=Biotech-register.com | accessdate=January 19, 2007}}</ref>

A news crew from television station [[WFTS]], an [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) affiliate, visited the Acu-Gen offices in February 2006.  They found "about six employees inside Wang's lab, some putting together sex test kits, others doing some type of lab work. There was a room full of machines Chang said he created, and shelves stacked with blood samples supposedly sent in by women from across the United States."  BioTronics does make a [[Laboratory equipment|laboratory instrument]] known as an AG-9600 AmpliSensor Analyzer, which is used for [[quantitative property|quantitative]] DNA analysis.<ref>{{Cite patent|US|6033854}}  Full text at:{{cite web | url=http://www.patentgenius.com/patent/6033854.html | title=U.S. Patent No 6,033,854—Quantitative PCR using blocking oligonucleotides | work=PatentGenius.com | author=Kurnit, DM, Chiang PW, Wang CNJ.|date=March 7, 2000 | accessdate=January 21, 2007}}</ref>
