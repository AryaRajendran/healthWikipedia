A '''ranula''' is a type of [[mucocele]] found on the floor of the mouth.  Ranulas present as a [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of [[connective tissue]] consisting of collected [[mucin]] from a ruptured [[salivary gland]] [[Duct (anatomy)|duct]], which is usually caused by local trauma. If they are small and not problematic, then they are left alone, but otherwise minor [[oral surgery]] may be required (usually removal of the [[sublingual gland]]).

==Classification==
A ranula is a type of mucocele, and therefore could be classified as a disorder of the salivary glands. Usually a ranula is confined to the [[floor of mouth|floor of the mouth]] (termed a "simple ranula").<ref name="Salivary gland surg website">{{cite web|last=Shaw|first=JHF|title=Salivary Gland Surgery|url=http://www.jameshfshaw.co.nz/salivary-gland-surgery|publisher=unsupplied|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref> An unusual variant is the cervical ranula (also called a plunging or diving ranula), where the swelling is in the neck rather than the floor of the mouth.<ref name="OMF path textbook">{{cite book|last=Bouquot|first=Brad W. Neville , Douglas D. Damm, Carl M. Allen, Jerry E.|title=Oral & maxillofacial pathology|year=2002|publisher=W.B.

The etymology of the term is usually explained by a resemblance with the underbelly,<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> or the bulging throat of a croaking frog.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rao|first=PLNG|title=Problem Based Approach in Pediatric Surgery|publisher=Jaypee Brothers Publishers|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=8171795498|page=109}}</ref> Alternatively, ranula is described as being derived from the Greek word for "the swollen area below the mouth of a frog".<ref name="Salivary gland surg website" />

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Ranula.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Ranula in a female]]

A ranual usually presents as a translucent blue, dome-shaped, [[wikt:fluctuation|fluctuant]] swelling in the tissues of the floor of the mouth. If the lesion is deeper, then there is a greater thickness of tissue separating from the oral cavity and the blue translucent appearance may not be a feature. A ranula can develop into a large lesion many centimeters in diameter, with resultant elevation of the tongue and possibly interfering with swallowing ([[dysphagia]]). The swelling is not fixed, may not show blanching and is non-painful unless it becomes secondarily infected. The usual location is usually is lateral to the midline, which may be used to help distinguish it from a midline dermoid cyst.<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> A cervical ranula presents as a swelling in the neck, with or without a swelling in the mouth. In common with other mucoceles, ranulas may rupture and then cause recurrent swelling. Ranulas may be asymptomatic, although they can fluctuate rapidly in size, shrinking and swelling, making them hard to detect. 

==Causes==
Minor trauma to the floor of the mouth is thought to damage the delicate ducts that drain saliva from the sublingual gland into the oral cavity.<ref name="OMFS handbook" /> The lesion is a [[Mucous cyst of the oral mucosa|mucous extravasation cyst]] (mucocele) of the floor of mouth, although a ranula is often larger than other mucoceles (mainly because the overlying mucosa is thicker).<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> They can grow so large that they fill the mouth. The most usual source of the [[mucin]] spillage is the sublingual salivary gland, but ranulas may also arise from the [[submandibular duct]] or the [[Salivary glands#minor salivary glands|minor salivary glands]] in the floor of the mouth. A cervical ranula occurs when the spilled mucin dissects its way through the [[mylohyoid muscle]],<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> which separates the [[sublingual space]] from the [[submandibular space]], and creates a swelling in the neck. It may occur following rupture of a simple ranula.<ref name="La'Porte 2011" /> Rarely, ranulas may extend backwards into the [[parapharyngeal space]].<ref name="La'Porte 2011" />

==Diagnosis==
The [[histology|histologic]] appearance is similar to [[mucocele]]s from other locations. The spilled mucin causes a granulation tissue to form, which usually contains foamy [[histiocyte]]s.<ref name="OMF path textbook" /> [[Ultrasound]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] may be useful to image the lesion.<ref name="La'Porte 2011">{{cite journal|last=La'Porte|first=S.

==Treatment==
Treatment of ranulas usually involves removal of the sublingual gland. Surgery may not be required if the ranula is small and asymptomatic.<ref name="OMFS handbook">{{cite book|last=Newlands|first=edited by Cyrus Kerawala, Carrie|title=Oral and maxillofacial surgery|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199204830|page=199}}</ref> [[Marsupialization]] may sometimes be used, where the intra-oral lesion is opened to the oral cavity with the aim of allowing the sublingual gland to re-establish connection with the oral cavity, but it is often unsuccessful.<ref name="OMF path textbook" />  

==Epidemiology==
The lesion is usually present in children.<ref name="OMFS handbook" /> Ranulas are the most common pathologic lesion associated with the sublingual glands.<ref name="Hupp 2008">{{cite book|last=Hupp JR, Ellis E, Tucker MR|title=Contemporary oral and maxillofacial surgery|year=2008|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=9780323049030|pages=410–411|edition=5th}}</ref>
