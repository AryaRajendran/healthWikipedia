The '''homeostatic model assessment''' (HOMA) is a method used to quantify [[insulin resistance]] and [[beta-cell]] function. It was first described under the name HOMA by Matthews ''et al.'' in 1985.

==Derivation==
The HOMA authors used data from physiological studies to develop mathematical equations describing glucose regulation as a feedback loop.

They published computer software that solves the equations, so that insulin resistance and β-cell function can be estimated from fasting glucose and insulin levels.  They also published an equation (see below) that gave approximately the same answers as an early version of the computer software.

The computer model has since been improved to a HOMA2 model<ref name="Rudenski">

In this updated version it is possible to determine insulin sensitivity and β-cell function from paired fasting plasma glucose and [[radioimmunoassay]] insulin, specific insulin, or C-peptide concentrations. The authors recommend the computer software be used wherever possible.

==Notes==
The HOMA model was originally designed as a special case of a more general model called [[HOMA-CIGMA]].<ref>Turner et al. (1993) ''Measurement of insulin resistance and β-cell function: the HOMA and CIGMA approach.'' Current topics in diabetes research (eds) F. Belfiore, R. Bergman and G. Molinatti Front Diabetes. Basel, Karger 12: 66-75</ref>

The approximating equation for insulin resistance, in the early model, used a fasting plasma sample, and was derived by use of the [[insulin]]-[[glucose]] product, divided by a constant: (assuming normal-weight, normal subjects < 35 years, having 100% β-cell function an insulin resistance of 1)

'''IR''' is insulin resistance and ''' %β ''' is the β-cell function.
Insulin is given in [[Insulin_therapy#The_dosage_units|mU/L]]. Glucose and insulin are both during fasting.<ref name="Mathews1985"/>

This model correlated well with estimates using the [[Insulin_resistance#Measuring_insulin_resistance|euglycemic clamp method]] (r = 0.88).<ref name="Mathews1985"/>

The authors have tested HOMA extensively against other measures of insulin resistance (or its reciprocal, insulin sensitivity) and β-cell function.<ref name="Wallace2004"/>
