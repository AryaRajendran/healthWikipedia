'''Symptomatic treatment''' is any [[medicine|medical]] therapy of a [[disease]] that only affects its [[symptom]]s, not its cause, i.e., its [[etiology]]. It is usually aimed at reducing the signs and symptoms for the comfort and well-being of the patient, but it also may be useful in reducing organic consequences and [[sequela]]e of these signs and symptoms of the disease. In many diseases, even in those whose etiologies are known (e.g., most [[viral disease]]s, such as [[influenza]]), symptomatic treatment is the only one available so far.

Examples of symptomatic treatments:

* [[Analgesic]]s, for [[pain]]
* [[Anti-inflammatory]] agents, for [[inflammation]] caused by [[arthritis]]
* [[Antitussive]]s, for [[cough]]
* [[Antihistaminic]]s, for [[allergy]]
* [[Cerebral shunt]]s, to alleviate [[hydrocephalus]]

When the etiology for the disease is known, then specific treatment may be instituted, but it is generally associated to symptomatic treatment, as well.

Symptomatic treatment is not always recommended, and in fact it may be outright dangerous, because it may mask the presence of an underlying etiology which will then be forgotten or treated with great delay. Examples:

* Low-grade [[fever]] for 15 days or more sometimes is the only symptom of [[bacteremia]] by [[staphylococcus]] bacteria. Suppressing it by symptomatic treatment will hide the disease from effective diagnosis and treatment with [[antibiotics]]. The consequence may be severe ([[rheumatic fever]], [[nephritis]], [[endocarditis]], etc.)
* Chronic [[headache]] may be caused simply by a constitutional disposition or be the result of a [[brain tumor]] or a [[brain aneurysm]].

Finally, symptomatic treatment is not exempt of [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effect]]s, and may be a cause of [[iatrogenic]] consequences (i.e., ill effects caused by the treatment itself), such as [[allergic reaction]]s, stomach [[bleeding]], [[central nervous system]] effects ([[nausea]], [[dizziness]], etc.).
