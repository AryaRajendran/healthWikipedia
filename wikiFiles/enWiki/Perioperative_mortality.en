'''Perioperative mortality''' is [[death|mortality]] in relation to [[surgery]], often defined as death within two weeks of a surgical procedure.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} An important consideration in the decision to perform any surgical procedure is to weigh the benefits against the risks. [[Anesthesiologist]]s and [[surgeon]]s employ various methods in assessing whether a patient is in optimal condition from a medical standpoint prior to undertaking surgery, and various statistical tools are available.

==Intraoperative causes==
Complications during surgery, e.g. [[bleeding]] or perforation of organs may have lethal sequelae.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Postoperative causes==

===Infectious complications===
Local infection of the operative field is prevented by using [[asepsis|sterile technique]], and [[Chemoprophylaxis|prophylactic antibiotics]] are often given in abdominal surgery or patients known to have a heart defect or [[Artificial heart valve|mechanical heart valves]] that are at risk of developing [[endocarditis]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Thromboembolic complications===
Examples are [[deep vein thrombosis]] and [[pulmonary embolism]], the risk of which can be mitigated by certain interventions, such as the administration of [[anticoagulant]]s (e.g., [[warfarin]] or [[low molecular weight heparin]]s), [[antiplatelet drug]]s (e.g., [[aspirin]]), [[compression stockings]], and [[Sequential compression device|cyclical pneumatic calf compression]] in high risk patients.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Pulmonary complications===
Many factors can influence the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC).  (A major PPC can be defined as a postoperative pneumonia, respiratory failure, or the need for reintubation after extubation at the end of an anesthetic.  Minor post-operative pulmonary complications include events such as atelectasis, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, and unanticipated need for supplemental oxygen therapy after the initial postoperative period.) <ref>{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=M.W.|coauthors=Lisco, S.J.|title=Prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications.|journal=International Anesthesiology Clinics|year=2009|volume=47|issue=4|pages=65–88}}</ref>  Of all patient-related risk factors, good evidence supports patients with advanced age, ASA class II or greater, functional dependence, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and congestive heart failure, as those with increased risk for PPC.<ref name="Smetana 2006 581–595">{{cite journal|last=Smetana|first=G.W.|coauthors=Lawrence, V.

Among laboratory tests, a serum albumin level less than 35 g/L is the most powerful predictor and predicts PPC risk to a similar degree as the most important patient-related risk factors.<ref name="Smetana 2006 581–595"/> 

[[Respiratory therapy]] has a place in preventing [[pneumonia]] related to [[atelectasis]], which occurs especially in patients recovering from thoracic and abdominal surgery.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

===Neurologic complications===
[[Stroke]] occurs at a higher rate during the postoperative period.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Hepatorenal complications===
In patients with [[cirrhosis]], the perioperative mortality is predicted by the [[Child-Pugh score]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Epidemiology==
In many countries, statistics are kept by mandatory reporting of perioperative mortality. These may then be used in [[league table]]s that compare the quality of hospitals. Critics of this system point out that perioperative mortality may not reflect poor performance but could be caused by other factors, e.g. a high proportion of acute/unplanned surgery. Most hospitals have regular meetings to discuss surgical complications and perioperative mortality. Specific cases may be investigated more closely if a preventable cause has been identified.

Most perioperative mortality is attributable to [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] from the operation (such as bleeding, [[sepsis]], and failure of vital organs) or pre-existing [[Comorbidity|medical conditions]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Mortality directly related to anesthetic management is less common, and may include such causes as [[pulmonary aspiration]] of gastric contents,<ref name=Engelhart1999>{{Cite journal|author=Engelhart T and Webster NR|title=Pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents in anaesthesia|journal=Br J Anaesth|volume=83|issue=3|pages=453–60|year=1999|pmid=10655918|url=http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/83/3/453.full.pdf}}</ref> [[asphyxia]]tion<ref name=Parker1956>{{Cite journal|author=Parker RB|title=Maternal Death from Aspiration Asphyxia|journal=BMJ|volume=2|issue=4983|pages=16–9|year=1956|pmc=2034767|pmid=13329366|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4983.16|url=}}</ref> and [[anaphylaxis]].<ref name=Dewachter2009>{{Cite journal|author=Dewachter P, Mouton-Faivre C, Emala CW|title=Anaphylaxis and Anesthesia: Controversies and New Insights|journal=Anesthesiology|volume=111|issue=5|pages=1141–50|year=2009|pmid=19858877|doi=10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181bbd443|url=http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/fulltext/2009/11000/anaphylaxis_and_anesthesia__controversies_and_new.31.aspx#}}</ref> These in turn may result from malfunction of [[Instruments used in anesthesiology|anesthesia-related equipment]] or more commonly, [[Human reliability|human error]].

Anaesthesiologists are committed to continuously reducing perioperative mortality and morbidity. In 2010, the principal European anaesthesiology organisations launched [[The Helsinki Declaration for Patient Safety in Anaesthesiology]], a practically-based manifesto for improving anaesthesia care in Europe.
