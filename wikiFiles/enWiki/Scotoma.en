A '''scotoma''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for ''darkness''; plural: ''scotomas'' or ''scotomata'') is an area of partial alteration in the [[field of vision]] consisting of a partially diminished or entirely [[macular degeneration|degenerated]] [[visual acuity]] that is surrounded by a field of normal – or relatively well-preserved – [[Visual perception|vision]].

Every normal [[mammal]]ian eye has a scotoma in its field of vision, usually termed its [[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]].  This is a location with no [[photoreceptor cell]]s, where the [[retina]]l [[ganglion cell]] [[axons]] that comprise the [[optic nerve]] exit the retina. This location is called the [[optic disc]].  When both eyes are open, visual signals that are absent in the blind spot of one eye are provided from the opposite visual cortex for the other eye, even when the other eye is closed{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}. The absence of visual imagery from the blind spot does not intrude into [[consciousness]] with one eye closed, because the corresponding [[visual field]] locations of the optic discs in the two eyes differ{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}.

The presence of the scotoma can be demonstrated subjectively by covering one eye, carefully holding [[Fixation (visual)|fixation]] with the open eye, and placing an object (such as one's thumb) in the [[Human anatomical terms#Anatomical directions|lateral]] and [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] visual field, about 15 degrees from fixation (see the [[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]] article).  The size of the [[monocular]] scotoma is 5×7 degrees of [[visual angle]]. 

Scotoma is also a symptom of retinal damage from exposure to high-powered lasers.

The term ''scotoma'' is also used [[metaphor]]ically in [[psychology]] to refer to an individual's inability to perceive [[personality trait]]s in themselves that are obvious to others.

==Presentation of pathological scotoma==
Symptom-producing, or [[pathology|pathological]], scotomata may be due to a wide range of disease processes, affecting either the [[retina]] (in particular its most sensitive portion, the [[macula]]) or the [[optic nerve]] itself.  A pathological scotoma may involve any part of the [[visual field]] and may be of any shape or size.  A scotoma may include and enlarge the normal blind spot.  Even a small scotoma that happens to affect central or [[macula]]r vision will produce a severe visual [[disability|handicap]], whereas a large scotoma in the more [[Peripheral vision|peripheral]] part of a visual field may go unnoticed by the bearer because of the normal reduced [[optical resolution]] in the peripheral visual field.

==Causes==
Common causes of scotomata include [[demyelinating]] disease such as [[multiple sclerosis]]  ([[retrobulbar neuritis]]), damage to nerve fiber layer in the retina (seen as cotton wool spots) due to hypertension, toxic substances such as [[methyl alcohol]], [[ethambutol]] and [[quinine]], [[nutritional deficiencies]], and [[blood vessel|vascular]] blockages either in the retina or in the optic nerve.  [[Scintillating scotoma]] is a common visual [[Aura (symptom)|aura]] in [[migraine]].<ref>"Possible Roles of Vertebrate Neuroglia in Potassium Dynamics, Spreading depression, and migraine", Gardner-Medwin, ''J. Exp. Biology'' (1981), 95, pages 111-127 (Figure 4).</ref> Less common, but important because they are sometimes reversible or curable by [[surgery]], are scotomata due to [[tumor]]s such as those arising from the [[pituitary gland]], which may compress the optic nerve or interfere with its blood supply.

Rarely, scotomata are [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]]. One important variety of bilateral scotoma may occur when a pituitary [[tumour]] begins to compress the [[optic chiasm]] (as distinct from a single optic nerve) and produces a [[paracentral scotoma|bitemporal paracentral scotoma]], and later, when the tumor enlarges, the scotomas extend out to the periphery to cause the characteristic [[bitemporal hemianopsia]].  This type of visual-field defect tends to be obvious to the person experiencing it but often evades early objective [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], as it is more difficult to detect by cursory clinical examination than the classical or textbook bitemporal peripheral hemianopia and may even elude sophisticated electronic modes of visual-field assessment.

In a pregnant woman, scotomata can present as a symptom of severe [[preeclampsia]], a form of pregnancy-induced [[hypertension]].  Similarly, scotomata may develop as a result of the increased [[intracranial pressure]] that occurs in [[malignant hypertension]].
