== History ==

Marijuana Anonymous (MA) formed in June 1989<ref name="washtimes" /> to address compulsive use of cannabis. Since its inception, the MA fellowship has followed the [[Twelve Traditions]] and suggests practicing the Twelve Steps, both of which originated from [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].<ref>{{cite book|title=A brief cognitive-behavioural intervention for cannabis dependence: Therapists' treatment manual|author=Vaughan Rees, Jan Copeland and Wendy Swift|publisher=University of New South Wales, Australia|year=1998|url=http://notes.med.unsw.edu.au/NDARCWeb.nsf/resources/TR_25/$file/TR.064.pdf}}</ref> Among the founders at the first MA conference in [[Morro Bay]] were delegates from Marijuana Smokers Anonymous ([[Orange County, California]]), Marijuana Addicts Anonymous (the [[San Francisco Bay]] area), and Marijuana Anonymous ([[Los Angeles County]]). Other existing fellowships from [[Seattle]] and [[New York]] (1974), enfolded into MA later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marijuana-anonymous.org/literature/pamphlets/why-marijuana-anonymous|title=Why Marijuana Anonymous?|accessdate=23 August 2012|publisher=Marijuana Anonymous}}</ref>

Marijuana Anonymous set up in London UK in 2000.

== Meetings ==
Meetings are a vital part of the MA program. This is where fellowship members go for support, for literature, and mark and celebrate their abstinence from marijuana. There are regularly scheduled (typically weekly) in-person meetings<ref>{{cite web|title=In-Person Meetings|url=http://www.marijuana-anonymous.org/meetings/in-person|publisher=Marijuana Anonymous World Services|accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref> across the globe, as well as online meetings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Online Meetings|url=http://www.marijuana-anonymous.org/meetings/online-meetings|publisher=Marijuana Anonymous World Services|accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref> Those with a desire to quit marijuana use may also participate in an online discussion forum.<ref>{{cite web|title=Forum|url=http://www.marijuana-anonymous.org/connection-forum|publisher=Marijuana Anonymous World Services|accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref>

Various meeting formats exist. These include, but are not limited to: speaker, participation, book study, candlelight.
