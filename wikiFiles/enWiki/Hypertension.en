'''Hypertension''' ('''HTN''') or '''high blood pressure''', sometimes called '''arterial hypertension''', is a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[Disease|medical condition]] in which the [[blood pressure]] in the [[artery|arteries]] is elevated.<ref name=JNC7/>  This requires the heart to work harder than normal to circulate blood through the blood vessels. Blood pressure is summarised by two measurements, [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] and [[diastolic]], which depend on whether the heart muscle is contracting (systole) or relaxed between beats (diastole) and equate to a maximum and minimum pressure, respectively. Normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100-140mmHg systolic (top reading) and 60-90mmHg diastolic (bottom reading). High blood pressure is said to be present if it is persistently at or above 140/90&nbsp;mmHg.

Hypertension is classified as either [[Essential hypertension|primary (essential) hypertension]] or [[secondary hypertension]]; about 90–95% of cases are categorized as "primary hypertension" which means high blood pressure with no obvious underlying medical cause.<ref name="pmid10645931">{{cite journal |author=Carretero OA, Oparil S |title=Essential hypertension. Part I: definition and etiology |journal=Circulation |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=329–35 |year=2000 |month=January |pmid=10645931 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/101/3/329.long |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.101.3.329}}</ref> The remaining 5–10% of cases (secondary hypertension) are caused by other conditions that affect the kidneys, arteries, heart or endocrine system.

Hypertension is a major [[risk factor]] for [[stroke]], [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attacks), [[heart failure]], [[aneurysm]]s of the arteries (e.g. [[aortic aneurysm]]), [[peripheral arterial disease]] and is a cause of [[chronic kidney disease]]. Even moderate elevation of arterial blood pressure is associated with a shortened [[life expectancy]]. Dietary and lifestyle changes can improve blood pressure control and decrease the risk of associated health complications, although drug treatment is often necessary in people for whom lifestyle changes prove ineffective or insufficient.

==Signs and symptoms==
Hypertension is rarely accompanied by any symptoms, and its identification is usually through [[Screening (medicine)|screening]], or when seeking healthcare for an unrelated problem. A proportion of people with high blood pressure report [[headache]]s (particularly at the [[Occiput|back of the head]] and in the morning), as well as [[lightheadedness]], [[vertigo]], [[tinnitus]] (buzzing or hissing in the ears), altered vision or [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting episodes]].<ref name=Fisher2005>{{cite book |author=Fisher ND, Williams GH |editor=Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, ''et al.'' |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|edition=16th |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-07-139140-1 |pages=1463–81 |chapter=Hypertensive vascular disease}}</ref> These symptoms however are more likely to be related to associated [[anxiety]] than the high blood pressure itself.<ref name=Stress2012/>

On [[physical examination]], hypertension may be suspected on the basis of the presence of [[hypertensive retinopathy]] detected by examination of the [[optic fundus]] found in the back of the eye using [[ophthalmoscopy]].<ref name=Wong2007>{{cite journal |author=Wong T, Mitchell P |title=The eye in hypertension |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9559 |pages=425–35 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17276782 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60198-6}}</ref> Classically, the severity of the hypertensive retinopathy changes is graded from grade I–IV, although the milder types may be difficult to distinguish from each other.<ref name=Wong2007/> Ophthalmoscopy findings may also give some indication as to how long a person has been hypertensive.<ref name=Fisher2005/>

===Secondary hypertension===
{{Main|Secondary hypertension}}
Some additional signs and symptoms may suggest [[secondary hypertension]], i.e. hypertension due to an identifiable cause such as [[kidney diseases]] or [[endocrine diseases]]. For example, truncal obesity, [[glucose intolerance]], [[moon facies]], a "buffalo hump" and purple [[striae]] suggest [[Cushing's syndrome]].<ref name=ABC>{{cite book |author=O'Brien, Eoin; Beevers, D. G.; Lip, Gregory Y. H. |title=ABC of hypertension |publisher=BMJ Books |location=London |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4051-3061-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> [[Thyroid disease]] and [[acromegaly]] can also cause hypertension and have characteristic symptoms and signs.<ref name="ABC" /> An abdominal [[bruit]] may be an indicator of [[renal artery stenosis]] (a narrowing of the arteries supplying the kidneys), while decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities and/or delayed or absent [[femoral artery|femoral arterial pulses]] may indicate [[aortic coarctation]] (a narrowing of the aorta shortly after it leaves the heart). [[Labile]] or paroxysmal hypertension accompanied by headache, palpitations, pallor, and perspiration should prompt suspicions of [[pheochromocytoma]].<ref name="ABC" /> A proportion of resistant hypertension appears to be the result of chronic high activity of the [[autonomic nervous system]]; this concept is known as "neurogenic hypertension".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zubcevic J, Waki H, Raizada MK, Paton JF |title=Autonomic-immune-vascular interaction: an emerging concept for neurogenic hypertension |journal=Hypertension |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=1026–33 |year=2011 |month=June |pmid=21536990 |pmc=3105900 |doi=10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.169748 |url=http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/57/6/1026.long}}</ref>

===Hypertensive crisis===
{{main|Hypertensive emergency}}
Severely elevated blood pressure (equal to or greater than a systolic 180 or diastolic of 110 — sometime termed malignant or accelerated hypertension) is referred to as a "hypertensive crisis", as blood pressures above these levels are known to confer a high risk of complications. People with blood pressures in this range may have no symptoms, but are more likely to report headaches (22% of cases)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Papadopoulos DP, Mourouzis I, Thomopoulos C, Makris T, Papademetriou V |title=Hypertension crisis |journal=Blood Press. |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=328–36 |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=20504242 |doi=10.3109/08037051.2010.488052 |url=}}</ref> and dizziness than the general population.<ref name=Fisher2005/> Other symptoms accompanying a hypertensive crisis may include visual deterioration or breathlessness due to heart failure or a general feeling of [[malaise]] due to renal failure.<ref name="ABC" /> Most people with a hypertensive crisis are known to have elevated blood pressure, but additional triggers may have led to a sudden rise.<ref name=Marik2007>{{cite journal |author=Marik PE, Varon J |title=Hypertensive crises: challenges and management |journal=Chest |volume=131 |issue=6 |pages=1949–62 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17565029 |doi=10.1378/chest.06-2490 |url=http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/131/6/1949.long}}</ref> 

A "hypertensive emergency", previously "malignant hypertension", is diagnosed when there is evidence of direct damage to one or more organs as a result of the severely elevated blood pressure. This may include [[hypertensive encephalopathy]], caused by brain swelling and dysfunction, and characterized by headaches and an [[altered level of consciousness]] (confusion or drowsiness). Retinal [[papilloedema]] and/or fundal [[hemorrhages]] and [[exudates]] are another sign of target organ damage. [[Chest pain]] may indicate [[acute coronary syndrome|heart muscle damage]] (which may progress to [[myocardial infarction]]) or sometimes [[aortic dissection]], the tearing of the inner wall of the [[aorta]]. [[Dyspnea|Breathlessness]], cough, and the expectoration of blood-stained sputum are characteristic signs of [[pulmonary edema]], the swelling of lung tissue due to [[left ventricular failure]] an inability of the [[left ventricle]] of the heart to adequately pump blood from the lungs into the arterial system.<ref name=Marik2007/> [[Acute kidney injury|Rapid deterioration of kidney function]] (acute kidney injury) and [[microangiopathic hemolytic anemia]] (destruction of blood cells) may also occur.<ref name=Marik2007/> In these situations, rapid reduction of the blood pressure is mandated to stop ongoing organ damage.<ref name=Marik2007/> In contrast there is no evidence that blood pressure needs to be lowered rapidly in hypertensive urgencies where there is no evidence of target organ damage and over aggressive reduction of blood pressure is not without risks.<ref name="ABC" /> Use of oral medications to lower the BP gradually over 24 to 48 h is advocated in hypertensive urgencies.<ref name=Marik2007/>

===Pregnancy===
Hypertension occurs in approximately 8–10% of pregnancies.<ref name="ABC" /> Most women with hypertension in pregnancy have pre-existing primary hypertension, but high blood pressure in pregnancy may be the first sign of [[pre-eclampsia]], a serious condition of the second half of pregnancy and [[puerperium]].<ref name="ABC" /> Pre-eclampsia is characterised by increased blood pressure and the presence of [[proteinuria|protein in the urine]].<ref name="ABC" /> It occurs in about 5% of pregnancies and is responsible for approximately 16% of all [[maternal death]]s globally.<ref name="ABC" /> Pre-eclampsia also doubles the risk of [[perinatal mortality]].<ref name="ABC" /> Usually there are no symptoms in pre-eclampsia and it is detected by routine screening. When symptoms of pre-eclampsia occur the most common are headache, visual disturbance (often "flashing lights"), vomiting, [[epigastric]] pain, and [[edema]]. Pre-eclampsia can occasionally progress to a life-threatening condition called [[eclampsia]], which is a [[hypertensive emergency]] and has several serious complications including [[blindness|vision loss]], [[cerebral edema]], [[tonic-clonic seizures|seizures]] or [[convulsions]], [[renal failure]], [[pulmonary edema]], and [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (a blood clotting disorder).<ref name="ABC" /><ref name="urlHypertension and Pregnancy: eMedicine Obstetrics and Gynecology">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/261435-overview |title=Hypertension and Pregnancy |author=Gibson, Paul |coauthors= |date=July 30, 2009 |work=eMedicine Obstetrics and Gynecology |publisher=Medscape |pages= |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>

===Primary hypertension===
{{Main|Essential hypertension}}
Primary (essential) hypertension is the most common form of hypertension, accounting for 90–95% of all cases of hypertension.<ref name="pmid10645931"/> In almost all contemporary societies, blood pressure rises with [[aging]] and the risk of becoming hypertensive in later life is considerable.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vasan|first=RS|coauthors=Beiser, A, Seshadri, S, Larson, MG, Kannel, WB, D'Agostino, RB, Levy, D|title=Residual lifetime risk for developing hypertension in middle-aged women and men: The Framingham Heart Study|journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association|date=2002-02-27|volume=287|issue=8|pages=1003–10|pmid=11866648|doi=10.1001/jama.287.8.1003}}</ref> Hypertension results from a complex interaction of genes and environmental factors.

Secondary hypertension results from an identifiable cause. Renal disease is the most common secondary cause of hypertension.<ref name="ABC" /> Hypertension can also be caused by endocrine conditions, such as [[Cushing's syndrome]], [[hyperthyroidism]], [[hypothyroidism]], [[acromegaly]], [[Conn's syndrome]] or [[hyperaldosteronism]], [[hyperparathyroidism]] and [[pheochromocytoma]].<ref name="ABC" /><ref>Dluhy RG, Williams GH.

Many mechanisms have been proposed to account for the rise in peripheral resistance in hypertension.

Hypertension is diagnosed on the basis of a persistently high blood pressure. Traditionally,<ref name="NICE127 full"/> this requires three separate sphygmomanometer measurements at one monthly intervals.<ref>{{cite book| author=North of England Hypertension Guideline Development Group |chapter=Frequency of measurements |page=53| title=Essential hypertension (NICE CG18) |publisher=[[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] |date=1 August 2004 |url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/index.jsp?action=download&o=48384 |accessdate=2011-12-22}}</ref> Initial assessment of the hypertensive people should include a complete [[Medical history|history]] and [[physical examination]]. With the availability of 24-hour [[ambulatory blood pressure]] monitors and [[bloodpressure#Home monitoring|home blood pressure]] machines, the importance of not wrongly diagnosing those who have [[white coat hypertension]] has led to a change in protocols. In the United Kingdom, current best practice is to follow up a single raised clinic reading with ambulatory measurement, or less ideally with home blood pressure monitoring over the course of 7 days.<ref name="NICE127 full">{{cite book |author=National Clinical Guideline Centre |title=Hypertension (NICE CG 127) |publisher=[[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] |chapter=7 Diagnosis of Hypertension, 7.5 Link from evidence to recommendations |page=102 |date=August 2011|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13561/56007/56007.pdf |accessdate=2011-12-22}}</ref> [[Pseudohypertension in the elderly]] or noncompressibility artery syndrome may also require consideration.

Once the diagnosis of hypertension has been made, physicians will attempt to identify the underlying cause based on risk factors and other symptoms, if present. [[Secondary hypertension]] is more common in preadolescent children, with most cases caused by [[renal disease]]. Primary or [[essential hypertension]] is more common in adolescents and has multiple risk factors, including obesity and a family history of hypertension.<ref name="pmid16719248">{{cite journal | author = Luma GB, Spiotta RT | title = Hypertension in children and adolescents | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 73 | issue = 9 | pages = 1558–68 | month = may | year = 2006 | pmid = 16719248}}</ref> Laboratory tests can also be performed to identify possible causes of secondary hypertension, and to determine whether hypertension has caused damage to the [[Human heart|heart]], [[Human eyes|eyes]], and [[kidney]]s. Additional tests for [[diabetes]] and [[high cholesterol]] levels are usually performed because these conditions are additional risk factors for the development of [[heart disease]] and may require treatment.<ref name="pmid10645931"/>

Serum [[creatinine]] is measured to assess for the presence of kidney disease, which can be either the cause or the result of hypertension. Serum creatinine alone may overestimate [[glomerular filtration rate]] and recent guidelines advocate the use of predictive equations such as the [[Modification of Diet in Renal Disease]] (MDRD) formula to estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).<ref name = JNC7 /> eGFR can also provides a baseline measurement of kidney function that can be used to monitor for side effects of certain antihypertensive drugs on kidney function. Additionally, testing of urine samples for [[proteinuria|protein]] is used as a secondary indicator of kidney disease. [[Electrocardiogram]] (EKG/ECG) testing is done to check for evidence that the heart is under strain from high blood pressure. It may also show whether there is thickening of the heart muscle ([[left ventricular hypertrophy]]) or whether the heart has experienced a prior minor disturbance such as a silent heart attack. A [[chest X-ray]] or an [[echocardiogram]] may also be performed to look for signs of heart enlargement or damage to the heart.<ref name="ABC" />

In people aged 18 years or older hypertension  is defined as a systolic and/or a diastolic blood pressure measurement consistently higher than an accepted normal value (currently 139&nbsp;mmHg systolic, 89&nbsp;mmHg diastolic: see table —Classification (JNC7)). Lower thresholds are used (135&nbsp;mmHg systolic or 85&nbsp;mmHg diastolic) if measurements are derived from 24-hour ambulatory or home monitoring.<ref name="NICE127 full">{{cite book |author=National Clinical Guidance Centre |title=Hypertension (NICE CG 127) |publisher=[[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] |chapter=7 Diagnosis of Hypertension, 7.5 Link from evidence to recommendations |page=102 |date=August 2011|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13561/56007/56007.pdf |accessdate=2011-12-22}}</ref> Recent international hypertension guidelines have also created categories below the hypertensive range to indicate a continuum of risk with higher blood pressures in the normal range. JNC7 (2003)<ref name="JNC7"/> uses the term prehypertension for blood pressure in the range 120-139&nbsp;mmHg systolic and/or 80-89&nbsp;mmHg diastolic, while ESH-ESC Guidelines (2007)<ref name=ESH-ESC>{{cite journal |author=Mancia G |title=2007 ESH-ESC Practice Guidelines for the Management of Arterial Hypertension: ESH-ESC Task Force on the Management of Arterial Hypertension |journal=J.

Hypertension is classified as "resistant" if [[Pharmaceutical drug|medications]] do not reduce blood pressure to normal levels.<ref name="JNC7"/>

===Children===
Hypertension in [[neonates]] is rare, occurring in around 0.2 to 3% of neonates, and blood pressure is not measured routinely in the healthy newborn.<ref name=Dionne>{{cite journal |author=Dionne JM, Abitbol CL, Flynn JT|title=Hypertension in infancy: diagnosis, management and outcome |journal=Pediatr.

A variety of factors, such as [[gestational age]], postconceptional age and [[birth weight]]needs to be taken into account when deciding if a blood pressure is normal in a neonate.<ref name=Dionne />

Hypertension occurs quite commonly in children and adolescents (2-9% depending on age, sex and ethnicity)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Din-Dzietham R, Liu Y, Bielo MV, Shamsa F |title=High blood pressure trends in children and adolescents in national surveys, 1963 to 2002 |journal=Circulation |volume=116 |issue=13 |pages=1488–96 |year=2007 |month=September|pmid=17846287 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.683243 |url=}}</ref> and is associated with long term risks of ill-health.<ref name=fourth>{{cite journal |author= |title=The fourth report on the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure in children and adolescents |journal=Pediatrics |volume=114 |issue=2 Suppl 4th Report |pages=555–76|year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15286277 |doi= 10.1542/peds.114.2.S2.555|url= |author1= National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents}}</ref>
It is now recommended that children over the age of 3 have their blood pressure checked whenever they attend for routine medical care or checks, but high blood pressure must be confirmed on repeated visits before characterizing a child as having hypertension.<ref name = fourth /> Blood pressure rises with age in childhood and, in children, hypertension is defined as an average systolic or diastolic blood pressure on three or more occasions equal or higher than the 95th percentile appropriate for the sex, age and height of the child.  Prehypertension in children is defined as average systolic or diastolic blood pressure that is greater than or equal to the 90th percentile, but less than the 95th percentile.<ref name=fourth />
In adolescents, it has been proposed that hypertension and pre-hypertension are diagnosed and classified using the same criteria as in adults.<ref name=fourth />

==Prevention==
Much of the disease burden of high blood pressure is experienced by people who are not labelled as hypertensive.<ref name="BHSIV"/> Consequently, population strategies are required to reduce the consequences of high blood pressure and reduce the need for antihypertensive drug therapy. Lifestyle changes are recommended to lower blood pressure, before starting  drug therapy. The 2004 British Hypertension Society guidelines<ref name="BHSIV"/> proposed the following lifestyle changes consistent with those outlined by the US National High BP Education Program in 2002<ref>{{cite journal | author = Whelton PK | year = 2002 | title = Primary prevention of hypertension.

* maintain normal body weight for adults (e.g. body mass index 20–25&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>)
* reduce dietary sodium intake to <100&nbsp;mmol/ day (<6 g of sodium chloride or <2.4 g of sodium per day)
* engage in regular aerobic physical activity such as brisk walking (≥30 min per day, most days of the week)
* limit alcohol consumption to no more than 3 units/day in men and no more than 2 units/day in women
* consume a diet rich in fruit and vegetables (e.g. at least five portions per day);
Effective lifestyle modification may lower blood pressure as much an individual antihypertensive drug. Combinations of two or more lifestyle modifications can achieve even better results.<ref name="BHSIV"/>

Several classes of medications, collectively referred to as [[antihypertensive drug]]s, are currently available for treating hypertension.

Modern understanding of the cardiovascular system began with the work of physician [[William Harvey]] (1578–1657), who  described the circulation of blood in his book "''De motu cordis''".
