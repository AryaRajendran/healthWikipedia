'''Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)''' is a technique that temporarily takes over the function of the [[heart]] and [[lung]]s during [[surgery]], maintaining the circulation of blood and the oxygen content of the body.  The CPB pump itself is often referred to as a '''heart–lung machine''' or "the pump".  Cardiopulmonary bypass pumps are operated by [[perfusionist]]s.  CPB is a form of [[extracorporeal]] circulation.

==Uses of cardiopulmonary bypass==
Cardiopulmonary bypass is commonly used in [[heart surgery]] because of the difficulty of operating on the beating heart.  Operations requiring the opening of the chambers of the heart require the use of CPB to support the [[Circulatory system|circulation]] during that period. The machine nourishes the blood cells and allows them to continue cellular respiration even through surgery.

CPB can be used for the induction of total body [[therapeutic hypothermia|hypothermia]], a state in which the body can be maintained for up to 45 minutes without [[perfusion]] (blood flow).  If blood flow is stopped at normal [[body temperature]], permanent [[brain damage]] normally occurs in three to four minutes — death may follow shortly afterward. Similarly, CPB can be used to rewarm individuals suffering from [[hypothermia]].<ref>{{Cite journal  |last1 = McCullough | first1 = L. | last2 = Arora | first2 = S. | title = Diagnosis and treatment of hypothermia. | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 70 | issue = 12 | pages = 2325–32 | month = Dec | year = 2004 | doi =  | pmid = 15617296 }}</ref>

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ([[ECMO]]) is a simplified form of CPB sometimes used as [[life-support]] for newborns with serious [[birth defects]], or to [[oxygenate]] and maintain recipients for [[organ transplantation]] until new organs can be found.

CPB mechanically circulates and oxygenates blood for the body while bypassing the heart and lungs. It uses a heart–lung machine to maintain perfusion to other body organs and tissues while the surgeon works in a bloodless surgical field. The surgeon places a [[cannula]] in right atrium, vena cava, or femoral vein to withdraw blood from the body. The cannula is connected to tubing filled with isotonic crystalloid solution. Venous blood that is removed from the body by the cannula is filtered, cooled or warmed, oxygenated, and then returned to the body. The cannula used to return oxygenated blood is usually inserted in the ascending aorta, but it may be inserted in the femoral artery. The patient is administered [[heparin]] to prevent clotting, and [[protamine sulfate]] is given after to reverse effects of heparin. During the procedure, hypothermia is maintained; body temperature is usually kept at 28ºC to 32ºC (82.4–89.6ºF). The blood is cooled during CPB and returned to the body. The cooled blood slows the body’s basal metabolic rate, decreasing its demand for oxygen. Cooled blood usually has a higher viscosity, but the crystalloid solution used to prime the bypass tubing dilutes the blood.

==History==
[[File:1955 heart lung machine.jpg|thumb|right|A heart lung machine dating from 1958]]
A Soviet scientist [[Sergei Brukhonenko]] developed the first heart-lung machine for total body perfusion in 1926. [[Clarence Dennis|Dr. Clarence Dennis]] led the team that conducted the first known operation involving open cardiotomy with temporary mechanical takeover of both heart and lung functions on April 5, 1951 at the University of Minnesota Hospital.  The patient did not survive due to an unexpected complex congenital heart defect.  This followed four years of laboratory experimentation with dogs with a unit called the ''Iron Heart''. A team of scientists at Birmingham University (including Eric Charles, a Chemical Engineer) were among the pioneers of this technology. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Dennis C |title=Development of a Pump-oxygenator to Replace the Heart and Lungs: An Apparatus Applicable to Human Patients and Application to One Case |journal=Ann.

Ellis] February 1951 [[Popular Science]]</ref> Another member of the team was Dr. [[Russell M. Nelson]], who performed the first open heart surgery in [[Utah]].

The first successful mechanical support of left ventricular function was performed in July 3, 1952 by [[Forest Dewey Dodrill]] using a machine, the [[Dodrill-GMR]] co-developed with General Motors. The machine was later used to support right ventricular function.<ref>{{cite book|last=Norton|first=Jeffrey|title=Surgery: Basic science and clinical evidence|year=2008|publisher=springer|location=NY|isbn=978-0-387-30800-5|pages=1473}}</ref>

The first successful open heart procedure on a human utilizing the heart lung machine was performed by [[John Heysham Gibbon|John Gibbon]] on May 6, 1953 at [[Thomas Jefferson University]] Hospital in [[Philadelphia]].  He repaired an [[atrial septal defect]] in an 18-year-old woman.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cohn LH |title=Fifty years of open-heart surgery |journal=Circulation |volume=107 |issue=17 |pages=2168–70 |year=2003 |month=May |pmid=12732590 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000071746.50876.E2 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12732590}}</ref>

The oxygenator was first conceptualized in the 17th century by [[Robert Hooke]] and developed into practical extracorporeal oxygenators by French and German experimental physiologists in the 19th century. Bubble oxygenators have no intervening barrier between blood and oxygen, these are called 'direct contact' oxygenators. Membrane oxygenators introduce a gas-permeable membrane between blood and oxygen that decreases the blood trauma of direct-contact oxygenators. Much work since the 1960s focused on overcoming the gas exchange handicap of the membrane barrier, leading to the development of high-performance microporous hollow-fibre oxygenators that eventually replaced direct-contact oxygenators in cardiac theatres.<ref name="Lim 2006">{{cite journal |author=Lim M |title=The history of extracorporeal oxygenators |journal=Anaesthesia |volume=61 |issue=10 |pages=984–95 |year=2006 |pmid=16978315 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.2006.04781.x}}</ref>

==Components of cardiopulmonary bypass==
Cardiopulmonary bypass consists of two main functional units, the [[pump]] and the [[oxygenator]] which remove oxygen-deprived blood from a patient's body and replace it with oxygen-rich blood through a series of tubes (hoses).

===Tubing===
The components of the CPB circuit are interconnected by a series of tubes made of [[silicone rubber]] or [[PVC]].

===Pumps===
====Roller pump====
The pump console usually comprises several rotating motor-driven  pumps that [[peristalsis|peristaltically]] "massage" tubing.  This action gently propels the blood through the tubing. This is commonly referred to as a roller pump, or [[peristaltic pump]].

====Centrifugal pump====
Many CPB circuits now employ a [[centrifugal pump]] for the maintenance and control of blood flow during CPB.  By altering the speed of revolution (RPM) of the pump head, blood flow is produced by centrifugal force.  This type of pumping action is considered to be superior to the action of the roller pump by many because it is thought to produce less blood damage ([[Hemolysis]], etc.).

===Oxygenator===
The [[oxygenator]] is designed to transfer [[oxygen]] to infused [[blood]] and remove [[carbon dioxide]] from the [[venous blood]].  Cardiac surgery was made possible by CPB using [[bubble oxygenator]]s, but [[membrane oxygenator]]s have supplanted bubble oxygenators since the 1980s.

Another type of oxygenator gaining favour recently is the [[heparin-coated blood oxygenator]] which is believed to produce less systemic inflammation and decrease the propensity for blood to clot in the CPB circuit.

===Cannulae===
Multiple [[cannula|cannulae]] are sewn into the patient's body in a variety of locations, depending on the type of surgery.  A venous cannula removes oxygen deprived blood from a patient's body.  An arterial cannula infuses oxygen-rich blood into the arterial system.  A [[cardioplegia]] cannula delivers a cardioplegia solution to cause the heart to stop beating.

===Cardioplegia===
{{main|Cardioplegia}}
A CPB circuit consists of a systemic circuit for oxygenating blood and reinfusing blood into a patient's body (bypassing the heart); and a separate circuit for infusing a solution into the heart itself to produce [[cardioplegia]] (i.e. to stop the heart from beating), and to provide [[myocardial protection]] (i.e. to prevent death of heart tissue).

==Operation==
A CPB circuit must be primed with fluid and all air expunged before connection to the patient.  The circuit is primed with a [[intravenous therapy|crystalloid]] solution and sometimes blood products are also added. The patient must be fully anticoagulated with an [[anticoagulant]] such as [[heparin]] to prevent massive clotting of blood in the circuit.

==Complications==
CPB is not benign and there are a number of associated problems:

*[[Postperfusion syndrome]] (also known as Pumphead)
*[[Hemolysis]]
*[[Capillary leak syndrome]]
*[[Clot|Clotting]] of blood in the circuit – can block the circuit (particularly the oxygenator) or send a clot into the patient.
*[[Air embolism]]
*Leakage – a patient can rapidly [[exsanguinate]] (lose blood perfusion of tissues) if a line becomes disconnected.
* 1.5% of patients that undergo CPB are at risk of developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

As a consequence, CPB is only used during the several hours a cardiac surgery may take. Most oxygenators come with a manufacturer's recommendation that they are only used for a maximum of 6 hours, although they are sometimes used for up to 10 hours, with care being taken to ensure they do not clot off and stop working. For longer periods than this, an ECMO (extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation) or VAD (ventricular assist device) circuit is used, which can be in operation for up to 31 days – such as in this Taiwanese case, for 16 days, after which the patient received a heart transplant.<ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news126460484.html Man survives 16 days without a heart] united Press International. April 3, 2008.</ref>

CPB may contribute to immediate cognitive decline.  The heart-lung blood circulation system and the connection surgery itself release a variety of debris into the bloodstream, including bits of blood cells, tubing, and plaque.  For example, when surgeons clamp and connect the aorta to tubing, resulting emboli may block blood flow and cause mini strokes.  Other heart surgery factors related to mental damage may be events of hypoxia, high or low body temperature, abnormal blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, and fever after surgery.<ref>Stutz, Bruce [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=pumphead-heart-lung-machine "Pumphead: Does the heart-lung machine have a dark side?"] ''Scientific American'', January 9 2009.</ref>
