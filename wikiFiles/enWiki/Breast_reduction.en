'''Reduction mammoplasty''' (also '''breast reduction''' and '''reduction mammaplasty''') is the cosmetic surgical procedure for reducing the size of large breasts. In a breast reduction surgery for re-establishing a functional [[Cleavage (breasts)|bust]] that is proportionate to the woman's body, the critical corrective consideration is the [[Histology|tissue viability]] of the [[Areola|nipple-areola complex]] (NAC), to ensure the functional sensitivity and [[lactation]]al capability of the breasts. The indications for breast reduction surgery are three-fold — physical, [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], and psychological — the restoration of the bust, of the woman's [[self-image]], and of her [[mental health]].<ref>Anastasatos JM. Medial Pedicle and Mastopexy Breast Reduction (2010) emedicine.medscape.com</ref> In corrective practice, the surgical techniques and praxis for reduction mammoplasty also are applied to [[mastopexy]] (breast lift).<ref>De la Torre, JI.

==Patient==
;Presentation
The woman afflicted with '''macromastia''' presents heavy, enlarged breasts (>500 gm per breast per the '''Shnur Scale''') that sag and cause her chronic pains to the head, neck, shoulders, and back; an oversized [[Cleavage (breasts)|bust]] also causes her secondary health problems, such as poor [[Circulatory system|blood circulation]], impaired [[breathing]] (inability to fill the lungs with air); chafing of the skin of the chest and the lower breast (inframammary intertrigo); brassière-strap indentations to the shoulders; and the improper fit of clothes.

In the woman afflicted with '''gigantomastia''' (>1,000 gm increase per breast), the average breast-volume reduction diminished her oversized bust by three (3) brassière cup-sizes.<ref>Heine N, Eisenmann–Klein M, Prantl L.

;Medical history
The medical history records the woman's age, the number of children she has borne, her [[Breastfeeding|breast-feeding]] practices, plans for pregnancy and nursing of the infant, medication allergies, and tendency to bleeding. Additional to the personal medical information, are her history of [[tobacco smoking]] and concomitant diseases, breast-surgery and breast-disease histories, family history of [[breast cancer]], and complaints of neck, back, shoulder pain, breast sensitivity, rashes, infection, and upper extremity numbness.

The physical examination records and establishes the accurate measures of the woman's [[body mass index]], vital signs, the mass of each breast, the degree of inframammary intertrigo present, the degree of [[Ptosis (breasts)|breast ptosis]], the degree of enlargement of each breast, lesions to the skin envelope, the degree of sensation in the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and discharges from the nipple. Also noted are the secondary effects of the enlarged breasts, such as shoulder-notching by the brassière strap from the breast weight, [[kyphosis]] (excessive, backwards curvature of the [[Thoracic vertebrae|thoracic region]] of the [[spinal column]]), skin irritation, and skin rash affecting the breast crease (IMF).<ref name="EspinosadelosMonteros">Espinosa-de-los-Monteros A, De la Torre JE.

[[File:Stades de affaissement.png|thumb|right|300px|Reduction mammoplasty: the degree of breast ptosis, the falling forward (prolapsation) of the [[Mammary gland|breast]], determines the applicable surgery technique.]]
;Etiology
A woman develops large breasts usually during [[thelarche]] (the pubertal breast-development stage), but large breasts can also develop postpartum, after gaining weight, at [[menopause]], and at any age. Whereas '''macromastia''' usually develops in consequence to the [[hypertrophy]] (overdevelopment) of [[Adipose tissue|adipose fat]], rather than to milk-gland hypertrophy. Moreover, many women are [[Genetics|genetically]] predisposed to developing large breasts, the size and weight of which often are increased either by [[pregnancy]] or by weight gain, or by both conditions; there also exist [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] (physician-caused) conditions such as post–[[mastectomy]] and post–[[lumpectomy]] asymmetry. Nonetheless, it is statistically rare for a young woman to experience virginal mammary hypertrophy that results in massive, oversized breasts, and recurrent [[Hypertrophy of breast|breast hypertrophy]].

The abnormal enlargement of the breast tissues to a volume in excess of the normal bust-to-body proportions can be caused either by the overdevelopment of the [[Lactiferous duct|milk glands]] or of the [[adipose tissue]], or by a combination of both occurrences of hypertrophy. The resultant breast-volume increases can range from the '''mild''' (>300 gm) to the '''moderate''' (ca. 300–800 gm) to the '''severe''' (<800 gm). Macromastia can be manifested either as a unilateral condition or as a bilateral condition (single-breasted enlargement or double-breasted enlargement) that can occur in combination with sagging, [[Ptosis (breasts)|breast ptosis]] that is determined by the degree to which the nipple has descended below the inframammary fold (IMF).<ref name="Grippaudo">Grippaudo FR, Kennedy DC, Tiwari P, Talavera F, Shenaq SM, Slenkovich NG. Liposuction Only Breast Reduction. (7 July 2009) eMedicine.com</ref>

;Therapeutic approaches
;Medical
Breast hypertrophy (macromastia and gigantomastia) does not respond to medical therapy; yet a weight-reduction regimen for the over-weight woman can alleviate some of the excessive size and volume of her abnormally enlarged breasts.<ref>Sadove R. New Observations in Liposuction-only Breast Reduction. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. 9 March 2005.</ref> Physical therapy provides some relief for sufferers of neck, back, or shoulder pain. Skin care will diminish breast crease inflammation and lessen the symptoms caused by moisture, such as irritation, chafing, infection, and bleeding.

;Surgical
Reduction mammoplasty, surgery or lipectomy, is the technically reliable method for diminishing the size and volume of the enlarged breast. The traditional, surgical techniques for breast reduction remodel the breast mound using a skin and glandular (breast tissue) pedicle (inferior, superior, central), and then trim and re-drape the skin envelope into a new breast of natural size, shape, and contour; yet it produces long surgical scars upon the breast hemisphere. In response, L. Benelli, in 1990, presented the '''round block mammoplasty''', a minimal-scar '''periareolar incision''' technique that produces only a periareolar scar — around the nipple-areola complex (NAC), where the dark-to-light skin-color transition hides the surgical scar.<ref>Benelli L. A New Periareolar Mammaplasty: The "round block" Technique. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. Spring 1990;14(2):93–100.</ref>

==Surgical anatomy of the breast==
;The procedure
A '''reduction mammoplasty''' to re-size enlarged breasts and to correct [[Ptosis (breasts)|breast ptosis]] resects (cuts and removes) excess tissues ([[Mammary gland|glandular]], [[adipose]], [[skin]]), overstretched [[Cooper's ligaments|suspensory ligaments]], and transposes the nipple-areola complex (NAC) higher upon the breast hemisphere. At [[puberty]], the breast grows in consequence to the influences of the [[hormone]]s [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]]; as a [[mammary gland]] the breast is composed of lobules of glandular tissue, each of which is drained by a [[lactiferous duct]] that empties to the nipple. Most of the volume (ca. 90%) and rounded contour of the breasts are conferred by the adipose fat interspersed amongst the lobules — except during [[pregnancy]] and [[lactation]], when [[Human breast milk|breast milk]] constitutes most of the breast volume.<ref name="Grippaudo" />

;Composition
Surgically, the breast is an [[Apocrine|apocrine gland]] overlaying the chest — attached at the nipple and suspended with ligaments from the chest — which is integral to the skin, the [[Integumentary system|body integument]] of the woman. The dimensions and weight of the breasts vary with her age and habitus (body build and physical constitution); hence small-to-medium-sized breasts weigh approximately 500 gm, or less, and large breasts weigh approximately 750–1,000 gm.<ref>Pamplona DC, de Abreu Alvim C. Breast Reconstruction with Expanders and Implants: a Numerical Analysis. Artiﬁcial Organs 8 (2004), pp. 353–356.</ref><ref>Grassley JS. Breast Reduction Surgery: What every Woman Needs to Know. Lifelines 6 (2002), pp. 244–249.</ref><ref>Azar FS. A Deformable Finite Element Model of the Breast for Predicting Mechanical Deformations under External Perturbations. (Doctoral thesis) Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Penn., USA, 2001.</ref> Anatomically, the [[Superficial anatomy|breast topography]] and the hemispheric locale of the nipple-areola complex (NAC) are particular to each woman; thus, the desirable, average measurements are a 21–23&nbsp;cm sternal distance (nipple to sternum-bone notch), and a 5–7&nbsp;cm inferior-limb distance (NAC to IMF).

;Blood supply and innervation
The [[arterial blood]] supply of the breast has medial and lateral vascular components; it is supplied with blood by the [[Internal thoracic artery|internal mammary artery]] (from the medial aspect), the lateral thoracic artery (from the lateral aspect), and the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th [[Intercostal arteries|intercostal perforating arteries]]. Drainage of [[venous blood]] from the breast is by the superficial vein system under the [[dermis]], and by the deep vein system parallel to the artery system. The primary [[Lymphatic system|lymph]] drainage system is the retromammary lymph plexus in the [[pectoral fascia]]. Sensation in the breast is established by the [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nervous system innervation]] of the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of the 4th, 5th, and 6th intercostal [[nerve]]s, and [[thoracic spinal nerve 4]] ('''T4 nerve''') innervates and supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.<ref name="Tortora, Gerard J.">Introduction to the Human Body, Fifth Edition.

;Mechanical structures of the breast
In realizing the breast-reduction corrections, the plastic surgeon takes [[Human anatomy|anatomic]] and [[Histology|histologic]] account of the [[Biomechanics|biomechanical]], load-bearing properties of the glandular, adipose, and skin tissues that compose and support the breast; among the properties of the soft tissues of the breast is near-incompressibility ('''Poisson's ratio of ∼0.5''').

# '''Rib cage.''' The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th ribs of the thoracic cage are the structural supports for the mammary glands.
# '''Chest muscles.''' The breasts overlay the [[pectoralis major muscle]], the [[pectoralis minor muscle]], and the intercostal muscles (between the ribs), and can extend to and cover a portion of the (front) [[serratus magnus|anterior serratus muscle]] (attached to the ribs, the rib muscles, and the shoulder blade), and to the [[Rectus abdominis|rectus abdominis muscle]] (a long, ﬂat muscle extending up the torso, from pubic bone to rib cage). The body posture of the woman exerts physical stresses upon the pectoralis major muscles and the pectoralis minor muscles, which cause the weight of the breasts to induce static and dynamic [[shear force]]s (when standing and when walking), compression forces (when lying supine), and tension forces (when kneeling on four limbs).
# '''Pectoralis fascia.''' The pectoralis major muscle is covered with a thin superficial membrane, the [[pectoral fascia]], which has many prolongations intercalated among its fasciculi (fascicles); at the midline, it is attached to the front of the [[sternum]], above it is attached to the [[clavicle]] (collar bone), while laterally and below, it is continuous with the fascia.
# '''Suspensory ligaments.''' The subcutaneous layer of [[adipose tissue]] in the breast is traversed with thin suspensory ligaments ([[Cooper's ligaments]]) that extend obliquely to the skin surface, and from the skin to the deep [[pectoral fascia]]. The structural stability provided by the Cooper's ligaments derives from its closely packed bundles of [[collagen]] fibers oriented in parallel; the principal, ligament-component cell is the [[fibroblast]], interspersed throughout the parallel collagen-fiber bundles of the shoulder, [[axilla]], and [[thorax]] ligaments.
# '''Glandular tissue.''' As a mammary gland, the breast comprises lobules (milk glands at each lobe-tip) and the [[lactiferous duct]]s (milk passages), which widen to form an ampulla (sac) at the nipple.
# '''Adipose tissue.''' The fat tissue of the breast is composed of [[Lipid|lipidic ﬂuid]] (60–85% weight) that is 90–99 per cent [[triglycerides]], free [[fatty acids]], [[diglycerides]], cholesterol [[phospholipids]], and minute quantities of [[cholesterol]] [[ester]]s, and [[monoglycerides]]; the other components are water (5–30% weight) and protein (2–3% weight).
# '''Fatty Tissue.''' In Biology, adipose tissue (/ˈædəˌpoʊs/) or body fat or fat depot or just fat is loose connective tissue composed of adipocytes. It is technically composed of roughly only 80% fat; fat in its solitary state exists in the liver and muscles. Adipose tissue is derived from lipoblasts. Its main role is to store energy in the form of lipids, although it also cushions and insulates the body. Far from hormonally inert, adipose tissue has in recent years been recognized as a major endocrine organ[1], as it produces hormones such as leptin, resistin, and the cytokine TNFα. Moreover, adipose tissue can affect other organ systems of the body and may lead to disease. Obesity or being overweight in humans and most animals does not depend on body weight but on the amount of body fat—to be specific, adipose tissue.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Two types of adipose tissue exist: white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). The formation of adipose tissue appears to be controlled in part by the adipose gene. Adipose tissue was first identified by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in 1551.
# '''The skin envelope.''' The breast skin is in three (3) layers: (i) the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], (ii) the [[dermis]], and (iii) the [[hypodermis]]. The epidermis is 50–100&nbsp;µm thick, and is composed of a [[stratum corneum]] of flat [[keratin]] cells, that is 10–20&nbsp;µm thick; it protects the underlying viable epidermis, which is composed of keratinizing [[Epithelium|epithelial cells]]. The dermis is mostly [[collagen]] and [[elastin]] ﬁbers embedded to a viscous water and [[glycoprotein]] medium. The fibers of the upper dermis ("papillary dermis") are thinner than the fibers of the deep dermis, thus the skin envelope is 1–3&nbsp;mm thick. The thickness of the hypodermis (adipocyte cells) varies from woman to woman, and body part.<ref>Gefen A, Dilomeyb B. Mechanics of the Normal Woman's Breast. Technology and Health Care 15 (2007) pp. 259–271 IOS Press</ref> The skin of the nipple and areola is further composed of a modified and specialized myoepthelium that is responsible for contraction in response to stimuli.

[[Image:Reductiontechniques.png|thumb|right|270px||Reduction mammoplasty: The vertical scar technique (lollipop incision) and the inferior pedicle flap technique (anchor incision) also are applicable to [[mastopexy|breast lift]] surgery.]]

;General
'''Reduction mammoplasty''', either surgery or lipectomy, proportionately re-sizes the enlarged, sagging breasts of a woman afflicted either with '''macromastia''' (<500 gm increase per breast) or with '''gigantomastia''' (<1,000 gm increase per breast). Breast reduction surgery has two (2) technical aspects: '''(i)''' the '''skin-incision pattern''' and the '''skin- and glandular-tissue excision technique''' applied for access to and removal of breast [[parenchyma]] tissue. The incision pattern and the area of skin-envelope tissue to be removed determine the locales and the lengths of the surgical scars; '''(ii)''' the final shape and contour of the reduced breast are determined by the area of the tissues remaining in the breast, and that the skin- and glandular-tissue pedicle has a proper supply of [[Innervation|nerves]] and blood vessels ([[Arterial blood|arterial]] and [[Venous blood|venous]]) that ensure its [[Histology|tissue viability]].<ref name="EspinosadelosMonteros" />

The specific reduction mammoplasty procedure is determined by the volume of breast tissues ([[Lactiferous duct|glandular]], [[Adipose tissue|adipose]], [[skin]]) to be resected (cut and removed) from each breast, and the degree of breast ptosis present: '''Pseudoptosis''' (sagging of the inferior pole of the breast; the nipple is at or above the inframammary fold); '''Grade I: Mild ptosis''' (the nipple is below the IMF, but above the lower pole of the breast); '''Grade II: Moderate ptosis''' (the nipple is below the IMF; yet some lower-pole breast tissue hangs lower than the nipple); '''Grade III: Severe ptosis''' (the nipple is far below the IMF; no breast tissue is below the nipple). The full, corrective outcome of the surgical re-establishment of a bodily-proportionate bust becomes evident at 6-months to 1-year post-opertaive, during which period the reduced and lifted breast tissues settle upon and into the chest. The post-operative convalescence is weeks long, depending upon the corrections performed; and some women might experience painful breast-enlargement during the first post-operative [[menstruation]].

;Contraindications
Breast reduction surgery cannot be performed if the woman is [[Lactation|lactating]], or has recently ceased lactating; if her breasts contain unevaluated [[Breast cancer|tissue masses]], or unidentified microcalcifications; if she is suffering a [[systemic illness]]; if she is unable to understand the technical limitations of the plastic surgery; and her inability to accept the possible [[Complication (medicine)|medical complications]] of the procedure.

;I. Inferior pedicle technique (Anchor pattern, inverted-T incision, Wise pattern)
The '''inferior pedicle''' (central mound) features a blood vessel supply (arterial and venous) for the nipple-areola complex (NAC) from an inferior, centrally-based attachment to the chest wall.<ref name="trials">[http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00149344 Vertical Scar Versus Inferior Pedicle Reduction Mammoplasty]. ClinicalTrials.gov</ref> The skin pedicle maintains the [[innervation]] and [[Circulatory system|vascular]] viability of the NAC, which produces a reduced, sensitive breast with full [[lactation]]al capability and function.<ref name="kakagia">{{cite journal |author=Kakagia D, Tripsiannis G, Tsoutsos D |title=Breastfeeding after Reduction Mammaplasty: a Comparison of 3 Techniques |journal=Annals of Plastic Surgery |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=343–345 |year=2005  |pmid=16186694 |doi= 10.1097/01.sap.0000179167.18733.97|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0148-7043&volume=55&issue=4&spage=343}}</ref> The volume and size reduction of [[Hypertrophy of breast|hypertrophied breasts]] is performed with a periareolar incision to the nipple-areola complex, which then extends downwards, following the natural curve of the breast hemisphere. After cutting and removing the requisite quantities of tissue (glandular, adipose, skin), the nipple-areola complex is transposed higher upon the breast hemisphere; thereby the inferior pedicle technique produces an elevated bust with breasts that are proportionate to the woman's person. Nonetheless, breast-reduction with an inferior pedicle, occasionally produces breasts that appear squared; yet, the technique effectively reduces the very enlarged breasts of macromastia and gigantomastia.

;II. Vertical scar technique (lollipop incision)
The breast reduction performed with the vertical-scar technique usually produces a well-projected bust featuring breasts with short incision [[scar]]s and a nipple-areola complex (NAC) elevated by means of a pedicle (superior, medial, lateral) that maintains the [[Histology|biologic]] and [[Lactation|functional]] viability of the NAC. The increased projection of the reduced bust is achieved by medially gathering the folds of the skin-envelope and suturing the inner and outer portions of the remaining breast gland to provide a support pillar, and upward projection of the NAC . The vertical-scar reduction mammoplasty is best suited for removing small areas of the skin envelope and small volumes of internal tissues (glandular, adipose) from the lateral and the inferior portions of the breast hemisphere; thus the short incision scars. 

;III. Horizontal scar technique
The breast reduction performed with the horizontal-scar technique features a horizontal incision along the inframammary fold (IMF) and a nipple-areola complex (NAC) pedicle. To elevate the NAC, the technique usually employs either an inferior pedicle or an inferior-lateral pedicle, and features no vertical incision (like the Anchor pattern). The horizontal-scar technique best applies to the woman whose oversized breasts are too large for a vertical-incision technique (e.g. the lollipop pattern); and it has two therapeutic advantages: no vertical incision-scar to the breast hemisphere, and better healing of the periareolar scar of the transposed NAC. The potential disadvantages are box-shaped breasts with thick (hypertrophied) incision scars, especially at the inframammary fold.

;IV. Free nipple-graft technique
The breast reduction performed with the free nipple-graft technique transposes the nipple-areola complex (NAC) as a [[Histology|tissue]] [[Graft (surgery)|graft]] without a blood supply, without a skin and glandular pedicle. The therapeutic advantage is the greater volume of breast tissues (glandular, adipose, skin) that can be resected to produce a proportionate breast. The therapeutic disadvantage is a breast without a sensitive nipple-areola complex, and without [[lactation]]al capability. The medically indicated candidates are: the woman whose health presents a high risk of [[ischemia]] (localized [[Histology|tissue]] [[anemia]]) of the [[Areola|nipple-areola complex]], which might cause [[Necrosis|tissue necrosis]]; the [[Diabetes|diabetic]] woman; the woman who is a [[Tobacco smoking|tobacco smoker]]; the woman whose oversized breasts have an approximate NAC-to-IMF measure of 20&nbsp;cm; and the woman who has macromastia requires much resecting of the breast tissues. 

;V. Liposuction-only technique (lipectomy)
The breast reduction performed with the [[Liposuction|liposuction-only]] technique usually applies to the woman whose oversized breasts require the removal of a medium volume of internal tissue; and to the woman whose health precludes her being under the extended [[anaesthesia]] usual to surgical breast-reduction operations. The ideal lipectomy candidate is the woman whose low-density breasts are principally composed of [[adipose tissue]], have a relatively elastic skin envelope, and manifest mild [[Ptosis (breasts)|ptosis]]. The therapeutic advantages of the liposuction-only technique are the small incision-scars required for access to the breast interior, hence, a shorter post-operative healing period for the incision scars; the therapeutic disadvantage is limited breast-reduction volumes.<ref>Romana Grippaudo, F. Liposuction Only Breast Reduction. eMedicine.com</ref>

==Surgical techniques==

===Lejour technique breast reduction===

[[File:17492 Dr. Placik Breast Reduction Chicago Illinois Arlington Heights.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Breast reduction: the pre-operative aspects of severe ptosis and macromastia; the post-operative corrected breasts and the lifted bust.]]
The treatment of [[Hypertrophy of breast|macromastia and gigantomastia]] with the '''Lejour technique''' applies a vertical-incision, a superior pedicle, breast [[liposuction]], and wide undermining of the skin of the lower portion of the breast. The technical efficacy of the Lejour breast reduction was established with the study ''Vertical Mammaplasty and Liposuction of the Breast'' (1994), which reported 153 reduction mammoplasties performed in 79 patients, wherein an average fat volume of 300 ml was removed from each breast, and the average resection of 480 gm of parenchymal tissue was removed from each breast.<ref>Lejour M. Vertical Mammaplasty and Liposuction of the Breast. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. July 1994;94(1):100–114.</ref>
								
;Pre-operative matters
The [[Medical record|medical treatment records]] for the reduction mammoplasty are established with pre-operative, multi-perspective photographs of the oversized breasts, the sternal-notch–to-nipple distances, and the nipple-to–inframammary-fold distances. The woman is instructed about the purposes of the breast reduction surgery, the achievable corrections, the expected final size, shape, and contour of the reduced breasts, the expected final appearance of the breast reduction [[scar]]s; possible changes in the sensation of the [[Areola|nipple-areola complex]] (NAC), possible changes in her [[Breastfeeding|breast-feeding]] capability, and possible [[Complication (medicine)|medical complications]]. The woman also is instructed about post-operative matters such as convalescence and the proper care of the surgical wounds to the breasts.

'''Incision-plan delineation —''' To the breasts of the standing patient, the plastic surgeon delineates the '''mosque dome''' skin-incision-plan, and the area representing the superior pedicle (composed of skin and glandular tissues), the breast midline, the inframammary fold (IMF), and the vertical axis of the breast, beneath the IMF. The upper-edge of the (future) nipple-areola complex (NAC) is marked slightly below the IMF-level, and a semicircle of 16-cm maximum diameter. In relation to the vertical axis, the mosque dome incision plan displaces the breast to the middle and to the side; the peripheral limbs of the incision plan are marked so that they approximate (join) at no less than 5-cm above the inframammary fold. The circumference of the (future) nipple-areola complex is delineated around the nipple, and a superior pedicle (10-cm wide minimum) is delineated at the upper-border of the future NAC circumference; the incision-plan delineation continues down as a cone, and around the marked circumference.

;Operative technique
The patient is laid supine upon the operating table so that the surgeon can later raise her to a sitting position that will allow visual comparison of the drape of the breasts, and an accurate assessment of the post-operative symmetry of the reduced and lifted bust. Afterwards, the pedicle epidermis surrounding the NAC (nipple-areola complex) is cut, and adipose tissue is liposuctioned from the breast. The medial, lower, and lateral segments of the breast are resected (cut and removed), by undermining the skin below the lower curved line. Then, the nipple-areola complex is transposed higher upon the breast hemisphere. The pillars of [[Parenchyma|parenchymal tissue]] are approximated (joined), and the skin envelope is sutured.<ref>Kakagia D, Fragia K, Grekou A, Tsoutsos D.

;Notes
* '''Biological:''' The resected tissue is submitted to [[Pathology|histopathologic]] examination, because sub-clinical [[breast cancer]] foci occur in 0.1–0.9 per cent of the [[Histology|tissue]] specimens.

* '''Technical:''' The original '''Lejour technique''' incision plan had no horizontal limbs, and so did not produce horizontal scars; however, contemporary variants, such as the '''Modified Lejour Technique''', employ small, horizontal incisions along the inframammary fold, in order to avoid redundant skin folds, especially in the reduction of very oversized breasts.<ref>Azzam C, De Mey A. Vertical scar Mammaplasty in Gigantomastia: Retrospective Study of 115 patients Treated using the Modified Lejour Technique. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. May–June 2007;31(3):294–298.</ref>

;Post-operative matters
The woman is instructed to resume her normal life activities, and to eat a light diet, post-operative, on the day of the breast reduction surgery; to resume washing in a shower at 1-day post-operative; to avoid strenuous physical activity, and to wear a sports brassière; the convalescence regimen is for 3-months post-operative. She is also informed that the wrinkles at the bottom of the vertical limb of the scar usually resolve and fade within 1–6 months post-operative; yet some cases might require surgical revision of the vertical scar. Scheduled follow-up consultations ensure a satisfactory outcome to the breast reduction surgery, and facilitate the early identification and management of medical complications.

;Complications
The post-operative complications occurred included [[seroma]], [[Dehiscence|wound dehiscence]], [[hematoma]]; whereas partial NAC [[necrosis]] occurred in 10 per cent of the reduced breasts; yet, after refinement of the Lejour technique, the study ''Vertical Mammaplasty: Early Complications After 250 Personal Consecutive Cases'' (1999), reported a reduced incidence rate of 7.0 per cent in the 324 breast reductions performed in 167 patients.<ref>Lejour M. Vertical Mammaplasty: Early Complications After 250 Personal Consecutive Cases. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. September 1999;104(3):764–770.</ref> Moreover, the incidence of such post-operative complications is greater among the women whose breasts required large-volume resection of the [[parenchyma]]; in women who were [[Obesity|obese]]; in women who were [[Tobacco smoking|tobacco smokers]]; and in young women.<ref>Cunningham BL, Gear AJ, Kerrigan CL, Collins ED.

Annals of Plastic Surgery. February 2005;54(2):117–119.</ref> Furthermore, wound dehiscence, epidermolysis, [[adipose tissue]] necrosis, and [[infection]] occur less among women who undergo Lejour-technique breast reduction, than among women who undergo a periareolar, Anchor pattern breast-reduction, or an inferior-pedicle breast reduction. Nonetheless, bottom-edge asymmetry occurs more among Lejour-technique patients; the revision surgery rates can be up to 10 per cent. Moreover, the liposuctioning of the breast does not increase the rate of local medical complications; decreased NAC sensitivity occurs in 10 per cent of the women; and total NAC insensitivity occurs in 1.0 per cent of women.<ref>Hofmann AK, Wuestner–Hofmann MC, Bassetto F, Scarpa C, Mazzoleni F.

===Liposuction-only technique===

;History and viability
Early studies in 2000 <ref>Klein JA. Tumescent Technique, Tumescent Anesthesia & Microcannular Liposuction. St Louis: CV Mosby, 2000</ref><ref>Dryden RM, American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery Conference, Florida, February 2000.</ref> reported on the successful use of tumescent [[liposuction]] for breast reduction.  A significant study was undertaken in 2001 using tumescent liposuction alone for breast reduction on 250 patients.<ref name="Lanzer D 2002">Lanzer D, Breast Reduction with Liposuction. International Journal of Cosmetic Surgery and Aesthetic Dermatology, Volume 4, Number 3, 2002.</ref>  The study found breast reduction via liposuction to be consistently reproducible, the results showing no cases of loose skin or irregular shape and no reports of permanent sensation loss, scars, [[necrosis]]  or infection.

;Indications
The reduction of oversized breasts by liposuction only ('''lipectomy''') is indicated when a minor-to-moderate volume-reduction is required, and there is no [[Ptosis (breasts)|breast ptosis]] to correct.  However, in a 2001 study of 250 patients, nipple and breast elevation of between 3&nbsp;cm and 15&nbsp;cm was reported.<ref name="Lanzer D 2002"/>   Further indications for lipectomy are presented by: (i) the woman who requires a large-volume reduction, and wants un-scarred, sensate breasts, yet will accept a degree of ptosis; (ii) the woman who requires a secondary mammoplasty to correct an asymmetric breast, by up to one (1) brassière cup-size; and (iii) the girl afflicted with [[Hypertrophy of breast|virginal breast hypertrophy]], as a temporary procedure performed before the conclusion of her [[thelarche]] (the pubertal breast-growth phase), given the hypertrophy's high rate of recurrence.

;Contraindications
Breast reduction by liposuction only cannot be performed upon a woman whose [[mammogram]] indicates that the oversized breast is principally composed of hypertrophied [[Mammary gland|milk glands]]. Furthermore, liposuction mammoplasty also is contraindicated for any woman whose mammograms indicate the presence of unevaluated [[neoplasm]]s; likewise, the presence of a great degree of breast ptosis, and an inelastic skin envelope.<ref>Grippaudo FR, Kennedy DC, Tiwari P, Talavera F, Shenaq SM, Slenkovich NG.

;Pre-operative matters
'''Consultation —''' The plastic surgeon evaluates the elasticity of the skin envelope of each breast, and determines the degree of breast ptosis present. The woman is informed of the alternative, [[Surgery|surgical]] reduction techniques available for diminishing her oversized breasts; of the consequent surgical [[scar]]s; of the possible loss of breast sensation; of the possible impairment of [[lactation]] capability; and of the possible impairment of [[Breastfeeding|breast-feeding]] functions. The woman is further informed of the possible medical complications, and is shown surgical photographic records of the average outcomes of breast-reduction surgery. The surgeon answers the woman's questions to assist her in establishing realistic expectations ([[self-image]]) about the breast-reduction outcome possible with a lipectomy procedure; and that, should lipectomy not satisfactorily reduce the volume of her breasts, a secondary, surgical breast-reduction procedure can be performed later.

'''The measures of the bust —''' A liposuction mammoplasty procedure does not feature a surgical-incision plan delineated upon the woman's breasts, chest, and torso. Yet the measures of the bust are established in order to determine the required degree(s) of correction; thus, with the patient sitting erect, for each breast, the surgeon records the jugular-notch-to-nipple distances, the nipple-to-inframammary-fold distances, and any asymmetries. Afterwards, the [[Anaesthesia|anaesthetized]] patient is laid supine upon the operating table, with her arms laterally extended (abducted) in order to fully expose the breasts.

'''Anaesthestic preparation —''' To limit bleeding during the liposuction, the proper degree of vasoconstriction of the breast's circulatory system is established with an [[Anaesthesia|anaesthetic]] solution ([[lidocaine]] + [[epinephrine]] in [[saline solution]]) that is infiltrated to the deep and the superficial plains of each breast. Using a blunt-tip, multi-perforation [[cannula]], the anaesthetic infiltration begins at the deep plane of the breast, and continues as the cannula is withdrawn towards the superficial plane of the breast. The entire area of the breast is infiltrated with the anaesthetic solution until the tissues become tumescent (firm). Moreover, as required by the patient's physique, an intravenous (IV) pressure bag can be applied to hasten the infiltration; after the anaesthetic has numbed the breast, the plastic surgeon begins the lipectomy breast-reduction.

;Operative technique
The surgeon effects a stab incision just above the lateral aspect of the inframammary fold (IMF), piercing the skin 2-cm above the inframammary fold, in the midline. The pre-tunnelling is performed with the blunt-tip, multi-perforation cannula used to infiltrate the [[Anaesthesia|anaesthetic]] solution to the breast tissues. A blunt-tip, 4-mm cannula, connected either to a medical-grade vacuum pump or to a syringe, is used to aspirate (suck) the [[Adipose tissue|adipose fat]]. The cannula is maneuvered laterally (in fanning movements), beginning in the deep plane of the breast and concluding in the superficial plane of the breast; the [[Adipose tissue|adipose fat]] sucked from the breast is a yellow, fatty, bloodless fluid; the liposuction concludes upon drawing the required volume of fat, or when the fat becomes bloody.

After the liposuction, the superficial layer of [[Adipose tissue|adipose fat]] is undermined with a blunt-tip, 3-mm cannula (which is not connected to a vacuum pump). The breast ptosis is corrected by stimulating the controlled retraction of the incision scar, by undermining the superficial fat of the medial and the lateral upper areas of the breast; the maneuver tightens (retracts) the skin envelope of the breast. Procedurally, the liposuction-only breast reduction procedure concludes with the application of an elastic, foam-tape dressing that molds the reduced breast into its new shape, and lifts it higher upon the chest.

'''Technical note:''' For the reduction of very enlarged breasts, the plastic surgeon makes a supplementary incision just above the medial aspect of the inframammary fold. Procedurally, the placement of said incision later allows converting the lipectomy breast-reduction procedure into an '''inferior-pedicle breast reduction''' surgery, if liposuction proved inadequate to satisfactorily reducing the volume of the very enlarged breasts.<ref name="Grippaudo" />

;Post-operative matters
;Convalescence
The patient is discharged from hospital either the same day or the day after the breast reduction operation. Because the liposuction-only procedure featured only a few, small, surgical incisions, the woman quickly recovers her health, usually resuming daily life activities at 3-days post-operative — when the breast-molding dressings are changed; she also resumes her personal hygiene regimen to include washing under a water shower. In the initial convalescence period, the surgical-incision wounds are inspected at 1-week post-operative, during which time the woman has continuously worn a strapless brassière to contain and immobilize her corrected breasts; afterwards, she continuously wears a strapped brassière for 30 days after the breast-reduction operation.

;Complications
Early complications include [[infection]] and [[hematoma]] (blood outside the vascular system); late complications include an unsatisfactory breast-volume reduction that might require either [[Surgery|surgical]] or [[liposuction]] revision. As with other liposuction procedures, the final result of a liposuction-only breast reduction becomes evident at 6-months post-operative; although the [[edema]] usually subsides at 2–3 weeks post-operative. To date, no incidence of [[Histology|tissue]] [[necrosis]] has been reported; likewise, there have been few reports of lessened nipple-sensation. Generally, the long-term rate of patient-satisfaction is high, provided that the indications for the liposuction-only technique are abided with proper patient selection.<ref>Sadove R.
