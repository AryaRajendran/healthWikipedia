[http://www.jco.org/cgi/content/full/18/16/2938 HTML] [http://www.jco.org/cgi/reprint/18/16/2938.pdf PDF] Patients with advanced colorectal cancer were given 5-fluorouracil and leukovorin. Those who were also given oxaliplatin were more likely to have a response, and had longer progression-free survival, than patients without oxaliplatin. However, patients with oxaliplatin didn't survive any longer than patients without it.
