==Development history==
The research that led to the development of the vaccine began in the 1980s by groups at the [[University of Rochester]], [[Georgetown University]], and the US [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI). In 1991, Australian investigators [[Jian Zhou]] and [[Ian Frazer]] at [[The University of Queensland]] found a way to form non-infectious [[virus-like particle]]s (VLP), which could also strongly activate the immune system. However, these VLPs assembled poorly and did not have the same structure as infectious HPV. In 1993, a laboratory at the US National Cancer Institute was able to generate HPV16 VLPs that were morphologically correct. These VLPs were the basis for the HPV16 component of the Gardasil vaccine.<ref name=McNeil>

===Clinical trials===
Merck & Co. conducted a Phase III study named Females United to Unilaterally Reduce Endo/Ectocervical Disease (FUTURE II). This clinical trial was a randomized [[double-blind study]] with one controlled [[placebo]] group and one vaccination group. Over 12,000 women aged 16–26 from thirteen countries participated in the study. Each woman was injected with either Gardasil or a placebo on day 1, month 2, and month 6. In total, 6,082 women were given Gardasil and 6,075 received the placebo.<ref name="pmid17494925">

==Indications and prevalence==
{{Main|HPV vaccine#Prevalence of genital HPV}}

Gardasil is a prophylactic HPV vaccine, meaning that it is designed to prevent HPV infections. For maximum effect, it is recommended that girls receive the vaccine prior to becoming sexually active. However, women who were already infected with one or more of the four HPV types targeted by the vaccine (6, 11, 16, or 18) were protected from clinical disease caused by the remaining HPV types in the vaccine.

Since Gardasil will not block infection with all of the HPV types that can cause cervical cancer, the vaccine should not be considered a substitute for routine [[pap smear]]s.

Fewer HPV infections mean fewer complications from the virus and less time and money spent on the detection, work-up, and treatment of cervical cancer and its precursor, cervical dysplasia. It prevents infertility caused by cervical biopsies and reduces the severe respiratory problems of children who are infected by HPV from their mothers.

In addition, protection against HPV 6 and HPV 11 is expected to eliminate 90% of the cases of genital warts. Gardasil also protects against [[vulvar cancer|vulvar]] and [[vaginal cancer]]s caused by HPV types 16 and 18.<ref name=VulvarCA>

===Biotechnology===
The HPV major [[capsid]] protein, L1, can spontaneously self-assemble into [[virus-like particle]]s (VLPs) that resemble authentic HPV [[virion]]s. Gardasil contains [[recombinant virus|recombinant]] VLPs assembled from the L1 proteins of HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18. Since VLPs lack the viral [[DNA]], they cannot induce cancer. They do, however, trigger an [[antibody]] response that protects vaccine recipients from becoming infected with the HPV types represented in the vaccine. The L1 proteins are produced by separate [[ethanol fermentation|fermentations]] in recombinant ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and self-assembled into VLPs.<ref name=gardasilPI />

==Efficacy==
The [[National Cancer Institute]] says, "Studies have shown that both Gardasil and [[Cervarix]] prevent nearly 100 percent of the precancerous cervical cell changes caused by the types of HPV targeted by the vaccine for up to 4 years after vaccination among women who were not infected at the time of vaccination."<ref name="National Cancer Institute HPV Q&A" />

Gardasil has been shown to be partially effective (approximately 38%) in preventing cervical cancer caused by ten other high-risk HPV types.<ref>

==Public health advantages==
{{Main|HPV Vaccine}}

The [[National Cancer Institute]] writes:
:Widespread vaccination has the potential to reduce cervical cancer deaths around the world by as much as two-thirds, if all women were to take the vaccine and if protection turns out to be long-term. In addition, the vaccines can reduce the need for medical care, biopsies, and invasive procedures associated with the follow-up from abnormal Pap tests, thus helping to reduce health care costs and anxieties related to abnormal Pap tests and follow-up procedures.<ref name="National Cancer Institute HPV Q&A">

===Long-term impact and cost-effectiveness===
{{Update|date=July 2009}}

One unknown property of the vaccines now being researched is the persistence of their protective effects. Since the Gardasil vaccine has been administered for only a few years now, it is unknown whether it will provide lifelong immunity to recipients. In coming decades, further study will answer this question.

Whether the effects are temporary or lifelong, widespread vaccination could have a substantial public health impact. 270,000 women died of cervical cancer worldwide in 2002.<ref name="pmid15860602">{{cite journal

Merck and [[CSL Limited]] are expected to market Gardasil as a cancer vaccine, rather than an [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] vaccine.

However, the messages and the methods by which the vaccine was marketed present important challenges to physician practice and medical professionalism. By making the vaccine's target disease cervical cancer, the sexual transmission of HPV was minimized, the threat of cervical cancer to adolescents was maximized, and the subpopulations most at risk practically ignored. The vaccine manufacturer also provided educational grants to professional medical associations (PMAs) concerned with adolescent and women's health and oncology. The funding encouraged many PMAs to create educational programs and product-specific speakers' bureaus to promote vaccine use. However, much of the material did not address the full complexity of the issues surrounding the vaccine and did not provide balanced recommendations on risks and benefits. As important and appropriate as it is for PMAs to advocate for vaccination as a public good, their recommendations must be consistent with appropriate and cost-effective use.<ref>

In an address at the [[4th International Public Conference on Vaccination]] sponsored by the [[anti-vaccination]] group the [[National Vaccine Information Center]] in October 2009, Diane Harper stated that in countries where Pap smear screening is common, it will take vaccination of a large proportion of women in order to further reduce cervical cancer rates.

=== Canada === 
In July 2006 the developments by Merck & Co had led to Gardasil being introduced to Canada. The vaccine was developed to prevent the HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 from infecting those who are sexually active. The need for the vaccine in Canada was a result of HPV being one of the most frequently occurring sexually transmitted diseases in the country.  However, the way the government and pharmaceutical companies went about campaigning the vaccine throughout the country proved to be problematic. As a result of the target audience for the vaccine being females between the ages of 9-26, the Canadian government turned to the school system to administer the vaccine.  The Canadian Federal government used $300 million in three years to help administer the vaccine throughout schools. In 2007 the provincial school-based programs used the money to vaccinate school age children.  In 2007 debates among the public became prominent as a result of the provincial governments targeting children in grade 8 for the vaccine. The debates became controversial because of the age range used to be immunized and because at the time the vaccine was starting to be used, there was no long-term data provided from clinical trials. Issues also arose from the campaigns used for the vaccine because the young females being vaccinated were not taken into consideration in regards to how they felt about being vaccinated.<ref>http://resources.cpha.ca/immunize.ca/data/1790e.pdf.</ref>
