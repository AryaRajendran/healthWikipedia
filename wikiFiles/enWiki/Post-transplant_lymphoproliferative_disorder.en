'''Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder''' (PTLD) is the name given to a [[B-cell]] proliferation due to therapeutic immunosuppression after organ transplantation. These patients may develop infectious mononucleosis-like lesions or polyclonal polymorphic B-cell hyperplasia. Some of these [[B-cells]] may undergo mutations which will render them malignant, giving rise to a [[lymphoma]].{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In some patients, the malignant cell clone can become the dominant proliferating cell type, leading to frank lymphoma, a group of [[B cell]] [[lymphoma]]s occurring in [[Immunosuppression|immunosuppressed]] patients following [[organ transplant]].

==Causes==
The disease is an uncontrolled proliferation of B cell [[lymphocytes]] following infection with [[Epstein-Barr virus]].<ref name="pmid15660500">{{cite journal |author=Gottschalk S, Rooney CM, Heslop HE |title=Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders |journal=Annu. Rev. Med. |volume=56 |issue= 1|pages=29â€“44 |year=2005 |pmid=15660500 |doi=10.1146/annurev.med.56.082103.104727 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.med.56.082103.104727?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}</ref> Production of an [[interleukin-10]], an endogenous anti-T cell [[cytokine]], has also been implicated.

In immunocompetent patients, Epstein-Barr virus causes [[infectious mononucleosis]], characterised by a proliferation of B-lymphocytes which is controlled by [[Suppressor T cells]]. 

However, calcineurin inhibitors ([[tacrolimus]] and [[cyclosporine]]), used as immunosuppressants in organ transplantation inhibit [[T cell]] function, and can prevent the control of the B cell proliferation.

Depletion of T cells by use of anti-T cell [[Antibody|antibodies]] in the prevention or treatment of [[transplant rejection]] further increases the risk of developing post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Such antibodies include [[Anti-thymocyte globulin|ATG]], [[Anti-lymphocyte globulin|ALG]] and [[OKT3]].

Polyclonal PTLD may form tumor masses and present with symptoms due to a mass effect, e.g. symptoms of [[bowel obstruction]]. Monoclonal forms of PTLD tend to form a disseminated malignant lymphoma.

==Treatment==
PTLD may spontaneously regress on reduction or cessation of [[Immunosuppression|immunosuppressant]] medication,<ref name="urlHematopathology">{{cite web |url=http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/HEMEHTML/HEME099.html |title=Hematopathology |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> and can also be treated with addition of anti-viral therapy. In some cases it will progress to [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and may be fatal.
