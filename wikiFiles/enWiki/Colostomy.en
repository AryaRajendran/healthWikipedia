A '''colostomy''' is a [[surgery|surgical]] procedure in which a [[Stoma (medicine)|stoma]] is formed by drawing the healthy end of the [[large intestine]] or [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] through an [[incision]] in the [[anterior abdominal wall]] and [[Surgical suture|suturing]] it into place.  This opening, in conjunction with the attached [[Ostomy pouching system|stoma appliance]], provides an alternative channel for [[feces]] to leave the body.  It may be reversible or irreversible depending on the circumstances.

== Indications ==
There are many reasons for this procedure.  Some common reasons are:
*A [http://www.pedisurg.com/ImagesPtEduc/colostomy.gif section] of the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] has been removed, e.g. due to [[colon cancer]] requiring a [[total mesorectal excision]], [[diverticulitis]], injury, etc., so that it is no longer possible for feces to exit via the [[anus]].
*A portion of the colon (or large intestine) has been operated upon and needs to be 'rested' until it is healed. In this case, the colostomy is often temporary and is usually reversed at a later date, leaving the patient with a small [[scar]] in place of the stoma.  Children undergoing surgery for extensive [[pelvic tumor]]s commonly are given a colostomy in preparation for surgery to remove the tumor, followed by [[colostomy reversal|reversal]] of the colostomy.
*[[Fecal incontinence]] that is non responsive to other treatments.

== Options ==
Placement of the stoma on the [[abdomen]] can occur at any location along the colon, but the most common placement is on the lower left side near the [[sigmoid colon|sigmoid]] where a majority of colon cancers occur. Other locations include the [[ascending colon|ascending]], [[transverse colon|transverse]], and [[descending colon|descending]] sections of the colon.<ref>Potter et al.

*'''Loop colostomy:''' This type of colostomy is usually used in emergencies and is a temporary and large [[Stoma (medicine)|stoma]]. A loop of the bowel is pulled out onto the abdomen and held in place with an external device. The bowel is then sutured to the abdomen and two openings are created in the one stoma: one for stool and the other for mucus.
*'''End colostomy:''' A stoma is created from one end of the bowel. The other portion of the bowel is either removed or sewn shut (Hartmann's procedure).
*'''Double barrel colostomy:''' The bowel is severed and both ends are brought out onto the abdomen. Only the proximal stoma is functioning.

Colostomy surgery that is pre-planned usually has a higher rate of long-term success than surgery performed in an emergency situation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

People with colostomies must wear an [[ostomy pouching system]] to collect intestinal waste.  Ordinarily the pouch must be emptied or changed a couple of times a day depending on the frequency of activity; in general the further from the [[anus]] (i.e., the further 'up' the intestinal tract) the ostomy is located the greater the output and more frequent the need to empty or change the pouch.<ref name=UOAA>{{cite web|title=Colostomy irrigation: Colostomy Guide|url=http://www.ostomy.org/ostomy_info/pubs/ColostomyGuide.pdf|publisher=United Ostomy Associations of America|accessdate=4 February 2013}}</ref>

=== Colostomy with irrigation ===
People with colostomies who have ostomies of the [[sigmoid colon]] or [[descending colon]] may have the option of irrigation, which allows for the person to not wear a pouch, but rather just a gauze cap over the stoma, and to schedule irrigation for times that are convenient.<ref name=ostomy>{{cite web|last=Rooney|first=Debra|title=Colostomy irrigation: A personal account managing colostomy|url=http://www.ostomy.org/ostomy_info/pubs/Phoenix_Irrigation.pdf|publisher=Ostomy|accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> To irrigate, a [[catheter]] is placed inside the stoma, and flushed with water, which allows the feces to come out of the body into an irrigation sleeve.<ref name=webmed>{{cite web|last=Wax|first=Arnold|title=What is colostomy irrigation?|url=http://www.webmd.com/colorectal-cancer/colostomy-irrigation|publisher=WebMed|accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> Most colostomates irrigate once a day or every other day, though this depends on the person, their food intake, and their health.

In place of an external [[Prosthesis|appliance]], an internal ileo-anal pouch is constructed using a portion of the patient's lower intestine, to act as a new [[rectum]] to replace the removed original.
