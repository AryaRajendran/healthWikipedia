In the [[United States]], the '''chargemaster''', also known as '''charge description master''' ('''CDM'''), is a comprehensive listing of items billable to a [[hospital]] [[patient]] or a patient's [[health insurance]] provider, with highly [[inflate]]d [[price]]s at several times that of actual [[cost]]s to the hospital. The chargemaster typically serves as the starting point for [[negotiation]]s with patients and health insurance providers of what amount of money will actually be paid to the hospital. It is described as "the central mechanism of the revenue cycle" of a hospital.

==Description==
The chargemaster may be alternatively referred to as the "hospital chargemaster", or the "charge description master" (CDM).<ref name="peden">{{cite book|last=Peden|first=Ann|title=Comparative Health Information Management|pages=41–43|year=2011|publisher=Delmar Cengage Learning|isbn=1111125627}}</ref><ref name="howard">{{cite book|first=Carla |last=Tyson-Howard|coauthors= Shirlyn C.

The procedure of defining the chargemaster pricing scheme often necessitates multiple hospital employees working under the supervision of a "chargemaster coordinator".<ref name="abbey">{{cite book|last=Abbey|first=Duane C.|pages=2–4|title=Chargemasters: Strategies to Ensure Accurate Reimbursement and Compliance|publisher=Opus Communications|year=2005|isbn=1578396301}}</ref><ref name="davis" /> Ultimate responsibility for putting together and reviewing the chargemaster rests with each hospital's [[chief financial officer]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/hastings_center_report/v037/37.4schneider.pdf|title=The Cash Nexus|first=Carl E. |last=Schneider|journal=Hastings Center Report |volume= 37|issue=4|date= July 2007|pages= 11–12 | doi=10.1353/hcr.2007.0061|publisher=Project MUSE}}</ref> Approximately forty percent of hospitals pay outside companies to help create and then adapt their chargemasters on a yearly basis.<ref name="davis">{{cite book|last=Davis|first=T.

Authors [[J.

==Existing legislation and regulations==
In [[California]], a regulation known as the "[[Payers' Bill of Rights]]" (which is unique to the state) requires all hospitals to provide their chargemaster to the state, which then posts them online for the public.<ref name=oshpd /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/racs-/-icd-9-/-icd-10/report-surgery-prices-vary-wildly-at-california-hospitals.html |title=Report: Surgery Prices Vary Wildly at California Hospitals |first=Bob |last=Herman |work=Becker's Hospital Review |date=July 16, 2012 |accessdate=March 4, 2013|publisher=ASC Communications}}</ref>

The chargemaster procedure is generally only regulated in [[Maryland]]; author Peter Reid Kongstvedt notes in ''Essentials of Managed Care'', "Of particular importance, other than in Maryland, hospitals are generally free to charge whatever they want in their chargemaster."<ref name="kongstvedt" />

==Critical analysis==
Chargemasters gained national attention in a critical ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover story published February 20, 2013, titled "Bitter Pill: Why Medical Bills Are Killing Us".<ref name="brill">{{cite news |url=http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/20/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us/print/ |title=Bitter Pill: Why Medical Bills Are Killing Us |first=Steven |last=Brill |authorlink=Steven Brill (journalist)|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher=[[Time Warner]]|date=February 20, 2013|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}</ref> Reporter [[Steven Brill (journalist)|Steven Brill]] examined the overlooked role that chargemasters play in the American health care system's cost crisis, asserting that they routinely list extremely high prices "devoid of any calculation related to cost", and are generally regarded as "fiction" in the healthcare industry, despite their significant role in setting prices for both insured and uninsured patients alike.<ref name="brill" />

"The 'full charges' reflected on hospital Charge Masters are unconscionable", wrote George A. Nation III in a 2005 piece for the ''Kentucky Law Journal''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Obscene Contracts: The Doctrine of Unconscionability and Hospital Billing of the Uninsured |first=George A. |last=Nation III |journal=Kentucky Law Journal |year=2005 |page=101 |volume=94 |publisher=[[University of Kentucky College of Law]]}}</ref> [[Health care economics|Health care economist]] scholar [[Uwe Reinhardt]] noted in a 2006 article for ''[[Health Affairs]]'' that the approach to chargemasters by hospitals would have to be modified to become more transparent, in order to encourage a form of [[consumer-driven health care]] to help improve the system.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Uwe|last=Reinhardt|authorlink=Uwe Reinhardt|journal=[[Health Affairs]]|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/25/1/57.short|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.25.1.57|date=January 2006|volume=25|issue=1|pages=57–69|title=The Pricing Of U.S. Hospital Services: Chaos Behind A Veil Of Secrecy}}</ref> [[University of California, Berkeley]] professor of [[health economics]] James C. Robinson pointed out prior criticism of the chargemaster, "Much ink has been spilt bemoaning that incomprehensible foundation of hospital cost accounting and prices, the redoubtable chargemaster."<ref name="jamescrobinson" /> Robinson called for greater transparency as well as increased price standardization as steps to help remedy the situation.<ref name="jamescrobinson">{{cite journal|first=James C.|last=Robinson|url=http://bcht.berkeley.edu/docs/Price-Transparency-Begins-at-Home.pdf|title=Price Transparency Begins at Home|pages=25–28|volume=23|issue=3|journal=Frontiers of Health Services Management|publisher=[[American College of Healthcare Executives]]|year=2007}}</ref> 

In a 2007 article for ''Health Affairs'', Gerard F. Anderson observed, "Without knowing what services they will use in advance, it is impossible for patients to comparison shop."<ref name="gfanderson">{{cite journal|journal=[[Health Affairs]]|first=Gerard F.|last=Anderson|title=From 'Soak The Rich' To 'Soak The Poor': Recent Trends In Hospital Pricing |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.26.3.780 |date=May 2007 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=780–789 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/26/3/780.short |publisher=Project HOPE: The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.}}</ref> Anderson also noted the esoteric nature of the language on the chargemaster made it difficult for patients and anyone other than hospital administrators to understand.<ref name="gfanderson" /> Anderson emphasized the difficulty of patients' ability to interpret the chargemaster in a subsequent 2012 article: "Furthermore, most of the items on the charge master file are written in code so that only the hospital administrators and a few experts in the field can interpret their meanings."<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Gerard |last1=Anderson |last2=Chalkidou |first2=Kalipso |last3=Herring |first3=Bradley |title=High US Health-Care Spending and the Importance of Provider Payment Rates |url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/fhep.2012.15.issue-3/fhep-2012-0007/fhep-2012-0007.xml |year=2012 |month=September |journal=Forum for Health Economics & Policy |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=1–22 |issn=1558-9544 |doi=10.1515/fhep-2012-0007}}</ref>
