'''''Entamoeba coli''''' is a non-pathogenic [[species]] of ''[[Entamoeba]]'' that frequently exists as a [[commensal]] [[parasite]] in the human [[gastrointestinal tract]]. ''E. coli'' (not to be confused with the [[Bacteria|bacterium]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]'') is important in medicine because it can be confused during microscopic examination of stained stool specimens with the [[pathogen]]ic ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]''.<ref name=Baron>{{cite book | author = Sodeman WA  | chapter =  Intestinal Protozoa: Amebas | title = Baron's Medical Microbiology ''(Baron S ''et al.'', eds.)| edition = 4th | publisher = Univ of Texas Medical Branch | year = 1996 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.4136#4149 | isbn = 0-9631172-1-1 }}</ref> While this differentiation is typically done by visual examination of the parasitic cysts via [[Microscope|light microscopy]], new methods using [[molecular biology]] techniques have been developed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Verweij JJ, Laeijendecker D, Brienen EA, van Lieshout L, Polderman AM |title=Detection and identification of entamoeba species in stool samples by a reverse line hybridization assay |journal=J.

==Clinical significance==
[[File:Entaemoeba coli cyst 6 nuclei.png|thumb|Entamoeba coli cyst with more than 4 nuclei]]
The presence of ''E.coli'' is not cause in and of itself to seek treatment as it is considered harmless.<ref name="urlIntestinal and Luminal Protozoa">{{cite web |url=http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/parasitology/intest-protozoa.htm |title=Intestinal and Luminal Protozoa |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref> However, when a person becomes infected with this benign entamoeba, other [[pathogenic]] organisms may have been introduced as well, and these other pathogens might cause infection or illness.<ref name="CDC">{{cite web | title = Nonpathogenic Intestinal Amebae Infection | work = Parasitic Disease Information | url = http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/amebae/factsht_amebae.htm | publisher = CDC | date = 2004-09-29 | accessdate = 2007-08-10}}</ref>

==Distinguishing characteristics==
''E. Coli'' [[trophozoites]] can be distinguished by their wide and tapered [[pseudopodia]]. They are often mistaken for [[Entamoeba histolytica|''E. histolytica'']] due to their overlap in size. The cysts are distinguished by noticing the eight nuclei found in the mature form.<ref>http://www.tulane.edu/~wiser/protozoology/notes/intes.html</ref>
