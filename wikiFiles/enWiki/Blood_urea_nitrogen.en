The liver produces urea in the [[urea cycle]] as a waste product of the [[digestion]] of [[protein]].  Normal human adult blood should contain between 7 to 21 [[milligram|mg]] of urea nitrogen per 100 [[milliliter|ml]] (7â€“21&nbsp;mg/[[deciliter|dL]]) of blood. Individual laboratories may have different [[Reference ranges for blood tests|reference range]]s, and this is because the procedure may vary.<ref name=firstaid>Last page of {{cite book |author=Deepak A.

==Interpretation==
BUN is an indication of renal health.  Normal ranges 8-20 mmol/L.  If [[Glomerular filtration rate|Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)]] and blood volume decrease ([[hypovolemia]]) then BUN will increase.Other factors responsible for its increment are fever, increased catabolism, high protein diet and gastrointestinal bleeding.

==Units==
BUN (urea-N) is g/dL in the United States, Mexico, Italy, Austria, Germany. Elsewhere, the concentration of urea is reported as mmol/L, generally depending on the lab.

To convert from mg/dL of blood urea nitrogen to mmol/L of urea, multiply by 0.357 (each molecule of urea having 2 nitrogens, each of molar mass 14g/mol)
::Urea [mmol/L] = BUN [mg/dL of [[nitrogen]]] x 10 [dL/L] / 14x2  [mg N/mmol urea]

convert BUN to urea in mg/dL by using following formula:
::Urea [mg/dL]= BUN [mg/dL] * 2.14

(conversion factor derived by: MW of urea = 60, MW of urea nitrogen = 14x2 => 60/28 = 2.14)

factor = 1 for conversions in mmol (1 mole N2 = 2 moles N per mole of urea):
::BUN [mmol/L]= urea [mmol/L]
