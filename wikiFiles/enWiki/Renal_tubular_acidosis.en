'''Renal tubular acidosis''' ('''RTA''') is a medical condition that involves an accumulation of acid in the body due to a failure of the [[kidney]]s to appropriately [[wiktionary:acidify|acidify]] the [[urine]].<ref name=laing>{{cite journal |author=Laing CM, Toye AM, Capasso G, Unwin RJ |title=Renal tubular acidosis: developments in our understanding of the molecular basis |journal=Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=1151–61 |year=2005|pmid=15778079 |doi=10.1016/j.biocel.2005.01.002 |url=}}</ref>  When blood is filtered by the kidney, the [[wiktionary:filtrate|filtrate]] passes through the [[tubules]] of the [[nephron]], allowing for exchange of salts, acid equivalents, and other [[wiktionary:solutes|solutes]] before it drains into the [[urinary bladder|bladder]] as [[urine]].  The [[metabolic acidosis]] that results from RTA may be caused either by failure to recover sufficient ([[alkaline]]) [[bicarbonate]] ions from the filtrate in the early portion of the nephron ([[proximal tubule]]) or by insufficient secretion of ([[acid]]) [[hydrogen ions]] into the latter portions of the nephron ([[distal tubule]]).  Although a metabolic acidosis also occurs in those with [[renal insufficiency]], the term RTA is reserved for individuals with poor urinary acidification in otherwise well-functioning kidneys.  Several different types of RTA exist, which all have different syndromes and different causes.

The word ''[[acidosis]]'' refers to the tendency for RTA to lower the blood's pH.  When the blood pH is below normal (7.35), this is called ''[[acidemia]]''.  The metabolic acidosis caused by RTA is a [[normal anion gap acidosis]].

An overview of types 1, 2, and 4 is presented below (type 3 is usually excluded from modern classifications):

==Type 1-Distal RTA==
{{main|distal renal tubular acidosis}}
[[Image:XrayRicketsLegssmall.jpg|thumb|right|[[Radiograph]] of a child with [[rickets]], a complication of both distal and proximal RTA.]]
Distal RTA ('''dRTA''') is the classical form of RTA, being the first described. Distal RTA is characterized by a failure of acid secretion by the alpha intercalated [[cell (biology)|cell]]s of the [[cortical collecting duct]] of the [[distal]] [[nephron]]. This failure of acid secretion may be due to a number of causes, and it leads to an inability to acidify the urine to a [[pH]] of less than 5.3. Because renal excretion is the primary means of eliminating acid from the body, there is consequently a tendency towards [[acidemia]]. There is an inability to excrete {{chem|link=Hydron (chemistry)|H|+}} while {{chem|link=Potassium|K|+}} cannot be reabsorbed, leading to acidemia (as {{chem|H|+}} builds up in the body) and hypokalemia (as {{chem|K|+}} cannot be reabsorbed).
This leads to the clinical features of dRTA;<ref name=laing/> In other words, the intercalated cells' apical H+/K+ antiporter is non-functional, resulting in potassium-wasting and proton retention. Since calcium stones demonstrate a proclivity for deposition at higher pHs (alkaline), the substance of the kidney develops stones bilaterally; this does not occur in the other RTA types.

==Type 2-Proximal RTA==
{{main|proximal renal tubular acidosis}}
Proximal RTA ('''pRTA''') is caused by a failure of the [[proximal tubular]] cells to reabsorb filtered bicarbonate from the urine, leading to urinary bicarbonate wasting and subsequent acidemia. The distal intercalated cells function normally, so the acidemia is less severe than dRTA and the urine can acidify to a pH of less than 5.3.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rodriguez Soriano J, Boichis H, Stark H, Edelmann CM |title=Proximal renal tubular acidosis. A defect in bicarbonate reabsorption with normal urinary acidification |journal=Pediatr. Res. |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=81–98 |year=1967 |pmid=6029811 }}</ref> pRTA also has several causes, and may occasionally be present as a solitary defect, but is usually associated with a more generalized dysfunction of the proximal tubular cells called [[Fanconi's syndrome]], in which there is also [[phosphaturia]], [[glycosuria]], aminoaciduria, uricosuria, and tubular [[proteinuria]].
The principal feature of Fanconi's syndrome is bone demineralization ([[osteomalacia]] or [[rickets]]) due to phosphate wasting.

==Type 3 RTA-Combined proximal and distal RTA==

In some patients, their RTA shares features of both dRTA and pRTA. This rare pattern was observed in the 1960s and 1970s as a transient phenomenon in infants and children with dRTA (possibly in relation with some exogenous factor such as high salt intake) and is no longer observed.<ref name="jrs">{{cite journal |author=Rodríguez Soriano J |title=Renal tubular acidosis: the clinical entity |journal=J.

Combined dRTA and pRTA is also observed as the result of inherited [[carbonic anhydrase]] II deficiency. Mutations in the gene encoding this enzyme give rise to an autosomal recessive syndrome of [[osteopetrosis]], renal tubular acidosis, [[Cerebrum|cerebral]] [[calcification]], and mental retardation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sly WS, Whyte MP, Sundaram V, ''et al.'' |title=Carbonic anhydrase II deficiency in 12 families with the autosomal recessive syndrome of osteopetrosis with renal tubular acidosis and cerebral calcification |journal=N.

The kidney problems are treated as described above. There is no treatment for the osteopetrosis or cerebral calcification.

Type 3 is rarely discussed.<ref name=emed>{{EMedicine|article|242494|Hyporeninemic Hypoaldosteronism}}</ref> Most comparisons of RTA are limited to a comparison of types 1, 2, and 4.

==Type 4 RTA==
[[Image:Aldosterone-2D-skeletal.svg|thumb|Type 4 RTA is due either to a deficiency of [[Aldosterone]], or to a resistance to its effects.]]
Type 4 RTA is not actually a tubular disorder at all nor does it have a clinical syndrome similar to the other types of RTA described above. It was included in the classification of renal tubular acidoses as it is associated with a mild (normal anion gap) metabolic acidosis due to a ''physiological'' reduction in proximal tubular [[ammonium]] excretion (impaired ammoniagenesis), which is secondary to [[hypoaldosteronism]], and results in a decrease in urine buffering capacity. Its cardinal feature is [[hyperkalemia]], and measured urinary acidification is normal, hence it is often called hyperkalemic RTA or tubular hyperkalemia.<ref name=emed/> 

Causes include:
*Aldosterone deficiency ([[hypoaldosteronism]]): Primary vs. hyporeninemic
*[[Aldosterone]] resistance
#Drugs: [[NSAID]]s, [[ACE inhibitors]] and [[ARB]]s, [[Eplerenone]], [[Spironolactone]], [[Trimethoprim]], [[Pentamidine]]
#[[Pseudohypoaldosteronism]]

==History==
Renal tubular acidosis was first described in 1935 by Lightwood and 1936 by Butler et al. in children.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lightwood R. |title=Communication no. 1 |journal=Arch Dis Child |volume=10 |pages=205–6 |year=1935 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Butler AM, Wilson JL, Farber S |title=Dehydration and acidosis with calcification at renal tubules |journal=J Pediat |volume=8 |pages=489–99 |year=1936 }}</ref>  Baines et al. first described it in adults in 1945.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baines AM, Barelay JA, Cooke WT |title=Nephrocalcinosis associated with hyperchloremia and low plasma-bicarbonate |journal=Q J Med |volume=14 |pages=113–23 |year=1945 }}</ref>

It has been postulated the [[Dickens]] character, [[Tiny Tim (A Christmas Carol)|Tiny Tim]] in [[A Christmas Carol]], was suffering from renal tubular acidosis. <ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1340779</ref>
