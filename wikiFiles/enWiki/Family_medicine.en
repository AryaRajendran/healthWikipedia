'''Family medicine''' ('''FM'''), formerly '''Family Practice''' ('''FP'''), is a [[Specialty (medicine)|medical specialty]] devoted to comprehensive health care for people of all ages; the specialist is named a '''family physician''', '''family doctor''', or formerly '''family practitioner'''. It is a division of [[primary care]] that provides continuing and comprehensive health care for the individual and family across all ages, genders, [[disease]]s, and parts of the body.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theabfm.org/about/policy.aspx | title = Definitions and Policies | work = American Board of Family Medicine | accessdate = 30 June 2009}}</ref> It is based on knowledge of the patient in the context of the family and the community, emphasizing [[disease prevention]] and [[health promotion]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/aboutus/specialty/definitions.html | title = Definitions, What is Family Medicine? | work = American Academy of Family Physicians | accessdate = 17 July 2009}}</ref> According to the [[World Organization of Family Doctors]] (Wonca), the aim of family medicine is to provide personal, comprehensive and continuing care for the individual in the context of the family and the community.<ref>http://www.globalfamilydoctor.com/aboutWonca/aboutwonca.asp?refurl=aw</ref> The issues of values underlying this practice are usually known as [[primary care ethics]]. In Europe the discipline is often referred to as [[general practice]], emphasising its holistic nature rather as well as its roots in the family. Others refer to it as the classic GP, knowledgeable yet compassionate.

==Scope of practice==
Family physicians in the United States may hold either an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] or a [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]] degree. Physicians who specialize in family medicine must successfully complete an accredited three-year family medicine [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in the United States in addition to their medical degree.  They are then eligible to sit for a [[board certification]] examination, which is now required by most hospitals and health plans.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001939.htm "Choosing a Primary Care Provider"], ''Medline Plus Medical Encyclopedia''.  Retrieved 6-30-09.</ref>  The [[American Board of Family Medicine]] requires its Diplomates to maintain certification through an ongoing process of [[continuing medical education]], medical knowledge review, patient care oversight through chart audits, practice-based learning through quality improvement projects and retaking the board certification examination every 7 to 10 years. The [[American Osteopathic Board of Family Physicians]] requires its Diplomates to maintain certification and undergo the process of recertification every 8 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Certificates/Longevity|url=http://www.aobfp.org/cert-long/index.html|publisher=AOBFP|accessdate=25 August 2012}}</ref>

Physicians certified in family medicine in [[Canada]] are certified through the College of Family Physicians of Canada,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfpc.ca/Principles/ |title=Principles &#124; About CFPC &#124; The College of Family Physicians Canada |publisher=Cfpc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref> after two years of additional education. Continuing education is also a requirement for continued certification.

The term "family medicine" is used in many European and Asian countries, instead of "general medicine" or "[[General practitioner|general practice]]". In [[Sweden]], certification in family medicine requires five years working with a tutor, after the medical degree. In [[India]], those who want to specialize in family medicine must complete a three-year family medicine residency, after their medical degree (MBBS). They are awarded either a D.N.B. or an M.D. in family medicine. Similar systems exist in other countries.

Family physicians deliver a range of acute, chronic and preventive medical care services. In addition to diagnosing and treating illness, they also provide preventive care, including routine checkups, health-risk assessments, immunization and screening tests, and personalized counseling on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Family physicians also manage chronic illness, often coordinating care provided by other subspecialists.<ref>[http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/policy/policies/f/scopephil.html "Family Medicine, Scope and Philosophical Statement"], American Academy of Family Physicians.

Family medicine and family physicians play a very important role in the healthcare system of a country. In the U.S., for example, nearly one in four of all office visits are made to family physicians. That is 208 million office visits each year — nearly 83 million more than the next largest medical specialty. Today, family physicians provide more care for America’s underserved and rural populations than any other medical specialty.<ref name="Facts About Family Medicine">[http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/aboutus/specialty/facts.html "Facts About Family Medicine"], ''American Academy of Family Physicians''.

== Family Medicine in the United States ==
===History===
Following [[World War II]], two events shaped the advent of family medicine.  First, medical specialties and subspecialties increased in popularity, having an adverse effect on the number of physicians in general practice.  At the same time, many medical advances were being made and there was concern within the "[[general practitioner]]" or "GP" population that four years of medical school plus a one-year internship was no longer adequate preparation for the breadth of medical knowledge required of the profession.<ref name="Pisacano, Nicholas J">{{cite web|url=https://www.theabfm.org/about/history.aspx|title=History of the Specialty|publisher=[[American Board of Family Medicine]]|author= Pisacano, Nicholas J.|accessdate=2009-06-30}}</ref>  Many of these doctors wanted to see a residency program added to their training; this would not only give them additional training, knowledge, and prestige, but would allow for board certification, which was increasingly required to gain hospital privileges.<ref name="Pisacano, Nicholas J"/>  In 1969, family medicine (then known as family practice) was recognized as a distinct specialty in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabfm.org/about/history.aspx|title=History of the Specialty|publisher=[[American Board of Family Medicine]]|author= Pisacano, Nicholas J.|accessdate=2007-08-08}}</ref>

===Education and training===
Family physicians complete an undergraduate degree, [[Medical school in the United States|medical school]], and three more years of specialized [[medical residency]] training in family medicine.<ref>Adams, Bob. Primary Care. ''CQ Researcher'', 5 (10), March 17, 1995.</ref> Their residency training includes rotations in [[internal medicine]], [[pediatrics]], [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrics-gynecology]], [[psychiatry]], and [[geriatrics]].<ref>[https://www.theabfm.org/about/abfmbrochure.aspx "Patient Brochure"], American Board of Family Medicine.

Many family physicians deliver babies in addition to taking care of patients of all ages.

In order to become [[Board certification|board certified]], family physicians must complete a residency in family medicine, possess a full and unrestricted medical license, and take a written cognitive examination.<ref>[https://www.theabfm.org/cert/certificationpolicies.aspx "Certification Policies"], American Board of Family Medicine.  Retrieved 6-30-09.</ref>  Between 2003 and 2009, the process for maintenance of board certification in family medicine is being changed (as well as all other [[American Board of Medical Specialties|American Specialty Boards]]) to a series of yearly tests on differing areas.  The [[American Board of Family Medicine]], as well as other specialty boards, are requiring additional participation in continuous learning and self-assessment to enhance clinical knowledge, expertise and skills.  The Board has created a program called the "Maintenance of Certification Program for Family Physicians" (MC-FP) which will require family physicians to continuously demonstrate proficiency in four areas of clinical practice: professionalism, self-assessment/lifelong learning, cognitive expertise, and performance in practice.  Three hundred hours of [[continuing medical education]] within the prior six years is also required to be eligible to sit for the exam.<ref>[https://www.theabfm.org/moc/index.aspx "Maintenance of Certification for Family Physicians (MC-FP)"], American Board of Family Medicine.

===Shortage of family physicians===
While many sources cite a shortage of family physicians (and also other primary care providers, i.e. internists, pediatricians, and general practitioners),<ref>{{cite news|last=Halsey|first=Ashley|title=Primary-Care Doctor Shortage May Undermine Health Reform Efforts|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/19/AR2009061903583.html|accessdate=12 November 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 20, 2009}}</ref> the per capita supply of primary care physicians has actually increased about 1 percent per year since 1998.<ref name="gao.gov">{{cite web|title=Recent Supply Trends, Projections, and Valuation of Services|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08472t.pdf|work=Testimony Before the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, U.S. Senate|publisher=United States Government Accountability Office|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref>  Additionally, a recent decrease in the number of M.D. graduates pursuing a residency in primary care, has been offset by the number of [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O. graduates]] and [[International medical graduate|graduates of international medical schools (IMGs)]] who enter primary care residencies.<ref name="gao.gov"/>  Still, projections indicate that by 2020 the demand for family physicians will exceed their supply.<ref name="gao.gov"/>

The number of students entering family medicine residency training has fallen from a high of 3,293 in 1998 to 1,172 in 2008, according to National Residency Matching Program data. Fifty-five family medicine residency programs have closed since 2000, while only 28 programs have opened.<ref>[http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/residents/match/summary.html "2009 Match Summary and Analysis"], ''American Academy of Family Physicians''.  Retrieved 7-17-09.</ref>

In 2006, when the nation had 100,431 family physicians, a workforce report by the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] indicated the United States would need 139,531 family physicians by 2020 to meet the need for primary medical care. To reach that figure 4,439 family physicians must complete their residencies each year, but currently the nation is attracting only half the number of future family physicians that we will need.<ref>[http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/policy/policies/w/workforce.html "Family Physician Workforce Reform"], ''American Academy of Family Physicians''.  Retrieved 7-17-09.</ref>

The waning interest in family medicine is likely due to several factors, including the lesser prestige associated with the specialty, the lesser pay, and the increasingly frustrating practice environment in the U.S.  Salaries for family physicians in the United States are respectable, but lower than average for physicians, with the average being $140,693<ref name = "Payscale">{{cite web|url=http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Industry=Family_Medicine/Salary |title=Family Medicine Industry Salary, Average Salaries |publisher=PayScale |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref> and ranging from $110,000 to $204,000,<ref>[http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20080714/REG/603020961 "2008 Physician compensation survey"], ''Modern Healthcare''. July 14, 2008. Retrieved 6-30-09.</ref> but when faced with debt from medical school, most medical students are opting for the higher paying specialties.  Potential ways to increase the number of medical students entering family practice include providing relief from medical education debt through loan-repayment programs and restructuring fee-for-service reimbursement for health care services.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bodenheimer|first=T|coauthors=Grumbach, K; Berenson, RA|title=A lifeline for primary care.|journal=The New England journal of medicine|date=2009 Jun 25|volume=360|issue=26|pages=2693–6|pmid=19553643}}</ref> Family physicians are trained to manage acute and chronic health issues for an individual simultaneously, yet their appointment slots may average only ten minutes.<ref>Stange, K., Zyzanski, S.

===Current practice===
Most family physicians in the US practice in solo or small-group private practices or as hospital employees in practices of similar sizes owned by hospitals. However, the specialty is broad and allows for a variety of career options including education, emergency medicine or urgent care, inpatient medicine, international or wilderness medicine, public health, sports medicine, and research.<ref>[http://fmignet.aafp.org/online/fmig/index/family-medicine/practice-options.html "Practice Options"], Family Medicine Interest Group.

== Family medicine in India ==
Family Medicine (FM) came to be recognized as a [[medical specialty]] in India only in the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Abraham|first=Sunil|title=Practicing and Teaching Family Medicine in India|url=http://www.stfm.org/fmhub/fm2007/October/Sunil671.pdf|publisher=Society of Teachers of Family Medicine|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref>  According to the National Health Policy - 2002, there is an acute shortage of specialists in family medicine.<ref>National Health Policy – 2002, section 4.9.</ref><ref>[http://www.mohfw.nic.in/np2002.htm ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref> As family physicians play very important role in providing affordable and universal health care to people, the Government of India is now promoting the practice of family medicine. Poverty and lawlessness exacerbate this shortage.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Although family medicine is sometimes called [[general practice]], they are not identical in India. A medical graduate who has successfully completed the [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS) course and has been registered with Indian Medical Council or any state medical council is considered a [[general practitioner]]. A family physician, however, is a [[primary care physician]] who has completed specialist training in the discipline of family medicine.

The [[Medical Council of India]] requires three-year residency for family medicine specialty, leading to the award of [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD) in Family Medicine or [[Diplomate of National Board]] (DNB) in Family Medicine.

The [[National Board of Examinations]] conducts family medicine residency programmes at the teaching hospitals that it accredits. On successful completion of a three-year residency, candidates are awarded Diplomate of National Board (Family Medicine).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.natboard.edu.in/index.php |title=Welcome To National Board Of Examination |publisher=Natboard.edu.in |date=2012-10-17 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref> The curriculum of DNB (FM) comprises: (1) medicine and allied sciences; (2) surgery and allied sciences; (3) maternal and child health; (4) basic sciences and community health. During their three-year residency, candidates receive integrated inpatient and outpatient learning. They also receive field training at community health centres and clinics.<ref>Bulletin of Information for Diplomate of National Board in Family Medicine (New Rules)</ref>

The Medical Council of India permits accredited medical colleges (medical schools) to conduct a similar residency programme in family medicine. On successful completion of three-year residency, candidates are awarded Doctor of Medicine (Family Medicine).<ref>Minimum Qualifications for Teachers in Medical Institutions Regulations - 1998, table 1.</ref><ref>Postgraduate Medical Education Regulations 2000, schedule A.</ref>  However, medical colleges are yet to start this MD (FM) course, even though there is an acute shortage of qualified family physicians in India.

The [[Indian Medical Association]]’s College of General Practitioners, offers a one-year Diploma in Family Medicine (DFM), a distance education programme of the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka, for doctors with minimum five years of experience in [[general practice]].<ref>[http://www.imacgpindia.org/pdf/DFM_Brochure1.pdf ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.imampstate.com/publications/News_from_CGP_HQ.pdf ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref> Since the Medical Council of India requires three-year residency for family medicine specialty, these diplomas are not recognized qualifications in India.

As India’s need for primary and secondary levels of health care is enormous, medical educators have called for systemic changes to include family medicine in the undergraduate medical curriculum.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zachariah|first=P|title=Rethinking medical education in India|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article17142.ece|accessdate=12 November 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=September 9, 2009}}</ref>

Recently, the residency-trained family physicians have formed the "Academy of Family Physicians of India" (AFPI)<ref name=AFPI>www.afpionline.com</ref> AFPI is the academic association of family physicians with formal full-time residency training (DNB Family Medicine) in Family Medicine. Currently there are about two hundred family medicine residency training sites accredited by the National Board of Examination India, providing around 700 training posts annually. However, there are various issues like academic acceptance, accreditation, curriculum development, uniform training standards, faculty development, research in primary care, ''etc.'' in need of urgent attention for family medicine to flourish as an academic specialty in India. The government of India has declared Family Medicine as focus area of human resource development in health sector in the National Health Policy 2002 <http://mohfw.nic.in/np2002.htm>. There is discussion ongoing to employ multi-skilled doctors with DNB family medicine qualification against specialist posts in NRHM (National Rural Health Mission).<ref name=AFPI />

Three possible models of how family physicians will practise their specialty in India might evolve, namely (1) private practice, (2) practising at primary care clinics/hospitals, (3) practising as consultants at secondary/tertiary care hospitals.
