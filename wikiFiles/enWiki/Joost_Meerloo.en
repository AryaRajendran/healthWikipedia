'''Joost Abraham Maurits Meerloo''' (March 14, 1903 – November 17, 1976) was a Dutch [[Doctor of Medicine]] and [[psychoanalyst]].

Born as '''Abraham Maurits 'Bram' Meerloo''' in [[The Hague, Netherlands]], he came to United States in 1946, was naturalized in 1950, and resumed Dutch citizenship in 1972. Dr. Meerloo was a practicing [[psychiatrist]] for over forty years. He did staff psychiatric work in [[Netherlands|Holland]] and worked as a general practitioner until 1942 under [[Nazi]] [[Military occupation|occupation]], when he assumed the name '''Joost''' to fool the occupying forces and in 1942 fled to England (after barely eluding death at the hands of the Germans). He was chief of the Psychological Department of the [[Dutch Army]]-in-Exile in England.

After the war he served as High Commissioner for Welfare in [[Netherlands|Holland]], and was an advisor to [[UNRRA]] and [[SHAEF]]. An American [[citizen]] since 1950, Dr. Meerloo was a member of the faculty at [[Columbia University]] and Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the [[New York School of Psychiatry]]. He was the author of many books, including [http://www.lermanet.com/scientology/mc-ch1.html ''Rape of the Mind''], the classic work on [[brainwashing]], ''Conversation and Communication'', and ''Hidden Communion''.

He was the son of Bernard and Anna Frederika (Benjamins) Meerloo. He married Elisabeth Johanna Kalf(f), Den Haag, May 16, 1928, divorce Februari 19, 1946. He married Louisa Betty 'Loekie' Duits (a [[physical therapist]]), New York, May 7, 1948.

Education: [[University of Leiden]], M.D., 1927; [[University of Utrecht]], Ph.D., 1932.

Meerloo specialized in the area of [[thought control]] techniques used by [[totalitarian]] regimes.

==Quotes==

"This is the lesson we have to learn, that of the two types of courage, that which consists in living is greater than that which aims at dying. We have to learn that sacrifice of one's life, though it may be a necessary means to an end, is not an end in itself. As a free people, we must choose the affirmative courage of life, not the negative sacrifice of death." – ''Total War and the Human Mind'', 1944.

"And yet one day men will have to grow up. Compared with the long ages of human existence on earth, our civilization is in its infancy. Sooner or later we must be ready to leave the dreamland of childhood, where imagination finds unlimited scope, and take our place in a world of limited freedoms. That world however, can in the long run give us something better than any vision conjured up in childhood." – ''Total War and the Human Mind'', 1944.
