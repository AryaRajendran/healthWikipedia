'''Transdermal Continuous Oxygen Therapy''' (TCOT, also known as '''Transdermal Continuous Oxygen Wound Therapy''') is a [[wound]] closure technique for [[chronic wound|chronic]] and acute wounds which blankets a wound in [[oxygen]] on a 24 hour basis until the wound heals. Unlike [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy|hyperbaric oxygen treatment]] for [[chronic wound]]s, oxygen treatment used in this therapy is not systemic in nature and treats only the wound area.  This treatment differs from topical oxygen treatments, as topical oxygen typically involves sporadic treatments of 1–3 hours several times per week, while TCOT treatment is 24/7 by nature.

==Overview==
Though early use focused on [[burn]]s and [[surgical wound]]s,<ref name="emulsion">{{cite journal |author= Davis S, Cazzaniga A, Ricotti C, Zalesky P, Hsu L, Creech J, Eaglstein W, Mertz P |title=[Topical Oxygen Emulsion] |language=|journal= Arch Dermatol |volume=143 |issue=10 |pages=1252–6 |year=2007 |pmid= 17938338|doi= 10.1001/archderm.143.10.1252|url= http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/143/10/1252 }}</ref> wider use of wounds treated with TCOT have become more common in [[Diabetic foot|diabetic foot]] ulcers, [[venous stasis]] and [[decubitus ulcer]]s(pressure sores).  TCOT involves inserting a thin tube which delivers the oxygen above the wound bed of a cleaned wound.  An absorbent dressing is then placed above the tube and an occlusive or semi occlusive dressing is placed over the entire wound site.  The far end of the tube is connected to an oxygen delivery unit, often portable, which delivers oxygen at a slow rate, typically 3ml per hour.

==Indications==

Although the FDA has approved treatment for at least one company using TCOT for the following indications,<ref name="indications">{{cite journal |author= |title=[FDA 510K Premarket Notification] |language=|journal= |volume= |issue= |pages=|year=2003 |pmid= |doi= |url= http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/pmn.cfm?ID=9767}}</ref> most of the interest in TCOT at present concerns diabetic foot ulcers, venous stasis, and decubitus ulcers.

•	[[Skin ulcer]]s due to [[diabetes]]<br />
•	[[Skin ulcer]]s due to [[venous stasis]]<br />
•	[[Decubitus ulcer]]s (bed sores, [[Bedsore|pressure sores]])<br />
•	[[Skin ulcers]] due to [[post-surgical infections]]<br />
•	Lesions due to [[gangrene]]<br />
•	[[Skin grafts]]<br />
•	[[Burn]]s<br />
•	[[Frostbite]]

==Effectiveness==

Animal studies conducted in 2004-2005 have demonstrated the effectiveness of TCOT on Rabbit ear wounds.<ref name="rabbit">{{cite journal |author= Said H, Hijjawi J, Roy N, Mogford J, Mustoe T|title=[ Transdermal Sustained Delivery Oxygen Improves Epithelial Healing in a Rabbit Ear Wound Model] |language=|journal= Arch Surg |volume=140 |issue= 10|pages=998–1004|year=2005|pmid= 16230552|doi= 10.1001/archsurg.140.10.998|url= http://archsurg.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/140/10/998}}</ref>   A recently published study documented two prevented amputations which have shown TCOT to be highly effective on diabetic foot ulcers, venous stasis and decubitus ulcers<ref name="transdermal">{{cite journal |author= Hirsh F, Berlin S, Holtz A|title=[Transdermal Oxygen Delivery to Diabetic Wounds: A Report of 6 Cases] |journal= Adv Skin Wound Care |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=20–24 |year=2009 |pmid= 19096280|doi= 10.1097/01.ASW.0000343722.22943.40|url= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Hirsh+Fred%5bau%5d}}</ref> and a study completed in 2010 by Dr. Gary Sibbald documented the effectiveness of TCOT on 9 diabetic foot ulcer patients.<ref name="sibbald">{{cite journal |author= Woo K, Sibbald G, Coutts P |title=[Pilot Study to Evaluate the use of Continuous Topical Oxygen Therapy in the Treatment of Chronic Wounds] |language=|journal= European Wound Management Association |year=2011|url= http://ewma.org/fileadmin/user_upload/EWMA/pdf/conference_abstracts/2010/Poster/EWMA2010_P%2034.pdf}}</ref>  Manufacturers of devices used in TCOT have published several additional cases whereby treatment using TCOT prevented previously scheduled amputations.<ref name="TCOT">{{cite journal |author=|title=[Case Studies of Wounds Treated with TCOT] |language=|journal= |volume= |issue= |pages=|year=|pmid= |doi= |url= http://ogenix.com/home/page/casestudies |date=March 2011}}</ref>
