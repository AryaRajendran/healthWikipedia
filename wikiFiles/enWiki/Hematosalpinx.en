'''Hematosalpinx''' (sometimes also hemosalpinx) is a medical condition involving bleeding into the [[fallopian tubes]].   
==Causes==
A number of causes may account for a hematosalpinx, by far the most common being a [[tubal pregnancy]]. Blood may also escape into the peritoneal cavity leading to a [[hemoperitoneum]].
A hematosalpinx can also be associated with [[endometriosis]] or [[tubal carcinoma]]. Further, if menstrual blood flow is obstructed ([[cryptomenorrhea]]),caused for instance by a [[Vaginal septum#Transverse septum|transverse vaginal septum]], and gets backed up it may lead to a hematosalpinx.

==Symptoms==
A hematosalpinx from a tubal pregnancy may be associated with pelvic pain and uterine bleeding. A [[gynecologic ultrasound]] will show the hematosalpinx. A hematosalpinx from other conditions may be painless but could lead to uterine bleeding.
==Treatment==
Treatment is directed at the underlying condition and usually surgical.
