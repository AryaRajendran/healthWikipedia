'''Whole genome sequencing''', (also known as '''full genome sequencing''', '''complete genome sequencing''', or '''entire genome sequencing'''), is a laboratory process that determines the complete [[DNA]] sequence of an organism's [[genome]] at a single time.  This entails sequencing all of an organism's [[chromosomal]] DNA  as well as DNA contained in the [[mitochondrial DNA|mitochondria]] and, for plants, in the [[chloroplast]]. Almost any biological sample containing a full copy of the DNA—even a very small amount of DNA or [[ancient DNA]]—can provide the genetic material necessary for full genome sequencing. Such samples may include [[saliva]], [[epithelial cells]], [[bone marrow]], [[hair]] (as long as the hair contains a [[hair follicle]]), [[seed]]s, plant leaves, or anything else that has DNA-containing cells.  Because the sequence data that is produced can be quite large (for example, there are approximately six billion [[base pair]]s in each human diploid genome), genomic data is stored electronically and requires a large amount of computing power and storage capacity.  Full genome sequencing would have been nearly impossible before the advent of the [[microprocessor]], [[computers]], and the [[Information Age]].

Unlike full genome sequencing, [[DNA profiling]] only determines the likelihood that genetic material came from a particular individual or group; it does not contain additional information on genetic relationships, origin or susceptibility to specific diseases.<ref>Kijk magazine, 01 January 2009</ref>  Also unlike full genome sequencing, [[SNP genotyping]] covers less than 0.1% of the genome.  Almost all truly complete genomes are of microbes; the term "full genome" is thus sometimes used loosely to mean "greater than 95%". The remainder of this article focuses on nearly complete human genomes.

In general, knowing the complete DNA sequence of an individual's genome does not, on its own, provide useful clinical information, but this may change over time as a large number of scientific studies continue to be published detailing clear associations between specific genetic variants and disease.<ref name="pmid17554300">{{cite journal | title = Genome-wide association study of 14,000 cases of seven common diseases and 3,000 shared controls | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7145 | pages = 661–78 | year = 2007 | month = June | pmid = 17554300 | doi = 10.1038/nature05911 | author1 = Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium | pmc = 2719288 | last2 = Clayton | first2 = David G. | last3 = Cardon | first3 = Lon R. | last4 = Craddock | first4 = Nick | last5 = Deloukas | first5 = Panos | last6 = Duncanson | first6 = Audrey | last7 = Kwiatkowski | first7 = Dominic P. | last8 = McCarthy | first8 = Mark I. | last9 = Ouwehand | first9 = Willem H. |bibcode = 2007Natur.447..661B }}</ref><ref name="pmid17898773">{{cite journal | author = Mailman MD, Feolo M, Jin Y, Kimura M, Tryka K, Bagoutdinov R, Hao L, Kiang A, Paschall J, Phan L, Popova N, Pretel S, Ziyabari L, Lee M, Shao Y, Wang ZY, Sirotkin K, Ward M, Kholodov M, Zbicz K, Beck J, Kimelman M, Shevelev S, Preuss D, Yaschenko E, Graeff A, Ostell J, Sherry ST | title = The NCBI dbGaP database of genotypes and phenotypes | journal = Nat.

==Early Techniques==

[[Image:ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer 3.jpg|right|thumbnail|An ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer. Such capillary sequencers automated the early efforts of sequencing genomes.]]
Sequencing of nearly an entire human genome was first accomplished in 2000 partly through the use of [[shotgun sequencing]] technology.  While full genome shotgun sequencing for small (4000–7000 [[base pair]]) genomes was already in use in 1979,<ref name="pmid461197">{{cite journal | author = Staden R | title = A strategy of DNA sequencing employing computer programs | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = 2601–10 | year = 1979 | month = June | pmid = 461197 | pmc = 327874 | doi = 10.1093/nar/6.7.2601| url = http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=461197 }}</ref> broader application benefited from pairwise end sequencing, known colloquially as ''double-barrel shotgun sequencing''.  As sequencing projects began to take on longer and more complicated genomes, multiple groups began to realize that useful information could be obtained by sequencing both ends of a fragment of DNA. Although sequencing both ends of the same fragment and keeping track of the paired data was more cumbersome than sequencing a single end of two distinct fragments, the knowledge that the two sequences were oriented in opposite directions and were about the length of a fragment apart from each other was valuable in reconstructing the sequence of the original target fragment.

The first published description of the use of paired ends was in 1990 as part of the sequencing of the human [[Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase|HPRT]] locus,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Edwards | first = A

The first theoretical description of a pure pairwise end sequencing strategy, assuming fragments of constant length, was in 1991.<ref name="pmid2341149">{{cite journal | author = Edwards A, Voss H, Rice P, Civitello A, Stegemann J, Schwager C, Zimmermann J, Erfle H, Caskey CT, Ansorge W | title = Automated DNA sequencing of the human HPRT locus | journal = Genomics | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 593–608 | year = 1990 | month = April | pmid = 2341149 | doi = 10.1016/0888-7543(90)90493-E}}</ref>  In 1995 Roach et al. introduced the innovation of using fragments of varying sizes,<ref name="pmid7601461">{{cite journal | author = Roach JC, Boysen C, Wang K, Hood L | title = Pairwise end sequencing: a unified approach to genomic mapping and sequencing | journal = Genomics | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 345–53 | year = 1995 | month = March | pmid = 7601461 | doi = 10.1016/0888-7543(95)80219-C }}</ref> and demonstrated that a pure pairwise end-sequencing strategy would be possible on large targets. The strategy was subsequently adopted by [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] (TIGR) to sequence the entire genome of the bacterium ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' in 1995,<ref name="pmid7542800">{{cite journal | author = Fleischmann RD, Adams MD, White O, Clayton RA, Kirkness EF, Kerlavage AR, Bult CJ, Tomb JF, Dougherty BA, Merrick JM | title = Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae Rd | journal = Science | volume = 269 | issue = 5223 | pages = 496–512 | year = 1995 | month = July | pmid = 7542800 | doi = 10.1126/science.7542800 |bibcode = 1995Sci...269..496F }}</ref> and then by [[Celera Genomics]] to sequence the entire fruit fly genome in 2000,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Adams | first = MD | coauthors = et al.   | title = The genome sequence of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Science | volume = 287 | issue = 5461 | pages = 2185–95 | year = 2000| pmid = 10731132   | doi = 10.1126/science.287.5461.2185 | bibcode=2000Sci...287.2185.}}</ref> and subsequently the entire human genome.  [[Applied Biosystems]], now called [[Life Technologies]], manufactured the automated capillary sequencers utilized by both Celera Genomics and The Human Genome Project.

While capillary sequencing was the first approach to successfully sequence a nearly full human genome, it is still too expensive and takes too long for commercial purposes.  Because of this, shotgun sequencing technology, even though it is still relatively 'new', since 2005 is being displaced by technologies like [[pyrosequencing]], SMRT sequencing, and nanopore technology.<ref name="pmid19193124">{{cite journal | author = Mukhopadhyay R | title = DNA sequencers: the next generation | journal = Anal.

===2009===

'''In early February 2009''', Complete Genomics released a full sequence of a human genome that was sequenced using their service.  The data indicates that Complete Genomics' full genome sequencing service accuracy is just under 99.999%, meaning that just one in every one hundred thousand variants was called incorrectly. This means that their full sequence of the human genome will contain  approximately 80,000–100,000 [[false positive]] errors in each genome.  However, this accuracy rate was based on Complete Genomics' sequence that was completed utilizing a 90× depth of coverage (each base in the genome was sequenced 90 times) while their commercialized sequence is reported to be only 40×.

==Societal impact==
{{Further|Personal genomics}}

Inexpensive, time-efficient full genome sequencing will be a major accomplishment not only for the field of [[genomics]], but for the entire human [[civilization]] because, for the first time, individuals will be able to have their entire genome sequenced.  Utilizing this information, it is speculated that health care professionals, such as physicians and [[genetic counselors]], will eventually be able to use genomic information to predict what diseases a person may get in the future and attempt to either minimize the impact of that disease or avoid it altogether through the implementation of personalized, [[preventive medicine]].  Full genome sequencing will allow [[health care professionals]] to analyze the entire human genome of an individual and therefore detect all disease-related genetic variants, regardless of the genetic variant's prevalence or frequency.  This will enable the rapidly emerging medical fields of [[Predictive Medicine]] and [[Personalized Medicine]] and will mark a significant leap forward for the clinical genetic revolution.  Full genome sequencing is clearly of great importance for research into the basis of genetic disease and has shown significant benefit to a subset of individuals with rare disease in the clinical setting.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ng SB, Buckingham KJ, Lee C, ''et al.'' |title=Exome sequencing identifies the cause of a mendelian disorder |journal=Nat.

Today, parents have the legal authority to obtain testing of any kind for their children.{{Where|date=July 2012}} Currently available [[newborn screening]] for childhood diseases allows detection of rare disorders that can be prevented or better treated by early detection and intervention. Specific [[genetic testing|genetic tests]] are also available to determine an etiology when a child's symptoms appear to have a genetic basis.  Full genome sequencing, in addition has the potential to reveal a large amount of information (such as [[genetic carrier|carrier status]] for [[autosomal recessive]] disorders, genetic risk factors for [[polygenic inheritance|complex]] adult-onset diseases, and other predictive medical and non-medical information) that is currently not completely understood, may not be clinically useful to the child during childhood, and may not necessarily be wanted by the individual upon reaching adulthood.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mayer AN, Dimmock DP, Arca MJ, ''et al.'' |title=A timely arrival for genomic medicine |journal=Genet.
