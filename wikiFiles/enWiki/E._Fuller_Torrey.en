'''Edwin Fuller Torrey''', M.D. (born September 6, 1937, [[Utica, New York|Utica]], [[New York]]), is an [[United States|American]] [[psychiatrist]] and [[schizophrenia]] researcher.  He is executive director of the [[Stanley Medical Research Institute]] (SMRI) and founder of the [[Treatment Advocacy Center]] (TAC), a nonprofit organization with the goals of eliminating legal and clinical obstacles to the treatment of severe mental illness.<ref>{{cite web

Dr. Torrey has conducted numerous research studies, particularly on possible infectious causes of schizophrenia. He has become well known as an advocate of the idea that severe mental illness is due to biological factors and not social factors.<ref>Princeton Alumni News, 11/5/2003</ref> He has appeared on national radio and television outlets and written for many newspapers. He has received two Commendation Medals by the U.S. Public Health Service and numerous other awards and tributes. He has been criticized by a range of people, including federal researchers and others for some of his attacks on de-institutionalization and his support for forced medication as a method of treatment.<ref name="Nugent2003">{{cite web

Torrey is on the board of the Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC), which describes itself as being "a national [[nonprofit]] [[advocacy]] organization. [http://www.psychlaws.org]  TAC supports [[involuntary treatment]] when deemed appropriate by a judge (at the urging of the person's psychiatrist and family members). Torrey has written several best-selling books on [[mental illness]], including ''Surviving Schizophrenia''.

==Education and early career==
Torrey earned his bachelor's degree, ''[[magna cum laude]]'', from [[Princeton University]], and his [[medical doctor]]'s degree from the [[McGill University]] School of Medicine. Torrey also earned a master's degree in [[anthropology]] from [[Stanford University]], and was trained in psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine.  At McGill and later at Stanford, he was exposed to a biological approach and recalls that one of his first-year instructors at McGill was [[Heinz Lehmann]], the first clinician in North America to use the first antipsychotic, [[chlorpromazine]]. The medical school was housed next door to the [[Montreal Neurological Institute]], a premier neuroscience center.<ref name="Moran2007"/> 

Torrey then practiced general medicine in [[Ethiopia]] for two years as a [[Peace Corps]] physician and in the South [[Bronx]]. From 1970 to 1975, he was a special administrative assistant to the NIMH director. He then worked for year in [[Alaska]] in the Indian Health Service. He then became a ward physician at [[St. Elizabethâ€™s Hospital]] for the mentally ill in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name="Nugent2003"/> for nine years, where he reportedly worked with the most challenging patients and aimed to avoid the use of seclusion or restraints on the acute admission units.<ref name="Moran2007"/> He also volunteered at Washington homeless clinics.<ref name="Winerip1998"/>

==Stanley Medical Research Institute==
Torrey is the founder and Executive Director of the Stanley Medical Research Institute (SMRI), a large, private provider of research on schizophrenia and [[bipolar disorder]] in the US. SMRI also maintains a collection of postmortem [[brain]] tissue from individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major [[clinical depression|depression]] and from unaffected controls, which are made available to researchers without charge. 

After reading Torrey's book "Surviving Schizophrenia," [[Theodore Stanley]], a businessman who had made a fortune in direct-mail marketing and whose son had been diagnosed in the late 1980s with bipolar disorder, contacted Torrey and he and his wife provided the funds for the new institute.[http://pressherald.mainetoday.com/specialrpts/braindonors/041017torrey.shtml]

As of 2004 the Stanley Institute had 30 employees and funded half of all U.S. research on bipolar disorder and about a quarter of all schizophrenia research. In 2003 the institute's rapidly growing research budget exceeded $40 million, 74 percent of which was given out to other researchers through grants.[http://pressherald.mainetoday.com/specialrpts/braindonors/041017torrey.shtml] It reports that 75% of its expenditure goes towards the development of new treatments.[http://www.stanleyresearch.org/dnn/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx]

The Stanley Medical Institute in Bethesda Maryland has collected in excess of 600 brains [http://www.stanleyresearch.org/dnn/Portals/0/Stanley/Introduction%20to%20the%20Stanley%20Brain%20Collection.pdf PDF] In ARCH GEN PSYCHIATRY/VOL 61, NOV 2004, in a report called, "Brain Anatomy in Adults With Velocardiofacial Syndrome With and Without Schizophrenia", SMRI published results of a Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study showing difference in brain structure of people with and without schizophrenia. 

The SMRI has been sued for allegedly taking brains for use in research without proper consent. One lawsuit was settled out of court.[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/29/AR2005062902923_pf.html][http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/case/organ_donation.html]

As of 2008 SMRI was also supporting the [[Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research]] at the Broad Institute, which plans to scan the entire genome for variants that predispose to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and screen hundreds of thousands of compounds against new molecular targets prior to clinical testing.[http://www.stanleyresearch.org/dnn/CenterforPsychiatricResearch/Overview/tabid/162/Default.aspx]

SMRI reports that it has a close relationship with and is the supporting organization for the [[Treatment Advocacy Center]] (TAC).[http://www.stanleyresearch.org/dnn/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx]

==Treatment Advocacy Center==
Torrey is a founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center, a national organization that supports [[outpatient commitment]] for certain people with mental illness who, in his view of their treatment history and present circumstances, are judged unlikely to survive safely in the community without supervision.  TAC has been credited by [[New York (state)|New York]] State Attorney General [[Eliot Spitzer]] and others with helping pass [[Kendra's Law]] in the state.  Kendra's Law allows court-ordered involuntary treatment of people diagnosed with schizophrenia or other severe mental illness who have a history of noncompliance with psychiatric advice, i.e., individuals who are, "as a result of his or her mental illness, unlikely to voluntarily participate in the recommended treatment pursuant to the treatment plan."[http://www.omh.ny.gov/omhweb/Kendra_web/Ksummary.htm]  Previously, only inpatient programs were available to submit a person to involuntary treatment.  TAC's efforts to pass Kendra's Law led to similar successful passage of [[Laura's Law]] in [[California]], and similar laws in [[Florida]] and elsewhere.  Torrey has testified numerous times in front of Congress.

==National Alliance on Mental Illness==
Torrey was for many years an active advisor for the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] (NAMI). Parents felt that he spoke up for them when much of the medical establishment had previously held that parenting was responsible for schizophrenia. Torrey helped build NAMI into a powerful political force through campaigning and donating the hardcover royalties from the sale of his book "Surviving Schizophrenia".<ref name="Winerip1998">Winerip, M. (1998) [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E6D9173FF931A15751C0A96E958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print Schizophrenia's Most Zealous Foe] New York Times, February 22</ref>

Although Torrey, TAC, and NAMI remain aligned, NAMI may have tried to distance itself from TAC in 1998. One source ''The Psychiatric Times'', reported that TAC was designed from the start to be "a separate support organization with its own source of funding."[http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/p980739.html] According to [[MindFreedom International]], an association of survivors of psychiatric treatment opposed to involuntary treatment, NAMI severed its relationship with TAC because of pressure from groups opposed to Torrey both from within NAMI and outside NAMI. Torrey is, according to MindFreedom, one of 'the most feverishly pro-force psychiatrists in the world'. MindFreedom suggests that the 'links between NAMI and TAC are simply going from overt to covert.'<!-- [http://www.mindfreedom.org/mindfreedom/ioc/workers.shtml] --> 

In 2002, NAMI's Executive Director issued a statement highly critical of [[60 Minutes]] for producing a piece entitled "Dr. Torrey's War."  In the statement, NAMI alternately criticized and backed various positions espoused by Torrey while aiming its criticism at 60 Minutes for what NAMI called "sound bite journalism."  [http://www.nami.org/Content/ContentGroups/E-News/20023/April_20022/NAMI_Condemns_CBS_s_60_Minutes__For__Sound_Bite_Journalism_.htm]. 

Torrey was also the keynote speaker at the 23rd annual NAMI convention in 2002. [http://www.psychlaws.org/PressRoom/documents/VitaeEFTNov2005.pdf].

In 2005, NAMI gave Dr. Torrey a tribute on its 25th Anniversary Celebratory Donor Wall, for those who have donated over $25,000. It called him a groundbreaking researcher, a ferociously resolute advocate, a prominent and admired author of dozens of books and a dedicated practicing clinician, and said that he had "touched the lives of countless NAMI members throughout this nation."[https://www.nami.org/customsource/donation/TorreyTribute.cfm]

NAMI has some continuing links to TAC via their board of directors. One individual, Frederick Frese, is presently on both the NAMI and TAC boards.  TAC has two other former NAMI board members on their board and Laurie Flynn, the former NAMI executive director, is part of the TAC Honorary Advisory Committee.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

In 2008, Torrey disagreed with a NAMI view on second-generation antipsychotics and accused the medical director and executive director of failing to disclose conflicts of interest, because they are employees of an organization that receives more than half its budget from pharmaceutical companies. He argued they were not representing the views of many members of NAMI including himself.<ref>Torrey, E.F. (2008) [http://psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/59/8/935 A Question of Disclosure] Psychiatr Serv 59:935, August 2008 {{doi|10.1176/appi.ps.59.8.935}}</ref>

==Scientific research and views==
In the 1950s, it was commonly thought that schizophrenia was caused by 'bad parenting'. Torrey has argued that this theory had a toxic effect on parents. His sister had severe schizophrenia and spent most of five decades in hospitals and nursing homes until her death.<ref name="Moran2007">Moran, M. (2007) [http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/42/13/17 Search for Schizophrenia's Roots Started at Home] Psychiatr News July 6, Volume 42, Number 13, page 17</ref>

Torrey has been a fierce opponent of the influence of [[Freud]] and [[psychoanalysis]]. He has also argued that [[psychiatry]] should focus only on severe mental illness, conceived as neurological disorders, rather than other mental issues that he viewed as non-medical.<ref name="Mihm2001">Mihm, S. (2001) [http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Schizovirus.html Pet Theory: Do Cats Cause Schizophrenia?] The New York Times Magazine on the Web</ref><ref>Stevens, L. [http://www.antipsychiatry.org/abolish.htm Why Psychiatry Should Be Abolished as a Medical Specialty] Retrieved on Aug-10-2008</ref>

Torrey was principal investigator of a [[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]] Schizophrenia/Bipolar Disorder Twin Study conducted at the Neuroscience center of St Elizabeth's Hospital in the late 1980s/early 1990s, and copublished more than a dozen studies on structural brain differences between affected and unaffected siblings.<ref name="Moran2007"/> He differed from his collaborators in arguing that the genetic [[heritability]] of schizophrenia was lower than typically estimated.<ref name="Mihm2001"/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Torrey | first1 = EF | title = Are we overestimating the genetic contribution to schizophrenia? | journal = Schizophrenia bulletin | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 159â€“70 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1621064 }}</ref> A review of Torrey's data analysis, however, suggested he had erroneously compared different sorts of concordance statistics.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McGue | first1 = M. | year = 1992 | title = When assessing twin concordance, use the probandwise not the pairwise rate | url = | journal = Schizophr Bull | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 171â€“6 | pmid = 1621065 }}</ref>

In the early 1970s, Torrey became interested in viral infections as possible causes of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, particularly a parasite ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' whose [[definitive host]] is the [[cat]], but whose [[intermediate host]] can be any mammal, including humans.<ref name="Mihm2001"/> Up to one third of the world's human population is estimated to carry a Toxoplasma infection.<ref name=Montoya_2004>{{cite journal |author=Montoya J, Liesenfeld O |title=Toxoplasmosis |journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9425 |pages=1965â€“76 |year=2004 |pmid=15194258 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16412-X}}</ref> Since then he has published, often with [[Robert Yolken]], more than 30 articles on seasonal variation and possible infectious causes of schizophrenia, focusing especially on Toxoplasma gondii. He is involved in five or six ongoing studies using anti-Toxoplasmosa gondii agents (e.g. antibiotics such as [[minocycline]] and [[azithromycin]][http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=8142504&dopt=Abstract][http://aac.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/41/10/2137]) as an add-on treatment for schizophrenia. He believes that infectious causes will eventually explain the "vast majority" of schizophrenia cases.<ref name="Moran2007"/> Some of his collaborators have disagreed with the emphasis he has placed on infection as a direct causal factor.<ref name="Mihm2001"/> Many of the research studies on links between schizophrenia and ''Toxoplasma gondii'', by different authors in different countries, are funded and supported by the Stanley Medical Research Institute. The hypothesis is not prominent in current mainstream scientific views on the [[causes of schizophrenia]], although infections may be seen as one possible risk factor that could lead to vulnerabilities in early neurodevelopment in some cases.

Torrey has generally been in favor of [[antipsychotic]] drugs. He has claimed that taking antipsychotics reduces the risk of violence, homelessness and prison. He has argued that "noncompliance" in about half of cases of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is due to lack of "insight" into the illness because the part of the brain for self-awareness has been affected; and that in some who are aware it is due to adverse effects ranging from tremors or sedation to sexual dysfunction to substantial weight gain.<ref name=Fuller1999reinvent>E. Fuller Torrey [http://www.city-journal.org/html/9_4_a5.html Reinventing Mental Health Care] City Journal, Autumn 1999</ref> He has also reported that at least some antipsychotics cause medical conditions in some people that can be fatal, especially [[African Americans]].[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/160/12/2241] He has also argued that pharmaceutical companies have too much influence over psychiatric organizations and psychiatrists, effectively buying them off.<ref>E. Fuller Torrey (2002) [http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_going_rate_on_shrinks The Going Rate on Shrinks: Big Pharma and the buying of psychiatry] The American Prospect, July 14.</ref>

Torrey has advocated in favor of a flexible well-funded range of [[community mental health services]], including [[Assertive Community Treatment]], [[Clubhouse Model of Psychosocial Rehabilitation|clubhouses]] (staffed by professionals with consumers as members), [[supported housing]] and [[supported employment]], emphasizing illness and medication compliance throughout.<ref name=Fuller1999reinvent/>

==Recognition==
Dr. Torrey has appeared on national radio and television (outlets like NPR, Oprah, 20/20, 60 Minutes, and Dateline) and has written for many newspapers. He has received a 1984 Special Families Award from NAMI, two Commendation Medals from the [[U.S. Public Health Service]], a 1991 National Caring Award, and a humanitarian award from [[NARSAD]] (now known as the [[Brain & Behavior Research Foundation]]). In 1999, he received a research award from the International Congress of Schizophrenia.  In 2005, a tribute to Torrey was included in NAMI's 25th Anniversary Celebratory Donor Wall.<ref>Treatment Advocacy Center [http://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/pressroom/Bio1.htm PRESIDENT, E. FULLER TORREY, M.D.] Retrieved on Aug-10-2008</ref>

==Criticism==

Torrey has criticized many organizations. He has charged the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] with not concentrating its resources sufficiently on severe mental illness and directly applicable research; NIMH has disputed his statistics and viewpoint.[http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/39/5/8-a] 

Torrey has been charged with acting to limit the voice of those [[Psychiatric survivors movement|consumers, survivors and ex-patients]] that he disagrees with, opposing their civil rights and censoring and ridiculing their ideas and those of their supporters. Torrey has been a long-time critic of the [[Center for Mental Health Services]] that provides support and advocacy, on the grounds that they support [[antipsychiatry]] groups and those opposed to [[outpatient commitment]], claiming they neglect the seriously mentally ill due to a hippie 60s attitude, distributing funds on the basis of other factors such as "community cohesion" and [[ethnic minority]] involvement, and being more dysfunctional than the individuals it is supposed to help.[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25288801_ITM] He has specifically opposed public funding for the [[National Empowerment Center]], for rejecting the [[medical model]] and arguing for a [[recovery model]] without necessarily needing medication; it has since lost its funding from the CMHS.[http://www.necwest.org/] Torrey has in general been instrumental in lobbying against, and undermining, community-based consumer projects because they promoted social and experiential recovery and questioned the standard medical model. Consumer organizations have protested that they are already economically disadvantaged and vulnerable to political whim while Torrey and his organizations have rich and powerful backers.<ref name="McLean2003part2">McLean, A.

Retrieved on Aug 12 2008</ref> Torrey hopes to live long enough to see [[vaccines]] to prevent many or most cases of schizophrenia.<ref name="Moran2007"/>

Although Torrey described family members as "surviving schizophrenia" in his book of that title, in 1997 he said the term "psychiatric survivor" used by ex-patients to describe themselves was just political correctness and he blamed them, along with civil rights lawyers, for the deaths of half a million people due to suicides and deaths on the street.<ref>E. Fuller Torrey (1997) [http://psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/issue_pdf/edboard_pdf/48/2.pdf Taking Issue: â€˜Psychiatric Survivorsâ€™ and Non-Survivors], 48:2 Psychiatric Services 143</ref> His comments elicited a record number of letters in response, some in favour of Torrey but most against.<ref name="Reaume2002"/> The accusations have been described as inflammatory and completely unsubstantiated, and issues of self-determination and self-identity said to be more complex than Torrey realizes.<ref name="Reaume2002">{{cite journal | last1 = Reaume | first1 = G | title = Lunatic to patient to person: nomenclature in psychiatric history and the influence of patients' activism in North America. | journal = International journal of law and psychiatry | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 405â€“26 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12613052 | doi=10.1016/S0160-2527(02)00130-9}}</ref> In the same journal in 1999, Torrey and Miller of the Stanley Foundation Research Program argued for an incentivised  schizophrenia treatment system backed by a credible threat of force, modelled on that used for the fatal infectious disease [[Tuberculosis]];<ref>E.

(2001) [http://psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/52/3/384 Schizophrenia Is Not Contagious] Psychiatr Serv 52:384, March 2001</ref><ref>[http://psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/51/3/393.pdf Letters to psychiatric services journal, March 2001]</ref> 

Torrey has been a vocal critic of the failures of [[deinstitutionalization]] and inadequate [[community mental health services]]. He has generally linked this to issues of violence, homelessness and medication noncompliance, as well as lack of proper focus by the relevant governmental organizations.<ref>Torrey, E.F. & Zdanowicz, M. (1998) [http://www.psychlaws.org/generalresources/Article2.htm Why deinstitutionalization turned deadly] The Wall Street Journal August 4</ref> He has been accused of gaining influence by sensationalizing and exaggerating the incidence of violence and its link to medication noncompliance, including disseminating unsubstantiated and unreliable statistics. When a California NAMI journal editor included a questioning of Torrey's statistics, the local board glued together the pages [http://www.namiscc.org/newsletters/March01/Sacramento-web.htm] and effectively shut down the journal.<ref name="McLean2003part2"/> Others, while agreeing that public mental health care in the U.S. falls far short of what people with serious psychiatric disorders need and deserve, have argued that Torrey's solutions are outdated and that his book The Insanity Offense is based on unsubtantiated portrayals of certainty on the statistics on violence, outpatient commitment and medication, stigmatizing tens of thousands of people, deeply offending and insulting those who hold views differing from his own, and promulgating one-dimensional solutions. TAC's attempts to associate violent incidents in the news with lack of medication have been described as wild [[hyperbole]], and the use of the term "assisted treatment" has been described as a [[euphemism]] for forced drugging.<ref>Richard Gosden and Sharon Beder, [http://www.herinst.org/sbeder/corppower/pharm-agenda.html Pharmaceutical Industry Agenda Setting in Mental Health Policies], Ethical Human Sciences and Services 3(3) Fall/Winter 2001, pp. 147-159.</ref>

Philip Dawdy has challenged it.
He wrote
"You might even ask him why his group cites violence done by people not taking medications, but ignores violent acts committed by people who were on medications and why so many of the studies the group cites are decades old"

and California Network of Mental Health Clients (CNMHC) has challenged it.
"Contrary to Treatment Advocacy Center's explicit claims, the study makes no mention of "untreated" mental illness, schizophrenia, manic depression, or any other diagnosis. Equally, there is no basis for extrapolating the 4.3% of the national population. TAC arbitrarily raised DOJ's homicide estimate from 4.3% to 5%. Then they arbitrarily attributed these homicides to less than 1% of the U.S. population, the number TAC says have "untreated schizophrenia and manic-depression."

In another error: 4.3% of 16,914 (the total homicides in 1998) is 727, not 1,000 as TAC claims. And DOJ's predictions for 1999 will lower the figure still further to 645."

Torrey has been criticized by, and has criticized, [[Thomas Szasz]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] psychiatrist and author of [[The Myth of Mental Illness]] who is opposed to involuntary treatment.<ref>Szasz T.(2004) [http://jhp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/44/4/416 Psychiatric Fraud and Force: A Critique of E.
