'''Cluttering''' (also called '''tachyphemia''') is a [[speech disorder|speech]] and [[communication disorder]] characterized by a rapid rate making speech difficult to understand, erratic rhythm, poor [[syntax]] or grammar, and words or groups of words unrelated to the sentence.  

==Classification==
Cluttering is a [[speech disorder|speech]] and [[communication disorder]] that has also been described as a [[fluency]] disorder.<ref>{{cite book

It is defined as:<blockquote>"Cluttering is a fluency disorder characterized by a rate that is perceived to be abnormally rapid, irregular, or both for the speaker (although measured syllable rates may not exceed normal limits). These rate abnormalities further are manifest in one or more of the following symptoms: (a) an excessive number of [[disfluencies]], the majority of which are not typical of people with [[stuttering]]; (b) the frequent placement of pauses and use of [[prosodic|prosodic patterns]] that do not conform to [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] constraints; and (c) inappropriate (usually excessive) degrees of [[coarticulation]] among sounds, especially in multisyllabic words".<ref>St. Louis, K. O., Myers, F. L., Bakker, K., & Raphael, L. J. (2007). Understanding and treating cluttering. In E. G. Conture & R. F. Curlee (Eds.) Stuttering and related disorders of fluency, 3rd ed. (pp. 297-325). NY: Thieme.</ref></blockquote>

==Characteristics==
[[Spoonerism]]s, [[malapropisms]], [[Colemanballs]], and [[Freudian slips]] are examples of cluttering.  [[Stuttering]] as a common term often refers to the speech disorder of cluttering, rather than to the speech disorder of stuttering.  [[Cluttered speech]] is exhibited by normal speakers, and is often referred to as stuttering—this is especially true when the speaker is nervous, where nervous speech more closely resembles cluttering than stuttering.

Cluttering is sometimes confused with stuttering. Both communication disorders break the normal flow of speech. However, while stuttering is most often analyzed as a speech disorder, cluttering is a language disorder. In other words, a stutterer has a coherent pattern of thoughts, but can't say express those thoughts; in contrast, a clutterer has no problem putting thoughts into words, but those thoughts become disorganized during speaking.  Cluttering not only affects speech, but affects thought patterns, writing, typing, and conversation.<ref>[http://www.stammering.org/cluttered.html When speech is too cluttered - British Stammering Association<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Stutterers are usually dysfluent on initial sounds, when beginning to speak, and become more fluent towards the ends of utterances. In contrast, clutterers are most clear at the start of utterances, but their speaking rate increases and intelligibility decreases towards the end of utterances.

Stuttering is characterized by struggle behavior, such as overtense speech production muscles. Cluttering, in contrast, is effortless.  Cluttering is also characterized by [[Relaxed pronunciation|slurred speech]], especially dropped or distorted /r/ and /l/ sounds; and monotone speech that starts loud and trails off into a murmur.

A clutterer described the feeling associated with a clutter as:
{{cquote|It feels like 1) about twenty thoughts explode on my mind all at once, and I need to express them all, 2) that when I'm trying to make a point, that I just remembered something that I was supposed to say, so the person can understand, and I need to interrupt myself to say something that I should have said before, and 3) that I need to constantly revise the sentences that I'm working on, to get it out right.<ref>{{cite web

==Differential diagnosis==
Cluttering can often be confused with [[language delay]], [[language disorder]], [[learning disabilities]], and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).<ref>{{cite book

==Treatment==
Because clutterers have poor awareness of their disorder, they may be indifferent or even hostile to speech-language pathologists. [[Delayed auditory feedback]] (DAF) is usually used to produce a more deliberate, exaggerated oral-motor response pattern. Other treatment components include improving [[narrative structure]] with [[Storytelling|story-telling]] [[picture book]]s, turn-taking practice, pausing practice, and language therapy.

==History==
[[Battaros]] was a legendary [[Libya]]n king who spoke quickly and in a disorderly fashion.  Others who spoke as he did were said to suffer from ''battarismus''.<ref>{{cite book

In the 1960s, cluttering was called ''tachyphemia'', a word derived from the Greek for "fast speech." This word is no longer used to describe cluttering because fast speech is not a required element of cluttering.

Deso Weiss described cluttering as the outward manifestation of a "central language imbalance."<ref>{{cite book

==Society and culture==
Weiss claimed that Battaros, [[Demosthenes]], [[Pericles]], [[Justinian]], [[Otto von Bismarck]], and [[Winston Churchill]] were clutterers.  He says about these people, "Each of these contributors to [[World History|world history]] viewed his world holistically, and was not deflected by exaggerated attention to small details.  Perhaps then, they excelled because of, rather than in spite of, their

The animated character [[Porky Pig]], who has often been described as a stutterer, has a style of speech similar to cluttering.{{cn|date=December 2012}}
