'''Myelofibrosis''', also known as '''myeloid metaplasia''', '''chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis''', '''osteomyelofibrosis''' and '''primary myelofibrosis''' is a disorder of the [[bone marrow]]. It is currently classified as a [[myeloproliferative disease]] in which the proliferation of an abnormal type of [[bone marrow]] stem cell results in [[fibrosis]], or the replacement of the marrow with [[collagen]]ous connective tissue fibers.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|five/000069423|myelofibrosis}}</ref>

==History and terminology==
Myelofibrosis was first described in 1879 by [[Gustav Heuck]].<ref name="pmid15902283">{{cite journal |author=Lichtman MA |title=Is it chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia, chronic megakaryocytic-granulocytic myelosis, or chronic megakaryocytic leukemia?

Older terms include "myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia" and "agnogenic myeloid metaplasia". The [[World Health Organization]] utilizes the name "chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis", while the International Working Group on Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment calls the disease "primary myelofibrosis".  Eponyms for the disease are Heuck-Assmann disease or Assmann's Disease, for [[Herbert Assmann]],<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2799}},</ref> who published a description under the term "osteosclerosis" in 1907.<ref name="Ansell2008">{{cite book|last=Ansell|first=Stephen M.|title=Rare Hematological Malignancies|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cR_kOJoN7sYC&pg=PA28|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media, LLC|isbn=978-0-387-73744-7|pages=28–}}</ref>

It was characterised as a [[myeloproliferative]] condition in 1951 by Dameshek.<ref name="Karp2007">{{cite book|author=Judith E.

==Signs and symptoms==

*Abdominal fullness related to an [[splenomegaly|enlarged spleen]] (splenomegaly).
*Bone pain
*Bruising and easy bleeding due to inadequate numbers of [[platelets]]
*Fatigue
*Increased susceptibility to infection, such as [[pneumonia]] or [[diarrhea]]
*Pallor and shortness of breath while doing physical work due to [[anemia]]
*Because of a high rate of cell turnover, [[hyperuricemia]] and [[gout]] may also complicate the picture
*In rarer cases, a raised [[Mean corpuscular volume]] above normal ranges (I.e. 100fl+)

==Clinical course==
*Primary myelofibrosis can begin with a blood picture suggestive of [[Polycythemia vera|Polycythemia Vera]] or [[Chronic myelogenous leukemia|CML]]
*Most patients have moderate to severe anemia
*Eventually the patient develops [[thrombocytopenia]]
*The peripheral smear appears markedly abnormal
*Red cell abnormality includes bizarre shapes, (tear drop- shaped RBCs).
*Nucleated erythroid precursors are seen in the peripheral blood
*Immature white cells are also seen and basophils are increased
*Teardrop shaped red blood cells on a peripheral smear

== Morphology ==
The principal site of extramedullary hematopoiesis in myeloid metaplasia with primary myelofibrosis is the spleen which is usually markedly enlarged, sometimes weighing as much as 4000 g. As is always true when splenomegaly is massive, multiple subcapsular infarcts are often present. Histologically the spleen contains normoblast, granulocyte precursor and megakaryocytes, which are often prominent in terms of their numbers and bizarre morphology. Sometimes disproportional activity of any one of the three major cell lines is seen.

The liver is often moderately enlarged, with foci of extramedullary hematopoiesis. Microscopically, lymph nodes also contain foci of hematopoiesis, but these are insufficient to cause enlargement.

The bone marrow in a typical case is hypercellular and diffusely fibrotic. Both early and late in disease, megakaryocytes are often prominent and are usually dysplastic.

==Pathophysiology==
The bone marrow is replaced by collagen fibrosis, impairing the patient's ability to generate new blood cells resulting in a progressive [[pancytopenia]]. It is usually reactive following other [[myeloproliferative disorders]], such as [[polycythemia vera]], chronic myeloid leukemia or [[essential thrombocytosis]]. [[Extramedullary haematopoeisis]] occurs as the haemopoetic cells migrate away from the bone marrow, to the liver and spleen. Patients often have [[hepatosplenomegaly]] and [[poikilocytosis]].

In primary myelofibrosis, a progressive scarring ([[fibrosis]]) of the bone marrow occurs. As a result, blood forms in sites other than the bone marrow, such as the [[liver]] and [[spleen]]. This causes an enlargement of these organs. The cause and risk factors are unknown.  It commonly occurs in the spent phase of [[Polycythemia rubra vera]], possibly in response to the medication [[hydroxyurea]] poisoning the marrow and blood.

==Treatment==

The one known treatment is allogeneic [[stem cell transplantation]], but this approach involves significant risks.<ref name="pmid15725078">{{cite journal |author=Cervantes F |title=Modern management of myelofibrosis |journal=Br.

In November 2011, the FDA approved [[ruxolitinib]] (Jakafi) as a treatment for myelofibrosis.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://investor.incyte.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=69764&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1631201&highlight= |title=FDA Approves Incyte's Jakafi(TM) (ruxolitinib) for Patients with Myelofibrosis |publisher=Incyte |accessdate=2012-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=McCallister E, Usdin S |title=A PROfessional Trial|journal=BioCentury, December 5th 2011  }}</ref> Ruxolitinib is a twice daily drug which serves as an inhibitor of JAK 1 and 2.
The ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' (NEJM) published results from two Phase III studies of Jakafi™ (ruxolitinib), a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF). These data, which were included in the New Drug Application for Jakafi, showed that the treatment significantly reduced spleen volume and improved symptoms of MF. Additionally, in an updated analysis, treatment with Jakafi was associated with improved overall survival compared to placebo.<ref>Claire Harrison, D.M., Jean-Jacques Kiladjian, M.D., Ph.D., Haifa Kathrin Al-Ali, M.D., Heinz Gisslinger, M.D., Roger Waltzman, M.D., M.B.A., Viktoriya Stalbovskaya, Ph.D., Mari McQuitty, R.N., M.P.H., Deborah S.

==Epidemiology==
The disorder usually develops slowly and is mainly observed in people over the age of 50.<ref>[http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec11/ch141/ch141c.html Primary Myelofibrosis], Merck.</ref>  It may also develop as a side-effect of treatment with some drugs that target [[hematology|hematological disorders]].
