The '''1984 Rajneeshee [[bioterror]] attack''' was the [[food poisoning]] of 751&nbsp;individuals in [[The Dalles, Oregon]], United States, through the deliberate contamination of [[salad bar]]s at ten local restaurants with [[salmonella]]. A leading group of followers of [[Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh]] (later known as Osho) had hoped to incapacitate the voting population of the city so that their own candidates would win the 1984 [[Wasco County, Oregon|Wasco County]] elections.<ref name="flaccus">{{cite news | last =Flaccus | first =Gillian | title =Ore.

Having previously gained political control of [[Antelope, Oregon]], Rajneesh's followers based in nearby [[Rajneeshpuram]], Oregon, sought election to two of the three seats on the Wasco County Circuit Court that were up for election in November 1984. Fearing they would not gain enough votes, Rajneeshpuram officials decided to incapacitate voters in The Dalles, the largest population center in Wasco County. The chosen biological agent was ''[[Salmonella enterica]]'' Typhimurium, which was first delivered through glasses of water to two County Commissioners and then, on a larger scale, at salad bars and in salad dressing.

751 people contracted [[salmonellosis]] as a result of the attack; 45&nbsp;of them were hospitalized. There were no fatalities. Although an initial investigation by the [[Oregon Department of Human Services|Oregon Public Health Division]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control]] did not rule out deliberate contamination, the actual source of the contamination was only discovered a year later. On February 28, 1985, Congressman [[James H. Weaver]] gave a speech in the [[United States House of Representatives]] in which he "accused the Rajneeshees of sprinkling salmonella culture on salad bar ingredients in eight restaurants".<ref name="nytimesweaver" /> At a press conference in September 1985, Rajneesh accused several of his followers of involvement in this and other crimes, including an [[1985 Rajneeshee assassination plot|aborted plan]] to assassinate a [[United States Attorney]], and he asked State and Federal authorities to investigate.<ref name="gordon">{{cite book | last =Gordon | first =James S. | title =The Golden Guru – The Strange Journey of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh | publisher =The Stephen Greene Press | year =1987 | pages =Page 181–182 | id = | isbn =0-8289-0630-0}}</ref> [[Oregon Attorney General]] [[David B. Frohnmayer]] set up an Interagency Task Force, composed of [[Oregon State Police]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], and executed [[search warrant]]s in [[Rajneeshpuram]]. A sample of bacteria matching the contaminant that had sickened the town residents was found in a Rajneeshpuram medical laboratory. Two leading Rajneeshpuram officials were indicted and served 29&nbsp;months in a minimum-security [[federal prison]].
