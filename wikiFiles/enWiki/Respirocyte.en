'''Respirocytes''' are hypothetical, microscopic, artificial [[red blood cell]]s that can emulate the function of its organic counterpart, only with 200 times the efficiency, so as to supplement or replace the function of much of the human body's normal [[respiratory system]]. Still entirely theoretical, respirocytes would measure 1 [[micrometer (unit)|micrometer]] in diameter. In the original paper by [[Robert A. Freitas Jr|Robert Freitas]], titled, "A Mechanical Artificial Red Blood Cell: Exploratory Design in Medical Nanotechnology" (1998), it was proposed that respirocytes would mimic the action of the natural [[hemoglobin]]-filled red blood cells.<ref name=ref2>{{cite journal|author=Robert A. Freitas Jr.|title=Exploratory Design in Medical Nanotechnology: A Mechanical Artificial Red Cell|journal=Artificial Cells, Blood Substitutes, and Immobil. Biotech.|number=26|year=1998|pages=411–430}}</ref> The proposed design of the spherical [[robot|nanorobot]] is made up of 18 billion atoms arranged as a tiny [[pressure tank]], which would be filled up with [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]],<ref name =REF1>{{cite web|title=RESPIROCYTES – IMPROVING UPON NATURE'S DESIGN: BREATHE EASY WITH RESPIROCYTES|url=http://www.thenanoage.com/respirocytes.htm}}</ref> making one complete transfer point at the lungs, and the reverse transfer at the body's tissues.

==Uses==
Per proposals, each respirocyte could store and transport 236 times more oxygen than a natural red blood cell,<ref name=ref3>{{cite web|last=The Nano Page|title=Respirocyte as an invention of nanotechnology|url=http://www.thenanoage.com/respirocytes.htm}}</ref> and could release it in a more controlled manner. If an adult human's red blood cells were entirely replaced with these devices, that person could hold his/her breath underwater for hours, making such devices extremely suitable for divers, who would then be able to dive for hours in a single breath, while avoiding both the bends [[decompression sickness]] or [[nitrogen narcosis]] (Afflictions caused by breathing compressed air under water, thus allowing more nitrogen, than at one atmosphere of pressure, to be dissolved into the bloodstream).<ref name=ref3/> 

Respirocytes also have the potential to allow an adult human to [[Sprint (race)|sprint]] at top speed for at least 15 minutes without taking a breath.<ref name=ref3/><ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/07/15/bio.tech/index.html CNN – Scientists: Humans and machines will merge in future]</ref>

[[Muscle fatigue]] results from inadequate supply of oxygen to the muscles during intense exercise, leading to inefficient [[lactic acid fermentation]]. If respirocytes could increase the supply of oxygen despite exercise, it should be possible to reduce muscle fatigue, increasing a person's [[endurance]].

Theorist [[Robert Freitas]] has proposed respirocytes as a superior alternative to naturally occurring red blood cells, and has similarly proposed "microbivore" robots that would attack [[pathogens]] in the manner of [[white blood cells]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Kurzweil | first = Ray | authorlink = Ray Kurzweil | coauthors = | title = The Singularity Is Near | publisher = | date = | location = | pages = 254 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}</ref>

==Development and consequences==
By definition, respirocytes qualify as [[molecular nanotechnology]], a field of technology still in the very earliest, purely theoretical phases of development. Current technology could, therefore, not be sufficient to build a respirocyte due to considerations of power, immune reaction or [[toxicity]], [[computation]] and [[communication]].

Because respirocytes and related technologies would, if successful, improve the user's abilities beyond normal human limits, their design is associated with the [[Transhumanism]] movement which seeks such advances.
