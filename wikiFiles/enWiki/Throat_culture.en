A '''throat culture''' is a laboratory [[diagnostic test]] to find a bacterial or fungal infection in the throat. [[Sampling (medicine)|Sampling]] is performed by [[throat swab]], and the sample is put in a special cup (culture) that allows infections to grow. If an infection grows, the culture is positive. The type of infection is found using a microscope, chemical tests, or both. If no infection grows, the culture is negative.

Examples of infections that may be found during a throat culture include: 

*''Candida albicans''

This fungus causes thrush, an infection of the mouth and tongue and sometimes of the throat. See a picture of thrush in the mouth.{{where?|date=March 2013}} 

*Group A ''[[streptococcus]]''

This bacteria can cause strep throat, scarlet fever, and rheumatic fever. If strep throat is likely, a test called a ''rapid strep test'' (or ''quick strep'') may be done before a throat culture. With a rapid strep test, results are ready in 10 minutes instead of 1 to 2 days with a throat culture. If the rapid strep test results are positive, antibiotics can be started immediately. A throat culture is more accurate than the rapid strep test. The rapid strep test can give false-negative results even when strep bacteria are present. When the results of a rapid strep test are negative, many health professionals recommend doing a throat culture to make sure that strep throat is not present.

*''Neisseria meningitidis''

This bacteria can cause [[meningitis]]. If bacteria grows in the culture, other tests may be done to check which antibiotic will treat the infection best. This is called susceptibility or sensitivity testing.

==Why it is done==
A throat culture may be done to:

*Find the cause of a sore throat. Most sore throat infections are caused by a virus. A throat culture shows the difference between a bacterial infection and a viral infection. Finding the organism that is causing the infection can guide treatment.

*Check a person who may not have any symptoms of infection but who carries bacteria that can spread to others. This person is called a ''carrier''.

==How to prepare==
The patient does not need to do anything before having this test. The health professional should know if the patient has recently taken any antibiotics.

==How it is done==
The patient will be asked to tilt her/his head back and open her/his mouth as wide as possible. The health professional will press the tongue down with a flat stick (''tongue depressor'') and then examine the mouth and throat. A clean swab will be rubbed over the back of the throat, around the tonsils, and over any red areas or sores to collect a sample.

The sample may also be collected using a throat washout. For this test, the patient will gargle a small amount of salt water and then spit the fluid into a clean cup. This method gives a larger sample than a throat swab and may make the culture more reliable.
