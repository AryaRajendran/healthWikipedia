'''Tetanus''' (from {{lang-grc|τέτανος|tetanos|taut}}, and τείνειν ''teinein'' "to stretch")<ref>[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/Tetanus tetanus]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete & Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved October 01, 2012</ref> is a medical condition characterized by a prolonged contraction of [[skeletal muscle]] fibers. The primary symptoms are caused by [[tetanospasmin]], a [[neurotoxin]] produced  [[Gram-positive]], [[Bacillus|rod-shaped]], [[Anaerobic organism|obligate anaerobic bacterium]] ''[[Clostridium tetani]]''.<ref name="Baron">{{cite book | author = Wells CL, Wilkins TD | chapter = Clostridia: Sporeforming Anaerobic Bacilli | title = Baron's Medical Microbiology | editor= Baron S, ''et al'' | year = 1996 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.1099 | isbn = 0-9631172-1-1|publisher = Univ of Texas Medical Branch }}</ref>

Infection generally occurs through wound contamination and often involves a cut or deep puncture wound. As the infection progresses, muscle [[spasm]]s develop in the jaw (thus the name "lockjaw") and elsewhere in the body.<ref name="Baron"/> Infection can be prevented by proper immunization and by [[post-exposure prophylaxis#Tetanus|post-exposure prophylaxis]].<ref name="CDC">{{cite web | title=Tetanus | work=CDC Pink Book | url=http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/tetanus.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2007-01-26}}</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
Tetanus often begins with mild spasms in the jaw muscles (lockjaw). The spasms can also affect the chest, neck, back,  abdominal muscles,and bottom. Back muscle spasms often cause arching, called opisthotonos.
Sometimes the spasms affect muscles that help with breathing, which can lead to breathing problems.<ref name="CDC" />

Prolonged muscular action causes sudden, powerful, and painful contractions of muscle groups. This is called tetany. These episodes can cause fractures and muscle tears.
Other symptoms include drooling, excessive sweating, fever, hand or foot spasms, irritability, swallowing difficulty, uncontrolled urination or defecation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Mechanism of Action of the Toxin ==
Tetanus affects [[skeletal muscle]], a type of [[striated muscle]] used in voluntary movement. The other type of striated muscle, cardiac or [[heart muscle]], cannot be [[Tetanized state|tetanized]] because of its intrinsic electrical properties. Mortality rates reported vary from 48% to 73%. In recent years,{{when|date=May 2012}} approximately 11% of reported tetanus cases have been [[Death|fatal]]. The highest [[mortality rate]]s are in unvaccinated people and people over 60 years of age or newborns.<ref name="CDC" />
The tetanus toxin initially binds to peripheral nerve terminals. It is transported within the axon and across synaptic junctions until it reaches the central nervous system. There it becomes rapidly fixed to gangliosides at the presynaptic inhibitory motor nerve endings, and is taken up into the axon by endocytosis. The effect of the toxin is to block the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters (glycine and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) across the synaptic cleft, which is required to check the nervous impulse. If nervous impulses cannot be checked by normal inhibitory mechanisms, it produces the generalized muscular spasms characteristic of tetanus. The toxin appears to act by selective cleavage of a protein component of synaptic vesicles, synaptobrevin II, and this prevents the release of neurotransmitters by the cells. <ref>http://textbookofbacteriology.net/themicrobialworld/Tetanus.html</ref>

=== Incubation period ===

The [[incubation period]] of tetanus may be up to several months but is usually about eight days.<ref>{{cite journal

}}</ref> In neonatal tetanus, symptoms usually appear from 4 to 14 days after birth, averaging about 7 days. On the basis of clinical findings, four different forms of tetanus have been described.<ref name="CDC" />

=== Generalized tetanus ===
This is the most common type of tetanus, representing about 80% of cases. The generalized form usually presents with a descending pattern. The first sign is [[trismus]], or lockjaw, and the facial spasms called [[risus sardonicus]], followed by stiffness of the neck, difficulty in swallowing, and rigidity of pectoral and [[Calf (anatomy)|calf]] muscles. Other symptoms include elevated temperature, sweating, elevated [[blood pressure]], and episodic rapid heart rate. [[Spasm]]s may occur frequently and last for several minutes with the body shaped into a characteristic form called [[opisthotonos]]. Spasms continue for up to 4 weeks, and complete recovery may take months.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}
Death can occur within four days.

=== Neonatal tetanus ===
This is a form of generalized tetanus that occurs in newborns. Infants who have not acquired [[passive immunity]] because the mother has never been immunized are at risk. It usually occurs through infection of the unhealed umbilical stump, particularly when the stump is cut with a non-sterile instrument. Neonatal tetanus is common in many developing countries and is responsible for about 14% (215,000) of all neonatal deaths, but is very rare in developed countries.<ref name="WHO_2000">{{cite web | title=Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination by 2005 | year=2000 | month = November | publisher = UNICEF | url=http://www.unicef.org/immunization/files/MNTE_strategy_paper.pdf | accessdate=2007-01-26 }}</ref>

=== Local tetanus ===
This is an uncommon form of the disease, in which patients have persistent contraction of muscles in the same anatomic area as the injury. The contractions may persist for many weeks before gradually subsiding. Local tetanus is generally milder; only about 1% of cases are fatal, but it may precede the onset of generalized tetanus.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== Cephalic tetanus ===
This is a rare form<ref>{{cite journal | title=Cephalic Tetanus : A Rare Form of Localized Tetanus | author=DS Asgaonkar, VK Kulkarni, S Yadav, A Dalvi | url=http://www.bhj.org/journal/2002_4401_jan/case_121.htm | journal = Bombay Hospital Journal | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | month = January | year = 2002 | accessdate=2012-02-03}}</ref> of the disease, occasionally occurring with [[otitis media]] (ear infections) in which ''C.&nbsp;tetani'' is present in the flora of the middle ear, or following injuries to the head. There is involvement of the [[cranial nerve]]s, especially in the facial area.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

== Cause ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
Tetanus is caused by the tetanus bacterium ''[[Clostridium tetani]]''. Tetanus is often associated with [[rust]], especially rusty nails, but this concept is somewhat misleading. Objects that accumulate rust are often found outdoors, or in places that harbor anaerobic bacteria, but the rust itself does not cause tetanus nor does it contain more ''C.&nbsp;tetani'' bacteria. The rough surface of rusty metal merely provides a prime habitat for ''C.&nbsp;tetani'' endospores to reside in, and the nail affords a means to puncture skin and deliver endospores deep within the body at the site of the wound.

An [[endospore]] is a non-metabolizing survival structure that begins to metabolize and cause infection once in an adequate environment. Because ''C.&nbsp;tetani'' is an anaerobic bacterium, it and its endospores thrive in environments that lack [[oxygen]]. Hence, stepping on a nail (rusty or not) may result in a tetanus infection, as the low-oxygen (anaerobic) environment is caused by the oxidization of the same object that causes a [[puncture wound]], delivering endospores to a suitable environment for growth.

== Diagnosis ==
There are currently no blood tests for diagnosing tetanus. The diagnosis is based on the presentation of tetanus symptoms and does not depend upon isolation of the bacterium, which is recovered from the wound in only 30% of cases and can be isolated from patients without tetanus. Laboratory identification of ''C. tetani'' can be demonstrated only by production of tetanospasmin in mice.<ref name=CDC/>

The "spatula test" is a clinical test for tetanus that involves touching the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] [[Human pharynx|pharyngeal]] wall with a sterile, soft-tipped instrument and observing the effect. A positive test result is the involuntary contraction of the jaw (biting down on the "spatula") and a negative test result would normally be a [[gag reflex]] attempting to expel the foreign object. A short report in ''The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene'' states that, in a patient research study, the spatula test had a high specificity (zero false-positive test results) and a high sensitivity (94% of infected patients produced a positive test result).<ref name="AJTMH1995">{{cite journal | url=http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/content/abstract/53/4/386| title=Short Report: The Spatula Test: A Simple Bedside Test to Diagnose Tetanus |accessdate=2007-10-11 |author=Apte NM, Karnad DR | month = October | year = 1995 | volume = 53 | issue = 4 |journal=Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. |pages=386–7 | pmid = 7485691 }}</ref>

== Prevention ==
Unlike many infectious diseases, recovery from naturally acquired tetanus does not usually result in [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to tetanus. This is due to the extreme potency of the tetanospasmin toxin; even a lethal dose of tetanospasmin is insufficient to provoke an immune response.

Tetanus can be prevented by [[vaccination]] with [[tetanus vaccine|tetanus toxoid]].<ref name=MMWR_1991>{{cite journal | author = Hopkins, A.| title = Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis: recommendation for vaccine use and other preventive measures.

The booster may not prevent a potentially fatal case of tetanus from the current wound, however, as it can take up to two weeks for tetanus antibodies to form.<ref name="pmid1574917">{{cite journal |author=Porter JD, Perkin MA, Corbel MJ, Farrington CP, Watkins JT, Begg NT |title=Lack of early antitoxin response to tetanus booster |journal=Vaccine |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=334–6 |year=1992 |pmid=1574917 |doi= 10.1016/0264-410X(92)90373-R|url=}}</ref>

In children under the age of seven, the tetanus vaccine is often administered as a combined vaccine, [[DPT vaccine|DPT/DTaP vaccine]], which also includes vaccines against [[diphtheria]] and [[pertussis]]. For adults and children over seven, the Td vaccine (tetanus and diphtheria) or Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis) is commonly used.<ref name=MMWR_1991 />

The WHO certifies countries as having eliminated maternal or neonatal tetanus. Certification requires at least two years of rates < 1 case per 1000 live borns. In 1998 in Uganda, 3,433 tetanus cases were recorded in new-born babies; of these, 2,403 died. After a major public health effort, Uganda in 2011 was certified as having eliminated tetanus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201107150259.html |title=Uganda: Nation Free of Maternal And Neonatal Tetanus, Unicef Reports |accessdate=2011-07-14}}</ref>

=== Mild tetanus ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
Mild cases of tetanus can be treated with:
* tetanus immunoglobulin [[Intravenous therapy|IV]] or [[Intramuscular injection|IM]]
* [[metronidazole]] [[Intravenous therapy|IV]] for 10 days
* [[diazepam]]

=== Severe tetanus ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
Severe cases will require admission to [[intensive care]]. In addition to the measures listed above for mild tetanus:
* human tetanus immunoglobulin injected [[intrathecal]]ly (increases clinical improvement from 4% to 35%)
* [[tracheotomy]] and [[mechanical ventilation]] for 3 to 4 weeks
* [[magnesium]], as an [[intravenous]] (IV) infusion, to prevent muscle spasm
* [[diazepam]] as a continuous IV infusion
* the [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] effects of tetanus can be difficult to manage (alternating hyper- and [[hypotension]] [[hyperpyrexia]]/[[hypothermia]]) and may require IV [[labetalol]], magnesium, [[clonidine]], or [[nifedipine]].

Drugs such as [[diazepam]] or other [[muscle relaxant]]s can be given to control the muscle spasms. In extreme cases it may be necessary to paralyze the patient with [[curare]]-like drugs and use a mechanical ventilator.

In order to survive a tetanus infection, the maintenance of an airway and proper [[nutrition]] are required. An intake of 3500-4000 calories, and at least 150&nbsp;g of protein per day, is often given in liquid form through a tube directly into the stomach ([[percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy]]), or through a drip into a vein ([[parenteral nutrition]]). This high-caloric diet maintenance is required because of the increased metabolic strain brought on by the increased muscle activity. Full recovery takes 4 to 6 weeks because the body must regenerate destroyed nerve [[axon]] terminals.

[[Image:Tetanos.png|thumb|450px|Tetanus cases reported worldwide (1990-2004). Ranging from strongly prevalent (in dark red) to very few cases (in light yellow) (grey, no data).]]

Tetanus is an international health problem, as ''C.&nbsp;tetani'' spores are ubiquitous. The disease occurs almost exclusively in persons unvaccinated or inadequately immunized.<ref name=Baron /> Tetanus occurs worldwide but is more common in hot, damp climates with soil rich in organic matter. This is particularly true with [[manure]]-treated soils, as the spores are widely distributed in the intestines and feces of many non-human animals such as horses, sheep, cattle, dogs, cats, rats, guinea pigs, and chickens.<ref name= CDC/>

Spores can be introduced into the body through puncture wounds. In agricultural areas, a significant number of human adults may harbor the organism. The spores can also be found on skin surfaces and in contaminated [[heroin]].<ref name= CDC/> Heroin users, particularly those that inject the drug, appear to be at high risk for tetanus.

Tetanus &ndash; in particular, the [[neonatal]] form &ndash; remains a significant public health problem in non-industrialized countries. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that 59,000 newborns worldwide died in 2008 as a result of neonatal tetanus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/diseases/MNTE_initiative/en/index.html |title=Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus (MNT) elimination |work=WHO |accessdate=2010-11-02}}</ref> In the United States, from 2000 through 2007 an average of 31 cases were reported per year.<ref name= CDC/> Nearly all of the cases in the United States occur in unimmunized individuals or individuals who have allowed their [[inoculation]]s to lapse.<ref name= CDC/>

Tetanus is the only vaccine-preventable disease that is [[infectious disease|infectious]] but is not [[Contagious disease|contagious]].<ref name="CDC"/>

==History==
Tetanus was well known to ancient people who recognized the relationship between wounds and fatal muscle spasms.<ref name="PMC1073859">{{cite journal |author=Pearce JM |title=Notes on tetanus (lockjaw) |journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=332 |year=1996 |pmid=8609513 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.60.3.332|pmc=1073859}}</ref> In 1884, [[Arthur Nicolaier]] isolated the [[strychnine]]-like toxin of tetanus from free-living, anaerobic soil bacteria. The etiology of the disease was further elucidated in 1884 by [[Antonio Carle]] and [[Giorgio Rattone]], two pathologists of the [[university of Turin]], who demonstrated the transmissibility of tetanus for the first time. They produced tetanus in rabbits by injecting pus from a patient with fatal tetanus into their sciatic nerves.<ref name="CDC" />

In 1891, [[Clostridium tetani|''C. tetani'']] was isolated from a human victim by [[Kitasato Shibasaburō]], who later showed that the organism could produce disease when injected into animals, and that the toxin could be neutralized by specific [[antibodies]]. In 1897, [[Edmond Nocard]] showed that tetanus antitoxin induced [[passive immunity]] in humans, and could be used for [[prophylaxis]] and treatment. Tetanus toxoid [[vaccine]] was developed by P. Descombey in 1924, and was widely used to prevent tetanus induced by battle wounds during [[World War II]].<ref name="CDC" />
