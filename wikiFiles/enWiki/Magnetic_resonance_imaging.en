'''Magnetic Resonance Imaging''' ('''MRI'''), '''nuclear magnetic resonance imaging''' ('''NMRI'''), or '''magnetic resonance tomography''' ('''MRT''') is a [[medical imaging]] technique used in [[radiology]] to visualize internal structures of the body in detail. MRI makes use of the property of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) to image nuclei of atoms inside the body. MRI can create more detailed images of the human body than possible with X-rays.

An MRI scanner is a device in which the patient lies within a large, powerful [[magnetism|magnet]] where the magnetic field is used to align the [[Nuclear magnetic moment|magnetization]] of some [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] in the body, and [[radio frequency]] magnetic fields are applied to systematically alter the alignment of this magnetization.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sheil|first=W. C.|title=Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI Scan)|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm|publisher=MedicineNet.com|accessdate=27 April 2012}}</ref> This causes the nuclei to produce a rotating magnetic field detectable by the scanner—and this information is recorded to construct an image of the scanned area of the body.<ref name="squires">

Magnetic field gradients cause nuclei at different locations to precess at different speeds, which allows spatial information to be recovered using [[Fourier transform|Fourier analysis]] of the measured signal.
By using gradients in different directions, 2D images or 3D volumes can be obtained in any arbitrary orientation.

MRI provides good [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] between the different [[soft tissues]] of the body, which makes it especially useful in imaging the [[Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain|brain]], [[human musculoskeletal system|muscles]], the [[cardiovascular|heart]], and [[oncology|cancers]] compared with other [[medical imaging]] techniques such as [[computed tomography]] (CT) or [[Medical radiography|X-ray]]s. Unlike CT scans or traditional X-rays, MRI does not use [[ionizing radiation]].<ref name="Magnetic Resonance Imaging">

==How MRI works==
{{refimprove section|dte=October 2011|date=September 2012}}
{{Main|Physics of magnetic resonance imaging}}
MRI machines make use of the fact that body tissue contains lots of water, and hence [[proton]]s (<sup>1</sup>H nuclei), which get aligned in a large magnetic field.<ref name="Ct scan vs mri: Comparison chart">{{cite web|title=Ct scan vs mri: Comparison chart|url=http://www.diffen.com/difference/CT_Scan_vs_MRI|publisher=Diffen|accessdate=27 April 2012}}</ref>  Each water molecule has two [[hydrogen]] [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] or [[proton]]s.  When a person is inside the powerful [[magnetic field]] of the scanner, the average [[magnetic dipole moment|magnetic moment]] of many protons becomes aligned with the direction of the field. A radio frequency current is briefly turned on, producing a varying [[electromagnetic field]]. This electromagnetic field has just the right frequency, known as the [[resonance]] [[frequency]], to be absorbed and flip the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of the protons in the magnetic field. After the electromagnetic field is turned off, the spins of the protons return to thermodynamic equilibrium and the bulk magnetization becomes re-aligned with the static magnetic field. During this relaxation, a radio frequency signal ([[electromagnetic radiation]] in the RF range) is generated, which can be measured with receiver coils.

Information about the origin of the signal in [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] space can be learned by applying additional magnetic fields during the scan. These additional magnetic fields can be used to only generate detectable signal from specific locations in the body (spatial excitation) and/or to make magnetization at different spatial locations precess at different frequencies, which enables [[K-space (MRI)|k-space]] encoding of spatial information.  The 3D images obtained in MRI can be rotated along arbitrary orientations and manipulated by the doctor to be better able to detect tiny changes of structures within the body.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shiel|first=W. C.|title=Magnetic Resonance Imaging  (MRI Scan)|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/mri_scan/article.htm|publisher=MedicineNet.com|accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref>  These fields, generated by passing electric currents through gradient coils, make the magnetic field strength vary depending on the position within the magnet. Because this makes the frequency of the released radio signal also dependent on its origin in a predictable manner, the distribution of protons in the body can be
mathematically recovered from the signal, typically by the use of the inverse [[Fourier transform]].

Protons in different tissues return to their equilibrium state at different relaxation rates. Different tissue variables, including
spin density, ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub> relaxation times, and flow and spectral shifts can be used to construct images.<ref name="Ocean NanoTech">{{cite web|title=MRI Contrast Agent|url=http://www.oceannanotech.com/nav.php?qid=9|publisher=Ocean NanoTech|accessdate=27 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hendee |first1=William R |last2=Morgan |first2= Christopher J |year=1984 |title=Magnetic Resonance Imaging Part I—Physical Principles |journal=West J Med. |volume141= |issue=4 |pages=491–500 |pmc=1021860 | pmid=6506686 |volume=141 }}</ref> By changing the settings on the scanner, this effect is used to create contrast between different types 
of body tissue or between other properties, as in [[fMRI]] and [[diffusion MRI]].

MRI is used to image every part of the body, and is particularly useful for tissues with many hydrogen nuclei and little density contrast, such as the [[Human brain|brain]], [[muscle]], [[connective tissue]] and most [[tumor]]s.

===Magnetic field===
MRI scans require a [[magnetic field]] with two properties, [[Homogeneity (physics)|uniform field density]] and strength.  The magnetic field cannot vary more than 1/10,000 of 1% and field strength ranges (depending on the scanner) from 0.2 to 3 [[Tesla (unit)|teslas]] in strength in currently clinically used scanners, with research scanners investigating higher field strengths such as seven teslas.  The lower field strengths can be achieved with permanent magnets, which are often used in "open" MRI scanners, for [[Claustrophobia|claustrophobic]] patients.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ajronline.org/content/154/4/777.full.pdf | title=MR of the shoulder with a 0.2-T permanent-magnet unit.}}</ref> Higher field strengths can be achieved only with superconducting magnets. An MRI with a 3.0 tesla strength magnet may be referred to as a "3-T MRI" or "3-tesla MRI"

Since the gradient coils are within the bore of the scanner, there are large forces between them and the main field coils, producing most of the noise that is heard during operation. Without efforts to damp this noise, it can approach 130 [[decibels]] (dB) with strong fields <ref>{{cite doi|10.1080/000164800750000270}}</ref> (see also the subsection on [[#Acoustic noise|acoustic noise]]).

===Contrast agents and implants===
[[MRI contrast agent]]s may be injected [[intravenous therapy|intravenously]] to enhance the appearance of [[blood vessel]]s, [[neoplasm|tumors]] or [[inflammation]].  Contrast agents may also be directly injected into a joint in the case of [[arthrogram]]s: MRI images of joints.  Unlike [[Computed Tomography|CT]], MRI uses no [[ionizing radiation]] and is generally a very safe procedure.  Nonetheless the strong magnetic fields and radio pulses can affect metal implants, including [[cochlear implant]]s and [[cardiac pacemaker]]s. There are many electronically activated devices that have approval from the US FDA to permit MRI procedures in patients under highly specific MRI conditions (see www.MRIsafety.com).  In the case of cochlear implants, the [[US FDA]] has approved some implants for [[cochlear implant#The operation, post-implantation therapy and ongoing effects|MRI compatibility]].  In the case of cardiac pacemakers, the results can sometimes be lethal,<ref>{{Cite journal

===Prepolarized MRI===
In 2001, a research team at Stanford invented a new technique which came to be called "Prepolarized MRI" or PMRI.<ref>{{Citation |last1 = Scott |first1 = Greig |last2 = Chronik |first2 = Blaine |last3 = Xu |first3 = Hao |last4 = Morgan |first4 = Patrick N. |last5 = Wong |first5 = Luchin |last6 = Macovski |first6 = Albert |last7 = Conolly |first7 = Steven |display-authors = 2 |title = A Prepolarized MRI Scanner |journal = Proc.

The first magnet in a PMRI scanner is strong, but not uniform.  This magnet creates a very strong magnetic field which varies in uniformity by as much as 40%.  This is the "prepolarize" component.  A second much weaker (only requiring the electric power necessary to run two hairdryers) but far more precise magnet then creates a homogeneous magnetic field.  These two magnets can be ordinary [[Copper in energy efficient motors|copper wound magnets]], which greatly lowers the cost of an MRI scanner.<ref name=stanfordPMRI/> Because the magnetic field is "tuned" by the second magnet, a PMRI scan can be obtained immediately adjacent to a metal prosthetic, unlike an MRI scan.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Venook RD, Matter NI, Ramachandran M, Ungersma SE, Gold GE, Giori NJ, Macovski A, Scott GC, Conolly SM |year=2006 |title=Prepolarized magnetic resonance imaging around metal orthopedic implants |journal=Magnetic Resonance in Medicine |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=177–186 |publisher=Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine |pmid=16724303 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16724303 |accessdate=26 April 2012 |doi=10.1002/mrm.20927}}</ref>

===2003 Nobel Prize===
Reflecting the fundamental importance and applicability of MRI in medicine, [[Paul Lauterbur]] of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] and [[Peter Mansfield|Sir Peter Mansfield]] of the [[University of Nottingham]] were awarded the 2003 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their "discoveries concerning magnetic resonance imaging". The Nobel citation acknowledged Lauterbur's insight of using magnetic field gradients to determine spatial localization, a discovery that allowed rapid acquisition of 2D images. Mansfield was credited with introducing the mathematical formalism and developing techniques for efficient gradient utilization and fast imaging. The actual research that won the prize was done almost 30 years before, while Paul Lauterbur was at [[Stony Brook University]] in [[New York (state)|New York]].

The award was vigorously protested by [[Raymond Vahan Damadian]], founder of FONAR Corporation, who claimed that he invented the MRI, and that Lauterbur and Mansfield had merely refined the technology. A group called "The Friends of Raymond Damadian" (formed by Damadian's company, FONAR<ref>{{cite web|title=FONAR press release|url=http://www.fonar.com/news/101603.htm}}</ref>), took out full-page advertisements in the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' entitled "The Shameful Wrong That Must Be Righted", demanding that he be awarded at least a share of the Nobel Prize.<ref>{{cite journal|author=H.F.

==Applications==
In clinical practice, MRI is used to distinguish pathologic tissue (such as a [[brain tumor]]) from normal tissue. One advantage of an MRI scan is that it is harmless to the patient. It uses strong magnetic fields and non-ionizing electromagnetic fields in the radio frequency range, unlike [[computed axial tomography|CT scans]] and [[radiography|traditional X-rays]], which both use [[ionizing radiation]].

While CT provides good [[spatial resolution]] (the ability to distinguish two separate structures an arbitrarily small distance from each other), MRI provides comparable resolution with far better [[contrast resolution]] (the ability to distinguish the differences between two arbitrarily similar but not identical tissues).<ref name="CircleBath Hospital Radiology Department">{{cite web|title=Medical imaging explanations|url=Medical imaging explanations|publisher=The Institution of Engineering and Technology|accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref> The basis of this ability is the complex library of ''pulse sequences'' that the modern medical MRI scanner includes, each of which is optimized to provide ''image contrast'' based on the chemical sensitivity of MRI.<ref name="Magnetic Resonance Imaging">{{cite web|title=Magnetic Resonance Imaging|url=http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/Magnetic Resonance Imaging|publisher=Websters Online Dictionary|accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref>

[[File:TR TE.jpg|thumb|Effects of TR and TE on MR signal.]]
For example, with particular values of the ''echo time'' (''T''<sub>E</sub>) and the ''repetition time'' (''T''<sub>R</sub>), which are basic parameters of image acquisition, a sequence takes on the property of ''T''<sub>2</sub>-weighting. On a ''T''<sub>2</sub>-weighted scan, water- and fluid-containing tissues are bright (most modern ''T''<sub>2</sub> sequences are actually ''fast'' ''T''<sub>2</sub> sequences) and fat-containing tissues are dark. The reverse is true for ''T''<sub>1</sub>-weighted images. Damaged tissue tends to develop [[edema]], which makes a ''T''<sub>2</sub>-weighted sequence sensitive for pathology, and generally able to distinguish pathologic tissue from normal tissue. With the addition of an additional radio frequency pulse and additional manipulation of the magnetic gradients, a ''T''<sub>2</sub>-weighted sequence can be converted to a '''[[Fluid Light Attenuation Inversion Recovery|FLAIR]]''' sequence, in which free water is now dark, but edematous tissues remain bright. This sequence in particular is currently the most sensitive way to evaluate the brain for [[Myelin|demyelinating]] diseases, such as [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref name="Magnetic Resonance Imaging"/>

The typical MRI examination consists of 5–20 sequences, each of which is chosen to provide a particular type of information about the subject tissues. This information is then synthesized by the interpreting [[physician]].<ref name="Magnetic Resonance Imaging"/>

====''T''<sub>1</sub>-weighted MRI====
{{Main|Spin-lattice relaxation time}}

''T''<sub>1</sub>-weighted scans refer to a set of standard scans that depict differences in the spin-lattice (or ''T''<sub>1</sub>) relaxation time of various tissues within the body. ''T''<sub>1</sub> weighted images can be acquired using either [[spin echo]] or [[gradient-echo]] sequences.  ''T''<sub>1</sub>-weighted contrast can be increased with the application of an inversion recovery RF pulse. Gradient-echo based ''T''<sub>1</sub>-weighted sequences can be acquired very rapidly because of their ability to use short inter-pulse repetition times (''T''<sub>R</sub>).  ''T''<sub>1</sub>-weighted sequences are often collected before and after infusion of ''T''<sub>1</sub>-shortening [[MRI contrast agent]]s. In the brain ''T''<sub>1</sub>-weighted scans provide appreciable contrast between gray and white matter.  In the body, ''T''<sub>1</sub> weighted scans work well for differentiating fat from water—with water appearing darker and fat brighter.<ref name=t1>[http://www.mr-tip.com/serv1.php?type=db1&dbs=T1%20Weighted "T1 Weighted"], www.mr-tip.com</ref>

====''T''<sub>2</sub>-weighted MRI====
{{Main|Spin-spin relaxation time}}
''T''<sub>2</sub>-weighted scans are another basic type. Like the ''T''<sub>1</sub>-weighted scan, fat is differentiated from water, but in this case fat shows darker, and water lighter. For example, in the case of cerebral and spinal study, the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) will be lighter in ''T''<sub>2</sub>-weighted images. These scans are therefore particularly well suited to imaging edema, with long ''T''<sub>E</sub> and long ''T''<sub>R</sub>.  Because the [[spin echo]] sequence is less susceptible to inhomogeneities in the magnetic field, these images have long been a clinical workhorse.

====''T''{{su|p=*|b=2}}-weighted MRI====
''T''{{su|p=*|b=2}} (pronounced "T 2 star") weighted scans use a gradient echo (GRE) sequence, with long ''T''<sub>E</sub> and long ''T''<sub>R</sub>.  The gradient echo sequence used does not have the extra refocusing pulse used in [[spin echo]] so it is subject to additional losses above the normal ''T''<sub>2</sub> decay (referred to as ''T''<sub>2</sub>&prime;), these taken together are called ''T''{{su|p=*|b=2}}. This also makes it more prone to susceptibility losses at air/tissue boundaries, but can increase contrast for certain types of tissue, such as venous blood.

====Spin density weighted MRI====
Spin density, also called proton density, weighted scans try to have no contrast from either ''T''<sub>2</sub> or ''T''<sub>1</sub> decay, the only signal change coming from differences in the amount of available spins (hydrogen nuclei in water).  It uses a [[spin echo]] or sometimes a gradient echo sequence, with short ''T''<sub>E</sub> and long ''T''<sub>R</sub>.

For example, a molecule inside the [[axon]] of a neuron has a low probability of crossing the [[myelin]] membrane. Therefore the molecule moves principally along the axis of the neural fiber. If it is known that molecules in a particular [[voxel]] diffuse principally in one direction, the assumption can be made that the majority of the fibers in this area are going parallel to that direction.

The recent development of [[diffusion tensor imaging]] (DTI)<ref name=Filler2009b>Filler, AG: The history, development, and impact of computed imaging in neurological diagnosis and neurosurgery: CT, MRI, DTI: [http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3267/version/4 Nature Precedings ] {{doi|10.1038/npre.2009.3267.4}}.</ref> enables diffusion to be measured in multiple directions and the fractional anisotropy in each direction to be calculated for each voxel. This enables researchers to make brain maps of fiber directions to examine the connectivity of different regions in the brain (using [[tractography]]) or to examine areas of neural degeneration and demyelination in diseases like [[multiple sclerosis]].

Another application of diffusion MRI is [[diffusion-weighted imaging]] (DWI). Following an ischemic [[stroke]], DWI is highly sensitive to the changes occurring in the lesion.<ref>
{{cite journal|author=Moseley ME, Cohen Y, Mintorovitch J, Chileuitt L, Shimizu H, Kucharczyk J, Wendland MF, Weinstein PR. |title=Early detection of regional cerebral ischemia in cats: Comparison of diffusion- and ''T''<sub>2</sub>-weighted MRI and spectroscopy  |journal=Magn Reson Med |year=1990 |volume=14 |pages=330–46| pmid=2345513|doi=10.1002/mrm.1910140218|issue=2}}
</ref> It is speculated that increases in restriction (barriers) to water diffusion, as a result of cytotoxic edema (cellular swelling), is responsible for the increase in signal on a DWI scan. The DWI enhancement appears within 5–10 minutes of the onset of stroke symptoms (as compared with [[computed tomography]], which often does not detect changes of acute infarct for up to 4–6 hours) and remains for up to two weeks. Coupled with imaging of [http://www.trauma.org/archive/neuro/cpp.html cerebral perfusion], researchers can highlight regions of "perfusion/diffusion mismatch" that may indicate regions capable of salvage by reperfusion therapy.

Like many other specialized applications, this technique is usually coupled with a fast image acquisition sequence, such as echo planar imaging sequence.

====Magnetization transfer MRI====
{{Main|Magnetization transfer}}

Magnetization transfer (MT) refers to the transfer of longitudinal magnetization from free water protons to hydration water protons in NMR and MRI.

In magnetic resonance imaging of molecular solutions, such as protein solutions, two types of water molecules, free (bulk) and hydration (bound), are found. Free water protons have faster average rotational frequency and hence less fixed water molecules that may cause local field inhomogeneity. Because of this uniformity, most free water protons have resonance frequency lying narrowly around the normal proton resonance frequency of 63&nbsp;MHz (at 1.5 [[tesla]]s). This also results in slower transverse magnetization dephasing and hence longer ''T''<sub>2</sub>. Conversely, hydration water molecules are slowed down by interaction with solute molecules and hence create field inhomogeneities that lead to wider resonance frequency spectrum.

In free liquids, protons, which may be viewed classically as small magnetic dipoles, exhibit translational and rotational motions. These moving dipoles disturb the surrounding magnetic field however on long enough time-scales (which may be nanoseconds) the average field caused by the motion of protons is zero. This is known as "motional averaging" or narrowing and is characteristic of protons moving freely in liquid. On the other hand, protons bound to macromolecules, such as proteins, tend to have a fixed orientation and so the average magnetic field in close proximity to such structures does not average to zero. The result is a spatial pattern in the magnetic field that gives rise to a residual dipolar coupling (range of precession frequencies) for the protons experiencing the magnetic field. The wide frequency distribution appears as a broad spectrum that may be several kHz wide. The net signal from these protons disappears very quickly, in inverse proportion to the width, due to the loss of coherence of the spins, i.e. T2 relaxation. Due to exchange mechanisms, such as spin transfer or proton chemical exchange, the (incoherent) spins bound to the macromolecules continually switch places with (coherent) spins in the bulk media and establish a dynamic equilibrium.

Magnetization transfer: Although there is no measurable signal from the bound spins, or the bound spins that exchange into the bulk media, their longitudinal magnetization is preserved and may recover only via the relatively slow process of T1 relaxation. If the longitudinal magnetization of just the bound spins can be altered, then the effect can be measured in the spins of the bulk media due to the exchange processes. The magnetization transfer sequence applies RF saturation at a frequency that is far off resonance for the narrow line of bulk water but still on resonance for the bound protons with a spectral linewidth of kHz. This causes saturation of the bound spins which exchange into the bulk water, resulting in a loss of longitudinal magnetization and hence signal decrease in the bulk water. This provides an indirect measure of macromolecular content in tissue. Implementation of magnetization transfer involves choosing suitable frequency offsets and pulse shapes to saturate the bound spins sufficiently strongly, within the safety limits of specific absorption rate for RF irradiation.

====T1rho MRI====
{{Main|Spin-lattice relaxation time in the rotating frame}}
T1ρ (T1rho): Molecules have a kinetic energy that is a function of the temperature and is expressed as translational and rotational motions, and by collisions between molecules. The moving dipoles disturb the magnetic field but are often extremely rapid so that the average effect over a long time-scale may be zero. However, depending on the time-scale, the interactions between the dipoles do not always average away. At the slowest extreme the interaction time is effectively infinite and occurs where there are large, stationary field disturbances (e.g. a metallic implant). In this case the loss of coherence is described as a "static dephasing". T2* is a measure of the loss of coherence in an ensemble of spins that include all interactions (including static dephasing). T2 is a measure of the loss of coherence that excludes static dephasing, using an RF pulse to reverse the slowest types of dipolar interaction. There is in fact a continuum of interaction time-scales in a given biological sample and the properties of the refocusing RF pulse can be tuned to refocus more than just static dephasing. In general, the rate of decay of an ensemble of spins is a function of the interaction times and also the power of the RF pulse. This type of decay, occurring under the influence of RF, is known as T1ρ. It is similar to T2 decay but with some slower dipolar interactions refocused as well as the static interactions, hence T1ρ≥T2.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Borthakur|first=A|coauthors=Mellon, E, Niyogi, S, Witschey, W, Kneeland, JB, Reddy, R|title=Sodium and T1rho MRI for molecular and diagnostic imaging of articular cartilage.|journal=NMR in biomedicine|date=2006 Nov|year=2006|volume=19|issue=7|pages=781–821|pmid=17075961|doi=10.1002/nbm.1102|pmc=2896046}}</ref>

to null signal from fluids. For example, it can be used in brain imaging to suppress cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) so as to bring out the periventricular hyperintense lesions, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques. By carefully choosing the inversion time TI (the time between the inversion and excitation pulses), the signal from any particular tissue can be suppressed.

====Magnetic resonance angiography====
[[File:mra1.jpg|thumb|Magnetic resonance angiography]]
{{Main|Magnetic resonance angiography}}
Magnetic resonance [[angiography]] (MRA) generates pictures of the arteries to evaluate them for [[stenosis]] (abnormal narrowing) or [[aneurysm]]s (vessel wall dilatations, at risk of rupture). MRA is often used to evaluate the arteries of the neck and brain, the thoracic and abdominal aorta, the renal arteries, and the legs (called a "run-off"). A variety of techniques can be used to generate the pictures, such as administration of a [[paramagnetic]] contrast agent ([[gadolinium]]) or using a technique known as "flow-related enhancement" (e.g. 2D and 3D time-of-flight sequences), where most of the signal on an image is due to blood that recently moved into that plane, see also [[FLASH MRI]]. Techniques involving phase accumulation (known as phase contrast angiography) can also be used to generate flow velocity maps easily and accurately. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) is a similar procedure that is used to image veins. In this method, the tissue is now excited inferiorly, while signal is gathered in the plane immediately superior to the excitation plane—thus imaging the venous blood that recently moved from the excited plane.<ref name="haacke">

Magnetic resonance gated intracranial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or liquor dynamics (MR-GILD) technique is an MR sequence based on bipolar gradient pulse used to demonstrate CSF pulsatile flow in ventricles, cisterns, aqueduct of Sylvius and entire intracranial CSF pathway.

====Magnetic resonance spectroscopy====
{{Main|In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy}}
{{Main|Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy}}

[[In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy|Magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (MRS) is used to measure the levels of different [[metabolites]] in body tissues. The MR signal produces a spectrum of resonances that correspond to different molecular arrangements of the isotope being "excited". This signature is used to diagnose certain metabolic disorders, especially those affecting the brain,<ref>

Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) combines both spectroscopic and imaging methods to produce spatially localized spectra from within the sample or patient. The spatial resolution is much lower (limited by the available [[Signal-to-noise ratio|SNR]]), but the spectra in each voxel contains information about many metabolites. Because the available signal is used to encode spatial and spectral information, MRSI requires high SNR achievable only at higher field strengths (3 T and above).

====Functional MRI====
{{Main|Functional magnetic resonance imaging}}
[[Image:FMRI.jpg|thumb|right|A fMRI scan showing regions of activation in orange, including the [[primary visual cortex]] (V1, BA17).]]
[[Functional MRI]] (fMRI) measures signal changes in the [[Human brain|brain]] that are due to changing [[neuron|neural]] activity. The brain is scanned at low resolution but at a rapid rate (typically once every 2–3 seconds). Increases in neural activity cause changes in the MR signal via ''T''{{su|p=*|b=2}} changes;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thulborn KR, Waterton JC, Matthews PM, Radda GK |title=Oxygenation dependence of the transverse relaxation time of water protons in whole blood at high field |journal=Biochim.

Increased neural activity causes an increased demand for oxygen, and the [[blood vessel|vascular]] system actually overcompensates for this, increasing the amount of oxygenated [[hemoglobin]] relative to deoxygenated hemoglobin. Because deoxygenated hemoglobin attenuates the MR signal, the vascular response leads to a signal increase that is related to the neural activity. The precise nature of the relationship between neural activity and the BOLD signal is a subject of current research. The BOLD effect also allows for the generation of high resolution 3D maps of the venous vasculature within neural tissue.

While BOLD signal is the most common method employed for neuroscience studies in human subjects, the flexible nature of MR imaging provides means to sensitize the signal to other aspects of the blood supply. Alternative techniques employ [[arterial spin labeling]] (ASL) or weight the MRI signal by cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV). The CBV method requires injection of a class of MRI contrast agents that are now in human clinical trials. Because this method has been shown to be far more sensitive than the BOLD technique in preclinical studies, it may potentially expand the role of fMRI in clinical applications. The CBF method provides more quantitative information than the BOLD signal, albeit at a significant loss of detection sensitivity.

====Real-time MRI====
[[File:Real-time MRI - Thorax.ogv|thumb|right|Real-time MRI of a [[human heart]] at a resolution of 50 ms]]
{{Main|Real-time MRI}}
[[Real-time MRI]] refers to the continuous monitoring ("filming") of moving objects in real time. While many different strategies have been developed over the past two decades, a recent development reported a real-time MRI technique based on radial [[FLASH MRI|FLASH]] and [[iterative reconstruction]] that yields a temporal resolution of 20 to 30 milliseconds for images with an in-plane resolution of 1.5 to 2.0&nbsp;mm. The new method promises to add important information about diseases of the joints and the heart. In many cases MRI examinations may become easier and more comfortable for patients.

====Interventional MRI====
{{Main|Interventional MRI}}

The lack of harmful effects on the patient and the operator make MRI well-suited for "[[interventional radiology]]", where the images produced by a MRI scanner are used to guide minimally invasive procedures. Of course, such procedures must be done without ''any'' [[ferromagnetic]] instruments.

A specialized growing subset of interventional MRI is that of intraoperative MRI in which the MRI is used in the surgical process. Some specialized MRI systems have been developed that allow imaging concurrent with the surgical procedure. More typical, however, is that the surgical procedure is temporarily interrupted so that MR images can be acquired to verify the success of the procedure or guide subsequent surgical work.

====Radiation therapy simulation====
Because of MRI's superior imaging of soft tissues, it is now being utilized to specifically locate tumors within the body in preparation for radiation therapy treatments. For therapy simulation, a patient is placed in a specific, reproducible, body position and scanned. The MRI system then computes the precise location, shape and orientation of the tumor mass, correcting for any spatial distortion inherent in the system. The patient is then marked or tattooed with points that, when combined with the specific body position, permits precise triangulation for radiation therapy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

====Current density imaging====
[[Current density imaging]] (CDI) endeavors to use the phase information from images to reconstruct current densities within a subject. Current density imaging works because electrical currents generate magnetic fields, which in turn affect the phase of the magnetic dipoles during an imaging sequence.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} These experiences have highlighted the importance of whole body magnetic resonance imaging in early diagnosis of pathologies, because when patients show manifestations through X-ray and CT, their prognosis already may be unfavorable or grim.{{Citation |date=Enero 2012}}

====Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound====
In [[MRgFUS]] therapy, ultrasound beams are focused on a tissue—guided and controlled using MR thermal imaging—and due to the significant energy deposition at the focus, temperature within the tissue rises to more than 65 [[°C]] (150 °F), completely destroying it. This technology can achieve precise [[ablation]] of diseased tissue. MR imaging provides a three-dimensional view of the target tissue, allowing for precise focusing of ultrasound energy. The MR imaging provides quantitative, real-time, thermal images of the treated area. This allows the physician to ensure that the temperature generated during each cycle of ultrasound energy is sufficient to cause thermal ablation within the desired tissue and if not, to adapt the parameters to ensure effective treatment.<ref>H. E. Cline, J. F. Schenck, K. Hynynen, R. D. Watkins, S. P. Souza, and F. A. Jolesz. "MR-guided focused ultrasound surgery," J Comput Assist Tomogr 16(6), 956–65 (1992).</ref>

====Multinuclear imaging====
Hydrogen is the most frequently imaged nucleus in MRI because it is present in biological tissues in great abundance, and because its high gyromagnetic ratio gives a strong signal. However, any nucleus with a net nuclear spin could potentially be imaged with MRI. Such nuclei include [[helium]]-3, [[lithium]]-7, [[carbon]]-13, [[fluorine]]-19, [[oxygen-17]], [[sodium]]-23, [[phosphorus]]-31 and [[xenon]]-129. <sup>23</sup>Na and <sup>31</sup>P are naturally abundant in the body, so can be imaged directly. Gaseous isotopes such as <sup>3</sup>He or <sup>129</sup>Xe must be [[hyperpolarization (physics)|hyperpolarized]] and then inhaled as their nuclear density is too low to yield a useful signal under normal conditions. [[oxygen-17|<sup>17</sup>O]] and <sup>19</sup>F can be administered in sufficient quantities in liquid form (e.g. [[oxygen-17|<sup>17</sup>O]]-water) that hyperpolarization is not a necessity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Multinuclear imaging is primarily a research technique at present. However, potential applications include functional imaging and imaging of organs poorly seen on <sup>1</sup>H MRI (e.g. lungs and bones) or as alternative contrast agents. Inhaled hyperpolarized <sup>3</sup>He can be used to image the distribution of air spaces within the lungs. Injectable solutions containing <sup>13</sup>C or stabilized bubbles of hyperpolarized <sup>129</sup>Xe have been studied as contrast agents for angiography and perfusion imaging. <sup>31</sup>P can potentially provide information on bone density and structure, as well as functional imaging of the brain. Multinuclear imaging holds the potential to chart the distribution of lithium in the human brain, this element finding use an important drug for those with conditions such as bipolar disorder.  {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

====Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI)====
{{Main|Susceptibility weighted imaging}}
Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), is a new type of contrast in MRI different from spin density, ''T''<sub>1</sub>, or ''T''<sub>2</sub> imaging. This method exploits the susceptibility differences between tissues and uses a fully velocity compensated, three dimensional, RF spoiled, high-resolution, 3D gradient echo scan. This special data acquisition and image processing produces an enhanced contrast magnitude image very sensitive to venous blood, [[hemorrhage]] and iron storage. It is used to enhance the detection and diagnosis of tumors, vascular and neurovascular diseases (stroke and hemorrhage, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's), and also detects traumatic brain injuries that may not be diagnosed using other methods<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radiology.rsna.org/content/204/1/272.long|title=Radiology|accessdate=2 August 2010}}{{subscription required}}

Examples of these recent improvements are [[Relaxation (NMR)|''T''{{su|p=*|b=2}}-weighted]] turbo spin-echo (''T''<sub>2</sub> TSE MRI), double inversion recovery MRI (DIR-MRI) or phase-sensitive inversion recovery MRI (PSIR-MRI), all of them able to improve imaging of the brain lesions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wattjes MP, Lutterbey GG, Gieseke J, ''et al.'' |title=Double inversion recovery brain imaging at 3T: Diagnostic value in the detection of multiple sclerosis lesions |journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=54–9 |date=1 January 2007|pmid=17213424 |url=http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17213424 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Nelson F, Poonawalla AH, Hou P, Huang F, Wolinsky JS, Narayana PA |title=Improved identification of intracortical lesions in multiple sclerosis with phase-sensitive inversion recovery in combination with fast double inversion recovery MR imaging |journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=1645–9 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17885241 |doi=10.3174/ajnr.A0645 }}

===Molecular imaging of disease biomarkers by MRI===
{{Main|Molecular imaging}}
MRI has the advantages of having very high spatial resolution and is very adept at morphological imaging and functional imaging.  MRI does have several disadvantages though.  First, MRI has a sensitivity of around 10<sup>−3</sup> [[concentration#Molarity|mol/L]] <!--is this what M was supposed to be, molarity?  if not, explain and link as appropriate--> to 10<sup>−5</sup> mol/L which, compared to other types of imaging, can be very limiting.  This problem stems from the fact that the difference between atoms in the high energy state and the low energy state is very small.  For example, at 1.5 [[tesla (unit)|teslas]], a typical field strength for clinical MRI, the difference between high and low energy states is approximately 9 molecules per 2 million. Improvements to increase MR sensitivity include increasing magnetic field strength, and [[Hyperpolarization (physics)|hyperpolarization]] via optical pumping or dynamic nuclear polarization. There are also a variety of signal amplification schemes based on chemical exchange that increase sensitivity.

To achieve molecular imaging of disease biomarkers using MRI, targeted MRI contrast agents with high specificity and high relaxivity (sensitivity) are required. To date, many studies have been devoted to developing targeted-MRI contrast agents to achieve molecular imaging by MRI. Commonly, peptides, antibodies, or small ligands, and small protein domains, such as HER-2 affibodies, have been applied to achieve targeting. To enhance the sensitivity of the contrast agents, these targeting moieties are usually linked to high payload MRI contrast agents or MRI contrast agents with high relaxivities.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shenghui|first=Xue|coauthors=Jingjuan Qiao, Fan Pu, Mathew Cameron, Jenny J.

===Portable instruments===
Portable magnetic resonance instruments are available for use in education and field research. Using the principles of [[Earth's field NMR]], they have no powerful polarizing magnet, so that such instruments can be small and inexpensive. Some can be used for both EFNMR spectroscopy and MRI imaging.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magritek.com/terranova.html |title=Terranova-MRI Earth's Field MRI teaching system |publisher=Magritek.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-02}}</ref> The low strength of the Earth's field results in poor signal to noise ratios (SNR), requiring long scan times to capture spectroscopic data or build up MRI images. However, the extremely low noise floor of [http://www.freshpatents.com/-dt20110901ptan20110210738.php SQUID-based MRI detectors], and the low density of thermal noise in the low-frequency operating range (tens of kiloHertz) may result in usable SNR approaching that of mid-field conventional instruments. Further, the ultra-low field technologies enable electron spin resonance detection, and potentially imaging, at safe operating frequencies ([http://www.techbriefs.com/component/content/article/6598 NASA Technical Brief]).

===MRI versus CT===
{{copy edit-section|date=February 2013}}
The use of [[X-ray]]s, a type of [[ionizing radiation]], by a [[computed tomography]] (CT) allows for examination of tissues composed of elements of a higher atomic number than the surrounding tissues.

Since CT scans use ionizing radiation (X-rays) to produce images, there is a risk of damage to [[DNA]] that can subsequently cause [[cancer]]. In 2007, it was estimated that 0.4% of current cancers in the United States are due to CTs performed in the past, although in the future this may increase to as high as 1.5–2% based on past rates of CT usage.<ref name="Brenner2007">{{cite journal |author=Brenner DJ, Hall EJ |title=Computed tomography—an increasing source of radiation exposure |journal=N.

Contrast in CT images is generated purely by X-ray attenuation, while a variety of properties may be used to generate contrast in MR images. By variation of scanning parameters, tissue contrast can be altered to enhance different features in an image (see [[#Applications|Applications]] for more details). Both CT and MR images may be enhanced by the use of [[contrast medium|contrast agents]]. Contrast agents for CT contain elements of a high atomic number relative to tissue, such as [[iodine]] or [[barium]], while contrast agents (such as [[gadolinium]] and [[manganese]]) for MRI have [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] properties that are used to alter tissue [[Relaxation (NMR)|relaxation]] times.  Commonly used [[MRI contrast agent]]s may be contraindicated in people with significant permanent or transient kidney dysfunction.<ref name=ACR-NSF>{{cite web|title=Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis|url=http://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/PDF/QualitySafety/Resources/Contrast%20Manual/Nephrogenic%20Systemic%20Fibrosis.pdf|work=ACR Manual on Contrast Material|publisher=American College of Radiology|accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref>

CT and MRI scanners are able to generate multiple two-dimensional cross-sections (tomographs, or "slices") of tissue and three-dimensional reconstructions.
MRI can generate cross-sectional images in any [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] (including oblique planes). In the past, CT was limited to acquiring images in the [[Transverse plane|axial plane]] (or near axial), and so the images were called Computed ''Axial'' Tomography scans (CAT scans). However, the development of multi-detector CT scanners with near-[[isotropy|isotropic]] resolution allows the CT scanner to produce data that can be retrospectively reconstructed in any plane with minimal loss of image quality. For purposes of tumor detection and identification in the brain, MRI is generally superior.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The clinical and radiological evaluation of primary brain neoplasms in children, Part II: Radiological evaluation|author=Allen ED, Byrd SE, Darling CF, Tomita T, Wilczynski MA.|year=1993|journal=J Natl Med Assoc.|volume=85|issue=7|pages=546–53|pmid=8350377|pmc=2568155}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Computed tomography versus magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.

Furthermore, CT usually is more widely available, faster, and less expensive. 

MRI is also best suited for cases when a patient is to undergo several exams in the short term, since it does not expose the patient to the hazards of ionizing radiation.  However MRI is usually contraindicated if the patient has any type of medical implant, such as vagus nerve stimulators, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, loop recorders, insulin pumps, cochlear implants, deep brain stimulators, metallic foreign bodies (e.g. shrapnel or shell fragments), or metallic implants such as surgical prostheses. These devices can malfunction or heat up during an MRI scan, so CT scans are considered the safer option for these patients.

===Economics of MRI===
Standard 1.5 tesla MRI  scanners used to cost between {{USD|1 million}} and {{USD|1.5 million}}. Standard 3.0 tesla MRI scanners would often cost between {{USD|2 million}} and {{USD|2.3 million}}. Construction of MRI suites could cost up to {{USD|500,000}}, or more, depending on project scope. PMRI scanners today now cost a great deal less, around {{USD|50,000}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-mrsrl.stanford.edu/research.html |title=Research Areas: Prepolarized MRI for Imaging Near Metal Implants |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |accessdate=26 April 2012 |quote=Prepolarized MRI is a novel method of MRI that uses two inexpensive electromagnets to make an MRI study of the human body.

MRI scanners have been significant sources of revenue for healthcare providers in the US. This is because of favorable reimbursement rates from insurers and federal government programs. Insurance reimbursement is provided in two components, an equipment charge for the actual performance of the MRI scan and professional charge for the radiologist's review of the images and/or data.  In the US Northeast, an equipment charge might be $3,500 and a professional charge might be $350 <ref>Stamford Hospital price quotation October 2008, Stamford CT US</ref> although the actual fees received by the equipment owner and interpreting physician are often significantly less and depend on the rates negotiated with insurance companies or determined by the Medicare Fee Schedule. For example, an orthopedic surgery group in Illinois billed a charge of $1,116 for a knee MRI in 2007 but the Medicare reimbursement in 2007 was only $470.91.<ref>Gordon AC, et al "Over-utilization of MRI in the osteoarthritis patient" AAOS meeting 2008; P145.</ref>  Many insurance companies require preapproval of an MRI procedure as a condition for coverage.

In the US, the [[Deficit Reduction Act of 2005]] significantly reduced reimbursement rates paid by federal insurance programs for the equipment component of many scans, shifting the economic landscape. Many private insurers have followed suit.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In the United States, an MRI of the brain with and without contrast billed to Medicare Part B entails, on average, a technical payment of {{USD|403}} and a separate payment to the radiologist of {{USD|93}}.<ref>[[Current Procedural Terminology]] code #70553 [https://explore.data.gov/Health-and-Nutrition/Part-B-National-Summary-Data-File-CY2010/5vgw-8z3q "2010 Medicare Part B National Summary Data File"]. Data.gov, An Official Website of the United States Government.</ref>  In France, the cost of an MRI exam is approximately 150 Euros. This covers three basic scans including one with an intravenous contrast agent, as well as a consultation with the technician and a written report to the patient's physician. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}  In Japan, the cost of a MRI examination (excluding the cost of contrast material and films) ranges from {{USD|155}} to {{USD|180}}, with an additional radiologist professional fee of {{USD|17}}.<ref>Ehara S, Nakajima Y, Matsui O.

==Safety==
A number of features of MRI scanning can give rise to risks.

These include:
* Powerful magnetic fields
* Radio waves
* Cryogenic liquids
* Noise
* Claustrophobia.

In addition, in cases where [[MRI contrast agent]]s are used, these also typically have associated risks.

===Use when indicated===
Medical societies issue guidelines for when physicians should use MRI on patients, and recommend against overuse. MRI can detect health problems or confirm a diagnosis, but often medical societies recommend that MRI not be the first procedure for creating a plan to diagnose or manage a patient's complaint. A common case is the use of MRI to seek a cause of [[low back pain]]; the [[American College of Physicians]], for example, recommends against this for being unlikely to result in a positive outcome for the patient.<ref name="ACPfive">{{Citation |author1 = Consumer Reports |author2 = American College of Physicians |author1-link = Consumer Reports |author2-link = American College of Physicians |others = presented by [[ABIM Foundation]] |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[Consumer Reports]] |work = Choosing Wisely |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_College_Phys.pdf |accessdate = August 14, 2012}}</ref><ref name="backimage">{{Citation |author1 = Consumer Reports |author2 = American College of Physicians |author1-link = Consumer Reports |author2-link = American College of Physicians |others = presented by ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' |date = April 2012 |title = Imaging tests for lower-back pain: Why you probably don’t need them. |publisher = [[Consumer Reports]] |work = High Value Care |page = |url = http://consumerhealthchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/High-Value-Care-Back-Pain-ACP.pdf |accessdate = August 14, 2012}}</ref>

Some types of medical implants are generally considered [[contraindication]]s for MRI examinations, while others may be acceptable for patients under high specific MRI conditions. Patients are therefore always asked for complete information about all implants before entering the room for an MRI scan. Several deaths have been reported in patients with pacemakers who have undergone MRI scanning without appropriate precautions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Physics of magnetic resonance imaging|url=http://www.my-ms.org/mri_physics.htm|publisher=My-MS.org|accessdate=27 April 2012}}</ref> To reduce such risks, implants are increasingly being developed to make them able to be safely scanned,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn3771 |title=Nano-coated implants cut MRI scan dangers – 01 June 2003 |publisher=New Scientist |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref> and specialized protocols have been developed to permit the safe scanning of selected implants and pacing devices. [[Cardiovascular stent]]s are considered safe, however.<ref>{{cite pmid|    10762825}}</ref>

[[Ferromagnetic]] foreign bodies such as [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] fragments, or metallic implants such as [[surgical prosthetics|surgical prostheses]] and ferromagnetic [[aneurysm]] clips are also potential risks. Interaction of the magnetic and radio frequency fields with such objects can lead to trauma due to movement of the object in the magnetic field or thermal injury from radio-frequency [[induction heating]] of the object.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magnetic resonance safety policy of ucsf|url=http://www.radiology.ucsf.edu/patient-care/patient-safety/mri/policy|publisher=University of California, San Francisco|accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref>

[[Titanium]] and its alloys are safe from movement from the magnetic field.

In the [[United States]] a classification system for implants and ancillary clinical devices has been developed by ASTM International and is now the standard supported by the US Food and Drug Administration:

* ''MR-Safe''&nbsp;— The device or implant is completely non-magnetic, non-electrically conductive, and non-RF reactive, eliminating all of the primary potential threats during an MRI procedure.
* ''MR-Conditional''&nbsp;— A device or implant that may contain magnetic, electrically conductive or RF-reactive components that is safe for operations in proximity to the MRI, provided the conditions for safe operation are defined and observed (such as 'tested safe to 1.5 teslas' or 'safe in magnetic fields below 500 gauss in strength').
* ''MR-Unsafe''&nbsp;— Nearly self-explanatory, this category is reserved for objects that are significantly ferromagnetic and pose a clear and direct threat to persons and equipment within the magnet room.

The very high strength of the magnetic field can also cause "missile-effect" accidents, where ferromagnetic objects are attracted to the center of the magnet, and there have been incidences of injury and death.<ref name="nyt-fat">Randal C.

===Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS)===
The rapid switching on and off of the magnetic field gradients is capable of causing nerve stimulation. Volunteers report a twitching sensation when exposed to rapidly switched fields, particularly in their extremities.<ref>

}}</ref> Although PNS was not a problem for the slow, weak gradients used in the early days of MRI, the strong, rapidly switched gradients used in techniques such as EPI, fMRI, diffusion MRI, etc. are indeed capable of inducing PNS. American and European regulatory agencies insist that manufacturers stay below specified ''d'''''B'''/''dt'' limits (''d'''''B'''/''dt'' is the change in field per unit time) or else prove that no PNS is induced for any imaging sequence. As a result of ''d'''''B'''/''dt'' limitation, commercial MRI systems cannot use the full rated power of their gradient amplifiers.

===Heating caused by absorption of radio waves===
Every MRI scanner has a powerful radio transmitter to generate the electromagnetic field which excites the spins. If the body absorbes the energy, heating occurs. For this reason, the rate at which energy is absorbed by the body has to be limited (see [[Specific absorption rate]]).

===Acoustic noise===
Switching of [[#Gradients|field gradients]] causes a change in the [[Lorentz force]] experienced by the gradient coils, producing minute expansions and contractions of the coil itself. As the switching is typically in the audible frequency range, the resulting vibration produces loud noises (clicking or beeping). This is most marked with high-field machines<ref name=Evolution>[http://www.eradimaging.com/site/article.cfm?ID=426 "The Evolution of Magnetic Resonance Imaging: 3T MRI in Clinical Applications"], Terry Duggan-Jahns, www.eradimaging.com</ref> and rapid-imaging techniques in which sound pressure levels can reach 120 [[A-weighted|dB(A)]] (equivalent to a jet engine at take-off),<ref>

===Cryogens===
As described in [[Physics of Magnetic Resonance Imaging#Scanner construction and operation|Physics of Magnetic Resonance Imaging]], many MRI scanners rely on cryogenic liquids to enable superconducting capabilities of the electromagnetic coils within. Though the cryogenic liquids used are non-toxic, their physical properties present specific hazards.

An unintentional shut-down of a [[superconducting magnet|superconducting electromagnet]], an event known as "quench", involves the rapid boiling of liquid [[helium]] from the device. If the rapidly expanding helium cannot be dissipated through an external vent, sometimes referred to as 'quench pipe', it may be released into the scanner room where it may cause displacement of the oxygen and present a risk of [[asphyxiation]].<ref>''{{cite journal |author=Kanal E, Barkovich AJ, Bell C, ''et al.'' |title=ACR Guidance Document for Safe MR Practices: 2007 |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol. |volume=188 |issue= 6|pages=1–27 |year=2007 |doi=10.2214/AJR.06.1616 |url=http://www.acr.org/SecondaryMainMenuCategories/quality_safety/MRSafety/safe_mr07.aspx {{dead link|date=December 2012}}|pmid=17515363}} page 22.</ref>

Oxygen deficiency monitors are usually used as a safety precaution. Liquid [[helium]], the most commonly used cryogen in MRI, undergoes near explosive expansion as it changes from liquid to a gaseous state. The use of an oxygen monitor is important to ensure that oxygen levels are safe for patient/physicians. Rooms built in support of superconducting MRI equipment should be equipped with pressure relief mechanisms<ref>[[International Electrotechnical Commission]] 2008: ''Medical Electrical Equipment – Part 2-33: Particular requirements for basic safety and essential performance of magnetic resonance equipment for medical diagnosis'', manufacturers' trade standards ''[http://webstore.iec.ch/Webstore/webstore.nsf/0/EC11496F487C406DC125742C000B2805]'', published by [[International Electrotechnical Commission]], ISBN 2-8318-9626-6 (can be found for purchase at [http://webstore.iec.ch/Webstore/webstore.nsf/0/EC11496F487C406DC125742C000B2805]).</ref> and an exhaust fan, in addition to the required quench pipe.

Because a quench results in rapid loss of [[cryogen]]s from the magnet, recommissioning the magnet is expensive and time-consuming. Spontaneous quenches are uncommon, but a quench may also be triggered by an equipment malfunction, improper cryogen fill technique, contaminants inside the cryostat, or extreme magnetic or vibrational disturbances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.falckproductions.com/resources/mri-safety/cryogen-awareness-quenching-and-your-mri-machine/|title=Cryogen Awareness Quenching and MRI Safety Training|publisher=Falck Productions|accessdate=10 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gehealthcare.com/usen/mr/docs/SPV8_Avoiding_Quench.pdf|title=GE Health Care|publisher=GE|accessdate=10 July 2012}}</ref>

===Contrast agents===
<!-- this subsection is the target of a link in [[Gadolinium#Applications]] -->
{{Main|MRI contrast agent}}
The most commonly used intravenous contrast agents are based on [[chelate]]s of [[gadolinium]]. In general, these agents have proved safer than the iodinated contrast agents used in X-ray radiography or CT. [[Anaphylaxis|Anaphylactoid reactions]] are rare, occurring in approx. 0.03–0.1%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Murphy KJ, Brunberg JA, Cohan RH |title=Adverse reactions to gadolinium contrast media: A review of 36 cases |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=167 |issue=4 |pages=847–9 |date=1 October 1996|pmid=8819369 |url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8819369 }}</ref> Of particular interest is the lower incidence of nephrotoxicity, compared with iodinated agents, when given at usual doses—this has made contrast-enhanced MRI scanning an option for patients with renal impairment, who would otherwise not be able to undergo [[Radiocontrast|contrast-enhanced CT]].<ref>"[http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?doc_id=8283 ACR guideline], 2005"</ref>

Although gadolinium agents have proved useful for patients with renal impairment, in patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis there is a risk of a rare but serious illness, [[nephrogenic systemic fibrosis]], that may be linked to the use of certain gadolinium-containing agents. The most frequently linked is gadodiamide, but other agents have been linked too.<ref>{{cite journal | author=H.S. Thomsen, S.K. Morcos and P.

In particular, MRI avoids the use of [[ionizing radiation]], to which the fetus is particularly sensitive. However, as a precaution, current guidelines recommend that pregnant women undergo MRI only when essential. This is particularly the case during the first trimester of pregnancy, as [[organogenesis]] takes place during this period. The concerns in pregnancy are the same as for MRI in general, but the fetus may be more sensitive to the effects—particularly to heating and to noise. However, one additional concern is the use of contrast agents; [[gadolinium]] compounds are known to cross the placenta and enter the fetal bloodstream, and it is recommended that their use be avoided.

Despite these concerns, MRI is rapidly growing in importance as a way of diagnosing and monitoring [[congenital defect]]s of the fetus because it can provide more diagnostic information than [[ultrasound]] and it lacks the ionizing radiation of CT. MRI without contrast agents is the imaging mode of choice for pre-surgical, in-utero diagnosis and evaluation of fetal tumors, primarily [[teratoma]]s, facilitating open [[fetal surgery]], other [[fetal intervention]]s, and planning for procedures (such as the [[EXIT procedure]]) to safely deliver and treat babies whose defects would otherwise be fatal.

===Claustrophobia and discomfort===
Despite being painless, MRI scans can be unpleasant for those who are claustrophobic or otherwise uncomfortable with the imaging device surrounding them. Older closed bore MRI systems have a fairly long tube or tunnel. The part of the body being imaged must lie at the center of the magnet, which is at the absolute center of the tunnel. Because scan times on these older scanners may be long (occasionally up to 40 minutes for the entire procedure), people with even mild claustrophobia are sometimes unable to tolerate an MRI scan without management. Some modern scanners have larger bores (up to 70&nbsp;cm) and scan times are shorter. This means that claustrophobia could be less of an issue, and additional patients may now find MRI to be a tolerable procedure.

Nervous patients may still find the following strategies helpful:

*Advance preparation
**visiting the scanner to see the room and practice lying on the table
**visualization techniques
**chemical sedation
**[[general anesthesia]]
*Coping while inside the scanner
**having a loved one in the room to hold hand, reassure them, etc.
**holding a "panic button"
**closing eyes as well as covering them (e.g. washcloth, eye mask)


Many newer MRI systems place a diagonal mirror above the eyes to allow the patient to look down the tunnel rather than at the bore wall immediately above their face.

Alternative scanner designs, such as open or upright systems, can also be helpful where these are available. Though open scanners have increased in popularity, they produce inferior scan quality because they operate at lower magnetic fields than closed scanners. However, commercial 1.5 [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] open systems have recently become available, providing much better image quality than previous lower field strength open models.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medical.siemens.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/PressReleaseView~q_catalogId~e_-1~a_catTree~e_100005,13839,17712~a_langId~e_-1~a_pageId~e_50677~a_storeId~e_10001.htm |title=Siemens Introduces First 1.5 Tesla Open Bore MRI |publisher=Medical.siemens.com |date=2004-07-29 |accessdate=2010-08-02}}</ref>

For babies and other young children chemical sedation or general anesthesia are the norm, as these subjects cannot be instructed to hold still during the scanning session. Obese patients and pregnant women may find the MRI machine to be a tight fit. Pregnant women may also have difficulty lying on their backs for an hour or more without moving.

===Guidance===
Safety issues, including the potential for biostimulation device interference, movement of ferromagnetic bodies, and incidental localized heating, have been addressed in the [[American College of Radiology]]'s ''White Paper on MR Safety,'' which was originally published in 2002 and expanded in 2004. The ''ACR White Paper on MR Safety'' has been rewritten and was released early in 2007 under the new title [http://www.acr.org/SecondaryMainMenuCategories/quality_safety/MRSafety/safe_mr07.aspx ''ACR Guidance Document for Safe MR Practices''].<br />
In December 2007, the Medicines in Healthcare product Regulation Agency (MHRA), a UK healthcare regulatory body, issued their [http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dDocName=CON2033065&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased ''Safety Guidelines for Magnetic Resonance Imaging Equipment in Clinical Use''].<br />
In February 2008, the [[Joint Commission]], a US healthcare accrediting organization, issued a [http://www.jointcommission.org/SentinelEvents/SentinelEventAlert/sea_38.htm Sentinel Event Alert #38], their highest patient safety advisory, on MRI safety issues.<br />
In July 2008, the United States Veterans Administration, a federal governmental agency serving the healthcare needs of former military personnel, issued a substantial revision to their ''MRI Design Guide'',<ref>{{cite web

===The European Physical Agents Directive===
The European Physical Agents (Electromagnetic Fields) Directive is legislation adopted in European legislature. Originally scheduled to be required by the end of 2008, each individual state within the European Union must include this directive in its own law by the end of 2012. Some member nations passed complying legislation and are now attempting to repeal their state laws in expectation that the final version of the EU Physical Agents Directive will be substantially revised prior to the revised adoption date.

The directive applies to occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields (not medical exposure) and was intended to limit workers’ acute exposure to strong electromagnetic fields, as may be found near electricity substations, radio or television transmitters or industrial equipment. However, the regulations impact significantly on MRI, with separate sections of the regulations limiting exposure to static magnetic fields, changing magnetic fields and radio frequency energy. Field strength limits are given, which may not be exceeded. An employer may commit a criminal offense by allowing a worker to exceed an exposure limit, if that is how the Directive is implemented in a particular member state.

The Directive is based on the international consensus of established effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields, and in particular the advice of the European Commissions's advisor, the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). The aims of the Directive, and the ICNIRP guidelines it is based on, are to prevent exposure to potentially harmful fields. The actual limits in the Directive are very similar to the limits advised by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, with the exception of the frequencies produced by the gradient coils, where the IEEE limits are significantly higher.

Many Member States of the EU already have either specific EMF regulations or (as in the UK) a general requirement under workplace health and safety legislation to protect workers against electromagnetic fields. In almost all cases the existing regulations are aligned with the ICNIRP limits so that the Directive should, in theory, have little impact on any employer already meeting their legal responsibilities.

The introduction of the Directive has brought to light an existing potential issue with occupational exposures to MRI fields. There are at present very few data on the number or types of MRI practice that might lead to exposures in excess of the levels of the Directive.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bassen, H; Schaefer, D J. ; Zaremba, L; Bushberg, J; Ziskin, M [S]; Foster, K R.|title=IEEE Committee on Man and Radiation (COMAR) technical information statement "Exposure of medical personnel to electromagnetic fields from open magnetic resonance imaging systems" |journal=Health Physics |year=2005 |volume=89 |issue=6 |pages=684–9 |doi=10.1097/01.HP.0000172545.71238.15|pmid=16282801}}</ref><ref>HSE 2007,[http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/rrpdf/rr570.pdf RR570:Assessment of electromagnetic fields around magnetic resonance (MRI) equipment]. MCL-T Ltd, London</ref> There is a justifiable concern amongst MRI practitioners that if the Directive were to be enforced more vigorously than existing legislation, the use of MRI might be restricted, or working practices of MRI personnel might have to change.

In the initial draft a limit of static field strength to 2 T was given. This has since been removed from the regulations, and whilst it is unlikely to be restored as it was without a strong justification, some restriction on static fields may be reintroduced after the matter has been considered more fully by ICNIRP. The effect of such a limit might be to restrict the installation, operation and maintenance of MRI scanners with magnets of 2 T and stronger. As the increase in field strength has been instrumental in developing higher resolution and higher performance scanners, this would be a significant step back. This is why it is unlikely to happen without strong justification.

Individual government agencies and the European Commission have now formed a working group to examine the implications on MRI and to try to address the issue of occupational exposures to electromagnetic fields from MRI.

===Work by Dr. Raymond Vahan Damadian on MRI===
[[Image:Damadian invention.jpg|thumb|right|Raymond Damadian's "Apparatus and method for detecting cancer in tissue."]]

In a 1971 paper  in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'',<ref>{{cite journal |author=Damadian RV |title=Tumor Detection by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance |journal=Science |volume=171 |pages=1151–3 |year=1971 |month=March |doi=10.1126/science.171.3976.1151 |pmid=5544870 |issue=3976|bibcode = 1971Sci...171.1151D }}</ref> SUNY Downstate Medical Center professor Dr. [[Raymond Vahan Damadian ]] reported that [[tumor]]s and normal tissue can be distinguished in vitro by [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] ("NMR"). He suggested that these differences could be used to diagnose [[cancer]], though later research found these differences, while real, too variable for diagnostic purposes. Damadian's initial methods were flawed for practical use,<ref name="SydneyMorningHerald">{{cite news | title = The man who did not win | date = 2003-10-17 | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/10/16/1065917548433.html | publisher = ''Sydney Morning Herald'' | accessdate = 2007-08-04 }}</ref> relying on a point-by-point scan of the entire body and using relaxation rates, which turned out to not be an effective indicator of cancerous tissue.<ref name="wallstjournal">{{cite news | title = Scan and Deliver | date = 2002-06-14 | url = http://opinionjournal.com/taste/?id=110001844l | publisher = ''Wall Street Journal'' | accessdate = 2007-08-04 }}</ref> Nonetheless, in 1974, he received the first patent in the field of MRI when he patented the concept of NMR<ref>{{US patent|3789832}}</ref> for detecting cancer after filing an application in 1972.

===First human MRI exam===
On July 3, 1977, '''the first MRI exam ever performed on a human being''' took place. It took almost five hours to produce one image. The images were, by today's standards, primitive. Dr. [[Raymond Vahan Damadian|Raymond Damadian]], a physician and scientist, along with colleagues Dr. [[Larry Minkoff]] and Dr. [[Michael Goldsmith]], labored tirelessly for seven long years to reach this point. They named their original machine "Indomitable" to capture the spirit of their struggle to do what many said could not be done.

This machine is now in the Smithsonian Institution. As late as 1983, there were only a handful of MRI scanners in the entire United States. Today there are thousands. We can image in seconds what used to take hours. Yeah! <ref>{{cite book|last=frank|first=emily|title=conc}}</ref> <ref>MRI</ref>
