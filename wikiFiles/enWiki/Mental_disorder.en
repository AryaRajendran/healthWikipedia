A '''mental disorder''' or '''mental illness''' is a [[Psychology|psychological]] pattern or [[abnormality (behavior)|anomaly]], potentially reflected in [[behavior]], that is generally associated with [[suffering|distress]] or [[disability]], and which is not considered part of [[normality (behaviour)|normal]] [[developmental psychology|development]] in a person's [[culture]]. Mental disorders are generally defined by a combination of how a person [[affective|feels]], [[behavioral|acts]], [[cognitive|thinks]] or [[perceptual|perceives]]. This may be associated with particular regions or functions of the [[human brain|brain]] or rest of the [[nervous system]], often in a [[society|social context]]. The recognition and understanding of [[mental health]] conditions have changed over time and across cultures and there are still variations in definition, assessment and [[classification of mental disorders|classification]], although standard guideline criteria are widely used. In many cases, there appears to be a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] between mental health and mental illness, making diagnosis complex.<ref>The United States Department of Health and Human Services. Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General. "Chapter 2: The Fundamentals of Mental Health and Mental Illness." pp 39 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/psych205-2.2.pdf] Retrieved May 21, 2012</ref> According to the [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO), over a third of people in most countries report problems at some time in their life which meet criteria for diagnosis of one or more of the common types of mental disorder.<ref name="WHOICPE">WHO International Consortium in Psychiatric Epidemiology (2000) [http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0042-96862000000400003&lng=&nrm=iso Cross-national comparisons of the prevalences and correlates of mental disorders], ''Bulletin of the World Health Organization'' v.78 n.4</ref>

The [[causes of mental disorders]] are varied and in some cases unclear, and theories may incorporate findings from a range of fields. [[Services for mental disorders|Services]] are based in [[psychiatric hospitals]] or in the [[community mental health services|community]], and assessments are carried out by [[psychiatrists]], [[clinical psychologists]] and [[social work|clinical social workers]], using various methods but often relying on observation and questioning. Clinical treatments are provided by various [[mental health professionals]]. [[Psychotherapy]] and [[psychiatric medication]] are two major treatment options, as are [[social work|social]] interventions, [[peer support]] and [[self-help]]. In a minority of cases there might be [[involuntary commitment|involuntary detention]] or [[involuntary treatment]], where legislation allows. [[Social stigma|Stigma]] and [[mentalism (discrimination)|discrimination]] can add to the suffering and disability associated with mental disorders (or with being diagnosed or judged as having a mental disorder), leading to various [[social movements]] attempting to increase understanding and challenge [[social exclusion]]. Prevention is now appearing in some mental health strategies.

==Classifications==
{{Main|Classification of mental disorders}}
The definition and classification of mental disorders is a key issue for researchers as well as service providers and those who may be diagnosed. Most international clinical documents use the term mental "disorder", while "illness" is also common. It has been noted that using the term "mental" (i.e., of the [[mind]]) is not necessarily meant to imply separateness from [[brain]] or [[body]].

There are currently two widely established systems that classify mental disorders—''[[ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders]]'', since 1949 part of the [[International Classification of Diseases]] produced by the WHO, and the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-IV) produced by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) since 1952.

Both list categories of disorder and provide standardized criteria for diagnosis. They have deliberately converged their codes in recent revisions so that the manuals are often broadly comparable, although significant differences remain. Other classification schemes may be used in non-western cultures, for example the ''[[Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders]]'', and other manuals may be used by those of alternative theoretical persuasions, for example the ''[[Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual]]''. In general, mental disorders are classified separately from [[neurological disorders]], [[learning disabilities]] or [[mental retardation]].

Unlike the DSM and ICD, some approaches are not based on identifying distinct categories of disorder using [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] symptom profiles intended to separate the abnormal from the normal. There is significant scientific debate about the relative merits of categorical versus such non-categorical (or hybrid) schemes, also known as [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] or dimensional models. A [[spectrum approach]] may incorporate elements of both.

In the scientific and academic literature on the definition or classification of mental disorder, one extreme argues that it is entirely a matter of value judgements (including of what is [[norm (sociology)|norm]]al) while another proposes that it is or could be entirely [[objectivity (science)|objective]] and [[scientific]] (including by reference to statistical norms).<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Berrios G E |title=Classifications in psychiatry: a conceptual history |journal=Aust N Z J Psychiatry |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=145–60 |date=April 1999|pmid=10336212 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0004-8674&date=1999&volume=33&issue=2&spage=145 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-1614.1999.00555.x}}</ref> Common hybrid views argue that the concept of mental disorder is objective even if only a "fuzzy [[prototype]]" that can never be precisely defined, or conversely that the concept always involves a mixture of scientific facts and subjective value judgments.<ref>Perring, C. (2005) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-illness/ Mental Illness] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref> Although the diagnostic categories are referred to as 'disorders', they are presented as medical diseases, but are not validated in the same way as most medical diagnoses. Some neurologists argue that classification will only be reliable and valid when based on neurobiological features rather than clinical interview, while others suggest that the differing ideological and practical perspectives need to be better integrated.<ref name=Katsching>{{cite journal|last=Katsching|first=Heinz|title=Are psychiatrists an endangered species?

===Disorders===
{{see also|List of mental disorders as defined by the DSM and ICD}}
There are many different categories of mental disorder, and many different facets of human behavior and personality that can become disordered.<ref name=Gazzaniga>Gazzaniga, M.S., & Heatherton, T.F.

[[Anxiety]] or [[fear]] that interferes with normal functioning may be classified as an [[anxiety disorder]].<ref name=webMD_types>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-types-illness |title=Mental Health: Types of Mental Illness |accessdate=2009-09-29 |publisher=[[WebMD]] }}</ref> Commonly recognized categories include specific [[phobia]]s, [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[social anxiety disorder]], [[panic disorder]], [[agoraphobia]], [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].

Other affective (emotion/mood) processes can also become disordered. [[Mood disorder]] involving unusually intense and sustained sadness, melancholia, or despair is known as [[major depression]] (also known as unipolar or clinical depression). Milder but still prolonged depression can be diagnosed as [[dysthymia]]. [[Bipolar disorder]] (also known as manic depression) involves abnormally "high" or pressured mood states, known as [[mania]] or [[hypomania]], alternating with normal or depressed mood. The extent to which unipolar and bipolar mood phenomena represent distinct categories of disorder, or mix and merge along a dimension or spectrum of mood, is subject to some scientific debate.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Akiskal HS, Benazzi F |title=The DSM-IV and ICD-10 categories of recurrent [major] depressive and bipolar II disorders: evidence that they lie on a dimensional spectrum |journal=J Affect Disord |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=45–54 |date=May 2006|pmid=16488021 |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2005.12.035 }}</ref>

Patterns of belief, language use and perception of reality can become disordered (e.g., [[delusions]], [[thought disorder]], [[hallucinations]]). [[Psychotic disorder]]s in this domain include [[schizophrenia]], and [[delusional disorder]]. [[Schizoaffective disorder]] is a category used for individuals showing aspects of both schizophrenia and affective disorders. [[Schizotypy]] is a category used for individuals showing some of the characteristics associated with schizophrenia but without meeting cutoff criteria.

[[Personality development|Personality]]—the fundamental characteristics of a person that influence thoughts and behaviors across situations and time—may be considered disordered if judged to be abnormally rigid and [[maladaptive]]. Although treated separately by some, the commonly used categorical schemes include them as mental disorders, albeit on a separate "[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#Multi axial system|axis&nbsp;II]]" in the case of the DSM-IV. A number of different [[personality disorder]]s are listed, including those sometimes classed as "eccentric", such as [[paranoid personality disorder|paranoid]], [[schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]] and [[schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] personality disorders; types that have described as "dramatic" or "emotional", such as [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]], [[histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] or [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] personality disorders; and those sometimes classed as fear-related, such as [[avoidant personality disorder|anxious-avoidant]], [[dependent personality disorder|dependent]], or [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder|obsessive-compulsive]] personality disorders. The personality disorders in general are defined as emerging in childhood, or at least by adolescence or early adulthood. The ICD also has a category for enduring personality change after a catastrophic experience or psychiatric illness. If an inability to sufficiently adjust to life circumstances begins within three months of a particular event or situation, and ends within six months after the stressor stops or is eliminated, it may instead be classed as an [[adjustment disorder]]. There is an emerging consensus that so-called "personality disorders", like personality traits in general, actually incorporate a mixture of acute dysfunctional behaviors that may resolve in short periods, and maladaptive temperamental traits that are more enduring.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clark LA |title=Assessment and diagnosis of personality disorder: perennial issues and an emerging reconceptualization |journal=Annu Rev Psychol |volume=58 |pages=227–57 |year=2007 |pmid=16903806 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190200 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190200}}</ref> Furthermore, there are also non-categorical schemes that rate all individuals via a profile of different dimensions of personality without a symptom-based cutoff from normal personality variation, for example through schemes based on dimensional models.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Morey LC, Hopwood CJ, Gunderson JG, ''et al.'' |title=Comparison of alternative models for personality disorders |journal=Psychol Med |volume=37 |issue=7 |pages=983–94 |date=July 2007|pmid=17121690 |doi=10.1017/S0033291706009482 }}</ref>

[[Eating disorder]]s involve disproportionate concern in matters of food and weight.<ref name=webMD_types /> Categories of disorder in this area include [[anorexia nervosa]], [[bulimia nervosa]], [[exercise bulimia]] or [[binge eating disorder]].

[[Sleep disorder]]s such as [[insomnia]] involve disruption to normal [[sleep]] patterns, or a feeling of tiredness despite sleep appearing normal.

[[Sexual disorder|Sexual]] and gender identity disorders may be diagnosed, including [[dyspareunia]], [[gender identity disorder]] and [[egodystonic sexual orientation|ego-dystonic homosexuality]]. Various kinds of [[paraphilia]] are considered mental disorders (sexual arousal to objects, situations, or individuals that are considered abnormal or harmful to the person or others).

People who are abnormally unable to resist certain urges or impulses that could be harmful to themselves or others, may be classed as having an impulse control disorder, including various kinds of [[tic disorders]] such as [[Tourette's syndrome]], and disorders such as [[kleptomania]] (stealing) or [[pyromania]] (fire-setting). Various behavioral addictions, such as [[gambling]] addiction, may be classed as a disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder can sometimes involve an inability to resist certain acts but is classed separately as being primarily an anxiety disorder.

The use of drugs (legal or illegal, including [[alcohol]]), when it persists despite significant problems related to its use, may be defined as a mental disorder. The DSM incorporates such conditions under the umbrella category of [[substance use disorders]], which includes [[substance dependence]] and [[substance abuse]]. The DSM does not currently use the common term drug addiction, and the ICD simply refers to "harmful use". Disordered substance use may be due to a pattern of compulsive and repetitive use of the drug that results in tolerance to its effects and withdrawal symptoms when use is reduced or stopped.

People who suffer severe disturbances of their self-identity, memory and general awareness of themselves and their surroundings may be classed as having a [[dissociative identity disorder]], such as [[depersonalization disorder]] or Dissociative Identity Disorder itself (which has also been called multiple personality disorder, or "split personality"). Other memory or cognitive disorders include [[amnesia]] or various kinds of old age [[dementia]].

A range of [[developmental disorders]] that initially occur in childhood may be diagnosed, for example [[autism spectrum]] disorders, [[oppositional defiant disorder]] and [[conduct disorder]], and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), which may continue into adulthood.

Conduct disorder, if continuing into adulthood, may be diagnosed as [[antisocial personality disorder]] (dissocial personality disorder in the ICD). Popularist labels such as [[psychopath]] (or sociopath) do not appear in the DSM or ICD but are linked by some to these diagnoses.

Somatoform disorders may be diagnosed when there are problems that appear to originate in the body that are thought to be manifestations of a mental disorder. This includes [[somatization disorder]] and [[conversion disorder]]. There are also disorders of how a person perceives their body, such as [[body dysmorphic disorder]]. [[Neurasthenia]] is an old diagnosis involving somatic complaints as well as fatigue and low spirits/depression, which is officially recognized by the ICD-10 but no longer by the DSM-IV.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Gamma A, Angst J, Ajdacic V, Eich D, Rössler W |title=The spectra of neurasthenia and depression: course, stability and transitions |journal=Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci |volume=257 |issue=2 |pages=120–7 |date=March 2007|pmid=17131216 |doi=10.1007/s00406-006-0699-6 }}</ref>

[[Factitious disorder]]s, such as [[Munchausen syndrome]], are diagnosed where symptoms are thought to be experienced (deliberately produced) and/or reported (feigned) for personal gain.

There are attempts to introduce a category of [[relational disorder]], where the diagnosis is of a relationship rather than on any one individual in that relationship. The relationship may be between children and their parents, between couples, or others. There already exists, under the category of psychosis, a diagnosis of [[shared psychotic disorder]] where two or more individuals share a particular delusion because of their close relationship with each other.

There are a number of uncommon psychiatric [[syndromes]], which are often named after the person who first described them, such as [[Capgras syndrome]], [[De&nbsp;Clerambault syndrome]], [[Othello syndrome]], [[Ganser syndrome]], [[Cotard delusion]], and [[Delusional parasitosis|Ekbom syndrome]], and additional disorders such as the [[Couvade syndrome]] and [[Geschwind syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Trimble|first=M.|title=Uncommon psychiatric syndromes, 4th edn: Edited by M David Enoch and Hadrian N Ball (Pp 260, pound25.00).

Various new types of mental disorder diagnosis are occasionally proposed. Among those controversially considered by the official [[committees]] of the diagnostic manuals include [[self-defeating personality disorder]], [[sadistic personality disorder]], [[passive-aggressive personality disorder]] and [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]].

Two recent unique unofficial proposals are [[solastalgia]] by [[Glenn Albrecht]] and hubris syndrome by [[David Owen]]. The application of the concept of [[mental illness]] to the phenomena described by these authors has in turn been critiqued by Seamus Mac Suibhne.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mac Suibhne, S.|year=2009|title=What makes "a new mental illness"?: The cases of solastalgia and hubris syndrome|journal=Cosmos and History|volume=5|issue=2|pages=210–225|url=http://cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/143}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==

===Course===
The likely course and outcome of mental disorders varies, depends on numerous factors related to the disorder itself, the individual as a whole, and the social environment. Some disorders are transient, while others may be more chronic in nature.

Even those disorders often considered the most serious and intractable have varied courses i.e. schizophrenia, psychotic disorders, and personality disorders. Long-term international studies of schizophrenia have found that over a half of individuals recover in terms of symptoms, and around a fifth to a third in terms of symptoms and functioning, with some requiring no medication. At the same time, many have serious difficulties and support needs for many years, although "late" recovery is still possible. The World Health Organization concluded that the long-term studies' findings converged with others in "relieving patients, carers and clinicians of the chronicity paradigm which dominated thinking throughout much of the 20th century."<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Harrison G, Hopper K, Craig T, ''et al.'' |title=Recovery from psychotic illness: a 15- and 25-year international follow-up study |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=178 |pages=506–17 |date=June 2001|pmid=11388966 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11388966 |accessdate=2008-07-04 |doi=10.1192/bjp.178.6.506 |issue=6}}</ref><ref name="Jobe2005">{{Cite journal |author=Jobe TH, Harrow M |title=Long-term outcome of patients with schizophrenia: a review |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=50 |issue=14 |pages=892–900 |date=December 2005|pmid=16494258 |url=http://ww1.cpa-apc.org:8080/Publications/Archives/CJP/2005/december/cjp-dec-05-Harrow-IR.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref>

Around half of people initially diagnosed with bipolar disorder achieve syndromal recovery (no longer meeting criteria for the diagnosis) within six weeks, and nearly all achieve it within two years, with nearly half regaining their prior occupational and residential status in that period. However, nearly half go on to experience a new episode of mania or major depression within the next two years.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Tohen M, Zarate CA, Hennen J, ''et al.'' |title=The McLean-Harvard First-Episode Mania Study: prediction of recovery and first recurrence |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=12 |pages=2099–107 |date=December 2003|pmid=14638578 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/160/12/2099 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.12.2099}}</ref> Functioning has been found to vary, being poor during periods of major depression or mania but otherwise fair to good, and possibly superior during periods of hypomania in Bipolar II.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Judd LL, Akiskal HS, Schettler PJ, ''et al.'' |title=Psychosocial disability in the course of bipolar I and II disorders: a prospective, comparative, longitudinal study |journal=Arch.

===Disability===
Some disorders may be very limited in their functional effects, while others may involve substantial disability and support needs. The degree of ability or disability may vary over time and across different life domains. Furthermore, continued disability has been linked to [[institutionalization]], [[mentalism (discrimination)|discrimination]] and [[social exclusion]] as well as to the inherent effects of disorders. Alternatively, functioning may be affected by the stress of having to hide a condition in work or school etc., by adverse effects of medications or other substances, or by mismatches between illness-related variations and demands for regularity.<ref>Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation [http://www.bu.edu/cpr/reasaccom/whatis-psych.html What is Psychiatric Disability and Mental Illness?] Boston University, Retrieved January 2012</ref>

It is also the case that, while often being characterized in purely negative terms, some mental traits or states labeled as disorders can also involve above-average creativity, non-conformity, goal-striving, meticulousness, or empathy.<ref name="Rogers&Pilgram05"/> In addition, the public perception of the level of disability associated with mental disorders can change.<ref>Ferney, V. (2003) [http://www.nycvoices.org/article.php?article_id=585 The Hierarchy of Mental Illness: Which diagnosis is the least debilitating?] ''New York City Voices'' Jan/March</ref>

Nevertheless, internationally, people report equal or greater disability from commonly occurring mental conditions than from commonly occurring physical conditions, particularly in their social roles and personal relationships. The proportion with access to professional help for mental disorders is far lower, however, even among those assessed as having a severely disabling condition.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ormel|first=J.|coauthors=Petukhova, M., Chatterji, S., et al.|title=Disability and treatment of specific mental and physical disorders across the world|journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry|date=1 May 2008|volume=192|issue=5|pages=368–375|doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.107.039107|pmid=18450663|pmc=2681238}}</ref> Disability in this context may or may not involve such things as:

* Basic [[activities of daily living]]. Including looking after the self (health care, grooming, dressing, shopping, cooking etc.) or looking after accommodation (chores, DIY tasks etc.)
* [[Interpersonal relationships]]. Including [[communication skills]], ability to form relationships and sustain them, ability to leave the home or mix in crowds or particular settings
* Occupational functioning. Ability to acquire a [[employment|job]] and hold it, cognitive and social skills required for the job, dealing with [[workplace]] culture, or studying as a student.

In terms of total [[Disability-adjusted life years]] (DALYs), which is an estimate of how many years of life are lost due to premature death or to being in a state of poor health and disability, mental disorders rank amongst the most disabling conditions. Unipolar (also known as Major) depressive disorder is the third leading cause of disability worldwide, of any condition mental or physical, accounting for 65.5 million years lost. The total DALY does not necessarily indicate what is the most individually disabling, because it also depends on how common a condition is; for example, schizophrenia is found to be the most individually disabling mental disorder on average but is less common. Alcohol-use disorders are also high in the overall list, responsible for 23.7 million DALYs globally, while other drug-use disorders accounted for 8.4 million. Schizophrenia causes a total loss of 16.8 million DALY, and bipolar disorder 14.4 million. Panic disorder leads to 7 million years lost, obsessive-compulsive disorder 5.1, primary insomnia 3.6, and post-traumatic stress disorder 3.5 million DALYs.<ref>Pamela Y.

The first ever systematic description of global disability arising in youth, published in 2011, found that among 10 to 24 year olds nearly half of all disability (current and as estimated to continue) was due to mental and neurological conditions, including substance use disorders and conditions involving [[self-harm]]. Second to this were accidental injuries (mainly traffic collisions) accounting for 12 percent of disability, followed by communicable diseases at 10 percent. The disorders associated with most disability in high income countries were unipolar major depression (20%) and alcohol use disorder (11%). In the eastern Mediterranean region it was unipolar major depression (12%) and schizophrenia (7%), and in Africa it was unipolar major depression (7%) and bipolar disorder (5%).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gore|first=FM|coauthors=Bloem, PJ, Patton, GC, Ferguson, J, Joseph, V, Coffey, C, Sawyer, SM, Mathers, CD|title=Global burden of disease in young people aged 10-24 years: a systematic analysis|journal=Lancet|date=2011-06-18|volume=377|issue=9783|pages=2093–102|pmid=21652063|url=http://rch.org.au/blogs/cah/files/2011/06/Gore-et-al-Lancet-June-2011.pdf|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60512-6}}</ref>

==Causes==
{{Main|Causes of mental disorders}}
Mental disorders can arise from multiple sources, and in many cases there is no single accepted or consistent cause currently established. An [[wikt:eclectic|eclectic]] or [[Scientific pluralism|pluralistic]] mix of models may be used to explain particular disorders. The primary paradigm of contemporary mainstream Western psychiatry is said to be the [[biopsychosocial model]] which incorporates biological, psychological and social factors, although this may not always be applied in practice.

[[Biological psychiatry]] follows a [[biomedical]] model where many mental disorders are conceptualized as disorders of brain circuits likely caused by developmental processes shaped by a complex interplay of genetics and experience. A common assumption is that disorders may have resulted from [[Genetics|genetic]] and [[child development|developmental]] vulnerabilities, exposed by [[stress (biology)|stress]] in life (for example in a [[diathesis–stress model]]), although there are various views on what causes [[individual differences|differences between individuals]]. Some types of mental disorder may be viewed as primarily [[neurodevelopmental disorders]].

[[Evolutionary psychology]] may be used as an overall explanatory theory, while [[attachment theory]] is another kind of evolutionary-psychological approach sometimes applied in the context of mental disorders. [[Psychoanalytic]] theories have continued to evolve alongside cognitive-behavioral and systemic-family approaches. A distinction is sometimes made between a "[[medical model]]" or a "[[social model]]" of disorder and disability.

Studies have indicated that variation in [[genes]] can play an important role in the development of mental disorders, although the reliable identification of connections between specific genes and specific categories of disorder has proven more difficult. Environmental events surrounding [[pregnancy]] and [[birth]] have also been implicated. [[Traumatic brain injury]] may increase the risk of developing certain mental disorders. There have been some tentative inconsistent links found to certain viral infections,to substance misuse, and to general physical health.

Social influences have been found to be important, including [[abuse]], [[neglect]], [[bullying]], [[social stress]], and other negative or overwhelming life experiences. The specific risks and pathways to particular disorders are less clear, however. Aspects of the wider community have also been implicated, including [[employment]] problems, [[socioeconomic]] [[Economic inequality|inequality]], lack of social cohesion, problems linked to [[Human migration|migration]], and features of particular [[societies]] and [[cultures]].

Abnormal functioning of [[neurotransmitter]] systems has been implicated in several mental disorders, including serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine and glutamate systems. Differences have also been found in the size or activity of certain brain regions in some cases. Psychological mechanisms have also been implicated, such as [[cognitive]] (e.g. [[reasoning]]) biases, [[emotional]] influences, [[Personality psychology|personality]] dynamics, [[temperament]] and [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] style.

==Diagnosis==
Psychiatrists seek to provide a [[medical diagnosis]] of individuals by an assessment of [[symptoms]] and [[medical signs|signs]] associated with particular types of mental disorder. Other [[mental health professionals]], such as clinical psychologists, may or may not apply the same diagnostic categories to their [[clinical formulation]] of a client's difficulties and circumstances.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kinderman P, Lobban F |title=Evolving formulations: Sharing complex information with clients |journal=Behavioral and Cognitive Psychotherapy |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=307–10 |year=2000 |doi=10.1017/S1352465800003118 }}</ref> The majority of mental health problems are, at least initially, assessed and treated by family physicians (in the UK [[general practitioners]]) during consultations, who may refer a patient on for more specialist diagnosis in [[acute (medicine)|acute]] or [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] cases.

Routine diagnostic practice in mental health services typically involves an interview known as a [[mental status examination]], where evaluations are made of appearance and behavior, self-reported symptoms, mental health history, and current life circumstances. The views of other professionals, relatives or other third parties may be taken into account. A physical examination to check for ill health or the effects of medications or other drugs may be conducted. [[Psychological testing]] is sometimes used via paper-and-pen or computerized questionnaires, which may include [[algorithms]] based on ticking off standardized diagnostic criteria, and in rare specialist cases neuroimaging tests may be requested, but such methods are more commonly found in research studies than routine clinical practice.<ref>HealthWise (2004) [http://health.yahoo.com/topic/mentalhealth/symptoms/medicaltest/healthwise/tp16780 Mental Health Assessment.] Yahoo!

Time and budgetary constraints often limit practicing psychiatrists from conducting more thorough diagnostic evaluations.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Kashner TM, Rush AJ, Surís A, ''et al.'' |title=Impact of structured clinical interviews on physicians' practices in community mental health settings |journal=Psychiatr Serv |volume=54 |issue=5 |pages=712–8 |date=May 2003|pmid=12719503 |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12719503 |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.54.5.712}}</ref> It has been found that most clinicians evaluate patients using an unstructured, open-ended approach, with limited training in evidence-based assessment methods, and that inaccurate diagnosis may be common in routine practice.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Shear MK, Greeno C, Kang J, ''et al.'' |title=Diagnosis of nonpsychotic patients in community clinics |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=157 |issue=4 |pages=581–7 |date=April 2000|pmid=10739417 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10739417 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.157.4.581}}</ref> In addition, [[comorbidity]] is very common in psychiatric diagnosis, where the same person meets the criteria for more than one disorder. On the other hand, a person may have several different difficulties only some of which meet the criteria for being diagnosed. There may be specific problems with accurate diagnosis in developing countries.

Treatment and support for mental disorders is provided in [[psychiatric hospitals]], [[clinics]] or any of a diverse range of [[community mental health services]]. A number of professions have developed that specialize in the treatment of mental disorders.

In some countries services are increasingly based on a [[recovery approach]], intended to support each individual's personal journey to gain the kind of life they want, although there may also be 'therapeutic pessimism' in some areas.

There are a range of different types of treatment and what is most suitable depends on the disorder and on the individual. Many things have been found to help at least some people, and a [[placebo]] effect may play a role in any intervention or medication. In a minority of cases, individuals may be treated against their will, which can cause particular difficulties depending on how it is carried out and perceived.

===Psychotherapy===
A major option for many mental disorders is [[psychotherapy]]. There are several main types. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is widely used and is based on modifying the patterns of thought and behavior associated with a particular disorder. [[Psychoanalysis]], addressing underlying psychic conflicts and defenses, has been a dominant school of psychotherapy and is still in use. [[Systemic therapy]] or [[family therapy]] is sometimes used, addressing a network of significant others as well as an individual.

Some psychotherapies are based on a [[humanistic psychology|humanistic]] approach. There are a number of specific therapies used for particular disorders, which may be offshoots or hybrids of the above types. Mental health professionals often employ an [[Integrative Psychotherapy|eclectic or integrative approach]]. Much may depend on the [[therapeutic relationship]], and there may be problems with [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[confidentiality]] and [[engagement]].

===Medication===
A major option for many mental disorders is [[psychiatric medication]] and there are several main groups. [[Antidepressants]] are used for the treatment of [[clinical depression]], as well as often for anxiety and a range of other disorders. [[Anxiolytics]] (including [[sedatives]]) are used for anxiety disorders and related problems such as insomnia. [[Mood stabilizers]] are used primarily in bipolar disorder. [[Antipsychotics]] are used for [[psychosis|psychotic disorders]], notably for [[Schizophrenic reaction|positive symptoms in schizophrenia]], and also increasingly for a range of other disorders. [[Stimulants]] are commonly used, notably for [[ADHD]].

Despite the different conventional names of the drug groups, there may be considerable overlap in the disorders for which they are actually indicated, and there may also be [[off-label use]] of medications. There can be problems with [[adverse effects]] of medication and [[Compliance (medicine)|adherence]] to them, and there is also criticism of [[pharmaceutical marketing]] and professional [[conflicts of interest]].

===Other===
[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) is sometimes used in severe cases when other interventions for severe intractable depression have failed. [[Psychosurgery]] is considered experimental but is advocated by certain [[neurologists]] in certain rare cases.<ref>Mind Disorders Encyclopedia [http://www.minddisorders.com/Ob-Ps/Psychosurgery.html Psychosurgery] [Retrieved on August 5th 2008]</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Mashour GA, Walker EE, Martuza RL |title=Psychosurgery: past, present, and future |journal=Brain Res.

[[Counseling]] (professional) and [[co-counseling]] (between peers) may be used. [[Psychoeducation]] programs may provide people with the information to understand and manage their problems. Creative therapies are sometimes used, including [[music therapy]], [[art therapy]] or [[drama therapy]]. Lifestyle adjustments and supportive measures are often used, including [[peer support]], [[self-help groups for mental health]] and [[supported housing]] or supported employment (including [[social firms]]). Some advocate [[dietary supplements]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lakhan SE, Vieira KF |title=Nutritional therapies for mental disorders |journal=Nutr J |volume=7 |page=2 |year=2008 |pmid=18208598 |pmc=2248201 |doi=10.1186/1475-2891-7-2 |url=http://www.nutritionj.com/content/7/1/2 |issue=1}}</ref>

[[Reasonable accommodation]]s (adjustments and supports) might be put in place to help an individual cope and succeed in environments despite potential [[disability]] related to mental health problems. This could include an [[emotional support animal]] or specifically trained [[psychiatric service dog]].

==Prevention==
The 2004 WHO report "Prevention of Mental Disorders" stated that ''"Prevention of these disorders is obviously one of the most effective ways to reduce the [disease] burden."''<ref>http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/en/prevention_of_mental_disorders_sr.pdf</ref>

===Causal factors===
Risk factors for mental illness include genetic inheritance, life experiences and substance intake.<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23060622 |title=Risk of psychopathology in adolescent offspr...

===Risk assessment===
Screening questionnaires for assessing the risks of developing a mental disorder face the problem of low specificity, which means that the majority of the people with an increased risk will not develop the disorder. However combining risk factors gives higher estimated risk. For instance risk of depression is higher for a widow who also has an illness and lives alone.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16946188 |title=Prevention of late-life depression in primar...

The 2009 US National Academies publication on preventing mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders among young people focused on recent research and program experience and stated that ''"A number of promotion and prevention programs are now available that should be considered for broad implementation."''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12480 |title=The National Academies Press: Preventing Mental, Emotional, and Behavioral Disorders Among Young People: Progress and Possibilities |publisher=Nap.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1472261/ |title=World Psychiatry: Prevention of mental and behavioural disorders: implications for policy and practice |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=2013-03-25 |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref> A 2011 review of this by the authors said ''"A scientific base of evidence shows that we can prevent many mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders before they begin"'' and made recommendations including
* supporting the mental health and parenting skills of parents,
* encouraging the developmental competencies of children and
* using preventive strategies particularly for children at risk (such as children of parents with mental illness, or with family stresses such as divorce or job loss).<ref>William Beardslee, Peter Chien, Carl Bell http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/data/Journals/PSS/3936/pss6203_0247.pdf</ref>

The 2012 UK Schizophrenia Commission recommended ''"a preventative strategy for psychosis including promoting protective factors for mental wellbeing and reducing risks such as cannabis use in early adolescence."''<ref name="schizophreniacommission.org.uk"/>

It is already known that home visiting programs for pregnant women and parents of young children can produce replicable effects on children's general health and development in a variety of community settings.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01702.x}}</ref> Similarly positive benefits from social and emotional education are well proven.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01564.x}}</ref>

===Within mental health strategies===
Prevention is currently a very small part of the spend of mental health systems. For instance the 2009 UK Department of Health analysis of prevention expenditure does not include any apparent spend on mental health.<ref>http://www.healthengland.org/publications/HealthEnglandReportNo4.pdf</ref> The situation is the same in research.<ref name="schizophreniacommission.org.uk"/>

However prevention is beginning to appear in mental health strategies:
* In 2012 Mind, the UK mental health NGO, included ''"Staying well; Support people likely to develop mental health problems, to stay well."'' as its first goal for 2012-16.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mind.org.uk/about/what_we_do/our_plans |title=Our plans |publisher=Mind |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref>

* The 2011 US National Prevention Strategy included mental and emotional well-being, with recommendations including (i) better parenting and (ii) early intervention.<ref>http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf</ref>
* Australia's mental health plan for 2009-14 included "Prevention and Early Intervention" as priority 2.<ref>http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/360EB322114EC906CA2576700014A817/$File/pla2.pdf</ref>
* The 2008 EU "Pact for Mental Health" made recommendations for youth and education including (i) promotion of parenting skills, (ii) integration of socio-emotional learning into education curricular and extracurricular activities, and (iii) early intervention throughout the educational system.<ref>http://ec.europa.eu/health/mental_health/docs/mhpact_en.pdf</ref>

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
{{Main|History of mental disorders}}
[[File:R212F1.jpeg|thumb|250px|Early color illustration of psychiatric treatment methods]]

===Ancient civilizations===
Ancient civilizations described and treated a number of mental disorders. The Greeks coined terms for [[melancholy]], [[hysteria]] and phobia and developed the [[humorism]] theory. Mental disorders were described, and treatments developed, in Persia, Arabia and in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]].

===Europe===

====Middle Ages====
Conceptions of madness in the Middle Ages in Christian Europe were a mixture of the divine, diabolical, magical and humoral, as well as more down to earth considerations. In the early modern period, some people with mental disorders may have been victims of the witch-hunts but were increasingly admitted to local workhouses and jails or sometimes to private madhouses. Many terms for mental disorder that found their way into everyday use first became popular in the 16th and 17th centuries.

====Eighteenth century====
By the end of the 17th century and into the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], madness was increasingly seen as an organic physical phenomenon with no connection to the soul or moral responsibility. Asylum care was often harsh and treated people like wild animals, but towards the end of the 18th century a [[moral treatment]] movement gradually developed. Clear descriptions of some syndromes may be rare prior to the 19th century.

====Nineteenth century====
[[Industrialization]] and population growth led to a massive expansion of the number and size of insane asylums in every Western country in the 19th century. Numerous different classification schemes and diagnostic terms were developed by different authorities, and the term [[psychiatry]] was coined, though medical superintendents were still known as alienists.

====Twentieth century====
The turn of the 20th century saw the development of psychoanalysis, which would later come to the fore, along with [[Kraepelin]]'s classification scheme. Asylum "inmates" were increasingly referred to as "patients", and asylums renamed as hospitals.

===Europe and the U.S.===
Early in the 20th century in the United States, a [[mental hygiene]] movement developed, aiming to prevent mental disorders. [[Clinical psychology]] and [[social work]] developed as professions. [[World War I]] saw a massive increase of conditions that came to be termed "[[Combat stress reaction|shell shock]]".

[[World War II]] saw the development in the U.S. of a new psychiatric manual for categorizing mental disorders, which along with existing systems for collecting census and hospital statistics led to the first [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) also developed a section on mental disorders. The term [[stress (biological)|stress]], having emerged out of [[endocrinology]] work in the 1930s, was increasingly applied to mental disorders.
[[File:Insulin shock therapy.jpg|thumb|250px|Insulin Shock Therapy]]

[[Electroconvulsive therapy]], [[insulin shock therapy]], [[lobotomy|lobotomies]] and the "[[neuroleptic]]" [[chlorpromazine]] came to be used by mid-century. An [[antipsychiatry]] movement came to the fore in the 1960s. [[Deinstitutionalization]] gradually occurred in the West, with isolated psychiatric hospitals being closed down in favor of [[community mental health services]]. A [[Psychiatric survivors movement|consumer/survivor movement]] gained momentum. Other kinds of psychiatric medication gradually came into use, such as "psychic energizers" (later [[antidepressants]]) and [[lithium pharmacology|lithium]]. [[Benzodiazepines]] gained widespread use in the 1970s for anxiety and depression, until dependency problems curtailed their popularity.

Advances in [[neuroscience]], genetics and psychology led to new research agendas. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] and other psychotherapies developed. The DSM and then ICD adopted new criteria-based classifications, and the number of "official" diagnoses saw a large expansion. Through the 1990s, new [[SSRI]]-type antidepressants became some of the most widely prescribed drugs in the world, as later did [[antipsychotics]]. Also during the 1990s, a [[recovery approach]] developed.

==Society and culture==
[[Image:Self.svg|right|200px]]
Different societies or [[cultures]], even different individuals in a [[subculture]], can disagree as to what constitutes optimal versus pathological biological and psychological functioning. Research has demonstrated that cultures vary in the relative importance placed on, for example, happiness, autonomy, or social relationships for pleasure. Likewise, the fact that a behavior pattern is valued, accepted, encouraged, or even statistically normative in a culture does not necessarily mean that it is conducive to optimal psychological functioning.

People in all cultures find some behaviors bizarre or even incomprehensible. But just what they feel is bizarre or incomprehensible is ambiguous and subjective.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Heinimaa M |title=Incomprehensibility: the role of the concept in DSM-IV definition of schizophrenic delusions |journal=Med Health Care Philos |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=291–5 |date=October 2002|pmid=12517037 |doi=10.1023/A:1021164602485 |url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=1386-7423&volume=5&page=291}}</ref> These differences in determination can become highly contentious. [[Religious]], [[spirituality|spiritual]], or [[transpersonal]] experiences and beliefs are typically not defined as disordered, especially if widely shared, despite meeting many criteria of delusional or psychotic disorders.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Pierre JM |title=Faith or delusion?

The process by which conditions and difficulties come to be defined and treated as medical conditions and problems, and thus come under the authority of doctors and other health professionals, is known as [[medicalization]] or pathologization.

===Movements===
The [[consumer/survivor movement]] (also known as user/survivor movement) is made up of individuals (and organizations representing them) who are clients of mental health services or who consider themselves survivors of psychiatric interventions. Activists campaign for improved mental health services and for more involvement and empowerment within mental health services, policies and wider society.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Everett B |title=Something is happening: the contemporary consumer and psychiatric survivor movement in historical context |journal=Journal of Mind and Behavior |volume=15 |issue=1–2 |pages=55–7 |year=1994 |url=http://www.brown.uk.com/brownlibrary/EVERETT.htm }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Rissmiller DJ, Rissmiller JH |title=Evolution of the antipsychiatry movement into mental health consumerism |journal=Psychiatr Serv |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=863–6 |date=June 2006|pmid=16754765 |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.57.6.863 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Oaks D |title=The evolution of the consumer movement |journal=Psychiatr Serv |volume=57 |issue=8 |pages=1212; author reply 1216 |date=August 2006|pmid=16870979 |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.57.8.1212 |url=http://psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/57/8/1212}}</ref> [[Patient advocacy]] organizations have expanded with increasing [[deinstitutionalization]] in developed countries, working to challenge the [[stereotypes]], stigma and exclusion associated with psychiatric conditions. There is also a [[carers rights movement]] of people who help and support people with mental health conditions, who may be relatives, and who often work in difficult and time-consuming circumstances with little acknowledgement and without pay. An [[antipsychiatry]] movement fundamentally challenges mainstream psychiatric theory and practice, including in some cases asserting that psychiatric concepts and diagnoses of 'mental illness' are neither real nor useful.<ref name=AntiPsychCoal>The Antipsychiatry Coalition.

===Cultural bias===
Current diagnostic guidelines, namely the DSM and to some extent the ICD, have been criticized as having a fundamentally Euro-American outlook. Opponents argue that even when diagnostic criteria are used across different cultures, it does not mean that the underlying constructs have validity within those cultures, as even reliable application can prove only consistency, not legitimacy.<ref name=Widiger2000>{{cite journal |author=Widiger TA, Sankis LM |title=Adult psychopathology: issues and controversies |journal=Annu Rev Psychol |volume=51 |pages=377–404 |year=2000 |pmid=10751976 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.51.1.377 }}</ref> Advocating a more culturally sensitive approach, critics such as [[Carl Bell (physician)|Carl Bell]] and Marcello Maviglia contend that the cultural and [[ethnic]] diversity of individuals is often discounted by researchers and service providers.<ref name=wash-post>Shankar Vedantam, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/25/AR2005062500982.html Psychiatry's Missing Diagnosis: Patients' Diversity Is Often Discounted] Washington Post: Mind and Culture, June 26</ref>

[[Cross-cultural psychiatry|Cross-cultural psychiatrist]] [[Arthur Kleinman]] contends that the Western bias is ironically illustrated in the introduction of cultural factors to the [[DSM-IV]]. Disorders or concepts from non-Western or non-mainstream cultures are described as "culture-bound", whereas standard psychiatric diagnoses are given no cultural qualification whatsoever, revealing to Kleinman an underlying assumption that Western cultural phenomena are universal.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kleinman A |title=Triumph or pyrrhic victory? The inclusion of culture in DSM-IV |journal=Harv Rev Psychiatry |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=343–4 |year=1997 |pmid=9385013 |doi=10.3109/10673229709030563 }}</ref> Kleinman's negative view towards the [[culture-bound syndrome]] is largely shared by other cross-cultural critics. Common responses included both disappointment over the large number of documented non-Western mental disorders still left out and frustration that even those included are often misinterpreted or misrepresented.<ref>Bhugra, D. & Munro, A. (1997) ''Troublesome Disguises: Underdiagnosed Psychiatric Syndromes'' Blackwell Science Ltd</ref>

Many mainstream psychiatrists are dissatisfied with the new culture-bound diagnoses, although for partly different reasons. [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]], a lead architect of the [[DSM-III]], has argued that adding cultural formulations was an attempt to appease cultural critics, and has stated that they lack any scientific rationale or support. Spitzer also posits that the new culture-bound diagnoses are rarely used, maintaining that the standard diagnoses apply regardless of the culture involved. In general, mainstream psychiatric opinion remains that if a diagnostic category is valid, cross-cultural factors are either irrelevant or are significant only to specific symptom presentations.<ref name="Widiger2000" />

Clinical conceptions of mental illness also overlap with [[value (personal and cultural)|personal and cultural values]] in the domain of [[morality]], so much so that it is sometimes argued that separating the two is impossible without fundamentally redefining the essence of being a particular [[person]] in a society.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clark LA |title=The role of moral judgment in personality disorder diagnosis |journal=J Pers Disord. |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=184–5 |year=2006 |doi=10.1521/pedi.2006.20.2.184 }}</ref> In clinical psychiatry, persistent distress and disability indicate an internal disorder requiring treatment; but in another context, that same distress and disability can be seen as an indicator of emotional struggle and the need to address social and structural problems.<ref name="Karasz05">{{Cite journal |author=Karasz A |title=Cultural differences in conceptual models of depression |journal=Social Science in Medicine |volume=60 |issue=7 |pages=1625–35 |date=April 2005|pmid=15652693 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.08.011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.5555/hesr.2004.13.1.54 | last1 = Tilbury | first1 = F. | last2 = Rapley | first2 = M. | year = 2004 | title = 'There are orphans in Africa still looking for my hands': African women refugees and the sources of emotional distress | url = http://www.atypon-link.com/EMP/doi/abs/10.5555/hesr.2004.13.1.54 | journal = Health Sociology Review | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 54–64 }}</ref> This dichotomy has led some academics and clinicians to advocate a [[postmodernist]] conceptualization of mental distress and well-being.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Bracken P, Thomas P |title=Postpsychiatry: a new direction for mental health |journal=BMJ |volume=322 |issue=7288 |pages=724–7 |date=March 2001|pmid=11264215 |pmc=1119907 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11264215 |doi=10.1136/bmj.322.7288.724}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lewis B |title=Psychiatry and Postmodern Theory |journal=J Med Humanit |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=71–84 |year=2000 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/link.asp?id=j75517g14h618189 |doi=10.1023/A:1009018429802}}</ref>

Such approaches, along with cross-cultural and "[[heresy|heretical]]" psychologies centered on alternative cultural and [[ethnic]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race-based]] identities and experiences, stand in contrast to the mainstream psychiatric community's alleged avoidance of any explicit involvement with either morality or culture.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kwate NO |title=The heresy of African-centered psychology |journal=J Med Humanit |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=215–35 |year=2005 |pmid=16333686 |doi=10.1007/s10912-005-7698-x }}</ref> In many countries there are attempts to challenge perceived prejudice against [[minority groups]], including alleged [[institutional racism]] within psychiatric services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pb.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/31/10/367.pdf |title=Commentary on institutional racism in psychiatry, 2007 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref> There are also ongoing attempts to improve professional [[cross cultural sensitivity]].

===Laws and policies===
Three quarters of countries around the world have mental health legislation. Compulsory admission to mental health facilities (also known as [[involuntary commitment]]) is a controversial topic. It can impinge on personal liberty and the right to choose, and carry the risk of abuse for political, social and other reasons; yet it can potentially prevent harm to self and others, and assist some people in attaining their right to healthcare when they may be unable to decide in their own interests.<ref name="WHORIGHTS">World Health Organization (2005) [http://www.who.int/mental_health/policy/who_rb_mnh_hr_leg_FINAL_11_07_05.pdf WHO Resource Book on Mental Health: Human rights and legislation] ISBN 924156282 (PDF)</ref>

All [[human rights]] oriented mental health laws require proof of the presence of a mental disorder as defined by internationally accepted standards, but the type and severity of disorder that counts can vary in different jurisdictions. The two most often utilized grounds for involuntary admission are said to be serious likelihood of immediate or imminent danger to self or others, and the need for treatment. Applications for someone to be involuntarily admitted usually come from a mental health practitioner, a family member, a close relative, or a guardian. Human-rights-oriented laws usually stipulate that independent medical practitioners or other accredited mental health practitioners must examine the patient separately and that there should be regular, time-bound review by an independent review body.<ref name="WHORIGHTS"/> The individual should also have personal access to independent [[advocacy]].

In order for [[involuntary treatment]] to be administered (by force if necessary), it should be shown that an individual lacks the mental capacity for [[informed consent]] (i.e. to understand treatment information and its implications, and therefore be able to make an informed choice to either accept or refuse). Legal challenges in some areas have resulted in [[supreme court]] decisions that a person does ''not'' have to agree with a psychiatrist's characterization of the issues as constituting an "illness", nor agree with a psychiatrist's conviction in medication, but only recognize the issues and the information about treatment options.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Sklar R |title=Starson v. Swayze: the Supreme Court speaks out (not all that clearly) on the question of "capacity" |journal=Can J Psychiatry |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=390–6 |date=June 2007|pmid=17696026 }}</ref>

Proxy consent (also known as [[Surrogate decision-maker|surrogate or substituted decision-making]]) may be transferred to a personal representative, a family member or a legally appointed guardian. Moreover, patients may be able to make, when they are considered well, an [[advance directive]] stipulating how they wish to be treated should they be deemed to lack mental capacity in future.<ref name="WHORIGHTS"/> The right to [[Decision aids|supported decision-making]], where a person is helped to understand and choose treatment options before they can be declared to lack capacity, may also be included in legislation.<ref>Manitoba Family Services and Housing. The Vulnerable Persons Living with a Mental Disability Act, 1996</ref> There should at the very least be [[shared decision-making]] as far as possible. Involuntary treatment laws are increasingly extended to those living in the community, for example [[outpatient commitment]] laws (known by different names) are used in [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]] and most of the [[United States]].

The World Health Organization reports that in many instances national mental health legislation takes away the rights of persons with mental disorders rather than protecting rights, and is often outdated.<ref name="WHORIGHTS"/> In 1991, the [[United Nations]] adopted the ''Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and the Improvement of Mental Health Care'', which established minimum human rights standards of practice in the mental health field. In 2006, the UN formally agreed the ''[[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]'' to protect and enhance the rights and opportunities of disabled people, including those with psychosocial disabilities.<ref>[http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/ ENABLE website] UN section on disability</ref>

The term [[insanity]], sometimes used [[colloquialism|colloquially]] as a [[synonym]] for mental illness, is often used technically as a legal term. The [[insanity defense]] may be used in a legal trial (known as the [[mental disorder defence]] in some countries).

A 2008 study by [[Baylor University]] researchers found that clergy in the US often deny or dismiss the existence of a mental illness. Of 293 [[Christian]] church members, more than 32 percent were told by their church [[pastor]] that they or their loved one did not really have a mental illness, and that the cause of their problem was solely [[spirituality|spiritual]] in nature, such as a personal sin, lack of faith or [[demon]]ic involvement. The researchers also found that women were more likely than men to get this response. All participants in both studies were previously diagnosed by a licensed mental health provider as having a serious mental illness.<ref>[http://newswise.com/articles/view/545316/ Study Finds Serious Mental Illness Often Dismissed by Local Church] Newswise, Retrieved on October 15, 2008.</ref> However, there is also research suggesting that people are often helped by [[extended families]] and supportive religious leaders who listen with kindness and respect, which can often contrast with usual practice in psychiatric diagnosis and medication.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article6538213.ece Psychiatric diagnoses are less reliable than star signs] Times Online, June 2009</ref>

;Violence
Despite public or media opinion, national studies have indicated that severe mental illness does not independently predict future violent behavior, on average, and is not a leading cause of violence in society. There is a statistical association with various factors that do relate to violence (in anyone), such as substance abuse and various personal, social and economic factors.<ref name="pmid19188537">{{Cite journal |author=Elbogen EB, Johnson SC |title=The intricate link between violence and mental disorder: results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions |journal=Arch.

However, there are some specific diagnoses, such as childhood conduct disorder or adult [[antisocial personality disorder]] or [[psychopathy]], which are defined by, or are inherently associated with, conduct problems and violence.

==In animals==
[[Psychopathology]] in non-human [[primates]] has been studied since the mid-20th century. Over 20 behavioral patterns in captive chimpanzees have been documented as (statistically) abnormal for frequency, severity or oddness—some of which have also been observed in the wild. Captive [[great apes]] show gross behavioral abnormalities such as [[stereotypy]] of movements, [[self-mutilation]], disturbed emotional reactions (mainly fear or aggression) towards companions, lack of species-typical communications, and generalized [[learned helplessness]]. In some cases such behaviors are hypothesized to be equivalent to symptoms associated with psychiatric disorders in humans such as depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. Concepts of antisocial, borderline and schizoid personality disorders have also been applied to non-human great apes.<ref name="Brune2006">{{cite journal |author=Brüne M, Brüne-Cohrs U, McGrew WC, Preuschoft S |title=Psychopathology in great apes: concepts, treatment options and possible homologies to human psychiatric disorders |journal=Neurosci Biobehav Rev |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=1246–59 |year=2006 |pmid=17141312 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2006.09.002 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Ferdowsian|first=HR|coauthors=Durham, DL, Kimwele, C, Kranendonk, G, Otali, E, Akugizibwe, T, Mulcahy, JB, Ajarova, L, Johnson, CM|title=Signs of mood and anxiety disorders in chimpanzees|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2011|volume=6|issue=6|pages=e19855|pmid=21698223|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0019855|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0019855|pmc=3116818|editor1-last=Callaerts|editor1-first=Patrick}}</ref>

The risk of [[anthropomorphism]] is often raised with regard to such comparisons, and assessment of non-human animals cannot incorporate evidence from linguistic communication. However, available evidence may range from nonverbal behaviors—including physiological responses and homologous facial displays and acoustic utterances—to neurochemical studies. It is pointed out that human psychiatric classification is often based on statistical description and judgment of behaviors (especially when speech or language is impaired) and that the use of verbal self-report is itself problematic and unreliable.<ref name="Brune2006"/><ref name="Fabrega2006">{{cite journal |author=Fabrega H |title=Making sense of behavioral irregularities of great apes |journal=Neurosci Biobehav Rev |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=1260–73; discussion 1274–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17079015 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2006.09.004 }}</ref>

Psychopathology has generally been traced, at least in captivity, to adverse rearing conditions such as early separation of infants from mothers; early sensory deprivation; and extended periods of social isolation. Studies have also indicated individual variation in temperament, such as sociability or impulsiveness. Particular causes of problems in captivity have included integration of strangers into existing groups and a lack of individual space, in which context some pathological behaviors have also been seen as coping mechanisms. Remedial interventions have included careful individually tailored re-socialization programs, [[behavior therapy]], environment enrichment, and on rare occasions psychiatric drugs.
