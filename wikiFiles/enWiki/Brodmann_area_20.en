==Human==
'''Brodmann area 20''', or BA20, is part of the [[temporal lobe|temporal]] [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] in the [[human brain]]. The region encompasses most of the ventral temporal cortex, a region believed to play a part in high-level visual processing and recognition memory.

This area is also known as '''inferior temporal area 20''', and it refers to a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined temporal region of cerebral cortex. In the human it corresponds approximately to the inferior temporal gyrus. Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded medially by the [[ectorhinal area 36]] (H), laterally by the [[middle temporal area 21]], rostrally by the [[temporopolar area 38]] (H) and caudally by the [[occipitotemporal area 37]] (H) (Brodmann-1909).

==Guenon==
'''Brodmann area 20''' is a subdivision of the cerebral cortex of the [[guenon]] defined on the basis of [[cytoarchitecture]]. It is cytoarchitecturally [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to the inferior temporal area 20 of the human (Brodmann-1909). Distinctive features (Brodmann-1905): area 20 is similar to [[area 19 of Brodmann]]-1909 in the relative abundance of small cell types relative to the number of larger [[pyramidal cell]]s; a very dense, wide internal [[granular layer]] (IV) composed almost exclusively of [[granule cell]]s, as in [[area 18 of Brodmann]]-1909; a broad, clear internal [[pyramidal layer]] (V) with few cells; and a distinct [[multiform layer]] (VI). The major differences from areas 18 and 19 are somewhat lesser cell density; absence of a division of the external pyramidal layer (III) into sublayers 3a and 3b; layer V is more clearly distinguished from layer VI and, on average, has a greater density of pyramidal [[ganglion cell]]s than in the other areas; layer VI is wider, more diffuse and has fewer cells that are concentrated in the outer part of the layer to produce a denser sublayer 6a and a less dense sublayer 6b.
