'''Proctalgia fugax''' (or '''levator syndrome''', also known as '''anal cold''') is a severe, episodic, [[rectal]] and [[sacrococcygeal]] pain.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|eight/000104394|levator syndrome}}</ref> It can be caused by cramp of the [[Pubococcygeus muscle|pubococcygeus]] or [[levator ani]] muscles.<ref name="isbn0-8247-9409-5">{{cite book |author=Olden, Kevin W. |title=Handbook of functional gastrointestinal disorders |publisher=M.

In a study published in 2007 involving 1809 patients, the attacks occurred in the daytime, (33 percent) as well as at night (33 percent) and the average number of attacks was 13. Onset can be in childhood, however, in multiple studies the average age of onset was 45. Many studies showed that women are affected more commonly than men.<ref name="pmid17164968">{{cite journal |author=de Parades V, Etienney I, Bauer P, Taouk M, Atienza P |title=Proctalgia fugax: demographic and clinical characteristics.

During an episode,  the patient feels spasm-like, sometimes excruciating, pain in the anus, often misinterpreted as a need to defecate. Simultaneous stimulation of the local autonomic system can cause erection in males. Because of the high incident of internal anal sphincter thickening with the disorder, it is thought to be a disorder of the internal anal sphincter or that it is a neuralgia of pudendal nerves. It is recurrent and there is also no known cure. However, some studies show effective use of [[botulinum toxin]], pudendal nerve block, and [[calcium channel blocker]]s. It is not known to be linked to any disease process and data on the number of people afflicted varies, but is more prevalent than usually thought.

The pain episode subsides by itself as the spasm disappears on its own, but may reoccur.<ref name="pmid10457046" />

Sometimes there is a drop in blood pressure that may cause loss of consciousness and possible injury.  Staying down is suggested if in bed, and lying down is recommended.

==Treatment and prevention==
Traditional remedies have ranged from warm [[Bathing|baths]] (if the pain lasts long enough to draw a bath), warm to hot [[enemas]],<ref name="pmid17949444">{{cite journal |author=Olsen B |title=Proctalgia fugax - a nightmare drowned in enema |journal=Colorectal Disease|volume= 10|issue= 5|pages= 522–3|year=2007 |pmid=17949444 |doi=10.1111/j.1463-1318.2007.01399.x}}</ref> relaxation techniques, and various medications. 

In patients who suffer frequent, severe, prolonged attacks, inhaled [[salbutamol]] has been shown in some studies to reduce their duration.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eckardt VF, Dodt O, Kanzler G, Bernhard G |title=Treatment of proctalgia fugax with salbutamol inhalation |journal=Am. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=91 |issue=4 |pages=686–9 |year=1996 |pmid=8677929 }}</ref> 

The use of [[botulinum toxin]] has been proposed as analgesic,<ref name="pmid17168867">{{cite journal |author=Wollina U, Konrad H, Petersen S |title=Botulinum toxin in dermatology - beyond wrinkles and sweat |journal=Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=223–7 |year=2005 |pmid=17168867 |doi=10.1111/j.1473-2165.2005.00195.x}}</ref> and low dose [[diazepam]] at bedtime has been suggested as preventative.<ref name="pmid11430454">{{cite journal |author=Pfenninger JL, Zainea GG |title=Common anorectal conditions: Part I.

Some patients find that sitting on a ball, such as a baseball, covered with a heating pad makes the pain more bearable and helps pain subside quicker.
The drug Anaspaz, an anti-spasmotic, is also prescribed for the pain.

Glycerol trinitrate, as spray or ointment is very effective for some.

The most common approach is simply reassurance and topical treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Int J Colorectal Dis|date=2010 Sep|volume=25|issue=9|pages=1037–46|title=Proctalgia fugax, an evidence-based management pathway|author=Jeyarajah S, Chow A, Ziprin P, Tilney H, Purkayastha S |pmid=20556402 |doi=10.1007/s00384-010-0984-8 }}</ref>
