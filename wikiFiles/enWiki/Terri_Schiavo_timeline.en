==1994==

*March 1: Guardian ad litem John H. Pecarek submits his report which states that Michael Schiavo acted appropriately and attentively toward Terri Schiavo.

*In March, Terri is moved to Palm Gardens of Largo, a skilled nursing facility in [[Seminole, Florida]].

*The administration of one nursing home attempts, unsuccessfully, to get a restraining order against Michael because he was demanding more attention for his wife at the expense of other patients' care.

==1995==

*Michael begins his relationship with Jodi Centonze.

==1998==

*May: Michael Schiavo files a petition to discontinue feeding tube for Terri Schiavo. Terri's parents fight the petition.

*June: Richard Pearse, Esq. is appointed guardian ad litem for Terri Schiavo by the [[Circuit Court]] for [[Pinellas County, Florida]].

*September 11: Dr. Jeffrey Karp neurologically evaluates Terri and indicates that she "is in a chronic vegetative state" exhibiting "an absence of voluntary activity or cognitive behavior...inability to communicate or interact purposefully with her environment."  Karp also notes that "her chance of any improvement to a functional level is essentially zero."

*Dr. Gambone, Terri's primary care physician, informs guardian ad litem Richard Pearse that Dr. Karp's PVS diagnosis (and prognosis) is the medical consensus.

*November: Terri's parents become aware of the bone scan report that was performed in 1991. Terri's parents and Dr. [[William Hammesfahr]] claim the trauma shown in the bone scan was a result of Terri being abused by Michael. Provided with only the scan information, forensic pathologist, Dr. Michael Baden suggests a head injury caused the trauma. After learning Terri's full history, Dr. Baden agrees that the trauma is consistent with her cardiac arrest, fall, [[CPR]] attempts, and eventual [[resuscitation]]. The parents petition the Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court for a full evidentiary hearing to evaluate the new evidence. Judge [[George Greer]] denies the motion.

*December 29: The second [[guardian ad litem]], Richard Pearse, submits his report to the Pinellas-Pasco County Circuit Court.  Pearse concludes that Terri Schiavo is in a persistent vegetative state with no possibility of improvement and that Michael Schiavo's decisions may be influenced by the potential to inherit what remains of Terri Schiavo's estate.  Due to a perceived lack of evidence for Terri's wishes, and questions regarding Michael Schiavo's credibility, Pearse recommends denying Michael Schiavo's petition to remove Terri's feeding tube.

*April 26: Terri's feeding tube is removed for the first time. It is reinserted two days later on an appeal by her parents.

:Five doctors are selected to provide their expert opinions to the trial. Schiavo's parents select Dr. William Maxfield, a retired radiologist, and Dr. [[William Hammesfahr]], a neurologist.

These five doctors examine Terri Schiavo's medical records, brain scans, the videos, and Schiavo herself.

== 2003 ==

Pulley says, "The chance that this person is going to recover is about zero."<ref>[http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/nation/11213061.htm kansascity.com]</ref>
