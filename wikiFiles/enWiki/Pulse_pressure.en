'''Pulse pressure''' is the pressure that is felt when feeling the pulse.  Measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), the pressure difference between the systolic and diastolic pressures is the pressure change to create the pulse, which is the pulse pressure.   If resting blood pressure is (systolic/diastolic) 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mmHg), pulse pressure is 40.<ref>A review of educational strategies to improve nurses' roles in recognizing and responding to deteriorating patients. Liaw SY, Scherpbier A, Klainin-Yobas P, Rethans JJ.</ref>

==Calculation==
Formally it is the '''systolic pressure minus the diastolic pressure.'''<ref>http://highbloodpressure.about.com/od/highbloodpressure101/p/pulse_pressure.htm</ref>

Theoretically, the systemic pulse pressure can be conceptualized as being proportional to [[stroke volume]], or the amount of blood ejected from the left ventricle during systole and inversely proportional to the compliance of the aorta.<ref>[http://www.cvphysiology.com/Blood%20Pressure/BP003.htm Arterial pulse pressure<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  

The [[aorta]] has the highest compliance in the arterial system due in part to a relatively greater proportion of elastin fibers versus smooth muscle and collagen. This serves the important function of dampening the pulsatile output of the left ventricle, thereby reducing the pulse pressure. If the aorta becomes rigid in conditions such as [[arteriosclerosis]] or [[atherosclerosis]], the pulse pressure would be very high.

* Systemic pulse pressure = P<sub>systolic</sub> - P<sub>diastolic</sub> = 120mmHg - 80mmHg = 40mmHg
* Pulmonary pulse pressure = P<sub>systolic</sub> - P<sub>diastolic</sub> = 25mmHg - 10mmHg = 15mmHg

==Values and variation==
===Low (Narrow) Pulse Pressure===
A pulse pressure is considered abnormally low if it is less than 25% of the systolic value. The most common cause of a low (narrow) pulse pressure is a drop in left ventricular stroke volume.
In trauma a low or narrow pulse pressure suggests significant blood loss (insufficient preload leading to reduced cardiac output).<ref>{{cite book |author=American College of Surgeons |title=Atls, Advanced Trauma Life Support Program for Doctors |publisher=Amer College of Surgeons |location= |year=2008 |pages=58 |isbn=1-880696-31-6 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (6) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

If the pulse pressure is extremely low, i.e. 25 mmHg or less, the cause may be low stroke volume, as in [[Congestive Heart Failure]] and/or [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].

A narrow pulse pressure is also caused by [[aortic valve stenosis]] and [[cardiac tamponade]].

===High (Wide) Pulse Pressure===
====High values during or shortly after exercise====
Usually, the resting [[pulse]] pressure in healthy adults, sitting position, is about 30-40 [[mmHg]]. The pulse pressure increases with exercise due to increased stroke volume,<ref>[http://www.pps.org.pk/PJP/3-2/07-Farida.pdf DETERMINATION OF CARDIAC OUTPUT IN MEDICAL STUDENTS BY PULSE PRESSURE METHOD], Farida Munawar, Fareeha, Maryam, Sana, Anushe, Nida - Department of Physiology, Fatima Jinnah Medical College, Lahore, Pak J Physiol 2007;3(2)</ref> healthy values being up to pulse pressures of about 100 mmHg, simultaneously as [[total peripheral resistance]] drops during exercise. In healthy individuals the pulse pressure will typically return to normal within about 10 minutes. For most individuals, during aerobic exercise, the [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] pressure progressively increases while the [[diastolic]] remains about the same. In some very aerobically athletic individuals, for example distance runners, the [[diastolic]] will progressively fall as the [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] increases. This behavior facilitates a much greater increase in [[stroke volume]] and [[cardiac output]] at a lower [[mean arterial pressure]] and enables much greater aerobic capacity and physical performance. The diastolic drop reflects a much greater fall in total peripheral resistance of the muscle [[arteriole]]s in response to the exercise (a greater proportion of red versus white muscle tissue). Individuals with larger BMIs due to increased muscle mass (body builders) have also been shown to have lower diastolic pressures and larger pulse pressures.<ref>[http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/33/6/1385?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=arterial&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=60&resourcetype=HWFIG Muscular Strength Training Is Associated With Low Arterial Compliance and High Pulse Pressure] -- Bertovic et al. 33 (6): 1385 -- Hypertension</ref>

====Consistently high values====
If the usual resting pulse pressure is consistently greater than 100 mmHg, the most likely basis is [[Arterial stiffness|stiffness of the major arteries]], [[aortic regurgitation]] (a leak in the [[aortic valve]]), [[arteriovenous malformation]] (an extra path for blood to travel from a high pressure artery to a low pressure vein without the gradient of a capillary bed), [[hyperthyroidism]] or some combination. (A chronically increased stroke volume is also a technical possibility, but very rare in practice.)  While some drugs for hypertension have the side effect of increasing resting pulse pressure irreversibly, other hypertension drugs, such as [[Ace inhibitor|ACE Inhibitors]], have been shown to lower pulse pressure. A high resting pulse pressure is harmful and tends to accelerate the normal aging of body organs, particularly the heart, the brain and kidneys.  A high pulse pressure combined with [[bradycardia]] and an irregular breathing pattern is associated with increased [[intracranial pressure]] and should be reported to a physician immediately. This is known as [[Cushing's triad]] and can be seen in patients after head trauma related to intracranial hemorrhage or edema.

==Relationship to heart disease==
Recent work suggests that a high pulse pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease. A meta-analysis in 2000, which combined the results of several studies of 8,000 elderly patients in all, found that a 10&nbsp;mm Hg increase in pulse pressure increased the risk of major cardiovascular complications and mortality by nearly 20%.<ref>Blacher J, Staessen JA, Girerd X, Gasowski J, Thijs L, Liu L, Wang JG, Fagard RH, Safar ME. Pulse pressure not mean pressure determines cardiovascular risk in older hypertensive patients. ''Arch Intern Med'' 2000 Apr 24;160(8):1085-9. PMID 10789600</ref> Heightened pulse pressure is also a risk factor for the development of [[atrial fibrillation]].<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/552468 Pulse Pressure Important Risk Factor for the Development of New-Onset AF  CME] {{Dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref> The authors of the meta-analysis suggest that this helps to explain the apparent increase in risk sometimes associated with low diastolic pressure, and warn that some medications for high blood pressure may actually increase the pulse pressure and the risk of heart disease.

==Self measurement==
Pulse pressure readings can be taken on a home blood pressure monitoring device. These devices display systolic and diastolic blood pressure, from which pulse pressure can be calculated, and pulse rate readings. Monitoring at home will measure true pulse and blood pressure and is helpful to a medical provider in interpreting in-office results and/or progression of disease processes.

==Treatment==
If the patient suffers from elevated pulse pressure, treatment may include medications that address this factor, such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ([[ACE inhibitor]]).<ref>Pulse Pressure Builds Steam as Mortality Predictor - Brief Article - Statistical Data Included http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BJI/is_1_30/ai_59457655
:hypertensive patients with high pulse pressures should include a drug that is effective at reducing pulse pressure, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the best for this purpose.</ref>

===Effect of folic acid===
A 2005 study found that 5&nbsp;mg of [[folate]] daily over a three-week period reduced pulse pressure by 4.7&nbsp;mm of Hg compared with a placebo, and concluded that [[folic acid]] is an effective supplement that targets large artery stiffness and may prevent isolated systolic hypertension.<ref>Carolyn Williams, Bronwyn A Kingwell, Kevin Burke, Jane McPherson and Anthony M Dart: Folic acid supplementation for 3 wk reduces pulse pressure and large artery stiffness independent of MTHFR genotype.
