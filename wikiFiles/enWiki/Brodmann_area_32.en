The '''Brodmann area 32''', also known in the [[human]] [[brain]] as the '''dorsal anterior cingulate area 32''', refers to a subdivision of the [[Cytoarchitecture|cytoarchitecturally]] defined [[cingulate region]] of [[cerebral cortex]]. In the human it forms an outer arc around the [[anterior cingulate gyrus]].  The [[cingulate sulcus]] defines approximately its inner boundary and the [[superior rostral sulcus]] (H) its ventral boundary; rostrally it extends almost to the margin of the [[frontal lobe]]. Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded internally by the [[ventral anterior cingulate area 24]], externally by medial margins of the [[agranular frontal area 6]], [[intermediate frontal area 8]], [[granular frontal area 9]], [[frontopolar area 10]], and [[prefrontal area 11]]-1909. (Brodmann19-09). 

Dorsal region of anterior cingulate gyrus is associated with rational thought processes, most notably active during the [[Stroop task]].

In the [[guenon]] '''Brodmann area 32''' is a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined cingulate region of cerebral cortex. This area was named 25 in Brodmann-1905 and labeled 25 in a figure contributed by Brodmann in Mauss-1908. In Brodmann-1909, however, the area was labeled 32 and the name "area 25" was attached to the area that has since been the accepted [[Brodmann area 25|area 25 of Brodmann]]-1909 (Vogt-87). Distinguishing features according to Brodmann-1905: in contrast with [[Brodmann area 6|area 6 of Brodmann]]-1909 the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] of area 32 is relatively thick; the transition from cortex to [[white matter]] is more gradual; the distribution of cells is less dense; and there is no distinct boundary between the inner [[pyramidal layer]] (V) and the [[multiform layer]] (VI); it is similar to area 6 in the general absence of distinct layers, particularly of an internal [[granular layer]] (IV), but differs in that cells are smaller and there is an increased density of medium sized [[pyramidal cell]]s at the level of layer IV; this population of cells makes area 32 similar to the neighboring area 24 of Brodmann-1909; it differs from area 24 by its greater overall thickness and a particularly thick layer VI that merges gradually with the subcortical white matter. Brodmann-1909 regarded area 32 as [[topological]]ly, but not cytoarchitecturally, [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to the human dorsal anterior cingulate area 32; [[area 25 of Walker]]-1940 is topologically homologous to area 32.
