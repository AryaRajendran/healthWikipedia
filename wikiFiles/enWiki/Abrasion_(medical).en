In [[dermatology]], an '''abrasion''' is a [[wound]] caused by superficial damage to the [[skin]], no deeper than the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. It is less severe than a [[laceration]], and bleeding, if present, is minimal. Mild abrasions, also known as ''grazes'' or ''scrapes'', do not [[scar]] or bleed, but deep abrasions may lead to the formation of scar tissue. A more traumatic abrasion that removes all layers of skin is called an [[Avulsion injury|avulsion]].

Abrasion injuries most commonly occur when exposed skin comes into moving contact with a rough surface, causing a grinding or rubbing away of the upper layers of the epidermis.

==By degree==
* '''A first-degree abrasion''' involves only epidermal injury.
* '''A second-degree abrasion''' involves the epidermis as well as the dermis and may bleed slightly.
* '''A third-degree abrasion''' involves damage to the subcutaneous layer and the skin and is often called an ''[[avulsion injury|avulsion]]''.

==Treatment==
The abrasion should be cleaned and any debris removed. A topical [[antibiotic]] (such as [[Neosporin]] or [[bacitracin]]) should be applied to prevent infection and to keep the wound moist.<ref name="mosby">Kidd, P. S., Sturt, P. A., & Fultz, J. (2000). ''Mosby's emergency nursing reference'' (2nd ed.). St. Louis: Mosby, Inc.</ref> Dressing the wound is optional<ref name="mosby" /> but helps to keep the wound from drying out which interferes with [[Wound healing|healing]].<ref name="merck">[http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec21/ch308/ch308a.html?qt=abrasion&alt=sh#sec21-ch308-ch308a-96 Abrasions: Merck Manual Online]</ref> If the abrasion is painful, a topical [[analgesic]] (such as [[lidocaine]] or [[benzocaine]]) can be applied, but for large abrasions a systemic analgesic may be necessary.<ref name="mosby" /> Avoid exposing abraded skin to the sun as permanent hyperpigmentation can develop.
