'''Interventional cardiology''' is a branch of [[cardiology]] that deals specifically with the [[catheter]] based treatment of structural [[heart disease]]s. [[Andreas Gruentzig]] is considered the father of interventional cardiology after the development of angioplasty by [[interventional radiology|interventional radiologist]], [[Charles Dotter|Dr. Charles Dotter]].<ref name="pmid19740425">{{cite journal |author=Lakhan SE, Kaplan A, Laird C, Leiter Y |title=The interventionalism of medicine: interventional radiology, cardiology, and neuroradiology |journal=International Archives of Medicine |volume=2 |issue=27 |year=2009 |pmid=19740425 |doi=10.1186/1755-7682-2-27 |pages=27 |pmc=2745361}}</ref>

A large number of procedures can be performed on the [[heart]] by [[coronary catheterization|catheterization]]. This most commonly involves the insertion of a sheath into the [[femoral artery]] (but, in practice, any large peripheral artery or vein) and [[cannula|cannulating]] the heart under [[X-ray]] visualization (most commonly [[fluoroscopy]]). The [[radial artery]] may also be used for cannulation; this approach offers several advantages, including the accessibility of the artery in most patients, the easy control of bleeding even in anticoagulated patients, the enhancement of comfort because patients are capable of sitting up and walking immediately following the procedure, and the near absence of clinically significant sequelae in patients with a normal [[Allen test]].<ref name="isbn0-07-142264-1">{{cite book |author=Hurst, J. Willis; Fuster, Valentin; O'Rourke, Robert A. |title=Hurst's The Heart |publisher=McGraw-Hill, Medical Publishing Division |location=New York |year=2004 |pages=484 |isbn=0-07-142264-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=5Yl1LNe69lwC&pg=RA2-PA481#PRA2-PA484,M1}}</ref>

The main advantages of using the interventional cardiology or [[interventional radiology|radiology]] approach are the avoidance of the scars and pain, and long post-operative recovery. Additionally, interventional cardiology procedure of primary [[angioplasty]] is now the gold standard of care for an acute [[myocardial infarction]]. It involves the extraction of clots from occluded coronary arteries and deployment of stents and balloons through a small hole made in a major artery, which has given it the name "''pin-hole'' surgery" (as opposed to "''key-hole'' surgery").

Procedures performed by specialists in interventional cardiology:
; Angioplasty: Also called [[percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty]] (PTCA), [[angioplasty]] is an intervention for the treatment of [[coronary artery disease]].
; [[Valvuloplasty]]: It is the dilation of narrowed cardiac valves (usually [[mitral valve|mitral]], [[aortic valve|aortic]], or [[pulmonary valve|pulmonary]]).
; Congenital heart defect correction: Percutaneous approaches can be employed to correct [[atrial septal defect|atrial septal]] and [[ventricular septal defect]]s, closure of a [[patent ductus arteriosus]], and angioplasty of the great vessels.
: Percutaneous valve replacement: An alternative to [[open heart surgery]], percutaneous valve replacement is the [[valve replacement|replacement]] of a heart valve using percutaneous methods.
; Coronary thrombectomy: Coronary [[thrombectomy]] involves the removal of a [[thrombus]] (blood clot) from the [[coronary arteries]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enh.org/clinicalservices/cardiology/treatment/interventional/procedures/default.aspx?id=3631|title=Evanston Northwestern Hospital Interventional Cardiology|accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref>

Surgery of the heart is termed [[cardiothoracic surgery]]. Some interventional cardiology procedures are only performed when there is cardiothoracic surgery expertise in the hospital, in case of complications.
