'''Suicide intervention''' is a direct effort to prevent person(s) from attempting to take their own life intentionally. 

Most countries have some form of [[mental health law|mental health legislation]] which allows people expressing suicidal thoughts or intent to be detained [[involuntary commitment|involuntarily]] for [[psychiatric treatment]] when their judgment is deemed to be impaired.  These laws may grant the [[courts]], [[police]], or a [[medical doctor]] the power to order an individual to be apprehended to hospital for treatment.  This is sometimes referred to as being "[[involuntary commitment|committed]]".  The review of ongoing [[involuntary treatment]] may be conducted by the hospital, the courts, or a [[quasi-judicial body]], depending on the jurisdiction.

Mental health professionals and some other health professionals receive training in [[assessment of suicide risk|assessment]] and treatment  of suicidality. Suicide hotlines are widely available for people seeking help. However, some people may be reluctant to discuss their suicidal thoughts, due to [[social stigma|stigma]], previous negative experiences, or other reasons.

== First aid for suicide ideation ==

There are a number of myths about [[suicide]].  It is not usually unpredictable; in 75-80% of cases, the suicidal person has given some sort of warning sign.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Rosenthal H | title=12 Must-Know Myths About Suicidal Clients | journal=Counselor: The Magazine for Addictions Professionals | volume=4 | issue= | year=2003 | pages=22–23 }}</ref>  A key myth to dispel is that talking to someone about suicide increases the risk of suicide.  This is simply not true.<ref name=CARMHA>Centre for Applied Research in Mental Health and Addiction, [http://comh.ca//publications/resources/pub_wwcwis/WWCWIS.pdf "Working with the Client who is Suicidal"], 2007</ref>  If someone is expressing suicidal thoughts, he/she should be encouraged to seek mental health treatment.  Friends and family can provide supportive listening, [[empathy]], and encouragement to develop a safety plan.  Serious warning signs of imminent suicidal risk include a specific plan and intent to commit suicide, along with access to lethal means such as [[firearm]]s.<ref name=CARMHA/>  If a person expresses these warning signs, [[emergency service]]s should be contacted immediately.

Safety plans can include sources of support, [[emotional self-regulation|self-soothing]] activities, reasons for living (such as commitment to family, pets, etc.), and safe people to call and places to go.<ref name=CARMHA/>  When a person is feeling acutely distressed and overwhelmed by suicidal thoughts, it can be helpful to refer back to the safety plan.

== Mental health treatment ==

According to Chiles and Strosahl's 1995 Problem-Solving Model of Suicidal Behaviour, people attempt suicide when they experience the "three I's": intolerable, interminable, and inescapable pain and suffering.<ref name=CARMHA/>
Comprehensive approaches to suicidality include stabilization and safety, assessment of [[risk factors]], and ongoing management and [[problem solving#psychology|problem-solving]] around minimizing [[risk factors]] and bolstering [[protective factor]]s.<ref name=CARMHA/>  During the acute phase, admission to a [[psychiatric ward]] or [[involuntary commitment]] may be used in an attempt to ensure client safety, but the least restrictive means possible should be used.<ref name="APA guidelines">American Psychiatric Association, [http://psychiatryonline.org/content.aspx?bookid=28&sectionid=1673332 "Practice Guideline for Assessment and Treatment of Patients with Suicidal Behaviour], 2003</ref>  Treatment focuses on reducing [[suffering]] and enhancing [[coping skills]], and involves treatment of any underlying illness.

[[DSM-IV]] axis I disorders, particularly [[major depressive disorder]], and axis II disorders, particularly [[borderline personality disorder]], increase the risk of [[suicide]].<ref name=CARMHA/>  Individuals with [[dual diagnosis|co-occurring mental illness and substance use disorders]] are at increased risk compared to individuals with just one of the two disorders.<ref name="APA guidelines"/>  While [[antidepressant]]s may not directly decrease suicide risk in adults, they are in many cases effective at treating [[major depressive disorder]], and as such are recommended for patients with depression.<ref name="APA guidelines"/>  There is evidence that long-term [[lithium pharmacology|lithium]] therapy reduces suicide in individuals with [[bipolar disorder]] or [[major depressive disorder]].<ref name="APA guidelines"/>  [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT), or shock therapy, rapidly decreases suicidal thinking.<ref name="APA guidelines"/>  Choice of treatment approach is made based on the patient's presenting symptoms and history.  In cases where a patient is actively attempting suicide even while on a hospital ward, a fast-acting treatment such as [[electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]] may be [[first-line treatment|first-line]].

Ideally, family are involved in the ongoing support of the suicidal individual, and they can help to strengthen [[protective factor]]s and problem-solve around risk factors.  Both families and the suicidal person should be supported by health care providers to cope with the societal stigma surrounding mental illness and suicide. 

Attention should also be given to the suicidal person's [[culture|cultural]] background, as this can aid in understanding [[protective factor]]s and problem-solving approaches.  [[Risk factors]] may also arise related to membership in an oppressed minority group.  Aboriginal people may benefit from traditional Aboriginal healing techniques that facilitate a change in thinking, connection with tradition, and emotional expression.<ref>McCormack RM, Recovery from Suicide Ideation: Successful Healing Strategies as Described by Aboriginal Youth in Canada, unpublished manuscript, 1999</ref>

[[Psychotherapy]], particularly [[cognitive behavioural therapy]], is in important component in the management of suicide risk.<ref name="APA guidelines"/>  According to a 2005 [[randomized controlled trial]] by Gregory Brown, [[Aaron Beck]] and others, [[cognitive therapy]] can reduce repeat suicide attempts by 50%.<ref name="Brown_et_al_2005">''[http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/294/5/563 Cognitive Therapy for the Prevention of Suicide Attempts]'', Brown, G.K., [[Thomas Have|Have, T.T.]], [[Gregg Henriques|Henriques, G.R.]], [[Sharon Xie|Xie, S.X.]], [[Judd Hollander|Hollander, J.E.]], [[Aaron Beck|Beck, A.T.]], [[Journal of the American Medical Association]], 2005</ref>

=== Suicide prevention ===
{{Main|Suicide prevention}}

Various [[suicide prevention]] strategies have been suggested by mental-health professionals:<ref>See main article: [[Suicide prevention]].</ref>
* Promoting mental resilience through [[optimism]] and connectedness.
* Education about suicide, including risk factors, [[warning signs of suicide|warning signs]], and the availability of help.
* Increasing the proficiency of health and welfare services in responding to people in need. This includes better training for health professionals and employing crisis-counseling organizations.
* Reducing [[domestic violence]], [[substance abuse]], and [[divorce]] are long-term strategies to reduce many mental health problems.
* Reducing access to convenient means of suicide (e.g., toxic substances, [[handguns]], ropes/shoelaces).
* Reducing the quantity of dosages supplied in packages of non-prescription medicines e.g., [[aspirin]].
* Interventions targeted at high-risk groups.

===Research on suicide prevention ===
Research into suicide is published across a wide spectrum of journals dedicated to the [[Portal:Biology|biological]], [[Portal:Business and Economics|economic]], [[Portal:Psychology|psychological]], [[Portal:Medicine|medical]] and [[social sciences]]. In addition to those, a few journals are exclusively devoted to the study of suicide (suicidology), most notably, ''Crisis'', ''[[Suicide and Life Threatening Behavior]]'', and the ''Archives of Suicide Research''.
