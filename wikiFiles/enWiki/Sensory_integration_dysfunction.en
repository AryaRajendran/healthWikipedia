'''Sensory integration dysfunction''' (SID) is a hypothesized dysfunction of the vestibular system. It is characterized by increased or decreased sensitivity to stimuli.<ref>{{cite web|title=Signs, Symptoms and Background Information on Sensory Integration|url=http://www.incrediblehorizons.com/sensory-integration.htm|publisher=Incredible Horizons|accessdate=21 September 2012}}</ref> Currently, there is a movement to change the name of the dysfunction to [[Sensory Processing Disorder]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sensory-processing-disorder.com/|title=The Sensory Processing Disorder Resource Center|publisher=sensory-processing-disorder.com|accessdate=21 September 2012}}</ref> It is not a recognized diagnosis in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV-TR]] or the [[ICD|ICD-10]].

SID was first described in-depth by [[occupational therapist]] [[Anna Jean Ayres]] (1920–1989), who defined sensory integration as the ability to organize sensory information for use by the brain. According to Ayres's writings, an individual with SID would, therefore, have a decreased ability to organize sensory information as it comes in through the senses.<ref>Ayres, A. J. (2005).

==As a symptom==
Along with "sensory processing dysfunction," the term "sensory integration dysfunction" is used informally in the medical literature to describe any such difficulty. Various conditions can involve SID, such as [[schizophrenia]],<ref name=schiz1>{{cite pmid|17928202}}</ref><ref name=schiz2>{{cite pmid|17823650}}</ref><ref name=schiz3>{{cite pmid|11115328}}</ref> [[succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency]],<ref name=ssdd>{{cite pmid|19381864}}</ref> primary [[nocturnal enuresis]],<ref name=pne>{{cite pmid|18947482}}</ref> [[prenatal alcohol exposure]], [[learning difficulties]]<ref name=pna>*{{cite pmid|18269511}}</ref> and [[autism]],<ref name=aut1>{{cite pmid|19644746}}</ref><ref name=aut2>{{cite pmid|17436841}}</ref><ref name=aut3>{{cite pmid|17353213}}</ref> as well as people with [[traumatic brain injury]]<ref name=tbi>{{cite pmid|16823309}}</ref> or who have had [[cochlear implant]]s placed.<ref name=coch>{{cite pmid|19432059}}</ref>

==As a discrete dysfunction==
The concept of SID as a discrete [[mental disorder]] was popularized by [[Anna Jean Ayres]], a Californian [[occupational therapist]]. Since the 2005 publication of her monograph on the subject, some occupational therapists argue in favor of creating a discrete diagnostic category for SID,{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} but this position is disputed.<ref name=quackwatch>{{cite web |url=http://quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/sid.html |title= Why "sensory integration disorder" is a dubious diagnosis |author= Heilbroner PL |work=QuackWatch |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref><ref name=skeptical>{{cite journal |journal= [http://csicop.com/si/ Skeptical Inquirer] |year=2000 |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=56–57 |title= On inventing your own disorder |author= Newman B |url=http://csicop.com/si/2000-11/ |format= }} {{dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> SID is not listed as a recognized diagnosis in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV-TR]] or the [[ICD|ICD-10]].
