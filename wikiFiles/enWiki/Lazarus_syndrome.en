Occurrences of the syndrome are extremely rare and the causes are not well understood. One theory for the phenomenon is that a chief factor (though not the only one) is the buildup of pressure in the chest as a result of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The relaxation of pressure after resuscitation efforts have ended is thought to allow the heart to expand, triggering the heart's [[sinus rhythm|electrical impulses]] and restarting the heartbeat.<ref name="ben-david" /> Other possible factors are [[hyperkalemia]] or high doses of [[epinephrine]].<ref name="emj-report" />

== Cases ==
* A 61-year-old woman from Delaware, USA was given "multiple medicines and synchronized shocks", but never regained a pulse. She was declared dead but was discovered in the [[morgue]] to be alive and breathing. She sued the medical center where it happened for damages due to physical and neurological problems stemming from the event.<ref name="delaware-case">

* A 66-year-old man suffering from a suspected abdominal [[aneurysm]] who, during treatment for this condition, suffered [[cardiac arrest]] and received [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|chest compression]]s and [[defibrillation]] shocks for 17 minutes. Vital signs did not return; the patient was declared dead and resuscitation efforts ended. Ten minutes later, the surgeon felt a pulse. The aneurysm was successfully treated and the patient fully recovered with no lasting physical or neurological problems.<ref name="ben-david" />

* A 27 year-old man in the UK went into cardiac arrest after overdosing on [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]]. After 25 minutes of resuscitation efforts, the patient was verbally declared dead. About a minute after resuscitation ended, a nurse noticed a rhythm on the heart monitor and resuscitation was resumed. The patient recovered fully.<ref name="emj-report" />

* A 45 year-old woman in Colombia was pronounced dead, as there were no vital signs showing she was alive. Later, a funeral worker noticed the woman moving and alerted his co-worker that the woman should go back to the hospital.<ref>http://uk.news.yahoo.com/4/20100219/twl-dead-woman-comes-back-to-life-41f21e0.html.{{Dead link|date=December 2010}}  Retrieved 19 Feb 2010</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/america_latina/2010/02/100218_2118_colombia_resurrecion_gz.shtml|title=¿Colombiana experimentó Síndrome de Lázaro?|last=Salazar|first=Hernando|work=[[BBC Online]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref>

== Implications ==
The Lazarus Syndrome raises ethical issues for doctors, who must determine when medical death has occurred, resuscitation efforts should end, and post-mortem procedures such as [[autopsy|autopsies]] and [[organ harvesting]] may take place.<ref name="ben-david" /> One doctor wrote, "Perhaps it is a supreme [[hubris]] on our part to presume that we can reliably distinguish the reversible from the irreversible, or the salvageable from the nonsalvageable."<ref name="ben-david" />

Medical literature has recommended observation of a patient's vital signs for five to ten minutes after cessation of resuscitation before certifying death.<ref name="emj-report" />
