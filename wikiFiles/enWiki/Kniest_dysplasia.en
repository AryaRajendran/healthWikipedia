'''Kniest dysplasia''' is an uncommon inherited disorder of [[bone]] growth. The condition is characterized by [[dwarfism]], enlarged joints, and other skeletal abnormalities, and problems with [[Visual perception|vision]] and [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. Kniest dysplasia is a subtype of [[collagenopathy, types II and XI]].

==Presentation==
People with this condition are short-statured from birth, with a short trunk, shortened limbs, and large joints. Adult height ranges from 107 to 147 cm (42 inches to 58 inches). Progressive joint enlargement and pain restrict joint movement, which limits activity and interferes with standing and walking. These joint problems can also lead to [[arthritis]]. Other skeletal signs include a progressively shortened [[vertebral column|spine]] due to spinal curvature ([[kyphoscoliosis]] and [[lumbar lordosis]]), severely flattened bones of the spine ([[platyspondyly]]), dumbbell-shaped bones in the arms and legs, long and knobby fingers, and occasionally a foot deformity called [[clubfoot]].

People with Kniest dysplasia have round, flat faces with prominent and wide-set eyes. Some infants are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (a [[cleft palate]]). Infants may also have breathing problems due to weakness of the windpipe. Severe nearsightedness ([[myopia]]) is common, as are other eye problems that can lead to blindness. Hearing loss resulting from recurrent ear infections is also possible.

==Genetics==
Kniest dysplasia is one of a spectrum of skeletal disorders caused by mutations in the ''[[COL2A1 gene|COL2A1]]'' gene. The protein made by this gene forms type II [[collagen]], a molecule found mostly in [[cartilage]] and in the clear gel that fills the eyeball (the [[vitreous humour|vitreous]]). Type II collagen is essential for the normal development of bones and other [[Connective Tissues]]. Mutations in the [[COL2A1 gene]] that cause Kniest dysplasia interfere with the assembly of type II collagen molecules, which prevents bones from developing properly and causes the signs and symptoms of the disorder.

Kniest dysplasia is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] pattern, which means only one copy of the altered gene is necessary to cause the disorder.

==Eponynm==
It is named for Wilhelm Kniest.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2170}}</ref>
