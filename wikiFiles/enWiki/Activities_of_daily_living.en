'''Activities of daily living''' (ADLs) is a term used in healthcare to refer to daily self-care activities within an individual's place of residence, in outdoor environments, or both. [[Health professional]]s routinely refer to the ability or inability to perform ADLs as a measurement of the functional status of a person, particularly in regards to people with [[Disability|disabilities]] and the [[Old age|elderly]].<ref name=EN>"Activities of Daily Living Evaluation." ''Encyclopedia of Nursing & Allied Health''. ed. Kristine Krapp. Gale Group, Inc., 2002. eNotes.com. 2006.[http://www.enotes.com/nursing-encyclopedia/activities-daily-living-evaluation Enotes Nursing Encyclopedia] Accessed on: 11 Oct, 2007</ref>

ADLs are defined as "the things we normally do...such as feeding ourselves, bathing, dressing, grooming, work, homemaking, and leisure."<ref name =MN>[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2152 MedicineNet.com Medical Dictionary]</ref> A number of national surveys collect data on the ADL status of the U.S. population.<ref name =NCHS>[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/datawh/nchsdefs/ADL.htm National Center for Health Statistics]</ref> While basic categories of ADLs have been suggested, what specifically constitutes a particular ADL in a particular environment for a particular person may vary.

== Basic ADLs ==

Basic ADLs (BADLs) consist of self-care tasks, including:<ref name=OTPF>{{cite journal |author=Roley SS, DeLany JV, Barrows CJ, ''et al.'' |title=Occupational therapy practice framework: domain & practice, 2nd edition |journal=Am J Occup Ther |volume=62 |issue=6 |pages=625â€“83 |year=2008 |pmid=19024744 |url=http://ajot.aotapress.net/content/62/6/625.full.pdf+html}}</ref>

* [[Bathing]] and [[showering]] (washing the body)
* Bowel and bladder management (recognizing the need to relieve oneself)
* [[clothing|Dressing]]
* Eating (including chewing and swallowing)
* Feeding (setting up food and bringing it to the mouth)
* Functional mobility (moving from one place to another while performing activities)
* Personal device care
* [[Personal hygiene]] and [[Personal grooming|grooming]] (including [[washing hair]])
* [[Human sexual activity|Sexual activity]]
* Toilet hygiene (completing the act of [[relieving oneself]])

A useful mnemonic is DEATH: dressing, eating, ambulating, toileting, hygiene.<ref name=UOttawa>{{cite website|title=Activities of Daily Living|date=2011-08-26|url=http://www.medicine.uottawa.ca/sim/data/Disability_ADL_e.htm}}</ref>

== Instrumental ADLs ==
Instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) are not necessary for fundamental functioning, but they let an individual live independently in a community:<ref name=FGH>Bookman, A., Harrington, M., Pass, L., & Reisner, E. (2007). ''Family Caregiver Handbook''. Cambridge, MA: Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</ref>

* [[Housework]]
* Taking medications as prescribed
* Managing money
* [[Shopping]] for groceries or clothing
* Use of telephone or other form of communication
* Using technology (as applicable)
* Transportation within the community

A useful mnemonic is SHAFT: shopping, housekeeping, accounting, food preparation/meds, telephone/transportation.

[[Occupational therapy|Occupational therapist]]s often evaluate IADLs when completing patient assessments.  The [[American Occupational Therapy Association]] identifies 12 types of IADLs that may be performed as a co-occupation with others:<ref name=OTPF></ref>

* Care of others (including selecting and supervising caregivers)
* Care of pets
* Child rearing
* Communication management
* Community mobility
* Financial management
* Health management and maintenance
* Home establishment and maintenance
* Meal preparation and cleanup
* Religious observances
* Safety procedures and emergency responses
* Shopping

== Evaluation of ADLs ==

There are several evaluation tools, such as the [[Katz ADL scale]],<ref>[http://son.uth.tmc.edu/coa/FDGN_1/RESOURCES/ADLandIADL.pdf Katz ADL scale]</ref> the [[Lawton IADL scale]].<ref>[http://www.abramsoncenter.org/PRI/documents/IADL.pdf Lawton IADL scale]</ref> and the [[Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale]].

Most models of health care service use ADL evaluations in their practice, including the medical (or institutional) models, such as the [[Roper-Logan-Tierney model of nursing]], and the resident-centered models, such as the [[Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly]] (PACE).
