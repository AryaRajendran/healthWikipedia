'''Oneirophrenia''' is a [[hallucinatory]], [[dream]]-like state caused by several conditions such as prolonged [[sleep deprivation]], [[sensory deprivation]], or drugs (such as [[ibogaine]]). From the [[Greek language|Greek]] words "[[wikt:ὄνειρο|ὄνειρο]]" (''oneiro'', "dream") and "[[wikt:φρήν|φρενός]]" (''phrenos'', "mind"). It has some of the characteristics of simple [[schizophrenia]], such as a [[confusion|confusional state]] and clouding of [[consciousness]], but without presenting the [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociative]] symptoms which are typical of this disorder.

Persons affected by oneirophrenia have a feeling of dream-like [[derealization]] which, in its extreme form, may progress to [[delusion]]s and [[hallucination]]s. Therefore, it is considered a schizophrenia-like acute form of [[psychosis]] which remits in about 60% of cases within a period of two years. It is estimated that 50% or more of schizophrenic patients present oneirophrenia at least once.

Oneirophrenic patients are resistant to [[insulin]] and when injected with [[glucose]], these patients take 30 to 50% longer to return to normal [[Glucose|glycemia]]. The meaning of this finding is not known, but it has been hypothesized that it may be due to an insulin antagonist present in the blood during psychosis.

Oneirophrenia was studied in the 1950s by the neurologist and psychiatrist [[Ladislas J. Meduna]] (1896-1964), also known as the discoverer of one of the forms of [[Insulin shock therapy|shock therapy]], using the drug [[metrazol]].

[[Psychoanalyst]]s, such as [[Claudio Naranjo]], in the sixties have described the value of [[ibogaine]]-induced oneirophrenia for inducing and manipulating free fantasy and dream-like associations in patients under treatment.

Although it is still cited in diagnostic manuals of [[psychiatry]], such as [[DSM-IV]] and in the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD), oneirophrenia as a separate entity is out of fashion nowadays.
