[[File:X-ray applications.svg|thumb|500px|X-rays are part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], with wavelengths shorter than [[visible light]]. Different applications use different parts of the X-ray spectrum.]]

'''X-radiation''' (composed of '''X-rays''') is a form of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. X-rays have a [[wavelength]] in the range of 0.01 to 10 [[nanometer]]s, corresponding to [[frequency|frequencies]] in the range 30 [[Hertz|petahertz]] to 30 [[Hertz|exahertz]] (3×10<sup>16</sup> Hz to 3×10<sup>19</sup> Hz) and energies in the range 100 [[Electronvolt|eV]] to 100 [[keV]]. The wavelengths are shorter than those of [[Ultraviolet|UV]] rays and longer than of [[gamma ray]]s. In many languages, X-radiation is called '''''Röntgen radiation''''', after [[Wilhelm Röntgen]],<ref>{{cite web|title=X-Rays|url=http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/11_xrays.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> who is usually credited as its discoverer, and who had named it ''X-radiation'' to signify an unknown type of radiation.<ref name="squires">Novelline, Robert.

X-rays with photon energies above 5-10 keV (below 0.2-0.1&nbsp;nm wavelength) are called ''hard X-rays'', while those with lower energy are called ''soft X-rays''.<ref name="Attwood">{{cite book

As a result, the term ''X-ray'' is [[metonymy|metonymically]] used to refer to a [[radiographic]] image produced using this method, in addition to the method itself. Since the wavelengths of hard X-rays are similar to the size of atoms they are also useful for determining crystal structures by [[X-ray crystallography]]. By contrast, soft X-rays are easily absorbed in air and the [[attenuation length]] of 600 eV (~2&nbsp;nm) X-rays in water is less than 1 micrometer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/ffast/ffast.pl?Formula=H2O&gtype=5&range=S&lower=0.300&upper=2.00&density=1.00 |title=Physics.nist.gov |publisher=Physics.nist.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref> 

The distinction between X-rays and gamma rays is not universal. One often sees the two types of radiation separated by their origin: X-rays are emitted by [[electron]]s, while gamma rays are emitted by the [[atomic nucleus]].<ref name="Dendy">{{cite book

==Properties==
[[Image:Radioactive.svg|thumb|120px|Ionizing radiation hazard symbol]]
X-ray [[photons]] carry enough energy to [[ionize]] atoms and disrupt [[molecular bond]]s. This makes it a type of [[ionizing radiation]] and thereby harmful to living [[Tissue (anatomy)|tissue]]. A very high [[radiation dose]] over a short amount of time causes [[radiation sickness]], while lower doses can give an increased risk of [[radiation-induced cancer]]. In medical imaging this increased cancer risk is generally greatly outweighed by the benefits of the examination. The ionizing capability of X-rays can be utilized in [[Oncology|cancer treatment]] to kill [[malignant]] [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s using [[radiation therapy]]. It is also used for material characterization using [[X-ray spectroscopy]].

[[File:Attenuation.svg|thumb|[[Attenuation length]] of X-rays in water showing the oxygen [[absorption edge]] at 540 eV, the energy<sup>-3</sup> dependence of [[Photoelectric effect|photoabsorption]], as well as a leveling off at higher photon energies due to [[Compton scattering]]. The attenuation length is about four orders of magnitude higher for hard X-rays (right half) compared to soft X-rays (left half).]]

Hard X-rays can traverse relatively thick objects without being much [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] or [[Scattering|scattered]]. For this reason X-rays are widely used to [[Imaging science|image]] the inside of visually opaque objects. The most often seen applications are in medical [[radiography]] and [[airport security]] scanners, but similar techniques are also important in industry (e.g. [[industrial radiography]] and [[industrial CT scanning]]) and research (e.g. [[Small animal imaging#Micro-CT|small animal CT]]). The [[penetration depth]] varies with several [[orders of magnitude]] over the X-ray spectrum. This allows the photon energy to be adjusted for the application so as to give sufficient [[Transmittance|transmission]] through the object and at the same time good [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]] in the image.

X-rays have much shorter wavelength than visible light, which makes it possible to probe structures much smaller than what can be seen using a normal [[microscope]]. This can be used in [[X-ray microscopy]] to acquire high resolution images, but also in [[X-ray crystallography]] to determine the positions of [[atoms]] in [[crystals]].

==Interaction with matter==
X-rays interact with matter in three main ways, through [[Photoelectric effect|photoabsorption]], [[Compton scattering]], and [[Rayleigh scattering]]. The strength of these interactions depend on the energy of the X-rays and the elemental composition of the material, but not much on chemical properties since the X-ray photon energy is much higher than chemical binding energies. Photoabsorption or photoelectric absorption is the dominant interaction mechanism in the soft X-ray regime and for the lower hard X-ray energies. At higher energies the compton effect dominates.

===Photoelectric absorption===
The probability of a photoelectric absorption per unit mass is approximately proportional to ''Z''<sup>3</sup>/''E''<sup>3</sup>, where ''Z'' is the atomic number and ''E'' is the energy of the incident photon.<ref>{{cite book
  | author = Jerrold T. Bushberg, J. Anthony Seibert, Edwin M. Leidholdt, and John M. Boone

  | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins
  | year = 2002
  | isbn = 978-0-683-30118-2
  | url = 
  | page = 42}}</ref> This rule is not valid close to inner shell electron binding energies where there are abrupt changes in interaction probability, so called [[absorption edges]]. However, the general trend of high [[absorption coefficient]]s and thus short [[penetration depth]]s for low photon energies and high atomic numbers is very strong. For soft tissue photoabsorption dominates up to about 26 keV photon energy where Compton scattering takes over. For higher atomic number substances this limit is higher. The high amount of calcium (''Z''=20) in bones together with their high density is what makes them show up so clearly on medical radiographs.

A photoabsorbed photon transfers all its energy to the electron with which it interacts, thus ionizing the atom to which the electron was bound and producing a photoelectron that is likely to ionize more atoms in its path. An outer electron will fill the vacant electron position and the produce either a [[Emission line|characteristic photon]] or an [[Auger electron]]. These effects can be used for elemental detection through [[X-ray spectroscopy]] or [[Auger electron spectroscopy]].

===Compton scattering===
Compton scattering is the predominant interaction between X-rays and soft tissue in medical imaging.<ref>{{cite book
  | author = Jerrold T. Bushberg, J. Anthony Seibert, Edwin M. Leidholdt, and John M. Boone

  | year = 2002
  | isbn = 978-0-683-30118-2
  | url = 
  | page = 38}}</ref> Compton scattering is an [[inelastic scattering]] of the X-ray photon by an outer shell electron. Part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the scattering electron, thereby ionizing the atom and increasing the wavelength of the X-ray. The scattered photon can go in any direction, but a direction similar to the original direction is a bit more likely, especially for high-energy X-rays. The probability for different scattering angles are described by the [[Klein–Nishina formula]]. The transferred energy can be directly obtained from the scattering angle from the [[conservation of energy]] and [[conservation of momentum|momentum]].

===Rayleigh scattering===
Rayleigh scattering is the dominant [[elastic scattering]] mechanism in the X-ray regime.<ref>{{cite web

[[Image:TubeSpectrum.jpg|thumb| Spectrum of the X-rays emitted by an X-ray tube with a [[rhodium]] target, operated at 60 [[kilovolt|kV]]. The smooth, continuous curve is due to ''[[bremsstrahlung]]'', and the spikes are [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|characteristic K lines]] for rhodium atoms.]]

Since X-rays are emitted by electrons, they can be generated by an [[X-ray tube]], a [[vacuum tube]] that uses a high voltage to accelerate the [[electron]]s released by a [[hot cathode]] to a high velocity. The high velocity electrons collide with a metal target, the [[anode]], creating the X-rays.<ref>{{cite book

 |isbn = 0-443-07027-X}}</ref> In medical X-ray tubes the target is usually [[tungsten]] or a more crack-resistant alloy of [[rhenium]] (5%) and tungsten (95%), but sometimes [[molybdenum]] for more specialized applications, such as when softer X-rays are needed as in mammography. In crystallography, a [[copper]] target is most common, with [[cobalt]] often being used when fluorescence from [[iron]] content in the sample might otherwise present a problem.

The maximum energy of the produced X-ray [[photon]] is limited by the energy of the incident electron, which is equal to the voltage on the tube times the electron charge, so an 80&nbsp;kV tube cannot create X-rays with an energy greater than 80&nbsp;keV. When the electrons hit the target, X-rays are created by two different atomic processes:
#[[X-ray fluorescence]]: If the electron has enough energy it can knock an orbital electron out of the inner [[electron shell]] of a metal atom, and as a result electrons from higher energy levels then fill up the vacancy and X-ray photons are emitted. This process produces an [[emission spectrum]] of X-rays at a few discrete frequencies, sometimes referred to as the spectral lines. The spectral lines generated depend on the target (anode) element used and thus are called characteristic lines. Usually these are transitions from upper shells into K shell (called [[K-alpha|K lines]]), into L shell (called L lines) and so on.
#''[[Bremsstrahlung]]'': This is radiation given off by the electrons as they are scattered by the strong electric field near the high-''Z'' ([[proton]] number) nuclei. These X-rays have a [[continuous spectrum]]. The intensity of the X-rays increases linearly with decreasing frequency, from zero at the energy of the incident electrons, the voltage on the [[X-ray tube]].
So the resulting output of a tube consists of a continuous bremsstrahlung spectrum falling off to zero at the tube voltage, plus several spikes at the characteristic lines. The voltages used in diagnostic X-ray tubes range from roughly 20 to 150 kV and thus the highest energies of the X-ray photons range from roughly 20 to 150 keV.<ref>{{cite book

Both of these X-ray production processes are inefficient, with a production efficiency of only about one percent, and hence, to produce a usable flux of X-rays, most of the [[electric power]] consumed by the tube is released as waste heat. The X-ray tube must be designed to dissipate this excess heat.

Short nanosecond bursts of X-rays peaking at 15-keV in energy may be reliably produced by peeling pressure-sensitive adhesive tape from its backing in a moderate vacuum. This is likely to be the result of recombination of electrical charges produced by [[Triboelectric effect|triboelectric charging]]. The intensity of X-ray [[triboluminescence]] is sufficient for it to be used as a source for X-ray imaging.<ref name=Camara2008>{{cite journal|last=Camara|first=C. G.|coauthors=Escobar, J.

==Detectors==
{{Main|X-ray detector}}
X-ray detectors vary in shape and function depending on their purpose. Imaging detectors such as those used for [[radiography]] were originally based on [[photographic plate]]s and later [[photographic film]] but are now mostly replaced by various [[digital]] detector types such as [[image plate]]s or [[flat panel detectors]]. For [[radiation protection]] direct exposure hazard is often evaluated using [[ionization chamber]]s, while [[dosimeters]] are used to measure the [[radiation dose]] a person has been exposed to. X-ray [[Energy spectrum|spectra]] can be measured either by energy dispersive or wavelength dispersive [[spectrometer]]s.

==Medical uses==
{{main|Medical imaging}}
[[File:Radiografía pulmones Francisca Lorca.cropped.jpg|thumb|175px|A [[chest radiograph]] of a female, demonstrating a [[hiatus hernia]]]]

Since Röntgen's discovery that X-rays can identify bone structures, X-rays have been used for [[medical imaging]]. The first medical use was less than a month after his paper on the subject.<ref name = PKS/> In 2010, 5&nbsp;billion medical imaging studies were done worldwide.<ref name="Roobottom CA, Mitchell G, Morgan-Hughes G 2010 859–67">{{cite journal |author=Roobottom CA, Mitchell G, Morgan-Hughes G |title=Radiation-reduction strategies in cardiac computed tomographic angiography |journal=Clin Radiol |volume=65 |issue=11 |pages=859–67 |year=2010|pmid=20933639 |doi=10.1016/j.crad.2010.04.021 }}</ref> Radiation exposure from medical imaging in 2006 made up about 50% of total ionizing radiation exposure in the United States.<ref name=Science09/>

===Radiographs===
{{main|Radiography}}
A radiograph is an X-ray image obtained by placing a part of the patient in front of an X-ray detector and then illuminating it with a short X-ray pulse. Bones contain much [[calcium]], which due to its relatively high [[atomic number]] absorbes x-rays efficiently. This reduces the amount of X-rays reaching the detector in the shadow of the bones, making them clearly visible on the radiograph. The lungs and trapped gas also show up clearly because of lower absorption compared to tissue, while differences between tissue types are harder to see.

Radiographs are useful in the detection of [[pathology]] of the [[bone|skeletal system]] as well as for detecting some disease processes in [[soft tissue]]. Some notable examples are the very common [[chest radiograph|chest X-ray]], which can be used to identify lung diseases such as [[pneumonia]], [[lung cancer]] or [[pulmonary edema]], and the [[abdominal x-ray]], which can detect [[bowel obstruction|bowel (or intestinal) obstruction]], free air (from visceral perforations) and free fluid (in [[ascites]]). X-rays may also be used to detect pathology such as [[gallstone]]s (which are rarely [[radiodensity|radiopaque]]) or [[kidney stone]]s which are often (but not always) visible. Traditional plain X-rays are less useful in the imaging of soft tissues such as the [[Human brain|brain]] or [[muscle]]. 

[[Dental radiography]] is commonly used in the diagnoses of common oral problems, such as [[Dental caries|cavities]].

In medical diagnostic applications, the low energy (soft) X-rays are unwanted, since they are totally absorbed by the body, increasing the radiation dose without contributing to the image. Hence, a thin metal sheet, often of [[aluminium]], called an [[X-ray filter]], is usually placed over the window of the X-ray tube, absorbing the low energy part in the spectrum. This is called ''hardening'' the beam since it shifts the center of the spectrum towards higher energy (or harder) x-rays.

To generate an image of the [[Cardiovascular_system#Human_cardiovascular_system|cardiovascular system]], including the arteries and veins ([[angiography]]) an initial image is taken of the anatomical region of interest. A second image is then taken of the same region after an iodinated [[Radiocontrast agent|contrast agent]] has been injected into the blood vessels within this area. These two images are then digitally subtracted, leaving an image of only the iodinated contrast outlining the blood vessels. The [[radiology|radiologist]] or [[surgeon]] then compares the image obtained to normal anatomical images to determine if there is any damage or blockage of the vessel.

===Computed tomography===
[[File:Brain CT scan.jpg|thumb|175px|Head [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]] ([[transverse plane]]) slice -– a modern application of [[medical radiography]]]]
[[Computed tomography]] (CT scanning) is a medical imaging modality where [[Tomography|tomographic images]] or slices of specific areas of the body are obtained from a large series of two-dimensional X-ray images taken in different directions.<ref name="ref1">{{Cite book|last = Herman|first = Gabor T.|authorlink=Gabor Herman|title = Fundamentals of Computerized Tomography: Image Reconstruction from Projections|year = 2009|publisher = Springer|edition=2nd|isbn=978-1-85233-617-2|postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> These cross-sectional images can be combined into a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] image of the inside of the body and used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in various medical disciplines.

===Fluoroscopy===
[[Fluoroscopy]] is an imaging technique commonly used by [[physicians]] or [[radiation therapist]]s to obtain real-time moving images of the internal structures of a patient through the use of a fluoroscope. In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and fluorescent screen between which a patient is placed. However, modern fluoroscopes couple the screen to an [[X-ray image intensifier]] and [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] [[video camera]] allowing the images to be recorded and played on a monitor. This method may use a contrast material. Examples include cardiac catheterization (to examine for [[coronary circulation|coronary artery blockages]]) and barium swallow (to examine for [[esophageal disorder]]s).

===Radiotherapy===
The use of X-rays as a treatment is known as [[radiation therapy]] and is largely used for the management (including [[palliation]]) of [[cancer]]; it requires higher radiation energies than for imaging alone.

==Adverse effects==

Medical X-rays are a significant source of man-made radiation exposure. In 1987, they accounted for 58% of exposure from man-made sources in the [[United States]]. Since man-made sources accounted for only 18% of the total radiation exposure, most of which came from natural sources (82%), medical X-rays only accounted for 10% of ''total'' American radiation exposure; medical procedures as a whole (including [[nuclear medicine]]) accounted for 14% of total radiation exposure. By 2006, however, medical procedures in the United States were contributing much more ionizing radiation than was the case in the early 1980s. In 2006, medical exposure constituted nearly half of the total radiation exposure of the U.S. population from all sources. The increase is traceable to the growth in the use of medical imaging procedures, in particular [[computed tomography]] (CT), and to the growth in the use of nuclear medicine.<ref name=Science09>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090303125809.htm Medical Radiation Exposure Of The U.S. Population Greatly Increased Since The Early 1980s], Science Daily, March 5, 2009</ref><ref>{{cite book

Dosage due to dental X-rays varies significantly depending on the procedure and the technology (film or digital). Depending on the procedure and the technology, a single dental X-ray of a human results in an exposure of 0.5 to 4 mrem. A full mouth series may therefore result in an exposure of up to 6 (digital) to 18 (film) mrem, for a yearly average of up to 40 mrem.<ref>[http://www.new.ans.org/pi/resources/dosechart/ American Nuclear Society Radiation Dose Chart]</ref><ref>[http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/chapter5.html ''The Nuclear Energy Option'', Bernard Cohen, Plenum Press 1990 Ch. 5]</ref><ref>Muller, Richard.

===Discovery===
[[File:WilhelmRöntgen.JPG|thumb|170px|Wilhelm Röntgen]]
German physicist [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] is usually credited as the discoverer of X-rays in 1895, because he was the first to systematically study them, though he is not the first to have observed their effects. He is also the one who gave them the name "X-rays", though many referred to these as "Röntgen rays" (and the associated [[Radiography|X-ray radiograms]] as, "Röntgenograms") for several decades after their discovery and even to this day in some languages, including Röntgen's native [[German language|German]].

X-rays were found emanating from [[Crookes tube]]s, experimental [[discharge tube]]s invented around 1875, by scientists investigating the [[cathode ray]]s, that is energetic [[electron]] beams, that were first created in the tubes. Crookes tubes created free electrons by [[ionization]] of the residual air in the tube by a high DC [[voltage]] of anywhere between a few [[kilovolt]]s and 100 kV. This voltage accelerated the electrons coming from the [[cathode]] to a high enough velocity that they created X-rays when they struck the [[anode]] or the glass wall of the tube. Many of the early Crookes tubes undoubtedly radiated X-rays, because early researchers noticed effects that were attributable to them, as detailed below. Wilhelm Röntgen was the first to systematically study them, in 1895.<ref>The history, development, and impact of computed imaging in neurological diagnosis and neurosurgery: CT, MRI, DTI: [http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3267/version/5 Nature Precedings ] {{doi|10.1038/npre.2009.3267.5}}.</ref>

===Early research===
The important early researchers in X-rays were [[Ivan Pulyui]], [[William Crookes]], [[Johann Wilhelm Hittorf]], [[Eugen Goldstein]], [[Heinrich Hertz]], [[Philipp Lenard]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Charles Glover Barkla]], [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Max von Laue]], and [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]].

German physicist [[Johann Hittorf]] (1824–1914), a co-inventor and early researcher of the Crookes tube, found when he placed unexposed [[photographic plate]]s near the tube, that some of them were flawed by shadows, though he did not investigate this effect.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In 1877 [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]-born [[Ivan Pulyui|Pulyui]], a lecturer in experimental physics at the [[University of Vienna]], constructed various designs of [[Crookes tube|vacuum discharge tube]] to investigate their properties.<ref name=mayo>{{cite web

Early in 1896, just a few weeks after [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen|Röntgen]] published his first X-ray photograph, Pulyui published high-quality X-ray images in journals in Paris and London.<ref name=mayo/> Although Pulyui had studied with Röntgen at the [[University of Strasbourg]] in the years 1873–75, his biographer Gaida (1997) asserts that his subsequent research was conducted independently.<ref name=mayo/>

In April 1887, [[Nikola Tesla]] began to investigate X-rays using high voltages and tubes of his own design, as well as [[Crookes tube]]s. From his technical publications, it is indicated that he invented and developed a special single-electrode X-ray tube,<ref>Morton, William James, and Edwin W. Hammer, American Technical Book Co., 1896. p. 68.</ref><ref>{{US patent|514170}}, ''Incandescent Electric Light'', and {{US patent|454622}}, ''System of Electric Lighting''.</ref> which differed from other X-ray tubes in having no target electrode and worked with the output of [[Tesla coil|Tesla Coil]]. The principle behind Tesla's device is called the [[Bremsstrahlung]] process, in which a high-energy secondary X-ray emission is produced when charged particles (such as electrons) pass through matter. By 1892, Tesla performed several such experiments, but he did not categorize the emissions as what were later called X-rays. Tesla generalized the phenomenon as [[radiant energy]] of "invisible" kinds.<ref>Cheney, Margaret, "[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0743215362 Tesla: Man Out of Time]".

X-rays were generated and detected by [[Fernando Sanford]] (1854–1948), the foundation Professor of Physics at [[Stanford University]], in 1891. From 1886 to 1888 he had studied in the [[Hermann Helmholtz]] laboratory in Berlin, where he became familiar with the cathode rays generated in vacuum tubes when a voltage was applied across separate electrodes, as previously studied by [[Heinrich Hertz]] and [[Philipp Lenard]]. His letter of January 6, 1893 (describing his discovery as "electric photography") to The [[Physical Review]] was duly published and an article entitled ''Without Lens or Light, Photographs Taken With Plate and Object in Darkness'' appeared in the [[San Francisco Examiner]].<ref>{{cite journal |last= Wyman|first=Thomas |year=2005 |month= Spring |title=Fernando Sanford and the Discovery of X-rays |journal= "Imprint", from the Associates of the Stanford University Libraries |pages=5–15}}</ref>

[[Philipp Lenard]], a student of Heinrich Hertz, wanted to see whether cathode rays could pass out of the Crookes tube into the air. He built a Crookes tube (later called a "Lenard tube") with a "window" in the end made of thin aluminum, facing the cathode so the cathode rays would strike it.<ref name="Thomson">{{cite book

It has been suggested that at least some of these "Lenard rays" were actually X-rays.<ref>Thomson, 1903, p.185</ref>

[[Hermann von Helmholtz]] formulated mathematical equations for X-rays. He postulated a dispersion theory before Röntgen made his discovery and announcement. It was formed on the basis of the electromagnetic theory of light.<ref>''Wiedmann's Annalen'', Vol. XLVIII</ref> However, he did not work with actual X-rays.

On November 8, 1895, [[Germany|German]] physics professor [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] stumbled on X-rays while experimenting with [[Philipp Lenard|Lenard]] and [[Crookes tube]]s and began studying them. He wrote an initial report "''On a new kind of ray: A preliminary communication''" and on December 28, 1895 submitted it to the [[Würzburg]]'s Physical-Medical Society journal.<ref>{{Cite journal

Röntgen referred to the radiation as "X", to indicate that it was an unknown type of radiation. The name stuck, although (over Röntgen's great objections) many of his colleagues suggested calling them '''Röntgen rays'''. They are still referred to as such in many languages, including German, Swedish, Finnish, Russian, Japanese, Dutch, and Norwegian.

He noticed a faint green glow from the screen, about 1 meter away. Röntgen realized some invisible rays coming from the tube were passing through the cardboard to make the screen glow. He found they could also pass through books and papers on his desk. Röntgen threw himself into investigating these unknown rays systematically. Two months after his initial discovery, he published his paper.

Röntgen discovered its medical use when he made a picture of his wife's hand on a photographic plate formed due to X-rays. The photograph of his wife's hand was the first ever photograph of a human body part using X-rays.

In 1895, [[Thomas Edison]] investigated materials' ability to fluoresce when exposed to X-rays, and found that [[calcium tungstate]] was the most effective substance. Around March 1896, the [[Fluoroscopy|fluoroscope]] he developed became the standard for medical X-ray examinations. Nevertheless, Edison dropped X-ray research around 1903, even before the death of [[Clarence Madison Dally]], one of his glassblowers. Dally had a habit of testing X-ray tubes on his hands, and acquired a [[cancer]] in them so tenacious that both arms were [[amputation|amputated]] in a futile attempt to save his life.

In 1901, [[Assassination of William McKinley|U.S. President William McKinley was shot twice]] in an [[assassination]] attempt. While one bullet only grazed his [[sternum]], another had lodged somewhere deep inside his [[abdomen]] and could not be found. "A worried McKinley aide sent word to inventor Thomas Edison to rush an [[X-ray machine]] to Buffalo to find the stray bullet. It arrived but wasn't used." While the shooting itself had not been lethal, "[[gangrene]] had developed along the path of the bullet, and McKinley died of [[septic shock]] due to bacterial infection" six days later.<ref>National Library of Medicine.

The first use of X-rays under clinical conditions was by [[John Hall-Edwards]] in [[Birmingham]], [[England]] on 11 January 1896, when he radiographed a needle stuck in the hand of an associate.<ref>{{cite book|last=Meggitt|first=Geoff|title=Taming the Rays: a history of radiation and protection|year=2008|publisher=lulu.com|isbn=1409246671|page=3 }}</ref> On 14 February 1896 Hall-Edwards was also the first to use X-rays in a surgical operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/xray|title=Major John Hall-Edwards|accessdate=2012-05-17|publisher=Birmingham City Council }}</ref>

Having heard of Wilhelm Röntgen's discovery, and whilst still at Winchester School, England, Russel Reynolds made an X-ray set in 1896.
Having been made only the year after the discovery of the phenomenon, the X-ray set is considered one of the worlds oldest and was donated to the [[London Science Museum]], UK in 1938, where it can still be seen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/icons_of_invention/medicine/1880-1939/IC.049/|title=Icons Of Invention: Reynolds' X-ray set, 1896|publisher=[[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]]|accessdate=11 February 2011|location=London}}</ref> In 2009 the British public voted the X-ray machine [http://www.sor.org/stories/x-ray-named-best-invention-anniversary-discovery-approaches the most important modern discovery]".

The first medical X-ray made in the United States was obtained using a discharge tube of Pulyui's design. In January 1896, on reading of Röntgen's discovery, Frank Austin of [[Dartmouth College]] tested all of the discharge tubes in the physics laboratory and found that only the Pulyui tube produced X-rays. This was a result of Pulyui's inclusion of an oblique "target" of [[mica]], used for holding samples of [[fluorescent]] material, within the tube. On 3 February 1896 Gilman Frost, professor of medicine at the college, and his brother Edwin Frost, professor of physics, exposed the wrist of Eddie McCarthy, whom Gilman had treated some weeks earlier for a fracture, to the X-rays and collected the resulting image of the broken bone on [[Photographic plate|gelatin photographic plates]] obtained from Howard Langill, a local photographer also interested in Röntgen's work.<ref name = PKS>{{cite journal

===20th century and beyond===
[[File:Historical X-ray nci-vol-1893-300.jpg|thumb|A male technician taking an X-ray of a female patient in 1940. This image was used to argue that [[Ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]] during the X-ray procedure would be negligible.]]

The many applications of X-rays immediately generated enormous interest. Workshops began making specialized versions of Crookes tubes for generating X-rays and these first generation [[cold cathode]] or Crookes X-ray tubes were used until about 1920.

Crookes tubes were unreliable. They had to contain a small quantity of gas (invariably air) as a current will not flow in such a tube if they are fully evacuated. However as time passed the X-rays caused the glass to absorb the gas, causing the tube to generate "harder" X-rays until it soon stopped operating. Larger and more frequently used tubes were provided with devices for restoring the air, known as "softeners". These often took the form of a small side tube which contained a small piece of mica: a [[mineral]] that traps relatively large quantities of air within its structure. A small electrical heater heated the mica and this caused it to release a small amount of air, thus restoring the tube's efficiency. However the mica had a limited life, and the restoration process was consequently difficult to control.

In 1904, [[John Ambrose Fleming]] invented the [[thermionic diode]], the first kind of a [[vacuum tube]]. This used a [[hot cathode]] that caused an [[electric current]] to flow in a [[vacuum]]. This idea was quickly applied to X-ray tubes, and hence heated-cathode X-ray tubes, called "Coolidge tubes", completely replaced the troublesome cold cathode tubes by about 1920.

In about 1906, the physicist [[Charles Barkla]] discovered that X-rays could be scattered by gases, and that each element had a characteristic X-ray. He won the 1917 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this discovery. 

In 1912, [[Max von Laue]], Paul Knipping, and Walter Friedrich first observed the [[diffraction]] of X-rays by crystals. This discovery, along with the early work of [[Paul Peter Ewald]], [[William Henry Bragg]], and [[William Lawrence Bragg]], gave birth to the field of [[X-ray crystallography]]. 

The [[X-ray tube#Coolidge tube|Coolidge X-ray tube]] was invented during the following year by [[William D. Coolidge]]. It made possible the continuous emissions of X-rays. X-ray tubes similar to this are still in use in 2012.

The use of X-rays for medical purposes (which developed into the field of [[radiation therapy]]) was pioneered by Major [[John Hall-Edwards]] in [[Birmingham, England]]. Then in 1908, he had to have his left arm amputated because of the spread of [[radiation dermatitis|X-ray dermatitis]] on his arm.<ref>Birmingham City Council: [http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/xray Major John Hall-Edwards]</ref> 

The [[X-ray microscope]] was developed during the 1950s.

The [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], launched on July 23, 1999, has been allowing the exploration of the very violent processes in the universe which produce X-rays. Unlike visible light, which gives a relatively stable view of the universe, the X-ray universe is unstable. It features stars being torn apart by [[black hole]]s, galactic collisions, and novae or [[neutron star]]s that build up layers of plasma that then explode into space.

An [[X-ray laser]] device was proposed as part of the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]]'s [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] in the 1980s, but the first and only test of the device (a sort of laser "blaster", or [[death ray]], powered by a thermonuclear explosion) gave inconclusive results. For technical and political reasons, the overall project (including the X-ray laser) was de-funded (though was later revived by the second [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] as [[National Missile Defense]] using different technologies).

[[Phase-contrast imaging#X-ray imaging|Phase-contrast x-ray imaging]] refers to a variety of techniques that use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues. It has become an important method for visualizing cellular and histological structures in a wide range of biological and medical studies. There are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging, all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations.<ref>{{cite journal

==Visibility==
While generally considered invisible to the human eye, in special circumstances X-rays can be visible. Brandes, in an experiment a short time after [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Röntgen's]] landmark 1895 paper, reported after dark adaptation and placing his eye close to an X-ray tube, seeing a faint "blue-gray" glow which seemed to originate within the eye itself.<ref>{{cite web

 |accessdate = 2008-05-19}}</ref> Upon hearing this, Röntgen reviewed his record books and found he too had seen the effect. When placing an X-ray tube on the opposite side of a wooden door Röntgen had noted the same blue glow, seeming to emanate from the eye itself, but thought his observations to be spurious because he only saw the effect when he used one type of tube. Later he realized that the tube which had created the effect was the only one powerful enough to make the glow plainly visible and the [[experiment]] was thereafter readily repeatable. The knowledge that X-rays are actually faintly visible to the dark-adapted naked eye has largely been forgotten today; this is probably due to the desire not to repeat what would now be seen as a recklessly dangerous and potentially harmful experiment with [[ionizing radiation]]. It is not known what exact mechanism in the eye produces the visibility: it could be due to conventional detection (excitation of [[rhodopsin]] molecules in the retina), direct excitation of retinal nerve cells, or secondary detection via, for instance, X-ray induction of [[phosphorescence]] in the eyeball with conventional retinal detection of the secondarily produced visible light.

Though X-rays are otherwise invisible it is possible to see the [[ionization]] of the air molecules if the intensity of the X-ray beam is high enough. The beamline from the [[Wiggler (synchrotron)|wiggler]] at the [http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/Experiments/MaterialsScience/faisceau ID11] at [[ESRF]] is one example of such high intensity.<ref>{{cite book

==Units of measure and exposure==
The measure of X-rays [[ionization|ionizing]] ability is called the exposure:
*The [[coulomb]] per [[kilogram]] (C/kg) is the [[Systeme International|SI]] unit of [[ionizing radiation]] exposure, and it is the amount of radiation required to create one coulomb of charge of each polarity in one kilogram of matter.
*The [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] (R) is an obsolete traditional unit of exposure, which represented the amount of radiation required to create one [[electrostatic unit]] of charge of each polarity in one cubic centimeter of dry air. 1 roentgen = 2.58×10<sup>−4</sup> C/kg.

However, the effect of ionizing radiation on matter (especially living tissue) is more closely related to the amount of [[energy]] deposited into them rather than the [[electric charge|charge generated]]. This measure of energy absorbed is called the [[absorbed dose]]:
*The [[gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy), which has units of (joules/kilogram), is the SI unit of [[absorbed dose]], and it is the amount of radiation required to deposit one [[joule]] of energy in one [[kilogram]] of any kind of matter.
*The [[rad (unit)|rad]] is the (obsolete) corresponding traditional unit, equal to 10 millijoules of energy deposited per kilogram. 100 rad = 1 gray.

The [[equivalent dose]] is the measure of the biological effect of radiation on human tissue. For X-rays it is equal to the [[absorbed dose]].

*The [[Roentgen equivalent man]] (rem) is the traditional unit of equivalent dose. For X-rays it is equal to the [[Rad (unit)|rad]], or, in other words, 10 millijoules of energy deposited per kilogram. 100 rem = 1 Sv.
*The [[sievert]] (Sv) is the SI unit of [[equivalent dose]], and also of [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]]. For X-rays the "equivalent dose" is numerically equal to a [[Gray (unit)|Gray]] (Gy). 1 Sv = 1 Gy. For the "effective dose" of X-rays, it is usually not equal to the Gray (Gy).
